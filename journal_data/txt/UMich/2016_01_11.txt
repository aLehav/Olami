How Sweep It Is

Understaffing 
drives move to 

increase pay from 

$9 to $11

By BECCA SOLBERG

Daily Staff Reporter

In the entrances of all of the 

University dining halls, signs 
read: “$11 per hour. Dining Hall 
jobs. They’re money.”

Starting this semester, the 

wages for dining hall staff 
increased from $9 to $11 in 
order to combat the decrease 
in student applicants and allow 
the workers to have more 
flexible schedules, according 
to Michigan Dining Director 
Steve Mangan.

The 22 percent wage increase 

comes 
after 
a 
significant 

decline in student dining hall 
employees and applicants.

Mangan suggested possible 

factors contributing to this 
decline including “changing 

demographics, higher incomes 
for many of our students and 
more jobs available in town 
and campus” as explanations 
for the drop in employment 
and 
consistent 
dining 
hall 

understaffing.

According 
to 
the 
Office 

of Budget and Planning the 
number of first-year, in-state 
students with parents’ incomes 
above $150,000 has decreased 
from 54 percent to 49 percent, 
however 
for 
out-of-state 

freshman the number increased 
from 68 percent to 76 percent. 
In an interview with the Daily 
in 2014, E. Royster Harper, 
vice president for student life, 
said the University’s difficulty 
finding students to fill campus 
jobs could be associated with 
higher-than-average 
family 

incomes.

School 
of 
Education 

junior Andrew Campbell, a 
Markley 
dining 
employee, 

said understaffing has been 
a problem in his experience 
working at the dining hall prior

Community unifies 

in solidarity to 
discuss current 
racial climate

By DESIREE CHEW

Daily Staff Reporter

About 50 people participated 

in the Martin Luther King Jr. 
Annual Unity March on Sunday 
to honor King’s legacy and bring 
to light current issues of racial 
inequality.

The event was jointly organized 

by the Second Baptist Church of 
Ann Arbor and First Unitarian 
Universalist Congregation of Ann 
Arbor.

The group, consisting mostly of 

churchgoers, marched from the 
Washtenaw County Courthouse 
to the Second Baptist Church. 
They 
waved 
commemorative 

banners and sang songs like the 
“Ballad of Martin Luther King” 
and “We Shall Overcome.”

The event’s organizer Ronald 

Woods, who serves in the Social 
Concerns Ministry of the Second 
Baptist Church, explained that 

the march is a yearly tradition held 
on the second Sunday of January. 
Its purpose is to commemorate 
Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy, 
as well as advocate for issues 
related to racial inequality and 
social justice.

“This is the 34th MLK Unity 

March Program,” he said. “It 
was started in 1983, three years 
before the holiday was federally 
approved. The march this year 
is special because it’s 2016 and 
it is significant to keep forward 
motion going on issues of justice 
and race.”

Rev. Desmond Martin, an 

associate minister at the Second 
Baptist 
Church, 
emphasized 

the significance of the issues 
that were on the agenda of the 
Civil Rights Movement should 
continue to be advocated for 
today.

“Unfortunately many of the 

issues that were relevant when 
the march first started 34 years 
ago are still very, very relevant 
today,” he said. “The battle that 
was being fought was for the soul 
of America and that is still very 
resonant today.”

Sub-commission 
aims to increase 
student awareness 
of opportunities

By EMILY MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

A sub-commission of Central 

Student Government met on 
Sunday with representatives from 
student organizations involved in 
Detroit to foster discussion about 
the University’s role in the city.

CSG and the sub-commission 

form the Detroit Congress and 
aim to prompt connections and 
conversations between student 
organizations to raise awareness 
on campus of opportunities for 
students in Detroit.

The 
CSG 
Commission 
on 

Detroit Engagement has eight 
members from CSG who have 
had experiences with Detroit 
and are passionate about student 
involvement within the city, 

which could be anything from 
music to entrepreneurship.

LSA sophomore Dylan Bennett, 

co-chair of the CSG Commission 
on 
Detroit 
Engagement, 

emphasized the importance of 
student involvement in fostering 
a strong connection with Detroit.

“We 
can’t 
have 
a 
true 

relationship with Detroit if we 
can’t get our students there,” he 
said.

The meeting opened with 

a discussion of the individual 
groups, 
their 
involvement 

with Detroit and their goals 
as organizations. The student 
organizations 
that 
attended 

included 
Detroit 
Partnership, 

Detroit 
Revitalization 
and 

Business Initiative, JDs in the D 
and Seven Mile Music.

A discussion followed about 

the needs and opportunities 
each organization provides to 
the others. LSA senior Alyssa 
Setting is a representative from 
Detroit Partnership, a student-
run organization that encourages

sharp uptick in bills

According to a new study 

done 
by 
the 
American 

Association of State Colleges 
and Universities, the number 

of 
states 
that 
considered 

legislation addressing sexual 
assault on campus in 2015 rose 
significantly compared in past 
years.

26 
states 
considered 

legislation 
that 
addresses 

sexual assaults on campus in 
2015, compared to six states the 
previous year.

Occurrences of sexual assault 

on college campuses are far 
from rare: in a Sept. 2015survey 
conducted by the Association 
of 
American 
Universities, 

23.1 percent of female college 
students reported they had 
experienced 
unwanted 

sexual contact during their 
college years, whether it be 
kissing, touching or unwanted 
penetrative sex.

Ann 
Arbor’s 
deer 
cull, 

which aims to manage the 
city’s growing deer population 
by killing a portion of it, may 
be stopped in its tracks by new 
legal action against the city.

On Friday, plaintiffs of 

the Sanzotta v. The City of 
Ann Arbor court case filed a 
temporary restraining order 
application against the City of 
Ann Arbor in the United States 
District Court in Detroit. The 
motion attempts to cease all 
action toward the deer cull, 
which could begin as early as 
Jan. 1.

arguments 
from 
legal 

representatives of the plaintiffs, 
city and U.S. Department of 
Agriculture — the department’s 
Wildlife Services is conducting 
the cull —Monday.

Should the court rule in favor 

of the plaintiffs and grant a 
preliminary injunction — a legally 
binding 
court 
order 
granted 

before the resolution of a lawsuit 
— the City of Ann Arbor would 
be forced to halt the cull until the 
lawsuit is resolved, even if the suit 
goes to trial. To achieve this, the 
plaintiffs will have to prove to the 
presiding judge they are likely to 

win if the case goes forward.

The lawsuit claims the deer cull 

will create a public safety hazard 
and sidesteps state laws that 
prohibit hunters from carrying 
silenced weapons, which the 
USDA shooters hired to carry out 
the cull will be carrying.

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 

Government website outlines the 
deer management program and 
asserts measures have been taken 
to manage safety concerns.

“The 
deer 
cull 
will 
be 

performed by highly experienced 
USDA sharpshooters who are 
specially 
trained 
to 
conduct 

culls in urban settings with 
precision, accuracy and safety as 
top priorities,” the city website 
states. 
“(The 
cull) 
will 
not 

include allowing the discharge 
of firearms by hunters, residents 
or visitors at any time within city 
limits.”

Barry Powers, the attorney 

representing the plaintiffs in 
the case, said in an interview 
he was confident the Ann Arbor 
administration 
lacks 
legal 

grounds to conduct the cull and 
that he would be able to achieve a 
favorable ruling on Monday.

“If the city had a position that 

would have been formidable, they 
would’ve brought it out by now,” 
said Powers. “We don’t believe 
the city has a good precedent to 
support what it hopes to do.”

Powers said the lack of a 

preliminary injunction against 
the cull would be more damaging 

than if one were to be granted 
because the consequences of the 
former would be irreversible.

“The 
government 
doesn’t 

stand to lose too much (if 
the preliminary injunction is 
granted),” Powers said, “whereas 
if the status quo isn’t frozen, then 
the plaintiffs will be severely 
injured because they will have 
lost peace and lost the right to 
not have wildlife killed in their 
backyard.”

Stephen Postema, Ann Arbor 

City Attorney, was unavailable for 
comment Sunday. In an interview 
with the Ann Arbor News on 
Saturday, Postema maintained 
his belief of the the cull was legal 
and said the city will mount legal 
arguments in court on Monday.

50 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK (JAN. 11, 1966)

State universities jointly sue

Lawyers from both East-

ern 
Michigan 
University 

and Central Michigan Uni-
versity said they would con-
sider joining the University 
in a union lawsuit claiming 
the Hutchinson Act in its 
then-newly amended form 
violated 
Michigan’s 
state 

constitution.

The Hutchinson Act was 

amended in 1965 and would 
have allowed public employ-
ees, including public univer-
sity faculty, to be represented 
by a collective bargaining 
unit.

The amendment would 

have allowed the state legis-
lature to involve itself in what 
were considered internally 
resolved University issues.

The University claimed 

the state legislature had nei-
ther the right to have general 
supervision of the University 
nor the ability to control its 
funds, 

EMU and CMU,sought the 

same autonomy the Univer-
sity did. 

Then-University 
Presi-

dent Harlan Hatcher offered 
no comment, but upper-level 
staff members and officials 
said they welcomed both 
EMU and CMU as co-liti-
gants.

The Board of Regents 

chose to defer any official 
recognition of any union rep-
resenting EMU employees 
until the constitutional sta-
tus of the bill had been deter-

mined.

While 
EMU 
Attorney 

James Tracy said he would 
move to join EMU’s suit with 
the University’s, CMU offi-
cials had been in contact with 
University attorneys were 
preparing pleadings to join 
their suit as well.

Two Washtenaw County 

unions also petitioned the 
court to allow their lawyers 
to intervene in the hearing in 
defense of Public Act 379.

By the time of these events, 

the University had already 
filed its independent lawsuit 
against the amended form of 
the Hutchinson Act, asking it 
be declared unconstitutional.

A2 City Council unanimously 
passes Ackerman’s resolution

Councilmember’s 
first proposal aims 
to collect funding for 

fire protection

By MARLEE BREAKSTONE

Daily Staff Reporter

For the first time in seven 

years, Ann Arbor’s mayor and 
City Council are slated to get a 
raise.

The increase, proposed by the 

city’s Local Officers’ Compen-
sation Commission, amounts to 
about a 1 percent bump in each 
official’s respective salaries — a 
monthly increase of $35 for Ann 
Arbor Mayor Christopher Taylor 
and a $13 monthly increase for 
all 10 City Council members.

The LOCC, a seven-member 

body appointed by the mayor and 
council, suggested the increase 
in a memo before Monday’s City 

Council meeting. The change 
will automatically take effect 30 
days after LOCC’s memo, unless 
two-thirds of city council mem-
bers vote in objection.

The memo proposed that 

annual pay for Mayor Christo-
pher Taylor be raised to $42,860. 
 

Additionally, it recommended 
that the annual pay for council 
members be adjusted to $16,073. 
Currently, Taylor makes $42,436 
and City Council members make 
$15,913.50 annually.

Though the city’s charter 

states that members of Council — 
with the exception of the mayor 
— should serve without compen-
sation, state law allows cities to 
establish an LOCC, which can 
then supersede salary provi-
sions in city charters. Under the 
state law, these changes do not 
require voter approval, unlike 
changes to the city charter. 

If the raise goes into effect, 

the mayor and councilmembers’ 
salaries will collectively total 

$203,587 for each of the next two 
years, a $2,000 overall increase 
compared to previous years.

City Council members gave no 

indication that they objected the 
proposed change in compensa-
tion at Monday’s meeting.

“This pay raise is just one 

more cup of coffee at one more 
meeting,” said City Council-
member Sabra Briere (D-Ward 
1). “It’s not a big deal.”

Taylor, who nominated a 

majority of LOCC’s current 
appointees, said he was willing 
to accept whatever determi-
nation the commission made, 
whether that was an increase or 
decrease in pay.

In an interview Wednesday, 

Briere said the LOCC did not dis-
close to City Council members 
the criteria used to determine 
the 1 percent pay raise.

She added that the body had 

asked councilmembers to report 
how much time they spent doing 
their jobs prior to meeting in 
December. The LOCC meets 
every two years to discuss pay 
changes.

Briere said that this was the 

first time she had ever been 
asked to explain how much 
time she spent working for the 
community, and that she had 

reported working about 30 hours 
weekly and about 90 to 110 hours 
monthly.

“Honestly, I didn’t feel I was 

being underpaid,” Briere said. 
“I’m not in this for the money. 
The money is convenient, espe-
cially at this point in my life, but 
I didn’t run for office expecting 
to make money. I ran for office 
expecting to work.”

City Councilmember Zachary 

Ackerman (D-Ward 4) echoed 
Briere’s sentiment about the 

increases.

“I don’t think any of us are 

in it for the money,” Ackerman 
said. “We’re all in it to serve the 
community. I know I certainly 
am.”

Pay increases for the mayor 

were more common in past 
years, which saw the mayor’s sal-
ary rise from $18,300 for then-
mayor John Hieftje in 2000 to its 
current level of $42,436 in 2009.

Yearly pay for councilmem-

bers saw a similar trend, rising 
from $9,200 in 1997 to its cur-

rently level of $15,913.50 in 2009.

The rest of the city’s employ-

ees have also seen increases, 
ranging from between 1-3 per-
cent in the past four years. 
Before that, from 2009 to 2012, 
most city employees saw little to 
no pay increases as the city expe-
rienced budget challenges. Some 
voluntarily accepted decreases 
in pay in order to help close bud-
get gaps, such as the Ann Arbor 
firefighters, who experienced a 3 
percent pay decrease in 2010.

Teacher “sickout” 
threatens to close 
one-third of Detroit 
public schools

Detroit Public Schools teachers 

plan to stragically close at least 35 
schools with a “sickout” today. The 
sickout was coordinated by a group 
of teachers calling themselves 
“Detroit Strikes to Win.” The 
group spent more than 90 minutes 
discussing potential strikes last 
Saunday before settling on the 
sickout. Former teacher union 
president Steve Conn leads the 
group and other members of the 
group are upset with what they 
believe is the devastation of the 
Detroit Public Schools system.

Detroit Public Schools teachers 

are dissatisfied with their 
compensation and the school 
district’s poor finances, and today’s 
planned sickout is only one of 
several. Just last week, Cass Tech 
High School closed because of a 
strategic sickout, also planned by 
Conn. Gov. Snyder wishes to pay off 
the school system’s debt and spin 
off a new district, but currently 
lacks the support to do so.

According to Conn, it is believed 

that at least 35 schools in the 
district will be succsessfully closed 
because of the strategic, collective 
sick day. Approximately one-third 
of DPS’s schools would be closed 
should the 35 targeted schools fail 
to open today. 

$1.3 billion 
Powerball jackpot 
causes frenzy

As the Powerball jackpot 

continues to approach world 
record status, a growing number of 
people are purchasing tickets for a 
chance at the current largest prize 
in the world. Estimates expect 
the prize to grow to $1.3 billion by 
Wednesday night’s drawing.

According to Executive Director 

of the Texas Lottery, Gary Grief, 
on Saturday night more than $1.2 
million worth of Powerball tickets 
were being purchased each minute. 
The current expected prize is twice 
as large as the previous national 
lottery record — $656 million in 
2012’s Mega Millions jackpot.

Last October, Powerball officials 

adjusted the lottery’s matrix, 
making it more difficult to win the 
grand prize. While the previous 
chance of winning the big payout 
was one in 175 million, it is now 
one in 292 million. However, the 
chances of winning anything at all 
rose from one in 32 to one in 25.

The recent chaos signals a 

turnaround for the lotto industry 
after recent declines in sales due 
to competition from casinos and 
scratch-off games.

Award-winning 
Polish Jews 
museum curator to 
speak at UMMA

Barbara Kirshenblatt-

Gimblett, chief curator of the 
core exhibition at the POLIN 
Museum of the History of Polish

LSA junior Joanna Leung, president of Seven Mile Music, speaks about the funding issues her organization faces at a 
Detroit Congress meeting in the Union on Sunday. The congress brought together student organizations that focus 
on Detroit and was hosted by CSG’s Detroit Commission.

community service in Detroit 
communities. She encouraged 
organizations to participate in 
their DP Day, an annual service 
program in Detroit.

MBA student Steve Worthy 

said the main opportunity his 
group, Detroit Revitalization 
and Business Initiative, offers 
is the connections with the 
people with whom his group 
has 
interacted. 
The 
group 

works with entrepreneurs in the 
Detroit area in order to foster 
long-term relationships.

“The biggest thing my group 

can offer is those connections 
to the city both professional and 
personal,” he said.

Transportation 
between 

Detroit and Ann Arbor was one 
of the major issues discussed. 

LSA junior Joanna Leung of 
Seven Mile Music expressed 
concern over funding for the 
vans that transport students 
to Detroit communities twice 
a week to provide musical 
instruction to young students.

“We need a lot of funding on 

a consistent basis,” she said. “It’s 
hard to put on paper, especially 
when the application is asking 
for a one-time event.”

CSG discussed the Detroit 

Connector as a possible solution 
for financial issues associated 
with 
travel. 
The 
Detroit 

Connector is a bus providing 
transportation 
between 
Ann 

Arbor and Detroit. They plan 
to make students more aware 
of the Detroit Connector and to 
work with the provost’s office to 
make the bus schedule and stops 
more convenient and efficient 
for individual students and 
student organizations.

The meeting ended with 

a discussion of a question 
concerning Detroit, a format 
Rohin 
Patel, 
chair 
of 
the 

Commission 
on 
Detroit 

Engagement, wishes to continue 
in order to continue [COPY: 
use 
different 
word 
since 

“continue” is used twice in a 
row] conversation about the city. 
During this meeting he asked 
why students may be disinclined 
to travel to Detroit.

Setting offered an answer 

regarding 
this 
inquiry 
by 

addressing what she thinks 
are untrue assumptions about 
Detroit.

“One of the biggest things 

that’s 
either 
straining 
the 

relationship with Detroit or 
limiting it is a lack of factual 
knowledge,” she said. “People, 
especially from out of state, hear 
a lot of things about Detroit that 
aren’t necessarily true.”

march, who came out despite 
the cold and fresh snow, shared 
similar 
sentiments. 
Cheryl 

Ervin, a retired teacher and 
union leader, has not missed a 
march since she moved here.

“This is a good way to show 

that you strongly believe in 
what you do and you get out on 
days like this and march for it,” 
she said.

Ervin said her involvement 

in the civil rights movement 
began in her hometown of 
Birmingham, Alabama.

“I knew what it meant to be 

segregated and not to have,” she 
said. “So I always want to make 
sure everybody has. Everybody 
gets a share of the things that 
are out here, not just a few. It’s 
just like that saying, ‘a rising 
tide lifts all boats.’ ”

The need to engage youth 

in advocacy and social justice 
was reinforced by Dr. Steven 
J. Daniels Sr., the new pastor 
of the Second Baptist Church. 
Having 
arrived 
here 
from 

Virginia 
just 
nine 
months 

earlier, Daniels attended the 
march for the first time and 
brought his family along.

“When I tell my 9-year-

old son about MLK’s fight 
for equality, it is kind of hard 
— looking at the Ann Arbor 
we live in now, when you see 
classrooms filled with African 
American, Caucasian, Asian, 
Latino brothers and sisters — 
for him to see them in class and 

realize that there was a time 
where he had to be with his 
own race and own culture,” he 
said.

He additionally stressed the 

need to preserve the history 
of struggle in the younger 
generations.

“The 
diversity 
that 
we 

experience especially in the 
public school system has been 
incredible,” he added. “But it is 
important for my son to realize 
that this comes on the backs of 
others. This is not a birthright, 
but this is something that 
was earned and we’ve got to 
appreciate it.”

Stephon Smith, a 17-year-old 

who serves as the drummer 
on the church worship team, 
readily assumed responsibility 
to carry on the work that 
Martin Luther King Jr. started.

“He inspires me to stand up 

for what’s right and stand firm 
for my beliefs, no matter who 
thinks they are stupid or don’t 
care,” Smith said.

The 
march 
was 
not 

exclusively attended by the 
Black 
community. 
Other 

members of the congregation 
turned up to walk in solidarity 
with the cause. Cindy O’Connor, 
a first-time attendee of the 
march, said she was compelled 
to come by recent events.

“Because of Black Lives 

Matter, 
the 
issue 
of 
race 

inequality 
has 
been 
so 

prevalent,” she said. “It has 
become unconscionable and 
I can’t take it anymore. So I 
wanted to make a physical 
statement.”

to the announcement of the 
wage increase. Campbell said 
especially in a such a populated 
building like Markley, when the 
dining hall got busy and they 
were short staffed, they had to 
close sections of food and “not 
serve certain dishes, or make 
just pizza because we just didn’t 
have enough people.”

Students 
have 
already 

responded to the long-needed 
wage increase — last week 
alone, University dining had 

already hired close to 200 new 
students.

LSA 
freshman 
Julia 

Bublitz, also a Markley dining 
employee, described a similar 
experience working in what she 
believed was an understaffed 
dining hall.

Campbell 
said 
fellow 

employees were very happy 
with the University’s decision 
to increase wages.

“People are thrilled,” he said. 

“It’s really nice to go to from $9 
to $11. I think we are all really 
grateful and really appreciate 
it.”

surrounding sexual assault on 
college campuses, they decided 
to gather hard data on the 
subject.

Mollie 
Benz-Flounlacker, 

AAU’s associate vice president 
for 
federal 
relations, 
said 

the climate survey was an 
important first step.

“It put a lot of pressure on 

schools to do more and to do 
it better and faster. Because if 
you don’t have hard facts there 
isn’t much you can do.,” Benz-
Flounlacker said. “We feel very 
good about this first step and 
giving our campuses some real 
data on this issue.”

The 
state 
of 
Michigan 

and the University are no 
exception to these significant 
numbers 
— 
about 
30 

percent 
of 
undergraduate 

women 
at 
the 
University 

reportedexperiencing 
nonconsensual 
penetration 

or sexual touching by force 
or 
incapacitation 
during 

their time at the University. 
However, 
while 
the 
issue 

of sexual assault on college 
campuses has captured the 
attention of both federal and 
many state governments, who 
have taken action to combat 
sexual assaults on campus, 
in the state of Michigan, the 
formation of sexual assault 
policy is left up to individual 
universities.

Nationally, 
legislation 

requiring affirmative consent 
by both parties was considered 
by 13 states and ultimately 
passed in two. Six states 
discussed noting incidences 
of 
sexual 
assault 
on 
the 

perpetrators 
transcript 
and 

three states created legislation 
to have it noted under certain 
circumstances. 
Additionally, 

seven states enacted legislation 
to ensure victims have access 
to medical assistance — such 
as to Sexual Assault Forensic 
Examination kits — free to 
them on college campuses. 
Other 
legislation 
included 

mandatory 
Memorandum 

of 
Understanding 
which 

explain the roles of municipal 
governments and university 
administrations in the case 
of a sexual assault, requiring 
confidential 
advisors 
for 

students 
on 
campuses, 

mandatory periodic campus 
climate surveys, discussion of 
“Good Samaritan” provisions 
offering 
drug 
and 
alcohol 

amnesty to witnesses who 
report a sexual assault, and 

consideration of mandatory 
minimum 
punishments 
for 

perpetrators.

Michigan did not present 

any state laws regarding the 
above topics in recent years, 
and 
policies 
at 
individual 

universities 
vary. 
However, 

a 
$500,000 
appropriation 

was approved by the state 
legislature last year for projects 
addressing the issue.

The appropriation, which 

universities across the state 
applied to in a competitive 
process, aimed to encourage 
students and school officials to 
work together to prevent sexual 
assault 
on 
their 
campuses 

through new initiatives.

At the University itself, 

the current policy on sexual 
misconduct has been in place 
since August 2013, though 
discussions about revisions to 
it are ongoing. The policy aims 
to explain how the University 
will handle student sexual 
misconduct, 
maintain 
their 

institutional values and meet 
legal obligations that fall under 
Title IX. Title IX is part of 
the Education Amendments 
adopted in 1972. It states that 
“no person in the United States 
shall, on the basis of sex, be 
excluded from participation 
in, be denied the benefits of, or 
be subjected to discrimination 
under any education program 
or activity receiving federal 
financial assistance…” which 
includes sexual misconduct as a 
form of sexual discrimination.

The University is among 124 

higher education institutions 
currently under investigation 
by the U.S. Department of 
Education’s Office for Civil 
Rights for mishandling sexual 
assault cases, prompted by two 
Title IX complaints, one of 
which involved a 2009 sexual 
misconduct 
case 
against 

former 
Michigan 
football 

kicker Brendan Gibbons.

LSA senior Nico Espinosa, 

a 
peer 
educator 
at 
the 

University’s 
Sexual 
Assault 

Awareness 
and 
Prevention 

Center, which is helping lead 
the 
revision 
process, 
said 

the organization is currently 
in the process of altering 
various parts of the policy. In 
particular, he said changes 
being made include changing 
some definitions and adding 
in more language to the policy, 
such 
as 
the 
definition 
of 

consent.

The 
University 
currently 

defines 
consent 
as 
an 

agreement expressed in either 
words or actions to engage in a 
particular activity.

POLICY
From Page 1A

“The previous policy didn’t 

enforce the verbal component as 
much as we did at SAPAC and we 
would like to include it because 
it came up in certain cases,” 
Espinosa said.

Overall, with the influx of 

data on campus sexual assaults, 
including AAU’s survey, Benz-
Flounlacker said — as signalled 
by the rise in legislatures tackling 
the issue — policy changes are 
likely on the horizon.

“There is already a lot of 

national discussion about this 
issue. There needs to be more 
attention to this issue because 
this is a major problem on 
campuses,” 
Benz-Flounlacker 

said.

S

ince I was a naive middle-schooler, 
eager 
to 
obtain 
any 
sliver 
of 

information that would aid me in 

the 
competitive 
college 

admissions process, I have 
been told finding a passion 
is the key to standing out — 
in both life and through an 
application. I was also told 
it especially helps when one is particularly 
good at whatever passion he or she pursues — 
whether it be mastering the piano, becoming 
fluent in Portuguese or receiving a scholarship 
to play collegiate-level basketball. At first, 
as most awkward and self-conscious eighth 
graders are, I felt lost and like I had nothing I 
particularly cared about or was talented at. I 
loved to write, but after having fallen in with 
the “popular and sporty” crowd (mind you, 
this was self-designated), I felt like I could 
no longer explore that aspect of myself. I 
mentally packed up my well-worn notebooks 
and remnants of poems and shoved them 
far into the back realms of my mind to make 
room for “new passions,” or rather, pursuits 
that I deemed more exciting and cool.

Throughout middle school I had run cross 

country for social reasons, but as I entered 
high school, I realized I had some natural tal-
ent, and decided I wanted to take my train-
ing to the next level. After I started winning 
races and setting personal records every 
other week, I quickly, along with my family 
and friends, began to identify myself as “the 
runner.” I was the one who ate extremely 
healthily, always left parties early so I could 
get a good amount of sleep and could be seen 
running through town at all hours of the 
day. Though on the outside it looked like I 
was achieving all of my goals, I was actually 
spiraling deeper and deeper into unhealthy 
behaviors. As I progressed through high 
school, my eating habits became border-
line disordered, I would lash out or become 
extremely irritated if an event occurred that 
disrupted my workout schedule and I began 
to stray from any interesting activities that 
disrupted my running. After my debate team 
won the state championship, I went as far as 
to skip the celebration afterward so that I 
could get a second run in that day. Running 
consumed my life to the point that there was 
room for absolutely nothing else.

Sadly, life has a funny way of working itself 

out, and at the height of my obsession, I devel-
oped a stress reaction in my femur and was 
forced to stop the very “passion” that fueled 
my daily routine. Injuries are saddening to 
anyone, but because I had chosen to so closely 
tie my entire identity to being a runner, I no 
longer knew who I was anymore. I cried for 
days, withdrew from my friends, and lashed 
out at all of my family members. Eventually 
my bones healed, but it took me yet another 
injury — during my last season of cross coun-

try — to realize I needed to change the way I 
was living my life.

Though injuries took a lot away from my 

high school running experience, I’ve been 
so lucky to have the opportunity to run cross 
country and track for the University of Mich-
igan. However, instead of continuing down 
my previous path of single-minded obses-
sion, I have been much more comfortable 
with attempting the so sought-after concept 
of finding “balance”. I’ve finally realized that 
academics are, indeed, much more important 
than athletics, and I am not afraid to run a 
workout on a few hours of sleep in order to 
complete an assignment or feel confident 
walking into a test the next morning. There 
are so many interesting clubs I want to join 
and people I want to meet. Luckily, I am only 
a freshman and still have an entire collegiate 
career ahead of me. Yes, I am a runner, but I 
have realized that is only a small aspect of my 
complete persona. I am so much happier and 
healthier, and actually running faster than 
ever before.

Obviously, running is the example that 

is most pertinent to me, but this pitfall of 
pigeonholing oneself into one particular role 
can happen to anyone. I have friends who see 
themselves as “the artist,” “the musician” 
or “the partier” — and not much else. Pas-
sions are important and a major part of what 
makes life so unique, yet your singular pas-
sion (or what you do to look good on an appli-
cation) does not define you. Human beings 
have a multitude of interests that should be 
explored, redefined and uncovered as they 
grow and change. In recent years, we seem to 
have settled into the dangerous thought pat-
tern that it is important to be “really, really 
good” at one thing, rather than talented in 
a wide variety of areas. But when that one 
thing does not work out, we are left feeling 
like we are nothing at all.

College is the perfect time to explore all of 

these interests, especially in a community as 
large and diverse as the University of Michi-
gan. The new year is the perfect time to take a 
step back, slow down and explore some of the 
interests and opportunities you thought you 
didn’t have time for while you were too busy 
being an athlete, business major or member of 
Greek life. Continue to grow and succeed and 
fail and experience all of the infinitesimal, 
wonderful and tragic moments that combine 
to make one’s college experience. We have 
the freedom to follow an infinite number of 
paths, and not get bogged down by others’ (or 
even our own) expectations of us. This was 
a concept that took me two broken bones to 
realize. In the words of writer Thomas Mer-
ton, “Happiness is not a matter of intensity 
but of balance, order, rhythm and harmony.”

Balancing passion and sanity

The other gap

L

et’s talk about the “gap.” No, 
not the wage gap that has 
had everyone in a fuss lately 

— 
I’m 
talking 

about the orgasm 
gap. 
Hooking 

up has become 
increasingly 
popular 
among 

people 
in 
our 

generation, but there’s a major 
disparity in what each gender is 
getting out of the deal. Casual sex 
can be great as long as there is 
consent; however, when the main 
goal is the Big O and only one side is 
experiencing it, we have a problem.

Every day, women fight myriad 

gender biases related to sex: The 
media portrays them as shrewd — 
simply tolerant of dicks rather than 
having real agency — and women 
who speak openly about enjoying 
sex are labeled as crude or vulgar, 
perpetuating the double standard 
of sluts versus players.

Women are casually hooking 

up, but losing the game. There’s no 
such thing as being sexually pow-
erful and independent if you don’t 
demand to finish. When women 
are hooking up but not climaxing, 
the double standard is perpetuated. 
Women become playthings instead 
of mutual partners in an agreement 

for pleasure. How many times have 
you had your head shoved “down 
there” or just laid there thinking 
about that project that’s due Fri-
day? If it seems like women don’t 
want casual sex, maybe it’s because 
the kind we’re used to having isn’t 
cutting it. Why waste time having 
sex when we can get more pleasure 
out of a glass of wine and Netflix?

“But I’m a sex god and make 

every girl I’m with scream” … 
Yeah, ok. Let me just point you to 
one of my favorite movies. Watch 
“When Harry Met Sally.” Actu-
ally, you don’t even have to watch 
the whole film — one pivotal 

diner scene gets the point across. 
Women are good at faking it. Plain 
and simple. We do it to avoid hurt-
ing egos, we do it to end a boring 
session, we do it all the time and 

we’re damn good at it. But this is 
not anything new — women read-
ing this column know that. The 
question is: Why don’t men care 
enough to change the way they act 
toward us in bed? Men complain 
and joke about us being prudes and 
not ever being “in the mood.” Well, 
the answer to the problem is clear.

To all the women out there, why 

don’t we all just pull a Carrie Brad-
shaw and start having sex like men 
— making sure we get what we want 
then leaving them high and dry? 
Amy Schumer did it in her movie 
“Trainwreck.” She made a bro move 
and just pushed his head down there 
and fell asleep. But the fact of the 
matter is if women start hooking up 
like men, it’s just going to begin a 
vicious cycle of taking without giv-
ing. Nobody is ever going to win this 
battle for the ultimate prize, so why 
don’t we all just agree that there is 
a problem and make moves to fix it. 
The orgasm gap is a fun one to fill 
and it doesn’t take much effort. So 
men, think about that next time you 
casually hop into bed with some-
one. And ladies, climaxing is not too 
much to ask for if you’re going to get 
naked with someone.

We need affirmative action

I

f you’re white and you’re 
against 
affirmative 
action 

because you think it’s “racist,” 

I 
have 
news 

for you: This is 
perpetuating 
a 
system 
that 

privileges 
white 
people. 

And white privilege is a product 
of racism. Have you ever thought, 
“This 
is 
unfair! 
Why 
should 

minority 
students 
have 
an 

advantage over me in the college 
process?” Guess what, you have an 
advantage over them in almost any 
other area of life. Harvard sociology 
professor Devah Pager conducted 
a 2007 study that observed how 
race and incarceration affect the 
economy on a large scale for her 
book titled “Marked: Race, Crime, 
and Finding Work in an Era of Mass 
Incarceration.” She found that a 
white man who just left prison is 
equally as likely to get hired as a 
Black man with no criminal record. 
Do you think that seems fair?

At the University, I have sat 

in many a classroom marked by 
homogeneity with a white major-
ity. According the University’s 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
site, University President Mark 
Schlissel has a plan to combat this 
issue. This plan involves teach-
ins, talks and guest speakers. To 
be honest, I am skeptical this will 
promote any true progress.

The 
reality 
is, 
to 
achieve 

true inclusion, we must start by 
increasing the diversity of our 
student body’s racial and cultural 
makeup. The University needs 
affirmative action.

Last April, the Supreme Court 

upheld a Michigan law that made 
considering race in the admissions 
process illegal for public universi-
ties. This decision focused on the 
constitutionality of the issue. The 
associate justices wrote more than 
100 pages of opinion on this dif-
ficult decision. This is a sensitive 
issue, and the justices displayed a 
wide variety of opinions. Justice 
Sonia Sotomayor famously wrote 
that she believes affirmative action 
got her to Princeton and to where 

she is today. Her emotional piece 
explains the experience of many 
minority students who are given 
the opportunity to succeed at a 
prestigious university. Affirmative 
action remains illegal in Florida and 
California as well. Though many 
want to believe we live in a post-
racial society in which everyone is 
seen equally, we do not. So rather 
than pretending we’ve made such 
progress, we need to start working 
toward better inclusion.

People of my generation are 

extremely committed to promoting 
inclusion and diversity. We have 
seen this at Mizzou, Yale and many 
other universities and institutions 
over the past several months. Many 
college students feel strongly that it 
is time for a change and are willing 
to fight for it.

I have seen this initiative for 

change get brushed over at the Uni-
versity. There were a few student 
demonstrations, many articles writ-

ten and a public statement from 
Schlissel, who talks a lot about 
improving diversity issues without 
a lot of progress. The desire is there, 
but not the action. I stand by and 
watch as the University desperately 
reaches for some kind of change, but 
can’t seem to find it. The problem lies 
within the makeup of the student 
body. The Office of the Registrar 
states that less than 5 percent of the 
entire student body is Black, and less 
than 5 percent is Hispanic. Mean-
while, according to the 2014 census, 
the state of Michigan is 19 percent 
Black and Latino, and the United 
States is about 30 percent Black and 
Latino. Without accurate represen-
tation of these minority groups, we 
will never create the change we so 

desperately need. In order for all 
University students to have an aca-
demic experience that involves mul-
tiple perspectives and ideas, there 
should be greater diversity.

Let me now address some of your 

concerns. You might be under the 
impression that affirmative action 
makes the college process unfair, 
as it gives people an advantage 
just because of their race, some-
thing they have no control over. Is 
it fair that some students get a full 
scholarship based on their ath-
letic ability? What about having 
an expensive ACT tutor or going to 
a private school with smaller and 
more engaging classes? In-state 
versus out-of-state? Is any of this 
fair? Some students may have spent 
high school focusing on saving up 
for their tuition rather than focus-
ing on their GPA. Nothing about 
this process is fair. Some students 
come from families wealthy enough 
that the admissions office sees only 
a dollar sign when they read their 
application. Why stop at affirma-
tive action? Why stop where an 
advantage in the process will allow 
all students to grow by improving 
the diversity of the student body?

None of this is to say that I think 

that students of color do not have 
the academic ability or drive to get 
into prestigious universities on their 
own. Rather, many are disadvan-
taged by their life experiences, and 
deserve a leg up to compensate for 
earlier obstacles. Students of color 
often come from families less likely 
to afford tutors and expensive testing 
to receive much-needed extra time, 
among many other disadvantages.

Our country has a history of 

hundreds of years of enslavement, 
torture and other horrors white 
Europeans inflicted upon people 
of color. We cannot even the play-
ing field by pretending it never 
happened. We must work toward a 
system of equality and change. If 
the University of Michigan wants 
to achieve a truly diverse stu-
dent body, we must begin with the 
admissions process.

G.O.O.D. MUSIC

Oh hey, almost didn’t see you there.
Pusha T returns 
dopely on ‘Dawn’

By SHAYAN SHAFII

Daily Arts Writer

Pusha T has been quiet for a 

very, very long time. In the fall 
of 2013 he released what was 
shockingly 
his first solo 
album, 
My 

Name Is My 
Name, 
and 

has given us 
nothing more 
than a handful 
of 
features 

since. Where 
seasoned 
hip-hop 
heads 
were 

more 
than 

familiar with his earlier work 
with Clipse (dating back to 
2002), 
newer 
uninformed 

fans aggregated quickly once 
he signed to Kanye West’s 
G.O.O.D. Music imprint in 2010. 

As Pusha T has grown 

older since parting ways with 
Malice, 
he’s 
become 
more 

noticeably distant from the 
cokeboy lifestyle that once 
fueled his raps (“I was really 
in that Travelodge!!!”). He now 
does interviews with CNN, 
rocks Balmain, and quietly 
enjoys his influential grip on 
the rap game. Darkest Before 
Dawn, though not even his 
proper sophomore LP, is a rare 
opportunity to hear from the 
man himself, and he evidently 
has a lot to say.

Darkest Before Dawn plays 

out a lot like “Scarface,” except 
without the scene where the 
police raid his home. He just 
wins, but it’s not enough. The 
new King Push seeks justice; 
he doesn’t want his younger 
brethren to go through what 
he went through. For the first 
time, we hear him rap not from 
the perspective of a Miami 
Vice cocaine cowboy, but from 
that of a 38-year-old label 
president who’s seen it all. One 
of the album’s highlights is the 
album-closer, 
“Sunshine”. 
I 

expected the title to be a simile 
for the way his SL 500 gleams 

in the light or something, but 
instead we got the most socially 
conscious and racially-charged 
song of his career.

The beat drops in layers, à 

la Lil Wayne’s “Let The Beat 
Build,” except with more subtle 
releases. There’s the sound of 
a scream right as Push snarls 
“These ain’t new problems / 
They just old ways / I seen one 
time turn sunshine into Freddie 
Gray!” By the time synths and 
drums chime in, he’s already 
thrown shots at Don Lemon and 
saluted Chief Keef. The song, 
overall, is an unexpected turn 
to close out a Pusha T album, 
but it shows his age. While a 
former Clipse manager is still 
in prison for involvement in a 
national cocaine ring, Pusha 
T has grown old enough to 
philosophize the condition of 
Black America regarding police 
brutality and the war on drugs.

Even the songs that seem 

most hedonistic have serious 
undertones; 
who 
would’ve 

thought that a track titled 
“M.P.A (Money Pussy Alcohol)” 
would be less about celebration 
and more about the potential 
pitfalls 
of 
vices? 
“M.P.A” 

stirred a lot of excitement when 
the tracklist revealed features 
from A$AP Rocky and Kanye 
West, but Push’s first line 
deaded any hopes of a banger: 
“The three leading killers of 
you n****s, is the shit that’s 
most appealing to you n****s.” 
The 
Kanye-produced 
piano 

loop gives the song a mournful 
air not too dissimilar to “Blame 
Game.”

But the album isn’t all 

serious. Tracks like “Crutches, 
Crosses, Caskets” see Push get 
back to his ever-so-poetic shit 
talking. He tiptoes on the beat, 
throwing shade at everyone 
in an aggressive whisper. It’s 
less about making threats and 
more about addressing the 
current state of rap from the 
perspective of a veteran with 
nothing left to prove: “All I see 
is victims!”

Pusha T is in a totally unique 

position in the rap game where 
he has gone from one half of a 
duo adored exclusively by rap 
nerds, to a unanimously well-

respected MC with hardly 
any solo material. He has one 
of the finest discographies in 
rap behind him with Clipse, 
but only caught the nation’s 
attention when he was the 
“dude in the salmon suit” 
during Kanye’s 2010 VMA 
performance. He doesn’t really 
have anything to prove, but 
he kinda does. In the same 
vein as much of the best rap 
music released in 2015, Darkest 
Before Dawn is delivered with a 
certain air of charity about it. 
It’s just something to hold us 
over until he delivers what will 
inevitably be another fantastic 
record: King Push.

FOX tackles racism

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Among the few television 

shows currently on air that talk 
about race in America, FOX’s 
new animated series “Border-
town” is one 
that takes the 
issue head on. 
Originally slat-
ed to appear 
on FOX’s ani-
mated lineup in 
2013, “Border-
town” ’s setup 
involves 
two 

racially diverse 
families 
and 

tackles the “clash between cul-
tures” concept commonly seen in 
TV comedies with promising but 
mixed results. 

From the minds of “Fam-

ily Guy”’s Mark Hentemann 
and controversial animator Seth 
McFarlane, “Bordertown” takes 
place in the fictitious Mexifor-
nia, which sits on the U.S.-Mex-
ico border. There, we meet the 
bigoted border patrol officer Bud 
Buckwald (Hank Azaria, “The 
Simpsons”), who lives next door 
to the amiable Ernesto Gonzalez 
(Nicholas Gonzalez, “Resurrec-
tion Blvd”). As established in the 
show’s manic opening credits, 
there is a subtle shift in class sta-
tus, with the Buckwalds residing 
in a shabby, dull-colored house 
and the Gonzalezes living in a 
pleasant, brightly-colored home. 
In addition to Bud and Ernes-
to’s supportive wives and dys-
functional families, Bud’s shrill 
daughter Janice (Alex Borstein, 
“Family Guy”) and Ernesto’s 
stuffy, college-educated nephew 
J.C. (also Gonzalez) are involved 
in a romantic relationship and 

eventually 
become 
engaged, 

causing racial and cultural ten-
sions to ensue between the two 
families. 

“Bordertown” 
is 
definitely 

timely, using blunt, dark humor to 
underscore stinging sociopolitical 
commentary in the likes of “Fam-
ily Guy,” “American Dad” and 
“South Park.” But while the show 
highlights burgeoning progressive 
ideals in our society — interracial 
relationships, immigration laws, 
cultural assimilation — it tries so 
hard to replicate the insight found 
in the aforementioned animated 
sitcoms that it often misses more 
than it hits. Because “Border-
town” both embraces and satirizes 
PC culture, as well as other issues 
regarding modern America, it has 
trouble balancing between insen-
sitive jokes and engaging social 
consciousness.

The plot in the show’s pilot epi-

sode, “The Engagement,” starts 
off with potential, but quickly dis-
solves into a mediocre retread 
of raunchy animated sitcoms. 
A new anti-immigration law 
is introduced and eventually 
passed, which delights Bud but 
leads to J.C.’s accidental depor-
tation, despite him being a legal 
American citizen. With J.C. and 
Janice’s 
engagement 
threat-

ened, Bud and Ernesto seek to 
retrieve J.C., yet their teamwork 
doesn’t really incite a friendship 
between the two.

Some bits in the pilot elicit a 

laugwh or chuckle, though most 
go for the offensive and taste-
less. But for all “Bordertown”’s 
tiresome aspects, the least devel-
oped are the characters, most of 
whom are (literally) drawn as 
caricatures of their respective 
stereotypes. Bud represents a 
familiarly flawed TV patriarch, 

taking from the oafishness of 
“Family Guy” ’s Peter Griffin and 
“South Park” ’s Randy Marsh, 
but even those characters offered 
some depth and humor to their 
shows. While Ernesto seems 
to be subverting many cultural 
stereotypes, his disposition as a 
family man is his only real defin-
ing characteristic.

The only character who has 

some redeemable qualities is 
J.C., who portrays a modernized, 
assimilated Mexican-American. 
But even as refreshingly honest 
as he can be, J.C. isn’t necessari-
ly likable, especially in one scene 
where he makes an explicitly 
meta reference to how Mexicans 
are commonly depicted. After 
J.C. is ejected from a “deporta-
tion cannon” and lands in Mex-
ico, he finds a throng of people 
gathered around a tortilla that 
allegedly contains the Virgin 
Mary (a phenomenon that appar-
ently happens in real life). J.C. 
interrupts and exclaims that the 
scene “only reinforces a negative 
cultural stereotype,” to which 
the Virgin Mary emerges from 
the tortilla and chastises J.C. 
before returning to heaven. 

It’ll be interesting to see how 

much farther along “Border-
town” will go in the route of 
spotlighting 
relevant 
matters 

regarding racism and immigra-
tion towards Mexican-Ameri-
cans. Perhaps an episode that 
delves into the contradicting 
perceptions of Donald Trump’s 
racist demagoguery in the 2016 
presidential race would make for 
some intriguing television. But 
for now, “Bordertown” needs to 
improve on how it can make its 
budding premise into something 
that is both funny and compel-
ling.

Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

By NOAH COHEN

Daily Arts Writer

J. J. Abrams, Disney whisper-

ing in his ear, calls Star Wars back 
from the brink of irrelevance. “The 
Force 
Awak-

ens” is respect-
ful to the point 
of pandering.

This 
fran-

chise 
took 
a 

lesson 
from 

failure, 
read 

the 
manual, 

and 
followed 

it to a T. We’re 
not frustrated 
with the lack of 
novelty. Rather, 
we’re all breathing a sigh of relief. 
Abrams takes us back to the rak-
ish golden era in terms of plot 
and mood. The Force is with this 
reboot, if tentatively.

The Empire has been struck a 

grave blow, but threatens revival in 
the form of The First Order, knock-
off Nazis with a bigger, badder 
Death Star. The Resistance can’t 
fight back without the last Jedi, but 
Luke Skywalker is nowhere to be 
found. Our only clue to finding him 
is a piece of a map secreted away 
in another adorably booping droid 
who’s been abandoned on a remote 
desert planet to be discovered by a 
plucky, disenfranchised youth bur-
dened with glorious destiny.

The coming years will be a 

trial of our loyalty, but less fright-
ening than the Christenson-era, 
given we have such a personable 
roster of named players. Starting 
with our fresh faces: Daisy Rid-
ley (“Scrawl”), as Rey, unites the 
casual, barely-an-actress vibe of 
Jennifer Lawrence with the self-
possessed screen dominance of 
Anna Kendrick. She’s Luke, except 
with verve. Playing off her straight-
man poise is the comedically out 
of place John Boyega (“Half of a 
Yellow Sun”), playing our traitor-

stormtrooper and beloved knuck-
lehead, Finn. The cherry on top 
is Oscar Isaac (“Ex Machina”), as 
Poe, whose brash charisma lays 
down the framework for Finn and 
Rey’s friendship, if not the opti-
mistic emotional undercurrent of 
the entire flick. We ship Poe with 
everyone.

Ridley is the Disney princess 

of popular demand. Relentlessly 
competent, Rey rides obstinacy 
and coincidence to the apex of 
her galaxy’s needs, sheathed in 
resplendent plot armor and that 
ambiguous weather-hardened late 
youth that screams “violent back-
story.” Her plasticity in the up-
tempo plot is so extraordinary that 
her character arc feels superficial 
at times, as though her life were 
taking the backseat to her heroism. 
But isn’t it always that way, with 
heroes? And if you think Star Wars 
owed you novelty or introspec-
tion, you’re barking up the wrong 
Wookiee.

Ridley has space to grow in the 

next films. “The Force Awakens” 
only sets the pace, and that pace is 
meant to keep us out of breath. We 
come hurtling out of the gate with 
a plot whose velocity defends us 
from our own overthinking. There 
are so many potential throwbacks 
in Star Wars, it would be garish to 
dwell; Abrams, Lord of the Pas-
tiche, picks the right ones. Espe-
cially satisfying Easter eggs include 
the titillating wobble of a light-
saber being summoned, Rey’s cry 
“Stop taking my hand!” (for those 
of us who remember how dopey 
Han looked running with Leia 
in “Empire Strikes Back”), Maz’s 
(Lupita 
Nyong’o, 
“Non-Stop”) 

iconic cantina, ripped from “A 
New Hope”, a dramatic confronta-
tion on a narrow bridge (here there 
be spoilers), and our favorite, Han 
Solo telling us to respect the Force 
and the Jedi while standing in the 
exact same spot on the Millennium 
Falcon that he was standing when 

he told Luke that “hokey religions 
and ancient weapons are no match 
for a good blaster at your side, kid.”

Han Solo (Harrison Ford, “Indi-

ana Jones and the Kingdom of the 
Crystal Skull”) and General Leia 
Organa (Carrie Fisher, “Maps to 
the Stars”) are the wind in this 
movie’s sails. There’s a note of self-
aware absurdity in all sci-fi sto-
ries, and the best ones have a voice 
capable of lampshading on the 
right frequency to keep the world 
in check without breaking charac-
ter. That has always been Han Solo 
for Star Wars, with that shrugging 
smile that dresses down an entire 
universe.

Ford is old guard, and his his-

tory shines though his one-liners 
(“Escape now. Hug later!”); his 
wily leadership recalls Indiana 
Jones and reminds us just how 
much baggage this movie inherits. 
When Ford asks Fisher, “Wasn’t 
all bad, was it?” he’s more than 
just Han, he’s the mouthpiece for 
the audience, a living elegy for late 
20th century geek childhoods, 
unpretentious and organic, shep-
herding the new cast into the fold 
of cultural staples.

But the joy of “The Force Awak-

ens” is majority elegiac. It feels like 
celebrating something that was, 
rather than something that is. We 
thrill in our seats when we see 
General Leia, not because it’s Leia, 
but because we’re excited to see 
Fisher reprising Leia, grateful that, 
so many years later, she’s still there 
for us and nothing has been for-
gotten. The promise of “The Force 
Awakens”is strong, but the script is 
often weak. You leave the theater 
lighter than air, but with nothing 
substantial to savor.

This trial of loyalty isn’t over, but 

“The Force Awakens” is so thick 
with the energy that made us fall 
in love with IV, V and VI, a twenty-
something geek can’t help but have 
a little faith. And mercifully, there’s 
no fucking Jar Jar Binks this time. 

‘Force Awakens’ is 
a new hope for fans

MOVIE REVIEW

“What is this remix of ‘Girls 

Just Want to Have Fun?’ ”

I know. The first time I 

heard 
it 

play, I was 
an 
idiot. 

Bright 
synths 
and drum 
machines 
were 
blasting 
over 
speakers 
in 
the 

Michigan 
League at a school-sanctioned 
East Quad social event, and 
when I tried to figure out this 
unfamiliar song, my friend gave 
me this glare she delights in 
giving me, one that makes me 
question how I’m even smart 
enough to dress myself in the 
morning, before she decided to 
enlighten my world.

“This is Whitney Houston.”
I don’t know how I went so 

far in my life without hearing “I 
Wanna Dance With Somebody 
(Who Loves Me),” but in the 
year since I’ve heard it, I’ve 
been converted. I’m ready to 
say that it’s at least Top 5, if not 
the greatest song of all time.

It may not seem so obvious 

at first. In fact, you might think 
this whole column is a joke. 
I don’t blame you — Whitney 
Houston’s big hit sounds a little 
bit derivative, not just of her 
own work (“How Will I Know”) 
, but of other iconic ’80s artists 
like Cyndi Lauper or even 
Madonna. Its sound, with its 
funky artificial bassline and 
perky keyboard fanfares, is the 
kind of music that defined the 
whole era, and it’s not your fault 
if you think of it as just one of 
many old ’80s hits.

But the genius of “I Wanna 

Dance 
With 
Somebody” 
is 

how perfectly it combines the 
best of both ballads and pop 
hits. Pretty much all of your 
standard “greatest song of all 
time” picks have an enormous 
crescendo — something like 
“Stairway to Heaven,” “All 
My Friends” or “Hey Jude.” “I 
Wanna Dance With Somebody” 
has that huge build-up, but it 

sees no need to start slow. It’s a 
fiery, irresistible pop song from 
start to finish.

It starts with a mere 10 

seconds of warm-up. Someone 
turns on the drum machines, the 
bass enters and Houston tests 
out her voice with a few breathy 
yeahs. Then, already satisfied, 
Houston opens the door of 
our old farmhouse world and 
reveals her own personal Oz, 
colored attractively with the 
best production that money can 
buy. While every other artist is 
shooting off Roman candles, “I 
Wanna Dance With Somebody” 
is a big city fireworks display. 
Like the work of idolized 
queens like Beyoncé or Rihanna 
today, 
Houston 
is 
entirely 

unattainable on this song. We 
can’t sing like her; we can’t get 
our hands on her producers or 
songwriters. We have no access 
whatsoever to the talent she’s 
working with, but she deigns to 
let us in by singing about what 
we’re all feeling.

Then 
Houston 
takes 
us 

down, just for a moment, in 
the first verse. Not enough that 
anybody stops dancing, but 
she pulls it back just for a little 
bit. Importantly, there’s never 
a dull moment in this song, 
but it still needs an ounce of 
ebb and flow, lest its listeners 
burn to a crisp right on the 
dancefloor. But she quickly 
lights it up again, giving voice 
to all our passions as she sings 
the chorus, overwhelming our 
bodies and our brains with her 
search for someone special 
— “I Wanna Dance With 
Somebody.” And every time she 
goes back to the chorus it just 
gets more and more powerful, 
like Houston finds renewed 
energy and focus whenever she 
reminds herself of her goal — 
“Somebody Who Loves Me.”

The key, though, is right 

after the bridge — that moment 
of confusion and uncertainty 
when the roller coaster slows 
to a crawl as it tips over its 
highest point. The final chorus 
hits and it’s one of the most 
ecstatic highs in the history 
of pop music. Her voice gets 
even 
higher, 
more 
frantic, 

like Houston’s going to break 
herself down and collapse on 
this dance floor as she pushes 
herself to the finale or else she’s 
not going to finish the song at 
all. The music starts to wind 
down, but the singer’s not done 
yet. You hear Houston’s gospel 
roots as she hysterically shouts 
“Don’t you wanna dance!? Say 
you wanna dance! Don’t you 
wanna dance!?” because she 
sees the truth in her mind and 
knows it to be undeniably true: 
all that matters as she performs 
on this night is finding someone 
to connect with, someone who 
truly understands her.

“I 
Wanna 
Dance 
With 

Somebody” is a universal epic 
that somehow runs under five 
minutes. It’s a world-shaking, 
breathtaking display of force, 
both vocally and emotionally. 
This 
song 
is 
the 
greatest 

because it gives everybody 
everything 
that 
we 
need, 

focusing on nothing more than 
human connections and the 
love we find through music. If 
the biggest songs ever peak at 
a 10 out of 10, “I Wanna Dance” 
starts at 11 and somehow finds 
a way to turn it up to 99.

Look, I know that from 

“How Will I Know” to “Girls 
Just Want to Have Fun” to 
“Vogue” to “Drunk in Love,” 
you can draw all sorts of 
comparisons to this song. It’s 
not groundbreaking. It doesn’t 
have 
the 
mind-expanding 

poetry of Dylan or the constant 
striving for something greater 
that you hear in Springsteen 
or 
the 
political 
awareness 

of Kendrick Lamar, but nine 
nights 
out 
of 
10 
Whitney 

Houston still reigns supreme 
with this single. I’m not trying 
to diss any of those other artists 
— they’ve all made complex, 
world-changing 
music 
and 

frankly, their work as a whole 
is much more impressive than 
Houston’s. But “I Wanna Dance 
With Somebody” so simply 
cuts to the core of everything 
that we need as music fans. It’s 
not the social commentary of 
political protest, but Houston 
can see into the hearts of all its 
listeners, and she uses her voice 
to immortalize our collective 
burning passion — we all wanna 
dance with someone who loves 
us.

An argument for the

THEISEN

The legacy of an icon

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

Pierre Boulez died last week. I 

wrote this.

Last 
Tuesday, 
the 
French 

composer and conductor, Pierre 
Boulez, passed away at the age of 
90. In the days since, I have been 
struggling to figure out what to say 
about the man — what could I pos-
sibly contribute to the conversation 
among the outpouring of emotion 
and collective grief expressed by 
the musical community? What 
could I, a young and inexperienced 
composer, have to say about one of 
the greatest musical minds of the 
20th century? Over the past few 
days obituaries have been printed 
in most major news outlets across 
the globe, YouTube comment sec-
tions have been filled with sym-
pathetic R.I.P.s and the world’s 
leading orchestras have resolved to 
dedicate concerts to Boulez’s mem-
ory. Compared to what has already 
been said by those who knew and 
loved him, I fear that whatever I 
can contribute about Boulez will 
be inadequate — and yet I also feel 
that I must do my best to express 
what Boulez meant for me and my 
respect for the memory of such a 
legendary figure.

I did not grow up listening to 

Boulez — not even close — but I 
distinctly recall the first I heard 
of him. It was during the summer 
of 2013, and I was reading a book 
called “The Rest is Noise” (a title 
delightfully derived from Prince 
Hamlet’s dying words) by Alex 
Ross, The New Yorker’s music crit-
ic. The book was recommended to 
me by my first composition teacher, 
and I devoured it with an eager 
enthusiasm that continued to grow 
the further I read. Ross’s book was 
a history of 20th century classical 
music which was both entertain-
ing and filled with well construct-
ed prose — and about three fifths 
of the way through, in a chapter 
aptly entitled “Brave New World,” 
a young and dashing Boulez burst 
onto the scene.

I can’t say that my first impres-

sion of Boulez was altogether 
favorable. I found the take-no-pris-
oners attitude of the young radical 
who showed up at Olivier Mes-
siaen’s door in 1944 to be some-
what disconcerting, his extreme 
aesthetic 
pronouncements 
and 

condemnations of all music he 
deemed regressive to be off-put-
ting. Given infamous statements 
such as “[A]ny musician who has 
not experienced — I do not say 
understood, but truly experienced 
— the necessity of dodecaphonic 
music is USELESS,” I came to con-

sider Boulez to be a bully (a view 
aided by the misconception that 
his name was properly pronounced 
“Bou-lay”), and his sonic creations 
seemed to me to be abrasive and 
cacophonous. And yet, I could not 
help but admire his passion, his 
single-mindedness of purpose and 
the purity of his artistic motives. 
Boulez was an extremely purpose-
ful person, rushing forward into 
the no-man’s-land of unexplored 
sonic possibilities and daring oth-
ers to follow him. And they did — 
Boulez soon became the leader of 
the avant-garde, his confidence in 
the veracity of his aesthetic ideas 
a comforting beacon of light in the 
post-war age of anxiety that was 
born in the looming shadow of the 
atomic bomb.

Boulez’s complex compositions 

and pointed polemics served him 
well in his youth, but as he grew as 
a musician, the tone of his philip-
pics began to soften, and he began 
to contribute in different ways 
to the musical discourse. Gradu-
ally he began to conduct, becoming 
known as a director of great skill, 
notable for his eschewing the use 
of a baton. Before too long he was 
in demand as a conductor on both 
sides of the Atlantic, eventually 
equally as famous for his conduct-
ing as for his compositions. In the 
70s he served as music director 

of the New York Philharmonic, 
an appointment which musical 
progressives hoped might drag 
the conservative orchestra into 
20th century repertoire. Further-
more, Boulez founded numerous 
institutions of musical education 
and research, the most famous of 
which was the Institut de Recher-
che et Coordination Acoustique/
Musique, founded to study the sci-
ence of music and sound, as well as 
to facilitate the composition of elec-
troacoustic music.

In the intervening time between 

my reading of “The Rest is Noise” 
and now, my view of Boulez has 
gradually become far less harsh. 
While I still feel that many of his 
criticisms of other composers and 
particular aesthetics were unnec-
essarily scathing, I have come to 
value his unique contribution to 
the great debate of ideas in a way 
that I did not in the past. And while 
I am still not as well acquainted 
with his music as I think I should 
be, I have begun to listen to it much 
more — what I once found strident 
and strange I now hear as beauti-
ful, nuanced and interesting (a shift 
in aesthetic preference which is 
mirrored by a gradual modernist 
encroachment into my own music).

Part of the reason that my view 

of Boulez has shifted so much is 
because I have observed his fin-
gerprints everywhere. I recently 
became interested in the composer 
Kaija Saariaho; as a young woman 
she studied at IRCAM. Two months 
ago, for this publication, I inter-
viewed the composer Tod Macho-

ver about his “Symphony in D”; 
Machover served as the first direc-
tor of musical research at IRCAM, 
and thus worked intimately with 
Boulez. The two were close enough 
that Machover published an obitu-
ary for Boulez in The Washington 
Post. I have heard from some of 
my instrumentalist friends that 
on Tuesday Kenneth Kiesler, the 
conductor of the University Sym-
phony Orchestra, briefly stopped 
rehearsal, saying “I’m sorry, today 
has been a hard day for me — my 
teacher died.”

This past summer, I studied 

composition at the Tanglewood 
Institute in Massachusetts. Three 
of my fellow student composers 
there idolized Boulez with a rever-
ence that stopped just short of con-
structing an altar, a fact which was 
easily recognizable in their music. 
All of us hoped that we might one 
day have the opportunity to meet 
the master. But we realized this 
would have to happen quickly, tell-
ing each other — only half in jest 
— that “he is likely to die any day 
now.”

This expectation didn’t do much 

to stifle the surprise, however, 
when the prophecy was fulfilled. 
It was an odd feeling to know that 
a figure like Boulez was a part of 
the same world which I inhabit — 
however distant from me that he 
was — and that then he wasn’t. A 
few weeks ago I was reading about 
Boulez in “A Concise History of 
Modern Music” by Paul Griffiths 
— and then a few mornings past I 
was reading Paul Griffiths’s Boulez 

obituary in The New York Times. 
Scrolling through the list of other 
articles of his — which bear titles 
like 
“Karlheinz 
Stockhausen, 

Influential Composer, Dies at 79” 
and “Gyorgy Ligeti, Central-Euro-
pean Composer of Bleakness and 
Humor, Dies at 83” — I think I have 
discovered what is most affecting 
about Boulez’s death for me.

Boulez was a remnant of an age 

of stunning musical innovation, a 
member of a rapidly diminishing 
group of 20th century greats who 
still walk the Earth. To Griffiths’s 
list of deceased composers I could 
add Gunther Schuller, Robert 
Ward, Elliott Carter, Lukas Foss, 
Luciano Berio, Lou Harrison and 
William Albright — all of whom 
died within my lifetime — and such 
giants as Aaron Copland, Leonard 
Bernstein, Olivier Messiaen and 
John Cage just a few years before 
I was born. I have no doubt that 
this age too will produce its share 
of greats, but my reverence for the 
accomplishments of past is such 
that I feel melancholy when the 
living links to them begin to wear 
away.

When figures from the past 

begin their eternal residency in 
the past, succumbing to the inexo-
rable march of time and age, I can’t 
help but reflect upon the transitory 
nature of all that we are and do, that 
our acts that will live on only in the 
memories of others — and so with 
reverence we consign Boulez, like 
so many others, to memory and to 
the all encompassing arms of his-
tory.

She sees the 
truth in her 
mind and 
knows it.

Every time she 
goes back to the 

chorus it gets 
more powerful.

Wolverines pound Michigan 
State on Friday, then finish off 

series sweep on Saturday

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan hockey team hasn’t been able to 

sing “The Victors” at Yost Ice Arena since October.

For Michigan coach Red Berenson, that practice 

is a privilege that can only be earned after a series 
sweep.

Those sweeps have been hard to come by, 

though, as Michigan has made a habit of trouncing 
opponents on Fridays before faltering in the second 
game on Saturday.

But this Saturday, the Wolverines finally earned 

that privilege again.

Behind a four-goal outburst in the second 

period, the eighth-ranked Wolverines (4-1-1-1 Big 
Ten, 13-3-3 overall) cruised to a 6-3 victory against 
Michigan State (1-5-0-0 Big Ten, 5-15-2 overall).

“When you come off a good game, like a 7-0 

game against Dartmouth and then end up tying 
the game the next night, that’s not good enough,” 
Berenson said. “When you beat Minnesota 8-3, and 
then you come out and you don’t play as well, and 
you know they’re going to bounce back. That little 
bit of history, I challenged our team last night: Do 
we know how to finish off a weekend?”

For the first 18 minutes, though, the Spartans 

looked like they may have given Michigan its 
answer to Berenson’s question. Michigan State 
appeared to have cracked the code to stopping the 

Michigan’s offense — the same offense that had 
relentlessly poured on nine goals against them 
only a night before in East Lansing.

But after sophomore forward Dexter Dancs 

found twine 18:37 into the first period, the 
floodgates had finally been opened.

Dancs notched his second goal in two games 

after junior center Max Shuart won the puck 
behind net and fed it to him in front for an easy 
finish.

The goal tied the game at one and awoke the 

sleeping 
giant

that was Michigan’s offense.

Michigan 
State 
notched 

its first goal 4:27 into the 
first frame off the stick of 
defenseman Dylan Pavelek.

The Wolverines were caught 

in the middle of a line change, 
and Pavelek came away with a 
breakaway goal to show for it.

Despite 
the 
single 
lapse, 

Michigan’s defense was sharp 
throughout the first frame — 
ensuring Pavelek’s goal would be 
the only one the Spartans could 
muster before the Wolverines’ 
offense broke through.

Yet Michigan struggled to 

create scoring chances, as the 
Wolverines tallied just one shot on 
goal in the opening ten minutes.

Michigan 
managed 
to 

weather the storm while its 
offense sputtered, eventually 
getting the spark they needed 
from Dancs.

Dancs’ 
goal 
appeared 
to 

give Michigan new life, as its 
offensive production exploded 

to open the second period.

Two minutes into the frame 

sophomore defenseman Zach 
Werenski drove a shot at net. 
Michigan State goaltender Jake 
Hildebrand made a good effort 
to deflect the puck, but freshman 
forward 
Cooper Marody 
jumped 
on 

it and lit the 
lamp to give 
Michigan 
its 

first lead of the 
game.

From 
that 

point, 
the 

Spartans 
trailed 
for 

the rest of the 
game.

Just 46 seconds later, junior 

defenseman Michael Downing 
converted a long wrist shot to 
give the Wolverines a 3-1 lead.

Werenski added a goal to 

his stat sheet as well — which 
prompted 
a 
violin-playing 

celebration that earned the 
fans’ cheers of approval — 
before junior forward Tyler 
Motte rounded out the scoring 

for Michigan.

But after jumping out to a 

5-1 lead and appearing to take 
control, unnecessary penalties 
doomed the Wolverines, as the 
Spartans closed the frame with 
two unanswered goals.

For 
a 

moment, 
it 

appeared 
Michigan 
was 
going 

to 
suffer 

through 
the 

same 
fate 

that 
has 

befallen them 
in 
Saturday 

matchups 
since October.

Michigan State was charging 

into the third period, and it 
was looking as if this would 
be another split series for the 
Wolverines.

But the two finishes would be 

the Spartans’ last of the night, as 
Michigan made a stout defensive 
stand for the entirety of the 
third period. Goaltender Steve 
Racine stood tall, facing seven 
shots in the third period and 
finishing with 24 total saves. 
The netminder was impressive 
all night, tallying a number 
of impressive glove saves and 
limiting 
dangerous 
second-

chance opportunities.

“I thought we had a great 

third period,” Racine said. “We 
knew they were going to come 
out hard. I think they had a 
couple of chances early. But we 
stuck with it. They had a couple 
power plays and we did a really 
good job on the kill. After that 
third goal we knew we had to 
bear down and we did a really 
good job in the third.”

Besides 
freshman 
forward 

Kyle 
Connor’s 
empty-net 

goal with 2:22 left to play, the 
Wolverines were held at bay 
once again in the third frame, 
as they tallied 14 shots but came 
away with only one goal to show 
for them.

With its six goals against the 

Spartans, Michigan finished 
the weekend with 15 goals in 
two games.

But more importantly, the 

Wolverines 
got 
over 
their 

biggest hurdle.

They closed out a series.
They were allowed to sing 

“The Victors.”

Sophomore defenseman Zach Werenski returned this weekend and denied the rumor that he is unhappy at Michigan.

Michigan despite reports

Sophomore D-man 

denies rumors 

that he is unhappy 
playing at Michigan

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Writer

Zach 
Werenski 
said 
he 

was having the best time of 
his life at the World Junior 
Championships 
in 
Helsinki, 

Finland. After all, the junior 
defenseman was the United 
States’ captain.

Life was good for Werenski, 

free of distractions, and he 
wouldn’t have preferred to be 
in any other situation. Werenski 
tallied two goals and seven 
assists — the highest point 
total of a defenseman in the 
tournament — en route to being 
named the tournament’s best 
defenseman.

However, on New Year’s Day, 

a Columbus Dispatch article 

irked Werenski. The report said 
Werenski, the eighth pick in the 
2015 NHL Draft, was “unhappy 
in college and thinking of 
turning pro.”

That report is completely 

false, and Werenski called it a 
“terrible rumor.”

“It’s not something you want 

to see while 
scrolling 
through 
Twitter,” 
Werenski said. 
“But 
that’s 

why 
it’s 
a 

rumor and you 
push it off.

“I was kind 

of like, ‘What 
is this?’ when 
I read it and 
put it behind me. At that point, 
I stopped looking at Twitter the 
rest of the tournament.”

Werenski, who has five goals 

and eight assists this season, 
said he does not even know what 
he’s planning to do at the end of 
the season.

“I haven’t even thought about 

what I’m going to do at the end of 
this year,” Werenski said. “I want 
to win at Michigan. That’s my goal, 
and I came back to win a national 
championship, and I think we have 
the team to do that.”

A rumor like this could have 

boded poorly for Werenski, as 

it never looks 
good when a 
player 
wants 

to abandon his 
teammates. 
To solve that 
problem, 
he 

immediately 
sent 
a 
text 

in the team’s 
group chat.

“He put in 

our group chat 

that he is coming back happy 
as ever and we had no doubts 
about it,” said junior forward JT 
Compher.

Thus, 
all 
rumors 
about 

Werenski 
bolting 
Michigan 

should be put to rest. You heard 
it from him.

“I was kind of 
like, ‘What is 
this?’ when I 

read it.”

Forty-eight hours of fun

B

efore the Michigan hockey 
team scored six goals 
against Michigan State 

on Saturday 
to bring its 
weekend total 
to 15, before 
the Wolver-
ines erased 
their one-
goal deficit, 
before they 
even made 
their first line 
change, they 
set the tone 
for how the game was going to go.

In the first shift, Michigan 

State’s Mason Appleton had 
Michigan junior forward Tyler 
Motte lying on the ice in the 
corner of the Wolverines’ zone. 
Junior defenseman Nolan De 
Jong tried to pry Appleton off, 
but Appleton took his time 
getting up. When Motte finally 
got back on his feet, he and 
Appleton were still tangled up — 
and Motte flipped Appleton over 
on his backside.

Sixty minutes, 12 penalties 

and nine goals later, that 
moment felt insignificant. But it 
embodied the rest of the game: 
tight, physical and intense. By 
the final buzzer, Michigan had 
done what it hasn’t been able to 
do all season. It dominated not 
one but both games of the series, 
asserting superiority over its 
in-state rival.

The Wolverines emerged from 

the scrum the same way Motte 
did — skating away, with the 
opponent lying there on the ice.

“I like the fact that our team 

can play from behind and 
continue to play our game,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“And when the puck starts going 
in, we can take a team right out 
of the game.”

Was Michigan the better team? 

Absolutely. Should the Wolverines 
have expected to dominate a less 

talented Michigan State team? 
Probably. Would a hard-fought 
performance against a top-tier 
opponent have been better for 
Michigan’s NCAA Tournament 
resume? Sure.

But this week, Michigan State 

was on the schedule, so all the 
Wolverines could do was keep 
rolling at their rival’s expense.

The last time Michigan played 

the Spartans in a two-game 
series was last March. The 
Wolverines were the better team, 
just like this season. They went 
up to East Lansing on a Friday 
and took care of business, 5-3.

Then, they returned to Ann 

Arbor needing a Saturday 
win to share the Big Ten title 
with Minnesota and earn a 
first-round bye in the Big Ten 

Tournament. Instead, Michigan 
State goaltender Jake Hildebrand 
stopped 37 shots, and the 
Spartans escaped with a 2-1 upset. 
The Wolverines had to win three 
games in three days the following 
weekend 
to make 
the NCAA 
Tournament, 
and they fell 
short. Perhaps 
with a sweep of 
Michigan State 
and a bye in the 
tournament, 
things would 
have been 
different.

The sluggish Saturday 

performances recurred in the 
first half of this season. Going 

into this weekend, in six two-
game series, Michigan had 
dominated its opponents by a 
combined score of 34-17 in the 
series openers but had been 
outscored 18-16 in the finales.

Saturday’s 

game began to 
show similar 
signs. The 
Wolverines 
gave up the 
first goal after 
just 4:27 and 
remained 
behind for 
most of the 
first period.

But they tied the game 

toward the end of the first, 
took control in the second and 
coasted in the third. In the 

end, the better team won. And 
given how Michigan has played 
against lesser opponents this 
season — dropping a Saturday 
game against Robert Morris, 
4-0, and tying another against 
Dartmouth a month later — 
that’s no small feat.

“Our best players are our best 

players,” Berenson said. “They’re 
showing up every night.”

After his team bludgeoned 

Michigan State on Friday, 9-2, 
Berenson challenged his players 
to respond with another good 
performance the next night. 
While they didn’t put together 
their prettiest game, they passed 
Berenson’s test. And they had 
fun doing it.

For Michigan’s first goal Friday, 

junior forward JT Compher 

picked up a turnover, skated in 
from the corner and hammered a 
shot over Hildebrand’s shoulder. 
Saturday, sophomore forward 
Dexter Dancs took a pass from 
behind the net and slid it through 
Hildebrand’s legs. And finally, 
with the game starting to get out 
of hand, sophomore defenseman 
Zach Werenski joined in on the 
action.

The Columbus Dispatch 

reported last week that 
Werenski was unhappy at 
Michigan and thinking of 
turning pro. Werenski saw 
the rumor on Twitter while in 
Finland at the World Junior 
Championships. He refuted 
it after the game Friday 
and again during the game 
Saturday. Midway through 
the second period, he skated 
toward Hildebrand and flicked 
in a wrist shot from the slot, 
then turned back toward the 
Children of Yost and played the 
violin on his arm with his stick.

He certainly appeared to be 

having fun. So did everyone 
else at Yost Ice Arena. The 
Wolverines led, 4-1.

That’s all the weekend seemed 

to be about. Michigan did little 
to bolster its postseason resume, 
save for avoiding a crushing loss. 
It had a large margin for error, 
so any small mistakes played 
little role in the final outcome. 
It wasn’t a turning point, and 
it wasn’t a highlight game. It 
wasn’t Penn State, and it wasn’t 
Minnesota. But it was Michigan 
State, and it was fun.

So while the win shouldn’t 

be overstated, it shouldn’t be 
understated, either. Not every 
weekend can be a statement 
win. Sometimes you just cruise 
onto the next one, leaving your 
in-state rival lying on the ice.

Freshman Olivia Karas fell on both the beam and the uneven bars, but she scored a meet-high 9.950 on the floor exercise in the Wolverines win over No. 7 Georgia.
‘M’ tops Georgia, stays undefeated

By LANEY BYLER

Daily Sports Writer

With 
only 
a 
0.150-point 

difference 
headed 
into 
the 

last event Saturday, the No. 7 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team knew it had to pull a strong 
performance on the floor to 
secure a win at its home opener 
against No. 9 Georgia. To do that, 
the Wolverines had to set aside 
miscues from earlier in the meet 
— and they did just that.

Four Wolverines scored a 9.900 

or above on the floor exercise, 
propelling Michigan to its final 
score of 196.925, trumping the 
Bulldogs’ 195.200. Among these 
gymnasts were senior Briley 
Casanova and freshman Olivia 
Karas, both of whom achieved 
career-high scores on the floor, a 
9.900 and 9.950, respectively.

Karas started strong on the 

vault, earning the highest score of 

a 9.900, and took first in the event. 
After making mistakes on the bars 
and beam, she made a tremendous 
comeback on the floor event to tie 
for first with a score of 9.95 with 
junior Nicole Artz.

“That’s what happened tonight, 

we had mistakes,” said Michigan 
coach Bev Plocki. “But the other 
five were able to come through 
and do what we needed to do for 
the team. That’s part of learning 
the college way. I think this was a 
great learning experience for her.”

Artz’s contributions in all areas 

of the meet propelled Michigan 
to the win as she matched her 
previous career high on the floor 
with a 9.950, tying with Karas. 
Artz also walked away with three 
more 
achievements, 
including 

being the all-around champion 
with a score of 39.450, and tied 
junior Talia Chiarelli for first in 
the balance beam exercise with a 
score of 9.875. Artz also tied for 

first with Georgia’s Sydney Snead 
on the uneven bars with a score of 
9.900.

“Nicole is a kid on our team who 

works hard every day,” Plocki said. 
“She never takes shortcuts, and she 
works just as hard in the classroom. 
She’s a tremendous student and a 
tremendous athlete. She leads by 
example. She works hard, but she 
doesn’t take herself too seriously. 
I think that’s what endears her to 
everybody and makes them want 
to follow her as a leader.”

Chiarelli also spent some time 

on the podium, earning a third-
place finish on the floor with a 9.925 
and a second place finish on the 
vault with a 9.875. Her consistency 
and strong performances helped 
Michigan maintain its lead over 
Georgia and keep a hold on its 
undefeated season.

“I don’t really think about 

personal too much,” Chiarelli 
said. “As a team, we just wanted 

to have another great meet. 
We came off of a great meet in 
Cancun (Mexico) last week, so we 
just wanted to stay consistent and 
keep the energy up and fix a few of 
the smaller things.”

Despite 
initially 
trailing 

Georgia after the first event, the 
Wolverines made a solid return 
while on rotations for the bars 
and beam, establishing a small 
lead they would maintain for the 
rest of the meet. Despite the win, 
Michigan had small mistakes and 
bobbles, particularly on beam, 
that need attention — not a single 
Wolverine scored a 9.900 or 
higher during that event.

“This was a great result with 

a win against a tremendous 
program, but we also came away 
with a lot of things we need to 
work on,” Plocki said. “I think 
they know that, they understand 
that, and we’re ready to go back in 
the gym Monday and get to work.”

Individuals shine 
in Wolverine win 

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

In a meet against the No. 9 

team in the country, the Michigan 
women’s gymnastics team needed 
to be especially sharp at Crisler 
Center on Saturday to earn an 
impressive win.

Led by five athletes who either 

tied or set new career highs in the 
meet, the fifth-ranked Wolverines 
narrowly defeated No. 9 Georgia, 
196.925-195.200. 

After missing all of last season 

due to injury, sophomore Lauren 
Marinez surpassed her personal 
record on the beam with a 9.775, 
beating her score of 9.750, which 
she set just last weekend.

Senior 
Briley 
Casanova 

scored a 9.900 on the floor event, 
her highest since her freshman 
year, which came as a surprise 
even to her.

Michigan practiced few special 

dance moves, though Casanova 
explained the importance of a 
drill she and her teammates call 
“shoot ’em downs.”

“(It’s a drill in which) we 

just try make eye contact with 
everyone on our team on the 
floor whenever we do a dance 
through,” Casanova said. “We 
really emphasized that.”

Freshman Emma McLean also 

tied a career high. She received 
a 9.850 in the floor event, living 
up to the promise she’s showed 
as a newcomer. Last weekend at 
the meet in Cancun, Mexico, she 
scored a 9.775. 

Sophomore 
Nichelle 

Christopherson, who performed 
in just four routines last season, 
significantly improved from her 
showing on the uneven bars in 
the previous meet. There, she 
scored a 9.100 after being added 
to the rotation at the last minute. 
Saturday, she scored a 9.825, 
tying her best score ever, which 
she set last January.

Junior Talia Chiarelli, who 

finished in the top three for each 
event in which she competed, 
explained 
what 
individual 

successes can mean for the team.

“It’s awesome,” Chiarelli said. 

“It’s even more awesome to do 
that in one of the first meets of 
the season.”

Another freshman who has 

excited both her teammates and 
coaches is Olivia Karas. Karas 
set a new best in the floor event 
in her young career, scoring a 
meet-high 9.950. However, she 
also struggled at times during the 
meet, falling on both the beam 
and the uneven bars.

“(Karas) is absolutely capable 

of making a name for herself 
in 
college 
gymnastics,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 
Bev 
Plocki. 

“When she learns how to control 
her nerves and emotions and go 
out there and really perform, that’s 
when she’s going to be at her best.”

Karas scored a meet-low 8.850 

on the uneven bars due to falling 
in the middle of her routine.

Luckily for her, her teammates 

stepped up, with junior Nicole 
Artz and sophomore Brianna 
Brown scoring in the top three.

Plocki attributed the players’ 

individual successes to the facility 
at Crisler and to the coaching staff.

“That’s what we want to do, 

to develop these young ladies,” 
Plocki said. “It’s nice from a 
coaching perspective to see the 
fruits of your labor come out and 
show season best scores.”

Despite many players setting or 

tying career-high scores, Plocki 
stressed the importance of the 
entire team’s success in addition 
to that of the individual athletes.

“If we had a lot of people who 

had a lot of great individual 
accolades, but the team lost, it 
would be a disappointing night no 
matter what any individual did,” 
Plocki said. “The team result is 
the reason we do this.”

Michigan uses non-scoring 
meet as early-season gauge

By TOR THORNE 

For the Daily

The Michigan men’s track 

and field team returned to action 
for the first time this year at 
the Hillsdale Winter Opener on 
Saturday in Hillsdale, Mich. With 
just 11 Wolverines competing in 
the day’s events, the unscored 
meet provided little information 
about the team as a whole. But 
Michigan coach Jerry Clayton 
said the meet still held value.

“This weekend was basically 

about the individuals who wanted 
to try to see where they’re at at 
this point,” Clayton said.

The Wolverines found the 

majority of their success Saturday 
in field events, taking first place in 
shot put and the top three spots in 
the weight throw.

For senior shot putter Derek 

Sievers, whose 18.42 meter throw 
earned him first place in the event 
and an early season personal 
best, this meet will serve as an 
important 
stepping 
stone 
to 

improve upon for the remainder 

of the season.

“It’s always easier to compete 

in practice the next week when 
you’ve had a good performance,” 
Sievers said. “Because you just 
keep the momentum going.”

Michigan redshirt freshman 

Joseph Ellis took first place in 
the weight throw with a throw 
of 18.96 meters, earning his first 
event title as a member of the 
Wolverines.

Redshirt 
sophomore 
Grant 

Cartwright and fifth-year senior 
Brad Bolton added second- and 
third-place finishes with throws 
of 18.52 meters and 17.00 meters, 
respectively.

Clayton 
was 
also 
pleased 

with the performance of the 
pole vault group, which had two 
members finish in the top five. 
Junior Michael Hovater took 
fourth place, trailed directly by 
redshirt freshman Kevin Haughn 
in fifth. True freshman Nicholas 
Burkhalter finished in 11th place 
with a height of 4.35 meters.

Sophomore Charlie DeJonge 

was the only athlete to represent 

the 
Wolverines 
in 
multiple 

events Saturday, finishing the 
60-meter hurdles in 8.73 seconds 
to take fourth place. DeJonge 
also competed in the shot put, 
finishing 13th, but setting a new 
personal best of 11.45 meters.

In high jump, senior Stephen 

Sykes cleared 1.90 meters and 
finished third overall. Meanwhile, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Kevin 

Stephens Jr. finished fourth in the 
long jump with a distance of 6.53 
meters.

While Saturday’s meet was an 

important test for its competitors, 
Clayton emphasized the even 
greater importance that each 
athlete’s performance would have 
on his coaching moving forward.

“(The race) gives me ideas of 

what I need to do training-wise 
to make adjustments so that we 
can get through this month of 
January and come out really 
ready to roll in February when we 
get to the championship phase,” 
Clayton said. “The bigger test will 
be when we have 90 percent of the 
team open up next weekend.”

Wolverines shake off rust 
at Hillsdale Winter meet

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

For the Daily

Balance — that’s what Michigan 

women’s track and field coach 
James Henry is trying to achieve 
this season. With 16 top-three 
finishes in 11 different events, the 
14th-ranked Wolverines appear 
to be on their way to achieving 
Henry’s goal.

“It’s hard for me to talk about 

one or two athletes and say, ‘She’s 
the person that just did it,’ ’’ Henry 
said. “I’m pleased to know that we 
don’t have such a program where 
one athlete ‘just does it.’ ”

Michigan opened its season 

Saturday at the Hillsdale Winter 
Opener, 
a 
non-scoring 
meet 

featuring a variety of Division 
II teams. Setting official times 
for the first time this season, the 
Wolverines created a benchmark 
to improve upon for the rest of the 
season.

Michigan 
wasn’t 
focusing 

on beating any times going into 

the meet, though. Rather, the 
Wolverines’ focus was beating 
the competition and shaking off 
the early-season rust that many of 
the student-athletes had. In doing 
so, Michigan was able to take 
home first place in eight different 
events.

Though some of the track and 

field team members have already 
competed this year as part of 
the cross country team, most of 
the Michigan runners have been 
waiting since September to finally 
race.

As balanced as Michigan’s 

roster was, there were a few 
standout performances for the 
Wolverines. 
Sophomore 
Claire 

Kieffer-Wright, who also is a 
member of the Michigan volleyball 
team, won the high jump with a 
final cleared height of 1.74 meters, 
while junior All-American Erin 
Finn won the 3,000-meter run by 
more than 30 seconds with a final 
time of 9:13.41.

In addition, redshirt senior 

All-American 
Shannon 
Osika 

turned in a strong performance 
in the 1600-meter, winning the 
event with a time of 4:42.10. Osika 
was also part of an experienced 
Michigan 4x400 relay team, which 
also 
included 
redshirt 
senior 

Laura Addison, redshirt junior 
Gina McNamara, and redshirt 
senior Danielle Pfeifer. The group 
narrowly edged out Hillsdale for 
another Wolverine victory.

The most important result of 

the meet, though, was something 
that didn’t happen.

“The kids came out unscathed,” 

Henry said. “We got solid marks 
and we’re all healthy.”

Now that Michigan knows its 

starting point, the team is aware 
of where it can finish.

“Being in a position to win a 

championship and finishing in 
the top three,” Henry said. “That’s 
our team goal, and if things go 
to our favor, we’re hoping to be 
in the position to improve upon 
those two goals.”

Michigan opens 
series with rout 
in East Lansing

Wolverines knock 
out Hildebrand in 
second period after 

seven goals

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

EAST LANSING — If it wasn’t 

already clear this season, the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team 
can 

score goals.

Friday, the Wolverine offense 

exploded once again in a win 
over Michigan State (1-4-0 Big 
Ten, 5-14-2 overall) by a score of 
9-2 at Munn Ice Arena.

“It’s obviously nice when you 

beat State,” said junior forward 
JT Compher. “The offense was 
going today, which it has been 
most of the year.”

It didn’t start out well for 

the Wolverines (3-1-1, 12-3-3), 
though.

The Spartans put the first 

point on the scoreboard 9:26 
into the first period. Michigan 
State defenseman John Draeger 
found forward 
Mason 
Appleton 
alone 
inside 

the left faceoff 
circle 
and 

made 
the 

cross-ice pass. 
Appleton 
took the one-
timer off the 
shot, 
which 

ricocheted off 
a skate past senior goaltender 
Steve Racine for the freshman’s 
fourth tally of the season.

But as Michigan has done 

many times already this season, 
the Wolverines came right back, 
pouncing on a Spartan mistake 
less than three minutes later. 
Compher collected the puck off 
a Michigan State miscue and put 
the puck upstairs past Spartan 
goaltender Jake Hildebrand.

“(Junior 
forward 
Tyler 

Motte) did a great job keeping 
the puck in,” Compher said. “I 
was able to have a two-on-one 
with (freshman forward Kyle 
Connor), and saw (Hildebrand) 
creeping a little bit and put it 
over his shoulder.”

The Wolverines weren’t done, 

though — not by a long shot.

Fifty-seven 
seconds 
after 

Compher’s goal, with Michigan 
State forward Ryan Keller in 
the box less than 10 seconds, 
Michigan scored again.

A tic-tac-toe play saw senior 

forwards 
Boo 
Nieves 
and 

Justin Selman pass the puck 
before 
sophomore 
forward 

Tony Calderone finished off the 
play, one-timing the puck past 
Hildebrand.

And just 18 seconds later, 

junior forward Alex Kile found 

himself alone just outside the 
left faceoff circle and hit twine.

After Michigan State came 

back with a power-play goal 
of its own, Michigan cruised. 
Freshman forward Kyle Connor 
tallied his team-leading 13th goal 
of the season, and sophomore 
forward Dexter Dancs added his 
own to close out the scoring in 
the first period. 

While the second featured 

much less scoring, Michigan 
tallied each goal.

On the power play, junior 

forward Alex Kile found a 
trailing sophomore defenseman 
Zach 
Werenski, 
who 
had 

returned two days prior from 
captaining the U.S Junior Team 
at the World Championships, 
wide open in the slot. Werenski 
gathered the puck and buried it 
past Hildebrand.

Another Michigan goal from 

Connor was all Michigan State 
coach Tom Anastos needed to 
see to pull Hildebrand, the 2015 
Big Ten Player and Goaltender 
of the Year.

“You know you have to move 

(Hildebrand) 
side 
to 
side,” 

Compher said. “You have to try 
to beat him up top. You got to try 

get people to 
the net.”

Compher 

and 
Motte 

scored in the 
third 
period 

to round out 
the 
game’s 

scoring. Their 
line, 
which 

also includes 
Connor, 
finished 
the 

game with five goals and 13 
points.

“JT and Tyler have played 

solid all year,” said Michigan 
coach 
Red 
Berenson. 
“And 

with this kid (Connor) on the 
left wing, he just adds another 
dimension.

“It’s 
been 
good. 
They’ve 

been moving the puck, they’re 
working 
hard 
and 
they’re 

leaders. They’re a big part of our 
team.”

In net, Racine continued his 

run of good play since coming 
back from injury, stopping 24 
shots for his third straight win.

“(Racine’s) goals against are 

two a night,” Berenson said. 
“He’s made some good saves. 
Now, he’s only played three 
games in a row so I can’t tell you 
this is a trend, but good for him.”

It’s no surprise that Michigan 

can score goals. What the 
Wolverines 
have 
lacked, 

though, is consistency. After 
scoring seven and eight goals 
on Dartmouth and Minnesota, 
respectively, Michigan could 
muster just one and two goals 
the following nights.

So the real question for the 

Wolverines is: Can they come 
back and score nine goals 
tomorrow night?

‘M’ seeks scoring answer

Wolverines struggle 

to score against 
Purdue’s tough 

inside-outside ‘D’

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

Purdue coach Matt Painter 

waited eight minutes before 
sending Michigan’s nightmare 
onto the court: two men who, 
stacked one atop the other, 
would weigh 532 pounds and 
stand an inch shy of 14 feet tall.

Caleb Swanigan, at 6-foot-

9 and 250 pounds, was more 
physically 
imposing 
than 

anybody on Michigan’s roster. 
Isaac Haas, at 7-foot-2 and 282 
pounds, was just there as a 
redundancy measure.

With 
Michigan 
junior 

forward Zak Irvin, 35 pounds 
lighter and three inches shorter 
than 
Swanigan, 
and 
junior 

forward 
Mark 
Donnal, 
42 

pounds lighter and five inches 
shorter than Haas, attempting 
to guard them, respectively, 
the result was a predictable 
dismantling. 
The 
Wolverines 

(2-1 Big Ten, 12-4 overall) were 
eaten alive Thursday in their 
87-70 loss, the fourth time this 
season they have crumbled in 
the face of larger opposition.

“Post defense is something 

that you try and work at,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“But when you play the best in 
the country at post offense, it’s an 
eye-opener. That didn’t help us.”

Irvin’s defensive play against 

Swanigan, as it turned out, was 
one of Michigan’s best individual 
efforts of the evening. However, 
the image of Irvin, known 
principally as a shooter and 
undersized as a power forward, 
that remained was him getting 
physical in the post with a 250-
pound freshman.

Swanigan 
and 
Haas 

combined for 10 points and 14 

rebounds, and the Boilermakers 
outperformed Michigan on the 
defensive glass, 30-19. Purdue’s 
other 7-footer, A.J. Hammons, 
did even more damage, scoring 
17 points and recording four 
thunderous blocks.

“You can run some cute stuff 

and get right to the rim, and 
somebody’s sending you back,” 
Beilein said. “It really deflates you.”

Outgunned inside, Michigan’s 

only option was to win from 
behind the 3-point arc, a task made 
considerably more difficult by 
the absence of senior guard Caris 
LeVert, who missed his second 
consecutive game with a leg injury.

Redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 

Duncan Robinson, who ranks 
fifth nationally in 3-point shooting 
percentage, was healthy. But 
with the defensive blanketing he 
received from Purdue’s Rapheal 
Davis, he might as well have been 
on the bench as well.

Davis, one of the country’s 

elite 
defenders, 
stuck 
to 

Robinson 
like 
ice 
on 
an 

unshoveled Ann Arbor sidewalk, 
holding him to five attempts 
from beyond the arc, two of 
which were desperation heaves 

with the shot clock winding 
down. Robinson did what he 
could, impressively nailing a 
transition 3 with a shooting 
motion that began before he 
landed in his preferred spot on 
the right wing. But his 10 points 
weren’t enough, especially with 
Irvin shooting a frigid 2-for-10 
from the field.

“(Davis) is a really good 

defender,” 
Robinson 
said, 

offering little else by way of 
explanation. 
“That 
poses 
a 

challenge for us.”

With 
Michigan’s 
shooters 

either injured, locked down 
or unable to find twine, the 
outside game turned to two of 
the Wolverines’ own big men: 
Donnal and redshirt freshman 
D.J. Wilson, who combined to 
shoot 3-for-7 from 3-point range.

That was in line with the 

game plan, Beilein said. If the 
Wolverines could make one-
third of their 3-point attempts, 
the 
strategy 
would 
prove 

a 
bargain 
against 
Purdue’s 

defensive efficiency rating of 
83.6 points per 100 possessions, 
which leads the nation. The 
hope was for Michigan’s bigs 

to attempt between five and 10 
shots from that range.

Wilson had attempted just 

13 3-pointers this season before 
Thursday, 
the 
majority 
of 

which came in garbage time 
against markedly inferior non-
conference 
opponents. 
He 

attempted five from beyond the 
arc Thursday, making only one. 
Donnal fared better, draining 
both of his attempts.

“Those guys, they can make 

’em in practice,” Beilein said. 
“They’ve got to make them, 
obviously, at Mackey Arena, in 
front of a crowd.”

The formula could be one 

Michigan turns to more often, 
especially 
if 
size 
continues 

to 
limit 
the 
Wolverines’ 

inside presence and if a single 
perimeter defender like Davis 
can 
wreak 
havoc 
on 
their 

traditional, guard-based outside 
game. Even against Purdue’s 
impressive perimeter defense, 
Wilson 
and 
Donnal 
were 

reliably open from straightaway 
after 
early-possession 
ball 

screens. Whether that pair can 
consistently shoot 3-for-7 is a 
different discussion.

Wolverines win 
second straight

Michigan holds 

off late Minnesota 

rally for win

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Minnesota 
women’s 

basketball team nearly created 
déjà vu for Michigan on Sunday 
afternoon.

At 
one 

point 
in 

the 
first 

quarter, Michigan led by 17 — 
the same deficit it overcame 
Thursday in a comeback against 
Iowa. Minnesota chipped away 
at the Wolverines’ early lead, but 
it could not catch up late.

Sophomore guard Katelynn 

Flaherty iced the game from the 
free-throw line, and Michigan 
(2-2 Big Ten, 10-5 overall) came 
out on top, 93-86.

The Gophers (2-2, 10-5) face-

guarded Flaherty, even away 
from the ball, but Michigan’s 
leading scorer shot 9-for-14 to 
earn 33 points.

Flaherty, who averaged 21.2 

points before Sunday, passed 
that mark midway through the 
third quarter.

The Wolverines’ win moves 

them to .500 in conference play 
after they opened the Big Ten 
season with devastating back-to-
back losses to Purdue and Indiana.

What they couldn’t do against 

either 
of 
those 
opponents, 

though, was jump ahead early, 
but Sunday they had no trouble 
lighting up the field from the 
opening tip. Michigan scored 
35 points in the first quarter, 
leaving its coach amazed.

“I didn’t know we could score 

35 points,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico in an interview 
with MGoBlue after the game. 
“To do that in one quarter, that’s 
pretty incredible.”

Michigan 
embarrassed 

the Gophers’ defense in the 
first quarter. During the first 

10 minutes, the Wolverines 
built up a 17-point lead and 
outrebounded Minnesota, 14-5. 
Seven of those 14 rebounds were 
offensive rebounds.

“(Minnesota) has only been 

outrebounded one time this year, 
and really that was our number-
one goal today — to outrebound 
them,” Barnes Arico said. “We 
did a terrific job. They had a lot 
of long shots down the stretch, 
and we had to battle, and we had 
to fight, and we missed a couple 
long ones in the end, but we did a 
great job on the boards.”

Sophomore 
guard 
Jillian 

Dunston led the team with 15 
rebounds, an impressive showing 
in just 22 minutes off the bench. 
She averaged 5.7 rebounds before 
the contest. Dunston was also 
one bucket away from a double-
double, scoring eight points.

Aided by Dunston’s ferocity 

on the boards, Michigan won 
the rebounding battle, 46-33.

Dunston was not alone in 

the race for the double-double, 
though, as junior guard Siera 
Thompson (18 points, eight 
assists), senior forward Kelsey 
Mitchell 
(13 
points, 
nine 

rebounds) and freshman center 
Hallie Thome (16 points, eight 
rebounds) were all knocking on 
the door of the feat.

Three Gophers scored 20-plus 

points 
to 
help 
Minnesota 

creep back into the game, but 
the 
Wolverines’ 
consistency 

from the free-throw line kept 
stretching the lead.

Michigan is now 9-0 this season 

when scoring at least 80 points.

Consecutive 
wins 
after 

consecutive losses brought out 
the Wolverines’ strengths and 
weaknesses. Two games saw 
Michigan fail to convert free 
throws and struggle to score in 
the paint. Two others featured 
the 
Wolverines 
lighting 
up 

opponents from beyond the arc 
and dominating on the glass.

Sunday, Michigan was the 

latter, and Minnesota’s time 
ran out.

‘M’ beats Buckeyes

Michigan rallies 

again with 12 

unanswered points

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

Even though the No. 13 

Michigan 
wrestling 
team 

defeated No. 6 Ohio State, 21-11 
on Saturday, there was a time 
when 
things 
appeared 
to 
be 

trending the Buckeyes’ way.

In 
the 
165-pound 
class, 

Wolverine sophomore Garrett 
Sutton was dominated by the 
Buckeyes’ second-ranked Bo 
Jordan, 19-4. Jordan won by 15 
points, earning the Buckeyes 
five team points and giving 
them an 11-9 lead with No. 19 
redshirt 
freshman 
Davonte 

Mahomes 
of 
Michigan 

scheduled 
to 
take 
on 

No. 15 Myles 
Martin.

Mahomes 

turned 
the 

tide. Trailing 
1-0 with 1:30 
to go in the 
third period, Mahomes nabbed 
an escape point to send the bout 
into overtime. The sudden-death 
extra frame didn’t last long.

Mahomes was awarded a 

takedown 13 seconds into the 
period to earn a 3-1 victory, 
which 
put 
the 
Wolverines 

ahead, 12-11.

“Mahomes is really tough,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Joe 

McFarland. “It was a great win 
for us and for him, and it put the 
momentum on our side.”

It was all Michigan from 

there. After a scoreless first 
period, No. 10 junior Domenic 
Abounader took total control 
of the 184-pound match to 
top No. 12 Kenny Courts, 5-0. 
Abounader accumulated 3:16 of 
riding time in the process.

It was fifth-year senior Max 

Huntley, though, who clinched 
the meet for the Wolverines. 

He defeated Mark Martin, 8-3, 
in the 197-pound class, giving 
Michigan an insurmountable 
18-11 edge and a signature 
road victory.

Junior heavyweight Adam 

Coon put the icing on the cake 
as he scored a win over Nick 
Tavanello, 4-1.

“It was a great team effort,” 

McFarland said. “We got our 
offense going, and I think that 
is important.”

Added Mahomes: “I feel like 

the team performed at a very high 
level. We were all fired up and 
ready to go. It was really awesome 
to get to experience a dual meet of 
this caliber with so much heat and 
tension against each other.”

Yet, what was arguably the 

Wolverines’ most impressive 
individual victory came in the 
133-pound class.

In a match that many picked 

to end in favor of Ohio State, No. 
16 senior Rossi Bruno notched 

two 
escape 

points 
and 

2:09 of riding 
time to upset 
No. 8 Johnni 
DiJulius, 4-1.

Bruno’s 

win 
knotted 

up the score 
at three, as it 
came on the 

heels of a close loss by No. 19 
redshirt junior Conor Youtsey 
at the hands of No. 1 Nathan 
Tomasello, 4-2, in the 125-
pound match.

“Even though he didn’t win, 

I thought (Youtsey) controlled 
most of his match,” Bruno 
said. “That really helped me 
out with my match in terms of 
getting momentum.”

While Michigan is riding 

high following its triumph 
over the defending national 
champion, 
the 
Wolverines 

will not have much time to 
celebrate. They will have to 
face No. 11 Illinois at Cliff Keen 
Arena on Jan. 15.

“We 
have 
to 
keep 
an 

aggressive mindset,” McFarland 
said. “If we go out there, 
concentrate and focus on our 
execution, the wins will take 
care of themselves.”
