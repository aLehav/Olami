Michigan Senate bills 152 

and 153 and House Bill 4190 
make up a recent bipartisan 
legislative 
initiative 
that 

seeks to offer more support to 
sexual assault survirors.

The 
senate 
bills 
were 

co-sponsored by Sens. Tonya 
Schuitmaker 
(R–Lawton) 

and Rebekah Warren (D–
Ann Arbor), and the house 
bill was sponsored by Rep. 
Laura 
Cox 
(R–Livonia). 

Collectively, the legislation 
will create consistency in the 
way health care providers are 
compensated for their support 
of sexual assault survivors, 

allow 
courts 
to 
consider 

a suspect or perpetrators’ 
history of sexual assault prior 
to the case at hand and support 
medical providers that aid 
sexual assault survivors with 
increased reimbursements.

Schuitmaker 
said 
the 

legislation was brought to the 
Michigan state government 
by the Michigan Domestic and 
Sexual Violence Prevention 
and Treatment Board, which 
forced holes in current sexual 
assault support law.

“Because 
victims 
of 

sexual assault may or may 
not want to cooperate with 
law enforcement, this bill 
clarifies the prompt reporting 
requirement,” 
Schuitmaker 

The 
National 
Academy 

of 
Engineers 
named 
two 

University of Michigan faculty 
to its ranks last Monday. 
Mechanical 
Engineering 

Prof. Ellen Arruda, and Mark 
Daskin, professor and chair 
of Industrial and Operations 
Engineering, were selected 
by the NAE in one of the 
highest possible professional 
distinctions for engineers.

Candidates’ 
selection 

is based on broad factors, 
specifically 
involvement 

in and contributions to the 
engineering 
community, 

according 
to 
the 
NAE 

website. The award also seeks 
individuals in the engineering 
field developing “innovative 
approaches” to education.

Arruda and Daskin will join 

the approximately 21 other 
engineering professors at the 
University who are part of 
the NAE. Arruda is the only 
woman on the list.

The 
Academy 
applauded 

Arruda 
for 
her 
research 

on 
polymer 
and 
tissue 

mechanics and her ability to 
use her findings in real-world 
products. Arruda is currently 
working 
on 
developing 
a 

shock-absorbing helmet that 
uses polymer structures to 
more evenly distribute the 
blow when there is an accident 
affecting the brain.

She is also researching the 

soft tissues in knees to do 
simulations to try to improve 
knee repair surgery after an 
injury such as an ACL tear. 

“The simulations tell us 

things about how you might 
alter the stresses or strains 
that you put on the knee after 
ACL replacement or how you 
might design a better graft if 
you tear your ACL,” she said.

For Arruda, being named 

to the NAE is especially 

important, as she knows that 
her 
peers 
and 
colleagues 

nominated and voted for her.

“It’s 
an 
incredibly 

exciting honor, it’s almost 
overwhelming,” she said. “It’s 
always rewarding when you 
get an award that is the result 
of several of your peers voting 
for you, and in this case it’s a 
large group of people voting on 
this process so it’s rewarding 
and humbling to know that 

a lot of my peers thought to 
recognize me.” 

Daskin, an editor for the 

Institute of Industrial and 
Systems 
Engineers, 
was 

commended for his creative 
work on location optimization 
and its relevance in industrial, 
service 
and 
medical 

systems. He also studies the 
effectiveness of supply chain 
design 
and 
the 
problems 

The first episode of “The Next 

Four Years,” a web series created 
by University of Michigan alum 
Nick 
Blaemire, 
was 
released 

Wednesday on the web series’ 
website, 
thenextfouryearsshow.

com. The series will comprise 
eight episodes, which will all be 
released online.

The show follows Ana and 

Phil, two recent college graduates 
attempting to make sense of their 
newly discovered reality. The first 
episode centers on the struggle of 
finding work after graduation—
particularly after majoring in a 
field based on passion rather than 
practicality.

Blaemire 
said 
he 
was 

enthusiastic to do a show about the 
job market and these post-college 
years when it was pitched to him 
because he knew exactly what the 
state of limbo felt like.

“Millennials think that there 

will be work for them just because 
you’re raised to believe that you 
can have or do anything you want, 
and that altruism that our parents 
give us is incredible, but it creates 
a very strange disconnect after you

When University of Michigan 

alum Patton Doyle, co-founder 
of Decode Detroit, opened his 
first escape room in Ann Arbor 
last October, he knew it was 
one unlike the rest. Doyle took 
his passion and knowledge of 
puzzles to create escape rooms 
as a tool for urban planning in 
Ann Arbor and Detroit.

“I started Decode Detroit 

because I was trying to come 
up with a way that we could 
take our knowledge of puzzles 
and 
escaping 
and 
creating 

fun games, and putting that 
into a way to use as an urban 
planning 
tool,” 
Doyle 
said. 

“(We’re) binding together areas 
of southeast Michigan as a 
single sort of urban unit. Retail 
is suffering in the age of the 
internet. So, we’re trying to use 
this trend (of escape rooms) to 
promote local tourism.”

Nothing says Valentine’s Day 
like heart eyes emoji and MoJo 
Cookies.

When the temperatures were 

higher than normal in January, 

many believed the weather would 

get back to normal soon. 

Winter months at the 

University of Michigan normally 

consist of below-freezing 

temperatures and a lot of snow. 

But here, in the middle of 

February, some might say Spring 

Break has arrived early.

Many students have expressed 

their appreciation of the sunny 

days. The Michigan Students 

account wrote on Twitter, “Ann 

Arbor’s sunshine and clear, blue 

skies is making me feel all kinds of 

happy today!”

Despite a positive reaction to 

the warmth, a new study led by 

Ian Winkelstern, a postdoctoral 

researcher in the Department 

of Earth and Environmental 

Sciences at the University, found 

this latest warming to be harmful 

to rising sea levels.

The last time it was this 

warm, cold water that had melted 

from Greenland’s ice sheets was 

flowing as far down the Atlantic 

Ocean as Bermuda, altering the 

ecosystem and changing the 

ocean’s climate. Winkelstern 

told the Michigan News this 

could destroy the coral reefs of 

Bermuda, flood North America 

and cause Europe’s temperature 

to drop.

“If a big enough chunk of 

Greenland falls off, which has 

clearly happened in the past and 

has clearly caused these dramatic 

changes in the past, there’s no 

reason to think it couldn’t happen 

again,” Winkelstern told the 

Michigan News. “We’re doing a 

pretty good job of melting it right 

now.”

Regardless of whether this 

warm-up is from the effects of 

climate change, get ready for the 

warm days and sunny skies to 

continue this weekend and next 

week.

Members 
of 
eMerge, 
a 

student-run 
political 
party 

campaigning 
for 
Central 

Student Government, kicked 
its campaign off with a meet-
and-greet 
for 
interested 

students to learn more about 
the party’s core team members 
and platform.

eMerge’s core team took 

input 
from 
University 
of 

Michigan 
students 
about 

the 
goals 
of 
their 
party. 

Vice-presidential 
candidate 

Nadine 
Jawad, 
a 
Public 

Policy 
junior, 
and 
other 

candidates 
spoke 
with 

students about opportunities 
to run as a representative 
for the party, join the street 
team to campaign, or aid in 
coordinating 
events 
with 

other organizations.

“Today is an opportunity 

for students to learn about 
what we are trying to do and 
how they can get involved,” 
Jawad said. “We want to 
create a student government 
that allows students to emerge 
out of the crowd and into 
leadership roles.”

According 
to 
eMerge’s 

presidential candidate, LSA 
junior 
Anushka 
Sarkar, 
a 

main focus of the platform is 
breaking down the barriers 
that prevent students from 
becoming 
involved 
with 

student government.

“The purpose of eMerge is 

to create an organization that 
empowers students to rise up 
and be involved in issues and 
initiatives on campus that 
they’re passionate about or 
that affect them,” Sarkar said. 
“We see CSG as a platform for 

students to be involved in the 
things that they care about.”

eMerge 
has 
broken 
up 

its platform into advocacy 
plans and initiative plans. 
Initiative plans focus on easily 
completed projects such as 
extended 
campus 
Wi-Fi, 

improved bathroom facilities, 
and the installation of game-
day hydration stations.

Their 
advocacy 
plans 

focus 
on 
long-term 
goals 

such as expanding in-state 
tuition 
to 
undocumented 

and non-traditional students 
and 
improved 
testing 

accommodation centers.

LSA junior Ryan Dishell 

attended the meet-and-greet 
to determine how he wanted 
to involve himself in CSG.

“I 
like 
that 
they 
have 

short-term goals and long-
term goals; I think it’s really 
important for a platform to 

have a vision, but to also 
have a plan and tangible 
goals that students can get 
done,” Dishell said.

After leaving the meet-

and-greet, 
LSA 
junior 

Kyla Klein said the party 
appeared to bring a new 
perspective to CSG.

“I was really interested 

in their stance on students 
with Medicaid using the 
services 
at 
Michigan,” 

Klein said. “I found their 
campaign really interesting 
and unique.”

Kinesiology 
sophomore 

Okpalefe Edevbie expressed 
similar views on the party’s 
platform. 

“I think they’ve a lot of 

great plans to reach the 
different facets and groups 
in student government, and 
to create more access for 
students,” Edevbie said.

Currently, 
eMerge 
is 

running unopposed for the 
election on the March 22 
and 23.

said. “During prosecuting, it 
allows for all evidence to be 
used against a defendant.”

The Board said it was happy 

with 
the 
new 
legislation 

because it more effectively 
aids sexual assault victims 
within the criminal justice 
system, should they choose 
to prosecute the perpetrator. 
Schuitmaker 
said 
that 
the 

legislation will likely provide 
security to college students 
who seek action through the 
criminal justice system.

“Senator Warren and I have 

been co-chairs on the first 
ladies task force in regards to 
sexual assault on campuses,” 
Schuitmaker said.

The 
future 
of 
federal 

enforcement 
of 
sexual 

assault 
laws 
under 
Title 

IX 
remains 
unclear. 
In 

confirmation hearings, new 
Education 
Secretary 
Betsy 

DeVos’ 
commitment 
to 

continuing sexual misconduct 
investigations 
remained 

ambiguous. 

Kinesiology 
junior 
Laura 

Marsh, 
vice 
chair 
of 
the 

University’s chapter of College 
Democrats, 
expressed 
her 

support for the bills and said 
that on college campuses, the 
issue of sexual assault is not 
discussed enough, which is 
why widespread legislation on 
the issue is necessary.

“There’s not enough done 

to stop it, so I’m really glad 
Senator Warren is looking 
out for her constituents on 
this,” Marsh said. “Because a 
lot of them are female college 
students who are going to 
be positively affected by the 
resources 
these 
bills 
will 

provide 
to 
sexual 
assault 

survivors.”

The 
University’s 
chapter 

of College Republicans was 
unavailable for comment. 

Kinesiology 
junior 
Cass 

Bouse-Eaton is a director of 
the sexual violence branch of 

the Panhellenic Peer Educator 
Program, 
which 
aims 
to 

spread awareness and create 
a support system within the 
Greek 
life 
community 
for 

women struggling with sexual 
misconduct that is perpetrated 
by the school’s Greek life 
culture.

Bouse-Eaton too supports 

the 
new 
legislation, 
and 

said 
governmental 
support 

for victims is a step in the 
right 
direction, 
especially 

given new challenges posed 
by our current presidential 
administration. 
However, 

she also highlighted inherent 
flaws 
within 
the 
system 

that legislation has yet to 
address, specifically on college 
campuses.

“We have such low rates 

of 
these 
crimes 
actually 

being reported, but also even 
getting to court,” she said. 
“And in court, the odds that 
a perpetrator will ever see a 
day in jail are so small. So, 
if this legislation allows for 
something 
that’s 
happened 

in the past to be brought 
up in court, that’s fabulous. 
But it also assumes that that 
something has already been 
brought up in the past.”

Bouse-Eaton 
also 
said 

combatting sexual violence, 
harassment 
and 
assault 

begins with the community 
on campus, and solidarity is 
not always legislative. Rather, 
recognizing 
institutional 

problems and pledging support 
for victims of assault culture 
are essential to decreasing the 
problem on campus.

“I feel like, as women, 

we have a lot more power 
than we think we do in this 
situation,” she said. “We talk 
a lot about fraternity houses 
and 
fraternity 
parties. 
If 

something like this happens 
to one of our sisters at a house, 
we’re not going there anymore. 
We’re not feeding this culture 
at this house. And fraternity 
parties, whether we realize it 
are not, are upheld by female 
attendance. We don’t invest in 
things we don’t believe in.”

LEGISLATION
From Page 1A

must work through a fantasy 
world and “work together to 
save humanity.” Doyle said 
what makes his escape room 
unique is the story, which 
centers around Minerva, an 
artificial 
intelligence 
whom 

participants can either team up 
with or work against.

“Every escape room is a 

unique experience,” Doyle said. 
“The way that I would describe 
ours 
is a puzzle-adventure 

where you and a group of up to 
10 friends have to solve a series 
of puzzles to advance the story 
and get out of the room. It’s like 
being dropped into the middle 
of the climax of an artificial-
intelligence movie, and you 
happen to be there when things 
go wrong.”

After playing part one in 

the escape room, part two 
of the story takes players to 
about 15 Ann Arbor stores to 
solve a scavenger hunt. Doyle 
hopes to have more than 30 
stores 
participating 
by 
the 

end of the summer, creating 
an intellectual challenge that 
focuses on the storyline in 
order to engage players even 
after they play part one.

“Ann Arbor is a wonderful 

town,” Doyle said. “Being from 
Ann Arbor, I’ve found that I 
know a lot of the shopkeepers 
who we’re partnering with to 
post these puzzles around the 
city.”

Doyle said he wants to use 

the puzzles and games around 
Ann Arbor and Detroit to help 
revitalize urban areas. He is 
trying to get people to go to 
shops and stores they might 
not normally visit and increase 
urban tourism as best he can.

“The thing that I’m most 

excited about that we’re doing 
right now is we’re opening a 
series of puzzles around Ann 

Arbor, and soon Detroit, that 
are free to play,” Doyle said, 
“that are introducing people 
to unique places — unique, 
locally-owned shops — that 
people might not otherwise 
discover. What we’re trying 
to do is use this escape room 
trend as something that can be 
a positive force for tourism for 
downtown areas in Michigan.”

Engineering 
freshman 

Kaelan 
Oldani 
worked 
at 

Decode 
Detroit 
over 
the 

summer and developed one of 
the puzzles for the scavenger 
hunt in Ann Arbor. Oldani said 
every puzzle takes particular 
attention to detail.

“Patton knew I was about 

to begin my first year as an 
engineering 
student 
at 
the 

University, and was willing 
to give me the opportunity to 
get a head start with hands-
on 
experience 
through 
his 

company,” Oldani said. “So 
much thought and planning 
went into every single detail of 
the puzzle room.”

Rackham student Meghan 

Clark, chair of the CS KickStart 
program, brought her group of 
undergraduate mentees from 
CS 
KickStart 
through 
the 

escape room last fall.

“Around the time we were 

organizing 
our 
fall 
social 

event for alumni, we got an 
email from Decode Detroit 
describing their escape room,” 
Clark said. “It sounded like a 
fun, computer-themed outing, 
which was exactly what we 
were looking for.”

Clark said Doyle gave her 

group a behind-the-scenes tour 
of how things worked, which 
she said was a valuable way 
to learn more about computer 
science.

“(This) was very educational 

for them as budding computer 
scientists,” Clark said. “Seeing 
how computers were used to 
create the awesome experience 
they just had made computer 

science look cool.”

Not yet complete, part three 

of the Minerva Project will take 
players back to the escape room 
with new puzzles, in order to 
finish the adventure. Doyle said 
this is significant because, for 
most users, escape rooms are a 
one-time thing.

“They (escape rooms) don’t 

have much replayability,” Doyle 
said. “We’re building what is 
effectively two escape rooms in 
one location.”

Additionally, the co-founders 

wish to open a second escape 
room in the New Center area 
of Detroit, with hopes of taking 
what they have now in Ann 
Arbor and replicating it in 
another city. The location will 
be connected to the midtown 
and 
downtown 
corridors 

through the QLine light rail, 
which will help them in having 
puzzles throughout the city.

“The goal is to harness this 

game and these creative ideas to 
help the ongoing revitalization 
of southeast Michigan,” Doyle 
said. “We have one and a half 
(escape rooms). We have one 
that’s fully operational, and one 
in Detroit that’s in progress. 
We’re working to turn that into 
something that can be used as 
an escape room, either indoor 
or outdoor.”

Doyle said many students, 

young 
professionals 
and 

families have come to their 
escape room, with 55 percent of 
groups “escaping”—winning—
part one.

“One of the first groups 

we had was a student group,” 
Doyle said. “They still to-date 
my favorite group that went 
through. The students that 
come through really seem to 
enjoy it. The entire game isn’t 
open yet, but plenty of players 
have 
beaten 
what’s 
been 

released. Some people really 
enjoy the puzzling part of it, 
some people are more there for 
the story.”

Oldani said the escape room 

could have a big impact on the 
region, and would recommend 
University 
students 
go 
try 

to solve the escape room for 
themselves. 

“It’s 
impressive 
to 
see 

the company grow from a 
mere passion for puzzles and 
interest in escape rooms into a 
successful company spanning 
across the region,” Oldani said. 
“It’s a local escape room right 
off of campus, and is tons of fun. 
Regardless of how clever you 
think you are, this escape room 
will be an exciting challenge.”

In a broader scope, Doyle 

said 
the 
games 
serve 
to 

bind together urban areas, 
especially in an era where 
retail has been suffering in the 
Internet age. Clark added she 
is looking forward to playing 
part two in Ann Arbor in the 
near future.

“I’m really excited about 

the new stage of puzzles that 
Decode Detroit just released, 
where 
you 
walk 
around 

downtown Ann Arbor solving 
clues 
and 
find 
out 
what 

happens to Minerva,” Clark 
said. “I haven’t done it yet, 
but I can’t wait to see what 
happens next in the story.”

Though 
Doyle 
doesn’t 

know how long this trend will 
last, he is looking forward to 
giving users an experience 
they will want to continue. 
Furthermore, 
he 
hopes 
to 

work with the creative culture 
movement in Detroit.

“Our long-term goal is to 

turn this not into just an escape 
room,” Doyle said. “We want 
it to be something that’s more 
of a community of puzzlers, of 
game-designers, who create 
games that are physical in 
nature. 
Doing 
the 
puzzles 

around the city has brought 
people to us. This is different. 
It is clearly no longer just an 
escape room. I hope this lasts 
for 10 to 20 years.”

were 
consistent 
with 
City 

finance records.

“I 
received 
the 
e-mail 

below from Ms. Lesko late 
yesterday afternoon, and the 
request from Mr. Eaton this 
afternoon,” Lazarus wrote to 
the City Council members on 
Saturday. “Kindly note that I 
have asked Purchasing staff 
to inquire into the means by 
which the contracts with the 
organizations cited have been 
awarded. We will also look 
at the dates of service of the 
individuals 
identified 
with 

the dates of award. Finally, 
this provides an opportunity 
to review and validate our 
contracting procedures with 
regard to conflicts of interest.”

In an email to the Daily on 

Monday, Lazarus confirmed 
an internal investigation had 
been initiated, and it would 
determine whether any ethics 
rules were violated. He said 
the 
investigation 
will 
also 

review the city’s contracting 
process.

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski (D–Ward 5) said 
it would be premature to 
conclude ethical rules had been 
violated before the internal 
review is completed.

“On the one hand, we want 

to take the concern seriously, 
on the other hand we also don’t 
want to assume malintent until 
it’s been found,” Warpehoski 
said. 
“(But) 
I’ve 
seen 
no 

evidence of impropriety.”

Eaton echoed Warpehoski 

and 
added 
that 
the 

investigation would provide 
an opportunity to examine the 
consistency and oversight of 
the city’s contracting process.

“Part of the review Mr. 

Lazarus has requested will 
be a review of contracting 
procedures,” Eaton wrote in an 
email to the Daily. “If we find 
our policies to be deficient, we 
will take steps to address those 
deficiencies. Council member 
(Sumi) 
Kailasapathy 
(D–

Ward 1) and I are discussing 
an 
ordinance 
that 
would 

address the ethical standards 
for members of boards and 
commissions.”

Ann 
Arbor 
residents 

have 
raised 
allegations 

that 
several 
prominent 

members of the Downtown 
Development 
Authority, 

Planning 
Commission, 

Local Development Finance 
Authority 
and 
Public 
Art 

Commission 
have 
been 

benefitting from approximately 
$1.33 million worth of city 
contracts. According to Lesko, 
the 
city’s 
finance 
records 

reflect 
that 
once 
certain 

members were appointed to 

their respective boards and 
commissions, the companies 
they own or work for began 
obtaining city contracts they 
had not received prior.

Following resident concerns, 

Lesko began to investigate 
on the city’s website. All the 
city’s vendor contract records 
are available to the public 
through A2OpenBook. Lesko 
sifted through contracts filed 
between 2010 and 2016, first 
looking solely at McWilliams’ 
media agency Q+M, formerly 
Quack!Media.

Lesko argued there needs 

to be more oversight on city 
contracts that involve city-
affiliated personnel to prevent 
conflict-of-interest cases.

“What I’ve said to Mr. 

Lazarus 
in 
my 
email 
is 

that they need to do some 
investigating going back at 
that case, so that the public 
knows over the last ten years 
how much money total in 
city contracts … have gone to 
city board and commission 
members,” Lesko said. “I think 
every time something comes to 
City Council where city staff 
are recommending a former 
city staff member or a current 
board or commission member 
or their employer, Council 
must be told in public.”

Warpehoski 
noted 
that, 

though 
stringent 
oversight 

is 
necessary, 
having 
local 

business leaders on city boards 
and commissions can have a 
positive impact.

“I don’t think we should have 

a policy where the only way to 
serve on a board or commission 
is to give up your hope of being 
able to do any business with the 
city or the DDA or the AAATA,” 
Warpehoski said. “I want our 
local 
units 
of 
government 

supporting local businesses. 
I want local business leaders 
sharing their expertise of local 
government and contributing 
in that way. But I don’t think 
that should give anybody any 
special treatment.”

According to Lesko, just 10 

percent of the contracts were 
above 
the 
threshold 
price 

of $25,000 that would have 
required a City Council vote. 
City Administrator Lazarus 
has the discretion to award 
contracts under the $25,000 
threshold.

In 
many 
cases, 
the 

council 
looks 
to 
insight 

from 
appropriate 
boards 

and 
commissions 
for 

recommendations on contracts.

“More 
frequently, 
staff 

will seek input from a board 
or 
commission 
during 
the 

development of a statement of 
work prior to commencement of 
the formal solicitation process 
to help define an approach to 
achieve a City goal,” Lazarus 
wrote in an email.

get into the real world,” Blaemire 
said. “After the incubation of 
college, you’re suddenly dealing 
with a very real drought of the 
dreams that we all think are going 
to happen for ourselves.”

When asked about the next 

four years after college, University 
students 
tend 
to 
share 
this 

sentiment 
of 
uncertainty 
and 

stress. For years, LSA sophomore 
Camille Phaneuf had one word to 
describe that period: uncertain. 

“Anxiety,” 
Phaneuf 
said. 

“There’s so much uncertainty, and 
I don’t really know what I’m doing.”

While some people, like LSA 

freshman Lily Barash, are excited 
for their four years of college 
because it means independence 
and 
freedom 
from 
parental 

supervision and the pressures 

of school, stress and anxiety 
are common sentiments about 
this time. Kinesiology freshman 
Sydney Grant was most nervous 
about the lack of a clear path.

“You need to make decisions 

fast compared to going from high 
school to college, which is like a 
common thing where everyone 
mostly knows that’s what’s next,” 
Grant said. “But after college, 
people go to grad school, they 
travel, they get a job, and you need 
to make these decisions quickly.”

Blaemire says he definitely 

related 
to 
these 
feelings 
of 

uncertainty himself after leaving 
the University, but says college 
prepared him as well is it could for 
these strange years.

“I think I got an incredible 

amount 
of 
information 
from 

Michigan that has totally shaped 
me as a person, and I think that 
the world is changing too fast for 
any one form of education to really 
fully prepare you; the experience 

of being introduced to (the real 
world) is sort of like the fifth year 
of college,” Blaemire said. “I look at 
the world through the lens of the 
way I took in information about 
Michigan, only now I’m sort of 
creating my own school and my 
own projects at home.”

“The Next Four Years” is 

Blaemire’s first venture into the 
web-series format. While Blaemire 
has used many platforms for his 
art, including musicals and TV, 
he says there is value in the more 
recently popularized web series 
format.

“I love it,” Blaemire said. “I 

think there’s a lot to be said for the 
proliferation of ways you can tell 
stories, and I think that there’s a 
freedom in a web series that you 
don’t have in a long-form narrative, 
because you can tell as much of the 
story as you want and whatever 
part of the story you want, and 
in a way it becomes more like a 
snapshot than like a fully rendered 

narrative.”

Blaemire 
said 
that 
this 

“snapshot” way of telling stories 
allowed him not only to tell 
more stories, but gave him the 
opportunity to use his script and 
camera angles as a way of telling 
the story as well, a sort of second 
layer to his storytelling.

“Where you put the camera and 

what part of the story you decide 
to script can tell so much more 
than what’s actually happening, 
and it can reverberate into other 
characters’ arcs,” he said. “You can 
really create this interesting web of 
stories that you’re kind of telling by 
juxtaposing against others. You’re 
sort of shadow-telling more stories 
than just the foreground.”

One shadow story Blaemire 

identified was that of the current 
presidential administration — not 
a surprising one, given the name of 
the series. While Blaemire and the 
other creators did not intend for 
the title to have a double meaning, 

Blaemire thinks it fits in with the 
themes of the series.

“It sort of nails a theme that the 

show really has, which is like when 
we’ve been learning our whole 
lives in four-year chunks, from first 
to fifth grade, and then high school 
and college, we’re sort of built in 
this four-year mentality, and part 
of that is the presidency,” Blaemire 
said.

Blaemire didn’t seem to mind 

the connotation the title might have 
with the current president, calling 
it “unavoidable,” but also noted 
that having the president as one 
of these aforementioned “shadow 
characters” is rather fitting.

“While we don’t speak about 

politics really in it — it’s much more 
about young people trying to make 
their own way — they’re still trying 
to make their own way in America, 
and so I do think that in a way he 
becomes a shadow character in the 
same way that there are many more 
stories than the one that we’re 

telling, that resonate because we’re 
pointing the camera at this real 
chasm between the reality that we 
thought existed in college and the 
reality that actually exists in the 
real world, and since reality is quite 
the buzzword these days, it only 
helps the story resonate more.”

Reflecting on his college years, 

Blaemire has one simple piece 
of advice for current University 
students.

“Read,” Blaemire said. “Read 

about what’s happening in the 
world. Pay attention. And find that 
beautiful balance between being in 
this incredible incubation chamber 
surrounded by a bunch of other 
vivid, smart, attractive people, 
and then also know that you live 
in the world as well, and how do 
you balance against having this 
idealized college experience while 
also slowly but surely becoming 
a citizen of the planet and taking 
advantage of that town and that 
state and that part of the country.”

Daskin works with students 

to use optimization in other 
contexts, such as understanding 
the causes of drug shortages 
in the US or how to maximize 
diversity within groups in his 
classes.

Daskin 
views 
the 
honor 

as a way to give back to the 
engineering community.

“I 
also 
think 
it’s 
an 

opportunity for service,” he 
said. “I believe the National 
Academy of Engineering is 
called on for various studies 
when people in the government 
want to do so, so it’s an 
opportunity for service.”

Arruda is also excited for 

the opportunity to serve the 
engineering 
community, 

specifically 
women 
and 

underrepresented 
minorities, 

through her membership in 
NAE.

“I want to learn more about 

what opportunities there are 
to work with members of the 
academy,” she said.

Arruda 
and 
Daskin 
are 

two of 106 new members of 
the NAE. This year’s new 
membership 
will 
up 
the 

American membership to 2,281 
and international membership 
to 249.

The two, who will be formally 

inducted into the NAE in 
Washington D.C. on Oct. 8, are 
among the Leaders and the Best 
at the University, according 
to Alec Gallimore, dean of 
engineering and professor of 
aerospace engineering, in a 
Michigan News article.

“This 
signature 

accomplishment 
by 
these 

esteemed 
faculty 
members 

represents 
the 
leadership 

and excellence we value at 
Michigan 
Engineering,” 
he 

said.

Arruda looks forward to 

working with the NAE, and she 
is thankful for her peers that 
nominated her.

“It seems that a good deal of 

people work hard to make these 
nominations possible, and it’s a 
lot of work to nominate a peer 
and get them to the point that 
they get elected, so I would like 
to express gratitude to those 
anonymous people out there 
who made this happen for me,” 
she said.

magine sitting in lecture. 
Your professor is doing 
his job, going through the 

slides as usual, when a student 
decides to stand up, point at 
the professor, and yell: “You 
suck, bitch! And your mother 
thinks you suck! And you’re an 
asshole, prick, bitch, whore!” 
Now imagine all 300 people in 
the lecture decide to join in, and 
everyone is suddenly pointing and 
chanting insults at the professor.

Depending on how boring 

your lectures are, maybe you’ve 
had this impulse before. But 
nonetheless, you don’t do it and 
this never happens, because the 
idea of randomly going up to 
somebody and verbally degrading 
him or her with personal insults 
and obscenities is ridiculous.

Yet, there’s one place in our 

society where such behavior 
becomes the norm. In this 
place, there is an unspoken 
consensus 
that 
our 
normal 

social conscience no longer 
applies. Suddenly, the otherwise 
unthinkable becomes routine, 
and the otherwise despicable 
becomes encouraged. This is the 
strange essence of the “student 
section” — a staple of America’s 
strong and obsessive college 
sports culture. Our sports culture 
at the University of Michigan is 
not an exception to this rule.

For two seasons, I worked 

with 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball team as a student 
manager and a walk-on practice 
player. For three seasons, I’ve 
been a Michigan football season 
ticket holder. I’ve been to a lot 
of games, and every time I walk 
into one, I feel a sense of awe 
as I am reminded of the size 
and power of our community. 
When we all sing “Hail to the 
Victors,” I feel pride, and when 
we finally get the wave started 
around Michigan Stadium, I 
feel connected. But every game, 
there are several times when I 
feel disenchanted, and I marvel 
at 
the 
absurdity 
of 
what’s 

happening around me.

Whenever 
the 
Michigan 

football team forces a punt, 

the student section performs 
something called the “You Suck” 
chant. While the band plays 
“Temptation,” everyone in the 
student section motions their 
arms back and forth toward 
the quarterback and yells, “You 
suck … you suck … you suck,” 
until the chant crescendos and 
concludes with an emphatic, 
“You suck, bitch!”

Every time, I stand there 

in 
amazement 
and 
watch 

thousands of intelligent people 
simultaneously scream at the 
quarterback and call him a bitch 
on a campus that denounces 
sexist language. What’s more is 
that nobody seems to question it. 
When I look around the student 
section, I am hard-pressed to 
find anybody who isn’t happily 
reveling in the chant, following 
along with the rest of the pack.

Sometimes when the opposing 

team’s running back gets the 
ball, I’ll hear a student near me 
yell something like “Kill him!” 
or “F--- him up!” Again, this is 
seen as tolerable in the college 
football environment despite the 
fact that dozens of former players 
have died from chronic traumatic 
encephalopathy, 
which 
they 

develop by sustaining big hits in 
football games. A brutal hit could 
actually kill them or contribute 
to something that eventually 
kills them, but it doesn’t seem 
to matter to that student, who, 
in this context, is allowed to say 
whatever they want.

I’ve only been to one hockey 

game at Yost Ice Arena, but 
the fan culture there seems 
even more extreme than it is at 
football games. One of the most 
notorious traditions at Yost is the 
“C-Ya Cheer.” When an opposing 
player enters the penalty box, the 
student section yells “C-Ya,” and 
then follows it up with a montage 
of 
vulgarity, 
which 
includes 

“chump,” “douchebag,” “asshole,” 
“cheater,” “prick,” “bitch” and 
“whore,” all conveniently packed 
into one crude chant.

Another Yost tradition occurs 

when the phone rings in the press 
box. When this happens, the 

crowd will chant: “Hey (insert 
goalie’s name), it’s your mom! She 
says you suck!” This chant (like 
all chants) seems harmless to 
anybody in the student section, 
and it probably is. But then again, 
maybe it isn’t. Just ask Steve Kerr, 
a former University of Arizona 
point guard, who received taunts 
about his father — an American 
professor who was assassinated 
by terrorists overseas. Certainly 
these taunts were more directly 
and intentionally offensive, but 
this is what a mob mentality in 
the stands can lead to. 

I’m all for harmless taunts, 

resonant 
booing 
and 
getting 

inside the opponent’s head. All 
of this adds to the dramatic and 
thrilling atmosphere of a college 
sporting event, while providing an 
emotional release for the fans. But 
there is a fine line between playful 
heckling and senseless verbal 
abuse. Making fun of a player for 
an air ball or a whiff is harmless 
taunting. Degrading an athlete on 
a personal level is senseless verbal 
abuse, and targeting someone with 
mindless obscenities (in a family 
atmosphere) is inexcusable, no 
matter the context.

There is no other place on a 

college campus where calling 
someone a bitch is encouraged. 
It is not OK anywhere else in 
society to yell “Kill him!” or “F--- 
him up!” to somebody. Why are 
sporting events different?

Using sports to lower our 

standards is lazy, and using 
opposing players as outlets for 
our pathetic fan catharsis is 
ugly. We can come together to 
support our team, but we can 
do so without losing a basic 
standard of human respect for 
the opponent. 

Don’t fall under the spell of a 

mob mentality. If you disagree 
with the premise of a chant, resist 
it, and then maybe even think 
of something better. I’d bet that 
whatever you come up with is at 
least a level up from “You Suck.”

M

ake America Great 
Again” was President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

slogan, 
which 

resonated 
with 
so 

many this past fall, 
and 
was, 
in 
part, 

his 
justification 

for 
signing 
seven 

executive orders and 
11 memos during his 
first couple of weeks 
in office. Making the 
United 
States 
safe 

was 
the 
objective 

behind 
his 
recent 

executive order to temporarily 
block immigration from seven 
countries previously identified by 
former President Barack Obama 
and Congress as dangerous places 
for which reliable vetting was not 
possible. 

The 
messages 
surrounding 

the order, and the process by 
which it was rolled out, however, 
overshadowed 
its 
objective. 

So too did Trump’s tweet that 
the opinion from a “so-called 
judge” to grant a temporary 
restraining order was ridiculous 
and dangerous. Indeed, many of 
his tweets play into a growing 
narrative that he is defensive, 
sophomoric and careless.

On Meet the Press, Danielle 

Pletka of the American Enterprise 
Institute downplayed the impact of 
a contentious phone conversation 
with Australia’s prime minister 
over an agreement by Obama to 
accept more than 1,000 refugees 
from Australia annually. Pletka, 
who is of Australian descent, 
acknowledged that Trump may 
have been justified in questioning 
the merits of the deal, but he 
needs 
to 
rethink 
how 
he’s 

handling it. Indeed, he seems to 
underestimate the importance 
of process and underappreciate 
the 
public 
outrage 
that 
his 

words evokes in the absence of 
appropriate context.

For example, in a pre-Super 

Bowl interview, Fox’s Bill O’Reilly 
asked Trump if he respected 
Putin and Trump replied, “I do 
respect him.” When O’Reilly said 
Putin is a “killer,” Trump said: 
“We’ve got a lot of killers. What, 
do you think our country’s so 
innocent?” This statement, of 
course, led to significant outrage, 
and prompted Chuck Todd, host 
of Meet the Press, to allege that 
Trump 
was 
asserting 
moral 

equivalency between the United 
States and Russia.

When it comes to executing 

his vision and enacting change, 
Trump clearly does not appreciate 
that style, rather than merely 
substance, is important. While 
content is critical, so too is how 
he communicates his message. He 
may substantively be advancing 

an agenda that he was elected to 
execute, but the process by which 
he moves forward — including 

the 
conditions 

surrounding 
its 

execution — should 
be communicated in 
a way that not only 
satisfies his base, but 
attempts to mollify his 
adversaries.

Though 
it 
was 

pleasant to see a room 
filled 
with 
support 

when Neil Gorsuch 
was nominated for the 

Supreme Court, the rubber meets 
the road when Trump’s messages 
reach those who did not vote for 
him and who are unlikely to set 
aside his words and lack of style in 
the short term, simply in hope that 
he may deliver results in the long 
term. Speaker of the House Paul 
Ryan, in an interview with Chuck 
Todd, minimized the impact of 
Trump’s style, and suggested 
that polarization and division in 
the United States will diminish 
as results from Trump’s policies 
improve the economy.

While Trump’s approval may 

increase over time, only Trump 
himself can expedite the process 
by revising his style and caring 
more about the “how” of delivering 
his messages. Peggy Noonan, in a 
recent article titled “In Trump’s 
Washington, 
Nothing 
Feels 

Stable,” recommends, “You have 
to help your allies in the agencies 
and on the Hill know, understand 
and be able to defend what you’re 
doing.” I would add that Trump 
also needs to help the American 
public better understand the 
substance of his plans before he 
rolls things out too hastily. He is 
the commander in chief, and may 
have the ultimate say on certain 
matters, but getting buy-in, at the 
very least, may require a modicum 
of dialogue and explanation. We 
need to appreciate his optics and 
trust that the process is legitimate 
— that he avails himself of his 
advisers and appreciates both 
the upsides and downsides of 
his decisions.

In 
my 
estimation, 
Trump 

would be well advised to limit his 
tweets to statements of fact rather 
than speculation or derision. It’s 
not enough that those who voted 
for him might appreciate his 
intent. He must be deliberately 
concerned with how those who 
did not vote for him appreciate his 
tweets. Furthermore, tweeting 
cannot provide the necessary 
context — the optics — to ensure 
clarity. Where emotions run 
strong and the stakes are high, 
dialogue is the only way to deal 
with difference of opinion. Such 
crucial conversations need to 
be authentic, measured, honest 

and bi-directional. In this light, 
Twitter is not the venue, nor are 
diatribes by designees such as 
Sean Spicer or Kellyanne Conway.

Further, Trump and his team 

must 
refrain 
from 
reporting 

alternative facts. In the event 
that they do, however, as was 
the case recently when Conway 
erroneously referred to a massacre 
in Bowling Green to defend the 
immigrant ban, they must recant 
publicly and accept accountability 
for misreporting. Going forward, 
Trump himself needs to regularly 
meet with the press and present 
himself with equanimity and 
empathy. If he has any hope of, 
or interest in, changing his image 
among naysayers, he must accept 
that his actions create his reality. 

In 
an 
interview 
this 

past 
weekend 
with 
George 

Stephanopoulos on “This Week,” 
Stephen Miller ultimately pushed 
the Trump administration in 
the right direction. Miller, a 
senior policy adviser to Trump, 
displayed great composure in 
the face of a heated exchange. 
When 
probing 
questions 

outreached his jurisdiction, he 
cautiously referred to another, 
more appropriate member of 
the administration. Though his 
authoritative stance may have 
been perceived as yet more 
“Trump-like” 
authoritarianism, 

from my perspective, it was 
clear and far from overstated, 
despite Stephanopoulos’ repeated 
attempts 
to 
provoke 
him. 

However, when discussing the 
notion of voter fraud, Miller 
continuously equivocated. By 
making 
assertions 
without 

providing 
cogent 
supporting 

evidence, 
he 
provided 
yet 

another example of what Trump 
must avoid.

To 
truly 
get 
more 
done 

than what was achieved over 
the last eight years, Trump 
needs to present himself not 
as an autocratic leader, but as 
a 
collaborative, 
emotionally 

intelligent one. He needs to 
actively solicit feedback from 
his 
close 
advisers 
regarding 

how effective or ineffective his 
messaging might be. When given 
new information, he needs to 
pivot, adjust and recant as needed. 
These are just the beginning steps 
to establishing trust with the 
electorate.

As has been said before in one 

form or another, he may go more 
quickly alone, but he will go further 
together. Making America great 
again will require a presidential 
leader who appreciates how critical 
the process of leadership is.

The ends don’t mitigate the means

NICHOLAS TOMAINO | COLUMN

Our fandom is not an excuse

JON RUBENSTEIN | OP-ED

Jon Rubenstein is 

an LSA junior.

at ntomaino@umich.edu.

I

’ll admit something that I 
don’t usually say about my 
student representatives in 

Central 
Student 
Government. 

I was pleasantly surprised and 
excited when I first heard about 
the 
Leadership 
Engagement 

Scholarship that was started in 
the fall semester. As someone 
who is very involved on campus, 
I am more than familiar with 
the struggles of running from 
meeting to meeting with little 
break, and am even more familiar 
with the frequent choice between 
being involved on campus and 
working to make ends meet. This 
scholarship would really help 
someone like me, who feels the 
need to work their way through 
college as their parents did, but 
also wants to be involved in 
organizations on campus that 
supplement learning.

My 
excitement 
about 
the 

scholarship is what led me to 
be sorely disappointed to read 
that CSG would charge students 
$5 a semester to endow the 
scholarship. This regressive tax 
on students will harm those who 
need it the most. By choosing 
to charge a fee, CSG has taken 
the easy route to funding this 
scholarship, rather than internal 
budgeting or external fundraising. 
CSG has violated its core mission 
to represent the interests of all 
students, and in doing so has 
raised the cost of attendance at the 
University of Michigan — limiting 
the ability of its constituents to 
attend and thrive in college.

While CSG acts as if this 

fee 
is 
inconsequential, 
the 

reality of a $40 charge over an 
undergraduate’s career at the 
University will disproportionately 
affect 
lower-income 
students, 

especially those who are taking 
loans and will pay interest on the 
fees down the road. According 
to a survey conducted by CSG, 
75 percent of its members come 
from families making more than 
$100,000 a year and thus will 
never be able to understand the 
full impact of their fee increases. 
Though this resolution passed 
nearly unanimously, the voices 
of lower-income students — who 
these fees will affect most — were 
omitted.

Opposition to this fee was 

best summarized by Rackham 
Rep. Andy Snow, who said the 
tax points out the hypocrisy of 
CSG representatives saying, “I 
don’t see fundamentally how so 
many of us can be against tuition 
hikes and increases and still be in 
support of this.” A regressive tax 
on students who most need the 
scholarship won’t do anything to 
confront the increasing costs of 
higher education. Additionally, on 
Thursday, Regent Andrea Fischer-
Newman tweeted that she would 
not be in support of a raise in fees 
to fund the LES.

What’s more alarming is that 

the scholarship is skewed in 
favor of well-endowed student 
organizations that do not need 
financial support from CSG. The 
scholarship could be a wonderful 
opportunity to push CSG funding 
to financially struggling student 

organizations. 
Instead, 
the 

scholarship will prioritize students 
who will not be able to participate 
in student organizations without 
funding help. While this sounds 
like a good thing on the surface, 
prioritizing 
“pay 
to 
play” 

organizations such as Greek life 
and club sports does not work 
to solve the underlying issues 
of socioeconomic diversity and 
the high cost of college that have 
prevented students from joining 
student organizations in the past. 
The University was recently rated 
the least socioeconomically diverse 
public university in the nation, and 
that designation won’t go away by 
raising the cost of attendance in 
favor of the 10 to 15 chosen students 
who receive the LES scholarship.

While 
CSG 
decries 
tuition 

increases and tries to make the 
cost of school lower through 
various resolutions, it seems to 
have no problem raising fees for 
a scholarship that doesn’t seem 
worth it. I am opposed to the $5 
fee, and I urge CSG and the Board 
of Regents to do everything in their 
power to keep the costs of higher 
education low by repealing the fee 
and confronting the increasing 
costs of higher education across 
the board. For CSG to use the term 
“tool of equity” to describe this 
scholarship, it must come from 
a place that legitimately helps 
students of a lower socioeconomic 
status thrive at the University. 

Abolish the $5 fee

‘M’ set to face Indiana

The No. 20 Michigan women’s 

basketball team needs just two 
more wins to record its best season 
in program history, but those hopes 
will face a stiff challenge in the 
form of a contest with Indiana at 
Assembly Hall on Thursday night.

The 
Wolverines 
(10-2 
Big 

Ten, 21-5 overall) last took on 
the Hoosiers (7-5, 17-8) on Jan. 
10, and managed to come away 
with a victory — barely. Despite 
Michigan’s 64-55 lead going into the 
fourth quarter, Indiana narrowed 
its deficit to two points in the final 
minute. But senior guard Siera 
Thompson iced the game, making 
four free throws in that final minute 
to claim the 78-74 win.

Four Hoosiers scored in double 

digits in the previous matchup — 
guard Tyra Buss and center Jenn 
Anderson both tallied 21 points. 
Michigan has the capability to 
match that output, though, as 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty, 
sophomore center Hallie Thome 
and 
freshman 
guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick have all scored over 20 
points in multiple games.

The 
Wolverines’ 
previous 

victory may foreshadow success 
in their upcoming matchup, but 
Michigan has taken care to not be 
overconfident. 

“Indiana is a great team, and 

it came down to the wire here,” 
Flaherty said. “Going to their place, 
it’s going to be much different, and 
they will have a better game plan to 
try and stop us.”

The Wolverines faced another 

Big Ten team for the second time 
last Sunday and learned that initial 
wins don’t equate to easy rematches. 
On Jan. 1, Michigan easily defeated 
Wisconsin, 73-56, but when the two 
teams played again on Feb. 12, the 
Wolverines’ lead often remained in 
single-digit range.

“They played a lot of (man-on-

man defense),” Flaherty said. “And 
I think that was a different look for 

us than last time, when they played 
a lot of zone.”

With more time to refine their 

game plan, the Badgers provided 
more of a challenge to Michigan 
the second time around. Wisconsin 
held Thome to just 13 points — a 
steep drop-off from the 37 she 
scored in the first matchup.

Against Indiana, Michigan is 

eager for the opportunity to correct 
its mistakes. The Wolverines have 
been averaging 71.5 percent from 
the free-throw line this season, but 
they have struggled in their past 
three games. Michigan managed 
to shoot just 54.5 percent against 
Wisconsin, 46.2 percent against 
Purdue and 57.7 percent against 
Iowa from the charity stripe.

“We just need to capitalize on all 

the little things,” said sophomore 
guard Nicole Munger. “… That’s 
definitely controllable, and it puts us 
up 10 more points, and it gives us a 
little bit more breathing room.”

The Wolverines are also putting 

an emphasis on rebounding after 
the Hoosiers won the battle on the 
glass, 35-29, in the previous game.

“If 
you 
are 
going 
to 
get 

outrebounded, 
you 
can’t 
get 

outrebounded and then give away 
possessions on the offensive end,” 
Barnes Arico said. “So we really 
talked about taking care of the 
basketball.”

Despite focusing on its problem 

areas, Michigan has the weapons 
to top Indiana on the road, from 
its high-volume scorers — Thome, 
Flaherty, and Gondrezick — to its 
strong defenders — Thompson and 
junior forward Jillian Dunston. 
Munger has also made a strong 
impact off the bench recently with 
a combination of press defense and 
late threes.

Riding 
a 
six-game 
winning 

streak and falling to an unranked 
team only once this season, the 
Wolverines have the momentum 
to match their goal of finishing 
top-three in the Big Ten, and that 
energy will likely carry them 
against Indiana.

Michigan looks ahead to rematch

Two seems to be Michigan’s 

unlucky number heading into its 
matchup with Wisconsin. 

Michigan coach John Beilein 

has beaten the Badgers just twice 
in 18 attempts as a head coach, 
and the Wolverines have yet to put 
together a winning streak of more 
than two games so far in Big Ten 
play this season.

Michigan will have a chance to 

break both trends Thursday when 
Wisconsin (10-2 Big Ten, 21-4 
overall) pays a visit to Crisler Center 
for the Wolverines’ penultimate 
home game of the season.

Compared 
to 
last 
month’s 

contest in Madison — a 68-64 
Badger victory — Michigan (6-6, 
16-9) now has a better feeling 
heading into the rematch.

The Wolverines are coming off 

their best defensive performance 
of the conference season, holding 
Indiana to 63 points and 21 percent 
shooting from three on its home 
court.

Leading 
that 
effort 
was 

Michigan’s frontcourt duo, redshirt 
sophomore forward DJ Wilson 
and sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner., led that effort. The pair 
shut down Hoosier center Thomas 
Bryant and forced Indiana to make 
plays on the perimeter rather than 
work the ball inside-out.

The Badgers play a similar style 

of working through forward Ethan 
Happ, who leads the team in points, 
rebounds and assists. Though 
Wilson had success stopping the 

forward in the first half of the game 
in Madison, he quickly picked up 
three fouls shortly after halftime 
while defending Happ’s frontcourt 
partner — forward Nigel Hayes — 
and had to watch from the bench 
as Happ’s passing skills powered 
Wisconsin on a decisive 15-0 run.

Wilson 
and 
Wagner’s 
foul 

trouble in that matchup paralyzed 
the Wolverines down the stretch. 
The Badgers were in the bonus for 
a majority of the second half, and 
Michigan lost its physical edge and 
height advantage.

“Wisconsin’s really good at 

drawing fouls,” Beilein said. “(We) 
have to learn to play post defense 
aggressive. I’m not talking about 
not fouling; I’m talking about bad 
fouls. They’ve got to be good fouls 
in the post because if you’re going 
to be physical, you’re going to be 
called for something.”

The Wolverines’ defense showed 

they were capable of holding Happ 
and Hayes below their respective 
scoring averages, especially when 
they focused on creating turnovers 
or forcing difficult shots. At the 
Kohl Center, Happ went 5-for-13 
from the field and committed three 
turnovers while Hayes shot 4-for-
11 from the floor and 1-for-4 from 
behind the arc.

“We got to have a lot of ideas in 

our head, and hopefully we’re good 
at all of them and not average,” 
Beilein said on trying to contain 
Happ and Hayes. “Trying to put 
it all together, it’s going to be a 
challenge because they’re a very 
smart team. We’re not going to 
surprise them, but hopefully we 

can create some turnovers or create 
some tough twos for them to make 
as well.”

Wisconsin 
guard 
Bronson 

Koenig, who played a central role 
in the Badgers’ win in January, 
has been deemed questionable for 
Thursday’s game. Koenig has been 
held out of practice for the past two 
days, and is listed as day-to-day 
with a leg injury.

The senior was a non-factor for 

35 minutes, but single-handedly led 
Wisconsin in the final five minutes.

Senior guard Derrick Walton 

Jr. took responsibility for Koenig’s 
run and now revels in the chance to 
prove his defensive worth over the 
fellow senior point guard.

“If you’re a good player and 

you make one shot, that’s all the 
difference,” Walton said. “Kudos 
for him for not being frustrated for 
35 minutes and doing what his team 
needed him to do and close out the 
game. I take a personal challenge 
on playing a full 40 minutes of 
playing great defense on him.”

Michigan will be familiar with 

the matchups it will face against 
the Badgers on Thursday. Where 
the Wolverines fall short, though, 
is knowing how to handle their 
recent success.

Following previous two-game 

stretches of victories this season, 
Michigan has gone on to drop the 
following game of each string.

Now, with wins over Michigan 

State and at Indiana, Michigan 
faces the same challenge to bottle 
its momentum and extend its 
winning streak.

“It’s normal as a human when 

you have some success, you relish 
in it and get comfortable,” Walton 
said. “Only the great individual 
teams and coaches push you to 
be better. I think that falls on the 
players and the leadership.”

Added Beilein: “With most 

people, good is the enemy of great. 
As soon as you do some things 
good, you start to slack off a little 
bit. That’s our job as coaches to 
make sure they see that.”

If the Wolverines want to reach 

their goals and land comfortably 
in the NCAA Tournament field, 
they can’t let an opportunity like 
Thursday night pass them by.

In Madison, Michigan proved 

it has the matchups and the talent 
to beat the Badgers. Now, the 
Wolverines have to show they have 
developed the mental edge to get 
over the hump and beat the streaks 
that will continue to haunt them if 
they don’t.

Notebook: LaFontaine in, Kile out

A bang-bang play knocked 

goaltender Jack LaFontaine out of 
the Michigan hockey team’s game 
against Michigan State this past 
Saturday. 

During a Michigan State attack, 

sophomore defenseman Nicholas 
Boka was pushed into the crease 
and fell on the freshman, who 
appeared to suffer a leg injury 
that left him in considerable pain. 
LaFontaine attempted to play on it, 
but it wasn’t long before Michigan 
coach Red Berenson decided to 
pull him for senior goaltender Zach 
Nagelvoort.

LaFontaine 
described 
the 

sequence of events as “frustrating.” 
He had worked hard in practice all 
week to earn the starting spot in 
Saturday’s game against Michigan 
State, marking just his second start 
since Dec. 2, and had been playing 
well before the injury, stopping 18 
of 19 shots in the contest.

Despite 
the 
shortened 

appearance, 
LaFontaine 
has 

maintained his position in the 
current 
goalie 
competition 

between him, Nagelvoort and 
freshman Hayden Lavigne (who 
has received the most starts). 
The injury didn’t last beyond the 
weekend, allowing him to practice 
all this week, and according to 
Berenson, LaFontaine is “back in 
the picture” as the team continues 
his search for a starting goaltender.

“We 
liked 
(LaFontaine’s) 

progress in practice and his work 
ethic,” Berenson said. “It’s getting 
to the point where you’d like to see 
one goalie take it and run with it, 
and we haven’t had one goalie that 
really has stood out. 

“They’ve all had their moments. 

… There’s no blueprint that you can 
just go by and say, ‘This is the plan,’ 
and expect everything to work 
perfectly. It hasn’t. But all three are 
working hard, they all want to play, 
and they’re all getting chances to 
play. But whoever takes it and runs 
with it will be that guy, if anyone 
does. Otherwise we’re going to be 
a team with goalie by committee.”

Added 
LaFontaine: 
“It’s 

definitely a great opportunity for 
me individually. As a team, I have 
the ability to kinda get us out of 
this hole. I think as a three-man 
rotation, we do a really good job of 
staying in games and making big 
saves. … We’re just working hard 
and doing what we’ve done since 
the beginning of the season.”

Warren, 
Dancs 
switching 

lines

In Michigan’s last four games, 

sophomore 
forward 
Brendan 

Warren has played on the same line 
as freshmen forwards Jake Slaker 
and Will Lockwood. But that will 
change against Wisconsin this 
weekend.

“We gotta get more guys going, 

and I think Brendan can add more 
to our team than he has, and I think 
Dexter Dancs can add more to our 
team than he has,” Berenson said.

Dancs has shifted to the Slaker-

Lockwood line, where he’ll play 
with the team’s two leading 
scorers. Meanwhile, Warren has 
moved to the fourth line, alongside 
junior forward Cutler Martin and 
freshman forward Nick Pastujov. 
He will be playing right wing in 
place of freshman Steven Merl, 
who isn’t traveling with the team. 

“Brendan Warren is doing a 

good job on the penalty kill, and I 
want to see him kick in offensively 
when he can,” Berenson said. “Our 
fourth line has been outscored 
way too often this year, including 
against Wisconsin. So hopefully 
it’ll be stronger this weekend than 
it has been.”

Warren doesn’t think there will 

be too much of an adjustment from 
switching lines — he skated with 
Martin and Pastujov earlier this 
year.

“Going 
with 
Slaker 
and 

Lockwood is a little more skill 
game, and it’s fast — really fast — 
so it was (about) keeping up with 
them,” Warren said. “I think with 
Cutler and Nick, it’ll be more chip 

and chase, and we’ll bang bodies a 
little more.

“(I) just gotta get on defense fast. 

That’s my role, I get on ‘D’ fast and 
hit them, try to get the puck back 
and get it to Cutler or shoot it or 
something like that.”

Kile still out
While Michigan is switching 

up its lines in an attempt to spark 
the offensive production of Dancs 
and Warren, the Wolverines will 
still be without one of their key 
playmakers in senior forward 
Alex Kile. Kile has now missed the 
past four games, and will not be 
traveling this weekend either.

Kile has just 10 points on the 

season with six goals and four 
assists, but he has still had a 
significant impact — especially for 
a team that has struggled to score. 

“Alex is not only a captain, but 

he’s our leading scorer coming into 
the season, and he should be one 
of our leading scorers,” Berenson 
said. “So we’re losing an offensive 
fireplug with Alex Kile and one of 
our leaders.”

Michigan will need others, like 

Warren or Dancs, to step up this 
weekend, and Berenson has been 
impressed by the efforts of a pair of 
seniors in Kile’s absence.

“I think a lot of other guys 

have tried to pick up the slack,” 
Berenson said. “I think the other 
seniors, (Max) Shuart and Evan 
Allen, are playing their best hockey 
now, so good for them. But Alex 
Kile was on their line when he got 
hurt. So we’ll see when he comes 
back where he fits in, and hopefully 
he’ll give us a jumpstart.”

The good and bad of Michigan’s opening weekend

With just five contests from the 

Wilson-Demarini 
Tournament 

under its belt, the No. 11 Michigan 
softball team (3-2 overall) is at 
the onset of its regular season. 
And in the words of coach Carol 
Hutchins, the fairly young team 
has some growing to do. 

The 
Wolverines’ 
opening 

weekend featured a constant battle 
of ups and downs, underscored by 
two tough losses on Saturday — 
including a relatively unexpected 
6-4 loss to USF. One constant, 
though, was senior center fielder 
Kelly Christner, who batted .533 
with eight hits on the weekend.

Though it’s far too early to 

coin anything a trend, certain 
aspects of the weekend shouldn’t 
be ignored as the team moves 
forward this season.

The unpredictable performance 

of the pitching rotation, which 
demonstrated 
both 
great 

strengths and faults in the span of 
three days, proved to be one of the 
main areas of focus. Senior right-
hander Megan Betsa provided an 
unwavering presence, posting a 
0.41 earned-run average, striking 
out 15 against Delaware — just 
one K short of her single-game 
record. Fanning 27 over the course 
of the weekend, the pitching ace 
currently ranks eighth nationally 
in total strikeouts.

“I was pretty happy with my 

overall performance, other than 
the number of pitches I threw,” 
Betsa said. “Hutch told me on 
multiple occasions that I’m better 
than almost everyone I face, and I 
just need to believe that and trust 
my pitches and attack each hitter.”

For her dominance in the circle, 

Betsa received recognition as the 
Big Ten Pitcher of the Week for 
the seventh time in her career. 
Though Michigan eventually fell 
to Florida, 2-1, in its first Saturday 
loss, Hutchins credits Betsa with 
keeping the Wolverines in the 

game during the 10-frame contest, 
as she allowed only one earned run 
while striking out 12 batters.

Junior 
right-hander 
Tera 

Blanco had a packed weekend as 
well, starting a game each day on 
the mound. She earned two wins in 
three games pitched, highlighted 
by tossing eight strikeouts against 
Illinois State.

Despite their accomplishments, 

both 
Betsa 
and 
Blanco’s 

performances were also marred. 
Besta was displeased with the great 
deal of pitches she fired in her two 
outings in the circle, throwing 190 
against the Gators alone.

“We threw a lot of pitches and 

we gave up a lot of free bases in 
the (Florida) game,” Hutchins 
said. “And they were turning their 
lineup over for the third time 
when we had just finished going 
through once.”

Blanco, still relatively new to 

the collegiate pitching climate, 
experienced 
a 
fair 
share 
of 

inconsistency 
last 
weekend. 

Facing South Florida on Saturday, 
she allowed six runs off nine hits, 
yet she retired seven straight 
batters the day before.

The lack of sharpness and 

consistency from the circle will 
have to be amended in order for the 
rotation to obtain the depth it seeks.

Before 
the 
season 
began, 

Hutchins 
— 
unsure 
of 
how 

Michigan’s first contests would 
go — made it clear that the need for 
unseasoned players to step up this 
year was imperative, and she had 
no doubt her players would rise to 
the occasion.

Her call was answered by 

four 
Wolverine 
sophomores. 

On the first day of competition, 
second baseman Faith Canfield, 
right fielder Natalie Peters, left 
fielder Courtney Richardson and 
catcher Alex Sobczak spearheaded 
Michigan’s 
offensive 
efforts, 

accounting for 12 of Michigan’s 19 
hits and eight runs batted in.

Richardson was Friday’s leading 

hitter, driving in a three-run 
homer against Illinois State. While 
she had only one hit last season, 
she saw five in the past weekend 
alone, batting an impressive .417.

Last year, Peters saw 16 total 

at-bats and obtained five hits. 
During her time in Florida, she 
surpassed those numbers with 18 
at-bats from the leadoff position 
and six hits.

“(Peters) was really one of our 

steadiest performers over (last) 
weekend,” Hutchins said.

These 
underclassmen 
all 

started a majority of the games 
throughout the weekend, and 
proved 
themselves 
as 
both 

reliable fielders and batters for 
the Wolverines, exactly what 
Hutchins had trusted they would 
be able to do.

Both the evolution of the 

pitching rotation and the growth 
of Michigan’s underclassmen will 
be key elements for the team as it 
seeks to find success this season.

Wolverines start 3-0

The Michigan men’s lacrosse 

team was on a quest to start their 
season 3-0 for the first time in 
program history on Wednesday 
against Detroit Mercy.

With 
sophomore 
Brent 

Noseworthy and senior Ian King, 
who each tallied four goals on 
the night, leading the charge, 
that mission came to fruition in a 
15-10 win over the Titans. But the 
match was more hard-fought than 
the score indicated.

The Wolverines (3-0 overall) 

had a rocky start to the game, 
finding themselves playing catch-
up throughout the first half. 
Detroit (0-2), in contrast, scored 
43 seconds into the game and 
looked poised to secure its first 
win of the season. 

But 
Michigan 
responded 

quickly, scoring just a minute 
and a half later off the stick 
of sophomore attacker Rocco 
Sutherland. Sutherland — who 
scored only one goal last season 
— has four goals through three 
games this year.

Throughout the first quarter, 

the 
Wolverines 
proved 
their 

resilience as they never let the 
Titans’ lead grow larger than one, 
and ended the quarter down 3-2.

They kept that effort going 

in the second quarter. Defender 
Dickson Smith scored just 27 
seconds into the frame — the first 
goal of his Michigan career after 
transferring from Virginia as a 
graduate student.

The Wolverines and Detroit 

Mercy went on to trade goals the 
rest of the half, ending in a 5-5 tie.

Just 
13 
seconds 
into 
the 

third quarter, senior defensive 
midfielder 
Christian 
Wolter 

scored the first goal of his four-
year career to give the Wolverines 
the lead, one they wouldn’t 

relinquish the rest of the night.

After Wolter’s goal, Michigan 

found its stride, shutting out 
Detroit, 7-0, to open up a huge 
12-5 lead.

“We 
came 
off 
slow, 
we 

weren’t really playing our game,” 
Sutherland 
said. 
“We 
really 

came together at halftime as an 
offensive group and defensive 
group and really just buckled 
down and focused on our game 
plan and what we usually did in 
the prior two games and started 
to play our game.”

The Wolverines received a 

huge spark from King, who netted 
three goals in the third quarter 
alone. Just three games into the 
season, King is seven goals away 
from setting Michigan’s all-time 
record for goals and four points 
away from setting the all-time 
point record.

“No question, we are good 

transition team when we get those 
opportunities,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach John Paul. “It’s what 
sparked us in the third quarter. 
We have guys who can score when 
given the opportunity, and our 
defense played well — they just 
have to learn to play well for a full 
60 minutes.”

The fourth quarter continued 

in similar fashion for Michigan, as 
its defense continued its second-
half dominance and the offense 
received another boost — this time 
from Noseworthy, who scored 
three goals in the quarter to bring 
his season total to a team-high 11. 

Given 
their 
unprecedented 

start to the season, the Wolverines 
are 
currently 
in 
uncharted 

territory, but they know not to get 
overconfident for their Saturday 
matchup against Bellarmine (0-1).

“I think the most important 

thing with a quick turnaround 
like this is making sure we stay 
healthy and keep our legs fresh for 
Saturday,” Paul said.

fnding the energy of Detroit 
on Heidelberg Street

On Heidelberg Street, there 

exists an oasis. Wedged in 
between 
lines 
of 
relatively 

empty 
streets, 
a 
wild 

conglomeration of discarded 
objects and colorful houses lies 
sprawled over beaten grass. 
Every turn leads to somewhere 
new: 
The 
tucked-away 

basement 
of 
an 
abandoned 

house hides a sea of cast-off 
blue shoes; a series of wood 
clocks frames the path to a vast 
sign proclaiming: “Art is in the 
Eye of the Beholder.”

The 
Heidelberg 
Project 

isn’t pretty. Its many different 
pieces aren’t sculpted with 
neat 
elegance. 
Instead, 
its 

weathered edges gleam with 
chipped paint and authenticity. 
More 
than 
refinement, 
the 

spectacle of the Heidelberg 
Project is contained within its 
history. Every recycled object, 
every broken toy holds a story.

“Let 
me 
share 
a 
little 

something 
with 
you,” 
said 

executive 
director 
Jenenne 

Whitfield warmly as she began 
to introduce the Heidelberg 

Project. Whitfield explained its 
purpose with a bright passion 
that mimicked the animation of 
the street itself.

“We 
describe 
Heidelberg 

as 
a 
funky, 
outdoor 
art 

environment,” she said. “It’s 
been described as a ghetto 
Guggenheim. 
It’s 
been 

described as a playground for 
the imagination.”

And 
a 
playground 
it 
is, 

indeed. 
With 
houses 
like 

the vibrant Polka Dot House 
(officially 
titled 
the 
“New 

White House”) standing near 
structures made of scratched 
records and broken highway 
signs, 
it’s 
a 
space 
where 

boundaries don’t exist.

“It’s been many things to 

many people throughout its 
30-year 
history,” 
Whitfield 

said.

The 
Heidelberg 
Project 

means something different to 
every person who has viewed it. 
But the people who matter the 
most, the people who have been 
affected the most, are those 

surrounding Heidelberg — the 
Detroit community.

“Many of the people that 

visit 
Heidelberg 
talk 
about 

looking at what Tyree has done 
and thinking: ‘My God, if this 
man can do this, what can I do?’ 
” Whitfield said.

More than just a street, more 

than just an outlandish project, 
Heidelberg is an inspiration; 
its effect on the surrounding 
residents is distinctive from the 
experiences of those who drive 
in for a day solely to view the 
street’s infamous chaos.

“People in the community 

who 
have 
grown 
up 
with 

Heidelberg 
have 
now 
this 

creative energy to do other 
things,” Whitfield said.

When seeing the wonder of 

Heidelberg, there is oftentimes 
a 
motivation 
to 
innovate. 

Whitfield detailed the example 
of Phillip Cooley, co-owner of 
Slows Bar BQ in Detroit — a 
restaurant Cooley built with 
the help of friends, reusing 
old pieces in order to build a 
now-thriving small business. 
Cooley 
was 
encouraged 
by 

the Heidelberg Project, the 
way it works from within the 
community in order to improve 
the community, and moved 
to Detroit in order to open a 
restaurant that operates under 
the same notion.

“How many more people 

have been inspired by going 
and seeing and experiencing 
Heidelberg to go and create 
something 
else?” 
Whitfield 

mused.

The reason the Heidelberg 

Project is so influential is 
that it’s so genuine: both in its 
appearance, the way timeworn 
components are never altered 
into 
their 
more 
artificially 

pristine versions, and in its 
origin.

“When Tyree was six or 

seven, his great-grandmother 
… told him that he was going to 
be a very famous, great man,” 
Whitfield said.

Tyree 
Guyton 
and 
his 

grandfather, 
Sam 
Mackey, 

created the Heidelberg Project 
in 1986. Initially, it was started 
only because of a desire to clean 
up the neighborhood. After the 
Detroit riots of the late ’60s 
decimated the area he grew 
up in, Guyton attempted to 
rebuild: Painting bright colors 
on the sides of houses and 
affixing them with recovered 
materials. 

“(Guyton) talked about being 

a child at 12 and witnessing 
the riots and feeling like the 
world was coming to an end,” 
Whitfield said. “So that really 
became the drive in him.”

What is most vital about 

Heidelberg is that it was a 
solution that came from within 
the community, from someone 
who had been directly shaped 
by difficulties that had existed 
in the Heidelberg area. Guyton 
built the Heidelberg Project for 

no reason other than to help 
the neighborhood he grew up 
in. The selfless desire that was 
infused into every aspect of 
the project allowed it to evolve 
into the inclusive installation 
that it is today: a work of art 
that 
welcomes 
visitors 
but 

first and foremost is for the 

surrounding 
community. 

It’s a space for invention and 
innovation, hosting venues for 
neighborhood youth workshops 
and art exhibitions for new 
artists.

When 
people 
outside 
of 

Detroit talk about the city’s 
success, they can only look at 
the big picture: new stadiums 
built 
or 
flashy 
businesses 

constructed 
 — projects that 

are tailored to those living 
outside the scope of the city 
(and predominantly with a 
higher socioeconomic status). 
So caught up in the glamour 
of the prospect of a “new and 
improved” Detroit, many rarely 
notice the repercussions of 
these large-scale developments 
on the people actually living 
within the community; the 
pillars that Detroit rests on. 
The large corporations flocking 
to 
midtown 
or 
downtown 

Detroit oftentimes push into 
the community at the expense 
of residents who have inhabited 
the same area for generations: 
Home prices increase, people 
are 
shoved 
out 
and 
many 

families are forced to relocate.

While these new businesses 

have the power to garner 
widespread 
attention 
for 

Detroit, there is a danger in 
thinking of Detroit as a city that 
needs to be fixed. 

“(Detroit) 
is 
not 
coming 

back because it never went 
anywhere,” 
Whitfield 
said, 

“What I find just fascinating 
is that people are attracted to 
the kind of work that we do and 
want to be near us. But then 
they bring, with them, their 
resources, and that squeezes us 
out. Then they’ll get bored with 
this area, and they’ll go look for 
the next area.”

Detroit 
has 
a 
tireless 

energy. Its tenacity to keep 
persevering was perhaps born 
out of its tumultuous history. 
In the early to mid-1900s, the 
Great Migration initiated a 
large population of African-

Americans to move to Detroit 
from 
the 
southern 
United 

States. Faced with problems 
that stemmed from the city’s 
lack of housing combined with 
harsh 
discrimination 
and 

subsequent segregation, new 
African-American 
residents 

struggled to find a place in a 
city that strove to drive them 
out. Detroit is a city whose past 
has been largely shaped by the 
tension and conflict born out of 
exclusion and ignorance.

Still, no matter how many 

times Detroit appeared to crack 
with the tension fabricated 
by segregation and prejudice, 
it always found a way to keep 
moving forward.

The spirit of Detroit that 

current prospective businesses 
are attracted to lies in this: 
the determination and drive 
manifesting from a history 
of 
hardship. 
However, 
the 

reason so much of this new 
development 
occurs 
at 

the 
detriment 
of 
Detroit’s 

established community, with 
gentrification 
becoming 

increasingly prevalent in recent 
years, is because contenders 
who view the city as outsiders 
don’t see that the main force 
behind 
Detroit’s 
continuous 

persistence has been its people.

The energy of Detroit has 

always been contained within 
its 
inhabitants. 
Businesses 

that enter the city but do not 
recognize the significance of 
Detroit’s intrinsic communities 
can cause a disconnect: the city 
outwardly 
projecting 
strong 

economic advancements that a 
majority of its inhabitants do 
not have access to.

The increasing exclusion of 

the people of Detroit is why 
projects like Heidelberg are 
so imperative, now more than 
ever.

“(Heidelberg) has become a 

representation of everything 
that Detroit is … it represents 
the whole up-from-the-ashes 
concept,” Whitfield said. “The 
fear that I think a lot of people 
have about what is happening 
in Detroit and how people 
are being left out and not 
considered. Well, we say power 
to the people.”

The beauty of the Heidelberg 

Project does not come from its 
physical arrangement of objects, 
but rather from the fact that it is 
an establishment of the people 
and for the people. It works 
directly 
with 
surrounding 

communities in order to form 
an all-encompassing platform 
that encourages imagination 
on a personal level. It has the 
potential to lead to citywide 
economic and infrastructure 
developments that benefit the 
entirety of Detroit’s population, 
not just a small percentage.

Most crucial of all, the 

Heidelberg Project does not 
shut individuals out.

Even Whitfield herself has 

experienced 
gentrification 

at its finest, with her and her 
family currently in the middle 
of the process of leaving a place 
that they had moved into not 
even a decade earlier.

“We’re 
moving 
from 
the 

midtown area, which is now 
being celebrated as one of the 
comeback areas of Detroit, 
along 
with 
downtown,” 

Whitfield 
said. 
“Our 
hope, 

when we moved here eight 
years ago, was that we would 
buy this place. But, in the last 
three years, it doubled and that 
priced us out.”

However, 
Whitfield 
did 

not let these setbacks deter 
her from looking toward the 
unknown with resolve and 
fortitude.

“My attitude has to be: A 

place does not make me, I make 
a place,” Whitfield said. “So 
I’ll go somewhere else, and I’ll 
energize that new space.”

It is her steadfast optimism 

that ensures the future of the 

Heidelberg Project, especially 
considering Guyton is stepping 
down and promoting Whitfield 
to oversee the next saga of the 
Heidelberg: Heidelberg 3.0.

She described Heidelberg 3.0 

as, “an arts organization that is 
offering and opening its doors 
to young people and artists all 
over the world.”

It’s 
an 
exciting 
prospect 

that builds off the original 
Heidelberg Project in order to 
expand its message. Heidelberg 
3.0 hopes to include more young 
artists by giving them a space to 
explore their ideas, going even 
further to immerse art within 
communities of people.

The future of Detroit is in 

projects like Heidelberg; in 
the way it serves to both heal 
and elevate the surrounding 
communities; in the way it 
inspires creativity; and, most 
importantly, in the way it 
continuously, simply, strives to 
represent the people.

Detroit’s historic Corktown, 

home to some of the city’s 
hottest restaurants and bars, 
can expect a new addition this 
spring: Chef Kate Williams’ 
Lady of the House. 

Corktown, 
the 
oldest 

surviving 
neighborhood 

in Detroit, and an area of 
Irish 
immigrant 
settlement 

in the early 1800s, is also 
Williams’s 
current 
home. 

She is a Northville native 
and granddaughter to Irish 
immigrants who met at the 
Detroit 
Gaelic 
League 
on 

Michigan Avenue.

“I 
wanted 
to 
have 
a 

restaurant in Corktown and 
in Detroit, and it’s because I 
have so many roots here,” said 
Williams.

Lady of the House will 

occupy the space that formerly 
constituted the neighborhood 
spot 
St. 
CeCe’s, 
often 

frequented by Williams. The 
space was perfect for what 
Williams envisioned as being 
an 
intimate, 
neighborhood 

watering hole. In addition to 
the warm and comfortable look 
and feel of the space, buying the 
location struck a sentimental 
chord with Williams.

“It felt important that we 

kept that location in the Detroit 
neighborhood, in the ‘family’,” 
Williams said on choosing 
the former Irish pub as the 
location for her new spot.

Though a rising stronghold 

for 
up-and-coming 
spots, 

drawing and influx of visitors 
from outside the city, Corktown 
remains home to generations of 
residents.

“It’s 
still 
a 
livable 

neighborhood and we wanted a 
neighborhood spot,” Williams 
said.

However, 
Corktown 

appealed to Chef Williams for 

more than her personal history 
there. In 2010, around the time 
she left Detroit to work on her 
dining series in New York, the 
city’s low rent began attracting 
artists and innovators.

“At the time Detroit wasn’t 

really on the map and there 
were artists and makers that 
were doing really cool things,” 
she added. “The people that 
were flocking to Detroit at the 
time were also kind of creative 
and interested in something 
different.”

This 
surge 
prompted 

Williams’ 
return 
to 
the 

city. To her, it was less of a 
business decision and more of a 

romantic notion of showcasing 
Detroit’s potential. Williams 
noted she was inspired by the 
success of businesses like Dave 
Kwiatkoski’s Sugar House and 
James Cadariu’s Great Lakes 
Coffee Roasting Company.

Though initially struck by 

the creative forces leading 
the surge in businesses in the 
city, Williams also heeded the 
low rent as an opportunity for 

artistic freedom and financial 
flexibility.

“We could do something 

cool and approachable and ... 
drive the food scene as opposed 
to diners driving the food 
scene,” she said. In higher-end 
markets, Williams contends 
that overhead drives the price 
point.

At Lady of the House, she 

aims to introduce patrons to 
great food and drinks that are 
affordable and accessible.

“We wanted to show what 

we think in our experience is 
the best of everything but that 
doesn’t have a price point,” 
Williams said.

To Williams, affordability 

equates 
to 
creativity. 

Her calling card — whole 
animal 
preservation 
and 

highlighting 
local 
produce 

from Detroit’s urban farms — 
will unequivocally shape the 
menu at Lady of the House. 
She calls her aim to minimize 
food waste on farms hastag 
#uglyfood, a concerted effort 
to take produce that local 
farmers would otherwise have 
to throw out due to appearance 
and transform them.

“As a chef it forces you to 

be more creative with the 
scraps,” Williams said, “Are 
you dehydrating them and 
making them into a dust? 
Are you breaking them down 
and making an oil? Are you 
flavoring your vodkas and gins 
and spirits with them?”

She 
approaches 
animals 

and produce from a wholistic 
perspective, not just a means 
of cutting costs. “I feel like 
my style is very Old World 
cooking,” 
Williams 
said, 

recalling the need of her 
ancestors to use the entire 
animal body to survive with 
limited means.

With restaurants and chefs 

increasingly 
driving 
food 

trends, 
Williams 
wants 
to 

contribute 
this 
method 
of 

utilizing the entire animal 
and limiting food waste to 
the broader landscape of food 
consumption.

Williams also found the 

proportion of urban farms 
relative to Detroit’s population 

and the symbiotic relationship 
among community farmers to 
be unique to the city. The city 
benefits from urban farming 
businesses which train and 
employ local Detroiters and 
work closely with local chefs to 
cater to their needs.

“Sarah Papitz from Fresh 

Cut and Ryan Anderson and 
Hannah Clark from Acre Farm 
have organized this biannual 
meeting where the farmers are 
like, ‘What do you want us to 
grow?’” Williams said when 
discussing the community of 
farmers she works with.

This 
exceptional 

agricultural 
and 
local 

community is part of what 
drew Chef Williams back to 
Detroit after highlighting the 
city’s offerings in her monthly 
dining series in New York.

“It was like celebrating all 

these cool things people were 
doing in Detroit in New York,” 
she said. “And then I was like, 
‘We’ve got to do it here, because 
there’s a place for this in 
Detroit too.’” Not only does she 
consider the city lucky to have 
great local farmers, but also 
recognizes 
the 
significance 

of sourcing food that helps 
revitalize neighborhoods by 
supporting local business.

For Williams, Lady of the 

House represents what her 
career has been building up 

to. After her past experiences 
opening restaurants, including 
Republic and Parks and Rec 
where she headed the menu, 
she found herself ready to take 
the leap to pursuing her own 
venture.

“I figured out I wanted to be 

cooking everyday. I wanted to 
create something I was proud 
of. I wanted to cook food that 
I loved cooking and was happy 
to serve to people,” Williams 
said.

Though she has yet to plan 

the menu in detail — a task 
she’s eager to set her mind to 
once construction on Lady of 
the House begins — she intends 
to feature local purveyors like 
Joseph Wesley Tea Importers 
(named one of the top 25 tea 
companies in the world).

One 
of 
Eater 
Detroit’s 

most anticipated restaurant 
openings this year, Lady of 
the House will reflect the 
culmination of not only Chef 
Williams’ work but also the 
storied legacy of Corktown. 
As with her dining series, 
she’s sure to bring the spirit 
of Detroit and creative flare to 
the highly awaited Lady of the 
House.

Translucence & Video7’s 
developing Detroit sound

VIDEO7

Detroit music collective captures essence of city’s art scene

Last year in March I found 

myself stumbling out of a car 
on the corner of a street in 
Detroit. It was about 11 p.m. and 
I was standing in front of The 
Baltimore Gallery, a building 
hidden away from the tall 
buildings that decorate the city, 
but just as barren — that is, until 
I went inside. Having been led 
there by my sister and her friends, 
I paid my $5 upon entrance and 
continued toward where the 
music was. In an open room 
with walls decorated in strange, 
eccentric art, individuals were 
scattered across the room, some 
dancing and some standing, but 
all listening to the music.

It was a send-off party for the 

multi-art collective Video7. They 
had earned a spot in the Austin-
based music festival South by 
Southwest and needed to pay for 
expenses, whether that be for 
gas or whatever else. It would 
end up being the first official gig 
they played as the Detroit-based 
Video7. But the name and the 
people had been collaborating 
and creating long before this 
send-off party. The 18-member 
group that made its way to SXSW 
was four college students at the 
University of Michigan only two 
years before.

“It was the furthest channel 

from the main cable station on 
my old TV in Michigan,” said 
Brendan Asante, a founding 
member of the collective, in 
a phone interview with The 
Michigan Daily. “I had a big-ass 
60-inch flat screen, but it was an 
old one so it had the big booty 
in the back. I would connect 
an aux cord to the back … and 
whenever we were working on 
music I would be able to plug 
that aux cord into my phone or 
my laptop. But in order to do that 
the channel would have to be 
Video7.”

A graduate of the School 

of Music, Theatre & Dance 
having majored in jazz vocal 
performance, 
Asante, 
along 

with Ian Finkelstein, Spencer 
Cristobal and Atu began making 
music while at the University. 
But it wasn’t until January of 
2014 when the four were asked to 
play the EnspiRED fashion show 
that they needed a name for what 
they were doing. And so, Video7 
was born, and they quickly went 
from fashion shows to doing sets 
at Study Lounge to opening for 
2 Chainz and Vic Mensa at Hill 
Auditorium a couple months 
later. It was Music Matters’s first 
ever Springfest, and they showed 
up with the 60-inch TV in hand.

“When we got the gig to open 

for 2 Chainz, I brought the TV 
to the Hill Auditorium because 
I wanted to bring it on stage 
with us and put images on it,” 
Asante said. “But because we 
were openers, the sound dudes 
wouldn’t bother. It just sat in the 
back and then we had to bring it 
home.”

Despite having sold off the 

TV months ago, the mentality 
— what that TV and its channel 
came to represent — remains 
in 
Video7’s 
essence. 
Asante 

graduated in 2014 and his move 
to Detroit meant Video7’s move 
as well. The four-piece group 
slowly grew to be a collective 
as they met more artists willing 
to collaborate, and as more 
artists stuck around to do more. 

For a year and a half, Asante 
and Finkelstein lived together 
in Ferndale, and each Sunday 
would play with artists across 
Detroit. From there, from those 
Sunday sessions, a collective was 
born.

“We had Sunday Sessions 

when we were living at the 
Ferndale place,” Assante said. 
“Every Sunday people would 
come back and jive. Over time it 
was the same people who would 
come back looking forward to it 
and eventually, those were the 
people that ended up staying in 
the group.”

Much of the finding and 

locating artists to collaborate 
with 
was 
done 
secondhand 

through referrals. There were 
no auditions or try-outs; simply 
linking 
with 
other 
Detroit 

artists, hearing their music and 
what they could do. As they met 
a couple more artists through 
the Detroit producer Sterling 
Toles, Video7 transformed.

“When Video7 started doing 

the Detroit aspect we did it as 
a band, but then as it evolved 
the people in the group started 
creating their own songs,” he 
continued. “Now everyone’s in 
this solo/EP work still working 
with 
the 
same 
people 
but 

developing their own products 
to get out. And it’s all on the 
strength of it being created with 
people in Video7.”

But 
“multi-art 
collective” 

is still a little too vague and 
bureaucratic 
to 
accurately 

describe what Video7 is. “Oh, 
you should listen to this new 
multi-art 
collective” 
doesn’t 

roll off the tongue as nicely as 
“singer” or “band.” But when 
confronted with their music 
and their set-up, it seems to be 
one of the few words capable of 
describing it. Who cares if it’s 
vague? For Asante, that’s a part 
of the brand.

“It’s a band; it’s a collective; it’s 

a unit; it’s an enigma at the end of 
the day because the components 
that make it what it is are things 
that me and my homies didn’t 
foresee at all,” Asante said. 
“We didn’t realize that once we 
started planting our feet in the 
Detroit area that there were 
going to be these people that we 
would naturally gravitate to and 
share ideals or ideas with and 
this outlook towards music and 
creation.”

Over the past two years, Video7 

has developed and changed. The 
Webslinger, Spencer Cristobal, 
currently resides in L.A. and 
Stefon Dorsey, another founding 
member and graphic designer, 
set up in Seattle. They’ve played 
SXSW and opened for Common 
and Antwaun Stanley, while 
simultaneously playing across 
Detroit.

“It’s a force, and kind of a 

hidden force,” he continued. 
And the hidden aspect of the 
collective is what enables them, 
in Asante’s opinion, to remain 
freeform and do the unexpected. 
“As a personal artist and solo 
artist that’s what I’m in favor 
of instead of giving them what 
they’re expecting. That way 
when they come back for more 
they’ll be blown away each time 
by something that they haven’t 
experienced.”

It is the malleability and 

amorphous nature of the group 
that enables creation. Listening 
to their Soundcloud, there are 
three playlists: LOOPLANDS 
VOL. 1, LOOPLANDS VOL 2 

and their most recent channel 7: 
seasons. And the variety between 
these collections demonstrates 
the multifarious talent they have 
as a collective in terms of singers 
and rappers and especially in 
production.

“Looplands are our way of 

putting EPs together of little 
snippets, and the mixes, like 
channel 7, are to showcase the 
producers. Looplands showcase 
vocalists, singers and a couple 
rappers. Mixes show off the 
different production we do,” he 
said.

A playlist of four songs, each 

25 minutes, channel 7 is oriented 
toward showcasing production 
techniques. It is innovative in 
concept, and in its entirety, the 
perfect display of the collective’s 
enduring mind-set: “forward.”

“The whole thing of the 

channel Video7 being the farthest 
away from cable, the mainstream 
or what you expect — that kind 
of ideology really stayed put in 
everything that we did,” Asante 
continued. “You hear the mixes 
we have online like the channel 
7 seasonal mixes. All these kind 
of conceptual things are birthed 
from the mindset of trying to 
pave your own path and pave 
your own sonic path.”

Their sound and their music 

— it’s not derivative in any 
way. Take Yes’s “Tales from 
Topographic Oceans” and put 
it on Soundcloud. Keep the 
psychedelic but remove the 
rock and the Squire. Add funk, 
R&B, house and trap. Throw in 
some radio static and beautifully 
constructed, soulful choruses 
and you almost, almost have 
what Video7 has managed to 
create.

Because when I asked Asante 

what music has inspired their 
sound, he didn’t look to artists 
of olden days but rather to the 
people with whom he currently 
creates. And that, if anything, 
says more about their collective 
and their sound than anything 
else.

“I think the more tangible 

inspiration is seeing the people 
just like you and in the same 
places as you out here really 
grinding to make something 
happen,” he said. “I would say 
that’s the biggest inspiration. To 
see how all of us are balancing 
all these things and still coming 
back to the music because we 
love it so much.”

“It’s like if you’re travelling as 

a unit and someone’s straggling 
there’s always someone to pick 
them up and drag them along so 
everyone keeps going at the same 
pace — that’s a really inspiring 
thing for me,” he continued.

In its essence, Video7 is 

innovative and sonically new 
because they don’t look to the 
past but the present. Genre-wise, 
yes, there are always artists to 
look back on and admire and 
attribute to some degree. But to 
look to those you create with on 
a daily basis and think, “They’re 
the reason I keep creating and 
testing and experimenting” — 
that’s some heavy stuff.

Thursday night, Video7 is 

launching the first of their 
Cable 
Nites 
at 
the 
Marble 

Bar in Detroit. If you’re still 
confused about what “multi-
arts collective” means, now’s the 
time to find out. It will feature 
good times, good music, Asante 
himself, members Rella, CJay 
Hill, Asya Izme and many, many 
more.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

 
 
Donuts is a perfect project to play while chilling with friends, getting baked or buzzed, 

or even just being bored — a true triple threat. The hour-long beat-tape is jumpy, crowded and exciting 
enough to entertain even the most short-tempered or musically disinterested of your friends, especially if 
you’re chatting 
with them and chilling in the living room while listening to it. Especially if 

you’re 
eating donuts.

Why aren’t I eating any donuts right now? Damn, who forgot 
to bring donuts to the Donuts-listening session? Some 

writers we are.

Anyways, within each tiny “donut,” Detroit’s own 
beat-making guru, Jay Dee a.k.a. J. Dilla, constructs 

vivid, complicated vibes that are each uniquely 
different from their predecessors. With each 
beat switch, he swings the mood from calm 
to chaotic, energetic to easing, often seeming 
like a conductor who is in control of infinite 
orchestras, capable of creating within any and 
every soundscape. 

One minute you’re listening to “Times,” 

imagining yourself strolling coolly down the 
sidewalk on perfectly sun-kissed day and 
desperately trying to forget the time Drake rapped 
over it; then the next you’re tossed into the rowdy 
tornado of sound that is “Glazed.” Such is the magic of 

Dilla; such is the magic of Donuts.
But it’s the ineffably, impeccably thick textures of every 

track, the way that even their background’s background 

grooves shake your speakers and rattle your perception of taste, 

that give the project its cohesiveness: No other producer is able to 

achieve Dilla’s signature bang. No other producer ever will learn to.

— Salvatore DiGioia

J Dilla’s ‘Donuts’

in this series, three daily arts writers in varying states 

of mind do the same activity and write about it.

Baked and buzzed are debating who should be baked and who should be buzzed. Great points being 

made around the board.

But Dilla is staying constant for sure. It’s strange that music has been compared to actual 

physical donuts tonight (as the now determined buzzed said), and I’m having a hard 

time reaching baked and buzzed’s mental realm. Doesn’t sound completely 

right that music can actually be eaten. Not totally sure about that one.

I always forget how jumpy dilla’s music is until a high pitched 

woman just pops out of nowhere and then disappears. Also 

kinda crazy they’re releasing like the 15th dilla tape. 

Do we have a limit for greed? Can we stop try-

ing to hologram dead people for festival 

profit? Can we stop trying to hologram in 

general?

As an important side note the fire alarm went off for 

a solid 5 minutes and it brought me too close back to those 

traumatizing elementary school fire alarm drills. Thank god 

my house isn’t up to code and the alarms don’t work even when they 

should. I’d rather die.

In summary, I can never figure out when one song starts and the next ends, but 

I’m into it either way.

Oh fuck. Plot twist. I am baked. It was me arguing about buzzed and baked. Dammit. I 

screwed this up.

— Daily Arts Writer

“i’m definitely high but like I’m always high”
Lmao
fam you know Dilla was really the GOAT when you start 

hallucinating that you’re in a fuckin 50s chicago jazz bar for like 4 
minutes straight. purely on the virtue of how fucking happy this 
record makes me it’s a deffo top 5 record of all time honestly, fuck 
me. we all just started pegging current rappers who would kill 
different songs on the record and it gave me a proper fuckin idea of 
how timeless this man’s beats were. maybe it’s bc I’m plastered but 
his beats been pluckin my heartstrings for a hot sec boi o boi

i just slammed a fucking cheesesteak and sack of fries and now 

I think I’m dying. where tha Beano at thooooOoOoooOoOOoo. oh 
lmao the fire alarm went off holla

so honestly this experience is mad eye-opening to the ingenuity 

this legend produced. considering i’m too hammered to focus 
on too much shit at once, i straight been only focusing on the 
music and lemme tell ya this fucker was the motor city mahler, 
fuuuuuuck me.

i still need this beano,boys
what’s mind blowing is that this is purely a beat tape and it’s 

one of the most MINdblowing compositions ive listened to in my 
life, deadasssssssssss. like i’d want kids only if to lecture the little 
pricks on the masterpieces i listened to at their age.

one of these cacs just started spitting his own bars over these 

beats. life can’t get any better than this shit wow

folks,,,, donuts by j dilla is extremely good as hek

CAMILO JOSÉ VERGARA

Vergara finds ruins of 
modern-day Detroit

Chilean photographer captures the remains and 
deurbanization of Detroit inner-city and suburbs

“I 
have 
always 
been 

interested in the things that 
fail,” 
said 
photographer 

Camilo José Vergara.

With a keen eye for 

spaces and an obsession 
for photographing cities, 
Vergara displays rawness 
and realism about Detroit in 
his visual book “Detroit is 
No Dry Bones: The Eternal 
City of the Industrial Age.”

No, it wouldn’t make 

much 
sense 
to 
classify 

Detroit as a “failed” city 
— a space that is absorbed 
in urban art, culture and 
drive, Detroit is to be 
placed in its own category. 
But in retrospect, Detroit’s 
urban 
structures 
and 

city 
population 
have 

significantly 
decreased 

within the past 50 years, 
and Vergara has been able to 
exemplify this declination 
through his photos.

The 
Chilean-born 

photographer began taking 
photos at a young age, 
and studied sociology at 
Notre Dame and Columbia 
University. 
The 
artist 

claimed that he “did not 
have large ghettos” where 
he lived, and that is what 
drew him to the rougher 
parts of Camden, Chicago, 
New York and Detroit.

Vergara discussed how 

he would hear rumors and 
stories where things “could 
not get worse.” As someone 
who 
was 
always 
been 

interested in neighborhood 
and 
towns, 
and 
by 

continuously revisiting the 
Detroit, Vergara was eager 
to find what the next steps 
were for the city.

What 
makes 
Vergara 

unique 
among 
many 
is 

his concept of revisiting 
the same locations over 
and over again over a long 
period of time. 

His book begins with an 

introduction 
discussing 

his passions and reasons 
for 
photography, 
and 

specifically, photographing 
the Motor City. Then, the 
very first two pages after 
the intro, the reader sees 
two drastically different 
photos taken from the exact 
same vantage point (“south 
from the roof of the former 
Carlton Plaza Hotel”).

One of these photos, 

flourished 
with 
color, 

business and community, 
was taken in 1998; the 
second, 
showing 
the 

same 
places, 
bleak 
and 

abandoned, was taken in 
2003. Below is a photo 
featured in the book, taken 
from 
a 
similar 
vantage 

point to the two photos 
from the intro, but this one 
was taken in 1991. 

Even 
in 
those 
five 

years, Vergara understood 
that 
spaces 
are 
“used 

for different people and 
purposes,” including old 
warehouses, vacant houses 
and over-vegetated streets 
and walkways.

“There 
are 
a 
lot 
of 

stories that are completely 
un-protectable,” 
Vergara 
emphasized 

when 
describing 
these 

photographs. 
The 
story 

of 
a 
building 
changes 

as 
its 
function 
does: 

Warehouses once meant for 
manufacturing car parts 
are now used as a space for 
adolescent paintball fights. 
More 
of 
these 
hidden 

stories were explored when 
Vergara hit the suburbs.

Dichotomic and heavy, 

Vergara 
showed 
me 
a 

photo of two neighboring 
suburban houses. Although 
feet apart from one another, 
they look as though they are 
from two different worlds. 

Vergara 
mentioned 

the extent to which the 
abandoned house on the 
left is disheveled, where all 
that is left is a wide-open 
back yard, pest infestation, 
broken 
windows 
and 
a 

trashcan. 
Meanwhile, 

the viewer sees the house 
directly to the right, a well-
kept and tidy space clearly 
occupied by humans.

“I became sensitive to 

the small things,” Vergara 
said. This among many of 
his photos clearly focuses 
on 
the 
urban-decay 
of 

the city and the suburbs. 
“Sometimes the neighbor 
will clean up the front yard 
… If your neighbor looks 
bad, you look bad.”

In the idea of abandoned 

houses, 
another 
one 
of 

Vergara’s triptychs shows 
the 
house 
titled 
“The 

Edmund,” which was built 
in 1885. 

With the overgrowing 

bushes 
and 
shattered 

roof, 
the 
house 
almost 

looks apocalyptic. Vergara 
mentioned 
the 
paradox 

between 
the 
Detroit 

houses 
that 
are 
vacant 

and the houses that are 
still being lived in, both 
“giving the feeling that 
they are in battle, fighting 
for 
survival.”Both 
when 

observing these locations 
in 
person 
and 
through 

his photos, Vergara said 
that people tend to ask: 
“How did this happen?” A 
question looming in the air, 
it is ineffable to say what is 
the cause for these parts of 
cities like Detroit to fall out 
of existence.

“People in the future, I 

believe, will want to know 
about 
the 
evolution 
of 

postindustrial Detroit in 
terms of the visual forms 
of everyday life,” Vergara 
wrote in the introduction 
of his book. “But there are 
disincentives to probing this 
subject. Scholars interested 
in Detroit and other cities 
undergoing 
depopulation, 

disinvestment, 
and 

dereliction are eager to 
find ways to return them 
to prosperity — usually, 
however, at the cost of 
ignoring 
the 
physical 

adaptations 
and 
new 

beginnings made by locals 
in their struggle to survive.”

He captures more than 

just bird’s-eye views of 
cities and eerie abandoned 
house 
photos. 
He 

incorporates 
sculptures, 

landmarks, 
objects 
and 

most 
importantly, 
the 

people of Detroit. 

What Vergara possesses 

which 
is 
even 
more 

insightful than his photos 
are his precious stories and 
his patient perseverance to 
reveal to the world the odd 
and beautiful truth that is 
Detroit.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

 
Chance the Rapper’s 

most recent video, “Same Drugs,” 
is a let down. Given the expecta-
tions Chance has set for himself 
with his critically acclaimed album, 
Coloring Book, his powerful per-
formance on SNL last winter and a 
slew of other noteworthy creative 
endeavors, the video is a let down. 
Not only does the “Same Drugs” 
video not live up to Chance’s track 
record — it fails the complexity 
and quality of the original. The 
CDQ track of “Same Drugs” moves 
smoothly between wanting and 
uplifting. Chance sings of love lost 
and a childhood left behind, before 
ending with a positive look at the 
future.
 
The video mimics some-

thing like a 1980s children’s TV 
variety show: the type one might 
see on “Sesame Street” or any other 
PBS program, where Chance plays 
piano next to a goofy looking mup-
pet in a jazzercise get up. As he 
croons the first verse, the muppet 

lays slumped on his shoulder.
 
Aesthetically, the first 

two thirds is a strange mix of con-
temporary minimalism and 1980s 
maximalism. The shots are simple, 
but everything is soaked in a pink 
tint, and both Chance and the Mup-

pet have loud outfits on. It’s more of 
a headache than it is nostalgic.
 
And the first verse drags. 

It’s mostly Chance singing and sup-
porting a passed out muppet. The 
moment of climax and excitement, 
when the muppet wakes up for 
the chorus, might have been more 
exciting if it wasn’t entirely pre-
dictable. In any case, the muppet 
wakes up and adds her own set of 
vocals, jarring in comparison to the 
smooth croon of the album version.

 
There is one last twist; 

towards the end of the video, 
Chance leaves the set of the faux 
variety show to reveal everyone 
working the set is also a muppet. 
The retro tint disappears and 
Chance walks off the set as the song 
plays out.
 
The message here is 

kinda fun, albeit a bit obvious. 
Muppets pretending to be humans 
are equal parts nodding to a child-
ish surrealism and a drug addled 
reality. Coloring book is an album 
drenched with a heartwarming 
nostalgia for simpler times. The-
matically, the video lines up with 
the album’s overarching theme.
 
So Chance gets some 

points for trying. The video’s not 
cliché or derivative, or lacking from 
any artistic vision. It’s just, unfortu-
nately, pretty boring.for.

Detroit’s sustainability 
leader: work with heart

Local co-working space Green Garage illustrates the potential 
harmony between eco-friendly practices and economic success

Sustainability and economic 

growth do not have to be 
contradictory. With the right 
infrastructure and leadership, 
reducing a business’s carbon 
footprint 
can 
be 
quite 

inexpensive. In Detroit, the 
Green Garage leads by example, 
proving that sustainability is 
not at the expense of economic 
growth. This shared workspace 
houses 
50 
businesses 
and 

non-profits all engaged in the 
community that seek to improve 
the lives for all Detroiters. 
The Green Garage consumes 
approximately 1/10th of the 
energy compared to, on average, 
other office building of its size. 
Located in Midtown, one of 
the city’s main urban renewal 
hotspots, the Green Garage 
paves the way for the most 
innovative 
advancements 
in 

sustainability 
and 
highlights 

the importance of an inclusive 
working community.

Last summer, I had about 

as 
good 
of 
an 
internship 

opportunity as possible — one 
which 
would 
make 
anyone 

jealous. Even though I wasn’t 
coding for Google and making 
$20,000 a month or advising 
the president on foreign policy, I 
was a part of a work-community 
that cared about issues beyond 
its four walls. I worked for 
Fresh Corner Café, a food 
business focused on improving 
Detroiters’ access to healthy and 
affordable food, which is housed 
in the Green Garage.

My work with Fresh Corner, 

along with everyone else in 
the Green Garage, positively 
impacts the lives of Detroiters. 
Rather than ignoring lifelong 
residents’ voices and concerns at 
the expense of selfish gain, the 
Green Garage’s many businesses 
listen and cater to them. There 
is an omnipresent commitment 
to the future of Detroit, one that 
will be better for everyone.

It’s astounding how dreary 

and soul-sucking some office 
spaces can be. With unflattering 
fluorescent lights and crusty 
carpets, it’s no surprise why 
many people dread going into 
work. If workers must spend 40 
hours a week in the same place, 
it only makes sense to put forth 

the resources to create a more 
livable and aesthetically pleasing 
environment. The Green Garage 
is an archetype for livable office 
spaces, but not in a douchey tech-
startup kind of way with ping 
pong tables and flashy colors. 
It’s understated and beautiful, 
including lots of natural lighting 
and gorgeous wood floors and 
ceilings.

Everyone 
entering 
the 

building is warmly greeted by 
Manager Matt Piper. He grew 
up just northeast of the city in 
Harrison Township and later 
attended Wayne State University, 
receiving both a bachelor’s and 
master’s degree there. Since 
then, he has lived in Detroit for 
ten years. Piper firmly believes 
that other businesses can do 
their part in becoming more 
sustainable. 

“We are an extreme case of 

people who have worked hard to 
reduce the impact of our activity, 
but everyone can do something,” 
Piper said. “Certainly, people 
can consider installing more 
energy efficient windows, better 
recycling, and a composting 
plant.”

The Green Garage features 

a zero-waste recycling system 
in which very little is actually 
thrown 
out. 
Its 
extensive 

composting 
system 
supports 

an urban ecosystem around the 
building. A lot more goes into the 
Green Garage’s environmental 
efficiency, however.

“Our heating system is a solar 

thermal system that doesn’t 
generate electricity, but heats 
up 5,000 gallons of water that 
is then pumped through tubes 
under the floor,” he said. “The 
heat then rises.”

In 
2013-2014, 
the 
Green 

Garage spent about $3,100 on 
electricity, which is shockingly 
less than the average cost of 
an office building of its size: 
$28,000. The main factor of the 
Green Garage’s sustainability is 
its thick insulation.

“The best thing you can do 

is insulate the building really 
well and reduce the demand 
for heating and cooling. Our 
insulation is so thick that it takes 
longer to change the thermal 
properties of the building,” Piper 
said.

The Green Garage is unlike 

other 
shared 
workspaces. 

In lieu of closed offices, the 

building features an open work 
environment in which businesses 
operate all in one place separated 
by small dividers. In the back of 
the building are more private 
conference rooms. This design, 
according to Piper, was inspired 
by Christopher Alexander’s book 
“Pattern Language.”

“The key insight is that 

a 
building 
should 
have 
a 

progression of public to private 
space. When you walk in, it is 
most public. We want it to be 
non-hierarchal 
where 
cross-

pollination 
and 
information 

sharing happen naturally, and 
the open-plan facilitates that. 
You get to know your neighbors.”

Piper 
emphasized 
the 

importance 
of 
the 
Green 

Garage’s tightknit and inclusive 
community, and I can attest 
to this. The building offers 
more than just an incubator for 
professionals.

“In a time where things seem 

to be so divided, it feels special 
that we’re bucking that trend 
and finding ways to be accepting 
and welcoming to one another,” 
he said. “We have a place 
where people of all different 
backgrounds come together to 
work and be intentional about 
the fact that they accept one 
another. We start everything 
with the idea that we are more 
than just an office building and 
find ways to help people grow.”

Regarding the city’s future, 

Piper remained optimistic.

“I think that we are one of 

many leaders looking toward 
a more sustainable future for 
Detroit There are a lot of other 
people that speak our language 
and think along the same lines,” 
Piper said. “We are a place where 
the future leaders of Detroit are 
getting started.”

The Green Garage represents 

the 
potential 
for 
positive 

social impact in the city. If the 
resources are there, there truly 
is no reason not to increase 
sustainability. With an emphasis 
on community, the Green Garage 
is a place where professionals 
all look forward to work rather 
dreading it. My time working 
here opened my eyes to the 
potential for improved work 
spaces more similar to a home 
rather than a typical office. And, 
I was fortunate enough to call 
the Green Garage my home for 
two months.

‘Detroiters’ is a two-bit 
buddy comedy with heart

Created by and starring two Detroit natives, Comedy Central’s 
newest sitcom puts the Motor City on display in all its comedic glory

“Detroiters” 
co-creators 

Tim Robinson (“SNL”) and 
Sam Richardson (“Veep”) were 
determined to shoot their new 
buddy sitcom on location in 
Detroit, and after watching the 
series pilot, it’s evident why. 
Shots of Detroit landmarks 
aside, the series seamlessly 
weaves the city’s narrative into 
its very own, calling on viewers 
to shift their perspective of the 
city. The series is the first in a 
long time to be set in the motor 
city; while it doesn’t address 
Detroit’s history or current 
socioeconomic 
landscape 

directly, 
the 
series 
subtly 

nods to its setting in theme 
and story, harking back to the 
past in order to set its focus on 
moving towards the future.

After inheriting his father’s 

ad 
agency, 
Tim 
Cramblin 

(Tim Robinson), along with 
his partner Sam Duvet (Sam 
Richardson), struggle to live 
up to the agency’s (and the 
city’s) former glory. With Tim’s 
legacy on the line, the standard 
premise is treated with higher 
stakes, balancing comedy with 
heart.

In 
the 
first 
scene, 
the 

two are shown producing a 
second-rate 
commercial 
for 

the 
robe- 
and 
crown-clad, 

jacuzzi king of Detroit, Eddie 
Champagne (Steve Higgins, 
“Saturday Night Live”). Before 
Eddie is doused in boiling 
water in a cheap practical 
effect, Tim and Sam dismiss 
the potential hazard. Their 
obliviousness establishes the 
expectation that neither are 
equipped to handle their jobs, 
making their blundering path 
towards success all the more 
entertaining.

The Second City Detroit 

alums 
are 
a 
well-matched 

comedic 
team 
with 

authentic 
rapport. 
Though 

the two characters are so 
interconnected 
— 
they’re 

childhood friends, coworkers 
and 
brothers-in-law 
— 

their 
characters 
verge 
on 

becoming one in the same. The 
cornerstone of a great sitcom 
friendship is the possession of 
a quality by one character that 
their counterpart lacks (i.e. 
Rachel and Monica, Jess and 
Nick and so forth). Perhaps 
this will become clearer as the 
series progresses, and for now, 
their natural chemistry makes 
up for the lack of inherent 
distinction between the two. 

When it comes to wooing 

clients, 
Sam 
and 
Tim 

effectively act as 
a single, in-sync 
unit. Even their 
brash decision to 
pitch 
to 
Carter 

at his hospitable 
bed is met with 
wholehearted 
agreement 
between the two. 
They 
attempt 

to 
persuade 

Chrysler 
executive 
Carter 

Grant 
(Jason 
Sudeikis, 

“Saturday Night Live”) to hear 
their pitch is one comedic gaff 
after another. Their efforts 
range 
from 
Tim 
staining 

his tie with steak sauce to 
accidentally 
hitting 
Carter 

with their car. In one sequence, 
the two attempt to break a 
glass door pane with various 
office items before swallowing 
diet pills decades past their 
expiration 
date. 
Though 

loosely connected, the series of 
events remains amusing. While 
seemingly unmotivated, their 
asinine actions lead them to a 
revelatory moment in which 
they craft an unexpectedly 
smart, resonant tagline for 
Chrysler — one that plainly 
sings Detroit’s praise.

Much 
like 
the 
winding 

nature of the series itself, 
Sam 
and 
Tim 
appear 
to 

meander carelessly until they 
stumble upon some revelation 
or opportunity. The show’s 
sketch-like structure, similar 
to that of “Broad City,” lends 
itself to the plot’s discursive 
pattern and Sam and Tim’s 
absurdist 
physical 
comedy 

and harebrained one-liners. 

Moments of farce balanced by 
pathos that doesn’t feel forced 
or cheesy are meant to surprise 
the show’s audience.

The 
show’s 
tendency 
to 

surprise is very much in tune 
with the theme of confounding 
expectations throughout the 
pilot. Sam and Tim show us 
a side of Detroit that feels 
authentic, but put their spin 
on it, melding together the old 
with the new. Sam’s house, 
which sits next door to Tim 
and 
Sam’s 
sister 
Chrissy’s 

(Shawntay 
Dalon, 
“Daylight”) is a 
dilapidated relic 
of Detroit that 
Sam’s 
trying 

to 
flip 
(with 

difficulty). 
He 
lives 

there 
happily, 

withstanding 
the ruin with his 

infectious optimism.

Sheila (Pat Vern Harris, 

“Sirens”), 
Sam 
and 
Tim’s 

elderly 
secretary, 
is 
a 

caricature of the antiquated 
workplaces characteristic of ad 
agencies in the ‘50s and ‘60s. 
Her attempts to act seductively 
while confusing Tim for his 
father (referred to as “Big 
Hank”) are a comical reminder 
of a past at odds with modern 
times. 

The theme of past and 

present set within Detroit’s 
cityscape, in addition to Sam 
and Tim’s endearing desire to 
succeed in spite of themselves 
and 
their 
circumstances, 

is what gives the show its 
legs and launches it past its 
conventional 
sitcom 
setup. 

Though not quite edgy — but 
nowhere near bland — the 
series has great potential to 
push its sketch-like comedy 
(the result, no doubt, of the 
heavy involvement of “SNL” 
alum) even further, allowing 
its characters and setting to 
really shine. The series is a 
testament to what a little bit of 
heart can add to quirky comedy 
and a simple set up.

What happened to rest?

I get it, you’re busy.
I am too –– the pace of life is 

moving so fast, you can’t even stop 
to consider the idea of slowing 
down. Even if you do consider such 
a thing, I doubt you’ll really do it.

What is it that are we so driven 

by that makes it impossible to 
consider slowing down? We are 
consumed by the notion that every 
second of every day has to be put 
toward something and hold some 
sort of purpose.

If we choose to rest, it is only to 

equip us to go on to accomplish the 
numerous tasks of the next day. 
If we choose to do something fun 

or less stressful one day — let’s say 
watch a movie — it is only to provide 
a brief form of relief. Until we move 
on to the next task and the cycle 
continues.

We have all lost the incentive to 

enjoy life at a slower pace. Because 
if we stop, that other person who 
kept going has a “better shot.” 
They’ll make it and I won’t. That’s 
the mentality I think we are living 
under and it is strangely paralyzing, 
though paradoxically: If I slow 
down in efforts to revitalize my 
energies enough to move forward, 
the person who didn’t stop will be 
one step ahead. It leaves us stuck in 
this battle of trying to do too much 
or feeling guilty if we take time to 
pause.

My agenda is tightly packed 

— too much so, I’ll admit. Even 

sitting down to write this demands 
a certain amount of peace and 
patience that I’m not sure I know 
where to find at this point in my 
life. My weekends become just 
as packed as the weekdays; even 
vacations carry a lingering guilt, 
almost a sinking feeling as my body 
and mind slow down. It’s a feeling 
that shouldn’t be foreign to us, but I 
feel it has become that way.

It’s the thought lurking in your 

mind: I should be doing something.

Our inability to rest or slow down 

is due, in part, by the technological 
advancements 
that 
make 
our 

information so instantaneous –– 
we are addicted now to making the 
rapid pace of life the norm. We are 
connected to so much online, it feels 
foreign to remove ourselves from 
that and just sit still.

A friend of mine recently shared 

with me the idea that we have 
grown to “compete” in our levels 
of workload. If one person you 
converse with is “so busy” with his 
or her three essays, you can think 
to yourself: “Well, I have three 
essays too and a midterm. Don’t 
tell me about a busy week.” There 
is an underlying pride that emerges 
through this game of comparison 
and if anything, it just pushes us to 
do more.

While looking at all that demands 

your attention — class, homework, 
clubs, career plans — what is it that 
you really want to win your time?

Typically, it is not what you are 

hoping for. The fun movie night you 
had planned is now canceled. The 
10 hours of sleep you hoped for has 
now been dwindled down to five. 

Those amazing friends you wish to 
visit who live in Chicago, D.C. and 
New York will have to wait another 
season. It looks like next weekend 
won’t work after all for a visit.

Your phone reminds you of all 

the people you wish to call and 
catch up with. Scrolling through 
Facebook deceives you, where it 
seems like everyone has so much 
time for so many things and you are 
the one who needs to catch up.

Our time off, that we refer to 

as “free time,” has entirely lost 
its meaning. This “freedom” has 
to have such purpose, such drive 
and amount to such success, that 
the very value to which we find 
our most treasured relationships 
and feelings are discarded for the 
sake of finding purpose. This isn’t 
freedom — it’s restriction.

This isn’t to say that busyness 

needs to evaporate in order for value 
in life to be restored. Maybe the 
purpose behind all this craziness 
is that we have found ourselves 
stuck in needs to be reevaluated to 
some extent. That nice dinner with 
friends may cost you a few hours 
of homework. And then sleep. And 
maybe rob you of some peace the 
following day.

But remember that you need to 

slow down once in a while. Slowing 
down doesn’t mean falling into a 
trap of laziness or apathy; rather, it 
is finding the form of genuine and 
honest rest. That way, when you 
actually gain some free time, you’ll 
know what to do with it. For the 
moments that feel incredibly hectic 
and busy, you’ll be more energized 
and prepared to face them.

What would you do if you 

knew that your days were 
numbered?

Or, more specifically, what 

would you do if, at just thirty-
two years young, at the peak 
of your career, right as the 
infinite hours you had spent 
studying, honing your craft and 
preparing to champion your 
competitors had finally begun 
to gain you infinite credibility 
and creative freedom, your 
days 
became 
numbered, 

indefinitely numbered, by a 
rare, irreversible blood disease?

A decade ago, James DeWitt 

Yancey — also known as Jay 
Dee, or perhaps most famously, 
J. Dilla — faced this exact 
scenario. In early 2003, after 
returning from a short tour 
abroad, Yancey fell ill. Upon 
visiting an emergency room, he 
was diagnosed with thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic 
purpura 

(TTP), a rare condition that 
causes small blood clots to form 
throughout the body, inhibiting 
the flow of oxygen-rich blood.

Suddenly, 
Yancey’s 
days 

became numbered, his fate 
eternally altered and eerily 
given an expiration date, but 
he seems to have been more 
inspired by the news of his life’s 
brevity than he was impaired. 
He 
resumed 
his 
creative 

process as usual, teaming up 
with legendary Los Angeles 
producer 
Madlib 
for 
their 

historic, collaborative Jaylib 
LP in 2003, then eventually 
relocated from Detroit to L.A., 
along with his mother, Maureen 
“Ma Dukes” Yancey, to both 
seek 
out 
optimal 
medical 

treatment 
and 
plant 
roots 

closer to the musical action.

Of course, this wasn’t the 

first time that Detroit’s own 
Jay Dee departed from the 

Mitten-state. 
In 
1994, 
his 

early musical mentor, Joseph 
“Amp” Fiddler, a keyboardist 
and producer who toured with 
George Clinton and the P-Funk 
All-Stars, introduced Yancey’s 
work to Q-Tip of A Tribe Called 
Quest upon running into him at 
Lollapalooza.

Q-Tip was impressed by 

Yancey’s work, so much so 
that, after the meeting, the 
producer 
began 
“traveling, 

networking, and doing credited 
and 
uncredited 
work 
for 

artists such as Janet Jackson, 
Busta Rhymes, De La Soul, 
and The Pharcyde,” according 
to his official biography. He 
eventually became a part of 
the Ummah production team, 

which created primarily for 
A Tribe Called Quest and also 
included Q-Tip, Yancey, and DJ 
Ali Shaheed Muhammad.

Unfortunately, 
Dilla’s 

newfound 
success 
as 
a 

producer put the progression 
of Slum Village, a Detroit rap 
group made up of him, along 
with childhood friends R.L. 
“T3” Altman and the late Titus 
“Baatin” Glover, largely on 
hold. Though he would return 
to his roots shortly to work on 
the team’s first major project, 
Fantastic, Vol. 1., after earning 
serious praise from ?uestlove 
and 
D’Angelo, 
figureheads 

who could offer him access 
into an entirely separate realm 
of 
sound, 
Yancey 
became 

distanced from his bandmates, 
likely due to his increasingly 
demanding solo work-load.

In 
the 
early 
2000s, 
J. 

Dilla produced ten songs for 
Common’s 
classic 
LP, 
Like 

Water 
For 
Chocolate, 
and 

contributed to Erykah Badu’s 
Mama’s Gun, crafting standout 
track “Didn’t Cha Know” and 
earning himself a Grammy 
nomination in the process. 
He had separated from Slum 
Village to join one of the most 
premier musical movements 
of the last few decades, one 
that 
indefinitely 
inspired 

Kanye West’s early interest 
in sampling soul records and 
led to the creation of records 
that remain vital almost two 
decades later.

“I 
went 
to 
a 
recording 

session with Talib Kweli at 
Electric Ladyland and you guys 
had the whole building,” Dave 
Chapelle recalled, appearing 
as a guest on The Tonight Show 
Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2014 
and aiming his comment at 
?uestlove, the drummer of the 
show’s house band, The Roots.

“They 
had 
D’Angelo 

downstairs, and Common was 
in one floor, and Erykah [Badu] 
was in another show, I mean 
another recording studio, and 
Mos [Def] and [Talib] Kweli 
are on the roof, and Ahmir 
[“?uestlove” 
Thompson] 
is 

running up and down, and 
James [DeWitt Yancey, a.k.a. J. 
Dilla] and everybody playing on 
everybody’s sessions…”

Nowadays, such a scenario 

sounds like a music nerd’s 
fantasy, 
a 
session 
that’s 

obviously too good to be true. 
But back then, it was business 
as usual: Some of the greatest 
hip-hop, neo-soul and R&B 
tracks ever created came out 
of sessions that were more 
closely 
related 
than 
most 

people realize. Furthermore, 
James 
DeWitt 
Yancey 
was 

present in quite a few of them, 
masterminding 
the 
finer 

details and deciding when each 
was finished.

But towards the end of 2005, 

after 
arriving 
in 
Southern 

California, J. Dilla became 
seriously 
unwell. 
He 
was 

soon diagnosed with Lupus, a 
disease wherein one’s immune 
system hyper-actively attacks 
healthy tissue, and eventually, 
this led to kidney failure and 

his requirements of repeated 
dialysis treatments.

Like I said, right as the 

infinite hours that he had spent 
studying sound, honing his 
craft and preparing himself 
to 
sonically 
champion 
his 

competitors had finally begun 
to gain serious attention, James 
DeWitt Yancey’s days became 
numbered.

According to J. Dilla’s official 

biography, he “spent his final 
months doing what he loved 
the most—creating music. He 
released Donuts, his third solo 
LP, on February 7, 2006 before 
passing away three days later at 
the age of 32.”

Since 
then, 
Donuts 
has 

evolved into one of the most 
praised pieces of music ever. 
In his critical analysis of the 
project for the 33 1/3 series, 
Jordan Ferguson calls the odd 
LP “a synthesis of everything 
[Dilla] had done to that point,” 
and it surely is a jumpy, exciting 
package of music that twirls 
its listeners around and takes 
them on a journey across genres 
and time.

But Donuts is deeper than 

that too. Dilla wasn’t just 
re-tracing his musical steps — 
he was trying to push hip-hop 
to be better, work harder and 
think longer. Dilla was one 
of the most, if not the most, 
notorious perfectionist to ever 
sample a drum loop. On Donuts, 
he spends every last bit of life 
in him, literally, reinforcing 
his musical legacy. He strives 
to define future soundscapes, 
raise his genre’s expectations 
and pen a sincere goodbye in 
his first-language of rhythms, 
all at once.

In 2005, speaking publicly 

on Donuts for the only know 
time before his death, J. Dilla 
said: It’s just a compilation of 
the stuff I thought was a little 
too much for the MCs. That’s 
basically what it is, ya know? 
Me 
flipping 
records 
that 

people really don’t know how 
to rap on but they want to rap 
on.”

Though 
some 
modern 

rappers may be capable of 
facing his challenge (imagine 
Kendrick 
Lamar 
rapping 

over “The People”!?!), Donuts 
remains as enticing, difficult 
and inspiring as ever, more 
than ten years later, in its exact 
original format.

I can only hope that, should 

my days ever become numbered, 
I might respond to the news 
with the bravery and tenacity 
of James DeWitt Yancey.

Rest in beats, J. Dilla. You 

truly were a great one.

Remembering unknown

Local singer achieved cult status through talent and tragedy

If you run a Google search DJ 

Holiday you get a bunch of hits 
for a C-list rapper and maybe, if 
the algorithm works just right, 
something about a Detroit singer. 
DJ Holiday was a phenom with one 
of those warm, room-filling, larger-
than-life voices. She was a regular 
at Bert’s Market Place Jazz Club 
singing with the RGB Trio during 
Thursday open Mic nights.

Holiday was found dead in 

a home in West Detroit earlier 
this week. The singer had been 
squatting in the property and 
presumably 
froze 
to 
death, 

although the official cause of death 
was ruled a heart attack, after the 
heating was cut off.

She started singing publically 

in Detroit in the ’60s at the Black 
Horse Saloon, but had been singing 
since childhood. Sixteen years 
ago she started singing at Bert’s 
in Eastern Market, when she met 
longtime friend Bill Meyer who she 
called her “Piano Man.”

“She struck everybody right 

away as a unique person,” Meyer 
said of Holiday, “She was a really 
beautiful soul.”

Meyer worked with Holiday on 

Before I Go, her first, and only CD. 
He developed the idea for the CD 
last year as a way to help Holiday 
make money. She told Meyer that 
before she met him she had never 
made any money singing.

Holiday had also recently caught 

the eye of French filmmaker 

Arno Bitschy, who made the 
documentary 
“Reslience.” 
The 

documentary 
focuses 
on 
the 

triumphs and struggles of the city 
from the declaration of bankruptcy 
to the mayor’s State of the City 
speech in 2015. Holiday was 
featured on the film’s soundtrack 
alongside other Detroit musicians.

After “Resilience” premiered, 

Bitschy 
turned 
his 
attention 

to Holiday in particular. The 
filmmaker had been working on 
a documentary about Holiday’s 
life and had recently extended an 
invitation to Holiday to sing at the 
film’s Paris premiere. It would have 
been Holiday’s first trip outside the 
country.

“Everything was new to her,” 

said Meyer noting the tragic timing 
of the singer’s death, “she was on 
her way up.”

The tragedy is exactly the sort of 

stuff legend is made of. But Holiday 
herself was grounded in reality.

“She was real, she was painfully 

real,” Meyer said, “Her singing 
was honest and real. She wasn’t 
pretentious or affectatious. And 
her emotions were direct.”

She 
was 
straightforward. 

She kept her eyes open, making 
eye contact with her audience 
throughout her sets, avoiding the 
sort of eyes-closed arm-waving 
that characterizes many Jazz 
singers. DJ Holiday was known 
for singing soulful ballads and had 
a deep connection to the music of 
Billie Holiday, whose life mirrored 
her own in many ways. She lived a 
hard life, full of the sorts of things 
that should trample the human 

spirit—poverty, loss, abuse. But, at 
least in song, she soared. Holiday 
created a community around her 
voice

“That’s her story, she sang like 

Billie and emulated Billie.”

Dave Tollington, a former senior 

VP at Warner Music in Toronto 
started coming across the river 
seven years ago and eventually 
found his way to Bert’s, where he 
met Holiday. He ended up helping 
Meyer with parts of Before I Go.

“She 
used 
to 
sit 
by 
the 

washrooms, sort of behind the 
stage by herself,” Tollington said of 
Holiday, “She was just mesmerizing 
and the next time I came it was my 
birthday and a friend asked if she 
would sing “Don’t Explain,” a Billie 
Holiday song, and she sang that one 
straight at me. I literally had tears 
going down my face it was that 
powerful.”

After that song he asked Holiday 

to join his table. He quickly 
became fascinated by her story 
and logged hours of tapes of their 
conversations. Like many people 
that found themselves within 
range of her voice, Tollington was 
drawn in by Holiday’s authenticity.

“She was one of hundreds of 

singers, but for me she was the 
on,” Tollington said, “How real she 
was.”

Friends will be gathering at 

Bert’s Thursday night at 8:30 P.M. 
to celebrate the singers life. There 
will also be a formal memorial 
service 
in 
March 
when 
her 

documentary is premiered in the 
United States.

The T-shirt conundrum

DETROIT VS. EVERYBODY

Popular Detroit t-shirt shown above

New York vs. Everybody? 

Chicago 
Hustles 
Harder? 

Though they say imitation is 
the highest form of flattery, 
let’s just put it out there: 
Detroit did it first.

Over the course of the 

city’s recent history, Detroit 
aficionados have moved from 
the simple calligraphy “D” 
to shirts emblazoned with a 
profusion of slogans: Made 
In Detroit in 1991, Detroit 
Hustles 
Harder 
in 
2007 

and finally, the ubiquitous 
Detroit vs. Everybody in 2012. 
The variety of merchandise 
quickly expanded from simple 
tees to coasters, keychains 

and everything in between, 
each printed with the quippy 
slogan of their specific brand. 
Though 
one 
could 
easily 

argue 
that 
the 
Pinterest-

friendly products are merely 
a byproduct of gentrification, 
the 
popularity 
they 
have 

garnered cannot be denied.

In 2014, unofficial Detroit 

ambassador Marshall Mathers 
(AKA Eminem — can’t believe 
I have to say that) released 
a 
single 
titled 
“Detroit 

vs. 
Everybody,” 
drawing 

direct 
inspiration 
from 
a 

phenomenon that started as a 
mere article of clothing. The 
song features fellow Detroit 
musicians Big Sean, Danny 
Brown, DeJ Loaf, Royce da 
5’9” and Trick Trick, paying 
homage to the slogan in its 

repeated hook. The phrase 
itself may not literally mean 
much, but that’s not what 
matters. What does matter 
is the notion that Detroit has 
served as a model for other 
great cities. Sure, they may 
be copying a mere T-shirt, but 
the idea that Detroit has had 
aspects worth imitating has 
been alarmingly obsolete for 
the last several decades.

This is not an ode to 

gentrification, but rather an 
acknowledgement of Detroit 
as a shining new archetype of 
city pride.

Calm 
down, 
New 
York 

and Chicago. But thanks for 
reminding Detroit that it is 
worthy of emulation. Just wait 
until you see what else we have 
up our novelty T-shirt sleeves.
