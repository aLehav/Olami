Big Ten university leaders — 

including University of Michigan 
President Mark Schlissel — used 
a private network exempt from 
public record laws to communicate 
about fall COVID-19 outbreaks 
on campus and the 2020 football 
season, 
the 
Washington 
Post 

reported Friday. 

Through 
public 
records 

requests, The Washington Post 
accessed 
emails 
between 
the 

chancellors and presidents of Big 
Ten universities. In these emails 
university officials asked to move 
their discussions to the Big Ten 
portal, a platform hidden from the 
public eye.

“Just FYI — I am working 

with Big Ten staff to move 
the 
conversation 
to 
secure 

Boardvantage web site we use for 
league materials. Will advise,” 
Schlissel wrote in an email to 

other Big Ten chancellors and 
presidents. 

Though each individual Big Ten 

university is subject to Freedom 
of Information Act laws, the 
conference as a whole represents 
a private, third-party entity not 
required to share their records. 

Despite a football season ridden 

with COVID-19 outbreaks and 
forced game cancellations, The 
Washington 
Post 
was 
unable 

to find evidence of significant 
discourse involving both coaches 
and 
administrators. 
There 
is 

no indication as to why Big Ten 
leaders reversed their original 
decision to cancel the season. 

Instead, from an exchange 

of emails from August 2020, 
The Washington Post identified 
university leaders expressing their 
shared concern to not disclose any 
information to the public. 

“Mark (Schlissel) and others 

— please note that anything that 
arrives in or is sent from my 
email can be requested as a public 

record. I know I’m not the only one 
for whom this is true,” University 
of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor 
Rebecca Blank wrote. 

In a direct private email back 

to Blank, Schlissel responded 
by suggesting they delete their 
emails. 

“becky, if you simply delete 

emails after sending, does that 
relieve you of FOIA obligations? 
I share your concern of course,” 
Schlissel wrote.

According to The Washington 

Post, there is not significant 
evidence that implies either Blank 

or Schlissel acted on this idea and 
deleted their communications. As 
Blank then informed Schlissel, 
the Freedom of Information Act 
prohibits 
public 
leaders 
from 

permanently 
deleting 
their 

messages. 

The Washington Post requested 

the release of all emails, including 
those 
sent 
over 
the 
private 

platform, but was unsuccessful, 
as 
university 
representatives 

said they belong to the Big Ten 
Conference. Many Freedom of 
Information Act experts, including 
David Cuillier, associate professor 
at University of Arizona, and 
Chip Stewart, professor at Texas 
Christian University, said these 
communications between public 
leaders on a third-party server 
can still be accessed by the public 
under the Freedom of Information 
Act.

Additionally, 
senior 
staff 

attorney 
at 
the 
Reporters 

Committee for Freedom of the 
Press and Freedom of Information 

Act expert Adam Marshall said 
to the Post he believed it was 
“troubling and wrong” for public 
leaders to try and evade public 
information laws in this way. 

In an email to The Michigan 

Daily Friday afternoon, University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald wrote 
Schlissel uses several different 
means of communication with 
colleagues, and the conversations 
in question were not moved to the 
Big Ten portal.

“U-M President Mark Schlissel 

regularly 
communicates 
with 

the presidents of other Big Ten 
universities in a variety of ways 
on many topics,” Fitzgerald wrote. 
“President Schlisel notes that this 
was simply a conversation among 
colleagues trying to help each 
other by sharing information on 
how to navigate a novel, shared 
challenge – COVID-19 on campus.”

Big Ten university leaders used private, third-party 
platform to discuss fall reopening, football season

U-M President Mark Schlissel asked staff to move communications to keep them hidden from public eye

MADDIE FOX/Daily & ALEC COHEN/Daily 

University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel and other Big Ten university leaders 
communicated through a private network exempt from public record laws about campus 
COVID-19 outbreaks and the 2020 football season.

Schlissel: Well-being days 
don’t ‘solve the problem’
Announcements on Fall 2021 semester expected mid-March

The Michigan Daily sat down with 

University President Mark Schlissel 
March 2 to discuss the University of 
Michigan’s fall planning, well-being 
days and sexual misconduct processes. 
This interview has been edited and 
condensed for clarity.

Mark Schlissel: Things are 

actually going well now and the 
number of cases are coming down 
all across the country. The number 
of student cases are coming down, 
and staff and faculty (cases) have 
remained low. So, I just want to 
compliment and thank everybody 
for continuing to put up with the 
incredibly disrupted lifestyle for 
the sake of keeping as many people 
healthy until we can vaccinate 
everybody. I’m more optimistic now 
than I’ve been at any point in the last 
year. 

We’re 
also 
getting 
good 

compliance with the mandatory 
testing. Basically all of the dormitory 

students are complying, and then 
many off-campus students. We’re up 
to about 21,000 tests a week, and the 
percentage positive is quite low — it’s 
below 1% positive. As it gets warmer, 
it’s going to be easier too, as we’ll be 
able to spend more time outdoors, 
and it’s safer outside.

TMD: It’s common nowadays 

in college classes for students to 
be asked by their professors or 
instructors to self-evaluate their 
performance. As U-M’s President, 
what grade would you give yourself, 
out of 10, for your response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic now a year 
into it — especially when compared 
to other institutions of higher 
education?

MS: What we’re talking about 

is actually a group project — it’s not 
an individual project. It involves the 
leadership of the campus, our medical 
and public health experts, our faculty, 
our staff and then all of you. It’s not a 
project where any one person can be 
responsible or do it alone. 

We’ve 
had 
some 
successes, 

and other things haven’t gone as 
well. So, amongst the good news is 
students are progressing towards 
their degrees. Our enrollment is 

normal enrollment. Students whose 
families have run into difficulty, 
we’ve been able to help them stay in 
school by providing special financial 
aid. Our health system has done 
spectacularly well. We’re the largest 
public research university in the 
country that was shut down during 
the height of the epidemic, but we 
ramped up again. Our labs are at 75% 
capacity now, and we’ve published 
over 1,000 papers on COVID; so, a 
lot of things in that area are going 
well. Our public health experts are 
advising the state government — all 
of the government’s plans are based 
on our expertise — that feels good. 

The challenge is there have been 

lots of student cases in particular. 
When we do the tracing of those 
cases, the overwhelming majority 
are due to contacts being made 
off 
campus, 
usually 
in 
social 

circumstances, too high density and 
not being as rigorous about masks. I 
wish we had fewer cases, but we’ve 
only had two (brief) hospitalizations, 
so I’m glad that no one’s taken more 
seriously ill amongst our student 
community.

‘U’ ends hiring, salary freezes 

for fiscal year 2022

Board of Regents to vote on reinstating merit raise program at June meeting

Starting July 1, the University 

of Michigan will end its year-
long hiring freeze and employees 
will be once again eligible for a 
merit raise program, after the 
University halted both programs 
last April in response to lost 
revenue caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic. The Board of Regents 
will vote on reinstating these 
programs at their June meeting.

At the University’s weekly 

COVID-19 briefing on Feb. 26, 
Provost Susan M. Collins said the 
University’s financial situation is 
strong despite being dependent 
on how much money the state of 
Michigan allocates it in 2022. Last 
month, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
announced that the state budget 
would offer a 2% increase for 
Michigan’s 
public 
universities 

relative to the previous fiscal year.

“2021 total application volume 

is actually up about 26 percent 
compared to 2020,” Collins said. 
“Our current enrollment remains 
steady. The financial position of 
the University of Michigan has 

also stabilized.”

But 
Collins 
said 
the 

University’s finances will remain 
constrained as units such as 
University Housing and Michigan 
Athletics continue to suffer from 
lost revenue. Despite that, she 
said, the University is prioritizing 
efforts to support faculty and staff 
affected by the pandemic.

Collins 
also 
said 
a 
merit 

increase program for faculty will 
be implemented for the upcoming 
fiscal year after the 2020 program 
was scrapped due to the pandemic.

William McAllister, executive 

manager for transportation and 
waste management, told The 
Michigan Daily that the merit 
increase program reaffirmed his 
confidence in the University’s 
financial situation.

“To 
hear 
Provost 
Collins 

mention that there’s going to 
be some sort of modest merit 
increase… 
further 
solidified 

the feelings I had about (the 
University’s financial position),” 
McAllister said. “It just shows 
what we did as employees… 
(that) made a huge difference 
financially for the University, 
and I think a lot of people look at 

this as, ‘hey, we did our part,’ and 
now the University is going to do 
their part by reinstating the merit 
program.”

In an email to Michigan 

Medicine staff published in the 
University 
Record, 
Marschall 

Runge, executive vice president 
for medical affairs, said the 
hospital would reinstate several 
of its own benefits programs, 
including paid time off, merit and 
competitive pay raises, tuition 
reimbursement and departmental 
professional 
development 

programs. Michigan Medicine 
restarted its retirement match on 
Jan. 1.

“You have played a critical role 

in helping Michigan Medicine 
return to routine operations and 
a stable and positive financial 
outlook for the current fiscal 
year,” Runge wrote to hospital 
employees. 
“Thank 
you 
for 

your ongoing commitment to 
our mission of advancing care 
for Michigan and the world, 
especially during the peaks and 
valleys of COVID-19.”

Second lawsuit against U-M OIE director 
alleges mishandling of Title IX case 

while at University of Nebraska

First suit accused Tamiko Strickman of violating sex discrimination and civil rights law at UNL

Another lawsuit was filed Feb. 

28 against Tamiko Strickman, 
associate vice president of the 
University of Michigan’s Office of 
Institutional Equity, alleging she 
and other University of Nebraska-
Lincoln personnel mishandled 
a student’s sexual misconduct 
report. The first lawsuit, filed in 
July 2020, accused Strickman of 
violating sex discrimination and 
civil rights law at UNL. 

The 
July 
2020 
lawsuit 

also 
states 
that 
Strickman 

was terminated from UNL in 
December 2019, a claim that 
both 
University 
of 
Michigan 

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald and 
UNL spokesperson Leslie Reed 
denied to The Daily in July. The 
suit names nine current or former 
UNL students as plaintiffs.

Strickman did not respond to 

The Daily’s request for comment 
in time for publication. 

Strickman previously served 

as the UNL interim Title IX 
coordinator and director of the 
UNL 
Office 
of 
Institutional 

Equity 
and 
Compliance, 
but 

she left in 2019 under disputed 
circumstances. 

The February lawsuit, filed 

by 
Title 
IX 
lawyers 
Karen 

Truszkowski 
and 
Elizabeth 

Abdnour, details a new set of 
allegations against Strickman and 
other UNL personnel for their 
handling of a former graduate 
student’s 
report 
of 
alleged 

harassment. The student alleges 
that a professor harassed her 
while she was enrolled in a Ph.D 
program at UNL. A copy of the 
lawsuit was obtained by The Daily.

The new lawsuit states the 

student experienced “numerous 
violations of her rights” in UNL’s 

reporting 
and 
investigation 

process. Strickman is specifically 
accused of pressuring the student 
to drop her case, making false 
statements about the investigation 
to the student and ignoring 
the student’s questions about 
the investigation, among other 
allegations.

“When Plaintiff went to the 

IEC (Institutional Equity and 
Compliance) office to check on 
the status of her case, Strickman 
made Plaintiff feel like she was the 
harasser rather than the victim,” 
the lawsuit reads. “Strickman 
would speak to Plaintiff in an 
angry tone that made Plaintiff feel 
like she was wasting her time.”

The unnamed plaintiff in the 

Feburary lawsuit was a graduate 
student at UNL from 2014 to 2017. 
She alleges that her unnamed 
faculty adviser, referred to as John 
Roe in the court filings, kissed her 
on the lips in his office without her 

consent. She was 26 years old and 
married at the time of the alleged 
incident; he was over 60. 

After she attempted to limit 

interactions with him after the 
incident, she alleges he started a 
“retaliation campaign” against 
her to limit her interactions with 
other instructors, increase her 
financial dependence on him 
and humiliate her in front of her 
colleagues. 

The alleged romantic advances 

also escalated from there, the 
lawsuit states.

In what the lawsuit describes as 

the “worst” instance of retaliation, 
the professor allegedly demoted 
the student from first to second 
author on a research paper without 
giving her prior notice, a decision 
which compromised her ability to 
fulfill degree requirements.

During 
the 
investigation, 

which took place during the 
summer of 2016, the plaintiff’s 

primary points of contact were 
Strickman 
and 
fellow 
UNL 

IEC 
employee 
Susan 
Foster, 

according to a letter to the 
student mentioned in the lawsuit 
that was signed by Strickman. 
Following the conclusion of the 
investigation in August 2016, a 
no-contact directive was put in 
place between the student and 
professor. 

The 
student 
alleges 
the 

harassment from the professor 
did not stop, leading her to file 
a second report with IEC in 
October 2016. According to the 
lawsuit, no investigation was 
opened into the second complaint. 
This led the student to transfer to 

another university and begin her 
program again there.

“Plaintiff had been hopeful 

that UNL would protect her from 
Roe’s harassment and retaliation, 
but her faith in the school had 
been completely broken,” the 
lawsuit reads.

In an email to The Daily March 

1, Abdnour, one of the Title IX 
lawyers on the case, wrote that 
the new lawsuit has much in 
common with the July 2020 one, 
as 
both 
reveal 
discrepancies 

between UNL’s policies and their 
practices.

Phoenix, a secret society at U-M, 
votes to disband permanently

Organization discontinues as another society Order of Angell considers potential dissolvement 

CAMPUS LIFE

BROOKE VAN HORNE

Daily Staff Reporter

Phoenix, a co-ed secret society at 

the University of Michigan, voted to 
discontinue their organization on 
Feb. 21, according to a statement by 
the current Phoenix class obtained 
by The Daily March 1. The society, 
which formerly went by the name 
Adara, has been in existence since 
1979.

Senior 
Phoenix 
members 

usually “tap” students in their 
junior year to join the society for 
the upcoming academic year. This 
year, however, they voted “by an 
overwhelming majority” to forego 
that responsibility after months of 
studying the organization’s history 
and debating its future, according to 
the statement. 

“Though we make no judgments 

on Adara / Phoenix’s past, we do 
not believe that we have a future to 
play on this campus,” the statement 
reads. “This decision was not taken 
lightly by our class, nor was it made 
out of convenience.” 

According to their statement, 

Adara/Phoenix was formed after a 
Title-IX complaint was filed against 
Michigamua — now known as 
Order of Angell — the University’s 
previously male-only secret society. 
Phoenix aimed to give women 
leaders on campus a space for 
support and empowerment and was 
founded on principles of “character, 
achievement, leadership, loyalty and 
service,” according to the statement, 
as Order did not accept female 
members until 2000. 

“When we were first tapped for 

Phoenix almost a year ago, we were 
told that ‘P’ was what we made of 
it,” the statement reads. “The only 
purpose of our organization was 
to anonymously improve campus 
through our roles as campus 

leaders. We were to launch our 
own projects and initiatives for the 
improvement of the University as a 
whole. We were to build friendships 
in the process, taking advantage of 
relationships that would otherwise 
not have been formed.”

In their statement, Phoenix 

also urged Order and “all other 
secret societies” at the University 
to dissolve indefinitely. Phoenix 
specified that their decision was not 
made in connection or influenced 
by Order’s “recently publicized 
outreach to it’s alumni regarding its 
future.”

The Michigan Daily obtained an 

email Feb. 23 from Order’s current 
class to the group’s alumni saying 
that the organization is considering 
disbanding 
and 
has 
already 

suspended its “tapping” process. 
The email sought feedback from 
alumni on the role the organization 
plays on campus. 

A group of Order alumni of 

color also drafted a letter on Feb. 
23 urging the organization either 
permanently disband or at the very 
least institute a series of five reforms 
due to its history of appropriating 
Native American culture and claims 
of a continued hostile environment 
for members of color. According to 
the letter, “race-based aggression 
was assumed to have been limited 
to ‘the past,’ even while racialized 
power dynamics continued to shape 
the day-to-day of the organization.”

The extent of Order’s misuse of 

Indigenous artifacts and culture 
was brought to light in February 
2000 when protestors from the 
Students of Color Coalition occupied 
the seventh floor of the Union, the 
organization’s former meeting place, 
for more than a month. According to 
The Daily’s reporting at the time, 
two other secret societies also met 
in the tower, and the new Phoenix 
statement acknowledged that Adara 

was one of them.

“Adara occupied the upper floors 

of the Michigan Union’s tower 
alongside Michigamua in what 
was known as the Tower Society,” 
Phoenix’s statement reads.

In 2006, Michigamua went 

through 
a 
series 
of 
reforms, 

including changing its name to 
Order of Angell, a tribute to the 
University’s former president James 
B. Angell. This choice has also been 
criticized, since it went against 
the wishes of the Angell family 
and Angell himself negotiated the 
Angell Treaty of 1880 that restricted 
Chinese immigration to the US. 

In Fall 2019, racial justice groups 

at the University — including 
the 
United 
Asian 
American 

Organizations, La Casa and the 
Arab 
Student 
Association 
— 

released statements condemning 
Order and all other secret societies 
at the University. The Michigan 
Daily voted to prohibit any of its 
editors from joining Order or any 
other exclusive senior honor society 
on Feb. 7 — this vote came before 
The Daily was aware that Order was 
considering disbanding. 

In their statement, Phoenix 

pointed to the cognitive dissonance 
that BIPOC members and potential 
members feel in joining their 
organization and discussed what 
they called “the inherently elitist” 
nature of all secret societies on 
campus.

“We 
believe 
that 
our 

organization’s mandate of ‘campus 
leaders’ 
as 
a 
prerequisite 
for 

membership is inherently elitist,” 
the statement reads. “Leadership 
roles are obtained through and 
sustained by privilege. The meaning 
of this phrase has never been 
defined. In reality, each class of 
Phoenix is tapped by friends in 
previous 
classes, 
compounding 

issues of elitism and homogeneity 

that 
have 
long 
plagued 
our 

organization.”

A BIPOC Phoenix member of 

the class of 2021 — who remains 
anonymous in the statement for 
fear of professional retribution — 
wrote that joining the club raised 
ethical concerns for them and made 
them question their place in the 
organization.

“It is weird and discouraging to 

have to think, ‘Am I joining a racist 
club?’” they wrote. “It is even more 
unnerving to be actively told while 
being recruited that Phoenix is 
not racist. I did and still do believe 
that Phoenix is not a racist society. 
However, it is modeled after one and 
I think that it is time to realize that 
distinction.”

Suzanne Saunders Hecker, a 

1989 University and Phoenix alum, 
wrote in an email to The Daily 
that Phoenix alumni are “deeply 
saddened” upon learning that the 
current class has decided to disband 
the organization.

“Adara/Phoenix 
has 
helped 

the 
leadership 
path 
of 
many 

underserved and underrepresented 
constituencies at the University 
of 
Michigan,” 
Hecker 
wrote. 

“The current classes of students 
on campus are struggling with 
enormous social upheavals in our 
nation and world and are trying 
to be as responsible as possible in 
this environment. We respect the 
time and care that these seniors 
took in making their decision. 
We look forward to reflecting 
on our experiences within the 
organization. We will strive to 
listen and continually learn to 
better understand the University 
of Michigan students, leaders, and 
community.”

Civil rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson announced 
as Spring 2021 commencement speaker

Author of ‘Just Mercy’ will address graduates during virtual ceremony

ALEC COHEN/Daily

The University of Michigan announces civil rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson as this year’s commencement speaker 
(NOTE: This photo was taken at the 2018 Spring Commencement, before the COVID-19 pandemic).

Bryan Stevenson, notable civil 

rights lawyer and social justice 
activist, will give the commencement 
address 
during 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan’s 
virtual 
Spring 

Commencement Ceremony on May 
1, the University Record announced 
Thursday morning. 

Stevenson 
has 
worked 
to 

exonerate prisoners on death row 
for more than 30 years and is a 
bestselling author. His memoir, “Just 
Mercy,” was adapted as a motion 
picture in 2019, where actor Michael 
B. Jordan portrayed Stevenson.

Stevenson is also the founder 

and executive director of the Equal 
Justice Initiative, which provides 
legal representation to prisoners who 
have been wrongfully convicted, 
improperly sentenced or abused 
while imprisoned. 

Through his work with the Equal 

Justice Initiative, Stevenson has 
won major legal battles to overturn 
wrongful sentencing. During his 
time with the nonprofit, he has saved 
more than 135 wrongfully convicted 
prisoners from the death penalty. 

In 2012, Stevenson successfully 

brought a case before the U.S. 
Supreme 
Court 
in 
which 
he 

argued mandatory life sentences 
for juveniles convicted of murder 
without the opportunity for parole 
was in violation of the Eighth 
Amendment. 

This announcement comes one 

month after the University said a 
virtual ceremony would be held 
for the Class of 2021 rather than 
an in-person event. The virtual 
ceremony is slated to include student 
performances 
and 
speakers 
in 

addition to the conferring of degrees.

The University also released 

information Thursday for graduates 
regarding various socially-distanced 
photo sessions at Michigan Stadium. 
The photo sessions are set to begin 

April 6, and graduates will be able to 
have free professional photographs 
taken with other graduating friends 
and classmates. 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlisssel told the Record the 
decision to hold photo opportunities 
in Michigan Stadium is a result of 
feedback received from graduating 
students. Since the confirmation 
of virtual commencement, some 
students and families have pushed 
the University to try for a safe 
in-person commencement event.

“We’ve heard from them that 

they want inspiring commencement 
speakers and the opportunity to have 
a celebration in Michigan Stadium,” 
Schlissel said in the press release. 
“We created our photo event in the 
Big House and invited influential 
leaders to share their message and 
make this spring special for our 
graduates.”

CAMPUS LIFE

So, I think when this is all over 

and behind us, I think we should 
really take stock and see how we did. 
It’s almost like the grading system 
that’s in effect now for students, 
right? You get to wait till you have 
your grades to know whether you 
should take a grade or a pass/fail, so 
maybe I’ll wait until we have a little 
bit more perspective, but it’s really 
a group project; and I appreciate 
everybody who’s been helping.

TMD: In a recent tweet, Regent 

Jordan Acker (D) said, “I hope Dr. 
Fauci is right that every American 
can get a vaccine by July … That 
would go a long way toward getting 
back to the Michigan experience 
we all love.” You’ve said that the 
University is looking at scenarios 
based on what fraction of the 
campus community is vaccinated. 
Can you walk us through some 
of those scenarios? What’s the 
difference between if, say, 60% and 
90% are vaccinated?

MS: I think what’s most likely is 

that by the time the summer rolls 
around, all of the faculty and staff 
that want to be vaccinated will 
have that access to the vaccine. 
But, when the new school year rolls 
around, probably not more than 
half of students will be vaccinated. 
So we’ve got to figure out how to 
have as much in-person education 
and student life as possible. So it 
could be the semester will begin 
more constrained and become less 
constrained as time goes by, but 
those are the plans we’re working 
on now. 

And what we’re doing in the last 

couple of weeks and then the next 
week or two is talking to faculty, staff 
and students and learning about 
what they’d like the fall semester to 
look like. The Regents are weighing 
in; parents are weighing in. The 
best of all possible worlds would be 
everybody, including all students, 
who want to be vaccinated to have 
been vaccinated by the fall semester. 

And I think when we get to 

that stage, campus might be quite 
normal. For sure we’ll get to the 
stage eventually where there aren’t 
masks; you can have football games 
and big classes. I don’t think we’ll be 
quite there in the fall, but I think it’ll 
be a good part of the way there.

TMD: If much of the class 

instruction remains online, how 
does U-M plan to combat virtual 
fatigue from students, as the end of 
the fall semester would mark nearly 
two years of almost entirely online 
instruction?

MS: I think no matter what 

state we’re in, there’ll be more 
activities on campus for students to 
participate in, and not just virtual 
activities. If we have to continue 
to be conservative, we would still 
wear masks, but we do things 
together; we start to get people out 
of their rooms. I can’t predict yet 
what percentage of classes will be 
in person, but it’s very likely to be 
much more in person than it is now. 

TMD: Rich Holcomb from U-M 

Human Resources shared poll 
results on Feb. 12 that said 87% of 
Ann Arbor staff would be interested 
in continuing to work remotely 
after the pandemic. Three days 
later, Public Affairs tweeted that 
U-M remains optimistic that the 
fall semester “will be more normal.” 
Given this juxtaposition, do you 
expect there to be conflict between 
staff/faculty and administrators 
if you choose to introduce a more 
in-person fall semester plan? If so, 
how will you handle it?

MS: The survey that vice 

president Holton was talking about 
was for a significant number of 
back-office staff at the University 
that 
aren’t 
face-to-face 
with 

students. Our staff that deals with 
students, such as student affairs 
people, the Student Life folks and 
the faculty of course — we’re a 
residential, in-person higher-ed 
institution — and they’re going to 
do their jobs. 

That said, I do think there are 

going to be reentry challenges for 
people as they come back to work. 
Just like you’ve been studying 
remotely a lot and you’ve got Zoom 
fatigue, a lot of our faculty and staff 
have been working remotely for a 
long time. We have to do everything 
we can to convince people that 
they’re safe on campus. 

TMD: Given that classes are 

entirely asynchronous for many 
students and that we live in 
an unprecedented time where 
the 9-to-5 work week has been 
completely disturbed, do you feel 
that “well-being breaks” make a real 
improvement to students’ mental 
health? If you were a student, would 

you feel like this is enough to make 
a difference?

MS: I think for many people it 

was a welcomed day not to have 
to take class and not to have to 
Zoom. By itself, no, it doesn’t solve 
the problem. But it recognizes that 
there are little things we can do to 
make things marginally better, at 
least for a little while.

One thing that I learned relatively 

early in the pandemic which 
surprised me is students said that 
many of their classes are actually 
harder than they are when you’re 
doing regular classes in person. 
The workload seems greater, there 
seems to be more tests and more 
quizzes. I talked to faculty about 
this, and they said they needed to be 
sure students were keeping up and 
paying attention when they couldn’t 
see you. So we’ve tried to give 
feedback to the faculty to get them 
to better adjust the workload to 
reduce stress. The well-being days 
(are) just a day to give time. We’re 
not under the illusion that the well-
being days solve all our problems at 
all.

TMD: When can we expect a 

more detailed plan for the fall?

MS: In the coming couple of 

weeks. We’re working on the 
details right now, but in the grand 
scheme, we’re expecting to have 
a significantly more in-person 
fall semester with much more 
residential life and more of our 
classes in person. Hopefully we’ll be 
able to get it to you by the middle of 
the month.

TMD: In late January, the Office 

for Institutional Equity released 
two annual reports on sexual 
and 
gender-based 
misconduct, 

one looking at students and one 
looking at University employees. 
The 
student 
report 
included 

breakdowns of reported allegations 
and investigative and appellate 
outcomes (if any), whereas the 
employee report did not include 
an 
appendix 
or 
distinguish 

between assault and harassment 
in its data. Both employee and 
student misconduct affect the 
University community, and cases 
like Philbert’s and Anderson’s 
have brought attention to alleged 
sexual misconduct from employees 
in particular. Do you have any 
thoughts on the University’s attitude 
toward these two sources of sexual 
and gender-based misconduct on 

campus and/or an explanation of 
the difference in detail between the 
two public reports?

MS: I think you’re pointing out 

something that’s important that 
many of us have noticed: The nature 
of the reporting is quite different 
when it comes to student events 
as compared to faculty and staff 
events. One of the recommendations 
we got in an earlier review of our 
policies is that we should have a 
single umbrella policy that uses the 
same definitions and provides the 
same information for everybody. 
That’s what we’re in the process of 
doing; we’ll be ready to push that 
out hopefully by the summertime. 

TMD: 
Especially 
following 

the WilmerHale investigation of 
Philbert, which detailed several 
instances 
where 
allegations 

were brought forward to OIE 
and University officials but not 
thoroughly investigated, can you 
comment on this single-digit rate 
of investigation for reports against 
students and the approximate 12% 
rate of investigation for employee 
reports reflected in the two reports 
from this year? 

MS: 
When 
I 
first 
started 

reading these things, shortly after 
I got here, recognizing that sexual 
misconduct and sexual harassment 
are incredibly serious problems, 
I was surprised how few full 
investigations were done compared 
to the total number of reports. 
What I’ve learned is OIE reports 
every single report of misconduct or 
harassment. We report everything. 

The other thing that I learned is 

that investigation is only one way 
forward. There’s another pathway 
forward that involves more of a 
discussion or mediation between 
individuals where a person has 
made a complaint against another 
person. There are many people 
that just want to be heard and 
undergo some kind of process of 
accountability, and that sort of more 
restorative justice approach is being 
used and offered as an option. 

Sometimes we’ll get complaints 

that actually aren’t illegal or 
disallowed by our rules. In order for 
something to be sexual harassment, 
it has to be severe and pervasive. 
So sometimes we get a complaint 
of moderate severity, and we 
don’t ignore it. We feed back the 
information to a local leadership, 
and we try to address it. It doesn’t 
become an investigation because it 
doesn’t fall under something that’s 
disallowed by Title IX. 

When it comes to Philbert, one 

of the things that we’re trying to 
learn from the report and from the 
help that Guidepost is giving us, 
is how we can do a better job fully 
investigating reports of misconduct 
to 
prevent 
multi-year 
serial 

misbehavior. We have to look at and 
revise our procedures and make 
sure we’re not missing things. We 
have to get better at this.

TMD: 
On 
the 
website 

of 
Guidepost 
Solutions, 
the 

investigative firm hired to help 
implement 
the 
WilmerHale 

recommendations, 
they 
claim 

their goal is to “help you seize 
opportunities 
on 
the 
horizon, 

minimize disruption, or move on 
from difficulty.” What message do 
you think that sends to survivors 
of alleged sexual assault at U-M, 
and does U-M see the entire 
process as just another disruption? 

Are you committed to structural 
change when it comes to sexual 
misconduct?

MS: Well, the description you 

give is certainly not the reason 
we hired them. What they’re 
contracted to do is to help us 
implement the recommendations 
of 
the 
WilmerHale 
report. 

We’re absolutely committed to 
diminishing 
the 
frequency 
of 

misconduct and harassment to 
zero. It should never be tolerated. 
What we need their help with is 
establishing an environment where 
the people who are subjected 
to misconduct feel that their 
complaints are going to be taken 
seriously — that there won’t be 
retaliation against them. The fact 
that only a fraction of instances 
of misconduct ever gets reported 
is a huge problem. We really need 
to 
increase 
our 
community’s 

confidence that they’re going to be 
treated well and fairly. 

The other thing they’re going 

to help us with is look(ing) at our 
procedures inside of OIE and how 
we do our investigations. They’re 
not here to reinvestigate the 
Philbert matter. They’re here to 
help us make the place better and 
stronger.

TMD: The Lecturers’ Employee 

Organization is in the midst of 
bargaining for a new contract with 
the Regents. Last year, Regent 
Ron Weiser (R) sent an email to 
the entire board that disparaged 
Graduate Employees’ Organization 
picketers as probably “hired union 
hacks” and one member as “an 
idiot.” With this type of discourse 
going on behind the scenes, how 
can organized labor on campus 
believe that the University and the 
Board are negotiating with them in 
good faith?

MS: All of our employees are 

important and essential for our 
mission. The institution respects 
and values the people that work 
with us. There’s no way we could 
be outstanding in research and 
teaching and service and patient 
care without the tens of thousands 
of people that work with us. 

For example, in recent months, 

I’ve been down on South Campus at 
our transportation facility visiting 
with bus drivers and talked to 
them about their experience and 
thanked them for being frontline 
workers. In the Dow Building a 
couple months ago, I sat and visited 
with maintenance and custodial 
staff for the University and thanked 
them for working under difficult 
circumstances; 
you 
can’t 
do 

custodial work from home. 

When it comes to our organized 

workers and our unionized workers, 
we always endeavor to bargain in 
good faith. It’s incredibly important 
for both sides to believe that the 
other side is bargaining in good 
faith, otherwise the whole system 
breaks down and the University 
suffers.

TMD: In that same email, 

Weiser wrote about a GEO member: 
“While he was cleanly dressed it 
was impossible to imagine him in 
a classroom. Janitor maybe from 
the mental content.” What kind 
of message does that send to the 
University’s custodial staff and 
other frontline workers, most of 
whom have risked their health 
to work in person and keep the 
University functioning throughout 

the pandemic? 

MS: I can say the board, myself 

and the leadership of the University 
incredibly appreciate the work of 
those folks in particular. Think 
about when you come to campus 
the morning after snowfall. Those 
darn paths are all clear, and there’s 
rarely patches of ice. These folks do 
a spectacular job. They’re outside 
shoveling my driveway at five in 
the morning. I can’t even get any 
exercise; they’re out there before I 
would get out there. So, they have 
a huge amount of gratitude and 
respect from me.

TMD: February was marked 

by several virtual events around 
campus in honor of Black History 
Month. 
At 
the 
kickoff 
event 

Feb. 
1, 
one 
student 
panelist, 

LSA Student Government Vice 
President Josiah Walker, said he 
wants the University to continue 
to highlight Black history beyond 
the month of February. What is or 
will the University do to elevate its 
commitment to Black students in 
the months and years to come?

MS: I think Josiah is 100% 

correct. You pick out a month 
just to draw people’s attention. 
But we should focus on issues 
around racism, equity, Blackness 
in America, Black Lives Matter — 
almost every day of the academic 
year. 
Also 
from 
a 
research 

perspective, the Institute for Social 
Research runs a very famous 
program called the Program for 
Research on Black Americans. 
We’ve got a Center for Research on 
Ethnicity and Culture and Public 
Health, the Center for the Study 
of Black Youth in LSA and the 
National Center for Institutional 
Diversity.

We’ve worked hard, and we’ve 

only been modestly successful 
increasing representation, not just 
of African Americans, but of many 
other 
underrepresented 
groups 

on campus. In terms of studying 
Black History, I don’t think we 
understand 
American 
history 

without 
understanding 
Black 

History. The Black experience 
is the American experience in 
many, many ways, and we have to 
understand it to live together and to 
be scholars.

TMD: We know that the men’s 

and women’s basketball teams are 
both having great seasons. When 
was the last time you got out on your 
driveway — on that hoop you have 
— and shot some baskets?

MS: It was last fall before the 

weather turned. It’s often on the 
weekends, sometime in the late 
afternoon when I just have to shake 
the cobwebs out. The embarrassing 
thing is I’m 63 now, and I can 
actually just shoot baskets by myself 
and pull muscles. So, I don’t get to 
do it as much as I’d like. One of my 
bucket list things is I’d like to invite 
some of our coaches or basketball 
players to come and play some 
pickup on the driveway. So, maybe 
after the season’s over or maybe 
when they bring home a national 
championship we can play some 
hoops here at the president’s house. 
That’d be great.

The next step

The scent of my mother

I have always been waiting. When I 

was too young to be in school, I envied my 
older siblings for having math homework. 
When I was in elementary school, I woke 
up at the same time as my older siblings, 
who were in middle school and high 
school, because I wanted to make sure I 
was ready to be on the “big kid” schedule. 
When I finally got to middle school, I 
bubbled with anticipation while spinning 
the dial on my brand-new locker, but this 
excitement quickly faded; after all, high 
school was more intriguing than a locker.

By the time high school came around, I 

was determined to get into a good college 
and spent my time doing everything I 
could to prepare for that next step. Before 
I went to sleep, I imagined scenarios of 
what my life would be like on a college 
campus. I saw myself decked out in maize 
and blue at tailgates. I pictured the rush 
of being in the Big House for my first 
college football game. I fantasized about 

making new friends and bonding over 
our everlasting love for John Mulaney. 
The next night, I would be at the library 
studying for a biochemistry exam. I 
imagined nearly all mundane activities 
becoming slightly more tolerable once I 
was in college. I slept knowing that my 
dreams for the next step might just be a 
reality. I slept peacefully and with hope.

Now, as a freshman, I sit here typing 

this in my Ann Arbor apartment after 
getting kicked out of the University of 
Michigan residence halls. Though I’m 
quite literally in the place I spent four 
years dreaming about, the satisfaction 
I expected to come along with it didn’t 
come the way I imagined it would. 
Making new friends comes with the 
anxiety of COVID-19 exposure. Sleepless 
nights cramming for exams at the 
library have become me sitting at home 
alone, without friends — studying and 
coming to the bitter realization that my 
time management skills have become 
subpar. It’s far less glamorous than I had 
anticipated. Days blend into one another, 
all consisting of an endless cycle of 

homework, Zoom and staring at the four 
blank concrete walls of my apartment.

On top of it all, my constant need 

for being overly prepared for the next 
step seems to have disappeared. When 
you’re younger, the milestones are so 
clearly predetermined. You get your 
driver’s license when you turn 16 years 
old, and you pursue higher education if 
you have the means and desire to. No 
one ever mentioned how the next steps 
get fuzzier when you’re older — how, 
to a certain extent, you have to choose 
your next step. You can decide what 
the future holds for you, but now with 
the pandemic, the future is filled with 
uncertainty more than ever.

Preparing for the next step isn’t what 

it used to be. It’s no longer as simple 
as waking up at 6 a.m. instead of 8 a.m. 
It’s not as easy as spinning the dial on 
my brand-new locker. What I can do 
is learn how to be content with the 
way things are, instead of drowning in 
sorrow that things aren’t as picture-
perfect as I had imagined them to be. I 
can bring light into the seemingly dark 

four walls around me and have that be 
enough. Life appears to be at a standstill 
with the ongoing pandemic, yet the vast 
majority of people are still clinging to 
their hopes of what they want to do in the 
future. With estimates of herd immunity 
being achieved in 2022, it’s becoming 
increasingly apparent that I shouldn’t 
waste a year of my life glorifying what’s 
next. As college students, we often 
forget that we are still so rich in time. 
The ongoing pandemic makes it so easy 

for us to see how much time is slipping 
away, but we are still young in the grand 
scheme of it all. The pressure that I put on 
myself in my youth to be over-prepared 
for the next step has always been self-
inflicted. Recognizing that there is time 
to prepare at a normal rate while still 
learning to enjoy the nuances of everyday 
life is something that is more than 
achievable for me. I’ve spent so much of 
my life waiting for the next step. I’m done 
waiting.

alchemical creation concocted out of 

132 perfumes from her symphony of sweet

all fused with her natural

chemicals and last night’s kimchi stew

yet her underlying melodies

simply untraceable like the base

colors of Pollock paintings

like the diffuser of life 

she inhaled her pride while i 
spewed secrets in english:

words she would stumble upon

as she carried dictionaries of puzzles 
piling them gently despite her clogged 

filters

she exhaled only the shasta daisies 

into my lonely garden

i’m sorry umma but how can i forget 

those sighs and salty tears 

you wiped with the hands that carried 

whiffs of burnt bulgogi

hoping to conceal the embarrassment

of which i was the cause

with spritzes of patience and fresh 

nectarine blossom 

when it’s already imprinted in my 
memory and your memory foam

i now dive straight into its fluffy haven 

and kiss the nostalgic whiffs, scrambling 

for hints

that’d later haunt me like the unopened

i’m sorry umma but i needed time
to heal as my spit-out sharp-edged

Design by Erin Shi

I love learning that I’ll have the apartment 

to myself for the day. Just the words “I am 
heading out for a few hours” send endorphins 
rushing through my head because of the 
realization that I now have several hours I 
can dedicate to tidying up my apartment. The 
prospect of organizing my life by cleaning 
overtakes my mind as I start a load of laundry 
while “Neon Guts” by Lil Uzi Vert blasts 
through my speakers. 

Before I moved to college, I was a hoarder. 

If you’d taken a peek under my bed, you would 
have found my McDonald’s receipt from four 
months ago, my middle school yearbook and 
the Adidas Superstar shoebox I got with a 
shoe purchase from three years ago. But after 
discovering the inner peace I gained after 
using my own will to remove useless junk 
from my space, I changed my lifestyle from 
that of a hoarder to that of a neat freak. 

Cleaning had always been a chore to me. My 

mother taught me how to do laundry and iron 
my clothes when I was nine and clean dishes 
when I was ten. By twelve, I was hovering over 
her shoulder as she taught me how to measure 
the perfect amount of salt for any dish. With 
my Indo-Caribbean heritage, it was expected 
of me, the girl of the house, to learn to cook 

and clean from a very young age. I began to 
dread cleaning because I was required to live 
up to this cultural standard while my brothers 
would never have to fathom the idea of using a 
bucket and a mop to wipe the hardwood floors 
every Sunday morning. The scent of Clorox 
wipes and Scrubbing Bubbles Bathtub Cleaner 
attacked my lungs, choking me slowly as I 
scrubbed the dirt and grime off the bathtub 
walls. Eventually, I became Cinderella before 
she received her magical carriage, gown and 
glass slippers; my free time was spent picking 
up after my older brothers. While my brothers 
were able to laugh in the hallways as they 
got ready to go see their friends, the sound of 
water coming from the kitchen sink was my 
small companion for the weekend. 

Having to clean up after yourself and be 

responsible for the adults in your household 
is an emotionally grueling task as a child. It 
sours your perspective on cleaning because it’s 
a parent-mandated duty rather than an act of 
self-care. After moving to Ann Arbor for my 
freshman year, keeping my side of the dorm 
room clean was initially challenging. It was 
frustrating to come home to my room, with 
makeup and clothing scattered across my desk 
and my unmade bed, serving as a constant 
reminder of my terrible time management and 
sleep schedule. I felt defeated every day as I 
shoved my little black makeup bag under my 
desk and into an organizer. My eyes felt heavy 

and exhaustion washed over me, because I 
was always wondering when this cycle would 
come to an end. 

One day, I discovered Marie Kondo’s method 

of tidying, where she worked with those in 
cluttered spaces to declutter their environment 
and introduce them to a new perspective on 
cleaning. Kondo would ask people to only keep 
the items which “spark joy” in them, meaning 
that if someone held an object in their hand 
and did not feel excitement or happiness, then 
they would remove the object from their space. 
Ultimately, the purpose of the exercise was to 
declutter by getting rid of various old items and 
creating space for something new. 

After coming across the KonMari 

method of cleaning, I decided it was time 
to purge my room. I ran to my dresser, 
starting with the top drawer, and removed 
every piece of clothing one by one until they 
were heaped into a mountain on the floor. 
Band t-shirts from middle school and jeans 
from my first year of high school had all 
followed me to college. I was holding onto 
memories that I felt neither emotionally 
connected to nor thought were relevant 
to me as a freshman in college. I did not 
understand how holding onto old pieces 
of clothing could block me from reaching a 
sense of peace until I took the time to hold 
each garment in my hand and ask myself, 
“Does this spark joy?” 

Once my wardrobe no longer consisted 

of old clothing, I felt as if I had been set free 
from all the weight that had been holding 
me down. Though I was thankful for my 
past memorabilia that accompanied me 
throughout summers in New York City and 
time spent with friends, I was approaching a 
new beginning. All of a sudden, the sun looked 
brighter and the breeze came through the 
dorm windows. There was an extra skip in 
my step as I lined up my three garbage bags 
of clothes against the wall to take out. I stood 
in the middle of my room, looking at the small 
pile of clothes I had left, and smiled. Finally, 
cleaning made me feel good. 

Decluttering is now a weekly routine of 

mine. A surface can be properly cleaned 
without having to move something. A 
workplace is like a temple, so having a 
clean environment is essential. In a time 
when everything is virtual, keeping items 
that “spark joy” can keep you motivated, 
happy and focused. Nurturing your 
environment with sunlight and plants 
is a way to improve your mood and your 
point of view towards work. You deserve 
to study, work and play in a stress-free 
environment this semester, so give 
yourself a chance to fall in love with 
cleaning.

Why you should keep items that spark joy

I am a Gemini sun, Libra moon and Cancer 

rising. To people well-versed in astrology, 
these placements indicate that I am an idealist, 
easily approachable and generally easy to get 
along with, but I tend to get bored almost 
as soon as I start a conversation and cannot 
make a decision to save my life. However, most 
people, when I begin discussing the practice 
of astrology, think that I am a complete fool. 
Many people, mostly other men, dismiss 
astrology as some ridiculous practice that 
only unreasonable people, mostly women, 
believe in. This idea, of course, is narrow-
minded, condescending and misogynistic. I 
invite disbelievers to see astrology through 
the perspective of people who actually do 
take it seriously and perhaps listen to my 
account before completely disregarding the 
topic. Astrology is often the butt of many 
jokes, but it has helped me discover newfound 
confidence, form connections with other like-
minded individuals and further challenge my 
understanding of human behavior. 

In the summer of 2019, I attended a summer 

writing program in Ohio, about 4,000 miles 
away from my home in Kapolei, Hawaii. When 
I was young, I had always kept to myself in the 
back corner of the classroom. In this program, 
I was suddenly dropped into completely new 
and unfamiliar territory, surrounded by 200 
brilliant writers from all over the country. 
When I arrived, I was terrified beyond any fear 
I had ever felt before. I thought my writing and 
ideas were neither poetic nor important enough 
to share, and I found myself subconsciously 
muting my child-like fascination with fireflies 
and willow trees (neither of which existed on 
my island home) in order to fit in with my peers. 
Even when the residence hall common rooms 
echoed with laughter and excitement, my body 
tried to merge into the concrete walls — until 
an outgoing stranger named Minnie asked 
me if I knew anything about astrology. I had 
never believed in astrology before, but I was so 
desperate to make friends that I was willing to 
learn more about it just to appeal to this kind 
stranger.

She first used an online natal chart 

calculator to show me my own placements 
and help me understand how astrology 
may play a role in my own personality. For 
instance, my moon in Libra suggests that 
I strive to maintain peace in my personal 
relationships, which may lead to surrender 
during arguments. My shy nature has always 

made me despise confrontation (even now 
that I have become more confident), so 
this description was dead-on. It felt nice to 
know that Minnie was able to gather this 
information about me without me having to 
actually be vulnerable with somebody I had 
met one day prior. After doing a little more 
research on the anatomy of the natal chart, 
I found a wealth of information about all the 
even more intricate parts of astrology like 
houses, decans and Chiron: all important 
sections and celestial bodies of a natal chart 
that can be easily overlooked. 

However, simply learning more about the 

inner workings of astrology didn’t convince 
me that any of this information was worth 
learning about –– or truthful, for that matter. 
One of the biggest reasons for my skepticism 
about astrology was that it is not supported 
by scientific evidence. Even now, I recognize 
that astrology is not backed by scientific 
discovery; what does planetary orbit have 
anything to do with my character? I could 
easily find correlations between my behavior 
and the planets’ positions in my birth chart, 
such as my scattered thoughts and curiosity 
about others’ lives reflected in my mercury 
placement in Gemini. However, I still 
found no evidence to prove that these were 
more than mere coincidences, even if these 
connections seem eerily accurate. Though 
my TikTok application’s For You Page is full 
of explanations of planetary returns and 
energetic frequency, I still find concepts 
such as Mercury retrogrades and planetary 
placements illogical. So, why do I still believe 
in astrology? Well, that’s simply because I am 
not a logical person.

Irrationality is a fundamental part of 

the human experience. Astrology may 
be irrational, but so were my impostor 
syndrome and intense fears of social rejection. 
Nevertheless, these manifested in very real 
ways, and I still clung to my anxiety toward 
approaching new people. If I could believe 
one irrational theory, what was stopping me 
from believing in astrology as well? As I tried 
to wrap my head around the petroglyphic 
symbols scattered around my birth chart, 
I realized that believing the stars influence 
our personalities is no more unreasonable 
than believing that I was an unintelligent and 
unlikable person. Logically, upon having this 
realization, I could now recognize that my 
fears from before were irrational, but I was 
still afraid of judgment. In order to combat an 
irrational fear, I decided to approach it with 
another irrational belief system. I decided to 
learn more about how the astrological traits 

of the signs in my birth chart could help me 
grow.

When I read more about the traits of 

Gemini suns, I discovered that they were 
typically popular, outgoing and loved sharing 
their knowledge with others. Suddenly, I felt 
like I had the potential deep within me to 
overcome my intense fear of social rejection. 
I simply had to embrace my innate Gemini 
characteristics and grow into the person 
I was destined to be. At the same time, I 
learned that it was common for Geminis to 
frequently shift their personalities to appeal 
more easily to a wide variety of people. I 
wasn’t aware that I was shunning parts of 
myself to fit in at the time, but reading about 
it made me realize that this was a fault I 
wanted to correct. Without reading about 
the common tendencies of Geminis, I may 
never have realized that I was hiding parts 
of myself away. My birth chart never told 
me something about myself that I didn’t 
already know; it just made me confront the 
perception of myself that I never desired to 
acknowledge. I used astrology to analyze 
myself. When I confronted the shy, anxious 
parts that I wanted to change, I formed a 
clear vision of the person I wanted to be. After 
years of conscious growth and introspection, 
I am much more outgoing and expressive 
than before. I am much happier with the man 
I am today than the shy young boy I was that 
summer.

Over the course of the two-week program, 

I continued to ask Minnie about astrology and 
her journey as a writer and her dreams for 
the future. Together, we spent many hours 
editing each other’s poetry, running around 
the campus and talking until the late hours of 
the night. Two years later, she remains one of 
my best friends. Had I scoffed in her face and 
told her that astrology is irrational and fake, I 
surely would have never been able to form the 
connection that I did.

I understand why people often don’t take 

astrology seriously, but without astrology, I 
would have never formed connections with 
others who shared my interest in astrology, 
and I would not have become cognizant of the 
unique parts of myself that I repressed in order 
to assimilate. I’m not saying that everyone 
has to adopt the practice of astrology; people 
should do whatever works for them. I think 
we should all take the time to examine the 
things that we have initially dismissed as 
unimportant. Perhaps remaining open-
minded and focused on our own growth is 
more important than forming a rigid and 
perfectly rational worldview.

Raise the federal minimum wage

This past summer, I worked at an Amazon 

fulfillment center. With an “appealing” 
starting wage of $15 an hour, I forced myself 
to work 10-hour days beginning at 7 a.m. for 
four days straight, every week. This was an 
attempt to make as much money as possible 
before heading back to college in the fall. I 
worked with hundreds of workers operating 
forklifts, box cutters, tape guns and pallet 
jacks. Though the work takes a toll on 
your physical health, the $15 hourly 
wage and the ease of picking 
up shifts attract many people 
to the facility. I was just a 
broke college kid trying to 
save up some spending 
cash for the fall, but the 
majority of the workers 
were mothers, fathers, 
grandmothers 
and 

grandfathers 
working 

to make ends meet. The 
federal minimum wage 
has remained unchanged 
for over 10 years at $7.25 an 
hour, and it is essential that 
this minimum be increased to 
$15 an hour.

These 
blue-collar 
head-of-

households were some of the hardest 
working and nicest people I have met. 
Yet, working 40 hours a week at $15 per 
hour only brings home a bi-weekly check 
of $1,200. And that’s before taxes. As the 
cost of living continues to rise and more 
people cannot afford basic necessities 
such as housing and food, large trillion-
dollar corporations continue to underpay 
their workers while constantly receiving 
tax cuts from the federal government. 
My coworkers at Amazon represent 
people who were lucky enough to score 
a “high-paying” job, while many other 
Americans continue to work for even more 
substandard wages. 

Our federal government seems to have 

been heavily founded on the principles of 
Economics 101such as minimal regulation of 
the free market and “trickle-down” economic 
policy in an effort to spur economic growth. 
This economic theory refers to the idea that 

reducing taxes on wealthy corporations will 
stimulate business investment and therefore 
economic growth. But giving huge tax cuts 
to these large corporations like Amazon 
has only made the rich richer and the poor 
poorer. In fact, when looking at Reagan-era 
tax cuts for the rich, the real gross domestic 
product growth rate — a statistic showing 
how much a nation’s GDP grows from one 
year 
to 
another, 

as 

adjusted for 
inflation 

— fell to negative levels in 1991, following the 
end of his presidency. Similarly, following 
this series of tax cuts, the American working 
class experienced a decrease in hourly wage 
following a second round of corporate tax 
cuts in the 1980s. In that same vein, this 
trend continues today. Instead of mandating 
a basic living wage, our government has 
decided that they work for corporations and 
their definitions of “economy” instead of 
their constituents. The rich have never had 
to worry about facing eviction or where their 
next meal was going to come from and have 
instead worried about where to distribute 
their next tax cut: toward an increased net 
worth or to neoliberal campaign support. 
Meanwhile, millions of working-class people 

have to work long and tiring hours for most of 
their life just to afford a roof over their heads 
and food on their table.

The lack of a higher federal minimum 

wage 
also 
negatively 
affects 
already 

marginalized communities. Approximately 
42% — almost half of all U.S. workers — make 
less than $15 an hour. Of the 42%, people of 
color and women disproportionately hold 
jobs paying less than a $15 per hour wage. 
Federally uplifting the poor, especially 

those who are people of color, will create 

huge 
opportunities 
for 
upward 

mobilization 
— 
something 

already proven to be difficult 

for minorities. Increasing 

wages will better economic 

disparities 
and 
racial 

disparities by reducing 
the 
disproportionate 

number of poor people 
of color. A study done 
by 
the 
Economic 

Policy 
Institute 

found 
that 
raising 

the minimum wage 
to $15 would affect 
38.1% of Black workers 
and 33.4% of Hispanic 
workers by creating the 

opportunity for them to 

earn raises, compared to 

approximately 23% of White 
workers receiving raises. Thus, 
this policy can begin to bridge 

the economic wage gap existing across 

racial lines.

A federal minimum wage of $15 is not the 

only thing to be done to diminish economic 
inequality. Though more states have begun 
investing in the working class, the federal 
government has yet enacted a living wage 
for its working people. Increasing wages 
to $15 is key to ensuring an affordable 
living situation and will drive the economy 
upwards, advancing the welfare of the 
American people. The strong and hard-
working mothers, fathers, grandmothers 
and grandfathers I knew at Amazon were 
a small representation of working-class 
Americans. I know that any industry which 
pays below $15 has the same dedicated 
individuals who are in deserving need of a 
raise so that they can finally begin to live a 
more comfortable life.

Scallion pancakes on Sunday

Every Sunday without fail, my mom 

and I gather around the kitchen island and 
make (cong yóu bing), or Chinese scallion 
pancakes together. The flaky layers and 
simple ingredients combine to create an 
aromatic and easy-to-make dish! 
 

Ingredients (makes 2 scallion pancakes): 
1.) 2 cups all-purpose flour 
 

2.) ½ cup boiling water, 1 cup room 
temperature water 
 

3.) 2 bunches of scallions, thinly sliced 
4.) 1 tablespoon salt and extra to taste 
5.) 2 tablespoons olive oil 
 

Step 1: Making the dough

Combine the flour, water (both boiling 

and room temperature) and 1 teaspoon 
of salt together in a large bowl — order of 
ingredients added doesn’t matter! Use your 
hands to knead the dough for eight minutes, 
or until the combination forms a wet dough. 
Cover the bowl with a towel or cling film, and 
let the dough rest for around 2 hours.
Step 2: Assembling the pancake

Take the dough out of the bowl and split 

it into two even parts. Set aside one half, 
and place the other half on a lightly floured 
rolling board. Coat all sides of the dough 
with flour, and use a rolling pin to flatten the 

dough into a thin layer, keeping a circular 
shape. Sprinkle a couple pinches of salt across 
the surface of the dough.

Once the dough is shaped, use the back 

of a spoon or a cooking brush to spread a 
thin layer of olive oil on the open surface of 
the dough. The oil should cover most of the 
dough, but be sure to not let it spill over the 
edges! Then, spread your scallions evenly 
across the surface of the dough.
Step 3: Forming the pancake

Starting from the bottom edge, tightly 

roll the dough into a coil. Once the coil is 
formed, twist and press it into a spiral shape, 
firmly pressing the tail end of the coil into the 
middle of the spiral so it seals properly. Then, 
use your rolling pin to shape the dough back 
into a moderately thin circular shape.

Repeat the assembly steps with the other 

half of dough.
Step 4: Cooking the pancake

Pour a tablespoon of olive oil into a cast iron 

skillet on medium-low heat and let it sit for a 
couple of minutes. Then, place one pancake 
into the pan and cover it with a lid. The stove 
should be on medium-low heat throughout. 
Each side should take around five minutes to 
cook, but be sure to continuously monitor the 
pancake to ensure it doesn’t burn. Once you 
see the surface form a golden brown color and/
or start to form bubbles, it’s time to flip. Repeat 
with the other pancake, and serve warm!

Tarab: music’s mystical ecstasy

There are many words that are impossible 

to translate directly to English; their existence 
in one language and absence in another makes 
it difficult to ascribe a particular meaning to 
them. Tarab is one of those words. Loosely 
translated to “enchantment,” tarab is an Arabic 
word describing a deep, stirring musical 
performance that launches the audience into 
a trance-like state of ecstasy. The creation of 
tarab by an artist or musical piece is difficult 
to pinpoint. Whether it be a result of poignant, 
lilting vocals, mesmerizing riffs, stirring 
instrumentals or profound lyrics, these 
seemingly mystical components culminate to 
create an experience of mesmerization, a world 
in which all that exists is the music and the 
intense bodily response one has to hearing it.

When discussing the cultural presence 

of tarab in Arabic music, Umm Kulthum is 
almost always used as the pinnacle of such a 
phenomenon. An Egyptian diva who rose to 
fame in the mid-to-late 1900s, Umm Kulthum 
was known to bewitch her audience, rousing 
their souls in her entrancing live performances. 
With a powerful singing voice and intensive 
training in Quranic recitation, Kulthum held 
a firm command over her tone, unwavering 
and expertly controlled as it swelled into 
triumphant notes or dwindling cries. Her live 
performances can best be characterized as 
a conversation between Umm Kulthum, her 
musicians and her listeners. The audience is 
deeply immersed by the divinity of her vocals 
and the way they blend seamlessly with the 
powerful instrumentals backing her, sending 
the crowd into a delirious fit of cries and 
shouts. The spectators are steeped in rapture, 
and with every powerful waver of her voice 
or deliberately drawn-out note, they respond 
with unrestrained enthusiasm — a holy 
sermon between a preacher and her listeners.

Umm Kulthum’s live performances, and the 

tarab which she so expertly cultivated among 

her listeners, are rooted in a sense of ambiguity. 
Such profound bodily experiences engage with 
one’s mind, body and soul, and that power is 
difficult to articulate. No words I could muster 
would ever seem to do justice to the bewitching 
performances of Umm Kulthum and the 
seemingly supernatural force that fell over her 
listeners. Tarab as an experience, in traditional 
Arabic music and beyond, harbors that same 
sense of mystery. Because tarab is difficult to 
translate and is typically connotated with Arab 
musical performances, it feels like any attempt 
to neatly confine tarab to a short English 
definition falls short. 

Perhaps the experience of tarab is not 

meant to be translated or systematized at all 
— it must be felt. After all, the indescribably 
deep connection that one can have with music 
is a universal part of the human experience; 
the out-of-body euphoria that music can 
evoke is one that transcends the simplicity of 
language. As a lover of music, I know that I’ve 
experienced the peculiar magic of tarab in 
ways that cannot adequately be described by 
words. You too can probably recall a moment 
in which that ineffable force has stirred you, 
whether it be unsuspecting tears welling in 
your eyes or an explosive, nameless sensation 
rising in the pit of your stomach. Maybe it’s the 
song that comes on in the car and hurls you 
into a fit of screams with your friends as you 
all pour every ounce of your strength into the 
lyrics. It might even be the quiet lull of your 
favorite Frank Ocean song, heard with eyes 
shut and body still, unraveling you through its 
celestial beauty. 

The beauty of tarab is heightened by its 

lack of simplicity; it is more than a superficial 
engagement with the production or lyrics, 
rather it is a complete surrendering to the 
nameless, spiritual exaltation that this type 
of music demands. Though the conditions 
of tarab are difficult to explain, it moves us 
all in a way that does not need to be entirely 
understood. In its enigmatic nature lies a 
comforting sanctity: a shared, almost holy 
experience that connects us all.

Returning home to Kerala, my home 

state in India, is as exhilarating today as it 
was the first time when my parents brought 
our young family from America. I was five 
years old. I remember incessantly pestering 
my mother, asking, “Are we there yet?” 
Annoyed, she handed me a brochure with 
pictures of Kerala that captivated me. The 
greenery and the lakes were a stark contrast 
to what I witnessed in Atlanta. Instead of the 
brochure keeping me pacified for some time, 
like my mother hoped it would, it evoked 
more questions than answers: “Does this 
place have a school where they don’t give 
homework?” and my personal favorite, “Why 
is it called God’s Own Country?” Finally, my 
mother found something she could quiet 
me with. She asked me to close my eyes 
and believe that we were indeed going to 
God’s Own Country. Even now, every flight 
home carries with it the same evergreen 
brochure highlighting Kerala’s natural 
splendor and tourist attractions along with 
our grandiose slogan in big proud letters, 
“God’s Own Country.” (Tourism accounts for 
10% of its revenue but 24% of the state’s total 
employment). It always brings a smile to my 
face, as I may not believe in God anymore but 
I do believe in God’s Own Country. 

The first striking thing about Kerala is its 

peculiar color of green that dominates our 
coconut trees. I can’t claim that I’ve traveled 
the world extensively, but having seen most of 
India I can claim that no other place has our 
green. Kerala, geographically, is just north of 
the equator, but it’s in the peninsular part of 
India bordered by the Indian Ocean and the 
Arabian Sea creating an optimal climate I 
sorely miss at times in the cold of Ann Arbor. 
It would seem that the sunlight and the 
moisture — much like the ebony and ivory in 
a piano creating a symphony — interacted to 
create a sunkissed green that shimmers with 
dew drops. Every Thursday in school, I had 
the best view to witness our gifts of nature. 

My school was built prior to stringent 

ecological laws passing in Kerala. So, in 
the middle of the hustle and bustle of our 
relatively big city, there’s an expansive 
forest accompanied by a lake that offers a 
spellbinding view from the school library 
on the top floor. Every Thursday, we’d have 
to sit in the library for an hour, but no book 
in the library quite interested me like the 
view outside the window. I was captivated 
by it. I remember towards the end of tenth 
grade, on a particularly melancholy day, I 
was making my way to the library. I had just 
become aware of the fact that I’d be leaving 
Kerala for the last two years of high school. 
I knew that soon I’d have to say goodbye to 
friends who I’d met in the third grade and 
who knew me inside and out. I’d have to say 
goodbye to teachers who watched me grow 
up and, more importantly, helped me grow 

up. And so I made my way to the library — 
which was empty at the time — so that I could 
collect my thoughts. A wave of nostalgia 
hit me. The normally stern librarian saw 
something serious was going on in the back of 
my mind and let me in as long as I kept quiet. 
I sat in the same spot I had for years, but on a 
Friday and in the evening when the sun was 
setting. The sunset that day was captivating. 
An eclectic combination of different colors 
layered upon one another. There was yellow 
light emanating from the sun that gave way 
to orange that gave way to a neon-like pink 
capped off by a sky blue trying its hardest to 
stave off the night. The lake was more than 
happy to become the sky’s canvas, and the 
green of the forest had an orange sheen that 
seemed to make the light bounce off of it. I 
remember trying to create a save file of that 
image in my head, Alok don’t forget this, Alok 
don’t forget this. It was the second time in 
my life that I implored myself to never forget 
what I was witnessing. 

The first time was earlier in 10th grade 

when I visited my ancestral home in 
Thodupuzha, which directly translates to 
“the touch of a river.” A huge district in Kerala, 
Thodupuzha is a compilation of uninhabited 
forested hills, streams, lakes and a sleepy 
town which makes it a trekker’s paradise. 
It was on visits there that I interacted with 
nature in its rawest form without a defined 
path and numerous dilemmas along the 
way with no phone signal to bail us out. 
While hanging out with my cousins and 
their friends, we got wind of a cool place 
we hadn’t yet explored. Apparently, there 
was a waterfall at the start of a stream that 
joined the river that was secluded and set 
to become our spot. I continuously relented 
against visiting it, not trusting my ability to 
swim and anxious of dying from a waterfall 
fall. Huh, waterfall fall would get me on 
the news, I thought (and it’s a fun thing to 
say). Armed with a sudden stoicism about 
impending death, we made our way to the 
stream. Tarred roads gave way to concrete 
ones which gave way to mud roads that made 
the car rattle. Finally, we reached the point 

where we couldn’t continue on, as there was 
no pathway. So we got out of the car and 
made our way through a forested area with 
an inviting canopy. I call it inviting as it let 
just enough light so we could see each other, 
and it brought a coolness along with it that 
made me want to snuggle in a warm blanket. 

The acned, frail dude who suggested the 

location assured us that we’d find the spot 
just around two corners. He wasn’t lying 
when he said two corners, but he didn’t do 
us any favors by omitting how long the two 
corners were. To our shock, we found a 
relatively flat terrain getting steeper, and we 
realized we were at the foot of a hill which 
nearly depleted our morale and would have 
made us consider going back had we not 
looked back and realized that the way back 
was long as well. We persevered and got to 
the bottom of the hill, and we realized we 
would have to walk upstream before we got 
to the waterfall. The once-formidable stream 
had lulled in the summertime as it glided 

along in no rush to meet its river. We could 
now see the waterfall in its entirety, and 
it was microscopic compared to the stock 
image in my brain (of Niagara Falls), but it 
was still big enough to make us question the 
sanity in our plans to get near it. Our guide 
assured us there was a spot behind the 
waterfall that we could stand behind where 
it would be perfectly safe. So, we made our 
way through the bushy coast of the stream 
until we reached a point where we had to 
get into the water. Eventually, we got around 
the side of the waterfall. There was a sizable 
gap between the rest of the stream and the 
waterfall due to the rock structure. I joined 
the audacious members of the group who 
were standing under the plunge, and the 
water felt like a cold compress massage, or 
as if the shower had a 50% spike in its water 
pressure. With great trepidation, we made 
our way to the front of the waterfall, and I 
was asked to look up. The water here seemed 
to be devoid of any constraints or concerns.

When asked about the future of 

the newly-formed Michigan Music 
Business Club, Business junior 
Jonathan Hayman, co-founder 
and president of the club, did not 
shy from divulging all that the club 
has accomplished in its two years 
of existence. 

“This semester, we will have 

had (executives from) Amazon 
Music and Spotify, two of the 
most popular digital streaming 
platforms, speak for our club on 
behalf of the school,” Hayman 
said. “There’s not been any club in 
school history that has had that. 
There’s not been any club in school 
history that has had the president 
of the largest festival company 
(Gary Gersh) in the world speak 
(on their behalf).”

Combining the passion of a 

music fan with the unrelenting 
drive of a Ross major, the MMBC 
is here to dominate. From the 
Ross School of Business to the 
School of Art & Design to LSA, 
the membership pool is filled with 
music industry hopefuls, united in 
their drive to break into the music 
scene, as talent managers, artists, 
marketing 
executives, 
concert 

planners — you name it. 

Thanks to the diverse crew 

of members (carefully curated 
by Hayman and Business junior 
Cassie Alexe, fellow co-founder), 
the 
MMBC 
has 
a 
massive 

network that has allowed them 
to plan events with some of the 
most powerful executives in the 
industry. 
Hayman 
and 
Alexe 

began developing the group in the 
summer of 2019, when the two 
were both just rising sophomores 
at the University. At that point, 
Hayman had already gathered a 
remarkably 
impressive 
resume 

in 
the 
music 
industry 
with 

experience planning concerts and 
marketing music for some of the 
hottest acts in hip hop. 

The idea for MMBC came 

to Hayman after the success of 
rapper Safari’s “Late Night Lover,” 
a song he had helped advertise. 
He realized he had nobody on 
campus to share this moment of 
accomplishment with. Hearing 
that Alexe had also been looking to 
enter the music industry, the two 
built an organization that seeks 
to make up for the lack of a music 

business major on campus. 

“We just want to excite people 

and make them want to come to 
our events,” Alexe explained. “We 
think the best way to do that is to 
have these exciting people with 
super cool experiences come in 
and tell us what it was like working 
with Kanye. Tell us what it was 
like driving to Colorado to sit at a 
Nirvana concert and listen to them 
for the first time before signing 
them. These are such cool stories 
and it’s so intimate that everyone 
gets a lot out of it.” 

Indeed, it’s hard not to be 

impressed by the list of people 
the club has managed to secure: 
the former marketing director 
of Kanye West’s Yeezy apparel, 
a head executive from Coachella 
Music 
and 
Arts 
Festival, 

managers of artists like Nirvana, 
Soundgarden, Foo Fighters and 
The Chainsmokers. And these are 
just to name a few. 

With the availability of Zoom 

and the increased normalcy of 
over-the-computer meetings, the 
pandemic has only made it easier 
for the MMBC to bring in notable 
speakers — though, they explain, 
they had been hosting some 
meetings over FaceTime even 
before COVID-19 had reached 
campus. This, along with an 
impressive social media rollout, 
has allowed the infant group to 
continue expanding even in the 
midst of a global crisis. 

“We expect to have even greater 

turnouts for our future events 
once things are back in person,” 
Hayman said. “The club is just 
exponentially growing and we 
expect MMBC to grow into the 
biggest club that Michigan has 
ever seen.” If that sounds like a 
bold proclamation, that’s because 
it is. 

If asked why they built the 

club, Hayman and Alexe will 
tell you how important it is to 
have a passion for music and to 
build a community for those with 
like-minded goals. While this 
is undoubtedly true, make no 
mistake — the MMBC is a well-
oiled machine and their ambitions 
are trekking toward something 
bigger than a passion project. Few 
things are out of reach for these 
aspiring professionals, and if you 
are looking to one day score a job in 
the music industry, the Michigan 
Music Business Club is the place 
to be.

Traveling and living out of a 

converted Sprinter van last August, 
Art & Design senior Grace Coudal 
discovered the beauty and vastness 
of the American Southwest. With her 
friend and Art & Design class of 2020 
graduate Dante Tsuzuki, Coudal drove 
through 
Colorado, 
Utah, 
Arizona 

and New Mexico to photograph the 
sweeping landscape. 

Thousands of miles away from 

Coudal’s native Chicago, this coveted 
region of American terrain inspired 
Coudal’s 
debut 
photography 
book 

Intimately South, Intimately West, 
which 
was 
ethically 
printed 
in 

Minneapolis and released Feb. 11.

Coudal believes that embracing a 

nomadic lifestyle during the pandemic 
led her toward a deeper intimacy with 
the landscape where she traveled 

and the people she met. In a virtual 
interview with The Daily, Coudal she 
described a particular night at a Utah 
campsite. 

“The whole sky was black except 

for this sunset that was happening 
all across this mountainscape. I’ve 
literally never seen colors like that 
in my life,” she said. “When I started 
crying, I didn’t know why. It was like I 
was seeing heaven.” 

Funded by the Kelly McKinnell 

Memorial 
Scholarship 
grant 
from 

the School of Art & Design, Coudal 
launched her vision of a travel photo 
project into action. The dynamics 
of intimacy have always enamored 
Coudal. 

“Intimacy is just being blown away, 

and entranced by land that I have 
never seen. Feelings that have emerged 
that I couldn’t really even anticipate,” 
she said.

Coudal only brought 10 rolls of 35 

mm film for the month-long trip. 

“It was a very active choice to do film 

photography. I did not want to at all do 
digital. I did not want to be able to see 
the photos that I was taking. I wanted 
there to be an element of surprise,” 
Coudal said. 

Only after returning from her trip 

and scanning the film did she see the 
photos she took. 

“Photos serve as artifacts. With a 

digital photo, you can take as many 

photos as you want just to get your 
‘perfect’ shot,” Coudal said. “And 
I kind of liked that that was not an 
option.” 

Through the spontaneity granted 

through film photography and journal 
entries, her book revels in the joy of 
the unknown and unplanned, all while 
capturing an otherworldly landscape. 

Photos featuring nudity in nature, 

like people bathing in a creek, are 
included in her book as well — 
physical intimacy is a common thread 
throughout her other photography, 
as seen through Coudal’s personal 
projects like “Lusting Longer.”

Coudal speaks on the self-portrait 

series as growing out of a transformative 
time in her life when she was navigating 
her own identity as a queer femme. 
“Lusting Longer” subverts the common 
fairytale trope of a girl venturing into the 
woods; Coudal re-imagines the tale by 
reclaiming her identity through fashion 
and photography. Hauling photography 
equipment and various outfits to Nichols 
Arboretum in the early morning, Coudal 
photographed herself. 

“I was trying to reclaim myself, 

sensuality, desires and lust that I’ve 
been feeling toward people,” Coudal 
said. “It was a really meaningful project 
at that time, and I was happy with how 
it turned out.” 

Though 
she 
has 
been 
creating 

and selling zines — self-published 
work curated by images and text — 
since childhood, Coudal gravitated 
toward photography as a medium. 
The vulnerability one could capture 
through a lens enamored her. 

“You could display, entice people and 

provoke people very quickly, which I 

really liked … Trying to progress the 
world into the way that we (Coudal and 
her friends) wanted it. We wanted it to 
move it. Photography was an accessible 
way to do that,” she said. 

The 
pairing 
of 
intimacy 
and 

photography 
stems 
from 
Coudal’s 

interest in how her sexuality intersects 
with the art she creates. Informed by 
her minor in LGBTQ and Sexuality 
Studies, her senior thesis project is on 
the future of queer femme intimacy. 
Coudal said that if she wasn’t a 
photographer, she’d be a sexologist. 
The intersection of these interests led 
her to conceptualize and launch her 
startup STAA, a brand focused on sex 
education and empowerment. 

Growing up as a queer teen, Coudal 

didn’t see her sexuality reflected in sex 
education class. So, STAA was born. 
“I wanted to make a company that 
was unapologetic about talking about 
sexuality, sex, intimacy and identities,” 
she said. 

Coudal found that much of LGBTQ+ 

and studies on sexuality can be dense 
and academically challenging to read. 
In an effort to promote more accessible 
content, Coudal hopes to inform other 
young people about sex through art, 
particularly her photography. 

“It makes life confusing when you 

aren’t taught those things, or you just 
don’t feel validated or seen if you are 
like a part of those communities. … And 
so I’m trying to translate that into a 

universal language of art,” she said. 

Coudal contextualized her mission: 

“Literally less than seven percent of 
LGBTQ+ individuals were ever taught 
an inclusive sexual education in the 

United States, which is awful,” she 
said. “The brand is basically just trying 
to open these conversations, empower 
people about their own desires and their 
own intimacy.”

Coudal also hopes to add a podcast to 

STAA where she can interview guests 
about sex, desire and LGBTQ+ topics. 
By broaching especially sensitive topics 
that can be really difficult and sensitive, 
such as sexual and gender identity and 
sexual intimacy, Coudal finds that 
having her photography online helps 
others feel validated and seen. 

“There are so many things that are 

perfectly normal and amazing that 
people need to feel validated about and 
need to feel empowered about,” Coudal 
said. “They shouldn’t just feel validated 
— they should be celebrated for being 
themselves.”

It is always exciting to get a look 

behind the curtain. In R.J. Cutler’s 
(“Belushi”) new documentary, “Billie 
Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry,” 
he lifts the veil on the pop icon, who 
turns out to be just another teenager. 
In 140 minutes, Cutler mixes concert 
videography, 
home 
video 
and 

backstage footage of Eilish’s life to tell 
the story of superstardom. 

As the documentary tracks the 

conception and recording of her 
debut studio album — When We All 
Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? — 
the viewer is let into Eilish’s inner 
sanctum. Now 19 years old, Billie 
was only 15 at the beginning of the 
documentary and 18 when she swept 
the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, 
becoming the youngest ever to win in 
several categories. 

While pop newcomers like Olivia 

Rodrigo and Conan Gray have drawn 
comparisons to Taylor Swift and 
Lorde, the documentary positions 
Eilish’s predecessor as … Justin 
Bieber? Starting with a call from 
a manager about Bieber’s interest 
in collaborating and ending with 
a 
congratulatory 
FaceTime 
call 

backstage at Eilish’s 2020 Grammy 
sweep — one throughline is Eilish’s 
intense adoration, not necessarily of 
Bieber’s music, but of the artist himself. 
Still, after meeting him at Coachella, 
she sings every word to “Fall” — a song 
that sounds utterly boring sandwiched 
between Eilish’s discography. 

It would be easy to call Bieber 

and Eilish opposites. To start, Eilish 
writes her own music at home with 
her brother, Finneas, while one can 
picture the entourage that has likely 
surrounded Bieber in the studio at 
all points in his career. A different 
argument, one that the documentary 
seems to make, is that Billie is her 
generation’s Bieber. Her music is 
“sad,” but as evidenced by the growing 
hordes of adoring fans, people her age 
are looking for someone who sings 
about feeling numb or broken — 
accompanied by the sounds of dental 
drills and crosswalk buzzing, no less. 

This is what makes one of the 

few scenes without Eilish so funny. 
Before the release of her debut album, 
Finneas explains to their parents that 
they need to write a hit song to please 
their record label. Of course, what 
they didn’t know is that they already 
had. “Bad Guy” — a song that Eilish 
represents with eel-like monsters 
in her journal — ousted the record-
smashing “Old Town Road” in the 
summer of 2019. The higher-ups 
wanted something more “accessible” 
but didn’t realize just how “accessible” 

a teenager’s threats to seduce your dad 
can be, at least when Eilish is doing it. 

Despite Eilish’s dark lyrics and 

frank statements on mental health, 
we are welcomed into a loving and 
incredibly supportive family home. 
Eilish is coddled at times and spoiled 
at others, like when she is given her 
dream car on her 16th birthday. All of 
this, footage of a comfortable life in a 
warm home, reminds the viewer that 
mental wellness is often independent 
of one’s family situation; Eilish’s 
mom even says, “It is a horrible time 
to be a teenager.” Citing the 2008 
recession, climate change, racism and 
the opioid epidemic, she says, “Kids 
are depressed, it’s a scary time.” But 
outside factors aren’t solely to blame. 
Adolescence is difficult, no matter 
how loved and supported one might 
be. 

Much of the film is about Eilish’s 

adolescence. Her woes are familiar 
— a boyfriend who has no time for 
her, a sense of self-consciousness 
(exacerbated by her fame) and a 
bad case of imposter syndrome. 
Throughout the film we glimpse her 
feelings of unworthiness; she fears 

letting her supporters down and doubts 
her own abilities. The arrogance of 
adolescence is on display too. Eilish 
seems to be under the impression that 
her own creative vision is unmatched; 
after a bad experience working with 
the director of one of her first music 
videos, she declared she would direct 
them herself in the future (and made 
good on that declaration).

This was another common thread 

throughout the documentary — few 
people seem to grasp where Billie’s 
power comes from. When the 
screen at Coachella isn’t working 
correctly, Eilish is adamant that it 
displays her planned visuals, not 
her. Then in Italy, she runs off stage 
when she tears ligaments in her leg 
because she’s scared she can’t give 
the crowd a good show without 
jumping around. Even though her 
management assures her that the 
audience is there to see her, not the 
spectacle, Billie knows it’s about 
something more. 

Her fans want to see themselves 

in her and her brand — in tarantulas 
and uninhibited dancing. Despite 
claiming to “hate songwriting,” 
Eilish knows that she has tapped 
into a highly accessible weird. It’s 
no wonder then that the handful of 
40-something-year-old, white, male 
executives don’t clap when Billie 
and Finneas finish playing new 
music for them. 

One insufficiently explored aspect 

of the film was the burden of stardom. 
When Eilish is criticized online for 
being rude during a meet-and-greet, 
she laments that she “can’t have a 
bad moment.” It is clear that Eilish 

wasn’t in this for fame, but it can’t be 
said that she doesn’t enjoy it. Fame 
has consequences for young people: 
Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears and, 
yes, Justin Bieber, come to mind. 

When a member of Eilish’s 

public relations team suggests she 
withhold her (negative) opinions on 
drugs and alcohol, lest she grows up 
to change her mind, Eilish’s mother 
has a naïve response. Her mother 
lets the viewer in on her own fears, 
saying, “Why are your parents with 
you all the time … trying to help you 
not to decide to destroy your life 
like people in your shoes have done 
before.” The reality is, no amount 
of parental oversight can save a kid 
from the inferno of fame. And, to be 
clear, no one “decides” to succumb 
to that sort of pressure.

Moments like that one, and when 

Eilish’s mother worries about the 
freshly-licensed pop star driving 
to West Hollywood alone, only 
reinforce the normalcy of Billie’s 
home life. The presence of her 
parents only strengthens the fact 
that Eilish was only 16 years old 
when she toured around the world. 

Billie Eilish is the product of 

unconditional support from her 
family. The love she shares with 
her 
brother 
is 
heartwarming. 

The lesson to be learned is that 
teenage 
superstars 
are 
still 

adolescents 
with 
adolescent 

problems and that acknowledging 
and embracing one’s demons can 
unlock a supportive community 
that celebrates and shares your 
weirdness.

The 
relationship 
between 
a 

mother and daughter is always 
powerful — but have you ever 
wondered what kind of dynamic a 
white mother has with her biracial 
daughter when they are just 15 
years apart in age? It’s a relationship 
worth examining, and “Ginny and 
Georgia” gives you a front-row seat. 

The series is supposed to be a 

modern-day “Gilmore Girls,” but it’s 
far from it. Perhaps it could be better 
described as a mix of “Euphoria” 
and “Black-ish” with a hint of “How 
to Get Away With Murder,” and 
undertones of sex, drugs, money and 
murder. The show, though produced 

by Netflix, has an HBO style to it, 
which makes the plot high-quality 
and entertaining. 

The drama follows a family of 

three in the fictional New England 
town of Wellsbury, Mass., where 
they’ve relocated to start a new life. 
Wellsbury is the kind of town where 
if you’re a minority, you stick out like 
a sore thumb, and if you come from 
wealth, you’ll fit right in. 

Georgia Miller (Brianne Howey, 

“Batwoman”) 
is 
the 
mother 

of 
15-year-old 
daughter 
Ginny 

(Antonia Gentry, “Raising Dion”) 
and son Austin (Diesel La Torraca, 
“Heroes for A Day”) who plays more 
of a best friend role to her children. 
After the shocking death of her 
wealthy ex-husband, Georgia is on 
the prowl in search of the next best 

thing, while Ginny struggles to be 
the new girl for the thousandth 
time as her mom is always running 
from her past. As she adjusts to 
new friends, new boys and new 
experiences, Ginny is faced with the 
cold hard truth of what it means to 
be in strife with her identity.

Faced with microaggressions, 

racial injustice and the dreaded 
questions 
about 
her 
racial 

background, Ginny is constantly 
reminded what it means to be 
biracial and the complexities 
that it brings to her life, no 
matter how hard she tries to 
ignore it. “Ginny and Georgia” 
presents itself merely as an 
emotional tale between a mother 
and daughter, but the show uses 
this trope as a vessel to tell a 

much bigger story about the 
nuances of social identity. 

What’s so great about this 

series is its way of depicting the 
social injustice and discrimination 
Ginny experiences without any 
sugarcoating. It portrays real-life 
situations faced by biracial people, 
like being singled out in AP English 
under the assumption that they’re 
unable to “keep up,” or taking the 
fall for stealing even though their 
white-identifying friends were the 
main culprits. The show allows for 
further discussion on why Black-
white biracial people could never 
be seen as two races, and why they 
are often only associated with their 
minority side and treated as such. 

The objective of the show is 

to feel empathy for Ginny. Who 

can she talk to as the only biracial 
person in her family and the only 
person of color in her friend group? 
In a sense, the show attempts 
to form some relatability for its 
biracial viewers who may be in the 
same boat. 

Sure, shows that include topics 

about race and identity could be 

considered cliché, but it’s up to the 
viewers to dissect the meaning of 
what it means to be biracial in a 
racialized society. The series opens 
up many doors for conversation, and 
if you’re okay with watching Ginny’s 
character constantly go through 
emotional turmoil, prepare to learn 
something new. 

Science fiction has long been an 

effective medium for examining 
deep questions of humanity, morality 
and our relationship with rapidly 
evolving technology as the world 
changes underfoot daily. Some of the 
best works of sci-fi, such as the 1982 
neo-noir thriller “Blade Runner,” or 
2014’s macabre “Ex Machina,” make 
this interrogation look easy. But that 
couldn’t be further from the truth. 
Parables about human identity and 
relationships take time, effort and a 
deep desire to probe into the status 
quo. That might be why I’m surprised 
that the next big property to take a 
shot at this type of groundbreaking 
questioning is “Splatoon 3.”

Announced during the most 

recent Nintendo Direct, “Splatoon 
3” is the third entry in Nintendo’s 
squid-themed third-person shooter 
series. Splatoon’s main appeal has 
always been its surprisingly addictive 
multiplayer option, where modes 
range from the paint-the-map based 
“Turf War” to the cooperative 
horde mode “Salmon Run.” There 
are single-player modes present in 
2015’s “Splatoon” and its 2017 sequel 
“Splatoon 2,” but the campaigns 
generally felt like a loosely connected 
bunch of levels rather than a true 
narrative. If the announcement trailer 
is anything to go by, “Splatoon 3” looks 
to buck that trend by establishing 
a new setting for our squid-kids to 
explore. But this isn’t what caught my 
attention along with many other fans. 

When creating a character in 

the previous two games, players 
were forced to choose between a 
male or female body type. No such 
option exists in what we have seen 
of “Splatoon 3,” merely the choice 

between hair length and whether you 
want to be a squid-based Inkling or 
octopus-based Octoling. There is no 
gender in the world of “Splatoon 3,” 
and I couldn’t be happier about it. 

In a world that is rapidly changing, 

it has become increasingly difficult for 
game developers to ignore accurate 
representation of the LGBTQIA+ 
community. No longer are queer 
voices shoved back into the closet; 
to actively not include any queer 
representation is to exclude a vocal 
minority of gamers and their allies. 
Not only does it make for bad optics, 
but there are growing financial and 
societal repercussions for such a 
negative decision. Even still, not every 
developer chooses to acknowledge 
real-world issues. Nintendo has long 
been the top culprit for refusing 
to place real-world issues in their 
“family-friendly games,” which is 
why the decision to throw out gender 
in “Splatoon 3” is so refreshing.

Being a Japanese studio, Nintendo 

has a heritage of being on the more 
conservative side of the spectrum 
among game developers, which 
makes it all the more fascinating that 
they are doing more impactful work 
than some Western studios. Polish 
developer CD Projekt Red got flak 
for tying voice pitch to gender in their 
hard sci-fi action game “Cyberpunk 
2077” (among many other issues). 

It took over a decade for Ubisoft’s 

blockbuster “Assassin’s Creed” series 
to add a playable female character 
and still struggles with deeper issues 
apart from their generally white 
male protagonists. Even RPG darling 
Bioware has been on record saying 
it’s difficult to include non-binary 
characters since it would be “a lot of 
content.”

Working as a stage manager is intense. 

Like studying for a final or bingeing the 
entirety of Grey’s Anatomy in a week, 
stage management is mentally, physically 
and emotionally draining. But that is what 
students working toward a Bachelor of Fine 
Arts in stage management at the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance sign up for — or is 
it? 

The eternal question lies in whether or 

not the training of the theatre industry’s 
future stage managers should be carried 
out traditionally or if it should constantly 
adapt to the current landscape of theatre. 
And in the middle of a pandemic, one has 
to wonder: Should students be the ones 
monitoring the COVID-19 safety of their 
faculty and peers? After interviewing 
Emily Hanlon and Harrison Hoffert, two 
juniors in the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance who also work with University 
Productions (UPROD), I got to know the 
“WWW” — not the worldwide web, but the 
“who, what and when” of accountability as 
a student stage manager.

Stage managers are traditionally known 

for being all about paperwork. From daily 
calls, cue sheets, production analysis and 
a multitude of other documents needed 
to run a production, stage managers are 
worth their weight in the number of 
trees consumed by printing. However, 
stage management can also be about 
relationship-building and communication, 
according to Hanlon.

“(Stage managing is) being a liaison 

between a multitude of departments. 
It is more about keeping an open line 
of communication between everybody 
involved than it is about the role itself,” 
Hanlon told The Daily in a virtual 
interview. “It is you working to serve all the 
other people in the production rather than 
running a department of your own.” 

Although it involves working closely 

with the directors, designers and actors, 
stage managing is truly about “facilitating 
everyone’s ideas as they come together into 
one unified production,” Hoffert said.

However, COVID-19 has changed the 

nature of stage management drastically. 
Now, things look a little different for 
Hoffert: “Now that we are rehearsing 
over Zoom, communication over email, 
text or Zoom has become so much more 
important.” 

It is also important to recognize that 

traditional stage management does not 
have the same efficiency when UPROD 
guidelines for rehearsal spacing are 

counterintuitive to the way traditional 
theater has been conducted in the past.

As Hanlon expressed, “I know that 

my management style goes beyond a 
stage manager; it is more about being a 
facilitator.” Facilitating with a proactive 
mindset allows stage managers to, as 
Hoffert said, “notice things before other 
people do,” which is useful in adapting to 
the perpetually changing virtual rehearsal 
process. 

Working during the COVID-19 era, 

particularly in-person, has created a whole 
new set of struggles for stage managers to 
adapt to. In addition to their normal set of 
responsibilities, student stage managers 
now have to deal with maintaining safety 
in accordance with UPROD COVID-19 
guidelines. Walking the line between these 

two distinct kinds of accountability is no 
easy task. “There is a high level of human 
error to COVID protocol,” Hanlon said. “If 
a director approaches an actor to give a note 
and isn’t mindful of the six-foot distance 
… it puts a stage manager, specifically 
a student stage manager, in a difficult 
position of (determining) what is COVID 
policing and what is stage managing.”

Added Hoffert: “It is very easy to step 

six feet near someone; it is very easy to 

take your mask off to take a sip of water, 
and stage managers are already in a unique 
role where they are already watching and 
staying one step ahead (of everyone else in 
the production).” 

Both students agree that student stage 

managers should not be the ones to carry 
the entire weight of a production’s health 
and safety on their shoulders. 

“I think there are improvements that 

can be made,” Hanlon said. “Always 
finding ways of taking the (COVID-19) 
responsibility off students is important.” 

Steps have been taken to address this 

concern. “In the fall, it was shop heads 
(maintaining COVID-19 policies), and 
now there are house technicians who are 
responsible,” Hoffert assured. “The Health 
and Safety Coordinators are responsible 

for walking around and making sure we 
are following protocols.”

Added Hanlon: “The days I felt the 

safest and the COVID policies were most 
enforced were days when someone who 
was not involved in the project, who didn’t 
even know what we needed to accomplish 
for the day was there, because their only 
interest was maintaining COVID protocol. 
I think one of the difficulties of a student 
stage manager is setting boundaries.”

Conversations 
about 
theater 

accountability need to account for the fact 
that stage managers are already asked 
to invest 110% of their effort in order to 
“succeed” in normal circumstances. In the 
current theatrical climate, when theaters 
are reopening under the constraints 
of rigid COVID-19 regulations, stage 
managers have to find ways to make time 
for safety while already trying to juggle 
the rest of their responsibilities. Is asking 
this much of stage managers simply part 
of the job, or is it something that needs to 
change?

“I personally think UPROD asks … me 

to do the job of a professional filling the 
role, which is demanding, but that’s what 
I signed up for,” Hoffert said. “We came 
here to do the role, we came here to do 
the entire job and it is hard as a student 
and is a lot to do, but it gives us a great life 
experience we can take with us later.”

Added Hanlon: “I would say all stage 

managers are overworked, period. I hope 
to see the death of this ‘perfect stage 
manager’ ideology.” 

To put it simply, I agree with Hanlon. 

As a costume designer, I have often seen 
stage managers be pushed to the side for 
the sake of getting the scene just right. It is 
not okay for stage managers to be the last 
defense for accountability in the theatre 
world. To ask stage managers — unpaid 
student stage managers at that — to be 
overworked for the sake of meeting the 
“industry standard” is a futile waste of the 
University’s vast resources and influence. 

The path to allow stage managers 

to voice their concerns about COVID-
19 safety is a difficult one, but it is one 
that the Department of Theatre & 
Drama signed up for when agreeing 

to the terms of the Department of 
Theatre & Drama strike this past fall. 
According to the demands of Theatre 
& Drama students for stage managers, 
and by agreeing to “prioritize wellness,” 
one might cynically suspect that the 
department would take the easy way 
out. (I’m looking at you and your two 
“wellness days,” University President 
Mark Schlissel). 

On the contrary, the Department of 

Theatre & Drama, specifically the design 
and production faculty, have done a 
great job of hearing the concerns of their 
student stage managers. “I appreciate 
production manager Paul Hunter (and 
stage management faculty Nancy Uffner) 
because they hold those student demands 
very highly in the work they do,” Hanlon 
said.

Hoffert agreed. He added that it is 

important to have “grace for people and 
understanding 
that 
everyone’s 
going 

through different situations daily, and 
then having the grace to deal with those 
situations.”

With regard to the effect that COVID-19 

will continue to have on theatre, Hanlon 
said, “Things are going to change, and as 
much as everybody wants things to go back 
to the way they were, I don’t think they ever 
will, so why cling to them when we can try 
new things, important things.”

There is still work to be done. Although 

both Hanlon and Hoffert believe that 
positive change has occurred, Hanlon 
remarked that “the seriousness that 
(Theatre & Drama strike) demands are 
taken is more from professor to professor, 
rather than the unity of a department.” 

The question posed in the title is 

rhetorical, but it is one of the fundamental 
questions in stage management. Whose job 
is it? 

Without defining the role of a stage 

manager, you are creating an unjust 
workplace. 
Without 
explicitly 
asking 

for feedback from a stage manager, you 
are creating inequity. Theater needs to 
start asking more questions, and not the 
softball kind, but the kind that will end 
this unattainable perfection that is asked of 
stage managers.

Few artists can take control of their 

listeners’ emotions the way slowthai can. On 
his debut Nothing Great About Britain, he 
could make you want to start a revolution one 
minute, then compel you to call your friends to 
tell them you love them by the end of the next 
song.

Slowthai still has his hand on the joystick, 

playing with his listeners’ hearts on his latest 
album, TYRON. But this time around, he’s 
toned down the social commentary and 
looks inward more than ever before. It’s not 
unexpected — after all, what’s a self-titled 
album without introspection? (Slowthai’s 
name is Tyron Frampton.)

TYRON is a two-disc album, but not 

because of its length — it’s only a 35-minute 
record. The two-disc format is a stylistic divide. 
Disc one is for the slappers — more music to 
fuel the insane moshpits that are central to 
the slowthai concert experience. Disc two, on 
the other hand, is raw and unfiltered emotion, 
a musical heart-to-heart that sees slowthai at 
his most vulnerable on the mic.

Slowthai doesn’t wait until disc two to get 

introspective. The front half of the album sees 
the artist rapping about drug use, depression 
and suicidal thoughts, often sandwiched 
between less conspicuous lyrics about 
making money and slinging drugs. “Mazza,” 

featuring A$AP Rocky, is emblematic of this. 
It’s a hazy, dream-like track in the style of 
popular Soundcloud and emo rap. From the 
get-go, slowthai lays his heart out in his verse: 
“Feeling like these drugs made me better than 
I was / But I never felt love before the drugs,” 
he raps. Slowthai is so raw on the track that it’s 
almost jarring to hear A$AP Rocky’s generic 
guest verse afterward.

Admittedly, I was nervous when I first saw 

the title of the track “CANCELLED.” When 
the single came out, I learned that slowthai 
had been “canceled” by Twitter before after 
an incident at an award ceremony. When 
someone talks about their experience being 
canceled in their music, it can often drag out 
the drama and make it harder for everyone 
to move past it. Thankfully, slowthai’s 
tried-and-true 
partnership 
with 
Skepta 

makes “CANCELLED” the hype highlight 
of disc one. The beat is driven by a zen-like 
flute melody that nosedives into an eerie 
horror-movie-esque synth halfway into the 
track. Skepta’s hook is the catchiest on the 
album, and fortunately, slowthai is beyond 
acknowledging his cancellation at this point — 
he aims well-deserved jabs at the Oscars and 
the Grammys.

The front half goes hard, but the back half 

of the album is where TYRON truly shines. 
It’s the same heartfelt introspection that’s 
spread throughout the whole album but 
often delivered more gently, reflecting the 
vulnerability of the lyricism.

The beats are a refreshing switch-up 

from the first half’s sinister aesthetic. The 
acoustic guitar on “push” or the piano melody 
on “nhs” are at odds with the synthetic 
instrumentation of the first half, bringing a 
touch of rawness and authenticity. Featured 
guest singers like James Blake and Deb Never 
reinforce this somber style with beautiful 
echoey choruses. Most tracks have moments 
where the instruments mellow out for a 
moment, or the drums take a pause, giving 
breathing room for the verse to take the 
forefront.

Many of slowthai’s verses are dripping 

with existential dread. When he uses his 
talent for clever songwriting to depict his 
own pain, slowthai’s lyrics become bullets 
to the heart. “We filled cracks of broken 
homes with broken dreams and broken 
bones / If walls could scream, ears would 
bleed,” he sings on “i tried.” Heart-wrenching 
songwriting like this is all over the album’s 
back half, and it’s impossible to fully digest it 
even on the fourth, fifth and sixth listen.

Slowthai captures every facet of mental 

illness in each track: The sinking depression 
of “i tried,” fighting an uphill battle on 
“focus,” the persistence to move forward on 
“push.” All these feelings are resolved on 
“nhs,” the highpoint of slowthai’s emotional 
rollercoaster. In it, he wholeheartedly 
embraces life’s hardships, showing gratitude 
to the lows for giving meaning to all of life’s 
joys.

Despite this, the album ends on its 

darkest note in “adhd,” a tracklisting choice 
that colors the whole tone of the album 
Here, slowthai dives deepest into the mental 
trappings of depression and loneliness, 
singing each line with such defeat that it 
feels as though he’s given up. 

I keep asking myself, what does it mean 

that slowthai chose to end the album on 
the loneliest track rather than the happy 
resolution of “nhs”? When I reflect on my 
own struggles with mental health, I think 

slowthai is suggesting a cycle — the sense 
that once you’ve felt that depth of loneliness, 
it lives with you forever, always under the 
threat of resurfacing.

TYRON is a gut punch. It feels less like 

a page from slowthai’s journal and more 
like a slice of his brain, taken from the part 
that holds his stream of consciousness. Few 
artists can so eloquently and passionately lay 
their darkest thoughts out, and few albums 
so uniquely encapsulate the magnitudes of 
mental illness.

“Pelé,” Netflix’s latest foray into “30 for 

30”-esque sports documentaries, chronicles 
the former Brazilian soccer player’s career 
from his first World Cup in 1958 to his 
last in 1970. With a mixture of strange, 
half-dubbed/half-subtitled 
talking-head 

interviews and old television footage, 
directors Ben Nicholas and David Tryhorn 
(“Crossing the Line”) try to unpack the 
legacy of one of the most iconic figures 
in sports history. Unfortunately, the film 
never gets deep enough into the material 
to give the audience a more thorough 
understanding of Pelé’s story.

There are plenty of surface-level sports 

documentaries that are perfectly enjoyable 
to watch — like this past year’s “The 
Last Dance” — but the biggest problem 
with “Pelé” is that it could have a much 
bigger impact. While something like “The 
Last Dance” can just have fun with the 
personalities and dynamics of the players, 
“Pelé” feels like it is attempting to make 
a greater statement about something but 
never quite takes the risks necessary to get 
there.

For example, a large portion of the 

documentary is focused on the rise of the 
military dictatorship that ruled over Brazil 
from 1964 to 1985. However, because the 
dictatorship and Pelé never quite intersect, 
the film never gives the audience great 
insight into either. The documentary has a 
moment when it looks like it might criticize 
Pelé for not using his status and influence 
to speak out against the new oppressive 
regime — à la Muhammad Ali speaking 
out against the Vietnam War — but the 
film quickly brushes this aside in favor of 
continuing to paint him as a hero. It would 
be one thing if the film was always trying 
to keep Pelé’s mythic image intact — plenty 
of good sports documentaries do that — but 
the fact that the documentary brings up 
the criticism of Pelé means that it creates 
an opportunity for depth that it completely 
fails to capitalize on. It’s a disappointing 
choice by the filmmakers, especially when 
doing the opposite could have turned the 
film into something special.

Another example of the documentary’s 

failure is that it decides not to focus on 
the potential psychological effects of 
Pelé’s celebrity status. The film spends 
a few minutes talking about how Pelé’s 
worldwide fame forced him to travel a lot 

which put a strain on his family life, but 
these issues are never brought up again 
once the segment ends. From both old 
and new interviews, we can see in Pelé’s 
face the mental toll his life must be taking 
on him. But by spending so little time 
on it, the film passes up the opportunity 
to deconstruct the toxic nature of the 
celebrity lifestyle.

“Pelé” feels like it’s trying to cram too 

much into one film. It tries to be a film about 
athletic greatness, celebrity and political 
unrest all in under two hours. As a result, 
parts of the film feel rushed, which is no 
doubt the reason it fails to explore any of its 
themes in greater depth. The part that gets 
the most attention is, unfortunately, the 
least interesting aspect of the film: Pelé’s 
athletic ability.

Focusing most of its attention on Pelé’s 

incredible talent satisfies no one. Soccer 
fans already know how great he is and 
do not need over an hour’s worth of 
reminders. Non-fans of soccer can get the 
gist of his greatness pretty quickly from a 
few of his highlights. By spending so much 
time on Pelé’s soccer skills, the film keeps 
hammering home a point that ultimately 
doesn’t tell the audience much about 
anything.

The best sports documentaries always 

use sports as a backdrop to explore bigger 
themes: “Hoop Dreams” uses high school 
basketball to explore race, class and 
education in the United States; “Diego 
Maradona” uses soccer to explore addiction, 
fame and identity. 

“Pelé” uses soccer to explore … soccer. It 

mentions bigger issues outside of the sport, 
but it never focuses on them long enough 
to make an impact. Considering how iconic 
of a figure Pelé is, and how interesting so 
much of his story is, “Pelé” is ultimately a 
forgettable disappointment.

S

ept. 25, 2015. One day after 

achieving his dream of listening 

to Pope Francis’s address to a 

joint session of Congress, the embattled 

Speaker of the House, former U.S. 

Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, gathered 

reporters for a surprise press conference. 

While he initially performed as a strident 

reformer for government accountability 

when he first was elected in the 1990s, 

Boehner grew into an establishment 

Republican. During his run, he became 

increasingly focused on making the 

government function despite being met 

with growing far-right obstructionists: 

the Tea Party. 

The far-right had vilified Boehner 

at every turn for the past five years, but 

their recent outgrowth, the Freedom 

Caucus, pushed his final nerve and forced 

Boehner to retire. Upon leaving, however, 

he did not fail to take some parting shots 

at those he referred to as “legislative 

terrorists” who are tearing apart the 

Republican Party. And, almost as a final 

show of independence, Boehner’s final 

piece of legislation, the Bipartisan Budget 

Act of 2015, passed the House with no 

Freedom Caucus votes, instead co-opting 

a coalition of moderate Republicans and 

Democrats in Congress who neglected 

the far-reaches of their respective parties. 

This act, however, was a brief veer from a 

larger overarching narrative of legislative 

radicalization by ideologues willing to 

hijack the legislative process. 

The Freedom Caucus began as 

nine Tea Party members who were 

emboldened by the 2014 midterm 

elections to form a group of “bright junior 

legislators who do not look kindly on an 

established leadership that has largely 

failed to achieve conservative goals it has 

promised the voters.” While they view 

themselves glowingly, the establishment 

of the Republican Party, specifically 

Boehner, viewed their cohesiveness 

and activism as intransigence and false 

prophecy. Despite this, their membership 

has grown to as high as 40 members and 

currently sits at around 36 (an estimation 

because the Freedom Caucus does not 

release its membership).

This original group of nine were even 

further to the right than many of their 

Tea Party contemporaries. They were 

willing to exercise their influence to make 

legislation more conservative at all costs, 

including killing bills that they disagreed 

with despite these bills having the support 

of the majority of Republicans. While 

their principles are up for debate among 

both caucus members and Republicans at 

large, the former largely functions as one 

voting bloc and has undoubtedly caused 

widespread frustration and dysfunction 

in Washington D.C.

While Freedom Caucus members 

cause major disruption in Washington, 

their home districts’ Republicans do 

not look very ideologically different 

than those of the average Republican-

controlled district. Common thought 

suggests that constituents’ ideology 

should be embodied by their member 

of Congress. However, given that 

Freedom Caucus members’ policies are 

significantly more conservative than 

the average Republican, the ideological 

similarities of Republican constituents is 

baffling. 

The House Freedom Caucus refuses 

to take responsibility for the division that 

they cause throughout the Republican 

Party. They instead find enemies in 

congressional leadership to blame, and 

they exert this blame through not only 

rhetoric but also their political action 

committee: the House Freedom Fund. 

This PAC, according to former U.S. 

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., is devoted 

to “sending principled conservative 

outsiders to D.C.” Functionally, they 

support 
mostly 
far-right 
primary 

challengers to establishment candidates 

in House elections.

In the 2018 midterms, the HFF was 

affiliated with 18 primary challengers, 

eight of whom won. This success rate 

for both the HFF and other far-right 

conservatives in Republican districts 

contributes to the overall polarization 

of 
Congress 
— 
it 
either 
forces 

establishment Republicans to move right 

to avoid a primary challenger or replaces 

incumbents with far-right newcomers. 

This ideological purity enforcement 

that the Freedom Caucus supports is 

systematically taking over the Republican 

Party and ultimately polarizes Congress 

because of progressive liberals’ scaled-

back yet significant movement to the left. 

This limits the choices of the 

American people and ultimately leads 

to increasing inefficiency in Congress 

until the entire institution grinds to 

a halt. In other words, the Freedom 

Caucus and some progressive groups are 

willing to sacrifice incremental action for 

ideological purity, and that harms all of 

us. It ruins everyday American’s faith in 

government and slowly pushes us to want 

to burn the place down. This mentality 

led to the election of former President 

Donald Trump, the birth of QAnon and 

the failed Jan. 6 insurrection, which is not 

going to stop unless we make it. 

In F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great 

Gatsby,” my favorite scene is when a 

strange car pulls into Gatsby’s driveway 

after he has died, flashes its lights and 

leaves. The narrator says, “I didn’t 

investigate. Probably it was some final 

guest who had been away at the ends of 

the earth and didn’t know that the party 

was over.” 

While it is such a simple statement, 

it makes a profound point about this 

country and our core values. Our 

greatest quality as Americans is 

innovation, which is sourced from a 

fundamental curiosity and a desire to 

improve our world. However, when 

hope is taken away from us, we cease 

exploring because we are no longer 

curious, which is when the party is truly 

over. 

I’ll be honest; I believe that the 

Republican party faces an existential 

threat. It’s neither Trump nor the 

Freedom Caucus members themselves. 

Republicans are threatened by so many 

people turning off their televisions and 

tuning out political processes because 

they have lost hope, contributing to our 

dangerous culture of polarization and 

diminished communication.

Polarization 
has 
spread 
into 

everything from watching the news 

— when we choose to consume it — to 

who we choose as friends. At the center 

of it all is a growing mentality that says 

we cannot get along if we do not agree. 

Slowly, this polarization has turned many 

of us — on some issue or another — into 

miniature voting terrorists who are more 

willing to watch the world burn than get 

along.

S

ince President Joe Biden took 

office and the United States 

Senate flipped blue, a lot of 

Democrats have thought about removing 

the filibuster, a procedure used in the 

senate to delay or block the vote on a 

bill, to ensure policymaking can actually 

happen. The way the filibuster currently 

works in the U.S. Senate is that without 

reaching a 60 vote cloture threshold, 41 

or more senators can hold up legislation 

by filibustering. This applies to almost 

all bills in the Senate and prevents 

legislation from reaching the president’s 

desk. If, as Americans, we are to remove 

the filibuster, it must be coupled with 

immense safeguards to ensure the 

continuation of democracy and rule of 

law. 

It is no secret that the Republican 

Party of today stands in stark contrast 

to Paul Ryan’s GOP or the party of 10 

or 20 years ago. Today’s GOP is heavily 

focused on protecting Trumpism and 

denying all the criticism surrounding 

that crowd. We have seen that they will 

go to great lengths to protect former 

President Donald Trump and his views 

at any and all costs insofar as they tried, 

unsuccessfully, to overturn what experts 

have dubbed the most secure election 

in our nation’s history. If Democrats 

remove 
the filibuster and the current 

version of the GOP ever returns to power, 

there could be dire and irreversible 

consequences for this country.

The first thing Democrats would need 

to do to prevent this is to ensure statehood 

for both the District of Columbia and 

Puerto Rico. This is for two reasons: It 

would tilt the Senate more to the left 

and it would act in the core interest of 

democracy. 

D.C. and Puerto Rico both have 

progressive possibilities that Democrats 

can utilize, the former especially so. It 

would be crucial for Democrats to gain 

the extra three or four Senate seats from 

these two new states to shore up their 

growing majority. With these states 

added, the flimsy one or two-seat majority 

that has become more common in recent 

years would turn more solidly blue, and, 

without a filibuster, the Democrats could 

ensure that policymaking is actually 

accomplished. 

However, 
without 
these 
two 

prospective states and their senators, 

we could be looking at a Senate run by 

Republicans committed to blocking 

any legislation Democrats try to 

promote, especially when coupled 

with the filibuster. Thus, it is incredibly 

important that if the filibuster is 

removed, it is coupled with D.C. and 

Puerto Rico’s statehood and subsequent 

congressional representation.

Their statehood will also ensure that 

democracy is perpetuated throughout 

the country. D.C. has about 700,000 

residents and Puerto Rico has another 

3 million. These are individuals who 

pay taxes to the U.S. government, yet 

do not have voting representation in 

Congress, which goes against one of the 

core values of this country: no taxation 

without representation. It is morally 

wrong to continuously take from these 

people without giving them what is 

rightfully theirs. This is an argument 

that Democrats can lean on if they 

need to find the right framing for this 

proposal.

The second biggest safeguard which 

should follow filibuster removal would 

be to reform voting rights and pass a 

new Voting Rights Act. Democrats in 

the House have taken great steps to 

make this a reality by proposing the For 

the People Act, which will be voted on 

soon. This proposal would create more 

transparency in donations, attempt to 

minimize big money interests’ impact 

on politics, require same-day voter 

registration in many places, allow 

congressional districts to be drawn by 

non-partisan committees and many 

other provisions to increase access to 

voting for all eligible individuals. 

Not only is this bill good in 

theory, but when polled, a majority 

of Americans had a favorable opinion 

on the proposal, with 68% of those 

surveyed across party lines saying 

they would be in favor and only 16% 

in opposition. It is clear that there is 

already public support for this change 

— the Democrats should capitalize on it. 

All of these measures have come 

in response to an unprecedented 

level of voter suppression attempts by 

Republicans across the country. As of 

Feb. 19, the Brennan Center for Justice 

found that there have been 253 bills — 

majorly spearheaded by Republican 

representatives — introduced to limit 

voting rights in 43 states in 2021, with 

some seeking to disenfranchise millions 

of eligible voters. This shows the levels 

to which some members of the GOP 

may go in order to retain power, namely 

stifling the voice of the people. 

The two aforementioned measures 

that Democrats in Congress could work 

toward without the filibuster would 

greatly change the party’s dynamics 

in the coming years. The Senate would 

be more firmly in the Democratic 

column for the foreseeable future as 

more people casting legal ballots leads 

to more liberal candidates winning, 

and they would have an advantage 

in the two new states. Republicans 

would be forced to move away from 

divisive Trump-fueled hate and back 

towards 
their 
laissez-faire 
policy 

platform, in hopes of recapturing their 

previously moderate voter base or risk 

losing power until a new generation of 

Republicanism is born. 

While there are potential risks 

of opening the door for Sen. Mitch 

McConnell, R-Ky., to regain control of a 

post-filibuster Senate, passing these two 

measures can ensure that actual policy 

making becomes the primary goal of 

politics in this country once again. 

I

magine turning your passion 
into your career. Maybe it’s art, 
music or sports; you might con-

sider academia in areas such as sci-
ence, history or math. Whatever it is, 
take a second and envision yourself at 
the highest professional level of that 
interest. Relish this thought.

Now imagine it’s been stripped 

away from you completely and sud-
denly. No warning — it’s gone. You’d 
be upset, right? For Eldrick “Tiger” 
Woods and those of whose Sunday 
afternoons he occupied, this is a new 
reality. In a car accident in which he 
plowed through a massive sign and 
wrestled with 50 feet of forest off a 
boulevard in Southern California, the 
likelihood that we see him back on a 
golf course hangs in the balance. 

In emailing with my high school 

teacher, he wrote about how 
Woods may finally achieve peace 
in giving up competitive golf. 
“Tiger,” as we know him, has been 
the pinnacle of the sport for the 
past twenty-five years and defined 
by the game since he was three 
years old. With that, my former 
instructor believes, comes a lack of 
freedom to enjoy life’s other expe-
riences and an absence of personal 

sanity that cannot be replicated by 
anything else.

While he may be right about the 

consuming nature of professional 
sports and the toll they take on their 
athletes, I reject the notion that a 
competitor is better off without 
competition. Within all of us, not 
just athletes, inherent qualities exist 
that predispose us to our preferred 
environments. To depart these com-
munities is to lose a piece of our indi-
viduality — an irreplaceable strain of 
our DNA.

Thus, we search for proper closure. 

Often, we fantasize about saving the 
day and riding off into the sunset with 
many stories to tell future generations. 
While this conclusion may seem ide-
alistic for many, it is this “Hollywood 
ending” that gives us something to 
aspire to, a pleasant thought to occupy 
the vacancy of the daily grind. I doubt 
totaling a Genesis GV80 in a 45 mph 
speed zone is the lasting thought 
Woods wants of himself.

If someone told me today that this 

was the last column I’d ever write 
for The Daily, I’d be utterly disheart-
ened. I love expressing my opinions 
through written words and have 
done it for the past five years of my 

life. It’s become ingrained in my life, 
though not at the same level of inten-
sity as how golf and Woods co-exist. 
Hence, I’d search for another cred-
ible, successful platform to voice my 
“hot takes.” 

However, for the class of 2024, we 

do know what this feels like. All of 
our quintessential senior high school 
moments went from postponed 
to canceled in a whirlwind and all 
we could do is watch them vanish 
before our eyes. Does it bring me 
peace knowing there is more ahead 
in life? Possibly, but I will always feel 
as though there are loose ends that 
are unlikely to ever be tied up in my 
hometown. Granted, starting college 
in a virtual setting hasn’t helped. 

Conversely, think about this year’s 

graduating class and the intern-
ships they had lined up this time last 
year. These pivotal opportunities are 
instrumental for after college, yet they 
were nearly impossible to coordinate 
during the height of the pandemic. 

I 

want to learn, but they aren’t 
teaching me. This thought 
echoed in my mind as I found 

myself drowning in yet another 
meaningless formula.

I am an economics major, and 

I’ve known that I wanted to be one 
since my junior year of high school. 
At the University of Michigan, 
many students think of economics 
as business-adjacent — we’re the 
“Rossholes” who couldn’t get into 
the Ross School of Business. To me, 
though, it is so much more. I fell 
in love with economics because I 
wanted to understand people and 
their decisions. I believe in economics 
as a tool for social growth, and that 
understanding how people behave 
and act is key to creating a high-
functioning 
society. 
Economics 

provides a way for people to learn 
how we interact with the world and 
with each other, which gives us the 
tools to fundamentally change the 
workings of society.

That said, the department of 

economics at the University has 

been beating this society-focused 
ideology out of its underclassmen 
students. Simply, the curriculum 
lacks accessibility, social thinking 
and a global outlook. Economics 101, 
a class taken by many students at the 
University of Michigan, provides an 
introduction to economic theories 
for students from every college, 
including the Business School and 
College of Engineering, as well as 
students from a myriad of majors in 
LSA.

The quintessential class for 

freshmen, Economics 101 has the 
unique opportunity to provide 
students with a new outlook on 
the society they are poised to 
enter. However, the applications 
of economics are not discussed in 
introductory 
economics 
classes 

and only rarely are discussed in 
the upper-level classes. They ruin 
this unique opportunity by using 
cut-and-paste formulas to explain 
economic theory instead of using the 
most basic logical theories to ground 
the class in reality. We should be 

learning about the applications of 
and reasoning behind economic 
theory to ground students in the 
practice of thinking using economic 
analysis. Instead, these classes 
dive headfirst into problems that 
often make it difficult for students 
with no economic background to 
understand why the answers are 
correct.

Is it really a wonder, then, why 

so many students complain about 
having to take economics classes 
when it is never shown to apply to 
their own majors and future careers. 
Engineers will understandably roll 
their eyes at supply and demand 
even though the analytic thinking 
required for economics could give 
them a different way of problem-
solving that can be applicable to their 
own lives. 

A

h, the suburbs. Strip malls 
abound. 
Neighborhoods-

upon-neighborhoods 
of 

cookie-cutter McMansions lining 
endless 
perpendicular 
streets, 

full of minivans driven by parents 
shepherding their children around. 
What’s not to love? A lot.

Okay, fine. The suburbs certainly 

have plenty of benefits. The main 
advantage that comes to mind is the 
sheer amount of space: huge houses, 
large parks, wide roads, etc. 

When people are (hopefully) 

confined to their homes during a 
pandemic, feelings of claustrophobia 
often arise — especially in cities 
where people have smaller living 
quarters. Recently, spacious suburbs 
have become more enticing to city-
dwellers. During this quarantine 
period, people have been moving in 
huge exoduses into the suburbs. 

As the populations of already-

shrinking cities continue to diminish 
faster than ever, it’s essential to 
address the question: Should we 
rethink negative opinions of the 
suburbs? Are suburbs the answer to 
our global problem of overcrowded 
cities? 

My answer? No. Suburbia isn’t 

a productive solution: not to the 
overcrowding and under-planning of 
cities, nor to public-health crises we 
are currently facing. 

When mentioning suburbs, it’s 

important 
to 
acknowledge 
the 

premise on which they were founded: 
racism and capitalism. Often, suburbs 
were built for white Americans in the 
1940s and 1950s. Many developers 
sought to capitalize on racial fears 
and the white flight by portraying 
living in the suburbs as more 
attractive to white buyers. White 
Americans with money –– especially 

veterans assisted by GI Bills — were 
eager to leave cities that struggled 
through the Great Depression and 
World War II. Cars were, and still are, 
an expensive necessity to navigate 
through neighborhoods and were 
only accessible to the middle and 
upper classes.

Suburbs 
are 
often 
built 

around 
exclusion, 
self-isolating 

into 
“acceptable” 
communities. 

Founded on exclusionary ideals, 
removing suburbia’s past from its 
present is tricky — racism is alive 
and dominant in our communities. 
De facto segregation, extremely 
rampant in the 1940s and 1950s, 
is still common today, even in the 
suburbs where we live. Metro Detroit 
and its surrounding suburbs are still 
one of the most segregated areas in 
America. Not even three years ago 
in Rochester Hills, a school disctrict 
that sends hundreds of students to 
the University of Michigan, a Black 
teen was shot at just for knocking 
on a door to ask for directions. This 
pattern of overt and fatal racism 
makes people of color feel extremely 
unwelcome in the suburbs.

It’s worth noting that the people 

currently 
fleeing 
major 
cities, 

such as New York City, come from 
incredibly wealthy neighborhoods, 
as this study shows. The suburbs 
frequently 
create 
barriers 
for 

entry and in communities where 
conformity is expected and cars 
are expensive but necessary for 
transportation, it can feel impossible 
to be accepted unless one is rich 
and white. Thus, the suburbs 
feel like a terrible solution to the 
overcrowding of cities as they 
exacerbate inequality. Currently, 
suburbia is not a productive goal for 
urban development.

But are suburbs safer during 

pandemics? It seems intuitive that 
since there’s more distance between 
people, transmission should be lower. 
However, that may not be the case — 
actually, quite the opposite. 

According to studies recently done 

by Johns Hopkins University and a 
slew of other publications, suburbs 
are actually more unsafe than cities 
since people in the suburbs have to 
travel further distances, have a lack 
of access to health care and take 
fewer risk. Additionally, countries 
reported to have the most controlled 
COVID-19 
outbreaks, 
including 

Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam, 
are incredibly densely populated. 
The density of their population 
didn’t seem to matter in relation 
to the outbreak — what did matter 
was the response from public health 
officials and the efficiency of their 
contract tracing. All of the countries 
mentioned above had efficient and 
effective public health committees, 
travel restrictions and smart, data-
tracking 
cities, 
which 
enabled 

efficient contact tracing. Lowering 
the human density of a city isn’t a 
solution to public health crises, but 
increasing public health and urban 
planning infrastructure is. Suburbs 
currently don’t have the public health 
resources nor the urban tracking 
systems in place to effectively combat 
COVID-19. So, what advantages can 
they actually provide?

Personally, despite all of these 

facts, a small part of me still longs for 
the open spaces of the suburbs.

The LSA Economics department is failing us all

How Democrats can safely end the filibuster


2-News

Editor’s Note: This statement was previously 

provided by Phoenix to the News section last 

week and was partially quoted in this news story. 

The Michigan Daily is now reprinting Phoenix’s 

statement regarding the discontinuation of their 

organization in full so that it is on the public record.
I

n 1979, Adara, later renamed Phoenix, 

was founded as a senior-only female secret 

honor society at the University of Michigan. 

According to the organization’s documents, Adara 

was founded after a Title IX complaint was filed 

against the University’s male-only secret society, 

Michigamua, who later changed its name to Order 

of Angell. Founded on principles of “character, 

achievement, leadership, loyalty and service,” 

and to give women leaders across campus space 

for support and empowerment, Adara occupied 

the upper floors of the Michigan Union’s tower 

alongside Michigamua in what was later known as 

the Tower Society. 

This past year, the history and practices of secret 

societies have been top of mind for many students 

on campus. They have been top of mind for us, 

too, the Phoenix class of 2021. We were “tapped” 

for this organization the week that the University 

switched to virtual classes. We were initiated over 

the spring and summer through numerous Zoom 

meetings. Though our class never met in person, 

Phoenix’s traditions dictate that we “tap” around 

25 juniors in “leadership” positions around campus 

this month to become our organization’s class of 

2022.

However, for the first time in our organization’s 

history, we will not be tapping another Phoenix 

class. Instead, we are discontinuing our 

organization’s presence on campus.

When we were first tapped for Phoenix almost 

a year ago, we were told that “P” was what we 

made of it. The only purpose of our organization 

was to anonymously improve campus through our 

roles as campus leaders. We could launch our own 

projects and initiatives for the improvement of the 

University as a whole. We would build friendships 

throughout the process, taking advantage of 

relationships that would otherwise not have been 

formed.

We’ve spent recent months studying our history 

and debating our future. On Feb. 21, our class voted 

by an overwhelming majority not to tap another 

class. We view our vote not as a judgment of the 

past but as a declaration about the future: Phoenix 

and other secret honor societies do not belong on 

our present campus.

This decision was not taken lightly by our class, 

nor was it made out of convenience. It was not 

made in connection with — nor was it influenced 

by — Order’s recently publicized outreach to its 

alumni regarding its future. 

There are many reasons why we have made 

this decision. We believe that our organization’s 

mandate of “campus leaders” as a prerequisite for 

membership is inherently elitist. Leadership roles 

within this organization are obtained through 

and sustained by privilege. The meaning of this 

phrase has never been defined. In reality, each 

class of Phoenix is tapped mostly by friends in 

previous classes, compounding issues of elitism 

and homogeneity that have long plagued our 

organization.

Twenty-five seniors could never be truly 

representative of the wealth of cultures, beliefs 

and experiences that make up a senior class of 

the University. We also recognized the cognitive 

dissonance Black members, Indigenous members 

and members of color face in secret societies. Our 

members should never have had to contemplate 

their relationship to secret societies’ racist history 

and elitist nature. 

Over this past year, we’ve watched members 

face backlash for their role in these organizations. 

A number of student groups for students of racial, 

religious and ethnic minorities have specifically 

denounced secret societies and forbade their 

members from participating in these organizations. 

We believe this is a cycle that will continue if left 

unchecked. Recruiting a diverse class does nothing 

to alleviate this structural flaw.

“It is weird and discouraging to have to 

think, ‘Am I joining a racist club?’ It is even more 

unnerving to be actively told while being recruited 

that Phoenix is not racist,” one BIPOC member of 

our class said. (This member has asked to remain 

anonymous for fear of professional retribution.) “I 

did and still do believe that Phoenix is not a racist 

society. However, it is modeled after one and I 

think that it is time to realize that distinction.”

This member recalled speaking to another 

prospective BIPOC member about this dissonance. 

Ultimately, this member decided not to join after 

citing similar concerns.

Given these facts, we cannot in good conscience 

move forward with Phoenix knowing the harm that 

secret societies have caused and will continue to 

inflict if still in existence. No amount of rebranding 

can plaster over the inherently problematic nature 

of these organizations.

If there was one redeeming quality we found 

in Phoenix, it was the random friendships that it 

fostered between our members. Despite our class 

meeting mostly over Zoom, we recognize and 

appreciate the value in bringing together people 

who would likely never otherwise cross paths. 

We hope that interest in forming new senior-year 

cross-campus friendships rises from the ashes 

of our decision, though we believe it needs to be 

completely separate from the existing constructs of 

senior secret societies on campus.

Rather than contemplating a year-long 

“pause,” we urge the current members of Order, 

and all other secret societies, to discontinue their 

organizations indefinitely. Beyond discontinuing 

our own organization, we believe the dissolution 

of all secret societies to be in the best interest of the 

U-M community.

A

s thousands of new pet-owners have 

discovered during the pandemic, 

dogs are simply the best. I have 

two myself and being without them has 

made returning to Ann Arbor each semester 

incredibly difficult. During a pandemic that 

has burdened millions with increased anxiety 

and stress, it should be no surprise that a 

significant number of people have recently 

chosen to add some furry members to their 

families. After all, dogs are proven to provide 

legitimate health benefits, both physically 

and mentally. The University of Michigan 

realized this fact long ago, offering times for 

students to hang out with dogs at least a few 

times a year. 

Nearly 40% of all American households own 

dogs, including (except for former President 

Donald Trump) every U.S. president since 

William McKinley, which is over 100 years 

of presidential dogs. President Joe Biden 

revived that presidential trend, welcoming his 

two beautiful German shepherds, Champ and 

Major, into the White House.

This past week, Greg Kelly — host of 

the conservative news outlet Newsmax — 

took a dig at Champ, Biden’s 12-year-old 

dog. Kelly and presidential historian Craig 

Shirley labeled Champ as unpresidential, 

saying he looks like he is “from the 

junkyard.”

In response to both Kelly and Shirley: 

Find something better to do with your time 

than ridiculing the president’s elderly dog. 

Although I suppose they should not be 

surprising in the context of an increasingly 

petty and partisan political sphere in the 

U.S., these comments were ridiculous. 

Criticizing a president’s dogs is crude and 

criticizing Champ as ‘unpresidential’ is 

simply incorrect. If not an American icon, 

dogs are most certainly a presidential 

staple. 

German shepherds have long been 

considered a favorite amongst Americans 

in several categories, for both their loyalty 

and intelligence. Most police canine units 

country-wide, including the Michigan State 

Police, rely on German shepherds for their 

high work rate and intelligent problem-

solving abilities — two ideal presidential 

qualities. So, if Champ’s smarts were at all 

in question, they shouldn’t be. This is also 

not the first time a German shepherd has 

been a resident of the White House. Former 

presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and John 

F. Kennedy also had German shepherds — 

they were certainly considered adequate 

presidential pets at the time. 

If it was his physical appearance, give 

Champ a break. He is 12 years old — that 

is well into his 80s in human years. Would 

you go up to your grandpa and say he 

was junkyard-like or looking as if he was 

uncared for simply because he looked old? 

No. It should be normal for an old dog to 

look, well, old. One of my dogs is starting to 

become a bit feeble, but I am certainly not 

going to ridicule her for it. 

Personal attacks have sadly become 

the new norm in politics, it seems. We 

saw it consistently throughout the past 

two presidential elections; Vice President 

Kamala Harris was regularly mocked for 

her tone of voice, her name and her race — 

as were many politicians before her. 

It is frustrating that these attacks 

have become standard in the U.S. They 

reflect poorly on the character of both 

American politics and the intelligence of 

the American people as a whole. Our time 

is spent on narrow-minded, irrelevant 

jabs and Twitter comments, including 

Greg Kelly’s response to the backlash he 

received following his segment. 

But, if personal attacks are going to be 

a norm, so be it — it seems there is not 

much that can be done to buck that trend 

in a post-Trump America. With that being 

said, dogs need to be left out of those digs. 

A politician’s dogs are irrelevant to their 

politics and should only be discussed 

as a potential judge of character for any 

candidate. Using them simply as a way to 

belittle a president or politician is immoral. 

Instead, find a way to criticize Biden’s 

agenda or policies. That is the basis of 

what politics should be: informed debate 

regarding what legislation our elected 

officials should be passing. 

Rather, this is a wake-up call for the state 

of our political discourse in this country. It 

is time to bring back some intelligence to our 

discussions. Leave Biden’s dogs alone. Dogs 

have only served to be a positive American 

icon within the White House — Major and 

Champ are no different. 

A

fter 
deciding 
to 
check 

Facebook following weeks of 
being offline, I immediately 

saw an opinion article one of my 
former classmates shared with the title: 
“Transgender athletes don’t belong in 
girls’ sports. Let my daughter compete 
fairly.” Immediately, the author claimed 
that allowing “biological boys’’ to 
participate in girls’ sports is the exact 
opposite of gender equality and destroys 
years of progress for girls in athletics. 
The article then framed the landmark 
Supreme Court decision that banned 
employment 
discrimination 
based 

on gender identity, which preceded 
this development, as unfortunate. 
Then, it pronounced sex as defined by 
our bodies’ DNA. That, however, is a 
classic example of pseudoscience used 
to justify continuous transphobia by 
claiming sex can be boiled down to a 
binary definition. 

Opponents of trans rights often miss 

three key indicators when it comes to 
determining a person’s sex according 
to science: genetics, endocrinology 
and neurobiology. Basic biology taught 
us that those with XX chromosomes 
are females, while those with XY 
chromosomes are males. But what 
about other combinations of Xs and 

Ys? What about the various strengths 
of male-differentiating genes? What 
about studies proving transgender 
people’s brains more closely resemble 
the gender they identify as? 

However, 
challengers 
of 

transgender rights will point to 
psychology with the claim that being 
trans is a coping mechanism for gender 
dysphoria 
and 
body 
dysmorphia. 

However, many of these studies have 
already been dismissed for ethical 
reasons and numerous public health 
organizations are steadily working 
toward 
declassifying 
transgender 

identity as a psychological disorder. On 
the other hand, reevaluation of former 
psychological studies has revealed 
that gender-based discrimination and 
violence is most often the root cause of 
mental illness within the transgender 
community. 

In the contentious debate over 

whether 
self-proclaimed 
gender 

identity should be respected, the idea of 
feminism has been called into question. 
Political 
activist 
and 
American 

journalist Gloria Steinem defines a 
feminist as “anyone who recognizes 
the equality and full humanity of 
women and men.” Unfortunately, that 
sentiment is not universal across all self-

identifying feminist groups. 

One of the most infamous includes 

TERFs, an acronym that stands for 
Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist, a 
group that has repeatedly euphemized 
themselves 
as 
“gender 
critical 

feminists.” TERFs have increasingly 
divided the feminist movement, leading 
to controversy over who falls under the 
protection of feminism.

Harry Potter fans may have noticed a 

very prominent display of TERF ideology 
when “cancel culture” swarmed J.K. 
Rowling in June after she posted a tweet 
implying that true women menstruate. 
However, instead of providing the 
typical mediocre apology and claiming 
innocent ignorance, Rowling doubled-
down on her stance, claiming “It isn’t 
hate to speak the truth.” This ignited a 
torrent of fuming subtweets between 
defenders of Rowling and supporters 
of trans rights, with both sides calling 
themselves feminists. However, the 
dueling perspectives concerning J.K. 
Rowling and her tweets invoke the 
uncomfortable, yet inescapable, roots of 
feminism. 

Simply put, the feminist movement 

was rooted in a philosophy founded on 
the principles of white supremacy and 
bigotry. The second wave of feminism 

in the 1960s and 70s was dominated 
by white women, who utilized the 
inferiority of their sex in a progressive 
age as an aegis to perpetuate their own 
prejudices. This feminism aimed at 
promoting the voices of its constituents 
who were usually limited to the 
demographics of middle class, white 
and heterosexual. In its beginning, the 
movement never incorporated minority 
women, and certainly would not have 
considered transwomen among its 
ranks. 

Despite public resistance to the 

TERFs’ approach toward transgender 
people, 
the 
consequences 
of 
its 

internalized ideology have led to 
de facto inequality including the 
trans military ban, removal from the 
workplace, discrimination in health 
care and “bathroom bills.” Here at the 
University of Michigan, it is apparent 
when professors use the wrong 
pronouns despite the correct ones 
placed beside names on attendance 
sheets and then excuse themselves for 
being “old-fashioned.” Or, for example, 
when trans people are asked their 
“preferred” name and pronouns instead 
of simply name and pronouns. 

On Jan. 20, President Joe Biden made 

a national effort to combat transphobia 

through an executive order combatting 
“discrimination on the basis of gender 
identity or sexual orientation.” Soon 
after, “#BidenErasedWomen” began 
to trend on Twitter with intolerance 
disguising itself under the shroud of 
feminism to attack the advancement of 
equal rights. 

With the passage of the Equality 

Act on Feb. 25 by the House of 
Representatives, the battle between 
supporters and opponents of trans rights 
was reinvigorated. These so-called 
feminists that oppose the president’s 
executive order and the Equality Act 
were outraged at lawmakers for putting 
cis girls and women at risk by allowing 
trans women to play sports and use 
bathrooms according to the gender 
with which they identify. Instead, 
opponents prefer to keep trans people 
as the marginalized and severely 
oppressed community that they have 
always been. 

No, Biden has not erased women. 

Comparatively, 
the 
president 
has 

given validation to the existence of 
trans people across the United States 
who have been constantly ridiculed, 
questioned mercilessly and abused for 
decades. In the words of renowned 
anti-racist activist Franklin Leonard, 

“When you are accustomed to privilege, 
equality feels like oppression.” 

The “feminists” that feel as though 

they are facing discrimination remain 
trapped in the delusions of second-wave 
feminism. They pursue a narrative that 
is substantiated by neither biology 
nor psychology to maintain hostility 
toward transgender people, all while 
pretending to advocate for the rights of 
women. 

Therefore, to truly be a feminist 

in the 21st century, people must first 
acknowledge the history of hate and 
discrimination feminism has fostered. 
From there, it is possible to build upon 
the faults of the past to construct a more 
inclusive and forceful wave of gender 
reckoning.

But let one thing be clear: You are 

neither an ally nor a feminist if you 
pick and choose the circumstances in 
which it is acceptable for trans women 
to have equality. Feminism advocates 
for all women regardless of surgeries, 
hormonal treatments, menstruation 
or appearance. Transgender women 
are women and deserve the same 
recognition from society as cis women.

T

hrough speaking with my peers 

and friends, I know I am not 

alone in thinking for a long time 

that things would be relatively “normal” 

by this summer. Especially with the 

beginning of the vaccine rollout in 

December, I was confident that by June 

I would be vaccinated and the pandemic 

would be much more under control. 

While the daily number of new 

COVID-19 cases in the United States 

has decreased, the vaccine rollout 

has problems. With the University of 

Michigan still in Phase 1b of vaccinations 

and the continuous weekly emails 

about how the University is behind 

on its original vaccination goals, I am 

now skeptical that I will be able to get 

the vaccine by the end of the winter 

semester. 

One summer in a pandemic was 

difficult enough for college students. 

Internships were canceled, travelling 

and immersive experiences were put 

on hold, and any programming that did 

happen was mostly remote. When I 

began my search for what I wanted to do 

this summer, most programs mentioned 

that they would likely be virtual and that 

there was still a chance of them being 

canceled last minute given the level of 

uncertainty surrounding the future state 

of the pandemic.

Summer programs are usually a time 

for college students to try out fields of 

interest and explore what they want to 

do after college. Whether an internship 

is a good or bad experience, it allows the 

student to gain clarity on what they want 

to study and pursue. Two summers in a 

pandemic could prevent college students 

from gaining hands-on experience to 

enhance their studies and confirm that 

they are on the right track. Because many 

undergraduate students were unable 

to participate in summer internships 

or programming last summer, there is 

a lot of pressure to find something this 

summer. Whether or not a program gets 

canceled is mostly based on luck, but the 

students who are able to gain experience 

to add to their résumé will be ahead of 

those who aren’t as lucky.

In my experience, reliable, engaging 

and in-person internships are extremely 

hard to find. Furthermore, the few I 

did find were extremely competitive 

because options are so limited. The 

summer application process has been 

a point of stress and anxiety for many 

students this school year. 

Even if a majority of internships 

are not canceled this summer, the 

likelihood of them being in-person and 

offering the programming they would 

in “normal” times seems unlikely. When 

adapting to a pandemic world, in-person 

internships will have to sacrifice parts 

of their programming such as large 

meetings, collaborative projects and 

team building that would normally 

enrich the internship experience. And 

internships that are fully remote and 

involve staring at a screen all day make 

it challenging for students to evaluate if 

this is a field they want to pursue further. 

There are multiple consequences of 

these pandemic summers that could 

have serious implications for the futures 

of current undergraduate students. 

One potential impact is that students 

will not be able to determine if they 

dislike an industry or career path during 

college. Internships help students decide 

whether a career is appealing to them, so 

not having that opportunity could lead 

many to make mistakes in their first job 

out of college.

Another potential consequence of 

not being able to engage in hands-on 

immersive summer experiences is that 

students may need to try out different 

fields and industries after graduation, 

since they did not have the opportunity 

during their college summers. Getting 

a job out of college is already stressful, 

and now it will be many students’ first 

time working in the field outside of an 

academic setting. Many might have to 

test multiple jobs post-graduation to truly 

figure out what they want to pursue.

While virtual internships still offer 

experience and useful skills, to me, 

the possibility of an entire summer on 

Zoom did not seem worth the benefits. I 

began looking at outdoor non-academic 

experiences that have, so far, seemed 

less likely to be canceled and can take 

place in-person. Summer jobs such as 

working at a camp or in a national park 

and programs such as Outward Bounds, 

Northern Outdoor Leadership School 

and Overland offer a break from Zoom 

and an environment that is much easier 

modified to follow pandemic guidelines. 

A worry for many college students 

when considering outdoor programs 

compared to a job or internship in 

their field is that they will not develop 

applicable skills to their studies and 

that their résumé will not be as strong. 

However, students have the remainder 

of their lives to work in an office 

environment and develop technical 

skills. Working as a camp counselor or 

leading an outdoor expedition provides 

participants with experience regarding 

leadership, responsibility, delegation 

and independence that are applicable to 

most work environments. 

Undergraduate 
students 
must 

understand that if they are unable to 

find the perfect internship or academic 

program this summer, it is not a 

reflection of their application but rather 

the challenges employers are facing in 

offering internships. Even internships 

themselves may not offer the experience 

and growth they would in normal times 

and alternative summer plans should be 

embraced as a great and unique option.

K

inesiology senior Alexander 
Phillips began working as 
an EMT in December 2019, 

just months before the COVID-19 pan-
demic swept the United States and 
altered our lives forever. As part of the 
typical testing protocol for new EMTs, 
he was fitted with personal protective 
equipment, including a respirator. At 
the time, it was business as usual.

“I was tested with (the respirator) 

to make sure it functions and every-
thing,” Phillips said. “I’m thinking like, 
okay, I’m probably not gonna use that 
very often.”

But within a few months, that PPE 

switched from a mandatory guideline 
to a scarce, crucial resource, as the 
U.S. and Michigan experienced a ris-
ing number of COVID-19 cases. Phil-
lips, who is studying Athletic Train-
ing, recalled these turbulent first few 
months of work in a Zoom call with 
The Michigan Daily.

“(The pandemic) was just con-

stantly changing at that point, it was 
like you’d wake up every day and the 
news will be saying something dif-
ferent,” Phillips recalled. “And it was 
pretty much the same thing at work. 
It was pretty chaotic … it just felt like 
there was so much information hap-
pening so quickly.”

Phillips wasn’t the only student 

who took their medical studies to 
the workforce during the pandemic, 
but some had more trouble finding 
ways to help, like LSA junior Stephen 
Moss, studying Molecular, Cellular 
and Developmental Biology. Stephen 
received his EMT license at the end 
of February 2020, around the time the 
pandemic began to encroach on life in 
Ann Arbor. 

“As soon as I tried to find a job, I was 

just thrown right off the deep end into 
the pandemic,” Moss said as we spoke 
over Zoom. “I had just got my license 
and then everything shut down, and 
the place I wanted to go work at put in 
a hiring freeze because they couldn’t 
afford to hire more people.”

After spending months applying 

for jobs and volunteer positions at 
ERs and field hospitals in Michigan 
to no avail, Moss returned to his home 
state of Rhode Island, where he finally 
found some luck volunteering for the 
Medical Reserve Corps. By then, it 
was already May, and Moss was eager 
to get to work.

“One thing that was just really 

weird to me was how hard it was to 
find a way to help,” Moss said. “I mean, 
I was looking for a job, I like getting 
paid for my work, but I was also just 
looking for a way to help, and it was 
astonishingly difficult to do that.”

Moss described getting trained by 

the National Guard and being placed 
at a testing site in the parking lot of 
a senior center. At the time, the U.S. 
was experiencing PPE shortages, and 
Moss recalled trying not to waste his 
equipment while working for hours 
in the summer heat.

“Every day we were out there in 

like, 80-degree heat, in these enor-
mous hazmat suits, head to toe,” Moss 
said. “Everyone had one face shield 
that you cleaned … We had to wear six 
pairs of gloves. You had three base lay-
ers, and then you had your suit on top, 
and then you had three more. And it 
was very hard to manage all of that.”

If you are someone like me, who 

is not studying medicine or involved 
in health care work, it can be diffi-
cult to imagine standing face-to-face 
with COVID-19 patients, respond-
ing to 911 calls that report shortness 
of breath or administering one nasal 

swab test after another. It’s scary to 
picture being in such close proximity 
to danger, suffering and even death. 
It’s part of the reason we tend to char-
acterize health care workers as su-
perheroes; we view them as unafraid, 
charging into turmoil and emerging 
unscathed. 

Dr. Janice Firn, a clinical assis-

tant professor in the Department of 
Learning Health Sciences and a clini-
cal ethicist at the Center for Bioethics 
& Social Sciences in Medicine at the 
University of Michigan, said some-
times the heroizing of health care 
workers can become problematic.

“A system can take advantage of 

people if we praise them for their self-
sacrificing, but then we start penaliz-
ing people who won’t play the game 
or ‘sacrifice to that level’ when actu-
ally maybe they’re just being healthy,” 
Dr. Firn said. 

Indeed, data has shown that dur-

ing the pandemic, health care work-
ers have experienced elevated rates of 
PTSD, anxiety, depression and other 
mental health conditions. Some have 
even quit their jobs due to high stress 
and burnout. 

“With the people that don’t re-

ally understand or know about health 
care, it feels like there’s a reduction of 
health care to a quantitative, check-
ing boxes kind of thing, where it’s like, 
‘We have the ventilators, we have the 
ICU beds, we’re good,’” Phillips said. 
“And it’s frustrating seeing the more 
human side of that, and going into 
hospitals and talking to the nurses and 
working with co-workers who are 
just so exhausted and burnt out from 
literally a year of doing this, because 
that’s the qualitative side of it that is 
hard to describe.”
T

he way we portray health 
care providers, and our 
subsequent expectations 

of them, originates from a historical 
and social narrative, as doctors and 
nurses have been viewed as healers 
for thousands of years. Hippocrates, 
an ancient Greek physician and one 

of the leading figures in the history 
of medicine, urged that doctors have 
two main tasks in treating patients: 
“to do good or to do no harm.” But 
what does “good” mean, and what 
does it mean to be a good provider? 
Is it casting aside one’s own needs for 
that of the patient? Is it stepping away 
when the burden becomes too heavy 
for effective work? These dilemmas 
loom even larger in the context of a 
rapidly changing, high-stress situa-
tion like a global pandemic.

I wondered, then, how these pres-

sures fall onto students like Moss 
and Phillips, whose first experiences 
providing health care — before they 
even start their formal careers — are 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
How do these accelerated lessons in 
witnessing pain and loss impact their 
psyches? How do they grapple with 
seeing suffering at work while their 
neighbors on campus throw parties? 
How do they understand the virus 
medically while making sense of the 
pandemic socially?

I spoke with five students who 

work on the frontlines — EMTs, nurs-
ing assistants, medical technicians, 
those who administer COVID-19 test-
ing — to explore these questions. And 
while each interview was humbling, 
giving hints of that all-familiar hero-
ism, I felt a sense of heaviness behind 
their words.

“Even with the medical field, I 

think it’s going to be a long process 
to recover from it,” Nursing senior 
Rebecca Petrella said. “Not even just 
cost wise, but mental health wise, for 
everyone who went through it. And 
it’s hard to think that I’m just about to 
start off my medical career because I 
already, in a sense, feel burnt out from 
having to go through all of this.”

***
Petrella started working as a pa-

tient care technician (also known as 
a nurse’s assistant) at the beginning 
of March 2020. Within a week of the 
new job, she was told their floor, an 
adult pulmonary and general medi-

cine unit, would be filled solely with 
COVID-19 patients. 

“I had about a week of orienta-

tion, which was normal,” Petrella said. 
“And then I came back the next week 
and they were like, ‘Yeah we’re all CO-
VID now. Is that fine with you?’ And I 
was like, ‘I guess.’”

Petrella described the energy in 

the hospital for those first few months 
of the pandemic as nervous and un-
certain. And while she didn’t worry 
too much about getting sick herself, 
Petrella told me the fear of infecting 
others kept her isolated for most of 
the summer.

“All my friends went home, and I 

didn’t have family here, and I was re-
ally worried about passing it to other 
people,” Petrella said. “So I basically 
went to work and my apartment the 
whole time, and it was really hard 
mental health wise.”

That isolation was compounded 

by what she saw at work — patients 
struggling with or dying from COV-
ID-19, some being moved to the ICU, 
others asking her if they would die. 

“
Just hearing patients’ stories 

about everything was really hard and 
really sad,” Petrella said. “I was very 
much in my own headspace and in-
ternalizing a lot of things … As a nurse, 
you’re told to leave work at work, and 
that’s sometimes really hard to do.”

While incoming health care work-

ers are trained to deal with the pain, 
grief or death of their patients, being 
thrust onto a COVID-19 floor as an un-
dergraduate is a new phenomenon, to 
say the least. And yet, one of the most 
celebrated traits of health care profes-
sionals — one especially heightened 
during the pandemic — is adaptability.

“At this point, what I’ve gotten way 

better at doing is separating myself 
from patients,” Petrella explained. 
“And I can still feel that empathy with 
them while I’m with them, but after 
that I need to just leave it behind me 
and think about the general picture of 
everything that’s going on.”

Nursing senior Reagan Cloutier 

expressed a similar sentiment when 
we spoke over Zoom. Cloutier, who is 
the president of the Student Nurses’ 
Association, works as a nursing assis-
tant at the C.S. Mott Children’s Hos-
pital. Throughout the pandemic, the 
floor she works on has admitted both 
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pedi-
atric patients.

While children experience mild-

er COVID-19 reactions than adults, 
many of Cloutier’s patients are chron-
ically ill, and are thus at greater risk 
for complications if afflicted with the 
virus. Cloutier described how one 
of her greatest fears during the pan-
demic is that she will unintentionally 
infect one of these patients with COV-
ID-19. But despite this anxiety and the 
tense energy in the hospital, Cloutier 
spoke confidently about her work as a 
nursing assistant.

“Being resilient health care pro-

viders is really important because … 
you’re not going to see a patient die 
every day of your career, but you cer-
tainly are going to deal with heavy 
stuff almost every day of your career, 
and it’s good to know and have the 
skill set to be able to deal with that,” 
Cloutier said.

Nurses often spend the most face-

to-face time with patients, especially 
during the pandemic, when the hos-
pital limits the number of people 
such as visitors allowed in COVID-19 
rooms. For that reason, nurses are not 
only providing medical attention and 
information, but also emotional and 
social support. Of course, this means 
that they bear witness to — and help 
mitigate — tough situations. 

“It’s important as a nurse to in-

ternalize those things your patients 
are telling you, but it’s also important 
to protect yourself, so that you know 
that’s not coming home and affecting 
your day-to-day life,” Cloutier said. 
“And that you’re able to come home 
and enjoy your life and not necessar-
ily live in your patient’s grief or live in 
your patient’s concerns or worries.”

It’s a mentality that takes time 

to build, according to Dr. Firn, who 
spoke about the training of young 
health care professionals in dealing 
with patient loss and pain.

“I don’t think we necessarily go 

into these sort of service positions 
thinking we’re going to help people 
die,” Dr. Firn said. “That’s a lot of what 
health care is, but I don’t think we do 
a good job of training folks in an area 
where we can talk about it.”

Dr. Firn mentioned that pre-clini-

cal exposure to topics in grief and loss 
can help health care professionals 
better react and empathize with pa-
tients. She noted a course like this that 
she took during her own education in 
medicine and social work, which she 
said had significant impacts on her 
clinical work. 

“It did help me, sitting with those 

uncomfortable feelings,” Dr. Firn said. 
“And sort of playing out those sce-
narios meant that I had done some 
of the pre-work, so I could be more 
present to patients and families in the 
moment.”

But Dr. Firn noted that it’s diffi-

cult to mimic this gradual, classroom 
introduction to grief during the pan-
demic; and while Cloutier and Petrel-
la both indicated that the pandemic 
had strengthened their emotional du-
rability, I wondered if it was enough, 
considering how new they are to the 
workforce.

Nostalgia in the time of COVID

BY EMILY BLUMBERG, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

I

t was yet another lonely, end-
less night in the spring of 2020 
spent 
mindlessly 
rewatching 

“Parks and Recreation” for the third 
time. The painfully familiar feeling 
of restlessness washed over me — 
my glossy eyes began to burn from 
countless hours of screen time and 
my brain’s insatiable appetite for 
unachievable social stimulation had 
returned. I shifted my position in 
my teal and pink chevron-patterned 
childhood bed as a desperate attempt 
to feel any remote sense of change. 
All was calm and yet little was well. 

Suddenly, a sound I hadn’t heard 

since my preschool days blared out 
of my phone’s speaker: the gritty, 
pixelated music of early 2000s chil-
dren’s computer games. I felt a rush 
of serotonin as I pulled a long forgot-
ten memory out of my brain’s deep-
est crevices. For the first time in the 
weeks since the shutdowns of mid-
March 2020, I had actually felt some-
thing. 

I had randomly stumbled upon 

a TikTok showcasing an old Holly 
Hobbie game I suddenly remembered 
playing as a kid on an account called 
@noughtienostalgia. 
Hearing 
the 

forgotten yet familiar “Hi! I’m Holly! 
And I’m Perri. Amy here! And we’re 
the Hey Girls!” was the most exciting 
event I had experienced in almost 
three months. It whisked me right 
back to staring at my dad’s clunky old 
computer, choosing sparkly dresses 
for my Polly Pockets and baking cup-
cakes with Barbie. 

The pure, unadulterated excite-

ment of rediscovering a silly, mind-
less computer game I hadn’t played 
in over a decade allowed me to travel 
back to what felt like simpler times. 
For just one minute, it was if I had 

reverted back to being four years old, 
pink Barbie brand glasses and all. 

I spent the rest of that lonely night 

diving deep into the abyss of child-
hood memories on the brink of be-
ing forgotten. I chased that nostalgic 
high until I had drained every ounce 
of my curiosity. 

Nostalgia is an undoubtedly and 

underratedly powerful emotion. It’s 
what drives your best friend to get 
back with their clearly problematic 
ex-boyfriend and what convinces col-
lege students to blast Hannah Mon-
tana’s Greatest Hits at pregames. It 
gives bygone music artists the chance 
to milk their last profits through re-
union tours and draws viewers’ at-
tention to bland reboots of once 
successful TV shows, like “Fuller 
House” or “Arrested Development: 
Fateful Consequences.” It’s what 
drove me to spend an embarrassing 
amount of time trying to redownload 
Adobe Flash Player on my computer 
so I could play “Holly Hobbie and 
Friends Muffin Maker.”

Nostalgia, defined by Oxford Lan-

guages as a sentimental longing or 
wistful affection for the past, can 
be a positive emotion. Studies have 
shown that nostalgia in healthy doses 
can provide us with feelings of conti-
nuity and purpose in our lives. 

As New York Times columnist John 

Tierney wrote in his piece “What is 
Nostalgia Good For?”: “When people 
speak wistfully of the past, they typi-
cally become more optimistic and in-
spired about the future.” 

Hearing songs or seeing photos 

that spark old memories of an el-
ementary school graduation or fam-
ily vacation can remind us of how 
far we’ve come. Acknowledging our 
pasts allows us to understand the 

scope of our lives and find meaning 
in personal growth and development. 
It prompts us to reconnect with old, 
cherished friends and appreciate 
what may seem like simpler times.
I 

felt trapped in my childhood 
home and chose to spend my 
days unproductively waiting for 

an alternate reality to swoop in and 
create some miraculous COVID-19 
cure that, of course, never arrived. 
Rediscovering those silly, low-qual-
ity Holly Hobbie games gave me a 
sense of purpose in a time of extreme 
uncertainty. Reminding myself of 
such a random yet warm childhood 
experience inspired me to appreciate 
every moment of that forced family 
time I could because I would hope-
fully be leaving for college in a few 
short months. I was put back on track 
and focusing on how I could make the 
most of our family quarantine rather 
than angrily ponder what experienc-
es I was being forced to miss. Those 
games brought me back to simply be-
ing young, easily fascinated by every 
object, activity and person that en-
tered my life; but more importantly, 
they reminded me of the atmosphere 
of my childhood — the comfortable 
feeling of being entrenched in famil-
ial love. It reminded me to be eternal-
ly grateful for the endless sacrifices 
made out of compassion so that I 
could go to school each day and come 
home excited to experience the fun 
that was in store. My parents worked 
tirelessly to ensure my happiness, 
even in times of extreme financial 
difficulty like the 2008 recession. My 
grandparents came over rather than 
spending a night with their friends 
to give my parents a break, simul-
taneously providing me with all the 
love I could dream of. And the ironic 

beauty of it all is that they were so 
successful that my biggest concerns 
as a child were choosing what color 
icing to put on my virtual Holly Hob-
bie muffins.

In an interview with The Michi-

gan Daily, Hollis Griffin, an LSA 
Communication and Media profes-
sor, discussed how we often utilize 
nostalgia as a comforting tool to 
soften the blow of a currently stress-
ful reality. 

“I think there’s a way of looking 

back that is understanding the past 
as somehow simpler and more desir-
able than the present moment,” Grif-
fin said. “We tend to look back when 
we’re nervous about what’s going on 
around us in the present, and there’s 
a way in which when you’re nervous 
about, express trepidation about or 
have kind of wary cautious feelings 
about something going on in your 
immediate surroundings, there’s a 
way in which looking back is deeply 
comforting.”

Nostalgia can be wonderful. It can 

bring us back to our roots and revive 
our excitement for the pure, simple 
joys of being alive. But like anything, 
excessive focus on the past can hin-
der our personal progress. Spending 
our days reminiscing may cause us to 
neglect the necessity of moving for-
ward. 

When does it get to be too much? 

When does rewatching “Friends” for 
the nth time transition from harm-
less reminiscence into an emotional 
downward spiral driven by rever-
sion? Where is the line between ap-
preciation and excessive longing for 
times we will never get back? 

It’s tempting to get wrapped up 

in reliving what seems like the glo-
ry days, particularly in a pandemic, 
where daily life often feels simul-
taneously monotoaI have spent so 
much of this time reminiscing on 
simpler days that I have lost almost a 
year and counting’s worth of poten-
tial memories. 

Hollis also noted humans’ tenden-

cy to oversimplify the past. When I 
think about that Holly Hobbie game 
and its association with the warm 
love of my family and early child-
hood, it’s easy to quietly disregard 
the time’s miserable meltdowns and 
ever-present stress.

“I think that there’s a way of see-

ing the past that way as being sim-
pler than it was a lot of times,” Hol-
lis said. “It doesn’t mean the past 
was without its problems, it means 
that the conditions of the present 
are looking at the past in particular 
ways.”

After hearing from Hollis and giv-

ing it more thought, I believe what 
we have learned and experienced in 
our past is necessary to propel us to 
elevated personal happiness and suc-
cess, but our past should not prevent 
us from advancing to the nextstages 
of our lives. The past is an indispens-
able mechanism for learning and 
growth so long as we use it wisely 
and moderately. 

A rewatch of your favorite Disney 

Channel show or a scream-singing 
session of 2000s pop hits may not 
clue us in on how to solve a global 
pandemic, but they can, and have, 
kept our endurance high in these infi-
nitely trying times. When the present 
reality feels suffocating and stressful, 
sometimes the best escape is to allow 
ourselves, even just for a moment, to 
revert back to the simple joys of be-
ing an imaginative, naïve child. Nos-
talgia essentially provides us with 
the chance to time travel, allowing 
us to rediscover the brightest aspects 
of our past in order to motivate and 
comfort us in the present.

O

f all the unnecessary wor-
ries I had going into my 
freshman year at the Uni-

versity of Michigan (and there 
were a lot), the one I now laugh 
at most is that I wouldn’t like Ann 
Arbor. Having grown up in a major 
metropolitan area, I was hesitant 
about going to school in a college 
town.

As if it’s possible to not like Ann 

Arbor.

This place means something dif-

ferent for all of us who’ve lived 
here, certainly, but something I 
especially love is how much his-
tory is embedded in the city — how 
many people have walked these 
streets, have discovered my favor-
ite hole-in-the-wall restaurants, 
have pulled all-nighters in my fa-
vorite study spots before I arrived. 
I love that idea — that I am becom-
ing one of so many people that have 
been shaped by this place.

Something I love even more is 

that the people who live in Ann 
Arbor shape the town as much as 
it shapes those who temporarily 
stay. The energy in these streets is 
somehow more malleable, more at-
tuned to the specific group that’s 
here right now than to the count-
less faces that came before. Maybe 
that’s just the nature of a college 
town, but it’s still amazing to think 
about what Ann Arbor used to be 
like and what we could help it be-
come.

One of my favorite times to pic-

ture is the Ann Arbor of the late 
60s. I’m an avid fan of what my 
friends have jokingly termed “dad 
music” — Creedence Clearwater 
Revival, The Doors, The Beach 
Boys, basically any music that re-
sulted from the Vietnam War — 
and seeing photographs from The 
Michigan Daily of the University 
in those days sparked that interest 
even more.

With this in mind, you can imag-

ine how excited I was to learn that 
Bob Seger, singer of “Old Time 
Rock & Roll” and numerous of my 
other dad playlist staples, is from 
Ann Arbor.

I immediately started listening 

through his songs, on guard for 

anything that might be about Ann 
Arbor. After doing some research, 
I was able to piece together a 
Bob Seger’s Ann Arbor tour, so to 
speak. It’s beautiful how this place 
that’s shaped me so much has also 
shaped some of the music I love.

The song “Mainstreet” was writ-

ten about a little old jazz club on 
West Ann and North Main Streets, 
where Seger used to listen to a per-
former known to everyone in town 
as Washboard Willie. There’s a 
certain wistfulness to the opening 
guitar riff. You can almost picture 
it echoing down the quiet streets, 
the soft piano chords underneath 
it as solid as the footsteps on the 
pilgrimage home.

“Standin’ on the corner at mid-

night / Tryin’ to get my courage up 
…”

That club is long gone now, and 

the dreamy dancer Seger longs for 
has long since disappeared into 
the chords of life. Instead, there’s 
a party store with faded awnings 
and crackling window paint at that 
intersection, a brick building cast-
ing a shadow over the juncture. 
There’s a hotel across the street, 
the kind where visiting parents or 
alumni or businessmen might stay 
when they come into town.

But somehow, the sort of hazy, 

hopeful scene that the song sets 
up doesn’t feel that far off. Sure, 
it might not be happening in the 
exact same place, but even now, 
decades on, something of Seger’s 
sentiment still rings true. Walking 
these streets at night, the everyday 
commotion not gone, but softened, 
wondering about the lives of pass-
ersby — that Ann Arbor scene still 
happens, still shapes us, still com-
pels us into that same wistful won-
dering that’s audible on Seger’s re-
cord.

“Sometimes even now, when I’m 

feelin’ lonely and beat / I drift back 
in time and I find my feet / Down 
on Main Street …”

Seger grew up in the neighbor-

hood along Packard Street. He’d 
frequent Blue Front, the old conve-
nience-store-turned-craft-beer oa-
sis, with his brother; it was an easy 
walk from their home. Another of 

Seger’s old haunts is still as much 
an institution in 2021 Ann Arbor 
as it was in the 1960s. Brown Jug 
Restaurant at the corner of Church 
Street and South University Av-
enue is today just as beloved as the 
music of Seger, their former pizza 
delivery boy. Although Brown Jug 
declined to comment for this story 
and Seger’s music rarely plays at 
the restaurant these days, it still 
somehow seems fitting that he was 
involved with this Ann Arbor sta-
ple; it seems right that he, like so 
many of us, has memories of nights 
centered on this place.

Brown Jug isn’t the only long-

standing legacy Seger grew up 
with. The singer also used to play 
concerts at the University’s fra-
ternities. Chris Cioe, the musician 
and writer who provided jazz in-
strumentals to The B-52’s and The 
Manhattans, among others, vividly 
remembers seeing Seger, clad in 
“skin-tight black jeans, a turtle-
neck and a blue Beatles style cap — 
the quintessential greaser-rocker,” 
performing on the front lawn of 
the Chi Phi house at 1530 Washt-
enaw.
T

hese days, the music echo-
ing out of the old stone 
structure might tend more 

towards Chance the Rapper than 
Creedence 
Clearwater 
Revival, 

more towards hip-hop than old-
time rock ‘n’ roll. But if you think 
hard enough about what this scene 
might’ve looked like in 1966, it’s 
not so hard to picture Seger play-
ing on those front steps. It’s not 
so hard to imagine the twanging 
of the guitar floating out across 
the busy street as the brothers and 
their dates danced in the sunshine, 
caught at that exciting juncture 
between culture and countercul-
ture that came to define their gen-
eration, both shaping and being 
shaped by Ann Arbor.

Seger’s fingerprints are also still 

visible at Pioneer High School, 
which Seger attended back when it 
was still Ann Arbor High. He let-
tered in track and field, graduat-
ing in 1963. You can still find his 
photograph in the yearbook. It 
makes all of this a little more real: 

He really was here. Those lyrics 
really are about this town. You re-
ally have seen the same landscape, 
walked the same streets.

That shared experience is wist-

fully portrayed by “Night Moves,” 
one of Seger’s most-loved songs, 
and arguably one of his best. Its 
longing lyrics and the vivid scenes 
of late nights sneaking away when-
ever possible still feels like a real 
account of what it means to be 
young.

“Workin’ on our night moves / 

Tryin’ to lose the awkward teenage 
blues …”

The song was inspired by “grass-

ers” that Seger and his friends 
held in high school, out on Zeeb 
Road. They turned on the head-
lights, played records from the car, 
drank, smoked and danced. “Night 
Moves” is simultaneously an ide-
alizing tribute to that youthful 
rebellion and a sincere, profound 
rendering of it.

“We weren’t searchin’ for some 

pie in the sky, or summit / We were 
just young and restless and bored 
/ Livin’ by the sword / And we’d 
steal away every chance we could 
/ To the backroom, the alley, the 
trusty woods …”

As I reached the end of the Bob 

Seger tour, it felt as if it truly came 
full circle, from the wistful longing 
of “Mainstreet” all the way back 
around to the earnest remembrance 
of “Night Moves.” The songs seem 
to have the same energy as Seger 
intended when they were initially 
created, somehow — the same bit-
tersweet recollection of earlier, 
less complicated, but no less mean-
ingful days. The honest version of 
Ann Arbor we see in Seger’s lyrics 
that still affects us years down the 
road seemed a fitting place to end.

Maybe this candid sentimental-

ity is why Seger’s music has en-
dured these many decades, because 
it’s Seger’s Ann Arbor that I’d most 
like to think is still accurate: Young 
people, still trying to figure their 
lives out, earnestly stumbling to-
wards some nebulous future, but 
just as sincerely trying to appreci-
ate the good days before we’ve ac-
tually left them.

REBECCA MAHON /Daily


Wolfe’s double overtime goal lifts 

Michigan over Nebraska

Raleigh Loughman carried 

the ball up the right wing with 

pace. The junior midfielder 

cut to her left on the edge of 

the box and looped in a cross 

that was knocked down by a 

Nebraska defender. Freshman 

forward 
Sammi 
Woods 

scooped up the loose ball and 

— without looking — tapped 

the ball with the back of her 

heel over towards a lurking 

Danielle Wolfe. 

The 
sophomore 
forward 

took one touch on the ball and 

fired a left-footed screamer 

into the top right corner of 

the Nebraska goal, putting an 

abrupt end to a 3-2 double-

overtime victory for Michigan 

(2-1-2 Big Ten) over Nebraska 

(1-2-1).

While Michigan ultimately 

prevailed, the first half made 

winning appear unlikely. In the 

second minute of play, junior 

defender Janiece Joyner overshot 

senior defensive partner Alia 

Martin on a cross-pitch pass 

just outside the Michigan box, 

perfectly setting up Nebraska 

forward Reagan Raabe for a 

first-touch shot that gave the 

Cornhuskers an early 1-0 lead. 

Ten minutes later, Raabe 

weaved 
through 
multiple 

Wolverine defenders but lost 

possession two yards outside 

the box, coming just short of 

doubling the Cornhuskers lead. 

In the 30th minute, though, 

the 
Wolverines 
received 
a 

modicum of karma. A Nebraska 

defender couldn’t clear the ball 

near the penalty spot, perfectly 

setting up freshman forward 

Kacey Lawrence for a high-

velocity 
strike 
that 
landed 

in the top left corner of the 

Nebraska net. Lawrence’s first 

career goal tied it up 1-1. 

Just 
one 
minute 
later, 

Cornhusker midfielder Dakota 

Chan 
connected 
with 
her 

teammate 
Marissa 
Popoola 

for a set-piece corner kick 

goal that gave Nebraska a 2-1 

lead. Popoola’s goal was a 

powerful header, giving senior 

goalkeeper Hillary Beall no 

opportunity to make a save on 

the shot. 

Despite trailing 2-1 at the 

half, Michigan came out firing 

on all cylinders at the start of 

the second. During the first 25 

minutes, Michigan racked up 

10 shots, compared to zero from 

Nebraska. One of those shots, 

a cross-net header by junior 

defender 
Sydney 
Shepherd, 

coming off of a Loughman 

corner kick, found the back 

of the net in the 60th minute, 

equalizing the score at 2-2. 

“We figured if we could 

make it through the first half, 

and get the wind (blowing) 

with us in the second half 

we would really give us a 

huge boost,” Michigan coach 

Jennifer Klein said. “I do think 

that it did (help us).”

Even-footed 
play 
during 

the next half hour resulted in 

a defensive struggle, sending 

the match to overtime. In the 

first overtime period, neither 

team put a shot on net. The 

Wolverines changed that in 

the second overtime period. 

They came out of the gate 

with 
an 
offensive 
barrage, 

sending three shots toward 

the Nebraska net. In the 104th 

minute, Wolfe hit the post. In 

the 105th, she hit the back of 

the net. 

“I (am) really proud of (the 

team’s) fight and grit,” Klein 

said. “They stayed the course 

and stuck to the game plan. 

We (got) the result so (I am) 

extremely proud of them.”

Neither goalkeeper played 

all too well today, as Michigan’s 

Beall and Nebraska’s Makinzie 

Short combined for five goals 

allowed but just six saves. 

At the end of the day, it all 

came down to momentum. 

Nebraska felt the hot hand 

early, Michigan caught fire 

during crunch time.

Transfers bolster lineup in 

opening series

Coming off draining competition at Winter Cup Challenge, Bock 

leads Michigan to win over Iowa

On 
March 
6, 
sophomore 

outfielder Jake Marti stepped 

into the batter’s box for the 

first time as a member of the 

Michigan baseball team — and 

as a Division I athlete. He’d 

spent the last two years raking at 

Heartland Community College, 

where he earned an All-Midwest 

Athletic Conference selection, 

but that’s no guarantee of 

success in the Division I game. 

“It’s a big jump coming from 

a junior college to this level,” 

Marti admitted. 

Still, in his first taste of 

Division I action, Marti looked 

right at home. On the first pitch 

he saw, he connected for a two-

run double that gave the No. 18 

Wolverines an early lead in their 

season opener against Iowa. 

Marti 
wasn’t 
the 
only 

transfer bat to help Michigan 

to its 3-1 weekend series 

victory. 
He 
and 
shortstop 

Benjamin 
Sems, 
catcher 

Griffin 
Mazur 
and 
third 

baseman Christian Molfetta 

— all fifth-year transfers — 

combined for a .334/.480/.590 

slash line and participated in 

several game-breaking rallies. 

“They’re here to fill some 

holes and plug some gaps, and 

that’s exactly what they did,” 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich 

said. 

When the Hawkeyes tied 

game one in the seventh 

inning, the Wolverines didn’t 

wait long before reclaiming 

the lead. After sophomore 

outfielder Tito Flores began 

the eighth with a double, he 

advanced to third off a bunt 

from Sems and driven in by a 

Molfetta single. 

“He’s a hell of a player and 

a versatile player,” Bakich 

said of Molfetta. “He stepped 

right into third base and 

filled in for (sophomore third 

baseman) Ted Burton,” who 

missed the series with an 

illness. “He made outstanding 

plays defensively and he had a 

ton of quality at-bats.”

After a quiet showing in 

game two, Michigan’s offense 

returned in game three, led by 

its transfers. With two outs 

and the bases loaded in the 

bottom of the second, it was 

Mazur’s turn for heroics; he 

crushed a changeup to left-

center field for a grand slam.

“We weren’t hurting for 

a hit, but we needed a hit to 

open things up, let everyone 

relax a little bit,” Mazur said 

in an interview posted on 

Michigan baseball’s Twitter 

account. 
“It 
was 
pretty 

awesome to get that first hit 

in a Michigan uniform. These 

guys have done nothing but 

accept me, and bring me into 

the team.”

Mazur’s 
coaches 
and 

teammates 
shared 
his 

enthusiasm for the highlight.

“He got voted one of the team 

captains, and his leadership is 

just off the charts,” Bakich said. 

“He’s a sparkplug, he gets big 

hits, he’s a clutch hitter. He’s a 

general out there on the field. 

He’s got all the intangible skills 

you would want.”

Added Flores: “You love to 

see your brother hit a homerun. 

… He’s a wonderful person, 

and that’s why he’s one of our 

captains on this team.”

By the final game of the series, 

Marti, Molfetta and Mazur were 

hitting first, third and fourth 

in the order, respectively. They 

joined Sems to combine for six 

runs and nine hits in a dominant 

11-4 win. 

None of this quartet had 

played for Michigan before, 

and one of them was new to 

Division I baseball entirely. 

But they needed just one series 

to 
establish 
themselves 
as 

cornerstones of the Wolverines’ 

offense. 

“It’s an awesome experience 

to come in here and know that 

I’m not alone, with all the 

transfers,” Marti said. “A bunch 

of new faces, making the lineup 

and 
just 
stringing 
together 

at-bats. I felt like we fed off each 

other’s energy really well all 

weekend, so that was really cool 

to see.”

Approaching 
his 
dismount 
off 

the pommel horse, senior Cameron 

Bock could hear the screams of 

encouragement from his teammates 

at the edge of the mat. He pushed 

himself up into a handstand on the 

horse, using the motivation from the 

sidelines, and ended the routine with 

a solid landing — earning a score of 

14.550, a new career high. 

Although 
the 
voices 
of 
his 

teammates 
helped 
motivate 
his 

routines during the Michigan men’s 

gymnastics win over No. 7 Iowa, 

Bock has also had to discipline 

himself to perform the same routines 

in almost complete silence. In the 

Winter Cup Challenge on Feb. 26-28, 

the 
atmosphere 
was 
completely 

different than that of a normal 

Michigan dual meet.

“Whenever someone goes up and 

does their routine (at a Michigan 

meet), everyone is yelling for them, 

you got the team support, it’s 

pretty loud,” Bock said. “In USA 

competitions, it’s almost dead silent. 

The music is low, you have maybe one 

or two other guys on your team there 

or your coach rooting you on, but it’s 

really just a different vibe.”

Both Bock and sophomore Paul 

Juda competed in the Winter Cup 

Challenge and were named part of 

the U.S. national team, with Bock 

placing first in the meet and Juda 

placing sixth. Bock competed in 

both days of the Winter Cup, as well 

as at a meet on Feb. 21 against No. 3 

Nebraska and No. 7 Illinois, for a total 

of three draining meets in a span of 

a week. With the meet this week 

against Iowa following the intense 

stretch, Bock did not compete on all 

events to allow for a break. 

“Our two main all around guys 

are Cameron Bock and Paul Juda, 

and they just finished a stretch of 

competition that was really grueling, 

really brutal,” Michigan coach Kurt 

Golder said. “Even if it weren’t — 

which it is — physically fatiguing, 

it’s mentally fatiguing because all 

of those meets were big pressure 

cookers.”

The strain of the last few meets did 

not seem to have much of an effect on 

Bock’s routines for the Wolverines on 

Saturday. Following his performance 

on the pommel horse, he tallied a 

14.400 on the still rings, sticking the 

landing on the dismount and getting 

a huge reaction from the team once 

again. Bock’s lowest-scoring event of 

the day was vault, where he scored 

a 14.150, but he finished his day off 

with a solid parallel performance, 

landing a solid double back pike 

dismount to post a score of 14.400. 

Bock competed last in the lineup on 

each event during the meet in order 

to stay consistent and help the team 

finish with a strong performance.

“From 
a 
more 
logistical 

standpoint, I go last simply because 

I do all the events, so it gives me a 

little more time to rest,” Bock said. 

“But in terms of the mentality, I’ve 

been put in that position many times, 

where if we have a couple falls or 

some adversity in the routines prior, 

I’ll just keep my head down, do my 

routine and try to get a good score 

for the team to bring it back.”

In the meet against the Hawkeyes, 

Bock captured event titles on the 

pommel horse, still rings and parallel 

bars. Bock, alongside Juda, is not only 

training towards the Big Ten and 

NCAA Championships like the rest of 

the Michigan team: he’s also training 

for the USA Championships and the 

Olympic Trials in June. It means 

they often have different practice 

schedules 
from 
their 
teammates, 

but they’re still key leaders for the 

Wolverines.

“(Juda and Bock) are both in the 

same (practice) group … and the 

group coach there, I just let him do it 

however he wants to do it with those 

two guys,” Golder said. “During the 

week, we’ll have scheduled intersquad 

meets on various events, and we don’t 

require those guys to be a part of it. 

So they can just do their own training 

plan for what they need to do.”

Ultimately, although it was a 

grueling few weeks, Bock didn’t 

miss a beat against Iowa, and 

the 
Wolverines 
notched 
solid 

performances with Bock at the 

forefront.

Through Saddi Washington, Michigan bridges past to future

Michigan unable to overcome injury to Brooks

Saddi 
Washington 
rolled 

out of bed and into basketball 

purgatory. 

On the morning of May 13, 

2019, John Beilein, Michigan’s 

all-time 
winningest 
coach, 

accepted 
the 
head-coaching 

position 
with 
the 
NBA’s 

Cleveland Cavaliers. In his wake, 

a stunned program pondered its 

suddenly precarious future. 

Washington, 
an 
assistant 

under Beilein, had no intention of 

leaving Ann Arbor anytime soon. 

Across three years on Beilein’s 

staff, he emerged as an integral 

part 
of 
Michigan’s 
success, 

helping spur the Wolverines 

into college basketball’s upper-

echelon with two consecutive 

30-win seasons. Meanwhile, his 

daughter, Sidney, had settled 

into high school while his son, 

Caleb, transitioned into middle 

school. 

“I always say, the Michigan 

experience has been very kind to 

the Washingtons,” Washington 

told The Daily. 

For 
days, 
Washington 

wondered 
whether 
that 

experience was over. Two weeks 

later, loitering toward the back 

of Juwan Howard’s introductory 

press conference, Washington 

found himself as Michigan’s 

longest-tenured assistant coach. 

Suddenly, he was the senior-

most link to Beilein’s program. 

As the staff’s holdover, his 

priorities shifted. 

He needed to work alongside 

the 
new 
staff 
to 
maintain 

Michigan’s success, an effort 

rooted in conserving the culture. 

A pair of pictures drape the 

back wall to Washington’s office, 

tethers to the past. 

The first, a photo of the 2016-17 

Wolverines celebrating their Big 

Ten Tournament championship. 

The other, a team picture taken 

on the court in San Antonio 

before the 2018 Final Four.

Since those moments, players 

and coaches have come and gone 

within the program. And yet, 

success has endured. 

It’s early February, and when 

Washington leans back in his desk 

chair, both photos come into view, 

blown-up and framed. He didn’t 

know that, a month later, he would 

be standing underneath a drizzle 

of maize confetti in the belly of a 

hollow Crisler Center, exchanging 

hugs and fist-bumps at the outer-

edge of a mosh pit. Michigan, in 

domineering fashion, secured the 

outright Big Ten regular-season 

championship. 

Another photo to add to the 

display. 

The last 11 seasons comprise 

arguably the greatest period of 

sustained success in Michigan 

men’s basketball history. Eight 

(soon to be nine, would have 

been 10) NCAA Tournament 

appearances. 
Five 
Big 
Ten 

championships. Two Final Fours 

and perhaps more forthcoming.

The transition from Beilein 

to Howard elicited no apparent 

drop-off, with the two tenures 

merging into one glorified era. 

Scanning those photos — both 

the pair already framed and the 

one soon to be there — reveals 

Washington to be the constant. 

***

After 
graduating 
from 

Oakland in 2010, Johnathon 

Jones was alone, bound for 

Slovakia on a pro-contract having 

spent the first 23 years of his life 

in Michigan. A few days before 

he left, he received a phone call 

from his former assistant coach, 

Saddi Washington, with some 

advice.

A decade earlier, Washington 

wore Jones’s shoes. He was 

en route to France, having left 

behind his wife and fleeting NBA 

dreams to prolong his playing 

career overseas. 

Challenges awaited — new 

teammates, a new style of play, 

a new culture — with no simple 

remedies. 
Washington 
had 

no one to guide him through 

the transition; bootlegged TV 

programs represented the only 

sort of contact with home. 

And, early on in his tenure as 

an assistant coach at Oakland, 

Washington sought to provide 

his players the mentorship he 

sorely lacked during that time. 

“I just tried to be there every 

step of the way, even though 

I 
wasn’t 
physically 
there,” 

Washington said. “It goes back 

to that day you’re sitting in a 

kid’s living room and they’re 

on campus and you start the 

recruiting pitch and you’re 

talking about family, from my 

perspective that shouldn’t end 

the moment they leave campus.”

Drawing 
upon 
his 
own 

international 
experience 
— 

stints in France, Italy, Israel 

and 
Greece 
— 
Washington 

curated a running Microsoft 

Word 
file 
dubbed 
the 

“European Survival Kit.” It 

encompassed everything from 

packing essentials to advice on 

acclimating to foreign customs, 

to stipulations to watch for in 

contracts. 

“Kinda like when a freshman 

goes to college, you have certain 

things that help you get by,” 

Jones, who played for Oakland 

from 2007-2011, said. “First time 

going overseas, he sat me down, 

made a checklist, told me what I 

could expect.” 

As 
Washington’s 
players 

continued 
to 
embark 
on 

international careers, he would 

“make his rounds,” checking in 

on dozens of players at a time. 

“He’d 
reach 
out, 
‘Young 

fella, man, you got everything 

you need?’ ” Reggie Hamilton, 

who played in seven different 

countries 
after 
his 
Oakland 

career, said. “He really just 

wanted you to be successful from 

the times he had.” 

That’s 
what 
gravitated 

Washington to coaching in the 

first place. As his playing career 

fizzled, coaching emerged as a 

way to give back through future 

generations. “To put them in a 

position … to be successful not 

just in basketball, but in life,” 

Washington says. 

He served one year as a 

volunteer 
assistant 
under 

current-Alabama coach Nate Oats 

at Romulus High School before 

moving on to Oakland University 

in 2006 as an assistant coach. 

There, he quickly embraced his 

different hats — not just that of 

an assistant coach.

“You ask Saddi, ‘Who are you?’ 

and he’s not gonna tell you he’s a 

basketball coach,” Oats said. 

He extended open invitations 

to his house, hosting players to 

watch film, eat dinner or simply 

relax and watch the nightly slate 

of NBA action. In an academic 

setting, he pushed his players to 

take more strenuous classes and 

ensured they completed their 

assignments on time. 

“That’s not his job, man,” Jalen 

Hayes, who played at Oakland 

from 2013-2018, said. “His job 

is to coach us on the court. Just 

going the extra mile, stuff that 

he didn’t have to do, but he did 

anyway because he wanted to 

see us be successful.” 

That mindset is reflected in 

everything Washington does. 

When 
NBA 
speculation 

inundated Kay Felder during 

his junior season, Washington 

initiated a heart-to-heart at the 

baggage carousel before a flight 

home. 

“He didn’t try to steer me and 

say, ‘Oh, you should stay another 

year’ or ‘you should go,’ ” Felder 

said. “It was basically, ‘I’m on 

your side.’ ”

And when Drew Valentine, 

an uncommitted high school 

prospect, 
tore 
his 
ACL 
in 

September of his senior year, 

Washington made sure to be at 

the hospital. When Valentine 

opened his eyes after surgery, he 

saw Washington first. 

“His biggest attribute is he’s 

real,” Carlton Valentine, Drew’s 

father and a close friend of 

Washington’s, said. “You could 

sense his genuine care and 

concern. There’s not a fake bone 

in his body.” 

There’s no perfect science 

to 
a 
coaching 
change. 
On 

multiple levels, it’s a balancing 

act, between players and staff 

members, pre-existing program 

values and the new regime’s 

vision. Each one is different from 

the next. 

Most 
new 
coaches 
at 

high-major 
schools 
inherit 

floundering programs in need 

of a complete makeover. At 

Michigan, that was far from the 

case. Beilein ingrained a culture 

that bred sustained success; 

Howard faced the challenge of 

building off it. 

“Going off, ‘Well, it’s not 

exactly broke here at Michigan, 

let’s keep a staff member on,’ and 

(Juwan) did that,” Beilein said. 

“We also understand that Juwan 

has to put his own stamp on it. 

The whole idea of creating his 

own identity but not letting go of 

the success that we’ve had.”

Retaining 
Washington 

offered a tangible way to do 

that. On Howard’s staff, Phil 

Martelli 
offered 
24 
years 

of 
collegiate 
head-coaching 

experience and Howard Eisley 

brought 
a 
heralded 
NBA 

pedigree. 
Yet 
Washington, 

hired by Beilein in May of 2016, 

possessed a familiarity with 

the players and program that 

others lacked. 

“You gotta have somebody 

that knows these guys,” Oats, 

who was present for coaching 

changes at both Buffalo and 

Alabama, said. “It’s hard to just 

come in, everybody on staff 

building a new relationship 

from scratch. You have to do it 

sometimes, but it’s not easy. It’s 

a lot easier and better to do it 

when you keep somebody.”

Beilein recommended each of 

his staff members to Howard. 

Washington and Howard had 

crossed 
paths 
before, 
both 

on the recruiting trail with 

Howard’s son, Jace, and during 

times when Howard would visit 

the program in past summers. 

They hit it off immediately. 

“Coach Juwan, he’s a people-

person, 
a 
relationship 
guy 

much like myself,” Washington 

said. “So you got two guys that 

really thrive off the energy in a 

relationship.” 

Once on board, Washington’s 

innate 
ability 
to 
develop 

relationships rendered him a 

perfect fit to connect one era 

to the next. He first thought 

to 
address 
the 
needs 
and 

apprehensions of his players. 

He sought to hasten Howard’s 

learning curve, parceling out 

information 
and 
compiling 

cheatsheets on personalities, 

strengths and weaknesses. As 

Howard devised a playbook, 

Washington 
served 
as 
the 

liaison between systems old 

and new. 

“He’s been a star in his role 

as far as doing a great job in 

assisting the staff and myself,” 

Howard said. “He could have 

easily gone to any school, I’m 

sure, and joined someone else’s 

staff as an assistant … because 

of his knowledge for the game 

and understanding of how to 

relate to players. I’m just happy 

that Saddi’s on our side.” 

Washington added: “I really 

just tried to serve as the bridge.” 

Last March, lost in the 

shuffle 
of 
the 
pandemic, 

Western 
Michigan 
relieved 

its longstanding coach, Steve 

Hawkins. The opening seemed 

tailor-made for Washington: a 

two-time All-MAC player, he 

starred as a Bronco from 1994-

1998.

Except, he didn’t want the 

job. He consulted with his 

family and, collectively, they 

agreed the timing wasn’t right. 

“A quality of life decision,” he 

deems it. 

The 
thought 
of 
a 
head 

coaching position, though, has 

crossed 
Washington’s 
mind 

before. 

“I would love to one day have 

the opportunity to be a head 

coach and run a program and 

do a lot of things that I’m doing 

now as an assistant in terms 

of influencing and making an 

impact on young men’s lives,” 

Washington said, a sly grin 

creeping across his face. “But 

just doing it from the first seat.”

It’s a role that anyone who 

has interacted with Washington 

knows he’s prepared for. 

“That dude is a one-of-a-

kind man,” Hamilton said. “I 

can’t wait until he leads his 

own team. I’m really excited to 

see a Saddi Washington-driven 

culture.” 

In reality, though, Hamilton 

doesn’t have to wait to see a 

Washington-inspired culture. 

All he has to do is look at 

Michigan.

The floater went in, but the result 

of the play couldn’t have been worse 

for the Michigan men’s basketball 

team. 

Just 
four-and-a-half 
minutes 

into the Wolverines’ 70-64 loss to 

Michigan State on Sunday, after 

scoring his second basket of the 

game, senior guard Eli Brooks 

injured his left ankle after landing 

awkwardly on the foot of Spartan 

forward Marcus Bingham Jr.

Assisted by Michigan coach 

Juwan Howard and athletic trainer 

Alex Wong, Brooks hobbled to the 

bench and eventually into the locker 

room, emerging in a walking boot at 

the start of the second half. 

“I don’t have much information 

for you about Eli’s injury,” Howard 

said afterward. “(We’ll) get home, 

gonna take a look and see after 

we’ve had our doctors take a look 

at it.”

Added senior wing Isaiah Livers: 

“You know he’s a warrior. … I didn’t 

get to see the replay but had to be 

bad if Eli can’t get back out there.”

As was the case in its first loss 

of the season against Minnesota on 

Jan. 16 — which Brooks missed due 

to injury — the Wolverines looked a 

shell of their typical selves without 

him. 
Michigan’s 
offense 
was 

disjointed, its defense erratic and its 

depth stretched. 

In their loss to the Golden 

Gophers, Michigan shot just 39% 

from the field. This time, it was 

only slightly higher at 41.7%. While 

graduate point guard Mike Smith 

is the team’s primary ball-handler, 

Brooks initiates the offense in his 

relief. Brooks entered the game 

averaging only 2.8 assists, but 

his steady presence has proven 

invaluable for the Wolverines this 

season. 

Brooks, who shoots over 36% 

from deep, also usually gives 

Michigan another scoring threat on 

the perimeter. 

“First we could do better by 

making better decisions,” Howard 

said. 
“Also 
there 
was 
some 

questionable shot selection. I loved 

(their) aggressiveness, but we have 

to be smart-aggressive. And then 

there were times too where we 

were missing guys when they were 

open. We can’t have those moments 

either.” 

Senior guard Chaundee Brown 

stepped in for Brooks. Typically 

the first player off the bench for 

the Wolverines, Brown filled in 

well from a scoring perspective, 

going 5-for-10 from the field 

with 13 points. Unfortunately for 

Michigan, though, its depth behind 

Brown was stretched extremely 

thin. Freshman Zeb Jackson had 

played just five total minutes in the 

last three games but played eight 

against the Spartans.

“No matter what, you can 

never prepare when you lose one 

of your main guys,” Howard said. 

“Chaundee did a good job of stepping 

in, Zeb had some good minutes out 

there as well, but we just pray that 

(Eli) gets back healthy.”

The void left by Brooks was 

especially 
pronounced 
on 
the 

defensive side of the ball. Michigan 

State’s guards Rocket Watts and 

Aaron Henry Jr. combined for 39 

points. Brooks, the Wolverines’ 

best perimeter defender, would’ve 

matched up with one of them. 

Michigan showed signs of life 

late in the game, cutting the deficit 

to two with a minute left. But, the 

Wolverines’ offensive strides were 

ultimately canceled out by their 

inability to get stops down the 

stretch — exactly when you’d want a 

guy like Eli Brooks on the floor. 

“We gotta do a better job of 

defending. 
We 
always 
pride 

ourselves on defense being a staple 

of getting stops, but unfortunately 

today, we didn’t do a good job of 

getting stops when we needed it. I 

loved (their) effort but we gotta do a 

better job of being more locked into 

the details.”

While the severity of Brooks’s 

injury is unknown, the timing 

couldn’t have been worse. Michigan 

plays its first game in the Big Ten 

Tournament this Friday, before 

the NCAA Tournament starts 

the following week. How quickly 

Brooks can return to action may end 

up being the difference between a 

second-round exit and a run to the 

Final Four. 

“When a guy that important 

goes down, you gotta adjust,” 

Livers said. “It’s a next man-up 

mentality, not making no excuses. 

We’re gonna watch film, see 

where we can improve at.”

As Michigan’s learned without 

Brooks, believing in a “next man-

up mentality” and actually living 

up to it are two very different 

things.

Michigan assistant coach Saddi Washington has been the one constant through two coaching regimes.

Wednesday, March 10, 2021 — 15


On March 4, 2021, the final 

seconds ticked off the clock as the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
swarmed together at center court 
following a win over Michigan 
State. With the opening notes of 
Drake’s “Trophies” blaring over 
the PA system, a mass exodus of 
Wolverine players, coaches and 
managers alike ran out from the 
sidelines and began dancing, 
jumping and hugging as they 
celebrated a Big Ten regular 
season title on their home floor.

It was a heady mixture of relief, 

pride and triumph, all exactly 
seven years to the day after their 
last regular season conference 
title. 

The 2013-14 season didn’t 

always look like one destined to 
end in a Big Ten regular season 
title. Following the departures of 
star guards Trey Burke and Tim 
Hardaway Jr. to the NBA Draft, 
Michigan limped into conference 
play with a 6-4 record and 
without a bona fide closer. The 
situation looked even tougher 
when then-sophomore forward 
Mitch 
McGary, 
a 
projected 

lottery pick, suffered a season-
ending back injury.

“It was one of those things 

where we looked at each other 
and we were like, ‘Look, he’s 
not coming back anytime soon. 
There’s no one coming in to save 
the day for us. This is all we have,’ 
” then-sophomore guard Nik 
Stauskas told the Daily. “I think it 
was that kind of realization where 
we said, ‘We’ve gotta do our part 
in stepping up and helping this 
team win if we wanna turn this 
season around.’ ”

But in the furnace of conference 

play, the Wolverines started to 
forge an identity. After picking up 
four games against middling foes, 
Michigan had to run its toughest 
gauntlet of the year: playing top-
10 opponents Wisconsin, Iowa 
and Michigan State all in the same 
week. Similarly to this season, 
there was no margin for error 
against any Big Ten opponent.

“That’s what you get with Big 

Ten basketball,” then-sophomore 
guard Spike Albrecht told the 
Daily. “There’s no nights off no 
matter who you’re playing. Every 
time you go on the road, you know 
it’s gonna be a challenge.”

Added Stauskas: “We knew 

coming into Big Ten season, ‘This 

is who we have, and we have to 
turn it around.’ ”

Coming into a road game 

against Wisconsin in Madison on 
Jan. 18 that year, the Wolverines 
were heavy underdogs against 
the top-ranked team in the Big 
Ten. With the game on the line, 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
tried to draw a play up with his 
team clinging to a one-point 
edge with a minute left. After 
passing up an open shot prior 
to the timeout, Beilein told 
Stauskas he didn’t think he was 
ready to be the team’s go-to man 
in the clutch. The Wolverines’ 
search for a closer would remain 
open.

Stasukas wasn’t having it.
“I think he knew saying 

that would kinda light the fire 
underneath me, that made me 
furious,” Stauskas said. “I was 
like ‘No, coach. I got this. Run 
it back.’ So we came back out on 
the floor and ran the same play, 
and that’s the play where I hit 
that stepback. And that’s why 
when I was walking back to the 
bench, the camera zooms in on 
me and you can see me saying, 
‘I want this,’ and it was just me 
telling him, ‘I’m not scared of the 
moment.’ ”

Carrying 
the 
momentum 

from the win over the Badgers, 
Michigan went on a tear. With 
wins over the Hawkeyes and 
Spartans, 
the 
Wolverines 

launched into the top 10 of that 
week’s AP Poll. With an official 
closer and a newfound level 
of confidence, the Wolverines 
became the team to beat in the 
Big Ten.

“As a team, we just had this 

confidence about us like, ‘No one 
in the Big Ten can mess with us,’ ” 
Stauskas said.

While 
Stauskas 
was 

Michigan’s unquestioned star, the 
Wolverines were aided in large 
part by the play of two freshmen, 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. and 
forward Zak Irvin. The two were 
irreplaceable parts of the 2014 
squad who played with veteran 
poise and made a plethora of 
clutch shots and big plays in their 
debut campaigns.

“Both of them, they weren’t 

scared of the moment,” Stauskas 
said. “They always wanted more.”

On March 4, Michigan traveled 

to Champaign. While Illinois was 
a middling team in that year’s Big 
Ten, the Wolverines refused to 
look past them. This wasn’t just 
another conference game: this 
was a chance to clinch a Big Ten 
regular season title.

“I think we knew with the 

way we were playing that year 
we were going to win that game, 
but (Beilein) didn’t want us to 

take them lightly,” Stauskas 
said. “And the amount of focus 
and concentration that coach 
Beilein had, he was not gonna 
let us lose.”

Sure enough, the Wolverines 

blazed their way to a dominant 
win, clinching the Big Ten 
regular 
season 
title 
with 

an 84-53 victory. While the 
celebration was sweet, it was 
even sweeter when the team 
celebrated its title at Crisler 
Center following a win over 
Indiana later that week.

“That 
moment 
of 

accomplishment on your own 
court, to be the sole champion,” 
Beilein 
said. 
“Just 
think 

about how many times that’s 
happened. That hasn’t happened 
a lot. We won two of them and 
one of them was a three-way 
tie.”

And seven years later, the 

Wolverines added another Big 
Ten regular season title banner 
to the Crisler Center rafters 
as Beilein watched from the 
stands. 

“It does mean a lot to win the 

regular season championship, 
because it means you withstood 
the 
test 
of 
time,” 
Beilein 

said. 
“Only 
the 
National 

Championship is a better gauge 
for how good you are.”

While this year’s Michigan 

team has not finished writing 
its narrative, the 2014 team 
can see pieces of themselves in 

what they have accomplished 
to this point. Besides following 
suit 
by 
winning 
a 
regular 

season championship, the way 
the Wolverines of today play 
together reminds its former 
players of their own days on the 
court.

“The biggest parallel is that 

they look like they genuinely love 
playing together and playing for 
one another,” Albrecht said. “I 
think that’s part of the reason 
we were so successful. We were a 
really close-knit group, all really 
good friends, had fun going out 
on the court. 

“Nobody 
cared 
who 
was 

scoring, making all the plays. 
At the end of the day we just 
wanted to win. And I think that’s 
something that this group does 
as well.”

This fall, Michigan will raise 

another Big Ten regular season 
banner to stand beside 2014’s. 
Whenever Stauskas returns to 
Ann Arbor, he reminds himself 
that the banner bearing his squad’s 
name is a sign that they left their 
mark. Now that this year’s squad 
has accomplished the same feat, 
he hopes it feels it, too.

“You’re a part of history,” 

Stauskas said. “You’ve left your 
mark on the school, and it’s a 
good feeling knowing whatever 
new players are stepping into 
that arena and are a part of that 
program, they’re gonna look up 
and see that part of history.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

ANNIE KLUSENDORF/Daily 

Michigan won its regular season championship on the same day that the 2014 squad won its championship.

The best coach in school history 

had just left only a year after signing 
an 
extension. 
Warde 
Manuel 

started his coaching search with an 
idea of where to go.

He’d been the sport administrator 

for Michigan hockey for some time 
in the early aughts, getting to know 
now-Michigan 
coach 
Mel 

Pearson 
well. 

Manuel knew, 
of course, that 
Red Berenson 
would 
be 

leaving 
after 

the 
2016-17 

season. 
He 

approached 
the 
interview 

process with a 
crisp professionalism, Pearson says 
— one interview, no conversations 
before or after until the job was 
offered. 
All 
things 
equal, 
he 

preferred someone with a Michigan 
connection, Berenson said. It wasn’t 
long before Pearson received an 
offer.

“I thought they were really 

thorough on the process, what 
they needed to know and who they 
talked to,” Pearson said.

The hire of Pearson was Manuel’s 

first high-profile personnel move 
as athletic director, and it paid 
immediate dividends. Pearson led 
Michigan to a Frozen Four in his 
first year coaching the program 
and has the Wolverines on pace for 
an NCAA Tournament berth this 
year after netting an NHL prospect-
laden recruiting class.

Meanwhile, on Sunday in East 

Lansing, Juwan Howard — Manuel’s 
hire as men’s basketball coach — 
wrapped up a regular season that 
culminated in a Big Ten title and 
will likely yield a No. 1 seed in the 
NCAA Tournament. Howard, in 
just his second year as a head coach, 
has made Manuel look like a savant. 
Between him and Kevin Ollie, who 
led UConn to a national title the 

year after Manuel hired him there 
before NCAA sanctions crippled the 
program, the man seems to have a 
way of finding basketball coaches.

To find out why, let’s start with 

a common description of Manuel. 
He’s direct and honest, the kind 
of boss who can be firm while 
letting you feel you were heard. 
The best way to say it comes from 
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun:

“He’s not a bullshitter,” Calhoun 

said.

He tells a story to demonstrate. 

After Calhoun retired, Ollie was 
widely considered an easy pick to 
replace him. Initially, he didn’t want 
to do it.

“Warde said, ‘Tell him he’s got 

two hours,’ ” Calhoun recalled. 
“Within two hours, under my 
advice, he took the job.”

Manuel didn’t have time for 

bullshit then, and he didn’t have 
time for it in May 2019. He read 
the stories during an unusually 
long wait between Michigan hiring 
Howard and the school introducing 
him at a press conference. They 
described the hiring as a risk and 
a gamble, given Howard’s lack of 
head coaching experience. 

When a reporter asked Manuel 

about that perception, he spoke 
for over five minutes straight, 
voice rising with inflection as 
he went. Softball coach Carol 
Hutchins started out as a part-time 
administrative assistant, he said, 
football coach Jim Harbaugh as a 
part-time assistant under his father 
in the offseason. He issued a plea — 
let Howard evolve.

“In the last two years, folks, 110 

schools have changed basketball 
coaches. A lot of those people 
who change have great deals of 
experience,” he said, throwing his 
arms out. “Let him evolve, let him 
develop into a head coach of his 
own. That’s what I’m gonna do. 
Support him, answer questions, 
put people around him and let him 
evolve. 

“All these things about, ‘He hasn’t 

coached a game’ and ‘What’s Warde 
doing, oh my god he’s taking a risk 
and a gamble’ and all these different 
things — I’m gonna gamble with 
people who love this place the way 
he does. That gets emotional when 
he looks at his family and he talks to 
those kids. I’m gonna take that risk, 
I’m gonna take that challenge. Put it 
on me.”

Manuel, through a spokesman, 

declined an interview request for 
this story. Suffice it to say, though, 
he should be happy to have the hire 
put on him.

It’s important to note that 

Manuel’s performance as athletic 
director has not been perfect. In 
early 2019, he green-lit the hire 
of Rhonda Faehn, a former USA 
Gymnastics 
official 
who 
had 

allegedly waited a week after being 
told of Larry Nassar’s abuse of 
athletes before reporting it to the 
FBI. Manuel admitted in a public 
statement that doing so was “the 
wrong 
decision,” 
firing 
Faehn 

just days after her initial hire and 
apologizing after a Michigan Daily 
story on Faehn sparked outrage. 
More recently, Manuel also failed 
to follow University policy with 
regard to the Robert Anderson 
investigation, forwarding a letter 
alleging sexual assault by former 
team doctor Robert Anderson to 
University lawyers instead of Title 
IX investigators.

Manuel’s 
performance 
as 

athletic director, in sum, includes 
all of those issues every bit as much 
as it includes who he’s hired. When 
all is said and done, the Anderson 
scandal could eclipse any good he 
or other University administrators 
have done.

Manuel, though, has telegraphed 

a desire for stability above all else 
through who he’s hired. He wants 
coaches he can trust and coaches 
who will stick with the program. 
It helps of course that there’s been 
no need to start firing anybody, 
but keeping everyone on board is 
an achievement of its own. Manuel 

wants to stay out of the public eye — 
since hiring Howard, he’s done just 
two formal press conferences — but 
among his most revealing public 
comments came in May 2018, when 
he said he wanted Harbaugh and 
John Beilein to retire at Michigan.

Soon after, it was reported 

that Beilein — in the midst of 
negotiating a contract extension 
— had interviewed for an NBA job 
with the Detroit Pistons. Beilein 
told Manuel he could take back 
the contract he offered, as he’d 
extended it without knowing there 
was discussion between Beilein 
and the Pistons. Manuel told him 
no. Beilein eventually returned 
to Michigan another year before 
leaving for the Cleveland Cavaliers 
the next summer.

“When 
(Manuel) 
likes 
the 

direction of your program,” Beilein 
said, “he’s gonna stick with you 
through thick and thin.”

Manuel’s persona fits the politics 

of Michigan well, his background 
as a football player in Ann Arbor 
tends to come up. More important 
to his success, though, is that in an 
environment where the University’s 
administration wants its high-
profile athletics program to be 
anything but a headache, he is, for 
the most part, able to keep things 
above board.

That is what makes his decisions 

surrounding Harbaugh and the 
football program so compelling. 
After a Murphy’s Law-inspired, 
2-4 pandemic season, Manuel 
extended Harbaugh, but did so 
on a University-friendly contract 
with a low buyout. “Following the 
completion of the season, we talked 
for many hours on what it will take 
for Jim to lead and get us back on 
the right trajectory,” Manuel said 
in a statement announcing the 
extension.

That unto itself represents a 

departure from the hands-off style 
Manuel usually employs. During 
one stretch early in his tenure, two 

basketball assistants both left the 
program, leading Beilein to meet 
with Manuel a handful of times to 
get new hires sorted. 

“I think that in the future, 

you’ll find out I won’t be in your 
office unless you want me here, 
but a couple times a year,” Beilein 
recalled telling him. 

This 
to 
say 
— 
big-picture 

conversations about the trajectory 
of the program aren’t the sort of 
thing Manuel’s having regularly 
with all his coaches.

Given the circumstance wrought 

by the pandemic, both financial 
and on the football field, where 
opt-outs and injuries helped the 
team’s misfortune spiral, Manuel 
took the easiest option in front of 
him. If things don’t work out with 
Harbaugh, he can move on at a 
low cost at a point where it’s more 
financially prudent to do so. If 
Michigan gets back to winning nine 
games next year, he can go back to 
ignoring the portion of the fan base 
that calls for a coaching change 
after every loss.

Ironically, 
it’s 
a 
third-way 

move — the opposite of a gamble. 
Different circumstances dictate a 
different approach, though Manuel 
might still dispute the notion that 
Howard was a gamble to begin 
with. Howard, who earlier this 
season aimed a diatribe at the 
doubters who questioned his hire, 
might as well.

“He will, in my opinion, evolve 

into a great coach, a great head 
coach,” Manuel said in 2019, “cause 
he’s already a great man as you all 
saw.”

On Thursday, when Michigan 

clinched the Big Ten title, Howard 
found Manuel in the stands and 
pointed 
amid 
the 
celebration. 

Socially distanced, they shared a 
moment before Howard returned to 
his team.
