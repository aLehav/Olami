City ranks 6th in state 
in Michigan attorney 

general survey

By EMMA KERR and 

RIYAH BASHA

Managing News Editor, 

Daily Staff Reporter

The Ann Arbor Police Depart-

ment ranks 6th highest out of 
548 
Michigan 
police 
depart-

ments in number of untested rape 
kits, according to survey results 
released Thursday by Michigan 
Attorney General Bill Schuette.

The attorney general’s survey 

found 1,189 untested kits in total, 
not including police departments 
in Wayne County. The survey was 
prompted by a 2009 study that 
found 11,000 untested rape kits in 
Wayne County, which is why the 
county was excluded in the survey.

According to the survey, AAPD 

currently has 65 untested rape 

kits.

Overall, the number of untested 

rape kits in Washtenaw County 
ranked 6th-highest out of the 83 
counties in Michigan.

The vast majority of counties 

included in the survey data had 
zero or nearly zero untested rape 
kits. 14 had 30 or more untested 
rape kits. Of those counties with 
30 or more untested rape kits, 50 
percent are home to a university or 
college.

The University of Michigan 

Police Department reported 0 
untested rape kits. UMPD’s juris-
diction includes sexual assaults 
that occur on University property 
or at a university function.

Other universities, however, 

reported significant numbers. Of 
the 11 university police depart-
ments 
in 
Michigan,

At Michigan 

League, faculty 
and students talk 
diversity efforts

By ANDREW HIYAMA

For the Daily

LSA Dean Andrew Martin 

hosted about 20 students and 
faculty in the Hussey Room of 
the Michigan League Thurs-
day to discuss the University’s 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Plan.

The event, #withDeanMar-

tin, was one of a series of ongo-
ing town hall-style forums 
held by Martin with the aim of 
facilitating communication and 
openness between the students 
and administration.

In the first of three planned 

guided forums on diversity, the 
discussion began with high-
lighting the role of admissions 
in diversifying the University. 

Martin said while the admis-
sions process is fundamental, 
recruitment is perhaps more 
important in creating a diverse 
environment.

“The way in which we recruit 

students, and the way in which 
we orient students, and the way 
in which we sort of welcome 
students to join our community 
defines the climate for what 
we end up having on campus,” 
Martin said.

The explicit use of race and 

other demographic factors in 
admissions for public colleges in 
Michigan was banned in 2006 
by a statewide ballot proposal.

Martin noted the importance 

of reaching out to communities 
from which — due to differences 
of socioeconomic status — the 
University doesn’t receive many 
applicants.

Angela 
Dillard, 
associate 

dean of undergraduate educa-
tion, also addressed facilitating 
more inclusivity in study abroad

“Branch,” 

developed by two 
seniors, links like-
minded individuals

By KATHERINE CURRAN

For the Daily

Almost two years ago, LSA 

senior Ryan Wolande and 
Engineering senior Kevin Lee 
felt frustrated with connec-
tions present-day social media 
provided — sparking a desire 
to create an app that made 
connecting online a more per-
sonal and interactive experi-
ence.

For Wolande and Lee, that 

desire turned into developing 
Branch, a social app that aims 
to harnesses people’s desire to 
connect with others in a more 
personal way. After users of 
the app post anonymously 
to a “Spot” on campus, such 
as the Shapiro Undergradu-
ate Library or the Michigan 
Union, anyone can respond to 
their post and start a conver-
sation. If the users convers-
ing feel comfortable, they can 
later send each other a “profile 
share request” to reveal their 
identities and meet up in the 
real world.

“People are glued to their 

phones,” 
Wolande 
said. 

“Social media today is not a 
social experience, it’s an expe-
rience with a phone.”

Wolande said Branch, now 

available on iOS and coming to 
Android mid-February, allows 

users to connect one-on-one 
and post exact locations. He 
added that Branch is different 
than apps like Tinder, which 
people also use to meet each 
other in person, because it 
focuses more on real connec-
tions rather than appearance.

“It’s the only one that allows 

you to start as anonymous so 
you can express yourself fully 
without being concerned of 
being judged, while it still has 
the potential of meeting peo-
ple in the real world,” Wolan-
de said.

Currently, Branch has about 

100 active users and a total of 
300 to 400 downloads. How-
ever, Wolande said he and Lee 
hope the usage of the app will 
increase exponentially once 
they start marketing Branch 
in mid-to-late February.

He noted that the Branch 

team has secured a $20,000 
investment from an unex-
pected angel investor and plan 
to use the money to promote 
the app by hosting events at 
bars and handing out free 
merchandise, 
like 
T-shirts, 

koozies and lighters.

“We hope to have 5,000 

to 10,000 users by the end of 
the semester and then hope-
fully 
achieve 
campus-wide 

use after the beginning of next 
semester,” Wolande said.

If Branch becomes more 

popular campuswide, Wolan-
de said he thinks it will be a 
useful social tool for incom-
ing freshmen in particular by 
making the University seem 
less overwhelming.

Panel aims to 

promotes awareness, 
responsibility about 

equity

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

As part of the University’s 

ongoing initiative to build cam-
pus diversity and inclusion, Uni-
versity President Mark Schlissel 
hosted a public panel discussion 
with various leaders in higher 
education Thursday. The talk, 
titled “Facing the Challenge: 
the continued commitment to 
diversity in higher education,” 
took place at the Rackham 
Graduate School.

The 
University’s 
National 

Center for Institutional Diver-
sity partnered with the Ameri-
can Council on Education to 
bring together higher educa-

tion leaders and leading faculty 
members the University. For 
the event, representatives from 
Rutgers University, the Univer-
sity of Maryland, the University 
of New Mexico and Education-
Counsel, an education consult-
ing firm, were present at the 
discussion.

Schlissel kicked off the con-

versation with comments on 
the role of public institutions in 
today’s society and the respon-
sibility they have to encourage 
diversity.

“Ensuring the diversity of its 

academic community is perhaps 
the biggest challenge facing 
institutes of higher education,” 
Schlissel said. “Racial strife has 
exposed wounds and inspired 
students to protest. All must feel 
welcome. Those of us at public 
institutions have a special role 
to serve all of humanity. Race 
and ethnicity are undoubtedly 
key factors in expanding our 
reach.”

Robert Sellers, vice provost 

for Equity, Inclusion, and Aca-
demic Affairs, said he thought 
the panel brought in leaders to 
address the changes happening 
in our world in regard to diver-
sity.

“This special panel is part of a 

larger ongoing two-day confer-
ence … The panel today is par-
ticularly timely given a lot of the 
activism going on in our cam-
pus today,” Sellers said. “Most 
importantly, the panel today is 
timely because of what is going 
on in our society. If higher edu-
cation is going to meet the needs 
of this more diverse society, we 
need to open access to com-
munities that have never had 
access before.”

The night’s discussion also 

came at a significant time judi-
cially, as a landmark case is 
being heard this term by the 
U.S. Supreme Court against the 
University of Texas-Austin for 

Officials seek 
to limit effects 
of second-hand 

smoke

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Starting Monday, a smok-

ing 
restriction 
for 
Ann 

Arbor city parks will expand 
from prohibiting smoking 
in 77 parks to including 79 
additional parks, the city 
announced last Friday.

The ordinance now applies 

to a total of 156 out of 159 city 
parks. The smoking prohibi-
tion not only applies to smok-
ing traditional cigarettes, but 
also to cigars and pipes and 
e-cigarettes.

In April 2014, the Ann 

Arbor City Council approved 
the outdoor smoking ban 
that allowed the city admin-
istrator to select certain 
parks to become smoke-free. 
Following collaboration with 
the city’s Park Advisory 
Commission, the ban went 
into effect February 2015, 
but only affected 77 parks in 
the city.

The 
only 
recreational 

areas that will be exempt are 
Cobblestone Farm, Huron 
Hills Golf Course and Leslie 
Park Golf Course.

Josh Landefeld, deputy 

manager of Parks and Rec-
reation, said there never was 
a huge issue with smoking in 
parks prior to the ordinance. 
However, he said having a

Focusing on athletes and 

members of the military, the 
University of Michigan Center 
for Integrative Research in 
Critical Care has partnered 
with the Combat Casualty 
Care 
Research 
Program 

under the U.S. Department of 
Defense to research traumatic 
brain injury treatment.

Dr. Kevin Ward, director 

of the MCIRCC and Fast 
Forward Medical Innovation, 
said the collaboration was key 
to the research initiative.

“You have the great minds 

and 
integrated 
science 

teams at Michigan through 
MCIRCC, which is focused 
on critical illness and injury,” 
Ward said. “You’ve got the 
Department of Defense which 
also has a lot of resources and 
experience to bring. And then 
you have this family from the 
Detroit area that has made 
this magnificent gift. When 
you combine all these things, I 

think that more is possible. It 
is all about integration.”

For 
student 
athletes 
at 

the University brain injury 
research 
is 
particularly 

relevent, as many of them have 
experienced 
such 
injuries 

during their time as athletes.

Ani 
Sarkisian, 
forward 

for the University’s women’s 
soccer team, has had three 
concussions. She said brain 
injuries have a big impact on 
athletes.

“I think any sport would 

appreciate research on (severe 
traumatic 
brain 
injuries) 

done,” Sarkisian said. “We 
would 
really 
appreciate 

having any more prevention or 
precautionary things done to 
prevent concussions because 
right now it’s the only thing 
that really takes athletes out 
of their sport. You can bring 
them back from a hurt arm 
or a torn ACL, but when it’s 
about your brain it is a totally 
different issue.”

The research is supported 

by a 2015 donation to the 
University from the Joyce 
and 
Don 
Massey 
Family 

Foundation 
donated 
to 

the University in 2015 to 
fund research surrounding 
technological 
innovation, 

patient/family 
support, 

clinical treatment and therapy 

to those suffering from a 
traumatic brain injury, or TBI. 
The Foundation was set up to 
honor a family member who 
suffered from a TBI.

Department 
of 
Defense 

service members and families 
suffer from the most traumatic 
brain injuries in the United 
States, making brain injury 
research a particular area of 
interest for them as well. The 
Department of Defense has 
a unique level of experience 
and resources to bring to 
this 
initiative, 
including 

field medics who will act as 
mentors, according to a press 
release.

Dr. 
Ward 
said 
military 

personnel’s constant exposure 
to TBIs has the potential to 
further enhance research in 
the area.

“Over 
these 
years, 

traumatic brain injuries have 
been a huge problem for the 
military, where it has sort of 
become the signature injury,” 
Ward said. “We have not, 
holistically around the world 
and medicine and science, 
been able to move the dial. 
There are very few benefits 
to war, but one of those things 
is 
learning 
about 
trauma 

medicine.”

At their meeting on Monday, 

City Council members are slated 
to discuss relations with the Uni-
versity, Take Back the Night and 
TEDxUofM.

Resolution to Approve River-

side Park Parking Lot and Lease 
with the University of Michigan

The Ann Arbor City Council 

will consider a resolution that 
would allow the University to use 
city-owned land as a parking lot.

If the resolution is approved, 

the University will acquire the 
right to use 18 parking spaces 
located off Canal Street in Ann 
Arbor.

Eight votes are required for the 

approval of this resolution.

The University would be per-

mitted to use the land for a dura-
tion of two years, from March 1, 
2016 through Feb. 28, 2018 with 
the option of renewing the lease 
when it ends. During this time, 
the University would pay the 
city a yearly rental fee of $12,177 
which is $676.50 per parking spot.

Each party would be respon-

sible for its own liabilities and 
insurance as related to the prop-
erty in question. No third party 
would be permitted to use or ben-
efit from the land.

City Council has passed resolu-

tions in the past renting parking 
lot spaces to the University. In 
2014, the city passed a resolution 
allowing the University to rent 
parking lots off Fuller Road in 
Ann Arbor for a duration of two 
years with an option to renew at 
the end of this period.

Resolution to Approve Street 

Closings for the 2016 Take Back 
the Night Rally and March

A resolution for permission to 

close city streets on April 6, 2016 
for the 38th annual Take Back the 
Night event.

Take Back the Night is a protest 

against sexual assault that aims 
to allows survivors and support-
ers to speak out against sexual 
violence and rape culture.

Each year, this event sees 

participation 
from 
University 

students and faculty as well as 
members of the Ann Arbor com-
munity.

If approved, the resolution 

will allow portions of South State 
Street, East Liberty Street, South 
Fourth Street, West William 
Street, Thompson Street and East 
Madison Street to be closed dur-
ing the event.

Resolution to Approve Street 

Closings 
for 
the

Event

A second street closing reso-

lution will be presented, asking 
for approval to shut down Wash-
ington Street between Thayer 
and Fletcher streets from 6 p.m. 
on March 31 to 6 p.m. on April 1, 
2016.

The shutdown is for the 7th 

annual TEDxUofM conference. 
Last year’s conference drew a 
crowd of 1,700 people

The theme for this year’s 

conference has not yet been 
announced. In past years, themes 
have 
included 
“Constructive 

Interference,” 
“Against 
the 

Grain” and “Inform/Transform.”

using race in their admissions, 
Fisher v. University of Texas. 
The Fisher case echoes a suit 
that was brought against the 
University over its use of race 
in admissions to the Supreme 
Court in 2003, Gratz v. Bol-
linger. Though the court uti-
mately ruled that parts of the 
University’s affirmative action 
were legal, in a subsequent 
2006 ballot proposal banned 
the use of race, gender and 

other demographic elements in 
public college admissions in the 
state.

During the panel, Kedra 

Ishop, associate vice president 
for enrollment management at 
the University, said she under-
stands the precarious situa-
tion of admissions and the role 
race plays in it. Ishop told the 
panel that for every applicant 
to the University, the admis-
sions office must consider what 
lead the prospective student 
to apply and who they are as 
students in order to identify 
possible advantages and dis-
advantages in the admissions 

process.

“How do we know, think 

about and communicate with 
our student body about who we 
are; and with the way we rep-
resent test scores; and how we 
represent our student body?” 
Ishop said. “Certain popula-
tions don’t apply to us because 
they think they can’t get in. 
Low-income 
students 
don’t 

apply as much and we have to 
change how we represent our-
selves to them.”

Overall, the panel agreed 

that it is time to finish what 
was started during the Civil 
Rights Movement.

Nancy 
Cantor, 
chancellor 

of Rutgers University, said all 
universities should strive for 
inclusion to give all students a 
pathway to opportunity.

“We need to think of our 

place in the world. It’s about 
what is happening and what has 
happened,” Cantor said. “We 
are in a paradoxical moment 
where we are dramatically 
changing. How are we going to 
be the engines of opportunity 
that universities supposedly 
have always been?”

State research 
economic benefits 
top $17 billion

The state of Michigan’s 

University Research Corridor 
contributed $17.5 billion to the 
Michigan economy in 2015, 
according to a University 
press release this week. The 
URC is a collective of research 
by the University, Michigan 
State and Wayne State, and 
boosted economic activity in 
every region in the state due to 
student spending, spending on 
operations and alumni earnings. 
The URC’s overall earnings 
are up this year from 2014, as 
is the number of patents issued 
and transfers of research and 
development. For every dollar 
invested in URC universities, 
the press release announced, 
the state receives $22 back in 
benefits. 

State workers in 
Flint were warned 
about water

The Detroit Free Press reported 
Thursday evening that state 
workers in Flint arranged for 
coolers of filtered water in their 
offices in January, even as they 
announced to the public that 
the city’s water was safe to 
drink. 

“While the City of Flint 

states that corrective actions 
are not necessary, DTMB is 
in the process of providing a 
water cooler on each occupied 
floor, positioned near the 
water fountain, so you can 
choose which water to drink,” 
read a notice from the state 
Department of Technology, 
Management and Budget. 

Spokespeople from the 

DTMB responded that its 
office provided water coolers 
due to health notices posted 
in December that the city had 
claimed already subsided, 
and never deemed the water 
unsafe, but instead provided 
alternatives for its employees. 
Detroit teachers 
sue city public 
schools

The Detroit Federation of 

Teachers filed a lawsuit against 
Detroit Public Schools Thursday 
morning and demanded the 
city’s emergency manager step 
down due to the condition of 
school buildings. 

The lawsuit, on behalf of the 

union and its national and state 
affiliates, argues that the run-
down buildings cause students 
“to spend their young lives in 
deplorable surroundings,” and 
suffer irreperable damage to 
their health as a result. 

The union also called for 

improvements to building 
codes and a cohesive plan for 
remodeling school buildings.

Andrea Bitely, the attorney 

general’s director of communi-
cations, said city size could play 
a role in the varying numbers of 
untested kits among different 
departments.

“Larger population centers are 

most likely to have more sexual 
assault kits in general,” she said. 
“That’s why you see bubbles in 
certain places and it’s more asso-
ciated with population than it 
being a college town.”

State officials now plan to use 

the survey data to coordinate 
local efforts to process the kits 
with help from state police. Bite-
ly noted that some kits may have 
been left untested intentionally.

“Some of them were associat-

ed with crimes where the suspect 
confessed or pled guilty or the 
police knew what happened and 
they were able to secure a convic-
tion or a plea in another way,” she 
said. “Just because this kit was 
not tested does not mean justice 
wasn’t served.” 

Diane 
Brown, 
University 

Police spokesperson, said she 
could not comment on the 
descrepancy between reported 
AAPD and UMPD untested rape 
kit numbers. AAPD Detective 
Lieutenant Robert Pfannes did

smoking ban in place helped 
the city become a smoke-free 
environment.

“Part of the goal of the parks 

is to provide places of health 
and wellness for the citizens of 
Ann Arbor, and with the trend 
of non-smoking areas, espe-
cially in public due to second-
hand smoke, we just feel that 
parks are an obvious place to be 
smoke-free,” Landefeld said.

Since the ordinance went 

into effect, Landefeld said there 
have been no tickets issued and 
no negative feedback from resi-
dents.

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski 
(D–Ward 
5), 

who introduced the original 
legislation allowing the city 
administrator to declare parks 
smoke-free zones, said his 
interest in the topic stems from 
having three young children.

“Our parks and playgrounds 

should be places of health, not 
places where kids are going 
to be exposed to second-hand 
smoke or picking up cigarette 
butts and putting them in their 
mouth,” Warpehoski said.

Warpehoski said after his 

legislation was passed, the 
decision 
on 
implementation 

was handed over to the Parks 
Advisory 
Commission, 
who 

made the first recommenda-
tion as to what parks were 
going to be the first to hold the 
ordinance. The initial 77 parks 
placed priority on playgrounds 
and downtown parks.

“I think that we’re moving in 

the right direction,” Warpehos-
ki said. “We’re setting up poli-
cies to make sure that more and 
more of our parks are places for 
health and not places for haz-
ardous second-hand smoke.”

Councilmember Sabra Briere 

(D–Ward 1), said council heard 
many complaints about people 
smoking in public areas prior to 
the bans being set in place.

“The city had no regulation 

to enforce any kind of control 
because there was no ordi-
nance,” Briere said. “People 
who found themselves at play 
areas with adults who were 
smoking, or in front of City 
Hall where everybody was 
smoking right outside the door, 
there was no legal recourse. 
They could request all they 
wanted that the smokers move 
aside, but the smokers some-
times didn’t feel very much like 
doing that.”

Briere said the city placed 

the ban on only about half the 
parks initially to find out how it 
might impact residents.

Echoing Landefeld, Briere 

also said she has not received 
many grievances from Ann 
Arbor citizens regarding the 
ban. Most of the attention the 
issue received has come from 
the media, she added.

“The 
biggest 
concern 

I’ve heard anybody mention 
includes e-cigarettes,” Briere 
said. “People who believe they 
are being healthy by smoking 
e-cigarettes instead of tobacco 

with fire are resentful that 
this applies to e-cigarettes. I 
don’t exactly understand that 
because, in my view, this is 
about smoking in parks, it’s not 
(just) about smoking.”

Briere 
added 
that 
she 

believes e-cigarettes contain 
other chemicals that could be 
just as, if not more, harmful as 
the chemicals in regular ciga-
rettes despite some arguing 
they are a healthier alternative 
for limiting secondhand smoke. 
The New York Times reported 
that research is inconclusive on 
the topic, 

“Someone who is smoking in 

a nature area may find this an 
extraordinarily 
inconvenient 

solution for their rights, and I 
can appreciate that, but at the 
same time, I find myself think-
ing, (I’m) not going to embrace 
the idea that you have the right 
to smoke next to me,” Briere 
said.

Councilmember Julie Grand 

(D–Ward 1) said she was not on 
council when the decision was 
originally made, but because 
the ordinance is very similar to 
those in other cities, she does 
not believe the city is overstep-
ping their bounds in enforcing 
this policy.

“We just wanted to make 

sure that our parks were avail-
able to all residents, including 
those that are non-smokers, 
and that smoking wasn’t an 
appropriate activity in our city 
parks,” Grand said.

Much like Briere, Grand said 

she has not received any com-
plaints regarding the ban.

“Initially there were con-

cerns 
about 
enforcement,” 

Grand said. “It was put in place 
mainly so that if you don’t want 
to see smoking in the parks, 
that you as a resident have the 
ability to point to the sign and 
to the policy and to be able to 
ask a smoker politely to stop, 
and to have that policy behind 
you when you make that 
request.”

The locations still exempt 

from the ban, Grand said, still 
allow smoking since people 
often smoke cigars while golf-
ing.

As well, one of the locations 

Cobblestone Farm is frequently 
reserved by the public for wed-
dings and other events, and the 
venue prohibits smoking inside 
the building.

Overall, Grand said she is 

pleased that the policy has 
been expanded. She said she 
believes the ban can encourage 
residents to ask someone not 
to smoke and help maintain a 
clean environment.

“It’s all self-enforcement,” 

Grand said. “There is a provi-
sion in the ban that one could 
potentially alert public safety 
of non-compliance, but the 
intent of the ban was really 
self-enforcement that you, as a 
resident, could hopefully feel 
comfortable politely reminding 
someone of the policy, and that 
that hopefully will be enough 
to make sure that someone isn’t 
smoking around you or your 
family members.”

programs.

“If we got every program to 

step back and ask itself ques-
tions about differential impacts, 
the effects of that would just be 
amazing,” Dillard said.

Another 
prevalent 
subject 

was how faculty and gradu-
ate student instructors can be 
included in the initiative. Many 
students voiced support at the 
discussion for faculty and GSIs 
to be trained to encourage stu-
dent engagement with diversity 
initiatives in their departments.

Dillard 
acknowledged 

that there is room to improve 
instructors’ sensitivity to issues 
of minority students, while add-
ing that GSIs are often inad-
equately prepared to recognize 
and listen to concerns about the 
different ways in which students 
learn.

Discussing some of the diver-

sity mandates that LSA current-
ly implements, Martin asked the 
audience about their views on 
the goals of the college’s race 

and ethnicity course require-
ments. Currently, LSA is review-
ing the requirements as part of 
their planning process for the 
University’s 
diversity, 
equity 

and inclusion initiative. At their 
meeting Tuesday, Central Stu-
dent Government also discussed 
several 
resolutionsaimed 
at 

strengthening the requirements.

Many students at the forum 

said they thought R&E cours-
es were lacking meaningful 
engagement 
and 
integration 

outside of the classroom. Cit-
ing other mandated programs 
like Change it Up! — a program 
that aims to increase bystander 
intervention education — as 
well, one student suggested a 
long-term program would be 
more effective.

In response, Dillard pointed 

out the difficulties in expanding 
the program so drastically.

“How do you get that result, 

but without putting ‘forcing 
everybody’ into the same sen-
tence?” Dillard asked.

Kinesiology junior Kristin 

Roberts said she was pleasantly 
surprised by the event, noting 
jokingly she only attended for 

the free food.

“It was definitely needed,” 

Roberts said. “We could see 
that they were actually listen-
ing to us, agreeing with different 
points we were saying and kind 
of explaining what was going 
on.”

LSA junior Reid Klootwyk, 

LSA student government vice 
president, said he felt the event 
was a unique opportunity.

“I think Dean Martin and Dil-

lard are both really open to stu-
dent engagement, which is key,” 
Klootwyk said. “It’s not common 
for students to be able to engage 
in dialogue with deans, on all 
sorts of issues, and they’re open 
to hearing our voices.”

Klootwyk added that he was 

appreciative of the focus on fac-
ulty involvement in the diversity 
initiative.

“It wasn’t the proposed guide 

for the discussion, but I think 
there’s a lot to be said about the 
way that GSIs and faculty alike 
are trained,” he said. “The deans 
are the ones who make those 
calls, so yeah, it was really inter-
esting.”

S

chool buildings fester with mold and 
vermin. Students fill frigid classrooms 
beyond capacity. Teachers instruct 

from 
outdated 
text-

books, if they even have 
books at all. 

For the students and 

teachers of Detroit Pub-
lic Schools, these sen-
tences do not amount to 
a mere horror story: It is 
their reality.

The Detroit Federa-

tion of Teachers, the 
district’s primary teach-
ers union, brought these 
issues (and many more) 
to light after sick-outs 
closed more than half of Detroit’s schools 
over the past couple of weeks. Though the 
sick-outs are a fresh tactic taken on by DFT, 
the problems they protest are anything but 
new.

“Teachers in DPS have been talking about 

these things since I was in middle school,” 
said Michael Chrzan, an LSA and School of 
Education senior. Chrzan, who attended DPS 
for his entire grade-school education, gradu-
ated 
from 
Renaissance 

High School before com-
ing to the University. He 
describes his experience 
at Renaissance, one of the 
district’s premier magnet 
schools, as “atypical” com-
pared to other high schools 
in the city. Though Renais-
sance had a “college-going 
culture,” fantastic teachers 
and state-of-the-art facili-
ties, Chrzan admitted it 
was not entirely immune to 
the problems that plague the cash-strapped 
district: Outdated textbooks, large class sizes 
with inadequate resources and teacher lay-
offs were still a reality at his high school.

DPS has struggled over the past couple 

decades as the district’s enrollment has 
continually dwindled while its debt has 
increased. Emergency managers, appointed 
by the governor, have governed DPS since 
2009, after the state deemed the district 
incapable of handling its own finances. The 
emergency manager has complete author-
ity over the financial (read: all) matters of 
the district. Since emergency managers 
took over DPS, its debt has only deepened; 
in 2015, under the governance of Darnell 
Earley, 30 to 40 percent of state funds allo-
cated to DPS were used to pay off city debt 
instead. 

There is no doubt DFT’s tactics have been 

effective in exposing their cause. Photos 
posted to the union’s Twitter account gar-
nered national attention, and the American 
Federation of Teachers joined forces with 
DFT to spread their cause. Sick-outs caught 
the attention of politicians on both local and 
state levels, as Mayor Mike Duggan toured a 
handful of Detroit’s schools to inspect their 
conditions, and Gov. Rick Snyder called for 
immediate action in his State of the State 
address.

Snyder’s proposed legislation would split 

the district into an “old district” and a “new 
district.” The old district would exist solely 
to address DPS’s accumulated debt, while the 
new one, named Detroit Community School 
District, would facilitate schooling. $250 mil-
lion from the state’s general fund would fund 
the new district. A nine-member interim 
school board appointed by Snyder and Dug-
gan would govern the district until Jan. 1, 

2017, when a seven-member elected school 
board would take power.

Suspiciously absent from these plans are 

the voices of teachers, students and their 
families, without whom the need for change 
within the district would have gone unno-
ticed.

“Those closest to the problem, being stu-

dents and families, have great ideas of their 
own that they can contribute about the use of 
resources, and they should be allowed to do 
so,” said Camille Wilson, an associate profes-
sor in the School of Education.

Wilson argues that for any tangible change 

to occur, community involvement — on both 
the district and school level — is necessary.

Yet Snyder’s legislation fails to take com-

munity voices into account. In fact, the state 
seems to hush them in order to promote its 
own agenda — one that hasn’t worked over 
the past seven years. 

Teachers, for example, are kept as far 

away from the bargaining table as possible: 
Following a sick-out that closed 88 of DPS’s 
97 schools, the district filed an injunction 
against DFT and other participating parties, 
citing that the sick-outs “deprived (students) 
of their right to attend school” and are a 

“waste of taxpayer money.” 
Though the court ruled 
against the injunction, the 
state’s will to suppress the 
voice of those closest to the 
issue is cause for alarm in 
itself.

The 
legislation 
also 

implements a system that 
feigns 
autonomy. 
Sure, 

Detroiters get to elect their 
own school board, but the 
emergency 
management 

system will stay, allowing 

the state to continue to exercise control over 
the district.

The state’s rhetoric on the issue is all the 

more concerning. In his State of the State 
address, Snyder emphasized the need to 
improve students’ ability to transition from 
high school to jobs, implying that higher edu-
cation is not an attainable — or reasonable 
— goal for students in DPS. To succeed aca-
demically, students in DPS often overcome 
hardships that students in other districts do 
not, but receiving a college education certain-
ly isn’t an impossibility for them. Many DPS 
students graduate and matriculate to colleges 
each year.

At the University, however, the number of 

students hailing from DPS, Michigan’s larg-
est school district, is miniscule. Yet this is not 
a reflection of poor admissions on the Univer-
sity’s end inasmuch as it is a reflection of the 
repressive system below it. In order to level 
the playing field of college admissions, we 
must fix the problem before students’ senior 
year of high school. We must create equity 
among our country’s schools so that inner-
city students are afforded the same academic 
opportunities as students in more affluent 
neighborhoods.

Most students in Detroit simply do not 

have access to the academic and extracur-
ricular resources that students who attend 
schools in districts just outside of the city’s 
limits have. And, as of now, the state has no 
true plan to fix that.

For Detroit, perhaps the best route to 

equity is to let the people shape the district 
themselves.

F

rom my seat here in Mason 
Hall, I can hear the constant 
clicking open and closing of 

the doors, the 
sounds of hun-
dreds of fellow 
students filing in 
and out. I can see 
these 
students 

ignoring 
their 

peers’ efforts to 
try to get them 
to acknowledge 
their work on 
campus, 
with, 

at most, a dona-
tion, but more 
likely, about 15 
seconds of time — but the sacri-
fice is too great for these students. 
I acknowledge my guilt in these 
situations as well. Rushing to class, 
how dare anybody try to stop me?

Sitting here, though, hearing 

and watching all of this happen, 
I notice this guy next to me who 
is eating a banana while plugged 
into his computer screen, watch-
ing a YouTube video of some man 
talking. Every now and then, the 
fellow to my right chuckles to him-
self; alas, he has just scarfed down 
the last of the ripe banana that he 
has been caressing in his right hand 
for some time now — but instead of 
feeling the all-too-familiar loss-of-
banana blues, our man produces the 
most ferocious of chuckles yet (still 
silent, totally to himself, but as a 
witness sitting just a few feet away 
from him, I see the extraordinary 
passion in his eyes; this chuckle is 
like no other), his eyes still glued to 
the screen. Suddenly, his face turns 
serious, and his hand lowers onto 
the control pad of his laptop — per-
haps he will now be changing vid-
eos, moving on from this moment 
that has provided him with an 
intimate session of joy that no one, 
besides me, has noticed.

I wonder how he would react 

to knowing that this laughter was 
not actually private, that it has all 
been observed by me. Who am I to 
this person? Nobody — a student, a 
random student, and sure, he and 
I go to the same school, but that 
does not actually feel like it means 
all that much, does it? This shared 
affiliation of ours does not pro-
vide enough information for me to 
confidently guess anything about 
this person — his background, his 
beliefs, anything. So, in effect, I am 
nothing to this person. I don’t mean 
anything to him.

And this happens thousands of 

times, every day — passing by stu-
dents on the Diag or sitting next to 
them in the Undergraduate Library. 
These are students whom I have 
never seen before and may as well 
never see again. Sometimes, I might 
even have a nice exchange with 
one of them — earlier today, sitting 
here, a girl offered part of her table 
for the endless school supplies bil-
lowing out of my backpack. “No,” 
I said. “It’s fine. But thank you!” 
And we shared a smile, but then it 
was immediately back to business; 

she focused once again on her com-
puter, and me on mine. But I want 
more! I thought. You seem gentle 
and kind! Can we be friends?

This question of intimacy, then, 

becomes very important to my 
Michigan experience: where to find 
it, how to properly test its validity.

I have found that this phenom-

enon of passing strangers, of hav-
ing no reliably informative link 
between me and my peers, can 
often make attending this univer-
sity very difficult. It can feel like I 
am not making up any ground, like 
my experience here is becoming 
no more personalized or intimate 
or regulated by me. It instead feels 
like this stream of strangers will 
continue endlessly, regardless of 
the friends I make, and that I will 
always feel tiny here, I will always 
struggle to believe my presence 
here changes anything, at all.

The challenge becomes, then, 

to make friends whom you trust 
and care about enough; friends 
who will make the experience here 
feel sufficiently used; friends who 
provide ample space for me to feel 
socially relaxed. But this creates 
perhaps the most destructive ele-
ment of the Michigan social scene: 
Since the school is so huge and the 
feeling of isolation so scary, every-
body (myself included) finds their 
friends and then clings to that 
group tightly, holding on for dear 
life, knowing no other option. In 
the end, the campus feels colder, 
because while people have formed 
bonds 
within 
their 
respective 

social groups, hardly anyone is 
invested in the larger community. 
Hardly anyone is invested in mak-
ing new friends, friends beyond the 
group you already know, because 
to do this is to take a risk. We greet 
those people who do try to engage 
“strangers,” to begin a conversation 
across the all-too-rigid boundary, 
with silence.

This is what often makes it 

impossible, as I walk alone through 
our campus’s halls, for me to feel 
comfortable enough to be myself. 
And this lack of comfort makes me 
not want to stop for peers whom I 
do not know, even if those peers are 
trying to stop me for a valiant and 
worthy cause. Since I do not know 
you, since I have never seen you 
before and will never see you again, 
I have no reason to do you a favor. 
Sure, we go to the same school, 
but you are not a part of the group 
about which I care, the only group 
that matters to me.

And this has affected my expe-

rience here deeply, to the point 
that I have daily conversations 
with friends where we explicitly 
judge our peers based on shallow 
attributes — how they are dressed, 
whether they are in Greek life 
or not — and I find myself mak-
ing these judgments about people 
before I even speak to them. Before 
coming to Michigan, I never did 
this — at least not as consciously 
and deliberately as I do now. My 
logic goes something like this: 

Because you are not what I know, 
because you share some things that I 
associate with groups on this campus 
with which I am not familiar, we can-
not be friends. 

And my hunch is, from hearing 

students who have never set foot 
in co-ops deride them for their 
“weird dirtiness” to others describ-
ing Greek life as entirely full of bad 
people, that I am not alone, that so 
many of us are complicit. 

The 
identity 
question 
that 

divides this campus most, I think, 
pertains to Greek life: Are you in 
or out? But, for our purposes here, 
I think we can set aside our differ-
ences. I do not wish to make the 
point that this isolating and judg-
mental treatment of each other per-
tains only to one side of the social 
spectrum on campus. I have been 
kicked out of a frat party because 
of my non-Greek affiliation, even 
though I was just trying to hang 
out with a dear friend of mine from 
home, a freshman, during Welcome 
Week. Likewise, at a co-op, I was 
explicitly called out for wearing a 
specific brand of fleece. Two girls 
came up to me and sarcastically 
said, “Nice brand, man. How much 
did that cost?” Silently, dejectedly, 
I turned around and walked to 
the corner of the party where my 
friends were hanging out.

In our classes — conglomerations 

of students throughout the Univer-
sity’s social spectrum — we have 10 
minutes set aside, often before the 
professor has arrived, before class 
has “begun.” And how do we use 
this time? We take out our phones 
or our laptops: achingly, urgently 
trying to reconnect with the famil-
iar, because the world in front of 
us, inhabited by “strangers,” is 
too much to confront. Imagine a 
world without these gadgets, these 
crutches upon which we can rest 
any fear of having to interact with 
each other. Our colloquial nick-
name for these 10 minutes, “Michi-
gan Time,” makes perfect sense, for 
this time serves as a microcosm of 
the entire university, of how we all 
treat each other all the time.

And it is not only students who 

are complicit in this problematic 
social environment. Throughout 
my time here, it has been rare to 
come across an instructor who 
cared enough about the class’s 
well-being to enforce conversation 
between students. Professors only 
learn their students’ names by the 
middle of the term, and that’s only 
if the class is small enough. This 
fosters an environment of apathy 
toward one another: I only care 
about the work you do here, and 
nothing more. I only care about 
what is relevant to me.

“

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman!” 
exclaims the notorious, self-proclaimed King of 
Pop, Mr. Kanye West in a recent single, “Facts.” 

Within the song, Kanye chronicles his experience 
with corporate America, his struggle with intellectu-
al property and fallout with Nike, and his newfound 
success with Adidas, which has propelled him over 
the jumpman, Michael Jordan. The moral of Kanye’s 
“Facts” is that he simply cannot be bought or halted by 
corporations and Mr. West is by far one of the only hip 
hop artists who has taken deliberate actions toward 
denouncing corporate control over artists.

Unlike Kanye, many artists and athletes alike who 

receive endorsements are less prone to speak out on 
controversial topics or against corporate control due 
to the fear of financial loss from their respective spon-
sors. Hence, as Kanye so vividly articulates, one can 
see that endorsements and sponsorship can coerce art-
ists and athletes into acting “politically correct.” Nev-
ertheless, Kanye West’s “Facts” is a track that not only 
criticizes corporations, but any form of authoritative 
control. As a college student, particularly a student of 
color, I have found myself in coercive situations with 
an authoritarian professor on numerous occasions, 
that have always ended in me being silenced.

 Junior year, as I sat in my Engineering 202 class, 

I found myself shocked at what my professor had said 
before the class. “If you don’t bring a calculator to 

your exam, I will chase you out of here like a lynch 
mob,” noted my professor. Within the class of 50 stu-
dents I glanced over at the one other Black student, 
who I found looking back at me in awe. Her facial 
expression let me know: Yes, that just happened. 
She and I talked briefly after the class ended and we 
agreed that what we heard was completely unaccept-
able, but there was just one catch. The teacher dis-
tributed our grades.

As a result, we collectively decided not to address 

the teacher’s actions because we felt it could nega-
tively impact our class evaluation and ultimately 
our letter grades. Moreover, we were not sure if two 
Black students complaining about a tenured Cauca-
sian professor would be heard by anyone and taken 
seriously. Hence, we were ultimately silenced and 
coerced out of fear. Given how often students of color 
are the minority in classroom settings I would imag-
ine that this happens far too often. If you were ever 
wondering what a microaggression is, here is your 
example. Microaggressions are real. They are unac-
ceptable. They are coercive. And those “Facts” are 
facts only.

EnspiRED supports 
fashion for a cause

By DAILY STYLE WRITERS

On Jan. 23, EnspiRED, the 

University’s student-run fashion 
organization, hosted an Insta-
gram-worthy event right here on 
campus in celebration of its 10th 
anniversary: Rouge. Rouge was 
a fashion show meant to bring 
awareness to the arts, not only on 
campus, but also to the Fleming 
Elementary School community 
in Detroit, to which the event’s 
proceeds went. Reminiscent of 
Fashion Week, the long runway 
was surrounded by rows of seats 
for family and friends alike to 
truly appreciate the unique styles 
that strutted down the catwalk.

The event was comprised of 

eight individual themed scenes. 
Accompanied with videos, music 
and fabulous walks to match, 
the 
varied 
themes 
included 

mimes, dolls, clowns and in true 
freakshow 
fashion, 
monsters. 

With a lively and packed room, 
LSA senior Brysan Porterfield, 
EnspiRED president, said this 
year’s show yielded the largest 
amount of donations so far.

Rouge featured apparel and 

accessories from many designers 
that ranged from local Ann Arbor 
businesses to University alumni 
and high profile chains. Pitaya, 
Verbana, Victoria’s Secret, Rag-
stock and Today’s Clothing, to 
name a few, loaned clothes for 
the Rouge event. Local design-
ers such as Grant Henerson and 
Caleb Moss also helped curate 
looks. With apparel supplied 
from such varied sources, the 
range in fashion ensembles we 
saw crossed lines and transcend-
ed boundaries.

With 
an 
impressive 
and 

expansive array of sponsors, 
EnspiRED’s event was calcu-
lated and ultra posh. This atmo-
sphere was exemplified by all of 
the little extras the org provided, 
from freshly popped popcorn 
and colorfully spun cotton candy 
before the show to the various 
raffles and prizes that were given 
to lucky guests with a winning 
ticket.

Though the fashion seemed 

an afterthought compared to 
the show’s stunning theatrics, it 
was far from forgettable. Among 
the various thematic “scènes,” 
aesthetic 
standouts 
included 

the Scène du Clown, Scène de la 
Poupee, Scène la Rue and Scène 
Sauvage. The opening Scène du 
Clown consisted of relatively 
tame looks in comparison to the 

rest, but was punctuated with 
playful touches — punchy, bright 
makeup, jugglers and a skirt 
replete with balloons.

The models in the Scène de la 

Poupee channeled their inner 
dolls with more fanciful, delicate 
dresses and tutus, with the make-
up transforming models into 
mannequins. Models also slowed 
their sashays down the runway 
with an eerie stillness for a com-
plete doll effect. Scène de la Rue 
showcased the most wearable 
looks — activewear, ripped jeans, 
boss vests and an unforgettable 
gold jacket for the adventurous 
menswear shopper. Things took a 
more risqué turn as the models of 
Scène Burlesque nearly bared all 
in lingerie of the lace, silk and net 
varieties. The penultimate Scène 
Sauvage also took a strong activ-
ist stance, stressing the impor-
tance of the Black Lives Matter 
movement. Models rocked nearly 
every subtype of dress — prep, 
hippie, boho, professional and 
urban trendy.

***

Needless to say, the Daily Style 

Squad was impressed with the 
sheer amount of talent and fash-
ion choices we saw. However, 
what does it take to plan an event 
like this each year?

Turns out, a lot of hard work 

went into putting on Rouge, from 
choosing the theme to deciding 
between the carefully curat-
ed models. With the planning 
beginning in early September of 
last year, LSA junior Ify Odum, 
EnspiRED Image Consultant, 
explained to the Daily that it 
takes “a lot of teamwork, com-
munication and dedication to 
pull off a show like this.”

Besides planning the themes 

and coordinating the logistics 
for an event such as this, there 
is also the key task of assembling 
the models and the style looks. 
Everything from the clothing, 
down to the makeup and props 
used on the runway, was special-
ly designed and curated for each 
scene’s theme.

“Model 
coordinators 
work 

with fashion consultants and cre-
ative directors to ensure that the 
models we chose for this year’s 
show had the right walk, attitude 
and confidence,” Odum said.

EnspiRED’s model coordina-

tors are specifically responsible 
for choosing which outfits each 
model would wear based upon 

what they were comfortable with 
as well as what the coordinator’s 
vision was for the theme.

This wasn’t an easy pro-

cess, Odum said, adding that it 
took hours of fitting sessions 
to decide and coordinate indi-
vidual ensembles. To choose 
what each model was going to 
wear in relation to the different 
scenes, Odum and fellow image 
consultant, Darbee Pass, also an 
LSA junior, both worked for two 
days straight to decide individ-
ual outfits and get the fittings 
perfected. 

And just like in typical runway 

show fashion, there was little 
input from the models them-
selves, in terms of the outfits and 
makeup they adorned. That was 
left up to the image and fashion 
consultants to decide.

Beauty is a huge part of any 

stylized look; hair and makeup 
can make or break an outfit 
choice. Makeup artists drew 
inspiration for the makeup looks 
by working with the scenes that 
the models were in. For this 
show in particular, the makeup 
and hair was unique, trendy and 
flawless.

***

In addition to the fashions, 

what impressed us was the pro-
fessionalism of each model. Right 
away we knew this wasn’t going 
to be just a fashion show run by 
University students. The confi-
dence, grace and pure passion 
each student had on and off the 
runway made the experience all 
the more fun and authentic.

“The models practiced every 

Sunday for two hours for about 
four months,” Odum said. In 
addition, in order to walk in the 
runway show, each model had 
to do one day of community ser-
vice. One option was volunteer-
ing at the local children’s Hands 
on Museum, holding true to the 
organization’s mission of bring-
ing awareness to the arts in our 
local 
communities, 
especially 

amongst creative youths.

“Each model had their own 

reasons for modeling, whether 
it was to get over a fear or just to 
strut their stuff,” Odum said.

Having raised just shy of 

$1,000 for Fleming Elementa-
ry’s arts programs, Rouge was 
fashion for a significant cause, 
in support of creativity amongst 
University students as well as our 
local communities.

FILM NOTEBOOK
Lizzie in my dreams

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

This weekend, I traveled back 

into the depths of the grade 
school movie vault, though not 
entirely on purpose. For a class, 
I watched the original “Cinderel-
la” cartoon, which I had not seen 
for probably a decade. When I 
sat down to eat dinner one night, 
“High School Musical” was play-
ing on TV, and when I visited the 
childhood home of my roommate 
in Chicago, we unearthed a DVD 
copy of “The Lizzie McGuire 
Movie” and couldn’t resist.

While watching these movies, 

the plots were familiar, as was the 
overly emotive dialogue and high-
ly stylized sets. But what stood out 
to me most were the objects that 
surrounded these films’ construc-
tions. The beads strung up on one 
of the mouse helpers’ tails in “Cin-
derella” nearly jumped out of the 
screen and rolled across my own 
kitchen floor, so memorable to me 
they seemed completely separate 
from the plot of stepsisters and 
fairy godmothers. While watching 
“The Lizzie McGuire Movie,” my 
roommate Caroline pointed out 
every item of Lizzie’s very 2000s 
wardrobe, moments before they 
would appear on screen. “In the 
next scene she’s going to wear the 
blue hair clip.” “Wait for it, they’re 
almost to the shot of her spinning 
in the red shoes.” And when these 
objects did come up in the film, 
I could see them in the world of 

the movie just as easily as I could 
imagine them lying at the bottom 
of my cluttered closet at home.

In a class last semester, while 

talking about memoir and the 
detail of description, my teacher 
told us that half the memories we 
hold as true are actually the stuff 
of our dreams. When we speak or 
think of the past, we do not pull 
ideas from a memory storage bank 
but instead reconstruct what must 
have happened from details we 
have held on to. In another class 
about film history and theory, I 
learned that some early fictional 
films were imagined as one of the 
closest things we have to dreams, 
and the film industry was some-
times called the “dream factory.”

If we think about this connection 

between movies and dreams, and 
between dreams and memories, 
it’s difficult to find a line of separa-
tion between our own experiences 
and the events we watch play out 
on screen. With enough distance, 
everything falls into our memory 
as real, and our own lives begin to 
bounce and blend with those of the 
characters. Of course, this is dif-
ficult to do with things like events 
or locations. I know I haven’t sung 
on stage at the Roman Colosseum 
at age 14 to a crowd of my shocked 
and awed classmates and snubbed 
Italy’s most famous young pop star 
(although I really, really wish this 
had happened.) But, looking at a 
blue hair clip on screen and look-
ing at one in the bathroom cabinet 
my sister and I have stuffed with an 

inordinate amount of Claire’s mer-
chandise over the years is harder to 
differentiate.

I know this seems trivial: who 

cares where that hair clip came 
from, and who cares why it shocks 
me when it comes up in a movie? 
But what’s weird about all of this 
is the way it shocked a room full of 
girls who had grown up in differ-
ent cities, going to different schools 
and living completely separate 
lives. In a basement in Chicago, we 
were watching a pretty stupid, but 
nonetheless amazing movie and 
we all simultaneously went silent, 
realizing that something we had 
remembered as real was not ours. 
It had only lived on screen. In some 
section of our pasts, we had mixed 
in elements of some same stuff, 
and we had experienced that thing 
together from miles apart.

So what happens if we take 

Lizzie McGuire’s blue, flowery 
hairclip and switch that out with 
something bigger, like a car, or 
maybe a house, or even a city. With 
wide reaching movies like this 
one, there is a generation of kids, 
eyes wide on the screen, coming 
to know these things as ideal, and 
integrating objects they’ve never 
even touched into a wide collec-
tive memory. There’s something 
strong in that, something hard 
to nail down and understand but 
pervasive nonetheless. There’s an 
understanding that strings our 
bumping, opposing conscious-
nesses together, and a place where 
our movies fade into reality. 

CONCERT REVIEW
Elle King transcends 
at Majestic Theatre

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Music Editor

Elle King didn’t play The Majes-

tic on Wednesday night — she 
transcended in it. She has all the 
makings of a rockstar: drinks like 
a fish, swears like a sailor, dresses 
eccentrically and, most impor-
tantly, puts on a damn good rock 
show. The rescheduled, sold out 
show, refused to lose any amount 
of steam throughout King’s set. 
Draped in a black and white fur 
coat, the 26-year-old singer/song-
writer worked through material 
from her debut LP Love Stuff com-
plemented by a handful of widely-
appreciated covers.

First and foremost, an Elle 

King concert is a good time to 
be had by all. Two songs in, she 
admitted to the crowd she had 
forgotten her drink and con-
versed until one was brought to 
her — her wry sense of humor 
was the perfect complement to 
her alt. rock sound, making the 
personality, and the sometimes 
dark humor present in her music, 
feel all the more genuine. Before 
rolling 
through 
“Under 
The 

Influence,” she declared, “I’m 
drunk,” laughing with the crowd 
and asking them to raise their 
glasses because no one likes to 
drink alone. She made a spur-of-
the-moment decision to throw a 

mash up of Nick Jonas’s “Jealous” 
and The Weeknd’s “Can’t Feel My 
Face” partway through the setlist 
— demanding that even the shyer 
concert goers dance.

More dazzling than her per-

sonality, was her voice. Her sin-
gularly soaring and raspy delivery 
didn’t come as a surprise, simply 
because it was so pure on her 
record, but even live there seemed 
to be a bit more growl in her deliv-
ery, infusing more energy into the 
set. She showcased the majority of 
Love Stuff, prefacing most tracks 
with short stories on inspiration 
or uninhibited ramblings. After 
performing Grammy-nominated 
top ten hit “Ex’s & Oh’s,” King 
poked fun at herself when she 
unabashedly called herself a slut. 
King’s voice allows for both of her 
tones — lowly blues-country sing-
er on “I Told You I Was Mean,” 
“Make You Smile” and “Kocaine 
Karolina,” and growly rocker on 
“Where The Devil Don’t Go” and 
“Last Damn Night,” to maintain 
the crowd’s focus at all times. The 
band-heavy tracks pulled energy 
from the crowd, while the slower 
songs demanded attention solely 
because of King’s delivery.

At the beginning of the show, 

she announced a special surprise 
would be coming if the crowd 
stayed until the end. The sur-
prise, to make up for postponing 

the show in November, came in 
the form of a three song encore, 
which was the the energetic cli-
max. First — for Detroit — King 
spat the entirety of “The Real Slim 
Shady.” “Pinching nurses asses 
when I’m jacking off with Jergens 
/ And I’m jerking but this whole 
bag of Viagra isn’t working,” 
is way more charming behind 
King’s persona — she added some 
miming for explanation, laughing 
collectively with the crowd. Next 
up was a cover that helped get her 
noticed, a folk-indie rock mold of 
Kia’s female satisfaction anthem, 
“My Neck, My Back.” Between 
the two covers in King’s encore 
and “Oh! Darling” during the set, 
there’s no question: Elle King can 
do it all.

She capped off the show with 

her upcoming single “America’s 
Sweetheart.” She delivered the 
verses with a wicked smile and 
blew through the song’s even-
better-live chorus. Drums vibrat-
ed off every surface in the room 
and the passion of King’s deliv-
ery took the crowd just a little 
bit higher before the night was 
over, building more energy with 
each chorus. King certainly isn’t 
America’s sweetheart — she’s not 
rock ‘n’ roll’s either (yet) — but on 
Wednesday night a much-hyped 
show proved, at least for a night, 
she was Detroit’s.

T

hroughout my teen years, 
the dog days of YOLO 
summers fell into a 

monotonous rhythm — I slept the 
daylight hours away, forced older 
friends to play 
chauffeur and 
take me on 
destination-
less drives 
at dusk and 
filled the rest 
of the time 
with friends, 
food or films 
(on a good 
day, the whole 
trifecta). On 
a characteristically tame sum-
mer night, I stayed true to myself 
and stayed in, but this time it was 
socially excusable — I was recov-
ering from a nasty sunburn (an 
unfavorable outcome from the one 
day I forwent an afternoon snooze 
to “enjoy nature”). 

The year was 2010 and video 

stores were my second favorite 
destination after bookstores 
(RIP Borders on Woodward St). 
Pre-nationwide Blockbuster 
extinction, my cinematic indeci-
sion always got the best of me as I 
scoured the shelves. I could usual-
ly be found debating between the 
safe choice of “Legally Blonde” or 
something I wasn’t able to quote 
from opening to closing credits.

Elle Woods’s romantic odyssey 

suddenly seemed less interesting 
when R.J. Cutler’s Vogue docu-
mentary “The September Issue” 
caught my eye that day; or rather, 
its cover of the magazine’s icy edi-
tor-in-chief Anna Wintour. Fur-
clad, sporting a pursed pout and 
hiding behind oversized shades, it 
instilled an incalculable fear in me 
(an effect I still dream of having 
on others). I was at the peak age 
of pretending to be interesting via 
documentary viewing, so I picked 
up the fashion flick, my sunburn 
still sizzling.

Despite my ever-fleeting atten-

tion span, I was captivated for the 
entire 90 minutes. I repeatedly 
got the chills, which felt like more 
than a sunburn side effect. I like 
to think the goosebumps were my 
body’s response to a divine inter-
vention of sorts — during which 
the chic spirit of Diana Vreeland 
or Beatrix Miller propped them-
selves next to me and planted the 
seedling of my sartorial dreams. 
It sounds far-fetched, but I can’t 
fathom a logical explanation for 
my immediate attachment to 
Vogue’s creative director — the 

film’s accidental star, the frizzy 
firecracker and crazy cat lady — 
Grace Coddington.

Upon my first view of the film, 

Grace’s instant allure stemmed 
from her superficial markers. In 
the offices of the fashion bible, 
she seems completely out of 
place in her standard uniform — 
black portmanteau, bright red 
locks utterly unkempt and the 
occasional barrette highlighting 
her makeup-less face, all while 
shuffling around Condé Nast in 
orthotics. I was completely taken 
when she delivered her sharp 
British wit — uttering either wry 
backtalk to her boss, something 
comically sensible, or something 
hilariously crude. And then, 
there’s her work. At its simplest, 
she devoted her days to spinning 
our favorite fairytales in a most 
enchanting light; she made the 
contrived look effortless.

I, like most of the fashion-

inclined ilk I admire, was intro-
duced to Coddington during my 
inaugural view of the doc. Fol-
lowing what will likely remain 
my most formative viewing 
experience, I was instantly less 
interested in my future and more 
intrigued by Grace’s past. 

From that fateful day forward, I 

charted Grace’s story to the best of 
my abilities. I pored over her stun-
ning spreads, immersed myself in 
her 2012 self-titled memoir and, 
above all, loved how all her work 
reflected her distinct disposition 
— somewhere between staunch 
pragmatism and free-spirited 
romanticism. I loved how she was 
Wintour’s consummate comple-
ment and perfect foil — always 
unraveling the EIC’s tyranny with 
her autonomy.

Being the selfish being that I 

am, I tend to be most interested in 
the tales of those that I can relate 
to — so for years, I’ve been piecing 
together Grace’s narrative thread, 
which I imagine is somewhat 
similar to how she storyboards 
spreads. The more I learned about 
her, the more she reminded me 
of myself — a general loner with a 
taste for adventure, a stomach for 
uncertainty, an inherent fickleness 
and the inability to take anything 
too seriously.

So despite Coddington being 

my kindred spirit who definitely 
doesn’t know I exist, I was sad last 
Wednesday when I realized her 
decades-long Vogue chapter was 
ending — but not really. She’s still 
committed to direct four spreads 
a year, but at the age of 74, she has 

decided it time to pursue more 
professional projects — collaborat-
ing on a fragrance with Comme 
des Garçons and assisting in the 
production of her memoir biopic, 
to name a few. I was sad because 
I know, as the fashion community 
knows, that she’s completely irre-
placeable. The thought of someone 
else’s creative eye directing our 
beloved book is unsettling. I’m shy 
to embrace change, sorry.

Not unlike life itself, the fash-

ion industry is quick to change 
— with each season the dominant 
styles shift, positions are taken 
and lost and we’re reminded how 
everything is heartbreakingly 
fleeting, fickle and seldom fixed. 
When I saw the New York Times 
report on Grace’s future, I thought 
about the fashion world at large, 
past and present.

I’m not going to pretend the 

industry doesn’t have clear faults 
— latent racism, excessive fat-
shaming and a quickening pace 
that hinders creativity. But at its 
best, the industry makes us think 
and wonder. When Grace decided 
to step down, I started asking the 
questions that every generation 
within a given field asks when 
the greats and standard-setters 
start to slow down. It’s scary to 
consider the inevitability of our 
influencers fading away; it’s scary 
to think these iconic names and 
storied fashion houses will all 
be gone someday. Personally, 
the scariest part is that these 
legacy brands and publications 
will (hopefully) take chances on 
young, scrappy hooligans like me 
and expect us to take the reins 
and run with our creative impuls-
es — using only our instincts and 
influences of the bygone icons to 
set the standard for the next gen-
eration of hopefuls.

There’s a particularly moving 

scene in the doc when Grace taps 
into her signature self-awareness, 
as she stands outside the Arch-
ways Versailles (because of course 
that’s where she is). “I think I got 
left behind somewhere, ‘cause 
I’m, you know, still a romantic … 
You have to go charging ahead. 
You can’t stay behind,” she said 
in “The September Issue.” That 
scene didn’t faze me when I was 14 
and sunburnt, but last week when 
I re-watched the documentary 
and considered Grace’s future, the 
chills were alive. 

If you want to hang with Filips, 

she’ll probably send an Uber for you.

Daily Music Editor

Rihanna’s 
eighth 
studio 

album, ANTI, had much of the 
world convinced her career was 
about to take a 
blow. Between 
the 
endless 

delays, 
lack-

luster respons-
es 
to 
“Bitch 

Better 
Have 

My 
Money” 

and “American 
Oxygen” and a 
horribly-exe-
cuted album launch, Rihanna 
had dug herself quite the hole — 
a hole that desperately needed 
to be filled with an album full 
of Bad Gal Riri’s club jams fol-
lowed up by her massive world 
tour to establish her mojo again, 
but that’s not what ANTI is.

After seven albums in seven 

years 
(2005-2012), 
Rihanna 

churned out hit after hit — 
there’s a reason she’s the only 
artist to have sold 100 million 
songs. But despite all of her suc-
cess, her sound and approach 
remained stagnant, the only 
shift coming when she honed 
in on her technical skills with 
Ne-Yo (remember “Hate That 
I Love You”?), went darker on 
Rated R and embraced an island 
vibe with Loud. Beyond that, 
Rihanna’s 
consistent 
sound 

has allowed her to consistently 

maintain her Bad Gal popstar 
persona — until now.

ANTI 
offers 
the 
most 

nuanced Rihanna album yet. 
It would appear the four-
year break from dropping LPs 
loaded with dancefloor jams 
and anthemic boudoir bangers 
allowed the singer to reimagine 
her own sound, resulting in an 
experimental album the blends 
trap, R&B, soul, psychedelic 
rock, hip-hop and, of course, 
pop.

The 13-track album starts 

with bass-heavy, defiant open-
er “Consideration,” on which 
Rihanna asks a slew of ques-
tions that, if listened to, fore-
shadow the change in Rihanna’s 
sound: “Run it on back, will it 
ever make sense to me?,” “Why 
you will never let me grow?” and 
“Darling would you mind giv-
ing my reflection a break / From 
the pain it’s feeling now?” The 
track features SZA and hints at 
Rihanna’s professional frustra-
tions, going as far to say, “Let me 
cover your shit in glitter.”

And just under 45 minutes 

later it’s only Rihanna and a 
piano on “Close To You,” an 
emotionally raw ballad recount-
ing a lover lost. 

The journey between the 

two showcases Rihanna’s most 
diverse offerings, possibly even 
attaining the “timeless” sound 
she has been yearning after for 
so long.

“James Joint” and “Kiss It 

Better” comprise the roman-
tic moments of serotonin-laced 
beats. The former is a declara-
tion of a smoked-down love, and 
the latter features percussion 
and synths flowing beneath 
Rihanna’s electro delivery — 
the neon-pink aura the song 
exudes is reminiscent of Carly 
Rae Jepsen’s “All That.”

The first single from ANTI, 

“Work” soared to the top of 
the iTunes charts and took 
over radio, but the response 
felt mixed. The song’s not bad, 
but the chorus is one word and 
then, all of a sudden, Rihanna 
sounds like she’s ten drinks 
in(?). “Work” made no strong 
commitments to any singular 
sonic leaning — it’s not a pop 
masterpiece nor a trap house 
hit, but the stimulating beat and 
Rihanna’s quick delivery bol-
ster its assets.

Rihanna 
in 
“Desperado” 

begins the shift in the album to 
darker themes and heartbreak. 
The 
cinematic 
sound 
finds 

sinister urgency in the sharp 
whips of cymbals and experi-
menting with tone, creating 
an effect of walking from one 
room to another, hearing the 
music’s volume and pitch shift 
slightly. Riri and tour opener 
Travi$ Scott take ANTI to its 
darkest chapter on “Woo”. The 
instrumentation — nearly con-

stant throughout the song — is 
undoubtedly angry and the lyr-
ics are more of the same: “I bet 
she could never make you cry / 
Cause the scars on your heart 
are still mine / Tell me that she 
couldn’t get this dick.”

Anger turns into well-earned 

narcissism on “Needed Me.” 
The sensual, empowered decla-
ration of necessity tears into an 
ex: “But baby, don’t get it twist-
ed / You was just another n***a 
on the hit list / Tryna fix your 
inner issues with a bad bitch / 
Didn’t they tell you that I was a 
savage / Fuck your white horse 
and a carriage.” Moving from 
sensual to sexual, “Yeah, I Said 
It,” co-written with Timbaland, 
is notable for its relaxed deliv-
ery and lyrical couplets and 
boasts enough sex necessary for 
a proper Rihanna album — the 
bassline line alone oozes sexual 
appeal.

Perhaps the most surpris-

ing ANTI offering is a cover of 
Tame Impala’s “New Person, 
Same Old Mistakes,” “Same Ol’ 
Mistake.” The cover, still pro-
duced by Kevin Parker, doesn’t 
stray far from the original com-
position of 2015’s Currents, but 
the dark vibe and thematic ele-
ments transition the album into 
its final act. “Never Ending” 
foils the complexity of “Same 
Ol’ Mistake” with its beau-
tiful chord progression and 
unplugged production.

“Love On The Brain,” a retro 

slow jam, borrows stylistically 
from Amy Winehouse’s “Wake 
Up Alone,” to offer a tough 
sound as the song seems to rem-
inisce over Rihanna’s abusive 
relationship with Chris Brown. 
The first chorus introduces the 
dynamics, “I tried to buy your 
pretty heart, but the price too 
high,” and the chorus furthers 
the tragic love “It beats me 
black and blue, but it fucks me 
so good.”

The last track before the 

closer, “Higher” is the strongest 
vocal display Rihanna’s offered. 
No longer looking for the crisp-
ness of her previous pop-cen-
tric efforts, “Higher” features 
her raw voice, rasp included, 
in the soulful interlude to the 
album’s closer.

With her 8th studio album, 

Rihanna paints a vivid picture 
moving deliberately from track 
to track, showcasing love, loss, 
sex, abuse and personal growth. 
Waiting for ANTI seemed like 
hell to dedicated Rihanna fans, 
but it doesn’t sound like a party 
for Rihanna either. The album’s 
experimental feel for the estab-
lished superstar may turn some 
away, but Rihanna’s made it clear 
that others don’t decide what type 
of box she belongs in. If ANTI 
isn’t a concept album, it certainly 
feels like one — and a concept 
worth waiting for at that.

Rihanna’s brilliant 
and personal ‘ANTI’

Detroit’s lost ’60s 
punk band, MC5

You should listen to 
this Motor City blast 

from the past

By MELINA GLUSAC

Senior Arts Editor

On one of those listless Christ-

mas break days, when the wind is 
bitter but there isn’t any snow to 
make up for it, I decided to go to 
Third Man Records. I live about 15 
minutes from downtown Detroit 
and was, at the time, the sweaty 
kind of “embarrassed” because I 
hadn’t yet visited Jack White’s hot 
new music shop (and soon-to-be 
record factory). So I went, a good 
month after its opening.

The place is loaded with vin-

tage knick-knacks, guitar-heavy 
vinyl and other Nashville-punk 
impedimenta — so, yes, it reeks 
of White. But that’s a damn sexy 
smell to emit, if I should be so 
bold. A series of headphones and 
small screens popping out of the 
wall at the back of the shop drew 
me in like a weary sailor to a mer-
maid — what was there to listen 
to, to behold? Unreleased White 
Stripes stuff? More face-melting 
guitar solos? Clips of White eating 
his breakfast (I imagine he starts 
his day off right with cigarettes, 
whiskey and blues progressions), 
a la DJ Khaled? I intended to find 
out.

My father beat me to the punch 

and was taking off his headphones 
as I arrived at the last station.

“That was so cool,” the sub-

urban gent that spawned me 
exclaimed.

I looked at his screen and saw a 

handful of scraggly-looking dudes 
in black and white, performing 
some explosive live outdoor con-
cert in Detroit in, like, 1969. The 
lead singer was way too into it.

“Who the hell are they?” I 

squinted at the screen. “What is 
MC5?”

Dad was shocked to find out 

about my lack of musical knowl-
edge. (Why is he still smarter 
than me? Is college working?) He 

explained how crucial the band 
was, how amazing, how crazy-
long-lasting-influential 
their 

music was on the rock genre and 
especially the punk scene. Punk 
rockers. From Detroit. In the 
’60s. Okay, I could wrap my head 
around that — but legends? I 
didn’t know. They must be good, 
I thought hesitantly, if White 
devoted a little corner wall and 
headphone set to their legacy in 
his slightly self-indulgent shop. 
There must be something there.

So, naturally, I put off listen-

ing to them for a few days. Part 
nervousness, 
part 
embarrass-

ment, again — but if it wasn’t too 
late to go to Third Man Records, 
it wasn’t too late to start listening 
to MC5, alone, in my room, a few 
days before school started back up 
again. Cue: “Kick Out The Jams 
(Live)” and the beginning of a 
Spotify-driven, MC5 introductory 
shuffle session. 

“Kick Out” is the one they’re 

known for, and that’s completely 
as it should be because the song 
could demolish a building after 
one play, probably. Ramming gui-
tars, white-knuckles-on-the-dash-
board drums with melodious lines, 
it begins — ever-so-subtly — “Kick 
out the jams, motherfucker!” Um, 
MC5, your punk is showing.

I was hooked. I am hooked. I 

can try to blame it on the voice 
— the late Rob Tyner’s pipes 
are both soulful and edgy, pas-
sionate and hard, crunchy with 
a little bit of chocolate syrup 
deftly drizzled into the mix. But 
then I can also blame it on the 
instrumentation — it’s tough to 
dispute the virtuosity, the raw 
emotion of Wayne Kramer and 
Fred “Sonic” Smith on the guitar. 
There wouldn’t be an MC5 with-
out that six-stringed goodness. 
And then, of course, I could talk 
about the oft-overlooked back-
bones: Michael Davis’s intricate 
bass riffs, Dennis Thompson’s 
ramming drums. With any band, 
though, it’s the combination of all 
those elements that’s ultimately 
the culprit, the reason for excel-
lence and listen-ability, and MC5 

is no exception to that rule. They 
just worked.

But then, a song emerges from 

the rock ‘n’ roll fog and clangs at 
the elusive tuning-fork artery in 
your heart. A case like this is rare. 
And it makes you cry and smile 
and it lets you know that the band 
you’re listening to — MC5 — is any-
thing but just another rock group 
from the ’60s. “Miss X” starts up 
easy, some thudding piano chords 
occupying its first few precious 
seconds, but then gun-gun-gun-
gun-gun—“Oh, now, yeeeah!” It 
starts for real, oozing sex and angst 
and frustration at an exponential 
punk-rock rate. A tonally descend-
ing background singers mirror 
Tyner’s dilemma, his own descent 
into the body of the woman that 
makes him weak. He pushes and 
pushes, with “undulating hips,” 
until one final yawp to end all 
yawps ever yawped is yawped. It’s 
desperation; it’s love; it’s pain; it’s 
love. And damn it, isn’t that what 
all musicians have been banging 
on about, for all these years?

I don’t know when this affair 

will end. It’s not under cover of 
darkness, nor is it shameful. I’ve 
been telling everyone I’ve run into 
the past few weeks about my burn-
ing obsession, but no one seems to 
understand how badly I want to be 
Miss X.

***

Dad called me the other night, 

and I told him what this article 
was going to be about.

“Oh, so now you’re a fan?”
Well, I’d like to thank Jack 

White for introducing me to the 
backbone, the invisible inspiration 
behind so many bands that have 
existed post-MC5. And Detroit, for 
housing the shaggy-headed gang 
that birthed Kick Out The Jams 
(Live), Back in the USA, and High 
Time, three of the most important 
albums since ’69. Together, they’ve 
made the new semester a little less 
lost, a little less listless and a lot 
more rock ‘n’ roll.

So sonically speaking, I’m in 

love.

Top line shines as ‘M’ cruises past Penn State

By JUSTIN MEYER 

Daily Sports Writer

STATE COLLEGE — Just 

outside the closing minute of the 
first period, Michigan senior 
goaltender 
Steve Racine 
lay 
in 
the 

crease with 
his face buried in the ice as the 
crowd roared.

Off to a shaky start, Racine 

had just conceded a cringe-
worthy goal to No. 15 Penn State 
on a shot from outside the blue 
line.

A fan held a sign up to the 

glass reading: “It’s all your 
fault!”

And it was Racine’s fault. He 

had hit the puck with his glove, 
missing an easy save, only to see 
it drop behind him into the net 
to make the score 2-2.

But the goalie stayed there 

for only a second before picking 
himself up off the ice. And, 
eventually, 
the 
sixth-ranked 

Wolverines picked themselves 
up, too, besting the Nittany 
Lions, 7-4.

“That was a good test for 

our goalie and our team — not 
to let that goal upset us,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“We didn’t.”

For the hockey purist, the 

first period was one to forget. 
But boy, was it exciting.

Michigan (6-1-2 Big Ten, 15-3-

4 overall) opened the scoring 
amid confusion. Junior forward 
Tyler Motte put away a puck 
that fluttered high above the ice 
and fell almost directly to his 
stick in front of the left post.

Penn State’s Chase Berger 

countered by working through 
traffic to beat Racine to a 
rebound.

Then, 
it 
was 
sophomore 

forward Niko Porikos scoring 
form the high slot with his first 
career goal on an assist from his 

linemate, junior forward Evan 
Allen. Those two had played 
a combined 19 of a possible 
44 games this year going into 
Thursday.

The 

pandemonium 
was capped off 
in Michigan’s 
defensive end 
with Racine’s 
error. A long 
shot 
hit 
the 

goalie square 
in the chest 
and bounced. 
The 
senior 

knocked the rebound with his 
glove and watched, helplessly, 
as the puck lazily drooped 
backward over his head and into 

the net. Not a single Penn State 
player was in the offensive zone.

It was a wild way to open 

the game, but that might have 

been expected 
given 
the 

recent history 
between 
the 

two teams. The 
Wolverines 
have 
been 

frustrated 
by 

the 
Nittany 

Lions 
over 

the past two 
seasons 
— 

Penn 
State 

eliminated Michigan from the 
Big Ten Tournament in 2014 and 
the Wolverines dropped three of 
four regular season matchups to 

the Nittany Lions in 2015.

The combination of similar 

styles and impressive speed 
made for a jolting contest in 
which momentum was nearly 
impossible to find.

“(Penn State has) earned 

a lot of respect from the Big 
Ten 
conference,” 
Berenson 

said. “Particularly with us, the 
way they’ve handled us. We 
had to have an A-game ready, 
otherwise it wouldn’t be good 
enough.”

Michigan 
was 
closest 
to 

establishing 
control 
in 
the 

second period. Freshman Kyle 
Connor 
and 
juniors 
Tyler 

Motte and JT Compher have 
easily outscored any other line 
in college hockey this month. 

That trend continued with a 
string of three goals when the 
Wolverines’ electric first line 
put Penn State in a 5-3 hole.

“It can be any line, as we’ve 

seen from the beginning of the 
year, with Cooper Marody’s line 
really getting off to a hot start,” 
Motte said. “I guess it’s our turn 
now.”

Connor, alone, has 20 goals 

in 
22 
games 
this 
season. 

Continuing 
his 
streak, 
the 

19-year-old had two goals and 
two assists on Thursday night. 
He opened the scoring by 
finishing a breakaway gifted by 
a diving play from Motte.

Connor later found Compher 

alone in front with a perfect 
backhand pass and capped off 

the period by batting a rebound 
out of the air.

Penn State (6-3-0, 16-6-3) 

finally got going again with just 
over three minutes to play in the 
period on a goal from Tommy 
Olczyk — but it wasn’t nearly 
enough.

The third period got off to 

an odd start when Michigan’s 
coaches were absent for the 
puck drop.

“This 
building 
wasn’t 

designed for the visiting coaches 
to get to the bench,” Berenson 
said. “You have to walk down 
this hall and it seems like you 
go around campus to get to the 
visitor’s bench. So we didn’t 
leave on time. We missed the 
first shift. The players were all 
laughing about it on the bench.

“I’m 
not 
sure 
who 
was 

coaching.”

Neutral zone play opened 

up in the third and the Nittany 
Lions threatened throughout 
the 
final 
period. 
Michigan 

answered the challenge, though, 
tightening up defensively and 
adding a pair of goals.

Penn State didn’t help itself 

in the third period either, 
conceding a long 5-on-3 power 
play for the Wolverines. A late 
goal simply wasn’t enough to 
climb out of the growing deficit.

It wasn’t always pretty, but 

Michigan played a resilient 
60 
minutes 
of 
hockey 
in 

State College. And they were 
victorious, despite the dejected 
Racine lying on the ice at the 
end of the first. It just wasn’t 
the same old story of the 
Nittany Lions frustrating the 
Wolverines.

Michigan and Penn State will 

meet again Saturday night at 
Madison Square Garden in New 
York, part of a doubleheader 
with 
the 
Wolverines’ 
and 

Nittany Lion’s basketball teams. 

Hopefully, next time, the 

coaches can get to the bench. 

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Freshman forward Kyle Connor has scored 20 goals in 22 games this season, including two against Penn State on Thursday at Pegula Ice Arena.

“(Penn State) has 

earned a lot of 
respect from the 

Big Ten.” 

Dawkins blends style and practicality

By LEV FACHER 

Daily Sports Writer

Thirty minutes before the 

start of any Michigan men’s 
basketball game, all eyes are on 
Aubrey Dawkins.

As the Wolverines huddle at 

center court for a final check-in, 
the sophomore guard emerges 
from 
the 
pack 
carrying 
a 

basketball and a grin. His task 
is simple: provide Michigan, and 
any fans already in their seats, 
with a healthy dose of pregame 
energy before the team jogs 
through Crisler Center’s south 
tunnel en route to the locker 
room.

Dawkins gets it done with a 

dunk.

Some days, it’s a 360-degree 

spin 
leading 
into 
a 
two-

handed slam. Others, it’s a left-
hand finish off an alley-oop 
Dawkins throws himself off 
the backboard. Sometimes, a 
teammate throws him the lob, 
and occassionally, it’s as simple 
as a soaring, right-handed spike 
off a jump Dawkins starts from a 
distance that seems impossible.

As it happened Wednesday, 

the soaring right-handed spike 
did prove impossible during 
the second half of Michigan’s 
68-57 victory over Rutgers. Had 
Dawkins converted, he would 
have found himself the star 
of SportsCenter. Instead, the 
missed dunk became an emblem 
for a flat, uninteresting game 
that saw the Wolverines struggle 
to put away a team still winless 
in eight tries against Big Ten 
opponents.

Dawkins 
described 
the 

attempt as “Blake Griffin-esque” 
after the game and said he “most 
definitely” would be admonished 
down the line by Michigan coach 
John Beilein.

“He 
has 
to 
understand: 

You’ve got to be good before 
you’re great,” Beilein said in 
his postgame press conference. 
“You can’t skip steps. I think he 
understands that. … We had the 
same thing with Glenn Robinson 
(III), who had a lot of ‘my bads’ 
when he tried to dunk it with 
one hand — and Mitch McGary.” 
 

The comparison to Robinson, 

who left for the NBA Draft 

after the 2013-14 season, was 
more apt than perhaps even 
Beilein realized. Robinson was 
Dawkins’ predecessor as the 
performer of the pregame dunk, 
but it’s a ritual that, bizarrely, 
Michigan coaches never witness 
live.

Beilein, along with assistants 

Bacari Alexander and LaVall 
Jordan, haven’t yet emerged 
from the locker room when dunk 
time rolls around. Beilein’s third 
assistant, Jeff Meyer, supervises 
warmups, but he returns to the 
locker room before the players 
and isn’t there to watch the final 
minutes.

“I’ve never seen it,” Meyer 

said before Wednesday’s game. 
“I leave when the clock reads 36 
minutes (before tipoff).”

The dunk takes place closer to 

the 32-minute mark, and it might 
be better that way. Dawkins, who 
lost his starting spot early in the 
season, displays as much raw 
basketball talent as any of his 
teammates. At points throughout 
his two years at Michigan, 
however, his athleticism has 
seemed to translate to the type 
of ostentatiousness on display 

Wednesday. The lesson, Beilein 
said, is obvious.

“Go up and dunk it with two 

(hands),” Beilein said. “It’ll still 
make the highlight reel. Just go 
up, but get it with two hands.”

Dawkins, 
for 
his 
part, 

understands his limitations. The 
miss Wednesday was more a 
miscalculation than an attempt 
at posterization, Dawkins said 
— he jumped from seven feet 
away because he expected to 
draw contact once the Rutgers 
defender met him in the air.

With no red jerseys nearby, 

Dawkins instead found himself 
hurtling through open space, 
with a desperation attempt at 
essentially throwing the ball 
through the rim his only hope of 
converting on the place.

Dawkins, 
speaking 
to 

reporters on Tuesday, said he 
doesn’t have a go-to dunk and 
unknowingly 
foreshadowed 

Wednesday’s miss.

“There’s only so many dunks 

you can really do,” he said. 
“Especially ones you can make 
consistently.”

Modest as he is, Dawkins’ 

arsenal is hardly limited. Given 

his athleticism and the dunking 
ability he possessed as a true 
freshman, there was never much 
doubt as to who might replace 
Robinson.

“Usually the most athletic 

guy does it,” said junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. on Tuesday. 
“It was kind of obvious that once 
that time of warmups comes, 
everybody would pretty much 
back up and let (Dawkins) do 
what he does.”

Junior forward Zak Irvin 

said Tuesday that Dawkins is 
the Wolverines’ best jumper, 
echoing Walton’s recollection 
that Dawkins became the natural 
choice to succeed Robinson as 
soon as he arrived on campus.

The vast majority of the 

time, 
the 
abilities 
Dawkins 

displays in warm-ups and in 
practice translate seamlessly to 
his in-game performance. The 
mentality, of course, is different. 
Dawkins gets a second chance 
if he misses his pregame dunk. 
He was afforded no such second 
chance Wednesday. 

Then again, there was no 

need for second chances against 
Rutgers. 

Foul trouble hurts 
‘M’ in loss at Iowa

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

Foul trouble has been a 

problem 
for 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team the 
entire 
season, and 
Thursday’s 
game 
against Iowa in Iowa City was 
no exception.

The 
Wolverines 
received 

a 31-point performance from 
sophomore 
guard 
Katelynn 

Flaherty — her fourth 30-point 
game of the season — but it 
wasn’t enough for Michigan to 
overcome its foul trouble in the 
post, as the Wolverines fell to 
the Hawkeyes, 85-69. 

The sophomore guard shot 

5-of-6 from 3-point range on 
her way to 24 points in the first 
half. 

Michigan only trailed by 

one at the break, but it was all 
downhill from there.

“We were up, I think our 

confidence was good, I think 
we were getting in transition,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes Arico in an interview 
with MGoBlue.com. “Katelynn 
was really shooting the ball 
exceptionally well, and then we 
had a bunch of fouls where we 
might have been up 10 at one 
point, and then they started 
making their foul shots and 
they cut the gap.”

Michigan was in foul trouble 

early, specifically in the post, 
as 
senior 
forward 
Kelsey 

Mitchell and freshman center 
Hallie 
Thome 
committed 

three and two first-half fouls, 
respectively.

The 
team’s 
foul 
trouble 

pushed Iowa into the bonus 
with 2:36 left in the first half, 
sparking a 13-4 run to end the 
opening stanza, with five of 
those points coming from the 
charity stripe.

Michigan started the second 

half cold, missing its first five 
shots as Iowa extended its lead 
to 10 with 4:36 to go in the third 

quarter.

Thome quickly committed 

her third foul less than three 
minutes 
into 
the 
second 

half, further adding to the 
Wolverines’ trouble in the post, 
as she headed to the bench yet 
again.

With Thome taking another 

seat, 
Iowa 
forwards 
Chase 

Coley and Megan Gustafson 
took advantage of the foul 
trouble inside, as both players 
posted double-doubles in points 
and rebounds.

“Defensively we did a decent 

job on them in the first half,” 
Barnes Arico said. “But in the 
first half they made seven 3s, 
so (in the second half) they 
weren’t making as many 3s, 
they were really trying to attack 
inside, and that’s been an area 
of struggle for us all year.”

With two starters looking 

to avoid fouling out, Michigan 
needed to get production from 
other sources. 

But the team did not receive 

much support from its bench 
in the loss. The Iowa reserves 
outscored 
the 
Wolverines’ 

bench, 33-6, and even though 
four 
Michigan 
starters 

made it to double digits, it 
wasn’t enough to counter the 
Hawkeyes’ advantage off the 
bench.

A crucial part of Michigan’s 

downfall was Iowa’s 84-percent 
shooting from the free-throw 
line, as the Hawkeyes took full 
advantage of Michigan’s 23 
total fouls. 

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

were able to cut the deficit to 
six in the final minutes, Iowa 
imposed its will on the game 
and pushed its lead to 16, the 
Hawkeyes’ eventual margin of 
victory.

“Losing is never fun, and 

it’s never easy for anyone and 
I just think that it’s a process,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Instead of 
looking at the wins and losses, 
a lot of times we’ve just got to 
look at ‘OK, let’s be better next 
game.’ ”

Timeline: Hackett’s A.D. tenure

By JAKE LOURIM 
& MAX BULTMAN

Managing Sports Editors

With 
Connecticut 
athletic 

director Warde Manuel set to take 
over the same role at Michigan, 
interim Athletic Director Jim 
Hackett’s tenure is winding to a 
close.

In possibly the most productive 

15-month 
stretch 
in 
Athletic 

Department 
history, 
Hackett 

oversaw the transition from Brady 
Hoke to Jim Harbaugh as football 
coach, negotiated a record apparel 
deal with Nike and extended 
basketball coach John Beilein’s 
contract, among other initiatives.

Hackett, a former Steelcase 

CEO 
and 
Wolverine 
football 

player, returned to his alma mater 
at a time of relative instability 
and will leave the department in 
better shape than he found it. The 
Daily looks back at some of the 
highlights of his tenure.

Oct. 31, 2014: Dave Brandon 

resigns, Hackett named interim 
Athletic Director.

Amid 
mounting 
public 

dissatisfaction 
from 
students 

as well as alumni and donors, 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
accepted 
Brandon’s 

resignation 
and 
announced 

Hackett as the interim Athletic 
Director. At the time, Schlissel 
said the decision was “in the best 
interest of student-athletes, the 
Athletic Department and the 
University community.”

Dec. 2, 2014: Hackett fires 

Brady Hoke.

Following a 5-7 season that 

included losses to Michigan’s 
three biggest rivals — Notre 
Dame, Ohio State and Michigan 
State — as well as defeats against 
Big Ten newcomers Maryland and 
Rutgers, Hackett decided it was 
time to let Hoke go.

In a statement, Hackett said: 

“This was not an easy decision 
given the level of respect that I 
have for Brady. He has done a 
great job of molding these young 
men, making them accountable to 
their teammates, focusing them 
on success in the classroom and in 
the community.

“I wanted to make sure that 

Brady received adequate time 
to exhibit the results that would 
come from his effort and I believe 
that Brady and our coaching staff 
had enough time to produce those 
results and unfortunately they are 
not there. In the end, I feel that 
moving in a different direction is 
the right decision.”

In the same press conference 

came his remark about the 
Athletic Department’s commonly 
used term of pride.

“I want to get rid of the word 

‘Michigan Man,’ ” Hackett said 
that day. He did so to avoid 
restricting it to men, to leave Bo 
Schembechler’s original remark 
in context and to emphasize the 
selflessness that goes along with 
the term.

And thus began a coaching 

search Hackett later revealed as 
being called “Project Unicorn.” 
You presumably know the result, 
but in case you don’t…

Dec. 30, 2014: Jim Harbaugh 

introduced as head football 
coach.

Harbaugh was the golden goose, 

the prized unicorn of Hackett’s 
search. After weeks of rumors 

both promoting and tempering 
the 
possibility 
of 
Harbaugh 

returning 
to 
Michigan, 
the 

former All-American quarterback 
was announced as the team’s 
new coach. In just two months, 
Hackett had already delivered the 
prize that will headline his tenure.

At the time, then-redshirt 

junior center Jack Miller praised 
the deal, giving Hackett the bulk 
of the credit. “I knew it was going 
to be something special if we got 
it done,” Miller said at Harbaugh’s 
announcement. “Kudos to Jim 
Hackett for doing that. … We 
hit the home run everyone was 
looking for.”

April 1, 2015: Hackett holds 

fireside chat to interact with 
students.

When 
Hackett 
took 
over, 

the popularity of the Athletic 
Department was at a low point. 
Ticket sales to both alumni and 
students had plummeted, and 
numerous off-field incidents had 
plagued the department as the fall 
of 2014 wore on. Students were 
planning to wear shirts calling 
for Brandon’s firing at the football 
game against Indiana the day 
after he resigned. 

One 
of 
Hackett’s 
main 

achievements was restoring the 
pride in the Athletic Department 
and repairing relationships with 
the students. While he achieved a 
good portion of that effort just by 
replacing Hoke with Harbaugh, 
he also took the time to interact 
with students on their views at a 
fireside chat last spring.

At that point, Hackett was also 

in the process of evaluating the 
apparel deal that he signed three 
months later. He also expressed 
a desire to improve the fan 
experience at Michigan Stadium, 
making it less “corporate.”

“I 
don’t 
want 
to 
sound 

sarcastic,” Hackett said at the 
time. “What I don’t want is more 
entertainment that’s not football. 
I think that works in the pros, but 
we’re in college. I believe college 
shouldn’t be like the pros. It 
shouldn’t cost like the pros.”

Another 
aspect 
involved 

playing less piped-in music in 
the stadium and using more of 
the Michigan Marching Band. 
In 
September, 
band 
director 

John Pasquale said he had seen 
improvement in that area.

And, of course, the chat was 

the first interaction with students 
about Harbaugh’s hiring. The 
enthusiasm 
showed, 
and 
the 

results followed on the field last 
fall.

July 6, 2015: Michigan agrees 

to apparel deal with Nike 
through 2027.

In total fairness, this couldn’t 

have been a hard decision to make. 
Nike is an apparel juggernaut, and 
the Michigan brand is so valuable 
that the school had Nike, Under 
Armour and Adidas all competing 
for it. However, the deal Michigan 
got was quite impressive.

The financial figures of the 

deal were released later in July, 
totaling $169 million over the 15 
years of the contract. Over the 
course of the contract, the money 
will be divided into $76.8 million 
in cash, $80.2 million worth 
of apparel and $12 million in 
up-front money last summer.

“After careful consideration, 

the 
right 
partner 
for 
the 

University of Michigan was Nike,” 
Hackett said at the time. “This 
decision, this partnership is about 
more than Michigan athletics; at 
the core, it is about our University 
community and it is about two 
great names reuniting for an 
opportunity that speaks to more 
than uniforms and apparel.”

In another part of the deal, 

Michigan 
will 
become 
the 

first football team to wear the 
“Jumpman” logo, part of the 
Jordan Brand, and the men’s and 
women’s basketball teams will 
also join the Jordan Brand family.

Oct. 18, 2015: Hackett writes 

an open letter to Michigan fans 
in support of the football team.

The day before was one of the 

low points of his tenure. Seeking 
its first win over Michigan State 
since 2012, the Michigan football 
team never trailed until the 
final second of the game. With 
10 seconds to go, and with the 
Wolverines ahead 23-21, fifth-
year senior punter Blake O’Neill 
dropped the snap on what could 
have been a game-ending punt. 
He took a hit when he picked up 
the ball, and Michigan State’s 
Jalen Watts-Jackson returned it 
for a touchdown to win the game.

Some Michigan fans took to 

social media to express their 
frustration by criticizing O’Neill 
after the game.

The following day, Hackett 

wrote an open letter on the 
Athletic Department’s website 
condemning those fans’ actions.

“Today I awake to the shocking 

reality that our community who 
care so much about this program 
would send hurtful, spiteful and 
vicious comments to one of our 
students,” Hackett said. “To be 
clear, such comments come from a 
small minority, none of whom are 
reflective of our institution.

“The people I have been 

associated with my whole life 
around this fantastic program — 
some whom are living and some 
whom have passed on — would 
never, I repeat never, spread 
blame.”

Nov. 4, 2015: Hackett extends 

Beilein’s contract through the 
2020-21 season.

Four 
weeks 
before 
the 

University announced it would 
start 
looking 
for 
Hackett’s 

replacement, 
the 
 
athletic 

director’s last significant action 
was signing Beilein to a two-year 
contract extension. The coach 
said after the deal that the extra 
security helps with recruiting 
players and assuring them that he 
will be the coach for the duration 
of their careers.

Beilein, who turns 63 next 

Friday, is in his ninth season at 
Michigan with a 182-115 overall 
record.

“John is one of the most 

respected coaches in the country 
and revered people within the 
university community,” Hackett 
said in a statement. “While he has 
accomplished many great things 
on the basketball court, it is his 
leadership, guidance and role as 
an educator that truly makes him 
one of our great ambassadors. We 
look forward to John continuing 
to represent the University of 
Michigan for many years to 
come.”

Dec. 2, 2015: Schlissel begins 

a search for a permanent 
athletic director.

In 13 months on the job, 

Hackett had accomplished more 
than anyone could have expected 
him to, especially considering the 
circumstances he inherited. But 
Hackett’s status was always in the 
short term, and after a little more 
than a year, the end neared.

With the football season over, 

the apparel contract signed and no 
open coaching vacancies, Schlissel 

began another transition. He 
would head a seven-member 
search 
committee 
comprising 

Hackett; his special counsel, 
Liz Barry; the faculty athletic 
representative, 
Anne 
Curzan; 

women’s soccer player Corinne 
Harris; 
softball 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins; Chief Financial Officer 
Kevin Hegarty; and alumnus 
Stefan G. Humphries.

While 
announcing 
the 

search, Schlissel expressed his 
appreciation for Hackett.

“I could not have asked for 

more from a leader,” he said in 
a statement. “He stepped up 
at a moment of need and has 

served the institution with great 
distinction. Personally, he has 
been a pleasure to work with and 
I will always owe him a debt of 
gratitude.”

Meanwhile, Hackett, in one 

of his last public remarks as the 
Athletic Director, looked back on 
his time in the position as a “love 
story.”

“It 
began 
with 
President 

Schlissel calling and asking if I 
could help,” Hackett said. “I have 
another friend in business who 
said sometimes you do things 
for God and country. I love the 
University, and I felt compelled to 
come and help.”
