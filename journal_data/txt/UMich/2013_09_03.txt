'U' changes sex
misconduct
procedures

PICK YOUR PRODUCE

New policy demands
investigations into
all allegations
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Online Editor
The University has adopted a new
policy for how it responds to student
sexual-misconduct allegations, tran-
sitioning from a complainant-driven
model to one driven by University
investigators.
Per the policy, the University has
assumed the burden of internally
investigating all allegations of student
sexual misconduct, which includes
allegations of sexual harassment and
sexual assault. The policy doesn't deal
with the criminal repercussions that
result from law enforcement investi-
gations, which are outlined in federal,
state and local laws.
A 2011 Department of Education
mandate clarified that Title IX, the
federal anti-sex- discrimination stat-
ute, obligates universities to actively
investigate sexual misconduct alle-
gations. In response, the University
reviewed its sexual misconduct alle-
gation policies and implemented an
interim policy in August 2011.
The newly effective final policy fol-
lows fine-tuning process over the last
two years, which broughttogether the
directors of the Office of Student Con-
flict Resolution, the Office of Insti-
tutional Equity, the Sexual Assault

Awareness and Prevention Center
and a staff member in the Office of
the General Counsel. In addition to
discussions at several community
forums, survivors of sexual assault
and other people who were impacted
by the previous policy were also con-
sulted.
The policy also instructs the Title
IX coordinator, the person who
ensures the University follows the
mandate's regulations, to notify law
enforcementofpotentialcriminalsex-
ual misconduct allegations. This may
prevent situations where investigators
know about criminal misconduct alle-
gations but do not inform police. This
seemingly occurred recently when
reports of sexual misconduct at the
Zaragon Place apartments were not
conveyed to University police until a
third student came forward making
accusations against the suspect intwo
previous assaults.
The new policy clarifies that only
three University divisions - SAPAC,
Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vices and the Office of Ombuds -
offer full confidentiality to students
who report misconduct. It states that
students should assume that reports
made to any other University official
will be shared with the Title IX coor-
dinator and investigated following the
new procedure.
Non-confidential sources include
professors and residential advisers.
This has raised some concern over
whether survivors could unknowing-

Embattled leader
asks for proof of
chemical warfare
PARIS (AP) - France released
an incelligence reportcon Monday
alleging chemical weapons use
by Syria's regime that dovetailed
with similar U.S. claims, as Pres-
ident Bashar Assad warned that
any military strike against his
country would spark an uncon-
trollable regional war and spread
"chaos and extremism."
The verbal crossfire, includ-
ing a rejection of the Western

allegations by longtime Syrian
ally Eussia, was parc of frenzied
efforts on both sides to court
international public opinion
after President Barack Obama
said, he would seek authorization
from Congress before launch-
ing any military action against
Assad's regime.
In an interview with French
newspaper Le Figaro, Assad was
quoted as saying that Syria has
challenged the U.S. and France
to provide proof to support their
allegations, but that their lead-
ers "have been incapable of doing
that, including before their own
peoples."

"If the Americans, the French
or the British had a shred of proof,
they would have shown it begin-
ning on the first day," he said,
deriding Obama as "weak" and
having buckled to U.S. domestic
political pressure.
"We believe that a strong man
is one who prevents war, not one
who inflames it," Assad said.
French President Francois
Hollande and Obama have been
the two world leaders most
vocally calling for action against
Assad's regime, accusing it of
carrying out a deadly chemical
attack against rebel-held sub-
urbs of Damascus on Aug. 21.

Unsigned editorials reflect the official position of the Daily's editorial board.
All other signed articles and illustrations represent solely the views of their authors.

The first Football Saturday has passed and
undergraduate classes are underway - and
that means The Michigan Daily is back for
our 124th year of production. I'd like to take a
few paragraphs to introduce you, or reintro-
duce you, to the largest student newspaper at
the University oftMichigan.
The Daily produces five weekly editions,
maintains a continuously updated website
and is produced entirely by a staff of about
200 University students. The paper has been
and will always be editorially independent of
the University. There are a few professional
staff members who assist our business staff -
the students who handle the Daily's finances
and advertising - but students, like myself,
are ultimately responsible for all content that
goes into print.
With that said, we aim for complete trans-
parency with the community we serve and
take responsibility when we break that trust
by straying from our mission of fairness and
accuracy. Never hesitate to contact me -at
anweiner@michigandaily.com or @andrew-
weiner. When we make a mistake, we want
to know about it: Send any corrections to cor-
rections@michigandaily.com and we'll make
the change online and run a correction in the
next newspaper.
Reading a printed newspaper too old fash-

ioned for you? We're all over the Internet.
Beyond our easy-to-navigate website, we
maintain a robust presence on social media at
www.twitter.com/MichiganDaily and www.
facebook.com/MichiganDaily. This sum-
mer, we began uploading each day's paper to
www.issuu.com/MichiganDaily, so you can
read the print edition if you can't grab a copy'
around Ann Arbor.
This semester is full of changes when it
comes to the Daily: We've brought back live-
blogging a variety of events and games, and
now we're running book reviews with the
help of a local bookstore Literati. And now
we've spun sports coverage back from our
sister site to the main website.
Lastly, we're always looking for students to
join our staff. Check out www.michigandaily.
com/join-us to contact any of our editors. The
best way to find out if the Daily is for you is
to attend a mass meeting in the newsroom at

7:30 p.m - we hope to see you there!

Andrew Weiner is the editor in chief.

his past summer, I lived
and interned in Wash-
ington, D.C. While I was
there, I learned
to love D.C.
for its quirks. I
loved that after
work meant .
going to happy
hour and that,
as a born-again
omnivore, there ZOE
was a never-E
ending supply of STAHL
burgers to try. I
loved picnics in
Meridian Park for lunch and runs
by the monument at night.'
But as much as I enjoyed being
in D.C., there were some things
I just couldn't get used to: The
muggy days didn't do it for me, nor
did the long waits for the always
overcrowded Metro.
What I really couldn't stomach
was how certain all of my fellow
college-aged interns were about
everything. On the Red Line to
Union Station, I heard a Senate
intern announce with absolute
confidence that "Hillary has these
next two terms in the bag. We'll
have Gov. O'Malley after that, but
for only one term. After that, you
know, we will gotta swing back, so
a Republican for two terms. Not
sure exactly who yet."
I also heard other twenty-some-
things announce their "politically
viable" plans to solve the Arab-
Israeli conflict, income inequality
and our public education system.
They all knew exactly what they

were talking about.
At first, I was impressed and even
jealous of how self-assured they
were. However, I soon realized how
this very certainty was actually
blinding them, making them unwill-
ing to hear the opinions of others -
or even just the facts.
In my head, I blamed their par-
ents. They must have praised their
kids for tying their shoes for the
100th time or remembering to say
"thank you" at age 12 - all in the
name of their children's self-esteem.
I blamed the colleges they
attended, too. I knew that these
schools - like ours - constantly
remind them that they are the
smartest, they are the elite, they
are destined for greatness.
But then I realized that I myself
was a little too certain. After see-
ing "Fruitvale Station," I caught
myself saying, "It will win the
Oscar for Best Film. The Academy
will want to make a statement." I
also began to announce the results
of the upcoming New York City
mayoral race - four months too
early- based off nothing except my
own emotions.
This epiphany didn't hit me until
a couple of weeks later. A family
friend had gone to the emergency
room a few days before, but was
dismissed. The emergency room
doctor said it was just a virus and
that it would pass.
Well, it turns out that the doc-
tor was wrong and our family
friend had both pneumonia and a
virus the hospital couldn't identi-
fy. For two days, a resident tested

out different antibiotics on him,
hoping that one would work. His
parents were told that he might
not make it. A week later, he was
discharged from the hospital, but
significantly weaker.
I don't know if it could have gone
any differently. Still, I found myself
wondering if the resident could have
called on an older, more experienced
doctor instead of waiting and guess-
ing. Perhaps it would have saved my
friend and his family from this ter-
rifying experience.
I have to acknowledge
the limits of what I do
and don't know.
At the same time, it's certain
that I don't know what could have
or might have, but in the end, it
clicked: I have to acknowledge the
limits of what I do and don't know.
So, the next time someone men-
tions some intellectual-sounding
book I don't know, I won't nod
and smile like usual, and when
someone asks my opinion about
what's going on in Egypt, I'll admit
I haven't been followingthe news
too much. It may sound ignorant,
but hey, at least it's honest.

The summer, condensed
Wrapping up the last four months of University, city and state news
This summer was an especially busy one for the University,
Ann Arbor and the state of Michigan. Returning to school
can become quite stressful when you're unaware of the
recent changes to University policy and Michigan law. This edito-
rial will help fill you in on all of the changes you've missed over
the past four months, and what we'd like to see happen in the

A perfect politician?

near future.
This past July, the University's Board of
Regents voted to expand in-state tuition eli-
gibility to many of Michigan's undocumented
students, marking the end to a student-led
campaign for tuition equality. Beginning in
January 2014, undocumented residents in the
state may qualify for the lower resident tuition
prices, provided they can meet new residency
requirements. While this historic decision may
now make enrollment to the University pos-
sible for the state's undocumented population,
legal hurdles hinder the new policy's impact.
Undocumented students are currently ineli-
gible for state and federal financial aid. Con-
sidering the average undocumented family
earns $27,000 annually - roughly the cost of
attendance for one year at the University - the
broadening of in-state tuition is not enough.
If the University intends to promote a more
economically diverse campus, administration
must push state and federal officials to widen
financial-aid options - regardless of where
someone was born.
In August's primary election for Ann Arbor
City Council, both Ward 3 and 4 were up for
reelection. Incumbent Democrat Stephen
Kunselman was reelected in Ward 3, and Jack
Eaton beat out Marcia Higgins in Ward 4. Both
Kunselman and Eaton suggested that Ann
Arbor and the University should have a bet-
ter relationship with each other - a talking
point that's often brought up but rarely acted
upon. A break in this pattern is necessary come
November's election. For instance, Kunselman

said the University and the city need to work
together more efficiently in terms of security.
Better communication between the Univer-
sity Police and the city's law enforcement can
help prevent crime on campus. Even certain
improvements in the city, such as increased
street lighting, may promote both student
and resident safety. The council has a history
of seeing the University as a separate concern
from city matters; this year, we hope to see a
shift in this mindset.
Last Tuesday, the battle for Medicaid
expansion finally came to a close (for now) in
Michigan, with the state Senate reluctantly
approving the expansion, which is a criti-
cal mandate of the Affordable Care Act. Sup-
ported by Gov. Rick Snyder, the proposal will
add roughly more than 400,000 Michigan
residents to the low-income health insurance
plan. The expansion has been supported by
numerous organizations, including the Michi-
gan Health and Hospital Association and
the Small Business Association of Michigan.
These groups, like Snyder, have advocated the
positive fiscal impact ofexpandinghealth care.
Unfortunately, the conservative-dominated
state legislature's drawn-out debate over Med-
icaid was divided more on party lines rather
than the bill's flaws or merits. The ideological
divide nearly prevented Michigan's uninsured
from gaining coverage - an embarrassment
that even the Republican governor recognized.
The legislature should follow the governor's
example more often.

Ford to recall
370,000 cars
Ford is recalling 370,000
cars due to potential corrosion
to their steering shaft that may
result in loss of steering.
No incidents or injuries have,
been reported.
The cars include 2005 to 2011
Ford Crown Victoria, Mercury
Grand Marquis and Lincoln
Town Cars. About 355,000 are
in the U.S. and 15,000 in Canada.
Dealers will inspect the cars
and may replace the lower inter-

The agreement ends a month-
long blackout of CBS and CBS-
owned channels including
Showtime Networks, CBS Sports
Network and the Smithsonian
channel that affected more than
three million homes in Dallas, Los
Angeles and New York and began
Aug. 2.
The companies were in dispute

RIO DE JANEIRO
Brazil condemns
U.S. spy program
as 'unacceptable
invasion'
The Brazilian government
condemned a U.S. spy program
that reportedly targeted the
nation's leader, labeled it an
"unacceptable invasion" of sov-
ereignty and called Monday for
international regulations to pro-
tect citizens and governments
alike from cyber espionage.
In a sign that fallout over the
spy program is spreading, the
newspaper Folha de S.Paulo
reported that President Dilma
Rousseff is considering cancel-
ing her October trip to the U.S.,
where she has been scheduled to
be honored with a state dinner.
Folha cited unidentified Rous-
seff aides. The president's office
declined to comment.
The Foreign Ministry called in
U.S. Ambassador Thomas Shan-

non and told him Brazil expects
the White House to provide a
prompt written explanation over
the espionage allegations.
JOHANNESBURG
Mandela released
from hospital, will
receive home care
South Africans on Monday
welcomed Nelson Mandela's
discharge from a hospital after
nearly three months of treatment
amid concerns that his health
remains so poor that he still must
receive intensive care at home.
An ambulance returned the
95-year-old leader of the anti-
apartheid movement to his
home in the leafy Johannesburg
neighborhood of Houghton on
Sunday. The office of South Afri-
can President Jacob Zuma said
Mandela remains in critical and
sometimes unstable condition
and will receive the same level of
care that he did in the hospital,
administered by the same doc-
tors.

Daily wire reports

alert was sent out.
The student's name is being
withheld at her request and in
accordance with Daily policies
regarding survivors of sexual
assault.
The student questioned wheth-
er a crime alert should be sent out
because she was concerned about
the safety of the other members
of her apartment building.
"I'm wondering what has to be
deemed dangerous enough to get
an alert," she said.
According to the Clery Act, the
University is required to send out
crime alerts only when a crime,
considered to be a public safety
threat, occurs on campus. In the
past, UMPD has gone beyond its
jurisdiction and released alerts
about crimes that occurred near-
by and are considered threats to
public safety.
In order. to receive informa-
tion about crimes that occur off
campus, University Police said
they must establish relation-
ships with AAPD. Past incidents,
including the*delayed discovery
of repeated sexual assaults at a
Zaragon Place apartment, shed
light on communication, issues
between the University and the
city.
AAPD is not required to volun-
teer the information and, unlike
the University, does not employ a
full-time public information offi-
cer to coordinate with media and
make the public aware of dangers
to public safety.

MISCONDUCT
From Page 1A
ly begin an investigation during
the course of a private conversa-
tion.
SAPAC Director Holly Rider-
Milkovich said first-year students
are informed multiple times
about confidential and non-confi-
dential locations.
"Many times students have
trust relationships with people
who are in non-confidential
locations and chose to share
their information with them,"
Milkovch said. "And we want for
that to happen because we want
students to share their informa-
tion in a place where they feel safe
but we hope always that that is an
informed choice."
Once allegations are made, the
first step is to provide the survi-
vor with support services, like
a SAPAC advocate, per the new

policy. Next, the University pro-
vides an assessment to determine
if any temporary intervention is
needed, such as if the accuser and
the accused share classes or live
in the same residence hall.
Two employees in the Office
of Institutional Equity, which is
responsible for investigating civ-
il-rights abuses at the University,
have been assigned to investigate
all sexual misconduct allegations.
The policy also indicates that
no party has an obligation to
meet with the investigators, and
can choose not to cooperate with
an investigation. In cases when
the survivor does not want to
meet with investigators, a special
review panel will meet to deter-
mine if the investigation will con-
tinue.
The panel is charged finding a
balance between survivor choice
and campus safety, and the Title
IX coordinator having the final
say on the future of the investi-

gation. In many cases, because
of the nature of the sexual mis-
conduct, an investigation cannot
continue without the cooperation
of the survivor.
Title IX Coordinator Anthony
Walesby, associate vice pro-
vost and senior director of OIE,
explained that in a typical inves-
tigation, OIE staff meet sepa-
rately with the complainant and
accused.
"There's never'this back and
forth; no one's cross examining,"
Walesby said. "We ask questions.
We ask follow up questions based
on the information we have, but
you never have to worry about,
being in the same room as the
person you are accusing and vice
versa."
Law enforcement investiga-
tions and interviews are inde-
pendent of OIE activities, but
Walesby said UMPD and investi-
gators frequently share informa-
tion.

When determining guilt, OIE
investigators will use a lower
standard of proof. Known as
preponderance of the evidence,
the standard declares that guilt
is determined if there's enough
evidence to suggest a complaintis
more likelytrue than not.
The final report is then given
to the Office of Student Conflict
Resolutiorl, where consequences
can include probation, suspen-
sion and other sanctions. OSCR
also coordinates efforts to com-
munities affected by misconduct.
The differences between the
old policy and the interim policy
have already resulted in a signifi-
cant increase in the number of
sexual misconduct cases report-
ed to the University. During the
2010-2011 academic year, three
cases of sexual misconduct were
reported to the University, but in
2011-2012, there were 62 cases of
sexual misconduct investigated
under the interim policy.


CSG
From Page1A
ises - but these achievements
were not without struggles.
Graduate students sought
secession from CSG, claiming the
assembly did notfocus due efforts
toward their needs despite utiliz-
ing funds received from graduate
tuition. The student government
was forced to spend what Parikh
recalls as several hundred hours
seeking a resolution.
Like in Winter 2013, when
independent candidates Parikh

and Hashwi were faced with
the task of leading an opposi-
tion-dominated Representative
Assembly, Proppe and Dishell
will lead an assembly domi-,
nated by members of opposition
party forUM in the wake of elec-
tion disputes<\a> that led to the
disqualification of that party's
presidential candidate, who won
the popular vote. In May inter-
views, Proppe and LSA sopho-
more Pavitra Abraham, forUM's
party chair, both said they didn't
believe party politics would
interfere with the efficiency of
student government.

"All the representatives will
be working on their individual-
ized platforms and will be work-
ing with other members of the
Assembly to draft their resolu-
tions," Abraham said. "But they
will definitely be able to work
(with the executive) to accom-
plish all goals for the year."
During Tuesday's assem-
bly meeting the representa-
tives will discuss and vote on a
series of resolutions pertaining
to CSG rules and look back on a
resolution from the winter per-
taining to the increased price
of student football season tick-

ets. Additionally, Proppe and
Dishell will finalize and present
selected nominations to serve as
the chairs of the newly created
executive commissions and the
executive board to the Assembly.
"We're still in the process
of interviewing (candidates),"
Proppe said. "We were thrilled
with the number of applicants
we had; it's a great problem to
have, but it gets bogged down a
little bit in terms of processing all
of them."
The assembly meets every
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. on the third
floor of the Michigan Union.


HOUSING
From Page 1A
improving the quality of the resi-
dential experience and strength-
ening that connection between
living and learning," Logan said.
Most renovations added
enhanced study spaces as well
as community areas, two items
requested by students in early
surveys on housing.
On a larger scale, efforts were
made to connect students from
different dorms within particular
neighborhoods, Logan said. The
dining halls have played a role
in bringing different students
together by creating communal
dining locations - such as the
Hill Dining Center and The Blue
Apple at Bursley Residence Hall.
"Before the Residential Life
Initiative, so many of our halls
had individual dining places, and
while students with their meal
plans could still dine at other
locations, the tendency was to
dine where you live," Logan said.
Logan went on to say that hav-
ing fewer but larger dining halls
rather than one in each dorm is
cost-effective and helps create
the neighborhood atmosphere
the RLI project intends. New
entrances between South Quad
Residence Hall and West Quad
Residence Hall will also serve to
connect students between differ-
enthalls.
Though a main focus of RLI is
on student learning and interac-
tion, Logan emphasized that the
renovations were "not simply cos-
metic."
Construction focused primar-
ily on older heritage buildings,
while leaving major changes to
comparatively newer dorms, such
as the Mary Markley and Burs-
ley Residence Hall, for later. The
total project costs $750 million,
funded by 2-percent increases in
room and board every year since
renovations commenced, Logan
said.
There are no current plans to
renovations non-RLI dorms, like
Bursley and Markley.°
Gregory Wright, assistant
director of planning and design
for University Housing, said the
buildings included in the project
needed facility repairs and those
not included will likely need
them soon.
All residence halls received
upgrades to fire-alarm and sprin-
kler systems, and most dorms
also required upgrades in wire-
less Internet capability. Many of
the listed repairs in the RLI brief-
ing included mechanical, electri-
cal and plumbing overhauls inthe
outdated buildings.
"There was a lot of 'band-aid-
ing' going on over the years, and
that's why they reached a point
where they were putting Band-
Aids on Band-Aids," Wright said
of the plumbing system.
Wright explained that many of
the major issues came from try-
ing to include modern systems

in older buildings. Issues like
improper floor height to accom-
modate Internet and other wir-
ing, and inability to distribute
electricity and plumbing in taller
buildings, required improvised
solutions.
The building renovations have
also included updates in sustain-
ability. Most notably, all buildings
are now equipped with occupancy
sensors for the lights, and many
have low- or dual-flush toilets.
"I'm really excited about what
we've done and what we're still
doing," he said. "The transfor-
mation of these buildings is just
incredible."
Wright said the South and
West Quad renovations will take
a similar approach to the model
used for East Quad Residence
Hall.
The South Quad project will
not alter dorm rooms, but instead
focus primarily on lounges and
the dining hall. It is scheduled
to be completed by August 2014,
a tall order accordingto Wright.
"There's a lot packed into the
short amount of time that we
have," Wright said. "It's always
touch-and-go, but we've always
made it."
The University isn't the only
Big 10 institution improving
its residence facilities in recent
years:Thedininghallrenovations
and improvements are similar
to those undergone at Michigan
State University's Brody Neigh-
borhood in 2009.
The Brody dining hall, used
by the six residence halls in the
neighborhood, now includes a
two-story student lounge and
community spaces. The cafeteria,
named Brody Square, features
nine different eating venues. Five
of the residence halls themselves
have been renovated, and the
sixth is currently under construc-
tion.
An $83-million renovation to
Pennsylvania State University's
South Hall dormitories was also
completed this year. The dorm
rooms, lounges and community
spaces were all upgraded and
air conditioning was installed.
Unlike renovations here in Ann
Arbor, building exteriors were
also redesigned. A second phase

of renovations will be completed
at Penn State in 2015.
Indiana University has
upgraded and built several resi-
dence halls in recent years and
hopes to improve all of its resi-
dence halls by 2020.
LSA sophomore Samantha
Lyons never felt that her former
dorm, South Quad, was desper-
ate for repair, but after moving
to Stockwell Residence Hall this
year, she's is glad to see the dorm
updated.
"It's nice to try and keep up
with the other Big 10 schools and
other schools around the coun-
try," Lyons said.
When you ask a resident of the
renovated dorms about their liv-
ing situation, the word "hotel"
tends to come to mind.
LSA junior Iqra Nasir lived in
luxury last year in Couzens Resi-
dence Hall and said the dorm felt
extremely comfortable.
"The areas set up in Couzens
are wonderful," Nasir said.
"There' are lounges on every
floor, and it was really helpful to
have study areas so close to your
room."
Since the implementation
of RLI, the total dorm capac-
ity of the past several years has
been notably lower. After clos-
ing Baits I Residence Hall and
beginning renovations to East
Quad in 2011, housing priority
was reversed - freshmen were
given priority in dorm place-
ment.
Logan said givingthose rooms
to younger students helped ease
the transition into college life and
relieve the burden of trying to
find off-campus housing.
"That was not a popular deci-
sion," Logan said, noting the
frustration of the upperclassmen
who expected precedence in the
housing lottery. "What we're
anticipating is with our full com-
plement of rooms back in order of
Central Campus, we'll actually
have more choices for returning
students."
The dorm re-openings could
also mean fewer undergraduates
in Northwood Apartments I and
II, though the specifics on the
housing selection process have
not been finalized.

"I'm not sure what's stopping it or
how soon anymore progress can
be expected to be made."
Seiler said houses here on cam-
pus are in desperate need of reno-
vations.
"Greek life has been in exis-
tence at Michigan since 1845,
and less than half of the houses
have-sprinkler systems installed,
which is a major factor in safety

and fire prevention," she said.
"Because these houses have been
around so long, especially the
ones in the historic district, the
electrical wiring, plumbing and
other safety measures necessary
are very expensive to make."
Seiler said she believes more
people would be willing to sup-
port facility upgrades if their
donation could be classified as a
tax write-off.
The bill is currently pending in
the U.S. House Ways and Means
Committee.

Unapologetic
rapper shines on
major label debut
By JACKSON HOWARD
Daily Arts Writer
Juicy J makes it perfectly clear
what he is all about from the
start of Stay Trippy. "Stop It," the
opening track,
is a warning of B
sorts for poten-
tial listeners: If Stay Trippy
you don't like Juicy
money, drugs,
strippers or Columbia
murder, you
should turn this
album off. Quickly.
Though now in his late 30s
with two solo albums to his
name, Stay Trippy serves as
Juicy J's proper reintroduction
to a new generation. Founder
producer and longtime mem-
ber of the legendary southern
group Three 6 Mafia, Juicy has
managed to reinvent himself
in recent years as the mentally
unstable, drug using, strip-
club endorsing, simultaneously
hilarious and frightening hype
man to Wiz Khalifa.
On Stay Trippy, Juicy
attempts to strike the perfect
balance between his tradi-
tional southern roots with his
recently developed Khalifa-
sponsored identity. This is not
to say, however, that Juicy J or
any of the music he makes is by
any means complex. Instead,
Juicy has nearly perfected
his unique blend of "ratchet"
music, and though the lyrical
content can drop towards the
abysmal, there's no one you'd
rather bring to a house party.
The unexpected smash-hit
lead single, "Bandz A Make
Her Dance," featuring Lil
Wayne and 2 Chainz, is likely
the reason the label green lit
the album. The song, a menac-
ing ode to strippers complete
with a chanting chorus and
hand claps, is the new Juicy J
at his best, and finds him utter-
ing the mostcbluntly vulgar and
hysterical lines in years: "You
say no to ratchet pussy / Juicy
J can't."
There is a clear distinction,
then, between the somewhat
tailored-for-radio songs and
the classic Juicy J tracks. On
Stay Trippy, the former is found
on the "Bandz"-imitating
"Show Out" and "Bounce It," as
well as the two collaborations
with Wiz Khalifa, which sound
like passed-on leftovers from
Khalifa's last album.
The latter can be found
throughout Juicy's extensive
mixtape catalogue, which fea-
tured titles like Blue Dream ft
Lean. Tracks such as "So Much
Money," "Money A Do It," "All
I Blow Is Loud" and "IfI Ain't"
could've easily been plucked
off any of his past mixtapes,
as they share threatening,
drum-heavy beats filled with
violence, drugs and money. At
least one or two of these songs
should have been cut - the
album is 16 tracks long, and at
points the monotonous lyrics
and rhyme patterns make it
feel endless.
Nonetheless, there is a

The main flaw of Stay Trippy
is, for Juicy diehards, its great-
est attribute. Juicy J's songs, for
the most part, have no concep-
tual direction, no sense for lyrical
diversification or even an attempt
at breaking form. And that's OK.
Juicy is a guilty pleasure of sorts,
a certified entertainer who seems
to be somewhat aware of his
own absurdity but nonetheless
embraces it with everything he
has.
Stay Trippy is a step forward
for Juicy - it proves he's capable
of floating by himself on a major-
label album. Though lyrical pur-
ists might shudder to lines such
as "Bad bitch want me / Give
me head like lice," Juicy is doing
what only Juicy knows how to do.
And that's to stay astrippy as pos-
sible.'

Series of gang rape cases cause
fury, show signs of change in India

Germany tries elderly
man for Nazi war crimes

Recent trend led to
public outbursts
of anger
NEW DELHI (AP) - A series
of recent high-profile gang rape
cases inIndia has ignited a debate:
Are such crimes on the rise, or is
it simply that more attention is
being paid to a problem long hid-
den within families and villages?
The answer, experts say, is both.
Modernization is fueling a cri-
sis of sexual assault in India, with
increasingly independent women
now working in factories and
offices and stepping beyond the
subservient roles to which they
had traditionally been relegated.
They are also more likely than
their mothers and grandmothers
were to report rapes, and more
likely to encounter male strang-
ersin public.
"We never used to see so many
cases of gang rape, and so many
involving groups of young, unem-
ployed men," said Supreme Court

lawyer Kirti Singh, who special-
izes in women's issues.
While there are no reliable sta-
tistics on gang rapes, experts say
the trend, along with the grow-
ing sense of insecurity it has
brought for women, led to recent
outbursts of public anger over the
long-ignored epidemic of violence
against women.
The silence broke in Decem-
ber, when a New Delhi student
was gang-raped on a bus in a
particularly vicious attack from
which she died two weeks later.
A juvenile court on Saturday
handed down the first conviction
in the case, sending a teenager to
a reform home for three years for
rape and murder.
The sentence, the maximum
a juvenile can face, was widely
denounced as too lenient, and the
girl's parents vowed to appeal.
The other suspects in the case are
being tried as adults and could
face execution if convicted.
While attacks on women occur
constantly across India, often
within the home, the brutal-

ity and public nature of the New
Delhi case left many shocked and
shamed. Thousands took to the
streets in the capital to express
their outrage.
The government, pledging to
crack down, created fast-track
courts for rape cases, doubled
prison terms for rape and crimi-
nalized voyeurism, stalking,
acid attacks and the trafficking
of women.
The - Tourism Ministry
launched a nationwide "I
Respect Women" campaign
after a Swiss bicyclist was gang-
raped in March in central India
and an American woman was
gang-raped two months later
in the northern resort town of
Manali.
Yet another high-profile gang
rape last month, against a pho-
tojournalist on assignment in
Mumbai, renewed public fury
and sent the media into 24-7
coverage marked by daily front
page-headlines and talk shows
debating how to make India safe
for women.

92-year-old charged
with murder of
Dutchman
HAGEN, Germany (AP) --
Germany put a 92-year-old for-
mer member of the Nazi Waffen
SS on trial Monday on charges
that he killed a Dutch resistance
fighter in 1944.
Dutch-born Siert Bruins, who
is now German, entered the
Hagen state courtroom using a
walker, but appeared alert and
attentive as the proceedings
-opened.
No pleas are made in the Ger-
man system, and Bruins offered
no statement. His attorneyKlaus-
Peter Kniffka, said afterthe short
35-minute opening session that it
was unlikelyhis clientwould ever
address the court personally.
"I will probably deliver a
defense declaration, but it
depends upon the course of the

trial," he told reporters.
The trial comes amid a new
phase of German Nazi-era inves-
tigations, with federal pros-
ecutors this week expected
to announce they are recom-
mending the pursuit of possible
charges against about 40 former
Auschwitz guards.
The renewed probes of death
camp guards come after the case
of former Ohio autoworker John
Demjanjuk, who died last year
while appealing his 2011 convic-
tion for accessory to murder after
allegations he served in Sobibor.
His case established that death
camp guards could be convicted
as accessories to murder, even if
there was no specific evidence of
atrocities againstthem.
Bruins, however, had long
been on the radar of German
legal authorities and already
served time in the 1980s for his
role in the wartime slaying of
two Dutch Jews.
Bruins was also already con-

victed and sentenced to death in
absentia in the Netherlands in
1949 in a case that involved the
killing of the resistance'fighter.
The sentence was later commut-
ed to life in prison, but attempts
to extradite him were unsuccess-
ful because he had obtained Ger-
man citizenship through a policy
instituted by Adolf Hitler to con-
fer citizenship on foreigners who
served the Nazi military.
Ulrich Sander, spokesman for
an organization representing the
victims of Nazi crimes, told the
dpa news agency that the deci-
sion to bring Bruins to trial again,
even at his advanced age, was a
good one.
"We must make it clear for
the future that such crimes are
always prosecuted, that murder-
ers never get away," he said.
Despite his age, Bruins was
found medically fit to stand trial,
though Kniffka said the stress of
the proceedings against him has
weakened him.

READY FOR THE LIGHTS

MICHIGAN VS. CENTRAL
e.59 9

Five things we learned CMU

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
It was Central Michigan. This wasn't
Notre Dame, or a Big Ten opponent. What
we learned about this Michigan football
team on Saturday in its first game of the year
might not hold true once conference play
starts, or even when the Fighting Irish come
into town this weekend.
Still, there are some takeaways from
Michigan's 59-9 drubbing ofthe Chippewas.
Just don't be surprised if Devin Gardner
looks more like Chad Henne than Denard
Robinson next week.
It's the Five Things We Learned, Week 1
edition:
1. Gardner's offense isn't dramatically
different from Robinson's.
After spending an entire summer hearing
about a new, traditional pro-style offense,
Michigan's first two drives had Gardner take

snaps entirely from the shotgun formation.
By the end of the day, Gardner ran seven
times for 52 yards and two touchdowns.
Only one of them was a designed run.
This offense wasn't anunder-center, run-
the-ball-down-your-throat classic. It had a
reverse, plenty of different formations, and a
quarterback that could break free for a long
run even when every avenue was seemingly
shut down.
This offense was the norm when Robin-
son was still in Ann Arbor. It was supposed
to be different this year, but in the end, it
wasn't all that different.
Yet, Gardner's scrambles still look dif-
ferent than Robinson's - more controlled
and fluid and less like a mad dash. Gard-
ner's decision making is going to be tested
every weekend, where tucking the ball and
pirouetting through the defense isn't going
to be as easy. Gardner's two interceptions.
on Saturday weren't pretty - one was well
overthrown and one was a poor read in the
opponent's red zone. Notre Dame is goingto

punish those mistakes a lot more than Cen-
tral Michigan did.
One thing is for sure - this offense isn't
going to be traditional. There will still be a
quarterback running the ball this season,
even if he's bigger and doesn't have dread-
locks.
2. Extra pounds or not, Derrick Green
will be a factor.
The No. 1 running back recruit in the
nation showed up to training camp 'more
than a few pounds overweight, to the point
where Michigan coach Brady Hoke had him
listed in a positional battle for the fifth run-
ning back spot on the first depth chart of the
year alongside fellow freshman De'Veon
Smith.
Green entered the game in the third quar-
ter, when the game was already well out of
reach, but still looked impressive. He fin-
ished with 58 yards on 11 carries and scored

In rivalry week, players avoid distractions

By LIZ VUKELICH
paily Sports Editor
There's always a little more hype sur-
rounding rivalry weeks, because, well, that's
the point.
And with the Michigan-Notre Dame
rivalry taking a hiatus after next season, it's
only fitting that the game this year will be
even bigger than usual.
The stage is traditionally big - over
114,00 fans flocked to Michigan Stadium to
see the first night game two years ago.
It was made even bigger on Saturday,
when ESPN announced that College Foot-
ball GameDay would air out of Ann Arbor.
This will be the 11th time in history that
GameDay is set on Michigan's campus, the
most recent of which was for the last Under

The Lights game against the Fighting Irish.
But while fans will likely do their best to
rise early on Saturday and carry the wittiest
sign in hopes of nabbing an on-air cameo,
there's at least one person on campus that
isn't impressed by any of the hoopla.
"I think in the past, people try to make all
of this a huge deal, (but) it's not for us, it's'
for the students," said fifth-year senior left
tackle Taylor Lewan. "For us, we're playing
a game on Saturday, representing 134 years
of Michigan football. I'm representing them
when I step on the field. I don't need to focus
on College Gameday being here."
For some, like Lewan, it's easier to push
all the distractions aside. Redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner - who only has
classes on Monday - laughed abouthow the
Labor Day holiday meant he had no classes

at all this week. Now he has five whole days
to do nothing but study for and think about
the game.
But for others who maybe don't have as
much rivalry-game experience, Notre Dame
week is a completely different beast.
Eleven true freshmen saw playing time
last weekend against Central Michigan.
Though Michigan coach Brady Hoke sd
he was pleased that so many new players got
the experience of playing in front of 112,000
screaming fans, the fear that the youngsters
could get carried away by distractions still
lingers.
"We try to educate (the younger players),
what it's going to be like," Hoke said. "Start-
ed that (on Sunday). Tuesday, we'll. talk
more about the atmosphere and have some

SportsTuesday: What Brian Kelly doesn't know

ere's what Brian Kelly
knows but won't say:
he can't decide what
is a rivalry and what isn't. Jack
Swarbrick can't decide what is
a rivalry and
what isn't.
He's not
insane. What
Brian Kelly
knows but
won't say
is that by
questioning a
rivalry, he'll ZACH
rile up his HELFAND
fan base and
save face for
his boss.
Kelly knew all this on Sunday
when he said of the Michigan-
Notre Dame series: "I really
haven't seen it as one of those
historic, traditional Notre Dame
rivalries. I've seen it as just one
of those great football games
that Notre Dame has played."
Michigan spent much of Mon-
day insisting that, for them, this
game is a rivalry.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
dropped the phrase "great rival-
ry game" twice in a row before
even being asked a question at
his afternoon press conference.
Then reporters asked him and
his players about it for the rest of
the press conference.
But arguing that the series is a
rivalry is a waste of time because
the answer is so glaringly obvi-
ous. And Brian Kelly knows this.
Brian Kelly coached in the
state of Michigan from 1987 to
2006, so he surely knows about
the 1994 game. He knows it was
televised in more than 100 coun-
tries, "including Zimbabwe,"
The Michigan Daily reported at
the time.
After Michigan won, Rachel
Bachman reported, students

swelled onto South Forest and
into East University. "There

important, because when we're
exhausted from classes or when
our country isset to bomb

having a bad week, we need a
place where everyone can get
together and drink and yell and
hug and cry.
We want moments when the
leaves smell sweeter, and the
skies seem brighter and no one
cares they're missing dinner-
time.
These moments have come
when Michigan plays Notre

Dame. Moments like two years
ago. The students stayed in the
stadium for 45 minutes after the
game ended.
Denard Robinson, his voice
cracking, marveled at the stu-
dent section.
"The game is over!" he said,
but still they stayed until, finally,
they spilled out into the streets.
No one cared it was 4 a.m. as
they partied on the lawns and in
the streets, and no one cared if
this game was a rivalry or not.
If Michigan wins another game

like that on Saturday, they'll do it
again, and they won't bother ask-
ing themselves if Michigan plays
Notre Dame enough to warrant
it. They'll just know.
Does that mean this is a rival-
ry? It doesn't matter. Brian Kelly
knows that, and he probably
knows, too, that whatever he
calls it, it's worth playing every
single year.

General Admission: Take one
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Online Editor

It started with a trickle.
At 7:20 a.m., there were 16. At
9:20 a.m. there were 41. Around
100 by 11 a.m. All standing or sit-
ting, talking or napping, play-
ing cards or watching ESPN on
an 18-foot TV in a line of mostly
empty gated spaces. All waiting to
enter the Big House and be in the
front rows for the Michigan foot-
ball season opener against Central
Michigan.
For the first game of general-
admission student tickets in Mich-
igan football history, no one knew
what to expect. Was it the end
of Football Saturday pregames?
Would students not buy tickets?
Would hundreds camp out over-
night like they did when President
Barack Obama came to speak?
The Athletic Department over-
estimated the number of students
who would show up very early.
The gates were too long, the pri-
vate security guards were too
many - 20 as of 7 a.m. - and too
much free Pizza House pizza was
given out to the small group of
waiting students.
A private security guard said he
thought there would be more peo-
ple. "It's 10 o'clock, man," he said.
"Where is everyone?"
Very few students arrived
before noon. But soon, they start-
ed comingin droves.
The four chutes labeled H, O, K
and E were opened at 11:45 a.m.,
and the stadium student gates
were opened at 12:35 p.m. Students
were given a wristband (complete
with a bank advertisement) to be
granted access to the first 22 rows.
Once those rows were filled,
the newly arriving students were
given a general-admission ticket.
The growing crowd was easy-
going and no one seemed drunk -
very different than the lower bowl
at games in prior years. Radio-
friendly songs were played, some
students danced on their seats
and simple contests were held:
a tricycle race across the field, a
guess the Michigan legend on the
billboard and a field-goal contest
for an iPad. Simple things kept the
crowd from going crazy during
the wait.

Some of the students who waited in the general admission line for good seats get some company after Saturday's win.

As of 1:20 p.m., only the first
14 rows of student seating were
filled, so superb seats were still
up for grabs. The first rows were
filled with a younger crowd - lots
of freshmen and sophomores - in
a space previously held by upper-
classmen.
An hour before kickoff, the
student bowl was more than half
full. The general-admission policy
seemed to be a success. They had
convinced students to show up
to a game not only before kickoff,
but an entire hour before. The few
students at 7 a.m. had turned into
a horde of fans by 2:30 p.m.
Athletic Department Chief
Marketing Officer Hunter Loch-
mann said Saturday morning that

one reason for general admission
was to "create an atmosphere" for
coach Brady Hoke by kickoff. That
had certainly been accomplished.
After the game, Hoke men-
tioned how cool it was to have the
section full during warmups and
how much he appreciated that
from the students.
However, everything wasn't
perfect.
The normally packed or beyond
capacity lower bowl was filled but
not crazily so. From a faraway
camera, it looked complete, but
on the ground there were empty
seats and everyone had plenty of
room - certainly not the norm in
previous games.
The traditional hierarchy of

seniors in the front, freshman
at the back has been destroyed.
Classes were mixed together and
some traditions were certainly
lacking in the front rows: students
were not thrown up in the air
after a Michigan score. This only
occurred in the back.
Traditions will still get passed
downfrom class to class,but it will
be more complicated.
About an hour before kickoff a
group of younger students tried to
start a wave. Other students start-
ed to join the effort, even though
the non-student sections of the
stadium were not filled.
An older student yelled, "The
wave is for the third quarter."
The others stopped.

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
Earlier this week, defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison said
that his defensive line could
rotate three deep, even if that
means constantly swapping
players. Some would play more
than others, but Mattison had
enough faith in the second and
third string players to consider
them a part of the regular rota-
tion.
On Saturday, we saw what
Mattison has been seeing all off-
season - a deep, talented group
strong enough to comfortably
rotate more than ten players on
the line even though it's a group
without much experience.
In Michigan's 59-9 drubbing
of Central Michigan, the defense
registered four sacks, two of
them by the defensive line. The
Wolverines posted four sacks in
a game just once all of last sea-
son, when the defensive line con-
tributed just 12 sacks all year.
"(The defensive line) had a
lot of energy," said junior line-
backer Desmond Morgan. "They
were flying around. Stunts came
a little bit cleaner and guys com-
municated a little bit better.
It's something we kind of pride
ourselves on, having depth and
rotating guys in as much as pos-
sible."
The Wolverines were at it
from the get-go, rotating differ-
ent defensive lineman in on just
the second play of the game. The
game officially became a blowout
in the second half, but even while
the game was still close, the rota-
tion never stopped.
Veterans like fifth-year senior
Quinton Washington played.
Rookies like redshirt freshman
Willie Henry played. There
were budding stars like junior
Frank Clark and lesser knowns
like junior Brennan Beyer, who
got the first sack of his career
against Central Michigan.
(Beyer switched to linebacker
from defensive end, but played
on the line at times Saturday.)
Mattison had them all in

or redshirt freshmen played on
Saturday. They made an impact
from the get-go, when Dymonte
Thomas blocked Central Michi-
gan's first punt attempt and
fifth-year senior Joe Reynolds
returned it for the first touch-
down of the game. Channing
Stribling had the second-most
tackles on the team, while
Smith and Green split 10 carries
on a 55-yard touchdown drive in
the third quarter.
Hoke also got backup quar-
terback Shane Morris some
much-needed game reps. Mor-
ris had a tipped interception in
the third quarter that was inch-
es away from being a fantastic
pass to fellow freshman tight
end Jake Butt.
That pass, like the rest of
these young players, will come
with time.
4. The depth is there.
Michigan's defense was miss-
ing three of its starters and
the unit still only allowed nine

points. Again, it was Central
Michigan, but it's still a good
sign.
Next week, fifth-year strong
safety Thomas Gordon is back
from a suspension, but senior
free safety Courtney Avery will
miss another week or two, and
captain Jake Ryan is out until
mid-October.
And yet, some of their
replacements were key players
on Saturday. Fifth-year senior
Cam Gordon had two sacks in
place of Ryan, while redshirt
junior Josh Furman and sopho-
more Jarrod Wilson did a solid
job from the safety spots.
The defensive line rotated
more than 10 players through-
out the game, confirming
defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison's idea that he could
go three-deep on the defensive
line. Many of the defensive line-
men are inexperienced, but it's
still a talented group that will
consistently rotate enough guys
to stay fresh.
This team's depth is inexpe-

rienced but talented, and could NOTRE DAME
be a big factor late in the season. From Page 1B

5. Bold Prediction: Den-
nis Norfleet is going to win a
game for Michigan this year.
Man, he's fast, and man, can
he read the field. In the first
quarter, the sophomore wide
receiver/kick returner took a
reverse handoff on a 38-yard
gallop, and late in the game, he
had a long punt return that was
called back because of a block-
in-the-back penalty.
It still doesn't seem that
Michigan is entirely certain
how to use Norfleet yet. He
caught two passes along with
his reverse and came close to
breaking a kick return on more
than one occasion.
He might not be a factor in
every game, but he's too quick to
not turn a game at one point this
season. It might not be against
Notre Dame, but before the sea-
son ends, a game will belong to
Dennis Norfleet.

of the older kids talk about what
that atmosphere will be like."
But many of these true fresh-
men will take on a minor role.
Redshirt sophomore cornerback
Blake Countess recalled how
during the Under the Lights
game his freshman year, his
principal job was to act as a sup-
portsystemfortheolder players.
In the meantime, Hoke is
using every resource at his fin-
gertips to try and keep a sense
ofnormalcythis week while still
promoting the importance of
the rivalry.
"With technology today,
you can show (the freshmen
the atmosphere)," Hoke said.
"Then you talk about not being
distracted. Taking care of your
job, being accountable to the
teammates thatyou have on this
team."
NOTE: Redshirt freshman
running back Drake Johnson is
out for the remainder of the sea-
son with a torn anterior cruciate
ligament sustained during the
Central Michigan game. This
makes him the third player since
the spring to suffer from an ACL
injury.
Saturday was Johnson's first
career game for the Wolver-
ines. He had two carries for nine
yards and one tackle on special
teams.
"You just hate it for Drake, but
he's as tough as anyone on this
football team, and he will make
it back from this," Hoke said in
a statement. "He worked so hard
through his redshirt season and
had a really good camp in back-
ing up Fitz (Toussaint), not to
mention he was areallyvaluable
special teams player for us."
According to Hoke, John-
son was injured trying to make
a tackle but was pushed from
behind. He also said that the
strength staff and the trainers
would take a look at preventa-
tive measures to protect the
team from more ACL injuries.

Sophomore wide receiver Dennis Norfleet has the speed and athletiCism to win a game for Michigan.

Michigan grinds out
draw at Bowling Green

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
The Chaka Daley era of Michi-
gan soccer continues to produce
positive results.
The Michigan men's soccer
team traveled to Bowling Green
on Monday in hopes of avenging
last year's 2-0 loss in Ann Arbor,
but the Wolverines were forced to
settle for a 1-1 draw after the Fal-
cons found a late equalizer in the
82nd minute.
Senior midfielder Fabio Pereira
netted his first goal of the season
off a 25-yard strike in the 41st
minute, giving Michigan the half-
time advantage. A rebound from
sophomore forward James Mur-
phy trickled back to Pereira, who
struck the ball into the top corner.
"We got a little bit of a rhythm
there at the end of the second half,
and it resulted in a great goal by
Fabio," Daley said. "It was a grind
the rest of the game."
But just as Michigan (1-0-1)
crept ahead, a red card issued to
redshirt junior forward Tyler
Arnone neutralized its positive
first half. A foul-laden prelude to
Arnone's infraction may very well
have been at fault for a question-
able ejection. Multiple Wolver-
ines expressed the feeling that
the head official lost control of the
game early on.
Down a man for 70 minutes,
the Wolverines were still able to
stymie Bowling Green (1-0-1) for
a majority of the match, a credit
to Michigan's back line. Daley
commented on senior defender
Ezekiel Harris's invaluable lead-
ership and the growth of fresh-
man defender Andre Morris as
clear positives to take from this
result.
"This is the battle these guys

Bartelstein pens e-book on Final Four run

I

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
Following his graduation from
Michigan, former basketball cap-
tain Josh Bartelstein compiled the
80 blogs he wrote over the past
three years into his own personal
book - a makeshift diary journal-
ing his experiences and the pro-
gression of the program.
For months, that's where the
story of the 'Bartelstein Blog' was
supposed to end - on Bartelstein's
coffee table.
But thanks to a chance encoun-
ter between former Wolverine
Zack Novak and entrepreneur
Zack Price, the founder of Blog
Into Book and a Michigan alum,
Bartelstein's blogs, along with a

host of interactivecontent, will be
available to Michigan fans nation-
wide.
'We On: Behind the Scenes of
Michigan's Final Four Run' is set
for an electronic release on Tues-
day. For $7.99, fans can purchase
the e-book on iTunes, Amazon,
Kindle or from www.BlogInto-
Book.com.
Bartelstein, who is currently
working for a real estate firm in
Chicago while doing speaking
engagements about creating win-
ning atmospheres, can't help but
laugh at how far along the blog
has come since he was first asked
to write it prior to his sophomore
season.
"It's really surreal to me," Bar-
telstein said last week. "Never in a

million years did I think it would
get to this point where it's going to
be a book."
The book begins with an intro-
duction from Bartelstein, followed
by a forward from Novak, who
recounts his pivotal role in con-
structing the program from the
ground up. It includes details of
the various meetings he had with
Michigan coach John Beilein and
how and why certain program-
related decisions were made.
Passages written by three of his
former teammates - Trey Burke,
Tim Hardaway Jr. and Stu Doug-
lass - come next, before the book
jumps into its central focus: the
2013-14 Final Four season. Each
blog from the year is included
chronologically, interspersed with
new insights from Bartelstein.
But the section Bartelstein calls
the "best part" covers the Final
Four. This section is centered
around a 14-page insert, breaking
the week down "minute by minute
of what happened every day." The
coverage is comprehensive, from
every perspective. Fans will not
only see behind-the-scenes videos
and pictures from the players' and
coaches' vantage points, but from
the eyes of fans in both Atlanta
and Ann Arbor.
"The biggest thing we miss as
players, or even coaches, is we
don't get to experience what the
fans are like during the games,"
Bartelstein said. "We don't get to
see inside the Brown Jug or in the
Diag when we beat these teams,
so to have the videos of (students)
dancing or at the bars - it gives
you any perspective. So while I
give you the perspective of what
we were doing orthe coacheswere
doing, you also get videos of what
the fans were doing during the
games. So if you weren't in Atlanta
or weren't in Dallas, you'll see it
from every angle.
"When you see those things,
you can kind of put yourself back
in the moment. It really gives you
the chills."
Following the Final Four, the
book transitions back into the
beginnings of Bartelstein's blog-
writing career, which began with
the 2010-11 campaign, when a
young, upstart Wolverine squad,
picked by some to finish last in the

the NCAA Tournament.
Bartelstein, who said he
wouldn't typically describe him-
self as nostalgic, repeatedly found
himself in awe at the transforma-
tion the program underwent dur-
ing his tenure.
"The coolest thing for me is
going back and reading it and see-
ing how far that we've come," he
said. "My favorite part will always
be seeing how much progress this

program has made.
"It was an amazing stretch of
how quickly it happened and even
crazier to see page by page."
A few months ago, Bartelstein
felt lucky just to have so many
memories bound together in one
place. Now, he's gotten the chance
to dive so much deeper into the
tournament run of his life, while
in the process, experiencing an
entirely different angle. And for
a player that built his reputation

around sharing his inside per-
spective of the basketball program
with the Wolverine fanbase, he's
happyto share one final time.
"It's just everything you could
ever want to not just remember
this year, but remember this pro-

recently," Bartelstein said. "There
are not many books thatcan really
capture a program, written by

Michigan sweep gives Rosen 500th win

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
The No. 7 Michigan volleyball
team picked up where it left off
last year in its first weekend back
on the court, winning its first
three games. The weekend culmi-
nated with Michigan coach mark
Rosen earning his 500th career
win.
"One of the coolest things is
that it's about those people that
won those matches, because I
didn't win any of those matches
from the standpoint of playing,"
Rosen said.* "We've had a great
group of people throughout my
career, but certainly throughout
our time here at Michigan."
The seventh-ranked Wolver-
ines opened their season at the
three-game tournament at the
Xavier Invitational in Cincinnati.
They faced off against Clemson
and Xavier on Friday and North-
ern Kentucky on Saturday - and
Michigan swept the competition
without dropping a set.
A dominant win over the Norse
on Saturday gave Rosen his 500th
career win as well as an invita-
tional title for the Wolverines.
Rosen is the fourth active Big Ten
coach withA00 career wins. In his,
15th season with Michigan, Rosen
boasts a record of 291-177 and last
season he led the program to its
first Final Four appearance.
 Rosen's players continued last
season's success on Saturday,
where the Wolverines opened the
first set against Northern Ken-
tucky (0-3) hitting .342. A 7-1 run
ultimately led them to winning
25-19 win in the first set. Ulti-
mately, senior outside hitter Lexi
Erwin paced Michigan (3-0) with
16 kills, while fellow-senior out-
side hitter Molly Toon added 11
kills and six digs.
The Wolverines finished the
match hitting .343 and committed
just 11 errors. Junior setter Lexi
Dannemiller earned the MVP
award and senior middle blocker
Jennifer Cross joined Dannemi-
SHer as a selection for the All-Tour-

blocks and acouple kills and really
impacted the game very quickly
and significantly and she contin-
ued that the first two matches."
Only one of the other freshmen
- middle blocker Gabbie Bulic -
saw playing time on Saturday. She
contributed in the third game,
registering nine kills and a .529
hitting percentage.
"Gabbie played today and she
did a really nice job and worked
evenly into the college game,"
Rosen said. "There are still some
things she's a little behind on, but
offensively (she) did a great job
and really did a nice job of getting
better as the match went on."
The Wolverines continued to
look like a top-10 squad against
Xavier (2-1), winning the first
set 25-18 while hitting .571. The
Mountaineers opened the second
set on a 6-1 run before Michigan
climbed back to take the set25-22.
The Wolverines went on to win
the match in straight sets for the
second game ina row, completing
the perfect first day of play.
Against Xavier, Dannemi-
ller led Michigan with 37 assists
and eight digs, while sophomore
defensive specialist Tiffany
Morales added a team-high 12
digs. Leading the offense were
senior captains Erwin and Cross,
who had 11 and 10 kills, respec-
tively.
"I think we're fearless,"
Dannemiller said. "There wasn't
a moment in time in the last two
matches that we ever doubted
ourselves or got down on our-
selves. We just looked really fear-
less."
Next up for the Wolverines is
the Big Ten/Pac-12 Challenge,
where they will face Oregon State
on September 6 and Oregon on
September 7 in Cliff Keen Arena
for their home opener.
"I'm excited," Dannemiller
said. "I think we have a great sea-
son ahead of us and we proved it
after these last few matches. Just
being able to play someone else for
a change and see the success, it's
just really exciting."

nament Team.
"Jen was great," Rosen said.
"She played very consistent,
dominating as an attacker and as
a blocker. And Dannemiller was
running the offense as well as
anyone's ever run it here. She'sjust
doing a great job. It's really fun to
watch her become such a mature
player now that she has two years
of college under her belt."
And just like they ended it, the
Wolverines started the weekend
on fire beating Clemson (1-2) in
straight sets and hitting .476 in

the match's first set. Sophomore
middle blocker Krystalyn Goode
had acareer-high eightblocks and
added four kills.
"I thought all of our returners
did a really nice'job this week-
end," Rosen said. "We really made
some changes in our lineup today
to give our younger players some
experience and I really wanted
our older players to carry a big
load to help that process and they
did really well."
. Overall, Michigan opened the
tournament in dominant fashion,

hitting .315, while holding the
Tigers to a meager -.033.
Michigan has now won its sea-
son opener for the eighth straight
season. Dannemiller led the Wol-
verines with 35 kills, five digs
and two blocks in the first game
against Clemson. Meanwhile,
freshman middle blocker Abby
Cole registered nine kills in her
first college appearance.
Cole, the top recruit for the
Wolverinesthis season, is expect-
ed to contribute immediately and
help fill the void of Claire McEI-

heny. The freshman also played
in the second game against Xavier
but did not see action in the third
game because of a lingering knee
problem that the team wants to
monitor.
"Abby looked great," Dannemi-
ller said. "She didn't seem scared
at all, she just wanted to go out
and kill the team and she handled
it really well, a lot better than I
expected."
Added Rosen: "Abby Cole on

of her career she had two or three

Coleman announces July 2014 retirement

University President Mary Sue Coleman applauds at Thursday's meeting of the Board of Regents.

Search for next
president begins
during summer
By PETER SHAHIN, SAM
GRINGLAS and
JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily News Editor
and Daily StaffReporters
APRIL 18, 2013 - At the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents meeting
Thursday, University President
Mary Sue Coleman announced
her intention to retire after her
term expires in July 2014 without
seeking a contract extension.
"Leading the University of
Michigan is the most challenging
and rewarding work of my career.
It's a tremendous privilege and
one that continuously energizes
me," she said at the meeting.
Coleman began her tenure as
the University's 13th president in
August 2002, succeeding Lee Bol-
linger, now president of Columbia
University. Her successor will be
chosen by the Board of Regents,
which has already been preparing
for her long-expected retirement.

Coleman is the fourth-longest
servingpresident in the history of
the University, and the first presi-
dent to serve more than a decade
since Robben Fleming's regular
appointment ended in 1979.
After receiving her under-
graduate degree in chemistry
from Grinnell College in Iowa,
she received a doctorate in bio-
chemistry from the Univer-
sity of North Carolina. Coleman
served as the director of a cancer
research center at the University
of Kentucky for 20 years before
serving as president of the Uni-
versity of Iowa for seven years.
"The University of Michigan
deserves the best in a leader,
and I want to give the Board of
Regents ample time to select the
next president," Coleman said in
a statement.
In an interview after the meet-
ing, Coleman said she has no plans
to decelerate her busy schedule
during the remaining 15 months
on the job. She will continue to
engage other donors throughout
the alumni community.
"I love to listen and I have this
great group of people around me
that helped me create the vision

and I really try to translate the
vision and help people under-
stand when they've given a big
gift, it will be the happiest day of
(their) lives," Coleman said.
In addition, Coleman said she
willfocusoncompletingotherren-
ovations and implementing a stra-
tegic plan for health-care changes.
"We just have a lot of work to
do, and I'm going to be excited by
that work and not slowed down
for a second," Coleman said.
University ProvostPhil Hanlon
praised Coleman's efforts during
her tenure at the University - cit-
ing her work to improve academic
quality, increase international
reputation and recognition, grow
the application pool, reduce costs
for students with need and over-
see the most successful capital
campaign in University history as
evidence of leaving a legacy with
the University.
"It's just really amazing what
she's done just as a friend and
a mentor," Hanlon said. "I've
learned so much from her. She's
been a terrific leader."
Regent Andrea Fischer
Newman (R) echoed Hanlon's
positive statements, praising

Coleman's ability to keep the
University thriving and prosper-
ous during harsh economic times
with decreased state appropria-
tion and federal support.
"This University is doing phe-
nomenally under her leadership,"
Newman said. "This is a huge, huge
loss,youknow, but it's her decision."
Her tenure at the University
has faced a number of challenges
- foremost building a new bud-
get model in the face of declining
state revenues. State support for
the University of Michigan has
declined from around 35 percent
of the University's budgetin 2002
to less than 17 percent this year.
Coleman also was forced to con-
front the University of Michigan
Health System's six-month delay
in reporting a medical resident's
possession of child pornography
to University Police and a scandal
in which former basketball team
booster Ed Martin admitted to
running an illegal gambling oper-
ation from which he laundered
money to members of the Michi-
gan men's basketball team.
In a presentation to the
regents, Martha Pollack, vice
provost for academic and bud-
getary affairs, said tuition has
increasedby more than 5 percent
per year over the last decade in
order to help make up for losses
in state appropriations.
At the same time, the Univer-
sity has also made substantial
contributions to centrally allo-
cated financial aid to help offset
costs for disadvantaged students.
Early in her presidency, Cole-
man also championed the Uni-
versity's defense of race-based
affirmative action admissions
policies before the U.S. Supreme
Court. In two separate rulings,
the court decided that the Uni-
versity could use a "holistic"
review process, meaning each
candidate would be judged by
the individual contributions they
might make to the overall cam-
pus environment.
Despite a very public campaign
by Coleman, Michigan voters
adopted Proposal 2in2006, which
outlawed the use of race-based
admissions in higher education.
She has maintained her stance on
affirmative action and spoken out
on more recent rulings on the con-
troversial policy aswell.

Coleman also spearheaded
the University's largest capital
campaign, The Michigan Differ-
ence, which ended in 2008 and
raised $3.2 billion. The campaign
helped finance renovations to or
construction of a number of cam-
pus buildings, including the Pub-
lic Policy School's Weill Hall, the
C.S. Mott Children's Hospital,
and the Ross School of Business.
The University is set to launch
its next capital campaign this
fall. The total goal has not yet
been set,but accordingto atweet
sent by Regent Mark Bernstein
during his Twitter Town Hall on
Wednesday, the campaign will
aim to raise at least $1 billion for
financial aid.
Besides the projects funded
through the capital campaign,
Coleman has shepherded the Res-
idence Life Initiative to renovate
a number of University Housing
facilities. Since 2002, Alice Lloyd,
Mosher-Jordan and others have
been renovated in the first phase
of the program. Construction of
North Quad Residence Hall was
completed in 2010 and South
Quad and West Quad Residence
Halls are slated for renovations in
the next two years.
As the presidentof the Univer-
sity, Coleman has also traveled to
a number of countries to estab-
lish partnerships and engage
with alumni and educational
leaders around the world. In her
official capacity, she will have
traveled to China, South Africa,
the United Arab Emirates, Bra-
zil, Israel and Ghana. She will
take her final official trip abroad
to India in November. ,
While Coleman was chair
of the Association of American
Universities for one year - from
October 2011 to October 2012 -
she served as spokesperson for
the association.
Primarily focusing on research,
Coleman represented AAU in
meetings with national policy-
makers to discuss issues related to
research and graduate, profession-
al and undergraduate education.
After AAU appointed her, Cole-
man said she hoped to represent
the University's work in research
well in her future meetings.
"The contributions and dis-
coveries of research universi-
ties are integral to the forward

momentum of our country,"
Coleman said. "I look forward
to giving voice to our important
work in the upcoming year."
AAU - a nonprofit association
of 62 U.S. and two Canadian pub-
lic and private research universi-
ties - focuses on developing and
implementing better national and
institutional policies related to
research and scholarship,graduate
and professional education, under-
graduate education and public ser-
vice in research universities.
Coleman has also been on the
board of directors of Johnson &
Johnson, a pharmaceutical company
based inNew Jersey,since2003.
As stated on the company's
website, "Having served as presi-
dent of two of the nation's largest
and most prestigious public uni-
versities and having a long and
decorated career in the sciences,
Dr. Coleman brings to the Compa-
ny's Board a unique point of view
regarding organizational man-
agement and academic research
vital to a company competing in
science-based industries."
In 2010, The New York Times
questioned potential conflicts of
interest pertaining to Coleman's
position on the board. Soon after,
the University Medical School
became the first in the country
to refuse drug company funding
in medical education class, citing
the need to eliminate any biases.
Coleman said in a statement
that she intends to remain active
in advocating for higher educa-
tion, scientific research support,
and diversity at the national
level. As part of this involve-
ment, Coleman will serve on the
Board of Directors for the Soci-
ety for Science and the Public
and on the Advisory Committee
to the Director of the National
Institutes of Health.
Coleman also plans to remain
inAnn Arbor.
"We have always lived in col-
lege towns and there's really no
place like Ann Arbor. We did
not think twice about where we
wanted to call home after the
presidency," she said.
While Coleman and her hus-
band have purchased a home in
Ann Arbor, they will split their
time between Michigan and Colo-
rado, where their son and his fam-
ily reside.

TUITION
Coalition rallies
at campus hub A

Students gather in
support of tuition
equality
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
SEPT. 19, 2012 - Seats
reserved for University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman and
University Provost Philip Han-
lon may have remained notice-
ably empty during Tuesday's
rally for tuition equality on
the Diag, but that didn't stop
students invested in the cause
from demanding that top
administrators take steps to
ease restrictions on undocu-
mented students.
About 100 students gath-
ered at the steps of the Hatcher
Graduate Library where the
Coalition for Tuition Equal-
ity - a partnership of vari-
ous student groups seeking to
establish in-state tuition rates
for undocumented students
living in Michigan - hosted
a "graduation" ceremony for
undocumented students to
demonstrate solidarity for the
cause.
Public Policy senior Kevin
Mersol-Barg, the founder of
CTE, said the mock graduation
symbolized a momentous life
event that the coalition hopes
disenfranchised students will
be able to experience in the
future. Though the coalition
has made progress in recent
months, he said he still isn't
satisfied with its current prog-
ress with University adminis-
trators.
"It's been slow going," Mer-
sol-Barg said. "I'm not sure if
our goals are concrete enough
in terms of where we stand and
where the University stands."
LSA sophomore Daniel
Morales - a previously undoc-
umented student who has been
a frequent speaker on tuition
equality issues on campus -
introduced the ceremony's
graduates, a group of undocu-
mented students from south-
west Detroit.
After alluding to Clint East-
wood's infamous speech at the
Republican National Conven-
tion, where the actor spoke to
an empty chair as if President
Barack Obama were sitting in
it, Morales addressed the Uni-
versity's absent president.
He said the coalition would
like Coleman to publicly
acknowledge, on the record,
her support for tuition equal-
ity. He added that he wants the
University to be transparent
in any potential future imple-
mentation processes.
"Unfortunately the Univer-
sity of Michigan doesn't see all

Michigan students the same,"
Morales said. "(Coleman) must
take the steps towards tuition
equality."
The ceremony included
speeches by leaders from seven
University groups, including
the Muslim Students' Associa-
tion, the South Asian Aware-
ness Network and the Latino
Students Organization.
Central Student Govern-
ment President Manish Parikh,
a Business senior, said he
attended the event not only
to display CSG's support, but
also to provide guidance to the
student activists struggling to
work with University leaders.
"One of those aspects of
advice is to keep working with
the administration, and to
keep treating the administra-
tion, who are their elders, with
respect and kindness," Parikh
said.
Sanjay Jolly, a public policy
graduate student and repre-
sentative from the University's
chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, spoke next,
and apologized to Parikh for
ignoring his suggestions of
politeness before starting an
impassioned speech about the
administration's lack of sup-
port.
"I have one thing to say,"
Jolly said to a cheering crowd.
"Stop this bullshit!"
LSA senior Chris Askew-
Merwin said he believes the
group would make faster prog-
ress with the University if it
hosted more dramatic demon-
strations like student sit-ins to
attract the attention of admin-
istrators.
"I'm worried that rallies
won't accomplish as much as
they should," Askew-Merwin
said. "I think the way that we
could really show the power
of the student body is by doing
something a bit more visible."
Public Policy senior Eli Day,
a member of Students Organiz-
ing Against Prisons, said he
was glad to see the strong turn-
out for the event.
"I think it's a righteous
cause," Day said. "I think it's
good to highlight the link-
age between the unavailabil-
ity of education for certain
demographics and the causal
relationship with that and
incarceration."
Engineering senior Kanchan
Swaroop, who wore a "Tuition
Equality" pin on her chest and
clutched a poster in support
of the cause, said she attend-
ed the ceremony because she
believes every student who has
been a Michigan resident their
entire life should pay the in-
state tuition rate.
"No human being can be ille-
gal," Swaroop said.

Tuition equality passes
during Regents meeting

Undocumented
students eligible
for in-state tuition
under new guidelines
ByAARON GUGGENHEIM
ManagingNewsEditor
JULY 18, 2013 - Antonio
Contreras choked up as he
spoke of his two college-bound
sons, Javier and Jose, who are
undocumented students, dur-
ing the public commentary sec-
tion.
"I understand that is the
rules or policies of the Univer-
sity of Michigan ... (but) same
as me you also have kids and
I know you wish the best for
them," Contreras said.
Contreras came from Mexico
18 years ago looking for a better
future for his family but with
his low-income - he only grad-
uated from middle school in
Mexico - paying out-of-state
tuition was impossible.

"(My sons) have what it takes
to become professionals but
sometimes it is impossible for
them to achieve this thing,"
he said. "They consider them-
selves Wolverines."
The pathway for Contreras'
sons, who were both accepted
to the University, to attend got
slightly easier as the Universi-
ty's Board of Regents approved
a changeon Thursday to the
residency guidelines, providing
in-state tuition for both undoc-
umented students and military
veterans.
Regents Andrew Richner
(R- Grosse Pointe Park) and
Andrea Fischer Newman (R-
Ann Arbor) both cast dissent-
ing votes, citing unanswered
questions surrounding the
policy and its potential legal
implications.
These simplified residency
guidelines will provide in-state
residency to those who are
Michigan residents, served in
the U.S. military or attended
hree years of middle school
and two years of high school in

Michigan.
The policy will take effect in
January 2014. Undocumented
students who graduated high
school and applied to the Uni-
versity within 28 months of
graduation will qualify for in-
state tuition.
But for 29,000 undocument-
ed students currently living in
Michigan, federal financial aid
- which provides grants and
loans with low interest rates -
is still unavailable, which com-
plicates the process of paying
for a University education.
Regent Mark Bernstein (D-
Ann Arbor) said only a cen-
tury earlier his family would
have been considered undocu-
mented immigrants, and that
access to higher education has
"always been a ladder of oppor-
tunity" to attaining the Ameri-
can dream.

"There are very few moments
when strands of history weave
together, and for me, today
is one of those extraordinary
moments," Bernstein said.
Bernstein said he commend-
ed the Coalition for Tuition
Equality on their hard work.
The group, which was found-
ed in the fall of 2011, has con-
tinued to advocate for tuition
equality through numerous
protests, and several of its
members served on a task force
with the administration to
develop these new residency
guidelines.
"I think they have just done
such an impressive and dis-
tinguished job, and they have
done it with dignity combined
with passion," Bernstein said.

36 months in prison for Jenson

Allegations surface
questioning Miller's
college credentials
By ADAM RUBENFIRE and
JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily News Editor
and Daily StaffReporter
DEC. 11, 2012 - Jordan Mill-
er, the University's social media
director, resigned Monday amid
allegations that she lied about
acquiring a bachelor's degree. She
was the first to hold the position
when she was hired in February.
Reddit user citizenthrow-
awayx alleged in a post Friday
that Miller did not acquire a
Bachelors of Arts in Journalism
from Columbia College Chicago
as claimed on her resume. The
user posted documents that she
had enrolled but not graduated
from the institution.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald confirmed Tuesday
that the documents posted on
Reddit are legitimate.
"The resume you're seeing
online is accurate; I've checked
that," Fitzgerald said.
William Gregory, a records
specialist at Columbia College
Chicago, confirmed that Miller
did not graduate. According to
Gregory, Miller attended the col-
lege from the fall of2000 through
fall 2003. However, Miller
appears on a program for the col-
lege's spring commencement in
May 2004.
Due to privacy laws, Gregory
said he could not say how many
credits Miller still needed to
graduate.
Fitzgerald said Miller resigned
willingly, and no disciplinary
action was taken against her. As
social media director, Miller was
compensated between $90,000
and $110,000 annually, according
to Daily reports.
Miller released a statement to
the media Tuesday regarding her
resignation, which took effect on
Monday.
"My intention was never to
deceive the University, bht I
acknowledge that I made a mis-
take, and I'm very sorry," Miller
said.
Miller did not respond to

requests for comment on whether
she knew she had known she had
not graduated.
Lisa Rudgers, vice president
for global communications and
strategic initiatives, said in a
statement she appreciated Mill-
er's work at the University.
"I appreciate all the talent and
insight Jordan Miller brought to
elevating the University's social
space," Rudgers said. "Her work
has been stellar, and she has
established a solid foundation
from which to build and grow.
My thoughts and best wishes are
with her."
Fitzgerald said the University
intends to fill the vacancy.
"We have every intention of
filling that position - what we'll
do on an interim basis, we're just
startingto sort that out," Fitzger-
ald said.
He added that it's not yet clear
who will oversee the University's
social media operations in the
meantime.
"This is happening pretty
quickly; I don'thave the details to
tell you who's doing that or how
we are doing," Fitzgerald said.
Miller has held nine jobs since
2009, working as a reporter the
Ann Arbor News in 2007 and as a
lead blogger for Annarbor.com in
2009. She has also created mar-
keting products for Chevrolet,
Kotex and Ford.
In her position at the Univer-
sity, Miller curated the "Univer-
sity of Michigan Social Media"
account, a Facebook account,
several Twitter accounts and a
Pinterest, among other social
profiles. Miller launched the @
UmichStudents Twitter account,
which features a different Uni-
versity student every week.
In a March email from Rudg-
ers announcing Miller's new
position at the University, she
wrote that her 10 years of expe-
rience in communications and
social media made her a good
candidate for the job.
"Jordan has worked as a news-
paper reporter and an ad agency
professional, and is uniquely situ-
ated to bring social media focus
to many aspects of University
communication efforts," Rudgers
wrote.
The University's Twitter was
still being updated mid-Tuesday.

Former UMHS
resident sentenced
at federal court in
child porn case
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
ManagingNews Editor
MARCH 22, 2013 -
DETROIT - Stephen Jenson, a
former medical resident at the
University of Michigan Health
System, was sentenced Thurs-
day to 36 months in federal
prison for the possession of
child pornography.
The sentencing is the mini-
mum mandatory sentence for
possessing child pornography.
Jenson's attorney, Raymond
Cassar, argued that the nature
of his client's crime did not
require additional penalty.
Jenson was arrested by
University Police in Decem-
ber 2011 after it was discov-
ered that he had viewed child
pornography in a University
Hospital lounge. A fellow resi-
dent found his flash drive with
obscene images on it and later
reported the discovery to the
attending physician.
An attorney in the UMHS
initially told the resident that
her concerns about the flash
drive were 'unfounded,' and
neglected to report the incident
to University Police. It wasn't

until six months later that the
incident was re-reported by
the attending physician and
University Police were noti-
fied. University President
Mary Sue Coleman called the
delay a "serious failure on the
part of the institution." Com-
munication problems between
University Police and Hospi-
tal Security discovered during
an internal review of the case
prompted a reorganization
of campus security agencies,
which included the creation of
the Division of Public Safety
and Security, which puts all
agencies under an umbrella
division headed by UMPD
chief Joe Piersante, DPSS's
interim executive director.
Initial state charges were
dropped after the U.S. Secret
Service arrested Jenson on the
federal charges. Jenson was
found to be in possession of 97
images and four videos, some
of which he had viewed using
hospital computers.
Matthew Roth, the assis-
tant U.S. attorney prosecuting
the case, argued in a previ-
ous memo that Jenson should
be sentenced to 48 months in
prison because the crime was
committed on a computer and
the number of images he pos-
sessed, among other factors.
U.S. District Judge Avern
Cohn said though Jenson's
crime did meet such factors
for increasing the sentence,

the guidelines are irrelevant to
the case. Cohn pointed out that
computers are universally used
to view child pornography and
the amount of images that Jen-
son possessed was not large
compared to other cases.
Prosecutors have drawn
attention to the fact that Jen-
son was undergoing pediatric
training at UMHS, noting that
he would eventually be able to
treat children. However, Cas-
sar said he intended to be an
oncologist, not specializing in
pediatrics, and claimed that
his training was unfairly held
against him.
Cassar painted the picture
of a man who had a love for
medicine and a passion for
cancer research but would now
likely not be able to become a
physician.
"He led an extraordinary
life," Cassar told the court. "He
spent the last seven years (in
medicine). He's lost them. He's
done."
Cassar asked the judge to
acknowledge that Jenson does
not present a risk to public
safety, noting that not doing
so would prevent him from
accessing programs like thera-
py in prison.
Cassar said the University
community "abandoned" Jen-
son after his crime was discov-
ered, and therefore asked that
Cohn allow him to serve his
sentence in a prison near his

hometown in Utah.
Cohn confirmed that Jen-
son is not a risk to public safety
and agreed to place him in a
correctional facility near his
hometown. The judge ordered
that Jenson surrender himself
to the court within 90 days of
the sentencing.
In a brief address to the
court, Jenson said he was
aware of the consequences of
possessing child pornography.
"I knew what I did was
wrong," Jenson said. "When
I was looking at the images, I
knew it was wrong."
Jenson told the court that he
would attempt to rehabilitate
himself, both in prison and in
therapy.
"I am trying to do what I
need to do to make myself a
better man," he said.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after he was
sentenced, Jenson said he looks
forward to completing his sen-
tence so that he can work on a
career in medicine.
"My only is hope that after
this chapter of my life with
prison is done, I will be able to
be helping people and practic-
ing medicine," Jenson said.
Before attending medical
school, Jenson was a cancer
researcher. He said he would
go back to research if he is
unable to get a job practicing
medicine upon his release.

SEC accuses
Gilman of assisting
illegal fund activity
By ADAM RUBENFIRE and
AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily News Editor
and Daily Staff Reporter,
NOV. 28, 2012 - Neurology
Prof. Sidney Gilman - who was
accused by the U.S. Securities
and Exchanges Commission of
assisting hedge fund investors in
a historically lucrative $276-mil-
lion insider trading scheme -
has retired from his position at
the University, according to a
University of Michigan Health
System spokesman.
UMHS spokesman Pete
Barkey said in a statement
Wednesday afternoon that Gil-
man retired from his position'
effective Tuesday. Gilman was
the William J. Herdman Distin-
guished University Professor of
Neurology.
Gilman served as the chair of
the Department of Neurology
from 1977 to 2004, and received
the Medical School's 2010 Dis-
tinguished Achievement Award.
UMHS also holds an annual Sid
Gilman and Carol Barbour Lec-
ture in Neuroscience, and the
hospital's neurology service is
named in his honor
Barkey declined to comment
on whether the name of the ser-
vice or the lectureship would be

changed.
In a civil lawsuit filed Nov.
20 in the U.S. District Court in
the Southern District of New
York, the SEC alleged that Gil-
man received about $100,000
to inform Mathew Martoma, a
hedge fund portfolio manager
for CR Intrinsic Investors, about
the progress and negative results
of a clinical trial for an Alzheim-
er's drug being developed by the
Elan Corporation and Wyeth,
Inc., now owned by Pfizer, Inc.
The SEC claims that CR
Intrinsic accumulated $276 mil-
lion in profits or avoided losses
by short selling and liquidating
its stock before Gilman made a
public announcement about the
drug on July 29, 2008. The SEC
also asserts Martoma received
a $9.3-million bonus from CR
Intrinsic in 2008, much of which
came from trades made on Gil-
man's information.
Gilman earned about $79,000
from the Elan Corporation for
being the Safety Monitoring
Chair for the trials of the drug
in question, bapineuzumab,
accordingto the SEC.
Elan Corporation's stock
price fell from more than $30
in July 2008 to less than $10 in
the days following the July 29,
2008 announcement. Wyeth
dropped less significantly, from
an average of more than $46 in
days before the announcement,
to about $39 for the next three
days.
At the time, it was reported by

the Dow Jones Newswire that
the 240-patient study found the
drug had serious side effects,
including fluid buildup in the
brains of 12 trial participants.
Safety issues with the drug wor-
ried investors, causing the value
of the stocks to drop.
Martoma and Gilman were
paired legally through an expert
network firm. These firms are
commonly used to connect
those in the business world with
experts in various fields, such as
medicine. In recent years, the
SEC has pursued a number of
high profile insider trading cases
in which such firms have played
a role.
The firm used by Martoma
and Gilman has not been offi-
cially identified, but Gilman's
resume notes that he has held
a consulting position with Ger-
son Lehrman, among several
other firms, since 2002. The
Wall Street Journal reported
that individuals familiar with
the case have confirmed that the
expert network firm used in the
scheme was Gerson Lerhman.
Bret Coons - a spokesman
for the Joint Commission, a
hospital accreditation orga-
nization - said external deci-
sions of individual employees
would not generally affect a
hospital's accreditation unless
patient safety or care quality was
impacted.
"The Joint Commission's
accreditation looks at issues
of patient safety and quality of

care andwould not be applicable
to the personal financial prac-
tices of employees of an accred-
ited health care organization,"
Coons said.
Coons could not confirm
whether or not Gilman was
being investigated.
Gilman has signed a non-
prosecution agreement with
the SEC, meaning he will not be
criminally charged because he
has agreed to testify and cooper-
ate with further investigations.
He will pay $234,000 in settling
the suit.
Ora Pescovitz, the execu-
tive vice president for medical
affairs, Douglas Strong, CEO
of the University of Michigan
Hospitals and Health Centers
and Medical School Dean James
Woolliscroft sent an e-mail to
UMHS faculty and staff Thurs-
day regarding the incident,
reminding them to respect con-
fidential information and main-
tain the integrity of the hospital
and health system.
The SEC's final target appears
to be the parent company of CR
Intrinsic, SAC Capital Advisors.
Though he is not explicitly men-
tioned in the suit, it is suspected
that Steven Cohen, the compa-
ny's founder and owner, is impli-
cated in the scheme.
The SEC alleged that Marto-
ma collaborated with CR Intrin-
sic's portfolio manager, known
as "Portfolio Manager A," who
is identified as the founder and

MAY 4 2013 - At a 50,000-per-
son event that was hardly
improvised, the spring 2013
University graduates listened to
Twitter CEO Dick Costolo as he
spoke about the value of improvi-
sation and living in the moment.
More than 5,000 graduating
students took to the Big House
on Saturday for commencement
under sunny skies and a light
wind. The video scoreboards dis-
played recorded messages from
graduating students and tweets
with #MGoGrad, fitting for an
event headlined by the chief exec-
utive of hashtags.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman gave remarks ind
presented honorary degrees
on behalf of the University's
Board of Regents to Pulitzer-
prize-winning historian David
McCullough, University alum
and philanthropist William
Brehm, famed ballerina Suzanne
Farrell and University alum Rosa-
beth Kanter, a business professor
at Harvard University.
Coleman's address challenged
graduates to follow in the path of
historic University alumni: "You
will create change for the better,
you will work on behalf of your
neighbors, and you will do it with
dignity and integrity."
Costolo, a 1985 University
graduate, began his address -
which he jokingly said he began
planning for Saturday morning -
by taking a quick iPhone picture
to tweet out to his 1 million fol-
lowers, thanking his parents and
reminding graduates to thank
whoever supported them through
their education.
Costolo, who was a computer

science student during his time
at the University, had a change of
heart regarding his career after
taking an acting class his senior
year. It turned out to be more
than "saying Arthur Miller lines
to each other," so he took anoth-
er course the next semester and
began stand-up comedy. Turning
down programming job offers, he
moved to Chicago to try his hand
at improvisational comedy with
the Second City, the famous the-
ater company.
Costolo offered the picture-
perfect version of how life in Chi-
cago could have panned out, then
explained the reality.
"In the real-world story of what
happened, I decided to make a big
bet on myself and take the chance
to do this because it's what I
love," Costolo said. "I was grind-
ing away for a long time and had
no money, and we would rehearse
during the dayand perform these
little theaters at night for free and
I was taking classes during the
day at Second City, as well, trying
to learn improvisation and even-
tually had to get out because Ihad
no money. So I put my CS degree
from Michigan to use wrapping
flatware and selling place settings
at Crate and Barrel."
Improvisation, he said, is less
than a skill than an expectation
for graduates as they follow their
passions.
He passed on advice given to
'him by a director at Second City:
"The beauty of improvisation
is you're experiencing it in the
moment, if you try to plan what
the next line will be, you're just
going to be disappointed,"he said.
To end his often humorous
remarks, Costolo invoked myri-
ad careers University graduates
would pursue and had advice no
matter where they end up: "Be
right there, and nowhere else, in
that moment. Soak it all it. And
remenber to say thank you."
In an interview after com-
mencement, Costolo said, "You
have this intellectual sense of
how big the crowd is, but until
you go out there and experience

it, you don't really have an appre-
ciation for it."
"You have to have a north
star," he said of the path - or
lack thereof - he endorsed, "but
you can't constantly worry about,
'Well, and then I'm supposed to
do this,' because life doesn't work
that way and you won't experi-
ence your life. You'll be living it in
service to some expectations that
are fiction."
LSA graduate Anisha Chadha
was the only student speaker on
Saturday. Though she came to
the University concerned about
how she would feel among some
25,000 undergraduates, Chadha
said joining student organiza-
tions allowed her to create a
small, unique community on
campus.
"I realized, no matter what we
were doing, it was almost impos-
sible for me to feel small," Chadha
said in her address. "Even when
I was in this Big House, with
114,803 other people, I began to
realize that what I was feeling
was not smallness, but rather I
was feeling like I was a part of
something bigger than myself."
Though 'most 'use the term
"Michigan Difference" to
describe the academic and cul-
tural caliber of the University,
Chadha explained it as the impact
Michigan graduates can have on
humanity.
"It is the difference we were
given the opportunity to make,"
Chadha said. "I is the knowledge,
the empathy and the skills we
have gained herd that are needed
to be able to make a thoughtful
difference in the lives of others."
As she concluded her speech,
Chadha reminded her fellow
graduates that they represent the
University and the power of its
graduates in their future endeav-
ors.
"Always remember: you
are contributing to our class's
'Michigan Difference' and the
difference made by all of the Wol-
verines before us."
Nursinggraduate Shana Walk-
er participated as flag bearer,

designated to carry and mount
the ceremonial flag of the School'
of Nursing. She said she was
honored to sit on stage with the
University's deans, regents and
administrators.
Reflecting on her undergradu-
ate career here, Walker said she
would always remember the
time she spent studying abroad
in South Africa. She stressed that
students should participate in
study-abroad programs and stu-
dent organizations before they
graduate to make their time at the
University unique.
Though some graduates are
concerned about entering a still-
recovering job market, Walker
wasn't. Rather, she said feels
qualified to enter her field and
expects to find employment.
Other graduates, such as LSA
graduate Margo Koutsouradis,
said they feel a mix of fear and
excitement in starting the next
chapter of their lives. Koutsou-
radis said she's not entirely sure
of her post-graduation plans, but
noted that she will be taking the
LSAT in the coming months and
taking time off before going to
law school.
Music, Theater & Dance gradu-
ate Austin Hoeltzelwas chosento
perform the National Anthem to
begin the ceremony.
"I was honored to be asked,
and it was the perfect way to fin-
ish my time here at the Univer-
sity," Hoeltzel said.
Hoeltzel will soon attend the
University of Houston to pur-
sue a Master's degree in vocal
performance. Like many fellow
graduates, he said he was happy
to embrace the enormity the
University while making long-
lasting friendships and memo-
ries through smaller groups on
campus, including the Men's Glee
Club.
"The University just has every-
thing. It's got the big University
feel, but then I was at the Music
School on North Campus thathad
that conservatory feel. There's
amazing groups to be a part of...
it'sjust been reallywonderful."

Winter graduates
hear fromn'U'
alum and Grinnell
College president
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
DEC. 16, 2012 - Cameras
flashed, families cheered and
beaming graduates donned
in gowns and sashes proudly
accepted their diplomas at the
Crisler Center Sunday afternoon,
leavingcthe University to join the
ranks of leaders and best across
the globe.
The 2012 Winter Commence-
ment ceremony celebrated the
graduates' current accomplish-
ments and looked toward the
future.
University alum Raynard S.
Kington, the keynote speaker
and president of Grinnell College,
told grads that these futures must
involve embracingthe unknown.
"I believe it's OK to admit that
you do not'know the answers,"
Kington said to the crowd.
"Admitting incomplete knowl-
edge is not a sign of failure. Fail-
ure only comes when you stop
trying to find the answers."
Kington said the University
gives students knowledge, but
does not give them the answers to
life's most pressing questions. For
these, he said, students must stay
curious, adaptable and persistent.
"Not knowing is part of the
human experience," Kington
said. "That funny feeling of not
knowing must be followed by.
the impulse to wonder why and
to look for answers. This is what
leaders do."
He ended his remarks
acknowledging a University edu-
cation has undoubtedly equipped
students with the ability to
understand and question what
they do not know.
"I leave you with my best
wishes, and my greatest hopes,"
Kington concluded. "May you
prosper.".
University Provost Philip
Hanlon,whorecentlywaselected
the next president of Dartmouth
College,' asked the graduating
class to reflect on their time at the
University. He said the school's
wide breadth of opportunities,
cultural diversity, service expe-
riences and leadership training
wouldhelpthemgoingforward.
"Michigan graduates not
only engage in public discourse
and debate on issues facing the
world, Michigan graduates actu-
ally shape the discourse," Hanlon
said. "They point the way for-
ward."

University President Mary
Sue Coleman discussed the
unceasing passion and tenacity
of the graduates. Referencing the
current divisive political climate
and discouraging employment
opportunities, Coleman said it
was understandable for students
to be anxious and even jaded
about the future.
She then spoke of Raoul Wal-
lenberg - a Swedish alum and
humanitarian who helped free
100,000 Jews from Nazi con-
centration camps - as a shining
example of what a University
alum can accomplish even in the
mid.t"of(aBterrible situation. ,
"Like Raul Wallenberg you
cannot imagine the challenges
that will await you, you cannot
predichow youwill react," Cole-
man said. "(But) believe that you,
like Wallenberg_.. can and will
make a difference in transform-
ing our state, our nation and
our world with your ideas and
actions."
LSA graduate Katharine
Stockrahm gave the remarks on
behalf of the students, where she
detailed the "blood, sweat and
tears" that went in to earning
her University degree, focusing
on the memories made along the
way.
"People always talk about the
'Michigan Difference,' as if it
could be defined simplyby a care-
fully selected string of words,"
Stockrahm said. "'m here to say
it's really a collection of experi-
ences."
Kington and five others -
ranging from a playwright to
United States Appeals Court
judge - received honorary
degrees from the University and
the Board of Regents.
After the ceremony, gradu-
ates received bouquets of flow-
ers, balloons and stuffed animals
from smiling friends and family
members. Some hugged relatives,
children and spouses, while oth-
ers sought out friends to say final
goodbyes.
Taking a break from family
photos and tearful hugs, Joe B.
Brown, the father of Engineering
graduate Luree Brown, said he
dedicated himself to educating
his daughter, and has looked for-
ward to her graduation day.
"I felt it was very special when
the University of Michigan want-
ed her to be here," Brown said.
"To see her complete it is inspir-
ing for me."
Public Health graduate Katie

ny was touching, but can't wait to

ADMINISTRATION
Regents approve
reorganization of
campus security

Pollack to be next
University provost

Coleman appoints
vice provost to fill
Hanlon's role
ByAUSTEN HUFFORD and
ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter and
Daily News Editor -
OCT. 19, 2012 - In response to
organizational issues discovered
in the aftermath of last year's
child pornography case at the
University Hospital, University
Police, Housing Security, Hos-
pital Security and other public
safety agencies have been reor-
ganized into a larger organiza-
tion called the Division of Public
Safety and Security.
The new Division of Public
Safety and Security, which was
announced at the University's
Board of Regents meeting in
Flint on Friday, will be respon-
sible for all security and public
safety concerns at the University.
The University announced that
Joe Piersante, current executive
director of DPS, will assume the
positions of director of DPSS as
well as police chief until a per-
manent director can be found.
The newly formed position'
of University Police Chief will
report to the executive director,
who will report to University
President Mary Sue Coleman.
Before the announcement,
the University's various secu-
rity organizations cooperated in
campus safety operations, but
were independently managed.
Regent Laurence Deitch (D-

Bingham Farms), the board's
chair, said in a statement that
campus safety is one of the Uni-
versity's top priorities.
"The safety and security of
our University family is sacro-
sanct. We must be and we will
always be fiercely vigilant when
it comes to campus safety and
security," he said.
President Coleman said in a
statement that the new DPSS will
ensure campus remains safe.
"We've followed a challeng-
ing road to reach this point, but,
I see a clear path forward," Cole-
man said. "I am confident we
will continue to see significant
improvements, in partbecause of
our shared vision for the future
of safety and security on our
campus." '
Regent Olivia Maynard (D-
Goodrich) said in an interview
after Friday's Flint meeting that
the board is taking security very
seriously in light of the Jenson
incident.
"There wasn't good coordi-
nation and sometimes it takes
a pretty tough thing to happen
for everyone to realize that coor-
dination has to be replaced,"
Maynard said. "I know we're all
serious about it, everyone."
Maynard added that the new
system will lead to greater unity
among University safety pro-
grams.
"All the various agencies that
have some kind of law applica-
tion are all goingto work togeth-
er," she said.
In regards to the search for,a
University Police Chief, she said
Piersante will continue to serve

as interim leader before he has
the opportunity to retire.
"He's ready to retire, so that's
good, and he will do that and
there willbe a national search for
someone to come in," she said.
University spokesman - Rick
Fitzgerald said in a statement
that Piersante "has made no deci-
sion about when he may retire."

Coleman appoints
vice provost to fill
Hanlon's role
By JEN CALFAS,
SAM GRINGLAS AND
PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporters and
DailyNewsEditor -
JAN. 31, 2013 - University
President Mary Sue Coleman has
appointed Martha Pollack as the
next University provost and exec-
utive vice president for academic
affairs.
Since 2010, Pollack has served
as vice provost for academic and
budgetary affairs under current
Provost Philip Hanlon, who is set
to become the president of Dart-
mouth College in July.
If approved by the Board
of Regents at its Feb. 21 meet-
ing, Pollack will assume a two-
year appointment beginning
May 6. The University made the
announcement in a press release
early Wednesday morning.
"I am thrilled fo have this
opportunity to serve the Uni-
versity of Michigan as provost,"
Pollack said in a statement. "This
remains one of the world's pre-
mier institutions of higher educa-
tion, and I am both humbled and
honored to be a part of an incred-
ibly dedicated leadership team."
As provost, Pollack will act as
the University's chief academic
officer and chief budgetary offi-
cer. In addition to her current
role as a professor in the School
of Information and professor of
computer science and engineer-
ing in the College of Engineering,
Pollack will advance and oversee
teaching and research in each of
the University's institutes and 19
schools and colleges.
In her current role as vice pro-
vost, Pollack works closely with
the Hanlon to craft budgetary
policy, most notably the Univer-
sity's general fund budget. Pollack
plays a large role in supervising
assessments of the University's.
schools and colleges and during
has been at the forefront of efforts
to expand the University's rela-
tionship with Coursera, a massive
open online course platform.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily Wednesday, Cole-
man cited Pollack's work with
Hanlon as an integral factor in the
selection.
"They've got such a great team
in that office in termsof analyzing
the budgetcand where we can look
for cost savings - where we can
make investments that are really
going to move the institution,"
Coleman said. "She worked really
well with the team and with Phil
(Hanlon) over the few years she
was in that role, and it's obvious
to me that she's somebody with

enormous potential."
Pollack has worked in part-
nership with Hanlon, deans
and budget directors not only
on budgetary issues, but also in
developing and advancing new
academic programs. Last fall,
Pollack and Hanlon taught a one-
credit course on finance in higher
education to help students better
understandthe process of budget-
ary and fiscal planning.
In a statement, Coleman said
Pollack's array of experiences has
prepared her to assume the Uni-
versity's second highest adminis-
trative role.
"Martha Pollack is an effective
leader who understands how to
maintain world-class academics
through a disciplined approach to
finances," Coleman said. "She has
a deep understanding of the chal-
lenges and opportunities current-
ly facing higher education. Her
appointment as provost reflects
a deep knowledge of this institu-
tion that is grounded in her work
as a faculty member, department
chair and dean."
Prior to being appointed vice
provost. - a position Hanlon held
before his own ascent to provost
- Pollack served as dean of the
School of Information. During
her 13 years at the University,
she has also served as associate
chair for computer science and
engineering in the Department of
Electrical Engineering and Com-
puter Science. Her research hasa
focused largely on the advance-
ment of artificial intelligence, and
she has also worked as editor-in-
chief of the Journal of the Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of
Artificial Intelligence.
In an interview with the Daily
Wednesday, Pollack said she is
thrilled to fulfill the position,
and hopes to help the University
adjust to dramatic changes facing
higher education.
"You can see that as a chal-
lenge or an opportunity - I think
it's both," Pollack said. "We're
at a moment where there's real
realization where we have to do
thingsdifferently."
Pollack attributes much of her
knowledge and qualifications for
the position to Hanlon's mentor-
ship while she worked as vice pro-
vost in addition to her experience
in previous roles at the University.
Her goals include furthering
the use of educational technol-
ogy to adapt to the trend toward
online learning.
"I'm excited about ways to
use that so we can free up time
for more hands-on activities and
to hold down costs," she said. "I
think we need to be more produc-
tive, and one way we can do that
is making creative use of online
technologies. I think we'll see
how that plays out in the coming
years."
Pollack stressed the impor-

tance of affordability for students
and added that she will work to
put the University atthe forefront
of affordability.
"I think we have to figure out
how to continue to deliver a first-
rate education - one that gives
hands-oneducationthat wellhelp
(students) become leaders in the
21st century - and do it in a way
that allows access to students,
whatever their socioeconomic
background," Pollack said.
When asked about her future
beyond her new role as proost,
Pollack said she wants to focus on
the next two years ahead.
Pollack earned her under-
graduate degree in linguistics
from Dartmouth College in 1979,
a Master of Science in Engineer-
ing in computer science and engi-
neering in 1984 and Ph.D. in the
same subject in 1986 - both from
the University of Pennsylvania.
She previously taught at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh in various
capacities from 1991to 2000.
Judy Lawson, assistant dean
for academic and student affairs
for the School of Information,
said as a fellow dolleague she most
admires Pollack's unwavering
commitment to students.
"When Dr. Pollack first start-
ed in her position as dean of the
school of information, I was
struck by her incredible energy,
enthusiasm and down-to-earth
approach," Lawson said. "I always
,felt that student interests were a
top priority for Dr. Pollack."
Moreover, Lawson said Pol-
lack's information background
aligns perfectly with the role of
provost. She said Pollack often
spoke about the ways in which
the digital age was transforming
many aspects of everyday life,
including the ways people learn
and educate others.
"Dr. Pollack brings an uncanny
ability to manage competing pri-
oritiesand move an organization
towards greater levels ofsuccess,"
Larson said. "I anticipate that,
as provost, she will foster high
levels of engagement in making
the university operate more effi-
ciently and effectively. She also
has a great sense of humor, which
is always a bonus."
CSG President Manish Parikh
said in a statement that he had the
pleasure of working with Pollack
on the University's budget.
"The Vice Provost was one of
the first administrators I had the
pleasure of working with as CSG
President," Parikh said. "She is
gentle, kind and has always been
a tireless advocate for our student
body. Students and student lead-
ers across campus will benefit
from her passion, ingenuity and
vision."
In a Nov. 29 interview, Pol-
lack said the University remained
financially solvent, largely due

opportunity for us to nurture
graduate education within our
ecosystem."
Regent Andrea Fischer New-
man (R-Ann Arbor) echoed
Coleman, saying Michigan will
be the only university to have a
residential hall option for gradu-
ate students.
Newman added that one of the
purposes of the regents' January
trip to California was to speak
with Munger.
"This was one of the reasons
we went to Los Angeles,"
Munger said. "His involvement
and interest is unlike anything
I've ever seen before, and we're
just thrilled. This will set
Michigan apart from every other
University in the country with
dedicated graduate housing
across disciplines."
The regents approved the pur-
chases of four properties in the
area between West Quad Resi-
dence Hall and the Perry Building
to create space for the residence
hall. The $3.16 million purchase
will acquire properties at 535 and
537 South Division Street and 401
and 409 East Madison Street,
which are registered to former
Athletic Director Bill Martin. The
funds will also be used to purchase
properties at 541 and 543 South
Division Street through eminent
domain, which allows the Uni-
versity to force to the owner, Copi
Properties, to sell the property for
a fair, market-value price.
The regents also voted to name
the newly approved residential
hall in honor of Munger. In 2007,
Munger donated $3 million to
the Law School for lighting and
infrastructure improvements in
Hutchins Hall and the William
W. Cook Legal Research Library.
In addition, Munger contributed
$20 million more for renovations
within the Lawyers Club, which
are currently underway.

While Slottow presented the
naming to the board as the "easi-
est" action to approve, Coleman
said Munger's contribution was a
"monumental act of generosity."
In a statement issued at the
meeting, Munger said the dona-
tion reflects his appreciation for
the University.
"I particularly want to avoid
any perception that I claim large
donative merit," Munger said.
"After all, I waited until my 90th
year before making the gift, then
gained friendship and creative
joy in working with the univer-
sity in a very interesting design
effort likely to have a good out-
come, while I parted with assets
I soon won't need."
The University has con- -
tracted with Integrated Design
Solutions and Hartman-Cox
Architects to design the new
residence hall. To continue the
University's efforts towards sus-
tainability, the building will be
constructed based on U.S. Green
Building Council's LEED certi-
fication system. The residence
hall will also exceed standard
energy efficiency codes by more
than 30 percent.
Slottow added that the addi-
tion of a residence hall could
potentially lead to more students
to apply for graduate programs
at the University.
"I don't think there's any ques-
tion that it will transform our
ability to continue to be an even
stronger attractor to students
because it will be such an iconic
building and transformative
living experience for graduate
students."success," Larson said.
"I anticipate that, as provost, she
will foster high levels of engage-
ment in making the university
operate more efficiently and
effectively. She also has a great
sense of humor, which is always
a bonus."

Serious flooding

Stu

Connection
completely down
while students
study for midterms
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily News Editor
FEB. 27, 2013 - On Tuesday
night, in the midst of midterms,
Internet went down across cam-
pus. Service returned at 4:52
a.m. after about five hours.
During the outage, the
Internet was not connected to
the University server, making
CTools and Wolverine Access
inaccessible to outside users.
The problem stemed from Merit
Network, an Ann Arbor-based
Internet service provider for
Michigan's public universities.
"We've got all hands on deck;
we're trying to figure it out,"
Merit CEO Donald Welch said
during the outage.
Welch was not immediately
able to determine the source
of the issue, but said Merit was
experiencing "a lot" of prob-
lems. He said the issue started
at around 11 p.m.
Michigan State University,
Eastern Michigan University,

Grand Valley State University
and Washtenaw Community
College also experienced tech-
nical issues.
Elwood Downing, a spokes-
man for Merit, said the compa-
ny's technicians determined the
source of the issue was at one of
Merit's core routers located in
Chicago, where Merit engineers
were able to determine the core
router was not forwarding the
packets to the greater Internet.
Once the company discov-
ered the issue, Downing said
engineers moved everything'
over manually to another path.
Rob Belinski, a representa-
tive for information and Tech-
nology Services operations,
confirmed Tuesday that stu-
dents on University computers
could access CTools, umich.edu
and Wolverine Access because
they are housed on the Univer-
sity's intranet, which is pow-
ered by local servers. However,
any non-University websites
were inaccessible.
Although University e-mail
could be accessed, it appeared
that no mail could be sent or
received.
Downing said the problem
only affected a small percent-
age of people served by Merit
Network, as the malfunction

occurred after normal busi-
ness hours. Merit engineers are
reviewing the incident further
to determine if it was a hard-
ware or software malfunction
at the core router.
LSA sophomore Jeffrey But-
ler said he had three midterms
coming up this week and was
"livid" when he lost access to
his courses' resources on the
CTools website' Tuesday night.
He said he usually studies late
at night and the Internet mal-
function was "extremely incon-
venient."
"I got through it, but it
unnerved me a lot," Butler said.
LSA freshman Ryne Menhen-
nick said being unable to access
CTools was an issue for him the
night before he had an exam. He
said he solved the complication
by going to the Union and using
site computers to print materi-
als.
"It made studying for mid-
terms difficult ... I was pretty
stressed out," Menhennick said.

EQUALITY
From Page 3C
University's chapter of Student
Veterans of America, said after
all the sacrifices made by vet-
erans in Iraq and Afghanistan,
they deserved to not have to go
through the hurdle of proving
their residency
to receive in-state tuition.
"(That policy was) disap-
pointing to a lot of veterans and
it means a lot to us that this pol-
icy is being reviewed," Simister
said.
Simister said the next gener-
ation of political leaders could
come from those who served in
the armed forces and would like
those leaders to come "with the
Michigan difference."
In an interview after the
meeting, Newman said she
did not support the measure
because it she did not feel it was
within the jurisdiction of the
University to make immigra-
tion policy.
"(I have questions) about
whether this is appropriate
under federal law and believe
this type of national issue
should be resolved at the federal
level," Newman said. "Although
I am supportive of the expan-
sion of in-state tuition for vet-
erans who have served our
nation."
Bernstein said in an inter-
view after the meeting that he
was satisfied with the policy
passed and that this was the
first step to reducing barriers

for undocumented students.
"There is a lot of work to be
done but this was a step to be
taken before any others occur,"
Bernstein said.
While a form of tuition
equality has passed at the Uni-
versity level, other higher edu-
cation institutions across the
state have yet to extend in-state
tuition to undocumented stu-
dents.
In April, Rep. Jeff Irwin
(D-Ann Arbor) introduced a
bill in the Michigan state leg-
islature that would introduce
tuition equality across the
state. However, Irwin said he
might expect a vote to play out
along party lines, as in this
afternoon's decision where
both Republicans provided the
only dissent.
While Richner and Fischer
Newman cited concerns regard-
ing the legality of the Regent's
action, Irwin said the Regents
acted within the University's
autonomous status as granted
by the state constitution.
As an elected board, Irwin
said the Regents have full juris-
diction in making the decision.
Still, Irwin hasn't ruled out the
possibility of a court challenge
against the new guidelines. But
even with potential obstacles,
Irwin predicts the leadership
of most Michigan colleges will
look at the University's decision
and arrive at the same conclu-
sion.
Though Irwin said he lauded
the University administration's
efforts in thoughtfully consid-
ering the issue, policymakers

must still work towards more
widespread policies at a state
and federal level.
LSA sophomore Dan
Morales, spokesperson for
CTE, said he was happy a mea-
sure was passed, but that it
wasn't as inclusive as he would
have liked, citing the lack of a
promise for financial support
for undocumented students and
the strict guidelines on having
to attend to both a Michigan
high school and middle school.
"We want to make sure the
University will meet the full
need of undocumented students
as well," he said.
Morales added that one ave-
nue to achieving this would be
through establishing a schol-
arship in the upcoming capital
campaign.
In regards to possible legal
challenges to the policy,
Morales said he was certain the
University would stand behind
its policy.
"There are some legal hur-
dles ... but I am confident that
the University will go up to bat
on this issue as they have on
previous issues like affirmative
action," Morales said.
He said CTE would con-
tinue in the fall to work with
the administrators to expand
access to higher education.
"In-state tuition is only one
step to creating truly equal
access to higher education for
these students."

to the careful planning by Han-
lon, but that serious budget issues
would continue to be a main issue
for the nextprovost.
"Many of the (challenges) are
going to be continuations of the
ones he had to deal with. Many of
them are of course financial," Pol-
lack said. "There's been a serious
decline in state support for public
education, and we'll have to come
to gripswiththat."
"We're going to continue to
work hard ... but the fundamental
(budget) model is sound."
Pollack will receive a salary of
$450,000 - less than Hanlon's
$509,000 - according to Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald.
Fitzgerald added that there was
no search committee formed to
hire a new Provost, but Coleman
consulted various people across
campus while making her deci-
sion. s
"I consulted with a lot of people

around the institution because
obviously anybody takingthat role
you want to make sure that they
are establishinggood relationships
- thatthey are clear,that theytake
advice - and all those things come
together," Coleman said Wednes-
day.
In an interview in December,
Hanlon predicted the University
would choose atalented successor.
"Ithink we'llget someone really
terrific in the job, someone really
skilled," Hanlon said. "They'll
know exactly what they're doing,
I'msure."
Hanlon also granted some
advice, stressingthe importance of
facilitating the vast resources the
University offers.
"We have terrific students, and
we have terrific faculty and we've
got the human resources talent to
beat any place," Hanlon said. "It's
really a question of opportunity to
take all thisbrainpowerandtalent
and really take this place to per-
form at aneven higher level than it
has been."

all the while puffing away on an
oversized tobacco pipe. It really is
the little things that make a Quen-
tin Tarantino movie special.
Little things and violence -
pulpy, whimsical, hilarious vio-
lence.
And if you've seen Taranti-
no's latest masterpiece "Django
Unchained," you'll know there's
just something inexpressibly spe-
cial about watching a woman fly
10 feet in the wrong direction after
taking a single bullet from an old-
fashioned six-shooter. Over the

last two decades, it's this quirky
take on violence, almost comic
book-like in its exaggeration,
that has allowed the world's most
knowledgeable director to use
buckets ofpastyfauxbloodtomold
a genre of his own.
A genre in which the extrava-
gant displays of ferocity are
skillfully framed by beautiful, self-
referential lines of dialogue and
light-hearted contexts to pay hom-
age to the most forgotten corners
of B-movie history. "Django" is an
undeniable product of this genre.
In so many words, it is Tarantino's
love letter to the classic Sergio Cor-
bucci spaghetti western, featuring
the same recognizable Southern
setting and the same stereotypi-
cal N-word-spewing, gun-slinging
Southernfolk.
But there's a catch.
The two main characters, as
can be expected of any Tarantino
production, are written specifi-
cally to stick out of this ostensibly
well-trodden background. The
first is Dr. King Schultz (Christoph
Waltz, "Inglourious Basterds"), a
bounty hunter hired by the nation-
al government to dispatch known
criminals and sell their corpses
for sizable rewards. Naturally, he's
also a German ex-dentist with per-
fectly manicured fingernails and a
soft spot for slaves.
On a routine mission to locate
and execute three ex-cons, our
smooth-talking European friend

needs the help of a recently sold
slave to identify his three targets.
Enter "D-J-A-N-G-O ... the D is
silent" (Jamie Foxx, "Collateral"),
Tarantino's take on those 19th-
century cowboys found in early
Clint Eastwood westerns. Except,
of course, this cowboy is black,
and represents the hand of bloody
African-American revenge, much
in the same waythe Basterds sym-
bolized a collective Jewish ven-
geance in "Inglourious Basterds."
Django is later freed by Schultz,
who helps transform him into the
"fastest gun in the south," finally
agreeing to assist in locating and
freeing his enslaved wife, Broom-
hilda (Kerry Washington, "The
Last King of Scotland").
Unlike -most other Tarantino
films, "Django" does not feature
many strong female characters.
Disappointingly, Broomhilda is
really nothing more than a dam-
sel in distress, visions of her
pretty face and simple demeanor
frequently appearing on screen to
beckon our hero forward, towards
old Mississippi's version of hell on
earth.
In this hell, the devil's throne is
occupied by Calvin Candie, played

Like in any good western, when
the good meets the bad, things go

still that kid working at the video

Tarantino, now having made

grown as a writer and director.
In "Django," the scenes of vehe-

How Claire Danes
became unstoppable

For twoyears, Claire
Danes has been invincible.
Since 2010, she has been
nominated
for nine sig-
nificant
awards (two
Emmys, two
Satellites,
two Golden
Globes,
one SAG,
one Critics' KAYLA
Choice and UPADHYAYA
one Televi-
sion Critics
Association) for her roles in the
HBO biopic "Temple Grandin"
and Showtime's thriller "Home-
land."
She won all nine.
I first discovered Danes in
seventh grade. I was atla friend's
house watching TeenNick - my
family only had basic cable at
the time, so thisawas a big deal -
when "My So-Called Life" came
on. As unpolished and bluff asa
middle schooler's diary, "Life"
was unlike any of the moral-
izingteen shows I watched at
the time ("Boy Meets World"
and "7th Heaven" beingsome of
the worst offenders of twisting
adolescence into romanticized
parables).
I caught episodes sporadically,
unable to watch the series from
start to finish until Netflix came
around, but even in fragmented
pieces, I fell for Danes's Angela
Chase, who thought beinga
woman meant dyeing her hair
without her mother's permis-
sion, wearing dark red lipstick
and dating boys who drink their
coffee black. I treasured Angela's
striking, star-crossed friend-
ship with Rayanne, like Angela
clutching Tarot cards close to
her heart.
Much of MSCL's charm came
from its emotionally honest writ-
ing and characters, but Danes
was its beating heart, her natural
delver -full ofuns" likes"
and uneven pauses - injecting
Angela with truth.
We've quite literally watched
Danes grow up on our TV
screens. She was only 15 years
old when she won her first Gold-
en Globe for Best Lead Actress in
a Drama in 1995, and she beat out
contenders with well more than
double her experience. In her
acceptance speech, she was as
plain-spoken as Angela, but for-
got to thank her parents. Which
is why, 17 years later, she was
sure to thank them right away
when she accepted the same
exact award for her performance
as the charged and discerning
Carrie Mathison in "Homeland."
I told you - Claire Danes knows
how to win awards.
Nowadays, every TV critic
worth his or her salt is head-
over-heels for her, but this
wasn't always the case. For a
brief period in the late '90s,
Danes was incredibly unpopular

Unsurprising Swift

Ushering in the era of
Justin Timberlake

'Red' can't add

pers call you out and humiliate you
on live television.
So Taylor Swiftmaynotbe deal-
ing with hampering toils of life -
comingup with rent or job hunting
in this economy like the rest of us
- but where amore and being a
mega-star is concerned, she has
been through the ringer.
Red,her fourth LP, comes on the
heels of Swift's highly document-
ed summer at the Kennedy com-

breakup single "We Are Never
Ever Getting Back Together" and
the hipster-tastic accompanying

rity?

is a step forward. Swift is trying,
perhaps for the first time, to sin-
cerely and completely depart from

star-by-the-numbers persona. The
physical changes are all there: the
Instagram album cover, the matte
red lipstick, the striped shirts with
oxfords.
Musically, it's there too: The
songs on Red are a little longer, a
little darker, a little richer lyrically.
But the funny thing about depar-
tures is they require absolute and
genuine commitment. A little red
lipstick and a duet with Ed Sheer-
an isn't quite enough to catapult
Swiftintothe musicalelite,butlike
with the rest of her music, it's fun
as hell listening to the attempt.
But still, it's definitely saying
something that Swift is one of the
last major pop stars standing who
has the guts to produce actual hit
songs that are (for the most part)
predicated on guitars, bass and
drums - a setup which is quickly
marching into archaic territory.
"State of Grace" capitalizes on
some heavy arena-rock drums and
reverb-laden riffs. "Sad Beautiful
Tragic" is pure college-radio lite
rock along the lines of '90s staples
the Cranberries and Mazzy Star. "I
Knew You Were Trouble" is per-
haps the cutest use of dubstep in
modern pop (don't question it).
For a star with some of the best
pop instincts in the biz, unfortu-
nately Swift's duds stand out pret-
ty starkly. "The Last Time" is over
five minutes long, and limps along

lethargically with a mopey orches-
tra telling you the appropriate sad
emoji to resemble while listening.
Presumably, the song is supposed
to be a serious ballad-slash-duet
with a serious male singer (Gary
Lightbody of Snow Patrol) who
awkwardly dominates the song.
And as for the country in her
music ... there is no more country
in her music. There is absolutely
no reason, ever, for anyone to clas-
sify T-Swift in the country cat-
egory anymore. She has officially
crossed the thin glittered line into
non-country territory. A lone banjo
in the title track a country record
does not make.
You have to hand it to her: At this
point, Swift certainly isn't lack-
ing in the experience department.
Girl has loved, girl has lost and girl
has written a crapload of hit songs
about it. But come on now - this
is her fourth album spinning the
same tired wheel. We get it. Break-
ups are hard, relationships can be
tangly (especially when it's pour-
ing rain) and it's good to be pissed
off sometimes.
These components work for
Taylor Swift; they are her bread
and butter, the very foundation
upon which her fans worship her.
And honestly, would you really
change your formula if your album
was projected to sell a million cop-
ies in its first week?

Ready or not, world -

choose as his theme song). Regard-

sinkhole for the past few months
(or an'N Sync-hole, for those stuck
in the past few decades), I'm sure
you're aware that we'll all be hear-

"Spoiler alert.20/20Vol2comes

not the most lucid album-release
announcement in recent memory,
but Questlove nonetheless offered
the above response to a New York
Times article Saturday, and it has
since been confirmed. Which
means, well, if we're lucky, we
probably won't stop talking about
JT until Blue Ivy finally finishes
that debut we've been expecting.
I respect Justin Timberlake
more than anything else. The guy
is a consistent pop hit-maker, one
who managed to claw his way
out of the wreckage of 'N Sync's
eventual demise to become one of
biggest names in contemporary
music. And even in a vacuum, the
man still managed to cop a feel
from Janet Jackson on live tele-
vision, in front of the largest TV
audience there is - and that was

before he decided to bring Sexy
Back.
So no, though I've been in a bit
of a bashing mood lately, I'll do no
such thing to the guy - rather, Im
actually keenly interested. How
is Justin from'N Sync now such a
revered, jack-of-all-trades celeb-
rity?
The super-fans among you
might be screaming "The Mickey
Mouse Club" - but if so, please
stop, I'm sure you're disturbing
your neighbors. And you're only
partly right anyway. Justin did
co-star on "The Mickey Mouse
Club" with Britney Spears, Chris-
tina Aguilera, Ryan Gosling and
eventual bandmate JC Chasez
(which of these things is not like
the others, right?). Without any
"Club," Justin would've never
been recruited (along with JC) by
legendary boy-band manager Lou
Pearlman. The rest, as they say, is
history.
Even some of the more casual
Justin fans know the story, the
eye-popping Disney show lineup
and rise to fame. But there's also
a lot of Justin that doesn't neces-
sarily reach the public eye, or that
we've just sort of forgotten about
along the way (and yes, this did
involve researching Justin Tim-
berlake at the library for an hour;
I don't need your judgment).
For instance, I have to admit
that JT seems like a cool dude;
what with his recent induction
into "SNL" 's five-timers club as
one of the better "SNL" hosts of
the decade. The guy made "Dick
in a Box." Even I would go hang
out with the superstar if invited
- it seems like it would be a blast.
Except that, well, I don't know
how much of that image to trust.
I like to hope that, maybe with
maturation, this isn't the same
guy who wrote and performed the
McDonald's anthem "I'm Lovin'
It," and later claimed, "I love what

McDonald's is doingwiththe new
'I'm Lovin' It' campaign ... We
share the same crowd - people
who like to have fun." Clearly, he
doesn't eat at fast-food chains;
I've never seen anything close to
"fun" at a McDonald's. But from
Disney, to boy band, to McDon-
ald's, who's to say that the public
gets an accurate, un-modified
view of the star? How do we know
we're notgettingsold?
But even the details of his
personal life sound so perfectly
vulnerable and simultaneous-
ly cool. Satisfying the obvious
first requirement for being an
"awesome celebrity" (giving to
charity), Timberlake donates
to children's hospitals, wildlife
foundations, arts foundations -
you name it. And yet, he owns a
stake in the Memphis Grizzlies
basketball team, showing us that
he both has a healthy interest in
sports and supports the town he
grew up in.
Damn. It's hard to find fault
with the man. Even his (pur-
ported) dating record reads like
a list of Esquire's sexiest women:
Britney Spears, Cameron Diaz,
Scarlett Johansson and finally
Jessica Biel. And in his spare
time he even once accompanied
U.S. Marine Kelsey De Santis to
the United States Marine Corps
birthday ball, just for the sake of
asking him. That is a classy move,
my friends.
So I guess the guy is perfect.
Yes, he's ruthless in his pursuit of
fame, but which successful stars
aren't? Realistically, the only flaw
with JT's record is his low number
of solo releases - just three as of
The 20/20 Experience. And we all
know that's bound to change.
In summary ... prepare yourself
for the Era of Timberlake.

A$AP Rocky and DJ Dillon Francis discuss
mtvU Woodie Awards, legacies and swag

a

By ANDREW ECKHOUS
Daily Arts Writer
MARCH 15, 2013 - Apparently,
a dungeon exists somewhere in
MTV's studios, somewhere that
still plays music. Known as mtvU,
the television network targets
college students and broadcasts a
variety of programs about things
that we care about, like activism
(obviously) and cool robot music.
All jokes aside, mtvU panders
more convincingly than most
other corporate shills. It spon-
sors Fulbright Scholars and has
a number of opportunities that
involve college students. But the
opportunities aren't exclusively
for service, though, and the mtvU
Woodie Awards exemplify just
that.
Billed as an award show for

"the best in indie, underground
and everything in between," the
mtvU Woodie Awards allow col-
lege students (like you and me!)
to make the decisions, and most
of the nominees are acts that don't
get much love from the main-
stream shows.
Recently, The Michigan Daily
took part in a Woodie Awards
conference call with DJ Dillon
Francis and rapper A$AP Rocky,
in which both artists talked about
their craft, their rising popularity
and what the awards nominations
mean to them.
Francis was first known for his
forays into moombahton, a Latin-
infused brand of electronic music.
Soon after, he signed to Diplo's
Mad Decent label and has seen
his notoriety grow since being
anointed an "artist to watch" by

MTV's electronic music show,
Clubland. Nominated for "Break-
ing Woodie" (Best New Artist,
for you squares out there), Fran-
cis considers a Woodie win as an
achievement, but only a tempo-
rary one.
"If I win it, I think it will be
really cool ... but, for me, I'm just
going to keep doing what I'm
doing and keep making music that
I really love, and that's it," he said.
While many of Francis's
dreams have already come true,
like working with DJ Calvin Har-
ris, he won't let such success go
to his head. From a hardworking
family in Los Angeles, Francis
often describes his unyielding
work ethic and seems serious
about sitting atop the throne of
EDM (electronic dance music)
one day. He's "aiming for 10,000

hours (of work)" by next year, and
with his debut album on the way,
Francis could be a big name for
years to come.
Back for the second year in a
row, Harlem's A$AP Rocky took a
step forward this year. Last year,
A$AP performed and earned
a nomination for "Breaking
Woodie," but this year, he's up for
"Woodie of the Year" as the odds-
on favorite.
A$AP's flavor of New York rap
contains a shot of Houston siz-
zurp, and the hype surrounding
him has been growing ever since
he signed a 3-million dollar con-
tract with Sony in late 201. Like
Francis, success means more to
A$AP than any award.
"Coming up to me and telling

pies, A$AP displays tremendous
business savvy as well. When
A$AP Rock asked what he's bought with his
money so far, he yelled "not a

the money is an investment in his
back hippie career. He considers himself "the

power. rise to fame, it seems like he might
be right.
A$AP wouldn't mind some

The Michigan Daily - michigandailycom Tuesday, September 3, 2013 - 5D

JAN. 17, 2013 - "Believe it
or not - I've come to believe
at this age - human beings are
basically the lowest animals
on this earth, and the reason
why I say that is because I
know that human beings don't
feel that way," OyamO said.
A prominent influence in
the growing canon of African-
American literature, play-
wright OyamO's (Charles F.
Gordon) work captures his-
torical events in a new light.
"All writers have their own
reasons for writing. For me, I
think I want to go for some-
thing that causes discomfort.
But discomfort towards some-
thing good," he said.
Born in Ohio in 1943 and
raised with six siblings,
OyamO recognized his love
for writing at an early age. As
a child, he learned the best
way to express his feelings
and opinions about a particu-
lar individual or issue was
through writing. During high
school, OyamO was known for
writing letters to the editor of

his local newspaper regard-
ing his opinions about issues
in his community, politics
and controversial topics, all
of which were published in
print.
His growing desire to delve
into fiction originated from
his grandfather, a preacher at
the community church.
"I had always enjoyed the
stories that my grandfather
would tell us about the old
days in the South," OyamO
said. "In school, I always
enjoyed the English and lit-
erature courses and soon, I
got to a point when I began
to enjoy writing my own sto-
ries."
An associate professor in
the School of Music, The-
atre & Dance and writer-in-
residence at the University,
OyamO received his Master
of Fine Arts from the Yale
School of Drama. His writ-
ing focuses on the struggles
of people of color in America,
especially those whose voices
are often ignored by society.
His plays bring forth contro-
versial topics in politics, race
and societal classes.
"We have religion, we have
technology, we have all of
these things - and yet here
we are," OyamO said. "We
fight each other over terri-
tory, over natural resources,
over religion, over ethnicity. I
mean, we have weapons right
now that could wipe out all of
humanity. And then you have
to ask yourself, 'Why do they
say that we are the highest
animals on earth?' I say, 'high
on what?"'

Many of OyamO's plays focus on controversial issues like race and war,

OyamO's plays have
appeared on stages across
the country. Some of his best-
known works include "Selfish
Sacrifice," "The White Black
Man," "City in a Strait" and
"Sing Jubilee."
His most celebrated
achievements as an eminent
playwright include the 1999
Eric Kocher Playwrights
Award for "The White Black
Man" at the Eugene O'Neill
Theater Center's National
Playwrights Conference of
1998. OyamO was also award-
ed a PEW/TCG Playwright-
in-Residence Fellowship in
2000 at the Philadelphia The-
atre Company.
OyamO has helped pave
the road for what is becoming
a new theatrical genre with
work that, according to some
critics, can disturb even the

bookstores a try

most impervious audience
members.
"A man is a man, a woman
is a woman and a child is a
child," Oyamo said. "It's very
disturbing to see how these
differences separate us and
make us violent towards each
other."
"We have knowledge, tech-
nology, the ability to explore
the universe," he said. "Then
what are we fighting each
other for? You would think
that by now, we'd figure out
how to live on this earth
together."
"When I retire, I want to
devote my full time to deal-
ing with issues like these
in such a way as to provoke
thinking about it all, because
again, this is the only home
we have."

The first book I ever bought
at Dawn Treader was
"Dostoevsky" by Nicholas
Berdyaev. When I
found it, or rather
when it found me,
I had never even
heard of Berdyaev,
but I couldn't be
happier. During
my senior year of
high school, I took JOHN
a lot of interest in BOHN
Dostoevsky. His
existential treat-
ment of Christian-
ity served to guide me through what
was then my vague, liberal Protes-
tantism. In "Dostoevsky," Berdyaev
articulated what he thought were the
main themes of Dostoevsky's work,
and I consumed the book quickly.
Unlike many, that was how I spent
my freshman year's welcome week. I
don't know exactly howI would view
the book and its ideas today - I have
yet to reread it - but what I won't ever
forget was that rush of excitement
I experienced when I thought I had
found the book I needed to be reading
at this time in my life.
I love browsing bookstores. The
prospect of finding what you didn't
set out to find, of coming across
the unexpected, provides me with
a secret thrill. This past summer, I
experienced that rush of excitement
again. I sat down in one of the chairs
at Dawn Treader, and when I looked
in front of me at the shelf, there sat
"The Rise of Eurocentrism: Anatomy
of Interpretation" by Vassilis Lamb-
ropoulos, a professor at the Univer-
sity. I don't know why this book was
there (especially a practically new
hardcover copy), but it was. For many
reasons, it seemed as if this was the
book I needed to read. I hadn't heard
of it, nor had I ever really looked at
that shelf before, the one where gen-
eral history meets conspiracy theory
books.
At the time, I didn't have the suf-
ficient background to fully under-
stand what it discussed, and while I
probably still won't understand all
the references ranging from the Ref-
ormation to Derrida, that excitement
rushed over me. Having just come out
of a course on Samuel Beckett, and in
a crisis over the question of interpre-
tation, this booked seemed to offer
some light.
Obviously, there are plenty of other
opportunities by which I could have
attempted to reconcile my anxieties
about interpretation; feel free to write

me off as a mystic for defending this
one. There's definitely room for that
interpretation. Or call it a gambler's
addiction, if you fancy. Nevertheless,
I cherish the experience of walking
into an old bookstore and letting my
mind wander. For this reason, I find
myself sensitive to the possibility of
losing this experience.
Businesses come and go in Ann
Arbor; every student has a different
memory of the city. The welcoming
signs of old State Street businesses
hung overhead my Freshman year
while construction workers bus-
ily reminded us that things were
changing. During my experiences in
Ann Arbor, bookstores seem to have
been most affected. I never got a
chance to check out the famous Sha-
man Drum; I only ever saw the sign
hanging above the door leading into
its gutted-out insides. Borders and
Dave's Books, two bookstores close to
campus, closed within my first year
in Ann Arbor. These places I went to
during my freshman year no longer
existed by the end.
So I'm a mystic, and now you have
the opportunity to call me a luddite or
a cultural conservative after the fol-
lowing: Part of me laments what the
Internet has done to browsing cul-
ture. Looming in the background, the
cheaper alternative of Amazon ruins
the browsing culture experience.
Now I buy books because I've been
told I need them. Chance encounters
with new knowledge no longer slip
through the cracks; my life and my
readings now all have a purpose and
isn't it wonderful?
Certainly Amazon and other sites
have chipped away at these book-
store's profits. No one would deny
that. I don't know if this column
makes a good enough case, but I real-
ly encourage those reading to look
at next semester's reading lists and
head over to Dawn Treader, West End
Books and Common Language among
others and see if they have the book
you need. Who knows - they might!
And I make this argument especially
today because we have coming to our
community a new bookstore, Literati.
True, the bookstore sits a little bit off
campus, but the trek out there would
really make a difference.
And even if you don't have a par-
ticular book in mind, check it out
anyway. You'll never know what you
didn't know unless you step in and
see.

It's not always obvious what
a show will do after taking as
big a risk as "Game of Thrones"
did in its season one finale. It's
now safe to say that the HBO
fantasy-drama has success-
fully maintained a high level of
excitement and suspense after
killing off the one hope that
Westeros had.
Season two continued the
battle of the Seven Kingdoms,
introducing new players Theon
Greyjoy and Stannis Baratheon
to fight for control against fan
favorites like Robb Stark and

Daenerys Targaryen. In addi-
tion to the new faces, depth was
added to existing characters
Arya Stark and Tyrion Lan-
nister - both impossibly more
badass than before.
Though the landscape seems
sprawling, "Game of Thrones"
kept us afloat among the details
with vivid storytelling and
visuals.
And though it seemed impos-
sible, season two has made us
all hate Joffrey Baratheon more
than ever before.

Ocean has fashioned a record
that requires effort for under-
standing - a record that doesn't
get assigned as background noise
to energize a teenager's party
(hence the unvarnished produc-
tion of its tracks to highlight his
lyrical artistry).
And there is a great deal to
highlight on Channel Orange.
Ocean understands that quality
lyricism and sentiment aren't born
from sugarcoated, Shakespearean
poetry transformed into song. The
essence of each track is derived

from reality - Ocean's reality, of
substance over form. Anything,
from his early life to love life, is
fair game.
InOcean'sLosAngeleslife,"the
maids come around too much,
parents ain't around enough."Any
other modern R&B artist would
gloat about how he has the cash
flow for a maid, and she's so fine
from behind.

Few movies were antici-
pated in 2012 the way "Django
Unchained" was. Thankfully,
even fewer movies were able to
deliver on the hype the way
"Django" did. Quentin Taran-
tino is at his best, as the film
features violence galore coupled
with sharp, intelligent dialogue.
The story's compelling, the shots
are beautiful, the characters are
engaging and the soundtrack fits
the film perfectly, even if it is
a little unorthodox (c'mon, the
guy put Rick Ross in a western -
RICK ROSS!).

As promised, the all-star cast
of Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz
and Leonardo DiCaprio is phe-
nomenal. Foxx is transformed
into one of the all-time greatest
cinematic badasses by the end
of the film. Waltz is as impres-
sive as he was in "Inglourious
Basterds," and DiCaprio is able
to step out of his normal role and
steal most of his scenes as antag-
onist Calvin Candie. Simply put,
this was a great movie.

It's the little things that make
NBC's "Parks and Recreation"
quietly superb: Jean Ralphio, Bert
Macklin's (FBI) guest appearanc-
es, Ron's Tammy terror.
It certainly takes a tremendous
amount of skill, dedication and
heart for a series to so fully shake
off humble beginnings and create
one of the most expertly defined,
lovable ensemble casts to grace
our TVsets inyears.
And the ensemble is what
"Parks" is all about. Where would
Ron be without Leslie's birthday
scavenger hunts and not-so-subtle

matchmaking? Poor Tom would
still be mourning Entertainment
720 without Ben's restrained guid-
ance, Andy and April would be lost
(literally, in Andy's case) without
each other and Garry wouldn't be
Jerrywithouthisexasperatingco-
workers.
Seamlessly blending new
characters, challenges and cam-
paigns, "Parks" is more than a
sitcom. It's a love letter to the
idea that people can make a dif-
ference. And also, bacon.

Beach House is no stranger to
success. The Baltimore duo got
its first taste of indie fame after
releasing Teen Dream in 2010,
a sweet and hazy collection of
songs that gently lulled its lis-
teners and drew in a fan base.
Now, two years later, Bloom is
just as sweet - it's a soft, potent
cultivation of everything Beach
House for which it has already
been known.
Like former hits "Norway" and
"Take Care," tracks like "Myth"
and "Lazuli" are just as quietly

powerful, deeply personal and
haunting: Victoria Legrand's
rich, smoky vocals rise and fall
over hazy guitar chords and key-
board keys, creating a tender,
dreamlike world of oohs, ahhs
and instrumentals.
The album is darker and more
refined than anything the band
has created in the past - it isn't
a reproduction of classic Beach
House sounds and vibes, but liv-
ing proof that the duo itself has
bloomed.
-CHLOE STACHOWIAK

"Argo" is a rollercoaster ride
that you don't want to end.
Even though it's a biopic and
the "What happens?" is no mys-
tery, the captivating question in
this film is: "How the hell did
they pull that off?" Ben Affleck
knocks it out of the park as he
directs and stars in this true
story about CIA agent.Tony
Mendez, who concocts a fake
movie project called "Argo,"
to seek permission for a "loca-
tion scout" in Iran, so he can
smuggle U.S. embassy officials

to safety.
John Goodman and Alan
Arkin are hilarious as a Holly-
wood make-up artist and a pro-
ducer past his prime who help
Tony promote, advertise and
market this faux film.
I laughed, I cried, I gripped
my chair and I thoroughly
enjoyed the dialogue; out of it
came one of the most memorable
phrases of the year. What is it,
you may ask? Go see "Argo" and
you'll know when you hear it.

Michigan's new playmakers Moving to offense of choice

* By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
APRIL 13, 2013 - One is a
freak, the other a runt. Junior
Frank Clark is a274-poundbehe-
moth at defensive end. Fifth-year
senior Jeremy Gallon is a5-foot-8
speedster at receiver.
In stature, the two are oppo-
sites. But with the loss of Michi-
gan's two playmakers from 2012
- Denard Robinson to gradua-
tion and redshirt junior lineback-
er Jake Ryan to injury - each has
become the most exciting player
on the field. And in Saturday's
Spring Game, each was the play-
er to watch on his side of the ball.
Redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner took Gallon to his
church a few weeks ago. A young
fan approached Gallon.
"A little kid walked up and was
like, 'Hey you play high school.
I'm going to high school too!' "
Gardner recalled, laughing. "I
was like, 'Ooh. Gonna have to get
a little bigger, a little taller or lift
or something, you know?"'
Then Gardner introduced
Gallon to the pastor. The pas-
tor didn't recognize Gallon. He
pegged the receiver at 6-foot-3.
"That just speaks a lot for the
way he plays and how tough he
is and how big he actually plays."
Gallon is so short that diminu-
tive senior receiver Drew Dileo
likes to remind the press that at
5-foot-10, Dileo is actually two
inches taller than his teammate.
"Don't let him tell you different-
ly," Dileo says.
But when Robinson went out
with an injury last year, Gal-
lon filled the big-play void. In
Michigan's last five games, with
Gardner as quarterback, Gallon
caught 31 passes for 511yards and
three touchdowns. In the Out-
back Bowl against South Caro-
lina, Gallon hauled in nine passes
for 145 yards and three touch-
downs.
Again on Saturday, Gallon was
Gardner's favorite target. Gal-

- Jaron Dukes from Ohio and

most analysts regarded each as a
three-star recruit.
It's, clear the coaches value
size at receiver - each recruit
checks in at 6-foot-2 or tall-
er - but speed is a question.
Wide receivers coach/recruit-
ing coordinator Jeff Hecklinski
downplayed that aspect of the
position, saying that "speed is
overrated" and that it's difficult
to even determine a recruit's
speed since he likely rarely
touches the ball in high school.
"If you can't catch, we have
issues," Hecklinski said. "All
of our guys, if you watch them
on high-school film, they have
great hands, they adjust to the
ball, they track the ball very well
in the air and they go up and
they catch it.
"We can judge that on film,
so let's get the best hand-eye
coordination guys, guys that
can catch the football, let's bring
them in here and let's develop
them in other areas."
Though the coaches assem-
bled an extremely talented
offensive class, it wasn't nec-
essarily easy. Borges and his
cohorts had to convince recruits
that they'd be playing in a sys-
tem they wanted to play in,
which wasn't necessarily the
spread-hybrid they saw Michi-
gan run for the last two seasons.
"It is hard," Borges said.
"Sometimes you have to go back
and show them stuff you've done
in the past (at other schools)
because they got to see what
you're getting to. ... But we
showed them, and they under-
stood, they know what direction
we want to go in, and that's why
they decided tocome here."
With the 2013 class in tow and

desired offense, it appears the

ing visits will soon be over.

passes for 22 yards, unofficially.
On the other side of the ball,
Clark spent much of the day
lined up against All-American
fifth-year senior tackle Taylor
Lewan. Clark has spent much of
the spring sparring with Lewan
in practice.
On Saturday, he was asked,
again, who typically wins the
battle.
"I've gotten that question so
many times," Clark said with
a smile before saying that the
matchup has been even.
If Gallon, as Gardner said,
plays sneakily big, then Clark
plays sneaky fast. Clark played
safety in high school but added
50 pounds during his time at
Michigan.
Now 274 pounds, Clark hasn't
lost his speed, according to Dileo.
"When you have a D-end
who's probably as fast as some
of your receivers, that classifies
you as a freak," Dileo said. "Just
a monster."
Last vear Clark showed flash-

es of athleticism but struggled
with consistency. He also was
suspended for Michigan's first
game before pleading guilty to
a felony count of second-degree
home invasion. He was arrested
on June 14 for attempting to steal
a laptop from Stockwell Hall.
This year, Clark said he has
looked to seniors like Gardner to
become a better leader. He has
also tried to add consistency to
his playmaking ability.
"I wanted to be that player
who coach Mattison can rely on,"
Clark said. "With one of our key
players, Jake Ryan going down,
I know he's looking for that next
player to step into that new role
and be that player for him, and
that's what I want to be. I want
to be that player he can look and
go, 'I know Frank'sgoing to make
a play.'"
Lewan neutralized Clark for
much of Saturday. But later in
the practice, Clark moved to the
right side of Michigan's line.
The nlav ended in a sack.

Zach Helfand: Dear Denard

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
JAN. 1, 2013 - TAMPA,
Fla. - Even after it was over,
Denard, you made three strang-
ers smile.
After the miracle attempt
failed and the clock ran out
Tuesday, after South Carolina
pulled out a 33-28 victory in the
final seconds, you walked to the
middle of the field and shook
hands.
For once, you didn't smile.
A group of three stadium
staffers approached you with a
camera phone. It was 4:44 p.m.,
two minutes after your career
ended. The pain was still fresh -
you hadn't even made it off the
field. Yet, at your lowest point,
you posed with them for a photo.
One last memory.
Thirty-seven minutes later, at
your press conference, you talk-
ed about memories, sitting on a
black plastic chair in a dim con-
crete alcove beneath Raymond
James Stadium. On the cinder-
block wall above your head, on
laminated paper, someone had
scrawled "16 Robinson" in red
dry-erase marker, as if a remind-
er were necessary. Here, still no
smile, just downcast looks and
shiny glass eyes.
"I want (the fans) to remem-
ber whatever they want to
remember," you said. "The ups
and downs."
They already do. They
remember the little things.
A teacher from western New
York took his friends to their
first Michigan game. It was your
first too. You fumbled a ball and
picked it up and ran for a touch-
down. They've been fans ever
since. *
A law student watched your
freshman year, and at first, he
thought you were just a speedy
athlete. Then he saw the look
on your face after you threw a
game-ending interception at
Iowa. He saw how devastated
you were; he saw how much you

cared too.
Ups and downs.
A sophomore watched your
improbable win over the Irish
twoyears later.Afteryourgame-
winning pass to Roy Roundtree,
he felt like he was swept up in
a wave, like the student sec-
tion had swollen and burst. He
hugged weeping strangers.
Everyone has his own photo-
graph of your career.
The reporters asked questions
about your legacy. You said you
don't know what it should be.
These four years were long
and messy. How do you con-
dense four years into a neat
picture? How do you define a
legacy?
Sometimes your crazy scram-
bles worked. Sometimes they
didn't. But like the law student,
we cared because you cared.
Because you danced with us at
basketball games. Because you
were one of us.
We cared because when there
wasn't much to be excited about,
you supplied the excitement. As
Desmond Howard said of you
Tuesday, "The whole nation,
when they watched him play,
just kind of held their breath."
It was messy, but that's okay.
We don't need to define you. We
have our memories.
As you talked, nearby, your
teammate, Quinton Washing-
ton, described what he'd remem-
ber about your career. It's not
just the plays on the field. It's the
effect you had on people off it.
Just this year, a junior saw
you walking into Angell Hall.
You smiled at everyone as you
held the door for your class-
mates. You told her to have a
good day, and she did.
Last year, a senior sat next
to you at the library. Surely you
don't remember him. But he'll
remember forever. You offered
him a piece of your Kit Kat.
Chin up, Denard, we need
your smile.
But we didn't get the goodbye
right, did we? After four years,

Everett Cook: Bye, Trey

A season for remembering

By EVERETT COOK,
Daily Sports Editor
APRIL 9, 2013 - ATLANTA
- With six minutes left in Michi-
gan's 82-76 loss to Louisville
in the National Championship,
Trey Burke launched himself off
the ground and toward the back-
board, stretching his arm as far
up as it could possibly go, trying
to stop the trajectory of Louisville
guard Peyton Siva.
It was a breakaway play in
transition, one-on-one, point
guard against point guard. Siva
rose up with his right hand, cra-
dling the ball, trying to slam it up
and over Burke.
Any other point guard either
lets Siva go or tries to strip the ball
in the air. Burke tried to block it.
Ninety seconds prior, the soph-
omore point guard had been lying
facedown on the court, trying to
recover after being fouled hard
on a drive. He had been beaten up
all game by the physical Cardinal
defense, and it was starting to
take its toll.
Burke got up and walked to the
free-throw line, head down. Jor-
dan Morgan caught him before
he got to the stripe, telling Burke
to lift his head. Morgan knew his
point guard was hurting. The red-
shirt junior center told him, "Just
keep fighting. Just six more min-
utes."
Burke nodded, but missed the
first free throw. He muttered
something under his breath, took
a breath, stepped forward and
made the second one. He was in
pain.
But in the open court against
Siva, the 6-foot Burke got up high-
er than he had all season. Half of
his forearm was above the rim,
where his hand met nothing but
the ball. It was a clean rejection, a
perfect defensive play and a per-
fect snapshot of two leaders leav-
ing everything on the line.
Then, a whistle. Burke was
called for the foul, and Siva made
both his free throws.

After the game, 11 players and
coaches viere asked if the play
was clean. All 11 said it was, but
all said it ultimately didn't affect
the outcome. There were so many
other plays that swung the game.
All 11 praised the point guard
for being able to even get there.
"If there's one person who
can't hang his head, it's Trey," said
freshman guard Nik Stauskas.
"He's carried us all year long."
There's a story that Michigan
assistant coach LaVall Jordan
likes to tell about Burke.
In the first open gym of Burke's
Michigan career in the summer
of 2011, Jordan approached Burke
and asked him, "You like win-
ning, don't you?" Burke, then 19,
responded, "Coach, I win. That's
what Ido."
Jordan knew that Burke had
won the Ohio State Champi-
onship as a sophomore in high
school, so he laughed andnodded,
trying to humor his young point
guard.
Dead serious, without a glint
of humor, Burke looked up at
Jordan, shook his head and said,
"Coach, I win. That's what I do."
That's not the interesting
part. The interesting part is
that Jordan believed Burke, the
soon to be freshman who hadn't
yet played in a collegiate game.
Jordan could see the drive that
earned Michigan a Big Ten title
last year and brought itsix points
away from a national champion-
ship this year.
Aftertwoyears,AnnArborhas
seen it, probably for the last time
Monday. He almost left last year,
but on April 9, 2012, he said, "I felt
like it was the best decision for me
to stay my sophomore year and
compete for a national champion-
ship next year."
After sweeping the four
major National Player of the
Year awards and getting the
Wolverines to Atlanta, Burke
accomplished what he wanted
to. For him, there's nothing left
to accomplish at Michigan. It's

almost a foregone conclusion he
will play in the NBA next year.
But on Monday, he was still a
Wolverine, and he was still the
best player in the country, still the
player capable of makingshots 30
feet from the basket. Every time
it felt like the game was slipping
away, there was Burke, willing
Michigan back into it.
He finished the contest with a
game-high 24 points while miss-
ing just four shots and tallied six
of Michigan's last 10 points. He
couldn't, wouldn't let his team let
it slip away.
"He's a superhero. A mytho-
logical figure," said senior cap-
tain Josh Bartelstein. "I've never
enjoyed playing with anybody so
much. He's the best basketball
player I've ever played with, and
I've played with some good play-
ers. That kid is going to have an
unbelievable career in the NBA."
It's not a one-man game,
though. With 40 seconds left,
Burke knew Michigan needed to
foul, but also knew he had four of
his own. Manically, he tried wav-
ing freshman guard Caris LeVert
- or anyone he could find - over
to commit the infraction. Nobody
else understood, and time kept
ticking away.Burke's last two shot
attempts fell short.
At 1:42 a.m., a pocket of con-
fetti fell from the rafters, the last
of the celebration. The court was
already being disassembled, the
nets already cut down. The game,
season and career was over.
Trey Burke wins. That's what
he does. On Monday, there was
nothing more he could have done
- he had nothing more to give.
With the seconds ticking
down, Siva walked over to Burke
and gave him a hug, a nod of
respect. He saw what Jordan saw,
back before Burke came onto the
national scene.
Siva knew that there was
no point guard in the country
that could have made that play,
because there was no point guard
in the country like Trey Burke.

MARCH 28, 2013 - It has been
a hell of a season for the Michigan
women's basketball team.
The Wolverines exceeded all
expectations under first-year
coach Kim Barnes Arico. Michi-
gan (9-7
Big Ten, ALEXA
22-11 DETTELBACH
overall)
got off
to a 16-2 O
start - Basketball
best in
program history - during which
time the Wolverines went on a
10-game winning streak, setting
another program record.
Once Big Ten play started,
Michigan set yet another program
record by winning its first four
games. Adding to the accolades,
Barnes Arico led the Wolverines
to a win over No. 13 Purdue in
early February, and later ended a
six-year drought against Michi-
gan State in a close 70-69 win
that ended in dramatic fashion at
Crisler Center on Feb.16.
And if that weren't enough,
Michigan earned its first Associ-
ated Press ranking since 2002 on
Jan. 14 and won its first NCAA
Tournament game since 2001.
This team reached new heights
fans would never have guessed,
especially after an offseason that
cost the Wolverines five players to
ACL injuries.
"When you get a coaching
change, you don't know what to
expect," said senior guard Jenny
Ryan. "I can't explain enough
how much coach (Barnes) Arico
did behind the scenes in April
before this thing even got going,
how much she did for the pro-
gram, especially the seniors.
"She didn't just come in and
throw her style at us, she worked
with us, got to know us as people,
as players and once you realizeethe
amount of effort that was put in,
I'm not surprised by our success."
Barnes Arico has pointed to her
seniors all season as the reason
for the team's success, and right-

fully so. The five seniors, four of
whom started, account for 84 per-
cent of the offense. The 80 wins
make this class the winningest in
school history.
Led by Ryan, Michigan never
lacked leadership. Ryan earned
third-team All-Big Ten honors,
the first time she's been named to
an all-conference team, and aver-
aged 10.2 points per game with
5.2 assists. A leader on and off the
court as the point guard and cap-
tain,Ryanembracedhervocalrole
and became the heart and soul of
the team from the beginning.
"I've coached a lot of really
good point guards in my career
as a coach, and she leads the pack
just because of everything she
does," Barnes Arico said. "She's
the total package. She's a coach's
dream really."
The surprise 'x'-factor for this
Wolverine squad was forward
Kate Thompson - who had never
started a game until this season.
Thompson led the team in points,
averaging 14.5 per game, but it
was her 3-point shooting that
carried her. She set the program
record for most career 3-pointers
as well as 3-pointers in a season.
She ended the season with 110,
becoming only the fifth player in
Big Ten history to hit at least 100
threes in a season.
Thompson garnered second-
team All-Big Ten honors and also
finished the regular season ranked
second in the nation in 3-pointers
per game with 3.4. In Michigan's
second-round NCAA Tourna-
ment loss to Stanford, Thompson
scored just seven points, but it
still brought her past the 1,000-
point mark for her career.
Center Rachel Sheffer, who
led the team in points last sea-
son, averaged 12.8 points and 6.6
rebounds per game this season.
Sheffer proved to be a critical
player for a team that typically ran
three- or four-guard sets, earning
an honorable mention from the
Big Ten. Her experience and poise
set her apart from the start in the

locker room. On Jan. 21, Sheffer
scored her 1,000th career point.
Another pleasant surprise
from the seniors was forward
Nya Jordan, who worked her
way into the starting lineup once
conference play began. Jordan,
whose specialty had always been
defense, worked on her shot and
ended up averaging 8.5 points per
game, while leading the team in
rebounds with 7.5 per game. The
Detroit native alsoearned an hon-
orable mentionfromthe BigTen.
As the only senior who didn't
start, forward Sam Arnold made
sure her presence was known
when she entered off the bench.
Arnold averaged 5.2 points per
game and led the team in field-
goal percentage, hitting 53.2 per-
cent of her shots. She was by far
the most productive bench player
for the Wolverines, who spent
most of their time in a six-player
rotation.
With a Michigan team so
dependent on its seniors, Barnes
Arico's squad will be starting
over next year, allowing her to put
her stamp on the team. Retain-
ing only one starter, sophomore
forward Nicole Elmblad, Barnes
Arico will need help from her
incoming freshmen class as well
as huge contributions from fresh-
man guard Madison Ristovski.
Ristovski was expected to play
a major role this season, but the
success of the seniors put her on
the bench.
"Any time you don't win a
national championship, you're
goingto end your season on a sour
note," Barnes Arico said. "They're
a special group, and we talked
about it all week. I feel honored to
be their coach, and the transition
has been so great."
Despite an early exit from the
NCAA Tournament, the Wol-
verines' accomplishments went
beyond expectations. Since the
opener against Detroit - back on
Nov. 9 - this had the potential to
be a season worth remembering.
And it was.

A look ahead: Breaking down the 2013-14 Wolverines

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
APRIL 22, 2013 - Since the day
Trey Burke decided to return to
Ann Arbor for his sophomore sea-
son, the 2012-13 Michigan men's
basketball team was expected to
contend for a Final Four. It didn't
disappoint, either, remaining in
the nation's top 10 for the entire
season and eventually reaching
its goal in Atlanta.
Though Burke and junior
guard Tim Hardaway Jr. have
since departed in favor of the
NBA Draft, freshmen forwards
Mitch McGary and Glenn Rob-
inson III chose to follow Burke's
lead and stay for their sophomore
seasons. Their decisions, along
with another top-flight recruit-
ing class, position the Wolverines
for another Big Ten title and Final
Four hunt.
Despite the departure of
Burke and Hardaway, Michigan
essentially returns four starters
- McGary started each game in
the NCAA Tournament, while
redshirt junior forward Jordan
Morgan started nearly the entire
regular season after holding the
starting post spot throughout the
previous two seasons.
The Daily broke downthe Wol-
verines' upcoming roster, posi-
tion by position:
Point guard: When Burke
picked up two quick fouls in the
championship game against Lou-
isville, freshman Spike Albrecht

filled in more than admirabl
netting 17 points on 4-of-4 shooi
ing from 3-point range. In the set
and half, everyone was reminde

one who hit just four 3-pointers i
his 18 appearances during confer
ence play.
Albrecht should see a rise h

game average last season, an
as he showed in the Final Foui
his shooting touch gives him th
capability to score in bunches, bu
he'll likely play in another reserv
role. Albrecht will probably b

Wolverines open their season h
November, but like Matt Vogric
this year, he'll likely accept
diminished role in favor of incon
ing freshman Derrick Walton J
as the non-conference slate pro
gresses.
Walton, a Detroit native, i
the nation's No. 37 recruit -
good for the eighth-best poin
guard - according to Rivals.com
which tabbed Michigan's incon
ing class at No. 12, second in th
Big Ten behind Indiana. Walton
like Burke, is undersized - eac
stands at 6-feet tall - but is laud
ed for his passing and shootin
abilities. His defense remains
question mark, but on offense
he's consistently been tabbed a
a "true point guard" who coul
flourish in a Wolverine offens
loaded with a wealth of scorin
options.

Y, Bottom line: No matter how
t- well Walton or Albrecht play,
- this position will be a downgrade
d from the consensus National
't Player of the Year, who played
e more than 35 minutes per game.
h Inexperience could hamper Wal-
- ton early on, but when given time
to jell with all of his surrounding
n talent, Walton should be able to
r facilitate another dangerously
d talented Michigan offense.
r, Wing: Hardaway's offensive
e production can be replaced, but
t can his defense? After being a
e defensive liability for most of
e his first two seasons, Hardaway
e turned into one of the Wolver-
n ines' most reliable perimeter

a opposition's top outside threat.

ing more lineups with two big
men on the floor at the same time,
s which would allow Robinson to

a, sized power forward role he
- played for most of his freshman

d on the perimeter or post up small-
e er defenders, while his ability to
g find space in transition is as good
as anyone in the country.
Freshman guard Nik Stauskas
isn'tthe porous defender he was at
the start of the conference season,
but he'll still benefit greatly from
another offseason of strength and
conditioning, as well as coaching.
Combined with Robinson on the
wing, the Wolverines are already
i looking at a formidable one-two
punch, but perhaps the team's top
wingman next season, incoming
freshman Zak Irvin, hasn't even
graduated high school.
The five-star product, Indi-
ana's 2012-13 Mr. Basketball, is
Rivals.com's No. 24 prospect.
At 6-foot-6, his measurables are
similar to Hardaway, but he pos-
sesses greater ball-handling skills
and an impressive knack for get-
ting to the basket or creating his

own shot, which is solid.
With so much top-heavy tal-
ent, it's easy to forget freshman
guard Caris LeVert, who wasn't
even a Wolverine commitment
at this time last year. LeVert's
6-foot-5 frame was so scrawny
that coaches quickly decided to
redshirt him, but they quickly
changed their course when his
play in practice was too good
to keep off the floor. LeVert is a
superb perimeter defender who
has flashed an ability to shoot and
rebound. His body should benefit
tremendously from a full offsea-
son in a collegiate strength and
conditioning program.
Bottom line: Hardaway took
the basketball program to a new
level, but Michigan has a wealth
of riches on the wing that might
make forgetting Hardaway easy
by the middle of next season. The
top-four contributors here can
score in a variety of ways, both in
transition and in half-court sets,
and despite the loss of Hardaway,
should even provide an upgrade
on the defensive end with Robin-
son playing at small forward.
Post: While Michigan will
certainly miss Burke, McGary's
departure could've rivaled
Burke's in terms of setting the
programback.With the freshman
in Ann Arbor for another season,
the Wolverines have their entire
frontcourtback, which should set
fear into opposing coaches.
McGary averaged 6.2 points
and 5.1 rebounds in under 20
minutes per game during confer-
ence play last season, mostly off
the bench, but took the nation
by storm after a promotion into
the starting lineup to kick off the
NCAA Tournament. In over 30
minutes per game, he averaged a
double-double, dominating some
of the country's best post men,
including Kansas' Jeff Withey.
McGary was admittedly out of
shape and wasn't eating right
until the middle of the season
and should build upon a better
conditioning and eating regimen
with another college offseason
program. In the tournament, he
reminded everyone why he was
once ranked as the nation's No.
2 recruit, and he should only get
better next year.

ADAM:
Sophomore guard Trey Burke's athleticism and offense will beto



But the frontcourt doesn't end
with McGary. Earlier this week,
Michigan coach John Beilein
indicated that he'd use two big
men on the floor at the same time
for at least significant portions of
games, something .he has done
very little of during his tenure in
Ann Arbor. The days of the Wol-
verines getting absolutely abused
in the post ended this past season,
but Michigan still struggled with
post-oriented teams like Michi-
gan State. That should change in
the upcoming year.
Morgan is a three-year starter
but never seemed to fully recover
from a midseason ankle injury. A
healthy Morgan - one of the con-
ference's top low-post defenders
- alongside a still-developing Jon
Horford, gives the Wolverines
three solid post players. Incom-
ing forward Mark Donnal, who
fell just outside the nation's top-
100 prospects, could challenge
for playtime, and redshirt fresh-
man Max Bielfeldt can provide a
reliable few minutes per game if
needed, as well.
Bottom line: McGary flashed
All-American potential in the
NCAA Tournament, and assum-

ing he doesn't regress, Michigan
should actually be able to consis-
tently outmuscle Big Ten teams
in the post - something it hasn't
been ableto do in years. While the
Wolverines won't always employ
a two-post man lineup, they'll
certainly have the option to.
So what does this all mean?
Burke had the talent to win
games all by himself, and he did
so countless times. While he'll
be missed, Michigan will have a
combination of talent and depth
it hasn't had since at least the Fab
Five years. Beilein has proven his
wizardry time and time again
when it comes to adjusting his
system to his lineup, and that
could shine through this year
like never before. The Wolverines
have so many offensive options
- playing two bigs, going small,
pushing the pace, playing in the,
half court - that their offense
shouldn't skip a beat once Walton
gains some experience.
Defense will again be the ques-
tion mark, but with the ability to
play two men in the post, oppos-
ing teams won't be able to exploit
a weakness down low like they
could in years past.

that had been in this situation
before, the team that knew how to
close out big games in the fourth
set. Trailing 10-9, the Wolverines
put together a 5-0 run, leaving
Stanford looking drained.
Leading 15-13, Michigan
needed one final run to crush
any thought of a comeback in the
fourth set. The Wolverines did so
with a 4-0 run, which ultimately
allowed them to cruise to a match
point, which Erwin finished off
with an emphatic kill.'
The Wolverines, the team that
wasn't predicted to be celebrat-
ing, celebrated. They smiled as
they had all season, as even the
coaches knew they had accom-
plished somethingspecial.
Freshman libero Tiffany
Morales, playing in front of
friends and family in her home
state, bailed out Michigan when
it needed her most. The Redondo
Beach, Calif. native tallied 22 digs
on a night where she was all over
the court. Erwin, too, found her-
self doing more than hitting, con-
tributing16 digs of her own.
"Tiffany's progression has

been great," Rosen said. "I
thought last night she did an out-
standing job of just positioning
herself and making great defen-
sive plays, and she definitely car-
ried that through tonight."
Dannemiller, who continues
to be a catalyst for a team that
wasn't supposed to have a variety
of options to passto, finished with
59 of her team's 66 assists on the
night.
"Our setter, I thought tonight,
set one of the best matches I've
seen her set in her career," Rosen
said. "She put our hitters in great
positions and made great deci-
sions throughout the match that
really allowed us to be successful."
It's likely Michigan, a team
without a real star, will once again
be underdogs when it travels to
Louisville to face Texas.
But that underdog mindset
doesn't exist anymore.
"It doesn't matter because
we're such a great team," Erwin
said. "We don't need our names
out there because no matter what
teams throw at us, 14 people are
coming at them."

MARCH 31, 2013 - With
the NCAA title finally in hand,
it was time for Michigan head
coach Mike Bottom to have
some fun of his own. Adorned
in a plaid maize-and-blue shirt,
a blue tie emblazoned with Wol-
verines and dark brown pants,
Bottom leaped off the starting
blocks and into the diving pool,
joining the celebration of the
newly crowned Michigan men's
swimmingteam.
"It's definitely time to cel-
ebrate," Bottom said. "This
team has worked hard all year
at every meet and has swam fast
since they got off on the block.
They swam fast all throughout
the season, and they got here
and kept swimming fast."
The meet spanned from
Thursday to Saturday at IU
Natatorium in Indianapolis -
the exact location the Wolver-
ines won their last title in 1995.
"We have a lot of great alum-
ni that have sent me pictures
of them swimming around in
that pool," Bottom said, with a
chuckle, in his press conference.
"And we put some of those pic-
tures up and had some of them
come in and talk to us about that
feeling."
With preparation, poise and
perhaps alittle luck, the Wolver-
ines were ready to make their
run at a title.
The quartet of sophomore
Bruno Ortiz, graduate student
Zachary Turke, and seniors
Sean Fletcher and Miguel Ortiz
got Michigan its first points of
the meet, placing third in the
200-yard freestyle relay. The
Wolverines would finish the
night with another third-place
finish in the 400-yard medley
relay event, as the quartet of
Miguel Ortiz, sophomore Rich-
ard Funk, Fletcher, and Bruno
Ortiz clocked in at 3:04.73, set-
tinga school record.
Michigan's onlywinof the day
came by way of junior Connor
Jaeger in the 500-yard freestyle,
who became the fifth Wolverine
ever to win the event. Jaeger had
won the event outright for Mich-
igan throughout the season, usu-
ally leading the race right from
the start. His record looked to
be in danger though, as Texas'
Michael McBroom wouldn't
allow Jaeger any separation. At
the 150-yard mark, Jaeger finally
made his move,holding off McB-
room for the event win, helping
Michigan take the day one lead
with 153 points.
The second day followed a
similar script, with the Wolver-
ines' relay teams making head-
lines. In the first event final of
the night, the quartet of Miguel
Ortiz, Bruno Ortiz, Fletcher
and Turke took first-place in
the 200-yard medley relay with
a time of 1:22.27, setting new
NCAA, U.S. Open, NCAA Cham-
pionship and school records.
The win also marked the first
time a Michigan relay team has
won a national title in the NCAA

Championship's 76-year history.
"We started out with one
recruiting class that we were
scrambling with because we
came in late," Bottom said at his
press conference. "And these are
the guys, you know, we had four
of them on that relay that broke
the national record and it's awe-
some to see."
The Wolverines also received
significant contributions from
Fletcher and Funk, both plac-
ing third in the 100-yard butter-
fly and 100-yard breaststroke,
respectively. With a second-
place finish in the 800-yard
freestyle relay, the team of
junior Michael Wynalda, Jaeger,
freshman Anders Nielsen and
redshirt junior Hassaan Khalik
helped Michigan end the night
in first place with 336 points.
"We didn't have a real confi-
dence that we would win this,"
Bottom said to ESPN on March
30. "By the second day, I looked
at our team and I said, 'Alright,
we've gotten in the top three,
now what do you want to do?'
They looked at me like I was
crazy. They looked at me and
said, 'We came here to win."'
And with Jaeger's first-place
finish in the 1,650-yard freestyle,
Michigan inched ever closer to
a national championship. With
the event win, Jaeger became
the first swimmer for Michigan
to win two individual events
since Tyler Clary - a gold med-
alist in this summer's Olympics
- accomplished the feat in 2009.
And surely enough, the Wol-
verines rounded out the event
with a second-place finish in
yet another relay. With a time
of 2:50.18, Miguel Ortiz, Turke,
Fletcher and Bruno Ortiz
ensured Michigan 34 points and
a National Championship.
"We never took our eyes off
the big show, but we went into
every meet and we wanted to
win, and we swam fast all year:
swam fast in dual meets, swam
fast in conference and we kept
getting better," aeger said. "We
kept believing, we kept follow-
ing the program we have set,
and this is a team fueled by pas-
sion. ... Passion for Michigan."
The title marks the 12th in the
history of Michigan swimming
and diving, but perhaps more
importantly, its recent triumph
breaks a tie between the Wolver-
ines and Buckeyes for the most
all-time championships. And to
top it all off, coach Bottom was
named Coach of the Year at the
culmination of the meet.
At the end, with his players
still celebrating in the pool, Bot-
tom sat alone on the side of the
pool, finallytaking it all in.
The Wolverines finished the
season with an 8-0 overall and
6-0 Big Ten record, but Bottom
said the team needed to push
on for Big Ten Championships.
When Michigan won its third
straight Big Ten Championship,
Bottom said the team needed to
keep swimming fast for NCAAs.
But now, with a NCAA title
under his belt, Bottom is finally
ready to celebrate.


Men's Gymnastics wins Championship

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
APRIL 21, 2013 - Going into
'W the final rotation of the NCAA
national championship Saturday
night, the Michigan men's gym-
nastics team held a half-point lead
over Oklahoma with only its floor
routine to go. But while the Soon-
ers and the other four teams were
anxiously waiting to begin their
last event rotations, the Wolver-
ines couldn't help but smile.
No. 3 Michigan (7-1 Big Ten,
27-2 overall) was up on the floor,
where it ranks first in the nation,
and knew it was only a rotation
away fromwinningthe program's
fifth national championship.
But the anticipation of winning
wasn't the only thing bringing
smiles to the Wolverine bench.
Junior Sam Mikulak was up by
2.95 points in the all-around com-
petition over his teammate, soph-
omore Adrian de Los Angeles. So
with first and second place locked
up in the all-around, a huge floor
routine was all that stood in
Michigan's way to a team title.
The Wolverines did more than
rise to the occasion on their floor
exercise, where they scored an
event-high 75.250, which gave
them a 443.200-440.100 blowout
over the second-place Sooners.

It's been 29 years since a team
won the NCAA team title by more
than three points.
"I knew we could score higher
on floor then Oklahoma could on
high bar, we just had to hit our
sets," said Michigan coach Kurt
Golder. "But it can happen where
one guy misses, then the next guy,
then the next guy, and it can be
really hard to get it turned around.
"We didn't have it clinched
(and) even though we had the
pressure on us, the guys were
ready for it and handled it really
well."
Michigan's success on floor
also kept Mikulak in the lead for
the all-around championship,
wherehe ultimatelyedged out Los
Angeles with a career-best 91.150.
It's Mikulak's second all-around
title in three years, and the pairs'
1-2 finish for the all-around is the
first time teammates have done
that since the 1980s.
"Mikulak is special because of
his unselfishness," Golder said.
"Every interview that he has, he
just talks about how he didn't
have personal goals and (that)
everything was for the team. He
kept saying all he wanted was to
get one or two in the all-around
no matter the order, (just) as long
as it went to Michigan.
"He just wanted the team to

win, and that approach was really
great - just get out there and be
the best."
All in all, it was a storybook
weekend for the Wolverines, who
started out as well as they finished.
In the NCAA Qualifier on Fri-
day afternoon, the top 12 teams
in the nation competed for six
spots in the team finals Saturday.
Michigan needed to place in the
top three of its session in order to
advance, and the Wolverines set
the tone early, ultimately grab-
bing first place in their session.
Last season, Michigan also fin-
ished in the top spot in their ses-
sion but ultimately ended up in
last place after Saturday, so the
Wolverines knew they couldn't
let their early success leadcto over-
confidenceheadingintothe finals.
"Last year's problems really
helped us to get there this year,"
Golder said. "I mean, just about
the whole team was there last
year so that experience just
helped everyone this year.
"After we won our session last
year in the prelims, we were cel-
ebrating, but this year it was just
as usual and we had a 'We're not
done' mentality. So that really is
experience and maturation as a
competitor."
Friday, Michigan scored
70-plus points on all six events,
but its performance on the par-
allel bars stole the show on the
first day of competition, scoring
a season-best 75.90. All three
Wolverine competitors broke the
personal 15-barrier, with senior
Syque Caesar leading the way
with his 15.60.
This time, Michigan's expe-
rience stood out in every event
Saturday. The confidence Golder
had in his team was reflected by
his decision to start the meet off
on championship Saturday with
pommel horse, widely considered
the hardest of the six events. The
Wolverines scored their third-
highest mark of the season, hit-
ting an event-high 72.250.
Michigan moved onto the
rings, where it had a terrific sec-
ond rotation. Junior Alex Bubnov
went first and set a career-high
15.25, followed by junior Jor-
dan Gaarenstroom, who also hit
a career best with his monster
15.600-point performance.

From there, the Wolverines
made everything look easy. Miku-
lak took on his best event, the high
bar, where he scored a15.650. Sat-
urday night's podium was filled
with maize and blue, but it didn't
end there for Michigan, which
continued its dominance Sunday.
Eight Wolverines qualified for
individual finals, and five came
out with spots on the podium. In
addition, gymnasts who finish in
the top eight in individual events
are awarded All-American status
- Michigan tied a program high
with 13.
Like the rest of the weekend,
Mikulak led the way on Sunday,
earning individual titles in high
bar and parallel bar, while grab-
bing third place on floor. The
13-time All-American and five-
time NCAA champion's high-bar
performance was so dominant
that he notched more then a point
higher than the next closest com-
petitor and scored a weekend-
high 16.100.
"I honestly don't think I have
(had a better weekend)Miua

said. "Olympic trials were defi-
nitely really exciting for me, but
overall for this entire weekend, I
didn't miss a single routine. It just
kind of felt easy going with the
flow, I'm just real pleased with
how I did."
In addition to Mikulak's
achievements, Caesar got second
on the parallel bars and third on
the high bar. He also tied with
teammate senior Rohan Sebas-
tian for fourth on floor.
The Wolverines not only
earned the team title, the all-
around title and two individual
titles, but it also won the Big Ten
championship two weeks ago.
The Big Ten proved to be no cake-
walk, as four of the six teams that
qualified for Saturday came from
the conference.
In the end, it was a perfect
weekend for Michigan.
"It's great to be a Michigan
Wolverine," Golder said. "We
had a great championship, you
get a one-two sweep, and the
all-around and win the team
title, (13) All-Americans and one
national champion on two events.
It doesn't get a whole lot better
than that. I'm very, very pleased
and anxious to host next year."

Beating
JUNE 12, 2013 - In a season
that was expected to be fraught
with losses during a process of
rebuilding, the Michigan baseball
team exceeded expectations by
taking its first steps back into col-
lege baseball relevancy.
From the time his players
arrived on campus in the fall to
the end of the season, first-year
Michigan coach Erik Bakich
instilled a winning culture in a
program that had many more
losses
than wins
in recent MAX
memory. COHEN
Once the On Baseball
season
began, the
newfound expectation of win-
ning became evident while the
Wolverines (14-10 Big Ten, 29-27
overall) consistently battled back
from adversity on their way to
earning the program's first berth
to the six-team Big Ten Tourna-
ment since 2010.
"This team was on a mission to
really bring the winning culture
back to Michigan," Bakich said.
"You prepare and you play with
the expectation that you're going
to be competing for champion-
ships."
The leadership council,
worked throughout the season to
help their coach instill the win-
ning culture among their younger
teammates.
You could see it had paid off
on the final regular-season game,
when the Wolverines not only
earned a Big Ten Tournament
bid, but also trounced Nebraska
in the process. Though Michigan
was eliminated from the double-
elimination tournament after two
games, its appearance demon-
strated the beginning of success
in the program.
"As a coach, your goal is to get
the maximum potential out of
your team," Bakich said. "I felt
like with this particular group,
we squeezed every drop, every
ounce of energy out ofit."
There were times during the
season when using every ounce
of energy wasn't enough for the

all expectations

Wolverines. Michigan took its
lumps, particularly during a
12-game stretch in which the
Wolverines went 5-7 when Bion-
di was out because of a sprained
thumb.
All season long, Biondi encap-
sulated the spirit of the team in
ways not visible in the box scores.
When he returned from his
thumb injury, he couldn't swing
a bat. Yet he was in the Michigan
lineup during the team's sweep
of Michigan State, attempting to
bunt for a base hit each time at
the plate while playing his usual
rangy defense.
"It just captured everybody's
enthusiasm and just really was a
huge sparkplug and a catalyst for
us," Bakich said.
Biondi continued to demon-
strate the new winning mental-
ity of the program by playing
through an injury later in the sea-
son. He even switched to second
base during the final series of the
regular season - the last of his
Michigan career - so that Bakich
could put the best lineup on the
field.
As the Wolverine baseball pro-
gram looks forward, it will have
to do so without Biondi and the
other leaders who helped precipi-
tate the team's change in men-
tality. With Bakich at the helm,
Michigan will look to new lead-

PAUL SH ERMAN/Daily
ers to carry the program into the
next phase of its development as
Biondi and O'Neill pursue profes-
sional baseball careers.
Bakich sees freshman short-
stop Travis Maezes, freshman
second baseman Jacob Cronen-
worth and freshman left-hand-
er Evan Hill as future leaders
because they already established
themselves as workhorses on and
off the field this season. Bakich
looks forward to the arrival of
next year's highly-touted recruit-
ing class, his first at Michigan as
he looks to guide the team to the
next level.
The incoming class drummed
up more excitement when four
of the players were selected on
the third day of the MLB Draft.
Bakich expects them all not only
to come to Michigan, but to help
the program do much more than
earn a bid to the Big Ten Tourna-
ment.
"While everybody was happy
to get to the Big Ten Tourna-
ment, everybody also realizes
that this past year was the worst
year Michigan baseball is going
to have moving forward," Bakich
said.
And he could be right. Espe-
cially since he doesn't have to
spend time implementing a win-
ning attitude.

Women's DMR runs away with National Championship

By ELI SPARKMAN
For the Daily
MARCH 11, 2013 - The Michi-
gan women's track and field team
captured the program's fourth-
ever Indoor NCAA Champion-
ship in the distance medley relay
event Friday at the Randal Tyson
track in Fayetteville, Ark.
Led by its three seniors, the
relay team has a potent mix of
experience, talent and confi-
dence, and it's proven to be one
of the most successful teams in
Michigan history. The relay won
the Big Ten Championship in
Geneva, Ohio, two weeks ago and

set a program record by running
the fastest time in the nation last
week in South Bend, Ind., with a
time of 9:56.66. The four athletes
once again outdid themselves this
week by re-breaking their fast-
est time in program history with
a race time of 9:56.46 to win the
Indoor NCAA Championship.
The Wolverines' national
championship relay team con-
sisted of senior Rebecca Addison
running the 1200-meter portion,
freshman Maya Long running the
400-meter, senior Jillian Smith
racing the 800-meter leg and
senior Amanda Eccleston clos-
ing out the relay with the crucial

1600-meter leg.
"It was really exciting after
qualifying last weekend with
the best time in the nation," said
assistant coach Mike McGuire.
"The girls came in with a real
focus, it was really exciting hav-
ing three seniors out there and I
think it was a really great way to
end their careers."
As the distance coach, McGuire
has a lot to do with the success of
the relay team. He's been work-
ing with distance and relay run-
ners at Michigan with head coach
James Henry for the last 21 years.
McGuire is also the head coach of
the Michigan cross country team

of which Rebecca Addison and
Jillian Smith are captains, so the
experience and chemistry needed
for success are there.
All of the recent success, com-
bined with the experience of the
three seniors and the coaching
staff, proved to be key in winning
the championship in the face of
the nerves.
"You go in feeling ready to a
degree because we won the Big
Ten in the event with a nation-
best performance," McGuire said.
"But it's also a National Champi-
onship so there's some nervous
energy you have to deal with."
Despite the nerves, the Wol-

verines distance medley relay
team won in decisive fashion,
edging runner-up Villanova by a
second and a half.
"Rebecca Addison's leadoff
was a little touch and go early on
because she was in the back of the
pack," McGuire said. "But she did
a really good job of rallying, par-
ticularly in the last lap to hand off
as a close third. Maya's 400-meter
leg kept us in about the same spot,
Jill Smith moved us up into the
lead on her third leg which was
800 meters. Amanda just did an
outstanding job anchoring, run-
ning as fast as she did, leading the
whole way was as good of a per-

formance as we've ever had."
Also competing for Michigan
was junior Erin Busbee who fin-
ished sixth overall in the long
jump witha mark of 6.33 meters.
The mark earned her first-team
All-American honors at her inau-
gural NCAA Championship.
In the mile, sophomore Shan-
non Osika finished 14th and was
awarded second-team All-Ameri-
can honors with a time of 4:43.43.
The Wolverines finished in
15th place in the National Indoor
rankings tied with both UCLA
and Florida State with a total of 13
points. No. 1 Oregon dominated
the field with a total of 56 points.

Special season comes to close, 'M' falls in Sweet 16

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
MAY 23, 2013 - If you were
to ask any of the No. 10 Michigan
women's tennis players what they
would be doing Saturday morning
at 1:30 am, the answer would be
unanimous: sleeping.
Instead, the Wolverines were
playing the No. 7 UCLA women's
tennis team in their Sweet 16
matchup - a match that started
around four hours late. And the
delay ultimately proved too much,
as Michigan fell 4-0 on Friday
night and Saturday morning.
The Wolverines started the
highly anticipated match at 11:00
pm central time in Urbana, Ill. and
did not finish until the wee hours
of the morning. After giving up a
tightly contested doubles point,
UCLA (19-5) cruised behind its
strong singles play.
"It was a very difficult day,"
said Michigan coach Ronni Ber-
nstein. "You have to figure out
when to eat and hit, and we start-
ed over four hours late. I didn't
want them sitting around the
hotel all day, and we tried to get
them moving, while making sure

they had enough food in them. It
was just unusual circumstances.
It was tough for us, but for UCLA
as well."
For Michigan (10-1 Big Ten,
23-6 overall), winning the doubles
point has been the key to success.
Entering Friday's dual, the Wol-
verines were undefeated when
winning the point, and just 3-5
without it. The point becomes
even more crucial when an oppos-
ing team boasts a strong singles
lineup - something that has car-
ried UCLA all season. The Bruins
have five nationally ranked singles
players - two in the Top 20.
Michigan got down early at the
third spot, putting more pressure
on the first and second pairs. After
eventually losing at No. 3, the
Wolverines looked to their top-
pair of sophomore Emina Bektas
and junior Brooke Bolender. The
nation's sixth-ranked duo has
been a force to be reckoned with.
Bektas and Bolender, perhaps
the most aggressive team in the
nation, served and volleyed their
way to a 8-6 victory, evening up
the doubles score to put the dou-
bles point in the second match's
hands.

Sophomore Sarah Lee and
senior Mimi Nguyen have found
success as an unconventional pair,
with Lee hitting a big ball, while
Nguyen is more of a crafty player.
The duo jumped out to a 5-2 lead,
but went on to give up two breaks.
All tied up at 6-6, with Lee serv-
ing, the pair couldn't close out the
game after going to three deuce
points. Down 7-6, the Michigan
pair broke back, but couldn't hold
serve once again. UCLA served
out the match, giving the Bruins
the highly coveted doubles point.
"We had a good start at num-
ber two, and I thought the UCLA
was struggling big time," Ber-
nstein said. "When you have a
UCLA team down, you have to
close them out. Getting that dou-
bles point would have been huge
momentum wise and we let it get
away from us. We had chances,
but couldn't do it."
The Wolverines entered singles
play well aware of the singles line-
up the Bruins boasted. But no one
knew better than Bektas, set to
playNo. 3 RobinAnderson. Bektas
knew in order to be successful she
would have to exploit Anderson by
strong first serves, and put away

volleys, but against Anderson, it's
much easier said than done.
Anderson's shots were falling,
often times passing Bektas at the
net, ultimately winning, 6-3,6-4.
"I don't think she made enough
first serves, and that's huge for
her game, especially against a
kid like Robin, who makes good
returns and is quick," Bernstein
said. "Emina needed to have a
better first serve percentage, and
she couldn't doit. She almost had
an easier time breaking, which is
unusual."
The Wolverines also lost at the
sixth and second spots to give
UCLA the match victory.
Despite the loss, Bernstein
made it clear that she is proud
of this team and that the future
remains bright.
"It's obviously disappointing
losing in the Sweet 16, but we had
another great season," Bernstein
said. "There is alot ofsuccess to be
seen. We have agreat base return-
ing, with three new kids coming
next year. We just have to stay
healthy and improve our doubles.
Overall it was agreat year, and we
have to look into the positives of
that."

Junior Brooke Bolender will have their song "Hundred Level' played Saturday.

BUSINESS
New restaurants to
open in Union

Several businesses
to lease vacant
locations
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
NOV. 13, 2012 - The days of
Frosty desserts and Mrs. Fields
cookie cakes in the Michigan
Union may be numbered.
The leases for several busi-
nesses in the Union - includ-
ing Amer's Mediterranean Deli,
Subway, Pizza Hut, Wendy's and
the multi-restaurant space that
includes Mrs. Fields, Freshens
smoothies and Auntie Anne's
pretzels - will expire in April,
creating space for three new
businesses in the food court to
debut next fall.
The only current vendor that
will remain in the Union is Panda
Express, which signed a lease
that expires in 2018.
University Unions is currently
accepting requests for proposals
from local and chain restaurants.
The space currently occupied
by Amer's on the first floor of
the Union will be transformed
into a Marketcaf6 operated by
University Unions that will fea-
ture MHealthy food and drink
options, a deli, coffee and spe-
cialty drinks along with other
on-the-go options.
Susan Pile, the director of the
Michigan Union and the Center
for Campus Involvement, said
about 40 interested businesses
attended a pre-proposal meet-
ing held last week to learn more
about the opportunity.
After the Dec. 13 proposal
deadline, a committee comprised
of students and Union employ-
ees will assess the proposals and
contact approved businesses in
late January to discuss contract
negotiations.
Pile said she and the student
advisory board have identified
four dining concepts - chicken
and burgers, a deli/sandwich
shop, an international vendor and
8 "pizza plus," which includes
pizza, pasta and breadsticks -
that are of particular interest to
students and will take priority in
the decision process.
"Our goal is really to provide
a nice complementary set of
options down in the (basement of
the Union)," Pile said. "We don't
want to have a vendor that's com-
peting directly with another ven-
dor. I think that would actually
limit options for students."
Pile also said the seating adja-
cent to the food vendors in the
area near Wendy's and Subway
will be renovated. According to
her, improvements will be made
to seating, lighting, architectural
elements and flooring.
"If you go down there now
it's pretty dark ... it feels a little
dated, alittle enclosed,"Pile said.
"We can actually get ... a vaulted
ceiling and some lighting that'll
be much improved. Maybe some
different types of seating ... some
counter-top or high-top seating,
or a nice long community table."
Laura Seagram, a market-
ing communications specialist
for University Unions, said the
expected cost of the renovations
is still unknown because design
and engineering plans are not
finalized. She addedthatthe Uni-

versity's Board of Regents is not
required to approve the choice of

vendors in the Union, but will be
kept informed through E. Roys-
ter Harper, the University's vice
president for student affairs.
The Union has made healthy
eating a priority in the search.
Seagram said nutrition stan-
dards will play a prominent role
in the decision making process.
"Another thing we are ask-
ing all of the applicants to bring
forth is their healthy options,
even an expansion of what they
may have now, because that's
really important on campus,"
Seagram said. "The whole point
is to have a balance of options."
Keith Soster, the food ser-
vice director for the University
Unions, said student feedback
has indicated that the Unions
should provide more seasonal
selections, which he hopes will
come to fruition in the Market-
cafe.
"It's more than a coffee shop
or a cafe per se, and we want it to
have that market atmosphere,"
Soster said. "... Envision a deli
case with a fresh array of salads
fixings and then you can have
your salad prepared right there
for you. Or you can have a grab-
and-go type option."
LSA senior Archana Bharad-
waj, the chair of the Michigan
Union Board of Representatives,
said incorporating more locally
grown and nutritional produce
into Union food options was a
priority for the student board.
"I think these changes will
be really reflective of what we,
as students, want to see in the
Union," Bharadwaj said.
LSA senior Caroline Canning,
thevice chair ofthe Board ofRep-
resentatives and the president of
LSA Student Government, said
she and other committee mem-
bers want to make the Union
more unique to the University,
and they are excited about the
upcoming changes.
"The finishes that we're look-
ing at are things that are more
modernized but also a more
timeless sort of feeling," Can-
ning said. "If we wanted to ren-
ovate more of that downstairs
area, we could continue using
the tiles and using the same wall
fixtures ... to make it look cohe-
sive."
It is unknown whether the
food vendors in the Michigan
League or the Pierpont Com-
mons will also change. Seagram
said the changes are a model for
the Division of Student Affairs
to potentially follow in the resi-
dence halls.
"We're all trying to meet the
needs of students as best as we
can as the chances present them-
selves," Seagram said.
Kinesiology junior Alexandra
Putich said she never buys food
from Union vendors because
they aren't particularly accom-
modating to her nutrition needs.
"I'm gluten free ... so I know
they don't serve those options
here," Putich said. "If they
accommodated those kinds of
things I'd be more likely to eat
here."
LSA senior Ryan Marina said
he eats at the Union about once
every two months, but he would
be interested and more likely
to eat there if ethnic food were
available.
"I mainly get the feel that it's
fast food down here," Marina
said. "Maybe something else

would spice it up."

Borders space to be filled

New tenants to
move in by mid-
2013 on E. Liberty
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily News Editor
JAN. 23, 2013 - Upon com-
pletion of a major remodel, the
former, original Borders store
on East Liberty Street will once
again have tenants.
Brendan Cavender, a real-
estate broker at Colliers Inter-
national, said the space is being
renovated to fit retail shops and
restaurants on the ground floor
and offices on the second floor.
The construction, which
started in late November, is
expected to be completed
this summer and will include
between five and seven new
storefronts on the East Liberty
side of the building, Cavender
said.
"Right now what's happening
is the landlord is demo-ing out
the whole building," Cavender
said. "They have plans to do
major upgrades on the outside

and completely update and redo
the interior."
The space is being devel-
oped by Hughes Properties,
which took control of the build-
ing in June 2012. Ron Hughes,
the company's executive, said
they have had many businesses
express interest in the property,
and he hopes to have tenants
move in by the middle of 2013.
"We've had tremendous
response for leasing the build-
ing," Hughes said. "We have in
various stages, about 80 percent
of the building pre-leased."
Cavender said Colliers is in
"final negotiations" with mul-
tiple businesses, but couldn't
disclose the names of the poten-
tial tenants. He added that they
hope to have a mix of local and
national businesses in the space.
Rich Bellas, board president
of the State Street Area Associa-
tion, said he hopes the new busi-
nesses will help the other local
shops more than Borders helped
in its final years.
"Borders was great in its hey-
day, but of course over the last
few years - even before their

demise - they had steadily gone
downhill," Bellas said. "We're
just glad to have that space
filled."
Sean Havera, senior project
manager at Hughes Properties,
said the initial construction is
going well so far, and they hope
to start phase two of the demoli-
tion in the comingweeks.
"Everything is going smooth-
ly," he said.
Havera, who last worked on
the Landmark apartment build-
ing with Hughes Properties,
said they are keeping the origi-
nal fagade but added windows,
multiple entryways and updated
fixtures in order to change the
look of the building.
Susan Pollay, executive direc-
tor of the Ann Arbor Downtown
Development Authority, wrote
in an e-mail interview that she
thinks the breaking up of the
building into smaller business
spaces is a wise decision in the
present economic climate.
"The continuing evolution of
downtown appears to indicate
that the marketplace right now
can support smaller store-front

sizes than we had previously,"
Pollay wrote.
Bellas said the construction
workers downtown have been
supporting current businesses
already, and he hopes the trend
will continue once the new ten-
ants move in.
"Having workers here every
day is very important to the
neighborhood," Bellas said.
"Having people shop and eat
where they live and where they
work - to have that number of
people here on a daily basis, just
benefits everybody."
Pollay is glad such an impor-
tant downtown building will be
filled again.
"It is a terrific thing to see
the former Borders building
filled with tenants, as it has
*been an anchor location for the
neighborhood for more than 40
years," Pollay wrote. "Down-
town is at its heart a commer-
cial district, and it's great to see
new businesses moving into the
building."

Best Breakfast
ANGELO'S
Most arguments about Ann Arbor's best breakfast joint end in one word: Angelo's. Tucked
away near the University's medical campus,you'd think the restaurant would be too off the beat-
en path to survive - until you get a glimpse of the line in the morning, often stretching down the
sidewalk. Only consistently delicious food can draw such a devoted following, and this proves to
be the case at Angelo's.
If the menu looks too sophisticated for the breakfast commoner - with entries like crab cake
Benedict, eggs Florentine and pumpkin pancakes - just take a shot in the dark. It's hard to go
wrong. The hollandaise sauce is creamy, the pancakes are fluffy and the egg concoctions tend to
deliver on the flavors promised. Just make sureto getthere early to avoid the wait and soak in a
slice of Ann Arbor culture.

CUPCAKE STATION
Blissful. That's the only way to describe these cupcakes: blissful and all of its associated syn-
onyms including, but not limited to, heavenly, idyllic and beatific.
The biggest problem, nay the only problem, with Cupcake Station is there's just too much tasti-
ness. How is one expected to choose between the marshmallow-filled "Cookies and Cream," the
nationally recognized "Bump-A-Licious" and the classic chocolate-frosted "Original," not'to
mention the 21 other flavorsbaked fresh every day?
As far as location, Cupcake Station is a tad out of the way, located on the corner of E. Liberty and
Main. You have to really want that cupcake, but trust me you want that cupcake.
These cupcake artists - and they are artists - perfected the all-important frosting-to-cake
ratio. There's so much flavor, so much sweetness, so much sheer goodness baked into every cake.
War would cease to exist if there was a Cupcake Station in every country. These guys even sponsor
charities with free cupcakes; are they saints or are they temptation itself?I don't know, and I don't
care - just take my money already.

Best Coffee

ESPRESSO ROYALE
After a long day of lectures and homework, there's nothing more soothing than the knowl-
edge that your choice of comfy armchairs, hot coffee and calm folk music await at your local
coffee shop.
It's by creating that home-away-from-home atmosphere that Espresso Royale has earned
the love of the Ann Arbor community. Even though the chain got its start in California, and
despite the fact that you know perfectly well that there are two more locations within walk-
ing distance, every time you go in it feels like a quaint, one-of-a-kind local business. The
baked goods are always fresh and delicious, the coffee aromatic and inviting and the baristas
friendly and helpful. If you're looking for something more adventurous, there's a full menu of
lattes, teas and iced drinks to appeal to the coffee shop connoisseur.
Espresso is exactly what a college coffee shop is supposed to be. Whether hanging out with
friends, looking for somethingto keep you awake through your next lecture or simply trying
to find somewhere to sit down and relax, there's no better place to kick back and enjoy a hot
cup of espresso.

BEN & JERRY'S
Everyone loves ice cream. Therefore, everyone loves Ben and Jerry's.
It's that simple.
Located on South State Street, right next to its nemesis, Stucchi's, it's not hard to see why
the people of Ann Arbor have chosen B&J's as their favorite.
The ice cream, waffle cones and smoothies blend to create an irresistible aroma that capti-
vates your senses as you glide to the counter, where a wide selection of frozen dessert flavors
await. The chocolaty sweet kick to the nose as helpful employees scoop out phish food from
behind the counter is enough to remind you that you've come to the right place, and you won't
be disappointed.
But the best part of eating ice cream at Ben and Jerry's is the nostalgia. It's just like when
you were a kid - after begging your parents for some ice cream and promising you'll brush
your teeth, you enter a place where the walls are as colorful as the flavors, everyone's happy
and the ice cream is just so damn good. Sure, when you walk in now, your parents aren't with
you and you're never going to brush your teeth, but what remains are the good times you
spent with the people you like and the ice cream you love.

Best Burger
BLIMPY BURGER
There's a reason Blimpy has been featured on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" and "Man vs.
Food," as well as named by USA Today and the Travel Channel as one of the top spots in the
country to get a burger.
But greasy patties, fresh ingredients and delicious, deep-fried side dishes are just part of
what makes Blimpy Burger a must-eat for every Ann Arborite. Blimpy feels like a burger joint
should. From the old-school dining setup to the signs warning about the dangers of eating
here, Blimpy does it right. As soon as you walk in, you get the inexplicable sensation that you
are about to have an incredible experience (you are).
When the University purchased Blimpy's property in late 2012, it spelled the end for Blimpy
Burger as it has been since 1953. The restaurant will move to a new location this summer, tak-
ing with it the best burger in town, if not the world. So here's to Blimpy Burger and all the
great memories it's helped us make, and all the ones it will help us make in the future.

Best Sushi
SADAKO
When IoncetoldmycousinfromCaliforniathatIwasn't fondofrawfish,shelaughedandsaid,
"That's so middle-of-the-countryofyou."As aborn-and-raised Midwesterner, Iwasinsulted.And
as a Wolverine, I was irked that she would so rudely assume all of Midwest was a cultural waste-
land. The best part of Ann Arbor is its diverse restaurant and entertainment scene, which is why
my favorite place to relax after a long week is over a plate of shrimp tempura at Sadako.
Sadako is not avisualescape,nor does ithave any pseudo-Japanese gimmicks -ituses its fresh,
simple food to attract customers. You are guaranteed to get exceptional sushi at alow price, sur-
rounded by a diverse mix of sorority girls, tweed-covered professors and international students
there for a taste of home. Sadako has options for sushi wimps like myself, with creamy Califor-
nia rolls and crisp Shrimp tempura, while also boasting beautiful seafood creations for those
more adventurous. My friends swear by the Cobra rolls, which consist of eel and shrimp nestled
between avocado and cucumber. Sadako is humble in all its glory, which makes those $5 rolls all
the more satisfying.
