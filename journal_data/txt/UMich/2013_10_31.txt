Students file
complaints with

By$TEPHANIE SidENOUDA
aily StafReporter
An investigation has been
launched into the University's
chapter of the Theta Xi fra-
ternity after several students
filed formal complaints with
the University administration
regarding the fraternity's now-
cancelled plans to host a party
with a "ratchet" theme next
Thursday.
Many students of color say
they were personally offended
by the invitation that was sent
via Facebook, complaining
that it parodied Black culture
and offended women, refer-
ring to twerking contests,
"bad bitches," gang references
and repeated use of the word
"ratchet."
Early Thursday morning,
Theta Xi members said the
fraternity won't be comment-

ing on the matter. Fraternity
brothers were camped out
on the Diag for their annual
"Defend the Diag" ritual.
Dean of Students Laura
Blake Jones, who lodged a
formal complaint with the
fraternity, said the University
responded immediately and
took student complaints very
seriously.
Jones held a meeting yes-
terday with the Greek Life
Director Mary Beth Seiler,
Interfraternity Council lead-
ers and LSA senior Eric Quang,
Theta Xi's president. The
University also reached out
to Theta Xi's national board,
whose members expressed
concern and are conducting
their own investigation.
The administration made it
clear that the party will not be
allowed to take place on Nov. 7,
and Theta Xi's national head-
quarters has determined all
further social events will be
suspended until their investi-
gations are concluded.

led a discussion Wednesday
about domestic violence and
the importance of educating the
community on the epidemic.

The event was sponsored by
the South Asian Awareness Net-

talk focused on different types
of abuse - verbal, emotional,
economic, sexual and physical
- and how individuals can cope
with abuse.
"The most at-risk age group
for women is ages 16 through 24,
and that's a lot of undergradu-

Interns are given

By PAULA FRIEDRICH
Daily StaffReporter
Central Student Govern-
ment's internship program is
gearingup for another year.
The goal of the program is*
to give motivated freshmen a
chance to hone their leader-
ship skills, get involved quickly
and have a "big picture" view
of CSG. The program was cut
in 2007, but Manish Parikh,
then CSG president, revived it
in 2012.
CSG President Michael
Proppe sail the intern experi-
ence is something that is usu-
ally only accessible through
the Exegutive Commission or
the General Assembly, both of
which aren't open to freshmen.
Proppe said the program

was scaled down considerably
from last year to create a more
valuable experience forinterns.
The program has shifted from
24 internsto eightinterns, each
with an executive officer to
help ease their workload.
Proppe said the program
also benefits interns by giving
them responsibility early in
their CSG careers, along with
taking sdme of the research
load off of himself.
LSA sophomore Bryan Fred-
erick said without the intern-
ship program he would never
have gotten involvedwith CSG.
"I wouldn't know what the
heck CSG is," Frederick said.
"I think that's the reality of
a lot of freshmen. They don't
know what CSG stands for or
they just don't know how to get
involved."
Frederick was part of last
year's intern outreach team,
which has since turned into a
commission that he chairs.
He said the intern program
gave him "the guts" to do

S W I NG: I' FUiN -

The traveling bestseller

Jennifer Coburn is a bestsell-
ing fiction author and journal-
ist whose novels include "Tales
from the Crib" and "Reinventing
Mona." She graduated from the
University in 1988 with a bach-
elor's degree in communications.
Her new book, "We'll Always
Have Paris," will be available in
stores in April.
What piqued your interest in
writing novels?
I had always been interested
in short story and fiction writing,
but journalism kind of just hap-
pened. Someone once approached
me to write an article, and that's
how it started. I've written a lot
of op-ed pieces for around 40

regional newspapers, like The
Miami Herald and also national
publications like Mothering,
Salon and Huffington Post.
Why did you decide to write a
memoir?
I've written six novels, and
I wanted to try a new genre.
Actually, my mom suggested I
write about my travels with my
daughter. It was a four-part trip
to Europe. We first went when
my daughter was eight and then
11, 14, and the last one was when
she was 16. I used to always tell
people about my travels and
they were like 'You should write
these down' - and, eventually,
I did.

I absolutely loved my years at

of other alumni will tell you this,
that I had taken more advantage
of the resources. Our alumni
network is amazing; they have
been extraordinarily helpful. I
can pick up the phone, call any

City Council may repeal.
crosswalk ordinance

Members say
ordinance conflicts
with state law
By FARONE E. RASHEED
Daily StaffReporter
A controversial city crosswalk
ordinance continues to be a topic
of scrutiny by the Ann Arbor City
Council members, and residents,
and it mayface repeal.
The dispute centers on an
excerpt of the Ann Arbor city
ordinance, Title X, Article XII,
10.148. - which states that at
intersections without traffic sig-
nals, drivers must stop for jny
pedestrian stopped at the curb,
curb line or ramp leading to a
crosswalk.
This is in contrast to the
Michigan Uniform Traffic Code,
which more broadly states that
drivers should yield the right-
of-way when a pedestrian is in
a crosswalk on the half of the
roadway on which the vehicle is
traveling, or when the pedestrian
is approaching closely from the
opposite site of the freeway. The
state code prohibits pedestrians
from walking in front of a vehicle
when the driver lacks sufficient
load to yield
Councilmember Sally Petersen
(D-Ward 2) said she, along with
Councilmembers Sumi Kailasap-
athy (D-Ward 1) and Jane Lumm
(I-Ward 2) plan to co-sponsor
a motion that would repeal the
city's requirement that drivers
stop for pedestrians when they
are standing at the curb. She said
the resolution would better align
Ann Arbor code with the MUTC,
which the rest ofthe state follows.

City council approved the revi-
sion to the ordinance in Decem-
ber 2011 that no longer required
vehicles to stop for pedestrians
approaching or within cross-
walks, instead requiring vehicles
to stop for a pedestrian standing
at the curb or within the cross-
walk. At the time, the revision
was made to clear up ambiguity in
the wording of the ordinance.
ButPetersen explainedthatthe
ordinance instills a false sense of
securityin pedestrians,whooften
believe they have an absolute
right-of-way and that motorists
will stop when the pedestrians
reach the curb.
"What we've seen is that isn't
necessarily the case - that motor-
ists don't stop because this local
law - A, it's not enforced in Ann
Arbor, and, B, it's not the same as
in other communities," Petersen
said. "I think it's confusing to
drivers because it's inconsistent."
Councilwoman Sabra Briere
(D-Ward 1), on the other hand,
did not see a repeal of the ordi-
nance as a good solution to exist-
ing problems.
"Part of the problem with see-
ing the ordinance as the issue is
that it places the fault for a traf-
fic accident on an ordinance that
I would bet most people haven't
read, much less haven't heard
about," Briere said. "A pedes-
trian in a crosswalk always has
the right to be in the crosswalk
and repealing this ordinance -
whether that's a good idea or a
bad idea - doesn't address the
problems along Plymouth Road."
Briere expressed a desire to
see increased enforcement of the
ordinance, with an overall objec-
tine of promoting crosswalk safe-
ty.

The Washtenaw Biking and
Walking Coalition has also
opposed calls to repeal the ordi-
nance, and started an online peti-
tion to help preserve the current
statute.
WBWC Erica Briggs explained
that the difference between the
state and city laws was based on
interpretation. While states like
California have established that
the crosswalk begins while the
pedestrian waits at the curb, the
MUTC stipulates that the cross-
walk does not begin until one
steps into the street.
"There are a number of stud-
ies that have shown that we
basically need coordinated
education, enforcement and
good appropriate engineering,"
Briggs said. "We haven't very
successfully done that in our
community."
Consequently, she iterated
concerns about residents, par-
ticularly those with disabili-
ties, crossing large streets, such
as Jackson Road, in a safe and
efficient manner without the
requirements set by the local
ordinance.
"It became very apparent that
when traffic didn't stop, people
were pretty much putting their
life in their own hands and it was
really risky," Briggs said.
With the process still ongoing,
the coalition continues to work
with city officials in developing
an effective and efficient cross-
walk policy.
"What we all agreed on is that
we all want pedestrians to be safe,
and we all want to pedestrians to
have access to a road to be able
to cross it safely," Petersen said.
"Where we differ is how that
should happen."

State House votes
to add extra safety

The measure was introduced
after MLive.com reported

BUFFALO, New York
Bus driver stops
woman from
jumping off bridge
A bus driver is being hailed as
a hero for preventing a woman
from jumping off a Buffalo high-
way overpass.
About 20 McKinley High
School students had just stepped
aboard Darnell Barton's Metro
bus Oct. 18 when he spotted a
woman who had climbed over a
guardrail and stood leaning over
the afternoon traffic zipping
along the Scajaquada Express-
way below.
With cars and an occasional
pedestrian continuing to pass by
her, Barton wasn't sure at first
that the woman was in distress.
He stopped his bus, opened
the door and asked if she needed
help, at that moment conflicted
between the rules of his job,
which required him to call his
dispatcher, and his training as a
former volunteer firefighter and
member of the Buffalo Special
Police, which told him that if he
made contact, he shouldn't break
it.

MEXICO CITY
Mexico evacuates
4,500 residents
due to gas line leak
A geyser of gasoline spewing
from a state-owned pipeline in
western Mexico forced officials
to evacuate about 4,500 people
on Wednesday. Officials blamed
the accident on fuel thieves.
Photos from the scene in the
town of Tlajomulco, near the
city of Guadalajara, showed
a plume of gasoline shooting
into the air from the pipeline,
located in a field near a hous-
ing development. Guadalajara
is Mexico's second-largest city
and the capital of Jalisco state.
The gasoline had not caught
fire and there were no immedi-
ate reports of injuries. The clos-
est homes were about 150 yards
(meters) from the leak.

Syrian leaders
comments casts
more doubt on
peace efforts
DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -
Syrian President Bashar Assad
told the Arab League-U.N.
envoy Wednesday that foreign
support for the armed opposi-
tion must end if any political
solution to the country's con-
flict is to succeed, state-run
media said.
Assad's comments to Lakhdar
Brahimi during their meeting
in Damascus cast further doubt
on already sputtering efforts to
convene an international peace
conference to try to end the
country's civil war.
The United States, Russia
and the United Nations have
been trying for months to bring
the Syrian government and the
opposition together in Geneva
to attempt to negotiate a politi-
cal resolution to the conflict.
After repeated delays, efforts
renewed in earnest last month
to organize the conference, but
the Syrian opposition remains
deeply divided over whether to
attend, while the government
refuses to sit down with the
armed opposition.
Brahimi's trip to Damascus
was the latest stop on a region-
al tour in recent days as he tries
to lay the groundwork for the
proposed peace talks in Geneva
that are tentatively planned for
next month. But Assad, whose
government has regained the
momentum in recent months in
the conflict, showed little sign
of inching toward compromise.
"For any political solution to
be successful, it is crucial to halt
support for terrorist groups and'
the countries that sponsor them,
facilitate the entry of terror-
ist mercenaries and offer them
money, weapons and logistical
support," Assad was quoted by
Al-Ikhbariya television as tell-
ing Brahimi. "The Syrian people
alone are entitled to draw the
future of Syria. Any solution

must be approved by them and
reflect their wishes away from
any foreign intervention."
"This is paramount to prepare
the circumstances for dialogue
and put clear mechanisms that
achieve this goal," Assad said.
Turkey, Saudi Arabia and
Qatar are among the Syr-
ian opposition's most active sup-
porters, providing financial and
logistical support to the rebels.
The United States and some ofits
European allies have provided
non-lethal aid, although Wash-
ington has promised for months
to send light arms to Western-
backed opposition fighters.
The meeting Wednesday
between Brahimi and Assad was
the first direct contact between
the men in 10 months. After his
last trip to Syria in December
2012, Brahimi angered Syrian
authorities when he said that
40 years of rule by Assad's fam-
ily was "too long." Syrian offi-
cials then accused him of being
biased.
The diplomatic push aims
to end a conflict that has killed
more than 100,000 people and
forced some 2 million more to
flee the country. Now in its third
year, the civil war pits a primari-
ly Sunni Muslimrebelmovement
against a government whose
security forces are stacked with
members ofAssad'sAlawite sect,
an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
The Britain-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights
activist group said rebels killed
at least 17 people in an attack on
a predominantly Alawite village
in the central province of Homs
early Wednesday.
Observatory directory Rami
Abdurrahman said the opposi-
tion fighters killed six govern-
ment troops at a checkpoint in
Shallouh before sweeping into
the village itself, where they
killed 11 residents.
The SANA state news agency
blamed the attack on a "terror-
ist group," and said 13 locals
were killed. The report did not
mention any slain soldiers. The
government refers to those try-
ing to topple Assad as "terror-

Newtown families ask task
force to not release 911 tapes

Relatives say
written transcripts
of the calls are
permissible
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -
A husband and a mother of two
victims of the Sandy Hook Ele-
mentary School massacre told a
Connecticut task force Wednes-
day they don't want the 911 tapes
released, saying no one needs to
hear the sounds from that day.
Bill Sherlach, whose wife,
Mary, was killed on Dec.14, said
the panel should recommend a
compromise to state lawmakers,
such as providing members of
the media and others a written
transcription of the emergency
calls.
'There must be some sort of
balance between making sure
that the public's right to know is
sustained while the victims-of-
certain-atrocities' right to pri-
vacy is also honored," Sherlach
told the task force members. He
added that "911 transcripts can
relay all the necessary informa-
tion that the public wants with-
out having to hear the sounds of
a slaughter in the background."
Hours later, the prosecutor
leading the investigation of the
shooting filed an application, ask-
ing a Connecticut court to stay
an order by the state's Freedom
of Information Commission last
month to release the 911 tapes.
The panel had ruled in favor of
The Associated Press, which
sought access to the recordings.

Danbury State's Attorney
Stephen Sedensky II argued
that the stay would ensure his
appeal of the FOI's decision is
not rendered moot; records of
child abuse are not unlawfully
disclosed; victims and witness-
es are not intimated; and state-
ments of victims and witnesses
are not released.
The AP routinely requests
such documents in news gather-
ing. It was done in part to exam-
ine the police response to the
massacre that sent officers from
multiple agencies racing to the
school. The shooting left 20 first
graders and six educators dead.
If the recordings are released,
the AP would review the content
and determine what, if any of it
would meet the news coopera-
tive's standards for publication.
"AP's motivation here is sim-
ple. This was one of the worst
school shootings in U.S. history,
and we're pressing for access
to recordings that could shed
light on the law enforcement
response," said William J. Kole,
New England bureau chief for
the news cooperative.
In June, Connecticut law-
makers passed legislation that
prevented the public release of
crime scene photos and video
evidence depicting a homicide
victim if those records consti-
tute an "unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy" of the victim
or the victim's surviving family
members. The new law also cre-
ated a one-year moratorium on
the release of certain portions
of audiotape and other record-
ings in which the condition of

a homicide victim is described.
The exemption did not, how-
ever, include 911 emergency call
recordings, which are typically
released in Connecticut.
The same legislation cre-
ated The Task Force on Victim
Privacy and the Public's Right
to Know and charged it with
coming up with recommenda-
tions for the General Assembly
to consider in next year's new
legislative session. Earlier this
month, an attorney represent-
ing 22 of the 26 families who
lost relatives in the shooting
asked that the audiotape of the
Sandy Hook 911 calls not be
publicly released.
Both Sherlach and Nicole
Hockley, whose son, Dylan, was
killed, said they are not asking
for a categorical exclusion of all
911 audio tapes from the state's
FOI Act. Rather, they said dif-
ferent elements of each case
need to be considered before
releasing the tapes.
"We're not saying all or noth-
ing," Hockley said.
They maintain that the sensi-
tivity of the Sandy Hook shoot-
ing, the emotional impact the
tapes would have on families
and the fact there's no question
about who committed the crime
support their argument that the
tapes should not be released in
their case. They also remain con-
cerned about the crime scene
photos someday being released,
predicting such images and
sounds would live forever on the
Internet and would be used by
people with various political
agendas.

Male columnist
had criticized gov.
crackdown on
women drivers
DUBAI, United Arab Emir-
ates (AP) - Saudi authorities
have detained a columnist who
supported ending his country's
ban on women driving, activ-
ists said Wednesday.
The activists, who wished
to remain anonymous for fear
of retribution, said Tariq al-
Mubarak was called by inves-
tigators in the capital Riyadh
concerning a stolen car over the
weekend. When he arrived at
the Interior Ministry's Crimi-
nal Investigation Department
on Sunday, he was interrogated
instead about his role in a cam-
paign launched by reformers
seeking the right of women to
drive in the kingdom.
When his friends were
informed they could pick him
up at the investigator's office,
they too were detained for sev-
eral hours and questioned over
the campaign's activities, activ-
ists said.
Human Rights Watch and
activists who know al-Mubarak
say he remains in detention
with no access to a lawyer. The
New York-based organization
called for al-Mubarak's imme-
diate release and on authorities
"to stop harassing and trying to
intimidate activists and women
who defied the driving ban."
The spokesman for the Inte-
rior Ministry, Mansour al-
Turki, could not be reached for

comment.
In a column published in
the pan-Arab daily Asharq al-
Awsat the day of his arrest, al-
Mubarak said extremists are
intimidating people from exer-
cising'their rights. He said the
courts in Saudi Arabia do not
have sufficient provisions to
deter those who threaten and
terrorize others from exercis-
ing their freedoms because
"rights and freedoms ... are not
instilled in our culture, nor our
interpretation of religion."
Al-Mubarak, who also works
as aschoolteacher, was among a
core group of active young Sau-
dis calling for women's right to
drive.
Around 60 women claimed
they got behind the wheel Sat-
urday to oppose the ban. The
campaign sparked protest by
the kingdom's ultraconserva-
tive religious establishment.
The reformers behind the
Oct. 26 driving campaign say
their efforts are ongoing and
that they continue to receive
videos by women filming them-
selves flouting the driving ban.
The activists told The Asso-
ciated Press that they have
been followed for the past sev-
eral days and are anticipating
arrest. They have put in place
contingency plans and emer-
gency numbers for journalists
and rights organizations to call
in case they are detained.
At least two women have
been fined recently by police
for driving, the activists said.
Samia El-Moslimany said she
was given a nearly $135 fine for
driving in the kingdom, though
she has a U.S. driver's license.

Move forward fairly with FAFSA
Lack of transparency leaves some students at a disadvantage
This fall, millions of prospective college students around the nation
will be filling out their Free Application for Federal Student Aid,
to determine if they are eligible for financial aid. The FAFSA
allows students to list 10 schools where they would like their form to be
submitted; many students, however, are unaware that some colleges use
these rankings to inform their admission decision. In some cases, depend-
ing on how students ranked schools, university admission offices use that
list to determine how much aid to grant students, often offering less money
to students who rank their university highest. Universities are conceal-
ing their use of these FAFSA lists in order to best gauge student interest
and save money, but a lack of transparency creates inaccurate surveys and
hurts both schools and students. The fact that the admissions process con-
siders how students prioritize their potential schools in the FAFSA needs
to become common knowledge in order for both sides to benefit.

the place where
everyone else goes. Typically
they're these semi-translucent
shapes of their former selves trying
to convey messages, scare people or
just wait out eternity. I suppose the
nicest thing that can be said about
ghosts is that they aren't real.
Let me state that emphatically:
There are no ghosts. There are no
hauntings. Everything that goes
bump in the night has a name, and
there is nothing under your bed
aside from what you yourself have
placed there. We do not live in a
paranormal world. However, we
also do not live in a normal world.
Far too many of the possible expe-
riences this universe has to offer
are outside of sensible reality for
us to call anything around us nor-
mal or ordinary. Our universe is
extraordinary, and that's my prob-
lem with ghosts.
If pop culture is anything to go
by - and it probably isn't - then the
above description I gave for ghosts
tends to hold true. This is what
people report when they report see-
ing ghosts. When places are said to
be haunted, they are often said to
be haunted by someone who died
there under bad circumstances -
think Civil War battlefields, aban-
doned hospitals or hotels with a
sordid past. Observers of ghosts

will say they see soldiers, patients
and caregivers - all people. And
that's my first gripe with ghosts:
Why stay in the shape of one's for-
mer body? Why not become gigan-
tic or exceedingly small? Why not
experience the world from the per-
spective of an amoeba or a nebula?
And beyond that, why stay in
the shape of your former body, let
alone go to the trouble of wearing
the clothes you died in? Is there
some limitation on how far ghostly
particles can spread apart from one
another or some inhibition from
them assembling in some manner
beside how they were moments
before someone's death? How do
ghosts' underwear know to travel
with them to the other realm but
not to do so if simply thrown away?
And just which of a person's earthly
possessions knows to follow to the
afterlife? Clothes have figured this
out, but cars and computers are
notably absent.
And exactly which moment
before, during or after the death
process does one become a ghost?
The cells of a person continue liv-
ing long after they themselves have
died. So too do the populations of
bacteria we culture all through-
out ourselves - and the 100 tril-
lion or so microorganisms in our
guts surely appreciate it. A heart
can stop beating before a brain
ceases to work; a brain can die long
before the rest of the body. Strokes
and ablations can ruin parts of
the brain years before death, so
does my soul know this and adjust
accordingly? And has the spiri-
tual world figured out how blood
transfusions and organ transplants
affect their ghostly systems? They
figured out their clothing policy,
but have they really kept up with
the medical literature?
And why is it that ghosts only
seem to be found in dark/aban-

doned/scary places? As I said,
ghosts supposedly walk the
grounds of where they met their
untimely deaths, but what is off-
bounds here? Are there ghost
police that say other ghosts can go
a couple hundred feet from the spot
of their demise, but not a couple
hundred more? Can they go up in
the sky, down in the ground? How
far? Is it a spherical region equidis-
tant in all directions? Referenced
to the earth obviously, otherwise
every death would just leave a spec-
tral breadcrumb trail of the path of
the earth as it spins (at about 1,000
mph), as it goes around the sun
(at about 67,000 mph), as the sun
goes through the galaxy (at about
420,000 mph), as our galaxy moves
through the universe (at about 2.2
million mph). If ghosts like dark/
abandoned/scary places, there
are few better than the distances
between galaxies.
Our universe is extraordinary
and ghosts are boring. With this
universe around all around us at its
different scales of space and time,
why would anyone bother scaring
teenagers? Ghosts are free of their
earthly limitations. They could
hear the moan of space-time warp-
ing around giant stars, they could
taste black holes and they could
smell the void. Evwn if requited to
stay on earth they could experience
the molten center of it, a thing of
cosmic beauty just beneathour feet.
They could watchevolutionary pro-
cesses on a global scale. They could
feel our world grow warm.
They could do so much and they
don't. This is why ghosts are lame.
Or maybe I've gotten this all wrong,
maybe thatis what they're all doing.
At least that would explain why we
don't see them.

According to the College Board, more than
two-thirds of full-time undergraduate stu-
dents receive some type of financial aid in the
form of grants, scholarships or work-study.
Filling out the FAFSA provides a gateway to
the nine federal student-aid grants, the 605
state student-aid program and most of the
institutional aid available. It includes more
than 100 questions about a student's assets,
income and dependency that are used along-
side several other factors to determine a stu-
dent's financial aid eligibility. The form notes
that the information included can be sent
to state agencies that will be awarding the
student's aid, but it fails to mention that the
same information will be sent to individual
colleges - let alone used by these schools as a
calculated admission tool.
Universities have found that their rank-
ing on the FAFSA list is a very reliable tool in
determining a student's commitment to that
institutions. W. Kent Barnds, executive vice
president of Augustana College, shared with
CBS News.com that 60 percent of students
who list Augustana first on their FAFSA list
end up enrolling - a much higher percentage
when compared to 30 percent of those who
listed it second and the 10 percent who listed
it third.
The lack of transparency around this tactic
is unfair to those students who rank schools
unaware of how the information can be used,

both in determining a student's admission
and financial aid package. Counselors who
are aware of this secretive, but strategic
.admission tool have advised their students
to list the schools alphabetically to avoid dis-
closing their preferences. Students who are
aware of this policy may rearrange their list
to game the system, leaving other students at
a disadvantage. The institutions also suffer
because when students are not aware of this
process, the information listed is less accu-
rate, and therefore less useful for the schools.
Last Friday, InsideHigherEd contacted
the U.S. Department of Education about this
issue, and they said they will "review the
longstanding practice of sharing the FAFSA
positions with every college." The depart-
ment should undoubtedly work to make
this a more transparent process that cannot
adversely affect those who are unaware of
how their information is being used.
One way that the Department of Education
can work to make sure this process is bene-
ficial to both students and institutions is by
automatically alphabetizing the school rank-
ings. This way, schools will know that they
are part of the student's top-10 list without
rankings. If a student wishes to show more
interest in particular schools, it is that stu-
dent's prerogative to reach out to these spe-
cific institutions and move forward in a way
that is transparent and fair.

City council elections arean oppor-
tunity to voice progressive values
TO THE DAILY:
On Tuesday, Nov. 5, Ann Arbor City Council elections
will be held in all five wards. Students in Ann Arbor, as
a significant portion of the city's population, will have
the opportunity to determine their representation on the
most fundamental level.
It's easy to get caught up in the spectacle and scale of
federal politics and lose sight of the decisions being made
locally. However, local politics affect you more than you
might realize. City council determines the bus routes

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM
for the AATA buses you use. City council mandates
that landlords provide you with the "Rights and Duties
of Tenants" booklet. City council's commitment to the
environment provides you electricity fromnearly 68,000
square feet of solar panels on North Campus. Much more
than on the federal and state level, constituents feel local
policies in a very real way.
Election Day is our opportunity to voice our progres-
sive values. The Democratic candidates have proven to
be allies of students and rely on our support in elections.
Democracy simply doesn't work without participation. If
you've registeredto vote inAnn Arbor make sure you get
out and vote on Nov. 5.

STUDENT UNION OF MICHIGAN I
Why we should say no to Munger dorm

As a member of Greek life, Iclicked on my
Facebook notifications to find yet another fra-
ternity party invitation. Iviewedthe eventepage
to see what exactly Theta Xi was inviting me to
this week, and what I found was confusing, dis-
turbing and hurtful.
"World Star Hip Hop Presents: Hood Ratch-
et Thursday," read the event title. The descrip-
tion went on to inform me that "bad bitches,
white girls, basketball players, thugs, gang-
sters" and "ratchet pussy" (a new term to me)
were all invited.
Scrolling down the event page, I was
appalled by photos of Black men holding fist-
fuls of money and multiple comments made
by people I've met and know stating, "BEST
THEME EVER" and "I'm dressing as Lii'
Wayne/Nicki Minaj".
This invite was sent to me because I'm a
member of Greek life. As a member of Greek
life I can only speak for myself, not my soror-
ity or anyone with similar identities to my own.
It was assumed that my member status negates
me from being offended by such an oppressive
and derogatory theme and the subsequent com-
ments. It angers me that members of a com-
munity - that I often defend to others - could
exploit the identities of students and faculty on
this campus. It's sad to see that list of Greek life
members I defend shrink right before my eyes.
"Why can't you just take the joke?" so many
have already asked. I can't take the joke because
of the alarming number of fraternity brothers
that have asked me if I'm from Detroit when
I attend their events as one of the few women

of color. I can't take the joke because of the.
obscene number of times I've been asked to
"twerk" and "dance" for these white men,
because my Black identity obviously tellsthem I
possess the inherent talent and desire to do so. I
can't take the joke because I don't have the lux-
ury to remove the labels of "hood," "ratchet" or
"bad bitch" after the partyends. The privileged
students on this campus tie those labels to my
identity because of my racial minority status. I
can't take the joke because racism and oppres-
sion are alive and well on this campus; a cam-
pus where I'm often the only person of color in a
classroom. And when I speak in that classroom,
what I have to say is taken as the narrative of
every other Black woman these privileged stu-
dents come in contact with.
So no, I cannot simply take the joke that
Theta Xi thought was an appropriate way to
invite the people they share this campus with,
to have a nice time at their event. Theta Xi invit-
ed the wrong "bad bitch" to their party.
Their first mistake was allowing this
incredibly offensive party theme to make
its way to a Facebook invite that infiltrated
our campus. Theta Xi's second mistake was
commenting and posting on the event page
- making a mockery out of a culture they do
not belong to. Their third mistake was invit-
ing me; assuming that as a member of Greek
life I would be a bystander, doing nothing to
stop "Hood Ratchet Thursday" from going on
without a hitch.

A few months ago, we were
treated to another media blitz over
the "largest donation in the Univer-
sity of Michigan's history," $110 mil-
lion from the Charles Munger, vice
chairman of Berkshire Hathaway,
earmarked for a graduate dormi-
tory. Donations like Munger's are
presented as unqualified wins for
the University. By cultivating rela-
tionships with successful alumni,
the University grows its endowment
and receives money for infrastruc-
ture projects that, in theory, provide
needed educational and residential
spaces. But is this the whole story?
In the last decade, the Univer-
sity has transformed itself into an
institution that is run for-profit
and increasingly tied to Wall Street
investment banks, hedge funds and
institutional investors. In the turn
to profit, the University has decided
to pursue wealthy out-of-state stu-
dents who can pay outrageously high
tuition. To do so, it has had to borrow
extensively to build new buildings
and facilities that would attract such
students:As of Dec. 31,2012, the Uni-
versity had $1.8 billion in outstand-
ing - primarily construction - debt
secured by general revenues which
include student tuition. This has
meant developing relationships with
investment banks and institutional
investors who buy the University's
construction bonds. These inves-
tors, however, will buy bonds only if
they are very secure: As a result, the
University, like many other universi-
ties, has offered up student's future
tuition as collateral for this debt and
engaged in aggressive campaigns'
against unionized and precarious
workers' wages and benefits.
Large donations are a critical
part of this strategy of building to
attract wealthy consumers. One of
the hidden costs of large donations
for infrastructure is that they actu-
ally force the University deeper

into debt. For example, the Munger
graduate dorms' projected price
is $185 million. Of the $110 mil-
lion pledged by Munger, $100 mil-
lion will go toward construction,
so what began as a "donation" has
now turned into $85 million of debt
for the University. Such donations
don't address the needs of students;
rather, they advance the pet proj-
ects and educational ideologies of
the rich. If this donation is a "gift,"
is it most certainly in the form of a
Trojan Horse.
Donations are inherently anti-
democratic - a stealthy way to avoid
any kind of due process or checks on
university spending. If the Univer-
sity had decided outright to build a
$185-million dormitory, graduate
students - and undergraduates too,
since their debt is going to pay for
$85 million of it - would have had
something to say about the project.
Instead, because it was a dona-
tion there was no public discussion
about the project and no debate over
its need. Rather, there was only an
announcement from above.
Had the administration consult-
ed its graduate students, it might
have considered potential gender,
sex and trans-gender concerns
with such a project. The University
and Munger claim that "throwing"
students together will result in
the "liberation" and "creation" of
knowledge - "breaking down the
silos" - but it might actually result
in unsafe living conditions for many
groups, in particular queer-identi-
fied individuals, trans-people and
women. Moreover, at their esti-
mated current price point - $1,000
per month - the Munger dorms will
cost graduate student instructors 77
percent of their yearly income to
live there - truly, this is the libera-
tion we have been waiting for.
Given the amount of graduate
student ire after the dorm project's

announcement, it's clear the admin-
istration has overstepped on this
project. They've taken a donation
that a rich plutocrat hung in front
of their noses and are trapped into
building something that even they
don't want. The question is then
what to do about it?
The option we propose has two
parts. First, we should demand that
the University reject all donations
that come with strings attached.
This means we should demand
that the University return Mung-
er's donation. We must reject all
donations that contribute to the
financialization of the University
through construction bonds. and
student debt. As such, big spending
decisions should be made through a
democratic body composed of stu-
dents - graduate and undergradu-
ate - and workers from all areas
of the University and University of
Michigan Health System.
However, it seems unlikely that
the University will return the
Munger donation and even less
likely that they will include stu-
dents and workers in the decision-
making process on how funds are
allocated. That means that the only
way is to oppose the building proj-
ect through direct action. If you feel
strongly that the University should
not be spending $85 million on a
dorm that no one wants, if you feel
that the University should not be
tryingto avoid public discussions of
how resources are allocated, and if
you feel that the University should
not let itself become the site of the
educational experiments of con-
servatives and the far-right, we ask
you to join qs Nov.1 at 5 p.m. in Can-
terbury House for an open meeting
to discuss what steps we should
take next.

Whitener are Rackham students.

PARTY
From Page 1A
we all get together and discuss
the impact this unfortunate
event has had on the University
community, as well as our expec-
tations moving forward," Jones
said. "Obviously, the way the
party was both conceived of and
executed is in direct contradic-
tion to the standards of our uni-
versity."
Jones plans to meet with stu-
dents Thursday to discuss ways
* of remedying the situation, as
well as making sure their under-
lying concerns about racial issues
on campus are addressed. She
added that an e-mail informing
students of the discussion and
expressing disappointment will
be sent out Thursday to address a
largely "negative" situation.
While Jones stopped short of
calling events like this a trend,
she said it's clear that some
level of education and dialogue
is necessary to ensure that stu-
dents are aware what language
and behavior is appropriate, and
how cultural appropriation has
potential for harm.
"In society we certainly see
examples, not only in parties
but in the media and how people
present themselves; it's certainly
not a problem unique to Greek
Life or our campus," Jones said.
"The incident in question was
not only racially offensive, but
degrading to women in general,
and the most restorative way to

tions that you need a safe environ-

space to have honest conversa-

to be open with each other."
By fostering a dialogue among
the students, Gonzilez hoped to
make a sensitive subject more
comfortable to confront.

grams that focus on increasing
the variety of projects that Infor-
mation students can apply their
skills to.

Jeff MacKie-Mason, dean of
the School of Information, said.
Wednesday that the initiative
aligns with the school's strategic
goals of harnessing the power of
applied information to improve
people's lives.
"We've always known and
believed in the power of experi-
mental learning," MacKie-Mason
said. "We want to increase the
amount of that, with a particular-
ly strong focus on service."
MacKie-Mason convened a
strategic planning session three
years ago when he assumed his
post, succeeding Martha Pollack,
who is now University Provost.
He added that faculty, students
and staff were consulted to ensure
the program's goals aligned with
the needs and aspirations of the
different constituencies.
Judy Lawson, the School of,
Information assistant dean of
academic and student affairs, said
MacKie-Mason's efforts as dean
have refocused the school's mis-
sion.
"Our dean has recommitted the

move forward is to provide edu-
cation on why this is not accept-
able."
The fraternity is in the process
of drafting an apology to the stu-
dents who came forward, which
will later be broadly circulated
as a means of accepting respon-
sibility for their situation, Jones
said.
LSA junior Geralyn Gaines,
secretary for the Black Student
Union, described her initial reac-
tion to the event as "complete
and utter disgust." She said this
was the first time she's personal-
ly experienced racism on campus
or felt specifically targeted and
attacked.
"I love U of M and even today
I'm fundamentally happy, but it's
scary to think that I sit in class
with people who think this way
and people that agree with them,
people who legitimately thought
this party was a good idea and
was okay," Gaines said. "The
invitation amplified stereotypes
and used a level of disgusting
language that it was evident they
actively tried to offend us."
Gaines said she was particu-
larly offended by the use of the
word "ratchet," which she says
is prominently used in the Black
community to describe some-
thing terrible or someone who
doesn't know how to handle
themselves. She also took issue
with the invitees section, which
specifically asked for "bad bitch-
es" and "rachet pussy," which
she believes was an attempt to
make a mockery of Black culture.
Gaines believes that requir-

ing the University to approve all
,party themes moving forward
would help avoid similar issues
in the future.
Music, Theatre & Dance
senior Erica Nagy said she was
compelled to write a formal com-
plaint after seeing the emotional
toll the situation took on her
roommate.
"We were all mad and found
the situation unacceptable, espe-
cially after seeing how upset
she'd been the whole day after
carrying this hurt around with
her," Nagy said. "You don't have
to be a certain race to be offend-
ed by racist material; I think
anyone who isn't offended isn't
paying attention."
She specifically took issue
withthe factthat no one involved
in the fraternity identified with
Black culture and that they used
language "that wasn't theirs to
use" in an attempt to directly
offend people.
Though this was the first time
she had been invited to a party
with an offensive theme, Nagy
she knows it happens often -
both in and out of Greek Life -
because people don't understand
the ramifications of cultural
appropriation.
"I guess my hope for all of this
is that it starts a conversation
about race on this campus so that
people can learn thattheir words
and actions truly affect other
people," she said. "I don't want to
see (Theta Xi) punished because
I don't think that would solve the
true problem here; we need to
get people talking and learning."

REFORM
From Page 1A
city's zoning codes, which is at
the core pf our platform."
Perhaps the most important
tenet of Brown's campaign is the
idea of implementing a policy of
mixed-use zoning rather than
the city's current single-use
zoning policy. This essentially
means Brown and his party
endorse the usage of city zones
for more than simply one pur-
pose - whether it be residential,
commercial, etc. Brown hopes
this type of policy will alleviate,
if not solve, many of the city's
pressing issues.
Brown argued that the .gov-
ernment of Ann Arbor has been
trying to control the use of cer-
tain zones for too long, and such
a policy has been hurting the
city rather than helping it in
many instances.
"Sometimes the best govern-
ment solution is no government
solution," Brown said. "We need
to give more flexibility and free-
dom to property owners and
communities to address their
own problems rather than the
other way around, and I think
that's what Ann Arbor needs
right now."
The issue of urban sprawl is
especially important in Brown's
platform, as he believes the
suburban, residential areas are
becoming too far removed from
more highly commercialized

areas. He attributed many prob-
lems to sprawl, such as higher
traffic, pedestrian safety and
student discrimination.
"If we really want to change
this in the future, because
zoning reform is not going to
change these problems over-
night including parking, we
have to ensure that more people
live in the city, and mixed-use
zoning will allow this to hap-
pen," Brown said.
Brown also discussed the
ways students are affected by
zoning laws. He and many other
Mixed Use Party candidates
have said current zoning practic-
es discriminate against students,
particularly codes about frater-
nities, sororities and co-ops.
He specifically noted his
desire to abolish the part of the
zoning code that forbids more
than four students from living
together in any single unit where
one bathroom and kitchen is
shared, calling the law "unpro-
ductive" and "backwards think-
ing."
"The code itself states how a
functional family does include
a fraternity, co-ops, or any kind
of association that is considered
temporary," Brown said. "The
law itself specifically mentions
students, so the law was never
meant for safety reasons. It was
more or less a discriminatory
law."
Another issue pertaining to
students raised by Brown is that
of consistency of punishment in
cases of minors in possession of

alcohol. While he noted that Ann
Arbor residents would not find
such an issue pertinent, he noted
that much of the city's policies
regarding illegal substances are
inconsistent, specifically with
regards to minors caught pos-
sessing alcohol versus possessing
marijuana, as marijuana posses-
sion is treated as a civil infrac-
tion.
He also noted that-while he
and Lumm may agree on some
things, Lumm is not offering real
reforms some of these issues.
As a candidate, Brown said he
has gotten a lot of positive feed-
back in his ward, and he noted
that a lot of people are sympa-
thetic to his party.
"Conservatives love the fact
that I don't abide by tax incre-
ment financing," he said. "Lib-
erals love the fact that I want to
create more affordable housing
and make Ann Arbor a place
where everyone can live."
Brown said he is not simply
running because he thinks he
can win, but he wants to bring a
fresh perspective into city poli-
tics.
"I'm fighting an uphill battle,"
Brown said. "I didn'trunbecause
I thought I could win hands-
down. I ran because I wanted to
bring real issues to the table and
express the kind of voice that is
needed in these debates because
if we didn't, we'd still have the
same two type of status quo can-
didates bickering over the same
issues without offering real sub-
stance."


a private matter, but it's actually
a social disease," Gonzilez said.
"It's very preventable. That's
why I'm here doing community
education - because I think
that's the first step of preven-
tion."
One student raised his hand
and asked, "How do you respond
if a friend comes to you and con-
fides in you that they are being
abused?"Another student asked
what to do if the victim does not
want to seek help.
Although it is common to
become frustrated with victims
of domestic violence who refuse
to leave their abusers, Gonzalez
stressed the importance of a
non-judgmental support system.

"Statistics say it takes a vic-
tim seven to eight (incidents of
abuse) to leave," she said.
Business senior Yash Bhuta-
da, co-chair of SAAN, thought
the event was a success.
"I think it was really nice to
talk about something serious
in a comfortable and safe set-
ting and, hopefully, people go,
out and are comfortable talking
about these issues, spreading it
onto their friends who weren't
able to come to the event,"
Bhutada said.
SAAN hosts SAAN Talks
twice a month. Each talk aims
to generate a dialogue on a spe-
cific'topic. Recent talks have been
focused on bullying and identity.

chance to get involved.
But leaders say a smaller
cohort will allow each intern to
develop a close relationship with
the executive officer they are
assigned to, something that Busi-
ness sophomore Kevin Ziegler
found to be the most valuable
part of his experience as intern
to former CSG treasurer Chris
Osborn, an LSA senior.
"He took a personal invest-
ment, making sure he helped
develop me as a leader and as a

professional," Ziegler said. "He
actually sat down as often as he
could and just held a little bit
of training sessions in various
areas."
This year's intern class has

Team defeats
St. Louis Cardinals
6-1 in game six
BOSTON (AP) - Jubi-
lant Red Sox fans took to the
streets around Fenway Park
to cheer their team's, World
Series victory Wednesday
night, the first time Boston
has won baseball's fall classic
at home in 95 years.
Fans chanted and caroused
outside the ballpark and nearby
bars after Boston vanquished
the St. Louis Cardinals 6-1 in
Game 6. Several fans were seen
giving high fives to police offi-
cers.
"Words cannot describe how
I feel," said Sam D'Arrigo. "This
is what being a Boston fan is all
about."
An excited Boston Mayor
Tom Menino tweeted: "Get
the ducks ready, we're having a
parade."
The Red Sox have now won
three World Series in a decade,
but they hadn't won at home
since 1918.
Police reported no signifi-
cant problems immediately fol-
lowing the game but said they
were ready for post-game cel-
ebrations and any unruly fans.

Throughout the night, the
department tweeted caution-
ary messages, encouraging fans
to "Celebrate with pride" and
"Celebrate responsibly."
In St. Louis, fans were disap-
pointed that the Cardinals lost.
Many watched the game 1,200
miles away from the comfort
of their couches. Some tour-
ists favored the 26th-floor view
of the Gateway Arch over the
play-by-play of a third cgnsecu-
tive loss in a series that earlier
looked like it could have ended
at Busch Stadium after the Car-
dinals won two of the first three
games.
"It's pretty quiet in here,"'
said Coltier Blakely of Mexico,
Mo., who was in town for a
statewide meeting of commu-
nity college administrators.
Earlier in Boston, President
Barack Obama delivered a talk
on his embattled health care
reform. He departed Boston an
hour before the game began.
Police and bomb-sniffing
dogs swept through Fenway as
hundreds of fans gathered out-
side in the afternoon. Scores of
officers stood outside the park,
directing traffic, giving direc-
tions to fans and standing ready
for what was likely to be a long
night.
Boston has hosted sever-

al celebrations over the last
decade as the Celtics, Patriots,
Bruins and Red Sox have all
won titles since 2004, but some
of the post-championship par-
tying has caused problems. In
2004, a 21-year-old college stu-
dent was killed-by a pepper pel-
let fired by Boston police during
crowd-control efforts following
the Red Sox win in the Ameri-
can League Championship
Series. In 2008, a 22-year-old
man died after police took him
into custody during street cel-
ebrations of the Celtics' title.
Chris LeBlanc of Glocester,
R.I., skipped class last spring
to watch the Red Sox's sea-
son opener. On Wednesday he
was at Fenway with his father
Michael, hoping to score tick-
ets.
Despite a dismal 2012 season
LeBlanc,,18, said he always felt
good about the team's chances
this year. "I was optimistic," he
said.
Michael LeBlanc, 45, shook
his head and smiled. He
remembers well the decades
of disappointment, the talk of
curses and the blown chanc-
es. He knows what a treat it is
to have a shot at three World
Series wins in a decade.
"He doesn't know how good
he has it," he said.


school towards core values that
we've had throughoutcour history,
but now we want to make those
values and act on them in a more
forward-thinking way in.terms of
getting our students involved in
makinga difference in the world,"
Lawson said.
Some of the programs support-
ed by the initiative include new
community impact projects link-
ing students to nonprofit orga-
nizations; a global information
engagement program, which will
send students to India to work on
information challenges starting
in 2014; and the Citizen Interac-
tion Design project, which will
develop a partnership between
the School of Information and the
city of Jackson, Mich.
The Office of the Provost pro-
vided the funds for the glob-
al information engagement
program, which Lawson said
reflects the idea that the initiative
will grow tobe a University-wide
effort.
"It's driven from students; it's
driven from faculty and from
staff," Lawson said. "We see the
huge impact it has on the student
experience and we have advocat-
ed for this expansion as well."
The initiative will also pro-
vide more support for the school's
Alternative Spring Break - one
of its flagship programs. The pro-
gram gives students the oppor-

tunity to work at public sector
organizations over spring break
and participation has risen from
about 40 students to 130 students
over the past few years.
Some of the program's funds
will provide grants for students'
international internships, unpaid
internships and student organiza-
tions focused on data and infor-
mation-related projects. Students
will begin receiving aid in time
for the 2014 summer internship
season.
In describing the fund's
impact, Lawson highlighted
A2DataDive, a student-led proj-
ect that helps nonprofits handle
their data. Founded by Univer-
sity alum Nikki Roda in 2011, the
program has hosted two DataD-
ive events, where students help
teach nonprofits how to-handle
their data over the course of a
weekend workshop. The pro-
gram began receiving financial
support through the program
this year.
Priya Kumar, an Information
graduate student and co-leader
of A2DataDive, said the program
has allowed her toput her knowl-
edge to work in the organization's
projects.
"It's kind of like you get to visu-
alize and see whatyou're learning
in the classroom," Kumar said.
"That's the most powerful ele-
ment of doing the DataDive."

Shooter kills
girlfriend, her
parents, two
children and himself
GREENWOOD, S.C. (AP) -
Bryan Sweattwas inthe middle of
a custody fight with his girlfriend
over their 7-month-old daughter
and facing a burglary charge that
could put him in jail for years.
His girlfriend's father had
warned him to stay away from
his house and the dirt track
Sweatt had built in the backyard
for his all-terrain vehicles.
Then on Tuesday afternoon,
Sweatt broke into the parents'
house and waited for them and
the girlfriend to come home,
police said. When they did, Swe-
att fatally shot his girlfriend, her
parents and two children living
there, before turning the gun
on himself, Greenwood County
Sheriff Tony Davis said.

"Once you see a horrific scene
like this it never leaves you. It's
with you day in and day out," he
said.
The victims were identified
as Richard Fields, 51; his wife,
Melissa Fields, 49; their daughter
ChandraFields, 26; andtwoofthe
couple's grandchildren who lived
with them: William Robinson, 9;
and Tariq Robinson, 11.
Davis didn't specify a motive
for the shootings, but said it
appears they stemmed from a
"domestic violence situation."
He said Sweatt felt that Chan-
dra Fields wasn't allowing him
to see their infant child often
enough. The girl was not among
the dead.
He said that Sweatt had called
911 while he was in the Fields'
house, stating that he was on the
edge and contemplating suicide,
before hanging up.
It's unclear how many - if any
- victims had been shot before
he made the call at 5:54 p.m.
Tuesday. A police report said a

dispatcher heard a woman in the
background say: "Do not point
that at me" before the call was
disconnected,
Sweatt allowed four children
to escape - his 7-month-old
daughter, the infant's cousin and
two neighborhood children who
came to the door after school to
play with the Fields' grandchil-
dren.
No one knows why Sweatt let
them live and shot the others,
Davis said.
"I cannot tell you at this point
that I have all the answers for
you," he said.
While they're still searching
for clues, one thing is clear: Swe-
att's life was spinning out of con-
trol.
Sweatt has a lengthy arrest
record that dates back nearly a
decade, according to state police
records. Most of his charges were
related to property crimes, such
as burglary or forgery, although
he was arrested once on aggra-
vated assault charges.

The events of the last few days
mark a stunning turnaround for
the Congolese troops, who have
long been plagued by indisci-
pline and corruption among their
ranks, making them no match
for groups like M23, which until
recently was allegedly backed by
neighboring Rwanda.
M23 launched its movement
inApril 2012,becomingthelatest
reincarnation of an ethnic Tutsi
rebel group dissatisfied with the
Congolese government. Neigh-
boring Rwanda, whose president
is also an ethnic Tutsi, provided
weapons, recruits and training
to the M23, according to a report
by U.N experts. Rwanda's gov-
ernment denies the allegations,
saying Congo's government has
failed to police its territory.
The group has been substan-
tially weakened in the past year
by internal divisions and wan-
ing Rwandan support, according
to the U.N. Defections from the
M23 are up this month, total-
ing 80 in October. Thirty-three
surrendered alone on Tuesday,
according to chief U.N. spokes-
man Martin Nesirky.
The Congolese military has
capitalized on these rebel set-
backs by pushing ahead with
new offensives beginning in
August that have been support-
ed by a specially created United
Nations Intervention Brigade.

Second mistress in doctor's
murder trial takes, the stand

Utah man accused
of inducing his
wife's heart attack
to be with lover
PROVO, Utah (AP) - Another
mistress of a former Utah doctor
accused of killing his wife testi-
fied Wednesdaythathe had once
described how he could induce
a heart attack in someone that
would appear natural. .
Anna Walthall took the wit-
ness stand and said she began a
six-month affair with defendant
Martin MacNeill in 2005 when
he was a consulting doctor at a
laser hair removal clinic that she
operated.,
MacNeill described the heart
attack method during "pillow
talk," she said.
Walthall quoted MacNeill as

saying, "'There's something you
can give someone that's natu-
ral that's a heart attack that's
not detectable after they have a
heart attack."'
No cause of death has been
determined for Michele Mac-
Neill.
Defense lawyers have argued
that she had a heart attack and
fell into a bathtub in April 2007
in the family home in Pleasant
Grove, about 35 miles south of
Salt Lake City.
Defense lawyers challenged
Walthall by getting her to
acknowledge she had been diag-
nosed with what was formerly
called multiple personality dis-
order, but she insisted she was
giving a true account'of Martin
MacNeill's statement.
Earlier in the day, two daugh-
ters of the MacNeills testi-
fied that their father had hired
another mistress, Gypsy Willis,

as a nanny soon after his wife
died, but Willis did not cook or
take care of the children and
went to their father's bedroom
at night.
Sabrina MacNeill, 19, testified
that Willis didn't do anything a
nanny would be expected to do.
"She made spaghetti once,
and that was the only time she
cooked," said Sabrina MacNeill.
"She didn't do anything."
Another daughter, Alexis
Somers, testified that Willis
would come and go through-
out the day, seemingly more
focused on the doctor than the
children.
Prosecutors say Martin Mac-
Neill, 57, hounded his wife,
Michele MacNeill, to get cos-
metic surgery then knocked her
out with painkillers and left-her
to die in a bathtub. His motive,
they said, was to get rid of his
wife so he could be with Willis.

Revelations of
surveillance of E.U.
officials "shatters"
trust in negotiations
BRUSSELS (AP) - The back-
lash in Europe over U.S. spying
is threatening an agreement
that generates tens of billions of
dollars in trans-Atlantic busi-
ness every year - and nego-
tiations on another pact worth
many times more.
A growing number of Euro-
pean officials are calling for
the suspension of the "Safe
Harbor" agreement that lets
U.S. companies process com-
mercial and personal data -
sales, emails, photos - from
customers in Europe. This
little-known but vital deal
allows more than 4,200 Ameri-
can companies to do business
in Europe, including Internet
giants like Apple, Google, Face-
book and Amazon.
Revelations of the extent of
U.S. spying on its European
allies is also threatening to
undermine one of President
Barack Obama's top trans-
Atlantic goals: a sweeping free-
trade agreement that would add
an estimated $138 billion (100
billion euros) a year to each
economy's gross domestic prod-
uct.
Top EU officials say the trust
needed for the negotiations has
been shattered..
"For ambitious and com-
plex negotiations to succeed,
there needs to be trust among
the negotiating partners," EU
Justice Commissioner Viviane

Reding said Wednesday in a
speech at Yale University.
At the very least, the Euro-
peans are expected to demand
that the U.S. significantly
strengthen its privacy laws to
give consumers much more
control over how companies
use their personal data - and
extend those rights to Europe-
an citizens, maybe even giving
them the right to sue American
companies in U.S. courts.
The Europeans had long been
pressing these issues with the
Americans. But since former
National Security Agency con-
tractor Edward Snowden began
to leak surprising details on the
extent of U.S. surveillance in
Europe, the European demands
have grown teeth.
"I don't think the U.S. gov-
ernment can be convinced by
arguments or outrage alone,
but by making it clear that
American interests will suf-
fer if this global surveillance is
simply continued," said Peter
Schaar, the head of Germany's
data protection watchdog.
One sanction the European
Union could slap on the U.S.
would be to suspend the Safe
Harbor deal, which allows
American businesses to store
and process their data where
they want. It aims to ensure that
European customers' data are
just as safe as in Europe when
handled in-the U.S.
"But if you look at the U.S.
legal environment, there is no
adequate legal protection for
EU citizens," said the European
Parliament's leading data pro-
tection lawmaker Jan Philipp
Albrecht after talks with U.S.
officials in Washington.

Run effort may be futile

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
To beat Michigan State, his-
tory dictates Michigan has to
win the running game. But this
year's results suggest that might
be futile.
To beat Michigan State, the
popular narrative in the media
says the Wolverines must be the
more physical team. But offensive
style could demand finesse and
speed.
The Spartans' defense requires
Michigan take special care to
avoid turnovers. But the Wolver-
ines' best offensive weapons are
on the outside.
By Michigan coach Brady
Hoke's own reckoning, Michigan
is still searching for an identity.
Heading into a week with major
Legends Division implications,
it faces a series of choices about
what kind of team it seeks to be.
Does it run, despite limited pro-
duction in the ground game? Can'
it be a spread team and physical at
the same time? Will the threat of
turnovers turn Michigan squea-
mish in the passing game?
All week, players spoke of the
rivalry's physicality and nasti-
ness. Part of it is pride. Michigan
feels as if it were bullied by Mich-
igan State in East Lansing two
years ago. It doesn't just want to
run, it wants to dominate on the
ground.
"This is Michigan," said fifth-
year senior running back Fitzger-
ald Toussaint. "We're not gonna
go out there, we're not gonna get
punked by nobody. We're going
to stand up, and we're gonna hit
them in the mouth. That simple."
Michigan is probably justified
in emphasizing the ground game:
In 40 of the past 43 matchups
between Michigan and Michigan
State, the team that won the rush-
ing battle won the game.
"I saw that somewhere," Hoke
said. "But there's also years when

PATRICK BARRON/Daily
Fifth-year senior running back Fitzgerald Toussaint had his biggest game of the season against Indiana, scoring four times.

it hasn't, so you have to do what's
best for you as a team when you
think you can have success."
Most of the time, though, a
heroic effort was required to win
despite trailing on the ground.
The last time it happened, in
2004, Brayloh Edwards bailed
out a running game that was out-
rushed 368 to 223. Then, he made
two highlight-reel catches in
the fourth quarter to help erase
a 17-point deficit in less than six
minutes. In overtime, he caught
a third.
Barring a major turnaround
on the interior of the line, Michi-
gan may have to find a way to win
other than on the ground. The
Wolverines are 75th in the nation
in rushing yards per attempt,
and they have shuffled linemen
for much of the year. This week,
freshman Kyle Bosch and red-
shirt freshman Erik Magnuson
will both start at guard. Tous-
saint has eclipsed 100 yards just
once this season. And the Spar-
tans rank first in the nation in
rushing defense - by a wide mar-
gin - with less than 55 yards per
game.
"Oh, it's a huge test," said
offensive coordinator Al Borges.
In two years under Hoke and

Borges, Michigan State has lim-
ited Michigan to just 26 points.
Borges identified two keys to
beating the Michigan State
offense. One, he said, was giving
"your skill guys a chance to do
what they do best, whether it be
in the open field or around the
line of scrimmage.
"If you're getting hit in the
backfield as soon as you hand
the ball off, you're not going any-
where. And they've done a lot of
that."
Borges has shown a willing-
ness to let the inside running
game develop. Last week, he said
he considers his offense a down-
hill running team with spread*
elements. But when Michigan's
offense has been most explosive
- in wins over Notre Dame and
Indiana - it has spread the field
and attacked the edge.
That would avoid Michigan
State's signature A-gap blitzes,
which wreak havoc on opposing
offenses in the middle. But that
would also require a shift in phi-
losophy.
Borges says his coaching histo-
ry shows that some years he runs
more and some years he passes
more. The deciding factor is: who
are his personnel?

"I said this before, I think good
offenses are the perfect mix of
finesse and physicality," Borges
said.
But he said he gets excited at
the physicality. And he still wants
to run.
"As a competitor, as a human
being, I love these games," Borg-
es said. "I love it. This is why I
coach."
Now, Michigan's person-
nel seem to suggest pass. Since
Michigan has shifted sopho-
more tight end Devin Funchess
to split end, Michigan's passing
game has flourished. Last game,
against Indiana, redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner set
the Michigan record for passing
yards. But Michigan State has a
stout secondary. Cornerback Dar-
queze Dennard, Hoke said, "is a
high-round pick." Plus, the Spar-
tans have propensity for scoring
off turnovers, and Gardner has
shown a propensity for givingthe
ball away.
Saturday, then, should provide
a look at what kind of team Michi-
gan will be for the rest of the Big
Ten season. If it doesn't find the
absent running game early, it
must adapt quickly, or it could be
a long game for the offense.

Another Akron chapter added

ByJOHN KOPKO
For theDaily
The last time the Michigan
men's soccer team clashed with
Akron, in 2012, a trip to the third
round of the NCAA Tournament
was on the line. The Zips were
undefeated on their home turf,
and the Wolverines had won six
of their last seven.
Then, Michigan's Colin McA-
tee was shown a red card after
kicking Akron's Robbie Der-
schang in the head. The Zips took
a two-goal lead and held off a late
charge by the Wolverines to send
the visitors back to Ann Arbor
empty handed.
The last time Akron came to
Ann Arbor, in 2011, it was ranked
fourth in the nation. Michigan
# midfielder Latif Alashe scored a
stunning overtime goal to shock
to Zips and propel the Wolver-
ines to a 1-0 victory.
The recent history between
the teams has developed into
nothing less than a rivalry.
"For sure, it is 100 percent (a
rivalry). This isn't a rivalry like
Ohio State and Michigan State,"
said junior captain Tyler Arnone.
"This is a respectful rivalry
(because) we know two good
teams are going toe-to-toe with
each other."
The setting was similar on
Wednesday - a calm, clear night
in Ann Arbor. Michigan (3-2-0
Big Ten, 7-4-3 overall) came into
the game riding a three-game
home win streak. Meanwhile,
No. 17 Akron (4-1-0 Mid-Amer-
ican Conference, 11-3-1) was
undefeated in its last five con-
tests.
Both teams fielded freshmen
who did not take part in the tour-
nament showdown the previous
season, or the stunning upset the
year before that.
But fresh faces didn't help the
Wolverines, and for the second
meeting in a row, Akron defeated
Michigan, 2-1.
The Zips' offense started the
game fast, displaying well-timed
runs and well-placed crosses. In
the fifth minute, Akron freshman
midfielder Adam Najem found

Senior midfielder Fabio Pereira led Michigan in shots on goal on Wednesday, with two.

space outside the box and curled
a shot over the fingertips of the
Wolverines keeper, redshirt
junior Adam Grinwis, rattling off
the crossbar and bouncing away.
For Michigan the score line
was eerily similar to last year's
loss in the NCAA Tournament
- a physical battle, a relentless
Akron attack and a commanding
performance by the Zips.
"If you look at Michigan-
Akron in the past five or six
years, the games weren't really
even close with regards to qual-
ity of play," said Michigan coach
Chaka Daley. "Last year, they
dominated us."
The Michigan offense finally
kicked into gear only in the clos-
ing minutes of the first half. With
33 seconds left, senior defender
Ezekiel Harris collected a loose
ball at the top of the box follow-
ing a set piece and drove a low
volley into the corner of the net
to bring the Wolverines within a
goal.
The second half brought out a
rejuvenated Wolverine offense.
In the first 10 minutes, Michigan
put pressure on the Zips' defense.

Aggressive play generated three
quick shots and a corner, but the
Wolverines failed to capitalize on,
their chances.
As the clock ticked away, most
of the possession for both teams
came in the middle third of the
field. The teams swapped shots
and scoring opportunities, but
good defending and goalkeeper
play kept the score at 2-1.
The physicality of the rivalry
continued to heat up as Michi-
gan desperately searched for an
equalizer.
In the 77th minute, McA-
tee went hard into a tackle and
knocked Najem to the turf. In
a scene similar to last season's
meeting, McAtee was shown a
card and players on both sides
had to be restrained as words
were exchanged. Less than two
minutes later, Akron defenseman
Saad Abdul-Salaam was shown a
card for bringing down a Michi-
gan defender.
With less than 10 minutes to
play in the half, the Wolverine
attack began to pressure the
Zips' back line again. In the 85th
minute, McAtee got his head

on a cross and directed the ball
toward an open goal. The- ball
clipped the bottom of the cross-
bar and was cleared away by the
Akron defense.
The Wolverines still would
not go away. In the 90th minute,
the Akron goalkeeper slipped as
he attempted a clearance, and
the ball skipped right to Michi-
gan's leading scorer, James Mur-
phy. Murphy fired a shot, but his
attempt was weak and the Zips'
keeper caught the ball to seal the
Wolverines fate.
"Even though we came out
on the wrong side of the result
tonight, I still felt it was a good
game," Arnone said.
To Daley, the 'growing his-
tory between the two soccer pro-
grams signifies the level of play
that Michigan soccer wants to
be at.
"We're aspiring to be on
(Akron's) level on a consistent
basis. They put it all together
for longer stretches than we
did," Daley said. "That's part of
their culture, and that's the cul-
ture we're trying to create here
amongst Michigan soccer."

By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
If Saturday's game at Michi-
gan State will indeed be the
Michigan football team's most
physical of the season, it's only
fitting that Kyle Bosch be on the
offensive line for it.
"You never. have to worry
about him likingcontact and him
being aggressive," said Greg Pur-
nell, Bosch's former high-school
coach at Wheaton (Ill.) St. Fran-
cis, ina phone interview with the
Daily on Wednesday. "The fact
that he's been aggressive all his
life I'm sure has helped."
Earlier this week in practice,
redshirt junior linebacker Jake
Ryan learned just how strong the
freshman's feisty side is. Bosch
found himself in a scuffle with
Ryan, one of the leaders of the
defense, and fifth-year senior left
tackle Taylor Lewan needed to
intervene.
"It was just practice," Ryan
said Monday when asked about
the incident. "Bosch is a great
player. He stepped up the last
game for us, It was practice. We
got into it. It's over We're friends
again."
The fact that Bosch took it
upon himself to get into it with
one of the team captains isn't
surprising to Purnell in the
least. He recalls a practice dur-
ing Bosch's junior year when he
ended up in a similar scuffle -
"It wasn't a fight, but it could've
led to that," Purnell recalled.
What is a surprise to Purnell is
that Bosch is listed as Michigan's
starter at guard entering Satur-
day's battle for the Paul Bunyan
Trophy.
Perhaps that says more about
the Wolverines' lack of depth at
the offensive line positions than
Bosch's first-year progress, but
coach Brady Hoke certainly has
enough trust in the 6-foot-5, 302-
pound Bosch to insert him into a
very hostile environment in East

Lansing.
"I like Bosch," Hoke said in
his Wednesday press conference.
"You grow up sometime. But
yeah, it'll be intense. But I know
one thing about Bosch: He's a
pretty tough guy."
That toughness showed up in
Bosch's first career game, against
Indiana, when he was apart of an
improved Wolverines offensive
line. Needless to say, facing the
Spartan defense is another mat-
ter entirely, but it's a task Hoke
thinks the line will be ready
for. But redshirt freshman Erik
Magnuson will also be lining up
at guard again, and that youth
could' be a liability in a rivalry
game, especially one on the road.
"I think with (Bosch and Mag-
nuson), the good thing is, there's
nine other guys out there with
them," Hoke said. "Believe me,
there's other guys who will be
out there for the first time with
more significant roles."
Purnell compared Bosch play-
ing against Michigan State this
weekend to games he played
against rival Lombard (Il.)
Montini Catholic in high school,
Montini Catholic has won four
consecutive state titles and
beat Bosch's St. Francis team
each year he was there, but that
doesn't mean Bosch didn't show
up in those games.
"He played very well in those
games," Purnell recalled. "Kyle
feels very badly we never beat
them during his tenure."
But Bosch has a chance Satur-
day to beat a rival his first time
playing in the game. That's an
opportunity he won't take light-
ly.
"He's mean," Lewan, the
peacekeeper, said Monday: "He
might not know every call. But I
know, when I was on the field my
freshman year, I was going 100
percent trying to take somebody
out every single play. ... Bosch
has that same thing about him.
I'm excited about him."

Sophomore goaltender Steve Racine has missed three games with a groin injury.

last season.
"We're all the same age, and
we've all been together for a few
years," Allen said. "Me and Tyler
have been together before that,
so I think we have a lot in com-
mon on the ice and off the ice."
The NTDP plays across the
country against top Division I
opponents every season, making
the program a recruiting hotbed
for college coaches. Before the
season, Berenson and his assis-
tants hoped the trio could fill
the production void left by for-
mer Wolverines Jacob Trouba
and Jon Merrill. They have done
so thus far, and the reassurance
these freshmen have provided
has made coaching worthwhile
for Berenson.
"Part of the reason I'm still
coaching is I look forward to
seeing the players we've recruit-
ed finally get here and see what,
they can do on the ice," Berenson
said. "These players have lived
up to their early season expecta-
tions."
PEARSON RETURNS TO
YOST: Michigan Tech coach
Mel Pearson, a former Michigan

assistant under Berenson for 23
years, will make his first trip
back to Ann Arbor this weekend
after taking a position as head
coach of the Huskies after the
2010-11 season.
In those two years, Pearson
has led Michigan Tech to its
second-best two-season stretch
in program history with 29 total
wins.
Perhaps none of those wins
were more meaningful than
shutting out Michigan in the
2011 Great Lakes Invitational,
when the Huskies went on to win
their first GLI title since 1981.
For Berenson and Pearson, it
will be a battle between teacher
and student. For the Wolverine
seniors, it will be a shot to beat
the coach that recruited some of
them to Michigan. There will be
mixed emotions on both benches
come Friday night.
"He was a really, really good
coach," said senior captain Mac
Bennett. "He was someone I
looked forward to practicing
with. It's kind of strange (seeing
him onthe otherbench),because
he was here when I got here."

The pitfalls of
overconsumption

LARPing events are spread out all throughout the Midwest.
*LARPig brings
diehards together

It's the end of another
stressful week - packed
with the usual slew of
things to do, places to be and
people to see - and I still have
three novels
and four
scripts to
read, decades
of film his-
tory to catch
up on and
two papers
to draft. But, CARLY
seriously KEYES
earning a
breather
from academia, I plop down on
the couch and turn on my TV.
I learn that James Spader is
back on primetime as America's
most wanted criminal-turned-
crime fighter (think Hannibal
Lecter meets Jack Bauer). So,
five episodes later (which at
this point is, of course, every
episode to date), Friday night is
gone forever.
There's no question I
could've been more produc-
tive with my time and made
some healthier decisions like
exercising or reading a book.
But this isn't another knock on
digital obsession. I'm perfectly
content with how I spent those
six hours decompressing on the
couch and immersing myself
in Spader's oozing charm and
sexy wit.
I'm just simply wondering:
Why allfive episodes? And even
if I had taken the higher road
and gone for a run or delved
into my copy of "Adaptation," I
guarantee I'd have logged eight
miles and finished the book in
one sitting. Why does one of
anything never seem enough?
The day after my Spader-fest,
I went to Costco. Talk about
excessive: It's like a playground
for adult consumers where they
swing through the bulk gro-
cery department and climb on
the piles of discount designer
clothes while the "chaperones"
stationed throughout the area
offer them complimentary
refreshments.
But now, when the bell rings
and I re-enter the real world,
I'm usually down a couple hun-
dred dollars from buying things
I don't need. My shelves are
stocked with glasses, and still,
I couldn't turn down a 20-pack

said. "And it's been kind of up

really big for a few years."
"The last maybe two years it
was a little bit of a down time for
a lot of people," Carrie added.
"And now it's starting to pick
up. More and more people are
showing interest in it now than
in the last one or two years."
Todd and Carrie explained
how the portrayal of LARPing
in the mainstream media differs
from the reality. Carrie specifi-
cally addressed "Role Models."
"That is more like a very true
LARP," Carrie explained. "And
Dagorhir is more physical than
that. There's a lot less actual
role-playing. We pick names for
ehch other and we wear funny
clothes and whatnot, but we
don't really act out our deaths,
and we don't have magic and we
don't go over the top with being
dramatic. Some people do, and
it's kind of amusing, but it's not
the focus of Dagorhir."
"There's such a wide variety
between people who completely
do role-playing and very little
fighting, to the complete oppo-
site side of the spectrum, where
there's almost all fighting and
very little role-playing," Todd

SCREAMS
From Page 1B
Josh McDaniel doesn'tlook like
someone who scares people for a
living. Open-faced, soft-spoken,
lightly built and perpetually smil-
ing, he's the type of guy who most
would expect to hold their arm,
kindly guiding them through a'
dark room should they lose their
way.
On general occasions, he proba-
bly is that guy, but every weekend,
he becomes a deranged lunatic,
terrorizing any paying customer
that has the misfortune of stum-
bling in front of him at Ypsilanti's
Night Terrors, one of Michigan's
most established haunted houses.
"The goal is to leave people
traumatized. And this is pretty
much the only time and place
where that's OK," McDaniel said.
He plays an unhinged filmmak-
er with a southern drawl, pleading
innocent spectators to sample his
twisted videography once they
enter his "scene," codename for
the room or space in which he's
tasked with "entertaining" cli-
ents.
"In the pre-scene, customers-
get to see these messed-up, home-
made films, with the grossest stuff
you can imagine. Then I get right
in their faces and say 'Did you see
mah movies? What'd you thank
of 'em? You ain't just sayin' that
cuz I'm here are ya?' " McDaniel
said. "People will always think,
'Just say yes to him. Just say yes,'
and then I hit a really high note
with 'Thanks for your criticism,'
which is somehow weird enough
to prime them for the rest of the
house."
Before moving to Michigan

was already a performer by trade.
He did stand-up comedy and fre-
quently worked in professional
stage productions, an experience
he cites as having helped him in
his terrorizing role.
In order to secure a job at the
haunted house, he, like the count-
less other regular employees he
works with, had to audition for
specific openings that managers
advertised.
"It's almost like the NFL draft,"
said manager Jim Connors.
"There are six event managers,
each responsible for a different
attraction, and we just kind of sit
down and argue among ourselves
about why certain actors would
work best where."
The audition consisted of a line
reading and scene test, where
McDaniel had to effectively use a
prop to create scares. Despite the
highly professional setting, the
people working at Night Terrors
describe their weekend jobs as
something of an escape from the
typically mundane office life.
Chris Doemer, an actor who
has been working at Night Terrors
for two years, likened the haunted
house to an emotional release.
"I work for an office, just kind
of sitting in a room with no win-
dows and doing data entry, file.
work and 'sensitivity training,"
he said. "Doing something which
is kind of the polar opposite of
everyday living just allows you to
let out that aggression and feel the
adrenaline rush."
The job is also heavily reliant
onthe workers' capacity for physi-
cal exertion. Shifts typically last
the entire show-time, from 7:15
p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on Sundays and
Thursdays and even later on Fri-
days and Saturdays. Performers

for a large part of that duration or
prepare for the slew of customers
the haunted house usually draws.
"Sometimes, it can be like
removing cysts out of my body,
because you have to apply your-
self every night to be somebody
that you're clearly not. It can mess
with you," Doemer said.
The actors rehearse every line
assigned to them beforehand,
with small adjustments and addi-
tions made over the course of the
entire scare season, which began
on Sep. 27 and ends Halloween
night. Even the props, most of
which a technical staff has built
from scratch, are adjusted as man-
agers gauge how wellthe audience
is reacting to each.
Walking through the "ware-
house," where props are stored
and actors are prepped before
work nights, is like being thrust
behind the curtains of a morbid
Broadway production. Fake sev-
ered heads, smears of faux blood,
plastic gargoyles and fully func-
tional fog machines line the walls
and litter the floor. The scene is
framed perfectly by a haunting
organ melody, wafting through
from an unknown corner while
a large plastic sheet separates
the storage area and the makeup
room. At least 10 to 15 perform-
ers squeeze in front of plated wall
mirrors. Some are going through
makeup while others pace the
floor, practicing lines.
One actor, chewing on gummy
bears and silently mumbling his
script back to himself, refuses to
sit down for an interview. He's
getting in the zone. Stepping away
could ruin the whole process. A
supervisor motions onlookers
away.
The six managers are tasked
with coordinating everything to
a T, from positioning and organiz-
ing actors to overseeing techni-
cal difficulties with equipment.
Some, like Connors, have been
with the company for more than
two decades.
Connors knows every corner of
every square foot of the haunted
houses like the back of his hand.
Like the other managers, he
makes sure the actors are inter-
acting together cohesively like a
well oiled machine, but also works
with a team of technicians that
oversees any necessary modifica-
tions to the already gargantuan
facility.
"I started out strictly on a part-
time basis, and through the years,
my involvement increased as we
expanded." he said. "It got to
the point where I did a lot of the
building (and) design work, and it
all just kind of became a labor of
love - I had to enjoy what I was
doing."
Connors wanders through the
sprawling set of buildings like

has). He frequently calls attention
tothe levelof detail ineverysingle
scene. From rubbery imitation'
severed arms splayed out on false
operating tables to a Leatherface
lookalike wielding a chainsaw
and swinging on a cord suspend-
ed from the ceiling, it becomes
clear how much thought has gone
behind each embellishment.
The six attractions - The Ulti-
mate Haunted Barn, The Asylum,
The Mined Shaft, Alien Caged
Clowns, The Labyrinth and Hay-
ride of the Lost - are all main-
tained and planned individually.
Each is staffed by its own slate of
actors and usually managed bycthe
same supervisor.
All the rooms flow together
organically. Walking through,
Connors stresses how every
attraction could work as a stand-
alone haunted house.
"Typically, when we sit and
plan, the big thing that we really
concentrate on is the theme. We
want to carry a theme from the
beginning of an event to the end
of an event," Connors said.."I
think alot of other places just cre-
ate scene after scene of what they
think 'scary' is and there's no real
consistency to it."
The Mined Shaft is like a shrine
to a sense of claustrophobia. In
every scene, the walls are dark and
the hallways narrow. The entire
building seems to be caving in,
giving customers the feeling that
they're trapped ina faulting mine.
Toward the end of the tour, par-
ticipants have to kneel down and
squeeze through what can only be
described as an inverted bouncy
house, inflatable walls pushing in
on all sides as they shove their way
to the exit.
And does it work?
"I've seen a guy that was really
enthusiastic about being in the
front of the line who got scared,
turned around and literally ran
through a wall." Connors said.
"And you have to understand, our
events are very well built."
Anyone over the age, of 10 can

go in without adult supervision,
though it's highly recommended
to attend with a group of people.
Visitors have been known to lose
their way, curl up into the fetal
position and wait for someone to
come get them. At least one per-
son "goes to the bathroom" every
week. Needless to say, Night Ter-
rors doesn't hold back the hurt.
But the intriguing bit is how much
enthusiastic feedback these same,
terrified people are willing to give.
Some of the scariest parts of the
tours, including but not limited to
a giant mechanical goat head and
a plastic cadaver bound to a couch
attached to the ceiling, have been
added and modified specifically
because of the comments manag-
ers sometimes receive about par-
ticular sections of the haunted
houses notpackingenough punch.
Brandon Wiard, whose family
owns the haunted houses along
with the accompanying cider mill
and country fair, described how
it's important to make sure that
the identity of the attractions is
maintained despite tweaks and
alterations.
"Think of it like when you go to
see a really good movie that you
end up loving and immediately
want to go watch' it again," he
said. "If there's a really significant
change, you lose that effect."
Some people have made it a
tradition to come to the establish-
ment every year in preparation
for Halloween. These "veterans"
often times just show up to go
through the same attraction mul-
tiple times, looking to connect
with the actorsthat have been ter-
rifying them for years.
"We open the doors and we get
the phone calls and so many times,
the same people have been com-
ing year to year for so long that we
actually think of them in a scene
before we set it up," Wiard said.
This idea of growing with the
haunted houses is something
Wiard has experience with. Night
Terrors started up when he was
three years old and Wiard got

involved with the country fair
in his teens. As a youth, he was.
responsible for organizing and
coordinatingthe "kiddie" haunted
house, which he ran most days
after school.
"It was still a portion of the
night-time haunted house, but just
one monster running around," he
recounted. "But I used to love it.
I remember always coming home
without my voice because I'd be
screaming so much."
After taking a break from work-
ing in the family business, Wiard
returned three years ago, and
since then has been focusing on
perfecting Night Terrors. He's
cites a passion for his work, evi-
dent in the level of detail every
employee is happy to boast about,
as the most important driving fac-
tor for his work.
In every corner of the grounds,
you get the overwhelming sense
that everyone is enjoying what
they're doing. The managers are
casually joshing around with the
actors, jibing each other for set-
ting up equipment wrong or guid-
ing newbies through their first
night of scaring.
It's an eclectic mix of people,
but it's obvious they're all here
for the same reason: to celebrate
a joint love for anything creepy. I
think Connors summarized it best
when he showed off the Hayride
of the Lost.
He pointed at a small opening
into the woods where a make-
shift cabin had been constructed.
As a tractor carrying a group
of approximately 20 customers
pulled over next to it, an actor
burst out onto a small balcony and
shouted something along the lines
of, "You'll be so terrified, you'll
run like your hair is on fire!" .
Moments later, a jet of flame
erupted from a chimney-like
chute on top of the cabin. Connors
chuckled and pointed.
"Yup," he said. "It's that
look on their faces right there
- closest thing I'll get to free
entertainment."
