“Mcity” aims to 

enhance passenger 
safety by testing 
driverless cars 

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Summer Managing News Editor

On Monday morning, Michi-

gan’s 
leading 
auto-industry 

experts and government officials, 
alongside 
University 
leaders, 

gathered in a brand new city, 
“Mcity,” the world’s first con-
trolled vehicle test site designed 
to research and refine automated 
vehicle technology. The project 
aims to pave the way for mass-
market driverless cars.

With the sponsorship of 48 

top industry and auto companies, 
such as Honda, Ford and General 
Motors, Mcity was created by the 
University’s Mobility Transfor-
mation Center in collaboration 
with the Michigan Department of 
Transportation.

Located off of Baxter Road on 

the University’s North Campus, 
the facility itself is a 32-acre test 

track equipped with intersec-
tions, traffic lights, signs and sig-
nals, building facades, sidewalks 
and construction obstacles. Mcity 
even incorporates such minor 
details drivers may encounter on 
the road as faded lane markings, 
potholes and traffic signs covered 
in graffiti.

In an interview with the Daily, 

University President Mark Schlis-
sel said Mcity reflects the Uni-
versity’s ability to bring together 
different 
economic 
sectors, 

including technology, insurance, 
city planning and government at 
the local, state and federal levels 
in an effort to address a major 
societal problem: driver safety. 
He added that Mcity enhances 
the University of Michigan com-
munity by providing unparalleled 
research and employment oppor-
tunities for students of different 
backgrounds.

“It’s great for the University of 

Michigan,” Schlissel said “It pro-
vides educational and internship 
opportunities for students. It pro-
vides employment opportunities 
for our graduating engineers and 
other specialties. It involves 6 or 7 
different schools and colleges, so 

it’s really a fantastic project.”

In his speech to the roughly 

300 guests in attendance at the 
opening of Mcity, Schlissel said 
the University’s groundbreaking 
research in transportation safety 
and efficiency is in accordance 
with the University’s impressive 
history of innovation.

“Michigan was the first Uni-

versity to own and operate its 
own hospital, the first to teach 
aeronautical engineering, the first 
to create a program in human 
genetics, and we are the Univer-
sity that tested the Polio vaccine 
and proved it safe for the world,” 
Schlissel said. He added that 
Mcity has similar potential to 
leave a positive impact on soci-
ety by preventing driving-related 
deaths.

Kirk Steudle, director of the 

Michigan Department of Trans-
portation, also addressed the 
large crowd, expressing pride 
in not only the project itself, but 
also in the partnerships formed 
by Mcity between industry com-
petitors with a common goal to 
improve driver safety.

 Obama cites 

Dominguez’s expertise 

of global market in 

appointment

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Summer Managing News Editor

President 
Barack 
Obama 

announced his nomination of School 
of Public Policy and economics pro-
fessor Kathryn M. Dominguez to 
serve on the Federal Reserve Board 
Monday afternoon.

In his announcement, Obama said 

Dominguez’s expertise with foreign 
exchange policy would prove benefi-
cial in addressing issues within the 
global market.

“Dr. Dominguez has the proven 

experience, judgment, and deep 
knowledge of the financial system, 
monetary policy, and international 
capital markets to serve at the Fed-
eral Reserve during this important 
time for our economy,” he said.

If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, 

Dominguez will become the second 
faculty member of both the Ford 
School and Department of Econom-
ics to serve on the Board of Gover-
nors. 

Former Public Policy and eco-

nomics professor Edward Gramlich 
served on the board from 1997 to 
2005 and also chaired the Commit-
tee on Consumer and Community 
Affairs.

In a statement, University Presi-

dent Mark Schlissel lauded Domin-
guez for her reputation and expertise 
in global finances.

“Professor 
Dominguez 
is 
a 

renowned scholar and teacher with 
a well-deserved reputation as one of 
the world’s leading experts on global 
financial markets,” Schlissel said.

Munger graduate 
housing to open on 
Central Campus 

Living space designed 

to encourage 

collaboration and a 
balanced lifestyle

By EMMA KERR

Summer Editor in Chief

If you’re a graduate stu-

dent living in the new Munger 
Graduate Residences, climbing 
through dorm windows at night 
to get a strictly prohibited roof-
top view will not be part of your 
residential life experience.

Munger Graduate Residences 

will open its doors to nearly 
630 single graduate students in 
mid-August. The $155 million 
project includes a rooftop patio 
and running track overlook-
ing Michigan Stadium, in addi-
tion to entire floors dedicated 
to common spaces and study 
spaces for residents. The proj-
ect ultimately cost $30 million 
under the original budget of 
$185 million.

Each individual unit is part 

of a six or seven-bedroom 
suite, and though each resident 
has his or her own bathroom, 
kitchen and study spaces in the 
suite are shared. Suites were 
designed with interdisciplin-
ary collaboration in mind, Amir 
Baghdadchi, 
the 
University 

Housing’s Assistant Director of 
Communications, said during a 
tour Friday.

Graduate 
student 
Ashley 

Adams, a Planning Fellow who 
will be living at Munger Gradu-
ate Residences in the fall, said 
she and the other Planning Fel-
lows will organize programs 
and provide resources to resi-
dents.

“The building is beautiful, 

but the mission of the program 
was really a driver for me. I was 
a Planning Fellow, and so our 
student input was really valu-
able and even residents get to 
decide how they will want to 
use the space and it can adjust 
to their needs,” Adams said.

Students of at least four 

different areas of study are 

assigned to suites. Spaces like 
the theater-style multimedia 
room are all designed to cre-
ate a unique graduate experi-
ence and encourage students to 
explore areas of study outside of 
their own, Baghdadchi said.

“Housing is a way to bring 

people together who do differ-
ent kinds of things,” he said. 
“When you live next to each 
other, amazing things can hap-
pen.”

Living a balanced life was 

also an idea planners kept in 
mind when designing Munger 
Graduate Residences. The lower 
level includes a game room, the-
ater, and indoor bike rack. Stairs 
are lined with grooves to make 
moving bikes up and down from 
the bike storage area easier.

“If you don’t make it easy to 

live life with a bike, they won’t 
do it. So this is a way to nudge 
them toward that lifestyle,” 
Baghdadchi said.

Baghdadchi also said Mung-

er is on track to achieve Gold 
Leadership in Energy and Envi-
ronmental Design certification. 

The building exceeds energy 

efficiency code requirements by 
30 percent.

The 8th floor of Munger 

Graduate Residences — what 
Badhdadchi called the heart of 
the residence hall — is divided 
into indoor and outdoor space 
and includes a rooftop patio 
garden and large windows that 
can slide open during warmer 
months. The top floor is also 
equipped 
with 
an 
exercise 

room.

Most of the furniture has yet 

to be moved into the residence 
hall, though the project is said 
to be on schedule for completion 
in just over two weeks when 
staff residence begin arriv-
ing. The project was designed 
modularly for maximization of 
efficiency and was approved by 
the Board of Regents in Septem-
ber 2013 after the University 
received a $110 million donation 
from University alum Charles 
Munger, vice chairman of Berk-
shire Hathaway.

Ann Arbor resident sues ‘U’ to allow open carry

Lawsuit claims 

campus guns ban is 
unconstitutional

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

After igniting controversy at 

Ann Arbor’s Pioneer High School 
in March for openly carrying a gun 
to his little sister’s choir concert, 
Ann Arbor resident Joshua Wade 
advocated for the right to open 
carry again by suing the University 
for restrictions on bearing arms on 
campus.

The lawsuit, filed in June, 

claims the University’s ban of guns 
on campus to be unconstitutional.

University spokesperson Rick 

Fitzgerald said the University 
intends to file a response.

“We expect to file a response to 

the lawsuit in accordance with the 
deadline established by the Court 
of Claims,” Fitzgerald said.

Wade is not affiliated with the 

University but feels strongly about 
the University’s ban on guns. He 
has said he would like to be able to 
carry his gun on campus.

After Wade carried his gun into 

Pioneer, Ann Arbor Public Schools 
announced a ban of all guns on 
school grounds — despite the state 
law which allows citizens with 
concealed carrying licenses to 
have guns on school grounds.

Currently, the University only 

allows military and law enforce-
ment officials to carry weapons 
on campus. In September a Naval 
ROTC 
student 
carrying 
what 

appeared to be a gun was incor-
rectly reported as a possible gun-
man in the chemistry building, 
though it was “non-weaponized 
equipment.”

Article X, Section 2 of the Uni-

versity’s 
Regents’ 
Ordinances 

prohibits non-military or security 
personnel from carrying weapons 
on campus.

Fitzgerald said the reason for 

the ban is to create a safe learn-
ing environment for students and 
campus visitors.

“The University will vigorously 

defend its right to regulate weap-

ons on campus to ensure the safety 
of students, faculty, staff, patients, 
health-care providers and hun-
dreds of thousands of visitors, 
and to foster a supportive learn-
ing environment where students 
and faculty can feel free to explore 
challenging topics without fear of 
violence,” Fitzgerald said.

In an e-mail to the Daily, Phillip 

Hofmeister, president of Michigan 
Open Carry Inc., an organization 
promoting lawful open carry of a 
holstered handgun, said he sup-
ports Wade and his legal pursuit.

“We feel that places where 

guns are banned (by state statute 
or private property policy) create 
a criminal empowerment zone,” 
Hofmeister said. “These are places 

where criminals carry guns and 
can use them to harm others (as by 
their nature, criminals don’t care 
about the law or private property 
rights), but law abiding citizens 
are not given the opportunity to 
protect themselves with their own 
arms.”

Hofmeister said open carry 

privileges on campus may protect 
students from crimes such as sex-
ual assault.

“Many 
college 
and 
univer-

sity campuses have what some 
describe as an epidemic of rape,” 
Hofmeister said. “A handgun is the 
perfect tool for someone to equal-
ize the ground against their attack-
er, regardless if they are physically 
overpowered.”

City council votes down nonpartisan election proposal

Term limits, housing 

projects, and city 

primaries discussed

By ALAINA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

Voting reform and housing 

development projects were key 
issues discussed at the Ann Arbor 
City Council meeting Monday. 
Members of council voted down 
proposed resolutions on local 
official 
term-limits, 
switching 

to non-partisan elections and 
moving city primary elections. 
If passed, the resolutions would 
have gone on the November 3rd 
ballot for voters to consider.

Regarding housing develop-

ment projects within Ann Arbor, 
a number of amendments to 
the zoning chapter of city code 
passed. Many Ann Arbor resi-
dents voiced disapproval of one 
specific project, Geddes Avenue 
Improvement Project on Monday.

Among the election reform res-

olutions discussed was Council-
member Jane Lumm’s (I–Ward 2) 
proposal to put on the November 
ballot a proposal to switch elec-
tions from partisan to nonparti-
san elections — for both mayoral 
and city councilmember elections 
— which was voted against by 
Council in a 7-4 vote.

Kirk Westphal’s (D–Ward 2) 

resolution was for mayor and city 
councilmember terms to be four 
years instead of the current two-

year term system. Like Lumm, he 
also proposed a resolution to have 
non-partisan elections.

Another resolution to go on the 

ballot asked for increasing term 
numbers from two to four years 
and moving city primary elec-
tions to August and have elections 
starting in 2016 and on even years. 
This would eliminate odd-year 
elections.

None of the resolutions were 

approved to go on the November 
ballot.

Jane Lumm (I–Ward 2) said 

part of her reasoning for propos-
ing her resolution was that only 
three other counties in Michi-
gan have partisan elections and 
that Ann Arbor is an outlier. She 
said nonpartisan elections would 
encourage elected officials to go 
out and see, by going door-to-
door, what the community wants.

Voter participation was a factor 

discussed with election reform, 
and many council members dis-
cussed the problem of low voter 
turnout. Many councilmembers 
also pointed out that the signifi-
cant student population of the 
city is a large contributing factor.

Sabra Briere (D–Ward 1) said 

she has spent a lot of time looking 
for conclusive data on voter turn-
out for partisan versus nonpar-
tisan local elections. She added 
there needs to be an increase in 
student participation in city poli-
tics.

“If it wasn’t about marijuana, 

it wasn’t interesting,” Briere said 
of past student participation in 

local government. “Even when 
local races are on the same bal-
lot as state and national races, 
local races receive fewer votes — 
partisan and nonpartisan,” she 
said. “My observation has always 
been the nonpartisan ballot gets 
the least attention, has the least 
awareness and we are already 
fighting an uphill battle.”

Councilmember Sumi Kailasa-

pathy (D–Ward 1) said 5 percent 
of registered voters voted in the 
last election and that the system 
was not working to represent 
everyone in the city.

“Is it really working for the 

average voter? I don’t think so. 
Just getting more people into the 
voting booth and voting is a good 
thing,” Kailasapathy said.

Stephen Kunselman (D–Ward 

3) said the low registered voter 
turnout might be an inflated num-
ber since many students do not 
change their voter registration 
from their parents’ home address 
to the city of Ann Arbor.

Members of council ultimately 

rejected the resolution calling for 
nonpartisan elections, the motion 
calling for four-year terms and 
eliminating odd-year elections.

Council did approve, however, 

four ordinances to amend to the 
city’s zoning code. In response to 
Ann Arbor residents’ continued 
concern about the over-develop-
ment of the city, some of these 
amendments will add tighter 
restrictions on future develop-
ment plans.

One of these restrictions is the 

East Huron Character Overlay 
Amendment, proposing the maxi-
mum height be reduced for build-
ings in the D1 and D2 districts 
while adding a 130 feet maximum 
tower diagonal height.

Although the construction of 

Foundry Lofts, a student hous-
ing high-rise being built on East 
Huron that calls itself “Ann 
Arbor’s most exclusive residence,” 
will be completed this year, simi-
lar buildings as tall as the Found-
ry Lofts will not be allowed under 
the new East Huron Character 
Overlay Amendment.

During the public hearing sec-

tion about the plans for rezoning 
East Ann Street, quite a number 
of residents spoke in favor of the 
zoning revisions that they say 
would preserve the historic dis-
trict of Ann Arbor and stop more 
buildings like Foundry Lofts from 
being built there in the future.

At the public hearing for a reso-

lution to amend the re-zoning 
code in the Nixon road area area, 
three residents opposed the reso-
lution for development because of 
traffic concerns.

During 
discussion, 
council-

member Briere said the zoning 
code in downtown Ann Arbor will 
need to be continually revisited 
with care in the future and that 
building plans and their ramifica-
tions for the community need to 
be looked at not after developers 
build the structures, like in the 
case of Foundry Lofts, but before 
they are built.

Councilmember Mike Anglin 

(D–Ward 5) agreed, adding the 
rent in these areas is becoming 
too high due to these luxury high-
rises and is only getting higher.

“I think the public outcry about 

what buildings we are getting 
in terms of design are not being 
taken as significant. The public 
speak, and it’s dismissed,” said 
Anglin. “Well, that’s not good 
governance. I would like us to be 
really alert to this and not to keep 
going forward for the sake of get-
ting some more money into our 
city as if that’s going to improve 
it. Actually, what you’re going to 
do is increase expansion outside 
the city: as people can’t afford to 
be here, they’ll move out of the 
city — just the opposite effect of 
what you thought was going to 
happen.”

Councilmembers 
also 
dis-

cussed the issue of flooding with-
in the city. Because of a recent 
history of severe flooding due to 
climate change, the council is also 
looking at an ongoing creation 
of an ordinance for a floodplain 
management overlay. Members 
of council unanimously approved 
a proposal to go to the Ann Arbor 
Planning Commission for recom-
mendations for the ordinance. 
Councilmember Jack Eaton (D–
Ward 5), a sponsor of the reso-
lution along with Jane Lumm, 
worked with University gradu-
ate students to come up with the 
beginnings of the plan.

M

y dog, Moose, passed away 
last Saturday night.

He spontaneously suf-

fered from a punc-
tured 
lung, 
and 

there was nothing 
the 
veterinarian 

could reasonably do 
to save him. If he 
had 
tried, 
Moose 

would 
have 
been 

subjected to a long, 
painful recovery — if 
he made it through 
surgery. So, my dad 
and stepmom made 
the 
gut-wrenching, 

soul-aching decision to put him down. 
Since I was in Ann Arbor, I didn’t have a 
chance to say goodbye.

Despite being nearly 10-and-a-

half, Moose was a seemingly healthy 
dog. He ate well, chased passing cars 
across the yard and didn’t have a hard 
time walking up stairs.

But now, he’s gone. What gives me 

solace, though, is that Moose did not 
suffer. He didn’t have arthritis or hip 
dysplasia that would have caused a 
painful, debilitating decline. He went 
without much pain. He left us on top. 
I suppose that’s all I can really ask for.

Yet as I drive, recline on my couch 

filling out medical school applica-
tions, or sit at my desk at work, his 
memories infiltrate my thoughts.

I think about the time he barked at 

the squirrel in the tree. And the other 
time. And the other time. And the 
other time.

I think about the time he pretend-

ed to be deaf, only for us to realize 
an hour later he was just trolling the 
whole family. I crack up every time 
that gets brought up.

I think about the all the times I pet 

him, stopped, and then was immedi-
ately scratched because he wanted me 
to continue. I relented, every time.

I think about the times taking his 

130-pound frame into the pet store and 
calling him “Tiny” as other customers 
walked by. It was always hilarious.

I think about the (semi-gross?) 

times he licked my face.

I think about the times I laid with 

him on the floor, when we would look 

at each other eye to eye.

I think about the sound of his bark.
And I think about discovering what 

a Shepadoodle was nearly 11 years ago, 
telling my family this was a dog we 
had to have. He would be big, but not 
shed (though that claim turned out 
to be very, very wrong). He would be 
perfect for us.

***

It’s just so hard to believe that the 

next time I drive home, he won’t be 
outside trying to block me as I pull 
into the driveway.

The impact of a pet, especially one 

like Moose, is impossible to describe. 
It sounds a little weird to say, but 
Moose was like a brother to me. He 
was larger than life. Despite his 
imposing size, anyone who met him 
loved him, or at the very least, toler-
ated him. (My friend once texted me 
saying, “You know I hate dogs, but I 
didn’t mind Moose. That’s the best 
praise I can give a dog.” I’ll take it.)

When I came home on Sunday, our 

home felt noticeably emptier. Yes, we 
have two other dogs (shoutout to Gra-
cie and Penny), but it is clear Moose’s 
death left a glaring hole in our family. 
Throughout his whole life, he brought 
us together. He taught us what uncon-
ditional love was all about. He could 
turn any bad day into a good one. But 
because of this, I know his spirit will 
live on in me.

***

Mortality had been on my mind 

before Saturday.

Nearly two weeks ago, my grand-

father was admitted into the hospital 
after experiencing chest pains, and 
faced the prospect of needing stents or 
bypass surgery. Luckily, after under-
going a heart catheterization, neither 
was necessary. Still, I couldn’t help 
but contemplate the possibility of my 
grandfather’s life being significantly 
altered. I was afraid.

And on Friday, I finished listening 

to the audiobook of “Being Mortal,” 
the book of Dr. Atul Gawande’s mus-
ings on how death in the United States 
should be handled to reduce pain and 
suffering of the elderly at the end of 
life. Gawande discusses the need to 
have difficult conversations about

OPINION

As a separate entity under 

the state constitution, the Uni-
versity of Michigan, Michigan 
State University and Wayne 
State University have the power 
to make and enforce ordinanc-
es about weapons on campus 
that are not aligned with state 
law. However, AAPS and other 
school districts that have passed 
gun control policies, such as 
Clio Area Schools, might not 
have that right. Both districts 
are currently being sued for 
allegedly violating the Michi-
gan constitution, which allows 
for citizens with a Concealed 
Pistol License to enter gun-free 
zones as long as their concealed 
weapon is carried openly on the 
premises. The group Michigan 
Gun Owners and Ann Arbor 
resident 
and 
AAPS 
parent 

Ulysses Wong have filed a law-
suit against AAPS while Clio 
schools parent Kenneth Her-
man has filed suit against Clio. 

It seems the schools are violat-
ing the CPL and open carry laws 
surrounding in the state.

However, this is not the case 

at the University. Weapons are 
not allowed on campus unless 
specifically stated in the Stan-
dard Practice Guide. Because of 
this, there are many procedurs 
and regulations in place to make 
it easier to detect a threat on 
campus, similar to other schools 
across the state. For example, in 
September 2014, the Univer-
sity issued an Emergency Alert 
warning of a possibly armed 
suspect in the Chemistry Build-
ing. Though this turned out to 
be a false alarm, it demonstrates 
the safety benefits of gun bans 
on campus. The mere presence 
of what appeared to be a gun on 
campus set off a chain of securi-
ty procedures. Because the Uni-
versity doesn’t allow any guns 
on campus, there is no need to 
determine if a particular gun is 

a threat, and safety procedures 
can be implemented far more 
effectively. The presence of 
guns on campus can muddy the 
waters and cause uncertainty 
for students and law enforce-
ment officers alike.

Similarly, 
proponents 
of 

lifting gun bans from college 
campuses often claim that 
guns could help prevent sexual 
assaults, which would be par-
ticularly powerful considering 
recent University survey results 
show approximately 22.5 per-
cent 
of 
University 
females 

have been victims of sexual 
misconduct. 
However, 
this 

argument fails to consider the 
reality of sexual assault on col-
lege campuses; according to 
2008 research by the Nation-
al Institute of Justice, 85 to 
90 percent of sexual assaults 
against females are perpetrated 
by someone known to the vic-
tim. This invalidates the ste-

FROM THE DAILY

Take the finger off the trigger
 Michigan legislature should enact more strict gun policy
O

n March 5, Ann Arbor resident Joshua Wade openly carried his 
firearm to his younger sister’s choir concert at Pioneer High School, 
creating a disruption among audience members. In response to 

the incident, the Ann Arbor Public School Board passed three policies on 
April 15 effectively banning all weapons on school grounds unless they 
are carried by law enforcement officials. Months later, Wade, though 
unaffiliated with the University, has once again decided to take a stance on 
the right to carry his weapon and filed a lawsuit against the University for 
banning guns on campus, claiming the ban is unconstitutional. While the 
University’s ban is seemingly legal, bans enacted by other public entities, 
such as elementary and secondary schools, may not be. With the number 
of incidents involving guns on the rise, Michigan legislators must act now 

to unequivocally keep guns out of schools.

DEREK

reotypical idea of “a predator lurking 
behind the bushes” that dominates 
the conversation about sexual assault 
and suggests that guns are not the 
best antidote; when the victim trusts 
the assailant, guns are difficult to 
anticipate and implement for protec-
tion. Simply, there is no logical reason 
for guns to be on campus.

Just as college campuses should 

be gun-free zones for the safety and 
security of students, so should other 
public schools. Gov. Rick Snyder and 
the state legislature must take action 
in order to close the loopholes that 
currently allow those with a CPL to 
open carry in schools. These weapons 
are neither needed, nor wanted.


A

rt is a simultaneously 
freeing 
and 
terrifying 

thing — especially if you’re 

someone who 
chooses to pri-
marily draw in 
ink. Whenever 
I 
draw, 
I’m 

forced to relin-
quish the hesi-
tant part of 
myself. 
Each 

pen 
stroke, 

to 
a 
cer-

tain 
degree, 

demands 
decisiveness. 
Drawing can be methodical, and 
there are rules that govern how to 
create the subtle gradation of ink 
as you shade a drawing.

But, mistakes are inevitable.
Erasers have their purpose, 

and certain mediums are more 
forgiving than others. If the piece 
develops past a certain point, any 
error or any little slip of your pen 
becomes a permanent fixture of 
the piece. After that, you can work 
to blend it into the background, or 
you force yourself to redirect your 
piece and transform an error into 
a beneficial accident.

As a navigationally challenged 

individual as well as an artist, 
another type of redirection is also 
all too familiar. I get lost all the 
time. It honestly doesn’t matter 
whether I’ve lived in a place for 
my whole life or for only a mat-
ter of days. Whether following 
my friends’ cars on some back-
roads back home or venturing on 
an unfamiliar path in Ann Arbor, 
there’s a good chance I’ll take a 
wrong turn or find the longest, 
most complicated route possible.

My notorious lack of direction 

always leads to a few jokes and 
some concern from my friends, 
but I’ve grown to appreciate these 
moments of being lost. Only when 
it’s related to art or roaming about 
a city do I abandon my indecisive-
ness. Getting lost is rarely, if ever, 
deemed a smart thing to do, but 
it’s in these moments that making 
mistakes feels like an avenue to 
figuring things out. Those close to 
me have repeatedly noticed a par-
ticular behavior whenever I seek 
advice from them. They’ve told 
me that basically I tend to know 
exactly what I want to do, but I 
often worry if the decision I’m 
making is a smart one.

It’s not unusual to want to avoid 

making mistakes. However, far 
too often I’ve fallen under a com-

mon 
misconception 
described 

by Prof. Jo Boaler of Stanford 
University. I’ve often mistakenly 
associated both “being smart” 
and making smart decisions with 
never getting anything wrong. In 
my mind, there’s always been an 
absolutely “right” decision.

This type of thinking develops 

at a very young age and continues 
throughout one’s life. Accord-
ing to Boaler, this misconcep-
tion originates when individuals 
“perform well (academically or 
otherwise) at young ages and are 
labeled smart or gifted,” and as a 
result, “they become less likely to 
challenge themselves.” Fearful of 
making mistakes, these students 
may surround themselves in their 
comfort zones.

College is meant to be an 

environment that steeps us in 
academia to challenge our ways 
of thinking and reasoning, to 
expand our skill sets and to gain 
knowledge. Essentially, the goal 
of these insti-
tutions is to 
make 
young 

adults smart-
er. 
We’re 

aware of this 
purpose when 
we apply. Here 
at the Univer-
sity, 
intelli-

gence is one of 
the tenets we 
pride ourselves on. However, few 
may consider how college should 
change our definitions of intel-
ligence and challenge our own 
perceptions of how smart we con-
sider ourselves to be.

The opportunities to redefine 

these notions, challenge ourselves 
and to make mistakes continu-
ally evolve throughout our college 
careers. In the early undergradu-
ate years, anxiety may arise as 
one deliberates between diffi-
cult courses or between different 
requirements when selecting a 
major. Eventually, we may begin 
to hesitate and deliberate as con-
cerns may shift to what organiza-
tions to join or what jobs to apply 
to. (As a rising senior, the last one 
is growing increasingly relevant 
and nerve-wracking.)

There’s always pressure to 

accomplish 
this 
intelligently 

and with the least amount of 
error possible — possibly to the 
point where students inhibit 
themselves if any of the options 
threaten this plan. Yet, numer-
ous factors are at play and could 

pose a risk. If a student, for one 
reason or another, doesn’t under-
stand a concept, fails an exam, 
does poorly in a class, switches 
their major, decides to transfer 
to a different university, partici-
pates in a job or internship that 
doesn’t really suit their interests, 
misses a deadline or applies for a 
job they don’t get, there’s merit 
to each one of these occurrences.

These incidents of being lost 

don’t indicate a lack of intel-
ligence. Rather, they provide 
opportunities 
for 
individuals 

to demonstrate the knowledge 
they’ve gained as they redirect 
their ambitions, create new plans 
and move forward. As daunting as 
the possibility of mistakes may be, 
they’re crucial aspects of learn-
ing. Boaler elaborates on this by 
describing how embracing chal-
lenges and even potential failure 
stimulates cognitive structures 
responsible for brain growth.

This 
style 
of 
learning 
— 

referred to as a 
growth mindset 
by psychologist 
Carol Dweck — 
through 
facing 

challenges 
and 

making 
errors 

even 
possesses 

the potential to 
upheave issues of 
gender inequal-
ity 
in 
society. 

Dismantling the idea that intelli-
gence is innate could drive more 
young women to enroll in chal-
lenging STEM classes. Without 
the fear of failure or mistakes, 
women may apply for more lucra-
tive positions in other underrep-
resented career sectors or may 
choose to further their education 
at the postgraduate level.

Risk prevention is beneficial 

only to a certain extent, and 
intelligence doesn’t translate into 
the absence of mistakes in one’s 
life. Instead, a mark of being 
truly smart is acknowledging the 
necessity of testing one’s limits, 
accepting the possibility of fail-
ure and appreciating the value of 
being lost. You may wander and 
turn down the wrong path with 
no way to erase your steps. You, 
actually, may make numerous 
wrong turns. But, the skills and 
the knowledge you uncover along 
the way will aid you in creating a 
new path.

each other, “How much pain and

But those thoughts were born

experienced actual loss with actual 
grief with actual sadness.

I know this column has a lot

From theater to threads: 
alum Jonathan Parkey

FASHION FEATURE

University theater 

alum finds his footing 
in the fashion world

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Summer Senior Arts Editor

Most collegiate thespians set 

their sights on New York City after 
four years of classes, rehearsals 
and high-energy performances. 
And that’s just where Jonathan 
Parkey ended up after his SMDT 
undergraduate career, but rather 
than the Garden Theater, Par-
key found himself in a different 
Broadway bastion — fashion label 
Proenza Schouler’s showroom.

After graduating from the 

University in 2009, Parkey took 
the customary course of incipi-
ent actors — taking odd jobs 
to make ends meet in the city. 
Along with juggling auditions, 
shows and stints in children’s 
theater tours, he was a part-time 
personal assistant and waiter at 
Hillstone Restaurant. 

But his initial foray into fash-

ion 
occurred 
serendipitously, 

over dinner with an ex-coworker 
from the restaurant. Eight months 
prior, she had traded the wait-
ressing life to be the studio man-
ager at Proenza Schouler. She 
had recently been promoted and 
offered Parkey her old position at 
the womenswear brand.

“I was definitely hesitant to 

begin,” Parkey said. “The nice part 
about being an actor is you can 
always pick back up where you left 
off. That’s what I told myself when 
I started at Proenza — if I hate it in 
six months, I can go back to audi-
tioning, no harm done.’”

Parkey assumed the studio 

manager position while also serv-
ing as executive assistant to the 
CEO. He was almost immediately 
recognized for his auspicious 
work ethic.

“My boss quickly was like 

‘you’re really smart; you’re really 
talented; you just have to stick it 
out in this role for a year and then 
we’re going to find your way into 
the company,’ ” Parkey said.

The CEO was true to her 

word, and as Parkey spent the 
year taking on extra hours run-

ning the studio, making what he 
considered pennies, he eventu-
ally rose up in the company and 
became a collection coordina-
tor — his first experience on the 
wholesale account.

“With that I was sort of a brand 

ambassador to speak with clients,” 
he said. “I would bring in new 
samples for stores and say ‘here’s 
all of the collection your buyers 
bought for you, this is how you 
wear it, this is how you style it, 
this is what’s exciting about it.’ ”

Shortly after, when Proenza 

was opening their flagship New 
York store, Parkey was promoted 
to be retail operations manager. 
Last April, he bid a fond farewell 
to the company that gave him 
his fashion footing as he tran-
sitioned back into wholesale for 
Thom Browne. 

“When I told the CEO I was 

leaving for Thom Browne, I think 
she said it best when she said ‘It’s 
sort of like you’re graduating from 
high school,’ ” Parkey said. “Each 
office and working atmosphere is 
very different. I think that was 
the biggest shift for me, start-
ing fresh at a company where the 
familial atmosphere was some-

what missing.”

Parkey spent a mere eight 

months at Thom Browne, serving 
as the women’s wholesale man-
ager along with running women’s 
international wholesale distribu-
tion. During his short time with 
the brand, the Proenza CEO 
introduced him to Rosetta Getty, 
the LA-based socialite with a 
then-emerging fashion label. She 
offered him the position of wom-
en’s wholesale director, an offer 
he said he couldn’t refuse. The 
first Rosetta Getty collection he 
worked with was pre-fall 2015, 
which showed in December of 
last year. 

“Rosetta is one of the cool-

est people and bosses,” he said. 
“She provides a very LA energy 
to the team. She’s very laid back, 
very cerebral, super smart and 
one of the chicest people on the 
planet.”

Though the label has Califor-

nia roots, Parkey works from 
New York. He frequently trav-
els to Paris for work and consid-
ers it a home away from home. 
Along with the jetsetting life, 
Parkey loves being apart of the 
small, close-knit luxury fashion 
community. As far as his future 
plans go, nothing is for certain.

“I think the next part for me 

may be going back and getting 
my MBA, maybe going back 
and preparing myself for a little 
more high level executive posi-
tion,” he said.

Should Parkey return to the 

classroom, he’ll surely set the 
style curve.

‘Amy,’ exposed 

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Summer Managing Arts Editor

We knew Amy Winehouse, musi-

cal artist; we knew Amy Winehouse, 
tabloid fixation; now, we have the 
immense pleasure 
of knowing Amy 
Winehouse 
— 

incredibly talented, 
incredibly troubled 
young woman.

“Amy” 
offers 

an unfettered look 
into 
the 
newest 

member of the “27 
Club.” It features 
footage of Wine-
house’s 
private 

life and interviews of friends, fam-
ily and coworkers interspersed 
with extraordinary musical mon-
tages in which Winehouse’s lyrics 
float across the screen — visually 
achieving the hauntedness which 
always saturated her sound. “Amy” 
achieves the single aspect that can 
make or break a documentary: bal-
ance. Director Asif Kapadia master-
fully balances Winehouse’s life: the 
public, the private, the professional 
and the personal.

Beneath the facade of addic-

tion, Winehouse was sweet. She 
ducks behind a pillow as her friend 
attempts to record her in the back 
seat of a car. Despite her seem-
ingly careless demeanor at perfor-
mances (during some of which she 
was booed off the stage), she cared 
— maybe too much — about her 
musical craft. She frustrates her-
self during a recording session with 
Tony Bennett, revealing her true 
youth and insecurity. These touch-
ing moments reveal the real Amy.

Possibly even more important 

than the subject herself, the film 
moves viewers into seeing the tox-
icity of modern society through the 
experience of “Amy.” It subtly criti-
cizes. It showcases how it became 
OK to joke about her eating disor-

ders and drug addiction. One of the 
most poignant moments occurs 
at the 2005 Grammy Nomination 
announcements 
where 
George 

Lopez announces Amy’s nomina-
tion for Record of the Year, after 
which he tells the audience to wake 
her up to let her know. 

Furthermore, it subtly touches 

on greed. The objectivity of the film 
upset Winehouse’s father, Mitch, 
as he believes he was painted to 
be a villain. However, “painted” is 
not fitting. “Woven” expresses the 
manner in which a viewer’s feelings 
toward Mitch Winehouse prog-
ress. The lyric “I ain’t got the time 
/ and if my daddy thinks I’m fine” 
fails to hold any of the lightness the 
chord progressions once presented. 
Now, after two hours of witness-
ing Winehouse’s struggle and four 
years after her death, it’s hard not 
to ask the obvious question: Why 
did you think she was fine? Maybe it 
was pride. Maybe he truly believed 
she was “fine.” Maybe his book deal, 
television show and constant push 
for a never-to-be third album tell a 
different story.

Ultimately, “Amy” is heart-

breaking. Despite containing a 
plethora of chill-inducing and 
heart-wrenching moments, one 
scene manages to encapsulate the 
film. Amy Winehouse has just won 
Best New Artist and she accepts 
her award from the UK (she failed 
a drug test, thus rejecting her visa 
application to attend the awards). 
Immediately after Tony Bennett 
announces her name, she looks up 
in awe — a moment so beautiful and 
pure it sends chills up your spine. 
Then, a friend recounts Amy stat-
ing later that night, “This isn’t fun 
without drugs.”

“Amy” isn’t an easy watch by any 

means, but it is certainly reward-
ing. In my mind, a documentary is 
meant to expose what hasn’t been 
known. I now know Amy Wine-
house … and miss her dearly.

I turn to the man to my right and 

ask, “So where are you camping?” 
He and the other journalists and 
photographers at the table start 
laughing. 

“We don’t camp out there,” 

said the woman next to him in a 
hot pink skort and cowboy boots. 
I realize I am the only one burnt 
and unshowered. 

I’m in the media tent behind the 

main stage of Faster Horses — one 
of the largest 3-day country music 
festivals in the country. Staff keeps 
asking to double check my creden-
tials. Each time I show them my 
media and photo wristbands their 
eyebrows raise in disbelief. I have 
“random crazed fan-girl trying to 
sneak backstage” written all over 
me. The room is filled with middle-
aged men in T-shirts and cargo 
shorts, wielding very big camera 
lenses. My Canon Rebel T3i is the 
laughing stock and I know it. I 
don’t try to pretend to be a profes-
sional photographer, or a profes-
sional journalist for that matter 
— instead I weave between the 
realms of media and fans, observ-
ing yet never belonging to either. 

“Alright, 
photographers 
line 

up,” said astaffer who looks like a 
drill sergeant at the entry to the 
main stage. 

I look around and follow the 

much bigger cameras into a line.

“You know the drill,” Staff Ser-

geant announces. “Stay around 
the front of the stage, and return 
to the media tent after the first 
three songs.” 

And then we start to walk. We 

walk out into a cheering crowd, 
into the space in between the front 
row and the stage. The drunk and 
crazed fans stretch their hands out 
to me, high five me, pose for me. 

I look around and realize the 

other photographers are position-
ing themselves, prepping, taking 
test shots. Then, the interim music 
ends, lights come on, and Frankie 
Ballard begins. 

Before this festival the extent 

of my country knowledge was an 
occasional Zach Brown Band at a 
darty, that song about fried chick-
en, and all the other songs about 
getting even with a cheating ex in 
a trucks with a gun. I didn’t under-
stand it and I didn’t really want 
to. The night before I left for the 
weekend I went through and lis-
tened to at least a few songs from 

every artist that was on the line-
up and made brief notes. My note 
for Frankie Ballard reads, “Album 
2014 called <em>Sunshine and 
Whiskey</em>, also popular song 
title, lyric: ‘Every time you kiss me 
it’s like sunshine and whisky’ it’s 
about a girl and a beach and want-
ing to hookup with her with gun 
allusions.” So why am I so giddy 
right now? I didn’t even know who 
he was 48-hours ago. 

From a pure performance stand 

point he shocked me. He is spec-
tacular. He interacts with the audi-
ence just enough so you feel like 
he really cares, but not so much 
that you feel like he is trying too 
hard. He rips off his jean jacket 
and throws it in the heat of the 
moment, only to politely ask for it 
back because; it is in fact his favor-
ite jacket. He promises the lucky 
recipient something else. 

Three songs end in the blink of 

an eye and we are escorted back 
to the tent. The other photogra-
phers make similar comments on 
his animated performance. Every-
one sits down and starts looking at 
their photos, checking their email, 
scrolling through their assorted 
screens. I get confused. The show 
is still going on, things are hap-
pening, and they sure as hell aren’t 
happening inside this tent. 

I leave the tent, the media, the 

stage and wander back to the camp 
inside the speedway race tracks — 
where the real story is.

This 
camp, 
referred 
to 
as 

“infield,” houses a large portion of 
the 40,000 attendees to the fes-
tival. Trailers, trucks and tents 
line endlessly inside a fenced-in 
track — creating a dystopian alter-
nate universe. Men wearing horse 
heads patrol the grounds in the 
back of pick-up trucks. You know 
the movie Mad Max where people 
revert to tribal behavior while 
driving trucks in a barren waste-
land where oil is currency? Well 
it’s like that except the currency is 
ice. Because it is so challenging to 
get out of camp and return, all meat 
and produce is kept fresh in cool-
ers that are refilled with ice daily. 
Because the small convenient shop 
in the center of camp knows they 
have a monopoly, ice is ten dollars 
a bag. The food and water is simi-
larly priced. Rumors heard in the 
bathrooms suggest that discounts 
are given to women who flash their 
breasts. Discounts. Women aren’t 
even getting free ice for exposing 
their bodies. The horror. 

A few girls in my camp encoun-

ter a notorious man in the infield 
whose wife had gotten significant 
breast implants and sits with just 
duct tape over her nipples. The man 
announces that he “paid $40,000 
for those tits” and then encourages 
girls or certain men to touch them. 

During my stay in the infield I 

realize that the festival does not 
center around the stage, but rather 
on the camp. People spend days 
without even going into the festi-
val, trailers and converted buses 
host parties at all hours, and it is 
rare for anyone to leave for the fes-
tival until close to dusk. 

After the headliners on the 

main stage end around midnight, 
everyone rushes back to the 
infield. The open area surround-
ing the bathrooms in the cen-
ter of camp become a gathering 
spot. Next to the bathroom are 
two large tents with a homemade 
stripper pole with a fluorescent 
sign reading “Cameltoe Bar.” It is 
unclear whether it was an estab-
lishment receiving money for the 
alcohol provided, or if it is just a 
very friendly man pouring mys-
tery juice into peoples cups. Two 
rows down to the right is a bit 
quieter, less rowdy “bar” called 
Pilgrim. It is a wooden bar next to 
a converted trolly of some kind, 
with a tent covering it and tables 
in front of it for drinking games. 
The alcohol is poured out of plas-
tic bins — payment also unclear. 
But the real hot spot of the infield 
is on the main road leading to 
the entrance to camp. It is a dou-
ble decker red bus revamped to 
allow for maximum capacity with 
speakers on either end. Music 
blasted day in and day out. (I lost 
my lens cap there one night and, 
when I returned in the morning 
to a middle aged woman sweep-
ing layers of cans, she very kindly 
found and returned it to me.)

A storm came and broke our 

tents and scattered our food. Trash 
littered the yard. I strained my 
Achilles and sought help from the 
single medical tent in the infield 
where I was treated with a wrap 
and Benadryl by a one-eyed-
doctor. I began verbally sexually 
harassing men as they walked by 
me in an ill-thought-out attempt 
to retaliate against the constant 
chirping. Extreme things happen 
in extreme places. But amid the 
chaos was an indescribable cama-
raderie. Between the artists and 
their fans, between strangers who 

happen to stand next to each other 
in line, between neighboring camp 
sites. Within this microcosm the 
people you knew for a day felt like 
old friends. The world may be a 
constructed absurdity, but the rela-
tionships built felt authentic. 

I came to realize that it is this 

idea of authenticity that lies at 
the core of country music. On the 
first day I skeptically asked my 
campmates what was so great 
about country. One said, “It’s the 
only thing that is easy to relate to. 
They don’t hide behind metaphors. 
There are good stories and they are 

real. They are honest.” That was 
the point of it all. I didn’t find this 
raw, unedited, dirty, exciting truth 
inside the media tent. I found it in

Study finds medical marijuana users more addicted
High school students 
less likely to become 
hooked on illicit weed

By ALANA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

According to a recent Univer-

sity study, if you use medical mari-
juana and you’re a high school 
student, you are more likely to 
become addicted to the substance 
than from the use of non-medical 
marijuana.

The authors of the study used 

data from another study, Monitor-
ing the Future, an ongoing look at 

drug use among American adoles-
cents.

The study, “Adolescents’ Use of 

Medical Marijuana: A Secondary 
Analysis of Monitoring the Future 
Data,” divided 12th grade adoles-
cents in the data into four groups. 
These four groups were non-mari-
juana users, users who had medi-
cal marijuana papers, users who 
used someone else’s marijuana 
without medical papers, and users 
who obtained marijuana from an 
illicit source — i.e. non-medical 
marijuana.

The study was done in order to 

determine how much the three 
groups smoked when compared 

with each other. The authors of 
the study also wanted to look at 
which of the three marijuana-
using groups tended to use or not 
use other substances.

According to the study, few 

teens 
actually 
get 
marijuana 

directly or illegally from medical 
sources. The vast majority of 12th 
grade marijuana users get the sub-
stance from non-medical, illegal 
sources.

The study found the group of 

non-medical marijuana users were 
the least likely to engage in risky 
behaviors — defined as engaging 
the activities of using the sub-
stance on “40 or more occasions,” 

smoking weed every day, or being 
drunk and using other illegal or 
legal substances — of the three 
marijuana-using groups.

The study also analyzed those 

who said they were addicted to 
marijuana. Carol Boyd, a Universi-
ty professor in the School of Nurs-
ing and one of the authors of the 
study, said the group of medical-
card carrying marijuana users and 
the group of users who obtained 
medical marijuana from someone 
else were both likelier to say they 
were “hooked” than those who 
used illegal marijuana.

“Medical 
users 
were 
10.2-

fold more likely to say they were 

hooked when compared to teens 
who used illicit marijuana,” Boyd 
said. “Diverted medical users were 
6.4- fold more likely to say they 
were hooked when compared to 
teens who used illicit marijuana. 
These increased odds were statis-
tically significant for both groups.”

In the discussion section of 

the study, authors noted some 
research setbacks, one of which 
was that the data only included 
12th grade students who were 
enrolled in school, leaving out 
those unenrolled. 

For deeper understanding, the 

study says more research should 
be done on the topic.

“What is really promising is 

that many...are fierce competi-
tors working side by side to figure 
out this mobility challenge for the 
future,” Steudle said. “At the end of 
the day, there’s still 33,000 Ameri-
cans–motorists–that lost their lives 
last year on highways. The future 
of automated/connected vehicles 
holds the promise to drive those 
numbers down significantly…This 
is the facility that’s gonna help us 
get there.”

In her speech to attendees, con-

gresswoman Debbie Dingell (MI–
12) said connected and autonomous 
vehicles could eliminate 80 percent 
of crash related deaths, according 
to the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Board.

In addition to Mcity’s impact 

on advancements in driver safety, 
Dingell also spoke of the facility’s 
clear benefits to Michigan’s auto 
industry and economy.

In an interview with the Daily, 

Dingell, former president and exec-
utive director of Community Rela-
tions and Government Relations of 
GM, said the research and partner-
ships formed through Mcity will 
keep the latest automotive technol-
ogy within Michigan’s borders.

“Transportation’s always been 

the backbone of Michigan’s econ-
omy, and we don’t want to see the 
cutting edge technology go to any 
other state,” Dingell said. “This is 
what happens when you bring Uni-
versity, business, government, aca-
demia– all together, and you work 
together– you stay at the cutting 
edge.”

In an interview with the Daily, 

senator Gary Peters (D.–Mich.) said 
Michigan’s brand new facility will 
attract top notch transportation 
innovators from all over the U.S.

“Having this track at the Univer-

sity of Michigan– having University 
of Michigan’s leadership– will act 
as a beacon to bring researchers 
from around the country to Michi-
gan to do their work.”

In his address to the audience, 

Peters said Mcity would maintain 
the center of transportation tech-
nology in Michigan, rather than in 
California.

“We are not gonna let Silicon 

Valley take this technology because 
this technology is born at the Uni-
versity of Michigan– born in the 
greater Detroit area, and we’re 
gonna be the global leader of this 
technology that will transform 
mobility,” Peters said.

Peters said he’s been supporting 

Michigan’s transportation research 
in Congress by introducing legis-
lation in the Transportation Bill 
that aims to allow Michigan to 
use federal money for transporta-
tion research, including funding 
for sensors that are crucial to the 
infrastructure technology associ-
ated with automated vehicles. For 
instance, with the development 
of new technology, innovators are 
designing sensors that alert auto-
mated cars of approaching dangers, 
such as a bridge that is icing over.

Senator Debbie Stabenow (D–

Mich.) addressed the fact that, 
although many may find it diffi-
cult to envision a world in which 
cars completely drive themselves, 
Michigan innovators and industry 
experts would show us through 
findings at Mcity that automated 
vehicles have the potential to be 

safer, more efficient and therefore 
more popular than the current 
technology.

She equated the concept of self-

driving cars in the present to Henry 
Ford’s revolutionary idea of replac-
ing horse transportation with auto-
mobiles at the beginning of the 20th 
century.

“At the last century, when Henry 

Ford was first talking about the 
automobile, the horseless carriage, 
and everybody said he was crazy– 
that nothing would replace the 
horse. We’ve been riding horses 
since the dawn of civilization, and 
so nothing was gonna change– 
except the horse,” Stabenow said.

“So this century we’re used to 

driving cars, so it’s very hard to 
imagine that cars will drive us as 
the next innovation.”

Ann Arbor’s Mayor Christopher 

Taylor also spoke to attendees of 
Mcity’s positive impact on the city.

“The Mobility Transportation 

Center Projects– they will play an 
important and critical role in assist-
ing communities like Ann Arbor 
to come up with new solutions for 
congestion, and, most importantly, 
these projects will ensure that our 
community integrates cars, bus-
ses, pedestrians and bicycles into a 
seamless, safe and effective trans-
portation network, and we couldn’t 
be more excited,” Taylor said.

After government officials and 

University administrators formally 
spoke, attendees watched vari-
ous demonstrations of collabora-
tive projects on the Mcity test site. 
One such demonstration was the 
Bosch automatic emergency brak-
ing for pedestrians demonstration, 
in which a radar sensor located 
on the test vehicle recognized an 
approaching cyclist, automatically 

slowing the vehicle to a stop to pre-
vent a collision.

Greg Stevens, Ford’s global man-

ager of automated driving projects, 
represents Ford within the Uni-
versity’s Mobility Transformation 
Center. He said the launch of Mcity 
would greatly benefit Ford because, 
while the company owns and oper-
ates test tracks for improving speed 
and other vehicle features, it does 
not have its own mock city.

“We guide what research top-

ics MTC does, so we contribute 
our experience to say these are the 
types of challenges we would like 
MTC to take on and research, and 
we also benefit from being able to 
use all this infrastructure around,” 
Stevens said.

Stevens added Mcity will help 

Ford develop, in partnership with 
the University, specific technology 
they are currently working on to 
prevent collisions at blind intersec-
tions by equipping cars with mes-
saging systems to automatically 

alert nearby vehicles of their loca-
tion.

Ryan Eustice, an associate pro-

fessor of engineering at the Uni-
versity who has been collaborating 
with Ford, testing automated vehi-
cles, said Mcity is uniquely ben-
eficial to transportation research 
because it allows researchers to 
simulate possible collisions and 
dangerous situations on demand.

Eustice said that, although the 

state of Michigan allows engineers 
to test certain cars on public roads, 
the out-of-the-ordinary accidents 
that automated cars need to learn 
how to detect are fairly rare and 
therefore difficult to gather data 
from.

“We get to be maximally evil 

here to the cars, so we get to cre-
ate a very high density of just weird 
corner cases that you need to deal 
with,” Eustice said.

Soccer getting ready 
for upcoming season

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s soccer team 

reunites in Ann Arbor this week 
ahead of the upcoming season. The 
Wolverines begin captains’ prac-
tices July 28, a full 20 days before 
the opening exhibition against 
Butler in Ann Arbor.

The two captains, fifth-year mid-

fielder Colin McAtee and senior 
forward James Murphy, will lead 
these training sessions as a means 
for the team to get back into rhythm 
before the preseason exhibitions. 
The incoming freshmen will begin 
to move into players’ houses, where 
they’ll reside before moving into the 
residence halls.

The team has only made a few 

changes to the roster over the 
course of the offseason. Three 
important seniors, midfielder Tyler 
Arnone, goalkeeper Adam Grinwis 
and Marcos Ugarte all moved on 
to minor league teams. Former 
freshman Ahinga Selemani trans-
ferred to UC Santa Barbara, where 
he joined one of the nation’s top 

recruiting classes. Selemani was 
the Wolverines’ starting center for-
ward, but an unexceptional debut 
season left Selemani with little rea-
son to stay.

While Grinwis was a strong 

keeper, 
sophomore 
goalkeeper 

Evan Louro earned many minutes 
last year as a highly-touted fresh-
man, and will certainly be ready 
to step in as the team’s number one 
shot stopper.

A strong, eight-person incom-

ing class that includes two inter-
nationals from Ghana and Chile 
is expected to make an immediate 
impact and fill any gaps.

Michigan’s 
first 
exhibition 

against the Bulldogs is followed 
12 days later by the first preseason 
game in Omaha, Nebraska, against 
a Creighton team that finished the 
season ranked in the top 10.

Winning games against reputable 

non-Big Ten schools is crucial for 
Michigan, a team in its 16th season 
that has still yet to achieve consis-
tent success. Despite one trip to the 
NCAA Tournament College Cup, 
soccer’s equivalent of the Final Four, 

the 
Wolver-

ines have only 
made a scat-
tered number 
of tournament 
appearances, 
the last in 2012, 
and have yet to 
win a Big Ten 
regular season 
title.

As someone 

who has now 
had time away from Michigan, for-
mer captain Arnone is beginning 
to see how the Wolverines stack up 
on the national grid, playing for the 
Real Monarchs of the United Soc-
cer League.

“In the professional ranks, peo-

ple ask, ‘Where’d you go to school?’ 
They know the name Michigan, but 
in terms of soccer, it’s not as much 
respected,” Arnone said. “(Michi-
gan) is not UNC or UCLA. Those 
are the big schools. Is (Daley) the 
guy to bring Michigan to that level? 
That’s the question for me.”

Arnone, part of previous coach 

Steve Burns’ last recruiting class, 

felt that the 2014 was hyped to be 
“the season” that would bringing 
Michigan up to the next level, but 
the team was radically inconsis-
tent, losing to teams it was predict-
ed to dominate.

“Last season, we were, on paper, 

one of the best teams in the coun-
try, and surely one of the best in our 
conference,” said senior forward 
Will Mellors-Blair. “We thought 
we could just show up on a Tues-
day night and mull over teams like 
Bowling Green and Western Mich-
igan, and that’s got to change.”

While Michigan is often con-

sidered a favorite in many of those 

matchups against less nationally-
renowned programs, it has yet to 
truly earn its place in the cham-
pionship conversation among the 
likes of the Tar Heels and Bruins.

“We have all the infrastructure 

we need, it’s just a matter of having 
that one season which will define 
Michigan soccer on the national 
track,” Mellors-Blair said.

The Wolverines need more time 

than just one season to become a 
definitive, consistent contender on 
the national level, but they’ll need 
to start somewhere.

And the 2015 season is just 

around the bend.

Nike, Michigan ink 
$169 million deal

The agreement 

creates the largest 
college apparel deal 

in the country

By ZACH SHAW 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

One week after announcing 

that it had agreed to a record-high 
apparel deal with Nike, the Michi-
gan Athletic Department released 
details this morning about the 
overwhelmingly popular contract.

The highlight of the agreement 

is that Michigan will receive $169 
million over the duration of the 
15-year contract, 
including $76.8 
million in cash 
alone, $12 mil-
lion in upfront 
money and $80.2 
million in appar-
el.

The 
deal 

blows past the 
10-year, 
$90 

million contract 
Notre 
Dame 

signed with Under Armour ear-
lier this year as the largest in the 
country. But with Adidas, Under 
Armour and Nike all offering simi-
lar amounts of money, cash was 
only one step of the five-month 
process that saw Nike emerge as 
the obvious choice.

“This decision, this partner-

ship is about more than Michigan 
athletics,” said Interim Athletic 
Director Jim Hackett. “At the core, 
it is about our University com-
munity and it is 
about two great 
names reuniting 
for an opportu-
nity that speaks 
to 
more 
than 

uniforms 
and 

apparel.”

Michigan 

football, 
men’s 

basketball 
and 

women’s 
bas-

ketball were listed as the three 
flagship sports in the deal, while 
baseball, hockey and softball will 
continue to have equipment pro-
vided from third parties. In total 
11 sports will continue to use their 
current equipment providers, so 
long as that provider isn’t Adidas, 

Under Armour, Reebok or Puma.

Also included in the deal are 

plans to expand the partnership 
beyond apparel. The initial agree-
ment includes an obligation for 
Nike to hire at least three summer 
interns from the University each 
year at $15,000 per student, and 
two community events to be host-
ed in Ann Arbor each year.

According to the Term Sheet, 

Michigan and Nike also have 
a “shared interest and goal of 
improving working conditions in 
the subcontracted factories used 
to make (Nike) product.” This 
clause is largely in response to 
community outcry in the past over 
Nike’s reputation for low-wage 

sweatshops.

Mentioned 

in another seg-
ment of the Term 
Sheet 
released 

Wednesday are 
tentative 
but 

unspecified 
plans for Michi-
gan 
and 
Nike 

to 
collaborate 

in 
“furthering 

research 
and 

innovation in regards to sport 
performance and (environmen-
tal) sustainability.” Language was 
included in the contract to include 
Michigan’s Recreational Sports 
Department in such collaborations.

“The University of Michigan 

ranks high among the world’s great 
institutions of higher learning and 
enjoys a rich, tradition-laden histo-
ry in college sports,” said Joaquin 
Hidalgo, Vice President and Gen-
eral Manager, Nike North America 

in 
last 
week’s 

announcement. 
“We 
eagerly 

look 
forward 

to bringing out 
the best in each 
other.”

In 
addition 

to 
shattering 

the record for 
the largest deal 
in NCAA his-

tory, Michigan will also receive 
15-percent royalty rates on appar-
el purchases. This exceeds the 
10-percent 
Michigan 
currently 

receives in its deal with Adidas, 
passes Notre Dame’s 13-percent 
and is believed to be the highest in 
the country.

“It is about two 

great names 

reuniting for an 

opporunity.”

Michigan will 

also receive 
15-percent 

royalty rates.

Student tickets up 54 percent

By ZACH SHAW 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Less than a day after reveal-

ing it had sealed the largest 
apparel deal in college sports 
history, the Michigan Athletic 
Department revealed more good 
news for the program Thursday.

After a 2014 season marred 

by national embarrassments, 
student protests, a resigning 
Athletic Director and a losing 
season, Michigan announced 
that it has ended season ticket 
sales for the 2015 season at 
89,795, the highest total since 
2012.

After selling just 11,597 stu-

dent tickets last season — its 
lowest total in decades — Michi-
gan has announced a 54-percent 
sales increase, capping student 
ticket sales at 17,899.

With home games against 

both Michigan State and Ohio 
State and the hotly-anticipated 

debut of Michigan coach and 
former star quarterback Jim 
Harbaugh, it’s no surprise that 
ticket sales are up. But after giv-
ing away nearly 63,000 tickets 
in seven home games last season 
— including 16,923 in the team’s 
home finale against Maryland — 
to keep the program’s 100,000-
fan attendance streak alive, the 
increase in sales is a welcome 
sign for Michigan nonetheless.

The sales increase is most 

notable in the student section, 
where sales have fluctuated 
from record lows to the high-
est total since 2012. There are 
many factors to such a rise, but 
price stands as the most notable 
change.

After charging students $295 

for tickets the previous two 
seasons, the standard season 
ticket price for football fell to 
$175. In addition to the nearly 
40-percent discount, the Ath-
letic Department announced in 

February that need-based stu-
dent tickets would be available 
for $100.

All three price points are 

lower than that of men’s bas-
ketball season tickets, which 
remained the same at $200 and 
offered $120 need-based tickets. 
Per-game prices, however, are 
still highest in football at $25 
per game.

Student 
seating 
will 
be 

assigned based on attendance at 
the 2014 season’s games, with 
the policy rewarding better seats 
in 2015 to students who attended 
at least six games last fall and 
arrived more than 20 minutes 
before kickoff. The policy change 
comes after a shift to a general 
admission model prior to the 
2013 season, which was met with 
uproar by the student body.

Non-student 
sales 
also 

increased to 72,076, the most sold 
since before renovations began in 
2009.

Northern 
coasts, 

where on Friday morning he 
visited the famous Omaha Beach 
battleground in Normandy and 
chatted about life with 1957 Ohio 
State captain Leo Brown.

Chances 
are 
you 
already 

knew that, though — and not 
necessarily 
because 
you’re 

stalking the Michigan coach.

Using social 

media, a goofy 
demeanor and 
a 
growing 

national 
presence, 
Harbaugh 
has 
turned 

his 
summer 

into a pseudo-
reality 
show 

that demands a 
following.

You can call it a manufactured 

plan to wake up a long-dormant 
program, or simply a weirdo 
coach craving attention.

Either way, it’s working.

He can be in Peru on a mission 

trip, struggling with a five-minute 
radio interview over the phone 
or even debating the definition 
of irony from his armchair, but 
you can bet he will be a national 
talking point.

According to 

the 
analytics 

website 
Topsy, 

the 
name 

“Harbaugh” has 
been mentioned 
over 
45,000 

times on Twitter 
in the past 30 
days — an average of more than 
1,500 tweets about him per day. 
Seven weeks ago, his shirtless 
rampage 
in 
Alabama 
was 

America’s No. 1 trend on Twitter.

Do you remember the last time 

Brady Hoke trended nationally — 
other than being fired — or where 

Lloyd Carr went 
on vacation in 
the offseason? I 
doubt it.

Even 
other 

high-profile 
coaches 
can’t 
escape 

Harbaugh’s 
summer. 
The 

first 
question 

asked 
at 
SEC 

Media 
Day 

earlier this week was related 
to 
Jim 
Harbaugh’s 
satellite 

camps. Local coaches such as 
Ohio State’s Urban Meyer and 
Michigan State’s Mark Dantonio 

repeatedly 
field 
Harbaugh 

questions at their own press 
conferences, 
much 
to 
their 

politically-correct chagrin.

“Our staff is certainly aware of 

Coach Harbaugh,” Meyer told the 
Columbus Dispatch. “Any time 

the 
adversary 

has 
quality 

people in there, 
you’re 
aware 

of 
everything 

they’re 
doing 

and 
their 

work.”

But just as 

you can bet anything Harbaugh 
does draws attention nationwide, 
you can also bet that his boss, 
Interim Athletic Director Jim 
Hackett, is smiling from his desk, 
trusting the coach he’s admired 
for years.

“This is a rare talent that I’ve 

seen in my life,” Hackett said last 
week. “I’m talking business, peers 
(etc), he’s a rare talent. I told you 
this at the spring game: I’m happier 
with what I thought I was going to 
be delighted about.

“I’ve learned to not worry about 

these types of things … I really 
don’t worry much, there’s very few 
things I fear or worry about.”

In an era with increased media 

scrutiny and people monitoring 
a coach like Harbaugh’s every 
move, Hackett’s lack of worry 
is 
startling. 
Conventional 

wisdom would suggest that an 
Interim Athletic Director at a 
program that seemed to have a 

PR nightmare every 
week 
last 
fall 
is 

supposed to dial back 
the 
publicity, 
not 

encourage it.

Then 
again, 

Harbaugh 
isn’t 

conventional, 
and 

Hackett 
— 
who 

played 
under 
Bo 

Schembechler 
from 

1974-77 — has seen it 
before.

“The 
thing 
I 

contrast with is the 
statue out there -- 
(Bo 
Schembechler), 

if he had been alive 
during social media, 
this 
wouldn’t 
feel 

so idiosyncratic to 
you,” Hackett said. 
“Those personalities 
were always here … 
the media makes it 

transparent.

“What I love about 

it is the authenticity. 
He’s not a second guy in 
the dressing room who 

takes a mask off. He’s authentic.”

Though many 

will still question 
the 
authenticity 

of 
Harbaugh’s 

eccentric 
summer, 
one 

thing that can’t 
be denied is its 
impact. Michigan 
is 
still 
winless 

in 
Harbaugh’s 

tenure, but the buzz around the 
program already feels different. 
Ticket sales are already at their 
highest in years, and even during 

the Ann Arbor Art Fair, the talk of 
the town is still Harbaugh.

“When I’m in the public it’s, 

‘How’s Jim Harbaugh? How’s 
the team doing?’ It’s a good 
excitement,” sophomore receiver 
Moe Ways told reporters on 
Thursday. “Fans are really excited. 
Everybody’s really excited to see 
what we do this year. I think it’s 
going to be a good year, we’re going 
to surprise a lot of people.”

Added Hackett: “He’s a very 

creative, competitive guy. I don’t 
think I’ve ever met a guy who’s 
more competitive. We’re now, 
as a community, glad we’ve got 
somebody like that on our side.”

But 
even 
with 
Harbaugh 

traveling the same world that 
watches his every move, Hackett 
knows the value of keeping 
the coach grounded. He’s not 
going to stop the Jim Harbaugh 
Show, he’ll just make sure it has 
the right numbers — wins, not 
Twitter mentions — to last for a 
few seasons.

“I wear this yellow watch — it’s 

yellow, not maize; they didn’t have 
maize — I wear this to remind 

(Harbaugh) 
he hasn’t won 
a game yet,” 
Hackett said. 
“I’m taking it 
off when he 
wins his first 
game.

“For 
both 

of us, humility 
with all the 

drama is (important). This is 
about 
Michigan 
earning 
its 

rightful place and performing at 
the level that we know we can.”

the public, it’s 

‘How’s Jim

“This is a rare 

talent.”

“I’ve learned 
not to worry 
about things.”
