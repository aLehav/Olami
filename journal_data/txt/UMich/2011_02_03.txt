more violence in
Middle East
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
DailyNewsEditor
Protests in Egypt continued for
a ninth day yesterday as support-
ers of President Hosni Mubarak
attacked demonstrators who con-
tinue to denounce the regime.
Yesterday's conflict came after
Mubarak announced he would
not immediately resign. Instead,
he said he will not run in the
country's upcoming September
elections.
University experts say the ulti-
mate outcome of the conflict is
ambiguous at this point and that
the protests in Cairo could prove
to have greater effects by possibly
sparking riots in other countries
in the region.
Mark Tessler, the University's
vice provost of international
affairs, said in an interview last
night that the gangs attackingthe
protesters were likely being paid

ated the violence.
"The general take of people
who seem to know what they're
talking about is that this has been
adeliberate strategy on thepartof
the government to sow violence,
to try and discredit the protest-
ers, totry and make people think
that there'll be chaos if Mubarak
isn't in power," Tessler said.
He added that he doesn't think
the violence would deter protest-
ers from insisting that Mubarak
resigns. Ultimately, he said, the
uprising's success depends on
whether the Egyptian Army
decides to align with the govern-
ment or with the protesters.
"Right now the 'army has
apparently just been standing
back," Tessler said. "They could
go in and suppress the violence,
they could go in and increase the
violence and try to suppress the
protesters. They haven't done
either of those things so far. They
haven't protected the protesters.
They claim they have a right to
demonstrate and express their
views, lout so far they've just been

Company to
increase workforce
25 percent this year
By K.C. WASSMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Though the country has faced
an ailing economy and a high
national unemployment rate
over the past few years, techno-

logical industries have managed
to weather the economic chal-
lenges, and have even displayed
rapid growth. Amongthese com-
panies is one with a branchTight
in Ann Arbor - Google.
Google announced last week
that 2011 will be one of the larg-
est hiring years for the corpora-
tion, as it begun a national search
for potential employees to match
the growth of its business. And
the upcoming hiring includes

more openings at the company's
Ann Arbor and Birmingham,
Mich. offices.
Google's Midwest Manager
Jake 'arrillo wrote in an e-mail
interview that the company has
had a successful financial period
and is looking forward to wel-
coming new members to its team
in the upcoming year.
"We have just announced a
stellar quarter, and we are pre-
paring for another year of great

success," Parrillo wrote.
According to the Associated
Press, Google intends to hire
more than 6,200 workers in 2011
- an employee increase of more
than 25 percent from 2010.
Google's Ann Arbor office,
located on South Division Street,
is a branch of the company's
AdWords advertising program
that generates most of Google's
revenue. Parrillo wrote that

parking structure.
While some city and Universi-

Arbor City Council members are
skeptical of the structure's con-
struction and intent.
The plans for the parking
structure will be officially pre-
sented to the Ann Arbor City
Council on March 21. On that
date, the council will vote on
whether or not to complete the
construction of the proposed

977-space parking structure,
according to Eli Cooper, Ann

By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
In an attempt to remedy stu-
dent problems ranging from
erratic wireless Internet con-

nections to poor lighting around
campus, the Michigan Student
Assembly and LSA Student Gov-
ernment have launched cam-
paigns in the last several years
to ensure student requests to
improve campus life are ade-
quately addressed by the Uni-
versity administration. Student
government representatives say
their "What to Fix" and "This
Sucks" campaigns have been suc-
cessful in getting students' con-
cerns heard.

MSA's Campus Improvement
Commission launched its What
to Fix campaign abouteightyears
ago, which created an avenue for
students to make University offi-
cials aware of existing issues in
facilities on campus. Campaign
initiatives include Saturday night
dining in residence halls and
extending the hours the Hatcher
Graduate Library to be open on
Friday evenings.

Brothers offer to
fix cars, serenade
students
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
Fraternities are founded in
brotherhood, with men helping
one another. So when a member
of the Lambda Chi Alpha frater-
nity house was injured recently,
the brothers stepped up to lend a
hand. This brother, however, is a
little hairier than the others and

has four legs.
The fraternity member is
named Yikes - the Lambda Chi
house dog. Several months ago,
Yikes was hit by a car, which
broke and dislocated his right
elbow.
Over the past couple weeks,
the brothers of the Lambda Chi
fraternity at the University have
been raising money to pay for
surgery for Yikes, who is about
eight years old. The brothers
have raised more than $250 so
far, but in order pay for Yikes's
$1,855 surgery, they've recruited
the efforts of those outside the

fraternity as well.
Engineering junior Gabe
Johnson, former president of
Lambda Chi and current house
manager, said Yikes is currently
walking with his three function-
al legs. In order to fully heal his
injured leg, he needs to have the
surgery.
To track their fundraising
efforts, the brothers created a
Facebook event titled "Help Fix
Yikes's Leg," which details a list
of services the brothers can pro-
vide in exchange for small fees,
Johnson said.

A fashionable cause

Though purchasing new clothing is
often accompanied by buyer's remorse,
one new group on campus can help
ease thatcguilt.
Life Changing Apparel, an orga-
nization first developed by Cornell
Univeraity alum Peter Cortle, sells
T-shirts and hats to raise money for
clean drinking water in developing
countries. The group donates person-
al water purification systems, called
LifeStraws, to children living in areas
where safe drinking water is sparse.
After hearing about the group from
his sister who attends Cornell, LSA
freshman Howie Robins decided to
create an LCA branch at the University.
Robins said the purpose of the group is
to foster activism among college stu-
dents. The organization aims to appeal
to students through the clothing itsells

and a music blog featured on the LCA
website.
"The goal behind it is to create a
community where people are genu-
inely interested in making change for
the world," Robins said. "And we think
music is a really good gateway or meth-
od of reaching out to people, getting
people united."
The group is trying to establish
itself on campus by raising awareness
about diseases from unclean drinking
water that specifically affect children
and how to increase water purification
efforts around the globe, Robins said.
To do this, the group plans to host an
event for World Water Day on March
22.
"There's so many diseases like
cholera and dysentery that are all
waterborne, and (children) dont have

any choice so they have to drink that
water," Robins said. "So many children
die because they get these diseases
from the water."
while the group mainly sells T-shirts
to raise funds for the LifeStraws, the
organization is looking to expand its
merchandise to sweatshirts, collared
shirts and button-downs.
Cortle wrote in an e-mail interview
that he originally developed the group
based oncthe idea that selling apparelcto
college students for a cause and raising
awareness about issues like safe drink-
ing water can have a big impact.
"It really is something most of us
take for granted, and we can easily
provide clean water to the thousands
of people who die from water-related
disease every day," Cortle wrote.

Unrest in Egypt
causes uncertainty
after highest finish
since June 2008
NEW YORE (AP) - Stocks
ended yesterday mixed,'a day
after the Dow Jones industrial
average closed above 12,000 for
the first time since June 2008.
The Dow traded in a tight
range throughout the day as
investors weighed the impact of
unrest in Egypt against better-
than-expected news on the job
market.
"The market seems to be
catching its breath after that
strong run Tuesday," said Alan
Gayle, senior investment strat-

egist for RidgeWorth invest-
ments.
Traders' television screens
were filled with scenes of fight-
ing in Egypt between groups
that support President Hosni
Mubarak and those who are
calling for his ouster. Mubarak
vowed Tuesday that he will not
run for president in September
but did not say he would take
any steps to leave office before
then.
Egypt is not a major produc-
er of oil but controls the Suez
Canal, a key shipping lane in the
global oil business. Oil prices
fluctuated throughout the day
as traders balanced the clashes
in Egypt with a report that fuel
supplies were growing in the
U.S. Oil settled 9 cents higher at
$90.86 a barrel on the New York

Mercantile Exchange.
The Dow rose 1.81 points to
end the day at 12,041.97. That's
the highest close since June 19,
2008.
The Standard & Poor's 500
index lost 3.56 points, or 0.3
percent, to 1,304.03. Nine of its
10 company groups fell. Finan-
cial companies had the largest
fall of any group, dropping 0.9
percent.
The Nasdaq composite lost
1.63 points, or less than 0.1 per-
cent, to 2,749.56.
Early yesterday, payroll pro-
cessor ADP said that private
companies added more jobs in
January than analysts predict-
ed. That's a hopeful sign for the
Labor Department's monthly
employment report, due out Fri-
day.
Economists expect the gov-
ernment to say the unemploy-
ment rate rose to 9.S percent in
January from 9.4 percent the
previous month.
Time Warner Inc. rose almost
9 percent after the owner of War-
ner Bros., HBO and CNN said its
fourth-quarter profit jumped
22 percent. The company also
raised its 2011 forecasts.
Video game publisher Elec-
tronic Arts Inc. jumped 16 per-
cent after the company also
raised its profit forecast. The
company was the best performer
in the S&P S0O.
Mattel Inc. gained 1 percent
after the country's largest toy
maker said its revenue rose 9
percent on strong sales of Barbie
and Fisher-Price toys. Whirl-
pool Corp. fell 2 percent after
the company said it would raise
prices in response to higher costs
of raw materials.
Treasury prices fell, pushing
their yields higher. The yield on
the 10-year Treasury note rose
to 3.48 percent from 3.43 percent
late Tuesday.
Falling shares outpaced rising
ones by a small margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. Trad-
ing volume came to 4.15 billion
shares.

Thousands flee to
evacuation centers,
no deaths reported
CAIRNS, Australia (AP) - A
massive cyclone struck north-
eastern Australia early today,
tearing off roofs, toppling trees
and cutting electricity to thou-
sands - the most powerful storm
to hit the area in nearly a century.
The eye of Cyclone Yasi roared
ashore at the small resort town
of Mission Beach in Queensland
state, battering the coast known
to tourists as the gateway to the
Great Barrier Reef with heavy
rain and howling winds gusting
to 186 mph (300 kph).
"Vegetation has been reduced
to sticks," said Sgt. Dan Gallagher,
Mission Beach officer in charge.
Yasi compounded the suffering
for Queensland, waterlogged by
months of flooding that killed 35
people and inundated hundreds
of communities. It struck an urea
far north of the flood zone, but
the Bureau of Meteorology said
its drenching rains could cause
floods in new parts of the state.

The extent of property damage
across Queensland was unknown
just before dawn because it was
still too dangerous to venture
very far outside homes and evac-
uation centers, with strong winds
and torrential rain continuing to
batter towns.
No deaths or serious injuries
have been reported.
About 175,000 people were
without power, and restoring it
would be a major priority when
the storm had fully passed,
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh
said.-
"This has been ... a terrify-
ing experience, but this morning
because so many of them did take
precautions, it seems that we cer-
tainly kept people safe in those
centers and Inm very pleased
about that,' Bligh said. "The
early news is not anything like I
expected to hear this morning...
I do stress in many cases we are
yet to see any assessments."
More than 10,000 people fled
to 20 evacuation. centers in a
danger zone stretching 190 miles
(300 kilometers), amid strong
wurnings in the past two days.
Many others moved in with fain-

ily or friends in safer locations.
Still, authorities prepared for the
worst, including serious damage
devastation and possible deaths.
Witnesses reported roofs
being ripped off, buildings shak-
ing and trees flattened under the
power of the winds. Officials said
the storm surge would flood some
places to roof level
"This is a cyclone of savagery
and intensity," Prime Minister
Julia Gillard said in a nationally
televised news conference as the
storm moved toward the coast.
"People are facing some really
dreadful hours in front of them."
The storm's front was about
300 miles (500 kilometers)
across, with the worst of the
winds expected to lash the coast
for up to four hours, although
blustery conditions and heavy
rain could last for a day.
"It's such a big storm - it's a
monster, killer storm," Bligh had
said Wednesday, adding that the
only previous cyclone measured
in'the state at such strength was
in 1918. "This impact is likely to
be more life-threatening than
any experienced during recent*
generations."

The U.S. Coast Guard says it
has rescued a snowmobiler who
floated into Lake Erie from Cana-

climbing onto a loose piece of ice
about the size of a football field.
Jim Turton of Colchester,
Ontario, floated for about nine
hours before being rescued at
about 8:30 a.m. yesterday - his
45th birthday - by the crew of
an ice-breaking tug temporarily
assigned to the Great Lakes from
New London, Conn.
Officials say Turton was one

Chicago halted by
massive snowstorm

Tuesday's blizzard
deemed worst in
city history
CHICAGO (AP) - Lindsey
Wilson was on Lake Shore Drive,
but she couldn't tell where. It
was dark, and the snow swirling
around the stranded bus made it
impossible to see anything but the
closest cars.
There was talk among her fel-
low commuters of 25-foot waves
washing up from Lake Michigan
and about when the bus might
get going, but nobody knew any-
thing - not the driver, not the
emergency operators passengers
were calling, and not the shiver-
ing motorists climbing aboard
to keep warm after firefighters
pulled them from their cars.
When a group of passengers
decided enough was enough and
started to walk, she joined them.
"I got 100 feet, everything was
an orange hue, there was snow in
my face, I couldn't see anything,
I turned around and couldn't see
the bus and I thought I was going
to die," she said yesterday morn-
ing.
Wilson, 26, was among hun-
dreds of people in at least 1,500
vehicles who found themselves
trappedonChicago'smostfamous
stretch of road for as long as 12
hours Tuesday night and yester-
day morning during one of the
worst snow storms in the city's

history. The situation was among
the worst impacts from the win-

roadway looked like rush hour
had been stopped in time. Three
lanes of cars cluttered the road
with snow reaching as high as
the windshields. Some cars were
almost completely buried. Bull-
dozers worked to clear the snow
from around the cars, then tow
trucks plucked them out of snow
drifts one by one.
The stranded vehicleswere the
worst breakdown in Chicago's
handling of the storm.
Some motorists came away
angry, frustrated and puzzled at
why the city didn't close the cru-
cial thoroughfare earlier, or why
officials didn't anticipate that a
bus accident could clog itup like a
cork in a bottle.
"In 31 years with the city, I
haven't experienced anything like
we did at Lake Shore Drive," said
Raymond Orozco, Mayor Richard
M. Daley's chief of staff.
Orozco said more than 130 fire-
fighters, some on snowmobiles,
and 100 police officers were sent
to the road.
As they sat and waited, the
stranded motorists gratefully
gobbled down granola bars and
drank coffee and Gatorade,
brought to them by Good Samari-
tans who climbed fences and rail-
ings to deliverthem.

Marouf al-Bakhit delivers a speech in Amman, Jordan on July 13, 2010. Jordan's King Abdullah sacked his government Feb.
1, 2011 in the wake of street protests and nominated ex-army general Marouf al-Bakhit as his prime minister-designate.
Jordan Islamists call for
new leader to step down

Egyptian protests
spark civil unrest in
neighbor country
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) - Jor-
dan's powerful Muslim oppo-
sition on yesterday urged the
country's newly appointed prime
minister to step down, calling
him the wrong person to intro-
duce democratic reforms and
tackle deepening poverty and
unemployment.
Also, Jordan's King Abdul-
lah II made a surprise visit to an
impoverished northern village.
It was his first such trip since
the unrest broke out in neigh-
boring Egypt, and appeared to
be an attempt to defuse popular
anger over the country's troubles
and portray himself as a caring
leader.
On Tuesday, Abdullah named
Marouf al-Bakhit prime minis-
ter, bowing to public pressure
from protests inspired by those
in Egypt against President Hosni
Mubarak.
Hamza Mansour, a leader of
the opposition Muslim Brother-
hood's political wing, rejected
al-Bakhit's nomination, saying

he "is not the right person for the
job."
"Al-Bakhit is a security man,
a former army general and ex-
intelligence official. He doesn't
believe in democracy," Man-
sour told The Associated Press.
Instead, he said the country
needs "a national figure who can
tackle Jordan's serious economic
and political crisis."
Jordan is grappling with a
soaring foreign debt estimated
at $15 billion, an inflation rate
which has swelled by 1.5 percent
to 6.1 percent in December and
high unemployment and poverty
rates - set at 12 and 25 percent
respectively.
Mansour also criticized al-
Bakhit for signing off on Jordan's
first casino, which the Brother-
hood strongly opposed on the
grounds that it violated Islamic
principles and encouraged vice.
The project was later canceled.
On Tuesday, King Abdullah,
facing public pressure inspired
by the revolt in Tunisia and
Egypt, sacked his government
and named al-Bakhit as prime
minister, ordering him to move
quickly to boosteconomic oppor-
tunities and give Jordanians a
greater say in politics.

Al-Bakhit, 63, is a former
ambassador to Israel who sup-
ports strong ties with the U.S.
and Jordan's peace treaty with
Israel-policieswhichtheBroth-
erhood and the leftists oppose.
The fundamentalist Brother-
hood advocates the introduction
of strict Islamic sharia law, close
relations with Muslim nations
and Israel's destruction.
Many Jordanians see al-Bakh-
it as a tough enforcer of security,
which goes against their calls for
greater democratic freedoms.
Al-Bakhit is an ex-army major
general who also served as the
chief of Jordan's National Secu-
rity Agency in the last decade.
He is credited with maintaining
Jordan's stability following the
2005 triple attacks on hotels in
Amman, claimed by al-Qaida in
Iraq.
At a small protest Wednes-
day near al-Bakhit's office, left-
ist activist Hadi Khitan said
al-Bakhit was. to different from
deposed Prime Minister Samir
Rifai.
"We want to change govern-
ment policies, not change prime
ministers," he said. "We want
a real political change and this
message should reach the king."

ancient structure
HIRBET MADRAS, Israel (AP)
- Israeli archaeologists present-
ed a newly uncovered 1,500-year-
old church in the Judean hills on
yesterday, including an unusually-
well-preserved mosaic floor with
images of lions, foxes, fish and
peacocks.
The Byzantine church located
southwest of Jerusalem, exca-
vated over the last two months,
will be visible only for another
week before archaeologists cover
it again with soil for its own pro-
tection.
The small basilica with an
exquisitely decorated floor was
active between the fifth and sev-
enth centuries A.D., said the dig's
leader, Amir Ganor of the Israel
Antiquities Authority. He said the
floor was "one of the most beau-
tiful mosaics to be uncovered in

saia.
Archaeologists began dig-
ging at the site, known as Hirbet
Madras, in December. The Antiq-
uities Authority discovered sever-
al months earlier that antiquities
thieves had begun plundering the
ruins,which sit on an uninhabited
hill not far from an Israeli farm-
ing community.
Though an initial survey sug-
gested the building was a syna-
gogue, the excavation revealed
stones carved with crosses, iden-
tifying it as a church. The build-
ing had been built atop another
structure around 500 years older,
dating to Roman times, when
scholars believe 'the settlement
was inhabitedby Jews.
Hewn into the rock underneath
that structure is a network of tun-
nels that archaeologists believe
were used by Jewish rebels fight-
ing Roman armies in the second
century A.D.

Dutch Jews seek more immediate
punishment for Holocaust deniers

Rise in racist
remarks brings
about request for
stricter justice
AMSTERDAM (AP) - Jew-
ish groups in the Netherlands
called yesterday for swifter pun-
ishment for Holocaust deniers as
parliament debated how to com-
bat rising anti-Semitism.
Among other measures, a
Jewish umbrella organization
said it wants Holocaust deniers
punished under rules usually
reserved for drunk drivers, shop-
lifters, and football hooligans.
Under the "snelrecht," or "fast
justice" policy, police and pros-
ecutors offer offenders a choice
immediately after their arrest
between a fine or a court appear-
ance within two months.
"I don't understand why it
should be difficult for policeman
to give a fine directly to perpe-
trators of these remarks," said
Ronny Naftaniel of The Center
for Information and Documenta-
tion on Israel, or CIDI, in a tele-
phone interview.
He added that he would sup-
port the same measure for anti-
Moroccan discrimination, which
is also on the rise in the Nether-
lands.
Anti-Semitism has become a
hot-button issue as many native
Dutch blame anti-Semitism on
the country's Muslim minority,
while Muslims say there is a dou-
ble standard and discrimination
against those of Moroccan and
Turkish ancestry goes unpun-
ished.
A national police report in

September found a 48 percent
rise in anti-Semitic incidents to
209 in 2009. The same report
found that anti-Moroccan inci-
dents rose 17 percentto 103.
After a wave of immigration
in the 1990s Muslims make up
around 1 million of the coun-
try's 16 million population. After
being decimated during World
War II, the Dutch Jewish popu-
lation is estimated at 40,000-
50,000.
Rising anti-Semitism "can be
attributed to the rise of influence
of Islam inthe Netherlands," said
Freedom party member of par-
liament Joram van Klaveren dur-
ing the debate. "The more Islam,
the more anti-Semitism."
Cora van Nieuwenhuizen,
whose VVD party leads the
country's ruling conservative
coalition, was among several
MPs who rejected those remarks.
"It's not your belief that
counts, but your behavior," she
said.
The exchange reflects the
state of politics in the Nether-
lands.
A popular backlash against
Muslim immigrants intensified
in 2004 when filmmaker Theo
van Gogh was murdered by an
Islamic radical of Moroccan
descent, over perceived religious
insults.
The 2008 European Commis-
sion against Racism and Intoler-
ance found that there has been
a "dramatic increase in 'Islamo-
phobia' in the Netherlands" since
2001.
In national elections last
year, the explicitly anti-Islam
Freedom Party finished in third
place. It is not part of the coun-
try's minority government, but

props up the administration by
supporting it on key votes in par-
liament.
Naftaniel of CIDI said his
research showed Moroccan
youth are disproportionately
involved in anti-Semitic inci-
dents targeting "visible" Ortho-
dox Jews. However, he said
anti-Jewish remarks on the
Internet or in the workplace
were usually made by Dutch
Christians.
"We have the idea the taboo on
anti-Semitism is diminishing,"
he said.
In one recent high-profile case
a Moroccan minor was inter-
viewed by a shock news website
saying he thought Jews should be
"exterminated."
The Utrecht District Court
sentenced him to 40 hours of
community service, including 16
at the Anne Frank House.
Last April the same court
acquitted Abdoulmouthalib
Bouzerda, chairman of the Arab
European League, of hate speech
charges for publishing a cartoon
on its website questioning the
reality of the Holocaust.
The group had intended to
spur a public discussion about
a perceived double standard:
that European media are will-
ing to publish cartoons mocking
Islam's prophet Muhammad,
while cartoons about the Holo-
caust are taboo.
Van Klaveren of the Free-
dom party was skeptical about
the proposal of "fast justice"
for anti-Semitic remarks: His
party's leader Geert Wilders is
on trial for alleged discrimina-
tory remarks - including some
equating Islam with fascism and
calling for a ban on the Quran.

Insuring the choice
House Republicans cannot limit women's rights
Women in the United States have a right to choose
what they want to do with their bodies. But U.S.
House of Representatives Republicans are trying
to restrict legal abortion procedures by introducing H.R. 3,
the "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act." The bill quali-
fies exemptions to the existing prohibition of taxpayer-fund-
ed abortions while making the ban permanent. Though H.R.
3 is unlikely to overcome a Democratic majority in the U.S.
Senate and a presidential veto to become law, it's a concerning
attempt to restrict women's legal rights. The offensive legisla-
tion is a waste of time and should be rejected by Congress as
soon as it comes to a vote.

On Jan. 20, Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.)
introduced H.R. 3, which has the support of
Republican leadership and 173 co-sponsors.
The bill modifies the provisions of the Hyde
Amendment, a provision that prohibits fed-
eral funding for abortion except in cases of
rape, incest and when the life of a woman is
threatened. Under the proposed legislation,
the exception for rape has been changed to
an exception for "forcible rape." The ban
on federally funded abortions would also
become permanent - the Hyde Amendment
would no longer need to be passed yearly as
part of the budget.
Lawmakers need to understand that abor-
tion has been alegal medical procedure in the
U.S. since Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade
in 1973. Restricting the procedure would take
away from a woman's right to choose that's
protected by the Constitution. Threaten-
ing this right through proposals like H.R. 3
puts citizens on a dangerous path to deny-
ing women's rights. Though steps could be
taken to reduce the number of abortions, the
approach that House Republicans have taken
is wrong and lacks foresight of the potential
consequences the bill might have.
Most disturbingly, H.R. 3 threatens the abil-
ity of rape victims to undergo an abortion by

qualifying the existing exemptions to prohibit
federal funding for abortions. The wording for
the exception of "rape" has been changed to
"forcible rape." The legislators' intensions are
unclear and, to a degree, alarming - the word
rape is defined as sexual intercourse without
consent. Arguing semantics with such a seri-
ous and sensitive issue insults rape victims
and all women. This is the most egregious
facet of the bill and is enough reason alone to
drop the legislation.
To make matters worse, H.R. 3 is a waste
of time, since the legislation has little chance
of becoming law. Ironically, this isn't new to
House Republicans, who campaigned dur-
ing the midterm elections under promises of
change and effective governance. Instead,
they've chosen frill over form, reading the
Constitution on the floor of the House and
making futile attempts to repeal President
Barack Obama's health care bill. Republicans
should stop playing rehearsed political games
and engage Democrats in substantive policy
debates that produce positive outcomes for the
American people.
The health and well-being of Americans
isn't something that should be compromised
for partisan gain. Congress must resist this
offensive campaign against women's rights.

P resident Barack Obama's
commencement speech in
Michigan Stadium last spring
was characteris-
tically eloquent
and powerful,
with narratives
of "real Ameri-
cans," moments
of levity, tales
of the found-
ing fathers and
all the grandeur MATT
befitting a presi- AARONSON
dent's biggest
public appear-
ance since his inauguration.
Sure, his address was dishearten-
ingly political and it lacked anything
resemblingthe bigannouncements of
presidential speakers past (Lyndon
Johnson laid out plans for his Great
Society programs in the Big House in
1964). But even Obama detractors -
they were in there somewhere - had
to admit it was cool to be inducted
into real life by the leader of the free
world.
Many of us came to a realization
within minutes of finding out Obama
would be here in 2010: The class of
2011 may be in store for a serious let-
down.
Go ahead, call us the entitled gen-
eration. I call it unavoidable recency
bias. Any speaker would be a disap-
pointment following a president.
Rick Snyder, Michigan's new
governor, is the obvious choice for
this year's commencement. A great
choice, actually. He has three degrees
from the University. He broke the
tradition of living in the governor's
mansion to instead remain an Ann
Arbor residenst. As a longtime ven-
ture capitalist who once called the
shots for Gateway, he's earned a'
reputation as a champion of innova-
tion. The previous four governors all

sent off Wolverine graduates whilemin
office, including Snyder's predeces-
sor, Jennifer Granholm, who spoke,
in the year of her inauguration.
I can hear the basic outline of his
speech already. He'll share a nostal-
gic story and corresponding life les-
son from his days as a student here.
He'll assure everybodythathe'sjust a
"nerd" and abusinessman, notapoli-
tician. He'll talk about jobs, jobs, jobs.
He'll say something like "putting
Michigan back to work starts with
you." He'll make those of us leaving
Michigan to work elsewhere into
the unspoken villains of the "brain
drain."
If the University selects Snyder,.
it won't be the end of the world. I
like Snyder. In fact, he was the first
Republican I've ever voted for. But
I'll eat my cap and gown if a Snyder
speech doesn't satisfy the aforemen-
tioned predictions. And that's the
problem - he would be entirely too
predictable. He'd be another politi-
cian, except, well, he's not the presi-
dent.
In my conversations with fellow
class of 2011 Wolverines, I've sug-
gested - to near-unanimous agree-
ment - that if there's one person
capable of matching or topping the
excitement for Obama, it's Jon Stew-
art.
To say "The Daily Show" host is
popular among Michigan students .
would be an understatement. He's
almost universally admired on this
campus, and many keep an 11 p.m.
weeknight appointment to watch
Stewart challenge conventional
knowledge (and make fart jokes) on
Comedy Central.
While he often downplays his
influence by insisting he's just a
comedian, Stewart is dependably
sincere in a way no politician could
ever be. He combines insight and

debate with entertainment - not to
dumb it down for his demographic
(that's us), but because that's how he
can best shed light on issues.
For this, people like us trust him
and identify with him in a way we
rarelyidentifywithpeople morethan
twice our age.By keepingus laughing
and thinking critically in a format
that stays on top of the cable news
cycle, Stewart has become a singular
figure in our cultural landscape.
"The Daily Show"
host is popular
among students.,
Can Michigan land him? Who
knows? The University can't deliver
a crowd to match that of Stewart's
last large public speaking engage-
ment - October's "Rally to Restore
Fear and/or Sanity," during which
Stewart and his Tv faux-foe Stephen
Colbert performed for an estimated
215,000 on the National Mall. But
the Big House represents at least
an opportunity to one-up Colbert -
the total capacity at Northwestern
University's stadium, where Colbert
has committed to speak this spring,
is 47,130 people, while an estimated
80,000 turned out for Obama last
year in Ann Arbor.
Stewart should at least be sought
out. He's notoriouslyunafraidof say-
ing "this is absurd," and as we enter
aworld as uncertain as it'sever been,
who better to mark the transition?

EITAN NEUMARK AND MANDY KAIN I

Participate in Purple Week Elevate conversation about Israel

It's truly unfortunate that there are very
few individuals, like myself, lucky enough
to not have been deeply affected by cancer.
Though one of my grandfathers died of colon
cancer, it was long before I was born, and hav-
ing never met him, cancer remained for me a
theoretical. All I knew was that it was some-
thing really bad that could happen, but with-
out experiencing the sickness firsthand, I had
no way of comprehending the trauma that
came along with the disease.
Strangely, whatreally prompted my involve-
ment in Relay For Life wan't cancer, but rather
the absence of cancer in my life. When I was
16, my mom sat down on my bed one Satur-
day morning to say something "important."
I remember being pretty ticked off that she
was in my room without knocking and at the
ungodly hour of 10 a.m. on a weekend. She
had never said anything like that before, and
I couldn't imagine what would be so vital that
she just had to wake me up to share it. My
scowl in her direction quickly melted from
my face, however, when she told me that she
would be having a hysterectomy because a
recent doctor's visit had shown a great like-
lihood of ovarian cancer. I felt as though my
heart had grown to a size just slightlytoo large
for containment in my chest, and the flow of
tears came instantly. I was the most scared
I had ever been, and nothing had even hap-
pened. Nothing was even definite.
The following week came and my mom's
surgery was scheduled on Rosh Hashanah.
It was a Jewish holiday meant to be spent
with family, and I couldn't have been further
removed from mine. Though my parents were
only one hour away at the hospital, the uncer-
tainty created a torturous divide. I spent the
day with a friend, feeling helpless and hang-
ing on to every purposefully vague conversa-
tion with my father. The surgery took hours,
and even long after its completion, the doctors

still had no final answer. It wasn't until the
next morning that I awoke early to a tearful
but relieved call from my dad saying every-
thing was fine and the tests had come up nega-
tive for cancer. He'd said everything was fine,
but everything was most definitely not fine.
A week of my life had been ruined by just
the very idea of cancer, and the thought that
I could have received the opposite phone call
was paralyzing. And the fear and anxiety I felt
has stuck with me ever since.
One week of terror leading to an ultimately
benign result is absolutely nothing compared
to what many people have to deal with, and
understanding only a fraction of that pain was
enough to teach me that something had to be
done. The instantaneous panic that comes
from hearinga single word is simplyunaccept-
able and that was when I decided to become a
part of Relay For Life.
Now for the shameless promotion: Support
Relay For Life and The American Cancer Soci-
ety. But really, how could you not agree with
the sentiment? This week - Jan. 30 through
Feb. 4 - is Relay For Life's "Purple Week," a
time for promoting the fight against cancer
through some awesome fundraisers, including
restaurant nights, a bar night and Relay's Got
Talent finishing it off. See the Relay For Life
Facebook page for event details and mrelay.
org for more information.
If you're not convinced, I would say imag-
ine someone you know having cancer, but
please don't do that. The fact is, if you haven't
been there, you (and I) simply can't fathom
how tremendously awful that would be.
Instead, just think of the possibility of a loved
one developing cancer, and consider the terror
that a stupid six-letter word carries. That's all
it should take.

Too often, whenever the Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict is discussed, crucial issues remain hidden behind
rehearsed rhetoric. This leaves little room for an effec-
tive, open dialogue. It's tempting to make such black and
white arguments. But these aren't the strategiesthat will
achieve a lasting peace, and they don't reflect the com-
plications and nuances of the conflict. Nor do they allow
us to recognize the reality in which people in the region
live - or the often-unproductive context in which the
conversation unfolds here in the United States.
Daniel Luks's article (In defense of Israel,1/24/2011)
exemplifiesthis tendency to substitute analysis for rheto-
ric. While he may feel that Palestinians are implicated in
Egypt's discrimination against Sudanese refugees, solely
for sharing a race and ethnicity, J Street UMich doesn't
agree with such broad, sweeping statements. Similarly,
while he may feel that Israel's support for its gay commu-
nity justifies its continued discrimination against Pales-
tinians inside and outside of the West Bank and Gaza, we
don't subscribe to such simplistic arguments.
Campus conversations using these simplistic argu-
ments have long been dominated by those who are pro-
Israel or those who are pro-Palestine. Each discussion
turned into an argument. Each fact met with a counter
fact. Voices were raised and emotions ran high. People
left these exchanges angrier rather than more under-
standing. We at J Street UMich recognize that this
campus atmosphere must change and nuance must be
realized.
J Street UMich is, first and foremost, a pro-Israel
group. We believe that Israel has a rightful and important
place in the family of nations. The concept of a homeland
in Israel for us will always be treasured and supported.
Our love for Israel is like love for family, constant and
enduring. However, just like any close-knit family, we
are not uninvolved and uncritical in each other's affairs
- we observe, we advise and, when necessary, we nag
because we want the best for our family, and we want
our family to be its best.
This definition of pro-Israel doesn't match up with
that of many who claim the term. We do not seek to sup-
port each and every Israeli policy, nor do we think such
a defense serves Israel nor our own community. To sub-

scribe to such a version of support would be to deny the
very democratic values we hold true both as Americans
and as supporters of Israel's democracy. In addition, it
perpetuates a status quo in the Middle East, which is
unsustainable for Israelis and Palestinians.
For J Street, to be pro-Israelisto wrestle in deep affec-
tion and agreement and deep disagreement with many
of Israel's policies, chief among them an occupation that
now stretches into its fifth decade. To be pro-Israel for
us is to recognize that such an occupation betrays our
values and threatens to undermine the very possibility
of Israel's democratic future. To be pro-Israel is to there-
fore support a future state of Palestine and to do all we
can to bring it about. This is the only way that we believe
one can be pro-Israel and pro-Peace.
A two-state solution, with Israelis and Palestinians
living side-by-side in peace and security, is the only
answer to this conflict that will allow an expedient end
to the occupation and the possibility of democratic self-
determination for both peoples. This requires intelli-
gent, critical and reasoned dialogue, not empty rhetoric.
It requires a drastic change in how these types of con-
versations are had. And it requires a range ofviewpoints
that reflects the nuanced opinions of the Jewish com-
munity.
There will always be those who wishcto reducethe dis-
cussion to a series of black and white talking points. But
it's in the best interest of our community and Israel for
us to come together and create one community commit-
ted to Israel. J Street U National and J Street represent
thousands of American Jews who live firmly in the world
of nuance - who love Israel, actively work for peace and
believe that relationship requires tough conversations
and a real commitmentto Jewish and democratic values.
On campus we must elevate the level of conversation by
avoiding broad sweeping generalizations and recogniz-
ing hard truths and difficult complexities to find com-
mon ground that will set the stage for inclusion and
progress.

UMich by LSA freshman Eitan Neumark and
Rackham graduate student Mandy Kain.

EGYPT
From Page 1A
standing aside."
Yesterday, soldiers encircled
Cairo's Tahrir Square, sporadical-
ly firing bullets into the air, but not
getting involved in the battle. The
violence has been fatal, leaving
three people dead and more than
600 injured in the Tahrir Square
protests yesterday.
The protests began on Jan. 25
as protesters, inspired by the over-
throw of the Tunisian government

last month, organized demon-
strations on Facebook and Twit-
ter, according to Michael Dobbs,
Communications Studies lecturer
at the University.
Egyptians used social media
sites and the blogosphere to
express dissenting opinions and
build resentment against the
government before the protests
began, Dobbs, a former Washing-
ton Post foreign correspondent,
said in an interview last night.
"For a long time, Egyptian
bloggers have been writing about
police brutality," Dobbs said.

"Police have been pretty indis-
criminate in beating people up."
Dobbs discussed the instance
of an Egyptian man, Khalid Said,
who drew support from people via
the Internet after the public found
out that the police beat him last
year.
"(Said) died as a result of his
injuries, and in the Egyptian
blogosphere, this became a huge
controversy," Dobbs said. "The
slogan'We are all Khalid Said' was
one of the slogansthatbroughtthe
people into the streets recently."
The Egyptian government par-

tially shut down Internet service
and limited mobile communica-
tion last week in an effort to sup-
press the protests. Dobbs said by
the time the Internet was cut off,
it was already too late to quell the
protests.
"Friday is a day of prayer in
the Muslim world, and of course
people were coming out of their
mosques," Dobbs said. "There
are other ways of keeping people
informed - just going to your
mosque and talking to people.
Even if the Internet was shut
down, it didn't mean that every-

thing relied on the Internet."
After yesterday's violent epi-
sodes, it is uncertain whether the
protesterswill succeed or whether
Mubarak will regain control. Tes-
sler said the Cairo protests could
have ramifications throughout the
Middle East, as the uprising could
inspire other countries in the
region to stage similar protests.
In the past week, in order to
prevent revolts in their respec-
tive countries, King Abdullah II
of Jordan dismissed the govern-
ment, and Yemen's President Ali
Abdullah Saleh announced that

he wouldn't seek re-election. The
leaders were trying to demon-
strate to the nations' people that
they are trying to embrace demo-
cratic reform, Tessler said.
"The conditions that prompted
(what happened in Egypt) exist
in all these other places," Tessler
said. "It's a little different from
place to place, but as a general
proposition, they exist in most of
the counties in the region. That
was the case in Tunisia as well."

CAMPAIGNS
From Page 1A
MSA vice speaker and chair of the
Campus Improvement Commis-
sion, said though the campaign
 has changed forms throughout
the years - moving from writ-
ten submissions to digital sub-
missions - it has been consistent
in making students the focus in
advocating for changes at the Uni-
versity.
"The What to Fix campaign
allows us to reach out to stu-
dents, and it's one way that we get
feedback from our constituents
regarding what's going on with
campus issues," Walser said.
Walser, who began work with
What to Fix in September 2010,
said MSA has been successful
advertising the campaign this
academic year. MSA representa-
tives have been speaking with
students in Mason Hall about
campus issues every week this
semester and using tactics like

distributing wristbands and pens
to spread the message.
Last week, MSA members were
particularly impressed with stu-
dent input, having received 120
ideas for campus improvements
after promoting the campaign
in Mason Hall for three hours,
Walser said.
This year, in addition to advo-
cating for Saturday night dining
in residence halls, What to Fix has
been working to improve wireless
Internet connections in Angell
Hall auditoriums and to address
various issues in the Central Cam-
pus Recreation Building and Sha-
piro Undergraduate Library.
According to Walser, 10 indi-
viduals officially work on the
What to Fix campaign. However,
other members of the assembly
participate in What to Fix proj-
ects if they are relevant to their
respective commissions.
Business senior Alex Serwer,
MSA chief of staff and former
chair of the Campus Improve-
ment Commission, said MSA and

LSA-SG are interested in collabo-
ration efforts for campus-wide
improvements based on sugges-
tions the two governments have
received.
"We really hope that students
utilize this campaign in a way that
lets (MSA) know which things
are the most important to them
so that we can devote our time
accordingly," Serwer said.
In a similar attempt to improve
students' experiences on campus,
LSA-SG began the This Sucks
campaign as a project of its Stu-
dent Life Committee about five or
six years ago. The studentgovern-
ment started the initiative after
receiving many complaints about
various things on campus, accord-
ing to LSA junior Brandon Byrd,
Student Life Committee chair.
This Sucks allows students to
send their complaints directly
to LSA-SG executives and com-
mittee chairs via e-mail, and
the complaints are routed to the
appropriate committee within
LSA-SG best suited to respond to

the issue, Byrd wrote in an e-mail
interview.
Byrd wrote that This Sucks is
what first attracted him to LSA-
SG and that the campaign has
grown since he first began work-
ing on it during the winter semes-
ter of his freshman year. In recent
years, LSA-SG began advertising
This Sucks through involvement
in Diag Days on campus, as well as
through e-mails sent to students
within the school.
"Last semester, we put on a
This Sucks Diag Day where we
had a banner that students could
write their complaints on, and the
response was phenomenal," Byrd
wrote. "A lot of the ideas that were
on the banner are now projects
that LSA-SG is working on right
now."
Since Byrd first began his work
with This Sucks, some of the
most notable improvements LSA-
SG has made on campus include
better lighting in the basements
of the Michigan Union and the
Michigan League and healthier

options for students in dining hall
cafes like Ciao Down Pizzeria in
West Quad and Victors in Mosh-
er-Jordan residence hall.
"I think what separates This
Sucks from other similar e-mail
systems is that we keep the stu-
dents updated with our progress
on their issue," Byrd wrote. "This
year This Sucks is looking to
expand even more and to take on
even more projects."
In light of several crime alerts
on campus in recent months,
This Sucks is currently working,
on a campus lighting initiative,
with a specific focus on the area
surrounding the bridge near the
CCRB. LSA-SG plans to eventu-
ally expand the project into a
campus-wide initiative, according
to Byrd.
Though both campaigns have
similar goals, LSA-SG and MSA
haven't joined their respective
movements. But according to
Byrd, the student governments
plan to meet to determine ways
they might be able to work togeth-

er in the future.
LSA senior Kashif Ahmed said
he has heard about the student
governments' programs through
Facebook but, like several other
students, said he doesn't know
much about them. He said he
thinks LSA-SG should focus on
bathroom maintenance in cam-
pus buildings and increasing
University bus service at night
on weekends. He said the latter
is especially important given the
recent influx of robberies in the
Oxbridge neighborhood.
LSA senior Jerry Ilar said he
has yet to give his input through
the MSA or LSA-SG campaigns
and doesn't foresee using them in
the future since he doesn't think
they have led to changes on cam-
pus.
"I haven't personally used
(either of the resources), but I also
haven't really seen any impacts,"
Ilar said.

"We employ a good number

According to the Google hiring

hoping to fill positions in account

Parrillo wrote that he couldn't

FULLER ROAD
From Page 1A
Ann Arbor-Howell corridor and
the relocation of the existing Ann
Arbor Amtrak station.
The Fuller Road transit station
project also consists of the con-
struction of a new train station,
rail platforms, a bus transit. cen-
ter and bike storage, Cooper said.
The plan would also relocate
the existing Amtrak Station to
the Fuller Road site within the
next few decades since parking is
insufficient at the current station
located at 325 Depot St., Cooper
said. He added that the proposed

train station would be more con-
venient since it wouldbe closer to
the University's campus.
The ultimate goal of the proj-
ect is to meet the needs of the
Ann Arbor community by mak-
ing transportation more accessi-
ble and convenient, Cooper said.
According to the Ann Arbor
Connector Feasibility Study
conducted last June, 30,000 to
40,000 students use the Fuller
Road site each day, so the chang-
es would make "getting around
Ann Arbor easier," Cooper said.
"(The Fuller Road transit sta-
tion) has an ability to represent
a paradigm shift for the commu-
nity, including students," he said.

According to a Jan. 18, 2010
article in The Michigan Daily,
the University will pay 78 percent
of all construction costs for the
station, totaling $36 million, and
thus entitling University-affili-
ated individuals to 78 percent of
parking spots in the structure.
Jim Kosteva, the University's
director of community relations,
said the project is going to benefit
the entire city as well as the Uni-
versity.
"This is a partnership," Koste-
va said. "This is a community,
and as their partner, there will be
mutual benefits.".
He added that each entity has
been working to make trans-

portation more convenient and
efficient throughout Ann Arbor.
The Fuller Road transit station
is especially necessary, Kosteva
said, because the city's popula-
tion is expected to rise, which
will increase the need for alter-
native transportation methods.
However, some city officials,
including Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil members Mike Anglin (D-
Ward 5) and Stephen Kunselman
(D-Ward 3), aren't convinced the
transit station is the most effec-
tive addition to the city.
Anglin said he doesn't support
the execution of the plan, which
he said wasn't "well-construct-
ed." Building a new train sta-

tion isn't what the city currently
needs, he said, and the funds for
the station have yet to be secured.
Kunselman also said he's
hesitant to support the project
because of funding. The city
has failed to "identify all of the
funding sources for the parking
garage," he said.
Instead of the transit station,
Anglin said he would like to see
the city buy new buses.
To have a "healthy university,
you have to have a healthy city,"
Anglin said. But this project is "a
parking structure for the Univer-
sity," rather than the city, he said.
Kunselman said he doesn't
want the Fuller Road transit sta-

tion to be passed by City Council
in its current state.
"In theory (the parking struc-
ture) is nice, but in practicality
there's a significant number of
questions and concerns," he said.
There are more pressingissues
throughout Ann Arbor that the
city should attend to first, Kun-
selman said.
"(The project) doesn't fit into
the reality of today," Kunselman
said, adding that he doesn't think
there is a need for a commuter
rail.
"We can call it a transit cen-
ter, but it's really just a parking
lot with a bus stop," Kunselman
said.

'M' seeking offensive
spark against RedHawks

Defenseman turned
forward Vaughan
excelling on
offensive end
By CASANDRA PAGNI
Daily Sports Writer
While the ninth-ranked Wol-
verines have gone 5-2-0 since
securing their 14th Great Lakes
Invitational
Championship - NOTEBOOK
in late Decem-
ber, Michigan coach Red Beren-
son is far from satisfied.
Both of Michigan's losses in
2011 have come at the hands of
Michigan State, which currently
sits at 10th place in the CCHA.
After dropping Saturday night's
contest, 2'1, to the Spartans,
Berenson said the team needed
"more players overachieving"
offensively.
"We want to get our team
going," Berenson said after
practice on Monday. "We want
to have four lines that can play
against the opponents' top lines if
it comes to that. We're still look-
ing for chemistry and combina-
tions on lines. Nothing is in stone.
"(Senior forwards Carl Hage-
lin and Matt Rust) are not in
stone - I mean not when Rust
has got one goal in the last fif-
teen games or more. Carl has
scored two five-on-five goals in
the last 10 games, but that's not
enough for a top player like him.
You never stop looking at your
team."
Hagelin and Rust have been
anchors of the Michigan offense
for much of their careers, as the
duo has played on the same line
in 115 of their 157 games that
have taken place while they've

been Wolverines.
The pair played on the same
line early this week in practice,
but in a push for more produc-
tion from his forwards, Beren-
son has shaken up the lines to
spark certain players.
Sophomore forwards Kevin
Lynch and Chris Brown
switched lines, with Lynch now
playing with Rust and Hagelin
and Brown playing next to soph-
omore forward A.J. Treais and
freshman forward Luke Moffatt.
Noting that the "puck luck"
present earlier this season-might
be running out for his Wolver-
ines, Berenson said the team
needs to create more quality
scoring opportunities each game
- and capitalize on them from
now on.
"We were going through a
stretch where I kept saying,
'We're not playing that well, but
we're getting puck luck,"' Beren-
son said. "Maybe the other night
we didn't get the puck luck, but
we still weren't playing thatwell.
We generated maybe five or six
really good chances, and Luke
Glendening got five of them, and
he just couldn't score."
Heading into a weekend series
with No. 13 Miami (Ohio) in
Oxford, the Wolverines know
they'll need to score more than
one goal each night to have the
best chance at earning six points
out of the two contests.
SCOOTER KEEPS SCORING:
Senior forward Scooter Vaughan
spent the majority of his career
as a defenseman - including his
first two seasons as a Wolverine.
But after switching to power
forward at the start of his junior
year, Vaughan now embraces
the role in front of him and has
strived to make his senior season
count.
"I think I will always think

like a defenseman," Vaughan
said. "Growing up (with) so
many years of my life playing
defense, I think that will stick
(with) me the rest of the way. But
I think as the games go on, I'm
getting more confident with the
puck.
"In practice, I'm more confi-
dent, I'm doing some things (to)
get more patient with (the puck).
I feel good offensively, butI need
to pick it up in the defensive zone
a little bit. I'll probably always
think like a defenseman but just
have offensive tendencies."
With an assist on senior for-
ward Louie Caporusso's goal
this past Saturday - the only
tally for Michigan in that game
- Vaughan tied his career high
for assists in a single season with
five.
In addition to his five helpers,
Vaughan already has nine goals
to his name this season - and
there are still eight regular sea-
son games left.
Vaughan even scored the first
game-winning goal of his career
against Alaska two weekends
ago.
"It's nice to contribute offen-
sively," Vaughan said. "I'm a
power forward - my strengths
are defensively. But when I can
put some offensive production as
well, that's only going to help my
cause. It feels good to contribute
to the team, to put the pucks, in
net has been nice."
NOTES: With such a tight race
at the top of the CCHA - just
five points separate Notre Dame,
Michigan, and Miami - Beren-
son insisted earlier this week
that he is trying to keep Michi-
gan from "scoreboard watching."
Berenson said he is involved in
the polls, but doesn't even look at
the PairWise comparison ratings
until the season is over.

Michigan coach John Beilein anid the Wolverines will have second crack at knocking off the Buckeyes on Thursday night.
Michiganlooks to hand
No.stI Ohio State firs loss

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Editor
The last time a team went
undefeated and won the NCAA
Division-I college basketball
championship was in 1976,
when the Indiana Hoosiers
capped a perfect 32-0 season
with a win over the Michigan
men's basketball team.
That was 35 years ago. But
with tonight's game against No.
1 Ohio State, Michigan has the
opportunity to, in a way, avenge
that loss from so long ago.
The Buckeyes (9-0 Big Ten,
22-0 overall) haven't been shy
about their intentions on adding
a National Championship to the
team's resume by the end of the
season. But for now, Ohio State
coach Thad Matta is just try-
ing to keep things as simple as
possible - focusing on what his
team needs to do to play better
basketball.
And after the Buckeyes' last
game against Northwestern -
in which Ohio State narrowly
scraped by in a 58-57 win -
Matta began looking at how his
squad could improve against
a young Michigan team that is
coming off two huge wins in
conference play.
While the Wolverines (3-6,
13-9) were able to take down
the Spartans in East Lansing,
they head into similar territory
at Value City Arena - where
the Buckeyes haven't lost in
almost a year.
The Wolverines split their
regular season series with
the Buckeyes last year, with
each team winning at home.
But this year, Ohio State may
be more skilled than last
year.
"I've never seen a team
that shoots so well and also

has such an inside presence,
it's just rare that you see that,"
Michigan coach John Beilein.
said Monday. "Even if you can
mark up on one guy and do
something in the post, but when
you have four shooters shooting
over 40 percent (from range) in
Big Ten play - the best defen-
sive league in the country - it's
just hard."
When the Wolverines lost
to the Buckeyes, 68-64, in Ann
Arbor early last month, Ohio
State's spot-on 3-point shoot-
ing was in full effect as the team
shot 50 percent from behind the
arc.
Since starting conference
play, the Buckeyes have gotten
even better - three players are
in the top 10 in 3-point shooting
in the Big Ten.
Unlike Ohio State, which
thrives from beyond the arc,
Michigan has spent most of the
season living or dying by the
3-point shot.
When the Wolverines are
feeling it and shooting nearly 50
percent from behind the 3-point
line, they haveupset teams like
Michigan State and made Iowa
look mismatched against the
young Michigan squad. But,
when the Wolverines shoot
around 30 percent, like they did
against Minnesota and Indiana,
they've lost games they had the
potential to win.
Like Matta, Beilein is also

keeping it simple for his young
team - stressing the impor-
tance of his team's ability to
move on after a disappointing
play or game.
"It will paralyze you," Beilein
explained. "When you're not
having a good game and you
keep thinking about it."
The game marks the Wol-
verines' second cluster of the
Big Ten slate - four games in
nine days. Michigan competed
in its first cluster in early Janu-
ary, starting with its matchup
against then-No. 3 Kansas. The
Wolverines were unable to col-
lect a win in that tough four-
game stretch.
But now, with the team
knowing what to expect, the
Wolverines hope to improve on
thoirlast showing in such close
games - all are rematches with
teams that beat Michigan ear-
lier this season.
"I think the second time
around they know a little bit
more what to expect, but so do
the other teams," Beilein said.
"So that will be the thing that
we have to continue to pound
into (the players) - that each
game is separate. If you win on
the road and they come to (Ann
Arbor), you better be ready.
"And if they beat you at their
place, you owe them one at your
home place. You have to be
ready because they are too -
they're trying to sweep you."

Big Ten-leading Nittany Lions visit
Crisler with first place on the line

000000

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
It was hard not to feel optimis-
tic for the Michigan women's bas-
ketball team after it beat then-No.
24 Ohio State on the road - a vic-
tory that marked the program's
first regular-season sweep of its
rival. The Wolverines were riding
a four-game winning streak and
were expected to roll over lowly
Minnesota to set up a showdown
for first place with Penn State on
Thursday.
In the Big Ten, though, any-
* thing can happen. Instead of
entering the game against the
Nittany Lions with a five-game
winning streak, Michigan will
play first-place Penn State after
coming off a dishearteningloss to
the Golden Gophers.
"I told these guys at the begin-
ning of the year, 'You'll be lucky

to win one Big Ten road game,'
and at this point right now, you'll
be lucky to win another one,"
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth
said after the Ohio State game.
"I don't think anybody is that
much better than anybody else,
or that there is that big of a sepa-
rator where you can't come in one
night and not show up with your
best effort."
Luckily for Michigan (6-3 Big
Ten, 13-8 overall), it has played its
best basketball at home. The Wol-
verines are 8-3 at Crisler Arena
this season, including 3-1 in the
Big Ten. They also average close
to 10 points more at home than
on the road. They will need that
offense against the Nittany Lions,
who are leading the Big Ten with
over 80 points per game, good for
12th best in the country.
In a lot of ways, Michigan and
Penn State (7-2 Big Ten, 18-5

overall) are similar teams. Both
rely on their 3-point shooting for
a majority of their offense, which
they try to set up by forcing
turnovers. The only problem for
the Wolverines, though, is how
proficiently Penn State is able to
execute the keys to its game plan.
The Nittany Lions lead the
nation in 3-point percentage at
a ludicrous 45.1 percent. That
number is close to three points
higher than any other team in the
country - a scary thought for the
Wolverines, who have repeatedly
been burnt from deep this season.
Penn State is led by freshman
extraordinaire Maggie Lucas,
who is averaging 16.4 points per
game, while shooting more than
47 percent from downtown.
The Nittany Lions also feature
three players who average more
than 10 points per game, and
two others who average nine per

game.
Penn State also leads the Big
Ten in steals, averaging close
to 11 per game. Though this is a
major part of its game, it may not
be a big issue for the Wolverines.
Michigan gives the ball away
just 13 times per game, which is
No.2 in the country. The Wolver-
ines also have the best turnover
margin in the conference at +3.5,
which will be important against
a Penn State team that is built
defensively around forcing turn-
overs.
Against Ohio State, Michigan
shot almost 46 percent on 3-point
attempts, including close to 67
percent in the first half. It forced
18 turnovers, and made big shots
when needed.
In order for the Wolverines to
beat another highly touted team,
they will need to execute much of
the same gameplan.

Hoke talks first recruiting class Barnett could make
By TIM ROHANimpact as freshman
Daily Sports Editor

Tony Posada didn't want to be
that guy.
The 6-foot-4, 330-pound
offensive lineman from Tampa,
Fla. chose Michigan before coach
Brady Hoke took over and didn't
want to be left out in the midst of
the upheaval of Michigan foot-
ball. Schemes were changing.
Coaches were changing.
"I was scared about that,"
Posada said on WTKA radio on
Wednesday. "(I was) worrying if
I was one of their guys."
As it turns out, Hoke went to
visit Posada, to convince him to
stay committed to Michigan.
Posada, as well as, Chris Bry-
ant - who's also 6-foot-4, 330
pounds - are exactly the kinds of
plaWL isokis looking for as he
switches to the pro-style offense.
"You got to have those guys
up front who are going to come
off the football and those guys
that are going to knock guys off
the ball," Hoke said. "(Bryant
and Posada) fit the mold of what
Michigan offensive linemen are
going to look like."
Hoke joked that he looked
smll compared to Posada and
referred to Bryant as a "refrigera-
tor withlegs and arms."
The two linemen were two of
20 recruits who committed to
come to Michigan on Wednesday,
NationalSigniig Day.
Hoke's first recruiting class,
which was ranked No. 21 nation-
allybyRivals.com, came together
just three weeks after he was
hired.
In fact, the class wasn't even
finalized when the press confer-
ence started. More than 20 min-
utes into the press conference,
Associate Athletic Director Dave
Ablauf informed Hoke on a slip
of paper that four-star tight end
Chris Barnett was also commit-
ting to Michigan..
For the Wolverines, it was one
position of urgency to address
for the recruiting class of 2011 -
with just two tight ends remain-
ing on scholarship.
And it was clear across the
board that Hoke and his staff
wanted to address key areas of
concey wi the players: that
they signed. u
"It took some time to see
where we were and what kind
of football team we want to be,"
Hoke said.
That meant signing play-
ers like Bryant and Posada who
dominate opponents at the point
of attack.
And don't forget helping one of
the worst defenses in the country.
Hoke signed five defensive
backs, including four-star recruit
Raymon Taylor, who, as Hoke as
said, can "line somebody up and

MAISSAMCCLAIN/Daily
Michigan coach Brady Hoke annvunced on Wednesday that the Wolverines will run a 4-3 defensive scheme next season.

go through the middle of them,
like you're supposed to play the
game."
Michigan also signed four
linebackers, including multiple
players who can go sideline-to-
sideline, like Antonio Poole and
Frank Clark.
And three defensive ends com-
mitted to the Wolverines, includ-
ing four-star recruit Brennan
Beyer who was praised for his
toughness at the point of attack.
What do they all of the defend-
ers have in common? In a word
- physicality. These newcomers
may not be five-star recruits, but
Hoke highlighted the defensive
backs and linebackers as groups
that could have players with
opportunities to make an impact
as freshmen this fall.
"There is no entitlement in
this program," Hoke said. "When
you recruit guys, I've never told
a guy he's going to be redshirted
and I've never told a guy that,
'You're going to play as a fresh-
man.' There's always going to
be opportunities ... I think there
are guys (in this recruiting class)
with opportunities."
Twelve defensive players in
all were signed to play the 4-3
defense, which Hoke announced
would be the Wolverines' base
defense in 2011.
"That's something that we
both have been familiar with,"
Hoke said of his and defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison's
experience with the 4-3. "We're

a little seasoned. We've coached
a lot ... I think it's a great fit for
what we want to do."
The kicking game was also a
high priority after the Wolver-
ines converted just 4-of-14 field
goal attempts in the 2010 season.
Hoke convinced a San Diego
native, Matt Wile, who Hoke was
previously recruiting to go to San
Diego State, to commit to Michi-
gan.
Michigan tight ends and spe-
cial teams coach Dan Ferrigno
said the right-footed kicker could
connect from 50-plus yards and
recorded a 90-percent touchback
rate on kickoffs in high school,
albeit 10-yards closer than where
he'll kick from at Michigan.
For good measure, the Wolver-
ines grabbed commitments from
running backs Thomas Rawls
and Justice Hayes. During an
interview on WTKA on Wednes-
day, Hayes envisioned a future
with Rawls pounding defenses up
the middle while he works more
on the perimeter.
"The one thing about taking
running backs, most of the time
they're the best athlete on their
high school- team, that's why
they're back there," Hoke said,
adding that it's easy to move run-
ning backs to other positions.
Of the 20 members of the class,
13 come from Michigan or Ohio.
Hoke said that he and his staff are
goingto focus on lockingup play-
ers in the state of Michigan first,
before branching out to Ohio and

Illinois, Indiana and Western
Pennsylvania.
The staff had to scramble to
lock up the class that was com-
prised roughly one-half of players
initially recruited by Rich Rodri-
guez and one-half generated by
Hoke and his staff. But after the
whirlwind stopped, the Wolver-
ines were left with a haul that is
more than respectable, consider-
ing the circumstances.
"Our goal was to get guys who
were going to represent Michi-
gan and Michigan football,"
Hoke said. "Guys who obviously
fit the mold from an academic
standpoint, fit the mold from a
character standpoint and fit the
mold for what we wanted to see.
"I don't know if we thought it
was going to be more difficult. I
think when you are Michigan,
when you are at Michigan, you
have an awful lot to talk about....
For us, you're just going to work
and try to see what's best for
Michigan."
NOTES: Hoke said the paper-
work for Devin Gardner's medi-
cal redshirt has been filed ...
Michigan offensive coordinator
Al Borges looked at 15 quarter-
backs before deciding on quarter-
back-commit Russell Bellomy ...
By Monday, Hoke says he plans to
finalize his coaching staff, which
is still missing defensive line and
defensive back coaches ... Defen-
sive back Greg Brown is the only
commit enrolled early for the
Winter 2011 semester.

AMER'S
530 South State
The best thing about the salad at Amer's
is the delicious, chewy hunk of bread that
comes with the meal, balanced precari-
ously on the plate of leafy lettuce, crunchy
cucumbers and tasty tomatoes. Though
there isn't technically a Caesar salad on the
menu (youhave to order the "Grilled Chick-
en Salad" with Caesar dressing in order to
reproduce the classic), the added carbs take
the health food a step above brilliance.
NOODLES & COMPANY
320 South State
Noodles & Company's Caesar salad
boasts an impressive variety of leafy, ten-
der greens, yet there are too many watery
white chunks of romaine left on the plate
at the end of the meal. The dressing is a
perfect balance of salty and sour flavors
with a subtle hint of anchovies. Unfortu-
nately, though, the grilled chicken is bland
- it just seems to be thrown on top as an
afterthought.

PANERA BREAD
777 North University
There's something about Panera that
makes every University student just have
to stop there in the minute before class
starts. But it's clearly not the Caesar salad.
Drowning in dressing and plagued by a
faint, out-of-place taste of bacon, this salad
would never pass an emperor's muster. The
only redeeming quality is that it comes
with a rich piece oftbread or an apple - but
that's hardly any consolation.
QUIZNOS
Inside Pierpont Commons
Featuring generous shavings of parm,
peppercorn-infused Caesar dressing and
bite-sized pieces of chicken nestled under
warm flatbread, the Quiznos Caesar salad
is a taste sensation. The lettuce is fresh,
crunchy and provides a good balance for
the other flavors. Be careful though: It's
pretty garlicky and comes with onions -
don't forget mints if you plan to be around
other people.

Dear Mary Sue,
This isn't over.

Dear "The Social Network,"
I'm CEO, bitch.

that came out around the release
of "BGII," like "The Legend of
Zelda: Majora's Mask," are enjoy-
able, but have vacuous characters.
The "Final Fantasy" games, while
appreciated for their deep story-
lines and fleshed-out characters,
had linear stories that allowed for
little deviation. In "BGII," charac-
ters band and disband, progress
and even die. Events aren't always
scripted, and the player usually
has multiple options when com-
pleting quests.
There is a decreasing sense
of open-endedness in modern
games, but "D&D"-based games
stay open-ended. "Final Fantasy
XIII" and "Metal Gear Solid
4" took a narrative style that is
closer to film, as it subjects the
player to a story. "BGII," true to
its "D&D" origins, lets players

explore their own stories. There
are scripted conversations and
events, but the way they are han-
dled and the results of circum-
stances vary based on decisions
made and the composition of the
player's party.
It's strange that as time has
progressed, the length and depth
of games have diminished. Even
though "Baldur's Gate II" came
out 10 years ago, it shows the
potential all video games have.
BioWare is still carrying the
torch with its continuously com-
plex games, and it no doubt keeps
"BGII" in mind when makingnew
ones. Hopefully other companies
will take note of BioWare's adher-
ence to quality; they would do
well to keep in mind the origins
of RPGs and their perfect realiza-
tion in "Baldur's Gate II."

For the glory of the games

Departmentally
challenged

'Smash Bros.' and
'StarCraft' unite in
competition
By SHIN HIEFTJE
Daily Arts Writer
Though most members of the
student body might not be aware
of them, two devoted, tightly
knit video game communities
exist in the far corners of cam-
pus. These underground groups
don't advertise at Festifall - one
isn't even officially recognized
by the University as an organiza-
tion. Yet, because of the competi-
tive appeal of the games, both
groups have gained members
and formed passionate commu-
nities through word of mouth
and online promotion. They are
the Smash League and the Star-
Craft Team.
Though their numbers might
be small, both groups at the Uni-
versity are part of a larger video
game scene, both regionally and
nationally.
The brotherhood of "Smash"
As TVs roll into the room, peo-
ple do as well, happily greeting
each other with GameCubes and
controllers in hand. Players yell
to each other about impressive
combos or recoveries. This is the
Thursday night scene on the third
floor of Mason Hall, where a local
"Smashfest" is being held in one
of the classrooms. Smashfests are
organized "Super Smash Bros."
events that regularly happen on
campus. Players compete in both
"Super Smash Bros. Brawl" and
"Super Smash Bros. Melee," two
different versions of the game.
Both involve pitting famous Nin-
tendo characters against each
other in combat.
Since it's long after class
hours, no room reservations
need to be made and TVs can be
wheeled in from almost every
room on the floor.
"It's almost as if Mason Hall
was built for this," said Engineer-
ing sophomore Robin Harn, one
of the club's main organizers.
While it's obvious that every-

Smashfests take place on the third floor of Mason Hall.

one in the room is very skilled
and serious about their play,
there's a very genial atmosphere
as well. It feels vibrant - chit-
chat is everywhere, and every-
one's eyes are focused on the
screens. By 10 p.m., more than
20 people have shown up for this
traditionally four-person game.
Not all are even students at the
University - a few of them have
come all the way from East Lan-
sing and Southfield.
Ann Arbor is a hub in the state
of Michigan for those who love
competitive "Smash Bros."
"The entire Michigan (video
game) community grew out of
Ann Arbor," said LSA senior
Jason Bowyer, who was, here
when the competitive "Smash
Bros." scene took off in 2007.
The players are here to have
fun, but many of them are also
here to hone their skills to
become more competitive for
larger tournaments. There are
regional tournaments for money
prizes in Chicago and Ann Arbor,
and larger ones in places like
New Jersey. As recently as two
weeks ago, part of Michigan's
Smash League traveled to Kansas
to compete ina tournament.
"I've traveled out of state over
30 times," Bowyer said. "You'll

see tournaments that are giving
out four to five grand for first
place."
Though Bowyer has never
won that much, he says he won
$900 at one of the tournaments
he attended.
Most of these gatherings,
whether local Smashfests or
national tournaments, are orga-
nized through Smashboards.com
- the primary website regarding
"Super Smash Bros." play.
When asked why the game
is so compelling competitively,
players said that both a desire to
improve their technique and the
inclusive nature of the scene is
what drew them in.
"There's no ceiling to 'Smash'
- you can keep getting better
and better," Harn said.
LSA sophomore Brian
Northrup, one of the other main
organizers, said he plays from an
aspiration to be the best.
"(However), the community
aspect of it is really what's kept
me here," Northrup said.
Despite its popularity among
select students, the "Smash"
community at the University is
fairly nebulous. Smashfests can
often be impromptu, and some
people have fallen away from the
scene while others have joined.
"(The group) has become
a little more hardcore, so not
as many older guys come,"
Northrup said. "But we've kept a
number of people; we've gained
a lot more."
World of "StarCraft"
A more structured and sub-
dued scene can be witnessed on
Saturday nights at the computer
labs in the Michigan League,
where the University's StarCraft
Team meets to play. They play
"StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty,"
an in-depth real-time strategy
game, in which players work to
tactically produce and manage
armed forces successfully in
order to defeat their opponent's
armed forces.
With about eight or so people
showing up in the labs to com-
pete, it may not look like the
University StarCraft Team has
much going on, but in reality,
they are part of something mas-
sive. The team is part of the Col-
legiate StarLeague - a league
that consists of 144 colleges

across the continent, each with
its own "StarCraft" team. This
league is separated into divisions
of 18 teams each. Each team in
the division plays the other 17
online in a round-robin fash-
ion each week, and at the end of
the 17-week season, the top four
teams in each division move on
to a bracket-style playoffs.
Two weeks ago, the Univer-
sity's team played the University
of North Carolina. Games are
structured so that the first team
to win three matches wins the
game. Michigan pulled a victory
in the fifth.
Engineering junior Tianyi Liu
is the coordinator of the Star-
Craft Team. He decides which
out of the 50 members play on
which days and communicates
with other teams about any
issues. He says he found out
about the Collegiate StarLeague
while browsing Teamliquid.
net, a website that functions for
"StarCraft II" much like how
Smashboards.com functions for
"Super Smash Bros."
"Anyone who's anyone who
plays 'StarCraft' goes on Team-
liquid.net," he said.
Liu and his friends decided
to form a team for the Univer-
sity once they found out about
the Collegiate StarLeague. After
posting about the team on Team-
Liquid.net, it took off.
Though there are' 50 players
on the team, not all of them have
to show up. Liu said the team is
more of an online community
than an in-person community.
"StarCraft II" is played on PCs,
so connection to players across
the world is usually smooth and
there's no need to travel like
there is in "Super Smash Bros."
Also, "StarCraft II" is a very
graphics-intensive game, so
many players like to play from
their rooms where they may
have a better computer.
However, the StarCraft Team
is still a community, and it's
clear that friends and acquain-
tances have been made on the
team. Of the eight members who
showed up to the computer labs
when only two were there to
actually compete - the rest were
there to watch their teammates
play. Players moved their fingers
across the keyboard at unbeliev-
able speeds, inputting hundreds

in wide-legged khaki pants and
a sweater with a picture of an
animal on it.
Yes, that's right - for much
of my prepubescent years, my
fashion sense was a combina-
tion of Bret from "Flight of the
Conchords" on top and military-
inspired getup on the bottom. But
"Conchords" didn't existback in
Y2K, and military (while all the
rage last fall) simply wasn't in
vogue in fifth grade. My frill-less,
pink-free clothing, combined
with a constantly messy mop-top
haircut, made a clear statement
to the world: I dressed like aboy.
It's not that strange of a phe-
nomenon, really - I have plenty
of friends who used to cut their
hair short and favored sneakers
peering out from jeans to little-
girl flats beneath frilly skirts. In
the celebrity realm, Angelina
Jolie and Brad Pitt's daughter
Shiloh has caught plenty of
attention from paparazzi and
gossipmongers for her hoodie-
and striped shirt-dominated
"personal style" (or however one
would label the wardrobe prefer-
ences of a three-year-old) and
last summer's tabloids proudly
proclaimed that "Shiloh wants to
be a boy!"
At any rate, my own (tabloid-
free) childhood fashion sense
went relatively unnoticed as I
grew up. I encountered minimal
teasing, and eventually I came
to like floral patterns better than
grinning cheetah faces on my
shirts. The only real difficulty
duringthis phase was shopping:
Despite my obvious leaning
against girly clothing, I was loath
to leave the "Girls" section of the
department store.
My insistence on this front
made shoppingtrips with my
mother insufferable. I would
pore over racks and racks of girls'
t-shirts looking for the baggiest,
most formless ones. My mom
would point across the store to
where the "Boys" sign heralded
hordes of Tommy Hilfiger under-
shirts and plain, collared polos,

and I would stomp my foot in
opposition. There would be no
confusion: I did not wantto be a
boy. I did not want to be a girly-
girl. I was, and took the utmost
pride in saying it, a tomboy.
Despite its lack of department
store signage, there's clearly a
place for androgyny in today's
fashion world: Ultra-skinny
supermodels certainly don't look
feminine, but they're definitively
women. Pantsuit-clad female
talk show hosts and fictional
characters running the gamut
from Annie Hall to Peppermint
Patty all dress on some midpoint
along the infinitely distinguish-
able spectrum of male and female
dress. Nobody's sayingthat the
"Men," "Women," "Boys" and
"Girls" (and, oddly, "Juniors")
Macy's method of sorting is obso-
lete, butI think it's-worth noting
that this has never really been
how things work.
Conchords, fig
leaves and me.
Think about it. In ancient
times, both men and women
covered their privates with loin-
cloths - in some cultures, people
still do. And while I'm sure there
are differences in style and color,
it's nothing like the thongs-and-
boxers strata we see today. Heck,
when Adam and Eve first broke
out the fig leaves after the Tree of
Knowledge fiasco, theyset a noble
precedent for gender-blind cloth-
ing. (Though granted, depending
on which Renaissance painter you
trust, I guess the pair could have
styledtheir eco-friendly garb in a
sex-specific way.)
Ramses and Cleopatra alike
dutifully dabbed on dark eyeliner
for a mysterious and royal look in
ancient Egypt. Scotsmen tradi-
tionally don kilts, which original-
ly signified their clan according
to the specific plaid pattern and
which were worn sans under-
pants, purportedly to be more
sanitary. Kimonos are sported by
both men and women in Japan,
though by neither often anymore.
The French - well, we say a lot of
things about the French and style
and gender, but we'll leave them
out of it for now.
Nowadays, boy hipsters can
strut skinny jeans, grunge girls
can flaunt flannel and I have
no reason to be ashamed of my
10-year-old fashion sense (not that
I would be - I was awesome), but
it would be wrong to assume this
is a modern innovation.

Almost famous on YouTube

By PROMA KHOSLA
Daily TV/New Media Editor
On a cool August evening in
East London, hundreds of people
crowd into the Ice Father Nation
pub to celebrate the curious fan
community of YouTube.
Let's back up a bit. This "curi-
ous fan community" can be
traced back to 2007, the year that
brothers John and Hank Green
gave up textual communication
in favor of video blogs for 365
days. Several thousand subscrib-
ers later, they had spawned a fan
community called the Nerdfight-
ers. As these fans began making
their own YouTube videos, they
found different niches in the
community.
That brings us to the likes of
Alex Day (YouTube username
nerimon) and Charlie McDon-

nell (charlieissocoollike). As of
January, Charlie is the most sub-
scribed YouTuber in the United
Kingdom. In 2010, he, Alex, Tom
Milsom (hexachordal) and Ed
Blann (Eddplant) formed the
band Sons of Admirals - one
of many groups spawned by the
Nerdfighter community. On this
night, they were hosting a con-
cert and a book reading by John
Green.
So where do I fit into this?
Well, I consider myself to be fair-
ly familiar with the concept of
fandom. I'm a huge "Harry Pot-
ter" fan - I check the websites,
listen to wizard rock, go to con-
ventions ... you name it. I went to
this Ice Father Nation event with
friends I'd met at "Harry Potter"
conferences, so if there's anyone
who knows what fandom can do
for people, it's me.

From Page 3B
the same occurrences are a sta-
ple of events among the "Pot-
ter" fandom. But what struck me
was that for the first time, I was
removed from the fan interac-
tion, watching the events from
an outsider's perspective. And
from that perspective, it was
some pretty weird shit.
Tom and I were nonplussed
by the attention we got. Though
unrecognizable to the hundreds
of people packed into the pub,
we were presumably famous
enough to be selling CDs and
chatting with John. We were
treated differently by virtue of
this implied eminence.
One fan mistook me for a
famous YouTuber; another took

a picture of me, Tom and Lex
selling merch. Some talked to
us, about everything from the
University's StarKid to John's
books to puppy-sized elephants.
I was mistaken for someone
who was someone, a celebrity in
my own right just for knowing
the event's hosts. In the days
that followed, I'd find pictures
of John tagged in my Facebook
feed with my face in the back-
ground.
What sets Nerdfighters apart
from other fan groups is this:
Only in the age of YouTube
could people like John, Hank,
Charlie, Alex, Tom, Ed, Rosi and
Lex become celebrities. They're
not athletes, actors or models ...
they're just a bunch of nerds who
make videos for us. The purpose
of vlogging is to help users talk
about their interests. Making

them "Internet-famous" was
just a side effect.
I couldn't help wondering: Do
my "Harry Potter" friends and
I look like this to other people?
Does being a fan of someone
from the Internet really appear
this crazy?
The answer is yes. I spent
my own time hero-worshiping
people from "Harry Potter"
bands and websites, if only to
grow out of it and just enjoy the
show. People call it many things:
fangirling, idolatry ... but it's the
same thing we experience daily
with "real" celebrities, a phe-
nomenon we learned about in
Comm. 102 called "pararelation-
ships."
Basically, the human brain
isn't designed to get to know
people through a screen - be
that a movie screen, television or

computer. We develop a one-sid-
ed relationship with the people
in those screens without them
ever knowing a thing about us.
What's unique about YouTube is
that the celebrities are ordinary
people who never bargained for
fame. It's bizarre.
With that in mind, the rest
of my surreal experience at Ice
Father Nation doesn't seem so
strange. Even though my friends
and I still struggle to put the
night into words, I can't imagine
it going any differently. In fact,
all the singing, selling, signing
and being mistaken for someone
who's YouTube-famous seems
normal. This is the new era of
celebrity. Don't judge the new
medium and fan culture. If this
is our generation's way of fur-
thering entertainment, then so
be it.

"My goal for the team is not
just to win, but to have as many
play as possible," Liu said.

The gaming communities
at Michigan may be under the
radar, but both strive to be as
inclusive as possible. Though
it's clear all the players in these
groups are talented and deter-
mined gamers, both communi-
ties enjoy the social aspect just
as much. They come for the
competition, but they stay for

Since its popularity was born
online, it would make sense for
the majority of StarKid's fan-
base and fan interaction to exist
online as well. Group members
often receive an unmanageable
amount of Facebook messages,
friend requests, photos, online
fan art and fan-created websites
honoring both them as people
and their onstage personas.
Many of the actors have also
received fan fiction stories writ-
ten about the characters they
play - and sometimes even
based on their fans' perception
of them as people.
The messages Richter receives
exceed the typical adoration and
appreciation for his work. A few
messages have even have shown
concern for his well-being.
"I got an e-mail once of some-
one telling me that they thought
I was going to die," Richter said.
"They had a dream or had some
way of knowing that something
bad was going to happen so they
kind of said, 'Be careful when
you're driving on ice,' or what-
not. That was the weirdest one I

received."
Last summer Richter and a
few other of his co-workers went
to the Infinitus convention in
Orlando, Fla., a large "Harry
Potter" gathering for fans of the
series.
"The conference was amaz-
ing," he said. "We witnessed
mass fandom all around us. We
signed autographs, got inter-
viewed - it was a blast. We
had a line that was practically
wrapped around the corner of
the convention center and lasted
for two straight hours."
StarKid productions aren't the
only popular YouTube videos
started by University students.
Just as "Harry Potter" was one
of the main inspirations for the
StarKids, for the G-Men it was
"The Lion King."
Back in Dec. 2007, the G-Men
uploaded a live performance of
their a cappella version of the
"Lion King Medley."
All clad in blue jerseys and
jeans in the video, the members
bring to life the well known
songs "Circle of Life," "I Just
Can't Wait to be King" and

"Hakuna Matata" as they occa-
sionally act like the beloved ani-
mal characters.
This video, along with a few
others done by the group, is now
at roughly 200,000 hits. As in
the case with the "Very Potter"
musicals, networking sites aided
in its spread.
LSA senior Chaz Cox said he
realized just how popular "The
Lion King" video had become
when his boss at his summer
internship found it and shared it
with the entire company.
Though the group posts vid-
eos of its performances after
every live show, the ones that
have received the most praise
and attention are the 2007 "The
Lion King" medley, its Nick-
elodeon medley, which was
recorded the same year and has
roughly 180,000 hits currently;
and a "Billie Jean" cover, which
was recorded the following year
and now has approximately
250,000 hits.
"When it first started hap-
pening, a cappella, though not
necessarily a new thing ... was
becoming more mainstream and
something that people were see-
ing on YouTube more," Cox said.
"It's a very interesting art form,
so going to YouTube and look-
ing for a cappella videos initially
is what sparked interest in those
videos."
Somehow, though, interest in
the videos exploded from there.
Nowadays, people who watch
videos like the "Lion King Med-
ley" are introduced to the world
of a cappella through YouTube
videos, instead of discovering
the videos through a prior pas-
sion for their subjects.
Team StarKid reiterates this
idea.
Though its musicals were
originally marketed toward
"Harry Potter" followers, fans of
the production company's other
musicals found themselves grav-
itating toward the "Very Pot-
ter" series as well, uniting these
two unlikely audiences into one
definitive fan base.
But that's the virtue of viral-
ity: It can unite completely dif-
ferent demographics together.
Wrapped up in the web
Going beyond live perfor-
mances that started on campus
and flourished on the internet,
LSA senior Danny Lysz has pro-
duced, sketched or been part of
hundreds of videos on YouTube
through a variety of partnerships.
Many of the videos he's
worked on are parodies - like an
alternative take on an Axe com-
mercial and a spoof of "Man v.
Wild."
The Axe video features Lysz
putting deodorant on in the mir-
ror - but instead of being bom-
barded with skimpily dressed
women, like in the original com-
mercial, he finds himself sur-
rounded by a few shirtless men.
Lysz described the video as one
that draws on the anything-goes
mentality of college, as he acted
out the mannerisms he portrays
in it.
Though he doesn't give much
thought to the actual people
watching videos he's worked on,
Lysz is fascinated by how many
people around the world have
seen his work..

His creativity and never-end-
ing supply of material have led
him to the creation of his new
company, University Studios.
The company is planning to offi-
cially launch at the University
this semester and later expand to
other Big Ten schools.
The biggest problem in the
media world is attaining some
form of representation to get you
through the door - it's some-

thing that usually takes many
connections to achieve. Lysz's
company aims to solve that
problem by giving University
students the all-access pass to
entertainment representation
through viral video fame.
People who want to get this
representation have to first
upload their video to Lysz's web-r
site and have it approved by him
and his team.
"We don't want to be a You-
Tube," Lysz said. "We don't want
to be something where there
is such a magnitude of crap up
there that you can't find anything
worthwhile. Our goal is to have'
a smaller amount of videos, but
only for people that are gearing
towards being in the business."
The Internet provides a lim-
itless medium for ideas and
thoughts, and it's only growing
with each passing day and next
big thing. Lysz thinks his site
could be next.
"The Internet is usingtwo per-
cent of its potential right now,"
he said. "We have all this ability
to link things together and we're
just not doing it. (My website)
could be one of the first steps to
really understanding that. It's
bridging the whole nation and
even the whole world together."
Having access to the Internet
truly makes a small world even
smaller, connecting you to peo-
ple you'd probably never meet
walking the streets of Ann Arbor.
Rackham student Ben Saunders
was connected through Twitter
to thousands of Netherlanders
who believed him to be a beloved
pop star from their version of
"American Idol."
Every Friday, Saunders
received more and more Twit-
ters followers, as his name-twin
grew in popularity on the reality
show. Once people in the Nether-
lands started to realize Saunders
was not the pop sensation they
thought him to be, things got
even more complicated for him.
"A lot of random people start-
ed complaining that I was pre-
tending to be this guy," he said.
"They said I was trying to get
some of his Twitter fame, which
is sort of silly, since all my posts
are in English, and it's a label on
my account that I am an Ameri-
can student - not a reality show
singer."
So, who's the real Ben Saun-
ders? The semi-famous Neth-
erlander covered in tattoos and
clad in glasses and hats, or the
brunette and brown-eyed gradu-
ate student you might see walk-
ing around campus?
Saunders even received Inter-
net messages from the rising star

about his frustration over the
situation.
"Which is crazy because he has
many thousands of followers and
I had a couple hundred," Saun
ders said. "I don't think he has
anything to worry about. Whe
is the official person though? Os?
his Twitter he has the 'official
Ben Saunders,' which is strange
because I have that name toOp
Who gets the claim of some offi-
cial status on the Internet?" '-
Viral fame can give a plat
form to people with a voice and
opinion dying to be heard. Uni-
versity alum Lauren Herskovic
who graduated in 2006, created
such a space - College Candy;
an online lifestyle magazine
especially designed for college
women. Besides Herskovic, there
are two writers for the website
who currently attend the Uni-
versity.
Before the website started
up, there was a pronounced gap
between magazines for the love-
sick teen and the city-dwelling,
career-driven woman. There
was Seventeen - with a large
appeal to high school students
- and Cosmo - with a large
appeal to working women. But
what about the women caught
in between? There seemed to be
a void when it came to college-
specific concerns, like finals,
dorm life, senior year, sex and
relationships.
"We want girls who are stu
dents," she said. "That's what
makes College Candy differ-
ent. We're not some 40-year-old
women who haven't been in col-
lege for 20 years. We have girls
who are living it. Their problems
are your problems, and what
you're learning, they're learn
ing."
To get your voice heard a
mere 10 years ago, you had to
have a way into the media - a
close connection to the celeb-
rity world. Now, with the vast-
ness of the Internet, as long as
people are willing to find a space
to speak, they will find an audi-
ence for it.
"Alotofpeoplethinkthemedia
and written word is dying," Her-
skovic said. "But there's infinite
space online. It used to be an elite
group of people that could voice
their opinions via magazines and
newspapers. Now, if you know
what you're doing and you say it
well, you can be successful. It's
really inspiring."
So, what's the next big thing
to peruse through or chat about
during boring lectures? As long
as you have a bit of luck and just
the right elements, it could easily
be something you created.
