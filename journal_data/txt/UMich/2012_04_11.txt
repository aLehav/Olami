'U' experts say
Romney is now
presumptive GOP
nominee
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily Staff Reporter
Former Pennsylvania Sen.
Rick Santorum ended his bid
for the Republican presidential
nomination yesterday, announc-
ing the suspension of his cam-
paign with a primary contest in
his home state looming on April
24.
Santorum's withdrawal,
which he attributed to the ill-
ness of his young daughter, clears
the path to the nomination for
frontrunner Mitt Romney, who
already had a substantial advan-
tage in the Republican delegate
count. With Rep. Ron Paul (R-
Texas) and former Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich as his only
remaining opponents, University
experts said in interviews yester-
day that Romney can now focus

on November's general election.
In a brief speech in Gettys-
burg, Pa., Santorumsaidhis cam-
paign had been avictory, striking
the same self-assured tone he
held after his wins and losses in
the Republican primary contests.
"Against all odds, we won 11
states, mil-
lions of vot-
ers, millions
of votes," he
said in his
speech.
Romney
released a statement yesterday
congratulating Santorum on the
success of his campaign and hail-
ing him as "an important voice"
in the GOP. At a campaign event
in Wilmington, Del., the former
Massachusetts governor said he
was optimistic about his chances
for the Republican nomination
and looked forward to the gen-
eral election.
"this has been a good day fdf
me," Romney said at the event.
Santorum was the longest
lasting Republican candidate
challenging Romney, after win-

150 gather to decry
alleged hate crime
at rally

Yesterday the unexpected
snow flurries did little to sup-
press the University's activist

spirit, as more than 150 Univer-
sity students and community
members joined together for
the student-led Million Hoodie
March last night.
The march was held in honor
of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed
Florida teenager whose Febru-
ary killing was allegedly racially
motivated. The marchers began
at the Trotter Multicultural
Center on Washtenaw Avenue

before ending at the Diag. More
than 50 people arrived about
an hour before the official start
time to create signs for the
march, while watchingthe ABC
News coverage of the possible
indictment of George Zimmer-
man, the man who killed Mar-
tin as he walked through a Fla.
neighborhood wearing a hoodie
and carrying a bag of skittles
and an Arizona iced tea.

Other volunteers who arrived
early helped some of the attend-
ees register to vote. LSA junior
Patrick Parkinson, a member
of Wolverines for Diversity - a
coalition of student groups that
organized the march - said reg-
istering students to vote was one
of the main goals of the event.
"We're really pushing for
long-term change," Parkinson

GRADUATE STUDENT EMPLOYEES
MERC motion
pauses union bid

In 2-1 decision,
discussion on
unionization tabled
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily News Editor
The Michigan Employment
Relations Commission has once
again abandoned the question
of whether graduate student
research assistants should be
able to form a union.
In its meeting yesterday,
MERC voted 2-1 to step away
from the issue of GSRA union-
ization, at least until action is
taken by another government
body, according to Ruthanne
Okun, director of the Michigan
Bureau of Employment Rela-
tions.
"They're waiting to see what
the Legislature or the courts do
and I anticipate that one or the
other is going to do something,
so that will probably result in
commission action," Okun said.
In light of Monday's deci-
sion by the Michigan Court
of Appeals to grant the House
Republicans' motion to stay,
the injunction prohibiting the
immediate effect of House Bill
4246 was nullified. Specifically,
this means GSRAs are currently
not classified as public employ-
ees in the state and thus unable
to obtain collective bargaining
rights.
Since it's a pending case, Okun
said MERC will have to meet

again to discuss GSRA union-
ization, though the body could
determine that it does not have
appropriate jurisdiction.
She said that it's likely the
GSRA issue will reach MERC's
desk again within a few months,
and noted that today's motion to
table the matter was predictable.
She also said MERC stands firm
in not taking a position on the
issue.
"The commission does not
want to take an ideological
position. They take positions
on cases that are before them,"
Okun said.
Rackham student Stephen
Raiman, founder of Students
Against GSRA Unionization.
said he believes MERC did the
right thing by abandoning the
GSRA issue until further action
is taken.
"We're happy about that,"
Raiman said. "We feel that's
the right decision. We're glad
that this state government has
decided to stay out of our affairs
and let us go about the business
of being graduate students free
from state influence and free
from outside influence."
Okun said even though the
decision was not unanimous,
it was an obvious one. She said
MERC chair Edward Callaghan,
who voted against the motion,
was probablyin favor of bringing
a permanent end to the GSRA
issue in MERC, rather than a
temporary one, which is why she
said he voted the way he did.

vigilance in
preventing
larcenies
Officials say theft is
up 32 percent this
academic year
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily Staff Reporter
For some students, larceny
costs a few dollars and the has-
sle of cancelled credit cards. Foi
another student, who was careful
to take his laptop and cell phone
with him as he briefly left his
seat at a library, a whole semes-
ter's worth of work disappeared
as a thief made off with the hard
drive away tucked in his back-
pack.
In a security bulletin e-mailed
to the University community yes-
terday, the University's Depart-
mentofPublic Safetyencouraged
vigilance on the part of students
as the semester winds down in
order to prevent larceny. The bul,
letin stated that the University
has faced a 32 percent increase
in the number of larcenies com-
pared to last year, with 190 so far
this academic year.
In an extended version of the
bulletin posted on the Depart-
ment's website, Interim DPS

Students discuss
affirmative action,
building use at
fireside chat
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily StaffReporter
At a cozy affair yesterday,
University President Mary
Sue Coleman and E. Royster
Harper, the University's vice
president for student affairs,
answered questions from a
few dozen students during a
fireside chat in the Michigan
Union.
The fireside chat, a month-
ly tradition for Coleman and

Harper, aims to connect the
upper administrators with a
cross-section of students from
across the University's schools,
colleges and disciplines. Dur-
ing yesterday's meeting, stu-
dents discussed implementing
a medical amnesty policy at the
University, utilization of space
and buildings for student orga-
nizations, affirmative action
policy and an upcoming con-
ference on outer space.
Pharmacy student Eric
Zhao, a Central Student Gov-
ernment representative, asked
Coleman and Harper about
their position on medical
amnesty in light of a recent
resolution passed by CSG. Spe-
cifically, the resolution would
call for the implementation of

a medical amnesty policy that
would exempt students from
receiving Minor in Possession
ofAlcohol citations when help-
ing another student in medical
danger from alcohol or other
substances.
"What we hear from stu-
dents is a reluctance (to help
their friends) if it's going to get
them in trouble," Harper said
to the students. "My own feel-
ing is that it's a good thing and
I think you should do it even if
you get in trouble."
Harper added that she hopes
law enforcement officials
would use discretion when cit-
ing MIPs, especially in situa-
tions when students took the
risk to help one another.

Chongqing party secretary Bo Xilai attends the closing session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in
Beijing's Great Hall of the People, China.
Top Chinese politician ousted
as his wife is accused of murder

After gaining
a nationwide
following, Xilai
sees career end
BEIJING (AP) - A flamboyant
and telegenic politician who until
recently seemed destined for the
top ranks of China's leadership
was stripped of his most power-
ful posts yesterday and his wife
named in the murder of a British
businessman as Chinese leaders
moved to stem a scandal that has
exposed divisive infighting.
The announcement that Bo
Xilai was being suspended from
the Communist Party's Politburo
and Central Committee and that
his wife was a suspect in a homi-
cide investigation put an end to a
colorful political career. Media-
savvy with a populist flair, Bo
gained a nationwide following
for busting organized crime and
for reviving communist culture
while running the inland mega-
city of Chongqing..

His publicity-seeking ways
angered some in the top leader-
ship, however. In recent weeks,
allegations of Bo's and his family's
misdeeds leaked into public view,
threatening to complicate prepa-
rations by the leadership for a
delicate, once-a-decade transition
to younger leaders at a congress
later this year.
"This -means the political
career of Bo Xilai is over," said
Cheng Li, a Chinese politics
expert at the Brookings Institu-
tion in Washington. "The party
wants to really resolve the Bo
Xilai crisis in a relatively short
periodoftime. Theywantto make
sure that the attention for the 18th
party congress will not suffer too
much from the Bo Xilai episode."
Bo's patrons included retired
party elders who retain influence
over senior appointments, and
among his vocal supporters were
influential generals and party
members, scholars and ordinary
Chinese who identify themselves
as leftists. His removal raises
questions about whether Chi-
nese leaders will have to make

concessions to them to achieve
the political balance that has
restrained factional fighting in
recent decades.
"A political succession that
seemed completely predictable
has been upended," said June
Teufel Dreyer, a China politics
expert at University of Miami.
"We may be in for more surpris-
es."
An editorial to run today in
the party's People's Daily news-
paper appealed for unity and said
the investigation into Bo's viola-
tions would show the leadership's
"solid resolve in safeguarding
party discipline and the rule of
law."
Yesterday's announcement,
carried by state media, provided
details of what has been a lurid
and embarrassing scandal for the
leadership.
Bo's removal from top govern-
ment posts came on suspicion of
involvement in unspecified but
"serious discipline violations,"the
Central Committee said, and his
case was handed over to internal
party investigators.

Michigan district
to get emergency
manager
Gov. Rick Snyder has deter-
mined a financial emergency
exists in the Muskegon Heights
public school district, clearing
the way for the appointment of
an emergency manager.
Snyder made his announce-
ment yesterday after recommen-
dations from astate reviewteam,
which early this month suggest-
ed the move.
The recommendation had
been expected. The Muskegon
Heights review process started
after the district's school board
O voted in December to seek an
emergency manager.

Zimmerman's
lawyers withdraw
from shooting case
The Trayvon Martin case took
a bizarre turn yesterday when
George Zimmerman's attorneys
quit, complaining that they have
lost all contact with him and that
" he called the prosecutor and talk-
ed to a TV host after they told him
not to speak to anyone.
The lawyers portrayed the for-
mer neighborhood watch captain
as erratic and his mental state as
shaky, and they expressed fear for
his health under the pressure that
has been building in the month
since he shot and killed Martin, an
unarmed black teenager.
"As of the last couple days he
has not returned phone calls, text
messages or emails," attorney
Craig Sonner said at a news con-
ference outside the courthouse.
"He's gone on his own. I'm not
sure what he's doing or who he's
talking to. I cannot go forward
speaking to the public about
George Zimmerman and this case
as representing him because I've
lost contact with him."

" Texas spends
settlement funds
on conservation
Texas is the first state to con-
firm a deal to use settlement
money from the Gulf oil spill for
a coastal conservation project,
paying $2 million for 80 acres of
crucial habitat for endangered
whooping cranes.
The state worked with a pri-
vate nonprofit to quickly buy land
using some of the approximately
$6.5 million it got from MOEX
Offshore 2007 LLC, a minor-
ity partner in the ill-fated rig that
blew up in 2010, killing 11 people
and causing the worst offshore
spill in U.S. history.
The plan is for MOEX to give
$2 million to the Texas Nature
Conservancy to buy the land

and donate it to Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department. The private
nonprofit signed the contract yes-

Syria launches
attacks despite
cease-fire plan
Syriantroops defieda U.N.-bro-
kered cease-fire plan yesterday,
launching fresh attacks on rebel-
lious areas, but special envoy Kofi
Annan said there was still time to
salvage a truce that he described
as the only chance for peace.
More than a year into the Syr-
ian uprising, the international
community has nearly run out
of options for halting the slide
toward civil war. Yesterday,
Annan insisted his peace initia-
tive remains "very much alive" -
in part because there is no viable
alternative.
The U.N. has ruled out any mili-
tary intervention of the type that
helped bring down Libya's Moam-
mar Gadhafi, and several rounds
of sanctions and other attempts
to isolate President Bashar Assad
have done little to stop the blood-
shed.

COLEMAN
From Page 1A
Coleman said one of the com-
ponents of the current MIP pro-
gram is to track repeat offenders
to determine who is at serious
risk for addiction or abuse of
drugs or alcohol.
"If you take away that abil-
ity to identify somebody, are
you really in the long run doing
a disservice?" Coleman asked. "I
think there are unintended con-
sequences."
One recurring topic addressed
by several questioners was diver-
sity at the University. Business
graduate student Kendra Jack-
son asked how the University
could attract minority students
specifically to the Business
School after the passage of Pro-
posal 2 in 2006, which outlawed
the use of affirmative action in
the admissions process.
Coleman said despite the ini-
tial drop in applications from
minorities after the proposal's
passage, the University has made
progress in increasing applica-
tions and acceptances for minor-
ity students, but it hasn't been

able to translate those accep-
tances into actual matriculation.
"Our acceptances keep going
up," Coleman said. "The prob-
lem is in the conversion, get-
ting students to accept us ... If
you don't have the applications,
you're kind of stuck. We've got
the applications, we've got the
admittances, now we have to do
the conversions and we need to
do better than we're doing."
Coleman also called for stu-
dent input on how to improve the
enrollment of minority students
in the University as a whole.
Another student mentioned
potentially relocatingthe Trotter
Multicultural Center to a loca-
tion closer to Central Campus to
foster greater participation, not-
ing its proximity to fraternities
on Washtenaw Avenue at times
leads to discomfort, particularly
among female students.
"I thinkthat this issue of space
and a multicultural center closer
in itself isn't a bad idea," Harper
said. "But it's a continual strug-
gle around space and priorities
and what gets put in the space."
Coleman added that a new
space for student organizations
at the University could poten-

tially be fostered through exten-
sive renovation of the Michigan
Union and the Michigan League.
The last renovation to the build-
ings, Coleman said, was more
than 60 years ago.
Coleman and Harper also
heard from Engineering junior
Galen Kreutzberg about an
upcoming symposium on outer
space that will be the "Wood-
stock of space conferences,"
according to Kreutzberg.
Kreutzberg spoke about the
student-driven conference, slat-
ed to be held in August 2013, to
celebrate the history of space
exploration and the University's
long-standing relationship to
NASA.
After the session, Kreutzberg
said Coleman had extended the
University's support in the devel-
opment of the conference and its
promotion.
"They said they would help
us get sponsors and connect us
with people and really get the
University behind this," Kreutz-
berg said. "This is the true spirit
of Michigan coming through. We
really want to lead the country
into the (next phase) of space
exploration."


MARTIN
From Page 1A
said. "Just reminding the people,
'Hey, your vote matters, voting
is important to get these laws
repealed or adjusted' ... Actual
action, that's what we're trying
to promote."
Rackham student Vanessa
Cruz said the march was planned
to raise awareness about a law
in Michigan similar to Florida's
Stand Your Ground law-which
allows people feeling threatened
to protect themselves with force,
including using a gun, without
trying to get away first - and
may allow Zimmerman to walk
away unpunished. Cruz said
laws such as the Stand Your
Ground law are the root of insti-
tutional social injustice across
the nation.
"We just want to drive home
the point that the life of some-
body of color is not worth less
than that of anyone else," Cruz
said. "The justice systems in our
states should provide the proper
system for those people ... who
hold racial stereotypes to pay
their sentences."
Rackham student Davin Phoe-
nix, who also helped organize the
event, discussed Michigan's law
in more detail with a group of stu-
dents and community members
before the march began.
"Our voices will be raised in
protest," Phoenix told the crowd.
"We will have our eyes wide open
... to recognize that these trag-
edies can happen in our very own
community."
After a few brief statements

reminding the attendees that the
march was a nonviolent protest
and police would be on standby
to help anyone who might poten-
tially feel threatened, the group
began the nearly 45 minute
march to the Diag at 7:17 p.m., the
same time Martin's body was dis-
covered by police.
Amid shouts of "What do
we want? Justice! When do we
want it? Now!" and various other
chants, the crowd marched from
Washtenaw Avenue to South Uni-
versity Avenue, then made its way
down to State Street before cross-
ing over to North University Ave-
nue, picking up stray pedestrians
along the way. The march finally
ended at the steps of the Hatcher
Graduate Library at about 8 p.m.
Some of the marchers lit
candles while others took to a
megaphone, sharing personal
stories of injustice. LSA freshman
Daniel Morales shared his past
status as an undocumented citi-
zen and encouraged the crowd
to get involved in making lasting
change.
"I think we stand for justice for
all, regardless of race, gender ... or
immigrant status," Morales told
the crowd. "We all deserve to be
treated as human beings."
Morales added: "It is not just a
race issue ... or a religious issue.
It's a human issue."
Phoenix took to the stage once
more, emphasizing the need
for people to continue to make
strides toward fighting injustice.
"This right here does not con-
stitute a threat," Phoenix said
as he flipped up the hood on his
sweatshirt. "Get to know me.
Make every effort to join into the

struggle ... every day that we are
alive, we need to make a differ-
ence."
LSA senior Alex Ocampo, a
member of the Wolverines for
Diversity, encouraged the crowd
to attend the University's Board
of Regents meeting next Thurs-
day, where the coalition is plan-
ning to continue its fight against
social injustice at the University.
"We're going to demand
increased enrollment of under-
represented minority students,"
Ocampo said toa cheering crowd.
"We're going to request mandato-
ry IGR classes to improve campus
climate surrounding race."
Ocampo also mentioned that
allowing undocumented students
living in Michigan to pay in-state
tuition was another goal the
coalition planned to tackle at the
regents meeting.
After the speaking died down,
Ocampo and the other coalition
members passed out chalk to
the crowd, asking attendees to
write across the Diag what they
planned to do to ensure that the
event positive impacts.
LSA junior Luz Meza said she
attended the march to stand in
solidarity with other University
students and to make her voice
heard.
"It's just not fair for anyone
that this can happen in our coun-
try, and that our government can
be OK with it," Meza said. "We
need to be showing that we care
about it and that Wolverines
will always stand up for justice
and for what's right, and not just
ignore these things that racial-
ize our country and that divide
us."

Raiman said he expects the
Court of Appeals to rule that the
bill banning GSRA unionization
is legal.
"I'm confident that the court
will eventually rule in our favor,
that they will find the law that
was passed to be constitutional
and perfectly proper, so I don't
believe that MERC will feel the
need to convene about this issue
again," Raiman said.

ning the Republican primaries
in Colorado, Minnesota and Mis-
souri before closely losing Rom-
ney's home state of Michigan.
The fact that neither of Rom-
ney's two remaining challengers,
Gingrich and Paul, were particu-
larly successful in the Repub-
lican primaries nearly assures
Romney of the nomination, said
communications Prof. Michael
Traugott.
"It's all over," Traugott said of
the race for the Republican nom-
ination. "It was heading towards
being all over anyway, but now
there's no effective opposition to
Romney. He is the presumptive
nominee."
Gingrich, who won the South
Carolina primary in January,
vowed yesterday to remain in the
race despite victories only there
and his home state of Georgia.
Traugott said Gingrich stood
little chance of topping Rom-
ney, but that the former House
Speaker's presence in the elec-
tion could compel Romney to
keep pandering to the Republi-
can Party's far right wing.
If that is the outcome of Gin-
grich's campaign, Traugott pre-
dicted trouble for Romney in the
general election.
"(Romney's) doubly cursed,"
Traugott said. "He may not be
conservative enough to people
on the far right, yet he's become
so much more conservative that
it could be a concern for moder-
ates in the Republican Party."
However, LSA junior Brian
Koziara, senior adviser to the
University's chapter of the Col-
lege Republicans, said Romney
would be well-equipped to shift
his focus to Obama because he's
already been in "general election

"It's not surprising that they
would (pass the motion tabling
the GSRA issue), given that the
law preventing GSRAs from
organizing is technically still in
immediate effect because a stay
has been put on the restraining
order," Rodrigues said.
She added that she is dis-
appointed with the decision
because it represents another
obstruction to GSRAs voting to
unionize, but is optimistic that
the House Democrats' lawsuit
could ultimately help GEO's
cause.
"We were heartened that the
lawsuit brought to attention the
fact that the way that the bill
was passed was troubling with
its speed and lack of respect
for democratic procedure,"
Rodrigues said.
mode."
"One of Mitt Romney's
strengths is that he's been focus-
ing on the general election the
whole time through," Koziara
said. "That's one of the reasons
that people see him as electable.
He's been able to focus a clear,
concise and accurate message
about President Obama."
Koziara also said he disagreed
with the notion that Republi-
can voters may be turned off by
Romney's perceived espousal of
more conservative policies dur-
ing the primary season. He said
he thought Republicans recog-
nize that their task in this fall's
general election will be to defeat
Obama, not to argue over the
merits of their own candidate.
"At the end of the day, Rom-
ney has a very fiscally conser-
vative, pro-jobs, pro-economic
message," he said. "That reso-
nates with Republican voters. At
the end of the day, jobs and the
economy are not Republican
issues, they're not conservative
issues - they're issues where
it's all about who is best to make
these things happen."
For the University's chapter
of College Republicans, Koziara
was unsure whether the orga-
nization will start pushing for
support on campus now that
Romney is the definitive candi-
date.
Still, he said many members of
the College Republicans already
supported Romney, and eve
those who didn't expected Rom-
ney to ultimately be the candi'
date in the general election.
"People have come to terms
already with the fact that he's
the likely nominee," Koziar
said. "I think it's important that
we understand that we under,
stand that we need to get behind
one single individual, and that's
Mitt Romney."

increase in larceny reports in
2012," Piersante said in the bul-
letin. "We have made a number
of arrests of career criminals
who have targeted our commu-
nity. But we still have predators
around."
E. Royster Harper, the Uni-
versity's vice president for stu-
dent affairs, said the University
is taking steps to promote stu-
dent awareness and security,
particularly in residence halls.
She added that the University
is also considering adding secu-
rity cameras on Central Campus
to deter crimes.
"There's been conversations
about more cameras," Harper
said. "What we're trying to
find (is) that balance between
this being an easy place to be
and being safe. You don't want
so many cameras that you feel
watched an invaded upon, but
you don't want so few that they
don't help with the deterrent."
Harper added that extra vigi-
lance during the final days of the
semester is especially impor-
tant.
"It's easy around final time
to get lax," Harper said. "There
are some bad people who prey
on students, and they know our
rhythm better than we do."
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said most larcenies occur
outside of residence halls where
students leave items unattended
for brief periods of time, noting
that break-ins and home inva-
sions are comparatively more

rare than larcenies. Some of
the items reported as stolen in
the security bulletin were later
recovered, according to Brown,
but returns are rare.
"All of the residence halls
have cameras at all of their
entrances and exits, which has
been a significant deterrent
and also has assisted in solving
some crimes," Brown said. "It is
notable in locations where cam-
eras do exist that theyhave often
been helpful in quickly solving
crimes, particularly larcenies."
Brown added that DPS has
continued a dialogue with Uni-
versity administrators about
installing cameras in areas with
higher incident rates. A commit-
tee within the University has
been looking to formulate a uni-
form policy for camera systems
across campus, but those guide-
lines are not developed.
According to Brown, most
crimes are not committed by
University students but rather
by outside "predators."
"People do need to secure
their laptops, and their back-
packs, and their wallets in par-
ticular," Brown said. "These are
the things thieves are target-
ing."
However, groups such as the
University chapter of the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union take a
skeptical view of the use of cam-
eras in public space in deterring
crime.
Public Policy senior Bennett
Stein, ACLU and Ann Arbor Pri-
vacy board member, said add-
ing more cameras on campus is
"ill advised" and ineffective at
reducing crime.

"As we continue to move for-
ward with our technologies,
we need to consider what these
technologies are doing to our
fundamental liberties and fun-
damental rights," Stein said.
Stein cited the right to pri-
vacy, even in public spaces, as
a primary concern for both
groups.
"My experience has been that
DPS is concerned with solv-
ing crime and promoting pub-
lic safety," Stein said. "But we
would hope that now and in the
future they're engaging us more
in the discussion of howthey can
protect civil liberties as well."
LSA sophomore Ellen Steele,
outgoing chair of the Univer-
sity's chapter of the ACLU and
a member of the DPS Oversight
Committee, said the group gen-
erally opposes the use of cam-
eras and sees them as an undue
infringement upon the rights of
citizens.
"We in Ann Arbor have sup-
ported an effort to create an
oversight committee to oversee
the use of security cameras in
public spaces," Steele said. "We
would support an effort like that
on campus."
However, Steele said the
efforts to reach out to the Uni-
versity community through
education and crime alerts were
a progressive step for DPS.
"I think it's good to have
transparency with the police
department," Steele said.
Steele was not able to com-
ment on discussions within
the DPS Oversight Committee
because the issues are bound by
confidentiality.

Stressing over schedules
The University must update Wolverine Access
T he University has a wide array of computer-based offerings,
from informatics and computer science in LSA to comput-
er engineering in the School of Engineering. These majors
instruct students to speak and code the language of computers, a skill
that's highly sought after in the current job market. Complex comput-
er skills, however, shouldn't be necessary when registering for classes
prior to each semester. Unfortunately for the majority of students,
the stress of selecting classes is multiplied by the complexity of Wol-
verine Access. The University should streamline and modernize its
entire course guide and registration process by remodeling Wolverine
Access to save students time and trouble.

Games" movie was released,

In early April, those returning to the Uni-
versity for the fall semester began registration
after having added potential courses to their
"backpack." Wolverine Access and schools'
individual course listings are housed on sepa-
rate websites. Students browse courses, and
then add them individually to their backpack
for registration at an appointment time that's
determined based on total credit hours.
The current system is an apparent relic of
the early days of the Internet. The separation
of course listings from Wolverine Access pro-
vides a needless complication to the scheduling
process. Instead of simply clicking on a class
to backpack it, the course number must be
entered into Wolverine Access and confirmed.
Besides creating frivolous steps in an already
frustrating process, the separation misses
opportunities to help students select the best
schedule available.
There would be numerous advantages to
combining the two systems. The course guide
should take into account previously complet-
ed courses along with courses in a student's
backpack. A smarter course guide could flag
these previously taken or already backpacked
courses, so students can pass over them more
easily. Even more useful, it could flag courses
that don't conflict with previously backpacked
classes. This way, students could first add
courses with the least flexibility due to require-
ments or classes only offered on one occasion.
Then, when browsing, there will be less time

wasted looking at classes that coincide with
courses that students want to take more.
If the two were combined, students could
potentially use advanced searching tools to
more easily select classes. Advanced course
searches should take several factors into
account: students' graduation requirements,
previously completed courses and scheduling
conflicts. More specific searches would expert-
ly narrow down the overwhelming selection,
and translate which courses are especially per-
tinent to completing a concentration.
Individual aspects of Wolverine Access and
course guides should also become more user-
friendly. Wolverine Access currently only
displays a "calendar view" of classes upon reg-
istration, instead of logically during backpack-
ing as well. In the course guide, sections of the
same level courses sometimes are totally dif-
ferent classes. Separating these further would
lead to less confusion and greater interest in
each class. Simple measures like these may
seem frivolous, but peeling back each unneces-
sary layer of complication will lead to a more
efficient process.
With finals on the horizon, registration
occurs during an already stressful time for
students. Picking courses is an important deci-
sion and should be done carefully. The system
in place, however, detracts from the end goal.
The University has the meansto simplify it and
help students more efficiently select the best
schedule possible.

the death using kids from those
districts as contestants. Another
recent event was Easter, which
was celebrated last Sunday and is a
holiday where Christians of many
denominations celebrate the resur-
rection of their savior Jesus Christ.
These two events may appear to
have little in common, but, after
some reflection, I believe that
Collins' message in "The Hun-
ger Games" and some of Jesus'
teachings complement each other.
Though I'm a nonbeliever, I'd like
to think that I live life with values
that adhere to some Biblical teach-
ings, even if I don't do so because
of religious doctrine. And, because
the messages from the two books
have some parallels, "The Hunger
Games" resonated with me like
very few books had before. Let's
take a look at how Collins and Jesus
work together.
Any reasonable reading of the
Bible reveals that God and Jesus
repeatedly call for society to take
care of its poorest members (note:
the GOP seems to skip all these
parts). One example: Deuteronomy
15:7. "If there is a poor man among
you ... you shall not harden your
heart ... but you shall freely open
your hand to him and generously
lend him sufficient for his need in

whatever he lacks." In fact, God
sometimes condemns the rich, as
in Luke 6:24, "But woe to you who
are rich, for you are receiving your
comfort in full."
In "The Hunger Games," we get
to examine a society where the
richest and most powerful people
are selfish, arrogant and unwilling
to help those who have the least.
One look at the pretentiousness and
excess of the Capitol makes us sick
because we see the rest of Panem
struggling to make ends meet.oWe
react viscerally to the Capitol's
fundamentally wrong relationship
with its districts. If the people in
the Capitol followed Jesus' instruc-
tions to take care of the less for-
tunate in Panem, the country's
citizens would be undeniably better
off.
So, both books advocate for soci-
ety taking care of those with the
least. And with that point in mind,
let's go a little further - you could
reasonably expect that Jesus would
agree with this slight extrapola-
tion of his message: We should be
sensitive to the suffering of others.
After all, how are the powerful sup-
posed to help the weak if they don't
sympathize with the plight of those
barely scraping by?
Collins conveys this message
powerfully with her depiction of
"The Hunger Games." When we
hear Capitol officials utter the now-
infamous phrase "May the odds
be ever in your favor," we realize
that the brutal deaths of innocent
kids are a game to them. The gar-
ish appearances of Capitol residents
during the Games compared to the
modest dress of Panem citizens fur-
ther illustrate the disconnectedness
of the Capitol. But the insensitivity
to suffering would be tolerable if it
existed only in fiction - Collins is
actually taking a shot at us.
The United States is a country

where wars are increasingly fought
by a small portion of the population
that is quite detached from the rest
of the citizenry, and some statistics
show that many who join the mili-
tary are economically disadvan-
taged - they enlist because they
feel it's their only ticket to a better
life. In this way, citizens "use" the
less fortunate to fight their wars
while they get to stay home without
In both, the rich

making any sacrifices. And, because
the wars are mostly being fought
overseas and because of the devel-
opment of the 24-hour news cycle,
Americans are largely oblivious or
numb to the burdens shouldered
for us by soldiers and their families.
This callous Capitol-like country
is one that Jesus would certainly
criticize.
As you celebrate Easter and go
crazy for "The Hunger Games,"
take a moment to reflect on the
teachings of Jesus and warnings
from Suzanne Collins. Pope John
Paul II once said: "A society will be
judged on the basis of how it treats
its weakest members." As soon-to-
be Michigan alumni, many of us
will eventually be powerful people.
We'll have the responsibility of pro-
viding for the less fortunate. And,
regardless of political or religious
affiliation, this responsibility is one
that we should take seriously. Let's
live up to it.

Why go through the motions?

When it comes to the Middle East, question
everything. Question quarter sheets handed
to you on the Diag, question "facts," question
sources, question motives, question opportu-
nities - especially missed opportunities like
Palestine Awareness Week, which had such
amazing potential to share the rich culture of
a people too often ignored. Question how the
chance to share the traditions, not the trag-
edies, of a people so frequently used as pawns
was spoiled by turning it into a page out of the
anti-Zionist playbook; how the rare occasion
to get people to acknowledge the humanity of
the Palestinian people, not the sheer numbers,
was thrown away by talking about "occupa-
tion" on Palestinian Cultural Day. That dis-
course propagates the belief that Palestinian
culture is defined by its opposition to Israelis,
not by its history or traditions. Question how
an organization whose mission is to "bring
equality to all peoples" hands out FAQs that
use the words "Israel, Israeli, Jewish," or
'fZionist" 13 times, but "Palestine" or "Pales-
tinian" only 10 times. It uses the language of
"killed, forced, and demolished," as opposed
to talking about life, accomplishments, and
hope. Question the obsession with victimiza-
tion and hate.
Question single-mindedness. Question the
sincerity of a student organization whose
members claim to be "rights activists" with
a "moral obligation," but is so narrow in its
focus to only talk about financially destroying
Israel as the means to achieve peace. Question
a movement that in February, even the most
ardent of anti-Zionists called a cult. Ques-
tion the genuineness of MichiganBDS and its
inflammatory, inaccurate claims.
Question conversations without dialogue.

Question people who espouse rhetoric and
consistently fail to listen. Question one-liners,
buzz words and irrational claims. Question
the blame game, and those who try to make
their side out to be the greater victim. In the
end, the real victims on campus are those who
fail to challenge what they hear.
Question how educated people on this cam-
pus can be so vehemently against - or pas-
sionate about - the state of Israel. Ask them
why they feel the way that they do - and
understand the emotions inherent in the con-
flict, and the bias that goes with that. Question
how otherwise rational, intelligent people can
be dedicated to a cause so seemingly removed
from Ann Arbor. Question how events, groups
and viewpoints on the issue are suddenly
prominent features of the campus climate.
Question leaders on every level. Question
Ali Khamenei and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's
cries for Israel's destruction. Question why
Mahmoud Abbas - who has taken the most
public steps toward creating a Palestinian
state - has been stalled. Question why Ben-
jamin Netanyahu - and every Israeli leader
since 1948 - has been insistent on maintain-
ing secure borders for the Israeli people.
Question leaders on this campus who claim to
support one cause or another, and hold them
to their word.
Question your peers. Question people fly-
ering or tabling on the Diag. Question me.
Question yourself. Find the truth. Understand
that when it comes to conflict in the Middle
East, there is no single truth. But more than
anything, question those who fail to question
anything at all.

My grandmother - a Hungarian Holocaust survi-
vor - passed away on Nov. 18, 2011. Both of my pater-
nal grandparents went through Auschwitz. Growing
up, I was painfully aware that if it weren't for the
unspeakable torment they experienced, I never would
have been born. These stories were a personal family
matter, consequences of a mad history of genocidal
extermination and an ethical lesson that no human
being ought to suffer such atrocities in any place or
time.
My grandmother's struggle, however, was not only
the Holocaust. She was born into a poor family of 10
siblings in rural Hungary, and as an immigrant in the
United States, she raised seven children. My grand-
mother taught me lessons that fueled my progressive
political ethics. Her suffering was not primarily about
Jewish collective memory, but about class oppression
coupled with a specific history of genocide in which
Jews happened tobe the primary victims.
For this reason, last week, on April 2, I was appalled
to see the manner in which American Jews were com-
memorating the Holocaust on the Diag. I have always
felt alienated from the idea of a "Jewish collective
memory of victimization." American Jews should
learn about the Holocaust, but my impression from the
youngest age has been that too many assume this "col-
lective memory" as a badge of their own victimization.
As a grandson of Holocaust survivors, at an early age I
learned that the victims were my grandparents, ances-
tors and father, rather than me as a Jew. Focusing on
Jews' subjection to oppression throughout history flies
in the face of the affluence and racial privilege most
of us American Jews currently enjoy at the expense of
others.
One of the signs at the event displayed the oblivi-
ousness of American Jewish students to this privi-
lege. Dick Cheney shared his supposed wisdom on the
Holocaust: "We are reminded that such immense cru-
elty did not happen in a far-away, uncivilized corner

of the world, but rather in the very heart of the civi-
lized world." I approached the young woman at the
booth and pointed out the racism of dividing the world
into rungs of civilization. As a Latino Jew with South
American heritage, I was all too aware of this natural-
ization of the genocide of black and brown peoples as if
it formed part of a more generalized barbarism.
This dehumanization of non-European peoples is at
the heart of a global racist colonial project which in
turn, is situated in the heart of what Cheney calls "the
civilized world." The ideological barbarism of this
project existed prior to and after the Holocaust, and
even served as a justification for colonial genocides:
Germany almost wiped out the Herero and Namaqua
peoples between 1904 and 1907 in modern-day Namib-
ia, and King Leopold II's slave labor in the Congo
obliterated an enormous portion of the local popula-
tion. Yet the victims of these genocides were black; the
influence of colonialism on Germany's perpetration
of the Holocaust in Europe has not entered into pub-
lic discourse on the matter. The idyllic myth of Ger-
man civilization - one in which Gentile and Jewish
Germans alike participated in the early 20th century
- was blemished from the start. While the director of
Hillel graciously responded with interest to my e-mail
complaint about the sign, students showed consider-
ably less engagement.
For me, there are several questions to think about
when commemorating the Holocaust: Why go through
the motions each year if no new lessons are to be
learned? Why hold fast to a sense of victimization that
flies in the face of socioeconomic and racial realities in
our country and ignore the oppression of others? Why
uphold racism and colonial discourse when speak-
ing of the Holocaust? These are not the lessons that
one Holocaust survivor, my grandmother Adel Stern,
taught me throughout her life.

MT&D sophomore Conor
McGiffin, who plays Billy Flynn,
said that the characters' true
natures come forth in the songs.
"These are despicable people,
and you can hear it in the songs,"
McGiffin said. "There is back-
phrasing in the songs that would
not be in the revival. With back-
phrasing, you sing a little behind
the beat. This shows how there's
something a little off (with the
characters) and we don't know
what it is."
He added, "You want to think
that the bad guys will be put away
and the good guys will save the
world, but the good guys, the Billy
Flynns of the world, are creeps."
Even though the produc-
tion centers around the lives of
criminals and their ambition for
power and stardom, McGiffin
mentions that there is a lesson
that can be taken away from a
show like this.
"Not to steal anything from
'Transformers,' " McGiffin said.
"But there's more than meets the
eye to the beautiful people who
are put on trial, or who are in
trouble or who are public figures.
There is a lot more going on. We
should take what they have to say
or what they believe they stand
for with a grain of salt."

Sentimental reps. reflect
on past year at last meeting

CSG members discuss tuition
policy with U.S. Rep. Hansen

Assembly votes
against resolution
to use iClickers
during meetings
By GIACOMO BOLOGONA
Daily StaffReporter
The Central Student Govern-
ment assembly met last night
for its final meeting before the
newly elected representatives
take their seats next week.
At the end of every meet-
ing, representatives are given
the opportunity to address the
assembly. Typically, represen-
tatives discuss new initiatives
or resolutions, but this week,
several exiting members took
the opportunity to recount their
CSG careers, express their grati-
tude and even shed a few tears.
Business senior Matt Eral,
speaker of the assembly, led the
last meeting of his college career
before delivering his own speech
to the assembly.
"I think it was a great way to
end the first assembly," Eral said.
"I think everyone just reflected
on the year, thanked everyone

for an awesome experience."
Eral said the assembly had a
"phenomenal" year, discussing a
total of 64 resolutions.
"Throughout the course of the
year, we essentially 100 percent
redefined how that body oper-
ates from rules to votes to time
limits," Eral said. "We passed
budgets for $700,000 of stu-
dents' money, changed rules for
how we fund student (organiza-
tions), passed initiatives on their
behalf (and) ran big events."
The meeting, which mostly
tied up loose ends of the assem-
bly's term, had only one item of
new business - a resolution to
purchase iClickers for repre-
sentatives to use for voting and
attendance purposes.
Discussion of the resolution
took up the longest portion of the
assembly's meeting before being
closely voted down 10-9, with
two representatives abstaining.
Engineering junior Kyle
Summers, CSG chief of staff,
authored the resolution and said
the iClickers would help the
assembly run more efficiently.
The body was not convinced
that the expediency was worth
the cost to CSG.
"If we could get these things

for free, test it out, if that was a
possibility, then maybe it would
have been different," Summers
said.
Eral said this year also marks
the first of a new system of num-
bering the assemblies.
"It's the First Assembly
because it's the first assembly
under the new constitution,"
Eral said. "The previous year
was a transition year. So thiswas
an entire year operating under
the new constitution."
The Second Assembly will
be meeting for the first time
next Tuesday, and Eral said it's
important that they are asser-
tive.
"Student government some-
times doesn't have the best repu-
tation with students," Eral said.
"You just have to work through
that and do the work that you
know needs to be done and when
you do, it will show that you've
done a good job."
Looking at the year in review,
Eral said he will never forget his
time spent in the assembly.
"I'm going to miss my time
on the assembly and miss rep-
resenting students and being a
part of this organization every
Tuesday night," Eral said

Google + gathering
allows students to
discuss issues
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
DailyNewsEditor
Students from five universi-
ties met with U.S. Rep. Hansen
Clarke (D-Mich) yesterday, but
nobody had to travel far in order
to talk.
Through an online video-
chat facilitated by Google+, a
handful of University students
met in the Central Student Gov-
ernment offices with students
from Wayne State University,
Eastern Michigan University,
Western Michigan University
and Michigan State University
for a question and answer ses-
sion with Clarke about a bill he
recently introduced on college
affordability.
"It's a great way ... to com-
municate to each other about
the importance of the issue of
repaying student loan debt,"
Clarke said. "That's going to
help borrowers, their families,
and also too this bill is going to
help out the parents who have
taken out loans to help educate
their children."
The bill, called the Student
Loan Forgiveness Act, would
allow students that fit a set of
criteria to opt into a loan repay-
ment plan where they would
pay 10 percent of their annual
income to pay off student loans,
and after 10 years of payments
the remainder of the debt
would be forgiven.

"The federal debt is impor-
tant, we need to address that,
but let's address that in a long
term responsible way," Clarke
said. "But the real debt that's
really burdening people is the
debt that folks have to pay on
every month."
LSA junior Sean Walser,
chair of the CSG External Rela-
tions Commission, participated
in the video-chat and said the
issue of student loans is critical
to most University students.
"It's important to me person-
ally as I'm one of many students
here at this University with
quite a lot of student debt,"
Walser said. "Talking about
issues like this are important
because that really energizes
students to get out there and
make a difference."
LSA junior Aditya Sathi, vice
speaker of CSG, also attended
the event and lauded the impor-
tance of having open dialogues
with legislators in order to pro-
mote student issues.
"It's not every day that you
get an opportunity to have
some face time with a United
States congressman," Sathi
said.
Sathi previously worked as
an intern in Clarke's Detroit
office through a University
class in the fall 2011 semes-
ter. Sathi said this bill was not
an attempt to drum up sup-
port from student voters, but
a sincere call for student loan
reform.
He added that in the past,
Clarke has been open to meet-
ing with students and even gave
a speech to the South Asian

Awareness Network after the
group requested to speak with
him.
"It wasn't a campaign trip,"
Sathi said. "He wasn't going to
get any votes out of a major-
ity of these students because
they're not even in his district
... he generally just wanted to
come speak."
Sathi said CSG has no formal
position on this bill, and he said
he is still reviewing it himself.
Nonetheless, he said he's pleased
it's being discussed at all.
"I'm excited that somebody's
trying to do something about
student debt," Sathi said.
Walser, who helped plan a
Student Association of Michi-
gan rally against rising tuition
in Lansing two weeks ago, said
this issue expands beyond the
state.
"I think the next step imme-
diately is taking this piece
of legislation and breaking it
down and reading it and taking
it to the Association of Big Ten
Students, the Student Associa-
tion of Michigan," Walser said.
"(It's important to start) a dia-
logue about not only this legis-
lation but in general what the
federal government can do."
Walser said regardless of the
bill being passed, it's important
to find a solution to rising stu-
dent debt.
"Addressing these issues
(are) important," Walser said.
"Whether we do it with a spe-
cific policy or a different kind
of policy, I think we definitely
need to approach student debt,
student loan issues ... and col-
lege affordability in general."

What kept Michigan afloat was out of the bullpen.

Lakatos has been an asset as of
late. He's taken the mound in four
out of the last six games without
giving up a single earned run in
15 innings of work. Since the bat-
ting order couldn't make contact,
Winger's nearly perfect defensive
skills helped hold Bowling Green
to few runs. He made a jumping
catch to snag Falcon shortstop
Brandon Howard's line drive to
first base in the fifth inning.
Winger made the routine plays
and tallied the Wolverines' final
hit of the game with a single to the
pitcher but was tagged out at sec-
ond base on a fielder's choice.
Though his fielding is right on
target, Winger recently fell into a
slump at the plate. But he's confi-
dent that his swing is improving,
and he's focused on his approach,
trying to aim toward right field
and relaxing his hands.
Falcon pinch runner Alex Davi-
son scored the winning run in
the eighth inning due to another
second-base fielding error and
sacrifice bunt. Michigan needed
the same unlikely players to step
up like they did against the Spar-
tans. But after only one inning of
offensive work, there was no one
in the lineup with enough energy
to produce the same results.
"Our options are really lim-
ited," Maloney said. "We'll go out
there and see if we can play better
tomorrow."

Freshman threw 5.1
innings of five-hit
ball in Tuesday's
loss to Falcons
By STEVEN BRAID
Daily SportsWriter
The skies were gray, the tem-
peratures were cold, and snow
flurries fell from the sky, but
freshman right-hander James
Bourque felt none of that.
Despite the unfavorable
pitching conditions, Bourque
hurled a superb performance
in Michigan's 2-1 loss against
Bowling Green (2-7 MAC, 12-20
overall). Followinga solid outing
against Central Michigan last
Wednesday, he exhibited signs
of becoming a consistent force in
the starting rotation - at times
he was brilliant, and at other
times, when he was struggling,
he displayed the ability to work
out of trouble.
In 5.1 innings of work for the
Wolverines (2-4 Big Ten, 15-18),
Bourque allowed five hits and
one unearned run while striking
out six batters against a Falcons
offense that entered the match-
up batting near .300.
"He pitched a great game
today," said sophomore first
baseman Brett Winger. "He got
ahead of all of his hitters and his
breaking ball was pretty nasty.
We just didn't get the job done
for him."

After allowing a double to Fal-
cons left fielder Andrew Kubuski
in the bottom of the first inning
- a fly ball that was misplayed
by freshman left fielder Will
Drake - Bourque responded by
retiring the next eight batters he
faced, while striking out three.
"He's got good stuff," said
Michigan coach Rich Maloney.
"He was throwing three pitches
for strikes, so I think it's just
been (Bourque) getting out there
and getting more comfortable."
Though he was stellar early
in the game, Bourque's improve-
ment as a starter was most vis-
ible in the subsequent innings.
After silencing Bowling Green's
bats for three innings, Bourque
found himself headed for trouble
during the next two.
With one out in the fourth
frame, he relinquished back-
to-back singles before hitting a
batter with a pitch. But with the
bases loaded, Bourque remained
unflustered. He struck out des-
ignated hitter Patrick Lancaster
and got right fielder Jesse Rait to
ground into a fielder's choice to
get himself out of the jam.
The bottom of the fifth inning
brought more of the same for
Bourque. After retiring the first
two batters, he hit center fielder
Jake Thomas with a pitch and
gave up a single to third baseman
Logan Walker, putting runners
on first and second base with the
heart of Bowling Green's lineup
coming up. But with the count
full, he fanned Kubuski to leave
both base runners stranded.

"I think (my biggest improve-
ment) has mostly been throwing
strikes early, especially with my
off-speed pitches," Bourque said.
"Getting 0-1 and 0-2 on hitters,
and then being able to throw
three pitches for strikes, that's
big for me, so it helps a lot."
After allowing an unearned
run with one out in the fifth
inning, Bourque was relieved by
right-hander Alex Lakatos with
the game tied 1-1. Despite his
team giving up a late run to the
Falcons, Maloney was pleased
with Bourque's continued suc-
cess.
"He has grown as a pitcher
and has gotten better, so that's
encouraging," Maloney said.
Once a liability for the Wolver-
ines, Bourque has transformed
into a reliable midweek option.
In his first two starts, against
Chicago State and Eastern Mich-
igan, he allowed six earned runs
and walked nine batters in 6.1
innings, but his last two outings
have showcased a much different
hurler.
In Michigan's 7-3 victory
against Central Michigan,
Bourque allowed just two hits
and one earned run in three
innings to collect the win.
Though he earned a no-decision
against Bowling Green, he low-
ered his ERA from 4.70 to 3.48,
and his 5.1 innings were the most
he has thrown as a starter.
"I feel a lot more comfortable
(starting) and it's a lot more fun,
especially when you're throwing
strikes," Bourque said.

Carol Hutchins and senior first-
baseman Amanda Chidester
recently hinted that they owe
some motivation to their sweet
teeth.
Two weekends ago, in a series
against Indiana, the Wolverines
came into the final game having
split the first two 'games. Going
into the seventh inning with a
7-2 lead, Michigan looked to hold
on and close out the game and
the series. Freshman left-hander
Haylie Wagner's first and second
pitches were recorded as outs,
and it was then that Hutchins
decided to do something bold.
"I told the dugout, 'If we get
an out on three pitches, cupcakes
for everybody,' "Hutchins said.
Sure enough, after the ball
was hit to Chidester at first base
and fielded for the final out, the
dugout erupted.

taps into team's sweet tooth SOFTBALL
, tDresenga shows
promise at plate

Senior first baseman Amanda Chidester picks up an M&M from coach Carol Hutchins at third base.

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
In softball, it's rare that a pitch-
er finds her way into the batting
order, especially when she's also
starting in the circle.
But for Michigan's freshman
Sara Driesenga, it's a different
story.
On March 21, against Eastern
Michigan, Driesenga found her-
self in the lineup, both as a pitcher
and as a hitter. And she made the
most of both opportunities.
The right-hander notched three
strikeouts and gave up one earned
run in five innings, enough for her
fifth win of the season.
At the plate, Driesenga - who
held a .504 career batting average
in high school - drew a walk in
the first inning, then knocked in
two runs with a home run to left-
center field in the third inning.
And that was all Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins wanted.
"Sara has been swinging her
bat," Hutchins said. "We had her
off and on early in the preseason.
We really wanted her to spend
time focusing on her pitching and
working on her swing during prac-
tice, but we gave her an opportuni-
ty against Eastern Michigan."
Her performance against the
Eagles earned her a permanent
spot in the lineup as the designat-
ed player. The designated player
is the softball equivalent to the
designated hitter in baseball, just
with a different name.
"She earned her spot, and it's
hers to lose," Hutchins said.
Since then, Driesenga has a .491
average, tallied six RBIs and seven
runs, knocked in two solo home
runs - both in the first game
against Ohio State last weekend -
and drew five walks. And if you're
just looking at batting average,
with no minimum at-bats, Dries-

enga leads the team at .395.
Her pitching has also improved
since the nonconference schedule.
The Hudsonville, Mich. native
picked up her sixth and seventh
wins in conference play and has
improved her release, giving
her the ability to complete more
games. Though she's expected
to do well in the circle, she's
impressed in the batter'sbox.
But is Hutchins really surprised
by Driesenga's production?
"I don't know about surprised,"
Hutchins said. "We think she's
capable and she's been very poised'
in the box. We've been search-
ing throughout the year to find-
a lineup that's going to work for,,
us. We had a lot of different kids-
we looked to, and she responded
immediately and been really con-
sistent."
The infield has rotated numer-
ous times this season, including
spots on the field and in the bat-
ting order, while the outfield has-
remained somewhat constant.
Michigan was missing a ninth'
batter who could be a reliable'
threat. Hutchins tried freshman
catcher Becca Garfinkel, sopho-
more catcher Caitlin Blanchard
and even freshman left-hander'
Haylie Wagner, who batted well'
over .400 in high school.
But after her breakout perfor-
mance against Eastern Michigan,
Driesenga has found herself in the
lineup every game since.
And with Driesenga now a part
of a solid lineup, the Wolverines
have seen a significant jump in
offensive production across the
board.
"This is now the nine we're
going to go with at this point,"
Hutchins said, on the perma-
nent addition of Driesenga to the
lineup. "(And) we do seem to be
hitting our stride offensively. We
seem comfortable."

"Nobody on the field knew
what was going on, but the dug-
out went crazy because I'm not
above bribing them," Hutchins
said.

coaches to the ushers in Crisler
Center.
"I thought I was going to try
and keep it short," Douglass said
afterward, laughing. "Then you
just ramble on, ramble on, and I
didn't even realize how long it was
... until I was thanking the team at
the end and they were giving me
the hurry-up sign."
Douglass's lengthiness and long
list of people to thank prompted
Novak, the following speaker, to
jokingly thank his childhood dog,
Hoser. After a few more playful
jabs at Douglass, Novak's tone
grew serious as he reflected back
to all that he has accomplished in
his illustrious four years.
"You grow up and you have a
dream that one day, for us, you
want to play college basketball -
big-time college basketball, par-
ticularly in the Big Ten," Novak
said. "That day comes, and then
that day you dreamt about is yes-
terday. And you're left with the
memories."
It was revealed that the seniors
are responsible for designing the
Big Ten Championship rings, and
seldom-used senior guard Corev

Person drew some of the night's
loudest applause for his plea.
"We're all living testimoni-
als that those who stay will be
champions," Person said. "I've
been waiting to say this since I got
here, so Dave Brandon, we worked
hard and we made sure that those
(championship) rings are going to
look good, so I ask you to cut the
check."
Rounding out the award
winners were Jordan Mor-
gan, who took home the Loy
Vaught Rebounding award, and
Matt Vogrich for the Sixth Man
award. Sophomore forward
Evan Smotrycz, who recently
announced plans to transfer and
was the Wolverines' top bench
player, wasn't named as one of the
top three finalists.
EUROTRIP: Novak and Doug-
lass both shed some light on their
future plans to play professionally
next year in Europe.
The pair are both in talks with
agents and haven't yet settled on
where specifically they'd like to
play.
"I can't wait to get home and be
done with school" Douglass said.

"It'll be a while before any deci-
sion is made where I'm going."
The Carmel, Ind. native said
he likely won't leave the United
States until late August, as Euro-
pean leagues typically kick off in
September.
"I don't speak other languages
great, so if there's any bit of Eng-
lish, that helps," Douglass joked
when asked if he prefers any par-
ticular countries.
And while Novak has hinted
that he may want to put his Ross
Business School degree to work
immediately, Douglass indicated
other plans.
"Probably just playing - I can
finally just focus on basketball,"
he said.."When I get some money
- I have, let's just say, not much
money to my name right now, so
I've got to acquire some capital
first."
Novak's current status was sig-
nificantly more concise than his
teammate's.
"(I'll) hear pretty soon, as far
as agents go and everything, and
hopefully, go play overseas next
year and get some buckets," he
said.

Freshman guard Trey Burke took home the biggest hardware of the night: the Bill Buntin Most Valuable Player award.

always heard those scary stories about teachers comparing Scantron answer sheets or putting
essays through special websites, but I never actually believed them - or even if I did, I didn't
care. I had it perfected to a science: I'd sit in the lefty desks on the aisle, and I'd be elevated in
the stadium-style seating in the lecture hall. I could see everyone's Scantrons in the aisle adjacent to
mine. It worked for quite some time and in a variety of classrooms.
It was a stupid test. I was sitting next to my best friend, and I guess we were a little too confident
because we didn't notice our teacher noticing our blatant cheating. When we handed in our papers
(each at different times; we weren't that dumb), our professor made a suspicious comment. I tried to
play it cool and forget about it, but afterward I caught up with my friend, and she was worried.
A few days later, we both got separate e-mails requesting to meet with the professor individually.
I knew we were caught. He said if we formally wrote him a letter admitting to cheating, he wouldn't
notify the University, and we'd just receive zeroes on the test. My friend was more concerned about
writing that letter than getting a zero, which I thought was absurd.
That class ruined my GPA. I guess I was a little bitter about the whole thing because I couldn't

personal attack on Chris Armstrong, the
former president of the Michigan Student
Assembly, as an example of such informa-
tion. Armstrong and former Daily Editor in
Chief Jacob Smilovitz were both in order
together.
The potential conflicts of interest stem
beyond journalism, as LSA senior Brendan
Campbell, vice president of Central Student
Government, said he worries students won't
feel comfortable approaching a governing
body that works with a closed-door organi-
zation like Order.
"If a student government is to truly
be an inclusive and representative voice
of students on campus, then I think it's
wrong for its leaders to be part of such a
divisive and problematic organization,"
Campbell said.
Campbell is the former chair of the Uni-
versity's chapter of College Democrats, and
the group has a policy that forbids members
from joining Order.
Campbell added that Order is a "uniquely
damaging organization" whose time on cam-
pus has run out.
History is history
Public Policy senior Vidhi Bamzai, Order's
unofficial spokesperson, said that as a
woman with a social justice background, she
can't deny Order's incurred civil rights viola-
tions in the past.
Bamzai is the former chair of the South
Asian Awareness Network, a social justice
organization at the University. She said her
involvement with SAAN led to her getting
tapped by Order last year.
Bamzai said Order operates with members
at equal standing and releases its member list
every April to remain transparent.
She added that order is trying to move
beyond its contentious past.
"But that's exactly what it is - it's history,"
Bamzai said. "The organization that Order of
Angell is today is not the organization that it
was ... five years ago - and that's the beauty of
the 100-percent turnover."
Bamzai said having a new class of mem-
bers each year fosters constant change. This
year's class organized a scholarship for stu-
dent leaders and held an event called Leaders
for Life created for 90 up-and-coming sopho-
mores and juniors.
Bamzai established a formal relationship
between SAAN and the Muslim Students
Association, which she hopes will continue
after she graduates. She added that honorary
members like James Toy - the founder of the
Spectrum Center and an order member since
2000 - help Order take a step back and real-
ize what's best for campus.
In 1999, Toy was approached by then-
member Cory Fryling - the first openly gay
member of Michigamua - who petitioned
him to join the organization. Fryling was
a member of the Queer Unity Project and
thought Toy would bring a valuable perspec-
tive to the organization.
Fryling brought a big folder of historical

information to allay Toy's skepticism about
joining the group.
"I was dubious aboutjoining because, hav-
ing been here on campus since the 1960s, I
was aware of Michigamua's reputation and
the concerns that many members of the Uni-
versity had about the group," Toy said.
Toy said he ultimately joined because he
was concerned about ethos, and he figured he
could inspire more change by getting inside
of the organization rather than banging on it
from the outside.
He said he lobbies the group for greater
diversity.
"The more diverse a group is in its mem-
bership, the better decisions it will make,"
Toy said.
While the group defers to the phrase
"humility in secrecy," Toy said he thinks
modesty is a better explanation for why the
contents of their Monday night meetings are
kept hush-hush.
Fryling said, from his vantage point in Cal-
ifornia, where he now lives, the core purpose
of the organization hasn't changed much,
although it'sgained women and new perspec-
tive. He added that persuading Toy to join the
group was his biggest accomplishment.
"He's the most profound legacy I've left
behind," Fryling said. "He's been integral-

themselves.

Order and chaos

For decades, the University's secret society Mich-
igamua held its weekly meetings on the seventh floor
of the Michigan Union.
In Feb. 2000 University student Joe Reilly and
other representatives of the Students of Color Coalition opened
the door to their meeting grounds. What they saw shocked and
disgusted them, Reilly said in an interview yesterday.
The room was adorned like a Native American wigwam. Lin-
ing the walls were pictures of former Michigamua members
claspingtribal artifacts. Plaques displayed pictures of members
with nicknames such as "Great Scalper Yost," Reilly said.
Reilly and his cohorts occupied the tower for 37 days. In the
wake of their protest Michigamua was relocated. Gone was the
meeting space of the past 70 years.
Twelve years later you're tapped to join this organization.
The group's name is different now and it claims to have
moved away from its controversial past. But its proceedings are
still veiled in secrecy. This is evident from the tapping alone.
There is no application, no cover letter, no interview. Just the
tap. The tap, and a great feeling of pride.

a "peace pipe."
This is the hint of the racism that would impel Reilly and the
SCC to occupy Michigamua's meeting grounds in 2000.
Still, if you accept, you join a legacy that includes former
President Gerald Ford, Heisman winner Tom Harmon and hun-
dreds of other success stories.
If you decline, you recant a history that involves the imita-
tion of Native American culture in racist and insensitive prac-
tices, the exclusion of women members until 2000 and an air of
secrecy that has never been cleared.
The group's unofficial mission is to "fight like hell for Michi-
gan." But with a continued closed-door policy, what does the
group actually do?
Addressing and redressing
Michigamua changed its name to Order of Angell in 2006.
This change marked a deliberate distancing from a secretive
past.
This past included the decades spent on the seventh floor of

pseudo-Indian tribe on this public University campus to pro-
mote their kind of elitist view of leadership."
Leaving the Union after 37 days, the protesters took the arti-
facts with them.
In the wake of the protest Vice President for Student Affairs
E. Royster Harper commissioned a three-person panel to decide
the fate of the tower space. The panel recommended abandon-
ing the tower. Today the space is vacant and sealed off to the
public.
Michigamua changed its name to order of Angell. The new
namesake was wholly uncontroversial: a tribute to the iconic
University president who served from 1871 to 1909.
Now the group meets behind closed doors every Monday at
10 p.m. The location changes almost every week.
Despite the society's efforts to make reparations to its unsa-
vory history, Reilly still said he didn't think the organization
should have a place on campus.
"I don't think there's any way they could make themselves
acceptable or appropriate other than say, 'We're going to end
our organization,"' Reilly said.

organization. For Kulick, the secrecy of Order seems to con-
tradict the openness of his own group, which is all about
transparency. SOAP meets with focus groups. They talk to
Latino and African American students. Their works requires
accountability - something Kulick said Order's secrecy pre-
vents it from doing.
Out of about 5,700 rising seniors, roughly 25 members
become a part of the group.
Yet Order's members are not a representative sample of the
general student body. Up until the 1940s, only white men were
allowed. It wasn't until 2000 that women were admitted.
Men still outnumber women. Since 2009, the makeup of the
group has been 41.57 percent female and 58.43 percent male, a
Michigan Daily analysis found.
And despite Order's efforts to strike a balance among mem-
bership organizations, athletes still dominate. Between 2009
and 2012, an average of 36 percent of Order's members were
athletes, compared to the society's makeup of 13-percent
artists, 9-percent representatives of multiethnic/political
groups, 10-percent members of professional organizations

Getting tapped is no easy feat. Out of 25,000 nameless and
faceless undergraduates at this school, you're one of 25.
Order of Angell, the organization formerly known as Mich-
igamua, wants you to join their senior society.
You're out with a friend later that day and can barely contain
your excitement. I was tapped, you tell her.
Your friendtellsyou Order is aracist and sexistgroup. Anoth-
er friend is happy for you but points out that the group has only
recently moved away from a past wrought with mistakes.
Curious about what you might be getting yourself into, you
take the Commuter North bus to the Bentley Historical Library
to pore over boxes of documents and photos preserving the his-
tory of the secret society.
You discover Michigamua was conceived by University Pres-
ident James B. Angell and a group of then-juniors called the Hot
Air Club. You discover the traditions of Michigamua in a box
that includes pictures and lists of Native American-inspired
nicknames like Grunting Moose Davock and Squaw Cheek Cur-
tis. New members used to be publicly initiated on the steps of
the Michigan Union during "Rope Day," when members and
prospects dressed in mock-Native American attire and painted
themselves red. You also find a picture of new members passing

the Union.
But the Union meetings stopped when Reilly and other mem-
bers of the Students of Color Coalition occupied the seventh
floor of the Union. It was there that they discovered Native
American artifacts lying around - an explicit violation of an
agreement the group signed in 1989 banning such displays.
In an interview with The Michigan Daily, Reilly said the
SCC's occupation in Feb. 2000 was a long time coming.
"What we did was a continuation of students before us ...
who since the 1970s were trying to bring light to the fact that
Michigamua was appropriating Native American culture,"
Reilly said. "That created a hostile environment for Native
students on campus, to feel like your culture and your spir-
ituality was part of this hazing ritual. It was being appro-
priated by a group of non-native students who were very
privileged."
Past Michigamua members made allegations that the arti-
facts were strategically placed in the meeting space by SCC
members. But Reilly said the claims are "ridiculous."
"Whoever's alleging that we planted those items is trying to
hide the fact that those things were there and that's part of the
history of Michigamua," he said. "They basically created this

Speaking to the current University community, Reilly said
the administration should take a stance on Order. In 2000,
Reilly said they remained neutral, making the issue about the
fair allocation of space for student groups rather than about the
misuse of Native American culture.
Reilly said the SCC's occupy movement was motivated by
influencing future generations.
"It wasn't about our own self-interest," he said. "It was about,
'how do we create a more inclusive and a more supportive and
a more truly diverse University with our time here, with our
privilege and position as students."'
Tapped, you're not it
LSA junior Alex Kulick, lead team member of Students Orga-
nizing Against Prisons, an organization committed to abolish-
ing the prison industrial complex, was tapped to join order a
few weeks ago.
Within 24 hours he decided not to accept.
He said while he respects the work Order has done, he
declined membership.
Kulick said he's uncomfortable with the secrecy of the,

and 32-percent members from service groups, the Daily anal- 'W
ysis found.
Kulick pointed to factors like these as a reason he doubts
Order's ability to represent the student body as a whole.
Kulick added that he lauds Order's move toward diversity but
said the group has been slow on the uptake.
"Order has been making some small, incremental changes
over the years, but those changes need to be sort of larger and
more reconciliatory," Kulick said.
SOAP has strong relationships with other groups - the Black
Student Union and the Native American Student Association
among them - that openly disagree with order's policies and
history.
Last May, Order member and LSA senior Chatoris Jones was .A
asked to step down from his leadership positions in the Black
Student Union and Intellectual Minds Making a Difference
for accepting a tap from Order. Though Jones said he remains
friends with the BSU members, he is no longer permitted to rep-
resent the organization as he did previously.
In a May 2011 Daily article, BSU spokeswoman Samantha
Martin said Jones was asked to step down as treasurer of the
group because his actions violated BSU's constitution.
