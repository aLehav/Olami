There are five Ann Arbor 

City Council positions up for 
re-election this November, but 
Ward 5 on the city’s northwest 
side is the only contested race.

Incumbent 
Councilmember 

Chuck Warpehoski (D), who has 
served four years on City Council, 
is 
running 
against 
political 

newcomer David Silkworth (I), 
an insurance claim representative 
for homeowners and businesses.

In the August Democratic 

primary election, Warpehoski 
defeated challenger Kevin Leeser, 
a nurse in the University Health 
System, garnering 2,424 votes 
compared 
to 
Leeser’s 
1,120. 

Warpehoski was expected to run 

unopposed in the general election 
until Silkworth decided to enter 
the race as an independent in July.

Silkworth 
initially 
began 

collecting 
signatures 
to 
run 

as a Democrat in this year’s 
City Council election, but after 
attending the council’s meetings 
and further involving himself in 
local politics, he said he noticed 
his ideologies did not truly align 
with the sitting Democrats on 
the council, deciding to run as an 
independent.

Warpehoski 
and 
Silkworth 

hold opposing views on several 
issues, 
including 
property 

development in their ward and 
throughout the city.

In particular, Silkworth said 

he thinks there is currently a pro-

About 15 student leaders 

from 
organizations 
in 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan’s 

College 
of 
Engineering 

gathered Thursday night in 
Chesborough 
Auditorium 

on North Campus to hold 
a student-led review of the 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion plan.

The 
forum, 
sponsored 

by 
Engineering 
Student 

Government, is the first review 
in the College of Engineering 
to be restricted strictly to 
students to discuss the DEI 
plan — a five-year initiative 
launched earlier this month 
with the goal of improving 
campus diversity. The DEI 
plan includes strategies for 
each individual college at the 
University to cater to its own 
needs for diversity.

Attendees discussed racial, 

gender and identity diversity in 
an effort to expand upon earlier 
town halls held by the college 
and further the concerns raised 
in the college’s statement about 
the plan previously published 
in The Michigan Daily.

At a town hall organized by 

the College of Engineering on 
Oct. 11, Engineering Dean Alec 
Gallimore and members of the 
DEI planning team outlined 
the college’s goals to attendees. 
Engineering graduate student 
Abbhinav Muralidharan said 

in an interview before the 
Thursday event he felt it was 
productive to have a different 
dynamic than forums held 
in the past, especially with 
no faculty or administration 
present.

Thursday’s review consisted 

of an open dialogue during 
which 
student 
attendees 

discussed 
the 
contents 
of 

the College of Engineering’s 

strategies 
for 
improving 

diversity — specifically the 
plans for driving innovation 
and 
fostering 
creativity 

while reflecting the changing 
diversity in higher education 
nationwide. 
Students 
who 

spoke 
during 
the 
forum 

remained anonymous. Speakers 
vocalized concerns about what 
they described as the vagueness 
of 
a 
phrase 
“compelling 

reasons for diversity” as well 
as the prioritization of its 
main objectives and whether 
the strategic objectives can 
be applied to each of their 
organizations in narrowing the 
college’s gender and minority 
gaps.

Following a fatal car crash 

Tuesday near Huron High School 
that resulted in one death, some 
Ann Arbor residents have raised 
questions about whether City 
Council has deferred funding 
for pedestrian safety in favor of 
downtown projects — putting off 
slated crosswalk improvements 
for areas including the site of the 
crash.

Ann Arbor Huron High School 

student Qi-Xuan “Justin” Tang 
was struck by a car and killed 
around 7:20 a.m. on Tuesday 
morning while crossing Fuller 
Road, according to Ann Arbor 
Police and Ann Arbor Public 
Schools.

There is no definitive link 

between 
the 
crosswalk 
and 

this accident, and the AAPD 
has not yet released its accident 
report on Tuesday’s incident. 
However, local residents, like 
Kathy Griswold, a former Ann 
Arbor School Board member, 
noted there is no lighting for the 
crosswalk to Huron High School.

Samar Habib, associate researcher at the Centre for Gender Studies at the University of London, speaks about gender relations and sexuality in Islam at Weill Hall 
Thursday.

Three 
panelists 
discussed 

gender relations in the Quran, 
the 
decriminalization 
of 

homosexuality and the targeting 
of Yazidi women in Iraq by the 
Islamic State at a Digital Islamic 

Studies 
Curriculum 
event 

on human rights, gender and 
sexuality in the Islamic World 
Thursday night.

About 
75 
University 
of 

Michigan students, faculty and 
Ann Arbor residents were in 
attendance at the event, hosted 
as part of an ongoing series 
Contemporary Islamic Identities 

through 
the 
Islamic 
Studies 

Department among others.

Each panelist was given 15 

minutes to present their topic 
before Nobel Peace Prize Laureate 
Shirin Ebadi, a former judge in Iran 
and human rights activist, who 
provided 
remarks 
afterwards. 

Ebadi spoke Wednesday as part 
of the symposium on gender and 

sexuality in Islamic cultures, 
emphasizing 
that 
providing 

information on Islam is the best 
way to combat Islamophobia.

Asma 
Barlas, 
professor 
of

scripture that she said Muslims 
believe 
predetermine 
the 

patriarchal relations between 
men and women in the culture. 
She reads the Quran “as a liberty 
text” for women.

“This isn’t to say that the 

Quran doesn’t speak of women 
and men; it is only to point out 
that the Quran does not say 
that one is superior to another,” 
Barlas said. “For example, there 
are no voices that define women 
in terms of female attributes that 
are unique only to women … nor 
are there any voices that define 
men in terms of male attributes 
that are unique only to men.”

Samar 
Habib, 
associate 

researcher at the Centre for 
Gender Studies at the University 
of 
London, 
highlighted 
the 

topic of the decriminalization 
of homosexuality through a 
timeline of countries recognizing 
or failing to recognize “LGBT 
rights as human rights.”

Habib cited a memorandum 

released by President Barack 
Obama in 2011 on his dedication 
to the protection of LGBTQ 

rights. Habib said this meant the 
spotlight was on other countries 
to follow suit in supporting 
LGBTQ people.

She also referenced July 

2016 letter Amr Ramadan, 
Egypt’s ambassador to the 
U.N. Human Rights Council, 
sent a to the council president 
detailing his opposition to 
the appointment of a United 
Nations monitor against anti-
gay violence.

Habib saw this response as 

a way to get around enacting 
social 
change 
for 
LGBTQ 

individuals in Egypt.

“(Ramadan) 
argued 

basically the mandate’s stated 
purpose, which is to protect 
people 
from 
violence 
and 

persecution, was only a cover, 
a Trojan horse for a backdoor 
usurping 
of 
conditional 

cultural values, and now he 
starts to sound a lot more like 
Vladimir Putin,” Habib said.

Habib also said lawmakers 

and human rights activists 
globally have to keep in mind 
existing laws and cultures 
when enacting change.

development imbalance on City 
Council. While Silkworth has been 
most vocal about his opposition 
to the deer cull in previous 
public comments, he emphasized 
that 
protecting 
single-family 

neighborhoods from more large 
development projects has become 
a main component of his campaign.

“While 
very 
good 
at 
soft 

conversation, when it comes to hard 
issues, they (current City Council 
members) always come down on 

the side of development,” Silkworth 
said.

In an interview last week, 

Warpehoski said he sees future 
development projects as essential 
to solving the city’s affordable 
housing problem. He attributed 
current discussions around housing 
affordability to supply shortages, 
pointing to a lack of housing to 
accommodate the number of people 
who want to live in the city.

“Part of it is a supply and demand 

problem,” Warpehoski said. “One 
of the ways to address that part of 
the housing affordability problem 
is to increase our housing supply, 

so I am in favor of policies that help 
us increase our housing supply.”

One 
potential 
project 
the 

candidates are divided on is 
the 
city-owned 
Library 
Lot 

on Fifth Avenue and Williams 
Street. City Council has been 
discussing the idea of building 
a 17-story apartment complex 
in 
the 
currently 
empty 
lot. 

Councilmember Jack Eaton (D–
Ward 4) has proposed letting the 
public vote on the development 
of the space in the November 
election, but the current council, 
including Warpehoski, voted the 
measure down.

Silkworth said the use of the 

lot needs to be taken to a popular 
vote, adding that there needs to 
be greater trust in the public and 
transparency between all parties.

He also emphaized erm limits, 

nothing 
an 
upcoming 
ballot 

proposal to increase in mayor 
and City Council member term 
length from two to four years, 
Silkworth argues keeping the two 
years would lead to greater civic 
engagement.

working with you and others 
at the city over the past 14 
months, we have decided 
that the many unresolved 
important 
issues 
create 

too much uncertainty for 
us to sensibly continue our 
efforts,” Levin wrote.

Taylor was not immediately 

available for comment.

Affordable 
housing 

and an increase in high-
rises downtown have been 
controversial topics recently 
among Ann Arbor residents 
and students, including the 
library lot. In June, residents 
started a petition to attempt 
to halt the sale of the lot 

aiming to get a proposal on 
the November ballot that 
would prevent the sale of 
city 
property 
to 
private 

developers. 
However, 
the 

petition failed in July due to 
lack of certifiable signatures.

The city initially sold the 

lot to Dennis Dahlmann in 
April 2014 for $5.25 million 
following its use as a parking 
area. 
It 
was 
confirmed 

that Dahlman then sold it 
to Habitat this March. In 
the plans submitted to City 
Council, 
Habitat 
included 

at least 20 units designated 
for affordable housing with 
moderate rents, but some 
council members wished to 
see more affordable units and 
requested that the city staff 
renegotiate.

Looking forward, if the 

property is not developed 
by April 2018, the city will 
have the option to buy back 
the property for either the 
appraised 
value 
or 
$4.2 

million, though plans for 
the property’s future are 
unknown at this time. 

“The many 

unresolved important 

issues create too 

much uncertainty”

Drawing the line: Which side will you choose?

President Schlissel, the Board of 

Regents, and the Administration of 
the University of Michigan:

The University has continuously 

shown its allegiance and dedication 
to “defend” the right to freedom of 
speech, but fails at providing and 
promising safety for students of 
color. The safety of students should 
not come as an afterthought; it 
should be a priority. The active 
stance that the University has 
taken to ensure others their right 
to freedom of speech, such as 
refusing to erase the harmful 
Islamophobic messaging, should be 
comparable to the active measures 
the University is taking to protect 
its students of color.

There are issues that are 

impacting us right now, every day, 
and yet the University has remained 
stagnant in waiting on a strategic 
plan that isn’t doing anything for us 
right now. There are students that 
are impacted by the hateful actions 
of other students on our campus, 
and the administration is not 
concretely addressing the issues. 
Your statements are two days late 
and come after the labor of 600-
plus students speaking out about 
it. You failed to mention the events 
that occurred at Eastern Michigan 
University, 15 minutes away, that 
also greatly affected students at 
this University and in our greater 
community. You also failed to 
acknowledge the murders and the 
current state of the country. Black 
people are being murdered by the 
police every day, and the National 
Guard just recently enforced a 
police state in North Carolina.

Frankly, 
actions 
by 
the 

administration 
have 
felt 

disingenuous. 
They 
often 
are 

reactionary to student mobilization, 
including the most recent efforts 
by the administration to release 
statements. The University of 
Michigan’s Diversity, Equity & 
Inclusion plan was conveniently 
announced after the incident at the 
University of Missouri, and after 
Harvard and Yale’s commitments 
to increasing funding for diversity.

Efforts to have safe spaces for 

students of color to grieve and 
react to harmful, racist messages 
were overrun with white students 
who did not allow for the space to 
remain safe. There were so many 
students that were more concerned 
with their freedom to harm others 
in the space than with the ability of 
their peers to voice their fears and 
anxieties while being on campus. 
The student town hall meetings 

that were held regarding the DEI 
initiative were not productive 
because there were no spaces 
for marginalized folx to safely 
communicate their thoughts and 
ideas as those targeted by hatred 
on this campus. By having spaces 
available for all students, including 
those that cause harm, this serves 
as an exclusionary tactic because 
it effectively silences marginalized 
voices out of fear.

Sharing the stories of students 

of color to create the DEI plan 
reinforces 
the 
idea 
within 

academia that students who have 
marginalized identities need to be 
continuously retraumatized for 
the consumption and education of 
other students and faculty. Instead 
of creating spaces for students 
to share their hardships, create 
spaces for open conversation where 
you are listening to our voices 
and implementing practices that 
show your concerns for our safety. 
Be proactive and not reactive. 
An example of this is creating 
spaces for only students of color 
to engage within the community 

and contribute to both the DEI 
initiative, and our current campus 
climate.

We are the top public school 

in the country, yet we lag when 
it comes to truly creating an 
environment 
that 
engages 
in 

diversity, equity and inclusion. 
These words mean more than a few 
statements, open dialogues for all 
students to attend and a promise to 
give money to the cause.

These are our concrete demands 

as Black students and other 
students of color for President 
Schlissel:

Acknowledge our humanity and 

address us — Black folx and other 
people of color on campus — in 
person.

Create a space for Black students 

and other people of color without 
white students, before the launch 
of the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
Plan on Thursday, Oct. 6 at 9 am.

This space needs to be accessible 

(both physically and temporally) 
for the students that want to be 
addressed by you.

Declare solidarity with us as 

Black students and students of 
color, as well as with those same 
students at Eastern Michigan 
University and other schools in the 
nation who experience racism and 
anti-Blackness on campus.

Address the current events 

regarding police brutality and 
recognize 
how 
that 
impacts 

Black students, faculty and staff 
in our personal, professional and 
academic lives.

Construct more office hours 

and time for students to voice 
their concerns to the University 
president directly.

Continuously provide safe spaces 

for both Black students and other 
students of color to talk about the 
DEI plan as it’s being implemented 
without white students.

Create a unique short-term 

emergency 
plan 
with 
Black- 

and POC-student input made 
paramount — meant to address and 
redress issues within the next year.

Rename buildings to reflect 

students on campus and also to 
acknowledge the harm that the 
people the buildings are named 
after have caused.

Create a protocol that is more 

accessible for the entire campus 
community to be informed about 
bias incidents. We have the right to 
know about these incidents.

Fulfill the seven demands of 

the #BBUM movement that was 
presented two years ago.

Create a permanent designated 

space on Central Campus for Black 
students and students of color to 
organize and do social justice work. 
This is not the same as the Trotter 
Multicultural Center, because we 
want a space solely dedicated to 
community organizing and social 
justice work specifically for people 
of color.

Display a Black Lives Matter 

flag, as a physical symbol of 
solidarity for Black students on 
campus. Atop other clear policy 
changes that we are demanding, 
this is the recognition that students 
have said t hey need in order to feel 
safe on this campus. Black Lives 
Matter is not a political issue — it 
is a human rights issue, fighting for 
the humanity of Black folx.

We 
look 
forward 
to 
the 

University’s 
cooperation 
and 

solidarity in supporting Black 
people on this campus. The great 
Desmond Tutu once said, “If you 
are neutral in situations of injustice, 
you have chosen the side of the 
oppressor.” 
President 
Schlissel, 

Regents and the Administration, 
which side will you choose?

VIKRANT GARG

Michigan in Color Contributor

When I was in the fifth grade, 

my teacher pulled six students, 
including me, out of the classroom 
to discuss something separately. 
She began by introducing the topic 
as a secret, saying we should not 
repeat what we were about to hear 
to the other students left in the 
classroom. With a few nods and 
confused gazes, she proceeded 
to explain that we were to skip 
recess that afternoon and instead 
participate in “gifted” testing. As 
fifth graders, we weren’t quite 
sure what it meant to be tested 
as a “gifted” student. However, 
by reading the letters sent home 
to our parents, we were able to 
realize that it meant we were 
special in some way and that our 
teachers had high expectations 
of us. Curious to know what 
I could possibly be in trouble 
for, my classmates pestered me 
throughout the week until I 
finally gave in. After admitting 
to them that it was a test to 
examine if I was eligible to be in 
upper-level math courses, I could 
see the disappointment in their 
expressions as their shoulders 
slugged 
and 
their 
mouths 

responded with a simple “oh.”

“That’s boring. Of course you 

got tested for that. You’re Asian.”

I looked at my friends and we 

all chuckled. That was a funny 
joke.

A joke.
… But was it?
Growing up in predominantly 

white suburban neighborhoods, 
I 
became 
desensitized 
to 

stereotyping jokes and racial 
slurs. I grew up thinking that 
they were funny jokes — that 
my friends were just teasing. I 
was blinded by an image that is 
socially constructed and wrongly 
endorsed.

“Of 
course 
she’s 
good 
at 

geometry, she’s Asian.”

“Wow, Karen, you got a B? Isn’t 

that like an F to you?”

“Why aren’t you in orchestra? 

Shouldn’t you be good at the 
violin?”

I was numb.
Model minority — it’s all just 

a distorted image. There’s this 
veil around my shoulders that 
defines who I am before I even 
have a chance to introduce myself. 
I’m swallowed by stereotypical 
expectations that are apparently 
inherent to my nature when, in 
fact, I haven’t even started to 
discover who I really am.

So who am I? I am Asian 

American.

I am part of the model minority. 

I am perceived to be part of a 
group that is exemplary as many 
of my race have been known to 
highly succeed in the academic 

and occupational arenas. I am 
stereotypically seen to be more 
mathematically and scientifically 
inclined. I am supposed to be 
very educationally driven. I am 
expected to be musically talented.

But it’s a compliment!
No. It’s not.
Some may argue that a lot of 

the racism Asians face is not, in 
fact, racism because they involve 
“positive” 
characteristics. 
For 

example, 
stereotypical 
racist 

comments such as being good 
at math and being exceptionally 
intelligent 
are 
supposedly 

compliments and therefore not 
considered racist. They may argue 
that being considered the model 
minority is a good thing and that 
we should be grateful for the 
facade granted to us. These are 
ignorant and uneducated beliefs 
that do not consider the realities 
that Asians as a minority face. 
Racism cannot and should not 
be justified by its supposedly 
positive connotations. Not all 
Asian Americans grow up with 
the same circumstances, nor do 
we all have the same intellectual 
abilities. With model minority 
membership, we are assumed 
to have privileges and advanced 
capabilities. This is a conclusion 
drawn from ill-justified opinions 
that cannot be used as an excuse to 
legitimize racist thinking. In fact, 
this distorted image is detrimental 
to psychological health and brings 
heavy mental stress. When we as 
Asian Americans are expected to 
be above average simply due to 
our physical characteristics, we 
are pressured. We are pressed 

between walls with no room to 
discover ourselves by our own 
definitions. We are to fulfill 
certain standards that have been 
defined for us by those looking 
from the outside. We are defined 
by 
invalid 
generalizations 

and oppressed by the social 
institutions that endorse these 
generalizations.

The distorted image, in fact, 

creates somewhat of a cognitive 
dissonance to my psychological 
state of being. One part of me 
grips onto the social definitions of 
who I am. The other part breaks 
society’s rules and creates a new, 
unique identity. This dissonance 
shakes me until I finally realize 
that I don’t align with the social 

definitions I am expected to fulfill.

So who am I really? I am Asian 

American.

But I’m also not — in society’s 

terms. I’m really bad at any and 
every instrument there possibly is. 
My parents attempted to improve 
my musical senses by exposing me 
to the piano when I was young, but 
after six years of rigorous lessons 
and performances, I couldn’t 
develop a skill or a passion. In 
high school, I got a B in Algebra 
2 and that was with an incredible 
amount of work and studying. 
I do, however, devote a great 
amount of time and effort to the 
things I am passionate about. My 
results aren’t always exceptional, 
but they are true reflections 
of my best abilities. Over the 
past years of feeling numb to 
such 
racial 
discrimination, 
I 

have come to realize that social 
definitions 
do 
not 
constitute 

for my personal identity. I can 
create my own characteristics 
and qualities — they don’t have 
to be predetermined. To all the 
other Asian Americans suffering 
their own types of cognitive 
dissonance: There is always room 
in between the pressing walls to 
be someone you create.

This is not only a personal 

issue, but also a social one. The 
image given to Asian Americans 
is an illusion, and once that veil 
is stripped many will be able to 
see that we are just struggling 
humans. The success of all Asian 
Americans is not “natural,” not 
all of us have the abilities to 
attend a prestigious university 
or to accept offers from big name 
companies 
and 
firms. 
Those 

who do, however, work for their 
results. We are constantly aware 
of our place in this society and 
the discrimination we face from 
illegitimate social constructions. 
Thus, we push ourselves to work 
that much harder to achieve 
average 
and 
above-average 

results. So to those who assume 
that the Asian student sitting in 
class got a better grade simply 
because good grades are inherent 
to the color of her skin, I would 
like to remind you that social 
identities are only minuscule in 
effect. Next time consider the 
fact that she is not just Asian, but 
perhaps also a diligent worker.

Dear Mom

Dear Mom,
Remember when I was in first 

grade and you would sit behind 
me as I watched “Dragon Tales” 
with my cereal and comb my 
frizzy black hair with those bright 
Hello Kitty clips you brought for 
me from India? I’m sorry I took 
them out every day when I got on 
the school bus. I wanted so badly 
to have the smooth, blonde hair of 
the girls sitting in front of me and 
their headbands from Claire’s that 
I didn’t appreciate the gentle touch 
of your fingers running through 
my hair as you tried to tie a little 
bit of your motherland to me.

Remember when, as a shy third 

grader, I had to switch elementary 
schools and you were concerned 
about whether I would make new 
friends, if I would be able to find my 
voice? You loved it when I would 
have friends over to the house, 
helping us open bottles of nail 
polish and smiling as you would 
overhear our silly conversations. 
But most importantly, you loved 
to feed us. I’m sorry for the time 
when my “friend” said your 
pakoras and chaat were gross and 
smelled weird. I knew they were 
my favorite snack, you knew they 
were my favorite snack, but the 
words that came out of my mouth 
were, “Yeah, Mom, can you get 
us something else?” I saw the 
expression of sadness on your face 
as you quietly cleared the plate, 
but at that moment all I could 
think about was fitting in with my 
American friend. I found my voice, 
Mom, but I didn’t use it to stand up 
for you and for that, I am sorry.

Remember the half days I used 

to have at school and you would 
make time for us to have a lunch 
date? I’m sorry for all the times 
that I spoke over you and made you 
feel small. I’m sorry for forgetting 
that 
English 
was 
the 
third 

language you had to learn and for 
viewing your speech as something 
to be hidden rather than the act of 
courage that it is. You exist within 
a system that forces you to fight to 
have your voice heard, fight to be 
treated equally, fight to be valued 
and I’m sorry I perpetuated that.

Remember how I would always 

forget that I needed something 
the night before a class project 
was due? You’d put away the book 
you were reading, proceed to 
grab your keys and tell me to be 
more prepared next time. As you 
slipped your shoes on, I’d stand in 
the doorway anxiously scratching 
my head, “Mom, aren’t you gonna 
change?” I’m sorry for all the 
times I questioned when you wore 
traditional clothes in public and 
for making you feel as though I 
was ashamed of your appearance. 
What I viewed as yet another 
barrier obstructing my quest to 
be “American” was your attempt 
at holding on to a little bit of home 
and I’m sorry I didn’t understand 
that.

Throughout my childhood, I 

always questioned whether I was 
Indian or American. Whenever 
I was asked that question or 
asked where I was from, I’d give 
a different answer each time, 
accompanied by a convoluted, 
long-winded explanation that 
was representative of my own 
confused 
inner 
monologue. 

Truth is, I really didn’t know 
what I was. I knew that I loved 
standing on a stool next to 
you in the kitchen to help you 
make rotis and stuff samosas. 
But I also knew that I loved 
listening to Christina Aguilera 
and making gingerbread houses 

and Christmas cookies with my 
friends. I didn’t understand how 
a duality could exist.

But you did.
You’ve taught me a lot of 

lessons, Mom, from how to tie my 
shoes to pursuing an education 
I care about. But the most 
important thing you’ve taught 
me is how to embrace myself. 
You have made many sacrifices; 
you crossed an ocean with little 
more than blind optimism and 
began a new life in a new country 
with only two suitcases. Yet you 
never sacrificed your culture 
or your roots and the weight of 
that decision is finally resonating 
with me.

Growing up, I projected my 

discomfort with myself and 
my identity onto you. And in 
doing so, I failed to see that the 
answer to my question was right 
in front of me. You showed me 
that I am my strongest and best 
self when I stop attaching labels 
to each facet of my identity 
and simply embrace what feels 
natural. There is no checklist 
that I have to cross off to prove 
that I am a real American. There 
is no specific way to be a real 
American. I can, and I do, love 
two countries and their cultures 
with all of my heart, even though 
fully accepting the duality of 
my identity has taken me nearly 
20 years. One of them is the 
country I took my first steps in 
and where our family is. The 
other is where I have grown up, 
met my best friends and had so 
many opportunities. Thousands 
of miles separate them, yet in 
my heart they are inextricably 
linked forever. Thank you, Mom, 
for giving me the space and 
time to understand this, and 
especially thank you for a safety 
net of love to fall back on.

Love,
Rishu

Frankly, actions by 
the administration 

have felt 

disinegenous.

Some may argue that 

a lot of the racism 

Asians face is not, in 

fact, racism.

Racism cannot and 

should not be justified 

by its supposedly 

positive connotations.

W

ith Halloween fast 
approaching, 
so 

comes the narrative 

of 
costumes 
stained 
with 

cultural 
appropriation 
and 

racism. Yes, there are posters 
hung across the University 
of 
Michigan 
to 

say 
costumes 
like 

these 
are 
wrong, 

but there still are 
ignorant 
people 

who will choose to 
sport 
blackface 
or 

insensitive garb that 
incorrectly represents 
a culture of people. 
We’ll see it on the 
streets on our way to 
parties and we’ll see 
it all over the news in the days 
surrounding the holiday.

Sadly, 
some 
people 
who 

wear culturally inappropriate 
costumes don’t think about 
how it could be wrong. They 
don’t think about how others 
react, believing it’s a joke and just 
all in good fun. They wouldn’t 
know what it would feel like to 
be made fun of in a horrific way. 
Cultural appropriation has been 
happening for hundreds of years, 
from Nazis persecuting the Jews 
to the days when intellectuals 
argued that African Americans 
had smaller brains than white 
Americans 
descended 
from 

Europeans. 
It 
still 
happens 

today 
through 
unfortunate 

dressing up, cartoons and racist 
comments, among other things.

I’ve been lucky to grow 

up in a very diverse town of 
Black, white and Arab folks, 
where we learned about one 
another’s cultures and had 
great discussions about being 
respectful to each other when 
discussing 
topics 
like 
race 

and religion. I’ve been lucky to 
be born to a Black father and 
a white mother, seeing both of 
my races and what comes along 
when they collide and mix head 

on. Other people haven’t had the 
same experiences as me, being 
closed off into communities 
of one race, possibly unable to 
learn about what it’s like to walk 
in another person’s shoes.

The time to eradicate this 

problem completely 
is now. Hatred from 
Donald 
Trump 

and some of his 
followers 
and 

hatred from your 
neighbor who may 
have said a racist 
comment 
cannot 

be tolerated. Some 
people think that 
making 
general 

assumptions 
is 

harmless, and they don’t see 
the fault in their ways or how 
it can make an entire culture 
look less sophisticated and 
misrepresented. We need to be 
more vocal in our discussion, 
for all involved to ask and 
answer 
questions. 
Without 

this, 
division, 
silence 
and 

racism perpetuate and progress 
toward inclusion and empathy 
is stagnant.

When 
these 
situations 

occur, it’s very difficult for the 
offended party to speak up. 
Whether the person who feels 
compelled to say something 
has been personally attacked 
or just feels that the costume is 
flat-out wrong, confronting the 
insensitive person is difficult 
to do. First of all, being 
confrontational is a challenge 
and can even be affected by 
factors such as the surrounding 
environment 
and 
the 

relationship you have with the 
person in question. As the only 
Black man surrounded by a vast 
majority of white colleagues in 
almost all of my classes, every 
day I wonder what people are 
thinking about when I speak 
up. The situation only escalates 
when conversation becomes 

confrontational. The person 
defending themselves may be 
wondering where their support 
is and is likely more apt to 
remain silent because they feel 
alienated in their frustration.

If you see this problem this 

Halloween weekend or ever, 
please say something. Don’t be 
silent and allow the ignorance 
to persist. You owe it to yourself, 
those who could be hurt and the 
person wearing the inappropriate 
costume to use your voice to 
point out the injustice. It may be 
awkward, but the awkwardness 
is worth doing the right thing.

Just like it’s tough to be 

confrontational, 
asking 
and 

answering 
questions 
makes 

us extremely vulnerable. Both 
sides wonder if the person 
they’re discussing with will 
listen or understand where 
they’re 
coming 
from. 
For 

change to happen, we must 
be willing to take a risk in 
this way, moving past our fear 
in hopes of progress. People 
can be afraid of coming off as 
racist or insensitive if they ask 
questions about things they 
don’t understand. But a genuine 
inquisition will come through 
if they ask from a perspective 
of empathy, improving the 
conversation of representation 
for all.

Halloween is dubbed as the 

scary holiday, but the real fright 
is racism and misappropriation. 
This fear digs right into the 
heart of many and is still a root 
problem in our nation. Hopefully 
someday we will no longer need 
posters explaining that cultural 
appropriation 
can 
happen 

through costume, but without 
conversation, we all face an 
uphill battle. Let our words be as 
strong as our actions.

M

y grandmother recently 
had the opportunity 
to upgrade her phone. 

She’s had the same flip phone for 
years, and during a recent trip to 
the Verizon store with my father 
and me, a salesman recommended 
that she upgrade to an 
iPhone. She turned to 
me and asked, “Why 
would I need this?” My 
dad chimed in that she 
could have access to her 
email account, and the 
salesman 
mentioned 

she’d have far superior 
texting functionality.

This is a woman who 

just about always knows 
what she wants, and a 
new phone was not on her list. She 
explained that she didn’t need to 
text; she prefers calling. She didn’t 
need mobile access to her emails. If 
she’s out, she can just check when 
she gets home. She didn’t need to 
download the plethora of mobile 
applications so often associated 
with people of our generation — 
Snapchat, Tinder, Facebook and 
Spotify come to mind — because 
she just wouldn’t use them.

For my grandmother, an iPhone 

(or an Android for that matter) 
would be more bling than tool. The 
implications of this interaction set 
up camp in the back of my mind, 
and I’ve since come to a somewhat 
stunning conclusion: I hate what 
my phone has done to me.

Studies show that 89 percent 

of smartphone users aged 18 to 
24 reach for their devices within 

15 minutes of waking up in the 
morning. People in the same 
demographic exchange an average 
of nearly 110 text messages every 
day and are prone to texting more 
than calling one another.

There 
is 
an 
argument 
in 

there 
somewhere 

for 
heightened 

connectedness or for 
encouraging 
people 

to communicate more 
appropriately. 
After 

all, you can’t get away 
with a phone call in 
a movie theater, but 
provided 
that 
you 

reduce your screen’s 
brightness, 
texting 

in that environment 

isn’t all that taboo. But research 
importantly reveals that texting 
is making us conversation-phobic, 
less sincere and in some cases, 
more isolated and sleep-deprived.

So what are we clinging to?
Our parents used to have to 

look up people’s phone numbers 
and call them if they wanted to 
talk; hell, so did we! There was 
ceremony involved in sitting 
down to catch up with someone 
or making plans with them. But 
hey, why hop on a quick phone 
call to deliberate plans for going 
out when we can take longer to 
sort through scattered group text 
conversations where everyone 
receives the messages at slightly 
varied time intervals?

People 
used 
to 
read 

newspapers. 
Our 
Facebook-

oriented generation scrolls down 

newsfeeds. We wade through 
trending videos of people dancing 
to “Juju On That Beat,” 35-second 
BuzzFeed Tasty food porn and 
recycled articles from April about 
Trump’s children forgetting to 
register to vote in the primaries 
before we happen upon our 
current events and politics for the 
day. At least I know how to make 
cheeseburger onion rings!

Look, it’s not that I don’t like 

the slow crumbling of my posture 
brought on by texting, accidentally 
bumping into people (or inanimate 
objects) on my way to class or 
feeling like I can’t enjoy a moment 
unless I’ve chronicled it on my 
Snap Story. These are tenets of 
modern greatness! But the grass is 
always greener on the other side.

On the days I’ve left my phone 

at home before taking a walk in 
the Arb, completely turned it 
off in class or had a face-to-face 
interaction without having a 
device to divide my attention, the 
experiences I’ve had have been 
more meaningful and memorable.

Our use of technology isn’t 

inherently bad or unnecessary, 
but anything in excess can be 
detrimental, and I think we have a 
tendency toward excess. I’m all for 
“connectedness,” but maybe the 
irony is we can only achieve that 
if we know how to periodically 
unplug. In the meantime, I’ll be 
researching flip phones.

Going unplugged

As it currently stands, the 

proposed legislation would prohibit 
local governments from enacting 
their own taxes or additional 
licenses, require companies to 
pay an annual fee and register 
with the state, mandate state and 
federal background checks and 
annual safety inspections, and 
compel drivers to take the most 
direct route unless the passenger 
specifies otherwise. Essentially, 
the bills create a space for ride-
hailing services in the state’s laws, 
but they don’t address some of the 
more tenuous problems that come 
along with these services.

First and foremost, there is a lack 

of substance when it comes to the 
enforcement of these regulations. 
The bill notes the suspension or 
revoking of licenses from drivers, 
but no other punishments for the 
company. Too often, customers 
are taken advantage of by taxis 
and ride-hailing options like Ubers 
and Lyft. Though accountability 
of some form exists due to the 
GPS system, there are many 
other methods by which a driver 
can scam a customer, especially 
tourists and out-of-state students 
who may not know the area they 
are traveling in very well. 

That said, a potential positive 

of the pending legislation is that it 
avoids the mistakes that other local 
governments have made, such as 
that of Austin, Texas. Earlier this 
year, Uber and Lyft pulled out of 

the 11th-largest city in the United 
States after the city proposed 
strict regulations, including the 
mandatory 
fingerprinting 
of 

all drivers. In their attempt to 
maintain the delicate balance 
between safety and innovation, 
local officials in Austin failed.

However, 
the 
motivation 

behind the Austin policy — to 
provide 
maximum 
safety 
to 

citizens — is understandable and 
needs to be made a priority in 
any new legislation that regulate 
ride-hailing services. Among the 
popularity of apps such as Uber 
and Lyft, research suggests that 
there has been an increase in 
assaults against passengers in 
ride-hailing taxi settings. Three 
drivers in Chicago were charged 
with sexually assaulting their 
passengers over the course of 
the past two years; in more 
than one case, the victim was 
highly intoxicated. A similar 
assault occurred just last month 
around San Diego, when an Uber 
and Lyft driver was accused 
of 
assaulting 
three 
teenage 

passengers. Perhaps the most 
tragic and relevant example to 
pinpoint the necessity of new 
legislation occurred in February 
in Kalamazoo, when Jason Dalton 
killed six people and wounded two 
others (while driving for Uber). 
Hours 
after 
the 
shootings, 

he blamed his iPhone for the 
attacks, saying that it directed 

him both where to go and when 
to shoot.

The evidence is clear that the 

current state of the company’s 
background 
checks 
is 
simply 

not doing enough to protect its 
passengers. It is a reasonable 
expectation of a customer that 
when they download this app, they 
will be transported safely from 
one place to another by someone 
who does not have a criminal 
background and is mentally stable.

A recent bill in California makes 

important strides in this respect. 
This new bill prohibits companies 
such as Uber and Lyft from hiring 
registered sex offenders, as well 
as those who have been convicted 
of felonies or have driven under 
the influence in the last seven 
years and mandates a fine of 
between $1,000 and $5,000 when 
companies 
violate 
background 

check rules. This bill supplements 
the ride-hailing checks and provide 
for the safety of millions of citizens 
who use these services. Michigan 
should take note.

Now that the Michigan state 

legislature is seeking to bring more 
regulation and specific legal status to 
these ride-hailing companies, it is a 
reasonable expectation that some of 
these more substantial regulations, 
like those that California has 
implemented, 
will 
follow 
and 

provide more accountability and 
safety to Uber and Lyft users across 
the state of Michigan.

O

ne of the most likely 
ways your friend, peer, 
student or child will 

die in college is by suicide. 
Though researchers at the 
University of Virginia have 
found that college students are 
less likely to commit suicide 
than those of the same age (18 
to 24) in the general population, 
suicide is responsible for more 
student deaths than alcohol 
use. According to the American 
Psychological 
Association, 

the 2010 National Survey of 
Counseling Center Directors 
reported that the incidence of 
serious mental health issues 
on campus has risen 16 percent 
since 2000. The APA also admits 
that though significant measures 
have been put in place to address 
students’ mental health concerns, 
campus 
counseling 
centers 

struggle to maintain expanding 
student need. Something more 
needs to be done.

The 
American 
College 

Health Association National 
College 
Health 
Assessment 

for spring 2014 shows that 
between spring 2013 and spring 
2014, 13.5 percent of students 
reported depression as a factor 
that negatively affected their 
studies. The percentage of 
students who report depression 
as a prominent factor affecting 
their studies was much greater 
than student reports of drug 
and alcohol use, which stand 
at 1.8 percent and 4.1 percent, 
respectively. 
Furthermore, 

2.5 percent of college students 
report 
having 
seriously 

considered suicide.

Based on the ACHA data, 

alcohol use may increase the 
prevalence of suicidal ideation 
among college students. As 
alcohol use remains a salient 
issue on campus, it could 
be placed under the student 
mental health umbrella, under 
which all major student mental 
health 
concerns 
could 
be 

prioritized based on student 
need. The reported incidences 
of 
depression 
and 
suicidal 

ideation should not be ignored, 

nor should the link between 
student behavior and mental 
health. Let’s take a break from 
facts and figures, and bring 
this a little closer to home.

Self disclosure: As a current 

graduate student in the School 
of Social Work, I have been 
diagnosed with anxiety and 
depression, still struggle to 
overcome it and have seriously 
considered suicide at various 
junctures in my life, roughly 
beginning 
when 
I 
was 
a 

teenager. There have been 
numerous times when I was 
afraid to talk about it with 
others, and my fear often kept 
me from acting authentically.

As an undergraduate transfer 

student at the University of 
Michigan, I was required to 
participate in AlcoholEdu for 
College, an online program 
that has demonstrated success 
in reducing high-risk behaviors 
related to alcohol use among 
students. Student drinking is 
a public health concern, and 
programs designed to address 
the 
issue 
are 
important 

and can be effective, but I 
wonder if ableism contributes 
to the stigma attached to 
conversations 
about 
suicide 

and depression. A program 
similar 
to 
AlcoholEdu 
but 

geared 
to 
positively 
affect 

students’ more pressing mental 
health needs would confront 
institutionalized 
ableism 

and address what appears to 
be a greater student need. If 
programs like AlcoholEdu have 
been effective to limit risky 
student 
drinking 
behaviors, 

why have incoming students 
(as freshmen or otherwise) not 
been required to participate 
in a similar online program 
to address the more pressing 
issue of student suicide and the 
prevalence of depression?

On April 26, 2015, University 

students gathered in the Diag 
to show support for a student 
who had posted a suicide 
note on the social media app 
Yik Yak. The note sparked a 
larger discussion about the 
reality of student suicide and 
depression and the importance 
of acknowledging the reality of 
mental health issues on campus. 

One student interviewed by 
MLive discussed that though 
Wolverines 
compete 
with 

one another in the academic 
setting, it is still important 
to reach out in support and 
demonstrate 
concern 
for 

other 
students’ 
well-being. 

Some “yaks” posted to the site 
after the incident stressed 
the 
importance 
a 
friend’s 

intervention played in keeping 
them safe.

Recent social work literature 

would support what students 
said in their “yaks.” In Barry 
Duncan’s 
edited 
anthology, 

“The 
Heart 
and 
Soul 
of 

Change,” John Norcross, a 
professor at the University of 
Scranton, demonstrated that 
the effective use of empathy 
is among the most predictive 
components 
of 
positive 

psychotherapy 
outcomes 
— 

even more so than deploying a 
specific intervention model.

This leads me to believe that 

students’ 
everyday 
practice 

of empathy can significantly 
transform student experience. 
An 
educational 
program 

providing some basic empathic 
techniques might be helpful 
in reducing the incidence of 
depression and suicidal ideation 
among students, as well as 
creating a more nurturing and 
respectful student body. In 
regard to the racism that exists 
on campus as evidenced by the 
recent flyer and hate speech 
incidents, a more empathic 
student body might not only 
reduce 
depression 
among 

students and begin to redress 
ableism on campus, but also 
might reduce the likelihood 
of 
racist 
and 
heterosexist 

attacks on vulnerable groups 
or individuals.

I echo the sentiment that 

support from peers, often just 
feeling listened to, has greatly 
influenced my decision to keep 
going. It’s time we speak up for 
ourselves and one another and 
consistently challenge each other 
to learn to listen and confront 
privilege and oppression.

Bill should address Uber safety
O

ver a year ago, the Michigan House of Representatives began debating 
the lack of regulations on ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft, 
attempting to clear up the legal gray area in which these companies 

have been operating. Now, the Michigan House Legislature is in the process 
of considering a similar package of bills that would seek to address this issue, 
as well as provide regulation for all transportation companies across the state. 
Though this proposed legislation seeks to provide a necessary answer to 
questions surrounding these companies place in the state of Michigan, it fails 
to address certain aspects of safety and accountability that surround this issue.

BBC AMERICA

The hound of the Baskervilles

From the pages of Douglas 

Adams, author of “The Hitch-
hiker’s 
Guide 

to 
the 
Galaxy,” 

comes a quirky 
television 
series 

that plays off of 
the ages-old trope 
of an intelligent, 
yet socially awk-
ward 
detective 

who solves crimes 
for a living. This 
setup is not out-
side of the BBC’s 
domain, 
as 
the 

network is well-
known for their 
modern adaptation of Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes 
in the acclaimed series “Sher-
lock.” However, in this case, the 
name is Dirk Gently, and the 
game is solving crimes in the 
most holistic, matter-of-chance 
manner allowed in the murder 
business.

Over the past few years, the 

BBC has kept relatively close to 
its own territory, struggling to 
deviate from its more developed 
and popular series, so it’s nice to 
see the network taking chances 
in “Dirk Gently.” From start to 
finish, “Dirk Gently’s Holistic 
Detective Agency” is as eccen-
tric and exotic as its name sug-
gests.

The lead of “Dirk Gently” ’s 

pilot is not the titular detec-
tive himself, but rather Todd 
Brotzman (Elijah Wood, “The 
Lord of the Rings” series), a 
hapless hotel employee whose 
life is turned upside down by an 
impossibly grisly murder scene. 
This role marks Wood’s return 
to television, following a run-
ning lead on the cult comedy 

“Wilfred,” a stint that prepared 
him for his role as a struggling 
young man on “Dirk Gently.”

Adapted for television by 

screenwriter 
Max 
Landis 

(“Chronicle”), the 
series glances at 
the detective busi-
ness through an 
indie film lens, not 
unlike the work 
of Wes Anderson. 
From a trapped 
young woman in 
the upstairs flat 
that 
glows 
red 

to the corgi that 
follows Todd in 
a distinctly un-
canine 
manner, 

nothing 
about 

this series is generic. In its own 
way, the series is venturing into 
cult-classic territory through 
dabbling in the abnormal and 
impossible.

In fact, the premise of the 

series seems to pull a lot from 
the world of impossibilities. 
Dirk Gently (Samuel Barnett, 
“Penny Dreadful”) is horribly 
reminiscent of the weird kid 
down the street who reads just a 
little too much Star Wars fanfic-
tion than should be comfortably 
allowed. Gently is a self-pro-
claimed “holistic detective” — 
as in, he literally does nothing to 
solve a case. Believing in chance 
and the universal interconnect-
edness of events, he lets fate do 
the heavy lifting, opting to just 
sit back and enjoy the ride. More 
times than not, Gently’s manner 
of solving a case doesn’t actually 
work, but it’s all in good fun, as 
Barnett’s mannerisms and per-
sonality make him the perfect 
choice for the eccentric detec-
tive. You’ll find it difficult not to 
burst into a grin when his char-
acter steps on screen.

Even the real detectives are 

almost as absurd as Gently. 
Everyone seems to be after Dirk 
Gently for one reason or anoth-
er. The CIA, the FBI, two bum-
bling Black Ops, the local cops 
and a crazed holistic assassin all 
seem to have it in for Mr. Gen-
tly, for reasons unknown to us at 
this point in the season. Howev-
er, these colliding plot lines indi-
cate a direction for the show, 
which is a promising thought 
after just the first episode of 
the season. Who is the holis-
tic assassin? What happened to 
the girl in the Red Room? Who 
is Dirk Gently, though — real-
ly? The previous questions just 
prove that we’re in for quite the 
show in the coming episodes.

As 
the 
detective-assistant 

crime fighting formula tells us, 
you cannot have a relationship 
between a private investigator 
and their assistant without first 
dragging in an unwilling par-
ticipant.

It is in this manner that Todd 

finds himself thrown (quite lit-
erally) into the absurd world of 
the time traveller Dirk Gently. 
Desperately needing the money 
to fund the care for his sister’s 
delicate psychological condi-
tion, Todd reluctantly agrees 
to follow Gently around on his 
crime-solving escapades.

However, secret organiza-

tions and assassins aside, there 
are still a hundred and two 
other forces threatening to tear 
the duo apart — even if the uni-
verse seems intent on keeping 
them together. All of this may 
seem like a lot to swallow after 
only the first episode of the sea-
son, but direction is everything 
and “Dirk Gently” is certainly 
on the path to becoming a suc-
cessful crime-com for the mod-
ern day Sherlock enthusiast.

TV REVIEW

I 

have a confession to make: 
I should have written this 
a long time ago. And I’ve 

been thinking about doing so for 
months now, balancing on the 
edge between action and inac-
tion, resolution and hesitance. 
But I waited, caught up in the 
tide of life, busy with study and 
art. About a week ago, I real-
ized that I should wait for a very 
specific amount of 
time. I should wait 
until now. Today is 
almost exactly three 
months to the day 
since the Finnish 
composer Einojuhani 
Rautavaara died, and 
I have some things 
to say.

There is a running 

joke of sorts amongst 
some of my col-
leagues at The Michigan Daily 
— namely, it’s often remarked 
that I’m the person who can be 
relied upon to write about dead 
composers. This is undeniably 
true — after all, with my strong 
interest in classical music, I 
write an awful lot about com-
posers who have been dead for 
decades or more. But this isn’t 
what they mean when they say 
I write about dead composers. 
They mean that I write about 
our world’s recently deceased 
artists, the composers who were 
among us and then suddenly 
aren’t anymore. And I suppose 
I’m well-suited for it, having 
both the requisite knowledge 
base and the melancholic tem-
perament. Last winter I wrote 
about Boulez and Bassett, feel-
ing that they were people who 
deserved a moment of our atten-
tion, a little piece of silence away 
from the noise of existence. 
When I heard of Rautavaara’s 
death, this summer I knew that 
he deserved the same.

I wouldn’t characterize Rau-

tavaara as an extremely popular 
or well-known composer, but 
among those who were familiar 
with his work, he was loved. 
When I heard of his death this 
summer, I was in Paris studying 
music with a number of fellow 
composers — unsurprisingly, 
that night there was a large sec-
tion of dinner-table conversation 
dedicated to Rautavaara, and 
among us there wasn’t a single 
negative opinion. Such was the 
breadth of his appeal; within a 
group of composers, a disparate 
handful with interests and aes-
thetics ranging from modernism 
to minimalism to traditional 
tonalism, Rautavaara had some-
thing for everyone. And I think 

this is because, over the course 
of his 87 years, it was almost as 
if Rautavaara was several differ-
ent composers.

Not everyone knows this, but 

the word “retrospective” actu-
ally has two definitions. The 
first is common usage of “look-
ing back,” but the second deals 
specifically with surveying the 
life’s work of a particular art-

ist. In Rautavaara’s 
case, there is a lot 
to talk about. Ever 
evolving, Rautavaara 
wrote both music that 
is atonal and serial-
ist, and music that is 
lusciously tonal and 
Romantic in senti-
ment. But, at least to 
my ears, one of the 
most striking aspects 
of Rautavaara’s music 

is its remarkable Finnishness.

Finland isn’t famous for its 

composers — over the course 
of its history, there have been 
maybe only a handful who have 
entered the mass conscious-
ness of what we’d call Western 
civilization. Even I, with a 
significantly larger than aver-
age knowledge of the field, can 
name only a few, most of whom 
are active today (including Kaija 
Saariaho, whom I adore and 
wholly recommend seeking out). 
The titan of Finnish classical 
music is the great symphonist 
Jean Sibelius, and it was this 
“greatest Finnish composer” 
who was an early champion of a 
young Rautavaara’s work, a man 
who in recent weeks has been 
lauded as “the greatest Finnish 
composer since Sibelius.” Tak-
ing these two greats together, 
though focusing on the latter, 
one can hear some of the funda-
mental characteristics of Finn-
ish classical.

Finland is a country caught 

between worlds. A nation asso-
ciated with — yet distinct from 
— Scandinavian culture, it also 
bears strong influences from 
its eastern neighbor, Russia. At 
the crossroads of the Cold War, 
Finland balanced in an awkward 
position of neutrality, remaining 
independent of both NATO and 
the Warsaw Pact while the Sovi-
et Union simultaneously stuck 
its hands into Finland’s politics. 
German politicians of the day 
even coined a neologism for this 
type of practice — Finlandiza-
tion. On top of all that, Finland 
counterintuitively speaks a lan-
guage whose closest relative is 
Hungarian.

All of this can be heard in 

Rautavaara’s music. Or at least, 

in an abstract sense it can be. 
Like his compatriot Sibelius, 
Rautavaara composed large-
scale orchestral works in the 
dramatic vein of the great Ger-
man symphonists (Brahms, 
Bruckner, Mahler and the like) 
that also embraced a sound 
world that is often described as a 
“brooding Nordic atmosphere.”

But when listening to a work 

like “Symphony No. 7, ‘Angel 
of Light’ ” for instance, one 
can’t help but notice a striking 
similarity to the Soviet com-
poser Dmitri Shostakovich in 
the orchestrations and colors. 
You can find this sort of cross-
cultural influence everywhere. 
Rautavaara’s early opera “Kai-
vos” is loosely based on Soviet 
policy during the Hungarian 
uprising of 1956, but its musical 
language is distinctly Western — 
throughout the opera, he sounds 
quite close to the aesthetic of the 
Second Viennese School, a man-
ner of writing that at that time 
was dominant in European and 
American universities, yet never 
took hold in Russia. Specifically, 
he reminds one of the supple and 
expressive atonality of Berg, and 
he was directed influenced by 
Schoenberg’s opera “Moses und 
Aron.”

Rautavaara himself was well 

aware of this dichotomy — writ-
ing in the foreword to the score 
for his “Missa a cappella,” he 
notes “I was born and live in 
a country on the borderline 
between East and West: Fin-
land, between the Orthodox and 
Roman Catholic/Lutheran reli-
gions.” The reason he includes 
mention of this in the score 
for a mass was because he had 
already written an Orthodox 
Vigil. To balance this with a 
piece of Catholicism seemed 
only fitting.

But whatever the pushes and 

pulls on his music are, no mat-
ter what you listen to, it remains 
uniquely his own. Despite the 
numerous influences, when you 
listen to Rautavaara, it is always 
Rautavaara as an individual 
you hear. Whether you put on 
Rautavaara the modernist, or 
Rautavaara the neo-Romantic 
tonalist, it’s always his voice. 
From the bleakness of “Kaivos” 
to the sweeping drama of “Piano 
Concerto No. 1,” to his concerto 
for arctic birds, “Cantus Arcti-
cus,” Rautavaara remains Rau-
tavaara. And he will be missed.

CLASSICAL MUSIC COLUMN

Scrunchies and acid-washed 

jean jackets aren’t the only 
trends from the ’80s that are 
making their way back into 
pop culture relevancy. The Pre-
tenders, a rock band that origi-
nated in the late ’80s, have just 
released their newest album, 

Alone, and it’s a surprisingly 
prime example of why throw-
backs can sometimes work.

This album’s main strength 

comes from the fact that lead 
singer and main songwriter 
Chrissie Hynde breathed new 
life into an old label. Through a 
synergy of messy guitar chords 
and subtle hints of electronic 
influences, Alone turns your 

life into an afterschool special, 
and while not every song on this 
album upholds the same level of 
quality, they all serve to remind 
the listener that New Wave 
punk rock can still hold its own 
in today’s music world.

Alone commences on the 

titular opening track, “Alone,” 
which wastes no time in demon-
strating that the Pretenders are

ALBUM REVIEW
back and have lost none of their 
charm. This song is a strange 
conglomeration of vocals that 
are half speaking/half singing 
with upbeat, popping harmo-
nies. “Alone” is simultaneously 
both the rose and the thorns, 
with “absolutely fuck off” over 
a light background of jangling 
rhythms. Charming in the way 
it couldn’t seem to care less 
about your opinion, “Alone” 
is the perfect introduction to 
other 
songs 
in 

this 
album. 
It 

paves 
the 
road 

to songs such as 
“Roadie 
Man” 

and “Gotta Wait,” 
with 
reminders 

that the Pretend-
ers will still be 
cooler than you, no matter what 
year it is.

“Roadie Man” appears to 

draw influences from singers 
like Norah Jones. It inspires a 
Sunday morning mood through 
Hynde’s silver-tongued croon-
ing over slow and steady back-
ground melodies. This song’s 
honey-smooth finish directly 
contrasts “Gotta Wait,” which 
features choppy guitar notes 
and a driving beat. Yet, despite 
this divergence, these songs are 
constant in the fact that they 
showcase the very best of what 
the Pretenders can do with 
their well-developed sound.

Songs like “Alone,” Roadie 

Man” and “Gotta Wait” from 
Alone are very reminiscent of 
older songs like “Message of 
Love” or “Brass in Pocket.” 
They show that even after 
almost 40 years, Hynde still 
manages to uphold the mellow, 
buoyant vibes that were so icon-
ic in the ’80s.

However, as with any blast 

from the past, there runs a risk 
of over-sentimentality. Some 
songs in Alone are drawn out 

and 
excessive. 

For 
example, 

“Blue Eyed Sky” 
starts out with 
the clichéd “no 
one understands 
me” and only gets 
worse from there. 
It seems to be 

constantly reaching for some-
thing that isn’t there, which 
makes the song come across as 
empty instead of nonchalantly 
casual.

The same issue is repeated 

in “I Hate Myself.” By the third 
repetition of “I hate myself, I 
hate myself, I hate myself, I hate 
myself,” you already want the song 
to be over and by the sixth repeti-
tion the idea of repeatedly bang-
ing your head against the nearest 
table is looking more and more 
appealing. 
This 
unwarranted, 

drawn-out sappiness continues in 
“Death Is Not Enough,” complete 
with over-done comparisons and 
an achingly slow beat.

Alone starts out as a strong 

example of the immortality of 
New Wave rock but then slowly 
dissolves into a directionless, 
maudlin jumble of empty songs. 
Only the final song, “Holy Com-
motion,” redeemed the album’s 
end. Rousing and rejuvenating, 
with a snazzy electronic key-
board in the background pro-
viding a unique twist, “Holy 
Commotion” is a blend of the 
old and the new: Hynde’s time-
less voice carrying remnants 
of where the Pretenders came 
from 
while 
the 
disjointed, 

complex composition of the 
song itself carrying an omen of 
where the Pretenders can go in 
the future.

Alone is a revival of an old 

brand. The Pretenders’ old 
rhythms, tunes and harmonies 
have been recycled and upgrad-
ed, creating an unexpected 
blend of nostalgia and intrigue 
that works for a majority of the 
album. What the Pretenders 
should be wary about is becom-
ing stuck in the past and sub-
sequently creating songs that 
lose originality in their repeti-
tive 
templates 
and 
saccha-

rine sound. However, despite 
these difficulties encountered 
in Alone, it is, overall, a strong 
album. Neil Young was right; 
rock ‘n’ roll will never die, and if 
all its revivals come in the form 
of Alone, that isn’t really some-
thing to complain about.

Classifying movies as “bad” or 

“good” is hard to do. It’s difficult 
not only because movies are high-
ly subjective, indi-

but also because 
most movies don’t 
fit into a binary. 
In the era when 
opinions regarding 
every piece of pop 
culture under the 
sun litter the inter-
net, we like to decry 
movies as either being so offen-
sively horrible that they should 
never have been made in the first 
place, or seminal masterpieces too 
perfect for words. The reality is 
that most movies aren’t failures or 
masterworks — they’re just okay.

Despite this, every once in a 

while there comes a movie like 
“The Dressmaker,” which tran-
scends all these labels. Not exactly 
“bad” or “good,” it’s a profoundly 
bizarre mess of a film that’s sort of 
amazing in a “the whole is greater 
than the sum of its parts” kind of 
way, but mostly terrible in every 
other respect.

“The Dressmaker” (directed by 

Jocelyn Moorhouse) is an early 
1950s period piece that tells the 
story of Tilly Dunnage, played by 
Kate Winslet (“Steve Jobs”). Tilly, 
a glamorous and worldly fashion 
designer, returns to her home-
town, the Australian outback town 

of Dungatar, to take care of her old, 
sick mother Molly (Judy Davis, “To 
Rome With Love”). Tilly is blamed 
by the town for the death of the 
town councillor’s son, branding 
her as an outcast at the age of 10. 

Her return to Dun-
gatar 
results 
in 

shock and intrigue 
from 
the 
nosy 

townspeople. 
Til-

ly’s only allies are 
the secretly cross-
dressing chief of 
police played by 
the 
impeccably 

cast Hugo Weaving 

(“The Hobbit”) and the dashing 
young Teddy (Liam Hemsworth, 
“The Hunger Games”).

There’s plenty of good to be 

found in the movie. Winslet is an 
excellent femme fatale, and even 
though Liam Hemsworth’s char-
acter doesn’t have any defining 
traits apart from his physicality 
(also known as: abs), he rises to the 
challenge admirably. The movie 
looks very pretty, with intricate 
period costumes and a desolate 
Australian landscape. But at its 
core, this is a deeply confused 
movie — confused about what it 
wants to be and how to tell its story 
in an effective way.

“The Dressmaker” has a tone 

problem. It’s equal parts melo-
drama and black comedy, and if 
it seems like that’s an impossible 
combination to work effectively, 
that’s because it is. It wants to be 
both a sincere, devastatingly sad 

film about mob rule and a troubled 
woman who loses everything and 
a wacky adventure where death 
means little because the charac-
ters and storylines are told too car-
toonishly to elicit empathy from 
the audience. It’s audacious, but 
it doesn’t really work.The result 
is a movie that leaves the viewers 
not laughing or crying, but rather 
looking around in confusion, ask-
ing if it really just happened.

Despite all of this, “The Dress-

maker” may be one of the most 
entertaining movies I’ve seen this 
year. A character dies by jumping 
into a sorghum-filled silo to prove 
his manliness. The police chief is 
bribed into giving up confiden-
tial information about an ongoing 
investigation with a feather boa. 
A woman ruthlessly slashes her 
cheating, raping, lying husband’s 
tendons and leaves him to bleed 
to death in their spotless kitchen. 
Kate Winslet determines the out-
come of a football game by dis-
tracting the players with a bright 
red dress. Fire, Shakespeare and 
hash brownies all play key roles in 
the movie’s resolution. It’s ridicu-
lous. It’s terrible. It’s glorious.

It would be easy to say that the 

structural and tonal problems 
make this a bad movie. It would 
probably be the more respectable 
thing to say. And yet, “The Dress-
maker” defies all notions of logic 
and sound judgment. Is it bad? Is it 
good? Is it nonsense? The answer 
is yes, probably. But who cares? 
Just shut up, relax and watch.

FILM REVIEW

The simile “like a moth to a 

flame” is criminally overused 
these days. Sure, we’re all drawn 
to things that tempt us — forces 
that stick out like 
some rosy beacon 
in an otherwise 
dark night — and 
sometimes 
we 

surrender to them. 
But a true case 
of moth-to-flame 
syndrome is rare. 
And 
beautiful. 

And you can feel the heat when 
it happens.

Lady Gaga is drawn to her 

piano like a moth to a flame. 
Recall the years of bubbly, bril-
liant pop: the 2009-onward 
Renaissance of meat dresses, 
disco sticks and disconnected 
telephones. Amid this techno 
blitzkrieg, Gaga never sacri-
ficed those crystalline pipes, of 
course, and every chance she got 
she had a piano by her side.

Arguably her strongest per-

formance, the 2009 VMA rendi-
tion of “Paparazzi,” went down 
in award show history for eye 
blood, chest blood and blood, 
well, everywhere. Despite the 
hoopla, Gaga found time to visit 
her piano on stage left for the 
second verse, slam a few keys, 
then sashay her merry way. And 
so it goes for nearly every SNL 
performance since, every con-
cert and acoustic set. The New 
York doll tickles the ivories. It’s 
just what she does.

Joanne is an album of this 

stripped-down 
flame-chasing. 

Not so much a return to form 
(2013’s ARTPOP took the osten-
tatious quirk as far as it could 
go), the pink suede LP unfolds 
instead like a smooth slide into 

some dive bar in Americana 
girl-land. It’s got a mournful 
core filled with lost loves — RIP 
Taylor Kinney — yet it fights 
with a certain gritty optimism, 
as Gaga leans on friends like 
Florence Welch (“Hey Girl”) and 

fermented grapes 
(“Grigio 
Girls”) 

for strength.

An 
introspec-

tive 
search 
for 

that 
ineffable 

oomph, 
Joanne 

starts 
off 
right 

with 
the 
tingly 

“Diamond Heart.” 

Gaga hits her growl right away, 
and the drums start: “I might 
not be flawless, but you know 
I gotta diamond heart.” It’s a 
driving number with powerful 
hopefulness, which also seeps 
into the sing-song poignancy 
of “Joanne,” the title track. She 
yawps notes of liquid silver 
in this ode to herself (Gaga’s 
birth name is Stefani Joanne 
Angelina Germanotta) and her 
deceased aunt, whom she con-
siders a major influence. “Girl,” 
she sings, “where do you think 
you’re going?”

Well, the girl’s dancing “Coy-

ote Ugly”-style on the scratchy 
countertops of some Mississippi 
pub on tunes like “John Wayne” 
and “Dancin’ in Circles.” Both 
are a frenzy of sexual energy. 
The first is a catcall to all the 
badass men in the world who 
think they can handle Gaga’s 
cowboy hat and/or libido. The 
second is one of the album’s best: 
a zany, almost Rasta-like jam 
that definitely has its place in 
the Songs About Masturbation 
canon. It’s also thrillingly remi-
niscent of The Fame Monster’s 
“So Happy I Could Die,” and for 
a little bit, it feels like we’re get-
ting the old Gaga back — and an 

even better one, at that.

“Grigio Girls” keeps the spirit 

alive with a cute chorus (“All the 
Pinot, Pinot Grigio girls / Pour 
your heart out / Watch your 
blues turn gold”). “Hey Girl” 
with Florence Welch is a stel-
lar, soulful duet that feels just 
as fun and kitschy as the rest, 
though it is seared with some 
sadness, some howling. “Million 
Reasons” addresses this grief 
directly. It’s almost country-like 
in its delivery: strong “r”s, rep-
etition and attitude. But it’s a 
deftly restrained twang, evident 
on “Come To Mama” and “Sin-
ner’s Prayer,” too. Toby Keith 
ain’t that welcome in Gagatown.

It’s easy to forget about the 

cathartic “Angel Down;” the 
ballad strove for anthemic but 
got its less-hot cousin, aimless-
ness. Joanne’s promotional sin-
gles also plummet into nowhere 
land: “AYO” is a schmaltzy, 
almost Disney Channel-esque 
pop tune lacking the fine-wine 
finesse brought about by Gaga’s 
many years in the business. 
“Perfect Illusion” is equally 
as formulaic — it builds, but it 
builds modern songwriting cli-
ché after cliché. This is the first 
time producer Mark Ronson has 
let our ears down, it seems.

But the final song, “Just 

Another Day,” turns it around. 
Sure, it’s a little cheesy, but 
Gaga’s been a little cheesy all 
along — a self-aware flair for 
dramatics that even permeates 
her songs about the mundanity 
of everyday life. “Just Another 
Day” is just another day. But 
that’s a damn good day if we 
have Gaga back by the piano 
churning out songs again, belt-
ing red velvet melodies that emit 
the warmth that first drew us to 
her — our tricky, inextinguish-
able flame of a woman.

ALBUM REVIEW

MELINA GLUSAC

Senior Arts Edior

I wish I could say that in 

“Chance,” a new drama from 
Hulu, Hugh Laurie plays the 
same kind of sex-
ily 
disillusioned 

doctor who dead-
pans 
his 
way 

through an epi-
sode that he did 
in “House,” but 
I 
can’t. 
While 

his voice sounds 
exactly the same, 
his serious face is only slight-
ly grayer than it had been in 
“House” and the pilot is just as 
full of medical jargon, “Chance” 
is missing a few of the key com-
ponents that allowed “House” to 
run for eight seasons. The com-
parisons, though perhaps unfair, 
are inevitable.

Based on a book by the mys-

tery writer Kem Nunn and set 
in San Francisco, “Chance” fol-
lows Eldon Chance, a puppy dog-
eyed dad in the middle of divorce 
who can’t pay for his daughter’s 
private school. He’s a practicing 
neuropsychiatrist who writes 
reports but doesn’t treat the 
patients himself, and there are 
voiceover segments throughout 
the pilot in which Laurie reads 
over those reports. His disen-

chantment with his job — he 
feels like he can’t help people in 
a real way — provides the dreary 
framework for the first main plot 
device.

Chance appears to take only 

a 
cursory 
inter-

est in his patients, 
until 
in 
walks 

Jaclyn 
Black-

stone 
(Gretchen 

Mol, 
“Boardwalk 

Empire”), 
whose 

medical complaints 
are not as alarming 
as her confession 

of a police husband who hits her. 
Chance — of course despite his 
own better judgment and the 
judgment of his partner — gets 
too involved. This is complicated 
by Blackstone’s apparent two 
warring personalities.

Then there’s a slightly confus-

ing subplot, concerning a desk 
that Chance is trying to sell at 
an obscenely, fraudulently high 
price. This allows for the intro-
duction of two characters, an 
antiques dealer (Clark Peters, 
“The Wire”) and D (Ethan 
Suplee, “My Name is Earl”).

D, who becomes something 

of a sidekick to Chance, helps 
him stake out Blackstone’s hus-
band. There are opportunities 
for 
unconventionally 
darker 

buddy humor here that could 

and should be developed, as it 
would let Laurie’s comedic skills 
shine through the cracks of this 
glum plot — but the show seems 
hesitant to give up the tenuous, 
barely-there noir elements and 
somber atmosphere that prevent 
opportunities for lighter comedy.

Which is a shame, because 

while Eldon Chance might have 
the same tortured, soulful eyes 
that House did, he is missing 
House’s sardonic and apathetic 
sense of humour — the one thing 
that made the character digest-
ible, 
despite 
the 
sometimes 

shocking callousness.

The 
real 
plot 
points 
of 

“Chance” are slow to be mapped 
out, though the clichés roll out 
quickly — the tortured doctor 
who gets too involved in one 
damsel in distress, ignoring his 
marital and financial problems 
for her sake; an illicit café meet-
ing and alley brawl, blah blah 
blah.

“Chance” ’s supporting actors 

do their best with what they’re 
given, but it isn’t enough to 
compensate for the bewilder-
ingly slow pace and lack of driv-
ing energy. Even the haunting 
piano notes of the score feel flat. 
Laurie’s performance is still the 
strongest part of this show; he 
almost makes middle-aged adult 
angst intriguing. Almost.

‘M’ seeks to exorcise demons in East Lansing

Just 12 months ago, as an 

announced 
crowd 
of 
111,740 

filed out of Michigan Stadium 
in utter silence after one of the 
most shocking finishes in college 
football history, it would have 
been hard to imagine Michigan 
and Michigan State lining up 
again Saturday in their current 
positions only one year later.

The 
second-ranked 

Wolverines are 7-0 and in the 
driver’s seat in the Big Ten race, 
while the Spartans are 2-5 and 
three-touchdown 
underdogs. 

The Wolverines have the College 
Football Playoff in their sights. 
The Spartans have only a bowl 
berth to play for.

That, and an eighth win in nine 

years against Michigan.

says 
nearly 
every 

week that the upcoming game 
is a championship game. This is 
the first one — though likely not 
the last — that really is. The two 
teams typically play for the de 
facto state championship. The 
Wolverines have not brought 
home the Paul Bunyan Trophy 
since 2012, an important factor 
even to those new to the rivalry.

“I can tell it’s Michigan State 

week — I know that,” said first-
year defensive coordinator Don 
Brown. 
“Obviously 
my 
first 

experience, so I’m kind of feeding 
off my guys. … It’s the same, for 
us, in terms of the preparation. 
I get a sense from our guys that 
it’s a little bit more important. 
There’s no question about it.”

More than just last year — 

when Michigan State picked up a 
fumbled punt snap and returned 
it for a game-winning touchdown 
on the last play — the Spartans 
have owned the edge lately. They 
outscored Michigan, 64-17, at 
home in 2013 and 2014, in two 
games Michigan’s players said 
were even more embarrassing 

than last year’s.

Michigan State coach Mark 

Dantonio is 7-2 in the game he 
has placed utmost importance 
on during his tenure, and with 
most of the Spartans’ season a 
disappointment to this point, they 
surely would love nothing more 
than to spoil the Wolverines’ 
season with a fifth straight home 
win in the series.

“I think they love beating us 

more than any other team in the 
country, and for fair reasons,” said 
fifth-year senior offensive tackle 
Erik Magnuson. “I remember 
it being hostile. … When you go 
there and all the fans are flipping 
you off and all that type of stuff 
when you’re pulling in, you kind 
of realize it’s a big deal.”

In the teams’ last meeting at 

Spartan Stadium, then-No. 8 
Michigan State pounded a reeling 
Michigan team, 35-11. Wolverines 
linebacker Joe Bolden drove 
a stake into the field before 
the game, and the Spartans 
responded by tacking on another 
touchdown late in the game. 
Michigan State went on to beat 
Baylor in the Cotton Bowl, and 
Michigan finished 5-7 and fired 
coach Brady Hoke.

It was hard to imagine then, 

or even after last year’s stunner, 
that the teams’ fortunes would 
reverse so quickly. Following the 
2015 loss, Michigan could only 
talk about how it would recover 
from that, how it would “put steel 
in the spine.”

“Coach Harbaugh also talked 

about, 
‘We’re 
gonna 
handle 

this better than any team could 
ever handle it,’” said senior 
cornerback Jourdan Lewis. “He 
was right — we just go on and play 
the remainder of our games, and 
looking to this year, we just try to 
go out there and execute in East 
Lansing.”

The Wolverines have lost only 

once since then, against Ohio 
State last November at Michigan 
Stadium. 
They 
watched 
the 

Spartans move on from that game 
to a Big Ten Championship and 
an appearance in the College 
Football Playoff, capping one of 
the most successful runs in school 
history. Even while focusing on 
the present, the Wolverines say 
they won’t forget about their 
struggles against their in-state 
rival.

“What we’ve got going now is 

special,” said redshirt sophomore 
quarterback Wilton Speight. “If 
we take our foot off the gas, that 
feeling will go away.”

Now, Michigan State is on 

an entirely different trajectory. 
The Spartans have lost five 
straight games, the first against 
Wisconsin on Sept. 24, the last 
at Maryland on Saturday. In 

between, they fell to Indiana in 
overtime and gave up 54 points to 
Northwestern. They have not yet 
found reliable quarterback play 
between Tyler O’Connor, Damion 
Terry and Brian Lewerke.

That’s a bad recipe against 

Michigan’s top-ranked defense, 
which has playmakers all over 
the field: fifth-year senior Chris 
Wormley 
and 
senior 
Taco 

Charlton (four sacks each) on 
the 
defensive 
line, 
redshirt 

sophomore Jabrill Peppers (10 
tackles for loss) at linebacker and 
the All-American Lewis in the 
secondary.

The Wolverines had all of 

those players in starring roles 
last season, when they appeared 
poised to exorcise their demons 

against Michigan State, end their 
losing streak in the series and 
gain the inside track to the Big 
Ten championship.

This year, the demons are 

back and all of those goals are 
still in play, but with higher 
stakes. For the first time since 
that 
“embarrassment” 
in 

2014, for the third time in four 
years, for the first time under 
Harbaugh, Michigan is heading 
up to East Lansing to try to win a 
championship game.

“That’s all I want to think 

about — I don’t want to think 
about the other way,” Magnuson 
said. “I can only imagine us 
driving home with Paul Bunyan 
on our side, because that’s what 
we’re going in there to do.”

What to watch for: Will Spartans throw at Lewis?

The No. 2 Michigan football 

team’s matchup with Michigan 
State 
in 
East 
Lansing 
this 

weekend won’t be the top-10 
showdown some fans thought it 
might be before the season, but 
that certainly doesn’t mean it 
won’t be worth watching.

It’s cliché to say that records 

are thrown out the window in 
rivalry games, but this rivalry 
in particular has proven that to 
be true. From the “Clockgate” 
game of 2001 to Braylon Edwards’ 
three-touchdown 
performance 

in 2004 to Chad Henne’s fouth-
quarter comeback in 2007 to 
Blake O’Neill’s dropped punt 
last season, the Wolverines and 
the Spartans have proven that 
anything can happen when they 
face off.

It might be unrealistic to 

expect much drama this year, 
though — behind the nation’s top 
defense, Michigan (4-0 Big Ten, 
7-0 overall) has its sights set on 
the College Football Playoff, while 
Michigan State (0-4, 2-5) has 
dropped five games in a row for 
the first time since 1991. Despite 
being on the road, the Wolverines 
are favored by more than three 
touchdowns, one of the largest 
spreads in the rivalry’s recent 
history.

The Spartans may not have the 

pieces to turn Saturday’s game 
into another instant classic, but 
here are a few things to watch for 
when the in-state rivals square 
off.

1. Who wins the battle in the 

trenches?

There have been plenty of 

flashy moments throughout the 
rivalry, but nearly every game 
has been won on the ground. The 
team with the most rushing yards 
has won 42 of the last 46 meetings, 

making the battle in the trenches 
extremely important. Michigan 
State has won seven of the last 
eight 
meetings 
between 
the 

teams, in large part because of its 
talented offensive and defensive 
lines. The low point for Michigan 
came in 2013, when the Spartans 
sacked 
quarterback 
Devin 

Gardner seven times and left the 
Wolverines with a program-low 
negative-48 rushing yards.

This year, though, the roles 

could be reversed. Michigan State 
lost three offensive linemen and 
defensive end Shilique Calhoun 
to the NFL Draft in April, while 
Michigan boasts two of the 
most experienced offensive and 
defensive lines in the country. 
The Spartans still have plenty 
of talent on their roster, starting 
with a potential first-round draft 
pick in defensive lineman Malik 
McDowell, but they haven’t 
produced so far this season. 
They’ll need to take a huge step 
forward to stop the Wolverines.

2. 
Will 
Michigan 
State 

quarterbacks throw at Jourdan 
Lewis?

Partially due to Michigan’s 

outstanding pass defense and 
partially due to Lewis’ All-
American reputation, the senior 
cornerback has only been targeted 
about once a game since returning 
from injury. Lewis admitted he’s 
a little frustrated by the light 
workload, but he’s feeling as fresh 
as he’s ever felt this late in a season 
before.

Last 
year, 
though, 
the 

Spartans were one of the rare 
teams to repeatedly go after 
Lewis. 
Quarterback 
Connor 

Cook 
targeted 
Lewis’ 
man, 

wide receiver Aaron Burbridge, 
19 times throughout the game. 
Lewis and Burbridge essentially 
battled to a draw — Burbridge had 
nine receptions for 132 yards, but 
Lewis had seven tackles and six 

pass breakups.

Things might be different this 

year, though, with both Cook and 
Burbridge in the NFL. Michigan 
State 
has 
struggled 
to 
get 

consistent play from quarterbacks 
Tyler 
O’Connor 
and 
Brian 

Lewerke, but it does boast talented 
wide receivers like R.J. Shelton 
and Donnie Corley. We’ll find out 
Saturday if coach Mark Dantonio 
trusts any of those players enough 
to challenge Lewis again.

3. How will the Wolverines 

use Jabrill Peppers?

Peppers has played over a dozen 

positions this season, but the 
redshirt sophomore linebacker 
has hinted that he has a few more 
tricks up his sleeve that Michigan 
hasn’t shown yet. His minutes on 
offense have drastically increased 
since Big Ten play started — he 

has seen consistent reps at wildcat 
quarterback or running back, 
both early in the game and when 
the score has already gotten out of 
hand.

Illinois did a surprisingly 

good job holding Peppers in 
check last week, as he picked up 
just nine yards on five carries. 
Most of his plays were obvious 
designed runs, though, and it’s 
likely that Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh will be a little more 
creative this week. Peppers says 
he can throw the ball 65 yards — 
will we see him attempt a pass 
this weekend? Will he score a 
touchdown on a trick play we 
haven’t seen yet? Will he kick a 
45-yard field goal?

All possibilities are on the table. 

Except probably that last one.

4. Will Harbaugh run up the 

score if Michigan leads big?

Harbaugh has already shown 

that he has no mercy in blowouts 
— the Wolverines inexplicably 
went for two at Rutgers to run 
the score to 29-0. Though he 
has shown nothing but respect 
for Dantonio this week, praising 
the job he has done at Michigan 
State, Harbaugh might have a 
chance to make a statement if 
things get out of hand Saturday 
afternoon.

Given the way that last year’s 

game ended — with Dantonio 
being captured on video asking 
fans 
at 
Michigan 
Stadium, 

“Where’d all those Wolverines 
go?” after the victory — and the 
fact that Dantonio offered some 
veiled criticisms of Harbaugh’s 
satellite camps over the summer, 
let’s just say we wouldn’t be 
surprised if Harbaugh fired one 
of his infamous “shots over the 
bow.”

Wolverines seek to remedy offensive woes

It was back to basics this 

week in practice for the No. 11 
Michigan hockey team.

The 
Wolverines 
(3-1-1) 

escaped last Saturday’s game 
against Michigan Tech with a 
tie despite being outplayed and 
outshot by the Huskies, 45-18.

As Michigan prepared for 

a road series against Vermont 
and Dartmouth this upcoming 
weekend, 
it 
returned 
to 

the methods that had been 
successful in the past, such as 
sharpening up its “systems of 
play” and its offense with and 
without the puck.

“We just feel we were on our 

heels last weekend and never 
really got going,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “That’s 
been a little bit of the story in 
every game. We just thought 
our team had to work harder 
in practice. We have to work 
harder in every drill, our effort 
and execution had to be better 
this week, and I think it is.”

Added 
senior 
defenseman 

Nolan De Jong: “There’s a 
few things we had to tidy up, 
whether it was our entries and 
our decision-making, but also 
some of the stuff around the net, 
whether it’s the offensive zone 
or the defensive zone. But I think 
we’ve had a really good week of 
practice so far and the coaches 
seem pretty happy with it, so 
I think we’re ready to go, and 
we’re excited to get to Vermont 
and get things going again.”

Michigan has been outshot 

in every game this season, 
but according to De Jong, 
improvement can be made by 
limiting the quality of scoring 
opportunities 
opponents 

generate, 
rather 
than 
just 

limiting the total number of 
shots. He believes the teams 
the Wolverines have played 
this year “kinda throw pucks in 
everywhere.”

For 
Michigan, 
it 
comes 

down to reducing the number 
of 
Grade-A 
chances 
that 

opponents receive, whether it’s 
by making sure everyone on 
the ice picks up their defensive 

assignment or boxes out hard in 
front of the net.

The Wolverines have also 

been practicing their offensive 
game. Michigan has struggled 
to sustain a consistent even-man 
attack recently, something its 
coach attributes to sloppiness 
with and without the puck.

“If you’re going to pass me 

the puck, give it to me on my 
stick, not at my feet or not up 
here where I have to catch 
it,” Berenson said. “Give me 
a signature pass, and then I’ll 
take it, handle it and I can pass 
it to him. You give me a bad 
pass, (and) I’ll never get it away 
to him. I’ll be on my ass because 
you gave me a bad pass.

“So little things like our 

passing (and) our play without 
the puck (have) to be better. We 
have to be more dialed-in in our 
zone — we were circling away 
instead of playing the man or 

getting our stick on the puck. 
We were getting outmuscled 
and outhustled on the puck. 
We can’t play like that and win 
games.”

With a home series against 

No. 4 Boston looming in just 
two weeks, Michigan will look 
to fine-tune its offensive and 
defensive play this weekend in 
two games the Wolverines are 
favored to win.

The 
Catamounts 
finished 

15-22-3 last season and are off 
to a 2-1-1 start this year, while 
the Big Green finished 18-16-
1 in the ECAC last season and 
have yet to play a regular season 
game this year.

And 
while 
Michigan 
is 

one of the youngest teams 
in the nation, Vermont and 
Dartmouth aren’t far behind 
— the Catamounts have nine 
freshmen on their roster, while 
the Big Green have 11.

It will be a good chance 

for the Wolverines to clean 
up their play before entering 
the bulk of their schedule. 
That opportunity isn’t lost on 
Berenson, who hopes to see 
specific 
improvements 
from 

his team against Vermont and 
Dartmouth this weekend.

“We’re looking for better 

zone play in the offensive 
zone and more puck control, 
and we’re looking to get out of 
our zone quicker,” Berenson 
said. “We can’t be stuck in our 
zone for a minute at a time and 
then hope that the other team 
doesn’t score. We’ve got to get 
the puck out quicker, we’ve 
got to do better with it in their 
zone and then little parts of 
the game, like faceoffs have to 
be better, blocked shots. Our 
power play and penalty killing 
are still pretty good right now, 
but they can be better.”

The Michigan hockey team has only lost once this season, but the Wolverines have been consistently outshot.

Behind enemy lines 
with Riley Bullough

Michigan 
State 
linebacker 

Riley Bullough has captured the 
attention of his in-state rivals, 
specifically redshirt sophomore 
quarterback Wilton Speight.

“They’ve got a bunch of good 

guys in the box, with their 
leader Riley Bullough,” Speight 
said Tuesday. “That dude is an 
angry guy. He wants to get in the 
quarterback’s kitchen on every 
play, so I know I have to get the 
ball out as quickly as possible.”

Being from Traverse City, 

Mich., Bullough is no stranger to 
the in-state rivalry. His brother, 
Max, was also a linebacker for the 
Spartans and currently plays in 
the National Football League for 
the Houston Texans.

Bullough was recently ejected 

for targeting in the first quarter 
of the Spartans’ matchup with 
Maryland, but because the call 
was made in the first half, he’ll be 
eligible to play against Michigan.

In four games this season, he 

has 26 tackles and four for loss. He 
was out for three straight games 
due to injury earlier this season.

The Daily talked with Bullough 

at Big Ten Media Days in July to 
discuss the rivalry, what it takes 
to be successful in the Big Ten 
and his cross-country-star sister, 
Holly Bullough.

The Michigan Daily: So the 

talk is that your sister is the best 
athlete in the family?

Riley 
Bullough: 
Yeah, 
it 

always is. But she really is, she’s 
special. She’s coming here to run 

track and cross country so she’ll 
be (in East Lansing) in August. 
So it’s exciting for her, but yeah, 
she’s a freak athlete. She works 
out like three times a day and eats 
insanely healthy, so she probably 
is the best athlete.

Q: Does this team relish when 

people 
— 
opponents, 
media, 

whoever — overlooks them a little 
bit?

RB: Yeah, at this point, I feel 

like it’s part of our identity. I feel 
like every year, there’s people 
doubting us. But I guess we like 
it, because we seem to play pretty 
well. That’s just what we plan on 
doing again this year.

Q: Was it tough being Max’s 

little brother?

RB: It was a lot of fun. We had 

fun growing up. But him coming 
here and doing the things that he 
did — I wouldn’t say it was tough, 
it just put the expectations that 
much higher. I was expected to 
do what he did and more, so I just 
kinda cherished that and relished 
that.

Q: With the way that the 

MSU-U of M game ended last 
year, does that even take the 
intensity up a notch, not that it 
needs it?

RB: I think for sure. I’m sure 

they think that we kinda stole that 
game from them. But that rivalry 
every year is huge, especially if 
you grew up in Michigan. You’re 
either the team down the road or 
you’re Michigan State. There’s 
no in-between, so that’s just kind 
of how it is, and I think that’s the 
way it should be.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

Riley Bullough (30) spoke with the Daily at Big Ten Media Days in July.

Breakdown: Michigan’s ‘D’ has edge

Prior to the start of the season, 

this Saturday’s contest between 
Michigan and Michigan State was 
expected to be one of the defining 
games of Big Ten play.

Oh, how things have changed. 

The Spartans have lost their last 
five games and sit at 2-5 on the 
season. They are now fighting 
an uphill battle to become bowl-
eligible.

The Wolverines, meanwhile, 

are 7-0, ranked No. 2 in the country 
and very much in the hunt for the 
College Football Playoff.

But even with the stark contrast 

in the directions their seasons 
have taken, nothing is predictable 
when these two teams meet. The 
Daily broke down what to expect 
when they take the field:

Michigan pass offense vs. 

Michigan State pass defense

Here’s 
guessing 
Michigan 

throws for about 225 yards against 
the Spartans. 

Through seven games, the 

Wolverines are averaging 225.9 
yards 
through 
the 
air, 
and 

Michigan State is giving up 
225.4. It’s probably unlikely those 
numbers will hold exactly, but hey, 
we might as well have fun with 
this statistical coincidence.

In non-numerical analysis, the 

Wolverines are hoping redshirt 
sophomore quarterback Wilton 
Speight can build on what may 
have been his best start of the year 
against Illinois. Speight completed 
16 of 23 passes for 253 yards and 
two touchdowns. Against the 
Spartans, he faces a unit that has 
certainly had its ups and downs.

Two weeks ago, it allowed 

Northwestern 
quarterback 

Clayton Thorson to throw for 283 
yards and three touchdowns in a 
54-40 loss. The week before that, 
Michigan State held BYU standout 
Taysom Hill to just 138 yards 
passing.

The defense that shows up 

against the Wolverines could 
make the difference in deciding 
whether Michigan throws for 
225.4 or 225.9 yards.

Edge: PUSH

Michigan rush offense vs. 

Michigan State rush defense

This matchup should be a little 

more clear-cut. Michigan boasts 
the nation’s 11th-ranked rush 
offense and comfortably rotates 
four backs to do its damage. The 
Wolverines could be without 
freshman 
Chris 
Evans, 
who 

sustained a concussion against the 
Fighting Illini, but depth should 
not be a concern.

Sophomore running back Karan 

Higdon continues to put together 
a breakout season with 214 yards 
and three touchdowns in his last 
two games, and senior De’Veon 
Smith is still his usual workhorse 
self. Redshirt junior Ty Isaac has 
seen an increased role this season, 
too, and could get even more reps if 
Evans can’t play.

And 
then 
there’s 
the 

Hammering 
Panda. 
Redshirt 

junior fullback Khalid Hill has 
been a force at the goal line this 
season for Michigan, and he has 
the stat line to prove it. Hill has 
25 yards rushing on 15 attempts, 
but more than half of them 
(eight) are touchdowns. He also 
caught a touchdown this season, 
which likely makes him the most 
productive fullback in the country.

Michigan State, meanwhile, 

is having a down year in rush 
defense, and it’s 66th-ranked unit 
will likely have its hands full all 
game against an offense that has 
proven a commitment to smash-
mouth football.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan State pass offense 

vs. Michigan pass defense

The big question is who starts 

at quarterback for the Spartans. 
Redshirt freshman Brian Lewerke 
started in their 28-17 loss to 

Maryland last week, but senior 
quarterback Tyler O’Connor is 
still an option after he missed last 
week’s game with an injury.

But whoever it is, he won’t be 

in for a fun day. Michigan’s pass 
defense is currently giving up 
the fewest yards in the nation, 
and its cornerbacks are playing 
at a truly elite level. According 
to Pro Football Focus College, 
opponents are 11-for-39 for 131 
yards, zero touchdowns and four 
interceptions while throwing at 
them.

Michigan 
State’s 
receiving 

corps is strong with players like 
R.J. Shelton and Donnie Corley, but 
even they likely won’t be enough to 
overcome the Wolverines’ stingy 
secondary.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan State rush offense 

vs. Michigan rush defense

It doesn’t get any easier for 

Michigan 
State’s 
offense 
on 

the 
ground. 
The 
Wolverines 

are giving up just 96 yards on 
the ground per game this year, 
good for fourth-best nationally. 
The Spartans, meanwhile, are 
averaging a modest 155.29 yards 
a game.

Michigan’s 63 tackles for loss 

are also fourth-most in the nation, 
which doesn’t bode well for an 
offense that will already have to be 
cautious in the passing game. L.J. 
Scott has carried the load for the 
Spartans early in the year, racking 
up 464 yards on 93 carries, and 
Gerald Holmes has tacked on 272 
of his own. But against Michigan, 
it’s a whole different challenge. 
The Wolverines rotate two full 
defensive lines, keeping them 
fresh for constant pursuit in the 
offensive backfield.

If Scott gets hot, Michigan 

State could have a real chance on 
Saturday. If he doesn’t, it could get 
ugly.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

The Wolverines have had some 

notable struggles in the kicking 
game, but Saturday, all eyes will be 
on the punter.

Fifth-year senior Kenny Allen 

is averaging 42.3 yards per punt, 
and he has consistently given the 
Wolverines strong field position. 
But 
after 
Michigan 
State’s 

unforgettable botched-punt return 
touchdown to snatch victory at the 
end of last season’s meeting, Allen 
just needs to keep special teams 
mistakes to a minimum.

The 
Wolverines 
rank 
14th 

in the country in special teams 
efficiency, compared to 70th for 
the Spartans. Sophomore Tyree 
Kinnel has developed a penchant 
for altering punts, and redshirt 
sophomore Jabrill Peppers is the 
ultimate weapon on returns.

Michigan will need Allen to be 

solid kicking field goals, but as long 
as the Wolverines can avoid major 
mistakes, they should be in good 
shape against an average unit on 
the other side.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles: 

The Wolverines say they’ll treat 

Saturday like a championship 
game, but that’s how they say they 
treat every game. To the Spartans, 
this game could salvage their 
season.

Michigan State sits at 2-5, and 

without a win Saturday, the season 
can’t be considered anything other 
than a disappointment for a team 
coming off a College Football 
Playoff appearance. For Michigan, 
a loss could have dire playoff 
ramifications.

And while the Wolverines 

will no doubt be out for revenge, 
the Spartans will be absolutely 
desperate to snap their losing 
streak and spoil a potentially 
special season for their rival.

Edge: Michigan State

Prediction: 
Michigan 
31, 

Michigan State 9
