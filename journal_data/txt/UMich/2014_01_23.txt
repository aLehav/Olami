Despite the low prices,
business managers say
exposure brings in a
new clientele
By CHRISTY SONG
Daily StaffReporter
On a typical day, Asian sea bass at
Main Street's Mdlange costs a cool
$29. The Restaurant Week special,
though, was $28 and included three
courses.
It's natural to assume that such low
prices would discourage restaurants
to participate in Restaurant Week,
and Laura Wanke, general manager
and owner of Melange, confirmed
she experienced a slight dip in prof-
its. However, she said the huge wave
of customers makes Restaurant Week
an advantageous marketing tool for
attracting a new clientele.
"We're going to take the increased
volume for that one week definitely
over the reduced profitability,"Wanke
said.

The weeks following the holiday
season in January are often tough for
restaurants; customers' wallets and
waistlines have to recover from pres-
ent shopping and Christmas cookie-
munching.
Gratzi manager Luke Magnini said
Restaurant Week gives the establish-
ment a boost it typically doesn't expe-
rience this time of year. He added that
restaurants rarely see many custom-
ers in early January, as most restau-
rant-goers are recovering from the
holidays.
"It's not that much of a difference
as far as revenue wise per person, but
it's a great boost to get people in as in
otherwise would normally be a slow
week for us," he said.
Other restaurants affirmed that the
publicity and low-prices of Restaurant
Week pleases both regular and first-
time guests. Magnini said Restaurant
Week goers often become long-term
guests.
"We find a lot of guests that have
become regulars and this is kind of
their week to explore and to see a lot
of the new restaurants, but also to

Regents discuss
digital education,

By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily NewsEditor
For centuries, scores of
immigrants, writers, art-
ists and entrepreneurs have

journeyed to New York City
in search of opportunity or
inspiration.
Hoping to draw their own
insights from a selection of the
East Coast's premier academic
institutions, the University's
Board of Regents gathered in
New York City late last week
to discuss a range of topics,
including the future of aca-
demic health centers and digi-

tal education.
The sessions, which were
closed to the public, were
held in place of the board's
regularly scheduled monthly
meeting. This is the second
time this board has opted for
an out-of-state, January trip.
Last year, the regents flew
to Los Angeles to meet with
leaders from Google, Stanford
University and University of

California-Berkeley.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily before the
trip, University President
Mary Sue Coleman said the
excursion provides a time for
the regents to get out of their
normal environment and
think broadly about issues fac-
inginstitutions of higher edu-
cation.

Washtenaw Health
Initiative recruits
garner sign-ups for
insurance plans
ByAMABEL KAROUB
DailyStaffReporter
As the end of open enroll-
ment for health insurance
under the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act draws
near, University students are
reaching out to ensure that the
public is educated about their
options under the new law.
The Washtenaw Health Ini-
tiative has recruited nearly 70
University students who are
nowworking around the coun-
ty to educate low-income indi-
viduals about the ACA. Their
mission: encourage the unin-
sured to come to hospitals, like
University of Michigan Health
System, where employees are
on call to help people enroll.
HealthCare.gov -the nation-
al public exchange program for
health insurance providers -
has anongoing open enrollment

periodallowingnew customers
to register for health insurance
from last October until March
31 of this year.
While approximately 75,000
Michiganders have signed up
for coverage under the new
laws, there are thousands more
who desperately need health
insurance, and do not know
how ACA works and what kind
of benefits they can recieve.
WHI project manager Car-
rie Rheingans said students
are looking to educate those
who believe they cannot afford
health insurance under the new
act.
"The biggest hurdle that peo-
ple have is that they still think
it's going to be expensive,"
Rheingans said. "Historically,
insurance has been expensive,
that's why people didn't get it.
But they don't know about all of
the tax credits and other assis-
tance that is available until they
go on there and enter their own
personal information."
While misconceptions about
expense are one reason why

New findings
suggest they exist
in transition states
By KAITLIN ZURDOSKY
Daily StaffReporter
Researchers at the Univer-
sity's Comprehensive Cancer
Center, in collaboration with

an international cohort, have
developed means of identifying
two states of breast cancer stem
cells, giving them new clues as
to how to treat patients with
cancer.
By distinguishing the dif-
ferent states, they hope to find
more targeted and effective
treatments for the disease,
which kills over 40,000 people
each year in the U.S., according

to the American Cancer Soci-
ety.
"What we found is that the
stem cells actually are like cha-
meleons - that is they can exist
in two different states," said

of Oncology and director of the
University of Michigan Com-
prehensive Cancer Center.

Money dependent on
larger deal's success,
will be paid over
next 20 years
LANSING, Mich. (AP) -
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder is
pledging to commit up to $350
million in state funds to help
Detroit as the bankrupt city tries
to shore up pension funds that
are billions in debt and prevent
valuable city-owned art from
beingsold.
The Republican joined legis-
lative leaders on Wednesday tot
announce a proposal that would
provide the money over 20 years,
as long as a larger settlement
is reached with labor unions
and city workers concerned
about pensions. The lawmakers
acknowledged the plan may be a
hard sell in the GOP-controlled
Legislature, but they said it was
better than a protracted legal
fight in a city facing an estimated
$18 billion in debt.
The governor was quick to say
the money wouldn't be a bailout,
but rather a way to help Detroit
quickly settle its bankruptcy and
allow it to grow. He also noted
the plan follows roughly $330
million that has been pledged
so far by charitable foundations,
largely in exchange for protect-
ing works at the Detroit Institute
of Arts that might otherwise be
sold during bankruptcy.
"If Michigan's to be a great
state again, we need Detroit on a
positive path to success," Snyder
said.
Snyder had initially warned
Detroit not to expect any state
money when the city filed for
bankruptcy, a move he support-
ed. What changed, he said, were
mediators "doing good work" to
bring the foundations and state
together to help.
He noted that the money
would either be diverted from
tobacco settlement funds that
Michigan receives each year or
come from securitizing future

payments to get a lump sum up
front.
Snyder said the state aid
would help minimize cuts to city
retirees' pensions, particularly
those with low incomes, but he
declined to detail the impact for
all 21,000 current retirees. He
said details would come when
the city's state-appointed emer-
gency manager, Kevin Orr, filed
his plan to take Detroit out of
bankruptcy with the courts. That
filing is due by March 1.
Before Wednesday, the gover-
nor had been largely mum about
any potential state aid, partly
because discussions between the
city and its creditors with federal
mediators are private.
Snyder had privately gauged
support among lawmakers last
week for the plan - and he is fac-
ing politically tricky terrain.
Some legislators are worried
that state financial assistance to
Detroit could set a precedent if
other cities collapse, while oth-
ers have said they have their own
spending priorities elsewhere in
the state. Election-year politick-
ing also could come into play,
as some GOP lawmakers blame
many of the city's more recent
problems on a corrupt political
culture in Detroit, where Demo-
crats rein.
In Snyder's corner, however,
are top Republican and Demo-
cratic leaders who agree it would
be better to help resolve the
bankruptcy now.
Republican Senate Majority
Leader Randy Richardville, who
is from Monroe in the southeast
corner of Michigan, said the
proposal was "very positive, and
in general is being received that
way."
GOP House Speaker Jase Bol-
ger, from Marshall in the south-
central part of the state, said
winning approval for the plan
"won't be easy." But he said law-
makers need to consider that
Detroit could either be rebound-
ing in a year or "still mired in
bankruptcy, dragging down the
full state, asthe worldsees Detroit
when they think of Michigan."

Orr, who was appointed by
Snyder to take over the citys
finances, has said two pension
funds are underfunded by $3.5
billion. A deal involving the state
and foundations - bringing out-
side aide to roughly $700 mil-
lion - would help retirees but
probably not cover all of their
pensions.
"We now have an unprec-
edented commitment of public
and private resources to help the
city of Detroit fulfill its commit-
ments to retirees and preserve
one if its cultural jewels, the
Detroit Institute of Arts," Orr
said in a statement.
Orr's spokesman, Bill Nowl-
ing, said the plan announced
Wednesday was "huge" but that
challenges remain.
"Nothing is certain in a bank-
ruptcy until a bankruptcy judge
tells you it is and an appeals court
affirms it," Nowling said.
Asked how the money could
be earmarked for pensions when
other creditors might want it,
Snyder told The Associated Press
that the state and charitable dol-
lars amounted to incremental
resources that, if no bankruptcy
settlement is reached, "won't be
available."
But the plan has its critics.
Steve Spencer, financial adviser
to one of the city's creditors,
Financial Guaranty Insurance
Co., said it conflicts with the
long-term interests of Detroit
and its creditors.
"We find it incredible that
the city is being allowed to
leave such a valuable art col-
lection untouched when it can't
provide basic services and is
proposing to essentially walk
away from its debt obligations,"
Spencer said.
Meanwhile, the judge han-
dling the city's bankruptcy, Ste-
ven Rhodes, reminded lawyers
during a hearing Wednesday that
the clock was ticking toward a
March 1 deadline for abroad plan
to bring Detroit out of bankrupt-
cy. In his strongest words yet, he
urged the city and creditors to
keep negotiating.

BOARD
From Page 1A
Members of the board were joined
by Coleman; Provost Martha Pollack;
Tim Slottow, executive vice president
and chief financial officer and Sally
Churchill, vice president and secretary.
Ora Pescovitz, executive vice presi-
dent for medical affairs and University
Health System chief executive officer;
E. Royster Harper, vice president for
student life and Jerry May, vice presi-
dent for development also contributed to
some of the sessions.
Leaders in higher education on the
East Coast facilitated sessions in New
York with the University's attendees.
These leaders included Bill Bowen,
Princeton University president emeri-
tus; Peter Salovey, president of Yale
University; Edward Miller, retired exec-
utive vice president for medical affairs
at Johns Hopkins University and Mike
Johns, retired executive vice president
for health affairs at Emory University.
In addition to these sessions, the
board attended two development events,
one at Lincoln Center and a breakfast
Friday morning designed to engage
younger alumni. Both were paid for by
Office of Development funds, totaling
about $90,000, according to University
spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald.
Bowen led the regents in a session
centered on digital learning -which was
one of the chieftalkingpoints duringthe
California trip last year as well.
In an interview with the Daily, Bowen
said institutions like the University
should not be concerned with online
courses - like Massive Open Online
Courses - threatening traditional resi-
dential approaches to higher education.
"The situation is very different at a
place like the University of Michigan,"
Bowen said. "Michigan is going to be just
fine whatever they do or don't do in this
area over the few years. I have no doubt
about that."
Bowen, who co-authored "Cross-
ing the Finish Line: Completing Col-
lege at America's Public Universities,"
said online courses have the potential
to increase college completion rates
and decrease the time it takes to earn a
degree. However, Bowen said the ben-
efits of online courses might be greater

for institutions struggling to bump up
completion rates than mature institu-
tions like the University.
Aside from discussing MOOCs, Bowen
said his conversation with the regents
included a variety of topics on the fron-
tier of digital education, including meth-
ods for harnessing technology in the
University's classrooms. Bowen and
the board talked at length about taking
advantage of the large amounts of data
that will be assembled from university
courses with online components.
Bowen added that the board and
administrators asked good questions,
especially in regards to pressing chal-
lenges such as intellectual property or
preventing the privatization of data col-
lected.
"There are people at Michigan who
are working very creatively on how to
use this data appropriately," Bowen said.
In the fall, Pollack initiated a series
of town halls to seek input on the Uni-
versity's approach to digital and engaged
education.
Regent Andrea Fischer Newman (R),
chair of the Board of Regents, said the
University is most concerned with inte-
grating technology into learning. New-
man added that she agreed with Bowen's
assessment that MOOCs might not be as
much of a priority for the University.
"I think we will look at all opportuni-
ties, but initially we are most concerned
with the best use of technology for our
current students on campus," Newman
said.
Last year in California, the regents
met with Dan Russell, a Google research
scientist leading Google's MOOC port-
folio. He recommended the University
begin with a small investment in MOOCs
and see where it goes, before deciding
whether or not to adopt the platform in
full force.
"Historically, once upon a time, uni-
versities were threatened by the intro-
duction of low-cost printed books,"
Russell said in a January 2013 interview.
"They survived that. That seems incon-
ceivable now. When we look back at this
time 20 years from now, universities,
I predict, will still be around and we'll
have the same sort of 'you're kidding'
response. 'How could they think this
could destroy the University?"'
If the regents expressed uncertainty
about MOOCs in their meetings with

Russell last winter, questions regarding
the future of MOOCs have not yet been
fully answered.
"What stood out to me the most is we
really don't know where it's headed,"
Newman said. "There's a lot of experi-
mentation going on. The University is
heavily engaged in that. I don't think
anyone has the answers at this time.
Obviously everyone is looking for the
magic bullet, but it's just not there."
In what Newman described as "the
best session we had," the board also met
with Miller and Johns Thursday.
Though the board did not meet with
any hospital officials last year in Cali-
fornia, Coleman said the conversa-
tion became especially pertinent as the
implementation of the Patient Protec-
tion and Affordable Care Act takes place
this year.
"Everybody is curious how the ACA
is going to impact academic health sys-
tems," Newman said.
Miller said the influx of patients
would be more gradual than many peo-
ple think, as sign-ups trickle in more
slowly than expected.
"People thinking there was a tsunami
of patients who were going to come into
the system - that's not goingto happen,"
Miller said.
Miller said academic health systems
must try to control costs and potential-
ly move away from the fee-per-service
model, which emphasizes quantity rath-
er than quality of service.
He added that the board was most
interested in exploring the differences
accounted for by geographic region
between the University of Michigan
Health System, Johns Hopkins and
Emory based on regional differences.
The board used the session to consider
the reputation of UMHS, particularly in
relation to the merits or downsides of
acquiring or aligning with other hospital
groups.
"We are interested in alliances with
other hospitals and practice groups and
these are all things both Hopkins and
Emory are also doing," Newman said.
In December, UMHS announced an
agreement with Allegiance Health, a
health system based in Jackson, Mich.
While UMHS will initially serve as the
system's parent company, it will eventu-
ally absorb the system.
Miller said though he has seen a trend

of consolidating community hospitals
into larger health systems, an academ-
ic health system should only pursue
acquisitions or agreements when the
institution is financially stable and an
agreement could bring benefits to both
institutions.
"You strengthen the core," Miller
said. "You strengthen the main hospi-
tal, recruit great leaders. That's how you
improve your overall reputation."
In a separate meeting, the board also
met with Salovey for a session themed
"Excellence in Higher Education."
Through Yale's Office of Public
Affairs, Salovey declined an interview
for this article.
In an interview before the trip, Cole-
man said Salovey's talk would focus
on a range of broader issues, including
affordability and educational quality.
Though diversity on campus was a
part of Salovey's talk, it did not sur-
face on the agenda of other sessions.
According to University spokesman
Rick Fitzgerald, Salovey's conversation
focused on broader themes of diversity
in higher education, rather than specifi-
cally related to the University.
While Newman said she was not pres-
ent for the last portion of Salovey's talk,
she did not think the #BBUM campaign
was discussed during the trip.
In an e-mail sent to students and fac-
ulty during the trip, Pollack announced
a list of initiatives designed to combat
the concerns raised by the #BBUM cam-
paign.
Rather than pinpointing initiatives
or methods the University should be
copying, Newman said the trip's ses-
sions were designed to allow the board
to learn what's going on at institutions
outside of the University.
She also said these types of conver-
sations are especially important as the
board searches for the next university
president.
"I think as you are searching for a new
president, it always informs your think-
ing and knowledge base as you're talking
to people," Newman said. "This was a
learning session. This was an opportu-
nity to explore and learn. It's kind of like
going back to school. You never want to
be too insular."


LEGISLATION
From Page 1A
healthcare, others choose not to due to
misgivings about HealthCare.gov. When
the site first went live in October, glitches
in the system lead to difficulty in login and
long wait-times afterward.
Rackham student Juliana Stebbins,
who is involved in ACA outreach, said
although the site is now running smooth-
ly, the initial rollout scared people away.
"At first people were not proactive
about going out and getting insurance
because it was intimidating or they just
didn't really understand it," Stebbins said.
"Now it's because it's broken and it's con-
fusing. You're hearing all this negative
publicity about it, and it just deters the
process even longer."
Students have also been trying to edu-
cate the community about Michigan's
new Medicaid expansion - known as the
Healthy Michigan plan.
Michigan is one of 25 states to expand

Medicaid. Unlike other states, Michigan
has delayed the process until April of this
year. At that time, Medicaid will become
available for most people age 19 to 64 who
make less than $15,000 a year. Stebbins
said a big challenge on Healthy Michigan
education was getting past the stigma that
Medicaid is only for the sick.
"When people think of Medicaid they
don't really associate themselves with it
because it used to be really limited to a
certain demographic and a certain popu-
lation - disabled, blinds, children," Steb-
bins said. "Being a working adult, people
just don't assume that they fall into that
category, but now they do."
Stebbins added that Medicaid would be
the ideal plan for students older than age
26, who legally can no longer be insured
under their parents' plan. It will be cheap-
er than University plans, and studentloans
are not counted against you when calculating
aninsurancepremium, Stebbinsadded.
A Jan. 13 New York Times article
reported only 24 percent of people ages
18 to 34 are choosing an ACA healthcare

plan. Since insurance plans rely on healthy
individuals to contribute to keep premi-
ums down, costs are likely to increase
if younger demographics don't enroll in
greater numbers. Rheingans attributed
the low percentage of young enrollees to
the tendency of young people to wait until
the last minute.
"Young people are notorious for doing
things at the last minute," Rheingans
said. "Now that people are hearing that
the website is working, people are saying
'Okay I'll go on, but I don't have to go on
until March 31.'So you know young people
aren't going to go on until the end of Feb-
ruary or March."
Even so, some young people may not
want health insurance through the ACA,
or at all for that matter. A December Gal-
lup Poll reported that said a majority of
people aged 18 to 29 disapprove of the
ACA, and fewer than a third of the unin-
sured members of this age group would
sign up for insurance through the act.
The Public Interest Research Group in
Michigan has created a health insurance

guidebook for young people, and is work-
ing with the University, Eastern Michigan
University and Washtenaw Community
College to get information out to students.
Stebbins said before open enrollment
ends, her organization plans to set up
tables around campus where students can
come and talk about insurance. Whatever
method is used, Stebbins said "the young
invincibles" - people who think they
don't need insurance - are an issue that
needs to be addressed.
This year, individuals will pay $95
per adult or 1 percent of taxable income,
whichever is greater, for remaining unin-
sured, according to the Michigan Depart-
ment of Insurance and Financial Services.
These fines increase to $325 or 2 percent
of income in 2015 and $695 or 2.5 percent
of income in 2016.
"I think that when people get stuck
with a fine, the tax penalty, that may
change their attitude," Stebbins said. "I
don't know what it's going to take to get young
people enrolled in health insurance, but it's a
really bigproblemifthey don't."

RESOLUTIONS

body's hurting alot because of that."
one of these resolutions, co-spon-
sored by the University and Indiana
University delegations, supports
federal efforts to promote tuition
equality at Big Ten schools for undoc-
umented youth.
The University's Board of Regents
passed measures to implement tuition
equality in July. The board revised
residency guidelines at the University,
making undocumented resident stu-
dents eligible for in-state tuition costs.
Music senior Ellie Kirn, CSG com-
munications director, felt that the
convention's most important discus-
sion had to do with the Affordable
College Textbook Act, which ABTS
supported. The correlating resolution
endorses the "open textbook publishing
model," under which digital copies of
textbooks are published for free online.
She added that the student govern-
ment representatives will bear these
issues in mind later in the year when
the ABTS delegates head to Washing-
ton, D.C. as part of "Big Ten on the
Hill," where they will get the chance
to discuss policy with federal officials.
Kirnsaidthethree-dayeventwas also an
outlettocomparebureaucraticprocesses.
"Michigan is the only school with-
out a student sitting on the Board of
Regents," Proppe said. "It'll never
happen - it's in the Michigan state
constitution - but (the other schools)
were offering ideas to increase the
power of student government and
make the student voice more promi-
nent at Michigan."

CANCER
From Page 1A
fraction of cells act as seeds
of the tumor, Wicha said.
Cells in this state, known
as epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, are dormant but
can spread to other organs
in the body.
The process of these cells
spreading is called metas-
tasis, and studying this
process has been a key com-
ponent of the research find-
ings. The previous dearth of
research on the dormant
cells within the process
of metastasis has posed a
challenge to researchers
trying to find new treat-
ment options.
"As a matter of fact, in
breast cancer, we sometimes
have women that go out ten
or 15 years and we think are
cured, and then the cancer, it
turns out, was hiding in the
bone," Wicha said.
Moreover, the new find-
ings show that these exact
same cells have the capac-
ity to switch states, causing
them to not only look differ-
ent under the microscope,
but also turn on different
genes in the cell.
When the cells enter the
mesenchymal-epithelial
transition state, they can
no longer invade tissues
but they can grow and

reproduce into malignant
tumors.
The tumor microenviron-
ment enables these cells to
flip back and forth between
the EMT and MET-states,
researchers said. While the
cells' plasticity seems to be
the reason that they are able
to flip between two states,
the reason for the cells' abil-
ity to switch states at any
given time is unclear.
"We're very interested in
studying whether things like
stress that may change some
of the proteins or hormones
in your body may actually
cause the cells to change
their state and come out of
dormancy," Wicha said.
While this research tar-
gets breast cancer stem cells,
other research laboratories
around the world have con-
firmed that similar stem
cells are present in other
forms of cancer.
The center is currently
in the midst of early-stage
clinical trials on drugs that
target EMT-state stem cells.
Wicha was confident these
drugs will eventually target
dormant EMT-state cells in
patients.
"What's been very grati-
fying is to be able see the
research we're doing in
the laboratory now direct-
ly move into the clinic
and hopefully benefit
patients with cancer,"
Wicha said.

rediscover some of the old ones like
Gratzi," Magnini said.
Lucia Lagoy, assistant manager
at Cafe Zola, said the nature of Res-
taurant Week welcomes new cus-
tomers, especially wallet-conscious
students.
"It's a great opportunity for peo-
ple to come to our restaurant who
are interested in it but have other
favorite spots and might not try it
because they weren't sure about the
cuisine or you know they just want-
ed to get a sampling of our food
without committingtoafulldining
experience," Lagoy said.
Restaurant Week provides a
way for restaurateurs to experi-
ment with their menu offerings.
Cafe Zola featured a new menu and
assessed their customers' reactions,
Lagoy said.
"It was good for us to have sort
of a trial run in that sense, workthings
out, see what people liked, to see what
was really popular,"Lagoysaid.
Although Restaurant Week is
centered on noshing, Wanke said
it's also a way to bring the commu-
nity together and entice visitors to
come downtown during the frigid
winter months.
"It's a great exposure where the
public gets to come in and see us
and maybe didn't even know we
existed," Wanke said. "It's a good
community thing for restaurants
throughoutthe areato join together
and showcase what we all offer at a
reasonably priced point."

Yale blues(book)
Universities should create student friendly course databases
ast week, Yale University students trying to access "Yale Bluebook
+" received a message the website had been blocked and deemed
"malicious" by administrators. Many users claimed that the site -
created to aid students in course planning -was a better resource than similar
sites constructed by the university. According to the Yale IT department,
YBB+ was forced to shut down due to the design of the site which encouraged
a rating system and already existing digital resources to help students design
their schedules. Furthermore, Yale College Dean Mary Miller stated, "Yale's
policy on free expression and free speech entitles no one to appropriate a
Yale resource and use it as their own." Instead of shutting down a website
that only enhances the academic experience, Yale should work to develop
sites that better resemble the user-friendly system students preferred. Using
YBB+ as an example, the University of Michigan should be working with
students to create a website that provides more comprehensive information
on courses and instructor evaluations.

Escaping social stigma

hough not yet legally equal
to heterosexuals, recent
LGBTQ community action
is moving gays
closer to politi-
cal equality.
Seventeen states
allow gay mar-
riage, seven
of which
passed legisla-
tion in 2013. The MICHAEL
Supreme Court SCHRAM1VM
also overturned
the Defense of
Marriage Act, allowing married
couples social security benefits,
shared health insurance and retire-
ment savings. These changes dem-
onstrate genuine strides towards
civic equality.
But they mean absolutely nothing
without social equality.
By social equality, I mean the gen-
eral population treating LGBTQ com-
munity members equally. Whether
someone knows, assumes or believes
that anotheris gay shouldn't differen-
tiate a conversation from one they'd
have with a heterosexual. (The one
exception being a romantic-based
conversation, which falls under the
domain of differences between het-
erosexual and LGBT individuals.)
Though this shouldn't be the case,
I'm treated differently in situations
where people don't assume I'mgay.
Let's use the gym as an example.
I enter the Central Campus Rec-
reational Building and see the guy
swiping people in. I give him my
MCard and he swipes it as he says,
"Sup, dude." We're on a "dude" basis
as he sees me pretty frequently.
I head down a flight of stairs to
the weight room. Upon entering, I
see one of the regulars. We make
eye contact, and I give him a head
nod to acknowledge his presence.
He does the same. Having a shared
existence in the gym has given us
a mutual respect for each other. I
head to the bench press and begin
exercising when a guy signals that
he wants my attention.
"Hey man, can you spot me?"

"For sure, dude," I respond.
I help him with his set, and on
his ninth rep, I give him a little help
pushing the bar up. After finishing,
he responds with a "Thanks man,"
and I respond with a "No problem."
At the gym, these guys talk to me
the same way that they'd talk to the
rest of their buddies. They treat me
with the same respect, and they don't
go into a conversation assuming that
I'm any different than they are.
However, in many other situa-
tions, I'm not treated as guys would
treat each other. For instance, I was
talking to a guy on the first day of a
class. We were having a good conver-
sation, and I thought that we couldbe
pretty good friends. Then, we got on
the topic of music. He asked who my
favorite musician was and, in giving
an honest answer, I responded with
Lady Gaga.
Liking Lady Gaga shouldn't be
used to assume a guy is gay. Music
preferences - like clothing choices,
hairstyle and personality traits -
aren't indicators of homosexuality;
an attraction to the same sex is.
However, I can't deny that our soci-
ety contains (incorrect) gay stereo-
types, and liking Lady Gaga is one
of them.
So when I gave that response -
even though it wasn't a fair assump-
tion - I could tell that he thought I
was gay. And it shifted our interac-
tions. Of course he was never out-
right mean to me, but he treated
me differently than when he didn't
believe I was gay. This shouldn't
happen. Sure, some of my traits are
more feminine than a stereotypi-
cal guy, and I am gay. But when it
comes down to it, I'm still a guy.
Being gay means having a dif-
ferent sexual orientation. It doesn't
dictate my interests. I like Lady
Gaga because I like Lady Gaga. I
wear orange jackets because I like
wearing orange jackets. I enjoy real-
ity television because I enjoy real-
ity television. They may differ from
male stereotypes, but I don't enjoy
them because I'm gay. My interests
also shouldn't make others feel that

I'm any more different than any of
their friends. One friend may love
rap and the other loves rock, but this
doesn't influence their friendship.
Therefore, although my enjoyment
of pop deviates more strikingly from
the norm, it shouldn't cause any dif-
ferences compared to guys who like
rap or rock. And havingsome stereo-
typically feminine interests doesn't
indicate that all my interests are ste-
reotypically gay. I like lifting weights
and video games just as much as the
next guy, and Kendrick Lamar is one
of my favorite artists. Like everyone
else, I'm a unique individual with a
variety of interests.
Not only does sexuality bear no
influence on my hobbies, it bears
no influence on my personality. I
have some stereotypically gay traits.
I use "like" frequently and I can
quote "Mean Girls" in its entirety
- although many straight guys do
both of these surprisingly frequently.
However, these choices don't define
who I am as a person. They're just
traits and quotes that I enjoy. Having
these doesn't imply that all my man-
nerisms are feminine.
Boys aren't solely responsible for
homosexual stereotyping. Though
in my experiences, I generally see
guys stereotyping a little more than
girls, girls can stereotype as well.
And to say that every guy treats me
prejudicially wouldn't be accurate.
I've met a lot of guys who get to
know me for who I am as a person,
not letting my sexuality influence
their perception of me. But I've
also met enough people - too many
actually - that instantaneously ste-
reotype me. Though I'm not a lesbi-
an, transgender or bisexual, I know
both men and women stereotype
each of these subgroups. I can't
know whether every LGBT member
would confirm this with certainty,
but at least for me, no U.S. legisla-
tion aimed at making me feel like a
political insider can offset feeling
like a social outsider.

Created by brothers Peter Xu and Harry
Yu, YBB+ was intended to ease the process of
course selection by offering average class and
professor evaluations all in one place. The
site was created to unify the scattered infor-
mation on Yale's internal system that's more
difficult for students to access and navigate.
Prior to the shutdown, more than 2,000 of
Yale's 5,000 undergraduates were using the
site to plan their class schedules. After the
database was effectively blocked, Xu and Yu
were threatened with disciplinary action for
the unauthorized use of the Yale logos. Ulti-
mately, the university deleted the site, forcing
thousands of students to revert back to less
efficient systems of course planning.
Yale's original site - which Yu and Xu
set out to improve - was itself a student-
created product, eventually bought out by
the university. However, facing difficulty
finding and comparing courses upon their
arrival at Yale, Xu and Yu decided to create
a new site - actions that match Yale's cur-
riculum to promote innovation and academic
freedom. Information this vital should be

readily available to students in a way that's
easily accessible. Given YBB+'s success,
the university should seek student input in
designing a new website, instead of stifling
student innovation.
TheUniversityofMichiganmustlearnfrom
the success of YBB+ and create a centralized
website for students to easily access informa-
tion about courses. Providing evaluations of
professors while scheduling classes would be
incredibly beneficial to the student body. The
University should utilize the resources avail-
able to create such a website and encourage
student input in its creation.
If Yale truly is the great place for innova-
tion it prides itself on being, then sites like
YBB+ - which are clearly in the best interest
of its students - shouldn't be forced to shut
down. Instead of impeding on student inno-
vation, Yale should work towards offering
students the most efficient resources. Fur-
thermore, the University of Michigan must
also work toward creating a centralized web-
site to give students as much information on
courses as they can when scheduling.

aying field as my offices for students with disabilities

tend to focus on more easily identi-

issues, designed to accommodate
those with "invisible illnesses" and

The University should take a
close look at this program, and
adapt similar core values and im-
tiatives. While students are able to
register their chronic illness with
the University, there is more to be
done. Students could benefit from
having a space to simply meet each

modification of the existing system.

accommodations, they should
expand to provide adequate health-
care accommodations as well.
Perhaps UHS should identify for
students particular physicians
who are most knowledgeable about
chronic illnesses, and funnel those
of us suffering from them through
a separate scheduling process. Too
often, due to UHS's lack of under-
standing, I have been forced to out-
source my care to other physicians

MLive article criminalizes
the battle for equality
TO THE DAILY:
After a day of many wonderful symposiums
and panels commemorating Martin Luther
King Jr. for his activism in leading the Civil
Rights Movement, I was very upset when I
came home and saw an MLive article titled
"Being Black at University of Michigan orga-
nizers threaten 'physical action' if demands
aren't met." The article's title gives the first
impression that those organizing the #BBUM
campaign are "the bad guys" intendingto harm
others, emphasizing "physical action" in a way
where people who are unfamiliar with activist
terms would misinterpret it to mean "violence."
This is not the case. "Physical action" most
commonly means marches, singing, chanting,
human blockades, etc. The article's emphasis
on "threatening 'physical action'" is playing
into the stereotype that Blacks are aggressive
and irrational. Of all days, MLive chose MLK
Day to criminalize a minority group assertively
standing up for its rights.
I have overheard people calling the pro-
test organizers "extortionists" and comparing
them to terrorists for their assertive efforts in
fighting for social justice. People are asking

why they won't "ask nicely," and the answer
is simple - asking nicely has never worked for
the Black community. The Black community
has been oppressed for decades and is still very
much oppressed to this day.
Take a look at Detroit: it is dominantly
Black for a reason. Corrupt, racist planning
and policy has physically trapped thousands
of people in a cycle of poverty. Restrictive
covenants, anyone? Redlining? What about
the Fair Housing Act never being enforced,
thanks to former President Richard Nixon?
Job discrimination? Asking nicely is exactly
what people of power and privilege want!
They want the Black community to be quiet
and ask nicely so that they can continue to
ignore them. They want to keep them in a
political cage. Everyone needs to face the
facts - racism is still very alive today. Crimi-
nalizing this group of Black activists shows
that everyone, especially the University
of Michigan, has a lot of work to do in the
social justice department. I congratulate the
#BBUM campaign for standing up for human
rights, and I hope to see many more people -
Black, white, green or blue - join this ongo-
ing battle of fighting for true equality.

Alleged attack
on U.S. embassy
foiled by Israel

Intelligence
agency said suicide
bombing plans
linked to al-Qaida
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
on Wednesday said it had foiled
an "advanced" al-Qaida plan
to carry out a suicide bombing
on the U.S. Embassy in Tel
Aviv and bomb other targets, in
what analysts said was the first
time the global terror network's
leadership has been directly
involved in plotting an attack
inside Israel.
The Shin Bet intelligence
agency said it had arrested three
Palestinians who allegedly
plotted bombings, shootings,
kidnappings and other attacks.
It said the Palestinian men, two
from Jerusalem and one from the
West Bank, were recruited by an
operativebased in the Gaza Strip
who worked for al-Qaida leader
Ayman al-Zawahri.
The State Department said
the U.S. was not yet able to
corroborate the Israeli claims.
While a number of groups
inspired by al-Qaida have
carried out attacks against Israel
before, this appeared to mark the
first time an attack was directly
planned by al-Qaida leaders.
The Shin Bet said the Pales-
tinians planned on attacking a
Jerusalem conference center
with firearms and then kill res-
cue workers with a truck bomb.
Al-Qaida also planned to send
foreign militants to attack the
U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv on the
same day using explosives sup-
plied by the Palestinians, it said.
It said five men whose identity
and nationality were not
disclosed were to fly into Israel
with fake Russian passports to

attack the American embassy.
It was not clear where the men
are located.
The Palestinian operatives
had planned on several other
attacks, it said. One included
shooting out the tires of abus and
then gunning down passengers
and ambulance workers.
The agency said it the plot was
in "advanced planning stages"
but gave no further information
on how close the men got to car-
rying it out. It said the Palestin-
ians from Jerusalem had used
their Israeli resident cards to
scope out and gather intelligence
on targets. They were arrested in
the past few weeks, it said.
A number of al-Qaida-
inspired groups have carried out
rocket attacks from Gaza and
Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, as well
as shootings in the West Bank.
Israeli intelligence calls these
groups part of a "global jihad"
movement.
Aviv Oreg, a former head of
the Israeli military intelligence
unit that tracks al-Qaida, said
the plot marked the first time it
has been directly linked to an
attempted attack in Israel.
"This is the first time
that Ayman al-Zawahri was
directly involved," he said.
"For them, it would have been
a great achievement."
The Shin Bet said the three
suspects made contact with al-
Qaida over the Internet. It said
they planned on traveling to
Syria - where various jihadist
groups are battling the forces
of President Bashar Assad -
for training.
Oreg said that many for-
eign fighters fighting the Assad
regime are from Chechnya and
predominantly Muslim parts of
Russia and speculated that the
militants with the phony docu-
ments would be from there.

ANJA NIEDRINGHAUS/AP
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry points his finger at a press conference during the Syrian peace talks in Montreux, Switzerland, Wednesday.
Kerry: Assad's reign must end

Western delegation
insists on transfer
of power, Syrian
delegation refuses
MONTREUX, Switzerland
(AP) - Furiously divided from
the start, representatives of Syr-
ian President Bashar Assad and
the rebellion against him threat-
ened Wednesday to collapse a
peace conference intended to
lead them out of civil war.
Assad's future in the coun-
try devastated by three years of
bloodshed was at the heart of
the sparring, which took place
against a pristine Alpine back-
drop as Syrian forces and rebel
fighters clashed across a wide
area from Aleppo and Idlib in the

north to Daraa in the south.
U.S. and U.N. officials said
merely getting the two sides in
the same room was something
of a victory, but U.N. chief
Ban Ki-moon's claim that the
discussions were "harmonious
and constructive" was at odds
with the testy exchange when
he tried to get the podium
from Syrian Foreign Minister
Walid Moallem.
"You live in New York. I live
in Syria," Moallem angrily told
Ban. "I have the right to give
the Syrian version here in this
forum. After three years of
suffering, this is my right."
With little common ground,
the two sides were to meet
separately Thursday with
a U.N. negotiator, Lakhdar
Brahimi, who said he still did
not know if they were ready to

sit at the same table when talks
begin in earnest Friday. But,
Brahimi said, both sides had
shown some willingness to
bend on local cease-fires and
delivery of humanitarian aid,
and Russian Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov said they were
also working on possible terms
for a prisoner exchange.
The Western-backed opposi-
tion said Assad's departure was
their starting point, echoing the
position laid out by U.S. Secre-
tary of State John Kerry.
"The resolution cannot
be about one man's - or one
family's - insistence on clinging
to power," Kerry said.
The response from the
government delegation was firm
and blunt.
"There will be no transfer of
power, and President Bashar

Assad is staying," Syrian
Information Minister Omran
al-Zoubi told reporters.
The two sides seemed
impossibly far apart in opening
statements in the Swiss city
of Montreux, famed for its
stunning mountain views
and mellow jazz festival. The
waterfront road was barricaded
by roadblocks and hundreds
of security forces, with boats
patrolling the shores of Lake
Geneva day and night.
The small-town venue
was chosen in haste when a
watchmakers' convention left
Geneva hotels booked. That
made for some potentially
awkward encounters - some
of the opposition were staying
in the same hotel as the Syrian
government delegates, as were
the Americans.

Obama discusses epidemic of
sexual assault on campuses

After civilian deaths, Ukraine
opposition issues ultimatum

Protesters call for
early elections due
to rights violations
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -
Ukrainian opposition leaders
issued a stark ultimatum to
President Viktor Yanukovych
on Wednesday to call early
elections within 24 hours or
face more popular rage, after
at least two protesters were
killed in confrontations with
police in a grim escalation
of a two-monthlong political
crisis.
The protesters' deaths,
the first since the largely
peaceful protests started in
November, fueled fears that
the daily demonstrations
aimed at bringing down the
government over its decision
to shun the European Union
for closer ties to Moscow and
over human rights violations
could turn more violent.
With a central Kiev street
ablaze and covered with
thick black smoke from burn-
ing tires and several thou-
sand protesters continuing to

clash with riot police, oppo-
sition leaders urged tens of
thousands of demonstrators
in a nearby square to refrain
from violence and remain in
the main protest camp for the
next 24 hours.
They demanded that
Yanukovych dismiss the
government, call early
elections and scrap harsh anti-
protest legislation. It was last
week's passage of the laws
cracking down on protests that
set off the violent clashes.
"You, Mr. President, have
the opportunity to resolve
this issue. Early elections
will change the situation
without bloodshed and we
will do everything to achieve
that," opposition leader Vitali
Klitschko told some 40,000
people who braved freezing
temperatures on Kiev's
Independence Square late
Wednesday.
If Yanukovych does not
concede, "tomorrow we will
go forward together. And if
it's a bullet in the forehead,
then it's a bullet in the fore-
head, but in an honest, fair
and brave way," declared

another opposition leader,
Arseniy Yatsenyuk.
Yanukovych has showed little
willingness to compromise,
however. A three-hour meeting
with opposition leaders
accomplished "nothing,"
said Oleh Tyahbnybok, who
attended the session.
Meanwhile, the government
handed security forces extra
powers, including closing off
streets and firingwatercannon
against protesters despite
the freezing temperatures.
Police have already used
water cannon but insisted it
was only to put out fires. The
government also deployed an
armored personnel carrier at
the site of the clashes.
During Wednesday's
confrontations, riot police
violently beat and shot at
protesters, volunteer medics
and journalists. The Interior
Ministry announced that 70
protesters had been arrested.
Prime Minister Mykola
Azarov said the police did
not have live ammunition
and that opposition leaders
should be held responsible for
the deaths.

White House report
says drinking, drug
use fuel increased
college attacks
WASHINGTON (AP) -
President Barack Obama shone
a light Wednesday on a college
sexual assault epidemic that is
often shrouded in secrecy, with
victims fearing stigma, police
poorly trained to investigate
and universities reluctant to
disclose the violence.
A White House report
highlights a stunning
prevalence of rape on college
campuses, with 1 in 5 female
students assaulted while only 1
in 8 student victims report it.
"No one ismore atriskofbeing
raped or sexually assaulted
than women at our nation's
colleges and universities," said
the report by the White House
Council on Women and Girls.
Nearly 22 million American
women and 1.6 million men have
been raped in their lifetimes,
according to the report. It
chronicled the devastating
effects, including depression,
substance abuse and a wide
range of physical ailments such
as chronic pain and diabetes.
The report said campus
sexual assaults are fueled by
drinking and drug use that can
incapacitate victims, often at
student parties at the hands of
someone they know.
Perpetrators often are serial
offenders. One study cited by
the report found that 7 percent
of college men admitted to
attempting rape, and 62 percent
of those men admitted to
multiple offenses, averaging six
rapes each.
Obama, who has overseen
a military that has grappled
with its own crisis of sexual
assaults, spoke out against the
crime as "an affront on our
basic decency and humanity."
He then signed a memorandum
creating a task force to respond

to campus rapes.
Obama said he was speaking
out as president and a father of
two daughters, and that men
must express outrage to stop
the crime.
"We need to encourage
young people, men and women,
to realize that sexual assault is
simply unacceptable," Obama
said. "And they're going to
have to summon the bravery to
stand up and say so, especially
when the social pressure to
keep quiet or to go along can be
very intense."
Obama gave the task force,
comprised of administration
officials, 90 days to come up
with recommendations for col-
leges to prevent and respond
to the crime, increase public
awareness of each school's track
record and enhance coordina-
tion among federal agencies to
hold schools accountable if they
don't confront the problem.
Records obtained by The
Associated Press under the
federal Freedom of Informa-
tion Act illustrate a continuing
problem for colleges in inves-
tigating crime. The documents
include anonymous complaints
sent to the Education Depart-
ment, often alleging universities
haven't accurately reported on-
campus crime or appropriately
punished assailants as required
under federal law.
A former Amherst College
student, Angie Epifano,
has accused the school of
trivializing her report of being
raped in a dorm room in 2011 by
an acquaintance. She said school
counselors questioned whether
she was really raped, refused
her request to change dorms,
discouraged her from pressing
charges and had police take
her to a psychiatric ward. She
withdrew from Amherst while
her alleged attacker graduated.
Among the federal laws
requiring colleges to address
sexual assault are: Title IX,
which prohibits gender dis-
crimination in education; the
renewed Violence Against

Women Act, which was signed
into law last year with new
provisions on college sexual
assault; and the Clery Act,
which requires colleges and
universities to publicly report
their crime statistics every year.
The Education Department
has investigated and fined
several schools for not
accurately reporting crimes.
Most notably was a 2006 case
at Eastern Michigan University,
in which the government
eventually fined the school a
then-record $357,000 for not
revealing a student had been
sexual assaulted and murdered
in her dorm room.
Violent crime can be under-
reported on college campuses,
advocates say, because of a uni-
versity's public-image incentive
to keep figures low, or because
crimes can occur off campus
and instead investigatedby local
police. Other times, schools put
such suspects before a campus
court whose proceedings are
largely secret and not subjected
to judicial review.
Students Active for Ending
Rape, a nonprofit group that
works with student activists to
push for sexual assault policy
changes on their campuses, said
in a report last year that schools
often do not fully address the
problem. The report gave more
than 80 percent of college
policies a grade C or below, an
F to nearly one-quarter and said
one-third don't fully comply
with the Clery Act.
The White House report
also declares that the criminal
justice response to sexual
assault broadly is too often
inadequate and lays out a goal of
increasing arrest, prosecution
and conviction rates without
any specific targets.
The report blames police bias
and a lack of training to investi-
gate and prosecute sex crimes
for low arrest rates and says the
federal government should pro-
mote training and help police
increase testing of DNA evi-
dence collected from victims.

17-16 campaign last season, he
had charged full force into his
junior year with one goal: to be
an NCAA All-American. A long
shot, Huntley made tremendous
strides during the summer, which
he spent training in Ann Arbor.
The efforts didn't go unnoticedby
the coaches, who named Huntley
team captain despite being
just a junior and though other
teammates had superior records.
"We felt that the way he

Responding well to the leader-
ship role, Huntley had cruised to
a 4-1 start, looking like the All-
American he had long dreamt of
becoming. After winningthe first
round of the Cliff Keen Invita-
tional in Las Vegas 17-5, Huntley
was up four points on Northern
Iowa's Kyle Lux. With Lux on his
back and a pin well within reach,
Huntley clenched his grip, pre-
paring for the kill.
Then, it happened.
A desperation kick by Lux, a
shift of weight just large enough
to matter, stretched Huntley's
hold, tearinghis pectoral muscle.
Huntley's grip released. Though
not known at the time, it was
Huntley's last hold of the season.

"What we've been trying to
stress to him is that it isn't just
working hard, which he does, but
it's about doing the little things
and living the lifestyle."
Unfortunate as it is, this isn't
Huntley's first experience with
a season-ending injury. Minutes
into his collegiate debut, a fateful
turn tore his anterior cruciate
ligament, delaying his time as a
Michigan wrestler another year.
The ACL injury had a longer
recovery time, but there's no
doubt the pectoral tear hurts
more for Huntley, for he too was
ready to make the leap.
"I worked my ass off all last
year and all summer thinking
that this year would be the
year," Huntley said. "I was ready
to make a name for myself, to
be an All-American. Before, I
didn't have the confidence to
go as far, but this year I had it.
Everything was there. To just
have it all taken away so quickly
is beyond disappointing."
Despite the setback, Huntley is
determined to stay optimistic.
With what both McFarland and
Huntley deemed a "pretty good
shot" at obtaining a second
redshirt year, Huntley will
likely have two seasons left
as a Wolverine. With another
year comes another chance to
elevate his game.
"This could endupbeingone of
the best things to happen to me,"
Huntley said. "I've been doing a
lot of thinking about wrestling,
and I have two years left, maybe
one. And in no other time in my
life are people going to come from
all over and watch me compete.
"If I'm a businessman or a law-
yer, no one's going to come watch
me write papers all day. It sounds
corny, but it's my chance to be a
hero. I'm also starting to realize
how quickly you can lose it all too,
and I was taking that for granted
before. I'm twice as driven now
realizing the opportunity I have
to do somethingspecial."
The cheers can be heard
from outside the gym now. As
Michigan freshman sensation
Adam Coon slams a Purdue
wrestler to the mat, nearly
pinning him, the crowd at Cliff
Keen Arena rises to its feet.
Among those standing and
cheering in the stands is Massa.
That glory was once his, but
today Massa is confined to a seat
behind the Wolverine bench and
a uniform of a dark gray hoodie
and darker jeans.
Closer to the action is Huntley.
He's remained the team's captain,
and he cheers passionately in
khaki pants and blue polo, an out-
fit normally reserved for coaches.
As the Wolverines defeat Min-
nesota 19-14 to win their Big Ten
debut, the two sidelined leaders
of the team remain standing. It's a
tale of two different stories in one
long season. One stands in antici-
pation for greatness to come; the
other hopes that an unfair, year-
long setback proves to be a detour
to a long, legendary journey.

Deadly in the Medley: The 200-medley relay's impact

By CAROLYN KODIS
Daily Sports Writer
Of the 16 events in a women's
collegiate swim meet, 14 of them
are individual races. Swimming
isn't a team-oriented sport. It's
up to each swimmer to pull her
own weight.
But what about those other
two events, the relays? How do
four individuals come together
for a race and win?
On the surface, it seems like
there is a simple formula to create
a successful relay, but it goes
far beyond that. No swimmer is
ever competing at the same time
as another in a relay. Often, the
swimmer can never hear any
actual words of encouragement,
just some muffled noise.
But Michigan women's swim
and dive coach Mike Bottom has
figured out part of the formula.
This year he put senior Angie
Chokran, sophomores Ali DeLoof
and Zoe Mattingly and freshman
Julia Fiks Salem together to make
a powerhouse relay.
"We just take the fastest
of what we got," Bottom said.
"We're putting together a team
that came from pretty much
nowhere. And relays are the first
place where you can start to make
an impact."
This season, Michigan has
figured out the perfect mix of
swimmers. And this season the
200-medley relay is driving the
Wolverines' success.

Not only does it take four
different strokes to comprise
a relay, but also four different
personalities as unique as the
strokes themselves. Michigan
has done just that and created
a magical combination. The
200-medley relay was able to put
the team back into this individual
sport, and not just for the four
swimming it, but for everyone
cheering on the side of the pool.
"One of the things coach has
stressed to us a lot with this relay
in particular is afterwards, if we
win, he wants Julia and the rest
of us to just point at the team
because this relay is for the team,"
Mattingly said.
Fourthleg: Freestyle
Then there's Fiks Salem --
the anchor. Out of the pool the
Brazilian is quiet, but in the pool,
she's feisty and dangerous - the
final exclamation point to this
dynamic team. She sealsthe deal.
"Julia's the lone freshman,"
Mattingly said. "But honestly,
she doesn't really act like it. She
swims the freestyle ... so she has
a lot of pressure on her, but she
handles it so well."
Added Chokran: "She is one of
the fastest learners Ive ever met."
Unlike in the other three
strokes, Michigan isn't the stron-
gest when it comes to freestyle
sprinters. Yet Fiks Salem is able
to get her hand on the wall first in
the 200-medley relay.

Added Fiks Salem: "Ali's just
pure talent. Every time (she's) on
the block, you know she's going to
touch first."
With DeLoof leading off, the
team has placed in the top five in
all but one of Michigan's meets
so far this season. Of those eight
meets, the 200-medley relay team
has finished first in five of them.
The relay has a shot to compete
at the National Championship
with a'B' time, but the women are
working towards making them-
selves a lock with an 'A' time. Get-
ting an 'A' time means that they'll
automatically qualify for the
National Championship, while a
'B' time isn't a guaranteed invite.


way to start off the meet for our
team," Chokran said. "We're
representing our team. We're
not representing each of these
individuals. This is about
Michigan, and to be able to start it
off for everyone that's on the side
of the pool ... itgives me chills."
Third leg: Butterfly
Mattingly has a commanding
presence when she walks in a
room. She's loud, she's funny and*
her smile is contagious. Whether
she's talking or not, Mattingly is
hard to ignore.
"Zoe is very emotional,"
Bottom said. "When things are

First leg of race: Backstroke Second leg: Breaststroke

DeLoof appears quiet, calm,
cool and collected at first.
When she speaks, she speaks
with an extensive knowledge
of swimming.
So far this season, DeLoof
has broken five pool records and
been named Big Ten Swimmer
of the Week three times. Her
most important contribution,
though, is what she's doing in the
200-medley relay.
"Ali performs at such a high
level and doesn't ever let anything
get in her way as far as getting
nervous," Chokran said.

Chokran is the leader of this
relay team, but not necessar-
ily because of her age. The lone
senior takes charge both in and
outofthe pool. Notonlyisshe one
of Michigan's captains, but she
also makes sure every silence is
filled, whether it's cheering dur-
ing a meet or encouraging team-
mates during practice. Chokran's
been a part of the 200-medley
relay since her freshman year and
uses that experience to help out
her underclassmen counterparts.
"She's kind of like our guiding
force," Mattingly said. "She's

Clockwise from top left: Zoe Mattingly, Ali DeLoof and Angie Chokran

been around the block and done
all of these things alot more times
than we have. So she sets the tone
for being the leader."
Aside from the relay, Chokran
dominates in the individual
breaststroke events. At the
Winter National Championships,
she finished sixth in the 100-yard
breaststroke and eighth in the
200-yard breaststroke. But these
accolades don't quite , compare

to what she accomplishes while
swimming the second leg of the
medley relay.
This race serves as a major cat-
alyst for Michigan. Not only do
its consistent first-place finishes
gain points for the team, but it's
also the first event in every meet,
setting the tone for the rest of the
meet. Which makes Chokran's
presence all the more important.
"I think this is an excellent

The No. Sst
14 Michigan Sports Detroit
hockey team
(2-2 Big Ten, I0-6-2 overall) will
play a two-game series against
Michigan State on Thursday
at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit,
and Friday in East Lansing. The
Wolverines are winless in their
last five games.
Looking to avenge a rather

embarrassing defeat, and with
aspirations to climb back atop the
Big Ten title race, there's much
more at stake than statewide
bragging rights.
The Spartans (2-2-2, 8-10-3)
come into the weekend riding
the high point of their season
- a 3-1-2 mark in the past six
games - including a 3-0 win over
Michigan on Dec. 28 in the Great
Lakes Invitational. Anchored
by sophomore goaltender Jake
Hildebrand, Michigan State's
defense has been its backbone
during the recent string of
success, ranking 12th nationally
in goals against by allowing an
average of 2.33 goals each game.
In the other crease, freshman
Zach Nagelvoort matches up
nicely with Hildebrand, actually
edging him out in save percent-
age and goals-against average.
The problem for the young net-
minder is that he isn't getting
any help.
Nearly two weeks ago,
Michigan scored three goals in
two games at Wisconsin. That
didn't quite scream success,
especially when the Wolverines
conceded five on Friday and
three more Saturday.

"You're not going to win any
games doing that," Berenson said.
And they haven't. During the
program's current winless streak
- its longest since 2011, includ-
ing last season's losing record -
Michigan has scored just seven
goals. To put things in perspec-
tive, the Wolverines scored 19 in
the four games beforehand, and
they won all of them.
Sometimes, the chances have
been copious, but finishing them
has been more of a concern. At
Wisconsin, though, Michigan
failed to get pucks deep and
played in their own zone for what
seemed like minutes at a time.
Berenson's offense needs a
little kick, and he's tinkered
with lines in practice this week
in hopes to re-ignite some early
season fire.
Thursday, sophomore forward
Andrew Copp will likely be cen-
tering a line with junior forward
Phil Di Giuseppe and sophomore
forward Boo Nieves. Copp has
been on a tear with eight points
- six goals and two assists - in
his past seven games.
"This will give Boo maybe a
fresh start playing with someone
he's played a lot with," Berenson
said. "He played a lot with Phillip
most of last year. Copp, who is
playing with a lot of confidence
right now, I think he'll be a good
leader on that line."
Nieves has had a slow start to
his sophomore campaign, but his
speed and goal-scoring abilities
would certainly provide that
extra punch Berenson's been
looking for. In fact, it might be
most appropriate for Nieves
to break out of that shell this
weekend. Last season, he tallied
eight points in six games against
the Spartans.
He and the rest of the
underclassmen know about
the magnitude of this rivalry.
Copp used the well-known little
brother reference this week, but
paused for a momeint when asked
if Michigan was better than
Michigan State on paper.
"We're confident that we can
beat those guys every night," he
concluded.

The Michigan women's

and inexperienced, but it's
also one of the hottest teams
in the Big Ten.
The Wolverines fell out of
this week's AP rankings, to No.
29, but they hope to close the
gap with Ohio State (2-3, 12-9)

rivals met earlier this season

"Golly, the Buckeyes are a

'M' holds off late Iowa rally

With Walton's injury, Albrecht
fills in as viable option

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Sophomore guard Spike
Albrecht found himself in a
new position Wednesday: a
starter. Albrecht played well in
the Michigan men's basketball
team's win over No. 10 Iowa
and got the start because usual
starter, freshman guard Derrick
Walton had the flu.
It was Albrecht's first career
start for the Wolverines (6-0
Big Ten, 14-4 overall), and he
helped lead them to a 75-67 win.
The 5-foot-11 guard usually
comes off the bench and shares
minutes with Walton. Save for
Walton's three minutes and
a short stint midway through
the second half when Michigan
coach John Beilein had
sophomore guard Caris LeVert

take over, Albrecht logged the
bulk of the minutes at point.
"They told me at the walk
around today that I was start-
ing," Albrecht said. "I thought
(Walton) was going to play
more than that. He went in and
I could just tell he was grabbing
his stomach, and I kinda fig-
ured I was gonna be the guy the
rest of the way."
Albrecht made the most of
the opportunity, but said he
didn't treat the game any differ-
ently being in the starting five.
His biggest contribution
against the 10th-ranked
Hawkeyes (4-2, 15-4) was what
he did sharing theball. Albrecht
helped Michigan control the
pace of the game against a
Hawkeye team that came into
the game averaging 86.8 points
per game - the best in the Big

Ten - and limiting opponents
to 66.6 points.
Iowa coach Fran McCaffery
was impressed, and
complimented Albrecht's smart
play, calling him "a guy that
understands how to win."
Albrecht finished with seven
assists, highlighted by a pass
over the top of a confused Iowa
defense to sophomore forward
Glenn Robinson III who fin-
ished with an easy put in. The
basket stretched the Wolver-
ines' lead to five with just over
two minutes left in the game.
The Crown Point, Ind. native
shot 2-for-4 from the field and
knocked down two free throws
late in the game to help No. 21
Michigan ice the game. His
3-pointer late in the first half
put the Wolverines up three
and set them up for an 11-6 run

to close the half.
Albrecht also chipped in
with four of Michigan's nine
steals on defense, which led
to nine points in transition,
including freshman guard Zak
Irvin's corner 3-pointer late in
the game to stop an Iowa surge.
"Spike is a composed player,"
said fifth-year senior Jordan
Morgan. "He stepped up. He
played big - I mean seven
assists, no turn overs, that's
huge. He's a solid player. He's
a fighter, scrappy guy and we
knew he'd step in and have big
minutes for us."
Assuming Walton is healthy,
Albrecht will likely be back on
the bench at the beginning of
Saturday night's game against
Michigan State. But Albrecht is
certainly giving Beilein a rea-
son to find him more minutes.

Glass is Always
Shopping bongs and bowls in A2 7nJ (ByJulian Aidan and Akshay S

42 Degrees
Arguably the best known glass or head shop
on campus, 42 Degrees offers a huge selection
of, uh, accessories to anyone willing to visit its
E. Williams location, demarcated from its neigh-
bors in purple and green. Approaching its 15-year
anniversary, 42 has secured itself a position in
Ann Arbor stoner culture as a reliable source
of diverse quality goods. The cheekily-named
store's psychedelic staircase opens into a smok-
er's playground, the walls lined with pieces in
every shape and size - functional glass art, 42's
primary merchandise.
Cases exhibit high-quality accessories blown
primarily by local artists, with smoking acces-
sories in extravagant and bizarre shapes. Prid-
ing themselves on being able to offer a smoking
piece at every price, 42's selection is one of the
best in the city: casual or discreet individuals
have their choice of hundreds of cheap small
pieces, from spoon-shaped bowls to the smallest
of one-hitters. Those looking to make more of an
investment have plenty of options: bongs with
more diffusion than you know what to do with,
bubblers, fixed and handheld vapes and every
accessory that could possibly be needed. Behind

the counter, fifty different brightly colored roll-
ing papers sit alongside hemp wick, lighters, glass
screens, pokers and equally cheekily-named
cleaning and "smell removal" products. The
usual fare - incense, vaguely Buddhist trinkets
- round out the selection. While the more inter-
esting, bigger and less mass-produced pieces can
be thousands of dollars, it is difficult to imagine
someone feeling constrained among the panoply
of paraphernalia.
Despite a number of other options, most stu-
dents either haven't heard of or don't care to try
anywhere else: Many are won over by 42's selec-
tion, pricing and service. Knowledgeable, friend-
ly and accommodating, the crew is comfortable
managing interactions with all kinds of clientele
and matching them with their desired product.
Without fail, the equal part art gallery and candy
store charm wins over visitors and locals the first
time the top of the stairs is reached - often turn-

EVENT PREVIEW
Cultures to collide
in' U' performance

Farce-aceuticals:
A new rivalry
on campus

Collision to bring.
together a variety of
performance groups
By GILLIAN JAKAB
Daily Community & Culture Editor
Collision. From a mosh pit
to the particle accelerator at
CERN, collision is among the
most power-
ful creative Cultural
forces in the
world. Collision
The Uni-T
versity is .
home to stu- Mendelssohn
dents from Theatre
over 100
nations, and Tickets available
even more at the door for $7
distinct
cultures,
which has spawned an impres-
sive array of performing groups
representing their heritages.
But how can we check out this
cross-border breadth without it
becoming a full time job? There
needs to be a little unifying
force.
School of Education Junior
Julie Emra, with a group of
her friends, started the campus
organization Cultural Collision
this past fall to try to bring the
University's international art-
ists within striking distance of
one another.
"We always saw an absence
on this campus of representa-
tion of many cultures at one
performance," said Emra, who

is also a member of the Indian-
American Student Association.
There's Dance Mix, which
includes a variety of student
performance groups, but its
programming doesn't have a
focus on international or ethnic
diversity.
"I wanted something that
celebrated the cultures, and cel-
ebrated the ways people reach
back to their roots," Emra said.
"I think (music and dance) can
be the best ways to experience
another culture. We can talk
about it, and that's also really
important, but here you're see-
ing these things that are so
engrained, from so far back
- like the Malaysian Students
Association's Lion Dance."
Thursday's Cultural Col-
lision presents work from
K-Motion, Kol HaKavod, the
Malaysian Students Associa-
tion, the Native American Stu-
dent Association, rXn, The
Filipino American Student
Association, the Macedonian-
American Students Associa-
tion, Maize Mirchi, Revolution
and the Amala Dancers. Pro-
ceeds from the performance
will go to She's the First, a pro-
gram that supports education
for girls around the world.
Some students may be
unaware of these cultural
groups, or feel out of place
going to a performance if they
don't have a personal connec-
tion to it. Cultural Collision
wants to make them accessible
for easy sampling.
"It can be kind of like a

sneak peak of all the upcoming
shows," said Emra. "You'll have
a list of all the dates; we adver-
tise for the cultural organiza-
tions. A lot of people on this
campus, if they're not involved
in a cultural organization,
are not very unaware of how
involved other people are. It
also sometimes separates a lot
of cultures, and I really want to
encourage getting to know each
other. All of these perform-
ers are really passionate about
their roots and what they're
doing - their expression."
The show has no guidelines.
Performances can be anywhere
on the musical or movement
arts spectrum. Revolution, a
Chinese yo-yo group, balance
and toss their yo-yos to music in
rhythm, while executing their
own turns and jumps.
"I didn't want to force any-
thing on anyone," said Emra.
"It's a show to express yourself
culturally and if you're going to
express yourself through Kore-
an pop music instead of like
traditional Korean fan dance
or something then that's your
choice, it's just as representa-
tive of your culture."
But Cultural Collision's mis-
sion of slamming these groups
together will likely result in
more than just a lineup of dis-
tinct performances. You don't
have tobe an astrophysics major
to know that if you collide lots
of matter with enough energy,
in close enough proximity, you
can get sufficient creative force
to bang out a universe.

For those saddened by
the lack of football
excitement in the win-
ter, a new rivalry of global pro-
portions has arrived on campus
to channel

all of your
untapped
enthusiasm.

a footnote. I'm talking about
the opening of Walgreens ... just
a few hundred feet away from
CVS on State Street.
Walgreens is certainly the
underdog in this tale of two
pharmacies. As the company
ranked 37th largest in the world
(according to Fortune Maga-
zine's 2013 ranking), it will be
a long-shot if it wants to bring
the heat to top-dog CVS, ranked
13th largest in the world. These
rankings reflect, in part, the
substantial difference in prof-
its between the two companies:
CVS's $3.8 billion to Walgreens
$1.2 billion. One major contri-
bution to the increasing profit
disparity is a recent skirmish
over prescription contracts.
CVS came out ahead after Wal-
greens ended its relationship in
2011 with Express Script, a pre-
scription benefits manager that
offered discounted generics to
low-income families and indi-
viduals who otherwise couldn't
afford these vital drugs. The rift
resulted in higher costs for many
prescriptions at Walgreens com-
pared to CVS, and in some cases,
led drug companies to abandon
Walgreens altogether in favor of
other outlets.
But it's a new day, and a new
(financial) quarter. The game is
still young. University students
and Ann Arbor townies will have
to choose their loyalties. Admit-
tedly, Charles R. Walgreens,
Jr. did attend the University of

Michigan, and some may make
their decision on that fact alone.
Yet, for many the decision will
not be as obvious as that in the
Michigan/Ohio State rivalry.
I, personally, am not sure
which corporation I want to
win. Will I give my money to
CVS asa slap-in-the-face to Wal-
greens for abandoning Express
Script and preventing many
from accessing affordable medi-
cation? Or will I give my money
to Walgreens now that they have
renewed their contract after
much dissent? Maybe I'll give
my money to Walgreens for its
positive environmental record.
With solar panels powering
many of its stores, as well as the
use of energy-saving lighting,
removal of harmful air freshen-
ers, and selling of recycled prod-
ucts, Walgreens definitely scores
some major points. Of course,
I may also give my money to
CVS because of a lawsuit filed
in 2008 by the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission
against Walgreens on behalf of
10,000 Black Americans because
of the company's allegedly dis-
criminatory hiring practices.
However, I may also give my
money to Walgreens because
of the deceptive business prac-
tices CVS has used in the past -
encouraging physicians to push
more brand drugs - often at the
consumer's expense, but always
to the benefit of CVS's profit
margin. At the same time, CVS
does have a poor environmen-
tal record, supposedly combat-
ing pollution through waterway
cleanup efforts in Maine on the
one hand, while itself engaging
in improper disposal of its drugs
on the other. Nevertheless, I
never know which company my
consumer activist friends will
encourage me to not shop at, or
which company I'll be asked to
petition against on change.org.
Honestly, it may turn out that
I just go to Walgreens because
it's several hundred feet closer
to my home on the south side of
town. It also has a sexier atmo-
sphere, with cooler lighting
than CVS's suffocating palette.

It's also just the newest thing in
town. And it has Froyo appar-
ently? Decisions, decisions!
Maybe I'll just like littering
the sidewalk in front of Vil-
lage Apothecary and what was
once Village Corner with CVS
receipts more than I do Wal-
greens receipts. And yet maybe
I'll prefer Walgreens receipts
over CVS receipts when wrap-
ping my body in the cancerous
paper for a new "art project"
that pays homage to the prolif-
eration of these corporations in
Ann Arbor with the prolifera-
tion of my cells.
Walgreens has
Froyo? Things
just got real.
It's also plausible that I sim-
ply choose Walgreens because
I've become possessed by the
ghost of Charles R. Walgreen.
It's also plausible that I simply
choose Walgreens because I've
become possessed by the ghost
of Charles R. Walgreen, Jr.... or
both. Equally plausible is that I
choose Walgreens because I've
received a death threat from
the 10-person Walgreens fan
club on fanpop.com if I don't.
At the same time, I never know
when I'll have a prophetic
vision ... or find secret codes in
my alphabet soup ... "C" "V" "S"
... interesting ...
In the end, my loyalties may
go wherever the sale on Baby
Ruth bars happens to be on any
given day.
Nevertheless, I consider
myself a democratic kind of
guy. I'm all in favor of competi-
tion and free enterprise. Which
is why I say a Rite Aid ought to
open in the old Border's build-
ing on E. Liberty. Then we can
really decide.

It's make-it or
break-it time for
DJ Mustard

Jeff Nichols: a great
American filmmaker

The firsttimeteverheard
a DJ Mustard beat was,
like most hip-hop fans,
on Tyga's 2010 mixtape, Well Done
2. On my first listen of the tape, a
certain song titled "Rack City"
immediately caught my atten-
tion. It wasn't Tyga's hilariously
vulgar lines
or whisper-
like delivery
that got me.
Instead, it
was that
beat. You
know what
I'm talk-
ing about. JACKSON
Those HOWARD
vibrating,
sinister
synths,thesparsesnaps,the chants
over the chorus and that bass, oh
yeah. More than anything, it was
that bass. The first time I turned
the song on in my overpriced
studio-quality headphones I
ripped them off as soon as the bass
dropped because I thought my
eardrums were going to explode.
Honestly, I had never heard any-
thing like it. Clearly, America felt
the same way, as "Rack City" shot
to number seven on the Billboard
chart and earned Tyga a double-
platinum plaque. But what I kept
coming back to was that chant of
"Mustard on the beat, ho!" right
before the beat dropped. I needed
to know who this was. I needed to
hear more.
Fast-forward four years, and
DJ Mustard, whose real name is
(I swear) Dijon, is one of the big-
gest producers in hip-hop today.
He's had five more tracks place
in the Billboard Rap chart's top
20, and while he hasn't replicated
the success of "Rack City," DJ
Mustard has established himself
as a required contribution to any
major label rap release. Inaddition
to frequent collaborators Tyga,
YG and Ty Dolla Sign, Mustard
has worked with Drake (featured
on YG's "Who Do You Love"),
R. Kelly ("Spend That"), Young
Jeezy ("R.I.P.," "My Nigga"), 2
Chainz ("I'm Different"), T-Pain
("Up Down"), and even will.i.am
("Feelin' Myself"). And this past
November, Mustard revealed
that he had signed on Jay-Z's Roc
Nation label as an artist - not just
as a producer - and that he plans
to release a studio album soon.

Woah. Jay-Z doesn't just sign
anybody. This is a big deal. But, as
hip-hop history shows, DJ Mus-
tard isn't the first producer to
appear out of nowhere and change
the sound of contemporary rap.
The real question with Mustard
will be his staying power. Though
his beats are catchy and incredibly
fun to listen to, there isn't much
variation in the sound: you've
got a simple synth or piano line,
speaker-shattering bass and usu-
ally some combination of snaps,
chants and chimes. That's fine
and all, but DJ Mustard has just as
much of a chance of becoming the
next Lex Luger as he does the next
Timbaland. In fact, if we're going
to predict what might happen
to Mustard, Lex Luger is a great
place to start.
Luger, if you don't know, was
the 19-year-old wonder-kid who,
in 2010, with two records - Waka
Flocka Flame's "Hard in da Paint"
and Rick Ross's "B.M.F." - effec-
tively changed the entire sound
of rap music in a way that only Dr.
Dre, Kanye West and The Nep-
tunes had before. Luger got so
big that Kanye and Jay-Z, two of
the biggest rap artists of all time,
actually recruited him to produce
the first single off of their highly
anticipated collaboration album,
Watch the Throne. He went on and
produced for Tyga, Snoop Dogg,
Game, Meek Mill and Juicy J. And
then as suddenly as he had taken
over, Lex Luger became irrel-
evant. His beats were swallowed
up and spit back out by copycat
producers, and though he was still
given credit for his genre-chang-
ing trap music sound, he was no
longer needed on the boards.
In my opinion, there are two
main reasons why Luger flopped,
after such a hot start. First: terri-
ble management. Signed to Gucci
Mane's 1087 Brick Squad label,
Luger was managed by Waka
Flocka's mother, Debra Antney,
an unproven manager who was
partly responsible for Waka's
success, but also had significant
falling-outs with Gucci Mane and,
more notably, ayoung Nicki Minaj.
Instead of capitalizing on Luger's
success, it seems like Antney's
plan was just to flood the market
with Luger product. He was giv-
ing beats to anybody. I think if I
had released a mixtape in 2011, I
could've landed a Lex Luger beat.

Elite producers do not throw
beats around to just anyone, and
by doing so Luger made his craft
completely worthless.
Second, Luger didn't develop
or associate with any talent that
really represented his sound.
Every producer that has longev-
ity today has or has had a working
relationship with at least one art-
ist. Dr. Dre had Snoop Dogg and
Eminem, Kanye and Just Blaze
had Jay-Z, Pharrell and the Nep-
tunes had Clipse and Timbaland
had Missy Elliott. Through their
signature artists, these producers
were able to focus their sound and
truly define the music of a specific
area, whether it was Los Angeles,
New York, Detroit or Virginia.
Luger didn't have this. Yes, Rick
Ross and Waka were early sup-
porters, but Luger was unable to
maintain his presence because he
had no one to consistently spread
it. Here's where DJ Mustard is dif-
ferent.
Dijon is leading
a new West
Coast sound.
As "ratchet" and seemingly
brainless as his music tends to
be, DJ Mustard is managing his
career absolutely right. When his
buzz started to grow, he didn't
rush off and sign with the first
bidder. Instead, he bided his time
until the best possible deal came
along (hello, Jay-Z). More impor-
tantly, there is hope for Mustard's
longevity because, like the greats
that came before him, he is genu-
inely shaping the entire sound of
West Coast music right now. Up-
and-coming stars like YG and Ty
Dolla Sign have been produced
by Mustard from the start, and as
they've grown, he has too. Long
story short, Mustard is in con-
trol. Now it's up to him to prove
that he's more than the guy with
only the heavy bass and twerking
anthems, and if he plays it right,
you might just hear "Mustard
on the beat, ho!" in a thank-you
speech atnext year's Grammys.

By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
Acclaimed writer-director
Jeff Nichols grew up in suburban
Arkansas and I grew up a Michi-
gan kid, but we know the same
people. We know country people.
The kind of people who work
with their hands, who never
knew privilege, whose children
bear their values. They are a peo-
ple ofsuchenormous pridethatto
insult them threatens their entire
existence. They belong to a nos-
talgic America of small towns, of
broken buildings and fields laid in
row - that is beyond all possibil-
ity of returning to.
I talk about the experiences
I share with the people Nich-
ols creates in his characters,
however few or many, because
it possesses me to argue why he
is one of the most essential, and
poignant, American filmmak-
ers today. At 35 years old, he has
three films under his belt: "Shot-
gun Stories," "Take Shelter" and
his best known work yet, last
year's "Mud." All three films
carry themselves with a mini-
malist style - taciturn yet bold,
crafted with minimal artifice by
way of camera movement - and
each year Nichols's films pass
without recognition from audi-
ences and the Academy.
Nichols is currently filming
his first studio film, a sci-fi chase
film called "Midnight Special." I
think people should care. Here's
why:
Before penning a single
screenplay, Nichols, a son of the
South, was thinking of writing
a short story about mobsters in
New York. His father suggested
to him that he write about a place
to which he's privy and others are
ignorant - Arkansas.
The characters that populate
his films are not redneck carica-
tures. Nichols doesn't view them
as an outsider would - with sat-
ire and condescension. Each of
his scenes are visually textured
to such detail that a single frame
of the inside of a river-house or
family ranch gives you a good
idea of what lives these charac-
ters lead, and then he surprises
you. He develops them further.
He carries a special sensitivity
for these characters, their plights
and to their relationships with
one another.
Nichols's film casts, which
have included regular collabo-
rator Michael Shannon ("Man
of Steel") and Jessica Chastain
("Zero Dark Thirty"), simply slip
into the manners of their char-
acters - a testament not only to
their acting chops, but also to
howgood his scripts are. The dia-
lect and inflections of speech are
so natural that they speak to our
own childhood memories. When
a boy in "Mud" tells his best
friend, "Let's go hard-on," I had
a funny realization. I thought:
Damn, I haven't heard that in a
minute.
In "Shotgun Stories," two
brothers, fully grown, sitting
on a street curb reflect on their
town. One of them spits and says
if he owned the town, he'd tear

it down. The other is learning
to count cards for his son's sake.
He bears a vast shotgun scar on
his back that the film implies his
father gave him. He listens to his
brother, then dryly replies: "We
don't own shit." There's a raw-
ness to this movie, Nichols's first,
that you will see better refined
in his later work. But to see his
ideas in such bald and pure style
is an experience worth a viewing.
(Not to mention some masterful
scenes.)
There's an uncertainty in all
his protagonists, manifested by
their conflict with the past. In
"Take Shelter," Curtis LaForche
is having nightmares. He wakes
in sweat, wets the bed and later,
develops hallucinations in the
middle of the day, a plot devel-
opment made all the more reso-
nant and meaningful when it's
revealed to us that his mother
was schizophrenic and could not
raise him herself. He's scared
and most of all, ashamed. For
he may have failed, after all this
time of burying the past, mak-
ing the right decisions, to be the
man he could've been.
This is the root of all Nich-
ols's work: cold-sweated nights,
despair, a loss of will, stoicism,
and finally and against all reason,
triumph. Upon arriving home
late one night, Curtis and his
wife watch their daughter, who
is deaf, sleep. He says, "I still take
off my boots so I don't wake her
up." This is an early scene and
we understand his family is what
will sustain him through the ter-
rible things to come.
This is not the salient vision
of America that we've seen these
past few years. The depravity
and excess of "The Wolf of Wall
Street," though that film has its
own virtues, is nowhere to be
found. If the American Dream
is the ability to imagine a better
future, the dream of Nichols's
films is humble. It's grounded;
it's blue-collar. I think we will
always draw on the American
Pastoral, or at least our vision
of it, for a groundedness in the
American Dream - however
corny and over-generalized that
sounds.
Where a certain class of people
seems to have all the freedom
in the world, Nichols's families,
the people he knows, struggle.
They want only to prosper. They
derive no satisfaction in status
(or mountains of quaaludes).
They want to escape, but even if
offered the chance I doubt they
would make that decision rashly.
Too many memories, too much
pain to leave behind.
The nostalgic glow carries
through each scene in 2013's
"Mud," Nichols's coming-of-
age story. Widescreen is used to
wondrous effect. We zip evenly
over the waters of the Mississippi
and ahead - the Gulf. The world
splits open in vast fields of blue,
and you feel weightless.
In one scene a father takes out
his son on morning errands, and
the camera follows the boy's side-
long gaze at the townies. As we
watch, we reflect on how much
envy fills the boy - the exoticism

of a townie, the modernity of it -
and this camera shot grows even
more powerful when it's repeated
a second time at the film's end.
We then reflect on how much he
will miss those times with his
father. And it happens naturally.
He's a writer's director. In his
words: "I would consider myself
a better writer than I am a direc-
tor, simply because I get to try it
more."
Nichols understands coun-
try narratives with a passionate
human interest, but he also has
his artistic ambitions. "Mud" is
rife with literary echoes from
the likes of Harper Lee, Mark
Twain, William Faulkner and
more. Nichols concerns himself
with the ghosts of the past and
because he's an American - a
forward-looking people - the
future.
From "Midnight
Special" to
"Mud."
The hero's name is Mud (Mat-
thew McConaughey, "Dallas
Buyers Club"). Call Mud symbol-
ic. To me, he represents not only
the redemptive grace in the film's
story, but also in the future and
direction of Nichols's career.
Mud has a craggy smile, a
chipped front tooth like a rat, and
wears a white shirt like a uni-
form. He has antiquated supersti-
tions. Though daubed in dirt and
sweat like some changeling from
the swamp, he loses none of his
easy manner. Beneath the scrag-
gle, at once an outlaw and a saint,
is a desire for redemption. You
hear a lot of broken, not-going-
anywhere stories in small towns
that are dying. Mud restores a
sense of indomitability and opti-
mism - of faith in the future.
Now I return to "Take Shel-
ter," to Curtis. One night he's
driving his family home, he stops
on the highway shoulder and gets
out in the black of night to watch
a powerful lightning storm etch
across the sky, lightingthe clouds
then darkening, and the long,
jagged bolts stabbing outward as
though dueling. Curtis wonders
aloud, "Is anyone seeing this?"
He needs someone to believe in
him, because he may no longer
believe in himself. That's when
I recognized my father in this
character. His films are filled
with nostalgia and portentous
dread and despair. It's uncer-
tain where we go, and we need a
heroes like Mud.
As the months go by and we
near Nichols's next release,
"Midnight Special," I'd like to
think Nichols is too humble to
be sucked into delusion, that he
won'tbuy into his own hype, that
he'll always make decisionsabased
on his artistry. And come next
year - this summer - whenever
they finish shooting - I'd like to
think I won't be the only person
in the theater, thinking, "Is any-
one seeing this?"

of a priceless painting.
The last portion of the
trailer displays the indubitable
pantheon of star talent that

Beck's latest single "Blue
Moon," is an early release
from his next album Morn-
ing Phase due
out in Febru- C
ary. Beck is
notorious for BlUe Moon
experiment-
ing with var- Beck
ious genres, Mom+ Pop
and "Blue
Moon" seems
to foreshadow an acous-
tic/folk-inspired album to
come.
The song starts off slowly
with some picking on an
acoustic guitar and accom-
panying beats on the tom-
toms, with Beck following
shortly after. He solemnly
muses that he's "so tired
of being alone," setting
the tone for the rest of the
tune. The drums are hard
to notice, as the tom-toms
blend in with Beck's low
pitch and are overpowered

by the g'uitar and sparse
bass so that the snare seems
to be the only recogniz-
able contribution from the
drums throughout the cho-
rus. The song also features
tambourine and maracas,
and in combination with
staccato acoustic guitar
picking, gives off a folky
flavor.

MOM + POP
On the whole, "Blue
Moon," is a mellow tune, but
isn't necessarily stripped
down. While it's a laid back
track with a simplistic bass
line and no climax to speak
of, Beck's smooth, harrow-
ing voice and calming back-
ing vocals give satisfaction
to a lonely listener.

Netflix releases to find the movies
worth revisiting or discovering.

MANDARIN
"Grease"
As someone who at age 8 choreographed an
interpretive dance to "Summer Lovin"' in her
basement (playing both Danny and Sandy, natu-
rally), "Grease" seemed to be an obvious choice to
watch while stuck in the winter blues. There are
awesome dance numbers! And romantic beach
scenes! And skinny John Travolta's butt chin!
"Grease" is a timeless (and accordingly misogy-
nistic) portrayal of teen love, but it has a fresh
quality that keeps generations turning to it. Watch
it if you are anxious to lose yourself ina summer-y
land of Pink Ladies and Greasers; veer away if you
want some substance with your hot cocoa.

WARNER BROS
"She's All That"
It's the end of senior year and baby-faced Fred-
die Prinze Jr. is starting fresh, after his hottie girl-
friend cheats on him over spring break. He makes a
bet with his standard jock-jerk friends that he can
turn "ugly duckling" Laney Boggs into their Cali-
fornia high school's prom queen. Watch for the '90s
beach parties, gratuitous makeover scene and Paul
Walker in possibly his most thought-provoking role
ever. Ignore any themes or messages the film tries
to impart - change yourself and you will find love...
girls with glasses are by definition unattractive. Just
appreciate the blissful vibe of a SoCal summer and
Usher's screen debut as the school's DJ.

WARNER BROS PARAMOUNT
"Y Tu Mama Tambien" "The Wild Thornberry's"

Definitely the most provocative of the films
on this list, "Y Tu Mama Tambien" was director
Alfonso Cuarfn's debut film, and featured now
world-renowned actors Gael Garcia Bernal and
Diego Luna as privileged Mexican teens seeking
adventure and sex on a road trip to the beach. Dark,
funny and painfully real, these boys grow up - or at
least become a little more self aware - as theytravel
from their rich Mexico City through tiny, ram-
shackle towns. This may not be the tequila-soaked
and American-infested Cancan of spring break fan-
tasies, but "Tambien" is certainly transformational.

Nigel Thornberry's nose is a vast, unexplored
territory unto itself, but this film boasts more than
just an impressive schnozs. Yes, it's animated. Yes,
it's based on a Nickelodeon TV show. But "The
Wild Thornberry's" was one of our generation's
first tastes of adventure, of a life outside of suburbia
and Whole Foods. In the feature-length film, the
Thornberry's travel to Africa, where Eliza (voiced
by Lacey Chabert, "Mean Girls") talks to animals
and proves to be the most badass female role model
ever. Watch for the nostalgia, stay for the animal
absurdity and surprisingly good animation.
