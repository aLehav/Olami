The 
Michigan 
state 

legislature passed two bills 

to appropriate $150 million in 

response to the coronavirus 

pandemic.

On March 17, the House 

unanimously 
passed 
House 

Bill 4729. The bill appropriated 

$50 million to the Health and 

Human Services Department, 

which requires the funds to be 

distributed to critical health 

care providers in order to 

expand the state’s response 

to the coronavirus. It also 

allocated $75 million to the 

Department 
of 
Technology, 

Management and Budget and 

those funds are authorized for 

public health emergencies and 

related economic responses to 

various departments.

On March 30, the Michigan 

Senate passed Senate Bill 151, 

which created and distributed 

an additional $15 million into 

the 
Coronavirus 
Response 

Fund along with $10 million 

to other various departments, 

totaling state funding for the 

coronavirus pandemic to $150 

million. 

In a joint statement, Gov. 

Gretchen 
Whitmer 
and 

legislative leaders addressed 

the signing of the supplemental 

bills. 
The 
statement 
noted 

the funding will allow for the 

purchasing of medical supplies 

essential for Michigan to slow 

the spread of the virus.

“Today’s 
signing 
of 
two 

supplemental budget bills will 

provide new state funding of 

$150 million to bolster response 

efforts,” the statement reads. 

“To date, the state has already 

expended 
more 
than 
$130 

million to secure more than 20 

million masks, more than 2,000 

ventilators, nearly 9 million 

ounces of hand sanitizer, more 

than 255,000 boxes of gloves, 

2.4 million gowns, more than 

2,000 beds, 210,000 testing 

supplies, 3,000 thermometers, 

185,000 face shields, 22,000 

cartons of disinfecting wipes, 

as 
well 
as 
other 
needed 

supplies.”

With businesses temporarily 

closing 
and 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer’s Stay Home, Stay Safe 

Executive Order, many students’ 

on-campus jobs have been left in 

limbo.

When the news of moving to 

remote learning broke on March 

11, LSA freshman Zachary said 

he planned to stay on campus and 

continue working with MDining 

at South Quad Residence Hall. 

He has held this position since 

November and said he hoped to 

pick up extra hours in light of 

online classes and reduced social 

gatherings.

Burton said he didn’t have too 

many concerns about staying on 

campus initially.

“It was a little bit stressful, but 

I didn’t let it get to me that much,” 

Burton said. “After a certain point, 

you’re just like, ‘Okay, here we go 

again. Here’s another mess to deal 

with.’” 

However, 
as 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Housing 
encouraged 

people who are able to leave 

campus, Burton said he found 

himself feeling like one of the last 

people living in South Quad.

“I know everyone in my friend 

group left before I did, because I 

was intending to stay on campus,” 

Burton said. “I decided to leave 

once I realized that it’s going to 

shut down soon anyway.”

As for his job, MDining is 

allowing student employees to 

stop working if they leave campus 

while still being able to resume 

their job once they return to 

campus. According to Burton, 

the University Housing refund 

covered what he would have been 

making had he not taken on any 

extra hours.

Even so, Burton said he is still 

worried about not having an 

income at this time, especially 

since both of his parents had to 

stop working due to the pandemic.

“I still would have liked to make 

more (money) because my family 

situation is not really the best at 

the moment,” Burton said. “I want 

to help out with that but I can’t, 

really.”

LSA freshman Katie Carroll 

also had an on-campus job she has 

held since last semester working 

as a student-teacher classroom 

aide 
at 
the 
North 
Campus 

Children’s Center. It was during 

one of her shifts at the Children’s 

Center that she got news of class 

cancellation.

“It was a little nerve-wracking 

— the fact that our classes had 

been canceled and the University 

basically shut was emailed to us 

during my shift,” Carroll said. “The 

Children’s Center still couldn’t get 

permission to close for like five 

days beyond that, even though 

they’re part of the University … so 

a lot of the teachers were nervous 

about that.”

CAMPUS LIFE

For many students at the 

University 
of 
Michigan, 

summer is a time to gain 

experience in the real world 

through jobs and internships. 

However, 
as 
the 
number 

of COVID-19 cases in the 

United States and worldwide 

has continued to rise, many 

summer internships and jobs 

have been canceled, leaving 

some students scrambling to 

find other plans.

The Take Back The Night 

rally, usually held every year 

in Ann Arbor, was broadcasted 

on Thursday in a 29-minute 

YouTube video, including clips 

from keynote speaker Jaclyn 

Friedman, an activist for sexual 

violence awareness.

Presented by the Standing 

Tough Against Rape Society and 

the University Students Against 

Rape, 
the 
video 
contained 

messages 
from 
student 

organizers as well as from 

Pam Swider, STARS executive 

director and founder. 

The rally began with a message 

from Swider 

addressing 

the different 

format 
of 

the 
event. 

She 
said 

she 
hoped 

the 
video 

would uplift 

survivors 

and 
others 

tuning in. 

“Things 

are 
a 
bit 

different this 

year,” Swider 

said. 
“And 

though we’re 

not in the Michigan League 

ballroom like we planned, we 

are still here to come together 

to raise awareness about sexual 

violence, and most importantly, 

to uplift survivors and give 

them and you all watching hope 

during this time.”

Friedman acknowledged the 

fearful feelings of many in the 

public right now due to the 

current COVID-19 health crisis. 

She said the situation may be 

reminiscent of trauma to some 

viewers.

“This is probably rhyming 

with trauma, right?” Friedman 

said. “A lot of us feel out of 

control; we feel like men we 

don’t trust have a lot of control 

over our lives. It’s scary; it’s 

really scary. Some of us are in 

close quarters and can’t live 

with people who are not safe to 

us. So I don’t in any way want to 

minimize what we’re all going 

through right now.”

Friedman said survivors can 

utilize strength gained from 

past events during this time of 

stress. 

“We 
are 
survivors, 
and 

that means we know how to 

survive,” Friedman said. “So I 

want to really encourage you 

to spend some time taking care 

of yourself, and reflecting on 

what got you through the things 

you’ve survived already? What 

are the lessons you learned from 

that, that you can apply now?”

The 
event 
also 
included 

informational 
clips 
recorded 

by members of USAR meant 

to 
inform 
the 
audience 
on 

the different forms of sexual 

violence, such as trafficking, 

indecent exposure or sexual 

abuse. 

LSA junior Shreya Mullapudi, 

USAR’s grants writer, said sexual 

violence 
disproportionately 

affects certain groups, such as 

those from minority groups.

“Sexual 
violence 
pervades 

specific communities at higher 

rates,” Mullapudi said. “People 

in 
the 
LGBTQ+ 
community, 

people of color, people with 

disabilities, Native Americans, 

students 
in 
Greek 
life 
and 

many other people who sit at an 

intersection of these identities 

have a disproportionately higher 

risk 
of 
experiencing 
sexual 

violence in their lives.”

Additionally, 
the 
video 

featured a poetry reading from 

a volunteer member from USAR 

and a performance from the 

Detroit Women’s Chorus.

Art & Design senior Ariel 

Friedlander, 

senior student 

leader 
of 

USAR, 

thanked the 

sponsors 
of 

the 
event 

including 

Planned 

Parenthood, 

Drifter 

Coffee, 

Ann 
Arbor 

Tortilla 

Factory 

and Literati 

Bookstore. 

Friedlander 

also acknowledged Swider and 

her husband Tom Swider for 

founding this event 12 years ago.

“They have been such an 

incredible 
resource 
when 

it 
comes 
to 
knowledge, 

inspiration, courage, and just 

overall 
emotional 
support,” 

Friedlander 
said. 
“They’ve 

allowed us to hold this event and 

also so many others and they are 

the glue that keeps Take Back 

The Night Ann Arbor together, 

and we just cannot appreciate 

them enough.”

We are survivors, and that means we know how 
to survive. So I want to really encourage you to 
spend some time taking care of yourself, and 
reflecting on what got you through the things 
you’ve survived already? What are the lessons 
you learned from that, that you can apply now?


Besides being a valuable 

experience 
for 
learning, 

internships are often stepping 

stones to full-time job offers. 

In a survey conducted by 

the 
National 
Association 

of Colleges and Employers 

(NACE) in 2019, 57.5 percent 

of graduates in the class of 

2019 
who 
had 
internship 

experience received full-time 

job offers. 

LSA senior Nissa Thodesen-

Kasparian had planned for an 

internship at Estrel Berlin in 

Germany since October, with 

hopes of finding a full-time 

job in Berlin at the conclusion 

of her internship.

“My original plans for post-

graduation were to continue 

searching for a full-time job 

while in Berlin (through May 

and June) so that I could 

move 
onto 
this 
position 

immediately after I left the 

Estrel,” Thodesen-Kasparian 

said.

Now, she’s struggling to 

find alternative plans.

“The most jarring thing 

about this process then has 

been that now I am scrambling 

a bit to find another summer 

internship or full-time job, 

which is a bit difficult because 

a lot of deadlines have already 

passed and there’s still a 

chance summer internships 

even in Michigan might be 

pushed 
back,” 
Thodesen-

Kasparian said.

Other students, like LSA 

sophomore 
Josh 
Bauman, 

expressed 
worry 
about 

how 
the 
loss 
of 
summer 

opportunities 
would 

affect 
how 
graduate 
and 

medical 
schools 
evaluated 

applications. As a pre-med 

student, 
undergraduate 

research is often considered 

important 
for 
prospective 

medical and graduate school 

applicants.

“I was going to continue a 

(research) internship that I 

had from last year,” Bauman 

said. “I’d say I feel like some 

of my competitive advantage 

is being taken away against 

my will. Who is to say that 

my med school application 

might look weaker than it 

would have with a blank spot 

in the junior year summer 

slot where other students may 

have completed internships, 

published 
papers, 
studied 

abroad.”

For LSA sophomore Lena 

Vushaj, the cancellation of her 

summer internship working 

with the National Security of 

Albania to research archives 

from the communist regime 

was not only a loss of an 

educational experience but 

also a missed opportunity to 

explore her family heritage.

“My parents were from 

Albania and they experienced 

communist 
Albania, 
so 
I 

guess it was not only an 

educational experience, but 

it was more of an experience 

of personal growth,” Vushaj 

said. “And in the future I 

want to be a lawyer — maybe 

an immigration lawyer — so 

knowing what people went 

through 
and 
what 
made 

them the way they are today 

would’ve helped me better 

understand them.” 

Furthermore, the lack of 

communication 
between 

internships 
and 
students 

have left many frustrated. 

LSA 
sophomore 
Louie 

Orleans has yet to receive 

an official statement on the 

cancellation of his planned 

internship in Washington, 

D.C. 
through 
the 

University’s Public Service 

Intern Program. He said 

this uncertainty is hindering 

him 
from 
committing 
to 

alternative summer plans.

“Lots of the jobs and 

internships 
have 
gotten 

delayed or are unresponsive 

… I don’t have a summer job 

at this point, but I’m still 

uncertain if I can even take 

summer 
classes 
without 

knowing what’s happening 

with the program,” Orleans 

said.

Thodesen-Kasparian 

expressed similar thoughts. 

After 
receiving 
a 
mass 

email 
from 
her 
program 

coordinator, 
Thodesen-

Kasparian said she hasn’t 

received any further contact 

from anyone — including 

Estrel Berlin — addressing 

her individual situation.

“The most frustrating part 

of the whole process was the 

fact that I felt like I wasn’t 

really consoled individually 

about 
my 
internship,” 

Thodesen-Kasparian 
said. 

“I understand that there are 

limits to what the University 

can do and it made sense 

to cancel all internships en 

masse early on, but it was 

honestly frustrating to me 

that my internship and plans 

for my future were up and 

canceled on my behalf before 

I could really even consider 

alternative options.”

Despite 
the 
current 

environment, 
Thodesen-

Kasparian said she is thankful 

for her resources. 

“The whole situation was 

upsetting, 
but 
more 
than 

anything right now I’m just 

grateful that I’m back home 

with my family where I feel 

safe during these uncertain 

times because by no means 

is that everyone’s situation,” 

Thodesen-Kasparian said.

When the Children’s Center 

closed, Carroll said she and other 

employees 
were 
offered 
the 

option to work directly with the 

children at the Children’s Center 

as nannies. However, since she 

lived in a residence hall, she left 

campus and was unable to utilize 

this option. 

Besides 
the 
financial 
hit, 

Carroll 
said 
there 
was 
an 

emotional toll of having to leave 

her job. 

“I wasn’t expecting that I was 

going to get a job at a place that 

I love so much,” Carroll said. 

“It’s hard to not see those kids 

a couple times a week because I 

really did love my job … one of 

the favorite parts of my week is 

gone until further notice.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Trenten 

Ingell has continued his job as 

an organization peer advisor 

with the Center for Campus 

Involvement 
remotely. 
He 

recognizes he is in a better 

position than most students. 

In light of the situation, 

Ingell has worked on a number 

of petitions, including a call to 

stop on- and off-campus rent 

payments. 
According 
to 
the 

petition, these efforts hope to 

help students faced with the 

choice of staying on campus to 

work despite health concerns 

or going home and risking not 

being able to pay rent.

“A lot of people have lost their 

ability to work and provide at 

least some sort of income for 

themselves,” Ingell said. “I think 

that’s certainly been an issue for 

a lot of people.”

Ultimately, 
while 
Burton 

said losing his job temporarily 

has been difficult, he said he 

believes he can get through this 

challenging time. 

“Even though it’s a mess I’ve 

never dealt with before, it’s 

still a mess I can deal with,” 

Burton said. “We’ll get through 

it somehow.” 

 

In an interview with The 

Daily 
March 
27, 
University 

President Mark Schlissel said 

students who are not longer 

working won’t be paid, but noted 

the University is working to find 

a job for students who stayed on 

campus and wish to continue to 

work. 

“Work study is a work program, 

so if they’re not working I don’t 

believe we can pay them at home 

for not working,” Schlissel said. 

“But the students that are, we’ve 

endeavored to keep employed, 

because 
we’ve 
realized 
that 

many of the students rely on 

that income and a lot of it’s being 

done on a case-by-case basis.”

LSA 
junior 
Isabelle 

Bogojevic, 
communications 

chair for the policy group 

U-M Roosevelt Institute, said 

she 
appreciated 
Michigan’s 

localized efforts to the outbreak. 

“In regards to that $2 trillion 

that was passed, we know that 

it’s not being distributed to most 

college-age students and there’s 

a bunch of other shortcomings 

in that bill as well,” Bogojevic 

said. “While I think that the 

stimulus bill is going to be 

helpful for many … it seems to be 

a very short-sighted plan to me. 

So I think Gretchen Whitmer, 

like early on, did a good job of 

tackling this crisis. So I think 

that the state legislators’ action 

is just another way that the state 

of Michigan is responding.”

The 
Daily 
analyzed 

neighboring states’ plans to see 

how they stack up to Michigan’s.

OHIO:

The 
state 
of 
Michigan’s 

reaction 
to 
the 
coronavirus 

comes on the heels of Ohio Gov. 

Mike DeWine, who has been 

applauded 
for 
his 
proactive 

efforts in combating COVID-

19. On March 12, DeWine was 

the first governor to call for 

a statewide closure of public 

schools, even though Ohio had 

yet to suffer a major outbreak of 

COVID-19.

Both DeWine and the Ohio 

state legislature have worked 

together to enact House Bill 

197 
providing 
emergency 

relief to Ohioans during the 

COVID-19 pandemic. The bill 

amends several codes to expand 

unemployment 
benefits 
for 

individuals out of work due 

to COVID-19, prohibit water 

shutoffs, move the state tax 

deadline from April 15 to July 15 

and extend absentee voting for 

the Ohio primary to April 28. 

INDIANA:

In 
Indiana, 
the 
state 

legislature 
has 
not 
passed 

any relief for COVID-19. In 

an interview with TV station 

WXIN , state Rep. Jim Banks, 

R-Ind., said he is waiting to see 

how the $2-trillion federal relief 

package will impact the state 

before allocating more aid.

“I really do believe we need to 

let those three aid packages play 

out, then we can go back after 

that and see what needs to be 

done,” Banks said.

ILLINOIS:

The 
state 
of 
Illinois 
has 

paired up with the nonprofit 

United Way of Illinois and the 

Alliance of Illinois Community 

Foundations 
to 
launch 
a 

statewide 
fundraising 
effort 

to support nonprofits. Other 

than the partnership, the new 

fund would be separate and 

independent 
from 
the 
state 

as they hope to fundraise for 

providing emergency food and 

basic supplies, interim housing 

and shelter, primary health care 

services and other essential 

needs.

While 
Gov. 
J.B. 
Pritzker 

has 
filed 
for 
a 
waiver 
to 

expand Medicaid coverage and 

announced new measures to 

help small businesses struggling 

financially, 
the 
Illinois 

legislature has not passed any 

laws allocating funding for the 

coronavirus pandemic. 

All four states are under stay-

at-home 
or 
shelter-in-place 

orders.

n 
early 
March, 
Michigan 
Gov. 

Gretchen Whitmer declared a state 

of emergency in Michigan. Citizens 

are harboring unease and fear about the 

coronavirus pandemic. In an effort to flatten 

the curve, Whitmer enacted mandatory 

self-quarantine and social distancing for all 

people with nonessential jobs to try and limit 

the spread of the coronavirus. Since Gov. 

Whitmer’s order, Michigan has experienced 

10,791 confirmed cases of the virus and 417 

deaths as of April 2. While these numbers are 

substantial, it could have been much worse if 

the Michigan state government didn’t begin 

enacting these emergency measures to slow 

the spread of the virus.

For good reason, state and federal 

governments have assumed the responsibility 

of overseeing public health and safety as 

the dangers of the pandemic affect our 

country. Similar precautionary emergency 

measures are being taken in other states as 

well, attesting to just how dangerous the 

virus is and just how important our response 

to it is. From my position of privilege, I have 

thought about how effectively we could 

address our climate emergency if we took 

the same prompt and drastic action. One 

cannot deny that global climate change is a 

risk to all people just as a pandemic is a risk 

to all people. Therefore, one should trust 

that drastic measures could lift mankind 

out of the climate crisis just as these drastic 

measures are working to lift us out of the 

coronavirus crisis.

In upholding the law of the land, the 

United States Congress has recognized 

the severity of this pandemic. With limited 

internal gridlock, it has managed to pass 

legislation that addresses the drastic financial 

needs of this emergency. As a result, direct 

payments of $1,200 will initially be made to 

taxpayers with incomes up to $75,000 per 

year and overall unemployment benefits will 

grow substantially. It is commendable that 

our government is addressing the economic 

needs of the people who face massive 

upheaval as a result of unemployment. At the 

same time, I trust that if we all considered 

the climate emergency to be as urgent of an 

emergency as this pandemic, a provisional 

economic subsidy would, in fact, be feasible 

for our government and therefore not an 

insurmountable task.

Some people are reluctant to see the 

benefits of such emergency measures due to 

the compromises that they bring about for 

other circles of society, such as education, 

socialization and public security. Students 

everywhere are facing a sudden change 

in their academic landscape, with some 

institutions transitioning completely to 

online forms and some experiencing an 

abrupt pause altogether. As people continue 

to distance themselves from those they 

previously interacted with often, social 

media has become a necessary tool to 

socialize and maintain connection with 

others. In an effort to slow the spread of the 

virus nationwide and internationally, travel 

by way of any vehicle has been discouraged 

altogether until it becomes safer to gather 

in masses. While people are adapting and 

coping with these compromises, we still can’t 

ignore the fact that they are discomforting 

and inconvenient. For some, this is enough 

to argue that emergency measures should 

not be so restrictive or should not be taken, 

despite the obvious emergency.

While it has become uncomfortable to 

make these economic, social and educational 

changes, this doesn’t justify ignoring the 

danger of the pandemic. In his daily news 

conference, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo 

emphasized that he intends to prioritize 

saving lives over restarting the economy. 

Cuomo said, “If you ask the American people 

to choose between public health and the 

economy, then it’s no contest. No American 

is going to say, ‘accelerate the economy at the 

cost of human life.’ Because no American is 

going to say how much a life is worth.” None 

of us want to make these drastic adjustments 

to our lifestyles, but we are accepting that this 

is what we need to do for the greater good and 

for public health. Just as we accept that this is 

what needs to be done to persist through the 

pandemic, we should accept that we cannot 

ignore the emergency of climate change any 

I 

’m sure I’m not alone in feeling 

that it’s been difficult to focus 

on anything other than the 

coronavirus pandemic for the past 

two weeks. As much as I try to keep 

motivated, it’s almost impossible to 

stay present during a dragging Zoom 

lecture or a dense reading. My mind 

wanders and questions what these 

minor endeavors mean in the face of a 

worldwide crisis. Even my usual litany 

of distractions can’t offer refuge, with 

Twitter updating me on the death 

toll and Facebook bombarding me 

with coronavirus memes. For some, 

impacts have been far more severe 

than lack of motivation — they have 

lost jobs, homes, business and even 

loved ones to the pandemic.

The most radical change for many 

of us is being abruptly forced into 

stagnancy. But just because our lives 

have effectively been halted does not 

mean the world has come to a standstill. 

The Democratic nomination process 

marches 
on 
with 
frontrunner 
Joe 
Biden 

notably absent, the worst locust plague 

in decades is swarming in East Africa 

and the oil price war between Russia 

and Saudi Arabia continues. Events that 

would 
typically 
populate 
headlines 
have 

become secondary to the coronavirus 

coverage. Clearly, COVID-19 has 

consumed our lives and our news 

cycle the past several weeks — and it’s 

about to do the same to our health care 

system.

The situation in Italy provides a 

sobering glimpse of what could be in 

store 
for 
the 
United 
States 
in 
the 
coming 

days. Hospitals are overwhelmed, 

medical equipment is limited and 

medical staff are being overworked. 

This devastating example may soon be 

our 
reality, 
with 
the 
U.S. 
ranking 
first 
in 

the 
world 
for 
COVID-19 
cases, 
a 
number 

which will only continue to grow. 

Cases double every three days, a figure 

which is prompting hospitals to find 

as many beds as they can to prepare 

for an onslaught of critical patients. 

The 74,000 intensive care unit beds 

that operated in 2018 are insufficient 

to handle the coming crisis. And just 

as the world has not stopped turning, 

medical issues unrelated to COVID-19 

have 
not 
ceased. 
Cardiac 
arrests, 
cancer 

and childbirth will not simply yield to 

the viral event, and our medical system 

cannot divert all resources to fighting 

the virus without neglecting the needs 

of millions of Americans.

Overwhelmed 
health 
care 

infrastructure is not the only thing 

threatening America’s health — with 

the country focused on COVID-19, 

players with ulterior motives are 

presented an opportunity to discreetly 

alter health care for the worse. As 

difficult as it may be, we must remain 

vigilant and motivated in refusing to 

allow those in power to take advantage 

of this crisis by reducing health care 

accessibility for marginalized people. 

We cannot forget, even as we face a 

public health crisis, that health care is a 

human right we must always fight to 

protect. 

Just as many states, including 

Michigan, have ordered citizens to 

avoid 
all 
nonessential 
social 
interaction, 

U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams 

has urged that all “nonessential 

elective procedures” be canceled or 

delayed 
during 
the 
COVID-19 
outbreak. 

However, typifying all non-urgent 

procedures as “elective” is a dangerous 

move for health care rights after the 

crisis. The first thing that comes to 

mind for many people when they 

think of an “elective” procedure are 

those that are medically unnecessary, 

such as cosmetic plastic surgery. But 

the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 

Services’ 
list 
of 
postponable 
procedures 

includes colonoscopies and other 

endoscopies, 
cataract 
surgery 
and 
even 

low-risk 
cancer 
surgeries, 
all 
of 
which 
are 

rarely considered “unnecessary.”

One supposedly “nonessential” 

branch of medical care will likely 

get little mention by the Trump 

Administration — gender-affirming 

surgeries for transgender and non-

gender conforming individuals. The 

pandemic has shed light on how these 

necessary 
procedures 
are 
still 
considered 

“elective” 
by 
many 
practitioners, 
policy-

makers and medical institutions. 

Even in normal circumstances, these 

marginalized individuals often have 

their 
health 
needs 
invalidated 
and 
their 

procedures significantly postponed 

— sometimes for years — with 

devastating consequences. For trans 

patients 
that 
are 
already 
fighting 
to 
have 

their procedures considered medically 

necessary, allowing those in power to 

conflate gender-related surgeries as 

“elective” could present a dangerous 

blow to trans health rights. We need 

to make it absolutely clear that the 

term 
“nonessential” 
only 
applies 
within 

the limits of this crisis. And while we 

can acknowledge that delaying these 

procedures is a reasonable measure 

given the circumstances, we should 

also hold space for the anger and 

disappointment felt by those impacted 

and provide extra support during 

this difficult time. Most importantly, 

we must remain dedicated to 

advocating for these procedures to 

be considered essential after the crisis 

is over; they must be attended to in a 

timely manner, covered by public or 

private insurance and treated as valid 

by health care providers and systems.

Another 
already 
stigmatized 

medical issue exacerbated by the 

pandemic 
is 
abortion 
services. 
Already, 

state officials in Ohio and Texas have 

capitalized on this crisis and the 

“nonessential” mandate to further 

their anti-choice agenda. They claim 

to act under the initiative to preserve 

medical resources for COVID-19 care, 

but their true motives are incredibly 

transparent given their recent efforts 

to severely limit and penalize the right 

to choose. Their categorization of 

abortions as nonessential goes directly 

against a recent statement by the 

American College of Obstetricians 

and Gynecologists which deems 

abortion “an essential component 

of comprehensive health care,” one 

which must be maintained during this 

crisis. Moreover, these procedures use 

relatively few medical resources and 

are inherently time-sensitive. For now, 

Planned Parenthood is fighting back 

against these dangerous mandates. 

Unfortunately, Ohio and Texas are 

just two of several states which have 

been relentlessly chipping away at 

women’s rights, and more states may 

follow their example in the future. As 

such, we must be prepared to continue 

supporting Planned Parenthood and 

other abortion providers throughout 

the duration of the crisis, ensuring 

women have access to essential health 

care services and making it clear to 

lawmakers that their efforts to take 

advantage 
of 
a 
crisis 
to 
diminish 
human 

rights 
have 
not 
gone 
unnoticed, 
nor 
will 

they continue without a fight.

Facing the reality of a global health 

crisis can certainly make finding 

motivation difficult, but even as we 

are socially isolated, our interest in the 

common good can bring us together. 

Although 
we 
are 
physically 
apart, 
we 
can 

stand in solidarity for the right to health 

care. 
The 
forces 
working 
against 
human 

rights have not yielded to this crisis — 

in fact, many have found increased 

mobility as the global community 

is focused elsewhere. We, too, must 

mobilize, fighting against those who 

would take advantage of the crisis and 

working 
to 
fix 
the 
issues 
revealed 
by 
this 

pandemic. The world has not stopped 

moving forward — neither should we.

MUSIC REVIEW

Just a few hours before the release of his 

highly anticipated album Cezinas, Nicolas 

Jaar took to his blog to provide listeners with 

some background info. He wrote: 

“The music comes from a desire to feel 

everything -- a few years ago, I stopped 

drinking 
alcohol, 
smoking, 
consuming 

caffeine, eating animals, etc., and, for a period 

of time, I also quarantined myself alone 

somewhere on the other side of the world to 

be able to work on music for months on end. 

I didn’t want to keep feeding the system. Its 

[the system’s] hunger, its past. I didn’t want 

to work from ambition. Where I would work 

to impress first, and love second. I wanted 

presence first. Love first. I thought that if I 

had this privilege and this luck, to be able to 

talk to people through sound, then I better 

work on myself & get rid of negative shards 

within me. I didn’t want to unwittingly throw 

[the shards] back into the world. Of course, 

this didn’t happen...the shards kept piling up 

and I had to accept the fact that the darkness 

that I was trying to get away from would 

always rear its head...Hopefully Cenizas 

only shows darkness so as to show a path 

out of it. I want this music to heal and help 

in thinking through difficult questions about 

one’s self, and one’s relationship to the state 

of things. We are living in a time of complete 

transformation, a metamorphosis— and the 

transformations are happening within as 

well. There is potential for great healing and 

great destruction.

...

With love, Nico.”

Well, now certainly does seem like the 

perfect time for him to release this album, 

doesn’t it? In short, for Jaar (and hopefully for 

his listeners), Cezinas is a way of processing 

the darkness and realizing there is always a 

way through, no matter how dark it seems. 

The music, however opaque or murky, is a 

way of understanding why we have darkness 

and how it can transform us. 

It’s clear Cezinas is unlike anything Jaar 

has ever released. It’s unlike this year’s 

danceable but ominous 2017-2019, it’s unlike 

2018’s 2012-2017, it’s unlike 2016’s political, 

vocal-focused Sirens, it’s unlike any of the 

multitudinous EPs and it’s certainly unlike 

his psychedelic, guitar-driven side project 

Darkside, yet somehow, it’s distinctly Jaar. 

Jaar is in total control on Cezinas, just like 

he is on his other projects. It’s undeniable. 

As always, he precisely executes his vision 

exactly as he envisions it, never compromising 

for the sake of accessibility. Like he said in his 

blog post, the album is dark, but it’s only dark 

as a means to show that the light is always 

present, regardless of how far off it seems. 

Opening track “Vanish” sets the tone of 

Cezinas (Spanish for “ashes”) in concrete. It 

begins with a droning, haunting instrumental 

that sounds like the sonic representation of 

darkness, but it eventually gives way to an 

airy, desperate chorus of Jaar’s voice that 

pleads, “Say you’re coming back / Say you’re 

coming back / Say you’re coming back / Say 

you’re coming back / Say you’re coming back.” 

It ends just as the final repetition rings out 

and then transitions to “Menysid,” an almost 

industrial instrumental filled with stinging 

whirrs and buzzes while a barely-there 

synth line trudges along in the background, 

like an ever-present, dim light. Title track 

“Cenizas” continues to build on the droning 

atmosphere, but Jaar establishes a sense of 

fear by questioning the fate of humanity as 

the world shrinks and crumbles, singing, 

“In the ashes / We are going to assemble / 

Knowing nothing / Is better.” 

The fear and uncertainty continues to 

manifest and eventually culminates with 

“Mud,” Cezinas’s crushing centerpiece. The 

darkness has reached its high point, made 

clear as Jaar repeatedly warns that “There’s 

something in the mud.” Once the vocals 

totally fade, the track becomes brighter and 

more vibrant, as if to say whatever it is in the 

mud is completely obscured, but still there 

regardless. All that needs to be done is to get 

it out. 

As Cezinas goes on, it slowly begins to fill 

with light, though the darkness still prevails. 

“Sunder” and “Hello, Chain” are the one-two 

punch that was needed to drive the album 

closer to its conclusion. “Sunder” features a 

hypnotizing repetition of ascending keys as 

Jaar begins to figure that his path through 

the darkness depends on no one other than 

himself. The same can be said of “Hello, 

Chain,” with its heavenly layered chants, 

patiently oscillating synthesizer and lyrics 

that suggest the only way to the light is 

patience.

The final three tracks are like the final 

push out of the darkness. On “Garden,” 

the light, though still far away, makes its 

presence abundantly clear. “Xerox” is the 

last violent drag out of the darkness toward 

the gateway to the light, and “Faith Made 

of Silk” is the act of moving through the 

gateway and leaving the darkness behind. 

“Faith Made of Silk” comes as a sudden burst 

at the end of the album. It’s not a celebratory 

song, though. Instead, it’s a cautionary one. 

Jaar’s lyrics make it obvious that the act of 

leaving the darkness is not about making sure 

that it never returns. He sings, “Look around 

not ahead / (You have nowhere to look) / A 

peak is just the way towards / A descent,” 

reminding listeners not to fall prey to any 

darkness that may lurk ahead because after 

every peak of light lies a descent filled with 

uncertainty. That is to say, it’s useless to 

look ahead. It’s more beneficial to recognize 

everything they’ve overcome and remember 

the people and events that eventually got 

them to the light, just in case they find 

themselves or anyone else trapped in the 

darkness somewhere down the road.

Though not as danceable or accessible as 

Jaar’s previous releases, Cezinas is without 

a doubt his most powerful. Jaar manages 

to make darkness palpable in every song, 

yet somehow he is skilled enough to make 

sure the light is always present, no matter 

how obscured it may be. The album itself is 

a representation of the transformation we 

undergo as we deal with darkness in our lives. 

Each individual song is either a representation 

of the healing or the destruction that occurs 

during a hellish journey to the light. It goes 

without saying, Cezinas is the perfect album 

for the world today as humanity navigates 

through the seemingly ever-present darkness 

toward the light, wherever it may be.

FILM NOTEBOOK
A24 films streaming on Amazon Prime: A breakdown

DAILY FILM WRITERS

The Michigan Daily Arts Section

In the absence of new theatrical releases, 

a few of us on the film beat decided to 

break down our favorite A24 films that are 

streaming on Prime Video. 

*

“Venus, planet of love / 

Was destroyed by global 

warming / Did its people 

want too much too? / 

Did its people want too 

much?” go the lyrics of 

Mitski’s “Nobody.” Love 

may not be the reason 

for 
our 
environmental 

issues on Earth, but in 

Paul Schrader’s (“Dog Eat 

Dog”) “First Reformed,” 

love is a kind of answer to 

them. Not romantic, or 

even platonic love, but a 

spiritual kind. And the 

truth is, “First Reformed” 

is a love story. The love a 

particularly fraught priest of First Reformed 

Church (Ethan Hawke, “Juliet, Naked”) has 

for his drink, for a young environmentalist 

couple who seeks his help, for the finite 

bounty of the Earth. But that love comes 

at a harrowing cost, and “First Reformed” 

gracefully dives into all the vile, violent 

darkness it promises. 

— Anish Tamhaney, Daily Film Editor

“High Life” sneaks up on you. It opens 

with Robert Pattinson (“The Lighthouse”) 

and a baby, living together in a tiny 

spacecraft. The baby is absolutely adorable, 

and things would be perfect if not for the 

endless, black silence pressing in against 

the ship’s walls, which director Claire 

Denis (“Let The Sunshine 

In”) takes great care to 

accentuate, and the look of 

devastation in Pattinson’s 

eyes. As the minutes tick 

by, one learns how these 

characters ended up light-

years away from Earth, 

all alone. It’s psychotic, 

horrific and deeply, gut-

wrenchingly 
human. 

Taking 
one-third 
of 
a 

movie to develop a sense 

of tranquility only to rip it 

away completely is the kind 

of audacious filmmaking 

that only comes from A24.

Arts Writer

My resolution for 2020 was to not have 

a crush on unattainable people — and 

then “Little Women” had the audacity to 

come out at the end of December. It was a 

perfect storm of the Tik Tok For You page 

algorithm and my weakness for celebrities. 

I was hooked on Timothee Chalamet. And, 

as I made my way through his repertoire, I 

discovered the gem that is “Hot Summer 

Nights.” At peak brooding nerd status, 

Chalamet embodies the best kind of 

protagonist — his confidence grows as he 

finds something he’s good at and he flirts his 

way through the summer. Saturated within 

an inch of its life, “Hot Summer Nights” is a 

film that made me nostalgic for the summer 

days filled with carnivals and a booming 

weed business that I never had. 

— Emma Chang, Daily Arts Writer

“The Killing of a Sacred Deer” is a 

wonderfully, unsettlingly bizarre time. 

Helmed by the absurdist indie director 

Yorgos Lanthimos (“The Favourite”) and 

starring Colin Farrell (“In Bruges”), it 

presents a deeply strange psychological 

thriller about a cardiologist and the 

peculiar relationship he has with the son 

of a patient that died on his operating table. 

Like Yorgos’s 2015 dystopian black comedy 

“The Lobster” (which is on Netflix and 

would make for a wickedly-weird Colin 

Farrell double feature), all the characters in 

the world of “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” 

speak with a deadpan, utilitarian directness 

that should be antithetical to the profession 

of the actor. It’s quite an acquired taste, but 

once you learn to listen the film is unlike 

many other thrillers. It’s got uncanny 

creepiness 
in 
spades 
and 
plays 
with 

uncomfortable themes of power, culpability, 

and justice, leaving one wondering what the 

hell they just watched.

“Spenser Confidential” is a terrible movie. 

Or, it’s perfect if you’re looking for a movie you 

can have on in the background while you scroll 

mindlessly through your phone. As much as 

I tried to understand what was going on, the 

entire film is a mess. Spenser (Mark Wahlberg, 

“Daddy’s Home”) is an ex-convict and ex-cop 

who is trying to track down the killer of the 

man who Spenser had been sent to prison for 

attacking. It sounds alright, if a little confusing, 

but in reality, it’s so 

convoluted and hard to 

follow that you end up 

on your phone instead.

As much as I love 

action-packed 
fight 

scenes, I’ll go out on a 

limb and say “Spenser 

Confidential” is more 

fighting than anything 

else. There is so much 

fighting that the plot 

gets lost amid scenes of 

Mark Wahlberg getting 

beat up. Along with the 

overabundance of fighting is an overabundance 

of characters, too many to really understand any 

one person’s role in the film. 

The main character besides Wahlberg’s 

Spenser is Hawk (Winston Duke, “Black 

Panther”). If I could, I would tell you what 

purpose his character serves. But I can’t, 

because in all honesty, I’m not sure there is 

one. Spenser lives with his friend Henry (Alan 

Arkin, “Argo”) who took on Hawk, a boxer who 

somehow can’t throw a punch, as a roommate 

while Spenser was in prison. How does Hawk 

get involved in Spenser’s investigation? I’m not 

really sure. It doesn’t make any sense. 

Frankly, I was counting down the minutes 

until this movie finished. I spent the first 

bit trying to pay attention, actually slightly 

interested in the back-and-forth, present-and-

past scenes, but eventually, I got bored. There 

isn’t enough that happens in the beginning to 

grab your attention, and there’s nothing exciting 

that happens later on to make you pay attention 

then. There isn’t a single character in this 

film that I actually liked. I didn’t hate anyone 

either, though. I barely felt anything. If I’m 

being honest, the only real emotion I felt while 

watching this film was 

astonishment because, for 

some reason, Post Malone 

was in it. 

The 
biggest 

problem with “Spenser 

Confidential” is that even 

when it’s on, it doesn’t 

feel like you’re watching 

anything. It’s background 

noise, something to have 

on while you complete 

a Canvas quiz (yes, I’m 

speaking from experience). 

You 
don’t 
grow 

emotionally attached to anyone or anything in 

the film; so little happens that eventually you 

forget you’re even watching it. 

Unless you really don’t want to watch a 

movie and just need something on to make 

background noise while you’re doing something 

else, I would without a doubt classify this movie 

as a ‘skip.’ 

Unless you really don’t want to watch a movie

FILM REVIEW

TV REVIEW
‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’ is not worth watching

MAXWELL BARNES

Daily Arts Writer

Probably the most easily recognizable 

title of the reality TV era, “Keeping Up With 

The Kardashians” recently began its 18th 

consecutive season. If you are a nonregular 

to reality shows but are aware of its campy 

tropes, you might already fully know what to 

expect from the Kardashian family’s boring 

and sometimes controversial livelihoods as 

socialites of the celebrity world. 

In the midst of crowded parties and 

fashion shows of New York, Kim, the show’s 

de-facto mascot of sorts, appears to feel at 

home in such a fast-paced environment. 

She’s mingling around and promoting the 

launch of her new slimwear line, SKIMS. 

As an audience, we’re given just enough 

detail about the progressive, body-positive 

message of the new clothing line to assume 

that Kim is rebranding herself as a reformist 

entrepreneur. 
However, 
little 
attention 

is given to the product after its singular 

mention when Kim receives a call from NBA 

player Tristan Thompson, her sister Khloe’s 

“baby daddy.” Kim invites Tristan to dinner 

and much to Khloe’s annoyance, and the 

two reconcile their broken friendship. This 

is a common trope throughout the series as 

the ongoings of the Kardashian brands are 

mentioned, but are overshadowed by the 

petty drama that viewers prefer.

For example, Kylie Jenner, the world’s 

youngest “self-made” billionaire, is shown 

preparing to travel to Paris to promote her 

cosmetics brand. The show then cuts to 

Kourtney and her newly formed bad attitude, 

which she adolescently uses to torment her 

sisters through her own laziness and apathy. 

Cut back to New York, where Kim and 

Tristan are having dinner at a lavish five-

star restaurant. Amongst all this, the family’s 

matriarch and publicist, Kris Jenner, checks 

in on each of her daughters. I wish I could say 

I’m merely summarizing these events in lieu 

of explaining them in full detail, but I can’t. 

There’s virtually no other information than 

what’s shown on the surface. Amongst the 

constant bopping of background music and 

cuts between cameras, It’s aggravating to 

stay tuned with regard to how little actually 

happens amongst all the sisters’ individual 

plotlines. 

While Kourtney’s egocentrism builds 

tension amongst the sisters, Kim eventually 

takes it upon herself to physically assault 

Kourtney in a less-than-convincing catfight. 

Khloe, who is present, does little to break up 

the altercation. The highest point of drama 

occurs when Kylie, who has fallen ill, alerts 

her mother that she can’t attend the fashion 

show in Paris to promote her brand. The 

audience might be eager to find out how this 

problem will be resolved, but we are left to 

“tune in next week” to find out. 

Perhaps this is why people watch. To an 

outsider, family quarrels existing at the 

richest level of American society might 

seem reassuring that life might not be so 

perfect in the highest tax bracket. The 

relationships among the main Kardashian 

trio of daughters appear to be rooted in 

their outright pettiness to each other. They 

act childish despite the vast monochromatic 

wardrobes and mansions they have at their 

disposal. But even if that mode of thinking 

was the case for viewership, would someone 

even want to watch 18 consecutive seasons of 

consistent feuding? 

It’s because “Keeping Up” feels like junk 

food for the eyes. It’s mindlessly entertaining. 

It mainly continues to exist purely as the 

central platform for the Kardashian brand, 

whether it be SKIMS or Kylie Cosmetics or 

for general clout when Kim needs to promote 

a fashionable Judy crisis kit in the midst of 

a global pandemic. Season 18 takes a shift to 

look at each of Kris Jenner’s five daughters 

as entrepreneurs and activists in their own 

right. Just last month, Kim was being praised 

for her endeavors in criminal justice reform, 

for which she advocated in a visit to the 

White House.

As long as “Keeping Up” endures, so too 

will the Kardashian’s relevancy. In season 

18, that relevancy will depend on how well 

a new, enterprising slant is received by 

audiences. And if seeing one reality TV 

star behind the white house podium wasn’t 

already enough for you, maybe try to keep up 

with the Kardashians a little less.

Back home, on recreating 
my freshman year dorm

In these uncertain and lonely times, I 

find joy in my photos and string lights. 

When I packed up my dorm room and 

flew home to Seattle, I was aware that I 

would not be returning to 

freshman year as I knew 

it. Waiting for me was 

my childhood bedroom, 

nightly 
dinners 
with 

family instead of friends 

and a three-hour time 

difference. As I stared 

at the blank pink walls 

of my room on my first 

night home, I attempted 

to mentally prepare for my 

first online class the next 

day. Regaining a feeling of 

normalcy might actually 

be 
pretty 
difficult. 
I 

decided the first step to 

feeling motivated to finish 

out the semester was to 

make the place where I 

grew up feel a little closer 

to my room back in South Quad. 

Aside from the fact that I definitely 

have a little more closet space here and 

no longer share my space with another 

student, I figured my room at home didn’t 

have to be all that different from my dorm. 

I could hang some command hooks, find an 

outlet for my Christmas lights, and put up 

the obligatory freshman dorm tapestry; I 

could even put my name tag on the outside 

of my door. 

My favorite part of the decorating process 

was spending a considerable amount of 

time picking my favorite photos from my 

first year of college to print out. In my rush 

to pack up everything and leave campus, it 

was hard to make time to actually reflect 

on my experiences and why I was so sad 

to leave. Now that I’m back in my eerily 

quiet house, though, that’s pretty much 

all I think about. Looking 

back at photos from the 

fall and winter was such 

a great way to remember 

all of the fun adventures 

from before the pandemic. 

At school, I had taped 

photos of my friends from 

high school on my wall to 

remind me of home. Now 

these are mixed in with 

new ones that remind me of 

Ann Arbor. It makes me so 

happy to sit at my desk and 

glance up at photos of my 

new friends smiling in the 

Big House hanging next to 

photos from high school 

graduation and prom. 

When 
I 
fall 
asleep 

now it is to the sound of 

rain on my roof instead of the music and 

footsteps of the people in the room above 

me. Every morning I slowly make my way 

downstairs to a quiet breakfast with my 

siblings instead of the laughter and gossip-

filled morning meals with friends in the big 

orange booths of the dining hall that I had 

grown so accustomed to. But when I walk 

back up to my room and open my laptop to 

listen to my 1 p.m. philosophy lecture, I am 

comforted by the fact that at least my walls 

look a little like how they did in Michigan.

With vision in place, Gattis’s offense ready for next step in 2020

At this time last year, Josh 

Gattis fielded questions for 

the first time since joining 

the Michigan football team 

two months earlier.

As 
the 
Wolverines’ 

newly-minted 
offensive 

coordinator leaned on a glass 

timeline of the program’s 

history 
at 
the 
Towsley 

Museum, he prepared to 

speak to reporters about 

modernizing 
Michigan’s 

traditional offense.

But 
before 
unveiling 

his plans to revamp the 

Wolverines’ 
system, 

Gattis told of a different 

assignment. 
After 

luring Gattis away from 

his 
previous 
role 
as 
a 

co-offensive 
coordinator 

and wide receivers coach 

at 
Alabama 
in 
January 

2019, Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh brought him on a 

two-week road trip.

“That (trip) was really 

valuable,” Gattis said in 

March 2019. “That really 

developed our relationship. 

... It was just two guys in 

a rental car going across 

the country to see recruits. 

In that time, we were just 

sitting back in the car, 

joking, and it really enabled 

us to develop a friendship 

and really gave us a chance 

to get to know who we 

are 
from 
a 
personality 

standpoint.”

More 
importantly, 
it 

was during that trip when 

Harbaugh handed Gattis 

the 
keys 
to 
Michigan’s 

offense, 
relinquishing 

control 
to 
a 
full-time 

offensive play-caller for the 

first time since returning to 

Ann Arbor in 2015.

Even with a clear vision 

in 
place, 
Gattis’s 
first 

season calling the shots 

was anything but a smooth 

go-around. 
There 
were 

kinks to work through and 

an identity to find, and 

Gattis needed to experience 

the ups and downs to figure 

them out.

After it took his unit 43 

minutes to score in a three-

possession blowout loss at 

Wisconsin, he moved down 

from the coaches box to the 

sideline the next week. For 

him, calling the shots from 

there felt more natural than 

watching through a glass 

panel overhead.

But by now, that learning 

curve is in the rearview 

mirror. And coming off a 

season in which Michigan 

finished seventh in the Big 

Ten in total offense, there’s 

reason to believe the 2020 

Wolverines can take a step 

forward in that department. 

With a system now firmly in 

place, the roster has taken 

upward of a year’s worth of 

reps and the focus on the 

recruiting trail has shifted 

toward bringing in speedy 

players that fit Michigan’s 

new mold, such as incoming 

freshman 
receiver 
A.J. 

Henning.

And even while learning 

new 
dimensions 
of 
the 

offense on the fly a season 

ago, the Wolverines showed 

flashes. In the four games 

leading up to Thanksgiving, 

Michigan 
averaged 
41.5 

points and over 400 yards 

of total offense in blowout 

wins over Notre Dame, 

Maryland, Michigan State 

and Indiana.

Now that Gattis has a 

feel for play-calling, he’s 

more equipped to ensure 

his weapons are optimized. 

Proof of that lies in the 

evolution of how Gattis 

used pieces like sophomore 

receiver 
Giles 
Jackson, 

whose 
progression 
from 

kick returner to downfield 

threat 
unlocked 
a 
new 

dimension of the offense. 

By November, Gattis had 

designed jet sweeps and 

wheel routes specifically 

for 
Jackson’s 
open-field 

speed.

This fall, Gattis will have 

a 
speedster 
in 
Jackson, 

vertical threat in senior 

wideout Nico Collins and 

junior slot receiver Ronnie 

Bell at his disposal to break 

defenses down in different 

ways. In the backfield, he’ll 

look to maximize two proven 

returners 
in 
sophomore 

Zach 
Charbonnet 
and 

redshirt sophomore Hassan 

Haskins, while mixing in 

senior Chris Evans’s pass-

catching ability.

The 
Wolverines 
have 

not yet named a starting 

quarterback for 2020, and 

with all spring practices 

canceled due to the COVID-

19 outbreak, it’ll be a long 

time before they do. But 

redshirt 
junior 
Dylan 

McCaffrey 
and 
redshirt 

sophomore 
Joe 
Milton 

will both be duking it out 

for the right to lead a unit 

that’s more than capable of 

breaking through.

At the center of it all lies 

the man with the keys.

Offensive coordinator Josh Gattis will be in his second year at Michigan in 2020 after an up-and-down 2019.

Breaking down Michigan football’s 2021 recruiting class

Sports are on hold for 

the foreseeable future. The 

NCAA has established a 

recruiting 
dead 
period, 

banning both campus visits 

for recruits and in-home or 

school visits for coaches until 

May 31. Yet, the uncertainty 

surrounding 
COVID-19 

hasn’t 
stopped 
recruits 

from committing to their 

preferred schools.

In the past two weeks, 

Michigan has secured four 

commits in the class of 

2021 — defensive lineman 

Dominick Guidice, offensive 

lineman Greg Crippen, tight 

end Louis Hansen and punter 

Tommy Doman — giving the 

Wolverines a total of six in 

the class. The Daily breaks 

down Guidice, Crippen and 

Hansen and how they could 

add to the team.

Defensive 
lineman 

Dominick Guidice

Guidice, 
a 
three-star 

defensive end from New 

Jersey, was a bit of a surprise. 

Most of his previous offers 

were from service academies, 

the Ivy League and MAC 

schools. 
Competing 
for 

Mater Dei Prep, a small 

school in Monmouth County, 

Guidice is the current New 

Jersey sack leader. However, 

Guidice 
told 
Rivals 
that 

Michigan sees him as a likely 

three-technique at the next 

level.

According 
to 
Rivals, 

Guidice grew up a Michigan 

fan but has not yet taken an 

official visit. Last Tuesday, he 

was offered a scholarship on 

a group FaceTime call with 

head coach Jim Harbaugh, 

defensive coordinator Don 

Brown and defensive line 

coach Shaun Nua. After a 

brief discussion with his 

parents, Guidice committed 

that same night.

“I 
was 
really 
happy 

because Michigan was my 

dream school,” he told Rivals.

It is unclear how much 

playing time Guidice will 

get with the Wolverines 

given the presence of better 

defensive line prospects on 

the roster, but Michigan has 

a good history of finding 

underrated 
East 
Coast 

players, and presumably its 

coaches think Guidice is 

next.

Offensive lineman Greg 

Crippen

Crippen 

is a four-star 

offensive 

lineman from 

IMG Academy 

in Florida. He 

was previously 

committed 

to 
Notre 

Dame 
before 

re-opening his recruitment 

on Mar. 4.

Crippen is a big get for 

the 
Wolverines, 
having 

held offers from Alabama, 

Auburn, Ohio State and USC 

among others. He is likely 

a guard or center in college 

and is ranked as the No. 11 

guard in the 

country 
by 

247Sports.

According 

to 247Sports, 

Crippen has 

already been 

on 
campus, 

visiting 
for 

last 
year’s 

Middle 

Tennessee game while still 

committed to the Fighting 

Irish. He appears to have 

been swayed by offensive line 

coach Ed Warinner’s recent 

work in developing his unit.

“You can see from this 

year’s (NFL) combine for 

Michigan, he will get you 

there with hard work and 

dedication,” 
Crippen 
told 

247Sports.

Crippen is the Wolverines’ 

second offensive line commit 

for 2021, joining four-star 

tackle 
Giovanni 
El-Hadi 

of Sterling Heights. Both 

could be big contributors at 

a position group that appears 

to be stacked for the near 

future.

Tight end Louis Hansen

Hansen is a four-star tight 

end from Needham, Mass., 

a suburb of Boston. He is 

ranked as the No. 8 tight 

end overall and the No. 2 

prospect in Massachusetts 

by 
247Sports. 
He 
chose 

Michigan over offers from 

Florida, Georgia, LSU and a 

host of Big Ten foes.

“Something I like about 

the offense is the way they 

utilize 
the 
tight 
ends,” 

Hansen 
told 
247Sports. 

“They often have multiple 

(tight ends) on the field at 

once, which provides an 

opportunity for early playing 

time. And they do a good 

job getting them the ball in 

space and allowing them the 

chance to make plays. … They 

have a great chance at being a 

very dynamic offense.”

Both Hansen and Crippen 

cited wanting to study in 

the Ross School of Business 

as playing a role in their 

decisions.

Hansen is just the latest 

big New England pickup by 

Brown, who is well known 

for his prowess at recruiting 

the area. Additionally, tight 

ends coach Sherrone Moore 

assisted 
with 
Hansen’s 

recruitment.

With the graduation of 

fifth-year senior tight end 

Nick Eubanks after the 2020 

season, the Wolverines will 

need new contributors at 

the position. Hansen likely 

won’t get immediate playing 

time given the presence of 

sophomore Erick All and 

redshirt 
sophomore 
Luke 

Schoonmaker, but he has 

all the tools to step into a 

starting role later on.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh has five commits in his 2021 recruiting class, with three committing this week. By contrast, Ohio State has 15.

I was really 

happy because 
Michigan was 

my dream.


Olivia Carter’s swimming career has been 

studded with peaks and relatively free of 

valleys.

The 
sophomore’s 
record 
shows 
no 

shortage of first-place finishes and record-

setting times. She’s represented two top-

tier collegiate programs, as well as her 

country, in competition. But any discussion 

of winning or losing overlooks her love of 

swimming.

“I love the feeling of being in the water, 

and having so much power to move that 

water,” Carter said. “It’s an unreal feeling.”

That’s why the lowest point in her career 

is right now. She’s been out of the water for 

more than two weeks — the second-longest 

such break since she was five. Without 

the dependable structure of practice and 

competition, Carter feels rudderless. 

COVID-19 took away her chance at a 

national championship last March and cut 

her first semester at Michigan short. For one 

of the first times in her life, Carter is staring 

down an obstacle she cannot overcome.

***

Carter joined her second swim team the 

same way she joined her most recent one: by 

having the confidence to go for it.

She began swimming in the summer of 

2004 in her hometown of Cary, N.C. At a 

meet that summer, an opportunity to swim 

on a year-round team presented itself in the 

form of a tent handing out gear.

“I grabbed a free cap,” Carter said. “And 

I ran up to my mom like ‘Look, I’m on the 

team! They accepted me, I’m on the team!’”

It wasn’t as easy as Carter thought; she 

still had to try out. But she made the team, 

securing the spot entirely of her own volition. 

The other constant in Carter’s pre-college 

life — homeschooling— also began around 

this time. 

“When I was in it, and actually doing the 

work, I think I might have had a different 

opinion on it,” Carter said. “But looking back 

on it, it really did shape who I am today.”

For Carter, the benefits of a homeschool 

education 
lay 
particularly 
in 
the 

extracurricular activities that it allowed. 

She accrued physical education credits by 

going flying with her father, a professional 

pilot. Trips to the zoo were frequent. But the 

fun stuff only happened when Carter made 

the deadline on her work — a responsibility 

she held. 

“It was really good for me to understand 

how to manage my time and manage my 

studies so that I could open up free time to 

do things that I wanted to do,” she said.

When her family moved from Cary to 

Greensboro in 2016, Carter began swimming 

at the Enfinity Aquatic Club. Training 

under Enfinity coach Korey McCulley, 

she shed more than five seconds off her 

200-yard butterfly time and wound up as 

the No. 11 recruit for the class of 2018 on 

collegeswimming.com. 

“With that team, and with that new 

coach, I was really, really able to achieve 

my dreams,” Carter said. “I had always had 

the dream, since 2008, 2012, of being on the 

Olympic team. … Once I started swimming 

with Enfinity … I started realizing that those 

dreams could actually come true.”

She committed to Georgia, along with 

three other swimmers ranked inside the top 

25. Carter more than held her own in the 

deep SEC; she won SEC Freshman of the 

Year, was named to the All-SEC first team 

and placed seventh in the 200-yard butterfly 

at the NCAA championships.

But Carter had committed as a junior in 

high school — the decision, which was the 

right choice for her then, didn’t age well. 

Academics weren’t the issue; while the 

more structured schedule and classroom 

environments were new to her, her prior 

education 
left 
her 
well-equipped 
for 

the challenge of college courses. It was 

something harder to quantify.

“Over the course of my freshman year, 

I didn’t quite feel like I fit,” she said. “The 

hardest part for me was admitting the fact 

that I didn’t feel like I fit. It’s one thing to 

sense it, but it’s another thing to come out 

and tell my parents, ‘I don’t feel like I fit 

here.’ I can’t say anything bad about the 

team; it was a totally personal decision.”

So Carter grabbed the bull by the horns 

once again, announcing her intent to 

transfer. Her original plan was to take an 

Olympic redshirt for the following season 

and train for Olympic Trials at Enfinity, 

but by early October 2019, she committed to 

Michigan.

***

Before she stepped foot in Ann Arbor as a 

student for the first time, Carter had already 

made a strong first impression. 

She joined the Wolverines on their winter 

break training trip to Key Largo, Fla. In her 

Michigan debut at the Orange Bowl Classic, 

Carter set the meet record for the 100-meter 

butterfly. A performance like that appeared 

par for the course considering the high 

expectations of the Wolverines’ coaching 

staff.

“She swims a lot of different events, so 

she will be scoring a lot of points in different 

places,” Michigan coach Mike Bottom said 

after the meet.

Carter made good on these expectations 

by helping Michigan to a win in each of 

the season’s remaining dual meets. The 

Wolverines went on to take second place at 

the Big Ten championships, where Carter’s 

win in the 200-yard butterfly, fastest in 

conference history, fell short of the mark she 

wanted: a personal best.

“We had so much more to give,” she said. 

“So much more to give. It was really a big 

disappointment that we couldn’t win Big 

Tens, so I know that just added to the fire that 

we were going to put on at NCAAs. I am 100 

percent confident that we could have gone in 

there and absolutely dominated.”

Another personal goal — competing at the 

Olympic trials — was put on hold when the 

summer Olympics were moved to 2021. She is 

aware of the kind of work required to make 

that dream come true: increased attention to 

detail in the water, as well as weightlifting to 

strengthen her upper body. But right now, the 

quarantine is preventing Carter from getting 

back to work.

“(This) doesn’t feel temporary,” she said. 

“It feels like the end of the world.”

***

After a dual-meet win over Ohio State in 

January, in which Carter won the 200-yard 

butterfly, Michigan associate head coach Rick 

Bishop paid her the ultimate compliment.

“Obviously we’re better because of her 

performances in the pool,” Bishop said. “... 

but we’re just better because she’s a great 

contributing athlete and a great Michigan 

woman.”

Carter recognized the profundity of 

the ‘Michigan woman’ title. She’s been a 

Wolverine long enough to know that, but not 

long enough to feel comfortable attaching it 

to herself.

“I’m incredibly honored to have that title 

already,” Carter said. “I feel like I haven’t 

been there long enough to deserve that.”

It’s impossible to say when Carter will feel 

that she deserves it. But when she can get 

back to training, there is no doubt that she’ll 

begin attacking her long list of goals — setting 

a new personal best in the 200-yard butterfly, 

scoring points for Michigan at national 

championships and making the Olympic 

team — with at least equal, if not increased, 

drive.

She just needs a chance to move the water 

again.

For one of the 
first times in her 

life, Carter is 

staring down an 

obstacle she cannot 

overcome.
