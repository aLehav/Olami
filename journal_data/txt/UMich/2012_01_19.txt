Despite successes,
Snyder says
challenges still
remain
ByANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
LANSING -Inhis Stateofthe
State address last night, Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder urged
members of the state House and
Senate to press forward on the
progress they forged last year,
claiming this year will be serve
as an opportunity to profit from
the foundation set in 2011.
Snyder presented promises
for the upcoming year while
reviewing failures of 2011,
focusing primarily on the econ-
omy and innovation. He pledged
that the opportunity was ripe
for "Michigan 3.0" - "a new era
of innovation" ushered in by a

reinvention of the state.
"2011 was focused on dra-
matic policy improvements over
a broken model of the past," Sny-
der said in the speech. "We set a
right course for the future. 2012
is about finishing that work,
the work left over from 2011
and tackling a limited number
of unaddressed challenges and
really making this year about
good government."
During his address, Snyder
spoke at length about what he
believes to be effective govern-
ment - a system that brings
the state prosperity and serves
its citizens - referencing last
year's accomplishments and this
year's ambitions.
Snyder praised last year's
budget, calling it "financially
sound" in the face of tough
choices and highlighted gains
in the state's economy. He noted
that the state's unemployment
rate dropped to 9.3 percent in

By JESSICA GELFARB
For the Daily
Between designing produc-
tive classroom activities, dis-
ciplining rowdy students and
more teachers have to juggle
a myriad of responsibilities. A

new program developed in the
School of Education aims to bet-
ter prepare teachers for these
challenges.
School of Education Dean
Deborah Loewenberg Ball, the
director of TeachingWorks, said
the program was developed in
collaboration with faculty in
the School of Education to offer
increased resources intended to
help train teachers, by focusing
on a new set of teaching prin-
ciples developedby the School of

Education that it view as essen-
tial to effective teaching.
"Essentially, the organization
is rooted in a set of core skills of
teaching effectively," she said.
"We build curriculum for help-
ing people prepare teachers to
do those things really well."

More than 75
companies visit to
recruit students
By ERIN FORSYTHE
For the Daily
With resumes in hand, stu-
dents in business casual attire
gathered at the Michigan Union
yesterday to mingle and vie for
interviews and internships at
the University's annual Winter
Career Expo.
The all-day expo is co-spon-
sored by the University's Career
Center and the Office of Multi-

Ethnic Student Affairs, and
brings more than 75 companies
to the University to hire qualified
students for full-time positions
and internships.
Juanita Bell, a representa-
tive for AT&T, was among vari-
ous corporate representatives
present at yesterday's fair, and
said she was searching for retail
sale consultants. Though AT&T
recruits from across the United
States, Bell said her success in
recruiting at the University in
past years at the expo proves the
potential of University students
in professional settings.
"We're looking for leaders,
individuals who are going to take

charge and continue togrow with
AT&T," Bell said. "(The) students
here are very professional. They
have great personalities and I
think that it would be a good fit."
Bill Burke, a representative for
Cisco Systems who was also in
attendance at the fair, also said
the University produces excep-
tional employees.
"(We're looking) for students
that have done well in school,"
Burke said. "We're looking for

we can tell quickly."
Burke also lauded the experi-

Keeping up with culture

What is the value for stu-
dents to learn about American
culture?
It provides students with a
sense of the variety of the cultur-
al conflicts that have been pres-
ent throughout American history.
There is not a singular American
culture, but a framework of gov-
ernment that helps to sustain
a sense of unity in the face of
diversity. Students read a variety
of opinions and study important
court cases that shine light on the
culture of a particular period.
What classes are you
teaching?
I am currently teachingAmeri-
can Culture 100. 1 am director of

the Program in American Cul-
ture, and I was the director of
the Native American Studies Pro-
gram from 2002 to 2005. I have
taught Native American history,
U.S. History 260 and graduate
courses about frontier history
and historical research methods.
What advice do you have for
students wishing to pursue a
degree in American Culture?
It's important to develop writ-
ing and critical thinking skills.
The American Culture Program
emphasizes ethnic and racial
diversity, and it is one of the most
diverse units at the University in
terms of the faculty and students.
This program is comprised of a

Obama rejects p
Keystone XL pip
Boehner, GOP review before a looming dead-
line forced on him by Republi-
critical of president's cans. His move did not kill the
project but could again delay a
decision tough choice for him until after
the November elections.
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a Right away, the implica-
politically explosive decision, tions rippled across the politi-
President Barack Obama reject- cal spectrum, stirred up the
ed plans yesterday for a massive presidential campaign and even
oil pipeline through the heart of hardened feelings with Canada,
the United States, ruling there a trusted U.S. ally and neighbor.
was not enough time for a fair For a U.S. electorate eager for


lan for
)eline
work, the pipeline has become
the very symbol of job creation
for Republicans, but Obama
says the environment and pub-
lit safety must still be weighed
too.
The plan by Calgary-based
TransCanada Corp. would carry
tar sands oil from western Can-
ada across a 1,700-mile pipeline
across six U.S. states to Texas
refineries.
Obama was already on record
as saying no, for now, until his
government could review an
alternative route that avoided
environmentally sensitive
areas of Nebraska - a route that
still has not been proposed, as
the White House emphasizes.
But Obama had to take a stand
again by Feb. 21 at the latest as
part of an unrelated tax deal he
cut with Republicans.
This time, the project would
go forward unless Obama
himself declared it was not
in the national interest. The
president did just that, reviv-
ing intense reaction.
"This announcement is not
a judgment on the merits of
the pipeline, but the arbitrary
nature of a deadline that pre-
vented the State Department
from gathering the informa-
tion necessary to approve the
project and protect the Amer-
ican people," Obama said in a
written statement. "I'm dis-
appointed that Republicans
in Congress forced this deci-
sion."
Republicans responded
unsparingly.
"President Obama is
destroying tens of thousands
of American jobs and ship-
ping American energy secu-
rity to the Chinese. There's
really just no other way to put
it. The president is selling out
American jobs for politics,"
House Speaker John Boehner,
R-Ohio, said. Insisting that the
pipeline would help the econ-
omy, he declared: "This is not
the end of the fight," signal-
ing that Republicans might try
again to force a decision.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov walks to speak ata news conference in Moscow, Russia, yesterday. Lavrov says

Russia threatens to block U.N.
plans to use force against Syria

p.-,

Foreign minister:
No justification
for interference by
foreign military
MOSCOW (AP) - Russia will
block any attempt by the West to
secure U.N. support for the use
of force against Syria, Russia's
foreign minister said yesterday.
Foreign Minister Sergey Lav-
rov said Russia's draft of a U.N.
Security Council resolution on
the violence in Syria that cir-
culated Monday was aimed at
making it explicitly clear that
nothing could justify a foreign
military interference. Western
diplomats said it fell short of
their demand for strong con-
demnation of Syria's President
Bashar Assad's crackdown on
civilians, that has left more than
5,000 people dead.
The Security Council has
been unable to agree on a reso-
lution since the violence began
in March because a strong
opposition from Russia and
China. In October, they vetoed
a West European draft resolu-
tion, backed by the U.S., that
condemned Assad's attacks and
threatened sanctions.

Lavrov said Russia would
reject any attempts at securing
a U.N. sanction for a military
interference in Syrian affairs.
"If some intend to use force
at all cost ... we can hardly pre-
vent that from happening," he
said. "But let them do it at their
own initiative on their own
conscience, they won't get any
authorization from the U.N.
Security Council."
Lavrov also said that Russia
doesn't consider it necessary to
offer an explanation or excuses
over suspicions that a Russian
ship had delivered munitions
to Syria despite an EU arms
embargo.
Lavrov told a news confer-
ence that Russia was acting in
full respect of the international
law and wouldn't be guided by
unilateral sanctions imposed by
other nations.
"We haven't violated any
international agreements or
the U.N. Security Council reso-
lutions," he said. "We are only
trading with Syria in items,
which aren't banned by the
international law."
Lavrov accused the West of
turning a blind eye to attacks by
opposition militants and sup-
plies of weapons to the Syrian
opposition from abroad.

"They are dodging the main
question - why we should keep
silent about the extremist oppo-
sition's actions against admin-
istrative buildings, hospital,
schools," he said, urging the
West to use its contacts with the
opposition to urge it to refrain
from violence.
He said that arms supplies to
the Syrian opposition are "unac-
ceptable and absolutely coun-
terproductive, because it only
fuels more violence."
Russia has been seen as a
backer of the Syrian regime
since the Soviet times when
Syria was led by Bashar Assad's
father, although Russian offi-
cials last fall hosted promi-
nent Syrian opposition leaders
in Moscow in a bid to sponsor
talks.
Meanwhile, activists said
Syrian troops have shelled
a town near the border with
Lebanon, and living conditions
were deteriorating there after
six days of siege.
A resident and activist of the
mountain resort of Zabadani
describes the town as a "war
zone." He says dozens of anti-
government army defectors are
deployed at the entrances to
prevent any attempt by forces
loyal to Assad to storm the area.

Organizers had touted the

Council on Jobs and Competitiveness yesterday.
Obam Va campaign launches
f irst television advertis ement

TV spot to air
in several states
including Mich.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Barack Obama launched
his first television ad of his re-
election campaign, defendinghis
energy record against criticism
from a Republican-leaning out-
side group in a sign that the pres-
idential race is entering a new
phase even though Republicans
have yet to pick a challenger.
The ad, released yesterday,
responds to a $6 million ad
campaign by a group backed by
the billionaire Koch brothers
accusing Obama of conducting
pay-for-play politics in the bank-
ruptcy of California energy com-
pany Solyndra, which imploded
despite a $528 million federal
loan.
Obama's ad opens by citing
"secretive billionaires attacking
President Obama with ads fact-
checkers say are not tethered to
the facts." It says that the presi-
dent has added 2.7 million clean
energy jobs while reducing the
nation's dependence on foreign
oil, calling Obama's record on
ethics "unprecedented."
The voiceover ends by say-
ing, "President Obama. Kept
his promise to toughen ethics
rules and strengthen America's
energy economy."
The Obama campaign has
bought ad time in Michigan,
Virginia, Ohio, North Caro-
lina, Wisconsin and Iowa and
on national cable television,
according to a campaign offi-
cial. The official spoke on con-
dition of anonymity and was
not authorized to speak pub-
licly about internal campaign
strategy.
Obama's campaign was
expected to launch the tele-
vision advertising today, the
official said, showing that the
president's advisers are moving
to directly rebut attacks from
super PACs and Republican
presidential candidates who
have assailed the president in
earlyvotingstates such as Iowa,
New Hampshire and South
Carolina. The ad comes in the
aftermath of Obama's decision
to reject a job-producing oil
pipeline running from Canada

through Texas, citing environ-
mental and public safety con-
cerns.
It directly responds to a spot
released by Americans for Pros-
perity charging Obama's cam-
paign with collecting funds from
Solyndra investors in exchange
for the large federal loan, which
failed to prevent the bankruptcy
and the loss of more than 1,000
jobs. "Tell President Obama
American workers aren't pawns
in your political games," the ad
says.
Americans for Prosperity, a
conservative group headed by
billionaires Charles and David
Koch, began airing the 1-minute
ad in the same six states where
Obama's campaign will run
its first advertising. The Koch
brothers' energy company has
bankrolled right-leaning causes
and drawn frequent criticism
from liberal groups.
Obama's new ad will be cou-
pled with stepped-up travel sur-
rounding Tuesday's State of the

Union address. The president
heads to Florida today and then
visits five states over three days
next week to discuss the policies
he'll pursue leading up to his re-
election campaign.
The president's advisers had
anticipated a lengthy fight in
the Republican primaries, but
the decision to begin airing ads
reflects the need to respond to
criticism from outside Repub-
lican groups and prepare for a
campaign against Mitt Romney.
The former Massachusetts gov-
ernor has won contests in Iowa
and New Hampshire and shown
strength in upcoming contests
in South Carolina and Florida,
giving him an inside track to the
nomination.
Obama has raised more than
$220 million for his campaign
and the Democratic National
Committee through the end of
2011, giving him a strong founda-
tion to run a national campaign
across the airwaves and on the
ground.

Special review
teams now examine
all correspondence
FORT MEADE, Md. (AP) - A
copy of a magazine published by
an arm of al-Qaida made its way
to a terror suspect at the Guan-
tanamo Bay prison, leading to
an inspection of cells and a con-
tentious new policy requiring
special review teams to examine
correspondence between prison-
ers and attorneys, U.S. prosecu-
tors said yesterday.
Navy Cmdr. Andrea Lockhart
told a military judge during a
pre-trial hearing that a copy of
Inspire magazine got into a cell.
She provided no details on who
received the magazine or how.
But she said the breach showed
that prior rules at the base gov-
erning mail review were not
adequate. Yemen's al-Qaida in
the Arabian Peninsula launched
the online, English-language
magazine in 2010. An early issue
contained tips to would-be mili-
tants about how to kill U.S. citi-
zens.
Lockhart is part of the U.S.
team prosecuting the case
against Abd al-Rahim al-Nashi-
ri, a Saudi national charged with
orchestrating the attack in 2000
on the USS Cole that killed 17
sailors. Al-Nashiri, 47, is consid-
ered one of the most senior al-
Qaida leaders. He has been held
at the U.S. Naval Base in Guan-
tanamo Bay, Cuba, since 2006
after spending several years held
by the CIA in a series of secret
prisons.
Rick Kammen, a civilian
attorney for al-Nashiri, told
reporters on that his client was
not the recipient of the maga-
zine and was not involved in the
incident.
How mail between Guantana-
mo prisoners and their attorneys
should be handled consumed
several hours of the al-Nashiri's

pre-trial session Tuesday and
yesterday. At issue is whether
even a cursory examination of
the legal correspondence vio-
lates the attorney-client privi-
lege.
The dispute reflects the
untested nature of this latest
attempt to resume the military
tribunals at Guantanamo. The
prosecution of al-Nashiri is
already underway and the U.S. is
preparing to prosecute five other
prisoners accused in the Sept. 11
attacks, yet defense lawyers and
government prosecutors are still
fighting to establish basic legal
ground rules.
The military commission
system has been revised by the
Obama administration and Con-
gress, which has refused to allow
the administration to move pris-
oners from the American base
in Cuba. The trial system is still
sharply criticized by civil and
human rights groups and defense
lawyers who say the procedures
favor the prosecution. Kammen
has called the military commis-
sions a "second-class system of
justice."
But former members of the
Cole crew and family members
of several of the sailors killed on
the ship who spoke to reporters
at Guantanamo yesterday said
al-Nashiri is getting better legal
treatment than he deserves. "It's
been over 11 years now since the
Cole was bombed," retired Chief
Petty Officer Paul Abney said.
He urged that the military
commission be allowed to do its
work, adding: "They are doing
their job to be as fair and honest
as possible."
Al-Nashiri's defense team,
as well as the lawyers for other
Guantanamo prisoners and
the chief defense counsel for
the military commissions, are
opposed to the security review
of legal mail, which was put in
place last month by Navy Rear
Adm. David Woods, the prison
commander.

Snyder's address glossed over the state's realities
ften, politicians are accused of sugarcoating messages and
relying on buzzwords in public appearances. By skirting the
issues at hand, they attempt to trick the public into excite-
ment about their rhetoric and they ignore actual policy. The exhila-
rating exoskeleton of the speech becomes bigger than its substantive
center. Last night, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder attempted to do just
this during his second State of the State address. The governor's tone
underlined many positive changes in the state. The overall speech and
call for "Michigan 3.0," however, ignored many realities Michigan
residents face and glossed over problems created by the Republican-
controlled Legislature's dramatic budget cuts.

Necessary takeovers

When I was a kid, I loved
Star Trek. In one of
the movies, the crew
of the Starship
Enterprise goes
back in time to
the 1980s and
one of the crew-
members, Lt.
Chekov, injures
his head in a
nasty fall. As the
doctors of the MATTHEW
1980s prepare to ZABKA
drill a hole into
the unconscious
Chekov's skull in order to relieve
pressure building on his brain, the
Enterprise's Dr. McCoy busts into
the operating room and accuses the
doctor holding the drill of being
barbaric, shouting, "Drilling holes
in his head is not the answer!"
In the movie, Dr. McCoy has
some futuristic device to save
Chekov. But what if McCoy had no
such device and still shouted that
what the doctor was doing was,
"not the answer?" Certainly drill-
ing into somebody's head is never a
great solution, but should the doc-
tor have put down his drill and let
Chekov die instead?
Monday's protests reminded
me of this scene, as about 1,000
protesters who oppose Public Act
4 marched to Governor Snyder's
home and claimed P.A. 4 was not
the answer. Rather than focusing
on a law's imperfections, society
should form opinions about a law
based on competing alternatives.
Newspaper reports, including one
from The Michigan Daily, state that
P.A. 4 allows an emergency finan-
cial manager to "temporarily replace
elected city officials." This isn't quite
true. Michigan's emergency finan-
cial manager law, Public Act 72, was
adopted in 1990 - more than20years
before P.A. 4 became law. Under P.A.
72, Michigan's governor may appoint
an EFM to fix the finances of severely
indebted units of local government,
such as cities or public schools. The

appointed EFM had sole power over
the unit's finances. The goal was to
prevent these units from having to
declare bankruptcy.
Since units of local government's
outlays are often dominated by
union contracts - which an EFM
could not touch under P.A. 72 - the
original law's effectiveness was
often limited and was thus amended
by P.A. 4. The amendments grant
EFMs additional powers to dissolve
union contracts and amend pensions
within certain restrictions.
Detroit Public Schools are an
example of the success achieved
under P.A. 4 that was not possible
under P.A. 72. Years of mismanage-
ment and declining enrollment had
left DPS' finances in a mess, and
balancing its budget required cuts
to unionized employees' pay and
benefits. Under the old law, DPS' for-
mer EFM could not force these cuts,
and unions had no reason to accept
lower wages. But almost immediately
after P.A. 4 was passed, a new union
contract was signed. Unions specifi-
cally cited P.A. 4 as the reason they
agreed to necessary concessions, and
the system's new EFM, Roy Roberts,
announced in November that DPS
finally have a budget surplus.
Detroit appears poised to next
receive an EFM, and Snyder has
asked for a financial review of the
city, which is the first step in the
appointment process. Similar to its
school system, years of fiscal mis-
management and a declining popula-
tion have driven Detroit to financial
distress. The situation is so dire that
it now issues bonds to service its
debt. Were a private company in this
situation, bankruptcy would be near.
Wages and pensions already
account for more than half of city
outlays, and these expanding legacy
costs are expected to increase this
number to over 70 percent. Balanc-
ing Detroit's budget without cut-
ting union wages and benefits isn't
possible.
Should Detroit's elected and
union leaders fail to balance the

city's budget, and were P.A. 4
repealed, any future Detroit EFM
could not implement these neces-
sary cuts. In this situation, the only
alternative is bankruptcy.
No city of Detroit's size has ever
declared bankruptcy, and it would
almost certainly be a messy pro-
cess, lasting months if not years.
In bankruptcy court, an appoint-
ed judge would replace Detroit's
elected leaders and force necessary
union concessions.
Emergency
managers have
no alternative.
These are the necessary alter-
natives society should debate: the
competing imperfect solutions of
emergency financial management
versus bankruptcy. Both solutions
remove elected leaders from their
positions, both solutions are messy
and neither solution is fair.
Unfortunately, no such discussion
is taking place. Instead we are bom-
barded with the problems of P.A. 4
with a complete disregard for what
would happen if no such law existed.
Rarely are solutions in public pol-
icy perfect, and it is easy to say an
imperfect solution is wrong if one
does not consider the alternatives.
Should Detroit's elected leaders fail
in their responsibility to balance the
budget, Detroit will be like Chekov
on that operating table and P.A. 4
like the doctor with the drill. Pro-
testers shouting that emergency fis-
cal management is wrong without
offering an alternative solution are
asking the doctor to put down his
drill and let Detroit die.

There is no denying that many of the posi-
tive aspects of the State of the State address
are commendable. Michigan's unemploy-
ment rate shrunk from nearly 11.1 percent to
9.3 percent last year. While this figure still
has considerable roorth for improvement, the
progress creates an encouraging environment
for businesses. Snyder also highlighted other
successes including a push to end population
flight, Michigan's bond rating improving from
"neutral" to "positive" and the continuation of
former Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm's
effort to increase foreign business partnership
and investment.
All of the figures, however, weren't as hope-
ful. Snyder pointed out that college readi-
ness among Michigan students is 17 percent
- a1-percent improvement from last year. The
governor said this "unacceptable" figure must
increase to 100 percent.
Aninsistence that all Michigan students are
prepared for higher education seems counter-
intuitive to Snyder's actions. Last year, public
funding to the University was cut by15 percent
- part of an unfortunate trend amounting to
a 30-percent drop in funding over the past 10
years. The historic cut prompted 6.7-percent
tuition increases for in-state students and a
4.9-percent hike for out-of-state students at
the University. Fundingreductions also result-
ed in higher tuition at public universities state-
wide. These drastic tuition hikes make higher
education less accessible for a state still finan-
cially struggling.

Synder has played a significant role in
facilitating less-affordable education in
Michigan. Championing college readiness
holds little merit while working against col-
lege affordability.
The state Legislature was quick and effi-
cient last year, Snyder pointed out several
times in his speech. They passed 323 acts and
a "sensible" budget. Painting this picture of
a harmonious and economical Legislature
ignored that it's much easier to move quickly
when the governor, House and Senate are
controlled by the same party. For the first
time in years, Michigan has a budget sur-
plus, but at the expense of many public ser-
vices and programs that help lower-income
residents. Republican-led tax restructuring
gave tax credits to corporations and favored
out-of-state businesses. These measures were
hardly bipartisan.
It was bold of the governor to take credit for
Michigan's new anti-bullying law. This legisla-
tion nearly included an exemption for bullying
grounded in religious belief - legalized bully-
ing of LGBT students. Thankfully, this provi-
sion was removed before the bill passed.
Snyder does have reason to take a posi-
tive tone. Michigan's economic turnaround
is foreseeable. He can't forget, however, the
long-run benefit of investment in higher
education and that all of Michigan's citizens
- regardless of class, sexual orientation or
political affiliation - must be involved in cre-
ating Michigan 3.0.

PAUL RAYKOV

'Let's Go Blue'

Last Sunday, the University hockey team
went to Cleveland to face the Ohio State
Buckeyes in an outdoor venue at the Indians'
baseball stadium, Progressive Field. The park
had been transformed into a winter wonder-
land including an ice skating course billed as
the moving mile, a sledding ramp with inner
tubes and a hockey rink. The Wolverines won
the game convincingly 4-1 over the Buckeyes.
Another story remains to be told.
At 3:30 p.m. on Sunday afternoon, a small
contingent of the Michigan band came to
Houlihan's restaurant where the faithful were
gathered prior to the game organized by the
Cleveland chapter of the Michigan Universi-
ty's Alumni Association. The band knew they
were in the right place when they saw a sea
of maize and blue in the land of the Buckeyes.
They played "The Victors" of course, followed
by "Let's Go Blue," and the place erupted with
emotion and pride. You could have blinked and
thought you were in Ann Arbor.
Every time I hear "Let's Go Blue," I think of
the first time I heard that song. No matter what
venue I am at, the song is played. I was a fresh-
man at the University in the fall of 1972, living
on the fifth floor of Bursley Residence Hall. I
was in the floor lounge, typing my English 150
paper that was due the next morning.
When I was halfway through the paper,
Albert Ahronheim - who lived two doors
down from me - came in with a tuba. Albert
was the drum major for the band, and he could
do 40 yards of back flips as the band marched
down the field. I have never seen anyone do
that since. Albert wanted to play a tune for me
that he wrote on a brown paper sandwich bag.
Of course, I thought, how am I going to finish
writing my homework assignment with a guy
playing a tuba?
Albert played the first four notes and the
tune sounded like nothing. Then he realized
that the brown paper bag was upside down.
He borrowed a pencil from me and wrote an
upward arrow on that bag to indicate the prop-
er orientation. Albert played a very short tune
maybe 10 notes onhis tuba. He asked me what I
thought of it. I said it was short but catchy. The
band played "Let's Go Blue" at the Big House
that weekend.

When I heard the song at Houlihan's, I was
instantly transported back to being a freshman
in 1972, hearing it for the first time. In retro-
spect, I was a witness to University history
being made.
I went to the game at Progressive Field, and
I was given a ticket by another Michigan alum.
Game time wind chill temperature was only 9
degrees, and you had to clear snow from your
seat. The familiar baseball field had been trans-
formed. I had seats low and close to the rink
near Michigan's blue line. The band was placed
in a corner, and their battery powered field
microphone - if it was on - was turned down
very low. The stadium system favored the OSU
band which made the "Script Ohio" on the ice
between the second and third period.
I went over to the band because you could
sit anywhere. In all of my student days, I had
never been that close to the band. I saw the
band director give hand signals to cue up the
band. "Let's Go Blue" is cued by putting your
hands to your head and waving the fingers like
moose antlers. Can you imagine playing fro-
zen instruments with fingers exposed to single
digit wind chills?
One of the band members asked me what
program I was in. I thanked him for thinking
that I was a student. I told him that I was an
alum. When I answered such questions during
my University days, I would say LSA pre-med.
He asked me ifI was successful and I said yes.
I told him his University education is highly
respected and that he would be able to do great
things. I would give anything to relive my days
at the University, so I told him to enjoy it. You
might not notice how fortunate you are to go
to a school like the University with academic
pressures like tests, classes and papers. But
someday, you will miss it.
Both our hockey team and marching band
represented Michigan well on that frozen
Sunday. I thank the Michigan community for
bringing a little of Ann Arbor to Cleveland.
Hanging out with the band, I even learned
a new cheer: "I am proud to be, a Michigan
Wolverine."
Go Blue!
Paul Raykov is a1976 University alum.

any of us have burdens
right out of college,
including getting a job,
moving out of our
parents' house
and, of course,
paying off our
student loans.
A seemingly
manageable task,
student loan
repayment in
2010 reached 8.8. JASON
percent - the PANG JAO
highest default
rate in history.
Federal loans, such as Pell Grants
and Leveraging Educational Assis-
tance Partnership grants, support
most students, but they can't alone
cover the pricey textbooks, costly
lectures or the expensive meals at
the Hill Dining Center.
According to Sallie Mae's national
study, "How America Pays for Col-
lege," the average American student
borrows nearly twice as much from
outside sources as he or she does
from the federal government. These
sources include private educational
loan originators, credit card compa-
nies and other private loan agencies.
This is an attention-worthy sub-
ject because a student loan crisis
similar to the subprime mortgage
crisis of 2008 is looming on the
horizon, and the federal and state
governments must take actions to
avoid it.
Student loans, much like home
loans, are securitized and pack-
aged into asset-backed securities.
These securities, called student loan
asset-backed securities, are then
sold to investors on Wall Street, who
become the end-collectors of your
interest and principle.
Imagine this: Your friend Bob
lends you $10 with $2 interest, then
sells that loan to his friend Mary,
who would receive $11 from you.
Bob, the middleman (or the loan
originator), collects his commission
of $1 through originating the loan to
you and securitizing and selling the

loan to Mary. Bob walks away with
his risk-free commission of $1. Mary
walks away with her investment and
your interest minus Bob's commis-
sion, totaling $11. And you walk away
with a loan deal to pay off school.
Everyone wins, right? Wrong.
There is a chance that you could
default on your student loan. In
the subprime mortgage crisis,
homeowners defaulted on their
mortgages, and the owners of mort-
gage-backed securities ceased to
receive their payments. The MBS
owners - including major invest-
ment banks and hedge funds -
failed too. Finally, mortgage lenders
became insolvent when the demand
for MBS dropped to nearly zero and
more homeowners were forced to
default on their loans. The entire
financial system spun out of control
at that moment.
Three years after the most tragic
recession our country has faced
since the Great Depression, the $1
trillion in outstanding student loans
in the U.S. face an unprecedented
default rate. This time, the stakes are
even greater.
Students who fail to make their
loan payments - interest or prin-
ciple - face many direct conse-
quences. The government has the
right to offset the defaulted loans
by cutting tax refunds, paychecks
and even federal benefits such as
Social Security, retirement or dis-
ability benefits. Public and private
loan originators can file suit to
collect the uncollected portions
of defaulted loans. Unlike home
mortgages, defaulted student loans
generate an indefinite period dur-
ing which originators have the
right to bring suits against insol-
vent individuals until the loans are
fully recovered. Affected individu-
als also suffer from indirect conse-
quences, including the lowering of
credit ratings and greater difficulty
obtaining loans for homes, cars and
businesses.
For our economy, a rise in the
student loan default rate would, in

the short run, reduce dispensable
income, depress the housing mar-
ket and cause private originators of
student loans to raise interest rates
to reflect the elevated risk. The last
act of adjusting rates on newly issued
loans would further diminish stu-
dents' abilities to pay back interest
and loans, elevating the student loan
default rate even higher.
If they default,
other markets
will suffer.
Higher tuition and higher rates
on student loans mean fewer people
can afford a good education. If our
governments choose to ignore this
issue, a stagnant education system
will rid our country of productivity
and innovation in the long run. With
more than $1 trillion outstanding
student loans in the U.S., the impact
of a fallen SLABS market would
affect every other credit market.
The future of the country is at
stake, and the political parties must
be united to oppose this ominous
threat to the well being of our econ-
omy. We need more federal grants
and subsidized loans for students to
tap into, a simpler loan application
process to encourage low-income
households to apply and more pro-
grams to help distressed households
that suffer from the consequences
of student loan default.
The U.S. may be coming out of
one recession, but the rest of the
world is still struggling. We should
not take pride in our meager prog-
ress. Instead, we must set our
objectives for the long run. Educa-
tion is not merely one of the most
important issues - it's the most
important issue of all.

ADDRESS
From Page 1A
2011, adding that the private sec-
tor created 80,000 jobs last year,
spurring applause from legisla-
tors on both sides of the aisle.
Snyder praised Detroit Three
automakers, claiming they re-
established Detroit as the world's
automobile center since Gen-
eral Motors and Chrysler Group
received government bailouts in
2009.
"The automotive industry has
made a major comeback," Sny-
der said. "Last week, I was at the
North American (International)
Auto Show, and I was proud to
say Detroit is still the undisputed
auto capital of the world."
The governor said gains by
the auto industry prove that the
state's economy is on the rise.
"We're rebuilding Michigan's

image as a great place to do busi-
ness," he said. "We're delivering
on substance now, so it's time to
spread the message."
Snyder subsequently
announced trips to Europe and
Asia this year to bring increased
global business initiatives to the
state.
Still, Snyder cautioned that
the state is lacking in a few key
indicators on his "Michigan
Dashboard" - an index he cre-
ated of the state's performance
in areas such as public safety and
health.
He also touched on education,
noting that while the state has
improved, it is "unacceptable"
that Michigan students proved
to be only 1 percent more college-
ready than they were last year.
"Our children are our future,
and we need to make sure that
they are not just college-ready
but career-ready," he said.

Snyder also announced two
major statewide initiatives dur-
ing his speech. The first, Pure
Michigan Fit, a partnership
between Gerber baby food, the
Michigan Grocers Association
and the Michigan Health and
Hospital Association, aims to
curb childhood obesity.
The second initiative, he said,
is a revamped public transit
system for southeast Michigan
currently in its planning stages.
The city of Detroit, four sur-
rounding countries and the U.S.
Department of Transportation
are participating in the planning
process for a new light rail sys-
tem. He said lack of an efficient
transit system in the region has
been a "persistent problem" and
is "40 years overdue."
Snyder also used his speech
to speak more broadly on last
year's political shortcomings.
He highlighted the State Sen-

ate's failure to pass a proposal to
build a bridge from Michigan to
Canada.
"It's not a bridge issue, it's a
jobs issue," Snyder said. "Let's
not let special interests hold
back a great opportunity for job
creation, especially since this
project can be done without any
Michigan taxpayer dollars."
Despite the progress he's wit-
nessed in the state over the past
year, Snyder said Michigan's
attitude is still not optimis-
tic enough and that it needs a
change of culture.
"Simply put, we must rein-
vent our culture," Snyder said.
"We are still too negative, too
divisive, and too many believe
the best days are behind us. We
need to be positive, inclusive and
confident that Michigan holds a
bright future for our children
and their children."
In an interview after the

speech, state Rep. Mark Ouimet
(R-Scio Township) said Snyder's
speech addressed the issues that
state leaders and citizens should
anticipate this year.
Ouimet pointed in particu-
lar to the growth of the state's
budget surplus and the south-
east Michigan rail system as
two important elements of the
address.
"We all understand, to have
a strong Detroit metropolitan
area, you've got to have mass
transit," Ouimet said.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said he was "disappoint-
ed" by the address, calling Sny-
der's assessments "babble."
Irwin said though the gover-
nor appeared to show concern
about the future of education
in the state, Snyder's actions -
referring to cuts to the state's
education appropriations - have
proven otherwise.

"Out of one side of his mouth,
he's saying, 'We need to do bet-
ter with our schools, and I don't
know why my dashboard is say-
ing that our schools are fail-
ing but we need to reverse this
trend,"' Irwin said. "And then
with his hands, he's signing bud-
gets that eviscerate the educa-
tion budget and he is wondering
why we're failing."
Cynthia Wilbanks, the Uni-
versity's vice president for
government relations, said in
a statement that she would be
examining next year's budget
for higher education appropria-
tions carefully, which Snyder is
expected to unveil in early Feb-
ruary.
"At the University of Michi-
gan we'll be looking forward to
more specific proposals for high-
er education, which will likely
come in the governor's budget
message," Wilbanks said.


AUTO SHOW

helps the companies, it helps
the students that work with the
companies, so it's a win-win rela-
tionship."
Hausman said that the solar
car exhibit draws a variety of
' people each year, ranging from
curious onlookers to industry
executives eager to investigate
the up and coming technology.
"Everybody wants to know
or likes to see where the auto
industry is heading, like the new
technologies incorporated into
our vehicle," Hausman said, add-
ing that corporate sponsors also
appreciate the chance to have
their brands displayed on the car
at the exhibit.
Sakti3, a company founded by
Enginnering Prof. Ann Marie
Sastry, is also present at the show,
showcasing its advanced bat-
tery technology. Sastry wrote in
an email that her company was
primarily involved with GM in
designing the next generation of
batteries.
"We partnered early with the
automakers - well before bat-
teries were really a part of the
conversation at the Auto Show,"
Sastry wrote. "Now, it's becom-
ing clear that there is a potential
to avoid execution of two infra-
structures - one for grid power,
and a liquid fuel (gasoline) infra-
structure for transportation - if
we can improve energy density in
batteries."
Edward Krause, external alli-
GSRA
From Page 1A
"I don't think the union would
have stood for it," Dibbern said.
"I think my story again is just a
really clear reason why we need
a union as (GS)RAs."
Dibbern said she has "tried
and exhausted all options" to
resolve this issue with the Uni-
versity.
"I have spoken with my advis-
er, with my department, the Col-
lege of Engineering, Rackham
* graduate school, with academic
human resources," Dibbern
said. "Not one of these avenues
has been helpful."
Dibbern was pursuing a doc-
torate degree in materials sci-
ence and engineering, but can
no longer pursue a degree in the
department. She said she is now
taking classes that are unrelated
W to her former program.
University Spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said in a statement
yesterday that ultimately, the
University was correct in dis-
missing Dibbern.
"The University does not con-
done threats or intimidation of,
or retaliation against, graduate
students for union activity or any
other reason," Fitzgerald wrote.
"The University has reviewed
this matter and believes that our
faculty made appropriate aca-
demic decisions."
In an interview after the
press conference, Fitzgerald said
* the termination is an academic
issue, and therefore, under fed-

ances manager at Ford, said the
automaker's partnerships with
the University have yielded valu-
able information for the company
over the years. He said while Ford
has a long history with the Uni-
versity - including donating the
land that now houses the Uni-
versity's Dearborn campus - the
relationship was officially for-
malized in May 2006.
Since 2006, Krause said the
University has helped the com-
pany in a variety of ways, from
testingtires to creating new algo-
rithms for fuel efficiency and roll
stability control. He added that
Ford has also partnered with
non-engineering departments
at the University, like the School
of Natural Resources and Envi-
ronment to determine how Ford
could enter the developing mar-
ket of "megacities" like Shanghai
or Mumbai, where streets are
over-congested and automobile
transportation isn't effective.
Ford has also worked with the
Ross School of Business to deter-
mine the market conditions in
which consumers will be more
willingto purchase smaller, more
fuel-efficient cars.
Ford's interactive interface,
SYNC, which allows drivers to
dial a cell phone by voice acti-
vation, was partially derived
from safety data collected by
the University's Transporta-
tion Research Institute, Krause
added.
"There was a lot of concern
initially that any involvement on
the phone was a big distraction,"
Krause said. "The distraction
eral law, its specific details can-
not be discussed.
Montgomery said she was dis-
appointed by the way the Uni-
versity handled the incident.
"(Dibbern's firing is) an
injustice so vile that it remains
unparalleled in our 40-year-long
history," Montgomery said. "The
way she has been treated by her
supervisor and the administra-
tion of this university is insult-
ing to the very core of GEO and
to the rights of workers every-
where ... that's not right."
Montgomery added that Dib-
bern's firing is not an isolated
incident, and has occurred vari-
ous times in the past.
"There have been countless
cases of intimidation, including
closed-door meetings with grad-
uate student research assistants,
veiled threats from faculty and
an increasingly hostile work-
place for union activists," Mont-
gomery said.
Montgomery said the GEO,
in its talks with University offi-
cials, presented a list of require-
ments for the University to adopt
in response to this incident,
including "financial and aca-
demic security (for Dibbern),
formal apology and also the
guarantee that this would never
happen again"
While addressing the crowd,
Moore, a GSRA in electrical
engineering and computer sci-
ence, said Dibbern's future has
been threatened by the action
taken by her professor.
"(She) devoted years to build-
ing a foundation of a career

is not talking. It's looking away
from the road and trying to punch
the tiny buttons on the telephone
(the University's) independent
data showed that."
Krause added that the infor-
mation collected by the Univer-
sity helped justify the need for
hands-free dialing and phone use
to be included in the SYNC sys-
tem, which is available in many
of the cars on display at the show.
Ed Borbely, director of the
University's Center for Profes-
sional Development and a former
representative of the University
at NAIAS, said the University's
partnerships with the major
automakers vary, but cited GM
and Ford as the strongest, as the
University's partnership with
Chrysler focuses on post-gradu-
ate education for its employees.
"One thing is very clear ... we
are proud of the role that we've
played in helping the automotive
industry through some tough
times," Borbely said.
John DeCicco, a professor of
natural resources and environ-
ment, said the work being done
at the University was very basic
and not geared toward producing
a specific product. However, he
said that the University's initia-
tives are fundamental in the cre-
ation of future technologies.
"A lot of the work done here
provides a foundation that gets
picked up and developed in a
product engineering sense by
car companies and suppliers,"
DeCicco said. "The University is
the beginning of the innovation
pipeline."
which is nowinjeopardybecause
she was subject to the whims of a
single supervisor, unaccountable
to any fair procedures of work
evaluation," Moore said.
In a public statement, Stu-
dents Against GSRA Unioniza-
tion President Stephen Raiman
said that despite his group's
views, students should be free
to support unionization without
fear of retaliation.
"While we believe that union-
ization is wrong for GSRAs, no
student should face academic
consequences for holding the
opposite view," Raiman wrote.
Raiman added, however, that
this incident should not be used
to bolster the argument for
unionization.
"We believe that exploiting
this unfortunate event for pub-
licity is not in the best interests
of either party," Raiman wrote.
Several local organizations
and unions attended in support
of GEO and the ability of GSRA's
to unionize. Matt Schroeder,
president of the Firefighters'
Union IAFF Local 693, said he
came to support the GEO in its
mission to allow GSRA the right
to form a union.
"They're fellow union mem-
bers," Schroder said. "They cer-
tainly have the right to organize
and, in our opinion, we would
want to see that."
The Michigan Employment
Relations Commission will
hold a hearing next month to
determine if GSRAs are public
employees, which would allow
them the right to unionize.

EXPO
From Page 1A
University.
"We've actually got a number
of interns that are still students
that we've hired in the past, so
we have people represent us that
have been through our summer
internship programs." Burke said.
"We know it's been effective."
LSA senior Allison Kapsner
said she attended the expo in
hopes of speaking to companies
in public policy areas, specifically
ICF International, Capital One
and Cigna.
"I think it's a good way to find
new interest areas and apply to
places that I maybe wouldn't have

considered before," Kapsner said.
Kapsner added that ideally, she
would like to work as a political
consultant in Washington, D.C.
"The career expo can provide
the resources for me to find dif-
ferent jobs that fit that wish list,"
Kapsner said.
Ross Macherzak, an LSA junior
who attended his second Univer-
sity career expo yesterday, said
the expo is a great resource for
networking for students.
"I think it's a great way to get
your name out there (and) expe-
rience what the recruiters are
looking for and real-world experi-
ence." Macherzak said. "And it's
a great way to look for an intern-
ship, too."
Rackham student Shuo Li,

who said she has obtained several
interviews through career expos
in the past, said the career fairs
provide students with resources
and opportunities to speak with
recruiters from around the nation
and learn more about available
positions.
Li said she connected with six
companies during the expo, add-
ing that attending the events in
the past helped her learn how to
identify with the recruiters.
"(After) participating in sev-
eral career fairs, I feel that I have
already accumulated some expe-
rience," Li said. "For example, I
went to talk with the -recruiters
and I saw how to connect with
them quickly and review reports
and show my advantages."

By SYDNEY BERGER

The space formerly occupied
by Poshh on East Liberty Street is
transitioning from chic clothes to
frozen treats with the upcoming
opening of a new self-serve fro-
zen yogurt shop.
Yoggie's, which is scheduled
to open in April, will sell "frozen
health treats" and feature sugar-
free and low-carb frozen yogurt
and toppings including fresh
fruit, candies and homemade
waffle cups, according to owner
Kevin Kajy. With a central loca-
tion on campus, Kajy said he's
hopeful about the future of the
shop.
"Soft serve is always better
than regular ice cream," Kajy
said.

State Street - all establishments
that also sell frozen yogurt and
ice cream products. Despite the
competition, Kajy said Yoggie's
will offer 12 flavors and about 60
toppings, as opposed to Amer's
six frozen yogurt flavors and
about 50 toppings.
He added the store will alter-
nate flavors daily based on cus-
tomer preferences.
"We are looking at over 130
different flavors that you can
have," Kajy said.
Kajy said pricing at Yoggie's
will be done by the ounce and
will likely be 49 cents per ounce
- the same price as Amer's. Hav-
ing signed the lease for the space
two weeks ago, Kajy said he's
still figuring out how to arrange
the shop, but hopes itwill ideally
seat at least 24 people.
"What I would like to do is
put a table-top by the window
that will seat about 10, and then

Kajy said he plans to continue to
spread the word about the shop
throughout the community and
encourage students to come visit.
"We are excited to be in town
and hope everyone enjoys it,"
Kajy said.
Bryan Castillo, assistant
manager at Amer's on Church
Street, said he doesn't anticipate
that Amer's will be negatively
impacted by the new business,
due to their strong customer
base.
"We have a pretty loyal fol-
lowing," he said.
LSA senior Olivia Chitkara
said even though Yoggie's will
offer a wider array of flavors and
toppings, she will still choose to
go to Amer's instead.
"Everywhere I go there is
always an Amer's - Union,
(Church) and State Street," Chit-
kara said. "I always use one top-
ping and the same flavor."

TEACHERS
From Page 1A
of Education associate dean for
academic affairs, with a recorded
message from U.S. Secretary of
Education Arne Duncan, accord-
ing to the program's website.
Ball said the School of Educa-
tion has significantly changed
its method of training students
over the past several years. The
school is now concerned with the
importance of interacting with
children and understanding how
they think and learn, rather than
focusing primarily on the mate-
rial they will be taught.
"Based on the changes that are
ongoing at Michigan, the Universi-
ty of Michigan is trying to change
the way that teachers are trained
in other states and other univer-
sities," Ball said. "They can learn
from what is happening here."
She added that a primary goal
of TeachingWorks is to provide
increased access to materials such
as videos and workshops that will
enable teachers to become better
instructors.
Francesca Forzani, associate
director of TeachingWorks, said

the program will attempt to cul-
tivate these skills in individuals
who are training to become teach-
ers by designing new materials for
them to study.
Forzani said many of the edu-
cational materials are videos
that will soon be posted on the
TeachingWorks website and
will feature examples of teach-
ers exhibiting particular tactics
within the classroom, like leading
strong class discussions.
The program also offers work-
shops on teaching to individuals
who trainteachers, some of which
already took place last summer.
Forzani said the training Teach-
ingWorks provides to people who
educate teachers is one reason
why the program is so unique.
"There are a ton of programs
for learning to teach in this coun-
try, but there are very few orga-
nizations out there that actually
offer resources and training to the
people who teach teachers," she
said. "I think something really
distinctive about us is that we do
offer these programs for people
who educate teachers."
Forzani added that there has
long been uncertainty within
the field of teaching about which

practices are most effective and
necessary for teachers to learn.
The program strives to alleviate
some of this uncertainty by unit-
ing groups of people to decide
upon and promote the most
important teaching skills, she
said.
"It is really amazing that the
fieldhasnot come together tohave
this conversation in an organized
manner in the past," Forzani said.
"I think that bringing that agenda
to the table and designing new
things around that will be a huge
contribution."
Education prof. Bob Bain
wrote in an e-mail interview
that he believes TeachingWorks
will become a powerful tool for
improving teaching in the United
States.
"TeachingWorks will take up
very important questions, and
will convene some of the best and
most experienced people to work
on these questions," he wrote. "I
suspect that TeachingWorks will
soon be among the first places
people come to when tackling the
serious issues entailed in improv-
ing teaching and learning from
pre-school through doctoral and
professional schools."

Republican candidates try
to derail Romney campaign

More than 75
companies come to
recruit students
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Mitt
Romney's Republican rivals are
intensifying their efforts to
erode if not eliminate his stand-
ing as the man most likely to
defeat President Barack Obama
this fall, often stressing their
own prospects over his in the
final few days before South
Carolina's potentially decisive
weekend primary.
The stepped-up challenge to
Romney's electability, in paid
television advertising, cam-
paign appearances and the first
of two pre-primary debates,
appears aimed at one of his
principal strengths in the Iowa

caucuses and New Hampshire
primaries. Voters in both con-
tests said they prized a can-
didate's ability to beat Obama
over a candidate's conservative
credentials, a preference that
helped the former Massachu-
setts governor to his pair of vic-
tories.
After spending days chal-
lenging Romney's record as a
businessman, Newt Gingrich
unveiled a television commer-
cial on Tuesday that starts
with an announcer saying only
the former House speaker can
defeat Obama.
The ad makes no inention of
Romney, instead showing Gin-
grich drawing cheers from the
audience at Monday's debate
in Myrtle Beach when he said,
"More people have been put on
food stamps by Barack Obama

than any president American
history."
Gingrich also drew sustained
applause from businessmen
and businesswomen after a
speech late Tuesday that made
only passing reference to Rom-
ney, and none at all to his other
rivals. Instead, he outlined his
own proposals for lower taxes,
less regulation and expanded
domestic energy production.
"I believe I am the only can-
didate in this race who under-
stands the scale of change
necessary to get this country
working again," Gingrich said.
He predicted that if he wins the
state's primary, the nomination
would follow, adding, "We will
run a campaign of paychecks vs.
food stamps and we will beat
Obama virtually everywhere in
this country."

Michigan looks to
prove itself on road

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
Michigan coach Red Berenson tried out for the Michigan baseball team during his time in Ann Arbor. The catcher position was filled, instead, by Bill Freehan.
Red Berenson and baseball

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
The question is floated by a
Cleveland Indians representa-
tive.
He wants to know if any
Michigan hockey players have
any baseball experience - some-
thing that wouldn't be relevant
if the Wolverines hadn't just fin-
ished an outdoor hockey game
on ice that stretched from home
plate to shallow right field.
Seniors Greg Pateryn and
David Wohlberg give cour-
tesy chuckles, but refer back
to the glory days of T-ball for
their baseball experience. Then
Michigan coach Red Berenson,
the 72-year-old hockey legend,
throws out a story that is truly
from left field.
After Berenson's freshman
year of hockey at Michigan, he
and two other teammates want-
ed to try out for the baseball
team. How in the world Beren-
son learned how to play baseball
in the 1950s while growing up
in Regina, Saskatchewan isn't
exactly clear, but apparently the
man could hold his own on the
diamond.
His leg strength from hockey
made him a perfect candidate to
play catcher, which is what he
intended to do after hockey sea-
son in Ann Arbor.
The baseball team used to
practice in Yost - back when it
was the Field House - so before

lacrosse and hockey have, it's
not surprising that Pateryn still
values the lessons he learned in
high school.
"It was a good way to stay in
shape in the off-season, and you
actually pick up some stuff about
hockey, I thought," Pateryn said.
"You always had to keep your
head up because you couldn't be
looking at your stick, so it helped
with that aspect."
The last Wolverine hockey
player to play two sports at
Michigan was Matt Herr, who
was a captain on the 1997-98
squad and also played baseball.
Herr was drafted in both sports,
which is the big reason Beren-
son allowed him to do both. He
ended up playing for parts of
four seasons in the NHL.
But he was the last Wolver-
ine to do it, 14 years ago, and the
throwback story Berenson tells
is one that won't be repeated
anytime soon.
Back at the press conference,
Pateryn and Wohlberg chuckle
about Berenson's story.
They don't chuckle because
they don't believe Berenson -
they chuckle because they do
believe him.
"I think we laughed because
we weren't really surprised that
he said something like that,"
Pateryn said. "Anything that
comes out of his mouth ... you
couldn't be surprised at all. I
could never see him playing
baseball - especially in Cana-
da - but he just never ceases to
amaze us with the stuff he says."

All season, Michigan women's
basketball coach Kevin Borseth
has preached the importance
of defense.

rebounding or Michigan at
blocking out, N'Western

Wolverines Where: Welsh-
take on North- Ryan Arena
western at TV/Radio:
Welsh-Ryan MGoBlue.com
Arena in Evan-
ston on Thurs-
day, they will be facing a team
that, according to Wildcats coach
Joe McKeown, centers its defense
around stopping the opposing
teams' top-two scorers every
game.
Focal point or not, the good
news for Michigan is that it has
done a tremendous job offen-
sively of spreading the ball out
among different players this sea-
son. The Wolverines have five
players who average more than
seven points per game as well as
a slew of bench players that also
contribute.
"On any given night, we have
Kate (Thompson) coming off the
bench who scores in double dig-
its, and we have Rachel (Sheffer)
who's a scorer from both inside
and out," said junior guard Jenny
Ryan. "Ifyoujust go down the list,
I don't know if they can key in on
(one player)."
Thompson, a junior forward,
averages 9.8 points per game, and
Sheffer, also a junior forward, is
scoring 13 points per game. The
Wolverines leading scorer, senior
guard Courtney Boylan, averages
13.1 points per game. The floor
general has been the consistent
leader for Michigan, playing 33.2
minutes per game - second only
to Ryan, who averages about a
minute more.
Though Michigan seems to be
in good shape offensively, it has
a difficult task ahead defensively.
Northwestern boasts two of the
best post players in the Big Ten -
junior center Dannielle Diamant
and junior forward KendallHack-
ney. Those two average a com-
bined 31 points and 11 rebounds
per game for the Wildcats.
As the Wolverines' starting
post player, Sheffer will have
the task of guarding this height.
However, she doesn't see it as her
versus them down low.
"Just like any other team, most
BigTen teams have a biggirl down

low," Sheffer said. "We just need
to come together on the defensive
end of the court. We front the post
so it's more of us coming together
than me doing all the work."
Michigan plays both man
defense and zone defense, but
either way, it takes a strong help
defense to stop opposing post
players. This is also because the
Wolverines, lacking a true center,
featurea guard-oriented offense.
Whether it's rebounding or the
imminent battle down low, Mich-
igan will have one other struggle
against Northwestern: playing on
the road. The Wolverines are 8-0
in the trappings of Ann Arbor this
season, but just 4-4 on the road.
Though the Wildcats may not
be a typical Big Ten powerhouse,
Welsh-Ryan Arena can still pose
problems for an away team, evi-
denced by Northwestern's 5-3
home record.
"Northwestern is definitely a
"(Evanston)
is definitely a
different place
to play."
different place to play," Ryan said.
"It's kind of more of an old-school
environment. And just like any
time on the road, you have to cre-
ate energy for yourselves and stay
confident in what you do, and for
better or for worse just stay con-
sistent."
However, Borseth plays down
the effects of road environment
on his team.
"All I think about is the x's
and o's, and the jimmy's and
joes," he said. "More so (at least),
than home court (and) away
stuff."
Even if the Wolverine faith-
ful don't make their way out to
Evanston, one Michigan player
at least will have a cheering sec-
tion on Thursday. Junior forward
Sam Arnold, a native of Medinah,
Ill. said she has "a lot of family
and friends coming, (and) it will
be fun." Medinah is only 45 min-
utes away from Evanston, which
should provide for a nice trip for
the Arnold crew.
The game on Thursday against
Northwestern will be important
for the Wolverines' confidence as
their conference schedule gains
momentum. Considering Michi-
gan's most impressive road win
came on Nov.11 against Florida, it
needs to prove it can win against
formidable foes on the road.

With as much crossover as

Hardaway Jr's emotional sobriety

n a 2009 interview with
Sporting News, Ron Artest
made a stunning revelation
that he had a troubling halftime
habit.
"I used to
drink Hen-
nessy ... at
halftime. I
(kept it) in my
locker. I'd just
walk to the i_
liquor store DANIEL
and get it." WASSERMAN
In Ann
Arbor, anoth-
er star has a troubling habit -
sophomore guard Tim Hardaway
Jr. has a tendency to be drunk on
his own emotions before sobering
up at halftime.
Hardaway's half-to-half
change in production has been
well-documented, especially in
big games. None was more nota-
ble than last year, when Michigan
State visited Michigan in the
regular-season finale.
Hardaway was held scoreless
in the first half, as the Spartans
took momentum into halftime
despite trailing. But the Miami
native played perhaps his best
half in a Wolverine uniform,
scoring 20 second-half points to
lead Michigan to a victory - and
a season sweep - over Michigan
State.
His sometimes-inconsistent
play last year can be written off

as freshman struggles, but this
year's struggles are more con-
cerning. Though his point totals
this year are up from last year, his
shooting struggles over the past
month have been, as Charles Bar-
kley would say, "turrible."
In the nine games Michi-
gan has played since a Dec.17
matchup with Alabama A&M,
Hardaway has connected on just
11-of-59 3-pointers, an abomi-
nable 18.6 percent. Frequently,
Hardaway has spent first halves
chucking up out-of-rhythm deep
bombs before being reminded
at halftime to settle down, play
within the offense and attack
the basket, where he can often
score at will. Despite inconsistent
first halves, Hardaway has used
second-half scoring to keep his
point-per-game average above 15.
But despite his own mental
struggles, Hardaway was confi-
dent when asked Monday what he
would tell freshman point guard
Trey Burke in preparation for
Michigan State.
"Just the same advice that I've
been giving to him before every
Big Ten game," Hardaway said.
"This game is going to be bigger
than probably any other game
we've played all season, just
because it's an in-state rivalry
and everyone knows each other
pretty well.
"Just go out there and have
fun and try not to get emotionally

drunk."
But when Tuesday's first half
rolled around, it was Burke who
looked like the veteran everyone
expected Hardaway to be, while
Hardaway was the one who
looked like he was playing under
the influence of the big stage.
While Burke almost single-
handedly gave Michigan a seven-
point halftime lead, Hardaway
was held to just four points and
without a field goal.
At halftime, Artest would turn
to liquor to get his head straight.
Hardaway sought a much sim-
pler option: his teammates and
coaches.
"My teammates did a great job
at halftime," Hardaway said. "(At)
halftime, (senior guards) Corey
Person, Zack Novak, Stu Doug-
lass, they all came up to me and
said, 'That's why it's two halves,'
and, 'You've just got to keep
your head up and turn it around
because it's a long game still.'
"Coach Beilein also (talked) to
me, telling me to, 'Keep (on) a yes
face.'"
So in the opening minute of the
second stanza, Hardaway found
himself with the ball in transition
on a one-on-one. He did what he
does best, soaring to the basket,
clutching in midair before ham-
mering down a one-handed slam.
Within the next several
sequences, he made his presence
felt on defense, drawing two

offensive charges in the paint,
where Michigan State otherwise
seemed to have its way.
Michigan found itself trailing
by three points at the final official
timeout of the game with less
than four minutes remaining, and
the Wolverines would get the ball
out of the break.
The play was drawn up for
Hardaway to get a shot. The
same Hardaway who was shoot-
ing 1-for-7 in the game and who
hadn't scored a point in almost 16
minutes.
Naturally, like he's done in so
many late-game spots, he drilled
it. Moments later, after two Spar-
tan free throws, Hardaway drove
along the baseline and scored on a
layup in traffic.
And just minutes later, Hard-
away and his teammates were
dancing at midcourt.
Hardaway hasn't lived up to
the player he was expected to
be this year. Preseason worriers
that said he might go pro after
the season have gone silent. He's
not even Michigan's best player
anymore.
Hardaway's game - his first
half - need a lot of work. But
even if his emotions still get the
best of him early on, Hardaway
doesn't need any liquid courage to
turn his veins to ice late in games.

Strange Mercy - St. Vincent
Despite the fact that it entirely evaded a review
by The Michigan Daily last year, St. Vincent's
Strange Mercy is arguably one of the best albums of
2011. Maybe we missed it because no combination
of words can do the album justice. Give it a listen
and you'll find yourself smitten - there's a reason
her website is called Ilovestvincent.com.
uROUP
"Nashville"
"Nashville" is the classic no one watches. It's a
lonely country growl desperately wanting to be
heard. It's a testament to the '70s, filmmaking's
most audacious and compelling decade. It's the
Altamont of country. It's a film that emotionally
wreaks us hours after we've watched it. It's stares
across crowded bars, songs drowned out by rac-
ing cars, words that lovers say to un-lovers, people
bumping into each other and barely feeling a thing.
"The Satanic Verses"
Salman Rushdie
"The Satanic Verses" is Salman Rushdie's most
controversial work, sparking a furious debate over
the limits of what literature should allow and things
that offend people. Christopher Hitchens saw the out-
cry and understood instantly what it implied for the
future of our society. Read this book now as a remind-
er of what Hitchens fought for through his life: free-
dom of speech and its direct relative, the freedom to
offend.
"Lost Girl"
Hailing from Canada, "Lost Girl" has found a
home on Syfy. The series premiered in the U.S. this
past Monday. Michelle Lovretta's ("Sorority Wars")
creation follows the succubus Bo and her encoun-
ters with magical creatures like werewolves, shape-
shifters and male sirens. The show seeks to quench
the thirst of TV watchers' supernatural affixations,
and you should watch it simply for your weekly dose
of, "I'm sorry, what just happened?"

Which comics have the greatest villains?
The greatest villains, I would say, can be found in Batman.
How do you feel about comic books made into movies?
Done well, (they) can be phenomenal. But done poorly, you end up
with something like 'The Walking Dead' on AMC, which should be

What does a comic book have to offer its readers?
A comic book has to offer nothing different than a good novel

A new era of
alternative eats

Diving into comic books

W hen we think of
things that are
trending, our brains
bounce to TOMS, "Words With
Friends" and maybe even Ricky
Gervais, but
we bypass
society's
constantly
altering pre-
occupation
with special
foods (quinoa
and coconut JULIA
oil come to SMITH-
mind). @hip- EppSTEINERE
stermermaid
tweeted it
just right, further pinning him-
self down as a comedic and self-
loathing liberal: "I accidentally
ate some quinoa while listening
to NPR and now I drive a Prius."
The point here is not to make
fun of people who make quinoa
instead of rice and use soy bever-
ages instead of milk - I cooked
a quinoa dinner just the other
night. I was pretty damn proud
and delighted with the product,
and I no longer consume dairy
without a lactate pill. The idea
is to simply call attention to the
food quirks of today.
Lactose intolerance, gluten
intolerance, veganism, vegetari-
anism and pescetarianism: five-
too-many reasons to stay away
from a delicious cheeseburger,
bun included? And for what
reason? Well, I'm learningthat,
actually, there are many valid
and convincing reasons to stay
away from that mouth-watering
item (not that I have totally got-
ten to that place yet).
Let's begin with the cheese
"topping" that seems truly
essential while devouring. Sad
news: Humans would likely
benefit from ceasing to consume
dairy after the breastfeeding
period, as 75-percent of the
world's population is estimated
to be lactose-deficient. Accord-
ing to Medline Plus, approxi-
mately 30 million Americans
have some variant amount of
lactose intolerance by age 20.
It's possible to not realize that
you're a malabsorber of lactose
until later in life. As a malab-
sorber, you can train your body
to be tolerant of dairy, so that
while you may not be having the
typical gassy symptoms, you also
won't be absorbing the nutrients
that are positively connected to
dairy products. It's when you
decrease your intake of dairy
and then go back to it that you
may realize you're an intolerant
malabsorber who should start
purchasing non-dairy cream
cheese and taking Lactaid Fast
Act pills with irresistible items
like Annie's Mac & Cheese.
Next is the meat of the meal,
the meat. Our bodies don't need
the protein from meat nearly
as much as Americans think.
There's an expansive list of
reasons for not eating meat,
including global citizenship that
encompasses environmental
friendliness, the idea that ani-
mals are equal to humans and a

strong distaste for the cruel and
unnatural conduct of the food
industry.
My sister's explanation was
simple, but keeps her away from
all meats that are neither free-
range nor fish: "I will eat organ-
ic, free-range white meat that
doesn't have antibiotics or hor-
mones. I've learned about what
the food industry is like and how
the animals are raised and kept,
and it grosses me out that I con-
sume that. It's really just that I'll
eat clean, healthy meat, but it's
not that readily available in my
(college) life."
A phrase that would be typi-
cal among vegetarians who are
comfortable with bending the
rules a bit is something like,
"Don't worry, the animal only
had one bad day," meaning it was
a healthy animal that avoided
abuse. That might do the trick
for some, but for others, the con-
sumption of the animal in this
scenario is just as offensive and
unjust as the meat of the food
industry at large.
That tofurkey
isn't as
pretentious as
you may think.
We all know one thing more
about life in the context of food
- girls (and guys) just want to
have (a peek at) bun(s) - except
for those with gluten intoler-
ance. I know some people that
discovered it through hereditary
concerns, and others via think-
ing it was IBS, and then pro-
ceeded to keep a food diary and
edit foods out of their diet until
discovering what made them feel
well. I've even read that there
are a number of celebrities who
have removed gluten from their
diet to get skinny and healthy.
Stars as loved as Zooey Descha-
nel and Victoria Beckham (Posh,
if you prefer) have converted to
the gluten-free way, with most
of them describing it as invigo-
rating and a nudge toward that
unrealistic size zero.
People making trendy food
choices derived from physiologi-
cal intolerances or disagree-
ments with the healthiness of
certain edible items are easy to
poke fun at for eating "hipster"
meals - tempeh burger and rice
milk, possibly - but it's not an
uprising of non-dairy, non-glu-
ten and vegetarian foods without
reason. I'm unsure if I'll ever
say a hard-and-fast goodbye to
an In-N-Out omnivore lifestyle,
but I'm in mighty full support
of others' adherence to dietary
restrictions. Trendy owners of
happier-than-average intestines
and bodies, rejoice!

Peeling back the
many layers of
graphic narratives
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Arts Writer
Most students have at least
skimmed one of Shakespeare's
plays. Of those who have read his
work, some can probably recite a
couple of his legendary lines. But
there's a much greater chance
they know the following main-
stream proverb: "With great
power comes great responsibil-
ity." As Curtis Sullivan, owner
of local comic book store Vault
of Midnight, said, "Everybody's a
geek in some way, and they don't
even know."
Sullivan and others recognize
that comic books have tradition-
ally been seen as a less high-brow
form of art. But critical views of
this medium have changed over
the years. Take "Watchmen" for
example. In 2005, Time magazine
included Alan Moore's magnum
opus on its list of the 100 Best Nov-
els since 1923, when the magazine
was first published. Or what about
the numerous film adaptions of
"Spider-Man" and "Iron Man"?
Comic books have indeed become
a powerful and even ubiquitous
force in the media.
However, the debate contin-
ues concerning their place in
academics and culture. Sullivan
argues that comic books are for
everybody.
"I'm constantly amazed," he
said, discussing the demograph-
ics of his store's fan base. "We
have neurosurgeons who have
been buying comics from us

for 10 years, college professors,
school librarians - it's just all
over the map."
"And I think ... geek culture is
almost mainstream," he added.
"Pretty soon there won't be a
geek culture."
But can a "graphic novel" be
considered a book? To attempt to
settle this question, Eric Rabkin,
a longtime professor who teaches
a course on graphic narrative at
the University, shed some light
on a genre that he has defended
and loved for many years.
"I think that 'Watchmen' is a
different kind - and that's what
the word genre means - a differ-
ent kind of work than a text-only
novel," Rabkin said.
"When people say that
('Watchmen') shouldn't be con-
sidered one of the 100 best books
of the year, or of all time, what
they're really saying is, 'It's not
a book,'" Rabkin said. "The fight
there is about whether or not
a given work can be a part of a
given genre."
Comic books provide a differ-
ent experience from the standard
novel, but their ability to tell a
story shouldn't be considered less
worthy than that of the novel.
Rabkin believes that language is
not what we read in words and
letters, that those are merely a
representation of language. In
his view, language exists in our
social relations, in the things we
do every day with each other.
Therefore, Rabkin thinks it
would be incorrect to think of a
comic book as a book with pic-
tures. That would imply that the
narrative could survive without
its graphic aspect, its language.
But the narrative of comic books
is entirely reliant on their visual

nature, he said. As opposed to
illustrations, which are unnec-
essary to the storytelling, comic
book visuals actually form the
narrative.
"If (the pictures) were missing,
you wouldn't have a story. When
that's the case, this is what you
call visuals," Rabkin said.
Rabkin's students learn that
distinction in his English 418
"Graphic Narrative" class.
"I think that you need to learn
the language of comics," Rabkin
said. "I want my students to be
able to write essay(s) that exploit
the possibilities of having visual
information in the overall argu-
ment that they'd developed."
His students use visuals as an
integral part of their creative sto-
rytelling and their essays as well.
If you can tell it, he thinks that you
might as well show it, too.
Sullivan, too, believes in the
importance of graphic narrative.
He sees potential in the combina-
tion of words and visuals, which
allow the storyteller to do things
that otherwise might be impos-
sible.
"It's not pictures plus words,"
Sullivan said. "It's a new thing.
It's one plus one is three."
But there are those who dis-
agree. Though she doesn't claim
to be an expert in comic books,
LSA sophomore Janet Hu, the
vice presidentofthe Undergradu-
ate English Association, believes
that visuals should not be used in
academic essays.
"I don't necessarily think that
comic book graphics are neces-
sary in a text," she said. "I think
they can help aid, but sometimes,
when it comes to literature, I
think the words should evoke an
image."

Again, the issue of genre arose.
That's not to say Hu thinks com-
ics are unworthy of respect; she
just believes visuals would only
be appropriate for academic
writing in classes like Rabkin's
graphic narrative course. But like
Rabkin and Sullivan, she asserts
that the popularity of comic
books in mainstream culture is
undeniable, and that it's certainly
a worthy medium.
There are numerous inde-
pendent comic books stocked at
Vault of Midnight that originate
in the Ann Arbor area. Sullivan
claimed these independent series
sell often, and he noted that one
locally produced comic in par-
ticular called "Nate the Noncon-
formist," is one of his favorites.
"The artistic community is
generally going full-tilt," Sullivan
said. "We sell five to 10 different
books that are all locally written
or drawn."
Inside Sullivan's store is a tow-
ering collection of comic books,
games and toys: a testament to
the owner's passion for "geek"
culture. And, of course, everyone
is welcome to have a taste.
To some people like Rabkin,
comic books have certainly pen-
etrated our culture and have even
gained prestige in academic cir-
cles. To others like Hu, its place
in culture and academics is less
clear. In a few more years, who
knows where comic books will
be?
"Anybody who's not paying
attention is really going to miss
the boat," Sullivan said. "They'll
be like those people who said
the Internet will never catch on.
Don't fall asleep on a medium
that's been kicking ass for 100
years in America."

'THE WEST WING' (1999), NBC
Puttg est upto the test

Like in the salons of 17th
and 18th century France,
this weekly installment
will feature two Daily Arts
writers discussing the finer
points of arts mediums
from at least 10 years ago.
"The West Wing" is one of the
greatest television shows ever
made, and for my money, it's
probably the single most enter-
taining. When it clicked, it could
do absolutely everything that was
within a TV show's power to do.
Aaron Sorkin writes the hell out
of the dialogue. There are about
eight or nine characters with as
much depth as any other series
lead. The plot makes tax codes
and trade disputes riveting and
the comic interludes are per-
fectly placed. The show wears its
lefty politics on its sleeve, but it's
also pretty good about not being
preachy.
"The West Wing" is also often
a problematic show, no matter
your politics. One thing com-
mon to all of Sorkin's TV work
("Sports Night" being the chief
other example) is that the epi-
sodic structure is often too neat,
so well put together that you
can paradoxically see the seams.

The show will throw three plots
at you, and at some point about
halfway through the episode the
thematic connection becomes
apparent. However subtle it is, it's
never quite subtext. The show
never hits you over the head. "It's
too well put together!" is kind of a
silly quibble, but a television show
reminding you how well it is writ-
ten is, tacitly, also reminding you
that it was, after all, written. And
being reminded once every three
episodes or so that, indeed, you
are watching a television show, is

a little jarring.
It's easy to make fun of every
great work of art, and Sorkin's
style lends itself to mockery par-
ticularly well. It's not really a
problem in the vast majority of
episodes, but "The West Wing's"
distinct visual and dialogic style
makes it obvious when the epi-
sode doesn't have much to say. I
can only think of five or six epi-
sodes during Sorkin's entire ten-
ure that came off as formulaic, but
all the walk-and-talks, the simple
conversations that have about five

minutes' worth of quips and SAT
words flying around the corridors
of power make up a hyperstylistic
tone that makes those episodes
so much more grating. I realize
the criticism really boils down
to "there were like five episodes
that were only pretty good," but
I have high expectations for the
best network show of the decade.
Unfortunately, it's impossible
to talk about "The West Wing"
without at least addressing the
Sorkin-less seasons. Season five

MARTIAL ARTS
From Page 1B
Putting the "self"in
self-defense
Though martial arts are often
imagined in movies as aggressive
systemsof flamboyant swings and
kicks, these fictional movements
usually never exist outside of the
silver screen. A true martial art
invokes balance and composure:
techniques even more difficult to
perfect than a flurry of punches.
"You have to stop yourself,"
Sierant said. "You can't just get
into a frenzy and hit them as
much as you can. You have to hold
yourself back and make sure that
everything's together, or you'll
just get blown apart."
Many groups see utility as a
crucial aspect of self-restraint.
For 'U' clubs such as the Shorin-
Ryu Karate-do Club and the
Godai Ninpo Association, this
utility is key. By focusing on using
realistic actions applied to real-
istic scenarios, these groups give
their practitioners the tools nec-
essary to survive and improvise
in any number of situations.
"We're an extremely practical
art," King said. "If you're doing
real, traditional martial arts,
you're not doing it to be fancy
like you see in the kung-fu flicks,
and you're not doing it with rules,
whichyou see inthings like MMA
(Mixed Martial Arts)."
While karate provides stu-
dents with a range of effective
offensive and defensive moves, it
also instills followers with a situ-
ational awareness that changes
the way they think about their
internal and external world.
"You only want to use as much
force as is necessary to get out of
a situation," King said. "And that
could be just walking away. one of
the things that we teach people is
this humility. You're not out here
to be the big guy or the tough guy."
The University's Godai Ninpo
Club also emphasizes function-
ality over flare. Godai ninpo
pulls techniques from many pre-
existing ninjitsu styles, combin-
ing them into a utilitarian system

TERRA MOLENGRAFF/Daily
Students of karate and other martial arts find their activity's roots in ancient Asian practices, like the use of sai (pictured right), which are modeled after farming tools that had been used in place of weapons.

of self-defense that aims to keep
practitioners safe.
Additionally, godai ninpo uses
an elemental system consisting
of characteristics of earth, water,
fire, wind and void to help prac-
titioners visualize the systems
of thought they must use when
approaching every situation.
"Godai ninpo is all about per-
severance and controlling your
ego to better yourself so that
you survive the situation," said
Andrew Gomes, a former member
of the Godai Ninpo Club.
It's a strict command and a
thorough understanding of these
elements of the self that allow
students to truly progress in their
study of martial arts.
"The most demanding part is
being willing to put aside your
ego in order to learn," Gomes
said. "Because it's such an uncon-
ventional martial art from what
we're used to in Western culture.
We're used to a style of 'stand-up,
square-up' to your opponent to see
who can take the biggest beating."
Godai ninpo focuses entirely on
more practical scenarios its mem-

setting. Though it's inherently
noncompetitive, this form elevates
from a series of defensive strate-
gies into a martial art through its
holistic demand for mental, physi-
cal and emotional discipline.
"It helps shape the way you
view the world," Gomes said. "As
you study godai ninpo you'll gen-
erally strive for a balanced life
that's not convoluted by all the
petty little things that pervade
our culture."
Forms, function and
competition
Not all schools include com-
petition in their repertoires, but
many do feature some form of
one-on-one sparring alongside
their teaching of forms, which
are sequences of techniques per-
formed in a traditional order or
style that students must mas-
ter before advancing to the next
belt. Though the ceremonial air
of forms has a very different feel
than the dynamic atmosphere of a
live match, they are two halves of
a whole - one cannot be learned

Kendo is another martial art
that incorporates a strong com-
petitive element into the fabric of
its practice. While competitions
may provide a sporting atmo-
sphere for their participants,
forms allow them to maintain the
physically artistic aspects of their
studies.
"Every form is one-on-one,"
Sierant said. "You and a partner
going through these pre-scripted,
I would almost call it a dance,
between the two of you. You try
and put as much intensity and
beauty into going through all
of these forms, but they are also
supposed to teach you something
about actually doing kendo in a
competition form."
Still, many students enjoy one-
on-one matches, which allow
them to truly put their physical
and mental discipline to the test.
"Unlike a lot of other martial
arts, where actual competition
and fighting is almost more of an
honorific thing you do ... (kendo)
definitely has a strongcompetition
aspect," Sierant said.
"You're going to hit as hard as
you can and go as fast as you can,
kind of like taekwondo. In tae-
kwondo, competition is a very
important aspect, and kendo
also follows that," he added.
Taekwondo is especially val-
ued as a sport due to its stren-
uous physical demands. Its
extensive use of footwork forces
students of taekwondo to keep
themselves in peak physical and
mental condition.
It is also one of the most
sports-oriented martial arts
practiced at the University and
in the world of martial arts.
Taekwondo is the national
sport of South Korea, where it
was developed and refined from
techniques that were hundreds
of years old.
"Taekwondo is really fast-
paced and involves really
dynamic kicking," said LSA
senior and UM Taekwondo
Club president Sadegh Arab.

"You have to be in great shape,
and you have to be very flexible in
order to be able to do it."
Though students routinely
work on sparring during practic-
es, the frequentcompetitionspro-
vide a highly athletic challenge
to the club's members. While
members are not required to par-
ticipate in competitions, they are
encouraged to do so to enhance
their practices.
"We've seen that people that
compete end up taking practice
more seriously, and they stay
healthier, and they try harder,"
Arab said. "So it's kind of like a
feedback mechanism. That's why
we encourage people to com-
pete."
Taekwondo may be popular
as an athletic activity, but it still
retains strong ties to the tradi-
tions of martial arts.
"Even though most of us in
college are doing it as a sport,
it has the respect and the disci-
pline that comes from being a
martial art. People don't behave
the same way in a taekwondo
practice as in a soccer practice,"
Arab said.
At its core, taekwondo is a
dualistic martial art. Even the
most ardent competitor must
have a thorough knowledge of
the forms that lay the ground-
work for sparring,.which many
see as qualifying as a full-blown
sport. Though not as spontane-
ous as a one-on-one match, the
precise and measured moves of
taekwondo's forms give practi-
tioners a disciplined quality of
elegance.
"It's a performance, you know,
it's like a dance," Arab said. "You
have to memorize a sequence of
techniques, you have to perfect
it and you have to make sure that
every step you take is right."
Mind, body and spirit
Though they may share com-
mon pasts, the countless martial
arts schools, clubs and groups at

the University and around the
globe offer each of their partici
pants different challenges, expe-
riences and rewards.
"(Martial arts) is having to
bring your body and your mind
and all of your thoughts togeth-
er to focus on doing one thing,"
Sierant said. "It's this simulta-
neousness, this coherence, that I
think is certainly one of the most
difficult parts. You have to have
a clarity of coherence between
what's inside and what's outside."
The mental and physical bal-
ance fostered by students does
not leave when a belt is untied
or a uniform is removed. A true
martial artempowers its students
with the skills needed to face life
inside and outside the practice
studio.
"When you leave the basketball
court, the skills you have on court
don't translate into real life or
real-life situations, whereas with
traditional martial arts, those
skills can translateinto real situa-
tions," King said.
These skills are not only use-
ful for situations in which a clear
enemy must be overcome - stu-
dents are able to use what they've
learned to better understand fam-
ily, friends and even themselves.
"(Martial arts have) certainly
helped me in my discipline in
school and with friends, but also
in other circumstances where
maybe I feel like I'm a little over-
whelmed or I'm angry at some-
one," Sierant said. "I'm able to
better control myself after forcing
myself to learn how to do that in
kendo."
Martial arts practitioners are
asked to seek the most difficult
control of all: control of one-
self. But a combination of focus,
dedication and a willingness to
think openly can lead students
of every discipline into a jour-
ney of rewarding self-discovery,
allowing them to become liv-
ing, breathing embodiments of
the arts to which they dedicate
themselves.

WEST WING
From Page 3B
was not very good, and there's
no way around that. Sorkin's
successors betrayed much of
the characterization the show
had spent four seasons building.
The plot points veered toward
the melodramatic. The opposi-
tion was demonized. But credit
the writers for bouncing back in
seasons six and seven. Though
none of them approached Sor-
kin's cleverness or virtuos-
ity (and really, who can write
dialogue like he does?), their
deconstruction of major char-
acters and subversion of the
idealism that was fundamental
to Sorkin's version of the show
was fascinatingto watch, even if
some of season five's weakness-
es occasionally still popped up.
Oh, and also, during Juwan
Howard's cameo, they made
him say he went to Duke. So
screw them.
-SAM CENZHANG
To some, "The West Wing"
is a by-product of left-wing
extremism hijacking Holly-
wood. The show, which depicted
seven years behind the scenes of
a passionate, productive Demo-
cratic White House, was dispar-
aged as an explicit expression of
creator Aaron Sorkin's promi-

nent liberal bias. And it's true that
the Bartlet administration is at
times deeply inspired by the glory
days of the Clinton administra-
tion, though embarrassing hic-
cups like that affair with Monica
what's-her-name never occur.
To me, and admittedly, most
of TV's critical zeitgeist, that's a
ridiculous oversimplification. Sure,
Bartlet was a Democrat, and sure,
the conservative point of view is
hard to find inside a left-leaning
White House. But to me, the pro-
gram was that rare political con-
struction that managed to separate
itself from party boundaries. Set
in an era before partisanship and
gridlock became so disgustingly
pronounced, the show depicted
characters on both sides of the aisle
as selfless individuals motivated
by their core beliefs about the best
way to run the country.
Staff members in the Bartlet
White House went out of their
way to consider all sides of an
argument, making their final
decisions based not upon party
affiliation or political conve-
nience, but on the maximum
amount of benefit to the country
as a whole. Throughout their two
terms in office, our friends on
Pennsylvania Avenue were will-
ing to reverse their positions after
closely reviewing the facts. They
expanded their horizons by hir-
ing Ainsley Hayes, one of their
most vocal conservative critics,
because she was "smart." And
after his daughter's kidnapping,
they advised President Bartlet

to invoke the 25th Amendment
and cede temporary control of
the White House to a Republican
Speaker of the House, a move that
the neo-conservative writer's
room of"24" would've considered
political suicide. Even inthe post-
Sorkin era, the show remained
decidedly idealistic, a universe
in which negative ads were truly
a sign of desperation and a live-
over-the-airwaves appeal to vot-
ers made the difference between a
concession speech and a surprise
rebound in New Hampshire.
In a scene from an early epi-
sode of "The West Wing," Donna,
assistant to Josh, the White
House deputy chief of staff, won-
ders why the President won't give
the federal budget surplus back
to the citizenry so she can buy a
DVD player. She promises, prom-
ises, promises to buy American.
"We don't trust you," Josh says.
"Why not?" Donna asks, dis-
mayed.
"We're Democrats," he replies.
"You shouldn't have voted for us."
No politically motivated equiv-
ocation. No attempt to retain a
potential supporter by sugarcoat-
ing the truth. Just a quick, educa-
tional snippet of party platform
analysis, and it's back to work for
their country. If only Washington
really ran so smoothly.

ing its original broadcast run.
