Members of group 
arrested for drug, 
gun possesion at 

Georgia Southern ‘U’

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

MUSIC Matters’ SpringFest 

headliner Migos is no stranger 
to the spotlight — both from 
public acclaim and criminal 
acts.

Returning to campus after 

a February appearance, the 
rappers have released singles 
like 
“Versace” 
and 
“Fight 

Night,” 
which 
defined 
the 

modern Atlanta hip-hop scene, 
and started a worldwide dance 
phenomenon with “Look at 
My Dab.” The rappers rappers 
have a reputation for being the 
kind of high-energy performers 
SpringFest 
has 
selected 
to 

positive response in the past. 
However, Migos has another 
college-based 
reputation 
as 

well: The last time the group 

performed on a college campus, 
police officers had to cut the 
show short.

Almost exactly a year ago, 

at Georgia State University’s 
Spring Bling — a banner concert 
similar to SpringFest — local law 
enforcement arrested two Migos 
group members and several 
individuals travelling as their 
entourage. Rappers Quavo and 
Offset were also charged with 
felony possession of cocaine, 
Oxycontin 
and 
codeine 
in 

addition to charges of carrying a 
loaded weapon in a school zone, 
Rolling Stone reported. Offset 
was briefly jailed and then 
released last December.

MUSIC 
Matters 
President 

Jibran 
Ahmed, 
a 
Business 

senior, said the organization 
has been very clear with Migos’ 
management 
about 
limiting 

personal issues.

“We’ve gotten the OK and 

approval 
from 
all 
relevant 

University partners,” he said. 
“We are being as careful and

Columnist Ben 

Shapiro discusses 

impact of 

microaggressions

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Ben 
Shapiro, 
a 
noted 

conservative 
columnist 
and 

author, discussed freedom of 

speech Thursday evening in 
the Rackham Graduate School 
Amphitheatre, 
drawing 
a 

crowd of approximately 300.

The event — hosted by 

the 
Young 
Americans 
for 

Freedom with funding from 
Central Student Government 
— highlighted issues Shapiro 
described as attacks on freedom 
of speech and a free society, 
such as microaggressions and 
the concept of privilege.

The event follows a week 

in which freedom of speech 
has been a prominent issue 
on campus, following anti-
Islam 
chalkings 
on 
the 

Diag 
alongside 
pro-Trump 

messages, 
which 
garnered 

national media attention and 
prompted discussions about 
hate speech and the safety of 
Muslim students.

CSG discussed the issue at 

length in their final meeting of 
the semester on Tuesday and 
ultimately passed a resolution 

making 
the 
University 

a 
sanctuary 
campus 
for 

immigrants.

Shapiro began his talk by 

addressing 
the 
chalkings, 

saying he wouldn’t normally 
support 
Trump 
except 
in 

instances people are offended 
by messages of support for 
Trump, proceeding to write 
“Trump 2016” on a chalkboard.

“There is only one thing that 

I can do to support Trump,” he

Law professor 

criticizes 

international laws 
on displaced peoples 

By GRACE CANFIELD

For the Daily

Law Prof. James Hathaway 

gave a talk Thursday evening in 
the Hatcher Graduate Library 
Gallery titled “Policies on the 
Refugee 
Crisis”, 
discussing 

flaws in the refugee system 
worldwide.

Hathaway is the founding 

director of the Law School’s 
Program 
in 
Refugee 
and 

Asylum Law, and his work is 
regularly cited by international 
courts.

Thursday’s lecture centered 

on 
Hathaway’s 
hope 
that 

there will be an international 
effort to revamp the model 
most countries use in dealing 
with refugees. Hathaway said 
current models do not require 
more funding, but rather the 
funds 
individual 
countries 

have appropriated to hosting 
refugees need to be more 
efficiently allocated.

“We have more than enough 

money in the system to provide 
an 
immediate 
international 

response — to provide the 
dignified protection for the 
duration of risk, to move people 
to new homes — without 
spending one dollar more,” 
Hathaway said.

The talk was facilitated by 

the University of Michigan’s 

Global Scholars Program in 
coordination 
with 
Amnesty 

International, a global human 
rights organization.

The current refugee crisis 

encompasses 
19.5 
million 

people seeking sanctuary in 
countries outside of their own, 
who often very few options in 
developed first world countries. 
According 
to 
Amnesty 

International, 86 percent of 
refugees end up settling in 
developing countries that often 
don’t have the resources or 
infrastructure to provide for an 
influx of this scale. As conflict 
in Syria and other areas of the 
world has unfolded over past 
months, causing a surge in 
refugees, international groups 
havecalled on more developed 
countries like the U.S. to accept 
more refugees.

Speaking specifically to the 

procedures to revamp refugee 
laws, Hathaway said the only 
viable approach is through 
international coalitions such as 
the United Nations.

“We see scenes like this 

of refugees in tiny boats, 
surrendering their well-being 
to smugglers in very dangerous 
conditions,” 
Hathaway 
said. 

“We see horrid images of 
refugees 
surviving 
massive 

difficult overnight treks only 
to be confronted by barbed-
wire barriers when they get to 
a place they thought was safe.”

Kenneth 
Grunow, 
a 

representative of the Detroit 
chapter Amnesty International 
who also spoke during the 
event, called for more increased

More than 

400,000 gallons of 
contaminated waste 

spilled into water

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
city 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 

has contacted the Michigan 
Department of Environmental 
Quality for the second time 
this year with concerns about 
contaminated 
city 
water 

sources. At the heels of an 
investigation regarding a plume 
of dioxane — a carcinogenic 
chemical that has made its 
way into the Huron River — an 
Ann Arbor Public Works crew 
member discovered a sewage 
overflow into Malletts Creek 
Wednesday morning.

Though Public Works had 

already 
restored 
the 
pipe, 

it is estimated that close to 
400,000 gallons of sewage 
have overflowed into the creek 
over the past two weeks. The 
overflow was discovered in a 
sanitary sewer manhole near 
the intersection of Washtenaw 
Avenue and Huron Parkway 
and is believed to have been 
caused by roots that had grown 
through the sewer pipes and 
thus blocked the sewage flow.

Water 
Quality 
Manager 

Jennifer Lawson said despite 
the volume of sewage added 
to the creek, the city does not 
forsee any health concerns due 
to the relatively slow flow from

Almost 200 students 
attend second annual 

event

By JENNIFER MEER

Daily Staff Reporter

Nearly 200 students walked the 

red carpet on campus Thursday 
night at the 2016 Entrepreneurial 
Oscars, held at the University of 
Michigan Museum of Art.

The evening was hosted by 

MPowered 
Entrepreneurship, 

a student organization whose 
mission is to introduce students to 
entrepreneurship opportunities, 
with the aim of honoring the 

year’s most innovative students, 
student organizations, startups 
and creations.

Prior to the event, students 

nominated student groups or 
individuals 
in 
21 
categories, 

including Most Impact in Health/
Philanthropy, Best New Idea, 
Best Business Model and Most 
Educational Impact.

LSA junior Sydney Bigelow, 

president 
of 
MPowered 

Entrepreneurship, 
said 
the 

event was held to highlight 
organizations 
and 
individuals 

who have made an impact on 
campus.

“The 
purpose 
of 
the 

Entrepreneurial Oscars is to bring 
together all of these amazing 

student organizations, student 
leaders, student startups and 
individuals within the University 
of Michigan community that 
are just doing amazing things 
on campus,” she said. “That are 
changing the landscape, that are 
changing the world — and we 
want to recognize them for that.”

Bigelow 
noted 
that 
the 

awards were not limited to 
entrepreneurial 
endeavors, 

but 
offered 
to 
any 
student 

organization that has made an 
impact within the last year.

She said the event gives 

students 
the 
opportunity 

to get to know others in the 
University community who have

CAPS premieres its 
spring student-driven 
fundraising campaign

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan’s 

Counseling and Psychological 
Services launched a spring 
fundraising 
campaign, 
Help 

CAPS Catch Up, Wednesday. 
The campaign was created by 
six 
undergraduate 
students 

hoping to increase the funding 
for CAPS on campus. According 
to a press release, the campaign 
gathered 3,500 views online 
within 10 hours of its unveiling.

Help CAPS Catch Up began 

as a letter-writing campaign 
accessible 
to 
all 
students, 

faculty 
and 
community 

members 
related 
to 
the 

University. It centered around 
ideals of support and positivity 
to give a voice to community 

members wishing to speak 
out 
about 
mental 
health 

resources needed on campus, 
in lieu of blaming University 
of Michigan officials. It is now 
fully fundraising-focused.

Overall, 
CAPS 
said 
they 

hope this campaign will raise 
their budget from just under 
$3 million to $4 million. The 
increase would fund the need 
for rapid counseling options 
through an increase in staff 
so that they can be readily 
available 
for 
appointments. 

CAPS 
will 
continue 
their 

campaign 
by 
having 
an 

informational 
table 
in 
the 

Diag April 11 and attending 
Central Student Government’s 
Mental Health Speak Out in the 
Michigan Union the same day.

the pipe.

“From a public health and 

safety standpoint, there is no 
concern. It was a relatively 
small amount over a long period 
of time,” Lawson said. “Forty-
thousand sounds like a lot but it 
was over a few weeks so it’s like 
a garden hose flowing into the 
creek. But it’s not something 
you want to see in any urban 
sewage system.”

City Councilmember Sabra 

Briere (D–Ward 1) said these 
occurrences happen frequently 
both on public and private lands 
despite efforts to avoid them 
through 
constant 
cleaning 

and checking of underground 
pipes.

“The plan is always to 

avoid these overflows,” Briere 
said. “It is difficult for us to 
anticipate where there will be 
a problem. We have invested 
significantly and will continue 
to invest in our infrastructure, 
which is what we have to do.”

According to a statement 

released 
by 
the 
city, 
the 

overflow will not affect those 
using the Huron River for 
recreational 
purposes 
due 

to how the sewage will be 
diluted. 
Similar 
assurances 

have been made regarding the 
dioxane plume. The state has 
recently stepped forward to 
assume 
more 
responsibility 

in cleaning up the plume by 
tightening its standards of how 
much dioxane can be permitted 
within drinking water.

Lawson said there are no 

communities 
that 
will 
be 

impacted 
by 
contaminated 

water 
because 
the 

contamination is downstream 
from the plant that draw water 
from the Huron River, the 
watershed Malletts Creek is a 
part of, and that there are no 
plans as of now to clean up the 
river due to what she referred 
to as the scale nature of the 
small influx of sewage.

“There are no intentions to 

clean up because (the sewage) 
is gone. There are maintenance 
activities that will continue,” 
Lawson said. “The city has 362 
miles of sanitary sewage pipes 
and this was an area we haven’t 
checked recently. It’s on the 
watch list now because of all 
the trees in the area.”

awareness and effort in finding a 
permanent solution.

“What we need to do is to 

find it in our hearts and our 
determination to help these 
people with support,” he said. 
“With a place to go and try to get 
them in out of the cold and give 

them a place that they can call 
their own again.”

Event 
coordinator 
Tiffany 

Chau, a Public Policy sophomore 
and Global Scholar Program 
member, said she was inspired 
to host the event because of her 
father, who was a refugee from 
Vietnam.

“I realized that my ethnicity 

and my cultural background isn’t 
the only thing that defines me, 

but it is something that defines 
me and I have a lot of stories that 
I can share,” Chau said.

Amnesty International also 

provided a petition at the event 
addressed to U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell (D—Dearborn), urging 
her to call for an increase in the 
number of refugees resettled in 
the United States among other 
requests.

selecting Migos for the concert

established relationship with 
the University of Michigan. 
Michigan football coach Jim 
Harbaugh hosted the artists 
during “Signing of the Stars,” 
his grand unveiling of the 
team’s 2016 recruiting class in 
February. Harbaugh and the 
rappers have also exchanged 
tweets in the past, and a video 
was released of them dabbing 
in support of the football team 
before a game against Ohio 
State on Twitter.

“They’re passionate about 

Michigan, 
and 
Michigan 

is passionate about them,” 
Ahmed said.

 In an e-mail interview 

about 
Migos’ 
upcoming 

performance, 
University

the 
group’s 

past, 
but 
wrote 
MUSIC 

Matters and the Center for 
Campus 
Involvement 
are 

working 
closely 
with 
the 

Division of Public Safety and 
Security to manage the event.

“We have good planning 

practices in place for an array 
of events that help us avoid 
issues that sometimes pop up 
on other campuses,” he wrote.

DPSS 
spokesperson 

Diane Brown said it was not 
University policy to comment 
on security measures.

Past 
performers 
at 

SpringFest include Common, 
2 Chainz, Ben Folds and 
J.

These

philanthropic

also lined up with MUSIC 
Matters’ goals, as Common’s 
work with underserved youth 
in Chicago corresponded with 
the 
student 
organization’s 

charity in Detroit. Migos 
doesn’t 
have 
a 
similar 

background, but Ahmed said 
he 
hopes 
the 
experience 

of SpringFest prompts the 
rappers to get more involved 
in philanthropic endevors.

“I hope we inspire Migos 

to 
be 
more

community,” he said. “They 
can create that space for 
students to come together.”

similar aspirations within their 
startup companies or student 
organizations.

“We want to be able to 

recognize 
people, 
see 
these 

other organizations that are 
doing similar things — things 
that maybe complement what 
your organization is doing — and 
find out ways that we can work 
together and at least get to know 
each other,” she said. “I think 
this is one big event that helps do 
that.”

The 
award 
for 
Most 

Educational Impact award went 
to TEDxUofM, a student group 
that provides a platform for 
University community members 
to share their ideas on innovative 
topics.

LSA 
sophomore 
Sophia 

Svoboda, who is one of the 
co-directors of the organization, 
said having a community of 
entrepreneurs on campus had a 
number of benefits.

“This event is a great way for 

all of the different student orgs 
and 
entrepreneurial-focused 

groups to get together and build 
a stronger community,” she said. 
“Because sometimes you need to 
have that support and be able to 
talk to others.”

Nine of the 21 awards went to 

groups or individuals for their 
participation in 1000 Pitches, an 
annual MPowered competition 
that allows students to pitch 
ideas and solutions to problems. 
Winners receive $1,000 toward 
implementing their idea.

Neuroscience 
graduate 

student Ramses Alcaide took 
home two awards for his startup 
company Neurable, one of which 
was for his participation in 1000 

Pitches.

The company’s product is a 

brain-computer interface that 
allows people to control devices 
like cars with only their brain 
activity.

Alcaide said recognition for 

entrepreneurship is important 
because it encourages people to 
move forward with their dreams 
despite 
the 
difficult 
work 

inherent in achieving them.

“It’s good to give recognition 

to the entrepreneurial groups 
here at the University, especially 
because entrepreneurship is a 
very difficult road, and it keeps 
people motivated,” Alcaide said. 
“If you do entrepreneurship 
right, every day and every 
minute is work. You’re pushing 
your company and your dreams 
forward. 
That’s 
a 
full-time 

thing. Getting recognition for 
that gives you the energy to keep 
going.”

said, “when there are precious 
snowflakes who whine and cry 
when people write pro-Trump 
things on the ground.”

Shapiro also addressed the 

controversy he has recently 
attracted at events on other 
campuses, such as a February 
speech at California State 
University, Los Angeles.

At CSULA, a police escort 

was required for Shapiro’s 
exit 
following 
his 
speech, 

according to tweets Shapiro 
sent out at the time. The talk at 
CSULA was initially cancelled 
by CSULA President William 
Covino, who stated at the 
time he wanted to reschedule 
the event and involve other 
speakers to create a diversity 
of viewpoints.

Shapiro charged that CSULA 

was stopping a diversity of 
opinion by preventing his talk, 
saying that “diversity” is one of 
the words liberals frequently 
use, but only use in the context 
of race and not in reference to 
diversity of opinion.

“Diversity here meant that 

I had to shut up,” he said. 
“The kind of diversity that the 
Left loves is restricted... to 
diversity of skin color.”

At the University, flyers put 

up by YAF promoting the event 
were torn down across campus 
and an advertisement put out 
by the group was vandalized, 
according 
to 
the 
group’s 

website.

LSA 
sophomore 
Grant 

Strobl, one of the event’s 
organizers, 
said 
Shapiro’s 

talk offered a space to hear 
opposing 
viewpoints 
in 
a 

moderated context.

“The event was a resounding 

success,” he said. “This event 
impacted campus by giving 
an example of an event where 
we all can listen to ideas that 
we might agree with and do it 
civilly. We need to have more 
discussions on campus without 
worrying about it being shut 
down.”

Talking 
about 
another 

one 
of 
his 
five 
topics, 

microaggressions — common, 
seemingly minor but offensive 
comments often directed at a 
minority group or individual 
— Shapiro told an anecdote 
of a time when he called a 
transgender 
woman 
“sir” 

on national television, and 
she responded with a joking 
threat.

He said the other panelists 

he was with then reprimanded 
him for his offensive remark, 
validating 
the 
woman’s 

aggressive response. Allowing 
this sort of response to a 
microaggression, 
he 
added, 

infringes on his right to speak 
freely and make his own 
decisions.

“You can not like what I say, 

but that doesn’t give you the 
right to put your hands on me,” 
he said. “All of this creates a 

very dangerous world. The 
Left is taking a battering ram to 
those two fundamental bases 
of Western civilization: You 
are responsible for your own 
actions and in a free society 
you can say things without 
people assaulting you.”

Shapiro also touched on 

privilege, saying the concept 
of white privilege is a myth 
and can instead be replaced 
by other types of privilege 
like 
two-parent 
household 

privilege and crime privilege. 
To back up his point, he 
cited a series of statistics 
that showed children raised 
in single parent households 
do disproportionately worse 
than those from two-parent 
households, regardless of race. 
 

Looking at criminal justice, 

Shapiro argued that racial 
profiling 
does 
not 
occur, 

and instead police stop or 
arrest 
minorities 
at 
rates 

proportional to the rates they 
commit crimes. He said the 
easiest way to avoid being 
arrested is to avoid committing 
a crime.

“It turns out that if you 

want to avoid prison, the 
easiest way to do that is to 
actually not commit a crime,” 
he said. “Here’s a fact about 
the supposedly evil and racist 
justice 
system: 
It 
under-

prosecutes murder in minority 
communities.”

Several 
national 
reports 

show that people of color 
are often arrested at higher 
rates than white individuals. 
According to the Washington 
Post, Black drivers are twice 
as likely to be arrested during 
a 
traffic 
stop 
as 
whites. 

Additionally, 
in 
Dearborn, 

more than half of the arrests 
in 2011 and 2012 were of Black 
citizens. 
However, 
Blacks 

only make up 4 percent of the 
town’s population, according 
to DiversityInc.

Addressing 
a 
question 

about how to participate in 
debates with supporters of 
Bernie Sanders — who won the 
Michigan primary and has a 
large support base on campus 
— Shapiro said one should 
ask questions or simply not 
participate in discussion.

“One of the things I always 

urge people to do is ask 
questions,” 
he 
said. 
“The 

second 
recommendation 
is 

don’t engage the guy. I mean, 
come on, you only have so 
many breaths left in your life.”

LSA 
freshman 
Michael 

Smith said Shapiro’s talk gave 
a forum for students to learn 
about different sides of the 
political debate.

“I think a lot of people are 

riled up because of the recent 
political election,” he said. 
“But they don’t really take the 
time to look at the other side. 
If they did, it would moderate 
a 
lot 
of 
people’s 
heated 

opinions.”

U of M announces 
collaboration with 
Toyota Motor 
Company

The University of Michigan will 

partner with Toyota this summer 
in creating a driverless car research 
and testing site in Ann Arbor, the 
University announced Thursday.

At the facility — the third of 

its kind in the country — Toyota 
will fund research focused on 
robotics and artificial intelligence 
in hopes of speeding up work on 
autonomous vehicles. The site is set 
to open in July and will eventually 
staff 50 individuals.The effort is 
a new component of the Toyota 
Research Institute, the company’s 
$1 billion investment in driverless, 
connected and 

automated vehicle-related 

facilities and material science 
technology. 

College of Engineering Prof. 

Ryan Eustice and Associate Prof. 
Edwin Olson will join the facility as 
full-time area leads, and will retain 
part-time faculty positions at the 
University.

Toyota is already a Leadership 

Circle partner with the University’s 
Mobility Transformation Center. 
MTC is a research partnership 
dedicated to pioneering a 
commercially viable system of 
connected and automated vehicles. 
MTC also operates Mcity, the 
country’s only simulated city for 
testing automated automobiles.

Rep. and family 
of Marine seek 
answers in death 

The family of Raheel Siddiqui, 

a 20-year old Marine from Taylor, 
Mich., is raising questions about 
the circumstances of Siddiqui’s 
death in a South Carolina boot 
camp last month, the Detroit Free 
Press reported Thursday. 

Siddiqui died 11 days into his 

training at the camp. A casualty 
report from the Marines stated 
Siddiqui passed out during an 
exercise, woke up and proceeded 
to jump over a wall, where he 
then allegedly fell to his death. 
The family’s attorney told the 
Free Press it was hard to believe 
Siddiqui was suicidal, and brought 
up issues of possible hazing or 
discrimination. 

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell 

(D–Dearborn) — whose district 
includes Taylor — commented on 
Siddiqui’s Muslim faith and raised 
similar concerns in an open letter 
to Robert Neller, U.S. Marine Corps 
Commandant General. She also 
questioned the firing of Lt. Col. 
Joshua Kissoon, who was released 
by the boot camp a day before 
Siddiqui’s death. 

Both Dingell and the family 

attorney asked the Marines to 
release a timeline of the full 
investigation into Siddiqui’s death, 
and to preserve all related records 
therein. 

Siddiqui was a first generation 

Pakistani-American and is survived 
by both parents and a sister.

F

lip 
through 
the 
teal 

journal I always carry in 
my backpack, and among 

torn-out pages 
and 
blocks 

of 
diagonally 

written 
paragraphs, 
you’ll 
find 

this 
sentence 

buried in a list. 
It’s an odd list, 
haphazardly 
scrawled 
in 
two 
very 

distinct sets of 
penmanship. 
The phrase sits there on the blue 
line, scrunched together by my 
frantic, 
cursive 
handwriting. 

Originally, 
this 
sentence 
was 

intended as one of many broad, 
innocuous prompts for a project 
my best friend suggested we do to 
keep in touch with one another.

We each had to write down a 

few questions. They didn’t need to 
be specific or extremely detailed. 
In fact, the broader the question, 
the 
better. 
Really, 
the 
only 

requirement was the question had 
to make you think. Once we had 
our list of prompts established, 
we were supposed to — within the 
course of a year — spontaneously 
respond to whatever question we 
felt was relevant in the moment 
and send these thoughts to each 
other in letters.

Well, someday soon, my friend 

is going to receive a large envelope 
of overdue letters — a delayed 
correspondence that’s mostly due to 
my mindset being: If I wait a little 
while longer, I’ll think of much 
better responses. I keep returning 
to the prompts, refining bits here 
and adding more there. Yet, no 
prompt has as many pages devoted 
to it as the “distance” one does.

“Tell me about distance.”
It was a question disguised as 

an imperative. Perhaps, in reality, 
it was a bit of both. Maybe it 
was just an attempt to ask for an 
explanation for the undefinable 
concept that regularly permeates 
my thoughts in various forms.

I remember sitting in my first 

apartment as a sophomore and 
chatting 
with 
my 
roommate’s 

parents when they were visiting. 
Both of them attended college in the 
Upper Peninsula. They understood 
my references to random Upper 
Peninsula towns and landmarks and 
could relate with the experience of 
going to a university located several 
hours from home. My roommate’s 
father — in an attempt to continue 
the sense of camaraderie — told me 
I was smart to find a school that was 
as far away from home as possible 
but still in-state.

That hadn’t been my intention, 

but, as I looked at a map later, I 
realized I’d basically done just 
that. I had moved from one corner 
of the state to another. I even 
switched time zones. I’ve lived 

in Michigan my entire life, and 
I’m an in-state student. Yet, I’d 
be remiss to deny that sometimes 
I feel I relate more with out-
of-state students than with my 
fellow Michiganders on campus. 
Honestly, I never even used that 
phrase until I came downstate. 
I’ve always just been a Yooper.

Ever since I left my hometown, 

distance became the ever-apparent 
constant in my life — whether I 
was actively trying to create it 
or to diminish it. It’s a continual 
negotiation 
of 
space. 
For 
me, 

roughly 470 miles apart are two very 
different lives and two very different 
definitions of who I am. For some 
students, 470 miles is miniscule in 
comparison to the distances they 
travel to return home. Others are 
dumbfounded when I tell them a 
trip back to my hometown requires 
about an eight-hour drive.

While you could easily quantify 

the space in a matter of miles, the 
disconnect is often immeasurable. 
My phone regularly buzzes with 
Snapchat notifications from an old 
friend who now lives in Pittsburgh, 
friends going to college in the Upper 

Peninsula and a friend studying 
art in Grand Rapids. My voicemail 
inbox is full of missed calls from my 
parents as attempts to contact me are 
hindered by my cluttered schedule 
and an hour time difference. I’m 
grateful technology allows me to 
stay connected with everyone, but 
it’s a conversation that relies upon 
mere snapshots of our lives and 
clusters of text messages. Visits back 
up north transform into playing 
games of catch-up as my friends 
and I attempt to retrace everything 
that’s happened since the last time 
we all saw one another. Roaming 
around familiar streets fills me 
with a peculiar sense of recognition 
that’s rooted primarily in nostalgia, 
and each subsequent trip leaves me 
feeling more and more like a visitor 
in my hometown.

Yet, I can’t deny space was 

exactly what I wanted. Distance 
wasn’t a priority, but it certainly 
was an advantage when I departed 
for college. I can’t detach from the 
past experiences or places that 
shaped me nor would I ever want 
to. However, I needed to create 
some space from that town and 
from that old definition of myself. 
I wanted anonymity and a blank 
slate to redraw the contours of my 

life. Regardless of whether it’s been 
four months or four years since I 
left, I continually miss my family, 
my friends, roaming around trails 
in the woods and driving along 
back roads with my best friend 
as he teased me for driving too 
slowly. But as distances widened, 
the resulting space provided me 
with room to grow and to question 
the world. In turn, my faint voice 
found the opportunity to traverse 
spaces that extended far beyond 
the rural and conceptual borders 
it was accustomed to.

If my time at the University 

has taught me anything, it’s that 
distance is developmental, and more 
often than not, it’s far more than 
a physical measurement of miles. 
There’s distance between ideologies 
and experience. Throughout the 
years, 
I’ve 
encountered 
voices 

calling to diminish obstacles and 
gaps created by discrimination, 
indifference, 
ignorance 
and 

inequality. We, as students, immerse 
ourselves in these discussions and 
continually seek to uncover voices 
previously 
excluded 
from 
the 

conversation. As both a student and 
a writer, I’ve seen distance diminish 
as viewpoints align, but it’s very 
evident some gaps and inequities on 
campus, and in society, are still far 
from being closed.

Often, 
I’ve 
heard 
college 

described as a bubble, insulating 
and distancing students from the 
realities of world. Yet, research 
conducted by Richard Arum and 
Josipa Roksa suggests this distance 
grows and our engagement with 
the world may drop after we 
graduate. 
According 
to 
survey 

data, 40 percent of recent college 
graduates rarely participate in 
conversations concerning politics 
or public affairs. Regardless of 
whether physical distance expands, 
separation from an institution of 
learning shouldn’t deter us from 
interacting with the world. Rather, 
it should spur us to engage more 
and to continue conversations we 
began in the classroom.

As both the school year and 

my college career rapidly come 
to a close, I expect distance 
will continue to remain at the 
forefront of my mind for the 
next few months. I walk along 
State Street on my way home and 
wonder whether these streets, 
these buildings and these familiar 
scenes will dissipate into the 
same nostalgic atmosphere that 
comes to mind when I think of my 
hometown. I think of the various 
parts of the country my friends 
are dispersing to and where I’ll 
eventually find myself next, and I 
think of how far I’ll soon be from 
the dialogues and discussions I’m 
accustomed to. But, I take solace 
in the fact that distances can be 
bridged as well as created.

n 
light 
of 
the 
racist 

chalkings on the Diag last 
week and violent rhetoric 

across the nation at large, Muslim, 
Middle Eastern and North African 
students have been confronted 
with a seemingly hostile climate 
on campus. When we witnessed 
these public attacks in the name 
of free speech that targeted both 
our faith and our place at this 
University of Michigan, the fear, 
apprehension and isolation of the 
current political cycle suddenly 
seemed justified.

But we also witnessed another 

movement shortly thereafter: an 
outpouring of support and love 
from individuals and organizations 
alike on campus. The examples 
of genuine solidarity are endless: 
a resolution passed by Central 
Student 
Government, 
proactive 

chalk 
on 
the 
Diag 
Tuesday 

afternoon spreading a message 
of solidarity, a collective letter 
of support signed by more than 
50 
student 
organizations 
and 

commitments from outside groups 
like the Open School in Ann Arbor 
and the Arab American Anti-
Discrimination 
Committee 
in 

Dearborn, to standing with Muslim 
students. The expressions of love 
and unity have not gone unnoticed.

Thank you for your support. 

The Muslim Students’ Association 
is grateful to anyone and everyone 
taking a stand against the vitriol 
and hate exposed on campus.

There is a lot of work yet to be 

done. The reappearance of bigoted 
messages just yesterday — and 
the 
administration’s 
hesitation 

to remove them — is indicative of 
that. We seek to root out actions, 
both internal and external, that 
center around excluding groups 

on campus and turning them 
against one other. We will not 
stand for injustice perpetrated 
toward any identity. We hold the 
Muslim community to the highest 
standard 
of 
protecting 
other 

groups as well.

We look forward, though, to 

building 
on 
the 
constructive 

responses, to a joining of hands 
between 
Muslims 
and 
non-

Muslims, and student groups and 
community members, to mold this 
campus into a more inclusive one. 
Our tradition is one of healing 
and cooperation, and the MSA is 
devoted to fostering the seeds that 
have been sown in the last few 
weeks. May God ease and facilitate 
this effort and spread its rewards.

“I’ve heard college 

described as a 

bubble. Yet ... our 

engagement with the 
world may drop after 

we graduate.”

T

he LGBTQ community has made 
impressive advances in recent years, 
and we celebrate every victory that 

brings us closer to full equality for all. But there 
is still a lot of work to be done before LGBTQ 
Michiganders cease to be treated as second-
class citizens.

The 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision 

legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide is a 
significant milestone, but it has also sparked a 
backlash among those who oppose equality for 
the LGBTQ community. As an active member 
of Outlaws — Michigan Law’s LGBTQ student 
organization — I know many Michigan citizens 
and students are watching with concern as 
more anti-LGBTQ bills are introduced and 
passed across the country.

Among the most troubling of these bills 

are so-called Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act legislation, like those currently causing 
controversy in Mississippi, Georgia and North 
Carolina. While each bill differs slightly, the 
effects of this type of legislation includes 
limiting the power of local governments and 
extending 
antidiscrimination 
protections 

to LGBTQ people to allowing businesses 
to refuse to serve LGBTQ people by simply 
saying they have a religious objection to 
doing so. Not only do these bills deny LGBTQ 
people equal treatment and expose them 
to discrimination in their everyday lives, 
they are also simply unnecessary to protect 
religious freedoms.

State RFRA bills are a prophylactic layer 

atop the protections already afforded by the 
U.S. Constitution and the federal RFRA law. 
The federal RFRA clearly states that it is 
intended to protect individuals who want to 
practice their religion, as long as the practice 
doesn’t place a burden on others. For example, 
a prisoner who wants access to religious 
materials isn’t harming anyone. Unlike 
the federal RFRA, which only applies to 
government intrusion into religious practices, 
the state-level RFRA would allow a religious 
objection to be used in interactions between 
individuals. State RFRA legislation that allows 
businesses to claim a “religious objection” and 
legally refuse service to someone is in fact 
harmful to others.

The problem is that in Michigan, LGBTQ 

people do not have equal protection under 
the state’s civil rights law. Most of our state 
law protections against discrimination are 
found in the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act 
(ELCRA), which prohibits discrimination 
based upon religion, race, color, national 
origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status 
or marital status. The law does not include 
any protections for LGTBQ people, meaning 
that LGBTQ Michiganders fired or denied 
housing simply because of their status as 
LGBTQ have no recourse under the ELCRA, 
unlike someone who is fired for their race or 
religion.

The result is that a gay man or a transgender 

woman could be denied employment strictly 
on the grounds of sexual or gender identity, 
not on their qualification or merits. LGBTQ 
people could be denied housing or turned away 
from a hospital if a health care provider states a 
religious objection. A police officer could refuse 
to protect someone who is LGBTQ or of another 
religion, or whose behavior they object to on 
religious grounds. Is that how we treat people 
in Michigan? The LGBTQ community is made 
up of our neighbors, our family, our friends, our 
coworkers, even members of our church. They 
deserve protection.

Despite the lack of state law protections for 

LGBTQ persons and the religious protections 
extended in the federal Constitution and under 
federal law, Michigan politicians continue to 
push forward harmful RFRA-like legislation 
in our state. Although Gov. Rick Snyder denied 
that it was a RFRA-type bill, legislation signed 

into law last year, which allows faith-based 
adoption agencies to deny service based 
on religious objections — even when they 
accept state funding — clearly discriminates 
against LGBTQ people and others. The same 
discrimination that is illegal when exercised 
against other members of the community is 
acceptable under laws such as these when 
aimed at the LGBTQ community. 

Michiganders don’t have to look far to learn 

that RFRA bills are bad for equality, bad for our 
community and bad for business.

In North Carolina, more than 119 business 

leaders signed a letter to Gov. Pat McCrory 
urging him to repeal the state’s recently passed 
RFRA law. Employer PayPal announced it 
was canceling a major investment in North 
Carolina, resulting in a loss of at least 400 
jobs and $3.6 million dollars. Another major 
corporation, Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, stated 
it was “reevaluating” its plans for a $20 million 
project in Durham.

In Georgia, House Bill 757 passed through 

the House and Senate before the governor 
vetoed the bill after public outcry. The 
pushback to the bill was swift and serious, 
with major employers (Home Depot, Coca-
Cola, Google and Microsoft) opposing the 
bill. Atlanta, “the Hollywood of the South,” 
also received criticism from members of the 
entertainment industry, an industry that 
added approximately $1.7 billion to the state’s 
economy just last year. Passage of the bill could 
also have disqualified Atlanta from hosting an 
upcoming Super Bowl, with the NFL stating 
that the law would be a relevant factor in the 
hosting decision. Agencies within the state 
estimate the bill could have cost between $1 
billion and $2 billion.

In Mississippi, Gov. Phil Bryant signed 

House Bill 1523 this week, which protects 
private businesses that discriminate against 
LGBTQ for proclaimed religious or moral 
reasons. Major employers in the state, 
including Tyson Foods, AT&T, IBM, MGM 
Resorts International, Nissan and Toyota, 
have all objected to the bill. The Mississippi 
Manufacturers Association has expressed 
its fear that the law will affect business and 
development opportunities in the state. New 
York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive 
order banning non-essential state travel to 
Mississippi, which follows a similar ban on 
nonessential state travel to North Carolina.

In the case of every RFRA-type bill, 

supporters claim they only intend to protect 
people of faith. But religious organizations and 
individuals are already protected by the U.S. 
Constitution. Meanwhile, it’s still legal in most 
states to deny housing, services or employment 
to LGBTQ people.

Freedom of religion is one of the cornerstones 

of our democracy, and no one is asking religious 
organizations to perform same-sex marriages 
against their will. But LGBTQ people do have 
the right to equal treatment under the law.

Opposition to RFRA-type bills is not anti-

religion, it’s pro-equality. In fact, many members 
of the LGBTQ community are religious 
themselves. This isn’t about curbing the rights 
of religious individuals and organizations, it’s 
about preventing anti-LGBTQ legislation from 
harming our communities under the guise of 
religious protection.

In Michigan, advocates are working hard to 

extend civil rights protections under ELCRA 
to LGBTQ people, but it will take time. During 
that time, it’s almost certain that RFRA-type 
legislation will be introduced in Michigan. 
When and if these bills start moving through 
our legislature, you can be sure the LGBTQ 
community will make our voices heard. We 
hope you’ll join us.

By DANIELLE IMMERMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Let it be known that I’m a 

massive fan of all things ’60s, 
’70s and ’80s. When Drake and 
Future 
say 

“What a time 
to be alive,” 
I’m 
pretty 

sure 
they’re 

really talking 
about 
those 

three decades, 
because 
it 

really 
was 

a time to be 
alive. It was 
the time to be 
alive. It was 
mildly 
more 

acceptable 
to 
be 
politically 

incorrect. Crazy kids worrying 
about school were hard to come 
by. And of course, there was the 
music.

Lacking the overproduced 

tone that embodies modern 
music, the ’70s is probably the 
last decade that was really dom-
inated by pure music — pure in 
the sense that popular music 
hinged on a certain level of vocal 
talent and instrumental creativ-
ity. The guitar still had a voice of 
its own and studios weren’t nec-
essarily manufacturing bands 
for profit and pop stars for radio 
sound. Instead, you had leg-
ends being legends: Queen, Pink 
Floyd, The Who. And since we 
can’t all be legends, there were 
also the talented bands with 
several hits that you’d still flock 
to see live — chiefly, and for con-
versation’s sake, Cheap Trick.

With 
unquestionable 
hits 

like “Surrender” and “I Want 
You To Want Me,” Cheap Trick 
undoubtedly should be remem-
bered. These songs are classic 

jams that went into shaping the 
’70s, but that’s about it. These 
two Cheap Trick songs are prob-
ably the only two Cheap Trick 
songs that will ever be relevant, 
at least to future generations; 
the remainder of songs from the 
17 albums Cheap Trick produced 
are unremarkable, including the 
entirety of their latest album, 
Bang, Zoom, Crazy… Hello.

Released a week before their 

induction into the Rock and 
Roll Hall of Fame, the 11-track 
record isn’t bad. Compared to so 
much shit produced for the 2016 
mainstream radio, I would even 
dare to say that Bang, Zoom, 
Crazy… Hello is great. There are 
three solid standouts supported 
by a remainder of ’70s-esque 
noise fillers, but given the cur-
rent state of rock music, these 
three standouts are greatly 
appreciated.

“When I Wake Up Tomor-

row,” “Sing My Blues Away” 
and “Roll Me” are really all 
you need to listen to off Bang, 
Zoom, Crazy… Hello. Released 
as a single, “When I Wake Up 
Tomorrow” is the best song on 
the album and makes me under-
stand why Cheap Trick is being 
inducted into the Hall of Fame. 
Dubbed by Cheap Trick gui-
tarist Rick Nielsen as a moody, 
interesting piece reminiscent 
of a “sultry David Bowie song,” 
it’s evident that the band is still 
capable of churning out more 
than just noise. With smooth 
Bowie vocals, U2-esque key-
board 
interludes 
and 
their 

hallmark heavy guitar, “When 
I Wake Up Tomorrow” could 
easily be mistaken as a legend’s 
work.

With the bar set high by 

“When I Wake Up Tomorrow,” 
it’s no wonder that the rest of 

the album falls short. “Sing My 
Blues Away” and “Roll Me” are 
comparatively more memorable 
than the rest of the album in 
that they have that classic ’70s 
Cheap Trick vibe while being 
more than just guitar songs. 
“Sing My Blues Away” has a 
catchy upbeat chorus while 
“Roll Me” features more ang-
sty, sexy vocals, accompanied 
by equally ferocious guitar riffs. 
But that’s really all I can say 
because they both still sound 
so much like most Cheap Trick 
songs.

So then the question is why? 

Why is a Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame inductee’s latest work 
since 2009 average at best? It 
could be a function of who’s 
writing the music; guitarist Rick 
Nielsen does most of the song-
writing, so it makes sense that, 
as a guitarist, he writes most of 
the music for the guitar. That’s 
not necessarily a bad thing, 
because who doesn’t love a great 
guitar riff? But the problem is 
that those really great guitar 
riffs seldom appear. The same 
overbearing riffs dominate most 
of Cheap Trick’s songs, leaving 
little room for other instrumen-
tal or vocal creativity.

The homogeneity of Cheap 

Trick’s music then calls into 
question the inevitable — do 
bands have an expiration date? 
This is a tricky and touchy sub-
ject, one that I won’t even dare 
to touch right now. For the 
time being, let’s just enjoy the 
wonderfully different “When I 
Wake Up Tomorrow” and stick 
to the classics — after all, “Sur-
render” and “I Want You To 
Want Me” are probably the sole 
reason for Cheap Trick’s Rock 
and Roll Hall of Fame induction 
in the first place.

VIDEO GAME REVIEW
‘Primal’ reawakens 
‘Far Cry’ once again

By JACOB RICH

Senior Arts Edior

“Addicting” is one of the 

stranger adjectives used by game 
critics. In almost every context, 
addiction 
has 

an 
extremely 

negative 
con-

notation. 
Describing 
a 
friend 
as 

“addicted” 
usually signi-
fies that they 
need someone 
to step in and 
help them with 
a life problem. 
It’s not even always positive in 
the context of games — it can be 
especially nasty when consider-
ing the gross ways mobile app 
developers scheme to keep cus-
tomers playing and purchasing 
microtransactions.

However, Ubisoft’s “Far Cry” 

franchise has always repre-
sented a more positive form of 
addiction to me. As players prog-
ress through a “Far Cry” game’s 
narrative and explores its dan-
gerous, expansive open worlds, 
they also progress in ability — 
constantly upgrading weapons, 
unlocking new areas to explore 
(upgrading traversal capabili-
ties) and finding new crafting 
materials to upgrade equipment.

If you really want to be reduc-

tive about it, all this upgrading 
can simply represent numbers 
going up incrementally. But this 
constant, expertly crafted feel-
ing that you’re just a bit stronger 
— a bit more agile — a bit further 
in the story — results in one of 
the most engaging power-fan-
tasy gameplay systems in open-
world gaming.

“Far Cry Primal” certainly 

manages to nail that feeling of 
continual progression, but it isn’t 
just another one of these games. 
Like fellow spin-off entry “Far 
Cry: Blood Dragon,” “Primal” 
radically alters the game’s set-

ting, whisking the player from 
the 
contemporary 
war-torn 

landscapes of “3” and “4” into 
Central Europe’s stone age. This 
risk-taking, unconventional set-
ting allows “Primal” to be a huge 
improvement over its predeces-
sor (the bloated, overlong “Far 
Cry 4”), returning to a design 
closer to the leaner, meaner “Far 
Cry 3”

Easily one of the best-looking 

and best-running games on PS4, 
“Primal” ’s natural landscapes 
of rivers, old-growth forests and 
mountains are heart-stoppingly 
beautiful, as are the slightly 
exaggerated lighting techniques 
used to give the world distinct 
periods of day and night. The art 
design of “Primal” takes the idea 
of the caveman/woman as tradi-
tionally depicted and injects its 
classic “Far Cry” brand of vio-
lence. Even though upgradeable 
clubs, bows and spears replace 
a huge arsenal of guns, this is 
definitely no less gory. Toss-
ing a spear through an enemy 
caveperson’s brain is something 
you’ll do again and again in this 
game, and it never gets old. My 
roommate and I couldn’t stop 
laughing whenever I would nail 
a bad guy with a well-placed 
spear or arrow from across the 
screen. It’s one of the most glee-
ful melee combat experiences 
I’ve had with a game.

That being said, where previ-

ous “Far Cry” games thematical-
ly concerned bloodlust, insanity 
and nihilism, this one imbues its 
characters with a deep spiritu-
ality — a forgotten religion that 
dictates the way they speak and 

hunt. It’s a breath of fresh air in a 
franchise on the verge of feeling 
a little Hot Topic-brand angsty.

Even though I’m a devout 

real-life vegetarian, I’ve really 
enjoyed Far Cry’s traditionally 
over-the-top hunting sidequests 
— missions where the player 
hunts down huge, deadly ani-
mals for valuable skins used for 
item upgrades. “Primal” adds a 
brilliant new mechanic to these 
missions that had begun to feel 
slightly tired in “4.” In “Primal,” 
the player has the ability to 
tame and ride these dangerous 
animals. It’s brilliant, and I’m 
shocked they’ve never done it 
before — each animal ally comes 
packed with its own abilities for 
passive exploration and combat. 
They always feel like an asset, 
never a hassle. This mechanic is 
a blast to mess around with.

One thing critics have failed 

to comment on so far is “Primal” 
’s superior sound design. The 
game’s introduction, which uses 
only audio and a black screen to 
establish its setting in a way I 
won’t spoil, is the highlight of an 
all-in-all masterful implementa-
tion of sound mixing and unfor-
gettable effects.

The game’s narrative is noth-

ing to write home about — the 
franchise has still struggled to 
find a good central villain since 
“Far Cry 3” ’s Vaas (Michael 
Mando, “Better Call Saul”). 
But this series has always been 
about aesthetic, setting and 
that sweet sense of progression 
over anything else. And in those 
ways, “Far Cry Primal” suc-
ceeds in grand fashion. It’s dif-
ferent enough to be refreshing 
and familiar enough to hit those 
same endorphins in the back of 
your brain that made “Far Cry 3” 
so fun to play. It’s so cool to see a 
major studio continue to take big 
risks with a big franchise and 
have it pay off swimmingly.

Toronto group 

struggles to step out 
of Drake’s shadow

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

“Fuck with me now.”
The opening line on Sept. 

5th, R&B artist and OVO signee 
dvsn’s debut 
album, might 
seem like a 
classic brag-
gadocio rap 
lyric on paper. 
It could evoke 
the image of 
a gangster 
sitting atop 
a throne or Al Pacino lean-
ing behind a cocaine-covered 
desk — the kind of images OVO 
king Drake has been calling up 
increasingly often as of late. 
But dvsn has no such pretenses. 
It’s a plea, not a demand, to the 
woman he’s singing to. That 
kind of separation between sur-
face association and reality is at 
the heart of this release.

Much of this has to do with 

the style of music dvsn floats 
around in, that ever broaden-
ing space which marries hip 
hop, electronic, pop and R&B 
— what some have come to 
pejoratively term “PBR&B” 
(after the hipster’s favorite 
beer). It’s characterized by 
late night slow jams, stripper 
love and minimalistic, spa-
cious production. It’s doubtless 

that dvsn owes much to this 
Toronto-influenced wave. The 
group’s producer, Nineteen85, 
engineered some of the key-
stone singles in that field (think 
“Hold On, We’re Going Home” 
and “Truffle Butter”). However, 
it distinguishes itself from the 
swath of midnight acts trying 
to ride that wave by its trajec-
tory. Where the majority of 
reductive PBR&B comes from 
rappers entering the R&B field, 
dvsn moves in the opposite 
direction as an R&B group fore-
most, meeting the influence of 
hip hop and pop secondarily.

The result is a modern R&B 

album that exists as a tightrope 
between inspirations. There’s 
indie-rock, which manifests 
itself most clearly on “Angela,” 
built from indie artist Elliot 
Smith’s “Angeles,” with a jazz 
aesthetic brought in for good 
measure. “Do It Well” sounds 
like a more nuanced and tra-
ditional R&B take on Drake’s 
“Houstatlantavegas.” Title 
track “Sept. 5th” is a soul-
ful and far more optimistic 
reworking of House of Balloons-
era The Weeknd. Dvsn’s skill 
lies in the group’s ability to 
avoid redundancy in light of 
this broad lineage.

The clearest example of 

this is the single “Hallucina-
tions.” The track is a direct 
affront to claims that this kind 
of slow, syrupy sound has lost 
its freshness. The production 
echoes relentlessly, twirling 
through the air and grabbing 

your attention immediately. 
The singer, whose identity 
is still a mystery, meets that 
atmosphere with an equally 
enthralling croon, sounding 
reluctant when he admits “I’m 
losing sleep every night.” Who-
ever this vocalist is (I speculate 
it’s Daniel Daley), he has a 
powerful talent for controlling 
acute changes in his voice to 
achieve a commendable emo-
tional range, something that 
separates the group from art-
ists like PARTYNEXTDOOR 
and JMSN, who can fall into 
monotony and often rely far too 
heavily on their production.

Still, there are moments 

when Sept. 5th enters the for-
gettable. “Another One” feels 
like just that: another one. 
Among the tightrope of inspira-
tions here, it offers an example 
of when dvsn can teeter on the 
edge of average, particularly 
in the shadow of standouts like 
“With Me,” “Try / Effortless” 
and “Hallucinations.”

Some have derided dvsn for 

living in the shadow of Drake 
and other such PBR&B titans — 
now more than ever as an OVO 
signee. Where the tide started 
at Kanye’s 808s and Heartbreak 
and swelled to a too-big-to-fail 
mentality, it’s become easy to 
shrug off many of its benefac-
tors as fair-weather artists. But 
that criticism misses the point 
— for all its influences, dvsn 
can still inhabit its own world, 
even if just barely. On Sept. 5th, 
it works.

dvsn debuts with 
decently hip R&B

ALBUM REVIEW
Yeasayer album will 
convert the naysayers

By SHIMA SADAGHIYANI

Daily Arts Writer

Do you often turn to one of 

Salvador Dalí’s pieces and wish 
that a musical representation 
of 
what 
you 

are looking at 
exists? Are you 
tired of main-
stream 
pop 

hits 
because 

of their hum-
drum 
quali-

ties? Do you 
constantly 
search 
for 

music videos that straddle the 
line between artistic genius 
and really fucked up? If you 
answered yes to any of these 
questions, then Yeasayer’s new 
album, Amen & Goodbye, should 
be first on your list of albums to 
listen to. 

Even if you hate Dalí or pre-

fer your music videos on the 
tamer side, Amen & Goodbye 
still needs to be queued up on 
Spotify, because it does what 
many albums cannot do well: 
combine aspects of surrealism 
and music to create a dynamic, 
surreal, cohesive story that traps 
the listener from the first song 
and doesn’t let them go until the 
last. With synthetic pop sounds 
blending with lead singer Chris 
Keating’s mellow vocals, Amen 
& Goodbye is more than just an 
album; it’s a work of art.

The 
album 
begins 
with 

“Daughters of Cain.” Slow and 
intense, this track serves as the 
amuse-bouche of Amen & Good-
bye as well as the exposition. 
Masterfully blending folk and 
electronic, this song gives lis-
teners a hint of what’s to come 
throughout the rest of album 
while also maintaining a quiet 
power beneath the simple tune. 
It’s an introduction that doesn’t 
overwhelm but instead inspires; 
“Daughters of Cain” serves as a 
blank canvas that lets the listen-
ers go wild imagining all the dif-
ferent possibilities that could be 
splattered on such a vulnerable 
surface.

Yeasayer doesn’t disappoint. 

“Daughters of Cain” smoothly 
transitions into “I Am Chem-

istry.” Vibrant, futuristic and 
powerful, this song is 50 shades 
of badass. And even though the 
song is a little over five min-
utes, the listener never once 
loses interest. A combination of 
attention-grabbing lyrics (“she 
doesn’t need my help poising 
the well beneath the rue leaves 
/ she only needs my help plea-
suring herself beneath the rue 
leaves”) and Yeasayer’s ability to 
piece together different rhythms 
and sounds without being all 
over the place helps create the 
Jackson Pollock-esque musical 
powerhouse that is “I Am Chem-
istry.” 

The fun doesn’t stop there. 

With tracks like “Silly Me” and 
“Dead Sea Scrolls,” Yeasayer 
keeps people on their toes by 
continuing to push their sound 
higher and higher. “Silly Me” 
is everything the title suggests, 
with a fun, pop-punk beat mak-
ing the song glossy along with 
an added layer of electronica. 
“Dead Sea Scrolls” takes that 
electronica and drives it one step 
further by adding more depth to 
the one-dimensional, noncom-
mittal sound found in “Silly Me.” 
Chris Keating’s deeply melodi-
ous vocals in “a mock up of the 
dead / a mock up of the Dead Sea 
Scrolls” helps to make this song 
a real three-dimensional pres-
ence. 

From “I Am Chemistry” to 

“Dead Sea Scrolls,” Yeasayer 
consistently throws paint upon 
the blank canvas that “Daughters 
of Cain” introduced. Continuing 
to build and build, these space 
age, ultramodern and extremely 
formidable songs develop off 
each other until they reach the 
climax at the ending five seconds 
of “Dead Sea Scrolls.” The music 
just hits the edge between con-
centrated and overpowering and 

the noise level unceasingly rises 
and rises until, suddenly, every-
thing flattens out into the tran-
quil “Prophecy Gun.”

“Prophecy Gun” marks a shift 

in Amen & Goodbye. Its muted 
and organic sound mimics the 
quiet beauty of a soothing forest 
rather than a grandiose, high-
tech landscape, and thus it’s a 
complete contrast from the first 
half of the album. However, this 
change isn’t off-putting. Instead, 
“Prophecy Gun” is a much-
needed break from the action, 
providing the perfect bridge to 
smoothly transition into the rest 
of the songs of Amen & Goodbye. 
While the songs before “Proph-
ecy Gun” were exultant and 
avant-garde, the songs that come 
after “Prophecy Gun” seem to 
have taken a turn into the shad-
ows, with every track unfathom-
able and slightly dark. 

For example, “Divine Simula-

crum” is rain clouds personified, 
with “there’s heaven in the sea, 
driftwood in the sand / tell him 
to go to hell, and take me by the 
hand” over a morose and daunt-
ing beat. Both “Gerson’s Whis-
tle” and “Uma” feature moments 
of vulnerability and loneliness 
as Christ Keating’s vocals soar 
out over a minimal background. 
If songs pre-“Prophecy Gun” 
were Yeasayer slinging paint 
at a blank surface just to create 
something, these songs post-
“Prophecy Gun” are Yeasayer 
coming in and shaping the fine 
details with a paintbrush. The 
songs are intricately personal, 
satisfying in their intimacy and 
comforting in their simplicity.

Amen & Goodbye ends with 

the title track, which features no 
vocals and no clashing rhythms 
or stimulating beats, but instead 
one simple tune that signals the 
closing of the album. “Amen 
& Goodbye” is an open-ended 
question, a suggestion for the 
listeners to finish the story Yea-
sayer started in the way they 
prefer. A story that is one part 
revolutionary, one part despair-
ing and all parts captivating, 
beautifully meshed together into 
a brilliantly weird work of art 
that deserves its own place in 
the MoMA.

“

Well at one time, I was 
saying that their legacy 
hopefully wouldn’t go 

down as the greatest story 
never told… But we’re about to 
tell it.”

The 

quote comes 
from T-Mo, 
member 
of Atlanta 
rap group 
Goodie 
Mob, and 
the legacy 
in reference 
belongs to 
none other 
than Organized Noize. “The 
Art of Organized Noize,” docu-
mentary about the group, hit 
Netflix a couple weeks ago, 
and it takes viewers all the way 
back, more than just “a couple 
of years ago, to Headland and 
Delowe.” This is the same 
Headland and Delowe that was 
“the start of something good,” 
as told by Andre 3000 on 
“Elevators.” In the line, Dre is 
recalling the day he and Big Boi 
met up with Rico Wade, head 
honcho of Organized, outside 
of a hair salon and impressed 
him with their rhymes. Need-
less to say, Rico was a fan. He 
brought them back to the dun-
geon – his mother’s basement 
— and they kind of never left.

Well, Big Boi would leave for 

school in the mornings (3.68 
GPA students can’t miss class, 
even if it means having to forgo 
hearing some magic from Ray 
Murray — the sonic genius 
behind Organized’s produc-

tion), but Dre dropped out and 
stayed around. Beatrice, Rico’s 
mother, is featured in the 
doc and talks about growing 
immune to the music; it would 
be the first thing heard in the 
morning, still going strong late 
into the night. After a while, it 
wasn’t a bother. It just was.

Beatrice’s feature is just one 

sign of how personal the doc 
gets — a must-see for heads 
who wait around wondering 
when their favorite artists who 
contributed so much to the 
game will finally be displayed 
in a more accessible manner, 
for all to appreciate. Its candor 
is its strong suit, making the 
doc just as endearing as it is 
informative — the story behind 
“Player’s Ball,” for example, 
stands out — Outkast’s first 
single was actually the product 
of a request from their soon-to-
be label to contribute a track to 
“A LaFace Family Christmas.” 
Yup, a Christmas album. So 
Dre and Big Boi rapped about 
the only Christmas they knew, 
and with it, burst onto the 
scene.

With the debut of Southern-

playalisticadillacmuzik shortly 
thereafter, they felt like they 
made it. And by they, I mean 
the entire Dungeon Family. 
Cee-Lo reminisced on the first 
time he heard “Player’s Ball” 
on the radio. It was while he 
was at work at the airport. He 
quit immediately after. South-
ernplayalisticadillacmuzik was 
everyone’s first album, not just 
Outkast’s: It included verses 
from members of Goodie Mob, 

production, start to end, from 
Organized and creative input 
from all. They knew they were 
going to make it big — getting 
onto the scene was just the 
tough part.

Organized would go on 

to produce some of the most 
important hits of our time; 
they’re the masterminds 
behind TLC’s “Waterfalls.” But 
no matter whom they worked 
with, be it Bubba Sparxxx or 
Ludacris, they stayed true to 
their roots, mixing futuristic 
funk with live instrumenta-
tion — their signature sound 
that heavily influenced future 
production conglomerates like 
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League. This is 
to say, Organized remained 
unapologetically southern 
through it all. And though get-
ting onto the scene was tough 
in general when Southernplay-
alisticadillacmuzik debuted, 
this went twofold if you were 
from the South — the often 
neglected and still disrespect-
ed segment of the States.

Things have changed — sort 

of. We currently live in an 
interesting time where the 
tracks that receive plaques, and 
often the dances that accom-
pany them, come from art-
ists who aren’t even from the 
South, yet they’re applying the 
same formula understood as 
birthed by the third coast. Case 
in point: O.T. Genasis — of hits 
“CoCo” and “Cut It” — grew up 
in Long Beach, California, but 
one could make the claim that 
his sound is derivative of T.I.’s 
trap long before affiliating it 

The South’s got 
something to say

LEJLA 
BAJGORIC

HIP-HOP COLUMN

with, say, Warren G’s g-funk. 
And though neither trap nor 
g-funk captures the creative 
range of either coast alone, both 
subgenres can trace their ori-
gins to one of the two spaces.

The implication is that if you 

want mainstream level success, 
it’s now imperative to sound 
Southern (only regarding song 
structure though, we — or the 
radio — still don’t want local 
references or a country twang). 
There are two points to clarify 
here: One — is this really the 
case, is this sound “Southern?” 
And two — if so, is this a good 
thing, as it puts the South on 
the map as the sonic norm?

First off, the sound of any 

locale, not just the Dirty, is 
dynamic, fluid and always up 
for debate. Being designated as 
grittier than the rest, a la New 
York for example, surely has an 
effect on up-and-coming art-
ists from the East Coast as they 
develop their sound — a self-
fulfilling prophecy if you will. 

And while a cadre of Southern 
crews do fit the formula (ampli-
fy the energy and braggadocio 
on party cut beats while chill-
ing out on the complexity of 
the lyrics) like the Ying Yang 
Twins, Big Tymers and Three 6 
Mafia to name a few, we quickly 
run into some roadblocks that 
prevent us from agreeing with 
the first claim — that the pre-
dominant sound of rap is the 
sound of the South.

Geto Boys immediately come 

to mind: one of the primary 
pioneers in incorporating the 
South into the conversation 
about hip hop. Hailing from 
Houston, the trio (though at 
one point there were many 
more than three, as even Sir 
Rap-A-Lot was included) not 
only proved the South could rap 
along with New York’s finest, 
but also developed a new sub 
genre of rap in and of itself. You 
didn’t think Eminem was the 
first to stuff his lyrics full of 
shock value, often tied to horri-
fying, even homicidal, imagery 
— right? But before we write 
them off as some misogynists 
who “condoned” mass murder, 
it’s important to also bring up 
their introspection.

“I sit alone in my four-cor-

nered room staring at candles.”

The line initially comes from 

“Mind of a Lunatic,” about as 
horrendous as horrorcore gets, 
but it was cemented into the 
canon of hip hop’s greatest with 
1991’s “Mind Playing Tricks On 
Me.” The song made it clear 
that there was a range to the 
South’s darkness. Geto Boys 
were balanced; they spent a lot 
of time soul searching, won-
dering about the roots of their 
violence and the role of crooked 
cops in it all. They made their 
paranoia come to life for listen-
ers and gave a well-rounded 
sample of what coming up in 
the hoods of the South was like.

The Geto Boys make tangible 

the claim that the South can 
rap. But still, what about Big 
Tymers and Three 6 Mafia and, 
while we’re at it, even UGK – 
especially Pimp C? Most of that 
is, dare I say it, pretty straight-
forward:

“Smokin out, pourin up, put-

ting dick up in yo’ slut.”

There’s more than enough 

to be decoded, since much of 
the language and terminology 
used by the artists is distinctly 
Southern: Mike Jones has a fea-
ture on the same track and raps, 
“Candy paint what I’m flippin 
on, 84’s and vogues what I’m 
tippin on.” With no attempt to 
gain acceptance by the East or 
West in songs like these, South-
ern artists felt the South was 
a valid enough audience itself. 
And so they rapped specifically 
for them. And there was no 
need to get multisyllabic with 
the rhymes or obfuscate the 
metaphors to the point of cryp-
tic confusion. So while songs 
were coded, the lyrics often-
times weren’t exactly deep. 
However, the South did show 
up and show out every time — in 

a different way — and this goes 
for Big Tymers too.

Bun B too has a verse in 

“Pourin Up” as well and raps, 
“You outta ya league / Tryna 
keep up wit the trill, you just 
might die of fatigue / You can’t 
carry the load, you can’t carry 
the weight / Not like them boys 
up out that Lone Star state.”

To put on properly for the 

Lone Star State, as Bun implies, 
didn’t necessitate elite lyrical 
prowess. To be impressive was, 
and still is, to be musical — in 
production, in flow, in deliv-
ery. Many people prefer the 
sounds of the South because 
they’re consistently euphoni-
ous: the melody, the harmony, 
the hooks. It’s not just easier 
to listen to lyrically, but usu-
ally sweeter to the ear as well. 
There’s an element of soul — 
whether imposed through Cur-
tis Mayfield samples or created 
through independent interpola-
tion — that is just as important 
to discuss. If we’re going to dog 
on the South for vapid, airy lyr-
ics, then it’s only fair to pick on 
the East for cut-and-dried, for-
mulaic beats. Both statements 
are generalizations, but both 
aspects are just as important to 
rap as the other. It’s about the 
full package. After all, Outkast 
aren’t the beloved darlings of 
hip hop due to lyrics alone. 
Much of their success and 
standing is due to sound, i.e. is 
due to Organized Noize.

So when we talk about Big 

Tymers or Triple 6 as compared 
to the radio-friendly hits of 
today, there are similarities, but 
there’s also a big difference. The 
emphasis on hooks and resem-
blance in song structure holds 
(a generalization easily disman-
tled through groups like Geto 
Boys, Outkast and so on). But 
you already know what the next 
radio hit will sound like before 
it’s here. To call the redundant, 
recycled, soulless and unin-
spiring sound of today’s main-
stream “Southern” is to insult a 
space that is more moving in its 
musicality than even the mecca 
that is New York. Am I imply-
ing that mass production and 
capitalism have sucked the soul 
out of rap? Maybe — look out for 
the next piece to find out. But 
more important than all else is 
that we give the South its due 
props for its innovation and 
introspection.

When Outkast was booed 

at the 1995 Source Awards 
upon winning Best New Rap 
Group, Andre got on stage and 
let everyone know, “it’s like 
this: The South got something 
to say.” It’s about time they 
stopped being dismissed and 
started being taken seriously 
and praised for their contribu-
tions — which is to say, time 
they started being heard, words 
slurred, coming out through 
the diamonds in their mouths 
and all.

LaVall Jordan has worked on John Beilein’s coaching staff for the past six years.

Reports: Jordan 
off to Milwaukee

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan men’s basketball 

team’s coaching staff will officially 
need a new face next season, as 
assistant coach LaVall Jordan has 
accepted the head coaching job at 
Milwaukee, according to ESPN’s 
Jeff Goodman and CBS Sports’ 
Jon Rothstein.

Jordan, 
36, 
has 
been 
an 

assistant on John Beilein’s staff for 
the past six seasons, during which 
the Wolverines have gone 143-
70, made the NCAA Tournament 
five times and won two Big Ten 
titles. He, Bacari Alexander and 
Jeff Meyer have each remained 
with Beilein during that time, 
but Beilein said Wednesday a 
departure was possible.

This isn’t the first time Jordan 

has been up for another job. He was 
rumored for the head coaching job 
at Butler — his alma mater — when 
it opened two years ago. With 

the rise of the Michigan men’s 
basketball program during his 
tenure, Jordan has become known 
for his mentorship of breakout 
guards such as Trey Burke, now 
with the NBA’s Utah Jazz.

Milwaukee 
finished 
20-13 

(10-8 in the Horizon League) 
this past season and lost in the 
Horizon League quarterfinals to 
Green Bay.

Jordan’s departure might not 

be the only one from Beilein’s 
staff, as Alexander is among the 
rumored candidates for the head 
coaching vacancy at Detroit. He 
played for the Titans during the 
1997-98 and 1998-99 seasons after 
transferring from Robert Morris.

“I think that this is long 

overdue,” Beilein said Wednesday 
about the prospect of assistant-
coach attrition. “They are really 
ready to be (head) coaches. The 
fact that we’ve been together for 
six years — that doesn’t happen 
very often.”

Michigan set for Gophers

By COLE ZINGAS 

Daily Sports Writer

Right away, Harrison Wenson 

made it known that he was going 
to bring power to the middle of 
the Michigan 
baseball 
team’s lineup. 
He hit four out 
of Michigan’s 
first six home 
runs to start 
the season and 
is maintaining 
a .606 slugging 
percentage.

But as for 

the rest of the 
team, 
home 

runs 
have 

been 
hard 

to 
come 
by. 

Heading into 
conference 
play last weekend, junior first 
baseman Carmen Benedetti, the 
No. 3 hitter for the Wolverines, 
had only hit one. The only other 
player on the team with a homer 
was sophomore first baseman 
Drew Lugbauer — and his came 
on a line drive inside-the-parker.

In fact, for a team that has 

climbed to a 21-6 record and 
garnered enough attention to 
earn a spot in all five major top-
25 polls this week, the power 
numbers were shockingly low. 
The Wolverines were tied for 
254th out of 300 teams in the 
country in home runs and 11th in 
the Big Ten.

But last Friday, the Wolverines 

began to show signs of big-swing 
potential. That day, fifth-year 
senior outfielder Matt Ramsay 
belted three dingers in one game. 
Michael Brdar added to that 
trend with a long bomb on a large 
field at Notre Dame. 

The Wolverines have been 

racking up runs — they have 
scored five runs or more in each 
of their last 10 games — but only 

recently has the team started to 
put a few over the fence.

“We trust that if our power 

guys are doing a good job with 
their approach and only swinging 
at pitches that they can drive … 
then the power numbers will 
take care of themselves,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich.

One of those “power guys” 

to whom Bakich is referring is 
Lugbauer, who is in the midst of 
a breakout campaign.

Lugbauer, 
who 
stands 
at 

6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, has 
been hitting balls hard since 
his 
freshman 
season. 
But 

unfortunately for him, many 
would-be doubles and triples 
went right at opposing fielders, 
which resulted in a disappointing 
.211 batting average in 2015. 

In the last week, however, it 

has looked as if Lugbauer can be 
a guy to step up and supply some 
muscle for the Wolverines.

Tuesday against the Irish, he 

hit a two-run triple that Bakich 
said would’ve cleared the fence 
at Ray Fisher Stadium. When 
the Wolverines returned home 
the following day, Lugbauer 
seized the opportunity and hit 
two home runs — both well over 
the right-field fence. A third 
ball he hit, this time to right-
center, had a shot to clear as 
well, but a leaping catch at the 
wall denied him the chance to 
match Ramsay’s three-homer 
performance from a week ago.

But 
neither 
Bakich 
nor 

Lugbauer seemed to be at all 
surprised by the lefty’s big day 

against Bowling Green.

“It’s kind of awesome … I 

guess I’ll take it,” Lugbauer 
said with a shrug about his 
performance on Wednesday.

Lugbauer is not the only 

one who has been heating up. 
Benedetti, 
a 
preseason 
All-

American, 
has 
batted 
at 
a 

consistent 
.344 
average 
and 

gotten on base in 50 percent of 
his plate appearances. Despite 
hitting only one home run so far 
this season, Benedetti is a big 
hitter with a capability to change 
a game with one swing.

“We’re going to keep doing 

what 
we’re 
doing, 
because 

it’s working,” Lugbauer said. 
“Home runs come, and if we 
keep swinging the bats and 
hitting the ball hard, good 
things will happen.”

Though Michigan has won 10 

of its last 11 games, the wins all 
came against teams with losing 
records. In the last two weeks, 
the Wolverines have swept UIC 
(11-16) and Northwestern (7-22), 
and rattled off single-game wins 
against Central Michigan (5-23) 
and Bowling Green (11-18).

Michigan 
asserted 
its 

dominance 
and 
looked 

impressive in each of these 
contests, but against a 15-11 Notre 
Dame team, the Wolverines had 
a chance to earn a quality win 
against a legitimate Atlantic 
Coast 
Conference 
contender. 

Instead, they fell, 9-5.

Their 
upcoming 
schedule 

won’t be as forgiving. This 
weekend, 
Michigan 
plays 

Minnesota (16-10) — which has 
won six of its last eight and won 
its first Big Ten series of the year 
against Iowa. 

With conference play starting 

to heat up, the Wolverines could 
use an extra boost. If the hard 
swings 
continue, 
Michigan 

believes that eventually, the balls 
will carry, and a surging offense 
could provide just that.

WOMEN’S LACROSSE
‘M’ loses blowout

By KATIE CONKLIN 

Daily Sports Writer

With seven national titles, the 

No. 13 Northwestern women’s 
lacrosse team instills fear in the 
minds of its 
opponents. 
The 
team emphasizes strength and 
aggression, as evidenced by its 
high-pressure 
defense 
in 
all 

thirds of the field.

By sending a double team 

toward the ball handler, the 
Wildcats hope to fluster their 
opponents into making a mistake. 
Though 
an 
attacker 
is 
left 

unmarked, the double typically 
makes it extremely difficult for 
the ball handler to drive or get 
off a clean pass. In the first half 
of play against Michigan on 
Thursday night, Northwestern’s 
plan worked seamlessly.

Forty minutes into the game, 

Michigan junior attacker Tess 
Korten was stuck in one of the 
double teams. Searching for the 
open player, Korten spotted junior 
attacker Jess Angerman, who was 
wide open at the left of the crease. 
Korten passed to Angerman, who 
then rounded the crease, faked 
the goalie and hit twine, resulting 
in Michigan’s first score.

Unfortunately 
for 
the 

Wolverines, they still had 16 goals 
left to tie the game.

Michigan 
coach 
Jennifer 

Ulehla predicted Northwestern’s 
pressure from the start. Coming 
off of two consecutive losses, 
the Wildcats were looking for 
redemption, and they earned it 
with an early 17-1 lead.

“We have to weather the storm 

in the beginning of this game 
because they’re going to come out 
on fire,” Uhlela said to the team 
before the game. “It’s going to be 
high pressure, and we’ve got to 
be able to handle that and think 
clearly and work through it.”

Based on the 20-4 final score, 

it’s clear the warning didn’t bode 
well for the Wolverines.

“Well, the storm happened, 

and we obviously didn’t work 
through it,” Ulehla said.

Entering halftime without a 

single goal, Michigan pointed to 
its lack of aggression. The effort 
was there, but the execution 
was not.

“We had a mentality of ‘We 

need to get to goal,’ ” Angerman 
said. “We didn’t really have 
anything to lose. It all came down 
to possession time and being able 
to capitalize on our opportunities.”

There wasn’t much time to 

capitalize 
on 
opportunities, 

though, 
as 
Northwestern 

dominated the draw control, 19-6. 
Known for their draw specialists, 
the Wildcats know where the ball 
is going to be before the whistle 
is blown — something Michigan 
aspires to develop and something 
it just couldn’t beat.

“It’s the consistent execution 

of where the ball’s going,” Ulehla 
said. “They’re able to put (the ball) 
in a position that’s consistent, 
they know it’s going there and 
they’re able to run onto it.”

The Wolverines, who have run 

successful backer and man defenses 
in their short, three-season history 
had extreme difficulty in stopping 
Northwestern’s attack. It wasn’t 
until 
halftime 
that 
Michigan 

began to adjust.

“It took a while to figure out a 

defense that was going to work,” 
Ulehla said. “By the time we did, 
it was 15-0.”

Playing Northwestern twice 

last year, Michigan lost 17-8 in its 
first showing. After recharging 
for the Big Ten quarterfinal, the 
Wolverines lost just 13-9. With the 
potential of seeing the Wildcats 
again in the Big Ten Tournament 
this season, Michigan may have a 
chance to exact revenge.

“If 
we 
see 
Northwestern 

again,” Ulehla said. “I guarantee 
it’ll be a different outcome.”

Wolverines back on the road

By BETELHEM ASHAME 

Daily Sports Writer

Homer after homer flew out of 

the ballpark in Bloomington.

The No. 1 Michigan softball 

team 
had 

entered 
Hoosier 
territory 
and 
made 

its 
presence 

felt. 
By 
the 

end 
of 
last 

weekend, the 
Wolverines 
racked up an 
eye-popping 
nine 
home 

runs 
— 

including two 
grand 
slams, 

three two-run 
blasts and three solo shots.

Overpowering Indiana with 

the long ball, Michigan (5-1 Big 
Ten, 27-3 overall) swept the 
series in grand fashion with a 
31-9 combined run margin. But 
the Wolverines left Bloomington 
with more than a series sweep 

and the winningest coach in 
NCAA history.

After a thorough thrashing of 

the Hoosiers, Michigan has a new 
spot in the national rankings: the 
top. The Wolverines are ranked 
No. 1 for the first time since 2011.

According to Michigan coach 

Carol Hutchins, though, that 
won’t change anything.

“In 2011, we didn’t even make it 

to the super regionals,” Hutchins 
said. “So that’s how I feel about it. 
It’s all about getting to the end. 
We can only worry about the 
battles that we’re in, and we’re in 
a battle this weekend with a very 
tough Nebraska team. They’re 
always a tough opponent for us, 
so I quite frankly don’t give a 
damn about the ranking.

“Nobody knows who’s ranked 

in April.”

Going into a tough conference 

series against Nebraska (5-3, 
24-12) 
this 
weekend, 
the 

Wolverines will look to their 
leader and standout performer 
to help them keep the ball rolling 
against the Cornhuskers. Senior 
second baseman Sierra Romero 

set the tone in the series sweep 
against Indiana, tallying seven 
runs, six RBI and three home 
runs, one in each game, in a 7-for-
8 performance at the plate. 

Stepping up her game with 

the conference season underway, 
Romero earned Big Ten Player 
of the Week honors after her 
dominant performance.

“Since the start of Big Ten, 

which 
has 
only 
been 
two 

weekends now, I’ve been feeling 
pretty 
good,” 
Romero 
said. 

“I’ve just been focusing on my 
fundamentals, just really trying 
to get my bat out front, getting 
good pitches to hit and staying 
ahead of the count. So I’ve just 
been really focusing on little 
things. It just so happened that 
last weekend it all worked.”

As Romero has stepped up 

her play, her teammates have 
followed 
suit. 
Most 
notably, 

junior third baseman Lindsay 
Montemarano 
has 
continued 

her recent tear in the batter’s 
box. Blasting a triple and two 
home runs, including a grand 
slam, 
against 
the 
Hoosiers, 

Montemarano 
validated 
her 

recognition as Big Ten Co-Player 
of the Week last week.

Though Indiana has had a 

respectable season so far, it isn’t 
quite at the level of Michigan, 
as evidenced by the Wolverines’ 
convincing 
series 
sweep. 

Nebraska, however, will be a 
much more accurate benchmark 
for Michigan to determine its 
progression as a team.

The 
Cornhuskers 
dropped 

out of the top-25 poll with two 
losses at Illinois last weekend, 
but with two wins against ranked 
opponents, they shouldn’t be 
overlooked by the Wolverines. 
Infielder 
MJ 
Knighten, 
in 

particular, will be one to watch 
out for, as she has hit .407 with 17 
home runs to power their lineup.

“We’re in the middle of our 

season, and we just continue to 
evolve,” Hutchins said. “We’re 
going into the heart of the season, 
and we just need to stay focused 
on the things that we control, 
which is playing ball. ... The only 
thing I hope they do (is) play

The legend of Travis Wooley

Senior went from 
childhood in Brazil 
to cheerleading to 
Michigan football 

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Editor

ORLANDO, 
Fla. 
— 
Travis 

Wooley isn’t one to give up. 
Michigan 
cheerleading 
coach 

Pam St. John knew that as well as 
anyone, but she still needed the 
flag back.

The Michigan football team had 

just stomped all over Florida in the 
Jan. 1 Citrus Bowl, 41-7. At halftime, 
St. John had promised Wooley — a 
former cheerleader — that if the 
Wolverines won, he would be able 
to wave the flag around the field. 
Wooley had also requested to keep 
the flag after the game, but St. John 
thought he was joking.

He wasn’t. Wooley got an inch 

and took it a mile, running the flag 
back into the locker room with full 
intentions of keeping it.

St. John was far from the first 

person to dismiss one of Wooley’s 
sky-high ambitions, and like the 
thousands before her, she would 
end up eating her words.

There 
are 
many 
underdog 

stories in sports, but none like 
this. From growing up in Brazil 
to beginning organized football 
at 14 to being a benchwarmer on 
a winless high school team to 
majoring in musical theatre at 
Saginaw Valley State to joining 
the Michigan cheerleading team, 
not one part of Wooley’s journey 
indicated that he belonged on the 
Michigan football team.

But there he stood, with sweat-

soaked pads on his shoulders 
and a winged helmet in his hand, 
celebrating Michigan’s 10th win of 
the season.

He eventually gave the flag 

back, but that was a minor loss. 
His mystifying journey full of 
rejection, enthusiasm and one 
seized opportunity was complete.

In a story unlike any other, 

against all odds and criticism, 
Wooley had lettered with the 
Michigan football team.

* * *

Wooley’s 
introduction 
to 

football parallels that of a foreigner, 
and in many ways, he was.

Despite being born in Texas, 

Wooley spent his formative years 
in Brasilia, Brazil, as his father, 
John, served as a deputy attaché 
for Homeland Security and the 
U.S. Embassy. For the most part, 
Wooley grew up Brazilian, but U.S. 
government workers overseas are 
required to come to America one 
month out of the year on a program 
called “Home Leave” to stay in 
touch with and embrace American 
culture. In the Wooley family, that 
culture included football.

Though 
football 
was 
not 

offered in Brasilia, Wooley would 
watch “Friday Night Lights,” 
“Remember 
the 
Titans” 
and 

other sports movies religiously. 
He not only loved the intensity of 
football and its ability to bring a 
community together, but also its 
ability to make him feel less like 
an outsider in a foreign land.

“I was picked on a lot in Brazil, 

and I was in America so little that 
it felt like vacation to come here,” 
Wooley said. “So football gave me 
a chance to go back to the United 
States and feel normal. I was big 
for my age, so (the football players) 
were like gods 
to me.”

Eventually, 

he 
got 
the 

itch to play, 
but resources 
in 
Brazil 

were 
short. 

So before he 
moved 
back 

to the United 
States 
in 

2006, Wooley learned the game of 
football by playing NCAA Football 
video games, watching movies and 
reading 1950s playbooks found in 
his principal’s attic.

But Wooley’s mother, Shelley, 

knew her son would pick it 
up. In the same year, she had 
seen Travis — seen as too large 
and 
inexperienced 
to 
ride 

horses 
competitively 
— 
defy 

conventional wisdom and become 
a 
medal-winning 
endurance 

horse-racer in Brasilia through 
sheer will. A game he had actually 
practiced a little bit and was built 
for? No problem.

“When he came back to the 

U.S., these other kids had been 
playing for several years, but 
Travis 
didn’t 
blink,” 
Shelley 

said. “The best thing you can do 
if you want him to accomplish 
something is to first tell him no. 
… For as long as I can remember, 
he has been unwilling to hear the 
word ‘no.’ He will absolutely turn 
that no into a yes.”

When Travis was 14, the family 

moved back to America. Armed 
with little more than a love for 
the game, Wooley tried out for 
the eighth-grade football team. 
In many towns in America, he 
wouldn’t have gotten the shot. He 
would have been too old and too 
raw to join a competitive team.

But he wasn’t in one of those 

places. His father had become 
Homeland Security’s special agent 
in charge of Northern Michigan, 
and Wooley’s introduction to 
football came in tiny Sault Ste. 
Marie. In the 14,000-person, 
upper-peninsula town, Wooley 
would get a shot at football.

And that was all he needed.

* * *

Of all the people to be surprised 

when Travis Wooley made the 
Michigan football team, his high 
school coach considers himself 
among the most shocked. Scott 
Menard spent 10 years at the helm 
of Sault Area High School, and his 
worst two seasons were in the falls 
of 2009 and 2010 — Wooley’s two 
years on varsity.

His Blue Devils went 1-17 those 

two seasons, and the second player 
in school history to go on to play 
Division I football couldn’t even 
crack the starting lineup.

“I’ve got to be honest with you, 

he didn’t play a lot,” Menard said 
in a phone interview. “He was as 
raw as you’re going to get. … He 
was always a little behind.”

And it wasn’t as if the team 

was that far ahead. In a good year, 
Menard says his team might have 
a handful of Division II players on 
his roster. But neither year was a 

good year, and Travis was not even 
a starter.

When asked to size up Wooley’s 

abilities, Menard admitted his 
former player was hardly above 
average in anything. At 6-feet 

and 
around 

200 
pounds, 

Wooley never 
really 
found 

a position he 
could 
thrive 

in.

But 
it 

wasn’t for a 
lack of effort.

“What 

stood 
out 

to me, though, is that he wasn’t 
afraid to try anything,” Menard 
said. “When one guy was injured 
or another needed a breather, he 
would immediately come up to me 
and say, ‘Hey coach, I can go in, I 
think I can do that.’

“He wasn’t afraid to work for 

something if it helped the team or 
it helped him get better. Whatever 
opportunities came up, he would 
take them and seize them, or at 
least try to.”

Wooley’s 
enthusiasm 
and 

energy left him confident that 
he would be able to walk on to a 
football team in college, but the 
try-anything mantra applied off 
the field, too. Midway through high 
school, Wooley became a fan of the 
hit musical show “Glee.” With no 
prior experience, he auditioned 
for his high school’s production of 
the musical “Chicago” senior year 
and was cast in the lead role.

With natural charisma and 

enthusiasm, he fell in love with the 
performing arts. After seeing the 
YouTube hit movie “A Very Potter 
Musical” performed by University 
of Michigan students, Wooley 
fell in love with Michigan’s 
musical theatre program, too. 
While researching the University, 
he discovered the history and 
prestige of Michigan football.

His walk-on dream had a 

destination.

“As 
someone 
who 
moved 

around a lot as a kid and never 
had that many close friends, 
Michigan was a big draw to me 
— no matter what the program,” 
Wooley said. “People were just 
unapologetically supportive and 
appreciative of each other, and 
that was something I wanted to be 
a part of.”

Wooley 
was 
rejected 
by 

Michigan in the spring of 2011, his 
senior year.

He later called the moment 

a “tipping point” in his love for 
Michigan to prove the doubters 
wrong. Just as before, telling him 
no was all the encouragement he 
would need.

* * *

When 
asked 
about 
Travis 

Wooley, just about everyone will 
discuss Wooley’s enthusiasm. And 
that’s warranted — no one can go 
through a journey like his without 
enthusiasm, but where does it 
come from? No one is really born 
with enthusiasm, and it’s a hard 
trait to teach. To have a high level 
of enthusiasm, it must be bred into 
us as children.

Fortunately for Wooley, that’s 

exactly what happened. Even 
before his days fighting for the 
Navy in the Vietnam War, John 
Wooley believed that everything 
can be accomplished if the energy 
and passion is there. He entered 
federal law enforcement, pushing 
himself and his comrades to take 
on large-scale drug trafficking. 
He constantly told his three sons 
that every challenge served as an 
opportunity.

Even after he retired in 2012, his 

values stood tall. Travis Wooley 
remembers sitting in the car with 
his father as a radio talk show 
discussed automotive bailouts. By 
that point, Travis had settled on 
Saginaw Valley State, where he 
would studying musical theatre 
and training with the intentions of 
transferring to Michigan.

His 
grades 
struggled 
first 

semester, and even his revised 
plan looked bleak. But as the 
bailouts were discussed, John 
turned off the radio.

“He turned to me and said, 

‘When you get into Michigan, it’s 
going to feel so good knowing that 
you did it all by yourself,’ ” Wooley 
recalled. “That was one of the 
most memorable things anyone 
has ever said to me.”

And it stuck. Wooley increased 

his 
weightlifting 
regimen 

immediately. 
To 
improve 
his 

grades, Wooley cut out ice cream 
— his favorite food — until he got 
a 4.0 grade-point average.

He never had ice cream (and 

still hasn’t to this day), but after 
two years at Saginaw, he got the 
next best thing: admittance to 
Michigan.

For the first time, Wooley’s 

dream had some legs. But the 
already average football player 
hadn’t played in more than two 
years, and the Wolverines don’t 
tend to take those kinds of players, 
so Wooley needed to find a way to 
get his foot in the door.

He only needed an inch.

* * *

In the real world, the majority of 

career advancement results come 
from networking and connections 
made along the way. Whether it’s 
a friend, colleague or even just a 
fellow alumnus, jobs are given in 
large part based on who you know.

Wooley remembered this very 

thought when he tried out for the 
Michigan cheerleading team in 
the fall of 2013. The football team 
wouldn’t take him, so he tried to get 
as close to the program as possible.

“I wanted people to Google 

‘Michigan football’ and see my 
face,” Wooley said. “And with the 
cheerleading team, you can do that.”

That wasn’t the only benefit 

of the cheerleading team. As 
perennial 
contenders 
for 
the 

national championship, the team 
trains year-round as seriously 
as any varsity sport. They have 
access to special weight rooms 
along with several other facilities 
for student-athletes.

And perhaps most importantly 

for Wooley, no experience was 
required to join.

“We don’t have a lot of men go 

out for our team, and none of them 
come in with the skills for this 
sport,” St. John said. “So part of our 
vetting process is, are they a good 
person? Are they nice, are they 
enthusiastic, are they flexible?’

“We 
want 

them 
to 
be 

athletic 
and 

strong enough 
to perform the 
tasks we ask 
them to, but a 
large 
part 
of 

it is what kind 
of person you 
are, and it was 
apparent pretty 
early on that Travis had that.”

With plenty of enthusiasm and 

energy to his credit, Wooley was 
a natural fit. He cheered for two 
years, and the Wolverines took 
home the national title both years.

But Wooley wasn’t shy about 

what his end goal was. Once he 
arrived in Ann Arbor, he e-mailed 
the football team at least once 
a week for two years. He would 
get responses, but they usually 
mentioned an unspecified open 
tryout, until they said it was 
canceled or had already happened.

Undeterred, Wooley simply 

worked 
harder 
to 
ensure 

that when he finally did get a 
chance, he wouldn’t miss it. 
After 
cheerleading 
practice 

and lifting, Wooley would run 
sprints, go through agility drills 
and push himself to get into 
shape for when the football 
team came knocking.

“He worked harder than a 

lot of kids I’d ever seen,” said 
cheerleading 
co-captain 
Evan 

Hampton. “I just don’t think it was 
in his blood to take it easy.”

Off the field, he used his 

presence on the cheerleading 
team to join clubs for student-
athletes, where he met members 
of the football team. Players like 
wide receiver Jehu Chesson and 
defensive lineman Chris Wormley 
were drawn to his energy and 
fearless charisma right away, but 
when he brought up the fact that 
he was trying to make the team, 
they — like St. John with the flag 
— thought he was kidding.

“I didn’t think he was serious,” 

said Chesson, who met Wooley 
through 
student-athlete 
Bible 

study while Wooley was still on 
the cheer team. “Or even if he 
was, I didn’t think he would go 
through with it. A lot of guys talk 
and even think about trying out, 
but it’s another thing to actually 
do it. I didn’t think much of it at 
the time.”

Wooley wasn’t joking, though 

he did need to wait for a new head 
coach with equally unheard-of 
enthusiasm to take over.

* * *

When Jim Harbaugh returned 

to Ann Arbor to become the 
Michigan football coach, to say 
he was a popular guy would be an 
understatement.

Many people wanted to talk to 

him, but Wooley had something 
others 
didn’t 
— 
Harbaugh’s 

attention in the front row.

During a Michigan women’s 

basketball game in January 2015, 
Harbaugh was seated along the 
baseline of Crisler Center as 
Wooley performed a routine with 
the team. While Wooley held a 
female cheerleader over his head, 
Harbaugh — as has proven to be 
typical of the eccentric coach — 
began to coach Wooley on his form 
and muscle placement.

Despite the absurdity of the 

situation, Wooley knew he had the 
chance he was looking for.

“He’s bugging me during the 

routine, but I just go, ‘Hey coach, 
I’m looking forward to trying 
out for you next week,’ ” Wooley 

said. 
“Then 

mid-routine, he 
starts 
asking 

about 
my 

height, weight, 
40 time and so 
on.”

It 
was 

only 
a 
few 

minutes, 
and 

it was unclear 
if 
it 
actually 

helped his chances, but a week 
later, Wooley made it through 
tryouts and was invited to join the 
Michigan football team.

Four years and two schools 

since he last played a down of 
organized football, Wooley had 
realized his dream.

“We questioned it all the time,” 

Shelley said of the family’s doubts 
along the way. “The joke in our 
family was that the stars aligned 
for Travis — perfect time, perfect 
coach, perfect grades. … When he 
called to tell us he had made the 
team, he was just beside himself. 
It was a special moment.”

It was extra special for John, 

who had grown ill with cancer 
since reigniting Wooley’s dream 
three years prior. The elder 
Wooley told Travis he had never 
been prouder.

But for the younger Wooley, the 

journey was only just beginning.

* * *

Beyond simply the financial 

burden, life as a walk-on football 
player is substantially harder 

than that of a scholarship player. 
While Michigan has financially 
committed 
to 
its 
scholarship 

players, the walk-ons are owed 
nothing and are often seen as 
dispensable parts, complete with 
training regimens designed to 
make athletes quit.

But four years into the relentless 

pursuit of his dream, Wooley 
couldn’t even fathom quitting.

“Oh, God no,” Wooley said. 

“Somehow they gave me a shot, 
and then I just kind of stuck 
around. I truly believed that they 
were going to kick me off the team, 
that they were going to say, ‘You 
can’t help us, please leave.’ ”

But that loyalty also applied 

to the cheerleading team, which 
trains through the first week 
of April. Wooley had made a 
commitment to the team and 
maintained that commitment — 
no matter the cost.

“He was doing four-a-days, 

if you think about it,” said 
cheerleading 
co-captain 
Alex 

Snow. “But he got a whiff of his 
dream, and I think he loved it. … 
Being on the team, being a part 
of Michigan football, that’s all he 
ever wanted.”

Added St. John: “I could tell he 

was exhausted, but he was keeping 
his commitment to our team. I 
wish I could tap into that (energy). 
I could use a little bit of it.”

Working out for up to six hours 

per day for the month of March, 
Wooley tested the limits of his 
dream. He not only passed, but 
won over his new teammates in 
the process.

“I thought it was cool to see 

him really push through that 
month,” said Wormley, who met 
Wooley while the two lived in 
North Quad in 2013. “Travis isn’t 
the most athletically gifted kid 
when it comes to football, but 
his heart and determination and 
passion for Michigan as a whole 
is something I wish more of our 
players had.”

Added Chesson: “A lot of guys 

who are on the scout team are 
like, ‘Damn, I’m on the scout 
team’ and have a bad attitude 
about it. But that was never the 
case with him, ever.”

Most importantly, he made the 

dress list for the Spring Game on 
April 4, 2015. His father, who had 
grown more ill in the month since 
Wooley made the team and was 
using a walker, was able to make 
it to the game to see his son in 
uniform for the first time.

Wooley didn’t play, but it didn’t 

matter — he had made it.

Above all else, his father, who 

had a bone marrow transplant 
and had been in the hospital for 
a month, was able to see his son 
finally make it. Unable to walk on 
his own or withstand the cold, he 
got a box seat.

“He didn’t have to fight the 

lines,” Shelley joked. “He had 
blanket after blanket and hat 
after hat, but he got to see his 
son down on the sidelines in a 
Michigan uniform.

“It was really a dream come 

true.”

Neither 
John 
nor 
Travis 

Wooley took the moment for 
granted, and for good reason. 
John’s condition grew worse, and 
July 14, 2015, the man who taught 
Travis about football, enthusiasm 
and had reignited his dream when 
he needed it most passed away.
