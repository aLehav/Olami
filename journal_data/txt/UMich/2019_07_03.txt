Activists call for 
termination of 
Rick Snyder
on social media

Former 
Michigan 
Governor 
Rick Snyder has been awarded a 
senior research fellowship at the 
Taubman Center for State and 
Local Government, which operates 
under Harvard University’s John 
F. Kennedy School of Government, 
the school announced Friday. 
Snyder, a University of Michigan 
alum, will work with students, 
faculty and other fellows in the 
school’s Taubman Center for 
State 
and 
Local 
Government 
to research, write and teach, 
according to a press release from 
the Kennedy School. Snyder began 
his fellowship on Monday despite 
backlash over his appointment. 
In the release, Taubman Center 
director Jeffrey Liebman wrote 
he is confident Snyder will bring 
“tremendous value” to the school.
“Governor 
Snyder 
brings 
his 
significant 
expertise 
in 
management, public policy and 

promoting civility to Harvard 
Kennedy School,” Liebman said.
Snyder was quoted in the press 
release saying he was excited to 
spread his insight of government 
at the state level. 
“I look forward to sharing 
my experiences in helping take 
Michigan to national leadership 
in 
job 
creation, 
improved 
government 
performance, 
and 
civility,” Snyder said. 
The 
release 
cited 
Snyder’s 
leadership 
guiding 
Detroit 
through the “largest municipal 
bankruptcy in U.S. history,” as 
well as his support of autonomous 
vehicles, expansion of Michigan 
workforce and STEM training, 
investments in infrastructure and 
improvements to the finances and 
pension system. 
Snyder’s 
appointment 
has 
prompted 
backlash 
on 
social 
media by those who note his 
administration’s role in the Flint 
water crisis. 
Using 
#NoSnyderFellowship, 
the trending hashtag started by 
activist Mariame Kaba, activists 
on Twitter urged their followers 
to 
directly 
contact 
Liebman 
asking him to rescind Snyder’s 
fellowship. Readers were also 
advised to post about the issue, get 
Harvard alumni to support their 
cause and donate to Mari Copeny’s 
fundraising efforts for Flint. 

Those engaged in the social 
media 
effort 
include 
Piper 
Kerman, author of the book 
“Orange is the New Black,” which 
was the basis of Netflix’s show of 
the same name, and Copeny, also 
known as “Little Miss Flint.”
Abdul El-Sayed, the second-
place 2018 Michigan Democrat 
gubernatorial 
candidate, 
also 
questioned on Twitter why Snyder 
was 
awarded 
the 
fellowship. 
El-Sayed’s press team directed 
The Daily to Adam Joseph, a 
graduate of the Kennedy School 
and 
former 
communications 
director 
for 
El-Sayed’s 
gubernatorial campaign, when 
asked for comment.
On Sunday, Joseph tweeted 
Snyder’s fellowship appointment 
was “beyond astounding” and 
criticized the school’s decision. 
El-Sayed 
retweeted 
Joseph’s 
sentiments. 
University alum Hoai An Pham 
said she joined Kaba’s social media 
organizing by posting her own 
email to Liebman as a template 
for others. Having graduated from 
the University in the spring, Pham 
is still active in her collegiate 
organizing communities, and said 
she has seen success with email 
templates in the past.

City Council 
appoints new 
A2 police chief

Council selects 
Michael Cox for 
position at Monday 
night meeting

Ann Arbor City Council gathered 
Monday evening in Larcom City Hall. 
The meeting, which marked the start 
of a new fiscal year, was met with 
conversations regarding nonpartisan 
voting practices, housing development 
plans and approval of a new Ann Arbor 
Chief of Police.
Jane Lumm, I-Ward 2, introduced 
a resolution for the November ballot 
to add the option to convert local Ann 
Arbor elections to a nonpartisan system 
in which all candidates would run 
for two general election nominations 
regardless of party affiliation.
“Passing this tonight is to place the 
question on the ballot for voters to 
determine, but I do think there are 
very strong arguments for conducting 
local elections on a nonpartisan basis,” 
Lumm said.
Ann 
Arbor 
currently 
stands 
alongside Ypsilanti and Ionia as one 
of the state’s three cities which still 
participate in partisan local elections. 
Lumm, the only non-Democrat on the 
council and having previously served 
as a Republican, has been calling for a 
move away from partisan elections for 
almost four years.
Because the city of Ann Arbor and 
Washtenaw County as a whole is 
saturated with historically Democratic 
voters, 
Lumm 
said 
she 
believes 
the August primary elections are 
essentially the only competitive races. 
In November, when voter turnout 
is 
higher, 
Democrats 
often 
run 
unopposed. Rosemary Bogden, resident 
of Ann Arbor’s Ward 3, spoke to the 
council, compelling them to leave the 
issue to the voters.
“I think this could make for a much 
more fair, democratic, exciting and 
intelligent election,” Bogden said.

Alum discusses 
climate change

Tim Arvan 
examines 
negotiations on and
off campus

On Sunday night, Citizens’ 
Climate Lobby Ann Arbor and 
Washtenaw 
Climate 
Reality 
hosted an event titled “Climate 
Change Negotiation and Policy 
at Home and Abroad” with 
University of Michigan alum 
Tim Arvan at the Ann Arbor 
District 
Library’s 
Westgate 
branch. 
Arvan 
attended 
the 
United Nations COP24 Climate 
Change Convention in Katowice, 
Poland as a Climate Blue student 
delegate. 
He started the talk by recalling 
his time in Katowice. He said that 
while he did not take part in any 
of the negotiations, his presence 
showed the United Nations’ 
commitment 
to 
exhibiting 

transparency 
in 
its 
climate 
negotiations. Additionally, he 
doscussed the challenges the 
United 
Nations’ 
consensus 
requirement in decision-making 
poses when navigating climate 
change negotiations and creating 
a plan that countries will follow. 
“There’s no way that the UN 
has to force a country to do a 
particular thing,” Arvan said. 
“That means that every single 
nation has to be on board with 
every single significant step that 
we take to solve this problem. 
And right off the bat, that just 
makes it impossible to take more 
than incremental steps over 
twenty four years.”
Arvan 
also 
discussed 
transitions as well as common but 
differentiated 
responsibilities, 
and how he saw examples of 
people worried about the effects 
of the United Nations’ missions 
on their income.

Art & Design 
students work
with people
with Alzheimer’s

The 
walls 
of 
Michigan 
Alzheimer’s Disease Center, a 
research hub and medical center 
for those facing memory loss, are 
dotted with bright watercolor 
paintings — “works of art,” as 
Hank Paulson, the director of the 
center and University professor 
of neurology, calls them. These 
paintings 
were 
created 
by 
patients in the center as part of a 
therapeutic program led by Anne 
Mondro, an associate professor 
at the School of Art & Design, 
and the students of her Memory, 
Aging and Expressive Arts class.
“When 
those 
people 
with 
dementia 
made 
those 
works 
of art, there was a feeling of 
accomplishment 
that 
was 
satisfying to them that basically 
allowed them to be socially 
interacting 
with 
the 
world 
around them to have a positive 
impact themselves,” Paulson said. 
“And I think that is therapeutic.”
For the past 15 years, Mondro’s 
work has provided emotional 
support and brain stimulation 
for those suffering from memory 
loss in a state where Alzheimer’s 
Disease, the most prevalent form 
of dementia, is the sixth leading 
cause of death in the nation. As 

the Baby Boomer generation 
continues to age, the number 
of patients with Alzheimer’s 65 
and older is expected to grow 
22 percent by 2025 and raise 
Medicaid costs by nearly 25 
percent, according to scientists. 
Alzheimer’s and other types of 
dementia progress slowly— the 
average person lives between four 
and eight years after receiving 
the diagnosis — so memory loss 
centers often focus on raising a 
patient’s quality of life through 
programs 
like 
Mondro’s 
art 
therapy. Kathi Tobey, a memory 
loss 
specialist 
at 
Michigan 
Medicine’s Silver Club Programs, 
said art offers those living with 
dementia an outlet for creativity 
in ways words often cannot. 
“(Creative art) doesn’t have 
boundaries,” Tobey said. “As 
memory loss increases, (people 
who are diagnosed) can still can 
be creative, they just are more 
creative in an abstract way. So a 
lot of the art that gets produced 
for our folks with moderate 
memory loss, is more abstract ... It 
doesn’t have to be done a certain 
way, so it offers folks this avenue 
that is open-ended.”
Mondro’s work focuses mainly 
on the intersection of art, illness 
and disease. In 2014, Mondro 
began offering a course to Arts & 
Design students — an outgrowth 
of 
her 
previous 
community 
engagement course, Retaining 
Identity: the role of creativity in 
health care — created in 2006.

On June 17, 10 Univer-
sity of Michigan students 
and recent graduates expe-
rienced a day of Fox Sports 
coverage at the FIFA Wom-
en’s World Cup in Los Ange-
les. The students, who have 
all since graduated, were 
among the winners of the Fox 
Sports University challenge, 
a competition in which stu-
dents construct and propose 
brand campaign ideas to Fox 
Sports executives.
At the World Cup, the 
group met Fox Sports’ social 
media team and watched 
their coverage during live 
matches. They also toured 
of two Fox studios in Playa 
Vista and Los Angeles, in 
addition to witnessing a live 
broadcasting of Fox Soccer 
Tonight. 
University 
alum 
Sierre Wolfkostin, a mem-
ber of a winning team, said 
she enjoyed the tour, as Fox 
does not accommodate tour 
groups often.
“We got to visit over 10 
different teams that work 

there,” Wolfkostin said. “Not 
only their digital content 
production team that were 
actively sending out tweets 
and posts live and real-time 
in response to the Women’s 
World Cup game, but also 
we got to see their whole TV 
production studio and those 
teams.”
University alum Preston 
Rabban, another winning 
student, said his favorite 
experience was witnessing 
the action in the studio he 
often sees on his own TV 
screen.
“At the end when they 
were doing the live show, 
watching the live show right 
in front of you and being 
broadcast on the TV right 
next to you within seconds, I 
thought that was the coolest 
part,” Rabban said.
Wolfkostin 
said 
she 
enjoyed seeing every team at 
Fox work together to create 
the broadcast.
“At the end when you 
got to see them doing a live 
sports broadcast, you real-
ized how all of the parts 
added up together to cre-

ate one finished product,” 
Wolfkostin said. “Every little 
piece came in to create this 
production. You realize that 
it’s a lot more complicated 
than you initially think.”
During 
the 
Fall 
2018 
semester, Fox Sports Univer-
sity partnered with Universi-
ty professor Marcus Collins’ 
Social 
Media 
Marketing 
class. Students worked in 
groups to create original 
advertising campaigns for 
the 
2019 
FIFA 
Women’s 
World Cup and MLB Jewel 
events such as the All-Star 
Game and World Series. 
Each group was assigned a 
specific brand such as Taco 
Bell, Coca-Cola and Verizon 
to market to one of the two 
audiences.
The 13 groups ultimately 
proposed their campaigns to 
a panel of Fox Sports execu-
tives, including David Mill-
er, senior vice president of 
ad sales, and Emilee Cavis, 
senior director of sales and 
marketing.

Washtenaw Dairy, a long-
time staple in the Ann Arbor 
community, is celebrating 
its 85th anniversary on July 
4 with a celebration featur-
ing donuts, ice cream, live 
entertainment and street 
artist David Zinn. Washt-
enaw Dairy owner Mary 
Raab is excited for the 
upcoming celebration and 
believes these 85 years in 
business wouldn’t have been 
possible without the cus-
tomers. 
“I think there’s some-
thing about the business — 
we’re calling Legen-Dairy 
because we think it is — that 
has to do with the commu-
nity and the customers … 
and the businesses work-
ing together with us,” Raab 
said. 
Washtenaw Dairy first 
began its journey by selling 
bottled milk to its custom-
ers. According to Raab, the 
shop was one of 120 local 
dairies at its conception in 
1934, and she said it may be 
the last local dairy store. 

Though they no longer bot-
tle their milk, the Dairy still 
sells a wide variety of chees-
es, milk and other dairy 
options.
“We used to do home 
deliveries back in the day 
and about half our business-
es is distributing milk and 
dairy products,” Raab said. 
Washtenaw 
Dairy 
has 
been a family-owned busi-
ness since its founding. This 
was one of the main reasons 
Zaki Shafi said he became a 
manager, she said. 
“I just moved to the area 
this past August and I didn’t 
want to work for a corporate 
company anymore,” Shafi 
said. “It’s my first opportu-
nity to really have a sense 
of … crewmanship. That’s 
really been a privilege and 
a gift to me — to be in close 
communication with the 
owner of the establishment 
that I work for is pretty 
great.”
Keeping the business in 
the family pertains to the 
employees too, as Raab said 
she has had families whose 
involvement with the Dairy 
has spanned generations.

“We have some employ-
ees that are second-genera-
tion employees,” Raab said. 
“We have one business in 
town that we do business 
with three generations of 
that family all worked at the 
Dairy and now that busi-
ness is a customer of ours. 
It really makes a big differ-
ence and I just love it when 
people stop by.”’
LSA 
freshman 
Jack 
Harris, whose his grand-
mother worked with the 
current owner, said both 
employees and customers 
are treated like family.
“People 
who 
know 
about Washtenaw Dairy 
know that there’s a lot of 
— some people call them 
Old timers, we call them 
regulars — who come in, 
lots of mornings during 
the week, on the week-
ends,” Harris said. “And 
they’ll sit and they’ll have 
their donut, their coffee, 
they’ll read their paper. 
Same guys come in every 
day and chat.”

ZACK BLUMBERG | COLUMN
B

ack in January, I published 
my first ever column for 
The Daily, in which I 
derided Brexit as an unrealizable 
fantasy which could never be pulled 
off. Unfortunately, it seems I was 
only half right: Brexit remains an 
unrealizable fantasy, but Britain 
appears determined to go through 
with it anyway. Coinciding with 
the Conservative Party’s members-
only vote for the country’s next 
prime minister, YouGov polled 
Conservative Party members about 
Brexit — the results were terrifying 
and confirmed that Conservative 
Party members are willing to 
sacrifice just about anything for 
Brexit (important note: Unlike in the 
United States, members of British 
parties are only a small cohort of 
paying, registered party members 
who vote on internal party decisions, 
not simply all people who vote for 
the party in national elections). 
However, the survey results don’t 
only demonstrate ineptitude, but 
a shortsightedness which could 
ultimately mean the end of the 
Conservative Party. 
Fundamentally, 
two 
specific 
questions in the YouGov survey 
explain the entire mindset of the 
Conservative 
Party 
regarding 
Brexit. First, Conservative Party 
members seem far more worried 
about the Brexit Party than the 
Labour Party. When asked which 
parties they thought posed a serious 
problem for the Conservatives, 
members listed the Brexit Party 
nearly twice as often as the Labour 
Party — 67 percent said the Brexit 
Party was a major threat, while only 

34 percent said the Labour Party 
was. Second, Conservative Party 
members overwhelmingly believe 
that failing to deliver Brexit would 
damage the party going forward. 
An astonishingly large 51 percent of 
Conservative Party members said 
that if the U.K. remained in the EU, 
this would hurt the Conservative 
Party so much the party would never 
lead the government again. 
Though many of the survey 
results appear confusing, the two 
aforementioned questions provide 
some valuable context. Essentially, 
Conservative Party members believe 
they must push Brexit through or else 
their party will be ruined, and their 
voters, feeling betrayed, will migrate 
to the Brexit Party. With this in 
mind, some of the other poll answers 
make slightly more sense. In a 63-29 
percent split, party members said 
they would be O.K. with Scotland 
leaving the U.K. if it meant Brexit 
happened, and in a 61-29 percent 
split, members said it was O.K. if the 
U.K. suffered significant economic 
damage from Brexit. Within the 
party, many members probably see 
those consequences as sacrifices 
they might have to make in order to 
avoid being usurped by the Brexit 
Party. 54 percent of party members 
even said they would support Brexit 
if it meant the Conservative Party 
was destroyed, likely because they 
believe the alternative is the party 
being destroyed after failing to 
deliver Brexit. 
In the short term, Conservative 
Party members’ paranoia over Brexit 
is 
actually 
somewhat 
justified. 
Since former Conservative Prime 

Minister Theresa May first initiated 
the U.K.’s withdrawal by invoking 
Article 50 of the European Union 
Treaty in 2017, the Conservative 
Party’s Brexit paralysis has cost 
the party greatly. Discord among 
Conservative MPs over how Brexit 
should be carried out led Parliament 
to reject May’s proposed exit deal 
three times, which ultimately forced 
her to resign earlier this month. 
Throughout 
this 
bureaucratic 
slog, Brexit voters have grown 
continually more exasperated. As 
a result of the Conservative Party’s 
inability to carry out Brexit, Nigel 
Farage’s newly founded Brexit Party 
— which promised to get the U.K. 
out of the EU at any cost — won 
a plurality in the 2019 European 
elections, while the Conservatives 
finished fifth. With the defeat fresh 
in their minds, it is understandable 
that Conservative Party members 
see delivering Brexit as the Party’s 
only way forward. 
With that said, there are several 
key problems which could decimate 
the Conservative Party. In some 
ways, it may already be too late. 
Though the party now firmly 
supports Brexit, several years of 
dithering have hurt the party’s 
credibility among Brexiteers. The 
Conservative Party’s likely pick 
for prime minister, Boris Johnson, 
said recently the U.K. would leave 
the EU on Oct. 31 (the current 
deadline for Brexit), regardless of 
the consequences. This is the strong 
stance frustrated Brexit voters want. 
However, like the rest of his party, 
Johnson has been quite inconsistent 
on this issue. In the lead up to the 

actual Brexit vote back in 2016, he 
was unusually quiet, and although 
he eventually supported Brexit, he 
said the decision was “agonizingly 
difficult” — hardly the outspoken 
response one would expect from 
him. 
Unlike Johnson, Farage has been 
an outspoken critic of the EU for 
decades: After the U.K. signed a 
treaty which furthered European 
integration in 1992, he left the 
Conservative Party to form the 
U.K. Independence Party; he then 
founded the Brexit Party in January. 
Since founding UKIP, Farage has 
been the face of the Eurosceptic 
movement. For the Conservative 
Party, this poses a fundamental 
problem: If people are really as 
concerned about Brexit as party 
members believe, why would they 
pick the slow-moving, flip-flopping 
Boris Johnson over the ever-
consistent Nigel Farage? 
Furthermore, the Conservative 
Party’s biggest problem is how 
their approach sets the party up 
for the future. With the Brexit 
Party pushing the Conservatives 
to the right, the party now feels 
it must deliver Brexit at all costs 
to maintain power. However, this 
approach, combined with Britain’s 
changing 
demographics, 
could 
destroy the party. Although the 
U.K. did narrowly vote to leave 
the EU, three key groups voted 
overwhelmingly to remain: urban 
voters, young voters and university-
educated voters. The results were 
particularly 
one-sided 
among 
voters under the age of 25 (71 
percent voted remain) and voters 

with a university degree (68 percent 
voted remain). For the Conservative 
Party, this will be disastrous going 
forward. As older voters die off, 
Britain’s younger generation, which 
is consistently more progressive, 
will make up a larger and larger 
share of the electorate. Additionally, 
the British population is continually 
becoming more educated and more 
urbanized, which further threatens 
the Conservative Party. 
A decade from now, with all 
signs pointing towards the British 
populace being more pro-EU than 
today, 
the 
Conservative 
Party 
would be remembered as the party 
that decided to leave the EU, at 
the expense of the UK’s unity and 
economic prosperity. 
Ultimately, 
the 
Conservative 
Party is stuck in a corner right now. 
If the party is too weak on Brexit, 
it will face attacks from the Brexit 
Party. However, succumbing to 
the Brexit Party’s pressures, as the 
vast majority of party members 
seem prepared to do, would be a 
terrible mistake. Though it would 
likely retain slightly more power 
in the short term, the long-term 
consequences of a poorly planned 
Brexit would be catastrophic for 
both the party itself and the U.K. as 
a whole. Unfortunately, it appears 
the Conservative Party has taken 
this shortsighted approach and 
decided to hedge the party’s future, 
along with the economic health of 
the entire U.K., for small gains in 
the present.

ANNE ELSE | COLUMN

I

n our current political cli-
mate, environmental issues 
typically fall along party 
lines. 
Stereotypically, 
liberals 
tend to adhere to environmen-
tally friendly policies and climate 
change awareness, while con-
servatives do not embrace these 
issues in their platforms. While 
the politics of sustainability is 
definitely affecting the way peo-
ple view climate change and per-
sonal habits, there is also a basis 
of psychological factors that can 
determine a person’s view and 
use of these methods and poli-
cies. 
I recently watched an episode 
of the critically acclaimed HBO 
show “Big Little Lies,” which 
was heavily centered around the 
theme of environmental con-
sciousness. It depicted a young 
girl in second grade who suffered 
from a panic attack that stemmed 
from fear of climate change. She 
was extremely worried that the 
world would end after she was 
taught about startling environ-
mental facts from her teacher. 
Her reaction to climate change 
was full of anxiety and fear, 
which could make it difficult for 
viewers to understand that real 
change is possible.
This portrayal of the effects 
of climate change on the mind 
made me think about how our 
psychological state might affect 
how passionate we are about 
making changes. Even more, the 
way we are taught about these 
truths can affect our view of the 
world. If we are simply given 
staggering facts about the dying 
planet without any suggestions 
for how to make it better, our 
view of the world could become 
hopeless and scary.
If we can look at the hor-
rors that happen in the world 
through a mindset of hopeful-
ness and willingness to change, 
then maybe it would be easier for 
everyone, no matter their politi-
cal affiliation, to combat these 
issues together. Viewing climate 
change with extreme denial or 
fear will clearly affect one’s desire 
to help in healing our Earth.
New research has delved into 
the basis of the psychology of sus-
tainability. As we know, human 
behavior is what has affected the 
planet in the first place. There-
fore, psychologists purporting 
changes in human behavior and 
psyche are what will drive moti-
vation and participation in sus-

tainable practices and advocacy. 
A research project from Min-
nesota Pollution Control Agency 
presents helpful plans for sus-
tainability based on psychologi-
cal changes. They explain that a 
key way to increase sustainable 
behavior is to make it a “social 
default.” Humans tend to look to 
others for social cues and infor-
mation. Thus, if leading an eco-
conscious lifestyle by reducing 
carbon footprints and spreading 
eco-friendly 
information 
was 
the norm, sustainability would 
increase 
dramatically, 
which 
can be done by getting to know 
neighbors’ habits and views on 
the environment. This will help 
make positive and inclusive con-
versations about environmental 
change more common. 
So 
how 
can 
we 
imple-
ment these positive ideals into 
upcoming 
generations? 
Jour-
nalist Barbara Malt says uni-
versities should include more 
environmental psychology class-
es to educate students on the 
impact of human behavior. This 
type of hybrid class would allow 
students to find relatable course-
work and information on how 
we can change our psychological 
outlook on our planet. She con-
cisely explains why this subject 
intersection is necessary, stating, 
“Because human behavior is at 
the root of these environmental 
problems, science and technology 
alone cannot create the solutions 
we need ... To create solutions, 
there must be a belief in the need 
for change, the will to make and 
sustain change, and effective 
means of creating change.”
This type of environmental 
teaching will give young adults 
a sense of understanding and 
confidence in how to make sig-
nificant and positive impacts on 
the future of our ecosystems.; 
it should extend to all years of 
schooling and be taught in a posi-
tive and action-oriented light. (If 
you’re interested in this topic, 
University of Michigan is offering 
a psychology and environment 
cross-listed course this fall titled 
Behavior and Environment).
Thankfully, the field of envi-
ronmental psychology is grow-
ing. Their specialized research 
focuses on human reaction to 
different environmental issues 
and phenomena. The American 
Psychological Association lists a 
few ways that these psychologists 
are applying their knowledge 

to the real world. They “con-
duct research on messages that 
motivate people to change their 
behavior, spread the word about 
environmental solutions, uncov-
er why people may not adopt pos-
itive behaviors, encourage people 
to rethink their positions in the 
natural world, and help clients to 
live more sustainable lives.” 
Some people might not want 
to buy into the advantages of liv-
ing a sustainable life and choose 
to ignore environmental politics 
and action. This viewpoint can 
also be explained through psy-
chological terms that Steve Tay-
lor, psychologist and professor at 
Leeds Beckett University in the 
U.K., suggests. The psychologi-
cal explanation of why people are 
able to continually ignore detri-
mental environmental changes 
and not feel bothered to change is 
because of the presence of “ego-
separateness.” 
This 
includes 
an overly intensified sense of 
independence and individuality, 
which allows some people to feel 
disparate from nature and wild-
life.
The results of this individu-
alistic mindset are people do 
not feel responsible for their 
planet or the vast lands cover-
ing it. There is a lack of “duty to 
preserve (nature’s) harmony.” 
This psychological understand-
ing of people who do not support 
eco-friendly endeavors makes 
sense to me when I examine the 
extremely individualistic tenden-
cies of Western countries. Amer-
ica, in particular, stereotypically 
values individual achievements 
and the ability to be independent-
ly successful as our most impor-
tant characteristics. This could 
very well be fueling the uniquely 
American ability to consistently 
ignore environmental issues. 
Take 
a 
few 
environment 
courses to solidify your knowl-
edge in the subject, talk to your 
housemates or neighbors on their 
views and habits, allow for envi-
ronmental love to be normal and 
appreciated. Understanding our 
own psychological barriers will 
help us attain sustainable mind-
sets that will assist our futures 
and our homes. For the future of 
our families, friends and foes, we 
must get past our individualistic 
cultural values and find ways to 
help environmental causes.

“You can never publish my love,” 
Rogue Wave chants, in the song that 
the title of this series riffs on. Maybe 
that’s true, and we can never quite 
account for our love on paper or in 
print, but we sure can try. That’s what 
this series is devoted to: publishing our 
love. Us, the Arts section of The Michi-
gan Daily, talking about artists, some 
of the people we love the most. Perhaps 
these are futile approximations of love 
for the poet who told us we deserve to 
be heard, the director who changed the 
way we see the world, the singer we 
see as an old friend. But who ever said 
futile can’t still be beautiful? 
In John Green’s 2012 novel “The 
Fault in Our Stars,” protagonist 
Hazel Grace Lancaster thinks to her-
self: “Sometimes, you read a book and 
it fills you with this weird evangeli-
cal zeal, and you become convinced 
that the shattered world will never 
be put back together unless and until 
all living humans read the book. And 
then there are books like ‘An Imperial 
Affliction,’ which you can’t tell people 
about, books so special and rare and 
yours that advertising your affection 
feels like betrayal.”
Like Hazel Grace with “An Impe-
rial Affliction,” John Green’s work 
feels intensely personal to me. It’s 
evangelical-zeal-inducing and for-
mative in every sense of the word, 
not only emotionally or intellectually, 

but also in terms of real relationships 
Green’s work has impacted my life. 
I’m pretty sure I can credit his You-
Tube channel, “Vlogbrothers,” as the 
catalyst for one of my very closest 
friendships from high school. He’s 
inspired, frustrated and taught me 
endlessly. I think I would have turned 
out a lot differently if his books had 
never been in my life, for better or for 
worse. 
Let’s go back to the start. John 
Green, for the three people still unini-
tiated, is the massively famous author 
of young adult books like “Looking 
for Alaska,” “The Fault in Our Stars,” 
“Paper Towns” and many more. He’s 
also one of the original YouTube 
stars, beginning with “Vlogbroth-
ers” in 2007, which he shares with 
his brother Hank. His online success 
has since expanded to developing and 
hosting the educational series “Crash 
Course,” as well as several popular 
podcasts.
John Green has been a public fig-
ure for almost two decades now, but 
I found him about 7 years ago. My big 
sister Eden pressed a library copy of 
“Looking for Alaska” into my hands 
and told me, “This book is really 
important, you should read it.” Eden 
had just graduated high school and I 
was a few weeks away from starting 
my freshman year, so it felt less like 
a recommendation and more like an 
induction. Welcome to adolescence, 
the book seemed to tell me. Good luck. 
It caught hold almost immediately. 
There’s something raw and exposed 
about “Looking for Alaska”, nearly 

intrusive in how intimate reading it 
feels. It tells the story of 15-year-old 
Miles Halter as he attends boarding 
school in Alabama and encounters his 
first friendships, first teenage hijinks, 
first love, first tragedy. “Looking For 
Alaska” centers on the relationship 
between Miles and the mysterious 
Alaska, a troubled teenage girl who 
seems equally interested in soaking 
in as much joy and excitement as she 
can as she is in destroying herself. 
The book is split into two parts, 
simply titled “Before” and “After,” 
but throughout both sections, Alas-
ka as a character never quite makes 
sense. One minute, she’s warm and 
thrilling, the next she’s withdrawn 
and acerbic. We see her in fragments, 
never learn her full backstory and 
very rarely hear what she actually 
wants and needs from her life. As a 
result, she never feels quite like a real 
person, which is a point on which a 
lot of critics have taken issue with 
the novel. But to me, that’s always 
felt exactly right, because the way 
we see her is decidedly a product 
of Miles’ perceptions and imagina-
tions. From their very first moments 
together, Miles is too busy marveling 
at the shape of her lips to listen to the 
words she’s actually saying. Alaska 
dies horrifically midway through 
the book, leaving Miles and the rest 
of the friends around her to muddle 
through trying to understand why. 
(Spoiler: They never do. Prediction: 
They never will.) 
No matter how many times I read 
it, the book leaves me with a sort of 

hollow feeling in my stomach. Not 
only because of the precision with 
which love, obsession, grief and trau-
ma are rendered by Green’s prose, but 
because “Looking For Alaska,” and 
really all his work, always immedi-
ately rips me back to who I was when 
I first read it. Each character in his 
novels is unique and specific, and yet 
I can’t help but think of my group of 
friends in high school and see each of 
them in the Colonel, Takumi, Miles 
and Alaska. I start remembering 
some of the awful things that hap-
pened when we were 15, our version 
of the “Before” and “After,” and the 
hollow feeling in my gut expands, 
twists into hurt. 
When I’m thinking about why this 
is, why Green’s work hits me so hard, 
I like to imagine he treats memory 
as if it’s a coin. Flip it to one face and 
you get nostalgia; flip it to the other 
and you get a darker, mournful side. 
Green’s writing registers emotion-
ally like a series of those coin tosses, 
equal parts regretful and wistful. 
Sometimes he writes stories like a 
rosy memory of a better time, and 
it’s only because of how sharply and 
precisely he renders those memories 
that he can use them like a weapon. 
In Green’s hands, something joyful 
like a first love, or a happy road trip 
between friends, can take a sharp 
turn into tragedy and heartbreak 
as quickly as it does in real life. The 
sweet side of the coin has flipped 
without the reader even realizing, 
and it leaves you breathless. 
If “Looking for Alaska” were the 
only book Green had ever written, I’d 
probably still count him as one of the 
most important authors in my life, 
but Green has written six books. Even 
though I don’t think he’s ever been 
quite as raw as “Alaska,” that sense of 
longing permeates through all of his 
books. Even the cringier parts of his 
books resonate — I find that actually, 
their imperfection is exactly what 
makes them feel so real to me. 
Green has gained a bit of a reputa-
tion in recent years for tending toward 
the overwrought. He uses a lot of 
extended metaphors and often gives 
his characters long soliloquies about 
the meaning of life. He (like many 
other YA authors) also likes picking 
a classic piece of literature to weave 
admittedly pretty heavy-handedly 
throughout his novels as a motif. But 
none of that has ever bothered me, 
mostly because none of it ever regis-
ters as false or insincere, but rather an 
earnest expression of the story he’s 
trying to tell and the way his teenage 
characters feel. Teenagers tend to get 
a little overwrought sometimes. They 
mix their metaphors. They latch real-
ly hard onto classic literature they at 
times don’t fully understand. Some-

times I read the emails my friends 
and I would send each other in high 
school and I cringe so hard I actually 
feel my soul exit my body for a minute 
because it’s so eager to distance itself 
from the kind of pretentious buffoon 
who would write that shit. 
But John Green never attempts 
any kind of distance between 
16-year-old buffoonery and the nar-
rative writ large — instead, he leans 
into it. He captures so accurately the 
way everything feels epic and cin-
ematic, almost embarrassingly so, 
when you’re that age. When I was in 
high school, a fight with a friend was 
absolutely apocalyptic, while a drive 
with the windows down meant we 
had just been crowned queens of our 
hometown streets. It didn’t just feel 
that way; it was that way in my eyes. 
Green knows that, he gets it and most 
importantly, he respects it. 
Green also crucially understands 
that a lot of the things that happen to 
teenagers aren’t small and overblown. 
Teenagers deal with heartbreak, 
death, grief, betrayal and awful pain 
the same exact way everyone else 
does. I went through some really real 
shit in high school. My friends did too, 
often way worse. Sometimes we were 
there for each other and sometimes 
we weren’t. Sometimes we hurt each 
other. Sometimes we fundamentally 
misimagined each other. Through 
every moment, though, I had a ref-
erence to understand what was hap-
pening to me, because I had John 
Green’s books. I knew I was never 
alone. It’s like Miles says in “Looking 
for Alaska”: “It always shocked me 
when I realized that I wasn’t the only 
person in the world who thought and 
felt such strange and awful things.” 
Green’s books often finish on an 
open-ended note, with his protago-
nists pondering all the life they have 
left to live and accepting the ambigu-
ity of whatever conflict they’ve been 
struggling with. As a teenager, that 
was always the one part I wasn’t fully 
able to relate to. I didn’t know how to 
zoom out, so to speak, to see anything 
beyond my very singular experience 
and think about possibility as some-
thing more than an abstract concept.
I think I’m a little better at that 
now. Maybe it’s time, maybe it’s 
growing up, maybe it’s years of train-
ing kicking in after so much time 
spent reading John Green books 
about kids exploring all the possibili-
ties in their futures. But either way, 
I can contemplate that a little better 
now. Not fully or perfectly, mind you, 
but I’m at least starting to wrap my 
head around how young I actually 
am and how many choices I have.

Have you ever wondered what 
would happen if a select assortment 
of pop culture phenomena ceased to 
exist, only for a handful of people to 
remember them and have to figure 
out what to do with that memory?
I haven’t either, but “Yesterday” 
builds a premise around that hyper-
specific conflict, specifically as it 
pertains to The Beatles and the lone, 
previously unsuccessful musician 
who remembers them, Jack Malik 
(Himesh Patel, “EastEnders”). It 
was a calculated risk — reportedly, 
10 million dollars’ worth — to bank 
an entire film on such a particular 
dilemma. Why not another band? 
Better yet, why not pose the same 
question of another historical phe-
nomenon: something of graver con-
sequence, like a war? But it’s not my 
place to postulate about what they 
could have done; I’m assessing what 
they did. While they ran with their 
initial risk, the makers of “Yester-
day” played it safe otherwise, and left 
us with a harmless but perfunctory 
romantic comedy.
Humor has the potential to make 
laughable concepts appear intelli-
gent. Shows like “Seinfeld” got away 
with it for years. Such an application 
of humor is vital for a film like “Yes-
terday,” to get us past the peculiarity, 
if not absurdity, of its scenario. In the 
movie, however, the humor was hit 
or miss, depending partly on who 
you are. Just as some of the jokes on 
the original “Office” bewilder fans of 
the American adaption, “Yesterday”’s 
British brand of humor may not reso-

nate with the Yankees in the crowd 
who aren’t bloody interested in the 
BBC. It relied heavily on situational 
comedy and deadpan delivery, both 
of which Patel had the perfect, non-
plussed face for.
Regardless of who you are, how-
ever, the bulk of “Yesterday”’s humor 
will feel like it’s missing something, 
and that’s self-deprecation. It’s what 
made Ed Sheeran’s (“Bridget Jones’s 
Baby”) cameo so surprisingly hilari-
ous with all the jokes about “ginger 
rap” and subpar lyricism he had to 
dodge, and Kate McKinnon’s (“The 
Spy Who Dumped Me”) brutally 
honest assessments of record execu-
tives’ intentions wickedly funny. 

Curiously, “Yesterday” relegated this 
kind of humor to the sidelines, when 
its absurd, world-without-Beatles, 
butterfly-effect-be-damned 
main 
storyline needed it most. We can’t 
be expected to take you seriously if 
you’re not self-aware enough to laugh 
at your quirks.
An exercise in self-deprecation: If 
I were in Jack’s place, one of the few 
remaining keepers of The Beatles’s 
music, I’m afraid whatever musi-
cal genius John, Paul, George and 
Ringo offered the world would be 
lost. That’s not what screenwriter 
Richard Curtis (“Mamma Mia! Here 
We Go Again”) had in store for Jack, 
however, and this element of the film 

makes a bold, albeit probably inadver-
tent, comment on musical genius. By 
allocating Jack the same proportion 
of success The Beatles enjoyed from 
their work, the film implies songs are 
habitable rather than the product of 
unique genius, a nice jolt to the West-
ern conception of creativity. There’s 
a clumsiness to even this maneuver, 
however, as the remakes of Beatles’s 
hits are touristy, forgettable covers at 
best, and, on top of the musical medi-
ocrity, no one in the movie ever paus-
es to interrogate what, if anything, 
makes Beatles lyrics timeless.
That is another one of the film’s 
biggest faults: With classic cinematic 
mistrust of audience’s intelligence, 
it either brushes over or hastens to 
answer all of the questions it raises. 
The one original question it stammers 
out, it hastens to answer in no uncer-
tain terms for us. Jack’s ethical dilem-
ma, as to whether he should pass off 
another’s work as his own? Solved. 
The romantic void Jack must cope 
with as his fame accelerates expo-
nentially? Filled. Don’t you know, his 
best friend Ellie (Lily James, “Baby 
Driver”) has been in love with him all 
his life, and her confession suddenly 
flips a switch for him. Yes, “Yester-
day”: The clumsy comedy comes with 
clumsy love story on the side. Not 
what you ordered? Once again, me 
neither.
“Yesterday” does very little harm, 
but also little notable good, tak-
ing few risks, aside from building 
a movie around a world where the 
Beatles didn’t record their own songs. 
You’re probably better off queuing up 
Abbey Road and asking yourself what 
your life would be like without those 
songs, than seeing this film’s mini-
mally inventive take on that question. 

‘Yesterday’ lacks originality

FILM REVIEW

UNIVERSAL PICTURES

On June 25, Courtney Barnett 
opened for The National at Hill 
Auditorium. Hill is a big venue, 
and people were still filing in 
when Barnett took the stage. 
She began with “Avant Gar-
dener,” a song whose title is so 
endearingly clever that I wish 
I’d thought of it myself. 
I’ll say now that I wasn’t a 
huge fan of Barnett before hear-
ing her live. Something about 
her speak-singing felt overly 
stylized, and her lyrics seemed 
too crammed with Dylanesque 
forced rhymes. Live, she was a 
whole new ball of wax. Barnett 
is smaller than I expected, pix-
ie-like, with a long mullet that 
made me fantasize about get-
ting the same haircut. She sort 
of looks like Shailene Woodley. 
Either way, she came across as 
both intimidatingly cool and 
familiar, like someone you’d 
strike up a conversation with at 
a co-op party. 
It’s hard to pinpoint exactly 
what was so incredible about 
Barnett’s 
performance. 
Her 
voice isn’t lovely, exactly; she 
mostly yells or speaks along 
with the music. She’s an excep-
tional guitar player, but that 
alone doesn’t explain it. I think 
it’s her enthusiasm, the unapol-
ogetic excitement with which 
she performs. Her whole set had 
the energy of that scene in “Back 
to the Future” where Michael J. 
Fox plays Johnny B. Goode. She 
hopped around the stage, her 
feet constantly shuffling and 
moving. As she sang, Barnett 
dipped her guitar into a never-
ending series of maneuvers, 
as if she were the professional 
partner in a “Dancing with the 
Stars” tango and her guitar was 
the celebrity. At one point she 
leaned forward, left leg rising 
behind her like a figure skater, 
as if she’d become Tonya Hard-
ing on season 26 of “Dancing 
with the Stars.” My point is that 
Barnett was completely mes-
merizing. The only person she 
even remotely reminds me of is 

a young Melissa Etheridge, who 
I’ve never seen live but whose 
early concert videos show the 
same kind of physicality. Bar-
nett’s head-banging was no less 
thrilling. 
The National came onstage 
a few minutes after Barnett’s 
giddy farewell (“Thank you!” 
in a ripper Australian accent). 
Anyway: The National. The 
large screens on each side of the 
stage flashed pixelated videos 
as they set up, which reminded 
me of those old ads about movie 
piracy in which illegally down-
loading a movie is compared to 
stealing purses and televisions. 
Unfortunately, The National’s 
performance was as ineffective 
as those warnings. 
They began with “You Had 
Your Soul With You” from 
their most recent album, I Am 
Easy to Find. It sounded good 
in a tight, controlled way — the 
opposite of Barnett’s freewheel-
ing, experimental sound. The 
next few songs were also from I 
Am Easy to Find: “Quiet Light,” 
“The Pull of You,” “Hey Rosey.” 
They all sounded overproduced 
to the point of flatness, and the 
instruments were so loud that 
I could barely hear frontman 
Matt Berninger’s voice. I could 
decipher a few words thanks to 
Berninger’s habit of acting out 
the lyrics in a series of jerky 
motions that looked uncannily 
similar to the five movements 
from “The OA.”
Once, Berninger walked out 
along a side aisle and pinned an 
uncomfortable-looking 
audi-
ence member up against the 
wall, plucking the man’s base-
ball cap from his head and sing-
ing plaintively to him. The guy 
laughed nervously and darted 
away as soon as Berninger 
moved on. This episode, like 
so many in the show, was both 
indulgent and bizarre. I don’t 
quite know why Berninger’s 
physical exhortations were so 
irritating, but maybe the raw, 
unassuming quality of Barnett’s 
performance primed me with a 
low tolerance for theatrics.

The annual Ann Arbor Summer 
Festival, which started June 14 
and ends July 7 with a different set 
of events each day from Tuesday 
through Sunday every week, has 

made a commitment to become a 
zero-waste event within the next 
few years, as advertised on the 
festival website. This year’s goal is 
to ensure 75 percent of the event’s 
waste is either composted or 
recycled, with three-stream waste 
receptacles throughout the event 

and extra volunteers to guarantee 
they achieve this goal.
Praveena 
Ramaswami, 
an 
employee of Toyota, which has 
been a sponsor for 11 years, said 
this initiative has tremendous 
benefits for the community.
“This year we have challenged 

the festival to go zero-waste in 
the next five years,” Ramaswami 
said. “I love that this festival is not 
only a place where people of the 
community can get together of all 
ages ... but they can also learn how 
they impact their environment.”
Ann Arbor resident Edward Qyu 
said he was glad to see companies 
taking part in the festival’s zero-
waste iniative.
 
“I 
think 
this 
is 
super 
important,” Qyu said. “I think 
companies need to take more 
initiative than only individuals at 
the household level.”
Anjali Balani was also pleased 
by 
the 
festival’s 
zero-waste 
initiative.
“I really like it. I was really 
impressed by it,” Balani said. 
“Whenever I go to throw away 
something 
there 
is 
always 
someone telling me ‘put this here, 
put that there,’ because it’s always 
really difficult to know if I should 
compost something or not.”
Brian McClemens, the front-
of-house manager for Top of the 
Park, the mainstage events housed 
in front of Rackham Graduate 
School, said performances are 
a huge part of the festival’s 
attraction.
“I think it’s a combination of 
the amazing number of acts that 
we bring and the variety of the 
acts,” McClemens said. “Also, 

that in our 36th year we are such 
a tradition, that it has passed 
on from family to family and 
generation to generation, so that 
Top of the Park and the Ann Arbor 
Summer Festival has become how 
we celebrate the opening of the 
summer.”
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Ach 
Adhveryu said he enjoys returning 
to the festival every year because 
it attracts his entire family with 
kid-friendly events.
“This is one of my favorite 
summer things to do in Ann 
Arbor,” Adhveryu said. “I come 
here every year with my family. 
Kids love it — they run around, 
hang out, have good food and 
listen to music.”
To 
reduce 
the 
amount 
of 
plastic bottle usage, the festival 
implemented 
water 
stations 
this year. A Festival Footprint 
Learning Center had its own 
booth within the festival to 
inform attendees of what they can 
do to reduce their footprint. 
Some of the performances are 
held in the Power Center and 
Hill Auditorium and require a 
purchased ticket. Ohio resident 
Dave Steenrod said having events 
that are both free and have a 
cost give attendees a variety of 
options.

“Paris, Je t’aime” 
I’m gonna be honest, this senti-
ment did not really stick with me 
after I finished my study abroad. 
It’s not that I hate the city or I 
have anything against my experi-
ence there after three weeks, but 
I think my perspective of one of 
the most well-known cities in the 
world has certainly developed into 
something that has allowed me to 
read between the lines of what is 
presented and what actually is. I 
would instead, change this senti-
ment to “Paris, Je tu connais” — 
Paris I know you.
A group of black students from 
the University of Michigan go 
to Paris for three weeks, spread 
out amongst the city in different 
arrondissements, or districts, and 
explore the food, art and culture in 
their free time. 
I was elated when I got the email 
with “Congratulations” plastered 
across my phone screen saying 
I had received the once in a life-
time opportunity to go to Paris 
for almost a month to learn about 
black culture. After almost six 
years of studying French, I wanted 
to immerse myself in the culture. 
More than anything else, I was 
finally able to speak the language 
that was once limited to me in a 
classroom setting. The excitement 
and nervousness building up to liv-
ing in France was expected, and it 
was not until I landed in the coun-
try that reality hit.
Blackness amongst a community 
of black people is not exactly uni-
versal.
I know, this is not something 
that makes much sense at first, but 
let me explain. 
Paris, although known as one of 
the biggest places for art and cul-
ture under the eye of Eurocentric-
ness, is also the home to many black 
people. Some are first generation 
French whose only cultural ties 
are those from their parents and 
their homes in Africa. Others came 
to Paris for the opportunities in 
Europe, and some are generations 
removed from their roots — much 
like here in America. The biggest 
difference, however, is “Blackness” 
is not something that is not some-
thing that is shared (across the 
Atlantic/in other countries). 
When I walk across campus 
or sit in a class, I can be assured 
that I and the only black person 

in a space will acknowledge each 
other. Not because we know each 
other or even because we had 
seen each other around before. It 
is simply because we understand 
that, although we may not actually 
know each other’s names, there is 
something that ties us together, 
and that is being black in a white 
world. Head nods, greetings and 
even a wave are all things that I 
can rely on when I run into another 
black person in America, because 
we have come to understand that 
there is unity in our shared but 
also different experiences. This, 
however, is not the same in France. 
As the story goes, a group of stu-
dents from our trip to Paris went 
to explore the day before class 
started and ran across a group of 
black, Parisian kids on their way 
home after school. One person in 
our group nodded their head in 
acknowledgement and the kid he 
made eye contact with him shook 
his head in bewilderment and said, 
“Je connais tu?” — I know you? This 
same incident repeated itself over 
and over again until we brought it 
up in class. Little did we know that 
France does not acknowledge race. 
Under the motto of “Liberty, 
Equality, Fraternity” is the agree-
ment of unity. A unity that sees 
everyone as equal under every law, 
and this includes identity. Howev-
er, this unity comes with the price 
that differences amongst people 
are not to be acknowledged. This 
includes race, religion or wealth. 
While wealth makes sense due to 
the roots of the French Revolu-
tion, the idea of not acknowledging 
race or religion was something that 
shocked me. Much of my identity is 
rooted in my blackness, as it is for 
many other people, and the idea 
of not being able to discuss this 
amongst other people was alarm-
ing. 
It goes without saying that, 
although race is not acknowledged 
in France, racism most definitely 
exists. Racism existed through 
the black, male security guards 
planted at almost every store with 
the intent to “intimidate” custom-
ers or the black women who I saw 
nannying white children as they 
pushed strollers around the neigh-
borhood and on the metro station. 
As the only black professor who 
studies blackness in France, Pap 
Ndiaye puts it — many of the Black 
people we saw working as nannies 
or security guards had received the 
same degrees to those of the white 
store owners or families they work 

for, but were refused high-ranking 
jobs based on the color of their skin 
. That sounds similar to the same 
job discrimination that many black 
people face in the United States. 
With the exception that there is 
nothing that can be legally pros-
ecuted in court based off discrimi-
nation of race. 
This fact hit especially close to 
home when I was followed around 
a clothing store by a black man 
who had seen me as a potentially 
“risky customer.” I was angry at 
the fact that he was put into a posi-
tion that only allowed other people 
to profit off of his “image” of being 
intimidating and even angrier he 
assumed I was going to steal cloth-
ing. It was only after the fact that 
I realized that him following me 
around a store played into a soci-
etal standard he was trained to 
follow in order to keep his job. A 
job he had to take because France 
requires people to send in their 
photo ID’s when applying for jobs, 
which means discrimination can 
take place at any level of the job 
market. So, I replaced my initial 
anger with a sadness that acknowl-
edged the repeated incidents that 
took place during my time in Paris 
were above me — a result of a sys-
tem that does not acknowledge 
racial inequity saturated within 
the financial well-being of the 
black people who live in Paris.
This visible racial divide did not 
end in clothing stores or on metro 
stops, but followed us into muse-

ums. During our second week, we 
watched the Carter’s “Apesh*t” 
 
video and followed it with a tour of 
the Louvre to discuss of blackness 
in the space as well as the signifi-
cance of the music video. Our tour 
guide who specialized in giving 
“black tours”, a particularly “new 
and profitable” attraction for her 
business was outwardly dismissive 
and condescending to our group. 
Challenging our knowledge of art 
by asking us if we even knew who 
Michelangelo was disappointing 
to say the least, especially when 
it was followed by the outward 
objectification of black bodies by 
referring to “curly hair and strong 
physiques” as the only acknowl-
edgement 
of 
their 
existence 
besides telling us they were slaves 
at one point in time. No other 
information was offered about the 
existence of blackness in the Lou-
vre about who Jacob was in the 
Raft of the Medusa or the origin of 
the black sculptures in the muse-
um. The four to five black people 
we were shown had no name, no 
origin and no story because she 
did not know them. For a tour that 
was named “Black Images at the 
Louvre,” we were given very few 
details and left feeling like we were 
being used as a way for the woman 
to profit off us. 
I do not want to paint my 
experience as bad, because there 
were things that made the trip 
amazing for me, because it was 
outside of the public eye of what 

is deemed as an “attraction” in 
Paris.
Although blackness is not recog-
nized officially in Paris, I definitely 
cannot deny there were things I 
experienced there I absolutely loved. 
I loved the way people carried 
their baguettes around with them 
after they got off work -- a sense of 
national pride. France is a country 
that loves its bread, so much so that 
they have laws that place limits on 
the price of baguettes in the country.
I loved that the streets were 
windy and filled with history. The 
blue signs held their names and 
were filled with cars that were a 
little too close to the sidewalk.
I loved the way the Eiffel Tower 
sparkled at the tick of every hour 
for fifteen minutes in a way that lit 
up the sky while I shared a blanket 
with my friends at night.
I loved the hidden things I 
found when I ventured outside of 
tourist attractions, like the park 
I found that had a hidden cave, 
and the carnival I found hidden 
behind the cover of trees.
I loved that the McDonald’s 
tasted better than the ones here 
in the U.S. and served hotcakes 
with Nutella on the side. 
I loved that I got to visit Dis-
ney World Paris, whose lines 
were short, and where I took 
pictures with Pooh Bear near the 
castle.

A tale of two seasons: Michigan baseball’s turning point

It was a turbulent season for 
the Michigan baseball team.
The 
Wolverines 
started 
8-0, and then a troublesome 
California trip brought them 
back to the ground with back-to-
back losses. They had a hand on 
the regular season Big Ten title 
and lost their hold in the final 
two weeks. And when they had 
a 13-game win streak, they were 
swept by Texas Tech — a series 
that was their biggest test of the 
season. 
On 
May 
22nd, 
it 
looked 
like their season was over — a 
disappointment. 
In 
big 
series, 
Michigan 
faltered against teams it was 
better against, limping toward 
Sunday wins to avoid being 
swept behind first team all-Big 
Ten pitcher Jeff Criswell. 
There was no chance the 
NCAA 
tournament 
selection 

committee 
would 
choose 
a 
defeated Wolverine side that had 
lost six of eight.
On 
May 
23rd, 
Michigan 
was born again. It made an 
underdog run to the National 
Championship series, proving 
doubters wrong until June 25th.
There’s no way to look back 
at the Wolverines’ season in any 
way other than two splits: before 
and after May 23rd. 
Before, it was similar to 2018: 
packed full of talent, but a team 
that fell victim to momentum. 
This year Michigan had the most 
players awarded honors by the 
Big Ten — three first team, one 
second team, four third team and 
one All-Freshman selection. 
Sophomore 
designed 
hitter 
Jordan Nwogu went on a streak 
of 20 games averaging a near .500 
on-base percentage. Criswell had 
a sub-0.50 earned-run average 
for the first half of the Big Ten 
season. The Wolverines were 
good, but when it mattered most 

they had lost all momentum. 
And then with what could 
have been their last pitch of 
their season in the Big Ten 
Tournament, Nwogu saved it 
with a double. It gave Michigan 
momentum, 
but 
even 
more 
importantly it gave them a belief 
they could overcome setbacks. 
A ninth inning collapse, extra 
innings mistakes — it didn’t 
matter because this team had 
figured out something it took 
them two years to learn: it was 
good. 
It could win. 
Jimmy Kerr hit seven of his 
15 home runs in the 16 games 
since May 23rd. Jack Blomgren 
played through a broken finger. 
Christan Bullock finally got a 
starting spot, producing for the 
bottom half of the lineup. 
A 
tale 
of 
two 
seasons, 
Michigan’s team 153 managed to 
show its true self in just a month, 
finishing as the third best team 
in Wolverine baseball history.

Lack of pitching depth comes back to haunt Wolverines

OMAHA, Neb. – Pitching had 
been an issue for this Michigan 
team all season. Its No. 1 and No. 
2 starters, juniors Karl Kauffmann 
and Tommy Henry, have always 
been clear – and clearly good.
The rest of the pitching staff had 
been something of a question mark.
At the beginning of the season, 
the biggest question was who 
would fill the role of the No. 3 
starter 
with 
sophomore 
left-
hander Ben Dragani out for the 
season with an injury. Sophomore 
right-hander Jeff Criswell stepped 
nicely into that role, converting 
from a bullpen pitcher to a starter 
with marked success.
“You 
can 
see 
his 
growth; 
you can see his improvement,” 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich said of 
Criswell in March. “It’s been very 
impressive, and we’ve certainly 
needed it. Having a guy like Jeff on 
Sunday gives us a great chance to 
win or sweep every series that we 
play.”
From then on, the biggest 
question 
about 
this 
Michigan 
pitching staff had been its bullpen. 
As the season progressed, it 
became clearer and clearer that it 

lacked consistency and, to some 
extent, effectiveness. 
For a while, it looked as if 
Bakich had found a solution to 
that, scraping out wins on offense 
and taking advantage of the 
College World Series’ structure 
to 
alternate 
between 
starting 
Kauffmann and Henry. Criswell, 
in the meantime, came out of the 
bullpen for extended relief.
“We felt like he would better 
serve our team finishing the game 
off,” Bakich said. “It just kind of 
got to a point where we said: This 
really is a no-brainer. We need Jeff 
at the back end of the game.”
But in the College World Series 
final, a best-of-three affair, that 
strategy finally caught up to 
Bakich.
Game one went according to 
plan, with Henry tossing 8.1 strong 
innings. But Tuesday brought 
game two, and with it, trouble. 
Kauffmann, having pitched against 
Texas Tech on Friday, could not 
pitch again on such short rest. This 
left Bakich in a dilemma: should 
he pitch Criswell and have him 
unavailable for a potential game 
three, or should he use the pitch-
by-committee strategy and have 
both Kauffmann and Criswell for 
the final game?

Bakich chose the latter, starting 
freshman 
right-hander 
Isaiah 
Paige and using five other pitchers 
in relief in what became a 4-1 game 
two loss.
It was a bold strategy as it meant 
that everything would ride on 
game three. And when Kauffmann 
threw a solid first two innings 
Wednesday, it looked like it might 
pay off. But when he, on short rest, 
allowed three runs in the bottom of 
the third, and a walk to lead off the 
bottom of the fourth, Bakich sat 
him for Criswell, who went on to 
allow three more runs of his own. 
But Bakich had no choice other 
than to leave Criswell in. His 
bullpen was depleted from game 
two. Criswell settled down to an 
extent after the fourth, throwing 
two scoreless innings in the fifth 
and sixth before allowing one run 
in the bottom of the seventh as well 
as the eighth.
“Unfortunately, we issued a few 
too many free passes, especially 
with two outs, and then they 
capitalized and got the big two-out 
hit,” Bakich said. “Unfortunately, 
you give a team like that and an 
offense like that free passes, they’ll 
make you pay. And they made us 
pay.”
The damage was done. The 

Commodores had taken a lead and 
expanded it into a chasm. They 
would never surrender it.
Here, in game three of the 
College World Series finals, the 
Wolverines had to face the truth 
— their pitching staff lacked the 
depth it needed.
The seeds of a stronger and 
deeper pitching staff have been 
planted in players like Dragani, 
Paige, and sophomore southpaw 
Angelo Smith. And there’s plenty 

of evidence that Bakich and 
pitching coach Chris Fetter will be 
able to shape them into a unit that 
can bring the Wolverines back to 
Omaha.
But for now, Michigan’s pitchers 
were outmatched by a dangerous 
Vanderbilt lineup and an opposing 
pitching staff much deeper than 
its own. And if Bakich wants to 
cultivate a program that can get 
back to the biggest stage, it’s an 
issue he needs to fix.

As Howard’s tenure takes shape, confidence remains strong

Amid the excitement of Juwan 
Howard’s 
introductory 
press 
conference, there was an undeniable 
uncertainty ringing though Crisler 
Center. Neither Howard nor his 
players could speak to his on-court 
strategy and when asked about 
recruiting, Howard’s response was: 
“I haven’t just pinpointed exactly like, 
I’m going after the five-star, one-and-
dones or I’m going to recruit three-
star kids.”
That uncertainty has persisted. 
Howard made his first 2020 offer to 
five-star guard Joshua Christopher, 
seemingly signaling a change from 
John Beilein’s methodical recruiting. 
But then, barely 24 hours later, his 
second offer came — to Jabri Abdur-
Rahim, a four-star forward also 
offered by Beilein.
The point is, no one knows exactly 
what Howard will bring to Michigan, 
on or off the court.
And yet, within the program, the 
refrain is that none of that matters — 
at least not yet. Outside the program, 
those who have interacted with 
Howard maintain the same stance.
“Number one, I know he’s well 
respected in the NBA, and has really 
grinded it in coaching the last few 
years,” one high-major head coach 
told The Daily. ”I actually watched 
his press conference, cause above all, 
I’m just a fan of college basketball. I 
thought the emotion and passion he 
had at his press conference spoke for 
itself. So I’m a huge fan and I’m really 

pulling for him. I think it’s a great 
hire.”
Among the calming assurances 
regarding Howard’s inexperience 
is his reputation in the NBA, where 
he followed a 20-year playing career 
with six years as an assistant coach 
for the Miami Heat. Over the past 
two offseasons, Howard’s reputation 
landed 
him 
six 
head-coaching 
interviews.
But why then, if Howard is so 
respected and if his future success 
is treated as a certainty, have none 
of those six teams extended a head-
coaching offer?
For at least one team — the 
Cleveland Cavaliers, where Howard 
interviewed last month — the answer 
is clear: they found their man. His 
name is John Beilein. The similarities 
between the two, though, are more 
than meets the surface.
“You talk to Juwan and you talk to 
(Beilein), obviously they’re different 
people, but I think they have very 
similar values,” Mike Gansey, the 
Cavaliers’ assistant general manager, 
told The Daily. “They’re not overly — 
they don’t scream and yell, they’re not 
super aggressive. They’re more laid 
back, positive kind of guys.”
Then, 
he 
paused, 
perhaps 
providing some insight into why 
Cleveland 
ultimately 
settled 
on 
Beilein.
“Obviously, coach Beilein is an 
excellent Xs and Os guy. And Juwan, 
we don’t know yet.”
That difference will eventually be 
critical. And at some point, Howard 
will have to figure out those Xs and 

Os. But for the six NBA teams who 
interviewed him, the signs pointed to 
that happening.
For Gansey and the Cavaliers, the 
biggest was six years’ experience 
working under Erik Spoelstra and Pat 
Riley. That, along with endorsements 
from those who had worked with 
Howard, landed him an interview 
with Cleveland. From there, his 
personality took over.
“When you sit with him for six, 
seven hours, you know he’s a really 
good person, you can just feel it,” 
Gansey said “You hear it from 
everyone else and you see it, but until 
you really sit down and talk to him, 
then you really feel it — he’s all that. 
There’s not a bad bone in his body and 
he’s positive, he works.
“It’s just the Xs and Os and just 
getting used to being a head coach 
that I think will take a little bit of 
time. But he’ll figure it out.”
As for the never-been-a-head-
coach stigma, Gansey is careful to 
note that Howard has coached in the 
summer league, giving him live-game 
head-coaching experience that he 
didn’t have as an assistant. Recruiting, 
though, is something Howard didn’t 
have to deal with in the NBA, and 
it showed in his uncertainty at last 
week’s press conference.
The common rebuttal has been 
the well-circulated story of Howard 
recruiting the rest of the Fab Five 
as the group’s first commit, which 
ignores that strategic aspect of 
constructing a recruiting class — a 
hurdle that Howard has already 
encountered. Andy Borman, a well-

known AAU coach whose players 
have been recruited by former NBA 
stars-turned-coaches such as Patrick 
Ewing and Chris Mullin, emphasized 
the importance of Howard hiring 
experienced assistants to smoothen 
that transition.
Less than a week after Borman 
spoke with The Daily, Howard hired 
Phil Martelli, the longtime Saint 
Joseph’s coach and definition of a 
home run hire if your top criteria is 
experience.
And then there’s the name.
“I think it’s the name Juwan 
Howard, I think it’s the name Fab 
Five, I think it’s also the name 
Michigan,” Borman said. “He’s a big 
name, talking about a school that 
checks so many boxes.”
Howard, though, left Michigan in 
1994. His best NBA season was 1996. 
Cristopher was born in 2001, Abdur-
Rahim in 2002.
So the natural question follows, 

does Juwan Howard’s name matter 
to recruits?
Borman 
scoffs, 
pauses 
and 
answers.
“It’s not like they’re recruiting in 
the 80s. Right now, with social media, 
with the internet, with YouTube. 
I turned on the TV (after the hire) 
and everything I see about Juwan 
Howard is him when he was a college 
player and when he was a pro. So even 
though his days as a player predate 
these kids, it’s not like they don’t have 
access to it.
“… He obviously has a pro 
background and I think that is so 
relevant to kids nowadays. Because 
what do they aspire to be? They 
aspire to be pros.”
The questions — whether they’re 
about recruiting or Xs and Os — 
are constant. And as Howard’s 
answers begin to take shape, so is the 
confidence in him.

Manuel presents fiscal year numbers, highlights athletic achievements

The University announced its 
projected budget for the athletic 
department at the end of June. It 
projects a balanced budget for the 
2020 fiscal year — which began 
July 1 — after finishing with a $1 
million surplus in the 2019 fiscal 
year.
Last year’s surplus is a result 
of $190.7 million in operating 
revenues against $189.7 million in 
operating expenses. The projection 
for fiscal year 2020 is based on 
$196.3 million in revenues and 
expenses.
The 2019 operating surplus of 
$1 million fell short of its budgeted 
amount of $2.5 million. The 

discrepancy is due to “higher-than 
budgeted transfers to the deferred 
maintenance fund,” according to 
a release from associate athletic 
director Kurt Svoboda.
In his presentation to the Board 
of Regents on June 20, athletic 
director Warde Manuel shared 
several projections for the new 
fiscal year. Among them are a 
$3.1 million increase in spectator 
admissions revenues, an increase 
of $2.8 million in conference 
distributions due to an increase in 
conference television revenues and 
an increase in salaries, wages and 
benefits by $2.9 million.
Along 
with 
information 
regarding the fiscal year budget, 
Manuel highlighted achievements 
by the athletic department, on 

and off the field. Included was a 
record 372 student-athletes named 
Academic All-Big Ten Conference. 
Seniors Siobhán Haughey from 
the women’s swimming and diving 
team and Robbie Mertz from 
the Michigan soccer team were 
recipients of the Big Ten Medal of 
Honor. The Wolverines also had 47 
student-athletes earn All-Big Ten 
first team honors and 10 athletes 
earn 
first-team 
All-America 
honors.
From a departmental standpoint, 
Michigan received eight NCAA 
Public Recognition Awards — a 
result of ranking among the top-10 
percent in the Academic Progress 
Rate 
report. 
It 
also 
finished 
in the top 10 in the Directors’ 
Cup standings in 13 sports. The 

Directors’ Cup is an award given 
by the National Association of 
Collegiate Directors of Athletics, 

based on points allocated for 
teams’ results in various NCAA-
sponsored championships.

The one out that doomed Michigan’s championship dream

The 
selection 
show 
was 
projected on a screen for all 
gathered around to see. Upon 
seeing their school name put into a 
bracket slot, the Michigan baseball 
players erupted in a cheer.
Some jumped to their feet in 
joy while others looked around 
for recipients to their high-fives, 
because the Wolverines were one of 
the last four teams into the NCAA 
Tournament after a turbulent end 
to their season jeopardized their 
spot. Though a long shot, it was a 
chance for a shot at the title, and a 
chance was all they needed.
Twelve games later, one of the 
last teams in was poised to be the 
“last one out.”
But that title eluded them after 
a meltdown in game three of the 
College World Series finals. And 
it all originated from the game-
changing third inning. That’s not 
to say Michigan would have won 
if it had given up zero runs at the 
bottom of the third, but with a 1-1 
game at that point, the team was 

one out from keeping it that way. 
In a game where the Wolverines 
could only muster two runs, the 
third inning collapse defined the 
game. By the end of it, all of the 
smiles and jubilance from the 
Wolverines’ dugout were traded 
for grim looks and sighs.
“I just think that Vanderbilt 
got 
5 
two-out 
RBIs 
tonight,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. 
“We’ve been doing 
that all postseason 
and they did that 
tonight.”
Karl Kauffman 
had pitched two 
innings. 
Despite 
allowing a home 
run in the second 
inning, the junior right-hander 
looked steady on the mound. He 
started the third as he had finished 
the second — with a strikeout. A 
groundout to third base all but 
reaffirmed that Kauffman had 
recollected himself after allowing 
the dinger.
Then it came — the breakdown.

Three pitches outside, one pitch 
too low; Kauffman dealt a 4-0 walk. 
A single down the middle off an 
0-2 count escalated the situation. 
A strike would have ended it, 
shutting down the threat. Instead, 
the Wolverines put a runner in 
scoring position, prolonging the 
chance for the Commodores to 
take the lead. And 
after 
two 
more 
walks, they did.
“We 
issued 
a 
couple too many 
free 
passes,” 
Bakich 
said, 
“especially 
with 
two outs, and then 
they 
capitalized 
and got the big two 
out hit.”
Kauffman 
walked Vanderbilt’s Philip Clarke 
to load the bases, sparking three 
teammates to trot down the 
warning track. It was time to 
heat up the bullpen. A second 
walk ended the stalemate. The 
Commodores were in control and 
now led, 2-1, only for the very next 
pitch thrown to be hit down the 

middle and widen the gap, 4-1.
A prompt visit from sophomore 
catcher Joe Donovan and a popout 
in the next at-bat stopped the 
bleeding. But the damage was 
done.
It boiled down to one out. They 
were one out from ending the 

third inning threat, one out from 
keeping Vanderbilt from taking 
the lead, one out from potentially 
being the last one out — the College 
World Series champions. 
“They just played better than us 
tonight,” Bakich said. “That’s why 
they’re the champs.”

Looking back at the historic wins that shaped the Wolverines’ run

Behind every deep tournament 
run are the wins that shaped the 
team. It was no different for the 
Michigan baseball team’s historic 
– and, at times, improbable – run. 
They don’t tell this team’s whole 
story. Nothing could. But they’re a 
good place to start. The Daily takes 
a look back of some of this season’s 
defining wins.
March 8 – Michigan 7, No. 2 
UCLA 5 
There’s a lot of talk in sports 
about “statement wins.” That’s 
what this was.
In a tough road environment 
against then-No. 2 UCLA, which 
spent most of the season as the 
best team in the country, junior 
left-hander Tommy Henry struck 
out ten over six innings of two-run 
baseball. Michigan scored four 
runs in the first inning, tacking on 
two in the third and one more in 
the eighth for insurance. 
This was the win that showed 
a flash of what this team could 
become, what they would become: 
a national contender. In the face 

and on the home turf of arguably 
the 
toughest 
competition 
the 
Wolverines 
faced 
all 
season, 
Michigan dominated the game. 
They never trailed.
It wasn’t the last time the two 
teams met this season either. 
May 23 – Michigan 5, Illinois 4 
One strike away.
Team 153 was one strike away 
from an early end to its season, 
one strike away from not making 
a postseason appearance at all, one 
strike away from this magical run. 
Luckily, sophomore designated 
hitter Jordan Nwogu had other 
ideas.
Michigan was down, 4-3, to 
Illinois in the bottom of the ninth 
inning. A loss to Ohio State the 
day before meant that falling to 
the Fighting Illini would send the 
Wolverines home for good.
Nwogu stepped up to the plate 
with two on and two out. With 
Michigan’s season on the line, he 
launched a two-run double to left 
center, and the Wolverines walked 
off with a 5-4 victory.
It was exactly the catalyst 
they needed. Since that win, the 
Wolverines have been hot. But 

it’s more than that. That was the 
win that introduced them to what 
Vanderbilt head coach Tim Corbin 
called their “playing personality”: 
free and loose, having fun, and 
playing to win – not just playing 
not to lose.
“We saw the end of our season 
right in front of us,” said senior 
first baseman Jimmy Kerr during 
the College World Series. “That 
kind of made the whole team 
appreciate every single game that 
we’ve had together since then. And 
that’s kind of the bigger picture. 
It’s not that we’re playing in a 
Regional, Super Regional, College 
World Series championship; it’s 
just that we get another game with 
each other.”
June 9 – Michigan 4, No. 1 
UCLA 2 
UCLA’s lineup was the best in 
the country. No one had been able 
to stop them all season. Michigan 
had as good as lost the game 
already.
Instead, the Wolverines pulled 
out a 4-2 victory to head to the 
College World Series. 
Henry, sick with the flu and 
pneumonia, and still recovering 

from the biceps tendonitis that 
rendered 
him 
inconsistent 
throughout much of the second 
half of the season, pitched seven 
innings 
of 
two 
run-baseball 
— containing a Bruins batting 
order 
that 
seemed 
practically 
unstoppable.
Sound familiar?
The first time Michigan played 
UCLA, it was just a flash of the 
team they could be. Three months 
later, they had gone even further.
June 15 – Michigan 5, Texas 
Tech 3 
The first time Michigan and 
Texas Tech met, it was proof of 
how far the Wolverines still had to 
go to be an Omaha contender. They 
were swept and outscored 29-10 
over three games.
Three 
months 
later, 
the 
Wolverines 
were 
an 
entirely 
different team — their bats hot, 
their pitchers cool and their 
defense firing on all cylinders. 
The Red Raiders provided the 
perfect litmus test: had Michigan 
really learned from its mistakes, 
and could it really compete at the 
highest stage in collegiate baseball?
The answer to both questions 

was 
an 
emphatic 
yes. 
The 
Wolverines got off to a quick start 
as a sacrifice fly from junior right 
fielder 
Jordan 
Brewer 
scored 
Nwogu in the top of the first. 
They tacked on three more in the 
third as Kerr launched a two-RBI 
triple down the right field line and 
scored on a single from senior third 
baseman Blake Nelson. 
Texas Tech made it close, 
scoring two runs in the bottom of 
the third and adding another in the 
bottom of the sixth, but Michigan 
was unshaken. They added a run 
in the top of the seventh when 
sophomore center fielder Jesse 
Franklin scored on an error for 
insurance, then cruised to a 5-3 
victory on the backs of solid 
pitching from junior right-hander 
Karl Kauffmann (7 innings, 8 
hits, 3 runs) and sophomore right-
hander Jeff Criswell (two solid 
innings of one-hit relief).
The Wolverines had made a 
statement: they were more than 
just a Cinderella team, and their 
run amounted to more than just 
luck.
Michigan, at long last, was a 
national contender again.
