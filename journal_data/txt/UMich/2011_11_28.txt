MICHIGAN 40, OHIO STATE 34

Hoke's irst team tastes redemption

Those who stay will redeem them-
Ryan Van Bergen stayed.
While his teammates mobbed Courtney
Avery, whose interception for the Michigan
football team sealed the 40-34 win over Ohio
State on Saturday, Van Bergen slowly walked
to the sideline, his hands on his head.
He flipped off his hel-
met, collapsed on the blue
bench and wept.
The crowd's roar was
deafening as Jake Ryan
pulled Van Bergen close,
whispering in his ear.
Then Craig Roh did the
same. They told Van Ber-
gen how much his leader- TIM
* ship meant, how much of ROHAN
an impact he had on them.
The fifth-year senior
had to answer for why the defense was so bad
for three years. Now, he could stand proudly
and boast about one of the best units in the
country.
"Michigan probably needed this win to
solidify what we've done this season as a
program," Van Bergen said after the game.
"This game is more than a win in the win

column. It's bigger than that. It encompasses
way more. Our team feels like we finished the
season. ... We went out the way we wanted to
go out.
"We put Team 132 in the books forever. I
think this team will always be remembered
as the team that set a new standard and re-
established what Michigan is supposed to
be about. I'm just glad I was a senior, being a
part of it."
Denard Robinson stayed.
When the game ended, he led the sprint to
the student section to sing "The Victors." His
337 total yards and five touchdowns will be a
part of history, but Team 132 will remember
how he willed Michigan to finally beat the
Buckeyes.
Brady Hoke finally found balance for Rob-
inson in a "makeshift" offense, one that fit the
quarterback who once thought of transfer-
ring before Hoke arrived in January.
Now, the quarterback who had been beaten
up - by his critics and by Big Ten defenses -
smiled wider than ever.
"I'm just glad I'm playing with these guys
because I wouldn't rather be (anywhere)
else," Robinson said.
"I'm glad I stayed."

Greenville remembers
legacy of Fred Meijer

4

Owner of Midwest
chain died on
Friday at age 91
GREENVILLE, Mich. (AP) -
Art by famous sculptor Marshall
Fredericks sits in the middle of
Greenville, bike paths connect
neighborhoods and a local hos-
pital has expanded - all due to
the generosity of the small town's
favorite son, Fred Meijer.
The retail pioneer grew up in
the western Michigan commu-
nity and never forgot it. He died
Friday at age 91, decades after his
father opened a store here that
eventually grew into a Midwest
chain ofnearly 200.
Meijer "loved Greenville and
Greenville loved him," Mayor

Kenneth Snow told The Daily
News.
There will be an eight-hour
visitation tomorrow in Grand
Rapids at the gardens and sculp-
ture park that bears Meijer's
name. He died after suffering a
stroke.
Greenville, 35 miles northeast
of Meijer Inc. headquarters in
Grand Rapids, is where Meijer's
father got into the grocery busi-
ness in 1934. The city's welcome
sign says "Birthplace of Meijer."
Fred Meijer was the lead donor
of an expansion at Spectrum
Health's United Memorial Cam-
pus, which added two surgery
suites and 24 patient rooms and
is named for his parents. Over a
10-year period, he made many
donations to the Fighting Falcon
Military Museum.

"When he heard he could do
something for Greenville, he cer-
tainly would do it," high school
classmate Virginia Wood, 91,
said.
Former Mayor Lloyd Walker, a
longtime friend, recalled accom-
panying Meijer on a personal trip
near Saginaw and stopping to get
an ice cream at a new Meijer store.
Meijer handed out coupons for
free cones and introduced himself
to anyone who wanted to chat.
"If you Googled him, you'd
know he was worth $5.2 billion,"
Walker told The Grand Rapids
Press. "But you'd never know it
from meeting him."
He said he relied on Meijer to
personally ease the concerns of
farmers when Meijer and Green-
ville wanted to create recreation
trails in the area.

Series of bombs kill 15
civilians around Baghdad

Violence prevalent
amid planned exit
of U.S. troops
BAGHDAD, (AP) - A series
of blasts struck an area west of
Baghdad on Saturday where day
laborers gather to find work, as
well as a music and clothes mar-
ket in the capital, killing at least
15 people, officials said.
The second day of major
attacks this week in Iraq
underscored the challenges
still facing the country's secu-
rity forces as they approach a
particularly fragile time. All
American troops are scheduled
to be out of Iraq in a matter of
weeks, leaving Iraqi security
forces with sole responsibility
for securing the country.
The first two bombs exploded
in the early morning in an area
where day laborers wait for work

in the mostly Sunni village of
al-Zaidan, near the town of Abu
Ghraib west of Baghdad. They
killed seven people and wounded
11 others, the officials said.
Hours later, three bombs
exploded near the kiosks of ven-
dors selling CDs and militaryuni-
forms in central Baghdad's Bab
al-Sharqi market district, killing
eight people and wounding19.
"I went outside my shop and
saw people running in all direc-
tions trying to leave the market
area. I saw several bodies and
wounded people on the ground,"
said Mohammed Youssef, who
owns a clothing shop in the area.
Iraqi military commanders
ordered all the vendors selling
products in the area to close their
kiosks and move, in an attempt
to clear out the area and make
it harder for insurgents to hide
bombs.
Healthofficials at Abu Ghraib's
general hospital and at three

hospitals in Baghdad confirmed
the casualty figures. All officials
spoke on condition of anonymity
because they were not authorized
to release the information.
Violence has ebbed across
Iraq, but deadly bombings and
shootings still occur almost daily
as U.S. troops prepare to leave by
the end of the year. Iraqi secu-
rity officials maintain that they
are fully prepared for the with-
drawal, which is required under
a 2008 security pact between the
U.S. and Iraq..
On Thursday, three bombs
struck the southern city of Basra,
killing19 people.
Earlier this week, the top U.S.
general in Iraq, Lloyd Austin,
said that there would likely be
some "turbulence" after Ameri-
can troops depart, as insurgents
try to strengthen their positions.
But he did not think there would
be a wholesale disintegration of
security.

Upgrades to
electrical, heating
and security systems
among renovations
OYSTER BAY, N.Y. (AP) -
Theodore Roosevelt had a lot of
stuff.
There's the massive head of a
2,000-pound African cape buf-
falo hanging over a fireplace near
the front entrance of his home,
Sagamore Hill, on the north
shore of Long Island. Next to a
large desk in the North Room
sits a wastepaper basket made
from the hollowed foot of an
elephant. Nearby, there's an ink-
well crafted from part of a rhino.
More than four dozen rugs made
from bearskins and other crea-
tures taken down by the noted
big game hunter adorn nearly
every room.
There are 8,000 books, and
thousands of items from flags to
furniture, busts to baubles and
medals to mementoes.
Everything must go.
The entire contents of Saga-
more Hill are being packed up
and put in storage as the National
Park Service prepares for a three-

year, $6.2 million renovation of
the 28-room, Queen Anne-Shin-
gle style mansion in Oyster Bay.
The 26th president of the United
States, who had the home built for
him in 1885, lived there until his
death in 1919. He used Sagamore
Hill as a "summer White House"
during his presidency from 1901-
1909.
Workers have already spent
nine months packing books and
other smaller items into boxes,
using special care to catalog
every one and place it on a com-
puter spreadsheet. The three-
story home has 15 bedrooms and
three bathrooms, as well as sit-
ting rooms and offices. It sits on
a nearly 83-acre high atop a hill
overlooking an inlet that leads to
Long Island Sound.
Sagamore Hill, which sees
about 50,000 visitors annually,
closes to the public on Dec. 5 so
craftspeople can begin the heavy
lifting in earnest to rehabilitate
the 1885 home that hasn't seen
any major renovations in more
than a half century. A much
smaller display of Roosevelt
memorabilia - including his
White House china- will remain
on display in a smaller building
on the property throughout the
three-year project.

Plans call for upgrades to the
electrical, heating, security and
fire suppression systems through-
out the home, which has been a
National Park Service historic
site since the early 1960s. Exte-
rior work will include a new roof,
gutter and drainage system, foun-
dation waterproofing, and restora-
tion of 78 historic windows, doors,
porches and siding.
Also to be restored are Saga-
more Hill's original rear porch
and a skylight in the center of the
house, both of which were altered
or removed in the 1950s when
the Theodore Roosevelt Associa-
tion owned the property and first
opened it to public visits. The
association ran Sagamore Hill for
abouta decade before the National
Park Service took over in 1962 - a
somewhat fitting custodian for the
home of the manwho championed
the creation of the national park
system. ,
"Theodore Roosevelt's house
is like anybody else's house," said
Amy Verone, chief of cultural
resources at Sagamore Hill. She
joked, however, that not everyone
tackling a renovation project in
their home has to contend with I
finding a place for 10-foot-ele-
phant tusks adorned with silver
inlays.

NEWS BRIEFS
FLINT
After inn standoff,
ex-convict arrested
for two deaths
Police have arrested an ex-
convict suspected in two homi-
cides in Flint Township after a
standoff lasted more than four
hours in Flint.
Police tell The Flint Journal
that the suspect had a female
hostage at an inn yesterday. Offi-
cers entered the room after hear-
ing a struggle.
The man is a suspect in the
deaths of 78-year-old Charles
Woodson and his daughter,
53-year-old Phyllis Woodson.
Their bodies were discovered
Saturday at a Flint Township
apartment.
Township Police Chief George
Sippert says the standoff lasted
hours because the suspect was
talking to his family by phone at
the same time. Sippert says the
man was trying to control the
situation and doesn't want to
return to prison.

Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican presidential candidates, talk with
former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney at a Republican presidential debate in Washington on Tuesday, Nov. 22.

N.H.'s largest papmerP

Editorial praises
GOP candidate's
ability to 'improve
Washington'
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - New
Hampshire's largest newspa-
per yesterday endorsed former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich in
the 2012 GOP presidential race,
signaling that rival Mitt Romney
isn't the universal favorite and
potentially resetting the contest
before the state's lead-off prima-
ry Jan.10.
"We are in critical need of
the innovative, forward-looking
strategy and positive leadership
that Gingrich has shown he is
capable of providing," The New
Hampshire Union Leader said
in its front-page editorial, which
was as much a promotion of
Gingrich-as a discreet rebuke of
Romney.
"We don't back candidates
based on popularity polls or big-
shot backers. We look for conser-
vatives of courage and conviction
who are independent-minded,
grounded in their core beliefs
about this nation and its people,
and best equipped for the job,"
the editorial said.
Romney enjoys solid leads
in New Hampshire polls and
remains at the front of the pack

nationally. A poll released last
week showed him with 42 per-
cent support amonglikely Repub-
lican primary voters in New
Hampshire. Gingrich followed
with 15 percent in the WMUR-
University of New Hampshire
Granite State poll.
Rep. Ron Paul of Texas post-
ed 12 percent support and for-
mer Utah Gov. John Huntsman
found 8 percent support in that
survey.
Those numbers could shift
based on the backing of The
Union Leader, a newspaper with
a conservative editorial stance
that proudly works to influence
elections, from school boards to
the White House, in the politi-
cally savvy state.
The front page one editorial,
signed by publisher Joseph W.
McQuaid, suggested that the
only state-wide newspaper in
New Hampshire was ready to
again assert itself as a player in
the GOP primary.
"We don't have to agree with
them on every issue," the news-
paper wrote in an editorial that
ran across the width of the front
page. "We would rather back
someone with whom we may
sometimes disagree than one
who tells us what he thinks we
want to hear."
While Romney enjoys solid
support in national polls, the
large pack of Republicans has

shifted all year from candidate to
candidate in search of an alterna-
tive to the former Massachusetts
governor. That led to the rise,
and fall, of potential challengers
such as Huntsman, Rep. Michele
Bachmann of Minnesota and
Texas Gov. Rick Perry.
Yet with six weeks until the
primary, The Union Leader's
move could shuffle the race and
further boost Gingrich. In recent
weeks, he has seen a surge in
some polls as Republicans focus
more closely on deciding which
candidate they consider best
positioned to take on President
Barack Obama.
"A lot of candidates saythey're
going to improve Washington,"
the newspaper wrote. "Newt
Gingrich has actually done that,
and in this race he offers the best
shot of doing it again."
As voters started focusing
more on the race, Gingrich has
turned in solid debate perfor-
mances and found his, stride on
a national stage. He has rebuilt
his campaign after a disastrous
summer that saw many of his top
aides resign en masse and fund-
raising summaries report million
in debt.
In New Hampshire, he
brought on respected tea party
leader Andrew Hemingway to
lead his efforts and his team has
been contacting almost 1,000
voters each day.

Punishments aim
to prevent further
civil unrest
BEIRUT (AP) - In an unprec-
edented move against an Arab
nation, the Arab League yester-
day approved economic sanctions
on Syria to pressure Damascus
to end its deadly suppression of
an 8-month-old uprising against
President Bashar Assad.
But even as world leaders
abandon Assad, the regime has
refused to ease a military assault
on dissent that already has killed
more than 3,500 people. Yes-
terday, Damascus slammed the
sanctions as a betrayal of Arab
solidarity and insisted a foreign
conspiracy was behind the revolt,
all but assuring more bloodshed
will follow.
The sanctions are among the
clearest signs yet of the isolation
Syria is suffering because of the
crackdown. Damascus has long
boasted of being a powerhouse
of Arab nationalism, but Assad
has been abandoned by some
of his closest allies and now his
Arab neighbors. The growing
movement against his regime
could transform some of the most
enduring alliances in the Middle
East and beyond.
At a news conference in Cairo,
Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad
bin Jassim said 19 of the League's
22 member nations approved a
series of tough punishments that
include cutting off transactions
with the Syrian central bank, halt-
ing Arab government funding for
projects in Syria and freezing gov-
ernment assets. Those sanctions
are to take effect immediately.
Other steps, including halting
flights and imposing travel bans
on some, as-yet unnamed Syrian
-officials, will come later after a
committee reviews them. _
"The Syrian people are being'
killed but we don't want this.

Every Syrian official should not
accept killing even one person,"
bin Jassim said. "Power is worth
nothing while you stand as an
enemyto your people."
He added that the League aims
to "to avoid any suffering for the
Syrian people."
Iraq and Lebanon - impor-
tant trading partners for Syria -
abstained from the vote, which
came after Damascus missed an
Arab League deadline to agree to
allow hundreds of observers into
the country as part of a peace deal
Syria agreed to early this month
to end the crisis.
Arab League Secretary Gener-
al Nabil Elaraby said the bloc will
reconsider the sanctions if Syria
carries out the Arab-brokered
plan, which includes pulling
tanks from the streets and ending
violence against civilians.
The regime, however, has
shown no signs of easing its
crackdown, and activist groups
said more than 30 people were
killed Sunday. The death toll was
impossible to confirm. Syria has
banned most foreign journal-
ists and prevented independent
reporting inside the country.
The Local Coordinating Com-
mittees, a coalition of Syrian
activist groups, praised the sanc-
tions but called for a mechanism
to ensure compliance.
"The sanctions leave open the
opportunity for the regime to
commit fraud and strip the sanc-
tions of any substance, thereby
prolonging the suffering of the
Syrian people at the hands of an,
oppressive and brutal regime,"
the group said.
The Arab League move is
the latest in a growing wave of
international pressure push-
ing Damascus to end its crack-
down. The European Union and
the United States already have
imposed sanctions, the League
has suspended Syria's member-
ship and world leaders increas-
ingly are calling on Assad to go.

U.N. conference to decide how
to reduce carbon emissions

Officials to address
how to help poor
countries cope with
climate change
DURBAN, South Africa (AP)
- The U.N.'s top climate official
said yesterday she expects gov-
ernments to make a long-delayed
decision on whether industrial
countries should make further
commitments to reduce emis-
sions of climate-changing green-
house gases.
Amid fresh warnings of cli-
mate-related disasters in the
future, delegates from about 190
countries were gathering in Dur-
ban for a two-week conference
beginning Monday. They hope to
break deadlocks on how to curb
emissions of carbon dioxide and
other pollutants.
Christiana Figueres, head of
the U.N. climate secretariat, said
the stakes for the negotiations
are high, underscored by new
scientific studies.
Under discussion was "noth-
ing short of the most compelling
energy, industrial, behavioral
revolution that humanity has
ever seen," she said.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu
led a rally at a soccer stadium
later yesterday urging negotia-
tors to be more ambitious during
what were expected to be dif-
ficult talks. Unseasonably cold,
windy weather kept the crowd to
a few hundred spectators.
Hopes were scrapped for an

overall treaty governing global
carbon emissions after the col-
lapse of talks at a climate sum-
mit in Copenhagen two years
ago. The "big bang" approach
has been replaced by incremental
efforts to build new institutions
to help shift the global economy
from carbon-intensive ener-
gy generation, industries and
transportation to more climate-
friendly technologies.
But an underlying division
between rich and poor countries
on the future of the 1997 Kyoto
Protocol has stymied the nego-
tiators.
Figueres said she hoped for a
decision on extending emission
reduction commitments under
the Kyoto accord, which has been
postponed for two years. Previ-
ous commitments expire next
year.
"It's a tall order for govern-
ments to face this," but they show
no interest in yet another delay,
she said.
High on the conference agen-
da is the management of a fund
scaling up over the next eight
years to $100 billion annually to
help poor countries cope with
changing climate conditions.
Questions remain how the
money will be governed and dis-
tributed, but more immediately,
how those funds can be gener-
ated from new sources beyond
established development chan-
nels from the West.
Ideas on the table include a
carbon surcharge on internation-
al shipping and on air tickets, and
a levy on international financial

transactions - sometimes called
a Robin Hood tax.
A committee of 40 countries
worked for the past year on
drawing up a plan to adminis-
ter the Green Climate Fund, but
agreement on the final paper was
blocked by the United States and
Saudi Arabia, and the final con-
tentious issues will have to be
thrashed out in Durban.
Todd Stern, the chief U.S. del-
egate, said the negotiations had
been too rushed.
"I am pretty confident that
we're going to be able to work
these things out," he told report-
ers last week, without naming
the problematic issues.
But Figueres said the future of
the Kyoto accord, which calls on
37 wealthy nations to reduce car-
bon emissions 5 percent below
1990 levels by the end of next
year, is the most difficult political
issue that nations face.
"If it were easy we would have
done it years ago," she said.
Poor countries want the
industrial nations to commit to
more cuts for a second period,
saying the protocol is the only
legal instrument ever adopted to
control carbon and other gases
that trap the Earth's heat.
But the wealthy countries,
with growing consensus, say
they cannot carry the burden
alone, and want rapidly develop-
ing countries like China, India,
Brazil and South Africa to join
their own legally binding regime
to slow their emissions growth
and move toward low-carbon
economies.

DPS meeting encourages student cooperation
In an effort to foster transparency, assuage anxieties and discuss
the apparent prevalence of crime on campus the University's
Department of Public Safety held its first public meeting on
Nov. 22. The meeting was an important step toward bridging the gap
between students and DPS and will hopefully encourage a coopera-

What 'security'really looks like

have no idea when the authori-
tative history of post-9/11
America, in all its sadness,
paranoia and
staggering indif-
ference to the
human cost of
war, will be
written. How-
ever, I think I
know what the
jacket art will
look like. NEILL
Even by the MOHAMMAD
embarrassingly
low standards
we've set over the last 10 years, with
150,000 civilian deaths in Iraq -
that's at least 50 Iraqis for every one
American lost on 9/11 - and airport
security measures that increasingly
resemble systematic molestation,
the viral video of the recent police
crackdown at the University of Cali-
fornia, Davis is chilling. The univer-
sity administration asked police to
break up a peaceful, completely non-
violent demonstrationunder the pre-
tense that the protesters hadviolated
a ban on camping on school grounds.
Police officers responded to the
scene in full riot gear, and in a calm
and orderly fashion, proceeded to
douse the protesters in pepper spray
as they sat motionless onthe ground.
True to form, Chancellor Linda
Katehi initially lied about the cir-
cumstances of the riot deployment,
claiming that the police only resort-
ed to pepper spray after they were
surrounded by protesters. once the
video surfaced, Katehi was forced to
recant; she later appeared on "Good
Morning America" to appeal to the
victims to help "start the healing
process and move forward."
Based on their actions, neither
Katehi nor any other implicated
Davis administrators deserve to be
a part of that process, and hope-
fully they'll be forced from office
soon. However, that leaves another

important question unanswered:
Why does Davis, a rural town of
only 30,000 people or so, have a riot
squad in the first place?
The answer, once again, has a
lot to do with 9/11. It's difficult to
adequately describe just how much
money the United States has spent
on the nebulous, ill-defined concept
of "homeland security" since 2001.
The numbers themselves - at least
$30 billion a year in each of the last
10 years - hardly seem adequate.
Much of this spending is granted
by the Department of Homeland
Security to the states, and then
from the states to individual coun-
ties and towns. From the perspec-
tive of local law enforcement,
.Homeland Security might as well
be Scrooge McDuck's money bin.
It's free money that law enforce-
ment can spend on neat toys with-
out having to suffer the various
indignities of the normal budget
process. All it takes is a few magic
words on a grant application, like
"first-responder preparedness," and
anything resembling good sense
immediately vanishes from conver-
sation and is replaced by a nice big
check from the federal government.
That's how officials in Keith
County in the Nebraska panhandle
(population: 8,370) were able to
spend $45,000 on diving equipment
to help terrorist-proof a local reser-
voir. That's why many local police
stations' storage lockers frequently
resemble a deleted scene from the
"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare"
series, with surplus M-14 and M-16
riflesshowing up in places as remote
as Jasper, Fla. (population: 2,000).
That's also why hundreds of small
police and sheriff's departments,
including one in Adrian, Mich., now
have retro-fitted armored person-
nel carriers, whose primary uses
seem to be tearing up city streets.
Harold Peterson, the director of
emergency management in Keith

County, told the Los Angeles Times
earlier this year that "it's impor-
tant to understand the homeland
security equipment wasn't bought
to be tucked away for the day there
would be some terrorism event."
Of course it wasn't - not when you
could be using it to play soldier and
intimidate innocent civilians. This
summer, the Department of Educa-
tion used its militarized police force
to execute a no-knock warrant in
Stockton, Calif. After three young
children had been dragged out of
bed and into a waiting patrol car, it
turned out that the SWAT team was
at the wrong address.
Why does Davis
have a riot squad
in the first place?
In a way, the student demon-
strators in Davis were lucky. The
unprovoked pepper spray attack
was vicious but certainly prefer-
able to being flattened by an APC.
Next time, though, they might not
be so lucky. The Federal Aviation
Administration is expected to adopt
new rules this January that allow
civilian agencies to purchase and
operate drone aircrafts. The same
technology that's been terrorizing
the Afghan countryside will soon be
available to every small-town sher-
iff with a Rambo complex right here
at home.
I hope that someone is able to a
snap a picture of the first Predator
look-alike used to attack protest-
ers from overhead. It would make a
heck of a book cover.

tive future relationship.
At the meeting, DPS Chief Greg O'Dell
explained that overall crime rates have
declined 30 percent since last year, but aggra-
vated assaults and robberies have increased.
He also said that despite the string of sexual
assaults this summer, the number of reported
sexual assaults has decreased by 42 percent
since last year. These statistics as well as dis-
cussions of other types of crime such as arson,
larceny and motor vehicle theft were dis-
cussed at the meeting.
Opening DPS meetings to the public will
create transparency in law enforcement
actions. Some University students have ques-
tioned the safety of Ann Arbor as crime has
become more apparent. The statistics provid-
ed at the meeting paint a realistic picture of
crime on campus, and this knowledge allows
students to react effectively to and understand
,the incidents.
Though the meeting proved to be success-
ful, the time and date likely caused a low
attendance rate. Many students have morn-
ing classes, so holding the meeting at 8:30 a.m.
is not the best way to encourage attendance.
The first meeting was also held the Tuesday
before Thanksgiving when many students
had already left campus. With only two stu-
dents ttendinglthe first meeting, thelevel of

student involvement is not ideal. In the future,
DPS should schedule the meetings at a more
convenient time for students.
DPS plans to continue hosting public meet-
ings, but it's not only DPS's responsibility to
make these meetings effective. Students need
to attend the meetings and actively partici-
pate in discussions. By asking questions and
engaging in conversation, University students
will become involved in safety issues on and
near campus. Students need to learn how to
remain safe, respond to crime alerts and seek
help if needed.
The public crime meetings are a beneficial
way to build a relationship between students
and law enforcement officers. Future meet-
ings will encourage students to take an active
role in creating a safe environment on and
around campus.
Students must take the initiative to attend
the DPS meetings and contribute ideas for
the way officers respond to and addresses
crime. Creating a safe environment on cam-
pus is an effort that requires students and
police officers to work together. Student
attendance at DPS meetings can help form a
cooperative relationship with police officials
that can help foster a safe campus environ-
ment in the future.

Protect students around A2

The University's Department of Public
Safety opened its weekly crime meeting to
the general public this past Tuesday in order
to promote transparency and allow commu-
nity members to raise their concerns regard-
ing campus safety. We decided to attend this
meeting due to a recent experience with
assault - directly for one of us and indirectly
for the other - that resulted in a broken nose,
maxillary sinus fracture and a sudden sense
of vulnerability. We wanted to know whythe
University hadn't paid more attention to the
incident by alerting other University stu-
dents about the assault.
It turns out that DPS deals solely with
crimes that take place on campus property.
If a student takes a single step off campus
and becomes the victim of a crime, it is no
longer the responsibility of the University to
even so much as inform the student body as
to what happened. DPS decides whether or
not a crime alert will be sent out based on its
own subjective analysis of the severity of the
situation. We are misled to believe that crime
alerts are sent out for all crimes that occur
against University students, as several alerts
have been sent out for crimes that have not
occurred on campus property.
The fact is, student security is not an on-
or off-campus issue. More than half of Uni-
versity students live off campus. University
students study off campus, they eat and drink
off campus and they live off campus - their
world does not end where the physical cam-
pus ends. The campus police exist to protect
students, so we are asking them to protect
students by informing students.
If the University Police do not have the

capacity to alert students of crimes that are
occurring to students off campus, this needs
to be clearly stated, and students need to be
aware that they are not receiving the full
story. DPS should at least keep statistics of
crimes that happen to students in the Ann
Arbor area and send this data to students on
a regular basis.
As is, the current system provides the false
impression that students are being informed
of incidents, and this lack of information pro-
motes a false sense of security. The Univer-
sity needs to be honest with students about
the rates of crime in order to increase aware-
ness and empower students to push for poli-
cies that will make Ann Arbor as a whole a
safer place to live. There is no reason why
cabs should not be available downtown late
at night without a phone call to the cab com-
pany and a long wait. There is no reason why
the University cannot use its buses to estab-
lish a taxi system of its own that will trans-
port students to their homes from coffee
shops or bars after a certain hour.
The University has an obligation to care
for its students and to look out for their safe-
ty and well-being. This obligation certainly
extends beyond the campus. We cannot
change the state of safety on and off campus
unless students are knowledgeable about the
information they are and aren't being given.
Here we thought that we were all Wolver-
ines - it's news to us that when it comes to
your safety, it matters where exactly you are
a Wolverine.

Protect professors who have the
courage to stand up to authority
TO THE DAILY:
Dear The Michigan Daily,
Congratulations onyour raisinginterestinand cover-
age of the elections to the Department of Public Safety
Oversight Committee, a topic that had fallen sadly into
disregard for some years, to the detriment of both stu-
dents and faculty. It is impeccable timing on your part
that students have revitalized their interest in DPS over-
sight just as University of California campuses - Berke-
ley and, horrifically, Davis so far - facea mounting wave
of university-sanctioned violent reaction to peaceful
protests on public school campuses.
It is important that those on the DPS Oversight
Committee guard preemptively against such violent
reactions on the part of the University's DPS, and you
call upon administrators responsible for DPS to state
unequivocally before things reach a boiling point here
that such reactions will not be tolerated at the Univer-
sity of Michigan.
In a similarvein, please support faculty such as UC-
Davis's Nathan Brown, the faculty organizer of the
protest which was attacked, who wrote a courageous,
personal open letter criticizing the role of Chancellor
Learn about the rave scene
before making judgements
TO THE DAILY:
I am writing in response to Leah Potkin's article
"Don't 'rave' about drugs," as I feel that she may have
some gross misconceptions in accordance with what
the rave scene is all about.
I would first like to state that she does a very good
job in describing the dangers that accompany the
usage of 'rave' drugs. As an active participant in the
rave scene for almost two and a half years, I have wit-
nessed far too many people end up in dangerous situ-
ations because of their lack of judgment in relation to
narcotic usage. Drug usage is a sad side effect of the
scene, but it is far from the defining essence of what
makes electronic dance music so popular with today's
youth.
Where I take exception with Potkin's piece is when
she asserts that we, as members of the rave scene,
feel it necessary to take illegal narcotics in order to
"appreciate the music" that DJs play to "cater to their
drugged-out audiences." I feel comfortable speak-
ing for the rave crew, which I am a part of, when I say
that we have a great appreciation for the music sans
rave drugs. Many of us, myself included, actively write
about the music we listen to and the concerts we go
to for music blogs and music publications. We love the
music for the music, not because it's an excuse to "roll
face." In fact, I'm listening to one of Avicii's newest


SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM
Linda Katehi - former University of Michigan electri-
cal engineering and computer science professor - in
the pepper-spraying and clubbing of peaceful protest-
ers on campus, and calling for her immediate resigna-
tion as has the Board of the Davis Faculty Association.
I say courageous because Brown is an untenured assis-
tant English professor at UC-Davis, and it has woefully
happened manytimes inthe pastthat criticswithoutthe
protection of tenure have suffered reprisals - even to
the point of dismissal at institutions of the caliber of UC-
Davis - for actions of far less public declat.
Just as with your timely position on DPS, I encourage
you to getout in front by casting the spotlight on the case
of Nathan Brown - lest athoughtful and passionate fac-
ulty defender of the right to free expression on campus
be sanctioned by an embarrassed administration which
has lost the confidence of its student body and faculty.
The University of Michigan American Association
of University Professors is calling upon faculty every-
where to maintain a vigil of protection around Brown
in the name of academic freedom and the faculty's right
to share in university governance. We would appreciate
any help we can get from students who agree with the
need to protect faculty leaders like Brown.

songs as I write this letter. It is not rave drugs that are
"taking center stage" at concerts around the world. It
is the feeling of love, togetherness and pure happiness
that accompanies a four-hour dance party.
EDM is aboutgoing with your best friends to a place
where you can listen to music that makes you happy
and jump around likea lunatic for hours on end free of
judgment. Concerts are settings in which thousands of
people really do "dance like no one is watching," and
some of the best moments of my life have been realized
at the very raves Potkin presents as breeding grounds
for drug addiction.
Merriam-Webster defines ecstasy as "a state of
overwhelmingemotion; especially: rapturous delight."
To me that definition represents every time I get to go
see a show with the people who appreciate the music
as much as I do. I have never left a rave without a smile
on my face, and I've never left one in an ambulance like
many students do at fraternity parties, house parties
or one of the many bars on campus. The rave scene has
its abusers, but so does the alcohol scene, and alcohol is
far more prevalent on campus than raving ever will be.
I, in no way, condone the usage of rave drugs, but
before trashing the entire EDM scene as a public dan-
ger, I wish Potkin would have asked those of us who
actually partake in it regularly how we feel. Better yet,
she should come rave with us and see for herself first-
hand what it's all about - the more the merrier. We
aren't all evil people, I swear.

beats U in Blood Battle

With 2,628 pints
of blood, the 'U'
collected 200 more
than Ohio State
By CLAIRE GOSCICKI
Daily StaffReporter
The University's weekend
victory over The Ohio State
University goes beyond the
football field.
For the fourth consecutive
year, the University beat OSU in
the annual Blood Battle compe-
tition. The University collected
2,628 pints of blood - about 200
more pints than OSU - during
the two-week contest, which
ended Saturday. The University
also beat OSU in this semester's
Wolverine-Buckeye Challenge

for Life, a donor registration
drive competition sponsored
by Gift of Life Michigan, by
registering about 49,000 more
donors than OSU.
The University chapter of
Alpha Phi Omega, a co-ed com-
munity service fraternity and
the sponsor of Blood Battle,
sought to encourage as many
people on campus to donate
blood to surpass its initial goal of
2,550 pints, said LSA senior Jes-
sie Baker, the Blood Battle chair.
"We wanted to beat OSU, but
our main goal was to collect
blood to save lives," she said.
Blood donation stations -
which were sponsored by the
American Red Cross - were
scattered around campus in
locations including the Michi-
gan Union, Michigan Stadium
and several residence halls.
Baker said promotion of

the event around the Diag and
through local fundraisers led to
a strong turnout at the drives.
She added that she and other
organizers are excited about
the progress that was made by
both schools in the Blood Bat-
tle, especially because there is a
greater need for blood - about
100 more pints than OSU - dur-
ing the holiday season.
"People don't donate during
the holidays, because they're
not around, and (therefore) the
demand is so great," Baker said.
Anne Murphy, an adminis-
trator at the University Hospi-
tal Transplant Center, said that
like the need for blood, there is
also a high demand in the state
for organ, tissue and bone mar-
row donors.
According to University of
Michigan Health System sta-
tistics, each day 19 people die

while waiting for an organ
transplant.
"We always have a shortage
of donors," Murphy said. "Right
now they're about 3,000 people
in the state of Michigan waiting
for organ transplants."
The Wolverine-Buckeye
Challenge placed the University
and Ohio State in competition
to see which school could gen-
erate the greater number of new
organ, tissue and bone marrow
donors during the 2011 college
football season. The Univer-
sity helped to generate about
109,000 new donor list regis-
trants through the Michigan
Donor Registry, beating Ohio
State's approximately 60,000
new registrants for the second
year in a row, according to Mur-
phy.

Rushing the field is
technically against
Big House policy
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily Staff Reporter
Apart from rushing the field
after the Wolverines' 40-34 win
against the Buckeyes on Satur-
day, Michigan fans at the Big
House remained relatively tame
as they watched the Wolverines
beat Ohio State for the first time
in seven seasons.
Diane Brown, spokeswoman
for the University's Department
of Public Safety, said that consid-
ering the animosity between the
Wolverines and the Buckeyes,
fans were fairly calm on Saturday.
"Indeed this was a high rival-
ry game, and as a result it was a
very large crowd, and it also does
tend to draw out unsportsman-
like behavior that sometimes will
cross lines into criminal activity,
such as assault and battery and
disorderly conduct," Brown said.
"However, for all of those people
that were there and as intense as
the game was, it was a fairly, rea-
sonably well-behaved crowd."
Out of a crowd of 114,132 peo-
ple, five were arrested, seven
were issued citations and 38 were
ejected from the stadium during
the game, according to Brown.
Two of the arrests were for
minor in possession of alcohol,
one for disorderly conduct, one
for resisting a police officer and
one for possessing what was sus-
pected to be marijuana, accord-
ing to Brown. Five people were
issued citations for possessing
alcohol, one for using someone
else's identification and another
for urinating in public. Of the 38
people ejected from the stadium,
17 were asked to leave for using
another person's ID, 16 for alco-
hol possession, four for disorderly
conduct and one for violating sta-
dium rules.
In addition to the disorderly
conduct, 87 people were treated
by emergency medical personnel,
15 of whom were taken to the hos-
pital, according to Brown.
Many of the crime incidents on
Saturday involved students, but
the number of students who were
actually arrested, cited or ejected
has not been made public, Brown
said. She added that crime inci-

dents at the Big House are always
higher at Ohio State games than
at games against other oppo-
nents.
"It's a very potent rivalry,"
Brown said.
However, rivalry games
including the Sept. 10 night game
against Notre Dame saw a similar
number of crimes. At the Sept.10
game there were 14 arrests, seven
citations and 20 ejections from
the Big House.
In lapse of adherence to pub-
lie safety, thousands of people
took to the field en masse after
the Wolverines' victory on Sat-
urday, violating a stadium rule
that states "unauthorized entry
onto the playing field before,
during or after the game is pro-
hibited," according to mgoblue.
com. However, there were no
arrests of fans who hopped over
the railings.
Officials were no more con-
cerned about fans rushing the-
field for the Ohio State game than
for any other, Brown said. For
that reason, public safety officials
always have a strategy should
fans choose to rush the field. The
strategy allows fans to rush the
field, but does not allow fans near
the goalposts. Officials could be
seen guarding the goalposts after
Saturday's game.
"We always have to have a
variety of emergency plans in
place for a variety of emergencies
... includingsuch things as people
enteringthe field," Brown said.
The last time fans rushed the
field at the Big House was in 2003
after the Wolverines' last victory
over the Buckeyes.

MSA to host student government
conference for colleges across Mich.

Governments to
discuss ways to
increase student
voter registration
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Though the Michigan Stu-
dent Assembly's main focus is
on University issues, it plans to
extend its reach to the state of
Michigan.
MSA will host the Student
Association of Michigan con-
ference this weekend in the
* Michigan Union, where col-
lege student governments from
across the state will meet to
discuss how to increase student
voter registration and SAM's
future events.
Started in 2007, SAM is com-
prised of the student govern-
ments of Michigan's 15 public
universities and represents
more than 300,000 students in
the state. The conferences occur
every month except in Decem-
ber and once every three months
in the summer. Each school
sends a delegation from their
student government.
By bringing student repre-
sentatives together, the group

works to address problems on a
broader scale and pass measures
agreed on by all 15 schools.
"We are representing the
entire state of Michigan," MSA
President DeAndree Watson
said. "That's really when you
get action from the state legis-
lature."
At last month's SAM con-
ference, MSA sponsored and
helped pass a resolution in sup-
port of bill in the Michigan
Senate, which requires school
districts to make policies to dis-
courage bullying.
Watson said the assembly
previously passed a similar reso-
lution, but the resolution is not
as effective as the one passed
by SAM. To make the resolution
known, copies of it will be sent
to the media, Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder, Michigan legisla-
tors and state university regents
and presidents.
Independently, MSA doesn't
usually address state-level
issues because it lacks the power
and resources to have a large
influence, Watson said.
"As a student government,
we kind of throw our hands up
because we don't ... really make
a lasting impact," he said. "But
with an organization like SAM
that represents all 15 public uni-
versities, you have a body that

really represents (the students
of) Michigan."
Watson said SAM also recent-
ly discussed an initiative to reg-
ister 30,000 Michigan college
students to vote by February
2012. To reach this goal, SAM
will start a friendly competition
among universities to see which
school can register the most stu-
dents.
At their weekend-longconfer-
once this week, SAM members
will also plan its Advocacy Event
- a rally in Lansing in March. In
addition to raising awareness
about student issues during the
rally, SAM hopes to meet with
state legislators one-on-one to
discuss funding reductions to
higher education.
One of SAM's most important
goals is to correct "extraordi-
nary cuts to education," accord-
ing to Sean Wasler, LSA junior
and chair of MSA's external
relations commission. The state
decreased higher education
appropriations by 15 percent, or
$225 million, for the current fis-
cal year.
While MSA was not actively
involved in SAM in the last few
years, Watson said the assembly
is recommitted to SAM's suc-
cess.
"We've begun to realize that
SAM is important and that in

order to have a strong student
voice in the state of Michigan,
you need a strong SAM," he said.
Walser added that SAM has
recently gained stability and a
better sense of direction.
"SAM in the past has not done
as much as it could," Walser
said. "But it's really on the right
path now, and it has solid leader-
ship that's making it very worth-
while to be a member."
Nevertheless, not every stu-
dent government is on the samex
page, Walser said.
The student governments of
Eastern Michigan University,
Central Michigan University
and the University of Michigan-
Dearborn were all absent at last
month's conference, according
to Sathi.
"They saw the early stages of
SAM," Sathi said. "They didn't
see how it was going benefit
their school."
Sathi and Walser said they
planned to call each of the stu-
dent government presidents rep-
resented by SAM to encourage
participation at this weekend's
conference.
"If they were to have the
opportunity to see this progress,
I think they may change their
mind and start attending SAM
conferences once again," Sathi
said.

Democrats, labor
unions circulate
petitions for recall
MADISON, Wis. (AP) -
Embattled Wisconsin Gov. Scott
Walker may not face a recall
vote until next summer, but he's
already campaigning to keep his
job in the face of a major chal-
lenge by organized labor and the
Democratic Party.
With petitions for a recall elec-
tion now circulating, Walker is
running television advertising
defending his record during his
first 11 months in office. Soon,
Republican volunteers will begin
going door to door, making phone
calls and writing letters to the
editor arguing that his most
controversial initiative, which
stripped public employee unions
of most of their bargaining rights,
was justified by the state's fiscal
problems.
The Walker recall effort,which
will be one of the most fierce-
ly contested races in the 2012
national campaign, will serve as
a gauge of the public's support for
confrontational measures used by
new Republican governors to bal-

ance state budgets. In only two
weeks, petitioners here are on
pace to gather more than enough
signatures to put Walker on the
ballot against a yet-to-be-deter-
mined opponent.
Walker's backers are trying to
take lessons from the only two
successful gubernatorial recalls
in U.S. history - against Califor-
nia Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 and
North Dakota Gov. Lynn Frazier
in 1921.
Those governors were too slow
to fight back, said David Schecter,
a political scientist at California
State University, Fresno, who has
studied recall campaigns. Their
races were mostly lost before the
signatures were submitted.
"There's this momentum that
builds and once it builds it's very
difficult for things to reverse,"
Schecter said. "The signature
stage is really the election before
the election. In that stage, vot-
ers are letting their choices be
known."
Walker will try to stop the
recall election, or delay it for
months, by challenging the valid-
ity of signatures that must be
turned in by Jan. 17. Recall sup-
porters must gather 540,000
names of registered voters.

'Muppets'mnaendure

Jason Segel revives
a beloved franchise
for a new generation
By KAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
Senior Arts Editor
These have been dark and dif-
ficult times, Kermit the Frog.
With 15 years since the last semi-
commercially
successful *
Muppet feature
("Muppet Trea- The
sure Island")
and appear- Muppets
ances limited
to a handful At Quaityl16
of blink-and- and Rave
you-miss-it TV Disney
specials, the
Muppets had
nearly evaporated from cultural
relevancy. Entire generations
have never been swooned by the
banjo-plucking of the amphibian
with the angelic voice and asso-
ciate Fozzie Bear's catchphrase
"waka waka" with Shakira's
World Cup anthem (or confuse it
with the Atlanta rapper).
But the Rainbow Connection
has been restored with the release
of "The Muppets," willed to life
by Jason Segel (TV's "How IMet
Your Mother") and continuing
Disney's venerable tradition of
handing the creative reigns to
filmmakers who are passionate
about the material they're bring-
ing to screen. Segel is quite the
ardent Muppet aficionado, and
as co-writer, executive producer
and star, he pours every drop of
his adoration for the Jim Henson
creations into this movie. And it
all pays off - Segel's exuberance
seeps into every second of "The
Muppets," carving a delicious
family filmthat proves Kermit and
his felt crew still got it going on.
The key to the Muppets' sto-
ried success had always been

their remarkable ability to shift
between humor aimed at kids
and adults without trepidation.
The involvement of Segel and co-
writer Nicholas Stoller - whose
last script was the raunch-tastic
"Forgetting Sarah Marshall" -
may have raised eyebrows, but the
duo nails the balance. For every
gag about "fart shoes" and elec-
trocuted puppets that will have
tykes soiling their Pull-Ups with
laughter, there's sharp self-reflex-
ive humor, carefully positioned
Muppets references and a flurry
of delightful celebrity cameos for
everyone else. If you're the type
of adult who thinks fart shoes are
hilarious - and you're not alone -
then get ready to snicker until the
credits roll.
As for the sweetly silly musical
numbers - the enchantment of
elaborately choreographed sing-
ing and dancing transcends age
and maturity. Under the direction
of James Bobin, who wrote the

book on staging songs that rapidly
flicker between introspective and
irreverent with TV's "Flight of the
Conchords," the musical numbers
give the film a shot in the arm
whenever the plot stagnates.
And the swampy narrative is
where the warts of "The Mup-
pets"become evident. Though the
film has a neat beginning, follow-
ing the trip of Gary (Segel), Mary
(Amy Adams, "The Fighter") and
Gary's brother Walter (a puppet)
to visit the now-ramshackle Mup-
pet Studio - the home of Wal-
ter's idols - it quickly falls into a
let's-get-the-band-back-together-
and-put-on-a-big-show "Blues
Brothers" ripoff. It's lazy story-
telling, even by kid's standards,
and further hampered by lame
subplots (see: Animal recovering
from his "drum" addiction).
But these imperfections are
glossed over by the joyfully spir-
ited cast. Kermit, Miss Piggy,
Fozzie, Gonzo, Swedish Chef,

Beaker, Sam Eagle and the rest
are at the top of their games. And
they're accompanied by Segel,
who's clearly having the time of
his life, the everlastingly lovely
Amy Adams (belting out her
soprano for the first time since
"Enchanted") and the cadre of
cameos too cool to be spoiled. Yet
Hollywood's resident scene-steal-
er, Chris Cooper ("The Company
Men") pilfers another motion pic-
ture, playing an evil Texas oilman
with enough ham to cause a state
of emergency in a synagogue (the
dude raps, for God's sake).
The plot might be croaky, but
the audience's enjoyment of this
film is testament to the allure of
the Muppets: The nostalgia and
wit of the characters will always
transcend narrative shortcom-
ings. With the might of the Mouse
House marketing machine behind
them, the Electric Mayhem Bus
should keep rolling on to great
things.

Mesmerizing 'Marilyn'

Super nostalgia
for Nintendo

'My Week with
Marilyn' adds depth
to the 1950s icon
By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer
Once in a generation, there
comes an actor who redefines
what it means to be famous - a
celebrity whose
name is synony-
mous with show *
business, whose yWeek
face graces the
walls of every Man
household and At the

nature instantly The Weinstein
makes him or Company
her a muse and
an inspiration.
Marilyn Monroe, without a doubt,
was one such actor.
Whimsical, flirtatious and
elusive, Monroe was the dream
of men and the envy of their
wives. But that's not what "My
Week with Marilyn" is about.
Yes, it tells the story of a young
man named Colin Clark (Eddie
Redmayne, "The Other Boleyn
Girl") who is besotted with
Monroe's (Michelle Williams,
"Blue Valentine") effortless
charm. But more important-
ly, the film reveals the flawed
human behind a name not often
associated with flaws - a girl
with a troubled childhood who
just wants to walk in the park
like a normal person.
That girl is not what Law-
rence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh,
"Valkyrie") expects when he
decides to hire Monroe for his
upcoming film. Having replaced
his wife Vivian Leigh (Julia
Ormond, "The Curious Case
of Benjamin Button") with the

Monroe ponders going brunette.
younger, more vivacious Mon-
roe, Olivier wants his light
comedy to catapult him into
superstardom. He wants Mon-
roe to do what she always does
- be sexy. Monroe, on the con-
trary, is a superstar who wants
to be known as an actress. She
wants this film to be more than a
superficial comedy, and this dif-
ference iri opinion yields numer-
ous uneasy days on set that make
Monroe ever more fragile.
The only person whose com-
pany she finds comforting is
the enthusiastic Clark - a third
assistant director who is already
enchanted and infatuated by
her presence. It's clear from the
beginning that their relationship
doesn't have a happy ending, but
the times they spendtogether peel
away layer after layer of Monroe's
unyielding exterior and give us a
glimpse into the perils of being
famous.
When they're together in her

THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY

bedroom one night, she com-
ments on how lucky Clark is to
have a family that loves him.
For the first time, we're made to
grasp the unsettling nature of
her childhood and subsequently
her constant yearning to be loved
and cared for. The more time they
spend together, the more we real-
ize how tiring it must have been
for Marilyn Monroe to perpetu-
ally be expected to be a glamorous
movie star, when she really just
wanted to be normal.
Williams plays Monroe -
externally formidable yet inter-
nally vulnerable - with riveting
ease. When she sings and dances,
one is reminded why Monroe was
so bewitching. When she breaks,
we're reminded of Monroe's bat-
tle with fame and her desire to be
understood. It's too soon to say,
but she might just walk away with
an Academy Award.
The more unexpected yet
pleasantly surprising perfor-

mance, however, comes from Red-
mayne. His internal conflict about
being with a married woman and
youthful disregard for conven-
tions are unnerving. It's unfortu-
nate that the film didn't explore
his character as thoroughly as
Monroe. Then again, none of the
other characters were touched
upon with as much devotion and
affection. It goes to show that
Monroe demands as much admi-
ration today as she did 50 years
ago.
Despite these minor flaws, it's
hard to believe that this is director
Simon Curtis's (TV's "Cranford")
first feature. It's not easy to make
the most famous face in the world
so human, and Curtis's Monroe is
fascinating and fragile.
"My Week with Marilyn" is a
humorous, graceful depiction of
how fame and glamor blind us so
thoroughly that we rarely try to
look past the celebrity and com-
prehend the person beneath.

But there's only so much par-
kour to pull off with Ezio, and so
many Covenant forces to shatter
with a Gravity Hammer before
all the virtual carnage melds
together in a banal blur and the
experiences board a Greyhound
to WhoGivesAShitville. Then
there's the suffocating com-
plexity of today's productions
- secondary objectives, special
achievements, collection esca-
pades and online play have made
the already-shallow experience
even more time wasting (also
known as first world guilt exac-
erbation). That's why every time
I turn around, I'm back in love
again with the Super Nintendo.
Admittedly, much of my rever-
ence for the system is driven by
nostalgia. My parents brought
a Super Nintendo to the Pandey
home one night in 1995, which
led to glorious nights crowded
around the television, passing
around the controller as we each
tried to tackle levels in "Donkey
Kong Country" - rampaging
through fools on Rambi the Rhi-
noceros, commissioningFunky
Kong for airctravel and crushing
Kremlin craniums (Mom could
school us in "Jungle Hijinks" all
day, everyday). Once final boss
King K. Rool was conquered, the

Super Nintendo gameplay con-
tinued with the "Donkey Kong"
sequels, "Aladdin," "Phantom
2040," "The Jungle Book" and so
many more.
But beyond nostalgia, no mod-
ern console has provided as much
of a maddening challenge as the
Super Nintendo. "Left for Dead
2"? No sweat. "Resident Evil 5"?
Done-zo. But my sister and I have
been hovering around 30-per-
cent completion on our replay of
"Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy
Kong's Quest" for almost a year
now. I couldn't even defeat the
first boss in my recently acquired
copy of "Super Star Wars" (a sand
monster), and my roommate, the
Super Nintendo-extraordinaire,
gave up after level three's Jawa
Sandcrawler.
And with great difficulty
comes great satisfaction. In
"Donkey Kong," there's nothing
like the breathless euphoria of
reaching the star-barrel halfway
checkpoint or the nervous elation
of collectingthe "G" in "KONG,"
realizing you've almost made it
It's on like
Donkey Kong.
to the end of the damn level but
remembering the final obstacle is
always psychotically difficult.
This return to old school,
simple gaming also pervades my
school life. My roommates and I
have two Xbox 360s, a Wii and a
PlayStation 2 in our house (and
those are just the consoles we
brought to school), yet we crowd
around the living room and play
"Super Smash Bros." on the Nin-
tendo 64 to a worrisome amount
each day.
Attempts were made to tran-
sition to new iterations of the
"Super Smash Bros." franchise
onthe GameCube and WVbuttit
soon became obvious thereas
no matchingthe streamlined,
fluid mechanics of the origi-
nal. One of life's little-known
pleasures is the sheer ecstasy of
leaping off the level with Captain
Falcon and pressingthe "Down"
and "A" buttons at the precise
moment as your enemy isreturn-
ing to the stage, plummeting
them to an inescapable grave and
hearing their incredulous whim-
pers of how unfair the maneuver
was.
So Santa Claus, this year you

Senior forward David Wohlberg, who tallied a goal, hadn't registered a point since an Oct. 28 matchup with Ferris State.
Union pelts Mchigan in
inaugural meeti ngat Yost

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
Chris Brown believes that
adversity reveals character, it
doesn't
define it. UNION (NY) 6
This may MICHIGAN 3
be the case.
But the junior forward for the No.
11 Michigan hockey team would
surely rather not play with so
much adversity.
Michigan (3-5-2 CCHA, 7-7-2
overall) dropped its sixth con-
secutive game Sunday afternoon
to No. 13 Union, 6-3, following Fri-
day night's 4-1 defeat at the hands
of Northeastern.
"We've got to work harder,"
Brown said. "We can't do any-
thing different. It's not our goalie,
(defense), forwards (or) coaching.
It's just the will to win a game and
right now we don't have it."
Brown didn't blame Michigan's
recent struggles on one particu-
lar unit, but this weekend shone
a spotlight on a struggling defen-
sive corps. Union came into the
matchup boasting the fifth-best
power play in the country. So
"when Michigan took a slashing
penalty eight minutes into the first
period, it only took 11 seconds for
the Dutchmen to find the back of
the net.

The Wolverines' defense just
stood by idly.
"Our defense was getting
trapped," said Michigan coach
Red Berenson. "When you're play-
ing well, the mistakes get over-
looked and somebody makes up
for you. Right now, every mistake
we make shows up on the score-
board."
Defensive mistakes kept com-
ing. Two minutes after Union's
first goal, freshman defenseman
Brennan Serville lost control of the
puck when he tried to clear it away
from Michigan's net. A Dutch-
man recovered it and whizzed
a slapshot past fifth-year senior
goaltender Shawn Hunwick.
Breakaways - like the ones
that caused two Union goals -
meant that Hunwick was the
only Wolverine standing between
the Dutchmen and the net. It's a
tough situation for Berenson, who
knows that Hunwick won't be able
to block every shot.
"I think there's the odd save
(Hunwick) can make," Berenson
said. "Right now, Hunwick's in
sync with our team (but) it's just
not working."
Michigan only responded to the
Dutchmen with three goals. Some
of the goals were smart, like soph-
omore defenseman Mac Bennett's
long dish across the ice to fresh-

man forward Alex Guptill.
Others were luck, like when
senior forward David Wohlberg
found the loose puck among a pile
of skaters in front of Union's net.
But the offensive plays were
overshadowed each time the
Dutchmen scored.
The defensive woes were
almost exact replicas to the ones
the Wolverines saw Friday night
against Northeastern (3-7-2 HEA,
4-7-2), and it's not easy for the
players to see the same mistakes
being made every game.
"You could say it's kind of a
snowball effect," Brown said.
"One thing happens and then
another, and that's why they're
scoringgoals."
The defensive problems are
frustrating for senior defensemen
Greg Pateryn.
As the leader of the defensive
unit, Pateryn is charged with get-
ting the rest of the corps motivat-
ed every game.
"Guys are only giving a full 60
minutes every five minutes or so,"
Pateryn said. "(As a captain) you
have to go out there every single
shift and show them what you
have to do."
Added Brown: "It's time to
grow up. Time to play like a man
and (play) Michigan hockey. This
is not Michigan hockey."

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Editor
Most basketball fans know
that Michigan sophomore guard
Tim Hardaway Jr.'s father is a
former NBA star - having played
professionally for 14 years, most
of which with the Golden State
Warriors and Miami Heat.
And ever since Hardaway Jr.
broke out during the second half
of last season and helped lead
the Michigan basketball team to
a surprise NCAA Tournament
berth, he's seemed destined to
become the second in his family
to play in the NBA.
Based on past high school
rankings, this would be a sur-
prise - Hardaway Jr. was not
considered an elite recruit, and
he didn't pick up offers from top-
25 programs until long after he
had already committed to the
Wolverines. But the Miami, Fla.
native was the team's leading
scorer in Big Ten play last season,
averaging 14.9 points per game.
Hardaway Jr. is averaging
17.3 points this season, and in
an exclusive interview with The
Michigan Daily at the Maui Invi-
tational, ESPN NBA Draft ana-
lyst Chad Ford said he's noticed
improvements in the guard's
game.
"I think Hardaway Jr. has
improved from when I saw him
as a freshman," Ford said. "Main-
ly that goes with shot selection,
which is natural. You're used to
being the man in high school, and
then making that jump is a pretty
big jump. ... You clearly saw last
year he was talented, but you
cringed at some of the shots he
would take."
Last summer, Hardaway Jr.
- in preparation for a new role
as Michigan's go-to scorer in the
wake of point guard Darius Mor-
ris's early departure to the NBA
- worked on the areas of the
game he felt were lacking, specifi-
cally ball handling and mid-range
shooting. The goal was to become
more well-rounded, improving
in areas other than his already-
established ability to knock down
the 3-pointer. It also would make
Hardaway Jr. more of a weapon
on the ball screens that are so

critical to Michigan coach John
Beilein's offense and that Morris
thrived on as the team's leading
scorer a year ago.
So far, the work seems to have
paid off. Just 26.2 percent of
Hardaway Jr.'s points have come
from 3-pointers, whereas last
season that figure was 47 percent.
And Ford said that it isn't a huge
issue that Hardaway Jr. is a bit of
a tweener between the "two" and
"three" positions, since in the
NBA the difference between the
positions is largely inconsequen-
tial. Hardaway Jr. also played in
the FIBA U19 World Champion-
ships last July, scoring 21 points
in the final game against Austra-
lia and clinching fifth place for
Team USA.
"I think the Team USA expe-
rience has helped him as well,"
Ford said. "I feel like he's a lot
more poised."
But the analystsays the sopho-
more still has more to work on.
"He's got good size for his posi-
tion, he's athletic, he can shoot
the basketball, and he can put the
ball on the floor, get to the bas-
ket," Ford said. "He's got a lot of
the tools that you sort of look for
in a wing. If he was a better ball-
handler - and it's ironic, because
his dad was amazing - that's
probably his biggest weakness. I
think he (also) needs to get a lit-
tle more consistent from 3-point
range.
"ButI think he's a pro."
Ford said Hardaway Jr. isn't
currently considered afirst-round
prospect, but if he and Michigan

have a big year and he returns for
his junior season, his draft stock
could rise to that status. But Ford
said that his ceiling isn'tcthatchigh
and thatcbeing alottery pick prob-
ably isn't in the cards, saying that
most scouts and general manag-
ers don't see Hardaway Jr. as a
"superstar."
In trying to find a player with
a similar game, Ford compared
Hardaway Jr. to another tweener
in Chicago Bulls guard/forward
Jimmy Butler, a Marquette prod-
uct who was picked with the last
pick in the first round in June.
Of course, all this analysis is
overshadowed by the larger ques-
tion - will Hardaway Jr. leave
the Wolverines after this season?
It would be the third consecutive
year with an early departure for
Michigan, after Morris surprised
many by leaving school after his
sophomore season and Manny
Harris left the year before.
"He won't need the money,
and a lotof times that's a big issue
for players," Ford said. "He's got
his dad, (so) he's going to have
access to more NBA guys giving
him their opinions, which means
he probably won't get bad info.
I probably say he stays, but I'm
always surprised."
For Michigan, the primary
concern is how Hardaway Jr.
plays this season. After a Maui
Invitational in which the guard
averaged 20 points per game
against top competition, the Wol-
verines hope his play continues at
the rate that so impresses their
opponents.

THE GAME
From Page 1A
Mike Martin stayed.
The team's best defensive play-

defenses finally was a part of a
true Michigan defense.
Martin, Van Bergen and fifth-
year enior cPensivetackle Will

"We just kind of stood out

there and soaked it in - what this
team had done," Martin said.
David Molk stayed.
He anchored the offensive line
Robinson turned to in the fourth
quarter when the Wolverines
needed to ice the game.
"We're going to ride you guys,"
Robinson told them. "You're going
to win this for us."

streak, became the lifeline of
Hoke's offense, protecting Rob-
inson and guiding a powerful run

U5

his career became an after-
thought.
When it was done, the usually
even-keeled Molk laughed the
loudest.
"It's been a long time," Molk
said. "I've been through a lot of
stuff. But then again, in the end,
you truly realize what this place
means.
"I love Michigan, there's no,
doubt about it. I don't care what
we had to go through. I love this
school. I love this university. I
love this team. I love my team-
mates. I love my coaches. This is
great. This is what college foot-
ball is. (I'll) never forget it."
Senior receivers Kevin Koger,
Junior Hemingway and Martavi-
ous Odoms all stayed, and they
all caught touchdown passes
against the Buckeyes.
Those who stayed were
around long enough to see
Hoke's countdown clocks be
reset - on Sunday, one of them
read "zero" days since Michigan
last beat "Ohio," the other read
"364 days" until the next edition
of The Game.
Many seniors watched the
finale unfold from the sidelines,
their reward for staying being a

kiss on the cheek from Hoke and
a personalized Michigan football
from the pregame senior day fes-
tivities.
Still, those who stayed will
forever be known as Brady Hoke's
first team - Team 132, as he calls
them - immortalized just like Bo
Schembechler's first team in 1969.
When Schembechler told that
team, "Those who stay will be
champions," he didn't inherit the
110th-ranked defense. His quar-
terback wasn't an enigma.
We've learned that sometimes
those who stay will have to
endure. They will be ridiculed.
They will be embarrassed, playing
through the worst three years in
the history of Michigan football.
They will represent a dark age,
one unknown to anyone before
their time. They will be consid-
ered the children of a prestigious
program that just don't fit in.
If Team 132 has taught us any-
thing, it's that there won't always
be championships for those who
stay, but there will be glory.
Those who stay will knock off
Notre Dame under the lights at
Michigan Stadium. They'll demol-
ish Nebraska, welcoming Big Red
to the Big Ten the way Michigan

teams of old would. And, above
all, those who stay will beat Ohio
State, completing their journey
from forgettable to legendary.
Those who stay will bring back
Michigan football.
They immediately bought into
a magical coach and didn't look
back. Hoke taught them how to
play "Michigan football," when
they admittedly didn't know the
meaning of the phrase.
He made sure the Ohio State
game would be the most impor-
tant of their lives. Molk said The
Game was emphasized "a thou-
sand times" more than during the
three-year Rich Rodriguez era,
and they'll remember this win -
the one that ended Ohio State's
seven-year win streak - forever.
Those who stay will love Brady
Hoke and all he stands for. They'll
play for him because he loved
them first.
"He is us; we are him," Molk
said. "I love him. I love how he
coaches. I love his leadership
ability and how he does it. I'd do
anything for him.
"If I ever (come) back, 20 years
from now, the first guy I would
find, I would call coach Hoke.
That's who he is."

When the fans rushed the field,
the seniors who stayed thought,
"finally," as Van Bergen did, and
the win over Ohio State brought
them to tears. They drenched
Hoke in water, then hugged him.
One student in the stands
stayed. She held a sign that read:
"Brady, thanks for making our
senior year."
Eventually, Team 132 left the
Michigan fa lily on the field and
gathered in the locker room. An
emotional Hoke told them how
he's "proud of them and what
they've done for Michigan."
"Just to see them happy, that's
the neat part," Hoke said. "I
mean, the investment and com-
mitment they've made as ateam.
It's special. It's special. It's one of
those good days."
Those who stayed huddled
together one last time in the Big
House.
Van Bergen shouted, "Team 132
'til the death."
For having stayed, they gotto
sing "The Victors." And it will
never again sound so sweet.

Michigan halts seven-year skid in The Game

In complete team effort,
Team 132 holds off
Buckeyes in final minutes
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
Fifth-year senior defensive end Ryan Van
Bergen was crying as he emerged from the
crowd gathering by the student section.
Senior defensive tackle Mike Martin stood
in front of the tunnel taking photo after photo
with students he didn't know.
Senior tight end Kevin Koger was sur-
rounded by a group of fans who had rushed
the field along with thousands of their
friends, hugging and patting him, preventing
the Toledo native from making his wayup the
Michigan Stadium tunnel.
This is what beating Ohio State looks like.

How does it feel?
"If I could put it into words, I would,"
said fifth-year senior wide receiver Junior
Hemingway.
After seven longyears of waiting, the Mich-
igan football team finally figured out that
feeling, with a dramatic 40-34 victory over
the Buckeyes at the Big House on Saturday.
The 17th-ranked Wolverines (6-2 Big Ten,
10-2 overall) didn't do it easily or gracefully
- they needed a last-minute overthrow and a
final interception from the defense to seal the
game - but they did it.
"What satisfies you is when you see those
kids in that locker room and when you saw
them on the field, how (happy they are)," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke. "It's fun as a
coach to see how they responded."
Junior quarterback Denard Robinson led
the way for Michigan. In one of the best and
biggest games of his career, he threw for 167
yards and three touchdowns and rushed for

170 yards and two more touchdowns. Robin-
son had just three incompletions. His touch-
down pass to Koger early in the fourth proved
to be the final margin.
But in a 74-point shootout, it came down
to a defensive stop. Two negated Michigan
touchdowns, one on an official review and
another due to penalty, gave Buckeye fresh-
man quarterback Braxton Miller a final
chance after the Wolverines settled for a field
goal and just a six-point lead.
The defense struggled all day against Mill-
er, who had a career day with a combined 335
total yards and three touchdowns. One drive
earlier, Ohio State needed just five plays to go
80 yards and bring the deficit within three,
37-34.
"(We felt) we let our offense down," Van
Bergen said. "We really wanted to be able to
let the offense hand the ball off to us so to
speak and we let them down once. We said
as we came to the bench, 'It's not happening

again. No way.'"
With 45 seconds left on the clock, on 4th-
and-6 from his own territory, Miller tried to
fit a pass in to Buckeye wide receiver Devin
Smith. The ball bounced off Smith and into
the air. Sophomore cornerback Courtney
Avery dove and made the interception, finally
sealingthe game.
At long last, 2,296 winless days against
Ohio State had come to end.
"When the interception came it was kind
of like, 'There it is,' " fifth-year senior center
David Molk said. "That's what we needed to
turn. That's that momentum change that we
needed to completely lock this game down.
The defense stepped up. They did what they
had to do when the time came."
For the final two minutes, it appeared
Michigan was one play away from ending the
seven years of frustration. Redshirt sopho-

Lloyd Carr's seat got hotter with

third-straight embarrassing loss
appeared tobe the final straw in
Rich Rodriguez's termination.
In the dawn of a new era, Hoke
is here to stay, having become the
first coach since Fielding H. Yost
to win 10 games in his first season
as coach in 1901.
Braxton Miller's here to stay,
too. -
The smooth-running, cool
customer slashed Michigan's
defense for 100 rushing yards. He
came advertised as apoor man's
Denard Robinson with aworse
arm, yet the true freshman nearly
made enough plays to knock off
the favored Wolverines.
Had he hit just one of the four
deep passes he overthrew, Ohio
State could've won the game.

DeVier Posey running free with
less than two minutes left should
haunt Ohio State for a while.
"He's got abrightfuture,"
Fickell said of Miller. "But what
you can't teach is that passion and
that desire to be a competitor. In
games like this, you look at, 'Did
he throw the ball well? Or did he
do something else well?' Or do
you just look at somebody and say
they're a competitor?"
Miller will be under the watch-
ful eye of a man who made Tim
Tebow look like more than just
a running quarterback. Meyer's
offensive scheme has worked
wherever he's been, and you can
picture the marquee now: The

Brady and Urban. Urban and

to The Game, just like Bo and
Woody.
Before he exits stage left, at
least Fickell leaves us with this
pearl of wisdom: "That's what
sports are about, you get knocked
down and you get back up."
Before Woody, Ohio State
was known as "the graveyard of
coaches," for ushering out five dif-
ferent head coaches in11 years.
At 6-6, with sanctions looming,
Ohio State is down again. Hoke
should extenda helping hand -
help Meyer stand and then put up
his dukes.
Because knocking down Ohio
State when they're standing tall
and proud - on top of the world
- will go far in proving just how
powerful Michigan really is.

When Denard Robinsonsmiles,
chances are, Michigan fans can't
help but smile, too.
But when Robinson smiles the
way he did after a 40-34 victory
over Ohio State - the Wolverines'
first in seven years against the
Buckeyes - well, that's a smile
that Michigan fans have been
waitingto see for what felt like an
eternity.
"I want to be nowhere else
except with these guys," Robin-
son said after the game.
Then he paused, and flashed
his pearly whites.
"I'm glad I stayed."
After a season in which fans
and critics alike have questioned
Robinson's ability, even going so
far as to say sophomore Devin
Gardner should start at quarter-
back over Robinson, it's safe to
say after Saturday's performance
there are few, if any, Michigan
fans that aren't happy Robinson
stayed, too.
Robinson did it all against the
Buckeyes, rackingup 181yards on
26 carries for two touchdowns,
while completing 14-of-17 pass-
es for 167 yards and three more
scores.
He climbed the rankings in the
record books as well. After his
first touchdown pass of the day
to fifth-year senior wide receiver
Junior Hemingway - Robinson's
36th of his career - he passed for-
mer quarterback Tom Brady on
the all-time passing touchdowns
list. When it was all said and
done, Robinson was sixth in pass-

ing touchdowns and fifth on the
all-time rushing touchdowns list,
passing former quarterback Rich
Leach after his 35th-career score
in the second quarter against the
Buckeyes.
"(Robinson) did great," said
senior center David Molk. "It's
apparent how he's matured
throughout the season. We were
always composed, we were always
ready for another drive.
"There was nothing that was
goingto stop us today."
And there truly was little that
could stop Robinson and the
Michigan offense - especially
when the Wolverines needed to
score to keep momentum in their
favor.
After Ohio State began the
game with a six-play, 80-yard
touchdown drive, there's Wol-
verine fans already began to see
flashbacks of the previous seven
losses. Michigan had to answer -
and it did. On 2nd-and-4 from the
Ohio State 41-yard line, Robinson
faked the handoff to sophomore
running back Fitzgerald Tous-
saint. Robinson then took one jab
step right, cut back left and was
off to the races.
There aren't many football
players in America that will beat
Robinson in a foot race. And there
certainly were no Buckeyes that
could do it. Robinson took off for
the 41-yard touchdown run, eve-
ning the score at 7-7.
"You got a guy that fast - he
makes plays," Molk said. "Same
with Fitz, those two can hit a hole
and they know where to go, and
they know how to read a defense."
On Michigan's next drive, Rob-

Junior Denard Robinson passed Tom Brady for seventh on Michigan's all-time career passing touchdowns list.

inson showed off his arm - the
same arm that critics have said all
year isn't good enough.
On 2nd-and-7 from the Ohio
State 26, Robinson dropped back
to pass. He looked ... and looked
... and looked. He could've made
lunch, tweeted about how good
his lunch was (on his defunct
Twitter account, even), and called
his mother with the amount of
time he had.
Finally, Robinson fired a strike
across the middle, completing
with Hemingway for the 26-yard
score. Earlier in his career, Robin-
son may have panicked with that
much time to throw - or he may
have just taken off and ran. But
on Saturday, he proved how much
he's matured as a quarterback.
"He's calm, patient with the

ball," Hemingway said. "He didn't
force anything. If it wasn't open,
he ran it. If it was open, he threw
it."
Robinson showed off his arm
again in the third quarter, firinga
bullet across the middle to senior
receiver Martavious Odoms for
the 20-yard score on a critical
third down.
But it was Robinson's easiest
pass of the day that was arguably
the most important. With Michi-
gan up by just three and in seri-
ous need of some breathing room
early in the fourth quarter, Robin-
son found senior tight end Kevin
Koger wide open in the endzone
off a play-action fake for a four-
yard touchdown pass - Robin-
son's third of the game.
"It was a great play call," Koger

said. "I was fortunate enough to
slip inside the defensive end, and
ran into the corner and Denard
found me."
The play gave Michigan a 37-27
lead with 8:32 to play and proved
to be the game winner.
But Robinsonnever onetotake
credit for himself, credited the
offensive line for his success both
in the air and on the ground.
When asked why Michigan
was so successful in the rushing
game, Robinson didn't have to say
anything. All he did was point to
the big man sitting next to him -
Molk.
"The big guys up front, they
open holes," he said.
Then he smiled.
And after Saturday, Michigan
fans are smiling, too.

As a kid,senior tight end Kevin
Koger never missed The Game.
On that crisp weekend every
November, he would join his
father and N
brother in the NOTEBOOK
living room in
Toledo, Ohio to watch the Michi-
gan and Ohio State football teams
do battle.
But he was never a Buckeye
fan. Koger's father was raised in
Detroit, and his passion for Mich-
igan rubbed off on his sons.
When Kogerwas beingrecruit-
ed as a four-startight end, he held
scholarship offers from four Big
Ten schools, but it was always
between Michigan and Ohio
State. The Wolverines won out.
Thenthe Buckeyes beathimthree
straight seasons.
"I never second guessed my
decision," Koger said last Monday.
Even when Ohio State was
going to national title games?
"Never."
When he lined up alongside
redshirt sophomore offensive
tackle Taylor Lewan at the four-
yard line midway through the
fourth quarter on Saturday in
Michigan's 40-34 victory, Koger
had his chance at redemption.
He didn't miss it.
On 3rd-and-1, Koger ran five
steps forward, angled to the cor-
ner of the endzone and turned
back toward the line of scrim-
mage. Junior quarterback Denard
Robinson was coming out of a
play-action fake and spied Koger
running free in the flat.
Robinson lofted a pass over two
defenders and into Koger's hands

to give Michigan a 37-27 lead. The
touchdown turned out to be the
game winner.
Surrounded by 114,132 hys-
terical fans at Michigan Stadium,
Koger was right at home.
"I've always said my dream
has always been to catch a touch-
down in the Michigan-Ohio State
game," Koger said, beaming in
the postgame press conference. "I
finally did that, so it means a lot to
me and my family."
This time, his family wasn't sit-
ting in the living room in Toledo,
they were there to see it live atthe
Big House.
Koger finished as Robinson's
favoritetarget, rackingup a game-
high four catches.
After being named a captain
in August, Koger grew into the
spotlight and earned a more
prominent role in the offense.
Teammates tabbed him with the
nickname "Hypeman 86" early
in the season to match his ener-
getic personality, and that charm
hasn't left the senior.
For his entire senior season,
Koger and Michigan said, "Beat
Ohio" after every team meeting.
Countdown clocks were installed
in Schembechler Hall. Koger
couldn't forget about Ohio State if
he wanted to.
And finally, for the first and
last time in his career, Hypeman
86 faced the Buckeyes and walked
away a victor.
1K CLUB: One thousand yards.
It's a number that won't put
either Robinson or redshirt soph-
omore Fitzgerald Toussaint into
Heisman contention this season,
but it's a big reason the Wolver-
ines are sitting at 10-2 and on the
brink of a BCS-bowl berth.

The antics certainly drew a few
laughs around the stadium, but it
wasn't a first-time stunt.

tain David Molk said. "We have a
little short practice, and atthe end

Molk threw his hands apart to
mimic an explosion.
"Like a bomb blowing up and

Not everyone was so pleased
with the celebration, though.
"I lost so much respect for
Michigan after they won (and)

fullback Zach Boren wrote on
Twitter. "This is a great rivalry

LOOKING GOOD

FEELING BLUE

THE MICHIGAN SENIORS: It has
been a long road for the seniors
of "Team 132." They endured
everything, from the 3-9 season
to Rich Rod's "You Raise Me
Up" meltdown at the Michigan
Football Bust in his final year.
Saturday, they did what no other
senior class in the past seven
years could do. They beat Ohio
State. Offensive linemen David
Molk and Mark Huyge blocked
well enough to push both junior
quarterback Denard Robinson
and redshirt sophomore running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint over
the 1,000-yard mark. Defensive
linemen Ryan Van Bergen and
Mike Martin combined for 13
tackles, including two for loss.
Tight end Kevin Koger caught the
touchdown pass that turned out
to be the winning score. Wide
receiver Junior Hemingway and
Martavious Odoms also had TDs.
But that won't be what they will be
remembered for. They were Brady
Hoke's first class and they were the
ones that broke the losing streak.

OHIO STATE FULLBACK ZACH
BOREN: Michigan had some
candidates who could be "Feeling
Blue." Sophomore punter Will
Hagerup dropped a punt. Redshirt
junior guard Patrick Omameh had
the holding penalty that negated
Robinson's final touchdown and
fifth-year senior tight end Steve
Watson had the personal foul
penalty on the same play. Both'~
led to the nailbiting finish. But
Michigan won. The streak is over.
No one on Michigan is "Feeling
Blue" right now. The honor goes
to Ohio State fullback Zach
Boren, who wasn't particularly
happy with Michigan's grenade
celebration after the game. "I lost
so much respect for Michigan
after they won (and) threw the
ball in the air acting like it was
a grenade," he tweeted. "This is
a great rivalry and to take it to
that level of disrespect is just so
uncalled for. Act like you have won
before (and) treat this rivalry like
it should be treated." You could
have just beaten them, Zach.
