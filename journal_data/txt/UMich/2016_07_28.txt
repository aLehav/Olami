Young people rock DNC with 
protests, but students sit back 

GRANT HARDY/Daily

A young boy protests the DNC in support of Bernie Sanders with his father outside the Wells Fargo Center, Philadelphia, PA.

Millenials fall 
behind Clinton

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

PHILADELPHIA 
— 
Amid 

leaked DNC emails and fears 
of a divided party, Sen. Bernie 
Sanders’ 
supporters 
ignited 

protests throughout Philadelphia 
during the Democratic National 
Convention this week. Additionally, 
many delegates at the convention 
came in protest with taped mouths 
and rampant booing of various 
speakers who praised presumptive 
Democratic 
nominee 
Hillary 

Clinton.

Protesters came from varying 

demographics, but the majority 
tended to be millennials — a core 
group of support for Sanders 
throughout the primary season. 

However, few of these young people 
were current students. Out of 25 
young people to whom the Daily 
spoke with at various protests, just 
five were current students. Three 
of those five students stated they 
intended on supporting Clinton in 
the general election, despite their 
reluctance. 

Catherine McGurk, a student at 

Arcadia University, said she plans 
to vote for Clinton because the 
movement Sanders started must 
begin on a smaller scale.

“I believe that grassroots works 

from the ground up,” she said. “So 
local elections are more important 
if you are trying to get a grassroots 
candidate elected, someone who is 
an independent, for example. But at 
the presidential level I believe it is 
still Republican or Democrat, and 
Hillary is more aligned with my 
beliefs, so I’m going to pick her.”

The students also agreed that 

the majority of students on their 
campuses plan to support Clinton 
despite their initial commitment to 
Sanders.

Angel Green, a member of the 

Up to Us movement which supports 
Sanders’ campaign and grassroots 
change in government, confirmed 
that while her group is — at its core 
— made up of young people, just a 
few members are current students.

Many of these students and 

young 
people 
are 
protesting 

because they fear the consequences 
of a Hillary Clinton and Donald 
Trump presidency, equally. On 
campus, 
according 
to 
College 

Democrats chair Collin Kelly, a 
rising LSA junior, the mentality is a 
little different.

“I know that people aren’t 

as 
enthusiastic 
about 
Hillary 

Clinton as there were about Bernie 
Sanders,” Kelly said. “But even the 
most skeptical person of (Hillary 

Clinton) is more scared of what 
would happen if Trump were 
elected.”

Nonetheless, 
the 
recent 

Wikileaks 
release 
of 
e-mails 

showing the DNC was clearly biased 
against Sanders may cause more 
students to join the “Never Hillary” 
or “Still Sanders” movements.

Students for Sanders president 

Nick Kolenda, an LSA rising junior, 
wrote in an e-mail interview with 
The Daily that, though he views the 
movements as slightly dangerous, 
he understands the frustration 
among Sanders supporters.

“Personally (as a “Never say 

never” kind of person) I think that 
it’s risky if you’re a progressive 
supporting 
that 
particular 

movement as we live under a 
majoritarian system,” he wrote. 
“However, after the revelations 
from Wikileaks, the anger is

Pokemon Go captures A2 

and University community

City Council 
in Ward 3 bid 
 

CAMPUS LIFE
ANN ARBOR

Game benefits 

players and 

businesses but has 

safety concerns 

By 
IRENE 
PARK 
and 

MADELEINE GERSON

Summer Daily News Editor and Daily 

Staff Reporter

University of Michigan students 

and Ann Arbor residents, like the 
rest of the world, are working hard 
to catch ’em all.

Pokemon 
Go, 
a 
game 

app 
developed 
by 
software 

development company Niantic, 
has captivated millions of players. 
The game has already broken 
several records, including the 
number of downloads on the Apple 
App Store during the first week of 
release — 7.2 million downloads, 

towering 2.2 million 

downloads 
for 

Angry 
Birds 
2. 

The 
game 
has 

been downloaded 

more than 40 million times on 
the App Store and Google Play, 
bringing in more than $45 million 
in net revenue.

During the game, players walk 

around the real world to catch 
Pokemon — the game uses a 
smartphone camera to detect the 
Pokemon and the phone screen 
to prompt the player to throw a 
Pokeball to catch it. In addition, 
players can walk to designated 
locations called “PokeStops” to 
collect items like Pokeballs, which 
are required to catch Pokemon.

Recent LSA alum Roxanne 

Ilagan said that she was first 
attracted to the game because she 
has been a fan of the franchise, but 
she grew to like the game because 
it encourages her to be more 
physically active.

“I was a huge Pokemon fan 

growing 
up, 
so 
I 
naturally 

downloaded 
the 
app,” 
Ilagan 

said. “I really love the concept 
of walking to new places for 
Pokestops and Pokemon. The 
other day, I walked all the way to 
Gallup Park from Central Campus 
… I walked 30 more miles last week 

than what I usually do.”

Ilagan is one of the moderators 

for a Facebook group called 
Pokemon Go: Ann Arbor — a 
group for Pokemon Go players 
in Ann Arbor to share tips with 
other players about where to find a 
certain Pokemon, organize group-
playing events and establish a 
“sense of community” among the 
players. As of Wednesday, the 
group had 463 members.

Not all students are Pokemon 

Go fans, however. LSA sophomore 
Davon Smith said there are too 
many risks associated with the 
game, so she did not download the 
app.

“Playing Pokemon Go, you are 

wandering into unknown places; 
given that people know where 
PokeStops are when they find 
them themselves, anyone can have 
access to your location and you can 
become a target,” Smith said.

While Smith said the social 

aspect of the game exposes players 
to potential threats, Ilagan said 
it actually encouraged her to 
play. According to a Wall Street 
Journalarticle, the game requires 

that players show up in person at 
PokeStops, so it catalyzes social 
interaction among players.

“Without 
the 
game, 
I 

wouldn’t have had any reason 
to talk to (the other players) 
… I think it has definitely 
influenced my decision to play 
since I do think it’s significantly 
more fun to meet people or walk 
to new places with friends,” 
Ilagan said.

While 
Pokemon 
Go 
has 

garnered 
attention 
for 
its 

social and health benefits, the 
therapeutic uses of the game 
may not be as well known. The 
University 
Health 
System’s 

C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital 
is utilizing the game as a 
part of a therapy that enables 
children with serious illnesses 
to cope with treatment. USA 
Today featured a video of 
patients at Mott, many of whom 
have not left their beds for 
weeks, laughing while playing 
Pokemon 
Go 
with 
nurses, 

doctors and other children.

Incumbent Warpehoski 

hopes to maintain 
pragmatic leadership

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily News Editor

Kevin Leeser, a nurse at the 

University of Michigan Health 
System, hopes his bid to unseat 
incumbent City Councilmember 
Chuck Warpehoski (D–Ward 3) 
can shift the state of affairs in city 
government to be more receptive 
to the needs of constituents.

As a new father, Leeser says 

he saw the traffic layout around 
his neighborhood to be a hazard 
to his children, as did many of 
his neighbors. However, when he 
pushed to lower the speed limit of 
his residential streets to 25 mph 
several years ago — among other 
improvements to pedestrian safety 
— Leeser said city government 
was too slow to address the issue.

“Being a nurse, I see the actual 

ramifications of these accidents 
that were happening,” Leeser said, 
noting there were three deaths 
in Ann Arbor from pedestrian 
accidents in 2015. “If (the public) 
could see how serious some of 
these accidents are … it’s head 
injuries, lifelong injuries. To me, 
it’s a public health issue.”

Leeser says this is a broader 

reflection of citizen disengagement 
from City Council, which drove 
him 
to 
unsuccessfully 
mount 

a 
write-in 
challenge 
against 

Warpehoski’s Ward 3 colleague 
Chip Smith (D) in 2015.

“You can sit there and go to 

City Council meetings and pour 
your heart out, and City Council 
can just go, ‘yup, thank you,’ and 
then vote against you,” Leeser 
said, referring specifically to how 
the council brushed aside vocal 
opposition to the Ann Arbor 
deer cull from residents, though 
city surveys have indicated the 
majority of the city continues to 
support lethal culls.

Doctors say surgery 
is case-based and not 

for everyone

By MEHRUNISA KHAN

Daily Staff Reporter

When it comes to a patient’s 

decision on how to treat a health 
threat, knowledge is key to 
navigate through a myriad of 
treatment options.

Each year, more than 230,000 

women are diagnosed with breast 
cancer, and more than 40,000 
will die from the disease. It is 
considered a common medical 
condition in women; one in eight 
women will be diagnosed with 
breast cancer sometime in their 
life.

Steven Katz, University of 

Michigan professor of internal 
medicine, explained that the 
treatment 
process 
can 
be 

stressful, since there are different 
options for patients, including 
surgery, radiation, chemotherapy 
and 
pills. 
Information 
for 

treatment recommendations has 
become increasingly complicated, 
as it now includes stages of cancer, 
its spread and the biological 
characteristics of the cancer.

“All women have the decision 

about surgery, and it’s not that 
easy to do because they have to 
consider the choices they have 
for surgery and all of the other 
treatments that go into the 
management of breast cancer,” 
Katz said.

One possible breast cancer 

treatment is bilateral, or double, 
mastectomy, 
which 
removes 

both breasts to prevent cancer. 
The number of women who 

underwent double mastectomies 
performed has tripled in the past 
10 years. In 1998, 3.6 percentof 
women younger than 40 had 
the procedure, but, in 2011, the 
percentage jumped to 33 percent. 
In spite of this increase, double 
mastectomies do not necessarily 
improve chances of survival, Katz 
said.

Michael Sabel, University chief 

of surgical oncology, wrote in 
an e-mail to the Daily that some 
double 
mastectomies 
can 
be 

warranted. Genetic testing looks 
for changesin a patient’s genes, 
proteins or chromosomes. For 
breast cancer, mutations in genes 
called BRCA1 and BRCA2 put 
patients at a higher risk for breast 
cancer. Younger women who have 
the cancer or are at a higher risk 
for developing breast cancer in 
the future may choose to undergo 
double mastectomies to prevent a 
second or first incident of breast 
cancer, respectively.

“In 
2002, 
genetic 
testing 

became available for decision 
making prior to surgery and 
so younger women with breast 
cancer, or women with very strong 
family histories, could undergo 
genetic testing, and, if they 
harbored a genetic mutation, they 
stood a high chance of developing 
a (second) cancer and thus opted 
for bilateral mastectomy to not 
only treat the known cancer but 
also prevent a second cancer in the 
future,” Sabel wrote. “However, 
genetic testing is (im)perfect — 
there are young women or women 
with very strong family histories 
who test negative for a genetic 
mutation, and we don’t know 
every gene responsible for breast 
cancer, so many women who are 
considered high-risk may also opt 

for bilateral mastectomies.”

Sabel said, in addition to genetic 

testing, other factors — such as 
imaging from MRIs or improved 
reconstruction surgery — could 
be involved in the decision to 
have a double mastectomy. 

However, Sabel wrote there 

is still misinformation on the 
benefits of a double mastectomy 
that can mislead women in their 
decisions. 
Sabel 
cited 
media 

coveragesof 
celebrities 
who 

have had double mastectomies, 
and other social media outlets 
as possible sources that spread 
misinformation.

“While doing the more drastic 

surgery may reduce risk of a 
(second) cancer, for most breast 
cancer patients that risk is not 
that high and it is important to 
note that bilateral mastectomy 
does not improve survival over 
other options, such as breast 
conservation,” 
Sabel 
wrote. 

“These ideas likely come from 
multiple 
sources. 
 
We 
just 

wrote an article studying the 
possible impact of celebrity news 
reporting on perpetuating this. 
There are more blogs, support 
groups, 
websites, 
etc. 
about 

breast cancer that may propagate 
this. There is also likely word of 
mouth from family or friends who 
have gone through breast cancer 
treatment.”

Katz 
explained 
that 
the 

pressure of the situation tends 
to make patients react quickly 
— going with their guts and 
the recommendations of their 
doctors. 
Sometimes 
these 

decisions are made after one visit.

“In 
that 
context, 
people, 

men or women can prefer or 
favor an extensive treatment 

‘U’ experts weigh pros and 
cons of double mastectomy

Incumbent defends 

seat against two 

challengers

By ISHI MORI

Daily Staff Reporter

City 
Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1) faces 
two different challengers — Jason 
Frenzel and Will Leaf — in next 
week’s Democratic primary for 
City Council elections. 

Incumbent Kailasapathy is a 

fiscally conservative pragmatist 
who has held her City Council 
seat since 2012. A child of Sri 
Lankan academics, Kailasapathy 
came to the United States to 
attend college and is currently 
an accountant at Edwards, Ellis, 
Armstrong & Company, P.C., 
an accounting firm based in 
downtown Ann Arbor.

As a candidate with a financial 

background, Kailasapathy said 
there are low-hanging fruits 
when it comes to increasing 
revenue and cutting costs in 
city government. She named 
revisiting the tax capture policies 
of the Downtown Development 
Authority 
and 
the 
Local 

Development Funding Authority 
to make their revenue cap $4 
million instead of the current $6 
million as one way to increase 
revenue.

In a July 12 televised candidate 

forum, she pointed out that 
revenue 
for 
these 
entities 

increased by 50 percent over 
the last four years, advocating 
and redirecting that income to 
city funds. She says there are 
challenges, however.

“I think a lot of council 

members feel indebted to the 
DDA members because a lot of 
them support the candidates 
who are running for City Council 
and they really don’t want to 
step on their toes,” Kailasapathy 
said in an interview with the 
Daily. “Anything to do with the 
DDA, council members are very 
hesitant to take action even 
though there was all this extra 
money this year that was beyond 

projection.”

This commitment to fighting 

existing 
structures 
was 

showcased 
in 
the 
televised 

forum when the candidates were 
discussing the portions of emails 
regarding the construction of a 
planned Amtrak station redacted 
by city staff members in June.

City 
Council 
candidate 

Jason Frenzel said that, though 
he 
supported 
maximum 

transparency, he felt there was 
a justified reason for city staff in 
withholding information.

“I 
think 
in 
(the 
e-mail) 

conversation we need to realize 
what’s the situation,” Frenzel said. 
“We don’t as a public understand 
what that conversation is and 
what it was, why it was redacted. 
In my honest opinion, I know our 
staff to be strong, professional 
leaders in their industry … and I 
think challenging our staff in a 
public forum isn’t necessarily a 
valid way for an organization to 
behave.”

Kailasapathy quickly pounced 

on Frenzel’s ambiguity, stating 
that she supports a Freedom 
of 
Information 
Act 
request 

concerning the redacted portions, 
especially because the documents 
in question do not reveal the 
location 
of 
highly 
classified 

government nuclear plants.

“This is not national security 

issues we’re talking about, spies 
or spying on other countries,” 
Kailasapathy said in an interview 
with the Daily. “This is about that 
train station, and if you want the 
train station to serve best for our 
people’s needs, at every stage it 
should be transparent.”

Kailasapathy also suggested 

Frenzel 
cannot 
make 
the 

necessary 
reforms 
for 

transparency 
because 
of 
his 

financial and family ties.

“DDA 
reforms, 
having 

oversight, term limits … I doubt 
Jason Frenzel will be able to do 
that because I think his backing 
comes from the DDA and his 
stepmother (Sandi Smith) was the 
head of the DDA.”

Council’s first Ward

S

cience is a human invention, 
based on the unique ability 
to employ rational thought 

toward 
observation. 
The 
Greek 

philosopher 
Aristotle 
championed empirical observation 
as the best way to draw universal 
conclusions about the world. The 
sun rises from the east. Living things 
need food to survive. These are 
truths which all developed minds 
agree upon. However, while a human 
invention, rational thinking guides 
only a portion of human thought. 
Humans have other influences too 
— less cerebral and more deeply 
ingrained.

Many Americans, especially, often 

seem portrayed as rejecting rational 
thought. Watching and reading the 
news lately, especially about the 
Republican National Convention, I 
am reminded of how many people 
apparently let go of reason and fact 
for the sake of their beliefs or out 
of a strong emotion such as fear or 
determination.

This is an age where social 

media and other outlets enable 
anyone to voice their arguments 
to the widest audience possible, 
without the necessity for fact-
checking. Donald Trump has, over 
the course of a year, captured the 
support of people who have ignored 
factual arguments or have been 
unable to justify their convictions 
for carefully-considered, specific 
reasons. 
Instead, 
they 
feel 

uncertain of the direction they 
see in their lives within a more-
globalized, 
unfamiliar 
world. 

Trump 
hasn’t 
delivered 
many 

specific step-by-step plans for 
how his administration will carry 
out their policies in order to draw 
votes, but he also hasn’t needed to.

Equally amazing, if not more 

so, has been widespread refusal 

in the United States to accept 
human responsibility for climate 
change through the increase of 
atmospheric carbon dioxide to 
unprecedented levels and rising 
temperatures. Proponents for more 
sustainable 
practices 
hammer 

away that 97 percent of climate 
scientists 
agree 
about 
human 

activities 
accelerating 
climate 

warming. The scientific method 
confirms this again and again, yet 
it didn’t prevent a U.S. senator from 
bringing a snowball onto the Senate 
floor during winter in Washington 
as evidence for the unlikelihood of 
climate change’s existence. As of 
two years ago, half of all Americans 
didn’t ascribe to this belief either. 
Their opinions are rationalized by 
something other than science.

Today, the scientific method 

and rational thinking still hold 
tremendous sway in our society. 
The 
professions 
of 
medicine, 

engineering and science are among 
the most prestigious to be achieved. 
Humans have been able to utilize 
the rational mind to succeed in some 
of the greatest feats in history: the 
construction of towering structures, 
sending people to the moon or to live 
for months in space, and building 
the Internet to enable instantaneous 
mixed-media 
communication 

between continents.

This is not a critique of those 

who make decisions on divisive 
issues informed by something other 
than science and rational thinking, 
but a consideration of why such 
people arrive at the opinions they 
have. Every individual has the 
mental capacity to think rationally, 
but no individual chooses to in all 
situations. Even the most utilitarian 
of individuals, to some degree, may 
cave to their less rational desires. 

It’s easy for a supporter of a 

cause, like transitioning to cleaner 
energy, to portray their opponents 
as unintelligent and uninformed. 

But those who may not require 
the latest science to inform their 
opinion often have a deeper-rooted 
rationalization. For example, some 
opponents of clean energy who favor 
the use of fossil fuels have relied 
on those forms of energy for their 
livelihood.

I remember visiting the tiny, 

struggling 
Appalachian 
town 

of Dante, Virginia (pronounced 
“Daint”), whose economy has relied 
on coal mining for 100 years. Its 
inhabitants lamented the industry’s 
transition to other fuel sources. 
The movement to transition toward 
cleaner energy has seen coal as part 
of the problem, but investing in the 
technology to eliminate emissions 
due to coal burning may make as 
large an impact in the short term as 
beginning to switch the power grid 
to renewable sources.

The 
decision 
by 
so 
many 

Americans to subscribe to feelings 
over 
facts 
concerning 
critical 

national issues is worrisome. Yet, to 
additionally barrage someone with 
science-backed data in attempt to 
dismantle their arguments proves 
ineffective toward reaching common 
ground. What then can be done to 
create harmony between viewpoints 
when those viewpoints are informed 
by such different reasoning?

The solution requires patience 

and dialogue. Those of us who 
rely 
on 
the 
scientific 
method 

and rational thought to inform 
our understanding of the world 
should seek to understand the 
rationalizations 
others 
make 

to 
support 
their 
convictions. 

Sometimes their rationalizations are 
very personal. When the rest of the 
world believes that Americans value 
science less than other developed 
countries, what they are actually 
seeing is diversity.

PHILADELPHIA - As the last days 
of the Bernie Sanders campaign 
come to a close, the Vermont 
senator has a lot 
to do to unify 
the Democratic 
Party. All week, 
protesters have 
marched through the streets of 
Philadelphia, shutting down major 
intersections and hosting massive 
rallies. 
Among 
delegates 
and 

protesters alike, rumors swirled 
about a potential protest of the roll 
call vote, the vote that awarded the 
nomination to the nominee.

In his highly-regarded speech 

Monday night, Sanders said that he 
“looked forward to (the delegates) 
votes on Tuesday night.” This 
symbolic gesture was possibly the 
last chance that Sanders supporters 
had to stop Clinton from securing 
the nomination, and their votes 
would be the symbolic gesture 
that they were opposed to the 
nomination of Clinton.

One protester I spoke to, who 

wished to not be named, indicated 
that he felt it was possible for 
Sanders to still win the nomination. 
As we headed into the Tuesday roll 
call vote, rumors swirled about a 
potential uprising by the Bernie 
Sanders delegates from across the 
country.

Tuesday, per the rules of the 

convention, a roll call vote was 
taken, and in an act of unity, Sanders 
asked for a rule change after every 
state stated their votes and allowed 
Clinton to be nominated without 
contest. Bernie Sanders had fallen 
in line, and it was over.

Shortly 
after, 
hundreds 
of 

Bernie delegates walked out of the 
convention hall and occupied the 
media tent in an act of resistance to 
the nomination of Hillary Clinton 
as the party’s nomination. This 
means, more than anything else, 
that Bernie Sanders has separated 
from his movement. All throughout 
the convention, I heard angry 
statements about people leaving 
the party, but by walking out, the 
delegates had sealed their fates. 
The ultra-progressive wing of the 
Democratic Party is no longer a part 
of the party, and their insurgency 
should be treated as such.

Keep in mind, these weren’t 

the sweaty and screaming radical 
Green Party and socialist movement 
members that were outside the 
gates. No, these protestors were 
elected and certified delegates 
of 
the 
Democratic 
National 

Convention.

It’s reached a point that Michigan 

Democratic Party member Lena 
Thompson said that “It’s up to 
(Clinton) to win us over” and that 
without that, there would be no 
support from Sanders supporters.

Many Sanders supporters are 

falling in line, and many are 
also facing the realization that 
Hillary Clinton is the only other 
alternative to a Donald Trump 
presidency. However, many more 
are dragging their heels to a 
notion of an illegitimate election. 
Several delegates handed me a 
report that insinuated that vote 
totals could be off by “sometimes 
more than 10 percent,” telling me 
that this was due to paper ballots 
being miscounted by corrupt party 
officials.

There are legitimate concerns to 

be had about the bias of the DNC, 
especially in light of the recent 
e-mail hack, in which e-mails were 
leaked from the DNC that mocked 
and talked down the Sanders 
Campaign. However, there is no 
version of reality in which an 
elaborate scheme involving ballot 
counters took down the entire 
Sanders campaign.

During the nominating process, 

many regards and congratulations 
were issued to Bernie Sanders. 
These are all great steps to ensuring 
that Donald Trump does not win in 
November, but buying into the belief 
that “Clinton stole the primary, so 
she can steal the general as well”, as 
Michigan delegate Alan Benchich 
believes, won’t solve anything.

The primary is officially over, and 

so is the candidacy of Bernie Sanders. 
The platform of the Democratic 
Party is the most progressive it has 
ever been, and Sanders has changed 
politics forever. Now, it’s time to 
elect Hillary Clinton and save the 
country from the fate it faces under 
Donald Trump.

Overlooking facts 

DAVID
MERTZ

KEVIN
SWEITZER


One Trump adviser called for 

Clinton to be killed by a “firing 
squad,” C-list speakers angrily 
screamed at the American people 
that we are all in grave danger 
and chants of “Lock her up,” 
reminiscent 
of 
authoritarian 

regimes 
imprisoning 
political 

enemies, rang through the halls. 
The vitriolic atmosphere of the 
last week sought to target our fears 
and inner demons. The Republican 
National Convention showed what 
four years of Trump would be: 
division and hatred.

We are not a “divided crime 

scene,” as Trump said, and our 
country is not on the verge of 
destruction. 
Trump 
attempted 

to frame his convention in terms 
reminiscent of Nixon in 1968 — 
that the world is in utter chaos, 
and he will restore “law and order.” 
However, Trump has failed in two 
ways. First, while violence floods 
our newsfeeds and terrorism seems 
to strike every week, this is not 
1968. For context, our country is 
not in a troubling overseas war with 
500,000 American soldiers on the 
ground like Vietnam, our crime rate 
is dramatically down and our racial 
discord at home does not compare 
to the riots, assassinations and 
violence of 1968. The fervor for a 

law and order candidate is not what 
it was. Furthermore, Nixon allowed 
for hope and a new future in his 
dark talk — Trump has dived into 
the darkness without providing a 
vision for a brighter future.

There’s another way though; 

we do not have to be filled with 
so much fear and hate. Robert F. 
Kennedy embodied this desire for 
togetherness in dark times. On the 
day of Martin Luther King Jr.’s 
assassination in 1968, RFK stood 
on the top of a truck bed and broke 
the news to an African-American 
community in Indianapolis. While 
the news created protests and 
violence across the country, the one 
place that remained peaceful was 
Indianapolis — largely in part to 
RFK’s plea.

He said:
“What we need in the United 

States is not division; what we need 
in the United States is not hatred; 
what we need in the United States 
is not violence or lawlessness, but is 
love and wisdom and compassion 
toward one another, and a feeling of 
justice toward those who still suffer 
within our country, whether they be 
white or whether they be Black.”

This is what we need in our 

country. 
The 
president 
is 
our 

ambassador to the world, and he or 

she can frame the hearts and minds 
of our country. Our kids are watching 
and the future of our country is 
taking their cues from our current 
leaders. Trump spews hatred and 
division because this is his strategy to 
win; we do not need more of that. We 
need a leader who won’t tell people 
to fear and divide, but beg people to 
come together.

Michelle 
Obama’s 
convention 

speech exemplified what we need. 
Not divisiveness but, “when crisis 
hits, we don’t turn against each other 
— no, we listen to each other. We 
lean on each other. Because we are 
always stronger together.” Clinton 
is not RFK, and there are numerous, 
reasonable issues with her potential 
presidency — but she’s what we’ve 
got. Trump’s divisive rhetoric alone 
will tug at the pluralism that defines 
the United States, and the hate 
and anger he brings will clout and 
hurt our country in innumerable 
ways, starting with our political 
environment and trickling down to 
how our children act. Take a step 
back and look at the big picture: Our 
founding principles of acceptance 
and understanding cannot stand 
for a candidate who rolls down the 
slippery slope of sanctioned hate.

The danger of the RNC’s tone

AARON SANDEL

Civics and 
Pokemon Go

T

his is not another think 
piece about Pokemon Go. 
But it’s kind of crazy how 

Pokemon 
Go 

took over the 
mobile 
(and 

augmented 
reality) 
world over the past few weeks. 
Perhaps this is the political 
science minor in me, but the 
first thing I thought about as I 
played the game (besides what 
a lure module does) was how I 
was visiting, for the very first 
time, community centers, public 
buildings, city halls, courthouses 
and libraries in my community 
and the surrounding areas — 
many of which I never knew 
existed.

By this point in 2016, there’s 

quite a lot of political fatigue. 
The Republican nominee is a 
certified racist, misogynist and 
xenophobe with a frighteningly 
cultish fan-base, whose outright 
lack of public policy experience 
and 
violently 
unbridled 

temperament somehow propels 
him forward at every turn. The 
Democratic nominee should be 
one of historic allure, a symbol 
for gender parity and expert 
policy negotiations, but who 
is quelled piecemeal by her 
very own history, a potpourri 
of 
errant 
decisions 
and, 
of 

course, the enduring twilight of 
sexism. And this is all without 
mentioning the nearly weekly 
travesties 
that 
continue 
to 

devastate 
communities 
from 

Nice to Baton Rouge to Orlando 
to Dallas. The political climate 
is, for many, exhausting.

And yet, here we are. We are 

running 
around 
unabashedly. 

Outdoors. Frequenting public 
spaces where local politics — 
perhaps the most practically 
impactful form of government 
— is practiced. Pokemon Go 
has brought us away from the 
lugubrious 
state 
of 
national 

politics and instead directed us, 
by way of Eevees and Bulbasaurs, 
to the steady centers of our 
cities. There lies an immense 
opportunity 
here 
for 
public 

engagement at a scale we have 
not yet experienced.

Ideally, the political system 

should be, in Lincoln’s seminal 
words, “of the people, by the 

people, and for the people.” But 
when more than 80 percent of 
eligible voters fail to participate 
in local elections, the system 
breaks. We can see how broken 
it is every day on the news at a 
federal level. We can see how 
broken it is every day when state 
budget mismanagement leads to 
a horrific endemic. We can see 
how broken it is every day when 
living, breathing children come 
second to greed, corruption and 
making up the bottom line. And 
yet, still voters do not exercise 
their 
hard-fought 
right 
of 

participation.

What if games like Pokemon Go 

could change this? Millennials 
longing for nostalgic fun are 
being exposed to public places of 
organizing and change — what 
if there were augmented reality 
rewards (whether in Poke-form 
or through another innovation) 
for actually taking the next step 
and shaping that change. What if 
voter education and information 
was not done just by dreaded 
phone banking and door-to-door 
canvassing but was something 
people were incentivized to do? 
What if you saw a Vulpix near 
your polling place, and then 
were motivated to register to 
vote? What if, during your quest 
for a set of Pokeballs, you were 
greeted 
by 
some 
milestones 

about how to participate in city 
council meetings? How much 
more engagement could we get?

I don’t think Pokemon is the 

necessarily avenue we should 
take to pursue civic engagement. 
It’s fun, it’s a game and it needs 
to remain fun to retain its user 
base and value — that’s just 
how capitalism works. Pokemon 
Go is just an initial dose of 
augmented reality in the mobile 
tech world. Games like this have 
massive potential to catalyze our 
catatonic (and frankly, shameful) 
public participation rates. And 
maybe once that happens, we 
won’t see such a broken system 
each and every day. Maybe then, 
finally, we can have a body of 
organizers, 
participants 
and 

voters who ascend the ranks of 
politics for a politics of, for and 
by the real people.

‘Star Trek’ not 
‘Beyond’ fluff

By ALEX INTNER

Summer Managing Arts Editor

“Star Trek Beyond” had some-

thing to prove this summer. In a 
year when the big box office sto-
ries focus on 
how 
sequels 

are both criti-
cal and finan-
cial flops, “Star 
Trek” had to 
show it wasn’t 
another 
pure 

cash grab and 
had a reason 
for 
existing. 

While it’s not 
the best new movie this summer, 
the new “Star Trek” film is a damn 
good time and clearly had effort 
put into it. Does it have the depth 
of other summer blockbusters like 
“Captain America Civil War” or 
“Finding Dory”? No, not really. 
But, ultimately that doesn’t mat-
ter here.

“Star Trek Beyond” starts with 

the Enterprise and its crew being 
sent to rescue a stranded crew, 
but they’re then attacked by Krall 
(Idris Elba, “Luther”), who wants 
to steal an artifact that’s onboard. 
He and his crew proceed to 
destroy the ship during the attack. 
The crew then ends up scattered 
across the planet, meeting new 
friends in their attempts to get off 
the planet and stopping Krall from 
destroying a major Star Fleet base.

The film’s biggest redeeming 

quality is how purely watchable 
it was. Simon Pegg (“Shaun of the 
Dead”, who co-wrote the screen-
play with Doug Jung and played 
the character Scotty) brought 
his sensibility to the script, pep-
pering many of the characters’ 
interactions with witty jokes. At 
its best, the banter sang off the 

screen, causing raucous laughter. 
The talented cast embraced these 
moments, especially Pegg, Karl 
Urban’s (“Almost Human”) Bones 
and Zachary Quinto’s (“The Slap”) 
Spock. These moments allowed 
the movie to relax, creating a fast 
and loose feeling that carries it 
from beginning to end.

It helps that the franchise 

brought in a visually talented 
director in Justin Lin (“Furious 
7”) to replace J.J. Abrams (who 
was busy making this little “Star 
Wars” film). The film’s action 
scenes crackled with excitement. 
As the camera swooped around 
the fighting, Lin made us feel a 
certain excitement, just like he 
did so well in the “Fast and Furi-
ous” movies he directed. This is 
especially true in Kall’s attack 
of the Enterprise. This sequence 
went on for multiple minutes, and 
were some of the most exciting 
moments in the movie.

Despite the movie being a 

goof watch, it wasn’t without its 
problems. The film didn’t really 
attempt to add much depth to the 
characters, something the first 
film did so well with the relation-
ship between Spock and Captain 
Kirk (Chris Pine, “Jack Ryan: 
Shadow Recruit”). Elba did what 
he could with the villain role, 
but the character doesn’t get any 
background until the film’s third 
act, and the twists felt like half-
hearted attempts at creating a 
character instead of a caricature.

Still, it’s easy to overlook how 

hard it is to make a competent 
summer blockbuster. This movie-
going season has been filled with 
efforts where the filmmakers 
clearly didn’t care. That makes 
“Star Trek” a refreshing breath 
of fresh air with its banter and 
incredible action scenes.

Gucci’s homecoming 
album a strong showing

Artist makes 
statement after 

release from prison

By ANAY KATYAL

Summer Senior Arts Editor

Gucci Mane’s propensity for 

trouble never really got in the way 
of his prolific music career. In his 
approximately 
2 years spent 
locked 
up 
at 

USP 
Terre 

Haute, 
Gucci 

released 
over 
twenty 

different 
projects, largely 
thanks 
to 
a 

backlog of old 
verses and an 
ever-so-loyal team of producers, 
artists and marketers behind him. 
After his various flirtations with 
the law and the dwindling image 
of his label and crew, the deluge of 
releases was a last-ditch attempt 
to maintain the artist’s relevancy 
as trap royalty — at least until he 
can go back to warming the throne 
himself. With millions parading 
#FreeGuwop all over Twitter 
as a gesture of support, Gucci 
and his team’s efforts didn’t go 
unheard, making the anticipation 
for Gucci’s first release post-
prison all the more sweet for 
his fans. Atlanta’s rap scene has 
seen an upheaval of sorts since 
Gucci’s incarceration, introducing 
newfound 
mainstream 
media 

attention and a smorgasbord of 
new players to the game. In the 
face of that, Gucci finds himself 
comfortably at home on Everybody 
Looking — a project that comes 
less than two months after his 
release. Despite some loose ends 
on the album, it’s as if he never left 
in the first place.

Helmed by Atlanta producers 

Zaytoven 
and 
Mike 
WiLL 

Made-It, Everybody Looking was 
tasked with the responsibility of 
ensuring fans (and quiet critics) 
that Gucci has yet to deviate from 
his form. With standout songs like 
“1st Day Out tha Feds” (initially 
released as a single) and “Guwop 
Home,” Everybody Looking packs 

a sonic punch, especially in the 
face his past two-to-three years 
of releases. Despite a steady flow 
of content while in prison, thanks 
to 
the 
haphazardly-slapped-

together nature of his many 
prison-era 
releases, 
a 
Gucci-

sized void was still glaringly 
present in Atlanta’s trap scene. 
The amalgamated image of what 
Gucci is as both a personality and 
a rapper slowly became muted in 
those absent years, taking away the 
authentic and bombastic aspects 
of his character from prominent 
public display. Everybody Looking 
eschews those mistakes, instead 
conveying Gucci in a light that 
wouldn’t be expected so soon 
after release from prison. He 
sounds clear, sober, healthy — but 
he also sounds strong, aggressive, 
and more full of life than ever. It’s 
the Gucci Mane we haven’t heard 
in years.

Despite Everybody Looking’s 

refreshing 
predisposition 

relative to Gucci’s past releases, 
it’s still necessary to observe 
the work through an objective 
lense. Gucci and his team’s past 
misjudgements don’t serve as a 
license for unabated praise. For 
all the charm Gucci serves on the 
record, the lack of aural variety 
can leave listeners longing for 
more. Zaytoven and Mike WiLL 
deliver with an arsenal of beats 
they had to have been saving for a 
project like this, but Gucci’s bars, 
as entertaining as they are, don’t 
seem to match the celebratory 
quality of production that backs 
them. Gucci isn’t known for 
being a master lyricist, but he’s 
had more memorable moments 
stringing together bars and verses 
on past tapes. Some fans might 

expect something next-level on 
a release like Everybody Looking, 
but those same fans probably have 
a history of having unreasonably 
high expectations too.

Even in the face of those 

critiques, Gucci’s homecoming 
project has an incomprehensibly 
charming gusto. Hearing Gucci 
happy, healthy and sober makes 
the 
album 
enjoyable 
purely 

on its own. It’s assurance that 
Atlanta’s rap godfather hasn’t 
left his patrons yet. It’s a promise 
that he has a lot more for us too. 
He makes playful and humorous 
jabs concerning his otherwise 
sordid 
upbringing, 
and 
he 

frames his rise to fame in ways 
that can only be described as 
fodder for inspiration. Gucci 
shows that prison matured him, 
both musically and personally, 
involving mainstream artists of 
rap’s new school with elements 
of the genre that Gucci can 
accurately call his own. It’s a 
message 
of 
redemption 
and 

success rather than simply being a 
piece of art — fitting, considering 
the kind of person Gucci is.

Everybody Looking isn’t Gucci’s 

magnum opus by any means. 
That’s probably not the point of 
it either, though. For an album 
hurriedly churned out in a matter 
of weeks, its quality exceeds the 
expectations it set for itself; for 
a rapper who’s had his fair share 
of trials and tribulations, it’s also 
an album that expresses a strong 
and resilient man whose best 
years are ahead of him rather 
than behind. Everybody Looking 
deserves a listen, not because it’s 
Gucci’s best yet, but because it’s a 
sobering message of the Gucci we 
have yet to see.

The versatile style of Hillary Clinton

STYLE NOTEBOOK

A chronicle of the 
candidate’s fashion 

over the years

By ANAY KATYAL and LYDIA 

MURRAY

Summer Senior Arts Editor and Daily 

Staff Reporter

Hillary Clinton’s wardrobe has 

been the talk of Washington media 
during this election cycle, but she’s 
no stranger to the commotion. From 
her years as First Lady to the advent 
of her political career, Hillary Clin-
ton has seen a variety of stylistic 
transformations, all equally iconic 
and defining for the time and era of 
her personal career.

Clinton has sported a variety of 

looks during her time in the public 
eye, each and every one distinctly 
representative of the role she’s had 
to play. During her time as First Lady 
of Arkansas, a primp and proper 
demeanor warranted a no-nonsense 
bob coupled with pinstripe dresses 
to humanize her to state constitu-
ents as she worked to bring atten-
tion to social issues such, including 
the Arkansas school system. As her 
husband took the Oval Office, Clin-
ton took to stronger, more assertive 
colors and silhouettes (later adopt-
ing her signature shortcut) as she 
took on nationally-defining initia-
tives, like helping to establish the 
Office on Violence Against Women. 
Pant suits of all types of colors 
become her norm as Clinton tried 
to level with her male counterparts 
in her run-up to becoming Senator 
of New York (and later Secretary of 
State under the Obama administra-
tion). But why the different phases? 
Was Clinton moving with the ever-
evolving psyche of fashion, or was 
there something more fundamental 
to her stylistic progression?

For men in business, dressing 

the part is a simple task. A well fit-
ted suit and tie largely does the 
trick when it comes to “professional 
dress.” For women, the decision 
is more nuanced, requiring many 
more moving parts. Skirt or pants? 
A solid color or patterned? Muted 
or bright colors? The most difficult 
aspect of this cascade of decisions is 
treading the fine line between look-
ing fashionable while maintaining 
professionalism (and avoiding any 
provocation).

Nina McLemore, CEO of Nina 

McLemore Designs — specializing 
in professional apparel for women 
— has styled many prominent 
female political figures today, Hill-
ary Clinton included. McLemore 
discussed this phenomenon in an 
interview with The Daily, speaking 
about the perfect balance required 
in today’s political landscape.

“This points to the divide, or fine 

line, I would say, that women walk 
between looking frumpy or dull and 
being too sexy,” she said. “It’s a very 
difficult line to manage.”

McLemore said, for Clinton, she 

does not have much time in her 
busy schedule to consider what she 
wears, but still needs to display an 
air of confidence in her attire.

“She doesn’t really have time to 

focus on her wardrobe,” she said. 
“She needs to wear clothes that are 
attractive but are also displaying 
confidence and power.”

Comparatively, McLemore said, 

Michelle Obama — a woman of 
similar education and means as 
Clinton — dresses in a more tradi-
tionally feminine way, largely as to 
not distract from President Barack 
Obama’s role as the dominant figure 
of the White House. Instead, she 
characterizes herself in a more sup-
portive and mothering light, a stark 
illustration of the difference in roles 
the two women play.

“Michelle is a very strong, very 

smart, very well educated woman,” 
she said. “My guess is that she has 
chosen to portray an image that is 
not so strong and not so hard edge 
… I think she wants to come off as 
a youthful, energetic mother rather 
than a strong powerful woman.”

Clinton has occupied both of 

these roles in her style. As First 
Lady of both the United States and 
Arkansas, Clinton’s look harkened 
back to days of Jackie Kennedy vibe, 
sporting skirt suits and dresses. She 
also opted for more feminine colors 
and patterns.

As First Lady, Clinton’s held a 

role of having to be a mother to her 
family, while simultaneously hav-
ing to convey aspects of that role in 
pronounced ways for the public eye. 
A shift came when Clinton’s politi-
cal aspirations came to fruition in 
the race for New York’s Senate seat. 
Suddenly, Clinton former image 
was exchanged for a persona that 
more assertively exuberated confi-
dence and professionalism.

In this stage, dresses were 

turned in for her signature famous 
bright pantsuits and strong red lip-
stick. Clinton went from embody-
ing Jackie Kennedy to channeling 
Angela Merkel, shifting her fashion 
as she changed roles.

Clinton’s style remained largely 

the same throughout her tenure 
as both Senator and Secretary of 
State. Her hair was kept longer than 
what she currently sports, and she 
often wore her hair tied up with 
a scrunchie. For Clinton, this was 
an easy fix to weathered hair after 

hours of travel when she had to look 
photo ready after spending hours on 
an airplane. It illustrated the weath-
ering aspects of her job at the time.

Per McLemore, hair is one of the 

most important aspects of a wom-
an’s look. For women with longer 
hair, she said, having a neat, up-do 
conveys the most professional and 
assertive look.

“I think it is much better if you 

have longer hair to pull it back or 
put it up,” she said. “And not have it 
hanging on the front of your jacket.”

Back on the campaign trail, 

Clinton once again rocks her short, 
fluffy cut and has kept the pantsuits 
— but with a twist. Clinton now 
employs an arsenal of designers and 
has shored up her wardrobe bud-
get to match — the New York Post 
reported that Clinton likely spent 
$200,000 on her campaign ward-
robe, including a $12,495 Giorgio 
Armani tweed jacket she wore for a 
speech about inequality.

However Clinton isn’t the first 

female politician to do so. According 
to the New York Post, Sarah Palin 
received $150,000 worth of cloth-
ing from the Republican National 
Committee while running for Vice 
President in 2008. It’s a challenge 
that crosses party lines.

Relative to Clinton’s world of 

ever-changing 
(and 
ever-scruti-

nized) style, there’s something to 
be said about the stylistic aspect 
(or lack thereof) in the lives of her 
male colleagues and counterparts. 
Donald Trump, her latest adver-
sary, seemingly does not exist in a 
world with the same pressures or 

expectations, illustrative of the dif-
ferent difficulties the two face when 
it comes to their approach toward 
the public eye. McLemore says she 
believes Trump has variations of 
only one suit.

“When I was looking at what 

Donald Trump wore, it appears to 
me that he has one style of suit,” she 
said. “He has a tailor that just makes 
it for him over and over again. He 
just changes the fabric for some. 
There is no uniform for women.

Politicians like Clinton seem-

ingly have to grapple with a kind of 
stigma unseen by their male coun-
terparts.

According to McLemore, humans 

are hardwired to immediately asso-
ciate power with male figures who 
are tall, handsome and dressed in 
a suit. Women, on the other hand, 
have to work to break this image.

“We have become to recognize 

the CEO as the person in the suit 
and the tie,” she said. “Women are 
not that image.”

And Clinton recognizes just 

that. Her stylistic progression is 
indicative of a woman whose self-
awareness has supplemented her 
career successes. The kinds of 
challenges she has had to face in 
her professional rise are far from 
the conventional tribulations male 
politicians face, and her answer 
to those challenges echo strongly 
for women who find themselves in 
a similar place. From her role as a 
doting and caring mother, her pub-
lic image experienced an upheav-
al in her transition to becoming 
the politician we know today.

Faculty will develop 
methods to better 
analyze patient data

By MAYA SHANKAR

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan 

School of Public Health has been 
named as one of the institutions 
to participate in the Data and 
Research 
Support 
Center, 
a 

program funded by the National 
Institutes of Health.

The program is part of a 

national 
project, 
announced 

by 
President 
Barack 
Obama 

in January 2015, called the 
Precision 
Medicine 
Initiative. 

Funded by the NIH, the initiative 
dedicates $55 million to help 
further research in the growing 
field of precision medicine.

Precision 
medicine 
— 

previously 
as 
personalized 

medicine — aims to treat diseases 
individually 
based 
on 
each 

patient’s lifestyle, medical history, 
environment and genetics. Using 
precision medicine, doctors can 
better create tailored treatment 
plans that are more effective 
and efficient for patients than 
those planned for the average 
population.

There are several components 

to the initiative: enroll one 
million participants, collect their 
genetic samples and health data, 
and make the data accessible to 
researchers and scientists. The 
University will work with several 
other institutions to develop 
ways to gather and organize the 
data from various participating 
health systems.

The program as a whole will 

also develop methods to analyze 
the data and protect the privacy 
of those who share it.

Goncalo Abecasis, chair of 

the 
University’s 
Biostatistics 

Department and the Felix E. 
Moore 
Collegiate 
Professor 

of 
Biostatistics, 
said 
the 

University’s particular role is 
to develop tools for scientists to 
better understand and use the 
collected data.

“We are part of a team 

that’s led out of Vanderbilt and 
Google,” Abecasis said. “They’re 
going to be organizing all the 
data and genetic information 
coming in from the different 
health systems. Our particular 
role is going to be to develop 
research tools that scientists can 
use to ask questions about the 
data. For example, they can log 
into a secure environment and 
explore the data and understand 
a specific connection between 
a certain gene and a certain 
disease.”

One reason the University 

was chosen to participate in the 
program is it’s role as a leader 
in precision medicine research, 
with current areas of expertise 
including 
precision 
oncology, 

drug development and targeted 
therapies, 
obesity 
research; 

health outcomes research and 
analysis; social research and 
new approaches to big data.

In addition, the University 

Health System is one of several 
major 
medical 
centers 
that 

gathers genetic data and relevant 
health information from patients 
who consent to share it for 
research purposes. For example, 
the 
Michigan 
Genomics 

Initiative — which began before 
the Precision Medicine Initiative 
was announce — has the genetic 
and medical information of more 
than 32,000 participants.

Abecasis said the Michigan 

Genomics Initiative was one 
of the reasons the University 
was chosen to participate in the 
project.

“I 
think 
specifically 
why 

we were selected is because 
the University has a history of 
developing research tools for 
using genetic data and making 
those 
tools 
available 
and 

accessible to the community,” 
he said. “For us, it is a great 
opportunity to be involved. For 
a lot of what we do in trying to 
understand human disease and 
human genetics, having a study 
of a million people connected to 
rich data is going to be the future 
and the start of many exciting 
things.”

regiment — more extensive than 
it’s necessary,” Katz said. “For 
years, we’ve been talking about 
overtreatment 
of 
cancer, 
or 

overtreatment of anything and 
often blaming the doctors and 
characterizing the doctor being 
too aggressive. In one thing I 
have researched and learned 
was that patient’s partner often 
would have the preference to 
treat more extensive than it’s 
clinically indicated.”

Katz believes patients who 

think more extensive treatment 
is better contributes to the rising 
rates of double mastectomies. He 
warned that extensive surgery, 
not just mastectomies, can lead 
to such side effects as life-long 
swelling of the arms.

Katz believes there is a more 

general problem: working with 
patients to counter the immediate 
reaction to a health threat.

There is an enormous need 

for clinicians to help navigate 
patients in their cancer treatment 
since the decision is much more 
complex than before, Katz stated. 
Though the tests for breast 
cancer usually can identify which 
patient can benefit from which 
treatment, in some situations, it 
is uncertain what the best course 
of action is. For such situations, 
he said, patients want to go for 
the more extensive treatment to 
go back to their normal routine 
or to assure themselves that they 
did everything they could.

“It is the kind of psychological 

factor that drive people to prefer 
the most aggressive treatment 
when in fact the most aggressive 
treatment 
will 
not 
improve 

their health, life expectancy or 

survival,” Katz said.

Katz 
believes 
doctors 
are 

trying 
to 
encourage 
less-

intensive treatments to prevent 
harm. Physicians recognize that 
treatment can harm and even kill 
patients, he said.

Sabel 
wrote 
that 
double 

mastectomies may, nevertheless, 
be the right decision in uncertain 
situations.

“The peace of mind (the 

psychological 
benefit) 
of 

bilateral mastectomies might be 
a sound decision for them. It is 
hard to say if it is ‘the best one’ 
and my job as a doctor isn’t to 
make those decisions for the 
patient, but to (educate) and 
advise them,” he wrote. “Clearly 
I try to steer patients away from 
poor decisions, but when two 
treatments have equal survivals, 
even if one is more ‘drastic’ it is 
hard to say it is a wrong decision.”

Sabel added that the key is to 

learn why a patient wishes to 
have a double mastectomy, while 
informing what will or will not 
work.

“So women who think they will 

live longer because they have this 
operation need more education,” 
Sabel wrote. “But many women 
are frightful of a (second) cancer, 
even if the risk is low, and the 
idea of yearly mammograms can 
be stressful, particularly if they 
get a call-back or need a biopsy.”

Ruth 
Freedman, 
chief 

administrator of the University’s 
Molecular 
and 
Behavioral 

Neuroscience Institute, is an 
advocate who leads the University 
Breast Cancer Advocacy and 
Advisory 
Committee. 
The 

committee has monthly meetings 
to provide the best information 
for breast cancer patients and 
survivors, helping them with 
their decisions.

The committee aims to clarify 

facts so that patients understand 
their 
best 
course 
of 
action 

and 
become 
knowledgeable 

advocates. The committee also 
communicates 
regularly 
with 

researchers from organizations, 
such as the American Cancer 
Society, to give them feedback 
on their work and clinical trials 
on how it would affect their 
patients.

While 
acknowledging 
that 

the chance cancer can spread 
from one breast to the other 
breast is little and thus a double 
mastectomy may be unnecessary, 
Freedman 
emphasized 
the 

decision is ultimately left to the 
patient.

“For 
them, 
given 
their 

situation, (double mastectomy) 
may be the best course of 
treatment if they are young 
women or single moms,” she 
said. “Or if their own emotional 
status is one that they can’t live 
with the possibility of cancer in 
the other breast, even if it could 
go elsewhere as well, it’s not 
necessarily a guard against any 
other breast cancer.”

When it comes to decision 

making, 
Katz 
recommended 

patients 
not 
make 
rushed 

decisions. He stated that, being 
diagnosed with breast cancer 
is not a medical emergency, so 
patients should take the time 
to think, gather information 
and 
make 
careful 
decisions 

with their physicians. Patients 
should also find out rationales 
for 
recommendations, 
he 

emphasized, and be satisfied 
with them.

Along 
with 
the 
cognizant 

patients, 
doctors 
should 
be 

mindful of the patients and keep 
themselves updated on their 
patients, he added.

understandable. 
The 
idea 
that 

“Clinton won fair and square” 
is kind of out the window at this 
point after it was revealed that the 
party put its finger on the scale for 
Clinton. It’s difficult for many to see 
the nomination as legitimate.”

Kolenda added that he is unsure 

of exact numbers, but the support 
among members of his organization 
is divided, with many going in both 
directions.

With Michigan coming into 

greater play this election season, 
the turnout of students and whom 
they support will play an important 
role. Sanders, who endorsed Clinton 
earlier this month, has called upon 
his supporters to rally behind 
Clinton, but to little avail. Monday 
morning, he was booed when 
addressing fans when he requested 
that they stand behind the party’s 
nominee.

Protesters, when asked about 

Sanders’ endorsement of Clinton, 
had a common response, stating 
their movement is about more than 
Sanders. Green said she believes 
there needs to be change on a 
grander scale and people should not 
have to choose between only two 
candidates.

“We need to be the change,” she 

said. “That’s the bigger umbrella 
reason of why I’m here. Bernie 
Sanders is amazing, but he’s one 
person, and we all need to be in this 
together. … We believe that this is 
not the end and we do not have to 
choose between the lesser of two 
evils.”

Kolenda 
agreed 
with 
this 

sentiment, 
saying 
that 
the 

movement has become larger than 
just the presidential election and 
students.

“Sanders was incredibly popular 

with most people under 45,” he 
wrote. “He came incredibly close 
to the nomination, even with the 
DNC actively trying to harm his 
campaign ... There are also many 
Sanders supporters (some I know 
personally) who are now running 
for office. The movement is more 
than just young college students.”

Despite the large crowds of 

protestors at the convention, and 
the overarching movements, many 
still believe students will rally 
behind Clinton.

University Public Policy lecturer 

Rusty Hill said he believes most 
students will vote for Clinton, while 
those who will vote third party or 
for Trump will stem more from 
young working people.

“I think there is a divide among 

young people,” he said. “On college 
campuses, the youth that vote will 
overwhelmingly 
for 
Secretary 

Clinton, but among non-college 
youth, 
those 
people 
that 
are 

working, trying to scratch some jobs 
together, there may be some ground 
for a Trump or third-party vote.”

Kelly agreed with this sentiment, 

stating he believes students on 
campus will rally behind Clinton, 
with only a few stragglers voting 
third party.

“Sen. Sanders knows himself that 

it’s about the movement, not just 
one person,” he said. “I think we 
will see a lot of his supporters start 
going the fold and getting excited 
about electing Clinton.”

The incumbent Warpehoski — 

who is the director of the local 
Interfaith Council for Peace & 
Justice — held his City Council 
seat since 2012 and disagrees 
with Leeser’s assessment of city 
affairs. While he acknowledges 
Leeser holds positions aligned 
with many locals, Warpehoski 
argues he pragmatically accounts 
for both his constituents’ needs 
and the opinions of experts.

“The role of elected officials 

is to listen to everybody, the 
constituents as well as the subject 
matter experts — the traffic 
engineers, the attorney — taking 
all of that in and making the 
best decision for the good of the 
community,” Warpehoski said. 
“It’s not always governing by the 

poll numbers. It’s not about doing 
whatever the experts say; it’s 
about bringing that all together 
into a holistic approach to public 
service.”

While 
Leeser 
has 
been 

outspoken in arguing the Ann 
Arbor deer cull has been a waste 
of city resources, Warpehoski 
maintains the opinion of expert 
ecologists in his support for a 
continued lethal cull. Leeser 
supports immediate action to 
petition for EPA intervention 
on the Gelman dioxane plume 
— a widely debated city issue — 
while Warpehoski insists city 
and county authorities pursue 
the federal option only if it can 
be better handled by federal 
authorities than by Michigan’s 
environmental regulators.

Abby Cole joining basketball
team for 2016-2017 season

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Editor

Abby Cole’s plan to play basket-

ball for the Wolverines hasn’t ran 
into any snags. 
Michigan 
vol-

leyball’s 6-foot-5 
senior made the 
announcement 
that she would 
play 
basketball 

this 
upcoming 

season 
on 
her 

Instagram 
in 

November, 
but 

the move was just 
made official Thursday.

“Following the holiday break 

during my sophomore year, I had 
some honest conversations with 
(volleyball 
head 
coach) 
Mark 

Rosen,” Cole told MGoBlue. “He 
was very supportive of my desire to 
play basketball again, knowing that 
my commitment to the volleyball 
program would not waiver. Mark 
connected me with Coach Arico, 
and when she offered me the chance 
to continue my basketball career, I 
could not turn her down.”

Cole will finish her final sea-

son of volleyball as one of the team 

captains. The AVCA Second Team 
All-American just received LeBron 
James-esque treatment by having 
her likeness on an enormous poster 
on the outside of Cliff Keen Arena. 

After the upcom-
ing 
volleyball 

season, Cole will 
join Kim Barnes 
Arico’s 
squad 

and 
then 
will 

have 
another 

year of eligibility 
left to solely play 
hoops during the 
2017-18 season.

“Her 
length 

is incredible, and she moves so 
well for her size,” 
Arico said in an 
interview 
with 

MGoBlue. 
“She 

is an elite-level 
athlete who will 
bring 
another 

dimension to our 
team. When she 
approached 
me 

about playing bas-
ketball, I was thrilled. She will be 
an amazing ambassador for our pro-
gram.”

In Cole’s senior year of high 

school in 2013, she was named 
Class A Player of the Year for basket-
ball and was a Miss Basketball final-
ist. She racked up two state titles for 
Grand Haven High School and aver-
aged 13.9 points, 9.6 rebounds and 
7.9 blocks per game as a senior. She 
will play center alongside 6-foot-5 
sophomore center Hallie Thome, 
giving the Wolverines more of a 
punch down low.

This summer, Cole has played 

for the U.S. Collegiate National 
Volleyball Team in China. She 
was just named tournament MVP 
while averaging 11.25 kills per 
match. She is dominating in vol-
leyball at the moment, but will be 

brushing up on 
her basketball 
skills once vol-
leyball season 
ends. With her 
being one of 
Michigan’s best 
high 
school 

basketball play-
ers just three 
years ago, she’ll 

be a helpful addition to the wom-
en’s basketball team that reached 
the WNIT semifinal in each of the 
last two seasons.

“(Rosen) was very 
supportive of my 

desire to play 

basketball again.”

“Her length is 

incredible and she 

moves well.”

 The Wolverines will be heading to New York for the fifth straight season.

Non-conference 
schedule released

By ETHAN WOLFE 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Wednesday, the Michigan bas-

ketball team’s 14-game non-con-
ference schedule was released, and 
like last season, it features lackluster 
competition.

This season’s exhibition game 

against Armstrong State on Nov. 
4 will include another matchup 
that holds ties to head coach John 
Beilein. In last season’s exhibition, 
the Wolverines hosted Le Moyne, 
where Beilein used to coach and 
where his son Patrick currently 
reigns as the head coach. Against 
Armstrong State, former Michi-
gan basketball star Cazzie Russell 
returns to Ann Arbor as the current 
assistant coach for the Pirates,

The Wolverines’ regular season 

non-conference slate, though fac-
ing marginally stronger opponents 
according to the ratings percentage 
index, will see another weak home 
schedule: Texas (Dec. 6) and Virgin-
ia Tech (Nov. 30) are the lone teams 
in the RPI’s top 100 that Michigan 
will host, with the matchup against 
the Hokies being apart of the ACC/
Big Ten Challenge.

The Wolverines’ opening games 

against Howard (Nov. 11) and IUPUI 
(Nov. 13) in Ann Arbor will take place 
as a part of the 2K Classic. Follow-
ing those two games, Michigan will 
fly out to New York City to Madison 
Square Garden for the 2K Classic 
Championship Round. There, the 

Wolverines will square up against 
Marquette (Nov. 17) and either Pitts-
burgh or SMU (Nov. 18) in the cham-
pionship or consolation game.

Perhaps some of Michigan’s most 

competitive non-conference games 
will occur on the road against South 
Carolina (Nov. 23) and UCLA (Dec. 
10). Both teams missed last year’s 
NCAA Tournament, but the Game-
cocks are currently ranked No. 72 in 
the RPI.

The rest of the non-conference 

games include home matchups 
versus Mount St. Mary’s (Nov. 26), 
Kennesaw State (Dec. 3), Central 
Arkansas (Dec. 13), Maryland East-
ern Shore (Dec. 17) and Furman 
(Dec. 22).

Though the home games seem 

unexciting, Beilein is excited about 
many of the games the Wolverines 
managed to land.

“We were successful in schedul-

ing some very competitive home-
and-home games for 2016,” Beilein 
said in a statement. “These games 
not only guarantee a strong RPI 
but provide our fans some excit-
ing non-conference games in Ann 
Arbor. These types of opponents 
have always proved to be excellent 
preparation for our tough Big Ten 
schedule.”

Barring any upsets in their non-

conference schedule, Michigan will 
likely have to repeat what it did last 
season against Big Ten opponents 
to secure another spot in the NCAA 
Tournament.

Finn, ‘M’ address 
past inequalities 

The senior delivered 
new varsity jackets 
to several alumni

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

A glance at the two Michi-

gan varsity jackets lying side-
by-side was all 
anyone 
need-

ed to realize 
something was 
wrong.

One 
jacket, 

given to former 
male athletes, 
features a block 
M 
displayed 

in the normal 
hue of maize 
that those who 
watch Michigan athletics have 
come accustomed to seeing. The 
other jacket, given to former 
women athletes who played on 
varsity teams from 1973 to 1991, 
features a smaller, darker block 
M — along with sleeves that are 
a different color from the first 
jacket.

To former Wolverines, many 

of whom brought up the issue 
throughout the years, this dis-
crepancy 
in 
varsity 
jackets 

wasn’t just a matter of a differ-
ence in design — it was a matter 
of equality.

Erin Finn, a senior track-and-

field athlete, 
first 
found 

out about the 
inequity 
as 

a 
freshman 

when 
she 

attended 
a 

panel on the 
issue and was 
immediately 
drawn 
in. 

She persisted 
in 
remind-

ing people of the issue, and she 
asked for something to be done.

And when Michigan Athletic 

Director Warde Manuel decid-
ed that it was time for the ath-
letic department to correct its 
past mistake, Finn was one of 
the people contacted, because 
of her previous efforts.

She was asked to write a let-

ter to the women who would 
receive the new jackets, and 
was also tasked with delivering 
the new and improved varsity 
jackets to local alumni starting 
in July — something that was a 
unique experience in itself.

“Most of them don’t cry, 

but you can tell they’re trying 
to hold back teary-eyed emo-

tion,” 
Finn 

said. “They get 
this completely 
joyful 
smile. 

They’re just so 
happy to finally 
have their jack-
et. It’s like now 
they’re finally 
accepted. It’s a 
wonderful feel-
ing 
for 
them 

and 
you 
can 

tell that they’re just so excited, 
so happy and so thankful that 
Michigan did the right thing.”

Finn, one of several return-

ing veterans for the Wolverines 
next year, used the opportu-
nity as a chance to educate her 
teammates.

“I’ve been trying to let every-

one know that things haven’t 
always been as good as they 
have now,” Finn said. “Women 
didn’t always have equal oppor-
tunities. I’ve just been remind-
ing everyone how lucky we 
are and trying to get (people) 
involved in helping hand out 

the 
jackets 
so 

they can see on a 
first-hand level 
how lucky we 
really are.

“It’s 
an 

incredible 
honor. 
I 
can’t 

even 
begin 
to 

express 
my 

thanks to these 
women for set-
ting the prec-

edent of what it means to be a 
Michigan woman and opening 
these opportunities that we get 
to experience today because of 
what they went through. To be 
able to thank them myself and 
to see the joy on their faces 
when they received their jack-
ets was so, so special. I can’t 
even put it into words.”

Notebook: Harbaugh, Big Ten 

coaches address media in Chicago

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

CHICAGO 
— 
Monday, 
six 

coaches took the podium at Big Ten 
Media Days to give their opening 
remarks, but the Wolverines were 
discussed in more than just Michi-
gan coach Jim Harbaugh’s Q&A 
session.

The Michigan football team 

kicks off its conference schedule on 
Sept. 24, when the Nittany Lions 
travel to Michigan Stadium, but 
the competition is already starting 
to heat up.

NO 
RUTGERS 
RIVALRY 

“YET”: After Michigan plucked a 
few prized recruits from the state 
of New Jersey last spring (includ-
ing No. 1 recruit Rashan Gary), Rut-
gers’ and the Wolverines’ fan bases 
butted heads on social media. 

First-year Scarlet Knights coach 

Chris Ash, who served as Ohio 
State’s co-defensive coordinator 
prior to arriving in Piscataway, 
was asked about the fan rivalry 
between the two teams.

“I’ll start by saying there’s no 

rivalry with Michigan yet,” Ash 
said. “They’ve done some things 
that we have not been able to do, 
and I think it’s great when fans get 
a chance in the offseason to talk 
about college football and have 
fun with college football. I have a 
tremendous amount of respect for 
Coach Harbaugh and the job he’s 

done at Michigan and the program 
they’ve had for several years.”

PEPPERS MAKES PREASE-

ASON WATCH LIST: Redshirt 
sophomore linebacker Jabrill Pep-
pers was named on the East Divi-
sion Big Ten Football Preaseason 
Watch List along with Michigan 
State’s Malik McDowelll, Ohio 
State’s J.T. Barrett and Raekwon 
McMillan and Penn State’s Saquon 
Barkley. 

Harbaugh had nothing but good 

things to say about Peppers, listing 
him as a multi-threat player. 

“He can play just about any-

where on a football field and be 
effective,” Harbaugh said. “Put 
him in a corner, put him in a safe-
ty. Put him in a nickel. Put him in 
a linebacker. Ultimately probably 
nickel is his best position. He can 
be a returner of the punts, returner 
of the kickoffs. He could be a gun-
ner. He could be a hold-up guy. 
Offensively probably right now 
could probably be our slot receiver 
and would give De’Veon and all of 
our running backs a run for their 
money to be the best running back 
on the team. Could be a wildcat 
quarterback. Could be an outside 
receiver. Can run all the reverses 
and fly sweeps.

“So I think you get the picture. 

He is a tremendous athlete.”

FITZGERALD REMEMBERS 

SHUTOUT: After leading the 
Wildcats to a 6-2 Big Ten record 

last season, Northwestern coach 
Pat Fitzgerald gave a nod to Michi-
gan, which handed the Wildcats 
one of its two in-conference losses. 
The Wolverines shut out then-No. 
13 Northwestern 38-0 at the Big 
House, resulting in the Wildcats’ 
worst loss of the season. 

“I thought (Michigan) played 

outstanding,” Fitzgerald said on 
Monday. “When you get on the bus 
and you pop the tape on that’s the 
first thing you do as a coach. You 
pop on the tape and you go: ‘We 
should have done A, B, C.’ But wow 
do they do it well. And you tip your 
hat and you move on, get ready for 
the next week.”

CHESSON CHECK-UP: After 

being sidelined in spring practice 
due to a leg injury, fifth-year senior 
wide receiver Jehu Chesson is 
expected to be healthy by the start 
of fall practice, which starts on 
Aug. 8.

Chesson will have some healthy 

competition at the position with 
fifth-year senior Amara Darboh, 
who Harbaugh now believes is 
Michigan’s top receiver.

“Amara Darboh, I would say 

he’s our top receiver right now,” 
Harbaugh said. “And as we went 
through the season last year, I 
thought that was Jehu Chesson. 
And then Amara surged during 
spring ball there, and they’re in 
a very good-hearted competition 
there to be our best receiver.”

FOOTBALL
‘M’ embracing a 
higher standard

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

CHICAGO — For the second 

straight year, Jim Harbaugh walked 
into the Hyatt Regency McCormick 
Place as the center of attention.

Still sporting his signature skin-

ny block ‘M’ hat despite wearing a 
full suit, the second-year Michigan 
football coach was the main attrac-
tion of the first day of Big Ten Media 
Days, with a throng of cameras and 
microphones swarming his podium 
in a hotel ballroom.

Such attention is probably to be 

expected given the social media 
buzz that surrounded Harbaugh 
since his hiring back in Dec. 2014, 
but this year’s circus came with one 

major difference. After a 10-3 inau-
gural campaign featuring a 41-7 

throttling of Florida in the Citrus 
Bowl and the narrowest of losses to 
eventual playoff-bound rival Michi-
gan State, expectations are through 
the roof.

“We raised the bar when we 

played Florida,” said senior tight 
end Jake Butt. “That’s now ground 
zero. ... I don’t think we’re chasing 
anybody.”

The Wolverines are ranked in 

the top 10 in most preseason polls 
released to date, with USA Today 
placing them as high as third — 
trailing only the final two teams 
standing last season, Clemson and 
Alabama. Among Big Ten foes, most 
of the polls have only Ohio State 
ranked ahead of Michigan, with 
Michigan State and Iowa a few steps 
below.

As expected, neither Harbaugh 

nor the players joining him in Chi-
cago on Monday would say they pay 
attention to the hype, but none were 
too shy to admit they had equally 
high hopes.

“The message is simple: We want 

our dreams to be big,” Harbaugh 
said. “We want our goals to be lofty 
— so much that people will laugh at 
us. If they’re not laughing at us, we 
didn’t set high enough goals. (We 
also have to) understand that they 
can be achieved, but they have to be 
worked for. Such a simple message, 
but it just might work.”

With a pair of first-team All-

Americans in Butt and senior cor-
nerback Jourdan Lewis, a wealth 
of experience on both sides of the 

ball and do-it-all players like red-
shirt sophomore linebacker Jabrill 
Peppers, it’s not hard to see why 
the bar is being raised.

“We can contend for (a cham-

pionship), of course,” Lewis said. 
“We have the talent, we have the 
young guys to come in and help us 
out, we have the coaching staff. We 
have everything in place to be one 
of those programs to say we can 
contend for a Big Ten or (national) 
championship.”

Media days are typically brim-

ming with optimism for every 
team, but the Wolverines have 
drawn theirs not only from their 
10 wins last season, but the way 
they rebounded from tough losses. 
Michigan won the next game fol-
lowing each of its three losses in 
2015 — the first time since 2011 the 
Wolverines had completed a sea-
son without losing back-to-back 
games.

Part of the Wolverines’ resil-

iency came from their new coach’s 
attitude, which the players noticed 
right away.

“In past years, when we lost, one 

loss would turn into two or three 
losses, and everyone would be down 
on themselves,” Butt said. “You 
could kind of feel we were lean-
ing towards that when we got in 
the locker room (after last season’s 
opening loss to Utah), but Coach 
Harbaugh looked at all of us and 
crushed that right then and there.

“He told us he was proud of us, 

he was proud of the way we played, 
and that we’re gonna be just fine 
going down the stretch. And we all 
believed him, we all bought into him 
at that point. It was such a different 
feeling.”

After the triumph in the Citrus 

Bowl, the feeling has carried over 
into 2016. Though Harbaugh is 0-2 
against Michigan State and Ohio 
State and the Wolverines haven’t 
won a Big Ten title since 2004, the 
team is starting to think that their 
coach — with all of his eccentricities 
and his media circus — might be the 
person that can bring them back to 
the top.

“It’s madness, it’s genius,” Lewis 

said. “It’s a fine line between crazy 
and genius. You can see it — he has a 
method to his madness. Everything 
is calculated, everything he does is 
for a reason.”
