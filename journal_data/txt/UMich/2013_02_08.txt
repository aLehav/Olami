ADMISSIONS
Group to
push for
aff. action
review
BAMN endorses
AG's petition to
U.S. Supreme Court
By BEN ATLAS
Daily Staff Reporter
With a potential turn in federal affir-
mative action policy on the horizon, the
University and state of Michigan may
once again be at the center of it all.
The Coalition to Defend Affirmative
Action, Integration & Immigrant Rights
and Fight for Equality By Any Means
Necessary has endorsed Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette's request
that the nation's highest court review
the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals'
decision to overturn Proposal 2 - the
state's 2006 ban on affirmative action
in admissions. The move comes as a sur-
prise as the parties are on opposite sides
of the issue.
George Washington, BAMN's coun-
sel of record, said the group has asked
the court for areview in hopes that they
might also strike down bans similar to
Proposal 2 in states such as California,
Arizona and Washington. The ultimate
goal of the group is to establish a new
national precedent in support of affir-
mative action.
After the Sixth Circuit Court first
overturned Proposal 2 in an 8-7 deci-
sion last October, Schuette petitioned
the Supreme Court.in November in an
attempt to reverse the lower court's
decision altogether.
If the U.S. Supreme Court decides
not to take the case, the lower court's
ban on Proposal 2 will be upheld, and
the University will be free to consider
affirmative action - consideration that
Washington said BAMN will demand.
If the court does take the case, Wash-
ington believes it will become "the most
important civil rights case in the coun-
try, by really along shot."
University alum Kate Stenvig, a
BAMN organizer, said the University

UnConference eschews
ususal agenga in favor
of looser meetings
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily Staff Reporter
When brainstorming is driven by
the piercing sound of a steam whis-
tie, there are bound to be interesting
results.
Students and professional entre-
preneurs gathered in the North Cam-
pus Research Complex Thursday for
"unConference," a non-traditional
forum in which participants were free
to suggest topics of discussion on cur-
rent economic challenges.
The event's organizers hoped par-
ticipants would thrive on its lack of
formal structure and philosophy of
free expression. After a short introduc-
tion to kick off the event, participants
were encouraged to brainstorm ideas
or topics and eventually present them
to the group of over 250 attendees.
An idea board dominated the front
of the room, covered in a colorful array

of paper notes representing a huge
variety of discussion topics. The top-
ics would be used as fuel for discussion
within smaller groups.
When it was time to move along, a
steam whistle signaled participants
to wrap up their conversations and
continue to the next idea. The whistle
was made by Maker Works, an Ann-
Arbor-based workshop for craftsmen
and designers.
UnConference was hosted by
Entrepreneurs Engage, a collabora-
tion between the University's Tech-
nology Transfer and the Michigan
Venture Capital Association. Both of
these organizations aim to develop and
market new technology as well as to
encourage venture capital in the com-
munity.
This year's conference was a contin-
uation from the inaugural conference
last June in which Governor Rick Sny-
der spoke about burgeoning business
opportunities in the state,
Funding for the event.was provided
by the Michigan Economic Develop-
ment Corporation, a statewide eco-
nomic development organization.
Kenneth Nisbet, the executive

director of Tech Transfer, said people
were encouraged to "come without an
agenda."
This year's event expanded its dura-
tion and the number of invitees over
last year. This year there were three
different sessions in which groups
could gather to discuss their ideas; up
from two last year. UnConference invi-
tations were also extended to student
entrepreneurs.
"The University is a great resource
to improve the entrepreneurial eco-
system," Nisbet said. "And the student
entrepreneurial culture here is great."
Nisbet also said that a big goal of
unConference is building relationships
between professional and student
entrepreneurs.
Engineering senior Rama Mwenesi,
a student entrepreneur and the presi-
dent and founder of E-Magine, learned
from his project that common motiva-
tions can make ateam of very different
specialists successful.

neurial organization that is working

Up-and-coming
vocalist to revive
sounds of Django
Reinhardt
By JOHN BOHN
Daily Arts Writer
In 1930s France, guitarist Django
Reinhardt and violinist Stephane
Grappelli pioneered a style of jazz
known as gypsy swing. As a self-pro-
claimed gypsy himself, Reinhardt
drew on his background with gypsy
music culture to create the unique
sound now heard internationally
among groups called "hot clubs,"
named after Reinhardt's original
Quintet du Hot Club de France.
This Friday, gypsy jazz will be in
full swing at the Kerrytown Con-
cert House, where Cyrille Aimee, an
up-and-coming voice in the genre,
will perform with her newly formed
band, The Guitar Heroes.
Aimee's story takes her close to
the roots of gypsy jazz mov'ement.
Born in Reinhardt's hometown
of Fontainebleau, Aimee became
acquainted with the style at an early
age. Gypsy culture persists into
the modern day with an estimated

500,000 Romas living in France,
and since 1968 - 15 years after
Reinhardt's death - enthusiasts
and descendants of the culture have
gathered in Samois-sur-Seine near
Fountainebleau to commemorate
the pioneer's life and legacy through
a yearly music festival.
"I started singing when I first
met the gypsies,"Aimee said."I was
obsessed with the gypsies and their
way of living and their culture."
Over the past decade, this style of
music has flourished, especially in
American cities like San Francisco
and Austin, Texas. Detroit has its
very own group of musicians, the
Hot Club of Detroit, which regu-
larly performs gypsy jazz in south-
east Michigan, as well as across the
country.
"They were one of the first to
make a career like this, just with
this music," said Kerrytown Con-
cert House Director Deanna Relyea.
She added that the group enjoys
playing in Ann Arbor.
"They call twice a year, three
times a year, depending on whether
they are in town," Relyea said."And
the audience is crazy for it, and they
always do something different."
It was with the Hot Club of
Detroit that Aim~e made her first

NRA head: Congress
won't pass gun control

S

Says action in the
House unlikely
under GOP
DENVER (AP) - The head of
the National Rifle Association
said Thursday he's confident
that Congress won't approve an
assault weapons ban or a limit
on high-capacity ammunition
magazines after mass shootings
in Colorado and Connecticut.
David Keene predicted fail-
ure for all congressional mea-
sures related to guns, including
expanded background checks
for gun purchases.
"I tell you what these things
are. These are all feel-good pro-
posals, because at the end of the
day, what do they do to prevent"
a mass shooter? asked Keene,
the NRA's president.
Keene was in Denver to talk
to Colorado's Democratic gov-

ernor, John Hickenlooper, and
state lawmakers. He met with
The Associated Press for an
interview before sitting down
with state officials. He talked
about prospects for federal gun
control measures under discus-
sion in Congress and predicted
political peril for Democrats who
support such bills.
"The Senate's where the
action's going to be," Keene said.
"The House is sort of sitting
back, and you can almost hear
the House Republican leadership
saying under their breath, 'You
know, go ahead. We've got a few
members that wouldn't mind sit-
ting in the Senate. If you do this,
maybe they will.' So the Senate
leadership is much more cau-
tious."
Colorado U.S. Sen. Mark
Udall, a Democrat, said he dis-
agreed with Keene's assertion
that Congress would do nothing.
"In the wake of recent mass

S H,-

shootings, including one in Colo-
rado, the status quo on gun vio-
lence is simply unacceptable,"
Udall said in a statement. "Colo-
radans expect and deserve bet-
ter than continued inaction from
Congress. I simply disagree that
Congress cannot or should not
try to reduce mass shootings and
gun violence."
In recent weeks, Keene has
become an increasingly pub-
lic figure for the powerful
gun rights group in the ongo-
ing debate on gun control. He
has offered a softer, if equally
staunch voice for the gun lobby's
ideas as compared with Wayne
LaPierre, the fiery executive
vice president who remains the
NRA's most prominent voice on
the public stage.
Keene has been active with
the NRA for decades, starting
as a board member before being
elected the group's president in
2011.

Former police
officer suspected
of killing three
LOS ANGELES (AP) - An
ex-Los Angeles police officer
who authorities say went on
a deadly shooting rampage to
punish those he blamed for his
firing killed three people, set-
ting off a manhunt that stirred
fear across several states and
Mexico.
The search for Christopher
Dorner focused late Thurs-
day on Big Bear Lake, about 80
miles east of Los Angeles, where
police found a burned-out pick-
up truck that belonged to Chris-
topher Dorner. San Bernardino
County Sheriff John McMahon
said officers were going door to
door looking for him.
Throughout the day, thou-
sands of heavily armed officers
patrolled highways in the state,
while some stood guard outside
the homes of people police say
Dorner vowed to attack in an
angry rant posted online. Elec-
tronic billboards that usually
alert motorists about the com-
mute urged them to call 911 if
they saw him.
"I will bring unconventional

and asymmetrical warfare" to
Los Angeles Police Department
officers, on or off duty, said
the manifesto. It also asserted:
"Unfortunately, I will not be
alive to see my name cleared.
That's what this is about, my
name. A man is nothing without
his name."
Dorner, 33, had multiple
weapons including an assault
rifle, said Los Angeles police
Chief Charlie Beck, who urged
him to surrender at an unusual
press conference in an under-
ground room at police head-
quarters where there was more
security than normal.
"Of course he knows what
he's doing, we trained him. He
was also a member of the Armed
Forces," he said."It is extremely
worrisome and scary."
The nearly 10,000-member
LAPD dispatched some of its
officers to protect more than
40 potential targets across
the region on Thursday. The
department also pulled officers
from motorcycle duty, fearing
they would make for easy tar-
gets.
"I never had the opportunity
to have a family of my own, I'm
terminating yours," the mani-
festo said.
At one point, officers guard-

ing one location mistakenly
opened fire on a pickup truck
believing it matched the
description of Dorner's dark col-
ored 2005 Nissan Titan, injur-
ing two innocent occupants.
The chief said there had been
a "night of extreme tragedy in
the Los Angeles area" and that
the department was taking mea-
sures to ensure the safety of offi-
cers and their families.
The search for Dorner, who
was fired from the LAPD in2008
for making false statements,
began after he was linked to a
weekend killing in which one of
the victims was the daughter of
a former police captain who had
represented him during the dis-
ciplinary hearing.
Monica Quan and her fiance,
Keith Lawrence, were found
shot in their car at a parking
structure at their condominium
on Sunday in Irvine. Quan, 28,
was an assistant women's bas-
ketball coach at Cal State Fuller-
ton. Lawrence, 27, was a public
safety officer at the University
of Southern California.
Police said Dorner implicated
himself in the couple's killings
in the manifesto posted on Face-
book. They believe he wrote it
because there were details in it
only he would know.

The last few performances the
club hosted, the group brought
a musician. Each time, the
concert has sold out. Aimde's
appearance met a similar
reception.
"Remembering her visit
here, she's kind of all about
her music," Relyea said. "She's
a nice person. She's a serious
musician."
The inclusion of Aimee in
the Hot Club's performance
made perfect sense. Both of
their styles can be described
by their occasional departures
from the typical Django Rein-
hardt format.
"(The Hot Club players) have
an adventuresome tendency so
that it's not all what Django and
Grappelli were playing," Relyea
said. "It's that, plus a different
angle. They go off into a free-
style for a minute, and then
come back. These are all very
great musicians and they play
in all sorts of styles."
"She's very imaginative.
She's not your usual stand-up-
and-sing crooner," she added.
Not only will Aimee perform
her own original material,
she's also brought together her
own band that showcases the
uniqueness of her taste.

ment," Aimee said. "So, I- put
together a band where there
were different styles of guitar-
ists ... So, it's going to be gypsy
swing with jazz and Latin
rhythms."
This will be the first tour
for Cyrille Aimee and The
Guitar Heroes. The band
is currently working on an
album together, the material
of which can be heard at its
performances.
In addition to this medley
of guitar styles, the band will
include more songs in French
and a recent development in
Aimee's repertoire: the use of a
loop pedal.
"I always imagined that this
thing existed," Aimde said.
"And, then, when I saw a guitar
player using it, I went out and
bought one."
Aimdeeuses the pedal to build
up chords on stage, as well as
provide her own backbeat. The
loop pedal merges newer tech-
nology with this older cultural
style, but, even with this fusion,
the lifestyle of the gypsies will
never be lost for Aimee.
"For the gypsies, the music
is a part of their everyday life,"
Aimee said. "They can't live
without it. They always have
their guitar on them. It's not
like a jazz piano trio. The music
is there all the time. We're eat-
ing, and they take the guitar
out and then lunch becomes a
big jam. Same for dinner."

in spending, focuses mainly on
health benefits, pre-elementary
education and rebuilding trans-
portation infrastructure.
The budget calls for a modest
2-percent appropriations increase
to the state's public colleges and
universities, provided they meet
the standards set by the state and
limit tuition hikes. The increase
comes after the governor's major
cuts to higher-education funding
in the last two years.
"A second year of increased
state appropriations would help
keep state funding for higher edu-
cation moving in the right direc-
tion," University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said in a statement.
"We also applaud the governor
for recommending that this year's
one-time funding become part of.
the base funding for the coming
year," he added.
Under the proposed budget,
the state will also distribute up to
$100 million in bonds to univer-
sities that aim to increase engi-
neering student enrollment and
graduation rates. Community col-
leges can compete for up to $50
million in bonds for graduating

Washington said Michigan's
constitutional amendment and
California's Proposition 209 have
had "devastating consequences"
on minority enrollment in each
state's public universities. From
2005 to 2012, the University saw
a 42-percent decline in enrollment
of underrepresented minorities
in LSA and a 20-percent decline
in the College of Engineering.
During that same time frame,
the School of Dentistry, the Law
School and the Medical School

The budget also includes an
increase of $44 in per-pupil fund-
ing for K-12 students, and $400
million for school districts to
defray retirement costs.
Snyder will also seek to add $65
million in funding for the Great
Start Readiness Program, which
focuses on pre-elementary educa-
tion and preparing the underpriv-
ileged youth for school.
Within the proposal is a plan
to create a new health savings
fund that will collect money to
pay for future costs of care. Sny-
der's office released a fact sheet
on Wednesday that indicated the
fund would help Michigan avoid-
covering additional costs until
about 2034.
The budget also calls for an
increase in Medicaid coverage
that would result in an estimated
46-percent drop in uninsured
citizens.
Snyder also laid out plans for
a $1.2-billion increase in funding
for transportation, financed by a
higher tax on gasoline.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said Snyder's appropria-
tion to higher education is not up
to par with other states.
"As far as just the macro level -
a small increase for higher educa-
tion given the very large decrease
that he provided back in 2011 -
have experienced 84-, 41- and
63-percent declines in minority
enrollment, respectively.
University administrators say
they are struggling to reverse the
decline in minority enrollment.
Without legal backing, the. Uni-
versity's admissions office is lim-
ited in its power to create a diverse
student body.
"We look forward to the Court's
decision," University spokeswom-
an Kelly Cunningham said in a
statement. "In the meantime, the
University continues to follow the
strictures of Proposal 2."
Washington isn't optimistic
that the University will take a
"courageous" stance.
"When (Proposal 2) passed in
2006, Mary Sue Coleman made
a defiant speech on the Diag say-
ing they were going to fight it, and
we don't know exactly what hap-
pened, but somebody told her, you

this small increase still leaves us
falling behind other states and
other nationswith less funding for
higher education than we had just
a couple years ago," Irwin said.
Despite his criticism of the
amount of higher education
funding, Irwin said he's glad the
governor has recommended the
creation of a health savings fund.
"The Affordable Care Act was
providing hundreds.of millions
of dollars to the state of Michi-
gan to expand healthcare to
needy families ... For the gover-
nor to say that he is prepared to
take that federal money and use
it to provide service to people in
Michigan, I have to say I support
that," Irwin said.
However, Irwin said the gover-
nor shouldn't get too much praise
for proposing what Irwin called a
"no-brainer."
"I think it's the right decision,
but I can't give him particularly
high marks for standing behind
this idea that is so obviously
right for Michigan that the only
people that would stand opposed
to Medicaid expansion are folks
who are so anti-government and
just so verily opposed to Presi-
dent Obama asa person that they
wouldn't be willing to put their
name alongside anything (like
this)."
know, 'shut up,"' Washington said.
"And that's kind of what they've
done ever since."
Complicating the matter is
the impending ruling in Fisher
v. University of Texas, Austin, a
Supreme Court case which could
have sweeping implications for
affirmative action policies across
the nation. Although the Supreme
Court could rule narrowly in the
case and attempt to redefine affir-
mative action criteria, it could also
use the case as an opportunity to
overturn much of the precedent
set in Grutter v. Bollinger and
Gratz v. Bollinger, in which much
of the University's race-based
admissions policies were upheld.
The Supreme Court has not
announced a decision but the
court's ruling in Fisher v. Texas
could impact whether or not they
decide to take the new case from
BAMN and the state.

At least 53 dead in ITunisia Islamists

Zambia bus crash,
22 hospitalized
A bus operated by Zambia's
postal service carrying passengers
toward its capital Lusaka smashed
into a semi-truck and another car
Thursday, killing atleast 53 people
in one of the worst traffic crashes
in the nation in recent history,
officials said.
The crash happened Thursday
morning near the town of Chi-
famba, about 100 kilometers (60
miles) north of Lusaka, police
spokeswoman Elizabeth Kanjela
said: Images carried by local
media in Zambia showed rescu-
ers climbing over the smashed-in
front-end of the white bus, the
remains of the orange semi-truck
in pieces in front of it. Other
images showed corpses laying
alongside the two-lane high-
way that connects the capital to
neighboring Tanzania.

Teenage gang rape
causes outrage in
South Africa
In a country where one in
four women is raped and where
months-old babies and 94-year-old
grandmothers are sexually assault-
ed, citizens are demanding action
after a teenager was gang-raped,
sliced open from her stomach to
her genitals, and left for dead on a
constructionsite last week.
The 17-year-old lived long
enough to identify one of her
attackers, a 22-year-old. Police
arrested him and said Thursday
they have arrested a second sus-
pect, aged 21. They promised more
arrests soon.
"Kill them!" and "Cut off
their penises," were some of the
demands voiced on talk show
radio stations Thursday.
Every few months this African
nation with the highest rate of
rapes of babies and young girls in
the world yells its outrage at a par-
ticularly brutal attack.

reject new gov't
as crisis continues

Plans to replace
.government after
politician's murder
leads to protests
TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) -
Tunisia sank deeper into polit-
ical crisis Thursday, as the
ruling Islamist party rejected
its own prime minister's deci-
sion to replace the government
after the assassination of a
leftist politician led to a wave
of angry protests.
The murder of Chokri
Belaid, a 48-year-old secular-
ist and a fierce critic of hard-
line Islamists as well as the
more moderate ruling party,
laid bare the challenges fac-
ing this nation of 10 million,
whose revolution two years
ago sparked the Arab Spring
uprisings.
Because of its small, well-
educated population, there
were hopes Tunisia would
have the easiest time tran-
sitioning from dictatorship
to democracy. But instead
Tunisia - a staunchly secular
state under ex-dictator Zine
El Abidine Ben Ali - is now a
battleground pitting secular-
ists, moderate Islamists, and
hardline Islamists against one
another.
The economy has struggled,
power-sharing negotiations
have stalled, and political
violence is on the rise. The
rejection of the prime minis-
ter's move to create a govern-
ment of technocrats to guide
the country to elections also
made clear that divisions exist
between hardliners and mod-
erates within the ruling party,
Ennahda.
Police used tear gas Thurs-
day to drive off the few dozen
protesters who tried to dem-
onstrate in front of the Interi-
or Ministry, averting a repeat

of the large rallies that swept
the capital hours after Belaid's
assassination Wednesday.
But full-scale riots hit
the southern mining city of
Gafsa, where Belaid's Popu-
lar Front coalition of leftist
parties enjoys strong support.
The state news agency TAP
also reported clashes in cit-
ies across the country, with
police resorting to tear gas
and warning shots. In the
northwest town of Boussa-
lem, demonstrators set fire to
a police station.
The tension could escalate
Friday. Dramatic turnout is
expected for Belaid's funeral;.
coupled with a general strike
called by the main labor
union, the events raise the
prospect of confrontations
nationwide.
The police and army have
been put on alert to prevent
any outbreaks of violence and
to "deal with any troublemak-
ers" announced the presi-
dential spokesman Adnan
Mancer in a news conference
late Thursday.
He added that police are
questioning a possible suspect
in the murder - a member of,
Belaid's political party who
was working as his chauffer
and was witnessed speak-
ing with one of the assailants
before the politician was shot
to death in his car outside his
home Wednesday morning.
The latest . events have
raised fears Tunisia may not
be an exception to the turmoil
in the region, where several
states are in a post-revolution-
ary phase.
U.N. Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon condemned the
assassination and called for
the reform process to go for-
ward, saying "Tunisia's demo-
cratic transition should not
be derailed by acts of politi-
cal violence," U.N. spokesman
Martin Nesirky said.

unions' efforts.
"If you're a beneficiary, you
need to contribute to the nego-
tiations and all the organizing
that goes into a collective agree-
ment," Robinson said.
Art & Design senior Ian
Matchett, a representative from
the Student Union of . Michi-
gan, said he too opposed the
law. SUM is a recently formed
organization working to control
tuition costs and increase stu-
dent input in budget appropria-
tions.
Matchett said the majority
of graduating students will be
members of the workforce rath-
er than business owners and
therefore anti-union measures

would directly affectathem.
He added that it was impor-
tant for students to take a pro-
union stance to best represent
their interest in the long run.
"Our challenge is organizing
student opinions and support-
ing the fact that students should
have. a right to share their mes-
sage," Matchett said. "We can-
not rely on the state to give us
this right."
One such reform could come
through endorsing student rep-
resentation on the University's
Board of Regents, Matchett sug-
gested.
"The idea is for the stu-
dent body as a whole to have a
voice," Matchett added. "If we
get that, we can begin to make
calls through that position and
begin organizing for a more
powerful Central Student Gov-

erment.",
State Representative Jeff
Irwin told the crowd that
he blames the "current con-
servative leadership of our
state" for imposing legisla-
tion that could drive down
wages.
"People need to understand
that the most dynamic, suc-
cessful economies in the world
respect collective bargaining,"
Irwin said. "Then they can wrap
their heads around the idea that
diminishing union rights isn't
going to make our state more
prosperous."
In an interview after the
event, Irwin said he hopes Uni-
versity students become more
active in modern political move-
ments by educating themselves
on the implications of restric-
tive legislation.

If somebody sneezes on a cake, I probably
don't want to eat it either - but if you're
blowing out candles, how many organisms
are transferred to a communal cake, for
goodness' sake?"
- Australian Medical Association President Steve Hambleton said in reponse to a ban of blowing out
candles on birthday cakes in Australia in guidelines set by Australia's National Health and Medical
Research Council, a Sydney newspaper reported.

Universities should promote forums for controversial issues
n Thursday, two supporters of Palestinian independence
spoke at Brooklyn College in New York. The event, co-
sponsored by student organizations and Brooklyn College's
department of political science, has attracted an array ofcriticism
from pro-Israel groups, Jewish students and the New York City Coun-
cil. Many have called sponsoring the event a "tacit endorsement" -
something they see as unacceptable. These criticisms and threats are
inappropriate; they threaten to stifle debate and therefore hinder the

0
S

promise of academic freedom.
The speakers represented a group that
advocates for boycotts and sanctions against
Israel. Brooklyn College has a significant Jew-
ish student population, and thus the scheduled
speakers have provoked harsh responses. On
Jan.29, the New York City Council sent a letter
to Brooklyn College's president, Karen Gould.
They demanded the event be canceled and
threatening to suspend funding to the school.
Gould replied 'with a letter in support of the
event and invited student groups to bring
groups with differing views to campus.
Brooklyn College has the right to host this
event without any threats. Many of the criti-
cisms levied against it are highly exagger-
ated. For example, Alan Maisel, the New York
state assemblyman representing Brooklyn,
called this a "potential for a second Holo-
caust." This is a gross exaggeration of the
speakers' legitimate views in an academic
debate. This incident is similar to one that
occurred in 1999, when NYC Mayor Rudy
Giuliani threatened to cut funding to muse-
ums because of a controversial exhibit at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art. New York is setting
a precedent in which politicians intervene
in public spheres of education and culture.

Bloomberg notes that government shouldn't
be "micromanaging the kinds of programs
our public universities run." The city coun-
cil has no right or responsibility to label any
academic opinion it disagrees with as wrong
and harmful.
Controversial events are common at uni-
versities. For instance, in 2003 the University
held a political forum with both an Israeli and
Palestinian advocate. In 2011 at Brooklyn Col-
lege, David Horowitz, a pro-Israel conserva-
tive, spoke, but he wasn't sponsored by any
department. Exposing students to new ideas
and perhaps challenging them with other per-
spectives. Politicians shouldn't reprehend col-
leges for promoting academic debate.
The controversy over academic freedom
at Brooklyn College is highly exaggerated.
Many of the criticisms of the speakers are
misguided, and the council's threat to revoke
funding is an inappropriate extension of gov-
ernment into higher-level academics. Schools
consistently sponsor events with controversial
speakers, and fostering academic expression
and debate is part of their job. Brooklyn Col-
lege should be supported for their dedication
to academic freedom.

Well, congratulations;
we've officially survived
the first month of winter
semester. And I
can't say I'm sur-
prised to step out !
of my house and
face the frigid,
snow-covered
streets of Ann
Arbor each
morning. It's a
gray-on-gray SARM
utopia - rare SKALUBA
sunshine, very
few blue skies
and an ice-cold chill that occasion-
ally makes you question your deci-
sion to come to school here in the
first place.
Meanwhile, half your classmates
are casually spending the semester
abroad in Barcelona, Madrid, Paris,
Prague - insert any romantic Euro-
pean city of your liking - while we
continue pushingthrough our class-
es in the great state of Michigan.
And it's a great state indeed, minus
the gloomy weather and freezing
temperatures.
But the constant Facebook albums
and statuses that bombard my news-
feed each day make things in Ann
Arbor seem a little bleak. It's no sur-
prise that we're a community that
lives online - constantly uploading
new pictures, tweeting about the
day's adventures and blowing up
our friend's walls. But at a certain
point this constant communication
becomes wearing.
We all suffer from the epidemic
at some point in our lives. It's a
syndrome that affects our genera-
tion at unprecedented levels. Espe-
cially considering how freely we
allow Facebook, Twitter and other
social media sites to consume us.

It's the "fear of missing out" - a.k.a
FOMO. We love our friends abroad,
really we do. But the 760 pictures
they jam into a single album and
the continuous stream of #nofilter
photographs uploaded to Instagram
prove exhausting. As much as I want
to "like" every photo in their album
and throw myself a pity-party while
stranded alone in Ann Arbor - I
politely refuse.
The other night I was speak-
ing with an exchange student from
Istanbul, whining about how expen-
sive it is to travel to Europe, when
she simply asked, "But why worry
about traveling across Europe when
you have yet to see all the sites here
in your own country?" And she's
absolutely right.
Living in Ann Arbor and experi-'
encing Ann Arbor are not one in the
same. A conscious effort needs to be
made if we really want to challenge
ourselves, explore the community
around us, create our own adven-
tures and immerse ourselves in the
uncomfortable.
Staying sane during the long
winter months is no easy task, I
know that. But flocking to Rick's in
record-breaking numbers and hit-
ting the South University bars like
they're the next best thing to Ibiza
may not be the answer. Nor will we
find refuge bundled up in our blan-
kets all weekend, rolling around
our apartments. While Facebook-
stalking our beloved friends abroad.
Instead, I challenge you to take a
new approach to combat these drea-
ry winter months.
Have you ventured to the Farm-
ers Market in Kerrytown yet? It's
open every Saturday morning Janu-
ary through April, which means
you can't exactly use the weather
for an excuse. What about dragging

your textbooks and homework to a
not-so-run-of-the-mill coffee shop
- maybe Crazy Wisdom Bookstore
and Tea Room or Comet Coffee?
Living in Ann Arbor
and experiencing
Ann Arbor are not
one in the same.
It's easy to fall into a funk of repe-
tition and hibernation when it seems
like so many of your friends are off
seeing the world oceans away, and
you're quite literally stuck in the
snow at Michigan. But I dare you
to do something different - to shy *
away from the repetitiveness we so
often find ourselves in.
Last weekend, I. had breakfast
at Selma Cafe - an Ann Arbor-
only, community-run cafe - for the
first time. Needless to say, I busted
straight into the kitchen and looked
like a lost puppy ina crowd of regu-
lar breakfast-goers. But did I have a
fabulous meal, meet new people and
make the executive decision that I
would have to return for round two?
Yes. And this weekend I'll be trek-
king to Mt. Brighton to snowboard
on a large mound of garbage. Sure,
it might not be the Swiss Alps, but
there's no harm in trying.
To my dearest friends abroad, I
loveyouall. Butif Ihappentounsub-
scribe from your newsfeed and
spend a drastically smaller amount
of time on Facebook this semester, I
promise it's nothing personal.

Chivalry's whip

All too often we hear from those with gray
hair that "chivalry is dead." Well, whether
or not that is fact or fiction depends on how
chivalry is defined.
If by "chivalry" they mean there are no more
gentlemen knights to defend royal princesses,
then perhaps I don't have an argument; there
just aren't any, unless you go to a park in New
Jersey on some Saturday mornings.
But, if our elders mean that there are no
more gentlemen, then I'd have to disagree.
The issue is not whether or not knights and
princesses exist in the student body. It's
whether they'd ever be brave enough to don
their shining armor while living on campus.
And that's the thing we ought to consider.
So, this is all a little abstract - let's bring
it back to reality, specifically to the memo-
ries from my time in middle and high school.
There's a funny term I've heard since Bar
Mitzvah season in seventh grade, when we all
first started talking about girls: "whipped."
I've never gotten a clear definition, but I'll
discuss my interpretation.
"Whipped" is the idea that doing nice
things for women is more of an act of despera-
tion than anything else. It's "laying all your
cards on the table," presumably because get-
ting laid just isn't in the cards for you. It's put-
ting out far too much effort because nobody
puts out for you.
Since when did "trying hard" become
"trying too hard?" When did any semblance
of "effort made" become "too much effort?"
Being a knight is incompatible in a world of
whips; rather than a horse chomping at the bit
to prove your worth to someone who's worth
it, being whipped makes you into an ass.
So let's go back to that original statement:
chivalry is dead.
I think if anything, the problem is more
systematic issue than individual. In a world
networked communicators and informa-
tion, what is there to prove? I suppose, since
the first thing we look at when we hear a
new name is their pictures, it matters more
where they've been than where they're going.
Perhaps the absence of chivalry is due to a
change in perspective; the question is not
"will he sweep me off my feet," but rather,

"has he swept people off their feet before?"
The anticipatoryexcitementinnotknowinghas
been replaced with our compulsion to evaluate
by online. "Proving himself" has become more
passive than active. The death of chivalry is
born out of the basic idea that "if he were really
like this, he'd have done it before."
Maybe in that sense, the idea of the phrase
"whipped" is not so far off. It's the belief that
you have met someone who has changed you;
they controlyou and they have somehow trans-
formed you. But is that really such a bad thing?
In the movies, when someone says "you
complete me," what does that meanPIs it to say
that they've found that single piece that beau-
tifully fits into the puzzle that was already
almost finished? Or does it indicate that what
the puzzle means to show is completely incom-
prehensible without that piece - that there's
no identity, there's no picture, without that
one little bit extra. This begs the question,
when I flirt with anyone and everyone, am I
really trying to prove "me" to them, or am I
trying to prove "us?" Because, according to the
latter jigsaw analogy, there isn't a "me" that's.
significant without that last little part.,
Perhaps chivalry has died out of our own
narcissism. In a constant world of compari-
sons, relativity and self-identification, is try-
ing to establish a relationship really about
"me," or can it be about "us?"
There's an expression we all know that
supports this sort of realization: "you'll find
your Prince Charming." There's no defini-
tive person with first name Prince, last name
Charming. It's about "us," not about "him."
The knight in shining armor doesn't exist
without the princess. But undoubtedly, Mr.
Knight was riding around for a good long
while in the stifling heat without Gatorades
or Clif Bars before he found his princess out
there in that forest - that sounds like he was
trying pretty hard to me.
So I should ask: am I "whipped" for
really taking the time and effort to see if
this girl I met is my princess? And even if I
am, am I okay humiliating "me" in front of
all of my friends for the prospect of "us?"

Lance cheated, so what?

Lance Armstrong lied to us. He
cheated, doped and silenced anyone
who tried to expose him. He also
raised millions of dollars to fight
cancer, but who cares? He deceived
us and we're hurt. We looked up to
him and he betrayed our trust. We
praised him and his great American
story - the story about fighting and
winning and competing and, most
importantly, more winning. Arm-
strong's desperate desire to win
helped him survive cancer and then
seven Tour de France titles. So good
for him, but better forthe poor souls
fighting cancer. Without those vic-
tories - which he said himself he
probably wouldn't have earned
without doping - he wouldn't have
had the celebrity-status to start his
Livestrong Foundation, which has
today raised about $470 million,
according to Livestrong's website.
But we still don't care about his
successes, because he betrayed
us. This story circles back to the
too-familiar theme of any another
American idol deceiving his or her
worshipers. RememberPresidentfBill
Clinton and Tiger Woods's affairs?
What about the baseball players who
doped? Well, it turns out Armstrong
is just another flawed human being
like the rest of them - like the rest
of us. Why do we assume athletes
and other celebrities are perfect role
models? We have no one to blame but
ourselves for our disappointment
after investing so much into heroes
like Armstrong.

But who's to say Armstrong is a
bad role model? When I make a mis-
take, I'm usuallyrushing to the drug
store for Plan B. When Armstrong
made his mistakes, cancer research
got more funding. I wish I could
make mistakes like Armstrong's.
If we get to make mistakes, show
arrogance and fall to our vices, so do
the supposed heroes. I'm not saying
it's good. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm
just sayingthat's the way it is and we
should be aware of it. Sure, we'd love
all our heroes to be infallible, omni-
scient and pure. We'd have truly
honorable role models for our kids
to look up to. But those don't exist.
Even Homer's heroes and gods
were a little screwed up. Zeus raped
people. Odysseus cheated on his
wife. Was Homer trying to con-
vince us that these actions should
be accepted, no questions asked,
because they were gods?In my opin-
ion, he wasn't. But what was true
of Greek gods and heroes is true of
modernAmericanheroes: they're all
tragic; they're all imperfect.
So if you're waiting for Super-
man, fuck off. He's not coming.
Even our great American stories
- you know, the ones where the
protagonist overcomes some great
obstacle (cancer), overcomes more
obstacles (seven Tour de Fran-
ces), uses him fame and celebrity
to raise money to fight disease,
then lives happily ever after -
these stories usually only maintain
their greatness so long as the dark

truth remains hidden. And per-
haps it would be better not know-
ing the real story and believing the
nobler one.
In the end, the guy cheated; but
so did everyone else. Sure, he raised
millions of dollars for fighting can-
cer, but he did so dishonestly and
deceptively, so fuck him, right? I
say: whatever. Fuck him or punch
him - this one dude doesn't matter
as much as we pretend he does and
we can't continue believing in per-
fedt idols like we thought he was.
We'll continue to be let down. We
also need to examine how and why
we judge people. Does our judgment
spawn from personal feelings of
betrayal, or are we truly examining
a person's actions? $470 million to
fight cancer? I'll let the cheating go,
because it's only sports (in fact, it's
only cycling). But money for cancer
research? That's life or death. I say
that end, however unintentional,
justifies doping.
Charles Barkley once said, "I'm
not a role model." I always wanted
to tell him: Chuck, you are whatever
we say you are. Hasn't he listened to
Eminem? And so, the blame is on us
- the fanatics searching for some-
one to follow and then dropping
them when they make a mistake.
So perhaps like you, I'm left ask-
ing myself: Who should I follow?
Who should I copy? And then I look
in the mirror.

"The Godfather Part IV: Oh God, We Look So Old."
Pacino, Walken
and Arkin delight

Friends and family
take centerstage in
'Stand Up Guys'
By CONRAD FOREMAN
Doity Arto Writer
Pacino. Walken. Arkin. Could

winning actors B

half of actorial AtQuality 16
awesomeness. and Rave
Val (Al Pac-
ino, "The God- Lionsgate
father"), an old
con man, gets out of prison, having
just served 28 years because of an
accidentalkillingduringabotched
job. Doc (Christopher Walken,
"Catch Me If You Can"), Val's
friend and former business part-
ner, is there to welcome Val back
to the world. However, this isn't
the joyful reunion of friends that
it should be. Their old boss orders
Doc to kill Val for allowing his son
to die on the same job that landed

Val in prison. Conflicted, but fear-
ful of the consequences should he
not carry out the job, Doc allows
Val to spend his remaining hours
in whatever way he wants (leading
them to a brothel, a new car and A
LOT of breaking and entering).
During their nighttime adven-
tures, they rescue their old friend
Hirsch (Alan Arkin, "Argo"), now
residingin anursinghome. Hirsch
is eager to escape, asking only that
his friends let him "get another*
hit" of his oxygen tank before
breaking out. Arkin is able to steal
almost every scene he's in, and he
generates many of the laughs for a
movie that is much more of a black
comedythan it's sold as.
The film has its fair share of
deep and serious moments as
well. Hirsch's relationship with
his daughter is featured, with
her reflecting on the valuable les-
sons her father taught her. Doc's
attachment to his granddaughter
becomes central to his character
and the plot. Disconnected from
his daughter, Doc has found his
granddaughter and routinely
interacts withher -unbeknownst
to his daughter. The protection of
friends and family emerges as the
major theme of the film, as most of
the decisions made by the charac-

ters are made in order to protect -
or avenge - somebody important
to them.
Pacino is perfectly suited for
this role, as the character in some
ways reflects his career in act-
ing - the glory days of gunfights
and heists are long gone, but this
washed-up hero of old isn't quite
ready to let them go. Walken is
exactly what he should (and is
expected to) be. He delivers his
lines with his signature deadpan
expression and the most imper-
sonated voice in Hollywood.
There are even a couple of Walken
"OH!" moments, which should all
be treasured and cherished.
"Stand Up Guys" is by no
means perfect. A few of the jokes
fall flat and feel recycled, and
there are some aspects to the
story that are not entirely realis-
tic. But what shortcomings this
film has are overshadowed by
impressive performances by the
three leads and enough funny
moments tokeepup withits semi-
comedic tone. The characters are
believable and the connections
between them feel genuine, as one
would expect from this cast. This
isn't the Oscar-hungry movie that
many people are expecting, but
it's entertaining and rewarding.

"I can't wait for Kanye's new album."

Swift and McGraw
team up for country hit

By GIBSON JOHNS
Online Arts Editor
And now, the country duet
you totally forgot you always
wanted! But seriously, ever
since Taylor Swift sang her
debut single "Tim McGraw" to,
well, Tim McGraw back at the
2007 ACM Awards, this duet
needed to happen.
Anyway, it's, about time we
got another epic pop-country
midtempo collaboration, is it
not? I mean, it's been a year
and a half since Brad Pais-
ley and Carrie Underwood
released "Remind Me" and
a little over two since Jason
Aldean and Kelly Clarkson's
"Don't You Want to Stay." It's
the void that we didn't know
we needed filled, y'all. And
Tim and Taylor have hit the
spot in our achy, breaky hearts
with "Highway Don't Care" off
of McGraw's new album Two
Lanes ofFreedom.
The odds of this duet ever
happening, though, seemed to
dissipate in recent years with
McGraw focusing on his acting
career with supporting roles in
"The Blind Side" and "Country
Strong,"

The game also incorporates
an oft-frustrating, somewhat
clunky platforming component
that relies on pulling, grappling
and leaping with Dante's various
abilities. An unfriendly camera
makes the occasional jump take
15 more tries than necessary,
and the breaks from the action
fail to add much to the game,
sometimes making it feel like the
platforming aspect was forced
or added as an afterthought.
Exploration leads to rewards,
however, and to get the highest
scores players should aim to find

Eclectic rock
band to visit the
Michigan
By MAX RADWIN
Daily Fine Arts Editor
Yo La Tengo returns to Ann
Arbor Friday for a one-night
performance at The Michigan
Theatre before
continuing its Yo La Tengo
tour in Toron-
to. The Ark is Friday at
putting on the 8$p.m.
show.
The band Michigan Theatre
is looking for- From $22
ward to playing
in the 87-year-
old theater, which it has done
once before.
"It's a lot different of an
experience than other venues
in town," said bassist James
McNew. "(It's) really beautiful. I
think I also went to the movies
there on my night off."
The band is touring to pro-
mote their 13th album, Fade,
which dropped Jan. 14.
"We focused on making
a shorter record this time,"
McNew said. "Most of the songs
are a little more economical. All
of our albums have been double

albums for the last 10 years or so,
and this is the first single album
we've made in a very long time."
With the new album comes
the band's first attempt at a
music video in nearly 15 years.
Phil Morrison directed the
video to "I'll Be Around" (which,
in addition to featuring Superc-
hunk's Mac McCaughan, shows
the band preparing some sort
of tortilla dish, with the recipe
appearing on the screen for
those who might want to join
in). The band also made a video
for "Before We Run," a song that
also appears on "Fade."
But fans attending Friday's
performance don't have to worry
about it being Fade-dominated
or about missing any of their
favorite songs that the band has
produced in their almost 30-year
history.
"We've been mostly playing
a lot of songs off of Fade (while
on tour). But we're playing two
sets. The first set will be mostly
quiet material, and the second
set is louder. We'll mix it up.
The set changes every night and
there are lots of old songs."
Yo La Tengo has always been
known to "mix it up," take
chances and do the unorthodox.
The band is famous for its cover
songs - including everything
from The Ramones to Todd

Rundgren to Devo - several of
which were played impromptu
and by request on WFMU, a
radio' station headquartered
near their hometown of Hobo-
ken, New Jersey. Many of their
covers were released in a 2006
compilation album titled "Yo La
Tengo is Murdering the Clas-
sics."
The band's tendency to
cover just about anything, to
keep its sound evolving and to
stay outside of the mold of any
given genre has made it hard to
define. The one genre that con-
tinues to resurface, despite the
band's mainstream success, is
"indie." But McNew finds the
term more problematic than
helpful.
"I always felt we were rock
music. I still don't know what
indie means. I guess it meant
something back when major
labels existed, but that was a
very long time ago."
Since 1984, critics have put
Yo La Tengo under the label of
experimental, rock 'n' roll, alter-
native, electronic and every-
thing in between.
"I never really paid attention
to it," McNew said. "But I just
don't care. We don't really care
about being in a category and,
for some reason, we've never
really been in one."

case, you're M
that badass, vayiOj
and "people" Capcom
refers to the
bloodthirsty
hordes of hellspawn who want
your head on a stake.
Set in a different universe
than the four previous games,
"DmC" takes place in a contem-
porary dystopia ruled by a giant
scum-sucking demon, Mundis,
who runs just about everything
via a propaganda-ridden news
network and a brainwashing,
demonic-bile-spiked energy
drink. Players control a brand
new Dante - dark hair and
Jersey accent, compliments
of the house - on a mission to
jump, shoot and smash his way
through the city and dethrone
Mundis.
Dante gets dragged in and out

of Limbo by Mundis's forces,
exploring a parallel and ter-
rifying dimension ridden with
pissed-off flying demon robot
babies and overgrown with a
nondescript black goop. Think
Detroit following a tanker spill
and joined by a few hundred
monsters that would make Love-
craft proud.
The game doesn't reinvent the
wheel, but it makes for a pretty
sweet ride. "DmC" puts a wealth
of weapons in the player's
hands, with most having either a
demonic or angelic tint. Carving
up a chainsaw-wielding Skele-
tor wannabe with a holy scythe
is every bit as viable an option as
using a pair of pistols or a comi-
cally large heliborn axe to cave
in its face.
The gameplay should feel
familiar to "Devil May Cry"
veterans: challenging (espe-
cially on the harder difficulties),
frantic, hack-and-slash insan-
ity against wave after wave
of nightmare-inducing living
embodiments of hate. A combo
meter rewards stylish combat,
allowing competitive players to
compete online for high scores
and adding another dimension

Aesthetically, "DmC" doesn't
leave much to be desired. It's
stylish, flashy and graphically
impressive. Mundis's post-
meth-looking concubine enjoys
a wealth of unsightly scars cour-
tesy of the gorgeous textures.
Apart from Dante's brother
Vergil's distinct resemblance to
another of Capcom's enigmatic
characters, Wesker from the
"Resident Evil" series, the cast
of faces is believable, refreshing
and stunningly crafted. Dante
and Vergil's assistant amateur
graffiti artist/witch Kat's char-
acter model is meticulously
detailed from her caked-on eye-
liner to, borderline-overdone
cleavage.
The game's story unravels
beautifully. While the plot is
pretty straightforward and the
writing. is deliciously cheesy,
great pacing and voice acting
creates palpable tension as the
world begins to crumble.
While "DmC" isn't anything
new, it offers a solid and genu-
inely fun experience, some chal-
lenging gameplay and a new
storyline for series veterans and
newcomers alike.

rious at the Kohl
Center, where Wisconsin has won
five of its last six meetings against
top-five teams.
In the teams' only contest last
year, the Wolverines bested the
Badgers, 59-41, in Ann Arbor to
snap a nine-game losing skid to
Wisconsin. Junior guard Tim
Hardaway Jr., fresh off one of
his best games this season in a
win over Ohio State on Tuesday,
carried Michigan in last year's
matchup, scoring a game-high
17 points and pulling down 10
rebounds for one of his two dou-
ble-doubles last year.
A key to last season's win was
the Wolverines' ability to out-
rebound the Badgers, largely
due to the effort of then-redshirt
sophomore forward Jordan Mor-
gan. Morgan had 11 rebounds
- five of which came on the offen-
sive end - as Michigan won the
battle of the boards, 38-29, and
scored 13 second-chance points.

Sophomore guard Trey Burke will have a big role in the transition game against the Badgers, who like to slow the game down.

year we're going to want her to
up her strikeout ratio, to develop
pitches. Our goal is to develop
another pitch. She has a job to do
to help us win."
Freshman Sierra Romero
is slotted to start at shortstop
in place of senior Amy Knapp.
Knapp, who will make her career
debut at third base,has embraced
the transition.
"I think at third base you
really just control the field and
it's really easy to bethe voice out
there," Knapp said. "That's my
main role on the field right now,
is to let everybody know where
the play is. I really enjoy it."
At least for the time being, the
starting job at first base is up for
grabs.
Hutchins mentioned four
players with the potential to fill
the void, including freshman
Kelsey Susalla.
"First (base) is the wide-open
position," Hutchins said. "We're
looking to see who steps up in
gameplay. We'll make decisions
based on what we need and who
we're up against. I think compe-
tition's good. They've been push-
ing each other."
The Wolverines will face their
toughest opponent in No. 10
South Florida on Saturday. The
Bulls will be led by a Player of
the Year candidate of their own
in ace left-hander Sara Nevins.
Both Hutchins and the cap-
tains are confident going up
against one of the nation's best.
"It doesn't matter how good
we are right now, it only matters
how good we become," Hutchins
said. "We're going to take every
lesson from this weekend, the
good and the bad, and we're
going to bea little bit better. And
that's all we're looking to do."

But Morgan has played just six
combined minutes in the Wol-
verines' last two contests after
spraining his ankle two minutes
into the Jan. 27 game at Illi-
nois. His status for Saturday is
unknown.
"Hopefully he'll be ready to go
this weekend," Beilein said after
Tuesday's win. "We need him
back."
Redshirt sophomore forward
Jon Horford has filled Morgan's
void in the starting lineup, but
freshman forward Mitch McGary
has received the brunt of Mor-
gan's minutes.
McGary played 29 minutes in
the win over the Buckeyes, scor-
ing 14 points and collecting six
rebounds and four steals. But
Ohio State and Indiana both out-
scored Michigan (8-2 Big Ten,
21-2 overall) in the paint and
registered a combined 30 sec-
ond-chance points, exploiting a
Wolverine defense that suffered

from more defensive breakdowns
than normal.
"(Morgan) would've helped
us a little bit, because the angles
that Jon and Mitch are playing
are much like the angles Jordan
used to play with way back when,"
Beilein said after Tuesday's over-
time win.
Burke had a relatively quiet
game against Wisconsin (7-3,
16-7) last year, recording just two
assists, but was defended by all-
everything guard Jordan Taylor,
who graduated last season. Tay-
lor's would-be replacement, Josh
Gasser, tore his ACL just days
before the season began and is out
for the year.
The Badgers struggled in the
season's onset, dropping games
to mediocre Virginia and Mar-
quette teams, but have settled
into more of a groove in confer-
ence play under veteran coach Bo
Ryan. Wisconsin upset Indiana in
Assembly Hall three weeks ago.

The game will likely be decid-
ed on Michigan's offensive end,
especially if the Wolverines can
operate in transition, something
they struggled to do against Ohio
State. The Badgers, known for
taking opponents out of their
rhythm by forcing them to play at
a slow tempo, currently rank 11th
in scoring defense nationally (56.2
points per game). Michigan ranks
sixth nationally with a 41.2-per-
cent 3-point shooting mark, but
Wisconsin holds opponents to just
30.6-percent shooting from deep.
"The key to beating the Bad-
gers is just being solid," said
senior guard Josh Bartelstein in
his weekly blog on www.mgoblue.
com. "We cannot beat ourselves
taking bad shots or going for
steals. They are known for hold-
ing the ball for all 35 seconds and
making you guard them for the
entire shot clock. If you take a sec-
ond off or don't box out, you are
going to get burned."

"I don't think he's at the top

Rutledge can expect to see a

Lee leads the Fighting Irish with

Notre Dame will also look to
its defense, which ranks seventh

Michigan edges
gritty Illinois

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
The maize, blue (and pink)
fought hard on Thursday night for
both a cause and the season.
In its second "pink-out" game
in four days, the Michigan wom-
en's basketball team learned from
its first one, a 61-46 loss to Michi-
gan State ILINOIS 69
on Monday, MICHIGAN 72
and edged
out Illinois,
72-69, in front of a crowd dressed
to support breast cancer aware-
ness.
On Thursday night, the Wol-
verines knocked off the Fighting
Illini (6-4 Big Ten, 13-9 overall)
in a tight battle that ended Michi-
gan's three-game losing streak.
In an offensive game where nei-
ther team had a lead greater than
seven, the defense took a backseat
to hotshooting on both sides.
Sheffer was the only Wolverine
to score in the first 8:07 of play, but
her nine points during that span
kept Michigan (6-4, 17-6) within
striking distance.
Once the rest of the Wolver-
ines got going, almost everyone
found their shot, and six of the
eight players that saw playing
time in the first half scored. Led
by Sheffer - who scored 15 of her
21 points in the first half - Michi-
gan was able to pull away and end
its losing streak. The center also
added seven rebounds and four
steals.
Meanwhile, the Fighting Illini
found offense in all forms in the
early goings of the game. Dur-
ing that same 8:07 span, four of
the five Illinois starters scored.
The Fighting Illini are second in
scoring in Big Ten play, but were
unable to close the game out at the
end.
After going into halftime with
just a four-point lead, the Wolver-
ines hadtwo early turnovers in
the second half that allowed the
Fighting Illini to tie the game at
40.
Illinois found itself in deep foul
trouble soon after, and was forced
to sit senior forward Karisma
Penn, who led the team with 12
points in the first half.
"(Fouls) were the difference in
the game," said Michigan coach
Kim Barnes Arico. "Karisma Penn
was hurtingus in the first half and
we weren't able to stop her on the
block, so her picking up her third
foul in the first half and then get-
ting into (more) foul trouble in the
second half was a reallybigkeyfor
us.
"Without her, (senior forward)
Nya (Jordan) was really able to
push to the basket. That really
helped us."
Michigan took advantage by
stretching its lead to six, and after
a scoring drought for both teams
that lasted almost four minutes,
senior guard Jenny Ryan broke
the silence by splitting the Illinois
defense for a layup.
From there, it appeared the
Wolverines were going to run
away with the game, but the
Fighting Illini fought back with
3:49 remaining and grabbed their
first lead since 6:21 left in the first
half. After a quick timeout, senior
forward Kate Thompson picked a
great time to shoot out of her five-
game slump, hitting back-to-back

3-pointers that gave Michigan the
lead for good. Thompson's five
3-pointers brought her season
total to 85, which is tied for the
school record.
Despite Illinois getting within
one with 1:20 remaining, the Wol-
verines were able to convert at the
line, finishing 17-for-21. A quick
basket from Jordan with 24.4 sec-
onds left sealed the win.
"Closing the game out, Jenny's
free throws were huge for us," said
Thompson. "They were really key
for us to win the game."
The Wolverines shot 51.1 per-
cent from the field, including
shooting 46.4 percent in the first
half, but allowed Illinois to stay in
the game in the first half with its
51.7-percent shooting. However,
Michigan did a better job in the
second half and limited the Fight-
ing Illini to 39.7-percent shooting
on the night.
In addition to Sheffer's huge
offensive night, the Wolverines
found help from Jordan, who
ended the night with 13 points,

and nine rebounds. Thompsonhad "I know we had a ton of turn-
15 points, but went 5-for-15 from overs, but I thought we did a

Cancer survivors inspire Blue

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
After losing in East Lansing in
front of a raucous crowd of 8,812
on Monday in Michigan State's,
pink night, the Michigan wom-
en's basketball team held its own
"Pink Game" on Thursday. With
breast-cancer survivors on hand,
the Wolverines looked to recover
from their season-high three-
game losing streak and begin a
fresh start for the rest of the sea-
son against Illinois (6-4 Big Ten,
13-9 overall)..
And with the inspiring mes-
sages and stories from a group
of women in attendance, that's
exactly what Michigan (6-4,17-6)
did, beating the Fighting Illini,
72-69.
The Wolverines wore maize
jerseys with pink trimming to
go along with pink shoes, and a
different breast-cancer survivor
introduced each starter before
she took the floor.
But that wasn't the first inter-
action the players had with this
strong group of cancer survivors.
"A couple weeks ago, we had
those women that announced the

dinner with us," said Michigan
coach Kim Barnes Arico. "They
spoke to our team about their
stories: how long they've been
