Eli Savit, the Democratic 
candidate 
for 
Washtenaw 
County Prosecutor, met with 
students at the Ford School of 
Public Policy Sunday afternoon 
to 
discuss 
his 
campaign 
and ways students can get 
involved. Policy for the People, 
an organization focused on 
supporting activists and their 
progressive agendas, hosted the 
event. 
After working as a law clerk 
for Supreme Court Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg in Washington, 
D.C., Savit returned to Michigan 
to work as a legal counsel for the 
City of Detroit. Savit announced 
his campaign back in May 2019, 
when it was believed incumbent 
Brian Mackie would be running 
for re-election. 
Savit spent the majority of his 
time talking about combating 
mass incarceration. According 
to Savit, change begins with 
local prosecutors’ offices. 

“We talk about the land of 
the free, and as the land of the 
free, we are the world leader in 
incarceration,” Savit. “And a lot 
of that is driven by the decisions 
that are made by local district 
attorneys and local prosecutors 
because for decades in this 
country, all local prosecutors 
have done is brought on a tough 
on crime platform.” 
In order to combat mass 
incarceration, 
Savit 
outlined 
a 
16-point 
plan 
for 
the 
prosecutor’s office. On Sunday, 
he focused on three of those 
points. 
“What I’m committed to doing 
as prosecutor is treating drug 
addiction as the health issue 
that it is, not charging people 
simply because they have a health 
problem,” Savit said. “If you had 
a broken leg, we wouldn’t say ‘go 
to jail.’ But addiction is a health 
issue just like a broken leg and 
sending people to jail or prison 
doesn’t fix it.”

CITY

Students claim climate coalition did not listen to their input on initiatives

In a new report conducted 
by WalletHub, Ann Arbor was 
voted the best college town for 
cities with a population under 
125,000 people, and the 5th 
overall best college town in the 
United States.
 The report rated 415 cities 
based on three factors. The first 
factor, 
Wallet 
Friendliness, 
evaluated the cost of housing, 
cost of living, fitness club fees, 
the price of pizza, burgers, a 
movie and bowling, as well as 
the cost of higher education 
and the student debt per 
person. 
The study also used Social 
Environment, 
which, 
along 
with a variety of other factors, 
took 
into 
account 
gender 
balance, 
nightlife 
options, 
cafes per capita and students 
per capita.
The 
final 
factor 
was 
Academic 
and 
Economic 

Opportunities, 
which 

evaluated the quality of higher 
education, earning potential 
for 
college 
graduates, 
the 
amount 
of 
recent 
college 
graduates moving into the city 
and the median income for 
part-time workers.

The University of Michigan 
program “Transforming Research 
into Action to Improve the Lives of 
Students” finalized its partnership 
with 
Detroit 
Public 
Schools 
Community District last week to 
expand access to mental health 
care in schools, after successful 
implementation 
in 
Washtenaw 
County.
TRAILS launched in 2013 when 
local Ann Arbor area high school 
community members expressed 
an overwhelming need for mental 
health support for students. The 
program began its partnership 
with the Ann Arbor Public School 
district in 2013, and has since 
expanded to 40 Washtenaw County 
schools. 
TRAILS trains school staff on 
their practices and cultivates an 
ongoing partnership for over a year 
to provide implementation support. 
Andrew 
Nalepa, 
a 
school 
psychologist 
at 
Skyline 
High 
School, said he has seen the direct 
benefits from the TRAILS program 
in Ann Arbor.
“The coaching model and having 
someone with us to help support us 
getting the program off the ground 
was vital to the long-term success,” 
Nalepa said.

Following 
a 
City 
Council 
resolution for Ann Arbor to 
achieve carbon neutrality by 
2030, members of city staff and 
the public are working together 
to reach that goal. In support of 
this work, the Ann Arbor Office 
of Sustainability and Innovations 
launched A2Zero in November 
2019, a new initiative aimed at 
planning 
and 
implementing 

actions to achieve a just and 
equitable transition to complete 
carbon neutrality.
A2Zero aims to address four 
sectors, including energy, mobility, 
resource reduction and adaptation 
and resilience. The initiative plans 
to encourage the transition to 
renewable energy, design a zero-
carbon transportation network 
and minimize waste, among other 
actions.
The goal to achieve carbon 
neutrality was passed on Nov. 

13 of last year at the city’s 
Carbon Neutrality Town Hall. 
Missy Stults, sustainability and 
innovations manager for the city, 
spoke to The Daily about A2Zero’s 
goals for the first pilot year and 
the next decade. 
“A2zero was launched as a way 
to get input, to start the planning 
process, to actually create a 
plan, and then much more than 
that, to be able to sustain,” Stults 
said. “We have the branding … 
People can see it, feel it, they can 

contribute to it in all aspects of 
their life.”
In collaboration with more 
than 50 partners, A2Zero plans 
to host dozens of public events, 
run online public engagement and 
work with four technical advisory 
committees. The initiative also 
intends 
to 
continue 
creating 
new partnerships in order to 
move toward achieving carbon 
neutrality.

DANYEL THARAKAN/Daily
The Life Sciences Orchestra, the symphonic orchestra for members of the life sciences community at the University, performs at Hill Sunday afternoon.

See CARBON PAGE 2A

On Sunday afternoon, the Life 
Sciences Orchestra, sponsored by 
Gifts of Art at Michigan Medicine, 
held their free winter concert 
in front of a large audience of 
students and members of the 
public at Hill Auditorium.
Tal Benatar, the Gilbert S. 
Omenn Music Director of the Life 
Sciences Orchestra and operating 
Assistant Music Director of the 
Michigan Pops Orchestra, gave a 
lecture prior to the concert. 
In his remarks, Benatar focused 
on Jean Sibelius, one of the three 
composers 
showcased 
in 
the 

concert. On several occasions, 
Benatar quoted Sibelius, stating, 
“I admire the symphony’s severity 
of style in the profound logic 
that creates an interconnection 
between all motifs … it is like the 
world with no people.” 
Just before it was performed, 
Benatar remarked on the emotions 
evoked by the symphony.
“The symphony ends in a very 
tragic way but is also extremely 
powerful,” Benatar said. “Let the 
music make you feel ways you 
might not think of feeling.”
At the start of the concert, Dr. 
Gilbert S. Omenn, former U-M 
Executive 
Vice 
President 
for 
Medical Affairs, remarked on 

the history of the Life Sciences 
Orchestra. Omenn has been a 
part of the organization since its 
inception, 20 years ago. 
“I’m very pleased you could 
join us in the anniversary season 
for a celebration of science, music 
and medicine,” he said. “We are 
not only celebrating the 20th 
anniversary of LSO, but also the 
150th anniversary of Michigan 
Medicine.”
Each of the performers come 
from a branch of study within 
the Life Sciences field, and range 
from 
undergraduate 
students 
studying neuroscience, to retired 
physicians from the Department 
of Pediatrics and professors at the 

University of Michigan Medical 
School. 
When asked about his feelings 
about the concert, medical student 
Curtis Kuo, who is also the first 
cello, expressed excitement and 
confidence about the performance.
“I am feeling good about it,” Kuo 
said. “Tal was talking about this 
energy that we all get when we’re in 
front of an audience … there’s a lot 
more (people) than I was expecting 
but it’s great to see everyone.”
According to Kuo, the orchestra 
has been practicing for two and a 
half hours a week since September.

“The entire process has been 
designed to be iterative, failure-
positive, 
because 
we’re 
not 
going to get this right. No one 
has figured out exactly how to 
do this,” Stults said. “There isn’t 
a handbook. We’re just going 
to learn. And we’re going to do 
things better the next round. We 
just have to. Technologies will 
change, people’s sentiment will 
change, so we have to be iterative.”
The A2Zero planning process 
relies 
on 
input 
from 
Ann 
Arbor community members by 
encouraging people to fill out 
surveys or host events, according 
to Stults. She explained the first 
survey’s goal was to understand 
community priorities and specific 
actions 
community 
members 
wished to see. 

“I want to point out that we 
really are being authentic and true 
to that public engagement process 
we are in right now,” Stults said. 
“That said, I suspect there are 
certain things that will have to be 
part of that strategy, but there are 
many things that the public will 
tell us what they want to see in 
that strategy.”
The 
second 
survey, 
which 
opened 
on 
Jan. 
7, 
explores 
community 
priorities 
and 
perceptions 
of 
climate 
risks. 
The final survey will allow 
community members to provide 
explicit feedback on what should 
be included in the final carbon 
neutrality 
plan, 
according 
to 
A2Zero’s website. 
Rackham 
student 
Matt 
Sehrsweeney, a member of the 
Climate Action Movement who 
is studying environment and 
sustainability, commended Ann 
Arbor for setting a 2030 target 
for carbon neutrality, urging the 

University of Michigan to follow 
suit. 
“It’s a really exciting and 
ambitious 
plan,” 
Sehrsweeney 
said. “CAM, as an organization, 
really likes that they have set a 
target date for carbon neutrality in 
2030, which is something that our 
own University has not done. And 
that’s one of the big problems we 
see in the planning process here 
at U of M. So that’s really cool to 
see that the town is really ready to 
pull its weight and is very serious 
about taking steps that we need 
to take to respond to the climate 
crisis.”
Sehrsweeney emphasized the 
importance of the University 
contributing to efforts made by 
the city. 
“Something 
that 
we 
think 
is really important is that we 
hope that this can influence 
U-M’s 
efforts,” 
Sehrsweeney 
said. “That’s going to be really 
critical, especially because U of 

M accounts for 32 percent of the 
town’s emissions. So, necessarily, 
for the town to get to net zero 
carbon emissions, U of M is going 
to do some heavy lifting as well.” 
LSA senior Kristen Hayden, 
member of CAM and intern for the 
Ann Arbor Office of Sustainability 
and Innovations, said students as 
a demographic in Ann Arbor are 
heavily involved in the carbon 
emissions to the city, making the 
important for this initiative.
“This 2030 date is super 
ambitious, and it’s really exciting 
and a great opportunity to see 
what we’re made of,” Hayden said. 
“And if the University claimed 
this date as well, there could be a 
lot of push between the immense 
knowledge that’s built at this 
University — all the researchers 
and students who are super 
passionate — and getting solutions 
that help both the University and 
the city reach an equitable and 
sustainable future.”

Savit’s second point is to 
address racial inequity in 
Washtenaw County. People 
of color are more likely to 
be held on cash bail than are 
white people, Savit said. Savit 
also spoke about his disdain 
for cash bail, a system where 
someone awaiting a trial is 
placed in a holding cell unless 
a sum of cash is paid. 
“I’m 
committed 
to 
not 
seeking 
cash 
bail,” 
Savit 
said. “If you pose a danger 
to society, there’s no way to 
make sure you won’t threaten 
society, we are going to hold 
you. But the same standards 
are going to be applied to 
everyone, 
wealthy 
or 
not 
wealthy. And if you don’t pose 
a threat … you’re not going to 
be held.” 
Savit said his plan would 
work 
with 
organizations 
involved 
with 
criminal 
justice reform. 
“We are going to partner 
with a third-party research 
institution 
or 
a 
criminal 
justice reform organization, 
we’re going to turn over all 
of our files and we are going 
to ask, ‘Where, from arrests 
to charging to sentencing 
to 
the 
plea 
offers 
that 

people are getting, where 
are we seeing Black people 
and people of color being 
treated differently?’” Savit 
said. “As soon as we do that, 
we’re going to take action to 
eliminate them.” 
His 
final 
point 
was 
transparency. Savit said this 
point is integral to holding 
local officials accountable.
“We have no idea how 
the 
prosecutor’s 
office 
is 
spending their money, we 
have no idea if they’re getting 
results, we have no idea if 
they’re 
promoting 
equity, 
and we have no idea if they’re 
getting people the treatment 
they need,” Savit said. 
As prosecutor, Savit said he 
will make information about 
his 
office’s 
expenditures 
available online to the public. 
Savit spent his remaining 
time telling students how 
they can help out. Savit 
said his campaign is “youth 
driven” and depends on young 
voters. Since the election is in 
August, Savit told students 
they needed to take action 
now. 
“We can’t rely on a huge 
student turnout unless we 
organize now,” Savit said. 
“Part of that is going to be 
getting 
the 
message 
out 
there, getting folks at the 
University to commit to vote 
absentee. You can register 

now and the same day, vote 
absentee for any reason, and 
get those votes in that could 
really swing the election.”
Savit wrapped up the event 
by expressing his hope for 
the prosecutor’s office to 
utilize expungement more. 
Expungement is the process 
by which a criminal record 
is erased or sealed from the 
public if an individual has not 
committed another offense. 
Savit said this would help 
rebuild trust between the 
community and the county 
government. 
Policy 
for 
the 
People 
members Alyshia Dyer and 
Mike Hegeman spoke with 
The Daily after the event 
about their organization. 
“It’s 
a 
relatively 
new 
student organization,” Dyer 
said. 
“Criminal 
justice 
reform was something that 
we wanted to focus on as well 
as local activism and helping 
out the community.” 
Dyer grew up in Ypsilanti 
and was a police officer 
for seven years. She plans 
on doing more police and 
criminal justice reform work 
in the future, hence why she 
supports Savit for prosecutor. 
“It was really interesting to 
me because I’ve worked with 
a lot of prosecutors in my 
law enforcement career and 
he was a more progressive 

candidate that we don’t really 
see 
much 
in 
Washtenaw 
County,” Dyer said. “Part of it 
that motivated me to get some 
of our students involved is 
just the progressive platform 
and the fact that he is really 
interested in criminal justice 
reform and ending cash bail.” 
Hegeman 
said 
the 
organization is starting to 
take a more active role in 
promoting progressive ideals. 
“We’re 
really 
interested 
in equity,” Hegeman said. 
“We’re trying to do more 
action, 
such 
as 
(helping 
with) the Savit campaign 
and gearing up for the GEO 
negotiations coming up and 
finding more ways to get 
involved in the community.”
LSA 
freshman 
Grace 
Stephan said she sees racial 
inequity 
as 
one 
of 
the 
“grossest injustices” faced by 
the community.
“I sort of got into it because 
issues regarding people who 
were wrongfully incarcerated 
is something that really came 
to my attention a couple of 
years ago,” Stephan said. “It’s 
one of the grossest injustices 
I think exists. I really wanted 
to get involved in something 
that would be actually helpful 
towards that and towards 
criminal justice reform.”

“No hats allowed in class!” 
“Why? She’s got one on.” 
The 
whole 
class 
laughs. 
Hearing this remark in a Chicago 
Public School classroom is not 
uncommon let alone malicious. 
No matter where you came from 
or what you wore, thick skin in 
the classroom meant laughing 
along and moving on. But when 
I asked myself why I wanted 
to write for a publication that 
is made for people of color, this 
instance of a white boy making a 
“harmless” joke towards the only 
hijabi girl in my 7thgrade English 
class came to mind. Even the 
teacher laughed. Instances like 
this are buried, they are lumped 
under the large pile of subtle 
Islamophobia that is deemed 

harmless by Muslim youths, as 
if our job is to make excuses for 
other people’s behavior silently in 
our minds. When I think of this 
silence, the one that prompted 
me to ignore this comment and 
move on all those years ago, all the 
other instances of silence in my 
life come up — for example, when 
someone blatantly interrupted 
me or assumed comments about 
Arabs and Muslims would be okay 
to say in front of me because of 
my “free-spirit” and “open mind.” 
Remembering these moments is 
what prompted me to join MiC. 
I would like to bring forward the 
expression of truth in a way that 
shatters and unburies instances 
people of color have been taught 
to ignore. I would like MiC to be a 
space for me to explore the range 
and complexity of a mind told not 
to limit itself after years of being 
told to stay quiet.

As I walk through corners of 
Nathan Road where I had the 
fondest memories of teenage 
years, I see water cannons and 
riot police with their rifles and I 
start coughing from the teargas 
as I try to find the nearest train 
station on New Year’s Eve. 
Walking by the human chain 
protest with thousands of people 
that 
formed 
and 
dispersed 
within 30 minutes, some of us 
came by to chant after shopping 
on the other block, some of us 
joined the human chain after 
having dinner in the area. None 
of us expected to see the smoke 
of teargas instead of fireworks 
for New Year celebrations and 
festivities tonight, yet there we 
are. We aren’t panicked at this 
point, but we aren’t used to it, we 
cannot be comfortable with it. It 
is the 218th day of resistance and 

counting. Welcome to the police 
state of Hong Kong, where we 
have 30000 police as puppets of 
the PRC to keep a city with one 
of the lowest crime rates and 
highest education levels silent. 
“Empty 
your 
mind, 
be 
formless, shapeless — like water. 
Now you put water in a cup, it 
becomes the cup; You put water 
into a bottle it becomes the 
bottle; You put it in a teapot it 
becomes the teapot. Now water 
can flow or it can crash. Be 
water, my friend.” — Bruce Lee
“Be 
Water” 
has 
become 
a phrase that embodies the 
tactics of Hong Kong Protest. 
Our resistance is like water, 
decentralized, fluid and flexible. 
For the past 7 months, we have 
lived through the 1 million 
people rally, 2 million people 
rally, 721 triad-police colluded 
terrorism, 831 police terrorism 
in 
Prince 
Edward 
station, 
Tienanmen Massacre recurred 
in PolyU and CUHK. These 

events are not only traumas 
that are deeply engraved into 
the veins of Hong Kong people, 
but also a constant reminder 
of how we evolve ourselves as 
individuals and as a destined 
community to “be fluid and flow 
like water” amidst the leaderless 
revolution. 
Aside from having rallies 
and sit-ins every Sunday, our 
resistance has become a daily 
lifestyle. It’s not hard to find 
graffiti and flyers about the 
movement around the streets 
of Hong Kong or to receive 
informational flyers via Airdrop 
on the bus. Pro-China and pro-

Day and Night of Resistance

My early life was split between 
the 
United 
Arab 
Emirates, 
Pakistan, Canada and eventually 
the US. Growing up in these 
nations with such starkly distinct, 
often 
opposing, 
traditions, 
languages, religious beliefs and 
cultural practices has shaped 
my worldview significantly. It 
fostered a need in me to find ways 
of belonging in communities 
that, due to ignorance or fear, 
initially sought to other me. 
This developed into a need to 
bridge individuals of varying 
backgrounds. 
The constant moving and 
adjusting to new communities 
forced me to find solace in 
isolation. Through my imaginary 
friends, I discovered the powerful 
world 
of 
storytelling 
and 
theatre. Eventually, I made real 
friends through them. I believe 
storytelling is the only way 
through which we can foster deep 
empathy for people who look or 

seem different from ourselves. 
Through storytelling, we realize 
there is strength and learning 
to be found in our differences 
because we’re not so different at 
our core. 
Michigan in Color is an 
incredible space for people of 
color on a predominantly white 
campus to feel safe sharing their 
beliefs, struggles, stories and 
art. I joined MiC in the hopes of 
using the skill set I’ve cultivated 
in directing theatre to contribute 
to an environment that uplifts our 
community and draws attention 
to our shared humanity. MiC has 
a platform and an audience for the 
stories of communities of color, 
and I hope to use my experiences 
to help build bridges between 
different communities of color. 
The work MiC does to use art to 
cross those bridges is incredibly 
important to building solidarity 
between different communities 
on campus. In effect, I want to use 
MiC to build on what I’ve spent 
my whole life doing: creating a 
place for PoC in a community that 
may not realize we belong here.

I did not understand what it 
means to be Black in America 
until I arrived at the University 
of Michigan. I will never forget 
attending 
Campus 
Day 
and 
watching droves of white people 
walking to the stadium for a 
football game. I was terrified, not 
because I did not see any Black 
people, but because I could only 
see a handful of POC. My mom 
saw my fear and merely laughed 
because I was the one who chose 
to leave the Nigerian hub, which 
is Texas, for somewhere “too far 
away.”
As the first American-born 
child in my Nigerian family, the 
“American” 
in 
Nigerian-American 
was often muted because of the 
depth of community we have 
in Texas. On the weekends, I 
would accompany my mom to 
Southwest Farmer’s Market, a 
Nigerian-run foodcenter for all 
things Nigerian. Most days, I 
would attend my African church 
which was over ninety percent 
Yoruba (the best tribe in Nigeria). 
If I attended a birthday party, 
wedding, graduation, there was 
a nearly hundred percent chance 

that the person was Nigerian. 
When I would hear the term 
“Black people,” it was referring 
to what seemed like an entirely 
separate 
ethnicity. 
It 
meant 
descendant of slaves, and as a 
Nigerian-American I did not 
identify as such. 
And then I stepped on campus 
and longed for nothing more 
than to see someone with my 
complexion. I quickly integrated 
myself 
within 
the 
Black 
community here and found a 
family which has supported me 
through my most difficult times. 
I grew to understand that “Black” 
was a race, and more specifically 
that race was a social construct 
meant to oppress people who 
looked like me. I realized that I 
am Black and I am still grappling 
with what that means for me 
and my Nigerian background. 
MiC has served as the perfect 
place for me to write through the 
complexities and challenges of 
my identity. I am supported by 
other POC trying to figure out 
what their identity means to them 
in a country which is constantly 
trying to mute their culture. 
Through our writing and art, 
however, the depths and richness 
of our diverse cultures will be 
acknowledged.

Lennon Wall at Quarry Bay bus terminal with flyers and messages of resistance under the bridge. In the middle, 
candles were set up on the floor to mourn the deaths of those who died by suicide or died during the movement. 

The Terrific Torment of Two

Exhale
As my breath flowed out of my 
lungs, I could tell it was lighter than 
the humid air that enveloped me 
The effect? 
A surreal feeling-as I was floating 
a few inches above the ground
I look down and watched my toes 
dig into the earth beneath me
The sand easily gave way as my 
feet sunk in further, providing no 
explanation for the lightness I felt 
from under my collarbones 
But my ignorance was bliss 

I raised my face and smiled-
welcoming the sun’s warmth
Its rays tugging at the edges of 
my lips endearingly-like the hands 
of a small child
Gently coaxing a wider smile
I surrendered, beaming back 
with an equally radiant euphoria 
and peace

From the distance, a voice calls 
my name 
An elderly woman carrying a 
straw basket full of fresh methi 
leaves
From under her soft blue dupatta, 
her warm eyes beckon me forward

Inhale 
The air is room temperature but 
still manages to send shivers down 
my spine
Complying, I focus on putting 
one foot in front of the other to get 
to the front of the room
meanwhile, My stomach does 
somersaults
I fix my gaze on the bright 
fluorescent lights overhead 
As my teacher stumbles through 
my first and last name
Coffee stained teeth framed by 
garishly pink-painted lips send me 
back to my seat

As soon as I sit down, a crumpled 
piece of paper is tossed to my side of 
the desk
I reach for it without hesitation
a sweet innocent confession 
My questions about the origin 
of the note are answered by an 
eruption of muffled laughter from a 
nearby table

One boy with chestnut curls 
catches my eye and smiles
And a flood crashes through me
all at once, that note carried an 
invitation to belong and a reminder 
of my current isolation

A disapproving hush brings 
everyone’s rapt attention to the 
front of the room 
But before long, the words on the 
page blur out of focus
 
I’m 
watching 
perfectly 
mechanical manicured hands 

Inhale
In the air is a distinct hint of 
jasmine and the methi leaves I was 
holding 
Her fingers danced 
as they quickly threaded through 
the bunches of leaves
Easily pulling the leaves from 
their stems

I am mesmerized by the beauty 
in the simplicity
Her nails are bare and the skin on 
her hands is adorned by a myriad of 
wrinkles
her hands painted wisdom with 
each movement
Simple yet elegant

One hand reaches towards mine 
and lifts up my chin adoringly
Her eyes look into mine for 
answers
But I didn’t know how to put into 
words that
For a moment I feel like I’m 
sitting beside a tall, willow tree
Tall enough to shade me from the 
sun and strong enough to protect 
me from any storm 

I turn my head towards the sky 
again
Suddenly, the sun is nowhere to 

be seen
And clouds litter the horizon

Exhale
I watch my breath form a plume 
of water vapor in front of me
The dark clouds send down 
flurries in a torrent
We rush inside, letting the screen 
door slam behind us 

Nothing is out of the ordinary: 
A blaring TV, the smell of spices 
from the kitchen, the laundry 
machine whirring away
But, something was wrong 

As if to confirm my suspicions, 
The rice on the stove boils over
A mistake my ever so attentive 
mother 
wouldn’t 
dream 
of 
committing 

My feet guide me to the living 
room
My backpack still resting on my 
shoulders 
They wear poker faces but the 
anguish in their eyes is deafening
And 

I’m running 
I run until there’s no more land 
and icy water laps at my feet
My breathing is heavy

Exhale
Inhale
Exhale 
Inhale

But my feet stay grounded 
And the old woman in my 
memories 
The woman I was just beginning 
to know 
Is lost in time and some 8082 
miles

Forward: I have written extensively about how my Indian 
and American identities have shaped and influenced who 
I am as a person today. Those influences are largely 
positive however there are moments when walking the 
line between these two worlds is unduly painful and
especially difficult. This is one of those moments. This 
poem was inspired by the passing of my grandmother 
almost 10 years ago.

Your second favorite shade of yellow

E

very 
Wednesday 
morning 
of 
last 
semester 
I 
would 
walk down South University 
Avenue from my apartment 
to my sociology lecture in 
West Quad. As the days got 
colder and cloudier, I found 
comfort in a warmer future 
from the bright yellow that 
had overtaken one of the 
glass storefronts on South U. 
“SOULCYCLE – Your second 
favorite 
shade 
of 
yellow. 
See you soon, Ann Arbor.” 
was imprinted on the yellow 
backdrop. I did some research 
on the new fitness studio to 
see exactly what the hype was. 
From the videos I watched 
on YouTube, I observed that 
SoulCycle is a boutique fitness 
studio that creates a workout 
environment I would describe 
as similar to that of a Delta 
Tau Delta frat party: music 
raging, lights dimmed and 
sweat everywhere.
The 
first 
few 
times 
I 
passed 
the 
soon-to-be 
SoulCycle 
studio, 
I 
was 
excited – I thought it might 
be a fun outing for me and my 
girlfriends. Eventually this 
excitement wore off and was 
replaced by confusion.
In my sociology lecture, 
we discussed socioeconomic 
disparities. 
I 
began 
to 
associate 
what 
we 
were 
learning 
about 
the 
gaps 
between 
socioeconomic 
status and opportunity with 
the campus population, and I 
realized how absurd it was to 
have another boutique fitness 
studio pop up on campus. 
At SoulCycle’s new studio 
in Ann Arbor, a single class 
is $26. That could be spent 
on groceries, rent or more 
importantly, 
student 
debt. 
Paying that much for a fitness 
class is just not a realistic 
option for many students. 
Sure, there are out-of-state 
students at the University 
of 
Michigan 
getting 
their 
$51,200 
tuition 
paid 
by 

daddy’s 
money, 
but 
there 
are also students paying for 
their own tuition or receiving 
scholarship money. There is a 
lack of access to opportunities 
on 
campus 
for 
students 
from 
low-socioeconomic 
backgrounds, and fitness and 
healthy food are just a few 
examples.
The affordability of fitness 
has become a problem across 
the nation with the boom of 
boutique fitness studios and 
increased gym membership 
prices. When I went home 
for winter break I noticed 
that an Orangetheory and 
a Pure Barre, two popular 
boutique 
fitness 
studios, 
were now in the downtown 
strip mall right next to China 
Buffet and Kroger. I am from 
Grand Blanc, Mich., a town 
right outside of Flint, and I 
never would have expected 
those types of franchises to 
come to my town. However, 
franchise fitness studios like 
Orangetheory, 
Pure 
Barre 
and SoulCycle have become 
the new norm, especially for 
millennials.
For many in their mid-
20s, it is not so much about 
the act of getting in the day’s 
workout as it is being a part 
of the experience. SoulCycle 
and 
other 
popular 
fitness 
studios use platforms such 
as Instagram and Twitter 
to promote an experience 
that drives people to pay 
$26 or more for a 45-minute 
class. Many of the SoulCycle 
instructors are social media 
influencers with thousands 
of followers. The instructors 
also represent the brand by 
wearing clothing with the 
SoulCycle logo on it that can 
be purchased in studios or 
online. So, if you happen to 
have any money left in your 
bank account after you get 
done with cycling class, you 
can purchase a pair of their 
Ultracor 
Exclusive 
Python 
Skull Leggings for $198.

Studios like this exert a 
pressure on people who can’t 
afford to experience fitness 
like their peers can. Can the 
majority of college students 
really pay for this type of 
fitness?
No, most students can’t. I 
am guilty of succumbing to the 
millennial workout routines. 
During my freshman year on 
campus, I found myself going 
to a yoga class at the Tiny 
Buddha studio almost weekly. 
It was a nice break away from 
my studies and helped me 
to destress, but it also left 
a dent in my bank account I 
had to refill with a job that 
following summer.
Access 
to 
affordable 
healthy food is another major 
issue on campus and I didn’t 
recognize the shortage until 
I moved out of the dorms and 
started to cook for myself 
my junior year. There would 
be times between class I 
didn’t have time to stop 
home and would be looking 
for a quick, healthy, cheap 
lunch, 
but 
would 
usually 
end up choosing between an 
overpriced salad or a slice 
from South U Pizza. The new 
food options appearing on 
campus are tailored toward 
students that can drop $12 on 
a green smoothie.
It can be overwhelming 
when everyone at the gym 
is 
wearing 
Lululemon 
or 
students at the dining hall 
are talking about the workout 
class they just got back from. 
It is becoming increasingly 
expensive to keep up with the 
social demands of working 
out and eating healthy in 
Ann Arbor. The new boutique 
fitness studios and organic 
juice stores plopped right 
in the middle of campus are 
contributing to the price of 
fitting in and living healthy 
at U-M.

JATHAN DAY, ADRIENNE RAW AND DAVID GOLD | OP-ED

How college students meet the challenges of online writing
W

ith the proliferation 
of smartphones and 
Wi-Fi in schools and 
public spaces, access to social 
media has never been easier for 
students — or more worrisome 
for parents and teachers. A 
recent survey of U.S. teens found 
45 percent reporting that they 
are online nearly constantly. 
Parents 
worried 
about 
the 
effect of social media on school 
performance or social skills 
may respond by monitoring 
teens’ online activities, but 
such scrutiny may do more 
harm than good. Instructors, 
meanwhile, may ban laptops 
or phones in the classroom to 
eliminate “distractions,” but 
this too may have unintended 
consequences; 
for 
example, 
outing students with disabilities 
or 
inadvertently 
decreasing 
student engagement.
Despite 
the 
popular 
treatment 
of 
students 
as 
benighted 
“digital 
natives,” 
unaware of the effects of 
technology, 
young 
learners 
often recognize its influences 
and limitations, which may lead 
to more thoughtful decisions 
about what they write online, 
for whom and for what purpose. 
Students are also often aware 
of the particular challenges of 
writing in online environments 
— challenges that are not 
always acknowledged by their 
instructors.
As 
writing 
instructors, 
we wanted to know how our 
students feel about writing 
online. In the fall of 2018, we 
surveyed 803 undergraduates 
at a large, Midwestern public 
university about the kinds of 
online spaces they write in, 
the purposes and audiences 
for which they write, what 
they worry about when writing 
and how they respond to those 
worries. 
Our 
results 
(full 
findings to be published this 
year in “College Composition 
and Communication”) suggest 
that these young adults are 
as equally concerned about 
writing online as their parents 
and teachers — and that they 
are making thoughtful choices 
about their writing in response.
We asked students about 
their use of 11 popular online 
platforms. 
Though 
nearly 
80 percent had four or more 
accounts 
on 
social 
media 
platforms, Snapchat is the only 
one where more than 50 percent 
wrote frequently — that is, on 
a daily or weekly basis. For the 
other 10 platforms, less than 25 
percent of students reported 
writing frequently, and for all 
but three platforms (Facebook, 
Instagram and Snapchat), 60 
percent of students reported 
never 
writing. 
Thus, 
our 
students are clearly not the 
prolific 
digital 
writers 
we 
often 
imagine. 
Indeed, 
the 
most 
common 
activity 
on 
these platforms was reading, 
followed by commenting on 

other posts, suggesting a certain 
mindfulness about the writing 
of original content. Reading 
allows students to gauge the 
pulse (and, perhaps, the risk) 
of 
an 
online 
conversation, 
while 
commenting 
allows 
them to have a relatively low 
stake should they choose to 
participate.
One of the great fears about 
young adults writing online is 
that their activities will bring 
them into contact with the 
darker aspects of online culture: 
predators, 
cyberbullies 
and 
unknown others whose response 
to their still-forming opinions 
might have real consequences 
in their everyday lives. Yet 
the 
students 
in 
our 
study 
seem adept at limiting their 
audience to those they know 
and trust; most reported writing 
frequently only to family and 
friends, a trend hypothesized 
by other researchers. Despite 
the many communities that 
exist on social media centered 
on affinity spaces, professional 
organizations or the wider 
public, 
most 
participants 
reported never writing to these 
audiences.

Similarly, 
maintaining 
relationships with family and 
friends is the most common 
purpose for writing: Over 60 
percent of students reported 
writing 
frequently 
for 
this 
purpose. What students don’t 
do 
is 
write 
frequently 
for 
other 
purposes; 
developing 
professional identities, sharing 
information, posting creative 
work and debating controversial 
topics were purposes reported 
frequently by less than 25 
percent 
of 
students. 
This 
suggests that young writers 
feel most comfortable with 
the familiar and that they are 
more cautious when it comes 
to more public-facing entities, 
for 
which 
the 
stakes 
are 
higher. Even among family and 
friends, young writers engage 
in sophisticated practices to 
maintain a degree of privacy 
in networked spaces. Though 
any digital post can in theory 
be shared — and wind up read 
by unintended audiences — 
our findings suggest that most 
students try to control who 
reads their posts by writing in 
spaces where they have some 
degree of control over audience 
access.
The myth of the digital 
native suggests that young 

adults don’t worry about their 
online writing practices nearly 
as much as their parents and 
teachers. But our results suggest 
otherwise. The students we 
surveyed 
worry 
about 
the 
reactions of both intended 
and unintended audiences, the 
consequences of their writing 
being online forever and their 
ability or authority to write 
on various topics, with less 
than 30 percent reporting they 
never worry about each of these 
concerns.
For young writers online, 
these worries aren’t passive; 
in many cases, worry about the 
consequences of online writing 
leads these writers to edit or 
delete posts, or even to decide 
preemptively not to post. So 
while we might fear that young 
adults aren’t thinking about 
the consequences of writing 
online, they are — we just can’t 
“see” the results in a carefully 
edited or deleted post.
This doesn’t mean we should 
be any less aware of students’ 
writing habits or less concerned 
about 
the 
consequences 
of 
writing 
online. 
Rather, 
we 
must recognize that students 
may be more thoughtful about 
their practices than we’ve been 
giving them credit for. 
Our 
conversations 
must 
be likewise more complex, 
focused less on young adults’ 
awareness 
— 
which 
they 
already have — and more on 
what their awareness means 
for 
their 
participation 
as 
critical 
citizens. 
It 
might 
relieve parents to know that 
our study finds students tend 
to avoid writing that puts them 
at risk for public scrutiny, and 
while this is certainly not true 
of all teens and young adults, 
it does suggest that many are 
discerning participants in an 
increasingly online world. Nor 
we can fault students for their 
online writing practices when 
we are not offering alternatives; 
only 18 percent of those we 
surveyed have been assigned 
online writing in school. Our 
participants’ limited scope of 
writing practices might thus 
encourage instructors to find 
opportunities 
for 
showing 
students how they might use 
social media for creative and 
civic purposes, as well as better 
negotiate the potential pitfalls 
of public writing. Let’s leverage 
what students already know 
and help them use it to become 
active, 
thoughtful 
digital 
citizens.

ALLISON PUJOL | COLUMN

The empty promise of sanctuary cities

I

f you’re driving in downtown 
Miami, Fla. by 333 South 
Miami Avenue, you’ll likely 
spot Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement 
(ICE) 
officials 
waiting patiently in vans parked 
by the city’s Immigration Court. 
In a city that was formerly 
known as a “sanctuary city” for 
undocumented immigrants, ICE 
agents now notoriously arrest 
immigrants who’ve had their 
citizenship or asylum applications 
denied the second they step outside 
the courthouse entrance. The 
constant presence of ICE marks 
a stark departure for a city that 
once claimed to champion the 
rights of those attempting to create 
new lives for themselves and their 
families in the United States. 
A “sanctuary city,” as one 
immigration policy blog writes, is 
defined not as a place that refuses 
to 
prosecute 
undocumented 
immigrants but rather a locality 
that “limits its cooperation with 
federal immigration enforcement 
agents in order to protect low-
priority 
immigrants 
from 
deportation, while still turning 
over those who have committed 
serious crimes.” This definition 
has even expanded to apply to 
whole states that have adopted 
the “sanctuary” stance as formal 
state policy, such as California and 
Vermont. Progressives have often 
championed “sanctuary cities” 
as a way to subtly resist President 
Donald Trump’s new crackdowns 
on both legal and “illegal” flows of 
immigration, but there is room for 
doubt about the effectiveness of 
these local efforts. 
There are a few reasons to be 
suspicious of sanctuary cities’ 
real ability to provide a safe 
home for immigrants. First, local 
governments that claim to be 
outspoken defenders of immigrant 
rights often provide ICE with 
the information it needs to track 
down individuals to make arrests 
and searches. In California, as 
many as 80 local law enforcement 
agencies share automated license 
plate information and sometimes 
biometric information with ICE. 
This information is particularly 
concerning given ICE’s recent shift to 
electronic surveillance as a key tool 
to seek and arrest undocumented 
individuals, even going as far as to 
track individuals’ Facebook statuses. 

Recently, 
New 
York 
City 
mayor Bill de Blasio signed 
a bill that aimed to “protect 
(undocumented) people against 
… abuses” and broadly claims 
to strengthen NYC’s status as a 
sanctuary city. The mayor’s new 
bill calls for local law enforcement 
to limit its information-sharing 
efforts 
with 
immigration 
enforcement agencies. But there 
is currently no law to prohibit the 
New York City Police Department 
from 
contacting 
ICE 
about 
suspects or witnesses the police 
force investigates. Officers from 
the NYPD are even encouraged to 
share information with other task 
forces like the Joint Terrorism 
Task Force and the Department 
of Homeland Security fusion 
centers. 
Furthermore, 
ICE’s 
recent appearance at a Manhattan 
church that served predominantly 
Spanish-speaking 
communities 
after the bill’s signing sent a clear 
message about the legislation’s 
toothlessness. As a professor at 
New York University’s law school 
remarked, “the mayor of the City 
of New York does not hide people 
under his desk … People get 
deported from New York all the 
time.” 
Second, federal immigration 
enforcement often undermines 
state and local efforts to wiggle 
around 
the 
current 
policy. 
For 
the 
same 
reason 
that 
marijuana 
legalization 
and 
decriminalization efforts at the 
state level often run into conflict 
with federal prosecutors, local 
efforts to provide a haven for 
undocumented individuals are 
trumped 
(pun 
intended) 
by 
federal policy. Even in sanctuary 
cities that truly do use every legal 
tool at their disposal to oppose the 
Trump Administration’s policies, 
the steps they can take are 
consistently limited. Local police 
can bar ICE from establishing an 
office in their precinct, as New 
York City did at Rikers. Or cities 
can ban city government officials 
from cooperating with ICE before, 
during or after raids, as the city of 
Oakland mandated shortly after 
plans from ICE to initiate several 
raids in the Bay Area were leaked. 
But in reality, federal immigration 
enforcement agencies still have 
the ultimate authority to arrest 
whoever they like and local 

resistance is often unable to 
combat the massive surveillance 
and intimidation efforts that the 
DHS and ICE conduct. 
It’s not like local officials in 
so-called “sanctuary cities” even 
have much of a choice in the matter 
of what policies are enforced. 
Law enforcement in those cities 
and localities often depends on 
federal funding, and the federal 
government has threatened to 
withhold the money for those 
programs unless the cities in 
question comply with ICE efforts 
and the Trump Administration’s 
immigration policy goals. The 
threat alone is often enough to 
coerce local governments into 
reluctantly 
complying 
with 
federal policy and reversing their 
“sanctuary” status, as was the 
case in Miami.
Political change at the federal 
level is necessary to truly ensure 
a safe place for undocumented 
immigrants. This is not to say we 
should condemn local authorities’ 
resistance to ICE, as many cities 
have made official policy, but 
rather acknowledge that there is 
still important work that needs to 
be accomplished. Indeed, while 
some legal change is urgently 
needed at the local level, it would be 
dangerous to become complacent 
with localities’ designations of 
“sanctuary cities”. As Camille 
Mackler, the legal policy director of 
the New York Immigrant Coalition, 
said to the New York Times, placing 
“a bubble over a city where ICE 
can’t penetrate is not possible.”
As a student at the University of 
Michigan, it’s easy to be content with 
Detroit and Ann Arbor’s decisions 
to be sanctuary cities. Many 
homes in the city have “refugees 
welcome here” signs on their front 
lawns. But it’s also important to 
realize that the reality of federal 
immigration policy looms over any 
bumper sticker or lawn sign and 
has already had damaging effects 
on families and their communities 
in Michigan, even if some local 
authorities choose to turn a blind 
eye to immigration status. Until 
federal law substantially changes, 
no city can, in good faith, call itself 
a sanctuary for undocumented 
immigrants.

Monday, January 13, 2020 — 5A

If a show tells the same story as the one 
that it rebooted, then one might rightly 
ask why reboot it at all. By now, 1994 was 
26 years ago. It’s often not the case that 
what was relevant in 1994 still holds up 
in 2020. Thankfully, “Party of Five” left 
1994 in the past and caught up with 2020 
in a solid, if somewhat bland, reboot.
Instead of the white, middle class 
Salinger family, the reboot follows the 
lives of the five Acosta children, who are 
thrown into a furor after ICE shows up 
to their parents’ restaurant. While Javier 
(Bruno Bichir, “Che”) has papers for all 
his employees, he and his wife do not. Six 
weeks later, Javier and Gloria (Fernanda 
Urrejola, “Narcos: Mexico”) are being 
held at a detention center while the five 
kids struggle to maintain their home life. 
Beto (Niko Guardado, “The Goldbergs”) 
fights to keep the restaurant afloat, 
while previously-perfect Lucia (Emily 
Tosta, “The Resident”) lashes out in 
class. The eldest Acosta, Emilio (Brandon 
Larracuente, “13 Reasons Why”), tries to 
prioritize his aspiring music career over 
his family until he’s forced to move back 

home and look after his siblings. Despite 
Emilio’s best efforts — which amount to 
paying a top-notch immigration lawyer 
with money he didn’t really have to take 
his parents’ case — Javier and Gloria are 
deported back to Mexico, while the kids 

are left in America to fend for themselves.
In the ‘90s version of “Party of Five,” 
five siblings attempted to hold their 
family together after they lose both their 
parents in a car crash. The 2020 version 
holds a candle to the original. I believe it 
has some merit as its own entity. The show 
comes along in a wonderful era, helping 
usher in more TV that better reflects our 
diverse society. “Party of Five” joins the 
company of “Atlanta,” “Black-ish” and 
“Fresh Off the Boat,” plus plenty others, 
that attempt to present stories that are 
both diverse and introspective.
The show is more than politically 
relevant. In an age where immigrant 
children are being held at the border in 
cages, a show with a focus like that of 
“Party of Five” is needed, and perhaps 
even imperative. I think it’s important to 
understand that the Acostas are indeed 
victims of a broken system, yes, but 
they are not only victims. The parents 
are small-business owners, while their 
children are math-whizzes and musicians. 
I’m a bit worried the show will become 
so absorbed in its own calamities that it 
forgets the Acostas are people: ones whose 
experiences are not only their tragedies, 
but also their individualities. The Acotas’ 
experiences are deeply American. This 
should be expressed more explicitly.
On the bright side, the show is carried 
by strong pacing and a solid cast. While 
many 
writers 
might 
struggle 
with 
penning a precocious child, Valentina 
(Elle Paris Legaspi, “Animal Kingdom”) 
is just the right amount of quippy — and, 
not to mention, at a 9th grade math level. 
Likewise, Lucia’s lashing out is believable 
and restrained. The pilot is fast-paced and 

efficient, with the parents being arrested 
by ICE and losing their court hearing all 
in the same episode. At times, the show 
might benefit from a calmer pacing, 
taking more time to give the characters 
scenes in which to reckon events instead 
of simply responding to them. But I must 
admire the way the show positions itself 
so quickly.
By no means is “Party of Five” bad. As 
far as reboots go, it’s on the stronger side. 
I cannot give it enough credit for its timely 
update as well. That being said, the pilot 
left a lot to be desired. There are strong bit 
and more than enough groundwork that 
could turn into something special. But its 
strengths don’t stop it from being more or 
less standard, well-produced television. 
Here’s to hoping “Party of Five” hits its 
stride soon.

‘Party of Five’ gets a relevent update

TV REVIEW

In the spring of 1917, German forces in France’s Western 
Front retreated en masse, moving the front line back miles in 
Operation Alberich. On their way out, they were ordered to burn 
every building, crop and animal deemed potentially useful to 
their British enemies. German generals deemed it a successful 
operation, but Allied leaders lambasted the scorched earth 
warfare as barbaric. To the soldiers involved on both sides, 
however, Operation Alberich was just another day in hell. “1917” 
takes us there.
The movie throws the viewer into the inferno of World War I 
with the thunderous force of an artillery blast. George MacKay 
(“Captain Fantastic”) and Dean-Charles Chapman (“Game of 
Thrones”) play the two leads with endlessly complex yet subtle 
performances. These characters grab the viewer’s heartstrings 
and pull them with white knuckles all the way through No Man’s 
Land, on a desperate mission to save thousands of lives.
The unrelenting, unpredictable story is more survival horror 
than war flick, eschewing the nationalistic pitfalls that even the 
best war films (ie. “Dunkirk” and “Saving Private Ryan”) fall prey 
to. “1917” shows that war isn’t celebratory, necessary or heroic. 
It’s total apocalypse. The movie is presented in one take, a literally 

unblinking look at one of the worst and most momentous periods 
of history when war became fruitless, complete and mechanical 
destruction. Director Sam Mendes (“Skyfall”), composer Thomas 
Newman (“Skyfall”) and cinematographer Roger Deakins (“Blade 
Runner 2049”) have created a revolting, pulse pounding hellscape 
that, out of context, would likely be called a fantastical creation. 
Yet this is no Mordor. In “1917,” nightmare is everyday reality.
Bodies are buried in mud, frozen in rubble and draped in barbed 
wire, skin peeling to reveal stark white bone. Shrieking artillery, 
popping rifle fire and droning airplanes are permanent fixtures of 
the landscape, echoing through miles of charred desolation that 
was once quaint towns and green pastures.
In some scenes, especially those set in a burning medical city 
at night, the grandiose, insane destruction is almost beautiful, 
like a supernova that rips galaxies apart in a flurry of color 
before flaring into total darkness. Yet even in the face of this 
devastation, miraculously preserved pastoral landscapes emerge 
and disappear like portals to a different, peaceful world. In “1917,” 
dairy cows graze quietly next to farmhouses crushed by shellfire, 
and a river babbles through a thicket of green trees, then into a 
smoldering city filled with dead bodies. One sees the beauty that 

war obliterates, giving the film’s gut punch of a plot broader 
stakes that make it all the more terrifying.
“1917” grapples with the plague that is total warfare, right 
where it all began. What does a time like 1917 do to the people who 
inhabit it? Some soldiers buckle and cower, while others embrace 
the carnage. Perhaps most tragically, the majority simply become 
numb. MacKay’s character says he hates going home, because it 
reminds him that he has to go back to the trenches. Total war 
isn’t just confined to the battlefield. It destroys everything and 
everyone in its orbit, maybe indefinitely. 

As 2020 dawns, more than a hundred years away from 1917, the 
futility and unstoppable destruction wrought by modern warfare 
shows no signs of stopping. Somehow, leaders can’t or don’t 
notice that behind every operation on a map are terrified men 

and women, most of whom just want to survive and come home 
to their families. “1917” isn’t just thrilling, unforgettable cinema. 
It’s an urgent warning from a century ago that, as thousands of 
American troops head across the sea again, could not be more 
vital. 

World War I drama ‘1917’ is explosive, urgent cinema

FILM REVIEW

Japan’s Yellow 
Magic Orchestra

Few 
musical 
acts 
can 
convincingly 
claim 
they 
influenced the birth of several 
genres 
and 
sounds 
that 
transformed 
from 
local 
to 
global phenomena. Fewer still 
can straddle the line between 
relentlessly 
innovating 
and 
experimenting 
with 
new 
sounds and technologies while 
maintaining pop sensibilities that 
allow them to sell out stadiums. 
The Beatles, Kraftwerk and The 
Velvet Underground all fit this 
mold, but you may not have heard 
of the Tokyo-based band Yellow 
Magic Orchestra, who may be the 
most influential of them all.
Ryuichi Sakamoto, Yukihiro 
Takahashi and Haruomi Hasono 
were all prolific, skilled session 
musicians in the Tokyo music 
scene when they met and formed 
the group in the late 1970s. Each 
member of the group was heavily 
interested in the series of new 
synthesizers and drum machines 
introduced by companies like 
Moog and ARP. Together, they 
formed a coherent union of their 
individual experimentation.
The 
band’s 
early 
albums, 
including the self-titled debut 
and the 1979 album Solid State 
Survivor, are early examples of 
synthpop, featuring an intriguing 
mix of earnestness and kitsch, 
taking a Japanese perspective 
on 
Western 
Orientalism 
to 
fruitful 
effect. 
Even 
more 
interesting than the musical/
hardware innovations that the 
group 
pioneered 
were 
their 
philosophical musings, especially 
on Solid State Survivor. While the 
explosion of new technology in 
music brought about excitement, it 
also introduced a new set of fears. 
Tokyo was quickly becoming one 
of the most “futuristic” cities in 
the world, and while the growth 
of companies like Sony during the 
time helped boost the country’s 

economy to unseen heights, there 
was always the feeling that the 
new technologies could lead to an 
alienating dystopia.
This 
potential 
technology-
fueled 
dystopia 
would 
be 
explored for decades to come, 
from musicians like Burial as 
well as influential anti-capitalist 
writers including the late Mark 
Fisher. However, one of the 
earliest tangible results of YMO’s 
influence in this aspect was the 
development of a new genre in the 
suburbs of Detroit, a city in which 
new technology and automation 
destroyed nearly half its citizens 
livelihoods. Techno, as it was 
later 
dubbed, 
distilled 
these 
anxieties into a type of music 
known for its cold precision, 
devoid of swing and soul, yet 
still human. Derrick May, one of 
the genre’s creators, mentions 
YMO alongside Kraftwerk and 
England’s Ultravox as the key 
influences on its early sounds, 
before it would go on to become 
one of electronic music’s biggest 
successes.
In 
stark 
contrast 
to 
the 
dark sterility of techno, YMO 
also influenced the type of 
“hyperpop” embraced by idols in 
Japan and Korea in the 1980s and 
well beyond. Outside of Japan, 
tracks like “Firecracker” from 
the self-titled were sampled by 
artists ranging from 2 Live Crew 
to Mariah Carey as well as artists 
in the Bronx during the early 
days of hip-hop. “Behind the 
Mask,” on Solid State Survivor, 
was covered by Eric Clapton 
in 1987 and earlier by Michael 
Jackson 
during 
the 
Thriller 
sessions when famed producer 
Quincy Jones introduced it to 
him. 
While 
Jackson’s 
cover, 
which incorporated his own set 
of lyrics, did not make the final 
cut for Thriller due to copyright 
issues, it was eventually released 
in 2011 in the posthumous album 
Michael.

Gou or Die: Why Peggy Gou is the world’s universal DJ

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

Peggy Gou’s mixes seem to unlock something strange inside 
a person. Even on the first note of each song, the movements and 
repetition in her music are familiar, like every sound was waiting 
dormant inside of the listener, ready to be pulled out and collected 
into Gou’s unique mix of techno, house and disco. From bouncy 
beats to ethereal ambient soundscapes, her approach to production 
and live mixing is unlike most music today; she’s a master at 
creating a certain mood and scene, playing with music not only 
for her audience, but also for her own enjoyment. In a funny way, 
the South Korean DJ’s approach is very universal — Gou doesn’t 
submit herself to the rules and regulations of any certain subgenre 
of electronic music, she simply vibes. 
It’s this headstrong attitude that makes her music so inherently 
catchy, inviting her audience to move in whatever way they like 
through a jungle of sound. Gou is one of a growing number of 
female DJs who have established their careers in the Berlin club 
scene, developing her oeuvre among greats like Nina Kraviz and 
Helena Hauff. Despite this, she labels her own music as a kind of 
“K-House,” referring to her unique sensibilities as an East Asian 
woman in a largely European scene. But somehow, her international 
sensibilities — Gou grew up in South Korea, moved to London at 14 
for school and is now based in Berlin — make the DJ’s music that 
much more universal. The appeal of this familiarity with many 
different audiences is arguably the reason for meteoric rise in the 

last three years or so, culminating in a fashion line, over 100 shows 
a year across the globe, her own label Gudu Records and a devoted 
fanbase dedicated to “living the ‘Gou’ life.”
For Gou, the proof in the pudding is this internationality, with 
her two most popular singles, “Starry Night” and “It Makes You 
Forget (Itgehane)” featuring almost exclusively Korean lyrics. Sure, 
the chorus of “Starry Night” is in English, echoing “Ocean, night, 
star, song, moment / Ocean, starlight, moment, now, us” into the 
bass-heavy mix. But those words are as much percussion as the 
hi-hats and snares woven expertly throughout the song, serving 
as one small part of a larger picture. What really matters in Gou’s 

music is the feeling that each mix produces, what images it conjures 
in the listener’s mind, and the way they call your body to move 
whether you’re in a club or in the library. Her fingerprints are all 
over every part of every song, never a beat out of place. Listening 
to Peggy Gou is like looking at a tapestry, in some ways, both awed 
by the intricacy of the art and called to look further into its many 
threads. 
Her music is the first techno-house hybrid that seems truly 
approachable to the layperson in our times, disregarding the proven 

commercial success of something like EDM or dubstep in lieu of 
her own unique musical sensibilities. It’s Gou’s individualism that 
makes the DJ’s mixes so integrated into her listener’s lives — we can 
all see ourselves in her music, our heartbeats replicated by the BPM 
in her most popular songs, our footsteps slowly meshing with the 
pulsing bass as we walk along the street. You could say that about 
many electronic artists, yes, but Gou has mastered it. She deserves 
every praise that has flooded both niche and general channels in the 
years since her debut in London. Each mix of hers seems to reach 
inside the listener and pull out a rhythm that they were never aware 
of, controlling them like a marionette through an expert blend of 
sound, emotion and pure fun. Her fans’ homemade t-shirts say “Just 
Gou It,” and it’s easy to hop on the bandwagon of Gou-ing it too.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
Shane McCrae reads his newest collection of poems

The dim lighting obscured the faces, notebooks and seats of the 
subterranean auditorium. Shane McCrae draped his grey hoodie 
on a chair and perched his glasses on his face before ducking behind 
the podium in his red t-shirt. Seemingly abashed from the glowing 
introduction, McCrae cleared his throat and said he would be reading 
something he’s never read before. 
McCrae’s soft voice reconstructed the black ceiling of Helmut Stern 
Auditorium into a swirling sky of stars with his mythological, almost 
biblical tales, inverted to inject the African American and biracial 
experience. 

The poet regained his voice as the momentum of each poem charged 
into one another. “The Lost Tribe of Eden at the Beginning of the Day 
of Blood” begins with McCrae’s soft voice growing and turning as he 
fastens a boy unto a tree to see blood for the first time. A young boy 
seems to recur in these poems as the narrator, swept up in dreamlike 
tales of blood, death and bone. 
In “The King of the Sadness of Dogs”, the poet attributes the title of 
the poem to his daughter as she’s said a similar phrase before. Caught 
between a fairy tale and a cynical reality, McCrae’s simple diction 
woven into cosmic relevance aids in finding understanding in what it 
means to live and die in one’s skin, especially when one is confined by 
oppression. 
Each poem ends in a whisper and a flurry of papers being rearranged 
for a new reading. Prior to reading the work, McCrae introduced it with 
rarely more than a sentence of explanation of inspiration or anecdote. 
For “My Husband’s,” he joked that he wrote this love sonnet for his wife.
McCrae’s forthcoming book of poems “The Gilded Auction Block” 
arrives in June, with many poems set in heaven. He constructs a “multi-
heaven” viewed through the eyes of Jim Limber, a historical bi-racial 
orphan adopted by Jefferson Davis. McCrae uses Jim as a lens through 
which to speak on heaven. A multi-movement saga, Jim explores the 
stages of heaven in childlike surprise: He thought he’d be white. In 
the third movement, Jim considers the justification of evil and the 
existence of God. He muses on the idea that he can now have white 
things in heaven but not be white. He describes fields of grasses limp 
and brown, like death but with no people in sight. Jim finds God to be 

a Black woman. Jim takes us on a Dante-like journey through what he 
knows, sees and still struggles to understand. He finds crowds of Black 

people cheering him on to freedom. He writes his name in water. He 
discovers how the memory of one’s life works in death. He wonders 
if babies can be born in heaven. He ends up in limbo, wondering if he 
was born bad and pondering the ghosts that that haunt us in life and 
in death.
Jim Limber is at once a historical character and a contemporary 
vessel through which to make sense of a 21st century climate. McCrae’s 
latest collection recalls the tradition of looking towards the afterlife in 
hopes of making sense of living. LSA prof. Greg Schutz once referenced 
a writing from Matthew Zapruder that described it beautifully — poetry 
is the machine through which language is reignited. And, McCrae, a 
prolific poet for an uncertain age, never loses sight of the strange beauty 
of language in his poetry.

’ll preface this by saying: 
I hate 
writing 
about recruit-

the specula-

I hate the 
underlying 
transactional 
tomfoolery 
that is so 
abundant it’s 
best left unsaid. Grown adults 
begging (and paying) teenagers 
to come play for them. Other 
grown men and women living

opinions at every turn. It’s a 
fraught environment that I pre-
fer to stay away from, if possible.
But in this case, it’s getting 
pretty hard to ignore what’s 
going on with the Michigan 
men’s basketball team’s 2020 
class, both because of what it 
means for next year and what it 
means about the program. 
This is headed toward a Fab 
Five redux.
On Wednesday, BruinReport 
— the UCLA 247Sports.com 
page — reported that guard Josh 
Christopher, the No. 8 player 
in the 2020 class, is “just about 
certain to be going to Michigan.” 
Later that day, Jerry Meyer, the 
Director of Basketball Scouting 
for 247Sports, put in a “crystal 
ball” prediction for Christopher 
to Michigan. There is no one 
more reputable in the industry.
In a class that currently 
features four-star point guard 
Zeb Jackson, four-star wing 
Terrance Williams, five-star 
forward Isaiah Todd and four-
star center Hunter Dickinson, 
Christopher would be the crown 
jewel. It wouldn’t take more 
than a cursory YouTube search 

to realize why — he’s an athletic 
freak, with smooth handles and 
plenty of range. He’d walk onto 
campus the most electric player 
in maize and blue since … Chris 
Webber.
A commitment from the Lake-
wood, Calif. native would add 
a boost to a class that already 
ranks among the country’s 
best. And suddenly, in the first 
year under Juwan Howard, the 
Wolverines are on the verge of 
their best class since Howard 
himself orchestrated the most 
famous recruiting class college 
basketball has ever seen. Almost 
30 years later, the remnants of 
the “Fab Five” are still stitched 
into the ethos of this program, 

whether the athletic department 
wants to acknowledge it or not. 
Under John Beilein, Michi-
gan’s best class was the 2012 
class with Nik Stauskas, Mitch 
McGary, Glenn Robinson III, 
Caris Lavert and Spike Albrecht 
— which was ranked eighth. 
Robinson was also Beilein’s 
highest-ranked single recruit. 
Both Todd and Christopher 
would likely end up as “higher-
ranked” commits.
It’s worth considering what 
that means. Michigan is enter-
ing the rarified air of programs 
who can be a player for anyone. 
In any part of the country. In 
any year. That doesn’t inherently 
breed success, of course. In fact, 

there’s an argument swimming 
with the sharks isn’t the best 
way to truly compete in major 
college basketball. Excluding 
2008 (Beilein’s first class) and 
2019 (his last), the Wolverines 
averaged 35.2 in the 247Sports 
Composite rankings. Beilein led 
Michigan to the NCAA Tourna-
ment in nine of his 12 seasons, 
won two Big Ten Tournament 
titles and made two Final Fours. 
More generally, 68 percent of 
starters on the previous five 
national title winners have been 
upperclassmen. Among that 
group, only Duke in 2014-15 
started a majority freshmen. 
Experience matters, maybe now 
more so than ever.

There’s an obvious causal 
error in these statistics — less 
talent obviously does not hinder 
your chance of winning. 
And Howard has been clear 
from the jump that his inten-
tion is to reel in the best talent 
possible and make it work from 
there. There are still hurdles in 
the ever-changing landscape of 
recruiting that Howard and his 
staff must clear. Todd has been 
widely rumored to be consider-
ing spending his year before the 
NBA Draft overseas instead. 
Until pen meets paper, Christo-
pher is fair game to the schools 
who want him just as desper-
ately.
But reeling in Todd, Dick-

inson, Jackson, Williams and 
Christopher would be a haul 
few could have envisioned mere 
months ago. It shows, more than 
anything, that the cache Howard 
brought to Michigan matters to 
these kids. It shows his vision is, 
if anything, ahead of schedule, 
and that it didn’t take much on-
court success for that to trans-
late on the trail. Pulling that off 
would set the table for one of the 
most highly-anticipated Michi-
gan basketball seasons since the 
early ‘90s. Tickets would fly. 
Apparel would, too. I’ll never 
dare write the words “basketball 
school” in relation to Michi-
gan, other than in jest, but the 
intrigue would be incomparable. 
Things change, and there’s 
still a possibility this never 
comes to fruition. I have no idea 
what Josh Christopher or Isaiah 
Todd (or, oh yeah, Greg Brown, 
a five-star forward from Texas 
who will soon visit campus) are 
thinking. Recruiting is fluid and 
hectic. But there’s no under-
stating what this means for the 
direction of the program.
At Big Ten media day, Howard 
openly pleaded with someone to 
be the first. To take a leap and a 
risk. Then, he believed, the dom-
inoes would fall from there.
“I just feel that once one 
recruit commits, it’s going to be 
a rapid fire — everyone else will 
fall in,” Howard told reporters 
on Oct. 2, 2019. “Who’s willing 
to step in the front line and bet 
on themself first? I bet on myself 
first when I stepped in the line 
and I committed to Michigan. 
Are you willing to bet on your-
self?”
Twenty-nine years later, 
Howard bet on himself once 
again. The end result might be 
just as consequential.

Is Michigan on the verge of another Fab Five?

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — For the 
first two minutes, it looked like a 
nightmare start to the game for 
Michigan.
No. 14 Notre Dame (10-9-3 
overall, 5-5-2-1 Big Ten) came 
out fast after losing on Friday 
night, and just 1:45 into the game, 
a bouncing puck flipped over 
sophomore goaltender Strauss 
Mann’s shoulder before he even 
had a chance to make the save.
Eleven weeks ago, that kind 
of fluky goal to start a game 
was the Wolverines’ undoing on 
the road at Western Michigan. 
But Saturday night, Michigan 
(9-11-2, 4-7-1-0) came back to 
complete just its second sweep of 
the season, beating the Fighting 
Irish, 3-1.
“It’s just a puck that bounced 
two or three times and ends up 
in our net,” Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson said. “Just one of those 
things, but I like the resiliency. 
We’re starting to see that. Before, 
when things maybe went south a 
little bit, we were 
flat, but not in 
tonight’s 
game, 
and I think that’s 
a good sign going 
forward.”
After the early 
Notre Dame goal, 
Michigan settled 
in and shots were 
10-3 in favor of 
the 
Wolverines 
midway through 
the period. But despite two 
power-play opportunities in the 
period, Michigan couldn’t find 
twine to even the score.
It took until the Wolverines’ 
fourth opportunity with the 
man advantage to get on the 
scoreboard, 
but 
sophomore 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg 
didn’t hesitate when he saw the 
opportunity for the tying goal. 
Freshman defenseman Cam York 
identified a potential weakness 
on an earlier power play, and he 
told Blankenburg to pass it to 
him on the half-wall and he’d 
pass it back up to the blueline to 
Blankenburg for the shot.

It worked just as they’d 
discussed.
Blankenburg held onto the 
puck in the high slot, moving just 
enough to create a shooting lane 
for himself, and he snapped in 
a shot that Notre Dame wasn’t 
expecting. It found the top corner 
of the net behind goaltender Cale 
Morris, tying the score at one.
“That was big, because we’d 
had 
a 
lot 
of 
pressure on them 
and hit a couple 
posts (and the) 
crossbar 
there 
on one, so that 
was a big goal,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“We did a good 
job 
there. 
We 
stayed with it, for 
the most part.”
After 
Blankenburg tied things up, it 
seemed as though the ice tilted in 
Michigan’s favor. The Wolverines 
outshot the Irish 18-7 in the 
period, and it took just a few more 
minutes after Blankenburg’s goal 
for Michigan to take the lead.
Senior forward Will Lockwood 
worked his way around the 
offensive zone and fired a pass 
from the blueline to sophomore 
defenseman Jack Summers as he 
worked in in front of Morris. In an 
instant, Summers switched from 
his forehand to his backhand 
and sent the puck over Morris’s 
shoulder, handing Michigan a 2-1 
lead that proved decisive.

In 
the 
third 
period, 
the 
Wolverines 
held 
strong 
defensively against a Notre Dame 
team that pressured hard to find 
the tying goal. The Wolverines 
seemed content to sit back and 
defend their one-goal lead, and 
with Mann as the backstop, 
Michigan kept the Irish off the 
scoresheet.
“They were just trying to play 
long and get pucks behind us, and 
we were just trying to get pucks 
out,” Blankenburg said. “I think 
we did a good job as a D-corps 
and as forwards, and Strauss 
helped us out a lot, too, with 
getting pucks out of our zone and 
in their zone.”
With just 19.1 seconds left, 
senior 
forward 
Jake 
Slaker 
hit the empty net for his third 
empty-net goal of the season to 
seal Michigan’s first sweep in Big 
Ten play.
Just over halfway through 
the conference schedule, the 
Wolverines sit in fifth place, but 
with four wins in their last six Big 
Ten games, Pearson is hopeful 
that the sweep over the Irish will 
be a launchpad for a run in the 
second half of the year.
“I can’t put it in words how 
big (this sweep) is,” Pearson said. 
“It helps us get those critical 
points in the Big Ten. We’re 
now halfway through the Big 
Ten. We don’t like where we’re 
standing, but we have something 
to say about the future, and that’s 
good.”

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — When 
the second period started, the 
Wolverines’ bench was missing a 
familiar face.
Eighty-five feet across the ice 
from his team, freshman Johnny 
Beecher sat in the penalty box. 
He’d been whistled for tripping 
with 14 seconds remaining in 
the first period, and Michigan 
— already trailing No. 14 Notre 
Dame 1-0 — was forced to start 
the period on the penalty kill.
But the Wolverines didn’t 
panic. On Friday night, they’d 
successfully killed all three of 
their penalties. On Saturday, 
Beecher’s penalty was already 
their second test of the night. 
Michigan knew it needed to 
have a strong second period to 
have a chance at winning the 
game. And when the penalty kill 
units stepped over the boards 
and onto the ice, they set the tone 
for Wolverines’ next 20 minutes.
After a string of blocked 
shots, zone clears and one 
short-handed 
scoring 
chance 
from fifth-year forward Jacob 
Hayhurst, Beecher skated out of 
the box.
“Every penalty kill is big,” 
sophomore forward Garrett Van 
Wyhe said. “Especially with the 
power play that Notre Dame has, 
and its shooting mentality. So (we 
knew) we’d have to block a lot of 
shots, and that’s exactly what we 

did. (Killing that penalty) helped 
our momentum.” 
But the penalty kill wasn’t the 
only strong point for Michigan 
that period. 
The 
Wolverines 
increased 
their intensity and physicality, 
while 
also 
maintaining 
confidence in their game plan. 
These changes in Michigan’s 
play were instantly noticeable. 
After having ten shots on net 
in the first twenty minutes, it 
tallied 18 in the second, and the 
defense stepped up, too. The 
Wolverines blocked six of the 
Fighting Irish’s seven shots in 
the period.
“We knew we needed to get 
pucks on net,” Van Wyhe said. 
“We knew we needed to get 
behind them. That was how it 
was going to work and how we 
were going to get on top of them 
and we just started doing the 
little things.”
With 
Beecher’s 
penalty 
behind them, the Wolverines 
focused on closing the gap 
between them and Notre Dame. 
When they earned a power play 
opportunity at the halfway point 
of the second period, they knew 
they needed to capitalize on it.
Freshman defenseman Cam 
York skated with the puck and 
looked for an open teammate. 
Just in front of the blue line, 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Nick 
Blankenburg called for a pass. 
When the puck made contact 
with his stick, he skated laterally 

then fired a shot past the 
reaching glove of the Fighting 
Irish’s goaltender. 
“(Cam York) said, ‘Hey, give 
it to me, I’m gonna go lower and 
give it back up to (you) and shoot 
it,’ ” Blankenburg said. “I feel like 
we talked about that, and then 
it’s just all about execution.”
With 
Blankenburg’s 
goal, 
Michigan had tied the game. Its 
attention to detail was paying off 
and the game was within reach. 
The impressive second period 
wasn’t the result of an intense 
intermission speech, though.
“We didn’t say anything,” 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
said. “There was no magical 
speech (after the first period), 
it was just stay with it, and 
continue to play. We just talked 
about trying to get the puck 
behind their defensemen to put 
some pressure on them.”
Riding a wave of momentum 
from Blankenburg’s goal, the 
Wolverines’ offense continued 
to generate chances and their 
defense remained rock solid. 
Just 
five 
minutes 
after 
Michigan tied the game at one, 
it took the lead on a goal from 
sophomore 
defenseman 
Jack 
Summers.
Senior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood 
weaved 
through 
traffic in the offensive zone with 
the puck on his stick. Summers 
streaked towards the net on the 
left side and Lockwood fed him 
the puck in between two Notre 
Dame defenders. 
Summers 
outstretched 
his 
stick to corral the pass then 
moved towards the net. He cut 
across the mouth of the goal and 
finished the puck off a backhand 
shot.
After entering the period 
trailing a goal, the Wolverines 
had managed to take the lead, 
2-1. 
“That second period was one 
of the best periods we’ve had this 
year,” Pearson said. “I thought 
we took it to them.”
And when the buzzer rang out 
to signal the end of the game, it 
was those middle 20 minutes 
that determined the outcome of 
the game.

Loss shows lack of progress

In the Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s first game 
against 
Maryland, 
the 
Wolverines 
turned 
the 
ball 
over 23 times, shot 1-of-12 from 
3-point range and got no points 
from their bench — three issues 
that have plagued them all 
season and cost them a huge 
road win.
Entering Michigan’s second 
game 
against 
Maryland, 
sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon 
stressed 
that 
the 
Wolverines needed to make sure 
these issues wouldn’t cost them 
again.
But from the start of Sunday’s 
game, it was clear they would 
be a factor. After Michigan 
(11-5 overall, 2-3 Big Ten) 
scored on its first possession 
and prevented the Terrapins 
(12-4, 3-2) from getting on the 
board for the first 2:30, the 
Wolverines turned the ball over 
six times in six minutes, scoring 
just two points. The sloppy play 
allowed Maryland to jump out 
to an eight-point lead that only 
grew bigger, resulting in a 77-49 
Michigan loss.
“You have certain players you 
want to get to, certain players 
you want to give it to at certain 
times, and when you can’t do 
that you get out of the flow of the 
offense,” senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson said. “They were just 
denying our next pass or taking 
away what we really wanted to 
do.”
As poorly as the first quarter 
went for the Wolverines, it 
only got worse in the second. 
Michigan turned the ball over 
six more times in the first four 
minutes of the quarter as the 
Terrapins went on a 9-2 run. 
Even 
with 
Maryland’s 
two 
leading scorers — guard Kaila 
Charles and forward Shakira 
Austin — combining for just 
two points in the first half, the 
Wolverines trailed by 16 at the 
break.

“They just took away passing 
lanes, really denied our lanes,” 
Johnson said. “They switch one 
through five and then have the 
help side, so we’re not really 
used to teams switching one 
through five the entire game, 
even the smallest screen. So 
really finding plays to get people 
open because most plays they 
know so they just stand there.”
With 
Michigan’s 
starters 
struggling and playing sloppily, 
an all too familiar situation 
arose. They could have used 
someone to come off the bench 
and provide a spark, but the 
Wolverines’ 
bench 
players 
combined for just four points 
prior to the fourth quarter, 
when the game was well out of 
reach.
The 
Terrapins, 
unlike 
Michigan, found points from 
their secondary scorers. With 
Austin on the bench in foul 
trouble and Charles struggling, 
Maryland turned to guards 
Diamond Miller and Ashley 
Owusu — both of whom came 
off the bench — along with Blair 
Watson to lead the offense. 
The trio combined for 25 of the 

Terrapins’ 37 first-half points.
“We thought if we did a 
great job on Kaila Charles 
we would put ourselves in 
a really good position to be 
successful,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim Barnes Arico said. “We 
did a tremendous job on taking 
people out, but then we didn’t 
take out the other people. We let 
other people get hot. It’s gotta 
be a total team defensive effort.”
In the second half, needing a 
huge comeback, the Wolverines 
looked 
to 
gain 
momentum 
with 
3-point 
shooting. 
But 
the inability to consistently 
shoot threes that has afflicted 
Michigan all season continued, 
as the Wolverines made 1-of-
8 attempted 3-pointers in the 
second half.
While Michigan took better 
care of the ball in the second 
half — committing just eight 
turnovers as opposed to 14 — the 
Wolverines had dug themselves 
too deep of a hole. In the end, 
their inability to correct the 
same problems that have hurt 
them all season and lost them 
in the first Maryland matchup 
proved fatal.

F

ollowing its heartbreak-
ing one-point loss to 
Maryland in the Big Ten 
Tournament semifinals last 
season, the Michigan women’s 
basket-
ball team 
entered 
this year 
looking for 
revenge. 
Two 
weeks ago 
in College 
Park, the 
Wolverines 
played the 
Terrapins 
close for three quarters before 
Maryland pulled away and won 
by 15, adding more fuel to the 
fire for Sunday’s matchup at 
Crisler Center. 
But instead of providing a 
fierce, hotly contested battle 
among top Big Ten teams, 
Michigan came out flat and 
played anxious, mistake-ridden 
basketball. In their 77-49 loss, 
the Wolverines endured many of 
the same struggles that plagued 
them in losses earlier this season 
— including turning the ball over 

14 times in the first half alone. 
“Our kids have played well 
against some top teams this 
year, so they really felt like this 
was an opportunity for us to get 
them at home,” Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico said. “We 
wanted to get Maryland back, 
and we came in really trying to 
do that, and I think that made 
us turn the basketball over a lot 
early.”
Points are typically hard to 
come by for any team that plays 
the Terrapins. Their size and 
athleticism helps them hold 
opponents to just 54.3 points per 
game on 34.7 percent shooting 
— good for 15th and 25th in the 
country, respectively. 
But in the first half, the Mary-
land defense 
didn’t do too 
much to stifle 
the Wolverines’ 
shooting, as they 
shot a respect-
able 41.7 percent 
from the field. 
Instead, Michi-
gan’s problems 
stemmed from 
its turnovers, 
which forced 
a low volume of shots. Though 
the two teams shot at about the 
same efficiency, the Wolverines 
attempted just 24 shots in the 
first half, which, when compared 
to Maryland’s 36 attempts, put 
Michigan in a nearly impossible 
position to succeed. 
“I think that we’re just being 
kind of loose with the ball. We 
just think that the next pass will 
be there,” senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson said. “We’re starting to 
face teams that are just as long, 
just as quick as us, so we have to 
realize just like we’re long and 
quick, we’re athletic, we can 
jump, things like that — other 
teams can do that too.”
In the second half, the Wol-
verines cleaned up the turn-
overs, but couldn’t hit any shots 
to get back in the game. Similar 
to the first game against the Ter-
rapins — where Michigan shot 

1-of-12 from three — the Wolver-
ines only hit 1-of-8 second-half 
3-pointers. They tried to work 
it inside to sophomore forward 
Naz Hillmon, their most reli-
able scorer. But with the threes 
not falling, Maryland was able 
to close out down low and limit 
Hillmon’s effectiveness in the 
paint. Michigan made 14-of-38 
layups on the game. 
“(Maryland’s) size up front is 
pretty big,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We were going strong to the 
basket, but one, we didn’t finish, 
and two, we were knocked off 
the ball a little bit. But we gotta 
be able to make those plays.”
Against Penn State and 
Michigan State, the Wolverines 
played clean, disciplined basket-
ball and indicat-
ed they may have 
moved past their 
turnover-prone 
offense. Sunday, 
against arguably 
the best team in 
the Big Ten, the 
Wolverines had 
an opportunity 
to prove they’re 
ready to take the 
next step up as 
a program, but missed it rather 
badly.
Still, the Terrapins won’t be 
Michigan’s last chance to make 
a statement this season. Though 
they missed a golden opportu-
nity against an elite level team, 
the depth of the Big Ten this 
year means the Wolverines have 
plenty more high-profile games 
to show they can compete at the 
highest level. 
For now, question marks 
will continue to surround this 
Michigan team. With the talent 
the Wolverines have, they likely 
haven’t yet reached their ceiling, 
but they first need to clean up 
their mistakes. 
Otherwise, they may never 
find it.

Wolverines fall to Gophers, 75-67 

MINNEAPOLIS — Marcus 
Carr was calculating.
With Zavier Simpson staring 
right back at him and over 
10,000 Golden Gophers’ fans 
anxiously awaiting his next 
move, Carr proved once again 
to be a steady hand.
The 
Minnesota 
point 
guard floated to the left wing, 
dragging Michigan’s defense 
with him, and rifled a pass back 
across his body to the opposite 
side of the floor. The recipient 
was Payton Willis, and despite 
being scoreless to that point, 
Willis had time to set his feet, 
compose himself and drain a 
25-footer. 
The Wolverines needed a 
stop on that possession, with 
their deficit at eight and just 
over a minute remaining in 
regulation. Instead, they gave 
up a wide-open 3-pointer.
In what had been a sleepy 
Sunday afternoon start was 
far from lethargic by the end. 
Thanks, in part, to Carr’s play 
down the stretch, the Gophers 
(10-7 overall, 3-3 Big Ten) 
outlasted Michigan (11-5, 2-3) 
in a back-and-forth bout, 75-67.
With 
students 
still 
on 
winter 
break 
and 
a 
noon 
tipoff, Williams Arena was 
eerily quiet for much of the 
first half. Michigan’s efficient 
start offensively also tempered 
enthusiasm.
Simpson 
might’ve 
been 
running the show, but the 
Wolverines 
had 
a 
well-
balanced 
scoring 
attack 
— 
freshman wing Franz Wagner, 
sophomore forward Brandon 
Johns Jr. and senior center Jon 
Teske were all involved. Late in 
the first half, Michigan held a 
30-19 lead. 
“They had six threes early,” 
Minnesota 
coach 
Richard 
Pitino said. “We were there, but 
we weren’t jumping. They’ve 
got some size. Wagner’s big 
and a couple of their guards 
are bigger than we are, but 
we were letting them get too 
comfortable. They push you 
through ball screens and make 

you make a decision about what 
you’re going to do.”
That 
advantage 
masked 
the fact that the Gophers’ 
Daniel Oturu was going to 
work down low — consistent 
with 
Michigan’s 
defensive 
philosophy to withhold the 
double-team for the opposing 
big man. Whether it was Teske 
or backup center Austin Davis, 
Oturu got whatever he wanted. 
Sparked by Oturu and a 
few big baskets from Carr, 
Minnesota went on a nine-
point tear, cutting what was a 
once-sizable gap down to a one-
point deficit at halftime. 
And with the momentum in 
their team’s favor, the Gophers’ 
faithful came to life. 
Oturu picked up where he 
left off following his 20-point 
first half. After trading baskets, 
he slammed home an alley-
oop off a feed by Carr to give 
Minnesota a 45-41 advantage 
by the first media timeout of 
the second half. 
“I thought in the first half, we 
were very active defensively,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Juwan 
Howard said. “We contested a 
lot of their shots, able to get the 
rebound, were active with our 
hands. In the second half, Carr 
was very patient off pick and 
rolls, and was good at reading 
where the defenders are. You 
can’t speed him up and has a 
nice pace to his game.”
The Wolverines had been 
knocked back on their heels. 
When Oturu went down hard 
on a rebound attempt and left 
the game for three minutes of 
the second half, Michigan saw 

a slight opening. 
Simpson, as he has done so 
often over the course of his 
career, shouldered the burden 
and clawed his team back into 
the contest. The senior point 
guard hit his patented hook shot 
in the lane, sank a contested 
3-pointer from the top of the 
key and found Wagner behind 
the arc again. 
On the opposite end, Carr, 
who finished with 21 points, 
weathered 
the 
storm 
for 
the home team. Both teams 
continued to exchange buckets 
as crunchtime approached. By 
the 4:30 mark, the game was 
knotted at 62. 
The Gophers’ steadiness and 
composure won out, though. 
Minnesota scored 10 straight 
points to send the Wolverines 
packing. Oturu finished off 
his 30-point outing with a 
layup 
underneath 
before 
Alihan Demir hit a floater. On 
a turnover by sophomore guard 
David DeJulius, Carr sank two 
free throws.
Up five, but with the game 
still very much up for grabs, 
Willis’ spot-up shot on the 
Gophers’ next trip down the 
floor finally allowed their fans 
to exhale. 
“The ball didn’t go in the 
basket for us.” Howard said. 
“We 
weren’t 
aggressive 
enough, and confident enough 
to get our shot down there on 
our end. They scored again … it 
was like score, stop, score, stop. 
Unfortunately, we didn’t get 
a chance to capitalize on any 
of our offensive sets down the 
stretch.”

Michigan hangs on to beat Spartans

The usual complement of 
maize and blue on display in 
Cliff Keen Arena’s bleachers was 
diluted with green and white, a 
group whose raucous cheering 
filled the gym from the opening 
match.
But it was the home crowd 
who 
would 
cheer 
last 
and 
loudest, as the No. 25 Michigan 
wrestling team (2-2 overall, 1-0 
Big Ten) weathered a late rally 
by Michigan State (4-3, 0-1) to 
topple their rival, 22-14.
The Wolverines wasted no 
time asserting themselves. In 
the first period alone, redshirt 
sophomore Jack Medley accrued 
over a minute of riding time on 
the Spartans’ Logan Griffin. 
Medley’s performance paved the 
way for a 13-4 major decision in 
the 125-pound weight class.
Medley’s 
teammates 
capitalized on his hot start, as 
133-pound redshirt freshman 
Joey Silva made his season 
debut with a decision over 
Garrett Pepple. Thanks to the 
contributions of 10th ranked 
redshirt junior Kanen Storr and 
No. 15 redshirt freshman Will 
Lewan, Michigan exited the first 
half up, 16-0.
“For a guy (Silva) that hasn’t 
competed in quite a while, he had 

great composure in that match 
and managed positions really 
well,” Michigan coach Sean 
Bormet said. 
The 
Wolverines’ 
early 
successes were typified by the 
efforts of 141-pound freshman 
Cole Mattin. His patient probing 
of Matt Santos’ tendencies for 
two tense periods was rewarded 
with a lunging takedown aimed 
at Santos’ exposed legs.
“I knew that shot was there 
from the beginning, but I just 
didn’t take it yet,” Mattin said. 
“Whatever you can do to win, 
you’ve gotta do.”
Added Bormet: “We were 
getting 
the 
takedowns 
and 
building our riding time and 
taxing those guys on the bottom.
We did a good job setting the 
offense, getting to our leg attacks 
and getting a lot of takedowns.”
The second half would not 
proceed nearly as smoothly for 
Bormet’s wrestlers — the team 
went on to drop four of the next 
five matches to Michigan State. 
The 
riding 
time 
advantage 
which 
had 
resulted 
in 
so 
many takedown opportunities 
disintegrated, forcing Michigan’s 
wrestlers to claw their way out of 
steep deficits. 
In 
the 
174-pound 
match 
between redshirt freshman Max 
Maylor and the Spartans’ Layne 
Malczewski, a flaw in Maylor’s 

technique 
compounded 
the 
freefall. 
“He made one mistake in the 
position of his arm,” Bormet said. 
“If he doesn’t make that mistake 
and finishes that takedown, it’s a 
totally different match.”
As Michigan State’s Nick 
May slipped past redshirt senior 
Jackson Striggow for a hard-
fought 5-2 decision — bringing 
his team within two points of 
the tying score — he waved to the 
Spartan supporters, who erupted 
in applause. 
But the comeback fell short, 
as the Wolverines’ decorated 
heavyweight, 
sophomore 
Mason Parris, pinned Christian 
Rebottaro in 29 seconds, securing 
a 22-14 win for Michigan in 
dramatic fashion. 
“I just wanted to get the crowd 
pumped and put an exclamation 
point on our dual win,” Parris 
said. 
Although 
the 
Wolverines’ 
errors cut into their lead, they 
were not so significant as to 
derail their victory. The team’s 
strong start ensured as much, 
and the Michigan wrestlers 
denied the hostile elements of 
the crowd an opportunity to faze 
them.
“That’s the great thing about 
wrestling,” Bormet said. “We 
drown ourselves in adversity 
every day.”

Oturu scores 30 as
Michigan falls below
.500 in Big Ten play

 MINNEAPOLIS — A Big Ten center had a huge game against the Michigan men’s basketball team. 
Again.
 Early in the season, this story wrote itself in nearly every Big Ten matchup the Wolverines played. 
Michigan plays a team with a dominant big man. Big man has a career night in the points column. 
Questions arise about the Wolverines’ interior defense. Repeat.
 While their strategy initially drew mixed results with Michigan standing at 2-3 in conference play, 
Sunday’s matchup against Minnesota saw the Wolverines’ game plan backfire, sending Michigan packing 
with a 75-67 loss and a squandered attempt to win its first road game.
 The strategy is simple enough: Never double the ball handler in the post and ruthlessly guard the 3-point 
line.
 Whether it’s a 7-foot-5 behemoth who leads the league in points in the paint or an ambitious wing player 
posting up his defender, Michigan never sends help. While lowering the barriers to easy buckets down 
low, this philosophy lends itself to lock-down defense from the perimeter. And, for the most part, the 
Wolverines have succeeded in that realm.
 Seeing as opponents rarely attempt shots from beyond the arc against Michigan, their scoring — and the 

bulk of the Wolverines’ defensive problems — come from the paint. Sunday, that problem was put on 

full display with Golden Gophers center Daniel Oturu gashing Michigan for 30 points and the team, 

as a whole, scoring a whopping 46 points in the paint.

 “We’re just playing them one-on-one,” senior center Jon Teske said. “We’re not helping off the 

3-pointers. … We let them play down low, and we take away the 3-point shooting ability. In the 
Big Ten, we have a lot of great 3-point shooters, and that’s one way you can get beat, and we’re 
trying to take that away.”
 And it wasn’t just Oturu who got in on the action. After the sophomore went down briefly 
with a shoulder injury early in the second half, forward Alihan Demir stepped up and dropped 
13 of his own, largely from within the paint, posting up freshman forward Franz Wagner.
 As it stands, there is a gaping hole in Michigan’s defensive front, despite the individual 
efforts of its best on-ball defenders. The question now becomes whether or not to make any 
adjustments to limit the elite play down low.
 Early indicators suggest that Michigan coach Juwan Howard will be mulling over some 
adjustments with his players and staff. After all, Michigan’s strategy seems to have the 
effectiveness of a coin flip.

 The Wolverines have won games despite opposing centers setting career — and 
sometimes program — highs. Iowa’s Luka Garza dropped 44 points and Purdue’s 

Trevion Williams nabbed 36 in Michigan wins. But now, it seems prolific play down 

low from opposing big men is rearing its head in losses, too.

 “Of course I will (reevaluate the defense),” Howard said. “I always reevaluate. I’m 
always about growth mindset.”
 Added Teske: “We’ll look at it on the drawing board. We play Iowa next, and 
(Luka Garza) had a big game against us, but we still won, so I mean just you gotta 
pick your poison sometimes. And we kinda let them get the points, and they’re still 
gonna score.”
 But the question during this reevaluation period should really boil down to: Is 
this defensive scheme broken, or does Michigan need to bolster its one-on-one 
on-ball defense?
 Ask any Wolverine following a loss, and they’ll be quick to tell you that everyone 
needs to get better at guarding their man. Especially when big men are setting 
career highs every time they see maize and blue on the opposing jerseys.
 “A lot of it is still on me,” Teske said. “I still gotta get stops. I still gotta stay 
accountable for a lot of those points that I’m giving up. I gotta do a better job of 
helping my teammates, and at the same time, we need to get better defensively too, 
guarding the low post.”
 There is little wonder that this philosophy stems from Howard’s time spent in the 
NBA and his firsthand experience, and subsequent perpetual fear, of the terror the 
3-point shot can bring upon defenses. Eliminate the 3, eliminate the most efficient 
method of scoring the basketball.
 “There’s a lot of teams that don’t trap,” Minnesota coach Richard Pitino said. “Coach 

Howard knows what he’s doing. Trapping isn’t always as easy as everybody thinks 

it is because we’ve got shooters who make 10 3s a game, we pass the ball 

pretty well.

 “So, we just had to keep going into them, and they guarded 

the 3-point line very, very well, and obviously they held us 

below their average, but we have to find a way to get 

(Oturu) post touches, and we did that.”
