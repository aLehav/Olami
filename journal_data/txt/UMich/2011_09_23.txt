'U' NAACP, Black
Student Union
organize vigil after
death of executed man
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Doily Stuff Reporter
More than 100 people gathered on
the Diag last night for a candlelight
vigil to commemorate the life of a
man who they believe was wrongly
executed for murder.
Troy Davis was executed Wednes-
day night, more than 20 years after
being arrested for the murder of an

off-duty white police officer in Geor-
gia. The case made headlines around
the world, as many believed that
Davis was wrongly convicted.
The vigil, organized by the Uni-
versity's chapter of the NAACP and
the Black Student Union, included
a moment of silence for Davis and
his family and speeches from people
opposed to the death penalty.
"It wasn't about that he was a black
man," Janee Brown, president of the
University's chapter of the NAACP,
said in an interview at the vigil.
"There was so much doubt in that
case."
Of the nine main witnesses origi-
nally in the trial, seven have recanted

Balloon festival part of
Go North! Initiative to
attract more students
to North Campus
By JENNIFER LEE
Daily StaffReporter
When students go to North Cam-
pus, they usually take the bus to go to
Engineering or Music, Theatre & Dance
classes. But yesterday, more than 150
people traveled on North Campus to

take a hot air balloon ride 100 feet into
the sky.
The hot air balloon festival was one
of the first events launched by the Go
North! Initiative, a new program devel-
oped by the Division of Student Affairs
that aims to bring more students, events
and excitement to North Campus. Yes-
terday's event featured one tethered hot
air balloon - provided by Renaissance
Balloons, Inc. in Howell, Mich. - in
which students and families from near-
by Northwood Community Apartments
could take a three-minute ride.
Elizabeth Zollweg, the project man-
ager of Go North!, said the initiative's

mission is to attract more students to
events, lectures and recreational activi-
ties to an area of the University not
often frequented by the majority of the
student body.
"You don't have to go down to Central
or South (Campus) ... There are really
great, fun, new innovative things hap-
pening on North," Zollweg said.
The program was launched partly
in response to the larger population of
students living on North Campus than

UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
Researchers replicating Mars
conditions to test for water, life

AOSS professor
examining if brine
can sustain life
By ZACH BERGSON
Daily StaffReporter
Three years after discovering evi-
dence of water on Mars, Nilton Renno,
a University professor of Atmospheric,
Oceanic and Space Sciences, is looking
for life on the planet.
Renno is leading a $1 million NASA-

funded project to determine if liquid
water can exist on Mars and whether
that water can sustain life.
In 2008, Renno was the co-investi-
gator of the Phoenix Mars Mission - a
NASA project led by a group of Univer-
sity researchers - that found evidence
of liquid brine on the surface of Mars by
analyzing soil and photos of the planet.
The discovery was the first of its kind
and raised questions about whether
Mars, which has extremely low air pres-
sure and drastic temperature swings,
could sustain life.
According to Renno, the first step

of his current project is replicating the
conditions on Mars - that the mission's
lander experienced inthe 2008 project -
to further explore whether the existence
of liquid water on the planet is possible.
However, according to Rackham student
Harvey Elliott, a Ph.D. candidate in the
AOSS department, the liquid water on
Mars is very different from water on
Earth.
"Pure water would either evaporate
or sublimate directly from ice to gas on
Mars," Elliot said.

STUDENT COMPETITION
Accelerate Michigan collecting students' business proposals

Competition aims to
improve state economy
through student ideas
By SABIRA KHAN
Daily StaffReporter
As the state continues to struggle eco-
nomically, one competition is encourag-
ing students to help stimulate growth in
Michigan through their innovation and
entrepreneurial skills.
The competition, the Accelerate
Michigan Innovation Competition, is

the world's largest business competition
and aims to engage the state's college
students and business community. The
competition is in its second year and
offers a $25,000 grand prize.
Lauren Bigelow, executive director
of the Accelerate Michigan Innovation
Competition, described the program
as "an idea competition" that gives stu-
dents the opportunity to consider what
they would do if they had their own
businesses.
"We're just looking for students to
come together (and) see what creative
ideas they've got out there," Bigelow said.
Four students from the Ross School

of Business - Hunt Briggs, Paul Davis,
Robert Levine and Nolan Orfield - won
last year's grand prize in student catego-
ry with their proposal to have grocery
stores convert their waste products into
energy that could be used to power their
facilities.
Beyond the cash prize, the competi-
tion is mainly designed to bringstudents
into contact with members of the busi-
ness community and "link students with
mentors and coaches and folks in their
immediate vicinity," Bigelow said.
"We really want to keep bright stu-
dents in Michigan, so a lot of this is about
how can we get the student population

engaged with the business community,
(and) how people can get in touch with
different corporations," she said.
The competition also connects stu-
dents with major local businesses and
corporations, Bigelow added. The 25
semifinalists will get the opportunity
to meet with representatives from Dow
Corning, DTE Energy and Ford Motor
Company.
Students who are interested in partic-
ipating in the competition are required
to be enrolled in at least two classes at a
university within the state of Michigan.
To apply, students must submit a one-
page description of their business pro-

posal by Sept.30.
Each proposal will be assessed on the
basis of its clarity of presentation, cre-
ative innovation, intended market and
ideas that will have a broad impact.
"(It's) really worth the opportunity
because (semifinalists) get a chance to
rub elbows with large investment firms
(and) large corporates in a setting that
would really set them apart and really
give them a leg up in terms of intern-
ships and career possibility," Bigelow
said. "And in today's job market, that's
just incredibly valuable."
The competition is part of the New

NEWS BRIEFS
LANSING, Mich.
Michigan State,
Wayne State may
lose state funds
A Republican lawmaker is
sponsoring a bill that would strip
Michigan State University and
Wayne State University of some
state aid.
Rep. Bob Genetski of Saugatuck
says the proposal was introduced
recentlybecause some lawmakers
don't think the universities com-
plied with the intent of a require-
ment aimed at keeping tuition
increases below 7.1 percent for the
2011-12 academic year.
State budget director John
Nixon ruled earlier this year that
the universities were in "tech-
nical compliance" with tuition
restraint provisions. But there
were differing interpretations
of how the academic year was
defined and how tuition increases
were calculated.
Michigan State has about $18
million at risk with the new mea-
sure. Wayne State would lose
about $13 million.
Both universities have said
they're in compliance with the
law.

Illinois launches
Asian carp anti-
hunger program
Minced Asian carp tacos? How
about spaghetti with carp sauce?
Illinois officials hope serving
the invasive species on a plate is
the creative solution to two big
problems: controlling the plank-
ton-gobbling carp from enter-
ing the Great Lakes and record
numbers of people facing hunger.
But the idea has major obstacles,
mainly overcoming people's nose-
crinklingresponse to eating a fish
that grows to 100 pounds and is
able to sail out of the water - a
trait spotlighted in YouTube vid-
eos.
"We are in unchartered water
here," said Illinois Department
of Natural Resources spokesman
Chris McCloud. "Why remove
them and put them into a landfill
when you can take them and use
them for good? If we can get past
the name 'carp' and the percep-
tion ... we can prove this is going
to be a highly nutritious, cheap
meal."
HAVANA
Swimmer plans to
attempt Cuba to
Florida swim again
Cuban authorities said yester-
day that American Diana Nyad
plans to take another shot at what
would be a record swim from
Cuba to Florida after falling short
of her goal last month.
An email from Cuban press
officials invited journalists to an
encounter with the famed endur-

ance swimmer today at a marina
in Havana.
"Diana Nyad will offer a news
conference before once again
beginning to swim across the
Florida Straits between Havana
and Key West, in continuation of
the attempt realized on Aug. 7,"
the invitation read.
BERLIN
Pope talks ethics
in German speech
Pope Benedict XVI addressed
Germany's parliament in the
historic Reichstag building
yesterday, warning that politi-
cians must not sacrifice ethics
for power and evoking the Nazi
excesses of his homeland as a les-
son in history.
Amid scattered protests out-
side and a boycott by some law-
makers, Benedict began his first
state visit to Germany in a bid to
stem the tide of Catholics leaving
the church while acknowledging
the damage caused by the clerical
sex abuse scandal.
The pope spoke for 20 min-
utes in the Reichstag, which was
torched in 1933 in an incident
used by Hitler to strengthen his
grip on power.

talks break down

U.N. headquarters yesterday.

Two sides still
disagree over key
financial issues
DETROIT (AP) - Negotia-
tions over a new four-year con-
tract between Chrysler and the
United Auto Workers have bro-
ken down as both sides refuse
to budge on key financial issues,
two people briefed on the bar-
gaining said yesterday.
The talks ended late Wednes-
day in a dispute over the num-
ber of workers who are paid an
entry-level wage, said the peo-
ple, who asked not to be identi-
fied because the negotiations
are private.
Chrysler Group LLC, which
is losing money, wants no limit
on cheaper entry-level workers.
The union wants a cap on the
number of those workers, who
make $14 to $16 an hour, about
half of what a longtime union
employee earns.
"There was a line drawn in
the sand," one of the people
said. "Somebody's going to have
to give."
Chrysler factories continue
to operate under a contract
extension.
Detroit's three carmak-
ers are each negotiating labor
agreements with the UAW,
which represents 113,000 work-
ers at the companies. The new
contracts would be the first
since two of the automakers -
GM and Chrysler - nearly col-
lapsed during the recession and
needed government bailouts
in 2009. Ford Motor Co. didn't
need a bailout but took billions
in private loans to survive.
GM and the union agreed to
a tentative contract last week.
Chrysler was expected to be the
second Detroit automaker to
reach a deal.
Instead, Chrysler and UAW
negotiating teams were sent
home after the talks resulted
in a stalemate. The union said
it will now focus on talks with
Ford. No more bargaining with
Chrysler is scheduled.

The company is against any
limit on entry-level workers
because it would raise labor
costs. About 12 percent of
Chrysler's 23,000 factory work-
ers now are paid the lower wage
and the carmaker plans to hire
thousands more over the next
four years as it retools factories
to make new models.
The union, on the other
hand, wants a deal similar to
what GM agreed to - a 25 per-
cent cap on the number mak-
ing entry-level pay by the end
of 2015, the people said. Then,
entry-level workers would have
a chance to make higher pay, a
key issue for the union. Long-
time workers earn about $29 an
hour.
Chrysler has more entry-
level workers than GM or Ford,
and as a result, its hourly labor
costs are the lowest of the
Detroit companies.
The union agreed to a lower
tier of wages in 2007 to help
Detroit's carmakers survive
financial troubles, and to avoid
pay cuts for veteran workers.
Besides setting wages at
General Motors Co., Ford and
Chrysler, the contracts influ-
ence pay at U.S. factories run by
foreign carmakers, auto parts
makers and other manufactur-
ers.
Before talks broke up,
Chrysler and union negotia-
tors extended their current
contract. That extension lasts
another month.
Negotiators at Chrysler have
settled all non-economic issues
and were nearing an agreement
before the stalemate, the people
said. UAW President Bob King
was involved in the talks when
they broke down, one of the
people said.
UAW spokeswoman Michele
Martin would not comment.
Talks with Chrysler already
were strained before the break-
down. Last week, CEO Sergio
Marchionne sent a letter to
King accusing him of failing
to show up to complete nego-
tiations as scheduled. King
wouldn't discuss the letter.

Diplomats from
30 countries walk
out during Iran
president's talk
UNITED NATIONS (AP)
- American diplomats led a
walkout at the U.N. General
Assembly yesterday as Iran's
President Mahmoud Ahma-
dinejad fiercely attacked the
United States and major West
European nations as "arrogant
powers" ruled by greed and
eager for military adventurism.
The two U.S. diplomats, who
specialize in the Middle East,
were followed out of the cham-
ber by diplomats from more than
30 countries. They included the
27 European Union members,
Australia, New Zealand, Soma-
lia, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San
Marino and Macedonia, a U.N.
diplomat said. Israel boycotted
the speech.
Ahmadenijad's fiery anti-

U.S. and anti-Israeli rhetoric
has been a staple of the General
Assembly's ministerial meet-
ings.
Last year, Ahmadinejad pro-
voked a walkout by the U.S.,
EU, and others when he said a
majority of people in the United
States and around the world
believe the American govern-
ment staged the Sept. 11, 2001
terror attacks in an attempt to
assure Israel's survival.
The provocative comments
prompted the U.S. delegation to
walk out of Ahmadinejad's U.N.
speech, where he also blamed
the U.S. as the power behind
U.N. Security Council sanc-
tions against Iran for its refusal
to halt uranium enrichment, a
technology that can be used as
fuel for electricity generation or
to build nuclear weapons.
Ahmadinejad's speech pit-
ted the poverty and unhappi-
ness of most countries against
the riches and power of the U.S.
and unnamed European nations
that he accused of perpetuating

wars, causing the current global
economic crisis and infringing
on "the rights and sovereignty
of nations."
He attacked the United States
and European colonial powers
for abducting tens of millions
of Africans and making them
slaves, for their readiness "to
drop thousands of bombs on
other countries," and for domi-
nating the U.N. Security Coun-
cil He singled out the U.S. for
using a nuclear bomb against
Japan in World War II and
imposing and supporting mili-
tary dictatorships and totalitar-
ian regimes in Asia, Africa and
Latin America.
"It is as lucid as daylight that
the same slave masters and colo-
nial powers that once instigated
the two world wars have caused
widespread misery and disorder
with far-reaching effects across
the globe since then," Ahma-
dinejad said. "Do these arrogant
powers really have the compe-
tence and ability to run or gov-
ern the world?"

Adm. Mullen blames Pakistan for assault on U.S. Embassy

Complaint made
at International
Criminal Court
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
top U.S. military officer yester-
day accused Pakistan's powerful
intelligence agency of backing
extremists in planning and exe-
cuting the assault on the U.S.
Embassy in Afghanistan last
week and a truck bomb attack
that wounded 77 American sol-
diers days earlier.
In his last congressional tes-
timony before he retires next
week, Adm. Mike Mullen, chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
insisted that the Haqqani insur-
gent network "acts as a veritable
arm" of Pakistan's Inter-Servic-
es Intelligence agency, under-
mining the uneasy U.S.-Pakistan
relationship forged in the terror
fight and endangering American
troops in the nearly 10-year-old
war in Afghanistan.
Pakistan is "exporting vio-
lence" and threatening any suc-
cess in Afghanistan, Mullen said.

"In choosing to use violent
extremism as an instrument of
policy, the government of Paki-
stan, and most especially the
Pakistani army and ISI, jeop-
ardizes not only the prospect
of our strategic partnership but
Pakistan's opportunity to be a
respected nation with legitimate
regional influence," Mullen said.
"They may believe that by using
these proxies, they are hedg-
ing their bets or redressing
what they feel is an imbal-
ance in regional power. But
in reality, they have already
lost that bet."
Mullen's harsh words
marked the first time an
American official had direct-
ly tied Pakistan's intelligence
agency to the attacks and sig-
naled a significant shift in the
U.S. approach to Islamabad.
In the past, U.S. criticism of
Pakistan largely had been
relayed in private conver-
sations with the countries'
leaders while American offi-
cials publicly offered encour-
aging words for Islamabad's
participation in the terror

fight.
In recent days, U.S. officials
have been explicit in linking the
government to extremists who
are attacking American forces
in Afghanistan.
"With ISI support, Haqqani
operatives plan and conducted
that truck bomb attack, as well
as the assault on our embassy,"
Mullen told the Senate Armed

Services Committee.
He also said the United States
had credible information that
Haqqani extremists, with help
from the Pakistani intelligence
agency, were responsible for the
June 28 attack on the Inter-Con-
tinental Hotel in Kabul and other
small but effective assaults.
The Joint Chiefs chairman has
nurtured ties with the Pakistan-

is, meeting with officials more
than two dozen times, including
a 2 1/2-hour session last week in
Spain with his Pakistani coun-
terpart, Army Chief Gen. Ashfaq
Pervez Kayani.
Mullen reaffirmed his support
for continued U.S. engagement
with the nuclear-armed Pakistan
and warned of the consequences

Transportation troubles Redefining 'education reform'

Bing and DDOT need to end bus system delays
The city of Detroit has recently added public transportation
woes to its litany of struggles. Tensions between Detroit
Department of Transportation mechanics and Mayor Dave
Bing's administration have made bus travel a nightmare. City bus
mechanics claim they've been given too much work to complete in a
timely manner, and Bing's administration claims that the mechanics,
in response to recent pay cuts, aren't doing their jobs properly.
Regardless of who is at fault, the delayed bus service is keeping many
Detroit residents from traveling around the city. The issue needs to
be promptly and effectively addressed.

The DDOT budget has been cut from $80
million in 2008 down to its current level of $53
million. Today, the department has 130 fewer
buses than it did in 2008. The city claims
these funds remain more than sufficient to
cover the current maintenance cost of Detroit
buses. However, Leamon Wilson, president of
the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees Local 312 - which sup-
ports the mechanics - has claimed the funds
are in fact insufficient. Coupled with cuts in
overtime pay and a smaller staff due to retire-
ments, DDOT mechanics cannot efficiently do
their jobs. The city must allot the mechanics
proper time to fully complete each repair.
Bing has accused the union of retaliat-
ing to cuts in pay by delaying the bus main-
tenance process. Terrence King, Bing's top
transportation official, told protesters that the
union is attempting to take the city hostage.
While DDOT mechanics are entitled to a fair
wage, it's imperative that they do their jobs.
If mechanics are concerned about their com-
pensation they need to negotiate for better pay
through the proper channels, while continu-
ing to do their jobs.
While both parties claimed to have been

wronged in this scenario, Detroit residents
are the people who are truly suffering. Many
people use the bus system for transportation
to work, and bus transportation is the only
option for many students and residents. Lines
for the bus that wrap around city blocks are
unacceptable.
The situation has outraged residents and
warranted protests during a hearing at Detroit
City Hall last Friday. It's important for the
issue to be properly fleshed out, but the fin-
ger-pointing and blaming is counterproduc-
tive. DDOT and Bing's administration need
to resolve the issue quickly. Detroit citizens
have the right to rely on public transportation
to meet their needs and get them where they
need to go in a timely manner.
No matter who is right or wrong in this sce-
nario, the people who ultimately lose are the
residents of Detroit. The mayor's office needs
to investigate if the mechanics' complaints are
justified, and the mechanics need to perform
their duties correctly. The city and the union
both need to work together to end the bicker-
ing and find a solution to the problem. Improv-
ing the public transportation system will help
Detroit on its road to recovery.

When I spoke with a friend
about my idea to engage
undergraduates - she
among them,
ideally - in a
project of inno-
vating education,
she said she had
some ideas, but
education reform
wasn't her call-
ing. Though I IBBY
countered thatL
people can work ASHTON
toward some-
thing without
being "called" to it (whatever that
means), I understood why she feltthe
urge to resist making a commitment
to a movement she wasn't sure was
her own. With countless avenues for
change on this campus and the world
at large, it's natural to want to shield
yourself from overextension.
But I think her indifference about
her involvement in bettering schools
can be attributed to more than an
already full plate. The first problem, I
think, is the term "education reform"
itself, which sounds dated and (at
least for me) has an association with
aggressively touted but ultimately
unsuccessful policy initiatives. It
doesn't effectively name what is
essentially the civil rights movement
of our generation.
Much social inequity stems from
inequities in the education sys-
tem, and any vision of eradicating
inequality relies on the education
system for its success. So any prog-
ress we make in terms of social jus-
tice over the next 50 years will be
directly linked to the success and
progression of our schools. And the
work being done to achieve edu-
cational equality is on behalf of
technology innovation, community
partnership and even psychology
- not just curriculum development
and legislation.
A nine-page article in The New

York Times last week .asked, "What
if the Secret to Success is Failure?"
The writer, Paul Tough, explores the
relationship between schooling and
success by looking at the pedagogi-
cal priorities of Dominic Randolph,
the headmaster of Riverdale Coun-
try School in the Bronx, and David
Levin, who co-founded the famously
successful KIPP charter schools in
New York City. Though the contexts
of their work differ - Riverdale
being a socioeconomically privileged
private school and KIPP being a set
of charter schools with primarily
low-income students - the two lead-
ers met due to their shared interest in
psychology and schooling.
They both know how to foster
immediate quantitative academic
success among their students, but
they were after something else -
something that might lead to a sus-
tained, qualitative kind of success.
With help from the work of Univer-
sity psychology Prof. Christopher
Peterson, Randolph and Levin have
identified a list of seven character
traits that accurately predict "life
satisfaction and high achievement."
These seven are: zest, grit, self-con-
trol, social intelligence, gratitude,
optimism and curiosity. Instilling
these character strengths in young
people could become the goal of an
academic program.
To see two leaders, serving two
very different communities, trying to
figure out the best way to guarantee
a life of happiness for their students
is indicative of something more than
reform. It suggests a ripeness for a
wholly new way of thinking about
the purpose of school, the function of
teachers and the measure of achieve-
ment,bothduringand afteracademic
life. If the responsibility of an educa-
tion system is to strengthen charac-
ter, the perspective and expertise of
any self-reflexive person has value
when determining how to execute
such a system. Reforming, or rather

transforming, the education system
isn't a job to be left only to teachers,
administrators and policy makers.
And, at the collegiate level, it's not
a movement exclusive to education
majors and the handful of students
who were bittenby the documentary
"Waiting for Superman."
Because education is a system of
which we're all a product, we can
acknowledge our expertise of our
own experiences and contribute
valuable insight to the design pro-
cesses of Randolph, Levin and their
colleagues. And because a trans-
formed education system in the
21st century will likely breach the
walls of the classroom - existing
online and among the community
- it's more relevant to those who
aren't explicitly interested in how
schools operate. You don't have to
be an "education nerd" to be a part
of the movement - you just have to
be willing to think about questions
like, "What does it mean to be suc-
cessful?" and "How would I culti-
vate success systemically?"
People can't be
indifferent about
bettering schools.
This movement doesn't have to be
your calling or your career in order
for you to join. It just has to spark
your grit, optimism and curiosity
enough to make you position your-
self as an allied community mem-
ber. No matter what you study, take
interest in or plan to pursue profes-
sionally, there's space for you to cre-
ate the change that will define our
generation.

Affirmative action should
be based on income, not race
TO THE DAILY:
The Michigan Daily's editorial (Re-
affirm(ative action), 9/15/2011) argues that
Proposition 2 violates the 14th Amendment's
Equal Protection clause, and your support for
this claim is that race "plays a role in an appli-
cant's life." But there are many things that
play a role in an applicant's life that are not
considered in admissions decisions including
sexual orientation, parents' divorce, etc. A
stronger argument would show that race not
only plays a role in life but that this role war-
rants it special consideration for admissions
decisions.
One might argue that race warrants special
consideration because certain races are dis-
criminated against socially. However, in my
experience, a homosexual or obese applicant
is as likely to have been discriminated against
in a way that might affect high school perfor-
mance similar to a minority applicant. Unless
one thinks otherwise, admissions committees
should not consider race without also consid-
The repeal of 'don't ask,
don't tell' isjust the first step

ering other social factors.
A more compelling argument is that race
warrants special consideration because of
the enormous gaps in income and (especially)
wealth between the races. An applicant from
Flint, Mich.who has had poor housingschool-
ing and nutrition is certainly at a disadvantage
compared to an applicant from Grosse Pointe,
Mich. who has had private tutoring for the
SAT. This disadvantage should be considered
in admissions decisions. But the Flint appli-
cant is not disadvantaged primarily because
of her race, but because of her low wealth.
Affirmative action based not on race but on
economic status would solve many problems.
It would reduce racial tension. It would treat
an impecunious white applicant from Flint
and a wealthy black applicant from Grosse
Pointe more equitably. The goal of increased
racial diversity would be achieved, since
non-whites are disproportionately from low-
income communities. Employing this type
of affirmative action would simultaneously
achieve the diversity and equity that both
sides of the debate desire.

College is often the time in people's lives when their
political views start to form, if not solidify. As I'm sure
you all saw this year at Festifall, the University is filled
with a wide variety of clubs geared toward increasing
political participation and activism. Many of them,
however, reflect what seems to be the dominant ideol-
ogy here in Ann Arbor: liberalism. But if you are a con-
servative, a centrist or somewhere in between, fear not
because there is a place for you. You just need to know
where to look.
As you begin looking for your political niche on cam-
pus, you should exercise a bit of caution in your search.
Many political organizations on campus are rigidly ori-
ented toward a particular side of an issue or a certain
ideology. I know how tempting it is to surround yourself
with individuals just like you, but to only hang around
people who think like you do would be a terrible dis-
service to your University experience. Doing so will
amount to nothing more than joining partisan pep rat-
lies that punish dissenters and celebrate uniformity.
Your experience here should not be an extension of
your high school years. If, like me, you come from an
upper-middle-class town where diversity of thought
and political ideology is left something to be desired,
then it's time for you to experience something new.
Many students fail to realize that living in such a town
doesn't expose you to experience that could potentially
shed new light on certain issues. But college is all about
getting outside of your comfort zone, experiencing new
things and learning from a student body whose diverse
set of ideas and experiences are supposed to enrich
your education. It's all right if you disagree with peo-
ple around you. That's to be expected. But if you never
at least listen to the other side, you'll never be fully
informed on the issues of the day. Don't take lessons
from Washington D.C. It's OK ifsome tenets of the other
party don't appeal to you. You will never be judged here

for hearing out the other side. And if, God forbid, you
begin to agree with views that once seemed so contrary
to your own, that's OK too. Don't be afraid to change
your views. Nobody here will burn you in effigy or call
you a flip-flopper. I promise.
Now let me be clear: I'm not saying you should feel
the need to conform to those around you. No matter
how odd or out of the mainstream your views may be,
you can definitely find a place on campus where your
ideas will be welcomed and embraced. And as a member
of the Michigan Political Union, Ican unequivocally say
that MPU is one such place. This nonpartisan forum for
debate has defined my political experiences in college.
Between the three parties in the Union, Ican guarantee
your political views will be represented adequately. At
MPU, we aren't afraid to debate the hot topics such as
illegal immigration and affirmative action. And if you're
dying to hear what your professors and other experts
have to say about a particular issue, MPU often invites
them to add their own insights as well. We not only wel-
come dissent, we encourage and expect it.
Maybe if we had more opportunities to have an open
and civil discourse on the problems we face as a nation,
we could face those challenges without the bickering
and character attacks that have become all too common
in American politics. We could finally have that adult
conversation that so many in Washington have been
yearning for.
As a leader of the Independent Party, I invite you to
check out the Michigan Political Union as we would be
happy to have you join us. You can check us out online
at www.michiganpoliticalunion.com. And even if MPU
isn't the right club for you, I hope you'll continue to seek
out places on campus where you can share your views
but also listen to others as well.
Matthew Skiba is an LSA sophomore.

VIGIL
From Page 1
their testimony, alleging that
the police coerced them into
testifying against Davis. Mul-
tiple public figures, including
Pope Benedict XVI and former
President Jimmy Carter, have
also expressed doubt about the
verdict.
"We are in a judicial system
where you are innocent until
proven guilty," Brown said. "But

he had to prove his innocence."
Michael Dalton, assistant sec-
retary of the University's chap-
ter of the NAACP, said the event
was important for campus unity.
"As a people we need to come
together more often," Dalton
said. "Regardless of skin color,
we are all one people."
Brown said the event was
organized on the "spur of the
moment," but she said she was
pleased with the event. She
added that she said she hopes
the vigil will raise awareness

about a judicial system that is
"deeply flawed."
If only one person's opinion
about the judicial system and
the death penalty changed as
a result of the vigil, it would be
a success, Brown said. Brown
also stressed the importance of
action among students instead
of just talking about the Davis
case.
"You made your Twitter sta-
tus about (the Troy Davis case),
but nowlet's do somethingabout
it," Brown said.


MARS
From Page 1
Martinez, who is a research fel-
low inthe AOSS department, said
brine - a liquid combination of
water and highly concentrated
salt - could exist in Mars's envi-
ronment because of its unique
anti-freeze properties.
"Brines make the freezing
point of water drop," Martinez
said. "It's like when we add salt to
streets to melt snow."
Elliot is currently designing
the experimental chamber where
Mars-like conditions will be rep-
licated. The researchers plan to
create a chamber with tempera-
tures as low as -120 degrees Cel-
sius and extremely low pressures,
using the same Martian soil com-
position found in the Phoenix

landingsite, Elliot said.
Though Renno said he is- con-
fident his team will be able to
replicate brine in Mars-like con-
ditions, he said he is uncertain
about the success of the second
portion of his project, which is
to determine whether or not the
brines can sustain life.
He added that it is common for
brines to support life on Earth
in places such as deserts and dry
lakes.
"If you go to Death Valley,
there are dry lakes that have
brine water. There are shrimps,
called brine shrimps, that can
survive in these places," he said.
But Renno said examples of
life flourishing in brines on Earth
do not necessarily mean life can
exist in brines on Mars.
"On Earth, (microbes) would
be at much higher temperatures

than on Mars ... some of the salts
we found on Mars can be liquid
at -70 degrees Celsius. The chal-
lenge for us is finding microbes
that can survive in brines at
Mars-like temperatures," Renno
said.
But Elliot said even if the team
finds evidence that microbes
could survive in brines in Mars-
like conditions on Earth, it's a
"jump" to assume that microbes
actually exist on Mars. He added
that if the researchers discover
any evidence of microbes sur-
viving in brines in Mars-like
conditions, the finding would
potentially fuel a new generation
of space missions to Mars.
"We would need more rov-
ers, landers, more missions to
the polar regions. If you want to
find life on Mars, you need to go
there," Elliot said.

in previous years, according to
Zollweg.
"More freshmen were on
North Campus last fall than ever
before," Zollweg said.
The Go North! Initiative
started with the North Campus
vibrancy committee, comprised
of individuals from several enti-
ties of the University who came
together to discuss ways to
improve student life on North
Campus. Zollweg said the initia-
tive took into consideration stu-
dent criticism from a forum in
April called "The North Campus
Rant: The Good, The Bad, and
The Dude!" and used it to struc-
ture the initiative.
"From that qualitative feed-
back that we got from the stu-
dents, we kind of created these
subcommittees," Zollweg said.
"And each subcommittee is
charged with providing events
and outreach and programs."
The Go North! Initiative is
comprised of four subcommit-
tees - programming, communi-
cations and marketing, services
and transportation - that stu-
dents can get involved in.
This semester, Go North!
has organized many events to
kick off the initiative, including
UMix Rock the Night at Pier-
pont Commons, Blockbuster at
the Belltower in which movies

are shown on the North Campus
Diag, a meet-and-greet for Jew-
ish students hosted by the Uni-
versity of Michigan Hillel and a
Countdown to Kickoff: Field Day
event before the Notre Dame
football game.
Nick Smith, assistant director
for University Unions Arts & Pro-
grams and chair of the Go North!
programming subcommittee,
said the events and programs are
designed to be innovative and
exciting for students.
"The concept is really to pro-
vide 'wow' programming on
North Campus that's not only
awesome for this campus but
that's going to draw students
from Central to North," Smith
said. "Hopefully these opportu-
nities start to create an inherent
vibrancy or excitement to this
campus."
One of the events is Bonus Bus,
in which students answer trivia
questions about the University
and pop-culture and receive
prizes while on the bus to and
from North Campus.
"It's kind of like Go North!
take on Cash Cab," said Zollweg,
referring to the TV game show
that asks random cab riderstrivia
questions.
Some students stood in line
for a few hours in the parking
lot behind the Computer Sci-
ence and Engineering Building
- where the balloon lifted off. As
they waited an hour for the wind
to die down before the balloon

could safely launch, students
snacked on free cupcakes, pop-
sicles and bubble tea.
LSA sophomore Kathryn
Hohs, who heard about the hot
air balloon festival through a
University Twitter account, was
drawn to the event because she
wanted to take advantage of the
unique opportunity to ride in a
hot air balloon.
"I just thought it sounded real-
ly interesting because I've never
been in a hot air balloon and it's
kind of always been something I
wanted to do," Hohs said.
She added that she doesn't
frequently go to North Campus
and wouldn't have gone had
there not been the hot air bal-
loon event.
"Personally, this is only like
my second time on North Cam-
pus," Hohs said. "I never had
a reason to go last year, and I
never really wanted to take the
bus."
Engineering freshman James
Power, who lives in Bursley Resi-
dence Hall, said he thinks there
has been a lack of organized
activities on North Campus since
he arrived at the University, but
would welcome events in the
future since they would be con-
venient for him to attend.
"If they have fun events like
this, I'd definitely come because
it's hard to hike down to Central,"
Power said. "It would be nice to
have more stuff happening up
here."

making a production success-

makes the audience aware that
theater is a work in progress and
a collaboration of dedicated writ-
ers, directors, stage managers and
actors who make the production
possible.
Although the show is made up
of many students, the members
agree that their main concern is to
appeal to the entire audience.
"It is for people who haven't
seen a play in awhile, or ever, or
are thinking of joining," Kelley
said. "I want to encourage every-
one to get involved in theater and
the arts in Michigan."
He added: "I want people to

the most enjoyable thing one can

can give. It's a high priority to
me. I want the audience to enjoy
themselves and appreciate the fact
that although '24 Hour Theater' is
somethingthat is thrown together,
it has the potential to make people
think, laugh and enjoy theater."
If you like your entertainment
formal and crave perfection, "24

But there seems to be something
here to entertain everyone else.

shows how a
festival should be
By EMMA GASE
Daily Music Editor
AUSTIN, Texas - When I
first walked through the gates
of Zilker Park last weekend
- home of Austin City Limits
Music Festival - I needed a
moment to marvel. I took a deep
breath of the 90-degree air and
gazed at Austin's skyline just
beyond the headliner stage,
wiggled my toes in the sump-
tuous green grass, noticed the
lawn chairs clumped around
trees and inhaled a tantalizing
scent of barbeque and Tex-Mex.
All I could think was: "This is
exactly what a music festival
should be like."
Last Friday afternoon, raspy
and soulful as ever, Ray LaMon-
tagne's mellow set was a nice
amuse-bouche to the festival.
Chart-toppers Foster the People
played an energetic show, closing
out with a killer techno-dubby
version of "Pumped Up Kicks"
and a dramatic stage dive. Once
the sun went down, however,
a schism was revealed among
ACL-goers: Those Who Went to
Coldplay and Those Who Have
Taste. I was the latter.
There's nothing quite like
witnessing thousands of heads
simultaneously turn to the sky,
hands throwing diamonds in
the air as Kanye West descends
like Zeus with "Can we get
much higher?" booming, while
a dozen furry-clad dancers
writhe primordially around on
stage. OK, so maybe it wasn't

Arcade Fire headlined Austin City Limits on Sunday.


exactly a huge surprise for
those of us who live-streamed
his Coachella performance in
April instead of studying for
finals, but seeing it on a tiny
YouTube screen really doesn't
do it justice.
Boxing out for Kanye meant
sacrifices - no Mavis Staples,
no Santigold, no beer and no
bathroom breaks. We endured
an entire hour of Nas and
Damian Marley spazzing out to
a weird conglomeration of reg-
gae and hip hop beforehand.
But being 15 to 20 people back
from the front row was worth
every bruise, elbowed rib and
flat-tired sneaker.
While the show's setup was
nothing short of extravagant
(the forklift, a ridiculously trip-
py light show, ballet dancers, a
medieval-looking background,
an outfit change), Yeezy's mic
cut out for a good portion of
his verses of opener "Dark Fan-
tasy," and his voice was hoarse.
The "He's totally gonna bring
out Jay-Z!" hype-fest circu-
lating through the crowd was
crushed when West jokingly
started rapping from Watch the
Throne: " "Ye can we get mar-
ried at the maalll ... ' Just kid-
ding, just kidding, wait for the
tour yall,"kto loud groans from
all.
On Saturday, Gillian Welch
and Dave Rawlings's arrivalwas
delayed a half-hour due to Skril-
lex's dubstep banger only one
stage away. When Welch finally
took the stage with Skrillex's
weird, squelching techno still
audible, she quipped, "Well, I
wasn't expecting the Martian
landing next to us, but I guess
we'll do what we can." The mar-
ried couple's rootsy, backcoun-
try harmonies and Rawlings's
absurdly talented guitar play-
ing made their show nothing
short of transcendent. No other
point in the festival provided
such intimacy between artist
and audience.
Saturday night presented a
conundrum: Is it worth it to
see a headliner - specifically

, .- ~ .

a legend like Stevie Wonder
- even if the sound quality is
poor, your view obstructed,
the crowd unnavigable and the
sound from My Morning Jacket
bleeding over so clearly as tobe
able to discern what song they
were playing? It was tough, but
we decided to cut our losses and
head over to Jim James and Co.
a few songs into Stevie. Luck-
ily, we arrived just as the band
launched into a face-melting
version of "Mahgeeta" that
saved the night.
"Let's get rowdy, this is
motherfucking Texas!" cried
Ryan Bingham of Ryan Bing-
ham and the Dead Horses on
Sunday afternoon. Maybe it was
because it was hot as hell, or
because there was a fiddle play-
er onstage, or maybe I was just
delirious from the heat - but
for the first time all weekend, I
felt like I was in Texas, dammit
- and I was feelin' it. Bingham's
gravelly voice, Southern twang,
distorted guitars and fiddle eas-
ily made him ACL's ideal act.
You never would have
guessed by the crowd that
Arcade Fire was the headliner
of Austin City Limits. Con-
sidering the band was the last
show, performing unopposed,
Grammy-album-winner-of-
the-year and a former Coach-
ella headliner, the audience
was kind of a buzzkill. Call me
naive, but I was expecting some
earth-shattering sing-along
action during "Wake-Up," and
all I got were some lukewarm
"Aaahs" from about every third
person.
As I made the 20-minute
uphill trek back to my car on
Sunday night to rally for the
three-hour drive back to my
house in Houston, I wasn't
thinking about my painful sun-
burn, my ruined sneakers, that
I was covered in probably a
dozen other people's sweat or
even that my hair was begin-
ning to dred itself - the only
thing running through my
mind was this: I need to move
to Austin one day.

BEHIND THE SCENES
The business side of art

Students learn
there's no business
like show business
By ARIELLE SPECINER
Daily Arts Writer
They say that if someone is
right-brained, he or she is more
of a creative thinker. If someone
is left-brained, he or she is more
logicalwhen reasoning. But some
students tackle problems with
both sides of the brain and start
their journey to an artistic career
on a less artistic pathway.
Though most might assume
students in the Ross School of
Business or College of Engineer-
ing would end up in math-heavy,
structural careers, there are
many students who would like to
engage in something a bit more
creative with their degrees.
Senior Kathryn Pamula is
working on her BBA from Ross as
well as a BA in Performance Arts
Management from the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance. She
hopes to one day be a company
manager for a Broadway show.
"I came into the University
kind of knowing that this is what
I wanted to do," Pamula said. "I
was poking around online and I
saw there was a career for people
who want to do theater but want
FILM REVIEW

to do management stuff."
This is not an uncommon
career path at the University.
With prestigious schools such
as Ross, the School of MT&D
and the College of Engineering,
it's no coincidence students who
have such aspirations would
come here and blend the schools.
However, there are also those
who simply stumble into this mix
of programs.
"I can't picture myself sit-
ting at a desk and managing a
corporate budget - being one
of a million," said dual enrolled
Ross School of Business and LSA
junior Alex Schrader. "SoI decid-
ed one day that I'm going to try
something completely different. I
was getting bored of my classes."
After atrip to the theater with
her mother, Schrader decided to
sign up for MUSKET - and that
was the start of her interest in
theater arts.
Some students go the other
way around, like engineering and
MT&D student Charlotte Camp-
bell, who started out in a creative
setting but then didn't feel chal-
lenged enough and transitioned
to the technical side of theater.
"I get a lot of funny Jooks
when I tell people my double
major," Campbell said. "They're
like, 'Wait, how does that work?'
When I say sound engineering,
they sort of get it."

It makes sense that most peo-
ple wouldn't initially think cre-
ative careers need matter-of-fact
thinkers to propel the industry.
But after all, show business is a
business - there is a need for a
Wall Street brain on Broadway
Avenue. The University provides
an outlet for that.
"I think that there are a lot of
opportunities within the man-
agement field," Pamula said.
"That's one of the things I've
learned from being here. There
are a thousand different things
you can go into. You can go into
marketing, you can go into com-
pany managing, general manag-
ing or producing."
Though there isn't much
crossover between schools, these
students make the most of what
they have. By taking marketing,
strategy, logic design and other
out-of-the-box classes, students
with creative business aspira-
tions are able to overlap their
schedules to learn skills for both
degrees.
"You do have to wear hats. I
have to go to the business school
and put my business hat on,"
Pamula said. "The theater stuff is
definitely a creative outlet. There
have been some classes in Ross
where it's good to have a little
creativity - but I'm not going
to write a play about my finance
classes."

Campbell explained how her
theater skills helped her excel
in her engineering classes - not
because of the content she was
learning, but through the people
skills she learned from it.
"It's the study of people,
bringing other people to life
through stories," she said of the-
ater. "I like to think that I can
bring a lot of that teamwork into
engineering."
Other ventures prepare these
students for their real-world
careers, too - not just classroom
time. Both Schrader and Pamula
landed internships in the theater,
though they have business back-
grounds. University clubs like
MUSKET and Basement Arts
also prepare them for real world
experiences.
"I think it's a learning pro-
cess," Schrader said. "Not every-
thing in the theater you learn in
the classroom, you just have to do
it. I learned a ton from MUSKET
last year that I never thought I
would learn."
Making it in show business,
or any creative career, is diffi-
cult. Fortunately, these students
have the advantage of a business
or engineering degree that they
can fall back on in case the artsy
maneuver falls through.
"I have an option for myself,"
Campbell said. "There's a whole
myriad of opportunities."

Kasabian is sad today.

new 'Velociraptor!'


'Straw Dogs' remake has no bite

By TIMOTHY RABB
DailyArts Writer
Plenty of remakes, like "Scar-
face," "The Departed" and
"Ocean's 11," hit the bulls-eye,
and plenty
more fall short.
And then
there's the $traW DOgS

of touch with and Rave
its roots, it sets
a new standard. Screen Gems
The remake of
"Straw Dogs" is one such trav-
esty - unfaithful to its source
material, unjustly stereotypical
and offensive on multiple lev-
els. For those who haven't seen
director Sam Peckinpah's origi-
nal, Rod Lurie's interpretation
will come off as more of the usual
fly-by-night Hollywood schlock,
albeit more shocking and violent
than most. But if you remember
Dustin Hoffman's hair-raising
metamorphosis from timid
pacifist to cold-hearted killer,
this reimagining of Lurie's -
stripped of all substance - is a
film that simply shouldn't be.
The original was purpose-
ful, intended as a metaphor for
the effects of the Vietnam War
on society. Leading good guy
David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman,
"Stranger than Fiction") brutally
massacres his home's would-be
invaders to protect the mentally
disabled Henry Niles from their
bloody vengeance, then he drives
Niles into town. Niles turns to
Sumner and remarks, "I don't
know my way home." Sumner
smiles and turns to meet Niles's
gaze, reassuring him, "It's OK,

But none of

from Kasa- Columbia
bian's fourth
effort, which
takes more than a few strides
from 2009's West Ryder Pauper
Lunatic Asylum. The British out-
fit has always toed, with finesse,
the fine tightrope line between
indie and hard rock. But with
the advent of Velociraptor!, that
line has been blurred to obscu-
rity.
Despite taking its name from
Charles Manson's female get-
away driver, Kasabian draws
some influence from a couple
of fairly conventional bands.
"Let's Roll Just Like We Used
To," the first track on Velocirap-
tor!, begins with the combina-
tion of a lone horn and creepy
background vocals, but eventu-
ally settles into traditional form
- it could easily double as a
modified hit off the latest Muse
release. "Re-wired," in all likeli-
hood one of the best songs Kasa-
bian has put out, has a shade of
that cool British disdain that is
oh-so-inherent to bands like the
Arctic Monkeys, among oth-
ers. The key here is that while
the record does borrow some
sounds, it's wholly distinguish-
able as an entirely separate
work, making it well rounded
instead of plagiaristic.
Velociraptor! also fortunately
runs into one of the rare ben-
eficial accidents of the music
industry. Well-received singles
are few and far between and are
infrequently overshadowed by
the rest of the album. However,
"Days Are Forgotten" is one of
those "perfect storms" where
not only is it the hit represen-
tative of the record, but it's not
even the best on it - the single
essentially leads listeners to a
wealth of great material. That

being said, "Days Are Forgot-
ten" engages a left-hook chorus
that will keep it a lasting fixture
on alternative radio stations in
the coming weeks.
Kasabian is also clearly
undaunted to showcase its dark-
er side. "Switchblade Smiles,"
which can be heard on the
upcoming "Fifa 12" soundtrack,
is all but a lock to be the second
single released. Beginning with
a deep, fuzzy bass riff, the song
switches to a few moments of
warbled vocals reminiscent of
an imam's call to prayer, before
the drums thunder in and the
already intense track picks up
even more. "I Hear Voices"
is less creepy than one might
expect from the title, but the
fluid guitar and fluctuating
synthesizer meet perfectly at
the chorus as frontman Tom
Meighan issues his countdown:
"One minute to, one minute to,
one minute to midnight!"
Dinosaurs have
never been
so bloody
British.
The Leicestershire locals
have always been known for
their grand, driving power-
rock anthems, and Velociraptor!
only gives them more occasion
to dial up the intensity. Aside
from "Goodbye Kiss" - an out-
of-place ballad with actual sen-
timentality - and a relatively
dead track in "Neon Noon," the
record is packed with bravado
and bold audacity. On the heels
of its last work being overshad-
owed by the death of Michael
Jackson, Kasabian has taken
advantage of its latest opportu-
nity to make a statement. The
band has issued the proclama-
tion that it will be heard and
that its name will be spoken
along with Muse and the Arc-
tic Monkeys as some of the best
that England currently has to
offer.

IkL

Michigan fifth-year
senior center David Molk
is well known for both
his fiery play on the field
and his contempt for the
media during press con-
ferences.
On Monday, when
fifth-year senior defen-
sive end Ryan Van Ber-
gen exited the press
conference, he explained
Molk's attitude rather
simply: "He just hates
people."
A few minutes later,
Molk had a chance to
defend himself with the
media. And he had a
strong showing, laugh-
ing andjoking more than
ever before:
Question: (Van Bergen) said
it's nothing personal against us.
David Molk: No, I don't actu-
ally hate you guys. I actually like
you guys.
Q: When did that change?
When you became captain?
Molk: When I had to.
I don't hate people. I don't sit
at home like a hermit and just toil
about how much I hate the world.
That's not what I do.
Q: So there's no book coming
out?
Molk: No, there's not a book:
"Why David Molk Hates the
World."
Q: But you have to admit, the
last couple years you came out,
and there was a little tension at
these press conferences.
Molk: Sure, there's no doubt

about that, especially when you
guys ask bad questions.
Q: What's a bad question?
Molk: When you kept asking
about my injury. I hated that.
That's what turned me on you
guys.
Q: So you didn't have an inju-
ry?
Molk: I did, but you guys kept
asking me.
I probably shortcut you guys.
Q: Looking at the running
backs, is there something differ-
ent or unique that Vincent Smith
does?
Molk: They each have their
different style of running. They
approach each play in a differ-
ent way. It seemed like Vince
came out in the end and had some
pretty good runs, but again some
of that's how the offensive line
blocks - maybe we didn't do as
well at the beginning of the game
as we did at the end. It's just kind
of how the holes open up and who
hits them.
Q: Is he easier to block for
because he's rather short?
Molk: I don't think there's any
difference. It's more like it's easi-
er for him to hide from defenders.
Q: Despite his size, he's a pret-
ty tough guy, isn't he?
Molk: He's really tough. He
likes to hit, that's the weird thing
about him. As a little guy, you'd
think he'd shy away from it or cut-
block some guys to get away from
heavy contact. But he will seek
out and go find the biggest guy on
the defense and just nail him. I
love that about him.
Q: Do you remember the first

time you saw Vince go after the
biggest guy on the field?
Molk: He goes after the big
guys in practice all the time. You
usually see a running back take a
shortcut and cut a guy below the
knees, but he'll actually get down
and pop up and hit a guy right
below the chin. It's great.
Q: The first time it happened
in practice, did the guy even see
him?
Molk: No, you can't see him.
No one can see him.
Q: When you see Smith take on
bigger guys, what does that do for
you and the rest of the offense?
Molk: Usually you don't
see it until you watch the film,
because I'm going this way and
he's (behind me) somewhere. But
when you see that on film, when
you have a guy that's so under-
sized just manning up and taking
on anything that comes, it's really
good to see.
Q: How good is San Diego
State?
Molk: They're a good team, a
valuable opponent. They have a
very good defense. They really
have an interesting scheme on
defense that will be fun to see.
It's just a different scheme,
something that no one else does.
If you see it on film, you'll under-
stand why it's different.
Q: If you were facing Rich
Rodriguez, like San Diego State
is now facing their former coach,
how would you approach that?
Molk: I don't really know. I'm
sure it would be weird, but at the
same time, I respect what he did.
He made a decision, made a move

on his own decision. It's truly
becoming a business, and that's
what his career path took. I can't
fault a guy for doing that.
Q: How does this 3-0 start
feel different from similar starts
you've had the past two seasons?
Molk: It feels about the same.
We've just got to make sure we
maintain this level of play we're
at and improve as we get into Big
Ten season.
Obviously, we're happy for
three wins in a row, that's always
a good thing, having no losses.
At the same time, we're more in

Wolverine offense will push team past Aztecs

KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Editor
San Diego State is off to its first
3-0 start since 1981. The Aztecs
are amped up with the chance to
beat their former coach. Michigan
will be just as excited, hoping to
give Michigan coach Brady Hoke
a win against his former team.
Everybody is aware of the
coachingsituation - Hoke, offen-
sive coordinator Al Borges and
assistant coaches Dan Ferrigno,
Darrell Funk, Jeff Hecklinski
and Mark Smith all coached for
the Aztecs in 2009 and 2010. But
what about the players? Here's a
breakdown of Saturday's game:
Michigan pass offense vs. San
Diego State pass defense
Junior quarterback Denard
Robinson has had problems with
his consistency so far this sea-
son. Most of his troubles have
stemmed from footwork issues.
Robinson has been at his best
when he's on the move, not think-
ing, just reacting to whathe has to
work with. But that might bode
well for Robinson and the Wol-

verines - San Diego State fre-
quently blitzes and likes to put
pressure on the quarterback. The
Aztecs have recorded nine sacks
so far this year, good for 22nd in
the nation.
San Diego State is ranked 36th
in the nation in pass defense and
has allowed 186 yards in the air
per game. In a 42-24 win over
Washington State last week,
senior cornerback Larry Parker
recorded seven tackles, one forced
fumble and two interceptions.
Look for him tobe a big factor in
the Aztec secondary again this
week against the 68th-ranked
Michigan pass offense.
With Michigan still search-
ing for a lead running back and
with Hoke trying to limit Rob-
inson's carries after he tallied 26
last week, Robinson could have
a breakout performance in the
air against an average San Diego
State secondary.
Edge: Michigan
Michigan rush offense vs. San
Diego State rush defense
Hoke and Borges have said for
months that they'd like one fea-

ture running back to carry the
load. Week one, that back was
sophomore Fitzgerald Toussaint.
Week two, senior Michael Shaw.
Week three, Toussaint. Andnow it
appearsathat junior Vincent Smith,
who notched 118yards on just nine
carries against Eastern Michigan,
willgetthenod against theAztecs.
With so much uncertainty
at running back, Robinson has
continued to take the majority
of the carries for the Wolverines
- he has just eight fewer carries
than all of the backs combined -
exactly what Hoke didn't want.
Regardless, Robinson is still one
of the most elusive runners in the
nation and will no doubt cause
problems for the Aztecs. San
Diego State gives up 197 yards per
game, 98th in the nation.
Look for Robinson to find the
holes often on Sunday, and if
Smith and the rest of the running
back corps can get it going, it could
be along day forthe Aztec defense.
Edge: Michigan
San Diego State pass offense
vs. Michigan pass defense
The Michigan pass defense
is 26th in the nation and fourth
in the Big Ten. Not counting the
rain-shortened game against
Western Michigan, the Wolver-
ines have given up an average
of 172 yards in the air. That's an
improvement from last year's

passing defense which finished
last in the Big Ten.
But on Saturday, Michigan will
be facing a quarterback whom
Borges calls "the best we've faced
this year." And Borges would
know - he coached senior quar-
terback Ryan Lindley for two
years. Last week, after throw-
ing for 273 yards and two touch-
downs against Washington State,
Lindley became just the second
player in schoolhistory to pass for
more than 10,000 career yards.
He's also first in career touch-
downs with 74.
Lindley has connected with
sophomore receiver Colin Lock-
ett, a former defensive back, 12
times so far this year for a total of
254 yards. Lockett isn't the only
receiving threat, though - the
Aztecs have five receivers with
five receptions or more this sea-
son.
With Lindley under center and
a strong receiving corps, it might
be a little too much for a still
unproven Michigan pass defense.
Edge: San Diego State
San Diego State rush offense
vs. Michigan rush defense
Sophomore running back Ron-
nie Hillman is the Robin to Lind-
ley's Batman. It could even be
argued that Hillman takes the
title of Batman. He's a Heisman
Trophy candidate this year and

has already put up monstrous
numbers.
Hillman is second in the nation
in rushing yards per game with
166, and he's first in scoring per
game. Last week, he rushed 32
times for191yards and four touch-
downs; that's equal to the number
of touchdowns Michigan's run-
ning backs have, combined.
There are few defenses in the
country that have a legitimate
chance of stopping Hillman. The
Wolverines, who rank 103rd in
the nation in rushing defense and
give up an average of 202 yards
per game, can only hope to slow
him down.
Look for defensive coordinator
Greg Mattison to throw several
different kinds of defensive looks
and blitzes at the Aztecs to put the
brakes on Hillman. Don't expect
any ofthem to be effective.
Edge: San Diego State
Special Teams
Michigan freshman kicker
Matt Wile was going to be an
Aztec. But when Hoke left last
January, Wile followed him.
That leftsenior Abelardo Perez
with the kicking duties for the
Aztecs. But Perez is no slouch -
he received second-team Moun-
tain West Conference honors last
season after posting a league-best
28 touchbacks, and he finished
the season 17-for-22 on field goals,

including a career-long 53 yarder.
Senior punter Brian Stahovich
has been one of the nation's best
and is third in school history in
career punting yards.
Wile has yet to attempt a field
goal for the Wolverines, as red-
shirt sophomore Brendan Gib-
bons has been given the nod as
the field goal kicker. Wile has
taken control as a kick-off spe-
cialist, and he has also been the
Wolverines' punter in place of
the suspended sophomore Will
Hagerup. Gibbons is 1-for-1 on
the year, with a 21-yard chip shot
last week against Eastern Michi-
gan. But Gibbons and Wile both
remain unproven, snd until they
have a chance to prove they can
convert a field goal in important
situations, they'll almost always
lose this one.
Considering Perez and Stahov-
ich are one of the better kicker/
punter combos in college football,
this one's a no-brainer.
Edge: San Diego State
intangibles
This one will mean a lot to
Hoke, and he'll have his players
ready to go against his former
team. Not to mention, he and
several of his coaches know a lot
about the Aztecs.
Edge: Michigan
Final Score: Michigan 35, San
Diego State 24

In the next breath Brady had his arm around Glen, ask-
ing, "How's school? How's the family?"
Glen grew up off the field, under Brady's guidance. When
Glen got in trouble at night, he gave Brady a call. Sometimes
he called Brady at 2 a.m. just to leave him a message after a
night on the town.
Brady didn't like the late-night wake up calls, but this
is why he loves coaching at the college level. "At 18 to 23, I
know how I was," he says. He needed to learn the technique.
He needed to grow up.
Off the field they need a friend. On it, they need a father.
Maybe they just need Brady Hoke - his players play hard
for him because they love him; they play well because he
teaches them.
Now get really close, right next to Glen's shoulder. Brady's
there. He stopped practice because he doesn't like the way
Glen's playing.
Brady holds his index finger and thumb three inches
apart, holding an invisible golf tee on top of Glen's shoul-
der.
"See that?" Brady asks Glen. "You know who that is?
That's Freddy Soft. He's telling you it's OK, you don't have to
work hard today. You can take it easy today."
Brady could hear the other guys laughing.
"He knew that pissed me off," Glen says.
By Glen's fifth year, he always lined up across from the
opponent's best offensive lineman. Two future NFL stars,
Orlando Pace and Flozell Adams, were his biggest chal-
lenges.
Glen tallied five tackles and a sack against Adams and five
tackles and two sacks on Pace on his way to an All-America
season.
Now, Brady tells his players to watch Glen Steele film.
That is his legacy.
Glen looks down at what he's written on the white piece
of paper, reminding him what he needs to talk to his guys
about today. He folds and unfolds it, not staring at it for too
long because each bullet point conjures examples he'd like
to forget. It's his job to fix them and teach his guys.
He looks you in the eye when he talks to you, piercing and
demanding, you can't help but listen to what he has to say.
Gray hairs start to peak out from underneath his "Fort
Wayne Snider Football" hat. His beard is mostly dark hug-
ging his square jaw, but his eyes cast shadows. That's the
only sign Glen is 37-years old. Otherwise, he still looks like
he can play.
It's raining today, so they'll have to practice in the gym,
which is good and bad because he'll get to spend more
individual time with his nine varsity defensive linemen.
The list in his hand starts with the same four things he
writes on it before every practice:
1.Attitude
2. Consistent
3. Play with passion
4. Pad level
A few more notes are scribbled below - he won't let
anyone see what's written there. Those two points are
just between him and the starters he has to challenge
today.
He heads for the gym and runs into another assis-
tant coach, Bob Bergeron, in the empty locker room
- Bergeron's the former Michigan kicker that Brady
introduced Glen to, which led to Glen landing the job at
Snider.
Glen smiles as wide as he- can when he says "hi" to
Bergeron's little girl, who came to work today.
Glen almost had a little girl of his own. His eyes soften

and dart away when he talks about it.
Last October his first daughter was
born. She passed away in December
from congenital heart disease. He and
his wife still want two kids. They're
working on it, while Glen starts his
coaching career. He's also thinking
about going back to school to become a
teacher.
"When you're trying to start a family
and when you get up to that level, coach-
ing college football, there is no time. It
takes you away from your kids, espe-
cially your pivotal years that your father
should be there. Lord knows a woman
would have to be very understanding.
"But I also know what is more impor-
tant to me, and that's starting a family.
I can do that and still make a difference
at this level.
"It's about memories. When it's all
said and done it's our memories that
are there. We're all going to come and GLEN STEEL E
we'reall going to go; it's the memories
we leave behind." THE PROTEGE
Practice is about to start.
He has nine boys staring at him, not
daring to flinch, as he looks down again "THESE KIDSDOWN THE LINE, THEYBECOME
at that piece of paper.
These are the things Glen heard COACHERSAND THEY TEACH WHAT I TAUGHT THEM"

from Brady. Glen still calls Brady with
questions about how he should coach
certain kids. He called Brady about
Donte Bowen, a defensive tackle whose school shut down,
landing him in Glen's lap for his senior season.
Bowen's talented and has a lot of MAC schools looking
at him, but he doesn't know how to use his hands. He never
really was coached technique before. Brady tells Glen to
work with Bowen on his hands 20 minutes before and after
practice, like they used to do.
"First of all, how's everybody doing in school," Glen
starts.
Bowen says he's re-taking a test on Thursday. Another
defensive tackle, Weston Painter, smiles when he announc-
es he got a 66-out-of-66 on his history test.'
Then Glen looks them all in the eye at once.
He goes through each point on the list, and then starts
working on their six-inch power step.
"Take that step - boom, boom," he says, thrusting
his hands into the air, showing them how the wrong step
throws off balance.
When a kid makes a mistake, he stops the drill and dem-
onstrates what they did wrong and how to fix it.
His defensive ends get called to another station, so it's
just Glen and his tackles now.
He starts them on a new one-on-one drill, showing them
how to take on a moving guard with their hands, and still
maintain their gap assignments.
Painter steps in first. He's a 6-foot-2, 245-pound junior
but Glen still could swallow him whole. Painter's reps are
better than others but its still not where Glen wants them
to be.
"You're getting high and it kills you," Glen says, show-
ing him how low he needs to get. "Take everything you
have and throw it out the window because you're getting
high."
Painter isn't perfect again, his hands are too far out-
side and his pads are too high. Again, Glen shows Painter
where to put his hands, how to move his feet if the guard
runs inside. Painter steps in again.

This time, Glen sends the guard outside. Painter
doesn't even get his hands on the guy.
Glen's face gets red. He pulls Painter close.
"This week is going to determine if you're a starter or
not," Glen says, his voice rising. "Let's get it right and let's
get it going. You can do it."
Painter steps back in.
"Better, better." Glen says after his rep.
The period ends and the gym empties.
Glen puts his arm around Painter as they walk out. Glen
does most of the talking.
"What I saw lastyear on tape and what I see now are two
different people," Glen says. "You have to take it seriously.
Play with technique. Doit right this week."
Painter can't decide whether to stare at his shoes or look
straight ahead.
"Everything all right at home?" Glen asks. "School?"
Painter nods.
"Good," Glen says, patting his back.
It'll take many more instances, many more moments,
many more choices - Painter's going to have to live a bit
longer - before the kid truly understands what his name
means to him. Until then, Glen will have his arm around
him.
"It's amazing how much you really take from your coach-
es and make it into your coaching," Glen says now. "And
these kids down the line, they become coaches and they
teach what I taught them. It just keeps going and going and
going."
The same poem that Painter reads in Glen's playbook,
Glen read in Lloyd's, and Brady has in his at Michigan -
"The Man in the Glass," written by Dale Wimbrow in 1934.
The last stanza reads:
You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years.
Andget pats on the back as you pass,
But yourfinal reward will be the heartaches and tears
Ifyou've cheated the man in the glass.

Yes, Brady Hoke sent a mass text message saying goodbye to
his guys at San Diego State. Yes, Ryan Lindley can throw the ball
a mile. And yes, Al Borges may wish Ronnie Hillman was still
his lead back. And guess what? Michigan's ranked again after
beating up on a weak non-conference schedule and pulling a
miracle against Notre Dame. Do they deserve it? Maybe not. But
as Brady Hoke repeats over and over, "This is Michigan." And
Michigan means being consistently overrated before anything
happens in conference play.

Western Michigan (Sept. 3): Good thing the
rain came. And the blitzes, too. Looked like Greg
Robinson was coaching until the second quarter.
Notre Dame (Sept. 10): Nothing to see here.
Michigan rallied with a 28-point fourth quarter
to stun the Fighting Irish and get the victory.
Eastern Michigan (Sept. 17): After struggling
early, Michigan relied on the legs of Denard
Robinson and Vincent Smith for the 31-3 win.
San Diego State (Sept. 24): Hoke said it was
hard leaving his players behind at San Diego
State. They were mad he didn't say goodbye.
Minnesota (Oct.1): MarQueis Gray played wide
receiver last year - now he's the quarterback
and the only thing exciting about the Gophers.
Northwestern (Oct. 8): Dan Persa - that's
about it.

S Michigan State (Oct. 15): Edwin Baker and
Le'Veon Bell ran over and through Michigan last
year, and Kirk Cousins ain't too shabby either.
Little Brother's growing up.
Purdue (Oct. 29): Guard your ACLs! The knee
injury has plagued Purdue the past two seasons.
Quarterback Rob Henry was the latest victim.
Iowa (Nov. 5): The faces change, but it always
seems like Kirk Ferentz finds the same types of
players. This is just another solid Iowa team.
Illinois (Nov. 12): Nathan Scheelhaase-to-A.J.
Jenkins and Jason Ford is the whole offense.
Consider Scheelhaase a poor man's Denard.
Nebraska (Nov. 19): The legendary blackshirts
make their debut at the Big House. By the time
Jared Crick and Co. leave, it may get ugly for 'M.'
Ohio State (Nov. 26): No Tressell? No Pryor?
Ohio State's still deeper than Michigan, but a lot
could change by Thanksgiving.

"When you're a player, it's kind of like when you're ason
and you look up to your dad, you want people to like you,"
Marcus says. "You see someone get respect: you hear people
talking about Bo Schembechler, Lloyd Carr - class act. We
all want that too.
"How do I get the mud off my name? That's what I want-
ed Brady to do. And you see, that's what he was good at."
Brady was always honest, just like it was around the din-
ner table growing up. If Brady's dad had a problem with
someone, it would be discussed. "No one held back,"he says.
"If youtruly do care aboutpeople you have to communicate,
the good and the bad."
Brady pulled Marcus close.
Whatdoesyour name mean to you?
Brady said this all the time to his players, and after Mar-
cus's credit card incident and his teammate issues, he need-
ed to hear it again.
That's all you have - your reputation and your name. How
doyou want to be remembered? What doyou wantyour legacy
to be?
In some other words, Marcus heard the same message
echoing off the walls of Schembechler Hall.
"That's a straight Michigan slogan, man," Marcus says.
"(Gary) Moeller asked me the same question. Coach Schem-
becher asked me the same question. Lloyd and Brady asked
me the same question. Because they're all from the same
cloth, the same tree. That's how Michigan coaches were
goingto speak to their players."
Flash-forward to 1998, Marcus is sitting in Brady's office
again.
He listened the first time, cleaned up his name, and Mich-
igan won a National Championship in 1997. Marcus made
sure his bad name didn't spoil a memory he'd hold tight for
the rest of his life. That was his new legacy: National Cham-
pion.
Until trouble found him again that summer - Lloyd sus-
pended him the first six games of his fifth year for contact-
ing an agent and getting free concert tickets from a bank.
Lloyd stripped Marcus of his captaincy.
So there sat Marcus Ray, or at least a shell of the usually
proud Marcus Ray. This was the severely depressed, woe-is-
me Marcus Ray.
Brady bottom-lined it for Marcus. This would be how he
got his name back:
No.1 - Stay out ofthe media.
No.2 - Talk to Lloyd, and make sure he knowsyou're work-
ing out.
No. - Stay in school, get good grades, graduate on time.
No. 4 - "Whenyou come back topractice, whileyou're sus-
pended, play on the scout team. That's Michigan."
"And I'm going to ask you the same question I asked you
three years ago: What do you wantxyour legacy to be?
"How do you want to be remembered at Michigan?"
Marcus's legacy, his name, would stay intact if he listened
to Brady.
"It makes you look at yourself in the mirror and say,
'What does my name mean now? And what do I want it to
say when I'm done,"' Marcus says.
By the time he graduated, he liked what he saw in the
Flash-forward to February 2011, you'll see 34-year old
Marcus Ray, sitting across from Brady Hoke again, unsure
if his name is dirty or clean. They're at a coach's conference
in Columbus.
"I don't think you were as focused as you needed to be at
Central Michigan," Brady says to Marcus. "I don't think you
took advantage of that opportunity. I think you were screw-
ing around a little bit. But it happens. I love you and I want
you to work for me."
After his stint in the NFL, Marcus became a coach

because he wasn't sure what he wanted to do. He jumped
around from high schools to colleges, but didn't go back to
Michigan until 2007, as a weight room coach, because he
thought his name was still muddied, even after he did every-
thing Brady instructed.
In his eighth year of coaching he had his shot as an assis-
tant coach at Central Michigan in 2008, but he was distract-
ed.
His wife and three kids were still living at home in
Columbus and his marriage was shaky. He wanted the best
of both worlds - to pursue his dream of coaching and be the
family man.
"I wasn'talwaysthe besthusband or fatherthat I could've
been, because I forgot what my name meant to me," Marcus
says now. "That'sthe power ofbeingaround peoplewhotalk
that language: They keep you in that mind state."
Two years later, he was coaching high schools again.
Three years later, his divorce was finalized.
Marcus needed Brady Hoke now more than ever. Mar-
cus was doing public speaking tours, but would drop it all
to work with Brady Hoke. He nearly screwed up everything
at Central Michigan, trying to jump onto Brady's rising star
at Ball State.
Now he wanted to know if Brady thought people saw the
changed 34-year old Marcus or the 21-year old Marcus.
"You were the only one who believed in me years ago and
I need you to be that guy again at 34 years old." Marcus told
him.
"I will," Brady said. "Stay in touch."
And then Brady was gone, leaving Marcus alone again
with the mirror.
If Brady Hoke had a son, he'd be something like Glen
Steele.
From afar, Glen looks like just a country boy from Ligoni-
er, Indiana, who needed football to let out his aggression.
The son of a factory worker once tackled his friend through
a wooden fence. He asked himself the same question before
every high school game he played: Somebody's going to get
knocked out this game, who's itgoingto be?
Big and bruising at 260 pounds in high school. They
called him the "big bully." Teams would send three guys to
block him, four to tackle him.
When he got to Michigan, the kid from the small town
had too much freedom. He had a little
too much fun. He needed to do some
growing up off the field.
Get closer.
You'll see Glen's father taught him
to respect his elders and that quarter-
backs have Dad to thank for always
teaching him: "If you're going to do
it, you're going to finish it," including
sacking the quarterback.
You'll see how then-head coach
Gary Moeller told Glen, who was
recruited as a tight end, to jump in at
defensive end one day. He loved it.
A kid that aggressive was bound to
play defense eventually.
Get even closer. That's where Brady
Hoke is.
Glen's actually a gentle giant, with-
out an ego to speak of. Laura Hoke
would later say Glen has a "big heart,"
just like Brady. Lloyd Carr would later
say Glen's greatest asset was that he

was a great listener. Glen knew he needed coaching, mold-
ing.
Brady pulled Glen close, taught him how to play with
technique, burning it into his muscle memory with repeti-
tion after repetition.
Hands are high and inside. Use your hips. Feet shoulder
width apart. Don't stand up too high. Taking that six-inch
power step.
In the film room, Brady made Glen watch how former
Michigan legends played the right way, with the effort run-
ning to the ball, the attitude and technique Brady wanted.
This is the way Michigan players play, he said.
Tradition was one of Brady's biggest teaching tools. He'd
take a guy aside and tell him, "You have the ability to do
what this guy did." And he was talking about All-Ameri-
cans, All-Big Ten guys.
"You don't change tradition," Glen says. "You come
through, you learn a tradition. You respect a tradition. You
understand tradition. You pass it along to the next group of
guys. What you leave is your legacy. What kind of player was
this guy? What kind of person was this guy? What kind of
character did he have?"
What does your name mean to you?
Brady knows that Glen's athleticism and madman atti-
tude is a start, but with knowledge and solid technique, Glen
could be a fundamentally-sound madman off the edge.
Brady could be hard on Glen, especially about his back
injury that lingered all three years Brady coached him.
"Oh, back hurts? Not going to practice today?" Brady
would tease.
"That's him being him," Glen says. "And that's him still
lighting that fire under my ass."
Years later, Glen's back would require three surgeries.
Brady knew Glen would tough it out for a few days, lead-
ing by example. By the 1997 season, when Glen was a fifth-
year senior, he was the only veteran left on the line. That
didn't mean Brady didn't chew Glen out.
"There was no bullshit, he'd call you out on it," Glen says.
"If you were late or missing class, you would take your licks,
that'd be running extra after practice, running the stadium
at six in the morning."
"You have horseshit hands," Brady told Glen one day.
"Your hands were not very good today. Is your wrist banged
up? Are your hands banged up?"
"Nah, it was just not a good day for me," Glen said.
"Well that can't happen in a game."
"I understand and it won't."

Stopping Hillman key for Blue defense

explode into each dummy up and down the line with his
forearm. Brady expected them to move the whole sled by
themselves.
Wired like Brady, from a good family but tough as nails,
Jeff didn't mind. So Brady pulled Jeff close, took a liking to
the kid. Knew he could push Jeff.
"Jeff Barr was a miniature Brady Hoke," Tanner said.
When Jeff came to practice without his helmet on, Brady
would bark: "That's a Power Drill," which meant extra sui-
cide sprints after practice.
The next day, Jeff made sure his helmet was one.
Again: "That's a Power Dill!"
"What for?" Jeff asked.
"I don't know, but I've got all day to think of it," Brady
replied.
He'd tease Jeff. But in those serious moments he taught
Jeff everything he knew about playing linebacker.
"That was the way my Dad was on me," Jeff says. "I guess
I liked it. I liked the attention. And I have a lot of respect
for Brady, so when I saw him give that back to me, that just
made me try harder."
Then Jeff taught Jesse Neal's oldest son everything he
knew about being a linebacker. Three years ago, the kid
broke all of Jeff's Yorktown tackling records that stood for
25 years.
Don't forget about those Neal boys.
Just ask Jay and Jesse where they'd be without Brady
Hoke.
Jay - the popular, big-strapping star running back -
almost cried every day because he had nowhere to go. His
parents divorced and living with three brothers, a sister and
a single working mother, he couldn't study at home. It was
chaos. There was no food in the refrigerator.
Jesse, the youngest boy, was the quiet one. His older
brothers thougt it was their duty to make Jesse tough, rough
him up. They would all get into "rock fights," throwing
stones the size of baseballs at each other.
"They're a rough bunch - fighting - and they don't take
no crap from nobody," Jeff says. "That whole family. All of
'em."
Jay and Jesse were running backs, but meeting a line-
backer in the hole? That was nothing.
Brady pulled them close too. He checked in on Jay's
grades, just like he did everyone else, making sure a Divi-
sion-I talent didn't go to waste. Jay considered quitting his
junior year. Brady went to his house and talked him out of it.
Brady guided Jay to Ball State, instead of bigger schools
that were farther away, where Jay would be lost in the shuf-
fle.
When Jay graduated, Tanner and Brady took turns taking

Jesse out to breakfast every morning, and they made sure
the skinny running back ate three meals a day.
Just like Brady's coaches at Ball State, Tanner cared about
molding the kids as people. Brady's college coaches had been
like that and Brady decided he liked Tanner's world.
"To me, that's what this whole thing is about," Brady said.
Laura and Brady sat down at the end of the season, and it
was clear Brady's calling was no longer to protect the Presi-
dent, like he thought. Those Yorktown boys changed every-
thing.
Those two years, Brady watched how Tanner made the
team a family. As Tanner put it: players play harder the more
they have invested in it.
Play for something pure, like the love of a family, and not
out of fear of being benched or other selfish goals. Play for
Dave Tanner. Play for Brady Hoke.
In the week leading up to the game against Delta in 1982,
Tanner had a team bonfire the night before the game. They
burned a fake Delta letterman jacket of his.
The guys went nuts.
Tanner wanted this year to be different: Delta was heav-
ily favored again, it was homecoming there and Yorktown
hadn't beaten its rival in quite some time. So Tanner pulled
his guys close.
A booster came up with the idea of having the mothers
write letters to every player and every coach rightbefore the
game. Tanner handed out the envelopes. He got one from
his mother. So did Brady.
"I'll tell you what, there was not a dry eye in that locker
room," Tanner says. "We could not say a word, could not
give a pep talk, because we were all crying."
Delta jumped out to a 12-0 lead by halftime. Yorktown
was too emotional.
Yorktown calmed down in the second half. In the fourth
quarter, Jay Neal burst through the line like a bowling ball,
running over defenders, legs churning. Jeff Barr, a two-way
starter at guard, sprinted down field to land more blocks.
The whole Delta game plan was to run away from Jeff when
he was at linebacker.
Jay Neal scored the game-winning touchdown. York-
town 13. Delta 12.
The whole town rushed the field.
"Dad, I'm not one of your football players!" Kelly Hoke
would shout.
Brady'sfather, John, ajunior-high principal, was strict with
him, so Brady is strict with his only daughter. All of Brady's
favorite words - accountability, responsibility, toughness -
Kelly hears them at home because Brady heard them.
The problem is he also has 100 sons to take care of
Laura and Kelly have adapted. The only night Brady is
guaranteed to be home - or at least nine times out of 10 - is
Thursday night,family night,for homemade pizza.
Laura and Brady didn't even think twice about the future
when Brady
left York-
JAY NEAL town to be
a graduate

gon State and then to Michigan. She always found a job.
But children need consistency.
"When your kids are young it's hard, because as adults we
can talk on the phone, you know, 'How's your day going?' "
Laura says. "But for a child to talk to their dad on the phone,
it's different.
"They need to see him and touch him."
Brady taught Kelly how to ride a bike, not how to shed
blocks. He took her trick-or-treating. Dad was there, but he
wanted to be therefor her all-the-timefor his actual daughter
like he was for his recruited sons.
"There's things," Brady says, sitting in his office at Schem-
bechler Hall, "that you'd always want to take back.
"I think we all live ourlives with some regret."

It's 1995 and Brady's office isn't as large yet as he'd like it
to be. For now, it's simple, just a desk and two chairs, with
photographs around the room of former players he helped,
people he wants to remember.
He's coachingthe defensive ends at Michigan, the school
he'd always dreamed of coaching at, and a troubled soul is
sitting across from him.
MarcusRay's name is hanging in the balance.
Brady's the only one Marcus can turn to. He can't talk
to Lloyd Carr. Marcus lied to Lloyd's face after he and two
teammates used someone else's credit card at the mall in
April1995.
Lloyd suspended him seven games.
Marcus was a "handful" by this point, having problems
with other guys on the team, over women, playing time and
status.
Brady's the new guy. This is a fresh face, one without a
negative opinion of Marcus. A face he can trust. And Marcus
wants to change.
How can I be a better teammate?
Am I as selfish asI've come off?
What does Lloyd think of me?
Marcus opens up to Brady as much as he can with a coach.

MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan coach Brady Hoke is
downplaying the fact that he's fac-
inghis oldcteam, San Diego State, on
Saturday. But he broke up via mass
text. The Aztecs have every incen-
tive to rub their
rebound season San Diego
in his face. And
they're trying to State at
do it with a bet- Michigan
ter looking form
of Brady Hoke's Matchup:
ideal offense. San Diego
It starts with Stale 3-0;
running back Michigan 3-0
Ronnie Hillman, When: Satur-
San Diego State's dat 12 P.M.
1,500-yard rush- Where: Michi-
er from a year gan Stadium
ago. In three TV/Radio:
games this sea- BTN
son, he's rushed
for just under
500 yards and eight touchdowns.
"They say he's a Heisman candi-
date," defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison said. "When I watch the
film I see it. I'm not voting. This is
a guy that can be physical, can be
really quick and make you miss
tackles, and has and will run away
from you if he gets in the open field.
He's got all of those things. This
will be the toughest back we've
played, without a doubt."
For No. 22 Michigan's defense,
one aspect of Hillman's game
sticks out above all the others: his
speed, which makes him especial-
ly dangerous when he gets to the

outside. The Wolverines' chances
of success will likely rely on the
defensive line's ability to keep con-
tain and funnel Hillman towards
the linebackers.
Luckily for Michigan, the
defense practices against a similar
type of talent daily. He may not be
a running back, but junior quarter-
back Denard Robinson has been
known to break a long run or two.
"Denard's such a fast running
back, and if you blink your eye he'll
get outside," fifth-year senior Troy
Woolfolk said. "So I think going
against Denard every day allows us
to help our defense contain and put
a cap on long runs."
But the practice hasn't helped
the rush defense recently. Despite
the defensive line ostensibly being
one of the strengths of the team
entering the season, Notre Dame
and Eastern Michigan ran over the
Wolverines for an average of 202.5
yards per game.
Since the NCAA doesn't count
the Wolverines' lightning-short-
ened game in its official statis-
tics, Western Michigan's 96-yard
performance doesn't count when
ranking the rush defense. The
other two games have Michigan
103rd in the country. Hillman is
second nationally in rushing yards,
37 yards behind South Carolina's
Marcus Lattimore.
If Michigan can stop Hillman,
it'll move on to the passing game,
led by San Diego State quarterback
and NFL prospect Ryan Lind-
ley. Contain him as well, and all
the offense has to do is figure out

Aztecs coach Rocky Long's compli-
cated 3-3-5 defense.
"He's taken a 3-3 concept and
created a lot of looks from the 3-3
that makes it hardly recognizable
as a 3-3," said offensive coordinator
Al Borges, who coached with Long
at San Diego State. "What seems
to be very helter-skelter is not at
all. It's a very disciplined style.
Every guy's in a gap. Everyone has
a responsibility. Coverage is sound.
"But it's not what you see every
week, and that requires a little
more preparation. It's almost like
facing a wishbone team when
you've never seen a wishbone
team."
Robinson will be faced with
cracking it as he tries to find a
rhythm in the passing game.
He's completing just 49.1 per-
cent of his passes, attributing most
of his failure to happy feet. But he
continues to beat teams with his
feet.
Hoke said this week that oppo-
nents run different defenses than
Michigan studies on tape because
they vastly change their gameplan
for Robinson. And if there's any-
body who can cook up a unique
defense, it's Long.
"Oh man," Robinson said.
"They're defensive coordinator is
probably a genius at the defense
they're running, they throw a lot
of stuff at you. ... It's kind of crazy
defense."
While Hoke's never coached
against a Long defense, he's seen
nearly everybody on San Diego
State before.

WHAT DOES YOUR

NAME MEAN TO YOUThequestion thatmadeBrady
. oke the coath he istoday.y


YORKTOWN, Ind. - Dave Tanner drove his light blue
Volkswagen Bug just down the road, past the corn stalks and
past the homes of all his players and boosters. Past the big
white water tower with "YORKTOWN" in green lettering,
with a tiger painted on the side.
He was on his way to interview Brady Hoke. He hoped
Brady could teach his linebackers how to make the perfect
fundamental tackle, but also join him in building a football
family.
This town is all some knew. Generations lived and died
here.
How would Brady Hoke fit in? What would his legacy be?
How would his name be remembered?
Tanner drove through the heart of Yorktown, a downtown
you could easily miss if you weren't looking for it.
Now, not much has changed on Smith Street since Tanner
coached the Yorktown football team in the 1980s. There's only
one barbershop, one florist, one stoplight - and three bars.
An old tractor is parked next to a shed. Houses line its main
street like it's a neighborhood. The close-knit community
strangles even its most urban area.
And if you're not looking close enough, you'll miss Merrill
Quate, a family man in a family town, sitting on a lawn swing
in his front yard, petting his dog Shelly and sipping a cup of
coffee. From afar his face wears a permanent frown, but his
wrinkles are deceiving. If youtake the time to talk to him, he'll
flash a toothy grin.
He looks out at the small downtown, calmly enjoying his
evening. He can see everything from his spot. You could never
tell, even talking to him, that Merrill has Alzheimer's disease.
He has good days and bad.
"Nothing going on in Yorktown," Merrill says turning to
the empty street behind him. "Kind of a dead-ass place."
Merrill grew up down the road in Muncie before movingto
Yorktown with his second wife Dottie. This is Dottie's home.
Born and raised. Her son Ty played for coach Tanner.
Dottie comes outside and seems to worry about Merrill.
They usually play Bingo every night with the other seniors of
Yorktown to keep Merrill sharp.
"He can't remember everything," she begins. "He can
remember his childhood, but he can't remember what hap-
pened yesterday."
She sighs as Merrill returns from his spot.
"Quiet little town," he says.
"The church is over there," he points. "The school is over
there."
"It really is a nice town," Dottie adds. "It's home."
His family is here. Hers is too. She waves to an elderly cou-
ple riding their bikes across the street. All their friends are
here.
Dottie sees them all when Yorktown plays its cross-town
rival Delta High School. It's standing room only for those
games.
Ty still talks about his 16-tackle, two-sack game during his
senior year against Delta.
Ty's highschool buddies - Jeff Barr and Jay and Jesse Neal
- still meet him at Mr. Mouse, the bar around the corner, to

talk about the glory days.
But first, their old coach, Dave Tanner, had to pull up to
Brady's apartment that day, a few miles down the road but
a long way from Brady's world. Tanner was about to invite
Brady into his world.
Tanner needed to hire a linebackers coach, and Brady's
coach at Ball State had referred him as a player who used all
of his eligibility and needed a part-time job while he finished
school.
Brady had no intentions of becoming a coach. After the
assassination attempt of Ronald Reagan, he thought it was his
duty to become a secret service agent to protect the President.
"Are you interested in coaching?" Tanner began. "And tell
me a little bit about your background."
Brady started talking about his mom and his dad, the two
people who always kept him on the path, no matter how much
he zigged and zagged.
Then he started talking about Laura, the girl he met in sev-
enth grade, the girl he married at Ball State, the girl who was
his best friend.
"Shoot, this is the guy I want," Tanner thought to himself.
"You've got values. You've got commitment. He's a family per-
son."
Within five minutes of walking through the door, Tanner
decided this was his guy.
He stayed another two hours talking about life.
Brady Hoke remembers he had two goals at Ball State: "Play
football and probably drink every beer in Muncie, Indiana."
As a student, Laura would come home from work for lunch
and Brady would be outside throwing the football around with
his buddy.
"Brady, aren'tyou supposed to be in class?"Laura would ask,
looking at her watch.
"No, they cancelled it."
"Brady,"Laura said sternly. "The sun is shining. They did not
cancel class today."
She was right.
"I think it was something within Brady that he knew he need-
ed to buckle up - I mean, we were marriedfor goodness sake,"
Laura says now.
"He was a kid and needed to grow up."
The act continued until Chris Allen, Brady's linebackers coach
at Ball State, sat him down.
"What does your name mean to you?"Allen asked.
This was bigger than Brady. He didn't care that his own name
was being muddied, but what about his older brother Jon, who
played at Ball State? Or his parents? When Brady was out back
tossing the football, skipping class, he wasn't thinking how he
was muddying his family, his teammates, his school and his
coaches. They were why his name meant anything in the first
place - he represented them too. There were people in his life
worth choosing rightfor.
That day, Brady Hoke realized his name meant a whole lot to
Brady Hoke.

This day is dreary, so the sun isn't out to cast a shadow of
the tall water tower, onto Yorktown High School. It's a Mon-
day and the JV team is playing Delta, but there are fewer peo-
ple in the stands than players on the field.
Cars drive up and down Tiger Drive, right over the yellow
paw prints painted on the road leading up to the school.
Brady, Tanner and the other coaches stayed up all night
painting those paw prints. That was the week before they
played Delta in '82. Now it's tradition - one of the few lasting
physical marks Brady left on the school.
But what measures the true mark a coach leaves?
You have to get around the right people to hear stories
about those 1981 and 1982 seasons - Brady's only two years
at the school.
You have to find one of the boys Tanner used to show Ball
State highlighttape to before their games. Jarring hits and big
plays flashed. Every defensive clip had Brady in it.
Few people heard the stories Brady told Tanner, about
gouging players' faces so they wouldn't want to run to his side
anymore.
When he was at Ball State, Western Michigan's scouting
report said: "Very physical football player, who's very smart.
And will knock the crap out of you."
Fresh out of college, he was already a celebrity at Yorktown.
The kids didn't know Brady wasn't the most athletic guy on
the field, or that he had to become a technician, really learn
the game and how to study film, to develop into a team cap-
tain.
That didn't matter. Those boys never forgot how Brady ran
sprints with them, winning every race, and how he knocked
them over when he demonstrated drills. They never forgot
how hard he slapped the side of their helmets when they made
him proud and how they smiled even though it hurt.
They never forgot how he made them laugh, then looked
them in the eye when it was time to work: "Do we have a prob-
lem here? This is what we're goingto do in practice today: I'm
goingto push you."
They wouldn't let him down.
He was old enough to be your brother, but he coached like
a father. He'd ask about school, their families, but he could
already tell if something was wrong. Then he'd talk to them
in private.
The closer he pulled you, the more you grew.
He knew which ones to push and which ones needed anoth-
er father.
Just ask Jeff Barr how much he knew about playing line-
backer before Brady Hoke got there.
Jeff would tell you how his style was simple before he met
Brady: line up and run to the ball like a maniac. How Brady's
practices consisted of hitting. Hitting. And then more hitting.
How Brady would spend a whole 20-minute practice period
showing the linebackers how to use their forearm to shed a
block.
Brady loved the seven-man sled - each linebacker had to
