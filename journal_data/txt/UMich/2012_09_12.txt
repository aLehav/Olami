Snyder vetoes have
irked some state
Republicans
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
Legislatures in several
states, including Michigan,
have garnered nationwide
attention in recent months for
passing, or attempting to pass,
stricter voter identification
requirements in order for citi-
zens to legally cast ballots in
November's election.
According to the Natioal
Conference of State Legisla-
tures - a bipartisan organiza-
tion that serves as a resource
for state legislators - 31 states,
including Michigan, have
enacted laws that will require
all voters to present a form of
identification at the polls this
November.
Michigan's voter identifica-
tion law - which was passed
in 2007 - requires voters to.
show a form of photo identi-
fication prior to voting, but
those without ID remain eli-
gible to vote if they sign an

affidavit.
In-Michigan, ifa voter does
not possess a form of photo
ID, he or she can sign an affi-
davit of identity verifying his
or her identity and will still be
eligible to vote. Some states,
however, are eliminating the
.....affidavit-option.
Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der irked Republicans in July
when he
became the
only GOP gov-
ernor to veto 2
a bill requir-
ing stricter
ID laws in
the past two years. The bill he
shot down would've required
absentee voters to present a
photo ID, a measure proposed
by his fellow Republicans in
the Michigan state Legisla-
ture. He also vetoed a proposal
endorsed by Republican Sec-
retary of State Ruth Johnson
that would require voters to
check a box on their ballots
stating they are U.S. citizens.
Proponents believe the laws
are necessary to curb voter
fraud when, for example,

Event unites
campus 11 years
after terrorist
attacks
By KATIE BURKE
Daily StaffReporter
For University students walk-
ing through the Diag Tuesday, it
was impossible to miss the 2,977

flags covering the grass in mem-
ory of the victims of the Sept. 11,
2001 terror attacks.
The flags were part of the
9/11: Never Forget Project, held
by the University's chapter of
College Republicans and the
Young America's Foundation -
a national conservative political
organization thathas beenhold-
ing similar events at campuses
across the country since 2003.
Donations for Freedom Alliance
and Michigan Remembers 9-11

were also collected throughout
the day, and a candlelight vigil
was held at 9 p.m.
LSA senior Rachel Jankows-
ki, chair of the University's
chapter of College Republicans,
said she organized the vigil as
a way to honor the friends and
family members of University
students who were affected by
the terrorist attacks 11 years
ago.
"(The vigil) touches so many
students on this campus, not

only the event but the peo-
ple that were affected by it,"
Jankowski said. "There have
been so many people that have
come up today and said that
they were from New York or
New Jersey ... it touched everyr
one, especially on this campus."
During the vigil, tea lights
surrounded the flags as a wide
circle of students observed a
moment of silence to remember
the victims.

UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
Physics department travels to
Chinese partner for first time

During summer
trip, students

engage in research
projects
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
While most students spent
their summer days relaxing or
working at jobs or internships
around the nation, three Univer-
sity students traveled to China to
explore research opportunities
in the sciences.
After a nearly 20-year part-
nership with the University
of Science and Technology of
China, the University's physics

department sent students to the
Chinese school located in Hefei,
four hours outside of Shanghai,
for the first time this summer.
Physics Prof. James Liu,
organizer of the department's
exchange program for the past
three years, said while the pro-
gram's overall feedback was pos-
itive, there were a few first-year
kinks to iron out, such as com-
munication trouble with USTC.
Liu added that he plans to use
different communication strate-
gies in the coming year.
"I think in the future we might
want to do more Skyping - Skype
definitely works," Liu said.
While the program is intended
for physics research, Liu said
diverse groups of students are
considered, including unde-

clared students who show inter-
est in the department and are
taking physics classes, as well as
pre-medical students, biophysics
students and chemistry students
with significant interest in phys-
ics research.
LSA junior Nico Wagner went
to Hefei and applied for a bio-
physics-oriented project. He was
placed with a team researching
stochastic optical reconstruction
microscopy, a high-resolution
imagingtechnique.
Wagner said his research was
unexpectedly stalled when an
important laser broke shortly
after he arrived, and he was
required to halt his project com-
pletely until the program could
reassign him to a new lab.

Student gov't
struggled with
outreach during
welcome week
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
The Central Student Gov-
ernment assembly provision-
ally approved three executive
positions at Tuesday's meeting,

after losing multiple meetings as
a result of the delayed approval
of its 2012 election results last
semester.
LSA junior Chris Osborn,
LSA sophomore Yuexin Han and
Business junior Eric Kibler were
conditionally approved as trea-
surer, chair of Student Organi-
zation Funding Commission and
chief of staff, respectively. For
the second consecutive week, no
resolutions were proposed.
In an interview after the
meeting, CSG president Man-

ish Parikh, a Business senior,
said candidates for the positions
would have been nominated and
confirmed at the end of the win-
ter 2012 semester had meetings
not been lost due to the March
2012 election delays.
Since the executive nomina-
tions committee had not yet
reviewed the nominations sub-
mitted by Parikh and CSG vice
president Omar Hashwi, an LSA
junior, the positions were only
provisionally confirmed. This

CRITTCAL PATRTOTTSM

Celebrating Armenian culture

For LSA senior Satenig Mir-
zoyan and Public Policy senior
Lorig Stepanian, co-presidents
of the Armenian Students Cul-
tural Association, membership
in ASCA provides a welcoming
place to celebrate Armenia's
rich heritage, educate students
.in relevant issues and connect
Armenian students on campus.
Mirzoyan said the approxi-
mately 60 students involved
with ASCA meet for the
-opportunity to further
immerse themselves in Arme-
nian culture, despite the geo-
graphical divide between the
University and their ancestral
home.
ASCA's largest annual
CRIME NOTES

event is its January Char-
ity Ball, though members also
often attend activities such as
lectures relevant to Armenian
culture and issues on cam-
pus. The group also partakes
in activities such as cooking
traditional food, listening to
Armenian music and practic-
ing Armenian dances.
Mirzoyan said the Arme-
nian presence on campus
made her transition to the
University much easier.
"The seniors in the Arme-
nian Club when I was a fresh-
man were very helpful in
picking classes, in having a
place to go and just hanging
out with them in general ... it

was a good way of having a
family (here)," Mirzoyan said.
Stepanian added that she
appreciates the familiar com-
munity ASCA has built, citing
Armenian holidays as criti-
cal times to take part in her
cultural practices with other
members.
While the majority of stu-
dents within ASCA come
from Armenian heritage, Ste-
panian and Mirzoyan said the
group's welcoming environ-
ment encourages non-Arme-
nian students to attend events
with friends to learn more
about the culture.

dismissal is under
investigation
DICKINSON, N.D. (AP) - A
concussion kept Jamie Kuntz
from suiting up for his first col-
lege football game. A kiss from
his much-older boyfriend at that
game led the freshman line-
backer tobe kicked off the team,
he said.
North Dakota State College of
Sciences in Wahpeton acknowl-
edges Kuntz was disciplined
by the team, but says it wasn't
because he is gay. Football coach
Chuck Parsons told Kuntz in a
letter that he was removed from
the team for lying about the kiss.
Kuntz, 18, and on a partial
football scholarship, left the col-
lege in southeast North Dakota
this month after his dismissal
from the team.
"Football didn't work out, so
there was no reason to stay," said
Kuntz, who lives with his mother
across the state in Dickinson.
Kuntz said he and his 65-year-
old boyfriend were in the press
box at the game against Snow
College in Pueblo, Colo., over
Labor Day weekend. Kuntz was
videotaping the game for the
team. His Wildcats were downby
more than 40 points when "the
kiss just happened," he said. The
team would eventually lose 63-17.
"People around here aren't
exposed to it," Kuntz said of
homosexuality. "People expect
gays to be flamboyant, not foot-
ball players."
A teammate apparently saw
the kiss and told coaches, Kuntz
said. When Parsons confront-
ed Kuntz on the bus ride back
to North Dakota, Kuntz told
him the man he kissed was his
grandfather.
"I lied," Kuntz said.
Later, he feltguilty about lying
and came clean to his coach.
In a Sept. 3 dismissal let-
ter obtained by The Associated
Press, Parsons told Kuntz he
was being ousted from the team
under the "conduct deemed det-
rimental to the team" category

outlined in guidelines in the
team's player's manual. Parsons
specifically noted the manual's
section on "lying to coaches,
teachers or other school staff."
"This decision was arrived at
solely on the basis of your con-
duct during the football game;
and because you chose not to be
truthful with me when I con-
fronted you about whom else
was in the box with you," Par-
sons wrote. "Any conduct by
any member of the program that
would cause such a distraction
during a game would warrant
the same consequences."
Kuntz doesn't believe he was
dismissed just for lying.
"I know if it was a girl in
the press box, or even an older
woman, nothing would have
happened," he said. "If it was
an older woman, I would have
probably been congratulated for
it from my teammates."
School officialstoldtheAPthat
they were investigating whether
this was the first such instance
of someone being kicked off the
football team for lying.


John Richman, North Dakota
State College of Science presi-
dent, said other players have
been kicked off the team for var-
ious reasons, though he couldn't
say whether any before had been
booted specifically for lying.
"I don't know of every single
case where coach Parsons has had
to discipline a young man," Rich-
mansaid.
Other behavior that the
player's manual says could lead
to dismissal includes criminal
violations, fighting and repeat-
ed absences or tardiness to
class. Richman said he believes
Kuntz's case was handled "fairly
and consistently" by the athletic
department.
"I'm very confident that with
the information that's been
provided to me by our football
coach, Chuck Parsons, by our
athletic director, Stu Engen,
that the thought process, the
facts that were reviewed, have
led them to an appropriate and
the right decision in this case,"
Richman said Tuesday in an
interview at the college.

The founder of an Iowa bro-

China sends patrol
ships to islands
heldby Japan
A territorial flare-up between
China and Japan intensified as
two Beijing-sent patrol ships
arrived near disputed East China
Sea islands in a show of anger over
Tokyo's purchase of the largely
barren outcroppings from their
private owners.
The China Marine Surveillance
has drawn up a plan to safeguard
China's sovereignty of the islands
and the ships were sent to assert
those claims, China's official Xin-
hua News Agency said Tuesday.
The marine agency is a paramili-
tary force whose ships are often
lightly armed.
The rocky islands, known as
Senkaku to Japanese and Diaoyu
to Chinese, have been the focus of
recurringspats betweenthe coun-
tries and also are claimed by Tai-
wan. The China-Japan dispute has
been heating up in recent months,

in part because the nationalist
governor of Tokyo proposed buy-
ing the islands and developing
them.

California stink

Air quality investigators have

Officials from the South Coast

trict said in a statement Tuesday
that collected air samples have
given solid evidence of what they
already expected: A huge fish
die-off at the saltwater lake 150
miles southeast of Los Angeles
combined with winds to create
the sulfur-like smell that people
across the region reported Mon-
day.
The air samples showed that
hydrogen sulfide levels were
highest around the lake and grew
weaker at longer distances, and
modeling showed the smell could
have traveled a fairly long dis-
tance in Monday's weather condi-
tions.

Memorials honor
lives lost on 11th
anniversary of
attacks
NEW YORK (AP) - There
were still the tearful messages
to loved ones, clutches of pho-
tos and flowers, and moments of
silence. But 11 years after Sept.
11, Americans appeared to enter
a new, scaled-back chapter of
collective mourning for the
worst terror attack in U.S his-
tory.
Crowds gathered, as always,
at the World Trade Center site
in New York, the Pentagon
and a Pennsylvania memorial
Tuesday to mourn the nearly
3,000 victims of the 2001 ter-
ror attacks, reciting their names
and remembering with music,
tolling bells and prayer. But
they came in fewer numbers,
ceremonies were less elaborate
and some cities canceled their
remembrances altogether. A
year after the milestone 10th
anniversary, some said the
memorials may have reached an
emotional turning point.
"It's human nature, so people
move on," said Wanda Ortiz, of
New York City, whose husband,
Emilio Ortiz, was killed in the
trade center's north tower,
leaving behind her and their
5-month-old twin daughters.
"My concern now is ... how I
keep the memory of my husband
alive."
It was also a year when politi-
cians largely took a back seat to
grieving families; no elected offi-
cials spoke at all at New York's
31/2 -hour ceremony. President
Barack Obama and Republican
Mitt Romney pulled negative
campaign ads and avoided ral-
lies, with the president laying
a wreath at the Pentagon cer-
emony and visiting wounded
soldiers at a Maryland hospital.
And beyond the victims of the
2001 attacks, attention was paid
to the wars that followed in Iraq
and Afghanistan.
In Middletown, N.J., a bed-
room community that lost 37
residents in the attacks, town
officials laid a wreath at the
entrance to the park in a small,
silentceremony. Lastyear, 3,700

people attended a remembrance
with speeches, music and
names read.
"This year," said Deputy
Mayor Stephen Massell, "I
think less is more."
Some worried that moving on
would mean Sept. 11 will fade
from memory.
"It's been 11 years already,"
said Michael Reneo, whose
sister-in-law, Daniela Notaro,
was killed at the trade center.
"And unfortunately for some,
the reality of this day seems to
be fading as the years go by....
I hope we never lose focus on
what really happened here."
Thousands had attended the
ceremony in New York in previ-
ous years, including last year's
milestone 10th anniversary.
In New York, a crowd of fewer
than 200 swelled to about 1,000
by late Tuesday morning, as
family members laid roses and
made paper rubbings of their
loved ones' names etched onto
the Sept.t11tmemorial. A few
hundred attended ceremonies
at the Pentagon and in Shanks-
ville, Pa., fewer than in years
past.
As bagpipes played at the
year-old Sept. 11 memorial in
New York, families holding
balloons, flowers and photos
of their loved ones bowed their
heads in silence at 8:46 a.m., the
moment that the first hijacked
jetliner crashed into the trade
center's north tower. Bells
tolled to mark the moments that
planes crashed into the second
tower, the Pentagon and a Penn-
sylvania field, and the moments
that each tower collapsed.
President Obama and first
lady Michelle Obama laid a
white floral wreath at the Pen-
tagon, above a concrete slab that
said "Sept. 11, 2001 - 937 am."
Obama later recalled the horror
of the attacks, declaring, "Our
country is safer and our people
are resilient."
Vice President Joe Biden
remembered the 40 victims of
the plane that crashed in a field
south of Pittsburgh, saying he
understood 11 years haven't
diminished memories.
"Today is just as monumental
a day for all of you, for each of
your families, as any Sept.11 has
ever been," he said.

Later, Libyan
protesters storm
consulate in
Benghazi
CAIRO (AP) - Mainly ultra-.
conservative protesters climbed
the walls of the U.S. Embassy
in Egypt's capital Tuesday and
brought down the American
flag, replacing it with a black
Islamist flag to protest a U.S.-
produced film attacking the
Prophet Muhammad. Hours
later, armed men in eastern
Libya also stormed the US con-
sulate there and set it on fire as
anger spread.
It was the first time ever that
the U.S. Embassy in Cairo has
been breached and comes as
Egypt is struggling to overcome
months of unrest following the
ouster of Hosni Mubarak's auto-
cratic regime. U.S. officials said
no Americans were reported
harmed in the assaults in Cairo
or the eastern city of Benghazi.
The unrest in Cairo began
when hundreds of protest-
ers marched to the downtown
embassy, gathering outside its
walls and chanting against the
movie and the U.S.
"Say it, don't fear: Their
ambassador must leave," the
crowd chanted.
Dozens of protesters then
scaled the embassy walls, and
several went into the courtyard
and took down the flag from a

pole. They brought it back to
the crowd outside, which tried
to burn it, but failing that tore
it apart.
The protesters on the wall
then raised on the flagpole a
black flag with a Muslim decla-
ration of faith, "There is no god
but God and Muhammad is his
prophet." The flag, similar to
the banner used by al-Qaida, is
commonly used by ultraconser-
vatives around the region.
The crowd grew throughout
the evening with thousands
standing outside the embassy.
Dozens of riot police lined up
along the embassy walls but did
not stop protesters as they con-
tinued to climb and stand on
the wall - though it appeared
no more went into the com-
pound.
The crowd chanted, "Islamic,
Islamic. The right of our proph-
et will not die." Some shouted,
"We are all Osama," referring
to al-Qaida leader bin Laden.
Young men, some in masks,
sprayed graffiti on the walls.
Some grumbled that Islamist
President Mohammed Morsi
had not spoken out about the
movie.
A group of women in black
veils and robes that left only
their eyes exposed chanted,
"Worshippers of the Cross,
leave the Prophet Muhammad
alone."
By midnight, the crowd had
dwindled. The U.S. Embassy
said on its Twitter account that
there will be no visa services on

Wednesday because of the pro-
tests.
A senior Egyptian security
official at the embassy area said
authorities allowed the pro-
test because it was "peaceful."
When they started climbing the
walls, he said he called for more
troops, denying that the pro-
testers stormed the embassy. He
spoke on condition of anonym-
ity because he was not autho-
rized to speak to reporters.
The protest was sparked
by outrage over a video being
promoted by an extreme anti-
Muslim Egyptian Christian
campaigner in the United
States. A 14-minute trailer of
the movie, posted on the social
website YouTube in an original
English version and another
dubbed into Egyptian Arabic,
depicts Muhammad asa fraud, a
womanizer and a madman in an
overtly ridiculing way, showing
him having sex and calling for
massacres.
Muslims find it offensive to
depict Muhammad in any fash-
ion, much less in an insulting
way. The 2005 publication of
12 caricatures of the prophet
Muhammad in a Danish news-
paper triggered riots in many
Muslim countries.
In a sign of growing anger
over the film, Libyans set fire
to the U.S. Consulate in the
eastern city of Benghazi and
fired in the air after a protest
against the film. Witnesses
said much of the consulate was
burned.

Tensions between Iran, Israel rising
as Netanyahu critiques U.S. position,

Nations conflicted
about economic
sanctions directed
toward Tehran
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel is
sounding increasingly agitated
over what it views as American
dithering with economic sanc-
tions too weak to force Iran to
end its suspected drive toward
nuclear weapons.
In a clear message aimed at
the White House, Prime Min-
ister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Tuesday criticized what he
said was the world's failure to
spell out what would provoke a
U.S.-led military strike against
Iranian nuclear facilities. The
comments came in response to
U.S. refusals in recent days to set
"red lines" for Tehran.
With his strong words,
Netanyahu is taking a bold
gamble. He clearly hopes to
rattle the U.S. into doing more,
for fear that Israel might oth-
erwise soon attack Iran on its
own. But he risks antagonizing
President Barack Obama dur-
ing a re-election campaign and
straining relations with Israel's
closest and most important ally.
Relations between the two lead-
ers have often been tense in the
past.

Israeli officials say American
politics do not factor into their
thinking, but that the sense of
urgency is so grave that the world
cannot hold its breath until after
the November election.
"The world tells Israel, 'Wait.
There's still time,"' Netanyahu
said Tuesday. "And Isay: 'Wait for
what? Wait until when?' Those
in the international community
who refuse to put red lines before
Iran don't have a moral right to
place a red light before Israel."
Israel views a nuclear-armed
Iran as- a mortal threat, citing
Iran's persistent calls for the
destruction of the Jewish state,
its development of missiles
capable of striking Israel, and
Iranian support for Arab mili-
tant groups.
Tehran insists its nuclear pro-
gram is for peaceful purposes
only.
Although the United States has
accused Iran of trying to develop
nuclear weapon capability under
the cover of a peaceful program,
the Obama administration has
said it does not believe Iran has
decided whether to build an
atomic bomb - if it in fact devel-
ops the ability to do so.
Israeli officials believe time
is running short with Iran mov-
ing perilously close to reaching
weapons capability. They point to
Iranian enrichment of uranium, a
key ingredient in building a bomb,

the movement of Iranian nuclear
research facilities to fortified
underground bunkers impervi-
ous to attack, and Iran's refusal to
open its facilities to U.N. inspec-
tors.
On Tuesday, diplomats told
The Associated Press that the
U.N. atomic agency has received
new and significant intelligence
over the past month that Iran has
advanced its work on calculat-
ing the destructive power of an
atomic warhead through a series
of computer models within the
past three years.
The diplomats who spoke
to the AP said the informa-
tion came from Israel, the
United States and at least two
other Western countries. They
demanded anonymity because
they were not authorized to
discuss classified information
member countries make avail-
able to the IAEA.
The information could
strengthen concerns that Iran
has continued weapons work
into the recent past" and may
be continuing to do so. Because
computer modeling work is nor-
mally accompanied by physical
tests of the components that go
into nuclear weapons, it would
also buttress fears by the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency
that Tehran is advancing its
weapons research on multiple
fronts.

More than five
inches of rainfall in
Coachella Valley
LAS VEGAS (AP) - Intense
thunderstorms swept over parts
of the Southwest on Tuesday,
delaying flights and stranding
motorists in the Las Vegas area
and flooding two mobile home
parks in Southern California.
East of downtown Las Vegas,
television news video showed
yellow school buses inching
slowly along roads after school
in some neighbors and muddy
brown water up to the lower
window sills of stucco homes in
others.
A Twitter photo showed doz-
ens of cars swamped by water
up to their headlights in apark-
ing lot outside the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas sports arena.
But after responding to
numerous 911 calls, officials in
Clark County, North Las Vegas,
Henderson and Las Vegas said
Tuesday there were no con-
firmed reports of serious inju-
ries.
The National Weather Service
issued severe thunderstorm and
flash-flood warnings before and
after almost an inch of rain was
reported at McCarran Interna-
tional Airport just before 2 p.m.
Departures were postponed and
arrivals were delayed after the
airport ordered a stop on fuel-
ing operations during lightning
strikes, airport spokeswoman
Linda Healey said.
National Weather Service
meteorologist Michael Stauden-
maier said more than 1.75 inches

of rain were reported in down-
town Las Vegas.
Firefighters responded to
more than 20 calls about people
in stalled cars, county spokes-
man Dan Kulin said. A Las
Vegas police helicopter was dis-
patched during the height of the
storm to pluck several people
from swamped vehicles on area
roadways, Officer Bill Cassell
said.
Staudenmaier said the rain-
fall amounts put the region on
pace to exceed the 4.5 inches of
rain it normally gets ina year.
National Weather Service
meteorologist Scott Sukup said
the Nevada showers weren't
part of the same storm system
that drenched parts of Southern
California.
There, a thunderstorm that
dropped more than the aver-
age annual rainfall on parts
of the Coachella Valley in one
night alone caused flooding at
two mobile home parks, forced
road closures and dampened an
elementary school, officials said
Tuesday.
The early morning thunder-
storm stalled for six to eight
hours over Mecca and Ther-
mal, two towns at the southern
tip of the Coachella Valley 150
miles southeast of Los Angeles.
Thermal is about eight miles
from Indio, Calif., where the
annual Coachella Music Festi-
val is held.
The storm dropped 5.51
inches of rain near Mecca and
3.23 inches of rain near Ther-
mal, meteorologist Mark Moede
said. The average annual rain-
fall in Thermal is just shy of 3
inches, he said.

Educate to protect
Community effort can guard against sexual assault
A s students' e-mails are flooded with crime alerts as of late, inci-
dents of sexual assault have dominated the subject lines. Many
students, especially those new to campus, are feeling unset-
tled by the three incidents of alleged sexual assault that have happened
in the last 10 days. In light of the incidents, the University should take
time to re-educate students on its policies on sexual assault, its defini-
tion of sexual assault and ramifications on committing such an offense.

Necessary separation

n 2013 Saudi Arabia is plan-
ning to complete a new indus-
trial center open exclusively
to women near
the city of Hofuf.
The hope for
this center to
provide oppor-
tunities for the
many educated
women in Saudi
Arabia who are MRY
having trouble
establishing GALLAGHER
careers in the
male-dominated
workplace. At this point, 60 per-
cent of Saudi college graduates
are women but 78 percent of those
women are unemployed due in part
to complicated policies that make
it simpler to hire men. For exam-
ple, women are not allowed to deal
directly with the government and
are required to use a male colleague
as an in-between. In such an envi-
ronment, a man-dominated work-
force isn't surprising.
Many in the international com-
munity, however, are questioning
the effectiveness of establishing
a separate industrial center for
women. For one thing, it's possible
that this separation might enable
even more gender discrimination in
work environments outside of the
center. The center would, however,
continue to be gender-integrated.
As we all learned back in mid-
dle school when studying the civil
rights movement, "separate but
equal" rarely works out to actu-
ally be equal. More often, one sepa-

rated group is made to be inferior.
The working conditions in Hofuf
will not be entirely equal to those
in other parts of Saudi Arabia and
this presents two potential prob-
lems. If the women's industrial cen-
ter is superior to others across the
country, men will be denied access
to a real chance for economic devel-
opment, allowing women to pull
ahead economically. And, if condi-
tions in Hofuf are inferior, women
may feel as though it is the only
employment option available, forc-
ing them to settle. This is especially
a concern if potential employers
take the attitude that if women
have their own place exclusively for
them, they can go there to work and
not take jobs that men need to sup-
port their families.
On the other hand, this separate
industrial center could provide
much-needed opportunities for
Saudi women. Experienced work-
ing women will have a chance to be
immediately in charge of their own
businesses instead of fighting for
years to break Saudi Arbias strict
the glass ceiling. Even in America
women are struggling to make it to
the top levels - only 39 companies
out of the Forbes 100 are headed
by female CEOs. Having their own
center, free from at least internal
gender discrimination, if not from
their society's underlying inequali-
ties, will open up new opportuni-
ties for women at top levels.
Even if this separate but equal
solution doesn't quite follow the
principles of feminism and civil
rights, at least it gives women who

want the chance to perhaps become
financially independent . A simi-
lar compromise was reached in
America before the top universities
began allowing women to enroll,
with the formation of exclusively
female college such as Smith and
Bryn Mawr Colleges. These schools
enabled women to prove that, given
the right resources and opportuni-
ties, they can do just as well as men.
As a gender-segregated industry is
not seen as a permanent solution
but a stepping-stone on the way to
gender equality across integrated
workplaces.
Compromise
may ultimately
lead to greater
opportunities.
In an ideal world, women would
not have to fight to prove they are
worthy of equal employment. How-
ever, this is not an ideal world, and
sometimes less-than-perfect solu-
tions are necessary to address the
issues at hand. Industrial centers
like the one outside Hofuf are an
imperfect compromise, but they are
a compromise that may ultimately
lead to greater opportunities for
Saudi women.

Over Labor Day weekend, three incidents
of sexual assault were conveyed to DPS. The
police reports describe Asian males with the
same approximate height. On Friday, another
incident of suspicious touching was reported,
and the description of the individual resembles
that of the previous incidents.
Sexual assault prevention education must be
made a priority on campus. While SAPAC runs
workshops for incoming freshmen each year,
there should be follow-up sessions for upper-
classmen that reiterate this information. The
definitions of sexual assault need to be clear,
so students can correctly identify incidents of
sexual assault.
At the University of Montana, every stu-
dent is required to watch a video about sexual
assault definitions and consequences. Students
are subsequently required to earn a perfect
score on an accompanying test. The Univer-
sity of Michigan should explore options like
these to ensure the serious prevalence of sexual
assault on college campuses isn't passed over.
Students also need to take advantage of the
variety of safety measures provided by the
University. There are many resources offered
to help protect student safety as well as assist
survivors. Safewalk and Ride Home are options
that help students get home safely at night.
There are also Blue Light systems across cam-

pus, through which students immediately con-
nect to authorities in cases of danger.
Finally, the University's Office of Student
Conflict Resolution offers a service to report
sexual assault to the University without hav-
ing to speak to the police about the incident.
If a person is found responsible for commit-
ting sexual assault, the University will enforce
sanctions and consequences that it believes
are appropriate for the situation. All students
should be aware that a multitude of resources
are available to them.
According to SAPAC, sexual assault is "any
form of unwanted sexual contact obtained
without consent and/or obtained through
the use of force, threat of force, intimidation,
or coercion." There is still confusion among
students as to what exactly sexual assault is,
especially following the recent crime alert
description of "suspicious touching." SAPAC's
definition is comprehensive, but it needs to
widely distributed so students and the Ann
Arbor community are aware of what exactly
constitutes sexual assault. Students should be
clearly reminded on a regular basis that sexual
assault is not tolerated at this University.
Sexual assault is a serious matter that can't
be taken lightly. The University community
should act to re-affirm this stance and ensure
student safety on campus. {

MICHAEL

The 2,977 American flags displayed on the
Diag Tuesday represented the victims of the
tragic terrorist attack eleven years ago. The
ceremony put me in a pensive and emotional
mood. As I took a moment of silence to honor
the victims, I started to think how this tragedy
affected America's foreign policy in the subse-
quent years.
The terrorist attacks shed light on the fun-
damental problems of decisions made in an
effort to protect our national security. To take
action against the injustice done to the inno-
cent Americans, the government decided to
use invasive military measures. Hundreds of
billions of dollars were spent every year on mil-
itarism, and endless troops were sent to Iraq,
Afghanistan and the Arabian Peninsula. The
government seemed to make sure that every
last penny of our military spending possessed
as much hatred and desire for revenge as we
did on the day of the attacks.
These military actions were taken suppos-
edly to promote democratic ideals in militarily
weaker, politically more chaotic and less eco-
nomically stable countries. To the government
that made such decisions, it was only logical
to instill new political ideals in a community
after seizing military control of the communi-
ty. This logic was flawed, yet it was brilliantly
concealed by a number of excuses, creating a

delusion fueled by war propaganda that out-
right lied to the American people. The wars in
the Middle East were carried out for dubious
motives. Invading countries out of revenge
- which possibly caused today's preemptive
military mindset - as opposed to spending
that military money on defense to strengthen
the United States as a nation, is not beneficial
in attempting to protect national security.
Outrageously enough, the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan were, in my opinion, unconstitu-
tional. Even though Congress authorized the
use of military force in the Middle East, the
wars were never formally declared.
Not only are U.S. troops still in the Middle
East, but the government has not reduced
military spending. More money is still being
used to strengthen national defense than build
infrastructure, better the education system or
stimulate the economy. This huge amount of
money spent was borrowed from other coun-
tries - with China as the biggest lender.
We spent money we didn't have and spent
it on military invasions where American lives
were lost, allso we could promote democracy
in places where the people did not ask for
help. There has got to be something wrong
with this picture.
Kevin Tung is an LSA junior.

to offer. But this is also a time for
reflection - most notably, Tuesday's
eleventh anniversary of 9/11.
Our moments of meaningful
reflection are usually confined to just
a handful of designated days every
year. But we'd be much better off
if we reflected on our lives and the
world as a whole for 30 uninterrupt-
ed minutes every day.
In an era of constant multitask-
ing, it's refreshing to engage in deep
thought for a few minutes every
day without distractions from tech-
nology and social networks. As
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology Prof. Sherry Turkle wrote in
The NewYork Times in April, "these
days, social media continually asks us
what's 'on our mind,' but we have lit-
tle motivation to say something truly
self-reflective." Thirty minutes is
long enough to allow for meaningful
reflection, but not so long that there
isn't enough time to finish homework
or socialize with friends. Everyone
can find 30 free minutes in their day
if they cut out some time devoted to
using Facebook or surfing the Inter-
net. Introverts can silently reflect
on their own, while extroverts can
reflect aloud with their friends.
Engaging in this type of reflection
has been extremely valuable for me
throughout the past few days because

it has helped me begin to piece
together a broad conceptual frame-
work for my own life and the world
as a whole. Particularly during the
school yearwe get so preoccupied
with due dates and socializing that
we become completely consumed by
the situations immediately affecting
our lives. As a result, many ofus don't
frequently think deeply about our
greatest life ambitions, the current
state of our world or the world we
would like to see.
The process of reflecting on this
large framework is like writing a
paper for class. As I write, I frequent-
ly stop and ask myself one simple
question: "What is the point of my
paper?" After I'm able to mentally
summarize the entire paper in one
or two short sentences, the writ-
ing process becomes much easier.
Everything else - body paragraphs,
specific points, individual quotes - is
simply supporting evidence that fits
into the overarching framework of
my paper.
Obviously, life is much more com-
plicated and inherently contradic-
tory than a paper's thesis statement.
But we can still come up with some
basic framework for our lives. Do
we want to bring people joy? Do we
want to fight social inequalities? Do
we want to push the boundaries of
existingknowledgeWhen we reflect
and come up with some kind of over-
arching framework for our lives
- even if it's imperfect - decisions
that used to be much more difficult
simply become supporting evidence:
career choices, lifestyle choices, class
choices and so on. As a result, the
process of evaluating our own lives
and the world around us becomes a
little easier. And it isn't good enough
to conceptualize this framework only
a handful of times every year. Like
in classes, constant repetition and
re-evaluation is crucial for remem-
bering and understanding our life

philosophy on a deep level.
But we shouldn't reflect on just
our own lives every day. We also
need to think about how the world as
a whole appears to us - and what we
want the world to look like. Is there
too much inequality in our society?
Do we want a well-educated citi-
zenry? Do we want vitriol or civility
to dominate our political discourse?
Set aside 30
minutes for
clarity and
perspective.

We don't need to come up with
the answers to all of our questions
in one day. But we need to be think-
ing about these kinds of questions
every day. Reflection gives us a clar-
ity of mind and purpose that can
easily be lost in the immediacy and
constant distractions of 21st-cen-
tury life. If we consistently remind
ourselves of our evolving, matur-
ing perspective on our lives and the
world, we'll be able to use our limit-
ed time much more effectively and
our experiences will be even more
fulfilling. With a broad framework
in mind, we actively steer our lives
- and the world around us - in the
direction we want, instead of sim-
ply being dragged along.
This school year has just begun.
Let's take some time to reflect on
where we've been, where we are
right now and where we're going
- even if we can't figure it out in
a day. Facebook can be remain un-
checked for a few more minutes.

Ballnik highlighted how
even though "Anything Goes" is
known for its noteworthy dance
routines, he wanted to illustrate
how there is so much more to the
dances than the rigorous move-
ments performed.
"I was very adamant about
having the dance tell a story or
display something about the
character," he said. "I think
that's what a lot of people fall
through with, they just put
dance on stage for dance's sake."
Ballnik emphasizes that, even
more than the plot, it's Cole Por-
ter's songs that showcase the
intricacies of each character and
demonstrate the inner strug-
gles they are experiencing. For
instance, "I Get A Kick Out Of
You" is the first musical number
that introduces Reno Sweeney.
The song shows her not only as
an audacious figure who domi-
nates the crowd, but details her
vulnerabilities, suggesting that
she is also in love with a man she
cannot have.
Much as the title of the show
suggests, Ballnik made clear
that life should be enjoyed and
not taken too seriously.
"I want them humming the
tunes when they leave," Ballnik
said. "This isn't Stephen Sond-
heim, and it isn't Shakespeare,
this is 'Anything Goes."'

MusIc NOTEBOOK
In defense of Waka Flocka

By ANDREW ECKHOUS
Daily Arts Writer
Why do I have to defend my
loveofWakaFlocka Flame? When
I divulge my best-kept secret, why
do I feel obligated to add the self-
flagellating caveat, "I know Waka
Flocka sucks, but ... ?" Even my
compatriots who listen to rappers
guiltyofsullyingthe name of"hip
hop" are quick to roast, zing and
scoff at my heretical declaration
that "2 Chainz actually isn't that
bad."
Now, before anyone gets any
ideas, I'm not claiming "Hard in
Da Paint" is rhythmic ambrosia
or comparing 2 Chainz to Inspec-
tah Deck - I'm just saying peo-
ple should take their music less
seriously. As a recovering music
elitist, I know better than any-
one that it's easy (and fun) to tell
someone that their favorite musi-
cian is a human pile of shit with
shit for brains and shit for music.
"Oh,you don'tlistento Wu-Tang/
J Dilla / Kendrick Lamar?" "Your
favorite OutKast album is The
Love Below?" "You paid how much
to see Drake live?" "You must not
be a person worthy of my time."
But I'm a reformed man now.
I've seen the error of my ways,
and I know why the caged thug
raps. Simply put, the music serves
a purpose. It's crude and upfront
with misogyny, and has no doubts
about what it wants to be. It para-
doxically combines willful igno-
rance of everything commanded
by God with ostentatious gold
crosses and scripture tats. These
rappers effortlessly maintain
couldn't-care-less attitudes while
retaininghordesofmarketing and
PR professionals. It's a life of con-
tradictions, but if you confronted
them about it they'd just shrug it
off and take a hit from the ever-
presentblunt in their hand.
Let's be frank - the type of
lyrically challenged party rap
I'm referring to will never be
considered "good." If a thousand

It was Halloween, and I was
visiting a friend at awarm, idyl-
lic southern university. I was
standing on a balcony dressed
as Crocodile Dundee, more
than buzzed, surrounded by
costumed peers gyrating to
ear-bleedingly loud bro-step in
every direction. The scene was
so picturesque it could have
been an "I'm Shmacked" video
- I was smack dab in the mid-
dle of a college student's Eden.
Like those sorority T-shirts on
football Saturdays, I tried des-
perately to RAGE RAGE RAGE.
And yet, all that resulted was me
awkwardly nodding in a sort of
half dance, half neck-snapping
jig to the loud techno as I franti-
cally scanned the crowd for my
friend, all the time clinging to
my (very empty) Natty Light like
a lifeline.
After a while, I mercifully
found myself back at the bar with
my friend. He looked at me oddly
for a moment, and then blurted
out the sentiment that would
provoke the creation of this very
article almost a year later.
"You can't Rage, can you?" he
asked.
Indignant and proud (and
totally bullshitting), I scram-
bled to defend my Big Ten party
school honor.
"Psh, are you kidding? Of
course I can Rage! I go to Michi-
gan!" I lamely protested, embar-
rassed that he had picked up on
my obvious discomfort.
The next day, as I flew north
of the Mason-Dixon line back to
Detroit, I pondered the notion of
"Raging." Why didn't I enjoy it?
As much as I hated to admit it, my
friend was right - I was not into
standing on a balcony holdingmy
beer up high, toasting the Gods
of Rage. But I did like partying.
Wherein lies the difference?
It got me thinking. What is
Raging, anyway? Isn't it just par-
tying ... intensely? Or is there a
variable that separates it from
regular old partying?

Insurgent attack on base kills
three, destroys NATO chopper

*I

Additional suicide
bomber attack kills
five people
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -
Afghan insurgents bombarded a
U.S. base and destroyed a NATO
helicopter, killing three Afghan
intelligence employees, officials
said Tuesday. There were also
NATO personnel aboard and
wounded, the coalition said with-
out providing further details.
Separately, a teenage suicide
bomber on Tuesday walked into
a shop in western Afghanistan
and blew himself up, killing five
people, Afghan officials said.
The bombing and the strike at
Bagram Air Field outside Kabul
came as U.S. and its allied mili-
tary forces marked the 11th anni-
versary ofthe Sept.11, 2001, terror
attacks with a tribute to the more
than 3,000 foreign troops killed
since the invasion of Afghanistan
- including about 2,000 mem-
bers of the U.S. military.
The attacks were a reminder
that the Afghan war launched
less than a month after 9/11 con-
tinues to rage, with insurgents
waging a ceaseless campaign

against the U.S.-led NATO
coalition and the Afghan gov-
ernment.
"Eleven years on from that
day there should be no doubt
that our dedication to this com-
mitment, that commitment that
was seared into our souls that
day so long ago, remains strong
and unshaken, " said Marine
Gen John Allen, the top com-
mander of U.S. and coalition
troops, at a ceremony at NATO's
Kabul headquarters.
"Today we remember the vic-
tims here in Afghanistan who
have suffered so horribly at the
hands of al-Qaida and the Tali-
ban and other terrorists," he
said. "Perhaps more significant
to all of us at this ceremony,
today we remember the pre-
cious soldiers and civilians of all
nations lost in Afghanistan since
that day of infamy in 2001."
Allen hailed the troops fight-
ing in Afghanistan as the "next
greatest generation," a reference
to those who fought in World War
II.
"A generation that has been at
war for 11 years, the longest war
in most of our nations' modern
histories. Many of you standing

here today are on your second,
third, fourth, and sometimes
even fifth tours in this fight,"
Allen said.
After the short ceremony, he
swore in eight members of the
U.S. military, who decided to re-
enlist on the anniversary of the
attacks.
"I think it is a great honor to
be able to re-enlist on September
11," said SFC Isaac D. Engle, 30,
from Salem, Oregon. A member
of the Oregon National Guard,
the 10-year veteran was heading
home in less than a week after
serving a year in Afghanistan.
The attack on the sprawl-
ing Bagram Air Field occurred
around 10 p.m. Monday. Mili-
tants occasionally fire mortars
or rockets at Bagram, but the
attacks usually cause little or no
damage.
The Taliban claimed respon-
sibility for the attack.
"Four rounds hit," coalition
spokesman Army Maj. Adam
Wojack said, adding that it was
unclear whether they were
rockets or mortars. "One of the
rounds hit the helicopter and
started a fire, which destroyed
it."

the hills west of Wenatchee, a
fruit capital on the banks of the
Columbia River.
More than 150 homes were
evacuated due to the fire burning
about 140 miles east of Seattle.
About 160 firefighters from
across the state gathered to help
fight the blaze, which covered
1,000 acres. Resident Shannon
Grosdidier and her four daugh-
ters delivered oatmeal cookies
to several stationed at the end of
her street Monday night.
"The wind has died down,
which is good," she said. "But
I've got the photo albums in
the car and our overnight bags
packed."
Only a shed has been lost near
Wenatchee, and no injuries have
been reported at what appeared
to be the most-threatening of
numerous wildfires in the state
that were sparked by lightning
Saturday.
In Montana, Sawtooth Fire
spokesman Gregg DeNitto with
the U.S. Forest Service said
there was no word on when res-
idents there might be allowed
to return. The fire exploded
over the past two days from
just over 1 square mile to more
than 6, although no houses were
reported lost.
DeNitto said most threatened
houses were stilla half-mile to a
mile from the fire's edge.
An estimated 1,000 people
live within the evacuated area,
although Ravalli County Com-
missioner Suzy Foss said not all
of them left. Of those who fled,
most were staying with friends,

relatives or acquaintances, Foss
said. Only a couple of residents
spent the night at a Red Cross
shelter set up in Hamilton for
evacuees, DeNitto said.
Firefighters got help from the
weather in Wyoming, where
cooler temperatures and calmer
winds bought time to put more
people and equipment into
action around two large fires.
As many as 750 homes were
threatened by the large wildfire
near Casper. Some 400 people
were evacuated from 150 homes.
Firefighters on Tuesday
planned to deploy more than a
dozen aircraft against the blaze,
including two air tankers and
seven helicopters.
In central Oregon, hazard-
ous smoke settled in Sisters for
about six hours Tuesday morn-
ing as crews battled a forest fire
burning on about 4,300 acres
southwest of town. Sisters has
about 2,000 residents and is a
center for tourists and outdoor
recreation.
The Oregon Department of
Environmental Quality said
atmospheric conditions - atem-
perature inversion - could mean
poor air quality in the mornings
through Saturday.
The fire began Sunday in the
Three Sisters Wilderness area.
Residents of a subdivision west
of Sisters have been warned that
they might have to evacuate, but
the fire has not yet advanced on
populated areas.
Blazes have scorched more
than 8.1 million acres across the
West so far this year, up from
the 10-year average of 6.1 million
acres, according to the National
Interagency Fire Center.
In Utah, more than 100 proper-
ty owners filed a lawsuit Tuesday
in state district court blaming a
utility for one of the state's largest
wildfires this year.
The lawsuit against Rocky
Mountain Power alleges arcing
between power transmission
lines sparked the 75-square-
mile Wood Hollow Fire, which
destroyed 52 cabins or houses
in central Utah and left one man
dead in June.
Rocky Mountain Power told
The Associated Press the law-
suit is unnecessary because the
utility is pursuing out-of-court
settlements with dozens of fami-
lies. The company has admitted
no fault.

ter."
However, the brother of former
U.S. president George W. Bush
and the son of former president
George H. W. Bush stressed the
importance of limiting criticism
to policies, not people.
"I've had a front row seat
watching presidents and I don't
like it when they attacked my
brother, I don't like it when they
attacked my dad," Bush said.
"Campaigns should be about big
things and big ideas. I don't like it
when we personalize it and trivi-
alize it."
Bush also criticized several
tenets of the president's econom-
ic policy and contrasted him with
Romney, whom Bush said has
much needed business acumen.
"Mitt Romney was made for

Jankowski said the purpose of
the event was to honor the vic-
tims in an apolitical atmosphere,
even though the Republicans
sponsored the event.
"This event is supposed to be
non-partisan, it's not about any
human division that we have, so
it shouldn't be about our political
affiliation, race or our gender or
anything like that," Jankowski
said. "We're all Americans and
we're all affected by it."
LSA senior Sarah Huston, a
naval ROTC member who also
contributed to planning the
event, said she was impressed
with the level of support the
event received from students
and the ROTC in the past two
years.
POSITIONS

means they will have to be offi-
cially approved next week, as
an effort to prevent any further
postponements in student gov-
ernment business and provide an
additional week to vet the nomi-
nees.
"What that means is that we
will be approving this person
for one week to give the execu-
tive nominations committee
more time to write their recom-
mendation," he said. "(But) that
will allow these people to begin
their work right away."
Parikh added that CSG's lack
of an executive board made it
difficult to reach out to stu-
dents, particularly freshmen,
during Welcome Week. Howev-
er, he said CSG will continue to
make an effort to connect with
students they missed now that
the positions have been appoint-
ed.
"I think through our social
media efforts and our new
engagement strategies we'll
make up on all that lost time," he
said.
Parikh said he felt strongly
about the qualifications of the
nominees, and Osborn and Han
spoke to the assembly about their
candidacies. Kibler had a written

statement read aloud, as he was
not able to attend the meeting.

this job," he said. "He's a practical
man; he's actually done things in
the real world."
Bush said specifically the argu-
ment surrounding wealth distri-
bution is flawed.
"The debate shouldn't be that
we want to redistribute wealth.
The debate ought to be how do
you create a climate where more
prosperity and more wealth is
created where everybody has a
chance to be successful," Bush
said.
He warned attendees that
increasing the government's debt
and continuing to borrow from
countries such as China would
lead to hyperinflation and high
interest rates, crippling America's
future leaders.
"It is possible for the first time
in American history, the next
generation will have less oppor-
tunities than what was afforded
the previous one," he said. "I

know that you all know that that's
not the kind of America that we
want."
He added that the Obama
administration has made it chal-
lenging for Americans to success
through unnecessary regula-
tions and the implementation of
policies that fail to encourage
growth.
"The rest of the world is not
nearly as complacent as we are,"
Bush said. "And it's time to have
political leaders that lift our spir-
its up and bring the energy and
vitality to making policy so that
we can restore American great-
ness."
He ended the 10-minute
speech by urging volunteers and
supporters to continue cam-
paigning for the final two months
of the presidential election.
"This is going to be a close elec-
tion," he said. "Michigan is going
to be a close election."


"S wasn't sure how the dona-
tions were going to go over and
it actually went over really well,"
Huston said. "We raised a couple
hundred dollars last year, and a
lot of it was students. They've
been very supportive and it's
nice to see that."
Huston added that about
half of her battalion visited the
memorial over the course of the
day to assist with the event and
pay their respects.
LSA junior Russ Hayes, the
internal vice chair of the College
Republicans, said the vigil was
designed as a time for individual
consideration of the attacks and
the people they influenced.
"I've seen a lot of folks stand-
ing and reflecting and I think
that's the important thing,"
Hayes said. "It's a great opportu-
nity to remember."
LSA senior Talia Horwitz

visited the memorial on her
way to class during the day and
returned for the vigil Tues-
day night. She said the display
inspired her to give more con-
sideration to those who were and
are still influenced by the events
of 9/11.
"I've never really taken a
moment to think about who has
been affected, but right now I
want to take that time to reflect,"
Horwitz said.
LSA sophomore John Borger,
an Army ROTC member, attend-
ed the vigil Tuesday night. He
said it was an important time to
show appreciation for members
of the U.S. military who still
serve overseas.
"It's important for us to
remember what we all woke to
that morning, what the soldiers
sacrifice for us day in and day
out," Borger said.

VOTER ID
From Page1A
times, votes as someone else or
votes despite knowing that he or
she is ineligible.
Fred Woodhams, a spokesman
for the Secretary of State, said
the ID requirement has helped
non-citizens confused by elec-
tion laws avoid deportation by
restricting them from breaking
U.S. law by voting.
Woodhams referenced a
Kalamazoo man who allegedly
ran into difficulty obtaining U.S.
citizenship because he illegally
voted in the past. He cited such
examples as part of the reasoning
for the push for the citizenship
question.
"Non-citizens who cast a ballot
can face serious legal problems,
including deportation," Wood-
hamssaid. "At the very least it will
cause problems if they ever decide
to become naturalized citizens."
He noted that the absentee
law vetoed by Snyder would have
made election laws more consis-
tent.
"We know that there were
some non-citizens that registered
to vote, and these people may not
be aware that they're not legally
able to cast a ballot in Michigan,"
Woodhams said. "The (citizen-
ship) check box is a simple way
to make sure everyone is aware
of what the state and federal laws
are."
Opponents of stricter voting
laws, including Robert McCann,
a spokesman for Michigan Sen-
ate Democrats, say stricter ID
requirements will adversely dis-
enfranchise minorities and the
poorbecause theydo nothave the
resources to obtain valid photo
identification.
"The voter ID laws being
pushed by Secretary of State Ruth
Johnson and legislative Republi-
cans are based solely on a political
agenda, not some phony altruistic
goal of fighting election fraud,"
McCann wrote in a statement.
McCann added that he believes
the lawswould do little to combat
voter fraud in the state.

"These laws are written and
lobbied for by extreme special
interest groups across the coun-
try who have no shame about
taking away our most fundamen-
tal right to vote in order to fulfill
their political agenda," he wrote.
"Thankfully court after court
has ruled them unconstitutional
along the way."
However, Woodhams dis-
missed the notion that the laws
would disenfranchise voters and
said the citizenship box is a "very
simple, easy to answer question."
"It's a simple yes or no ques-
tion. People certainly know if
they're a United States citizen or
not," Woodhams said. "It's not at
all confusing to anyone. The only
people that are affectedby this are
people who should not be voting."
Twelve states have passed
stricter identification laws since
2011 alone, according to the
National Conference of State
Legislatures. Pennsylvania's Act
18 was recently thrust into the
national spotlight for being con-
sidered by some organizations,
including the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Col-
ored People, as especially harsh.
Under the law, Pennsylva-
nia voters must present a valid
driver's license, military ID, col-
lege ID, a local or county govern-
ment employee ID or a photo ID
from a state health care facility.
In addition, a valid ID must have
an expiration date, a feature some
universities do not include on
their cards.
Pennsylvania's law was chal-
lenged in court in August, but was
ultimately upheld. It will be tried
in front of the state's Supreme
Court on Thursday.
The Brennan Center for Jus-
tice, a non-partisan public policy
and law institute at the New
York University School of Law,
reported that as much as 10
percent of the nation's popula-
tion does not have, and will not
receive, the necessary documen-
tation needed to vote under new,
more restrictive laws, such as the
Pennsylvania statute. In some
minority groups, that percentage
is believed to be even higher.

Additionally, News21, a stu-
dent-journalism initiative at
Arizona State University's jour-
nalism school, released a study
in August that found voter fraud
investigations often find little evi-
dence of actual fraud.
The study found just 10 inci-
dents of voter impersonation,
which indicates that fraud might
occur once for every 15 million
voters.
News21 did note, however,.
that absentee voter fraud is much
more common than voter imper-
sonation fraud. Among absentee
ballots analyzed, 491 cases were
identified as fraudulent.
Voter fraud and identification
laws have become divisive issues
in this year's presidential elec-
tion. LSA junior Alexandra Brill,
chair of the University's chapter
of College Democrats, said the
group believes it's important that
all citizens are able to cast their
ballot for the candidate of their
choice.
"We applaud Governor Sny-
der's decision to veto this year's
repressive voter-ID laws in Mich-
igan and fear that other states'
recent efforts to pass similar
bills would prevent citizens from
exercising their right to vote,"
Brill said.
LSA junior Russ Hayes, the
internal vice chair of the Uni-
versity's chapter of College
Republicans, wrote in an e-mail
interview that voter identifica-
tion is an issue that transcends
party politics. However, he noted
many opponents fail to see the
importance of stricter policies
in ensuring legitimacy in the
upcoming election.
"As evidenced by the Gover-
nor's veto of this summer's voter
ID measure, people on both sides
of the aisle have fair disagree-
ments on a.divisive issue," Hayes
wrote. "What we do know is that
you need a photo ID to drive, go
through airport security, and get
into Costco. To paint support for
reasonable photo ID laws as sup-
port for voter suppression goes a
little overboard - what it really is
is concern about the integrity and
validity of our elections."


student general counsel, have yet

In addition to nominating
executive positions, the assembly
also voted on the chair and vice-
chair positions of the resolutions
committee and the ethics com-
mittee.
LSA senior Andrea Alajbe-
govic of OurMichigan defeated
LSA"sophomore Sarah Goomar
of youMICH for the vice chair
position on the executive nomi-
nations committee in the semes-
ter's first competitive election for
a committee position.
Business from last spring's
election was discussed yet again
as the assembly resolved stale-
mates for assembly represen-
tative seats in the Rackham
Graduate School and the Taub-
man College of Architecture and
Urban Planning.
When none of the students
involved in either tie attended to
indicate their interest in holding
an assembly position, the seats
were declared vacant.
A second Rackham assembly
seat was also made vacant after
Jennifer Dibbern resigned from
her position as the vice chair of
the executive nominations com-
mittee and as assembly represen-
tative.
According to fellow Rack-
ham student and representative
Patrick O'Mahen, a former col-
umnist for The Michigan Daily,
Dibbern is no longer a student at
the University.
Dibbern, a two-term represen-

tative, was previously dismissed
from her position as a Graduate
Student Research Assistant in
the College of Engineering last
fall, before changing her academ-
ic discipline.
The Graduate Employees
Organization, the union for
graduate student instructors and
graduate student staff assistants
at the University, organized a
rally and press conference in
January alleging that Dibbern
was dismissed due to her involve-
ment in GEO.
While two of the 10 Rackham
representative seats have been
declared vacant, O'Mahen said
only two Rackham representa-
tives attend meetings and just
three Rackham students regis-
tered to run for the open seats in
the March 2012 elections.
While six of Rackham's repre-
sentatives do not go to meetings,
their seats have not been vacated,
which raises the number of rep-
resentatives required to meet
quorum - defined as half the
number of standing representa-
tives. If the seats are not vacated
soon, the assembly could have
difficulties making quorum and
holding meetings.
In an interview after the
meeting, CSG assembly speak-
er Michael Proppe, a Business
junior, said in the upcoming
weeks the assembly will look
to vacate assembly seats whose
holders do not attend meetings.
Proppe added that currently,
several Rackham representa-
tives have already acquired eight
absences and they will be eligible
for removal by accruing four
more.
Despite a handful of early
vacancies and soon-to-be vacan-
cies, Proppe said he was con-
fident that attaining quorum
would not be a problem this
year. He added that representa-
tives who have already missed
meetings have typically been in
contact with him regarding the
absences.

He explained that while his
second project wasn't ideal, he
still had enjoyed his experience
traveling to China.
"The techniques I learned for
electron microscopywere all new
to me, too," he said.
LSA junior Mary Hemmeter
also traveled to Hefei, where she
researched String Theory, an idea
based on the notion that elemen-
tary particles, such as electrons,
exist as one-dimensional, oscil-
lating objects, like the strings of
aguitar.
Though Hemmeter did not
face equipment struggles while

researching, she said she strug-
gled to keep up with the gradu-
ate-level work in the program as
an undergraduate student.
"They didn't really have a proj-
ect for someone at my level," she
said. "And I would ask for help,
but the professor wasn't always
available."
She added that the graduate
students were friendly, but often
had poor English skills or didn't
know enough about String The-
ory to help her. Despite her diffi-
culties, she said she still enjoyed
her visit to China.
"I didn't get a good 'research'
experience, but I did learn
things," Hemmeter said.
She added that the additional
activities provided by the Uni-

versity particularly added to her
experience. Hemmeter chose to
partake in optional Mandarin
classes and also enjoyed travel-
ing to places such as the Huang-
shan Mountains in eastern
China.
Wagner and Hemmeter agreed
that transportation within China
was challenging, and both resort-
ed to taking pictures of Chinese
characters to communicate their
desired destinations to taxi driv-
ers.
While the students experi-
enced difficulties with their
research projects, Hemmeter
said she was satisfied with the
program as a whole.
"I think it's worth doing," she
said.

Running back
a has distinct style,



'extremely elusive'
in the backfield
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Mike Cox can fly, but you
-should see him on skates.
"Fastest seventh grader on
skates in the world or something
like that," offered fifth-year
senior center Elliott Mealer.
Well, something.like that.
Cox, the Massachusetts start-
ing running back, spent four sea-
sons at Michigan before using the
NCAA's graduate transfer rule
,to spend a season with the Min-
utemen. He tallied 177 rushing
yards and two touchdowns on 19
attempts as a Wolverine.
Cox doesn't explain this much
anymore, but football was far
from his firstlove.
"Hockey," Cox said with a
laugh during a phone interview
Tuesday. "That used to be my
sport back in the day."
It was more than just his game
it was his specialty. At 12 years
old, the fleet-footed right winger
traveled to an East Coast-West
Coast all-star tournament. He
scored seven goals, won the fast-
"est-skater award and was named
tournament MVP.

Massachusetts coach Charley
Molnar has already slotted Cox as
the starter, after the back gained
32 yards on 20 carries in two
starts this fall.
"It doesn't matter if we're
playing Michigan or the Detroit
Lions, this guy believes in himself
and believes in the people around
him," Molnar said. "I think that's
just how he's wired. I'm glad to
have him."
Molnar said Cox has "assimi-
lated himself" well at Massachu-
setts, going from a powerhouse
program to a fledgling football
team in its first season at the Divi-
sion-I FBS level.
"He's a popular guy," Molnar
said. "If we voted for captains
today I don't know that he would
win but he would be a high vote
getter.
"And maybe he looks at it as
'going home,' (but) all I know is
that he has real excitement in his
eyes this week."
Hoke and the players were all
quick to say that they were root-
ing for Cox, just not this weekend.
"You step in between those
white lines and it's another oppo-
nent," said redshirt junior safety
Thomas Gordon. "We were all
happy for Mike to get this oppor-
tunity to play, and we're looking
forward to playing him."
Cox was listed as a 6-foot run-
ning back for Michigan last sea-
son. Massachusetts now has him
listed at 6-foot-3.
Who knows, maybe -he's -on-
skates again.

at 6-foot and doesn't quite have
breakaway speed.
But Borges has learned quickly
this season that Robinson has
more options than most people
think.
"Our wide receiver position,
believe it or not, is a little deeper
than we had anticipated, particu-
larly with (junior wide receiver)
Devin Gardner doing what he's
done," Borges said. "And (fresh-
man Devin Funchess) is a highly
skilled kid, yet he is a not a com-
plete tight end yet.... He can go get
the ball, runs very well for a tight
end, and when he gets a little big-
ger and stronger, I think he can be
a complete player."
Gardner and Funchess were
Robinson's top targets against Air
Force last weekend, combining

for 169 yards and both touchdown
receptions. Moreover, the two are
6-foot-4 and 6-foot-5, respectively,
and have made a habit of catching
balls over defensive backs who
where smaller than them.
In a way, they did a solid job on
Saturday of replacing Heming-
way's tremendous jump-ball abil-
ity from a season ago.
"Devin Garder, you'll see, that
catch he made in the end zone, a
smaller guy may not have caught
that ball, so (height) helps," Borg-
es said. "It helps and it doesn't
matter who the quarterback is -
they love those nice, big targets
where they don't have to throwit
perfect every time. They still have
a chance to make a play."
SHOW ME THE RHYTHM:
Sophomore running back Fitz
Toussaint's return to the lineup
following his one-game suspen-
sion was underwhelming, to say
the least. He only picked up seven
yards on eight carries. Much of
the problem could be the offensive'
line, but Borges was quick to point
out something else on Tuesday.
"A couple times we missed a
couple reads where he should have
gotten the ball and didn't," Borges
said. "One of them the quarter-
back took off for a 79-yard touch-
down, so it's hard to say that he
was wrong. But Fitz might have
been able to run that one, too.
Denard will tell you that."
So, maybe Toussaint could
pickedup 86 yards on nine carries,
had Robinson handed the ball off
on the second play of Michigan's
first drive of the game. Robinson,
instead, ran for 218 yards on 20
carries.

"The staff at Counseling & Psychological Services would like to make
a strong statement of support for the personal statement written by Ms.
Kaitlin Williams on Sep. 3, 2012, ' struggle with mental illness.' In fact, we'd
like to say more than 'support.' We would like to acknowledge the strength
and the courage it takes to speak and to write on the difficult topic of what
it is like to live with mental illness as a student at Michigan. Through this act
of strength and courage, and the experience it represents, along with count-
less other stories of Michigan students' challenges and successes with men-
tal health, we change the world when we speak to counteract the silence."
-Todd D. Sevig, director of CAPS
"Hang in there Kaitlin. Whatever the diagnosis, itcan be managed with
meds and time spent consulting with professionals who can guide you
to a greater understanding of yourself. Your chosen life endeavor will be
enhanced. You will bring to it the experience of suffering which has allowed
you to learn and grow and become a much wiser person."

LSA senior Lily Gerasymchuk, who also
deleted her Facebook to prepare for the MCAT,
noted that being Facebook-free sometimes
produced the anxiety associated with FOMO.
"Not having a Facebook also decreased the
numberoffriends that I interacted with,"she
said. "Only my close friends took the time to
contact me through other means."
But there's another form of FOMO, one
that results from receiving too much infor-
mation on what's going on.
All it takes is someone else's photo album
titled "SUMMER 2012 <3" to feel like you've
spent more than enough time scrolling
through the life experiences of acquaintanc-
es, your own timeline becoming static and
pale under the glow of the laptop screen.
"Facebook does make me feel a bit lonely,"
Gerasymchuk said. "While I'm bored over
the summer, I get jealous of people explor-
ing Europe and doing cool things while I'm
just stuck at home."
Great. So when you have a Facebook, you
see what you're missing out on. When you
don't have a Facebook, you imagine what
you're missing out on.
Miss Lonelyhearts
Rosen posits that there's a chance that
Facebook could act as a sort of protective
sealant against the ravages of loneliness.
"If you are lonely or sad, then having more
Facebook friends will make youless lonely most
likely because you have more options of people
to talk to for support and empathy," he said.

the summer become increasingly plugged-in.
For me, Facebook had become a significant
way to not become lonely. Even though my
cell phone was almost always attached to my
hip - and was a perfectly viable option of
contacting me - Facebook was preferred.
Stephen Marche, a Canadian writer who
has written multiple articles on Facebook,
didn't buy Rosen's claims regarding Face-
book's ability to decrease loneliness in his
latest article in The Atlantic.
"We meet fewer people. We gather less.
And when we gather, our bonds are less
meaningful and less easy," Marche wrote.
The only thing that can decrease loneli-
ness, Marche said in an interview, is face-to-
face contact with your fellow human beings.

I've come to terms with the fact that I
don't need Facebook to stay up to date with a

Coleman said.
But, at the end of the day, when she
makes up her mind about something,
she's unlikely to reconsider, no matter
how popular or unpopular a decision
may be.
"She's not someone who's going to
waffle on decisions she's made," Han-
lon said.
And under her management, the
University has been forced to make a
series of tough choices.
The University has cut $235 million
in costs from the general fund budget
over the past decade, and it expects
to eliminate another $120 million by
2017. Hanlon said, adding that most of
the cuts have been kept away from the
academic enterprises.
The savings have been widelv
publicized from changing employee
benefits to the consolidation of infor-
mation technologies.
"We are so much more lean and
efficient than we were 10 years ago,"
Hanlon said.
Valued at $7.8 billion as of June 30,
2011, the University's endowment has
more than doubled under the manage-
ment of Coleman's financial team. Its
annual payout has also increased.

And it's even more expensive for out-
of-state and international students.
Coleman has previously expressed
her desire to see more non-resident

Courant said. "She pays attention to
things. She compliments you when
you do things well, she lets you know
if she doesn't think you're doing
things well. And she's very much of
the model of: 'When in doubt, call."'
Coleman meets weekly with the
University's executive officers to dis-
cuss the issues facing the University,
and she tries to hear as many opinions
as possible before making a decision.
"In my leadership style, I found that
putting issues on the table and making
people feel comfortable, whether they
agree or disagree, and to state their
case and to make their argument, that
we get better decisions in the end."

the upcomngfundraisingpusn.
But the specter of the end of Cole-
man's presidency is hanging over
the planning process. Her contract
expires in 2014, and she said she
doesn't plan on staying on longer.
"It is my expectation that I will go
on and do something differently in
two years," she said.
Her dozen years at the University's
helm will make her the longest ten-
ured president in nearly 40 years.
And as the University prepares for
a presidential transition, it'll be up to
that person, whoever they may be, to
set the University's priorities for the
coming years.
The budgetary challenges Coleman
has dealt with show no signs of abat-
ing and the next president will have to
find a way to generate revenue.
Though there will be challenges,
Coleman said she relishes the oppor-
tunity to tackle them head on.
"You're always going to have new
challenges," Coleman said. "That's one
of the things that's so exciting about
being in a university community, espe-
cially at a place like Michigan."
With the foundation Coleman's
laid, it's up to another advocate to lay
down the bricks.

"We have capacity, and these stu-

Coleman said at the Mackinac Policy
Conference in May. "They actually
add tremendously to the economy of

But since the cost of attending the
University has increased, many are
worried that the culture of the insti-
tution, with more higher-income and
out-of-state students, is changing.
"The out-of-state price has gotten
so high that those kids generally come
from families that are generally pretty
affluent," Deitch said.
What's next?
The University is planning to
launch its next capital campaign late
next year and May said financial aid
will be one of its several major focus-
es. More than $500 million was raised
in private support in the last cam-

hoping to top that this time around.

But as efficiency has improved over
the past decade, increased tuition
rates have been a part of the budget-

amount of financial aid the University
awards has increased.
The cost of attendance at the Uni-

2002, it cost an in-state LSA freshman
approximately $7,300 for a full year's
tuition. Now, it costs an LSA fresh-
man from Michigan approximately
$12,800 to attend to the University.

cheerleader for the institution, having
time and again stressed the gravity of the
funding difficulties facing the University
to nearly anyone who's willing to listen.
Her insistence has paid off with Uni-
versity donors. In fact, fundraising may
be the one area where Coleman has had
the greatest individual impact.
May has worked in development for
more than 30 years and says, quite sin-
cerely, that Coleman has been one of the
most "effective presidents in the country,

Every student gets their moment. Ner-
vous freshman or class president, you'll

For Mary Sue Coleman, the Universi-
ty's first female president, face time mat-
ters. It's her bread and butter.
It doesn't matter if she's talking to
students or a prospective million-dollar
donor. Somehow she manages to charm
everyone.
"When Mary Sue builds relationships,
they're just not glad-handing. They're
really genuine relationships," said Jerry
May, the University's vice president for
development.
Over the past decade, she's used that
charm to become the University's best
advocate, promoting the University and
what it stands for. With her contract
expiring in two years, both Coleman and
the University are preparing for their
next chapter.
This fall is Coleman's tenth at the Uni-
versity. During her tenure, the University
has faced well-documented budget chal-
lenges - last year, in inflation-adjusted
dollars, the University received $166 mil-
lion less than it did a decade ago from the
state.
But Coleman has remained an tireless

my job."
While some may feel uncomfortable
asking for such large sums of money,
Coleman says she relishes making pitch-
es to donors. She said development work
is a direct way for her to help the Uni-
versity.
"I'm not bashful," Coleman said, laugh-
ing.
Nor does she go unrewarded for her
efforts. According to The Chronicle of
Higher Education, she made more than
$845,000 in 2011, making her the fifth
highest-paid public-college president in
the country.
A track record
Before she arrived at the University
in 2002, Coleman had already built a
reputation as an able university leader.
During her seven years as president
of the University of Iowa, annual fun-
draising at Iowa climbed from $82 mil-
lion to $172 million, while research
funding nearly doubled to $300 million.
The University's Board of Regents,
who led the search for a new president,
was looking for someone with a proven
track record of leading a large public
research university, and the choice of
Coleman was the obvious choice, Regent
Laurence Deitch (D-Bingham Farms),
who chaired the search committee, said.
"We wanted someone, at that time,
who was a sitting president," Deitch said,
adding that all the candidates the Univer-
sity considered were current presidents at

basketball program when Coleman first
arrived.
And the Life Sciences Institute, which
was after Lee Bollinger, Coleman's pre-
decessor, was also in flux. Its initial
co-directors left at the same time as Bol-
linger, and Coleman - a biochemist by
trade - was forced to ensure that the LSI,
which is aimed at collaborative research
in the various life science disciplines,
would be completed successfully.
But the struggles over the University's
budget and its annual state funding have
been, arguably, the most significant battle
fought by Coleman, the board and other
administrators as they confront what has
become an existential threat to the Univer-
sity's status as an elite public university.
Managing the University
As a leader, Coleman affords those who
work for her the independence to solve
problems. Both University Provost Phil
Hanlon, and former provost Paul Cou-
rant, who is now the University's Dean
of Libraries, agree that Coleman allows
great latitude, but is also very accessible
to discuss any issues.
"I always had, as provost, extremely

by far, in fundraising."
Because the connections Coleman
makes with donors are so genuine, they're
more willing to donate to the University,
sources close to her say.
"She just makes every donor feel spe-
cial and makes them feel important to the
future of the University," said Rich Rogel,
a University supporter who has made
multi-million dollar donations to the Uni-
versity and who chaired the Michigan
Difference campaign - the high-profile
fundraising effort that ran from 2004 to
2008 and raised $3.2 billion for the Uni-
versity.
As a result of the Michigan Differ-
ence campaign, more than 150 named
professorships were created, $550 mil-
lion in financial aid was donated and
more than $490 million for new and
upgraded facilities was also contribut-
ed, including now-iconic buildings like
Ross School of Business and Weill Hall.
Coleman delivered a significant num-
ber of the pitches to donors, saying in an
interview last week that she "genuinely
enjoys" fundraising because it ensures
that the University remains successful.
"I love doing it because I'm proud of
what we do at the University and I know
that this kind of funding is critical for the
future," Coleman said. "It's a big part of

other institutions.
As Coleman took office, she managed
to successfully navigate several initial
controversies. The University successful-
ly defended its affirmative action policies
before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003,
but then in 2006 Michigan voters passed
a constitutional amendment banning the
practice.
The Athletic Department was also fac-

booster scandal that embroiled the men's
