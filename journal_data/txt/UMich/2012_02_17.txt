GRADUATE STUDENTS
GEO faces
opposition
from state
Senate bill
Majority Leader
hopes to end GSRA
unionization effort
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily NewsEditor
In the battle over whether the
University's graduate student
research assistants should be
granted a vote to unionize, a new
player has entered the fray.
Michigan Senate Major-
ity Leader Randy Richardville
(R-Monroe) introduced a bill
Wednesday to amend the Michi-
gan Public Employment Rela-
tions Act to include a provision
barring GSRAs from achieving
the status of public employees -
denying them the right to collec-
tive bargainingrights.
The introduction of the bill
comes amid significant conflict
over the issue of unionization,
as members of the University
community have been debating
whether or not to define GSRAs
as public employees, subsequent-
ly granting them the ability to
vote if they want to organize. The
Graduate Employees' Organiza-
tion has primarily been fighting
the precedent of a 1981 Michigan
Employment Relations Commis-
sion ruling that state GSRAs are
not public employees.
In May, University Board of
Regents voted 6-2 in a party-
line, to classify GSRAs as public

Regents to launch
external review to
investigate fallout
from Jenson case
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
Washtenaw County prosecu-
tors dropped charges accusing
former UMHS resident Stephen
Jenson of possessing child por-
nography yesterday as the
University's Board of Regents
independently called for an
extended investigation into the
University's handling of the inci-
dent at its monthly meeting.
At Jenson's preliminary exam-
ination yesterday morning, 15th
District Court Judge Christo-
pher Easthope dismissed the case
without prejudice after he was
advised to do so by county pros-
ecutors and Jenson's attorney,
Joseph Simon, due to the federal
charges brought against Jenson.
He didn't appear in court because
he is currently in federal custody.'
Jenson was charged on Tues-
day with the possession and
receipt of child pornography
in an affidavit filed by the U.S.

Secret Service. According to the
affidavit, agents found 97 photos
and four videos of suspected child
pornography in a search warrant
executed by detectives from the
University's Department of Pub-
lic Safety on Dec. 2.
UMHS officials waited six
months to appropriately alert
DPS after a resident found a USB
thumb drive owned by Jenson
that contained child pornogra-
phy in May. University President
Mary Sue Coleman ordered an
internal audit of the delay on
Dec. 3. At the University Board
of Regent's meeting yesterday
afternoon, Coleman spoke briefly
regardingthe results of the inves-
tigation.
"It is a frank, difficult and nec-
essary assessment of the incident
itself as well as the larger con-
text of safety and security in our
health system and on our cam-
pus," Coleman said.
Regent S. Martin Taylor
(D-Grosse Pointe Farms) intro-
duced a motion, which declared
that the regents will immediately
"assume control and responsi-
bility for the directed remedial
actions that must be taken" in
response to the Jenson case.

Group organizes
at regents meeting
advocating for
new policy
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily News Editor
When LSA freshman Dan-
iel Morales was first admitted
to the University, he deferred
the start of his freshman year

because his family couldn't
afford the out-of-state tuition
rate without financial aid.
At the time, Morales was an
undocumented resident.
Due to his lack of citizen-
ship, Morale, who attended
high school in Michigan, was
not offered in-state tuition
or financial aid. Yesterday,
Morales told the University's
Board of Regents his story at its
monthly meeting, advocating
for a policy change that would
allow undocumented Michigan

residents to pay in-state tuition.
Currently, undocumented
students must pay out-of-state
tuition and are not eligible for
financial aid.
This year, the cost difference
between the in-state and out-
of-state rate for a full-time LSA
freshman is about $25,000.
"For the first time in my
life, I came close to giving up,"
Morales said. "But students like

Gov. Snyder
lauds Romney

Santorum tax
policy unveiled

Romney lands
endorsment,
slams Obama
By BETHANY BIRON
ManagingNews Editor
FARMINGTON HILLS -
In front of a packed house of
professionals hailing from
private sector industries
around the state, former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt
Romney professed his ado-
ration for his native state of
Michigan, lauding the work
of Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der in using his vast business
experience to revitalize the
ailing economy.
Romney's adulations come
on the heels of a formal
endorsement of the Repub-
lican presidential candidate
hopeful by Snyder, during
an event sponsored by the
Chamber of Commerce at the
Farmington Hills Manor in
Farmington Hills yesterday
afternoon. A crowd of almost
500 listened as Romney
discussed the importance

of understanding business
operations when working as
a government official seek-
ing to absolve persisting
problems of national debt.
With recent polls indicat-
ing a near tie between Rom-
ney and former Pennsylvania
Sen. Rick Santorum - who
also held a campaign event
yesterday in Detroit - lead-
ing into the Michigan presi-
dential primary on Feb. 28,
Snyder said it's crucial to
support a candidate with
business knowledge.
"We've got Governor
Romney, who has that acu-
men," Snyder said. "He has a
great combination of private
sector experience, but also
knowing what it takes to cre-
ate a job and how difficult
that is, how to succeed in the
private sector."
Romney echoed Snyder
and said utilizing the busi-
ness principles in develop-
ing government policy is
critical to assist a country
facing prolonged economic
peril. He praised Snyder for

schools every year with the
hopes of bettering our communi-
ties and lives, do not simply give
up. I was an American at heart
and more definitely, I was a wol-
verine."
Morales addressed the board
during the public comments sec-
tion of the meeting and spoke
about his struggle to attend the
University.
"I come here today to proudly
tell you my story because it rep-
resents the absolute complexity
of this issue," Morales said at the
meeting. "I am here today because
we would like to work with you
to remedy this injustice, alleviate
inequal access to higher education
for undocumented students and to
invest in a rich and truly diverse
experience for all Michigan stu-
dents."
Morales spoke on behalf of the
Coalition for Tuition Equality, a
student organization founded by
Public Policy junior Kevin Mersol-
Barg when he started his term last
fall as an LSA representative in
Central Student Government.
Mersol-Barg, who is running
for CSG president, said he hopes
the regents will collaborate with
the coalition.
"I'm hoping that they recip-
rocate our offer' to work with
them, that they would too want to
work with us," Mersol-Barg said.
"When Daniel spoke they looked
very receptive."
Morales echoed Mersol-Barg's
sentiments, and said in an inter-

view after the meeting he hopes
the University will work with the
organization to increase college
accessibility and affordability for
all students.
"My biggest hope is that they
will work with our coalition to
craft a new policy which is more
inclusive to all students from the
state of Michigan, and that we can
regain our status as a progressive
and fair school that gives any stu-
dent who is deserving of that edu-
cation a great education."
Mersol-Barg said he formed
the coalition, which is comprised
of representatives from various
student groups, because he saw an
injustice and wanted to fix it. He
said the number of undocumented
students at the University is not
possible to determine but is likely
very small, which could be due to
their difficulties affording tuition.
"This is a pressing issue for stu-
dents not only here at the Univer-
sity but even more students that
are very talented and bright and
can't be here," Mersol-Barg said.
After the speech, Morales said
though he was nervous before
he spoke, the nerves faded as he
began talking and he received
positive feedback from the regents
and people in attendance at the
meeting.
"Once I was up there, and once
I began to speak, I was kind of
amazed at the positive receptive-
ness of the entire board of regents
as a whole," Morales said. "I felt
they were very receptive to the
overall message once I was fin-
ished delivering the speech."
In his speech, Morales said dur-
ing the year he deferred his enroll-

ment, he sought and received
residency, which qualified him to
pay the in-state rate.
"As soon as I mentioned how
my acceptanceto the University of
Michigan-Ann Arbor was riding
on this, the ICE agent's eyes shot
up from his desk, and he smiled;
he was a Michigan Wolverine,"
Morales said.
At the end of Morales's speech
when he mentioned the different
student organizations that con-
tribute to the coalition, members
stood up around the room holding
signs naming their representative
groups - including Central Stu-
dent Government, American Civil
Liberties Union-Undergraduate
Chapter, Latino Students Orga-
nization and Muslim Students'
Association - then walked out
of the Regents' Room on the first
floor of the Fleming Administra-
tion Building.
Though the timer went off that
indicated Morales's five-minutes
of allotted speaking time was up,
the room remained silent, and he
quickly finished the last few sen-
tences of his speech.
Upon commencing his speech,
regents Laurence Deitch (D-
Bingham Farms) and Andrea
Fischer Newman (R-Ann Arbor)
commended him and the mem-
bers of the coalition for attending
the meeting.
Morales said he was encour-
aged to speak at the regents meet-
ing by E. Royster Harper, vice
president for student affairs, at a
town hall meeting on Feb. 8.
"I went directly to the source
because I thought that was the
way that change can come about,"

like as a zero percent corpo-
rate tax rate - that would ben-
efit manufacturing companies.
"Manufacturing, making
things, is the key to wealth cre-
ation in any society," Santorum
said.
Santorum also suggested
large-scale changes to energy
policies. Specifically, he empha-
sized the importance of cheap
energy, citing that countries
with high standards of living
have lower energy prices and
noting that the 2008 economic
recession was exacerbated by
high energy costs.
Santorum said President
Barack Obama views American
oil, gas and coal resources as a
"liability," but Santorum said he
believes it is necessary to extract
more natural energy resources.
"I want to open up the Alaska
Wildlife Refuge to create more

opportunities for us to extract
oil," Santorum said.
Santorum criticized Obama
in a variety of areas, specifically
stating that he was "suffocating"
the economy, adding that Obama
was more concerned with forc-
ing automakers to produce clean-
er cars than with encouraging oil
drilling and pipeline creation.
Santorum added that Obama's
views are not compatible with
a country "that believes in free
people and free markets."
In a question-and-answer ses-
sion after the speech, Santorum
said Obama instigated a "war
on private education," citing
community colleges and private
schools as the only way to meet
the "exploding demand" for
skilled and semi-skilled labor.
He also discussed the need to
fund private schoolsto help meet
the needs of businesses.
Students from Eastern Michi-
gan University, Baker Univer-
sity and several high schools in
Michigan attended Santorum's

speech.
Noah Crowder, a senior at
Chelsea High School in Chelsea,
Mich., came with his govern-
ment class and said he enjoyed
the speech.
"I think he hit a lot of issues
that were really true to Detroit
and the Michigan area," Crowder
said.
Gary Lesnau, a teacher at
Divine Child High School in
Dearborn, Mich., accompanied
his students to the speech and
said it was an educational trip.
"It's good exposure to the peo-
ple who are the movers and the
shakers in this country," Lesnau
said.
Amy Pestenariu, a senior at
Divine Child, said she thought
Santorum would be a good
candidate for students and the
younger generation to support.
"Younger people should be
concerned about the job market,
and, in that respect, he would be
a good candidate for them," Pes-
tenauriu said.

the hiring of experts to exam-

Taylor said. "And we the regents

employees. University
President Mary Sue Coleman
expressed concern at the May
meeting about allowing GSRAs
to unionize, but has been silent
on the issue since the regents
voted the other way. University
Provost Phil Hanlon, who tes-
tified at the hearing before the
administrative law judge that
ended last Monday, agreed with
Coleman at the time. In October,
a number of University deans
also expressed opposition to
granting GSRAs collective bar-
gaining rights.
Michigan Attorney General
Bill Schuette has been an out-
spoken advocate against GSRA
" unionization. His actions have
included filing briefs with MERC,
the Michigan Supreme Court and
Michigan Circuit Courts to inter-
vene in the matter.
In a statement to The Michi-
gan Daily in response to the bill,
the attorney general defended his
involvement in the question of
GSRA unionization.
"The taxpayers of Michigan
definitelyhave acompellinginter-
est in an issue that will disrupt the
(University), which is one of our
state's crown jewels, academically
and economically," Schuette said
in the statement. "We remain sup-
portive of the (University) leader-
ship, the folks best equipped to
know, which feels that this issue
will disrupt the effectiveness of
the university."
Richardville could not be
reached for comment yesterday.
Though until now much of the
fight between those in favor and
those opposed to unionization
has taken place within MERC's
framework, Stephen Raiman,
founder of Students Against
GSRA Unionization and a Rack-
ham student, said he is happy that
the state Senate has taken up the
issue.
"It's only now because GEO
is attempting to change the law
that a bill like this is necessary,"

work in cutting costs in Mich-
igan in the past fiscal year, in
which he brought a debt-ridden
state into a $457 million surplus,
as revealed during Snyder's fis-
cal year 2013 budget proposal
last week.
"If we can do in Washington
what you guys have done here;
V we'd be in a great position as a
nation," Romney said. "I hope to
do in Washington as the gover-
nor has done here."
Romney added that govern-
ment officials at all levels must
carefully monitor budgets so as
not to spend money outside of
their thresholds and create fur-
ther debt.
"You see, in the private sector
that you all are in, you're either
fiscally conservative, or you're
out of business. You can't bor-
row money year after year after
year spending more than you
take in, or you go bankrupt."
Romney's father was gover-
norofMichiganinthe 1960s, and
was chairman and president of

American Motors Corporation.
During his speech yesterday,
Romney expressed compassion
for the state's rejuvenated auto-
mobile industry, following an
op-ed he wrote for The Detroit
News this week that was criti-
cal of the federal government's
bailout of the automotive indus-
try, and an announcement by
General Motors yesterday that
the company earned a $472 mil-
lion profit in the fourth quarter
of 2011.
"I love cars. I grew up totally
loving cars," Romney said "It
used to be in the '50s and '60s
you showed me one square foot
of a car, I could tell you what
brand it was, model and so forth
... I love American cars, and long
live they rule the world."
Romney said job creation will
be a major priority of his if he is
elected president, adding that
he will work with businesses to

Raiman said. "So I think it's very
clear that this legislation is in
response to GEO's attempt to
change the law right now."
Liz Rodrigues, communi-
cations chair for GEO a and
Rackham student, expressed dis-
comfort with taking the issue of
unionization to the state Legisla-
ture.
"I also think that this shows
a lack of faith in the democratic
process (since) there's currently
a process underway to determine
this question, and ultimately
GSRAs should have the right to
vote and decide this matter for
themselves," Rodrigues said. "It's
confusing to me why (Richard-
ville) would be tryingto take away
their right to vote."
Rodrigues also said she disap-
proved of some of the language in
the bill.
The provision that deals with
GSRA unionization states that
GSRAs, or those in similar posi-
tions, cannot sufficiently demon-
strate they are in an "employment
relationship" and are not public
employees, making them ineligi-
ble for collective bargaining."
Rodrigues said since there is
currently a process underway -
the deliberations before MERC
and the administrative law judge
- to determine the "indicia of an
employment relationship," or the
employment status of GSRAs and
the provision in the bill is unnec-
essary.
Both Raiman and Rodrigues
agree that the timing of this bill
must be strategic, given the atten-
tion that the GSRA issue has been
receiving recently.
"The timing is puzzling and
concerning," Rodrigues said. "It
seems to be interrupting an ongo-
ing process and it also certainly
couldn't come at a worse time ...
it seems to be increasing tension
and moving the focus away from
democratic process."
"I think it's not a coincidence
that it is coming at this time,"
Raiman said.
The bill is being introduced
in the wake of a hearing before
an administrative law judge

intended to determine whether
GSRAs should be classified as
public employees. The official
hearing - in which only repre-
sentatives from the University
and GEO were allowed to testify
- ended last Monday. However,
on Wednesday Julia Stern, the
administrative law judge, decid-
ed to grant outside parties, such
as Schuette and SAGU, the right
to call on witnesses in a special
addition to the hearing set to
begin on Tuesday.
The introduction of the bill
by a Republican senator has also
served to reinforce the politiciza-
tion of the fightoverunionization
and the division of positions on
unionization along party lines.
"Unfortunately, unionization
does tend to be a political issue,"
Raiman said. "And in fact, the
only reason ... this is becoming a
discussion in the first place is due
to politicsbecause of the political
makeup of the Board of Regents,
the political makeup of MERC, so
it's kind of acting on both sides,
although my organization is truly
a bipartisan organization ... we're
not politically motivated."
While it remains unclear
whether the bill will move for-
ward in the Senate or be intro-
duced in the House, both GEO
and SAGU said they will be moni-
toring its development.
"I'm hopeful," Raiman said.
"I see it's been introduced by the
senate majority leader, so I'm
hopeful that the bill will make
it through the Senate and the
House."
Rodrigues said GEO does not
expect to change their approach
to getting a vote on unionization
because of the bill, but hopes it
does not pass.
"If it did (pass) I think it would
certainly be a troubling develop-
ment for the state of Michigan
seeing as we're trying to attract
more and better researchers to
this state," Rodrigues said. "So
(for) attracting graduate stu-
dents, it doesn't send a good
message if they don't respect
graduate students' work at that
level."

Regents abolish bylaw
on presidency age limit

Basketball complex
named for William
Davidson
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily News Editor
University President Mary Sue
Coleman may now carry out the
remainder of her current con-
tract without violating the Uni-
versity's Regents' Bylaws.
The University's Board of
Regents convened for its month-
ly meeting yesterday, where it
changed a bylaw requiring that
the University president retire by
70. The regents also approved the
naming of a handful of campus
buildings and several renovation
projects.
Regent S. Martin Taylor (D-
Grosse Pointe Farms) said the
change is necessary and was not
done to specifically protect Cole-
man, but to be sure the University
is not committing age discrimi-
nation.
The change will take effect
in the 2013 fiscal year and will
allow University President Mary
Sue Coleman to remain president
until 2014 when her contract
expires. Coleman, who is cur-
rently 68, will turn 70 before the
July 2014 expiration date.
"It is not about any individual
whatsoever," Taylor said. "Our
motivation, complete and total, is
that the lawyers advised us that
the bylaws - this specific guide-
line - is in violation of the law,
civil rights and the Civil Rights
Act, so we're changing it."
DAVIDSON FOUNDATION
MAKES $7.5 MILLION GIFT

After receiving a $7.5 million
gift from the William Davidson
Foundation, the regentsapproved
the naming of the newly-built
Player Development Center for
Intercollegiate Basketball as the
William Davidson Player Devel-
opment Center.
Coleman said she is appre-
ciative of the family's gift and
wishes Davidson, who owned the
Detroit Pistons and died in 2009,
could see how well the basketball
team is doingnow.
"He was a very generous
supporter of the University of
Michigan, and I am so pleased,"
Coleman said.
Construction of the center
was approved by the regents
in September 2009. The space,
which cost the University $23.2
million, is 57,000 square feet and
features locker rooms for coach-
es and players, two indoor prac-
tice courts, medical facilities
and an equipment room. There
are also offices, film rooms and
space set aside for conditioning.
Davidson participated in
track and field during his time as
a student at the University.
Regent Denise Ilitch (D-Bing-
ham Farms) said the she is glad
Davidson is being commemorat-
ing the "incredibly generous"
nature of himself and his family.
COMPUTER SCIENCE
AND ENGINEERING
BUILDING NAMED
The board also gave the go-
ahead to rename the Computer
Science and Engineering Build-
ing on North Campus the Bob
and Betty Beyster Building.
Beyster, who received his
bachelor's, master's and doctor-

al degrees from the University,
recently donated $15 million to
the College of Engineering. The
donation will be used to start the
J. Robert Beyster Computational
Innovation Graduate Fellows
Program, among other things.
Timothy Slottow, the Univer-
sity's executive vice president
and chief financial officer,
called the gift from Beyster
generous.
"It's a wonderful family from
southern California who've
been very involved, and it's a
historic gift," Slottow said.
Beyster founded . Science
Applications International
Corporation, which became
the largest employee-owned
research and technology com-
pany in the country during his
35 years as chairman of the
company's board of directors.
CONSTRUCTION
CONTRACTS AWARDED
The regents also awarded
bids and contracts for the reno-
vation of East Quad Residence
Hall, the Lawyer's Club and the
John P. Cook Dormitory.
The board approved the
schematic design for the
East Quad renovations at last
November's meeting. The con-
struction, scheduled to be com-
plete in the summer of 2013, is
estimated to cost $116 million.
At last December's meet-
ing, the board approved plans
for the renovations to the two
buildings in the Law Quadran-
gle, which are estimated to cost
$39 million and are partially
funded by a gift from Univer-
sity alum Charles Munger, vice
chair of Berkshire Hathaway.


generate increased revenue to
spur job creation.
"The whole idea of profit is
to create incentives to entre-
preneurs and innovators to find
ways to do things less and less
expensive with better and bet-
ter quality," Romney said.
Mark Cords, a University
alum who has worked for Gener-
al Motors for 30 years, said in an
interview after the event he has
"mixed feelings" about Obama's
handling of the auto bailout, but
ultimately understands the need
for government intervention
to assist one of America's most
coveted industries.
"When I go back to (the Uni-
versity), the professors that I
still know tell me, you know,
it's not for government to save
industries," Cords said. "How-
ever, having said that, the auto
industry is such an integral part
of not only this state, but this
country, and I can certainly
understand the need for them to
provide some support."
The federal government pro-
vided GM with $49.5 billion and
Chrysler with $10.8 billion in
2008 and 2009.
Cords called Romney a "prov-
en winner in the private sector,"
addingthat despite the criticism
that he may lack the charisma
and compassion to become pres-
ident, voters should not be quick
to judge.
"The pundits all talk about
how he doesn't really have that
energy or that passion," he said.
"I think everyone has a differ-
ent style. I've had the pleasure
of meeting the governor, when
he was campaigning, I wasn't
really all that impressed with
his onstage presence, but now
that I've looked beyond that,
I've seen that there's more sub-
stance to the man than just a
sound bite or a quick line."
Rusty Hills, director of pub-
lic affairs for Michigan Attor-
ney General Bill Schuette, said
obtaining an endorsement from
Snyder will be important in
garnering support for Romney
looking forward, adding that

Santorum's upswing of success
can be attributed to momentum
which Romney will likely regain
leading into the Michigan pri-
mary.
"The primaries are all about
momentum, and it's about who's
won last, and there's no doubt
that Senator Santorum is rid-
ing a wave of momentum from
his three wins last Tuesday, and
that's what's propelled him in
the polls in Michigan."
Thus far, Santorum has won
primary contests in Iowa, Colo-
rado, Missouri and Minnesota.
Hills, who is also a lecturer at
the Ford School of Public Policy,
said as a growing number of
students struggle to find jobs
after graduation, the election
will give Romney a time to show
them he's capable of increasing
job security.
"We've got to do a better
job of creating jobs and keep-
ing jobs. in our state," Hill said.
"I think the Obama adminis-
tration's failed on that front.
I think there's a real opportu-
nity for Mitt Romney and the
Republicans to attract a much
larger percentage of the youth
vote than four years ago, pre-
cisely because I think we've got
a prescription to provide jobs to
young graduates and do a much
better job at it than the adminis-
tration is doing right now."
Amanda Caldwell, chair of
the University's chapter of Col-
lege Democrats, said the waver-
ing support between Republican
candidates demonstrates weak-
ness and splintering within the
Republican Party.
"We've had a huge swing to
the right," Caldwell said. "Two
years ago in 2010, we had a
Republican governor coming
in, and huge majorities in the
(state) House and Senate for
Republicans, and I think people
are just really unhappy with
what they've seen come out of
the state since that shift. I think
we're going to have a lot of folks
swinging back the other way,
back in support of Obama and
other Democrats."

Same sex, same rights
Mich. should follow trend of marraige equality
The state of Washington's recent legalization of same-sex mar-
riage is an important step toward equal rights in this country.
This is a positive breakthrough for the United States, not only
because of the moral obligation to provide equal rights to all, but also
for practical economic reasons. Same-sex couples should be allowed

Don't skate around the issue

This weekend, the University
will sponsor free ice skat-
ing on North Campus in an
attempt to dis-
pel the notion
that the campus
is a lost abyss.,
There are worse
ways to use our ,
money. But as a
North Campus
denizen and an JOEL
Architecture and BATTERMAN
Urban Planning
student, I have to
conclude that without more serious
change in the University's approach
to the campus, efforts to re-brand it
are bound to fall flat.
Frankly, we'd be better off if North
Campus didn't exist. The University
could have chosen to grow up instead
of out, keeping its original Central
Campus footprint with some added
expansion into the near-downtown
neighborhoods. Ann Arbor's sky-
line would look a bit different, and
we wouldn't see as many deer, but
we'd have saved ourselves innu-
merable hours crammed into buses
and countless calories consumed at
Panda Express.
Unfortunately, in 1952 Univer-
sity planners still believed that cars
would make the very concept of
distance disappear, and felt wide
open spaces were more necessary to
human life than daily conveniences
you could reach on foot. Back then,
not much existed in Ann Arbor
north of the Huron River, but that
didn't stop the University from buy-
ing itself a giant new campus in the
middle of nowhere. The US-23 free-
way was originally planned to run
up Huron Parkway, so they might
have been counting on being right
near the off-ramp.
Whatever the weird logic of that
decision, there's no going back now.
Yet that doesn't mean we have to
resign ourselves to the North Cam-
pus that currently exists. Indeed, the

University is realizing that the cur-
rent state of the campus is a liability.
It seems candidates for faculty
positions have complained North
Campus doesn't even feel like a part
of Ann Arbor, setting off alarm bells
among the deans anxious to recruit
top talent in engineering and other
disciplines that are housed in North
Campus.
As a result, more substantive
action - beyond ice rinks and hot
air balloons - is underway. In 2008,
the University completed a North
Campus Master Plan Update that
envisioned a more densely developed
campus, with a walkable city block
replacing the current car-oriented
Northwood culs-de-sac. The Univer-
sity has also helped fund a study on
improving the heinously overcrowd-
ed transit line between the campus-
es, though only after much coaxing
from the city.
The University has also helped
fund a study on improving the hei-
nously overcrowded transit line
between the campuses, though only
after much coaxing; one City offi-
cial I spoke with last year expressed
exasperation that the University had
to be persuaded to put up a paltry
$50,000 for the project.
But none of this goes far enough.
To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, the
University is not the solution to
North Campus; the University is
the problem. The biggest issue with
North Campus isn't the absence of
skating opportunities, but the pathet-
ic lack of choices for basic goods like
food, a direct result of the Univer-
sity's monopolization of the 800-acre
North Campus area.
My politics run left, but the
dearth of decent conveniences on
North Campus relative to Cen-
tral is an excellent argument for
the superiority of open markets in
certain contexts. A single block of
South University adjacent to Cen-
tral Campus has more restaurants
than the whole of North Campus.

Perhaps half the late-night traffic on
Broadway is pizza delivery vehicles
smuggling contraband edibles onto
campus, while long lunchtime lines
for often sub-par food on North itself
resemble those of 1980s Moscow. In
fact, the Pierpont Commons base-
ment is crony capitalism atits greas-
iest, since the University essentially ,
auctions off fast food rights to the
highest bidders.
Supply-side
economics for
North Campus. *
To fill the North Campus abyss,
the University could start by permit-
ting food carts there. It should also
consider selling real estate at key
locations, such as the parkinglots off
Fuller Road, so that developers can
meet demand for more stores and
services there and the properties can
contribute to Ann Arbor's tax base.
As University Planner Susan Gott
said, Ann Arbor might not need a
second downtown like that of State
Street, but the growth of the small
shopping district at Plymouth Road
and Murfin Avenue, which already
contains a few excellent restaurants
despite its distance from the cam-
pus's core, indicates just how much
of an afterthought North Campus's
people are under current University
policy. Changing that would make
students a lot happier, which is in
the direct interest of the Univer-
sity. And heck, if new development
brings a few bars within walking
distance of the Taubman College of
Architecture and Urban Planning,
I'm sure not complaining.

to marry in all 50 states.
On Monday, Washington Gov. Christine
Gregoire signed a gay marriage bill, making
Washington the sixth state to legalize same-
sex marriage. Gay marriage is already legal
in Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New York and Vermont. Same-sex
marriage is also legal in Washington, D.C. New
Jersey's gay marriage bill, approved by the
State Senate yesterday, was sent to Republican
Gov. Chris Christie for his signature, though he
is expected to veto it.
The steps these states have taken toward
equal marriage rights are commendable and
a positive trend for our country. Michigan
should not sit on the sidelines of progress.
In addition to the states that have legalized
same-sex marriage, there are 16 others that
currently offer either civil unions or domes-
tic partnerships. But Michigan is not follow-
ing suit. On the contrary, on Dec. 22, Gov.
Rick Snyder signed a ban forbidding state
employees from receiving domestic partner
benefits. It is inexcusable that while the rest
of the country becomes increasingly tolerant,
Michigan's legislature is inhibiting the rights
of a minority.
For those not convinced by the moral argu-
ment for marriage equality, legalization of gay
marriage helps the personal finances of the
couples involved and benefits the economy
at large. Married couples are privileged with
joint finances and shared insurance, whereas
unmarried couples end up paying extrafor
these services because they are kept separate.

Allowing same-sex couples to marry would
make them more financially secure - some-
thing that should be a priority in hard eco-
nomic times. Some companies will resent
having to cover additional spouses under their
insurance plans, but the financial costs do not
outweigh the moral implications of marriage
equality. This should be no excuse to hinder
marriage legalization.
California's Proposition 8, which was a 2008
ballot measure banning same-sex marriage,
was declared unconstitutional by a federal
appeals court last week. The case will likely
be brought to the Supreme Court where the
justices will have a pivotal opportunity to pro-
mote equal rights. The legality of the Defense
of Marriage Act of 1996 also has frequently
been called into question. America's judiciary
system should continue to take action against
discriminatory laws such as this and stand up
for equality.
The time has come for America to fully
accept gays as equal citizens. This is a question
not of personal opinions or religious beliefs, but
rather of the progression of society. Jim Crow
laws are still in recent memory, and we shud-
der at the ignorance and bigotry of those rac-
ist policies. The present question of same-sex
marriage puts us at a similar crossroads. Mich-
igan needs to reverse its shift toward repress-
ing same-sex couples. Michigan, along with the
other 43 states that have yet to legalize same-
sex marriage, should choose to be on the right
side of history by taking action now.

Dibbern should waive
FERPA and release records
TO THE DAILY:
It's time to hear the full story surrounding
the Jennifer Dibbern case.
Dibbern,withthehelpofGraduateEmploy-
ees Organization, has publicly claimed her
GSRA appointment ended because of her
involvement in union-forming efforts. The
University claims it ended because of poor
academic performance. Due to FERPA - the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
- the University has been prevented from
releasing the full story to the public. We
have heard from Jennifer's colleagues who
claim she wasn't an effective researcher, but
they don't have access to academic records,
department files and records of conversa-
tions between Dibbern and her advisors.
These records can only become available if
Dibbern waives her FERPA rights.
I understand Dibbern wants to retain her'
privacy, but this situation is being used as
support for unionization, which will affect

2,200 current GRSAs and may affect GSRAs
for years to come. Having chosen to make
this matter public, all the facts are necessary.
The key question is whether the Univer-
sity's decision is academically justified or
not. If this situation is as clear-cut as has
been claimed, then certainly the release of
all department files will back that up. While
we understand and respect FERPA, these
records need to be released so this issue can
be properly examined.
Dibbern cannot have it both ways. She
cannot expect us to believe that she was
unfairly dismissed while refusing to give all
parties access to evidence that could support
or refute her claims. If Dibbern and GEO
are not playing a political game and really
believe what they say, it is time to show their
cards. If GEO intends to continue to making
claims of intimidation, then Dibbern needs to
waive her FERPA rights, and let us all see the
whole story - not just the part of the story
that Dibbern and her GEO colleagues choose
to release.
Steven Raiman
Founder ofStudents Against GSRA
Unionization

Boeing 747s, security lines
and seat belt signs are all
things I associate with
stress. Consid-
ering air travel
in my family has
long consisted
of frantic checks
to make sure
bags are prop-
erly packed and
three-ounce LEAH
containers are
tightly sealed, POTKIN
the stress has
certainly been
justified.
Well, apparently I'm not alone
in my anxiety. Enough travel-
ers share my concerns that a
recent article in Time magazine
announced the addition of a yoga
room to the San Francisco Inter-
national Airport to promote relax-
ation during travel.
Quite frankly, this is a lovely
idea - props to San Francisco. But
if airport travel causes enough
stress to justify a room dedicated to
relaxation, then college campuses
certainly do too. In fact, with the
winning mix of midterms, papers
and job applications, I can't think
of a place better fit for - or more in
need of - such a calming space.
Many students would agree that
life on campus, though rewarding
in its challenges, is at least as cha-
otic as an airport, and certainly
deserves a space dedicated to relax-
ation. Thus, the University should
follow in the footsteps of the inno-
vative California airport, which
converted a 150 square-foot stor-
age room into an open space with
chairs and yoga mats, and create
public spaces for students to take
study breaks and escape from the
stresses of life on campus.
To promote relaxation, the yoga
room in San Francisco requests
that visitors remove their shoes and
refrain from bringing food, drinks or

cell phones into the silent area. These
requirements, referred to by the air-
port as "Yoga Room Etiquette," cre-
ate an environment of tranquility in
an otherwise chaotic arena.
In the same way a traveler could
use the yoga room to de-stress after
dealing with a particularly irritat-
ing Travel Security Administration
official, students could use relax-
ation centers to relax during exams,
after a long study session or even
between classes.
Sound mental health is vital for
students' success here on campus.
Having a convenient place to de-
stress during the day, perhaps in the
UGLi or Duderstadt, would benefit
students immensely.
Not only would students have
the leisure of popping in for a quick
mental break between classes, but
they'd also have the benefit of a
place where dissociation from their
fast-paced lives is both possible and
encouraged. And while the Univer-
sity does already offer classes in
meditation and yoga, students have
to work these into their schedules
- not on an as-needed basis. Keep-
ing in mind that most students
already lead very busy lives, the
convenience of drop-in relaxation
centers on campus would likely
encourage students to take advan-
tage of this resource more readily
than if they had to schedule time
into their days.
Ann Arbor certainly has its fair
share of yoga studios. I'd assume
from the number of people I see
double-fisting backpacks and yoga
mats that they're popular, but these
classes come at a price. All students
should have access to places where
they can center themselves free of
charge, and the creation of relax-
ation centers would quite easily
allow for this.
As the Time article mentioned,
the yoga room in the airport doesn't
include instructors or any additional
amenities, and merely serves as an

environment in which people are
free of noise, commotion and other
external stressors. And while the
term "yoga room" might conjure up
images of people in the downward
dog position, a campus relaxation
center would not be limited to yoga
practices and could be used merely
as a place to sit in silent meditation.
Thus, creation of such spaces would
require little effort on the Universi-
ty's part, yet would benefit students
in big ways.
Not to mention, the benefits of
relaxation practices, while already
widely appreciated, are only recent-
ly becoming better known, and dare
I even say, trendy. With celebrities
like Oprah, Ellen DeGeneres and
Russell Brand promoting Transcen-
dental Meditation, the popularity of
such practices is no longer limited to
the hippie, alternative type and will
undoubtedly continue to grow.
Students need
quiet recharging
spaces.
So, while airports are certainly
stressful, college campuses with-
out a doubt rival them as places in
need of some good old R&R. While
some students may find it easy to
relax either at home or in front of
the television, many students would
take comfort in having a convenient
place here on campus to escape their
everyday stress. The San Francisco
International Airport is onto some-
thing, and the University should fol-
low in its footsteps.

JOE BIDEN
For abuse, 'l is 2 many

More than twenty years ago, I read a study of
junior high school students in Rhode Island that
included one finding I've never been able to get
out of my head. Students were asked if a man who
spent money on a woman during a date was entitled
to force her into sexual activity. An astounding 25
percent of the young boys said yes - and even more
astounding, 17 percent of the junior high school
" girls agreed.
You may think that sounds like a long time ago
- and it was. But, sadly, dating violence remains a
very real problem in our country - especially on
college campuses.
Today, while in college, nearly one in five
women will be a victim of sexual assault and one in
ten teens will be hurt on purpose by someone they
are dating. These aren't just statistics, these are
people you know: your roommates, your friends,
your sisters, your classmates. This is a problem we
all have to face.
My dad used to say that there's no worse sin than
the abuse of power. Whether it was raising a hand
to someone weaker, or using any advantage to push
people around, he taught me that if you saw abuse,
you had an obligation to attempt to stop it. It's a
lesson to remember every day, but especially this
February, during Teen Dating Violence Awareness
and Prevention Month.
Awareness is the first step to pushing back against
a problem this big. When I held Senate hearings on
violence against women more than two decades ago,
domestic abuse in American society was rarely spo-
ken about in public. I'll never forget the stories of
abuse I heard in over a thousand hours of hearings.
The brutality of family members, acquaintances,
and strangers against the women in their lives was
absolutely devastating.
It was those hearings that led to the Violence
Against Women Act, and since then annual inci-
dents of domestic violence have dropped by more
than 50%. But for women in college and younger
today, the risk is still much too high.
That's why I joined with Education Secretary
Arne Duncan last April to announce historic new
guidelines for colleges and universities about their
responsibilities under Title IX to prevent sexual
assault. Under the federal civil rights law, schools

have an obligation not only to respond appropriately
when an assault occurs, but also to create a climate
on campus that makes such violence unacceptable.
I also started an initiative called lis2many to
help reduce dating violence and sexual assault
among teens and young adults. We harnessed
the power of technology to get our message out,
launching a national contest to develop "Apps
Against Abuse." The two winning apps - which
will be available later this spring - will let you get
in touch with your friends quickly and safely so
you can call for help if you need it and stop violence
in its tracks. We've also made sure the National
Dating Abuse Helpline can be reached by text,
online or phone 24/7.
Last month, the FBI changed the way the fed-
eral government defines rape. The narrow, out-
dated definition - unchanged since 1929 - said the
assault had to be forcible and against a woman's
will to be classified as rape. It's just not true, and
it's a point that I make on college campuses all
across the country. Rape is rape, and no means no.
No means no whether drunk or sober. No means no
whether in the dorm room or on the street. There
is never an excuse. Young women and men alike
need to understand this. Under the new definition,
rape occurs when there is no consent, and it also
includes sexual assault against boys and young
men in national law enforcement reporting.
These are important changes, but ending dat-
ing violence and sexual assault isn't just a matter
of laws and legislation. It's about education. It's
about attitudes. It's about your participation. I
need your help to address this issue in your dorms
and on your campuses. Studies show that men's
ideas about what other men think is one of the
strongest determinants of how they act. So guys,
you need to speak out.
The ultimate measure of a civilized society is
how its laws and culture treat the abuse of women.
Attitudes can change. Violence can end. But it
can't happen without universal understanding
that dating violence and sexual assault will never
be tolerated anywhere, at any time, for any reason.
Period. That's all of our responsibility.
Joe Biden is the Vice President of the United States.

The Honorable Rick

SEND LETTERS TO: TOTHEDAILY@MICHIGANDAILY.COM

DETRIOT -
B efore my candidate
for President of these
Americas, the former-
but-always-
honorable
Pennsylva-
nia Sen. Rick "
Santorum,
went from
his honor-
able seat
to the even
honorable-r ANDREW
podium at a WEINER
Detroit Eco-
nomic Club
luncheon yesterday, a prayer was
recited.
Well, two, I suppose.
The first and always-foremost
favorite prayer:the Pledge of Alle-
giance. I mean, I don't need to re-
pledge my allegiance to America,
as I was born here and born with
allegiance in my beating heart.
But still, it's nice to hear.
A priest recited the second. It
was a nice concept, but the con-
tent was all wrong. Frankly, it was
offensive to real red-white-and-
bluers such as Mr. Santorum and
myself. The priest had the right
idea when he blessed the blessed
candidate - but then he made a
grave, and possibly communist,
error. Along with Rick, he blessed
allwho seek office.
All?
Father, for someone who has
such a direct line to the big man
upstairs, you should know that
God specifically and explicitly
does not bless all candidates -
that would include a certain
Kenyan-secret-Muslim-non-
American-who-shall-not-be-
named. How do I know God's
will? Rick told me, and who would
know it better than the former
representative of Pennsylvania?
After all, what's Scranton if not a
modern day Garden of Eden?
Speaking of paradise, Rick said
he was hot and bothered to be in
Detroit, a city that was "known
for prosperity." Detroit: model
to the country - nay, the world!
And Detroit was honored he was
here, too.
No eyes could have been more
honored to look upon the future

President of the United States of
America than the student groups
that were there. A couple stu-
dents fainted from the sheer sight
of him - wait, that was me. Each
group's plate was paid for by a
sponsor, which sounds an awful
lot like a handout, if you ask me.
But since they were from a busi-
ness, I'll have to ask Rick if that's
honorable.
Rick talked a lot about taxes.
Luckily for real American job
creators like myself - I recently
hired two dogs to paint a por-
trait of another dog - he talked
about my favorite kind of taxes:
no taxes.
I don't always pay taxes, but
when I do, my rate is in single
digits. So while only two rates for
income taxes are nice - 10 per-
cent and 28 percent that Ricky
proposed in his speech - I would
have thought God would have
told his BFF Rick to keep them
a little honorably closer to my
favorite number: no taxes.
While we're on numbers, Rick
spoke to the Occupiers, or as my
painting dogs and I like to call
them, "the poor." Rick, honor-
able as ever, knows that Presi-
dent Oh-what's-his-name has
been engaging in class warfare
since the day he was born in the
hot Kenyan sun.
Rick knows this isn't about
99 percent, or Mitt the Mud-
slinger's 95 percent. We need a
candidate like Rickles, who said
at that podium he supports 100
percent of the 1 percent. I think.
Don't quote me on those num-
bers. Fractions aren't really my
thing. If they were, I'd be a lib-
eral elitist.
Speaking of liberal elit-
ists: Obama. As if I needed any
reminder other than the gap-
ing hole in my heart since he
took office, I learned some new
reasons Obama has ruined our
country beyond repair - unless
Rick wins.
Did you know that by raising
federal fuel economy standards,
the Socialist in Chief forced
automakers to produce more
unsafe cars? Rick said it, so it
must be true.
Or how about the rejection of

the Keystone XL pipeline? Rick
told us today that Obama has
social-communist idea to keep
natural resources in the ground.
Rick and I want them in the
economy where they belong. He
brought a rock along that sup-
posedly oil comes from. I usu-
ally don't believe in that science
mumbo-jumbo, but I'll take his
word for it.
Most importantly, Rick
warned me of Obama's biggest
war against society: the war on
families. I don't understand the
economic formula behind it, but
families are absolutely vital to
our economy. And not just any
kind, the honorable kind. If you
don't know what kind that .is,
you're probably in the wrong
kind.
Family, oil
rocks and
ending with a
Reagan quote.
We need families with amoth-
er and a father. Marriage is on
the decline, and that just doesn't
groove with Rick, myself or my
dogs and their paintbrushes. To
encourage the honorable types
to have honorable-type children,
Rick will triple child deductions
and end marriage tax penalties.
After all, Rick said an over-
whelming majority of prison
inmates grew up without a
father. We've got to save the
family before all our kids are
in prison! Maybe all children
should be required to have two
fathers. They could even share a
bed tobe economical!
Because here in America, the
Shining City on a Hill, isn't fam-
ily, oil rocks and ending with a
Reagan quotation what we're all
about? It is in Rick's America, and
isn't his the honorable kind?

Celebrating 40 years of Title IX
TO THE DAILY:
In honor of the 40th anniversary of Title IX,
the Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act,
my public radio station aired a story on the sub-
stantial improvement in girls' and women's sports
since Title IX was enacted in 1972. As I listened, I
distinctly recalled my own experience at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, where I started the women's
lacrosse team.
It was the mid-1980s, 13 years after the passage
of Title IX, and I was a freshman at the University.
An East Coast transplant living in the Midwest for
the first time, I had spent my spring seasons playing
high school girls' lacrosse. So it was with some dis-
may when I fielded questions repeatedly about the
wooden stick laced with leather straps that I carried
around campus with me looking for a playmate.
After finding a critical mass of women who knew
9 what my foreign object was and how to use it, my
effort to start a team began. At the time there was
a men's club lacrosse team, so precedent for such
an endeavor existed. The Athletic Department
approved our application and gave us a modest sum
of money and permission to use the turf late in the
evening on a weeknight to practice. Each player paid
dues, and we used the money to buy equipment and
uniforms and rent vans to travel to our games.

I remember the long walk to the field downby the
Intramural Sports Building on those chilly March
nights. Being mindful of our safety on those dark,
deserted streets, we would walk there and back as
one large posse, carrying dangerous instruments
we called lax sticks. On the field under the lights,
after the men had their practice, we would run drills,
condition and strategize for our upcoming games.
We were a motley crew of University women, from
freshmen to graduate students, all coming together
under tough conditions for the love of lacrosse and
the camaraderie of team sports. On the weekends we
rented vans and drove ourselves three hours south
to play other women's college teams. Because there
wasn'tone other lacrosse team in Michigan, when we
wanted to compete closer to home, we played against
the few suburban Detroit high schools that had girls'
lacrosse teams. Four years later, when I left Michi-
gan, the team was growing in size and strength.
Those were the 1980s. Much has improved since
that time - both at my beloved University and for
female athletes around the country. Women athletes
my age have stories much the same. As I look to my
daughter's generation of competitors, I am mindful
of the past and encouraged by the .course that has
been set for the future.

Politicians have a funny way of rewriting history

FARMINGTON HILLS - Politicians
have a funny way of rewriting history.
Few people exemplify this unfortu-
nate truth better than former Massa-
chusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Yesterday, I
had the pleasure of attending a Romney
campaign luncheon in Farmington Hills
where Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
publicly endorsed Romney's presiden-
tial candidacy.
Prior to yesterday's luncheon, Rom-
ney had been campaigning throughout
Michigan and focusing much of the
discussion on Detroit's auto industry,
particularly General Motors. GM, the
largest member of the Detroit Three
automakers, was the focus of an op-ed
written by Romney in the Detroit News
on Tuesday. In the op-ed, Romney
declared that President Barack Obama
had used "crony capitalism" to bailout
GM and Chrysler, and that he should
have instead allowed the free market
to function and force the two automak-
ers into managed bankruptcy. Romney
went on to claim that because Obama
did not allow the free market to fluctu-
ate naturally, Detroit has been unable to
recover as well as it could have.
Coincidentally, yesterday was also
the day GM released its 2011 financial
report from 2011. After a year of rebuild-
ing the company and repaying much of
its bailout money, GM reported $7.6 bil-
lion in earnings for 2011, the highest in
the company's history. Because of the
massive profit, 47,500 hourly workers
will be eligible to receive revenue-shar-
ing checks of up to $7,000. Best of all,
due to its eighth consecutive profitable
quarter, GM is once again the largest

carmaker in the world, reclaiming their
position from Toyota.
At 10:30 a.m. yesterday, one hour
prior to Romney's speech, I was finally
able to secure my seat in the designat-
ed press area and wait for the event to
start. Shares of GM were already up an
astonishing 4.13 percent. I discussed
with a fellow Daily staffer how unlucky
it was that Romney was about to speak
just hours after GM proved him wrong.
How embarrassing it was going to be
to look at this room filled with Michi-
gan voters and accept responsibility for
being wrong about the government's
role in saving the auto industry.
By 11:45 a.m., 15 minutes after Rom-
ney was supposed to speak, GM shares
were continuing to climb - they had
already risen by 5.86 percent. As is
expected of presidential candidates,
Romney was running late. I began scan-
ning through my phone.
Of the many articles concerning GM's
positive announcement, one delivered
yet another political blow for Romney.
The Economist renounced its ear-
lier support of Romney's stance on
GM's bailout. At the height of the cri-
sis, the magazine agreed with Romney:
The government shouldn't bailout the
auto industry, it instead favored man-
aged bankruptcy. Taking into account
GM's reported success, The Economist
decided it was wrong to support Rom-
ney's stance. If the government had not
stepped in, the managed bankruptcy
that the company eventually entered in
2009 could have likely ended in the col-
lapse of the entire automotive industry.
Finally, Romney entered the building

with Snyder, and after a few brief intro-
ductions, the pair stepped on stage. Like
Romney, Snyder was a venture capital-
ist prior to entering politics. Snyder
claimed that because of Romney's abili-
ty to run a successful company, Romney
was the best choice for president.
"Washington is holding Michigan
back," Snyder claimed, and voting for
a Michigander who "understands the
problems this state faces" would correct
this.
Romney was quick to accept the
blessing, explaining to the crowd why
he is a true Detroiter.
Here we go.
Finally, Romney was going to bring
up the auto industry and either explain
he was wrong or continue bashing the
bailout. Instead, Romney explained
why he loved Michigan, loved our lakes,
loved our cars and used the word love at
least an additional ten times.
"I drive a Mustang," Romney said, as
if that qualified him as patriot and presi-
dent.
It was near the very end of his speech
that Romney spoke of the auto industry.
He referred to Obama's policies as "job-
killing" and informed the crowd of his
new catchphrase, "crony capitalism,"
and its auto industry application.
Then, at last, Romney congratulated
GM for regaining its footing and claimed
that he had been "right all along."
Stunned. This man, a man who claims
that "corporations are people, too," and
that we "should allow Detroit to go
bankrupt," was standing in front of peo-
ple and news outlets claiming his theo-
ries were correct. In a desperate plea to

Michigan voters, Romney was simply liquidated and that many of its more

Spreading memes
across campuses

LSA freshman
mixes Internet
humor with
Maize and Blue
By BRIANNE JOHNSON
Daily Arts Wrtier
One does not simply launch
an Internet phenomenon in a
matter of weeks ... unless one
is LSA freshman Alex Lee, the
creator of UMich Memes. The
increasingly popular Face-
book page - and the source of
an endless stream of procras-
tination-friendly, University-
meets-pop-culture references
-hastakenthe Internet (and the
classroom) by storm, prompting
the launch of the interactive col-
lege meme-base CampusMemes.
com.
As a frostbitten "Man vs.
Wild" star Bear Grylls desper-
ately gazes into the arctic tun-
dra, he's framed by a caption
many can relate to - as long as
those many wear Maize and
Blue. "CTools is down," the
meme reads. "Better drink my
own piss." Since its launch on
Feb. 3 UMich Memes has been
driven by the shared frustrations
and obsessions (hello, Denard) of
fellow Wolverines.
Lee spent his first semes-
ter at the University interning
for Saif Altimimi, co-founder
of the note-sharing platform
NoteWagon. Due to the high
caliber of Lee's work, Altimimi
approached Lee this semester

about expanding his company
into the U.S., initiating the
cyber craze. According to Lee,
Altimimi had already amassed
a following of students to gener-
ate meme pages for universities
across Canada.
"He approached me to make (a
page) for the University of Mich-
igan ... so I was a moderator for
our page and it kind of spread out
to make meme pages across the
nation," Lee said.
Soon after the creation of
UMich Memes, its popular-
ity soared, eventually resulting
in the creation of the company
Campus Memes, of which Lee is
a co-founder.
"For Michigan, I make the
memes. I would have a contact
with the school and I would ask
them to make a couple memes
first and then invite everybody,"
Lee added. "Then ... it kind of
blew up from there and started
getting all the (Facebook) 'likes.'
Once you have about 500 people,
it kind of spirals from there, and
then people start making their
own memes."
Students are encouraged to
submit their own memes through
the UMich Memes Facebook
page, e-mail or CampusMemes.
com, an expansive collection
of nationwide college memes.
Launched on Feb. 7, Campus-
Memes is reported to have reg-
istered 30,000 users within the
first 10 minutes of its launch.
The website is a collaboration
between Altimimi, Lee, web
designer Cheryl Wu and devel-
oper Charles Cary of GREEDY-
TREES.com.

"(The overwhelming amount
of users) shut down our servers
... then obviously we got noticed
because a lot of people were
using it, and we got attacked by
4chan.... They started uploading
gore and porn all over the web-
site (and) all over the Facebook
pages, so we actually have, as of
now, a manual moderating sys-
tem," Lee said. "Any meme that
wants to get on the website, we
moderate it."
In an effort to further moder-
ate and filter submissions, Cam-
pusMemes.com allows users to
rank each meme, awarding a
grade of "pass" or "fail."
"One of the reasons why
people are getting angry and
annoyed with the whole meme
situation is because we make
memes mainstream, but people
don't understand how to use
them right and it's just not good,"
Lee said. "Our website fixes that
with the downloading system,
but it's still really annoying ...
my number one piece of advice
would be to know the meme.
Understand the meme."
But for Lee, the site's popular-
ity stems not from the Internet
meme itself, but its personal con-
nection with students.
"It's like a revolution," Lee
said. "The whole process to get
something viral is that you need
to create something that has
value. The whole point is that it
connects with people on a per-
sonal level. To be able to create
something that affects you on a
personal level and that you can
understand ... that's really the
important thing."

Late surge lifts Iowa to win

Hawkeyes' 3-point
parade erases

It didn't take long for the Mich-
igan women's basketball team's
eight-point lead late in the second
half to dis-
appear. IOWA 58
With just MICHIGAN 57
44 seconds
left to play in Thursday's game,
Iowa's Kamille Wahlin hit a go-
ahead 3-pointer.
It was the Hawkeyes' first lead
of the game.
On the ensuing possession,
the Wolverines (7-6 Big Ten, 18-8
overall) looked to put the ball in
the paint, giving it to senior guard
Carmen Reynolds.
But Reynolds' shot was
blocked and Michigan had to
send someone to the foul line to
get one more possession. Junior
guard Jenny Ryan unwisely
chose Wahlin, an 87-percent
free-throw shooter, to shoot the
1-and-1.
The Wolverines got a lucky
break.
"I wasn't too happy when it
didn't go in,"Wahlin said. "Michi-
gan took a timeout, and we went
to the bench and my teammates
* picked me up and said, 'Hey we
got your back, we're going to get
this stop.'"
As the shot clock ran down
for Michigan, Iowa (8-6, 17-10)
clogged the paint and forced
junior guard Nya Jordan to kick
the ball out to junior forward Sam
Arnold.

T he final score of the
Michigan women's bas-

Iowa on Thursday night was
58-57.
But the deciding number was

the Wolverines.

this number On Women's

blowing, it
led to a Hawkeye advantage of
16-8 in points after offensive
rebounds.
The Wolverines led by as
many as 13 points going into
the first half, but were still
dominated 10-4 in the offensive
rebounding category. But Iowa
couldn't hit the broad side of the
barn - shooting an abysmal 21.6
percent from the floor.
"When you're not shooting
the ball, you better crash," said
Iowa coach Lisa Bluder. "You've
got to crash to get those second
and third opportunities, and
I'm proud of our team for doing
that."
For Iowa, the crashing of the

boards, as Bulder said, didn't
come from the Hawkeyes' lead-
ing rebounder, 6-foot-5 junior
Morgan Johnson. It came from
freshman Samantha Logic.
Logic tallied 18 total
rebounds, nine of those coming
on the offensive glass. This gave
her a career high in the catego-
ry, as well as probably earning
her a game ball. But one player
wasn't the downfall for the Wol-
verines. The true problems were
an all-around lack of boxing
out and being undersized in the
paint. On multiple occasions,
Johnson used her size to shoot
a lay-up. Miss. Get her own
rebound and put up another
shot. Miss. Get a third consecu-
tive rebound and, finally, either
score or get fouled.
This series of plays brings
back memories of youth games,
where one tall player could

were talented or not. Unfortu-
nately for Michigan, this wasn't
a YMCA game.

Wolverines eye
rematch with
No. 22 Kentucky
on Saturday
By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
After sweeping a four-game
tournament last weekend, the
No. 11 Michigan softball team
looks to maintain its perfect
record in this weekend's Florida
Atlantic Kickoff Classic.
The Wolverines will play five
games between Friday and Sun-
day, including a pair of double-
headers. After games against
Maryland and Long Island on
Friday and No. 22 Kentucky and
Florida Atlantic on Saturday,

in last year's NCAA tournament.
As much of a disappointment as
that was, the Wolverines will
look to avenge their early exit.
Though Kentucky, is ranked
while Michigan's other four
opponents are not, the team's
mentality will not differ as they
play each game.
"Everyone competes to play,"
Chidester said. "It's just a num-
ber out there. It's not something
we really look towards."
Something the Wolverines
will look toward this weekend
will be the performance of fresh-
man pitcher Sara Driesenga, who
is coming off of a two-win week-
end, highlighted by a no-hitter
through five innings that earned
her Big Ten Freshman of the
Week honors.
Lost in Driesenga's dazzling
pitching display last week was

Junior forward Sam Arnold missed a potential game-winning 3-pointer, but shared the team lead with 12 points.

Arnold launched a 3-pointer,
and the Hawkeyes - as they had
done 27 times earlier in the game
- pulled down the defensive
rebound.
Wahlin's teammates got their
stop, and Iowa got the win,
58-57.
Arnold's shot may not have
been ideal for the Wolverines,
but they had no other options.
Iowa's defense didn't give up
any opportunities in the paint,
and Arnold was open at the top
of the key.
But Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth seemed to think a jumper
was the best choice.
"We tried to get around the
basket," he said. "We went down
with Carmen (in the previous
possession) and didn't get a foul
called, so I didn't know if I want-
ed to go under the basket again
and put it in the hands of the offi-

cials."
Regardless, it didn't work out
well for the Wolverines. Despite
12-point efforts by Arnold and
senior guard Courtney Boylan,
the team was unable to maintain
the 14-point lead it took into the
half.
After shooting at a 46-percent
clip in the first half, Michigan was
unable to keep up the pace, com-
pleting just 21 percent of its shots
in the second frame.
But Iowa smelled blood as a
result, and it was clearly the bet-
ter second-half team. Wahlin's
efforts led the Hawkeyes, as she
had 11 of her 18 points in the sec-
ond stanza, and Samantha Logic
tallied a double-double.
Logic dominated the glass
on both ends of the Crisler Cen-
ter court, pulling down 18 of the
team's 48 total rebounds. But
while Iowa was limiting Michi-

gan's offensive possessions, the
Hawkeyes were creating second-
chance opportunities of their
own.
Iowa had 16 points off of 20
offensive boards, and limiting
the Wolverine post players was
the most significant aspect of the
Hawkeyes' game plan according
to Iowa coach Lisa Bluder.
"We told them at halftime,
'We're going to win this game
with defense and rebounds,' and
that's exactly what we did in the
second half," she said.
Michigan gets another chance
to play the Hawkeyes in the last
game of the season in Iowa City.
And Borseth knows that the
team has to make a case for an
NCAA Tournamentbid.
"We've got to win the last one
- that's the one you want to win,"
he said. "Because that's the one
the committee looks at."

Ids were the difference

ties at the end of the game to
hit a game winner, it wasn't the
only reason. Almost every sec-
ond-chance opportunity result-
ed in either an Iowa basket, free
throw or another miss.
But this isn't a new problem
for Michigan. All season, the
Wolverines lack of size has
tormented them against bigger
teams, especially those in the
Big Ten. They play a help-ori-
ented defense to limit opposing
post players. At 6-foot-2, junior
forward Rachel Sheffer fronts
the post and relies on backside
help from the guards.
On Thursday, this strategy
seemed to work in the first
half, as Michigan tallied nine
turnovers. Problems arose
when the ball got into the post,
because it seemed the Wolver-
ines only option was to hack-a-
shaq.

he did have 15 points of its potential weaknesses, doing

a poor job of defending the high
ball screen. Michigan runs the
screen regularly with freshman
point guard Trey Burke, and if the
Wolverines can exploit it on Sat-
urday, their chances of winning
will go up dramatically.
Burke had a decent game the
last time the teams squared off,
going 5-for-11 from the field, but
he struggled - as did his team-
mates - with Ohio State's length.
The Buckeye trio of 6-foot-9
Jared Sullinger, 6-foot-7 DeShaun

Buford consistently disrupted
Burke's penetration the last time

Ohio State still has that length,

"He is a tre-

Beilein said. "He plays like a
senior that prioritizes winning,
prioritizes defense and prioritizes
making the next pass. ... (Novak
and senior guard Stu Douglass)
feel the game before the opponent
does, and Craft is a specialist at

that."
On the other side of the ball,
the Wolverines have held their
last two opponents to 39-percent
shooting. But reboundingremains
a problem, and Ohio State abused
Michigan in that area last time,
especially on the offensive glass.
Beilein, too, still hasn't fig-
ured out a way to fully contain
Sullinger, who's a favorite to be
named first team All-Big Ten at
the end of the season.
But the Michigan coach has
had plenty of time to devise a
defensive plan to help stymie the
Buckeyes.
The Wolverines have been off a
full six days, resting and prepar-
ing for Ohio State - their longest
such period since winter break in
December.
Beilein said he planned to treat
the first few days like training
camp, focusing on his team only,
before beginning to prep for the
Buckeyes later in the week.
In a bit of a surprise, the usu-
ally reserved Beilein also admit-
ted that he'd be addressing the
fact that a Big Ten championship
is within reach for Michigan. It'd
be the team's first conference title
since 1986.
"(The team) knows the stand-
ings, so you just do the math and
see right away, if you win, we have
a great opportunity here against
a great team."
Michigan has done much this
season to confirm its standing as
a program to be reckoned with
again. In primetime on Saturday,
the Wolverines have an opportu-
nity to prove it to the nation.

getting pretty sad about it,"
Pateryn said. "It's (our) favorite
place to play in the country....
It's kind of weird to think about
how yot were just a freshman a
few years ago."
When Michigan (12-8-4
CCHA,18-10-4 overall) traveled
to Marquette for an October
series against the Wildcats (9-9-
6, 14-10-6), conference play got
off to a rocky start. In the series

opener, Wolverine fifth-year
senior goaltender Shawn Hun-
wick was ejected for throwing a
punch in a second-period brawl.
Northern Michigan plans on
keeping its emotions in check
while playing in a hostile envi-
ronment this weekend, with six
critical CCHA points hanging
in the balance.
"I think it's good that there's
a rivalry between us," said
Wildcat senior forward Andrew
Cherniwchan in an interview
with ESPN 970. "(It) brings a
lot of emotion to the game. But
at the same time, you can't let
your emotions get the best of
you and you just got to keep a
level head."
Cherniwchan went on to say
that he feels the Wolverines are
usually the instigators.
"We're hard working and
we're physical," Cherniwchan
said. "Sometimes they take
offense to that."
Awaiting Northern Michi-
gan after its long bus ride from
the Upper Peninsula will be a
team that hardly resembles the
one that the Wildcats took four
out of six points from in Octo-
ber. Michigan's leaders have
emerged, and Hunwick knows
he can't afford to lose his head
and place his team in a vulner-
able position.
In his weekly film session,
what stood out the most to
Michigan coach Red Berenson

was the Wildcats' special-teams
prowess. Northern Michigan
ranks near the top of the CCHA
in both power-play and penalty-
kill percentages. But to Beren-
son, it's just another stage of a
gauntlet through tough special
teams opponents recently.
"Every week, we look at
another team with good special
teams," Berenson said. "Notre
Dame, Miami (Ohio), Michigan
State - and now Northern."
Wednesday, the Wolve-ines
ran a 5-on-3 drill, rotating play-
ers from offense to defense to
simulate a tough kill or a crucial
man advantage.
"In practice, you can stop the
drill and figure things out," said
junior forward Lindsay Sparks.
"In the games, you can't really
do that. So it's a good tool."
During the series in Mar-
quette, the Wolverines strug-
gled to find the net on the
power play, going 0-for-6 with
an extra skater in the Friday
night loss to the Wildcats. The
next night wasn't much better,
though Michigan did manage a
shootout win. In that game, it
was the penalty kill's shortcom-
ings that made the difference,
as Northern Michigan notched
two power-play goals.
"It's the little things on spe-
cial teams," Pateryn said. "I
think what it comes down to is
our work ethic."
Berenson scoffed when asked

if special teams will determine
the winner this weekend - "It
usually decides weekends," he
said. But for this one, it seems
especially important that the
Wolverines manage to cut down
penalties, which have engulfed
them at their worst this season.
He also expects emotions
to play only a marginal role on
senior night. Berenson believes
the tears and memories are best
saved for the last time his skat-
ers take their jerseys off. With
playoff positioning - as well
as an outside shot at the CCHA
title - on the line, Michigan
should have all the incentive
it needs to earn another home
series in March.
