STATE LEGISLAfURE
After brief
shutdown,
deal passed
30-day temporary budget averts
crisis, but big problems remain
LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Michigan's brief partial
government shutdown is over after lawmakers voted
to adopt a temporary 30-day budget.
The move early Thursday morning avoids tempo-
rary state worker layoffs and state office closures. It
also delays tough decisions on more permanent spend-
ing cuts in one of the nation's most economically bat-
tered states.
The continuation budget is headed to Democratic
Gov. Jennifer Granholm.
The move came just less than two hours after offi-
cials started a partial government shutdown. Lawmak-
ers had failed to pass a permanent budget before the
midnight Wednesday deadline.
The shutdown was a couple of hours shorter than
the last one in 2007.
The deal was reached after the legislature remained
without a budget at its midnight deadline last night and
stumbled into a partial government shutdown Thurs-
day as Michigan lawmakers failed to agree on a spend-
ing plan.
A deal to fill a nearly $3 billion shortfall with federal
recovery dollars and more than $1 billion in cuts fell
through, as many lawmakers discovered they couldn't
stomach deep cuts to schools and local services such as
police and fire protection in the stricken state.
They also failed to finalize a temporary budget and
avert Michigan's second shutdown since 2007.
Secretary of State offices were set to close Thursday
and state parks prepared to ask visitors to leave if the
impasse remained when state workers were supposed
to report for work. Essential services such as state
police and prisons were to remain running.
"We have taken steps to put a shutdown in place,"
Liz Boyd, a spokeswoman for Democratic Gov. Jen-

Demonstrators protest outside the Blind Pig to voice their opposition to the performance of Buju Banton yesterday. Despite efforts to get the show cancelled, the concert went on as planned.
Protestors rally at Blind Pig

Demonstrators, mayor
speak out against
artist's anti-gay lyrics
By LIBBY ASHTON
For the Daily
Despite community pressure to
cancel the scheduled performance of
controversial reggae artist Buju Ban-
ton, the show went on last night at the
Blind Pig.
But while Banton was inside the club
setting up for a sound check, dozens
of protesters gathered outside in the
early evening to wave signs reading

"WWMD: What Would Marley Do?"
and "Say NO To Blind Pigotry."
Chris Armstrong, Michigan Student
Assembly LGBT Commission Chair and
an attendee at the rally, said the fact the
Blind Pig allowed the show to go on is
especially hurtful because of how much
the LGBT community has supported
the establishment in the past.
"We were hoping that the Blind Pig
would cancel the show and they didn't,"
Armstrong said. "A lot of people come
to U of M because it's so accepting, and
it has an amazing LGBT community.
The Blind Pig has been a part of that."
Banton has been criticized for lyrics
in his song "Boom Bye-Bye," in which
Banton raps about shooting gay men

with guns and, as some argue, burning
their skin with acid. His shows have
been cancelled at many venues across
the country, most recently in Detroit at
the Majestic Theatre.
Many of last night's protestors con-
tacted the Blind Pig in hopes that offi-
cials at the venue would cancel the
show. But when the club decided not to
cancel the show, Social Work student
Lindsey McKinney decided to organize
a protest.
"My panties are in a bundleasashould
everyone else's," McKinney said, refer-
encing a quote in yesterday's edition of
the Daily in which Faith Wood, gen-
eral manager of the Blind Pig, said she
wished people better understood the

issue they were getting "their panties
in a bundle" about.
Last night, The Blind Pig issued
a statement staffers printed off and
taped to the doors and windows of the
building defending the venues decision
to allow Banton to play.
"We have come to the conclusion
that this artist does not support the
point of view that he put forward in
his controversial song," which he made
when he was 15 years old, the flier read.
"And that, to the contrary, his current
performances are celebrated by many
because of the powerfully positive mes-
sages he puts forward at his concert."

'U' scientists develop drug to
ease pains from the battlefield

Students making their way to
last Saturday's football game may
have detected something different
about their usual route to the sta-
dium. The houses in the 900 block
of South State Street, usually the
epitome of pre-game celebrations
on campus, were noticeably less
festive in the wake of "cease and
desist" letters sent by the Ann
Arbor City Attorney's Office last
week.
LSA senior Alex Girard, a resi-
dent of 933 S. State St. - better
known as the BOX House - said
although residents of the house
started partying at 5:30 a.m. like
any regular football Saturday,
the tailgate was not "business as
usual."
"It was pretty much killed," he
said. "(The Police) showed up and
gave everyone on the street public
nuisance tickets."
Kristen Larcom, senior assistant
city attorney, sent a letter to the
houses of the 900 block of South
State Street last Tuesday threat-
ening lawsuits from the city if the
houses continued to engage in
"illegal and dangerous conduct."

New drug seeks to
limit downside of
taking morphine
By BETHANY BIRON
For the Daily
For wounded combat soldiers
on the front lines of this nation's
wars, pain relief requires a deli-
cate balance.

One primary option is morphine
- the well-known painkiller just
as well-known for its hazardous
side effects, which include slowed
breathing, slowed heart rate, sei-
zure, convulsion, severe weakness
or dizziness, lightheadedness and
fainting.
But on the battlefield, those side
effects can be dangerous and, at
times, deadly.
That is until anew drug- geared
toward reducing the downside

of the painkiller - and currently
being developed by researchers at
the University.
The research team, led by Dr.
James Baker, director of the Michi-
gan Nanotechnology Institute for
Medicine and Biological Sciences,
aimsto minimize morphines poten-
tially hazardous and even fatal side
effects with the implementation of

The great alcohol divide

Students today know
Division Street as the road
that runs parallel to State
Street, but not many real-
ize its name used to mean
something.
In 1903, the city of Ann
Arbor literally divided the
town by prohibiting the
sale of alcohol in all estab-
lishments east of Divi-
sion Street, and allowing
it to the west, according
to the Ann Arbor District
Library's website.
"The dry line was what
they called it," said Wystan
Stevens, a 1970 University
graduate and lifetime Ann
Arbor resident.
John MarwilAnnArbor
historical expert and his-
tory lecturer at the Univer-

sity, said binge drinking
on campus is nothing new,
hence the implementation
of the line.
"There was really quite
serious drinking on this
campus for a really long
time in the late 19th and
early 20th century," he
said. "Drinking habits in
the country involved an
extraordinary amount of
drinking of hard liquor and
whiskey."
The beginning of the
temperance movement at
the University began in the
mid-to-late 1800s when
students and University
officialsbeganto notice the
negative effects of alcohol
among students.
At a temperance meet-

ing held at the Washtenaw
County Courthouse in
1845 - documented in the
book "Ann Arbor The First
Hundred Years" by OW.
Stephenson - a senior at
the University said it was
"the duty of every inhabit-
ant of the village to exert
an influence in favor of
order and strict morality;
and that to make this effi-
ciently they should neither
make, use, nor vend intoxi-
cating liquors."
Like many other college
campuses during the tem-
perance movement, the
University became a place
of great concern and con-
troversy over consumption
of alcohol.
Stevens said it led to vis-

its from radical speakers
and pro-temperance activ-
ists like Carrie Nation, a
famous pro-prohibitionist
who was known for her
ruthless antics that includ-
ed stealing rum bottles
from bars and smashing
bottles of hard liquor.
Eventually, the division
lost meaning. But the name
stuck.
"There was kind of a
general loosening up of the
rules around here, about
the time the Vietnam War
protest got started and
people weren't going to
tolerate restrictions on
liberties, especially if not
universally applied," Ste-
vens said.

Hellerstein cites
national security
in ruling
NEW YORK (AP) - A judge
cited national security concerns
in ruling yesterday that the CIA
does not have to release hun-
dreds of documents related to the
destruction of videotapes of Sept.
11 detainee interrogations that
used harsh methods.
U.S. District Judge Alvin K.
Hellerstein said he believed he
had an obligation to let the CIA
director decide what should be
released when it pertains to meth-
ods used to make uncooperative
detainees divulge information.
"The need to keep confidential
just how the CIA and other gov-
ernment agencies obtained their
information is manifest, and
that has to do with the identities
of the people who gave informa-
tion and who were questioned to
obtain information," the judge
said from the bench.
He ruled after reviewing in
private 65 of roughly 580 docu-
ments sought by the American
Civil Liberties Union, including
53 field reports to CIA head-
quarters about interrogations.
An ACLU lawsuit already
has forced the release of legal
memos authorizing harsh Meth-
ods, including waterboarding, a
type of simulated drowning, and
slamming suspects into walls,
techniques described by critics
as torture.
The judge said he expects to
order the release of six pages of
written notes from a CIA field
officer who spoke about the
interrogation videotapes with
a CIA lawyer, but he gave the
government two weeks to sub-
mit new arguments opposing the
release.
He said it was only impor-
tant that he decide whether the
issue before him was a fit subject
for intelligence gathering, not
whether it was legal.
"If so, my job is to defer to the
extent appropriate - and that is
substantial - to the decision of
the director of the CIA," he said.
CIA Director Leon Panet-
ta had told the judge in court
papers that releasing documents

about the agency's terror inter-
rogations would gravely damage
national security.
The judge said he believes
he would have used the same
rationale to rule against pub-
lic disclosure of the videotapes
documenting new harsh ques-
tioning techniques if the CIA had
not -destroyed them in 2005. A
criminal investigation into why
the videotapes were destroyed
continues.
The judge, who presides over
thousands of lawsuits filed after
the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, said
he reached his conclusions in the
CIA case after more "agony of
decision-making" than any other
area he has ruled upon. He said
he studied earlier judicial rulings
and concluded "there has been
a reluctance on the part of the
courts to interfere with the dis-
cretion conferred by the mandate
of the statutes on the CIA."
The judge, though, said that
the CIA has to obey laws, and he
cautioned: "We have to square
what we do in the gathering of
intelligence with who we are as a
people."
ACLU lawyer Alex Abdo, who
argued in the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act case, said he was dis-
appointed.
"We were surprised at the level
of deference to continue to main-
tain the secrecy of a program the
president himself has declassi-
fied," Abdo said. "This is a new
level of deference to the CIA's
decision to withhold information
about an interrogation program
the whole world knows about."
He said the ACLU would
review its options before deciding
whether to appeal.
Government lawyer Sean Lane
declined to comment.
The government has said
92 videotapes were destroyed, A
including interrogations of al-
Qaida lieutenant Abu Zubaydah
and another al-Qaida leader. The
destruction was revealed nearly
two years ago.
The administration of Presi-
dent George W. Bush had said
some tapes were destroyed to
protect the identities of the gov-
ernment questioners while the
Department of Justice was debat-
ing whether the interrogation
tactics were legal.

Small plane goes
down after pilot

A single-engine plane crashed
into an Indiana cornfield Wednes-

slumped over at the controls, lost
consciousness and the aircraft flew
out of control, officials said.
Military officials do not believe
the crash was terrorism-related but
instead said the pilot may have had
a health problem or been suffering
from a lack of oxygen. F-16s under
direction of U.S. North American
Aerospace Defense Command inter-

about an houruntil it crashed.
Indiana State Police Sgt. Rod

the body is positively identified. No

High Court to decide
state gun rights case

Thousands more
trapped in rubble
following landslides
PADANG, Indonesia (AP) - A
powerful earthquake that struck
western Indonesia triggered land-
slides and trapped thousands of
people under collapsed buildings
- including two hospitals, officials
said.Atleast200bodieswere found
in one coastal city and the toll was
expected tobe far higher.
The temblor yesterday started
fires, severed roads and cut off
power and communications to
Padang, a coastal city of 900,000
on Sumatra island. Thousands fled
in panic, fearing a tsunami.
Buildings swayed hundreds of
miles (kilometers) away in neigh-
boring Malaysia and Singapore.
In the sprawling low-lying city
of Padang, the shaking was so
intense that people crouched or
sat on the street to avoid falling.
Children screamed as an exodus of
thousands tried to get away from
the coast in cars and motorbikes,
honking horns.
At least 500buildings in Padang,
the regional capital, collapsed or
were badly damaged, said Disaster
Management Agency spokesman
Priyadi Kardono, adding that 200
bodies had been pulled from the

rubble there.
The extent of damage in sur-
rounding areas was still unclear
due to poor communications, he
said.
Padang's mayor appealed for
assistance on Indonesian radio sta-
tion el-Shinta.
"We are overwhelmed with vic-
tims and ... lack of clean water, elec-
tricity and telecommunications,"
Mayor Fauzi Bahar said. "We really
need help. We call on people to
come to Padang to evacuate bodies
and help the injured."
Hundreds of people were
trapped under collapsed buildings
in Padang alone, including a four-
star hotel, he said.
The magnitude 7.6 quake hit
at 5:15 p.m. (1015 GMT, 6:15 a.m.
EDT), just off the coast of Padang,
the U.S. Geological Survey report-
ed. It occurred a day after a killer
tsunami hit islands in the South
Pacific and was along the same
fault line that spawned the 2004
Asian tsunami that killed 230,000
people ina dozen nations.
A tsunami warning was issued
Wednesday for countries along
the Indian Ocean, but was lifted
after about an hour; there were no
reports of giant waves.
The shaking flattened build-
ings and felled trees in Padang,
damaged mosques and hotels and
crushed cars.

Case could overturn
local gun control laws
across the country
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court said Wednesday it
will consider a challenge to Chi-
cago's ban on handguns, opening
the way for a ruling that could set
off a vigorous new fight over state
and local gun controls across the
nation.
A victory for gun-rights propo-
nents in the Chicago case is consid-
ered likely, even by supporters of
gun control. If the court rules that
the Second Amendment right to
keep and bear arms doesn't allow
the city's outright handgun ban,
it could lead to legal challenges to
less-restrictive laws that limit who
may own guns, whether firearms
must be registered and even how
they must be stored.
The court last year moved in
the direction of voiding tough gun
control laws when it struck down
a prohibition on handguns in the
District of Columbia, a city with
unique federal status. Now the
court will decide whether that rul-
ing should apply to local and state
laws as well. The court will hear
arguments in the case early next
year, and a ruling probably would
follow in the spring.
The court has said previously
that most, but not all, rights laid
out in the Constitution's Bill of
Rights serve as checks on state
as well as federal restrictions.
Separately, 44 state constitutions
already enshrine gun rights.
Though faced with potential
limits from the high court on their
ability to enact laws and regula-
tions in this area, 34 statesweighed
in on the gun-rights side before
the justices agreed to take the case
Wednesday, an indication of the
enduring strength of the National
Rifle Association and its allies.
The gun case was among sev-
eral the court added to its docket
for the term that begins Monday.
Others include:
- A challenge to part of a law
that makes it a crime to provide
financial and other aid to any
group designated a terrorist orga-
nization.
- A dispute over when new,

harsher penalties can be given to
sex offenders who don't register
with state sex offender databases.
- Whether to throw out a
human rights lawsuit against a
former prime minister of Soma-
lia who is accused of overseeing
killings and other atrocities. The
issue is whether a federal law gives
the former official, Mohamed Ali
Samantar, immunity from lawsuits
in U.S. courts.
In the gun case, outright hand-
gun bans appear to be limited to
Chicago and suburban Oak Park,
Ill. But a ruling against those ordi-
nances probably would "openup all
the gun regulations in the country
to constitutional scrutiny, of which
there are quite a few," said Mark
Tushnet, a Harvard Law School
professor whose recent book "Out
of Range" explores the often bitter
national debate over guns.
Already, Alan Gura, who led the
legal challenge to the Washington
law and represents the plaintiff in
Chicago, is suing to overturn the
District of Columbia's prohibition
on carrying firearms outside a per-
son's home. Illinois and Wisconsin
have similar restrictions.
In voiding Washington's hand-
gun ban last year, Justice Antonin
Scalia suggested that gun rights,
like the right to speech, are limited
and that many gun control mea-
sures could remain in place.
Ultimately, said Tushnet, the
court will have to decide, possibly
restriction by restriction, which
limits are reasonable.
"It's very hard to know where
this court would draw the line
between reasonable and unrea-
sonable,"he said.
NRA Executive Vice President
Wayne LaPierre said he hopes the
court rules that "core fundamental
freedoms like speech, religion and,
we believe, the right to keep and
bear arms are intended to apply to
every individual in the country."
Paul Helmke, president of the
Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun
Violence, said the court's deci-
sion to take up the new case was
unsurprising in light of last year's
ruling.
These cases should "take the
extremes off the table," Helmke
said, referring to bans on guns
and unlimited gun rights. "What's
critical for us is how the court

goes about fleshing out what the
limits are."
Mayor Michael Bloomberg of
New York, which under state law
requires handgun permits and a
safety course, said he hopes the
court brings clarity to gun laws.
"My hope is that they will decide
that reasonable restrictions, which
I think is the way most reasonable
people in this country think, are
appropriate," Bloomberg said.
The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Chicago had upheld the
gun bans as legitimate expressions
of local and state rights.
Judge Frank Easterbrook, an
appointee of President Ronald Rea-
gan, wrote in the ruling that "the
Constitution establishes a federal
republic where local differences
are to be cherished as elements of
liberty rather than extirpated in
order to produce a single, nation-
ally applicable rule."
"Federalismis an older and more
deeply rooted tradition than is a
right to carry any particular kind
of weapon," Easterbrook wrote.
Evaluating arguments over the
extension of the Second Amend-
ment is a job "for the justices rather
than a court of appeals," he said.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, then
an appeals court judge, was part
of a three-judge panel in New York
that reached a similar conclusion
in January.
The high court took the sugges-
tion Wednesday.
Judges on both courts - Repub-
lican nominees in Chicago and
Democratic nominees in New York
- said only the Supreme Court
could decide whether to extend
last year's ruling throughout the
country.
The New York ruling also has
been challenged, but the court did
not act on it Wednesday. Sotomay-
or would have to sit out any case
involving decisions she was part of
on the appeals court. Although the
issue is the same in the Chicago
case, there is no ethical bar to her
participation in its consideration
by the Supreme Court.
She replaced Justice David
Souter, who dissented in the 5-4
Washington case, so the five-jus-
tice majority remains intact.

War council talks
Afghanistan plan

Military officials
push for troop
increases, division
emerges
WASHINGTON (AP) -
"President wrack Obama sum-
moned his war council to the
White House Situation Room
on yesterday for an intense,
three-hour discussion that
exposed emerging fault lines
over Afghanistan - with mili-
tary commanders pressing for
more troops and other key offi-
cials expressing skepticism.
There was no discussion
of specific troop levels dur-
ing the meeting in the West
Wing basement, according to a
senior administration official.
But the talks underscored the
divisions throughout Obama's
inner circle that must be navi-
gated in the coming weeks, the
official said.
Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton and special
Afghan and Pakistan envoy
Richard Holbrooke appeared
to be leaning toward support-

ing a troop increase, said the offi-
cial, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity because the discus-
sions were private. The official,
who attended the meeting, based
the assessment on the tone and
substance of their participation.
White House Chief of Staff
Rahm Emanuel and Gen. James
Jones, Obama's natiha1 sedrity
adviser, appeared to be skeptical of
troop increases, the official said.
No firm or final recommen-
dations were offered to Obama,
the official said, suggesting that
views were still evolving.
The differences are not new
and they were aired civilly in the
meeting, the official said. But for
most of Obama's advisers, this
was the first time they exchanged
views in person - rather than
via official channels and media
leaks - and in a large group that
included the president.
The meeting, the second of
at least five Obama has planned
as he reviews his Afghanistan
strategy, comes after Obama
received a critical assessment of
the war effort from Gen. Stanley
McChrystal, the man he put in
charge of the Afghan war earlier
this year.

Research rewards
University research creates jobs, grows the economy
or Michigan, research means economic growth. At a time
when the state economy is failing and the state govern-
ment's revenue sources are dwindling, investing in the work
of research universities is a necessity. According to a report commis-
sioned by the University Research Corridor, Michigan's economy
increased by 1500 percent because of its investment in university
research - a fact that slash-happy state legislators should keep in
mind as they attempt to predict the state's financial future. Research
universities are injecting needed jobs and growth into the economy,
and they deserve continued support from the state.

The guy just cares so much about the institution.
I mean, that's what he told us."
- Charles Gifford, a board member of Bank of America, commenting on the resignation of CEO Kenneth Lewis,
who recently came under fire for possibly illegal practices, as reported yesterday by the New York Times.
A ha i-assed alternative

The URC is a coalition of the state's
research universities - Michigan State Uni-
versity, Wayne State University and the Uni-
versity of Michigan - formed in 2006. The
report, conducted by the Anderson Econom-
ic Group, showed a total of $1.4 billion was
spent on research in the 2008 fiscal year. of
that, $880 million came from state appropri-
ations and the rest was funded through fed-
eral money and local organizations. The URC
generated an estimated $14.5 billion for the
state's economy through job opportunities
and estimated alumni earnings. It also cre-
ated 28 startup companies over a 12-month
period.- up 10 percent from 2007 - and has
swelled $1.6 billion since the inception of the
URC.
The study shows that funding higher edu-
cation, and particularly research, is not an
irrational or idealistic idea, but one that dra-
matically benefits the state. In additionto the
potential to cure diseases and develop alter-
native energy solutions, funding research
creates jobs and attracts employers to the
state. It also brings Michigan an intrinsic
respect and vitality that gets people inter-
ested in living and conducting business in
the state. The opportunities provided by the
URC can help foster this kind of community.
The fact that research is important is no
surprise to University of Michigan students
and faculty, many of whom chose this school

in part because of its research reputation
and opportunities. More than 1000 fresh-
men and sophomores alone participate in the
Undergraduate Research Opportunity Pro-
gram, a program that allows them to spend
a year working with faculty on cutting-edge
research. Opportunities like this to provide
hands-on learning are attractive to aspiring
minds, and bring more faculty and students
here.
But as it stands, the state's universities are
like oases in a desert of unemployment. The
wealth this state once derived from manu-
facturing is gradually vanishing. Many ofthe
tasks performed by working-class Michigan-
ders are too easily shipped to places where
labor and resources are cheaper. The value
of the state shifting from manufacturing to
research-based fields is hard to overestimate.
Wayne State's research on biodiesel develop-
ment, Michigan State's on biomass conser-
vation and the University of Michigan's on
organic solar cells have all contributed to
economic development by promoting jobs in
alternative energy fields.
As important as it may be for the state gov-
ernment to spend responsibly, money is never
more valuable than when in the hands of the
best and brightest innovators. Both state and
federal governments should do their part to
support research in the university setting
and the opportunities it provides.

When I first walked into
East Quad upon my recent
return to Ann Arbor, I was
pleasantly sur-
prised by much of
the dorm's summer
renovation. The
lobby's new color
scheme was mark-
edly more tasteful
and the new wood
floors in many of - - '
the rooms were aM
needed upgrade MATTHEW
fromtheghastly,old GREEN
linoleum. But when
I walked out of the
new basement laundry room to find
that the Halfway Inn had been closed,
I had to do a double take. I could see
the need for certain improvements in
the structure of the cafe, but to remove
it entirely seemed extreme.
For those who are perhaps unfamil-
iar with the East Quad of old, the Half-
way Inn was a retail-dining spot in
the basement of the dormitory. It was
dubbed "the Halfass" as a joke refer-
ence to the lovably lukewarm attitude
its workers had toward efficiently pre-
paring food. But in fairness, the delay
in food preparation probably had more
to do with inadequate kitchen resourc-
es rather than the indifference of the
staff.
The food, though hardly dietetic,
was both well prepared and pleasing
to undergraduate palates. And the
ambience was everything one would
expect from a caf6 in the basement
of the quirky Residential College. An
old piano sat in a corner of the room,
against wallslined with eclectic record
album covers. Couches and comfy
chairs, in addition to standard cafete-
ria tables, created a community caf6
feel out of an otherwise institutional
space. And the odd, alternative music

that often issued from a stereo in the
kitchen was a reminder that the Hal-
fass was a place in which conformity
was not required of anyone.
Yes, that's a predictable, clich6 sen-
timent from a student in the RC. But
East Quad's distinctive history as a
haven for unconventional students is
an important consideration that Uni-
versity Housingseemstoignore. Hous-
ing believes that by converting one of
the two ground floor dining halls into
a new retail dining cafe, it is recreat-
ing a center for dormitory recreation.
In some regards, it has succeeded -
there are more tables in its substitute
cafe, for example, and residents do buy
food there. But it has failed in main-
taining the time-honored tradition
of offering made-to-order food. And
more importantly, it has eliminated -
the offbeat flair that made the Halfass
worthwhile.
The University certainly has the
right to make structural changes to
retail dining, but in moving away from
the Halfass, the University has ignored
the caf6's other function of providing
a cultural center for the RC. I under-
stand that the intended purpose of the
Halfway Inn was to provide snacks
and necessities to East Quad residents,
and not simply to cater to the implicit
and unusual needs of the Residential
College. But students with alterna-
tive interests are already relegated to
the periphery by a University culture
that deifies football players. They need
a place where they can be comfortable
in their own skin.
At the moment, the Halfass still
exists as the home of the East Quad
Music Co-op. The EQMC will keep it
breathing as the last vestige of the glo-
rious, old East Quad until some distant
Housing official decides that this is
no longer a reason to keep the facil-
ity maintained. But this is not good

enough.Housingshouldkeeptheneeds
of East Quad's historically uncommon
students in mind and reverse the deci-
sion to remove retail dining from the
Halfass.
If that proves too costly, then they
ought to at least bring back the tradi-
tion of prepared-to-order food to their
new caf. This was a staple of the erst-
while Halfass, and since the current
facility has an even greater capacity
than the basement kitchen to prepare
ordered items, there's no reason why
such food cannot be offered. More-
over, the new cafe should be decorated
and furnished in a way that caters to
its community. Housing ought to let
East Quad residents paint murals on
the walls, perhaps, as administrators
permit in the residential hallways.
'U' should change
its plans for the
quirky cafe.
Lastly, I've heard that many in
Housing were upset by the seemingly
disrespectful name, "Halfass." But as
freshmen male residents are quick to
point out, the new name, "The Other
Way Inn" is embarrassingly sugges-
tive. Though I think this name evokes
colorful imagery, I think a different I
name might suit it better. It's sad that
Housing found the "Halfass" moniker
so objectionable. Because more than
ever before, that name seems fitting
for the retail dining option Housing is
currently offering us.

Daily misinterprets LGBT City Place housing isn't
issues in Banton article worth the historical losses

I
I

TO THE DAILY:
I was so excited to see that the Daily decided
to cover the Buju Banton concert controversy,
and I appreciate the attention to LGBT issues
on campus (Blind Pig: Controversial act still on,
09/30/2009). But I was very disappointed in
what was missing from the article. I can see the
value in including the perspective of Ms. Woods
in the discussion, but her statements completely
misrepresent the complexity of this issue. I wish
your writer had done his own research to counter
them.
Buju Banton still performs, and proudly ref-
erences, "Boom Bye-Bye," which clearly contra-
dicts the argument that he has moved away from
the beliefs he held when he wrote it 20 years ago.
Also, since his signing of the Reggae Compassion
Act two years ago, he has publicly denied signing
it so that he can continue to include hate speech
in his performances.
Your article concerns me because it plays
directly into a troubling trend on campus, which
is to discount LGBT activism as whiny, petty
and over-reactive. We did do our research. We
live this hate every day, and we have the right to
speak out about it.

TO THE DAILY:
Regarding Monday's editorial, I agree that
providing housing for all types of people is an
admirable goal (From the Daily: Defeat by delay,
09/28/2009).
However, the Daily should note that the seven
houses proposed for demolition by City Place
already provide affordable housing right now for
students. New housing is more expensive than
older housing, and anything new on that site will
increase the cost of rent. The historic houses pro-
vide green lawns and large trees - adding to the
"green" aspects already in place. There is no need
to dump tons of construction debris in a landfill if
we preserve what is already there.
We have a win-win situation with affordable
housing for students and preserving important
historic buildings. The houses are connected
to important figures in Ann Arbor history that
have given names to our streets and schools and
provided a link to the past that many residents
appreciate.
I would also note that the city has approved an
affordable housing project on North Main Street.
In the long run, the city is better off without City
Place.
Susan Wineberg
Alum

his September marked an
important breakthrough in
sexual health: an FDA panel
recommended
Gardasil, the HPV
vaccine, for males
ages nine through
26. Last semester,
I wrote multiple
columns about the
fact that although
men and women
have equal chances ROSE
of getting genital
warts - a symp- AFRIYIE
tom of HPV - they
don't have equal
access to testing or vaccinations.
Accurate tests and vaccinations are
available for women but not widely
available for men. Being the equality
advocate that I am, when I learned
that the vaccines would now be rec-
ommended for both sexes, I started to
do an Irish dance - yes, like the ones
in the River Dance commercials that
air at 5 a.m. - but halted mid-step.
It's not my intent to do an about-
face on this issue, but now that the
vaccine is almost here I am totally
conflicted. On one hand, men should
take their sexual health more seri-
ously because of how life-threatening
health outcomes can affect them and,
for heterosexuals, their female part-
ners. The introduction of this vac-
cine gives men an incentive to invest
in their sexual health. But there are
drawbacks when considering the
decision making of Merck, the mak-
ers of Gardasil, and the circumstanc-
es surrounding how money has been
spent to advocate for the vaccine. So,
allow me to interrupt the non-stop
vaccine related content dedicated to
the swine flu to tackle the business of
Gardasil.
My beef with Gardasil is really a
beef with the unethical practices of
Merck, the pharmaceutical giant that
currently has a monopoly over the
HPV vaccine in the U.S. A report pub-
lished in an Aug. 27 edition of Busi-

ness Week reminded us of Merck's
decision in 2006 and 2007 to lobby
lawmakers to make the vaccine man-
datory in some states. To boot, the
article notes that we still aren't in the
know about long-term effects of Gar-
dasil.
other ethical questions arise when
we consider how health care provid-
ers have been influenced by Merck's
monetary muscle. A report in an Aug.
19 issue of the Journal of the Ameri-
can Medical Association revealed
that Merck doled out grants to profes-
sional medical organizations, which
ostensibly promoted medical profes-
sionals to advocate for Gardasil. This
report also noted that Merck's strat-
egy put an increasing focus on all
women and not populations that were
most at risk to contract HPV.
Perhaps most intriguing is the
need for critical questions that evalu-
ate vaccination against preventative
testing - something that men still
lack in the case of HPV. This was
best captured by Dr. Diane Harper,
director of the Gynecologic Cancer
Prevention Research Group at Dart-
mouth, who was featured in a Los
Angeles Times report that ran last
year on Aug. 11. "If we vaccinate every
single 12-year-old, it should reduce by
half the number of cervical cancers
in the next 35 years... (but) with Pap
screening, we've reduced it by nearly
75%," she said. Knowing that, this is
my formal plea to Merck to invest in
HPV testing for men if they haven't
already started to do so.
But to Merck's credit, Gardasil
can't be all bad if it is one formality
away from being widely available for
men. A CNN report that ran on Sep.
9 noted that clinical trials revealed
a 90 percent reduction in the infec-
tion of genital warts and cancerous
lesions. Further, in an interview with
Medical Director of UHS Dr. Robert
Ernst, he confirmed, "The vaccine in
men would help to prevent the spread
of HPV to susceptible women, and
therefore indirectly help to reduce

the likelihood of cervical cancer in
women." He also noted that Gardasil
would vaccinate against penile can-
cers and gay men will have an oppor-
tunity to prevent strands of HPV that
could possibly cause anal cancers.
Gardasil for women at UHS costs
$173 per shot when you include
the health care provider's fee. Side
effects from the vaccine include pain
where you get the shot and a low-
grade fever.
Men should start
thinking about
sexual health, too.
I
Beyond these facts are also key
advantages. First, it's important to
note that the college setting makes
it easy to get vaccinations. It's acces-
sible to go to UHS because it's on
campus and it's relatively simple to
book an appointment. In the real
world, you may have to travel miles
away from your residence and cram
three appointments in between your
nine-to-five work schedule. Second,
for both men and women, getting the
vaccine can be a gateway to checking
up on other aspects of your sexual
health and asking your provider sex-
ual health questions.
Lastly, perhaps most obvious, it
will be really hard for you to contract
genital warts - an infection that con-
doms won't protect you from but the
vaccine will. Not getting warts isn't
just good for your health but also
your genital self-esteem. I can see
the Merck commercials now: "With
penis size anxiety and maintaining
an erection, you'll have one less thing
to worry about: warts!"

Finding peace n a kick
How one game-winning field goal prepared a former Wolverine for a life-changing diagnosis

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Writer
It was halftime of Michigan's
2002 football season opener
against Washington, and walk-on
kicker Philip Brabbs stood at the
north endzone, peering anxiously
at the towering goalposts.
He'd hit two field goals from
more than 60 yards out before the
game began, but now, he fired off
kick after kick, missing some into
the Michigan student section - a
section that showered him with
boos after each individual miss.
It was his first game in a Michi-
gan jersey, and Brabbs was blow-
ing it.
The first mistake came earlier.
With nine minutes remaining in
the first quarter, he lined up for
his first collegiate field goal try
from the right hashmarks - 36
yards out.
Wide left.
And as the first half winded
down, Brabbs lined up anoth-
er from 42 yards. The ball was
marked at the left hashmark
- an ideal placement for any
right-footed kicker - but the ball
wobbled out of the holder's hands
and through the air like a knuck-
leball, wide left and under the
goalposts.
Former Michigan coach Lloyd
Carr did what he had to do with
a player who cost the Wolverines
six points. He sent Brabbs to the
bench.
With just over a minute remain-
ing in the fourth quarter and the
Wolverines trailing the Huskies,
29-28, Troy Nienburg, Brabbs'
backup, had a chance to secure
the win from 27 yards with a field
goal of his own. He missed and
the Wolverines had seemingly
run out of chances.
But after a controversial fum-
ble call and a 12-men-on-the-field
penalty, Brabbs was given one
final chance.
He walked onto the field with
five seconds remaining and the
weight of 110,000 fans on his
shoulders. His walk from the
sideline was a peaceful one.
"I kind of felt like things were
scripted atthat point," said Brabbs
seven years after the moment. "I
missed two field goals, one real-
ly badly, and you'd think all the
pressure in the world would be on
top of me, and I feel fine. I didn't
know what the purpose of that
game would be in my life ... but
I knew things were going to fall
into place."
As time expired, the kick sailed
seamlessly through the uprights
and a deafening roar filled
Michigan Stadium. ESPN play-
by-play announcer Brad Nessler
called Brabbs "a cult hero in Ann
Arbor."
"The third time is indeed the
charm," Nessler announced.
It was Brabbs' five seconds of
fame, every kicker's dream come
true.
"He did something today that
will never be forgotten," Carr told
the Daily after the game.
Since then, Brabbs, now 29,
rarely speaks about his miracu-
lous kick. His wife, Cassie, says
that only when prompted does he
discuss those final seconds.
But the peace that Brabbs felt
walking to his triumphant field
goal, "a peace beyond understand-
ing" as he described it, has stuck
with him six years later - when
he needed it most.

Former Michigan kicker Philip Brabbs missed t wo field goals in the first half against Washington in 2002. But this kick sailed through the uprights as time e xpired to give the Wolverines a 31-29 victory.

A BIGGER BURDEN
Brabbs was visiting his family in
2006 when the first signs started to
show.
Several nights in a row, he woke
up dripping in a cold sweat and
complaining of sharp pains in his
chest. Doctors at St. Joseph's Hos-
pital diagnosed Brabbs with a pul-
monary embolism, a blockage of the
main artery of the lung, and doctors
put him on a blood thinner.
After moving back to Ann Arbor
from his home in North Carolina
and having stopped his treatment
on blood thinners, Brabbs' health
issues continued with a blood clot,
first'in his right leg and then in his
left.
"I'm thinking, 'I'm in the hest
shape of my life, why am I having
all of these health issues?'"he said.
Results revealed that his total
protein level was elevated, so
Brabbs and his family went to Little
Rock, Ark. for a gamut of tests to
hopefully resolve his recent influx
of healthissues.
But months of examinations
and reassurance from doctors that
he shouldn't be concerned were
proved wrong - his diagnosis was
more serious than anyone had
anticipated.
Brabbs was diagnosed with
multiple myeloma, a cancer of the
white blood cells, which is almost
unheard of in adults his age. And
since the disease affects the blood
and not a specific part of the body,
Brabbs would have to deal with the
illness for the rest of his life.
"I made the mistake of doing
internet searches ... and everything
I found said that Phil only had five

years to live," Cassie said. "When I
saw that, I felt like everything just
ended right there. All of our plans
and dreams were just gone.
A feav days following the diagno-
sis, friends from the Brabbs' church
offered to watch their two kids,
Ocean and Iris, and allow the cou-
ple to have some time alone togeth-
er. The two didn't have much to
say to each other, but after awhile,

this is an opportunity to focus on
what's important in life."
COMING OUT OF THE
WOODWORK
For Shawn Lazarus, Brabbs'
story hit home.
Six months before Lazarus heard
of Brabbs' diagnosis, his father was
also told he had multiple myelo-

"I'm just thinking, here's
my son, and depending on
where this thing progresses
and where it ends, he might
never really remember me:.
- Philip Brabbs

only on the football field but also in
his battle against cancer.
"For Phil, you don't come back
from missing two kicks and make
the third without any confidence,"
Lazarus said. "He's going back to
where his mind and heart need to
be to find the resolve now that he
found to kick that field goal that
won that game."
Lazarus wasn't the only former
Wolverine that tried to contact
Brabbs, either.
After starting his own blog enti-
tled "Multiple Myeloma for Dum-
mies" to keep his family updated on
his status, Brabbs was contacted by
at least 30 or 40 former teammates
that found the site and emailed,
called or sent along messages to
show their support.
For Birahhs, the support hrings
him back to that game-winning field
goal.
"All of those people were there
in that one moment," Brabbs said.
"And now they're back now to lift
me up, to encourage me to take on
the treatment, take on the disease."
FINDING PEACE - AGAIN
The overwhelming support
Brabbs has received following the
diagnosis is no surprise to those
around him.
"He's just one of those guys on
the team that everyone loved," said
Jim Richardson, Brabbs' father-in-
law. "I swear, he is one of the most
positive and upbeat people on the
planet."
Another moment from Brabbs'
football career stands out to Rich-
ardson as an example of the admira-
tion and respect he had among his
teammates.

On kickoff duty in 2002 against
Illinois, the Illini returner darted
down the field before fumbling
Brabbs' kickoff, leaving the ball
directly in front of the junior kicker.
Without hesitation, Brabbs picked
up the fumble and ran toward the
opposite endzone, only to be tackled
just before the goal line.
Richardson remembers the mob
of winged helmets that surround-
ed Brabbs. It didn't matter to his
teammates that he hadn't scored.
To them, their kicker, with just
three field goals in his collegiate
career, was a positive inspiration.
Brabbs will start a clinical trial
of chemotherapy next month in
hopes thathe will be able to under-
go a stemecell transplant soon after.
Despite the inevitahle hardships
of the oncoming an"ths, Brahhs
remains calm.
When his field goal soared
through the uprights against
Washington, Brabbs had no idea
what purpose it would serve in his
life.
In the same light, Brabbs
acknowledges that he has little
idea what the meaning is behind
his diagnosis, but his family and
his faith is being strengthened
because of it.
"The same thing is going on
through my head as it was during
(the field goal)," Brabbs said. "I
should be feeling all this pressure,
I should have all these doubts and
questions and insecurities sur-
rounding my disease that I'm fac-
ing, but I have complete peace. I
can't explain it, but I feel like this
is what has been dealt.
"I think there's a purpose behind
it and I don't know what that is, but I
hope it's agame-winning field goal."

conversation inexplicably turned to
one of Brabbs' favorite childhood
movies, "The Lion King".
"I envisioned Simba losing his
father, and that's when I broke
down," Brabbs said. "My son at that
point was two-and-a-half, so I'm
just thinking, here's my son, and
depending on where this thing pro-
gresses and where it ends, he might
never really remember me. That's
when I felt like I was stabbed in the
heart.
"Since that moment, I feel like

ma. So when Lazarus found out
that Brabbs had the same illness,
he immediately called his former
teammate despite having only talk-
ed to him once or twice since his
final season in Ann Arbor.
Lazarus,'a defensive lineman on
the 2002 team, couldn't help but
compare his teammate's courage
with that of the biblical story, David
and Goliath.
To Lazarus, Brabbs' faith and
ability to seebeyond himself is what
has separated him as a person, not

Israeli diplomat talks peace process

Deputy consul
general says Iran's
influence hinders
Israeli peace process
By ALEX KIRSHENBAUM
For the Daily
On campus last night, Israeli
Deputy Consul General Gershon
Kedar said Iran's influence in the
Middle East could be a hindrance
to any developments in the Israeli-
Palestinian peace process.
At a lecture, "Exploring the
Dynamic U.S.-Israeli Relation-
ship," Kedar spoke to about 60
attendees on a variety of topics
relating to the Middle East includ-
ing the extremism of Arab-Israeli
conflict to the possibility of a two-
state solution to the conflict.
r Kedar mainly focused his dis-
cussion on Israel's more immedi-
ate neighbors, largely avoiding the
United States' role of in the peace
negotiations.
Discussing the effect of Iran's
geopolitical position on Israeli
peace negotiations, Kedar said that
for the other countries involved,
"Iran is the problem, not Israel."
Kedar spoke frequently about
the negative effects of Iran's influ-
ence in the region on the Middle
East peace process.
"Iran's nuclear umbrella will ...
make (Arab countries') regimes
that much more unstable," he said.
Kedar lectured for only a few
minutes, with most of the event's

midnight. But the governor's office
was waiting on a possible resolu-
tion from the legislature to keep
government running before state
offices were to open Thursday.
Michigan already is struggling
with the nation's highest unem-
ployment rate, a shrinking auto
industry, a high home foreclosure
rate and an economy that soured
long before the national recession.
The number of people receiving
food stamps and unemployment
checks keeps going up, and it's the
only state where the Census Bureau
found increasing poverty rates two
years in a row.
Pennsylvania is now the only in
the country where a budget deal
has not been enacted. Leaders there

Michigan is having a tough
time finding money for everything
from prisons to universities and
in-school health clinics for adoles-
cents. State revenues have grown
just 1.3 percent annually during the
past decade when federal funds are
left out, according to the nonparti-
san House Fiscal Agency.
University funding has dropped

The lack of a budget deal left
51,000 state workers unsure as they
headed to bed Wednesday night
whether they'd work Thursday.
The administration had issuedtem-
porary layoff notices earlier in the
day and told state contractors they
might not get paid.
Granholm had angled to get an
interim budget sent to her by the
Wednesday midnight deadline. It
would have meant 30 more days
for lawmakers to put a more pal-
atable deal in place and she prob-
ably wouldn't have had to cut much
spending during that period.
The interim. budget originally
was Senate Republicans' idea. But
as House Democrats on Wednesday
tried to restore programs, GOP law-
makers feared Democrats only want-
ed to win more time for tax increases.
Meanwhile, school andlocalgov-
ernment leaders grew increasingly
nervous contemplating cuts.
Revenue for cities, villages and
townships has dropped by nearly a
quarter in the past eight years, and
mayors statewide said a proposed
11 percent cut in the new budget
would force them to lay off police,
close parks and shut off some city
services.
Michigan also isin danger of los-
ing millions of federal dollars for
Medicaid and similar programs if
it can't come up with its share of
matching funds.

by using ultra-small polymer par-
ticles to "release morphine and an
antidote automatically in response
to physiological clues," Baker wrote
in an e-mail interview.
"The drug gives long-term relief
from pain for wounded soldiers
while preventing overdoses with
pain medication that might kill
them," Baker wrote.
Baker and his team are work-
ing on the drug through a grant
of about $1.3 million administered
by the U.S. Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.
.aohua Huang, a researcher
on the team and an internal medi-
cine research investigator for the
Michigan Nanotechnology Insti-

tute, explained the team's pur-
pose.
"Wehave todesignthecruciallink
or system that willtrigger the release
of a therapeutic drug and under a
specific condition," Huangsaid.
The researchers tested many
different compounds in hopes of
finding an effective pro-drug, a
modified therapeutic drug thatcan
beconvertedtoanotherdrugunder
a specific condition, according to a
press release from the University
of Michigan Health System.
The team wanted to use a pro-
drug that could become Naloxone,
a drug used toRevent morphine's
negative side effects.
Huang said the Naloxone com-
pound will only activate when
blood oxygen levels become too
low.
"Our drug design will release

an anti-morphine drug that will
reduce the morphine effects, but
the drug will only release when
there's a problem," Huang said.
"The problem becomes a trigger of
release of the anti-morphine drug.
When the problem disappears,that
means the oxygen in the blood has
come back to a normal level."
If the drug proves effective
for humans, it will be a crucial
advancement in the medical world
and especially on the battlefield,
where it will allow for easier
administering of pain relief to
wounded soldiers.
"Sometimes (a soldier) will be in
a remote place that makes it hard
to retreat to a hospital," Huang
said. "Soldiers can give themselves
this pro-drug with morphine with-
out causing any problems."
Besides helping soldiers and

becoming a source of pain control
among other patients, it could also
prevent morphine addiction.
"(The drug) may help pain
control in many medical settings
while preventing overdoses and
potentially avoiding addiction,"
Baker wrote.
The research team is still con-
ducting studies and will soon be
performing animal and toxico-
logical tests. It is not yet known
when the drug will be available for
humans.
"As for the timeline (for
humans), it's hard to say, maybe in
five years," Huang said. "To move
from a clinical trial to a real patient
is still a long way to go."

AIN'T IT COOL NEWS

JAKE FROMM/Daily
Buju Banton concerts have been cancelled at various venues across the country, including in Detroit, for anti-gay lyrics,

PROTEST
From Page 1A
buyer, who booked Banton said the
performer said in the three times
 he has worked Banton's shows, he
has never seen him play the song.
"He's very sensitive to this
topic," he said. "Not only does he
not ever perform any of his work
from when he was kid, he doesn't
even allow the DJs who spin before
or after his sets to play anything
that would resemble homophobic
material."
Berry said that he personally
came outside during the protest
and had a very "civil dialogue"
with the protestors. He added that
he planned on opening the doors
to the club when Banton discussed
the controversial song.
"I went out there and talked to
them myself," he said. "The mayor
came down and he brought the
leaders of the group in and we sat
there and chatted, and I was just
kind of filling the mayor in on what
Buju was all about and why the Pig
is doing this."
Armstrong, however, said that
he does not believe that Banton's
prejudices are in the past and said
he has been recorded singing his
controversial song "Boom Bye-
Bye" in the past couple of years.
"He was recorded saying 'the
war between me and faggots will
never end,"' Armstrong said. "It's

hard to believe he's turned a new
leaf."
Phil Volk, Michigan Democratic
Party LGBT Caucus member an
attendee at the rally, said the pro-
testers are serving an important
purpose.
"Any place where they allow
degrading LGBT people have to
know it's wrong and they have tosee
(this protest) to know it's wrong,"
Volk said. "People are feeding hate
by attending this concert."
But not all LGBT activists sup-
ported the protest.
Bill Dobbs, who is a well-
respected and nationally renowned
gay activist and University alum,
said the LGBT community should
not be protesting Banton's right to
free expression by calling for the
show's cancellation. But, rather,
they should be protesting the mes-
sage of his songs, Dobbs said.
"The dangerous part of this pro-
test is when it's not just to confront
his lyrics but to shut him down,"
Dobbs said. "It's fine to protest,
but it's not fine to work to pull the
plug."
Dobbs added that the tim-
ing of the protest is a bit ironic as
this week is Banned Books Week,
which aims to bring awareness to
the dangers of censorship.
Dobbs likened the push to pre-
vent Banton from performing at
the Blind Pig to the censorship
attempted against certain video
games and eroticabecause they are

believed to cause violence.
He said he believes free speech,
hateful or not, should never be
compromised.
"I'm not defending Banton's
lyrics," Dobbs said. "What I'm
alarmed at is a tactic ... the gay and
lesbian folks who are out there on
the street are doing to somebody
else exactly what's been done to
them and that always comes back
to haunt."
Lawrence Steirhoff, a second-
year University Law student and
political action chair of the Out-
Laws group, an LGBT organization
in the Law School, said the claim
that the protest is an attempt to
stifle Banton's First Amendment
rights is "idiotic."
He said he believes that the com-
munity should be able cancel the
show because, though Banton has
the right to say what he wants, the
protestors are within their rights
to attempt to prevent him from
performing in their community.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje,
who was at last night's protest, said
he was in communication with
representatives from the Blind Pig
to try and urge them to cancel the
show, but ultimately his requests
were denied.
"I'll certainly respect their right
to put the show on," Hieftje said.
"But we're out here to protest."

'M' duo reacts to MSU rivalry

Michigan pegged as early CCHA favorite

By COURTNEY RATKOWIAK
Daily Sports Editor
it seems like they can't help it.
Over the past few years, the week
before the Michigan game, Michi-
gan State coach Mark Dantonio or
his players try their best to give the
Wolverines posterboard material.
This week, it was Spartan senior
defensive end Trevor Anderson who
provided the entertainment.
"(Dantonio) told us that if you
haven't played Michigan, within 30
seconds, you'll realize why we don't
like them. After about 15 seconds,
I realized why I don't like them,"
Andersonsaid attheSpartans' week-
ly press conference in East Lansing.
"I mean, just the total lack of respect
they have for our school in general,
not just our program, but in general,
the lack of respect they have for us.
"As an athlete, you go out there
- we're always taught as Spartans,
you know, to respect our opponent,
and just the lack ofrespecttheyhave,
period, is sickening."
But the 4-0 Wolverines haven't
bothered to publicly respond to
Anderson's comments. After all, as
Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez said
at his press conference yesterday, the
team is too busy concentrating on its
own playto worry about what the 1-3
Spartans are saying off the field.
For their part, redshirt junior line-
backer Obi Ezeh and junior corner-
backDonovan Warrenhaveremained
focused this week on improving this
year's young defense before facing
Michigan State. Both players made
immediate impacts on defense after
they arrived in Ann Arbor. Warren,
coming in as a five-star recruit in
2007, was a Freshman All-American.
And Ezeh, despite the Wolverines'
3-9 record last year, managed to gar-
ner All-Big Ten honorable mention
as a redshirt sophomore.
Now, as two veterans on a team
that consists of almost 70 percent
underclassmen, they are partly
responsible for conveying the impor-
tance of the Michigan/Michigan
State rivalry to their teammates.
Of the two, Warren had the most
to learn about the rivalry's history.
The Long Beach, Calif., native, who
grew up watching UCLA/Southern
Cal battles, said his main exposure

CLIF REEDER/Daiy
Donovan Warren and Obi Ezeh understand the Michigan State side of the rivalry.

to Michigan/Michigan State games
before coming to Ann Arbor was
when he would wake up to watch
the games on television at 9 a.m. on
the West Coast. Back then, he had no
particular rooting interestin mind.
ButEzeh,from Grand Rapids, said
his hometown is split almost evenly
between Michigan and Michigan
State fans. Despite his football alle-
giance, he estimates about five of his
close neighbors fly Spartan flags in
front oftheirhouses.
"When Iget back from a two-hour
drive back, that's the first thing I see,
right by my house, is a Michigan State
flag flying proudly, obviously, because
they won last year," Ezeh said. "Mid-
dle of the night, (I should) go and take
them down or something."
Growing up surrounded by both
sides of the rivalry meantEzeh wasn't
particularly conscious of what he
wore to a Michigan football camp
when he was about 16 years old. After
afternoon drills and 7-on-7 play in the
evening, Ezeh met former Michigan
coach Lloyd Carr for the first time.
They shook hands, and Ezeh
noticed Carr staring athis shirt. Ezeh
glanced down to see what his future
coach was looking at. That's when
the high schooler remembered he
was wearing a cutoff Michigan State
Engineering shirt turned inside out.
"Ifyoucouldseehiseyes,therewas
alot being spoken non-verbally," Ezeh
recalled almost five years later.
Warren's most vivid Michigan
State off-the-field memory was in the
airport last January, en route to his
California home, after he had already
played the Spartans twice in college.
"I had nothing Michigan on, but

a guy just came up to me and said,
'We're gonna beat your ass this year,
again,' " Warren recalled. "I said,
'What?' He was like, 'Yeah, those
Wolverines, we're going to give it to
you this year again.' I said, 'All right,
all right, sir.'"
The cornerback said even though
the mystery man wasn't wearing
Michigan State attire, it was clear
he wasn't from Ohio State or Notre
Dame. After all, he said, with com-
ments like those in a Michigan
airport, the man was bound to be
someone who liked the Spartans.
The Wolverine defense is probably
right to resist responding to Spartan
trash talk as it prepares for Saturday.
Warren and the secondary will be up
against the best passing attack in the
Big Ten. The Spartans are averaging
320.8 yards in the air.
Pass coverage proved to be a
weakness for the Wolverines against
Notre Dame and Indiana, but War-
ren is coming into the game fresh off
of a clutch game-ending interception
against the Hoosiers last Saturday.
Sophomore Boubacar Cissoko and
redshirt freshman J.T. Floyd are still
fighting for the other cornerback
spot, according to Rodriguez, and
the play of the secondary could very
well determine Saturday's game.
Until then, Michigan is focusing
on the field, not the soapbox.
"I can't control what they say, and
neither can our players," Rodriguez
said. "I don't think any of our players
have said anything disrespectful....
We always concentrate more on our-
selves and what we do and how we go
about our business. Not sonmuch what
anybody else does in their program."

and if we have a good goalie, we

RE-DOING THE RULES: The
CCHA has changed how points
are awarded for shootoutvictories
and losses. Under the new rules, if
a team beats its opponentin either
regulation or overtime - before
the game reaches a shootout -
it will earn three points. Teams
will earn just two points with a
shootout win, one with a shootout
loss and zero with a regulation or
overtime loss.
Previously, teams were award-
ed two points for a regulation or
overtime win and zero points for
a regulation or overtime loss. If
the teams went to a shootout, the
winner would gain three points,
more than they would earn for a
regulation win.
Under the new rules, there is
more of an incentive to finish a
game in regulation or overtime
instead of letting the contest go to
a shootout.
Both Berenson and CCHA
Commissioner Tom Anastos
agreed thatthe revision will make
it a more fair system.

PONTIAC - It turned out 31
shots weren't enough. The Michi-
gan men's soccer team needed a
lucky bounce - and that's the only

and aggressive, physical play, the
Wolverines couldn't find the back
of the net in yesterday's 0-0 double

the indoor stadium at Ultimate Soc-

The Wolverines had countless
scoring chances, with shots flying
just right and left ofthe sidebars and
barely clearing the crossbar. Michi-
gan's 31 shots forced Oakland'sgoal-

"We just couldn't put the ball

to just five during the opening seg-
ment. The Wolverines' goal-scoring
percentage jumps almost from 6.5
percent inthe firsthalf to 18 percent
in the second half, sincetheir condi-
tioning kicks and superior physical
condition outlasts other teams.
but after 110 minutes of play last
night, there was plenty of time for
the Wolverines to tire. The sudden
death overtime provided even more
motivation to put away one of their
in-state rivals.

on said. "I just thought, 'We need to

Even with the goose egg on the
scoreboard, Michigan showed signs
of improvement each period. The
offense had more and more shots as
the game went on and the Michigan
defense allowed fewer and fewer
Grizzly shots.
Oakland focused on defense,
using up to six players at times to
defend the dynamic Wolverine
offensive tandem of senior Mauro
Fuzetti and junior Justin Meram.
The duo combined for nine of Mich-
igan's 31shots.
Duringthe first half, the Wolver-
ines lofted ball after ball to the inside
of the box, but they were unable to

penetrate the Grizzly backline and
the presence of 6-foot-4 Serbian
native Vuk Popovic.

was redshirt senior captain Danny

The Badgers eked out a 1-0 win
over the Grizzlies on Sept. 18 in a
close-fought match that showcased
play that was similar to yesterday's

the job done on the scoreboard.

n the basement of the newy remodeled Uni-
versity of Michigan Museum of Art, a sizable
crowd has gathered in a sleek, sterile-looking
auditoriufm. It's a Friday night in Ann Arbor,
and you can almost hear the sound of cheap
beers cracking open throughodt the city. But
for those sitting in UMMA's Helmut Stern Auditorium,
the only sound that echoes is the voice of Kyle Booten,"
who is center-stage, reciting his ambitious, abstract
brand of poetry. Booten - along with a large percent-
age of his audience - is a student in the University's,
MFA program. The atmosphere is warm and'congenial,
and the sense of community amo-g tfiose assemblid is
akin to that pf a congenial family.reunion. As the night
wears on, it becomes clear that the University's MFA
students are unlike most other graduate students.
Short for Master of Fine Arts, an MFA program is an
often overlooked and misunderstood two-year gradu-
ate program in which students prepare for careers
writing poetry, fiction or both. The MFA program.was
first introduced at the University of Iowa 70 years ago.
Now MFA degrees are offered at more than 150 uni-''
versities across the nation. Despite, the success of the
MFA movement, it's been surrounded by a fair degree ,
of controversy. Most of the flak'arises from the very }
nature of an lM7FA program. In essence, it attempts to
p teach something historically considered unteachable: .O
creative writing. qJ For more pragmatic types, .it may
be hard to fatholi how c" why such programs Rifst.
Unlike in law or medical school, there is no standard-
ized set of information students must master before
graduating from an MFA program. The idea of teach-
ing something as slippery and subjective as creative
writing seems to some an impossible or even absurd
undertaking. qi Quotes abound by writers and profes-
sors who decry the utility of MFA programs. The New
Yorker's Louis Menand complains that "Creative-writ-
ing programs are designed on the theory that students,
who have never published a poem can teach other stu-
* dents who have never published a poem how to write a
publishable poem." The idea is reductive, yes, but not
so far off. The crux of any MFA program is the writ-
ing workshop, in which students - most of whom have'
never been published - read and critique each other's
work in a small, generally supportive classroom setting.
This is, so to speak, how the magic happens.

TRAILER REVIEW
FISH TANK
IFC
"Fish Tank" conjures up images of Catherine Hardwicke's "Thirteen," as a young
teenage girl (newconier Katie Jarvis) struggles to find her place in her metaphori-
cal fish tank, trapped by adult conventions and teenage temptations. The trailer is
big on the anger she feels, and it proves to be a viable showcase for Jarvis's shouting
skills. Asthis year's Cannes Jury Prize Winner, "Fish Tank" is sure to generate some
critical buzz, but the trailer doesn't show anything out ofthe ordinary. Still, coming-
of-age stories never get old, and this should be a strong one.

My Indian hideaway

"Got any food in there?"

Mad over Moore

Michael Moore explains why
Capitalism: A Love Story'
has come just in time.
By Kavi Pandey I Daily Arts Writer
Across the street from General Motors Corp.'s palatial head-
quarters where the Detroit premiere of his new film "Capital-
ism: A Love Story" was takingplace, Michael Moore was doing
press interviews in a decidedly less-glitzy hotel ballroom.
"We're not supposed to be here," Moore says. "We were
going to be over there, sitting in the lobby while people were
watching the movie. And GM said no, I can't be there if I've
got any of you (reporters) around."
Moore has had a nearly two-decade-long feud with GM,
beginning with his 1989 landmark documentary "Roger &
Me," which chronicled his quest to interview GM chairman
Roger B. Smith - the man whose decision to shut down sev-
eral plants devastated the economy of Flint, Moore's home-
town.
"They should kind of get over it, whatever the problem is
with me," Moore said. "I'm not walking around saying 'I told
you so,' and they should be gracious about it."
Here, he is referring to the prophetic nature of "Roger &
Me," which exposed the outsourcing and foolish corporate
decisions that crumbled the once-invincible automobile
industry in Michigan.
Even still, Moore isn't proud he was one of the first people
to call out GM on its poor economic practices.
"I try to think about what I did wrong. I set out with
that film to change things, to wake people up about General
Motors," he said. "I had this fantasy that somehow people
would go see this movie, everyone would wise up to this com-
pany and it wouldn't end up the way it has now. The fact that
it has failed, that it has thrown even more people out of work,
it makes me question, could I have done something? Could I
have said something else, in a different way?"
Moore's films have a tendency to be ahead of their time.
Aside from "Roger & Me," released almost 20 years before
GM's bankruptcy, he also admits that his previous film "Sicko"
was released two years too early - the health care debate in
America wasn't fully amplified until this summer.
But with "Capitalism," Moore thinks he has nailed current
public sentiment.
"This film is going to come out and perhaps be the most rel-
evant film (audiences) have seen this year," he said. "And they
will see things in this movie they will not see on the evening
news."
The film revolves around last fall's economic crisis, tracing
its origins from the deregulation during the Reagan adminis-
tration to the multi-billion dollar bailouts doled out in the past
year. Moore gives a comprehensive-yet-simplified explanation
of what went wrong, leading to an all-out attack on the ideals of
capitalism and the troubles it has created in our country.

"I don't define capitalism as working hard, making money,
doing well, being inventive," he said. "Capitalism now has
become about money - making money off money, moving
money around, investing money in money, taking bets on
money, derivatives on money, turning Wall Street into a casi-
no and guaranteeing the richest 1 percent get the biggest hunk
of the pie."
"Nobody is talking about dividing the pie equally, that
we're all goingto be paid the exact same amount - just divide
it fairly," he added.
Despite its heavy-handed ideas, Moore is optimistic that
"Capitalism" will connect with audiences.
"People are run down and full of despair right now," he
said. "But this is a movie for them to go to and have a cathartic
experience, watching the bad guy get his comeuppance."
The studio certainly expects people to come in droves.
Fresh off critical praise from its world premiere at the Ven-
ice Film Festival, "Capitalism" will be released to more than
1,000 screens on Oct. 2 - Moore's biggest opening to date.
Michael Moore is one of the few filmmakers who can con-
struct a mass-appeal film about political issues, but for "Capi-
talism," the process was far from a breeze.
"Who wants to go to a movie about an economic theory?
That was the challenge," Moore explained. "Now how do I
make this really interesting, fun, exciting, damning, danger-
ous movie that people would want to see on a Friday night?
And by the way, let's put the word 'capitalism' in the title."
"If you think about taking your date out on a Friday night,
'Let's go see that 'Capitalism' movie' - not exactly what's
going to get you what you want at the end of the night."
Times have certainly changed for Michael Moore. The
last time he filmed without a permit on Wall Street for
Rage Against the Machine's "Sleep Now in the Fire" music
video, he was taken away by the police.
Moore's Wall Street prank in "Capitalism"
is certainly less bombastic - he wraps
crime scene tape around culpable bank-
ing institutions - but he was neverthe-
less surprised by the reaction from the
authorities.
"The cop says to me, 'Mike, the guys
inside this building lost a billion dollars of
our NYC police pension fund. You take all
the time you want.' So wow, the police are
on my side now."
The fuzz isn't the only unforeseen group
joining his crusade - Moore mentions that
in preview screenings, "Capitalism" has
tested better with Republicans and conser-
vatives than any of his prior documenta-
ries. And he knows why.
"When you have one foreclosure every
seven and a half seconds in this country,
that doesn't know any party lines. Or class
lines. Or racial lines. Everybody is getting
smeared."

Bob Marley-themed Indian buffet,
this is an ode to you. Every Tues-
day and Thursday, without fail, I
stagger up your Astroturf-covered steps,
clutching my stomach,
famished. The combina-
tion of vegetarian Punja- Y
bi cuisine and bumping
reggae music may seem
an incongruent duo, but
when you are hungry -
and cheap, as I most LILA
often am, it makes per- K
feet sense. Earthen Jar,
a local Mecca for vegetarians, is a hidden
treasure - one of a handful of great little
spots that collectively contribute to Ann
Arbor's quirky cool. I am not the first to
have heralded its awesomeness, but still,
this place deserves another round of
applause. It is a too well kept a secret in a
town this size.
First semester freshman year, I count-
ed myself among the most carnivorous of
campus dwellers. I probed the mystery
meat of East Quad's cafeteria, scarfed
sloppy joes with the best of the athletes in
South Quad and munched on lunchmeat
in Mary Markley. After 18 years of solid
omnivorousness, my body decided it had
had enough and I made a drastic jump to
veganism in February 2008.
At first, I wasn't sure I could be satis-
fied with purely vegan food. I had eaten
meat at almost every meal for as long as
I could remember, and I had tried tofu
maybe twice. I was also skeptical of the
appetite-abating power of the "vegetarian
option." After much research and taste
testing, I have learned that there is noth-
ing more pleasing than a belly full of inex-
pensive vegan Indian food - a satisfaction
guaranteed at Earthen Jar.
Located on South Fifth Avenue, Earthen
Jar neighbors Jerusalem Garden, another
delicious option for vegetarians and meat-
eaters alike. Inside, Earthen Jar's walls
are each painted a different cheery shade:
orange, lime-green or yellow, playing up
the Trenchtown, Jamaica vibe. There's
ivy growing up the wall around the res-
taurant's window, which is a nonsensical
touch as whimsical as the inspirational
words you will find printed on the sheets
of paper tucked under the plastic table-
cloth protectors. The buffet is run by a
father and son who both constantly have
pleasant expressions on their faces. One or
the other mans the register depending on
the day and, really, to re-emphasize, I've
never seen these guys not sportingsmiles.
It's infectious.

The best part: Once you've picked out
your selections and paid at the front, the
people-watching at Earthen Jar is fabu-
lous. There's usually a solid mix of stu-
dents, hippies, old people and Rastafarian
blonde guys (the best of ironic treats) to
look at in the restaurant. Around tradi-
tional meal times the Jar can get crowded,
but still it's definitely a prime date spot for
a Friday or Saturday evening, you know,
after you've blown all that cash down
on Main Street and are ready to let your
significant other in on your real financial
situation.
No woman? No cry! There are takeout
containers and tables for one. If it's a
nice day outside, you might choose to sit
on one of the benches lining the walk-
way. If.you decide to stay, there's a water
cooler in the corner with steel cups that
keep their contents super cold; these
are always welcome after some kicking
Indian spice. Down to slurp on something

Earthen Jar.
more adventurous? Try Earthen Jar's
lassi, a traditional dairy-based drink that
also comes in a soy version for all you
vegans out there. The taste really helps
counter the spiciness of the food if you're
having trouble taking the heat.
Though the menu is constant, there are
tons of options ranging from traditional
Indian dishes like chana masala and alu
gobi to less exploratory ones like maca-
roni and cheese and lasagna. The Earthen
Jar's dessert game is strong, offering an
assortment of cookies, brownies and can-
dies. Laddoo, a sweet lentil ball akin to a
doughnut hole, is a perfect finale. They're
only 95 cents each and one is more than
enough, though they're so good you might
want two.
Recently I stopped eating vegan, but
Earthen Jar still keeps me coming back.
I've eaten at my fair share of Indian res-
taurants, but so far, nothing compares
to tenaciously shoveling naan into your
mouth with Bob winking at you coyly
from above.

w 'DAISIES' (1966)
A surreal bouquet
of 'Daisies'

Rocca s modern life

By JACK PORTER
Daily Arts Writer
Vera Chytilov's "Sedmikrasky"
("Daisies") is a divisive film.
According to Czech film historian
Peter Hames, female audiences
saw humor in "Daisies" where men
did not. Women also more closely
identified with its heroines, while
men were more likely to see them
as petulant brats. Audiences may
be less prejudiced now, but femi-
nism is still a contentious topic.
Either way, "Daisies" is a delicious
conversation starter.
"Daisies" is often lumped into
the dubious category of the "Czech
New Wave," a period during the
'60s which saw the emergence of
talents like Milos Forman and Jan
Nemec. These directors drew from
practices like surrealism, cinema
verite and neo-realism. But even
compared to its contemporaries,
"Daisies" is totally iconoclastic; it's
a feminist critique wrapped in a
beautiful psychedelic package.
The film has something like a
story, but it's more a series of the-
matically connected skits than a
logical narrative piece. In sum-
mary, the two protagonists, Marie
I and Marie II (a.k.a "the blonde"
and "the brunette," among other
names) are two mischievous teen-
age girls who generally wreak
havoc, scamming old men out of
their riches on lavish dinner dates,
upstaging cabaret performances
and even setting fires. While dis-
rupting social order, they also
engage in nonsensical dialogue on
the meaning of life.
In the same way that the events
in "Daisies" are illustrative and
allegorical, its characters are like
puppets that exist to both enact
and deconstruct traditional ideas
about women. To heighten this
impression of unreality, the direc-
tor instructed the actresses (who
were models by trade) to speak
every line in a silly, coquettish way.
This parody of feminine arche-
types further calls attention to the
film's playful, rebellious spirit.
Though its subtext is heady, the
film is a blast to watch. Despite the
actors' lack of experience, their
physical comedy is spot-on. To
match the actors' pratfalls, the film

is edited to include deliberate con-
tinuity "errors," givingthe impres-
sion that people and objects can.
magically transform and teleport
from one place to another. In con-
text, these well-timed edits create
jokes in film form and add to the
overall sense of chaos. But those
elements only constitute a small
part of the film's outrageous visual
style.
"Daisies," on the most basic
sensory level, is an explosion of
color. This is partially achieved
by the heroines' costumes and the
film's settings, which constantly
change. Color filters add to the
atmosphere of spontaneity. Tell-
ingly, the heroines' bedroom looks
like an art installation, with scrib-
bled patterns, magazine clippings
An artsy movie
that's both
inventive and
accessible.
of glamorous women and draw-
ings of flowers brought together
in a collage that covers the walls.
The room acts as a microcosm of
the film in its deconstruction of
feminine images. Further, this
deconstructive theme is explored
in striking animation sequences
where collages of leaves, roses and
butterflies seem to dance in front
of the screen. The blazing, shim-
mering, rainbow-tinted journey
through a train tunnel is a visual
high point.
Most art films seem to be only
entertaining to an elite . group
trained in how to "read" them.
Against the odds, "Daisies" offers
enjoyment on multiple levels. It's
frequently funny. It's gorgeous to
watch. It has showy technique for
film buffs and is open to delirious
interpretation games by film schol-
ars. It also gets people talking as
they struggle to identify (or not)
with the blonde and the brunette.
For those looking for a film that is
both non-traditional and non-bor-
ing, look no further.

Mo Rocca's eccentric
journey from TV addict to
media personality
By CAROLYN KLARECKI
Daily TV/New Media Editor
You might not know it, but you know who
Mo Rocca is. The man has one of the most ran-
dom yet impressive resumes the entertainment
business has ever seen. He's a recurring judge
on "Iron Chef: America," a regular contributor
to NPR's "Wait, Wait ... Don't Tell Me!" and a
commentator for VHI's "Best Week Ever" and
"I love the ..." series. He was a correspondent
for "The Tonight Show" and is currently cor-
responding for "CBS News Sunday Morning"
and "The Daily Show." Oh, and he was on
Broadway in "The 25th Annual Putnam Coun-
ty Spelling Bee."
So, yes, you're probably familiar with him in
some capacity or another. It's almost as though
Rocca has the career of a celebrity has-been,
without ever really having been. He's well
aware of this, however, stating early in his lec-
ture at the Ross School of Business on Friday,
"At this point, some of you are probably won-
dering who the hell I am," and a little later, "At
this point, you may be thinking what a lot of
people think, which is 'OK, great, but how the
hell did you get to be on TV?"'
In an exclusive interview with the Daily, he
disclosed how he felt he got his start.
"Well, it all started, I think, when I was very
very little and couldn't stop watching TV. And
the neighbors - I have two brothers, there are
three of us in all - the neighbors thought there
were only two children because I was inside

all the time," Rocca said. "I must've looked
like I had skim milk runningthrough my veins
because I was translucent. I was so pale and
sickly. And so I was just indoors all the time
and if I wasn't watching TV, I was imagining
TV shows that I would be on."
Rocca started performing when his parents
grew concerned about the amount of time he
spent in front of the television.
"And then finally my parents just threw me
out of the house - I mean, just like onto the
front lawn - and I had all this pent-up energy
and at first I used it to pursue a career in gym-
nastics," Rocca explained. "I taught myself
tumbling. Sometimes I would land on my head
and it would hurt. So the gymnastics didn't
get too far ... In any case, I sort of segued from
gymnastics into performing. And I loved doing
plays and musicals, but I wasn't sure if I want-
ed to write or perform in them or both."
When Rocca went to Harvard he got very
involved with Hasty Pudding Theatricals, one
of Harvard's more prominent theater troupes,
for which he wrote and performed in for all
four years of his college career.
"(That) is pretty damn impressive," Rocca
said. "Very few people do that - not the Har-
vard part, I mean the Hasty Pudding part."
Rocca is nothing short of impressive, but
eccentric is the best word to describe him. He
stood out among the B-school faculty wear-
ing a pair of bright pink pants - later clari-
fied on Twitter as "Nantucket Red" - and a
large, funky pair of glasses. He invited audi-
ence members to quiz him on world capitals
throughout his talk and was never wrong.
"South Africa actually has three capitals,"
he exclaimed. "It's Cape Town. It's Pretoria
and it's not Johannesburg, it's Bloemfontein.
Am I right?" More than once, he broke out

into song and he ended his lecture by giving an
impromptu ballet performance.
It's clear that Rocca is comfortable with
himself and truly loves what he does. And he's
done a lot.
But he cites reporting as his favorite job.
"I loved doing television field pieces and
I've done a lot of them," he said. "If you com-
bine 'The Daily Show' with 'The Tonight Show'
with my gig on 'Sunday Morning,' I see them
all as part of one continuum in a way. Three-
to six-minute stories with my point of view
with me acting in some way as a journalist -
certainly as a storyteller - and participating
in one degree or another in the story ... I love
doing that."
Still, it's hard to label him as simply a TV
correspondent. "It's not easy to describe
what I do or give myself a title," he said. "I've
earned the title 'pundit,' but anyone can be a
pundit. So I don't want to be a pundit, and a
fundit - a fun pundit - is a little too cutesy. I
think it's a little too precious ... and 'satirist' is
a little bit lofty ... no one knows what a satirist
is anymore. So I consider myself a commenta-
tor, a correspondent and common. Those are
my three seats."
Though he's very good at what he's doingnow,
Rocca is looking forward to bigger projects.
"Well, I want to do another booksince no one
read the first one, but Iliked writing it," he said
referring to his book "All the Presidents' Pets,"
which, in spite of its didactic title, is satirical
fiction, so you can and should read it.
But whatever projects Mo Rocca embarks on
