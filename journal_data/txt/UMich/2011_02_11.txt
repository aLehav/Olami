Architecture
students to research
housing options
in rural areas
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
For the Daily
Though some University stu-
dents will take classes in Ann
Arbor this spring and summer,
others plan to continue their
studies in the rural countryside

of China.
Sponsored by the Univer-
sity's Graham Environmental
Sustainability Institute, a new
field-based course on sustain-
ability will be launched near
Beijing during the upcom-
ing spring semester. Graduate
students in the University's
Taubman College of Archi-
tecture and Urban Planning
undergraduates of all majors
are being considered for the
program called "Toward a New
Sustainable Environment in
Light of the Changing Face of

Rural (and Urban) China."
Mary Ann Ray, clinical
professor of architecture at
the University, will teach the
course. She said one of the
major goals of the program,
which will run from May 9
through July 10, will be to make
the rural environment of Chi-
na's Pearl River Valley "more
viable for living."
According to Ray, the need
for sustainability projects in
China's rural areas stems from
the country's large population.
One-fifth of the world's popula-

tion lives in China, and about
half of those people live in rural
areas, Ray said.
"The cities are just not able
to take the capacity of human
beings coming into them," Ray
said.
Students taking the course
will attempt to solve problems
associated with rural living,
including a lack of access to
good health care and education
and the absence of the Internet,
Ray said. Jobs, including entre-
preneurship opportunities, are

After skating their way to a
silver medal at the 2010 Winter
Olympics in Vancouver, ice danc-

ing duo Charlie White and Meryl
Davis are back for more.
Since last year's Olympic
games, the pair of University stu-
dents has competed four times -
in Japan, China, Washington and
North Carolina - and won each
contest. Though they are now
back on campus, the team is rig-
orously preparing for more com-
petitions.
White, 23, said he and Davis,

24, are competitive at this level
because they are able to remain
focused on their routines and
what they should improve, rather
than on winning.
"Figure skating obviously
takes natural talent, but it's a big
mental game," he said. "There's
verylittle margin for error."

added that the current political
unrest in Tunisia and Egypt may
potentially spur future govern-
ment overthrows worldwide as
countries strive toward demo-
cratic governments.
"This is not a uniquely Egyp-
tian phenomenon," North said.
"This is a global phenomenon.
What is happening in Egypt is
the beginning of a global revolu-
tionary process."
As Egypt entered into its
18th day of violence yesterday,
rumors circulated that Mubarak
would step down from his post.
Instead, he announced he would
remain in office but reallocate
some of his powers to Egypt Vice
President Omar Suleiman. In
response to the rumors, the mili-
tary mobilized preparing for vio-
lence from the dissenting public.
The events in Egypt paral-
lel certain social and economic
situations in the United States,
North said. He added that it is
essential for college students to
have an understanding of global
revolutions, since this generation

has yet to experience a social
uprising of this magnitude.
"You are growing up in a
world that is going to be shaped
by revolution," he said.
He added that global events
like the revolution in Egypt also
educate many citizens about
countries' political issues in vari-
ous countries.
"The masses learn more about
politics in 24 hours than they
would otherwise learn in half a
century," North said.
LSA and Art & Design sopho-
more Micaela McCabe said she
was drawn to the discussion
because of her studies in interna-
tional development.
"I think it is incredibly impor-
tant for students to know what is
going on in the world," McCabe.
said. "Seeing how other democ-
racies and other governmental
systems work, I think is impor-
tant to know."
LSA freshman Zoe Crowley
said she went to the event to
broaden her knowledge about
the Egyptian conflict.
"(The media) is not necessar-
ily addressing the issues that I

am interested in," Crowley said.
"I came to get a more worldly
perspective on what is happen-
ing in Egypt right now. This sort
of social unrest is all around us,
and people just choose to close
their eyes to it."
LSA freshman Anthony Green
said it is important for students
to have an understanding of
global events like the Egyptian
revolution.
"It is incredible to watch so
many people taking destiny into
their own hands," he said.
Rackham student Nicholas
Niemuth said he viewed the
event as a means for students
to develop an understanding
of social systems and how to
improve them in the future,
especially in the context of world
revolutions.
"I think it is extremely impor-
tant as a starting point, to have a
basis, have someone to point you
in the direction to do the learn-
ingyourself," Niemuth said, "and
to come to understand the actual
social structures that exist and
why they exist ... and the moti-
vations that they have to keep
things the way they are or to try
to change things for the better."

Lawsuit alleges
government failed
to protect state from
immigrant 'invasion'
PHOENIX (AP) - Gov. Jan
Brewer sued the federal gov-
ernment yesterday for failing to
control Arizona's border with
Mexico and enforce immigra-
tion laws, and for sticking the
state with huge costs associated
with jailing illegal immigrants
who commit crimes.
The lawsuit claims the feder-
al government has failed to pro-
tect Arizona from an "invasion"
of illegal immigrants. It seeks
increased reimbursements and
extra safeguards, such as addi-
tional border fences.
Brewer's court filing serves
as a countersuit in the federal
government's legal challenge
to Arizona's new enforcement
immigration law. The U.S. Jus-
tice Department is seeking to
invalidate the law.
"Because the federal govern-
ment has failed to protect the
citizens of Arizona, I am left
with no other choice," Brewer
said as sign-carrying protesters
yelled chants at her and at other
champions of the immigration
law.
Justice Department spokes-

woman 'Tracy Schmaler
declined to comment on the fil-
ing. But a spokesman for the U.S.
Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, which is in charge of polic-
ing the country's borders, called
Brewer's lawsuit a meritless
action and said Border Patrol
staffing is higher than ever.
"Not only do actions like this
ignore all of the statistical evi-
dence, they also belittle the sig-
nificant progress that our men
and women in uniform have
made to protect this border and
the people who live alongside
it," spokesman Matthew Chan-
dler said. "We welcome any
state and local government or
law enforcement agency to join
with us to address the remain-
ing challenges."
Brewer's lawsuit seeks a court
order that would require the
federal governmenttotake extra
steps to protect Arizona - such
as more border fences - until
the border is controlled. Brewer
also asks for additional border
agents and technology along the
state's border with Mexico.
The governor isn't seeking
a lump-sum award, but rather
asks for policy changes in the
way the federal government
reimburses states for the costs
of jailingillegal immigrants who
are convicted of state crimes.
Such changes would give the
state more reimbursement.

Arizona's enforcement law
was passed amid years of com-
plaints that the federal gov-
ernment hasn't done enough
to lessen the state's role as the
nation's busiest illegal entry
point. Its passage ignited pro-
tests over whether the law
would lead to racial profiling,
and prompted lawsuits by the
Justice Department, civil rights
groups and other opponents
seeking to have it thrown out.
The law would have required
police, while, enforcing other
laws, to question a person's
immigration status if officers
had reasonable suspicion the
person was in the country ille-
gally. That requirement was put
on hold by U.S. District Judge
Susan Bolton, along with a man-
date that immigrants obtain or
carry immigration registration
papers.
The judge, however, let other
parts of the law take effect, such
as a provision that bans people
from blocking traffic while
seeking or offering day-labor
services on streets.
Brewer challenged Bolton's
decision in an appeals court in
San Francisco. She argued the
judge erred by accepting specu-
lation bythe federal government
that the law might burden legal
immigrants, and by concluding
the federal government likely
would prevail.

A fight is brewing in Missis-

The Mississippi Division of
Sons of Confederate Veterans

Forrest, a Tennessee native,

Military dog to get

A former Oregon military dog

The Mail Tribune reports the

named Basco was adopted in
November by Debbie Richter in
Medford after he was discharged

Hip problems such as arthritis
can lead to early death for larger
dogs, and surgery options such
as hip replacement have a limited
chance of success for an older dog
like Basco, who is 7.
While researching alterna-

Past Michigan commission ruling
prevents GSRAs from joining GEO

From Page 1
union initially included GSIs,
GSSAs and GSRAs. But after
a couple years, the Univer-
sity challenged the rights of all
graduate employees for union
representation. The case was
then taken to the Michigan
Employment Relations Com-
mission, which ruled that GSIs
and GSSAs are covered by GEO,
but GSRAs are not.
Gillezeau said the exclu-
sion of GSRAs reflects what he
thinks is the University's stance
- that GSRAs are more inter-
ested in their dissertations than
aiding the University. However,
he said the research GSRAs do
allows them to make significant
contributions to the University.
"I think that it's entirely clear
that over the last 30 years since
that decision was handed down,
research is the main goal of the
University today," Gillezeau
said. "As such, it's pretty clear
that GSRAs are important
workers in achieving that goal
for the University."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the University
aims to maintain its adherence
to the 1981 Michigan Employ-
ment Relations Commission
ruling that established member-
ship guidelines for GEO.
"The University continues
to believe in the ruling by the
Michigan Employment Rela-
tions Commission that essen-
tially separated the GSRAs from
the membership in the GEO,"
Fitzgerald said. "The state
ruled that GSIs are primar-
ily students, and we continue to
believe in that ruling."
Gillezeau added that some
GSRAs shouldn't be included
in GEO's collective bargain-
ing plan and that making the
differentiation between which

TODD NEEDL E/Daily
A member of the Graduate Employees Ortanizaios delivers a giant letter to
Usiversity President Mary S Coleman's office yesterday.

GSRAs are included in the unit
is "not necessarily easy."
"We do acknowledge that
there are a handful of GSRAs
who are in fact - especially in
the later years of the Ph.D.s --
doing research for their own
dissertations, and those people
should not be in the bargaining
unit," Gillezeau said.
Though they aren't required
to join, 70 percent of GSIs and
GSSAs at the University are
members of GEO, according to
Gillezeau. GSIs and GSSAs can
join the union and pay dues or
decline to join and only pay ser-
vice fees for bargaining done by
GEO on their behalf, he said.
GSRAs aren't legally cov-
ered by the GEO contract, but
Gillezeau said GEO believes
it represents GSRAs, as their
wages are determined by nego-
tiations between GEO and the
University. Gillezeau said the

research assistants are mainly
fighting to have full union rights
like GSIs and GSSAs do.
Gillezeau added that not
only did Coleman ignore the
research assistants' efforts to
unionize, but University nego-
tiators also refused to engage
with GEO on the topic.
"They said that they would
not discuss permissive topics of
bargaining," he said.
As of 6 p.m. yesterday,
Fitzgerald said he wasn't sure
whether Coleman had read the
letter delivered to her, but it was
forwarded to appropriate Uni-
versity representatives.
"We've certainly received the
letter; it's a position that's been
communicated previously to
the University," Fitzgerald said.
"The president's office has made
the appropriate people in aca-
demic (human resources) aware
of the letter."

The Fulbright Program is part
of the U.S. Department of State's
Bureau of Educational and Cul-
tural Affairs and receives most of
its funding from the federal gov-
ernment. The program has vari-
ous scholarships it gives every
year to applicants ranging from
students to professionals.
Applicants must show proof
of proficiency in a foreign lan-
guage to be eligible for certain
grants. Applicants also apply for
a specific scholarship depend-
ing on the country, and each
scholarship differs slightly in its
award value and duration.
The faculty members at
the University of Michigan
received their awards to con-
duct research abroad in consul-
tation with a university in their
host country.
For Yunker, her research
involves a large amount of inter-
action with Israeli students. She
said this allows her to observe
how Israeli students' lives are
different from those in the Unit-
ed States.
"As part of my research, I've
gotten to travel all over (Israel)
with middle and high school
students participating in educa-
tional field trips through their
geology classes,' Yunker wrote.
"It's truly an exchange of every-
thing - conversation, knowl-
edge, ideas, skills, friendship
and emotions."
DeGenaro is studying at the
American University of Beirut in
Lebanon for one year where he
is evaluating a literacy initiative
that works withstudents toteach

He's also working on a cross-cul-
tural project in English classes

DeGenaro wrote in an e-mail
interview that he is using his
experience to increase his
understanding of the cultural
background of many of his stu-
dents in Dearborn.
"Each term at UM-Dearborn,
I meet students who grew up
in Lebanon, or whose families
live here or who go back to visit
their villages and rave about life
here," DeGenaro wrote. "I'm not
Lebanese, butI think ISnow have
a more informed sense of what
makes those students who they
are - and what makes them love
Lebanon, too."
Like Yunker, Smith also has a
two-year research fellowship at
the Weizmann Institute. Smith
is studying organic chemistry in
Israel and will look at how pep-
tide structural changes affect
biomembranes.
Mir wrote in an e-mail inter-
view that she is using her schol-
arship to research the influence
of "Muslim socio-religious
reform in late colonial India."
She is studying at the Univer-
sity of Delhi in India for nine
months and wrote thatshe hopes
to publish a book about her find-
ings. Living in Delhi is a major
change in atmosphere from
Ann Arbor, Mir explained she is
adapting to and appreciating.
"It's an exciting place, under-
going immense growth and
change," Mir wrote. "It's a privi-
lege to be here to be able to see it
firsthand."
Mir noted the significance of
having four University faculty
members receive a Fulbright
award this year.
"For (the University), I imag-
ine that securing faculty Ful-
bright awards is a sign of faculty
commitment to research," Mit
wrote. "It is also a sign of the
faculty's engagement with the
world at large, a sign of the truly
global nature of our University."
For the 2010-2011 school year,
the University also had the high-
est number of students receiv-
ing Fulbright scholarships than
any other school in the nation.
According to an October 2010
University press release, 43
students were offered scholar-
ships and 39 accepted. It was
the fourth time since 2005 that
theUniversity ranked above any
other institution.
The number of faculty mem-
bers receiving Fulbright Schol-
ar grants has lagged behind
the number of students in past
years. In an Oct. 25, 2010 article
in The Michigan Daily, Univer-
sity Provost Philip Hanlon said
that while he was aware of the
difference, he was unable to give
any reason for it.
"All Ican say is I noted that as

A group of about 12 to 15 stu-
dents will be accepted into the
program and will research and
document the conditions of the
villages where they will work.
The PearlRiverValleycontains
about 27 villages and is about 2.5
hours away from Beijing, accord-
ing to the course syllabus. Stu-

dents are expected to create to a
new model for rural housing by
modernizing living standards,
which includes improving infra-
structure, water purification and
waste management.
Ray - who has prior experi-
ence taking student groups to
Turkey, Mexico and Italy - has
been working with the Graham
Institute since last semester to
plan the course. Though this
is the first year this particular
course is being offered, the Col-

lege of Architecture has been
taking students to China since,
2004.
Architecture graduate stu-
dent Nicholas Ho said he has
worked with Ray in the past
and plans to participate in the
course this spring.
"This new model will change
the world in some way," Ho said.

thing that I can get out of (the
course) is the firsthand experi-

petition in Taiping City, Taiwan,
but Davis said their biggest com-
petition will be the World Figure
Skating Championships at the
end of March.
"We got second last year," she
said. "So we're definitely trying
to be on top of the podium this
year."
In preparation for the World
Championships in Tokyo, Japan,
the duo has reviewed their per-
formance after each competition
to make sure their skating skills
are continuously progressing.
"We want to make sure we're
happy with what we put on the
ice," Davis said.
Their practice schedule, which
Davis and White also had last
season, involves about four hours
of skating a day and an hour and
a half of physical training off the
ice. White said this intense prep-
aration is necessary because it's
the only way to overcome nerves.
But White said after dealing
with the pressure of the Olympic
games, he has become less ner-
vous in subsequent competitions.
"I think having been through
the stress and coming away
unscathed, let alone with a sil-
ver medal, has given me a better
grasp on how to deal with the
rigors and trying not to worry too
much about competition because
I survived the biggest one," he
said.
Davis added that she doesn't
think their lives have altered
greatly since the Olympics.
"The only thing that's really
changed is how people look at
us," she said. "People recognize
us a bit more."
But achieving their Olympic
dream involved making some
sacrifices. White said the biggest
sacrifice has been their educa-
tion.

"We both would have loved
to graduate from U of M in four
years, but obviously that's just not
attainable with our schedules,"
he said.
Davis and White have junior
standing as a result of each tak-
ing two courses a semester,
though they aren't currently
enrolled. Because of their dif-
ficult competition schedule
this season, White said they
might try to take online classes
through the University's Dear-
born campus in the future since
taking a full load of classes in
Ann Arbor would be impossible
to fit into their daily lives.
"We're both looking forward
to havingcareers once were done
with skating in something else,"
he said. "We don't want to be left
too far behind and to have to go
back to school so little by little
we're chipping away."
Davis said despite the gruel-
ing daily schedule, practice is fun
because the duo is trying out new
routines like a sensual tango.
"We've been exploring a dif-
ferent side of our skating," she
said.
Despite his current love for
ice dancing, White said he didn't
always think he would make it to
such a prestigious level of com-
petitive skating. He began skat-
ing at age 3 and played hockey
until it began to affect his pos-
ture. As a result, he took up ice
dancing.
White said he realized what
they could accomplish at age 18,
when he and Davis began com-
peting at the senior level - the
highest skill level designated by
the United States Figure Skating
Association.
"We were competing against
people that we had watched on
the Olympics and idolized grow-
ing up, and suddenly we were
on the same stage they were,"
he said. "We would go to com-
petitions, and I would compare

myself to them, and I started to born campus and the American stand that better," Hanlon said at

Though he has found suc-

like many University students,
he isn't sure what his eventual
career will be.

Motor City makeover
Chrysler creates good PR for struggling Detroit
t's no secret that the city of Detroit has seen better days. Vacant
lots, abandoned buildings and a high crime rate now define the
Motor City in the minds of most Americans. Until recently, our
state's engine, the Big Three, was plagued by competitive foreign
automakers, a global recession and a lack of quality products. But
Detroit got the attention of millions of Americans thanks to a Chrys-
ler advertisement that aired during the Super Bowl. The advertise-
ment, featuring Detroit native Eminem, succeeds in giving Detroit an
iconic image - with hope for a second chance.

The two-minute advertisement for the 2011
Chrysler 200 sedan, titled "Born of Fire,"
aired to a record-breaking audience of more
than 111 million viewers, accordingto a Detroit
Free Press article. Super Bowl XLV was the
most-watched television program ever, giving
Detroit a rare, positive moment in the national
spotlight.
The advertisement, produced only weeks
before the Super Bowl, cost approximately $10
million to make. Chrysler should be applauded
for not just spending to boost its image, but the
image of the entire city. The advertisement
never mentions the car it intends to promote.
Instead, it advertises Detroit as a city that has
"been to hell and back," but still maintains
technological expertise that runs generations
deep. This selfless promotion of a city in des-
perate need of a better reputation was a bold
move by Chrysler that will hopefully pay off.
Calling attention to Detroit wouldn't have
been advisable or possible if the Big Three
hadn't recently stepped up their game. After
serious reorganization in the aftermath of
government bailouts and plummeting sales,
the Big Three have some of the strongest line-
ups on the market. They now build award-
winning products like the Chevrolet Volt, the
Ford Fusion and the Jeep Grand Cherokee

- products Detroit should be proud of. The
advertisement introduced Chrysler's new slo-
gan: "Imported from Detroit." It's uncommon
for an automaker - especially Italian-owned
Chrysler- to connect aproductto acity witha
less-than-glowing reputation, but the country
has been forced to recognize that innovation,
quality and excitement still exist in Detroit.
The advertisement's narrator admits that
the hardworking, iconic Detroit is "prob-
ably not the one you've been reading (about)
in the paper." Between crime rates, former
mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and city corruption,
Detroit has had more than its share of bad
publicity. Rolling Stone even called Detroit
"the most epic urban failure ever," inan article
from their March 5, 2009 issue. But that isn't
the whole story of a city that is trying to get
back on its feet. Detroit was once a hub city
for Michigan, and many believe that it will be
again. Detroiters and all Michiganders have
a responsibility to follow Chrysler's example
and support a city whose reputation is so vital
to the state.
The Big Three have returned from near
bankruptcy to profitability and innovation.
With their lead and the state's support, Detroit
has the ability to return to its status as a major
American city.

Unless you're
a member of the
Flat Earth Soci-
ety - yes, it does
exist - or one
who believes that JULIAN
footage of land- TOLES
ing on the moon
is some sort of
conspiratorial phantasm, then you
will likely accept the aforemen-
tioned statements as fact. But long
before the normalization of these
ideas, the masses classified them by
one, two-syllable word: crazy.
The path from the "crazy" to
"accepted" often requires a not-so-
smooth paradigm shift. Standing in
the face of popularly held beliefs is
hard work. And during this transi-
tion, the leaders of the new thought
streams often endure unrest, tur-
moil and, at times, persecution.
But suppose for a second that
we skipped this phase. What if,
instead, we encouraged "crazy"
ideas from the start? Would it lead
to uninhibited exchange and more
diverse discourse?
That question is rhetorical. The
answer is an emphatic yes.
Fortunately, University President
Mary Sue Coleman also agrees. Just
last August, in an interview with
Forbes magazine, Coleman empha-
sized the necessity of programs that
specifically "draw out ... innovative
thinkers ... (who are) willing to take
a risk on what some might call their
'crazy ideas.'"
"Encouraging crazy ideas." It
has a nice ring to it. So nice, in fact,

that it's the tagline for the upcoming
TEDxUofM conference scheduled
for April 8, 2011.
"But what's TEDx?"
Good question.
TED, founded in 1984, is a non-
profit organization devoted to "ideas
worth spreading." At three annual
conferences in Long Beach, Calif,
Palm Springs, Fla and Oxford, Great
Britain, TED brings together think-
ers, tinkerers and doers to share
with the world the subjects they're
most passionate about in the form of
an 18-minute speech, or TED talk.
The TEDx program allows com-
munities to independently organize
their own TED-like event. This will
be the second year for the Univer-
sity's version of the conference, and
with the 1,700-seat venue in the
Michigan Theatre, this year's event
has the potential to be the largest
TEDx event to date. To put things in
perspective: There have been more
than 1,500 TEDx conferences held
worldwide.
A dedicated group of students
at the University is pushing this,
ambitious goal forward with light-
ning-like swiftness and Prius-like
efficiency. They're assembling a
roster of presenters, performers and
audience members from all walks of
life, backgrounds and unique experi-
ences that deserve to be illuminated.
The student group seeks to make
this a University initiative. After all,
the TED brand and the University of
Michigan represent two of the most
respected and influential intellectu-
aljuggernauts in modernhistory. It's
the perfect marriage - la Michael
Jordan and basketball, Mayaeni
with an acoustic guitar or Bill Gates
and computers.
While the conference encourages
crazy ideas, its ultimate goal is lofti-
er - combining thought with action
and design with substance. It seeks

to take participants from "hmmm"
to the coveted "ahal" moment to
yield tangible interdisciplinary
engagement. In the spirit of TED,
cooperation and collaboration - not
competition - rally against the pre-
vailing rat race mentality that grade
distributions and curves perpetu-
ate. And with recent columns like
Erik Torenberg's (Find your inner
entrepreneur, 1/25/2011) and Jer-
emy Levy's (Think Outside the Box,
1/25/2011), it's clear that creativ-
ity ripples throughout the collective
consciousness oftoday's Wolverines.
TEDxUofM
talks highlight
creative thinkers.
To all of you who feel that you
may have ideas "crazy" enough:
This is your time. I urge students,
faculty and alumni to participate
in the sheer magic that is TEDx-
UofM by taking a personal stake in
showcasing to the world what the
University has to offer. This could
be simply telling a friend about the
event, or for those with higher aspi-
rations, volunteering to make the
vision a reality.
The mission behind the confer-
ence is modest, but its implications
have the power to change the way
we view and relate to others, our
world and "crazy" ideas. Be ahead
of the curve. Embrace thecraziness
from its genesis. Unless, of course,
you still think that the Earth is flat.
For that, Ican offer no advice.

The pregame shuffle

Despite the not-so-appetizing food and
the lack of an elevator, I love living in West
Quad Residence Hall. The convenient location
and lively atmosphere make it one of the best
places to live on campus. However, the joy of
living here is ruined by the constantly ringing
fire alarm. Since I began living in West Quad
this year, fire alarms have been a nightmare.
I've become accustomed to waking up to the
sound of the blaring alarm at absurd hours.
From Dec. 10-13 last semester, South Quad
and West Quad Residence Halls experienced
a total of eight fire alarms. The first alarm
rang in South Quad at 5 a.m., an unfortunate
time for students who rise early and those
who go to bed late. The following day, the fire
alarm went off much after midnight in both
South Quad and West Quad. Two days later,
I received an e-mail from my resident advis-
er informing my hall of a rumor that the fire
alarm would be pulled that evening to start
the annual snowball fight against South Quad.
The fire alarm did go off, once around mid-
night and again an hour later. The following
evening, the fire alarm went off in West Quad
for the fourth and final time that week. This
time, however, fire trucks stood outside the
dorm, and smoke was seen rising from a win-
dow. Even though a majority of the residents
evacuated, some decided to stay back in their
rooms. But are they to be blamed?
Students need to stop pulling the fire alarm.
The repeated pulling of the alarm has made
residents react to the emergency in a casual
way, with frustration and exasperation replac-
ing panic. Many students choose to stay in the
dorms because everyone - including the RAs
- knows it's a false alarm. On one occasion, I
even had to convince my roommate to evacu-
ate the dorm when she refused to, because she
had an exam the next day and was already suf-
fering from a disrupted sleep pattern, thanks
to the alarms.
Considering the recent small fires in South
Quad and the Michigan Union, it's frightening
to think of a real fire in your own dorm. The
only time that I saw fire trucks outside West
Quad, I was afraid of an actual fire. But it was
only a burst steam pipe that caused the smoke

and resulted in fire trucks arriving at the
scene. It's unclear why fire trucks don't arrive
each time the alarm is pulled. It would be a
waste of resources and time and I wouldn't
want that, but how is there a way for the fire
department to determine the authenticity of
the alarm?
The annual snowball fight, for all its charm,
deserves a mention in this article. Everyone
loves a good, competitive snowball fight. But
when the snowball is a chunk of ice, and the
target is someone's face, the game turns nasty.
I watched a girl get hit by ice on her forehead
and rush to the Union with blood running
down her face. She was just one of the victims
of the fight that night, many of whom were
forced to leave their rooms for fear of a fine or
- less likely - an actual fire.
In an e-mail, my RA stated that students
not evacuating during a fire alarm could
be fined. According to The Michigan Daily
article (In West Quad, a recent increase in
false fire alarms, officials say, 2/15/2010),
then-associate director of Housing Secu-
rity described the pulling of the fire alarm
as a "misdemeanor punishable by imprison-
ment for up to a year or fines of up to $1,000."
Despite the warnings over the years, students
in West Quad continue to pull the fire alarm.
Four weeks into this semester, and there had
already beenthree false alarms in West Quad,
one after midnight on Feb 2 - the night of the
blizzard when South Quad experienced three
false alarms.
University Housing officials have to find a
way to solve this problem. Despite the numer-
ous alarms, Housing Spokesman Peter Logan
said in an e-mail that Housing Security super-
visors say there hasn't been an increase in fire
alarms in West Quad this year. And according
to Logan, there are no problems with the func-
tioning of the fire alarm systems. Students
should understand that pulling the fire alarm
isn't funny, it causes alot of inconvenience and
it desensitizes students to the significance of
the alarm. University authorities should try to
curb this activity in any possible way.

J 's that time of the year, when
Valentine's Day is around the
corner and love is presumably
in the air. The
beginning of the
annual pregame
shuffle is also - B-
upon us. In an
annual tradition
for Greeks at the
University, the
time has come RYAN
for the process KNAPP
of pairing up
fraternities with
sororities. The tradition involves
fraternity men asking sorority
women to join them at their tailgates
in the fall, thus christening the term
pregame partner. The formal invita-
tion is extended in the form of a ser-
enade by the fraternity men to the
sorority of their choice. The soror-
ity then votes on its suitors and for-
mally accepts its fraternity of choice
through another formal presenta-
tion - perhaps through another ser-
enade or at another special event.
It's like high school prom all over
again, except this time with much
bigger stakes. Sitting in lecture halls,
I remember hearing chatter about
who's asking who and what fraterni-
ties are going to be paired with what
sororities. It's a fun process, and it
definitely keeps the dull month of
February interesting. Even if you
think the process is a little archaic
or silly, imagine fraternity men ban-
tering about what song to serenade
women with or what props to use.
The time spent creating a plan of
action with your brothers is definite-
ly a unique experience.
Having participated in several
serenades, I can say that the tradi-
tion is definitely one of my favorite

memories in the chapter. The entire
chapter spends weeks perfecting its
craft in hopes of creating the best
presentation to the sorority. Cook-
ie cakes, flowers, decorations and
props - nothing is off limits as the
men seek to do whatever possible to
impress the sorority of their choice.
Never in the history of the world
has a group of guys cared so much
about what a group of women has
thought of them.
The process has become such an
important part of Greek Life cul-
ture that every year fraternity guys
try to top past performances with
more creative and outlandish ideas.
I have to say my favorite story that
I have heard thus far comes from a
fraternity that serenaded the lucky
ladies to "I'm On a Boat", while they
were in fact on a boat. Parking their
vessel outside the sorority house,
one can only imagine what the
sorority house mother was thinking
at that moment.
After all of the suitors have
finished their wooing, the soror-
ity women vote on which chapter
to choose. I can only wonder what
criteria sorority women use in their
decision. There are usually more
than two fraternities who have
extended formal invitations to a spe-
cific sorority - after all, there are
more than 30 IFC fraternities and
16 Panhellenic sororities. I have yet
to be enlightened as to what actually
goes into the sorority's decision. I'm
convinced that sororities discuss the
topic for hours on end, only to come
to a deadlock, finally breaking the tie
by flipping a coin or picking the win-
ning fraternity's name out of a hat.
The funny thing is how much the
pregame shuffle mirrors the dichot-
omy between men and women. Guys

are almost always expected to make
the first move. Yet when a girl shoots
a guy down, it's no big deal, right?
There are other fish in the sea, and
there are plenty of other girls to ask
out. Yet, just like no girl wants to be
the back up, no sorority wants to
be a fraternity's second choice. The
fraternity that gets shot down often
scrambles to find a back up, des-
perately trying to convince its new
choice that they really wanted them
all along and that their presentation
to the first sorority was merely a
ruse to confuse other suitors of their
true intentions.
Serenading is
a tradition that
spans decades.
For those of you who are reading
this wondering, "Why should I care
about some tradition between fra-
ternity men and sorority women?"
perhaps the process is a little silly,
and perhaps there are more impor-
tant things to talk about, but for
Greeks across the University, it's the
opportunity to meet new individu-
als and to be involved in a tradition
that has spanned several decades.
The thought of our parents and rela-
tives discussing whether to serenade
a sorority to "Brown-eyed Girl" or
"My Girl" is a hilarious one, and Iam
glad that I had the opportunity to
participate in the tradition.

State (8-2 Big Ten, 20-3 overall)
is going to be a tough team to
beat. In fact, the Spartans' only
three blemishes on their record
have come from playing ranked
opponents, including NCAA
front-runner Baylor.
"There are people here who
haven't experienced a win
against (Michigan State)," senior
guard Veronica Hicks said after
the loss in early January.
"I have only experienced one
over the past four years, so it is
reallv frustrating We came out

trying to change that."
If the Wolverines (7-4, 14-9)
have proven one thing this sea-
son, it's that records and streaks
can be broken. In January,
Michigan entered Big Ten play
at 2-0 for the first time since
the 1999-2000 season. This was
upon the Wolverines beating
their third consecutive ranked
opponent, a feat that had never
been accomplished in program
history.
And now, with Michigan in
fourth place in the Big Ten, the
Wolverines have an opportunity
to finish as one of the top five
teams in the conference for the
first time in10 years.
But Michigan is going to
have to rely on more than just
a successful season to upset yet
another ranked opponent. The
Wolverines need all five starters
to be hot at the basket and their
post players to win some defen-
sive matchups.
Too often, Michigan has
been riding the back of one or
two players to win a game. In
the Wolverines' win over Illi-
nois last Sunday, Hicks tied her
career-high of 24 points, while
starting guards Carmen Reyn-
olds and Jenny Ryan each tal-
lied only five points. And junior
guard Courtney Boylan carried
a goose egg in both shots and
rebounds.
Similarly, in Michigan's loss
against Minnesota, sopho-
more center Rachel Sheffer and
Boylan contributed 23 of the
Wolverines' So points on the
night.
Michigan is at its best when
it spreads its offensive effort
across the lineup, but the greater

challenge for Friday might come
at the defensive end.
Redshirt junior forward
Lykendra Johnson and senior
forward Kalisha Keane lead
Michigan State on the attack,
both standing at 6-foot-1. Keane
averages 16 points and five
rebounds a game, while Johnson
tallies 11 points and 9 boards.
Johnson dominated Michigan in
its last contest against the Spar-
tans, notching 17 points and 17
rebounds.
She also grabbed 11 offensive
rebounds - more than all of the
Wolverines combined.
"I just want to pursue the
ball," Johnson said after the
win against Michigan. "I try to
get my hand on every ball I can
because I know if I can do that, I
can grab the rebound."
The Wolverines may have had
trouble against Johnson early
in the season, but Sheffer and
sophomore guard Kate Thomp-
son have since developed into
strong defenders at the post,
shutting down some of the Big
Ten's best players.
The duo held Ohio State's
three-time Big Ten Player of
the Year Jantel Lavender to a
career-low 10 points in a 69-66
victory two weeks ago.
Michigan has the athleticism
to beat the Spartans, as long
as its starters can create some
offense and defend the post area
like they have done in a handful
of games this season.
"We gotta get ourselves ener-
gized because Michigan State
is obviously an in-state rivalry,"
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth
said. "It's a big game we want to
be ready for."

team always prepares for and

when the opposing mascot is the
Buckeye.

slide has been
more of a speed Where Yost
more Ice Arena
bump than the
beginning of a TV/Radio:
free-fall. BTN
"We try and
put last weekend behind us,"
senior forward Matt Rust said
Wednesday. "The reason we're
losing is not because of the other
team, but because of our own
lapses. We're trying to focus on
the things that we need to do
better. When the time comes to
watch video, we'll watch video.
But I think we're addressing our
own issues more so right now."
Michigan currently boasts an
eight-game win streak at home
and will face two games against
the Buckeyes (9-11-2-2 CCHA,
14-13-2 overall) in the friendly
confines of Yost Ice Arena on Fri-
day and Saturday.
The Wolverines (14-7-1-0,
17-9-4) know how critical home
ice can be to their success. After
dropping both decisions against
Miami (Ohio) last weekend - the
first time the team has been on
the losing end of a series sweep
this season - a home series
couldn't come at a better time for
Michigan.

"Most teams have a better
record at home," Michigan coach
Red Berenson said. "We have
a good record at home, but you
have to play well. That's huge.
If we play well, our fans get into
it, you can build momentum in
this building. It can be a terrific
home-ice advantage, but it all
startswith if you play well."
The Wolverine offense is cur-
rently ranked 20th in the nation,
but while Michigan is averaging
3.27 goals per game, it has scored
just three goals in its past three
games.
The only Wolverines to find
the net during Michigan's cur-
rent three-game losing streak are
senior forward Louie Caporusso
and sophomore forward A.J.
Treais, whose two goals against
Miami last Friday marked the
first two-goal game of his career.
After being shut out for just
the second time this season - a
3-0 series finale loss at the hands
of the RedHawks last Saturday
- Berenson gave each line a new
look at Monday's practice. Beren-
son made changes to all four of
the Wolverines' lines, hopingthat
the shake-up will help ignite the
Michigan offense.
"It isn't really a message,
(Berenson is) just trying some-
thing new," Rust said. "Everyone
on this team has talent. Changing
up the lines just gives everyone a
fresh start, gives everyone a new
jump start in their game and kind
of makes everyone more excited
to play."
Michigan hopes the two games
against Ohio State will be just the
"jump start" this team needs, as
each weekend moves them closer
and closer to the end of the regu-
lar season.
The Wolverines split their
first series of the season with the

Buckeyes back in early Decem-
ber, but both squads know they
will be facing different teams
this weekend. Ohio State split last
weekend's series with Michigan
State and comes into Yost tied for
seventh placein the CCHA, while
the RedHawks' weekend sweep
of Michigan puts the Wolverines
two points behind Miami and in
third place in the conference.
After giving up three power
play goals in Oxford last weekend
and going 0-for-12 on their own
power play chances, Berenson
addressed both sides of the spe-
cial teams issues in practice this
week.
Miami's power play currently
ranks second in the nation and
has scored 12 more goals on the
man-advantage than Ohio State,
but the Wolverines are con-
cerned with improving their own
penalty killing and defense head-
ing into this weekend.
"We were not surprised (by
Miami). We went in and played
well, we played hard," Beren-
son said. "Everybody knew they
were vying for first place before
the season started. We're not
surprised by that, but we're dis-
appointed in the way that we
handled it, whether it was defen-
sively, offensively or special
teams."
With just three series remain-
ing in the regular season for
Michigan and a traffic jam among
the top of the CCHA, the Wolver-
ines know now more than ever
how precious each point really is.
"I think that the adversity is
going to help us," sophomore for-
ward Chris Brown said. "We're
going to come out strong this
weekend and really show that
those last three games were a
fluke and that we should have
played a lot better."

We're days away from Valen-

students purchase and butter

hoping for one thing: sex. And
what goes better with sex than

A friend once told me: "The
only thing better than sex is

The combination? Sex playl-

Jason Reece Superbal
- the cen- eb
tral creative
members of the band - incor-
porate exaggerated guitar riffs
and audaciously bold percussion
in an effusive display of progres-
sive rock. As a quasi-conceptual
album, it's well rounded, but the
tracks can be difficult to distin-
guish from one another.
That's not to say the album is
one entire song - there are a few
points, especially at the begin-
ning, when the Texan rock-
ers manage to deviate enough
from the formula to produce
a few notable tracks. "Pure
Radio Cosplay," which follows
an experimental introduction,
employs an alternating tempo
and a spacey synthesizer to
establish the atmosphere. "The
Wasteland" is serene and calm

where the majority of Tao of the
Dead is not, providing an appro-
priately positioned reprieve
from the musical turbulence.
"Summer of All Dead Souls,"
the album's first single, will give
head-bangers a sense of satisfac-
tion, but really any fan of heavy
strumming and nifty riffs will
find it a success.
Tao of the Dead is clearly cre-
ated in the image of Pink Floyd's
Dark Side of the Moon and Rush's
Hemispheres. While it never
matches up to either (as few ever
could), Trail of Dead's attempt
is a valiant effort in mimick-
ing the shape of a story arc:
rising tension and a few break-
out moments, culminating in a
16-minute finale of shredding
guitars and crashing cymbals.
The tracks tend to run into each
other, picking up immediately
where another leaves off, but
they prove to come together in a
nuanced and complete creation.
The deeper the listener ven-
tures into Tao, the more troubles
arise. The four-piece band seems
to run out of steam and gets
bogged down in adhering too
much to the same general sound.
Fortunately, that sound isn't nec-
essarily bad, but the lack of vari-
ation results in eventual tedium.
"Pure Radio Cosplay (Reprise)"
is true to its title in its unfail-
ing repetition of the previous

"Pure Radio Cosplay." "The Spi-
ral Jetty," clocking in under two
minutes, is uninspired and seems
like an afterthought. It would be
rash to call this lapse in viable
material the album's downfall,
but it's disappointing to see how
much of a complete success Tao
could have been if the quality of
the music remained constant.
And you will
know them
by the trail of
good tunes.
Trail of Dead's seventh studio
release is a worthy effort, but it
demonstrates a lack of finesse in
not finishing strong. The album
isn't disjointed because it flows
together so well, but it clearly
rises in the beginning and ebbs
near its conclusion. As most
bands learn the hard way, a con-
cept album is an extremely risky
venture. Trail of Dead claims
that Tao is such a venture, but on
what concept the album is predi-
cated seems unclear. Regardless,
the music is still enjoyable with
or without a theme, making it a
risk well taken.

Polish pianist plays A2

Ski porn comes to
Michigan with 'The
Way I See It'
By ANDREW LAPIN
DailyArts Writer
Ann Arbor has always been
known as a supportive environ-
ment for off-the-grid films and
filmmakers. And
tomorrow, as a
fundraiser for the The Way
Projectorhead I See It
film series from
the University's Tomorrow
Department of at 8 p.m.
Screen Arts and MichiganTheater
Cultures, the $15
Michigan Theater
will play host to
the latest entry in the ever-grow-
ing genre of ski porn.
Wait a minute. Ski porn?
"People in the Midwest and East
don't know that term," said SAC
department chair Markus Nornes,
who organized Saturday's screen-
ing and will be handing out swag
to audience members beforehand.
"But in the West, where I come
from, that's what everybody calls
ski documentaries."
Nornes, an avid skier and native
of Fort Collins, Colo., specializes in
documentary study and bills him-
self as the only ski porn scholar in
the world. Of course, around here,
he has to make sure to clarify
himself when usingtheterm. 4-
"Everyone has their clothes
on, and in fact they
have so many clothes
that you usually can't
tell the girls from the
boys," Nornes said. But \
people in Michigan don't
understand his passion.
One Detroit ski club called
him to clarify there wasn'te
any unseemly material in the
movie before committing to ,
attend.
Films in the ski porn genre con-
sist almost entirely of professional

athletes skiing and performing
tricks in exotic locations. Its roots
go as far back as the '40s, when the
genre's godfather, Warren Miller,
started filming his friends turn-
ing tricks on the slopes so he could
study their technique. But he found
that his videos had an eager audi-
ence when screened in ski towns,
so Miller took his work on tour and
began churning out ski documen-
taries at an incredibly prolific rate,
camping out by the slopes when he
wasn't filming.
Though Miller was the original
ski pornographer, and his name-
sake production studio is still con-
sidered a name brand for extreme
ski videos, other companies have
risen to prominence in the last
decade. These include Matchstick
Productions, based in Crested
Butte, Colo., which is responsible
for tomorrow's film selection, "The
Way I See It."
So those looking for "Deep
Throat" in the snow will be disap-
pointed. But what makes the image
of people sailing through the air on
skis so compulsively watchable?
"If you ski, it's transfixing, you
know? You can't take your eyes off
it," Nornes said. "And if you go to
the theater, people are yelling and
screaming and shouting out. If
someone crashes, you hear every-
body going'Aah!"'
In Nornes's research, he's
found that certain pathways in
the brain - called "mirror neu-

rons" - light up when the subject
performs certain activities, acting
as pleasure centers. And for some-
one who finds, say, the act of skiing
pleasurable, even watching other
people ski will activate those same
centers.
"Just watching someone grace-
fully go down the mountain is
bliss," Nornes said.
Outfits like Matchstick Produc-
tions have the added benefit of
showingski action from all over the
world, including the most treach-
erous terrain from Japan, Swit-
zerland, British Columbia, Alaska
and the American West. So it's a
vicarious experience for those ski-
ers who will never have the chance
to hit those faraway slopes them-
selves. And the advent of YouTube,
with its multitudes of amateur ski
pornographers, has only increased
interest in the professionally made
selections.
During the year, Projectorhead
screens a wide variety of films
- everything from the "Lord of.
the Rings" movies to "West of the
Tracks," a nine-hour documentary
about Chinese industrial workers.
So a ski porn selection actually fits
right into the organization's mold.
And there's enough of a fanbase
for the genre in Ann Arbor to war-
rant the screening - it's a common
stop on the world tours of Warren
Miller films.
Though Nornes could go on dis-
secting the development of genre
aesthetics over ski porn's history-
includingthe mixtures of film and
hi-def video and Match-
stick's innovative use of
helicopters - on Sat-
urday, he'll be content
simply to kick back and
watch other people ski.
"I'm getting excited
just talking about it,"
he said.

"I was very fascinated by
organ music, and I wanted to

Blechacz said in a recent phone
