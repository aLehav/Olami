Thursday morning, hundreds 
of students, faculty, alumni 
and community members filled 
the new home of the Trotter 
Multicultural Center on South 
State 
Street. 
University 
of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel, Regent Ron Weiser 
and Cynthia Stephens, the 1st 
District Court of Appeals judge, 
were among the speakers at 
the Trotter Center’s opening 
ceremony.
Alphonse Pitawanakwat, a 
lecturer in the Native American 

Ojibwe language, opened up the 
ceremony, acknowledging the 
new Trotter Center’s location 
on land previously inhabited 
by the Ojibwe, Odawa and 
Potawatomi tribes.
In 
his 
opening 
remarks, 
Schlissel 
spoke 
about 
the 
importance of the new center’s 
establishment.
“This is a historic occasion, 
not just for the University of 
Michigan, but for our students 
and graduates, the society we 
serve, and really, the shared 
future that we’re all hoping to 
create,” Schlissel said. “The 
Trotter Multicultural Center is 

a new home for many personal 
and shared identities, for unity, 
for learning, for reflection and 
for hope.”
The new Trotter Center’s 
opening 
was 
the 
result 
of 
decades of petitioning from 
student 
activist 
groups, 
specifically the Black Student 
Union. At the beginning of 
2014, as part of a greater list 
of 
demands 
for 
expanded 
scholarships, 
more 
student 
diversity and more equitable 
housing 
opportunities, 
the 
student group petitioned the 
University to move the Trotter 
Center 
from 
its 
previous 

location, 
a 
15-minute 
walk 
to 
Central 
Campus 
from 
Washtenaw Avenue, to a more 
accessible location on Central 
Campus.
In late 2013, members of 
BSU popularized the hashtag 
#BBUM, or “Being Black at 
the University of Michigan,” 
prompting 
a 
campus-wide 
movement to increase equity 
in admissions, resources and 
student 
opportunities, 
as 
well as offering a space for 
Black students to share their 
experiences on campus.

The Matthaei Botanical 
Gardens 
hosted 
a 
photography 
exhibit 
Thursday titled “Finding the 
Strength to Heal: A Journey 
of 
Rebuilding 
Amongst 
Violence.” The exhibit, a 
product of Rackham student 
Laura Sinko’s dissertation, 
told the stories of women 
who survived sexual violence 
as undergraduates through 

pictures, quotes and videos. 
Attendees 
perused 
different 
rooms 
of 
the 
building, 
each 
with 
a 
different focus. One room 
played a video on a loop 
highlighting 
the 
journeys 
of four participants in the 
project, while another, titled 
the 
self-care 
room, 
held 
crafts and stress balls. The 
conservatory itself was used 
as the resource room, where 
information 
booths 
from 
various University resources 

including 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention and Awareness 
Center, 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological 
Services, 
U-M 
Police 
Department 
Special Victims Unit, Office 
of Institutional Equity and 
University Health Services 
sexual 
assault 
nurse 
examiners 
were 
stationed 
throughout the plants.
Attendees followed arrows 
in a winding path in the main 
photography exhibit room, 
accented by twinkling lights 

and calm music. Photographs 
and quotes from survivors 
were organized on a series of 
panels, each corresponding 
to a different theme. The 
first row was made up of 
general themes of the healing 
process, 
the 
second 
row 
focused on darker and more 
vulnerable moments within 
the process and the final row 
consisted of more specific 
day-to-day ups and downs.
University of Michigan students 
and 
faculty 
discussed 
legacy 
admissions and their Constitutional 
implications in Hutchins Hall on 
Thursday afternoon. The Education 
Law and Policy Society hosted the 
event to focus on admissions from 
an equal protection standpoint.
The discussion began with 
the panel addressing the ubiquity 
of legacy admissions in highly 
selective 
institutions. 
Michael 
Bastedo, 
School 
of 
Education 
professor, specializes in higher 
education admissions research. He 
said legacy commonly plays a role in 
undergraduate admissions.
“Primarily at the undergraduate 
level, it’s pretty common,” Bastedo 
said. “It’s more unusual not to 
practice legacies than it is to 
practice legacies.”
The question was then directed 
to Margo Schlanger, the panel’s 
legal expert and University Law 
School 
professor, 
on 
whether 
legacy admits violated the equal 
protection clause of the U.S. 
Constitution.

Sankofa: 
Trotter looks 
towards new 
beginnings

Central location just one step in a 
larger journey to equity on campus

Approximately 
150 
students, 
faculty and community members 
were in attendance for a series of 
performances in an event titled 
“Young, Latinx and Proud” hosted 
by 
the 
Latin@ 
Culture 
Show 
and sponsored by Department of 
American Culture and Latino/a 
Studies on Thursday night. The 
event featured several groups that 
presented dances and songs from 
different Latinx cultures.
LSA senior Karen Garcia, one of 
the organizers, said the show takes a 
lot of careful planning beginning in 
the fall.
“It’s a lot of work,” Garcia said. 
“The day of, we get here early, make 
sure everyone is ready, everyone is 
in positions, make sure we have a 
backup plan if we have a hiccup, so it’s 
a lot of work throughout the year, but 
it’s also very rewarding.”
The performers ranged from 
elementary schoolers to college 
students, and included songs and 
dances inspired by the traditional 
styles from Mexico, Peru, the 
Dominican Republic and more.

On Thursday, generations 
of students and alumni joined 
in unity to welcome the grand 
opening of the new Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center 
on 
Central Campus. Forged from 
decades’ worth of student 
activism, largely spearheaded 
by the Black Student Union, 
Trotter opened its doors to 
the public and community 
during a historic community 
gathering. Students, alumni, 
faculty and staff lined the 
basement from wall-to-wall, 
nearly reaching capacity. The 
space, amalgamating the past 
and the present, produced a 
tangible reward for all the 
blood, sweat and tears poured 
into making the new Trotter 
Center a reality. 
The Trotter Center’s new 
space, 
placed 
on 
Central 
Campus’ South State Street, 

is a direct result of Black 
student activism on campus, 
dating all the way back to the 
1970s with the Black Action 
Movement . Since then, the 
Black Student Union has 
continued these efforts with 
various social movements, 
a focal point being its 2013 
#BBUM (Being Black at the 
University 
of 
Michigan) 
Twitter 
movement. 
In 
addition to launching the 
viral social media campaign, 
BSU 
released 
a 
list 
of 
demands, one of them being 
an opportunity to congregate 
at a new Trotter Center on 
Central Campus.
Tyrell Collier, speaker of 
Black Student Union during 
#BBUM, spoke at the ribbon-
cutting about the persistence 
of Black student activists on 
campus and paid homage 
to organizations like BAM 
and the Students of Color 
Coalition that came before 
him.

Thursday, more than 150 
students, alumni, faculty, donors 
and community members — 
including 
demonstrators 
— 
gathered in the University of 
Michigan Biological Sciences 
Building for a ribbon cutting 
ceremony and to hear remarks 
from University President Mark 
Schlissel and other campus 
leaders. Interim LSA Dean 
Elizabeth Cole began the event 
by thanking those who have 
dedicated time and resources 
to the building and noted many 
people may not be aware of 
the amount of work and many 
different types of work that 
went into its creation.
“When the college began 
designing this building, they 
recognized 
that 
science 
is 
more 
collaborative 
and 
interdisciplinary than it was 
in the past,” Cole said. “The 
BSB was conceptualized as a 
place that would not only foster 

great innovations in biological 
sciences but would also be 
the kind of space that would 
encourage collaboration and 
would be a bridge for the public 
to explore the research that is 
being done here. Now, as we 
stand here today, this building is 
changing the nature of the work 
we do for faculty, students and 
staff alike, and it’s changing the 
way we achieve our mission to 
share our work with others.”
The 
312,000-square-foot 
building sits near the Central 
Campus 
Transit 
Center 
and the Hill Neighborhood 
bridge. It was approved by 
the 
University’s 
Board 
of 
Regents with a $261 million 
price tag in early 2014 to give 
the Ecology and Evolutionary 
Biology and Molecular, Cellular, 
and 
Developmental 
Biology 
departments a better working 
space than the deteriorating 
104-year-old Kraus Building.
In 2017, the Museum of 
Natural 
History 
announced 
plans to join the EEB and 

MCDB departments in the 
new building, and the building 
now also houses the Museum 
of Paleontology faculty and 
staff. The Ruthven Museums 
Building, 
which 
formerly 
housed the Museum of Natural 
History, 
will 
be 
the 
new 
headquarters 
for 
University 
administration 
when 
the 
Fleming 
Administration 
Building is demolished.
Cole said the building houses 
teaching 
collections, 
the 
museum, offices, classrooms, 
social 
spaces 
and 
labs, 
among other things. She said 
the 
BSB’s 
layout 
enhances 
education quality and allows 
for interactive teaching and 
researching.
Additionally, Cole noted the 
BSB’s “research neighborhoods,” 
which require researchers to 
share space, equipment and ideas. 
She said this is one example of 
collaboration becoming the norm 
in the new building. Like other 
speakers at the event, Cole said 
she hoped the BSB could serve 
as a bridge for the general 
public to see the University’s 
research.
“This space is really an 
opportunity 
for 
visitors 
to connect with science,” 
Cole said. “You can’t deny 
the excitement that the 
new spaces bring, nor the 
immediate impact the BSB 
has already had on that 
promise. And I’m thrilled 
by the potential and the 
possibility that are held in 
this space, and I think you 
will be, too, as you get to see 
it.”
Schlissel 
began 
his 
remarks by acknowledging 
the 
alumni 
and 
donors 
present at the event. He 
said 
the 
University 
has 
been a leader in the past, 
and this building will help 
the University tackle the 
biological questions of the 
future.
Schlissel 
also 
said 
the 
University’s 
many 
disciplines, resources and 
tools position it to redefine 
boundaries and help broaden 

understanding of the natural 
world and biological problems. 
The BSB in particular will make 
the University’s work accessible to 
the general public, Schlissel said.
“I am confident that this 
building and its resources will 
bring us closer to answering 
some 
of 
life 
science’s 
most 
pressing questions of today and 
of 
tomorrow,” 
Schlissel 
said. 
“It 
represents 
our 
enduring 
commitment to better understand 
the world around us.”
Schlissel 
thanked 
his 
predecessor, staff and regents for 
their ongoing support and said the 
ribbon cutting launched a new era 
of discovery at the University.
When 
Schlissel 
began 
his 
remarks, climate demonstrators 
displayed 
posters 
relating 
to 
climate 
change, 
the 
Climate 
Action 
Movement, 
carbon 
neutrality 
and 
fossil 
fuels 
from the second floor directly 
behind Schlissel’s podium. The 
Climate Action Movement has 
been critical of Schlissel for not 
committing the University to 
carbon neutrality by 2030, the 
inclusion of representatives from 
statewide energy providers on 
his President’s Commission on 
Carbon Neutrality and for the 
University’s decision not to divest 
from companies that produce 
fossil fuels.
The Climate Action Movement 
organized 
the 
March 
15 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate 
Strike, which brought upwards 
of 3,000 people to the Diag, and 
a subsequent sit-in at Schlissel’s 
office, which led to 10 arrests.
In an email to The Daily 
following an April 9 special public 
session, at which none of their 
demands were met, some student 
demonstrators present at the event 
wrote they felt they needed to 
take more visible and potentially 
disruptive actions.
“The 
Museum 
of 
Natural 
History is dedicated to studying, 
preserving, and teaching about 
ecology, biodiversity and life on 
Earth,” the email read.

LSA freshman Atticus Raasch on his story “Schlissel addresses student 
concerns at carbon neutrality public session”:

“I think just being able to hear the viewpoints of all of the students and community 
members who were showing their discontent for a lot of the things that have been 
happening regarding climate change and carbon neutrality practices on this campus. I 
know that this event was kind of in response to some of the demands or just the wants of 
some of the people who went and protested at the Fleming Administration Building which 
led to 10 people being arrested. So I think this was a really key community moment for a lot 
of these people who really care about carbon neutrality on campus. So I think it was really 
exciting to be able to hear everyone’s passion and to hear how much they care about the 
issue.”

“I think there’s no shortage of passions on this campus. I think everyone throughout the 
entire event was very vocal. A lot of people were not afraid to throw in cheers, boos, even 
interrupt Schlissel at a lot of moments, which I think was really telling of the event. Just 
being able to catch people on their way out and just trying to talk to as many people as I 
could about what they thought of the event was kind of the best way to go about that.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

I think this is a powerful and emotional experience for a lot of 
people who love the University, who want the University to be a 
place where everyone feels they have a home and they belong ... 
I think what’s wonderful about the new location is that it’s in the 
heart of campus … so what we’re saying is that’s in the heart of 
who we are, what we do and what we’re committed to … For me, 
the new Trotter is about a new beginning on our campus with 
each other and for each other.”

E. Royster Harper, vice president for student life, during the Trotter to Trotter Community Walk, which took place on Wednesday, the 
day before the grand opening of the new Trotter Multicultural Center on State Street

“It really started decades 
and decades ago when folks 
were calling for a new Trotter 
to recognize Black student 
rights in general, since the ’70s 
and ’80s and ’90s,” he said.
Collier earned his Bachelor 
of Arts in Afroamerican and 
African Studies and Sociology 
from the University in 2014. He 
currently serves as the senior 
coordinator 
of 
operations 
for Relay Graduate School of 
Education in New York City. 
At the Trotter Center, Collier 
remarked 
on 
the 
palpable 
energy 
surrounding 
the 
groundbreaking day and spoke 
of his hopes for the future.
“Walking 
through 
this 
building, 
I 
got 
emotional. 
Going into the Sankofa Lounge, 
seeing all those photos, it 
means a lot. I just hope from 
here on out that history isn’t 
lost and that this still remains 
a beacon and a sanctuary for 
students of color. But, like I 
said, I always mention the 
Black student organizations 
because Trotter started off 
as the Black house and then 
it moved to the multicultural 
center. I just want to make sure 

that this remains a house and 
a safe space for Black students 
here on campus.”
This sentiment of paying 
homage to those who came 
before was a common thread 
in many of the words orated 
by the other speakers at the 
ribbon-cutting 
ceremony. 
The Honorable Cynthia D. 
Stephens, 
the 
1st 
District 
Court of Appeals judge and a 
University alum, made sure 
to give thanks to Thaddeus 
R. Harrison, the only student 
activist 
with 
a 
criminal 
conviction for his role in BAM 
that has not been overturned.
Student activism has been a 
driving force for the prosperity 
of these movements, and these 
efforts are apparent in the 
construction of the Trotter 
Center’s space. During all 
steps in the process of the 
Trotter Center’s design and 
planning of its architecture, 
student input was prioritized 
and 
integrated 
into 
the 
edification. 
Notably, 
the 
new Trotter Center features 
a community lounge titled 
Sankofa on the first floor, 
a name advocated by BSU 
Speaker Kayla McKinney and 
Secretary Camyrea Barnes.
Barnes spoke of the tireless, 
accumulative efforts of Black 

students who have fought 
for a space to share their 
experiences.
“I’m speechless. My heart 
is full right now. Just knowing 
the work and the efforts that 
many of the Black students on 
this campus have been putting 
into for 50 years now, and 
now that it’s being fulfilled, 
it’s like a full circle of life. It’s 
up for the future generation 
of Black students to keep the 
momentum going.”
E. Royster Harper, vice 
president 
for 
student 
life, 
reiterated this in her speech 
to the packed room in her 
anecdote 
concerning 
the 
significance of the Sankofa 
Lounge. Sankofa, originating 
from the Twi language of 
Ghana, is stylized by a bird 
with its head turned backward 
while its feet face forward. 
Like 
its 
symbol, 
Royster 
Harper 
urged 
community 
onlookers 
to 
acknowledge 
history and the efforts of the 
past while pursuing initiative 
for the future.
“In some ways, it really is 
Sankofa. It really is this idea of 
looking back and remembering 
your past and seeing what’s 
possible for the future. And 
that’s what it means to me, a 
combination of all of that, and 

to see all of the students and 
all of the work that has caused 
this to happen over time.” 
Elizabeth James, adviser 
for BSU, reflected on the deep 
significance of the Trotter 
Center’s 
revitalization 
of 
community on campus. James’ 
roots in the University span 
across generations, — both she 
and her mother attended the 
University, in addition to her 
27 years of working for U-M.
“For me, it’s really surreal 
to see a dream come true — 
(it) means more than I can 
even express in words. It’s 
the people, not the facility. 
We could meet at Angell 
Hall, but we would still be a 
community.”
Robert Sellers, vice provost 
for equity and inclusion and 
chief diversity officer, talked 
about the Trotter Center’s 
importance to the institution 
and 
its 
catalytic 
role 
in 
creating a brighter future.
“I 
am 
deeply 
touched, 
deeply moved. The fact that 
we, as an institution, are able 
to mark this moment in time 
as a way of both symbolizing 
the incredible work that the 
BSU and many students before 
the current BSU (have done) 
in terms of trying to move the 
University forward to become 

the institution that it can be, 
it should be, and that it needs 
to be, I think this is one more 
milestone, but it is not the 
endpoint, and in many ways, it 
is a new beginning.”
Michigan 
in 
Color 
commends 
the 
continuous 
efforts of students of color 
on campus and the plethora 
of community members and 
alumni that have supported 
these initiatives throughout 
the 
years. 
We 
hope 
that 
students of color will feel 
empowered, represented and 
grounded in their rightful 
place 
at 
this 
University 
and institutions like it. We 
welcome students of color 
from 
all 
backgrounds 
to 
revel in this space explicitly 
grounded 
in 
intercultural 
engagement, inclusivity and 
activism.
But while the center is 
a positive step in the right 
direction, it is only one step 
in a larger journey. As the 
new Trotter Center begins to 
solidify its place on campus, 
students will continue to make 
strides in current and novel 
initiatives 
towards 
equity, 
inclusion, 
representation 
and unity at the University’s 
campus and beyond.

While many of BSU’s original 
demands were not fully met, 
five years later the University 
has granted the student body 
the new $10 million facility 
intended 
to 
house 
student 
organizations, lounge spaces 
and student resources as well as 
act as a safe space for minority 
communities on campus.
University 
alum 
Brittney 
Williams, 
a 
former 
BSU 
executive 
board 
member, 
attended the opening ceremony. 
According to Williams, while 
BSU members several years 
ago made the final push toward 
a new multicultural center, 
the original movement had 
its roots in decades of student 
protest and activism.
“The 
Black 
Action 
Movements were what started 
(the push for a new Trotter 
Center),” Williams said. “There 
were three, in 1970, 1975 and 
1987, and then a lot of people 
consider #BBUM to be kind of 
like an honorary BAM four. So 
I think a lot of the reason why 
people are so emotional today 
is because it’s almost 50 years 
of a push for us to have a space, 
not only like this but also 
actually on campus as opposed 
to where the old Trotter was.”
Tyrell 
Collier, 
speaker 
of BSU during the #BBUM 
movement in 2013, echoed 
Williams’ sentiments in his 
remarks to attendees during 
the opening ceremony.
“Make no mistake, we would 
not be here if it were not for 
the students who fought for 
this very moment,” Collier 

said. “When I see this building, 
I’m reminded of the Black 
Action Movements that shook 
this University to its core in 
response to racist incidents 
on campus, and in an effort to 
recognize Black student rights. 
I’m reminded of the Students of 
Color Coalition’s early 2000s 
takeover 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Union tower. I’m reminded 
of the multiple takeovers of 
the Fleming Administration 
Building 
by 
Black 
student 
activists. 
I’m 
reminded 
of 
my peers, who due to their 
dedication to this work, had 
to take on additional years at 
this University to graduate, 
and those who never made it to 
graduation at all.”
Williams herself was one 
of these students, as she was 
a member of BSU from 2005 
to 2011, and ultimately earned 
her bachelor’s degree from the 
University in 2016. According 
to Williams, during her time 
with BSU, minority students 
had to work around a number 
of obstacles in order to achieve 
a sense of community in the 
Trotter Center.
“We were meeting a lot with 
administration, and also with 
our leadership … to talk about 
ways that we could continue 
to make the space that we 
were in on Washtenaw more 
welcoming, but also to figure 
out ways to get a little bit 
closer,” Williams said. “We 
also 
started 
the 
campaign 
where we were having students 
meet up and walk together to 
Trotter for BSU meetings. So 
we kind of had to do the best 
we could with what we had, 
while still pushing at the top to 
get something better.”
With regard to the center’s 

2019 reopening, Collier also 
cited the support of Elizabeth 
James, a member of BSU 
during the late ’70s and current 
program 
associate 
of 
the 
Department of Afroamerican 
and African Studies.
“When I see this building, I 
am reminded of our immensely 
selfless elder, Ms. Elizabeth 
James, 
whose 
unwavering 
support never let the fight die 
off in between generations, 
whose steadfast leadership has 
guided us always in the right 
direction and whose wisdom 
has comforted us in some of 
our darkest moments,” Collier 
said in his remarks. “Ms. Beth, 
if it were up to me, this building 
would be named after you.”
Along 
with 
BSU’s 
foundational 
role 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
new 
multicultural center, speakers 
at 
the 
center’s 
opening 
ceremony also emphasized the 
role of the center as a space 
for minority students of all 
backgrounds to find resources 
and a community.
Taubman 
junior 
Juan 
Muñoz, a representative from 
the Student Community of 
Progressive 
Empowerment, 
explained the importance of 
the center’s reopening to the 
Latinx community.
“Trotter, for our community, 
has just been a place of 
gathering and a place of comfort 
and space for our community 
to come together,” Muñoz said. 
“We just really appreciate how 
it’s more centralized and that 
makes us feel more included 
on campus. I think that this 
building does a really good job 
of acknowledging all of the 
impact people before us had 
and how they’ve impacted our 

communities and our ability to 
feel welcome on campus.”
Public Policy junior Arwa 
Gayar, the co-president of the 
Arab 
Student 
Association, 
echoed 
Muñoz’s 
sentiments 
about 
the 
convenience 
of 
a centrally located Trotter 
Center.
“A lot of the Arab students, 
when 
they 
come 
together 
after class, they’re usually in 
the Fishbowl and last year it 
would be in the basement of 
the Union,” Gayar said. “So a 
lot of our communities were 
very fragmented. We think 
that Trotter is going to be 
a really good place for us to 
come together and foster those 
natural relationships between 
our communities. I also think 
that ASA being an umbrella 
org over a very diverse group 
of organizations, we have a 
variety of programming and I 
think that Trotter, in terms of 
the intention of the space, is a 
perfect place for all of that.”
According to Muñoz, the 
newly established center also 
represents a willingness of 
University administration to 
work with minority students 
on the issues they face in a 
college setting. As a member 
of SCOPE, which works to 
expand 
opportunities 
for 
undocumented 
students 
on 
campus, 
he 
explains 
this 
cooperation 
from 
administration is particularly 
needed 
to 
address 
certain 
student concerns.
“Currently we’re facing a 
struggle with the 28-month 
policy, 
a 
clause 
within 
a 
policy that prevents DACA, 
or 
undocumented 
transfer 
students, 
from 
receiving 
in-state tuition,” Muñoz said. 

“We (hope to) receive support 
from the public and raise 
awareness on this issue that 
it is preventing students from 
receiving education.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Sandra 
Perez, also a member of SCOPE 
present on Thursday, built off 
Muñoz’s comments, explaining 
the effect of such policies 
on undocumented Michigan 
residents hoping to achieve 
higher education.
“It personally affects Juan 
himself, and my brother,” Perez 
said. “My brother just received 
(notice) today that he was 
denied in-state classification, 
while I have been living with 
him for so many years, and was 
granted in-state classification. 
So now he’s an out-of-state 
student, and I’m an in-state 
student, and that’s preventing 
him 
from 
coming 
to 
this 
university.”
Looking back on the goals 
set out by BSU five years ago to 
eliminate similar institutional 
obstacles 
facing 
minority 
students, Collier recognized 
the 
difficulty 
of 
achieving 
change on issues of equity and 
inclusion.
“I just want everybody to 
know that this moment didn’t 
come easy; no one should leave 
here thinking that this came 
easy,” Collier said. “Nothing 
that is right and just usually 
comes easy. I think the idea of 
diversity is a bit on trend now, 
but getting institutions like 
this university that we all love 
to put time, energy and money 
into 
finding 
institutional 
racism is no small feat. I’m 
happy that we made it here, 
and it definitely didn’t happen 
merely by inspiration.”

PROMOTING CONSE NT: SAPAC THE DIAG

Students interact with SAPAC The Diag, an event aiming to educate the campus community on consent and healthy relationships Thursday.

MADELINE HINKLEY/Daily

LSA 
freshman 
Elizabeth 
Williamson said the setup of the 
exhibit succeeded in showcasing 
the highs and lows of the 
recovery process.
“The thing I liked most about 
the event is how the survivors 
led us on a journey through their 
recovery,” Williamson said. “The 
winding exhibit really shows 
how recovery is not a linear path 
but has many twists and turns.”
Sinko said her project was 
inspired by her time as an 
undergraduate 
student 
and 
her desire to give a voice to 
women not supported by their 
communities.
“I witnessed a lot of these 
unwanted sexual experiences, 
and the sad thing was I felt a 
lot of women weren’t being 
supported, they were more just 
being ostracized, because it’s 
not convenient to be upset about 
these things, especially when 
their perpetrators were men in 
fraternities or men in positions 
of power socially,” Sinko said.
Sinko said the Finding the 
Strength to Heal project came 
out of her dissertation study, in 
which she reached out through 
surveys to undergraduate female 
students who have survived 
sexual 
violence. 
Participants 
were recruited through both 
SAPAC and Michigan Medicine, 
so 
the 
24 
survivors 
who 
volunteered to give narrative 
interviews are undergraduate 
students 
of 
universities 
throughout southeast Michigan.
The project focused on female 
survivors, but Sinko noted she 
would like to expand it in the 
future.
“We had survivors take a 
survey online — female survivors 
only is what we focused on, just 
because we thought that being 
a woman in society, you could 
navigate the world differently, 
potentially, 
than 
any 
other 
gender, so starting with women,” 
Sinko said. “I’d love to expand 
to men or other genders in the 
future.”
The women were interviewed 
about their healing journeys, 
and 19 who volunteered to 
interview again were asked to 
take photographs of their day-
to-day lives depicting moments 
of healing and moments of 
darkness. They were also asked 
what advice they would give 
survivors in the middle of their 
healing 
processes 
and 
what 
healing means to them.
Sinko said after publishing a 
scientific article, she wanted to 
do more to make the material 
she had collected from the 
interviews 
accessible 
to 
the 
public.
“This exhibit is a product 
of 
wanting 
to 
disseminate 
all the photos, all the advice, 
all the stories, to help people 
actually use research,” Sinko 
said. “Research can kind of be 
inaccessible, so we wanted to 
make it so that students can 
actually get something out of it, 
also so that service providers 
can get something out of it to 
learn what their clients might 
be looking for in their healing 
journeys.”
Sinko said the event was 
aimed at three main audiences: 
survivors, supporters and service 
providers.
“I hope as a survivor, you can 
navigate the space and see the 
light at the end of the tunnel 
and see the journey,” Sinko 
said. “No matter if you’re stuck, 
if you feel like you’re doing 
great, — you could at least take 
something away … and maybe 
just validating your experience. 
One of my participants said, ‘Oh 
everyone says you’re not alone, 
but sometimes you have to really 
see it to believe it, and it’s hard to 
just hear that message and know 
that it’s true.’”
Social 
Work 
student 
Ori 
Benoni, a member of the event’s 
planning committee, said she 
was pleased with how the exhibit 
came together.
“I think it’s really magical and 
it really speaks to how powerful 
this subject matter really is,” 
Benoni said. “The fact that so 
many people came and are really 
touched — I think it’s really 
beautiful.”
Sinko 
said 
she 
hopes 
to 
conduct the study again with 
college-aged women who do not 
attend universities, looking for 
similarities and differences, and 
to create more exhibits in the 
future.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

A 

couple 
months 
ago, 
I had to review a 
concert taking place in 
Kerrytown that would force 
me to go through the heart of 
Ann Arbor. It started at 7 p.m., 
which, being in winter, seemed 
like the dead of night. Not 
finding anyone to accompany 
me and knowing all too well 
the dangers of walking alone 
at night, I Ubered there and 
back — about a $20 excursion. 
But I didn’t even think twice 
about it. My safety came first, 
and I had been warned too 
many times about what could 
happen so I didn’t risk it.
Instances 
like 
this 
happen all the time. Whether 
it’s splurging on an Uber, 
taking an extra 15 minutes 
to establish a plan for going 
out, 
double 
checking 
for 
pepper spray before a day in 
town — these types of time-
consuming 
and 
expensive 
situations are things girls 
deal with every day. Being a 
girl is taxing. Everything we 
have to think about before 
going out, all the preparation 
we do, all the extra time and 
money we have to spend to 
keep ourselves safe — it’s 
taxing emotionally and to our 
bank accounts.
There 
are 
the 
typical 
economic 
systems 
of 
oppression 
that 
women 
face, such as the the Glass 
Ceiling, which is the barrier 
preventing 
women 
from 
rising up in the industry and 
the economy. This leads to 
women making 80.7 cents to 
the male dollar (which is only 
the average wage — women of 
color often make much less) 
and a substantial wage gap. 
There’s also the Pink Tax, the 
fact that female consumers 
pay more just simply for being 
women. It’s been proven that 
women 
are 
charged 
more 
for products and services 
like dry cleaning, personal 
care products and vehicle 
maintenance. Tampons and 
pads are charged sales tax 
because they are considered 
“luxury 
items.” 
In 
these 

occasions, women are paying 
more than men 42 percent of 
the time, and about $1,351 per 
year in extra costs. But the 
economy isn’t even close to 
the only issue for women.
Women are forced to be 
constantly vigilant about our 
safety. Even if nothing has ever 
happened to us personally, we 
know from stories and others’ 
experiences why we need to 
be cautious. I have a friend 
who went to an all-girls high 
school, and at her graduation, 
the school gave every single 
student pink pepper spray as a 
parting gift. This reflects the 
reality of a college campus — 
or anywhere, for that matter 
— that girls need a way to 
defend themselves, and that 
they feel unsafe.

Before 
going 
out, 
I’m 
always making plans with 
friends 
to 
solidify 
who 
I’m going with and who 
I’m staying with, who I’m 
walking home with. We try 
to go in groups, hopefully 
with at least a couple guys 
we trust, but even then, we 
never fail to bring pepper 
spray. If anyone decides to 
drink, she has to watch as 
it’s being poured and handed 
to her. Frat parties can be 
more terrifying than fun as 
we try to walk the tightrope 
of hanging out with friends 
and worrying about potential 
threats to our safety.
Even for just a 10-minute 
walk home at night, I have to 
be prepared. Walking from 
Central Campus back to my 
dorm isn’t worth Ubering, 
but it’s still nerve-wracking. 
My mom once chastised me 

for having pepper spray in 
my backpack, because that’s 
not easily accessible enough. 
And she’s right. If something 
happened, I wouldn’t have 
time to rummage through 
whichever pocket it’s in and 
pull it out fast enough to 
defend myself. Now I keep 
it in my coat pocket with my 
hand wrapped around it.
These 
cautionary 
steps 
that women take every day 
don’t even cross most guys’ 
minds. 
In 
an 
experiment 
performed 
by 
social 
researcher Jackson Katz, he 
asked men and women what 
they do on a daily basis to 
protect 
themselves 
from 
sexual assault. The men’s 
response: “Nothing. I don’t 
think about it.” Women, on 
the other hand, listed more 
than 30 precautions they 
take to avoid assault and keep 
themselves safe.
Staying safe on campus 
is something that is stressed 
from the very first college 
visit. We’re told about the 
Safe 
Rides, 
“blue 
light” 
emergency telephones and 
the Division of Public Safety 
and Security. The University 
of Michigan does what it can 
to keep its students safe. But 
it can only do so much. There 
is still so much left up to girls 
to do to keep ourselves safe.
And 
you 
know 
what? 
We really shouldn’t have to 
worry about this. We should 
be able to walk home from a 
concert without pepper spray 
in our hand. We should be 
able to go out without fear 
of being raped. We should be 
able to live our lives freely 
without constant vigilance. 
But 
because 
society 
has 
deemed these goals not at the 
top of its priority list, we do 
not have the luxury of putting 
our guard down. Until we 
fix the inherent flaws in our 
economic and social systems, 
I will always Uber at night 
and carry pepper spray.

ZACK BLUMBERG | COLUMN

Europe’s far-right movements come on strong, but what next?
I

n 
the 
2015 
Polish 
parliamentary 
election, 
the far-right Law and 
Justice 
Party, 
or 
PiS, won with an 
outright 
majority 
(meaning they did 
not need to form a 
coalition to govern), 
something that had 
not been done in 
Poland 
since 
the 
fall of communism 
in 
1989. 
While 
other 
European 
far-right 
parties 
aren’t doing nearly as well, 
they are still garnering both 
votes and attention; Marine 
Le Pen of the National Rally 
finished second in France’s 
presidential election in 2017, 
the Alternative for Germany, 
or the AfD, holds 13 percent 
of the seats in the German 
Bundestag and the League, 
another far-right party, is part 
of Italy’s governing coalition. 
Unfortunately, it’s undeniable 
that this extremist movement 
is doing well. However, the 
rapid rise of this movement 
raises 
a 
critical 
question: 
Are 
European 
far-right 
parties sustainable and, if so, 
how? While the resurgence 
of 
right-wing 
extremist 
ideology in Europe is highly 
disconcerting, it is unlikely 
that 
fear-mongering 
and 
xenophobia are issues that 
stable, successful parties can 
be built upon in the long-
term.
To begin, however, it is 
important 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
flip 
side 
of 
political 
sustainability: building up a 
far-right populist party is, 
comparatively, 
quite 
easy. 
European 
far-right 
parties 
focus, first and foremost, on 
xenophobia and immigration. 
Compared to the platforms 
of more traditional parties, 
which 
are 
usually 
more 
complex and nuanced, being 
anti-immigration is simple, 
easy to explain and taps 
into anger and fear. This 
helps 
recruit 
people 
who 
feel 
disenfranchised 
and 
creates a strong voter base. 
Additionally, 
by 
virtue 
of 
being extreme and providing 
shock value, far-right parties 
receive 
news 
coverage 
disproportionately. The AfD, 
a party that was created in 
2013, 
exemplifies 
both 
of 
these phenomena. In 2017, 
only 
four 
years 
after 
its 
founding, the party claimed 

13 percent of the seats in the 
Bundestag, placing it third. 
Additionally, in the lead up 
to the election, it 
was by far the most 
discussed 
party 
on Twitter. While 
the 
AfD 
is 
only 
one 
example, 
it 
shows how rapidly 
far-right 
parties 
can grow, as well 
as how effectively 
they can dominate 
political discourse 
in the short-term.
However, in the longer 
term, many of the tactics 
utilized by far-right parties 
are 
simply 
unsustainable 
and do not lend themselves 
to 
stability, 
success 
or 
effective governance. First, 
being xenophobic and anti-
immigrant relies primarily on 
a large influx of immigrants. 
Since peaking in 2016, the 
number 
of 
immigrants 
coming to Europe has been 
declining — less than half as 
many immigrants arrived in 
2018 as in 2016. This could 
decimate the platforms of 
many of these parties, leaving 
them with little to campaign 
on as people become less 
worried about immigration. 
Additionally, 
while 
railing 
against 
immigrants 
is 
an 
effective 
way 
to 
garner 
support for the party, it does 
not translate smoothly into 
effective governance. When 
in power, a party is expected 
to work to accomplish things. 
As the Law and Justice Party 
has 
discovered, 
far-right 
tactics are highly effective 
for gaining power, but are 
less impactful when making 
policy. Being in power, PiS 
is 
under 
the 
microscope, 
and things like corruption 
scandals have lowered the 
party’s 
approval 
ratings. 
Additionally, as immigration 
rates have fallen, people have 
become less worried about 
the issue, and subsequently 
less 
enamored 
with 
the 
party’s xenophobic message. 
Realizing this, the PiS has 
shifted, choosing to target 
LGBTQ people instead. This 
shift in approach underscores 
the shaky political ground 
European 
far-right 
parties 
stand on, especially when 
thrust into the limelight. 
Additionally, 
the 
bold 
claims far-right parties tend 
to make can clash with legal 
and bureaucratic boundaries, 

forcing parties to walk back 
on 
these 
positions. 
Near 
the time of the Brexit vote 
in 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
withdrawing 
from 
the 
European 
Union 
became 
a trendy talking point for 
many populist right parties. 
Across the continent, parties 
came 
up 
with 
their 
own 
portmanteaus to promote the 
idea of leaving — a Nexit in 
the Netherlands or a Swexit 
in Sweden. However, as Brexit 
has devolved into a political 
and bureaucratic nightmare, 
bold far-right parties have 
been forced to acknowledge 
how disastrous the process 
of leaving would be. Even 
Steve Bannon, an American 
far-right nationalist who has 
worked with European far-
right parties, admitted these 
parties needed to shift toward 
reforming the EU from the 
inside. These legal clashes 
can serve to undermine the 
bombastic 
promises 
that 
drive 
far-right 
parties 
in 
the first place and sink their 
reputation.
While 
all 
these 
factors 
point 
toward 
the 
unsustainability 
of 
the 
European 
far-right 
movement, its collapse is far 
from a foregone conclusion. 
In countries like Poland, the 
lack of a strong or competent 
opposition party can allow 
the PiS to govern relatively 
unchallenged, 
even 
if 
the 
party 
itself 
becomes 
less 
popular. 
Additionally, 
and 
most 
worryingly, 
if 
far-
right 
parties 
are 
able 
to 
overcome 
bureaucratic 
barriers, they can work to 
undermine the systems that 
are 
designed 
to 
contain 
them, as PiS has somewhat 
successfully 
attempted 
to 
do by undermining Poland’s 
court system.
While 
Europe’s 
most 
recent 
far-right 
movement 
has grown rapidly, that’s to 
be expected, thanks to the 
nature of the movement’s 
parties. The real test for 
these parties, however, is how 
they fare going forward as 
political and social climates 
change. Future success is far 
from certain, and there are 
many factors that threaten 
their ability to succeed in the 
future.

O

n May 17, 2017, Robert 
Mueller 
became 
a 
bloodhound. 
Deputy 
Attorney 
General 
Rod 
Rosenstein 
authorized 
a federal investigation into 
the 
Russian 
government’s 
interference 
in 
the 
2016 
presidential election, and, in 
particular, 
the 
treasonous 
possibility 
of 
coordination 
between 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
campaign 
and 
Moscow. Mueller, a former 
director of the FBI, was tapped 
by Rosenstein to serve as the 
investigation’s special counsel. 
It was also around this time 
that I bought a T-shirt. Riffing 
off 
the 
Milwaukee-based 
Miller 
Brewing 
Company’s 
logo and tagline, the shirt was 
cleverly imprinted with the 
phrase “It’s Mueller Time.” 
The shirt didn’t fit as well as 
I had hoped — you get what 
you pay for, I guess — but that 
wasn’t really the point. Who 
cares if it sits in a cardboard 
box in a dusty basement for 
20 years? I’d still be able to 
give my kids a souvenir from 
the time a detested president 
was found guilty of treason, 
impeached, 
removed 
from 
office and maybe even jailed. 
It’d be a piece of history.
I realize now I was counting 
my 
chickens 
before 
they 
hatched, and maybe even being 
a bad American. Like many 
other Democrats, I had hoped 
(and expected) the Mueller 
investigation would end with 
a resounding condemnation 
of Trump. Next would be the 
vindicating CNN coverage of 
the Senate’s first conviction 
of 
a 
U.S. 
president 
on 
impeachment charges, and — if 
we were really lucky — a Mike 
Pence no-pardon miracle, all 
culminating with the image 
of our disgraced buffoon-in-
chief in an orange jumpsuit in 
Alcatraz on the cover of Time 
magazine. As sweet as that 
would have been, it doesn’t 
look like it’s going to happen. 
What’s more, I was wrong to 
want it in the first place. Even 

if I, like many Americans, had 
suspicions of Trump-Moscow 
collusion, how could a good 
American want it to be true? 
If Mueller’s report were to 
confirm these suspicions, of 
course, that’d be one thing — 
but to have actively rooted for 
our president to be revealed a 
traitor?
On 
March 
22, 
2019 
— 
nearly two years after the 
investigation began — Mueller’s 

office submitted its findings 
to Attorney General William 
Barr. Two days later, Barr 
penned a four-page summary 
of Mueller’s findings in a letter 
addressed to Congress. Per 
Barr’s 
summary, 
Mueller’s 
team did uncover evidence 
of Russian interference in 
the election, but the special 
counsel reportedly found no 
coordination 
between 
the 
Trump campaign and Moscow 
during the 2016 election race. 
If Barr’s summary is a faithful 
representation 
of 
Mueller’s 
findings, then I — and many 
Americans — owe our president 
an apology for our premature 
mischaracterizations. It must 
be 
acknowledged, 
however, 
that 
Mueller’s 
full 
report 
is nearly 400 pages; Barr’s 
submission to Congress was 
only four pages long. What’s 
more, on April 3, The New 
York Times reported members 
of Mueller’s team believe Barr 
“failed to adequately portray 
the findings of their inquiry,” 
and that the findings “were 
more troubling for President 
Trump 
than 
Mr. 
Barr 

indicated.”
To be fair to Barr, it is unclear 
what that really means. I doubt 
Barr grossly misrepresented 
the Mueller report, but given 
the investigators’ commentary, 
it shouldn’t be controversial to 
question whether Barr’s letter 
accounted for the full scope 
and nuance of Mueller’s team’s 
findings. It is responsible and 
fitting that, on April 9, Barr 
reiterated he would provide 
a redacted version of the 
Mueller report to Congress by 
mid-April at the latest. While 
a censored copy of the Mueller 
report is better than a four-
page sketch, Congress — which 
has the power to impeach and 
convict a president — ought 
to have access to the unedited 
original. Even Rudy Giuliani, 
Trump’s personal lawyer and 
vehement critic of the Mueller 
investigation, has called for 
full disclosure of the report to 
Congress.
Demanding that Congress 
see the unredacted version 
of the Mueller report isn’t 
just about being a resentful 
Democrat. Republicans and 
Trump 
supporters 
should 
be overwhelmingly in favor 
of this, too. They’ve been 
saying all along that the left’s 
accusations of collusion and 
obstruction 
of 
justice 
by 
the president are hogwash. 
And perhaps they’re right. 
Regardless, 
if 
they 
truly 
believe this, then the prospect 
of releasing an unredacted 
report to Congress ought to be 
seen as a golden opportunity 
to clear Trump’s name — and 
a satisfying chance to clamp 
the two-year-long Democratic 
screeching.
Only 
then, 
for 
better 
or worse, can we put this 
argument to rest and find other 
things to fight about. Until at 
least next week, however, we 
can’t responsibly say whether 
or not it’s still Mueller time.

Is it still Mueller time?

I don’t typically keep a 
running Best Picture tally 
throughout the year, but I 
will be quite disappointed 
if “Transit” does not get at 
least 
a 
nomination 
in 
Feb. 
of 
2020. 
Taking 
place in modern France, 
“Transit” 
superimposes 
a Nazi occupation on a 
contemporary 
setting 
and follows the efforts 
Georg (Franz Rogowski, 
“Victoria”) 
makes 
to 
escape. “Transit” takes its 
title in part from the extra 
documents required when 
migrating internationally 
with 
stops 
in 
other 
countries. 
They 
are 
a 
coveted 
commodity 
in 
the film; it is much more 
difficult to secure transits 
than it is to secure a 
destination 
visa. 
After 
serendipitously stumbling 
upon an opportunity to 
assume a dead man’s identity, 
Georg’s shot at freedom seems 
straightforward: All he must 
obtain are transits. His journey 
is quickly complicated by a 
widow and desperate child, 
a heartbreaking love triangle 
and a woman with two dogs.
Georg’s 
epic 
journey 
is 
important. Adapted from a 
1944 novel by Anna Seghers, 
the film retains a novel-like 
narrative quality with third-
person voice over narration 
and 
intentional 
re-use 
of 
certain locations throughout. 
Director 
Christian 
Petzold 
(“Phoenix”) also wrote the 
adaptation of Seghers novel. 

Petzold’s screenplay retains 
the 
timeless 
emotions 
of 
displacement 
and 
remains 
culturally relevant despite the 
anachronistic 
socio-political 
setting.
“Transit” 
investigates 
freedom, and what it means 
to be faithful to oneself. I 

empathize 
wholeheartedly 
with Georg, taking shallow 
breaths while sitting on the 
edge of my seat. My heart ached 
with his profound loneliness. 
Palpable 
uncertainty 
calls 
attention to the truth, always 
hidden just out of view from the 
viewer or from the characters 
themselves. The film looks 
into the nature of “home” as 
defined 
by 
people, 
places, 
and safety. Georg’s fate is left 
to the viewer’s imagination, 
a 
poignant 
reflection 
on 
existence in a transient state.
Visually, 
cinematographer 
Hans Fromm (“Yella”) takes 
advantage of the widescreen 

format 
with 
gorgeous, 
expansive shots of pastoral 
French 
landscapes 
seen 
from a speeding train. Other 
train-shots 
are 
composed 
like a still-life painting: Two 
men in a stark white room 
accompanied only by cheese 
and paper. The tensely calm 
beauty of Marseille is 
rendered with clarity 
throughout the film, 
making 
the 
final 
moments doubly gut-
wrenching.
“Transit” 
reminds 
us 
the 
costs 
of 
compassion, 
the 
double-edged 
sword 
of shameful silence, 
and 
the 
existential 
weight of solitude. One 
particularly 
literary 
line, “ports are places 
where 
stories 
are 
told,” offers a neat 
summary of the film 
and 
its 
characters. 
“Transit” sees people 
converging in unlikely 
circumstances; 
each 
day some stories are told as 
other stories are being written.
While I haven’t read Segher’s 
novel, 
“Transit” 
retains 
a 
literary quality and cadence. 
Embracing 
film’s 
unique 
beauties without abandoning 
literature’s 
nuanced 
sentimentality, Petzold holds 
onto the gentleness. Opening 
the door for political questions 
and rumination on identity 
and the concept of home, 
the instant classic does not 
sacrifice immediacy. I intend 
to read the original book soon, 
and I’ll certainly be adding 
“Transit” to my repertoire of 
favorites.

Faithful ‘Transit’ is stellar

FILM REVIEW

ROSS ORGIEFSKY
Daily Arts Writer

Transit

Michigan Theater

Schramm Film

Between 
adolescence 
and 
adulthood, 
there’s 
a 
hazy, 
underappreciated threshold. Your early twenties are fast and 
ruthless, messy as your fight for control ends in the merciless 
reality of independence. Friendships end, love is lost and you fail 
to recognize yourself as the people you surround yourself with 
change. A sense of respite only creeps up in bursts of confidence 
and assurance during this period of fear, unconventionality and 
uncertainty as your identity prevails in all the ways you wouldn’t 
expect it to.
This is the story of Khalid’s career. His success with debut 
album American Teen won over pop culture when he had barely 
graduated high school. In his lovely, leathery voice, he 
conveyed the trials and triumphs of high school without 
sparing a single detail. From tales of booze-infused 
nights that went too far to heartaches that went too 
deep, his songs reached fans with and without driver’s 
licenses alike. It was an album that fit a distinct, special 
experience but was contained within a specific period 
of time — references to cell phone pictures, car ride 
apps and GPS navigation painted the scene that enabled 
or crushed the connections Khalid made with other 
people. It was a loneliness that only made sense if it was 
a loneliness that you experienced, and this specificity 
made it such a hallmark to teen music.

It’s been two years since, and our American teen has grown. 
His life has extended beyond the membrane of a high school 
existence into one of fame and independence. This proved to 
influence his sophomore album Free Spirit, as it echoes the 
sentiment that the teenage struggle of finding yourself never 
truly ends, regardless of a contextual shift into early adulthood. 
He puts it simply in an interview with Billboard saying, “this 
album is the culmination of all of the growth and experiences I 
have gathered over the past two remarkable years.”
In Free Spirit, these stories are carried by ’80s synths and 
sticky, euphoric grooves. It’s a background you can move 
to, but with a lot more variety this time around; the sound is 
effortlessly R&B with glimmers of classic rock and a surprisingly 
gorgeous guest appearance by John Mayer on guitar. The raw 
elements that made American Teen so memorable remain in tact, 

though they’ve matured. Rather than bemoaning the end of a 
relationship, he reflects on the nature of its failure in title track 
“Free Spirit,” crooning, “I’ve been lovin’ more, livin’ less / Off of 
highs and lows, so obsessed / Couldn’t get nothing / But we’re 
never runnin’ out.” Through these lines he marks his growth, 
eschewing any trepidation of judgement for his experiences. 
Similarly, Khalid explores aspects of early adulthood in 
themes we gloss over. With the image of party culture so 
ingrained in the college-aged experience, we neglect the 
vulnerability and escapism that accompany it. Khalid follows 
just this in “Paradise,” as he details getting high to cope with 
not “liking watchin’ your mama cry / You say you’d rather die / 
She says you’re wastin’ your life.” It’s anxiety-inducing, fearful 
and a bit nihilistic, but he follows this immediately with hopeful 
proclamations in “Hundred.” He explores the theme in every 
sense from having “a hundred friends,” experiencing 
a feeling for “a hundred days” and having “a hundred 
things to do,” but ensures us that it is all worth it when 
you keep it “a hundred” and “dust yourself off.” Other 
highlights include “Twenty One,” a song that’s exactly 
what you’d expect it to be about, and the funky love 
anthem “Outta my Head,” featuring the addictive bass 
stylings of John Mayer.
Overall, Free Spirit proves to be the perfect, timeless 
backdrop to early twenties and the slew of emotions 
that accompany it. In unwavering confidence, Khalid 
deftly conveys the insecurity and uncertainty that goes 
into discovering yourself and trusting your gut.

Khalid’s ‘Free Spirit’ marks his artistic maturity

ALBUM REVIEW

DIANA YASSIN
Daily Arts Writer

Art has shown time and 
time again that it cannot 
only serve as a voice to the 
speechless, but also as a form 
of healing for the broken. The 
Sexual 
Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness 
Center 
(SAPAC) 
recognizes 
this, 
and 
through 
their 
event, 
“rEVOLUTION: 
Making Art for 
Change,” 
they 
hope to not only 
bring 
attention 
to local artists, 
but 
also 
show 
the 
power 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
art of all mediums.
Hosted 
by 
SAPAC’s Survivor 
Empowerment 
and Ally Support 
(SEAS) 
team, 
“rEVOLUTION” 
is an annual event 
hosted in Rackham Graduate 
School that showcases the 
artwork of both survivors 
and allies in the community. 
The 
artwork 
represents 
a 
variety of subject matters. In 
an interview with The Daily, 
LSA junior Jessica Hobbs and 
LSA sophomore Matt Weiner 
talked about their experience 
organizing the event. Founded 
in 2006, the event focuses on 
promoting “art as a healing 
process and sharing the stories 
of survivors in a way that’s 
more digestible and even more 
intense 
emotionally,” 
said 
Hobbs, the organizer of this 

year’s “rEV.”
The event showcases a range 
of artistic styles and pieces, 
from 
three-dimensional 
hanging pieces, visual art of 
all shapes and sizes, a few 
poetry pieces, dance, audio-
video presentations and much 
more. “It’s structure mostly 
like a gallery event, but we do 

have a mini-schedule for the 
films and dance presentation,” 
Hobbs said.
The event has around forty 
different pieces on display, 
which Weiner says is “enough 
to show, but not too many as 
to be overwhelming. We want 
everyone to be able to see 
everything.”
The 
pieces 
touch 
on 
a 
variety of subject matters — 
some lighthearted, and some 
extremely personal — and the 
gallery welcomes that. They 
aim to create an environment 
for all types of art. Weiner 
discussed 
the 
selection 

process, commenting on how 
“There aren’t any specific 
requirements (for an art piece), 
per say … we’re just hoping to 
allow artists to have a space 
(for their art) to grow and heal 
from their experiences rather 
than make arguments.”
The two emphasized the 
importance of the role of art in 
the organization, 
and 
why 
they 
believe expression 
through art can 
be 
an 
integral 
component 
in 
healing 
and 
empowering 
survivors. 
“It’s 
a 
really 
easy 
way 
for 
people 
to connect with 
something 
that 
isn’t 
necessarily 
a news headline 
of 
a 
political 
topic. Using art 
as 
a 
medium 
allows people to 
interface 
with 
their 
emotions 
more 
readily 
than, say, interacting with a 
headline,” Hobbs stated.
And more so, the experience 
can be just as important for 
the observer as well as the 
artist. Weiner discussed how, 
“It’s a two-fold experience. 
It can be hard to verbalize 
exactly what you’re thinking 
on the artist’s side, however 
on the viewer’s side, the art 
can be very approachable and 
digestible.” Gallery-goers may 
resonate with a piece of visual 
art and relate to the emotions 
conveyed through it more so 
than they would have with, 
say, a piece of poetry.

Darlingside has always been a bright spot on the face of modern folk 
music. Starting out as a five-piece rock band out of Boston, Mass., the 
group narrowed down to four members and grew their sound into the 
stunning mix of influences and instrumentation that we hear today. 
Composed of multi-instrumentalists Auyon Mukharji, Don Mitchell, 
Dave Senft and Harris Paseltiner, the band has found a niche in the 
folk music scene, although their work covers a broad array of musical 
references and motifs. From their first studio record Pilot Machines, 
released in 2012, the group has never been easy to pin down, and this 
is the magic of their approach. They traverse sounds that stem from 
traditional folk to electronic experimentation with ease, building 
a colorful base from which they spin complex stories. Now touring 
their 2018 album Extralife and a recently-released EP, Darlingside 
has leaned into their multifaceted sound to create something new for 
the future.
Extralife itself is a magnum opus for the group, a response both to 
the times we live in and the realities of Trump-era America through 
an ornate lens. Yet, making a pseudo-protest album was not always the 
intention of Darlingside during the writing and recording process. I 
spoke to band member Auyon Mukharji about this process and much 
more in an interview this month, ahead of their performance this 
weekend at Ann Arbor’s historic folk venue The Ark. “We don’t do a 
lot of sort of like meta, big picture planning before we write a record,” 
Mukharji explained in a phone call with The Daily, “It’s more of a 
brain dump … for Extralife, at least, how we kind of evolved was to 
everyone getting in on ground level.”
“A person might come in with a lyric, or with a tune, and then 
everyone would have their favorite parts and work on them a little bit 

and then it would be all ripped apart as a group,” Mukharji elaborated, 
“It’s a very iterative process, so what we end up coming up with 
versus the end drafts of those lyrics is the result of our headspace.” 
On the origins of the album, the violinist explained that they came 
from many places, some harder to divine than others: “We come 
from a relatively similar place, we are very close friends and we’ve 

lived out a van for so many years together,” Mukharji said. “There 
are conversations we have, and concerns, and a lot of this was in the 
lead-up to the 2016 election, so we didn’t have a sort of overarching 
idea of what we wanted the record to be more than (the fact that) this 
is what came out of our heads.”
In addition to Extralife, Darlingside released a new EP in February 
titled Look Up and Fly Away, a combination of songs leftover from 
the album’s writing process and some that had been around for 
a while. Either way, the collection of six songs has a significantly 
more uplifting tone than Extralife, serving as the yin to its yang in 

a complementary duo. “Our record-writing process, in the gross 
inefficiency of it, is that we start with 30 or so song ideas that we 
have to whittle down to 12,” Mukharji laughed. “Then we do a little 
bit of recording of all of them and then we’ll cut it down to 25,” he 
continued, “then they’re around half-finished, so we end up with 
bits and pieces of, kind of Frankensteined songs that are in different 
levels of disrepair.”
But this doesn’t mean that everything included on the EP was 
necessarily from Extralife, or that any song has a truly cemented 
beginning in time. “So the first song ideas, some of the freshest 
musical ideas, well some of the songs that made it on Extralife the 
album had been kicking around for about a decade, from a while 
back, some of them were ideas that came to us during the writing 
process,” Mukharji explained. “So the (songs on the) EP are from a 
similar variety, right, they’re a mix and match of different things that 
we ended up playing with.”
“In the wake of press stuff and Spotify, we need to have a steadier 
stream of music, and so not limiting ourselves to a full-length album 
is something that we’re (used to),” he continued. “We enjoyed that 
process with the last album we put out, after we released (our 2015 
album) Birds Say, then we put out an EP called Whippoorwill, and it 
went great, so we thought we’d try the same trick!” This approach has 
worked well for Darlingside: In addition to providing more material 
for excited fans, they are able to integrate new music into their tour 
as they plan each performance. It’s a process that starts with the 
highly-produced music they create in the studio and boils down to 
a poignantly bare setup of the four around a microphone, weaving 
together their respective voices and instruments in a sea of sound.

Hayes is back with the release of his 
new single, “Heartbreak.” Hayes 
released the tune in January as a 
preview of his new album, Closer 
to You, and in February announced 
the tour he’s about to embark on 
later this month.
Since kicking off his music 
career in his late teens, Hayes has 
created a name for himself in the 
country music sphere with over 40 
award nominations and 
wins, including a CMA 
for New Artist of the Year. 
While he realizes most 
listeners adore the teenage 
love songs of his previous 
albums, Hayes is excited 
for fans to hear Closer to 
You, since, unlike any of his 
albums in the past, it comes 
from a more personal, 
sacred space. “I’ve probably 
worked for three or four 
years 
on 
this 
album, 
writing hundreds of songs. 
A lot of stuff was written 
to try to be like what I thought 
(the industry) wanted,” said Hayes 
in a phone interview with The 
Daily. “I scrapped everything at 
the beginning of 2018 and decided 
that I was going to make a record 
for myself. It sounds selfish and it 
sounds stupid, but actually that’s 
kind of the idea. You’re supposed 
to do that. As an artist, you’re 
supposed to start there because you 
know what’s on your heart, what’s 
important to you, what you write 
about, your experiences.”
Although diving into a new 
realm of songwriting was new 
to Hayes, he believes taking this 
album in a new direction has helped 
the process feel more worthwhile 
and fulfilling. “The whole project 
for me is about shedding weight 
and moving on,” Hayes explained, 
“For me, it’s one hundred percent 
the most transparent for sure, and 
it’s the most I’ve ever put of myself 
into music. I needed it. I wrote these 
songs because I needed to write 
these songs, not because I felt like 

I had to, and that’s a big switch. For 
several years I wrote a lot of stuff I 
thought I was supposed to, and had 
to, and now this record is just all full 
of stuff that I just wrote because I 
needed to write it, I need to sing it.”
Hayes gave fans a taste of his new 
style with his newly released single 
“Heartbreak,” which is one of the 
standout songs to be featured on his 
new album. “(‘Heartbreak’) started 
as a journal entry on a trip that I 
took by myself,” he recalled, “(I 
realized) this album doesn’t really 
have a love song, but (I wanted) for 
there to be one because I feel like 

(it was important) to write to my 
future better half and just saying, 
‘I’m going through a lot to get to you, 
but I know that it’ll be worth it.’”
With 
nearly 
three 
million 
streams on Spotify, it’s safe to say 
“Heartbreak” has already been 
well-received by fans. “I love the 
optimism of it, I love the mystery 
of it,” Hayes said. “I think it’s 
something I’ve wanted to write for 
a long time and just never really 
was in the headspace to do it. It’s 
just different in the fact that I didn’t 
really feel I had to ask for permission 
to write (‘Heartbreak’) or anything 
else on this album. I think this is 
completely unfiltered.”
Although 
“Heartbreak” 
has 
already given us a glimpse into 
what the new album will sound like, 
Hayes said he will be playing his 
unreleased songs on the tour so fans 
can hear his new music for the first 
time at the shows. For the musician, 
releasing his music live is just an 
introduction for the music that’s 
coming. “We’ve been on the road 

this entire time, we’ve been doing 
shows, but we haven’t been able to 
stop and build a proper experience. 
And now we get to do that,” Hayes 
explained. “This is all of my inner 
child happiness (about) things 
happening at once. Just getting to 
build the show, start from scratch, 
convey a message. I’ve been waiting 
to do this for so long. We’ve played 
shows, but we haven’t been on the 
road like this in a while, and this 
is where my heart’s probably the 
happiest.”
During the planning stages 
of the tour, Hayes drew a lot 
of his inspiration from 
other artists and how 
they’ve approached their 
performances. 
“I 
love 
studying anything that I 
like. I love to figure out why 
I like it, what I like about it, 
what makes it so, and how it 
was made. I love knowing 
the behind the scenes stuff 
about records and stuff. 
I just love watching live 
concerts and really trying to 
understand it and trying to 
get behind the curtain and 
figure out how it works and 
how those things happen,” he said.
But 
his 
biggest 
source 
of 
insight are his own emotions and 
experiences. “I think the time away 
really made me hone in on what I 
love, what I love to feel and what I 
want everybody to feel when they 
leave the show,” Hayes described. 
“I think this will be the first show 
where we get to know each other 
and break down more walls than 
we have before. I’m really excited 
about it.”
Hayes will be performing at the 
Royal Oak Music Theatre on April 
27th. After years of preparing this 
album and refining his sound as an 
artist, Hayes is excited to get back 
on the road and share what he’s 
been working on. “A lot of time has 
elapsed now (and that) allows me to 
kind of hit the reset button, which 
is a scary thing to do but also an 
awesome thing to get to do. I think 
the thing that’s giving the fire to 
this tour is that it’s a restart. Not a 
relaunch necessarily, but it’s a brand 
new day in a lot of ways.”

MUSIC INTERVIEW

KAITLYN FOX
For the Daily

When I’m searching for 
effortless entertainment, I 
often turn to my hometown’s 
Facebook 
group. 
I 
can’t 
help 
but 
feel 
like 
I’m 
scrolling through satire, an 
Onion-esque 
portrayal 
of 
affluent white people with 
nothing better to do than 
complain about potholes and 
playgrounds. Often, I wish 
that I could insert 
myself 
into 
their 
lives, to see where 
these woes originate, 
and why these people 
are 
so 
petty 
and 
angry 
and 
annoyed 
with 
the 
world. 
Julie 
Langsdorf’s 
debut novel, “White 
Elephant,” gives you 
the opportunity to do 
just that.
Willard 
Park 
is 
your 
typical 
upper-
middle class suburb. 
It 
has 
tree-lined 
streets, 
Halloween 
parades, 
a 
quaint local café that all 
the neighbors flock to and a 
culture of forced politeness 
used to conceal rage and 
envy. The titular “White 
Elephant” is a gaudy mansion 
built by newcomer Nick Cox, 
a real estate developer who 
has big dreams for the town 
and, thus, some big enemies.
Langsdorf 
perfectly 
captures 
the 
contrived 
nature 
of 
a 
“neighborly” 
suburb, weaving in and out 
through 
her 
characters’ 
own 
thoughts 
and, 
more 
importantly, 
how 
others 
think of them. There is a whiff 
of dramatic irony involved, 
as readers gradually figure 
out the book’s conflicts and 

controversies — the affairs, 
the fires and the mutilated 
trees — way before the people 
they’re reading about.
The most satisfying tactic 
that 
Langsdorf 
exercises 
throughout the book is the 
constant switching between 
the thoughts and troubles of 
both the tweens and adults 
of the book. Spoiler alert: 
They’re 
pretty 
much 
the 
same. Does that boy like me? 
Do I like him? Should I like 
him? Why doesn’t anybody 

like 
me? 
Why 
doesn’t 
anybody 
understand 
me? 
What seems like a peak into 
a 12-year-old’s diary is really 
an examination about how 
those feelings never really go 
away, and how in adult life 
they may lead to much more 
dire consequences.
Given the title, I was led 
to believe that this ominous 
“White Elephant” would be 
a more central character in 
the novel, and it certainly 
was in the end. Yet as I 
discovered 
early 
in 
the 
novel, the “elephant in the 
room” not a physical one, 
but rather the secrets that 
these residents are keeping 
from one another. That does 
not mean that this is a gossip 
novel, 
though. 
Langsdorf 

crafts a novel that’s part-
mystery, part-comedy and 
part-drama, all wrapped up 
in beautiful mix of humor 
and tension.
That’s not to say this 
book 
works 
on 
universal 
experiences, 
though. 
Langsdorf’s book is most 
accessible 
to 
the 
exact 
people 
she 
is 
writing 
about: 
Sexually-repressed 
suburbia-dwellers 
with 
the time and money to care 
about 
trees 
and 
hosting 
guests. 
Langsdorf’s 
characters don’t have 
too many problems — 
an overbearing mother 
here, a bratty daughter 
there — but the way 
they deal with these 
first-world issues is 
too chaotic to pass up.
The 
trials 
and 
tumults of suburbia 
is 
never 
the 
most 
interesting 
topic 
to 
examine; growing up in 
suburban New Jersey, 
this is something I 
fully understand. Yet the 
suburbs are an incredible 
anthropological study, one 
that musicians, filmmakers 
and 
novelists 
alike 
have 
recognized 
and 
taken 
advantage of. Everything has 
an aside: Financial stability 
(but too much money makes 
you an outcast), mothers and 
fathers who are still together 
(but 
their 
lackluster 
sex 
drive is driving them apart), 
the ultimate neighborhood 
experience (but that comes 
with 
pettiness 
and 
town 
halls). It is pathetic, it is 
discouraging, it is absolutely 
delicious. 
Through 
Langsdorf’s words, one can’t 
help but willfully crawl back 
into the deranged suburb 
that they came from.

White Elephant

Ecco

Mar. 26, 2019

In modern times, it’s easy 
to get so caught up in the 
superficiality of your social 
media feed and miss the 
intricacies of other people’s 
lifestyles. That’s where “Wife 
Swap” comes in. One 
spin-off (“Celebrity 
Wife 
Swap”) 
and 
a 
couple 
of 
cancellations 
later, 
“Wife Swap” finally 
makes its return to 
network television — 
this time boasting a 
more progressive air. 
Despite 
variances 
to 
the 
classic 
formula of swapping 
only 
heterosexual 
couples, 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
show 
remains 
the 
same: Two different 
families 
swap 
a 
parent for two weeks 
and see how their 
parenting 
styles 
hold 
up 
in 
other 
households.
The pilot episode 
features 
a 
swap 
between 
a 
stay-
at-home 
mom, 
Virginia, 
and 
a 
stay-at-home 
dad, 
Bo. In classic “Wife Swap” 
fashion, the two families are 
complete opposites. Virginia 
is portrayed as a helicopter 
mom who homeschools her 
repressed kids and (for some 
reason) 
takes 
care 
of 
10 
puppies, while Bo is the fun-
loving dad who lets his kids 
roam free and eat processed 
junk food all day. Although 
they were both stay-at-home 
parents, Bo was definitely 
more entertaining to watch, 
as he was teaching the kids 
to have fun while Virginia 
just took away the kids’ video 
games and cringed when they 

ate chicken nuggets.
At the end of each episode, 
the 
parents 
reunite 
and 
deliberate on what each family 
needs to change in their 
household. This segment is an 
awkward attempt to extract 
the last strains of drama 
the episode can offer whilst 
finding a “middle ground” 

between the two families. 
Throughout 
the 
entire 
episode, 
Virginia 
nagged 
about how Bo’s family needed 
to change their dietary habits, 
but she suddenly reveals in 
this conference portion that 
she is such an aggressive 
health advocate because she 
needed to give up a kidney 
for her child. This confession 
comes way out of left field and 
should have been revealed 
much earlier in the episode, 
particularly 
when 
Virginia 
and Bo’s wife Christie were 
bickering about how they felt 
“mommy-shamed.”
For the pilot episode of a 
rebooted show, the storyline 

could have used a more drastic 
change to prove why this 
version of “Wife Swap” should 
stay on the air. At the episode’s 
conclusion, 
audiences 
were 
given a trailer of the season 
to come. And with previews 
that include a vlogger family, 
a same-sex family, a sexist 
husband and many more of the 
show’s 
trademark 
cartoonish 
caricatures, 
one 
cannot 
help 
but 
wonder 
why 
they 
decided 
to 
commence 
the 
reboot 
with 
an 
episode as bland 
as the one that 
aired. 
There 
weren’t many “oh 
snap” 
moments, 
which is a crucial 
component 
every 
good 
reality 
TV 
show 
needs 
to 
capture 
its 
audience. If you’ve 
ever 
watched 
“The Bachelor” or 
any 
installment 
of 
the 
“Real 
Housewives,” you 
know the moments 
I’m 
referring 
to, 
and this episode 
is like “PBS NewsHour” in 
comparison.
As of right now, parents who 
are actively raising younger 
children are the only audience 
that the show targets, but 
if they expand to different 
kinds of families and raise the 
drama, they might be able to 
reach a level right below “Real 
Housewives” reality TV. It’s a 
good source of entertainment 
when there’s nothing else to 
watch, but the distinction 
between reality TV and an 
issue of “Parents” magazine 
is something they’ll need to 
work hard on earning as soon 
as possible if they don’t want 
another cancellation.

‘M’ must handle emotion in rivalries

Every Michigan fan, athlete 
and 
coach 
understands 
the 
significance of a matchup against 
Ohio State and Michigan State. 
The Wolverines’ rivalries with 
these two colleges are some of 
the most storied in collegiate 
athletics, and winning a road 
game in Columbus or East Lansing 
presents a formidable task.
But this is a task the Michigan 
softball team has been handed to 
continue its 15-game win streak 
and a challenge it will have to 
conquer in its hunt to host a 
regional site in this year’s NCAA 
Tournament — something the 
program hasn’t done since 2016. 
And it’s not just a single 
matchup away from home. First, 
the Wolverines will head to 
Columbus for a weekend series 
before traveling to East Lansing 
for 
a 
Tuesday-night 
standoff 
against the Spartans.
Though no more is needed 
to set the stage for the next four 
games, these rivalries go past the 
names of each school. 
When Michigan lines up on the 
diamond against the Buckeyes this 
Friday, coach Carol Hutchins will 
be shaking the hand of 1995 Big 
Ten Pitcher of the Year, Michigan 

great and Ohio State coach Kelly 
Kovach Schoenly.
“I’m always proud of my (former 
players) when I see them out on the 
field,” Hutchins said. “(Schoenly’s) 
done a really good job at Ohio State 
and I was watching their game last 
night seeing her in an Ohio State 
hat. I’m proud of her, proud of 
what they do.
“I told (the players), trying to 
go to Ohio State, it’s a brawl. And 
I think Ohio State on their field 
is even tougher. But we really 
try not to make, people ask who 
our rival is and all that jazz. To 
me every game counts the same, 
whether you’re playing Rutgers 
or Ohio State or Michigan State 
or Minnesota. They all count the 
same.”
Freshman 
outfielder 
Lexie 
Blair, who has yet to play in such 
an intense rivalry game, recounted 
how she and sophomore shortstop 
Natalia Rodriguez pretended to 
box one another during practice as 
if they were in a game against the 
Buckeyes. 
“I wanna see that on the field, 
I wanna see you attack them,” 
Rodriguez told her.
As for Tuesday’s competition, it 
is no secret that Michigan State is 
Hutchins’ alma mater. 
“I get to see the plaque of the 
national championship when we 

won, and right on their outfield 
fence is ‘1976 AIAW Champions,’ 
” Hutchins said as she pointed to 
an imaginary banner. “I give all 
the freshmen a history lesson. 
But I wanna win there just like I 
wanna win (against Ohio State) 
and nothing else changes.”
The history with these two 
teams and the Wolverines goes 
beyond Hutchins’ ties. Michigan’s 
most recent results against the 
Buckeyes and Spartans were 
convincing losses — by nine and 
seven runs, respectively — late 
in the Big Ten season that ended 
up dictating the course of the 
Wolverines’ postseason. And even 
though this season’s rivalry games 
are earlier in the year, it doesn’t 
undermine the importance of 
proving that the team can win on 
the road after playing 11 of the last 
15 at Alumni Field.
“You don’t wanna get your 
emotions too involved, whether 
you’re on the field or in the 
dugout,” Hutchins said. “You want 
to play with great heart and great 
intensity, but the minute you start 
getting emotional, your emotions 
are going to get in the way.”
But this is easier said than done. 
The only way to prove whether the 
players can understand this? 
If their win streak is at 19 come 
Wednesday morning.

Gators beat Wolverines, 4-3, ending eight-match winning streak

Comebacks 
in 
singles 
matches were not enough to 
stop Florida’s aggressive play 
in the Michigan women’s tennis 
team’s 
final 
non-conference 
match of the season.
On 
Thursday 
afternoon, 
No. 14 Michigan (13-5 overall, 
9-0 Big Ten) took on No. 23 
Florida (11-9 overall, 7-5 SEC) 
at the Alfred A. Ring Tennis 
Complex in Gainesville, Fla. 
The Wolverines, the top team 
in the Big Ten, were unable to 
claim the victory, losing, 4-3, 
and ending their eight-match 
win streak.
Michigan seniors Kate Fahey 

and Brienne Minor competed 
in their ninth doubles match 
together and battled Florida’s 
Victoria Emma and McCartney 
Kessler. After being down 3-0, 
they brought the match back to 
5-4. But the Gators proved to be 
too much, handing Fahey and 
Minor their first doubles loss 
together, 6-4.
Michigan’s three points came 
from singles victories from 
Fahey, Minor and sophomore 
Alyvia Jones. Fahey won a 
close first set, 6-4, against 
Ida Jarlskog and continued 
her success in the second set, 
winning 6-0. This victory gave 
Fahey her third-straight season 
with 30 wins and added to her 
outstanding 0.815 career win 

percentage and 124-28 record, 
the best in school history.
Minor won her first set 
easily by a score of 6-1 and a 
close second set, 6-4, defeating 
Emma in singles. Finally, Jones 
won 
both 
the 
first and second 
sets, 6-2, against 
Gator freshman 
Sydney Berlin.
“Brie 
and 
Kate both came 
out and played 
the 
tennis 
that 
they’re 
capable 
of,” 
said 
Michigan 
associate 
head coach Teryn Fitch. “It 
definitely gives the team a lot 

of confidence going into the 
rest of the matches even though 
we didn’t get the result we 
wanted.”
Florida’s Tsveta Dimitrova 
and Michigan freshman Anca 
Craciun 
added 
to the intensity 
of 
the 
singles 
matches. 
Craciun won the 
first 
set, 
6-2, 
but dropped the 
second, 6-2, and 
ultimately 
lost 
the deciding set, 
6-1.
Michigan 
junior 
Giulia 
Pairone faced Kessler, winning 
the first set, 6-2, and losing 
the second, 7-5. After a back-
and-forth deciding set with 
long rallies, Pairone lost the 
third set by a score of 6-4, 
which 
secured 
the 
victory 
for Florida. Michigan junior 
Chiara Lommer also played a 

close match against Florida’s 
Marlee Zein but failed to claim 
the victory, losing the first set, 
7-5, and the second, 6-1.
“We feel pretty good about 
doubles but there’s definitely 
room to improve,” Fitch said. 
“We put ourselves in a great 

position today, but, at times, it 
got pretty tough. Where we are 
as a team now is much better 
than where we were four weeks 
ago, 
and 
everybody 
really 
does believe in each other, so 
that’s going to pay off in the 
postseason.”

Senior Kate Fahey reached 30 wins for the third-straight season.

Jordan Brewer making impact

Last season, Jordan Brewer 
was playing against the likes of 
Dyersburg 
State 
and 
Wabash 
Valley 
College. 
The 
junior 
outfielder transferred from Lincoln 
Trail College, a community college 
of 1,031 people based in rural 
Robinson, Ill. — to Michigan last 
year. The expectations on paper 
would usually be low for a player 
making the jump from JUCO to 
a major Division I program, but 
coach Erik Bakich had other ideas 
in the preseason.
“A junior college player named 
Jordan Brewer can play outfield 
and infield and first base,” Bakich 
said in February. “Throws left 
handed, hits right handed, but one 
of our most explosive athletes. Just 
a very dynamic player. He’s made 
probably the most improvements of 
anyone probably from the fall until 
now so he’s going to be pushing for 
playing time as well.”
Brewer 
has 
exceeded 
expectations thus far. He leads 
the Wolverines in batting average, 
RBIs, stolen bases and is tied for 
the lead in home runs. Defensively, 
Brewer has been utilized in both 
the infield and outfield and truly 
lives up to his versatility. At 6-foot-1 

and 195 pounds, he possesses a rare 
combination of power and speed 
that makes him dangerous all over 
the field.
And Brewer hasn’t been phased 
at all by the transition from toiling 
in JUCO to the bright lights of the 
Big Ten.
“You know you dream of this 
as a little kid,” Brewer said. “This 
is just a replay of a little kid, you’re 
dreaming of this situation, of being 
in this situation. So, this is nothing 
new. JUCO only had twenty people 
and then you come out here to 1,100 
people. It’s just cool to see everyone 
out here supporting and seeing my 
family out here. It’s just awesome to 
see everyone come out.”
Brewer is leading off the 
field as well. He has focused on 
helping those in the special needs 
community. He suggested the 
teammates participate in Night 
To Shine, an event run by the Tim 
Tebow Foundation, which provides 
a prom experience for those with 
special needs around the world.
On his own, Brewer brought 
the idea to the locker room and his 
teammates agreed to participate. 
His maturity off the field helps 
bring perspective to the locker 
room. His involvement in the Ann 
Arbor community is unusual, 
especially 
for 
someone 
who 

transferred in, and it’s something 
Bakich feels his team needs to have.
“(Jordan Brewer is) so much 
more than baseball,” Bakich said. 
“This is a kid that brought the 
Night To Shine event to our team. 
He’s a guy that’s very invested in 
the community and giving back.
“That was one of the coolest 
things that our program has ever 
done and that’s something he 
brought. He brings that selflessness 
and just that great spirit out here 
every day. He’s always got a smile 
on his face.”
It’s hard to quantify just how 
much Brewer means to this team. 
His charisma and playmaking on 
the field have made the difference 
in several games this season — a 
grand slam against Manhattan, 
two 
diving 
catches 
against 
Minnesota and many more “web 
gem” plays. The way Brewer has 
embraced this team and been 
embraced makes it seem like he’s 
been here for all three years of his 
college career.
“He’s a positive life-force,” 
Bakich said. “He’s an energy-
giver. He brightens up a room, he 
brightens up a locker room, he 
brightens up a dugout, he’s just fun 
to be around.
“So yeah, his transition’s been 
good.”

In replacing Kinnel, J’Marick Woods develops beyond hitting hard 

It was his freshman year, 
Ambry Thomas thinks. His 
first spring ball. That was 
when he first saw J’Marick 
Woods take off a guy’s head.
“I was at corner. He was 
at safety,” Thomas says. “He 
came down like on a basic 
route and just took the tight 
end out.”
In 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
sentence, Thomas claps for 
emphasis.
“Crazy. From a freshman 
that just got up out of high 
school.”
There 
is, 
of 
course, 
a 
difference 
between 
being 
someone who hits hard and 
being a good football player. 
As Woods enters his junior 
season 
as 
a 
presumptive 

starter 
alongside 
Josh 
Metellus, it’s a gap those 
surrounding him think he’s 
successfully bridged.
When Woods came into 
the 
program, 
safeties 
and 
special teams coach Chris 
Partridge said, there was some 
developing to do. He was 17 
years old and had to adjust to 
college ball on both a physical 
and mental level. That means 
learning a playbook and it 
means 
developing 
in 
the 
weight room.
“He was like a baby deer 
running around,” Partridge 
said. “And he is now developed 
into a man.”
In the past, the Wolverines 
didn’t need Woods as anything 
more than a depth piece. Last 
season, Metellus and Tyree 
Kinnel 
could 
dependably 
take the bulk of snaps at the 
position — between them, the 

two missed just one game.
Metellus is back and will 
undoubtedly be a leader for 
the defense, as Partridge said 
multiple times on Thursday. 
But Kinnel has graduated, and 
that’s a void Woods will be 
expected to fill.
“I’ve seen his athleticism,” 
said 
fifth-
year 
senior 
linebacker 
Jordan Glasgow. 
“His potential, 
like, in terms 
of 
size. 
He’s 
6-(foot)-3, 210, 
205 
(pounds), 
I’m 
not 
sure. 
Fast, 
can 
hit 
harder than I’ve 
really ever seen 
anyone. He can really put his 
body out there and lay it all on 
the line.”
Woods’ game has gotten 

more refined. He’s got the 
playbook down, which means 
there’s 
time 
to 
work 
on 
technique. That seems to be 
going pretty well.
“He’s controlling his body,” 
Partridge said. “We saw it in 
December, before the bowl 
game. And he’s come into 
this spring ball 
and he’s been 
lights 
out 
to 
where he had to 
develop a little 
bit. And we’re 
excited 
about 
him. Like I said, 
he’s 
becoming 
a 
man. 
He’s 
taking 
a 
stronghold. 
He’s 
seeing 
formations. 
He’s 
taking 
coaching.”
The 
hitting, 
that’s 
still 
there. It has been since day 

one, and it’s still a defining 
characteristic. Glasgow called 
Woods 
the 
hardest 
hitter 
on the team and when told 
that, Thomas concurred, and 
put it simply. “He lay that 
wood,” the junior corner said. 
Hitting so hard in spring ball 
that the sound reverberates 
throughout 
the 
practice 
field, 
as 
Glasgow 
recalled, sets one 
hell of a tone.
“That 
gets 
everyone going,” 
Glasgow 
said. 
“... Just makes 
everyone 
stop 
and 
say, 
‘Oh, 
shit. This guy’s 
going 100 miles 
an hour.’ And that makes 
everyone else wanna do that 
as well.”
Kinnel’s departure is far 

from the only one Michigan 
will have to answer for come 
the fall. With Chase Winovich, 
Rashan 
Gary 
and 
Devin 
Bush all gone as well, the 
void Kinnel leaves is one the 
Wolverines don’t have quite as 
much time to think about.
If Woods can make it so they 
don’t have to 
think about it 
at all, that’s all 
the better.
“We 
want 
dogs. We want 
people 
that 
want 
to 
be 
here,” Thomas 
said. “We want 
people ready to 
compete. And 
when I know 
he’s beside me, or people on 
defense beside me, I know 
they’re coming to play with 
me.”

Junior safety J’Marick Woods is known for being a hard hitter but has refined his technical ability since his freshman season and will likely replace Tyree Kinnel.

He came down 
... and just took 
the tight end 
out.

Just makes 
everyone stop 
and say, “Oh, 
shit.”

Quinn Nordin, Jake Moody and the benefits of a kicking competition

Jim 
Harbaugh 
frequently 
preaches a “no job is safe” 
mentality, 
playing 
up 
competitions for starting spots, 
even at positions where that role 
is all but determined by the start 
of spring practice.
But if there’s one player 
who hasn’t really faced a true 
positional battle in his time at 
Michigan, it’s redshirt junior 
kicker Quinn Nordin. For a 
season 
and 
a 
half, 
the 
job 
was his and it 
wasn’t really a 
question.
Now, though? 
He’s locked in a 
bona fide battle 
with sophomore 
Jake Moody, a 
battle Harbaugh 
called “neck and 
neck” on April 3.
“It’s not what you want (if 
you’re Nordin),” said safeties 
and special teams coach Chris 
Partridge on Thursday. “It’s not 
what anyone asked for. But he’s 
gotten adverse situations, he 
looked it in the eyes and come 
in and he’s competed. He hasn’t 
backed down from it.”
Nordin was as hyped as a 
kicker recruit can 
be — an in-state 
kid who was the 
No. 1 player at his 
position 
in 
the 
country, a player 
that 
Harbaugh 
famously wanted 
so 
much 
that 
he slept over at 
Nordin’s house in 
an effort to secure 
his commitment.
The sleepover worked, but 
the rest hasn’t gone according to 
plan. Nordin redshirted in 2016, 
and going into 2017, the job was 
his. Crystal clear. There was no 
competition, no one else who 
even attempted a single field 
goal the entire season.

He made 19-of-24 that year 
and 
his 
inconsistency 
was 
on full display. He made a 
55-yarder in the season opener, 
but during a four-game stretch 
in October and November, he 
missed four-straight kicks and 
two extra points. It was the kind 
of performance that inspired 
an eyeroll, a declaration of 
“college kickers!” and a video of 
Harbaugh in a shouting match 
with Nordin on the sidelines — 
not one expected from a onetime 
No. 1 recruit.
In 
2018, 
the 
job 
was 
once 
again 
handed 
to him. But the 
performance only 
got worse. Nordin 
was just 11-for-16 
on field goals and 
notably 
missed 
two 
in 
a 
win 
over 
Wisconsin. 
Two weeks later, 
against 
Indiana, 
Nordin was reported out with 
an undisclosed illness. Moody 
trotted out in his place.
The rest is history. Moody 
made six kicks — a program 
record no one saw coming — 
that saved the game. Even with 
Michigan facing its two biggest 
games of the season, Nordin 
didn’t attempt another field 
goal the rest of 
the way. Moody 
took the reins 
and performed 
well 
against 
Ohio State and 
Florida.
Nordin, 
instead, sat on 
the 
sidelines, 
his 
job 
in 
jeopardy due to 
a freshman that 
— like most kickers — nobody 
had heard of going in. Nordin 
was just another kicker, albeit 
one with a prominent sleepover 
anecdote to his name.
Now, if Nordin wants his job 
back, he’ll have to truly beat 
Moody rather than coasting on 

the hype that once surrounded 
him so long ago.
“He’s 
gotta 
grow 
and 
understand that that’s what this 
world is,” Partridge said. “We 
had conversations 
about, you wanna 
kick, you’ve got 
the ability to kick 
further in your 
career and go to 
the 
NFL, 
well, 
they’re constantly 
gonna 
bring 
in 
people to compete 
and 
beat 
you 
out and this is 
how you have to 
handle it.”
It would be easy for Nordin 
and 
Moody 
to 
treat 
the 
competition 
as 
a 
zero-sum 
game — and subsequently feel 
resentment toward each other 
about it. But that’s not how 
it’s been. The two are friends, 

working 
out 
together 
and 
encouraging each other every 
step of the way.
Both 
also 
recognize 
the 
benefits of the battle, because 
ultimately, 
knowing 
that 
they truly have 
to 
earn 
their 
job makes each 
one 
better. 
According 
to 
Partridge, each 
has 
missed 
two 
or 
three 
field goals in 
practice, 
with 
Nordin hitting 
a few deeper ones, but nothing 
enough to create separation.
And for Nordin especially, 
perhaps this was just what he 
needed. Amid the uncertainty, 
he’s found a maturity that wasn’t 
present before.
“He’s just putting everything 

on himself and attacking the 
football and not really thinking 
about his leg swing as much and 
just relying on what he’s coached 
and what he does,” Partridge 
said. “He tends 
to 
overthink 
sometimes. 
I 
think 
his 
maturity 
has 
helped him not 
do that. … He’s 
really 
matured 
from 
(the 
competition) 
and handled it 
a really, really 
good way.”
In all likelihood, there won’t 
be any clarity as to the winner of 
that competition until one trots 
out on the field Aug. 31 against 
Middle Tennessee State. And 
even then, the one who does win 
will come in knowing that if he 
performs poorly, it’s his job to 

lose.
But with both Nordin and 
Moody performing well in spring 
ball — even getting a nod from 
Partridge as “two of the best 
kickers around” 
— perhaps this 
is a validation 
of 
Harbaugh’s 
philosophy. 
No 
job is safe, and 
both are better 
players because 
of it.
“They 
both 
go out there and 
compete 
every 
single day,” said 
junior 
defensive 
back 
Brad 
Hawkins. “They both go out 
there and be the best players 
that they can be for this football 
team, so they’re both doing what 
they do best. Just kicking the 
ball and competing against each 
other.”

Redshirt junior kicker Quinn Nordin is in a competition for the starting job for the first time ever, after getting benched for Jake Moody late last season.

He looked it in 
the eyes and 
come in and 
he’s competed.

You’ve got the 
ability to kick 
further in your 
career.

They both go 
out there and 
compete every 
single day.

He’s gotta grow 
and understand 
that that’s what 
this world is.
