ADMINISTRATION
Forrest to
step down
from VPof
research

Cites desire to
rejoin faculty,
work on developing
private enterprises
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily News Editor
At the Board of Regents meet-
ing Tuesday, Stephen Forrest,
vice president for research,
announced the University's com-
bined research budget for the fis-
cal year ending June 30 reached a
record $1.33 billion - a $54.7-mil-
lion increase over last year's bud-
get of $1.27 billion. Forrest also
announced his intention to leave
his current position to return to a
normal faculty position.
As in previous years, federal
funding from a variety of agen-
cies and departments makes up
the majority of the research bud-
get, contributing a combined 62
percent of the $1.33 billion. The
National Institutes of Health,
the single largest benefactor at
$509.7 million, reduced its fund-
ing by $9.3 million from last year
- but other agencies, including

the National Science Foundation,
NASA, the Air Force and the Fed-
eral Highway Administration,
more than made up that differ-
ence.
Another bright spot in the
portfolio is blossoming research
partnerships with private indus-
try, which grew 14 percent since
last year to $73 million. Although
partnerships remain a small part
of the overall portfolio, their
share has consistently grown
over the last few years and willbe
increasingly important as federal
support stagnates or declines.
According to the National Sci-
ence Foundation, the average
institution derives five percent of
its external research from indus-
try - less than the University's
eight percent from such partner-
ships.
Support for research from the
state of Michigan increased six-
fold over the past year, but still
amounts to only $3.5 million.
"The faculty are getting much
more rewarded from the culture
by working with industries," For-
rest said in an interview after the
meeting. "That's part of diversi-
fying the portfolio as research

MUG celebrates reno vations

Celebrations held
for new, 'brighter'
ground floor
of Union
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
With the smell of orange
chicken wafting through the air,
complimentary Frosties from

the Wendy's mascot and the cut-
ting of a ribbon, the Michigan
Union Grill - the dining area in
the Michigan Union's basement
- was officially opened.
Though the pomp and cir-
cumstance of a grand open-
ing took place Thursday, the
MUG was opened to the public
shortly before fall term began.
The space was renovated to cre-
ate a brighter and more inviting
area - a community space for
students as opposed to-simply a

food court.
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent for student affairs, spoke
to the crowd about the historic
importance of the MUG to the
University.
"The MUG has changed and
so have we, depending when
you hailed here," Harper said.
"There was a swimming pool on
the ground floor that was made
into the Alumni Center, that I've
only heard about, but there's a
little bit of our past here, as well

as our commitment to sustain-
ability."
Harper added that the wood
paneling from the former bowl-
ing alley in the Union was pre-
served in the area by Ahmo's-
Mediterranean Grill to be sus-
tainable and give a nod to the
University's past.
Harper also expressed
pride at the amount of student
involvement in planning the
MUG's renovation.

As the former Blimpy Burger
building sat unoccupied a block
away, the University's Board
of Regents approved the sche-
matic design for the residence
hall set to take the burger
joint's place at the body's meet-
ing Thursday in the Michigan
Union.
The Munger Graduate Resi-
dences, which will cost about
$180 million to build and is
expected to be complete in
2015, is funded mostly by a
$110-million donation from
University alum Charles Mung-
er, vice chairman of Berkshire
Hathaway. Munger funded a
similar project at Stanford Uni-
versity in 2009. The regents
announced Munger's donation
April 2013, noting that Mung-
er will work closely with the
administration in the construc-
tion process.
Part of Munger's donation is
reserved for a fellowship pro-

gram for graduate students.
Before the board approved the
design, Regent Andrea Fisch-
er Newman (R) said Munger
asked to name his $10-million
fellowship endowment the
Coleman-Munger Fellows.
Newman saidthe name reflects
Coleman's commitment to the
University.
"Mary Sue will be remem-
bered as a great part of this gift
and bringing it in, and we're
honored that he chose to name
the fellows after her," Newman
said.
In a presentation to the
board, Lee Becker of Hart-
man-Cox Architects said the
site "couldn't be better." The

Eight highlights from
the Regents meeting

Union Director 'hopeful'
Starbucks will open Nov.

- - Tn - -- 'n-!-- -

By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily Staff Reporter
1. University President Mary
Sue Coleman opened the Sep-
tember Board of Regents meet-
ing by praising the generosity
of Steven Ross' $200 million
gift and highlighting the world
record crowd at the University
of Notre Dame game, as well as
the first-ever quintuplets born
at the University Hospital.
"We've had a September unlike
anythingI believe we've ever expe-
rienced," Coleman said.
2. James Holloway, Univer-
sity vice provost for global and
engaged education, provided
regents with recent high-
lights of the University's study
abroad programs, as well as
data on the University's inter-
national student population.

"We need students to be saying
to themselves not 'I wonder if I
should go abroad.' We needour stu-
dents to be saying'I wonder when I
will study abroad,'"Holloway said.
3. Construction planning
will begin for a renovation of
the School of Education, which
was built in 1923. Tim Slottow,
the University's executive vice
president and Chief Financial
Officer, said the project is set
for completion in fall of 2015.
"This is long overdue," Slottow
said.
4. Effective Oct. 1, the Divi-
sion of Student Affairs will
be renamed the Division of
Student Life to better convey
the office's core mission when
communicating with organiza-
tions outside the University, E.
Royster Harper, Vice President

of Student Affairs, said.
"We think it will remain with us
in ourfuture efforts in respect to the
capital campaign,"Harper said.
5. The regents also
approved the sale of 51 acres
of property to NSF Interna-
tional, a non-profit organiza-
tion that verifies health and
safety standards, for $3.52
million.
6. Jerry May, the Universi-
ty's vice president of develop-
ment, provided an update to
the regents just two months
before the next capital cam-
paign is set to launch. May
said in the fiscal year preced-
ing the official launch, the
University received gifts from
129,000 donors - a University
record. A record number of
those gifts came in amounts
less than $25,000.

'U' buses will travel to Detroit starting Oct.

Friday and
Saturday transit
will conntect to A2
to Detroit Center
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
Eastern Market or Campus
Martius Park on a Saturday
morning? Soon, students will
have the option.
Beginning Oct. 5, a new Uni-
versity-sponsored shuttle transit
service will begin taking students
from Ann Arbor to the Univer-
sity's Detroit Center - with stops
at Eastern Market, the Cultural
Center, Downtown and south-
west Detroit under consideration.
The primary aim of the ser-
vice is to provide the University
community with a more efficient
option for getting to and from
Detroit, where the University has
devoted significant financial and
educational resources in recent
years in an attempt to broaden
student experiences.
The University's Detroit Cen-
ter and Semester in Detroit Pro-
gram announced that a pilot
service will be available free of

funding becomes more difficult
from funding from the federal
government - we have to broad-
en our base."
However, Forrest added he's
concerned about the effects
that federal sequestration - an
across-the-board, 5.1-percent
cut to all discretionary spend-
ing - which will be evident in
2014's research report. However,
the University is already expe-
riencing "shortfalls" in funding
because of the cuts.
"The research is about eco-
nomic growth," Forrest said.
"Innovation has long been the
source of economic power of this
country really since the post-war

charge on Fridays and Saturdays
throughout the fall semester.
Addell Austin Anderson,
the director of the University's
Detroit Center and co-director of
the MDetroit Center Connector,
said the continuation of the ser-
vice beyond the fall semester isn't
guaranteed, but she is "optimis-
tic" about securing funding for
the winter semester.
"It's all going to depend on how
successful we are to get riders,"
Anderson said. "I feel optimistic
because we have gotten a huge
outpouring of support and people
that are interested."
Funding for the project almost
entirely comes from a $45,000
grant from the Transforming
Learning for the Third Century
fund - a project of the Third
Century Initiative, a University
program to explores innovative
teaching opportunities.
Anderson also emphasized
that this project is fulfilling a
need that many University affili-
ates and Detroiters have had for a
while.
"This is something that has
been a long time coming," Ander-
son said. "There has been some
frustration that there hasn't been
an easy way to get (to and from)
campus and Detroit."

Anderson added that the ser-
vice will be beneficial to both Ann
Arbor and Detroit residents in
that both can more easily enjoy
the benefits of the two cities,
calling it a "two-way street." She
hopes the service will provide
new opportunity to "get off cam-
pus andgo see what'sgoingon" in
Detroit.
Another shuttle service to the
Dearborn area is also under con-
sideration.
The first shuttle to Detroit
will leave Ann Arbor at 8:15 a.m.
on Friday and the last shuttle
will return at 8:45 p.m. On Sat-
urday, the first shuttle will leave
Ann Arbor at 8:00 a.m., and the
final shuttle will return at 11:00
p.m. The tentative schedule was
formed based on an online survey
filled out by University students
and staff.
LSA senior Haley Sakwa, chair
ofCSG's Detroit Commission, said
the shuttle program's organizers
consulted with the commission
and the newly-reformed Detroit
Coalition in trying to gauge stu-
dent interest and determining
when there would be demand for
the service.
"You can't expect the Detroit
Center to reach out to all the stu-
dent groups (focused on Detroit)

on campus," Sakwa said. "Unless
we make it easy for the adminis-
tration to include what we have
to say, I don't think they'll be able
to include the students voices and
opinions in their decision."
Sakwa added that while the
commission has some concerns
about the funding for the pro-
gram, given that it has a limited
time grant, she is hopeful that it
will continue past the trial period
this fall.
LSA junior Michael Baroody
said the service is long overdue.
"As an institution for higher
education we have much to learn
from Detroit," Baroody said.
"For me personally, having been
involved with the campus farm in
the past, I see a huge potential for
partnerships and programs with
Detroit's urban agriculturists."
Baroody said it would help stu-
dents appreciate what the city has
to offer the University and stu-
dents.
"While there are partner-
ships with Detroit already in
place ... this will most definitely
foster a new level of interest
and appreciation for this great
American city," Baroody said.
"Having only been to Detroit
once or twice, I can't wait until
this takes effect."


era. This is very much going to
hurt our prospects in the future
being able to compete on an
international level."
Forrest, who will step down
from his current role in Janu-
ary, has served as vice president
for research since 2006. His ten-
ure has been marked by signifi-
cant growth in the University's
research budget despite econom-
ic challenges - growing from a
little more than $800 million in
2008 to $1.33 billion currently.
Forrest received his doctorate
in physics in from the Univer-
sity in 1979 and went on to work
at Bell Labs - a storied basic
research laboratory owned at the
time by AT&T - and assumed his
first teaching position at Princ-
eton University in 1992. His biog-
raphy states that he has written
around 465 journal articles and

holds 203 patents.
He will rejoin the College of
Engineering as a faculty member
while also working on growing
some of the companies he has
helped found. Forrest will also
devote time to working on his
research project - one of the
largest in the College of Engi-
neering's portfolio.
"What I'm really looking for-
ward to is being able to focus on
one set of problems, rather than
focusing on administration of
a giant University - which has
been exciting in all dimensions -
but I also had to maintain a really
excellent and robust research
program," Forrest said.
Forrest added that during his
eight years in Ann Arbor, the
University has actively worked to
engage both large and small busi-

cal process and possible solutions
to these problems. Above all else,
Snowe emphasized that the spirit
of bipartisanship would be the
key to solving the nation's myriad
issues.
"Our (political) system should
be a marketplace of ideas predi-
cated on consensus building, not a
battle of ideology," she said.
Snowe lamented Congress's
many "self-engineered and man-
ufactured crises." The downgrad-
ing of the country's credit rating
in 2011, she argued, was in part
caused by legislative inaction on
the debt and entitlement spend-
ing; this past January, as a result
of earlier failed negotiations, it
took Congress right up to the
11th hour to finally resolve the
fiscal cliff issue, that economists
warned would have had serious
consequences on the economy as
a whole.
The habit of "legislating up to
deferral and brinkmanship," as
Snowe described it, still persists,
as Congress must deal with bud-
get issues to avert a government
shutdown before Sept. 30 and
decide whether or not to raise the
debt ceiling by mid-October.
Compounding this concern
was Snowe's claim that there's
"very little institutional memory"
of how the legislative process
worked within both chambers.
According to Snowe, more than
half of the members of both the
Senate and House have fewer
than 6 years of experience, mak-
ing them only familiar with the
current climate of dysfunction
and inaction.
Snowe acknowledged that part
of the reason for the rise in par-
tisanship and polarization had to
do with shifting demographics
among the electorate, referencing
pollster Nate Silver's statistical
estimate that the number ofswing
districts in the House shrank
from 103in1992 to just 35 in 2012.
Because of this, "most elections
are predetermined before they
even occur," creating"little politi-
cal incentive to reach across the
aisle."
In addition to issues within
Congress, Snowe also cited the
MUNGER

additional student entrance and
loading dock at the back of the
complex.
The residence will have eight
floors, and the top floor will fea-
ture lounges, study spaces and a
fitness center, accompanied by a
running track. Becker said this is
his "favorite" floor since it allows
residents to interact with each
other ina common space.
After the regents approved the
design, Regent Andrew C. Rich-
net (R) said he was happy the
design represented an innovative
living space that aims to engage
graduate students from a variety
of disciplines who may not other-
wise interact.

Since the expected cost of liv-
ing inthe hall is $1,000per month,
Rackham students have asked the
regents to work to lower the price.
Rackham student Kaitlin
Flynn, vice president of Rackham
Student Government, spoke dur-
ing the public-comments section,
stressing her opposition to the
building's cost.
Flynn said graduate students,
like many undergraduates, live
on a fixed income and do not have
financial help from their parents,
making $1,000 per month an
unreasonable amount to expect
for housing.
Along with Flynn, Public

Obama administration's failure
to communicate on a consistent
basis with congressional lead-
ers as a cause of dysfunction. She
referenced how former President
Ronald Reagan and former House
Speaker Tip O'Neill would meet
every week, and despite their vast
ideological differences, under-
stood what they had to overcome
for the good of the country.
Since leaving office, Snowe has
embarked on a speaking tour to
promote her book, "Fighting for
Common Ground," and has estab-
lished Olympia's List, a political
action committee that supports
congressional candidates in both
parties who value bipartisanship
and consensus.
College campuses have been a
popular destination on Snowe's
tour because of her desire to com-
municate to young people about
the importance of public service
and what the mission of public
service is all about: to solve prob-
lems and achieve practical results.
"I don't want (students) to be
turned off by this (political) cli-
mate and I don't want them to
take their cues from this climate,"
Snowe said in an interview before
the event. "I'd rather change it."
Prior to delivering her lecture,
Snowe spent much of her day
meeting with students. She had
a question-and-answer session
with Prof. John Schwarz's pub-
lic-policy class, had lunch with
another group of Public Policy
students, and held a question and
answer session with Women and
Gender in Public Policy, a student
organization within the Ford
School.
Public Policy graduate student
Erin Sullivan, amember of WGPP,
said Snowe was very candid in
talking about her experience in
the Senate.
"She wanted the full experi-
ence, and she gave plenty of stu-
dents the opportunity to engage
with her, which is what we should
be striving for," Sullivan said.
Crucial to changing the cul-
ture of dysfunction, according
to Snowe, is involving people -
especially students - in the polit-
ical process.
"We're a representative gov-
ernment; we get the government
we demand," Snowe said before
the event. "If we value bipartisan-
ship, we will get it."
Health student Cameron Glenn,
president of the Public Health
Student Assembly, and Michael
Proppe, the Central Student Gov-
ernment president, said at the
meeting that they wished the
University took more student
input into consideration before
proposing the schematic design.
In response to the students'
comments, E. Royster Harper,
the University's vice president
for student affairs, said she hopes
the board can make the housing
more affordable. She added that
the creation of the residences is
necessary as the last graduate stu-
dent housing option constructed
was Northwood V in 1971.
Harper attended a forum host-
ed by Rackham students last week
to answer questions and concerns
that students had over the design.
At the forum, students were pri-
marily concerned with the com-

munity-livingstyle ofthe building
and its cost to future residents.
Harper told the students that
the administration has to signifi-
cantly consider Munger's vision
for the building because he was so
heavily involved in the planning
process.
"If this were 'just us' and
the funding were 'just us,' we
would have some different kinds
of options," Harper said at the
forum. "But I think when you are
in partnership ... you make some
agreements about what you're
going to offer, then we have to
honor those agreements."

"We were able to bring it out

She added that the University

the space will better allow stu-
dents to do.
"In the past you might have
done it or seen people where
they're like 'I'm just going to get

"It was dark, and the response
that we got from students was
that it felt like you were eating in

LSA senior Adam Kleven was
one of several students who
offered his input as part of the

committee's duties was assessing
which restaurants and vendors

"Ahmo's being a local business

been a great partner, and they're

important to students," he said.
Kleven said he believes that
student involvement is always
going to be an important part of
the Union.
"The Union was created by
students for students, soI believe
it's very important that they feel
like it's a place they want to be

initial warning. "He was asked to
leave the property, and if he came
back he was subject to arrest."
University Police described
Kirtikar's current living situa-
tion as transient and between
residences. Up until several
months ago, he was living in an
apartment in Ann Arbor, Pier-
sante said.
Kirtikar was arraigned Thurs-
day on four counts of financial
transaction device crimes and

one count of receiving stolen
property. His bond was set at
$100,000 cash.
Piersante said investigating
Kirtikar for theft of the devices
will probably take a couple of
weeks, during which time Uni-
versity Police will attempt to
determine the origins of the
stolen devices, if any fraudulent
charges were made on the sto-
len credit cards, to whom they
belong and what he planned to do
with all of the belongings.

"It's a little easier for the cred-
it cards because they have IDs on
them," Piersante said. "It's a little
harder for the laptops and cell-

Piersante stressed the impor-
tance for University students
to register their electronics

said it would be much easier to

UN Sec-General meets with Iran's new president

UNITED NATIONS (AP)
- Iran's foreign minister and
the U.N. Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon exchanged views
Thursday on the country's con-
troversial nuclear program
and its potential role in end-
ing the Syrian conflict, two
issues expected to dominate
next week's annual gathering
of world leaders at the United
Nations.
Mohammad Javad Zarif,
a former U.N. ambassador,
returned to U.N. headquar-
ters for the first time since he
was named foreign minister by
the country's new president,
Hasan Rouhani, who will be
making his first appearance at
the General Assembly on Tues-
day.
"I commend the efforts of the
new government in Iran in pro-
moting dialogue with the inter-
national community," Ban said.
"I'm pleased thegovernment... is

now taking some concrete steps
to fulfill the promises made by
president Rouhani during his
recent election campaign."
After years of frozen diplo-
matic relations, U.S. President
Barack Obama and Rouhani,
considered a relative moder-
ate in Iran's hard-line clerical
regime, exchanged letters after
his election. This has fueled
widespread speculation that
U.S. and Iranian officials may
meet on the sidelines of the Gen-
eral Assembly.
Avaaz, an activist organiza-
tion that uses the internet to
mobilize support for various
political issues, said it launched
a campaign this week which has
already been signed by more
than 1.1 million people calling
on the U.S. and Iranian leaders
to agree to talks at the General
Assembly. It is also running
polls in Iran to gauge opinion on
a U.S.-Iran meeting.

"This could be President
Obama's Nixon-to-China
moment that would save Syr-
ian lives - the question is
whether the two reform-
minded leaders who will soon
be mere steps away from each
other in New York will seize
it," Avaaz Campaign Director
Ian Bassin said.
Zarif hosted a lunch for
many U.N. ambassador and
Wednesday and invited the
five permanent members of the
Security Council - the U.S.,
Russia, China, Britain and
France. Several ambassadors
who attended said they did not
see U.S. Ambassador Samantha
Power and a well-informed U.N.
diplomat, speaking on condition
of anonymity because the lunch
was private, said the U.S. did not
attend.
The secretary-general told
reporters he had "a very good
meeting" with Zarif and praised

the government's release
Wednesday of 12 political pris-
oners - a move Ban said he
pushed for when he visited Iran
in August 2012.
U.N. spokesman Martin
Nesirky added that they dis-
cussed "Iran's growing coop-
eration with the international
community on a host of issues,
including the nuclear file, as
well the role Iran could play in
promoting a political solution to
the conflict in Syria."
Zarif was equally upbeat
about the meeting.
"We had a good meeting
with the secretary-general, dis-
cussed various issues of interest
to all countries including Iran
and the United Nations," the
Iranian foreign minister told
several reporters. "We attach
great importance to the role of
the United Nations and we had
a good discussion on the nuclear
issue and on other issues."

The Texas State Technical College's plan is detrimental to education
Due to budget changes within the Texas State Technical College
system, the state's 12 technical colleges will receive state fund-
ing in proportion to the future incomes of their graduates as of
September 2015. This is part of a growing trend in which the allocation
of state funding to colleges is based upon graduates' success. While other
states have appropriated college funds based on performance factors such
as degree completion and graduate career fields, the state of Texas will be
the first to directly correlate funding and graduate income. Although this
approach to funding may have limited value, it will be detrimental to educa-
tion if states continue to equate graduates' success to their salaries.

up to Mitchell Field,
crammed in an assort-
ment of vans and
cars. The field
looked ghostly

with dozens of

echoing "mine" STEEN
and "push up!"
I approached
the referees - two tall, skinny guys

captain of the co-rec B intramural
soccer team "Blurples" and stood
staring at an indiscriminate region
of space between the two of them as
they reviewed the rules. No offsides,
no slide tackling, subs go in at the
halfway line. But they didn't men-
tion the one I was most interested in.
"So,there'sarumorgoingaround,"
I said. "Is it true that goals scored by
women are worth two points?"
"Yeah, girl goals are worth
double."
"OK - just wanted to confirm."
I could have questioned them
about why that's a rule. I could have
rolled my eyes. I could have been
blatantly pissed. Instead, I skipped
off into the floodlights to tell all
my female Blurples to play offense
and to shoot as much as possible.
Because, I want to win, so if girl
points are double, then we might as
well take advantage of it, yeah?
Truth is, I wasn't mad. I realize
the rule is indisputably insulting
to women, but it's hard to com-
plain when the rule is, after all,
benefitting me.
I'm reminded of a certain soccer
game I played during my shrimpy,
self-conscious days as a sixth-grad-
er. I was on an all-female travel
team, and we played all-female
teams. Any hostility toward the
other team was typically limited to
the ever-so-passive-aggressive fail-

On Wednesday night, the Uni-
versity of Michigan's Department
of Medical Education held a memo-
rial service for the friends and
families of its anatomical donors.
These donors are individuals who
decided to give their bodies over
to the University after their death
for use in medical education, sci-
entific research and technological
development. Those in attendance
heard stories of gratitude from
medical students, doctors and engi-
neers who have all directly benefit-
ted from these donations. It was an
emotional night, with the heart
pangs of sorrow and the full body
warmth of thankfulness palpably
clear for all in attendance.
Anatomical donations have come
a long throughout the history of
medical education: from an era
when the thought of human dissec-
tion was inconceivable (and anat-
omy was learned strictly through
centuries-old texts) to the reign
of body snatchers (where admis-
sion to medical was conditional on
an applicant having an anatomi-
cal specimen) through to the pres-
ent day where a single body may be

used to educate a thousand students
throughout the course of a semester.
As a bit of historical trivia, there
was a time when medical schools
were so desperate for anatomi-
cal specimens that they would pay
top dollar for just about anything,
no questions asked. University of
Michigan Medical School alumnus
Herbert Webster Mudgett - bet-

Today the procedures for body
donation, procurement and treat-
ment are all covered in the United
States under the Uniform Anatomi-
cal Gift Act, a set of laws designed
to curb human trafficking, eliminate
the black market sale of organs and
ensure that the dignity, respect and
privacy due to such donors are held
in the highest esteem.
There is no dispute that such
donations are hugely beneficial to
nearly everybody involved. There
are statistics out there that show
students taught anatomy with
access to real anatomical speci-
mensvastly outperform those with-
out such exposure; there are lots of
studies that show how necessary it
is for doctors-in-training to work
with real anatomical donors before

treating patients; and it is undeni-
ably true that much of the progress
made in medical device design and
manufacture is due in large part to
anatomical donations made across
the world.
Arguably the only people who do
not benefit from anatomical dona-
tions are the donors themselves.
They are helping medical students,
they are helping doctors, they are
helping future patients and all at a
time when these students, doctors
and patients cannot help them. So
why do they do it?

ACCESSING GERSHWIN
MT&D spurs new
partnership

'U' opens the
Gershwin Initiative
to increase access
By MAX RADWIN
Daily FineArts Editor
"Love is Here to Stay" - and
so is the rest of George and Ira
Gershwin's musical legacy.
. The University now has
access to the papers, composi-
tional drafts and original scores
of famous Broadway and Holly-
wood musical composers George
and Ira Gershwin, thanks to a
new partnership between their
estates and the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance.
Access to those materials
will assist future musicians
- student and faculty alike -
trying to work with the scores
of George Gershwin and the
accompanying lyrics of his
brother, Ira.
"For the first time, musi-
cians are going to get the musi-
cal scores in a performable way
that reflects, as close as we can
understand, the vision of the
composer and the lyricist," said
Mark Clague, associate pro-
fessor of musicology and the
director of research at MT&D.
"Today, if you wanted to do that
with current materials, you'd
have to spend hours and hours

marking the scores, cleaning it
up, wasting rehearsal time."
The Gershwin Initiative
- which will result in new
courses, scholarly symposia and
future student performances of
the brothers' music - will cre-
ate the first-ever critical edi-
tion of their entire collection of
work.
"We have critical editions
of the works of Shakespeare
and we have the music of
Beethoven," Clague said. "But
this will be the first time ever
the music of George and Ira
Gershwin is given this kind of
rigorous scholarly treatment
that all the great music of the
European tradition has gotten.
It's American culture on a new
platform."
The critical edition will be
made up of around seven series
and between 35 and 45 volumes.
Students and faculty will have
access to the Gershwins' com-
positions, with commentary
and detailed analysis of scores
and numbers.
"To really understand what
George wanted," Clague said,
"you have to go back to those
little scraps of paper that he
wrote on when he was putting
something together."
George Gershwin, who was
a notoriously fast if not erratic
composer, died at age 38, before
he could make a lot of those

edits to his own works. In many
cases, other musical styles like
jazz, which Gershwin never
experienced firsthand, were
posthumously injected into his
music.
Yet, on the whole, changes
to the Gershwins' drafts and
scores will be marginal, Clague
said. "It's not like we're going
to discover a piece most likely,
though of course I hope to....
There's a couple missing mea-
sures, and there's a couple
measures that George actually
tried to cut out of the piece that
someone else put back in."
Clague also said there will
be an electronic mirror of the
Gershwin collection installed
in Ann Arbor's Library of Con-
gress.
Last Sunday MT&D put
together a .panel, moderated
by Clague, for those excited
about the Gershwin Initiative
announcement. A concert fea-
turing Broadway star Audra
McDonald, hosted by the Uni-
versity Musical Society, contin-
ued the celebration following
the panel.
Concerning the potential
the acquisition brings to music
scholarship within the Univer-
sity, Clague said, "There's going
to be a fresh excitement around
this music in the concert hall
and on stage that audiences are
really going to respond to."

the best comedy pilots in years.
Whereas "Dads" buys into
every stereotype in the book,
Andy Samberg's new comedy
actively works to subvert them.
"Nine-Nine" is set in a world
where there are just as many
female detectives as there are
male, where minorities aren't a
minority in the workplace and
where police captains can be of
any sexual orientation.
In the following hour, "New
Girl" continues to be one of
the funniest and sweetest
comedies on television, while
Mindy Kaling is one of the few

ever have a starring role in a

But infuriatingly, 90 minutes
earlier, we're still supposed to
be laughing when Crawford
confuses his son's Spanish wife

Perhaps even more offen-
sive than the blatant offensive-
ness is the laziness with which
"Dads" seems to have been
made. From the sets, to the
pacing, to the unbearable laugh
track, this series marks a new
low for broadcast sitcoms. FOX
has been so creatively success-
ful in the comedy department
recently that the existence of
this series is all the more puz-
zling. Let's just chalk this one
up to the law of averages and
try and pretend it never hap-

Andy Samberg
breaks out of'SNL'

Topical, quirky
humor in 'Brooklyn

By ALEC STERN
Daily Arts Writer
Over the past decade, "Sat-
urday Night Live" alums have
gone on to star in some of the
best comedies
on television. A

non, whose Fog
work on HBO's
underappreciated "Enlightened"
earned her an Emmy nomina-
tion, "SNL" 's performers have
consistently transitioned into
successful sitcom careers. Hop-
ing he can continue the trend,
Andy Samberg stars in the new
sitcom, "Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"
which arrived on FOX this week.
There must be something in
the water in the "SNL" offices
because Samberg most definitely
upholds the reputation of his
peers. "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" is
fresh, funny and surprisingly
heavy on social commentary, all
of which make it one of the must-
watch comedies of the fall.
"Nine-Nine" follows Detec-
tive Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg,
"That's My Boy") and the entire
Nine-Nine unit of police officers.
Peralta is great at his job, though
his professionalism leaves a lot
to be desired. When a new cap-
tain (Andre Braugher, "Men of a
Certain Age") joins the precinct,
their polar-opposite personali-
ties clash - jokes ensue.
In addition to Samberg being
on his A-game, the support-
ing cast is superb, which is the
mark of any truly great work-
place comedy. "The Office" was
so successful not only because

Steve Carell, John Krasinski and
Rainn Wilson were electric in
their lead roles, but because any
character could be counted on
for laughs. From Erin, to Phyl-
lis, to Creed, these characters
didn't just round out the cast -
they made "The Office" what it
was. Much like the iconic NBC
sitcom, "Nine-Nine" 's back-
ing characters, including Terry
Crews ("White Chicks"), Melissa
Fumero ("One Life to Live") and
Joe Lo Truglio ("Role Models"),
are terrific.
"Nine-Nine" is also quick to
establish its tone, finding its nar-
rative footing very quickly. The
style is fully realized, which is
one of the distinguishing char-
acteristics of a great television
pilot. The vibe, characters, story
and visuals all work seamlessly
together, much like the first
half hour of fellow FOX sitcom
"Arrested Development." While
"Nine-Nine" still has a ways to
go before reaching the soaring
heights of the cult classic, there
is so much potential that one can
only hope it will eventually make
a similar impact.
Toward the end of the pre-
miereepisode,"Nine-Nine"takes
an unexpected turn. Braugher's
straight-laced, hyper-masculine

captain reveals that the reason
it took so long for him to reach
this level in his career is because
he is gay. When he makes his
announcement, it doesn't feel
exploitive or gratuitous. It's not
so the writers can make jokes at
his expense. It's forward-think-
ing, smart and above all proves
that there is more going on than
just sight gags and physical com-
edy. It also helps that Braugher
continues to be one of TV's most
reliable actors. Last year, his
short-lived ABC drama, "Last
Resort," was regarded as one of
the best pilots of the year. It's a
title that Braugher might once
again claim, as "Brooklyn Nine-
Nine" is a very strong entry.
Hopefully, "Nine-Nine" will
be given ample time to further
explore its characters, all of
which are likeable and hilari-
ous. It's notgoingto help that the
show's lead-in is the abysmal and
offensive "Dads," but if viewers
watch the two in succession, it'll
be even easier to see just how
current and clever "Nine-Nine"
is. Creators Mike Schur and Dan
Goor (two of the masterminds
behind "Parks and Recreation")
have created a workplace with
incredible potential and so far,
we're off to a fantastic start.

Barnes Arico's new workout

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Wearing a drenched purple
workout tee, Michigan wom-
en's basketball coach Kim
Barnes Arico walked into her
office Tuesday sweating pro-
fusely. She had just completed
her 142nd straight day of work-
ing out for at least 30 minutes.
The streak began after last
season ended when Barnes
Arico and her staff had a talk
about how important physical
fitness, health and setting an
example for the players are.
"We always want to be in
great shape," Barnes Arico said.
"We always want to eat right.
We always want to take care
of ourselves. I think it's part of
our responsibility as coaches
and as staff to set the example."
To emphasize the point,
Barnes Arico and company

devised a competition set with
rules and regulations.
"It has to be 30 minutes of
cardio," Barnes Arico said. "But
if you decide to walk, because
sometimes you need to vary it
up, you have to double the time
for a walk. And if you really
want to change, you can play
tennis or basketball or volley-
ball, which we've done before
too, but that has to be about an
hour in duration."
The competition began at
the beginning of May with all
women's basketball staff mem-
bers involved. The contest's
first victim was the youngest
member of the staff, assistant
coach Joy McCorvey. Follow-
ing her, others started drop-
ping out, including assistant
coach Chester Nichols.
Now almost five months
later, just two remain - Barnes
Arico and women's basketball

director of operations, Amy
Mulligan.
While Barnes Arico, who has
run the New York City Mara-
thon, was seen as a favorite to go
the longest, Mulligan competed
somewhat as of a dark-horse
candidate to last this long.
"(She) thought 365 days was a
good number to try to achieve,"
Barnes Arico explained of Mul-
ligan, who "didn't work out
prior to this." "I said 'let's start
with three.' Then maybe six.
And then maybe nine."
Having to put in 20-hour
days during the summer with
teen camps and recruiting vis-
its in the summer, Barnes Arico
faced a dilemma: when would
she have time to work out?
"You really have to make a
commitment to being up at five
in the morning or staying up
super late to get it in," Barnes
Arico said. "It's difficult in our

profession to be able to do it.
But Amy and I have managed."
Finding time to work out
hasn't been the only issue
that Barnes Arico has had to
deal with during the streak. A
couple of times, the issue has
been dealing with inclement
weather or not having access
to a workout room. As a result,
Barnes Arico had to use cre-
ativity to get a workout in.
One such instance was the
day the team flew home after
spending 10 days in Europe.
"We left at 6:30 in the morn-
ing and we were out running
the streets of Italy," Barnes
Arico said. "We did stairs, we
did push-ups, and we did sit-
ups."
Though cardio has com-
prised the bulk of the staff's
workouts, especially for Barnes
Arico, there are some loopholes
that have allowed for Mulligan
to keep her streak going, like
golf.
"I have yet to do that," a
smiling Barnes Arico said. "But
that's what Amy seems to do on
Sundays, I don't have four open
hours in my day."
That sentiment was espe-
cially true on Wednesday with
Barnes Arico scheduled to fly
out of Ann Arbor at 7:30 a.m.
for a recruiting trip. Knowing
what was planned for the day
- recruiting non-stop until her
11p.m. flight that night - Barnes
Arico said she'd "probably be
up (Wednesday) morning at
four" to work out before arriv-
ing at the airport at 6:30 a.m.
While a winner will eventu-
ally come out from the compe-
tition, it's hard to tell who that
person will be, especially with
Mulligan's latest epiphany.
"(Amy) told me the other
day, it's no longer a competition
- it's a lifestyle," Barnes Arico
said. "So that's kind of what I
was trying to achieve and now I
feel I can never fall off because
I have to keep Amy going."

Men's tennis set
for fall season

By MATTHEW KIPNIS
For the Daily
The Michigan men's tennis
team will find out where it stands
against other top tennis pro-
grams in the nation this weekend
as it begin its 2013-14 campaign.
The Wolverines will send three
players to the UVa Ranked+1
Invitational this weekend in
Charlottesville, Va. Juniors
Alex Petrone, Justin Rossi and
Michael Zhu will all compete in
the singles draw while Petrone
and Zhu will also play in the dou-
bles bracket.
"This tournament is the
beginning of our fall match-
es, and it really helps us know
what we need to work on and
what we need to do to compete
against other top programs in
the nation," said Michigan coach
Bruce Berque.
Last year, the 22nd-ranked
Wolverines ended the season
with a disappointing upset in the
first round of the NCAA tourna-
ment, losing 4-2 to No. 42 Vir-
ginia Tech. The team, however,
returns every player but one from
last year's team, star Evan King,
that advanced to the NCAA Tour-
nament and finished tied for sec-
ond in the Big Ten, so they have
high aspirations for this season.
Rossi hopes his recent success,
finishing last season with a per-
fect 4-0 record in Big Ten action
and winning the ITA Summer
Circuit event in July by upset-
ting top-seeded Aaron Pfister of
Michigan State, can carry over

into this season.
Zhu is looking forward to the
upcoming opportunity and get-
ting the season started. Zhu and
Petrone posted a 14-11 record as
doubles partners last year. In
the year's first national singles
poll, Petrone ranked 118th in the
country, joining Junior Vlad Ste-
fen, who is ranked 82nd.
"Last year, I played in a tour-
nament similar to this and won
a couple matches so hopefully
I can have a similar outcome,"
Zhu said. "We know each oth-
ers strengths and weakness. We
have been playing together for
two years now so we really have
a good understanding on how we
play."
In order to prepare for the
tournament, Berque has been
stressing conditioning so that
the team is physically prepared
for its matches. Berque relishes
the opportunity for his players to
compete in Charlottesville this
weekend and get some matches
under their belt.
"This tournament is really
important for our players to
build some confidence," Berque
said. "Confidence is a big part of
an individual sport like tennis.
Hopefully we can execute and
compete well against these top
opponents. We will pay attention
and evaluate what needs to be
worked on based on their play."
It is the first match of the year
for the Wolverines so they should
be able to get a good gauge on
where they stand against strong
competition.

TODD NEEDLE/Daily
Redshirt freshman Jehu Chesson not only caught his first pass but also his first touchdown last weekend against Akron.
What to watch or: lConn

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
1. Does Al Borges change the
interior offensive line?
All season long, offensive coor-
dinator Al Borges has said that
the starters for the offensive line
are penciled in. To be fair, the
tackle positions are written in
pen and then stenciled over in
Sharpie - fifth-year seniors Tay-
lor Lewan and Michael Schofield
aren't going anywhere.
The three interior linemen,
though, could be on the move.
Borges isn't pleased with the pro-
duction of those three spots, par-
ticularly in how the group is run
blocking. If there was any week
for a switch, it would be the one
before a bye week.
The trio of linemen - redshirt
sophomores Graham Glasgow
and Jack Miller and redshirt
freshman Kyle Kalis - had all
never started a game at the col-
legiate level before this season.
They've shown flashes ofcohesion
and talent, like late drives against
Akron and Notre Dame that
allowed fifth-year senior running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint to gash
the run defense, but haven't been
consistent enough to warrant the

same Sharpie treatment.
On Wednesday, Michigan
coach Brady Hoke listed three
players - redshirt sophomore
Chris Bryant and redshirt fresh-
men Ben Braden and Erik Mag-
nuson - who could potentially
see a bigger role Saturday. Bryant,
inparticular, drew abigresponse.
"Chris Bryant's a guy that
we've been excited about," Hoke
said. "He's been banged up a year
ago. Had a little bit early in fall
camp and probably right in the
middle. He got a little banged up
again, but he's back and playing
awfully hard."
If a change is going to come,
it will be now or during the bye
week before Big Ten play starts.
Saturday will be a good road
test for this young interior, but it
might be the last chance they get
to prove to Borges they can be a
solid group in between the stud
tackles.
"We're going to continue to
force people to compete at the
position," Borges said. "It's that
simple. But to say we're going to
start firing guys left and right, no.
We knew if we go through this
there's going to be some growing
pains, and there has been in the
first three games."

2. Does Gardner make
another costly error late in the
game?
In each of the last two con-
tests, redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner has made a costly
mistake late in the game, both of
which allowed the opponent to
get back in the game. Without
those turnovers, Michigan likely
wouldn't have had to sweat out
close finishes (then again, with-
out Gardner, the Wolverines like-
ly wouldn't have even been there
in the first place).
Does this happen again Satur-
day, in Michigan's first road con-
test of the year? All week, the talk
from the coaching staff has been
about Gardner making the right
decisions while also maintaining
the aggression and playmaking
ability that make him such a dan-
gerous weapon.
"Those are the plays you have
to say, 'Well, when do I cut my
losses?"' Borges said. "You heard
me say it with Denard all the
time. When do you do it? There's
a fine line between being a play-
maker and making a bad decision.
Sometimes, the playmakers step
over that line and sometimes the
playmakers supposedly step over
that line and make a play. So, as

a coach, you have to make sure
you keep them aggressive, you
can't scare them into playing cau-
tiously."
One way or the other, Gardner
keeping the ball out of the hands
of Husky defenders is going to
have a massive impact on this
game.
3. How do the young players
respond in their first road con-
test?
Early this week, UConn
announced that the game Sat-
urday had already sold out, and
that it will be the largest crowd
in the history of Rentschler
Field. Granted, there will be an
enormous Michigan contingent
there, but it will still be a differ-
ent, intimidating atmosphere for
freshmen or younger players who
have never played anywhere but
the Big House.
Why have the Wolverines
struggled so much on the road the
last couple years? According to
Hoke, it's "turnovers, turnovers,
turnovers," but that he has "no
idea" why they are happening
more on the road than at home.
On Saturday, look to see if
those freshman nerves led to the
turnovers Hoke so desperately
wants to avoid.
4. Do wide receivers not
named Gallongetinvolved?
Freshman tight Jake Butt -
who looked more like a wide
receiver than a tight end in spring
camp - is tied for third on this
team in receptions. But does that
say more about his performance
or the performances of the other
veteran wide receivers that were
supposed to make an impact this
year?
Besides for fifth-year senior
Jeremy Gallon, no other wide
out has done much to establish
themselves. Senior Jeremy Jack-
son has three catches. Fifth-year
seniors Drew Dileo and Joe Reyn-
olds have five and three catches,
respectively.
It's not just the veterans -
redshirt freshman Jehu Chesson
caught his first career pass last
week.
Against Notre Dame, Gallon
could do it all by himself, but it
won't be like that every game.
Who else will step up?

Breakdown: 'M'should bounce back vs. UConn

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
Only in college football can a
win feel so empty. The Michigan
football team was expected to
blow out lowly Akron. Instead,
the Zips came within yards
of one of the biggest upsets in
Michigan history.
The week leading up to the
Wolverines' trip to Connecticut
has felt different than last week,
though. Players spoke of embar-
rassment and redemption. They
said this week has been more
intense. The team feels like it
has something to prove.
What's waiting at the end of
the long week is a UConn team
just marginally better than
Akron. This is another game
Michigan should dominate.
Either way, the Wolverines
will learn alot about themselves.
Was the Akron game an aberra-
tion? Or maybe Notre Dame just
wasn't as good as it seemed. To
convince the skeptics, they must
not only win this week but win
big. If they do, here's how:
Michigan pass offense vs.
Connecticut pass defense
This matchup, as will be the
case the entire year, depends on
the play of redshirt junior quar-
terback Devin Gardner. If he
protects the ball, Michigan will
have no problem passing over
the Huskies' secondary.
That has been an issue for
him this year, though. So far, he
has thrown six interceptions in
three games and added a fumble
last week against Akron.
The good news for Michi-
gan is UConn's fearsome 2012
defense has been defanged in
2013. That unit, which ranked
ninth in the nation in yards
allowed, returns less than half
of its starters.
Last year, defensive coordi-
nator Don Brown was master-
ful at creating pressure. He left
for Boston College and took the
pass rush with him. This year?
The Huskies have zero sacks

through two games. That's
somehow even worse than
Michigan's pass rush.
UConn's cornerbacks are
solid but unspectacular. Byron
Jones is a converted safety. Obi
Melifonwu is young - he's just
a redshirt freshman, filling in
for an injured starter. Gardner
should be able to target his side
of the field.
Gardner usually isn't both-
ered by pressure, but he was
against Akron. That may have
just been a one-game abnor-
mality. If he doesn't rebound
against this team, then it's time
to worry.
Players to Watch: CB Obi
Melifonwu
Edge: Michigan
Michigan rush offense vs.
Connecticut rush defense
In the ground game, a highly
moveable object meets a so-far
stoppable force.
Through two games, UConn's
rush defense has been abys-
mal. The Huskies have allowed
an average of 212.50 yards per
game, good for 104th in the FBS.
That figure looks even worse
when considering the oppo-
nents: Towson - an FCS team
- and lowly Maryland. UConn
lost both games by double digits.
In the middle, the Huskies
are actually rather stout. Middle
linebacker Yawin Smallwood
is the defense's best player and
a professional prospect. He
already has 30 tackles in three
games.
Defensive tackles Julian
Campenni and Shamar Stephen
both started games in 2012,
and they weigh a combined 611
pounds.
Michigan's young interior
line has struggled so far in the
season, which could give it trou-
ble. So much so that Michigan
coach Brady Hoke and offensive
coordinator Al Borges both left
open the possibility of shaking
up the starters.
The Wolverines should find
room to the outside. But the lack

UConn quarterback Chandler
Whitmer is proficient at com-
pleting passes. He has a 61-per-
cent completion rate this season.
Problem is, he's proficient at
completing passes to the other
team, too. Last year, Whitmer
threw 16 interceptions - one off
the highest totals in the country.
Though he is mistake-prone,
he is an able passer. On the out-
side, Shak Phillips is a physical
receiver who has some speed
and could give the Michigan
secondary trouble. Akron beat
Michigan on multiple well-
executed fly routes. If Michigan
doesn't force turnovers, UConn

could do the same.
Whitmer can absorb con-
tact well, which is a good thing
because the Huskies have
allowed 10 sacks through two
games this year, good for 116th
in the country. This game could
be the spark for Michigan's non-
existent pass rush.

UConn's rush offense ranks
among the worst in the FBS - a

defensive units.
The state of the ground game
is especially dire. Through two
games, UConn has rushed for
a total of just 115 yards. That's
second-to-last in the nation.
Lyle McCombs is the Huskies'
leading rusher and was a work-
horse for the offense in 2012. He
is an adequate rusher, but lacks

overwhelming size, speed or
athleticism.
Michigan should be able to
dominate here.

Special Teams
Last year, with punter Will
Hagerup, Michigan was one of
the better punting teams in the
country. Then Hagerup was sus-
pended for the third time and
was forced to sit out the 2013
season. Michigan's punting
game has suffered.
Junior punter Matt Wile has
been inconsistent this year as
a replacement. His average of
34.6 yards per punt is third last
in the nation. Against Akron,
the shanks gave the Zips good
field position while the offense
struggled to find its rhythm.
UConn, though, isn't much
better, averaging 37.5 yards per
punt. It also lacks much athleti-
cism in the return game.

Kicker Chad Christen is
experienced and has gone 3-for-
3 on field-goal tries this year for
the Huskies. Last year he was a
middling 14-for-2L Despite the
punting woes, Michigan should
have the edge.

Michigan has struggled on
the road, and this one should be
rowdy. The people who make
these types of decisions for
some reason decided to make
this one a primetime game. It
will be the biggest game ever at
Rentschler Field.
