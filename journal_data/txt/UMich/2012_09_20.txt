Dean of students
still must approve
judiciary's ruling
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA and
ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporters
More than five months after
impeachment charges were
filed, the Central Student Judi-
ciary decided on the fate of the
leadership of the University's
chapter of College Republicans
early Wednesday morning. How-
ever, the decision is still pending
review by the University's Dean
of Students as the organization's
internal struggle.continues.
In a document obtained by
The Michigan Daily, the CSJ
decision explained that the chair
and the executive board made
some convincing arguments,
while others fell short. Eventu-
ally, CSJ ruled that the executive
board did not have the grounds
to impeach its chair, LSA senior
Rachel Jankowski. However, it
found credence in the executive
board's argument that Jankows-
ki did not give sufficient notice
to the group's membership when
she instituted constitutional
changes that made it more diffi-
cult to impeach her.
Maintaining Jankowski as

chair and invalidating the con-
stitutional changes she made
allows her to make alterations
again in the future as long as
she gives ample notice, and also
allows the executive board to file
for impeachment again as long
as they have sufficient proof that
she violated the bounds of her
position.
"In many ways, the College
Republicans' board has received
real-life lessons in the machi-
nations of politics and the con-
sequences of constitutional
brinksmanship," the decision
read. "We hope they will consid-
er that a lesson learned and use it
to further the organization and
principles they purport to repre-
sent."
In a written statement to The
Michigan Daily, Jankowski cel-
ebrated CSJ's decision, reiterat-
ing that the executive board's
accusations against her were
"baseless" and that its attempted
impeachment of her was "noth-
ing short of a petty attempt to
score cheap political points."
"Whether the board was
attempting to settle some politi-
cal or personal vendetta against
me, or whether they had ulterior
motives for attempting to remove
me from power, CSJ made the
correct recommendation in rein-
stating me as chair and deter-

ELECTION 2012
Economy, jobs
focus for young
Republicans

BLUE BIKES

Social issues less
important than
fiscal matters
By CHANNING ROBINSON
Daily Staff Reporter
While some young conserva-
tives disagree with the Republi-
can Party's stance on marriage
equality and abortion rights,
students identifying with the
GOP said they are more focused
on voting for the'candidate they
think is best suited to stabilize
the economy.
Members of the University's
chapter of College Republicans
said while- many college-aged
Republicans may not share the
same social values as Rom-
ney, his platform - focused on
reducing taxes, government
programs, spending and regu-
lation, while increasing trade,
energy production and labor
market flexibility - is critical to
fostering a stronger nation.
LSA senior Jared Boot, the
chair of Students for Romney at
the University and a member of
* College Republicans, said stu-

dents should make the economy
a priority in choosing a candi-
date to vote for in November.
"In this election cycle, the
economic crisis should be the
thing that students are voting
on - it's what I'm voting on,"
Boot said.
Boot recently spoke out in
support of gay students sup-
porting the GOP during the first
appearance
of the College
Republicans 1
at Gayz Craze
on Sept. 2, an 111111
annual event
held at the
beginning of the year by the
LGBT Issues Commission of
Central Student Government.
"I've had people come up to
me on campus and say, 'I'm fis-
cally conservative and I lean
toward being a hawk on foreign
policy issues, but I'm gay,"' Boot
said earlier in the month. "For
me, that's really discouraging
that people would be turned
away because of that."
LSA senior Rachel Jankowski,
the chair of the College Repub-
licans, echoed Boot's sentiments

Parents of sickle

less guidance
By RENUKA
SANTHANAGOPALAN
For theDaily
University researchers pub-
lished a study this month illus-
trating their findings on the
disparity between counseling
received by parents with new-
borns that had the sickle cell

trait, agene thatcan cause sickle
cell anemia, and newborns who
were carriers of cystic fibrosis.
The study, published in the
Journal of Genetic Counseling,
foundthat20 percentofparents
with newborns carrying the
sickle cell trait did not receive
genetic counseling, while only
8 percent of parents with new-
borns carrying the cystic fibro-
sis gene lacked counseling.
Sickle cell anemia and cys-
tic fibrosis are two recessive
genetic disorders, the former
common in African Americans

and the latter in Caucasians.
Kathryn Moseley, an assis-
tant professor of Pediatrics
and Communicable Diseases
at the Medical School and a
researcher who conducted the
study, said there are no medical
problems associated with car-
rying the cystic fibrosis gene,
while carriers of the sickle cell
trait have risks that must be
addressed, such as the possi-
bility of heart stroke or muscle
breakdown.

Medieval Man

How did you become inter-
ested in medievai history?
I became an academic and
a. medieval historian through
the side door, if you will. I
wanted to write a novel with
the kind of innocent ambition
only a 22 year old could have,
something inspired by the
books of Amin Maalouf and
Amitav Ghosh - who is coin-
cidentally a Zell Distinguished
International Writer in Resi-
dence this year. This idea led
me first to South Asia, where I
worked for a year, and then to
Egypt, where I lived for two
years, and finally to graduate
school, which seemed the saf-
est place for a novelist without

credentials. Two wonderful
professors,, William Jordan
and Michael Cook, gifted me
a love of historical research,
but I still have a file on my
computer with an unfinished
novel.
What is your primary
teaching style?
Ilove to teach seminars, to
talk with and directly to stu-
dents, to know their names
and to have.a good time. I don't
know how my students would
answer this question, but t've
always tried to imitate my
favorite teachers from high
school and college, and I would
call their styles tough love. I

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Jury picked in
ex-Detroit mayor's
corruption trial
A jury was picked Wednesday
in the corruption trial of former
Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpat-
rick, ending a nine-day process
peppered with legal wrangling
over whether enough blacks
were being considered for the
panel.
Five of the 12 jurors are black
as well as three of the six alter-
nates who also will sit in the box
for a trial that could stretch into
2013.
Kilpatrick, who quit the may-
or's office in 2008 due to a dif-
ferent scandal, is charged with
a series of crimes related to an
alleged scheme to pocket hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars
through racketeering and extor-
tion. The government says many
of his targets were contractors
who did business with the city
and were desperate to keep it.
His father, Bernard Kilpat-
rick, also is on trial, along with
construction contractor Bobby
Ferguson and former Detroit
water boss Victor Mercado.
PHOENIX
Groups protest
Ariz. immigration
law's enforcement
A day after the most conten-
tious provision of Arizona's
immigration law took effect, ral-
lies were held around Phoenix
to protest the mandate that civil
rights activists say will lead to
systematic racial profiling.
More than three dozen activ-
ists stood outside aU.S. Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement
building along a busy thorough-
fare Wednesday evening. They
chanted: "No papers, no fear."
Carlos Garcia, an organizer
with the immigrant rights group
S the Puente Movement, said the
strategy is to urge people not
to cooperate with immigration
enforcement efforts - whether
they're in the country legally or
not.
Tempe resident Beatrice
Jernigan said friends who are in
the country illegally are scared.
NEW ORLEANS, LA
Texas town 's
rental ban gets
second hearing
A Dallas suburb asked a fed-
eral appeals court Wednesday to
uphold an ordinance that would
ban undocumented immigrants
from renting homes in the town.
The full 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals agreed to rehear the
case after a three-judge panel
from the court ruled in March
that Farmers Branch's ordinance
is unconstitutional and imper-
missibly interferes with the fed-
eral immigration system.
The court's 15 judges didn't

indicate when they would
rule after hearing arguments
Wednesday from attorneys for
the town and a group of land-
lords and tenants who sued to
block the ordinance's enforce-
ment.
GAZA CITY
Palestinians: Two
killed in Israeli
strike in Gaza
An Israeli airstrike on a vehi-
cle in the southern Gaza Strip
Wednesday killed two people,
Hamas and health officials said.
A Hamas security official said
the strike hit a car that belonged
to the group's interior minis-
try driving east of the town of
Rafah. He spoke on condition of
anonymity because he was not
authorized to speak to the press.
In a statement, the Israeli
military confirmed the strike,
saying it targeted "two terror
operatives" - a man suspected
of planning an attack against
Israeli civilians and one accused
of selling weapons.

'Forty-seven
percent' comments
ripple across the
country
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP)
- Mitt Romney's off-handed
comment that as a candidate
he doesn't worry about the 47
percent of Americans who pay
no income taxes has quickly
entered the bloodstream in the
presidential campaign's most
hard-fought states.
His comment, in a video
revealed this week, is prompting
expressions of shock - but also
shrugs - from Nevada to Flori-
da to New Hampshire and the
handful ofbattleground states in
between.
Will it sway an election
expected to be close?
There was much discussion
in the relatively few states that
are still considered competitive,
likely to decide the race. Here,
as elsewhere, the question was
whether Romney was show-
ing himself to be insensitive or
merely delivering the hard truth
a nation at an economic cross-
roads must face.
People's answers could make
an Election Day difference in
states where the race is tight.
"It sounds like he's leaving out

half of America, if you ask me,"
said Gary Gabriel, an indepen-
dent from suburban Columbus,
Ohio, who decided in light of
Romney's comments to support
President Barack Obama.
But the remarks also reaf-
firmed the opinions of some
Romney supporters.
"I worry a lot about the soci-
ety we're turning into, more of
an entitlement mentality," said
Randy Schumaker, a Denver-
area IT manager.
It all underscored the cam-
paign's focus on the economy.
And it stoked deeper questions
about voters' expectations about
the government's role in Ameri-
cans' daily lives.
Outrage. Nodding approval.
Both followed Romney's conten-
tion that 47 percent of Ameri-
cans support Obama and that
they "are dependent upon gov-
ernment" and "believe that they
are victims, who believe that
government has a responsibility
to care for them."
In a Gallup poll taken Tues-
day, about a third of the sur-
veyed registered voters said they
would be less likely to support
Romney in light of the remarks,
But more said the comments
would not affecttheirvotes. And
most voters have already made
up their minds on whom they
will support, according to this
and other surveys.

During the investiga-
tion President Barack Obama
ordered Holder to withhold

controlled House voted to hold
Holder in contempt and has
authorized a civil lawsuit to
make the administration turn

said he was not denied access to
any of the documents.
Two of the 2,000 weapons
thought to have been acquired
by illicit buyers in the Fast and

U.S. border agent Brian Terry.
About 1,400 of the total have
yet to be recovered.
Holder noted in a statement
that the report confirmed his
assertions that the flawed
strategies were driven by field
agents without his knowledge
or approval and that depart-

He said the report's disci-
plinary recommendations are
being pursued and "we now
have two men in custody and
we will continue to aggressive-
ly pursue the remaining fugi-
tives to ensure justice for Agent
Terry, his family and his fellow

Fast and Furious has pro-
duced charges against 20 gun
traffickers, 14 of whom have
pleaded guilty so far.

After strike, Chicago
teachers return to work

Students missed
seven days of
school because of
work stoppage
CHICAGO (AP) - Mayor
Rahm Emanuel secured an
extension of Chicago's school
day and empowered principals
to hire the teachers they want.
Teachers were able to soften a
new evaluation process and win
some job protections.
As students returned to the
classroom Wednesday after
a seven-day teachers strike,
both sides found reasons to cel-
ebrate victory. But neither the
school-reform movement nor
organized labor achieved the
decisive breakthrough it had
sought. And whether the impli-
cations extend beyond Chicago
may depend on the next case
having a similar cast of charac-
ters and political pressures.
Unions hoped the walkout
would prove they were still rel-
evant, and some reform groups
were disappointed with the
city's concessions.
At times, the contract talks
seemed overshadowed by per-
sonalities, with the mayor and
union leaders occasionally trad-
ing insults and questioning each
other's motives.
Still, everyone involved in
the dispute emerged with an
achievement to trumpet: Teach-
ers said the strike sparked an

important national conversa-
tion about school reform. Union
activists said it helped inspire
public employee unions that
have been losingground. Eman-
uel declared it a boon for stu-
dents trapped in failing schools.
The president of the Ameri-
can Federation of Teachers said
the strike showed that teach-
ers want a voice in improving
schools rather than shouldering
the blame for those that are fail-
ing.
"The bottom line is ... you
had teachers standing up for
what they need to teach and
what students need to learn,"
Randi Weingarten said, citing
concerns about school closings,
standardized tests and a lack

French magazine publishes crude
cartoons of prophet Muhammad

Images could incite
outrage in the
Middle East
PARIS (AP) - France stepped
up security Wednesday at its
embassies across the Muslim
world after a French satirical
weekly revived a formula that
it has already used to capture
attention: Publishingcrude, lewd
caricatures of Islam's Prophet
Muhammad.
Wednesday's issue of the pro-
vocative satirical weekly Char-
lie Hebdo, whose offices were
firebombed last year, raised
concerns that France could face
violent protests like the ones tar-
geting the United States over an
amateur video produced in Cali-
fornia that have left at least 30
people dead.
The drawings, some of which
depicted Muhammad naked
and in demeaning or porno-
graphic poses, were met with
a swift rebuke by the French
government, which warned the
magazine could be inflaming
tensions, even as it reiterated
France's free speech protec-
tions.

The principle of freedom
of expression "must not be
infringed," Foreign Minister
Laurent Fabius said, speaking
on France Inter radio.
But he added: "Is it perti-
nent, intelligent, in this con-
text to pour oil on the fire? The
answer is no."
Anger over the film "Inno-
cence of Muslims" has fueled vio-
lent protests from Asia to Africa.
In the Lebanese port city of
Tyre, tens of thousands of people
marched in the streets Wednes-
day, chanting "Oh, America, you
are God's enemy!"
Worried France might be tar-
geted, the government ordered
its embassies, cultural centers,
schools and other official sites
to close on Friday - the Muslim
holy day - in 20 countries. It
also immediately shut down its
embassy and the French school
in Tunisia, the site of deadly
protests at the U.S. Embassy
last week.
The French Foreign Ministry
issued a travel warning urging
French citizens in the Muslim
world to exercise "the great-
est vigilance," avoiding pub-
lic gatherings and "sensitive
buildings."

The controversy could
prove tricky for France, which
has struggled to integrate its
Muslim population, West-
ern Europe's largest. Many
Muslims believe the Prophet
Muhammad should not be
depicted at all - even in a flat-
tering way - because it might
encourage idolatry.
Violence provoked by the
anti-Islam video, which por-
trays the prophet as a fraud,
womanizer and child molester,
began with a Sept. 11 attack on
the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, then
quickly spread to Libya, where
an attack on the U.S. Consulate
in Benghazi left the U.S. ambas-
sador and three other Ameri-
cans dead.
In Washington, White House
spokesman Jay Carney said the
Obama administration believed
the French magazine images
"will be deeply offensive to
many and have the potential to
be inflammatory."
"We don't question the right
of something like this to be pub-
lished," he said, pointing to the
U.S. Constitution's protections
of free expression. "We just
question the judgment behind
the decision to publish it."

Train Detroit for the future
City should implement new rail system
J due time, Detroit may be able to lay claim to a modern public
transportation system. Since early 2007, a proposed project -
called M1 RAIL for Woodward Avenue - outlays a 3.4-mile
light-rail system, which would connect the downtown and uptown
areas along historic Woodward Avenue. Construction, optimisti-
cally scheduled to begin in 2012, has been stalled due to uncertainty
over the long-term viability of the project. The building of the M1
RAIL would stimulate the economy and the development of jobs in
the city, promoting a better future for Detroit.

go to a political convention and say something,

Light-rail is one of the most economically
advantageous forms of mass inner-city transit.
According to the AAA Fuel Gauge Report, the
average price of gas now costs Michigan drivers
$4.04 per gallon. According to the Detroit Free
Press, the average price of gas in Michigan is
the eighth highest in the nation. Furthermore,
Detroit's bus system has been suffering from
budget cuts, vehicle breakdowns and disgrun-
tled union members. While the cost of travel
using the Ml RAIL is yet to be determined, it's
certain that this mode of transportation will be
cost-efficient and eco-friendly.
Since a light-rail system would be highly
economical, it could also encourage com-
muting throughout the city, which would
increase commerce and trade among the 34.5
percent of the city's residents who live below
the poverty line, according to census data.
The project remains under review by the Fed-
eral Transportation Administration and the
city itself. On Monday, United States Trans-
portation Secretary Ray LaHood met with
Michigan House Speaker Jase Bolger and
House Majority Floor Leader Jim Stamas in
Washington D.C. in an attempt to garner nec-
essary funding to commence construction.

The most promising aspect of the Mt RAIL
is that the majority of the project would be
privately funded. The rail would provide a
transportation upgrade without draining the
struggling city. The project has a total estimat-
ed cost of $137 million. It would receive $25
million from a federal grant, $16 million from
New Markets Tax Credits and $84 million
coming from private donations. These private
investors have agreed to fund the rail line's
operations until 2025. In addition to prepared
funding, similar projects have found success
in Texas and Oregon. In Dallas, the DART rail
system, also privately funded, was responsible
for an estimated 27,000 jobs as a result of an
initial $1 billion investment.
With the promise of accessible transpor-
tation and the gift of funds to create it, the
proposed M1 RAIL project is an investment
in Michigan's once-great port-side epicen-
ter. With an effective transportation system,
the city will become much more attractive to
new businesses and job-seekers young and
old. With an influx of people taking advan-
tage of the ease of transportation, the econ-
omy and development of Detroit will witness
positive change.

So, what are you doing now?
Reading this article, checking
Facebook, debating whether or not
to reply to the SO pending e-mails
in your inbox? Maybe you're tweet-
ing about how we'll "beat the Irish"
this weekend, or maybe you're in
the UGLi poring over structures
that remind you less of aromatic
hydrocarbons and more of Honey-
comb cereal. You might be flipping
through a $200 history textbook
you'll read less than half of this
semester, or perhaps you're ana-
lyzing a bottomless stack of read-
ings on failed marketing strategies.
Here's the bottom line, though:
you're focusing so narrowly on
what's immediately in front you,
without actually doing what you
came to college to do.
Don't get me wrong - most of
what we spend time on every day in
college is necessary and likely ben-

eficial for our futures. However, the
"future" we so wistfully speak of
doesn't just start when we walk out
of here, degrees in hand. It starts
now. In fact, it's already begun. So
many of us get so caught up in the
small details of the everyday that
we lose sight of why we had such
high ambitions to begin with. We
forget the goals and dreams we
wrote about in our college applica-
tions. Instead we obsess over tasks
that, in the grand scheme, pale in
comparison. Maybe occasionally,
we'll have those 3 a.m. conversa-
tions with roommates on the prob-
lems of society, health care, the
economy, politics - but before we
know it, we're back to the minutiae.
Sure, I'm as much of a hypocrite
as anyone. I find contentment in
picking out just the right words for
these columns and I hope that at
best someone might be inspired by
what I say to do something. I let my
brain pick apart the problems and
leave the solutions in the hands of
others. I, too, have fallen into the
trap of thinking, writing, talking,
analyzing - and not really doing.
"Doing" doesn't necessarily entail
physical work, but rather means
working toward those greater goals
outside the scope of this campus.
College is inevitably a time for
change. So many people discover
their true passions during their
time on campus, or realize exactly
how they want to make their mark
on the world. Those lightbulb
moments when we find what we
want to spend our lives really doing,
are incredible. But they shouldn't
just be random, occasional epipha-
nies. Those goals and ambitions
should resonate in everything we
do, every day. Even if you haven't

yet found that one thing that really
gets you going, you still probably
know which things you generally
like or don't like. Think about those
things even through your mundane,
everyday tasks. Truly do things
with a purpose.

conversations
are few and

One year ago Thursday, Presi-
dent Barack Obama repealed "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell," a policy that
banned openly gay men and lesbi-
ans from serving in the military. In
repealing DADT, President Obama
showed his commitment to a belief
in the equality of all Americans and
the fundamental principle that our
nation should "welcome the ser-
vice of every patriot." On this his-
torical one-year anniversary, it's
important to reflect on the repeal of
legislation that has had an impact
on both the lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender community and
the nation at large. This historic
event also shows the progress our
president has made towards LGBT
equality. With the repeal of this dis-
criminatory policy, lesbian and gay
service members, their families, the
armed forces and the United States
are better off.
DADT was signed into law by
President Clinton in 1993 as an
attempt to compromise between bar-
ring homosexuals from service and
allowing them to do so. For lesbian
and gay service members, however,
this meant hiding their identities and
never feeling fully comfortable, all
while they were risking their lives
and sacrificing other personal free-
doms in order to serve their country.
This sacrifice is difficult to imag-
ine. Service in the military isn't your
typical job. The expectations that you
face at work at a civilian job often end
as soon as you punch out. Serving in

the armed forces is entirely different.
It's not a nine-to-five job. As many
in the military say, it's a lifestyle
that requires conscious membership
24 hours a day. Yet, under DADT,
LGBT Americans were told to hide
an important part of their life. They
couldn't fully participate in the spirit
of camaraderie of their fellow service
members because of their sexual ori-
entation.
Since DADT required gay men and
lesbians to refrain from revealing
their sexual orientation at any time,
it sometimes prevented them from
utilizing the rights and family ben-
efits that military members normally
receive. Deployed LGBT service
members weren't always able to des-
ignate their partners as caregivers of
their children in the family care plan.
Similarly, if a gay or lesbian service
member died while serving their
country, their partner may not have
been the first person notified.
DADT meant that fully qualified
and trained members of the military,
even those who were highly special-
ized in their areas of expertise, could
be fired forrevealingtheirsexual ori-
entation. Under DADT, we reduced
the size of our eligible military force
through discrimination based on
sexual orientation. Our government
told men and women who were will-
ing to make the ultimate sacrifice for
their country that their sacrifice was
not worthwhile because of their sex-
ual orientation.
President Obama understood the

message that DADT sent. He argued
that people shouldn't have to hide
who they are in order to serve their
country. He felt that all who sacri-
fice their personal freedoms and
risk their lives in the service of the
United States should be allowed to
do so without being silenced or dis-
criminated against.
President Obama ended the lone-
liness, shame, paranoia and sense of
injustice that many service mem-
bers felt. In doing so, he strength-
ened our military and country. The
repeal of DADT embodies the prin-
ciples of fairness and equality that
Americans should extol. President
Obama's push for equality is not
limited to this repeal. This anniver-
sary reminds us not only of the push
President Obama has made to guar-
antee equality to all, but also of how
much work still needs to be dong.
On this anniversary, it's impor-
tant to think about the progress that
we have made in ashort year toward
bringing equality to all Americans.
President Obama's support of the
rights of LGBT Americans sets him
apart as a fighter for equality and
for the guarantee of respect for all
Americans. In one year, we have
progressed a great deal in the name
of equality. Let's remember all the
work that still needs to be done and
the lives that have been positively
impacted by the change we've seen
in the last year.

According to Coleman-Burns,
the goal of GENESIS is to pro-
vide more opportunities for stu-
dents from underrepresented
groups to earn a nursing degree
and increase the number of
minority students matriculating
into nursing schools.
Nursing Dean Kathleen
Potempa wrote in an e-mail
interview that GENESIS is
essential for maintaining
diversity and a high standard
of excellence, in the Nursing
School.

"The University of Michigan
School of Nursing is committed
 to graduating nursing profes-
sionals who represent and will
provide world-class care for
people of all backgrounds and
cultures," she wrote. "The GEN-
ESIS program is an excellent
means to finding and retaining
students with the potential to
achieve great success."

and 64 males, according to
the Office of the Registar. The

Fitzgerald also noted that
financial aid has been increasing
at almost double the rate of tuition
to accommodate for rising rates.
"We know lots of Michigan
families are struggling financial-
ly," he said.
Financial aid increased by 10.1
percent for the 2012-2013 aca-
demic year, to accommodate for
rising tuition rates. At the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents meeting in
June, University President Mary
Sue Coleman said the adminis-
tration has been dedicated to pro-
viding aid to struggling families.
"For four straight years now,
we have presented a financial
aid budget that covers the full
increase in tuition for our needi-
est students," Coleman said. "This
year's increase in financial aid will
come in the form of grants, not
loans, which helps reduce (the)
student debt burden."
Though the University will
receive 2 percent more in-state
aid than last year, it comes on the
form for this election, they added
they are hopeful for a change in
the GOP's position on certain
social issues in the future.
Hayes said the Republican
Party is evolving on social issues,
specifically by diversifying its
membership.
"We've got folks across the
spectrum representing the party
- look at Richard Tisei, who's
running for Congress in Massa-
chusetts," Hayes said. "He's a gay
Republican who's emphasized
his focus on representing the
people of Massachusetts, not on
being a caricature."
Zoey Kotzambasis - vice
president of the University of
Arizona's chapter of the College
Republicans who was recently
featured in The New York Times
as an example of an emerging
Republican voter - said while
she is socially liberal, she is fis-
cally conservative, which is why
she will be voting for Romney in
November.
"The biggest issues that I align
with (Romney) on are primarily
economic ...job creation, and also
taxes and fiscal responsibility,
especially spending," Kotzamba-
sis said in an interview.
Kotzambasis suggested it
might benefit the Republican

heels of a 15-percent cut to higher
education in 2011. State Rep. Jeff
Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) said its crit-
ical that universities in Michigan
continue to see a greater increase
in state aid.
"University support in Michi-
gan is a downward trend. Rather
than diminishing support, we
should be increasing it," Irwin
said.
According to Irwin, ideologi-
cal battles in the Michigan House
of Representatives mirror the
struggles fought at the national
level, noting that he believes
Republicans have made it clear
that education is their lowest pri-
ority.
"It impairs the academic free-
dom of colleges and universities
and diminishes their value to our
communities. That's a big mis-
take," Irwin said. "Those kinds

Party to reconsider its social
platform.
"I don't think that it is right for
(Republicans) to champion free-
dom and liberty in the economic
sector and the private sector
with businesses, but to not also
champion that in social issues,"
Kotzambasis said. "I think it's
kind of contradictory. If you're
championing freedom, it should
be in every aspect."
LSA junior Margot McGowan
Staebler, who identifies as a Dem-
ocrat, said social issues are very
important to her this election
year and will play a significant
part in her decision to vote for
Obama.
"In fact, that's probably my
biggest set of issues with the
Romney-Ryan ticket," Staebler
said. "I believe in a woman's right
to choose ... it should be a per-
sonal choice, not a government-
mandated policy."
Staebler said she disagreed
with nearly every social stance
Romney has taken and expects
Obama to earn the majority of
the youth vote.
"I think that social issues,
such as LGBTQ rights, abortion
law, etc. will play a big role in
this election, particularly with
the youth vote," Staebler said.

Coleman-Burns said many
high school counselors are not
knowledgeable about the track
to receiving a nursing degree,
and the program is designed
to combat the lack of aware-
ness. She added she believes it is
essential for prospective nurs-
ing students to pursue a college
preparatory curriculum in mid-
dle and high school.
"Too often if a young person
indicates an interest in nursing,
they are diverted from a college
prep program, with lots of math
and science and writing skills,
to a vocational experience,
which doesn't help the kind of
talent that we need going into
the 21st century," she said.
Once enrolled in the program,
students are supported through
peer study groups, mentoring
and cultural competence train-
ing to help them succeed at the
University and in their careers.

"It is important, especially
with the health care shortage,
to be able help recruit and pre-

she said.
Coleman-Burns said that of
the 75 students who have par-
ticipated in GENESIS since it
started, 66 have graduated.
"The true test of our commit-
ment to the education endeavor
is to see the students come out
with a degree," she said.
She added that furthering
diversity in the nursing field is
a key aspect of the project, as
research shows that students
who come from rural or disad-
vantaged communities are like-
ly to return to those places once
they receive their degrees, and
can help reduce health problems
that exist there.
"When we bring in persons
who have, perhaps, a vested
interest in rural communi-
ties and serving and doing the
research that will improve the
health of the communities they
come from, it improves the sci-
ence that we are well known for
here at the University," Cole-
man-Burns said. "That really
is how diversity does inform
and improve the excellence and
quality of the scholarly science
that we do at the University."

spring that, as a candidate, "my
job is notto worry about" the 47
percent of Americans who don't
earn enough to pay income
taxes and are likely to support
President Barack Obama. He
also described them as people
who are "dependent upon gov-
ernment, who believe that they
are victims, who believe they
are entitled" to a wide range of
benefits.
In the days since the maga-
zine Mother Jones posted the
secretly taped comments to
donors, the Romney campaign
has tried to fend off criticism
that the Republican candidate
was writing off nearly half the
country or was disdainful of
them.
Earlier in the day, Romney
tried to draw a distinction
between himself and Obama.
"The question of this campaign
is not who cares about the poor
and the middle class. I do. He

Genetic counseling is recom-
mended for parents of carriers so
they are informed about the pos-
sible risks of conditions.
Sickle cell anemia is character-
ized by abnormal hemoglobin in
red blood cells, which causes the
cells to form a sickle, or crescent
shape, and inhibits the delivery of
oxygen throughout the body.
Cystic fibrosis is a disease that

does," Romney said at an Atlan-
ta fundraiser. "The question is
who can help the poor and the
middle class. I can. He can't."
Romney has said he was talk-
ing on the video about support
for his campaign, a point he
returned to Wednesday at the
Miami forum hosted by the
Spanish-language TV network
Univision.
"I know that I'm not going
to get 100 percent of the vote
and my campaign will focus on
those people we think we can
bring in to support me, but this
is a campaign about helping
people who need help," Rom-
ney said.
"My campaign is about the
100 percent in America," he
said.
The forum, which was
broadcast nationally in Spanish
from a swing state that could
help decide the presidential
contest, was an opportunity to
court Hispanics. That growing
voting bloc overwhelmingly
supported President Barack
Obama four years ago.
However, the televised ses-
sion initially focused on the
caught-on-tape remarks, the
latest in a string of missteps on
domestic and foreign policy for
the Republican candidate seven
weeks out from Election Day.
Speaking to Romney in
Spanish, the Univision hosts
peppered him with questions
about the video before turning
to his reluctance to clarify his
sickle cell anemia screening has
been in place since the 1970s,
whereas cystic fibrosis screening
is fairly new in comparison.
"My theory is that the biggest
issue is that cystic fibrosis is in
front of the doctor because it's
newer," she said.
She added that people generally
believe African Americans already
know about sickle cell disease, so
doctors aren't referring to them
for counseling as often.
Moseley found that there is
often a lack of sickle cell coun-
selors available to accept new
patients, causing inefficient han-
dling of patients that may need
more counseling due to the pos-
sible severity of their condition.

newborns carrying the sickle cell

support for Arizona's contro-
versial immigration law.
Romney backed away from
his support earlier in the year
for policies that would promote
"self-deportation" of illegal
immigrants. He said he sup-
ported policies that might give
legal status to young illegal
immigrants who serve in the
military or pursue higher edu-
cation.
"We're not going to round
up people around the country
and deport them," he said. "We
need to provide a long-term
solution."
He declined to detail his
solution, despite being pressed
by the hosts.
Romney assailed Obama
for failing to deliver cam-
paign promises to overhaul the
nation's immigration system.
"He never tried to fix the
immigration system," Romney
said of the Democratic incum-
bent. "I will actually reform
the immigration system and
make it work for the people of
America."
The Obama campaign
responded by arguing that His-
panic voters have reason not to
trust Romney.

tinued to refuse to answer any

said in a statement.

percent of those patients are only
counseled in doctors' offices.
Moseley added that genetic
counselors are needed in these
situations to give more long-term
guidance to the patients and fill
the gaps when doctors may not
have the time.
While Moseley is still search-
ing for the reason for why there
is a genetic counseling disparity
between the two cases, she said
it does not seem likely that it is a
racial issue.
She added that keeping
patients informed is exceedingly
important, and doctors need to
take an active interest in carriers
of the sickle cell trait and cystic
fibrosis and ask their patients to
seek counseling.

Pot sales could lead to
tax windfall for states

Three states could
legalize marijuana
this fall
DENVER (AP) - A catchy
pro-marijuana jingle for Colora-
do voters considering legalizing
the drug goes like this: "Jobs for
our people. Money for schools.
Who could ask for more?"
It's a bit more complicated
than that in the three states -
Colorado, Oregon and Wash-
ington - that could become the
first to legalize marijuana this
fall.
The debate over how much
tax money recreational marijua-
na laws could produce is playing
an outsize role in the campaigns
for and against legalization -
and both sides concede they're
not really sure what would hap-
pen.
At one extreme, pro-pot
campaigners say it could prove
a windfall for cash-strapped
states with new taxes on pot and
reduced criminal justice costs.
At the other, state govern-
ment skeptics warn legalization
would lead to costly legal battles
and expensive new bureaucra-
cies to regulate marijuana.
In all three states asking vot-
ers to decide whether residents
can smoke pot, the proponents
promise big rewards, though
estimates of tax revenue vary
widely:
- Colorado's campaign touts
money for school construction.
Ads promote the measure with
the tag line, "Strict Regulation.
Fund Education." State analysts
project somewhere between $5
million and $22 million a year.
An economist whose study was
funded by a pro-pot group proj-
ects a $60 million boost by 2017.
- Washington's campaign
promises to devote more than
half of marijuana taxes to
substance-abuse prevention,
research, education and health
care. Washington state analysts
have produced the most gener-
ous estimate of how much tax
revenue legal pot could pro-
duce, at nearly $2 billion over
five years.

- Oregon's measure, known
as the Cannabis Tax Act, would
devote 90 percent of recreation-
al marijuana profits tothe state's
general fund. Oregon's fiscal
analysts haven't even guessed
at the total revenue, citing the
many uncertainties inherent in
a new marijuana market. They
have projected prison savings
between $1.4 million and $2.4
million a year if marijuana use
was legal without a doctor's rec-
ommendation.
"We all knowthere's a market
for marijuana, but right now the
profits are all going to drug car-
tels or underground," said Brian
Vicente, a lawyer working for
Colorado's Campaign To Regu-
late Marijuana Like Alcohol.
But there are numerous ques-
tions about the projections, and
since no state has legalized mar-
ijuana for anything but medical
purposes, the actual result is
anyone's guess.
Among the problems: No
one knows for certain how
many people are buying black-
market weed. No one knows
how demand would change if
marijuana were legal. No one
knows how much prices would
drop, or even what black-market
pot smokers are paying now,
though economists generally
use a national estimate of $225
an ounce based on self-reported
prices compiled online.
"It's difficult to size upa mar-
ket even if it's legal, certainly if
it's illegal," said Jeffrey Miron,
a Harvard University economist
who has studied the national
tax implications of the legaliza-
tion of several drugs.
In Colorado, the $60 million
figure comes from Christopher
Stiffler, an economist for the
nonpartisan Colorado Center
on Law & Policy. He looked at
the state's potential marijuana
market in a study funded by the
pro-legalization Drug Policy
Alliance. The figure comes from
a combination of state and local
taxes and projected savings to
law enforcement.
Marijuana smokers and deal-
ers, he argued, pay a premium
now because the drug is illegal,
and if government can find a
way to capture that excess, tax

collections should rise.
"You can basically take
advantage of economies of scale,
and the price of marijuana will
go down and government can
come in and capture the differ-
ence," Stiffler said.
The biggest unknown: Would
the federal government allow
marijuana markets to material-
ize?
When California voters con-
sidered marijuana legalization
in 2010, U.S. Attorney General
Eric Holder warned that the
federal government would not
look the other way and allow a
state marijuana market in defi-
ance of federal drug law. Holder
vowed a month before the elec-
tion to "vigorously enforce"
federal marijuana prohibition.
Voters rejected the measure.
Holder hasn't been as vocal
this year, but that could change.
In early September, nine former
heads of the U.S. Drug Enforce-
ment Administration called on
Holder to issue similar warn-
ings to Colorado, Oregon and
Washington.
That political uncertain-
ty could translate into states
spending thousands of dollars
to defend the laws, critics say.
"I think it's important that
this ballot lay out for the voters
how much litigation is going to
result from this," said Colora-
do assistant Attorney General
Michael Dougherty, a critic of
the legislation.
Legalization proponents
counter that some of the 17 med-
ical-marijuana states already
collect pot taxes in violation of
federal law, which does not con-
done medical use of the drug.
Colorado collects several mil-
lion dollars a year in pot-related
taxes, including sales taxes,
licensing fees and fees paid by
patients to acquire the drug.
Oregon last year doubled the
cost of a medical marijuana card
to raise money for things like
clean water and school health
programs.
"Marijuana can be regulated,
can be taxed, can be sold. We're
doing it now, just currently to
sick people," said Vicente, the
lawyer working on the Colorado
legalization campaign.

Fire controlled
before reaching gas
plant
REYNOSA, Mexico (AP) - The
death toll ina pipeline fire at a dis-
tributionplantnearthe U.S. border
has risen to 29, Mexico's state-
owned oil company said Wednes-
day.Atleast46others were injured,
and more might be missing.
Juan Jose Suarez, director of
the state-owned Petroleos Mexi-
canos company, told local media
earlier in the day that at least five
workers had not been seen since
the blast. On Tuesday, the com-
pany, known as Pemex, said in
its Twitter account that a total of
seven people were unaccounted
for.
President Felipe Calderon said
the quick reaction of emergency
teams prevented a "real catastro-
phe," by controlling the fire before
it reached the huge tanks of a

neighboring gas processing plant.
The enormous fire Tuesday hit a
distribution center near the border
with Texas that handles natural
gas coming in from wells and sends
it to a processing plant next door.
"The timely response by oil
workers, firefighters and the Mex-
ican army was able to control the
fire relatively quickly and avoid
a real catastrophe of bigger pro-
portions and greater damages if
the fire had spread to the center
for gas processing, which is right
there," Calderon said in a speech
in Mexico City.
The blast and ensuing fire left
charred tanks and a mound of tan-
gled steel at the walled plant near
the border city of Reynosa, across
from McAllen, Texas.
Two of the injured were report-
ed in serious condition.
Dr. Jaime Urbina Rivera, dep-
uty medical director of Hospital
Materno Infantil de Reynosa just
a few miles from the plant, said his
hospital had received nine injured
workers with first- and second-

degree burns covering 10 percent
to 40 percent of their bodies, with
the burns concentrated on their
backs and legs. They all arrived
conscious, he said.
Pemex officials said the blast
appeared to have been caused
by an accidental leak, and there
was no sign so far of sabotage.
The Mexican Attorney General's
Officeopened aninvestigationinto
the explosion Wednesday, sending
more than 20 investigators into
the site, which was blocked to the
press.
The facility's perimeter walls,
topped with razor wire as a secu-
rity measure in a country that has
seen thieves, saboteurs and drug
gangs target oil installations, pre-
sented an obstacle for plant work-
ers trying to flee.
Esteban Vazquez Huerta, 18,
who was inside the plant when
the fire erupted, managed to find
a gap in the wire, scale a wall and
escape. "We had to climb the wall
from that side because the fire, the
heat was reaching us,"

Arctic ice shrinks to
an all-time low level

Ice cap at North
Pole 18-precent
smaller than
previous record
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
critical climate indicator show-
log an ever warming world,
the amount of ice in the Arctic
Ocean shrank to an all-time
low this year, obliterating old
records.
The ice cap at the North Pole
measured 1.32 million square
miles on Sunday. That's 18 per-
cent smaller than the previous
record of 1.61 million square
miles set in 2007, according
to the National Snow and Ice
Data Center in Boulder, Colo.
Records go back to 1979 based
on satellite tracking.
"On top of that, we're smash-
ing a record that smashed a
record," said data center scien-
tist Walt Meier. Sea ice shrank
in 2007 to levels 22 percent
below the previous record of
2005.
Ice in the Arctic melts in
summer and grows in winter,
and it started growing again
on Monday. In the 1980s, Meier
said, summer sea ice would
cover an area slightly smaller
than the Lower 48 states. Now
it is about half that.
Man-made global warming
has melted more sea ice and
made it thinner over the last
couple decades with it getting
much more extreme this year,
surprisingly so, said snow and

ice data center director Mark
Serreze.
"Recently the loss of summer
ice has accelerated and the six
lowest September ice extents
have all been in the past six
years," Serreze said. "I think
that's quite remarkable."
Serreze said except for one
strong storm that contributed
to the ice loss, this summer
melt was more from the steady
effects of day-to-day global
warming. But he and others say
the polar regions are where the
globe first sees the signs of cli-
mate change.
"Arctic sea ice is one of the
most sensitive of nature's ther-
mometers," said Jason Box,
an Ohio State University polar
researcher.
What happens in the Arctic
changes climate all over the
rest of the world, scientists have
reported in studies.
The ice in the Arctic "essen-
tially acts like an air conditioner
by keeping things cooler," Meier
said. And when sea ice melts
more, it's like the air conditioner
isn't running efficiently, he said.
Sea ice reflects more than 90
percent of the sun's heat off the
Earth, but when it is replaced
by the darker open ocean, more
than half of the heat is absorbed
into the water, Meier said.
Scientists at the snow and ice
data center said their computer
models show an Arctic that
would be essentially free of ice
in the summer by 2050,but they
add that current trends show ice
melting faster than the comput-
ers are predicting.

Toussaint, the redshirt junior
running back, loves to dance,
but he couldn't dance with his
teammates as they celebrated
late into the night with the stu-
dent section after their stunning
35-31 victory over the Fighting
Irish. Toussaint watched. He
was sidelined with a shoulder
injury.
And the fact that he didn't
play, that he couldn't help his
teammates, still kills him.
"That's exactly what I think
about to this day," Toussaint said
on Tuesday. "I could've played."
Last year's Under The Lights
game was a frenetic rush of
lights and colors, pom poms and
"Seven Nation Army." On the
field, it was a pinball game of
turnovers and big plays, a battle
to establish some - any - mea-
sure of rhythm.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
said he remembers thinking to
himself that the game wasn't
like a normal game. It didn't
have any sort of continuity. It
didn't have Toussaint.
"The rhythm of the game
wasn't there anywhere,"Hoke
said. "There wasn't any momen-
tum. Anywhere."
Some of that stemmed from
emotion, some from mistakes
and fluke plays. But Hoke drew a
connection between the game's
lack of momentum and the fail-
ure to establish a running game
outside of senior quarterback
Denard Robinson.
Toussaint sat as his fellow
running backs sputtered. Ste-
phen Hopkins, now a junior,
went for just 10 yards, and he
was the leader of the group.
Fifth-year senior Vincent Smith
rushed for three. Michael Shaw
actually lost three yards.
"I was speechless," Toussaint
said. "It really hurt me to know I
could've done something to help
the team."
Toussaint missed both the
Tuesday and Wednesday prac-
tices in the week before the
game, and he knew he couldn't
play. Still, he explained that
sometimes, a football player
must play through injury.
This year, Toussaint is
healthy, but his play has lagged
behind last season's pace.
Against Air Force, he ran for just
seven yards,though he improved
against Massachusetts, rushing

for 85 yards and a touchdown.
Hoke and redshirt junior
tackle Taylor Lewan have put
much of the blame on the offen-
sive line's inability to spring
Toussaint.
Lewan said the line lacked
an edge, and Hoke has tried to
address that in practice.
"We have very physical prac-
tices, even during game week,
you know, and that's a demeanor
and a mentality," said offensive
coordinator Al Borges. "Don't
expect them just to show up and
all of a sudden be trained kill-
ers on game day if their mindset
isn't right during the week."
Of course, Toussaint won't
be Notre Dame's chief concern.
Michigan's past two games
against Notre Dame have been
dominated by Robinson. In 2010,
he totaled more than 500 yards.
Last year, without Toussaint

to share the burden, he totaled
nearly 450 yards and five touch-
downs.
The Fighting Irish focused
their defense on stopping Rob-
inson last year, often sending a
safety into the box or using both
a linebacker and a safety to box
him in.
"They were keenly aware
of what Denard had done the
year before," Borges said. "They
restructured their defense to
stop him and force the issue
with the passing game."
Borges explained that every
team tries to stop Robinson but
"they don't all have the ability to
do it."
Notre Dame's defense,
though, has proved capable.
Last week, the Fighting Irish
held Michigan State to just
three points and its prolific run-
ning back, Le'Veon Bell, to just

77 yards. After watching film
of that game, Hoke said he was
surprised by the ability of Notre
Dame's front seven, led by one
of the nation's best linebackers,
Manti Te'o.
"You knew they were good,"
Hoke said. "But they were really
good."
The game could again hinge
on Michigan's ability to find
continuity - typically, Robin-
son struggles when he doesn't.
Against the Fighting Irish
last year, he gained 338 yards
through the air, but also threw
three interceptions and com-
pleted less than half of his
passes. He struggled similarly
against Alabama this year and
Virginia Tech in last year's
Sugar Bowl.
Enter Toussaint. It will be up
to the running back who loves to
dance to establish some rhythm.

'U' students pull prank in South Bend

Group affixes 'Beat
the Irish' banner to
stadium, raises 'M'
flag on quadrangle
By BEN ESTES and
ZACH HELFAND
Daily SportsEditors
Rivalries tend to bring the
best out of the opposing teams.
They also bring the best out of
the respective fanbases, Wvhich
was evidenced by events in
South Bend early Wednesday
morning.
According to an e-mail sent to
the Daily from someone with the
e-mail address
gobluebeat-
theirish@
gmail.com,
a group of
University wanted
students trav-
eled to Notre our p:
Dame's cam-
pus and put up M ich
a blue banner
reading "Beat -
the Irish,"
complete with a maize Block 'M'
over one of the gates of Notre
Dame Stadium.
The pranksters insisted
on anonymity, but the Daily
traced the origin of the e-mail
to University servers in Ann
Arbor.
One member said eight stu-
dents made the trip to South
Bend and another two were
involved in planning.

The anonymous Michigan
studnt claimed the group had
little difficulty scaling the gate,
and once inside, they used zip
ties to secure the banner.
"The ironic part is that there
were some Notre Dame students
camped out on the other side
of the stadium to protect it, but
we came through the campus
rather than from the road, so
they didn't see us coming," one
member said ina separate email.
"The hardest part was making
sure there was no one around ...
when we went to put up the ban-
ner, because there was absolute-
ly no cover to hide behind as we
hung it, and it is directly across
from one of the main campus
libraries."
The group
also claimed
they raised
e just a Michigan
flag on a flag-
to show pole in one of

"With little lighting we
couldn't get a great picture," the
member continued. "Regard-
less, it was well worth it know-

ly manicured gardens of South

Hoke no longer surprised
by Robinson's athleticism
By STEPHENJ. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor

It really takes something spe-
cial to impress Michigan coach
Brady Hoke these days.
Late in the second quarter
on Saturday, with the Michigan
football team (2-1) leading Mas-
sachusetts 28-10, senior quar-
terback Denard Robinson took a
shotgun snap and stepped back
to survey the coverage downfield.
He pump-faked once, then again
before escapingthe pocket.
Robinson pumped again as he
angled toward the sideline, then
he decided on a different course of
action. On his 12th step, Robinson
planted his right foot and pivoted
90 degrees to his right.
Without missing a stride, Rob-
inson bolted back across the field,
leaving two diving defenders in
his wake, and then outran every-
one to the pylon. The box score
called it a 36-yard touchdown,
though Robinson ran closer to
twice that number.
All told, the play took 15 sec-
onds for Robinson to shake an
entire defense.
It was the 90-degree turn that
had people talkingthis week.
"He checked all his reads, sat
in the pocket as long as he could,
and then when he broke out he
went and made a right-angle cut
- I've never seen anyone make a
right-angle cut directly the oppo-
site way they were going without
falling," said junior wide receiver
Devin Gardner on Monday.
"I told him, 'You're the best
player I've ever seen,' after he
came off. ... There's not much you
can say after you see that."
But it's much harder to sur-
prise Hoke.
"I'm sure there's going to be
something that happens during
a practice or a game that you say,
'Man, I didn't know you could
throw itacross your bodythat far,'
or, 'He stopped on a dime here and
accelerated so fast,' Hoke said.
What about that 90-degree cut
- that was unexpected, right?
"No, not really," Hoke said.
"Because (the Michigan defense)
chasedhimaround the firstspring.
We were chasing him all over and
when I knew we were coming
around a little bit defensively, he
said, 'You know, a year ago I could
run wherever I wanted against our
defense. Now I can't.'
"So I mean, that was a year
ago. That's kind of as good as an
endorsement as anythingthat our
guys are understanding getting to

Senior quarterback Denard Robinson has stunned Notre Dame two years in a

the football."
Though Hoke and offensive
coordinator Al Borges both con-
tend that Robinson needs to have
success through the air in Michi-
gan's hybrid pro-style offense
against No. 11 Notre Dame this
Saturday, there's no question that
Robinson's running ability has
helped Michigan in its two wins
this far this season.
Robinson ran just 10 times in
the season opener against then-
No. 2 Alabama - he ran justtwice
in the first half alone - collecting
just27yards. Since then, he'sbeen
let loose in the ground game. He
had 20 rushing attempts for 218
yards against Air Force a week
later and 10 carries for 106 yards
in three quarters against Massa-
chusetts last week.
There have been more designed
quarterback runs and an empha-
sis on read options, but Robinson
is also tasked with making snap
decisions as the pocket collapses
around him: Hold onto the ball or
take off?
Hoke said Robinson in general
makes the right decision.

"I'm pretty much OK 99 per-
cent of the time, tucking it and
taking it," Hoke said. "He's got
such a gift, you know, that most of
the time when he plants his foot
and decidesto go north and south,
it's going to be pretty productive
with you, so I'm very comfortable
with that."
The ticking clock in the pocket
changes from game to game. Rob-
inson couldn't buy any time for
three quarters against the Fight-
ing Irish last season - "They
boxed him in a couple different
ways with backers and a safety,"
Hoke said - but he exploded in
the fourth quarter of Michigan's
last-second 35-31 victory.
He finished with 338 yards and
four touchdowns on11-of-24 pass-
ing and 108 rushing yards and a
rushing touchdown on16 carries.
Though that game was just
Robinson's second start under
Hoke and in the new offensive
system, the performance didn't
surprise Hoke.
"I've been aroundhimenough,"
Hoke said. "It's not shocking or
surprising."

aboard the now-empty sailboat,
she realizes there's only one thing
left for her to do: Leave Eric and
start life abroad.
Five months later, Juniper is
happily adjusting to life in Monte
Carlo, when a mysterious letter
arrives to jar her back to her pre-

It all started the day Juniper
Haze decided to go sailing. She
wasn't particularly fond of water
or sails, but when dreamy Eric
Ritter asked her to jump on his
father's sailboat and sail away
with him, of course Juniper
agrees. She wanted mystery, love,
swimming with dolphins. Instead
she got a face full of sea foam as
she was catapulted overboard
during a drunken night of sailing,
right after the two got hitched in a
small, port-city-based ceremony.
Now Juniper is stuck in the
middle of the ocean, white dress
and all. After floating on her back
for a few hours, Juniper comes to
the realization that everything
in her life has always felt a little
like drowning: Her broken fam-
ily, with a cliched alcoholic for a

father and an avoidance-prone
mother, didn't provide for a good
childhood. Her best friend, Lilly,
was prettier, more accomplished
and better at her job than June.
Everything was a struggle, even
her 13-hour marriage to Eric, who
was currently searching aimlessly
around the ocean for his wife.
It was there, in the 13th hour,
that Juniper decided to turn her
life around. And that's when it
happened: the worst thing she's
ever done. She didn't mean to do
it - as soon as she saw Eric com-
ing towards her, green as the
seaweed, Juniper panicked and
dove underwater, surfacing 100
feet away, watching Eric scream
her name. Juniper wasn't sure
what made her do it, but just as
she was planning on yelling back,

At Weber's,

the dishes

EUREKA.
Understanding creativity
Honors 252 links

uring the school year -
as I indefatigably tread
water, trying to stay
afloat in a sea of papers, proj-
ects, exams - I must admit that
my desire
to stray far
from campus
is minimal.
I mean, why
drive to Pita
Pita in Ypsi
when I can
gorge myself NATHAN
on toum WOOD
and pita at
La Marsa
on State Street? Sushi at Saica?
Meh, Sadako's closer.
But during the summer, my
motivation to explore beyond
the little area my laziness usu-
ally confines me to increases,
opening up cool things to do in
the wonderful city of Ann Arbor.
Note: When I say, "cool things,"
I'm really saying, "a slew of new,
awesome restaurants to try out."
And outside of summer, could
there be a better time to seek out
those new, awesome restaurants
than during Ann Arbor Restau-
rant Week? I think not.
At the top of my list this time
around is Weber's Restaurant.
First piquing my interest in the
place was my naive presumption
that it was associated with the
elite brand of grills bearing the
same name. I've repeatedly seen
bright, shiny billboards adver-
tising its outwardly modern
architecture (think Ross minus
the overbearing glitz), and I've
driven past it many a time on
the way to the movie theater.
On this one fateful night, I also
happened to be in the mood for a
nice prime rib.
So as our reservation time
comes and goes, my friends and I
entertain ourselves at the piano
bar - an elegant touch appropri-
ate for an elegant restaurant. Our
names are called after a moder-
ate wait, and soon we are pull-
ing up to a solid, cocoa brown
walnut table and similarly con-
structed, rugged - yet comfort-
able - chairs. As I look around,
I'm immediately surprised by the
unusual fusion of modern and
Bavarian architecture, the latter
of which the building's exterior
is now, after a recent renovation,
completely devoid. Thin, pasty
birch twigs decoratively skirt the
median of one wall, contrasting
nicely with the restrained colors
staining choice panes of glass
opposite them. On the remaining
wall space hangs what I will only
generically describe as a big vari-
ety of good artwork. The place is
classy, sophisticated, warm.
Our waiter first delivers a
basket of bread, for which I'm
never able to contain my excite-
ment. The carbs of the evening
include good quality, soft white
rolls (that truthfully could be
warmer), crusty homemade gar-
lic bread and tasteless, clearly
mass-produced matzah. An ivory
slab of cold, salty butter and a
stingy scoop of disappointingly

fishy salmon pte are served
alongside. I'm not outrageously
impressed, nor totally under-
whelmed.
Our appetizers range from
delectable to embarrassingly
not. Leading in taste is the escar-
got, whose texture is rendered
perfectly resilientcyet creamy
through precise preparation.
Simply flavored with butter,
lemon, parsley and a splash of
cognac, this dish is a real pleaser.
Unlike the snails, however, I find
the liberal helping of mussels I'm
served to be merely mediocre.
Though the shellfish are smooth
on the tongue, their lack of gar-
lic and salt is blaringly evident.
And even worse, on the "embar-
rassing" end of the spectrum, is
the restaurant's spinach bread.
Everything about this dish tastes
cheap: the Parmesan (grocery
shelf-standard), the mozzarella
(ordered pre-shredded in a bag,
I'm sure), the spinach (as freshly
wilted as a defrosted block
from the freezer) and the bread
(where's the nearest day-old dis-
count bakery?). I'm pretty sure
my six-year-old cousin made this
same dish for me last summer,
only better.
Seriously? This
is your spinach
bread?
The only other comment I
have regardingthe establish-
ment's pre-entre offerings
is that chopped romaine and
bottled dressing does not a salad
make.
But I'm still hopeful for my
prime rib. Since this has been
Weber's House Specialty since
1950, I expect the beef to melt
in my mouth. I'm served twelve
ounces (a hefty portion) in a
pool of salty au jus. And while
I can't say it's the most tender
prime rib I've ever cut into, it
does exhibit good marbling,
deep flavor and is cooked rarely,
as I asked for - which is some-
times hard to come by late in
the evening.
The last note of our dinner is
a sweet one, a cannoli with fruit
sauce. Unfortunately, this note
falls flat, as the shell has long lost
its satisfying crunch and, with it,
any sliver of an exceptional qual-
ity: bland, boring, common.
Overall, the quality of the food
here is brilliantly outshined by
the intriguing decor, a common
casualty of poor restaurant man-
agement: It's clearly more about
the experience than the food.
So, while filling and - during
restaurant week - a good value,
Weber's may be somethingto try
out, but definitely not something
to brag about.
Wood is still searching for
that prime rib. To help, e-mail

There's little to be seen or
heard in the Undergraduate Sci-
ence Building after 7 p.m. on a
Wednesday. Vacuums are the
most prominent obstruction in
the otherwise empty, serene cor-
ridors of the building, closely
followed by the heaving steps of
tired students heading out for
dinner or another round of cof-
fee at Starbucks.
But if you stood on the top
floor of the USB last Wednesday,
you would have heard something
almost profound amid the vacu-
ums and footsteps. You would
have caught snippets of a discus-
sion about meditation, creativ-
ity, consciousness and the nature
of knowledge, briefly interceded
by the sound of a flugelhorn (a
trumpet-like instrument from
Germany).
You would have been
intrigued, then perplexed, then
amazed. You would have stood
in front of the classroom emit-
ting these noises, not under-
standing why a philosophical
discussion so acutely relevant
to the students of the University
was taking place in this hidden
corner of campus in late hours of
the evening.
The discussion in question
was one of many that will take
place every other Wednesday
this semester as part of an Hon-
ors 252 class, "Honors Natural
Sciences Seminar - Creativity
in the Sciences and the Arts."
Its title only skims the surface of
what this class is truly about, at
least for the casual observer. But
creativity in the sciences and
arts is a big component of what
drives most of the class discus-
sions and projects.
As part of the class, one pro-
fessor from the sciences and
one professor from the arts or
humanities talk about their
"Eureka moment" - the forces
that drove them to pursue their
respective careers and why
they're passionate about doing
what they do. This discussion
focuses on how creativity, and
the convergence of science and
art, plays a part in their careers.
In previous semesters, stu-
dents themselves have examined
unusual and intriguing examples
of how science and art converge
in everyday life - from creating
projects based on the measure-
ments and ratios required in the
production of a cupcake, to film-
ing themselves painting their
own walls using time-lapse pho-
tography.
Biological Chemistry Prof.
Stephen Ragsdale has taught
this class nearly every semester
since Fall 2009. Each week, the
class alternates between semi-
nar and workshop - where the
talks from the previous week are
further discussed to familiarize
students with their classmates,
but mostly, according to Rags-
dale, with themselves.
"(In the workshops) personal
things get revealed and students
start to trust each other," Rags-

Honors 252 features a bi-weekly guest lecturer to discuss their research.

dale said. "Over time, the class
becomes a safe zone for people
to explore new things and make
themselves vulnerable."
With 27 students, small class
size is perhaps the best way to
go for a class that relies primar-
ily on roundtable discussions.
Ragsdale explained that Honors
classes usually hover around 20
people, and despite being asked
to expand, he wants to stick to
his tried-and-tested class for-
mat.
But what about creativity
calls for a class to be devoted
to it? Creativity seems like a
strange concept to teach, if it can
be taught at all. In the Univer-
sity alone, it's not uncommon for
many science-minded students
to think that what they do either
has nothing to do with the arts
or requires a far superior intel-
lect, an illusion Ragsdale said his
class aims to dissolve.
"I had an interest in science as
well as the arts," he said. "I have
a feeling thatthey're actually not
that different. They offer differ-
ent views of reality, but there are
a lot of convergent principles.
"Over the time I've been
teaching this class, I wanted
to bring together scientists
and artists to speak together in
one classroom so that students
could ask: 'Is what (Professor
Stephen) Rush doing in his jazz
fundamentally different from
what (Professor) Henry Pol-
lack is doing when he's study-
ing climate change? Are they
fundamentally different ways of
viewing the world? Or do we just
have certain preferences?'"
A student of the sciences him-
self, Ragsdale is no stranger to
being bored by traditional sci-
ence classes. He says it's one of
the reasons he started the course
after its successful three-year
run at his previous post at the
University of Nebraska, Lincoln.
"I don't consider that science
is dry. I think it's a very cre-
ative field. We're always trying
to build puzzles, and the cool
thing is that they're puzzles of
our own mental construction,"
Ragsdale said.
But he also believes that
before experimenting and get-

ting creative with science, you
need to understand its basic fun-
damentals - a process that may
not be easy nor engaging.
"I think that's it's a matter of
what we think is most important
for (a) student to learn ... when
you learn piano, they don't just
say 'go and create this piece.' It's
first learning how to play, put-
ting your finger on some keys.
It's very didactic," Ragsdale said.
Yet regardless of the class
type, Ragsdale believes profes-
sors should find the right bal-
ance of "thinking and doing."
He uses various unusual teach-
ing methods in his own classes
to increase the students' input
into their own learning. He
allows them to develop rules on
the length and grading scales
of essays and projects, claim-
ing that students usually pick a
tougher workload for themselves
than he would think to assign.
"I think we just spend too
much time teaching students
facts and giving them tests on
factual matters rather than ask-
ing the deep question," Ragsdale
said. "If all you do in a class is
present lectures and give tests, I
think that's adverse to develop-
ing creative ideas."
Science isn't the only sub-
ject often considered less than
thrilling. Edward Sarath, guest
lecturer in Honors 252 and a
professor in the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance, encountered a
similar problem when he joined
his department in 1987.
"The School of Music in Mich-
igan was, and still is, largely
classical - that means, all the
music has been composed by
European composers who died
two centuries ago. When you
go to the Art school, it would be
unthinkable to not create your
own artwork. But in music, the
norm is: 'thou shalt not create,'
because we already have all this

great music," he said, during the
first Honors 252 lecture of the
semester.
Sarath now teaches jazz and
contemporary improvisation at
the University. He spoke of many
facets of creativity during his
guest lecture, specifically that
we're at a moment in time when
creativity is crucial to solving
the problems humanity is facing.
He added that students need to
condition their consciousness to
meet the challenge.
"The history of science is a
history of deep, deep thinkers.
The innovative scientist is going
far beyond the notion of conven-
tional science and transcending
the mainstream," Sarath said.
The students enrolled in this
class come from backgrounds
as diverse as business and math,
but almost all of them already
share a love for the sciences
and the arts. Amanda Harris, a
sophomore in the Ross School of
Business, said the multi-dimen-
sional aspect of Ragsdale's class
echoed her own personality.
"I'm taking this class because
I'm a very multi-dimensional
person. I like all the different
academic fields so I think it's
very interesting how he's blend-
ing two that you often think are
contradicting, because that's
also kind of howI see the world,"
Harris said.
Whether graduates of Honors
252 continue to be creative, have
"Eureka moments" or change
the world is yet to be deter-
mined. But it's clear that the
class poses some important and
complex questions, which Rags-
dale hopes will be enough.
"People always write that
they want to keep being creative
in whatever they do in their
lives," he said. "So I hope that
happens, I feel like it should hap-
pen, but we just get bogged down
in things sometimes."

Interpreting the image
In the five years since the Uni-
versity acquired Thom's Great
Moments in Medicine, Gifts of
Art Director Elaine Sims has been
busy, as she described it, "finding
homes" for the 45 paintings. Her
two main concerns were security
of the artwork - achievedbypro-
tective museum glass and a lock-
ing system that mounts art to the
wall - and how to install the art
throughout the medical campus
in a meaningful way.
Because the series was gifted
to the UMHS, it was intended to
be put on display for the public
within that environment. Sims
described the difficulties of hang-
ing public art, especially in a hos-
pital setting.
"It's always a challenge," she
said, "Because in a hospital, art
has a job to do. It can't just sit on
the wall and look pretty ... You
have no idea what people are
experiencing as they're going
through (the halls). As many as
10,000 people a day walk by any
piece of artwork and they have to
understand it immediately, they
can't work at it. It's not a moment
to educate or cause discomfort."
Working through the chal-
lenges a hospital environment
can create, Sims installed 11 of
Thom's Great Moments in Medi-
cine paintings on the walls of the
UMHS, including some at the
facility's main entrance and more
near the Ford Amphitheater.
Paintings from the series that
might alarm hospital patients
were hung elsewhere. Fifteen
were placed on the second floor
of the Taubman Health Sciences
Library and, as Sims noted, the
most iconic (and bloody) pieces
were hung outside the South
Lecture Hall in Medical Sci-
ence Building II. This decision
was made so that the medical
students using this lecture hall
would be able to interact with the
artworks.
However, medical students
aren't the only ones to observe

COURTESY OF GIFTS OF ART

Images from Robert Thom's series depict medical practices from all around the world.

Great Moments in Medicine
series are seen as especially mis-
leading: "Primitive Medicine"
and "J. Marion Sims: Gynecologic
Surgeon." The first depicts a top-
less Native American woman
being healed within a wooden
structure, surrounded by mem-
bers of her community. Though
nothing about the painting seems
"primitive," Thom problemati-
cally titled this artwork as such.
The second depicts J. Marion
Sims - known as the father of
American gynecology - and two
white men surrounding an Afri-
can American woman perched on
a table, while two African Ameri-
can women watch from behind a
curtain. The scene is supposed to
celebrate Sims' cure of vesicovag-
inal fistula, a condition women
experience during traumatic
labor. This piece fails to reflect,
however, that Sims was only able
to make his discovery due to fre-
quent human experimentation on
enslaved women.
Neither of these paintings are
currently on display.
As Sims explained, she is

searching for "a place where peo-
ple are prepared to see something
like that and have a discussion."
Until then, they will remain in
the University of Michigan Muse-
um of Art's storage facility.
For Howell, these biases and
prejudices are an important angle
to study and think about in terms
of the history of medicine, and
how that history is written.
"They depicted an image of
medicine and an idea of medicine
that has already passed," How-
ell said. "These paintings show
doctors as deities, almost - who
you might want to be if you were
a medical student or deeply want
to be cared for by if you were a
potential patient."
"They're a snapshot of how, at
a particular time and a particu-
lar place, this was the history of
medicine," he added. "We are not
at that time or place anymore,
and if we were to hire someone to
depict the history of medicine, it
would look very different."
Always looking back

In spite of the potentially
controversial nature of some of
Thom's works, Sims maintains
that the art remains extremely
popular. She continues to receive
requests for use of the images in
publications and to tour the col-
lection.
Perhaps this lingering affec-
tion for Robert Thom and his
Great Moments in Medicine
series is because, to the gen-
eration that grew up with them,
they are, as Sims described, "old
friends."
"They mean different things to
different people," Kelch said. "To
medical students, I hope that they
give them a sense of where medi-
cine was and how far we've come.
And also, how little we know
today. There's so much more to
learn. For the public, I hope it
gives them a sense of the tremen-
dous change that has occurred."
"We have a way of repeating
ourselves," he added. "Hopefully
by learning about history this
way and studying the past, we can
be more- modest, more humble
and better physicians."
