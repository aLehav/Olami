Michigan 
Movement, 
a 
University of Michigan student 
organization, held their annual 
Project Connect event this Sunday. 
Project Connect is a six-hour long 
event modeled after Tent City in 
Toledo, Ohio. The event brings 
together University students and 
volunteers with members of the 
Ann Arbor homeless community 
to build relationships and provide 
resources. 
Founded by Business graduate 
student Hussain Ali and Public 
Health graduate student Payton 
Watt in 2017 when they were 
undergraduates, 
Michigan 
Movement operates as the only 
student organization on campus 
dedicated to providing aid to 
those impacted by poverty and 
homelessness in Ann Arbor. The 
organization highlights working 
with the community rather than 

for the community, a mission that 
is conveyed throughout Project 
Connect.
The event was broken up into 
various stations, starting with a 
check-in station where members 
of the homeless community filled 
out forms asking for their name, 
housing 
status, 
basic 
medical 
information and services they 
would be utilizing throughout the 
event. 
The next station provided MIM 
kits, the cornerstone of Michigan 
Movement’s mission. MIM kits are 
care packages filled with everyday 
necessities. The kits include items 
such as oral hygiene supplies, 
deodorant, flashlights and blankets. 
Free water bottles collected from 
the Intramural Sports building and 
the Central Campus Recreational 
Building which had been sanitized 
by University dining halls were also 
available as a part of the kit.

The first ever Israel Summit 
at Michigan drew about 100 
students 
and 
community 
members to the Ross School 
of Business Sunday morning 
for 
an 
event 
highlighting 
Israeli 
innovation 
and 
entrepreneurship. The summit 
opened 
with 
accomplished 
speakers in diverse industries 
including entrepreneur tech 
influencer Inbal Arieli and 
Sivan 
Ya’ari,

Business 
senior 
Nikki 
Hassan, who helped organize 
the event, said she was thrilled 
with the speaking lineup.
“It made us so happy, the 
willingness of people to come 
and share the positive ways 
that Israel’s innovation and 
technology impact the rest of 
the world,” Hassan said. 
LSA senior Nadav Neuman, 
who attended the summit, 
commented on the importance 
of Israeli innovations. 
“It’s a small country that 
has had a huge impact on the 
world as we know it, so it’s 
important to learn about it in 
that sense,” Neuman said.

André Aciman, author of the 
novel “Call Me By Your Name,” 
spoke to more than 400 people in 
Rackham Auditorium on Saturday 
night. Aciman’s new novel “Finding 
Me,” is the sequel to “Call My By 
Your Name,” which was adapted 
into an award-winning film in 2017. 
The event, sponsored and hosted 
by Literati Bookstore, included a 
Q&A and book signing following 
a 
discussion 
with 
Rackham 
Merit Fellow and writer Zahir 
Janmohamed. 
Janmohamed started off the 
discussion by inquiring about 
Aciman’s memoir “Out of Egypt.” 
The memoir is about Aciman’s 
upbringing in Egypt, which stuck 
out to Janmohamed because of 
his own roots in Egypt. Aciman 
had to dig into his past in order to 
write that novel, he said. Aciman 
said humor helped him write about 
painful memories in “Out of Egypt.”
“Because there were parts that 
were so horrible and painful, I had 
to find a way of working around 
those painful moments,” Aciman 
said. “Usually, I did that by finding 
out or digging out some disclosed 
humor, because I think humor is a 
way in which you can communicate 
things that are very painful.

Engineering senior Ryuji Arimoto 
is on the tail end of the stressful 
cycle of medical school applications. 
After multiple rounds of online 
applications and 10 interviews, 
he’s finally started to receive 
acceptances.
But 
Arimoto’s 
hard-earned 
acceptances have come at a cost. 
Factoring in testing fees, his primary 
and 
secondary 
applications 
to 
40 different medical schools and 
the travel costs of interviewing at 

schools across the country, Arimoto 
estimated he’s already approaching 
$10,000 in total expenses, and he 
hasn’t finished the process yet.
“That’s an obscene amount of 
money,” Arimoto said. 
The pricey application process 
begins with the Medical College 
Admission Test, or the MCAT. 
According 
to 
Arimoto, 
many 
students take a prep course, which 
can cost a few thousand dollars. The 
test itself costs over $300, and it’s not 
uncommon for students to take the 
MCAT several times. 
Second-year 
University 
of 

Michigan Medical School student 
Vy Tran, a first-generation college 
graduate who identifies as someone 
from a low-income background, said 
even though MCAT preparation is 
expensive, she took a course to make 
sure she was setting herself up for 
success. 
“Medical 
school 
is 
a 
huge 
process,” Tran said. “You want to do 
everything you can, you don’t want 
to be cheap on these things.”
Next 
come 
the 
primary 
applications. 
Primaries 
are 
streamlined so students submit a 
single application package through 

the Association of American Medical 
Colleges’ online service. Students 
who applied this past cycle paid $170 
for the first school and $40 for each 
additional one. For the 2019-2020 
cycle, students applied to 17 schools 
on average, according to the AAMC. 
If 
a 
student 
meets 
the 
qualifications 
for 
a 
medical 
school, they’ll be asked to submit a 
secondary application answering 
school-specific questions. The cost of 
secondaries varies, but Arimoto said 
it’s often around $100 per school. 

U-M Museum of Natural History

The University of Michigan 
Museum of Natural History 
opened three new exhibits and 
two investigative labs to the 
public Sunday.
Funding for the new museum 
was first announced by the 
provost in 2011. In April of 
this year, the Natural History 
Museum had its grand opening 
that saw about 3,000 visitors. 
On Sunday, for its second 
opening with new exhibits, 
more 
than 
1,000 
students, 
families and local residents 

came through to explore the 
museum and get a first look at 
the new interactive exhibits 
and research stations. 
Museum 
Director 
Amy 
Harris 
gave 
The 
Daily 
a 
tour 
around 
the 
facilities, 
highlighting 
all 
the 
main 
attractions. She started off 
by talking about the new 
exhibit, Exploring Michigan, 
which 
includes 
information 
and displays on the state of 
Michigan’s 
own 
ecosystem. 
Centered at the entrance of 
Exploring Michigan is none 
other than a wolverine, an 
ode not only to the University 
but also the state, as Harris 

explained. 
“It’s 
our 
old 
taxidermy 
wolverine 
which 
we 
sent 
out to get fluffed and buffed 
and 
freshened 
up for the 
21st 
century,” 
Harris 
said. 
“Actually, wolverines may have 
never lived in Michigan, but 
they are still a symbol for the 
state because they are really 
fierce animals.”
Harris continued then to 
show the five new dioramic 
replicas 
of 
the 
ecosystems 
in Michigan, complete with 
interactive 
screens, 
wall 
displays, soundscapes in the 
background and even a cave for 
younger visitors to crawl into 

and get a closer perspective. 
“There’s 
a 
touch 
screen 
where you can learn about ice 
age features in Ann Arbor. One 
example is the Diag, which was 
a glacial outwash plain, and 
that’s why it’s so flat,” Harris 
said. 
Harris also drew attention to 
the interactives run by student 
docents dispersed throughout 
the exhibits, which allow for 
visitors of all ages to touch and 
learn about the different fossils 
and artifacts.

The U-M Medical School charges 
$85. After secondaries, Arimoto 
said his total application costs were 
already in the range of multiple 
thousands of dollars, not including 
MCAT-related fees. 
“Secondary is a cash grab,” 
Arimoto said. “Obviously, you don’t 
need a hundred dollars from every 
single applicant for them to send you, 
what, two essays?” 
Without family support, Arimoto 
said, he would have been in financial 
distress at this point in the cycle.
“Even before my interviews 
started, I would’ve just been drained 
monetarily,” Arimoto said. “There 
would have been no question about 
that.”
Steven Gay, assistant dean for 
admissions at the U-M Medical 
School, said though secondaries are 
expensive, the school-specific aspect 
makes sense. 
“Every school has its own 
secondary, and I think that’s very 
appropriate,” Gay said. “Just like 
students are looking for certain 

things in schools, we should be 
attempting to get the best students 
to succeed in our curriculum, to 
become the type of physicians we 
feel it’s our mission as an institution 
to create.”
Gay 
acknowledged 
the 
cost 
of secondaries, noting the U-M 
Medical School does try to alleviate 
it by offering fee waivers to students 
who reach out and demonstrate 
need. In addition, Gay said when 
the University began accepting a 
“people skills” test called CASPer as 
part of medical school applications, 
the Office of Admissions did not 
raise secondary fees, recognizing 
that students were now paying to 
submit those scores. 
“We’ve worked to keep our 
secondaries lower in terms of the top 
institutions,” Gay said. 
There are also some scholarships 
available through the AAMC. For 
instance, Tran said she was able to 
get 15 or 16 schools worth of primary 
and secondary application fees 
waived, covering all the schools she 
applied to. 
As a final step, qualified applicants 
hear back from medical schools with 
interview invitations. Arimoto said 

someone who applies to 20 schools 
might expect to get five interviews 
if they’re fortunate. The travel costs 
are not reimbursed. 
“If you’re lucky enough to get 
interviews, they don’t pay for your 
interviews,” Arimoto said. “If you 
have to fly out to California from 
Michigan, it’s like $500, and then 
you have to buy a hotel, that’s $200 
a night, and if you have to spend two 
nights there, then you’re already at a 
grand for one interview.”
Gay said medical schools have 
some ways of mitigating the cost 
of attending interviews. Schools 
in similar locations may try to 
coordinate 
interview 
dates 
so 
students only have to make a 
single trip. In addition, Gay said 
the U-M Medical School works to 
provide interviewees with more 
affordable 
housing, 
food 
and 
transportation options, as well as 
travel reimbursements for some 
applicants.
“We 
tend 
to 
give 
travel 
reimbursement for our students 
who are low-income so that it’s 
not an issue to travel,” Gay said. 
“We have an extensive program 
where students can stay with other 
students on their visits and aren’t 
paying for places to stay.” 
Tran 
received 
a 
$200 
reimbursement from the University 
to support her interview. She 
also tried to offset travel costs by 
grouping interviews in similar 
locations. 
“I tried to group my interviews 
together,” Tran said. “There are 
things like that that you can do, but 
that being said, sometimes you don’t 
have that choice because the school 
will pick a date for you.”
Tran said hearing back from the 
University of Michigan, one of her 
top schools, by early October spared 
her the cost of additional interviews. 
In addition to seeking out schools 
that offer a quick turnaround, 
she said applicants should think 
carefully about what schools are 
truly a good match, rather than just 
applying to as many as possible. 
“There are some people who 
don’t need to apply to that many, 
and there will be people applying 
to schools that are not a good fit for 
them,” Tran said. “Just think about 
what the school’s values are.”
Gay echoed Tran’s sentiments, 

noting 
the 
“one-size-fits-all” 
primary application, which allows 
prospective medical students to 
apply online to dozens of schools at 
once, may encourage people to apply 
to more schools than necessary. He 
said applicants should narrow down 
which schools actually match their 
interests. For instance, some schools 
might better prepare students for 
medical research, while others 
might fit students aspiring to become 
primary-care physicians.
“Part of applying to medical 
school, 
just 
like 
applying 
to 
undergrad, is the onus of when it’s 
easy to apply to all of them, you just 
apply to all of them,” Gay said. “There 
is responsibility on the student to be 
an informed consumer with some 
discretion, saying, these are actually 
the things I want.” 
Gay said increasing the number 
of schools one applies to doesn’t 
necessarily improve the chances 
of getting an interview. Medical 
schools have specific criteria, so Gay 
said applicants need to be honest 
with themselves about what schools 
they are likely to be accepted to.
“The application process isn’t a 
lucky thing,” Gay said. “Students 
do the very best they can to prepare 
themselves to be the best candidates 
for medical school. But once they 
have done that, it’s important 
to assess what you look like as a 
candidate and have others with 
experience frankly assess what your 
candidacy looks like.” 
One thing medical schools can 
do to help applicants make educated 
choices, Gay said, is to be open with 
pre-med advisers and prospective 
students about what requirements 
and values they’re looking for in an 
applicant. 
“All of us, as medical schools, 
should be transparent in our 
processes,” Gay said. “We should 
be very open with letting students 
know how we are trying to assist 
them, knowing that finances can be a 
significant barrier to the application 
process. 
But 
students, 
equally, 
should work hard to pick schools 
they feel they have not only the best 
opportunity of getting into but fit 
who they wish to be.”

MEDICINE
From Page 1A


In the era of Megan Thee 
Stallion and Cardi B, it can 
be easy to assume that Black 
women want to learn how to 
dance like them. I’ll admit, 
it can be fun learning the 
newest dance to a hit song in 
the comfort and privacy of 
your home with your friends. 
However, the situation that I 
am about to describe serves a 
reminder of how stereotyping 
that all Black women can 
dance a certain way can be 
debilitating.
Recently I attended a party 
with one of my friends who 
is also an African American 
young woman. Although it 
didn’t bother me, we were the 
only visibly Black women in 
the room. When we arrived 
at the party we befriended 
two girls who are not Black 
which was fun at first, but 
then the party got boring. As 
soon as the party began to 
die down, the two girls who 
were supposed to be our new 
friends kept pressuring us 
to “shake our a**.” At first 
I thought it was funny, but 
when they continued to do it, 
I felt peer pressure to actually 
dance in a way that I don’t feel 
very comfortable with. After 
that I felt very compelled to 
leave the party.
It is known by my friends 
that I am not comfortable 

dancing like that, and luckily 
my friend that I was with took 
over and stole the attention 
away from me. I was able to 
stay at the party until it got 
shut down, but the situation 
that occurred never escaped 
my mind. What if I was 
there by myself and someone 
pressured me to dance like 
that? I think that I probably 
would have done it. There 

aren’t any words to describe 
what goes through your mind 
when you are being pressured 
in that way. It’s like you lose 
the ability to say “no” or “I 
don’t want to.” It was an 
experience that I hope to 
never have again. I think that 
if Black women weren’t held 
to stereotypes such as being 
able to twerk, we would be 
able to feel more comfortable 
admitting that we listen to 
certain types of music or 
actually enjoy certain things 
that are considered outside of 
the “norm.”

And then year after year, we 
will mourn the loss of what we 
used to have 
And then year after year, we 
will reminisce about the times 
she had provided us with all of 
her beauty 
And then year after year, we 
will live to see our future die, 
right in front of our eyes

When most people think 
about the new HBO show, 
“Euphoria”, 
it’s 
often 
categorized as a racy high 
school television show that 
brings 
you 
into 
the 
lives 
of 
teenagers 
dealing 
with 
problems such as substance 
addiction, identity, sex, and 
of 
course, 
daddy 
issues. 
Although these themes are at 
the forefront of the show, and 
they definitely hit you like a 
ton of bricks right off the bat, 
I can’t help but be pulled in 
by the interracial queer love 
story between the two main 
characters, Rue and Jules.
Seventeen 
year 
old 
Rue, 
played by Zendaya, is our 
protagonist and narrator. As 
her character navigates her 
struggle with drug addiction 
and sobriety, she meets and 
falls in love with the new girl 
at school, Jules, played by 
Hunter Schafer. Both complex 
and 
intriguing 
characters, 
their two worlds collide and 
they discover their friendship 
which develops into something 
more. Despite the fact that this 
storyline is very cliche, writer 
and director Sam Levison does 
an amazing job of portraying it 
in a way that feels refreshing 
and enlightening, even drawing 
from personal experiences of 
his battle with drug addiction. 

(He is now fourteen years 
clean.)
Of course, there have been 
similar relationships on TV 
before, such as Santana and 
Britney from Glee, a high 
school couple who played a 
major role in expanding the 
portrayal of interracial queer 
love to mainstream media.
I think it’s fair to say that 
most 
representations 
of 
LGBTQ+ people in relationships 
focus 
on 
the 
struggles 
of 
coming out or dealing with 
homophobic loved ones. These 
stories are important to have 
on-screen because it is a reality 
for a lot of queer folx. On the 
other hand, we need stories 
about queer couples that don’t 
focus solely on their sexual 
orientation but also branch out 
to show how LGBTQ+ people 
navigate the struggles that all 
teenagers in high school face, 
such as unrequited love. This 
is what makes Rue and Jules’s 
relationship unique. Rue simply 
falls in love with someone who 
doesn’t love her in the same 
way. It’s a story that is relatable 
for many but it’s so refreshing 
to see it portrayed through a 
queer lens.
It could be possible that 
writers feel the need to explain 
the complexities of sexuality 
and gender, but there’s also 
power in letting things be. 
We never see Rue come out 
to 
her 
mom, 
despite 
only 

previously being with guys 
nor do we see Jules tell Rue 
and 
other 
classmates 
that 
she’s transgender. In many 
cases, I don’t believe those 
conversations need to be had on 
screen, and some people even 
believe they aren’t necessary 
at all. Teenagers should be able 
to live freely without having to 
label themselves.
What’s also cool about the 
show is that the relationship 
that we see unfold is also 
interracial. 
It 
further 
represents the fact that Black 
LGBTQ+ folx exist and their 
stories 
exist 
with 
equal 
importance to white LGBQT+ 
folx. Rue’s life is complicated 
and challenging but, still, her 
character arc is not primarily 
focused on her racial identity. 
Her Blackness isn’t magnified 
or stereotypical, it just is what 
it is.
New interpretations of queer 
relationships 
are 
important 
and a big step in the direction 
of more inclusive media. I 
hope the story of Rue and 
Jules inspires more writers 
and casting directors to think 
outside of current Hollywood 
standards 
and 
bring 
more 
diverse, 
intersectional 
portrayals to light. Euphoria 
is an exciting and emotionally-
inspiring show to watch, and I 
can’t wait to see what season 
two has in store for Rue and 
Jules. (#rules4eva)

Life is a little less funny

“Cause my love goes BANG 
BANG BANG!” 
Tuesday night, many John 
Witherspoon fans felt their hearts 
go bang bang bang. The world 
receives heartbreaking news that 
the legendary actor and comedian 
John Witherspoon had passed 
away. John was only 77. News 
took several celebrities by shock. 
No one wanted to believe the man 
they called “Pops,” or “Granddad,” 
had passed on.
When well celebrated actors 
such as John Witherspoon pass, I 
always ask myself, “Why does this 
hurt so much?” 
The answer is simple. The loss 
of any Black icon hurts. It’s one 
less person we look up to in the 
world and one less image of Black 
representation on TV. Another 
person that looks like you, talks 
like you, understands you, or even 
made it out of the same turmoil 
you endured, is gone.
That’s what hurts. 
I remember when I first heard 
John Witherspoon’s voice echoing 
from my TV. I was a child and 
it seemed like I heard his voice 
before I actually saw him pop up 
on the screen. In the beginning, 
I wondered, “Who is this crazy 
man talking like this?”
But that was the beauty of it. 
John left a legacy that would 
never 
be 
forgotten 
simply 
because his sound, his voice, 
and his comedic ways were left 
unmatched. Whenever I heard 
John Witherspoon’s voice, I could 

easily identify him. He had a 
distinct tone and you didn’t even 
need to hear the lines, “Don’t go 
in there for about 35, 45 minutes.” 
You just knew it was him. 
He meant something to the 
Black community. Like several 
iconic Black figures, he was 
needed during a time when 
Hollywood was notorious for 
crafting films centered around 
stereotypes and producing films 
with black people as perpetrators. 
With beloved bodies of work 
like Friday, The Wayans Bros, 
and 
The 
Boondocks, 
John 
blessed us with comedic Black 
dad 
representation, 
but 
also 
taught us valuable lessons. He 
didn’t embody the stereotypical 
narrative that Hollywood likes to 
push, and he wasn’t a perpetrator 
or a victim. He was a dad who just 
was and just lived. 
John created his own flare 
with every character he played, 
he embodied originality, and 
that was something that was 
needed in the black community. 
His characters shined in a light 
of relatability, and reflected a 
sense of connection. I remember 
watching Friday as a child and 
hearing the lines, “Everytime I’m 
in the kitchen, you in the kitchen.” 
Those words lingered in my house 
growing up and to this day. It 
was something I never stopped 
hearing my mom say, and to this 
day, I’m always in the kitchen 
when she’s in the kitchen. John’s 
character’s voiced the beauty of 
our community and he said things 
that several people grew up with. 
With all the comedy in the world, 
he included Black culture in his 

work. He kept his community 
close. 
John’s exaggerated characters 
and physical comedy weren’t 
what made him unforgettable. 
He took advantage of quiet 
moments and blessed our screens 
with valuable wisdom. It wasn’t 
loud and silly, it slipped through 
quietly, soft, and raw. He was the 
kind of TV dad that mastered both 
comedy and life. “You win some, 
you lose some, but you still live 
to fight another day,” was a line 
he recited in Friday, when he saw 
his son Craig holding a gun that 
he bought for protection. This 
scene was important for the Black 
community, specifically because 
Hollywood 
had 
normalized 
the portrayal of Black men 
and violence. John’s voice rang 
through the character Willie, as 
he taught his son that you didn’t 
need a gun for protection nor does 
it make you a man. 
The jokes that danced from 
John’s 
mouth 
were 
always 
followed by a lesson. I remember 
when he scolded Craig in Friday 
for not wanting to eat his cereal 
without milk. As a child I found 
the scene hysterically funny, but 
in the midst of it all, I felt it. The 
scene wasn’t just for kicks and 
giggles, his character reminded 
a younger generation of their 
privileges––having food on the 
table. I even remember Willie 
making Craig eat the dry cereal. 
He made a valuable lesson funny 
and lighthearted. And when I 
think about pouring cereal, it’s 
ingrained in my mind to always 
check if we have milk.
His role in Friday was so 

important 
to 
Black 
culture 
because it pushed back against 
the stereotype of laziness. He was 
a hardworking family man trying 
to do right by his son and although 
the movie was filled with jokes, 
one message rang clear: every 
parent wants the best for their 
child, no matter how old they 
are. Throughout Friday, Willie 
constantly pushes his son to do 
better and take responsibility not 
only for his actions, but his life. 
The major lesson Willie tried to 
teach his son was hard work and 
the true meaning behind being a 
man. 
His embodiment of relatable 
characters 
with 
goofy 
and 
charismatic tactics is a timeless 
force in the Black community. 
John didn’t just touch the hearts 
of people who grew up with 
him. His legacy lives on from 
my mama who doesn’t want me 
in the kitchen while she’s in the 
kitchen, to the 21 year old me that 
still enjoys hearing Witherspoon’s 
voice shine through “Granddad” 
from The Boondocks, and to my 
9 year old niece whose favorite 
movie is Friday.
John Witherspoon is not only 
mourned for his death, but the 
death of an era, and the loss of 
representation. He taught us that 
life will give you cereal with no 
milk, but you still have to eat it 
and that you may fail, but living to 
see another day is one of the most 
triumphant things you can do. 
In a statement issued the day he 
died, his family said, “John used 
to say ‘I’m no big deal,’ but he was 
a huge deal to us.” He really was. 

Comfort in the abyss

Year after year
Queer Representation 
in Euphoria ‘Rules’

The clock ticks and ticks. My 
eyes are lasered onto the small 
hand as it approaches 9. I can’t 
afford to continue looking at it, 
but I can’t look away. Feeling 
every second that passes, my 
body reacts with a fidget, a leg 
shake or that creeping angst. 
In front of me: a laptop open to 
too many tabs, two books with 
scattered highlighting and all 
of my notebooks filled with 
lead to the brim. It’s midterm 
season and the misery in the air 
confirms it. My calendar is full 

of steep assignments, but I also 
have tests and classes per usual. 
This 
is 
without 
mentioning 
extracurriculars, my internship, 
and attempting to hold together 
some sort of a regular human 
life. It seems as if so much is 
going on at any given moment, 
yet there is so much more I still 
need to do. Time now seems to 
pass by quicker, the clock’s ticks 
have shorter intervals, and a cold 
warmth slithers through my skin. 
My heartbeat is more noticeable, 
my breaths feel heavier and I’m 
too uneasy to keep still. What do 
I do? What do I focus on? Maybe 
I need to calm down and stop 
enthralling over my concerns. 

But I must be concerned for a 
reason. I begin pacing around 
the room, but all of this is surely 
making matters worse. I try to 
sit down and make myself work 
but I can’t. My headspace makes 
me claustrophobic, it is void 
and silent. What do I want from 
myself? Why do I feel this way? 
There is a draining doubt and 
burning insecurity; nonetheless, 
this isn’t my first time at the 
rodeo. My third year around, 
I’ve acquired methods to tame 
my demons.
Once I began drowning in my 
thoughts, I had to learn how to 
swim.
Let us take a dive: I stop… 

and I take a second. Actually 
take a second. Then follows a 
breathe. One where the wave 
of air seeps in like a tsunami- 
strong. Like the form air takes, 
I become nothing, I think of 
nothing, absolutely nothing. It’s 
impossible, but I do it anyways. 
Next: with open arms I allow 
my embodied anxiousness to 
enter my thoughts, I greet it and 
acknowledge it. Facing it does 
not mean fighting it, each time 
I must understand that it is but 
another emotion and it is valid. 
Now I gracefully plummet and 
bask. Bask in pure gratitude, 
bask in pure appreciation, bask 
in pure realization. I think 

about those who’ve raised me, 
how much they mean to me, 
and how much I mean to them. 
I stop and think about my 
friends, the last time they left me 
laughing inexplicably, the last 
time they were the sole reason 
I felt at home. I think about the 
immediate present, the now, my 
tangible existence. I’ll be the 
first to agree that you shouldn’t 
expect somebody to pat you on 
the back for doing things you’re 
already supposed to be doing 
— but goddamnit should you 
be patting your own back any 
chance you get. 
Everyone should take that 
break when they need it, replace 

toxic habits with beneficial ones. 
We should live our lives with 
ourselves as the protagonists, 
we should be selfish, but the 
most selfless egoist there are. 
Live for our pleasures; while 
also prioritizing the pleasure of 
creating that within others. No 
other warmth comes close. And 
to you- you’re reading this, and 
you’ve come this far. If you were 
looking for that sign, here it is: 
you’re greatness. You are owed 
nothing yet deserve all you’ve 
earned. Your hard work does 
not go unnoticed, your genuine 
character does not go without 
recognition and at the end of the 
day, this will all be worth it.

Democrats cannot abandon the truth

The difference between education and indoctrination

A

t 
the 
second 
Democratic 
debate, 
when pressed to defend 
the cost of Medicare for All, 
liberal Sens. Bernie Sanders, 
I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, 
D-Mass., 
accused 
their 
more moderate opponents of 
repeating “Republican talking 
points.” 
The 
regrettable 
phrase resurfaced at the latest 
Democratic debate, when Sen. 
Amy 
Klobuchar, 
D-Minn., 
criticized Warren for dodging 
questions about the cost of her 
proposed programs.
The cost of Warren and 
Sanders’s extensive proposed 
reforms warrant scrutiny, but 
their casual dismissal of fiscal 
realities is far more disturbing. 
The exact fiscal impacts of 
Medicare for All would depend 
on the plan’s finer details, but 
any single-payer system would 
boost government expenditures 
by trillions, and a few neutral 
analyses 
predict 
total 
costs 
would increase. These are facts, 
not “Republican talking points,” 
and 
Warren 
and 
Sanders’s 
refusal to be transparent about 
the costs of their proposed 
programs is troubling.
If the progressive candidates 
continue to use the phrase 
“Republican 
talking 
points” 
to rebuff criticism, then the 
phrase could become equivalent 
to President Donald Trump’s 
mantra of “fake news.” Trump’s 
refusal to accept facts and his 
brazen denial of inconvenient 
truths is why nearly two-thirds 
of Americans believe he is 
dishonest. 
Trump’s 
untruthfulness 
is 
not a strength, and it is certainly 
not a quality Democrats should 
try to emulate. If Democrats are 
to prevail in 2020, the nominee 
must be perceived as honest, 
well-tempered and likable. These 
are all traits the public believes 
Trump lacks, and Trump’s poor 
character evaluation is a major 
reason for his dismal approval 
ratings 
among 
independents, 
who are the key demographic 
for 2020. Trump won the group 
in 2016, but their dim views of 
Trump’s character and their 
high disapproval of his job 
performance is advantageous 
for the Democratic nominee in 
2020.

However, 
this 
advantage 
assumes that the Democratic 
nominee 
is 
viewed 
more 
favorably. Trump’s character 
ratings were about as low in 
2016 as they are now, but former 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Hillary 
Clinton was also perceived as 
untrustworthy and unlikable, 
enabling Trump to overcome 
his low favorability ratings.
To avoid a repeat in 2020, the 
Democratic nominee must build 
a reputation of trustworthiness 
and authenticity, and it is fair 
to question whether Sanders 
and Warren are capable of 
this task. Aside from their 
“Republican 
talking 
points” 
line, both candidates have come 
under scrutiny for dishonesty 
and evasiveness. Sanders has 
been frequently corrected for 
repeatedly 
overstating 
U.S. 
health care costs relative to 
other developed countries, and 
his 
campaign’s 
evasiveness 
following 
his 
recent 
heart 
attack drew scrutiny. 
Warren, for her part, has 

insisted she has substantial 
Native 
American 
ancestry 
throughout her professional 
career, but a DNA test last 
year proved otherwise, forcing 
Warren to apologize to Native 
American groups and eliciting 
mockery from Trump. Warren 
also created controversy after 
claiming she was forced out of a 
teaching job for being pregnant, 
which seemed to contradict 
previous statements and board 
records.
Sanders 
and 
Warren’s 
untruthfulness reflects a larger 
trend on the progressive left in 
the Trump era. Rep. Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a leader 
of the progressive movement, 
has 
frequently 
disregarded 

the facts during her advocacy 
for progressive reforms. In 
December 2018, Ocasio-Cortez 
grossly mischaracterized the 
nature of Department of Defense 
accounting 
errors, 
claiming 
that 
the 
funds 
supposedly 
unaccounted for could have 
funded 66 percent of single-
payer health care. The claim 
was rated “Four Pinocchios” 
by the Washington Post’s fact-
checker, but when pressed on 
the claim in an interview with 
Anderson 
Cooper, 
Ocasio-
Cortez 
defended 
herself, 
saying that “there’s a lot of 
people more concerned about 
being precisely, factually and 
semantically 
correct 
than 
about being morally right.” 
Ocasio-Cortez’s defense was 
troubling — being morally and 
factually right are not mutually 
exclusive. 
Furthermore, 
her 
defense essentially excuses lies 
told for some greater purpose, 
which 
sounds 
suspiciously 
similar to the logic used by some 
Republicans to defend Trump’s 
lies.
Of course, this problem is 
not exclusive to the progressive 
wing of the Democratic Party. 
Joe Biden has come under fire 
for grossly exaggerating and 
even fabricating stories on the 
campaign trail. After factoring 
in Biden, all three Democratic 
frontrunners have spotty recent 
records when it comes to the 
truth.
This 
trend 
is 
alarming, 
since the Democrats’ greatest 
advantage against Trump is 
the president’s poor character. 
Trump has told a staggering 
13,400 lies in less than three 
years, accounting for 76 percent 
of his total public statements, 
according to PolitiFact. The 
facts are on the Democrats’ 
side – it is unnecessary and 
irresponsible to distort the 
truth. 
If 
the 
Democratic 
nominee 
cannot 
earn 
a 
perceived “character edge” over 
Trump, the president could very 
well ride the strong economy 
and his incumbency edge to 
re-election. Now is not the time 
for Democrats to abandon the 
truth.

A

re we being educated 
or indoctrinated in the 
classroom? 
Education 
stems from a fact-based and open-
minded presentation of history and 
ideas. Indoctrination is an opinion-
based presentation of those ideas. 
The average college student 
today will tell you that President 
Donald 
Trump 
has 
created 
deep divisions along party lines. 
However, studies show that the 
U.S. became increasingly more 
polarized during Barack Obama’s 
administration. I often wonder 
if this development is the effect 
of a one-sided education system 
that borders on indoctrination. 
Students and especially professors 
at a majority of colleges share more 
liberal ideologies than conservative 
ones. As a result, those who 
don’t share in these beliefs seem 
extremely different from them, and 
as a nation, we feel more polarized. 
As 
Americans, 
our 
two-party 
system has forced us to view the 
opposite party as the enemy. We 
stop listening to each other when 
we hear we’re from different sides 
of the political spectrum. In reality, 
though, we are much more similar 
than we are different. We all want 
everyone to have human rights, 
our kids to be safe in schools, legal 
immigrants to come to our country 
and to not die from a planet on fire. 
Conservatives and liberals differ in 
their strategies for attaining these 
goals, but they ultimately want the 
same things. 
It’s no secret that liberal ideas 
are threaded into our everyday lives 
— CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS, 
NYT, WAPO, public school teachers 
and most of Hollywood lean left. 
Most people also believe their 
social media leans left. Consistently, 
only one side’s strategy is given the 
spotlight. Is the only way to achieve 
the America we all want through 
Democratic candidates and their 
legislation? Are conservative points 
of view even necessary anymore? 
Conservative speakers face extreme 
public outcry on campuses if they 
try to share their views. If liberals 
have all the answers, is there really 
any need for debate? Any political 
theory course will teach you debate 
is vital to discovering the truth. 
Philosophers like John Stuart Mill 
encourage us to challenge our 
beliefs constantly with opposing 
arguments in order to refine our 

beliefs and ensure they ring valid 
and true. Some may think the 
only value in debate is to “convert” 
conservatives rather than learn 
anything from them. Today, we 
discuss our views only with those 
who reinforce them. Rallies and 
strikes have taken the place of 
discussion and compromise.
In college — precisely where we 
should experience interchange of 
thoughts and ideas free of bias — 
professors shouldn’t also lean to 
one side. However, they often reveal 
their left-leaning biases throughout 
their courses. My political science 
professors will primarily begin 
their courses by saying they won’t 
try and convince us of their political 
views. In practice, the effort often 
falls short. It’s not uncommon, for 
example, that professors will banter 
back and forth with students about 
how much our president sucks in a 
“come on, we all think this, right?” 
kind of way. I’ve had professors 
assign me satire readings poking 
fun at the Republican party and its 
old, white, bigoted male members. 
These viewpoints are valid, and I’m 
not saying I didn’t gain insight from 
them. However, once in a while, it 
would be nice to see the other side 
represented. I’ve also been taught 
there’s been more U.S. homicides 
in the past few years than ever 
before. If you look at any given 
chart online, however, it’ll actually 
show homicide rates have declined 
since their 1980 peak. I don’t think 
professors have any malicious 
intent to make conservative views 
obsolete. In fact, they may not even 
be aware that the way they teach 
their content leaves little room for 
debate. They probably think that 
everyone shares the same liberal 
ideology and therefore, there’s no 
need to acknowledge the other 
side. Conservatives may speak up 
against liberal claims, but they’re 
put in a position where they feel like 
outcasts in the room. 
The Washington Post has a 
slogan that reads “Democracy 
Dies in Darkness.” Freedom of 
speech and press are crucial 
aspects of our democracy. From 
these rights, we gain a wealth of 
knowledge. 
Historically, 
slaves 
were not permitted to learn to read 
as a tactic to reduce their power and 
potential. Their suppressors feared 
that any gained knowledge or skills 
would incite them to rebel. Political 

party affiliation aside, it should 
be in everyone’s best interest to 
protect our freedom of expression 
to preserve our democracy and 
strengthen our knowledge. This 
entails everyone having a voice, not 
just the majority. 
The 
problem 
with 
the 
manifestation of similar beliefs 
and like-minded groups is that any 
opinion, even slightly contrary, 
seems extreme. Author George 
Orwell warned us all of the dangers 
of groupthink, and one of his 
warning signs is that any unpopular 
opinion will stand out like a sore 
thumb. Some may already feel like 
this in class, but there’s still hope. As 
it is now, when a conservative voice 
speaks up, about 10 other liberal 
students will raise their hands in 
defense. The enthusiasm is there, 
but let’s make sure to address — 
rather than attack — the claims that 
are being made. 
I’ll argue liberals have shifted 
more left on the political spectrum 
due to constant reinforcement. 
As liberal opinions become more 
circulated, those widely spread 
views produce the baseline for 
comparison. As a result, views that 
were once considered extreme 
now 
seem 
more 
moderate. 
It’s become more popular, for 
example, for students to be in 
favor of socialism, open borders 
and sweeping gun legislation. 
In contrast, conservative views 
seem more extreme because they 
are shared less frequently in the 
classroom. The perspective that 
illegal immigration is a crime or 
that background checks are more 
effective than gun bans might seem 
controversial now just because 
they stand out starkly against 
popular 
notions. 
Unpopular 
beliefs can be true, though, and 
with greater interaction, they can 
be realized. For instance, most 
liberals reference other countries 
with tighter gun laws as evidence 
that gun laws work. New Zealand 
is the exception, then, because 
in March of 2019, they had two 
consecutive mass shootings in 
which 51 people died.

T

he hospitals at Michigan 
Medicine are the best in 
the state and among the 
best in the entire nation. So why is 
it so hard to park here? 
The story of Michigan Medicine 
over the past two decades is a 
story 
of 
continual 
expansion: 
more hospitals, clinics, academic 
buildings, patients and employees. 
It’s painfully obvious that if 
you spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars to add buildings and people 
to an already crowded medical 
complex, you need to put some 
thought — and resources — into 
more parking, more shuttle buses 
and other transportation options. 
Unfortunately, the University 
administration does not have a 
firm understanding of the obvious. 
The result is considerable pain 
for patients seeking care and for 
workers whose jobs are to provide 
that care. 
By pain, we mean patients who 
must arrive at their appointments 
an hour or more ahead of time, 
adding another toll to what may 
be an already stressful experience 
associated 
with 
health 
care 
appointments.
By pain, we mean nurses 
leaving their homes at 5 a.m. 
to arrive for a 12-hour shift 
beginning at 7 a.m. Since a U-M 
“Blue” employee parking pass 
— which costs more than $700 
a year — is nothing more than a 
license to hunt for a parking space, 
many nurses, house officers and 
other employees arrive by 6 a.m. 
to snag a spot and catch a nap in 
their cars until their shifts start.
Resident doctors and dentists, 
meanwhile, 
often 
visit 
the 
hospital and one or more clinic 
sites during a typical workday. 
When parking is a nightmare, 
that means precious minutes — 
or hours — are wasted driving 
around looking for a space instead 
of seeing patients. Is that any way 
to run a hospital?
To be clear, as elected leaders 
of unions representing nurses, 
resident doctors and dentists at 

Michigan Medicine, we’re glad to 
see our hospitals and clinics grow 
and expand. Our members are 
deeply committed to providing 
quality health care, and it’s great 
to see the University offering 
more services in more places to 
more people.
A new, 264-bed, state-of-the-
art hospital tower sounds terrific. 
The building, however, won’t take 
care of people by itself. To remain 
a great hospital, U-M needs great 
doctors, 
nurses, 
technicians 
and support staff. But you can’t 
attract top people with miserable 
working conditions. 
Can a nurse who has to nap 
in their car before starting work 
really deliver top quality care? 
Can hospital staff do their best 
when a 12-hour shift stretches 
to 16 hours or more because of a 
two- or three-hour commute in 
each direction? 
There are currently nearly 
29,000 
Michigan 
Medicine 
employees, 
but 
only 
10,000 
parking spaces on the medical 
campus. 
Those 
spaces 
serve 
patients, visitors and employees. 
The new hospital tower will add 
about 1,600 new employees, along 
with more patients. So, when 
University officials brag about 
adding 1,000 new parking spaces 
next year, the math just doesn’t 
add up.
The problem isn’t just that we 
don’t have enough spaces. It’s 
that University administrators 
— who have privileged “Gold” 
passes allowing them to park 
steps away from their offices 
— seem to have no idea what’s 
needed to meet the needs of a 
facility that operates 24 hours a 
day, 365 days a year. 
Not 
everyone 
can 
park 
next to the hospital or clinic 
where they work. But shouldn’t 
administrators of a university 
with an $11.9 billion endowment 
be able to keep remote parking 
lots well-maintained and well-lit 
for the safety of employees who 
work shifts around the clock?

Of course they should — but 
they don’t. They also have failed 
to provide enough shuttle buses 
to get workers to and from remote 
lots in a reasonable time frame. 
Thankfully, 
there’s 
progress 
on that front: After months of 
employee complaints, Michigan 
Medicine has announced that 
more shuttle buses will be coming 
online, for exclusive use by health 
service employees. 
It’s not as though we didn’t see 
these problems coming. Parking 
has been a terrible problem at 
U-M hospitals for decades. We 
knew it would get worse when 
administrators first announced 
a plan last March to convert 
an onsite employee lot to more 
convenient parking for patients 
(which patients need and deserve). 
Our unions immediately asked 
to negotiate about how this plan 
would be implemented, as part of 
our responsibility to bargain over 
working conditions. University 
administrators said no. We asked 
for information about parking 
pass utilization for all employees 
and executives. Again, University 
administrators said no.
No wonder the frustration 
boiled over in October, with 
hospital 
workers 
chanting 
and carrying signs outside the 
groundbreaking 
for 
the 
new 
hospital tower. We’re sorry if we 
intruded on a celebration for major 
donors and blue-chip guests, but 
we’ve got a job to do: taking care 
of patients. To do it properly, we 
need safe, accessible parking so 
we can get to work on time. 
This issue isn’t going away — 
and we’ll keep making noise until 
the University gets it right.

“There may be trouble ahead,” Sharon Van 
Etten warns us — and certainly when it comes to 
Jeff Goldblum, one can always expect a spark of 
mischief. Right off the bat, his new album makes 
a bold promise to secrecy and playful roguishness. 
Between Van Etten’s ominous vocal opening, and 
the title of his new album, I Shouldn’t Be Telling 
You This, there certainly seems to be something 
special in store. Please, Jeff, tell us more — or 
rather, tell us anyway! As always, we welcome 
Goldblum’s brand of trouble with open arms.
For those of you wondering: Jeff Goldblum 
and jazz — what the heck? Here’s a quick recap in 
the wacky misadventures of everyone’s favorite 
“Jurassic Park” hot scientist: The suspect was 
last seen here within the pages of the Arts 
section for a review of his 2018 debut album, The 
Capitol Studio Sessions with The Mildred Snitzer 
Orchestra. As Goldblum’s first public foray into 
jazz performance, the album — a mix of traditional 
smokey-jazz club and stand up comedy — featured 
a range of performers, from the hypnotic vocals 
of Haley Reinhart to the witty quips of comedian 
Sarah Silverman. 
I Shouldn’t Be Telling You This does a good job of 
recycling what worked well in The Capitol Studio 
Sessions without bogging the album down with 
boring repetition. What made Goldblum’s debut 
remarkable was his ability to meld comedy and 
music in a single album; the comedy didn’t intrude 
upon the act of musical performance, and neither 
did Goldblum take himself too seriously. Alongside 
good-natured, witty chit-chat between songs — 
The Capitol Studio Sessions was a live recording 
— the album managed to add some much-needed 
life to a genre considered to be “dying,” if not dead 
already. 
Just as he did the first time around, Goldblum 
finds his stride is the core foundation of his 
revitalization of classic hits with a modern touch. 
I Shouldn’t Be Telling You This features a range 
of covers with a more robust roster of celebrity 
guests: From big names like pop-icon Miley Cyrus 
and Sharon Van Etten, to more obscure artists 
Fiona Apple and Gregory Porter, Goldblum invests 
in greater artistic diversity on his second run. Like 
a classic Hollywood blockbuster, half the fun of 
the album comes from Goldblum’s class of musical 
A-listers — who wouldn’t want to hear Miley Cyrus 
sing her version of blues legend B.B. King’s songs? 
Goldblum also nails the tricky tightrope walk 
between nostalgic indulgence and reinvention. 
Nearly every song on the album is a cover, but 
each cover is able to stand on its own. “Let’s Face 
The Music and Dance,” the opening song in the 
album, features Sharon Van Etten’s slow, honey-
dripping voice. A touch ominous and romantic, 
Van Etten flips the tables by emphasizing the 

somber undertones of the lyrics, rather than the 
traditional upbeat, energetic versions of Nat King 
Cole and Frank Sinatra. More significantly, the 
song recalls a famous scene of Fred Astaire and 
Ginger Rogers’s 1963 movie “Follow the Fleet.” 
In sorrowful serenade, Astaire coaxes Rogers 
into a final dance, all parts romantic, longing and 
beautiful. As Rogers and Astaire spin across the 
stage, coming together and then falling apart just 
as quickly, Van Etten’s version of the classic “Let’s 
Face The Music and Dance” captures the tragic 
essence of Rogers and Astaire’s original version.
The fun doesn’t stop there: Other notable songs 
(and there are many) include “The Sidewinder/
The Beat Goes On,” featuring the vocals of Inara 
George. Bright and energetic, George’s wispy, 
alluring voice totally transforms this all-too-
familiar hit into a convincing old-time swing 
song. Famously performed by Sonny and Cher 
in 1967, “The Beat Goes On” wasn’t originally a 
jazz tune — until Jeff Goldblum came along, that 
is. “Make Someone Happy,” featuring Gregory 
Porter, offers an uplifting spin on a melancholy 
song through Porter’s earnest, rich vocals and 
the smile-inducing backup singers who chime in 
throughout.
Goldblum’s cheerful, somewhat eccentric spirit 
is infused to the very essence of his new album — 
just like the last and, I’m sure, like the next one 
too. Last time I wrote of Goldblum, I noted that 
fun is what permeates Goldblum’s music — and fun 
is everywhere to be fun in I Shouldn’t Be Telling 
You This, too. When it comes to reviving a genre 
— jazz is so much more than a genre — Goldblum 
may be exactly what we need. Fun is what jazz is, 
and fun is what might just “save” jazz from the 
dark clutches of becoming yet another “Ew, that’s 
something my parents like, no thanks!” Maybe 
what Goldblum “shouldn’t be telling us” is that 
jazz, like a lot of old things, can be cool. Moreover, 
it can be ours. While we spend our limited time on 
Earth fighting every war we can find, there is still 
life to be enjoyed. Maybe in the great generational 
clash of the 21st century, we can find some common 
ground in jazz. After all, “while there’s music, and 
moonlight /And love and romance / Let’s face the 
music and dance.”

Jeff Goldblum makes jazz?

FOOD COLUMN

“I’m going to tell you, like, the true story. Nobody 
got the story right yet. We haven’t told any press 
this whole thing yet,” said Ian Lafowitz, co-owner 
of Joe’s Pizza (all five New York City locations and 
the new Ann Arbor one). 
This is just what I hoped would happen — just 
like the pizza, I’d come to Joe’s in search of the 
true authenticity I knew was there. I’d let the dust 
settle between Joe’s Ann Arbor grand opening and 
my strategic entrance to the Diag-adjacent pizza 
spot. I knew if I let press go crazy in the first week 
of business for the sake of the “timely lead” or what 
have you, I’d afford myself a more meaningful 
interaction with the new restaurant weeks into the 
future. I was right.
“A food columnist or critic knows better than to 
show up on opening day,” Lafowitz said next. He 
is a Michigan graduate (’00) and was awaiting the 
perfect moment to disclose the Joe’s Pizza story.
 I grew up on the stuff — Joe’s pizza, that is. Us 
Mid-Atlantic dwellers have been familiar with the 
famous slice since birth. I’ve already bridged the 
topic of New York pizza in a former column, but 
haven’t revisited the topic of pizza since having 
received some emails deeply defending the Detroit 
slice. I haven’t changed my opinions, and it’s finally 
time to talk about something more important than 
the pizza pie, and that is the simple slice. 
A good pizza eater knows well the difference 
between a pizza that’s supposed to be purchased 
and consumed as a whole pie and a pizza that’s 
meant to be purchased and consumed as an 
individual slice — on a white paper plate, grease 
seeping from crust to palms. Joe’s is the latter, and 
it has an easy, inexpensive, quick persona which 
lends itself well to a college town on the go. 
“Joe’s opening in Ann Arbor, Michigan makes 
zero fucking sense,” Lafowitz began, when I asked 
how they wound up selecting Michigan as the first 
state to open in after finding such success in New 
York. “But it made sense to me,” he said. 
Lafowitz is one of very few non-family members 
working alongside the Joe Pozzouli family within 
the Joe’s pizza-making business. 
“I had no restaurant experience when I got into 
this, I was a writer working in New York after 
graduating from U of M in 2000. Joe’s Pizza had 
been going religiously on Carmine Street since 
1999,” he said. I can picture the location well in 
my mind, having grown up eating there with my 
father, and spending many nights this past summer 
as the sky went purple, standing in line at 2 a.m. for 
a slice of New York’s best pizza. 
Lafowitz had an apartment right near the 
Greenwich Village Joe’s location until he moved 
to the Upper West Side and suddenly struggled to 
find good pizza just miles away from his former 
apartment. 
“Within two weeks I was like, there’s literally 
no good pizza on the Upper West Side. I asked all 
my friends up there where they got good pizza, and 
they were like oh, easy, we go to Joe’s.” 
From there, Lafowitz decided he was going 
to approach the Joe’s family, having no prior 
connection to them to ask if they’d want to open a 
second location up on the Upper West Side. He saw 
a potential and passion within Joe’s that seemed 
too special to contain on one New York street 
corner. It seemed like a pretty simple feat, but with 
no tangible menu and no website, it was pretty 
much impossible to track down the family. After a 
few months of grafting, he found an email address 
and managed to get on a phone call with Joe Jr. 
— the son of famed Joe Pozzouli, the patriarch of 
pizza. 
“He was really responsive to my ideas. I was like 
I think you guys should open up another location 
and I want to help. I can do the real estate or the 

money. I was basically like you guys have given me 
so much in my time living in New York and for that 
I want to help you guys, what can we do,” Lafowitz 
said on his early conversations with the family. 
Lafowitz and Joe Jr. aligned at the best time — Joe 
Jr. was one of the only direct descendents to go 
to college over going right into the pizza making 
business. Being back in New York, he was fired up, 
young and interested in Lafowitz passion for his 
family’s business. 
“For a year we went back and forth on phone 
calls. Finally, we met at the Starbucks on 6th 
Avenue. I didn’t know what I was getting into, but 
Joe Jr. was basically like I really like you, I believe 
in these ideas, let’s go meet my father — and I said 
‘right now?’ And he said ‘yep, right now.’” 
Joe Jr. warned Lafowitz that his father would 
either want to listen to what he had to say or 
turn away and be uninterested. This would 
be Lafowitz’s one and only chance to make an 
impression on Joe and would change the fate of 
the pizzeria forever. Joe Sr. spoke broken English, 
mostly Italian, and never missed a day working in 
the pizzeria. 
Pino “Joe” Pozzuoli Sr. immigrated from 
Naples, Italy in 1950 and opened his first pizzeria 
in Boston. Since 1975, Mr. Pozzuoli has been 
making pizzas every single day in Greenwich 
Village, New York City. Sal and Pino Vitale (Joe’s 
grandsons) and cousin Giovanni Carollo have 
been huge parts of the Joe’s pizza pilgrimage as 
well. The day Lafowitz met the family in the back 
of Joe’s, Pozzuoli took immediate liking to him. 
Lafowitz claimed he “just started talking, and Joe 
Sr. listened.”
“I work with a three-generation family of pizza 
makers. I’m one of the only people who work 
with them that isn’t blood. They are so incredibly 
passionate — and every single one of them has 
experiences and stories that make this family and 
this pizza what it is,” Lafowitz said, “Joe Sr. is 83 
and that man makes pizzas seven days a week. The 
family is what’s ‘in the sauce.’”
Lafowitz and the Pizzouli family immediately 
made plans for the future of Joe’s. Together they 
opened four New York locations: 14th Street, 
Brooklyn, Times Square and Fulton St. Joe’s blood 
runs each and every location for authenticity sake. 
Lafowitz knew, as the other New York locations 
proved successful, that the next step would be to 
open out of state. 
“We thought about a lot of places. I’d been to 
D.C., Boston, Miami and Philly to think about 
opening somewhere else.” 
Somehow, though, they landed in Ann Arbor, 
Mich.
“I was back here at a football game last year,” 
Lafowitz said, “and I saw the place where Joe’s is 
now and I felt like it was this underserved part of 
town. I mean when I was here the only quick and 
easy place to eat in the South U area was Subway. So 
I looked at my friend, another Michigan graduate, 
who owned Michigan alumni bar Professor Tom’s 
in New York at the time, and I said, ‘If I got serious 
about opening Joe’s in Ann Arbor would you sell 
your bar and help me?’ And he immediately said 
yes.” Pete Levin, another Michigan graduate, is 
Lafowitz’s partner in the Ann Arbor location. 
Next steps included having the whole family 
come experience a weekend in Ann Arbor to “get 
them hyped,” as Lafowitz puts it. “You can’t force 
anyone. Everyone has to sign off on these things. 
I brought them to football games and basketball 
games and showed them the campus and everyone 
fell in love with it here.” Suddenly the Manhattan 
constant was to be the first New York street slice 
in Ann Arbor. 
The foodie in me wanted to talk recipe, so of 
course, I went there next.

Joe’s Pizza: The real story

ELI RALLO
Daily Food Columnist

Like any medium that slowly transitions into sophistication, 
modern video games are increasingly paying homage to the 
classics. As the age of the average gamer gets older and computing 
technology becomes more sophisticated, any reminder of the 
old days taps into a deep-rooted nostalgia that warms the heart 
of those old enough to remember. No other game in 2019 better 
exemplifies this reverence to the past than The Outer Worlds. 
A space-western themed adventure, The Outer Worlds doesn’t 
try anything new. Instead of attempting to amaze you with new 
cutting edge features, The Outer Worlds just simply reminds you 
what makes video games fun in the first place.
Within the first few hours of The Outer Worlds the player is 
immediately hit with reference after reference to older classics 
of the RPG genre. The character creation at the beginning is 
shockingly similar to any Fallout game, and the intro sequence 
steals numerous shots from the intro to Bioshock. The time dilation 
power, a mechanic that lets the player slow down time, is identical 
to the Dead Eye mechanic in Red Dead Redemption. These are 
just a few notable ones — veteran gamers will undoubtedly spend 

hours finding all the little tributes littered throughout the game. 
However, despite the constant copying, The Outer Worlds still 
maintains its own distinct identity. Like a Quentin Tarantino 
movie, The Outer Worlds remixes successful aspects of older 
games and merges them into a ‘40s art deco-inspired space frontier 
that carries a dark humor while also being whimsically cute.
You play as a space colonist who, after being frozen in cryo-sleep 
for years, is awoken to a galactic frontier controlled by feudalistic 
corporations. After establishing their bearings and acquiring a 
spaceship, the player is free to explore the galaxy. Open world but 
not truly an open world, The Outer Worlds is split into planets, 
dividing the game into smaller regions of exploration. This means 
you can’t aimlessly walk to the edges of the world in search of 
adventure. Rarely did I find serendipitous encounters, and most 
exploration felt contrived, but it was never to 
the point to make me stop playing. Fortunately, 
each planet has its own unique feel — some 
have exotic wildlife and megafauna, while 
others boast futuristic cities and sweatshop-like 
factories.
With exploration limited, the core of your 
adventure is the relationships you forge with 
characters and factions within the world. Some 
characters can become your travel companions, 
aiding you on mission and in combat. The Outer 
Worlds has a surprising amount of depth in its 
companion customization. Companions have 
their own skill trees, equipment loadouts, combat 
perks and special abilities. Refreshingly, non-
combat skills actually seem to matter. Missions 
can sometimes be completed diplomatically and 
a shrewd choice of words can unlock secrets 
that combat never could. Mastery of dialogue, 
engineering, hacking, and other non fighting 
based abilities had tangible effects on the game 
world. You’ll be regularly mixing and matching 
different companions based on the context of the 
mission because nothing is ever one size fits all.
In a traditional Fallout fashion, the decisions 

you make tend to lie within morally grey territory and ultimately 
have an effect on the outcome of the story. Nothing you ever do, 
however, is so drastic as to permanently change the game. The 
Outer Worlds isn’t trying to push edges — it just wants the player 
to have fun. Though the choices will always be moral quandaries, 
you’ll always come back even if you made a supposedly “wrong” 
decision.
It’s hard to come by a game like The Outer Worlds in 2019. In 
an era where most games are trying to be experimental or change 
the industry, many forget that fun should always be the focus. 
Borrowing successful elements from classic titles, The Outer 
Worlds is a good ol’ fashioned video game. With all its homages, it 
reminds gamers of the fun we used to have as kids and assures us 
that this fun still lives today.

An ode to the classics: The Outer Worlds is incomparable

Two years ago, British television network 
Channel 4 released a show on Netflix that said 
“screw you” to the teenage romance genre and 
made a fresh series about two teenagers who 
run away together. While it sounds “Moonrise 
Kingdom”-esque, there’s so much more that 
differentiates it from your average “Romeo and 
Juliet” adaptation. Those fateful two years ago, the 
show left off on a painstaking cliffhanger that left 
fans wondering whether the show was meant to 
end on an open-ended note. Then, “The End of the 
F***ing World” came back into the picture quite 
suddenly, with Netflix releasing its trailer only two 
weeks before the new season was to come. 
The show tells the tale of James (Alex Lawther, 
“Alex’s Dream”) and Alyssa (Jessica Barden, 
“Jungleland”), two teenagers from a small town 
who are learning to navigate through their 
unfortunate life circumstances. It has a cliché 
premise but strays far from tropes: In the first 
season, James thinks he’s a psychopath and aims 
to kill Alyssa, who at the time was a pessimistic, 
impulsive girl who dates James because he seems 
interesting. They run away together, kill a man 
whose house they were squatting in, run from the 
cops, fall in love and the rest is history. James gets 
shot at the end of Season 1, and the curtains close. 
When we come back in Season 2, we’re introduced 
to Bonnie (Naomi Ackie, “The Corrupted”), a 
tortured woman who seeks out to avenge the death 
of the Professor Clive Koch (Jonathan Aris, “The 
War of the Worlds”), the man Alyssa and James 
killed, who, by the way, had previously tried to 
rape Alyssa and several other women. 
One of the main concerns with the new season 
was the looming question of whether it was even 
meant to exist. The entertainment industry, 
particularly streaming platforms, has a nasty habit 
of renewing television and movies until they’re 
way past overkill, which fortunately isn’t the case 
for this series. Season 2 maintains and enhances 
all the elements that Season 1 had to begin with 
— the drama, the suspense, the unpredictability, 
the relatability and the comedic elements that 
imitate the comic book from which the show was 
adapted. They talk about how trauma impacts 
romantic relationships in ways that are hardly 

seen on television, and while James struggles to 
tell Alyssa that he still loves her after all the time 
apart, Alyssa says “I am not the answer,” making it 
clear that she can’t fix his trauma in the way that 
he expects her to. 
Identical to the first season, the second comes 
out with a short eight episodes, each a half-hour 
long. Both seasons can be easily binged in one 
full day of work or a long Friday night, but they’re 
nonetheless complex and three-dimensional. No 
important character is left behind — each one 
has a complex story behind their actions that was 
introduced in succinct ways that didn’t require 
the show to waste precious screen time. With a 
high production value, the show never slacks on 
providing us with effortless visual artistry and 
screenshot-worthy scene arrangements that add to 
the plot in ways that need no explanation. 
While they leave room for a season three, the 
way the show’s writers weave the plot together 
doesn’t call for one. They wrap up all the loose 
ends in a neat little bow, and all the unanswered 
questions from season one are presented smoothly 
and sensibly. It is unpredictable at every turn, 
but not enough for it to fly off the rails like some 
crime shows think they can get away with. You’ll 
find yourself empathizing with every character 
(except hopefully Clive Koch) in ways you 
wouldn’t expect, even characters like Bonnie who 
are conventionally “the bad guy.” It goes by so 
quick — there’s no reason not to watch this show 
during your office job or your boring lecture. It’s 
heartbreaking, hopeful, funny and all the other 
positive adjectives associated with good television 
and it’s definitely worth a snippet of your time.

consumed by a swirling blizzard. In Stephen 
King’s novel, Jack and the Overlook explode in 
a ball of fire. King frequently cites this as the 
reason he hates the film: In the movie the hotel 
freezes, and in the book it burns. 
This works as a comparison. The film version 
of “The Shining” is humanity at its coldest and 
most remote, and the novel is humanity at its 
most passionate and conflicted. Kubrick’s Jack 
Torrance is detached from the start, and his 
transformation into a violent sociopath is never 
surprising, however much ghosts have to do 
with it. King’s Torrance fights insanity for the 
sake of his family, most of which seems to come 
from The Overlook itself, not his own soul. 
This mischaracterization, as King sees it, has 
haunted him since “The Shining” was released. 
To him, Jack Torrance is more than just a 
character. The book was written while King was 
suffering from alcoholism, and struggled to see 
the light at the end of the tunnel. He used Jack 
to explore this battle, detailing how it strained 
his creative pursuits and relationships with his 
wife and children.
It’s no wonder King wanted the adaption to 
get it right. The problem is, “The Shining” as 
a movie is too good to be written off for one 
inaccuracy. The cinematography, production 
design and performances are all too wonderful 
to ignore. So, how does one reconcile the 
personal core of the novel with the cinematic 
gravitas of the film? Mike Flanagan’s “Doctor 
Sleep” is how. 
“Sleep” centers on Danny Torrence (Ewan 
Mcgregor, “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace”), 

a grown-up version of Jack’s son. Like Jack, 
he suffers from alcoholism. He also has what’s 
called “The Shining,” a psychic ability that 
allows him to read thoughts from the living and 
the dead. 
He drifts from dive bar to dive bar, sleeping 
under bridges and trying to forget the trauma 
he endured at the hands of The Overlook and 
his father. When he meets a young, powerful 
girl named Abra (Kyliegh Curran) who’s being 
hunted by a nefarious cult led by Rose the Hat 
(Rebecca Ferguson, “The Girl on The Train”), 
he has to face his demons to save her. 
Danny Torrence possesses the heart that was 
lacking in the original film, asking very human 
questions that come from King’s novel. How 
does one live on after horror? Does one try to 
escape it altogether, or meet it head on? Will it 
consume them regardless? Flanagan wrestles 
with addiction, trauma, and family dysfunction 
in a nuanced way that would make King proud. 
While Flanagan’s script suffers from some 
hyperbole and simplistic dialogue, the plot 
moves along well enough, with some great 
twists 
and 
horrifying 
punches 
sprinkled 
throughout. It is his directing that really 
shines, though. Flanagan’s cinematography is 
endlessly inventive, making every scene, from 
the mundane to the cosmic, intoxicating.
There are moments in “Doctor Sleep” that 
are searingly terrifying, that will haunt one 
when they lay alone in the dark, trying to sleep. 
Yet I still found it to be one of the most uplifting 
movies of the year, showing how people can 
band together and reach for something higher. 
“Doctor Sleep” has the scares of Kubrick, with 
the heart of King. 
“Doctor Sleep” is more than just a cash grab 
or nostalgia fest. It’s an artistic reconciliation, 
aesthetically blending the two respective 
horror masterpieces it comes from along with 
the psychological ideas that made them both 
so compelling. It is simultaneously dark and 
empathetic, terrifying and heartwarming. No 
horror fan should miss it.
However much it throws Kubrick’s canonical 
imagery at the viewer, engendering some of the 
powerful, but fleeting, feelings that nostalgic 
movies like “The Force Awakens” do, one 
difference is key: At the end of “Doctor Sleep,” 
finally, after decades, The Overlook can finally 
burn. It’s a sight to see.

‘Sleep’ is a horror must-see

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

I’m thankful for home. My lack of one, precisely. 
Let me clarify: I’ve never really felt at home 
anywhere.
I could say that Los Angeles is my home because 
that’s where the majority of my extended family is 
from. We spend Christmas there. We lived in a little 
blue house in Lunada Bay when I was in elementary 
school. I could say I’m from Florida because I was 
born there, but we left when I was only a few 
months old on a plane with Linda Ronstadt sitting 
next to me and my mother. The place I lived the 
longest was Alabama. I lived there through middle 
school and learned how to respect those older than 
me, but also gained a sense of strict, unwavering 
gender roles. I could say I’m from Virginia, where 
I went to high school, because my parents still live 
and work there now. 
The places I’ve listed are the major ones. I’ve 
lived in 10 different “homes” in my life.
I could say that my home originated with 
my ancestors in Greece, Southern Germany or 
Scotland. We still eat all the food from before my 
grandparents emigrated, and the languages were 
sprinkled into my life.
I’ve never had a hometown. I don’t have a place 
that I’m really “from.” I’m from the United States 
I suppose, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it is 
that our country is boundlessly different depending 
on where you hail from. From common vernacular 
to basic morals and beliefs, the most influential 
people in my life would be foreign to each other. 
When I think of home, I think of a place that’s 
nowhere specific, but my family is there: My 
mother, father and brother are there. We are all 
laughing about how hilarious it is to be all together. 
Preferably, we are on a beach, but maybe it’s at a 
diner. 
I’m grateful for the people that fill up my life, the 
ones that are far more important than the places 
and material things that shape them. I will never 
long for a certain lifestyle because I’ve known so 

many. 
Moving around has allowed me to be free from 
some of the prejudices or biases that come with 
being from any one place. I’ve learned how to be 
compassionate. Pain is still pain and love is still love 
regardless of where you are from. 
When people ask me where I’m from, I still 
pause. It shouldn’t be a hard question; it’s just that 
whatever my response is, no matter how succinct or 
clever, will never give that person an actual sense of 
who I am. But now, I like to think of it as more of a 
secret weapon than a downfall. 
Now, I’m from Ann Arbor just as much as I’m 
from anywhere else. I’m addicted to the notion 
of the University being referred to as “hoMe.” 
People from all over the world, not just the 
country, congregate here to share ideas and tackle 
the world’s wicked problems. I’m sure there are 
countless students here that think home is more 
about the people you love rather than a place. That’s 
what’s so great about this rapidly globalizing world 
in the first place, right?

Johnny Beecher’s body language said it all.

The freshman forward had a breakaway 

with senior forward Jake Slaker running the 

ice on the opposite side of the neutral zone in 

the first period. But Beecher swung the pass 

too early and Slaker crossed the blue line with 

the puck while Beecher was already in the 

offensive zone, causing an offsides call.

It was just one wasted chance in a game of 

many — ultimately leading to a 3-1 loss for the 

Wolverines (3-5-2 overall, 0-3-1-0 Big Ten) 

against the Golden Gophers (4-4-1, 1-1-2-2). 

But the frustration of wasting such perfect 

opportunity was too much for Beecher in the 

moment. He swung his head back and stared 

at the silver panels on the ceiling of Yost.

As Beecher claimed his place on the 

bench, Slaker sat next to him and patted the 

freshman’s hanging head. It was early in the 

game. Opportunities were a dime a dozen, 

and there would be plenty more chances to 

score. But as the period dwindled and the 

remaining periods dawned onward, those 

chances came. The much-needed goals 

themselves, however, would not.

“If you look at the last four periods, we 

played pretty well,” Michigan coach Mel 

Pearson said. “And you have not much to 

show for it. You can’t fault the effort. You can’t 

fault the opportunities we got. They created.”

And by the end of the game, after an 

empty-net goal by Minnesota forward Sammy 

Walker put a win out of reach, there was no 

veteran player, no alternate captain or reliable 

presence to calm the mounting frustration.

As the horn sounded, Beecher slammed his 

stick against the ice. Slaker slammed his stick 

against the empty net. It broke in two, much 

like the spirits of the remaining Michigan 

players.

“We’re not getting those bounces,” said 

senior defenseman Luke Martin. “A lot of 

posts, a lot of weird plays around their net and 

ours. It’s hard not to get frustrated.”

All game, the Wolverines created high-

danger opportunities — ones where a simple 

tap in from a rebound or another step before 

the extra pass would have been the difference 

between the offense getting shut down and 

dominating a toss-up matchup. 

Michigan outshot Minnesota in the first 

period, tied it in the second period, and again, 

outshot it in the third, totaling 39 shots on net. 

The players were getting good looks. They 

were finding the open man. They just couldn’t 

take advantage of it.

“It’s frustrating for us watching as 

coaches,” Pearson said. “I know that. All you 

can do is put yourself in a position to get good 

scoring opportunities and take your chances.”

Even on the penalty kill, such as in the first 

period, the Wolverines stemmed the tides and 

turned a disadvantage into a Grade-A scoring 

chance when Eric Ciccolini returned to five-

on-five play. 

While the Gophers were focused on 

attacking on the power play, Ciccolini 

hopped out the box and broke away for 

an uncontested confrontation with the 

Minnesota goaltender when the power play 

ended. He dangled the puck here and there, 

but in the end, couldn’t convert.

The scoring drought was only amplified 

by the fact that, while it was seemingly 

outplaying the Gophers the entire night, 

Michigan was down by at least a goal for the 

majority of the game.

Slammed sticks, constant head shaking and 

visibly frustrated Wolverine players offered a 

good explanation of what occurred.

Defense, goaltending not enough against Gophers

There’s a saying in sports 
that the score of a game doesn’t 
always reflect how close it was. 
Sometimes misused, it was 
emblematic 
Saturday 
night 
when the Michigan hockey 
team fell, 3-1, to Minnesota.
The third goal the Wolverines 
gave up was an empty netter 
in the final minute, while the 
second was the result of a 
fluke play where sophomore 
goaltender Strauss Mann tried 
to collect a rebound off the 
boards behind the goal line, but 
the puck bounced too far to an 
opposing player in the crease. 
And chance played a pivotal 
role on the first goal, too. The 
Golden Gophers were on a 
two-on-one against freshman 
defenseman Cam York, whilst 
redshirt junior forward Luke 
Morgan hustled back. Both 
players dove to choke the 
passing lane, but the puck 
ultimately bounced off York, 
then off Morgan’s left skate to 
a Minnesota forward near the 
crease.
If any of those bounces went 
another way, the game could 
have had a different tone. 
Thus there is weight behind 
the saying. But this raises the 
question, what kept the game 
close to begin with? And the 
answer to that is, undoubtedly, 
the defensive effort.
“The one nice thing, not nice, 
but the one underlying thing 
here is we’re playing so hard 
defensively and doing a lot of 
things on the right side of the 
puck,” said Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson. “So when we do start 
to score, we’ve already got that 
mentality of how we need to 
play away from it, and how hard 
we have to play defensively.”
While the offense struggled 
to score till late, the defense 
was cohesive. On the penalty 
kill, the players skated in 
unison to block shooting lanes. 
There were many more dives 
throughout 
the 
game 
than 

those on the conceded goal — 
many that actually worked. For 
instance, following a faceoff in 
the Wolverines’ attacking zone 
late in the opening period the 
Gophers got a quick rush, but 
sophomore defenseman Jack 
Summers went on all fours to 
keep the game close early on.
“I think that’s been real 
key for us we’re not scoring 
a 
ton 
right 
now but we’re 
playing 
great 
defensively,” 
Mann 
said. 
“And 
my 
defensemen are 
playing 
really 
great in front 
of me which is 
great and that’s 
really a recipe 
for success in 
the future.”
A 
substantial 
portion 
of 
Minnesota’s scoring chances 
weren’t 
due 
to 
mistakes 
in the defensive zone, but 
rather simple giveaways on 
the attack that led to odd-
man rushes. This was evident 
late in the third period when 
junior forward Dakota Raabe 
took a weak slap shot from 

near the blue line. Due to the 
lack of pace, forward Blake 
McLaughlin grabbed it out of 
the air, and thus Michigan had 
to defend another rush.
“We’ve got control of the 
puck and we whiff on it and 
they poke it and they’re gone 
and it ends up in the net. It’s 
frustrating,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“It’s really frustrating. I feel 
bad 
for 
our 
guys, 
actually, 
because they’re 
working 
hard. 
They’re working 
their 
tails 
off 
and 
we 
don’t 
have anything to 
show for it.”
Mann 
was 
the 
backbone 
of the defense. 
Ignoring 
the 
gaffe on the second goal, he 
made key saves all night. Seven 
minutes into the game, junior 
forward 
Jack 
Becker 
lost 
possession right in front of the 
Wolverines’ net resulting in an 
easy chance for the Gophers, 
but Mann deflected the puck 
upward to get out of harm’s 
way. 
Late in the second period, he 

made a stellar glove save off a 
two-on-one attack to keep his 
team within one. And he stayed 
calm despite the mishap on the 
second goal. This was pivotal 
midway 
through 
the 
final 
frame, when Minnesota moved 
the puck back and forth from 
near the left circle to the slot. 
Mann maintained his position 
and moved quickly to block the 
shot when it finally came.
“I feel bad for him because 
he’s losing games,” Pearson 
said. “And you look at his record 
and if you didn’t know his goals 
against you wonder, ‘Oh this 
kid just keeps losing, why do 
we keep playing him?’ But he 
continues to do a great job. … 
You look at the goals against 
and we can’t fault him on any of 
that for sure.”
Not faulting Mann and the 
defensive unit is the most 
logical, as without them the 
Wolverines 
likely 
wouldn’t 
have had any shot at winning. 
But 
Michigan 
must 
also 
complement it’s defensive unit 
with a better attack, otherwise 
the efforts will continue to 
go to waste and the team will 
have to keep residing to mere 
sayings.

Offensive struggles continue for Wolverines

The game was right there on 
Jimmy Lambert’s stick.
He cut toward the net and into 
the left faceoff circle, alone and 
waiting. The scrum on the other 
end of the zone resulted in Johnny 
Beecher caressing the puck away 
from the battlefield of bodies, 
and the freshman forward was 
looking to pass.
And he found Lambert, whose 
extended stick indicated he was 
ready for the pass and looking 
to score the easy goal — one that 
would break the 1-1 tie and win 
the Michigan hockey team the 
game.
But the puck slid toward 
Lambert. Then it slid past him. He 
whiffed on the shot and tumbled 
down onto the ice, sprawling on 
all fours as he looked to the distant 
puck, left to wonder what could 
have been in the eventual tie. 
Only a minute later, the puck 
made its way back over to Lambert 
for a chance to redeem himself, all 
alone in the faceoff circle with his 
stick readied. He found himself in 
a similar position as before.
This time, Lambert connected 

with the puck, but it didn’t even 
come close to being on frame. 
He sailed his shot wide right, 
and another scoring chance was 
wasted.
“He fell,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “Nobody around 
him. Good opportunity coming 
down the slot, just whiffs on it. He 
had three or four (whiffs). Once 
you’re not scoring and you’re a 
forward, you really start to press. 
It can get in your head.”
But Lambert wasn’t the only 
Wolverine who couldn’t capitalize 
on opportunities; the team as a 
whole proved unable to finish 
pucks on net.
The Wolverines’ lone goal 
came in the third period off a tip-
in by graduate transfer forward 
Jacob Hayhurst off a shot from 
senior defensemen Luke Martin. 
It seemed their offense had finally 
made it over the hurdle. But it was 
a false hope. Hayhurst’s goal was 
followed up by a string of missed 
opportunities.
One came from senior forward 
Jake Slaker, who fired the puck 
directly into the skate blade of a 
Golden Gopher. Another came 
from Hayhurst. And then three 
of four from Lambert. It didn’t 

matter the offense was getting 
significantly more shots to the 
net than in the previous period 
because it couldn’t finish on them. 
“We’re struggling offensively 
right now,” Pearson said. “Boy oh 
boy, I wish I had some answers, 
but we just have to make sure 
we’re playing well defensively. 
The offense is gonna come, it’s 
just a matter of time, but we’re in a 
funk right now.” 
On top of the fanned shots 
and 
overpassing, 
Michigan’s 
offense has been generated by a 
small group so far this season. On 
Friday night, that was apparent. 
Overall, it had 34 shots on net, but 
most came from a select group 
of four of five players including 
Slaker and freshman defenseman 
Cam York, who collectively had 
eight shots.
“We don’t score a lot of goals,” 
said Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“We’re gonna have to find a way 
to all chip in. We have to start 
doing a better job of that. We had 
some open looks and guys whiff 
on shots, guys falling down. Great 
opportunities. We’re just really, 
really struggling on the offense.”
Contrasting the onslaught of 
offense in the third, in the second 

period Michigan fell flat. It tallied 
only five shots on net despite 
attempting 14, a stark contrast to 
the 18 shots it registered in the 
following 20 minutes.
Rather than shooting the puck, 
the Wolverines opted to pass. And 
pass. And pass. When they did 
manage to put the puck on net, it 
sailed wide or over the crossbar 
or didn’t even connect with a 
player’s stick. 
And it was the wasted chances 
that plagued Michigan. Too many 
times had the extra pass across 
the crease fail and frustrate 
players. The hard-gripped sticks 
only got gripped a little tighter 
each and every failed attempt.
“We’re 
just 
not 
burying 
opportunities,” said Hayhurst. 
“We’re getting chances. As you 
can see we had a ton in the third, 
we’re just not putting them on the 
net.”
After losing three straight 
and 
tying 
Minnesota, 
but 
surrendering the extra point, it’s 
obvious Michigan’s offense needs 
to regroup. 
What’s less obvious is whether 
the Wolverines will be able to do 
so before their standing in the Big 
Ten suffers even further.

After late-game issues, 
‘M’ looks for composure

When both Michigan and 
Appalachian 
State 
players 
shuffled off the court towards 
their respective benches at the 
11:05 mark of the second half on 
Tuesday, everything was going 
according to plan for Juwan 
Howard. 
The 
Wolverines 
held 
a 
26-point advantage, seemingly 
setting the new coach up for 
his first victory. Michigan’s 
leading scorers on the night, 
senior center Jon Teske and 
junior guard Eli Brooks, were 
subbed out for sophomores 
Colin Castleton and Adrien 
Nunez — things looked that 
good.
Then, 
that 
cushion 
evaporated into thin air. Over 
the next ten minutes, the 
Mountaineers 
whittled 
the 
Wolverines’ lead down to just 
five. 
“We just got away from 
the little things,” Teske said. 
“Things got a little tense, we 
just had to relax. I mean we 
were up 30 points.
“We were trying to make 
a quick shot. We had a lot of 
one-pass 
possessions 
where 
we tried to take a quick shot or 
make a quick move.” 
The fastbreak opportunities 
and easy buckets of the first 
half gave way to half-court 
sets and a lack of offensive 
cohesion. 
Against 
the 
3-2 
zone that Appalachian State 
implemented 
at 
halftime, 
Michigan turned the ball over 
nine times and couldn’t hit any 
of the open looks it was given. 
In the face of the offensive 
collapse 
and 
the 
surging 
Mountaineers, 
the 
message 
inside the Wolverines’ huddle 
was simple: composure.
“They’re gonna give you 
open shots in a zone,” Howard 

said. “ ‘You just gotta be 
patient.’ That’s exactly what I 
was telling our guys. ‘Be patient 
with the zone. Let’s make sure 
that we work the basketball 
around and move. And at times 
you see seams, drive it.’ ”
While the rest of Crisler 
Center 
may 
have 
been 
panicked 
and 
frustrated, 
Howard remained positive and 
calm in his first experience 
commanding a huddle as a head 
coach — something his team 
recognized. 
“He was more of a motivator 
than anything,” Brooks said. 
“Coach Howard was definitely 
talking the most. He did a good 
job of controlling the huddle.”
Similar directives came from 
the team’s veterans. Senior 
point guard Zavier Simpson, 
junior forward Isaiah Livers 
and Teske tried to keep the 
team focused and confident. 
“You kinda expect us to hit 
a bump,” Brooks said. “Not 
everything is going to go 
smoothly with a new coach 
and new system. It was just 
keep moving forward, next play 
mentality. Just get back to what 
was successful at the beginning 
of the game.”
Michigan 
never 
fully 
regained its offensive efficiency 
from the first half, but it scored 
when it needed to. Livers 
converted a follow-up layup 
from underneath and Brooks 
went 5-for-6 from the foul line. 
The Wolverines escaped what 
would have been a disastrous 
start 
to 
their 
season 
and 
Howard’s tenure. 
The late-game conversations 
may not have been the sole 
reason 
Michigan 
survived, 

but Howard got a small taste 
of high-stakes coaching on 
Tuesday night. 
And, in a new role and a 
rebuilt roster, that might not be 
such a bad thing.

Michigan drops opener

When 
sophomore 
heavyweight 
Mason 
Parris 
dislocated his finger in the 
midst of his match, there was 
no doubt in his mind that it 
would not affect the rest of his 
wrestling. The crowd went silent 
as the trainer stepped onto the 
mat to reset the finger. Parris, 
after a quick flex of his fingers, 
was ready to wrestle again. It 
was a gruesome embodiment 
of the mentality the Michigan 
wrestling team has adopted 
early this season — effort and 
confidence.
But, in an up-and-down first 
dual meet against 
North Carolina, 
the 
Wolverines 
struggled 
to 
maintain 
this 
resiliency, losing 
19-17. 
After 
a 
dominant 
performance 
from 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Jack 
Medley 
at 
125-pounds, 
winning 10-2, the match-up 
leveled off, with the Tar Heels 
winning the next 2 matches.
“(Jack Medley) wrestled a kid 
who he maybe wasn’t supposed 
to beat, but he really took it to 
him, and I was impressed by 
that,” said 197-pound fifth year 
senior Jackson Striggow.
Things seemed to be looking 
up for Michigan when redshirt 
freshman Nick Freeman took 
the 149-pound match, gaining 
eight points from a near fall and 
two take-downs. However, his 
individual win couldn’t spur 
enough 
momentum 
for 
the 
Wolverines, especially since his 
match led into intermission, 
giving UNC a chance to re-group.
“It was definitely a match that 
we thought we were capable 
of winning, and again it goes 
back to wrestling hard all three 
periods and forcing your offense 
on an opponent,” said Michigan 
coach Sean Bermot. “(Freeman) 
is really capable of doing that. 
He kind of held off until the 3rd 

period.”
The Tar Heels came out of 
intermission strong, winning the 
next four individual matches. 
The most detrimental matchup 
for Michigan was the 174-
pound match between redshirt 
freshman Max Maylor and UNC 
redshirt sophomore Clay Lautt. 
Lautt gained advantage quickly 
and executed a fall just two 
minutes and 20 seconds into the 
first period ending the match and 
giving the Tar Heels an extra six 
team points.
After 
two 
wins 
for 
the 
Wolverines from Jelani Embree 
and Jackson Striggow, it was left 
to Mason Parris to finish out the 
night, who faced UNC’s Andrew 
Gunning in the 
heavyweight 
match.

points, 
Parris 
would 
have 
to complete a 
fall in order to 
win the match. 
Parris 
fought 
hard, and won 
the match 4-0, 
with a takedown 
late in the third period, but it was 
not enough as Michigan fell two 
points short.
The Wolverines were also 
unable to capitalize on bonus 
points, 
something 
heavily 
emphasized by the coaching 
staff. They split the matches 
evenly with the Tar Heels, 
each team winning five, but the 
difference in team score was in 
bonus points.
“I think bonus points are 
always big,” Bermot said. “We’ve 
been working on that stuff a lot. 
We do have some younger guys 
in the lineup, and first-time 
guys competing at (Cliff) Keen 
Arena. I think as they continue 
to become more confident, more 
aggressive, we’re going to see 
more bonus points.”
While the dual result ended in 
a loss for Michigan, both players 
and coaches were hopeful for the 
rest of the season, ready to get 
back to practicing.
Ready to metaphorically reset 
the finger.

There were still 
a lot of things 
we need to 
work on.

November 11, 2019 — 3B

In the second game of the season, 
the Michigan women’s basketball 
team showed again that it has many 
weapons on the roster that can step 
up and score.
The Wolverines got off to a fast 
start in their 77-57 win against 
Bradley on Sunday, going on a 7-0 
run to start the game. Sophomore 
forward Naz Hillmon led the way in 
this stretch with four points and two 
offensive rebounds, and Michigan 
made three of its first five shots.
“I thought Naz just had a different 
mentality altogether today,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico. 
“She came out from the tip just being 
super aggressive. I don’t even mean 
if that was her getting touches with 
the basketball, I just mean from a 
rebounding perspective, she was all 
over the place from the beginning of 
the game.”
A Braves timeout two minutes 
into the quarter slowed Michigan’s 
momentum, and a bucket was hard 
to come by for the rest of the quarter 
for the Wolverines. Michigan made 
just two of its last 15 shots, and only 
led Bradley by seven after the first 
quarter.
The Wolverines continued to 
struggle offensively early in the 
second quarter, but with 6:45 left, 
sophomore guard Amy Dilk hit a 
jump shot in the paint that sparked 
a 7-0 run for Michigan over a two-
minute span. While Dilk carried the 
load offensively, scoring all seven 
points, the Wolverines’ entire lineup 
played stingy defense, forcing three 
turnovers.
Michigan closed out the half 
with strong shooting, highlighted by 
3-pointers from Dilk, junior guard 

Priscilla Smeenge, freshman center 
Izabel Varejão and sophomore 
forward Emily Kiser. The team 
took a 38-21 lead into the half, and 
after shooting just 25 percent from 
the floor in the first quarter, the 
Wolverines made 50 percent of their 
shots in the second, and shot five-
for-seven from 3-point range.
The beginning of the third 
quarter saw Hillmon take over. 
She scored eight of Michigan’s first 
10 points, six of which were in the 
paint. Hillmon finished with 16 
points and 12 rebounds.
But three minutes into the 
quarter, Bradley showed life. The 
Braves were able to outscore the 
Wolverines in the third quarter due 
to stellar 3-point shooting, making 
six and cutting the deficit to 14.
The 
shift 
in 
momentum 
continued into the fourth quarter. 
Bradley guard Gabi Haack drew a 
foul on a made shot under the basket 
and hit her free throw, narrowing 
Michigan’s lead to 11. Hillmon 
picked up her third foul on the next 
possession, giving the Braves an 
opportunity to cut the lead to single 
digits on the next possession.
But 
the 
Wolverines 
quickly 
quieted any chance of a comeback. 
They forced a turnover on the 
ensuing possession and freshman 
guard Michelle Sidor drained a 
3-point shot, catalyzing a 12-2 run 
that gave Michigan a 21-point lead 
and put Bradley away. 
“It was nice to see us have to 
rally and have to get a stop on the 
defensive end, and … have to be 
able to execute some plays down 
on the offensive end,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We don’t have a tremendous 
amount of experience in terms of 
senior minutes played or junior 
minutes played, so a lot of these kids 
are going through stuff for their first 

time, and I thought they responded 
really well tonight.”
Sidor accounted for eight points 
during this period after shooting 
one-for-four in the first half and 
spending an extended period of 
time on the bench — finishing with 
11 points in just 17 minutes.
“The confidence … that she has, 
to not hesitate after missing a couple 
shots, being out, and then having to 
come in and boom, you got a touch, 
now you gotta make a play,” Barnes 
Arico said. “For a freshman to 
have the confidence in themselves 
to be able to do that I think is just 
tremendous.”
Added Dilk: “She can obviously 
shoot the ball but also she works 
off of the bounce as well. So just 
having those two options, it puts 
the defense in a threat, so you don’t 

really know what way her scoring is 
coming from.”
While early shooting woes hurt 
the Wolverines, their ability to catch 
fire at any moment meant the result 
was never in doubt.

After jumping to a nine-
point lead early in the second 
quarter, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s offense hit a 
rough patch. 
The 
Wolverines 
endured 
three 
scoreless 
minutes, 
marked by unforced errors and 
turnovers. So naturally, they 
turned to one of their leaders 
— sophomore guard Amy Dilk 
— for a spark. She responded.
In a span of less than two 
minutes, she hit a mid-range 
jumper, a layup and a 3-pointer, 
stretching 
Michigan’s 
lead 
to 12 and putting the Braves’ 
run to bed en route to a 77-57 

victory on Sunday. 
In 
a 
game 
with 
strong 
performances 
across 
the 
board, Dilk and sophomore 
forward Naz Hillmon led the 
team with 13 and 16 points, 

respectively. 
For Dilk, Sunday’s game was 
mostly a continuation of her 
play from Friday night against 
Western Michigan, where she 
registered 12 points and 11 
rebounds.
But for Hillmon, a big game 
Sunday was crucial to her 
confidence, as she was mostly 
limited Friday because of foul 
trouble. 
“It feels really good just to 
be able to get 
my feet wet,” 
Hillmon said. 
“Sometimes 
when you’re in 
foul 
trouble, 
it messes up 
your rhythm a 
little bit. You 
have to figure 
out a couple 
of things from 
the 
bench, 
but it was definitely a great 
opportunity for me in the 
beginning of the season to 
actually get in the rhythm of 
things.”
Dilk 
and 
Hillmon’s 
contributions on the glass were 
just as crucial to the victory as 
their scoring. Hillmon led the 
team with 12 rebounds — eight 
of which came off the offensive 
glass — earning her first of 
likely 
many 
double-doubles 
this season. Dilk followed suit 
on the defensive side, picking 
up nine rebounds, falling one 
short of her second consecutive 
double-double. 
While 
putting 
up 
big 
numbers 
off 
the 
glass 
is 
nothing 
new 
for 
Hillmon, 
Dilk has drastically improved 
her rebounding thus far after 

averaging 3.7 rebounds per 
game last season. If she can 
continue to pick up boards 
at this rate, it could open 
up 
opportunities 
for 
her 
teammates to run in transition 
and lead to some personal 
accolades for Dilk. 
“I think the challenge for 
(Dilk) is ‘Hey, you could be 
a triple double. You can get 
a triple double every night,’ 
” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes 
Arico. 
“ 
… 
Defensive 
rebounding 
is 
effort. You gotta 
go in there, you 
gotta mix it up, 
and you gotta get 
the effort to go to 
the ball, and she 
has made great 
effort the last two 
games of being 
able to do that.” 
The effort was certainly 
there 
for 
both 
Dilk 
and 
Hillmon, even beyond their 
rebounding 
numbers. 
A 
number of times throughout 
the game, Dilk was the first 
down the floor on the fast 
break or off a Bradley turnover 
to pick up an easy bucket in 
transition. 
Meanwhile, Hillmon led a 
punishing interior on defense, 
one that held the Braves to 
just 18 points in the paint 
— a number dwarfed by the 
Wolverines’ 34. This trend 
will need to continue for 
Michigan to improve on its No. 
148 ranking in scoring defense 
from last year. 
But for now, the Wolverines 
at least know they can count on 
these two in tough situations.

‘M’ drops heartbreaker to Penn State

A hard-fought scoreless battle 
going into the second half put the 
third-seeded Michigan women’s 
soccer team in a familiar position.
Sunday’s 
match 
against 
fourth-seeded Penn State (15-6-1 
overall, 8-3-0 Big Ten) mirrored 
the Wolverines’ (15-5-1, 8-2-1) 
semifinal win two days earlier. In 
an overtime battle, the narrative 
was similar but the result was 
not, as the Wolverines fell to 
Penn State, 2-1, in the Big Ten 
Championship game. 
The elation of an overtime 
outcome was for Penn State to 
enjoy.
The 82nd minute alone made 
up for 81 minutes of a lackluster 
game. The 0-0 deadlock changed 
within the span of 40 seconds. In a 
somewhat controversial call, Penn 
State committed an own goal when 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Raleigh 
Loughman passed from the left 
side into the middle. Intended 
for redshirt senior defender Sura 
Yekka, the pass ricocheted off 
midfielder 
Payton 
Linnehan’s 
foot into the goal. The goal was 
initially called back for offsides, 
but after review, Michigan was on 
the board.
The Wolverines did not hold the 
1-0 lead for long when, 40 seconds 
later, 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Skylar Anderson was called for 
a foul. This set up a penalty kick 
for midfielder Sam Coffey. The 
outstretched hands of junior 
goalkeeper 
Hillary 
Beal 
just 
missed the ball. 
Michigan’s lead was gone, and 
the game was, once again, tied. 
For the second time in three 
days, Michigan was headed to 
overtime tied 1-1. Once again, 
all the action happened within 
a few seconds. In a beautifully 
developed play, Loughman passed 
the ball into the middle, putting 
junior midfielder Sarah Stratigakis 
in perfect position for a header — 
landing just wide of the goal.
The Nittany Lions took this 

miss immediately down the field, 
where Linnehan looked to avenge 
her own goal, finding herself 
alone in front of the net. Beal 
was aggressive and came out of 
the goal to try and steal the ball. 
Linnehan chipped the ball over 
Beal’s head for the game-winner.
“(It was) two very good teams 
very organized and disciplined,” 
said Michigan coach Jennifer 
Klein. “You just got to handle the 
ebbs and flows of the game, and I 
thought the team handled it well. 
Towards the end of regulation, I 
thought we got a little bit flustered. 
We regained our composure and 
they just got an opportunity and 
they took advantage of it.”
Playing 
overtime 
in 
two 
consecutive games is no easy feat, 
but Klein believes her team was 
not overworked.
During the first half, neither 
team could take advantage as they 
shared the time of possession and 
were even with seven shots. 
The Wolverines then came out 
of halftime strong and controlled 
the ball for the beginning of 
the half. The defense helped by 
making a few big stops. Klein made 
a personnel change to help her 
defense, shifting junior midfielder 
Nicki Hernandez to center back. 
Hernandez made an impact in all 
facets of the game, taking two of 
the team’s 14 shots.
“One of the best qualities about 
Nicki is her work rate on both sides 
of the ball,” Klein said. “She has a 

great defensive presence so we 
made the switch.” 
Beal’s play was pivotal in 
making the game as close as it 
was. The goals were tied for the 
most she has allowed this season, 
but her five incredible saves bailed 
the Wolverines out on multiple 
occasions. 
“I think she really made some 
unbelievable saves and was just a 
bit unfortunate for the goal at the 
end,” Klein said. “I’ve just been 
so proud of her throughout the 
season and the growth that she’s 
had at her time here at Michigan.”
The Wolverines suffered a 
minor set back in the 28th minute 
when 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Meredith Haakenson was subbed 
out after an apparent ankle injury. 
Haakenson returned in the 75th 
minute. 
Their inclusion in the NCAA 
Tournament is all but guaranteed, 
merely awaiting their location 
and opponent. The Wolverines 
will find out their postseason 
fate during the selection show on 
Monday. 
If you look back as little as two 
years ago, Michigan was in a very 
different place. 
“This year I asked them what 
makes it Michigan,” Klein said. 
“They established the habits of 
what we want this culture and 
program to be. They’ve done the 
work to be a team that is competing 
for championships. Hopefully, it 
will carry through the NCAAs.”

Set piece dominance paves way

Does ‘the hot hand’ exist?
Apparently it does – if only on 
the field hockey turf. All signs 
of this statistical question mark 
were confirmed as Penn State 
(8-12 overall, 4-4 Big Ten) – a team 
that opened the season with seven 
straight losses – came within an 
overtime goal of stealing the Big 
Ten Tournament championship 
from the likes of top-seeded 
Maryland and Iowa.
The first stop of this improbable 
march was a 2-1 victory last 
Thursday against Michigan (13-6, 
5-3) a team which has experienced 
nearly the opposite trajectory of 
the Nittany Lions. 
The Wolverines endured one 
of the toughest regular season 
schedules in the country. Victories 
against Connecticut, Maryland 
and Iowa were Michigan’s most 
notable notches on the rifle. Less 
surprising was a 3-1 victory at 
home against a seemingly hapless 
Penn State squad a few weeks 
ago, marked by four periods of 
consistent possession and even 
scoring.
The Nittany Lions returned 
the favor with a home win of their 
own, knocking the Wolverines out 
of the conference tournament and 
threatening to abort the remainder 
of their 2019 campaign. But after 

four uneasy days, Michigan found 
itself a beneficiary of an at-large 
bid for the NCAA tournament. The 
team will travel to Trager Stadium 
in Kentucky to take on Louisville 
in their first round match this 
weekend.
The Michigan field hockey 
program declined to make coach 
Marcia 
Pankratz 
or 
players 
available to The Daily for this story.
The 
Wolverines’ 
aggressive 
tactics made them a tough out. 
Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz 
began making substitutions just six 
minutes into the contest and would 
continue to do so throughout – in 
total, 18 players received minutes. 
The numerical results were 
similar to those from the meeting 
of these two teams a few weeks 
ago: Michigan recorded consistent 
quantities of shots on target and 
penalty corners every quarter, 
no doubt thanks to the fresh 
legs created by frequent player 
replacement. On the defensive 
side of the ball, the Wolverines 
managed to stymie the Nittany 
Lions for 57 out of 60 minutes. 
The three-minute lapse was all 
Penn State would need, forcing a 
pair of penalty corners in the third 
quarter’s first minutes. The danger 
of the first was mitigated by the 
Wolverines’ defensive five before 
a shot on target was recorded, but 
Michigan could not drive the ball 
out of its defensive third before the 

second penalty corner was created.
This 
one 
would 
prove 
troublesome. 
Sophomore 
goalkeeper Anna Spieker saved 
the first shot, but not the following 
attempt by Paityn Wirth. Minutes 
later, off another penalty corner, 
Meghan Reese scored on a one-
touch volley well within the circle. 
The Wolverines struck back late 
in the third quarter thanks to a 
penalty corner of their own. Junior 
defender Halle O’Neill notched 
her second goal of the season 
thanks to her direct receipt of the 
corner from sophomore midfielder 
Kathryn Peterson. 
Michigan’s control of the game, 
the two penalty corner episodes 
notwithstanding, 
propounded 
the frustration of a close loss 
in an important context. The 
Wolverines outshot the Nittany 
Lions nine to four, racking up at 
least one shot per quarter. Penn 
State goalkeeper Brie Barraco 
made eight saves, keeping the 
Nittany Lions afloat despite the 
apparent incompetence of their 
back line. 
With four minutes to play, 
Pankratz called Spieker out of 
goal in a last ditch effort to tie the 
game. The decision failed to move 
the needle offensively, and the 
Wolverines ducked out of State 
College – and the conference 
tournament – as the first victims of 
Penn State’s hot hand.

The first goal of the game 
went 
against 
Michigan 
and 
was scored from a drive by 
Minnesota forward Ben Meyers. 
He took a shot but it was blocked 
by freshman defenseman Cam 
York, who sprawled on the ice 
to prevent the shot or pass. The 

puck leaked away from the net, 
but 
redshirt 
junior 
forward 
Luke Morgan, who had also 
instinctively laid out on the ice, 
accidentally kicked the puck 
toward the net and to a waiting 
Gopher, unguarded and ready. 
Brannon McManus tapped the 
puck in for an easy redirect goal.
And the second goal was one 
unlike anything Pearson had 
seen in his 30 years at Michigan. 

On a dump-in, the puck hit the 
boards but bounced off in an 
awkward fashion. Strauss Mann 
had been waiting behind the net 
for the puck to curl around as 
it normally does. But the puck 
instead bounced in front of the 
net — an empty net — and allowed 
for an easy scoring opportunity 
for the Gophers.
The third period saw an 
offensive-zone 
dominance 
by 

the Wolverines. Nineteen shots 
on net, and midway through 
the period, one finally found its 
intended target, a much-needed 
break.
Beecher corralled the puck 
off the boards and cut around 
the net. He created separation 
between 
and 
the 
pursuing 
defenders and surveyed the ice. 
A quick pass to an open Emil 
Ohrwall resulted the Wolverines’ 

first and only goal of the night.
The barrage of attacks that 
followed, 
and 
the 
pressure 
created, 
would 
be 
ruled 
meaningless as an empty-net goal 
in the dying seconds of the game 
ended any chances of a comeback 
and the words of Pearson and the 
players after the game rang clear.
“We’re doing so many things 
well right now,” Martin said. 
“And just have to keep our focus 

on those and trying to — because 
the 
tide’s 
gonna 
turn. 
The 
floodgates are gonna open.”
Added Pearson: “The offense 
will come.”
The shared sentiment was 
that as long as they continue 
to play defense the way they 
did, the goals will come — and 
presumably, the wins will as 
well. 
But on Saturday, neither did.

HOCKEY
From Page 1B


in Indiana decided to run the gamut of tests and 

eventually came to their conclusion.

“(Cameron) didn’t understand why his brother 

was kind of delayed,” Lynn said, “and I just told 

him ‘Your brother’s a little different. He learns 

a little different. Everybody learns things at 

different times of their lives.’ ”

That understanding did little to quell day-

to-day struggles. When Cameron was in eighth 

grade, he was an ascendant wrestling star, 

eventually winning the county title. Scouts 

flocked to see him wrestle.

One afternoon, he was slated to wrestle in 

Pemberton Heights, a particularly high-profile 

meet near the end of the season. Aaron was having 

a good day, Lynn recalls, so she brought him along. 

It was always a guessing game, evaluating the 

pros and cons of a given environment, coming to a 

conclusion then keeping her fingers crossed. 

That day, she brought Aaron into the gym. 

Things subsequently went south.

“Aaron just started bucking and screaming and 

crying, and I just couldn’t stay in there,” Lynn 

said. “Because a lot of people don’t know, they 

just stare at you and, ‘Gosh, why doesn’t she make 

that little boy be quiet?’ Or, ‘That boy needs to be 

spanked.’ You hear people whispering. 

“And Cameron just had this look on his face.”

That was hardly abnormal. Aaron struggled 

with the noises and crowds at Cameron’s sporting 

events — the buzzer at wrestling meets, the gun at 

track meets, the whistles at football games. 

“There were situations like that where I’m not 

sure if Cameron was looking into the crowd to 

look for me, but I know there were several times 

he was looking for and didn’t see me there,” Lynn 

said. “So he was like, ‘Were you even at my game?’ 

”

There was never any bottled-up resentment 

baked into that frustration for Cameron, but 

during high school something changed for him. 

Cameron wanted his brother to be able to go 

places, do things, have those experiences that 

embody childhood. And, despite the nine-year 

age gap, he wanted them to share those ventures 

together. As brothers do.

So Cameron took matters into his own hands. 

One afternoon, Cameron asked his mom if 

he could stay after school to watch a volleyball 

match. Lynn went down to the school to pick 

up Aaron and await the end of the match, so she 

could bring Cameron, too. But this day, Cameron 

decided, would be different. 

“I fully planned on going out there and hanging 

out in the parking lot, like I’d always done,” Lynn 

recalled. “Then Cameron was like, ‘Bring Aaron 

in here.’ ”

With his mom apprehensive, Cameron brought 

Aaron into the gym. The two watched the game 

together, Cameron sure to prep Aaron when a 

buzzer was imminent. Aaron loved hanging out 

with his big brother. Cameron cared deeply about 

his progress. It didn’t take long for Cameron to 

realize it was working. 

“Cameron would point up to the shot clock,” 

Lynn recalled, “and be like, ‘OK, Aaron, 20 

seconds til the buzzer.’ And Aaron would be like 

‘OK, 20 seconds.’

“He would keep saying to himself over and 

over and over ‘Here comes the buzzer. The 

buzzer’s coming.’ Or, ‘They’re gonna blow the 

whistle. They’re gonna sound the buzzer.’ He 

would say it out loud and repeat it over and over 

to himself, and Cameron would do it too, to try to 

prep himself for the noises so he wouldn’t be so 

scared.”

Going to games together became a regular 

venture, a brotherly bonding experience in more 

ways than one.

“Even though we’re like nine years apart, 

it kind of feels like we’re twins sometimes,” 

Cameron said. “We go everywhere together, we 

laugh at everything together. It seems like we just 

do everything together. 

“And especially when he was diagnosed with 

autism, I just wanted to keep him around me to 

make more memories and build a better bond, so 

that he really knew I was there for him. When he 

was developing autism, it kind of kicked us into 

the next gear with our bond and relationship.”

Slowly, Aaron grew more comfortable in big 

crowds and with loud noises, so long as he had 

advanced warning. Instead of a yell, Aaron would 

confront his anxiety with a nervous chuckle. The 

progress was real and tangible. During Cameron’s 

junior year, Aaron started attending his football 

games, a direct result of Cameron’s efforts.

At that point, McGrone was rapidly evolving 

into a star. Aaron would come to games, at times 

still wary of potential pitfalls, but thrilled to see 

his brother. When Cameron’s team would score 

a touchdown — fireworks and cannons booming 

— Lynn would often see Cameron turn around to 

look at Aaron’s reaction.

Lynn Redd sat and waited for an inevitable 

call. 

It was July 4, 2018, and her two sons were out 

at a nearby fireworks show in their hometown 

of Indianapolis. For many, it’s a routine 

Independence Day venture. For sophomore 

linebacker Cameron McGrone and his younger 

brother, Aaron Redd, it was a monumental step.

What is routine for many is not routine for 

Aaron. When he was four years old, Aaron 

was diagnosed with autism. He’s 10 years 

old and attends public school with some 

accommodations, but Lynn estimates his 

development aligns more closely with that 

of a second or third-grader. Throughout his 

life, these challenges have manifested largely 

in outbursts triggered by big crowds with 

loud noises — a commonality for many on the 

spectrum.

Cameron has long been steadfast in his desire 

to help his brother and lead him to new heights. 

Last summer, his break from football coincided 

with July 4th; he saw a window of opportunity.

“(Aaron has) always loved the look of 

fireworks,” Cameron said, “just the sounds he 

could never get over.”

When Cameron speaks about his younger 

brother — about his challenges and feats, his 

personality and gifts — he does so with an 

inimitable pride. He is, in other words, like 

many doting big brothers. There are things 

Aaron has accomplished that Cameron never 

thought possible, and he wears those feats as a 

collective badge of pride.

What’s clear, in speaking with his family, 

is that Cameron has been as instrumental in 

forging those feats as anyone. July 4, 2018 was a 

prime example.

As was her natural instinct, Lynn’s mind 

sprang to the possible downfalls that evening. 

She clung to her phone. Could Aaron really 

handle this step? Or would he be overwhelmed? 

Would Cameron be able to handle a meltdown? 

As the fireworks began lining the sky, 

Cameron pulled out his phone, opened Snapchat 

and turned it around. Aaron scanned the 

skyline, his head craned squarely ahead, sound-

cancelling headphones attached to his ears. He 

was locked in.

After taking a quick video, Cameron typed 

out “Lil Bros first firework show” with two 

heart emojis. He saved it and sent it along to his 

mother.

Lynn opened up the text from Cameron, 

watched the video and started to cry.

“I know when David (Redd) and I are long 

gone, Aaron will be taken care of,” Lynn said. 

“Because Cameron loves him and he’s loyal to 

him, and he’ll make sure he’s taken care of.”

he was elated when Aaron was born.

It didn’t take long for the family to realize

a few months old, he started crying frequently, 

“being kind of inconsolable,” Lynn describes. He 

was mute until the age of four, forcing Cameron 

and his parents to find alternate ways to 

communicate. They started using sign language, 

but there were still gaps, particularly for a 

boy desperately hoping to forge a relationship 

with his lone sibling. Lynn taught Aaron to call 

Cameron “Bubby” because Cameron was too 

hard to pronounce. In time, Cameron started 

referring to Aaron as “Lil Bubby”.

“Cameron didn’t know — he was frustrated 

mostly because he wanted to play with his 

brother, but sometimes Aaron would have 

temper tantrums and fits where we all couldn’t
