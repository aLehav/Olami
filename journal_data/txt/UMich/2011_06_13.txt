LEGAL DISPUTE
Michigan
to rule on
lifer law
ACLU says not
offering parole to
juveniles violates
constitutional rights
By SARAH-ALSADEN
Daily News Editor
The United States District
Court for the Eastern District of
Michigan will issue a ruling soon
on a complaint filed that challeng-
es a law mandating that juveniles
spend life in prison without the
opportunity of parole for commit-
ting a felony or first-degree mur-
der.
The complaint - which is sup-
ported by the Michigan chapter
of the American Civil Liberties
Union and is being - was filed in
November by Ann Arbor attorney
Deborah Labelle on behalf of nine
plaintiffs who were under the age
of eighteen at the time of their sen-
tencing.
According to Rod Hansen, a
spokesman for the U.S. District
Court, the complaint does not seek
to challenge the convictions, but
rather challenge the constitution-
ality of sentencing juveniles to life
in prison without parole.
Hansen said the complaint
argues that mandatory life without
parole for juveniles violates the 8th
and 14th amendments of the Con-
stitution - namely that in addition
to being cruel and unusual punish-
ment, it is also the denial of due
process to not have an opportunity
for parole.

In anticipation of
primary, candidates
discuss city issues
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
With the August primary
election just a few months in the
future, Ann Arbor City Council
members and their challengers
gathered Saturday morning at the
Ann Arbor Community Center
to participate in a forum on local
issues.

The event was one of the Ann
Arbor City Democratic Party's
first campaign events leading up
to the primary, and featured eight
City Council hopefuls - four
incumbents and four newcomers
- who took part in the roundtable
discussion moderated by Demo-
cratic Party Co-Chairman Mike
Henry.
Among issues discussed at
the forum were the fate of the
disputed Library Lot - a city-
owned plot located on 319 South
Fifth Avenue where a $50 million
underground parking lot is cur-
rently under construction, the

relationship between the city and
the University and budget cuts
that recently slashed jobs from
both the fire and police depart-
ments.
With the future of the Library
Lot still undecided, participants at
Saturday's forum exchanged ideas
for use of the land. Ingrid Ault,
executive editor of Think Local
First - a business that promotes
local companies in Washtenaw
County - and a challenger of Ste-
phen Kunselman (D-Ward 3), said
the lot is "arguably the most valu-
able piece of land in Washtenaw

CAMPUJS COMMUNITY
Students demonstrate political support
by volunteering for electoral campaigns

Desire to see change
prompts political
activism for 2012
presidential election
By AUSTIN WORDELL
Daily StaffReporter
While the idea of long hours
of work for no pay isn't enticing
for many individuals, University
students who sayithey are driven
by their faith in America's politi-
cal institutions to improve the
country are readily volunteering
in electoral politics.
Members of the University
community said students play a
pivotal role in shaping politics
through both voting and actively
participating in elections, and
that student involvement will
continue to be important in the
upcoming 2012 presidential elec-
tion.
Edie Goldenberg, professor of
political science and public pol-
icy, said as campaigning for the
2012 presidential election begins,
college students will prove to be
instrumental in assisting the can-
didates in garnering support.
"Students are valuable as
presidential campaign volunteers
because they have time, energy
and will work for free," Golden-
berg said.
According to Michael
Heaney, assistant professor of

organizational studies and politi-
cal science, politicians often look
toward college campuses for
volunteers and voters because
students are already in a central
location and are often organized
according to political beliefs.
"One reason why students
are sought after is because there
are some strategies that can be
pursued to go after them, which
is you can target them on par-
ticular campuses," Heaney said.
"You have student groups that
have been organized around pro-
moting one candidate or anoth-
er."
Heaney said he believes the
major point of contention during
the 2012 presidential campaign
will be the economy, adding that
the state of economic affairs lead-
ing up to election day will play a
large role in determining voter
sentiment toward incumbent
United States President Barack
Obama.
"If the economy really picks
up steam and you see a lot of eco-
nomic growth between now and
the next summer, then you are
going to see a strong likelihood
of Obama getting re-elected,"
Heaney said. "If you have any
kind of increasing unemploy-
ment or any kind of downturn,
then that provides a really strong
opportunity for a Republican pick
up."
Amanda Caldwell, chair of
the University's chapter of the
College Democrats, said she

believes students volunteer for
political campaigns because
they are passionate about the
issues.
"I volunteer because I believe
in the power of the political sys-
tem to build a more just, compas-
sionate, and sustainable nation,"
she said. "It is important to
remember that our elected offi-
cials not only shape our future,
but also reflect on who we are as
a society."
Anton Dirnberger, secretary
of the University's chapter of
the College Republicans, echoed
Caldwell's sentiment that student
volunteers donate their time out
of a strong belief in the parties
and campaigns rather than for a
personal career boost.
"Campaign volunteers that
come from the University of
Michigan College Republicans
are most assuredly not just look-
ing for a resume booster," Dirn-
berger said. "They understand
the effect our government has on
our everyday life and know how
vital their participation is to see-
ing the results they want."
Caldwell added that stu-
dent volunteers who don't wish
to practice electoral politics as
a career still see the effect that
politics can have on their chosen
career path.
"Many of our volunteers are,
for example, pre-med or in a pro-
gram for the environment who do
not plan on going into politics, but
volunteer because they support

the Democratic Party on health
care and environmental policy,
respectively," Caldwell said.
Dirnberger added that stu-
dent volunteers are often valued
for the unique skills they offer
campaigns, particularly in tech-
nical areas such as social net-
working.
"Students are key to presiden-
tial campaigns because they are
extremely motivated, educated
individuals that can appeal to
other younger voters," Dirnberg-
er said. "This is huge, especially
on the grassroots level of cam-
paigns."
Despite the importance stu-
dents have shown to have in elec-
tions, Goldenberg said it has been
speculated there will be a decline
in student participation and vot-
ing in the upcoming presidential
election in comparison to the
2008 presidential elections.
"I wouldn't be surprised to
see (turnout) lower than in '08
when Obamas 'change' message
generated a lot of excitement,"
Goldenberg said.
However student volunteers
with College Democrats and Col-
lege Republicans said they are not
expecting any decline in student
participation for the upcoming
election.
Both Dirnberger and Caldwell
said they don't believe Obama has
not lost the youth appeal that
made students favor him heavily
in the 2008 election.
"We are not expecting to see a
decline in either student partici-
pation as volunteers or voters,"
Caldwell said. "Obama continues
to energize students."
Dirnberger added he thinks
the actions of the Obama admin-
istration will lead to even more
student involvement from the
College Republicans.
"While others may be expect-
ing a decline in student participa-
tion, the College Republicans at
the University of Michigan are
most definitely not," Dirnberger
said. "President Obama and the
Democrats' policies have been
our most effective recruiting
tools. Our membership has sky-
rocketed since 2008 and contin-
ues to grow. I know for certain
that college Republicans are very
anxious for 2012."

County" and recommended that
the city instead use the land for
mixed-use development.
However, Kunselman said the
land should be transferred to the
private sector, as did newcomer
Marwan Issa, technology direc-
tor at Global Education Excellence
- a company that works toward
developing quality education in
Michigan - who will be contest-
ing Kunselman. Issa said the land
could become "a hub for startup
companies."
Both Issa and Tim Hull, a Uni-
versity alum who will be vying
for Stephen Rapundalo's seat
(D-Ward 2), said they hope to see
expanded partnerships between
the city and the University in the
future. Issa said it is crucial that
the two strengthen their relation-
ship, adding that the city has not
been fully utilizing the resources
of the University.
Hull said this is partially
because the. connection between

the University and the commu-
nity is hindered by students who
feel "alienated" by the city because
often times their main contact
occurs when receiving citations
from police for engaging in acts
like underage drinking.
Inan interview after the forum,
Hull said he hopes University stu-
dents can build a rapport with the
city through civic engagement,
and in doing so encourage them to
stay in Ann Arbor after graduating
in an effort to prevent brain drain
- the exodus of students from the
state following graduation.
"I want the city to more engage
the student body such that we can
get more of them to stay in Ann
Arbor," Hull said. "We have a lot of
educated people coming out of the
University of Michigan and I think
it's important to kind of encourage
them to stay here. I think there's a
lot of opportunity here."
Sean Walser, LSA junior and
External Relations Committee
Chair for the Michigan Student
Assembly, was one of few students
in attendance and said in an inter-
view after the event that he came

to the forum to hear from the can-
didates, adding that he hopes the
city will forge a stronger relation-
ship with the University in the
future.
"Obviously the University is a
huge part of this community, and I
want to make sure that Ann Arbor
residents are aware of the facilities
that we offer," Walser said.
Michael Benson, president of
Rackham Student Government,
said in an interview that the inat-
tention of students to city govern-
ment policies such as housing and
parking rates discourages civic
participation.
"A lot of the graduate students
in particular don't realize city gov-
ernment (creates) many of the poli-
cies and priorities that affect them
in their daily lives," Benson said.
Benson added he hopes to draw
attention to the August primary by
sending e-mails to the graduate
student body reminding them to
vote. He said he is also in the pro-
cess of scheduling a similar forum
this summer hosted by Rackham
Student Government.

GRATZI FOR THE DEAL
N - E C ' - .

ACLU
From Page 1
Labelle, who is the lead coun-
sel on the case and a cooperating
attorney with the ACLU, said she
couldn't speculate about the rul-
ing of the case - which is cur-
rently being reviewed by Judge
John Corbett O'Meara, the fed-
eral district court judge in Ann
Arbor - though she expects the
ruling will be available soon.
She added that the complaint
challenges the juvenile lifer law
by arguing that it is unconstitu-
tional to give juveniles the most
severe form of punishment that
an adult criminal could receive
without considering their youth.
"The U.S. Constitution is vio-
lated by placing youth in prison
for the rest of their lives until
they die, givingthem the harshest
punishment you can give to any-
one, including an adult who is a
serial murderer," Labelle said.
Labelle said the law should
be revised since it does not allow
the court to consider the age and
developmental capabilities of the
juveniles.
"This is not a get out of jail
free," Labelle said. "We all know
that youth are impetuous, that
their brains are not fully devel-
oped, that they have enormous
peer pressure on them..."
By placing juveniles in jail
without parole, she said, the law
fails to acknowledge that the juve-
niles have not finished developing
and deserve another opportunity
to live as a citizen in society.
"What we're saying is ... they
grow up," she said. "You need to
look at them when they grow up
and say have you matured? Have
you been rehabilitated? Do you
deserve a second chance? That's
all the lawsuit is about."
Jennifer Bishop-Jenkins, one
of the founders of the National
Organization of Victims of Juve-
nile Lifers, said she was disap-
pointed with how the complaint
was filed, since the families of the
victims of the crimes committed
by the plaintiffs were not notified
that the complaint was filed.
"These families have a stake
in this discussion," Bishop-Jen-
kins said. "They have a right to
know that it's going on, they have
a right to come and be heard ...
The fact that we're not being told
about this campaign to retroac-

tively undo these sentences, this
is very troubling to victim's fami-
lies."
Bishop-Jenkins said she
believes the reports published
by the Michigan chapter of the
ACLU were "disingenuous"
because they only tell the plain-
tiff's stories and contradict court
and police records,'as well as fail
to consult the victims to hear
their side of the story.
"They are publishing these
very sympathetic sounding pro-
paganda pieces about these cases
and they are not actually publish-
ing the full facts," Bishop-Jenkins
said.
She added she believes that
both national policy and pub-
lic opinion support the sentence
of life in prison without parole,
which will make it difficult for
the court to rule in favor of the
complaint.
"We are confident that the
Eastern District Court is going to
find what has already been found
by court after court after court
across this country that have
affirmed the constitutionality of
life without parole for teens who
commit premeditated murder,"
she said. "It's never been over-
turned by a court, ever, and we
are sure and confident that it will
not be overturned this time."
Labelle, however, said the
general sentiment of people
within the state of Michigan ig
different regarding policy over
the issue. According to Labelle,
Wayne State University did
extensive polling a few years ago
and found that 95 percent of those
surveyed in Michigan opposed
life in prison without parole.
Labelle said there are many
family members of victims that
strongly support a change in the
law that sentences juveniles to
life in prison without a chance for
parole.
"There are many judges and
victims' family members that
have come forward and said
either we had no idea that these
kids would die in prison or we
don't believe this honors the
memory of our family member
who died," Labelle said. "It's a
double tragedy. Two wrongs don't
make a right."
Attorney General Bill
Schuette (R-Mich.) - whose
office serves as council to the
state - declined to comment on
the pending case.

Inadequate reform
Education must reward, not punish teachers.
n Thursday, the state House approved legislation that
makes it more difficult for teachers to reach and main-
tain tenured status while making it easier for low-quali-
ty teachers to be dismissed. While the House bills have laudable
measures, especially where it minimizes the importance of
seniority, the generalized and vague nature of the legislation's
language may limit its potential. The lack of explicit outlines
for deeming teachers effective or ineffective, along with the
shortfall of incentives for educators, ultimately outweigh the
positive aspects of the legislation. The state Senate must not let
these bills become law.

Ken Robinson, education expert
and creativity guru, claims in a
thought-provoking video from TED, a
non-profit organi-
zation that encour-
ages the spread
of new ideas, that
the current school
system educates us
out of our creativ-
ity. Robinson illus-
trates his case with ERIK
an example: "Ask a TORENBERG
class of first grad-
ers which of them
thinks they're creative and they'll all
put their hands up. Ask a group of col-
lege seniors this same question and
most of them won't."
Your perception of your own cre-
ativity - the ability to generate origi-
nal ideas that add value - is often a
self-fulfilling prophecy. It's misguided
to view it as somethingyoueither have
or you don't. Like any skill, it can be
deconstructed and deliberately prac-
ticed. Through personal experience,
as well as consulting various books
and dogs, I'veaidentified three habits
that foster creativity.
The first habit: Write your ideas
down. Carry a notebook with you
everywhere. Your brain is good at
creating ideas. Paper is good for
storing them.
For example, if you're working on a
paper or a group project, write ideas
and insights consistently. Often times
if you start a project in the morning
and take a break, ideas will come to
you throughout the day, like when
you're in the shower or on a walk. If
you don't write them down you'll lose
them. My column isn't solely writ-
ten in a four-hour chunk. It's spread
out over several unexpected "a-ha"
moments - a response here, a rebuttal
to a potential argument there.
The second habit: Review your
ideas at least once a week. Review-
ing your ideas allows you to notice
patterns in your thoughts, encour-
aging you to connect them. You can
read over them or use tools like the
mobile application Thoughtback.
Every time you add a thought to
the app, it sends you back a random
thought you've had in the past.
Steve Johnson, author of "Where
Good Ideas Come From," explains this
phenomenon. Good ideas don't come
from solitary "Eureka" moments.
They are the connection of tangential
ideas and experiences that have been
accumulated. You read this article
here, talk to this person there and
then leave your head in the clouds for
a bit and before you know it, you've
got a narrative. Or a business idea. Or
something thoughtful to say. Writing

them down expedites the idea build- 4
ing process, but you need to add the
second habit to maximize the benefits.
The third habit: Share your
thoughts with others. Networks like
Silicon Valley are so conducive to
success because people constantly
share their ideas - they "get all the
spare parts on the table," as Johnson
states in his book. The collective can
add invaluable feedback: "Try doing
this. Have you thought of that?" Or
my personal favorite: "That's already
been done - 10 years ago."
A recent piece in the New Yorker
about innovation and creativity,
written by Malcolm Gladwell, shows
these three habits in action:
"A genius is a genius...because he
can put together such a staggering
number of insights, ideas, theories,
random observations and unexpect-
ed connections that he almost inevi-
tably ends up with something great.
Quality is a probabilistic function of
quantity."

Like any skill,
ingenuity can be
practiced.

According to a June 9 Detroit
Free Press article, the four bills
propose revising the process
for removing tenured teachers
from the classroom. Proponents
of these measures argue that
changing the current tenure sys-
tem will not only save time and
money, but also encourage more
rigid evaluation of educators -
an essential move for improv-
ing education in the state. Under
the new legislation, all teachers
- regardless of tenured status -
will now be regularly evaluated
as either "effective" or "ineffec-
tive." This is a vital step in terms
of education reform -Four cur-
rent education system is anti-
quated, placing more emphasis
on seniority rather than quality.
By taking steps to level the play-
ing field, the proposed legisla-
tion encourages establishing a
more competitive environment
for teachers, ensuring that teach-
ers will be placed in classrooms
based on merit and skill rather
than seniority. It's clear that the

state needs to up the ante when
it comes to education, and this
set of bills promotes a high level
of quality and accountability in
teachers.that cannot exist under
more lenient tenure systems.
Though the bill certainly takes
positive steps forward in improv-
ing Michigan's education system,
the vague language of the legisla-
tion hinders its potential success.
The bills' creators emphasized
the importance on assessments
of teacher quality, but the leg-
islation lacks comprehensive
instructions on how to quantify
or qualify the effectiveness of
teachers. Without some kind of
system to evaluate educators,
the legislation may flounder in
practice. The bills also disallow
collective bargaining for issues
such as performance evaluation
systems and the placement of
teachers. Considering the gener-
alized nature of the bills, espe-
cially when it comes to its quality
assessment systems, it's illogical
to throw out unions' rights to

provide input on the new evalua-
tion procedures.
While the bills create a rough
outline for eliminating inef-
fective teachers - a crucial
step in comprehensive educa-
tion reform - the legislation
ignores the need to incentivize
the profession. A good educa-
tion bill must not only draft a
fair system for the dismissal
of substandard educators, but
also attract new profession-
als of the quality it purports
to be in favor of. Despite the
irrefutable need to drastically
improve the education system
in Michigan, teaching remains
an underappreciated profession
both economically and socially.
When drafting bills that aim to
improve education, state legis-
lators will end up doing more
harm than good by making
teaching a less desirable pro-
fession. The state Senate must
vote down these measures until
the bills include reforms that
increase the appeal of teaching.

The first habit: Write everything
down. Check. The second habit:
Review insights, theories and ran-
dom observations. Check. And the
third habit?
The New Yorker piece goes on to
chronicle how Steve Jobs stole the
idea of a personal computer from
Xerox. The story displays Xerox as
the big loser, but in reality, Xerox was
a huge success. Xerox created a user
unfriendly, unmarketable PC, and
if they hadn't shared their creation
with Jobs, there wouldn't have been
a huge market for Xerox's flagship
product: the printer. It took losing the
big one - the computer - to win the
small accomplishment of the printer,
which considering Xerox's success
today, isn't that small.
The third habit: Share your ideas.
Check.
Ken Robinson outlined what cre-
ativity is and why it's important.
But he didn't outline how it could be
taught - and more importantly, how
it can be learned. But don't take soy
word for it. Experiment with these
habits, develop some of your own and
see what works for you. That's some-
thing to mull over in a notebook.

Eliminate labels

JEFF ZUSCHLAG

E-MAIL JEFFAT JEFFDZ (tUMICH.EDU

Of all the popular cliches in
American politics, bipartisanship
has to take the gold medal for the
difference in its
use in speeches
and its actual
practice in Con-
gress. The truth
is, as much as
politicians hail
bipartisanship
and compromise MAX
as a political LEVENSTEIN
goal, their terms
in office usually
center around the battle between
conflicting ideologies. Universal
health care, environmental and eco-
nomic policy are all examples of
issues that were once promised to
be solved by working with others
"across the aisle," yet have devolved
into the typical fight between liber-
als and conservatives.
We live with this reality, and for
better or worse, must accept the fact
that this country will always have
large diametrically opposed popu-
lations of liberals and conservatives.
But what do these terms - liberal
and conservative - actually mean?
Never mind the fact that the
word "liberal" is derived from liber-
tarianism, a branch of political phi-
losophy that emphasizes personal
responsibility, individual rights and
small government (now a "conser-
vative" ideal), or that conservatives
traditionally have supported a large
and strongly structured govern-
ment in order to maintainthe status
quo. But what do these words mean
now? My impression is that popular
politics refer to conservatives as
those who like small government,
and liberals as those who like it big.
Conservatives like low taxes, liber-
als and liberals who like them high.
Conservatives are pro-life, liberals
are pro-choice.
I can accept the fundamental
differences between these political
ideologies, as many of these issues
are complex and have strong and
legitimate supporting arguments
for both sides. I do, however, have a
problem with many of the hypocri-
sies that arise out of these political
labels. If Republicans are pro-life,
that's fine. But how can one believe
that every life is sacred and endorse
capital punishment? Republicans
want small government that leaves
individuals alone, but push federal
legislation opposing gay marriage.
Of course, the opposite argument
can be made against Democrats.
They want to secure personal lib-
erty by legalizing the use of mari-
juana, but wish to ban smoking on

the University campus, city streets
and privately owned restaurants.
This list goes on and on, each
one of the hypocrisies making me
laugh just a little. How and why
do individuals support and oppose
such similar issues? Obviously the
examples I listed are not black and
white as they fall into different
spheres of politics and economics,
but there are still inconsistencies.
It seems problematic to call your-
self a conservative but decide the
things you don't want people to have
individual responsibility for, such
as drug use and military service.
What I find even more problematic
is an individual who doesn't pick
Bipartisan is
simply a banal
buzzword.
and choose what they feel is the best
choice in their judgment and instead
directs every decision by what their
strict political ideology tells them to
think. There is value in having indi-
viduals think for themselves, who
make informed and justifiable deci-
sions that have nothing to do with
political philosophy or tradition.
Individual thinking ought to be
applied more often in politics, elimi-
nating the need for labels. The afor-
mentioned hypocrisies only exist
when individuals and politicians
cling to these ideologies and label
themselves as such.
Many Congressional politicians
fall victim to the labels of Republi-
can or Democrat. Their decisions
are often based on party lines, turn-
ing individual thought into herd
behavior. Political party whips are
specifically employed to ensure that
no one in their party will think and
vote differently. Is this the biparti-
sanship that our leaders in Washing-
ton promised us?
The only way to effectively
trudge through our extensive list
of political problems is too aban-
don our way of labeling people and
politicians, and instead focus on
individual arguments that are not
biased by what color their state is.
This may be difficult, as party orga-
nization is powerful and stable, but
as voters we can and should pick
and choose politicians who act gen-
uinely and individually.

I nurtured my last sip of beer
at Ashley's and stood to leave. It
was one of those randomly warm
days that got -
mixed in with
the myriad
of cold ones.
State Street
was bustling
with people
wearing dusty, -
rediscovered BLAKE
summer attire, OBI
pulled from _
the shadow-
veiled corners of their closets.
I stood waiting for the cross-
walk to change and overheard
a friendly debate between two
bums: "If you had to choose -
which is more important, the
cheese or the wrapper of a Kraft
American Single?"
Growing up in a typical Ameri-
can household, I'm very familiar
with the Kraft American Single
and its wrapper. The iconic small
flap at the top that is to be peeled
away first, then the rest of the
wrapper that hugs the greater
part of the cheese. It's the perfect
element for a grilled cheese sand-
wich, to melt over eggs or simply
eat plain. As I pretended to be
busy reading old text messages on
my phone, I eavesdropped on their
conversation, straining to hear
both arguments past the noise in
the street. The first bum stood tall
and had a Christ-like appearance,
and argued that the wrapper is the
more important part of the single
- it's the unsung hero that keeps
the cheese fresh. The second bum
was shorter in stature, but the
tone of his voice was strong and
authoritative, retorting that the
cheese is the substance, the part
you're paying for and eating, and
thus obviously more important.

As I walked away, I contem-
plated both arguments. I came
to the conclusion that the cheese
is obviously the more impor-
tant part; it's the sustenance
and the product, so it definitely
reigns supreme. But the wrap-
per intrigued me. I thought long
and hard about the wrapper as
I walked. Why is it there? How
many must Kraft produce a year?
That's a lot of plastic. I had an
overwhelming feeling that the
wrapper is not "underappreci-
ated" like the Jesus-bum claimed
- it's simply unnecessary.
That's a lot of plastic for one
slice of cheese. This wasteful-
ness aroused my curiosity and
so I braved the UGLi to do some
research. Kraft sells $400 mil-
lion of American Singles alone
each year. A 16-pack of the
individually packaged cheese is
about $3.50. That means Kraft
sells about 115 million packs of
singles a year. With 16 slices in
each pack, that's about 1.8 bil-
lion slices of cheese - each one
hugged tightly by a piece of plas-
tic. I contacted Kraft to find out
more about their packaging of the
single, but their transparency did
not mimic their wrapper. I was
told by Kim McMiller, associate
director of consumer relations,
that "the individual packaging
is provided by a supplier who
wishes to be kept anonymous,
therefore, we are not able to pro-
vide you with any information."
The point is that there is a lot of
unnecessary waste going on here
that should be remedied, and it
seems to me that Kraft knows it,
based on their unwillingness to
provide any numbers or informa-
tion about their product.
Get rid of the damn wrapper.
Stack the slices on top of each

other and put them in a reseal-
able container - the cheese will
stay fresh and maybe the con-
tainer can be reused as recy-
clable Tupperware. The point
is we don't think of something
so small as waste. We all mind-
lessly throw away wrapper after
wrapper, not thinking about how
each one contributes to the bil-
lions we throw away every year.
This doesn't stop with cheese.
We practice wasteful methods
everywhere without a thought.
We allow powerful corporations
like Kraft do what they want
We mindlessly
waste without a
second thought.
because we are complacent, act-
ing as if we see no problem with
the way things are run. But I see
a problem - and this may be only
one instance of waste among
the many out there, but it is an
instance of waste, and it shouldbe
fixed. If this fake cheese has won
you over like it has me, let's not
allow this love affair to blind us
on issue of wastefulness. We have
given them power by standing by
and doing nothing, continuing to
mindlessly buy their product. I'm
going to send an e-mail to com-
pany to display my disgust and
I'm going to stop eating Kraft
singles until they change. Maybe
if everyone else does the same,
Kraft will hear.

COURTESY OF PARAMOUNT
Disheveled appearances, far-off expressions ... is this an alternative "Lost" poster, J.J.?
'Super 8' brings out best
in actors and producers

Abrams and Spielberg
join forces with
retro-chic alien
thriller
By TIMOTHY RABB
DailyArts Writer
if there's anything new to say
about this weekend's "Super 8,"
it's that it should be making big-
ger waves - way
bigger waves. It's *
the perfect mar-
riage of minds:S
Steven Spielberg,
the indomitable AtQuality 16
storyteller, and and Rave
J.J. Abrams, who
gives the story Paramount
just the right
amount of weirdness to distin-
guish it from Spielberg's myriad
epics.
The retro-chic thriller frames
the quiet town of Lillian, Oh. at the
center of a tense battle between
Lillian's townies, the Army, and a
mysterious, other-worldly threat.
It's easy to be skeptical at first,
what with the ambiguous teaser

and rumors that it would be a
companion to "Cloverfield." But
"Super 8" lived up to the hype,
exceeded it even.
Though he's not in the direc-
tor's chair, many thanks are owed
to Spielberg, whose fingerprints
are all over this picture. He has an
eye for plot elements and charac-
ters with universal appeal, and he
succeeds in numerous ways here.
The acting, for one, is the best
in the recent history of sci-fi
film, and a huge step up from the
douchey caricatures that popu-
lated "Cloverfield." Abrams -
brilliant as his films' narrative
concepts and visuals are - doesn't
always get the best performances
from his talent.
That's where Spielberg comes
in. Though his usual stable of
bankable actors is nowhere to
be seen in "Super 8," he gets the
same (if not better) quality from a
bevy of fresh faces, which include
the pouty-lipped Elle Fanning
("Somewhere"), first-timer Joel
Courtney and several other prom-
ising child actors.
The young cast's natural chem-
istry and the retro, homely setting
give us a healthy twinge of block-
buster nostalgia without gushing

sentimental. No wonder the kids
have already invited comparisons
to the lovable youngsters of Goon
Docks fame.
Better still, not a moment of
screen time goes to waste as each
scene addresses key plot elements
with perfect pacing and equal
helpings of conflict, romance,
suspense and good old-fashioned
violence.
Creatively,
a perfect
marriage of
minds.
Spielberg doesn't take the
whole cake, though. Evidence
of Abrams's work can be seen in
some quirky, yet fitting, camera
angles, and (most importantly)
the awe-inducing action scenes -
these include an explosive train
derailment and a spaceship made
of magnetized trash, both over-
the-top in a good way.

As much as it hurts to criticize
such a holistic effort, there are
two things keeping"Super 8" from
the timelessness of a traditional
Spielberg film. You'll notice the
first flaw in particularly intense
scenes, when dialogue among
the children sounds awkwardly
lighthearted. Call it conservative,
but it seems disingenuous when
a bunch of kids are joking about
their friend's weight problem
while townspeople are killed all
around them.
But these moments are few,
far between and of lesser con-
cern than the underwhelming,
overly-politically correct ending,
which manages to omit about half
a dozen unresolved plot threads.
Beautiful as the film's final image
is, it's not much of a consolation.
But most of it is still packed with
enough meatto be worth your $10.
"Super 8" commits to a climax
of nuclear proportions, throw-
ing lovable characters, stylish
cinematography and chaotic spe-
cial effects into a mixing pot of
unbearable tension. And once
it's all on the cusp of a feverish
boiling point ... someone turns it
back down to "simmer." A damn
shame.

COURTESY OF DOMINO

An album so perfect for afternoon drives that they're listening to it in their own car.

Arctic Monkeys album
breeds a sinister charm

'Suck It and See'
swaps tongue-
twisting melodies
for mellow sound
By PROMA KHOSLA
Senior Arts Editor
This may come as a shock, but
most musicians don't enjoy the
luxury of albums that debut at
number one. But the Arctic Mon-
keys have
experienced ****
that joy with
four out of Arctic
four efforts. Monkeys
Their most
recent full- Suck It
length album, And See
Suck It and
See, shot to Domino
the top of the
U.K. charts this month, as the
band continues its tour of the
globe to insatiable crowds in
packed theaters. And by the way,
they're only 25 years old.
It seems that the fabulous
foursome from Northern Eng-
land can do no wrong. James
Ford, who produced all of Favou-
rite Worst Nightmare (2007)
and select tracks on the slightly
underwhelming Humbug (2009),
returns in full for the fourth
album. Suck It and See isn't quite

where the first two albums are,
but it hints at the unique sound
the boys brought to the indie
rock scene in 2006 and inte-
grates it into their repertoire for
the new decade.
Opening track "She's Thun-
derstorms" starts with charac-
teristically creepy guitar chords,
but in under 20 seconds, takes a
surprising turn toward the world
of love songs. The lyrics depict
both frustration and awe. Turn-
er describes a girl as turbulent
and untamable as the weather
- she's not just a thunderstorm.
She's the freaking plural.
The tone has been set both
lyrically and melodically for
the rest of the album. "Black
Treacle," "The Hellcat Spangled
Shalala," "Reckless Serenade,"
"Piledriver Waltz," "Love Is a
Laserquest" and title track "Suck
It and See" all fall categorically
into the same type of romantic
and relaxed rock song.
The above songs run the risk
of sounding the same, just like
the track list of Humbug, but
after a few listens, the songs
develop their individual charm.
"Brick By Brick" and "Library
Pictures" are the most reminis-
cent of the Monkeys' first album.
Nonsense lyrics return in the
latter and also in the playfully
titled "Don't Sit Down Cause
I've Moved Your Chair," which
includes such gems as "Do the

Macarena in the devil's lair."
The melody is unusually sinister,
but the ease with which Turner
eerily croons it makes you won-
der how you didn't see it coming.
Gone are the diabolically
British tongue-twisters of the
first three albums. Gone is the
garage-band feel and the uncer-
tainty of what genre you're lis-
tening to. Suck It and See is more
indie than punk rock. It refines
the musical the evolution hinted
at in Humbug. Though it may not
be Arctic Monkeys as you know
them, it's a shamelessly appro-
priate album for summer after-
noon drives.
The band's
naysayers can
just 'Suck It
and See.'
With unprecedented success
and no dearth of creativity, the
Arctic Monkeys have made clear
that they're here to stay. Suck
It and See may not be their best
album, but it is by no means their
last. They live to practice and
perfect their craft, and we're just
lucky enough to listen.

Summer Festival
returns with an
interactive new season
By ANNA SADOVSKAYA
For theDaily
As summer nears its peak, Ann
Arbor Summer Festival lights up
Ingalls Mall for its 28th annual
celebration. As
usual, the FestivalA
is broken into out- Aim Arbor
door and indoor Summer
events, respec- Festival
tively known as
Top of the Park June17-
and Mainstage. July 10
"Top of the
Park is the heart
and soul of the Summer Festival,"
said Robb Woulfe, executive direc-
tor and all-around enthusiast of
Ann Arbor Summer Festival. "It's
more social and allows for people
to throw their blankets on the lawn
and relax with family and friends,
solidifying our event."
Top of the Park offers free admis-
sion to 62 musical acts, 13 feature
films and 8 guest DJs, and will also
be host to performances such as the
acrobatic dances of Strange Fruit
and attractions like Architects of
Airs' "Amococo."
"This year we're bringing back
one of our most popular attrac-
tions, called Strange Fruit," Woulfe
said. "A lot of people know it as 'the
pole people,' because it features
performers on 15-foot poles doing
remarkable things."
Strange Fruit, originatingin Mel-
bourne, Australia, fuses acrobat-
ics and dance to deliver a striking
and innovative presentation. For
the Ann Arbor Summer Festival,
Strange Fruit is bringing its show
"The Three Belles," which show-
cases a trio of women circling and
swinging to music while balancing
precariously.
"Our other really big attraction
is 'Amococo' by Architects of Air,
and that's a 10,000-foot inflatable
vinyl structure landing at Palmer
Field," Woulfe added.
The luminarium, or sculpture of
light and color, will be interactive
- allowing visitors to explore its
10,000 square foot expanse.

Along with Top of the Park's
outdoor events, Ann Arbor Sum-
mer Festival's Mainstage features
indoor concerts and performances
by visiting artists.
"Our indoor season is amaz-
ing. So many people love Top of
the Park that they don't even know
that someone like K. D. Lang is
right next door, at the Mainstage,"
Woulfe said.
"We have a circus troop this year
called Tom Tom Crew, and they are
phenomenal. It's a hip-hop crew
that meets circus artistry and it's
very exciting," he explained. "This
is onlytheir second time inAmerica
- the last time they were here they
were in a sold-out show on Broad-
way."
The Mainstage events also
include performances by Steve
Martin, Los Lonely Boys and 0
Andrew Bird, among others.
"We're really thrilled to present
this group of artists on our stage
this year," Woulfe added.

62 musical acts,
13 films, 8 DJs.

0

In order to sort through the high
number of events, the Summer Fes-
tival website, annarborsummer-
festival.org, has added a calendar
feature where users can select the
movies and bands they wantto see.
"We're also encouraging folks to
share their experiences, and send
us emails and photos and videos,
so we can put all that up on the
website throughout the festival,"
Woulfe said. "It's probably the best
resource to get the most from your
festival experience."
Whether you wish to explore the *
hip sounds of Monsieur Guillaume
& His Zydeco Hepcats, folk out to
Hannah Winkler or swing to the
tunes of Delilah DeWylde and The
Lost Boys, there's something for
everyone at Top of the Park.
"There's something really 0
romantic about being on the lawn,
hanging out with friends and
watching a classic movie or fun
band," Woulfe said. "The whole sea-
son is filled with great nights, with a
little bit of everything."

'M'unveils'legacy'uniforms for Notre Dame game

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
They're not throwbacks, retros,
or alternates.
They're legacy uniforms.
Friday night, three months to
the hour before the Michigan foot-
ball team will play against Notre
Dame in Michigan Stadium's first
night game, Michigan Athletic
Director Dave Brandon unveiled
Michigan's uniforms for thegame.
The uniforms are blue with a
block 'M' on the front, in an old-
school stitched pattern. Jersey
numbers are on both sides of the
gray face-masked helmet as well
as on the left shoulder, where a
captain's 'C' would be in hock-
ey. Alternating Maize and Blue
stripes are on top of the shoulder
pads.
"The uniform is really an
aggregation of multiple elements
of our football uniforms, going
past decades," Brandon said. "We
really should think of it as a legacy
uniform. If you were in Schem-
bechler Hall and you walked by
the wall that has team pictures
going back all the way to the late
1800s, you will see that there are
subseantial chan es and a lot of

different looks that these uni-
forms took on over time.
"And what we really wanted to
do as part of this special event is to
grab key elements from those dif-
ferent team uniforms and incor-
porate them into something that
our players wear and have a lot of
fun and get excited about in this
big game against Notre Dame."
The announcement was made
inside a suite at Michigan Sta-
dium.
With many of the current foot-
ball players on hand, junior quar-
terback Denard Robinson and.
redshirt senior defensive end Ryan
Van Bergen modeled the uniforms
for the assembled crowd.
Robinson echoed many of the
sentiments the players had already
expressed about the uniforms.
"These uniforms are amazing,"
Robinson said. "I love them."
These uniforms have been a
year in the making. And they'll
only be worn once. The jerseys
will be auctioned off for charity
after the game.
According to Adidas Director of
Sports Marketing Chris McGuire,
the company went through
approximately eight different ren-
ditions and also worked with the

athletic department to make sure
they were legal for game play.
With the block 'M' on the front
of the jersey being the biggest
feature, the numbers on the front
were the biggest problems. NCAA
rules require teams to have num-
bers on both sides on their jerseys
and that they be at least an inch-
and-a-half wide.
"We worked with the officials,
and with the conferences and we
worked with Notre Dame to cap-
ture that element in a way that we
don't think will affect the compe-
tition but really gives us a chance
to fully develop the theme," Bran-
don said.
The uniforms had some com-
petition for breakout star in the
event. The 6-foot-6, 283-pound
Van Bergen impressed people with
his modeling abilities, particularly
fellow defensive end junior Craig
Roh.
"I loved it right away," Roh said
of the jerseys. "It's innovative, it
speaks to the tradition that Michi-
gan has and Ryan Van Bergen just
looks great in it."
Added Van Bergen: "I would
consider myself an amateur mod-
eler ... I'm ready for America's
Next Top (Model)."

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com
Wiseman returns to Michigan as assistant coach

4

Two decades later,
program's all-time
great scorer is back
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Nearly 20 years ago, Brian
Wiseman headlined the Michigan
hockey team led by the watchful
eyes of head coach Red Berenson
and his untested battery of assis-
tants, Mel Pearson and Billy Pow-
ers.
When Wiseman came to Ann
Arbor, Michigan's hockey pro-
gram was just starting to find its
feet. And his freshman campaign
began an unprecedented streak -
the Wolverines have not missed
a single NCAA Tournament bid
since 1991.
And the unproven cast of
coaches became perhaps the most
renowned trio in college hockey.
Now, Wiseman is one of them.
After Pearson left Ann Arbor in
May to become the head coach of
his alma mater Michigan Tech,
Berenson began a coaching search
that ended with the hiring of
Wiseman this past Thursday.
Wiseman was a four-year let-
terwinner, captain, All-American
and Hobey Baker finalist under
Berenson at Michigan during his
career from 1991-94. The Wolver-

ines reached the Frozen Four in
1992 and 1993.
"When this opportunity came
up, he was the first name that
came to my mind," Berenson told
the Athletic Department. "Now,
we ended up with some great can-
didates, but Wiseman was our
choice.
"He was one of the first play-
ers we had play at Michigan that
wanted to come back before he
left. He just loved it here."
Wiseman tallied 248 points as
a Wolverine - good for third all-
time for the program - and his
164 assists rank him second in
Michigan history.
And he always wanted to return
to Ann Arbor.
After a significant minor-
league career and a three-game
stint with the Toronto Maple
Leafs, Wiseman reconnected with
the Michigan hockey program as
an administrative assistant from
2000-02.
"I have a strong passion for
Michigan and the Michigan hock-
ey program, so when I went there
as a student-athlete, it was always
a place - even at that time - that
I wanted to get back to in some
capacity," Wiseman said Thurs-
day. "It started then. Once the
position opened up a few weeks
ago ... I let (Berenson and Powers)
know that I was definitely inter-
ested."

Wiseman stepped behind the
bench to serve as an assistant
coach for Princeton during the
2003-04 season. He took a five-
year hiatus from hockey, working
as an account manager for M-I
SWACO, a Houston-based oil and
gas supplier.
But Wiseman had his eye on
returning to the college game -
and Michigan - all along.
He returned to guide the Hous-
ton Aeros, an American Hockey
League team he played with in
the minors, as an assistant coach,
leading the Aeros to the Calder
Cup finals this season.
The Aeros dropped a 2-1 series
lead and were finished off by the
Binghamton Senators on Monday.
Wiseman called his final game in
Houston "bittersweet."
"I felt bad for the staff here and
especially the players for all the
hard work they put in this year,"
Wiseman said. "But at the same
time, I'm thrilled and excited to
get to Ann Arbor and get to work
recruiting - getting out and find-
ing the next wave of players to
come through Ann Arbor.
"I can't wait."
Pearson - essentially a flight-
less bird due to a phobia of flying -
was a key and successful recruiter
in Michigan and Ontario, and
Wiseman will be expected to
maintain Michigan's long-stand-
ing reputation of bringing in top

Stonum given two-years' probation for second.DUI

Senior receiver also
charged with driving
with suspended license
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
In his Friday morning sentenc-
ing at the 15th District Court in
Ann Arbor, wide receiver Dar-
ryl Stonum was sentenced to two
years' probation for a second
offense of operating a vehicle
while intoxicated.
Stonum, a senior on the Michi-
gan football team, was initially
arrested just after 2 a.m. on May 6
by University of Michigan police
after being pulled over near the
intersection of State Street and
William Street.

Two breath tests at the police
station showed Stonum's blood-
alcohol level at .11 and .13 - both
well above the .08 legal limit in
Michigan. ,
At the time, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke decided to spend Sto-
num indefinitely from the team.
Hoke has set no timeline for Sto-
num's return.
The Stafford, Texas native
pleaded guilty to the charge of
drunken driving last week and
will face a 365-day suspended jail
sentence following the two years'
probation.
Suspended sentences are often
dropped if the defendant does not
violate his probation.
Stonum will remain in Judge
Julie Creal's sobriety court pro-
gram for his two years of proba-
tion.

In addition to two years of pro-

recent legal trouble in Ann Arbor.
Stonum must attend a MADD
victims panel, attend a substance-
abuse assessment this week, take
daily breathalyzer tests and have
drug screens.
Creal also suggested that Sto-

MEN'S LACROSSE
Paul prepares for rigors
of varsity-level lacrosse

By DAVID CASSLEMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan men's lacrosse coach
John Paul graduated from Ann
Arbor Pioneer High School in 1984
without having played a single orga-
nized game of lacrosse.
A quarter century later, with
several MCLA championships in
his swollen trophy case, Paul leads
the newly announced varsity men's
lacrosse team into the competi-
tive and bureaucratic challenges of
NCAA lacrosse.
In the beginning, playing catch
with friends at Burns Park in Ann
Arbor, some bystanders mistook
Paul's lacrosse stick for a Jai alai bas-
ket. Others wondered ifhe was going
fishing with his peculiar-looking
net.
"I knew I wanted to play in high
school, but at the time there were
maybe 13 high school teams in the
state," Paul said. "Pioneer didn't
have a program yet, but there were a
number of us trying to get a program
going. I had a stick in high school,
and I had buddies who had grown
up around lacrosse."
In the past 25 years lacrosse has
exploded in popularity, rising from
an East Coast-dominated sport to a
national and even international phe-
nomenon.
Paul attributes the growth of
lacrosse to cultural considerations.
"The 90s brought on this oppor-
tunity for new sports, even though
ours is a very old sport," Paul said.
"All these sports that weren't con-
sidered sports now became main-
stream. It provided a cultural
opportunity for new sports."
And no one's mistaking lacrosse
for Jai alai anymore.
In the mid-1980s, Paul trans-
ferred from Albion College to Michi-
gan, where his father was a professor
and deanofthe College ofPharmacy,
and began playing club lacrosse.
"When I played it was very much
a club team," Paul said. "You showed
up when you wanted to show up.
We'd hop into each other's cars to
get to games.
"It was pretty good lacrosse but
it was nothing like it became as an
MCLA team."
Paul's coaching career began
shortly after his playing career,
when he started helping out at his
alma mater, Ann Arbor Pioneer.
After receiving his undergraduate

degree in 1992, Paul took a position
in the development office in the Ath-
letic Department, while assisting
with the Michigan club team. Paul
became head coach in 1998.
In 14 seasons Paul's overall record
is 223-43, with 11 CCLA conference
championships and three MCLA
national championships. And Paul
helped create an environment where
the club varsity team flourished, by
attracting donors, building infra-
structure and attracting talented
athletes.
The success of Michigan lacrosse,
along with a host of other factors,
contributed to the team's promotion
to the varsity level.
Another significant factor was a
change in leadership in Michigan's
Athletic Department.
Athletic Director Dave Brandon
arrived in Weidenbach Hall with a
strong plan concerning the future of
Michigan athletics. Part of that plan
was the elevation of men and wom-
en's lacrosse, which Paul learned
about as soon as Brandon took over.
Former Athletic Director Bill
Martin, while generally supportive
of the lacrosse team, did not make
the team's promotion a priority.
"He was very supportive of our
program in every way except mak-
ing it varsity," Paul said. "It's not
something I ever approached him
about in any serious way because I
knew it wasn't on his agenda."
Now in the world of the NCAA,
Paul faces a demanding landscape
of compliance issues, scholarships
and the other frustrating realities of
big-time college athletics. Of course
there is also the essential challenge
of playing better teams.
"We go from a program that's 76-2
over the last four years to a program
that realistically is going to struggle
for a few years as we build our talent
base up to an elite level," Paul said.
"That's going to take some time."
With new obligations come new
privileges. As a club team Michigan
lacrosse had to do everything by
themselves - from hiring and sup-
porting a training staff to providing
IT support. Now they have the full
support of the Michigan community.
For the players, the change will
begin to be understood when they
come back to Ann Arbor in the fall.
"Theyare excitedbutI'm not sure
that they full realize yet what this is
going to mean," Paul said. "This is a
dream for a lot of them."
