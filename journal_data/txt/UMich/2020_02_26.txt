Hundreds of supporters filled 
the conference room of the 
Detroit Marriott in Troy, Mich. 
on Tuesday wearing bright red 
“Make America Great Again” 
hats and chanting “four more 
years.” The crowd was there to 
hear from Vice President Mike 
Pence and rally in support of 
President Donald Trump’s 2020 
re-election campaign. 
Pence’s stop in Troy was the 

final leg of his day-long bus tour 
of Michigan. Pence spoke in 
Lansing at the Michigan Farm 
Bureau’s 
legislative 
seminar 
earlier in the day. 
Though 
Trump 
won 
Michigan in 2016 by 10,704 
votes 
over 
Democratic 
Presidential Candidate Hillary 
Clinton, Trump lost in Troy by 
314 votes. However, Trump did 
win Macomb County, which 
borders Troy and is considered 
a key battleground county in 
the state.

The 
event 
opened 
with 
remarks 
from 
Laura 
Cox, 
Michigan 
Republican 
Party 
chairwoman, who spoke about 
her support for Trump and 
Pence.
“President 
Trump 
and 
Vice President Pence made a 
promise to fight for Michigan,” 
Cox said to the crowd. “And 
I know no matter what, and 
everyone here in this room will 
vote to re-elect the President. 
Promises made and promises 
kept.” 

Cox then turned the mic over 
to Sonny Perdue, U.S. Secretary 
of Agriculture, to introduce 
and promote Pence.
“President Trump, as great 
as we know, he’s had a great 
wingman beside him all the 
way,” Perdue said. “I can 
tell you, I’ve never heard an 
administration 
that 
loves 
America and puts America 
first more than the Trump-
Pence administration.”

More than 50 community 
members, 
including 
pro-
Palestinian activists, gathered 
in the Wolverine Room of the 
Union Tuesday night to discuss 
the impact of anti-Palestinian 
comments that Ben Gerstein, 
Central 
Student 
Government 
President and Public Policy junior, 
made as a senior in high school.
Four members from Students 

for Allied Freedom and Equality 
addressed the Assembly about 
their experiences as Palestinian 
students on campus, and their 
subsequent 
conversation 
with 
Gerstein about his comments. LSA 
sophomore Jinan Abufarha said 
she felt hopeless and afraid when 
she heard Gerstein’s comments 
and called for the Assembly 
to 
recognize 
anti-Palestinian 
discrimination as racism. 
“I don’t think a lot of people 
understand how disheartening it 
is as a Palestinian on this campus 

to see an elected representative to 
say that all I know how to do is to 
fund terrorism and reject peace 
deals,” Abufarha said. “Real 
damage has been done by this 
video and (the Assembly needs) 
to correct that.” 
LSA senior Reem Al-Khatib 
thanked Gerstein for apologizing. 
She called on the Assembly to 
pass a resolution introduced by 
SAFE 
condemning 
Gerstein’s 
comments and affirming the 
presence 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Palestinian 

community. 
“This is not my first time 
bearing my trauma in front of 
a face of strangers that I don’t 
know,” Al-Khatib said. “We want 
initiatives, we want change, and I 
know that Benjamin is willing to 
do that. He’s opened the line of 
communication, we have a trust 
forming, and we want the rest of 
the Assembly to be on board. We 
want the change we should have 
had two years ago.” 
LSA junior Kathleen Young is 
applying to medical schools this 
summer and said advisers are 
important to help address a “secret 
checklist” of requirements to be 
accepted into medical school. This 
checklist includes volunteering, 
research and shadowing doctors. 
Young sees a pre-health adviser 
once a month to answer her 
questions regarding the process. 
However, she said when she sees 
the adviser, it is rarely a one-on-
one appointment. Young said for 
one-on-one 
appointments, 
she 
has had to call months ahead to 
schedule them.
“For a scheduled appointment, 
I need to schedule it often three 
months 
in 
advance,” 
Young 
said. “When I see the advisers, I 
usually go into office hours. I very 
rarely have an actual one-on-one 
appointment with them.”
The 
Newnan 
Academic 
Advising Center holds pre-health 
advising office hours three times 
a week that are run on a drop-
in, group-based format, where 
students may ask a pre-health 
adviser their questions in front 
of the entire group. Young said 
she feels the office hours can be 
uncomfortable 
and 
stressful, 
especially when asking personal 
questions.

A 
Brighter 
Way, 
an 

organization 
helping 

previously 
incarcerated 
individuals transition back 
into society, held a discussion 
Tuesday 
in 
the 
Learning 
Resource 
Center 
at 
the 
Washtenaw County Sheriff’s 
Office. 
The event featured a panel 
of 
government 
legislators 
and previously incarcerated 
people, who discussed how 
citizens returning to society 
once 
they 
are 
released 
from prison. The event was 
attended by more than 100 
community members, many 
of whom were previously 
incarcerated themselves.
Cozine Welch, executive 
director of ABW, shared what 
prompted him to create the 
organization and event.
Welch said he served a 
19-year-and-nine-month 
sentence in Michigan prisons 
after being convicted at 17. He 
said having strong mentors 
when he was released from 
prison helped him realize 
he could make a change in 
other formerly incarcerated 
people’s lives.

Each month, The Michigan 
Daily 
sits 
down 
with 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
President Mark Schlissel to 
discuss 
important 
questions 
about 
University 
policy, 
commitments and challenges. 
Topics 
discussed 
in 
this 
month’s interview included the 
endowment, 
Provost 
Martin 
Philbert, 
sexual 
misconduct 
policy, GEO bargaining and 
health services at U-M Flint and 
Dearborn. 
This 
interview 
has 
been 
edited and condensed for clarity.
The Endowment
The Michigan Daily: At the 
Regents meeting on Thursday, 
after many student protests, 
the 
board 
announced 
they 
were freezing all fossil fuel 
investments while they study 
the current investment policy. 
Would you like to comment on 

this?
Mark Schlissel: Well, they 
didn’t 
announce 
they 
were 
freezing, they said they weren’t 
bringing forward new, direct 
investments in fossil fuels. And 
they just want some time and 
space to study the question of 
whether our investment policies 
are correct or not. So, I think 
there is a shoutout due to student 
advocacy. I think the board hears 
the advocacy and wants the time 
to discuss what the smart way 
is to move forward. … But, you 
know, the board is responsible 
for this almost $12 billion 
endowment, and it’s a very 
serious fiduciary responsibility, 
and we have to live up to our 
commitment to the donors that 
gave us the funds that became 
the endowment to consider the 
potential yield, and then how 
much risk we’re willing to accept 
as the main factors in deciding 
about investments. So, the board 
has to really look carefully at its 
responsibilities.

Ann 
Arbor 
residents 
gathered Tuesday night to 
discuss developing affordable 
housing at a meeting hosted 
by the city and SmithGroup, 
an 
architectural 
design 
firm. Held in the Downtown 
Development 
Ann 
Arbor 
Authority 
building, 
the 
meeting served as a follow-
up to a series of workshops 
held in December to garner 
community feedback about 
possible affordable housing 
sites. 
Attendees 
were 
handed 
a fact sheet that provided 
information about affordable 
housing in the city. In Ann 
Arbor, the area median income 
is $101,200. Families with 
incomes at 60 percent AMI or 
below qualify for affordable 
housing developed by the 
state, with affordable being 
defined as costing 30 percent 
or less of the household’s 
annual income. 
The 
lack 
of 
affordable 
housing in Ann Arbor has 
been a hot-button issue in 
recent years. In 2015, the 
city adopted a plan to create 
nearly 2,800 new affordable 
housing units by 2035, though 
less than 100 have been built 

since then.
Discussion at the meeting 
focused on redeveloping 350 
South 5th Ave., also known 
as the former Y-Lot, a site 
adjacent to the Ann Arbor 
District Library and Blake 
Transit Center. There was also 
a discussion of overhauling 
415 West Washington St., 
which is adjacent to the 
YMCA and the railroad track. 
Michael Johnson, an urban 
designer at SmithGroup, gave 
a presentation summarizing 
the results of surveys and 
feedback 
from 
community 
workshops 
regarding 
both 
sites. The results showed that 
respondents rated optimizing 
the number of affordable units 
for those with 60 percent AMI 
as the most important priority 
in redeveloping city-owned 
properties. 
Johnson 
summarized 
the 
community 
feedback 
into a set of assumptions in 
creating 
possible 
designs 
for new buildings in each lot 
and presented the preferred 
options to the audience. As 
he presented the possible 
designs, audience members 
shared criticisms. 
Johnson said the purpose 
of the meeting was to provide 
a space for the community 
to 
discuss 
and 
agree 
on 
requirements to set before the 
actual development process 

begins. 
“The hope is that based 
on what we’ve heard, we can 
begin a process that with the 
city’s assistance pre-entitles a 
series of criteria before even 
engaging a developer going 
through the next steps of that 
process,” Johnson said.
The proposed design for 
the former Y-Lot site included 
two 
buildings 
reaching 
a 
maximum of 200 feet and 
containing a total of 418 
units, 130 of which would 
be affordable housing. Some 
audience 
members 
shared 
concerns about the height of 
the building, while others felt 
it did not provide a sufficient 
number of affordable housing 
units.
The 415 W. Washington 
proposal, which contained 173 
total units with 15-20 percent 
affordable, raised additional 
concern from the community 
because of its location in a 
floodway 
and 
floodplain, 
which renders it ineligible to 
federal subsidies.
Some 
residents 
brought 
up concerns with parking 
and 
traffic 
congestion 
in 
the residential area. Others 
said they felt the location 
was unsafe for housing and 
advocated alternatives such as 
creating a park or community 
center. 
Ann Arbor resident Julia 

Goode expressed frustration 
with 
some 
community 
members’ 
unwillingness 
to 
consider 
the 
415 
W. 
Washington design proposal. 
“It felt like a ‘not in my 
backyard’ meeting,” Goode 
said. “People all started out in 
support of affordable housing, 
but as soon as it starts to 
get dense, then people get 
concerned about how big the 
building is, how tall — even 
though it’s not taller than 
the buildings around it — and 
that’s the only way you have 
affordable housing, is to build 
it denser, and that’s how you 
get cars off the street, by 
having a dense community so 
it becomes walkable.”
City 
Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, who was 
in 
attendance, 
encouraged 
attendees to be more open to 
the proposals brought forth 
by SmithGroup.
“I think the SmithGroup is 
listening to the community,” 
Ramlawi said. “I think we 
need to approach this with 
a little bit more optimism 
and go from there because 
we’re not really going to go 
anywhere if we think this is 
another exercise that goes 
nowhere.”

Feb. 25, 1998: Hundreds rally for affirmative action

Hundreds 
of 
students 
attempted to capture the essence 
of the ‘60s and ‘70s social 
movements as they demonstrated 
support for affirmative action at 
the University yesterday.
The National Day of Action, 
designated by the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson as a day to support 
affirmative action nationwide, 
was celebrated at the University 
by a rally and march on the 
Diag, two teach-ins and a sit-in 
at Angell Hall. Event organizers 
also encouraged students to skip 
classes for the day.
The day hit close to home 
at the University in light of 
two lawsuits filed against the 

University last fall that target 
its use of race in admissions 
policies. 
“It’s 
important 
for 
the 
students to show the media and 
the nation that it’s not business as 
usual when affirmative action is 
under attack,” said Law second-
year student Kevin Pimentel. 
After 
the 
morning 
teach-
in, Pimentel stood before 250 
students who gathered on the 
Diag to rally for affirmative 
action. 
Pimentel 
described 
affirmative 
action 
as 
“the 
last game of the Civil Rights 
Movement that is still standing.” 
Pimentel said that although his 
classes at the Law School were 

not cancelled, his professors 
accommodated 
students 
by 
offering audio and video tapes of 
missed lectures to students who 
participated in the day’s events.
“I think we have had a great 
showing of the school,” Pimentel 
said. “The people are really 
listening to the speakers here at 
the rally and at the teach-in.”
University officials said no 
classes were officially cancelled 
for the events. But several 
professors and graduate student 
instructors offered alternatives 
for students who missed classes 
yesterday.
History GSI Alice Ritscherle 
said she encouraged her class to 

attend the sit-in to learn more 
about how diversity affects the 
campus. 
“I am going to let students 
make up their own minds,” 
Ritscherle said. “I think it’s 
an unusual case where a lot of 
different interest groups have 
come together and listened to 
each other seri- ously.”
About 20 high school students 
from Ann Arbor Huron High 
School 
and 
Detroit’s 
Cass 
Technical High School, several 
of whom spoke at the rally, came 
to campus to take part in the 
day’s events. 
Alianza Co-chair Diana Derige 
said yesterday’s demonstration 

in support of affirmative action 
should not be limited to one day. 
“We need to think ahead and 
show our solidarity together,” 
said Derige, an LSA junior. “The 
plight of minority students on 
campus goes beyond affirmative 
action.”
After the rally, nearly 250 
students 
marched 
through 
campus, 
crammed 
into 
the 
Angell Hall Fishbowl area and 
staged a sit-in. Students sat 
on the floor for three hours to 
hear testimoni- als about how 
affirmative action, racism and 
diversity have impacted the 
campus.
Organizers said they were 

pleased with the number of 
students who took part in the 
day’s events. 
“I’m really impressed with the 
tumout. I think it’s obvious that a 
lot of people support affirmative 
action and are willing to miss a 
day of class” said Law first- year 
student Meera Deo, a member of 
United for Affinnative Action.
Engineering 
sophomore 
Robert 
Green 
said 
he 
was 
impressed with the diversity of 
the crowd that attended the sit-
in. 
“We need to take a stand as 
students,” Green said. “Awesome 
turnout, but there could be many 
more.”

RUCHITA IYER/Daily
Panelist speaks on the hidden plight of moderm farmers at Food Literacy for All, a weekly lecture series sponsored by the Sustainable Food Systems Initiative in Angell Hall 
Tuesday evening.

Pence opened his 30-minute 
speech 
by 
expressing 
his 
continued support for Trump 
and reminding the crowd that 
Michigan was a state Trump 
won back in 2016. 
“Here 
in 
Michigan, 
you 
believed 
we 
could 
be 
stronger,” 
Pence 
said. 
“You believed we could be 
prosperous again. You said 

‘yes’ to Donald Trump in 2016, 
and I know that Michigan is 
going to say ‘yes’ to four more 
years of President Trump.” 
Pence then talked about 
Trump’s immigration policies 
and 
the 
administration’s 
commitment 
to 
building 
a wall along the southern 
border. 
“Under 
the 
President’s 
leadership, we have made 
historic 
investments 
in 
border security and working 
on 
the 
crisis 
of 
illegal 

immigration on our border,” 
Pence said. “Once we secure 
our border, we’re going to 
pass immigration reform that 
puts America first.” 
According 
to 
the 
2018 
Enforcement 
and 
Removal 
report, ICE made 158,581 
administrative arrests in the 
2018 fiscal year, as opposed 
to the 143,470 arrests made in 
2017. 
Lastly, Pence talked about 
the Trump administration’s 
track record on promoting 

and creating manufacturing 
jobs. 
“Now, as I stand before you 
here today, I’ll tell you here 
in Michigan, the American 
economy is booming,” Pence 
said. 
“Since 
election 
day 
in 2016, almost 8 million 
jobs have been created by 
businesses, large and small, 
including 120,000 right here 
in the Great Lakes state.”

TMD: In late September, the 
Public Accountability Initiative 
released a report showing that 
$26 million of the University 
endowment was invested in 
private equity fund Lime Rock 
Partners as of October 2018. 
The fund finances oil driver Tim 
Dunn and Empower Texans, a 
conservative group that has a 
major role in supporting far-
right rhetoric and legislation, 
such as opposition to same-sex 
marriage, in Texas politics. 
In our interview last month, 
you told The Daily ideology 
does not play a large role in the 
endowment. Do you believe 
the University should work to 
incorporate the beliefs of the 
student body in its investments? 
MS: No. So, what I said last 
month is still the same. Imagine 
if we start making, as a filter for 
our investments, the perceived 
political beliefs of the people 
that own or manage the firm 
that’s doing the investing. Who 
gets to decide what political 
beliefs are allowed? And why 
should we make decisions about 
investment opportunities, not 
based on the risk and the reward 
of the investment, but based on 
our perception of whether we 
like the beliefs or not of the 
person who owns the business? 
I think that’s both inappropriate 
and very risky. You know, in 
a world where we value free 
speech and we value diversity, 
I think I can disagree with the 
owner of a business but still do 
business with the business. So, I 
don’t think those things should 
enter into investment decisions 
at all. … So, the student voice is 
important, but it doesn’t have a 
big input into the endowment. 
TMD: I guess I want to push 
you a little on that, because 
some of these organizations 
oppose same-sex marriage or 
gender-neutral 
bathrooms. 
Does the University not have 
an obligation to not invest in 
organizations that directly or 
indirectly might cause harm to 
others?
MS: 
My 
understanding 
is it’s not the organization 
that’s causing the harm, it’s an 
individual who is one of the 
owners of an organization who 
gets paid a profit because he’s 
running a business and that 
he decides or she decides what 
they want to do with that profit. 
Can you imagine how difficult 
it would be to make investment 
decisions at all if what we had 
to do was not just look carefully 
at the company we’re investing 
in and what they do but look at 
the people who benefit from 
those investments and what 
they do with the money they’re 
benefiting (from). I think that’d 
be almost an impossible task. 
TMD: Last interview, you 
said, and I quote, “We make a 
commitment to the donor to be 
a good steward of their money.” 
In the past, when the Regents 
have divested from apartheid 
South Africa and the tobacco 
industry, was there a financial 
indication that divestment from 
these industries was the best 
way to steward these donors’ 
money? Do you think they made 
the right call? 
MS: You know, it’s really 
tough to use hindsight to make 
these decisions. When it comes 
to the tobacco industry, it’s 
still a thriving, money-making 
business. So, it’s not clear that 
divestment affected the tobacco 
business, but way fewer people 
in your generation smoke than 
in my generation in college. 
So, I think there has been a 
movement away from cigarettes, 
which is a good thing. So, 
I think it’s complicated to 
assess 
whether 
divestment 
played a role in decreasing 
the popularity of smoking as 
compared to lots of research and 
then some good public interest 
campaigns 
and 
advertising. 
When it comes to apartheid, 
it’s also very hard. I think it’s 
unarguable that, in its day, 
apartheid was the most obvious 
and visible manifestation of 
evil in the world, affecting tens 
of millions of people. The fact 
that it was dismantled speaks to 
the consistency and bravery of 
many freedom fighters within 
South Africa, Mandela, the 
most famous of them. It speaks 
to a global pressure campaign 
that eventually influenced the 
government of that country. 
And I could imagine that the 

symbolism of people changing 
their 
investment 
patterns 
may also have influenced the 
eventual outcome. It’s hard 
to say what had the biggest 
responsibility for the very good 
change that occurred.
TMD: Do you think the 
symbolism 
of 
universities 
around the country divesting 
from fossil fuels could have the 
same impact?
MS: That’s a good question. 
I don’t know. Personally, I 
don’t think so. And the reason 
I don’t think so is, where I’d be 
spending my energy is working 
on demand for fossil fuels. So, 
what the divestment movement 
is working on is the supply of 
resources that that industry has 
to meet the demand. But, if the 
demand for fossil fuels goes up, 
there’ll always be entities that 
invest in fossil fuels, and the 
degradation of the environment 
will 
continue 
whether 
Michigan’s heavily invested in 
it or not. The symbolism I think 
is important to many people, 
and I see why. What I would be 
focusing on is putting pressure 
on our elected leaders to develop 
rules that hasten the transition 
to a low carbon economy. 
TMD: 
At 
the 
Regents 
meeting, a public commenter 
called on the University to make 
all endowment investments and 
records public. Is this something 
the University would consider?
MS: No. The reason why is 
we try to do research and hire 
smart people to help us invest 
our endowment to generate 
more money than the average 
investor. Over the last 20 years, 
we’ve averaged nearly 10 percent 
a year, and that’s with all the ups 
and downs of the economy over 
this very long period of time. It’s 
important to the University that 
we have a competitive advantage 
when it comes to our investment 
decisions. If we were to simply 
tell everyone what we’re going 
to do before we do it, we give up 
our competitive advantage.
Provost Martin Philbert 
and Robert Anderson
TMD: 
The 
Detroit 
Free 
Press 
recently 
released 
an 
article claiming the University 
administration 
knew 
about 
Provost 
Philbert’s 
alleged 
misconduct. One example was a 
lawsuit the University settled in 
2005 alleging Philbert engaged 
in 
inappropriate 
conduct 
with a female researcher in 
his toxicology lab. Another 
example 
is 
when 
former 
Provost Phil Hanson received 
multiple emails to investigate 
Philbert’s behavior. Do you have 
a response to these allegations?
MS: The things you mentioned 
are being investigated by the 
outside firm we’ve brought in 
to help us address allegations 
made against Provost Philbert. 
While those things are being 
investigated, I’m not going to 
talk about the details of the 
investigation, other than to say 
we have asked the investigators 
to address questions dating 
from the very beginning, so 
when the Provost worked for 
the University. … This case 
from the mid-2000s was when 
Provost Philbert was running 
a research lab, and it was an 
employment case brought by a 
male researcher that he let go. 
Nowhere in that lengthy lawsuit 
is sexual misconduct claimed 
against the Provost, and then 
during the adjudication case, 
there’s a discovery period where 
witnesses get deposed under 
oath, and nowhere was there a 
witness that said they observed 
sexual impropriety. 
TMD: 
Recent 
allegations 
against the late Dr. Anderson, 
former UHS Director and team 
physician, 
came 
out. 
What 
steps is the University taking to 
ensure that this pattern of sexual 
misconduct among high ranking 
University officials — and claims 
that the University was aware of 
them — stops now? Instead of 
providing support after the fact, 
how is the University working 
to proactively stop this before it 
happens?
MS: 
I 
think 
the 
most 
important thing in the short 
term is to understand as many 
facts as we can. We can look 
backwards and say, “What are 
the things that we might have 
done differently that would have 
prevented this inappropriate 
behavior from going on as long as 
it did?” That’s part of the goal of 
the investigation, to learn what 
those things are. But in general, 
we need to develop a culture, 
and every time I talk about 
this topic I say the same thing, 

where people feel comfortable 
coming forward when they 
either 
believe 
they’ve 
been 
mistreated, sexual misconduct 
or any other kind of misconduct 
or harassment or if they witness 
or hear about somebody else 
being treated mistreated. Then 
on our end, the promise is to 
take every one of these things 
seriously and investigate them 
thoroughly. … In the case of Dr. 
Anderson, who passed away 
more than a decade ago, it’s a 
little bit harder to investigate 
so far backwards. But our police 
did a very thorough job. The 
prosecutor, probably because 
Dr. Anderson had passed away, 
decided there weren’t criminal 
violations to be brought, but 
we’re continuing to investigate. 
We have a law firm helping us 
with that investigation. 
GEO Bargaining
TMD: During the public 
comment 
portion 
of 
the 
Regents meeting last Thursday, 
speakers 
claimed 
University 
Human Resources threatened 
not to negotiate over salary 
and benefits until the subjects 
of 
climate, 
housing 
and 
protections 
against 
sexual 
misconduct 
were 
dropped 
entirely from the coalition’s 
platform. If this is true, why is 
the University removing certain 
issues from the negotiating table 
completely? 
MS: I have read — although 
I’m 
not 
involved 
in 
the 
bargaining — that GEO wants 
to include issues about carbon 
neutrality and issues about 
things that don’t just affect 
them but affect everybody. And 
you can imagine it might be 
difficult to have a negotiation 
with one particular subset of 
our community, or an issue 
that affects everybody in the 
community that we’re dealing 
with separately.
TMD: Both GEO and the 
University have agreed to reach 
a tentative agreement by March 
1. What can you tell us about 
how this process is going so 
far and how the University is 
working to support its graduate 
student employees? 
MS: I know that the clock 
is ticking as we’re heading 
towards March, so I would share 
a sense of anxiousness that we 
actually make serious progress, 
so we don’t bump up against 
the 
deadline. 
The 
graduate 
students are the lifeblood of the 
University, and we’re the biggest 
public research university in the 
country, if not the world. Most 
of that research is done by our 
graduate students. They’re our 
partners in scholarship, they’re 
our successors very often in the 
academy; they’ll be tomorrow’s 
professors 
and 
leaders 
in 
society. So, we’re invested in 
their success.
Health Services at U-M 
Flint and Dearborn
TMD: The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
offers 
UHS 
care 
to all students at the Ann 
Arbor 
campus. 
While 
the 
median income on the Flint 
and 
Dearborn 
campuses 
is 
significantly lower than on the 
Ann Arbor campus, they have 
no access to campus health 
services. Why is this?
MS: Although you can walk 
in to the health service here, 
it’s not free — you’re paying 
for it. So, there’s a student fee 
charged in Ann Arbor that’s 
specifically dedicated to the 
health service that pays for 
their budget, so you are paying 
for the health service. Flint and 
Dearborn in the past have each 
had on-campus health services 
that turned out to be used very 
rarely, and we think the reason 
why is most of the students in 
Flint and Dearborn come from 
the communities that surround 
Flint and Dearborn; in other 
words, they’re very often still 
living at home or living with 
their families in a community 
where they’ve already been 
functioning as adults, so they 
have their own health care. … In 
Flint and Dearborn, however, in 
both cases, the University makes 
arrangements for students that 
don’t have health care to get 
convenient health care. … So, 
rather than maintain their own 
and charge students to maintain 
it when it’s rarely used, they 
have relationships with local 
health centers.

“Sometimes you don’t want to 
ask your personal questions in 
front of other people, especially 
when everyone else is trying 
to ask their questions in front 
of you, too,” Young said. “If I 
wanted to talk about my grades, 
I’d feel very self-conscious doing 
it in office hours rather than in 
one-on-one office hours.”
Young also said she worries 
about the number of questions 
the pre-health advisers need 
to answer in office hours while 
giving every student there an 
equal amount of their time. 
“At the office hours, I can 
tell that they are trying to get 
to everyone, so when I have 
multiple questions, I feel bad 
asking them when other people 
also have so many questions,” 
Young said. “So I have to ask 
one question, wait for others to 
ask theirs, and then ask another 
question and so on. I will hesitate 
and not ask a few, too, due to 
uncomfortability.”
David 
Brawn, 
associate 
director of the Newnan LSA 
Academic Advising Center, said 
two advisers have been added 
recently to help combat the 
extended wait times. Brawn 
advised students to also take 
advantage of other University 
programs 
for 
pre-health 
assistance.
“(We 
are) 
aware 
of 
the 
wait times for a pre-health 
appointment,” 
Brawn 
said. 
“We’ve been active in creating 
different ways for students to 
receive the guidance that they 
need. Additionally, students can 
take advantage of the University 
Career Center and the LSA 
Opportunity Hub, which also run 
excellent programs for students 
with pre-health interests.” 
LSA junior Hana Chung had a 
few quick questions and did not 
mind attending pre-health office 

hours last December. She said a 
more timid student may not feel 
as comfortable, however. Chung 
said she chose to go to office 
hours last November because she 
wasn’t able to find a one-on-one 
appointment until the next year. 
“It might have taken me more 
time, but it wasn’t necessarily 
a waste of time at all,” Chung 
said. “I’m usually not shy about 
asking questions or talking about 
personal things. I do think that 
it’d be stressful for someone who 
really isn’t comfortable being 
around other people and asking 
deeper, specific questions.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Natalie 
White said long wait times for 
the office hours can impact pre-
med students’ mental health. She 
waited a month and a half for her 
one-on-one pre-health advising 
appointment.
“It definitely impacts your 
mental health when you’re really 
stressed out about your pre-med 
track and you have a resource 
there to call but they say, ‘We can 
get you an appointment, just stay 
stressed out for another month 
and a half,’” White said. “If I was 
a freshman (at office hours) and 
I heard a junior say they were 
doing volunteering, research, 
had a great GPA and they were 
still stressed out, that would 
have made me really nervous for 
my future.”
White said she believes pre-
health office hours would be less 
daunting to students if they were 
tailored to students who meet 
certain criteria.
“For freshmen, it might be 
beneficial to section off the office 
hours for those who are literally 
just getting started,” White said. 
“And different office hours for 
people who are applying this 
round… And I think that will be 
super helpful and will make the 
situation less intimidating to go 
into since you know where other 
people will be when you get 
there.”
LSA 
junior 
Ria 
Mahesh 
was able to get a pre-health 

appointment within a week 
of calling the advising office 
as 
a 
sophomore. 
However, 
she said she was disappointed 
with the advice she was given 
at her appointment once the 
adviser noticed a few B’s on her 
transcript. 
“All she could tell me was I 
need to be better, otherwise I’m 
not going to get into med school,” 
Mahesh said. “She was just kind 
of like, this is the general path of 
what kids take and here’s what 
you’ve done so far. But her main 
point was you need to be better. 
I remember leaving not feeling 
very confident in my ability on 
being pre-med.”
Mahesh said she believes pre-
health advisers should remember 
that though they see a large 
number of students every day, 
they should try their best to offer 
support and encouragement. 
“I think when it comes to how 
they handle students that are 
struggling in a certain track or 
for guidance on how to exceed 
expectations in a certain track, 
they also need to understand 
there is someone there that 
needs support and not just needs 
to know what classes to take,” 
Mahesh said. “I feel if I had an 
adviser that had my back, I’d be 
much more confident in myself.”
Brawn also explained they 
have resources, such as general 
adviser 
meetings, 
readily 
available in the case of time-
sensitive matters. The Newnan 
LSA Academic Advising Center 
also has online resources that 
may answer some students’ 
questions.
“Advisers in the Newnan 
Center are trained to respond 
quickly to emergencies of all 
types and we regularly make 
sure that we either help students 
directly or put them in contact 
with the appropriate resources 
when addressing this kind of 
situation,” Brawn said.

Under 
the 
Trump 
administration, 
roughly 
6.7 
million jobs were created over 
the past 3 years. In Michigan, 
over the first 30 months of 
his presidency, 111,300 jobs 
were created. By comparison, 
Obama created 205,000 jobs in 
Michigan in his last 30 months 
of office.
Pence closed out his speech 
by encouraging the crowd to 
vote for Trump in 2020. 
“Between now and November 
we’re 
going 
to 
keep 
on 
marching,” Pence said. “We’re 
going to make Michigan and 
America more prosperous than 
ever 
before 
with 
President 
Donald Trump in the White 
House for four more years and 
with God’s help.” 
Across the street from the 
Marriot, 
protesters 
stood 
outside 
of 
the 
Children’s 
Hospital to express discontent 

with 
Trump’s 
health 
care 
policies. Since Trump has been 
in office, he has undertaken 
efforts to repeal the Affordable 
Care 
Act 
and 
roll 
back 
protections 
for 
pre-existing 
health conditions.
Deirdre 
Waterman, 
mayor 
of Pontiac, Mich., spoke at the 
Michigan 
Democrat’s 
anti-
Trump protest outside of the 
hospital to denounce how the 
president has dealt with health 
care since taking office.
“He has shown insensitivity 
and a total lack of understanding 
of the need to provide affordable, 
quality 
health 
care 
options 
that 
everyone 
can 
afford,” 
Waterman 
said. 
“In 
budget 
after budget, he fought to slash 
critical programs like Medicare 
and Medicaid, thus taking them 
from so many who depend on 
them. We stand out here today 
as the voice, speaking loudly 
and 
emphatically 
for 
those 
who you cannot hear. We want 
real solutions to real problems, 
not fake solutions and empty 
promises.”
Pam Borowi, a supporter of 

Trump and Rochester Hills 
resident, spoke to The Daily after 
the rally about her consistent 
support of the President and her 
experience at the rally. 
“I love Trump, and I love 
Pence, and I love everything 
they’re doing,” Borowi said. 
“Mike Pence outdid himself. I’d 
never heard him speak before, 
but he’s very charismatic and 
I really enjoyed hearing him. 
He tells it like it is. He’s very 
authentic.” 
LSA senior Kate Nachazel, 
former vice president of the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans, said in a statement 
to The Daily she supported 
Trump and Pence’s choice to 
host a rally in Michigan.
“Pence 
coming 
back 
to 
Michigan 
reaffirms 
that 
Michigan will be a key swing 
state in 2020,” Nachazel said. 
“Because it was so narrowly 
won in 2016, it is unsurprising to 
me that Trump and his team are 
starting early and prioritizing 
in Michigan.”

GERSTEIN
From Page 1A

LSA senior Sulayman Qazi 
said he was inspired by the 
speakers, 
the 
Assembly 
and 
Gerstein. He was discussing how 
his boyfriend purchased a scarf 
in Jerusalem from a Palestinian 
vendor to send a message of unity 
when Mozhgan Savabieasfahani, 
environmental 
toxicologist 
and Ann Arbor City Council 
candidate, 
interrupted 
Qazi’s 
speech, calling for the Assembly 
to condemn sending military aid 
to Israel. 
“Heartwarming stories are not 
going to do it,” Savabieasfahani 
said. “Just pretty words mean 
nothing. Cut military aid to 
(Israel). Cut it off!” 
Audience 
members 
called 
for Savabieasfahani to sit down. 
Savabieasfahani 
continued 
speaking for approximately two 
minutes, at which point she left 
the meeting. 
Gerstein 
apologized 
for 
comments 
he 
made 
about 
Palestine 
in 
a 
2017 
video 
interview and op-ed. In a public 
apology posted to his Facebook 
page, he called his comments 
racist and harmful.

“The Palestinian community 
at this University is a community 
of this University,” Gerstein said. 
“We have a duty as a governing 
body 
to 
ensure 
Palestinian 
students don’t feel like they don’t 
have a space.” 
Qazi 
then 
finished 
his 
comments with a call for unity. 
The 
resolution 
condemning 
Gerstein’s comments passed with 
25 in favor and four abstentions. 
The Assembly then passed 
a resolution calling on the 
University to end its contract 
with Delta Airlines in response 
to the airline making hundreds 
of deportation flights for ICE in 
2019. 
LSA freshman and ex-officio 
member 
Drishaan 
Jain 
said 
the resolution is less about the 
financial impact on the airline 
and more about the Assembly and 
the University taking a stance on 
injustice. 
“We talked more last week 
about how if the goal of this 
resolution is to be more of a 
monetary or financial step that 
we are trying to take or if it’s just 
a symbolic resolution to show 
that the University wants to end 
its partnership with the company 
that is doing the deportation 
flights,” Jain said. “The focus of 
the resolution is … more about 

our partnership with them.” 
Rackham student Siddharth 
Singh Chaudhari raised concerns 
about the resolution’s efficacy 
and 
sentiment, 
saying 
the 
resolution was a form of tokenism 
in regard to the experience of 
undocumented immigrants. He 
said the resolution achieves little 
due to Delta’s limited response to 
the CSG action. 
“I think that a resolution of this 
nature smacks of us wanting to 
wipe off guilt without necessarily 
looking to achieve things that are 
tangible,” Chaudhari said. 
Chaudhari also noted some 
Assembly members said they 
would want a Taco Bell on 
campus after the company has 
been criticized for its workplace 
practices. 
“Taco 
Bell 
is 
notorious 
for 
hiring 
undocumented 
immigrants, 
absusing 
them 
through long hours of work, and 
underpaying them,” Chaudhari 
said. “Are we now going to pass 
a resolution sanctioning the 
University’s relationship with 
Taco Bell as well?”

C

riticism 
against 
the 
Electoral 
College 
has 
been 
mounting 
for decades. However, it has 
become a talking point for 
major presidential candidates 
after a 2000 and 2016 disparity 
between the popular vote and 
electoral 
majority 
collected. 
Many 
Democratic 
hopefuls 
including Mayor Pete Buttigieg 
of South Bend, Ind., Sen. Amy 
Klobuchar, D-Minn., Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt. and Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren, D-Mass., have spoken 
out in support of a popular vote 
system, but candidates former 
Vice President Joe Biden and 
former Mayor of New York Mike 
Bloomberg have voiced concerns 
about the abolishment of the 
current system. The narrative 
around the Electoral College 
is frequently about how much 
power individuals in small states 
have. This narrative must shift 
to a voter power index weighing 
how much power someone in a 
“battleground state” has over 
every other voter.
The 
term 
“voter 
power 
index” is how likely your vote 
is to sway the overall electoral 
vote in a presidential election. 
The mathematical calculation 
is coined as the Banzhaf Power 
Index, which allows groups 
to 
determine 
which 
states 
are crucial to the success of 
a candidate aiming for the 
presidency. By using a voter 
power index, we shift from the 
narrative of small states having 
all the power under the current 
electoral system to the idea that 
a select group of individuals and 
states hold all the power. The 
states responsible for deciding 
elections, a group of tossups, 
can be defined as the 13 that do 
not have uniform party support 
in the past four presidential 
elections.
The 
traditional 
measure 
of electoral power relies on 
the number of constituents 
per representative there are 
in each state, but the sparsely 
populated 
states 
never 
end 
up deciding elections. While 

it 
is 
true 
that 
Wyoming 
has the smallest number of 
constituents per electoral vote, 
the state is considered one of 
the most reliable for Republican 
candidates and has not voted for 
a Democratic candidate since 
1964. The same is true on the 
Democratic side with Vermont 
and the District of Columbia, 
which have been deemed two 
of the most reliably Democratic 
voting blocs. This model of 
understanding the downfalls 
of 
the 
electoral 
college 
is 
outdated as it has Florida, a 
state considered a consistent 
battleground 
state 
that 
frequently 
decides 
elections, 
ranked 
as 
the 
50th 
most 
powerful state. These seemingly 
over-powerful small states have 
monolithic 
political 
support 
making their votes count even 
less under the system that 
is meant to ensure the equal 
nature of their vote. 
In the 2016 election, the 
“battleground” 
states 
were 
home to 94 percent of general 
election campaign events, which 
in turn allows for candidates 
to build messages to appeal 
to narrow coalitions within 
traditionally indecisive states. 
This disparity in campaigning 
played out across the board as 
the smallest nine states with 
high electoral power received 
zero combined visits while 
California, Texas and New York 
received a combined two visits. 
The current system protects 
only those states deemed swing 
states, neglecting the states 
it was originally meant to 
protect, as well as those that 
make up the largest portion 
of the nation. Voter power is 
determined by how much a 
presidential 
candidate 
must 
pay attention to your state, 
rather than allowing for all 
votes to be considered equal 
and forcing a sweeping message 
from candidates. 
The 
current 
system 
requires 
a 
constitutional 
amendment to abolish the 
Electoral 
College 
process 

and put in place a popular 
vote. Passing an amendment 
is virtually impossible as it 
requires two-thirds of the 
House and Senate, as well as 
three-fourths of the states. 
While 
65% 
of 
Americans 
support a popular vote, a 
divided government proves 
to be a hurdle we cannot 
overcome at this time. 
In 
the 
meantime, 
the 
importance of having your 
voice heard takes precedent 
and 
the 
flawed 
system 
works in favor of University 
students 
and 
Michigan 
residents. Behind Michigan, 
most students attending the 
University of Michigan are 
from 
New 
York, 
Illinois, 
California and New Jersey, 
all 
reliably 
Democratic 
states 
with 
low 
voter 
power indices. In contrast, 
Michigan is within the top 
most influential states in 
the 
upcoming 
presidential 
election. University students 
have the option to re-register 
to 
vote 
in 
the 
state 
of 
Michigan as they reside in 
the state for the majority of 
the year. 
While the system is deeply 
flawed, 
working 
against 
the states and constituents 
it’s intended to protect, the 
U-M student voice is more 
important than ever with 
one of the nation’s highest 
voter power indexes at our 
fingertips. The 2020 election 
will prove to be a tipping 
point in deciding the future 
of our country that directly 
impacts University students 
with lasting effects that will 
outlive most of the voting 
population. With an increased 
amount of voting power and 
the largest voting bloc, it is 
imperative for U-M students 
to register to vote, remain 
educated and take to the polls 
in upcoming primaries and 
the general election.

A 

new 
carbon 
tax 
has 
the 
possibility 
of 
revolutionizing 
our 
push toward carbon neutrality 
by 2050, but it isn’t from the 
progressive playbook, it’s from 
the Republican Party. Despite 
decades of proposed climate 
legislation 
from 
Democrats, 
Republican stonewall opposition 
has limited progress toward 
cleaner 
energy. 
Not 
only 
could this new carbon tax be 
revolutionary, 
it 
could 
also 
be an indication of a renewed 
Republican Party, one more 
willing to contribute to climate 
policy in the future.
Energy 
markets 
are 
commodity 
markets 
— 
they 
follow supply and demand. As 
any good consumer would in 
any commodity market, average 
Americans want to pay the lowest 
price for gas and their monthly 
electric bill. As such, there is 
demand in the energy market for 
low costs that is satisfied by the 
cheapest energy sources: fossil 
fuels. Yes, they are cheap, but 
they’re also polluting the earth, 
leading to the catastrophic events 
of the climate crisis. Market 
forces alone will keep the energy 
sector and the planet on the 
same current trajectory: private 
profit and collective human 
suffering. However, a carbon tax 
could reorient the priorities of 
the energy sector by providing 
an incentive for cleaner energy. 
The leading concepts of a carbon 
tax involve a tax that would be 
collected primarily from the 
producers 
and 
importers 
of 
fossil fuels. Coal would be taxed 
at the mine, natural gas at the 
processing plant, petroleum at 
the refinery and imported fuel 
at the border. The tax would 
be based on the carbon content 
of the fuel, and the rate would 
increase over time. A carbon tax 
would incentivize companies 
to pollute less, and the market 
would trend toward cleaner 
energy. 
However, a carbon tax has 
yet to be implemented in the 
United States because of the 
preoccupation with the harsh 
economic effects on consumers, 
especially those with lower 
income. Whenever the costs of 
production increase, a company 
will 
charge 
the 
consumer 
more, and that’s exactly what 
would happen with a carbon 
tax. A carbon tax makes energy 
production more expensive for 
the fossil fuel industry, and they 
would offset that cost increase 
by charging more for their 

product. The cost of filling your 
car with gas and paying your 
bills at the end of the month 
would 
increase. 
When 
the 
French government attempted 
to impose a carbon tax on their 
population, there were mass 
protests lasting for months. 
Dubbed 
the 
“Yellow 
Vest 
Movement,” French citizens took 
to the streets in the hundreds of 
thousands to protest the carbon 
tax. Wealthier people aren’t as 
preoccupied with a carbon tax 
since they can afford it, but those 
who are less affluent are much 
more affected as they have to 
spend a larger percent of their 
income than wealthier people.
A 
new 
plan, 
however, 
effectively 
implements 
a 
carbon tax without leaving a 
heavy financial burden on the 
consumers. The Conservative 
Case 
for 
Carbon 
Dividends, 
conceived of by the Climate 
Leadership Council, describes, 

“All proceeds from a nation’s 
carbon fee would be divided 
equally among its citizens, and 
returned to all adults through 
a 
quarterly 
dividend 
check 
automatically deposited in their 
bank accounts.” In other words, 
the government wouldn’t collect 
the taxes, the money would 
go directly into the pockets of 
American citizens to offset the 
increased costs of buying gas and 
turning the lights on. This isn’t 
from Andrew Yang’s playbook. 
It’s a conservative, Republican 
proposal, and it’s a derivation 
of universal basic income. This 
carbon tax proposal is supported 
by a coalition of economists, 
scientists, 
corporations 
and 
leaders 
in 
the 
energy 
industry such as Shell, BP and 
ExxonMobil, and 3,554 U.S. 
economists, many of whom are 
conservative.
A market-based solution is the 
Republican policy of choice on 
most issues, including this new 
and improved position on climate 
change. The conservative case 
for carbon dividends already has 
bipartisan support and promises 

an economic and environmental 
benefit. This isn’t the same 
Republican Party that brought 
snowballs 
onto 
the 
Senate 
floor and vigorously denied the 
existence of climate change for 
decades. The Republican Party 
has an amazing opportunity 
here to accept the reality of 
climate 
change 
and 
grow 
environmental protections while 
sustaining economic growth. In 
comparison to enormous climate 
spending bills, such as the 
Green New Deal, a Republican 
climate stance could create an 
opportunity for the party to 
return to fiscal conservatism 
as well. Meanwhile, without an 
ambitious climate policy, the 
Republican Party risks losing 
younger voters who care about 
climate 
change. 
The 
party 
has everything to gain from 
embracing a conservative idea of 
carbon pricing, taking the lead 
on climate policy in a politically 
viable, 
economically 
and 
environmentally 
sustainable 
manner.
Even so, this isn’t to say that 
Republicans 
are 
champions 
of climate policy. They have 
never been, and they still are 
not. Their climate policy for 
the last 30 years has been 
complete 
denial, 
and 
still 
today a Republican president 
is 
stripping 
environmental 
protections in our national 
lands and pushing for increased 
use of fossil fuels. Whether 
they openly admit it or not, the 
Republican strategy has largely 
remained a strict denial. But the 
Conservative Case for Carbon 
Dividends may be an indication 
of a change in the Republican 
ideology 
that 
might 
prove 
essential for substantial climate 
discussion going forward.
The U.S. is not on the right 
track 
to 
reaching 
carbon 
neutrality by 2050. A one-sided 
approach from the Democrats 
has 
seen 
little 
success 
so 
far 
because 
of 
Republican 
opposition, but a rebirth of 
the Republican Party in terms 
of 
fiscal 
conservatism 
and 
environmental protections could 
be the answer for climate policy 
in the U.S. This conservative 
carbon tax may not be the whole 
answer, but it could be a symptom 
of a renewed discussion about 
climate change in this country, 
and a precursor of Republican 
contribution 
to 
necessary 
climate policy.

C

ollege can be stressful. 
For any student reading 
this, 
that 
statement 
probably seems obvious. Of 
course we are stressed when we 
have projects due and exams 
to study for while we also try 
to ensure we are making the 
most of our four years at the 
University of Michigan. But 
why are we stressing more 
than older generations did 
when they were in college? 
Mental health disorders in 
adolescents and young adults 
have significantly increased 
within the last 10 years. 
For the current generation of 
college students, stress seems 
inevitable. We are sent into 
college with a weight on our 
backs to come out knowing 
what we want to do for the rest 
of our lives. In reality, only 27 
percent of college grads work 
in a job that is directly related 
to their major. I am a junior 
and have already changed my 
career path at least five times, 
and I can only imagine how 
many more times I will change 
my mind over the course of 
my life. All the extra stress 
that 
accompanies 
worrying 
about the future isn’t worth it. 
Small amounts of stress may 
motivate you to complete daily 
challenges and reach goals, but 
when stress builds up it can 
affect your mental and physical 
health. Common symptoms of 
stress include headache, muscle 
tension, fatigue, irritability, 
stomach upset, sleep problems, 
etc.
A simple way to view stress 
is with the following analogy. 
Imagine there is a volcano 
in the middle of a remote 
island. Villages surround all 
sides of the volcano and it is 
a central part of the island’s 
landscape. Each village on 

the island performs different 
tasks. For example, one village 
grows fruits and vegetables 
to 
maintain 
nutrition 
on 
the 
island, 
another 
village 
constructs comfy beds out of 
the palm leaves to ensure that 
the islanders sleep well and a 
third village plans parties for 
all the islanders to attend. You 
are the volcano, and stress is 
the lava inside. If you don’t take 
care of stressors as they come 
up, they can boil up inside of you 
just like a volcano, until finally 
it erupts and lava spreads 
throughout the villages like 
stress spreading to all the parts 
of your life — from appetite to 
sleep to social interactions. 

How do we take care of 
stress once we identify that 
it is affecting our lives? This 
looks different for everyone 
and it is important to find what 
ways work best for you. Stress 
relievers can include working 
out, meditation, laughing with 
friends or, my personal favorite, 
playing with a pet. 
Most of us don’t have our 
pets at school with us, but all 
of us actually do have access 
to this stress reliever. Every 
Wednesday there is a wellness 
dog 
at 
University 
Health 
Services that students can visit. 
Multiple studies have explored 
the 
relationship 
between 

human -animal interaction and 
stress levels. One study found a 
significant increase in plasma 
oxytocin levels after human 
animal interaction. Oxytocin 
expresses anti-stress effects 
by decreasing stress hormones 
and 
reducing 
stress-related 
parameters such as heart rate 
and blood pressure. 
Another stress reliever we 
have access to is exercise. 
There 
are 
three 
gyms 
on 
campus that have a variety of 
equipment and fitness classes 
available to students. If you are 
not a fan of the gym, there are 
also sports clubs on campus 
and recreational sports teams 
that you can join. Working out 
can reduce stress by decreasing 
adrenaline and cortisol. In 
addition 
to 
reducing 
these 
stress hormones, working out 
increases endorphins which 
can elevate one’s mood. 

Counseling 
and 

Psychological Services at the 
University 
offers 
apps 
for 
guided meditation, along with 
other emotional and mental 
health well-being apps. CAPS 
also provides “Wellness Zones” 
that have massage chairs and 
sun lamps for students to use. 
The Wellness Zone on central 
campus is expected to open in 
the Union after Spring Break. 
Sometimes it would be nice 
to drop everything and travel 
to that remote island with the 
volcano, but realistically, we 
have to meet ourselves where 
we are. Since our generation 
already suffers from increased 
mental 
health 
disorders, 
implementing a plan to reduce 
stress may be more crucial 
for our health than we ever 
thought.

When stress builds 
up it can affect 
your mental and 
physical health.

With his pale white skin and deep red 
hair, Archy Marshall is more like a human 
embodiment of a cigarette than he is a singer/
multi-instrumentalist. He’s got the voice to 
match, too: gnarled, deep and gruff. Rather 
than let his unconventional appearance and 
voice hold him back, he leans directly into 
it, using the combination to create stunning 
visual art and haunting recorded music. 
His work under his given name is great, but 
his work under the moniker King Krule is, 
somehow, even better. 
As 
King 
Krule, 
Marshall 
creates 
a 
moody, visceral amalgamation of punk and 
jazz (among countless other genres) and 
incorporates various art forms into his 
products, specifically his music videos. His 
videos alone are works of art; add music to 
them and they become transcendent. Each 
of his album covers are designed by him, 
too. He even included a 208-page book filled 
with visual art for his 2015 release A New 
Place 2 Drown. His career under the moniker 

took flight after the release of 6 Feet Under 
the Moon in 2015, carried by underground 
hit, “Easy Easy.” His next release, 2017’s 
sludgy and dark The OOZ, catapulted him to 
alternative stardom. 
Marshall’s most recent release, Man Alive! 
makes his state of mind apparent immediately. 

It opens with “Cellular,” a glistening, bass-
heavy rocker marked by weird horn blasts 
and electronic gurgling. While not outwardly 
downcast, the lyrics detail the disintegration 
of Marshall’s relationships with loved ones 
and his relationship with the world around 
him. The ominous atmosphere defines the 
first few songs of the album, reaching its apex 
at “Stoned Again.”
“Stoned Again” is Man Alive!’s crown jewel. 
The guitar-driven instrumental is sludgy and 
scuzzy, not unlike Southern stoner metal. 
Marshall’s voice is raw and downtrodden, if 
not angsty, delivering disheveled lines about 
the aimlessness of youth with drunken, 

stumbling precision. “Down in the dirt / I 
used to surf with my bucket from Kentucky 
/ I had a scratch card, I scratched so hard 
/ ‘Cause I’m feelin’ fuckin’ lucky, boy, I’m 
feelin’ so lucky,” he sings (shouts?) in the first 
verse, his disconnect with society around 
him almost palpable. With this song taken in 
the context of the previous two, it seems that 
Marshall is only going to spiral deeper into 
this hole as the album progresses.
However, it’s not so. Immediately after 
“Stoned Again,” the tone shifts. “Comet Face,” 
similar in sound and delivery to “Stoned 
Again,” marks a realization in Marshall that 
his mentality is not sustainable. The angst 
and disconnect with society completely fades 
away by the time “Alone, Omen 3” begins to 
play. Man Alive! comes at a pivotal time in 
Marshall’s life — he and his girlfriend and 
frequent collaborator had their first child in 
early 2019. “Alone, Omen 3” is a representation 

of this change. It is a somber revelation that 
the path of life you choose doesn’t matter — 
all that matters is you got to this point at all. 
His words are confident, yet his voice still 
seems unsure, with 
lines like: “The ache 
and thunder in the 
storms of your mind 
/ Soak it in, for 
the rain will pass 
in time / nothing 
wrong in sinking 
low / You’re omen 
of paradise.” It’s as 
if he knows that his 
life and everyone 
else’s is going to 
turn out fine, but he 
just needs to see it 
in action before he 
can believe it. 
The 
remainder 
of 
Man 
Alive! 
continues delving into Marshall’s revelation 
on “Alone, Omen 3,” reckoning with his new, 
uneasy outlook on life and trying to figure out 
how he will move forward. Unfortunately, the 

songs begin to wallow in lethargy, exacerbated 
by the fact that each song runs seamlessly into 
the next. But maybe that’s what makes Man 
Alive! special — it shows a man wrestling with 
his thoughts in real 
time. 
As 
the 
album 
comes to a close, 
Marshall 
drops 
one 
more 
gem: 
“Energy Fleets,” a 
sparse, 
beautiful 
song about turning 
the pages of life, 
eager and unafraid 
to 
see 
what’s 
next. What makes 
“Energy 
Fleets” 
special, 
though, 
is Marshall’s slow 
devolution 
into 
nothing more than 
a 
distorted 
voice 
slowly chanting, “Such a funny life,” as if to 
say that it’s worthless to try to make sense 
of it because life is just going to keep getting 
funnier.

King Krule grows just a little bit on ‘Man Alive!’

MUSIC REVIEW

WIKIMEDIA

I heard the piano’s haunting melody before 
I opened the door. Melancholic chords echoed 
through the Dance Building’s underground 
practice room. The production crew, director 
and choreographer stood against the floor-to-
ceiling mirror while the dancers’ bodies moved 
as if suspended in water. All I could hear 
was their feet skidding on the floor, labored 
breathing, the snapping of Hannah’s camera 
and the piano. There was a sign to remove 
shoes, transforming the subterranean space 
into sacred ground.
On that Friday night practice, the entire 
cast rehearsed for “And We Look On,” a 
puppetry and dance performance focused on 
environmentalism. Music, Theatre & Dance 
and LSA senior Isabel Olson described the 
show as “a 30 to 40 minute piece that touches 
on both the natural beauty of our world but also 
the decay and dilapidation that is being caused 
right now by humans.” 
This 
week, 
Olson’s 
vision is coming to the 
stage at the Duderstadt 
Center Video Studio this 
Thursday, Feb. 27 and 
Friday, Feb. 28 from 7 to 
8 p.m.
The 
performance 
is a journey through 
an 
idealized 
world, 
our 
current 
reality 
and the wasteland — a 
representation 
of 
our 
future. Conceived by Olson this past October, 
“And We Look On” uses screen projections, 
puppetry, dancing and original music written 
by Cole P. Abod. 
“Puppetry, to me, simply means animating 
an object and realizing that almost any object 
can come alive,” Olson said. “That became 
a really good metaphor for this show where 
everything we touch in this world is trash. So 
it is bringing to life the beauty of this world 
through waste just spoke to me, as that could 
be puppetry so easily.” 
In her role directing the cabaret dance show 
in the fall of 2018, Olson met Music, Theatre 
& Dance senior Johanna Kepler, a dance major 
and now the “And We Look On” choreographer. 
For Kepler, the scenes depicting the “shadow 
world” presented the biggest challenge (but 
were also the most fun). Staging the transitions 
between having dancers in 3-D and also 
behind a screen required her to stretch her 
imagination. 
Kepler listed packing peanuts, Meijer bags, 
umbrellas and cellophane as just some of the 

recycled items used in the show. She found that 
art through movement and dance is a radically 
different experience from reading a headline 
or statistics, which can desensitize the public. 
“I want the audience to be confronted, to 
reflect and be uncomfortable,” Kepler said. 
“And by uncomfortable, I mean, opening up 
a dialogue that is important to have, but may 
not be something you talked about with your 
friends on a day to day basis.”
While choreographing the piece, Kepler 
wondered how we evoke emotion to spark 
action. 
“The way I’ve been doing that is making 
superhuman moments where there’s a clear 
human connection on stage,” Kepler said. 
Olson was floored by the cast and crew’s 
willingness to take risks and help her bring 
this small idea to life. 
During their break, I sat with the dancers 
on the floor as they stretched, tired but still 
smiling at 7:30 p.m. on a Friday. Senior Matthew 
Standerski, sophomore Atticus Olivet, junior 
Alana Pollard and sophomore Claire Vogel, 
all Music, Theatre & 
Dance majors, spoke of 
their passion for their 
performance’s message 
that combines activism 
and theatre. 
All 
the 
dancers 
mentioned the cross-
disciplinary nature of 
the show, with members’ 
majors 
ranging 
from 
history, theatre, dance 
and art. The group’s 
cross-disciplinary 
membership is a feature they consider one of 
their greatest strengths. 
“Because it’s a piece that didn’t exist before, 
it feels deeply personal. You can point to and 
say, ‘Oh, I remember the day that we decided 
that was going to be in the piece,’” said Pollard. 
“I think the whole piece feels so deeply rooted 
in collaboration. And that’s what makes it feel 
really special.”
Standerski found that though “And We Look 
On’s” uses minimal resources, a production 
can still do so much with so little. He noticed 
how it’s easy to slip into feeling helpless, but 
art is able to show the profound ways in which 
people can make a difference. 
“The cool paradox of it is we’re making 
something beautiful out of the trash and the 
recycled material. And that will live in people’s 
minds longer than the trash that they throw 
away every day.” 
“And We Look On” will perform at the 
Duderstadt Center Video Studio Thursday, Feb. 
27 and Friday, Feb. 28 from 7 to 8 p.m. It is free 
to all audiences.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
Black-and-white ‘Parasite’ 
enhances the Oscar winner

92 years after the creation of the Academy 
Awards, the acclaimed South Korean film 
“Parasite” made history as the first non-
English language film to take home Best 
Picture (in addition to Best International 
Feature, Best Original Screenplay and Best 
Director, a sweeping victory that ties Bong 
Joon-ho, “Memories of Murder” director, 
with Walt Disney for most Oscars won by 
a single person in a single night). To the 
delight of fans, “Parasite” was re-released 
in theaters across the U.S., with distributor 
Neon hoping to capitalize on the inevitable 
surge in interest that follows any Best Picture 
winner, let alone one of such historicity.
Alongside this re-release is the special 
opportunity to see “Parasite” in a brand-new, 
yet old-fashioned manner: Neon has greenlit 
the release of a black-and-white version of 
the film, done on the special request of Bong. 
Some might scoff at this practice — at one 
point it was all the rage to colorize old films, 
and now we’ve reached the point where we’re 
decolorizing new films. But this trick isn’t 
completely novel, having been done by recent 
films such as “Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015) 
— a movie which director Bong has declared 
himself a big fan of — in addition to Bong’s 
own film “Mother” (2009) back in 2013.
So what’s the point? It isn’t some creative 
choice vital to the artistic vision of the film; 
“Parasite” wasn’t made with a monochrome 
palette in mind, unlike 2019’s Best Foreign 
Language Film winner “Roma” (2018). In 
an interview at the black-and-white film’s 
premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival, 
director Bong explains how he, his director 
of photography and the film’s colorist had 
to go back over each frame and correct 
grading in order to make it look pristine. No, 
the answer is not so auteurist, but it’s still 
a matter of personal vision — in the same 
interview, Bong explains that part of the 
decision to decolorize was simple vanity, a 
sort of childhood wish fulfillment. To him, 
many of the classics are black-and-white, so 
why not make his crown jewel project a little 
more classic?
Casting the world in grayscale didn’t 
magically transform the film into some new 
creature; it’s still “Parasite,” with all the 
same thrills and laughs and gasps. This was 
my third viewing of the film, and it remained 
as powerful as my first, and that’s thanks 
to the masterful direction, writing and 
performances — elements that unsurprisingly 
proved stronger than the realism that color 
adds. 

But the decolorization does have its 
consequences, and some of these effects 
were delightfully appropriate to the film’s 
portrayal of class conflict. With only white 
and black and the grays in-between, the 
contrast between the affluent Parks and the 
crafty but low-on-cash Kims is substantively 
starker (the film’s promotional materials, 
with black or white bars placed over the eyes 
of both families, comes to mind). The palatial 
home of the Parks is all the brighter, with 
the glass walls and wide windows letting 
in buckets of whitewashing light. While 
the affluent are graced with lighter tones, 
the Kim sub-basement home is noticeably 
drearier, the dim light beam that leaks in 
from the narrow window feeble in contrast to 
all the deep gray that surrounds it. Without 
the distraction of color, movement and 
performance became more important, the 
sound of Min’s feet sticking to the unclean 
Kim home floor becoming distinct. All these 
elements were there in the color film, but 
in the monochromatic makeover they are 
underscored and augmented.
Other aspects of the film are more or less 
in line with Bong’s aspirational musings. 
He’d be happy to hear that being black-and-
white did lend “Parasite” a slightly more 
old-timey, prestigious feel. At the same time, 
the image quality was anachronistically 
clear and well-defined, lacking the grainy 
texture and slight haziness endemic to that 
era. This visual discordance isn’t a nuisance 
though — in fact, it imbued the film with 
something of a timeless quality. Despite 
being set in and specific to Seoul, “Parasite” 
has resonated with audiences across the 
world.In an interview with Birth.Movies.
Death., Bong himself credits this to the fact 
that “essentially, we all live in the same 
country: Capitalism.” The strangely classic 
yet modern feel of the film made it all the 
more universal.

But maybe that’s what makes 
Man Alive! special — it 
shows a man wrestling with 
his thoughts in real time

While not outwardly 
downcast, the lyrics detail 
the disintegration of 
Marshall’s relationships 
with loved ones and his 
relationship with the world 
around him

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
Review: ‘Clone Wars’ final season
Black excellence 
gala closes out 
history month

SARAH PAYNE
For The Daily

Approximately 80 students, 
faculty 
and 
community 
members 
celebrated 
Black 
History Month at the Black 
Excellence 
Gala 
in 
the 
Union 
Tuesday 
evening. 
The gala included cultural 
performances and a buffet of 
soul food and African dishes 
and was sponsored by the 
Office of Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs. 
The event drew attendees 
from several Black cultural 
organizations 
on 
campus 
and in the community. These 
performances 
included 
singing, dancing, spoken word 
poetry and music. Additionally, 
there was an art gallery in the 
ballroom that featured Black 
art, photography and other 
creative pieces. 
Andrew Ward, Multi-Ethnic 
Student 
Affairs 
program 
manager, issued opening and 
closing statements for the gala. 
He expressed his gratitude for 
everyone who helped with the 
festivities of Black History 
Month this year and said he is 
excited for the future of this 
event. 
“It was such an incredible 
opportunity to work with these 
students, and it would not have 
been possible without them,” 
Ward said. “We want this to 
happen bigger and better next 
year, we would love to have all 
of your support next year as 
this is the final, closing event 
for Black History Month.”

Engineering 
freshman 
Maureen 
Thomas 
attended 
the event and reflected on her 
excitement for the cultural 
performances. 
“I am a part of the Latinx 
community on campus, and 
I came to support the Afro-
Latinos and to celebrate the 
culture here and have some 
fun,” Thomas said. 
University 
of 
Michigan 
alum Mariah Smith said she 
was excited to attend the 
event with her younger sister. 
Smith, who was also a featured 
performer in the event, said 
she 
appreciated 
how 
the 
community came together to 
celebrate black history. 
“For me, this event means 
a lot,” Smith said. “To see 
everyone come together and 
pull together this inaugural 
Black Excellence Gala is very 
important, and as an alumni to 
this University, it is very nice to 
be able to come back and be a 
part of this celebration and to 
be a part of history.”
LSA 
junior 
Madison 
Murdoch, who also attended 
the event, said she hopes the 
University will continue to 
host and support events like 
these.
“I find it really important to 
support Black History Month 
initiatives, their programming 
and events because if student 
support shows up then more 
of these events happen, and 
I think that it’s important,” 
Murdoch said.

Break-up Series: Date in the MET

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

The following review contains spoilers.
“Star 
Wars: 
The 
Clone 
Wars” 
gets 
resurrected for its seventh and final season 
after a seven-year hiatus following its 2013 
cancellation. 
Unlike 
Emperor 
Palpatine’s 
resurrection in “The Rise of Skywalker,” the 
final season of “The Clone Wars” sets itself as an 
expected progression of the “Star Wars” saga — 
a fitting coda to the ending of a trilogy.
Fans of “The Clone Wars” animated series 
may remember that season six was truncated 
down to 13 episodes from the original episode 
count in the 20s. The episodes, unable to be 
released under its syndicated network Cartoon 
Network, were released through Netflix. 
Season six (also called “The Lost Missions”) 
began to lay the groundwork of the show’s 
grand finale with the potential uncovering of 
the Sith plot of Order 66, meandering toward 
the characterizations and adventures of 
multiple members of the Jedi Council such as 

Mace Windu or Yoda. 
The premiere of season seven, called “The 
Bad Batch,” spends little time situating you 
into the final stages of the Clone War — a 
marked change of pace that sets you toward the 
denouement portrayed in “The Revenge of the 
Sith.” While you are drawn back into the setting 
and tone of the final season, you may find 
yourself enamored with the character focus of 
the premiere: the clone soldiers (Dee Bradley 
Baker, “Family Guy”).
Have you ever wondered what your 
inner monologue may sound and look like? 
Baker’s performance as clone hero favorites 
Rex and Cody alongside the titular Bad 
Batch commandos leaves very little to the 
imagination. Baker’s performance as the Bad 
Batch, clone troopers with “desirable” genetic 
mutations, is perhaps amongst the actor’s 
greatest vocal performances. While portraying 
each individual clone trooper with their own 
personality through different inflections of 
the pervasive “clone trooper voice,” Baker 
also perfectly encapsulates the bickering of 
the common foot soldier, dripping with the 

balance of tension and camaraderie. You 
wonder if Baker’s inner monologue is as eclectic 
— perhaps even as chaotic — as his masterful 
portrayal of at least eight different clones. 
Baker’s performance of the clones proudly 
displayed in the premiere paints a somewhat 
different tone and picture of the denouement 
of the Clone War. In “Revenge of the Sith,” the 
focus of the film lies in Anakin Skywalker’s 
(Hayden Christensen, “The Last Man”) fall 
to the dark side. True to the series’ role as a 
complement to “Revenge of the Sith,” “The Bad 
Batch” is the harbinger of the denouement of 
auxiliary fighters and characters — chief among 
them the clones. While it may be disappointing 
that neither Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein, 
“Avengers Assemble”) nor any Jedi have major 
appearances in the premiere, you can take 
comfort in the expectation and inevitability 
that each character will also find their own 
conclusion. While the premiere of “The Clone 
Wars” may seem underwhelming at first 
glance, it ultimately succeeds in setting up the 
conclusion of many of your favorite, auxiliary 
characters.

My worst first date ever began at Steps on 
Broadway, an old dance studio on New York 
City’s Upper West Side.
I wore a purple leotard and grey biker shorts 
with my hair in braids to a full afternoon class. 
I remember the gorgeous Spanish teacher 
coming up to me at one point during barre and 
instructing me to drop my tailbone so my butt 
didn’t protrude in a grand plié and thinking 
how out of shape I was.
I made eye contact with a younger man who 
had shaggy brown hair and an air of confidence 
about him that the professional dancers who 
take classes at Steps can never seem to leave at 
the door. 
Still recovering from breakup depression, I 
just focused on completing the hour and a half. 

By the time the last combination of jumps came 
around, I noticed this young man was allowing 
me to go in front of him. I was so zoned out that 
he gave me a short laugh and motioned me in 
front of him. 
I jumped and twisted in the air, thanked the 
teacher and finished class. Safely in the hallway 
and feeling very good that I made my way here, 
the boy from before appeared in front of me as I 
was changing into street shoes. 
“Hi. I’d like to take you to the Met,” he said. 
“What?”
“I dance for New York City Ballet, so I get free 
tickets. I would like to take you to the American 
Ballet Theater’s end-of-season performance.” 
He ran his hand through his shaggy hair.
“Um … okay. That sounds awesome.”
“Okay. So meet me at the Met at 8 on 
Saturday.”
“Like the Metropolitan Opera? At Lincoln 
Center? With the fountain and everything?”

“Yeah. Can I have your number?”
With my new Saturday night plans, I floated 
back to the couch I was crashing on at 191st 
Street. 
Three days later, I wore a pair of Converse 
and a Scotch & Soda dress in front of the Met 
with a dead phone and only a vague memory 
of what this boy looked like. I eventually found 
him next to the fountain, and we walked in 
together. 
“So there’s this guy called Balanchine, 
and he choreographed a couple of the pieces 
tonight,” he said.
“I know who Balanchine is.”
“Oh. Well, this company shouldn’t really be 
doing these pieces because City Ballet is trained 
specifically-”
“I know. I actually know some people in City 
Ballet. I used to train with them.”

Welch said his experience going 
through the prison and then the 
parole process makes him a good 
mentor for others.
“I realized that my personal 
history is a part of what forged 
the 
path 
for 
me 
to 
make 
communication and connection 
with people so we can resolve the 
issue as much as we can,” Welch 
said.
State Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann 
Arbor, 
and 
Kyle 
Kaminski, 
Legislative 
Liaison 
for 
the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 
Corrections, described resources 
provided 
to 
people 
recently 
released from prisons. Kaminski 
said he doesn’t feel there are 
enough resources for citizens 
returning home from prison. 
“I don’t think we’ve done 
enough as a state,” Kaminski said. 
“I think we’ve done a lot compared 
to other states, but there’s a lot of 
opportunity to make things better, 
and I think we’ve made some 
progress over the last few years, 
but I think there’s more progress 
to be made. … These types of 
discussions can have a far greater 
impact on communities around 
the state than most people are 
willing to recognize.”
 
Irwin shared his thoughts on 
the need for emotional support 
resources for those who have 
just returned home after being 
incarcerated.
“There’s the mental, emotional 
and social side of it,” Irwin said. 
“That is very important and there 
are some policy things that we 
need to be doing in Lansing to 
address those issues as well.”
Malachi Muhammad, employee 
at The Lunch Room and formerly 
incarcerated person, said for many 
returning home who are Black or 
Latinx, there is a lack of mental 
health support, due to preexisting 
cultural stigmas in each group. 
Mary 
Heinen 
McPherson, 
co-founder of the U-M Prison 
Creative 
Arts 
Project, 
also 
discussed 
struggles 
regarding 
mental health. She said she felt 
left behind by half of her former 
friends and family and was unable 
to contact the people she had 
formed bonds with while in prison 
due to MDOC regulations.
“When I came home, I was 
lonely,” Heinen McPherson said. 
“My whole life had been inside 
of a prison along with those of us 
that were all locked up together. 
So, to live with everyone that 

you knew all those years in four 
different prisons and then come 
home and be told, ‘It’s a violation 
of your parole if you have contact 
with anybody,’ you’re like, ‘What 
the hell am I going to do now?’ 
Everybody that you knew and 
loved was inside. I was ostracized 
from the community.”
Heinen McPherson shed light 
on the unique struggles that 
she encountered as a formerly 
incarcerated woman. 
“I can tell you that out of the 
thousands of women that I knew 
all those years and that I know 
now,” Heinen McPherson shared. 
“I don’t know anybody that didn’t 
suffer some major trauma, sexual 
assault, abuse or some terrible 
thing that shaped what happened 
to them before, mostly during, 
and after prison. With women, the 
primary consideration is children 
and family. There’s a lot of drama 
around kids and what’s happened 
to the mama and the grandma. 
And that’s something that we don’t 
talk about much.”
As the Q&A session began, 
Kaminski discussed the ways 
in which formerly incarcerated 
individuals are often discriminated 
against while attempting to secure 
housing. He said landlords often 
use a felony as a proxy for race 
when looking at possible tenants. 
“I think a lot of landlords use 
criminal history, which is an 
allowable exclusion, as a proxy for 
not allowed exclusions, like race,” 
Kaminski said. “I think folks need 
to be really careful about that, 
because why are they excluded 
based on criminal history?”
Irwin talked about eliminating 
the 
box 
on 
job 
or 
school 
applications that asks whether an 
applicant has committed a felony.
“We need our government to 
pass laws like ‘Ban the Box,’” Irwin 
said. “We need our government to 
rebuild these kinds of programs 
in the community like we used to 
have that would support returning 
prisoners. I think this really 
connects directly to this whole 
question of, ‘How do we help 
businesses feel comfortable hiring 
returning prisoners? How do we 
help landlords feel comfortable 
renting to these folks?’”
Welch also talked about the 
importance of voting and getting 
involved with politicians to pass 
legislation that will help formerly 
incarcerated people as well as 
those currently incarcerated.

Mann, Mayotte working to fix habits

After practice ended Monday 
at Yost Ice Arena, after most of 
the team and the coaching staff 
had retreated up the stairs to the 
locker room, Strauss Mann and 
Kris Mayotte — and a handful of 
forwards — were still on the ice.
The sophomore goaltender 
and his position coach had a 
conversation at the far end of 
the ice before moving to the net 
at the near end. While Mann got 
settled in the crease, Mayotte 
explained what he wanted from 
the forwards he’d chosen to help 
with the drill.
Two steps to pick up speed, 
a quick catch of the pass and a 
speedy release on the shot, either 
shooting short side as Mann 
moved from left to right to the 
near post or pulling the puck to 
the backhand to go for the far 
post. 
In many ways, it mirrored the 
goal Notre Dame forward Cam 
Morrison scored on Mann to 
make the score 2-0 on Saturday 
— a game that ended in a 3-0 
loss for Michigan. Morrison flew 
down the left wing, waited just 
long enough for Mann to bite and 
roofed a shot short side, popping 
the lid off Mann’s water bottle in 
the process.
“It’s really the only situation 
that he’s kinda faced this year 
that he doesn’t have a real 
in-depth plan on how he wants 

to play it, or at least a plan that 
he’s really comfortable with,” 
Mayotte said Tuesday. “We’ve 
talked about essentially the 
situation when Morrison scored, 
we’ve talked about that specific 
situation a couple different times 
this year and finally — I think 
he was like, ‘Aw, well, how often 
does it happen?’ But after that 
one he’s like, ‘Well, we need to 
figure this out and come up with 
a plan.’ ”
It was at least the fourth goal 
Mann has given up in essentially 
the same situation this season. 
Mayotte recalled similar goals 
against Minnesota in November, 
Penn State in January and 
Wisconsin earlier this month. 
Mann and Mayotte share a 
similar goaltending philosophy 
— neither likes to work on 
specific situations week-to-week 
unless it’s truly necessary.
But, after Morrison’s goal, 
Mann decided he’d given up 
goals in that situation one too 
many times. Before practice 
Monday, he met with Mayotte to 
figure out a new plan. The two 
bounced ideas off each other, 
came up with a few things to try 
after practice and took the ice 
ready to solve it.
“My job is to know his game 
well, but he’s the one that 
ultimately has to execute it, so 
the plan has to be comfortable 
for him, not for me,” Mayotte 
said. “ … It’s just bouncing ideas 
off, going through the mental 

reps and then the physical and 
seeing what feels right.”
When making adjustments 
in the middle of the season — 
especially a season like Mann 
is having, as he is currently 
ranked sixth in the nation in save 
percentage at .934 — Mayotte 
knows he has to be careful. 
Change too many things, and 
it could throw the goaltender 
out of the fundamentals and the 
rhythm that have brought him 
success throughout the year.
But with Mayotte’s focus on 
fundamentals and fixing bad 
habits only when it becomes 
absolutely necessary, he can find 
the balance.
“I’m a big believer that at this 
level, you have a lot of goalies 
who can stop pucks,” Mayotte 
said. “It’s making sure that 
they’re consistent. Helping them 
be consistent. They put in the 
work.”
Added Mann: “In season in 
general, for goalies, you try to 
look at things that need to be 
fixed but maybe not go into the 
deeper stuff. Like, if there’s 
something in the pre-scout of 
another team or just a bad habit 
you’re getting into, then you 
might try to fix that, but nothing 
too technical or about changing 
your whole game until after 
season.”
As Mayotte explained it, the 
situation Mann kept finding 
himself in is tricky due to the 
number of options the skater has 
with the puck. But with just a bit 
of work Monday after practice, 
Mayotte and Mann feel they’ve 
figured out a plan and fixed the 
habit without making changes 
that are too dramatic.
“It’s hard, because you’re 
trying to cover the whole dang 
thing,” Mayotte said. “When 
(the skater has) the puck all the 
way out (there), it makes the net 
more like eight feet wide rather 
than six because you have to get 
outside your posts to stay square.
“It’s a tough one, but we’re 
working on it. I think we came 
up with a plan.”

‘M’ youth shines against Spartans

Standing at the podium in 
front of TV cameras and a gaggle 
of reporters, Michigan State 
coach Suzy Merchant stared 
emptily into the background. 
Her team just lost to Michigan, 
getting swept for the first time 
since 2015, and Merchant was 
looking for an answer.
“This was sort of a step 
backwards 
for 
(sophomore 
forward 
Kayla 
Belles 
and 
freshman 
forward 
Taiyier 
Parks),” Merchant said. “I think 
those two kids are very young, 
first year kids. … I’m proud of 
how they’ve developed, but you 
can also see their youth on a 
night like this. They can have 
some slippage.”
The two combined for 23 
minutes and three points.
Twenty 
minutes 
earlier, 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico beamed behind the same 
podium, counting out on her 
fingers the names of the five 
players who finished Sunday’s 
65-57 victory over the Spartans.
“Who’s going to be the next 
man up?” Barnes Arico said. 
“And Maddie Nolan rotated 
onto 
(Spartan 
guard 
Taryn 
McCutcheon) 
and 
Michelle 
Sidor took Maddie’s matchup 
and those are two freshmen. So 
we’re just talking about a lot of 
young kids who just came in, on 
the road, in a rivalry game, when 
the other team went back up and 
took the lead, and were able to 
win the game down the stretch.
“If you say Maddie Nolan, 
Michelle Sidor, Izabel Varejão, 
Naz Hillmon and Amy Dilk, 
that’s three freshmen and two 
sophomores.”
Barnes Arico finished her 
sentence with an emphatic, 
“Yeah!” and a fist pump, her 
smile nearly splitting her face.
With senior guard Akienreh 
Johnson and junior forward 
Hailey Brown out with injury, 
the three freshmen — Nolan, 
Sidor and Varejão — combined 

for 63 minutes and 13 points.
Since 
Nolan’s 
emergency 
call up to the starting rotation 
in early February, she’s been a 
stalwart defender and has found 
a way to contribute to the team 
in any way imaginable, whether 
it be blocks, assists or rebounds.
In her first 21 games as a 
Wolverine, Nolan played 6.33 
minutes per game. In the last 
six games, she’s 
played 
30.33 
minutes 
per 
game 
— 
only 
costing the team 
once, 
when 
she fouled out 
against then-No. 
19 Northwestern 
on Feb. 13.
Sidor, 
meanwhile, has 
emerged 
from 
a slump to start the Big Ten 
season. In part due to injuries, 
she’s earned Barnes Arico’s 
trust to play in big moments 
and be an offensive spark for 
Michigan.
Varejão has had her own 
rough 
patches, 
and 
her 
continuous foul troubles detract 
from her potential as a day-in, 
day-out double-double threat.
“I told Izabel the last couple of 
days,” Barnes Arico said. “ ‘You 
are getting a double-double. 
I’m feeling it, today is your day 

Iz. We need your toughness, 
we need your strength, today is 
your day for that double-double.’ 
And darn she was pretty close, 
if she wasn’t in foul trouble so 
much, she probably would have 
gotten it.”
When she sets foot on the 
court with Brown or sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon, 
her 
offensive talent is immediately 
noticeable. 
Varejão, in the 
last 
couple 
of 
weeks, 
finally 
became 
the 
bench 
threat 
Barnes 
Arico 
has needed all 
season. 
When 
she gets on the 
court 
opposing 
defenses 
are 
immediately 
thrown off-center, leading to 
bursts of scoring.
So Sunday, when Johnson 
and Brown fouled out and 
the 
Wolverines’ 
youth 
was 
thrust into the most hostile 
environment 
Michigan 
has 
faced all year, they were ready. 
The three had hit their stride.
Instead 
of 
leaving 
their 
coach standing on the podium, 
blaming youth and talking about 
what could have been, they left 
her beaming and dreaming of 
what’s to come.

UConn exposes Michigan’s flaws

Four games. Three losses. 
Two weekends. One opponent. 
Through the last 14 days, the 
Michigan baseball team has 
grown familiar with UConn. 
The 
Huskies 
weren’t 
the 
toughest opponent it faced in 
that time. It wasn’t even the best 
team the Wolverines played 
— that title is reserved for the 
likes of Vanderbilt and Arizona 
State. But there’s something 
special about UConn, the only 
one to find success against 
Michigan, with a win on Feb. 
16, followed by a 2-1 series win 
last weekend.
UConn, having made the 
regional 
tournament 
three 
of the last four years, acts as 
somewhat of a measuring stick 
for 
Michigan. 
Wolverines’ 
coach Erik Bakich preaches 
that if you want to be the best, 
you have to play the best.
But in a weekend series that 
could have solidified Michigan’s 
early-season prowess against 
a successful northern program 
that the Wolverines have aimed 
to emulate in the past few 
seasons, they fell flat. 
It’s not that the Huskies’ 
strengths exploited all of the 
Wolverines’ weaknesses. It’s 
the simple fact that everything 
Michigan did wrong over the 
weekend, UConn did right. 
Whether 
it 
was 
the 
production from the bullpen 
or stringing consistent quality 
at-bats together or gaining 
momentum at the right time, 
whenever Michigan faltered, 
the 
Huskies 
made 
exactly 
the right moves to exploit its 
mistakes. 
“They just are solid in all 
phases,” Bakich said. “They 
have good starting pitching. 
They have bullpen matchup 
guys that can come in and throw 
multiple pitches from the right 
and left side. They have speed 
and power in their lineup.”
Michigan utilized a total of 
eight bullpen pitchers in the 
series. Freshman left-hander 
Jacob 
Denner 
— 
the 
only 
Wolverine to earn a win — 
pitched four innings, amassing 

just two strikeouts as he closed 
out a blowout win on Saturday.
“Definitely the first and 
third day weren’t what we 
wanted,” Denner said. “But I 
really think we showed what 
we could do on day two from a 
hitting standpoint and from a 
pitching standpoint as well.”
In Friday’s game, freshman 
right-hander Cam Weston and 
senior left-hander Ben Keizer 
combined for four innings, six 
hits and two earned runs out of 
the bullpen. While this would 
normally be a 
solid 
outing, 
the Wolverines 
did not perform 
well enough to 
cling to the lead 
that 
starter 
Jeff 
Criswell 
left 
behind. 
Each 
pitcher 
performed in a 
similar capacity 
in a relief effort 
on Sunday, earning comparable 
stat lines and the same result — 
a loss.
UConn’s bullpen, meanwhile, 
was able to sustain leads and 
allow its offense time to climb 
out of deficits.
“We let some innings get 
away from us,” Bakich said. 
“That was uncharacteristic — 
we usually have a very reliable 
and capable bullpen.”
Inconsistent bullpen pitching 
coupled with a lack of consistent 
offensive production spelled 
doom for the Wolverines. Over 
the course of the series, out of 

a total of 100 at-bats, Michigan 
hitters struck out 36 times. In 
the two losses, the Wolverines 
racked up 17 and 13 strikeouts, 
respectively. 
“We need to do a better job 
hitting good pitches with less 
than two strikes and battling 
with two strikes,” Bakich said. 
UConn’s strikeout count on 
the 
weekend? 
Twenty-four. 
That 12 strikeout difference 
between the two teams is four 
full innings of hitters, potential 
base 
runners 
and 
hopeful 
scorers. 
These 

strikeout 
numbers — an 
average 
of 
12 
per 
game 
in 
the 
three-game 
series 
against 
the 
Huskies 
— are a slight 
increase 
from 
the 
numbers 
from the opening 
weekend, 
where 
the 
team 
averaged just under 10 per 
game. 
UConn 
did 
not 
exploit 
this 
weakness, 
but 
rather 
capitalized on Michigan’s self-
inflicted harm. The Huskies 
simply did everything right that 
Michigan did wrong.
“Even though UConn is a very 
good club and has historically 
been a good club, a consistent 
regional team,” Bakich said. 
“I thought the lack of success 
this weekend is us pointing the 
thumb at some of our lack of 
execution, and that is really it.”

Wolverines see pitching struggles 

During the second game of 
the Gamecock Invitational, Alex 
Storako stepped onto the mound 
in hopes of leading Michigan past 
Iowa State.
Replacing junior left-hander 
Megan Beaubien, in the top of the 
seventh with the score tied at one, 
the sophomore right-hander came 
in for a relief effort.
Getting into her normal groove, 
Storako allowed a sacrifice bunt 
and struck out the next batter. 
But that groove was short-lived.
Storako walked the next batter 
and her pinch-runner stole second 
allowing an extra run to score 
on a single batter later. With two 
runners crossing home, the score 
was 3-1 for Iowa State. Things 
seemingly couldn’t get much worse 
for the Wolverines, until Storako 
walked the next batter and allowed 
for a double down the left-field line, 
scoring two more runs.
Eventually, 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol Hutchins pulled Storako for 
freshman right-hander Chandler 
Dennis — the first time this season 
Michigan has pitched three of its 
pitchers in one game. It was also 
Dennis’s collegiate debut.
“I think collectively as a team 
we weren’t at our A-game,” Storako 
said. “I just think that we came 
back from South Carolina with a 

lot of things to work on and I know 
that we’re really getting at those 
things and we want to get better 
for the next weekend coming up.”
Over the past two weekends, 
Michigan’s pitching has been lights 
out. This weekend, that wasn’t the 
case. Ultimately, pitching dug holes 
for Michigan that it couldn’t climb 
out of as it dropped three of four 
games on the weekend.
Even 
Beaubien, 
Michigan’s 
typically reliable ace, contributed 
to the struggles. She started 
against Iowa State and struggled. 
While she had seven strikeouts and 
allowed two runs on four hits in six 
innings, facing Liberty her stats 
told a different story. She allowed 
one run on two hits pitching only a 
part of the final inning.
“We just gave up too much,” 
Hutchins said. “And whole ball 
over whole plate doesn’t usually 
work out very well. And it didn’t. 
Video shows that those pitches that 
they hit out at very untimely times 
were just right there and well hit, 
well swung. But you know what’s 
done is done. This is our first day to 
get back and work a little bit on our 
spin and work on our movement, 
and really more than anything 
work on our mindset.”
While its pitching struggled this 
weekend, Michigan understands 
the importance of full team 
competition. 
This 
weekend, 
pitching struggled tremendously, 

and it put pressure on the offense 
to produce — another thing the 
Wolverines struggled with.
“I think our offense, we always 
are striving to kind of support 
our pitchers so kind of give her 
a cushion so we don’t put all the 
pressure just on her,” sophomore 
catcher Hannah Carson said. “So I 
think when there were hits here in 
there off of Chandler we were just 
thinking we need to start stringing 
our hits together, we need to start 
connecting with the ball so we can 
help all our pitchers out.”
Next weekend, the Wolverines 
play in the Judi Garman Classis 
tournament. 
It 
features 
the 
toughest teams Michigan may 
face in its nonconference slate, 
including 
No. 
2 
Washington, 
No. 3 Texas and No. 25 Texas 
Tech. Michigan will need to look 
toward sorting out its pitching 
struggles before facing some of the 
best power-hitting teams in the 
country.
“We can only do what we do,” 
Hutchins said. “We’ll need to 
pitch, throw pitches to beat, not 
throw pitches to not get hit. And 
the mindset of our pitchers has to 
be one pitch focus and throw every 
pitch to beat the hitter. We need 
to just throw with confidence, 
knowing that mistakes will get hit 
and we just gotta trust that (the 
pitchers) part of the game is to keep 
us in the game.”

P

ink and yellow flowers covered the ovular bead 
that hung on a dainty gold chain swinging in the 
window of BRECA, a vintage shop in Pristina, 
Kosovo. The necklace attracted me from the street on a 
day I’d set out exploring the city which would become my 
temporary home during a summer project. I rushed into the 
store to purchase the piece, and once inside, found myself 
circling the aisles uncovering more jewelry, headwear and 
fabrics like none I’d encountered before. I purchased the 
necklace and perused every other item in the store, feeling 
that I had stumbled on a treasure trove of untold stories in 
the secondhand items. 
When I feel uncertain about a new place I’ve moved to, I 
first head to vintage shops: They feel like places protected 
from the threats of consumerism and corporate harm. The 
items on the shelves bring with them lives, histories and 
stories about which we can only speculate. To what event 
was the silken scarf last worn? Did someone hike a moun-
tain or ford a river in those shoes? Was that ring gifted as 
a sign of affection to an antique love? Shopping at vintage 
stores makes me feel closer to the places I’ve moved because 
the items I purchase are spared the sterility of newness. It’s 
easier to start my own story in such a place because every 
find reminds me that the story does not begin with me. 
The stories uncovered in vintage stores are not the same 
histories popularized in textbooks, with dated details of 
long-gone battles or forged legal codes. Instead, antique 
collections reveal the personal, accidental and private: 
Postcards between long-distance lovers, clothes faded from 
years of wear and diaries with sprawling drawings in the 
margins all fuse to tell the human stories of a particular 
place. Shopping at vintage stores shows me a place’s history 
better than anywhere else.
Vintage store finds harbor more than their own stories, 
too. I grew up performing in the theatre, where clothing 
from vintage shops was a necessity for stocking the dressing 
room shelves. Historical time periods came to life authen-
tically in the costumes we cobbled together with found 
textures and already-worn garments of vintage stores. The 
costumes used in one play were saved in warehouses for the 
next and always worn by someone else, who would enact 
an entirely different storyline — before myself or another 
became the bearer of it. The same piece of clothing served 
countless fictional lives during its tenure in the theatre and 
likely many more in reality, too.
Clothes and thrifted objects seem embedded with stories, 
both real and fake, and when we donate old clothes, their 
meaning multiplies with new ownership. Thrifted objects 
are a way we share stories — they are a physical object in 
which our lives intersect.
Growing up, I loved the story of the “Sisterhood of the 
Traveling Pants,” which imagined a pair of faded jeans that 
magically fit each of the four main characters who tried 
them on, carrying with them the lives of each other. Each 

friend wears the jeans and then writes about the experi-
ence to the others to tell them what type of lives the pants 
themselves have lived. There are stories embedded in the 
jeans, and as the girls go on experimenting in their lives, the 
pants collect and carry that storied trajectory. Collective 
ownership is more meaningful than single-wear, single-use 
purchases. The meaning objects hold multiplies when it is 
shared across lives and experiences.
I recently found a heavily annotated copy of W. H. 
Auden’s collection of poetry at my favorite vintage book-
store in Ann Arbor, Dawn Treader. I picked up the copy 
to find notes scrawled in smudged blue ink from cover to 
cover. The prose in the corners, handwritten by its previous 
owner, was just as resonant as the poems they encompassed. 
By the end of the book, I not only knew the chronological 
publishing of Auden’s work, but the nuances of a personal 
story of grief and heartache that a previous reader recount-
ed on their journey through the poetry. In reading from an 
already-treasured copy of the book, it became clear to me 
how often we write our stories in the margins, and between 
the lines, of others.
Beyond our personal histories, thrifted objects can tell us 
the pasts of places and systems bigger than ourselves, too. It 

is not hard to imagine the many antique tourist items scat-
tered across vintage shops that serve now as relics of places 
which are no longer: a replica of the Notre-Dame Cathedral 
in its fullest form preceding the fire that destroyed its like-
ness last year, or postcards presenting images of natural 
lands across South America now lost to endless deforesta-
tion across the continent.
In this way, vintage shops may also be places of despair, 
reminding us of lives that were, places that used to be and 
times in both personal and political histories which are long 
gone. When living in Kosovo, I wondered if I would ever 
stumble upon a sweatshirt emblazoned with “YUGOSLA-
VIA,” naming an empire that dissolved decades ago in war, 
maybe featuring embroidered skylines now lost. Kitchy 
reminders of a country that went on to carry a dark history, 
serve, too, as important pillars of remembrance. Before sec-
ondhand items can serve as generators of new stories, they 
first are collections of the old. 
Vintage shops, then, can help us understand our place in 
this complex and historical world, in places under constant 
change. The personal and political present themselves to us 
in relics. As any historian knows, what will be always starts 
with what is and what has been.

Ode to vintage stores

T

here was a big pond behind the 
third house of my childhood. 
The first night we moved in, 
all five of us ran down to it — my two 
brothers, mom, dad and me — and we 
slipped, slid and pushed each other across 
the ice. Snow was coming down from the 
sky in big chunks. (It was one of those 
typical winter nights, I’d later learn, that 
poised you well for a snow day the next 
day). We ran up from the pond after our 
new neighbor kindly asked us to quiet 
down and ripped off our sweatshirts and 
jeans — none of us had bought winter coats 
yet. Later that night, we all piled into the 
car and went to a store called Meijer that 
we’d never heard of before, picked out our 
own frozen meals and ate them in foldable 
chairs with disposable forks before falling 
asleep on air mattresses in empty rooms.
A new childhood was dawning — just 
like the two previous childhoods had. I’d 
spent the first eight years of life catching 
tadpoles and prancing around bayous in 
Houston and the next four finding ways 
to entertain myself in 110-degree Julys 
in Dallas, but moving to Grand Rapids, 
Michigan at age 12 was something 
distinctly foreign. The oceans, humidity, 
prairies, indefatigable heat and roaming 
steer of my early memories didn’t 
translate to the fenceless, green, fresh-
watered, snow-covered rolling hills of 
West Michigan.
I had to change my words, too: I quickly 
learned to say “you guys” instead of 
“y’all”; “pop” instead of “soda”; to put the 
emphasis on “sur” in “insurance” instead 
of on “in.” There are twangs my friends 
still tease me for which I never could quite 
kick, like how I pronounce “museum” or 
how I intonate “Grand Haven.” Certain 
words, pronunciations and phrases still 
walk out of my mouth like little skeletons 
from the South who refuse to be fully laid 
to rest.
This past December, I returned to 
Grand Rapids for a few days. I’ve gone 
each New Year’s Day since I left for 
college, which was around the same time 
my parents moved away again, this time 
to the West Coast. The first two years I 
returned to visit satisfied the 12 months’ 
worth of nostalgia for the place I came into 
adolescence — they satisfied my desire to 

return to the place I still considered home, 
even though my family had left. Even in 
December, my friends and I would drive 
to our old haunts, sometimes just to sit: 
Frosty Boy for the lemon soft serve, the 
Blue Bridge for a good view of the river, 
Lookout Park for another of the city, that 
one Meijer on the Beltline for whatever 
else we craved (the same one my family 
and I first ventured to 10 years ago for a 
snow shovel and frozen meals). 
But this past New Year’s Day was 
distinct. Instead of filling the ache of a 
homebound itinerant, the city made me 
feel like a stranger. New strip malls had 
appeared in place of what I remembered 
as roadside forests. The sandwich shop 
I’d worked at the summer I turned 17 had 
been replaced by a Thai fusion restaurant. 
The ice cream shack on the river we’d ride 
our bikes to before we could drive was 
gone. 
Even the people I saw — the ones who 
I see once a year at New Year’s Eve — felt 
like new people I was getting to know, not 
classmates, neighbors and teammates I’d 
grown up with. Few of us still belonged to 
the city we’d once held in common. Even 
if we ended up in the same college towns, 
we were no longer bound by the ritual 
duties of a shared hometown. Outside of 
Kent County, duties like jumping off the 
camelback bridge into the Thornapple 
River at dusk, like stumbling drunkenly 
through the Coast Guard Festival or like 
flocking to the 28th Street Steak ‘n Shake 
when you were high on a summer’s night no 
longer mattered. Ann Arbor has different 
rivers, different festivals and different 
Steak ‘n Shakes to be experienced. 
It seems like three years is the right 
amount of time for strangeness to set in — 
the right amount of time for the duties to 
fade and for new ones to take their places. 
When we were all together this past New 
Year’s Eve, we all seemed older to me, 
more mature for certain. More than that, 
each of us now belonged to new places and 
new people. It was like being wavering 
between two realms of reality. In the first 
realm, I knew the whole and complete 
picture of my friends’ lives: their classes, 
their sports, their hobbies, their other 
friends, their houses. All of this became 
uncertain in the second realm. Their lives 

became more blurry. 
I understood. Places change and people 
get older. I had my own new places and 
people back in Ann Arbor. The kids living 
in Grand Rapids now — who are familiar 
with the new strip malls, and the non-
sandwich shop, and the ice-creamless 
river, and the duties of home among a 
shared reality — will come back five years 
from now and feel the same way. It was 
still unsettling that for the first time since 
I was a teenager, Grand Rapids didn’t feel 
like home to me. 
When does a place start to feel like 
home, and when does it stop feeling like 
it? Even if I were to walk down the first 
block I have a memory of, Lymbar Drive 
in Houston, I’d be just another passerby 
with the vague recollection that I had 
drawn chalk on this sidewalk once, that 
I had scraped my knee on that curb, that 
I had learned to ride my bike over there. 
But Houston does not feel like my home 
— it hasn’t for a long time. Nor do Dallas 
and now Grand Rapids. I have a hard time 
understanding why.
I can’t help but wonder whether or 
not these places would feel like home if 
I’d lived in them for longer. What’s the 
threshold for acquiring a permanent 
home? Eight years, three decades, a 
lifetime? How long gone is long gone 
enough to feel like a tourist in the place 
that raised you? 
The places I remember growing up have 
morphed into an indiscernible yet colorful 
bundle of houses, stoplights, sidewalks, 
fences, schools and people. Instead of 
watching seasons pass by in the same 
backyard each year, I saw green summers 
and brown ones — ones with big fir trees 
and ones with dust. I saw winters both 
warm and cold — ones with shorts and 
soccer at the playground and ones with 
frozen ponds and snow days. As jumbled as 
my many homes and childhoods become, 
they will never be short on variety and I 
will never be short on empathy for those 
trying to make a new home in a new place.
Going “home” now to my parents’ house 
in Oregon is a day-long parade of early 
morning flights, layovers in Las Vegas, or 
Minneapolis, or San Francisco, or Seattle 
and an unhealthy dose of airport food. 
But miraculously I always end up on the 

opposite end of the continent feeling as 
though I’ve somehow traveled through 
time.
I have, in a way: Instead of a singular, 
fluid place, my idea of home is interspersed 
with hiccups and gaps, with changes and 
intervals. There is no handprint in the 
cement, no tree I always climbed, no one 
long, unhalting, unbroken memory of a 
home to which I can return.
There are odd interruptions in the 
otherwise continuous flow of a lifetime 
with each uprooting; odd interruptions 
that inevitably feel like time travel once 
I look back at them. Like how my family 
and I traveled through time as we drove 
northward to Michigan almost 10 years 
ago, watching winter become something 
unrecognizable as it passed us by in the 
car windows. Like how I traveled through 
time when I returned to Grand Rapids just 
a few months ago, only to see an entirely 
new city in its place. Like how I travel 
through time after coming back to Ann 
Arbor each fall with a breath of relief. No 
matter what I’ve been up to, this city feels 
the same. This city is home, at least for 
right now.
I’ve been here long enough to reach 
some of the typical benchmarks: My 
Ann Arbor address is on my I.D. and I 
have an Ann Arbor District Library card. 
There are the unwritten ones, too: I can 
figure out how to get back to my house 
without GPS if I’ve driven too far away, 
give a stranger directions and restaurant 
recommendations or tell you where 
and when the city’s swing dance group 
practices in the summertime.
Then there are the things which truly 
christen it as home, like the time my 
brother and I dove to the bottom of the 
Huron River over and over again to find 
the glasses he’d lost the day before. Or 
the time my roommate came to jump my 
stalled car in the middle of Liberty Street 
during rush hour. Or the evening they 
closed down all of State Street before the 
art fair, and I rode my bike back and forth 
down the middle of the road without a 
single car or person to look out for.

y favorite part of a Pure Barre 
workout is when we go into 
bridge lifts — upper back on the 
ground, pelvis pushing up toward the ceiling 
— because it’s the most overtly sexual thing 
we do, and it means class is almost over
Pure Barre was founded by Carrie Dorr 
in 2001, just outside of Detroit. Driven by a 
results-oriented “lift, tone, burn” mantra, 
Pure Barre focuses on low-impact, muscle-
burning movements intended to tighten and 
lengthen the body. Pure Barre Classic is the 
company’s original workout: Each class is 
designed to isolate various muscle groups 
using a ballet barre, two sets of light weights 
and tomato-colored balls and bands.
Each class is uniform and scary, the lights 
turning on, dimming, turning back on and 
turning off as a lean woman with hair the 
color of a maraschino cherry screams over 
the “50 Shades of Grey” soundtrack for you 
to “take your seat to your heels, halfway up 
and hold.”
I 

don’t know if anyone here is a sucker 
like me and does those barre classes 
where you’re supposed to sculpt your 
clit into an ancient arrowhead or whatever 
… ” (Jenny Slate said in her Netflix comedy 
special “Stage Fright.”)
Barre started as a way for women to 
strive toward and successfully experience 
better sex. In a piece for The Cut, Danielle 
Friedman writes that the woman who 
created barre, “Lotte Berk, a free-love 
revolutionary who began teaching the 
regimen in 1959, specifically wanted to 
advance what she called ‘the state of sex’ by 
encouraging women to pursue sex for their 
own pleasure.”
Berk was a German-Jewish dancer who 
sought refuge in London after the Nazis 
inhibited her career, and she radicalized a 
brand of fitness that was acutely erotic and 
prioritized female gratification. “Perhaps 
most famously,” Friedman writes, “she is 
rumored to have told clients, ‘If you can’t 
tuck, you can’t fuck.’ And her clients loved 
her for it.”
While modern-day barre isn’t about sex, 
there is a promise that it will make you 
sexier. This promise is buried in the fantasy 
that, one day, you’ll be desirable in the way 
that all “Barre Babes” are.
I imagine a Barre Babe as this: She has 
healthier hair than you and abs you can see 
through her tank top. She has clear skin and 
never wears makeup in class, which she 
takes every day because she’s tougher than 
you. She’s the exercise equivalent to author 
Gillian Flynn’s “Cool Girl”:
Being the Cool Girl means I am … hot and 
understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; 

they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner 
and let their men do whatever they want. Go 
ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool 
Girl.
We barre-goers pelvic thrust in an orbit 
around Barre Babe, hating her and the fact 
that we’ll never quite be her. She threatens 
and tinkers with our self-worth, so we pay 
for monthly memberships and $25 socks and 
tank tops that say “oh, tuck” because Barre 
Babe is toned and sexy, effortless and happy. 
We feel good about ourselves after each 
hour in the studio and book our next class 
from our beds, under a weighted blanket 
and a bag of chips.
Barre3, a cardio and strength-based 
workout, was designed by Sadie Lincoln in 
efforts to defy the Barre Babe mentality. 
Each 
class 
is 
similar 
without 
being 
identical: We warm up and hit each major 
muscle group, liberated to take or leave 
modifications along the way.
Lincoln and her husband Chris started the 
company in August 2008, with their flagship 
studio in Portland, Ore. There are now 148 
franchise studios around the world, all led 
by entrepreneurial women. She admits on 
National Public Radio’s “How I Built This” 
that when she first opened her doors, she 
was teaching 19 classes a day. “My body 
broke,” she said. “Literally, my back went 
out, and I remember my mom saying to me, 
‘Honey, you’re embodying your business.’ “
“I learned that to be healthy,” she 
continued. “It really is okay to pause, to 
not move, to not achieve, and to not have 
an outward expression of what exercise 
means.”
Barre3 and Pure Barre are not the 
same, but they’re clumped together in the 
world of boutique fitness, where Lincoln’s 
dream of murdering Barre Babe with self-
empowerment is brazenly weakened by 
female competition and the collective 
mentality that the grass is always greener on 
the other side. If only we could drop lower, 
if only we could hold a side plank, if only we 
could manage heavier weights — she’s doing 
it.
The summer of 2016, I started going 
to Barre3 in my hometown of St. Louis, 
Missouri because I wanted to look better. 
It beat the shit out of me, but I kept going 
back. My waist was getting smaller, and my 
thundering thighs were starting to slim. My 
arms were shedding the meat I’ve always 
hated about myself, letting muscles ripple to 
the surface.
Sumo-squatting once a week turned into 
two times, which eventually grew to four 
or five, and sometimes even six. I loved 
the escalating lightness of early morning 

classes, which I’d take with my mom before 
she left for work. The sky blushed, its rosy 
fever creeping onto our opening breaths 
as the sun rose on our thickening layer of 
sweat.
Barre3 made my whole body shake, pain 
giving way to a numb and premeditated 
quiver which instructors would croon 
was “my body changing.” I loved those 
changes; I felt powerful in them. Go ahead, 
make me pulse, I thought. I don’t mind, I’m 
the Barre Babe.
W

ellness is “the state of being 
in good health, especially as 
an actively pursued goal,” as 
stated by Merriam-Webster. Per mainstream 
refinement and capitalism, wellness is a 
catch-all. An empire has been built around 
the concept of “wellness” with various 
territories holding stake: boutique fitness, 
athleisure, minimalism, diet culture, anti-
diet culture, CBD, yoga. On and on and on.
The paradoxes of the wellness world — 
inclusivity and unattainability, envy and 
admiration, authenticity and superficiality, 
business and recreation — have no bearing 
on its ability to turn a profit. Wellness is an 
absorptive and active phenomenon, both 
in practice and principle, and it’s driven 
by results. People are making money, be it 
through genuine intention or a preying on 
pure anxiety, from other people wanting 
to become Barre Babe. The never-ending-
ness of that becoming is what continues to 
perpetuate and fund the culture. We can 
plank and step-tap and carousel-horse and 
squat and tuck and fuck however much we 
want, but it’ll never be enough. We’ll never 
be done.
A 

dear friend and forever muse 
recently took up yoga. Jack 
Brandon, recent LSA graduate 
and Daily Arts King, started in July 2019 for 
a few different reasons: “The first is that it 
became an easier option than going to the 
gym, which had started to become a chore 
and stopped being a comfortable way to 
exercise,” he said.
“The second reason is that my 
boyfriend had been doing it for a 
while and that made it a little more 
interesting to me. My friends had 
been doing it before, but I had 
assumed it was too expensive 
or too hard. I was fairly 
inflexible and wanted 
to save myself the 
embarrassment 
of not being 
able to hold 
poses. The 
third 
is 

that a yoga instructor I had met once told 
me I had a ‘very sexual energy.’ ”
Jack’s approach to yoga is deliberate: He 
wanted to be comfortable, he wanted to 
work out with his boyfriend and he wanted 
to feel sexy. The curiosity driving these 
wants — will it work? — is what keeps him 
going back.
Every Pure Barre class, after weight-
work and a thigh sprint, we stretch. The 
music slows into an acoustic serenade, or 
some melancholic electronica, and we’re all 
facing ourselves in the mirror, panting and 
alive, as we’re told to lean into our version 
of the splits, “pushing for equal strength 
and flexibility each class.” Sliding into the 
stretch, folding into my inner thighs as 
they settled on the ground without pain or 
force, took months of classes. And then I did 
it, and I felt comfortable and sexy and like 
something was working. This money I spent 
was working, my body was working. Jack, 
look, it works.
I

n the past decade, the ability of 
good health to serve as a marketing 
tool has blossomed, partly thanks to 
Gwyneth “I’d Rather Smoke Crack Than Eat 
Cheese From A Tin” Paltrow. She started her 
lifestyle brand, Goop, in September 2008, 
sending the first newsletter out to 10,377 
subscribers. The company went on to design 
detoxes and recipes, soon expanding their 
content to encompass understandings and 
anxieties experienced largely by women. A 
household 
name 
herself, Paltrow 
recruited 
other 
divinely 
feminine 

celebrities to contribute to Goop’s operation: 
Bryce Dallas Howard wrote a personal 
essay on her journey through postpartum 
depression and Beyoncé donated a pair of 
shoes to Goop’s “annual charity closet sale.”
Goop’s mission is simple. They want to 
create change, whether that be in your or 
for you: “We don’t mind being the tip of the 
spear — in short, we go first so you don’t 
have to.”
The current culture of the wellness 
industry offers the control that Goop is 
advocating for, straddling a marketable line 
between the choices we’re currently making 
and the choices we could make, if only we 
had the right guidance. You have to buy into 
the ethos that Goop proposes, which isn’t 
hard to do when you’re burdened by the 
deeply human struggle of trying to navigate 
who you are and who you want to be. The 
wellness industry sells the merging of the 
two, monetizing the possibility of being at 
peace with yourself while capitalizing on 
the potential that you might have to be even 
better.
Writer Jia Tolentino talks about the 
phenomenon of self-improvement in her 
recent collection of essays, “Trick Mirror.” 
In a chapter titled “Always Be Optimizing,” 
she acknowledges the “real pleasures” 
available in self-improvement, like the 
ability “to understand your physical body as 
a source of potential and control.” She also 
asserts that the beauty ideal promoted by 
the endless search for a best-self can drag 
women into “a paradigm where a woman 
can muster all the technology, money, 
and politics available to her to actually 
try to become that idealized self, and 
where she can understand relentless

What happens when 
you find your “best 
self,” 
only 
to 
realize 
that 
this 
self 
isn’t 
who 

you thought it might be? Where do you 
turn when you’ve exhausted the avenues you 
believed to be in your best interest, avenues 
you invested in under the impression that 
you were investing in yourself? What now, 
Barre Babe?
P

ure 
Barre 
tracks 
your 
class 
milestones: 100, 250, 500, 740, 
1,000, 1,250. There are barres 
outside of the studio room, nailed to the wall 
for people to autograph at each mark. When 
I hit 100 classes, I signed the barre closest 
to the ground and got a free pair of sticky 
socks, fresh with a silvery “100” circled in 
glitter.
I started Pure Barre when I started 
college, and only because there’s not a 
Barre3 in Michigan. I grew to crave it — 
maybe I have an addictive personality, 
maybe I just like mindlessly air-humping to 
a club remix of “Losing My Religion.”
Nearing my 250 mark, my socks are still 
impressively sticky and beginning to thread. 
They catch the light that’s always dimming 
and keep my toes from betraying me during 
the plank at the beginning of class and the 
end of class and sometimes the middle, if 
I have the pretty instructor with the foot 
tattoo. Once I hit 250, I’ll get new socks, and 
then I’ll get another pair at 500. The stakes 
keep rising and I keep going and paying and 
lifting and toning and burning in the name 
of self-improvement. For a workout that’s 
supposed to slow me down, I feel like I’m 
moving faster, racing no one and competing 
against everyone for the next milestone 
that I have to have, even if no one but me 
cares that I have it. You got me, Jia — I’m 
relentless.
A

fter my 229th class at Pure Barre, 
I walked home to make dinner. 
Stirring my layman’s version of 
Goop’s Vegan Cashew Tomato Soup recipe 
next to a poster of the man Gwyneth Paltrow 
consciously uncoupled from in 2016 (Here’s 
looking at you, Chris Martin), I asked Jack 
to take me to yoga. He said yes and we made 
a date for the following night, when I fed 
him the soup and we walked to his regular 
studio together.
Like Barre, yoga is sexy, especially in 
dim rooms that pulse with a warm glow 
and boast temperatures over 90 degrees. 
The practice bloomed from India, the 
word “yoga” derived from “yuj,” which 
is Sanskrit for “to unite” or “to 
join.” India is also home to the 
Kama Sutra, or 
“Teachings 
on Desire,” 
which 
is 
an 
ancient 

Sanskrit manual for emotional and erotic 
fulfillment. Google “yoga” and “Kama 
Sutra” together, and you’ll find headlines 
like “Kama Sutra or Sex-Yoga?” and “The 
Yoga of Pure Sex.” You won’t believe what 
you can do with your body, we’re told, and we 
want to know.
We put our mats down and Jack 
immediately took off his shirt, laying on his 
back with the soles of his feet pressed into 
one another and his knees spread wide. I 
looked down at my covered chest and leaned 
back to copy him.
Yoga was hard and hot, and I sweat more 
than I was ever allowed to at Pure Barre, 
where fans tirelessly thrum in the hopes 
of keeping everyone’s hair comely enough 
for life outside of the studio. The men in 
the room kept peeling whatever fabric 
they could from themselves as the women 
flowed in their damp sports bras. There was 
a liberation in moving however I wanted 
to move. I left loose and warm, a feeling I 
haven’t had since my sunrises at Barre3.
F

our months into his yoga practice, 
Jack can now fold over his legs, 
hold a bridge pose, and kick up 
into a handstand (I saw this last triumph 
confidently and drunkenly executed against 
the string-lighted, cotton candy blue walls of 
a friend’s Kerrytown apartment. Very cool.).
“I keep going back because I like feeling 
that strong, graceful feeling,” he said. “(It’s) 
like holding two things I thought were in 
opposition together in one. It feels very yin 
and yang.”
And I guess the merging of this dichotomy, 

the “yin and yang” Jack feels when he’s 
doing something he thought his body might 
never be able to do, is what “optimizing 
yourself” feels like, as Tolentino would put 
it. I feel this whenever I go to Pure Barre, 
and still, the grass could be greener, my 
body could do more, my mind could rest 
easier. That’s why Pure Barre will never be 
Barre3 and why Barre3 will never be yoga 
and why yoga will always make me crave the 
former of the two even more. I can be tough 
enough to tuck and strong enough to squat 
and balanced enough to breathe through a 
backbend, but to what end?
S

oftness is critical to success in 
yoga — and barre and breath and 
sex, even. You have to abandon the 
mentality that failure looks or feels a certain 
way and surrender to the experience. I’m a 
sensitive person; I always have been, and 
surrender doesn’t come easy. I was often 
told to “toughen up” and “be less delicate” 
and these demands had consequences, 
devilishly redefining the facets of a gentle 
person into fears: soft mind, soft heart, soft 
stomach.

In the summer of 2017, I was diagnosed 
with celiac disease, a lifelong autoimmune 
condition in which the intake of gluten 
attacks my small intestine. Celiac is a result 
of a genetic predisposition and can be 
developed at any age. My gastroenterologist 
— one of the three women who I’m pretty 
sure saved my life — thinks I had celiac for 
roughly two years before being diagnosed. 
At the end of those two years, I spent eight 
hours in the emergency room getting a 
stranger’s B+ blood pumped into my left 
forearm.
When 
someone 
with 
celiac 
eats 
enough gluten, they’ll eventually become 
malnourished. I needed iron infusions 
and two units of blood and a bronzer 
that would distinguish me from a ghost 
(something I hope another South Indian 
woman never has to say).
My body no longer operated under 
the agreed upon terms and conditions 
of the organized fitness I was actively 
participating in, but that didn’t stop me from 
trying. I made deals with myself: If I had the 
extra drink or ate the extra chocolate, I had 
to book a workout. I wasn’t soft, and I wasn’t 
going to stop just because I didn’t feel well. 
I hauled myself to Pure Barre through the 
snow, during dusky, undiagnosed February 
mornings — the same month I started 
getting charley horses in my calves from 
just walking to class. After the night in the 
emergency room, I took four days off before 
returning to barre. I pushed myself until I 
broke, and then I kept going.
I started toeing a fine and fragile line once 
barre became a habit: Barre Babe is cute, but 
at what cost? Was I going because I needed to 
do something that made me feel like myself, 
or was I going because I was worried about 
what would happen to my body if I stopped?
D

ownward Dog in the back of 
the room, I glanced over at Jack, 
who was dripping sweat as he 
shifted his body’s weight to rest on one leg, 
leveling his waist for balance as he lowered 
his chest to the floor. I was jealous — not that 
he could move his body this way, but that he 
was brave enough to move fearlessly. After 
I got diagnosed with celiac, I showed my 
body no mercy. Soft mind, soft heart, soft 
stomach. I’d remind myself what to resist 
— not pausing, still moving, forcing myself 
to achieve, as though there was glamour 
to be won in being strong enough to suffer. 
“Health” became an empty word. I forgot, 
either tenaciously or in a blind rage, what 
the woman behind Barre3 wanted her 
community to know: Taking a break is okay, 
failing is okay.
Seeing Jack’s sweat slip down the new 
contours of his back as he lost and gained

his stability filled me with purpose: a new way to pause, 
a new way to move, a new way to achieve.
I 

spent the past three summers working the front 
desk at Barre3 in St. Louis. I kept the studio sunny 
and followed the morning and evening checklists 
for glorified janitorial duties: mopping the floors, deep 
cleaning the bathrooms, bleaching the weights.
The best part of the job was the complimentary classes, 
quickly followed by overseeing child care. Our studio 
offered free babysitting for members, many of whom I 
got to know as I bonded with their children, who were 
anywhere between 6-months-old and 12-years-old.
I befriended the kids, especially when my shifts started 
falling into a groove, sticking me with the same 9 a.m. 
crew every Tuesday morning. Returning each summer, 
I’d see the same littles, only a bit bigger and sometimes 
with a new sibling on the way.
The humid months I spent barefoot in the studio 
completely immersed me in a deeply physical and 
feminine environment. I became more aware of my 
own body and the ways in which I took up space both 
within the studio and outside of it. I noticed the kids I 
was watching — especially the young girls, still years 
away from puberty, hormones and many rock-bottoms 
with the potential to deeply fracture their relationships 
with their bodies — peering over the wooden door of the 
childcare corner and into the studio. They’d make faces at 
the women, spotting their own mothers and replicating 
her postures.
More and more, fresher demographics, especially young 
girls, are tempted by the vague novelty of the wellness 
industry’s practices. This past August, Weight Watchers 
released Kurbo, an app designed for “adolescents” aged 
eight to 17. In a statement for USA Today, dietitian Sheri 
Kasper said “The problem with tracking foods, as Kurbo 
has its users do, is that it can become an obsession and 
result in control-driven behaviors that can lead to eating 
disorders.”
We’re living in a moment of feverish preoccupation. 
To quote Mariah Carey circa 2009, “Obsessed, obsessed, 
obsessed, obsessed, obsessed.” We obsess over ourselves 
and devote energy to molding ourselves into Barre 
Babes or Cool Girls or whatever else we can, and the 
wellness industry helps us. But what happens when this 
obsession blooms in kids? I’m 21 years old and obsessed 
with redefining my own health as it exists today. I hate 
to think of an eight-year-old feeling the same way, and I 
wonder what my mom would think of what I think, and 
what her mom would think of what she thinks.
B

arre Babe is sexy, Barre Babe is at peace with 
her body, Barre Babe doesn’t exist. Flickers 
of her live in our sticky socks and the moxie 
that makes us put them on, but she’s a caricature of a 
woman who will never be done becoming whatever it is 
she wants to be. We can control this becoming through 
Goop or Pure Barre or Barre3 or anything, really, that 
the wellness industry offers a subscription to, but at some 
point, tomato soup and barre start to feel rigid. We crave 
softness and ease because we want what we can’t have, or 
what we think we never could be.
We don’t want to quantify or compete, we just want to 
flow. So we go to yoga. And we look at our friend, who 
smiles through his sweat as he beams his body down 
with candor, not worried about grace or failure, and 
we’re envious and heartbroken over the years we spent 
struggling with both.
I 

want a perfect body / I want a perfect soul,” 
(“Creep,” Radiohead).
Perfection is overrated, and that’s a hard 
conclusion to come to. It’s hard to spend years and 
money trying to make your body the best, only to realize 

that you’re only ever going to get 
better. It’s hard to get so warped by the 
world of wellness that you can’t stop 
subscribing to it, even when you’re 
about to die. It’s hard to return to the 
person you were before you entered 
this world because she’s gone, and 
you’ve got a workout at seven.
We see a result and we want more. 
We see a new result and we want them 
all. With progress comes obsession, 
and 
everyone’s 
obsessed 
with 
something. So, we go to the workout — 
be it to get perfect or better or even just 
a little bit closer to fine, as the Indigo 
Girls would say.
M

y most recent visit to Pure 
Barre was tough. I didn’t 
want to go, but the $15 
cancellation fee was too bitter to bite. 
My favorite instructor took us through 
all my least favorite postures: We 
hovered our thighs an inch above our 
ankles and circled our hips, we dipped 
our hips side to side in a forearm plank.
But I’m tough, too, and I circled and 
dipped until the end of class, when 
I settled on my back, drinking in our 
stretch like water. I put my hands on 
my stomach, making a point to exhale. 
I let my flesh jut out to round the band 
on my leggings, let myself be soft, let 
myself just be. 
Curling into a ball and rolling up, 
I straddled my legs beside me and 
leaned into each one, heart to ceiling, 
heart to floor. The same woman who 
just made me pulse like a chump in a 
wall-sit against the barre knelt behind 
me, massaging my muscles. She pushed 
me further into each knee, further into 
myself. I moved to the center, crawling 
my torso in front of me, reaching for 
the front mirror as her tattooed hands 
lowered me into the carpet.
I sat up and pulled my legs together, 
reaching for my ankles, my toes. I 
inhaled, my deepest of the day, and 
then I let go.

n the universe of college student 
organizations 
and 
meetings, 
icebreakers are a necessary evil 
— universally hated, yet they persist in 
a futile attempt to personalize meet-
ings beyond the generic name/year/
pronouns/major 
introductions. 
At 
their best, icebreakers provide a tiny, 
mostly insignificant insight into the 
tastes and preferences of the people 
around you. At their worst, they tend 
to feel like a forced game with no real 
objective — a bunch of young adults 
sitting around naming obscure colors, 
their favorite ice cream flavor or the 
direction they face while they shower 
(I particularly despise this one). Who 
wins this game? Don’t we all lose, in 
our inevitably-doomed efforts 
to sum up the complexity of 
existence with a few careful-
ly-chosen words?
Of all the icebreakers I feel 
strongly about, the one I hate 
the least is: What’s the cool-
est thing you’ve done in the 
shoes you’re wearing? It has 
several 
redeeming 
factors. 
You can’t answer in a single 
word, there’s no default vanil-
la ice cream answer and, most 
importantly, you ideally learn 
something about what the per-
son answering deems “cool.”
Plus, there’s the added ben-
efit that I’m usually wearing 
my brown Blundstone boots 
whenever 
this 
question 
is 
asked. This allows me to tell 
the story of the time I went 
to a “very cool” drag bar in 
an underground warehouse 
in Berlin with a friend I’d just 
met while wearing said boots, 
and 
casually 
established 
myself as a worldly, cosmopol-
itan individual.
I’ve told the Berlin story many times, 
each time adding in a new detail: the 
jungle-themed karaoke room, the spon-
taneous game of limbo with a feather 
boa, the saxophone player I befriended 
on the 5 a.m. metro back to the hostel. 
The story’s become an animal of its own, 
an opus to a free-spirited, Europe-roam-
ing character.
Which is why it pains me now to admit 
that the Berlin warehouse drag bar story 
might be just a wee bit disingenuous, 
in terms of how it represents me as an 
individual. It is a “very cool” story, this 
is true. It did also really happen. But it 
makes up a small percentage of the time 
my feet have spent in these boots.
Truth be told, since I got the boots as 
a Hanukkah present two years ago, the 
vast majority of their showtime has been 

not in Berlin drag bars, but on the side-
walks of Ann Arbor. They have trudged 
the blocks from my junior year apart-
ment to Mason Hall. They have pounded 
out the path between my senior year 
home and Espresso Royale, my yoga stu-
dio and friends’ houses. 
I’ve gotten to know the particular 
quirks of the Ann Arbor sidewalks — the 
tufts of grass poking up between the 
cracks, dips in the concrete that tend to 
flood when the snow melts, the spot on 
State Street near Huron where you have 
to tread carefully as it’s usually littered 
with broken glass shards.
The Ann Arbor sidewalks have gotten 
to know me as well. They’ve heard the 
conversations between my roommate 

and me as we walk to class, loudly airing 
our complaints about the world for every 
square of pavement to hear. The side-
walks have witnessed my panicked fast-
walking when I’m running late to work, 
swearing out loud and promising myself 
I’ll never make the mistake of starting 
the grilled-cheese-making process so 
close to my clock-in time again. They’ve 
generously said nothing when I plug in 
my earbuds and listen to the same Bright 
Eyes album for the third time in one day, 
only looked on in stoic, concerned, con-
crete silence. 
I usually call my parents when I’m 
walking somewhere. The 10 or 15-min-
ute walk provides the perfect opportu-
nity to catch up and the perfect excuse 
to promptly hang up: “Can’t talk about 
my post-grad plans right now, I’m at 

class, have to go, talk later, yes, love you 
too, bye now!” But the walk also proves 
the ideal place to talk freely and honest-
ly — the sidewalks offer a certain type of 
privacy difficult to come by on a college 
campus.
Freshman year, sharing a tiny South 
Quad Residence Hall dorm room, the 
sidewalk was often the only place I 
could truly be by myself, in ten-minute 
gaps in a calendar crammed with class-
es and extracurriculars. Even later on 
in college, when I finally moved to my 
own room, there’s still more often than 
not housemates lingering in common 
spaces and familiar faces to run into at 
the library and coffee shops. They are 
people I love dearly and value immense-

ly, but the overall effect can be suffocat-
ing. Time to just exist in college, without 
controlling the image you present to the 
community, is elusive.
On the pavement of the sidewalks, 
I’m in full view of the world, yet in 
a private enough space I can tell my 
mom about the particularly rough day 
I’ve had, maybe even shed a tear if I 
need to. I’ll pass by others, of course, 
but they’re all concerned with their 
own conversations, podcasts or playl-
ists. The sidewalk is comforting in its 
impassiveness, its utilitarianism, its 
anonymity.
Occasionally, instead of calling up my 
mom or plugging in a podcast, I’ll make 
the daring decision to brave the walk to 
class distraction-free — no earbuds, no 
walking partner. As I trod the sidewalks, 

I’ll muse over a problem or distraction, 
bouncing my thoughts and theories off 
the concrete. “No,” the sidewalks will 
say, “you shouldn’t text that person. 
You should find validation through 
yourself.” Or “yes,” the sidewalks will 
say, “you should apply for that job,” and 
I’ll realize I’m self-sabotaging yet again. 
You should just go for the thing, damn it, 
Meghann.
The sidewalks are pretty much the 
only space in Ann Arbor where I can 
have these conversations with myself, 
where nothing pressing pulls at my 
attention — I’m not going to be doing 
my reading for class while walking, or 
applying to job positions on LinkedIn. 
The freedom from these distractions 
and obligations is desperately 
needed — a space where I have 
no obligation to be productive 
or sociable for the world.
Due to the University of 
Michigan’s size, I’ve spent a 
fair amount of time with the 
sidewalks as my companion. 
On an average day, I’ll spend at 
minimum an hour in transit on 
the city sidewalks. I must have 
walked hundreds of miles by 
now on their paved surfaces, 
chronicling joy and heartbreak 
and love on the trek to the 
UGLi, No Thai or the CCRB. 
The sidewalks of Ann Arbor 
witnessed me at my worst and 
loneliest, walking home late at 
night from the library, brim-
ming with self-pity during the 
winter months of sophomore 
year when it felt that everyone 
around me had found their for-
ever people except for me. Two 
years later, I tread those same 
squares of pavement on my way 
to brunch with friends that had 
been there since freshman year 
— it just took some more hours walking 
these sidewalks to come to this conclu-
sion.
So here’s to the sidewalks of Ann 
Arbor, in all their salt-scored, crowd-
trodden glory. These sidewalks certain-
ly do not make for as good of a story as 
a Berlin nightclub, this is true — and I 
will, therefore, most definitely continue 
to tell my Berlin nightclub story when-
ever said icebreaker is proposed. But, 
when it comes down to it, I’ve left more 
of me on the pavement of these streets 
than I have in any club. So this is an ode 
to the concrete squares that have been 
my loyal companions — or, perhaps more 
aptly, to the person that’s walked and 
cried and laughed and grown on these 
sidewalks of Ann Arbor these past four 
years.
