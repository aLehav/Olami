Study finds shock therapy 
viable depression treatment

Despite stigma, 
ECT found to be 
cost-effective 

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

Electroconvulsive therapy, also 
known as ECT or shock therapy, 
may serve as a cost-effective 
treatment for depression after 
two 
other 
interventions 
have 
failed, according to a University of 
Michigan study published May 9 
this year.
ECT is a 15- to 20-minute 
procedure in which the patient is 
placed under light anesthesia and 
an electric stimulus is delivered to 
electrodes attached to the patient’s 
scalp. Common diagnoses treated 
by ECT include depression, bipolar 
disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, 
catatonia and epilepsy. Michigan 
Medicine opened a new facility 
dedicated to ECT in 2016, which 
now treats about 150 to 200 patients 
a year, totaling about 3,000 ECT 

procedures annually, said Daniel 
Maixner, a psychology associate 
professor and co-author of the study.
Maixner administers ECT to 
patients ranging from their teens 
to nearly 100 years old. He said 
ECT often yields positive results 
in severely depressed patients 
because, simply put, the procedure 
“resets” neural pathways by causing 
between 20 and 60 seconds of 
hyperactivity in the brain.
“It’s not really rewiring, but it 
could be calming circuits that are 
stuck on,” Maixner said. “There’s 
some evidence that the circuitry 
gets stuck with depression, and 
patients describe it that way too.”
Psychology associate professor 
Neera 
Ghaziuddin, 
who 
also 
administers ECT, said electrical 
stimulation can alter many of the 
different physiological pathways 
associated 
with 
depression. 
The procedure normalizes the 
hypothalamic 
pituitary 
adrenal 
access, 
which 
controls 
stress 
response, and regulates the release 
of neurotransmitters. In addition, 
ECT thickens the linings of blood 

cells, increases blood infusion to 
the brain, ups the production of 
proteins that affect neurons and 
controls the transcription of genes 
involved in depression. According to 
Ghaziuddin, ECT treats depression 
through more mechanisms than 
antidepressant medication.
Physicians 
recommend 
ECT 
to depressed patients based on 
two main factors, resistance to 
treatment and severity of illness, 
where severity generally takes 
precedence. Maixner said like 
any 
treatment, 
ECT 
becomes 
less effective the longer a patient 
has been suffering. In the study 
published May 9, Maixner and his 
colleagues investigated when in 
the course of a patient’s illness ECT 
should be considered. The team 
used an analytic model to perform 
a cost-benefit analysis of ECT, 
considering the quality-adjusted 
life-years, or relatively happy and 
healthy years, that patients gain 
from the procedure.

Radio analyst
resigns amidst
allegations

Jack Lessenberry 
accused of sexual 
harassment by 
former students 

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

Jack Lessenberry, a journalism 
professor at Wayne State University 
and political analyst for Michigan 
Radio, has resigned from his positions 
amid sexual harassment allegations.
Penny Bowler, a former WSU 
student quoted in the Deadline Detroit 
article that originally broke the story, 
claimed Lessenberry offered a ride 
home in 2006 and 2007 and inquired 
if she had a boyfriend. Bowler did not.
According to Bowler, Lessenberry 
proceeded to tell her some students 
are willing to “do anything to get 
an A” and touched her without her 
consent.
According to an article from The 
Detroit News, Lessenberry is accused 
of making inappropriate comments 
and 
attention 
toward 
women 
while employed as an editor at the 
Commercial Appeal newspaper in 
Minneapolis and as a WSU professor.
The 
original 
Deadline 
Detroit 
article also reported that 14 women 
have come forward with allegations 
against Lessenberry, occurring over 
about a 30-year period, including 
forced kissing and inquiries about 
past and current romantic partners.
Lessenberry 
has 
previously 
written 
articles 
for 
Michigan 
Radio denouncing Michigan State 
University’s handling of the Larry 
Nassar sexual abuse scandal.
In an article with the headline 
“Michigan 
State 
needs 
cultural, 
systemic change,” Lessenberry wrote 
about what he felt was a narrow-
minded 
culture 
regarding 
the 
scandal.

U-M responds to 
free speech lawsuit

‘U’ argues programs 
and policies are 
misrepresented

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

Amid a federal lawsuit filed by the 
organization Speech First against 
the University of Michigan’s Bias 
Response Team, the University has 
responded, claiming the lawsuit has 
mischaracterized University policies 
and programs.
Speech First, a group composed of 
students, alumni and citizen free speech 
advocates, is suing the University, 
claiming the University has violated 
the right to free speech given in the U.S. 
Constitution. 
When asked for comment on the 
lawsuit, University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald referred to a statement 
released on behalf of the University in 
the University Record.
“In Wednesday’s court filing, the 
University argues that the lawsuit has 
mischaracterized university policies 
and programs and ‘how they have been 

applied and has painted a picture of the 
university that does not reflect the true 
vibrancy of debate and discussion on 
campus,’” the statement reads.
The statement goes on to explain 
the policies and programs reaffirm free 
speech a core principle at the University. 
“The University’s Standard Practice 
Guide 
reaffirms 
the 
university’s 
commitment to free speech,” the 
statement reads. “It states, in part, that 
‘expression of diverse points of view is 
of the highest importance, not only for 
those who espouse a cause or position 
and then defend it, but also for those 
who hear and pass judgment on that 
defense. The belief that an opinion is 
pernicious, false, or in any other way 
detestable cannot be grounds for its 
suppression. Freedom of speech is a 
bedrock principle at U-M. Commitment 
to this principle is reflected in the 
history, the policies, and the practices 
of the university. Students, faculty and 
staff regularly hear and meet a wide 
range of speakers who bring diverse 
viewpoints and perspectives to the 
Ann Arbor campus.’”

Robotic exoskeleton 
could enhance 
human abilities

By ELIZABETH LAWRENCE

Daily Staff Reporter

 
The University of Michigan’s 
STARX 
team, 
a 
three-
year-old 
group 
that 
builds 
strength-augmenting 
robotic 
suits 
— 
otherwise 
known 
as 
exoskeletons 
— 
hosted 
the first Applied Collegiate 
Exoskeleton competition this 
year. Founder Kevin Rabideau, 
a 2016 U-M alum, has always 
been fascinated by this use of 
technology.
“I just think it’s a cool and 
exciting thing,” Rabideau said. 
“You’re using machines to make 
people run faster and lift more 
weights and reduce strain. It 
feels very science-fictiony and 
exciting to have something that 
can make you run faster than 
other people.”
At ACE, students who share 
Rabideau’s 
enthusiasm 
for 
exoskeletons came together to 
share their hard work. Along 
with the University, teams from 
Michigan 
State 
University, 
University of Nebraska Omaha, 
Colorado 
School 
of 
Mines 
and 
Iowa 
State 
University 
participated in the competition.
ACE consisted of a design 

review, an endurance test and 
an obstacle course based on 
tests firefighters must complete. 
STARX 
President 
Declan 
Winship, an Engineering senior, 
said 
strength-augmenting 
exoskeletons have a tremendous 
number of applications, but 
ACE’s focus was on search and 
rescue.
“Our specific application on 
the team is search and rescue 
because a firefighter carries 
very heavy equipment and, in 
some cases, has to carry a person 
out of a burning building,” 
Winship said. “We believe that 
if we can get search-and-rescue 
people to where they need to be, 
making them less tired in the 
process, they can make better 
decisions and be better able 
to react if things suddenly get 
more dangerous.”
Beyond 
increasing 
human 
strength, 
exoskeletons 
can 
also be rehabilitative, helping 
people with paralysis or muscle 
weakness 
attain 
mobility. 
Robotics Director Jessy Grizzle, 
an 
electrical 
and 
computer 
engineering 
professor, 
said 
while 
exoskeletons 
are 
becoming more sophisticated, 
they are still limited, making 
the students’ efforts at ACE that 
much more impressive.

New dispensary in AA

Licensing changes 
allow for new 
marijuana facility

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

Amid a new Michigan licens-

ing act and an updated Ann 

Arbor ordinance, a new mari-

juana dispensary has opened 

near the University of Michi-

gan’s campus. Green Planet 

dispenses medical marijuana 

to registered patients and is 

located at 700 Tappan Ave., 

across from the Ross School of 

Business and the Law Quad-

rangle.

Green Planet is one of many 

new dispensaries opening in 

the Ann Arbor area after the 

legal changes put into effect 

earlier this year.

According to its website, the 

dispensary is part of a non-

profit group aiming to assist 

medical 
marijuana 
patients 

and share information about 

marijuana’s medical benefits.

Medical 
marijuana 
usage 

has 
garnered 
recent 
con-

troversy 
regarding 
addic-

tion potential and regulation 

among government officials 

and the media in recent years. 

However, some sources state 

medicinal marijuana can help 

treat different forms of cancer, 

mental illness and more. The 

drug has not yet been approved 

for use by the Food and Drug 

Administration.

City 
Planning 
Manager 

Brett Lenart told The Michi-

gan Daily the dispensary met 

the requirements for approval.

“The 
Planning 
Commis-

sion did find that 700 Tappan 

Ave met the requirements set 

forth by City Ordinance, and 

recommended approval of a 

Special Exception Use Per-

mit,” Lenart wrote in an email 

interview. “As part of the con-

ditions of approval, the appli-

cant will need to close the 

vehicular curb cut, which will 

reduce one instance of poten-

tial pedestrian/vehicular con-

flicts.The applicant still has to 

demonstrate compliance with 

building codes, and needs to 

apply for and receive operating 

permit and license from the 

City Clerk and State of Michi-

gan.”

Green Planet Director Mike 

McLeod felt Ann Arbor was 

the obvious choice to open 

the dispensary because of the 

city’s leadership in science, 

knowledge, medicine and can-

nabis. Many of Green Planet’s 

workers are U-M alumni.

“Green Planet is passion-

ate about medical cannabis,” 

McLeod wrote in an email 

interview. “We provide our 

patients with the best ser-

vice and quality of medicine 

available. Green Planet has 

the most knowledgeable and 

experienced staff in our indus-

try, many of whom are U of 

M grads including graduate 

degrees from the School of 

Public Health and Pharmacol-

ogy.”

City Councilmember Chuck 

Warpehoski, 
D-Ward 
5, 

explained dispensaries in the 

city have certain regulations 

they must follow in order to 

operate, such as designated 

locations and proximity to 

other dispensaries. He also 

said the city has a history of 

supporting marijuana usage.

“Ann Arbor has long been 

a town that has been tolerant 

and supportive of marijuana 

use,” Warpehoski said. “With 

the state putting forward reg-

ulations that allow for a clear 

pathway for opening dispen-

saries, there has been a huge 

uptick of interest.”

According to Warpehoski, 

the city has not received any 

recent complaints regarding 

dispensaries.

A ballot proposal to be voted 

on in November could legal-

ize marijuana usage across 

the state of Michigan, which 

Warpehoski 
believes 
could 

assist 
law 
enforcement. 
If 

passed, the law would make 

possession and sale of marijua-

na up to 2.5 ounces legal and 

impose a 10-percent excise and 

6-percent sales tax on retail 

purchases.

“I believe there would be a 

huge relief on our criminal jus-

tice system,” Warpehoski said. 

“It would be a significantly 

positive thing to address the 

problem of mass incarcera-

tion.”

U-M, Shanghai ‘U’ renew partnership

By ROB DALKA

For The Daily 

The University of Michigan 
and Shanghai Jiao Tong Univer-
sity have renewed their support 
of the Joint Institute, signing 
another 10-year agreement and 
dedicating a new building to the 
institute.
The UM-SJTU Joint Insti-
tute, located in Shanghai, began 
in 2006 with the goal to build 
a 
world-class 
teaching 
and 
research institute in China and 
to nurture innovative leaders 
with a global perspective. It was 
born out of faculty exchanges 
and 
research 
collaborations 
between the University and 
SJTU led by Professor Jun Ni, an 
alum of SJTU and current U-M 
professor of engineering and 
Shien-Ming (Sam) Wu professor 
of manufacturing science. 
Pamela Byrnes, U.S. director 
of the UM-SJTU Joint Institute, 
feels Ni strived greatly to make 
the Institute a success.
“Professor 
Jun 
Ni 
went 
out to recruit faculty and stu-
dents,” Byrnes said. “He worked 
between both institutions, the 
SJTU and the University of 
Michigan, to help make this a 
realization.”
In 2014, the institute was 
awarded the Andrew Heiskell 
Award for Innovation in Higher 
Education from the Institute of 
International Education, one of 
the most prestigious awards in 
international education.
Currently, students from 17 
countries attend the Joint Insti-
tute for full-time degree pro-
grams and short-term exchange 
programs. The curriculum is 
modeled on curriculum at the 
University of Michigan and 
many U-M students elect to 
attend the Joint Institute as a 
part of a study abroad program.
In collaboration with the Uni-
versity of Michigan, the Joint 
Institute offers a dual-degree 
program. Through this pro-
gram, students spend their first 
two years at the Joint Institute 
in Shanghai. The final two years 
are spent at the University of 

Michigan, where the students 
earn their bachelor’s degree in 
one of 15 majors through the 
College of Engineering, or in 
math or physics through LSA. 
After the completion of a U-M 
bachelor’s degree, the students 
then return to SJTU to complete 
the 
remaining 
requirements, 
ultimately earning two degrees, 
one each from U-M and SJTU.
“The Joint Institute is a great 
way for people from very differ-
ent cultures to get to know each 
other, understand the cultures 
and be able to work globally 
on global issues,” Byrnes said. 
“There are all sorts of different 
avenues of connections for these 
students.”
A new program, the Global 

Degree Pathway, became for-
malized with the new 10-year 
agreement. This program gives 
all students who complete a 
bachelor’s degree at the Joint 
Institute a chance to pursue a 
master’s degree in a variety of 
disciplines at the University of 
Michigan and other internation-
al institutions.
Amy Conger, assistant vice 
provost of global and engaged 
education, said the Institute is 
striving to make the program 
better each year.

“We learned very much from 
the success of the dual-degree 
program, and going into the 
Joint Institute’s second decade, 
we are trying to envision what 
JI graduates need at this time,” 
Conger said. “More and more 
we are seeing deep value in the 
combination of an undergradu-
ate degree in an engineering 
discipline plus a graduate degree 
from an international institution 
in either engineering or a com-
plementary field.”
There are currently multiple 
graduate programs at the Uni-
versity of Michigan that will be 
offered through the GDP, includ-
ing programs in the College 
of Engineering, the School of 
Information and the Ross School 
of Business.
“Undergraduate 
students 
now can take advantage of some 
of the pathways, and we are 
working very quickly to build 
additional degree options with 
different international institu-
tions,” Conger said.
Along 
with 
the 
renewed 
agreement, a new building has 
been dedicated to the Joint 
Institute. The Long Bin Building 
in Shanghai is named after the 
parents of John Wu, a U-M alum 
who in 2015 donated $10 million 
to support the Joint Institute.
This building is home to all of 
the operations of the Joint Insti-
tute and is another step in its 
evolution.
“The building has many dif-
ferent discussion areas, lounges 
and laboratories for research,” 
Byrnes said. “It will be a huge 
center for student activity.”
University President Mark 
Schlissel expressed his support 
for the renewed agreement in an 
article published by the Univer-
sity Record.
“The Shanghai Jiao Tong Uni-
versity collaboration is U-M’s 
largest and most comprehensive 
partnership in China,” Schlissel 
said. “It has given hundreds of 
students from both our nations 
the opportunity to pursue excel-
lent academic programs and 
conduct research. We have also 
fostered more than a decade of 
research interactions among fac-
ulty. I am further excited by the 
possibilities as we extend and 
enhance our partnership.”

Edited and managed by students at 
the University of Michigan since 1890.

I

n 2016, it was estimated that opioid 
overdoses killed more Americans 
than the Vietnam and Iraq wars 
combined.
The 
Michigan-OPEN 
website 
which keeps track of roughly how 
many opioid-related deaths occur each 
day. At the time of writing this column, 
the number stands at 115.
With hundreds of Michiganders 
dying of opioid overdose every week, 
you would think the state and local 
governments would have a pretty 
good handle on addressing this 
devastating public health crisis. While 
there are some effective government 
interventions 
available 
to 
help 
Michiganders struggling with opioid 
addiction, these efforts are not enough 
and the patchwork of policies and 
institutions to address opioid addiction 
is a mess to navigate.
I have an internship at Workit 
Health this summer, a telehealth 
program that provides treatment for 
opioid addiction. Recently, our clinical 
operations manager and I sought to 
find a source of free naloxone kits 
for patients. Naloxone (brand name: 
Narcan) can reverse an opioid overdose 
and save someone’s life. It is available 
without a prescription at places like 
CVS Pharmacy; however, the cost 
of a Narcan kit for someone without 
health insurance is almost $100. In the 
emergency situation of an overdose, 
forcing a person’s friends or family to 
fork over $100 they may not have is 
both impractical and cruel. Access to 
free or reduced-cost naloxone kits is not 
only benevolent, but also makes fiscal 
sense. According to a White House-
commissioned report, the estimated 

cost of overdose deaths in 2015 was 
$431.7 billion. That comes out to be 
about $30,000 per death by overdose 
shouldered by taxpayers. But what did 
we find when we went in search of free 
affordable naloxone kits for those at 
incredible risk for death by overdose? A 
lot of headache and no naloxone.
First, we called the Washtenaw 
County Health Department and the 
Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office. 
They told us there was a service to 
provide a free naloxone kit to those 
who survived an overdose but not for 
people who have yet to overdose. So 
much for prevention.
Then, 
we 
called 
our 
state 
representative’s office to see if their 
constituent services desk knew about 
the resource. The person on the line 
did not know any places to find free 
or reduced-cost naloxone kits but said 
they would look into it for us and call 
back. The staffer called back soon after, 
giving us two numbers we could call. 
We were excited to be on the right track 
— that is, until we called both numbers. 
They were disconnected.
Last summer, I experienced another 
side of Michigan’s attempts to combat 
opioid addiction as a pharmacy 
technician at an independent pharmacy 
in Detroit. Towards the end of my time 
there, Michigan State Police raided the 
clinic of doctor Mohammad Durrani 
in Dearborn because he prescribed 
more than 500,000 pain pills between 
January and August 2017. The bust 
spooked the physician in the clinic 
attached to the pharmacy in which I 
worked. In a panic, the physician began 
to only write prescriptions for a seven-
day supply of opioids and a referral to a 

pain management specialist regardless 
of circumstance. This physician had 
no real reason to be afraid of law 
enforcement or of losing his license, but 
his patients suffered, as they lamented 
to us at the pharmacy, because of 
their provider’s unnecessary, but 
understandable, panic.
I — and many people more educated 
and experienced in addiction care—
worry that coming down hard on 
prescribers of opioids will limit the 
flow of pain pills to patients who 
might genuinely need them and risks 
needless suffering for patients. This 
may also push people from pain pills 
to heroin, which is much cheaper and 
easily accessible illicitly. Yes, opioids 
have been over-prescribed (there are 
more opioid prescriptions in Michigan 
than people). However, indiscriminately 
restricting access to opioids is not the 
answer. Medicine has come a long way 
in recognizing how to safely use pain 
pills and patients who need them should 
not be denied pain relief.
Michigan 
communities 
have 
been devastated by addiction to pain 
pills and heroin. At the very least, 
state government should create a 
central, 
well-advertised 
directory 
for Michiganders looking to locate 
resources like affordable naloxone kits. 
State policymakers should also explore 
policy to encourage more clinicians to 
treat addiction with buprenorphine 
and ensure that clinicians who are 
prescribing opioids properly are not 
afraid of arrest or loss of license.

A

s spring gives way to 
summer, 
first-round 
campaigning has given 
way 
to 
primary 
elections, 
which will soon give way to 
final 
elections 
in 
November. 
 
Significantly low levels of voter 
turnout in midterm elections and 
among the American electorate 
in general mean every vote will 
count. 
Over 6 million Americans, 
however, 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
excluded from this influential 
swath of voters because of felony 
convictions, with many states 
offering 
felons 
little 
chance 
to actually regain the right 
to 
vote 
after 
imprisonment. 
This exclusion occurs across 
a surprising majority of U.S. 
states, signaling a consensus 
that has impinged on American 
democracy for long enough. It is 
time to categorically restore the 
right to vote among felons who 
have served their time.
Denying ex-felons the right to 
vote may seem like a reasonable 
measure, but at its core, it is 
nothing less than an assault 
on the backbone of democracy. 
The practice most notably came 
into prominence in the South 
following 
Reconstruction. 
During this time, Southern states, 
eager to return their legislatures 
to a state of white dominance, set 
about finding ways to eliminate 
African-American votes. Felon 
disenfranchisement 
statutes 
succeeded at reducing African-
American 
voter 
registration 
relative 
to 
white 
voter 
registration in the South, taking 
advantage of higher conviction 
rates among African-American 
people for many crimes. 
Beyond its role in subjugating 
African-American 
people 
to 
the laws of Jim Crow for most 
of 
the 
20th 
century, 
felon 
disenfranchisement has damaged 
America’s democratic foundation 
by denying many citizens a voice 
in choosing our leaders.
In 
2018, 
generations 
after 
voting discrimination by race and 
by gender have been defeated, 
it is easy to take suffrage for 
granted. As citizens, however, 
we must not forget that voting is 
the preeminent method by which 
citizenship is exercised. Without 
suffrage, the power of the people 
to choose their leaders – the 
very dynamic that underpins 
representative 
democracy 
– 
ceases to exist. 

It follows that the extension 
of suffrage to more citizens 
serves to better the government’s 
representation of the people, 
preserving 
the 
essence 
of 
representative rule. We do not 
vote because we are citizens; we 
are citizens because we can vote.
As long as this system of 
government for and by the people 
rests on the right to vote, voting 
must be upheld as a fundamental 
right. That is why voting, though 
not explicitly mentioned in the 
Bill of Rights, is constitutionally 
protected. It is also why 
restrictions on who can vote 
have recently been narrowed 
to exclude only those incapable 
of full legal capacity – that is, 
minors, convicted criminals and 
the mentally incapacitated. 

The 
continued 
application 
of voting restrictions to former 
convicts, however, invokes a 
moral argument contradictory 
to this established reverence for 
voting. Allowing states to bar 
ex-felons from voting because 
 
those unwilling to follow the law 
shouldn’t make the law, fails to 
establish a strong relationship 
between a legitimate state interest 
and the disenfranchisement of a 
narrowly tailored group.
This failure becomes apparent 
when inspecting the relationship 
between, 
say, 
the 
legitimate 
state 
interest 
of 
reducing 
violent criminal activity and 
the commonplace restriction on 
firearm ownership by ex-felons. 
Convicted violent criminals are 
more inclined to use weapons 
for criminal purposes in the 
future, so in this case, they must 
yield their Second Amendment 
protections to the valid state

“Over 6 million

this influential 
swath of voters.


A 

month ago, University 
of 
Michigan 
Jewish 
leadership organization 
Hillel was celebrating Israel 
on the Diag with flags and a 
photo booth cutout of Israelis 
riding 
a 
camel. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
past 
few 
weeks 
have 
been a time of suffering and 
remembrance 
for 
Palestine 
and its diaspora as it reflects 
on the 70th anniversary of “Al 
Nakba,” or “The Catastrophe” 
in Arabic. Al Nakba was the 
exodus of more than 700,000 
Palestinians from their family 
homes and land to neighboring 
countries where many of them 
still live as refugees today. 
On May 14, under President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
directive, 
the 
United 
States 
officially 
opened its embassy to Israel in 
Jerusalem, recognizing the city 
as capital of Israel. Moving the 
Israeli capital has been a point 
of contention as the gesture 
seals Israeli sovereignty in the 
contested city of Jerusalem. In 
response, tens of thousands of 
Palestinians attempted to cross 
the fence separating Gaza from 
Israel. In typical Israel Defense 
Forces fashion, the Palestinians 
were met with gunshots and 
tear gas resulting in 58 dead and 
more than 2,700 injured. 
Scrolling 
through 
social 
media over the past week, I’ve 
seen a mixture of reactions to 
the current situation in Israel 
and Palestine. Many of the 
strong, 
passionate 
activists 
I know on campus have been 
going out of their way to support 
Palestinians via social media 
by sharing articles and raising 
money for relief funds. Others in 
my social network have reacted 
differently, 
sharing 
articles 
and long posts about the bias 
against Israel, particularly in 
the media, and casting them as 
the victim in this situation. I 
can’t help but find these claims 
of bias against Israel ridiculous. 
Israel has always, and will 
probably continue to, receive 
blind support from much of the 
Western world – particularly 
its media – and it benefits from 
too much systemic power to be 
considered a victim in this case.
There has been a worldwide 
favorable bias for Israel since a 
little over a century ago when 
Britain released the Balfour 
Declaration 
proclaiming 

support for the concept of a 
Jewish 
state 
in 
Mandatory 
Palestine. In 1947, Britain ended 
the 
declaration 
and 
pushed 
the Palestine debate to the 
international community. With 
the passage of United Nations 
Resolution 181 by a two-thirds 
majority, the global community 
solidified its support for Israel 
and its people by giving over 
half of Mandatory Palestine 
to Israel despite the fact that 
Israel’s population was a third 
of that of Palestine. As time has 
gone by, the United States in 
particular has shown unyielding 
support for Israel time and 
again. No country has received 
more economic or military aid 
from the United States than 
Israel since 1976. 

The media is certainly not 
biased against Israel. Much of 
U.S. media today, both liberal 
and conservative, is considered 
to be largely in favor of Israel. 
According to “The Israel Lobby 
and U.S. Foreign Policy” by John 
J. Mearsheimer and Stephen 
Walt, news sources like the Wall 
Street Journal predictably lean 
pro-Israel, but so do the liberal 
bastions 
of 
reporting 
such 
as the Washington Post and 
the New York Times. Despite 
this, 
the 
New 
York 
Times, 
Washington Post, and even Wall 
Street Journal have reported 
on the protests and Palestinian 
casualties despite these inherent 
biases. If even news sources that 
are considered part of the Israel 
Lobby are making out Israel to 
be the party at fault then that 
says something, and it’s not due 
to a bias against Israel.
All of this global support 
plays into the power imbalance 
between Israel and Palestine 
that makes it impossible for 

Israel to be the victim in this 
circumstance. The protests of 
tens of thousands of Gazans 
trapped behind a fence and a 
multitude 
of 
blockades 
may 
not 
have 
been 
completely 
peaceful, but they were more 
than justified. Gazans protested 
using burning kites while the 
Israeli 
military 
responded 
with rifles, snipers and tear 
gas. Of the more than 2,700 
protesters 
injured, 
at 
least 
half of the injuries were due to 
gunshot wounds. Among the 58 
Palestinians murdered in the 
Gaza protests were teenagers 
and a baby girl; 8-month-old 
Layla Ghandour died Monday 
after inhaling large amounts 
of tear gas. Palestinians simply 
do not hold enough political or 
military power to be the villains 
in this situation.
When living on a liberal 
college campus full of clubs 
and activists drawing attention 
to important and controversial 
political issues like the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, it can be 
easy to lose perspective on these 
issues. While the pro-Palestine 
community may be significant 
on campus, this is simply not 
the case in a country where 
the 
president 
declares 
the 
international city of Jerusalem 
the sole capital of Israel. It is 
important to remember that 
outside the bubble of university 
life, the government and media 
are still strongly in support of 
Israel and Palestinians continue 
to suffer due to that fact.
However, 
there 
are 
ways 
to 
influence 
the 
situation 
outside 
of 
Ann 
Arbor. 
An 
easy start is sharing articles 
and keeping people in your 
network aware of the injustices 
Palestinians endure every day. 
There are also plenty of relief 
funds that donate food and 
medical supplies to Palestine. 
However, if we want to see 
long term changes in the state 
of Palestine, it will take more 
than that. In order to change 
the way the United States 
treats Israel, we must be more 
conscious about not voting for 
politicians who are supported 
by the Israel lobby and pressure 
the government to stand up 
against Israel’s human rights 
violations.

interest 
of 
the 
public’s 
physical 
safety. 
However, 
no 
similar 
rationale 
exists 
between 
voting 
disenfranchisement 
of 
ex-felons and the sacred right 
to vote.
This is not to say that other 
exclusions from voting-rights 
protection are invalid. Minors 
and the mentally incapacitated 
are also excluded from these 
protections, just as they are 
unable to independently sue or 
enter into contracts, because 
they are considered to lack 
the requisite mental capacity. 
Such 
voting 
restrictions 
meet the strict criteria for 
encroachment on fundamental 
rights, because they exclude a 
particular group based on their 
incapacity to comprehend their 
own best interests. Acting in 
the name of self-interest, after 
all, is central to the voting 
process. 
In contrast, while it may 
be tempting to use the moral 
failures 
of 
ex-felons 
to 
justify a reduction in their 
public 
participation, 
their 
classification 
as 
a 
group 
is not based on a question 
of mental capacity. Their 
disenfranchisement 
is 
therefore incongruent with 
the other provisions Congress 
has made for restrictions on 
suffrage.
There 
are 
recognized 
state interests served by the 
imprisonment of felons. It is 
punitive. It restricts ex-felons’ 
autonomy and protects society. 
Additionally, it deters criminal 
action by would-be felons. 
These justifications, however, 
only hold up as long as a felon 
is still serving their sentence. 
After release from prison and 
completion of parole, a felon 
has fulfilled the punishment 
deemed proportionate to their 
crime, and the need to protect 

others from their behavior has 
accordingly been reduced or 
eliminated. At this point, any 
semblance of legitimate state 
interest is outweighed by the 
demonstrated need to extend 
and preserve suffrage.
The 
right 
to 
vote 
has 
not always been received 
as 
sacred 
throughout 
America’s 
long 
history, 
just as “We the People” 
has not always included all 
peoples. Bitter struggles to 
extend the franchise to all 
qualified Americans shows 
the power of voting and 
the justice achieved when 
more citizens are able to 
take part in selecting their 
representatives. 
The last episode in this long 
crusade is the holdover of felon 
disenfranchisement from an 
era of unscrupulous political 
motivations 
and 
severely 
entrenched 
inequality. 
Disenfranchisement 
of 
ex-felons 
has 
proved 
damaging 
to 
the 
ideals 
of 
American 
democracy, 
carving out exceptions to the 
electorate without adequate 
justification.
Voting is a right that must 
be afforded the protections 
provided to other crucial 
institutions, such as speech 
and privacy. Allowing states 
to nullify the natural-born 
right to vote for millions of 
Americans beyond repayment 
of their debts to society 
neither meets the standards 
for disenfranchisement nor 
serves the legitimate interests 
of the public. As such, it is 
time to amend suffrage to 
include all capable citizens, 
regardless of past criminal 
convictions.

William Ryan Key talks 
life after Yellowcard, EP

MUSIC REVIEW

Stepping out as a solo artist can be 
daunting for a musician, especially 
for one who has spent over a decade 
being associated with a particular 
band. Luckily, Ryan Key is up to the 
task.
Key first gained a footing in the 
musical scene in the late ‘90s, as a 
member of rock and pop punk band 
Yellowcard. He spent 17 years as the 
band’s principal songwriter, lead 
singer and rhythm guitarist, pen-
ning such hits as “Ocean Avenue” 
and “Lights and Sounds.” The band 
released its final album, Yellowcard, 
in 2016, and now Key is branching 
out on his own as a solo artist.
“After Yellowcard, I was going to 
get into some songwriting and pro-
ducing of my own,” Key said in an 
interview with The Daily. “But then 
I had this opportunity arise to play 
guitar with New Found Glory…When 
they asked me if I’d play guitar, they 
also asked if I’d open the tours, just as 
myself.”
The need for songs to play on tour 
was part of what led to Key’s debut 
solo EP, released under his full name, 
William Ryan Key. Thirteen, out May 
25 from The Lone Tree Recordings, 
is a surprising departure from the 
rock Yellowcard fans may be familiar 
with. Each of the five tracks is acous-
tic, gentle and beautifully introspec-
tive, from the clipped and poetic 
“Vultures” — which may be the most 
familiar bridge from Yellowcard 
material into this new, folksy ter-
ritory — to the existential “Great 
Unknown.”
“Over the last year or so, I’ve been 
doing a lot of smaller acoustic shows 

… I wasn’t sure if that was what I 
wanted my own songs to sound like,” 
Key said. “It took a long time to get 
started, but once I started writing the 
songs, it really started coming more 
naturally.”
The new EP is full of folk influenc-
es, both in the melodic compositions 
and lyrics of the songs. Key cited a 
wide variety of artists as instrumen-
tal in helping to build his attraction to 
singer-songwriter music, including 
Ben Folds Five, Explosions in the Sky, 
Ryan Adams, Jason Isbell, Death Cab 
for Cutie and Bon Iver.
“I’m always looking to a lot of sing-
er-songwriters,” Key said. “When 

I picked up my guitar and started 
writing, that’s where that influence 
inspired me.”
While a diverse array of influences 
factored into Thirteen, it is still by 
all means its own project. The new 
EP is a unique and individual effort, 
thanks also to the fact that it was pro-
duced by The Lone Tree Recordings, 
Key’s own recording studio based in 
Tennessee.
“I produced the EP myself with 
my friend Arun Bali. He plays guitar 
in the band Saves the Day. We co-
produced it together. He just has this 
really cool, analog, indie rock vibe,” 
Key said. “He’s an amazing guitarist 
and really had a lot of influence on 
the atmospheric songs you hear on 
the record.”
The fact that the entire EP is self-

produced through The Lone Tree 
gave Key a lot of freedom to work 
with in developing his new sound.
“The nice thing about having your 
own record studio is that you can 
press ‘record’ whenever you want,” 
said Key, adding that he knew from 
the beginning that he would aim 
to have about five songs on the EP. 
“So once I had five ideas I was like, 
well, I’m not even going to write any 
more.”
This allowed more freedom for 
making these songs sound polished 
and complete. Working on his own 
without Yellowcard to bounce ideas 
off of, Key would often “let the music 
direct [him] melodically and lyri-
cally.”
“So the process is different from 
with Yellowcard, but there are a lot of 
similarities as well,” he said.
Yellowcard often released acous-
tic versions of their own music, 
including the albums When You’re 
Through Thinking, Say Yes and Ocean 
Avenue. Nevertheless, the tender feel 
of Thirteen is new territory, and Key 
admits to being apprehensive about 
the adventurous delve into his own 
direction.
“I was nervous because it’s so mel-
low. I mean, I don’t even use a guitar 
pick on any of the songs,” he said.
Reception to the music so far has 
been positive; the single “Vultures” 
was released recently to widespread 
popular approval. Key called the pub-
lic reaction to the new music “amaz-
ing,” adding his appreciation that “no 
one’s standing out in the crowd, yell-
ing at me to play Yellowcard songs.”

On Friday, May 25, the hip hop 
world received two of the most 
highly anticipated albums of 2018: 
A$AP Rocky’s supposedly avant-
garde Testing and Pusha T’s entirely 
Kanye-produced DAYTONA.
While these projects would never 
be compared if it weren’t for their 
shared release date, as Rocky’s New 
York-swagging, 
subwoofer-rum-
bling sound and Push’s tradition-
ally bent, soul-leaning sound reside 
in completely different arenas of 
rap, it’s natural for fans (myself 
included) to have some analytical 
fun with such a big day in popular 
music. Personally, choosing just one 
of these albums to formally review 
would be a deviation from the natu-
ral thought processes of music fans 
and an ignorance to the drama and 
power of release dates, so I present 
a brief breakdown of the hip-hop 
happenings 
of May 25.
The most 
general 
distinction 
between 
these two projects is their respec-
tive degrees of experimentation. 
Pusha T, who rose to relevance 
as half of the mid-2000s rap duo, 
Clipse, largely remains in the vein of 
standard hip hop on DAYTONA — 
he drops bars about cocaine and dis-
ses Drake for ghostwriting through 
classic rap flow and the bread-and-
butter format of a few verses and 
choruses that both old and young 
heads can enjoy. The content is safe, 
and with crisp, undeniably Kanye 
beats, the album gives fans a com-
fortable listen, especially with a 
digestible runtime of twenty-one 
minutes.
Conversely, as the name indi-

cates, Testing strays from the 
traditional, and Rocky made this 
artistic experimentation known 
during the album’s rollout. Empha-
sizing his desire as an artist to push 
sonic boundaries, Rocky claimed 
his third studio album delivers 
sounds he’s never heard and might 
not be fully appreciated until three 
or four years 
post-release. 
These state-
ments 
scream 
Yeezus, 
but 
Testing 
is 
surprisingly palatable today; Rocky 
certainly plays with futuristic 
weirdness. “Distorted Records” 
opens the album with blaringly dig-
itized bass, and nearly every track 
is filled with psychedelic glitches 
and pitch-manipulation, but the 
laid-back flow and pompous lyrics 
characteristic of the Harlem rap-
per still manage to cut through the 
noise. Listeners can even hear an 
unprecedentedly auto-tuned Flacko 
on “Fukk Sleep” and “Buck Shots.”
Essentially, DAYTONA vs. Test-
ing is a question of the role of art-
ists in general: Should musicians 
deliver what’s expected for the sake 
of immediate reception, or should 
they strive to dodge expectations 
and risk temporary discomfort to 
slowly evolve their artistry and 
the artistic field as a whole? Pusha 
T might have delivered the more 
technically sound project by hip-
hop standards, but Rocky deliv-
ered a true project. With that said, 
as aforementioned, DAYTONA vs. 
Testing is also ridiculous. If one of 
these albums was released a month 
later, this article wouldn’t exist — 
it’s purely a coincidence of time. So 
instead, let’s just revel in the fact 
that on May 25, we just got to enjoy 
some good hip-hop.

Considering the well publicized 
production 
issues 
that 
plagued 
“Solo” — which saw its original 
directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller 
(“The LEGO Movie”) fired due to 
creative differences midway through 
production and replaced with Ron 
Howard (“Rush”) shortly after — 
having the finished product be at the 
least watchable is a victory. And by 
some miracle, it’s actually good.
“Solo” is a fun, one-off story that 
doesn’t pretend to be anything else. 

It’s a heist movie in space with a 
loveable cast of characters and more 
than enough terrific set pieces to 
go around. The shoddy pacing and 
subpar first act make it the weakest 
of the new wave of “Star Wars” 
movies but those looking for another 
adventure in a galaxy far, far away 
will nonetheless find themselves 
more than satisfied.
Beneath 
its 
heist 
trappings, 
“Solo” plays as part origin story and 
part fictional biopic for everyone’s 
favorite smuggler-turned-war-hero, 
Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich, “Hail, 
Caesar!”). After escaping the dystopia 

of his homeworld of Corellia, Han 
runs into a band of crooks, led by 
Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson, 
“Three Billboards outside Ebbing, 
Missouri”), who allow the young 
Solo to tag along.
When a theft goes wrong, forcing 
them to embark on a dangerous 
mission 
together, 
we 
see 
the 
beginnings of Han’s partnership 
with 
his 
Wookiee 
co-pilot, 
Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo, “Star 
Wars: The Last Jedi”), the suave, 
but two-faced, businessman Lando 
Calrissian (Donald Glover, TV’s 
“Atlanta”) 
and 
the 
Millennium 
Falcon, the fastest hunk of junk in 
the galaxy.
The role LucasFilm hopes the 
anthologies will play is clear with 
two saga films and two of these 
“Star Wars Stories” under their belt. 
While the episodic films like “The 
Force Awakens” and “The Last Jedi” 
will continue to carry “Star Wars” 
forward and ensure its longevity, the 
“Star Wars Stories” exist to recall 
the original trilogy and allow us to 
continue to play in that sandbox.
For better or for worse, “Solo” does 
just that. The interactions between 
Han and Lando are a joy to watch as 
both Ehrenreich and Glover inhabit 
their characters perfectly without 
resorting simply to impressions. 
Han’s cockiness and snark, Lando’s 

status as the smoothest of criminals 
— it’s all there. Even better, there’s 
the start of what can only be 
described as a bromance between 
man and Wookiee since “Solo” does 
more for Chewie as a character and 
his friendship with Han than any 
other “Star Wars” movie.
The weaker fanservice is less 
prevalent and apparent than in, say, 
the prequel trilogy, but the first act 
still packs in a groan-
worthy moment of 
revelation that ranks 
among 
the 
worst 
in 
the 
franchise. 
It may not be “a 
scientific explanation 
of the Force” bad, 
but I’d argue it is 
“prepubescent 
Anakin 
Skywalker 
built C-3PO” bad. In fact, the entire 
Corellia set first sequence has clunky 
moments of nostalgia that do no 
favors for the rest of the movie. As 
opposed to the sci-fi crime movie 
that follows, these scenes play more 
like “Oliver Twist” in space and 
if the first 10-to-15 minutes of the 
movie were cut, “Solo” would likely 
be better for it.
From there on out, director Ron 
Howard ably plays to the strengths 
of his cast and his characters alike. A 
heist early on is an homage to Han’s 

origins as a western archetype. 
Another sequence set on Kessel — a 
name that should be familiar to die-
hard “Star Wars” fans as the place 
where Han made his name as one 
of the greatest pilots in the galaxy — 
should certainly be in contention for 
the best set piece of 2018. 
Like its title character, “Solo” 
is a little rough around the edges 
and 
prone 
to 
the 
occasional 
overindulgence, 
but 
like 
Han 
himself, 
it’s also charming, 
charismatic and liable 
to win over even the 
most cynical among 
its audience. Overall, 
it’s a sustained thrill 
ride that starts fun 
and only gets more 
and more bombastic 
and fantastic the longer it goes.
I’ll admit that I was apprehensive 
as the lights went down and the 
LucasFilm logo lit up this time 
around — both because of the firing 
of previous directors Lord and Miller 
and the collapse of the “Star Wars” 
fanbase post-“Last Jedi” into toxic

If there was any place to start a 
dive into the French New Wave, any 
key figure to visit first, it would have 
to be the spearhead of the cinematic 
movement 
— 
the 
ever-prolific 
Francois Truffaut. Truffaut’s name 
is difficult to avoid wherever the 
history of cinema is brought up. 
Even for me, someone without any 
proper film theory education, his 
name is the first to pop up in any 
internet search, the first mentioned 
in any academic reading, the first 
slid into any conversation — and 
after watching “The 400 Blows” this 
week, I can’t say I’m surprised.
The autobiographical “The 400 
Blows” 
follows 
young 
Antoine 
Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud), an 
emotionally 
abandoned 
Parisian 
boy with a propensity for mischief 
that stems from troubled childhood 
years. Doinel never seems like a 

particularly bad kid; he thieves and 
he lies and he skips class to go to 
the cinema, but the child never acts 
malicious or vindictive in any way.
All 
things 
considered, 
the 
treatment that he receives from his 
parents and from his teacher feels 
unwarranted, as though there’s 
something else we cannot see. The 
film gives its answer in the form of 
a great scene just before the end 
where Doinel explains the trials of 
his early life to a child psychiatrist 
at a delinquent detention center. He 
speaks candidly about his mother’s 
contempt for him, and of her wish 
for an abortion.
As the veil is lifted on Doinel’s 
past, the poor boy’s reality on screen 
begins to make unfortunate sense. 
The “Blows” in the title is apparently 
a poor translation for a french idiom; 
a more accurate translation of the 
meaning of the title would be “The 
400 Practical Jokes.”
The film’s honesty is its greatest 

strength. Much praise can be 
given to Truffaut’s writing and his 
directing, but Léaud stole the show. 
He is resigned, and far too mature 
for his age, as he relays to the doctor 
the truths of his life. Throughout 
the film he is happy, interested and 
engaged in his life, emotions which 
seem more important once its 
known what is going on under the 
surface.
In terms of the script, Truffaut is 
careful with his honesty. He doesn’t 
toss the pain of his protagonist out 
in front of the audience up front, he 
waits and lets Léaud build up his 
own reputation before throwing it on 
its head. The partnership between 
the real Antoine Doinel and the one 
that appears on screen is masterful, 
and I think it has a lot to do with how 
close Truffaut was personally to the 
subject matter at hand.
Throughout his career, Truffaut 
was 
outspoken 
on 
his 
belief 
that there should be a personal 
connection between the filmmaker 
and their film, much in the way an 
author’s specific and individual 
voice shapes their novel. This 
idea became the foundation for 
Truffuat’s well documented “auteur 
theory,” which first appeared in his 

1954 essay “Une Certaine Tendance 
du Cinéma Français,” and built upon 
the concepts introduced by Astruc a 
decade before.
The bulk of the essay is criticism 
against 
the 
status-quo 
French 
cinema of the time. Many of the 
films receiving critical acclaim in 
the middle of the century were 
adaptations of great works of 
literature for the screen. While 
Truffaut doesn’t argue against the 
craftsmanship, he calls for a shift 
in the types of stories told: Away 
from recycled goods to narratives 
written for the screen, declaring 
an adaptation only of value when 
written by “a man of the cinema.”
One other thing that interested 
me in “Certaine Tendance” was 
Truffaut’s description of a specific 
story archetype that he didn’t want 
to see anymore. As he writes, “It 
is not exaggerating to say that the 
hundred-odd french films made each 
year tell the same story: It’s always a 
question of a victim… the knavery 
of his kin and the hatred among 
the members of his family lead the 
‘hero’ to his doom… the principal 
character, 
normally 
constituted 
when the curtain rises on him, finds 
himself crippled at the end of the 

play.” Truffaut stands firmly against 
helpless protagonists or protagonists 
who don’t have enough moral 
substance to resist temptation that 
would pull them away from their 
principles. I guess Truffaut wouldn’t 
like “Boogie Nights.”
Truffaut’s legacy stretches much 
further than “Certaine Tendance” 
and “The 400 Blows.” He became 
obsessed with Alfred Hitchcock 
and greater America as a whole in 
the 1960s and his films likewise 
took a bit more of a commercial 
turn. “The 400 Blows” lives up to its 
legacy seventy years later, it’s subject 
matter and the great performance by 
Léaud up front making it accessible 
to anyone.
The film benefits from its focus 
on childhood. More than any 
other narrative type, I find coming 
of age stories and stories with 
young protagonists in general are 
oftentimes easier to sympathize 
with. They lose less over time as the 
sorts of difficulties the characters 
face seem to be relatively universal. 
“The 400 Blows” takes this familiar 
narrative and elevates it. And after 
my two watches for this column, 
it has quickly become my favorite 
foreign film I’ve seen to date.

NOW.

I arrived 20 minutes early to the 
Soho movieplex because I was ter-
rified, terrified that like every other 
place in Manhattan, it would be 
unbelievably crowded. Somehow, 
the Tuesday 10:45 p.m. screening 
of “On Chesil Beach” was surpris-
ingly unattended. So I was left to sit 
alone in the third row of the empty 
theater as I snacked quietly on the 
Apple Jacks I managed to smuggle 
in from the corner deli. The film 
began with stunning, expansive 
landscape shots of the seaside and 
the sweeping tide and I felt instant-
ly transported to the English coast, 
a place I happened to be just one 
year ago. I was immersed in the 
scenery as the score 
hummed a familiar and 
exciting tune. The film, 
like the book it was 
adapted from, has an 
almost Freudian, sexu-
al attachment to music.
While the frigid and naïve Flor-
ence (Saoirse Ronan, “Lady Bird”) 
has no trouble making sweet love 
to the strings of her violin, she has 
a harder time getting intimate with 
her new husband, the fumbling and 
endearing country boy, Edward 
(Billy Howle, “The Seagull”). The 
music that plays such a large role in 
the film, including everything from 
Chuck Berry to Mozart, is notice-
ably absent from the awkward and 
cringe-worthy attempts at sexual 
relations, leaving the viewer to sit 
through the uncomfortable slurps 
and slobber that occupy the realm 
of intimacy. The awkwardness 
is tangible, making the viewer 
cringe as if they were being forced 
to watch the most uncomfortable 
porno of all time.
The film takes place over the 
wedding night of young Florence 
and Edward as they awkwardly 
attempt to play a married couple. 

Ian McEwan adapted the script 
from his own 2007 novel of the same 
name, making the film feel less like 
an adaptation and more like a visual 
companion to the novel itself. The 
quick read is sometimes referred 
to as a novella for its length and its 
short tale of woe. Like the book, the 
film expertly weaves the past with 
the present to ensure that the film 
reads more like a cohesive story and 
less like a series of disconnected 
flashbacks. However, the nuances 
of the novel are sometimes lost in 
the film’s desperate attempt to cre-
ate a tragic love story of youthful 
stupidity. The couple’s ignorance, 
while frustrating at times, repre-
sents the time before the sexual lib-
eration movement. The story takes 
place in 1962 England, a time when 
sex was a bad word and 
wives were taught to be 
submissive homemak-
ers for their husbands. 
The couple is most cer-
tainly in love as evinced 
by the romantic mon-
tages that occupy most of the stun-
ning flashbacks, yet they struggle to 
express their love in a physical way, 
prisoners to their stifled sexuality.
The viewer plays the role of 
voyeur, looking in at the most 
intimate and private moments. 
The awkwardness is emphasized 
through purposeful camera work, 
highlighting the discomfort of the 
young virgins through a tapping 
foot or a squeezed knuckle. Ronan 
and Howle skillfully portray the 
self-conscious and innocent new-
lyweds. The multi-faceted charac-
ters that McEwan has crafted are 
incredibly present in the young 
actors’ performances.
Where the book feels like a 
revolutionary and unique form of 
storytelling, utilizing time and per-
spective to add depth and meaning 
to the wedding night drama, the 
film ultimately feels average and 
expected.

‘On Chesil Beach’

Upperclass South Asian activism 

Representation 
in 
the 
media 
is 
fought 
for strongly by many 
Asians 
in 
America, 
especially Asians who 
are among those in the 
upper economic class of 
the country. From one 
perspective, 
it 
makes 
perfect 
sense 
why 
any 
underrepresented 
group would care so 
much about their role 
in media. Media has the 
largest impact on the 
way we think, whether 
we like this fact or not. 
We are constantly con-
suming, no matter what. 
When we take that small 
Instagram break while 
we’re 
studying, 
we’re 
being inundated with 
other people’s represen-
tations of themselves, 
and what people find 
the best. Similar pat-
terns can also be seen 
with even Facebook and 
Twitter.
So, of course, Asians 
care about how they’re 
represented in media. 
They’re not sex dolls, 
not 
fragile, 
not 
per-
fectly smart, not unsexy 
and do not smell bad. 
They’re not a monolith 
or 
a 
model 
minority 
and believe, rightfully 
so, that they have every 
right to be represent-
ed the same way white 

Americans are in West-
ern media.
This is a disclaimer. 
Of course, it is under-
standable 
and 
per-
fectly 
normal 
that 
Asian-Americans 
would like to see bet-
ter representation for 
themselves. 
Especially 
as they are born and 
raised 
as 
Americans, 
and because this is their 
country just as much as 
anyone else’s.
But why is this such a 
high priority in activism 
circles when it comes to 
Asians while there are 
still Asians who suffer 
from economic disem-
powerment, while there 
are still queer Asians?
Yes, 
Indians 
are 
Asians 
and 
have 
an 
incredibly high median 
income level — $100,000 
(according to the Pew 
Research Center). But 
this isn’t indicative of 
the state of all Asians. 
Bangladeshis 
have 
a 
median income of about 
$49,800, and Cambodi-
ans, Laotians, as well 
as Hmong people all 
have 
median 
incomes 
in similar ranges. These 
are two vastly different 
circumstances, and the 
circumstances 
reflect 
the different issues dif-
ferent groups have. It is 
clearly seen that there is 
a level of police violence 
associated with the lat-

ter groups that groups 
like Indians do not have 
to endure. Bangladeshis, 
Cambodians, 
Laotians 
and other Asian groups 
in similar class situa-
tions as Indians are not 
seen as anything close 
to the “model minority” 
by other Americans at 
all. They are demonized 
in America, seen as infe-
rior.
So yes, while I am 
sorry it was brutally 
painful for Indians in 
their 
mid-to-late 
20s 
who came from econom-
ic prosperity to grow up 
with Apu from the Simp-
sons being their biggest 
oppressor, this is not 
the case for many other 
Asians. 
 
Every 
time 
the same old and tired 
model 
minority 
story 
is brought back to the 
forefront in Asian activ-
ism, an erasure of other 
communities within the 
larger Asian race occurs 
and 
thus, 
minimizes 
their struggles.
It is crucial that Asians 
with 
class 
privilege 
interested in activism 
or social justice under-
stand the implications 
their class privilege has, 
as well as strive to bet-
ter not only their status 
in America but also the 
status of others — espe-
cially those who may not 
have the same economic 
power as them.

Why 
does 
the 
TV 
show “The Bold Type” 
mean everything to me? 
Because for once, a Mus-
lim woman is portrayed 
as a fierce, sexual, artis-
tic being. Representation 
matters. 
What do I have in 
common with “The Bold 
Type”?
I, too, am a proud, Mus-
lim woman who refuses to 
be oppressed by the sys-
tem. In “The Bold Type,” 
Adena is a “proud, Muslim 
lesbian” and an artist. She 
breaks every stereotype 
associated with Islam. 
She is open about her 
sexuality, dresses the way 
she wants and falls in love 
with a Black woman.
Adena also wears a 
hijab. When asked why, 
she says choosing to wear 
it makes her feel liberated. 
That’s what I want. I don’t 
wear a hijab or cover my 
hair. I want to, but on my 
own terms. Some people 
think the hijab and other 
modest Islamic clothing 
are oppressive. In some 
nations, there are laws 
that make that true, but 

in reality, the hijab sym-
bolizes different things 
for every woman who 
wears it. For me, it sym-
bolizes the strength and 
beauty of a woman. For 
me, it acknowledges that 
women are so beauti-
ful — so beautiful in fact, 
that not just any ordinary 
eyes are worthy of gazing. 
For me, it is a statement 
of feminism, fashion, and 
freedom. When I decide 
to start covering my hair, I 
want to do it because I feel 
empowered. Not because 
anyone told me I should or 
must. Not because it’s the 
proper thing for a Muslim 
woman to do. But because 
I love Allah and want to 
feel closer to Him.
When Adena is asked 
about why she’s lesbian, 
her answer has nothing 
to do with sexual desires. 
She says that she likes 
what’s in a woman’s heart.
At first, I thought this 
was widely applicable. 
That 
everyone 
should 
fall for what’s in some-
one’s heart. But now I see 
there’s much more to that. 
There’s something par-
ticularly amazing about 
women. We are expected 
to be and have been the 

backbone of society for 
most, if not all of time.
It’s hard to be a strong 
woman. Even harder to 
be a strong Black woman. 
Nearly impossible to be 
a strong Black, Muslim 
woman.
We have to deal with it 
all. Racism. Islamophobia. 
Sexism. It’s a never-end-
ing battle between what 
we want to be and what 
society thinks we are or 
should be.
That’s why “The Bold 
Type” means everything 
to me. Adena is a free spir-
it. She doesn’t care what 
anyone wants her to be or 
do. She follows her heart. 
The best part is that she 
acknowledges how imper-
fect she is. She admits to 
praying only sometimes, 
claiming that some days it 
feels more important than 
others 
and 
sometimes 
she’s just lazy.
I relate to Adena so 
much. She is an honest, 
imperfect portrayal of a 
Muslim woman. I too am 
not perfect, but Adena 
makes me proud to be 
exactly who I am.
Here’s to real represen-
tation.

Hua and Knight finish seasons

Runhao Hua charged up the 
court and hit the ball past the 
outstretched racket of Texas A&M’s 
Patrick Kypson. When the ball hit 
the ground without a return, Hua 
let out a yell to celebrate his upset 
win over the fifth-seeded Kypson 
in the second round of the NCAA 
individual singles tournament.
The senior on the Michigan 
men’s tennis team battled for the 
three-set victory after losing the 
first set 6-4. He won ten straight 
games to win the second set 6-0 
and get out to a 4-0 lead in the third 
set before Kypson began to stage a 
comeback.
But No. 47 Hua was able to hang 
on and win the third set 6-4 for 
likely the largest upset of his career 
with the Wolverines.
He earned the spot in the round 
of 32 after a straight-set defeat of 
No. 28 Johannes Ingildsen from 
Florida, who had won the previous 
meeting with Hua. This time, 
though, Hua was able to battle for 
a 7-5 first set win and cruise to a 6-2 
victory in the second set.
In the round of 16, Hua saw his 
run in the tournament come to an 
end with a loss to No. 9-16 seeded 
Mazen Osama out of Florida. 
He lost the first set 6-1, but in 
the second came back from a 5-3 
deficit to be within one game of 
Osama before dropping the set and 
ultimately the match. 
Hua’s fellow Michigan senior 
Alex Knight also competed in 

the singles tournament as one 
of the No. 9-16 seeded players, 
but Knight’s senior season had a 
more disappointing ending. After 
earning a unanimous selection 
to the All Big-Ten first team and 
notching a 25-8 record on the 
season, Knight was upset by 
Vanderbilt’s Cameron Klinger in 
straight sets.
Knight and Hua also combined 
as the Wolverines’ doubles pair for 
the NCAA doubles tournament. 
The 
partnership 
had 
been 
successful throughout its Michigan 
career — marking a 16-7 record 
during the 2017-2018 season.
That 
success 
didn’t 
carry 
through to the tournament as the 
duo fell 6-2, 6-2 to No. 17 Fabien 
Fallert and Tim Sandkaulen of the 
University of Mississippi in the 
first round of play.
Though their senior seasons 
didn’t 
end 
with 
a 
national 
championship, both Hua and 
Knight have played large roles 
in the Wolverines’ success since 
arriving in Ann Arbor. The seniors 
have been prominent figures in the 
lineups since their freshman years, 
making their graduations a big 
change for the team.
With Michigan ending the 
season ranked fourteenth in the 
country by the ITA and a large 
class of freshmen coming in the 
fall, it stands to reason that Knight 
and Hua will see their spots filled 
soon and the team’s success will 
continue.
But the legacies they’ve left will 
be much harder to replace.

Senior Runhao Hua ended his final season with Michigan in the NCAA Tournament

Eight Wolverines qualify for NCAA 
Outdoor Championships in Tampa

Two hundred meters from 
elimination, 
Sarah 
Zieve 
wasn’t about to go quietly.
The top three finishers in 
her 3000-meter steeplechase 
heat 
at 
the 
NCAA 
East 
Preliminary in Tampa, Fla. 
would qualify to the NCAA 
Outdoor Championships in 
Eugene, Ore. Zieve sat in 
seventh, her shoe untied and 
her season on the brink of 
elimination. 
Nevertheless, she began a 
desperate sprint and didn’t 
stop until she crossed the 
finish line — 
placing in third 
by .13 seconds 
with a time of 
10:07.58.
“Definitely 
as amazing as 
a comeback as 
I’ve ever seen,” 
said Michigan 
women’s 
distance coach 
Mike McGuire. 
“ … Within the last lap, it 
was like the barriers weren’t 
even there the way she was 
hurdling.”
While 
her 
race 
wasn’t 
nearly as drama-filled, senior 
Claire Borchers — the Big Ten 
champion in the event — also 
qualified for nationals in the 
steeplechase. She stayed with 
the lead pack the entire time 
and finished her heat with a 
time of 9:58.57, good enough 
for the sixth-best time overall.
Joining them in Eugene 
will 
be 
fifth-year 
senior 
Haley Meier who had never 
qualified for nationals in the 
1500-meter despite a close 
call last year. Refusing to 
drop lower than fifth in her 
heat — where the top five 
automatically qualify — Meier 
left nothing to chance as she 
stayed in the upper echelon of 
her race through its entirety. 
She finished fourth with a 
time of 4:15.47 and extended 
the Wolverines’ seven-year 
streak of qualifying runners 
to the NCAA Championships 
in the event.

“She did a great job of 
positioning herself,” McGuire 
said. “(She) had a pulse on 
where she was at, where she 
needed to be.”
***
The rain came in droves, 
horizontal and unrelenting.
It’s hard to compete in 
the high jump in the rain. It 
gives the ground less traction 
and messes with the normal 
aerodynamics of the event, 
forcing jumpers to alter their 
speed and entry.
Watching 
redshirt 
sophomore Brandon Piwinski 
compete, you wouldn’t be able 
to tell.
Piwinski 
took 
only one attempt 
to 
clear 
each 
of his first two 
heights — 2.06 
and 2.11 meters. 
Though he failed 
to reach his next 
height 
of 
2.16 
meters, 
so 
did 
all but four other 
competitors 
in 
the preliminary. 
With 12 spots in the NCAA 
Championships and number 
of previous attempts serving 
as 
a 
tiebreaker, 
Piwinski 
easily made the cut — the 
Michigan men’s track and 
field team’s first to qualify in 
the event since 1994.
“Brandon 
jumped 
and 
he made his two attempts 
in basically a downpour,” 
said Michigan coach Jerry 
Clayton. “ … Our people were 
— really handled themselves 
quite well with making those 
adjustments.”
***
Grant Cartwright had one 
last shot at keeping his career 
alive.
After 
failing 
to 
qualify 
for nationals in the hammer 
throw on Thursday, the senior 
had only the shot put left, but 
his first two throws weren’t 
going to cut it.
He stepped into the ring, 
spun and threw. This time, it 
didn’t end in disappointment.
His final attempt measured 
19.53 meters — a personal 
best that rocketed him into 

seventh place, good enough to 
punch his ticket to Eugene.
Meanwhile, 
redshirt 
sophomore Andrew Liskowitz 
unleashed 
a 
19.27-meter 
throw on his first attempt 
— one he knew would likely 
qualify him. But he didn’t 
stop 
there, 
improving 
on 
each subsequent attempt. His 
final throw of 19.92 meters 
garnered third place overall 
and another nationals berth 
for the Wolverines.
“It only took a good first-
round throw, (they) get into 
a rhythm,” Clayton said. “ … 
Credit to them for staying 
focused.”

Joining 
Piwinski, 

Cartwright 
and 
Liskowitz 
in Eugene will be junior 
Taylor McLauglin in the 400-
meter hurdles — his third 
consecutive year qualifying 
— and fifth-year senior Ben 
Flanagan in the 10,000-meter. 
Both were Big Ten champions 
in their respective events.
Perhaps more noticeable, 
though, was one athlete who 
didn’t make it.
Heralded all season as an 
integral part of Michigan’s 
“Meat 
Factory” 
throwing 
contingent, redshirt junior 
Joe Ellis holds the school 
record in the hammer throw 
and 
missed 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Outdoor 
Championships 
record by centimeters. But in 
the NCAA preliminaries, it 
doesn’t matter what records 
you 
hold. 
Three 
throws 
determine the course of your 
season.
And for Ellis, those three 
throws weren’t enough. Two 
fouls in his three attempts 
eliminated 
his 
margin 
of 
error, and his one fair heave 
landed short. He placed just 
15th, ending his season.
“This meet’s a tough meet,” 
Clayton said. “(He) kind of 
lost his rhythm after the first 
throw and wasn’t — normally, 
he’s been able to readjust and 
come through and this time it 
just didn’t work.
“ … He’s had a great season, 
he’s competed really well for 
us at the conference level, and 
you can’t take that away.”

Lavert Hill cames back to 100 percent 

DETROIT — It’s not often 
that a Michigan football coach 
questions one of his players 
publicly. 
But 
that 
was 
the 
method Michael Zordich used 
when junior Lavert Hill missed 
at least eight practices with a hip 
and leg injury earlier this spring.
The secondary coach said Hill 
needs “learn to 
play with some 
nicks” 
in 
mid-
April, 
marking 
the 
second 
consecutive 
offseason 
where 
ailments 
have 
kept 
the 
cornerback 
off 
the field.
But Hill didn’t 
need the message 
for motivation.
“I don’t get none of that. It 
just goes through one ear and 
out the other,” Hill said Sunday 
afternoon. “I don’t really know. I 
just focus on my game.”
In any case, Hill says he’s now 
fully healthy after participating 
in the final few practices of the 
spring.
“I’m good. I’m 100 percent 
right now,” Hill said. “It just 
came over time, keep exercising, 
doing stuff, what the trainers 
told me to do. It worked out 
pretty fine.
“It just felt like I never left. 
Just being 100 percent feels 
good. When I’m 100 percent, I 
can do anything.”

That was evident for Hill last 
season, when he made 25 tackles, 
seven pass breakups and two 
interceptions in 13 starts. But as 
one of Michigan’s nine returning 
starters on defense, he realizes 
there’s plenty of room to grow.
Hill 
said 
he’s 
specifically 
working 
on 
jamming 
wide 
receivers at the line of scrimmage, 
along 
with 
perfecting 
route 
reading 
— 
both 
physical 
intricacies of his 
trade. In the past 
year, 
however, 
he’s 
noticed 
his 
biggest 
improvement 
is 
on 
the 
mental 
side. 
“I’m better as 
far as the mental 
part of the game,” 
Hill said. “Just 
slowing 
things 
down, studying film, getting 
to know things better, and just 
pacing myself and keeping it 
slowly in my head.”
Hill, along with Michigan 
sophomore Ambry Thomas, even 
got a taste of what could lie ahead 
if those improvements continue. 
The pair visited Jourdan Lewis 
– the former Michigan All-
American and current Dallas 
Cowboys corner — to train in 
Dallas last weekend.
And 
even 
when 
Lewis’ 
attention shifted to attractions of 
the downtown area, football took 
priority for Hill and Thomas, 
catching Lewis’ attention.
“They always want to work,” 
Lewis said. “It’s refreshing to see 

guys who just want to be a part 
of something great. They want 
to work, and everything is about 
football.
“It was amazing (watching 
them). They were way better 
than what I did. Just the strides 
they’ve been taking are so far 
away from where we were at 
their age. It’s going to come to 
fruition when the game slows 
down and they get the mental 
part down.”
Lewis, Hill and Thomas have 
known each other for years 
from 
playing 
youth 
football 
together in Detroit. Sunday was 
a throwback to those days, as 
Lewis, along with Hill’s brother 
and former Michigan standout, 
Delano, hosted a free WR vs. 
DB skills camp at Detroit PAL 
Headquarters.
It was one of many trips for 
Lewis back to his home state this 
offseason. In March, he returned 
for Michigan’s Pro Day and got to 
watch the current team practice.
“I noticed the schedule is 
different, 
Lewis 
said. 
“(The 
players are) getting more free 
time. It feels like (coach Jim 
Harbaugh) understands these 
kids know what to do. They know 
what’s at risk. They want to win.
“I believe they’re national 
contenders. 
They 
have 
all 
the pieces, they have all the 
coaches, they have the guys at 
every position to get done what 
they want to get done. It’s just 
about coming together now, just 
executing out there on the field 
on Saturdays.”

BASEBALL
Michigan ends season 
with loss to Ohio State

As senior third baseman Brock 
Keener sat down for his press 
conference for the last time as a 
Wolverine, his eyes were red with the 
tears that only come after a season-
ending defeat.
The Michigan baseball team (15-8 
Big Ten, 33-21 overall) fell to Ohio 
State (14-10 Big Ten, 36-21 overall) 5-3, 
and Keener was faced with the hard 
realization that he had just played his 
last game in a maize and blue uniform. 
Likely falling short of a bid to the 
NCAA Touranment, the team exited 
the Big Ten Tournament earlier than 
needed.
In many ways, Keener’s toughness 
and resilience serves as a perfect 
embodiment of the team itself.
Early in the season, Keener broke 
the thumb on his glove hand—a 
troubling injury for any baseball player, 
but Keener is a catcher. Any physical 
ailments to a catcher’s appendages, 
and their ability to do their job greatly 
diminishes.
But Keener stuck it out and fought 
for his role on the Michigan lineup. 
After all, this was his senior season.
Keener’s injury showed in his play 
behind home plate. Many passed balls 
snuck past him, and the Wolverines 
saw their fair share of wild pitches. 
But none of that deterred Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. Keener caught for 
as long as he was physically able and 
Bakich indulged his senior, seeing as 
he consistently gave the Wolverines 
their best chance to win.
“Tough, competitive kid,” Bakich 
said on Keener. “Good lesson for a lot 
of those younger guys on our team 
for them to see what that grit and 
competitiveness looks like.”
Heading 
into 
the 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament, Keener’s thumb reached 
the point of no return, and he simply 
was not able to catch anymore. 
Wanting his bat and grit in the lineup, 
Bakich shocked Michigan followers 
and played Keener at third base.
Keener played as valiantly as 
anyone could ask of the senior, 
making web gem plays on defense and 
cranking clutch hit after clutch hit.
On Friday’s match, with the 
Wolverines 
trailing 
5-1, 
Keener 
stepped to the plate with runners on 
second and third and two outs. With 
the clutch gene seemingly coded into 
his physiological makeup, the catcher 
turned third baseman smacked a two-

RBI single right up the middle. In one 
swing of the bat, Keener gave his team 
exactly what it needed and kept the 
game competitive.
“I guess (I) try not to view it as a 
big AB because the guys in front of me 
worked hard to get on, and all these 
games were nail biters,” Keener said. 
“It’s tough, and I try to do whatever I 
can to help the team win.”
Now all Keener can do is sit and 
reflect on his time at Michigan and his 
legacy. There’s no doubt that toughness 
is the first word people will associate 
with the catcher with a broken thumb.
“For me, this season, has taught 
me, really through my whole college 
career up until this season is resilience 
and to truly love something, you keep 
giving it your all,” Keener said. “For 
me personally, this was my journey to 
Michigan and my time at Michigan. 
This season was the same thing, it 
doesn’t always start out how you 
want it. I’m blessed to be a part of this 
team and blessed to be a Michigan 
Wolverine, that’s for sure.”
Added 
junior 
center 
fielder 
Jonathan Engelmann: “Brock here is a 
guy who’s overcome everything that I 
can possibly imagine. You play games 
for guys like that. Just for example 
in this tournament when he played 
third base, it was like, ‘Who is this guy 
who’s making web gem plays left and 
right.’ He’s always overcoming, and he 
puts the team first. In college, you’re 
playing with guys just like that, and it’s 
inspiring to say the least.”
Barring some sort of divine 
intervention, the Wolverines will fall 
short of making an NCAA Regional. 
To put it simply, Michigan did not beat 
enough good teams.
However, the Wolverines boast 
one of the youngest cores in the Big 
Ten and won’t be down for long. This 
time next year may be a different 
story, and it will have all started with 
the foundation laid by the juniors and 
seniors who will leave Ann Arbor next 
year for the workforce or the MLB 
Draft.
So come Monday during the NCAA 
Selection Show, the Michigan baseball 
team will gather together one last 
time. If or when its name doesn’t get 
called, Bakich wants the freshmen to 
remember the feeling.
“We may not see our name on the 
screen on Monday,” Bakich said, “but 
I want them to feel that as well and 
especially for those younger guys 
because that will be the last time they 
ever feel that.”

Charles Matthews announced 
Wednesday afternoon he has 
withdrawn 
his 
name 
from 
NBA Draft consideration and 
will be returning to Michigan 
for 
another 
season. 
The 
announcement 
comes 
mere 
hours before the deadline for 
early entrants to make a final 
decision.
“After 
much 
prayer 
and 
discussions with my family 
and the staff, I am excited 
to be returning to Michigan 
next year,” Matthews said, 
via a statement released by 
the program. “I learned a 
lot throughout this process, 
but my main focus will now 
be completing my education 

at Michigan and leading my 
teammates to more success next 
season.”
In his first season on the 
court for Michigan, Matthews 
averaged 13 points and 5.5 
rebounds 
per 
game, 
good 
for second on the team in 
both 
categories. 
His 
year 
was highlighted by a late-
season resurgence, including 
scoring 
in 
double 
figures 
in 
five 
consecutive 
NCAA 
Tournament games and being 
named the West Region’s Most 
Outstanding Player on the way 
to the Final Four.
He will still have two more 
years of eligibility at Michigan 
if 
he 
so 
chooses, 
having 
transferred 
after 
only 
one 
season at Kentucky. He did not 
receive an invitation to the NBA 

combine this month and was 
widely regarded as a late second 
round pick at best in many mock 
drafts.
Matthews took advantage of 
the early draft entry this past 
month, working out for NBA 
teams and receiving feedback 
on 
areas 
of 
improvement. 
Shooting seems likely to be atop 
that list. Matthews became 
a 
capable 
if 
unspectacular 
shooter 
throughout 
the 
year. He attempted just four 
3-pointers his freshman season 
at Kentucky. This past season 
he shot 107 threes, hitting at an 
adequate 32 percent clip.
Though Matthews’ 3-point 
shooting seems to be the most 
glaring area for improvement 
if he eventually seeks an NBA 
career, it surely isn’t the only 

one. 
Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beilein would frequently note 
— often unprovoked — that 
the staff charted his assist-
to-turnover ratio in practice 
from the day he stepped on 
campus. He said Matthews 
started out with three times as 
many turnovers as assists. Last 
season, Matthews had 14 more 
assists 
(98) 
than 
turnovers 
(84)— an unremarkable stat 
by itself, but a clear sign of an 
evolving player in context.
“Charles has an incredible 
personality 
and 
confidence. 
His work habits and desire to 
reach his potential are terrific,” 
Beilein said in a statement. 
“He is more focused than ever 
to improve in all areas of his 
game.” 
On a team losing three key 

offensive contributors in Moritz 
Wagner, 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman and Duncan 
Robinson, Matthews will step 
into a more prominent offensive 
role where his growth on the 
court will be vital.
Matthews will look to make 
those 
improvments 
while 
providing necessary leadership 
on a team replete with talent, 
but short on experience. Next 
season, Matthews will be the 
lone senior on scholarship — 
though he will still maintain 
a year of eligibility after next 
year due to his redshirt season.
Added Beilein: “Like others 
before him, Charles will be a 
great senior leader for us and 
we are excited to have this 
opportunity to coach him again 
next season.”
