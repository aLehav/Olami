' GETS $110M DONATION
GIFT IS LARGEST IN UNIVERSITY HISTORY

Billionaire
funds first-ever
graduate student
residence hall
By JENNIFER CALFAS
Daily StaffReporter
At the University's Board of
Regents meeting on Thursday,'
University President Mary Sue
Coleman announced the con-
struction of a new residence
hall for graduate students.
Funded in part by a $110
million gift from University
alum Charles Munger - the
largest single donation to the
University in its history -
the residence hall will focus
on creating a community for
graduate students from mul-
tiple disciplines. The project
will cost $180 million, the
remainder funded by Univer-
sity Housing lease revenue.
Munger is the vice president
of Berkshire Hathaway, a
global holding company. His
estimated net worth as of

2013 is $l.lbillion.
The gift also includes a
$10-million donation for fel-
lowships to help create a resi-
dential society to promote
conversation and collaboration
among students.
The University received a
$50 million donation to the
LSA Masters of Fine Arts in
Creative Writing program
from the Zell Family Founda-
tion in March, making last two
flagship donations dedicated
to graduate programs.
The residence hall will be
home to 600 graduate students
in a 370,000-square-foot,
eight-story building located
on Central Campus between
South Division and Thomp-
son streets - a space par-
tially occupied by the recently
acquired Blimpy Burger prop
erty. The eighth floor will fea-
ture gatheringspaces, a fitness
center with a running track
and a "Fellows' Room" with a
panoramic view of the campus
and downtown.
In an interview Thursday,
Timothy Slottow, the Univer-
sity's executive vice president

and chief financial officer,
said Munger and the Univer-
sity jointly identified the site,
and that the donor has been
actively involved in the proj-
ect design.
Slottow added that discus-
sions of building the new resi-
dence hall began about a year
ago when Munger expressed
his fascination with solv-
ing the challenge of creating
functional graduate student
housing.
"He simply inspired the
idea, and, of course, we were
interested, but we simply could
not do it without his help,"
Slottow said.
He added Munger hopes
to create a unique space for
graduate students since under-
graduate housing has been the
University's primary focus in
recent years.
"Graduate students, as he
says, do have extremely busy
and challenging intellectual
lives which leads to a lot of
solitary study, and having a
high quality living arrange-
ment with high quality living

Coleman announces
July 2014 retirement

Search for next

during summer
By PETER SHAHIN and

and Daily StaffReporters
At the University's Board
of Regents meeting Thurs-
day, University Presi-

dent Mary Sue Coleman
announced her intention to
retire after her term expires
in July 2014 without seeking
a contract extension.
"Leading the University
of Michigan is the most
challenging and reward-
ing work of my career. It's
a tremendous privilege and
one that continuously ener-
gizes me," she said at the
meeting.
Coleman began her ten-
ure as the University's 13th

president in August 2002,
succeeding Lee Bollinger,
now president of Colum-
bia University. Her succes-
sor will be chosen by the
Board of Regents, which has
already been preparing for
her long-expected retire-
ment.
Coleman is the fourth-
longest serving president in
the history of the Univer-
sity, and the first president
to serve more than a decade

Regents approve $65
per-student fee to
pay for renovations
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Inside the Michigan Union at
Thursday's meeting of the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents, the regents
decided to administer a $65-per-
term student fee to fund renova-
tion of the Union and recreational
sports facilities.
The building, constructed in
1919, willundergo a restoration sen-
sitive to its architectural heritage
and upgrade student organization
offices for a cost of $173 million.
The University will begin assessing
the student fee in fiscal year 2015.
The project will encompass the
Union, Pierpont Commons, North

Campus Recreation Building, Cen-
tral Campus Recreation Building
and the Intramural Sports Build-
ing. The Michigan League will not
receive any funding.
The goals for each building
include repairs and upgrades of
underlying infrastructure and core
systems. The CCRB and NCRB will
each receive some additions. Stu-
dents spaces will be updated in the
Union and improved playing sur-
faces will be constructed at Mitch-
ell Fields on Fuller Road between
the University Hospital and North
Campus.
In a communication to the
regents, E. Royster Harper, vice
president for student affairs, noted
all renovations would take precau-
tions to preserve the 94-year-old
building's history.
The projects will be completed
over a number of years, akin to the
ongoing Residence Hall Initiative

of the past decade. The Board of
Regents will approve each individ-
ual project at future meetings.
The Union was last renovated
in 1994, in a project that encom-
passed the entire building. In 1972,
the fourth floor, which previously
consisted of hotel rooms, was con-
verted into office space for student
organizations.
At most other higher education
institutions, common spaces and
recreational facilities are typically
supported by student fees separate
from tuition and housing charges.
The University worked with
Central Student Government and
the LSA Student Government to
garner support for the project.
Student governments from 15 Uni-
versity schools and colleges have
endorsed support for the plan.
In February, the University sent
out a survey across campus to stu-

'Positive' outlook
for tuition equality

McGary, Robinson to stay with Blue

Coleman alludes
to impending
recommendation
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter t
Nearly a year ago, students
donning bright maize shirts
attended a University Board of
Regents meeting to show sup-
port of the then-budding tuition
equality movement.
On Thursday, more than
50 student supporters charg-
ing undocumented Michigan
residents in-state tuition rates
attended the last regents meeting
of the semester to show that the
issue has yet to be resolved. But
they didn't leave without a sug-
gestion that the goal may soon be
realized.
"I know well that there is stu-
dent interest in tuition equity,"
University President Mary Sue
Coleman said. "We're looking
very seriously at this issue, and
we fully expect that we will have
a positive recommendation to the
board in the coming months."
In a notable acknowledgement
that wasn't listed on the meet-
ing's agenda, Coleman hinted
that she may advise the Board of
Regents to move a policy change.
Coleman's statement appeared
to tacitly confirm that the Uni-

versity would begin looking at
substantive policy changes in the
near term - even if legal barri-
ers hinder its implementation. A
number of the regents have also
expressed support for the prin-
ciple of tuition equality.
A large number of students
from the Coalition for Tuition
Equality and other groups tried
to attend the meeting, but many
were turned away after the
Anderson room in the Michigan
Union reached full capacity.
Less than 24 hours before,
40 protesters rallied against the
University's current policy of
charging out-of-state tuition to
undocumented Michigan resi-
dents by blocking traffic at the
intersection of State Street and
South University Avenue. After
eight of the protestors refused to
leave the street, they were arrest-
ed by University Police.
On Thursday, the supporters
- staging a "study-in" - stacked
the set-up audience chairs,
instead sitting on the ground to
study. LSA sophomore Connor
Caplis, a member of the board
of the University's undergradu-
ate chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, and LSA sopho-
more Ramiro Alvarez, the future
leader of the Coalition for Queer
People of Color, spoke in support
of tuition equality during the

Beilein: Freshman
exceeded expectations,
will return with energy
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
It's all settled - no more questions regard-
ing personnel for the 2013-14 Michigan men's
basketball team.
Freshmen forwards Mitch McGary and
Glenn Robinson III announced Thursday
that they will be returning for their sopho-
more seasons at Michigan instead of entering
the 2013 NBA Draft. Earlier this week, soph-
omore guard Trey Burke and junior guard
TimHardaway Jr. announced their depar-
ture from the program.
"We're so thrilled, the teammates are
thrilled to be playing again with these two
young men who, as freshmen, probably
exceeded some expectations that some peo-
ple had for them," said Michigan coach John
Beilein at a press conference on Wednesday.
"They're going to return to this team with
energy, with talent, but most importantly
with attitude that has been so important to
any of the success that we've had."
McGary said he made his decision on
Tuesday after talking with his parents and
the coaching staff extensively, saying it was
"50-50" before he made his choice Tuesday
night. The rising sophomore noted one of the
reasons for returning was because he wanted
"to be a kid for one more year" before going
to the NBA.
McGary was one of the breakout players in
this year's NCAA Tournament, averaging a
double-double (14.3 points and 10.7 rebounds
per game) in the Wolverines' run to the
National Championship game. After show-

ing improvement over the course of the sea-
son, McGary earned a starting spot entering
the NCAA Tournament, replacing redshirt
junior forward Jordan Morgan.
And as McGary erupted, his NBA draft
stock soared. Some draft projections had
McGary as high as alottery pick after his per-
formance in the tournament, though some
experts thought McGary should remain at
Michigan to continue to develop because he
hadn't been consistent.
With McGary back, Michigan is return-
ing its full backcourt - McGary, Morgan,
redshirt sophomore Jon Horford and red-
shirt freshman Max Bielfeldt - and adding
incoming freshman Mark Donnal. McGary

will likely keep his starting spot he earned at
the end of last season.
"His goals should be to be able to play face-
up, high-post player, but also when they put
smaller playersonhim,togo downontheblock
and just put it in," Beilein said. "He's gotten
much better at that. Habits come and habitsgo,
his footwork - if I could look at his footwork
in October and look at it now, it's a completely
different type of balance he has now."
Robinson took until Wedlnesday night
to finalize his choice, but he said he could't
say how diose he was to leaving because he's
"known" he's wanted to come back to the
University.

County-led project prepares

social change with competition for shopping complex opening

Student groups
compete for social

ByAMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily News Reporter
Changing the world needs to
start somewhere. Through their
Social Innovation Showcase,
the entrepreneurial e organiza-
tion optiMize hopes that change
begins with them.
optiMize connects aspiring
entrepreneurs with the resources
and skills needed to build a busi-
ness with a social conscience.
After a semester dedicated to
constructing pitches, analyzing
consumer'markets and develop-
ing products, optiMize members
came together Thursday evening
to present new social innova-
tions to a public audience.
As winter semester com-
menced, so did preparations

for what would become opti-
Mize's first Social Innovation
Challenge. Nineteen teams of
students, representing a range
of schools and colleges, came
under optiMize's umbrella to be
connected with resources that
would help them create sustain-
able business models.
As the process neared an end,
five teams of social entrepre-
neurs were selected out of the
19 to present their pitches at the
Showcase on Thursday evening.
The teams who presented and
competed at the Social Innova-
tion Showcase included Beyond
Bounds, a program helping Uni-
versity underclassman be more
proactive and make better use of
university resources; Volunteer
Buddy, a mobile application con-
necting prospective volunteers
with non-profit organizations;
ReSource Fund, a micro-financ-
ing scheme helping low-income
community members avoid
financial exploitation through

one-on-one coaching; ReGrow
Detroit, a branch of the Michigan
Union.Urban Farming Initiative
that proposes to turn blighted
homes into agricultural hotspots;
and the Detroit Entrepreneur-
ship Network, an organization
revitalizing entrepreneurship
among Detroit youth.
The optiMize cash prize was
awardednotthroughaconvention-
al selection process but through
the calculation of the volume of the
crowd's cheers. The Detroit Entre-
preneurship Network collected
the loudest audience reaction and
swept the award.

Although Ann Arbor's Briar-

for shoppers, Reiswerg said
Arbor Hills will not compete
with the mall due to funda-

that Arbor Hills favors local
Ann Arbor retailers, while Bri-

and community spaces would be
terrific in a location that is just
prime," Slottow said.
Currently, the Northwood
Apartments on North Campus
are the only non-staff housing
spaces available for graduate stu-
dents.
"Most universities do not take
a community-like approach, and
this project envisions an approach
that makes graduate study less
isolated," Coleman said. "We see
this as a revolutionary concept
and an exciting opportunity for
us to nurture graduate education
within our ecosystem."
Regent Andrea Fischer New-
man (R-Ann Arbor) echoed
Coleman, saying Michigan will
be the only university to have a
residential hall option for gradu-
ate students.
Newman added that one of the
purposes of the regents' January
trip to California was to speak
with Munger.
"This was one of the reasons
we went to Los Angeles," Mung-
er said. "His involvement and
interest is unlike anything I've
ever seen before, and we're just
thrilled. This will set Michigan
apart from every other Univer-
sity inthe countrywith dedicated

graduate housing across disci-
plines."
The regents approved the
purchases of four properties in
the area between West Quad
Residence Hall and the Perry
Building to create space for the
residence hall. The $3.16 million
purchase will acquire proper-
ties at 535 and 537 South Division
Street and 401 and 409 East Mad-
ison Street, which are registered
to former Athletic Director Bill
Martin. The funds will also be
used to purchase properties at
541 and 543 South Division Street
through eminent domain, which
allows the University to force to
the owner, Copi Properties, to sell
the property for a fair, market-
value price.
The regents also voted to name
the newly approved residential
hall in honor of Munger. In 2007,
Munger donated $3 million to
the Law School for lighting and
infrastructure improvements in
Hutchins Hall and the William
W. Cook Legal Research Library.
In addition, Munger contributed
$20 million more for renovations
within the Lawyer's Club, which
are currently underway.
While Slottow presented the
naming to the board as the "easi-
est" action to approve, Coleman
said Munger's contribution was a
"monumental act of generosity."
In a statement issued at the

meeting, Munger said the dona-
tion reflects his appreciation for
the University.
"I particularly want to avoid
any perception that I claim large
donative merit," Munger said.
"After all, I waited until my 90th
year before making the gift, then
gained friendship and creative
joy in working with the univer-
sity in a very interesting design
effort likely to have a good out-
come, while I parted with assets
I soon won't need."
The University has contracted
with Integrated Design Solutions
and Hartman-Cox Architects to
design the new residence hall. To
continue the University's efforts
towards sustainability, the build-
ing will be constructed based on
U.S. Green Building Council's
LEED certification system. The
residence hall will also exceed
standard energy efficiency codes
by more than 30 percent.
Slottow added that the addi-
tion of a residence hall could
potentially lead to more students
to apply for graduate programs at
the University.
"I don't think there's any
question that it will transform
our ability to continue to be an
even stronger attractor to stu-
dents because it will be such
an iconic building and trans-
formative living experience for
graduate students."

University President Mary Sue Coleman greets the Michigan men's basketball team at the Board of Regents meeting in the
Union Thursday.

since Robben Fleming's regular
appointment ended in 1979.
After receiving her under-
graduate degree in chemistry
from Grinnell College in Iowa,
she received a doctorate in bio-
chemistry from the University
of North Carolina. Coleman
served as the director of a can-
cer research center at the Uni-
versity of Kentucky for 20 years
before serving as president of
the University of Iowa for seven
years.
"The University of Michigan
deserves the best in a leader,
and I want to give the Board of
Regents ample time to select the
next president," Coleman said in
a statement.
In an interview after the
meeting, Coleman said she has
no plans to decelerate her busy
schedule during the remaining
15 months on the job. She will
continue to engage other donors
throughout the alumni commu-
nity.
"I love to listen and I have this
great group of people around me
that helped me create the vision
and I really try to translate the
vision and help people under-
stand when they've given a big
gift, it will be the happiest day of
(their) lives," Coleman said.
In addition, Coleman said she
will focus on completing other
renovations and implementing
.a strategic plan for health-care
changes.
"We just have a lot of work to
do, and I'm goingto be excited by
that work and not slowed down
for a second," Coleman said.
University Provost Phil Han-
lon praised Coleman's efforts
during her tenure at the Univer-
sity - citing her work to improve
academic quality, increase inter-
national reputation and rec-
ognition, grow the application
pool, reduce costs for students
with need and oversee the most
successful capital campaign in
University history as evidence
of leaving a legacy with the Uni-
versity.
"It's just really amazing what
she's done just as a friend and
a mentor," Hanlon said. "I've
learned so much from her. She's
been a terrific leader."
Regent Andrea 'Fischer
Newman (R) echoed Hanlon's
positive statements, praising,
Coleman's ability to keep the
University thriving and pros-
perous during harsh economic
times with decreased state
appropriation and federal sup-
port.
"This University is doing
phenomenally under her leader-
ship," Newman said. "This is a
huge, huge loss, you know, but
it's her decision."
Her tenure at the University
has faced a number of chal-
lenges - foremost building a
new budget model in the face
of declining state revenues.
State support for the Univer-
sity of Michigan has declined
from around 35 percent of the
University's budget in 2002
to less than 17 percent this
year. Colemanalso was forced
to confront the University of

Michigan Health System's six-
month delay in reporting a

medical resident's possession
of child pornography to Uni-
versity Police and a scandal in
which former basketball team
booster Ed Martin admitted
to running an illegal gambling
operation from which he laun-
dered money to members of
the Michigan men's basketball
team.
In a presentation to the
regents, Martha Pollack, vice
provost for academic and bud-
getary affairs, said tuition
has increased by more than 5
percent per year over the last
decade in order to help make
up for losses in state appropria-
tions.
At the same time, the Uni-
versity has also made substan-
tial contributions to centrally
allocated financial aid to help
offset costs for disadvantaged
students.
Early in her presidency, Cole-
man also championed the Uni-
versity's defense of race-based
affirmative action admissions
policies before the U.S. Supreme
Court.,In two separate rulings,
the court decided that the Uni-
versity could use a "holistic"
review process, meaning each
candidate would be judged by
the individual contributions
they might make to the overall
campus environment.
Despite a very public cam-
paign by Coleman, Michigan
voters adopted Proposal 2 in
2006, which outlawed the use of
race-based admissions in higher
education. She has maintained
her stance on affirmative action
and spoken out on more recent
rulings on the controversial pol-
icy as well.
Coleman also spearheaded the
University's largest capital cam-
paign, The Michigan Difference,
which ended in 2008 and raised
$3.2 billion. The campaign
helped finance renovations to
or construction of a number of
campus buildings, including
the Public Policy School's Weill
Hall, the C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital, and the Ross School of
Business.
The University is set to
launch its next capital cam-
paign this fall. The total
goal has not yet been set, but
according to a tweet sent by
Regent Mark Bernstein dur-
ing his Twitter Town Hall on
Wednesday, the campaign will
aim to raise at least $1 billion
for financial aid.
Besides the projects funded
through the capital campaign,
Coleman has shepherded the
Residence Life Initiative to ren-
ovate a number of University
Housing facilities. Since 2002,
Alice Lloyd, Mosher-Jordan and
others have been renovated in
the first phase of the program.
Construction of North Quad
Residence Hall was completed
in 2010 and South Quad and
West Quad Residence Halls are
slated for renovations in the next
two years.
As the president of the Uni-
versity, Coleman has also trav-
eled to a number of countries
to establish partnerships and
engage with alumni and educa-
tional leaders around the world.
In her official capacity, she will
have traveled to China, South

Africa, the United Arab Emir-
ates, Brazil, Israel and Ghana.

She will take her final official
trip abroad to India in Novem-
ber.
While Coleman of the Asso-
ciation of American Universities
for one year - from October 2011
to October 2012 - she served as
spokesperson for the associa-
tion.
Primarily focusing on
research, Coleman represented
AAU in meetings with national
policymakers to discuss issues
related to research and gradu-
ate, professional and undergrad-
uate education.
After AAU appointed her,
Coleman said she hoped to rep-
resent the University's work
in research well in her future
meetings.
"The contributions and dis-
coveries of research universi-
ties are integral to the forward
momentum of our country,"
Coleman said. "I look forward
to giving voice to our impor-
tant work in the upcoming
year."
AAU - a nonprofit associa-
tion of 62 U.S. and two Canadi-
an public and private research
universities - Incuses on
developing and implementing
better national and institution-
al policies related to research
and scholarship, graduate and
professional education, under-
graduate education and public
service in research universi-
ties.
Coleman has also been on the
board of directors of Johnson &
Johnson, a pharmaceutical com-
pany based in New Jersey, since
2003.
As stated on the company's
website, "Having served as pres-
ident of two of the nation's larg-
est and most prestigious public
universities and having a long
and decorated career in the sci-
ences, Dr. Coleman brings to the
Company's Board a unique point
of view regarding organization-
al management and academic
research vital to a company com-
peting in science-based indus-
tries."
In 2010, The New York Times
questioned potential conflicts
of interest pertaining to Cole-
mauls position on the board.
Soon after, the University Medi-
cal School became the first in the
country to refuse drug company
funding in medical education
class, citing the need to elimi-
nate any biases.
Coleman said in a statement
that she intends to remain active
in advocating for higher educa-
tion, scientific research support,
and diversity at the national
level. As part of this involve-
ment, Coleman will serve on the
Board of Directors for the Soci-
ety for Science and the Public
and on the Advisory Committee
to the Director of the National
Institutes of Health.
Coleman also plans to remain
in Ann Arbor.
"We have always lived in col-
lege towns and there's really no
place like Ann Arbor. We did
not think twice about where we
wanted to call home after the
presidency," she said.
While Coleman and her hus-
band have purchased a home in
Ann Arbor, they will split their
time btween Michigan and Col-

orado, where their son and his
family reside.

The Coalition for Tuition Equality holds a "study-in" to protest tuition differences for undocumented students in the
Michigan Union Thursday.

public commentary section of
the meeting.
By the time Alvarez spoke,
most other attendees had already
left and the audience was almost
entirely tuition-equality advocates.
Almost all of the supporters wore
maize shirts with the remainder of
spectators wearing white t-shirts
with the name of the student orga-
nizations they represented written
across the front.
Alvarez, who only a day before
was arrested during the protest,
said tuition equality is part of
larger movement seeking the
inclusion of minorities at the
University.
"Every decision in our his-
tory in which this institution has
allowed a marginalized com-
munity equal access has only
strengthened our power and
broadened our perspectives as
lifetime learners," Alvarez said.
After his speech, the crowd
decided not to chant, but sang
a spirited performance of "The
Victors," instead.
Business junior Michael
Proppe, the incoming Central
Student Government president,
reaffirmed his support of tuition
equality during his speech.
In his final address to the
regents, Business senior Man-
ish Parikh, the outgoing CSG
president, echoed a speech by
former U.S. President John F.
Kennedy.
"Here at Michigan we have
never made ,decisions because
they're easy. We made decisions
because no matter what the
hurdles and obstacles, we make
them because they're the right
thing to do," Parikh said.

A student protests for tuition equality at the Board of Regents meeting in the
Michigan Union on Thursday.

"Just the rest of the freshmen
that I'm around, knowing that I
have a chance to come in and be a
leader for this team next year, I've
already experienced it," Robinson
said. "I feel like I haven't really
shown everybody what I can do on
the basketball court."

Robinson was the Wolverines'
silent threat on offense, averaging
11 points per game over the course
of the season. He gained more con-
fidence as the NCAA Tournament
started, posting double figures in
all but one tournament game and
tied a career-high in points (21)
against South Dakota State in the
second round.
Though Robinson wasn't Mich-
igan's most dynamic player on

offense, his size and athleticism
are what made him a likely first-
rounder in many NBA draft pro-
jections. Now that he's returning,
Robinson hopes to move from the
'4' to the '3' position in the offense
as his game continues to improve.
"We've always envisioned him
to be the '3' man," Beilein said.
"And this year was like, 'How do
we get our best five guys on the
floor as much as possible?' Just

like we did with (former guard
Zack) Novak. That was the plan
to try, and he can do it. There's no
question he can do it."
The return of the two freshmen
will most likely put the Wolverines
as a top-15 team in the preseason
- Michigan is returning eight
players on the 15-man roster and
is bringing in three ESPN 100 com-
mits despite the losses of Burke and
Hardaway.

Strike the drones
Michigan's legislature should put a ban on drone use
Last week, the Michigan State House of Representatives
began discussing legislation to limit the use of unmanned
aerial vehicles - better known as drones - by law enforce-
ment. The bill, proposed by Republican state Rep. Tom McMil-
lin, would limit the use of drones.in situations involving a search
warrant, stop police from using data inadvertently collected while
tracking a suspect and prohibit drones from being equipped with
weapons systems. Twenty-nine states are actively discussing drone
regulation, and three have already passed laws restricting use. Due
to drones' potential to violate privacy, Michigan's legislature should
establish a moratorium on their use.

Drone technology enables operators at a
command center to collect a variety of data
without an individual ever knowing - let
alonegivingconsentto asearch.Alaw enforce-
ment agency with unfettered access to drones
could potentially use them to watch even law-
abiding citizens without probable cause. This
would be a huge overstep of the government
into people's private lives. virginia, Florida
and Idaho have both passed drone legislation
similar to what's being discussed in Michi-
gan, limiting drone use to warranted searches.
While these limitations may be something to
look into in the future, Michigan's legislature
must take stronger action at this point.
Drones' potential to violate people's pri-
vacy-and civil liberties is far too great to be
put into the hands of local and state law
enforcement. Even with the legislation pro-
posed by McMillin, the use of drones would
still be allowed in conjunction with a search
warrant, as well as in ambiguously defined
"emergency" situations. The possible impact
of drones on residents' daily lives, even under
regulation, is not yet known. Michigan law-

makers should enact a moratorium (n the use
of drones by law enforcement for any situa-
tion for at least the next two years, using that
time to extensively study and determine the
role of unmanned aircraft in domestic situa-
tions and privacy implications.
In a report released in 2011, Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory detailed the
extent to which drones can track people and
vehicles, stitchingtogether thousands of hours
of video recorded over periods of days on end.
While it's easyto see the potential of drones to
improve the criminal justice system, misuse
could cause them to become potent weapons
for surveillance.
Michigan must lead the way in support-
ing civil liberty and privacy. The concept of
24-hour surveillance could one day be a real-
ity, violating key principles that our country!
was founded upon. Society often sacrifices
some bit of liberty for security, but letting law
enforcement use drones in their activities
without a warrant goes too far. Michigan's leg-
islature should ban drones until their effects
on privacy are known.

commonplace,
especially at auniversity that neces-
sitates high academic achievement.
We strive to be academically com-
petitive, though it comes at a cost -
literally and figuratively.
Adderall, the popular drug to
address effects of Attention Defi-
cit Disorder and abused by count-
less students across the nation, is a
schedule II controlled substance,
just like cocaine. Therefore, it's
not only extremely addictive, but
boasts a long list of dangerous side
effects ranging from hallucinations
to paranoia. However, undergradu-
ate and graduate students alike con-
tinue to pop Adderall like it's the
best thing since coffee - though
let's keep in mind that coffee is com-
pletely legal and doesn't warrant a
prescription.
As college students, we have a
tendency to abuse our bodies. We
chug coffee and energy drinks dur-
ing the week, head to the bars on
the weekends and sleep when time
allows - which is more or less never.
And now adding to this destructive
mix of caffeine, alcohol, sleep depri-
vation and stress are study drugs
- Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, the
works. These prescription drugs
are being used by students without
prescriptions to gain a competitive
academic edge.

Like Lance Armstrong and his
steroids, we now have college stu-
dents and their study drugs. Wheth-
er pulling an all-nighter, cranking
out a 15-pager or cramming for
finals, Adderall is viewed by many
as a quick fix - a necessary supple-
ment to being a successful student
in such a competitive environment.
Allison, a University student who
regularly takes Adderall before
heading to the library, gave me her
own perspective on the study drug
situation on campus. She explains,
"It puts me in the zone ... I can pull
out a 10-page paper in one night."
The immediate
effects are worth
it she says: "At the
moment, you feel At times
great, like every-,
thing is falling to recons
into place, that how fa
you are being so
productive." Willing
But she's also
quick to admit
the destructive
and very real consequences of using
such a powerful drug.
"Finals last year, I was taking 70
milligrams of Vyvanse every day ...
I became so anxious, had so much
anxiety, and basically had a break-
down by the end. You don't sleep;
you don't eat."
But even with the anxiety and
insomnia associated with such
drugs, students continue to use
them. They're easy enough to get a
hold of on campus, though not all
students are willing to drop the $3.
to $6 per pop, which is the price
range of a pill.
The concept of study drugs does
raise an ethical question. Doesusing
these stimulants to achieve aca-
demic success give some students
an unfair advantage over others? Or
do the harsh side effects counteract
any positive consequences associ-
ated with their use?

For example, is it fair that while
I'm silently chugging my fourth
cup of coffee at the library ready
to claw my eyes out, my peers are
popping Adderall next to me? I
don't believe I have the answer
to this question, but I can tell you
this: Americans as a whole are
quick to turn to prescription drugs.
As a society we seek the quick fix,
regardless of how dangerous the
side effects may be.
Rather than explorin& other
means of treatment such as therapy
or rehabilitation, Americans turn
to medication. We're living in a pill
nation, as NBC's
Today Show has
so cleverly coined
we need the United States.
. And the statistics
Sider jUSt are staggering -
as a nation, we're
r we re taking more pre-
to rgo. scription drugs
than ever before
- painkillers,
anti-depressants,
sleep aids, you name it.
Maybe it's just part of the
achievement- and success-driven
culture we live in. At every level of
society, this competitive tendency is
evident, whether as a student at the
University or a &rofessional on Wall
Street. We aim not only to achieve
what's expected of us, but to excel
and push ourselves to our breaking
points.
The millennial generation prides
itself on working and playing hard.
And though this can definitely be a
positive attribute, at times we need
to reconsider just how far we're
willing to go to achieve the super-
human goals we set for ourselves.
Academic success is important;yes,
but in the end, our health and well-
being is even more valuable.

Diminishing faith

When most people run for student gov-
ernment, they run on platforms like "greater
transparency" or "increased communication
between government and students." Now, I'm
not saying that those things aren't important,
but I wanted to do something different.
In my eyes, Central Student Government
representatives are student advocates, and as
student advocates, we must work with Uni-
versity administration to ensure that students
are getting what they need within the param-
eters we're given by the institution. When I
was a freshman livingin the residential halls
and a Peers Utilizing Leadership Skills for
Education sexual educator, I saw a need for
an increase in sexual health services on cam-
pus. Each night in East Quad Residence Hall
- back in the good old days - I would tape
condoms to my door, and when I woke up the
each morning, onlythe dry pieces of tape and
a lowly sign advertising condoms remained.
It became apparent that PULSE representa-
tives alone weren't meeting students' contra-
ceptive needs.
There are condoms free of charge all over
campus. There are a handful of student
groups, such as Sexpertise, Students for
Choice and PULSE that hand out condoms
throughout the semester. Any weekday, you
can walk up to the second floor of the Uni-
versity Health Service building and pick up
as many lubricated, un-lubricated, ribbed
or female condoms as you like. Although I
believe that these are excellent resources
on campus for students, they're simply not
accessible. Students need condoms on Satur-
day at 2 a.m., later that morning while waiting
for a hangover to pass or on Sunday after-
noon post-Angelo's. Students' sexual activ-
ity doesn't revolve around the hours UHS is
open, or when student groups are handing
out condoms in Mason Hall. Students need to
have condoms accessible to them 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, because that's when

life happens.
That's where I come in.
I started the "condom project" several
months ago when I realized this urgent need.
One in four college students has a sexu-
ally transmitted infection. We need to rec-
ognize that we're not immune to herpes or
gonorrhea. Having condoms in the residen-
tial hall vending machines gives students
access to contraception if or when they need
it. I began talking to administrators and
residential hall councils in November and
December. Although I was receiving positive
affirmations from residential hall leaders and
students, I had a hard time getting the admin-
istration and the Residential Hall Association
on board. After months of meetings and pre-
sentations, I had made little ground on turn-
ing this project into a reality.
When I ran with forUM for a CSG repre-
sentative seat, my peers and running mates
helped to re-affirm my faith in this project. I
became more dedicated and steadfast in my
request, unwilling to take no for an answer.
So when I ran, I told you I would get it
done. And I did.
While those small little white boxes that
are marked $1 in your residential hall vending
machine wasn't what I imagined for the imple-
mentation of this initiative, it's a start. I will
continue to work with administration to lower
the cost of vending machine condoms, advocate
for their placement in all vending machines on
campus and negotiate to ensure quality contra-
ceptives are available at your convenience.
So, next time you're stumbling into South
Quad Residence Hall at 3 a.m. or just happen
to be looking for a midnight snack in Bursley
Residence Hall, hit up the vending machines.
Be sure to grab some condoms, a Pop-Tart
and renewed faith in your student govern-
ment, because we get the job done - safely.

People often call me an ide-
alist. My friends, family
and teachers have grown
accustomed to
my sometimes
overly optimistic
views on what
American poli-
tics represent.
Although these
views may seem
romantic at
times, anyone PATRICK
who knows me MAILLET
understands my
passion for poli-
tics and aspiration to play a role in
U.S. policy. And yet, the older I get
and the more I see our republic at
work, the more disgusted I become
with what our once-great political
system has become.
Wednesday, our Senate decided
to overlook 90 percent of the Amer-
ican, electorate. Our Senate decided
that the campaign contributions of
a select few were more important
than what the people who elected
them wanted. And most impor-
tantly, our Senate decided that the
lives of 20 innocent children and
six teachers from Newtown, Conn.,
12 moviegoers from Aurora, Col.,
32 college students from Virginia
Tech University and the thousands
of other gun victims slain every
year throughout the United States
were less important than gaining
the support of the National Rifle
Association.
Amid shouts of "Shame on you!"
in the Senate Chamber by parents
of gun victims, the Senate failed to
pass a bill on Wednesday that would
enhance background checks for gun
buyers. Falling short of the neces-
sary 60 votes that would overcome a
filibuster, the Senate voted 54 to 46
and failed to pass a bill supported
by nearly 90 percent of Americans
including 50 percent of gun owners,
according to a recent Washington
Post-ABC News poll.

On Feb. 14, I wrote a column
about gun control and the regula-
tions needed to help prevent simi-
lar atrocities in the future. Written
roughly one month after the New-
town shooting, my column spoke
of how disappointed I was that
only two of the four core elements
of President Barack Obama's gun-
control agenda would likely be
passed by our divided legislature.
I realized that seemingly logical
regulations, such as banning high-
capacity ammunition magazines
and restrict-

for any wrongdoing in Washington
D.C., this colossal disappointment
was created with bipartisan sup-
port. Six Democrats, including Sen-
ate Majority Leader Harry Reid,
voted against the background check
bill cosponsored by Senators Joe
Manchin (D-W. Va.) and Pat Toom-
ey (R-Pa.). Worth mentioning are
the four Republicans who bravely
broke party line and joined the 50
Democrats who supported the bill.

Saving 'Rock and Roll'

Scottish twins, Craig and Charlie Reid, have been playing together for 30 years.

Charlie Reid talks

Daily Arts Writer
Leith, Scotland is a town of
immense historical significance
and, in 1962, that significance was
furthered with the birth of twin
brothers, Craig and Charlie Reid
- the duo that created The Pro-
claimers.
"We were always interested
in music from when we were
young, but we didn't start play-
ing until our mid-teens," Charlie
said. "We just became more and
more obsessed with it, I suppose,
until we got to the stage where we
wanted to do it professionally."
For a band that has created
such a legacy, however, The Pro-
claimers didn't immediately rock-
et to fame. The brothers spent a
lot of their free time writing songs
and trying to build up an act that
they felt they could take on the
road. Even though there wasn't
instant gratification, they worked
for many years in order to pursue
music professionally.
"The early part of. our career
was so stop-start," Charlie said.
"I think initially a lot of guys who
come out and make a record and

have some success and have some
following; you get insecure. You
think it is going to evaporate and
disappear. When it became obvi-
ous to us that it wasn't in the ear-
lier part of the 2000s, we felt we
really had something going."
For most siblings, spending as
much time together as The Pro-
claimers would have resulted in
a million fights, but for the Reids,
musicmaking is the family busi-
ness.
"We're twin brothers, so
we've spent our whole lives
together," Charlie said. "We
were in the same class at school,
we had the same friends, and
when we were young, we slept in
the same bedroom. Being with
my brother is more normal than
not being with him, you know?"
The two brothers fought a lot
when they were younger, Char-
lie admitted, but they got it out
of their systems before they
decided to make music. With
this mentality, The Proclaimers
have created nine studio albums,
garnering the UK Silver, Gold
and Platinum certifications.
Now, 30 years after the band
formed, The Proclaimers are
still together and releasing
music. Their next album, The
Very Best of The Proclaimers
is a compilation of some of the
band's favorite songs.
"For live shows, 'Sunshine

on Leith' has always been very
important to the fans," Charlie
said, "even though it's a ballad,
and it's quieter than a lot of the
other material we do. 'I'm On My
Way' has always been great, and
obviously 'I'm Gonna Be (500
Miles)' has been by far the big-
gest success we've ever had and
the biggest success we ever will
have."
Even though the band has
played many live shows, they like
to change it up, playing their hits
interspersed with other songs in
order to give the fans a different
show every night. Their cur-
rent tour takes them all over the
United States, including The Ark
in Ann Arbor.
"It's a great town; I like the
college towns in the U.S. gen-
erally," Charlie said, "But Ann
Arbor seems like a nice, friendly
place to me. The venue itself is
excellent; we've played there
once acoustically and two or
three times with a band, and I
really like it."
Looking forward, The Pro-
claimers want to keep writing
and making music, developing
their act and bringing fans a
truly unique live show.
"As long as we feel like we're
doing it justice, we'll carry on,"
Charlie said. "I hope they go
away from the show feeling bet-
ter than when they comein.

cityscape is ...
well, nothing short of breathtak-
ing.
Where have we heard that
one before? Surprisingly, "Bio-
Shock Infinite" 's opening is just
as exciting as the original 2008
release. Instead of sinking into
the murky deep that was Rapture,
we are instead rocketed off to the
floating paradise city of Colhmbia.
Both expose the worst of society's
4flaws; both exploit near-magical
mutations (now called "vigors"
instead of past games' plasmids)
,and mechanical behemoths - but
it's clear that "Infinite" is a new
adventure.
Taking control of ex-security
agent Booker DeWitt, the player is
tasked with journeying to Colum-
bia in search of a girl named
Elizabeth to "erase the debt," as
emphasized enigmatically over
and over again. The world that
unfurls upon arriving at Colum-
bia is beautiful in all of the right

cheery boardwalk-city yields to
a much more sinister underbelly
- a massive steampunk represen-

This hands-on review will
fail. Even with my most creative
analogies, it will fail to accurately
illustrate how mind-boggling it
is to pull some goggles over your
head, open your eyes and sud-
denly find yourself surrounded
by a new environment. And that's
what happens when you strap on
the sharpest of cutting-edge tech-
nology, the Oculus Rift, a head-
mounted display that sucks you
into a 3-D virtual world.
The Oculus Rift sent shock-
waves through the tech industry
after the device's meteoric crowd-
funding campaign on Kickstarter,
raising just shy of $2.5 million
and leaving enthusiasts reeling
with thoughts of its potential.
Being one of the lucky few that
actually own an Oculus Rift Dev
Kit, I can confidently say that
I've put it through the paces. I've
explored the bombastic gameplay
of "Team Fortress 2," floated in
space surrounded by flying cubes
and a looming planet, ridden a
medieval roller coaster and taken
flight Neo-from-"The-Matrix"
style, soaring over landscapes and
buildings. It's a great time for vir-
tual-reality enthusiasts as many
developers release free demos
online via forums for those with
developer kits to tryout.
There's a feeling in the air that
we're experiencing the ground
level of a new technology - not
unsimilar to the first cinemas or
television screens. A lofty claim,
sure, but one that doesn't feel
risky. If the Oculus Rift was a reli-
gion, evangelism would be a piece
of cake. Just have someone try
on the thing and you have a new
convert. So, what is it about the
Oculus Rift that almost entirely
avoids criticism from those who
have tried it? Let's start with a bit
of history.
So-called "virtual reality"
headsets have been around for

After Monday's attack,
officer killed at MIT

Massive manhunt
underway in
city on edge
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)
- A police officer for the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology has been shot and killed
at the campus outside of Bos-
ton, authorities said early Fri-
day. No arrests had been made
and a manhunt was on for the
shooter.
The officer was responding to

report of a disturbance Thursday
night when he'was shot multiple
times, according to a statement
from the Middlesex District
Attorney's office and Cambridge
police. It said there were no other
victims.
MIT said on its website that
police were sweeping the cam-
pus in Cambridge and urged
people to remain indoors until
further notice. People were
urged to stay away from the Stata
Building, a mixed use building
with faculty offices, classrooms
and a common area.

The shooting came little more
than three days after the twin
bombings on the Boston Mara-
thon that killed three people,
wounded more than 180 others
and led to an increase in security
across the city.
The shooting took place about
10:30 p.m. outside an MIT build-
ing, according to state police
spokesman Dave Procopio.
The officer, who was not
immediately identified, was
taken to a hospital where he
was pronounced dead from his
wounds.

Pakistan sees first
transgender candidate

Historic election
marks progress.
for stigmatized
community
KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -
When Bindiya Rana, a trans-
gender candidate in Pakistan's
elections, went door to door in
the Karachi slum she hopes to
represent, few people seemed
to care about which gender
she identifies with. They were
more interested in what she
was going to do to combat the
street crime and electricity
outages in their neighborhood
if elected.
For the first time in Pakistan's
history, transgender people
are running as candidates. The
development marks a sign of
progress for transgender people
in this conservative country,
where they have long been met
by abuse.
Transgender refers to peo-
ple who present themselves to
the world, in.a way that does
not correspond with their sex
at birth. In Pakistan, that usu-
ally means people born as men
who now dress like women and
wear makeup. They identify as
a "third gender" rather than as

male or female but usually ask
to be referred to by the feminine
pronoun since there is no third-
gender pronoun.
Rana has always been active
in her community and works at
an organization that helps pro-
mote the rights of transgender
people as well as street chil-
dren and other social issues.
But she decided to run for
office as well after a Supreme
Court ruling in 2011 allowed
members of the transgender
community to get national
identity cards recognizing
them as a separate identity -
neither male or female - and
allowing them to vote.
She's vying for a provincial
assembly seat in the May 11
national elections.
"People ask if we will win or
lose in the elections. But I won
when my nomination papers
were submitted," she said.
The Supreme Court's deci-
sion didn't explicitly say that
transgender people could run for
office, but by getting the identity
cards and the right to vote the
road was opened for them. Before
the court's decision, transgender
people could get identity cards
only if they identified themselves
as men.
Almas Boby, president of the
Pakistan Shemale Foundation,

which advocates for members of
the transgender community, said
she knows of at least five trans-
gender candidates taking part
in the elections. Two, including
Rana, are running in the south-
ern port city of Karachi, and one
each from the cities of Jehlum,
Gujrat, and Sargodha in Punjab
province.
"The Supreme Court of Paki-
stan gave us our rights. Now
transgendered people are also
contesting elections, and our
thousands of people will vote for
them," Boby said.
"If our people manage to
reach assemblies, we will get a
better treatment in society," she
said.
Male and female roles are
clearly defined in Pakistan, and
transgender people often face
harassment and abuse - even
from their own families. Some
are pushed out of the home when
they are young and end up pros-
tituting themselves to earn a liv-
ing.
One role where they are
tolerated is as dancers at wed-
dings and other celebrations
at which men and women
are strictly segregated. In
between the dancing and
showers of rupee notes, they
must fend off groping from
drunken guests.

dents to gauge support for a fee to
support the renovations. Around
two-thirds of respondents indi-
cated that they would support the
implementation of a surcharge.
The University created the
nation's first student recreation
program in 1928. The Michigan
Union is the third oldest build-
ing of its type in the nation. It
has served as the backdrop for
multiple historic events, includ-
ing President John F. Kennedy's
speech that inspired the creation
of the Peace Corps in 1960 and a
discussion lead by Martin Luther
Kingon civil rights in 1962.
Caroline Canning, president
of LSA Student Government,
encouraged the Board to approve
the proposal as a crucial step in
restoring campus interconnect-
edness and improving spaces,for
students to develop leadership
skills and relationships.
During public comments, Can-
ning teared up as she addressed
the significance of her University
experience. She expressed her
hope that these renovations can
provide spaces for personal devel-
opment of future students.
"We need to invest in the brick
and mortar that make our college
experiences so unique," Canning
said.
After the projects were
approved, Canning said she was
excited for what the renovations
will bring to University students
in the future. Although Canning

will graduate this year, Build-
ing a Better Michigan will work
with the administration to use
students' ideas for the renova-
tions.
"Spaces on campus aren't just
spaces; spaces are where col-
lege experiences really unfold,"
Canning said. "We want to keep
the historical nature of these old
buildings, but I think the mod-
ern Michigan student deserves
more."
Canning added that, over Fall
Break, she and other members of
Building a Better Michigan trav-
eled to Ohio State University and
Purdue University, among oth-
ers, to gain inspiration from their
unions and recreational centers.
Susan Pile, director of the
Michigan Union, said the focus
of the Union renovations would
be increasing collaborative spac-
es for students with particular
attention to the needs of orga-
nizations. While renovations to
Mitchell Fields and other recre-
ational facilities are scheduled to
begin next summer, an architect
will be selected for the Union
article in the next year.
"I think it will be spaces that
really play into the tradition of the
Michigan Union but taking them
a step further and the innovative
experience we have at Michigan
and how that can be developed
within the Union itself," Pile said.
A great deal of the work will
focus on updating the Union's
nearly 95-year-old piping, elec-
trical systems and infrastruc-
ture. Pile added that it's unclear
whether the Union can remain

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
open during the renovation pro-
cess given safety concerns. It
is also unknown what impact
the large-scale renovations will
have on the vendors in the base-
ment.
Regent Denise Ilitch (D)
expressed her excitement for
supporting, the renovation after
comments from Canning and two
other students.
"Your positions and words
made a big difference," Illitch
said. "It mattered that a lot (stu-
dents) came forward and said
they would support this. Unions
are so vibrant. They are our life-
blood and I'm so excited our stu-
dents take such pride in it."
* Regent Julia Darlow (D) said
students receiving need-based
financial aid will have the student
fee covered by aid packages.
Regent Andrea Fischer New-,.
man (R) expressed concern about
adding a student fee to fund the
Union project.
She said there are many other
facilities on campus that require
repairs and said she would not
support the fee for students with-
out searching for other funding
possibilities, though she supports
the Union renovation process.
"If the students have a choice,
then I would be more comfort-
able," Newman said.
Regent Mark Bernstein (D)
said unions are as much a part of
the University experience as resi-
dence halls and academics.
"I grew up in this building and '
I don't distinguish this project
from the academic enterprise of
the University," Bernstein said.

Streaking Wolverines
ready for Wrigley Field

An empty jersey in the dugout
has inspired Michigan on run

By ALEX TAYLOR
Daily Sports Writer
The winds of change are blow-
inginthe BigTen.
Not only will the Michigan
baseball team (7-2 Big Ten, 21-14
overall) be looking to extend their
10-game win streak this weekend
when it takes on Northwestern
(4-8, 15-13), the Wolverines will
also play Saturday's game at his-
toric Wrigley Field, home of the
Chicago Cubs.

Michigan
is currently tied with Minnesota
atop the Big Ten standings thanks
to back-to-back series sweeps
against Michigan State and Penn
State. The Wolverines also got
some help when the conference
frontrunner, Indiana, was swept
by Michigan State last weekend.
In the Big Ten preseason coaches
poll, Michigan wasn't listed in the
top six teams in the conference.
The pitchingstaffhas played an
important role in the Wolverines'
recent run. Since the beginning
of Big Ten play four weeks and
13 games ago, Michigan's pitch-
ing staff has held opponents to
two runs or fewer in every game,
except for three games in which it
allowed three.
"Our pitching coach (Sean

Junior outfielder Michael O'Neill is one of a quintet of hitters powering Michigan.

Kenny) is one of the best in the
countuy at what he does," Bakich
said. "The players have all bought
into the philosophy. It's nothing
different than we've been preach-
ing all year, which is quick tempo
and forcingcontact."
Besides executing this strat-
egy, the pitchers are also get-
ting support from the defense. In
the 10-game winning streak, the
defense has committed just 10
errors while producingsome web-
gem moments.
"The (pitchers) are just pound-
ing the strike zone and letting
the defense make plays," Bakich
said. "The pitching staff has a ton
of confidence right now, knowing
they can attack the strike zone."
As the pitching staff has
recieved much of the attention,
the offense has flown under the
radar. During the winning streak,
the Wolverines have outscored
opposing teams 54-13. A quintet
of hitters has led the charge, com-
prising outfielders senior Patrick
Biondi, junior Michel O'Neill and
sophomore Zach Zott, as well as
freshmen infielders Travis Maez-
es and Jacob Cronenworth. With
the exception of Maezes, who
is hitting .297, all have a batting

average north of.300.
A strong Northwestern pitch-
ing staff will test the hitters this
weekend. As a team, the Wildcats
have a paltry 3.14 earned-run aver-
age. Northwestern is carried by
sophbmore Brandon Magallones,
fifth-year senior Zach Morton and
senior Luke Farrell.
Farrell - the son of Boston Red
Sox manager John Farrell - is the
projected starter for the Saturday
game. Longtime baseball expert
Peter Gammonstweeted aboutthe
matchup between him and O'Neill
earlier this week. Besides having
connections to the major leagues
(O'Neill is the nephew of former
New York Yankee Paul O'Neill),
both of these players are projected
to be drafted in the early rounds of
this year's MLB First-Year Player
draft.
Besides boasting a solid pitch-
ing staff, Northwestern also has
several strong hitters in junior
Kyle Ruchim and senior Jack
Havey. Ruchim carries a .418 bat-
ting average into the weekend
while Havey has a.389 average.
"They are a team that has been
a little bit of up and down," Bakich
said. "When they play well, they
can certainly sneak up on you."

when the all-around champion
will be determined. Their rota-
tion order will advance from
uneven bars to balance beam, a
bye, floor exercise, vault and a
second bye. If Michigan places
among the top three teams in
its session, it will advance to the
Super Six to vie for the national
team title on Saturday. Individu-
ally, the top four competitors on
each event from each semifinal -
ties included - will be invited to
the event finals on Sunday.
With a long weekend ahead,
the team simulated back-to-back

consecutive Big Ten Net-
wins, No. 10 work
Michigan holds
the longest current streak in the
country. It also has 13 consecutive
wins against Big Ten opponents -
its best streak versus conference
foes since 2010.
Iowa (4-8 Big Ten, 24-16 over-
all) has certainly played better
softball than a season ago. It has
beaten six ranked opponents this
year, including then-No. 15 Stan-
ford and No. 24 Oregon, but the
Hawkeyes have struggled since
Big Ten competition began. When
they have lost, it has been because
of their inabilityto score runs - in
14 of their losses, they've scored
three runs or fewer.
When their offense gets going,
though, it's largely in partto soph-
omore Megan Blank. Blank, who
was named the Big Ten Player of
the Week on Monday, is hitting
.440 with 49 RBL
In the circle, Michigan will
likely see a lot of junior right-
hander Kayla Massey. Massey has
pitched the bulk of Iowa's innings
this season while posting a 2.52
earned-run average and striking
out 82. She can hit, too, owning a

.322 batting average for the year.
The Wolverines have handled
opposition.well throughout their
current winning streak, though,
winning several games in come-
from-behind fashion.
"This team is all about fight,"
said senior third baseman Amy
Knapp. "We attack, we fight and
that's my favorite part about this
team."
Offensively, Michigan (13-0,
36-7) is putting up some record-
breaking numbers. Last Friday
in its first game against Michi-
gan State, the Wolverines scored
21 runs - setting a new record
for most runs scored in a Big Ten
game.
Senior second baseman Ashley
Lane has been a big help in the
lineup all year. She crushed her
11th home run of the season on
Tuesday against Indiana - her
40th career blast - putting her in
a tie for fifth place for most home
runs in Michigan history.
At this point in the schedule
last year, the Wolverines had four
more losses in three fewer games
and had dropped a game to a Big
Ten opponent.
This year, freshman shortstop
Sierra Romero, who received her
fourth consecutive Big Ten Fresh-
man of the Week award earlier
this week, and freshman left field-
er Sierra Lawrence have provided
a big boost in the lineup and in the
field. The two have hit .412 and
.377 this season, respectively, and
own a combined 83 runs scored -
more than half of what opponents
have scored against Michigan all
year. Defensively, Romero leads
infielders on the team with 103
assists, while Lawrence leads out-
fielders with nine.
Historically, the Wolverines
have had trouble with the Hawk-
eyes. Iowa is the only Big Ten
team that leads the all-time series
against Michigan, 50-54-1. But
past records, Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins will assure you, mean
nothing now, as the Wolverines
look to extend their streak to21.

Sophomore Sachi Suglyama and the Wolverines have their eyes on the Super Six in Los Angeles this weekend.

fight song," Plocki said. "Because
if we can do this at nationals,
then that's what we're going to
be singing when we're up on the
podium."
After just missing qualifica-
tions for the NCAA Champion-
ships in 2012, the Wolverines
have a renewed focus on the
quality of their gymnastics. Col-
lectively, the upperclassmen are
excited to return to nationals
while the freshmen and sopho-
mores are ready for the new
experience.
"This season has really shown
me what college gymnastics is
about, especially how fun it is and
just how exciting it is to compete
with a full team that has such a-
deep lineup on every event," said
sophomore Sachi Sugiyama. "It's
definitely put a different kind of
pressure on me in comparison to
last year, where I was just put in
the lineup because I was one of

the only ones ready to go."
Seniors Natalie Beilstein,
Brittnee Martinez and Katie
Zurales - three former NCAA
All-Americans - lead the squad.
Along with junior Joanna Samp-
son, the NCAA Northeast Region
Gymnast of the Year, Michigan
certainly has the talent and abil-
ity to reach the Super Six for only
the 11th time in history.
"We're there, but we still have
work to do," Plocki said. "We
haven't had our best meet of the
season yet. Everyone has to dig a
little bit deeper. We're referring,
to these days as 'practice oppor-
tunities.' During that two-day
intrasquad, we did a great job of
being focused, paying attention
to details and had a much bigger
sense of urgency. There's a qual-
ity to what we're doing."
Michigan has an advantage
over some of its competitors, hav-
ing already competed at Pauley

Pavilion in aquad meet, where it
scored its season-best 197.550 on
March 10, defeating No. 6 UCLA,
California and Iowa State.
"You can come into the gym
and visualize yourself at the
venue," Zurales said. "As you're
going through your routines, you
know what it feels like."
Plocki has a new quote each
week. Her final one reads, "Suc-
cess is the sum of small efforts
repeated day in and day out."
By continuing to do what
they've been doing in practice
and competition from week to
week, the Wolverines, who have
been ranked No. 1 in the country
twice this season, look to qualify
for finals.
"They're certainly not over-
confident, but they're confident
enough to believe that they're
going to be competing on Satur-
day at four o'clock in the Super
Six," Plocki said.
