More 
than 
70 
Michigan 
dispensaries 
operating 
under 
temporary licenses were forced to 
shut their doors at the beginning 
of 2019. In compliance with a set 
of bills passed in 2016, reforming 
the way the state regulates the 
production and sale of medical 
marijuana. The result was a 
shortage in medical marijuana, 
plaguing many areas in Michigan 
including much of Ann Arbor.
Ann Arbor is home to 20 
dispensaries, only seven of which 
have official licenses. Kinesiology 
junior L.J. Horowitz, a member 
of Green Wolverine’s founding 
executive 
board, 
estimated 
Ann Arbor has one of the 
highest 
densities 
of 
official 

and total medical marijuana 
provisioning centers in the state. 
Green Wolverine is a student 
organization focusing on the 
cannabis industry. 
“It’s great for students and 
great for people who live in Ann 
Arbor, but that’s by far the most 
besides Detroit in any city in 
Michigan,” Horowitz said.
When the shortage hit, Ann 
Arbor residents and business 
owners were disproportionately 
affected. 
Lisa 
Conine, 
community outreach coordinator 
at provisioning center Om of 
Medicine, described the scarcity 
as frustrating, saying patients 
were ridden with fear over what 
was to come.

Ustadh Ubaydullah Evans, 
Scholar-in-Residence 
at 
the 
American Learning Institute 
for Muslims, opened the Sacred 
Time Project 2019 — an annual 
weekend conference sponsored 
by 
the 
Muslim 
Students 
Association — Friday afternoon 
in the Rackham Amphitheatre 
with a session called “The 
Faithful 
Servant: 
Rooting 
Service in Tradition.” 
“I embraced Islam about 
20 years ago,” Evans said. “I 
converted when I was 16 … so 
when I encountered Islam, it 
was 
this...uncompromising 
monotheism that really drew 
me to the faith.”
Evans’s talk was one part of 
the Sacred Time Project, which 
ran Jan. 25-27. The conference 
included two main speakers — 
Evans and associate professor 
Su’ad Abdul Khabeer — as well 
as full-group sessions and other 
workshops and activities.
LSA 
sophomore 
Areesha 
Shahab, who was a Sacred Time 
Project chair and took part in 
organizing the conference, said 
she hoped participants left the 
conference feeling empowered 
to be a servant within the 
community 
and 
feel 
more 
involved in the Islamic faith or 
spirituality.
“This year, we were super 
heavily focused on student 
initiative and the aspect of 
being a faithful servant to the 
community and just being a 

good servant,” Shahab said. “I 
just want people to leave feeling 
like, ‘Oh, I need to do more’ or 
‘Oh, I just need to get myself 
more involved in something.’”
During his session, Evans 
discussed his discovery of Islam 
and experience with his faith. 
He also talked about similarities 
with other faiths, but the 
uniqueness of Islam comes from 
recognizing Muhammad’s place 
as a messenger for God.

He said in the past, Islam 
used to debate the place of God. 
In the present day, however, 
Evans said negotiations focus 
around understanding religion 
in real time. He specifically 
noted the conference’s focus 
on 
examining 
Islam 
and 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
religion in the present day, 
which he characterized as a 
commendable quality of the 
program.

Evans then looked at the 
meaning of the term “servant” 
and what hierarchy entails. 
He said the Islamic model, 
as he understands it, is not 
about avoiding or disavowing 
privilege- rather, it is about 
helping those who are not as 
privileged 
and 
supporting 
equity.

On Friday morning, President 
Donald Trump signed a bill to 
reopen the government for three 
weeks, until Feb. 15. During the 
three-week period, Trump is 
attempting to negotiate with 
lawmakers for the Southern 
Border Wall. Ann Arbor and 
neighboring local governments 
took proactive measures to aid 
federal workers with payments 
and expenses accumulated if the 
federal government shutdown 
were to continue.
On Jan. 22, Ann Arbor City 
Council 
passed 
a 
resolution 
allowing federal workers to defer 
payments to the city for 60 days 
after the government shutdown 
ends.
Councilmembers 
voted 
unanimously 
to 
pass 
the 
resolution. Mayor Christopher 
Taylor introduced this resolution 
because he deemed it necessary to 
counteract the fiscal harm being 
inflicted by the government.
“As everybody knows, the 
federal 
government 
is 
shut 
down and that is a condition 
that reflects terribly upon good

from across the country to discuss 
freedom, justice and equality for 
the LGBTQ community. The event, 

hosted by the National LGBTQ 
Task Force, was held in the Detroit 
Marriott 
at 
the 
Renaissance 
Center with about 3,000 people in 
attendance. 
About 200 workshops and 50 
events were offered at Creating 
Change. Participants could also

On 
Friday 
afternoon, 
the 
University of Michigan’s Institute 
for the Humanities hosted a panel 
featuring Brooklyn-based artist 
David Opdyke, journalist Lauren 
Sandler, historian Tara Ward, and 
arts curator Amanda Krugliak 
to discuss the effectiveness of 
art as activism. The conversation 
centered 
on 
Opdyke’s 
new 
installation, titled “Paved with 
Good Intentions.”
The piece is a collection of 
vintage 
postcards 
of 
popular 
American sights that Opdyke 
painted over. The postcards are 
assembled together, forming a 
scenic landscape riddled with 
environmental catastrophes and 
chaos. 
Opdyke said he has always 
made his art for himself and about 
his passions, but he has recently 
started being more purposeful 
in his creation. He said art is his 
form of activism and he has chosen 
to use his talent to try to make an 
impact.
“I 
make 
it 
because 
I’m 
compelled to make it,” Opdyke said.

Researcher talks behavioral trends 
regarding American energy consumption
Lauren Knapp presents work on environmental attitudes in the face of global warming

Fifteen students, professors, 
researchers 
and 
community 
members 
gathered 
in 
Weill 
Hall Friday to listen to Lauren 
Knapp, a researcher at the Energy 
Institute, present discoveries on 
American behaviors and attitudes 
towards energy. 
Due to the increasing effects 
of 
global 
warming, 
Knapp 
believes it is important for energy 
consumers to be informed about 
the varying types of alternative 
energy sources.
“Arguably one of the largest 
challenges in society today is 
the pressing need for deep, deep 
energy 
prioritization,” 
Knapp 

said. 
The research, coming from 
a 
five-year 
survey, 
showed 
consumer concerns about energy 
affordability have decreased, and 
concern regarding energy’s effect 
on the environment has increased 
significantly over the past five 
years.
For a little over five years, 
the Energy Institute has been 
working in collaboration with 
researchers at the Institute of 
Social Research (ISR), the world’s 
largest academic social science 
survey and research organization, 
to create an all-purpose study that 
looks into the human concern 
about the environmental impact 
of energy usage.
The two institutes developed 

energy-related questions to add 
to the University of Michigan 
Survey of Consumers, and in the 
fall of 2013, the Energy Survey 
was released.
The survey has run quarterly 
for five years, taking place in the 
fall, winter, spring and summer. 
Utilizing a random-digit dialing 
procedure, researchers gathered 
data from adult men and women 
respondents from all over the 
country. 
Approximately 
500 
households were asked a series 
of 18 questions regarding their 
attitudes toward energy.
John DeCicco, a research 
professor at the Energy Institute 
and director of the Energy 
Survey, said the survey really is a 
“psychology-based survey,” as it 
studies attitudes more than 
statistical data.
“We ask pretty broad 
questions about people’s 
feelings about energy, it’s 
really 
about 
attitudes,” 
DeCicco said. “We ask how 
people feel about the cost of 
energy, or how affordable 
they feel it is. Then, we 
ask 
people 
about 
their 
thoughts on the reliability 
of energy and about the 
environmental impact of 
energy, or how much they 
think energy impacts the 
environment.”
After five years of data, 
DeCicco, 
Knapp 
and 
Sarah Mills, senior project 
manager at the Ford School 
of Public Policy, began 
to analyze the array of 
feedback. Knapp specifically 
looked into the outpouring 
of responses in relation 
to the societal value that 
Americans place on coastal 
energy, transportation and 
nature-based infrastructure 
systems.
Within 
her 
findings, 
she looked into the social 

costs and benefits derived from 
the multitude of wind energy 
developments in the U.S.
Knapp 
then 
noticed 
that 
depending on one’s regional 
location, their concern toward 
energy 
on 
the 
environment 
varied. In a recent investigation 
done by the Pew Research Center, 
researchers found those living 
in coastal areas place greater 
importance on the problems 
associated with climate change. 
The study also found different 
energy prices and affordability 
programs might also play a role in 
this association.
DeCicco said the next question 
in the research would include 
how these findings will change 
human behavior.
“The next kind of question 
is does the concern for the 
environment translate in any 
way to them acting differently,” 
DeCicco said. “Is it a general 
concern where they don’t do 
anything about it. Or does it 
motivate them to change their 
behavior in some way?”
One 
of 
the 
behaviors 
consumers 
of 
certain 
utility 
companies are adopting is to pay 
an extra eight cents extra per 
kilowatt hour on their electric 
bills to get renewable energy. 
These include wind power or 
solar power alternatives provided 
by local utility companies. To 
DeCicco’s knowledge, there are 
no programs like this currently 
found in the state of Michigan.
So far, green pricing programs 
serve 597 counties across 24 states 
according to the researchers’ 
PowerPoint. Some of the top green 
pricing utilities include Portland 
General Electric, PacifiCorp and 
Austin Energy.

When the trailer for the 
movie “Us” came out on Christ-
mas Day, it seemed to shake 
up the nation. Not only did the 
film itself just look horrify-
ingly good, but it was also very 
refreshing for Black people 
around the country.
After many questions about 
the film’s premise, Jordan Peele 

has stated that the film has 
nothing to do with with race, 
contrary to his Oscar-winnin-
gOscar winning 2017 film Get 
Out. At a screening of the Us 
trailer, Peele told the audience 
that it was very important for 
him “to have a Black family 
at the center of a horror film”. 
Black people in this genre are 
very rare to see, so having an 
entire black family as the cen-
ter of the film is exciting. 

Courtesy of Universal Pic-
tures
Having Black main charac-
ters of any film will send the 
masses of the Black population 
running into the theater spend-
ing their coin out of support. 
But this film, in particular, in 
particular is refreshing because 
of the fact that the main 
characters are what seems to 
be a normal Black family. We 
are so used to seeing Black fam-

ilies with a parent missing (usu-
ally the father) because they 
are in jail or just missing for a 
reason that is never explained. 
Sometimes we see a single Black 
mother who has been made into 
the popular Black stereotype of 
the “welfare queen”. When we 
do see a middle class, nuclear 
Black family, there seems to be 
one family member (usually the 
daughter) who is unrealistically 
lighter than the rest of the fam-

ily.
Based off of the trailer, the 
film Us will feature a dark-
skinneddark skinned, middle-
classmiddle 
class 
suburban 
family who is able to be friends 
with white people while still 
listening to music such as The 
Luniz’s “I Got 5 On It” during 
family time. This is extreme-
ly refreshing for 21st century 
Black families who live in the 
suburbs and, have white friends 

and acquaintances, but are also 
still very aware of their Black 
identities. 
While I do think that it is 
important for there to be mul-
tiple representations of Black 
people in televisions and mov-
ies just like how there are in 
real life- the good, the bad, and 
the ugly- I think that this movie 
will be a positive representa-
tion of how a lot ofmany Black 
people live today.

What are the places 

that have molded 

you into the person 

you are today?

At the beginning of each 
of my semesters at Michigan, 
I’ve consistently felt the same 
uncomfortable 
cacophony 
of 
emotions. On one hand, I’m 
thoroughly bored by the end 
of break and am pining for the 
semester to start. I feel excited 
about the thought of getting 
back on campus, seeing lots of 
old friends, meeting new people 
and also getting busy again. But 
then as the first day of classes 
comes around the corner the 
feeling of excitement is often 
replaced with stress and anxi-
ety as I start to remember what 
a busy college semester feels 
like and how meeting new peo-
ple proves to be harder than it 
sounds.

The transition between break 
and a busy college semester usu-
ally starts with the awkward 
round of icebreakers that one 
is bound to participate in the 
majority of their classes. This 
is usually when you get to find 
out interesting facts and talents 
about your peers such as “I like 
hummus”, “I’m double-jointed 
almost everywhere in my body” 
or even “I learned how to ride a 
bike without training wheels”.
Like many on campus, I have 
spent the last few days trying to 
make my “fun fact” something 
that will make people laugh 
at the moment, but also some-
thing that people won’t strictly 
remember me by. But during 
these painstaking ice break-
ers, one question that is a little 
more difficult for me to answer 
is “Where are you from?” This 
is usually a question that people 
don’t struggle with, but person-

ally it means a lot more than 
just the name of the city where 
I was born or where I went to 
high school. It means: what are 
the places that have molded you 
into the person you are today?
Ann Arbor, Michigan and 
Bangalore, India are two places 
that are very dear to me. I have 
lived the majority of my life 
in Ann Arbor, but I can confi-
dently say that I wouldn’t be 
the person I am now without 
the three years I lived in India. 
In fact, looking back at it, as a 
first generation Indian-Amer-
ican immigrant, it meant a lot 
to me to have my own experi-
ence with India. Prior to that, 
hearing stories from my parents 
about their childhood, eating 
the Indian food my mom makes, 
waking up at 6 a.m. to talk to 
my grandparents and cousins 
on the phone and summer vaca-
tions to India were the extent 

of my cultural exposure. But 
living in India really allowed 
me to relate to my family in a 
way that I hadn’t been able to 
before. It made it possible for 

my parents to share a lot of the 
same experiences that they had 
growing up in India. My parents 
showed me where they grew up, 
I participated in a lot of tradi-

tional festivals and holidays and 
I got to see my family a lot more 
often than I had before. Living 
in India gave me the opportu-
nity to explore my heritage in a 
way I wasn’t able to before.
It wasn’t really until after I 
moved back to Ann Arbor that 
I slowly started to realize the 
importance and the significance 
of my Asian-American identity. 
Before I moved, Ann Arbor was 
the only home I knew. In fact, 
while I was terribly homesick 
during my first month there, I 
made it very clear to all of my 
classmates that I bleed maize 
and blue. However, when I 
moved back three years later, I 
realized Bangalore had become 
a part of me that I couldn’t 
get rid of. I couldn’t pretend 
that I had never moved there. 
After all, I came back with a 
thick Indian accent and a com-
pletely different personality. It 

was the first time that I had to 
come to terms with and accept 
my cultural identity for it’s the 
one thing that makes everyone 
themselves and unique.
All of this would be really 
difficult and maybe even bor-
derline overkill to explain in 
an icebreaker on the first day 
of class. But the next time it’s 
my turn, I probably won’t try 
to make mine as short as pos-
sible in order to get to the next 
person. Sometimes what may 
seem like a “simple question” 
deserves a complicated answer 
and can reveal a lot about a per-
son. So please, if you have to 
take a couple of extra seconds 
during an ice breaker that’s 
already been going on for too 
long to represent where you’re 
from, please take them. We’re 
all ears.

Where are you from? It’s complicated

Why the “Us” Trailer is so refreshing for 
Black families

I guess looking up at the stars you get a sense of something much bigger 
than yourself.
You realize that in the grand scheme of things you’re not much but a speck in 
the universe.
But yet you sit and think for hours a day on how to change the world, or at 
least yours 
You know time is socially constructed, but live and die by it.
Spending a lot of it on what I hope gives you a fulfilling feeling deep inside 
 Even in the moments that you wish you could get back, because you believe 
it was time wasted, but in reality it wasn’t because here you are right here, 
right now. 
You start to realize that everything is connected, every small or big action you 
have done has put you in the exact spot you are in now.
Not a second too late, or early.
The butterfly effect starts to become very clear to you now.
So now you become mindful of every small action you do, hoping that at 
some point all the insignificant moments in your life start to culminate into a 
puzzle, if you will.
You live everyday with a limited perspective, until you have small epiphanic 
moments that broadens your perspective.
Ideals and situations that were once clouded, become clear as island water 
untouched by man.
Every breath you take, is much more refreshing because you realize the true 
value of every inhale and exhale.
The colors are more vivid, and purpose fuels passion.
The details of the hues become euphoric.
So now looking up at the night sky feels different, and the stars don’t feel so 
distant.
You realize that the grand scheme is made up of the small specks such as 
yourself,
And every person you come into contact with help you complete the bigger 
picture 
So the importance of traveling and meeting new people can’t be stressed 
enough
And having the right people around you is doubly as important. 
People come and go, and you have to learn a lesson from every situation 
you’re in.
The silver lining, is something I have an eye for; time doesn’t stop so we can’t 
stress trying to stop, reverse, or forward it
Every moment is a gift and a piece to your puzzle.

ith 
our stomachs 

full of popcorn and 
Buncha Crunch (the 

best movie snack combination), 
my brother and I drove home 
after seeing “On the Basis of 
Sex,” the story of now-Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Ruth 
Bader 

Ginsburg 
and 
her 
history-

changing 
case 
on 
gender 

discrimination 
as 
a 
young 

attorney. We began our usual 
movie debrief and analysis, 
discussing how the characters 
were depicted, what we loved, 
what we would have changed 
and how the film made us feel. 
It was everything we could have 
asked for in a film about RBG 
(besides the fact that Felicity 
Jones, who plays her, isn’t 
Jewish — but that is for another 
column). 

We could not get over how 

strong, soft and confident RBG 
was depicted in the film. We 
were so fired up and empowered 
by watching her story. So I 
asked my brother where he 
thought she got her sense of 
security and confidence. He 
thought it had to be from her 
supportive husband Marty, who 
believed in her, was her equal 
and stood beside her always. I 
thought she learned it from her 
mother, because, in the film, 
they gave us some background 
about her teaching Ruth to 
question everything. But then 
I thought her confidence could 
have come from a secureness in 
her skills, knowledge or talent. 
And if she didn’t believe in 
herself, was she just channeling 
the classic lesson: Fake it until 
you make it? 

Regardless of how RBG 

gained her confidence, she 
was a key leader in change and 
challenged the status quo in her 
own way. Ruth Bader Ginsburg 

harnesses soft energy, a type 
of spirit that is thoughtful and 
nurturing yet still comamands 
people’s attention. She is soft-
spoken, 
thoughtful, 
detail-

oriented and sensitive. With all 
of these soft traits she holds, 
she also has the confidence to 
implement them into her work. 
When picking the series of 
cases that made discrimination 
of gender illegal, she looked at 
the details and knew how to 
frame it to the Supreme Court. 
She knows the power of her 
skills, knowledge and gifts and 
uses them to create change. As 
of late, I have been trying to 
channel my soft energy because 
I, too, am one big softie.

I have always been pretty 

self-aware of my emotional 
intelligence, 
sensitivity, 

nurturing 
abilities 
and 

relationship skills. I thought 
this 
skill 
set 
could 
only 

be really beneficial in my 
personal life and caretaking 
for children or older adults. 
This past year, I became the 
president of my cooperative 
house without holding the 
stereotypical 
characteristics 

of a president. I didn’t have 
the intention of being a leader 
in my house, but by building 
strong relationships with my 
housemates over time, being 

passionate about the future 
of our house and being my 
authentic soft self, I was able 
to gain this position. Being the 
president continues to show me 
how my soft traits positively 
impact my leadership style and 
power.

So, if I am aware of my 

strengths, how do I gain the 
confidence to apply these traits 
and put myself out there to 
work toward positions that 
scare me or are further out of 
reach? How can I harness my 
soft energy the way RBG did 
in law school and continues to 
do today as a Supreme Court 
justice? RBG never changed 
herself or her style to gain a 
position in power. She is a great 
example of how feminine, soft 
people can lead without having 
an iron fist or hard, masculine 
energy. I’m lucky to have 
someone in power with whom 
I share identities: being a white 
Jewish woman and setting the 
path which she did not have 
before her. Perhaps due to her 
position in the world — the 
privileges she holds and her 
intersecting role as one of the 
few woman in a field dominated 
by men — she has been able to 
cultivate her confidence.

From now on, I am going 

to continue harnessing my 
soft energy and remember 
that it can positively impact 
my leadership and power, 
even if I have to fake it until 
I make it. I think that when 
we are confident in our own 
abilities, even if they challenge 
the 
stereotypical 
image 
of 

power, we can create change 
and lead those around us in our 
own way.

Soft energy is power

The first step to fighting climate change is thinking small
T

he summer of 2018 saw 

a 
popular 
collective 

movement 
from 

companies and consumers alike 

as they rallied against the use of 

plastic straws. Companies such 

as Starbucks began to announce 

the 
eradication 
of 
plastic 

straws from their practices. In 

large part, this movement was 

in response to a viral video 

depicting a sea turtle with a 

plastic straw caught in its nose 

that sparked a conversation 

between 
many 
online. 
This 

video (thats original upload 

amassed over 30 million views) 

provided the perfect spark that 

triggered a movement leading to 

the plastic straw apocalypse.

This is in large part because 

it is easy to enact change when 

the dilemma has a tangible (and 

cute) icon, like sea turtles, and 

puts a real face on the thing 

doing them harm: straws. In 

our country alone, we learned 

Americans 
use 
500 
million 

straws every single day. And so 

the story wrote itself — if you 

want to be environmentally 

conscious and do your part, all 

you need to do is forgo the straw 

and save a turtle! However, the 

sobering reality is that plastic 

straws only account for about 

0.02 percent of total ocean 

plastic — a quite literal drop in 

the ocean of plastic.

I don’t want to say this is a 

bad thing — quite the contrary. 

I am all for ditching the straw 

and “saving the turtle” at every 

opportunity. In fact, this is 

a good example of how non-

environmentally-minded people 

can 
support 
environmental 

causes when given the proper 

motivation. As great as this 

moment is, imagine if we could 

take the momentum generated 

surrounding 
plastic 
straws 

and apply it to other, larger 

environmental causes such as 

climate change — one of the 

biggest economic threats of 

our generation.

Truthfully, this tactic has 

already been tried to no avail. 

Growing up as a kid, I remember 

watching the documentary “An 

Inconvenient Truth” for the 

first time. Controversial for 

the era, the 2006 documentary 

highlighted and explained the 

problem of global warming and 

called its viewers to action to do 

something about it. Of the many 

stories and facts given during 

the film, the images that stuck 

with me the most were of polar 

bears swimming around, unable 

to find stable ice. The narration 

explained the melting of arctic 

ice was destroying these bears’ 

homes, and if global warming 

continued uninhibited, there 

would be no more polar bears.

This is the exact same kind 

of situation that led to the 

plastic straw craze over the 

summer: an innocent animal 

being harmed by the unintended 

consequences of human activity. 

Yet the campaign to save the 

polar bears failed to reach 

a more general audience in 

the same way. Perhaps that is 

because it was pre-social media, 

or that our generation is more 

motivated 
by 
environmental 

concerns 
than 
previous 

generations (both of which are 

reasonable, plausible answers 

to why there was not the same 

kind of movement then as there 

is today).

I would offer a third possible 

answer. 
The 
main 
reason 

everyday people are willing 

to forgo straws in the name of 

saving the environment is not 

due to some newfound respect 

for nature but rather a result 

of the ease of changing actions. 

Saving the polar bears implies 

drastically 
changing 
our 

lifestyle — mainly the reduction 

of fossil fuel consumption. And 

regardless if you hate fossil 

fuels, every single American 

benefits from how cheap and 

convenient these fuels are. Even 

as clean, renewable alternatives 

are rapidly becoming cheaper 

and more efficient, we are still 

rely heavily on fossil fuels.

Plastic 
straws 
and 
sea 

turtles, on the other hand, 

require a much simpler response. 

After all, unless you need them 

for medical reasons, refusing 

straws has little impact on our 

everyday lives. It’s much easier 

than trading in your gas guzzler 

and installing solar panels in 

order to save a polar bear. So the 

question arises: How can we get 

people motivated about climate 

change in the same way?

The 
answer 
to 
fighting 

climate change lies in breaking 

down a seemingly impossible 

monumental 
problem 
into 

everyday, small-scale decisions.

Take 
meat 
consumption, 

for example. According to the 

Environmental 
Protection 

Agency, livestock production 

results 
in 
greenhouse 
gas 

emissions, primarily through 

the 
natural 
production 
of 

methane. In order to make a dent 

in reducing carbon emissions, 

we are going to need to reduce 

the amount of meat we consume.

When most people hear that, 

they scoff and make a claim 

about how we are natural meat 

eaters, and how they would 

never go vegan. As frustrating 

as it is to hear people be so 

dismissive 
immediately, 
I 

cannot blame them. I consider 

myself an environmentalist, yet 

I still consume meat (I mean, 

Chick-fil-A 
nuggets 
are 
too 

good to pass up, right?).

The 
misconception 
here 

is 
that 
changing 
our 
food 

consumption needs to be a 

drastic, 
life-altering 
vow. 

Instead 
of 
trying 
to 
get 

everyone 
to 
go 
completely 

vegan, we should start by trying 

to make conscious, modest yet 

impactful choices to reduce our 

consumption. The aggregation 

of these small choices will result 

in a huge impact on climate 

change. For instance, if every 

American simply forwent meat 

just one day a week, it would 

be the equivalent of taking 7.6 

million cars off the road.

When 
framed 
this 
way, 

suddenly the impossible seems 

conceivably possible. After all, 

how much would it really cost 

us to drop the steak dinner once 

a week?

Even more exciting news 

is 
the 
development 
of 
the 

alternative 
meat 
industry. 

Products such as the Impossible 

Burger 
or 
Beyond 
Meat 

offer a meat alternative that 

tastes, feels and is otherwise 

interchangeable 
with 

traditional beef at a fraction 

of the environmental impact. 

Prices for these alternatives 

are already competing with the 

real thing. Pretty soon we will 

be able to save the environment 

while still getting our beef fix.

If we are going to make a 

serious dent in climate change, 

and 
save 
the 
polar 
bears, 

Americans will seriously need 

to reconsider their consumptive 

habits. Partaking in “Meatless 

Mondays,” 
while 
a 
great 

beginning, is not the be-all, 

end-all of climate solutions. Not 

to mention, fighting climate 

change is not solely a consumer-

responsible task (indeed, we 

will need larger institutional 

support as well). Changing a 

culture takes time, but we need 

to start somewhere, and if we 

focus on it there can be real, 

tangible change.

U-M needs an all-female work space

G

rowing up as a young 
woman means that you 
are constantly on display. 

Everywhere you go — at school, 
at the grocery store, at volleyball 
practice, at church, at the pool, 
even at home — you are always 
open to critique, comments or 
questions related to your body.

If it’s not, “Smile honey,” it’s, 

“Those pants are NOT flattering” 
or “Your bra strap is showing” 
or “Why do you have a ‘lesbian’ 
haircut?” And especially after 
the transition to young adulthood 
— though some girls experience 
this even before puberty — people 
view you through the lens of 
attractiveness. Whether it’s the 
creepy guy scanning you up 
and down at the gas station 
or the “I bet boys are all over 
you” comment at large family 
gatherings, 
your 
existence 

is always in proximity to the 
male gaze.

It’s not just men who do this 

to women, though. One of the 
biggest scams of the patriarchy 
is the system in which women 
are punished for breaking gender 
norms. Some women feel it is 
their duty to police other women 
according to those patriarchal 
norms. For many young women, 
it is often older (and more 
conservative, by way of their age) 
women who push notions of what 
is and is not “acceptable” in public. 
This creates an environment 
where women — young women 
especially — experience criticism 
from all angles, doubly so if you 
are a woman of color, LGBTQIA+, 
differently abled, etc.

It 
can 
be 
maddening, 

heartbreaking and downright 
rage-inducing to constantly field 
gendered and often sexist ridicule. 
Of course, the real solution to 
sexism is to dismantle the white 
supremacist 
heteropatriarchy, 

but what about right now?

In Fall 2016, The Wing, a 

community and co-working space 
designated for women, opened 
in New York City. Founder of 
The Wing, Audrey Gelman, 
developed the idea for a space 
just for women after spending 
her birthday at a girls-only party, 
realizing the importance of 
“ladies’ nights” for women.

Eventually, 
Gelman 

partnered with Lauren Kassan to 
open The Wing after finding that 
other co-working spaces couldn’t 
offer what they were looking for. 
Though they take inspiration 

from early women’s clubs in the 
19th and 20th centuries, Gelman 
and Kassen make inclusivity a 
priority by encouraging trans 
and non-binary folks, people of 
color and low-income women 
to apply for membership, even 
offering a scholarship to ensure 
it is accessible for everyone.

Partly for socializing and 

partly for working, The Wing 
offers much more than a typical 
work space, including events 
with speakers like politician 
Hillary 
Clinton 
or 
actress 

Kerry 
Washington, 
blowouts, 

showers, lactation rooms, a cafe 
and a daycare for women with 
children. Since the success of the 
first space in Soho, New York, 
the company has expanded to 
six other locations, including 
Washington, 
D.C. 
and 
San 

Francisco, and plans to open 
in five other cities including 
Chicago, London and Toronto, 
making a total of eleven Wings.

More than the amenities and 

chic decor, the Wing offers a 
space for women to exist outside 
all the ways in which women are 
marginalized. It’s not just about 
making a safe space for women, 
though. It’s about making a space 
where women are celebrated 
and can celebrate each other. A 
space for women allows women 
to create community through 
socializing with and supporting 
one another.

Gelman 
told 
business 

magazine Fast Company, “The 
air feels different when it’s 
only women. The atmosphere 
is incredibly warm, there’s an 
absence of competition or snark 
or cattiness. Everyone is just 
really excited to be here and to 
meet new people.”

I know the feeling, especially 

at the University of Michigan. I 
am a double major in Political 
Science and Women’s Studies, 
and I’m sure you can guess 
which 
classes 
are 
mostly 

women and which are not. In 
contrast to my male-dominated 
political science classes, my 
women’s studies classes are 
not just different in content but 
different in atmosphere. There 
is less tension in the air. People 
are friendly, understanding and 
supportive. No one interrupts 
you or mansplains to you. No 
one invades your personal space 
while pretending to be clueless 
about the whole thing. Everyone 
is considerate and professional. 

It is less a matter of social 
bonding and more a matter 
of just being treated like a 
human being.

It is difficult to articulate 

in words, like really any feeling 
is, but I feel a sense of comfort, 
a sense of ease in my bones 
when I am learning surrounded 
by women. I am no longer 
on display. I am no longer 
expected to perform — or risk 
punishment for breaking — 
social norms that cater to men. 
I can relax — opening myself up 
to new possibilities for learning, 
understanding and engaging.

There 
are 
also 
concrete 

learning benefits for women 
in all-female spaces. Nilanjana 
Dasgupta, a Psychological and 
Brain Sciences professor at the 
University of Massachusetts at 
Amherst, found that first-year 
women engineering students, 
“participate more actively” and 
“feel less anxious” when they are 
in mostly female or gender-equal 
groups.

An all-female work space 

would not be disrupting the 
many 
benefits 
of 
a 
co-ed 

university, such as a wider 
range of perspectives and the 
opportunity to learn to work 
in teams with other genders. 
An all-female work space at 
the University, inclusive of any 
female-identifying 
person, 

would 
simply, 
but 
notably, 

allow female students in a work 
environment free from gendered 
pressures and expectations, a 
place they can be re-energized in 
their academic pursuits by other 
women. Specifically, this space 
might take inspiration from The 
Wing by holding events centered 
around celebrating women and 
their 
achievements 
through 

hosting speakers or educational 
and social events, which would 
elevate the space from just being 
a refuge to being a space for 
empowerment.

College 
life 
outside 
of 

academic pursuits can be a soup 
of young people riddled with 
freedom, hormones and alcohol 
who are looking for hookups. A 
place for young female students 
to escape, to live even for just a 
few hours outside of the world 
that constantly undermines and 
undervalues 
their 
existence, 

would be transformative.

SUMMER EMPLOYMENT

The Michigan
Daily loves 
its readers
a LATTE

For a brief moment in mid 
’90s Tokyo, a new musical 
genre flourished and traveled 
around the world to the very 
countries that fed into its 
creation in the first place. 
“Shibuya-kei” was a patchwork 
of genres that borrowed from 
the 
previous 
decade’s 
city 
pop 
and 
everything 
from 
MPB (Brazilian pop), French 
chansons 
and 
’70s 
lounge 
music. The district Shibuya 
is an eclectic monument to 
consumerism in the best way 
such a description could entail, 
and Shibuya-kei reflects its soul.
Trying 
to 
recount 
the 
complex, fascinating history 
of the genre in just a few 
short sentences would do it a 
disservice, so I recommend 
checking out a brilliant article 
by Drowned in Sound for a 
primer. Keigo Oyamada, known 
as Cornelius, was one of the 
founders of Shibuya-kei’s most 
iconic bands, Flipper’s Guitar. 
His 1997 work Fantasma (which 
the article names as the genre’s 

“essential album”) is a result 
of his prolific solo career, and 
distills the essence of the genre 
he helped elevate into a cohesive 
yet chaotic album.
Interpol’s Turn on the Bright 
Lights (in my opinion, one of the 
best albums ever made), takes 
the listener on a tour of the 
city in the dead of night, when 
its seedy underbelly comes to 
the surface and when one can 
feel the crushing isolation it 
induces. 
Fantasma 
rewinds 
a couple hours before the 
comedown. Manic energy is 
abounding, and the night is still 
unpredictable.
Fantasma bounces around 
genres and time periods, with 
Cornelius paying homage to 
figures 
from 
Brian 
Wilson 
to ABBA, and injecting his 
homages with an infectious 
kitchiness. 
“New 
Music 
Machine” channels noise pop 
and shoegaze, reminding me of 
an amped-up version of Yo La 
Tengo’s “Sugarcube.” “Chapter 
8 
‘Seashore 
and 
Horizon’” 
feels like a warped Revolver-
era Beatles Track. “Star Fruits 
Surf Rider” somehow combines 
a Jungle-esque breakbeat and a 

beautiful orchestral interlude. 
“Clash” 
alternates 
between 
lying on a bed of bossa nova 
chords and bursting into a 
powerful chorus.
The album is an interesting 
case study on artistic influences. 
Like the Greta van Fleets of 
the world, Cornelius wears 
his unabashedly on his sleeve. 
Unlike the Greta van Fleets of 
the world, he synthesizes them 
into a compelling, inventive and 
most importantly, completely 
novel form. You can feel his 
admiration and love for the 
artists he channels without 
every getting the sense he’s 
making a hackneyed cover of 
any one of them.
Fantasma 
may 
veer 
into 
overtly cartoonish territory at 
times, but that’s what gives it 
its charm. Listening to it is like 
taking a peek into its creator’s 
colorful mind or like walking 
around Shibuya at night, with 
the neon signs illuminating 
the throngs of people around 
you and the cacophony of 
noises settling into a somewhat 
comfortable background. It’s 
overwhelming, sure, but it’s 
also incredibly exciting.

Like every other school night, 
I was surfing Netflix after 
completing work and stumbled 
across the show “Tidying Up 
with Marie Kondo.” The show 
follows 
Marie 
Kondo, 
the 
famed 
Japanese 
organizing 
consultant, 
as 
she 
helps 
families across America gain 
some semblance of order in 
their lives. Kondo is most 
famously known for her book 
called 
“The 
Life-Changing 
Magic of Tidying Up: The 
Japanese Art of Decluttering 
and Organizing,” which focuses 
on the technique she employs 
which has been dubbed as the 
KonMari Method. The essence 
of this particular method lies in 
her belief that every item that 
we own must “spark joy,” or in 
other words, elicit happiness 
from within us. If you think 
about that statement, it does 
make sense: Why should one 
keep something if it does not 
please them? I watched the first 
episode and was left absolutely 
enamored. Some part of me was 
even inspired to start my own 
cleaning drive in my room.
The 
KonMari 
Method 
is rather simple beyond its 
underlying 
ideology, 
and 
can 
be 
broken 
down 
into 
two 
key 
parts: 
discarding 
and organizing. The first is 
straightforward and essentially 
recommends getting rid of any 
and all things that contribute 
to the stress of our daily lives, 
but that does not necessarily 
equate to living a minimalist 
life. The second part requires 
us to visualise the final image 
and find an appropriate space 
for each item by categorising 
them according to type instead 
of location. However, the most 
important yet unsaid step is to 
be committed to tidying up the 
space, and to remember to do it 
all at once instead of breaking 
it into smaller portions. It isn’t 
rocket science, but it is hard 
work. After watching the show, 
I really wanted to try this out 
for myself. Let it be known: This 
isn’t something I or most people 
would normally have a desire to 
do. So the question that really 
arises is: Why is that? Why 
are we only motivated when 
something becomes so popular?

Marie 
Kondo 
and 
her 
ingenious ways of organizations 
are undeniably helpful and have 
been 
becoming 
increasingly 
popular ever since Netflix first 
released the show. The internet 
is filled with discussions on 
the KonMari Method, how it 
has changed people’s lives and 
that it’s the next big thing. 
There are countless articles 
analyzing 
the 
method 
and 
simplifying it further, which 
I found surprising for two 

reasons. The idea itself is self 
explanatory to a great extent 
and, as I mentioned earlier, it 
isn’t rocket science; it is simply 
the notion of building a habit 
that stays with us. 
Marie 
Kondo 
isn’t 
the 
first person that has tried 
revolutionizing the way we 
organize our lives, yet her 
way has now been turned into 
a movement and placed on a 
pedestal and as the ultimate 
way to get things right. I agree 
— it is indeed difficult to have 
everything in place all the 
time and having definite ways 
to go about doing so can make 
a difference. But are we really 
making that change? I love the 
show and how it not only shows 
the process of cleaning in such 
a clear manner, but the fact that 
they have remained true to her 
Japanese heritage and didn’t 
dub the language. It is indeed 
the small things that matter. 
However, 
I 
am 
beginning 
to 
question 
our 
immediate 
instinct to follow the popular 
trend, and this is not a new 
discussion. As a society, we 
have been asking this for a 
while now, and there is possibly 

no one answer, maybe it just 
boils down to human tendency. 
The problem lies in the fact 
that when we simply follow 
something because it’s popular 
or famous for that period of 
time, we learn it, but we don’t 
retain it.
I say this from a personal 
experience; I gave in to my urge 
and tried the KonMari method 
myself. The first time I did it, 
it was time-consuming, but it 
was fun. I enjoyed choosing 
between the gazillion pieces 
of clothing I own and asking 
myself whether that piece made 
me happy, and then folding it 
into tiny stackable rectangles. 
However, it wasn’t something 
that I would be able to keep up 
for more than a week. For those 
who do, kudos to you. You are 
a select minority that truly 
assimilated the technique into 
your lives. For the rest of us, 
the harsh truth (though we may 
not consciously agree) is that 
we probably did it to appreciate 
how aesthetic it looked for once 
and because it is the talk of the 
town right now. This time next 
week, the talk will be something 
else, and we will be trying that, 
already having forgotten the 
art of tidying up. We move from 
one idea, one trend to another at 
the speed of lightning. We are 
living in a world where sticking 
to one idea and completing it 
for an extended period of time 
is difficult. I believe that we 
need to possibly stop hyping 
ideas, trends and people, even, 
to such a great degree, and then 
just jump the boat. If we believe 
that something is truly worth 
the amount of attention we are 
giving it, we need to show it not 
through our articles or social 
media posts but by actually just 
continuing to do it. 
Given these thoughts, I still 
highly recommend watching 
the show on Netflix, for it is 
wonderful and does “spark 
joy,” and maybe even try your 
hand at tidying up your life in 
her way. Who knows, you might 
actually end up loving it and 
incorporating it into your daily 
life. In the process, you might 
just find the next revolutionary 
method 
of 
organizing 
our 
lives. If you do, let us all know, 
because I can already see the 
heap of clothes piling up at the 
back of my room.

STYLE NOTEBOOK
Is Kondo’s advice realistic?

PRIYDARSHINI GOUTHI
Daily Arts Writer

To want to change the world 
is not an uncommon ambition. 
Perhaps that explains why reflex 
responses to this sentiment are 
consolidating around the form 
of a dismissive grunt.
But what if, just this once, 
we paused and unpacked the 
aspiration before issuing a hasty 
dismissal? Then rescaled it to 
fit a cross-section of the world, 
and calibrated it according 
to the talents of its utterer, 
then, beyond that, situated it 
in a specific arena for enacting 
change, and, last but not least, 
launched wholeheartedly after 
that revised version of 
the phrase?
For the promising 
results 
of 
this 
experiment, 
see 
“On 
the 
Basis 
of 
Sex.” 
Mimi 
Leder’s 
(“The 
Leftovers”) 
biographical 
drama 
recounts some of the lesser-
known 
episodes 
of 
Ruth 
Bader 
Ginsberg’s 
(Felicity 
Jones, “Rogue One”) quest to 
dismantle 
legally-sanctioned 
gender-based 
discrimination, 
culminating in the case Charles 
E. Moritz v. Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue in federal 
appellate court. Now, as the 
end of the film coincides with 
Ginsberg’s victory in this court 
case, the film errs on the side 
of rejoicing excessively over a 
small victory part of a much 
larger, and at times much 
more brutal, struggle. But all 
the better to err on the side of 
building momentum in favor of 
social justice than on the side 
of overemphasizing the limits 
of 
minute 
accomplishments. 
The latter tactic runs the 
risk 
of 
ingraining 
despair; 
the former leaves audiences 
feeling eager to carry the torch 
and characterizes the chief 
impression “On the Basis of 

Sex” will leave on audiences.
To achieve this effect, the 
film reminds us that if you 
plan to change the world, first, 
you must live in it. Whether 
you’re taking it to the streets, 
the courtroom or even the 
kitchen as your family prepares 
dinner, you will not be granted 
reprieve from the injustice 
you’re striving to upend. The 
filmmakers capture Ginsberg’s 
endurance 
of 
sex-based 
discrimination in various parts 
of her world, from the dean of 
Harvard Law School’s (Sam 
Waterston, “Law & Order”) 
framing of her admission to law 
school as nothing more than his 
own noble gesture on her behalf, 

to an interviewer at a legal firm 
ogling her (concealed!) cleavage 
before turning her down.
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
film remains conscious that 
Ginsburg is one woman amid 
an entire nation’s worth. She 
is not the only one who seeks 
justice, and the film is not mired 
in her vision of change alone. In 
various scenes in her classroom 
at Rutgers, she solicits the 
perspectives 
of 
her 
young 
students, who hail from diverse 
backgrounds. At home, she spars 
with her daughter Jane (Cailee 
Spaeny, “Bad Times at the El 
Royale”), who places greater 
trust 
in 
civil 
disobedience 
and Gloria Steinem than in 
the law. And in the process of 
avoiding a myopic portrait of 
what the struggle for equality 
looks like, the film renders a 
surprisingly 
comprehensive 
historical 
atmosphere 
and 
defies the tendency of historical 
biographical dramas to lose 

themselves in the force of their 
main character and neglect 
their historical situation in 
turn.
“On 
the 
Basis 
of 
Sex” 
defies other expectations. It 
doesn’t, for example, flatten 
the characters secondary to 
the subject of its biographical 
lens. In particular, Spaeny’s 
performance of teenage Jane 
Ginsburg comes to mind. She 
challenges her mother’s chosen 
arena for effecting change, at 
one point accusing her mother 
of settling to inspire another 
generation of activists rather 
than taking matters into her 
own hands. Later, she questions 
how much legal change can 
accomplish compared 
to social movements. 
These 
tense 
scenes 
will undoubtedly leave 
audience 
members 
reevaluating 
their 
own ideals of social 
change. 
As 
a 
film 
that centers gender-
based discrimination, “On the 
Basis of Sex” also carefully 
avoids relying on tropes of 
female portrayals, especially in 
Jones’s portrayal of Ginsburg. 
Refreshingly, the filmmakers 
did not recycle the familiar 
dramas that working mothers 
and wives are often called to 
act out in film. Instead, the 
character simply lives her own 
unique story.
So, when next you hear 
someone say they want to 
change the world, think before 
you roll your eyes. Think of 
Ruth 
Bader 
Ginsburg. 
Or 
perhaps Jane Ginsburg. Better 
yet, picture an entire history 
of world-changing women and 
hear how powerful their voices 
are in chorus. And be grateful 
for the reminder “On the Basis of 
Sex” gives us, of the possibilities 
that await once we trade the 
complacency of cynicism for the 
humbling effect of a leap of faith 
and trust of self.

There’s something special 
about seeing a musician at 
their top of their game. While 
many musicians can perform 
extraordinarily 
difficult 
music, few can do so with ease 
and grace, making even the 
most complex of passages seem 
effortless.
At the André Mehmari Trio’s 
concert this past Saturday at 
the Kerrytown Concert House, 
Mehmari 
demonstrated 
his 
mastery of his instrument, 
both 
improvisationally 
and 
technically, 
as 
he 
moved 
flawlessly 
between 
styles 
and 
genres. 
From 
Afro-
Cuban influenced music to 
stride 
piano, 
from 
ballad 
to 
swing, 
Mehmari 
fired 
off 
quick 
improvisational 
passages and lengthy melodic 
improvisations 
without 
blinking an eye — and this in 
the first two songs alone.
Unfortunately, most foreign 
jazz 
artists 
performing 
in 
America are frequently forced 
to confront the prejudices held 
against the music of their home 
countries. They are forced 
to adapt to our stereotypical 
expectations, performing the 
music we expect of artists from 
their 
homeland. 
Mehmari, 
his bassist Neymar Dias and 
his drummer Sérgio Reze are 
from Brazil. At this concert, 
they 
performed 
the 
music 
of 
Brazilian 
artist 
Milton 
Nascimento from the 1972 
album “Clube de Esquina.” 
Yet, despite my expectations 
for 
primarily 
Brazilian-
influenced music, the concert 
drew from an eclectic range of 
genres and styles. As described 
in the program, this music 
draws influences from “pop, 
folk music, bossa nova, jazz 

and 
avant-garde 
classical.” 
It focuses not on stylistic 
continuity 
but 
on 
inter-
instrument dialogue and rapid 
improvisation.
If Mehmari’s goal was to 
transcend genres, he more 
than succeeded. At one point, 
for example, Dias switched 
from bass to viola caipira (a 
10-stringed Brazilian guitar). 
In a rapidly evolving eight 
minute 
improvisation, 
Dias 
quoted 
the 
“Gigue” 
from 
Bach’s “Cello Suite No. 3” 
and the Beatle’s “Norwegian 
Wood.” While this disparate 
assortment of musical subjects 
may sound illogical, it came 
across as the total opposite. It 
was just the natural next step 
in the ever-evolving, stream-
of-conscious 
performance 
style that the trio had adopted 
for the evening.
At one point in between 
two 
numbers, 
Mehmari 
described the connection he 
sees between Brazilian and 
American 
music. 
We 
live 
quite close to each other, he 
said, and yet “we don’t talk 
that much.” Drawing on this 
pan-American worldview, the 
concert eventually seemed to 
settle into two specific genres: 
Brazilian jazz and mid-20th-
century American jazz trio 
music.
Throughout 
the 
night, 
Mehmari would throw brief 
segments of stride piano into 
his improvisational repertoire. 
(Stride piano is the ragtime-
esque 
piano 
technique 
common in early 20th-century 
America.) For perhaps five 
or ten seconds, he would 
perform complex stride lines 
before reverting to a more 
neutral 21st-century piano trio 
texture.
At another point, the trio 
performed 
a 
traditional-
sounding ballad. Yet during the 

solo section, the piece quickly 
departed from the realm of the 
ballad into a much more lively 
realm, before returning back 
to a simple ballad texture. My 
expectations were constantly 
challenged 
throughout 
the 
night 
as 
the 
trio 
moved 
between stylistic realms.
To this end, Reze’s frequent 
changes 
between 
sticks, 
brushes 
and 
mallets 
was 
refreshing. 
Despite 
having 
a small drum kit in front of 
him, Reze managed to evoke 
many 
different 
textures. 
I 
also became fond of his active, 
expressive style of playing, as 
he moved his entire body to 
match each drum stroke. In 
one dramatic display, he moved 
one hand in large circles over 
his snare drum, not making 
a sound yet still contributing 
to the expressive effect of the 
piece.
Dias’s bass playing was also 
engaging, though perhaps in 
the polar opposite manner: 
Despite barely changing his 
style of playing, he managed 
to 
communicate 
the 
many 
different styles that the trio 
would cover throughout the 
night. If anything, I found 
myself 
wishing 
that 
Dias 
would branch out a bit in his 
playing. A walking bassline 
might have been nice at a few 
points, or perhaps longer and 
more varied solos. But as a 
background texture, Dias fit 
well into the trio.
Overall, the concert was an 
impressive amalgamation of 
different styles and genres. 
It was a captivating two-
hour improvisatory journey. 
Though slightly disorienting in 
the beginning, I found that by 
the end I had learned to enjoy 
the rapid switches. The music 
was evolving rapidly, beyond 
my control, and I was merely 
along for the ride.

In 
Dec. 
2017, 
Kristen 
Roupenian’s short story “Cat 
Person” was published in the New 
Yorker. Three days later, the story 
was viral.
“Cat Person” polarized the 
internet. The story was heralded 
by many women and condemned 
by many men — just read the 
account on twitter named “Men 
React to ‘Cat Person’,” with 
over 6,000 followers. The story 
explores the underlying gender 
dynamics in modern relationships 
through Margot, a college-aged 
woman, and Robert, an older 
man. Roupenian’s skin-crawling 
description of Margot’s headspace 
during 
a 
sexual 
encounter 
introduces 
an 
uncomfortable 
discussion 
around 
a 

woman’s 
seemingly 
“trivial” 
experience, an experience that 
happens to more women than not, 
but often goes unacknowledged.
Roupenian trusts her readers 
completely, allowing room to fill 
in the blanks regarding characters 
and setting. Perhaps this trust 
is what created a legacy for “Cat 
Person.” Roupenian’s characters 
could be me, they could be you, 
they could be anyone.
This 
trust 
carries 
into 
Roupenian’s collection of short 
stories, “You Know You Want 
This,” released on Jan. 15. Her 
preoccupation with sex, gender 
and 
power 
dynamics 
persist 
through 
the 
collection. 
She 
captures the use and misuse 
of empathy, the thrusting of 
desires on women and women’s 
reclaiming of these desires as their 
own. There is room for her stories 
to resonate with any reader who 
reaps the consequences of gender, 
making the collection especially 
profound 
in 
today’s 
political 
moment.
Roupenian 
read 
from 
her 
collection at Literati last Monday. 
Every seat was filled and the 
standing room claustrophobic — 
some people stood behind her on 
the steps to listen. “I live here,” 
she laughed as she adjusted the 
microphone, “this bookstore is 
one of my favorite places in the 
world.”
Roupenian read “Look at Your 
Game Girl,” a story that she does 
not publicly read often. It’s one of 
her most personal stories, one that 
is a little more autobiographical 
than her others. Listening to the 
story was anxiety-inducing in 
the way it was supposed to be. 

The story is intense in the most 
subliminal way, encapsulating a 
girl’s coming-of-age. She interacts 
with an older, invasive man, who 
holds something like admiration 
for Charles Mason and the Family. 
The man walks a fine line between 
innocence and cause for concern 
for the girl. We feel her resulting 
confusion, her inability to trust 
herself, her perpetual reasoning 
and overthinking. Most of all, we 
feel her realization that the world 
is a scary place.
This realization resonates with 
most women, especially in the 
context of what Roupenian names 
the “vague male threat.” In “Look 
at Your Game Girl,” Roupenian 
pinpoints the adolescent detection 
of seeing danger where there is 
none and not seeing danger when 
there is some. She weaves the overt 
observance and overthinking of 
young girls into the same fabric 
as their vulnerability. As a result, 
the confusion of her character is 
visceral.
Through hearing Roupenian 
read, I was pulled back into my 
adolescence. I was forced to face 
the inexplicable paranoia and 
fear that plagued me during my 
coming-of-age. I was forced to 
contemplate when those emotions 
were misplaced and when they 
should’ve been placed, but were 
not. Did the old man at the gas 
station smile at me because he was 
friendly? Is this car going to follow 
me home?
As she read, many nodded in 
understanding. I was not alone. 
The 
experiences 
Roupenian 
encapsulates 
are 
things 
unacknowledged but familiar, and 
she confronts them head on.

I let out a soft, audible gasp 
during The Story. I’m referring, 
of course, not to the 2007 hit 
off of Brandi Carlile’s album of 
the same name, but to “Vlad the 
Astrophysicist,” the picture book 
that Peter Mulvey read aloud to the 
audience during an intermission 
toward the end of the night.
It felt fitting to be read a story 
in the midst of a night like this, 
the first night of the 42nd Ann 
Arbor Festival. Folk music is 
all about stories — especially in 
the existential vein of “Vlad the 
Astrophysicist,” a story about 
examining the place of humanity 
as a blip against the infinite 
canvases of space and time. This 
was the only picture book read 
during the night, but Mulvey, 
as the MC, bookended every set 
with performances of his own 
music. It was clear that it was 
going to be a good night from the 
beginning, with his earnest humor 
and understated performance of 
songs like “D.I.A.,” a song about 
a morning spent leaving Gregory 
Alan Isakov’s house in Colorado 
that eclipses into Johnny Cash’s 
“Wayfaring Stranger” at the end.
The first act Mulvey introduced 
was The Michigan Rattlers, a folk-
rock band from Petoskey. The 
Michigan 
Rattlers 
kickstarted 
the night with an enthusiastic set 
bolstered by the good-hearted 
chemistry that no doubt comes 
from being childhood friends. 
Advocating for Michigan’s country 
undercurrents, the band made 
sure that the folk fest began on a 
high note, delivering energy and a 
shared feeling of fun.
Haley Heynderickx took over 

next, 
an 
incredible 
standout. 
Mulvey 
introduced 
her 
as 
an 
empathetic 
storyteller, 
an 
assessment 
that 
her 
modest, 
charming stage presence only 
confirmed. 
She 
spoke 
softly 
and sang with a striking and 
room-resounding power. Every 
song reaffirmed one of the most 
important notions of the night, 
one that would echo again and 
again over the next few hours: The 
idea that folk is an ever-changing 
organism, buoyed along its way as 
much by tongue-in-cheek humor 
and emotional disaster as it is by 
love and togetherness. The best 
part of Heyndrickx’s performance 
was the entire audience at Hill 
Auditorium singing gently along 
to “Oom Sha La La” (although 
her introduction of “The Bug 
Collector,” when she remarked 
upon its subject matter that 
“everything else has been written,” 
is a close second).
Sam Lewis was next, a singer-
songwriter from Nashville. Lewis’s 
music was striking for its earnest, 
country-informed sensibility and 
particularly his affected delivery of 
songs like “Accidental Harmony.” 
Even for a night filled with good 
cheer, Lewis’s sense of humor 
stood out, idiosyncratic and wholly 
unintimidated. Then Parsonsfield 
took 
the 
stage, 
bringing 
an 
inimitable energy that felt most 
actualized on songs like “Weeds 
or Wildflowers,” “Kick Out the 
Windows,” and “Let the Mermaids 
Flirt With Me.” Parsonsfield felt 
like everything one could want 
from a single band: Each of the 
four members was wired, engaged, 
and from the looks of it, having the 
time of their life. The set spanned 
a lot of genres, from old-styled folk 
to Americana to bluegrass, and the 

band had the instrumental and 
musical versatility to step up to 
each of these ambitions.
After 
a 
brief 
intermission, 
Gregory Alan Isakov took over — 
initially by himself, but quickly 
joined by a supporting band. 
Isakov’s 
set 
exemplified 
the 
quieter capabilities of folk music; 
he lulled us collectively further 
into the night, together in the 
warm concert hall while snow 
drifted down outside, unknown by 
us except as a kind of felt beauty. 
The singer-songwriter played a lot 
of tunes off of his new record from 
last year, Evening Machines, like 
the contemplative “Chemicals” 
and “San Luis.” He and his band 
were illuminated by lights that 
periodically washed them in a swell 
of red, as well as two small globes 
of the planet Earth that glowed on 
tabletops, casting everything even 
more with a feeling of suspension 
between the past and the future, 
the evening and the morning.
Finally, it was time for the 
headliner of the night: Brandi 
Carlile. During his introduction, 
Mulvey reminded us of Carlile’s 
beginnings over a decade ago as 
a busker, and how even today, she 
still pours her heart and soul into 
every performance. Carlile set 
about proving this from the very 
first song she played — “Follow,” 
off her self-titled debut. She told 
the audience after this that she 
often played “Follow” to “break 
the ice, because I get nervous,” but 
instantly afterward, she grinned, 
as if suddenly installed with 
confidence, and added, “Okay, here 
we go.” And there we went.

MATTHEWS SHUTS DOWN ROMEO LANGFORD. AGAIN.

BLOOMINGTON — John 

Beilein didn’t want his team 
switching.

For a team with an 

elite defense — one often 
predicated on doing just 
that — it seemed like a bold 
strategy. But, as is often the 
case, the Michigan men’s 
basketball coach knew what 
he was doing.

Beilein wanted redshirt 

junior wing Charles 
Matthews on Indiana’s 
Romeo Langford in every 
way possible. On Jan. 6 
in Ann Arbor, Matthews 
locked down Langford, and 
against a Hoosiers team 
lacking in depth, it was 

imperative that Langford 
was once again kept in 
check. Matthews, a guy 
who takes every matchup 
personally, had no qualms 
with the plan.

“We wanted Charles on 

(Langford),” Beilein said. 
“Charles? He likes that.”

If the game in Ann Arbor 

was part one of Matthews 
vs. Langford, Friday was 
part two — and Matthews 
won this round even more 
handily than the first.

A shot clock issue caused 

the PA announcer to 
verbally count down the 
time remaining on every 
Hoosier offensive possession 
in the first half. For the first 
seven minutes, the action 
at that end was a surreal 
sequence of numbers and 

bricked shots and boos — so 
many boos — as Michigan 
jumped out to a 17-0 lead.

And there in the middle 

of all of it was 
Matthews, 
who had four 
rebounds 
before Indiana 
had a single 
point and 
generated 
chances for 
his team 
even through 
periods 
of sloppy 
offensive play.

Langford, 

meanwhile, 
had three fouls in the first 
nine minutes of the game 
and sat the rest of the half.

“(Matthews is) just a 

fierce competitor and he 
knows his angles really 
well,” said freshman 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis. 

“He’s also got 
that reach and 
athleticism 
but it’s also 
the way he 
defends, you 
know, he cuts 
off what you 
like to do best 
and he’s quick 
to knowing 
what the player 
does best.”

Back on 

the court in 
the second 

half, Langford started a 
mini-Indiana run with a 
layup and the Hoosiers cut 
the Wolverines’ lead to as 

little as nine at one point. 
With Langford on the floor, 
Indiana’s offense seemed to 
have the kind of flow it was 
previously missing.

Then, Matthews was 

accidentally kicked in the 
head and lay, reeling, down 
on all fours before leaving 
the court briefly as both 
teams went to timeout.

Instead of leaving injured, 

Matthews got back up and 
taunted the Hoosiers even 
more. He sunk both free 
throws, then hit a three and 
then a jump shot just within 
the arc. By then, Michigan 
was up 16 and the game was 
back out of reach for the 
Hoosiers.

“Anytime we see Charles 

doing that, it kinda rubs 
off on myself,” said junior 

guard Zavier Simpson. 
“Rubs off on Iggy, rubs off 
on the rest of the players on 
the court, we see that, we 
feel, then just keep it going.”

During their first 

matchup, Langford still 
managed to get a little. He 
still finished with 17 points 
— low by his standards, 
maybe, but not by anyone 
else’s — and found a groove 
in the second half. On 
Friday, he scored just nine 
on 3-for-12 shooting. Thanks 
primarily to Matthews, one 
of the top freshmen in the 
country looked like just 
another pedestrian.

Langford may have been 

on his home court, but 
Matthews looked like the 
one who had been there 
before.

“Well, I obviously want to kill 
them every time. I want to win 
every single match, as a team. 
I want to blow them out and 
sweep them.”
I was once told you should 
never start a 
story with a 
quote, but I’m 
pretty sure I 
can’t convey 
the Michigan 
wrestling 
team’s 
feelings 
for 
Ohio 
State 
better 
than 
those 
words 
from 
Mason 
Parris.
Maybe those feelings came 
from the No. 6 Wolverines’ 
ranking, four spots behind the 
Buckeyes despite having one 
extra win on their record, or 
maybe they’re from a deep-set 
rivalry. Either way, Michigan 
rode that mentality to its ninth 
win of the season with a 19-17 
decision over Ohio State — one 
where the Wolverines collected 
the winning points of an upset in 
the last match of the night.
Parris won a 6-3 decision in 
the final bout to overcome the 
Buckeyes’ one-point lead, sealing 
the victory for Michigan. Back in 
November, the freshman had his 
redshirt pulled prior to a meet 
against Oregon State. That put 
him up against the No. 1-ranked 
heavyweight, Amar Dhesi, in his 
first meet competing attached to 
Michigan. 
Parris won that match, 11-4. 
That victory capped off a 
33-8 win over the Beavers, 
which pretty much represents 
the majority of Michigan’s 8-0 
record prior to Friday’s meeting 
with the Buckeyes. In half of 
those meets, the Wolverines 
scored at least 30 points, with 
their smallest margin of victory 
being a 21-13 win over Lehigh in 
November.
With a new head coach and 
a lot of big names on its roster, 

Michigan’s first eight wins did 
a lot to showcase its potential. 
But Friday against Ohio State, 
it proved just how far that 
potential 
could 
go. 
The Buckeyes 
are 
ranked 
second 
in 
the 
nation, 
only 
behind reigning 
national 
champion 
Penn 
State. 
They 
have a trio of 
undefeated 
seniors in Joey 
McKenna, Myles Martin and 
Kollin Moore, who are now 
a combined 36-0 and helped 
Ohio State to a Big Ten title last 
season. They’ve also got six top-
10 wrestlers in different weight 

classes, while the Wolverines 
have five including Parris, who 
entered the weekend at seventh 
among heavyweights. 
So, 
needless 
to say, Friday’s 
matchup wasn’t 
exactly 
easy. 
Sophomore Drew 
Mattin 
kicked 
off 
the 
meet 
with 
a 
three-
point 
decision, 
thanks to a 12-6 
win over Malik 
Heinselman. 
Right after that 
came arguably the best match 
of the night when top-ranked 
redshirt junior Stevan Micic 
notched a 14-1 major over No. 6 
Luke Pletcher for his ninth win 
of the season. 

“I think when you just look at 
matchups, obviously probably 
two of the higher-ranked guys 
wrestling each other were Stevan 
Micic and Luke Pletcher,” said 
Michigan coach Sean Bormet. 
“And Stevan just came out with 
his offense flying and he really 
just dismantled the kid.”
But Ohio State was ranked 
second for a reason and by the 
time the last bout rolled around, 
the Buckeyes led by a single 
point, 
leaving 
the 
deciding 
match to the heavyweights — 
Parris 
and 
freshman 
Chase 
Singletary. 
Back in November, Singletary 
issued Parris one of his three 
losses 
of 
the 
season 
with 
a 15-9 decision at the Ohio 
Intercollegiate Open. This time 
around, Parris was quick to 

take advantage — he scored the 
first takedown, then the second, 
and with a reversal in the third 
period, he put the score at 
6-3, proving the Wolverines’ 
capabilities with a 19-17 upset. 
“We knew it was going to be 
a hard-fought dual from top to 
bottom,” Bormet said. “We knew 
it was going to come down to 
bonus points in some of those 
weights, us getting bonus points 
and trying to prevent them from 
getting bonus points. 
“We thought if that played 
out, that it would come down to 
heavyweight, and we’ve got a lot 
of confidence in Mason Parris. 
He’s a great competitor and he 
did an awesome job sealing the 
victory for us.”
For a program that was 
ranked sixth nationally with an 

8-0 record, the win over Ohio 
State was big. It proved that the 
names on Michigan’s roster are 
big, and they’ve got potential to 
make the program a contender 
for a Big Ten title. But that win 
over the No. 2 program prefaces 
an even bigger, flashier obstacle 
just five days away — No. 1 Penn 
State. 
The Nittany Lions will have 
had a tight hold on the top spot 
when they host the Wolverines 
on Friday, highlighted by a 
54-dual win streak, 32 of which 
are within conference confines. 
That streak dates back all the 
way back until Feb. 15, 2015.
That being said, Michigan has 
already proved its itself to be a 
national contender. Now it’s time 
to see if it can defy expectations 
as well. 

At Ohio State, Parris sets the stage

Wolverines ride team effort, 
Parris’ confidence to 19-17 win

With the dual meet and an 
undefeated record on the line, 
freshman heavyweight Mason 
Parris was the perfect wrestler 
to have on the mat for the 
Wolverines. In front of a packed 
Value City Arena and despite 
a slim deficit, Michigan coach 
Sean Bormet, and Parris himself, 
anticipated a favorable finish to 
the meet.
“The team score more than 
anything leading up to my match 
excited me more,” Parris said. “I 
was happy it came down to me. I 
just had a lot of faith in myself and 
confidence.”
The No. 6 Michigan Wrestling 
team (9-0 overall, 5-0 Big Ten) 
trailed No. 2 Ohio 
State (7-1 overall, 
3-1 Big Ten) by 
only one point 
entering the final 
match of the dual 
meet between the 
then-undefeated 
rivals. 
The 
moment 
also 
offered 
Parris 
a 
chance 
at 
redemption 
wrestling 
against 
Chase 
Singletary, who he had lost to 
earlier this season.
“Then this week I really 
hammered down the stuff I knew 
he was gonna do to me,” Parris 
said. “I knew he was gonna hit low 
singles on me, I figured he was 
gonna try to throw legs on me. I’m 
glad that I wrestled him before 
because I was really prepared for 
the match.”
Parris’ efforts were rewarded 
with the deciding victory in the 
meet, earning the Wolverines 
three team points and a 19-17 win.
The 
energy 
of 
a 
nearly-
full audience of Buckeye fans 
impacted the meet early and often. 
In the third match of the day, 
fifth-ranked redshirt sophomore 
Kanen Storr faced second-ranked 
Joey McKenna. Down 6-0 after 
the first period of the match, 
Bormet instructed Storr from the 

corner to start the second period 
in the top position, but the 141-
pound Storr began the period 
beneath his opponent. It seemed 
as if the crowd noise and chaotic 
arena atmosphere — which the 
team had prepared for by blasting 
crowd noise during practice this 
week — was wearing on Michigan.
“Basically what happened was 
when he first looked over to our 
corner, the official was in the way 
… and then as soon as he could 
see us he wanted to switch to 
bottom and the official wouldn’t 
let him which is a little unusual,” 
Bormet said. “Usually if the guy 
changes his mind quickly based 
on the corner, usually they allow 
the guy to change to the position 
they want. But it was the crowd, 
but also the officials blocking his 
view.”
Storr 
would 
go on to lose 
by 
technical 
fall. It was the 
Wolverines’ first 
loss of the day, 
after sophomore 
Drew 
Mattin 
and 
redshirt 
junior 
Stevan 
Micic had won by 
regular decision 
and major decision, respectively, 
to build a 7-0 lead. The match 
following Storr’s was another win 
for Ohio State, this time a major 
decision for third-ranked Micah 
Jordan over fifth-year senior 
Malik Amine.
The Buckeyes took the lead 
with Jordan’s victory, and just 
as soon as the momentum had 
shifted in favor of Ohio State, 
Michigan stole it right back. The 
Wolverines won the next three 
matches on the shoulders of their 
experience, 
namely 
fifth-year 
senior Alec Pantaleo, redshirt 
junior Logan Massa and redshirt 
junior Myles Amine.
Heading into the heavyweight 
matchup, Michigan had seen 
its 16-9 lead evaporate as the 
Wolverines’ redshirt freshman JT 
Correll lost to the Buckeyes’ top-
ranked Myles Martin in the 184-
pound class and redshirt junior 

Jackson Striggow was defeated by 
Ohio State’s second-ranked Kollin 
Moore in the 197-pound class. 
The two losses put Michigan 
behind by one, where the score 
would remain until Parris rode 
his confidence and preparation to 
victory.
“We thought if that played 
out, that it would come down to 
heavyweight,” Bormet said. “And 
we’ve got a lot of confidence in 
Mason Parris.”
The scoreless tie appeared to 
have been broken at the end of 
the first period when Parris took 
down the Buckeyes’ Singletary, 
but it was ruled to have been out 
of bounds. Bormet threw the 
challenge brick, but the ensuing 
challenge confirmed the call on 
the mat.
“Well, I for sure thought that I 
had the takedown,” Parris said. “I 
had his leg hooked and was behind 
both of his arms, which should 
have been a takedown. But I knew 
if they didn’t call it, it wasn’t gonna 
be a big deal and I had to keep my 
composure and my head in the 
match. I just had to think about 
taking him down again.”
Regardless, it wouldn’t take 
long for the coach’s confidence 
to pay off. Parris took down his 
opponent two more times to 
secure a 6-3 victory by decision 
and win the meet for the 
Wolverines.
Friday night’s victory is the 
most recent in an impressive 
season for Michigan, one that 
has the possibility of becoming 
a lot more impressive in the near 
future. The Wolverines head 
to State College for a dual meet 
against top-ranked Penn State 
next weekend. After beating the 
Buckeyes this past weekend, 
Michigan could be on top of the 
college wrestling world — and the 
NCAA rankings — in less than a 
week.
“We’ll just continue to focus 
day-to-day 
and 
enjoying 
our 
training and enjoying each other 
and our team,” Bormet said. “And 
look forward to the challenge and 
the opportunity against Penn 
State a week from tonight.”

‘M’ falls to MSU despite late rally

As Nicole Munger drove 
inside on a fastbreak midway 
through the first quarter in a 
77-73 loss to Michigan State, 
she screamed in pain and fell 
to the ground after barreling 
into a Spartan defender. As 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico came out to check on 
her, Munger was helped off the 
court by two assistant coaches, 
leaving the Michigan women’s 
basketball team without one 
of its captains as it prepared to 
try to win a contest against its 
in-state rivals.
The loss of Munger did 
nothing to help the Wolverines. 
The Spartans (15-5 overall, 
5-4 Big Ten) responded with 
a 13-2 run to close the quarter 
and take a lead that they would 
never relinquish as Michigan 
(12-9, 3-6) fell in a crushing 
77-73 defeat that saw them fail 
to complete a comeback despite 
a valiant late effort.
“Once Nicole went down we 
weren’t able to respond right 
away,” Barnes Arico said. “And 
they went on a little bit of a 
run and took us some time to 
regroup.”
“She’s gonna get checked 
out,” said sophomore forward 
Hailey Brown. “We don’t really 

know much about that.”
The 
Wolverines 
managed 
to keep the game fairly close 
for most of the second quarter, 
but Michigan State’s defense 
put the clamps on late. It held 
Michigan scoreless over the 
period’s final 3:24 and went on 
a 7-0 run to head to the locker 
room with a 41-31 edge.
On the offensive end, the 
Spartans hit eight 3-pointers 
in the first half, including a 
stretch in the first quarter that 
saw them hit three consecutive 
triples after Munger left the 
game. 
They 
would 
finish 
with 11 makes from deep. 
Losing Munger also affected 
Michigan’s offensive gameplan, 
as the team attempted just ten 
3-pointers.
As the second half began, 
it was more of the same for 
both teams, with the Spartans 
starting the quarter on a 5-0 
run and Michigan committing 
two 
turnovers. 
While 
the 
Wolverines would appear to be 
on the verge of finally making 
an offensive run at times, 
Michigan 
State 
was 
ready 
with an answer at every turn, 
eventually extending its lead to 
15 points.
Michigan, 
though, 
would 
eventually make its push late 
in the period. The Wolverines 
finished the period on an 8-0 

scoring run to cut the lead to 
five heading into the fourth 
quarter, sending the Crisler 
Center crowd into a frenzy.
“It goes to show that our 
team, we don’t back down to 
anyone,” Brown said. “Until 
we hear the final whistle, until 
the game is done, we’ll stop 
playing, but until then we’re 
gonna keep going and trying to 
get a W.”
The Wolverines made one 
last push towards the end of the 
final quarter, with freshman 
forward Naz Hillmon’s layup 
cutting 
the 
lead 
to 
67-63 
with two minutes to go, but 
ultimately untimely turnovers 
by Michigan and free throws 
from Michigan State sealed the 
Wolverines’ fate.
One 
key 
sequence 
came 
when Michigan trailed by four 
with about a minute and a 
half to go in the game. Senior 
forward Hallie Thome had a 
pass go off of her hands. On the 
court, the referee signaled it 
was Michigan possession, but 
after further review, the ball 
was awarded to the Spartans, 
who promptly gave it away 
after 
a 
traveling 
violation. 
The Wolverines seemed to 
have some hope for a moment, 
but Michigan turned it over 
after the inbounds pass was 
intercepted.

NEW YORK CITY — If 
you count striking iron, Nick 
Pastujov had a hat trick in 
the first period alone, and 
Michigan led Penn State, 4-3.
Officials don’t though, and 
nothing in the rulebook would 
have aided the Wolverines’ 
offensive 
execution 
on 
Saturday night.
When 
Nittany 
Lions’ 
goaltender 
Peyton 
Jones 
blocked junior forward Will 
Lockwood’s shot eight minutes 
into the game, Pastujov shifted 
to Jones’ weakside, the puck 
careening 
towards 
right 
towards him. With nothing 
between his stick and the back 
of the net beside the puck itself, 
he reared his stick and flicked 
the puck forward.
It hit the crossbar.
Michigan got the puck back 
seven times after his miss 
before Jones gloved it. The 
result? Seven missed shots. All 

from point-blank range.
Six minutes later? Pastujov 
took another shot. Again, 
a 
familiar 
clank 
echoed 
throughout 
Madison Square 
Garden.
Pastujov 
found the bar 
once 
more, 
and in a period 
where it outshot 
Penn State 22-8, 
Michigan 
had 
nothing to show 
but a three-goal 
deficit.
“That’s just the way it goes 
sometimes,” said sophomore 
forward Luke Morgan. “We 
came out ready to play, we hit 
a bunch of post. We had a lot 
of great opportunities. I think 
we got a little frustrated with 
that. When that happens, it 
led to mental mistakes and 
some of it we can work on, but 
sometimes it’s just the way the 
game goes.”
Against 
Minnesota 
and 

Michigan State earlier this 
season, the Wolverines took 
45-plus shots but failed to 
capitalize on many of their 
easier attempts. 
The difference 
against 
the 
Nittany 
Lions, 
though, 
was 
that 
Michigan 
consistently 
got 
good 
opportunities 
in 
the 
crease 
and 
actively 
screened 
off 
Jones 
instead 
of blindly shooting into the 
opposing team’s blue line.
“It’s 
frustrating, 
but 
that’s going to happen,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“ … And that’s the game and 
what you have to do is you can’t 
get away from your game.”
By the time Penn State 
jumped out to a three-goal 
lead, it was too late, though. 
All 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offensive 
pressure 
and 
momentum was rendered moot 
by their inability to finish, and 
completely eviscerated each 
time the blue line coughed the 
puck up deep in the defensive 
zone and yielded to a Nittany 
Lion odd-man rushes. 
Contrary to what the 5-2 
score suggests, Michigan, just 
like before, had every chance 
to walk out of Madison Square 
Garden with at least another 
point. Instead, it walks out 
of Madison Square Garden 
lamenting a game it had in 
control. It’s easy to focus on 
the back-breaking defensive 
turnovers, but in a zero-sum 
game, offensive miscues hurt 
the Wolverines just as much.
“Coach 
said 
‘we 
can’t 
outscore 
our 
mistakes,’” 
Morgan said. “We have to play 
a solid 60 (minutes) the whole 
way through.”

Different city, different defense

NEW YORK CITY — The 
script flipped quickly for the 
Michigan hockey team: Five 
goals scored Thursday. Five 
goals allowed Saturday.
Any 
momentum 
the 
Wolverines 
generated 
from 
Thursday 
night’s 
five-goal 
outburst against Penn State 
was abruptly halted when they 
gave up five goals themselves on 
Saturday.
In Thursday night’s 5-1 victory 
over Penn State, the Wolverines 
were dialed in from the opening 
faceoff to the final buzzer. There 
were few lapses on the defensive 
end 
and 
few 
opportunities 
came easily for Penn State. The 
Nittany Lions had few, if any, 
odd-man rushes throughout the 
game.
The lone goal came more 
than mid-way through the third 
period 
when 
the 
Michigan 
was leading 4-0. A pass from 
behind the net deflected off 
senior defenseman Nick Boka’s 
skate and trickled past junior 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne.
Moreover, 
the 
Wolverine 
defense jumpstarted the offense 
after its lackluster first period. 
The first goal for Michigan was 

set up after freshman forward 
Jimmy 
Lambert 
collected 
possession in the defensive zone 
and flipped a pass to sophomore 
forward Dakota Raabe in the 
neutral zone. It resulted in a 
breakaway goal for Raabe to give 
the Wolverines the lead.
Saturday’s 5-2 loss at Madison 
Square Garden was in complete 
contrast to the near perfect 
defensive performance put forth 
on Thursday by the Wolverines.
It was a tale of defensive 
gaffes.
“We didn’t play on the right 
side of the puck,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. “We did not 
sense danger — and I don’t want 
to say our whole team, but a few 
individuals. We just didn’t sense 
that urgency or the danger and 
they made us pay.”
Four of Penn State’s five goals 
were a direct result of a defensive 
lapse.
Just over five minutes into 
the game, a mishandled pass 
by Lambert near the defensive 
zone blue line lead to a wide-
open shot attempt forward Evan 
Barratt. He capitalized on the 
opportunity to open up scoring, 
putting the Nittany Lions up, 1-0.
Minutes later, a turnover from 
sophomore defenseman Quinn 
Hughes near center-ice resulted 

in a breakaway goal, handing 
Penn State a 2-0 lead.
And just before the first 
intermission, senior defenseman 
Joseph Cecconi lost his footing 
as he was turning to skate up 
the ice, allowing for another 
breakaway. This time, forward 
Alec 
Marsh 
finished 
past 
Lavigne to make it 3-0.
Midway through the second 
period, the Wolverines had a 
chance to climb back into the 
game with a score of 4-1, and 
Michigan on the power play. As 
Hughes was advancing the puck 
up towards center ice, he looked 
to dump a pass back to a trailing 
junior forward Will Lockwood. 
The pass was intercepted, and 
the Nittany Lions, once again, 
successfully capitalized on a 
breakaway opportunity, 5-1.
The play was a microcosm of 
the game. A Michigan misstep 
led to a Penn State goal. This 
one was a backbreaker against 
the Wolverines from which they 
were unable to recover.
“It’s a game of mistakes and 
you have to limit your mistake 
and try to make less than the 
other team,” Pearson said. “And 
you have to try to take advantage 
of the mistakes. We did that 
on Thursday night, they got us 
tonight.”

Hughes’ faults on display in loss

NEW YORK CITY — Quinn 
Hughes went into the locker 
room 
and 
turned 
to 
the 
team. After a poor showing 
defensively, Hughes did what he 
had to do. He was accountable 
for his sloppiness in Saturday’s 
game against No. 15 Penn 
State, one that the Michigan 
hockey team lost, 5-2, with the 
sophomore defenseman at the 
epicenter.
“I just thought he had a 
tough night as far as a couple of 
his turnovers,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. “And he 
knows. He stood up in the locker 
room and took responsibility 
for them.”
It’s easy to point the blame. 
Anyone can do it. But when two 
goals are scored directly after a 
player’s turnovers, it becomes 
even easier to point the finger a 
certain way.
“As long as you play this game 
and you’re a hockey player,” 
Pearson said. “You’re going to 
have some nights that are hard 
and it’s one of those nights for 
him.”
It began with a normal 
play — Hughes with the puck 
bringing it up the ice to start 
the offensive push. As a skilled 
skater and, as Pearson notes, an 
elite player, it’s a norm for him 
to push the puck through the 
neutral zone.
However, midway through 
the 
first 
period, 
he 
was 
contested on his offensive zone 
entry attempt.
Stick 
extended. 
Sticks 
clashed. Puck out.
Hughes 
had 
seen 
the 
opposing player speed toward 
him and held his stick out wide 
to try and protect the puck 
from the contest. Despite his 
attempt to protect the puck, the 
two sticks clashed against one 
another and resulted with the 
puck leaking toward Michigan’s 
net.
Nittany Lion Liam Folkes 
took the one-on-none chance 
and increased Penn State’s lead 
to two.
The 
main 
problem 
with 

Hughes’ turnover was that 
no one was back to defend the 
breakaway. Senior defenseman 
Joseph Cecconi had pushed 
far up to take a more offensive 
stance, yet when the puck was 
loose, he lagged behind the play.
“We 
had 
a 
defenseman 
back,” Pearson said. “He’s the 
last man, we’re trying to beat a 
guy in the neutral zone and his 
partner is not backing him up, 
he’s ahead of him. So, he gets 
stripped, there’s no support. 
Breakaway.”
Of course, Cecconi shouldn’t 
have been as far up as he 
was, but Hughes should have 
recognized that and the risks of 
a turnover in that situation. The 
only thing separating Lavigne 
from Folkes was Hughes, and 
he failed to recognize it.
His second lapse was the nail 
in the coffin.
Down three and on the power 
play in the middle of the second 
period, the Wolverines needed 
to convert the man-advantage 
in the worst way. A goal would 
have 
brought 
them 
within 
striking distance. Instead, a 
Hughes’ turnover resulted in 
insurmountable deficit.
Hughes, again, brought the 
puck up to the neutral zone. He 

made a pass back to a trailing 
teammate. However, no one 
was in the vicinity that could 
get to the puck in time. Instead, 
Nittany Lion Alex Limoges stole 
the puck from the intended pass 
and hammered it home after 
beating Lavigne on the one-on-
none.
“Obviously in the start of the 
second, a power play, we made 
a drop pass to one of our guys 
and we don’t have support,” 
Pearson said. “We’re all by the 
puck. We didn’t play on the 
right side of the puck. We did 
not sense danger — and I don’t 
want to say our whole team, 
but a few individuals. We just 
didn’t sense that urgency or the 
danger and they made us pay.”
Again, 
the 
presumption 
that there was a player behind 
haunted the Wolverines and 
allowed a direct confrontation 
with 
Lavigne. 
Hughes 
was 
unable to recognize it, and his 
turnovers caused goals. He did, 
however, recognize his faults.
“I think once you speak 
out, and take responsibility, 
then you gotta step up and you 
gotta do it on the ice,” Pearson 
said. “And it’s hard. You know. 
It’s hard to admit your faults 
sometimes.”

NEW YORK CITY — For 
the second time in two periods, 
sophomore defenseman Quinn 
Hughes turned the puck over near 
center ice.
And for the second time in two 
periods, No. 15 Penn State (14-10-
2 overall, 6-9-1-1 Big Ten) took its 
chance and ran with it.
This time, the turnover came 
when the Wolverines were on the 
man advantage and hoping to cut 
into the Nittany Lions’ 4-1 lead 
early in the second period. Hughes 
lost control of the puck in the 
middle of the ice, which allowed 
forward Alex Limoges to grab it 
and skate in right in front of junior 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne.
Lavigne sprawled out to make 
the save as Limoges wound his way 
to the front of the crease, waiting 
to shoot the puck until Lavigne 
was flat on the ice. One quick flip 
of his stick later and Penn State led, 
5-1.
Though Michigan (9-10-6, 5-6-
4-2) tacked on another goal in the 
third period, the comeback came 
up short. The Nittany Lions went 
on to take the second game of the 
series, 5-2.
“We did not get the result we 
wanted,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “Very frustrating 
in the locker room because we 
know we’re a better team. We 
beat ourselves tonight, plain and 
simple.”
Penn State averages an NCAA-
leading 4.52 goals per game, and 
the Wolverines allowed them all of 
that and then some Saturday night 
at Madison Square Garden.
Early 
in 
the 
first 
period, 
freshman forward Jimmy Lambert 
lost 
the 
puck 
at 
Michigan’s 
defensive blueline. Forward Evan 
Barratt, who ranks second in the 
country with an average of 1.45 
points per game, took advantage 
of his opportunity and fired a shot 

that beat Lavigne to the upper 
corner of the net.
Five minutes later, Hughes’ 
turnover at center ice led to a one-
on-zero breakaway for Penn State 
and Liam Folkes converted.
“It was nice,” said Penn State 
coach Guy Gadowsky. “(Scoring on 
breakaways) hasn’t been the case 
in the past, either. It was nice to get 
it early. Any time you can capitalize 
on anything, I think it’s important, 
but we were able to capitalize on a 
couple of their mistakes as well.”
Just before the horn sounded to 
end the first period, junior forward 
Nick Pastujov had an opportunity 
on the power play — but his shot 
rang the post, just as all three of his 
shots did in the game.
And as the puck went down 
toward Lavigne, Penn State was 
able to capitalize on a third one-on-
zero chance with a goal from Alec 
Marsh. With another 40 minutes 
left to play, Michigan faced a three-
goal deficit that looked — and was 
— insurmountable.
“We made some horrendous 
turnovers, they took advantage 
of it,” Pearson said. “That was the 
game. They got the lead 3-0 and 
we couldn’t outscore our mistakes 
tonight.”
Down 4-0 early in the second 
period, the Wolverines found 
twine on a shot from Hughes that 
redshirt junior forward Luke 
Morgan was able to send past 
goaltender Peyton Jones. But it 
proved to be too little, too late as 
the Nittany Lions extended their 
lead back to four goals just minutes 
later.
And once that goal went in to 
make it 5-1, Lavigne was pulled 
in favor of Strauss Mann. The 
freshman goaltender stopped all 19 
shots he faced the rest of the way.
“Excellent,” Pearson said of 
Mann’s performance. “You know, 
we really like him as a goaltender, 
and we think he has a bright future 
at Michigan. I didn’t want to have 
to get him in like we did but he 

went in and I give him credit, that’s 
a tough situation to go in and he 
played extremely well. He gave us 
an opportunity to try and get back 
into the game.”
But 
despite 
Mann’s 
play, 
defense — or lack thereof — was 
Michigan’s downfall, just as it was 
what allowed it to beat Penn State 
5-1 at home on Thursday.
“Disappointing 
outcome, 
especially after Thursday night’s 
game,” Pearson said. “I can’t tell 
you our team wasn’t prepared to 
play. I thought we had a pretty 
good first period, outshot them 
22-8, out-attempted them 37-16. 
Hit four posts. But we didn’t make 
a commitment to team defense.”
Michigan outshot the Nittany 
Lions for the majority of the game, 
though Penn State finished the 
game with a 39-37 shot advantage. 
Catching the post four times put 
the Wolverines within millimeters 
of making it a much closer game.
But as Pearson said, they 
couldn’t outscore their mistakes.
Coming within millimeters just 
wasn’t enough.

As Michigan delights, Assembly Hall’s student section dismays

BLOOMINGTON 
— 
Look 
up any list of the toughest 
road environments in college 
basketball 
and 
Indiana’s 
Assembly Hall will inevitably 
be slotted at the very top. 
Alternatively, you could just ask 
Michigan coach John Beilein.
Just six days ago, when the 
Wolverines fell at Wisconsin, 
Beilein made sure to remind 
reporters that, “People don’t 
lose here because it’s the Kohl 
Center,” instead praising the 
Badgers’ on-court product. But 
this, he explained, was different.
“They have a tremendous 
home 
court 
atmosphere 
in 
Bloomington,” Beilein said on 
Thursday. “… You’re on the road, 
in an environment, and you’re 
not comfortable. Then, all of 
a sudden, you look like a shell 
of who you can be. And it just 
happens.”
Beilein’s 
prediction 
could 
hardly have come further from 
fruition, as Michigan stormed 
out to a 17-0 lead, reducing the 
Hoosier faithful to a stunned 
silence.
“I love that,” said freshman 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis after 
the game. “One of my favorite 
parts of basketball is shutting the 
crowd down. I love going on the 
road.”
Anticipating that boisterous 
home 
crowd 
that 
Beilein 
referenced, I perched myself in 
the middle of Indiana’s student 
section, planning to write about 
the challenge the Wolverines 
would have to overcome.
Before the game even tipped 
off, I realized that angle might 
not hold up. As the students 
struggled to fill the upper reaches 
of their allotted section, I turned 
to Justin, the kid next to me, and 
expressed my surprise at the 
attendance.
“Yeah dude we suck,” Justin 
said, explaining that he didn’t 
think 
the 
Hoosiers 
had 
a 
chance of toppling fifth-ranked 
Michigan.
Within minutes, it became 
clear that he wasn’t alone.
When junior center Jon Teske 
followed 
Brazdeikis’ 
game-

opening three with a rejection 
at the rim on Indiana’s first 
possession, it drew a cacophony 
of frustration.
“Classic IU start, we’ll be down 
7-0 before we score,” predicted 
Caleb, an out-of-state sophomore 
who grew up a Duke fan.
Turns out his estimate sold the 
Wolverines 10 points short.
7-0 came and passed on a 
wing three from sophomore 
Jordan Poole, before Brazdeikis 
made it with 10 by driving past 
Hoosier guard Zach McRoberts, 
a common target of fan criticism.
“Fuck 
this 
motherfucker,” 
sounded a voice behind me, who 
spent the rest of the evening 
proclaiming 
that 
McRoberts 
“should not be on this team.”
After a turnover on Indiana’s 
next possession, that voice — 

belonging to Connor, a freshman 
from Chicago — offered up his 
only bit of optimism for the night, 
even if it came doused in a heavy 
dose of sarcasm.
“We’re really good guys, I 
swear we’re really good,” he said, 
as Michigan took possession.
Seconds later, junior guard 
Zavier Simpson snuck behind 
the Hoosier defense to score an 
uncontested layup and make it 
12-0.
Connor’s next words?
“WHAT THE FUCK WAS 
THAT?!”
The dismay returned after 
the 
under-16 
media 
timeout 
— 
highlighted 
by 
Connor 
exclaiming, “Wow we have a 
good team at this school. Who 
knew?” when the jumbotron 
introduced 
the 
Hoosiers’ 

national champion cheer team 
— when Indiana forward Juwan 
Morgan bounced a pass off the 
courtside advertising boards.
As the Wolverines got the ball 
back, another voice behind me 
pled for Michigan to “Just hit a 
fucking dagger. End our misery 
right now.”
Redshirt 
junior 
forward 
Charles 
Matthews 
promptly 
obliged, draining a wing three 
to put the Wolverines up 15-0. 
The misery, though, did not end 
there.
“Just give me one bucket 
please,” Connor begged two 
possessions later, after the deficit 
had ballooned to 17. His pleas 
were predictably met by the 
Hoosiers’ fourth turnover in five 
possessions.
“It’s just an inept offense,” said 

Indiana coach Archie Miller after 
the game, providing a cleaner 
version of the students’ dismay. 
“Inept. I mean, you can’t get 
down 20-2 against Michigan.”
Though 
a 
pair 
of 
free 
throws got the Hoosiers on the 
scoreboard at the 12:57 mark, the 
frustration persisted.
The jumbotron — seemingly 
dedicated to distracting Indiana 
fans from their misery — provided 
a look at the school’s new $17 
million dollar wrestling arena, 
as the students rained scattered 
boos toward the announcement.
“Can we please put our money 
toward a new basketball team?” 
Connor pleaded. “Thank you!”
As an and-one from Brazdeikis 
expanded Michigan’s lead yet 
again, 
the 
student 
section’s 
despair turned macro.

“Can’t 
wait 
to 
lose 
our 
tournament 
bid,” 
shouted 
someone a few rows back.
“To 
the 
NIT?” 
Caleb 
responded — a thought that 
would have seemed insane just 
six games ago, when Indiana 
went to Ann Arbor ranked 21st in 
the country. It hasn’t won since.
So, when an Aljami Durham 
airball prompted the kid in front 
of me to order an Uber before 
the halftime buzzer had even 
sounded, it was hard to blame 
him.
A few plays later, the girl to my 
right made her way to the exit 
and never returned. At halftime, 
a steady exodus followed.
And unless they really wanted 
to be present for a resounding 
chorus of “Fuck you” and “Fuck 
this,” they didn’t miss much.

The Indiana student section reached an extreme level of frustration as the Hoosiers fell down 17-0 to Michigan on Friday, starting what became an embarrassing 69-46 loss to the Wolverines.

Wolverines lead from tipoff to buzzer in 69-46 win over Hoosiers

 
BLOOMINGTON 
— 
Two 
Indiana 
defenders 
converged 
around Zavier Simpson as he 
dribbled inside the arc. Suddenly 
and inexplicably, they were gone.
The junior point guard took 
another dribble and tossed in an 
easy layup. Hoosier coach Archie 
Miller stormed onto the court, 
unable to call a timeout fast enough.
A once-raucous crowd stood 
shell-shocked. Michigan had taken 
a 12-0 lead within the game’s first 
four minutes.
It would somehow get worse for 
the Hoosiers.
Indiana’s first points came at the 
12:57 mark, already down by 17. It 
needed almost three more minutes 
to get its first field goal.
While 
the 
Hoosiers 
self-
destructed, 
the 
fifth-ranked 
Wolverines (19-1 overall, 8-1 Big 
Ten) continued to play basketball. 
They cruised to a 69-46 win that, 
thanks to an opening sequence that 
sent Assembly Hall into a fugue, 
rarely seemed even that close.
“We were just so mentally 
prepared for this game,” said 
freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis. “We watched a lot of 
film on them, we knew exactly 
what we had to do defensively and 
offensively. None of us were shying 
away from shots. … We were really 
confident in ourselves and we were 
ready to go.”
For a moment, the Hoosiers had 
hope. After being booed off the 
floor at halftime — the result of a 
33-18 deficit and a 5-for-25 shooting 
display — Indiana (12-8, 3-6) came 
out of the break energized. A 
3-pointer by Rob Phinisee three 
minutes into the second half cut 
the deficit to single-digits and 
restored life to the arena.
Just 
as 
quickly, 
however, 
Michigan snuffed it out. Brazdeikis, 
who led all scorers with 20, threw 
a stiff-arm by calmly nailing a 
catch-and-shoot trey on the next 
possession to push the lead back 
above double-digits. It would stay 
there for the rest of the night.

The Wolverines continued to 
create distance. Redshirt junior 
forward Charles Matthews, who 
finished with a double-double, 
scored seven points in 70 seconds 
to make the score 48-32, while 
the Hoosiers suffered through 
multiple droughts of over three 
minutes without scoring.
“They might score two and then 
we make a three, and then we get 
a rebound, we make a three,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. “All 
of a sudden I look and we’re back to 
16 or 18. That’s really hard to come 
back from.”
These two teams met on Jan. 
6 in Ann Arbor. In that game, 
the Wolverines also stormed to a 
17-point lead within 10 minutes and 
won, 74-63.
This 
was 
different. 
The 
first meeting was a nationally 
televised battle of two teams 
with sights on a Big Ten title 
and a deep run in March. That 
was a Michigan explosion after 
a lethargic month of December. 
That was the Wolverines hitting 
big shots, jumping passing lanes 
and throwing down dunks in 
transition.
Friday night, by contrast, saw 
Indiana come in on a five-game 
losing streak that began with the 
loss three weeks ago. This was 
a struggling squad desperately 
needing a resume-booster and 
injection of energy. This was 
the Hoosiers not getting it at all, 
appearing sluggish and half-awake 
instead. This was a nightmare 
performance at the worst possible 
time, a plunge further into a 
month-long abyss.
The performance of star guard 
Romeo 
Langford, 
an 
almost-
Messianic figure in Bloomington, 
was representative of the entire 
night. The freshman committed 
three early fouls and never found 
his rhythm, totally stifled by 
Matthews. He scored just nine 
points on 3-of-12 shooting.
“They came in here and did 
what they wanted, when they 
wanted, 
how 
they 
wanted,” 
Miller said. “Our team in general 
right now is soft. We’re also, for 

whatever reason, scared. You could 
just tell by the way that we played. 
Fight isn’t there right now and the 
confidence isn’t there on either end 
of the floor.”
Even Assembly Hall wasn’t 
ready. A clock malfunction just 
seven seconds into the game led to 
a six-minute delay. The shot clock 
on one side of the court never got 
going, forcing PA announcer Chuck 
Crabb to shout out the time at five-
second intervals.
“That place was charged up 
like I remember it was in (2013) 
when we came here as the number 
one team in the country and you 
couldn’t hear yourself think,” 
Beilein said. “And our kids went out 
and just executed. Says a lot about 
who they are and how they adjust.”
Michigan 
adjusted 
to 
the 
delay with a series of punches. 
Brazdeikis nailed a corner three on 
the first possession. Simpson used a 
hesitation dribble to blow by for an 
easy bucket. Matthews hit a triple 
off an Indiana turnover.
The Hoosiers were unable to 
do the same. After the Wolverines 
extinguished Indiana’s second-half 
run, it never threatened again.
When the final buzzer sounded, 
you could hear a pin drop in the 
storied arena.

BLOOMINGTON — Charles 
Matthews stood in the back of 
Crisler Center’s media room on 
Tuesday night, wearing a sly smile 
and a sober tone. A little earlier, 
the redshirt junior had won a 
game for Michigan, hanging in 
the air for what seemed like a 
millisecond too long as ball found 
net, the buzzer sounded and the 
Wolverines avoided disaster.
You wouldn’t have known it 
from talking to him. Michigan had 
let Minnesota inch back into the 
game until it was the Wolverines 
who had their backs against the 
wall. That was what Matthews 
cared about.
“Usually, we all have a saying,” 
he said. “We usually come out 
to the game looking, we be like, 
‘Alright, let’s run ‘em out the gym.’ 
And we usually put our foot on 
their neck and touch it to the floor. 
But this game, they made some big 
shots.”
The subtext: We let them make 
some big shots.
Four nights later, as 17,222 fans 
at Assembly Hall rose to their 
feet, the Hoosiers having slowly 
cut into a Wolverines’ lead until a 

domineering performance again 
turned into a single-digit game, 
a defender collapsed off Ignas 
Brazdeikis and the ball found the 
freshman forward in the corner. 
The ensuing shot found bottom.
The ensuing run — keyed 
by Matthews, who responded 
to a literal kick in the head by 
scoring seven straight points and 
continuing to make Indiana’s 
Romeo Langford his plaything 
on defense — put 
away an eventual 
69-46 win.
The Hoosiers, 
who came into 
Friday’s 
game 
the losers of five 
straight, 
then 
started 
it 
by 
embarrassing 
themselves 
and letting the 
Wolverines jump 
out to a 17-0 run, had every reason 
to throw all the effort they had 
into the second half. If that was 
what they did, it didn’t matter.
“At the end of the day, I felt 
like the energy’s gonna change,” 
said junior guard Zavier Simpson. 
“Once we see Charles doing that 
(to Langford), it kinda rubs off to 
myself, rubs off to Iggy, rubs off to 

the rest of the floor, players on the 
floor. We see that. We feed off that. 
Just keep it going.”
The thing about a 17-0 start, 
whether it be on the season or 
in an individual game: it lends 
itself to complacency. On Friday, 
Michigan refused to fall into that 
trap.
This game could have easily 
gotten close. The Wolverines 
suffered multiple offensive lulls. 
The crowd stayed 
in it until the very 
end. 
Indiana’s 
chances 
were 
there. Michigan 
didn’t let it take 
them.
“I don’t think 
anyone 
realizes 
as a coach how 
you 
envy 
that 
situation 
where 
you got off to a 
great start, how difficult that is 
to manage,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “When you get off 
to that great start, what happens 
in the game, if you lose that game, 
it’s nothing. To up that much that 
early. Nothing. To manage and 
have your kids persevere through 
it is really good, especially when 
they make that little run to get to 
10.”
That’s a product of a culture 
instilled 
by 
Matthews 
and 
Simpson and Beilein — one of 
accountability, that doesn’t allow 
satisfaction to creep in after a poor 
performance that happens to have 
a W next to it.
“We 
maintain 
(intensity),” 
Simpson said. “Look at what 
we control, know our scouting 
reports. Get the Xs and Os from 
coaches. Just maintain it. There’s 
no special or secret ingredient to 
what we do. We just play together, 
listen to the coaches and do things 
we can control.”
Simpson 
was 
then 
asked 
whether that had been a particular 
focus this week.
“It’s emphasized every single 
day,” he said.
This week, two completely 
different games proved him right.
