With 13 days until the general 

election, tensions were high 
as 
Michigan’s 
gubernatorial 

hopefuls convened for their 
final debate Wednesday night. 
Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, 
former state Senate minority 
leader, 
and 
Republican 
Bill 

Schuette, 
state 
attorney 

general, exchanged blows over 
immigration, higher education, 
environmental 
issues 
and 

infrastructure.

Whitmer’s campaign frames 

her as a pragmatist, is currently 
leading by double digits in the 
latest polls against Schuette, 
who has branded himself as the 

“jobs governor.”

Schuette’s critique of Whitmer 

centered around her time in 
the political “establishment.” 
Schuette repeated Whitmer’s 
political career in the state 
Senate multiple times, saying 
she only passed three bills in 14 
years –– a report card “not good 
enough for Michigan.” He also 
emphasized he sees Whitmer’s 
policies as “extreme,” painting 
her platform as an “economic 
collapse plan.” Throughout the 
debate, he circled back to his 
“Paycheck Plan” for economic 
growth.

“I want Michigan to be a 

jobs state, a growth state and a 
paycheck state.”

Whitmer focused on her 

As part of their “High 

Stakes Culture” series, the 
Institute of the Humanities 
and 
the 
Humanities 

Collaboratory 
hosted 
an 

event Wednesday afternoon 
titled “How Did We Become 
a Troll Nation and What Can 
Humanists Do About It?” 
Four panelists, ranging from 
an 
academic 
to 
software 

entrepreneurs, were joined 
by about 50 students, faculty 
and other audience members 
at 
North 
Quad 
Residence 

Hall for a discussion on the 
increasing toxicity of online 
platforms.

The 
event 
began 
with 

moderator 
Angela 
Dillard, 

LSA 
Undergraduate 

Education Associate Dean, 
asking audience members to 
discuss with people sitting 
near them about what drew 
them to the event and what 
they hoped to learn more 
about that afternoon.

A troll, panelists explained, 

is a member of a digital 
community that intentionally 
mocks or harasses others.

Amy 
Dawson-Andoh, 
a 

fifth-year 
communications 

study 
Ph.D. 
candidate 

argued despite the opinion 
that online platforms are 
neutral, she believes sites 
are inevitably influenced by 
the bias of the people who 
use them. In support of her 

claim, she spoke of her own 
experiences with trolling in 
the gaming community.

Panel 
member 
Kamilah 

Taylor 
concurred 
with 

Dawson-Andoh, 
further 

speaking about trolling in 
the gaming community and 
social media. In response to 
toxic digital culture, Taylor 
and panel member Daniel 
Burke 
co-founded 
Swaay, 

an app currently in private 

beta meant to foster diverse 
and civil discussion. The app 
purposely incentivizes such 
behavior by asking users to 
consider 
whether 
opinions 

are thoughtful or not before 
asking 
if 
they 
agree 
or 

disagree. Users are also able 
to have private conversations 
with other users who hold 
different opinions.

Burke explained the main 

goal of the platform as well 

as meaningful online activity 
should not be to convince 
other people of a point-of-
view, but to first listen to how 
the opposing opinion was 
formed.

“There 
was 
a 
question 

earlier about the difference 
between an opinion or an 
argument. I hope to create a 
place, a safe place, for both, 
where someone can just say a

Gutiérrez Soto and his son 
Oscar had an immigration 
hearing in El Paso, Texas 
as part of their effort to be 
granted

Gutiérrez 

and his son have been seeking

Officials from Immigration

Beckett, presented Gutiérrez 
and his son’s case. Gutiérrez 
initially began seeking asylum 
in 2008, fleeing the country 
upon 
discovering 
that 
his 

name was on a military hit list 
after writing an article about 
soldiers robbing a hotel.

Brown said the responsibility 

of the University extends beyond 
housing for students on campus, 
encompassing off campus issues 
as well.

“It is the University’s job 

and therefore the regents’ job 
to make sure that housing and 
food is affordable for students 

during their whole education

University or Board of Regents 
to say, ‘Well, we gave them 
relatively affordable dorms as

think that’s a cop-out.”

The University of Michigan 

released 
a 
statement 

Wednesday 
announcing 

the University will amend 
its policy on student sexual 
misconduct to incorporate an 
in-person hearing where the 
students involved in the sexual 
misconduct 
investigation 

can ask questions to each 
other 
and 
witnesses. 
The 

amendment comes after the 
recent U.S. Sixth Circuit Court 
of Appeals ruling, which states 
public universities “must give 
the accused student or his 
agent an opportunity to cross-
examine the accuser.”

Following this ruling, the 

University petitioned for a 
rehearing 
from 
the 
Sixth 

Circuit panel that edited the 
decision to clarify no student 
has the right to a direct cross-
examination. 
This 
request 

for a rehearing was denied. 
If the University decides not 
to appeal the ruling to the 
Supreme Court, the ruling 
will apply to all colleges and 
universities in the Sixth Circuit

including 
Michigan, 
Ohio, 

Kentucky 
and 
Tennessee, 

thus 
requiring 
them 
to 

reconfigure their procedures 
for sexual assault hearings 
and investigations

In 
the 
University’s 

amended policy, the in-person 
hearing will be facilitated by 
a trained officer. The details 
of the policy expected to 
be released later this fall 
are still being ironed out. 
As of now, officials offer 
students involved in sexual 
misconduct cases, as opposed 
to their advisers, will likely 
be required to ask questions 
at their hearing.

In the Public Affairs press 

release detailing this policy 
revision, 
Jeffery 
Frumkin, 

the new interim Title IX 

coordinator 
and 
senior 

director at the Office for 
Institutional 
Equity, 
said 

OIE will try to maintain as 
sensitive and informed of a 
process as possible while still 
being in accordance with the 
ruling.

“We 
believe 
that 
an 

appropriate 
and 
lawful 

hearing model is one in which 
cross-examination is allowed, 
but in a less intrusive, more 
trauma-informed 
manner 

that allows parties to submit 
written 
questions 
through 

a neutral hearing officer to 
ask of the other party and 
witnesses,” 
Frumkin 
said. 

“However, 
we 
will 
move 

forward with the process that 
best meets the needs of our 
community as well as adheres 
to the new requirement.”

The changes to this policy 

will be considered temporary 
for a period of time while the 
University determines how 

the community assesses the 
effectiveness of the policy. 
The policy was last revised in 

Februrary 
to 
broaden 

definitions of gender-
based 
harassment 

and 
intimate 
partner 

violence. 

In appealing the Sixth 

Circuit’ original ruling, 
the University filed a 
brief argued a cross-
examination 
process 

could create a hostile 
environment for both 
parties. 

“Requiring 

universities 
to 
allow 

cross-examination 
by 

counsel 
will 
convert 

disciplinary proceedings 
into 
full-scale 

adversarial 
hearings, 

with 
the 
university 

forced to preside,” the 
University’s brief read. 

“Moreover, the panel opinion 
introduces new opportunities 
for 
unfairness, 
with 

economically 
advantaged 

parties 
likely 
represented 

by 
counsel, 
and 
others 

essentially 
appearing 
pro 

se or with only non-lawyer 
family members or support 
persons.” 

By the end of September, 

however, 
another 
brief 

filed indicated adminstrators 
would move forward with 
the live hearing model. 

“(The University) is no 

longer contesting whether 
the 
investigative 
model 

they have used to date is 
sufficient, and understand 
that 
they 
must 
provide 

students in Title IX cases 
with a live hearing including 
cross-examination,” 
the 

filing reads. 

Public Policy senior Lena 

Dreves told The Daily last 
month she feels the Sixth 
Circuit’s 
decision 
poses 

significant issues, especially 
if 
students 
are 
allowed 

to bring in a professional 
advocate.

“(T)he 
University 
must 

take the lead when it comes 
to 
defending 
the 
most 

financially 
vulnerable 

students 
on 
campus, 

especially those who may 
not be able to hire a lawyer,” 
Dreves wrote in an email. 
“It is incorrect to assume 
that 
due-process 
cannot 

be accomplished by a third 
party 
cross 
examination. 

These are not full-on judicial 
proceedings, nor should they 
be. To allow the accuser the 
option of hiring a lawyer 
and directly confronting the 
accused would not only add 
complexities 
for 
survivors 

coming 
forward, 
but 
it 

would give advantages to 
the ‘financially better off’ 
student.”

Requiring 

universities to 
allow cross-
examination 
by counsel 
will convert 
disciplinary 
proceedings 
into full-scale 

adversarial 

hearings, with 
the university 
president forced 

to preside


deadline 
to 
produce 

documents explaining why 
he was detained. During this 
time, the Knight-Wallace 
Fellowship, 
a 
University 

program 
managed 
by 

Wallace House that allows 
mid-career journalists to 
spend an academic year at 
the University, advocated 
for his release and accepted 
him as a fellow for the 2018-
2019 school year. Gutiérrez 
and his son have been living 
in Ann Arbor since the 
beginning of his fellowship 
in September.

Judge Robert Hough, the 

current presiding judge on 
the case, denied Gutiérrez’s 
asylum 
request 
in 
July 

2017, but later reinstated 
the appeal. Wallace House 
Director Lynette Clemetson 
said 
the 
family 
should 

know the results of the case 
by January. Hough also 
denied earlier requests to 
change the hearing venue 
to Michigan, a mandate 
that Beckett has taken to 
indicate 
an 
unjust 
bias 

against Gutiérrez.

Beckett cited the lack 

of consideration of new 
material evidence as his 
first indication of injustice. 
He described the allegedly 
ignored evidence filed in 
the 
appeals 
court, 
such 

as updatedexpert data on 
conditions in Mexico that 
show 47 reporters have 
been killed in the country 
since 
1992, 
and 
letters 

of support from various 
prominent news outlets and 
organizations.

“I 
strongly 
believe 

that 
Judge 
Hough 
has 

prejudged the case. He’s 
done 
everything 
in 
his 

power 
to 
minimize 
it. 

Judges are kind of like the 
gatekeepers of cases, they 
admit and exclude evidence, 
they decide whose credible 
and who is not,” Beckett 
said. “Back in May, we won 
Emilio’s appeal to have the 
judge review new material 
evidence 
that 
was 
not 

available before that was 
very important to the case. 
All the evidence that was 
submitted should’ve been 
with Judge Hough on Oct 
22, and he barely has it. That 
seems very reckless, that’s 
never happened to me.”

Kathy Kiely, Lee Hills 

Chair in free press studies at 
the University of Missouri 
School of Journalism and 
National Press Club freedom 
fellow, spearheaded NPC’s 
effort to gather evidence of 
Gutiérrez’s past journalistic 
work. 
She 
tweeted 
a 

document detailing letters 
of support from the NPC, 
Radio-Television 
Digital 

News Association and the 

National 
Association 
of 

Hispanic Journalists.

Beckett 
claimed 
that 

despite a strong testimony 
from Clemetson in support 
Gutiérrez’s asylum request, 
her efforts were not taken 
into 
account. 
Clemetson 

joined the two for a hearing 
in August and on Monday. 

“When Lynette joined us 

in August, she came in good 
faith to introduce herself, 
to meet the judge, to tell 
him about her program, 
and 
the 
judge 
wouldn’t 

even acknowledge her in 
the courtroom and told 
me it was irrelevant. And 
to me, that was a sign of 
disrespect, at that moment 
I told the judge that it was 
in the interest of justice 
and 
Emilio’s 
fellowship, 

which is not just some 
small 
accomplishment, 

that this case should no 
longer be before him, and 
that it should be moved to 
Michigan,” 
Beckett 
said. 

“He later said, ‘I don’t care 
if you turn blue, I’m not 
letting go of this case.’”

Clemetson echoed many 

of Beckett’s sentiments.

“I was able to testify. 

Emilio was able to testify. It 
was clear that the judge did 
not consider our testimony 
at all,” she said. “After 
everything that happened, 
it was our assumption that 
we 
were 
testifying 
not 

just to the judge but to the 
appeals court, because the 
judge had indicated that our 
testimonies were not going 
to change the way he saw 
the case.”

Clemetson 
said 
while 

they are appreciative the 
two can return to Ann Arbor 
for the time being, the team 
still has a long way to go 
before Gutiérrez and his son 
will have secure status.

“The sad thing is that the 

judge has always had the 
power to grant asylum to 
Emilio and Oscar, and while 
this further delay means 
that he can come back to 
Michigan, a much better 
outcome would’ve been that 
the judge look at all of the 
evidence and grant asylum 
for this journalist whose life 
is in danger,” she said. “That 
was the desired outcome 
yesterday, and we certainly 
hope that the ruling in 
January reflects that he 
has gone through all of the 
evidence presented, which 
at this point addresses every 
concern that he expressed 
in his first ruling. There 
should be ample evidence 
to allow him to reach a 
different 
conclusion 
this 

time, but if he doesn’t and 
if he denies asylum a second 
time, I am certain that 
Emilio’s lawyers are going 
to pursue the appeal.”

thing,” Burke said. “This is just 
something that I’m feeling, or 
to even describe. I’m not going 
to make a comment right now, 
but I’m going to tell you how my 
frame of reference was built. 
I’m going to tell you where I’m 
coming from as I enter into this 
conversation. The intention is 
not to change someone’s mind. 
There’s no winning.”

Panel member Rachel Rohr, a 

Knight-Wallace fellow, spoke of 
her experience with trolls while 
managing the digital side of a 
show on National Public Radio. 
She discussed how her show 
was unique among others for 
having a particularly healthy 
comment section. In order to 
achieve this, she shared that 
she dedicated time every day 
to read every comment. If a 
commenter violated community 
guidelines, she would redact 
or delete their comment in 
addition to explaining to them 

why she did so. She spoke of 
how her presence itself altered 
behavior, 
for 
people 
knew 

she was there monitoring the 
conversation.

However, she also noted such 

an approach had its limitations 
due to subjectivity. She also 
spoke of how such a solution 
was only necessary because 
the 
structural 
features 
of 

the comment section could 
not 
prevent 
trolling, 
and 

how ultimately it is not ideal 
because it is not sustainable nor 
scalable.

Overall, 
much 
of 
the 

discussion 
referenced 
ideas 

raised 
by 
fourth 
panel 

member 
Megan 
Ankerson, 

a 
communications 
studies 

associate 
professor. 
She 

outlined many of the main 
difficulties 
with 
changing 

online 
dialogue 
relate 
to 

questions of labor, or who 
moderates the exchanges, and 
architecture or how the design 
of a platform could prevent 
trolling.

Ankerson 
concluded 

solutions must address both 

the 
technological 
and 
the 

human. In the last remarks of 
the evening, she envisions the 
kind of common space online 
environments should be.

“I think, as someone that 

comes 
from 
communication 

studies, that this is a really 
important connection between 
community 
and 
common, 

and having a space where 
we 
don’t 
necessarily 
have 

our 
opinions 
in 
common, 

but a space in which we can 
debate questions of common 
concern, in order to, you know, 
communicate,” Ankerson said.

Dawson-Andoh 
said 
the 

point that resonated with her 
the most was the discussion of 
exactly how online culture can 
be reshaped.

“I think the question of labor, 

and how you’re to moderate 
online spaces if you want to, you 
know, deal with (this) problem 
with this problem of toxicity, 
not 
just 
trolling, 
not 
just 

individuals, because toxicity is 
an entire environment – How 
do we stop that?” Dawson-
Andoh said.

Event 
organizer 
Kristin 

Hass, the faculty coordinator of 
the Humanities Collaboratory, 
explained 
the 
event 
was 

designed to encourage audience 
engagement, particularly from 
undergraduate students.

“People in the humanities 

have 
a 
lot 
to 
contribute 

to try and understand the 
world, and that wouldn’t it 
be cool to provide a space for 
undergraduates to get in on 
the conversation, so that we 
weren’t just inviting people to 
come and give a lecture,” Hass 
said. “The intent (of the event) 
was to provide an opportunity 
for undergraduates to talk to, 
to have a real exchange with 
faculty and actors in the world 
who are trying to address a big 
problem that matters to a lot of 
us.”

Ankerson 
also 
mentioned 

the Humanities Collaboratory 
is planning to host another 
High Stakes Culture event next 
semester and were looking 
for student input on potential 
topics.

ASYLUM

One 
of 
the 
questions 

submitted 
asked 
if 
the 

University 
could 
build 
new 

student housing on land the 
University 
currently 
owns, 

making 
it 
environmentally 

friendly and low cost.

Acker 
responded 
the 

University 
has 
allowed 
the 

private sector to build in parts 
of campus like S. University 
Street 
and 
students 
pay 
a 

substantial amount to live in a 
good location.

“I think there’s an element of 

planning that needs to go on,” 
Acker said. “When I hear the 
amount that people are paying 

for housing close to campus, it’s 
become such a premium that it’s 
really ridiculous.”

Rabhi added the University 

has land that is underutilized 
currently in parts of North 
Campus, especially near Baits.

“The 
University 
has 
a 

considerable amount of land 
up there,” Rabhi said. “Some of 
the more underutilized land the 
University has is some of the 
Northwood developments where 
there’s vast swaths of mowed 
grass that could be potentially 
utilized for University students 
that are housed and families.”

Another question mentioned 

a U-M Dearborn survey that 
collected 
data 
on 
student 

housing and food insecurity. 
The question posed whether 
similar 
information 
would 

become available for Ann Arbor 
and whether any action would 
be taken.

Brown 
said 
the 
lack 
of 

information 
on 
Ann 
Arbor 

would 
make 
improving 
or 

helping 
these 
marginalized 

populations difficult.

“I can’t believe there hasn’t 

been a survey,” Brown said. 
“How do you understand the 
group you’re trying to serve if 
you don’t have the data?”

Rabhi added a Washtenaw 

County perspective, mentioning 
there is data and information 
available 
on 
homeless 

populations in the county but 
not so much for students.

“The county Human Service 

net knows a lot about hunger 
in the community,” Rabhi said. 
“But there’s a lot of gaps when it 

comes to the student population 
in particular.”

Rabhi also mentioned money 

the county receives for these 
populations takes into account 
low-income students.

Many questions brought up 

also dealt with the changing 
socioeconomic demographic of 
the University, including how 
large parts of the state may view 
the University as expensive 
and inaccessible. The median 
income 
at 
the 
University 

measures at $154,000. 

Brown 
compared 
the 

differences of students who 
attend the University based on 
county.

social 
policies 
rather 
than 

economic policies and restated 
Schuette’s ties to the Flint water 
crisis and lawsuits he filed to 
dismantle the Affordable Care 
Act. She promised to work across 
the aisle, citing a turbulent 
political climate.

“Bill Schuette and I couldn’t be 

more different.”

Environmental Issues
Water 
policy 
issues 
such 

as the Flint water crisis, the 
Detroit Public Schools water 
crisis, the Line 5 deal in the 
Straits of Mackinac, per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
substance 

issues and the Nestlé water 
deal saturated the debate on 
protecting 
Michigan’s 
largest 

natural resource.

Whitmer promised to create a 

department that would oversee 
contaminants and use of the 
natural resource and denounced 

the deal with Nestlé Waters North 
America, which would allow the 
company to pump 76,000 gallons 
of water per day from Michigan 
for $200 a year. She said Schuette 
is confusing recreational water 
policy with the fundamental right 
to clean drinking water –– a right 
she promised to uphold.

“It is appalling the state of 

water and the lack of safety in our 
water,” Whitmer said.

Whitmer also vowed to enter 

Michigan 
into 
an 
alternate 

climate alliance until the Trump 
administration enters the nation 
back into the Paris climate accord, 
and said it’s time for Michigan 
to lean into renewable energy 
sources.

Schuette said the government 

needs to make sure “solid science” 
is being used before formulating 
policy. Whitmer said Schuette’s 
views on the legitimacy climate 
change are different when the 
“cameras are off,” but Schuette 
expressed otherwise.

“Climate change is real and 

Earth is getting warmer and we 
need to make sure every nation is 
part of the solution,” she said. 

Education
Schuette said he plans to 

“grade” schools on a scale of A 
through F to give families more 
transparency in school quality, 
reward schools with incentive 
grants and create a literacy 
director to create a “culture of 
reading in Michigan.”

“When 
I’m 
governor, 

Michigan’s children will read,” he 
said.

Whitmer, 
who 
Schuette 

contended is captive to the 
“education 
establishment,” 

said she wants universal early 
childhood education, improving 
treatment of educators and to 
triple the number of literacy 
coaches. 
She 
said 
Michigan 

teachers are demoralized.

“It’s 
no 
wonder 
teachers 

support me,” Whitmer said. “You 
know why? Because I support 
teachers.”

In terms of tuition, both 

candidates agreed high education 
is currently too costly. But while 
Whitmer proposed solving this 
issue by creating a scholarship 
plan that would provide a debt-
free two-year degree, Schuette 
promised to focus on building up 
trade schools and apprenticeships. 
He said workers with trade skills 
are needed in Michigan, and their 
success can be bolstered by a 
stronger economy.

“The best approach for high 

school and college is a strong 
economy,” Schuette said. “We 
need to make sure that high 
school graduates are career-ready 
and workforce-ready.”

Whitmer also touched on the 

lack of workers in skilled trades 
and 
said 
Michigan’s 
“talent 

gap” contributed to Detroit not 
making the short list of locations 
for Amazon to build a second 
headquarters.

“We have to prioritize meeting 

the skills gap by making sure 
everyone has a path to a skill,” she 
said.

LGBTQ Rights
Recently, 
the 
Trump 

administration 
announced 

a possible legal definiton of 
sex that excludes transgender 
Americans, 
bolstering 
the 

debate regarding whether or not 
Michigan’s Elliott-Larsen Civil 
Rights Act should be expanded to 
make LGBTQ people a protected 
class.

Schuette said he will make 

sure Michigan is a state free from 
discrimination, and that the best 
way to assist in creating equality 
is by making sure Michigan has 
a strong economy, reiterating his 
economic goals.

Whitmer said she supports 

amending 
the 
Elliott-Larsen 

Civil 
Rights 
Act. 
Citing 

lawsuits Schuette brought forth 
against gay marriage, Whitmer 
said Schuette would be the “most 
anti-LGBTQ governor Michigan 
has ever had.”

“I believe that it is time for 

Michigan to get on the right side 
of history –– this is 2018,” she 

said.

Immigration
Since 
the 
Trump 

administration 
took 
office, 

Michigan has seen a 75 percent 
decrease in legal refugee arrivals 
–– a national low. Whitmer said 
she sees this statistic as a negative 
product 
of 
fear 
mongering 

from Schuette and Trump. She 
expressed heartbreak over the 
family separation policy that was 
in effect over the summer and 
said she is running to combat the 
“nasty rhetoric” coming from 
Schuette.

“Michigan 
was 
built 
by 

immigrants,” she said. “It’s a 
strength that we have.”

Schuette emphasized border 

security, saying if he were elected, 
he would not allow sanctuary 
cities. 
He 
said 
Whitmer’s 

immigration views are extreme, 
and that if she were elected, 
Michigan 
would 
become 
a 

sanctuary state and that she would 
work to abolish Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement.

Marching Band alumni raise funds 
in support of survivors of assault

Following claims of harassment in SMTD, campaign diverts money from school

After the Michigan Daily 

published the story of a School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance 
student’s experience reporting 
a Graduate Student Instructor 
for sexual assault, University 
of Michigan Marching Band 
alumni are diverting money 
from donations to SMTD and 
MMB towards sexual assault 
awareness programs instead.

A 
GoFundMe 
campaign 

started last night at 7 p.m., 
and has already surpassed its 
goal of raising $1,972 for the 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center at U-M. The 
donation total is growing as 
The Daily writes this update. 
At the time of publication, there 
are more than 412 shares on 
Facebook, 74 donations, and a 
total of $2,182 raised.

The 
campaign 
organizers 

decided the fundraising goal 
would represent the year that 
women were first allowed to 
join the Michigan Marching 

Band in 1972.

“We have always donated 

to the MMB hoping that more 
students will have the life 
changing experience that we 
had as members of the MMB,” 
MMB alumni Donald and Heidi 
Amadek wrote on the campaign 
page. 
“Our 
experience 
was 

not sexual assault. For an 
organization 
dedicated 
to 

music, a tone deaf response is 
unacceptable, and we hope that 
by donating to SAPAC that we 
can show the victims that we 
hear them, believe them and 

support them.”

As the GoFundMe trends, 

campaign 
organizers 
wrote 

they hope to put pressure on 
STMD and MMB to act in the 
best interests of students.

“Now, as alumni, we compel 

the MMB and SMTD to hold 
themselves 
to 
those 
same 

high standards and set an 
example for all members of 
the University of Michigan 
community that there is no 
place for sexual harassment 
and assault on our campus,” the 
campaign reads.

Y

ou could go swimming 
right now, but you 
didn’t necessarily plan 
on it. You knew it was going 
to rain, but did you expect 
giant puddles to swallow the 
sidewalk, the road or your 
shoes for that matter? In this 
beautifully constructed city 
that we call home, the last 
thing that we think about is its 
imperfection. Ann Arbor, new 
and old, consists of aesthetic, 
impressive architecture and 
infrastructure that not only 
meets the logistical demands 
of the city, but also perfectly 
complements the abundant 
natural 
scenery 
that 
surrounds it. Nevertheless, 
what if I told you that’s not 
good enough?
When vast puddles form 
after one mild rain in areas 
around 
campus 
that 
are 
frequently occupied by foot 
traffic, 
one 
consequence, 
among many, of an ineffective 
stormwater system becomes 
completely 
obvious. 
The 
design 
of 
our 
current 
stormwater 
and 
sewer 
systems 
pertain 
to 
past 
observations of precipitation 
and land use which have 
evidently shifted over time 
with changing climate and 
urbanization. Thus, what we 
can truly recognize is that 
the city of Ann Arbor has 
always considered molding 
public infrastructure in a 
way that best suits the needs 
of the times. Now, it’s time 
that it continues taking steps 
toward executing plans to 
renovate 
infrastructure 
in a way that supports the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
goals 
for 
sustainability 
while 
maintaining 
strong 
output 
in 
all 
important 
economic 
sectors. 
Perhaps 
more 
importatly, 
strong 
infrastructure 
and 
the 
removal of excess stormwater 
has 
exponential 
effects 
for 
our 
environment, 
particularly when it comes to 
preventing erosion and water 
contamination. 
In 
order 
to 
do 
this 
effectively, the city has to 
have a particular mentality 
already 
reflected 
in 
those 
who 
specialize 
in 
environmental 
and 
urban 
sustainability. 
Branko 
Kerkez, assistant professor 
of Civil and Environmental 
Engineering, is the leader 
of a national research team 
organized under the National 
Science Foundation’s Smart 
& Connected Communities 
program. 
This 
team 
is 
composed of researchers from 
various 
other 
institutions 
who are investigating the use 
of smart stormwater systems 
in 
reducing 
flooding 
and 
improving water quality. In 

essence, Kerkez is looking to 
improve the functionality of 
current stormwater systems 
by implementing sensors and 
other autonomous technology 
to enhance system capacity 
during large storm events. 
However, 
rather 
than 
completely 
replace 
old 
infrastructure, 
Kerkez 
emphasizes the benefits and 
practicality of implementing 
green 
infrastructure 
into 
existing 
infrastructure: 
“Instead of saying new and 
expensive construction is our 
only option, can we use what 
we have in a better way?”
The 
sensors 
being 
developed by the research 
team 
are 
multifaceted 
to 
account 
for 
all 
aspects 
of 
water 
passing 
through 
a 
stormwater 
system. 
In 
essence, they will run on 
real-time 
control 
systems 
that 
allow 
a 
stormwater 
system 
to 
enable 
flood 
control 
with 
a 
detention 
basin as well as to enable 
water quality control with 
a retention basin based on 
the precipitation conditions 

present. The research team 
expresses 
confidence 
that 
the hybridization of these 
stormwater 
system 
sites 
will benefit the quality of 
the water and the health 
of the overall surrounding 
ecosystem, 
claiming 
that 
temporarily 
converting 
a 
detention basin to a retention 
basin and vice versa can 
increase 
the 
removal 
efficiency of total suspended 
solids 
by 
60 
percent. 
In 
addition, sensors will control 
the function of above-ground 
and underground valves for 
the system to most effectively 
regulate groundwater flow 
and measure moisture and 
water quality at any given 
time. As a result, retrofitting 
existing stormwater systems 
with 
cost-effective 
smart 
technology 
will 
give 
the 
overall 
stormwater 
system 
an 
adaptive 
capability 
to 
constantly redesign itself in 
response to changing weather 

conditions.
With this newly designed 
system 
providing 
clear 
benefits for water quality 
and several advantages to the 
functionality of stormwater 
systems, 
it’s 
natural 
to 
agree with the efforts of 
Kerkez 
and 
the 
research 
team in implementing sensor 
technology to enhance this 
aspect of the city; However, 
this doesn’t necessarily mean 
that it’s easy for all of us to 
agree with efforts like these. 
While we as a generation 
have come across countless 
opportunities to improve the 
quality of our surrounding 
environment, we have always 
felt some reluctance toward 
seizing them because they 
often involve a change in 
lifestyle or an advancement 
that feels like it could be too 
advanced for what we’re used 
to. In other words, while it 
is natural to pursue in life 
what is morally correct, it is 
perhaps even more natural 
to remain stagnant and live 
life how we’ve always done 
it. 
I 
believe 
this 
closed-
mindedness 
is 
what 
is 
undermining our local and 
global environment as we 
speak.
Thankfully, the governing 
bodies of the University have 
recognized the importance of 
adjusting our infrastructure 
to suit the environmental 
demands of the times — teams 
from Facilities & Operations 
are currently in the process 
of installing a stormwater 
infiltration system on Central 
Campus 
near 
the 
Diag, 
where the massive ponds of 
water collect during rains. 
However, many institutions 
and industrial corporations 
everywhere 
have 
failed 
to 
take 
similar 
strides 
toward 
managing 
their 
infrastructure effectively in 
relation to the environment. 
Showing 
that 
we 
care 
about creating a healthier 
environment in accordance 
with 
a 
more 
efficient 
infrastructural design is only 
half of the journey, and, for 
most, it’s the only half that 
we have control over. So we 
can leave it to Kerkez and the 
professionals to execute these 
ideals that are progressing 
toward 
sustainability, 
but it’s important that we 
instill these ideals into our 
professionals and authorities 
with an urgency that makes 
them prevalent and necessary 
to be addressed so that we 
as a society can progress our 
environmental and economic 
sectors equally.

When Trump makes landfall
I 

remember 
the 
tweets. 
The (almost too fitting) 
image 
of 
former 
Presidential 
candidate 
Donald 
Trump 
holding up the 
rainbow 
flag 
in front of his 
thousands 
of 
supporters, 
as 
if that colored 
piece 
of 
cloth 
even knew the 
truth 
of 
what 
lay ahead. I even 
remember 
the 
assurances 
of friends and loved ones to 
not worry; Jared and Ivanka 
were sure to serve as a buffer 
between the most powerful 
man in the world and the 
already-fragile 
rights 
that 
had 
just 
delicately 
been 
established.
Yet, 
just 
like 
many 
preceding 
presidential 
administrations, 
a 
people 
to fear — to unite against 
through deep-seated bonds of 
animus — was needed.
While Muslims, those of 
Mexican descent and even 
victims 
of 
sexual 
assault 
were cast aside, a group 
that lawmakers and elected 
officials have exploited for 
the past century as a means to 
elicit political gain once again 
returned to the forefront of 
our chief of state’s vitriol: the 
LGBT community.
Now, 
this 
past 
week, 
reports of a memo by the 
Trump 
Administration 
“to 
establish a legal definition 
of sex under Title IX, the 
federal civil rights law that 
bans gender discrimination 
in 
education 
programs 
that 
receive 
government 
financial 
assistance” 
has 
surfaced. 
This 
narrow 
definition “defining gender 
as a biological, immutable 
condition 
determined 
by 
genitalia at birth,” would 
“eradicate federal recognition 
of the estimated 1.4 million 
Americans who have opted 
to recognize themselves — 
surgically or otherwise — as 
a gender other than the one 
they were born into.”
While this may not come 
as 
a 
surprise 
for 
many, 

the 
administration 
has 
previously moved to limit 
the 
rights 
of 
transgender 
individuals, the memo 
serves as the boldest 
course of action yet to 
strip the transgender 
community — people 
who are our neighbors, 
who pay taxes, who 
serve this country — 
from their respective 
rights 
and 
dignity. 
It further targets an 
already 
vulnerable 
class of citizens that 
faces both legal and societal 
discrimination.
A 
transgender 
student 
on campus, who wished to 
remain anonymous out of fear 
for his identity, spoke about 
the news of the proposed 
memo with grave concern.

“I was hopeful that the 
coming election would bring 
some change for transgender 
people 
in 
the 
state 
(of 
Michigan), and now to know 
the federal government is 
trying to completely — and 
legally — erase us is just so 
terrible.” 
While 
the 
upcoming 
midterm 
elections 
may 
not 
put 
Trump 
and 
his 
administration 
directly 
on 
the ballot, it can serve as a 
first step in electing leaders 
who will fight for the rights 
of all people at both the local 
and national level. Following 
the 
2015 
Supreme 
Court 
decision that legalized same-
sex marriage, the sense of 
urgency among gay people 
— and within the national 

dialogue as a whole — has 
seemed to dissipate. If this 
week has not made it apparent 
enough, the fight for total 
equality in the eyes of the law 
is far from settled.
We are now faced with 
emerging fateful challenges. 
The 
architect 
of 
the 
enshrinement of LGBT rights 
has departed the Supreme 
Court. 
The 
United 
States 
Secretary 
of 
Education 
refuses to act on pertinent 
issues such as transgender 
bathroom 
access. 
The 
supposed-leader of the free 
world, when prompted with 
the issue of gay rights, jokes 
about his own Vice President 
“want(ing) to hang them all!” 
There is now much left to 
wonder where the issue of gay 
rights proceeds from here.
While 
much 
progress 
has been realized in the 
recent past, we cannot grow 
complacent in our current 
state of existence. Nor shall 
we become fearful at the sight 
of such hatred’s re-elevation 
to 
our 
nation’s 
highest 
positions. 
What 
reverberates 
in 
my mind in the face of such 
growing antagonism are the 
words of former President 
Barack 
Obama 
upon 
the 
2015 ruling of Obergefell v. 
Hodges in which same-sex 
marriage was granted across 
the nation: “Progress on this 
journey often comes in small 
increments. Sometimes two 
steps forward, one step back, 
propelled by the persistent 
effort of dedicated citizens. 
And then sometimes there are 
days like this, when that slow, 
steady 
effort 
is 
rewarded 
with justice that arrives like 
a thunderbolt.”
Though 
our 
brooding 
storm may be marked with 
ominous 
precipitation 
and 
despair, through persistence 
and 
unwavering 
solidarity 
with the LGBT community, 
out 
of 
this 
same 
storm 
can 
come 
that 
unbending 
thunderbolt of justice once 
again. 

Ann Arbor is preparing for the storm, are you?

An overshadowed opinion on Israel
W

hen people think 
about 
religious 
diversity 
on 
campus, they may not always 
consider the diversity that 
exists 
within 
religious 
minorities. Since I arrived 
at Michigan, there has been 
one dominant political voice 
coming 
from 
the 
Jewish 
community: a voice which 
does not speak for me.
As a Jewish student who is 
religiously engaged and loves 
celebrating my cultural roots, 
I feel distressed by the toxic 
environment surrounding the 
debate over Israel. Though a 
diversity of opinions exists 
within 
the 
U-M 
Jewish 
community, I’m saddened by 
the fact that many of these 
viewpoints are overshadowed 
by 
a 
vocal, 
conservative-
leaning perspective. And I 
am not alone. The polarized 
political 
dichotomy 
on 
campus excludes the many 
progressive Jews who want 
Israel to exist as a Jewish 
homeland, but are appalled 
by the indifference to the 
suffering 
of 
Palestinian 
civilians in Gaza and the 
West Bank.
I believe calling out the 
current Israeli government for 
its humanitarian violations 
is a political statement, not 
hate speech against Jews. I 

also believe criticizing the 
government and its policies 
should not be generalized to 
imply anti-Semitism, unless 
these criticisms specifically 
negatively target Judaism or 
Jews in general.
We should be quick to 
condemn anti-Semitism, as 

with all forms of religious 
discrimination, but we should 
not 
misconstrue 
political 
sentiments as anti-Semitism. 
Anti-Semitism is real and it 
exists on this campus, but 
when people equate political 
statements to a blind hatred 
toward Jews, they obstruct 
the possibility for nuanced 
conversation 
and 
joint 

productive action.
I don’t want the Jewish 
state to disappear, but I 
am also not offended by 
criticism of Israel; in fact, I 
welcome it. I’m not going to 
blindly support the Israeli 
government while it carries 
out 
severe 
human 
rights 
violations, and I’m not going 
to 
support 
Israel’s 
prime 
minister 
while 
he 
denies 
these acts.
Though 
politically 

conservative 
voices 

supporting Israel’s current 
policies are more prominent 
on campus, they should not 
be viewed as more legitimate 
than 
underrepresented 
voices. The Jewish student 
body does not speak with one 
unified voice – and that’s ok.
As a Jew who is hurt deeply 
by 
anti-Semitism, 
a 
rigid 
definition of anti-Semitism 
that broadly equates criticism 
of Israel with hatred toward 
Jews does not represent me. 
As I find myself caught in 
escalating campus tensions 
concerning Israeli politics, 
I feel a responsibility to 
critique Israel’s policies not 
in spite of my identity as a 
Jewish student, but because 
of it.

‘B’ team strong ahead of Big Ten Championships

As freshman Anne Forsythe lined 
up at the Hudson Mills Metropark 
course Friday in Dexter, Mich., 
she recalled all the ins and outs 
of the land in front of her. Having 
raced on the course multiple times 
throughout her high school career, 
the Ann Arbor native had plenty 
of experience to draw on — not to 
mention world-class talent.
In the end, these factors would 
combine to help Forsythe cross 
the finish line first at the EMU Fall 
Classic and faster than she’s ever 
done it before — almost 63 seconds 
faster to be exact. Forsythe would 
finish the race with a time of 16:57.9.
While not competing in a 
Michigan 
uniform, 
Forsythe 
supplemented a stellar Wolverine 
performance 
that 
saw 
both 
the men’s and women’s teams 
dominate.
Forsythe is a freshman at 
Michigan, but ran unaffiliated from 
the university as to not burn her 
redshirt status with the team. But 
after two dominant, unattached 

performances 
in 
the 
regular 
season, coach Mike McGuire has 
a tough decision make — maintain 
Forsythe’s redshirt status or find 
her a spot in an already stacked 
postseason squad.
“Obviously, it’s gonna be my 
decision, but we’re gonna get 
input on where she’s at,” McGuire 
said. “She hasn’t had the luxury of 
running in uniform up to this point, 
so there is a bit of an adjustment 
with all the sudden stepping in the 
lineup with your teammates, that 
kinda thing. We want to make sure 
it’s the right time for the team and 
the right time for Anne.”
If selected to compete at next 
week’s Big Ten Championships, 
Forsythe would try to help her team 
win its third straight Big Ten title 
amid one of the most competitive 
conferences in the country.
And 
the 
Wolverines 
look 
poised to do just that. Finishing 
second at last week’s Pre-National 
Invitational, only behind last year’s 
champion New Mexico, Michigan 
showed its depth and finished first 
among Big Ten foes.
On Friday, though, the focus was 

on the Wolverines’ ‘B’ team — a 
squad that also flexed its muscle in 
a top finish in Dexter. The women’s 
team claimed a dominant victory 
over the likes of Michigan State and 
Eastern Michigan.
Leading the pack for Michigan 
was 
fifth-year 
senior 
Rachel 
Coleman who clocked a 17:32.2 
on 
the 
five-kilometer 
course. 
She finished fifth overall in the 
event and was followed closely by 
redshirt junior Faith Reynolds, who 
finished sixth with a time of 17:38.4. 
Showing 
drastic 
improvement 
from just a season ago, redshirt 
freshman Raquel Powers finished 
seventh in 17:43.8.
“I’d say of our athletes in 
uniform, Rachel Coleman ran 
her best race of the season by far,” 
McGuire said, “And I thought we 
had some really solid performances 
from several others such as Faith 
Reynolds and Raquel Powers.”
As for the men’s race, the 
Wolverines landed another three 
runners in the top-10 to show the 
depth of its team while closing 
out the regular season. Redshirt 
freshman 
Christian 
Hubaker 

crossed the finish line fourth 
overall and first for Michigan with 
a time of 15:22.2.
A 
pair 
of 
fellow 
redshirt 
freshmen, 
Dominic 
Dimambro 
and Lewis Tate, quickly followed 
Hubaker to come in eighth and 
ninth with times of 15:33.3 and 
15:35.2, respectively.
The men’s team trotted out its ‘B’ 
squad as well on Friday, while both 
‘A’ teams rested up for the start of 
the postseason meets. With a week 
of rejuvenation under its belts, both 
the mens’ and women’s teams are 
poised for continued success ahead 
of the Big Ten Championships and 
are embracing the opportunity to 
take on the conference’s best.
“We know it’s gonna be a 
challenge,” McGuire said. “There 
are five teams ranked in the top 
15, so outside of the two real power 
conferences at this point in the 
nation are ourselves and the Pac-
12. Both meets will be barnburners 
in their own right. And we’re just 
excited to be a part of the mix. We’ll 
be prepared and hopefully set up 
a race plan to get us on top of the 
podium.”

Hailey Brown is back in action for Michigan

Last season, forward Hailey 
Brown 
joined 
the 
Michigan 
women’s basketball team as the 
most promising player of the 
group’s freshmen class. She was a 
five-star recruit, had experience 
with the Canadian National 
Team program and had started 
proving her talents early on for 
the Wolverines.
Brown earned her spot in 
the starting lineup for the first 
game and stayed put, averaging 
25 minutes, nine points and 5.2 
rebounds per game.
Brown 
hit 
full 
stride 
in 
January, shooting 50 percent 
or better from the field in six 
straight games. Against Indiana, 
on Jan. 10th, she converted 10-of-
12 from the field — including 
3-of-3 from beyond the arc — to 
finish with 23 points and eight 
rebounds. With that standout 

performance, she won both Big 
Ten and National Freshman of 
the Week honors.
“Really transitioned well into 
freshman year,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico at the 
team’s Oct. 10th Media Day, 
“and had a really, really solid 
freshman year.”
But 
after 
starting 
27 
consecutive 
games, 
Brown’s 
season took a turn in February. 
During the Wolverines’ game at 
Michigan State, Brown came off 
the court with a lower left leg 
injury near the end of the fourth 
quarter.
Her recovery took time. When 
Michigan headed for the NCAA 
Tournament, Brown could have 
played but rested instead, so not 
to risk further injury. Though her 
absence on the court burdened 
the team, it was not a total loss 
for Brown. Rather, she gained 
insights from the change of 
perspective.

“I feel like by me being out I 
see the game differently — how 
I can affect what our team does,” 
Brown said after practice on 
Oct. 22. “So, I feel like I have a 
stronger understanding of what 
my role is.”
During 
the 
tournament, 
Brown took note of what the 
team was missing and discussed 
her observations with Barnes 
Arico.
“We were both on the same 
page for things,” Brown said. 
“Now, it’s great to be back on 
the court and applying what I 
learned from that.”
Around early April, Brown 
finally started playing again. To 
ease her way back into shape, 
she focused her time on both 
anti-gravity 
and 
underwater 
treadmills. 
As 
she 
gained 
strength, 
she 
progressed 
to 
running.
Brown hopes to be a key 
contributor on offense this season. 

Over the summer, she emphasized 
pull-up jump shots and drives to 
the rim in her practice regime. 
She also wishes to build on and 
maintain the shooting success she 
established midway through her 
freshman year.
Without Katelynn Flaherty — 
the program’s all-time leading 
scorer, who graduated after 
last season — Brown’s ability 
to score could be vital to her 
team. But Jillian Dunston, who 
averaged nine rebounds per 
contest, is gone too. Thus, Brown 
knows she’ll need to play a more 
prominent role under the glass.
“Rebounding 
is 
a 
huge 
emphasis,” Brown said. “ … 
Definitely I’m gonna have to step 
up and rebound as much as I can 
and put that effort out there.”
And with the season around 
the corner, Barnes Arico is 
excited to have her back.
“She is back,” Barnes Arico 
said, “and she is better than ever.”

Sophomore forward Hailey Brown figures to be a key part of Michigan’s efforts to replace players like Katelynn Flaherty and Jillian Dunston, who both graduated.

For ‘M,’ every weakness 
is a learning experience

Just days after the No. 12 
Michigan hockey team’s 5-4 
loss 
to 
Western 
Michigan, 
coach Mel Pearson harped 
on a troubling trend for the 
Wolverines.
On Saturday night against 
the Broncos, Michigan was 
plagued with a bad case of 
turnovers, especially in the 
defensive zone — three of 
which resulted in Western 
Michigan goals. For a team 
that, at times, looks like it can 
score at will, Michigan didn’t 
do its defense and freshman 
goaltender Strauss Mann any 
favors.
Pearson, though, has three 
different remedies ready for 
his 
players 
come 
practice 
time to iron out wrinkles like 
turnovers. The first one is just 
approaching players one-on-
one, and making sure they 
know their mistakes, quick and 
direct.
“It’s a game of mistakes,” 
Pearson said. “You have to 
understand where you are on 
the ice, the situations on the 
ice, and those turnovers were 
all in bad spots. So we have to 
continue to work on that.”
If that doesn’t work, or 
if Pearson senses the team 
could benefit from looking 
at a player’s mistake, he isn’t 
afraid to show the mishap on 
tape in front of the whole team. 
Pearson breaks down the errors 
to his players, educating the 
entire team on how to improve.
“We don’t want to embarrass 
anybody, but the video doesn’t 
lie,” Pearson said. “It’s right 
there.”
Once the issue is sniffed 
out, Pearson and Michigan fix 
those mistakes by playing them 
out exactly as they happened 
on the ice. With the turnovers 

specifically, the team practiced 
more full-ice situational drills, 
which 
emphasize 
decision-
making with the puck.
On Michigan’s first turnover 
that led to a Broncos goal, the 
Western 
Michigan 
defense 
cornered 
Michigan’s 
wings. 
Rather than quickly clearing 
the puck, Michigan waited for 
the support that never came. 
Naturally, the Broncos stole the 
puck, forced an odd-man rush 
and flicked in the first goal.
“It’s situational,” said junior 
forward Jake Slaker. “I think 
when we do breakouts out of 
the zone, a lot of our turnovers 
are 
in 
the 
danger 
areas, 
whether that’s the blue line in 
the offensive zone or the blue 
line in the defensive zone.”
Whether it’s a freshman 
coughing up the puck or junior 
forward Will Lockwood — 
whose game on Saturday was 
only his third in almost a year 
after a season-ending shoulder 
injury — going through the 
motions of how to better a 
certain facet of the game helps 
to fix novice or rust-induced 
mistakes.
“A lot of our daily drills 
are predicated on in-game 
situations, so we always show 
them how to do it and why we 
do it,” Pearson said. “Practice 
is practice, but when you get in 
games, the speed is different, 
the situation is different.”
While mistakes are evident 
in the Wolverines’ play — 
resulting in a 1-2 record to 
start the season — Pearson is 
confident these problems can 
be mended.
“The beauty of that is that 
it’s fixable,” Pearson said. “I’ve 
been around a long time, and 
some things you see and just 
go, ‘Wow, we’re just not going 
to be able to fix that, but other 
things like this you can fix.’ A 
bad read or a bad play.”

Michigan players using different methods to improve mental strength

Assistant 
coach 
DeAndre 
Haynes preaches the importance 
of having a short-term memory 
on the court. When Isaiah 
Livers first heard the advice, 
the sophomore forward found 
it so striking, he wrote it on 
his shoe. That way, every time 
Livers looked down, he would 
remember to forget, developing 
an aspect of his game that was 
largely absent last year.
In basketball, the ability to 
block out noise and remain 
calm amid distractions is a vital 
and underrated aspect of the 
game — a skill many players 
don’t develop until later in their 
careers. But in the offseason, 
when 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball team’s practice time 
is limited, many players worked 
on their mental games — and 
they’re beginning to see it pay 
off.
Livers didn’t stop at his shoes. 
He spent a lot of time reading 
books by his idol Bruce Lee.
“I learned more about, life is 
gonna happen, you just gotta let 
it,” Livers said. “ … That sticks 
with me every day now. Even 
before practice, I think about it, 
like if you’re gonna miss a shot, 
you were supposed to miss a 
shot because it’s what fate had 
for you, so I kinda don’t try to 
control everything as much as I 
did.”
Livers 
didn’t 
make 
a 
single 3-pointer in the NCAA 
Tournament. It’s a stat that still 
sticks with him — a byproduct 
of not having enough of a short-
term memory last year. A jump 
shot is all about fluidity and 
muscle memory, and because of 
that, being slightly off mentally 
can have a big impact physically. 
It’s a lesson Livers now wishes 
he could have used in every 
game of the postseason.
That’s why the coaches have 
also 
been 
emphasizing 
the 
psychological 
aspect 
of 
the 
sport. Michigan coach John 

Beilein has brought in a person 
to 
run 
guided 
meditation 
sessions and help players with 
the mental side of free-throw 
shooting. Sometimes, it works 
almost too well.
“We’ve 
been 
doing a lot of 
meditation,” 
Haynes 
said. 
“(Beilein) 
brought in a guy 
the 
other 
day, 
and we all was in 
the media room, 
and he actually 
put 
a 
lot 
of 
people to sleep. 
He just taught us 
to relax.”
And while meditation can 
seem soporific to some, many 
players 
have 
discovered 
its 
benefits — and credit it with 
improving their mental game on 
and off the court.

“It’s done a lot,” said junior 
guard Zavier Simpson. “At first, 
I’m not gonna say I wasn’t a fan 
of it, I just didn’t do it. As I began 
to mature, so I would probably 
say beginning of last year, I 
started doing a 
lot of meditation 
amongst myself 
and just trying 
to read certain 
books 
that 
dealing 
with 
mental 
health, 
just 
trying 
to 
make 
life 
and 
basketball 
and 
everything 
around me a lot 
easier.”
Simpson keeps his specific 
meditation practices to himself, 
but he’s also happy to give his 
teammates advice if they ask. 
After all, as one of the team’s 
veterans — and one who has 

faced his fair share of adversity 
— he has a lot to offer to younger 
players beyond his on-court 
presence.
He frequently tells teammates 
to find little segments of time to 
relax and take 
their minds away 
from everything 
else going on — 
even if it’s just 
a few minutes 
per night spent 
reading or doing 
meditation. 
Many 
of 
the 
underclassmen 
are 
now 
discovering how 
much of a difference it can make.
“I’ve been doing a lot of 
yoga 
and 
meditation,” 
said 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole. 
“More relax time. I’m saying 
I used to just want to hurry up 
and leave and go somewhere last 

year.”
Poole went beyond just taking 
time to relax. After a brush with 
celebrity following his buzzer-
beating March Madness shot 
against Houston, Poole wanted 
to 
learn 
more 
about 
himself. 
He deleted most 
social 
media. 
He 
went 
to 
pumpkin farms. 
He watched real 
estate-themed 
TV shows with 
his parents. And 
most of all, he 
took the time to 
learn new things 
and discover everything the 
world had to offer.
Last year, Poole was always 
moving. Now he knows the 
importance of slowing down.
“(I learned) to be extremely 
composed, not get overwhelmed 

with things because when so 
much is getting thrown at you, 
you can start to … freak out a lot 
and and start moving too fast 
and not go back to the basics,” 
Poole said. “But when things 
are being thrown at you, and 
you’re able to just relax and in 
the moment and calm down and 
take things slowly, I feel like it 
helps on the court and off the 
court.”
The mental side of the game 
is 
something 
players 
often 
learn from each other, and for 
no teammates is that more true 
than Poole and Livers. Over 
the summer, the two hung out 
constantly, 
swapping 
video 
games, TV shows and books. 
Even subconsciously, the best 
aspects of Poole’s effervescent 
personality and Livers’ mellower 
one influenced the other.
“I 
noticed 
(Poole) 
was 
changing 
and 
getting 
more 
mature. He used to be late to 
everything. Now he’s more on 
time,” Livers said. “No matter 
what it was, he was late, so I was 
like, ‘Dang!’ I think he’s more, I 
think I rubbed off more on him.
“ … That swag and that chip 
on his shoulder rubbed off on me 
a lot because the offseason I was 
working on my mental game and 
just hearing his positivity every 
day helped me a lot.”
In theory, the changes are 
simple. But in a sport where 
the right frame of mind can 
be the difference between a 
flood of shots and a scoring 
drought, those changes can be 
monumental. And while every 
player has a different method 
of developing confidence and 
ignoring distractions, everyone 
has started to see the value in it.
“Just 
finding 
peace 
and 
blocking out all the noise,” said 
junior center Jon Teske. “ … I 
think that’s a big part of the 
game too.
“ … I kinda just, kinda clear 
my mind. I love naps, so I kinda 
just take a nap.”
As long as they’re not during 
meditation sessions.

Jake Slaker helping Wolverines’ top line of Josh Norris and Will Lockwood 

You saw a taste of it Friday 
night against No. 19 Western 
Michigan.
Jake Slaker, Josh Norris and 
Will Lockwood made things 
happen.
However, 
in 
the 
opening 
game of the season, the No. 11 
Michigan hockey team’s top 
line had a slightly different 
look. Instead of junior forward 
Slaker, Michigan head coach 
Mel Pearson chose to go with 
sophomore 
forward 
Michael 
Pastujov in his stead, opting for 
a moderately bigger and more 
physical option in the crafty, 
speedy line.
And though the line produced 
a goal, a change was needed 
after a 5-2 loss against Vermont 
in the opener.
And that change was Slaker.
Slaker had been the heir 
apparent for the first line after 
the previous year’s top line — 
the Dancs, Marody, Calderone 
line — had departed. Of the 
returning players, Slaker had the 
second most points and the most 
goals at 27 and 15, respectively. 
And more importantly, he did 
it with Norris as a linemate. So 
it was a surprise to many when 
he was put on the third line 
instead.
But upon being promoted 
to 
the 
first 
line, 
Slaker’s 
performance has justified the 
decision.
Since his entry into the line, 
the 
top-line 
forwards 
have 
produced three goals and two 
assists.
“Last year, Slaker played with 
Norris pretty well the whole 
year. I just showed Josh the 
line chart today from last year 
when we played in the regional,” 
Pearson said. “We had Slaker 
and Warren and Norris together. 
So Josh and Jake played well 
together and we feel there’s 
some chemistry between Will 
and Josh right now. And you’re 
trying to find that chemistry.”
Chemistry 
is 
essential 
for success in any sport, but 
especially hockey. As Slaker 
noted — the game is so fast that 

sometimes the players don’t 
even have a chance to look and 
see where their linemates are.
“Sometimes, you don’t really 
have a chance to look,” Slaker 
said. “You kinda just know 
where the guy is or you kinda 
sense where the guy is and I 
think that just comes with time 
and situations and we’ve only 
played 
two 
games 
together 
this year and now we’ve got 
Lockwood, a new linemate, 
so I think once we play a little 
longer together, it’ll really add 
the chemistry.”
In Friday’s matchup against 
Western, 
Norris 
initiated 
an offensive attack midway 
through the second period. 
Slipping through the defense, he 
drew the defenders and brought 

the puck to Joseph Cecconi, who 
in turn passed to Lockwood. Set 
in front of the net, Lockwood 
scored 
Michigan’s 
second-
power play goal of the game. 
“They’re 
all 
good 
players,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“They 
all 
can 
skate, They all 
can score. They 
all 
can 
create 
offense.”
And 
the 
offensive 
push 
continued 
minutes 
later, 
this time with 
Slaker.
“It was a power play goal,” 
Slaker said. “Quinn made a nice 
pass to Josh, and Josh likes to 

take that one tee on that side, 
and it’s one of those things 
where usually the net front guy 
falls off back door just to be 
an option. If he does miss the 
netter or if he 
does 
rebound, 
then I’m right 
there.”
Having 
fought 
for 
position, Slaker 
capitalized after 
a 
hard 
battle 
for the front of 
the net. Earlier 
in 
the 
week 
during practice, 
Norris had approached Slaker 
to talk about what to do in that 
situation. It was a chemistry-
building moment that can only 

strengthen a line. So during the 
talk, Norris suggested to Slaker 
to fall off and put his stick 
towards the net.
“Honestly, I didn’t even see 
the puck,” Slaker said. “It came 
so fast, I just had my stick and 
placed it and I felt it go off.
“I was just pretty excited. Just 
one of those situations where 
you kinda get the ball rolling for 
the season, and happy it came 
then because it turned out to be 
a pretty big goal as it came down 
to a 6-5 game.”
And it wasn’t just Slaker who 
had the ball rolling. The three 
linemates and their chemistry 
displayed potential throughout 
the weekend that had Pearson 
seeing flashes of last season.
“We saw some good things,” 

Pearson 
said. 
“We’ve 
seen 
Norris score, we saw Slaker 
score, we saw Lockwood score 
this weekend so that’s good. 
We think that can be a really 
dominate line, not unlike the run 
‘DMC’ line we had last year, with 
Dancs, Marody and Calderone. 
We see that they can play against 
anyone else’s top line.”
The 
difference 
between 
Pastujov 
and 
Slaker’s 
top 
line impact is style. Whereas 
Pastujov has a little bit more 
physical style of play, Slaker 
complemented 
his 
linemates 
with his speed, puck control and 
puck movement.
“I think once we get our 
chemistry going, we can really 
get something special going,” 
Slaker said.

What democracy looks like: The 
intersection of art and activism

When politics are brought up, it 

invokes a series of reactions. Some 
may jump at the term, desperate 
for any chance to share their bona 
fide beliefs. Others will recoil, 
either because of their discomfort 
in 
disclosing 
their 
political 

dispositions 
or 
embarrassment 

at their ignorance of the topic. 
Politics can ruin friendships, first 
dates and Thanksgiving dinners — 
particularly now, at a time during 
which one’s politics has seemingly 
become the defining pillar of their 
character. In this polarized state 
that too often turns ugly, it may 
seem ridiculous to try and find any 
beauty in the chaos.

Yet, that it is exactly what many 

have set out to do. To people of 
all ages and backgrounds, the 
tumultuous country they have 
found themselves living in is not 
one where they feel defeated, 
but rather compelled to fight on. 
With every shocking decision and 
revolting remark, there is a new 
protest, a new fundraiser, a new 
movement looking to help anyone 
that may need it. In the darkness 
of prejudice and intolerance comes 
the fire of activism, and there is 
no better way to express such 
passion than through the universal 
medium of art.

The 
Center 
for 
Artistic 

Activism, based in New York City, 
defines artistic activism as “a 
dynamic practice combining the 
creative power of the arts to move 
us emotionally with the strategic 
planning of activism necessary to 
bring about social change.” Simply 
put, this form of art is meant to 
make the viewer feel something 
powerful; to make them want to 
promote change. In 2014, during a 
seemingly unending string of mass 
shootings, artist Michael Murphy 
created an installation of toy guns 
shaped as the the United States. 
During the Women’s March, news 
sources hung onto pictures of hand-
woven pussy hats and personally 
made signs. These images provoked 
thought, hope and a desire to make 
the future different.

Amplifier is a design lab based 

in Seattle. Its specialty is activist 
art and its mission is to “flip artists 
into activists, and observers into 
participants,” according to its 
website. While you may not have 
heard of Amplifier, you have 
definitely seen the work of its 
artists. The now-iconic image of a 
woman wearing an American flag 
hijab was a part of Amplifier’s “We 
The People” campaign, which its 
website describes as “a nonpartisan 
campaign dedicated to igniting a 
national dialogue about American 
identity and values through public 
art and story sharing.”

In an email interview with The 

Daily, Deputy Director of Amplifier, 
Cleo Barnett explained the “We 
The Future” campaign as a way of 
“moving energy and ideas from our 
streets into our classrooms.”

Following 
the 
success 
and 

impact of “We The People,” 
Amplifier has moved on to a new 
project: supplementing education 
with art. The organization’s latest 
campaign, titled “We The Future,” 
looks 
to 
replace 
traditional 

classroom posters and resources 
with ones made by more diverse 
and 
activist-minded 
artists. 

Young leaders from various social 
movements including gun control, 
climate protection, immigration 
and 
voting 
rights 
are 
being 

represented through art and stories 

to inspire the next generation of 
activists. The hope is that by seeing 
activists that more closely align 
with themselves, rather than old, 
white presidents or an outdated 
propaganda poster, students will 
in turn feel an internalized need to 
participate.

Barnett 
reiterated 
the 

goals of Amplifier as a way to 
ignite creativity and promote 
representation. 

“Our goal is to reclaim and 

rebuild an American identity rooted 
in equality, dignity, diversity, truth 
and beauty,” Barnett wrote, “For 
young people who are not used to 
seeing themselves in history books 
or on the walls of classrooms, what 
Amplifier and its partners are 
distributing is more than art.”

Bayeté 
Ross 
Smith 
is 
a 

multimedia 
artist, 
filmmaker 

and educator who has previously 
done work with Amplifier. As a 
photographer, his work often falls 
under the category of turning 
observers into participants.

“Far too often people will take 

a very surface approach to (social 
issues) and won’t dig deeper,” he 
said in a phone interview with The 
Daily. “That often means that we’re 
not getting involved in constructive 
and productive exchanges of ideas. 
… You see the work I do and you 
have a certain reaction to it, my 
hope is one will question why they 
had that reaction, the validity of 
that reaction and why their reaction 
was different from someone else’s.”

When it comes to viewing 

art, the way one receives and is 
impacted by a piece comes down to 
perspective.

“I 
think 
one’s 
personal 

foundation is always the foundation 
for the lense through which they 
see the world,” Smith said. “If we 
were all sitting in the same room 
and we were to photograph it, all 
of our photographs would look a bit 
different. They’ll all technically be 
truthful, but they’ll still be vastly 
different. You can see the same 
thing from different perspectives 
and see various forms of truth, it’s 
just important to be aware of how 
our perspectives impact us.”

Using art as a form of activism 

is not an exclusively contemporary 
concept. For decades, the voices of 
the oppressed are most strongly 
shown in the literature and 
artwork they create. This creativity 
has filtered through generations, 
impacting the modernized form 
of various historical movements 
and weaving itself into the public 
sphere. A controversial example 
of this is Beyoncé’s use of the style 
of the Black Panther Party in her 
2017 Super Bowl Halftime show to 
support to the Black Lives Matter 
movement and the issues facing 
the Black community. Much of the 
Black Panther Party’s image and 
protest was projected in its style, 

as it challenged conventional looks 
of the time. Their daring artistry 
has stood the test of time, as has 
the legacy of a magnitude of social 
movements from American history. 

On the special collections floor 

of the Hatcher Graduate Library, 
the Labadie Collection is housed 
in hidden stacks. An anthology 
of pamphlets, posters, buttons, 
newspapers and other materials 
from activist movements dating 
back to the early 20th century, 
the collection has been a part of 
University archives since 1911. It 
was donated by Joseph Labadie, a 
Mich. native who was active in the 
anarchist and labor movements of 
the late 1800s.

Julie Herrada has been the 

curator of the Labadie Collection 
since 2000. Before that, she was 
assistant curator for six years. 
She says while the collection still 
gathers modern anarchist and 
labor literature, it has grown into 
a selection of a variety of activist 
materials from around the United 
States and the world.

“The original donation from 

Joseph Labadie was early-19th-
century 
materials 
on 
labor 

movements, socialist and anarchist 
movements, then with each curator 
it grew in size to include those 
contemporary movements of the 
day,” Herrada said in an interview 
with The Daily. “Whatever was 
happening within the time period 
of the curator, they could start 
collecting that and adding so the 
collection included all forms of 
social protest and all countries, so it 
has an international scope as well.”

The existence of the Labadie 

Collection, and particularly its 
earlier pieces, makes for a vital 
comparison of activist art from 
over a century ago to an image 
created today. While the anarchist 
and labor movements that started 
the collection may now seem 
dormant, that does not diminish its 
importance.

“I think it’s important for people 

who are in college now to know 
that these the movements had 
relevance and were important in 
their time and how people spread 
the word about those messages,” 
Herrada explained. “You can look 
at something online and you will 
really not get the same feeling 
about it as if you’re holding it in 
your hands. Maybe hundreds of 
people held it in their hands and 
maybe the first person who held it 
in their hands was the person who 
created it. It gives you a sense of 
excitement about connecting to the 
past.”

Connections to the past are 

exactly what viewers of the Labadie 
Collection are looking for. Herrada 
said the collection is often visited 
by classes at the University — three 
had observed the pieces just on the 
one day we held our interview — 

and students and professors alike 
generally have the same response.

“When they are reading some of 

the documents from 50 years ago 
they see how relevant the content 
is to today,” Herrada noted. “It’s 
something that could’ve been 
written yesterday, as opposed to 
50 years ago, and I always see them 
kind of surprised by that. We’ve 
come so far in our society but yet 
we are still arguing about these 
same things.”

Whether it is the advancement 

of labor rights, the recognition 
of 
transgender 
individuals 
or 

the continuation of the fight for 
civil rights, the United States has 
experienced 
expansive 
social 

crusades for centuries. Though 
the outright goal of these activists 
may differ, their core values remain 
the same throughout movements. 
Be it laborers campaigning for fair 
treatment and working conditions 
or 
the 
LGBT 
community 

demanding basic human rights, 
activism grows out of admitting 
something is wrong and unjust and 
demanding to live your life — while 
inspiring others to do the same — in 
any way that can make a difference. 
 

So many people brush aside 

social issues because they have 
heard about it but don’t know 
enough or they think someone 
else is taking care of it. Art has the 
power to change this indifference. 
It 
transcends 
language 
and 

backgrounds 
to 
reach 
people 

in a way that transforms the 
problem into something tangible, 
something that applies to them. 
Unlike speeches, news reports and 
monotonous facts, art conjures 
emotions 
and 
thoughtfulness. 

As Smith said, “You now feel in 
your heart that responding to this 
event or occurrence or dynamic 
in the world is an important and 
relevant part of your daily life. 
Art takes things that we may be 
able to intellectualize, and makes 
them actively relevant to our daily 
experiences in a provocative and 
compelling way.”

According to Amplifier’s Deputy 

Director, Cleo Barnett, “Art is 
more than beauty or decoration: It 
is a weapon and a shield. Art has 
the power to wake people up and 
serve as a catalyst for real change. 
It is a megaphone for important 
but unheard voices that need 
amplifying. It is a bridge that can 
unite movements with shared 
values in ways other mediums 
cannot. Art gives us symbols to 
gather around, builds community, 
and helps us feel like we are not 
alone.”

If I hear ‘America 
First’ in a movie 
again, I will die

The 
next 
time 
someone 

quotes Donald Trump in a 
movie and tries to pass it off as 
political satire, I am going to 
spontaneously combust in the 
theater.

It’s a feeling that began 

festering 
inside 
me 
this 

summer when I watched “The 
First Purge” and bore witness 
to a scene in which a man in a 
dollar store demon mask grabs 
a woman by her nether regions 
only to be fought off and declared 
a — ahem — “p*ssy-grabbing 
motherf*cker.” Since then, it’s 
only grown, and most recently 
it reached its climax with my 
viewing of “Venom,” which 
saw fit to include a scene where 
the villain dismisses reports 
of human experimentation as 
“fake news.”

“It’s going to happen,” I 

realized then. “My soul will 
detonate, and it will take my 
body with it.”

To be clear, these are not 

the words of an angry Trump 
supporter who can no longer 
bear the thought of those 
dastardly Hollywood liberals 
besmirching the good name of 
the Donald. Quite the opposite 
— I believe film and satire 
are art forms uniquely suited 
to 
tackle 
the 

problems posed 
by the current 
administration 
and 
galvanize 

the 
public 
in 

opposition 
to 
them. 
The 

problem 
now 

is 
we’re 
not 

satirizing 
Trump. 
We’re 

just sarcastically 
repeating 
what 

he says.

The 

foundation 
of 

satire is taking 
an ideology and 
turning it inside 
out, whether it’s 
“Cabin in the Woods” turning 
horror tropes into a workplace 
comedy or “The Death of Stalin” 
turning the murderous power-
jockeying of post-Stalin Soviet 
politics into a Monty Python-
esque farce. Whatever the case, 
there’s an idea that’s being 
engaged with and subverted.

The 
problem 
is 
we’ve 

been foregoing this analysis 
in favor of simply quoting 
Trump and leaving it at that, 
shifting the focus away from 
where 
it 
should 
be 
both 

politically 
and 
satirically: 

his actions. Trump could be 
a thespian of Shakespearean 
wit and vocabulary, and if he 
still 
dehumanizes 
everyone 

who isn’t a straight, white, 
American-born man with his 
every action, he would remain 
the worst president we’ve had 
this side of World War II. We 
should be able to take stock 
of what he’s done and build a 
movie around something.

Yet for whatever reason, 

Hollywood seems reluctant to 
move away from mere quotes 
in favor of something more 
substantial and lasting. Instead, 
we get Alec Baldwin’s gaudy, 
inexplicably 
Emmy 
Award-

winning Trump caricature. We 
get “The First Purge” dressing 
half its cast like Nazis with 
a leather fetish. We get the 
aforementioned “fake news” 
line 
in 
“Venom” 
and 
any 

number of other films like it. 
This doesn’t mean any movie, in 
order to make a statement, has 
to be straight political jargon, 
either. Just look at “Star Wars.”

Die-hard saga fans and film 

history buffs will probably 
know 
that 
the 
original 

trilogy is a critique of Nixon-
era 
politics, 
particularly 

regarding the Vietnam War, 
in which the technologically 
advanced Empire stood in for 
America and the underdog 
Rebellion took cues from the 
Viet Cong. Those weren’t the 

only influences — Lucas took 
inspiration 
from 
everything 

from World War II dogfights 
to western serials to Japanese 
cinema — but through it all, 
the framework was kept the 
same: a hostile, technologically 
advanced, 
imperialist 
force 

tries and fails to overcome a 
much smaller opposition.

Those 
political 
musings 

continued into the prequels, 
with Lucas aiming to tell a 
story of how democracies can 
be supplanted from within. 
By the time “Revenge of the 
Sith” rolled around in 2005, 
he had updated his real-world 
targets to include Dick Cheney 
and George W. Bush. Even 
the sequels, which began as a 
what-if scenario on the idea of 
Nazis regrouping in Argentina, 
evolved into a commentary 
on the entitlement and fragile 
identity politics at the core of 
the alt-right as time went on 
and the movement entered the 
mainstream.

Popular entertainment and 

political analysis don’t need to 
be kept separate. They just need 
to be smart about it. As with the 
Force, there has to be a balance. 
If Luke had walked into the 
throne room in “Return of 
the Jedi” and the Emperor 
had started belting out Nixon 
quotes, 
something 
magical 

would have been lost. Likewise, 

if 
Lucas 

hadn’t been so 
passionate about 
communicating 
his 
political 

beliefs 
to 
the 

masses, 
“Star 

Wars” may not 
have 
gotten 

made, and the 
landscape 
of 

cinema 
as 
we 

know it would 
be 
a 
different 

— and, I would 
argue, worse — 
place.

On the other 

hand, if a film 
wants 
to 
be 

through-and-

through political, it has its own 
tightrope to walk: It has to toe 
the line between resembling 
a cultural moment enough 
to be relevant and distanced 
enough from that moment to 
continue to be relevant years 
and even decades down the 
road. 
“BlacKkKlansman” 

comes as close as any film I’ve 
seen 
to 
satirizing 
Trump-

era politics as it presents and 
combats an ideology, but it then 
makes the mistake of explicitly 
tying itself to Trump. Instead 
of being about the continual 
reoccurrence of white hate, 
it becomes about one specific 
reoccurrence. It will be all too 
easy for future generations of 
nationalists to pass over it once 
the age of Trump has ended: 
“That’s not about us. It’s about 
Trump, see?”

Compare 
that 
to 
“Wag 

the Dog,” which follows a 
Washington spin doctor and a 
Hollywood producer as they 
construct a fake war to distract 
from a presidential sex scandal. 
The film is based on a book that 
acted as a critique of Desert 
Storm, but it was released on 
Dec. 17, 1997, exactly one month 
before the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal broke and about nine 
months before Clinton was 
accused of bombing suspected 
al-Qaeda bases to distract from 
said scandal. The film was 
famously brought up then, but 
in the age of “Look over there!” 
politics, “Wag the Dog” has 
stayed relevant, its message 
adaptable to multiple political 
climates but never less than 
incisive.

That’s what we should be 

striving for: Films that can 
combat Trump, that can show 
people who may not otherwise 
realize what he truly is, but 
which won’t lose their meaning 
the moment he leaves office. 
I’m not saying it’s going to be 
easy. But it will, I believe, be 
worth it.

FILM NOTEBOOK

‘It’s going to 
happen,’ I 

realized then. 
‘My soul will 
detonate, and 
it will take my 
body with it.’


For comedy writers and late-

night personalities, the Trump 
presidency seemed to come with a 
silver lining: It was an unexcavated 
gold mine of material. Unless the 
nuclear holocaust arrived faster 
than expected, his four-year term 
would 
be 
commemorated 
by 

hilarious 
impressions, 
quotable 

moments and general buffoonery.

The blissful avoidance of the 

ramifications of Trump’s election 
that 
marked 
the 
television 

immediately following Nov. 9, 2016 
was a clear indication that nothing 
had been learned from the election 
itself. The campaign was treated 
as a farce — thus the results were 
what we received. Now, there also 
seemed to be an underestimation 
of his ability to implement concrete 
change that could regress our 
country. The eagerness with which 
late-night personalities raced to 
joke again, in spite of the gravity of 
our situation, now reminds me in 
a lot of ways of the joyous, careless 
send-off marches that preceded 
World War I. Despite there being 
an understanding that the soldiers 
were entering into a war, no one 
truly knew the hell they were in for. 
People had survived wars before; as 
a country, we had endured terrible 
presidents.

We were gonna be fine. Right?
Just like the fate of the soldiers, 

two years later, common Americans 
still find ourselves fighting the war 
from the trenches with no clear end 

to the madness in sight. However, 
for those in television, life inside the 
trenches looks a bit different. A new 
renaissance of late-night television 
has dawned. A mere four years ago, 
“Saturday Night Live” was clinging 
onto the last strands of relevancy, 
and people were solely tuning into 
“Jimmy Kimmel Live” to see Mean 
Tweets. But in 2018, the world 
of late night has been completely 
overturned by the results of the 
2016 election. Network ratings 
are 
booming 
and 
late-night 

personalities are more relevant and 
influential than ever before.

In 
the 
beginning, 
it 
was 

therapeutic to laugh along and 
marvel at the seemingly golden 
age of comedy into which we had 
entered, but two years down the 
line, my laugh lines have begun to 
show. As I watch the continuous 
attacks on marginalized groups and 
the appointment of more officials 
armed with the ability to strip away 
human rights, simply laughing 
along feels almost hollow.

I had to ponder why.
Despite the variances for each 

late-night program — from Jimmy 
Fallon’s 
choreographed, 
tepid 

shots at Trump to Seth Meyers’s 
more analytical dissection of his 
ineptitude 
to 
Samantha 
Bee’s 

outright, overt assault on the 
Trump administration — when 
you distill it down, everyone seems 
to be saying the same thing. These 
identical takes become even more 
troubling when you realize that 
despite feeling like we’re “sticking it 
to the man” by laughing, in reality, 
nothing is being done. Two years 
later, I have come to wonder what 

even is the point anymore?

In regards to news satires like 

“The Daily Show” or “Full Frontal 
with Samantha Bee,” the argument 
could be made that these programs’ 
“point” is to educate. Through 
laughter, we learn. I will not refute 
this point, as I can attest to the fact 
that I have learned plenty of useful 
information from these programs. 
However, this positive effect hinges 
on the simple question of who is 
watching — or rather, who wants to 
watch. While our country is more 
polarized than ever in terms of 
liberal versus conservative, there 
still remains a large sector of the 
population that considers itself to 
be moderate.

As a leftist Black feminist, I 

sought out programs like “The 
Daily Show” or “Full Frontal with 
Samantha Bee.” Frankly, moderates 
who are too apathetic to even 
definitively pick a side are not going 
to seek out these shows because 
of the very fact that they are, well, 
apathetic. Thus, the information 
that 
could 
be 
considered 

educational for those who do not 
know it already, or do not know that 
they should care about it is being 
presented to the liberals who have 
already bought the product the 
writers and personalities are selling. 
These programs’ “niche-ness” is a 
double-edged sword: While being 
able to take a more hardlined stance 
against the Trump administration, 
they are too niche to reach the 
audience that would make them 
effective. They’re screaming into 
the void.

On the other hand, network 

late-night shows face the opposite 
affliction. 
Nightly 
late-night 

variety shows often fly under 
the radar of critique because, 
traditionally, their purpose has 
been to entertain. Although now 
the opening monologues more 
often swing politically, there are 
still wacky sidekicks, funny bits 
and celebrity guests. Because of this 
“entertainment” appeal, the major 
networks of ABC, NBC and CBS 
still reach the broadest audience 
and report the highest ratings.

Unlike the more niche cable 

programming, a vast array of 
people are watching. However, 
because of this very fact, they 
must take a “safer” stance on 
divisive issues. With this in mind, 
it should come as no surprise that 

Seth Meyers, a more open critic 
of 
President 
Trump, 
receives 

lower ratings than Jimmy Fallon, 
who keeps his show as neutral as 
possible but will sometimes bend 
to pressure and half-heartedly 
mock 45. This presents a chicken-
and-egg conundrum: Are these 
shows highest rated because they 
are apolitical? Or rather, are they 
apolitical because they have the 
highest ratings? Either way you 
slice it, it’s the same issue; people are 
missing out on the opportunity to 
hear the better, analytical critique 
of the administration.

As much as it hurts me as a TV 

buff to admit it, our salvation from 
this administration will not be 
delivered solely through television 
personalities and witty monologue 
one-liners. 
Despite 
Trump’s 

obsession with what is occurring 
in the media, in reality, comedians 
are doing no more than just getting 
under his skin. Although this is a 
noble feat (who wouldn’t want to 
piss the guy off?), it is no substitute 
for real, substantiated change.

While I am not suggesting a 

temporary hold on all comedy 
until the regime is ousted, I am 
suggesting that we do not rely on 
sharing funny clips of Colbert on 
Facebook to like-minded friends 
as our only form of objection to 
the policies and acts of our current 
executive branch. It will not be 
and has never been enough to 
merely laugh along while the world 
crumbles, because before you know 
it, the laughter will subside and 
you’ll discover a world you no longer 
recognize.

A sense of rebellion is woven 

deeply into the American identity. 
While the last 250 years have 
proven that the people of the United 
States and their government have 
become experts at maintaining the 
status quo, there is still a part of our 
national identity that celebrates 
the notion that to be “American” 
is to react against something, 
sometimes against the institution of 
America itself. This was especially 
prevalent during the 20 years of 
the Vietnam War, a period during 
which political turmoil directly 
danced with massive cultural 
upheaval and rebirth. The center 
of this change rested squarely 
in the hands of varied social and 
political movements of the time, 
which leaned heavily on artistic 
expression and colored the Vietnam 
era with poignant commentary on 
its realities. In the face of death, 
confusion and the stagnant trudge 
of war, American counterculture 
paved a path through the muck by 
creating music that would last the 
test of time.

The political background of the 

Vietnam War was complicated 
and messy, the combination of 
a society entrenched in anti-
Communist rhetoric and the need 
to display American strength on an 
international scale. Lasting from 
1955 to 1975, the period during 

which Vietnam affected U.S. society 
spanned two decades and resulted 
in tens of thousands of American 
and Vietnamese casualties, leaving 
the nation at a loss for what the war 
truly meant in a historical context. 
To some, it was to establish stable 
democracy and eliminate Chinese 
influence in a new and warring 
nation. To others, the reason for 
conflict in Vietnam was obscure, 
a long-lasting fight that had no 
clear goal or end in sight. Though 
the older and more conservative 
generations maintained their belief 
in the war’s necessity, their voices 
were largely unrepresented in the 
artistic movements of the time. 
Country music artists like Merle 
Haggard remained supportive of 
the government throughout much 
of the war, but in comparison to 
the popularity of countercultural 
anthems, its pro-America messages 
were overshadowed.

Initially, the war gained support 

from a majority of Americans, but as 
time went on and deaths mounted, 
the national perspective began to 
shift toward ambivalence, while 
the massive population of nearly 80 
million young Baby Boomers kicked 
an anti-war effort into gear. The 
impetus of anguish for this youth 
movement was only exacerbated by 
the military draft, sending college 
campuses and urban centers across 
the country into action. With this 
action, the American tradition 
of rebellion was represented in 
their music, a medium by which 

communication 
was 
possible 

through the visceral power of song. 
These tunes would become the face 
of a generation and a period of time 
alike, framing the unrest of an era 
with songs heavy with soul and a 
timeless message of change against 
all odds. The spirit of freedom to 
fight for one’s beliefs continued in 
the hearts of musicians and fans 
alike during the Vietnam era, a 
protest for peace that continues to 
affect the country’s music today.

Before 
the 
Vietnam 
War’s 

influence truly reached American 
society, protest music was already 
in full force in response to the Civil 
Rights movement of the late ’50s 
and early ’60s. Artists like Joan 
Baez, Bob Dylan and Simon & 
Garfunkel stood at the forefront of 
the early folk music revival scene, 
which grew out of New York City’s 
Greenwich Village and into the 
ears of listeners across the country. 
Baez’s song “Birmingham Sunday,” 
among 
others, 
displayed 
the 

struggles of the battle for civil rights 
in America, while outstretching a 
hand for others to join the cause 
through the simplicity and bare-
bones style of folk music itself. 
The genre at its root was forged 
in the working man’s toils, so it 
was only natural for its sound to 
carry a message of empowerment 
and social awareness in a time of 
political uneasiness. When the 
war’s effects became more and 
more apparent in folk’s strongholds, 
the music began to reflect anti-

war sentiment and a painfully true 
commentary on the war’s effects on 
both soldiers and those still at home. 
From this, music like Dylan’s iconic 
song “Blowin’ in the Wind” was 
born, stamping a permanent mark 
in U.S. music history while fueling 
the debate around the war’s obtuse 
purpose and seemingly senseless 
violence. The message of folk 
music from that time was a clear 
analysis of what the international 
destruction of Vietnam meant in 
the context of already existing 
domestic 
turmoil, 
calling 
the 

listener to look deeper into the 
superficial peace of daily life to see 
a system in need of change.

While folk music colored much 

of the early ’60s protest songs, 
the anti-war message began to 
shift into rock and psychedelia as 
counterculture merged with many 
of the time’s youth movements. 
Protests 
erupted 
across 
the 

country in areas with high youth 
populations, only heightened by the 
massive scale of the Baby Boomer 
generation. 
Buffalo 
Springfield, 

then Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young 
and Creedence Clearwater Revival 
merged rock with the organic 
sound of folk, creating music with 
a direct and piercingly honest core. 
They highlighted the realities of 
government oppression in songs 
like “Ohio,” which commented on 
the Kent State Massacre of four 
student protesters in 1970, and 
“Fortunate Son,” a meditation on 
the inherent inequalities of the

war’s draft lottery system that 
became the unofficial anthem of 
the anti-war effort. The pop rock ‘n’ 
roll of the ’60s shifted into a darker, 
grittier version of itself in response 
to the political and social conflict 
of popular culture, with bands like 
The Beatles and the Rolling Stones 
moving into more experimental 
territory with albums such as 
Revolver and Let it Bleed. This edgier 
side to rock has stayed put since, 
becoming the standard for the genre 
as time has gone on.

But the image most have of 

the Vietnam era is of the hippie 
counterculture, 
of 
Woodstock 

’69 and Jimi Hendrix smashing 
guitars. This too was a response 
to the period’s social discord, as 
thousands of young, largely white 
and middle-class Americans joined 
the movement to embrace free 
love. They gathered at festivals 
like Monterey Pop to communally 
celebrate their music while joining 
hands against the negativity and 
confusion of wartime. The hippies 
were the face of that counterculture, 
especially in light of the drug 
culture that wove its way into their 
art and practices. They were not 
protesters, but rather purveyors of 
a peaceful mentality supported by 
pacifism and a kernel of ignorance. 
Psychedelic 
drugs 
like 
LSD 

influenced both the spiritual aspects 
and creative approach of the hippie 
movement, producing bands like 
Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful 
Dead’s whimsical sound. As the 
war reached its peak in the early 
’70s and devolved, so did the hippie 
counterculture and its popularity, 
leaving its style and music behind 
as many devotees descended into 
drug abuse or left the movement 
altogether. The “Summer of Love” 
in 1967 was arguably the climax of 
“free love” culture, a community 
assemblage that celebrated their 
customs and ideology. From there, 
hippie neighborhoods like San 
Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury district 
lost their glory quickly, leaving 
their music and aesthetic appeal as 
a lasting token of the movement’s 
ideals and highest achievements. 

While folk, rock and psychedelia 

created the sound of an era for 
white America, black soul and blues 
artists also continued their own 
path against the social tumult of the 
’60s and ’70s. Artists such as Marvin 
Gaye brought Motown and other 
R&B labels into the political sphere 
with records like 1971 release What’s 
Going On, the title track of which 
became a timeless representation of 
that era and others like it. “Father, 
father,” Gaye sings, “We don’t need 
to escalate / You see, war is not the 
answer / For only love can conquer 
hate.” These lyrics, among others 
from the period across every genre, 
show the universal application of 
protest and politically conscious 
art throughout time. “What’s Going 

On” could easily have been written 
today, or post-9/11, or during the 
HIV / AIDS epidemic in the ’90s. 
The political tenor of the Vietnam 
War’s music remains a large part 
of American pop music today, 
specifically in the darker, more 
direct themes seen in rock and 
folk music of the modern age. The 
generation that popularized this 
time’s most lasting music was huge, 
millions and millions of people born 
after WWII that brought the spirit 
of protest from their youth into the 
future and passed it along to their 
children. Overall, the themes of 
Vietnam era music are relevant in 
any time period, and a combination 
of poignant messages, truly great 
arrangement and the commitment 
of those who loved it to keep the 
melody in the public eye for decades.

It could be argued that the 

political turmoil of today’s Trump 
administration could offer the 
same fodder for musical and artistic 
development that the Vietnam 
War did, but the issue is slightly 
more complex. In the Vietnam 
era, the anti-war effort was easy 
to understand even if the purpose 
of the war wasn’t, and it gave the 
counterculture 
the 
opportunity 

to unite against a clear force. The 
Civil Rights Movement and Second-
Wave Feminism intermingled with 
this counterculture, but the goal of 
counterculture’s music was more 
crystalline than it is today. In 2018’s 
political climate, the issues with 
American government and society 
are 
increasingly 
complex 
and 

abstract. Activism has burst into the 
mainstream in response to this, and 
with it the message of “sticking it 
to the man” that much of Vietnam-
age music carried is almost not 
enough. The messages of that time 
have become commonplace in 
rock and folk, an expected edge to 
each genre that originated in the 
protests and festivals of the ’60s 
and ’70s. In its place, the protest 
music of today looks different, 
and elicits a different feeling than 
those songs: artists like Beyoncé, 
Childish Gambino and Kendrick 
Lamar have taken political action 
into rap and pop music, creating a 
new generation of activists that will 
hopefully continue the message just 
as those in the Vietnam era did. But 
the real question lies in whether 
the widespread political agendas 
of today’s musicians will become 
diluted in their commonality, or 
present a real chance to make 
change in America. If the effect of 
Vietnam’s music is any indication, 
connecting via art may hold the 
key to forming a community to flip 
the script of modern politics. But it 
is up to the listeners to take it into 
their own hands: Vietnam changed 
American music forever. Could the 
modern struggles of today’s political 
landscape change it for the better 
again?

Marc Evan Jackson only plays 

a demon on TV, or so he told me. 
The man behind the all-knowing 
judge of all matters in the afterlife 
is Marc Evan Jackson. Despite his 
role as the devil in charge Shawn 
on “The Good Place,” Mr. Jackson 
is anything but evil and, like me, a 
self-professed, incurable, devout 
improv nerd.

In a phone call with The 

Daily, Jackson described his first 
exposure 
to 
improvisational 

comedy as “life-opening.” He 
discovered improv by playing 
piano at rehearsal for River City 
Improv, a group formed by his 
former Calvin College classmates.

“I was there for 10 minutes,” 

Jackson explained, “and I was like, 
‘Oh man, we got to find someone 

else to play piano because I want to 
do what you’re doing for the rest of 
my life.’”

There was something about 

improv that drew him in. It was 
magnetic, it was energetic, it was 
everything he loved but he didn’t 
know it yet. He recalled about that 
first rehearsal: “They were the 
smartest, funniest, kindest, most 
empathetic people and I was like, 
‘Oh, I would like to be among you 
please be my friend.’”

After his initial introduction to 

the wonderful world of improv, 
Jackson went on to join The Second 
City in Detroit where he spent four 
years. Although his time in Detroit 
was short-lived, Jackson said that 
he was intoxicated by the city and 
that “Detroit became home far 
more than Buffalo ever was, or even 
more than Grand Rapids.” In 2001, 
he moved to Los Angeles where he 
joined a long-form improv group 

made up of former Detroit residents 
at Second City Hollywood called 
“The 313,” named after the area 
code of the city. The 313 still 
performs today and includes the 
likes of Tim Robinson and Sam 
Richardson (“Detroiters”), Keegan 
Michael-Key (“Key and Peele”), 
Larry Joe Campbell (“According 
to Jim”) and Maribeth Monroe 
(“Workaholics”).

Hanging out in Los Angeles 

with 
his 
cohort 
of 
Detroit 

expatriates, Jackson and his wife 
Beth 
Hagenlocker 
(co-founder 

and secretary at Detroit Creativity 
Project) wanted to know what they 
could do to help revitalize the city 
they loved.

“It became clear immediately,” 

Jackson said. “The thing that made 
us all good at what we do, made 
us all agreeable, nice, interested, 
interesting people and gave us 
careers is improvisation and the

I tried Trump’s TV diet 
and it almost killed me

Students from The Improv Project / COURTESY OF JACKSON

Donald Trump and I don’t 

seem to have much in common. 
He takes his steak well-done, I’m 
a lifelong vegetarian. His father 
hails from central Queens, mine 
from northeastern Queens. He is 
overseeing the dismantling of our 
democracy, I’m … you know, not. 
But one habit we share has been 
gnawing at me: Despite having 
better things to do, we’re both 
known to watch an obscene amount 
of television.

The consequences of my TV 

watching are — I’d like to think — 
pretty minimal (maybe a gratuitous 
“Seinfeld” 
reference 
here 
and 

there). But his is a different beast 
altogether. It’s now a defining 
feature of his presidency and shapes 
his politics in real, fascinating ways.

What could a medium I love 

teach me about a president I don’t? 
In a quest to better understand 
our 
enigmatic 
Commander-in-

Chief, I challenged myself to an 
experiment: a week of watching 
everything Trump watches on TV 
and nothing else.

Thanks 
to 
some 
shrewd 

reporting (and the president’s own 
tweets), we have a general sense of 
what Trump’s TV schedule looks 
like — it’s anywhere from four to 
eight hours per day, and heavy 
on morning shows (he watches 
about three hours of them before 
beginning his official workday at 
11:00 a.m.) and the Sunday political 
talk shows.

My 
weekdays 
began 
with 

the 6:00 a.m. hour of MSNBC’s 
“Morning Joe,” a show that decided 
what Americans would most like to 
watch first thing in the morning is 
a bunch of Beltway-types gloating 
about that Red Sox win last night. 
Guess again, Joe and Mika.

It’s followed by an hour or two 

of “Fox & Friends,” so notorious 
for its influence over the president 
that The New York Times TV 
critic James Poniewozik called 
it “the most powerful TV show 
in America.” When the Martian 
anthropologists descend on the 
wreckage of our climate-ravaged 
planet in 20 years, they should 

take a look at “Fox & Friends,” a 
beguiling cultural artifact that’s 
now the most-watched cable news 
morning show in America.

It 
operates 
so 
innocuously, 

with fluttering pop music and 
chipper hosts, that it’s easy to 
forget what the show really is: a 
daily Macy’s Thanksgiving Day 
Parade of conservative talking 
points, all served with a preening 
smile. “Hmm, Steve, seems like 
immigrants are going to kill us 
all, doesn’t it? Anyway, next up, 
Charlotte Pence is here to talk about 
her new book!” And despite their 
millions of viewers, the hosts are 
keenly aware they’re performing 
for an audience of one; a few times 
over the course of the week, Trump 
tweeted out headlines scrolling 
across the “Fox & Friends” chyron.

To their credit, the “Fox & 

Friends” gang was very much on top 
of the week’s biggest news story. No, 
not the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, 
but that Keira Knightley will not let 
her daughter watch “Cinderella.”

If Trump’s morning TV is 

designed to slowly rile him up, his 
evenings are designed to leave him 
seething and stewing. It’s a vicious 
lineup: “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” 
“Hannity” and “The Ingraham 
Angle.” Oh, how I long for those 
naïve days when I thought being 
subjected to an hour of “Hannity” 
was the worst thing that could 
befall me. The one thing worse than 
an hour of “Hannity,” I learned, 
is an hour of “Hannity” featuring 
special guest Rush Limbaugh, who 
joined us — oh joy — for the full hour 
Thursday night.

The big story the primetime 

shows were following this week 
was a caravan of Central American 
migrants headed for the southern 
border. Never mind that the caravan 
is at least a thousand miles from the 
U.S., Fox News covered it like CNN 
covering a hurricane: flustered 
reporters on the ground, ominous 
breaking news graphics, alarmist 
headlines ticking across the screen.

And it worked. On Thursday, 

with a prideful grin, Tucker Carlson 
played a clip of a Trump rally in 
Missoula, Montana. “Remember, 
it’s going to be an election of the 
caravan,” Trump said. “You know 
what I’m talking about.” At the same 

rally, he presented his slogan for the 
midterms: “Democrats produce 
mobs, Republicans produce jobs.” 
It was a clever line, if a familiar one: 
Jesse Watters had coined it earlier 
that afternoon on Fox News’s 5:00 
p.m. roundtable show, “The Five.”

A week of pandemonium ended 

tamely. A rerun of “SNL,” some 
empty punditry on Sunday’s “Meet 
the Press.” And finally, a low-key 
“60 Minutes,” which featured 
segments on genealogy websites, 
falconry and the shoddy state of the 
New York City subway system. Ah! 
Here’s an issue where I’m happy 
to bash Democratic politicians. 
President Trump, I’ll even write 
the tweet for you: “Under Governor 
Andrew Cuomo of New York 
(Highest Taxes), the failing NYC 
subway system (very important) is 
a disgrace. Totally out of control — 
BAD deals!”

It was a week that left me angry, 

stressed and anxious. And it was a 
reminder that, for all the unifying 
power of television, it has as 
much power to leave us miserable 
and outraged. Trump watches 
television 
like 
Jim 
Harbaugh 

might watch old game footage, as a 
measure of past performance and 
as a playbook for the next week. 
It’s good to want to improve, and 
natural to care about what others 
think. But it’s unhealthy to spend 
eight hours a day doing so. It makes 
Trump a worse person and a worse 
president. And if he’s going to spend 
all that time watching television, 
he might as well watch something 
good. We’re in the golden age of TV!

One 
consequence 
of 
my 

television 
habit? 
Plenty 
of 

unsolicited recommendations at 
the ready. The President might 
try NBC’s “The Good Place,” a 
chronicle of the frustrating human 
struggle to be better. Or maybe 
The CW’s “Jane the Virgin,” full of 
the twisty backstabbing he seems 
to relish, and with — fittingly — a 
hotel business in the backdrop. 
There’s always Netflix’s sumptuous 
“The Crown,” about the perils of 
mixing governing and family. If 
scripted TV is really a no-go? I’d 
recommend the delightful rebooted 
“Queer Eye,” which reminds us of 
the importance of empathy — and 
proper tailoring.

tenants of that, the yes and, the 
collaboration and the agreement.”

And 
so, 
in 
2012, 
Jackson 

and Hagenlocker formed The 
Detroit Creativity Project (DCP), 
a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization 
that provides improv training to 
Detroit middle and high schoolers 
by partnering with schools and 
community organizations.

What does bringing improv 

into Detroit public schools do? 
According to two years of research 
conducted by the University to 
determine the program’s impact, 
some really good stuff. Jackson 
explained that it’s “legit science.” 
Kids 
participating 
in 
DCP’s 

flagship program, The Improv 
Project – a semester-long course 
and summer workshop series 
that fosters social and emotional 
learning – do self-assessments 
at the beginning and end of the 
program. Jackson reports that 
many of the students at the start of 
the program self-identify for social 
anxiety, social phobia and even 
depression. However, at the end 
of 10 weeks of one hour of improv 
a week, those numbers were 
significantly reduced, attendance 
increased, test scores improved 
and – Jackson’s personal favorite 
anecdote –“students who have 
otherwise skipped school that 
day are sneaking into the improv 
classes.”

Detroit 
Public 
Schools 
are 

underperforming and students are 
constantly reminded that their low 

test scores mean they are “at risk.” 
For most kids, it seems easier to stay 
under the radar, to not raise their 
hand, to not get involved. However, 
Jackson said, “Improvisation is the 
opposite of that because in order to 
improvise you have to be involved.”

Therefore, these kids who are 

told again and again that they will 
fail, that their schools will fail, that 
they don’t matter are reminded 
that their voice matters. Improv 
reinforces 
positivity, 
creativity, 

collaboration and agreement.

“Improv teaches such good 

and respectful give-and-take and 
language 
and 
communication 

patterns that just makes life go 
better,” Jackson added. “It makes 
you a better person.”

Improv is not only for wannabe 

actors or people like me; it is for 
everyone. “Everyone should do 
it whether you have any interest 
in being on any stage of any 
kind,” Jackson said. “If my family 
improvised, I’d go home for 
Thanksgiving.”

“Improv is good for everything,” 

Jackson reiterated. “It truly is 
great for not only finding one’s 
voice and finding what you care 
about and what matters to you but 
also breaking down that barrier of 
defensiveness about there being 
only one answer and it opens you 
up to hear and to listen to and to 
accept other people’s points of view 
as well. Improv is so wonderful in 
that regard, and I think it can be a 
launch point for activism and for 

getting people involved.”

“It’s one little parenthesis in 

their (the kids’) day where what 
they say matters and they’re getting 
laughs, they’re having fun and they 
are finding their voice,” Jackson 
added. “And they are being told not 
only what you say is important, we 
need you to be here, we need you to 
participate and it’s your mind, your 
body, your voice that is creating 
this work and without it, without 
working together, without one 
another, we have nothing.”

The Detroit Creativity Project 

reminds kids that their voices 
matter, their ideas matter and most 
importantly, they matter. Because 
when you create a scene out of 
thin air, you do the impossible and 
suddenly, anything is possible.

“When you step off the back 

line in improvisation you enter 
a white room with nothing in it 
and then you paint such vivid 
pictures,” Jackson said. “It’s simply 
impossible except that it’s not if you 
do it together.” 

You can catch Marc Evan 

Jackson wreaking havoc on “The 
Good Place” as head demon Shawn 
or as Captain Ray Holt’s husband 
Kevin Cozner on “Brooklyn Nine-
Nine.” You can also tune into a 
behind-the-scenes look at “The 
Good Place” on “The Good Place: 
The Podcast” hosted by Jackson 
with guests like show creator 
Michael Shur and cast members 
like Kristen Bell, Ted Danson, 
D’Arcy Carden and more.

Politics & Kanye language

Spending 
most 
of 
my 

childhood 
in 
the 
mid-to-

late aughts, Kanye West was 
perpetually a figure within 
my peripheral understanding 
of pop culture. I couldn’t tell 
you who sang the song “Gold 
Digger” when it burned up the 
charts in 2005, but a VHS tape 
somewhere in my mom’s closet 
plays to reveal a six-year-old 
me popping and locking to it at 
my then 16-year-old cousin’s 
birthday party. Fast forward 
to the 2009 VMAs, and I could 
identify him as the guy who 
stormed onto the stage and said: 
“Yo Taylor, I’m really happy 
for you, I’ll let you finish, but 
Beyoncé has one of the best 
videos of all time.” From the 
beginning, I knew people loved 
him for his music and people 
hated him for his actions.

By the time the internet 

became an integral part of my 
daily teen life, West fascinated 
me not in his creative potential 
as a musical artist, but in his 
contributions to meme culture. 
My brothers and I laughed 
ourselves to tears, spilling hot 
popcorn on the floor when 
he infamously announced his 
decision to run for president in 
2020 at the 2015 VMAS. When 
he broke into a monologue 
on “The Ellen Show” in 2016, 
justifying his appeal to Mark 
Zuckerberg for $1 billion in 
funding for creative enterprises 
by 
proclaiming 
“Picasso 
is 

dead. Steve Jobs is dead. Walt 
Disney is dead.” I used the 
phrase for comical effect in my 
high school speech class. These 
events were parallel to my first 
encounters with rap music on 
a less-than-radio-single level, 
as artists like Kendrick Lamar 
and Travis Scott began to pique 
my interest — in no way could I 
have envisioned West as these 
rappers on an artistic level when 
his antics spoke louder than his 
music to the public.

My relationship with Kanye 

West has changed since high 
school. After a semester’s worth 
of Shazam-ing my roommate’s 
playlists during my freshman 

year, I caved in and downloaded 
The Life of Pablo, “Highlights” 
and “Fade” making frequent 
appearances on my playlists. I 
then downloaded The College 
Dropout, and Late Registration, 
and Graduation and — well, you 
get the picture. The point is, I 
saw Kanye for the artist he is 
for the first time, with his bold 
storytelling, profound skits and 
dynamic and influential sound. 
It is near impossible to find 
a popular hip-hop artist that 
has risen after Yeezy who is 
uninspired by him.

It’s for this reason I consider 

2018 more the polarizing year 
for Kanye West than the year 
of his downfall. His outbursts 
were unhinged enough for my 
mother to call me two weeks ago 
and ask, “Diana, what is wrong 
with Kone-yee West?” But his 
three main music projects of 
2018 — Daytona, Kids See Ghosts 
and ye 
 — rank amongst my top 

20 albums of the year.

I couldn’t care less about 

what celebrities have to say, 
even when they are about the 
president. However, I’d be lying 
if I said I didn’t think Kanye 
being Kanye was a bit too Kanye 
this time around. His claim that 
400 years of slavery “sounds 
like a choice” is reprehensible, 
especially given the platform 
he used to speak on behalf of 
Black rights in the past. His 
recent conversation with and 
in support of President Trump 
was haphazard and chaotic, to 
say the least — it struck me that 
he had a lot to say, but couldn’t 
coherently communicate it. It’s 
also eerie how an SNL parody 
got away with borrowing lines 
directly from this conversation 
in their recent skit.

Kanye West’s visit to the 

White House, ostensibly to 
discuss criminal justice reform, 
was a hot mess and further 
defaced his already polarizing 
image in the media. Several 
people have spoken out on 
the meeting, calling it West’s 
betrayal of a Black community 
that looked up to him as an artist 
and does not feel supported 
by the policies of our 45th. He 
has faced severe backlash and 
repercussions: 
Charlamagne 

Tha God canceled a discussion 

he was meant to have with 
West on mental illness and 
its intersection with race. To 
many people, these antics are 
perceived as departures from 
an “Old Kanye” that famously 
declared “George Bush doesn’t 
care 
about 
black 
people” 

following 
mismanaged 
relief 

efforts after Katrina wiped out 
much of New Orleans. A Kanye 
that was proud and Black. This 
was not the same Kanye that 
rapped “racism is still alive, we 
just be concealing it” on The 
College Dropout.

Perhaps there is some validity 

to these claims: Even West 
says that his opinions have 
changed over the years. But he 
perceives it as something more 
fluid, his thoughts evolving 
rather than him losing touch 
with his past. After all, this 
isn’t Yeezy’s first time flirting 
with alt-right imagery; in 2013, 
he unsuccessfully attempted to 
re-appropriate the Confederate 
flag by selling it on his Yeezus 
tour merch. This also isn’t his 
first 
time 
showing 
support 

for 
Trump: 
In 
2016, 
West 

announced he would’ve voted 
for Trump in the presidential 
election at the tour for an album 
in which he raps “Hands up we 
just doing what the cops taught 
us / Hands up, hands up then 
the cops shot us.”

As 
ostensible 
and 
brash 

as he may be, Kanye West is 
more complex than we give 
him credit for. He shows this 
in his response to criticism, 
claiming that the divisive power 
of 
political 
parties 
doesn’t 

help to solve racism, hence 
his acknowledgment of praise 
for Trump — it’s worth noting 
his non-album single “Ye vs. 
The People” explores the same 
idea. Though far-fetched, the 
rapper’s ideas by no means stray 
from nobility to the roots that 
shaped him. Perhaps things 
stand out more now than before 
because they come from a time 
where we listen to what Kanye 
says because he’s Kanye, not 
because The College Dropout 
is performing well. At a time 
where his personality earns 
more critique than his music, 
it’s not hard to misunderstand 
the musician.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK


The most worthwhile aim 

of director George Tillman, 
Jr.’s (“Notorious”) ambitious 
adaption of Angie Thomas’s 
multifaceted 2017 YA novel 
“The Hate U Give” is its 
complex portrayal of modern-
day 
activism. 
Though 
the 

film often struggles against 
the 
constraints 
of 
homage 

to its source text, the film 
still succeeds in making this 
eloquent political statement all 
its own, and such a statement 
could not have come at a better 
time. In an era where the socio-
political climate ask questions 
like “What do Americans stand 
for?” and “Can we believe 
anything we see or hear?” the 
film refuses to shy away from 
them. In its brashness, it works 
to rebuild the reputation of 
American civil society and 
restore needed momentum to 
truth. 

Riffing on Tupac’s “Thug 

Life” — i.e. “The Hate U 
Give 
Little 
Infants 
Fucks 

Everybody” 
— 
the 
film 

follows Black teenager Starr 
Carter 
(Amandla 
Stenberg, 

“Everything, Everything”) as 
she reels from this hate with 
which she has been given since 
birth. The narrative addresses 
the range of this hate, from 
the micro-aggressions Starr 
endures 
at 
the 
hands 
of 

her 
predominantly 
white 

classmates at the elite prep 
school she attends, to the 
explicit racism at the turning 
point of the film: when Starr is 
the sole witness to the murder 
of her childhood friend Khalil 
(Algee Smith, “Detroit”) at the 
hands of a white cop. 

The latter trauma forces 

Starr to undertake an agonizing 
but vital journey in pursuit 
of 
a 
genuine, 
productive, 

justice-centered 
breed 
of 

activism that will be familiar 
to some audience members 
but epiphanic to others. Along 

the way, she gains exposure 
to ideal, real and counterfeit 
activism 
— 
alongside 
the 

confidence to build her own 
vision thereof.

Lawyer April Ofrah (Issa 

Rae, “Insecure”), who mentors 
Starr as she decides whether 
she will testify before the 
grand jury that will determine 
whether the cop who killed 
Khalil will be indicted, is the 
representative of ideal activism. 

While some characters in the 
film came across as little more 
than mouthpieces to articulate 
themes the storytellers hadn’t 
the time to convey through 
characters’ 
action, 
Rae’s 

performance stands out. Her 
speeches are among the most 
memorable 
points 
in 
the 

film’s 2:12 runtime, especially 
her impassioned defense of 
nonviolent protest as an ideal 
protest at Khalil’s funeral. She 
raises a particularly resonant 
question in this speech as well: 
How can Black people ever be 
seen as unarmed if their skin is 
considered a weapon? She thus 
charges the media with the 
task of deescalating violence, 
challenging the media to stop 
weaponizing race.

Tillman, Jr. also stresses 

the oft-distorted realities of 
activism through ground-level 
shots of protest scenes. These 
unmediated scenes reimagine 
resistance. In one, resistance 
is chanting the names of the 
unjustly killed in the streets. 
In 
another, 
resistance 
is 

holding up your cell phone 
— nonviolently policing the 
police. In a climactic scene 

and affirmation of Stenberg’s 
talent, resistance is standing 
on the hood of a car, screaming 
a eulogy of your murdered 
friend 
into 
a 
megaphone 

while police ready the tear 
gas. One constant, heartening 
variable across these scenes of 
resistance is the instrumental 
role youth play in them.

Imposter activism appears 

in two forms. First, we see it 
in those who selfishly pretend 
to stand for just causes. Starr’s 
white classmates embody this 
treachery in a particularly 
sickening 
scene 
where 

Starr’s 
friends 
reveal 
that 

their primary motivation for 
attending a protest for Khalil’s 
case is so they can leave school 
early. The second form appears 
in those who misrepresent 
protest efforts to undermine 
it. 
Tillman, 
Jr. 
carefully 

juxtaposes the raw scenes of 
civil disobedience with the 
media-packaging 
thereof, 

exposing 
the 
disparities 

between 
activism 
and 
its 

imposter dominating television 
news.

Herein lies a weakness in 

the film, however. While some 
of its deliberate ambiguities 
were 
productive 
— 
for 

instance, the moral ambiguity 
of every character subverted 
the mass media’s reliance on 
simply casting figures as good 
and evil to neglect the more 
complex systems of evil which 
individuals 
either 
consent 

to or resist — others were 
detrimental. 
An 
inordinate 

number of subplots (the most 
confounding of which focused 
on Starr’s white boyfriend) and 
contrived scenes that served 
as little more than an homage 
to Thomas’ novel ate up time, 
leaving audiences in want of 
more direct evaluations of the 
media’s role in systemic issues. 

Nonetheless, the necessity of 

the film’s well-argued message 
about activism renders it a 
film not only worth seeing but 
perhaps obligatory if we hope 
to reinvigorate civil society.

“Let’s cry and watch shitty 

Netflix shows together,” my best 
friend texted me on Oct. 6th, the 
same day that the full Senate 
voted on the nomination of Judge 
Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme 
Court Justice. Any other day, 
poking fun at less than average 
actors and oddly placed camera 
angles while sobbing into a bowl 
of Ben and Jerry’s would’ve cured 
my sadness almost instantly. 
But as I cuddled next to my best 
friend, a woman I knew had 
been a victim to the same type of 
sexual assault our new Supreme 
Court Justice was accused of, I 
could only feel the sadness and 
anger I held within myself even 
more viscerally. The days that 
followed that Oct. 6th nomination 
were days I spent listening to 
survivors of sexual assault. I 
couldn’t believe that nearly all 
of my female identifying friends 
had experienced sexual assault 
in one way or another. Actually, 
now that I think about, it really 
isn’t that hard for me to believe.

I decided that I wanted to 

create a space where my friends 
could talk to one another about 
their experiences as a woman in 
the United States of America. On 
one Friday afternoon, I invited 
them over to my house for coffee. 
We sat down and listened to 
each other, in the way that Dr. 
Christine Blasey Ford should’ve 
been listened to. We didn’t just 
listen —but we believed.

We shared stories about our 

bottoms being grabbed without 
consent while dancing at parties. 
We talked about being cat called 
while walking to lecture. Of our 
male teachers asking us to stay 
for a little too long after class, 
looking too closely at new blouses 
that had been purchased. My 
Black friends shared stories about 
them going on dates with boys 
who fetishized their Blackness, 
saying “I’ve only ever dated 
white girls before. You’re pretty 
exotic.” We talked to one another 
for nearly four hours that day, and 
at the end of the conversation, 

the walls of my room seemed to 
sigh with us in exhaustion after 
having listened to all we have 
gone through. We reached one 
unfortunate conclusion with our 
discussion: There didn’t seem 
to be much hope of anything 
getting better. Especially, when 
this man, who has publicly been 

accused of committing the same 
type of violence toward women 
we experience daily, holds one of 
the highest and most respected 
positions in our government.

As women, how are we to 

believe that we are respected 
when the men who have openly 
shown blatant disrespect toward 
us have all of the power in our 
politics? Often times, I feel that 
people separate politics and the 
human condition. I hear a lot that 
“political views don’t define a 
person as good or bad.” I believe 
that in some cases this can be 
true. However, I find it difficult to 
look at my older brother, an open 
supporter of Brett Kavanaugh, 
and believe that he respects 
me and my place as a woman in 
this society. I don’t want to see 

my brother, someone I love, as 
someone who does not see me as 
a human being worthy of being 
listened to. But I worry that if 
I approached him and told him 
of that one time in high school, 
when a boy held my thigh for a 
little too long and that escalated 
to the boy holding other parts of 
me for way too long, would my 
brother believe me when I told 
him I didn’t want it? Would my 
brother tell me my skirt was too 
short? Would he tell me I got too 
drunk that night? That I had too 
much beer? Would he follow the 
same logic that Brett Kavanaugh 
and the rest of the Republican 
Party seems to follow when 
excusing themselves for their 
actions against women? I’m not 
sure I want to know the answer.

Answers are something I have 

been looking for a lot since early 
Oct. One question in particular 
I wish I could answer was 
asked to me the very night of 
the nomination. I tried to make 
my arms into a fort that would 
protect my best friend as she 
quivered beneath my embrace, 
but I don’t think I have the power 
to save her from a nation that 
refuses to even acknowledge 
she has anything to be saved 
from. She cried into my shoulder, 
and the question I wish I could 
resolve emerged in between her 
tears:

“If they didn’t believe her, 

when she gave that kind of a 
speech, when she has those kind 
of degrees, when all of America is 
watching, why in the hell would 
anyone ever believe me?”

I believed her, though. That 

isn’t enough, but, in that moment, 
it needed to be. The women 
sitting in my bedroom the 
following week believed her. And 
maybe we don’t have any power 
right now. Maybe we don’t have 
any voice that people want to 
hear. Maybe our country doesn’t 
view us beyond a sexual object. 
Maybe 
we 
aren’t 
respected, 

or listened to or believed right 
now. But we will be. We need to 
be. This shouldn’t be a battle we 
have to fight, but it is. We need to 
believe one another. We need to 
believe her. I believe her. Do you?

In the 2018 fashion scene, 

what you’re wearing is either 
conformity 
or 
rebellion. 

Laws of fashion hold us to 
this standard, but in wake of 
changes in political climate, 
tensions in our government 
are shaping the fashion world 
as well. Or rather, the fashion 
world is contributing to the 
shape politics are taking today. 
With primaries under our belts, 
midterms on the horizon and 
a new Supreme Court Justice 
sworn in, among other world 
altering events, it seems as 
though we will never be able to 
keep up with these variations 
and their effects on our political 
system. As new movements 
and conflicts rise and fall, the 
fashion world follows suit. And 
although hard to believe, new 

trends in everyday fashion are 
seriously 
impacting 
politics 

and how we share our views, as 
we can quite literally wear our 
opinions on our sleeves. 

The 
prominence 
of 
the 

t-shirt has been present in 
fashion since the beginning of 
time. Its simplicity, practicality 
and comfort have upheld this 
iconic design as a staple in style 
and fashion. But, as fashion 
has evolved and trends have 
changed, so has the t-shirt. 
In recent years, graphic tees 
have centered themselves as 
a pinnacle of a very curated, 
eclectic, 
carefree 
aesthetic. 

Starting in the ’70s with the 
popularity of repping band 
logos, the graphic tee has since 
only evolved to reach corners 
of all industries beyond just 
music. 

They have worked their way 

into everyday wardrobes, they 

can be dressed up or down and 
there is certainly no limit to 
content that can be printed on 
a t-shirt. In just single stores 
alone, whole sections have 
become dedicated to the trend 
of graphic tees. The curated 
aesthetic created by centering 
an outfit around a graphic tee 
is one many teens and young 
people strive for, sometimes 
perhaps without even realizing 
what message they are sending 
by wearing certain graphics. 
As graphics have seeped their 
way into the closets of style 
gurus everywhere, so they have 
also headed up many political 
movements, completely altering 
the way these movements are 
viewed.

The clearest example has to 

be the women’s movement. In 
the 2017 Women’s March on 
Washington, 
tees 
imprinted 

with “Nasty Woman”, “Raise

Boys and Girls the Same Way” 
and “This Pussy Grabs Back” 
made the amount of voice 
coming from the event almost 
double, as the presence of 
these words on shirts serve 
as a constant visual reminder 
of these women’s rightfully 
justified 
angerwith 
our 

government and president in 
addition to their conversations 
surrounding gender equality in 
politics. 

We 
see 
these 
graphics 

stating “Black Lives Matter,” 
“#MeToo,” 
the 
LGBTQ 

movement and even the t-shirt 
Frank Ocean wore to the 
Panorama Music festival called 
on audiences to just be quiet 
before being racist, sexist or 
homophobic. 

These examples don’t cover 

even half of the political content 
that graphic tees have begun 
to cover in recent years. It is a 
beautiful concept, to have the 
ability to take ownership over 
one’s political views and raise 
awareness about movements 
for change is an extremely 
empowering concept, one that 
is allowing more and more 
people to be included in the 
groups represented by these 
shirts and graphics. To be able 
to incorporate political views 
into everyday wardrobe truly 
combines the best of both 
politics and fashion, but while 
this stylish alternative seems 
oh-so-chic, there’s a fine line 

between the intersectionalities 
that 
lie 
within 
this 

incorporation 
of 
graphics 

and politics that can make 
for a challenging difference 
between representing political 
views 
and 
movements 
and 

just wearing certain tops as 
an accessory rather than for 
raising actual awareness and 
culminating change. 

Graphic tees serve as a 

great opportunity for raising 
political awareness, but with 
so many of them circulating 
the fashion world, the purpose 
of this fashion staple has 
very 
quickly 
become 
more 

of a solely aesthetic choice 
or form of bandwagoning as 
opposed to an actual effort to 
benefit political movements. 
The consumer or producer 
cannot take the blame for this 
strange cycle; it’s practically 
impossible 
to 
avoid 
when 

stores like Urban Outfitters 
have added “Vote” tees to 
their graphic tee collection, 
inviting young people to start 
purchasing them, with half of 
them not even sure if they’re 
registered to vote. Graphic tees 
make it so easy to get behind a 
moment, creating a challenging 
double-edged sword to grapple 
with. To truly take ownership 
and proudly wear a “Nasty 
Woman” t-shirt, be prepared 
to vote, participate in marches 
and stay in the loop about 
current events is completely 

different from purchasing the 
shirt solely because you saw 
another girl looking cute in 
it on Instagram. With social 
media shaping politics, there 
is a certain vulnerability that 
comes with sharing political 
views 
or 
rallying 
behind 

movements. Sometimes it can 
make people feel as though 
they need to prove themselves 
in 
a 
certain 
way, 
hence 

causing 
over-compensation 

in items like graphic tees for 
various movements, even if 
it isn’t something the person 
is 
completely 
invested 
or 

educated in.

Both 
extremely 
powerful 

tools 
in 
society, 
fashion 

and social media are truly 
influencing 
the 
way 
we 

perceive politics. With both 
of these platforms, we as 
individuals are now, more than 
ever, more capable of making 
politics an inclusive topic, one 
where we can help others learn 
about things they might not 
be as familiar with in order to 
benefit the greater good and 
truly change our government. 
So let’s selectively choose those 
graphic tees, and curate them 
to things we truly know about, 
encouraging our friends to 
become politically aware and 
create inclusive spaces in a field 
that can sometimes seem so 
uninviting and confusing. Let 
us fashionably make a change 
in politics.

FILM REVIEW

As women, how 
are we to believe 

that we are 

respected when 
the men who’ve 
openly shown 

blatant disrespect 

toward us have 

all of the power in 

our politics?


his campaign slogan “Make 
America Great Again” is meant 
to be an act of reclamation, the 
execution 
leaves 
something 

to be desired. In fact, many of 
these 
ridiculous 
soundbites 

have become commodified into 
t-shirts, hats and other forms 
of apparel. When these words 
are converted into vehicles for 
corporate exploitation, the value 
of retaliating against Trump’s 
malicious words is essentially 
neutralized and lost. The same 
goes for Trump supporters trying 
to reclaim critiques of Trump; 
during the 2016 presidential 
race, Hillary Clinton’s comment 
about Trump supporters being 
a “basket of deplorables” was 
reclaimed as a positive label and 
a literal symbol of pride among 
Trump’s most loyal advocates.

Today’s 
political 
memes 

operate 
as 
a 
frustrating 

paradox: In one sense, they 
capture the absurdity of the 
current 
administration 
and 

American politics as a whole, 
but 
simultaneously, 
they 

can 
normalize 
and 
enable 

problematic discourse, granting 
Trump and other like-minded 
bigots 
more 
exposure 
and 

attention. It’s an accessible, yet 
counterproductive 
and 
lazy 

tactic that only amplifies these 
dangerous platforms. Political 
memes may be uplifting as 
rallying cries at protests, and in 

some cases, their impact could 
enlighten and inspire people to 
get more involved in political 
discussions. 
But 
considering 

the wider effect modern-day 

political memes engender, they 
really do nothing but satisfy 
and reinforce the political self-
interest of the person making the 
meme and the people they share 
it with.

Despite 
the 
smugness 

underlying 
today’s 
political 

memes, they still have the 
potential to influence political 
conversation for the better. Vic 
Berger, a video editor for the 
now-defunct Super Deluxe and 
an outspoken critic of Trump, 
juxtaposes real-life interviews 
and mishaps made by Trump and 
other members of the GOP with 
uncomfortable zoom-ins on their 
faces and jarring sound effects 
(most notably the sound of an 
air horn). The result is surreal, 
strange, hilarious and sometimes 
harrowing. Instead of merely 
using Trump’s words against 
him, Berger brilliantly conveys 
that American politics is as 
farcical as it is terrifying. Other 
online users have capitalized on 
fabricating celebrity clickbait 
as a way to get people to vote, a 
strategy that, while certainly 
manipulative, 
deserves 
some 

recognition for its cleverness.

If memes reflect and dictate 

the conversation surrounding 
trends in pop culture, political 
memes should find a way to do 
the same with the conversation 
surrounding trends in politics. 
And if political memes have the 
power to change the way we 
understand politics, then they 
should at least have the courtesy 
to communicate an incentive 
that’s both entertaining and 
compelling.

In 
other 
words: 
meme 

responsibly.

NEW MEDIA NOTEBOOK

It’s no secret that social media 

is a volatile virtual battleground 
where both ends of the political 
spectrum clash and converge on 
hot-button topics. But amid the 
mucky mess of heated Twitter 
threads 
and 
essay-length 

Facebook posts, people seem to 
have found comfort and stability 
through arguably the greatest 
postmodern art form produced 
on the internet: memes.

Like most general memes, a 

political meme can be a source 
of humor, a comedic avenue 
that connects and familiarizes 
us with political figures and 
social issues that, in a real-
world context, aren’t nearly 
as engaging. They shape the 
way we understand those who 
govern our country, either by 
poking fun at their out-of-touch 
personalities or championing 
their ability to identify with the 
American public.

The “meme-ing” of President 

Obama, 
in 
particular, 
was 

impactful in how the internet 

and American society at large 
perceived him during his time in 
office. The relatability of his cool, 
friendly demeanor translated 
well online, whether through 
his goofy facial expressions, his 
interactions 
with 
celebrities 

or 
his 
endearing 
bromance 

with former Vice President Joe 
Biden. His supporters would 
re-contextualize 
photos 
and 

videos of him as humorous and 
silly, while his critics would 
depict him in an offensive and 
oftentimes racist light.

“Thanks Obama,” a common 

sarcastic 
critique 
meant 
to 

ridicule Obama’s mistakes, was 
reclaimed as a satirical, self-
deprecating meme by liberals 
and 
even 
Obama 
himself. 

Former First Lady Michelle also 
garnered quite a bit of internet 
exposure. Originally used in a 
video promoting healthy eating, 
Michelle’s anecdote about her 
favorite fall vegetable (a sweet 
potato) and her quip about 
turnips (“Turnip for What”) 
quickly circulated on Vine and 
across the Web. Even after 
Barack’s second term ended, he 
and Michelle remain internet 

icons; 
their 
laid-back 
post-

presidency vacation photos and 
lavish 
presidential 
portraits 

provoked a series of memes on 
Twitter, many of which praised 
the couple for relishing their 
time away from the chaos of the 
White House.

While political memes like 

these can be innocuous, they 
also have the capacity to be 
simplistic, ruthless and even 
sinister. In the age of Trump 
especially, 
they’ve 
become 

weaponized 
by 
liberals 
and 

conservatives alike to combat 
one another online, manifesting 
in the form of tongue-in-cheek 
and trenchant jabs at Democrats 
and Republicans, senators and 
political 
commentators 
and, 

perhaps most of all, the President

To me, the best part of the 

installation 
was 
watching 

people’s feet. It’s rare to see 

crowds of people 
collectively 
handling 
things 

gently, but if you 
looked 
at 
the 

ground 
at 
the 

spaces in between 
the books, you’d 
see a lot of fully 
grown 
adults 

carefully making 
their way through 
the 
dark 
street 

on their tiptoes. 
Nobody wanted to 
damage the books, 
and 
if 
anybody 

stepped 
on 
one 

accidentally, they 
would 
almost 

instinctively 
jump back. One 
guy was tripping 
over 
himself, 

trying to run through the 
crowd while shouting, “WE 
WON’T HURT THE BOOKS, 
WE 
WON’T 
HURT 
THE 

BOOKS.” Everybody around 
him instantly cleared a path 
— a collective agreement that 
books are at least a little bit 

precious, and we all want to 
protect precious things.

It’s quarter to 8:00, I’m 

walking home from The Daily 
newsroom 
and 
about 
five 

minutes in I’m very perplexed 
by 
the 
mass 
of 
people 

surrounding the intersection 
of State and Liberty. Ann 
Arbor streets only ever get 
this crowded for big sports 
victories, 
but 
the 
patient 

huddle gathered in front of me 
was quite the polar opposite 
of a revelrous, drunken mass. 
I had seen the metric ton of 
tomes coming back from class 
earlier in the day, but I thought 
it was nothing more than a 
24-hour art installation — and 
despite the sheer volume of 
books on the street, my lasting 
reaction was “cool.” Yet it just 
happened that I stumbled into 
the main event of “Literature 
vs. Traffic” like I do most good 
things in my life: accidentally. 
Albeit what I think is a silly 
name (if you actually want 
to pit the two entities against 
each other then remove the 
barricades, you cowards) I 
slyly sauntered my way into 
the magic of the moment. I 
heard around me that once the 

clock struck 8:00 any book on 
the pavement was ripe for the 
picking. My phone read 7:50 
but I think the fact kids were 
allowed to peruse the literary 
lot early made onlookers a 
little jumpy, so I dove in when 
there was enough people in the 
middle for me to go unnoticed. 
My first intention was to find 
“great books” that I had long 
missed out on and finally get 
an excuse to read them, but 
when the first cover I flipped 
over was “Heart of Darkness” 
I realized I wasn’t doing this 
right. 
Instead 
I 
trounced 

around looking for the most 
unwieldy shapes and bizarre 
illustrations. In a sentence I 
hope has never been written 
before, a giddy smile was 
brought to my face when the 
cover of a book I picked up read 
“L. Ron Hubbard: Scientology 
and 
the 
Fundamentals 
of 

Thought.” My coffee table is all 
the weirder now with pickups 
like 
“Decorative 
Victorian 

Needlework” and a Matlab 
textbook entirely in Chinese. 
Street books, thank you for 
being surreal, mysterious and 
a reminder of why we love to 
read in the first place.

BOOKS EVENT

This Tuesday Oct. 23, a public 

art project by the University’s 
Institute for Humanities called 
“Literature vs. Traffic” was 
installed on Liberty St. Over 
10,000 books covered the street 
all day, and pedestrians were 
invited to walk through the 
books and pick from them at 
night. Among the thousands 
of Ann Arbor residents who 
experienced the display were 
three 
Daily 
Book 
Review 

writers. These are their stories:

I went to the “Literature vs. 

Traffic” installment twice on 
Tuesday, once in the daylight 
and once after dark. In the 
daylight, the books looked 
like a scene straight from that 
Russian avant-garde film “The 
Color of Pomegranates” (you 
should talk to Emily Yang 
about it), their sun-dappled 
pages rustling ever so slightly 
in the breeze, giving the entire 
installment a sense of gentle 
motion — reliable aliveness, 
like that of an ocean. My 
daylight visit was before they 
opened the gates to the rabid 
bibliophiles, but let me tell 
you that didn’t stop them. I 

witnessed an elderly woman 
hop the fence and tiptoe out 
into the sea of novels and 
pick up one in particular that 
caught her eye. On the other 
side of the installment, one 
of the volunteers noticed and 
yelled “HEY, HEY, DON’T 
DO THAT YET! PUT DOWN 
THAT BOOK!” Pure comedy, 
heightened by the imagery of 
the fence around all the books, 
not unlike the fence penning 
in the little concrete stack 
of books statue outside the 
Clements library, which always 
just licked my funny bone. Isn’t 
it massively hypocritical to 
erect fences around our books, 
even the representative ones?

I stole away from my job for 

20 minutes at night to revisit 
the installment, my interest 
piqued from all the weird 
books students were bringing 
to 
the 
Perlman 
Honors 

Commons. On my power walk 
over, I witnessed student after 
student 
carrying 
veritable 

armfuls of weird, old, LED-
illuminated titles, something 
I doubt I’ll ever see again. The 
eavesdropping 
was 
prime: 

“Where is everyone getting 
all these books? The local 
bookstore?” “No, they’re in 
the street.” In the thick of the 

installment, pawing through 
these 
strange, 
picked-over 

tomes, I felt the weird sort 
of urgency one experiences 
in a crowded store: the need 
to 
examine 
all 

the items, to find 
the one you want 
before 
someone 

else does. It’s a 
slimy feeling. At 
least in this case, 
it was cut a little 
by 
a 
collective 

mirth 
at 
the 

bizarre selection. 
The 
guy 
next 

to me pondered 
aloud who would 
need 
a 
volume 

of 
homeopathic 

remedies 
for 

maternity 
pains, 

and 
the 
woman 

ahead 
chuckled 

at a guide to DIY 
RV 
maintenance. 

I 
left 
with 
an 

ancient copy of W. 
Somerset Maugham’s “Cakes 
and Ale” that I had once seen 
on a postcard, and “Charles 
Schwab’s Guide to Financial 
Independence” 
in 
Chinese 

because I’m not sure when I’m 
ever going to encounter that 
again.
