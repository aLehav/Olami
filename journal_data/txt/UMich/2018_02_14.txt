The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Central Student 
Government 
convened 

Tuesday evening to discuss 
underrepresentation 
of 

students 
in 
STEM 
fields 

and the conflicts of interest 
present 
in 
the 
University 

endowment. 
The 
assembly 

also 
voted 
on 
resolutions 

regarding the availability of 
resources 
through 
Sexual 

Assault 
Prevention 
and 

Awareness Center and the 
greater use of clean energy 
sources by the University.

The meeting began with 

a presentation from guest 

speaker Jeff Irwin, former 
Democratic 
member 
of 

the 
Michigan 
House 
of 

Representatives 
and 
LSA 

student 
government 
alum. 

Irwin 
told 
the 
assembly 

about the history of the Ann 
Arbor Tenants’ Union and 
the importance of students 
being informed of their rights 
as tenants. Many housing 
contracts contain illegalities 
students may not be aware 
of, according to Irwin. These 
contract issues contribute to 
the broader concern regarding 
student housing in Ann Arbor, 
on campus and off.

“Off-campus 
housing 
is 

the biggest issue that every 
student has to deal with here 

Peter Baker, the chief White 

House correspondent for The 
New York Times, discussed 
his new book, “Obama: The 
Call of History,” to a crowd of 
about 200 people at the Gerald 
R. Ford Presidential Library 
Tuesday. 

As 
a 
mainstay 
on 
the 

coverage of modern American 
presidency, Baker has covered 
Bill 
Clinton, 
George 
W. 

Bush, 
Barack 
Obama 
and 

the current Donald Trump 
administration. 
During 

his 20-year tenure at The 
Washington Post and most 
recently at The New York 
Times, Baker has established 
an 
intimate 
rapport 
with 

some of the most powerful 
figures in American politics. 
This lecture was first Baker’s 
return to Ann Arbor since 
2009.

It was these journalistic 

experiences, 
behind 
the 

disciplined facade of the 44th 
president, 
which 
inspired 

Baker to collaborate with New 
York 
Times 
photographers 

and 
publish 
a 
book 
that 

presents a portrait of the first 
African-American president.

“I wanted to write a book 

about 
President 
Obama 

because I felt like he is in 
some ways one of the most 
interesting 
presidents 
we 

have had,” Baker said. “Partly 
because we don’t really know 

who he is. We have struggled 
his entire time in public life 
to define who Barack Obama 
is, what his presidency meant 
and how we see him in the 
context of history.” 

Described by presidential 

historian Michael Beschloss 
as “an acute observer of the 
modern presidency,” Baker 
anchored his new book on the 
enigmatic legacy of Obama. 
According to Baker, he was 

arguably the first introvert 
in Oval Office since Jimmy 
Carter, a characteristic that 
Baker became well attuned to 
while covering the president.

“He was opaque even to 

those of us who covered him 
day in and day out,” Baker 
said. “When he came to the 
back of the plane on Air Force 
One to visit the press in the 
back, there wasn’t any of this 
sort of chit-chat, ‘Hey, how 

is the family going.’ It was 
all business. He came back 
because he wanted to say 
something. He was always 
very, very crisp and business-
like. He didn’t let his guard 
down. He didn’t give you 
playful nicknames like Bush 
would give us, and he didn’t 
tell us old Ozark tales like Bill 
Clinton would tell you.”

However, some audience 

A year after hackers sent 

racist 
and 
anti-Semitic 

emails 
to 
engineering 
and 

computer science students, the 
University is still dealing with 
concerns regarding internet 
security — especially in the 
context of accurate security 
alerts reaching students on 
campus.

Just 
last 
month, 
many 

students received an email 
encouraging them to download 
Wildfire, a new safety alert 
system application. The email, 
designed to appear as though 
it came from the University 
of Michigan’s administration, 
was not sent by or affiliated 
with the University — a note 
only made available to students 
in the fine print at the bottom 
of the email.

In fact, the administration 

never approved of the app at all, 
citing conflict and confusion 
that could arise from students 
receiving 
emergency 
alerts 

from two different sources.

The University of Michigan 

Board of Regents is set to vote 
on a proposal to rebuild Camp 
Davis Rocky Mountain Field 
Station near Jackson, Wyoming 
at this Thursday’s meeting. The 
project, estimated to cost $6.5 
million, would demolish the 
old cabins and bathhouses and 
construct 30 new ones, along 
with a recreational facility.

Camp Davis is a summer 

program 
by 
the 
LSA 

Department 
of 
Earth 
and 

Environmental 
Sciences 

in which students can take 
introductory 
courses 
in 

geology, 
environmental 

science and the humanities. 
The facility is located near 
Yellowstone 
National 
Park 

and Grand Teton National 
Park, providing an outdoor 
classroom to incorporate into 
the curriculum.

The current 120-acre field 

station was built in 1929 and 
has been offering the summer 
courses 
every 
year 
since.

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: LSA MASS MEETING PLANS 
CREATION OF STUDENT UNION

LOVE BUG

On Monday, the University 

of 
Michigan’s 
Lecturers’ 

Employee 
Organization 

released 
a 
call 
to 
allies 

for 
support 
against 
the 

administration’s 
salary 

proposal for lecturers.

The LEO is comprised of 

lecturers from all three U-M 
campuses. 
Currently, 
the 

minimum salary for a full-
time lecturer is $34,500 in Ann 
Arbor, $28,300 in Dearborn 
and $27,300 in Flint. The LEO 
has 
been 
bargaining 
with 

the University since October 
for higher wages, better job 
security and improved benefits.

On Monday night, in response 

to initial requests from the 
LEO, the University proposed a 

$1,000 increase to the starting 
salary in 2019, $750 in 2020 and 
$500 in 2021. According to the 
LEO statement, the University’s 
proposal also included a 1.5 
percent annual raise for Ann 
Arbor 
employees, 
but 
not 

Dearborn or Flint lecturers.

“Our members are stunned, 

insulted, and outraged,” the 
LEO statement reads. “In the 
past 14 years, Lecturers have 
seen a 11 percent overall raise 
in minimum salary. In that 
same time period, tuition has 
increased roughly 90 percent.”

According to the LEO press 

release, the administration’s 
proposal Monday night gave 
the impression lecturers were 
highly replaceable employees. 

“Administration began their 

proposal by telling us that 
Lecturers 
cannot 
complain 

about 
this 
exploitation 

because with the current job 

market, they are more or less 
disposable,” 
the 
statement 

reads.

In response to the proposal, 

the LEO is staging a grade-in 
before the University Board 
of Regents meeting on Feb. 15. 

The LEO plans on speaking 

at the meeting as well and is 
calling for students, faculty 
and community members to 
show support for the LEO 
by attending the grade-in, 
joining their action listserv 
and spreading the word.

By Chris Steele

At a mass meeting on language 

requirements last night students 
voted to establish a literary college 
student union and to stage a boycott 
if the faculty takes unfavorable 
action on the language requirement 
at its next meeting, March 3. 

A call for a disruption sit in in 

Dean William Hay’s office today 
was approved on a first vote, but 
was reconstructed and defeated at 
the request of its sponsor, Radical 
Caucus, because it failed to gather a 
large enough vote. 

The motion for the student union 

was made by Daily Editor Mark 
Levin. He called for a referendum 
on the language requirement to be 
held in the next two weeks. 

In making his proposal Level 

called a disruptive sit-in a “very 
ineffective tactic” which would 
not bring effective “pressure on 
faculty members/” A disruptive sit-
in would only result in suspensions 
and arrests, he said. 

Several Radical Caucus members 

voiced objection to the student 
union proposal. Eric Chester, Grad, 
said “It’s a stall.” He conceded the 
disruptive sit-in might fail but the 
real question was “intimidation.” 
“Are we going to let the legislature 
and the faculty intimidate us?” he 
asked. 

Parliamentary action followed 

in which an unsuccessful attempt 
was made to combine Levin’s 
proposal with the Radical Caucus 
sponsored sit-in. Levin’s proposal 
was eventually passed by a vote 105 
to 96. 

A 
short 
discussion 
of 
the 

implementation of Levin’s motion 
followed the one hour debate on the 
major proposals from Levin, Radical 
Caucus and another student. 

The 
meeting 
named 
three 

students to recommend members 
of a provisional steering committee 
which would organize the student 
union. The three students are 
Radical Caucus chairman Marty 
McLaughlin, Ron Landsman, ‘70, 

and Bill Bleich, ‘69. 

The motion for the disruptive 

sit-in was introduced by Bernard 
Elbaum, ‘71, a Radical Cacaus 
member. His motion called for a 
sit-in in the LSA building to begin 
at 1 p.m. today. Students sitting-in 
would have locked all doors and 
remained in the building until the 
language requirement was abolish. 

The Radical Caucus motion was 

passed by a vote of 114 to 86, but was 
later withdrawn. 

McLaughlin moved to reconsider 

the motion and to defeat it because 
there were not enough people to 
support the sit-in. 

Radical Caucus had previously 

pledged to reconsider the motion 
if there were not 200 people in 
support. 

The vote following McLaughlin’s 

motion 
was 
overwhelmingly 

against the disruptive sit-in. 

Debate on how to arrange 

the referendum on the language 
requirements failed to reach any 
definite conclusion.

at the University of Michigan 
… This (is) an issue that 
connects all students,” Irwin 
said.

As the election for new CSG 

representatives 
approaches, 

the 
assembly 
touched 
on 

the need to remain civil and 
fair during campaigning and 
election season. Guest speaker 
Brian Koziara, a University 
Law Student and Yale School 
of 
Management 
student, 

stressed to assembly members 
the importance of respect and 
politeness during the election 
process.

“Remember to be civil, and 

to be kind, “ Koziara said. 
“(You) should act like the CSG 
you want to see in the world.” 

Community 
concerns 

included 
those 
of 
food 

insecurity 
on 
campus. 

The 
University 
is 
the 

only university in the Big 
Ten that does not have a 
university-sponsored 
food 

pantry available to students, 
according to the assembly. 
According to the speakers 
and CSG President Anushka 
Sarkar, an LSA senior, Ann 
Arbor is currently considered 
a food desert, with the nearest 
grocery store a bus or car ride 
away from campus.

“I think this is an important 

first step,” Sarkar said.

Additionally, 
with 
the 

limited dining hall hours and 
lack of affordable nutritious 
food options near campus, 
pressure is being put on the 
University to invest resources 
into addressing this issue. A 
resolution 
was 
introduced 

during the meeting to push 
the University to provide both 
initial and consistent funding 
for a food bank for students, 
as well as the possibility 
of granting financial aid to 
students who are considered 
“food insecure.”

Sarkar mentioned efforts 

to implement a new Wellness 
Zone 
on 
North 
Campus, 

following the creation of the 
first location in the Michigan 
Union in 2011. There are also 
plans to host a meet-and-
greet event in the coming 
weeks in order for students 
to engage with their CSG 
representatives. The release 
of 
CSG’s 
second 
annual 

demographic report has been 
proposed as well.

The 
meeting 
concluded 

with the passing of multiple 
resolutions, 
including 

further 
exploration 
into 

the 
University’s 
potential 

transition from fossil fuels to 
cleaner energy sources, and 
further revision of the CSG 
election code.

members 
said 
they 
found 

themselves wishing for Baker 
to share more of these quirky 
anecdotes from his career as a 
prolific journalist.

Engineering and Business 

junior Kevin Li noted he 
wanted to hear more of Baker’s 
own experience reporting in 
the White House.

“I think overall I wish he had 

spent a little more time talking 
about specific observations 
he could have made as White 
House 
chief 
correspondent 

for The New York Times,” 
he said. “I really enjoyed the 
stuff about how Biden would 
tap people on the shoulder 
and kind of joke with them, 
whereas Obama was more 
like back with the message. 
But, I think it is always really 
insightful when you have such 
a public figure who is so close 
to the presidency physically 
here in Ann Arbor.”

Business 
junior 
Abhi 

Muchhal also attended Baker’s 
talk and was struck by Baker’s 
observations of how hallmark 
issues unfolded within the 
Obama administration.

“I 
think 
it 
was 
really 

interesting how when you 
first read news stories, they 
are often polarized in one 

direction or the other and 
his perspective taking a lot 
of the moments in Obama’s 
history 
was 
talking 
about 

the nuance,” Muchhal said. 
“How some people thought 
about it this way, some people 
thought about this way and 
how Obama ended up deciding 
it. So it was an interesting way 
to think about Obama’s legacy 
even though it has only been a 
couple years.”

During 
the 
question 

and 
answer 
period, 
many 

audience members echoed the 
sentiment of Li and Muchhal 
and expressed a desire to 
hear more of Baker’s own 
perspective on the issues that 
defined the eight years of 
the 
Obama 
administration. 

However, Baker was quick 
to point out his job is not 
to insert his own opinions. 
Baker’s talk was a collection 
of observations and an attempt 
to forecast how Obama will be 
remembered in history. 

“He is a very disciplined 

guy, and I think we saw that,” 
Baker said. “But, because of 
that, we didn’t necessarily 
always, you know, see the 
world through his eyes. We 
weren’t always sure you know 
what he was thinking or where 
he was going … Obama will 
occupy an important place 
in our history, we just don’t 
know what it will be exactly 
and that is what makes him so 
interesting.”

new modular cabins would 
be 300 square feet each and 
include a sleeping and living 
area and a bathroom with a 
shower.

The 
Johnston 
Hall 

recreational 
facility, 
which 

was destroyed by a tree during 
a storm, would be replaced 
and feature open recreational 
space, 
restrooms 
and 
a 

laundry room. The proposal 
includes 
required 
upgrades 

to the electrical, water supply 
and septic systems as well. If 
approved, the funding for the 
project would come from LSA.

LSA 
freshman 
Kirsten 

Nelson, 
a 
Camp 
Davis 

participant, said while she 
hopes a couple of cabins are 
preserved for their historical 
value, they are definitely in 
need of repair.

“I heard about the possible 

cabin renovations before I 
went out west and I was glad 
I would get to stay in the neat 
old cabins,” she said. “I love 
‘roughing it’ while camping 
but I was surprised to see that 
my cabin had cracks going 
across the entire floor with 

a hole in the middle. A few 
days I moved in, a chizzler dug 
himself up through this hole 
and into my cabin. Although 
the cabins did not ruin my 

experience by any means, I 
would say that it is time for an 
upgrade. I think a few of the 

old cabins should stay at Camp 
Davis for historical value, but I 
definitely support the plan for 
new cabins.”

Echoing Nelson’s tone of 

appreciation for the cabin’s 
rustic 
nature, 
LSA 
junior 

Kyle Doroudian said he has 
sentimental 
memories 
of 

battling the cold and wildlife 
in his living quarters.

“The cabins were a lot of fun 

unless you don’t like the cold 
or are afraid of mice,” he said. 
“I’m sure if you’d asked me this 
question two summers ago, 
I would’ve had a lot stronger 
feelings about it but it’s sort of 
a fond memory for me now, as 
in it was part of the experience 
out there.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Bailey 

Delehant, who will attend 
Camp Davis this summer, said 
she feels comforted knowing 
the University is putting effort 
into maintaining the quality of 
the camp accommodations.

“I’m really happy to see that 

the UM cares just as much 
about updating Camp Davis 
as it does for the Ann Arbor 
campus. I think the people that 
work there and the students 
that attend care about the 
program a lot, and it makes me 
happy to know that the school 
cares just as much.”

Wildfire’s 
email 
utilized 

an old University logo and 
welcomed students back to the 
University after winter break, 
using language such as ‘We’re 
thrilled to have you back 
Wolverines!’ The subject of the 
email was ‘Wildfire App U-M’ 
and the email address was 
seemingly chosen to mimic 
those of the University.

School 
of 
Information 

assistant 
professor 
Florian 

Schaub explained companies 
can find email addresses to 
send 
marketing 
materials 

to through various means, 
including 
targeting 

institutions and paying third 
party websites to release data.

“They try to find ways to 

figure out email addresses,” 
Schaub said. “For example we 
have MCommunity, which is 
a public portal and you can 
search for people and see their 
email 
addresses 
and 
their 

contact information.”

This 
brings 
up 
another 

salient concern on campus 
of internet privacy. As the 
University 
is 
increasingly 

reliant on the internet, more 
and more personal information 
is being uploaded for anyone 
to find. To highlight these 
emerging issues, the School of 
Information and the Office of 
Information Assurance held 
the 
first 
annual 
Privacy@

Michigan symposium at the 
end of January to call attention 
to internet data privacy. Schaub 
spoke at the event and gave 
audience members strategies to 

help them make good internet 
privacy decisions.

As 
for 
situations 
like 

the 
Wildfire 
one, 
where 

information — like an email 
address — has already been 
gathered, 
Schaub 
suggests 

email users be careful when 
coming across an unexpected 
email. 
Overall, 
Schaub 

emphasized that users should 
be suspicious whenever they 
are accessing a link, website or 
application, and urged them to 
read the company’s data policy.

“When I’m signing up for 

a service or a mobile app, (I 
ask) what are they allowed 
to do with my data,” Schaub 
said. “Whenever you use an 
email address you need to be 
really cautious and think about 
who they are sharing this data 
with.”

Dana Fair, the University 

Information and Technology 
Services 
senior 
marketing 

communications 
specialist, 

confirmed Wildfire was not 
affiliated with the University. 
However, Fair explained in an 
email interview Wildfire was 
just a marketing email and not 
malicious software.

“Receiving 
emails 
from 

entities outside the institution 
does not suggest that U-M 
email addresses or the privacy 
of 
individuals 
have 
been 

compromised,” he wrote.

In an email, Interim U-M 

Chief 
Information 
Security 

Officer Sol Bermann echoed 
Fair’s 
statements 
and 

maintained while marketing 
emails may be ‘junk’ and seen 
as annoying, there is little 
that can be done to prevent 
unsolicited 
emails 
from 

entering any inbox.

“The University community, 

myself 
included, 
often 

receives unsolicited marketing 

emails,” Bermann said. “This 
is not much different than 
unsolicited email you get in 
other email accounts you may 
have, and it can certainly be a 
nuisance.”

Many 
email 
accounts, 

whether 
through 
the 

University or personal, are 
subjected to marketing emails. 
However, Wildfire concerns 
some because the application 
claims to provide students 
with safety alerts, similar to 
the emergency alerts which 
the 
University 
Division 
of 

Public Safety and Security 
sends. Having an application 
that is not affiliated with 
the University advertise to 
students 
they 
can 
provide 

emergency 
notifications 

about 
matters 
concerning 

campus safety and security 
may potentially conflict with 
reliable information coming to 
and from DPSS.

DPSS currently sends safety 

and 
crime 
alerts 
through 

multiple channels, such as 
the Michigan App and the 
newly released DPSS App. In 
addition, students and faculty 
can sign up to receive text 
message alerts in the event of 
an emergency.

DPSS 
Associate 
Director 

Melissa Overton said while 
DPSS 
has 
not 
evaluated 

Wildfire, the Michigan and 
DPSS apps are the only alert 
systems 
they 
approve 
of 

because of their reliability.

“We continue to promote the 

Michigan and DPSS apps for 
accurate alert information,” 
she said.

As 
of 
Tuesday 

representatives for Wildfire 
have not responded to requests 
for comment. A link to the 
developer’s website on the 
Apple App Store leads to an 

error message.

LSA sophomore Sean Yoon 

shared 
his 
concern 
that 

Wildfire, an application not 
approved by the University, 
might 
provide 
students 

and faculty with unreliable 
information and sources.

“I definitely think reliability 

comes really important when it 
comes to this issue,” Yoon said. 
“We know DPSS (alerts) are 
credible and they are related 
to the University and they are 
giving us credible information, 
whereas this one we don’t 
know if they are credible or 
not.”

LSA 
junior 
Evelyn 
Kim 

shared Yoon’s concerns about 
the reliability of Wildfire but 
saw some potential benefit 
in having a student-reported 
communication 
app, 
as 

Wildfire depends on students 
to report incidents in a social-
media type platform.

“I think that if there are 

people who are saying they 
witnessed something, that can 
actually help the investigation 
of the case — I think that’s 
actually a helpful side of 
Wildfire,” Kim said. “(But) 
that application should require 
people to at least provide 
their phone numbers so that 
they can provide some critical 
information there.”

However, Yoon and Kim both 

agreed the marketing of the 
application in the email sent 
to students was deceitful and 
problematic because Wildfire 
misrepresented themselves to 
the community as a University-
sanctioned 
application 
for 

campus safety information.

“The fact that they even used 

the logo for the University of 
Michigan is a problem in the 
first place,” Yoon said.

USA’s core beliefs and his own 
“conservatarian” 
political 

philosophy. He then addressed 
the idea of ideological diversity 
by discussing the future of 
U.S. politics and emphasizing 
the need to challenge the rise 
of leftist ideals on college 
campuses.

Kirk repeatedly expressed 

his disagreement with what he 
calls socialist or neo-Marxist 
ideology, describing socialism 
as 
“the 
greatest 
killer 
of 

humanity in the last 100 years 
and the worst idea of the 20th 
century.”

“It baffles me, the rise 

of 
socialism 
on 
college 

campuses,” Kirk said.

Kirk’s speech touched on 

a variety of other subjects, 
including 
the 
Boycott, 

Divestment 
and 
Sanctions 

movement, 
which 
pushes 

for divestment from Israel. 
A 
#UMDivest 
resolution 

successfully passed in Central 
Student 
Government 
last 

November, for the first time 
on the Ann Arbor campus. The 
resolution 
urges 
University 

Board of Regents to form a 
committee to investigate three 

companies operating in Israel 
with alleged human rights 
violations against Palestinians. 

Kirk condemned the BDS 

movement 
as 
anti-Semitic 

and said, “Israel is a beacon of 
freedom in the Middle East.”

Among 
the 
other 
topics 

Kirk discussed were political 
philosophy, 
human 
nature, 

religion and biases in the 
media.

After speaking for about 40 

minutes, Kirk opened the floor 
up to questions. Participants 
asked Kirk for his opinion 
on a range of issues such as 
President 
Donald 
Trump, 

institutionalized 
oppression, 

regulating large corporations 
and identity politics.

He also responded to several 

questions about how young 
conservatives can engage their 
liberal peers in discussions. 
Kirk encouraged the audience 
to stay “as informed as you 
possibly can, not just about 
the 
other 
viewpoint, 
but 

other foundational ideas and 
perspectives.”

Kirk responded to several 

questions 
intended 
to 

challenge 
his 
ideas. 
One 

student asked Kirk whether 
his Facebook page actually 
sparks dialogue, or whether 
it’s simply “pandering” to his 
base. Kirk said the Facebook 

page does foster conversation. 

According to Kirk, some of 

the material he puts online 
is “intentionally trying to be 
edgy, spur discussion, spur 
debate … And some of it is also, 
I think, very good intellectual 
content.”

Many 
of 
the 
students 

who attended Kirk’s speech 
were 
visiting 
from 
nearby 

universities. 
Spencer 

Edwards, 
a 
sophomore 
at 

Jackson College, came to the 
event to hear from a younger 
conservative thinker.

“I grew up on a lot of 

conservative 
ideals 
with 

my 
grandparents, 
guys 

like Michael Savage, Rush 
Limbaugh … Those are the 
guys for an older generation. I 
feel like these guys like Charlie 
are guys who represent our 
generation 
more,” 
Edwards 

said.

LSA 
freshman 
Michael 

Dedecker 
said 
he 
also 

appreciated hearing Charlie 
Kirk 
speak, 
especially 
in 

relation 
to 
his 
humorous 

retorts against liberal ideals.

“I’m probably going to start 

following him around more on 
Twitter, just because I thought 
he was funny and he offered 
some new perspectives on how 
to combat socialism with new 
arguments,” he said.

L

ast week, the Latinx Alliance for Community Action, Support 
and Advocacy sent a list of demands to administrators 
detailing where the University of Michigan needs to increase 

their support for the Latinx community. As the national political 
climate becomes more hostile toward Latinx communities and 
incidents of hostility toward the Latinx community on campus 
continue, the University needs to live up to their values of diversity 
and inclusion to ensure that Latinx students and faculty are 
supported on campus. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board stands 
in solidarity with La Casa as they seek action on these demands, 
and calls on the administration to listen to them. Recognizing and 
acting on the barriers Latinx students and faculty face will not only 
help the Latinx community, but also have effects that reverberate 
throughout the campus when it comes to diversity. 

W

here were you when 
you found out Kylie 
Jenner had her baby?

I was on a bus full of middle 

schoolers, on our way back 
from a winter retreat I led. 
For a moment, I lost sight of 
any responsibility I had to be a 
mature, positive role model and 
squealed, “Guys! Kylie Jenner 
had her baby!” Cue the madness.

For the uninitiated, Kylie 

Jenner’s original claim to fame 
was being the youngest star of 
the reality TV show, “Keeping 
Up With The Kardashians,” 
which premiered when she was 
only 9 years old. Jenner is the 
daughter of Kris Jenner and 
Olympian Caitlyn Jenner and 
half-sister of Kim Kardashian 
West. At 20 years old, Jenner 
is known for her lip injections, 
rapper boyfriends and alarming 
rate at which she posts pictures 
of herself on social media. In 
September, rumors began to 
circulate that she was pregnant 
— a theory that Jenner herself 
did not confirm until Feb. 4, four 
days after the baby was born.

The socially accepted view 

of Jenner is that she is a vapid, 
tasteless reality star without 
any real talent to account for her 
millions of teen superfans. When 
I ask someone whether he or she 
has heard about Jenner’s baby, 
the most common response is, 
“Why do you even care?”

To which I respond: “Why 

don’t you?”

The key to success in our 

world right now is appealing 
to 
millennials. 
Companies 

are 
drastically 
changing 

their office culture to recruit 
millennial employees. Chains 
like Applebees and TGI Fridays 
are suffering thanks to their 
inability to attract millennial 
customers. During her 2016 
presidential campaign, Hillary 
Clinton infamously tried to win 
over millennial voters by saying, 
“I’m trying to figure out how we 
get them to have Pokemon Go to 
the polls.”

Further, in a world that is 

increasingly dominated by social 
media, an inability to advertise 
effectively 
on 
social 
media 

platforms is a serious liability for 

any business or political figure. 
The 2008 presidential election 
is often called the Facebook 
election, as analysts cite Barack 
Obama’s strong social media 
presence as an asset over his 
opponents. 
Seemingly 
every 

brand, nonprofit, political figure 
and social movement is spending 
a huge portion of time and 
resources to attract views on its 
social media profile.

And, yet, the most-liked 

photo on Instagram isn’t any 
of those things. The most-
liked photo on Instagram is the 
photo in which Kylie Jenner 
announces that her daughter is 
named Stormi.

That photo has over a million 

likes. For someone with no 
talent, clearly, Jenner is doing 
something right.

Attracting 
Instagram 

likes 
isn’t 
Jenner’s 
only 

accomplishment. In 2015, she 
created a cosmetics startup, 
Kylie Cosmetics, which earned 
her $8.7 million in its first year 
alone. Jenner serves as founder 
and CEO of Kylie Cosmetics, 
as well as chief marketing 
officer and chief creative officer 
(Her mother, Kris Jenner, is 
the company’s chief financial 
officer). 
Kylie 
Cosmetics 
is 

predicted to take in $1 billion in 
lifetime sales by 2022.

In addition, Jenner earns 

money from her endorsement 
deals with PacSun and Puma. She 
is estimated to earn $200,000 
per post on Instagram, and her 
Snapchat was the most-viewed 
account of 2016. In 2017, at age 
19, Jenner was listed on Forbes 
30 Under 30 for her position 
as founder of Kylie Cosmetics. 
She also became the youngest 
celebrity on Forbes 100, having 
earned $41 million that year.

I can think of plenty of 

people who don’t have any talent 
and also aren’t Forbes 30 Under 
30 entrepreneurs.

Though 
Jenner’s 
position 

as the sister of a reality TV 
star certainly didn’t hurt her 
business, that alone doesn’t 
account for her astronomical 
success. There are countless 
celebrities on television, many of 
whom reach way more viewers 

than Jenner. In fact, KUWTK 
is only the 386th most popular 
show on television. If the stars 
of those shows have way more 
viewers, why aren’t they able to 
build the fanbase that Jenner has 
built? Jenner, more than anyone 
else in the world, has proven 
to have the business savvy to 
leverage her position as the sister 
of a reality TV star to become 
one of the most successful 
businesswomen in the world.

In fact, even though all of the 

Kardashian and Jenner sisters 
were effectively given the same 
platform and celebrity status, 
only the youngest Jenner figured 
out how to monetize it to the 
extent of which she did. Jenner 
is now worth more than all of her 
sisters combined. (Her sisters, in 
case you’ve forgotten, include 
Kim Kardashian West and model 
Kendall Jenner.)

Jenner may appear to lack 

any sort of substance or depth, 
but 
underneath 
the 
heavy 

makeup and Instagram filters, 
every selfie is a researched, 
calculated 
business 
decision. 

She has the millennial consumer 
segment under lock and key. So 
if you didn’t care that Jenner 
had a baby, perhaps you should 
reevaluate. Or at least spend 
some time analyzing why this 
20-year-old sister of a reality 
TV star could draw in over a 
million likes on her baby name 
announcement, but brands like 
Chili’s, which has an entire 
marketing 
department 
that 

likely 
focuses 
on 
attracting 

millennials, can’t even draw in 
500k followers on Twitter.

“I really do feel like people 

don’t take me seriously as a 
businesswoman because of my 
age and my reputation,” Jenner 
said on her TV show “Life of 
Kylie”, which premiered after 
the massive success of her 
cosmetics brand. “But I feel like 
they’re starting to. I like to prove 
people wrong.”

Politicians and business people 

alike should be asking themselves 
this $41 million question: What can 
I learn from Kylie Jenner?

The 
recent 
campus 

climate survey conducted by 
the Office of Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion found Latinx 
students are 132 percent more 
likely to feel discrimination than 
their white peers. Along with 
this feeling, the proportion of 
Latinx students at the University 
is rising: 7.33 percent of the 2017 
freshman class identified as 
Hispanic while 6.67 percent of 
the student body as a whole was 
comprised of Hispanic students.

Yet, 
the 
University 

has 
not 
kept 
pace 
with 

supporting Latinx students. 
Specifically, La Casa takes 
issue with the few Latinx 
faculty members hired at 
the University in addition 
to the lack of Latinx studies 
faculty at the University and 
the 
subsequent 
increased 

workload 
that 
falls 
on 

them as they must support 
students and engage in their 
own scholarship. The lack of 
community-focused 
faculty 

members in a time where 
the Latinx community is 
increasingly 
important 
to 

our nation’s political rhetoric 
sends a message that the 
community is of little interest 
to the University, even as it 
tries to prioritize diversity, 
equity and inclusion. The 
additional steps demanded, 
including the creation of 
a 
presidential 
advisory 

committee, 
are 
relatively 

simple, tangible actions that 
can be taken to demonstrate 
the importance of the Latinx 
community at the University 
and give them space for 
dialogue and representation.

The University also has a 

commitment to its students 
to make sure they feel safe 
and 
supported 
in 
their 

academic community. One of 
the major advertising points 
of 
the 
University 
is 
the 

diverse campus atmosphere. 
However, the school needs 
to realize there are unique 

communities 
beneath 
the 

umbrella 
term 
“diverse,” 

each with their own wants 
and needs. With increased 
animosity 
towards 
Latinx 

communities 
around 
the 

nation, it becomes even more 
necessary for the University 
to create spaces of safety 
where students and faculty 
alike can learn about the 
barriers that Latinx students 
face here at the school and 
work with the University to 
take concrete action to break 
them down.

As 
the 
nation 
pushes 

forward 
with 
the 
debate 

over the Latinx community, 
the 
University 
needs 
to 

support its own population 
and take substantial action 
in championing their Latinx 
students and staff. The first 
steps the University should 
take are enacting the demands 
of La Casa and continuing to 
listen to the group, should 
more issues arise.

Support La Casa’s demands

L

ast week, Nancy Pelosi 
set a record. Speaking on 
the floor of the House of 

Representatives, she stretched her 
so-called “magic minute” privilege 
as Minority Leader into an eight-
hour defense of the DREAMers. 
This came in response to Senate 
Democrats agreeing to a budget 
deal that would have left millions 
of 
undocumented 
immigrants 

without protection. She shattered a 
record that was set in 1909, telling 
DREAMers’ stories and taking a 
stand for one of the causes that 
progressives 
have 
consistently 

rallied around in the Trump era. 
What’s more, she did this in four-
inch heels. So where is Nancy 
Pelosi’s “yass queen” moment?

On paper, she should be the 

toast of progressives and liberal 
Democrats 
everywhere. 
Pelosi 

was the first and only woman to 
serve as Speaker of the House, 
helped found the Congressional 
Progressive Caucus, opposed the 
Iraq War, has been a strong ally 
to the LGBT community since 
the 90’s, and holds a strong pro-
choice record. She pushed through, 
against all odds, the Lily Ledbetter 
Fair Pay Act and Obamacare. As 
Speaker, she once removed a statue 
of Robert E. Lee from the Capitol 
and replaced it with Rosa Parks. 
In 2017, she raised $50 million for 
Democratic candidates to take 
back the House next November.

So why is she so unpopular, even 

among Democrats? Candidates 
routinely dodge questions about 
whether or not they would vote 
for her to remain as leader. Several 
younger Democrats blamed her 
for her role in Jon Ossoff’s loss in 
the Georgia 6th special election 
last year. She has shockingly low 
approval ratings (only 29 percent 
view 
her 
favorably, 
while 
a 

whopping 50 percent disapprove) 
and is the subject of substantial 
derision in her own party.

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) 

made waves last summer when she 
repeated the phrase “reclaiming 
my time” over and over again 
during a hearing for now Treasury 
Secretary Steve Mnuchin. The 

Internet celebrated her and she 
was dubbed by many “Auntie 
Maxine.” Where is this treatment 
for Pelosi? Granted, she did receive 
some applause from her fellow 
House Democrats when her speech 
concluded and a positive write-
up in The Washington Post, but 
whatever good will Pelosi earned 
from this will be temporary at best.

There are, of course, probably 

dozens of explanations for this 
inconsistency. There is always 
inherent 
hostility 
towards 

members of party leadership and 
authority figures — especially 
those who have held their posts 
for as long as Pelosi has. She gave 
a tone-deaf answer last November, 
calling for due process for John 
Conyers after sexual harassment 
charges were leveled against him 
(though she quickly turned around 
and called for his resignation). She 
is one of the wealthiest members 
of Congress. She was a driving 
force behind Hillary Clinton’s 
2016 campaign. Her unpopularity, 
though, may be attributed to, 
more than anything else, a streak 
of latent, subtle sexism that is 
festering in the Democratic Party 
in 2018.

Think about some of the most 

popular figures right now in the 
party. Bernie Sanders, Barack 
Obama and Joe Biden — all men. 
Nancy Pelosi is viewed to be out of 
touch and shrill. No one can seem to 
stop taking hits at Hillary Clinton, 
despite the fact that it has been a 
full 15 months since the election. 
People knock Elizabeth Warren 
for her claims of Native American 
ancestry and Kamala Harris for 
her inexperience.

These 
attacks 
are 
usually 

carried out under the guise of some 
sort of woke, progressive purity. 
Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders is still 
way out of step with the average 
Democrat on gun control. Barack 
Obama expanded the U.S. drone 
program beyond what any liberal 
would have thought appropriate. 
Joe Biden plagiarized speeches. 
Men, it seems, are afforded mistakes 
and forgiven. Once again, women 
are being held to an unrealistic 

standard, just a few ticks above their 
male counterparts. In this instance, 
though, it is being done by the party 
that claims to advocate for and 
empower women.

Given the current state of the 

GOP as a party that is inherently 
hostile towards women, Democrats 
should be celebrating its female 
leadership, rather than subjecting 
it to the same nonsense that they 
experience on the other side of the 
aisle. One recent ranking of the 
top fifteen potential democratic 
andidates for 2020 included only 
four women total, with just one of 
those in the top five contenders (in 
fourth). The relatively unknown 
Sen. Chris Murphy (CT) was 
ranked higher than Elizabeth 
Warren and California Governor 
Jerry Brown (who would be 82 
on Election Day) was listed above 
two qualified, popular, sitting 
senators in Kamala Harris and 
Kirsten Gillibrand.

Of course, it is possible that 

these preferences are entirely 
incidental; that, somehow, the 
women in leadership roles in the 
Democratic Party are out of touch 
and inexperienced compared to 
their male counterparts. Nancy 
Pelosi may be a beltway insider 
who no longer has a place in 
the party. Male candidates may 
simply be better suited to lead the 
party against Trump in 2020.

To 
accept 
all 
of 
these 

possibilities, though, takes quite 
a bit of mental gymnastics and 
ignores the much more likely 
common denominator. In fact, 
speaking as a progressive, I accept 
exactly zero of those explanations.

Democrats 
need 
to 
very 

seriously reflect on how they 
respond to women who take on 
leadership roles within the party. 
Is it possible that sexism is still 
alive and well, perhaps even on the 
rise? If not, great—but there is still 
a lot to explain to Nancy Pelosi and 
the host of qualified Democratic 
women with their eye on 2020.

I once heard someone describe 
the soil in Hollywood as being 
poisoned, the idea being that the 
foundations of the industry itself 
were so toxic that nothing but toxic 
fruit could grow there. Poison fruit 
doesn’t always know it’s poison 
fruit. Such is the case with Quentin 
Tarantino. 
In an ideal world, I would 
never hear, say or think the words 
“Quentin Tarantino,” but I am a 
film major in 2018 with Internet 
access. So, here we are. 
By now, we all know what the 
film-boy-fan-favorite 
put 
Uma 
Thurman through on the set of 
“Kill Bill.” Thurman broke her 
silence on Weinstein and his 
frequent collaborator via Maureen 
Dowd’s melodramatic New York 
Times profile. I could — for much 
longer than this column — pick 
apart the ways in which that piece 
does not do justice to the story 
Thurman has to tell. But that is 
someone else’s job.
If you weed through the white 
wine and the burning pizza boxes 
(details that in any other context 
would make me giddy), the facts 
of Thurman’s story expand the 
narrative that has already been 
set in motion by the #MeToo 
movement.
While working on the set of 
“Kill Bill,” Tarantino had Thurman 
operate a car she did not know how 
to drive. That alone is controlling 
and manipulative. But the event 
ended in a crash, which left 
Thurman with permanent and 
painful damage to her knees and 
neck. We’ve seen how short the 
shelf-life for a woman in Hollywood 
is. Because most women get 
pronounced dead on their 30th 
birthdays, they are treated with a 
profoundly dangerous disregard.
This 
revelation 
turns 
the 
floodlights 
on 
an 
already 
illuminated — but still willingly 
ignored — issue. Hollywood does 
not need women to be people, so 
it does not treat them as people. 
The physical and emotional safety 

of women only matters as long as 
they are a marketable product. 
And the second they no longer are, 
Hollywood has someone else lined 
up to take their place.
That’s 
why 
Tarantino 
can 
almost kill one of the greatest living 
actresses and give an “apology,” in 
which he never actually apologizes. 
It’s business as usual.
The problem with Hollywood 
is serial abusers and monsters 
like Weinstein. But the problem 

with Hollywood is also people 
like Tarantino who have adapted 
to that world without question, 
who learned the rules and played 
by them without question or 
hesitation.
That’s why it makes sense that 
this is the moment that Tarantino’s 
disgusting 
defense 
of 
Roman 
Polanski 
has 
resurfaced. 
His 
apology for this one is slightly more 
convincing, but does not in any 
way remove him from a crumbling 
institution 
of 
Hollywood 
masculinity. 
His 
defense 
of 
Polanski isn’t surprising because 
it echoes the weak defenses 
people like Diane Keaton and Alec 
Baldwin have given for Woody 
Allen.
Because defending these men 
isn’t just about upholding their 
character — it’s about upholding a 
system that allowed these people 
to succeed. Tarantino’s success in 
Hollywood depended on bad and 
powerful men. The industry that 
their toxicity created worked for 
him. Tarantino can see this world 
is (finally) dying and he’s flailing.

Tarantino’s love affair with 
the Hollywood culture of the 
Miramax/Weinstein company era 
shouldn’t come as a surprise. His 
films give us the clearest clues as to 
his internalization of the toxicity of 
that culture. How deep the poison 
has seeped, you could say.
There’s a myth that Tarantino’s 
films are “feminist” or in any way 
“pro-women.” It’s a myth. They’re 
not. Not only because they were 
made with a violent disregard for 
the safety and well-being of the 
women who were integral to their 
creation. The picture they paint 
of “strong,” “liberated” women is 
one rooted in violent male fantasy. 
Women — much like Thurman’s 
character in “Kill Bill” — are 
brutalized by men until they break. 
Only from that brokenness are 
they allowed to rise, an ascent 
(if you can ever call it that) that 
hinges on violent retribution. 
It’s 
momentarily 
satisfying, 
but thematically empty. These 
aren’t characters. These aren’t 
real people. They’re vehicles for 
Tarantino’s stylistic vision.
Just like Uma Thurman was a 
vehicle for his narrative. Just like 
countless women in the industry 
were means to some man’s end. 
Tarantino 
epitomizes 
a 
toxic 
moment in film culture. Every 
movie he made and every piece 
of information I learn about him 
further underscores this point.
But hopefully, that world is 
dying. And hopefully, Tarantino 
dies with it. The success of a 
movement like #MeToo is going 
to lie in the excavation of people 
like Tarantino whose offenses 
aren’t strictly criminal. Tarantino’s 
not going to jail for anything we 
currently know about, but he is 
actively upholding a version of 
Hollywood whose lifeblood is the 
exploitation and manipulation of 
women. Jailing the Weinsteins of 
the world only does so much when 
the Tarantinos walk free.
It’s the end of an era. See you in 
hell, Tarantino.

There’s poison in the soil

MADELEINE 
GAUDIN

Think back to your middle 
school memories of summer. If 
your early teenage experience 
was anything like mine, you spent 
a lot of time meandering between 
different friend groups, arguing 
with your siblings and sometimes 
babysitting them, watching TV 
and wandering around the streets 
of your hometown. There’s a lot of 
free time in the average 14-year-
old’s summer, when you’re stuck 
between not having to go to 
school and being too young (in 
most places) to get a job.
Timmy Reed’s “Kill Me Now” 
captures the feeling of a teenage 
summer more thoroughly and 
successfully than many other 
novels in its genre — and there are 
a lot. The coming-of-age story is 
one of the most popular narratives 
out there, and understandably 
so: In trying to capture the 
complicated transition between 
childhood and adulthood, one 
can’t help but bring a ton of other 
emotions and relationships into 
the fold. It’s fascinating to think 
about the changes that happen to 
people during their lives, because 
these changes are what expose us 
for who we really are.
Part of what makes “Kill Me 
Now” work so well is its epistolary 
format. The book functions as the 
summer journal of Miles Lover, 
a 14-year-old skateboarder who 
lives in Baltimore. We learn about 
Miles the same way we would 
learn about any kid based on their 
journal: in bits and pieces. One 
entry will be about his parents, 
who are frequently fighting, and 
between whose houses Miles 
is constantly on the move. The 
next will be about a nature 
documentary Miles was recently 
watching, or just a thought he’d 
been holding in his head. He 
writes down what he does when 
he’s all by himself, what he thinks 
about his identical twin sisters, 
what his earliest memory is. 
And it’s through these random, 

disjointed musings that we come 
to understand him, as a narrator 
and as a person.
On the one hand, the journal 
entries (which aren’t even dated) 
do lend the book kind of a plotless, 
meandering feel at times. But the 
book isn’t presented as anything 
other 
than 
a 
journal, 
and 
ultimately, the lack of a discernible 
plot is a big part of what makes the 
story so convincing. Even though 
nothing is outright announced 
to us, we are able to track Miles 
through 
several 
understated 

journeys: A fight with his mother 
that he can’t figure out how to 
resolve, a hatred of his younger 
neighbor that ends up becoming 
a friendship and — perhaps most 
prominently — a kinship that 
develops between Miles and his 
elderly neighbor, Mister Reese.
If this book is an immersive 
plunge 
into 
the 
realistic 
adventures 
and 
musings 
of 
a 
teenager, 
Mister 
Reese’s 
character feels like the one 
element that might be just slightly 
too farfetched to be believed. He 
fits a little bit too snugly into the 
“relatable old man who casually 
teaches valuable life lessons to a 
punkish teenage kid” archetype. 
That being said, he is made 
relatable through his dialogue, his 
relationship with Miles (which 
starts out business-focused, with 
Miles regularly selling him weed) 
and above all, the specificity of his 
actions.
The precision in this book 
is ultimately a big part of what 
makes it stand out. Miles takes 
care to describe not only the 
picture-filled interior of Mister 
Reese’s 
home, 
but 
also 
the 
chlorine blue of the nearby pool, 
the sight of ants crawling in 

melted ice cream, the darkness 
of the cemetery where his sisters 
abandon him during Hide and 
Go Seek Flashlight Tag. He goes 
to special lengths to call out 
Baltimore landmarks on nearly 
every other page — his friends live 
“over in Towson” or “in Owings 
Mills,” he goes skating in Fells 
Point and Homeland — which 
makes for a vivid setting that 
undoubtedly comes from Reed’s 
own 
Baltimore 
upbringing. 
What’s 
more, 
Miles 
usually 
balances out his keen descriptions 
with some understated thought 
about the world around him, or 
himself as a person.
A 
believable 
teenager, 
he 
does this all offhandedly, and he 
usually plays off any really deep 
observations by making a joke 
or saying something superficial 
right afterward. But through 
his consistent voice, he reveals 
himself time and time again as 
an 
observant, 
compassionate 
person who, despite appearances, 
really cares about the world 
around him. He takes a particular 
interest in animals of all kinds, 
and thinks hard about his family 
members’ happiness even after 
yelling at them in real life.
Reed’s crowning achievement 
in “Kill Me Now” may be 
his ability to offer a three-
dimensional picture of Miles’s 
world using only journal entries. 
He is aware of the dilemma that 
the format presents — the fact 
that we’re only getting Miles’s 
perspective of events after the 
fact, and that this might not 
be entirely objective — but he 
manages to twist that dilemma 
so that, in the end, it works more 
as an advantage. You can’t help 
but believe that you’re reading 
the journal of Miles Lover, a real 
teenage kid who smokes weed and 
has crushes on girls and hangs 
out in the now-vacant house that 
used to be his childhood home. 
And even though Miles isn’t real 
and the journal is a novel, it still 
feels like you’ve come to know 
somebody a little better by the 
time you finish reading it.

“Kill Me Now”

BOOK REVIEW

Fred Armisen’s stamp on the 
comedy world is well-established 
by now. Known for his quirky 
sketches depicting life in the 
titular city in “Portlandia” and 
as a mainstay on “Saturday Night 
Live,” his brand of irreverent, 
observational humor has become 
iconic. His new Netflix special 
“Standup 
for 
Drummers” 
is 
a 
creative 
but 
uneven distillation 
of his unique style.
Immediately, 
it 
is 
apparent 
that the title is 
literal. 
Armisen 
appears on a stage 
littered 
with 
drum kits of different formats 
and 
configurations. 
A 
large 
portion of the show is devoted 
to tirades against a wide variety 
of “drummers only” topics, from 
snare placement to the banter 
and 
conflicts 
between 
band 
members. The special features 
cameos from notable drummers, 
including Green Day’s Tré Cool, 
Warpaint’s Stella Mozgawa and 
session drummer Thomas Lang 
to add to the drum cred. Although 

niche in scope, these bits are 
the 
special’s 
most 
effective 
and entertaining, as Armisen’s 
background as a drummer and 
love for the art shine through at 
every moment. He performs a 
brilliant series of impressions of 
famous drummers from Keith 
Moon to Meg White as well as a 
fascinating walkthrough of drum 
kits from the 1920s to the present 
day.
As is to be expected, Armisen’s 
standup feels more like someone 
sharing observations rather than 
a 
professional 
comedian’s 
performance. 
This 
impression 
is 
bolstered 
by 
Armisen’s 
sheer 
awkwardness, 
evident 
as 
he 
fumbles 
and 
stumbles 
around 
the 
stage 
and uses a vocal delivery that 
resembles the tone you use when 
having uncomfortably personal 
late-night conversations with a 
close friend. When not riffing 
on a drumming tidbit, Armisen 
simply traverses through a series 
of short vignettes that each 
depict a certain topic, usually 
about simple observations or 
annoyances in his daily life. 
These sometimes involve music, 

such as one bit about tuning out 
while listening to jazz, while 
others seem to come out of 
nowhere, including a hilarious 
impression of a decaying fox.
For the most part, the content 
not related to drums is hit-or-
miss. A lot of the tangentially 
music-related parts reach the 
highs of the drumming content, 
such as a whirlwind series of 
impressions of accents from 
nearly all 50 states, based on 
observations 
Armisen 
made 
while touring with his band. 
However, an equal number fall 
flat, drawing polite but meek 
laughs 
from 
the 
audience, 
suggesting that the special would 
benefit from a little tightening up.
Even 
people 
who 
are 
not drummers are likely to 
thoroughly 
enjoy 
Armisen’s 
exploration of drum culture and 
music in general. Enjoying the 
rest is highly dependent on one’s 
penchant for his idiosyncratic 
sense of humor, and even his 
fans 
will 
be 
disappointed 
with some of the extraneous 
material. Nonetheless, “Standup 
for Drummers” is overall an 
innovative 
and 
entertaining 
special. 
As 
long 
as 
Netflix 
continues 
to 
take 
risks 
on 
specials like it, comedy as a genre 
will continue to grow.

‘Standup for Drummers’

TV REVIEW

‘Standup for 
Drummers’

Netflix

Netflix
From Thursday, Feb. 15th to 
Sunday, Feb. 18th, the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance will 
be presenting “You For Me For 
You” at the Lydia Mendelssohn 
Theater. Written by playwright 
Mia Chung, “You For Me For 
You” explores a country that still 
remains a mystery to most of the 
world: North Korea.
“You 
For 
Me 
For 
You,” 
directed by Priscilla Lindsay, is 
a story of the attempted escape 
of two sisters from North Korea. 
The cautious older sister Minhee, 
played by SMTD sophomore 
Amanda Kuo, is deeply devoted 
to her country, despite the havoc 
the regime has wreaked on her 
life. Junhee, the ambitious and 
adventurous 
younger 
sister, 
is played by SMTD freshman 
Levana 
Wang. 
Juxtaposed 
with her sister, Junhee will do 
anything to escape her home and 
reach the outside world. When 
Junhee attempts to cross the 
North Korean border, bringing 
Minhee with her, only one sister 
successfully leaves. This sister 
reaches New York City, while the 
other is left behind. Thus begins 
the parallel stories of Minhee 
and Junhee, each discovering 
themselves 
and 
each 
other 
through 
their 
metaphysically 
intertwined journeys.
The ties between these sisters, 
and the sisterly love that they 
possess for each other, are rich 
and beautiful, as is the contrast 
between 
their 
opinions 
and 
world views.
“Junhee is becoming more 
aware of the North Korean life 
that she’s living,” said Wang. As 

Junhee learns about the twisted 
nature of the North Korean 
regime and its strict rules against 
contact with the outside world, 
she yearns to get out.
Minhee, on the other hand, 
has been hurt in a multitude of 
ways by North Korea. Despite 
this, there’s an indescribable 
force that compels her not to 
leave.
“There’s a lot of history, not 
only familial history but the 
history of her nation, that she’s 
really proud of and unable to 

leave until she has to.” said Kuo. 
Minhee is tied up in the dark 
depths of the system and is in 
denial that her country could 
wrong her, even though it has so 
many times already.
“To leave your country is a 
disgrace to your family,” Kuo 
said when describing Minhee’s 
point of view. It’s as if Minhee 
can’t stand to betray her nation 
because 
she 
doesn’t 
know 
anything else.
“You For Me For You” is set in 
modern times, and its parallels 
to 
the 
relationship 
between 
North Korea and America are 
incredibly important.

“It’s so terrifying when you 
read it on a screen,” said Kuo 
of President Trump’s current 
online exchanges with North 
Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un. 
“But it’s so important to see two 
people up there who are just as 
terrified. In fact, even more so,” 
Kuo said of the sisters.
And, that’s exactly what this 
play aims to do.
“Rather than talking about 
North Korea as something that is 
nebulous … you see a real human 
experience that is very relatable. 
You feel for the two sisters,” said 
Kuo. By humanizing Minhee and 
Junhee, Americans will be able 
to see that there’s so much more 
to North Korea than a relentless 
and authoritarian regime. There 
are real people and real emotions.
“It’s scary to see that these two 
worlds aren’t as far apart as we 
think,” said SMTD sophomore 
Mallory Avnet, when speaking 
of America and North Korea. 
Avnet plays multiple versions of a 
woman named Liz — a character 
that was born and raised in 
America 
and 
contrasts 
the 
struggle of Minhee and Junhee’s 
lives under a dictatorship. 
Above all, “You For Me For 
You” is a story about “love in a 
multitude of ways; between men 
and women, between sisters, 
family and people and their 
country,” said Wang.
There is a free reception at 
9:30 p.m. in the Michigan League 
Hussey Room following the 
opening show on Thursday night, 
sponsored by the Department of 
Theatre & Drama and the LSA 
Nam Center for Korean Studies. 
After Friday’s show, an open 
discussion will be directed by 
Mia Chung and Priscilla Lindsay 
that is free and open to the public.

‘You For Me For You’ will

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

Seven Valentine’s films for seven Valentine’s moods

Caution: If your belief in love 
is fragile, don’t watch “Blue 
Valentine” this V-Day. This self 
proclaimed “love story” is known, 
by both those who have and 
haven’t seen it, for chewing up 
hopeless romantics and spitting 
them out on the other side with a 
new meaning of “hopeless.” The 
film follows two lovers, Cindy 
(Michelle Williams, “My Week 
with Marilyn”) and Dean (Ryan 
Gosling, “La La Land”), through 
the rise of their courtship and 
the dissolution of their marriage 

— 
intercutting 
between 
the 
respective periods throughout. 
The movie thrives on the painfully 
realistic and intimate moments 
it paints between the two leads. 
When Cindy and Dean first meet, 
their love seems plucked from 
the pages of a Nicholas Sparks 
romance without the cloying 
sappiness. In contrast, the jumps 
forward in time to the worn-down 
shells of the married couple show 
the other side of the spectrum, 
portraying in painstaking detail 
what lost love looks like. What 

sets “Blue Valentine” apart from 
other sad love stories like it is the 
total lack of idealization — even 
in the honeymoon phase, Cindy 
and Dean encounter hiccups that 
are present in real relationships, 
but would be left out in other 
films. With its authentic dialogue 
and 
compelling 
storyline 
— 
with the bonus of a stellar 
soundtrack — “Blue Valentine” is a 
knockout, both cinematically and 
emotionally speaking. 
—Sofia Lynch, Daily TV/New 
Media Editor

If You’re Looking to Cry: ‘Blue Valentine’ 

“Love, Rosie” is a rom-com that 
I literally cannot stop watching, 
one that I queue up again the 
second it ends. It is a stunning and 
uniquely hilarious film following 
the lives of Rosie (Lily Collins, 
“To the Bone”) and Alex (Sam 
Claflin, “Me Before You”), best 
friends who are obviously deeply 
in love but who seem to keep 
missing each other. The chemistry 
between Collins and Claflin is 
insane — both are sincere, quirky 
and beautiful people, whose love 
comes from a place of genuine 
affection that withstands time 
and space. Their lifelong love is a 
specific kind of touching unreality 

that is perfect fodder for rom-
com obsessives. The progression 
of their relationship is long and 
gradual, but the film is fast-paced 
and incredibly sharp, keeping you 
hooked to the winding hesitations 
and near-misses of the characters. 
“Love, Rosie” leans into the 
tropes 
of 
romantic 
comedies 
without being sticky, and uses an 
unexpected brand of weird comedy 
that makes cliché scenes fun and 
hilarious — there is a surprising 
number of different wet sounds in 
this movie and I love it. The movie’s 
bright colors, punchy music and 
tight editing create a tone of bubbly 
effervescence 
characteristic 
of 

great contemporary rom-coms. 
The meandering feel of unrequited 
love is never boring or frustrating 
— rather, you can’t help but love 
two characters who are genuinely 
good people and wait through 
heartwrenching obstacles for them 
to find their way to each other. Not 
to mention both Claflin and Collins 
are literally too beautiful to look at, 
and Claflin really knows how to 
wear a chunky sweater. This movie 
falls perfectly into the subgenre of 
addicting movies that make you 
floatingly happy and crushingly 
depressed at the same time.
—Sydney Cohen, Daily Arts 
Writer

If You’re in Love with Your Best Friend: ‘Love, Rosie’ 

The Weinstein Company

“The Princess Bride” is one of 
the great love stories of the 20th 
century. No, it’s not a romance 
in the tradition of “Romeo and 
Juliet” or other more standard 
love stories. It’s a grand adventure 
filled with action, fighting, escapes, 
chases, true love and miracles. It’s 
a film that focuses on the power 
of love in all of its forms, from the 
grandfather reading the story to his 
grandson in the same way he was 
read the story when he was young, 
to the love that Inigo Montoya 
has for his big friend Fezzik, “The 
Princess Bride” is the perfect film 
to watch on Valentine’s Day — or 
really any other day.

Who can argue with Westley 
the farm boy (Cary Elwes, “The Art 
of More”) when he tells Princess 
Buttercup (Robin Wright, “House 
of Cards”) they will survive 
because “this is true love. You think 
this happens every day?” Buttercup 
believed Westley was dead for 
years and never stopped loving 
him. Westley spent the better part 
of three years at sea with pirates 
working to get back to Buttercup. 
And of course, when Westley is 
rendered (mostly) dead, it is, in 
the words of Miracle Max (Billy 
Crystal, “The Comedians”), “what 
he’s got that’s worth living for,” that 
brings him back to the land of the 

living. The answer: To love, not to 
“blave,” which as everyone knows 
means to bluff. Kill someone’s 
father in a duel? Watch out if you’ve 
got six fingers on your right hand, 
because the power of love is going 
to compel that man’s son to come 
looking for you. Is there a film that 
better encompasses our ideal of 
love than “The Princess Bride”? 
Inconceivable! If a friend, lover, 
enemy, or rodent of unusual size 
comes to you this Valentine’s Day 
asking to watch “The Princess 
Bride,” there is but one proper 
response. “As you wish.”

If You Think Love is a Fairy Tale: ‘The Princess Bride’ 

For fans of “The Office” 
or 
“The 
Mindy 
Project,” 
“The 
Giant 
Mechanical 
Man” provides a humorous, 
tender collision of these two 
beloved shows. Chris Messina 
(“Alex of Venice”) stars as 
Tim opposite Jenna Fischer 
(“Hall Pass”) as Janice in 
“The 
Giant 
Mechanical 
Man,” which was shot at the 
Detroit Zoo and premiered at 
the Tribeca Film Festival in 
2012. Tim considers himself 
a true artist, performing on 
the streets on stilts as the 
titular Giant Mechanical Man. 

When hard times hit, he takes 
a job at the zoo as a janitor. 
Janice feels purposeless in 
the world and even gets fired 
from the temp agency for 
her 
absentmindedness. 
She 
also starts to work at the zoo, 
where she and Tim form a 
friendship. Their supportive 
relationship 
and 
deep 
connection help these two lost 
souls figure out how to pursue 
their dreams and find meaning 
in their lives. Janice’s sister 
Jill (Malin Akerman, “Couples 
Retreat”) and Doug (Topher 
Grace, 
“Spider-Man 
3”), 
a 

self-absorbed self-help writer, 
offset the melancholy with 
funny caricatures of annoying 
hipsters. 
The 
chemistry 
between the leads and the 
witty script make for a great 
movie to watch on Valentine’s 
Day. Plus, the film did not get 
much commercial exposure, so 
hopefully here’s a new treat for 
rom-com lovers.

If You’re Logical About Love: ‘Giant Mechanical Man’ 

Tribeca Film Festival

“Sixteen 
Candles” 
is 
the 
quintessential 
crush-comedy 
— think romantic comedy, but 
more crushing and less romance. 
Starring the queen of ‘80s cinema, 
Molly Ringwald (“Riverdale”), as 
the fresh-faced, newly 16 Samantha 
“Sam” Baker, the John Hughes 
classic delves into the embarrassing 
and frustrating reality of teenage 
girlhood. Sam’s family forgets her 
birthday in the disorder sprung 
from her older sister Ginny’s 
approaching wedding. Meanwhile, 
Sam’s crush, the high school 
heartthrob, Jake Ryan (Michael 
Schoeffling, “Mermaids”) roams 
the halls, crushing her with every 
step he takes. And who can forget 
Sam’s dad’s iconic line: “That’s 
why they’re called crushes. If 
they didn’t hurt, they’d be called 
something else.” 

We love Sam because she is all of 
us. She is quirky and adorable and 
relatable and perfect. So why the 
hell doesn’t Jake Ryan notice her? 
Well, good news folks, he does. 
Alas, they don’t get together until 
the last minute of the movie. But 
that anticipation keeps you going. 
Jake wants Sam and Sam wants 
Jake but Sam thinks Jake is too 
good for her and Jake thinks Sam 
doesn’t even want him. Meanwhile, 
Sam’s underpants were on full 
view for the entire freshman class, 
Ginny is high on muscle relaxers, 
Farmer Ted (Anthony Michael 
Hall, “Foxcatcher”) is driving a 
Rolls Royce with a hammered 
prom queen in the front seat and 
Long Duck Dong, the exchange 
student, is stuck in a tree. But yes, 
sadly, the film promotes disastrous 
racial and gender stereotypes 

and implies all kinds of terrible 
connotations about date rape, so 
take the classic with a heavy grain 
of salt. 
Jake and Sam keep missing each 
other and it leaves you on the edge 
of your seat begging, pleading, 
hoping Jake ends the confusion 
with some large romantic gesture 
that leaves you Lloyd-Dobler-
level shook, Ferris-Bueller-level 
stunned and Judd-Nelson-fist-in-
air-level destroyed and boy does 
he deliver, in all his gorgeous glory. 
“Sixteen Candles” is the perfect 
dose of ‘80s nostalgia, so if you 
want to be literally crushed this 
Valentine’s Day, grab your finest 
acid-washed jeans, tease those 
locks and relive an era you never 
even knew.

If You’re Crushing Hard: ‘Sixteen Candles’ 

There’s a lot that goes unsaid 
in “Twilight.” Bella (Kristen 
Stewart, “Personal Shopper) and 
Edward’s 
(Robert 
Pattinson, 
“Good Time”) relationship grows 
mostly out of stolen moments: 
hands brushing under the table, 
glances across the hall, a quick 
conversation here and there. 
It’s what happens in the spaces 
between those moments that turn 
an interest into an infatuation, 
infatuation 
into 
obsession, 
obsession into love. A lot of 
people joke about “Twilight” not 
having a plot until the last 20 
minutes when the evil vampires 
come in, but I’d argue that the 
story of “Twilight” isn’t based in 

anything happening per se, but 
instead in a clear emotional arc. 
We’re following an obsession as 
it percolates in every sigh, every 
stutter and every moment of 
overly intense eye contact. All it 
takes is a look across a crowded 
cafeteria, and she’s a goner. 
There’s a lot about “Twilight” 
that’s silly and light. No comedy in 
the past 10 years can match up to 
the beautiful genius moment that 
is Kellan Lutz climbing up a tree 
as Muse’s “Supermassive Black 
Hole” plays in the background, 
but there’s something undeniably 
brilliant about the way this film 
captures the essence of teenage 
romance. 
There’s 
a 
reason 

“Twilight” 
hit 
teenage 
girls 
around the world like a freight 
train in the mid-aughts, and it’s 
because there’s a certain kind of 
recognition there. We identified 
with Bella, not just because she 
was written to be something of 
a cipher (though that’s definitely 
part of it), but because “Twilight” 
captures with near perfect clarity 
what it feels like to be a teenager 
who is obsessed. It’s been 10 years 
since the first “Twilight” was 
released, but it’s unlikely that its 
resonance will fade over time. 
Like its protagonists, “Twilight” 
will live forever.

Behind Enemy Lines: Fran McCaffrey

Iowa coach Fran McCaffery 

stepped to the podium at Big 
Ten media day and proclaimed 
this was “the deepest team 
we’ve ever had.” 

Perhaps he meant it at the 

time, but the results have hardly 
bore that out.

The 
Hawkeyes 
come 
to 

Crisler Center Wednesday at 
just 12-15 overall and 3-11 in 
Big Ten play, good for 11th in 
the conference — with no major 
role to play for 
the rest of the 
year but spoiler. 
This season will 
mark 
the 
first 

time since 2010-
11 that Iowa has 
won fewer than 
eight conference 
games.

Still, 
the 

offense 
that 

McCaffery 
praised at media 
day is still capable of bunching 
points, 
with 
guard 
Jordan 

Bohannon and forward Tyler 
Cook providing a formidable 
inside-out scoring punch.

The Daily sat down with 

McCaffery at Big Ten Media Day 
to discuss his projections for 
the season and his relationship 
with Michigan coach John 
Beilein:

The Michigan Daily: You 

lose Peter Jok, but return 77% 
of your scoring 86% of your 
minutes, do feel like you guys 
are being a little overlooked?

Fran McCaffery: It’s really 

irrelevant to me — and I mean 
that sincerely — what the 
projections are. We have a 
good team. What we have to 
do is play well, we have to play 
together. We have to play better 
defense. You can talk about that 
stuff and get hung up on it if you 
want to, but it’s a waste of time.

TMD: You’ve been high on 

your offense…

FM: We’re going to score. We 

can score.

TMD: What do you think you 

guys are doing defensively that 
can help you improve?

FM: The critical thing is 

we’ve got to be more connected. 
We weren’t connected last year 
in transition — because we’re 
going to be in transition a lot. 
We run. If you run, you’ve got 
to run back. You’ve got to get 
matched up. We really weren’t 
connected. When you play fast, 
sometimes that happens, we’ll 

just go down 
and 
score, 

start 
trading 

baskets. 
Then 

you can’t get 
the 
necessary 

stops in crunch 
time. So instead 
of 
winning 

a 
five-point 

game you lose 
a 
three-point 

game. For us, 
we have to be 

connected on the defensive end. 
That’s indicated in rebounding 
— second shots are what killed 
us. Second shots are what 
killed us. Second shots lead 
to high-percentage shots and 
uncontested 
threes, 
right? 

That’s what they lead to. Even if 
we play solid defense — not even 
great defense — but rebound the 
first miss, then 
we can run. We’ll 
be a lot better 
than last year.

TMD: 
Who 

do 
you 
think 

is 
sticking 
out 

most defensively, 
grabbing 
rebounds 
in 

practice?

FM: 
For 
us, 

it’s been a lot 
of 
different 

people. 
(Freshman 
forward 

Luka) Garza is a phenomenal 
rebounder, might be our best. 

Cook 
is 
rebounding 
better. 

(Nicholas) Baer has always 
been a good rebounder. Ahmad 
Wagner, Cordell Pemsl, those 
guys, Dom Uhl. Cordell has 
really been good.

TMD: 
How 
has 
Garza 

adjusted so far?

FM: 
Really 
good. 
Think 

about it. We go oversees and 
play four games. Ten years ago 
we weren’t allowed to bring our 
freshmen, but now we can bring 
our freshmen. We practice, 
everything’s new — how we play 
ball screens, terminology, how 
we run the break — everything’s 
new. He’s gotta pick it all up in 
a couple of weeks and then we 
go play. We play four games, he 
plays half the game. He played 
20 minutes a game four times, 
he averages 22.5 and 10.5. Those 
are staggering numbers, I don’t 
care who you’re playing against.

TMD: I read you talked to 

John Beilein about coaching 
your son...

FM: I did. More than once.
TMD: 
What 
was 
that 

conversation like?

FM: I’ve talked to him a lot 

about it. First of all, I really have 
a lot of respect for him, known 
him for a long time, got to know 
his wife. Unless you talk to 
someone who’s going through 
it — he just said, the greatest 
thing was that I got to see my 
son everyday. You take that 

for 
granted, 

unless they’re 
somewhere 
else. He said 
there 
were 

times 
when 

he 
didn’t 

play as much 
and 
it 
was 

uncomfortable, 
but 
that 
kid 

competed and 
was 
really 
a 

good player for 

them. Connor (McCaffery) will 
do the same as Patrick (Beilein) 
for me. 

Calm and confident, Lavigne provides support for Michigan in net

At the end of regulation in its 

December trip to East Lansing, 
the No. 18 Michigan hockey 
team had been blown out, 5-0. 
But this Friday proved a much 
different story.

The 
Wolverines 
left 
the 

first 60 minutes tied up at 
one, and with nothing added 
to the scoreboard by either 
team in overtime, Michigan 
and Michigan State headed to 
a shootout.

Before sophomore Hayden 

Lavigne skated back to his 
spot between the pipes, Mel 
Pearson briefly spoke to him.

“I just told him to ‘get ‘er 

done,’ ” Pearson said.

And adhering to his coach’s 

advice, the netminder did just 
that.

Fully locked in, Lavigne 

first stopped Spartans forward 
Taro 
Hirose’s 
shootout 

attempt. Then he left Mitch 
Lewandowski with the same 
fate. And to secure the extra 
Big Ten point, Lavigne finally 
shut down Patrick Khodorenko 
in conjunction with senior 
forward 
Tony 
Calderone 

knocking in the Wolverines’ 
last attempt. 

This 
performance 
was 

largely in contrast with the 
last time Lavigne played at 
Munn Ice Arena, on Dec. 8. In 
that game, after surrendering 
four goals over the first two 
periods of play, Lavigne was 
benched and his counterpart 
Jack LaFontaine was put in.

Lavigne’s 
performance 

this past Friday — where he 
allowed just one goal — was 
then matched by a nearly 
flawless showing in Detroit 
the 
following 
night. 
The 

goaltender stopped 32 pucks, 
letting just two slip by en route 
to Michigan’s 3-2 victory.

These 
big 
outings 
for 

Lavigne, 
which 
aided 
the 

Wolverines 
in 
claiming 
a 

crucial 
tie 
and 
win 
over 

Michigan State this weekend, 
are emblematic of newfound 
confidence the netminder has 
gained over the course of this 

season.

Since 
the 
beginning 
of 

January — when he was given 
the starting role — Lavigne 
has 
positioned 

himself 
both 

more decisively 
and 
with 

more 
ease, 

demonstrating 
comfort 
in 

the net. These 
qualities 
were 

not 
nearly 

as 
evident 

during the last 
series 
with 

the Spartans. And right now, 
Pearson 
believes 
Lavigne’s 

morale is at a season peak.

“His 
calmness, 
his 

confidence, he’s up on the top 

of his crease more,” Pearson 
said. “When you see him up 
on the top of the blue paint, 
and then when you see less 

movement from 
him, he’s not all 
over the place 
…. he’s playing 
and 
handling 

the puck better 
and coming out 
of the net and 
moving it.

“It’s 
a 
lot 

of those little 
things. He just 
seems 
more 

dialed in and he’s got a lot of 
confidence right now. And 
you have to earn that, it’s not 
something you can go into the 
store and buy. … And he’s done 

a good job of that.”

Confidence 
can 
manifest 

itself in different ways during 
a shootout, either positively 
or negatively, due to the way 
in which the high-pressure 
situation 
puts 
a 
spotlight 

on every move a goaltender 
makes.

For Lavigne on Friday, the 

former held true. But though 
he made it look easy, playing 
in goal during a shootout is 
anything but.

“It’s kind of a mental battle 

between who is more patient 
between the shooter and the 
goalie,” Lavigne said. “It’s 
definitely a tough situation, 
kind of 50-50 on each one. As 
long as I can out weight (the 
shooter), usually I have a good 

chance to make the save.”

There 
is 
a 
significant 

amount of strategy that goes 
into how a goaltender adjusts 
his 
positioning 

and 
degree 

of 
movement 

in 
shootout 

situations. 
Lavigne has been 
working 
on 
an 

approach 
that 

works 
well 
for 

him.

“I try and get 

out a couple feet 
above the crease 
and match his speed coming 
in so that we’re kind of coming 
back together,” Lavigne said. 
“But at the same time, it’s a 
lot of timing. If he’s shooting 

the puck, you’re still out far 
enough. But if he dekes, you 
still have enough speed to 
move laterally.”

These situations — though 

fairly rare as the Wolverines 
have seen just three — hold 
importance as they provide 
the victor with an extra Big 
Ten point. Lavigne has played 
in the net during each of these 
outings this season.

Given 
the 
high 
stakes, 

they are often replicated in 
Michigan’s practices.

“We have some shootouts 

every day before the game,” 
Pearson said. “It’s more of a 
fun shutout, not too serious. 
But there’s different drills, 
where you’ll have a break 
away type of situation, so (the 
goaltenders) see enough of 
those.”

While confidence in the 

shootouts is necessary, this 
attitude 
first 
stems 
from 

a 
goaltender’s 
confidence 

in 
regulation. 
And 
though 

strategy can get a goaltender 
so far, the key thing to keep in 
check, according to Lavigne, is 
mentality.

And with the stakes rising 

given that the Wolverines’ 
regular season is coming to 
a close, keeping mentality on 
point is more important than 
ever for Lavigne. However, the 
added pressure of a potential 
home-ice advantage in the 
Big Ten Tournament and a 
potential bid to the NCAA 
Tournament seem to be acting 
as motivators. 

“There’s 

definitely 
a 

little 
bit 
(of 

additional 
pressure), but 
at 
the 
same 

time, 
that 

makes it more 
exciting,” 
Lavigne said. 
“That’s 
why 

we 
come 
to 

play at a school 

like this, to play in these big 
games. So, with the pressure 
comes more excitement, comes 
a louder fan base, so it’s a good 
atmosphere to be around.”

Michigan looks to reverse course

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team will face its 
mirror image on Wednesday.

The 23rd-ranked Wolverines 

(9-5 
Big 
Ten, 
20-7 
overall) 

have fallen from the proverbial 
mountaintop, dropping three of 
their last four after being ranked 
as high as 13th. Minnesota (8-4, 
19-6) has done the opposite, 
winning five of its last six to insert 
itself into the NCAA Tournament 
conversation.

A 
few 
weeks 
ago, 
ESPN 

projected them as a four-seed, 
with 
home-court 
advantage 

in the first two rounds, in the 
site’s latest Bracketology, the 
Wolverines were given a nine-
seed. Their margin of error is 
slipping away and, after freshman 
forward Hailey Brown suffered a 
lower leg injury during Sunday’s 
loss at Michigan State, the picture 
looks even more bleak.

Michigan could still get in even 

if it loses the next two. It has a 
strong resume, having beaten 
then-No. 8 Ohio State on the road, 
the Big Ten is third in RPI and a 
run in the conference tournament 
would 
mitigate 
late-season 

troubles.

Or, the Wolverines could avoid 

needing to make the argument at 
all. The way to do that is simple: 
Beat the Golden Gophers.

But 
simple 

doesn’t always 
translate 
to 

easy.

Minnesota 

starts 
four 

guards, 
a 

combination 
that will force 
Michigan 
to 

switch between 
man and zone 
on 
defense. 

If 
Brown 
is 

unable to go, the Wolverines will 
likely start freshman guard Deja 
Church in her place and go man-

to-man. That would entail putting 
senior forward Jillian Dunston on 
a guard, but Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico has been unafraid 
to do that in the 
past. Dunston is 
capable in those 
situations, but a 
size 
mismatch 

could favor the 
Golden Gophers. 
If Brown plays, 
the 
Wolverines 

will start in zone, 
moving to man 
when 
Church 

is in the game. 
Either way, Michigan will shuttle 
between them depending on 
which lineup is in the game.

It 
doesn’t 
help 
that 
the 

Minnesota one of the highest-
scoring teams in the nation, 
notching 110.5 points per 100 
possessions, 
according 
to 

HerHoopStats. 
Kenisha 
Bell, 

Carlie Wagner, Destiny Pitts 
and Gadiva Hubbard — their 
four 
starting 
guards 
— 
all 

average 
double-digit 
points. 

Though defense hasn’t been 
the Wolverines’ issue of late, 
Michigan will be tested on that 
end.

The Wolverines’ best chance 

of winning on the road will be 
via shootout. Michigan scored 
below .85 points per possession 
in two of its last three games, 
accounting 
for 
its 
worst 

two 
offensive 

performances 
since a 74-49 loss 
against 
then-No. 

5 
Louisville 
in 

November. 
Not 

so coincidentally, 
the 
Wolverines 

turned it over 26 
and 23 times in 
those two games, 
respectively.

“That’s 

been 
really 
the 

problem, and we work on it,” 
Barnes Arico said after Sunday’s 
loss. “... I think, coming into the 

year, we really knew that that 
might be something that could 
be a problem for us because we 
weren’t returning a point guard. 

… When we get 
frazzled a little 
bit, when we get 
bummed, when 
it’s 
physical 
a 

little bit, we have 
turned it over. So 
it’s definitely a 
work in progress.

“I think part 

of it is, you know, 
not really having 
that true point 

guard. 
You 
know, 
Katelynn 

(Flaherty) has done a tremendous 
job for us filling that role, but 
now we’re looking at Katelynn to 
distribute, to score, to do a little 
bit of everything. So, you know, 
it’s important that somebody else 
relieves some of the pressure for 
her, which I think Deja’s doing 
and is gonna improve on. But 
she’s not completely ready yet.”

If that’s the case, Church 

has to get ready fast. Michigan 
has gone with a seven-woman 
rotation for most of the season. 
Without 
Brown, 
sophomore 

guard Akienreh Johnson will 
likely see a minutes uptick, but 
she’s been a less than reliable 
scorer this season, albeit in just 
7.5 minutes per game. Junior 
guard Nicole Munger will pick up 
some of the slack, but it’s hard for 
Flaherty to do much more than 
the 23.6 points in 36.7 minutes 
she’s averaging right now.

There’s an element to this 

game that can’t be measured with 
statistics, though. A win will seal 
the Wolverines a tournament 
berth, at least as much as a thing 
like that can be sealed.

Michigan 
has 
been 
free 

falling. The Golden Gophers are 
fast-rising. It’s crunch-time. If 
the Wolverines don’t reverse 
course, they will either back into 
the tournament by the grace of 
good luck or not get in at all.

Time to put up or shut up.

Three takeaways from Michigan’s first game against Iowa

It seems like eons ago that the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
traveled 
to 
Carver-Hawkeye 

Arena.

The Wolverines shot the lights 

out in the first half on Jan. 2 to get 
out to a huge lead against Iowa 
that they would never relinquish.

The game involved breakout 

performances on both sides of 
the court and lackluster outputs 
from typically good players that 
eventually led to Michigan’s 
75-68 victory.

The Daily breaks down what 

led to the Wolverines’ win 
and what could go wrong this 
Wednesday to flip the outcome 
when the Hawkeyes come to Ann 
Arbor.

Hot shooting 
As 
previously 
referenced, 

the Wolverines were just about 
unconscious 
in 
Iowa 
City, 

especially in the first half.

Michigan went 11-for-25 from 

beyond the arc and 8-for-15 in the 
opening 20 minutes.

The Wolverines led by as many 

as 18 points in the first half and 
had a double-digit cushion for 
over eight minutes in the period.

Even when Iowa pushed back 

at the 5:03 mark with a pair of 
Tyler Cook free throws to cut 
it to eight, Michigan quickly 
answered with a 7-0 spurt 
started by a 3-pointer from fifth-
year senior forward Duncan 
Robinson.

In all, it led to a 48-point 

first half — the third-most the 
Wolverines have scored in any 
opening period, and the most 
they’ve scored in Big Ten play.

Recently, 
Michigan 
has 

struggled 
to 
replicate 
that 

shooting. Save two good outings 
against Purdue and Sunday’s 
against Wisconsin, the Wolverine 
offense has looked far less potent 
of late.

Granted, the Hawkeye defense 

is vulnerable against opponents 
who aren’t sharpshooters — they 
have the worst scoring defense 
in the Big Ten — but if Michigan 
wants to replicate its exact 
gameplan Wednesday, it will 
have to prove Sunday’s shooting 
was not a mirage.

Livers and Simpson break 

out

The first game came at a time 

when junior forward Moritz 
Wagner 
— 
the 
Wolverines’ 

leading scorer — was hampered 
by a foot injury he suffered 
against Texas. It was clear that 
Wagner wasn’t back to his usual 
self against the Hawkeyes, as he 
scored just four points and played 
eight fewer minutes than his 

backup, sophomore Jon Teske.

In his place, Michigan enjoyed 

an even scoring output from 
redshirt 
sophomore 
forward 

Charles Matthews and senior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman. However, it also got 13 
and 15 points, respectively, from 
freshman forward Isaiah Livers 
and sophomore guard Zavier 
Simpson off the bench.

Livers 
made 
an 
impact 

immediately after stepping on 
the court. On his first play, he 
tipped a missed free throw to 
Teske, then assisted Teske for 
a mid-range jumper to tie the 
score at 10. Just over a minute 
later, he caught a lob from 
Abdur-Rahkman in transition 
and threw it down for his first 
points.

The 13 points remain Livers’ 

career high, and the performance 
was a leaping-off point that 
eventually led him to break into 
the starting lineup.

Simpson’s point total tied his 

career high too, but where he 
made his money — as he’s done 
all season — was on the defensive 
end. 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein and his staff harped on 
the Wolverines that they needed 
to stop Iowa guard Jordan 
Bohannon.

The 
sophomore 
admitted 

after the game that his coaches’ 
words motivated him to shut 
down Bohannon. The Hawkeyes’ 
second-leading 
scorer 
was 

limited to 12 points on the night 

and just three in the second half. 
Simpson was mostly responsible, 
as he played 32 minutes.

For 
him, 
too, 
the 
game 

propelled him into the starting 
lineup. In the Wolverines’ next 
game against Illinois, Simpson 
took over for freshman Eli 

Brooks at the point guard spot, a 
position he has yet to relinquish.

But 
again, 
things 
have 

changed since then. Though 
Simpson previously led Michigan 
in 3-point shooting, he hit a cold 
streak, going 1-for-15 from deep 
in the last four games.

Livers, on the other hand, 

might not even play tomorrow. 
He suffered a left ankle injury 
against Northwestern and sat 
out Sunday against the Badgers.

Beilein said in Tuesday’s press 

conference that he’s “hopeful” 
Livers will return in tomorrow’s 

game. But even if Livers does 
come back, it’s unclear in what 
capacity that will be. At any rate, 
it’s unlikely he will be able to 
perform at the same level he did 
in the first Iowa game.

Cook cooks
While 
Simpson 
did 
an 

admirable 
job 
limiting 

Bohannon, 
the 
Hawkeyes 

still found offensive success 
with forward Tyler Cook. The 
sophomore opened the game 
by putting Wagner in a blender 
with a behind-the-back dribble 
and throwing down an emphatic 
two-handed slam.

It was an accurate precursor 

for what was to come.

Cook dunked on Wagner, he 

dunked on Livers and he dunked 
on Teske en route to 28 points. 
He has become Iowa’s leading 
scorer this season, averaging 
over 15 points per game.

In January, the Wolverines 

couldn’t stop Cook. Since, they’ve 
struggled to stop multiple other 
big men in conference play, 
like Purdue’s Isaac Haas and 
Wisconsin’s Ethan Happ.

Sure, Wagner’s healthy this 

time around, but even that hasn’t 
helped 
against 
skilled 
post 

players this season.

Cook’s big night wasn’t enough 

to turn the tides in favor of the 
Hawkeyes back then, but if he 
has a similar night Wednesday, 
and Bohannon proves Beilein 
right, Michigan could have its 
hands full defensively.

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | FEBRUARY 14, 2018


O

ver the past weekend, Ann 
Arbor was hit by a heavy 8.5-
inch snowfall. Right when you 

thought it was over, the blizzard would 
start up again right where it left off, which 
makes it nearly impossible to leave the 
comfort of your slip-free, warm apartment. 
Netflix is too convenient and you settle 
for the Keurig. You convince yourself 
Swiss Miss hot chocolate will suffice. And 
naturally, trudging through the tundra 
to any crowded library or coffee shop 
becomes less and less appealing.

This week, I’ve decided to stay close to 

home, at the heart of campus.

Often overlooked for its economical 

seating and sophisticated nature, Comet 
Coffee is an Ann Arbor gem. Centrally 
located near campus, the coffee shop 
is accessible from Nickel’s Arcade. The 
hanging plaque and mint-colored table 
set completes the arcade’s picture — the 
classic barber shop, the campus florist and 
a boutique in its close vicinity. It feels like 
walking into a postcard.

Since 2009, the coffee shop has served 

drip coffee to order and prides itself on 
its quality espresso. The menu is modest. 
It’s not the place to order a customized, 
non-fat, grass-fed, gluten-free, free-range, 
sugar-free, vegan, zero calorie frappuccino 
in a hand-woven hemp sleeve — if that’s 
what you want.

But, it is the place for coffee crafted with 

care. They have an extensive selection of 
pour-overs if you like to enjoy coffee beans 
like different wines, and they have teas if 
you are on a caffeine diet. Though the food 
selection may make sticking to any other 
type of diet difficult — it’s hard to find a 
vegan chocolate chip cookie that tastes 
richer than a regular cookie with two 
sticks of butter in it.

Ahead of the curve, Comet has already 

mastered the art of making espresso drinks 
with oat milk. They are one of the only two 
places in Ann Arbor I know of that serves 
oat milk, which, in my humble opinion, is 
part of the next generation of plant-based 
products. With oat milk, you can still be 
eco-friendly and healthy, which almond 
milk won’t let you do without contributing 
to the California drought.

I am an avid Americano drinker, 

but sometimes I crave milk. Or milk-
containing hot drinks, especially when it’s 
negative-degrees Fahrenheit out and the 
streets are covered in snow. My go-to is a 
cappuccino. It seems to be the perfect ratio 
of espresso and milk for me — a latte is too 
much, a macchiato too little. If you want to 
change it up, I recommend trying Comet’s 
oat milk cappuccino with a pastry on the 
side — your body will thank you. And so 
will the environment. I don’t have any 
dietary restrictions, but I genuinely think 
it tastes better this way.

Besides the high-quality drink and 

food, the place itself is worth spending 
an afternoon. During the summer, the 
outdoor seating is a good turnaround 
point if you’re walking your dog or need 
some shade, but the winter weather calls 
for indoor warmth. I forget there’s a 
blizzard and mounds of snow on every 
other part of campus when I’m here. And 
that’s a metaphor for Comet being a haven 
from other things besides snow — the 
encroaching thesis deadline, graduation, 
life.

Comet keeps two of their four tables 

for non-laptop use. And, not surprisingly, 
the customers respect those rules. People 
come to Comet to enjoy conversation 
and company of a person or a good book. 
They also have window seating, which is 
comfortable for catching up on emails or 
writing a column. I would add watching 
lectures, but because the piped-in music 
is too good, I wouldn’t recommend 
headphones.

Today, they play all of the songs that are 

mentioned in Haruki Murakami’s book 
“Norwegian Wood.” The music, like the 
book — like the coffee, like the baristas — 
is thoughtful. Whether sitting here with a 
warm ceramic cup takes you back to Tokyo 
in the 1960s or just a break from today’s top 
hits, it’s a pleasant getaway.

I can’t help but look at the ring collection 

in the antique store across from Comet 
and imagine how old the rings are, who 
they belonged to, where they’ll go next. 
And wonder where I’ll be in a year too. 
It’s a good place for people-watching and 
making eye contact if you like having 

imaginary conversations with strangers 
like me. The pendant globe lights that 
hang in the arcade and inside Comet 
are reminiscent of a Parisian city street, 
though I can’t say for sure because I’ve 
never been.

It’s kind of a miracle that a place like this 

exists in such close proximity to campus 

buildings and Skeeps, for however much 
longer it remains. I distinctly remember 
my first time walking into Comet as a 
freshman, feeling slightly intimidated by 
its intimacy. As I sit here four years later, 
comfortable calling Ann Arbor my second 
home, I hope others get to experience the 
comfort of a place like this.

Soundtracking: Crying in Public

N

othing is simultaneously as 
embarrassing and relieving 
as letting the waterworks 

flow for the entire world to see.

Yes, I know everyone is staring and 

whispering about this grown child (I 
am in no way a grown man, so I guess 
this’ll have to do) breaking down and 
sobbing rather loudly on the fourth 
floor of the Shapiro Undergraduate 
Library. But if you think about it, it’s 
pretty beautiful that everyone trying 
to study is witnessing my cynical, 
20-year-old shell melt away.

Gross.
Sometimes it be like that. Some days 

it’s stressing about work, some days 
it’s the inner psyche knocking, some 
days it’s because I can’t find my second 
glove. Life is overwhelming sometimes 
and a good sob is some pretty solid 
medicine.

I’m not talking about crying at the 

movie theater. Everyone does that. You 
aren’t special. I cried last week while 
watching a certain movie with an 
infamous peach scene.

Visions of Gideon — Sufjan Stevens
For starters, when you expect to 

cry at a movie based on what you’ve 
already heard about it, it is a largely 
anticipated action. You prepare. You 
grab extra napkins on the way into the 
theater. You wear your fuzzy crying 
sweater (everyone has one of those, 
right?) and every fiber in your being is 
prepared. On top of the anticipation, 
many other people in the theater are 
also crying. The other sniffles give 
you solace and let you know you aren’t 
alone. The best is when one person out 
of everyone in the theater isn’t crying. 
Then they feel left out while everyone 
releases their inhibitions à la Natasha 
Bedingfield.

Get a heart, Tin Man.
While cathartic, I get much more 

satisfaction after the fact when the cry 
comes out of nowhere. It’ll suck in the 
moment but when it’s over, you walk 
forward with a new outlook on life.

And your face is squeaky clean.
I think it’s safe to say everyone at 

this University has cried in public at 
least once. If this isn’t the case, I have 
cried enough to cover at least four or 
five people bottling up their feelings. 
In the wise words of John Mulaney, 
“I’ll just keep all my emotions right 
here and then one day, I’ll die.” Stress 
just hits you every once in a while. Let 
that shit go.

Responsibilities — Thane, BJ the 

Chicago Kid, Anderson .Paak

When I’m in the middle of a book, 

all responsibilities fall by the wayside 

(besides 
this 
column 
of 
course). 

This was indeed the case recently. 
When I finished a heart-wrenching 
autobiography by poet and musician 
Patti Smith, I was at peace. Then, I 
thought for two seconds about how 
much work I had skipped over because 
I couldn’t stop reading. I had so much 
to catch up on and the thought made 
me buy a one-way ticket to Sobsville. 
I was riding first-class, getting served 
tissues and blankets and pints of ice 
cream while I composed myself.

After, I was ready to work. You just 

need that mini freak-out to drive you 
to get shit done.

But this cry is caused by stress. 

Stress is terrifying and everyone 
should acknowledge it as such.

I am more baffled by the cries that 

come out of left field. I can’t really 
justify it by saying I woke up on the 
wrong side of the bed. Sometimes cries 
smack you upside the head with no 
explanation.

Fire of Unknown Origin — Patti 

Smith

I’ll set the scene. I’m walking through 

Angell Hall after lecture, just got out. I 
wouldn’t say it was a particularly great 
lecture, but nothing that happened 
in class would reasonably be sad or 
stressful. It’s not like my voice cracked 
in the middle of lecture or anything 
like that. That would be absolutely 
ridiculous and I would definitely sob 
after that.

I’m walking through the halls and 

I walk past the vending machines. 
Another student is staring at the 
options, carefully weighing which 
high-in-sodium 
snack 
she 
has 
a 

hankering for today. Completely normal 
action. As I pass, I watch her type in 
the number of the corresponding snack 
on the keypad. It should be a successful 
transaction if she concentrated. Just 
then, tragedy rears its wicked head.

The moment the machine registers 

the number the student chose, it begins 
to dispense the snack. It turns out the 
student misread the snack she wanted 
and hit the wrong number, resulting 
in a different outcome than she had 
planned. With her head hung low, 
she bends down and reluctantly takes 
the snack she never truly wanted and 
walks away. I stop dead in my tracks.

Oh no.
I Feel the Earth Move — Carole 

King

This shouldn’t be happening. I 

shouldn’t be affected this way. It was 
just a snack. She’ll still get some food, 
even if it wasn’t what she specifically 
wanted. It was a happy outcome. I 

squeeze my fists like the Arthur meme, 
trying to stop whatever is going on in 
this physiological reaction.

I can feel my ducts welling up. My 

bottom lip becomes incredibly heavy, 
weighing my entire face down. I start 
clearing my throat, trying to mask my 
voice breaking.

Students walk around me. I’m sure I 

pissed off some kid late for class because 
I was just standing still in the hallway, 
staring at a vending machine and the 
ghost of the previous transaction. But 
I wasn’t even conscious. I just wanted 
everything to pause like in Adam 
Sandler’s classic piece of American 
cinema “Click.” I needed a minute to 
compose myself.

I Want the World to Stop — Belle 

& Sebastian

The first tear is almost ready to 

break free from the prison that is my 
tear duct. To be fair, the guards in 
this prison are incredibly loose, with 
inmates leaving all the time but this 
specific first tear has been in the pen 
for a minute. It is ready to bask in the 
glorious fluorescent light of Angell 
Hall.

Still blocking the flow of students, I 

know we’re past the point of no return. 
It’s going to happen whether I want it to 
or not. At this point, I don’t really have 
time to do any soul searching to try and 
connect this vending machine incident 
with any specific moment from my 
childhood in a path of free association. 
All I know is this tear is going to fall 
and I am going to have to handle it. At 
least I don’t have anywhere to be.

Three, two, one. Blastoff.

Drown In My Own Tears — Ray 

Charles

And the floodgates are open! It’s 

a free-for-all at this point. I finally 
pick up my feet and run into the 
Fishbowl. Somehow, I find a seat in 
those comically large swivel chairs so 
I can attempt to shield myself from the 
computer lab patrons.

One caveat to that plan, however. The 

Fishbowl earned its name because it’s 
completely surrounded by glass. Every 
passerby in the hallway is watching me 
shed many tears all because someone 
chose the wrong selection in the 
vending machine. Droplets stain my 
shirt and I am confident enough to 
say I am an incredibly ugly crier. I’m 
basically that photo of Kim K.

You know the one.
Finally, I have run out of tears and 

I can move on with my day. While the 
reasoning didn’t have a lot of logic, I 
feel … free.

Free — Pageants
I have cried many a river, but when I 

step outside in the winter months after 
a good cry and the cold breeze stings 
my cheeks, I feel cleansed. All of my 
worries dripped down my face one by 
one and now I’m dry, ready to think 
constructively about the best ways to 
make sure I am keeping up with my 
mental health.

I can’t let the worries of the world 

drag my shoulders farther and farther 
into the dirt. Sometimes, a cry is just 
what I need.

It’s not usually expected, but when it 

happens, I’m grateful for my fucked-up 
psyche.

The Daily in Comics

C

omics are not a genre, but 
a medium. Although The 
Michigan Daily is a text-
heavy publication, comics 

offer an entirely unique range of 
expression and nuance that text 
alone cannot. What might The 
Daily look like if it were entirely 
comics?

As you’ll see in this issue, comics 
can be about any subject — from 
personal statements to broad 
histories, from the magical to 
the mundane. Although every 
comic we’ve gathered in this 
issue relates to Ann Arbor, that’s 
about where the similarities end. 
That’s what I believe makes them 
so exciting. 

This is the first comics issue of 
the Statement, and hopefully not 
the last. I’m very grateful that 
we were able to involve so many 
different voices in this issue. We 
hope you enjoy them all!

Watching the Super Bowl from Sevilla

T

he hundred of us spent just 
a few hours together, at an 
Irish pub in Spain, standing, 

jeering 
and 
celebrating 
the 
most 

American of traditions.

Sly Fernandez de Castro came to the 

bar by himself — standing out among 
groups of American college students 
who had come to the Phoenix Pub for a 
taste of home and discounted “cerveza” 
in the Los Remedios area of Sevilla. 
He was an American soldier from 
downtown Philadelphia, based in the 
Morón Air Base in Sevilla, Spain.

De Castro was an Eagles fan, looking 

for a place with big screen TVs, good 
beer and a vibrant atmosphere.

He 
had 
considered 
flying 
to 

Minnesota for the game, even asking 
his commander for permission.

“You really want to do this?” the 

commander said to him. 

De Castro wasn’t sure and opted 

to stay in Sevilla, afraid of having his 
heart broken by his team yet again.

Then there was Aaron.
He was a shy kid. He clearly came to 

the bar for the “sport” aspect and little 
else. He didn’t drink like others in the 
bar, socialized sparingly, but was an 
enthusiastic Patriots fan. But he could 
talk smack. Throughout the game, he 
and the Eagles fan would poke fun at 
each other’s team after each dropped 
pass and holding penalty.

De Castro remained confident the 

Birds would win even as the Patriots 
began to inch closer. The Patriots fan 
wasn’t nervous until Rob Gronkowski 
failed to rein in Tom Brady’s final pass.

In the early hours of Feb. 5, the soldier 

and Aaron, like myself and so many 

others, found themselves at Phoenix 
Pub with countless other foreigners 
and some oddly-interested Spaniards in 
the supposed “American game.”

Maybe it was a longing for the United 

States, some nostalgia for our culture 
while living in a foreign country, or 
simply a desire to continue a long-
standing tradition. Nonetheless, we all 
stayed up until 4 a.m. to watch football, 
Justin Timberlake and spend time with 
our newfound friends.
I

’ve watched the Super Bowl 
since I was five. I love that every 
year for one game, for nearly 

four hours, families and friends pay 
attention to their TVs and computers. 
Some watch the Super Bowl for the out-
of-this-world plays. Others watch it 
to spend time with their friends or to 
see the latest iteration of the Doritos 
commercial, or, perhaps cringe at the 
next controversial GoDaddy ad.

Every year until I graduated high 

school, I spent Super Bowl Sunday, 
the entire day of the Super Bowl, with 
my closest friends. We would watch 
the game together, adding in our own 
inside jokes about the players and 
commercials. Then at halftime, the 
group of us, along with my younger 
cousins, would play a game of touch 
football in my backyard — imagining 
ourselves as the next Tom Brady or, 
in the case of my Giants fan friend 
Andrew, Eli Manning.

In an era when football receives — 

perhaps valid — criticism for its unjust 
treatment of protesting players, over-
militarization of games, a concern 
over injuries or in the case of one Daily 
writer, boredom, the Super Bowl serves 

as an antidote to 
these narratives.

Though 
some 

might 
argue 
that 

events 
like 
the 

Oscars 
captivate 

the 
movie-buff 

and 
casual 
film-

watcher alike, the 
Super 
Bowl 
too 

attracts 
sports 

enthusiasts toward 
its 
gameplay 
and 

pop-culture 
fans 

toward its halftime 
performances 
and 
unique 

commercials. 
Just 

ask members of the 
Beyhive what they 
think of Super Bowl 
50 and Beyoncé’s 
performance 
of 

“Formation.”

Still, there is a tendency to consider 

the Super Bowl as an activity to “unify” 
a politically and culturally divided 
nation. Not only is this assertion cliché, 
it isn’t necessarily correct.

I enjoy the Super Bowl because, 

rather than unify people from across 
the world, it captivates its audience. 
This year, whether someone tuned 
in to watch Nick Foles and the Eagles 
miraculously outplay Tom Brady, or 
to see Justin Timberlake’s extremely 
mediocre halftime performance, the 
viewer was intrigued by what would 
come next. 

That is why I love the Super Bowl. 

There is no excuse to not participate in 
the festivities, because it has something 
for everyone.

When in Spain, this realization is 

much to the glee of Spanish pickpockets, 
who feast on the absent-mindedness of 
Americans paying closer attention to 
the actions on screen than the backs of 
their jeans.
I 

had been nervous about being 
abroad for the first time during 
the Super Bowl. It is such a 

uniquely “American” event that, for me, 
represents home, friends and laughter 
and for the first time, I didn’t have a set 
plan in place.

While home for the month of January, 

I had enjoyed the Wild Card, Divisional 
and Championship games with my dad, 
but I, unfortunately, wouldn’t be home 
for the Super Bowl.

As Super Bowl Sunday approached, 

and I had settled into my home in 
Sevilla, my friends on my program 
suggested we go to the Phoenix.

It was an Irish pub that would show 

the Super Bowl, they said.

Even before stepping in, I knew it 

would be a bit different than playing 
touch football in the backyard with my 
close friends in middle school.

I arrived at the bar around 11 p.m. 

Sunday — kickoff began at 12:30 a.m. 
Monday morning — to ensure a table 
near the television. I joined many 
members of my program and more 
began to file in. The University of 
Massachusetts-Amherst 
group 
and 

other New Englanders sat in the back 
corner in their Patriots shirts, from 
the typical (Rob Gronkowski) to the 
atypical — I saw an authentic Chris 
Hogan jersey.

Nearly everyone else supported the 

Eagles in the bar, with the exception of 
a few Spanish speakers sporting Tom 
Brady shirts.

As the seemingly endless pre-game 

analysis drew to a close, and the Star-
Spangled Banner began, I finally could 
sense the “home” feeling I thought 
would be lacking when watching the 
Super Bowl abroad.

Despite watching it 5,855 miles 

from my home in Los Angeles, I knew 
I would enjoy this experience among 
new friends and fellow students. Once 
Cris Collinsworth and Al Michaels 
appeared on screen, it became real. 
It wouldn’t be my typical Super Bowl 
viewing party in the United States and 
it wouldn’t be with my close childhood 
friends, but it would be an incredible 
experience.

There was a bit of an unexpected 

downside, however. We didn’t see 
any 
Doritos 
commercials, 
Dodge 

Commercials or any commercials.

Because it was a broadcast for 

global audiences, during commercial 
breaks we instead listened to British 
commentators, 
Canadian 
football 

coaches and Redskins cornerback Josh 
Norman analyze the game’s plays. 
For some people, this proved to be 
a turnoff. For me, it was part of the 
unique experience.

And I could still follow along with 

the ads across the Atlantic thanks to 
Twitter.
T

he 
game 
continued. 
The 

Patriots came back and kept 
everyone 
engaged 
until 

Brady’s last-second heave to the end 
zone.

By the end of another close Super 

Bowl, after Brady’s pass was deemed 
incomplete, de Castro was elated. After 
an extended “surrender cobra,” Aaron 
then knew his next move. He walked 
toward de Castro — whom he had just 
met — and embraced him. They gave 
each other a customary fist bump and 
the Patriots fan offered congratulations 
to the grimacing de Castro.

Before 
that 
final 
moment, 
the 

bartenders walked over to the groggy-
eyed Americans and told us that as 
soon as the game ended, we needed to 
leave the bar and venture outside to the 
surprisingly frigid southern Spanish 
morning.

As I headed to bed at 4:30 a.m., just 

a few hours before my first class, I was 
thankful — thankful for an incredible 
experience to watch a truly “American” 
event in a foreign country.

The projector screens in the Phoenix 

captivated each American, who — 
whether there for socializing, watching 
the game or enjoying the halftime show 
— enjoyed a taste of their childhood 
homes.

I

magine pouring your blood, 
sweat and tears into a lengthy, 
time-consuming 
research 

paper, only to receive a less-than-
ideal score because of the mere fact 
that you mistakenly interchanged 
“there”, “their” and “they’re.” Or 
perhaps your overuse of the passive 
voice clouded the central points of 
your work, leading to an inevitable 
lower score. The absolute horror.

Well, it is for us copy editors, at 

least.

Huddled at a single table amid 

the beautiful mess known as The 
Michigan Daily newsroom, we’re 
perceived as one of the more quiet 
tables. 
Our 
contribution 
to 
the 

newspaper involves anticipating the 
arrival of buzzing news articles and 
intriguing opinion pieces so that we 
may silently, yet slightly snarkily, 
point out grammatical and factual 
errors. All 24 of us are diverse in 
backgrounds and experiences but 
manage to bond over our mutual 
understanding and appreciation of 
the importance of “proofreading on 
steroids.”

My fellow English nerds and I at 

the copy desk are more than happy 
doing what we do: bringing out the 
best in others’ writing. Through the 
three stages of copy editing an article 
undergoes — from primary editor to 
senior editor to the copy chief — each 
of us seeks to make the content of the 
article more accurate, the sentences 
smoother and have the story look as 
polished and professional as can be.

Copy 
editors 
single-handedly 

establish 
and 
maintain 
a 
news 

source’s credibility, making the daily 
morning paper a worthwhile read. 
Using our talented, watchful eyes, we 
make sure our readers don’t have to 

cringe at misused phrases or wince 
out of frustration at the heinous sight 
of an obviously incorrect “fact.”

As crucial as copy editors are to 

publications, we’re just as necessary 
to have around as friends who 
are always eager to pounce on the 
opportunity to enable our loved 
ones to shine through their writing, 
whether it be for an essay or a résumé. 
We catch tiny mistakes that others 
wouldn’t, saving our companions from 
potential bad grades or rejections. Oh 
yeah, we’re basically superheroes in 
our own right.

Since high school, I have been 

involved with editing publications 
— the annual yearbook being the 
main target during my pre-college 
days. When you think of yearbooks, 
it’s not typically the text within 
the book that comes to mind right 
away. However, if you were to look 
back at your high school yearbooks, 
you’ll notice the relevance of having 
a written description, caption or 
quote accompany an image that was 
perhaps becoming a little fuzzy in 
your memory over the years.

Now in college, by ensuring the 

events and activities taking place on 
campus and in the world are reported 
accurately and clearly, I like to think 
I am still working to achieve the 
same goal of informing the people of 
today and reminding the people of 
tomorrow.

We’re 
nitpicky, 
outrageously 

observant and need things to follow a 
structured set of rules — probably not 
the most lovable traits, but I promise, 
we only intend to be supportive. As 
such, be certain to let the copy editors/
proofreaders/general supporters in 
your life know how much they are 
appreciated.
