,Concerns about unionizing for
GSRAs addressed in meeting

Faculty leaders also
look for long-term
solution to tenure
. By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily News Editor
In a document given to The
Michigan Daily yesterday, the
leading faculty governing body
proposed a mechanism that
would allow individual fac-
ulty members to add up to two
years to their tenure probation-
ary period as a temporary fix to
issues with the University's cur-
rent tenure system.
This proposal came in
response to University Provost
Philip Hanlon's recommenda-
tion to amend the University's
Regent Bylaw 5.09 to extend the
tenure probationary period.
Statistics Prof. Ed Roth-
man, chair of the Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs and SACUA Vice Chair
Gina Poe, an associate professor
of anesthesiology and molecular
and integrative physiology, pre-
sented their four-point plan to
University President Mary Sue
Coleman yesterday afternoon
and plan to e-mail the document

to members of the University
Senate today.
The tenure probationary
period is the amount of time
faculty members have to obtain
tenure, which protects faculty
member's academic freedom by
ensuring they can't be termi-
nated from their position at the
University without just cause.
The centerpiece ofthe SACUA
proposal is the "checkboxto stop
the clock"method of extending
the tenure probationary period.
According to the document, an
option would be added to faculty
members' annual effort certifi-
cation page - a federally man-
dated statement that all faculty
and staff must sign to ensure
they are performing their work
appropriately - allowing them
to choose whether or not they
want to extend their tenure
clock by up to two years.
In an interview last night,
Rothman said the option would
allow faculty - specifically
clinical faculty in the Medical
School - who feel rushed by the
current eight-year tenure proba-
tionary period to extend their
clock without impacting other
faculty members.

Organizing GSRAs
* is 'not a good idea'
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
Representatives from the
University's Graduate Employ-
ees' Organization discussed
concerns about the unioniza-

tion of certain graduate student
employees at a meeting last
night organized by graduate
student research assistants.
Walter Eagle, a GSRA and
the president of the Aerospace
Graduate Student Council,
helped organize the meeting,
which was held in a conference
room in the Frangois-Xavier
Bagnoud Building on North
Campus.
Eagle wrote in an e-mail

that the purpose of the meeting
was to discuss the unionization
of GSRAs with the aerospace
department. Some GSRAs in
attendance asked members of
GEO prepared questions and
also discussed concerns regard-
ing joining the union.
Attendees of the meeting
expressed their uneasiness
aboutpaying dues to be part,
of GEO's collective bargaining
agreement. They also discussed

the differences between GSRAs
and graduate student instruc-
tors and why they should, or
should not, be included in GEO's
contractwith the University.
GEO President Rob Gillezeau,
a GSRA in the University's
Department of Economics,
estimated that 70 to 80 percent
of GSRAs are in favor of being
included under GEO's contract
and collectivebargainingrights.

By JENNIFER LEE
For the Daily
LSA students who major in
math or science, but also have
a passion for writing will soon
have the opportunity to put their

talent on their transcript.
The Sweetland Writing Cen-
ter will offer a minor in writing
beginning this fall. According to
Anne Ruggles Gere, the director
of the Sweetland Writing Center,
the minor was created to draw
more attention to writing and to
provide an organized academic
track for students who already do
a large amount of writing in their
concentrations.
The writing minor is intended

for students with various inter-
ests who are studying in all
departments of LSA, Gere said.
She added that the program is
selective and students must dem-
onstrate skill in prose writing to
be accepted to the minor.
Gere added that the minor
will help students become "par-
ticipants in 21st century writ-
ing" by giving them the capacity

Findings also show

By MARY HANNAHAN
Daily StaffReporter
A recent study conducted by
* researchers at the University's
Cardiovascular Center suggests

that gender does not affect the
risk of death during heart attack
treatments, contrary to previous
research conclusions.
In the study published in
January, researchers observed
8,771 patients from 32 hospi-
tals between 2003 and 2008.
According to Elizabeth Jackson,
assistant professor of internal
medicine and the study's lead
author, findings also showed

that women had higher rates of
bleeding due to heart attacks
that required transfusions and
higher rates of vascular compli-
cations than men.
'Jackson said because there

By JEREMY ARMAND
Daily StaffReporter
In a talk with students and
members of the University
community yesterday, Senator
Carl Levin (D-Mich.) didn't

shy away from expressing his
opinion on international mat-
ters and current events.
"There is no doubt that
there are regimes we have
supported that have seen dic-
tators using oppressive mea-
sures, and we are paying the
price," Levin told an audience
of about 40 people on campus
yesterday.
Levin - who chairs the
U.S. Senate Armed Services

Committee - spoke at the
Law School to members of
the Frank Murphy Society, a
group of Law students inter-
ested in government careers.
Levin focused his speech on
current events and his own
political experience.
Asked about the current
uprisings in the Middle East
and how the United States
should respond, Levin said the

-W Libyan leader says he will
fight to 'last- drop of blood'

PU RUI XINH UA/AP
People walk through a street scattered with rubble after an earthquake hit Christchurch, New Zealand, yesterday.
Post-quake New Zealand in
state of national emergency

After a week of
protests, Ghadafi
standing firm
CAIRO (AP) - A defiant
Moammar Gadhafi vowed to
fight to his "last drop of blood"
and roared at supporters to strike
back against Libyan protesters to
defend his embattled regime Yes-
terday, signaling an escalation of
the crackdown that has thrown
the capital into scenes of may-
hem, wild shooting and bodies in
the streets.
The speech by the Libyan lead-
er - who shouted and pounded
his fists on the podium - was
an all-out call for his backers to
impose control over the capital
and take back other cities. After
a week of upheaval, protesters
backed by defecting army units
have claimed control over almost
the entire eastern half of Libya's
1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer)

Mediterranean coast, including
several oil-producing areas.
"You men and women who
love Gadhafi ... get out of your
homes and fill the streets," he
said. "Leave, your homes and
attack them in their lairs."
Celebratorygunfire byGadhafi
supporters rang out in the capi-
tal of Tripoli after the leader's
speech, while in protester-held
Benghazi, Libya's second-larg-
est city, people threw shoes at a
screen showinghis address, vent-
ing their contempt.
State TV showed a crowd of
Gadhafi supporters in Tripo-
li's Green Square, raising his
portrait and waving flags as
they swayed to music after the
address. Residents contacted
by The Associated Press said no
anti-government protesters ven-
tured out of their homes after
dark, and gun-toting guards
manned checkpoints with occa-
sional bursts of gunfire heard
throughout the city.

International alarm rose over
the crisis, which sent oil prices
soaring to the highest level in
more than two years on Yester-
day and sparked a scramble by
European and other countries
to get their citizens out of the
North African nation. The U.N.
Security Council held an emer-
gency meeting that ended with
a statement condemning the
crackdown, expressing "grave
concern" and calling for an
"immediate end to the violence"
and steps to address the legiti-
mate demands of the Libyan
people.
Germany Chancellor Angela
Merkel called Gadhafi's speech
"very, very appalling," saying
it "amounted to him declar-
ing war on his own people."
Libya's own deputy ambassador
at the U.N., who now calls for
Gadhafi's ouster, has urged the
world body to enforce a no-fly
zone over the country to protect
protesters.

New Zealand's
worst earthquake in
80 years leaves 75
dead, 300 missing
CHRISTCHURCH, New Zea-
land (AP) - Some screamed from
inside collapsed buildings. One
woman used her mobile phone to
call her children to say goodbye.
Others tapped on the rubble to
communicate with those on the
outside.
Search teams used their bare
hands, dogs, heavy cranes and
earth movers Wednesday to pull
120 survivors from the rubble
of a powerful earthquake in one
of New Zealand's largest cities.
Officials raised the death toll to at
least 75, with 300 others listed as
missing.
As rescuers dug through the
crumbled concrete, twisted metal
and huge mounds of brick across
Christchurch, officials feared that
the death toll could rise further,
ranking the 6.3-magnitude earth-
quake among the island nation's
worst in 80 years.
"There are bodies littering the
streets, they are trapped in cars,
crushed under rubble and where
they are clearly deceased our
focus ... has turned to the living,"
police Superintendent Russell

Gibson said.
Prime Minister John Key said
at a news conference that 75 peo-
ple were confirmed to have been
killed, with 55 of them identified.
He declared a state of national
emergency, giving the govern-
ment wider powers to take control
of a rescue and recovery operation
that was growing by the hour.
Rescuers are concentrating on
at least a dozen buildings that col-
lapsed or were badly damaged.
In one of the worst, a camera
inserted into the rubble showed
images of people still alive, Christ-
church Mayor Bob Parker said. He
said 120 people were rescued from
wrecked buildings, while more
bodies were also recovered.
Some survivors emerged with-
out a scratch, while others had to
have a limb amputatedbefore they
could be freed.
Military units patrolled near-
empty streets disfigured by the
huge cracks and canyons created
in Yesterday's earthquake, the
second powerful temblor to hit
the city in five months. The quake
toppled the spire of the city's his-
toric stone cathedral and flattened
tall buildings.
"People were covered in rubble,
covered in several tons of con-
crete," said web designer Nathan-
iel Boehm, who was outside on
his lunch break when the quake
struck just before 1 pAm. He saw

the eaves of buildings cascade
onto the street, burying people
below. "It was horrific."
Mall worker Tom Brittenden
told of how he had helped pull vic-
tims from the rubble in the imme-
diate aftermath of the quake.
"There was a lady outside we
tried to free with a child," Britten-
den told National Radio. "A big bit
of concrete or brick had fallen on
her and she was holding her child.
She was gone. The baby was taken
away."
The multistory Pyne Gould
Guinness Building, housing
more than 200 workers, col-
lapsed. Rescuers, many of them
office workers, dragged severely
injured people out. Many had
blood streaming down their faces.
Screams could be heard from
those still trapped inside.
The earthquake knocked out
power and telephone lines and
burst pipes, flooding the streets
with water.
Firefighters climbed ladders
to pluck people trapped on roofs
of office towers to safety. Plumes
of gray smoke drifted into the air
from fires burning in the rubble,
and helicopters used giantbuckets
to drench them with water.
The quake even shook off a
massive chunk of ice from the
country's biggest glacier some
120 miles (190 kilometers) east of
Christchurch.

Unions hold protest in Lansing "

Members of unions
defend collective
bargaining rights
to legislators
LANSING, Mich. (AP) -
Hundreds of union members
lobbied Michigan lawmakers
yesterday to vote against mea-
sures they say would threaten
collective bargaining rights,
while smaller groups of activ-
ists rallied outside the state
Capitol against a variety of bud-
get proposals including those
that would eliminate some
tax exemptions and cut school
funding,.
The protests likely will
become frequent now that
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
has rolled out his budget pro-
posal for the fiscal year that

starts Oct. L. Lawmakers plan to
adopt a budget by late spring or
early summer.
"You have point-counter-
point going on, a little bit, in
front of the Capitol," Snyder
said yesterday, less than a week
after detailing his budget plan
to the Legislature. "This is part
of democracy. I just hope we do
it in a civilized fashion and have
an open dialogue."
Some of the protesters at yes-
terday's Michigan event said
they were inspired partly by
what's happening in Wiscon-
sin, where thousands have been
protesting at the state Capi-
tol for more than a week. The
main spark in Wisconsin has
been Gov. Scott Walker's pro-
posal to eliminate most collec-
tive bargaining rights for public
employees.
Snyder has been careful to
avoid similar showdowns in

Michigan, repeatedly saying he
will collectively bargain chang-
es he wants - including state
employee concessions of about
$180 million.
"We're two very different
states," Snyder said. ". . . It's
not confrontational with the
unions. It's about how we do
collective bargaining to achieve
a mutual outcome where we
all benefit.... I believe that's
an atmosphere we have in this
state and that's the approach
I'm taking to addressing these
issues."
Snyder also said yesterday
that some of the proposals
backed by Republicans in the
Legislature - including those
that would allow "right to work"
zones and eliminate so-called
"prevailing wage" laws for pub-
licly financed construction proj-
ects - aren't on his agenda or
high priorities.

MINOR
From Page 1A
conjunction with their academ-
ic concentration.
Along with the required
courses, students who minor
in writing must compile an
electronic portfolio. Gere said
this presents an opportu-
nity for students to reflect on
their growth as writers and to
explore writing in new media.
"Part of learning to write
well is to become reflective
about your writing," Gere said.
"The electronic aspect of the
portfolio also allows for manip-
ulation and the creation of dif-
ferent versions, which would
be useful when applying to var-
ious graduate schools or jobs."
Gere also said one of the rea-
sons for creating the minor was
to make students more market-
able in the current economic
downturn.
"In this economy, we need to
help students in every way pos-
sible to make themselves more
attractive on the job market
and to graduate schools," Gere
said. "One of the most impor-
tant things that our society is
looking for is people who write
well."
In order to create a minor
that is distinguishable from
the long-established English
major, Gere said the Sweetland
Writing Center worked with
colleagues from the English
department to set up the new
academic discipline.
The process for implement-
ing the new minor began last
fall, and the center is currently
accepting applications from
qualified LSA students until
March -7. According to Gere,
the deadline was established so
the center can notify students
of their acceptance before reg-
istration for the next semester
begins.
Patrick Manning, the stu-
dent services administrative
assistant at the Sweetland
Writing Center, said students
who are accepted can begintak-
ing courses to fulfill the minor's
requirements this spring term,

though the gateway course for
the program is not scheduled to
begin until fall.
Students who have declared
a concentration in LSA and
have completed their first-year
writing requirement with a
satisfactory grade may apply
for the minor. Once accepted,
declared students will take
at least five courses through
the Sweetland Writing Center
and the English department.
Students are also required to
incorporate their concentra-
tion program into the minor
by taking upper-level writing
requirement designated cours-
es in their concentration or in a
related field.
Other areas of LSA have
increased their focus on stu-
dent writers as well. The
English department recently
introduced a new minor, cre-
ative writing, which students
may begin applying for this fall.
Susan Parrish, the director
of undergraduate studies in the
English department, wrote in
an e-mail interview that she is
happy LSA has accepted two
new minors, adding that she
feels the two programs will be
complimentary and will fos-
ter writing development at the
University.
"With both of these minors
in place, students will have
more opportunities to work on
and perfect their writing- a
form of expression still indis-
pensable even in our increas-
ingly digital, multi-media age,"
she wrote. t
Parrish wrote that the minor
in writing differs from the Eng-
lish concentration because it is
focused on expository writing,
rather than literature-based
writing.
LSA sophomore Khari
Jones, a brain behavior and
cognitive science major, said
he thinks the writing minor
is very appropriate as-a minor
will help demonstrate that stu-
dents from non-writing majors
have the ability to write.
"It would be a good thing
for employers to see, since they
can't assume that someone is a
good writer," Jones said.

HEART ATTACKS
From Page 1A
potential for gender differences
in heart attack treatment.
"What we found was after con-
trolling for other factors such as
age and other co-morbidities, the
in-hospital mortality risk for men
and women were the same," Jack-
son said. "We also found women
had higher rates of transfusions,
or bleeding issues, and higher
rates of vascular complications."
Jackson explained that age
andother risk factors have a large
impact on heart attack mortality.
"Gender is certainly part of
the story, but it's not the whole
story," she said.
Past studies have shown that
women with heart attacks had
higher rates of mortality than
men, but these differences were

attributed to women generally
being older, Jackson said. She
noted that old age comes with
increased coronary risk factors,
which means that the women
in the study were more likely to
have diabetes or hypertension.
Increased chances for blood
issues could suggest that wom-
en's vascular disease is different
for women because it may put
them at a higher risk for vascular
complications, Jackson said. She
added that menopause may also
be a factor responsible for the
changes in women's vessels.
Jackson said the study shows
the need to explore the differ-
ence in heart attack management
techniques for men and women.
Because women were shown to
have higher rates of vascular
complications, Jackson said she
and her colleagues may also need
to look at changing on-site man-

agement of acute care in order to
decrease risk of vascular compli-
cation.
She added that more research
avenues need to be explored since
women tend to develop heart dis-
ease later in life than men and are
affecteddifferently by risk fac-
tors like hypertension.
"We've only just begun to
study. There's still alot out there
that needs to be answered," she
said.
Jackson said in the future she
would like to take her research
a step further by determining
if doctors should be perform-
ing different protocols or types
of heart attack management for
women.
By tailoring and personalizing
cardiovascular care and preven-
tion to a greater degree, Jackson
said she could "do the greatest
good for the greatest population."



SACUA

simply to alleviate the symp-
tom that's already evident in
parts of the Medical School,"
Rothman said. "Those fac-
ulty who choose to select that
option can do so, and those
faculty who don't want to
be subjected to a longer ten-
ure clock don't need to check
that."
Under the current system,
faculty may only extend their
tenure period for personal or
health reasons upon request.
The change proposed by
SACUA would, according to
the document, simplify the
process for extending the ten-
ure clock.
"The automatically
approved box also relieves the
current problem of judging
whether the reasons for freez-
ing the clock are meritorious
to a dean or a provost; it need
only be meritorious to the fac-
ulty affected, allowing anyone
to freeze their clock without
need of providing sometimes
very personal explanations
to near strangers (and bosses
at that)," SACUAs proposal
reads.
In the document, SACUA
acknowledges that the
"checkbox to stop the clock"
proposal and Hanlon's origi-
nal recommendation are
merely short-term solutions.
The document states that a
long-term solution must be
reached to ensure that fac-
ulty seeking tenure are judged
solely on their teaching and
scholarly work.
According to the propos-
al, external issues such as
decreases in funding from the
National Institutes of Health,
changes in the publishing
industry and ever-changing
family structures coupled
with an extended tenure pro-
bationary period would add
undue pressure to the already
strenuous process of obtaining
tenure.
"For example, when we
blame a change in weather,
or conditions of the field for
poor performance in baseball,
instead of the team's abilities
to adapt to the weather or the
field, we are unlikely to be able

to make a useful change," the
document states. "How then
should we as a faculty pre-
serve what we love about the
academy and make a change
in the way we conduct our
assessment to deal with these
ever changing external con-
straints?"
Rothman said SACUA
would be open to amending its
proposal if any faculty mem-
bers have other good ideas on
how to deal with the issue.
"We have 3,000 tenured
and tenure-track faculty at
the University of Michigan
and perhaps one or two of
them may come up with a
great idea," Rothman said.
"So, it's not as though we're
choosing 5.09 extension or
not choosing 5.09 extension
regardless of our preference.
It's that here's a proposal -
it's an alternative to chang-
ing 5.09 - and I suspect that
there are other proposals and
we'd be happy to hear from
them."
Hanlon put his recommen-
dation up for public comment
Monday, which is a necessary
step for changing any regent
bylaw. The proposal will be
open for public comment for
two weeks. In an e-mail sent
to all faculty members Mon-
day, Hanlon wrote that the
proposal would come before
the regents this spring.
In an interview last night,
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said he couldn't
comment about what was said
in Coleman's meeting with
Rothman and Poe, but said the
University was open to hear-
ing what the faculty had to say
on the matter.
"I don't have anything
directly, from President Cole-
man and that meeting,"
Fitzgerald said, "but this is the
period of public comment, and
all of the comments and the
responses that are gathered
or offered during this time
period will be taken into con-
sideration and considered as
the provost and the executive
officers decide to move ahead
with this proposal."

Levin added that it's not the

reducing its military presence in
the country.
"Why is this date so impor-

Gillezeau said at the meeting
he thinks including GSRAs under
GEO's contract would give the

vulnerable members of the Uni-

"It's about signaling power,"
Gillezeau said. "We are much
more likely to signal power with
GSRAs."
Mike Benson, president of
Rackham Student Government,
asked if it was possible for the
GSRAs to organize in a union
when their research and work
are more unpredictable and less
scheduled than that of GSIs, who
teach regular classes.
Gillezeau said GEO's contract
would need to be reworked to
account for these differences,
but he thinks GSRAs should be
included in the contract.

Budget cuts should be equally distributed
At a time when an alarming number of Americans are unem-
ployed and facing financial hardship, many people rely on gov-
ernment aid to supplement their incomes - or lack thereof.
The Republican controlled House, however, seems apt to balance the
budget on the backs of low-income Americans - specifically women
and children. On Feb. 18, an amendment to an important budget bill
was passed 240-185 that would end federal funding for many service
organizations, including Planned Parenthood.

nnovation has become quite
the buzzword. Josh Silverman,
the CEO of Skype, stressed it
during the Uni-
versity's Entre-
preneurship
Hour speaker
series two weeks
ago. Googling
"Mary Sue Cole-
man Innovation"
yields more than
50,000 results. ERIK
Let's imagine TORENBERG
Evan the engi-
neer, inspired
after leaving Entrepreneurship
Hour. He spends 40 hours of his next
week doing problem sets. While he's
developing his quantitative abilities,
he isn't relating this work to other
information that may spark new
ideas. Thinking innovatively is for-
eign to him because he spends much
of his time not being innovative. His
current box - his available cognitive
space - is so full he can't think out-
side of it.
It's no wonder Evan - although
this applies just as much to Hill-
ary the history major - has trouble
altering his mindset. While people
tell him to challenge conventional
wisdom, his reward mechanisms
encourage him to be subservient. He
is incentivized to solve problems and
regurgitate information, not to come
up with ideas even his professors
haven't thought of.
Evan hears Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder speak the following week
to announce winners of the Clean
Energy Prize competition and nods
in agreement as Snyder urges the
audience to be innovative. Then
Evan undergoes a similar, non-inno-
vative workweek. The cycle contin-
ues.
Evan's problem isn't awareness
- it's implementation. He has step
one down. He knows he needs to be
innovative. He just doesn't know
how. He doesn't need continuous
doses of step one. He needs steps
two, three and four. Evan can't
learn how to be innovative by con-
tinuously hearing inspirational

anecdotes. To learn the next steps,
he has to radically transform how
he views his education. He will not
attend class to receive an education
- he will acquire it. one mindset is
passive, the other is active.
While he values a knowledge
base, he will also value the abil-
ity to manipulate, connect and
produce information from that
knowledge base. He will carry a
notebook with him at all times that
stores all his ideas, no matter how
crazy. He knows that the process
will improve his ability to gener-
ate ideas. Even if he won't use them
again, he acknowledges that they
may spark a tangential idea three
weeks from now. Those collec-
tions of ideas may lay dormant until
culminating into the big one that
strikes in a couple years.
He will share his ideas with
friends and those who may provide
insight, while inturn seekingto hear
their ideas. He will read relevant, as
well as random, information out of
genuine curiosity. He'll harass pro-
fessors about the things they didn't
mention. He will understand that
becoming innovative is an active
process in which he will receive lit-
tle feedback.
Evan can't directly be taught how
to be creative, but he can place him-
self in an environment conducive to
developing innovative thinkers - a
culture that encourages making and
learning from mistakes and having
a physical and mental space where
people can gather and engage in
self-designed projects. What if the
University encouraged students to
allocate time and cognitive space to
pursuing collaborative projects in
the same way Google does with its
employees? Google's concept of 20
percent time - a policy that allows
engineers to spend one day a week
working on a non-work related proj-
ect - is known for cultivating a cul-
ture of innovation.
Writer Steven Johnson high-
lights the importance of incen-
tives, proclaiming that great ideas
don't result from solitary eureka
moments in the woods. They arise

from liquid networks - environ-
ments where ideas are in constant
contact with each other.
The University has started to
value such an environment. It offers
classes where students work in
teams to pursue ventures. The 1,000
Pitches competition encouraged stu-
dents to present and work on their
business ideas. While the project
is primarily business oriented, the
same concept could be aimed toward
students who are more interested in
targeting specific social issues. It
could be called something like Solv-
ing 1,000 Problems.

The amendment's sponsor Rep. Mike Pence
(R-Ind.) has been a longtime opponent of
Planned Parenthood. According to the Detroit
News, Michigan Planned Parenthood clinics
alone will lose $5 million in funding if the bill
passes through the Senate. This amendment,
along with other parts of the bill, stems from
the simple fact that $50 billion of cuts need to
be made. But taking away necessary programs
and funding aimed to help woman and the poor
is irresponsible.
The amendment is largely an anti-abortion
measure. Planned Parenthood is one of the
major providers of abortions in the nation -
though they can't use federal funds to pay for
abortions except in cases of rape, incest or
when the mother's life is at risk. The organi-
zation is constantly targeted by conservatives,
including Fox News host Glenn Beck. Critics
don't realize that an overwhelming majority
of Planned Parenthood's patients visit clinics
for reasons other than family planning. These
include HIV counseling, sexual identity coun-
seling, sexually transmitted disease testing
and cancer screening. These are necessary ser-
vices that go beyond party politics.
Equally troubling is the plan for this bill to
slash 10 percent of funding for Woman, Infant,
and Children - a service of the United States
Departfient of Agriculture that provides food,
health care referrals and nutrition information
to low-income mothers.ADec. 2003 University
of California Los Angeles study showed that

pregnant women who participate in WIC have
healthier babies than those who do not. This
program, vital to the survival and nutrition
of many American families, is set to lose $747
million. While a10-percent cut seems insignifi-
cant, it would do great damage to the women
who rely on WIC to provide essentials for their
children.
Most patients of Planned Parenthood and
WIC recipients are poor women. Cutting
them off from effective and inexpensive med-
ical care and financial support isn't the right
way for Congress to go about balancing the
budget. There are other areas of the budget
that should have been brought to the bargain-
ing table first. The enormous Department of
Defense budget, the Bush-era tax incentives
and cuts for the wealthy should also be exam-
ined as possible areas to reduce spending and
generate revenue before welfare programs are
completely eliminated.
There is no doubt that cuts and sacrific-
es need to be made by all Americans as the
nation's budget woes are addressed. But it's
important that those sacrifices are distributed
equally throughout every sector of the popu
lation.
Many Republicans may be opposed to abor-
tion, but using personal morals to make budget
cuts at the expense of those less fortunate is
unacceptable. The general well-being of low-
income Americans shouldn't be a bargaining
chip in a political game.

The problem isn't
awareness - it's
implementation.
While providing incentives will
encourage innovation, students
should value the inherent ben-
efits involved in cultivating such
an environment. Is there a better
environment for liquid networks
than the University? Students have
the ability to share ideas with their
peers, knowledgeable professors
and eager alumni - they just have
to care to do it. Evan may organize
a meeting to do this after Entrepre-
neurship Hour.
The next time he hears that he
needsto challenge conventional wis-
*dom, he will stop and look around.
As the crowd nods their heads in
unison, Evan will consider: How so?
Which conventional wisdoms? And
in challengingthem, what new ques-
tions will he propose?
He may even skip the talk alto-
gether, opting to pursue some other
self-designed project instead. He
may hypothesize that those speak-
ers probably would have done the
same thing.

GEO objectives need to be
properly represented
TO THE DAILY:
I was disappointed by the many misrepre-
sentations contained in The Michigan Daily's
recent editorial concerning the efforts of
graduate student research assistants to form
a union (One union doesn't fir all, 02/22/2011).
The editorial said that the Graduate Employ-
ees'Organization had "overstepped its bounds"
in efforts to unionize GSRAs. The piece's tone
also indicated that GEO was trying to bully the
University into making GSRAs join GEO.
Both of these suggestions are false. First,
in the current contract negotiations between
GEO and the University, the subject of GSRAs
is what is known as a "permissive subject" of
bargaining, as the Daily points out. The Uni-
GSRAs are enthusiastic
aboutjoining GEO

versity is within its rights not to discuss the
issue. However, GEO also has a right to bring
the issue up at the table - it's not somehow
out of bounds.
But more important is the misrepresenta-
tion of what precisely GEO wants. The union
isn't trying to get GSRAs incorporated into
the union by the stroke of a pen against their
will. Instead, we want the Universityto agree
to a process under which GSRAs can make
their own decisions about whether or not
they want to have a union. Specifically, we
want the University to remain neutral during
the organizing campaign and not spread mis-
information among GSRAs while they think
about their decision to sign a card signifying
that they want union representation.
Samantha Montgomery
Organizing Committee Chair, Graduate
Employees' Organization
ing hundreds of conversations with individual
GSRAs across campus. The vast majority of
these conversations are polite, friendly and
informative for both the organizer and the
GSRA - I should know as I've taken part in
some of them. At the end of the day, roughly
three quarters of GSRAs approached so far
have signed a membership card. Certainly
there are a few GSRAs who don't want a union
- and we don't bully them or anyone else into
signing cards - but they are dwarfed by the
overwhelming numbers of graduate employees
who are enthusiastic about their new member-
ship in the Graduate Employees' Organization.
In its future coverage of this issue, I hope the
Daily backs claims with detailed evidence.
Patrick O'Mahen
Rackham student

travesty is ravaging the city
of Ann Arbor.
Akin to genocide, snow-
flakes - lost and
without a home
are being
trampled left
and right. For
some, this means
melt. For oth-
ers, it just means
the pain of being
trampled. Why? ERIC
Because many SZKARLAT
people are not
shoveling or
salting their sidewalks. Nary in his-
tory has such a widespread geno-,
cide gone so unnoticed.
In 1986, a radical group formed
the People for the Humane Treat-
ment of Snowflakes (PHTS). The
group was founded on the belief that
snowflakes are people too - er, well,
not exactly, but I think you under-
stand the point. "No snowflake,"
states the preamble to the PHTS
charter, "ought to be trampled and
left for melt because a tenant has
not properly kept their property."
Some think snowflakes that land
on sidewalks deserve to get tram-
pled for landing on our sidewalks.
"If they didn't land there, they
wouldn't have been trampled," said
a prominent House Republican.
But this philosophy is noth-
ing short of social darwinism and
should be discouraged. It's not.of
the snowflakes' fault that they land
where they do. PHTS has worked
hard to make sure that people
understand that snowflakes have
very little choice in where they land.
PHTS has a simple solution:
Sidewalks should be shoveled. This
simple gesture would save millions

of snowflakes from ahorrible fate of
melt and refreeze.
PHTS isn't mum on the issue of
salting, either. Their official web-
site policy states: "PHTS recognizes
that salting is a suitable alternative
to shoveling. This spares snowflakes
the .embarrassment and agony of
being trampled." Opponents, of
course, are quick to find this hypo-
critical. They question whether we
should believe that PHTS is actually
invested in improving conditions
for snowflakes, or whether they are
merely invested in their own per-
sonal gain.
And the opposition might be
on to something there. The PHTS
website also goes into great detail
regarding the human benefit from
snow removal: "Laborers, students
and the physically disabled all use
sidewalk paths regularly. These
paths may become dangerous when
walked on repeatedly, as friction
causes melt and the melted snow
then refreezes, forming ice patches.
These ice patches can often cause
people to slip and fall, causing inju-
ries."
I can see the point they're trying
to make. I walk past Alpha Delta
Phi fraternity on State Street every
day, and in the winter, it's a trek. I
can't even make it to the Union bus
stop in time if I run. Between the
boots and the six inches of snow, it's-
almost impossible. And I know that
in just a fewweeks the snowis going
to be completely iced over. Then I
won't be able to walk on it, let alone
run to catch a bus.
Then I consider the mail carriers
who are obligated to report to every
house in the city. At least where I'm
from, the mail carriers have the
option to cease delivery if the mail-

box is inaccessible, but it almost
seems like that never happens here.
I don't think the people on Cross
Street can go without mail for an
entire month. But the snow stays
there the whole time. Mail carriers
should just cease delivery, though,
and as long as they have that option,
I can't offer them any sympathy.

Residents should
keep their
sidewalks clear.
I heard a campus, myth that
you can actually get ticketed up
to $1,000 if you don't shovel your
sidewalks. I laughed when I heard
it first. But really, I can't wait until
The Michigan Daily asks Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
whether it's true or not.
No, I'm not deranged, high or
stupid. Yes, "People for the Humane
Treatment of Snowflakes" is com-

snowflakes humanely is what gets
you to shovel your snow, I'm not
complaining. The problems and
annoyances of people not salting

very real, so I implore the citizens
of Ann Arbor to shovel or salt their

Do it for the snowflakes.

TO THE DAILY:
Among several slipshod arguments in its
Feb. 21 editorial regarding the unionization
efforts of graduate student research assistants
(One union doesn'tfit all, 2/22/2011), The Michi-
gan Daily flatly stated that "many GSRAs don't
wantto join the union." That's a bold statement,
and I expected to see some solid evidence back
it up. Did the Daily have survey data? Nope.
Perhaps they at least interviewed some GSRAs
to get their opinion for the editorial? Appar-
ently not.
Here are some facts: Organizers (many of
whom are GSRAs themselves) have been hav-

his next foray - writer Aaron
Sorkin's much-hyped but short-

same character to a sophisticat-

expected.
Perry's latest project, "Mr.

- indeed, the caustic title of the
show itself is an indication. Perry
plays Ben Donovan, manager of a

have time in their lives for fun
and distractions. As- the only

one who actually does his job,
Ben has to solve the problems
everyone else ignores - loose
elephants, bratty teenage pop
stars and equipment malfunc-
tions among them.
Chronicling the absurd in the
everyday operations of a sports
arena, the show seems to have
all the pieces in place for a laud-
able distraction. While Perry's
biting sarcasm can run thin at
times, it's well balanced with a

there are also Jorge Garcia

"Bobert") and Nate Torrence
("Get Smart"), who plays Crys-

Roman.
With enough personali-

Mr. Sunshine follows in the
spirit of better shows like "Mod-

but it lacks the game-changing
swagger that made those shows
instant classics. Still, given its
strategic placement in the times-

lot immediately following the
wildly popular "Modern Fami-
ly," the show should benefit from
a reasonable holdover audience
while it finds its footing. That
factor paired with the many nos-
talgic "Friends" fans who will
tune in, at least initially, should
get the show off with enough of a
ratings momentum to return for
a full season in the fall.
And we should hope that the
show does succeed, because,
whatever else it may lack, it is
an excellent vehicle to showcase
the very talented Perry: The man

rooted in Japanese villages, these
rhythms resound throughout the
world on each stage on which
Kodo appears.
Kodo is a traditional Japanese
Taiko drumming group that
formedin 1981and has performed
worldwide and will play at Hill
Auditorium tonight. The group's
name cantranslate to "heartbeat"
or "children of the drum." Having
first performed in Ann Arbor in
1982, Kodo is on its current world
tour, entitled "One Earth."

"Kodo is regarded as one of
the important, traditional music
groups of Japan,"said Jun Akimo-
to, one of the group's managers.
"It is respected as a traditional
Japanese performing art."
The group is composed of 25
members, ranging in age from 21
to 60. For each member, training
is rigorous.
According to Akimoto, mem-
bers must train themselves
physically, rhythmically and
mentally. In this process, mem-
bers are expected to runf6.2 miles
a day before they begin their
musical training.
"There are all types of drum-
ming techniques and style skills
that members are required to be
able to do in order to perform in
the traditional way," Akimoto
said. "Members must learn to
open their mind and be con-
nected with the clarity of the art-
form."

the feeling
of doing whatever it takes. What
sounds like college applications
is actually the application pro-
cess for a preschool in the play
Basement Arts production of
"Bright Ideas."
Eric Coble's play is a dark com-
edy that students can relate to
and appreciate at different levels.
It describes a couple's relation-
ship and struggle to get their
toddler son into one of the most
prestigious preschools around.

The parents, Josh and Gen
Bradley, played by MT&D sopho-
more Nick Skardarasy and Zoe
Kanters, an LSA sophomore who
is also an MT&D freshman, take
extreme measures to ensure their
son Mac enters intothe preschool
- no matter the cost.
"(The play is) about the lengths
they're willing to go to get their
son into a great school and the
aftermath of that decision with
all the craziness it involves," play
director and MT&D sophomore
Emily Lyon said.
In the first act, Gen is speak-
ing with her wealthy co-worker,
who, after purchasing an aquat-
ics room for Bright Ideas Early
Childhood Development Acade-
my, has guaranteed her son a spot
in the school.
Since Gen and Josh aren't as
rich, they freak out. In a frenzy,
the pair decides to invite Gen's
co-worker over to dinner and pro-
ceed to murder her with poisoned
pesto, since Mac is next in line on
the waitlist for the preschool.
The rest of the play is a conse-
quence of this decision and ends
with a bang at Mac's fourth birth-
day party.
Though there is a strong
emphasis on the children, the

audience never actually sees any
of them on stage. In addition, all
actors, aside from Gen and Josh,
serve as multiple characters,
wearing different outfits - add-
ing a new layer of humor to the
story.
Lyon described Gen as a typi-
cal mother who succumbs to the
pressures of perfection for both
herself and her son and becomes
consumed with the new power
and paranoia she found by elimi-
nating someone.
Josh balances her out as the
dweeb who reads Oprah Maga-
zine, does yoga and develops a
drinking problem as the play pro-
gresses. Skardarasy described
his character as a strange and
intriguing guy who progressively
breaks out of his mold.
"It's fun to play a character
who has all these different ele-
ments," Skardarasy said. "He has
sadistic elements, but he's also
fun, kind of goofy and at the same
time very human."
The whole play also echoes
Shakespeare's "Macbeth" in
terms of minute details like Gen
and Josh referring to themselves
as "partners in greatness" - just
as Lady Macbeth and Macbeth
do in Shakespeare's work. The

M' faces Badgers in
search of quality win

ICE HOCKEY
Hagelin gets flag as send off

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan meen's basketball
coach John Beilein says that for
his team, the game slows down
the second time around in Big Ten
play.
It's not that the actualspeed and
pace slow, or that teams stop run-
ning their fast
breaks, but for
the young play-
era, the college at Michigan
game becomes Matchup:

minds adapt gan 17-11

But of any of 6:30 P.M.
the teams in the Where:
Big Ten, No. 12 Crisler Arena
Wisconsin is one
of the few that TV/Radio:
almost couldn't BTN
slow down any
further. Its methodical offense -
a near perfection of the Princeton
set - beat the Wolverines, 66-50 in
early January. And with the expe-
rience the Wolverines gained since
then, Michigan may be able to see
the game in slow motion now.
The Badgers are still riding a
high from beating then-No. 1 Ohio
State in Madison less than two
weeks ago, but Wisconsin coach
Bo Ryan's squad is less fearsome
on the road - all six of the Badgers'
losses this season have come away
from the Kohl Center.
With three games left in the

regular season, the Wolverines
have the opportunity to playthree
top-50 RPI teams, with Wisconsin
being the first on Michigan's slate.
"It's rare that you have these
opportunities where you have
these great teams - two at home
and one away - that you can be in
a position where we're in," Beilein
said Tuesday. "We're certainly a
top-tOO team tryingto beat one of
those 68 teams. So we have oppor-
tunities here. We're going to do
everything we can to take advan-
tage of them."
The biggest threat for the Wol-
verines is Wisconsin's junior Jor-
dan Taylor, who's commanded the
Badgers'offense this season with a
military-like precision. The 6-foot-
1 point guard averages 18 points
and just three assists per game.
But his most impressive feature is
that, despite the fact that he han-
dles the ball for most of the game,
he turnsthe ball over only once per
game. He boasts the nation's high-
est assist to turnover ratio - 4.13.
"Everybody touches the ball in
what they run, but (Taylor)'s going
to have it most of the time," Beilein
said. "He's just very calm and cool
and collected - it's what he does."
The Badgers are notorious
for forcing opponents to defend
for nearly the entire shot clock
before hitting a shot in the wan-
ing moments, which tires even
a well-conditioned team. And if
they don't have any luck getting in
the lane, Wisconsin can rely on its
long-range shooting - it has three
players whoshoot over 40 percent

from behind the arc.
But Taylor will match up against
sophomore point guard Darius
Morris, who saw just 21 minutes
of floor time when the two teams
faced off on Jan. 5 in Madison - a
memory that could very well light
a fire under the 6-foot-4 Morris.
At the Kohl Center, despite
shooting 40 percent from the field,
the Wolverines were outscored by
the Badgers, 40-22, in the second
stanza.
"We have to pick our right
shots," Beilein said. "If we're
guarded, we're not going to shoot
it. We're going to make sure that
we keep working until we get the
right shot, not just any shot."
The Wolverines' first road game
of the season was their loss to the
Badgers.
And since then a seemingly
new team has emerged, one that
is seeing the game more slowly, as
Beilein may put it.
"They're going to get better as
the year goes on," Ryan said after
Wisconsin beat Michigan in Janu-
ary. "But (the Wolverines have)
got young guys that are playing
loose. Sometimesabeing young isn't
always what other people make it
out to be.
"Those guys know how to shoot
it, they know how to pass it. Defen-
sively they're better, I thought.
That's why they've won some
games maybe with their youth.
(Beilein) scheduled those eight
games at home for a reason. Get
those young guys to play a little
older."

With one heave over the glass,
the era was over.
After last Saturday's Senior
Night overtime victory, all seven
of the No. 10 Michigan hockey
team's departing seniors made a
lap around the ice carrying block
M' flags. With spotlights on the
seniors as the only lighting in the
arena, captain Carl Hagelin skat-
ed toward the glass near Section
17 with his teammates.
The monstrous Swedish flag
that had made its home in the
section for much of the past two
years was hoisted over the glass
with the yellow cross embla-
zoned with the black marks of
students' signatures.
Hagelin, a native of Sodertalje,
Sweden, took the flag, put it over
his shoulder, and skated on. He
has more games to play, but this
game - a game that ended with
last-minute goals by Hagelin both
in regulation and overtime - was
the last the flag will see.
It's Hagelin's now.
At the postgame press confer-
ence he said getting the flag was
pretty emotional. Engineering
junior Rob Eckert, the now-pre-
vious owner of the flag, felt the
same way.
"It marked that the era of Carl
had moved on," Eckert said. "It
had become such a big part of the
student section for the past two
years, this season and the season
before. It was kind of weird hav-
ing this little - I guess you could

conversation and a week in
France mulling over the offers he
had in front of him, there was no
question about where Carl was
headed.
* Sixty minutes after
hearing the Swedish national
anthem played in Yost before his
last regular season home game,
Carl sent the seniors out on a
bang.
"I can't believe we're almost
done," Carl said after the win.
Against Western Michigan,
he muscled out two goals. With
40 seconds left in regulation
and then again with just three
seconds left in overtime. It was
his time to do what he does best.
Neither goal was pretty - the
tying tally came off a soft wrist
shot that hit a Bronco defense-
man before passing Western
Michigan goalie Jerry Kuhn,
and the game-winner was a slap
shot from the top of the left cir-
cle that sealed the win for the
seniors.
But they were both goals by a
player determined to impact the
outcome, as he came up big when
the Wolverines needed it most -
twice.
"He plays with energy every-
day but it seemed like he was
trying to do something special,"
Berenson said. "And we knew
what that was, and obviously he
did that. Maybe we have to play
* the Swedish national anthem
every weekend."
On senior night, with the
Wolverines down by one near
the end of the third, he took over
the game when the team needed
someone.
All this in front of his parents,
in front of a crowd so apprecia-
tive of his four years that stu-
dents signed the Swedish flag
that flew proudly in the Yost
crowd after every goal, in front
of his teammates.
He wasn't just good on senior
night. He was great.
"I just told him, 'Aren't you
glad you came to Michigan', and
'Aren't we glad that you came,' "
Berenson said. "He's set a stan-
* dard here. He's been a terrific
kid, student, player, teammate,
just a terrific kid. He's the first
Swedish player we've had, and
we'll always remember him."

On the rebound, Carl put it

He was in the right place at
the right time - literally to the
right of a sprawled out goalten-
der.
Skating around the back of
the goal, he threw his hands up
in celebration. He lifted his left
leg, extended his left arm and
used his stick as the bow of a
violin, sliding it back and forth
across his arm four times before
his teammates bombarded him
against the glass.
Carl had just scored his eighth
goal of the season, and this one

For those few seconds as his
stick was used in celebration,
the goal wasn't just about hock-

For Carl, the violin was some-
thing much bigger - it was about
family and heritage.
It was about where he came
from and where he's going.
It was about Carl Axel.
"His cousin told me, with
tears in his eyes ... that (Carl's
celebration) was something for
his uncle," Turnersaid.
This wasn't any regular sort
of game, though it was no sur-
prise that Hagelin played hero
here too.

"I think it was just excit-

had all the people there and my
brother showed up, my sister, my
mom and dad and their friends,"
Carl said.
"They were all talking about

In fact, my siblings and I, on

In the fifth grade, my class studied

ration of the unknown West. One
of the test questions for that unit
dealt with the mountain ranges

Pacific Ocean. I wrote down the
Bitterroot Mountains. My teacher
marked that answer wrong - the
correct answer was the Rocky
Mountains. After class, I had to

mother as a gift for my father's
50th birthday, the quilt has 50 pho-

Some of these photos feature my
father as a knee-knocking youngin'
in the '60s; some present a smiling
bearded man with his arms around
me and my siblings. In the center
of the quilt is a patchwork compass

embroidered underneath. As the
quilt's central text reveals, my dad
- at age 50 - achieved his goal of
traveling to all 50 states.
For me and my siblings, that
aspiration was reached in about
half that time. By age 17, I had seen

From Page 5B
John moved to the United
States from India in 2006. She
attended an architecture pro-
gram at the University of Cincin-
nati before deciding to switch to
business. She began attending
the Ross School of Business in
fall 2009, focusing her studies on
market retail.
By then she had met her hus-
band - a University post-doctor-
al graduate who works at a sales
biotech firm - and they decided
to start a family.
For John, time was of the
essence.
"We wanted to have a kid
even before I started (business)
school," John said.
"It didn't work out at that time,
-- (so) we just didn't stop trying
after that."
For John, nothing would get
in the way of starting a family -
not even the notoriously rigorous
two-year business program she
just started.
"I was more nervous about

not unique - I sometimes meet
others who can boast the same
accomplishment - it's rare. Plus,
my family doesn't count "driving
through" a state as legitimate. We
have requirements. You must spend
at least two nights in a state and do
something of historical, local or
cultural significance.
I was unique in my group of
childhood and teenage friends.
While most people I knew got
to lounge around during school
breaks, my family was on the road
at the crack of dawn and didn't
return until the last possible min-
ute. We would go on at least three
"vacations" a year: one during win-
ter break, one during spring break
and one behemoth three-week-
long journey we would undertake
every August before school started.
And to be clear, these "vacations"
were not of the relax-on-the-beach
variety (though we have been vis-
waiting two years and not know-
ing when we were going to start
a family," John said, "So I think
it's just something I decided I
would work out ... on'a moment-
by-moment basis."
John became pregnant shortly
thereafter, and quickly began
experiencing the difficulties of
being an expectant parent and
full-time student.
"You feel tired and sick, and
you're hungry all the time," John
said.
Though these effects are com-
mon among pregnant women,
John had the added burden of
having to deal with them in class-
es.
"I found myself controlling the
nausea by constantly-eating, so I
had to eat in classes," John said.
"I just didn't have an option."
She was also forced to cut down
on some classes due to fatigue
and a period of bed rest.
John added that her classmates
and people working on projects
with her were understanding and
accommodating.

There was no respite: It was five
to a hotel room, five to a bath-
room and you could never escape.
We learned to deal with it and co-
exist with each other. Now, I'd say
we're as close as any siblings could
become - not only because we've
spent so much time together and
have so many stories to share and
memories to recount, but because
we three are the only people on this
planet who really understand what
it means to see America through
the fanaticism of our father. And
we three are the only people I
know who could have that bizarre
of a childhood and still, for some
reason, love to travel, love to learn
and love to be with each other.

formance was largely a result of
the mental and physical stresses
of beinga new mom.
"I didn't have the time to pre-
pare for (the interviews) effec-
tively or fully be there mentally,"
John said. "I was trying to do
everything and something had to
give."
But John said the sacrifices
she has made for Tara have been
worth it because of the strong
bond she has with her daughter.
"She's able to crawl now, and
she comes straight at me when
I walk in the door," John said.
"That's very gratifying to know
she values that relationship that
much."
And despite the obstacles she's
faced asa new mom, she said she's
excited and up to future multi-
tasking.
"That's one thing the Business
School really teaches you about,"
John said. "It teaches you to allo-
cate time and to pick what's most
important."
John will need that abil-
ity moving forward - especially
since she's expecting a second
child this July.

helped me know what to expect,"
John said.
But as John pointed out, it's
not possible for Business stu-
dents to have a light work load,
and by summer she had scored a
big internship at Sears, Roebuck
& Co. in Chicago. Adding to her
pressures, this was during the
third trimester of her pregnancy.
The internship was cut short
when she gave birth to Tara in
July.
"That was the end of my intern-
ship," John said with a smile.
John said adjusting to her
fall semester with an additional
member of the family wasn't easy.
"I did not know what it would
be like to look after a baby on a
day-to-day basis," John said.
Fortunately, John's mother,
travelled from India to help
raise Tara. Five months later,
her mother left and John's in-
laws moved in. John said without
their continual assistance, she
wouldn't have been able to handle
class and raising a child.
"I would have had to skip out of
(material) that's critical to your
performance in class," John said.

"I don't think it would have been
feasible to do that."
Even with the assistance of
relatives, John found the balance
difficult.
In addition to taking five class-
es and studying frequently, she
had to start preparing for serious
job interviews - a prospect made
more formidable by her lack of
sleep.
As John explained, attending
to Tara meant only getting an
average of four hours of sleep a
night.
"I did have to sleep a lot less,"
John said. "I had to be there for
the baby, who was not sleeping
through the night."
Come morning, John would get
up for class at 8 a.m. and be gone
until 8 p.m., when she came home
in time to give Tara a bath, feed
her and clean her bottles before
going off to study until she felt
like she "was about to drop."
"It was exhausting to do, but I
just pushed myself to do it," John
said.
John ultimately didn't per-
form well in the first round of job
interviews. She said her poor per-

random student interview by stephen ostrowski

Welcome to the Ran-
dom Student Inter-
view, where the line
between journalistic integ-
rity and personal boundaries
becomes blurred.
There's alot of pressure on me
to make this funny. So you bet-
ter do well.
OK, I'll try. I'll do my best.
What are your spring break
plans?
I'm going to Los Angeles.
Are you telling me the truth? I
just met you.
I mean, I'm a straightforward
guy. You can trust me.
So if we become friends after
this, you're not going to dou-
ble-cross me?
No, I'm not going to do that.
All right. I just want to clear
the air on that.
I'm not that kind of guy.
That's great to know. I'm sure
there are a lot of lovely ladies
who would want to know that
as well. Um, so what's bringing

you to L.A. on spring break?
I'm visiting some family out
there, and the weather and
everything.
The weather? Cool.
Yeah.
Cool. What are you going to do
out in L.A.?
Pretty much just relax, go to the
beach...
Read a book or two?
Maybe.
You're not the reading type?
Kind of. It depends.
On what? whether or not you
like to read? Does it fluctuate?
Sometimes I like reading, some-
times I don't.
When do you like reading?
When it's not school related.
OK. So what non-school relat-
ed material do you like to read?
Sports stuff I guess you could say,
pretty basic yeah.
You're an intelligent guy, I can
tell.
Yeah, exactly. I learn a lot.
OK. Anything else you like?

"Harry Potter," newspaper
circulars?
Not really. Never read a "Harry.
Potter" book.
Well then I think we're going
to have a lot of good conversa-
tions moving forward. By the
way, I apologize, I'm a little
stuffy and sick. My doctor said
I should stop being contagious
in a few days so you're fine.
OK. Good to know.
It's only swine flu. Don't worry
about it. What are your sum-
mer plans looking like?
I really have no idea, um ...
You've invested a lot in your
future.
Yeah, pretty much.
What would you like to do?
I don't know. I'm going to try to
work at the pool I worked at last
.summer so I got to figure that
out. Relax, have fun with my high
school friends I guess.
So you're still attached to high
school?
Yeah, definitely.

Like a "Dawson's Creek" kind
of thing for you?
Yeah.
You watch "Dawson's Creek?"
I'm a huge fan.
Interesting.
I'm a huge fan.
Finally we can relate on some-
thing. I guess the last few ques-
tions rounding up: what'd you
get at Pizza Hut?
I got a pepperoni pizza and some
breadsticks.
Is that your favorite place in
the Union?
Yeah, that or Wendy's. Depends.
Because they're healthy or
what do you like about them?
I mean, the health factor defi-
nitely plays a role, and I don't
know. It's not too expensive I
guess.
I'll see you at the gym.
I came from the gym.
I can tell. All right, thank you
Tom.

for the entire class.
So if time is money and class takes
time, you could instead be spending
at least a few dollars if you are a light
user, $15 if you are a medium user and
$30 to $50 dollars if you are a heavy
user during an hour-and-a-half class.
Maybe Facebook isn't so free.
Next time you are in a lecture hall
and find your finger drifting toward
the Facebook bookmark on your
Internet browser, just imagine Mark
Zuckerburg, in all his reclusive glory,
slipping into the seat next to you and
reaching his hand into your pocket to
pluck a pair of shiny quarters.
Amy Hassan, an LSA freshman
from San Diego, says she uses Face-
book "too much" during class. She
admitted she can be on Facebook for
a full hour during a lecture period.
When she was asked whether or not
she would go on Facebook for an hour
in class if it cost her $50, her response
was immediate.
"Definitely not," she said. "Not
nearly as much."
In the survey, 36 percent said that
Facebook was "pretty important" to
their lives and 12 percent said that it
was "very important." Eighty-three
percent of respondents said they visit
Facebook without consciously mak-
ing the decision to do so.
LSA freshman McKenna Green
said it's definitely possible to be
addicted.
"I'm compulsively checking it on
my phone or on my computer all the
time," she said.

She also echoed the response from
the student survey, saying she some-
times found herself on Facebook
without making the conscious effort
to go to the site.
To call something "addictive" is
attaching a pretty sizeable red flag.
There are many examples of non-
chemical activities that have been
known to be addictive. The Ency-
clopedia of Mental Disorders refers
to these as "process addictions."
Gambling, sex, and binge eating are
examples of addictions that studies
have shown to overlap with chemi-
cal-related addictions.
"It's a question of what's going on
in the brain," said the James Olds
Collegiate Professor of Psychology
and Neuroscience, Kent Berridge.
"People who are compulsively eating,
gambling or compulsively pursuing
sex could have some of the same fea-
tures a drug addict has."
The modern definition of addic-
tion has changed over the past few
decades. The more outdated quali-
fication for addiction was grounded
in withdrawal effects or the "com-
pulsive nature of addiction -that it
becomes uncontrollable, it persists
even when a person tries to quit,"
according to Berridge.
The Encyclopedia of Mental Disor-
ders does not recognize a "Facebook
Addiction," but it does recognize an
Internet addiction disorder.
"One symptom of Internet addic-
tion is excessive time devoted to
Internet use. A person might have

difficulty cutting down on his or
her online time even when they are
threatened with poor grades or loss
of a job," according to the Encyclo-
pedia.
Facebook makes it difficult to quit.
You cannot delete your account. It
is not an option. Instead, Facebook
offers the option of "deactivating."
By deactivating you are preventing
yourself from receiving notifica-
tions - and that's about it. It is
essentially the same as logging out of
your account. When you feel the itch
to return all you need to do is click
"login."
The site's mission statement is to
"give people the power to share and
make the world more open and con-
nected." However, when it comes to
power there seems to be a significant
incongruence in its allocation.
Try calling Facebook's head offic-
es in Palo Alto, Calif., and you will
be directed to an automated voice
machine, which will offer a set of
options. Every single option will lead
to another voicemail that will encour-
age you to send them an e-mail, or
visit their website.
Considering its privately held
stocks, circuitous voicemail and
reclusive founder, this company
hardly seems to be the paradigm of
openness and connection it claims
to be. When it comes to understand-
ing the phenomenon of Facebook, we
have a limited view of its profile.
Mr. Zuckerburg could not be
reached for comment.

T urn off FarmVille for a second and
imagine you're sitting in a lecture
hall with 300 students listening
to a professor drone on about particle
physics or "The Canterbury Tales." In
any case, you are bored. However, your
professor allows computers in the class-
room, strictly for note-taking purposes.
Well, what the professor doesn't know
won't hurt him, and laptops aren't trans-
parent. You are free to take notes - or
browse the Internet.
It is almost startling how different a
lecture hall would look from the front
of a room versus standing in the back.
If you stood in the front and looked out,
you may see a large room filled with dili-
gent students furiously clicking away at
their keyboards while taking notes. But
if you run up the stairs and stand at the
very back of the hall you'll see students
scrolling through pictures, commenting
on statuses and poking that cute girl sit-
ting on the other side of the room.
The cult ofFacebook began roughly six
years ago in the dorm room of a Harvard
student in Cambridge, Mass., and now
it's an international phenomenon. What
was once an exclusive Harvard-only sign
of superiority has become the quintes-
sential means of communication world-

wide. During this year's Super Bowl,
almost every advertisement encouraged
viewers to visit their Facebook page,
rather than their company's home page.
The Middle East and North African head
of marketing for Google, Wael Ghonim,
was instrumental in the Egyptian revolt
earlier this month, and was referred to
by Newsweek as the "Facebook Freedom
Fighter" because of his employment of
social networking for political purposes.
Even President Barack Obama's 2008
presidential campaign used Facebook to
reach out to a powerful youthful demo-
graphic.
How much a company produces, its
scope and its efficiency are qualities that
encourage investors to place their faith
and money into a company. It's difficult
to quantify Facebook's progress and
success rates, yet Goldman Sachs found
enough value to invest $1.5 billion in the
company earlier this year, after having
determined the overall value of the site
to be in the $50 billion range.
Users are the blood of Facebook, and
connection is what they strive for. One
of the many things Facebook offers is'
information about other people's lives
at a speed and depth rarely paralleled.
In several interviews with University

students, the impetus to log on was the
same. It's good to connect with friends,
they said.
One of the major sellingpoints of Face-
book is that it's free. The site is so proud
of this fact that it's the first thing you see
on the homepage. Right under the head-
line, "Sign Up," Facebook assures you,
"It's free and always will be."
But as the saying goes: Nothing in this
life is free, especially if you are a student.
According to the University's finan-
cial services, tuition costs $5,824 per
semester for an in-state LSA freshman
and $17,906 for an out-of-state LSA
freshman.
In an average 15-credit schedule, stu-
dents spend roughly $388 per credit.
Divide that by the amount of weeks in
the semester -12 - and you find that
you're spending about $32 for each cred-
it hour or about 50 cents per minute you
sit in class. Triple it if you are an out-of-
state student.
In an online survey of 92 Facebook
users conducted by The Michigan Daily,
71 percent said they go on Facebook
while in class. Sixty-two percent said
they are only on for a few minutes, 10
percent said they are on for half an hour
and 7 percent said they are on Facebook

John Zehnptennig was
deployed to Iraq seven
months after his daugh-
ter was born.
Back in 2006, as the infant
was learning to crawl, talk
and walk, Zehnpfennig was
searching the grounds of a
war zone for explosive devic-
es to disarm.
Five years later, the
33-year-old Zehnpfennig - a
captain in the United States
Army Corps of Engineers -
finds himself in very differ-
ent territory as he pursues
a master's degree in electri-
cal engineering at the Uni-
versity. The transition from
active duty to academia was
one that Zehnpfennig said he
made for the sake of his fam-
ily. Since marrying his wife
Becky in 2004, Zehnpfen-
nig has had two children -
5-year-old daughter Haley
and 2-year-old son Joda - in
addition to helping raise his
11-year-old stepson Brendan.
As Zehnpfennig pointed out,
the alternative to his current
academic track would have
been continued military ser-
vice - a job filled with risks,
uncertainties and, worst of
all, separation from his fam-
ily.
Zehnpfennig said he
knew what he was getting
into when he enrolled as
an undergraduate at West
Point. He realized the dan-
gers attached to joining the
army and the prospect of
being deployed to a war zone
at any moment. Zehnpfennig
said when he got the call to
deploy to Iraq seven months
after the birth of his daugh-

ter, he was given less than a
week's notice to get ready to
ship off. For Zehnpfennig,
leaving his infant daughter
was especially difficult.
"That was the hardest
part," he said. "I left and
she wasn't crawling yet,
and when I got back she
was walking and talking. I
missed all those major devel-
opmental stages."
By the time Zehnpfennig
enrolled at the University
- becoming what he called
a "grandpa of the grad stu-
dents" - his wife had given
birth to their son Joda.
Zehnpfennig said it was a
difficult time. Not only was
he adjusting to a new place
and an expanded family, but
he was reentering school.
Additionally, because Becky
works fulltime as a nurse, the
couple had to find daycare
for their two young children.
They enrolled Haley at
the University's Northwood
Community Child Develop-
ment Center - a program
Zehnpfennig said helped
relieve some of the burden of
parenting.
Nevertheless, Zehnpfen-
nig said balancing school-
work and parenthood is still
cumbersome.
"I'm up with Joda at 5:30
every day, playing with him
non-stop and making him
breakfast," Zehnpfennig
said. "Then my daughter will
get up."
From there, it's into the
shower and into the car -
Joda needs to be at daycare
by 8:30 a.m.
Zehnpfennig then makes

his way down to Central
Campus for his first class,
which starts at 9 a.m.
"If it weren't for Michi-
gan time, I would be late for
class every day," Zehnpfen-
nig said.
After class, Zehnpfen-
nig is off to the lab to do
research. Since starting at
the University, Zehnpfennig
said he has had two academ-
ic papers published and hasa
third under review.
After doing research and
attending classes until 5
p.m., Zehnpfennig gets in the
car to pick up his kids from
daycare.
"Around 5 p.m. it's like
Fred Flintstone riding down
the brontosaurus. I had to
run over and get my daughter
... then I have to go to Dexter
to get my other kid," he said.
With the kids in the car,
they head home so Zehnpfen-
nig can cook dinner and give
them baths. Becky usually
doesn't get home before mid-
night.
"When it comes to the
other grad students, they're
like, 'Wow, I can't believe
you have kids (and) you're
researching,"' Zehnpfennig
said.
Though Zehnpfennig said
his colleagues are mostly
supportive and understand-
ing, there are times when he
feels like his life as a parent
isn't considered.
One time, Zehnpfennig's
daughter was sick and had to
be admitted to the Universi-
ty hospital. Because Haley's
illness happened to coin-
cide with the exam period,

Zehnpfennig asked his pro-
fessors for retakes, but one
of his professors denied his
request.
So on the third day his
daughter was in the hospital,
Zehnpfennig took the exam
with the rest of the class. He
aced it.
Despite its difficulties,
Zehnpfennig said he's appre-
ciated his time balancing
parenthood and being a stu-
dent and has been grateful
for the opportunities the
University offers.
"The big payoff is that I
get to spend time with the
kids, and they'll also see that
there's importance in educa-
tion," Zehnpfennig said.
Despite his desire to set-
tle down with his family,
Zehnpfennig feels the pros-
pect of deployment constant-
ly looming over him.
According to Zehnpfen-
nig, if he gets anything less
than a B- at the Univer-
sity, he'll immediately be
deployed for 18 months. If he
fails an army-administered
fitness test, it's the same
consequence - immediate
deployment. But Zehnpfen-
nig is determined to avoid
this, because though he's
committed to service, he
doesn't want that service to
take him away from his fam-
ily again.
His commitment is to fol-
lowing the "academic track"
- a career trajectory that
won't include impromptu
trips to war zones.
"I. chose this path so I
could be with my family,"
Zehnpfennig said.

Nicole Morack met her boyfriend during
her freshman year at the University,
when they both worked in the Bursley
dining hall. They gradually fell into a
serious and committed relationship.
Seven months later Morack was pregnant -
but it wasn't something they had planned on.
It was the start of her sophomore year, and she
was 19.
Morack gave birth to her daughter Jenni-
fer in July 2007, the summer after her sopho-
more year. Jennifer is now 3.5 years old and
attends a University-sponsored daycare pro-
gram while her mother - who graduated
from LSA in 2009 with a degree in sociology
- pursues a master's degree in the School of
Social Work, from which she expects to grad-
uate this spring.
When she found out she was pregnant,
it came as a huge shock to her and her boy-
friend, Morack said.
Luckily, Morack said she felt close enough to
her boyfriend to tell him the news immediately
and not withhold any of her complex feelings.
"We were comfortable with each other,"
Morack said of their relationship, which had
been going on for eight months when she got
pregnant.
Morack said their easy rapport enabled them
to have an honest and forthright conversation
about her pregnancy.
"There was conversation about what to do
about it," Morack said. "There was some decid-
ing back and forth about if we were actually
going to keep her."

Ultimately, as Morack put it, they decided to
keep her and "work around it."
Though they reached a decision together,
they knew that working around the pregnancy
wouldn't be easy - especially for Morack.
"I was finally getting into the swing of col-
lege ... and then I had to grapple with being
pregnant," Morack said.
It was not news her family greeted warmly.
Morack said it was difficult for her mother, who
took several months to get used to the idea of
her daughter being an expectant mother.
"My mom was pretty shocked and upset,"
Morack said, adding that she eventually came
around when Morack's pregnancy began to
show.
As she worked to garner the support of her
mother, Morack was also facing an equally
daunting task - how to continue with school.
Morack said dropping out or postponing her
education was never an option.
"I knew I just wanted to continue on because
getting my masters in social work was my plan
all along," Morack said.
According to Morack, her professors and
GSIs were understanding during the first
months of her pregnancy. If there was a class
she couldn't attend or a paper she missed,
Morack said her teachers would find a way to
accommodate her.
"I talked to a couple of GSIs and let them
know about the situation, and they were sup-
portive," Morack said.
As Morack's pregnancy became more vis-
ible, she said she noticed a difference in the
happen until after the presenta-
tion was over.
"I actually had to go to the hospital three
hours after I was done with my presentation,"
John said.
Since giving birth to her daughter Tara in
July, life couldn't be more hectic for John as

way she was treated. People in j
the hall would either stop and
stare or conspicuously avoid looking at her.
Morack sensed that people were talking about
her behind her back, but never approached her.
Morack added that her Resident Advisor
came up to her and acknowledged her pregnan-
cy - but it wasn't until March, toward the very
end of her second trimester.
"She came up to me and said, 'Oh, just so you
know, I noticed and some other girls in the hall
noticed that you're pregnant,' " Morack said
with a laugh.
But Morack said that being pregnant was
easy compared to actually having the baby.
Morack gave birth to Jennifer with her
boyfriend and family byher side. After couple
months of resting at home, Morack prepared to
reenter the University - this time with a baby
on board.
Morack and her boyfriend moved into
Northwood Apartments on North Campus in
an apartment unit designed for family housing.
"It was definitely strange to get used to it
being just me, (my boyfriend) and the baby,"
Morack said.
Because they didn't want to enroll their
two-month-old in daycare, Morack and her
boyfriend planned their academic schedules so
that one of them would be with Jennifer at all
times.
While the time with her daughter was grati-
fying, it also took a physical and emotional toll.
"On the days I wasn't in class I would basi-
cally just hang out with her," Morack said. "I
she balances classes, group work, her impend-
ing graduation and motherhood - not to men-
tion finding a job.
Nevertheless, John said she's optimistic
about her life and future, despite its daunting
nature.
"I know what I'm capable of doing," John

didn't get much sleep because she would be up
at night. It's like having two full-time jobs."
Because she had to focus on academics and
parenthood, Morack said she missed out on
many basic student activities, like going to par-
ties and making friends in the classroom.
"I didn'treally grow my social group on cam-
pus," Morack said of her time as an undergrad-
uate. "It was really weird to be like, 'Uh, I have
a kid, I can't really hang out."
Now that she's a graduate student, how-
ever, Morack said she's found and befriended
a group of fellow students who also have chil-
dren - and these people have provided a firm
network of support.
"Being in grad school and being involved
in different parent groups ... has been really
great," Morack said.
In graduate school, Morack said she wasn't
just "the girl with the kid" anymore.
Morack said having a daughter at the Uni-
versity has been an illuminating experience
and one that's fundamentally shaped her time
as an undergraduate and graduate student. *
Looking to the future, Morack said she'd
like to find a way to apply her social work
degree to low-income families and child-
care - a career choice influenced by having
a child.
."I've always had the interest of working
with families, but I've had an interest more
in early childhood as a result of having my
daughter," Morack said.
said. "I know how much I can multi-task while
still remainingsuccessful at the things that are
most important to me."
According to John, the past few years of her
life have been an extended exercise in effective
multitasking.
