Gov. Snyder signs
bill before MERC
hearing yesterday
By RAYZA GOLDSMITH
Daily NewsEditor
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
signed legislation yesterday that
bans unionization by gradu-
ate student research assistants,
halting the year-long fight that
sharply divided campus over
how GSRAs should be legally
classified.
The bill, which became effec-
tive immediately, states GSRAs
cannot be considered public
employees and are ineligible
for collective bargaining rights.
The legislation was introduced
by state Senate Majority Leader
Randy Richardville (R-Mon-
roe) about a month ago and was
recently passed in the state Sen-
ate and House of Representatives
before reaching Snyder's desk.
Snyder signed the bill into law
the same day that the Michigan
Employment Relations Commis-
sion was set to meet and poten-
tially make a decision about
whether or not GSRAs are con-
sidered public employees.
Snyder spokesman Ken Silfven
said the law is important to dis-
tinguish the difference between

students and employees.
"It's important to protect the
relationship between students
and teachers," Silfven said.
"I think having grad student
research assistants unionize
could complicate that relation-
ship ... Students need to be free
to continue learning and doing
their valuable research."
Senate Minority Leader
Gretchen Whitmer (D-East
Lansing) said she was frustrated
with the way the Republicans in
the legislature passed the legisla-
tion.
"I'm very disappointed that
the Governor signed it into law,"
Whitmer said. "This is about
working students' rights to col-
lectively bargain, and what we've
seen out of the Republicans over
the last 14 months is if you can't
win by the rules that are on the
books, then you just change the
rules. Itcomes at the cost of these
working students."
Richardville did not return
multiple phone calls requesting
comment.
Though the bill took immedi-
ate effect, MERC proceeded with
yesterday's meeting, according to
Ruthanne Okun, director of the
Michigan Bureau of Employment
Relations. Okun said MERC will
decide at its next meeting or dur-
ing a special meeting whether or

After five months of planning,
the University unrolled the first
phase in its NextGen Collabo-

ration Project with Google last
week, officiallytransferring cur-
rent e-mail services to Univer-

Bill Wrobleski, director of

currently, students are the only

CSG candidates
to spar over issues
tomorrow, Friday
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
At last night's Central Stu-
dent Government assembly
meeting, representatives pre-
pared for a busy week that
includes presidential debates,
the launch of a new website
and St. Patrick's Day festivi-
ties.
Law student Peter Borock,
CSG election director,
addressed the assembly about
the upcoming presidential
debates this tomorrow eve-
ning and Friday morning. The
events will dedicate a little
more than an hour for the
presidential and vice presiden-
tial to discuss their platforms.
Though the event will not fea-
ture rebuttals, the six presi-
dential and vice presidential
candidates will give opening
statements and respond to six
questions, he said. During the
meeting, members also dis-
cussed resolutions involving
funding and a waste-free ini-
tiative at Michigan Stadium.
CSG President DeAndree

Watson said the debate will
allow students to take a deeper
look at this year's candidates.
"This is not just a popular-
ity contest with name recogni-
tion," Watson said. "Students
have the opportunity to come
in and explore the platforms
and the ideas and personalities
of the people that are vying to
be their student government
leader."
Watson added that he was
excited about the wide range
of candidates running this
March.
"They all have some fantas-
tic ideas and I'm really proud
to see that," Watson said. "I'm
just excited that there are so
many people who are willing
to serve the student body as
well."
Thursday's debate will be
held at 7 p.m. tomorrow in
Auditorium B of Angell Hall,
and Friday's debate will be
held for WOLV-TV.
LSA senior Alys Alley, chief
programming officer of CSG,
also spoke to the assembly
about CSG's planned festivi-
ties for St. Patrick's Day this
Saturday that will serve as an
alternative to drinking. Alley
said she expects more than

for Gingrich to
drop out
LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) -
Rick Santorum crowed that
yesterday's primary victories in
8 3 Alabama and Mississippi were a
sign that conservatives had not
9 3 4 2 lost their sway in picking the
Republican presidential nomi-
4 5 3 6 nee and urged them to come
together behind his scrappy
challenge to front-runner Mitt
7 5 9 Romney.
Santorum told supporters
9 2 that results in those two states
again showed problems for
T 8Romney, the former Massachu-
I8setts governor who began -
and was likely to end - the day
9 2 leading in delegates and orga-
nization. Santorum aides hoped
1 4 6 7 9 Newt Gingrich's weak showing
in what was once seen as his
51regional stronghold would has-
5 I I 1ten his exit even as they strug-
gled on how to nudge him to end
his effort.
"We did it again," Santorum
said to cheers in Lafayette, La.,

Santorum speaks at his election night party last night in Lafayette, La.
1m tops Romney, sweeps
ippi, Alaba-ma primaries

where he was campaigning
ahead of the state's nominating
contest on March 24.
Santorum planned a late-
evening flight with his family to
Puerto Rico, where he was set to
campaign for two days with an
eye on its Sunday primary. His
quest to find as many delegates
as possible - and as cheaply as
he could - sent him after a share
of the U.S. territory's 23 del-
egates.
"We're going to spend two
days campaigning in Puerto Rico
because we want to make sure
everyone knows we are cam-
paigning everywhere there are
delegates because we are going
to win this nomination before the
convention," Santorum said in a
subtle jab at Gingrich, whose only
two wins so far have been in the
South.
Romney is on pace to reach the
1,144 delegates needed to clinch
the nomination in June. But
Santorum has argued that the
GOP race is not yet over and his
advisers suggest the party could
head to its August nominating
convention without a candidate
with that sum. In that scenar-

io, conservatives may push for
defections and deals that could
potentially yield a Santorum
nomination.
That strategy counts on every-
thing going right for Santorum,
but it was expected to be tough.
Illinois' March 20 primary could
yield Santorum asliceofdelegates
from rural areas, but Romney
was expected to flex his political
muscle there for a victory.
Louisiana follows on March
24 and could be Gingrich's final
effort to win in the South. San-
torum's campaign gets easier if
Gingrich bows out before then,
embarrassed by losing in states
that his aides once declared
must-win contests. Yet Gingrich
told supporters yesterday night
he wasn't quitting.
"We assume that Newt Gin-
grich will become less of a factor
in terms of vote totals in races
after the Louisiana primary, if
not before," Santorum strategist
John Patrick Yob said in a memo.
Santorum's team has had
trouble in how it would publicly
push Gingrich to depart.
Santorum communications
director Hogan Gidley said "we

didn't call on him to get in the
race and we won't call for him
to get out." But press secretary
Alice Stewart, when asked if
it was time for Gingrich to go,
responded, "Absolutely."
"Being a son of the South, he
should be doing much better
than this. But these numbers
just indicate that Rick Santorum
is the conservative in this race,"
Stewart told CNN.
The muddled message did lit-
tle to change Gingrich's embar-
rassment or Romney's continued
strength.
"For someone who thinks this
race is inevitable, he's spent a
whole lot of money against me
for being inevitable," Santorum
said, crediting his supporters
for keeping his ragtag campaign *
afloat despite massive spend-
ing by Romney and his allies on
negative ads.
"Ordinary folks from across
the country defy the odds day in,
day out," he said.
Looking further ahead, Santo-
rum aides say they will compete
for delegates - not necessarily
victories - in New York, Con-
necticut, Rhode Island and Dela-

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
New plan gives
city more power
State officials aiming to put
cash-strapped Detroit on a strict
financial diet delivered an ulti-
matum yesterday with a plan to
shift political power, consolidate
public utilities and shrink city
staff and salaries.
Detroit is facing cash flow
problems and a $197 million bud-
get deficit. A state review team
has already been digging into its
troubled finances, and the gover-
nor could appoint an emergency
manager.
City officials would save face
and preserve some local control
by agreeing to the state's plan,
but if they contest the terms or
fail to meet them, an emergency
manager could still be appoint-
ed. Republican Gov. Rick Snyder,
who approved the deal offered to
the city, has said he would prefer
to avoid that.

29-year-old Sultan Kosen of Tur-
key is listed in the 2011 Guinness
World Records at the tallest liv-

Kosen visited U.Va. in May
2010 for treatment for a disor-

" usually caused by a tumor in the

DAYTON, Ohio
Hoops diplomacy

Basketball fan-in-chief Presi-
dent Barack Obama gave British
Prime Minister David Cameron a
front-row seat to March Madness
yesterday, taking his European
partner to an election swingstate
for an NCAA tournament basket-
ball game.
The two leaders sat near one
end of the court at the Univer-
sity of Dayton Arena for a "First
Four" matchup between Missis-
sippi Valley State and Western
Kentucky, a gesture of goodwill
during Cameron's official visit to
the United States and a way for
an incumbent president to reach
sports fans in an election year.
The setting created the image
of two buddies, dressed in casu-
al clothes, eating hot dogs and
enjoying the NCAA tournament,
one of America's premier sport-
ing events.
Cameron, who enjoys tennis
and cricket buthad never beento a
basketball game before, said dur-
inga halftime interview on truTV
that Obama was "giving me some
tips. He's going to help me fill out

my (NCAA tournament) bracket."
Obama replied, "And he's goingto
teach me cricket."
GENEVA, Switzerland
French surgeon
calls Syria "hell"
French surgeon Jacques Beres
has operated in war zones for 40
years, but he says the carnage in
Syria is among the most horrific
he has ever witnessed.
Beres smuggled himself into
the battered Syrian city of Homs
for two weeks in February, setting
up a makeshift hospital in a home
where he operated on 89 wounded
in a span of 12 days. Many were
elderly or children. He saved most
of them, but nine died on the oper-
ating table.
At a meeting of human rights
activists yesterday in Geneva, the
71-year-old Parisian - apparently
the only Western doctor to get into
Homs - spoke with passion about
the bloodshed and the horrific
conditions.
"This is a hell," said Beres, a
co-founded of Doctors Without
Borders and Doctors of the World
who has worked in war zones
including Vietnam, Rwanda and
Iraq. "It's mass murder. It's totally
unfair. It's unjustifiable."

Joseph Kony's rebel war and
restore (Lord's Resistance Army-
affected) communities in Ugan-
da and other Central African
nations to peace and prosperity."
The campaign identifies Kony as
"the world'saworst war criminal."
The rapid spread of Invis-
ible Children's online message
allowed viewers of the 30-min-
ute film to simultaneously post,
share and tweet about Kony
2012, initiating heated debate
among supporters and critics,
while providing an open forum
for discussion.
Despite the campaign's viral-
ity, it's received criticism for the
lack of information provided in
the film, the organization's use of
donations and the timeliness of
the campaign.
Omolade Adunbi, assistant
professor in the Department
of Afroamerican and African
Studies, said he appreciates the
efforts made by Invisible Chil-
dren, but does not agree with
their presentation of the crisis in
Africa.
"It's a good thing that (Invis-
ible Children) is bringing
attention to what is going on
in Uganda, but the way it has
been presented (makes it seem)
as if it is something new, but it
has been around for 26 years,"
Adunbi said. "Many efforts have
(already) been made to bring
attention to the crisis, so theysare
not the first set of people to bring
attention to this case."
He added that the com-
plexities of the conflicts in
Uganda and the surrounding
African nations make it difficult
to assume that capturing Kony
and bringing him to justice will
resolve them.
"Taking out Kony is not going
to solve the problem ... They need
to be able to find a lasting solu-
tion to the varying problems
confronting the region," Adunbi
said. "This will mean bringing
everyone to the table to discuss
this problem, not only the Ugan-
dan state, but also the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo,
Rwanda and Sudan."

not the body has jurisdiction over
the GSRA issue now that the law
has barred GSRAs from union-

Rackham student Liz
Rodrigues, communications
chair for the Graduate Employ-

new law effectively eliminates
MERC's role in changing the sta-
tus of GSRAs from students to

"As of right now, this bill
means that the GSRA campaign
is ending in a legal attack on
GSRAs' right to vote, rather than
in a fair election," Rodrigues said.
"It does mean that the campaign

Rackham student Stephen

he is extremely pleased with the
new law.
"We feel thatwe can relax alit-

the knowledge that this union
won't be trying to absorb us, that
we can go on with the process
of being students," Raiman said.

Choi said. "Kony is simply a1

in helping the Central African
communities gain peace; a quite
ambitious goal, but definitely
worth the struggle."
Choi acknowledged that the]
organization's video relies heav-
ily on emotional persuasion to1
catch the viewer's attention, but
said ultimately it's impactful
in conveying the dire situation
afflicting thousands of citizens.i
"(The video is a) complete
appeal to your emotions, rather
than your mind, but that's what
truly gets to us in the end -
the gut feeling of what's right
and what's wrong," Choi said.
"They've finally incited debates
among the general population,
including the youth, about their
cause."
Business freshman Alim
Leung said she originally sup-
ported the Kony 2012 campaign
after watching the video, but
after further research, changed
her opinion about the organiza-
tion and its efforts.
"Initially I was 100 percent
for (Kony 2012)," Leung said.
"(After) actually taking a step
back and thinking about it for a
minute and also researching it
I can't bring myself to support
Invisible Children."
She said she believes the

to GSRAs, the ramifications of
the bill could extend beyond just
them, and many see the end of
this battle as the beginning of a
bigger discussion about collective
bargaining rights in the state.
Jeff Hauser, political media
lead for the AFL-CIO, said Mich-
igan could see more bills emerge
from the legislature attempting
to limit the power of unions.
"This totally is a national
effort, and it may seem counter-
intuitive that what's happening
at the University of Michigan
(is national, but it's really not),"
Hauser said. " ... I'm not saying
what's happening at the Uni-
versity of Michigan is the focal
point of their efforts, but it's a
part of their game plan."
Hauser said he has heard
talk of legislators in the state
attempting to further limit col-
lective bargaining rights and
a number of bills have already
been introduced. He said the
reason there hasn't been a com-
plete overhaul of unionization
rights in the state thus far is
that that such attempts are very
unpopular, so Snyder has tried to
distance himself from such wide
scale efforts.
Silfven agreed that labor
issues have not been a priority
for the governor.
"Every bill has to be looked at
on its own merit, but I think all
in all, the governor has been very

we really wanted to rebrand
things and use this as an oppor-
tunity to re-implement the web-
site - make it really as great as
it could be."
A resolution to support
making Michigan Stadium
a "zero-waste" stadium was
also introduced at the meet-
ing. Engineering junior Chris-
sie Zuchora, an Engineering
assembly representative and
co-author of the resolution, said
zero-waste means that close to
everything sold at the stadium
would be able to be composted
or recycled.
"Other campuses, including
Ohio State, have already started
doing this effort," Zuchora said.
"There's just too much that goes
to waste from our campus and
especially from the stadium."
United States should support
assistance to these struggling
countries, including potentially
taking more drastic interference.
"What we should do now is
support the activists out there
who have already been working
really, really hard," Leung said.
"Maybe U.S. intervention might
be needed, but at the same time,
we don't want to go to that as a
last resort because it might do
more harm than good."
She added that she thinks the
campaign's approach is too sim-
plistic and inaccurately suggests
that arresting Kony will termi-
nate the conflict. However, she
said she likes that the campaign
provides viewers with ways to
become active in their commu-
nity.
"I'm really happy that a lot of
people are for (Kony 2012) and
getting active about doing some-
thing in their community and
globally," she said. "I just hope
that people take a lesson from
this and actually do the research
and take this energy and drive
and push it towards something
that could really make a differ-
ence."
Engineering junior Arjun
Mahajan said he supports Invis-
ible Children and Kony 2012
because of the group's determi-
nation to create global aware-
ness about conflicts in Africa.
"I know that there is a lot
of criticism (toward Invisible
Children), but I think one of the
most important things that they
promote is awareness ... That is
their number one goal," Mahajan
said. "Change isn't going to hap-
pen solely because of one per-
son or a group of people. I think
that they are trying to gather as
many people to get government
officials involved. I think that's
worthwhile."
Invisible Children will host
a nationwide Cover the Night
event on April 20, in which Kony
2012 participants will further
publicize the campaign by hang-
ing posters and distributing
campaign materials in support of
the Kony 2012 movement. Maha-
jan said he plans to take part.
"(My hall and I) have been
talking about this for the past
week, and we've decided that
we're going to support this as a
whole," Mahajan said.

consistent in saying that col-
lective bargaining has worked
well in Michigan and dealing
with those issues," Silfven said.
"It's not something that's on his
agenda."
Nevertheless, some believe
Michigan could face the drawn
out battles over collective
bargaining rights that other
Midwestern states, such as Wis-
consin, Indiana and Ohio, have
faced in the past year and a half.
"I think that that's a very
legitimate concern," Whitmer
said. "As we watch what hap-
pens with (Wisconsin Gov.)
Scott Walker or what happens
with the worker protection bal-
lot language. I'm hopeful a year
from now Michigan gives our
workers the ability to collective-
ly bargain, but it could be dra-
matically different, too."
Hauser said it would make
sense for the issue of workers'
rights to become prominent in
Michigan, an important state for
the labor movement, especially
at a time when conservatives
have control over the Legisla-
ture.
"These are states in which the
opportunity for right-wingers
to push through unpopular leg-
islation (is small)," Hauser said.
"It's a narrow window and they
are acting with great swiftness
to implement their agenda."
There is already evidence of a

versity Google account, accord-
ing to Wrobleski. However,
despite the 5,000 students who
have migrated their data so far,
he said he didn't think many
more students would complete
the transfer soon.
"We expect a lot of the stu-
dents aren't using the current U
of M system or if they are, they
want to start fresh with their
Google system," Wrobleski said.
Wrobleski said he is excited
about the potential of the new
partnership with Google because
it provides enhanced sharing
between users. He said class lists
eventually will be available on
Google servers for classmates to
access, allowing them to collabo-
rate on documents, e-mails and
other resources without the need
to know other users' uniqnames
or e-mail addresses.
"People can share and col-
laborate with work," Wrobleski
said. "Not just in Ann Arbor or
around the University campus,
but for research colleges around
the country."
Despite a smooth migration
process, Wrobleski added that
one difficulty with the project
is encouraging the University
community to adopt Google. He
said his team has been using a
significant amount of advertis-
ing to raise awareness about the
project.
"Some things have gone really
well and some things are more
challenging," Wrobleski said. "It
is always challenging to imple-
ment change on a campus of
100,000 people."
Rita Girardi, marketing
communications specialist for
NextGen Michigan, said most
students are experiencing a
smooth transition. She said the
help center designed to aid with
the transition has had about 100

University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald wrote in an e-mail
interview that though the Uni-
versity is proud of this year's
rankings, such standings should
not be the only factor in choosing
a graduate school.
"The University is always
pleased to be ranked highly,"
Fitzgerald wrote. "But it is
important to note that rank-
ings aren't always the best way
to measure the quality of a uni-
versity or the best way to pick a
school."
According to the U.S. News &
World Report website, the pur-
pose of the rankings is to pro-
vide prospective graduate school

fight gearing up over labor laws
in the state. GEO, along with a
number of other unions in Mich-
igan, have launched a campaign
to put a constitutional amend-
ment on the ballot in November
that would, among other things,
ensure that Michigan does not
become a 'right to work' state -
meaning employees can choose
not to pay union dues.
"We're really upset that the
campaign is ending that way,"
Rodrigues said. "But we see it
as good timing in the sense that
we're now able to transition
into this bigger fight to protect
collective bargaining rights,
because so far it's just been
attacks from groups that are
against workers' rights ... we're
going on the offensive, which is
nice."
Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said Michigan has
already seen the introduction of
a number of anti-union bills.
"That's not surprising," Irwin
said. "The Republicans made
it clear that they were going
to go after who they saw as
political enemies, and unions
usually hand their support to
Democrats."
Hauser said if Michigan is
anything like other conservative
state legislatures, it could see
the introduction of even more
anti-labor legislation.
"I think that there's a general

calls a day, and there is extensive
help information on the project
website.
"The challenge is bringing it
up on their radar so that when
(problems do) happen, they are
not blindsided by it," Girardi
said. "It is challenging to do that
too, to get people to read e-mails
and the communications."
Wrobleski said he hopes all
studentswould take advantage of
the apps offered by Google, even
if they continue to forward their
University e-mail to their per-
sonal e-mail accounts. He said he
thinks that it will become more
widely used in the classroom,
and eventually students will
want to adopt their new Univer-
sity Google account in order to
better work with each other.
LSA junior Sabrina Palombo
said she has always used Google
apps and e-mail for her classes
because she enjoys the function-
ality and adopted the new system
early.
"I like Gmail, I like the inter-
face," Palombo said.
However, Palombo said she
initially had problems with her
conflicting University and per-
sonal Google accounts, but found
help on the project website and
quickly resolved the issue.
LSA sophomore Chaturi Wije-
sundera said she uses Google
apps extensively already.
"I use them for everything,"
Wijesundera said.
Wijesundera added that
because of her existing person-
al account, she has no plans to
migrate over to the new Univer-
sity system. She added that she
hasn't logged into her University
e-mail account since she set it up
to forward to her personal Gmail
account.

Rankings are released annu-
ally and are based on factors
including peer assessment,
recruiter assessment, research
activity, average starting salary,
employment rate and entrance
test scores, such as the GRE,
LSAT or MCAT. Methodologies
on criteria, such as specialty pro-
grams, tend to vary year to year.
According to Fitzgerald,
the University has focused on
enhancing the student experi-
ence, instead of limiting their
scope of improvement to the con-
fines of ranking criteria.
"There are many factors that
go into what makes the best
place for an individual student to
attend," Fitzgerald wrote.
LSA junior Megan Pratt said
the improvement in rankings of
the School of Social Work has not
influenced her decision to apply
there for graduate school.
"I have always been planning
on applying because I am from
Michigan and know that U-M
has excellent social work gradu-
ate programs," Pratt said.

blueprint that gets tailored dis-
tinctly to different states to try
to erode collective bargaining
and to erode workers standing
together rather than workers
standing one by one," he said.
Whether or not a showdown
on labor rights in the state
ensues, it is clear there are deep
divisions on the GSRA issue
alone as expressed by state offi-
cials.
"It's disheartening to see
supposedly small government
Republicans come in and usurp
a constitutionally autonomous
university and its students and
the judicial process," Whitmer
said. " ... The legislators sub-
stituted their own supposed
wisdom for everyone else's judg-
ment and it flies in the face of all
their arguments about having
smaller government and I think
it's done a disservice to a lot of
different people on this issue
and a lot of others."
Silfven said this bill isn't
about unions at all, but rather
defining the responsibilities of
student researchers.
"This is really a pro-education
bill," he said. "It's not anti any-
thing, it's very pro-education.
Nothing should stand in the
way of these students continu-
ing their educations and mak-
ing outstanding contributions
in research to the University.
That's really the goal."

Ask their orientation
Question helps meet all students' needs
he University has the important responsibility of serving
every student as best as it can. To assess students' needs as
accurately as possible, students at the University of Califor-
nia, Los Angeles are suggesting that the university give students
the option to identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bi-sexual or trans-
gender on their intent to register form. Obtaining more informa-
tion about the size and needs of the LGBTQ community will allow
UCLA to better serve these students. A similar program should be
adopted on our own campus to learn more about and include this
group of students.

The Academic Senate at UCLA proposed
that a question be asked on the intent to regis-
ter form that gives students the option to dis-
close their sexual identity. The University of
California Board of Admissions and Relations
with Schools is currently debating the issue.
The data would be collected from incoming
freshmen and transfer students, but because
the question is optional, some students may
choose not to respond or to answer incorrect-
ly, slightly skewing results. However, many
students believe having incoming students
answer this question could provide valuable
information for the university.
Statistics that determine what percentage
of university students identify as LGBTQ are
limited and are usually not based on quantita-
tive data. Here at the University of Michigan
- and at most other colleges - estimates are
made as to what percentage of students iden-
tify as LGBTQ, but there is no way to support
these estimates. Many believe thatthe number
of LGBTQ students has been underestimated,
and finding out a more concrete percentage
would validate their cause. If a student feels
uncomfortable answering the question, they
will not be forced to do so.
Universities already ask students what race
they identify as, so asking students to identify
their sexual orientation would help serve the
needs of another minority group. Living and

learning communities for the LGBTQ com-
munity could be offered to create a safe envi-
ronment for these students, similar to African
American or science students' communities
offered at UCLA. More LGBTQ-friendly resi-
dence halls could be created as well. When
LGBTQ students enter college, they would
have the opportunity to meet with other stu-
dents like them and learn from their college
experiences if they desire.
The University should be commended for
providing accessible resources for LGBTQ
students. The University hosts the Spectrum
Center, which gives students the opportu-
nity to participate in open forums and receive
assistance as needed. All universities should
have resources like these in place to help stu-
dents become comfortable with their identi-
ties and provide help for them if needed.
It is essential that universities cater to
students' needs so that they receive the best
education and college experience as possible.
By including an optional question asking stu-
dents if they identify as LGBT, universities
would be better equipped with more accurate
data to provide essential resources for this
community. Identifying as LGBT will hope-
fully be viewed as simply a demographic ques-
tion, and if treated as such, the stigma that
surrounds the issue may be one step closer to
becoming obsolete.

You need something unusual to go your way."

need to take risks when crafting a successful March Madness bracket.

HEMA KARUNAKARAM I
Speak up for change

The ability to be an informed and active
member of campus affairs is a privilege I'm
glad to have. As an Engineering student and
a member of several student organizations,
I certainly care deeply about how things are
run at the University, be it in my department,
within my organizations or as a whole. But
I've found that many students across campus,
regardless of their background or involve-
ment, remain apathetic about campus affairs.
And I've never been too sure of why that is.
Last week, I had the pleasure of attending
a panel discussion hosted by the University's
Engineering Council - the College of Engi-
neering's student government - that talked
about student activism. Among the panelists
were DeAndree Watson and Brendan Camp-
bell, current president and vice president of
Central Student Government. Prompted by
my general feeling of dissatisfaction with
student involvement, I asked them about
how they can get people to care w issues on
campus, or at least care enough to vote and
to think they have an impact. While I didn't
necessarily get a straight answer, I was defi-
nitely motivated by Watson's response that
what made him personally care was simply
recognizing the idea that "this University
belongs to me" - and he's right. The Univer-
sity doesn't just belong to the state, the Board
of Regents or the administrators. It belongs to
the 40,000 students that pay tuition here, and
that should be enough to recognize that the
opinions of students certainly matter.
Campbell shared a story about how CSG
recently received an e-mail that there were no
efficient water fountains in the Shapiro Under-
graduate Library. It seems trivial, but the fact
that someone cared enough about something
to reach out to someone who might be able to
change it shows what power we each have as
students. In fact, plans are already underway

to replace those water fountains - proving that
a student governing body can make real things
happen.
Inspired, I decided to test this concept out
myself. I've had issues all year with being
able to shower in my residence hall. It seems
that every set of showers available to me is
always being cleaned right when I want to use
them. And sure, maybe I have a weird show-
ering schedule, but my personal preferences
shouldn't hinder my ability to take a shower.
So a few days ago, I decided to take my issue
directly to a residence hall administrator, not
really expecting anything. To my pleasant
surprise, I received a thoughtful and prompt
response, and was told that facilities staff had
been notified of my issue and steps were being
taken to stagger cleaning schedules such that at
least one set of showers would always be avail-
able to all residents.
Maybe this doesn't seem like much. Maybe
the kid in the UGLi and I were just lucky that
our concerns were not only heard but also
acted upon. But I'd like to think that this is the
kind of thing that makes the University great.
Faculty, administrators and student govern-
ment representatives are in their positions
because they care. If you have a problem, take
it to someone whose job it is to listen. People
may insist on advocating for "letting students'
voices be heard" or "giving a voice to those who
have none" but the truth is, every student does
have a voice. And there is someone out there
who wants to hear it.
The University is mine just as much as it is
yours, your professors', your student govern-
ment representatives' and your administra-
tors.' So if you have something to say, just say
it. Because someone's always listening.
Hema Karunakaram is an
Engineering sophomore.

Two years ago, I was at the spring commencement
where President Barack Obama spoke. Even though
I was in high school, I was excited at the prospect of
seeing Obama at such an important event. How many
chances do you get to see a president give a commence-
ment address? Especially a president who is famous for
his uplifting and hope-inducing speeches. I waited in
the rain that day, went to the upper reaches of the Big
House, and then the president began to speak. To this
day, I can't remember what he spoke about, but all I
know was that I was not uplifted at all. My sister, who
was a graduate that day, said she appreciated the mes-
sage. But she, too, was left unsatisfied. Where was the
hope that Obama promised?
It has been almost 20 years since Sanjay Gupta was
a student here at the University. That's a long time. I
haven't even been alive for that long. Gupta is a Michi-
gan original. He completed his high school education
at nearby Novi High School, his undergraduate degree,
his M.D. and he even finished his residency here in Ann
Arbor. Currently, he's the chief medical correspondent
at CNN, hosting his own show entitled "Sanjay Gupta,
M.D.," and is a highly respected neurosurgeon at Grady
Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, where he also serves on
the staff of the Emory University Medical School. This
commencement speaker is, as Mary Sue Coleman said,
a reminder of the potential that the Michigan degree
gives each and every one of us.
Due to the economic downturn, it has been more
difficult in recent years for University graduates to get
jobs. Despite the fantastic education we receive here
in Ann Arbor, there just aren't enough opportunities
in the world today for all these students to get a posi-
tion. There's a decided gloom around students who have
graduated in recent years - so many have indetermi-
nate futures.
Enter Sanjay Gupta. Gupta represents the epitome of
the Michigan difference. He has ascended to the top of
his field, and even transcended it, making the shift to
reporting as easily as making a precise incision into gray
matter. As talented as he is, he made an extremely dif-
ficult transition seem relatively easy. I'm not suggest-
ing that every pre-med here at Michigan will become a
top reporter or an anchor for the most famous name in

news. But if the best the University can offer succeeded
so much, there's hope for the rest of us down below to
at least find a place in the world, however less glorious
it may be.
By selecting Gupta as the next commencement speak-
er, the University's Board of Regents project an image
of internal pride. After making a political statement the
past two years, with Obama in 2010 and Republican
Gov. Rick Snyder in 2011, the University is going back
to its roots. It selected a true Michigan Man, one born,
raised and educated within an hour of the Ann Arbor
campus. Who couldn't take pride in that?
I left the Big House on that rainy day in May the
same as I came in. Excited about junior prom, ner-
vous about upcoming AP tests and excited about hear-
ing Obama speak. I still remember that before Obama
himself came to the podium, there was a video display
of all the past presidential luminaries to come speak at
Michigan. Images of Gerald Ford during his time here
at the University flashed on the screen. John F. Ken-
nedy speaking on the steps of the Union, announcing his
plan for the Peace Corps during his 1960 campaign for
president, raised rousing applause. Lyndon B. Johnson,
detailing his desire for the Great Society, was met with
applause as well. George H.W. Bush didn't receive as
much applause as the others, but still carried with him a
feeling of awe. Bill and Hillary Clinton were among the
favorites in recent years. Even Kofi Annan was appreci-
ated by the crowd. I'm not saying Obama wasn't appre-
ciated. He just didn't have the same weight with him as
the others did. There was no feeling of awe, of unified
emotion, of pure hope that accompanied so many of
his other speeches. It felt as if he came to give a simple
speech, not to inspire the next generation of graduates
to something special.
I picked up The Michigan Daily on Monday, and
saw the headline announcing Gupta as commencement
speaker. I couldn't explain the feeling, but it wasn't even
just hope. It was something more. It was the same feel-
ing I had watching the presidents of the past speak at
Michigan.
Let's just hope Gupta meets the expectations.

Seniors reach NCAAs

ERINKIRKLAND/Daily
Forward Phil Di Giuseppe, one of eight freshmen on the Wolverine roster, has always had Berenson's blessing.
Berenson's patience with
freshmen pays dividends

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan hockey coach Red
Berenson doesn't recruit his
players based on skill alone.
Before he sends out scholarship
offers to potential Wolverines,
he asks his assistants - the ones
that do the bulk of the recruiting
- one simple question.
Can you see these guys play-
ing playoff hockey?
Berenson envisions an atmo-
sphere like the one last week-
end, when Michigan swept rival
Notre Dame in the quarterfinals
of the CCHA playoffs.
If Berenson's assistants can
imagine these amateur play-
ers playing in front of a raucous
crowd with postseason implica-
tions on the line, then they have
Berenson's full support.
Against Notre Dame, Beren-
son's vision came to life. With-
out prior knowledge of the team,
you wouldn't have been able to
tell the youngsters from the vet-
erans.
"I thought I was going to be
a little more nervous against
Notre Dame, to be honest, but I
was pretty calm," said freshman
forward Alex Guptill. "I really
enjoyed it and had a lot of fun
out there."
Playoff hockey is a completely
different animal than the regu-
lar season. The games have a dif-
ferent feel to them, and it can be
hard for freshmen to adjust to
the amped-up tempo. The key
phrase in that sentence is "can
be."

For the past two seasons, the
Michigan women's basketball
team watched Selection Monday
warily, uncertain of whether or
not it would receive a berth in
the NCAA Tournament's field
of 64.
On Monday, the Wolverines
were in the same situation. The
only difference was the result -
an 11-seed in the Fresno region,
finally a trip to dance.
The unfamiliar result from
previous years was a nice change
for the current group of seniors
- Michigan coach Kevin Bors-
eth's first recruiting class.
"I wish you could've been in
that room and seen the explosion
of happiness and tears," Borseth
said. "It's really been a long time
coming for our program - in
particular, our seniors, (who)
have worked so hard to get us
back in the NCAA Tournament."
The seniors, especially guards
Courtney Boylan and Carmen
Reynolds, have been so close
during the last two years to
achieving the goal they've had
since stepping foot in Ann Arbor,
only to fall just short.
But after their freshman year
- Borseth's second with Michi-
gan - the goal seemed out of
reach. The Wolverines posted a
10-20 record, which is still the
worst finish in Borseth's tenure.
Boylan and Reynolds have
become synonymous with the
system that Borseth put into
effect. He runs a motion-style
offense that allows the players to
make a lot of their own decisions
and shoot often. They are the
perfect model for this system, as
both players are above-average
3-point shooters but are more
than willing to bang around the
paint as well.
"It really is incredible just
thinking about everything that
we have been through as a team
over the past four years," Boylan
said. "Personally, all the work
that you put in and all the time
that you spent to make yourself
better and your team better."
Both players came in with
promise but started out slow
during their freshman year.
Reynolds didn't start a single
game during that campaign,
but still averaged 6.1 points per
game. But she has started every
single game (96) since the final

game of the 2008 season and
averaged a combined 10.4 points
per game during that span.
Reynolds capped an impres-
sive career this past season with
two impressive feats. First, she
reached 1,000 career points and
later set the all-time record for
3-pointers made. Both accom-
plishments speak volumes about
the consistency and production
Reynolds has shown throughout
her career at Michigan.
Boylan contributed during
her sophomore year, but she
really came into her own dur-
ing her junior campaign. Then-
sophomore guard Nya Jordan
was sidelined early in the sea-
son with a torn ACL, and Boylan
found herself in the starting
lineup as a result. Since her
debut as a consistent starter
against Iowa on Jan. 1 of last
year, she has scored 10.8 points
per game - 4.1 more than her
career average.
But along with their produc-
tion on the court, both players
have found themselves in leader-
ship roles. And because of their
leadership abilities, the rest of
the team, particularly junior
Jenny Ryan, felt a lot of pride as
Michigan was announced in the

tournament. The underclassmen
understand what the seniors
have been through to finally
achieve a goal that's been set
their entire careers.
"I think you could see ... their
happiness and their joy, and that
was probably one of the most
special moments for me," Ryan
said. "I was never really here
for the worst part of it, and they
were. I can only imagine what
that's like to see (Michigan) take
a complete 180 (degree turn). It
means alot for me and for them."
Boylan, Reynolds and fellow
senior Jamillya Hardley will
only get one trip to the ICAA
Tournament, but will always be
known as the group that brought
the Wolverines back to promi-
nence.
When Borseth recruited
them, he knew he was getting
good players, but probably not
that those players would totally
buy into his system and trans-
form a then-faltering program.
"Our program has changed so
much since coach Borseth came
here, and we were a part of his
(first) recruiting class," Boylan
said. "To be able to leave our
footprint on the program means
so much to us."

Most freshmen spend their
first year at Michigan adjusting
to a college lifestyle, meeting
new friends and navigating their
way through the campus.
Annette Miele and Sachi Sug-
iyama have been asked to do a
little more - uphold the legacy
of the Michigan women's gym-
nastics program.
In a season where injuries
have already ravaged their
senior-less team, the fresh-
man duo has stepped up at a
time when the team needs it
most. The pair's continued suc-
cess this year will be crucial in
helping the Wolverines raise
a sixth-consecutive Big Ten
Championship banner.
Miele, a native of Easton,
Penn., was recruited out of the
Parkettes National Gymnastics
Training Center. Before coming
to Michigan, she was a three-
time USA Visa Championship
qualifier and was named to the
U.S. Junior National Team in
2008. She made her collegiate
debut on the balance beam
against Ohio State, and she has
competed in the all-around
twice already this season.
"I knew I wanted to come
here once I stepped foot in this
gym," Miele said. "Right away,
I was like, 'This is where I want
to be.' Then I hung out with the
team after practice, and it all
just felt right. When I finally
committed, I was like, 'I'm going
to be a Michigan athlete.' It was
awesome."
Her partner-in-crime, Sugi-
yama, hails from Keller, Texas,
W where she trained at Top Flight
Gymnastics. In 2010, Sugiyama

placed sixth in the all-around
competition at the Junior Olym-
pic National Championships.
In her collegiate debut, she
tied for second in two of three
events against the Buckeyes.
Since then, Sugiyama has been
an all-arounder in all but one of
this season's competitions.
"It never struck me that my
scores would count so much and
they would depend on me as
much as they do during this sea-
son," Sugiyama said. "It's a good
feeling."
With only seven Wolverines
available to compete, the oppor-
tunity for the pair to shine pre-
sented itself early in the season.
A season-ending Achilles
tendon injury to junior Nata-
lie Beilstein and a recent ankle
injury to junior Brittnee Marti-
nez has forced the entire team
to strengthen its performance.
In particular, such injuries have
allowed Miele and Sugiyama to
showcase their talents in more
events.
Through injuries and inex-
perience, the freshmen's scores
have helped keep Michigan one
of the most competitive teams in
the nation.
"I definitely look at myself
and think, 'I have to step up',"
Miele said. "I know that I need
to work harder for my team,
because if we want to succeed
in the end, then every person
counts, including me."
The duo has been particularly
impressive lately, as its team
makes a final push before head-
ing into the postseason. Togeth-
er, they have shattered a total
of nine career-bests in the past
four weeks.
In a return to her home state,
Miele recorded two personal-

high scores on bars and beam,
and she finished the night with
her top all-around score of the
year. At the same meet against
Penn State, Sugiyama finished
with record scores on bars and
floor, along with a career best for
the all-around as well.
"Annette came in with a lit-
tle bit of a back problem, so she
started a little bit slower," said
Michigan coach Bev Plocki. "But
in the last couple of meets she
has been getting back to where
we need her to be.
"I think (Sachi) has steadi-
ly improved throughout the
season. She's getting more
confident, competing more
aggressively, and (she) has been
a really important part of our
season."
The two athletes have quickly
forged a powerful friendship as
they support each other on and
off the mats. Through similar
experiences, the freshmen have
bonded together while assisting
each other settle into their new
careers as collegiate student-

athletes. Miele and Sugiyama
both admit that they constantly
calm each other down before
and during competitons, which
helps hide their lack of experi-
ence.
"I wouldn't be able to be
the person I am today without
(Annette) supporting me every
step of the way," Sugiyama said.
"Since there's only two of us, we
just got so close. I can't imagine
being a freshman without her."
Both Miele and Sugiyama are
looking forward to contributing
to the team's postseason, and
they believe their team is good
enough to win another Big Ten
title and make their second-
consecutive appearance in the
NCAA's Super Six.
Beyond this season, though,
the future is bright for the duo.
Plocki is confident both Wol-
verines will be All-Americans
in their respective events one
day, but for now, the freshmen
have their eyes set on something
more important - champion-
ship rings.

Connections abound in Ohi

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
When Ohio's name popped up
on CBS's Selection Show in the
space below Michigan, Wolverine
fans came up with an abundance
of jokes surroundingthe irony of a
real Michigan-Ohio matchup.
Since Michigan football coach
Brady Hoke coined the term at
his introductory press confer-
ence, fans and even members of
the Wolverines' athletic depart-
ment - including Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon and basketball
coach John Beilein - have delib-
erately left the "State" out of the
school's name.
It even prompted a comment
from Bobcat men's basketball
coach John Groce.
"It is kind of disrespectful, but
it is what it is," Groce told USA
Today in February. "You can't
control what other people say.
You can only control what you're
doing on a daily basis. That's how
we operate here."
But the connections between
the Michigan and Ohio basketball
programs run deeper than a jab at
the Wolverines' rival.
The two programs have many
links, but perhaps none more
important - strategically speak-
ing - than Michigan assistant
coach Bacari Alexander.
Alexander spent one season,
2007-2008, as a Bobcat assistant.
He left Athens, Ohio, when Groce
replaced former head coach Tim
O'Shea.
Though none of the current
players on Ohio's roster were in
college when O'Shea departed,
Alexander moved on to coach at
Western Michigan. For two years,
as MAC rivals, Alexander's Bron-
cos dropped two of their three
games against the Bobcats.
But the experience of going
head-to-head against Groce and
Ohio will give Alexander, who
will likely handle game-planning
duties leading up to Friday, a leg
up.
Alexander's link isn't the only
connection among Michigan's
staff. As a head coach at Rich-
mond, Beilein coached against
conference foe Xavier, where
Groce was serving as an assis-
tant under current Ohio State
coach That Matta - one of
Groce's mentors.
Groce is also a friend of Michi-

Freshman guard Trey Burke turned down Michigan's first-round opponent, Ohio, to play in Ann Arbor. He'll face several clos

gan assistant Jeff Meyer. Both are
graduates of Taylor University,
and despite graduating 22 years
apart, each played basketball for
Taylor coach Paul Patterson.
And Groce's connections to
Michigan don't stop there. Dur-
ing the one year Groce spent as
an assistant at Butler in 2001,
Wolverine assistant LaVall Jor-
dan was an all-conference senior
guard for the Bulldogs.
Some Michigan players are
familiar with current Bobcats,
too.
Senior guard Zack Novak
remains close friends with red-
shirt junior guard Walter Offutt.
Offutt, who transferred to Ohio
from Ohio State, was an AAU
teammate of Novak on the Indi-
ana Elite.
Novak stays in regular com-
munication with Offutt, and

moments after finding out his
tournament fate, he texted his
friend.
"I actually congratulated him
when they won (the MAC Cham-
pionship) the other day - sent
him a text saying, 'Way to get
in,'" Novak said. "I already have
texted him since it came up (on
the Selection Show). We talked a
little bit."
Their pleasantries Sunday
evening began on a light mat-
ter - exchanging jokes from the
movie Talladega Nights - but
then things got down to busi-
ness.
"(I) just told him congrats,"
Novak said. "Personally, for him,
he's been through a lot. He's
gone through two knee surger-
ies, so I was just happy for him
that he got to experience that. I
just said, 'See you in Nashville

and let's get after it.'"
Freshman point guard Trey
Burke, an Ohio native, was heav-
ily recruited by Ohio, and early
in his high school career, he con-
sidered becoming a Bobcat. He
took an unofficial visit to Ath-
ens, where he became acquaint-
ed with several current Ohio
players, including Nick Kellogg
- the son of basketball analyst
Clark Kellog - and the Bobcats'
best player, DJ Cooper.
"I was considering them early
on in my recruiting process,"
Burke said. "The players were
cool. ... It was a nice campus. It
was much smaller than here, but
the coaches were cool."
He's also close friends with
Bobcat freshman point guard
Stevie Taylor, dating back to
their elementary-school days.
The two battled on the same

In the wake of this revolution,

co-directed by Spanish painter
Javier Mariscal, showcases why
drawings - composed and tied
together by an artist's hands- are
some of the most powerful modes
of expression. There is nothing

tale of a pianist and a singer who

Gregerson explained that
when Lepage's work features a
lone performer, there is never
a loss of expansive range. His
single-performer productions
are not narrowing, but rather
have a feeling of enlargement.
In this way, Lepage can focus on

therefore guiding the audience's
attention to those poignant
images.
"He's like Steven Spielberg

"He knows the wisdom and the

how powerful that can be. You

absolutely gets that."
Additionally, part of Lepage's
skill is his ability to make the
audience feel invited to the pro-
duction, something that may be
the key to his work's success.
"There's a foundational joy in
the performative that informs
his work," Gregerson said. "You
would think that goes without
saying, but in fact joy, is some-
thing that way too often goes
missing in stage work. Someone
who keeps it so central is some-
one to be really grateful for."

BALLROOM OF THE MICHIGAN LEAGUE

The abduction of a child is a
parent's worst nightmare. ABC's
"Missing" speaks to this hellish
ordeal with a straightforward,
action-packed
plot, featuring
Ashley Judd's
first appear- Missing
ance on a net-
work television Pilot
series. Thursdays
After ex-CIA
agent Rebecca
Winstone's ABC
(Ashley Judd,
"Double Jeopardy") son goes
missing while abroad in Rome,
she travels there in search of him,
willing to use any means neces-
sary to bring him back.
Rebecca's history with the
CIA is murky: She deactivated
after her husband was killed by a
car bomb and now dedicates her
time to raising their son Michael
(Nick Eversman, "Vampires
Suck"). Michael doesn't know
of his parents' past lives, even
though he witnessed his father's
car go up in flames. Rebecca
and Michael now have a very
close relationship, evidenced by
Rebecca's annoyingly consistent
phone calls and texts.
Michael's kidnapping is not
random - Rebecca finds pic-
tures of him along the trail that
date back prior to his arrival in
Europe. Was Michael involved
in something illegal that is now
coming back to haunt him? Or
does someone have an agenda
against Rebecca, using Michael
as a mere pawn? These questions
aren't answered in the first hour,
but leave us eager to find out.
"Missing" is reminiscent of
the 2008 film "Taken," in which
Liam Neeson's character travels
to Europe in order to save his
daughter after she is abducted in

Do a crazy dance.
The hidden musical
merits of Disney stars

Student-run
YouTube show
inspired by 'SNL'
By JOEY STEINBERGER
For the Daily
The weekend begins on Fri-
day for most college students.
For some, this means meeting
up with a friend or a chance to
catch up on a book you're read-
ing for fun. For the cast and crew
of Th'Undergrads, Fridays are
a time to pitch a flurry of ideas,
draft the best ones and film some
sketch comedy.
Th'Undergrads is the Univer-
sity's first televised sketch com-
edy group. Last summer, School
of Music Theatre & Dance senior
RJ Brown and some of his friends
who act decided they wanted to
do a sketch-comedy show. Brown
approached LSA senior lecturer
Terri Sarris, who connected him
with two groups of students who
had the same idea. In an inter-
view, the show's five producers
gave their thoughts on the pro-
duction process.
"Everyone had the pieces that
everyone else's group was miss-
ing," said LSA junior Billy Finken-
staedt.
Students in the Th'Undergrads
come from a wide variety ofcome-
dic backgrounds, including those
who come from improv groups,
others who are actors or stand-up
comics, and even those who were
not involved in these pursuits
before Th'Undergrads. Because
of this mix, LSA senior Joey Ber-
gen believes that the group has a
"wide range of different styles of
humor and different approaches
to humor."
"I was really worried that
we weren't going to mesh,"
added LSA senior Jacqueline
Wilton."But I think its been OK."
The producers cite "Saturday
Night Live" as the group's big-

gest influence. Sketch-comedy
shows that use many camera
angles, such as "The State" and
"Mr. Show," also play a part in the
group's artistic decisions.
Unlike other sketch comedy
groupson campus, Th'Undergrads
films sketches and uploads them
to YouTube. They don't perform
their comedy live ... yet.
"That was the initial goal,"
Finkenstaedt said. "It became a
goal for the end of this semester."
Part of the problem keeping
Th'Undergrads from live audi-
ences is their filming schedule.
Th'Undergrads films in the base-
ment of North Quad, and because
the building is owned and oper-
ated by the University, the group
has to conform to a restrictive
film schedule.
"If we could film later on Fri-
days it would be easier to ... secure
an audience thatcouldstay for the
length of shooting," Finkenstaedt
said.
Though the Th'Undergrads
film schedule is less than ideal,
the group does feel as though it
benefits from its relationship with
the University.
"We get to use these awesome
sets and these incredible cameras
that are not usually afforded to
people with our experience level,"
Finkenstaedt added.
For now, fans of the show are
able to watch the group's antics
online. The show releases a
new, roughly 30-minute episode
every month. In the first episode,
sketches include a divorced game-
show host whose cheating wife
appears as a contestant on his
show, and University President
Mary Sue Coleman dressed as a
dominatrix hosting a fireside chat.
They haven't heard anything
from the University about that
one yet.
At the writers' meeting this
month, sketch ideas included an
upbeat sitcom with the cast of
"The Silence of the Lambs" and
a lounge singer who forgets her

song mid-verse and is forced to
awkwardly improvise. All the
writers were conscientious of
keeping the sketches original.
Some ideas were noted as too sim-
ilar to a sketch in "SNL" or a scene
in "Family Guy."
Th'Undergrads hopes to have
members of football team on the
show in an upcomingepisode.
"We're not so closely tied with
Michigan but ... we are trying to
represent (that) we are Michigan
students and we put this togeth-
er," said LSA junior Nick Drew.
As students, the producers dis-
cussed how it has been difficult to
juggle course work with involve-
ment in Th'Undergrads. While
a few individuals are receiving
independent-study credit for the
project, others have classes that
don't relate.
"We have to ... stay up real-
ly late nights," Brown said.
"Th'Undergrads has now become
a primary engagement."
"Th'Undergrads is more impor-
tant to me ... a lot of my classes
are just theory, and this is actual
hands-on working with people,"
Drew added.
Furthermore, the show's pro-
ducers have had to learna lot from
scratch because they're a new stu-
dent group.
"A lot of it is on-the-fly learn-
ing," Drew said. "It can be a clus-
ter-mess at times."
"(For) the first episode, we shot
eight sketches in one day," Brown
added. "We finished at 4 p.m. and
had all eight sketches shot ... we
learned that this is a machine that
is going to be oiled and it's only
going to get better."
Students interested in becom-
ing involved with Th'undergrads
should look for them in the fall.
"Hopefully, next semester,
auditions will be held, writers'
applications submitted and crew
applications submitted," Brown
said. "We're hoping to open this
up now that our name is out
there."

It doesn't surprise me in the
slightest that so many albums go
unnoticed when they come from
a Disney artist. Perhaps it's the
nothing-but-serious, not-imma-
ture-in-any-way-at-ali album
titles like Can't Be Tamed or Guilty
Pleasure that really do it for music
shoppers at a glance. Or maybe it's
the general attitude that Disney
kiddies are just spoiled brats who
get whateverthey want-- in these
cases, a record deal.
But I'm sure most of us would
agree thatthe world wouldn't be a
better place withoutHilary Duff's
Metamorphosis, which to this day
- almost 10 years later - isn't
considered "So Yesterday."
So stop thinking so hard about
the politics of it all, and check out
these albums with your ears, not
your eyes.
Jesse McCartney -
Right Where You Want Me
Jesse McCartney, this musi-
cal style is right where I want
you. Regardless of what his
other albums lead one to believe,
McCartney was born to be
a pop-rock singer. All of the
album's tracks are composed of
little more than voice, guitar and
drums.
This combination of rock and
pop gives McCartney an automat-
ic maturity boost without hav-
ing to sacrifice his radio-friendly
quality - let's not forget that
"pop" stands for popular. In fact,
you're probably more familiar
with the song "Right Where You
Want Me" than you think.
The second-most-notable
track, "Anybody," might also
strike some familiarity. This song
and a few otherswere written and
produced by hit songwriter Kara
DioGuardi, who - as you might
recall - became despised on mul-
tiple levels merely for existing as a
judge on "American Idol."
Unfortunately, with his follow-
up album, Departure, McCartney
jumped onto the R&B bandwagon

which all male artists seem to ride
nowadays, in an attempt to sound
as indistinguishable from Justin
Timberlake as possible.

(Laughs) You know it's for can-
cer, right?
Yeah, maybe don't put that in
there.
It's OK. Honesty is the best
policy. But what happened that
made you not want to do it
again?
I don't even remember what it
was. I was so high I blacked it out.
I don't remember anything except
getting candy everywhere and
it was beautiful and I wanted to
lay on the grass. I didn't feel like
walking.
Wow. You really are taking the
"honesty" thing seriously. Well,
maybe since you blacked it out,
you'd want to sign up this year
and make some memories. It's
actually pretty fun. There's
food and cool booths set up.
Yeah. Maybe I'll go super sober,
get some exercise and then get
high as a reward.

That's definitely one way of
looking at it. Do you do any-
thing that doesn't involve mari-
juana?
(Laughs) Yes. Sorry, I came on a
little strong there. This is mildly
inappropriate. Let me think. I
usually go to class not-high and
homework I do not-high. Um,
sometimes I work out and go to
the movies, but yeah, I do that
when I'm high.
Nice.
I like to shop - definitely no-high
- or else you get overwhelmed
and there are so many choices.
So yeah, shopping is one. I love
live music, which may or may not
involve marijuana.
That's great! I hope I'm not
making you feel bad about this.
No judgments, seriously. It's
college.
Yeah, I figure once I graduate, my
habits will totally nose-dive. It's
not cool to go to work stoned silly.
And I want to be a real person, not
some loser who can't do anything
without being high first. I guess
I'm trying to pack it all in now
before graduation. But really...

Well, at least you have your

meant to be some kind of inter-
vention. More power to you.
Thanks, I appreciate it. I'm sorry
if you're going to have to re-do
this. It must be super awkward
to ambush people and have over-
sharers like myself.
It's actually the highlight ofmy
day. No sarcasm. I'minto super
awkward situations and ambush-
ing and over-sharers, or else I
wouldn't be doing this. Plus, I like
meeting new people, especially at
a university of this size.
Hi! Care to answer
a few questions?
Gah! P
Yeah. It must be kind of cool to
meet someone new every day.
Too bad it's anonymous. I feel
like the Random Student Inter-
views could also be an insight
into a new person that you'd
want as a friend. Like, attach
the person's e-mail if you wanna
hang out.
(Laughs) I think it's a good thing
this is anonymous. Especially
because I'd probably get an influx
of e-mails from people who want
to blaze with me, and that's just
annoying. Find me on Hash Bash

RELAY
From Page 5B
cross-section of campus that encompasses a
range of organizationsranging from Greek
students to religious groups to pre-profes-
sional organizations.
It also allows a number of associations to
personalize their fundraising efforts toward
their own organization's mission.
For instance, the Muslim Students' Asso-
ciation cannot hold bar nights because
traditional Islamic teaching forbids the
consumption of alcohol. So this forces
them to be a little more creative with their
efforts.
LSA freshman Kinza Ilyas, chair of MSA's
Relay for Life committee, said that instead
of bar nights, the group focused on raising
money from members during their Friday
prayers and through community outreach.
"We're trying to highlight our cultural
aspects" in our fundraising efforts, Ilyas
said.
On the day of the event, the MSA will be
on hand to sell hummus to hungry runners.
LSA senior Daniel Spencer, captain
of the Society of Biology Students team,
is spearheading the organization's first
Relay for Life team. The team, 15 strong,

is in the midst of fundraising for the com-
ing year. According to Spencer, establish-
ing a Relay for Life team was made much
easier by the support he'd received from
the Relay's leadership team, which also
empowered him to inspire his own team
members.
"I don't think that the weight of the situ-
ation really hit me, but after going to every
single one of these events (sponsored by
the leadership team), they've given me the
motivation to get my team going," Spencer
said.
Still, the motivation for each of these stu-
dents is quite similar.
"Cancer is the universal enemy," Davis
said. "We all know someone who's been
affected by cancer in some way."
For some student Relay participants, the
fight against cancer literally hits close to
home. LSA sophomore Sarah Peck, philan-
thropy chair for the Chi-Omega sorority,
said this year in particular carries special
meaning for her Relay efforts.
Just over a month ago, the father of her
close friend passed away from cancer. Dur-
ing his year with the illness, Peck was
inspired by her friend's dad's perseverance
in the face of a bleak prognosis.
As Peck pointed out, he even continued

his commitment to public service.
"He ran for mayor again, and won," Peck
said. "When he passed away, he was (still)
the mayor of our town."
Many students shared a similar connec-
tion to cancer, whether it be a grandparent,
parent, other family member, friend or mem-
ber of their community.
This is the core reason that impels such an
eclectic group of people to generate money
for the cause.
Of course, one of Relay's biggest draws is
the event itself.
From all accounts, the event has a car-
nival-like atmosphere with a variety of
activities that keep participants occupied
during all day and night. LSA junior Madison
Goforth, entertainment director for Relay
for Life, is in charge of coordinating the con-
certs and performances that occur periodi-
cally throughout the day.
"In terms of staffing it, we've definite-
ly had a help with more students getting
involved and wanting to be on the planning
committee," Goforth said. "We're always
trying to make things exciting and do things
a little bit differently."
Dance group EnCore, Impact Dance,
and the a cappella group Amazin' Blue
are all lined up to perform at this year's

Relay. Goforth added that they are also
trying to get a "big name" band for the
event as well.
The Luminaria ceremony serves as the
major draw for many participants.
The ceremony, a hallmark of virtually
every Relay for Life event nationwide, is a
touching remembrance of those who have
lost a battle with cancer. Participants light
candles in a flickering, silent remembrance
of those who have passed away. These indi-
vidual candles also light the way around the
track for the runners.
Simultaneously somber and uplifting, the
Luminaria ceremony reminds the partici-
pants of their mission: to defeat the "univer-
sal enemy."
Lewis said his favorite moment in the
event was always the Luminaria ceremony,
but he cited last year's as particularly memo-
rable. For the first time, he was able to add a
picture of him and his father for the entire
Relay to see.
"Seeing us up there on the big screen in a
front of everyone was really powerful to me,"
Lewis said. "(My dad is) something that I've
always held on to, but to share that with the
community that's there for the same reason
... is always very moving. I'm always br ought
to tears.


GCHAT
From Page 6B
whole life or having it vanish into thin air, the latter might actually be
a relief.
When asked whether she'd miss her data if it were suddenly inac-
cessible to her, LSA freshman Paige Wittmann's response was ambiva-
lent.
"I'd probably be a little bit upset," she said. "Like when Timeline
came out (on Facebook), I looked back and found things that were
funny and that were important and seemed like the end of the world
or the greatest thing ever. But when you look back, they're not really
relevant now at all. So, yeah, I'd probably be a little bit upset, but it's not
gonna be detrimental."
Perhaps there are benefits that come with shedding the data we call
conversations and letters. Gchat can rapidly become oppressive, and
freeing oneself from the digital clutter may not just be relaxing, it may
be necessary.
Gumport discussed the downside that comes with a culture of chat.
In her own words, "there's a sort of claustrophobia to it," as the lines
separating one facet of our lives from another slowly dissipate. A study
session in the library is soon indistinguishable from chatter on your
living room sofa.
"It's like working from home, almost," she said. "It's like your
entire life is lived in one place, and there's no escape from it."
She added, "It's kind of like being under house arrest. What could
happen outside of Gchat? Kind of nothing, right? Because all your
friends are there, your work is there, there's nothing outside. And that's
sort of the sour side of it."
Maybe the trick to Gehat lies in remembering how to disconnect, if
only momentarily. That is, if we can.

Alone,together
How Gchat can (dis)connect

By Jacob Axelrad

Friend: are you busy after 8 tonight?
Me:I can't do it today
I'm like doing some stuff
And by that I mean reading and sleeping
Friend:HAHAHAH it'll just take like 45
minIcan meet you infishbowl even
plzzzzzzzzzzzzz
we need to get this taken care of
Me: Sleep is a thing humans have to do once
every four days
I'm duefor my sleep
Let's talk about how we talk.
Or, rather, how we "chat" here at the Uni-
versity, an environment where things are
easily pushed to the periphery - class melds
with work which melds with the party you
attended last weekend in a series of conver-
sational tidbits.
How do you gather the pieces, strike a
balance? Maybe it's right there, in the same
place you go while procrastinating on that
paper, surfing the web in lecture or killing
time at work: Gchat.
Constantly plugged in
You sign in to Gmail to check an e-mail
from a professor. All of a sudden, your friend
sends you a message:
Friend:I MISS YOU!
Just like that, you've inserted yourself into
the Angell Hall of the Internet, the green dot
next to your name in the lower left corner of
your Gchat page signaling your availability
to speak. You've opened yourself up to con-
versation.
Me: I MISS YOU TOO
sorry i couldn't go to detroit this weekend
i heard you saw emily
Friend: no worries!
come another time!!
yeah she came saturday
Me: i want to see you!
Friend:Back atya!!

At times, it feels like half our lives are
spent sending e-mails for classes, for jobs
or for internships. Gehat prolongs that cor-
respondence into an endless stream of con-
versation, supplying the potential to talk to
whomever, whenever, about whatever.
Most of the conversations are unremark-
able - throwaway. They're about what you
want to eat for dinner and why you still
haven't started that Anthro paper.
But Gehatting also provides the arena for
intimacy, a place where one's deepest revela-
tions of love and loss are exposed in the com-
fort of one's own home.
"You can Gchat in bed," Elizabeth Gum-
port, a senior editor of the literary magazine
n+1, said.
Friend:Hey how was your date last week?
Me: Um it was okay
Friend:Just okay?
Me: The conversation was kind of one sided.
Not a lot of chemistry
But who knows really?
It's probably too early to tell
Gchat fosters new relationships and sus-
tains existing ones. University alum Jeffrey
Domsic did not talk to his long-distance girl-
friend from Denver on the phone. He chat-
ted with her instead. For the three years he
was in Ann Arbor up until his graduation
from the University last year, the burden of
never seeing her was eased by Google Chat.
"Without social media, I don't think (the
relationship) would have worked," Domsic
said. "Without being able to stay in touch as
much as social media allows us to, it wouldn't
work. We don't have the personalities to be
able to handle it."
The "salon"
In her article "Chathexis," which was
published in n+l last August, Gumport likens
Gehat to a 21st century French salon - tradi-
tionally comfortable, informal gatherings of
intellectuals during the Enlightenment.
"The best Gehat conversations take place,

like those of the salon, with one or both
participants in repose, stretched out on a
couch or in bed. Tucked beneath our covers,
laptops propped on our knees - is this not
the posture most conducive to meaningful
Gchatting?" Gumport writes in the article.
In an interview, Gumport described Gchat
as a means to bring people together online in
a way that's reminiscent of more personal
relationships.
On Gehat, the conversations are one-on-
one. They are leisurely. No one wears a title,
just a name. The participants are on an equal
playing field.
"There's this sense of equality and possi-
bility to me that seems kind of unique,"Gum-
port said.
And late at night, Gchat returns philoso-
phy to the bedroom - the pallid glow of the
laptop screen becoming romantic and mys-
terious.
"Which perhaps is why so many of us feel
our best selves in Gchat," Gumport writes.
"Silent, we are unable to talk over our friends,
and so we become better and deeper listen-
ers, as well as better speakers - or writers .
We have time to express ourselves precisely,
without breaking the rhythm."
Hoarding the past
We can return to these conversations, the
evidence of the day you were craving Thai
food archived in a neat tab on your browser.
Gumport's second idea is the theory of
Gchat as a secretaire, a locked 17th century
writing desk used by women to store letters.
The secretaires served as private reposito-
ries of correspondence, proof that the dia-
logues between individuals existed. But
in order to access these conversations, the
secretaire requires a password, a secret key.
Gchat operates in much the same way -
the passwords acting as key grooves inserted
into a lock; a quick search of your conversa-
tion partner's name retrieving entire dia-
logues from your inbox. In a sense, we are
hoarders of the ephemeral.
But what happens when the data exceeds
the storage capacity, when we can no longer
return to those conversations with friends
we've come to rely upon? What happens
when Google employs the first major use of
the delete key?
As School of Information Prof. Paul Con-
way says, you can only hold onto the past for
so long. Sooner or later, something must give.
Citing a study carried out by the market
intelligence firm International Data Corpo-
ration, "The Diverse and Exploding Digital
Universe," Conway explained that the model
of "saving everything forever" is unsustain-
able.
2007, the year the study was performed,
was the first year in recorded history
where the total amount of digital informa-
tion exceeded the digital storage capacity,
according to the study. And almost half of
the digital universe was projected to be inca-
pable of being adequately stored by 2011. In
a follow-up study in 2011, IDC reported that
the world would create 1.8 zettabytes of
information.

The study also says the amount of personal
data that gets stored, like the kind generated
on PCs and MacBooks, "exceeded all expec-
tations in 2007." In essence, consumers are
just beginning to understand the need to
preserve information when it may already be
too late.
Conway believes this phenomenon will
soon affect users of social media such as
Gehat and Facebook.
"Its kin d of like
being under house
arrest. What could
happen outside
of Gchat? Kind
of nothing, right?
Because all your
friends are there,
your work is there,
there's nothing out-
side. And that's sort
of the sour side of it."
-Elizabeth Gumport, n+ 1 senior
editor
"We've passed the point at which digital
information that's created exceeds the abil-
ity to store it," he said. "We're getting to a
point where a decision has to be made about
what gets stored and what doesn't. And then
the question becomes 'Well, who makes that
decision? And under what circumstances?"'
In a manner similar to the practice of
accessing old banking records, in the next
few years you may be required to put in a
request to access old photos and online con-
versations. This means childhood memories
won't necessarily be stashed underneath
your bed at home, Conway said. They may
very well be locked away in a database.
"You write your mother for fifth grade,
but you write Mark Zuckerberg for 2004," he
said. "He's got it. It's over there in a folder.
He'll send it to you if you want to see your
(Facebook) posts from college.
"You'll get them. But you're going to have to
ask. And worse, you're going to have to pay."
The external self
But is this necessarily a bad thing? When
faced with the choice between keeping every
Gehat conversation and wall post in your

learning about pride week
[status update] by jordan rochelson
Tell me about the rally on the Diag that happened
last Monday for Pride Week.
it's on annual event just to kind of bring excitement to the
campus community and be a visible presence as LGBT
students on campus.
Do you feel like you have the student body's support?
Last year, with the whole Chris Armstrong debacle, it
definitely felt like the student body was behind us, but
a lot of times that support isn't necessarily visible.
Are people on campus aware of LGBT issues?
In Ann Arbor, we like to think of ourselves as like "Oh
Michigan, a really liberal campus." But that doesn't mean
that things don't happen.
If you were running for president, what would
your slogan be?
Community First.
