Members of Students Allied for Freedom and Equality stage a simulation of a West Bank checkpoint on the Diag Wednesday as part of Palestinian Awan
Week.
Student's recreate West

Bank's 'checkpoint'

SAFE demonstration
seeks to highlight
current situation
in Gaza
By WILL GREENBERG
DailyNews Editor
After a summer of conflict
in Gaza, Students Allied for
Freedom and Equality offered
University students a close-up
perspective on the situation in

the West Bank Wednesday.
As part of a Palestinian
Awareness Week, SAFE's Edu-
cation Day featured a staged
simulation of a West Bank check-
point in the Diag. Some members
dressed as Israeli soldiers while
others tried to "pass through"
their inspection. Two handmade
walls painted with "#UMDivest"
and maps showing the growth
of Israeli settlements over the
years served to represent the real
wall that runs through the West
Bank. The group's aim was to
simulate the experience of Pales-

tinians whose families have been
separated by the wall by creating
a similar disturbance for stu-
dents passing through the Diag
between classes.
SAFE's demonstration
Wednesday mimicked the daily
commute of Palestinians from
the West Bank into Israel. The
West Bank is a highly contested
area due to Israeli settlements,
which Palestinians decry as an
occupation of land that is right-
fully theirs. Between the Israeli
and Palestinian sections of the
West Bank are Israeli check-

policy
points, similar to a border patrol
between two neighboring coun-
tries. These checkpoints have
been repeatedly criticized for
using racial profiling and unfair
treatment of Palestinians when
Israeli soldiers conduct searches
to prevent transfers of weapons.
The student simulation ran
at peak periods between classes
throughout the day and SAFE
members handed out flyers and
other information between dem-
onstrations. SAFE denounces the
wall, with members referring to .

Daily survey shows
students wary of
city despite campus
outreach efforts
ByIAN DILLINGHAM
Daily News Editor
"If I was a venture capital-
ist with lots of spare change, I'd
make an investment in Detroit."
At a July 18 press conference
during his first week as Universi-
ty president, Mark Schlissel reaf-
firmed the University's ties with
Detroit, saying he was impressed
by the work of both students and
faculty in the city. Having spent
two days in the city prior to com-
ing to Ann Arbor, he remained
cautiously optimistic about its
future.
"I don't think it's going to
become one of the small handfuls
ofmajorcitiesintheUnitedStates
which it was at the height of the
growth of the auto industry, but
I see lots.of seeds of redevelop-
ment and energy in the Detroit

economy that I predict five years
from now, Detroit's going to be a
vigorous city," Schlissel said.
In the coming weeks, Detroit
will likely reach a key point in its
15-month bankruptcysaga. Pend-
ing a decision by Judge Steven
Rhodes - who will hold a hearing
about a potential deal between
the city and it's last major credi-
tor, Financial Guaranty Insur-
ance Co. - the city has a chance
to emerge from Chapter 9 bank-
ruptcy by the end of year.
But despite what many are
lauding as a successful turn-
around, a recent Michigan Daily
survey suggests students might
not be so confident about the
city's future.
In an e-mail survey of 230 ran-
domly selected undergraduates,
only 22 percent of respondents
indicated they would consider
living in the city after graduation
if presented with an employment
or educational opportunity, com-
pared to 55 percent or more in
similar metropolitan areas, such
as NewYork City, Chicago, Wash-
ington, D.C. and San Francisco.

U.S. practices in
Iraq questioned
by researchers

Lecture discusses
increased birth
defects as result of
munitions usage
By AMABEL KAROUB
Two experts in the field of
Iraqi public health gave a lecture
Wednesday night on the increase
of birth defects in the war-torn
nation.
Muhsin Al-Sabbak, a physi-
cian at Iraq's Basra Maternity
Hospital, and Mozhgan Sava-
bieasfahani, an environmental
toxicologist who resides in Ann
Arbor, presented a one-hour lec-
ture centered on their research,
which links the increase in con-
genital birth defects in Iraq over
the last two decades to the use of
U.S. and coalitions force weapons
there.
Al-Sabbak referenced his study
that found a 17-fold increase
in children with birth defects

between the years1995and 2003,
a jump from 1.37 birth defects per
1,000 children to 23 per 1,000. By
2008, the number had increased
to 48 per 1000, and in 2014 it was
37 per 1000.
Savabieasfahani attributed the
spike to an increase in pollutants
caused by U.S. weapons and the
presence of military bases.
"The most important event
that happened in these years was
U.S. invasion and U.S. bombard-
ments," Savabieasfahani said. "As
much as we don't like to get into
politics, pollution is a very politi-
cal thing."
Savabieasfahani said bombs,
bullets and explosives increase
the amount of toxic metal such
as lead and mercury in the envi-
ronment. She also said U.S. mili-
tary bases often have "open air
burn pits," or pits in which they
burn disregarded military waste,
releasing dangerous pollutants
into the atmosphere that are
inhaledbyindividuals inthe area.

Obama to

Despite low approval

By BEN ATLAS
Daily StaffReporter
With First Lady Michelle
Obama set to arrive in Detroit
Friday, it appears Michigan will
be one of the few states that will
also play host to her husband this
midterm season.
Despite registering a 43-per-
cent approval rating in the lat-
est Gallup poll, President Barack
Obama is still scheduled to cam-
paign for U.S. Rep. Gary Peters'
(D-Mich.) U.S. Senate bid, and

Students provided
with alternatives
in anticipation of
weekend activities
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
In preparation for the foot-
ball game against Penn State
this Saturday night, seven
student leaders sampled sand-
wiches and non-alcoholic

drinks from local restaurants
on the Diag to find the tastiest
"Stay in the Blue" meal as part
of Wolverine Wellness's True
Blue Sandwich and Drink Con-
test.
The Stay in the Blue initia-
tive encourages students to act
responsibly when participat-
ing in social activities, includ-
ing those involving alcohol.
In order to "stay in the blue,"
a student must have a blood-
alcohol content of .06 or less as
a chart tracks their levels, with
blue representing the safe zone

and red indicating dangerous
levels of alcohol consumption.
Wolverine Wellness collabo-
rated with popular restaurants
including Conor O'Neill's,
Pizza House, Sava's, Score-
keepers Bar and Grill and the
University's Beanster's Cafe to
host the contest. The restau-
rants were asked to submit an
affordable sandwich as well as
a non-alcoholic or caffeinated
drink to advertise as a Stay in

lishments on football Satur-

Family ties change perspective

LSA senior Adam DesJardins
has a unique viewpoint on
professors. While many students
see the6,200-plus faculty members
at the University through the lens
of a professional relationship, a
few, likeAdam, know them as their
mothers, fathers or friends. His
father,StephenDesJardins, teaches
higher secondary education in the
School of Education.
In what ways do you feel like
having a parent who works at
the University changes your
perspective as astudent?
I think of those posters from
high school that were like "We
don't tolerate: racism, sexism,
etc." andthere was always ageism

on there, which caught my eye
because I feel like we don't talk
about it often. But because I
personally know more professors
on campus, I feel like I connect
way more easily with people
who are older than me than your
average student. I think that's a
really important thing to have
when you're in this bubble of
other people your age.
Have youhad any friends
who've had a class with your
dadbefore?
Not many, since he only
teaches grad students. But I have
had a few people in classes say,
"Oh, I've had class with your
dad," or "Oh, I'm trying to -take

your dad's class!" But overall, not
many friends have taken any of
his classes.
Do you have a sense of con-
nection with other students
whose parents teach at the
University?
I actually just ran into one of
my best friend's neighbors who
is also one of my friend's parents.
She gave me a hug and called me
"sweetie." I think it's interesting
because I feel like at Michigan,
very few of us get a chance to
really interact with people out-
side of our age group. Not many
people hug their professor a lot or
any adult while we're at school.

We'd support the improvement

While campaigning, Kelly
said town-gown relations were
key to his platform and to voters.
Residents' concerns included a
fear of increasing property taxes
as a result of the University's
recent purchase of significant
amounts of land throughout
the city, including the property
on which the University is con-
structing the Munger Graduate
Residence Hall and this year's
purchase of the Edwards Broth-
ers property on South State
Street. Kelly said he hopes to
see the University demonstrate
more respect for the city.
"The first thing out of peo-
ple's mouth was, 'What are you
going to do about the Univer-
sity of Michigan?' " Kelly said.
"Time will tell. I think it will
depend on the decisions that
our leaders make and the cir-
cumstances that we face togeth-
er as a city."
Citizens have also expressed
concerns about the direction
in which Ann Arbor is head-
ing, potentially leaving behind
the history and character it has
held. While Kelly admitted such
a change is inevitable in some
ways, Taylor said he hopes to
incorporate the new and the old
downtown, meeting the needs
and desires of a variety of citi-
zens, from students to longtime
residents.
"Our downtown has changed
significantly," Taylor said. "I am
open to the downtown character
evolving,"
Kelly said he looks forward
more to the development of
neighborhoods than the city's
downtown. Much of his strategy
in dealing with downtown devel-
opment issues involves emphasis
on improved and more direct
communication with citizens in
order to better understand the
kind of downtown envisioned by
various groups of the city's resi-
dents.
"I would first and foremost
like to see high-speed fiber infra-
structure," Kelly said. "But gov-
ernment in the modern day can
speak directly to people."
The general election will take
place Nov. 4, and future mayoral
debates are yet to be announced.

it as the "apartheid wall" and citing
incidents involving family mem-
bers in which the checkpoints hin-
dered timely arrival of ambulances
and created other difficulties.
Business junior Laith Hasan, a
co-chair of SAFE, said his family
lives in Palestine and he has been
through the checkpoints himself.
He explained the range of difficul-
ties the checkpoints pose for Pal-
estinians and his frustration with
what he and his family feel is an
injusticebyIsraeli soldiers.
"For the most part they're all
very similar," Hasan said. "They'll
make you line up; they'll make you
wait avery longtime; they'll search
you; they'll check your identifica-
tion; they'll do random things that

they feel like doing; if they want
to bring you to the side and talk
to you or not let you go through,
somethinglike that. It's really upto
the discretion of the soldier at the
checkpoint."
Joel Reinstein, an active mem-
ber of SAFE, posed as one of the
Israeli soldiers for the simulation.
Reinstein said he created his script
from a combination of researched
reports done by human rights
groups and firsthand accounts.
Both Reinstein and Hasan were
involved in SAFE's #UMDivest
movement last March, which pro-
posed a resolution to Central Stu-
dent Government that called on
the University to divest from com-
panies allegedly involved in human
rights violations in Palestine. After
the vote on the resolution was
postponed indefinitely, SAFE and
its supporters staged a sit-in at the
CSG chambers until the follow-

ing meeting a week later, when the
assembly ultimately voted against
the resolution. SAFE memberssaid
they felt muted by CSG's initial
decision to table the proposal. Stu-
dents perceived to be on either side
of the conflict experienced verbal
hostility throughout the duration
of the sit-in.
Hasan said he hopes this
semester will be calmer and
that SAFE is encouraging all of
its members to report any con-
frontational incidents. In fact, a
passerby approached the SAFE
members working the informa-
tion table Wednesday and berated
them with insensitive and accu-
satory comments regarding Pal-
estine and the students' families.
Hasan said these kinds of issues
persist and make students per-
ceived to be Middle Eastern feel
unsafe on campus.
"We're still really fighting a

tough battle just trying to get our
voice heard and tryingto getcam-
pus to recognize that the power
and privilege dynamics that exist
between a group like SAFE and
other institutions," he said.
Representatives from pro-Isra-
el and Jewish organizations on
campus were also present on the
Diag Wednesday. Business junior
Alex Adler, president of American
Movement for Israel and treasur-
er of University of Michigan Hil-
lel, and LSA senior Erica Mindel
observed the simulation and kept
an eye out for any Jewish students
who mighthave felt threatened or
at odds about the performance.
Both said SAFE has a "right to
self-expression" but felt the dem-
onstration and information pre-
sented lacked context.
Mindel said the presentation
failed to offer the Israeli argu-
ment for the wall, citing incidents

of terrorism and other violence
that could have been prevented by
checkpoints. She said the simula-
tion may have over-dramatized
the racial profiling by Israeli sol-
diers, and that SAFE's interpreta-
tion of events was one-sided.
"I support a Palestinian state,
whatever that might look like when
a two-state solution happens,"
Mindel said. "I don't think that
it would necessarily be the same,
but as a Jewish person I think I'm
entitled to sayI support the state of
Israel without that being kind of an
outlandish statement."
The most recent escalation
in the struggle between Israel
and Palestine began after three
Israeli teenagers were kidnapped
and killed in June. Israel origi-
nally blamed the kidnappings on
Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic
organization that effectively gov-
erns the Gaza Strip and eventu-

ally claimed responsibility in
August. In July, a Palestinian
teenager was murdered by Israe-
lis in what was reported to be a
retaliatory killing.
For nearly two months after-
ward, Israel and Gaza launched
thousands of missiles at each
other, leading to a 28-day Israeli
airstrike along with a 19-day
ground invasion of Gaza. As a
result, thousands of Gaza resi-
dents were killed or displaced.
Palestinian Awareness Week
has already featured a Cultural
Day on the Diag on Monday and
spoken-word performances in
Rackham Auditorium Tuesday.
The events wrap up Thursday
with a movie showing of "When
I Saw You," a drama surrounding
an 11-year-old boy's flight from
Palestine to Jordan along with his
mother during a period of intense
violence in the region.

"They found these pits and they
would dump everything in it ... and
just burn it."
The U.S. Department of Veter-
ans Affairs acknowledges these
burn pits were widely used at mili-
tary bases in Iraq and Afghani-
stan but denies that any long-term
health effects among U.S. veterans
have been linked to these pits.

lation of pollutants could be

that examined children with birth

The sandwiches and drinks
were judged on taste, creativity
and price. Many of the items uti-
lized blue cheese or blueberries
to stick with the "blue" theme.
Conor O'Neill's buffalo burger and
Sava's Maize & Blue BLT tied for
best overall sandwich, and Pizza

best overall drink.
"Part of staying in the blue is to
be able to eat and to have non-alco-

an appearance from the President,
according to Politico. Unlike some
other Democratic Senate hope-
fuls, Peters has two factors that
could make a visit from Obama
advantageous: a lead in the polls
and a shared stance on issues that
he and the President can empha-
size. Peters is eight points ahead of
Republican opponent Terri Lynn
Land, according to RealClearPoli-
tics aggregate polling, and that
cushion may mitigate the setbacks
of appearing with an unpopular
president.
Moreover, Peters supported
Obama's 2009 auto industry bail-
out and has made it a point of
emphasis in his campaign. In addi-
tion to the importance of the auto
bailout, the fact that Michigan is

one of the few states left with a vis-
ible union population might make
Obama an effective surrogate for
Peters, according to Political Sci-
ence Prof. Michael Traugott.
"For Peters, (Obama) would be
interested in trying to seal the deal
and to garner enough support to
dissuade the Republican establish-
ment further in their support of

levels and six-times greater mercu-
ry levels than those without birth
defects.
Al-Sabbak has been researching
birth defects in Iraq since 1994. He
said it is important to raise aware-
ness about what is happening in
Iraq in order to stop the harm cur-
rently being done.

As the judges chowed down

Land," Traugott said.
For Schauer, however, the pur-
pose of Obama's potential appear-
ance would be different. Unlike in
the Senate race, the auto bailout is
not a wedge issue between Schauer
and Republican Gov. Rick Snyder,
whose support of the auto industry
and Detroit overall has been well
documented. Schauer's campaign
would still try to stake a claim to
the auto bailout issue, though, as
he did support it while in Congress.
"People know that it was Presi-
dent Obama and Democrats like
Mark Schauer who fought to res-
cue Michigan's auto industry and
save thousands of good middle
class jobs," wrote Zack Pohl, com-
munications director for Schauer,
in an e-mail.
Schauer also does not have the
benefit of leading in the polls, as
RealClearPolitics has him trailing
Snyder by 4 points.
"For Schauer, (Obama is) prob-
ably goingto spend his time talking
about turnout," Traugott said. "In
a tight race, that's what each candi-
date is interested in."
Though it may seem tenuous
for candidates of the same party
to avoid appearing with the Presi-

dent, recent history shows that it
is actually a common status for
second term executives. Presidents
tend to have low approval ratings
in their second term that result in
midterm losses. For instance, for-
mer President George W. Bush's
approval rating at this time in 2006
sat at 37 percent according to Gal-
lup, and resulted in Democratic
gains in the House and Senate.

Violence
The most contentious issue
for students: safety.
In2013,Forbes rankedDetroit
as the most dangerous city in the
United States for the fifth year
in a row. That year, the city had
more than 300 homicides among
a population of just more than
700,000. By comparison, Chica-
go - with more than 2.7 million
residents - recorded just more
than 400 homicides the same
year. New York City - with more
than 8.4 million residents - had
just more than 330.
Despite a 7-percent drop in
violent crime in 2013, cuts to
police funding have left some
residents wary. In January,
Detroit Police Chief James Craig
openly encouraged Detroiters to
seek concealed pistol licenses as
a deterrent against criminals.
"I've joked about this with my
friends," said Engineering junior
Eyad Tamimi. "If I were to live
in Detroit, I'd get a concealed
carry license. I'm not particu-
larly in favor of guns, but in some
neighborhoods you have to have
that as a precaution."
Tamimi, an international
student originally from Jordan
who recently transferred to the
University, said his perception of
high poverty and unemployment
rates would discourage him
from ever moving to the city.
Some with ties to the city,
however, have come to accept
the uneasy status quo.
Craig Regester, associate
director of the University's
Semester in Detroit program,
said he has experienced crime
firsthand. In 18 years living in
the city, he has had three inci-
dents of damage to his car and
one bike stolen, though he knows
individuals who have experi-
enced more serious incidents.
"We have a serious problem
with guns in this country, and
Detroit is part of this country,
so yes gun violence is a problem
in Detroit," Regester said. "It is
a problem for Detroit, and it is a
problem for other major cities.
We don't hide from that."
For students unfamiliar with
the city, Regester said the Uni-
versity has "an opportunity, and
frankly a responsibility, to speak
the truth" about what is hap-
pening in Detroit. He said while
crime is a major point of discus-
sion, it should not be a factor that
prohibits students from explor-
ing the city, citing that violence
is a part of life in most major U.S.
cities.
Regester described a con-
versation with a French for-
eign exchange student who,

prior to coming to the United
States, considered the situation1
in Detroit equivalent to that of
Syria, where the United States is
currently conducting airstrikes1
and hundreds of thousands of
people have fled to neighboring1
countries. In the past, RegesterI
said students have similarly lik-
ened the city to Lebanon or Gaza
prior to visiting.
In contrast, other students
- such as those from the West'
Coast or those who did not fol-
low national news in high school
- come to the University with
no prior knowledge of the city,
its history or its current chal-
lenges.
"It really depends on who you
talk to," Regester said. "I think
there's such a range of impres-
sions."

Reputations
Whatever these impressions
may be, the University and the
city are - and have been - inex-
tricably linked.
Before moving to Ann Arbor
in 1837 - the same year Michi-
gan was admitted to the Union
- the University was located
for its first 20 years in Detroit.
While the city and the Univer-
sity parted ways geographically,
Regester said they stood togeth-
er on the world stage for most of
the 20th century as manufactur-
ing boomed and technological
innovations abounded.
"The University is indebted in
many respects," Regester said.
And historically, that indebt-
edness was paid off through
a steady influx of University
graduates to the city each year,
though hard data in this respect
is difficult to find.
Regester said the decline in
Detroit's economy might have
resulted in decreased numbers
of college students entering the
city, but that it is difficult to
speculate. There is one statis-
tic, however, that he was proud
to highlight: one in three - the
number of alumni who have
lived or worked in Detroit after
completingthe SID program.
"People usually want more
of a relationship and a deeper
relationship with Detroit after
they've done our program,
because they've had some of
that experience," Regester said.
"Detroit sells itself as far as I'm
concerned."
One of the program's alumni,
Rashard Haynesworth, who
participated during the spring of
his junior year at the University,
still lives in the city two years
after graduating. He volunteers
with SID weekend programs
several times per year and cur-
rently works at Racquet Up
Detroit, a nonprofit youth devel-
opment program for which he
interned as part of the program.
A lifelong Detroit resident
and community college trans-
fer, Haynesworth said he felt
the need to give back to the city
upon arriving in Ann Arbor his
junior year. Students he talked

with were scared to visit the city,]
he said, in part based on media,
portrayals and in part because of
a lack of personal experiences in
the city.
Even Schlissl, who moved to
the region this summer, admit-
ted that media played a signifi-
cant role in his view of Detroit
prior to arriving in the state.
"The media generates an
impression of the city, and - not
having visited or lived here - of
course the impression is built on
what you read and what people
say," Schlissel said.
As a recruiting director on
campus, Haynesworth found
students had little reason or
motivation to explore the city,
with the exception of a few select
campus outreach programs,
such as the Detroit Partner-
ship - a student-run nonprofit
that organizes "service-learning
opportunities"between the Uni-
versity and city.
Along with concerns for per-
sonal safety, many students
Haynesworth interacted with
considered Detroit a "waste-
land."
"Once you hear it so many
times, you think, 'this is an
issue," Haynesworth said. "If
this is what people think about
the city, it's going to be hard to
attract young college graduates."
Repair
Regardless of how the major-
ity of students interact with the
city, those who make the move
are doing their part to help with
the improvement efforts and
change the perceptions of the
city inAnn Arbor.
Larissa Carr, a long-time
Detroit resident and SID par-
ticipant, said students are rarely
well informed about Detroit's
history, its culture or its people
- something she would like to
see changed. She stressed the
importance that students visit
the city in person and talk to its
residents i order to form their
own impressions, rather than
relying on what they hear from
outside sources.
"We're one of the most diverse
parts of the region," Carr said.
"That's our biggest asset - our
people."
After moving back to the city
and working for a short time at
the nonprofit Mercy Education
Project, which provides educa-
tional resources for low-income
women, Carr was hired to work
for state Rep. Rashida Tlaib
(D-Detroit). Despite being from
Detroit, she referred to SID as
one of the most valuable experi-
ences she had at the University.
She also highlighted the orga-
nizations and movements that
work to improve the city on a
daily basis. In her current posi-
tion, she said she spends time
connecting residents with the
resources they need to improve
their quality of life.
"There are so many differ-
ent organizations with people
on the ground doing grassroots
work to help improve the qual-
ity of life for the people that are
here," she said.
Meanwhile, the University

has continued to take part in the
revitalization efforts.
Since 2005, the Univer-
sity has operated its Detroit
Center, a facility of more than
26,000 square feet on Wood-
ward Avenue that works to pro-
mote engagement between the
city and campus communities.
Mike Morland, communications
director for the center, said stu-
dents who visit and learn about
the city often become more
engaged in the area.
The center works to facilitate
community events and expose
the University community to
different aspects of Detroit.
Such events include musical
performances, guest lectures,
service projects and historical
exhibits. Morland said promot-
ing this type of cultural interac-
tion provides a tangible benefit
to the Ann Arbor community,
reflective of the 200-year his-
tory of such interactions.
About a year ago, the Uni-
versity introduced a new bus
route - the Detroit Center Con-
nector - which aims to provide
students with a free means by
which to explore the city, which
has notoriously bad public tran-
sit systems. After a successful
first year of operation - during
which it provided approximately
6,000 rider trips to the city - the
program is looking to'expand its
scope in the coming year. Mor-
land pointed to this early success
as an indication that students on
campus are, in fact, interested in
being involved in the city.
"The students who get here
seem not only very interested in
visiting the city, but being part of
the change," Morland said.
Yet certain indicators still cast
uncertainty on student relations
with the city. In its first year of
operation, the primary subset of
riders on the Connector was stu-
dents traveling to Detroit to visit
their families. While Rackham
student Carolyn Lusch, trans-
portation coordinator for the
MDCC, said this discrepancy is
"still a way to enrich (students')
education," it brings into ques-
tion the effectiveness of such
programs at promoting cultural
exchange among the rest of the
campus body.
Additionally, the narratives
surrounding the city can instill
students with an inflated sense
of self-importance. Regester
said he has observed this "sav-
ior mentality" among students
and other visitors, and cautions
them to be aware of judgments
they adopt before arriving in the
city.
"It's pretty unlikely that
you're going to save Detroit, but
quite possible that Detroit will
save you," Regester said.
As Schlissel settled into
his new role this summer, he
acknowledged the University's
continued responsibility in facil-
itating interactions between the
campus and city - continuing
the process of educating stu-
dents about the challenges as
well as the opportunities the
city presents. Under his leader-
ship, it does not appear these
efforts will fall away any time
soon.

Unintended consequences
U rankings should take into account other aspects of college life
L ast January, in the midst of controversy at Syracuse
University, incoming chancellor Kent Syverud took a
firm stance stating actions will be taken to improve
the institution's ranking. In a November radio interview, he
stated, "They matter because they affect decision making of
constituencies that matter to universities." While the prevalent
thought on most college campuses questions the methodology
that yields college rankings, the irrefutable truth is that they
matter. Proponents of the rankings say that prestige and funding
are allotted to those who push the envelope and try to leave their
imprint on academia. Adversaries argue that these classifications
aren't a meritocracy but a popularity contest to be part of academic
royalty. While the rankings are estimable in its creation, producers
of college rankings must put forth the effort to provide objective
information that coincides with the interest of all parties included.

Say yes to stereotypes

iles of campaign pamphlets
scatter across campus as
temperatures mimic the
frigid descent
taken by
politicians' tones
as they address
opponents. It's
evident that
election season is
in full swing. For
voters possessing
the desire to MELISSA
acquire more SCHOLKE
information
about potential
options, sifting
through the myriad of pamphlets,
articles and television ads poses a
daunting task. Voters - while they
simply wish to select the candidate
whose platform most accurately
reflects their own interests - risk
ensnarementinsuperficial, partisan
power plays between candidates.
In my brief experience as a spec-
tator and as a participant in the
electoral process, I find it difficult
to recall a campaign unsullied by
mudslinging or ridiculous tactics.
The endless barrage of campaign
literature has fortified my cynicism.
If an ad or article isn't focused upon
attacking a politician, it utilizes
some ridiculous attempt to capture
voters' attention. As a result, I've
embraced the mindset that elec-
tions present a choice between two
imperfect options. Likewise, nega-
tive campaign strategies are inevi-
table, but they shouldn't detract
from the issues. My attempts to
avoid ridiculous campaign litera-
ture were effective until sexism
became a viable strategy.
I'll admit I don't possess author-
ity to state whether or not Repub-
licans are, in fact, waging a war on
women; however, I will say recent
attempts by the Grand Old Party to
attract female voters are extremely

flawed. Considering its reliance
upon stereotypes, it's not surpris-
ing the GOP is experiencing a bit of
trouble attracting this demograph-
ic. The College Republican National
Committee recently released an ad
that reduces women's participa-
tion in elections down to the trivial
debate that occurs in a dress shop.
Utilizingthe tagline "Say Yes to Rick
Snyder," the light-hearted, patron-
izing ad depicts a college grad as she
makes the mentally taxing decision
between two wedding dress styles:
the sleek, "trusted brand" of Rick
Snyder or the "outdated," gaudy
Mark Schauer. The ad alludes to
"Say Yes to the Dress," and perhaps
it was meant to be taken jokingly. At
least, I hope so. If not, the ad begs
me to ask whether members of the
CRNC honestly believe college-
aged women can't comprehend
political matters and can't decide
upon a candidate unless the options
are presented in the superficial con-
text of pretty dresses and reality
TV references.
"Say Yes to Rick Snyder" is merely
one example of GOP strategy laden
with sexism. The wedding dress
narrative was modified with vari-
ous other candidates' information
and displayed in other states includ-
ing Illinois, Arkansas, Colorado,
Pennsylvania and Florida. Michi-
gan GOP officials tried to showcase
their knowledge of female voters
earlier this year. In a tweet this past
June, three male Republican mem-
bers of the Michigan House of Rep-
resentatives were depicted reading
glossy fashion magazines while
state Rep. Peter Pettalia humor-
ously (R-M-106) remarked: "Don't
say we don't understand women."
Understanding women appears to
be important to the GOP, but the
party is demonstrating it horribly.
Even the attempt by Republican
female senatorial candidate, Terri

Lynn Land, demonstrates flaws. Her
ad addresses a comment from her
Democratic opponent, Gary Peters,
who says she is "waging a war on
women." She counters the attack by
silently drinking coffee and check-
ing her watch. She ends this clip by
stating, "As a woman, I might know
a little bit more about women than
Gary Peters." Land provides femal
perspective in a male-dominate
realm, and in some respects, she
probably does know more; however,
biology and political ideology don't
correlate..Land may be female, but
stating women are "more interest-
ed in flexibility in a job than pay"1
doesn't ease voters' concerns about
the wage gap.
Eliminating gendered pay dis-
crepancies is a goal for which I want
elected officials to strive. Currently,
in Michigan, women earn 74 cents
for every dollar earned by a man.
Issues should take precedence over
a candidate's image and amassing
votes. College-aged women possess
a litany of concerns about the qual-
ity of women's rights in Michigan,
and we want candidates who will
clearly state solutions. According
to the Center for American Women
and Politics, voter turnout has been
higher amongst women aged 18-24
than men of the same age from
1998-2012. Women are intelligent
enough to fully comprehend how4
unemployment, education budgets,
right-to-work laws and reproduc-
tive rights affect our futures, and
we understand the consequences
are graver than looking frumpy in
a dress. (Oh, the horror!) If can-
didates truly want to appeal tcg
women, provide serious discussion
and debate rather than presenting
platforms beneath a haze of gossa-
mer, lace and silk.

Todaymore thanever, college rankings have
influence. They have become the standard by
which the quality of educational institutions
is measured. As a result, they promote a
sort of competition between universities
that can be likened to that of a marketplace.
Theoretically, if many competing schools make
a push to improve their offerings, the student
wins. Funding new branches of research or
renovating outdated facilities are some lengths
to which schools will go to attract the best and
brightest students and increase their rankings.
A tangible example of this is right here in Ann
Arbor. According to data from the National
Science Foundation, the University has been
ranked no. 2 in the country in research and
development spending only behind fellow
powerhouse Johns Hopkins University since
2010.
Advocates for college rankings are quick to
point out that schools can also collect massive
amounts of capital to fund any endeavors. In
the 2013 fiscal year, NIH funding at Michigan
was $509.7 million - more than 38 percent of
the University's total research spending. The
rankings also help colleges help their students
long after they've graduated. Job security of
alumni is correlated to school prestige and
having a highly esteemed school on a resume
can be of immense help in the workforce.
Though college rankings do well
compensating institutions that search for ways
to improve themselves, the pervasive thought
among academic leaders aims to reform in the
methodology behind these standings. Today,
many colleges are tightening their admission
standards and are only letting a certain portion
of applicants in with the hope that their
school will jump a few spots in next year's
rankings. As a result of this, universities seem
to be abandoning the less-affluent, lower-SAT-
scoring students in favor of a'superior type.'
While the prominent rankings, like-the U.S.
News and World Report, list names and SAT
scores ofvenerable institutions,this information
pertains to an elite group of students. It fails to
provide pertinent information to the majority,

many of whom are first-generation students.
Professor-student interaction and income for
recent graduates are aspects popular rankings
fail to take into account, chiefly because
such information isn't publicly available and
institutions generally prefer to keep it this way.
An increasing number of schools have recently
said they would like to open their doors to more
people and diversify their student population.
While this is continuously talked about on
paper, it habitually fails to translate to the
real world because of consequences generally
caused by college rankings.
For example, at Syracuse, former Chancellor
Nancy Cantor began admitting students of
lower socioeconomic statuses in an effort to
diversify the school's student body. While this
did achieve its original purpose, it sparked
another issue: Lower-SES students generally
have lower SAT scores and lower GPAs. While
admitting such students can truly expand the
perspectives on campus, doing so can also lead
to a drop in rankings due to the coinciding drop
in the school's academic profile. This could, in
turn, lead to less external funding to support
new undertakings. If the U.S. News and
World Report ranking system were to factor
an important dynamic like diversity into their
methodologies and became less robotic about
number crunching, both schools and their
students would benefit.
Though publications such as U.S. News
and World Report and Forbes provide us with
information that is necessary for today's world,
their intended purpose isn't fully on par with
what schools or students seek today. The way
the system is currently set, measures can be
taken so that it is manipulated. According
to an article in Boston Magazine, "In 2009,
an administrator at Clemson University ...
admitted the school misrepresented financial
information and purposefully rated institutions
lowonthe peerassessments."Inorder forthese
rankings to be taken as a credible source of
information, their authors need to observe how
they are influencing the actions of those who
read them.

Students are right to take a stand on health and safety

You see it at the beginning of
every school year. In that
winding
snake of a line
at Ulrich's the
Monday before
classes, you
see freshmen, '
wide-eyed and
bushy-tailed,
spending exorbi-
tant amounts of ELI
money on text- CAHAN
books they won't
need but were
"recommended" in their syllabi. On
the other hand, you see upperclass-
men, carrying but one folder, two
pens, three packets of flashcards
and four Diet Cokes.
The dichotomy is symbolic:
freshmen anticipate adding to their
"bookshelf" of knowledge, whereas
upperclassmen believe they'll only
need the knowledge the duration of
the semester, and then POOF, out it
goes with the spring cleaning. It's
not that the freshmen are wrong:
in fact, they're completely right in
spirit. But, the upperclassmen know
the practical phenomena of the
classroom: whereby memory cycles
operate on four-week intervals
(unless, heaven forbid, the final is
cumulative). I don't think jaded
is the right word, but I do believe
that this mentality is a product of
the system rather than of the "bad
apples" (as Zimbardo would put it).
How does this work in practice?
Well, we've all experienced this at
least once, now that the first mid-
terms are already over. Class after
class the professor flashes slide
after slide up on the board, address-
ing a lot but explaining little. Con-
cepts are introduced but rarely
detailed. Simplifications are made
for the "ease of student under-
standing." Learning, indeed, is
replaced by such "understanding."
Class becomes the reception of
information rather than the incep-
tion of intuition. Exams, accord-
ingly, often examine regurgitation
over application.
As an analogy: the test is to see
how long you can hold your breath
underwater rather than the demand
of swimming laps.

To make this more concrete, I'll
give an example. As a pre-med,
I've experienced my fair share of
"weeder" classes, and I'll detail one
of them, a 200 level, without using
names. At one point in this class,
we were responsible for memoriz-
ing a suite of specifics regarding
the photo transmission cascade (by
which animals are able to inter-
pret images on their retinas). One
of these regarded the "center-sur-
round" mechanism of retinal gan-
glia (don't worry about it), a quite
complex system to the student
who has not seen it before. I recall
asking a question about the evolu-
tionary nature of this convoluted
system, to which the professor
responded "don't worry about that,
that's beyond the scope of our class.
Just remember what the different
cells are and what they do." In that
moment, the understanding and
appreciation of Nobel Prize-win-
ning physiology had been reduced
to a set of flashcards.
A natural question follows: What
skills are we gaining by this sort of
education, and how will this brand
of education culminate? Once
you arrive at the career fair, the
answers become painfully obvious;
in some sense, school has become
a professional training facility, the
capstone thesis consisting of sign-
ing your name on the dotted line.
Frank Bruni and David Brook of
the New York Times wrote much on
this in early September. As Brooks
puts it, "Instead of being intervals
of freedom, (colleges) are breed-
ing grounds for advancement. Stu-
dents are too busy jumping through
the next hurdle in the resume
race to figure out what they really
want. They are too frantic tasting
everything on the smorgasbord
to have life-altering encounters."
Per Bruni, "As we pepper students
with contradictory information and
competing philosophies about col-
lege's role as an on ramp to profes-
sional glory, we should talk as much
about the way college can establish
patterns of reading, thinking and
interacting..." Both agree that, to
use the rhetoric of a favorite pro-
fessor, we students (via the classes
we take) are too busy snorkeling on

the surface of professional develop-
ment to undertake a true scuba dive
into our interests.
Thissortis asuperficial,removed,
one-size-fits-all education,
delivering information at a rapid
clip to add to our professional
tool belts. It is not the intimate,
progressive self-discovery, which
college should foster. In that
way, I resent the mentality of
the upperclassmen.
I have observed this disconnect
in friends, who amidst recruiting
for full-time jobs, readily admit that
they have no idea what they want
to do. They preface by saying "If I
were to do it all over again ..." I have
too observed this in friends who
have discovered what they want toE
do, yet find themselves defending
against confusion as to why they
didn't take the "traditional route."
It is a strange thing to watch.
Now, I have a question, if you'll
indulge me: How much do you actu-
ally remember from your freshmanl
Psych class? If you're drawing a
blank, studies show that the accu-
racy of your response is likely to
have just as much to do with your
level of interest as with your mental
capacity. If you are like me, then it
was probably the case that youwere
disinterested, because the material
was unrelateable and foreign, sim-
plified and dull. You were just fill-
ing requirements, after all!
Indeed, my favorite class thus far
was the one that causes pre-meds
everywhere to shudder: Organic
Chemistry. It was the only class
I have taken which did not use
slides - only chalk. No class has
been more fruitful, involving or
challenging. Sure, I learned about
nucleophiles and electrophiles,s
aromatics rings and lipid chains,
but perhaps the most important
lesson of all was learning how to
learn and how to think. That bit, I
promise, I won't forget.
And neither will you if you give
yourself the chance. So open yours
eyes, your ears and your mind. I
really do hope you can find yourself
a textbook worth paying for.

Students at the University of Michigan have
rallied this past week to collectively express
their concerns over the Athletic Department's
treatment of quarterback Shane Morris'
concussion. My expectation is that Michigan,
and particularly the NCAA, will understand
the significance of those rallies and finally
adopt standardized concussion management
procedures, including a return-to-play protocol
like the one fought for by players in the NFL.
It was the players, through their union, that
stood up and demanded changes to the way
head injuries are treated in the NFL. Armed
with emerging scientific research linking
concussions to long-term brain damage, the
players insisted that the NFL improve its
policies and practices governing this serious
medical issue. The NFL acted but only as a
result of athletes taking a stand for their own
health and safety.
Independent doctors were finally allowed
on the sidelines to spot, test and treat head
injuries for the first time only two seasons
ago. The fact that neither the NCAA nor the
College Football Conferences have adopted

this standard and other best practices is
unacceptable. NFL players are part of and lead
a union that can demand change, and we know
college athletes do not yet have that luxury.
The NFLPA can hold the clubs accountable
for implementing and maintaining certain
health and safety standards. No such thing
exists in college football, and so far, those who
run the sport have been unwilling to act. The
NCAA has a duty to articulate, not just for the
players and their families, but for the broader
community, the standards the NCAA and the
College Football Conferences are applying to
protect student-athletes.
Our union stands with Ramogi Huma and
the College Athletes Players Association to
once again call for improved health and safety
standards and return-to-play concussion
protocols across all NCAA sports. It is the least
that "student-athletes" deserve, and no health
and safety standard in sport should fall below
that of the professional level.
DeMaurice Smith is the Executive Director of
the National Football League Players Association.

" MIDTERM SEASON: Surviving the struggle
B By Brad Whipple, Weekend Roundup Editor I Photo by James Coller, Assistant Photo Editor

DING DING DING "Time'sup.
Pencils down, please fold up your
tests and pass them down your
row toward the aisle." You flip
to the front page of your exam,
looking at the name of a course
you wish didn't exist.
Among the sporadic thoughts
running through your head
post-exam, one stands out:
What could I have done better
to prepare? Though there's no
single midterm methodology
that a student can follow to
attain success, there are ways to
put you on the right path.
GET A HEAD START
The truth is you will not get
the results you hope for if you
only study on the eve of the
exam. If you're a brainiac who
can, fine. But for those of us who
are not blessed with the ability to
retain information we crammed
within the last 24 hours, the best
approach is to spread out your
learning over a longer period of
time.
Take a few practice tests from
past semesters - which, in my
experience, has proven to be the
most effective way of preparing
myself - do textbook problems,
rewrite any notes you took in
class and look over lecture slides.
If it sounds impossible to
do all that in one night, that's
because it is. So don't.

you're a little misguided.
Make sure to eat breakfast in
the morning, because it's called
"the most important meal of the
day" for a reason. Don't skip out:
fit in some protein, such as eggs,
yogurt or milk, and avoid sugary
foods.
Ifyouhave alate exam, it's also
not abad idea to take a nap during
the day. Make sure you're awake
at least two hours before the
exam, because this will ensure
that you're at your most alert.You
don't want to be taking an exam
in a groggy, post-nap state.
BUY SOME TISSUES
You know, for the occasional
crying that takes place when
you're studying something you
don't understand.
COME PREPARED
Don't be the person asking for
a pencil before the exam. This is
college and you're an adult; if you
forget a pencil, I can't imagine
you're going to do well on the
exam. Bring some water in case
you get thirsty, extra lead in
case you run out and some spare
batteries for your calculator if
your exam requires one.
Exams take an emotional and
mental toll on all students. If you
prepare for them wisely, though,
you'll come out of that lecture
hall with a huge weight off your
shoulders.

HOPE YOU LIKE COFFEE
If you weren't a coffee addict
before college, you'll soon find
out that things change. The key
to late-nighters is any caffeinated
breverage.
Five-hour Energy is not the
way to go, unless you are partial
to drinking poison. Instead, gulp
down a coffee from Espresso
Royale or Starbucks, hunker
down in the Law Library and get
working before you crash.

TAKE A BREAK
In a study , conducted by
the University of Illinois in
2011, researchers found that-
performing a single task over a
long period of time will actually
hinder your performance
and focus. The solution to
overcoming this is to take a brief
intermission from work, which
in the end could dramatically
improve productivity.
With that in mind, take a short

break for every hour you study.
Watch a funny YouTube video, go
for a walk around campus, grab a
bite to eat or fit in an episode of
your favorite TV show. In the
end, you'll feel more energized
and motivated.
GET SOME SLEEP
Getting a good night's rest is
crucial for doing well on an exam.
If you think that pulling an all-
nighter to remember everything
you've learned is a good idea,

@illcomeaspwithit
"I can't even. Study without my pumpkin spice."
@IsThisDoug

You read it right; that time of
year has come. It's time for us
all to pull out our well-written
notes, dust off the books and get
down to business - no matter
how much we dread the idea..
You are all probably wondering
how you will ever learn all the
material in time, especially the
new Wolverines out there. Well,
don't worry, because I am here
to help you.
We all have our own studying
techniques that we prefer and
should keep. I'd just like to
remind you that environment
is key. Before you pull out the
books, make sure you have a
quaint, quiet and comfortable
spot to study. Here are five great
options.
FIRST FLOOR (DANA)
Located in between the
Chemistry Building and Randall
Laboratory, the first floor of
the Dana Building is an ideal
place to study. There are tables
all throughout the first floor,
offering a quiet environment
to get work done. There is a
microwave on the first floor

to heat up some brain food.
For those of you looking for
an unknown gem, the Dana
Building is the right place for
you.
READING ROOM (UNION)
We all pass it on our way to
Starbucks. The Reading Room
is on the right-hand side as you
enter the Union and is a great
place to study in between classes
or for the night. There are plenty
of cozy armchairs and couches
for in between classes and tables
with comfy chairs for long hours
of study. The unique style of the
room provides a spark to light
your motivation.
MEDIA GATEWAY
(NORTH QUAD)
Located just off the right
entrance of North Quad
Residence Hall off East
Washington Street, this study
spot is very open and relaxed
and makes for a great place to
work on group projects or study
with friends. An added bonus
for all of you caffeine addicts,
Java Blu is located right around

the corner to satisfy your need
for coffee.
LAW LIBRARY
For all of you out there who
need absolute silence in order
to be at all productive, this one
is for you. The Law Library is
a great place to forgot Allthe
distractions of the outside world
and get intimate with readings,
PowerPoint presentations and
note cards.
REFERENCE ROOM
(HATCHER)
This room is a perfect
combination of the UGLi and
Law Library. It has long tables
that allow for a study buddy to
keep you focused, but is also very
quiet. Also, there are computers
just outside the Ref Room that
provide a great setting for group
work and gossip breaks.
For those of you with an
upcoming midterm, "I don't
know a good place to study,"
is no longer a good excuse for
procrastination. Check one of
these great spots out and gain
some knowledge.

The WORST
Jesse Klein Weekend Roundup Contributor

As midterms approach and
the Shapiro Undergraduate
* Library gets more full, finding
a good study spot can be harder
than finding a party that same
evening. If you're like me and
have avoided the library so far,
picking your first place to cram
can be daunting.
While it may feel like the
UGLi or the Hatcher Graduate
Library's Reference Room are the
only places to study late, there are
actually many secret study spots
hidden around campus.
Depending on your studying
style, the best place for you can
vary from the quiet of the stacks
to the hustle and bustle of a coffee
house. However, the worst study
spots are pretty unanimous for all.
IN FRONT OF THE TV
While vegging out on the
couch and glancing at your notes
may feel like studying, it's not.
None of the information will

stick in your brain if you are half
focused on a "Seinfeld" re-run.
In fact, just reading your notes
doesn't do much either. Instead,
copy your notes onto a separate
piece of paper and studying will
take you half as long -justinctime
to catch the next episode.
ON YOUR BED
I know some people can study
in their beds, but I usually just
end up falling asleep. Do yourself
a favor and sit in a chair with
good posture and your feet on the
ground.Your test score will thank
you later.
IN YOUR ROOM
I honestly don't know how
people study in their rooms. I
know it's common, but I always
feel like new scenery and a
different environment refocuses
my studying and makes it more
efficient. Also, the walks to and

from the library are great study
breaks.
SECOND FLOOR(UGLI)
It's too loud, there aren't
enough outlets and your friends
are too distracting. This is,
however, a great place for group
studying.
COFFEE SHOPS WITH
BAD WI-FI
While the Internet can be the
best procrastination tool, it is
impossible to study without it and
slow Internet can be a huge block
in a study session. Coffee shops
usually don't have the best or the
fastest Internet. You will just end
up frustrated and accomplish
little to no work.
If you can find a coffee shop
that actually has Wi-Fi, camp
out and order two lattes because
you might not find such a miracle
again.

Sideline protocol challenged

ICE HOCKEY
Michigan to host
final exhibition

By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
Midway through the third
quarter of the Michigan football
team's game against Rutgers on
Saturday, redshirt sophomore
safety Jeremy Clark slowly
came off the field, holding his
left shoulder.
Clark was escorted to the
bench by a pair of trainers where
he was attended to by a handful
of medical professionals.
Assistant athletic trainers Lenny
Navitskis and Phil Johnson
patrolled the sideline "wired
in" with each other and select
medical staff.
Clark's injury, albeit one
unrelated to the head, was one
of the first examples of Athletic
DirectorDaveBrandon'sinitiative
to improve communication
between members on the sideline
put to action.
After sophomore quarterback
Shane Morris was allowed back
on the field despite sustaining
a "probable, mild concussion"
against Minnesota, and wasn't
diagnosed until after the game,
Michigan didn't wait long to
implement the new plan. The
practice is in line with NFL
teams, which have an official in
the booth to better handle head
injuries.
The plan, as Brandon first
described in an interview with
the Daily on Thursday, was to
wire in medical personnel on
the sideline with each other and
someone in the booth to review
plays from above. But not every
trainer had a wire in his ear
during the game.
Of those who extensively
attended to Clark, only one
wore an ear, piece. Navitskis,
who has spent five years with
the Wolverines, patrolled the
sideline, but never spent more
than two minutes at a time
with Clark.

mustered two goals in the third
period and came within inches of
forcing overtime in what could've
been a blowout.
On Monday, there was
responsiveness. Each time the
U.S., Under-18 National Team
Development Program pulled
within one goal of the lead,
Michigan's offense delivered an
insurance goal to keep the game
out of reach.
What the Wolverines (0-1)
haven't shown yet, though, is
a solid start. Through eight
minutes of Monday's exhibition
at Yost Ice Arena, the young
defense looked flustered and
easily beaten, just as it had
in the first 20 minutes of its
regular-season debut in Big
Rapids, Michigan.
Michigan will have one more
chance to work out the early-
game jitters Thursday in its
final exhibition game, against
Wilfrid Laurier.
Michigan is 2-0-0 against
Wilfrid Laurier, a Canadian inter-
university sport school based

in Waterloo, Ontario, with both
wins coming under Michigan
coach Red Berenson in 1999
and 2000. The Golden Hawks
finished the 2013-14 season eight
games under .500, including just
five road wins in 19 contests.
No matter the competition,
though, the Wolverines have
the chance to iron out the early
kinks. Up until the season
opener, coaches were limited to
30 minutes of on-ice instruction,
posing a challenge when
choosingline pairings.
Berenson said he likes the
line of sophomore forward Alex
Kile, freshman Dylan Larkin
and senior Zach Hyman, saying
he expects that combination to
start next weekend against New
Hampshire.
"Games like this are
invaluable," Berenson said. "It's
really important for our team to
get some of these guys off to a
good start."
Exhibitions are also an
opportunity to evaluate
newcomers like defenseman
Sam Piazza and forward Alex
Talcott. Talcott missed most of
the preseason with a separated
shoulder he suffered in August.
Piazza impressed in his
collegiate debut Monday, adding
an assist and a solid presence on
special teams.
Veteran players, too, will get
an opportunity to show their
improvement Thursday. Senior
defenseman Mike Chiasson
will make his first start, while
sophomore goaltender Zach
Nagelvoort gets the nod for a
third time.
"Games like this are
invaluable," Berenson said.
"We're getting a handle on our
young players, but we want to
get a handle on our returning
players as well."

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Michigan coach Brady Hoke has an assistant standing with a headset throughout the entire football game, he explained.

However, trainers took
Clark's helmet away from him
after discussion, putting it in
a new location on the sideline.
But that doesn't mean the
protocol seemed any better, let
alone noticeable, to players and
coaches on the sidelines.
"I think you'll see that, the
effects of that when maybe there
is some sort of head trauma or
something as much as anything.
else," said Michigan coach Brady
Hoke. "I don't - I'm involved
with the game, coaching. I've
never made medical decisions,
so I'm sure it worked OK."
Added redshirt junior
running back Justice Hayes:
"It was the same; same stuff.
(Leaving Shane on the field) was
just a miscommunication, but we
should be allright."

Saturday's game, which saw
redshirt sophomore Willie
Henry come out to have his hand
examined, redshirt sophomore
wide receiver Jehu Chesson exit
with a leg injury and sophomore
running back Derrick Green
break his clavicle, was as good
a barometer as any to measure
how the new policy played out.
Each athlete came to the
sideline after being injured,
unlike last weekend's game.
Only Henry reentered, getting
clearance from a trainer before
rushing to Hoke's side in the
third quarter.
"I think that whole situation
was a big misunderstanding, and
we didn't really have anything
come up like that this game to
reallytalk about,"said sophomore
tight end Jake Butt. "But I know,

they put in a plan and we're going
to get it corrected. We're going to
get the best of the best and get it
figured out."
Perhaps the most noticeable
response to an injury wasn't
with Michigan, but with the
Scarlet Knights. Late in the first
quarter, Rutgers wide receiver
Leonte Carroo snapped back
as he was hit by junior safety
Jarrod Wilson.
Trainers sprinted out to
Carroo moments after he hit the
ground and escorted him off the
field and into the tunnel before
the next play was run.
And trainers' presence on
the field may soon return to
be unnoticed, but Michigan's
handling of Morris's concussion
may have teams paying more
attention.

After the Michigan men's

Fifth-year senior Jordan

5,000 career minutes. It also lost
two captains and another leader
who was one of the program's
best recruits in history.
That leaves the Wolverines
with redshirt freshman Mark
Donnal, true freshmen Ricky
Doyle and DJ Wilson and senior
Max Bielfeldt - who, between
them, have played 195 minutes,
all from Bielfeldt. And it doesn't
help that Wilson and Bielfeldt
both missed significant time
this summer with finger and hip
injuries, respectively.
So who will help shoulder the
load against a physical crop of
Big Ten forwards that includes
Wisconsin's Frank Kaminsky
and Iowa's Aaron White?
Michigan coach John Beilein
gave some indication Thursday
at his first preseason press
conference.
He said Doyle and Donnal
will both play a lot, with
Bielfeldt also getting some time
and Wilson being used as an
"extra option." In addition to
the injury, though, time at the
'3' or '4' positions could take
away from Wilson's minutes in
the post.
"I think there's a chance that
(Wilson) can play any position,"
Beilein said. "We're a long way

even former Michigan forward
DeShawn Sims, he can certainly

With two contrasting styles,
Beilein said he'll use them
situationally down the road, but
that both are flexible.
"I'd need to watch both of
them more, but I think at the
end of the preseason, when we
get into November, one will
probably have an upper hand on
the other," Beilein said. "I can't
make that call yet.
"We may get situational
sometimes, but I wouldn't

or Ricky's outside game. The
perception would be one is one
and one is the other. I think
both of them have the ability to
play the other's game, and that's
what we're working with."

in this series, three daily arts writers in
varying states of mind visit the same
place and write about their experiences.
this week's destination:
Bob's Burgers
OK here we go. This is the beginning. This is going so fast, and every-
one is creepier looking than I remember. I also just mixed C the worst
possible drink in history and I have no snacks downstairs and I'm too
lazy to go upstairs. The irreverent, fast paced comedy still maintains
humor even though a lot of the tropes are overused. So from what I've
gathered, the plot of this episode revolves around Tina and Gene being
in competing middle school musicals, both based on somewhat iconic
'80s movies, "Working Girl" and "Die Hard." There's scheming by Lou-
ise of course, because Louise is always schemey. There are some serious
problems with this episode though. There was barely any Bob or Linda
or TINA for crying out loud, how can you forget the best character of
this show?? There's also a little too much singing in this episode for my
taste, literally every other scene is completely singing?? Boooooo. But
there's a nice moral to the story! Sentimental shit hits hard, even if it is
"Bob's Burgers." I also just forgot how to type a comma.
- DAILY ARTS WRITER



SA nice dance number by a guy who looks like a girl ... It's fine. Why is
this kid singing? Like what is the purpose of this? Working Girl the musi-
cal looks promising I guess. Is time even passing? "Bob's Burgers" is like
a continuous stream of conscious thought... Some Confucius shit. "Wait-
ing is gross" HAHA THAT'S SUCH A GOOD LINE I'M GONNA FINNA
USE THAT FOREVER. What's the blonde chicks name she's so bitchy
it's awesome. They should change the name of the show this literally has
nothing to do with burgers. This is now taking a turn into a NEGATIVE
review. This show kind of is the opposite of good. "It's the boiler room,
it's boiling" wow these characters aren't very bright SMH. Honestly, do
I even have the credentials to judge bobs burgers? I don't even know bob
and I rarely eat red meat. Gene's character development is happening
way too fast OK how is he already the lead role in the musical when I
just met him five minutes ago? He should slow his roll for real and maybe
buy me dinner first before this escalates too quickly. There's too many
musicals to keep track of in this episode honestly the director should've
been more accommodating to me and my limited attention span. Oh shit
everything justgot so sentimental like the music and everything. I might
even feel feelings/emotions!!!! Haha AHAHAHAH just kidding I didn't
because this is "Bob's Burgers." Ooooh OK the sentimental shit was
because they're combining WORKING GIRL AAAAAND DIE HARD
into a musical called WORKING HARD!!!! Cool!!!!.
- DAILY ARTS WRITER

I do like Bob's Burgers, I really do. I think it's funny and creative; and
this, eans a lot coming from a person who really doesn't like adult car-
toons, at all. I truly didn't even know that this show was in it's fifth sea-
son already though, and learning that before watching made me a little
more ctitical since it's easy for shows to lose a lot of the original endear-
ing hutmor after a few years, the kind that Bob's Burgers isiknown for. So
the episode has a musical theme, which sets me off a little bit initially
because I'm not always down with the musical themed episode thing that
some shows tend to resort to. But this is all right! Along with the gagging
going along with a terrible mixed drink and some "what the hells," there
was a good amount of laughing on my end as well as my variously intoxi-
cated co-writers. You got shenanigans from Louise, butt-related com-
ments from Tina and the Belcher family ganging up on that weird school
psychologist. In the end, it was a funny episode and I give the creators
credit for doing a musical-themed episode.

EPISODE REVIEW

Even in its trailer, "The
Affair" setsup whatcouldbe
one of the most atmospheric
series on
television.
Through its
distorted The Affair
lens and pale
color scheme, Sundaysoat10pf
Showtime's Showtime
newest
drama series
promises to be as aesthetically
lustful as its titular romance.
Starring a quartet of actors
from some of television's most
revered works ("The Wire,"
"ER," "Fringe" and "Luther"),
"The Affair" tells the story of
two married couples - one
vacationing, one residing - in
Montauk, Long Island and the
extramarital relationship that

brings themtogether. But the
trailer promises even more;
throughout the two-minute
series preview, a detective
questions the lead characters
regarding the history of their
relationship.
The implications of this
investigation remain a mys-
tery and serve to elevate "The

I
SHOWTIME
Affair" from merely arelation-
ship-centric drama to a tragic
exploration of doomed lovers.
Don't let the unimaginativeness
of the title deter you - "The
Affair" has all the makings of
an intriguing, mature series
worthy of its premiumcable
home.

PAPYRUS
From Page 1B
Our collection was the
brainchild of Francis Kelsey,
a professor of Latin language
and literature at the University
from 1889 to 1927. Kelsey, who
was also an ardent archaeology
enthusiast, is the namesake
of the Kelsey Museum of
 Archaeology on campus.
"It was his idea to start
bringing this material to Ann
Arbor so that students could
work with it here instead of
having to take a .boat all the
way to Egypt to look at papyri,"
Haugsaid.
How the papyri are handled
and stored has evolved over
the years. Haug allowed
me to enter "The Vault," an
environmentally controlled
room used for storing fragile
documents and artifacts. Its
appearance is deceivingly
simple - just a few rows of
shelves, some cabinets, with
cold, sterile air like a hospital
waiting room. However, these
shelves hold thousands of
papyrus fragments,sandwiched
between panes of glass or gently
hugged in acid-free folders.
Other fragments are not
as organized. Back when the
University was excavating
Karanis, archaeologists would
find so many small fragments
that they just dumped them
in whatever containers were
available - along the lines of
tin boxes emblazoned with the
logos of French chocolate and
Egyptian cigarette companies.
Haug opens one for me, and
inside are dozens of jumbled
scraps, like wood shavings
swept up in a workshop.
Fragments like these,
before they can be studied by
papyrologists, must be worked
on by a conservator. The
University collection has two
dedicated conservators: Ulrike
Lau-Lamb and Marieka Kaye,
who must deal with a wide
variety of corrupting elements
on the papyri.
"There's so many things
that might need to be done,
but it is mainly removing dirt
that might be caked on and
obscuring- letters, or fibers
might be misaligned, and
letters can'tbe seen," Kaye said.
Even when the fragments
can be adequately cleaned and
straightened, that they'll even
be intelligible.
"Sometimes there's like
five different pieces scattered
that have to be put together
like a puzzle, and we have
papyrologists that help us piece
it together," Kaye said.
The tools of the trade are
more primitive than one
might think; Q-tips, tweezers,
a miniature bellow to blast a
millennium of desert sand off
of the words. These suffice, but
there's always more upkeep to do.
"You feel like you're never
done, because there's always
more fibers you can straighten,
and just one fiber can make a
difference," Kaye said.
Once the scraps are treated,
they are ready to be studied.
Papyrology can be split into
two sub-fields: literary and
documentary. For literary
papyrology, there's no better

person to talk to at Michigan
than Richard Janko, the Gerald
F. Else Distinguished University
Professor of Classical Studies.
His engagement with antiquity
began during his childhood in
England.
"When I was quite young,

the label is meaningless alone.
"Electronic" is no longer a

be like if someone grouped

Flume and Chet transcend

bridge the gaps between

is forging a new distinct

would be "Drop the Game"

"Broken Boy" (Thief), and
"Streetlight" (Jordan Rakei).

Men's Activism
facilitates dialogue
on misconduct and
respect
By COSMO PAPPAS
Daily Arts Writer
Note on content: includes
discussion of sexual violence and
racism.
While discussions about
sexual assault on college
campuses have too often been
defined by silence, the recent
outcry by students and activists
have pushed a once much-
hushed subject to the forefront.
As of Aug. 13, The Federal
Department of Education has
initiated investigations at 76
institutions of higher education
across the country about their
alleged mishandling of sexual
assault cases. And in September,;
a student at Columbia University
attracted national media
attention for her thesis project
entitled "Carry That Weight,"
where she carries around a dorm
mattress to symbolize the weight
ofthe trauma that faces survivors
of sexual assault. She plans to do
so until her alleged rapist, whom
Columbia previously found
not responsible for the alleged
assault, is expelled.
All this is to say, there are
many - both at an official and
activist level - working to
end sexual violence, and the
Sexual Assault Prevention and
Awareness Center, SAPAC, is
one such organization at the
University of Michigan. SAPAC
is staffed both by professionals
who provide care for survivors
and crisis services, and student
volunteers who work to educate
peers about sexual assault
prevention through group
outreach sessions and SAPAC-
facilitated workshops on
bystander intervention.
Men's Activism is a branch of
SAPAC dedicated to facilitating
these workshops. Founded 10
years ago, Men's Activism works
under the assumption that men,
as the primary perpetrators of
sexual violence, can also play
a critical role in preventing it.
For example, SAPAC is staging a
No-Shave November campaign
where participants will take a
pledge to spread awareness about
one of SAPAC's fundamental
tenets - namely, that "all sexual
activity should be consensual

and come after an enthusiastic
yes," as stated on the website
about the campaign.
"The reality of it is, we're
getting men involved beyond
just taking a pledge," said
Donald Lyons, LSA junior
and co-coordinator for Men's
Activism. "We're trying,
basically, to invite men into the
role of advocates and educators."
Lyons described the difficulty
in mobilizing men for a cause,
which generally does not
affect them directly - though
accordingto astudy, nine percent
of all rape victims are male.
While men are socialized to the
idea that a woman's behavior
or attire determines her sexual
availability and, by implication,
their culpability in sexual
violence, the job of someone like
Lyons or Sarah Hong, LSA junior
and the other co-coordinator
of Men's Activism, is to propel
men into the "'Oh' moment," to
use Lyons's phrase, where they
recognize that the focus should
be on preventing sexual assault
in the first place and not blaming
survivors.
At one of his his recent
workshops with a fraternity on
campus, Lyons went through
several scenarios written
specifically for that organization
as he and the members of the
house collectively detailed the
waysthat they would intervene in
the situation at hand. From there,
they identified the problems and
barriers - physical, emotional
and social - that come into play
when one has taken the step to
take preventative action in that
problematic or violent situation.
"We want to work with
everyone we can, especially
communities of color,
communities that have stories
or narratives that are not what
you see in the whole 'Hail
to the Victors' stuff," Lyons
said. "So now, what we do is
co-facilitation."
"We're trying this new thing
where one person from the
community is co-presenting
with one person from SAPAC.
And the reason we do this is
because we recognize that when
the information is given from
someone within the community
they're more receptive, instead of
them going 'who is this intruder
coming into my community and
preaching down to us,"' Hong
explained.
Part of SAPAC's ethos
is a sensitivity to a partner
community's narratives. The
objective of co-facilitation is

to hand craft a framework for
discussing and confronting
the problems of bystander
intervention in a way that doesn't
rely on blank abstractions
or empty generalities.
Furthermore, this focus makes
clear SAPAC's belief that the best
relationship they can form with
an organization in one that is
creative, collaborative and, most
importantly, enduring. To be put
narratively in the moment when
one is faced with the possibility
of intervention and prevention,
to recognize the barriers to
action in a given situation in
one's own community - this is
what SAPAC aims to impress on
the participants of itsworkshops.
"We are more focused on
groups or organizations on
campus that are more male-
dominated. So in this case, (that
means) fraternities, ROTC,
the Athletic Department. And
we're also trying to reach out
to different culturally diverse
communities on campus because
we recognize the idea of how
masculinity and misogyny are
perpetuated differently based on
culture," Hong said.
This isn't to say that the
volunteers for Men's Activism
end up missing the larger issues
by focusing their work with
specific groups. Part of the work
is contextualizing these discrete
instances of sexual violence
in a broader, more structural
analytical framework.
"Part of what I believe and
what SAPAC believes is that to
talk about sexual assault, you
have to address way more than
someone drugging someone else
at a party. You have to address
sexism as a whole, you have to
address why society devalues
women and objectifies women,
why our society erases or
ridicules people of non-binary
genders." Lyons said. "Beyond
that, you have to go into racism,
why our society devalues and
dehumanizes people of color,
why it is that when people think
about rape they think about the
hyper-sexualized black male."
Sexual assault is a relation
of force, coercion and control
where gender, sexuality, race,
class and all other social
determinants converge. Hong,
Lyons and the volunteers of
Men's Activism attempt to come
to an understanding of sexual
violence with the participants of
the workshop that takes account
of these factors and instructs
them in becoming a thoughtful
and effective bystander.

DailyArts Writer
Jonah Baseball may only
have a few songs to his name on
SoundCloud, but the promising
electronic producer has already
proven one thing: he's certainly
not a one trick pony. There's an
underlying youthful sense of
animation that ties all of his tracks
together and differentiates him
from both rookies and vets in the
field, but otherwise, listeners are
in for a pleasant surprise every
time Jonah releases a new record.
"Everything is influenced by a
sound, and that's never changed,"
Baseball said, "but it's not a
formula where it's gonna be the
same every time and I don't want
it to be either. I don't focus on
that."
While the sound may range
from a raindrop to a shovel
scraping the asphalt, the most
impactful musical influence in
Baseball's life is longtime friend
and fellow producer Lindsay
Lowend.
"(Lowend) came over one day
in 10th grade and showed me 30
loops ... all you need is (30 loops)
and you can make an entire song.
It blew my mind," Baseball said.
And since then, he's been in
a constant state of exploration,
toying with new programs,
reshaping his approach to
composition, and engaging
with online communities.
But during this early stage in
Baseball's career, his hometown
of Washington D.C. wasn't the
hotbed of collaboration that it has
recently become. Being away at
school in Ann Arbor has caused
him to miss out on opportunities
for growth and collaboration with
the budding community of DMV
beatmakers. Nevertheless, he
has managed to establish a name
for himself within Ann Arbor's
electro niche.
"If you make beats, most of us
know each other," Baseball said.
The Beat Battle, organized
by F.O.K.U.S., is how he was
introduced to the community
during his sophomore year. He
got second place his first time
participating and won the entire
competition last year, but the
tournament is more supportive
than it is competitive.
"We didn't care about
the competition, we became

really close friends. It's really
collaborative."
His circle extends beyond the
city's confines, however. He has
support from prominent names
like Wave Racer,RyanHemsworth
and Lito, all influential figures
with a presence in the world of
indie production.
"The biggest thing I did this
summer though," Baseball said,
"was two remixes."
These were specifically for
up-and-coming rapper GoldLink,
an artist Baseball would see
around the studio back home in
DC.
"We would chill and smoke
with him and listen to him rap.
We were all like 'this guy has
definitely got next,' and everyone
wanted to produce for him ... He
remembered me and Tony and
was like 'yo, I want you to do some
remixes.'"
The remix for "When I Die"
that Baseball put together with
Alex Young has garnered nearly
350,000 plays on SoundCloud
already.
New opportunities, like the
recent collaborative work with
GoldLink, are encouraging, but
can be exhausting with a full
load of school work to also be
concerned about. That's why
Baseball has cut back on classes
and is a "part-time scholar,
full-time baller" this semester
(according to his Twitter bio). It
seems like it was the best decision
he could have made.
"I feel much more freedom to
make whatever I want. I have so
many projects that'm revisiting."
His assuring music career
keeps him busy enough anyway.
He'sworking on song execution -
completing a track in its entirety
at a faster pace instead oflingering
on it.
"I'm getting better. I finished
five songs this week."
Then there's the strategy
behind releases to think about.
"I wish I could just put every
song out," Baseball said.
But that wouldn't contribute as
much to his career as say, Vice's
electro channel,Thump,featuring
atrackontheirsite. That's exactly
what happened with the remix of
GoldLink's "Ay Ay" that Baseball
and Lowend created, that Thump
reviewers referred to as "glitched-
out cyborg rap shit that we're all
over."

ensemble includes Josh Brolin,
Owen Wilson, Reese Wither-
spoon, Benicio del Toro, Maya
Rudolph and Martin Short.
With "The Master" and its
disappointing sales generation,
Anderson seems to be steering
himself back toward the main-
stream, with popular actors
and a more straightforward
storyline. Though his typical
strangeness oicharacter, bit-
ing dialogue and period-piece
focus are evident, "Inherent
Vice" reflects Anderson's early
work. We see humor, mystery,
awkwardness, slapstick and
evenfun.
"Doc may not be a do-
gooder," one of the characters
says about Phoenix's protago-

nist, "but he's done good." For
Anderson, this tension of char-
acterhas echoed through each
of his films: what drives bad

Though classes may feel like
an interference to his music
career immediately, there are
experiences Baseball has had in
the music school that contributed
to his long-term vision, the
trajectory he hopes to see himself
follow.
"I was in the Performing Arts
Technologyprogramlastyear and
that wasgreat for me,"he said.
His experiences have
encouraged him to look outside
the: box beyond common career
choices, like DJing, for example.
He sees the importance of making
his art more interdisciplinary,
which is clearly reflected by the
range of songs on his SoundCloud
thut far.
"What they're doing in
academic electronic institutions
is trying to be ahead of the curve,
especially intermsofperformance
art," Baseball said.
This is one aspect that
especially affects his long-term
production plans, as he has
realized that performance art
deserves to be integral in his
career.
"I've definitely had the most
fun performing."
He'llbe performing at the Blind
Pig in Ann Arbor on Oct. 18th
with his band, Which Way the
Train, and DJing after as well,
giving attendees a taste of his
production. Lindsay Lowend,
Yadda Yadda and Tusks are all
set to perform that night as well.
Baseball revealed that he
has been experimenting with
spookier sounds as of late,
hinting at a possible Halloween-
inspired release. Nevertheless,
listeners can definitely expect
new sounds for this year's World
Series, as Baseball continues to
play up his name, one he actually
obtained by accident.
When he joined the high
school baseball team his
freshman year, he was asked
what his name was. "Jonah,"
he replied. But he didn't know
what to say when asked, "Jonah,
what?"
"Somehow I forgot my name,"
Baseball shared.
What ended up coming out
was "Jonah Baseball." Nowadays
all that seems to come out from
Baseball's production efforts
are home-runs, each one with
a distinct style and vibe, but a
grand slam in its own right.
