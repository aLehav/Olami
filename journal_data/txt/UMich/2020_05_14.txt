For the last two months, 
Business senior Ben Lindau has 
not seen anyone except his two 
brothers and parents. 
He 
was 
studying 
abroad 
in Stockholm, Sweden, when 
the University of Michigan 
canceled 
all 
study 
abroad 
programs and President Donald 
Trump declared a suspension 
of all travel from Europe to 
the United States, except for 
Americans who had “undergone 
appropriate 
screenings.” 
According to Lindau, he feared 
he would be stuck abroad, so he 
flew home the next day.
Back in his hometown of 
Chicago which, like many areas 
of the country, was under a stay-
at-home order, Lindau’s life 
was confined to the compact 
apartment that his family had 
recently moved into. Over the 
past two months, Lindau said 
he has only left his family’s 
apartment five times, to “go 
stand outside for 30 minutes.” 
But he acknowledged that even 
doing so posed a risk to his 

health.
“We do have a park we can 
go to, but in walking there, 
everything’s so congested that 
you’re passing a ton of people,” 
Lindau said. “You’re definitely 
in close proximity with a lot of 
people, so it’s difficult to keep 
the social distance.”
Chicago’s Lakefront Trail, 
which borders Lindau’s home, 
has been closed since late 
March. From his living room 
window, Lindau said he can see 
the unoccupied patches of green 
grass that face a crystal blue 
Lake Michigan. He said the lake 
is a sad reminder that he is stuck 
inside.
“That took away pretty much 
all of the green space I could 
use,” Lindau said. “Because 
they closed down that whole 
lakefront, I feel like there’s 
simply nowhere to go.”
Dr. Srijan Sen, an associate 
professor of psychiatry and 
molecular 
and 
behavioral 
neuroscience at the University, 
studies the connections between 
genes, environment and stress. 
He commented on the strain 
that a global pandemic and 
quarantine can have on one’s 
mental health.
“It’s a really unusual time for 

mental health,” Sen said. “We’re 
still gathering data, but clearly 
we see a big increase in anxiety 
and depression, and depending 
on the situations, loneliness and 
social isolation.”
Where someone lives, who 
they live with and how they 
approach stressful situations 
all inform their mental health 
during 
the 
pandemic 
and 
quarantine, according to Sen. 
He noted that it’s a largely 
individualized response.
“It’s a difficult time broadly 
across all of us in the world at 
this point,” Sen said. “But it’s 
definitely going to hit different 
people differently based on their 
own situations and personal 
histories and predispositions.”
Sen said a student stuck 
inside in a city can be equally as 
stressed as a student living in an 
area with lots of nature, but with 
a strained family relationship.
“What your family life is 
like — for some people it’s a 
source of comfort, others it’s a 
source of stress — that really is 
going to affect the experience 
of unexpectedly being back 
home,” 
Sen 
said.

City or suburb, mental health 
impacted by lengthy quarantine

Design by Maggie Wiebe 

More 
than 
300 
University 
of 
Michigan 
community 
members 
have signed a petition regarding the 
University’s sexual misconduct policy 
following last week’s newly released 
Department of Education Title IX 
regulations. The petition has seven 
specific demands about investigation 
time limits, evidentiary standards, 
processes to resolve off-campus assault 
and more. 
The petition was created by LSA 
senior 
Morgan 
McCaul, 
a 
sister 
survivor and sexual violence prevention 
advocate, 
alongside 
student-run 
non-profit Roe v. Rape, a survivor 
empowerment organization. They are 
asking University administration to 
agree to commit to their demands in a 
written statement before June 1. 
In a previous Daily article, University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald wrote it will 
take time to understand how these new 
regulations will affect University policy. 
Fitzgerald reiterated this sentiment 
when 
asked 
whether 
University 
administration plans to consider the 
petition’s demands. 
“We are not able to share anything 
further 
until 
we 
have 
a 
clear 
understanding of the impact of these 
new regulations across several U-M 
policies,” Fitzgerald wrote. 
The new regulations, announced 
last Wednesday by U.S. Secretary of 
Education Betsy DeVos, come after 
her department rescinded Obama-
era guidelines in 2017. According to 


OptiMize aids 
groups responding 
to COVID-19 

Last month, optiMize, a student 
organization offering funding and 
guidance to students leading self-
directed projects, launched its Com-
munity Aid Relief Fund. The $25,000 
fund will provide students with sup-
port for mutual aid and community-
based projects responding to the 
COVID-19 crisis.
Through the fund, students at 
the University of Michigan, Eastern 
Michigan University and Washtenaw 
Community College had the ability to 
apply for a grant up to $5,000 to sup-
port their community project.
Business 
sophomore 
Megha 
Kunju, optiMize storytelling and 
marketing lead, told The Daily the 
organization decided to create the 
fund to support college students 
leading their communities in the 
fight against COVID-19.
“We exist to help students make a 
positive impact in their communities 
and in this moment of crisis, we saw 
so many inspiring examples of stu-
dent leaders and community mem-
bers working on various projects 
to help each other,” Kunju said. “As 
an organization that funds social-
impact projects, it just made sense 
that we would do what we can to pro-
vide some support to these efforts.”
The Community Aid Relief Fund 
granted money to nine projects serv-
ing Washtenaw county through a 
variety of ways, including supporting 
the undocumented community and 
making personal protective equip-
ment.
Kunju said that the mission of 
optiMize is to help students ask the 
question that if no one is stepping up, 
“why not me?” Kunju said the lead-
ers of these nine projects stood out 
to them as people who had asked that 
question. 
“This is their project,” she said. 
“We are just there to support them 
and give them the support that they 
need.” 
LSA senior Lindsay Calka is the 
Vice President of Michigan Move-
ment, an organization that gives aid 
to people experiencing homelessness 
and poverty in the Washtenaw com-

munity. She also works for Ground-
cover News, a street newspaper 
that works to raise awareness about 
homelessness and combat poverty.
Calka orchestrated a “deferred 
donation” from the Community 
Aid Relief Fund through Michigan 
Movement, who then donated the 
money to Groundcover. OptiMize’s 
fund granted $4,200 to this project.
“We are donating on behalf of 
optiMize through Michigan Move-
ment,” Calka said. “Groundcover 
didn’t need care packages like we 
usually do. They just needed money 
because vendors lost their jobs basi-
cally being unable to sell paper on the 
street. And so that was the best call 
that we made, that was just to straight 
up give the money to Groundcover to 
have in their fund for them to allo-
cate to vendors as needed.”
LSA junior Amytess Girgis,co-
founder and co-host of the Mutual-
ity Podcast project, applied for the 
grant. The podcast has since been 
renamed to “Concerning Us: Stories 
of Organizing, Resistance and Resil-
ience.”
“(Since I’m) a college student and 
(my co-founder is) a recent graduate, 
it’s not like we have a ton of money 
lying around,” Girgis said. “When 
we heard that optiMize was offering 
these grants to help folks get projects 
started, we applied right away.” 
The fund granted the Mutual-
ity Podcast $2,000. The soon-to-be-
released podcast aims to propel the 
voices of people doing critical work 
to support the most vulnerable dur-
ing the COVID-19 crisis.
“Without this grant, we wouldn’t 
have been able to afford audio equip-
ment and since we can’t go to the 
U-M libraries right now to use their 
equipment, we needed to get our
own,” Girgis said. 
She also noted that the funding 
has allowed them to offer a stipend 
to the guests that they have on the 
show, as well as to compensate some 
of the podcast’s staff.pandemics so 
that things would be provided for, 
there would be supplies and they 
would have a strategy,” Biden said. 
“Joe would bring together the 
leaders of all nations so we could 
work on this pandemic together 
… that’s what it’s going to take, a 
global initiative.”

$25,000 awarded 
to nine projects

Alumni Association 
seeks to support alumni- 
owned companies

On April 30, the University of 
Michigan’s Alumni Association 
launched a directory of alumni-
owned small businesses to support 
business owners amid the COVID-
19 
pandemic. 
From 
offering 
referrals to making donations, the 
directory includes a running list of 
actions the University community 
can do to support small businesses.
Upasna 
Kakroo, 
Alumni 
Association 
executive 
director 
of marketing, noted the value of 
having a large alumni network 
of 
over 
620,000 
alumni 
in 
strengthening the support and 
collaboration between business 
owners.
“Knowing how much Michigan 
alumni care and want to support 
each other, we hope that through 
the directory they’re able to find 
these 
businesses 
and 
support 
them,” Kakroo said. “Using our 
social channels, we will continue 
to promote the ability to add small 
businesses to the directory as well 
as raise awareness for the directory 
itself.” 
The 
directory 
features 
businesses from across the country 
and in a variety of industries such 
as food service, fitness, law, art and 
broadcasting. One of the businesses 
included is Blank Slate Creamery, 
an ice cream parlor located in Ann 

Arbor and owned by Janice Sigler, a 
1991 University alum.
Blank Slate was closed from 
March 23 to April 23 but received 
an 
overwhelmingly 
positive 
response from the community 
since 
reopening, 
according 
to 
Sigler. 
“We 
have 
adjusted 
our 
operations 
to 
advance 
online 
orders for pints and sundae kits so 
we can reduce the number of staff 
working at one time,” Sigler said. 
“We typically sell out of the pints 
we’ve scooped each day, which is 
great. And we are now producing 
ice cream again.” 
Despite resuming ice cream 
production and being able to 
implement a system of minimal 
contact ice cream pickup, Sigler 
says she and her team miss 
customer interaction. 
“We are in this business to see 
the smiles on customer faces when 
we hand them an eye-popping 
dessert or their favorite flavor,” 
Sigler said. “So that’s been a really 
hard adjustment.” 
Another business on the list is 
Frameable Faces Photography in 
West Bloomfield, owned by Doug 
Cohen, 1992 University graduate, 
and his wife. Since the studio’s 
closure, the couple have shifted 
their focus to photo restoration, 
photography training via Skype and 
Zoom, and consulting with clients 
on past and future photo sessions. 
Cohen stressed the importance of 
maintaining their online presence 
now more than ever.

David Moran, clinical pro-
fessor of law at the University 
of Michigan and co-founder of 
the Michigan Innocence Clinic, 
delivered a webinar to almost 
200 law students and community 
members Tuesday morning. He 
discussed the goals of the Michi-
gan Innocence Clinic as well as 
recent exonerations the clinic has 
achieved. 
The 
Michigan 
Innocence 
Clinic, founded in 2009, aims to 
investigate cases where there was 
no relevant DNA evidence in the 
conviction. Law School students 
are involved in the clinic’s work 
through investigating cases while 
gaining hands-on law experience 
and credits..
“There is no DNA test, espe-
cially since in the United States 
crimes 
are 
usually 
commit-
ted with firearms,” Moran said. 
“And so if you shoot somebody 
as opposed to stabbing them or 
strangling them, you’re especially 
unlikely to leave behind biological 
evidence.”
Moran also discussed three 
recent cases that the clinic has 
successfully handled. The first 
case involved the wrongful con-
viction of Desmond Ricks, who 
was accused of murdering his 
friend Gerry Bennett outside a 
burger joint in Detroit.
Moran explained how after 
Ricks 
witnessed 
his 
friend’s 
murder, he ran home, dropping 
his jacket and wallet. The police 
discovered Ricks’ address and 
showed up at his home to find a 
gun, which they claimed to be the 
murder weapon.
Years later, the Detroit Police 
Crime Lab was exposed for fraud-
ulent 
bullet-to-gun 
matching. 
Moran explained how the clinic 
used the lab’s malpractice to help 
exonerate Ricks.
“The Detroit Police Crime Lab 
was shut down after an audit 
was done by the Michigan State 
Police,” Moran said. “And what 

that audit showed was that in 
the 
firearms 
ballistics-match-
ing unit in particular, there was 
widespread misfeasance, and in 
fact, they were matching bullets 
to guns where they didn’t really 
match.”
As a result of the discovery, 
Moran explained how Ricks’ case 
was reopened and he was eventu-
ally released from prison after 25 
years. He received compensation 
for wrongful conviction and was 
able to reunite with his family, 
according to Moran.
Another recent case involved 
the murder of an 11-year-old 
girl, Jodi Parrack, in Constan-
tine, Mich. According to Moran, 
Ray McCann was wrongfully 
convicted of murdering Parrack 
after he suggested searching the 
cemetery and Parrack’s body was 
found there shortly after. McCann 
claimed he was innocent, yet the 
Michigan State Police contin-
ued to question him, lying to him 
about having DNA evidence and 
videos to prove his guilt.
Moran went on to discuss how 
while McCann was spending time 
in prison, Daniel Furlong, a fel-
low community member, tried to 
abduct and murder a young girl. 
The girl got away and the police 
called Furlong in for question-
ing. Furlong confessed he was 
responsible for the murder of Par-
rack and that he felt safe enough 
to do it again due to the police’s 
intense focus on McCann. Moran 
explained how he exposed the lies 
the detectives told McCann after 
Furlong’s confession.
“So instead of doing the right 
thing at that point and realizing 
that they had hounded an inno-
cent man for all these years, the 
police actually went to the pris-
on where Ray McCann was held 
and told him that Daniel Furlong 
had just been caught and had 
implicated Ray McCann as an 
accomplice,” Moran said. “Again, 
another complete lie.”

Over 1,750 University of Michigan 
students, faculty and community 
members signed a petition aimed at 
protecting graduate students amid 
the COVID-19 pandemic. The letter 
calls for the University to provide 
an emergency stipend to all gradu-
ate students, support international 
student visa issues, extend degree 
requirement deadlines and health 
insurance eligibility, among other 
measures.
Graduate students have been 
affected by the pandemic in multiple 
ways — from the closing of labs that 
left many students concerned about 
graduating on time to worries about 
finding a job during an economic cri-
sis.
Jeff Lockhart, Graduate Employ-
ees’ Organization member, said see-
ing graduate students at universities 
like Yale and Harvard demand simi-
lar protections inspired the caucus 
to draft a letter with reasonable 
demands. 
“We spent quite a bit of energy try-
ing to figure out what other universi-
ties were doing,” Lockhart said. 
The initial letter was sent to a 
group of graduate students for feed-

back and was later released to the 
public on May 1. The Daily published 
an op-ed by the GEO’s COVID Cau-
cus calling on the University to sup-
port the health and safety of graduate 
students.
Lockhart said he hopes they won’t 
face resistance on the demands, 
including requests such as represen-
tation of graduate students on the 
provost’s committees.
“We feel the graduate students 
need to be represented in the room 
as a voice as part of that decision-
making process,” Lockhart said. 
The Daily reached out to Pub-
lic Affairs Associate Director Kim 
Broekhuizen, who declined to com-
ment and said via email they would 
“respond directly to those who sent 
the petition.”
Rackham student Nishita Trisal 
discussed how the University made 
announcements 
for 
undergradu-
ate students, such as the Pass/No 
Record Covid grading and tenure-
track extensions, but there had been 
no mention of graduate students. She 
said there needs to be University sup-
port for people finishing their Ph.D.s 
in addition to help at the departmen-
tal level.
“I think these (COVID-19-related 
challenges) kept emboldening us to 
feel like we need to make the case 
for broader protections that aren’t 
just based on the benevolence of this 
administrator here or there,” Trisal 
said.
Rackham student Theodore Nash 

signed the petition because of the 
challenges he is facing as an interna-
tional student during the COVID-19 
crisis. Nash felt compelled to leave a 
testimonial when he signed the peti-
tion to express the importance of 
these issues.
“I now face profound uncertainty 
as to when I will physically be able to 
return to America,” Nash wrote. “I 
sign in solidarity with all those who 
faced unexpected expenses (espe-
cially if they were unlucky enough 
to go through the Rackham funding 
process — which takes a good amount 
of emotional energy — and have their 
request denied) and others who are 
stuck in their home countries facing 
that same uncertainty.”
Rackham student Paloma Contre-
ras addressed the financial issues she 
is facing in her testimonial. 
“We don’t receive funding over 
the 
summer,” 
Contreras 
wrote. 
“These are four months in which I 
will not be receiving a stipend, and 
as an international student, I won’t 
receive the stimulus check issued by 
the government. On top of that, many 
of us don’t receive tax exemptions 
that U.S. citizens do receive. Coming 
from a working class family, my par-
ents and brother do not have access 
to health care in my home country, 
and the three of them are currently 
unemployed. How am I supposed to 
survive financially?”

Graduate Employees’ 
Organization demands 
support from ‘U’


M

ore than seven weeks have 
passed since Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer issued Executive 
Order 2020-21, urging all Michigan resi-
dents, except essential workers, to stay 
home to combat the spread of COVID-
19. Life on campus had already been 
uprooted, with classes being moved 
online and University President Mark 
Schlissel urging students to return 
home if they were able. All non-essential 
businesses were closed, jobs were lost 
and some local businesses even closed 
their doors permanently due to financial 
turmoil. Decreasing numbers of new 
cases of COVID-19 in Michigan and 
recent protests against stay-at-home 
orders have sparked a conversation 
regarding whether we are ready to loos-
en restrictions and begin reopening our 
state’s economy. This leaves University 
of Michigan students wondering what 
we can expect for the fall 2020 semester. 
Schlissel has spoken of having a 
“public health informed fall semester,” 
with ideas being thrown around to hold 
large classes online and smaller classes 
in person. This would include urging 
students to wear masks and reducing 
student density in campus buildings. 
His announcement followed news that 
the University’s losses from the pan-
demic could range from $400 million 
to $1 billion. Since other universities 
in Michigan have already announced 
plans to have online classes in their fall 
semesters, Schlissel’s optimism to open 
campus again seems to be somewhat 
financially motivated. However, since 
a vaccine for COVID-19 won’t be avail-
able for at least a year, it is crucial that 
we rebuild our campus infrastructure 
to allow for high-quality learning while 

still taking the proper precautions to 
keep our students and faculty safe. This 
is precisely what the University is trying 
to do. 
If the University makes an effort to 
enforce social distancing in classes held 
in person, decreases student density in 
campus buildings and asks students to 
wear masks on campus, returning to 
campus could be feasible. However, an 
issue arises when considering social life 
on campus. The school may ban large 
gatherings, but they lack power when 
it comes to off-campus gatherings and 
nightlife.
In public health, when we cre-
ate interventions meant to better the 
health of the public, we evaluate the 
amount of individual effort needed. 
Interventions that depend more on 
individual participation are less effec-
tive than those which rely on gov-
ernmental authority. For example, 
executive orders that are more strict 
with their stay-at-home requirements 
and qualifying essential businesses 
would be more effective than simply 
asking people to stay home. In context, 
this means that keeping campus closed, 
holding classes online and urging stu-
dents not to move back to Ann Arbor 
would be more effective than asking 
students to follow the recommended 
guidelines. Since this doesn’t seem to be 
financially practical for the University, 
I believe Schlissel wants to do what he 
can to open campus and bring students 
back. This means that we, the students, 
hold the responsibility of reducing the 
spread of COVID-19.
Whether we agree with prioritiz-
ing University finances during the 
pandemic, we all can admit that we 

would love to return to some kind of 
normal. As students who just lost half 
of a semester and already miss their 
campus and friends, doing our part to 
reduce the spread of the virus is going 
to be incredibly difficult. We are all 
desperate to return to school, see 
our friends, go to tailgates and enjoy 
what is left of our college experience. 
We will want to throw parties, go to 
Rick’s and enjoy a game day. 
As a rising senior, I feel this too, 
but as a public health student, I’m 
afraid that opening campus and 
bringing tens of thousands of stu-
dents back to Ann Arbor is a danger-
ous idea. Many of us will care more 
about having these college experi-
ences than we do about hypotheti-
cally getting ourselves or someone 
else sick. We think that it will never 
actually affect us, and if it does, our 
youth and health will protect us 
from severe illness.
Unfortunately, there is still so much 
we don’t know about the virus. People 
in their 30s and 40s have been suffer-
ing severe strokes caused by COVID-
19. Many of the impacts the virus can 
have on younger, healthy populations 
are still unknown. Because of this, we 
cannot just assume that our campus 
population is young, healthy and able 
to survive the virus without serious
complications. We must consider our 
peers who are immunocompromised, 
our older faculty, staff and the sur-
rounding Ann Arbor community.

What we can expect for Fall 2020

T

he University of Michigan’s 
Board of Regents is consider-
ing revisions to Bylaws 5.09 
and 5.10, which have to do with the 
demotion or dismissal of faculty mem-
bers. The bylaws are the University’s 
legal constitution — they are an expres-
sion of our values, just as the U.S. Con-
stitution expresses American national 
values. It is thus of great concern to 
me, and to many other University fac-
ulty, that some of the proposed changes 
weaken academic freedom and erode 
the institution of tenure. The University 
should be a leader in supporting these 
institutions, not undermining them. 
Last fall, I was asked to join a work-
ing group of faculty to make recom-
mendations for revisions to Bylaws 
5.09 and 5.10. Though never officially 
acknowledged, it seemed clear that at 
least some of the impetus for revisions 
came in response to a recent 5.09 case 
that involved an allegation of sexual 
assault. 
Under the existing bylaws, a faculty 
member charged under 5.09 continues 
to receive their salary and benefits until 
the proceedings come to a conclusion. 
Thus, it can happen — as it did in that 
recent case — that a faculty member 
accused of a heinous crime receives full 
compensation while the formal 5.09 
process unfolds over several months. 
(We were told that a typical 5.09 case 
can take about nine months to com-
plete, though many end sooner through 
faculty resignation.)
I am as unhappy as anyone to see fac-
ulty members apparently guilty of seri-
ous crimes compensated with public 
funds during a lengthy dismissal pro-
cedure. But, the operative word here is 
“apparently”: To protect those who 
are innocent despite the appearance of 
guilt, we need a robust due process in 
every case, particularly in the case of 
tenure — the closest thing we have to a 
sacred institution at modern research 
universities.
The proposed revisions allow for 
a process occurring simultaneously 
with the main 5.09 hearing that would 
allow the president, under certain cir-
cumstances, to suspend the salary of 
an accused faculty member before the 
main hearing comes to a judgment of 
guilt. There are many problems with 
the proposal such as augmenting the 
president’s power over the proceedings, 
no compensation if found not guilty, 
poor definitions, racial bias and lack of 
protection for non-tenure track faculty 
altogether. But, arguably the greatest 
problem is the very possibility of sus-
pending pay prior to the completion of 
the main hearing. 
Such a provision violates the fun-
damental principle of “innocent until 
proven guilty.” Assuming that the main 
5.09 hearing includes the robust due 

process we believe necessary for dis-
missing a tenured professor, then why 
should anything less be acceptable for 
removing pay, the main intention of 
tenure? 
Allowing the president to suspend 
pay all but gives the president the power 
to fire a tenured faculty member at will 
— exactly what tenure is meant to guard 
against. Imagine that a faculty member 
writes public op-eds about a controver-
sial political issue. The University may 
come under fire for the op-ed, even if 
the contents are protected under the 
First Amendment and by the principle 
of academic freedom. The University 
may suffer declines in alumni dona-
tions, and the president might decide 
it would be best to remove the faculty 
member. Digging up an unverified 
anonymous complaint, the president 
could then invoke 5.09 and suspend pay 
(it would be easy enough for someone 
with the authority of the president to 
find three committee members willing 
to go along with the decision). Without 
pay, the faculty member might not be 
able to eke out a living, much less sus-
tain the legal fees required to mount an 
effective defense against the Universi-
ty’s well-funded legal team. They might 
give up and resign or lose in the hear-
ing, even if innocent. I do not expect 
that any reasonable president would 
do such a thing, but one reason we have 
bylaws at all is to protect against arbi-
trary authority and the abuse of power. 
And unfortunately, abuses of power 
do happen. Bylaw 5.09 was added in the 
aftermath of the McCarthy era, when 
three University of Michigan faculty 
members — Chandler Davis, Clement 
Markert and Mark Nickerson — were 
suspended, with Davis and Markert 
eventually terminated, for acting on 
their conscience and refusing to tes-
tify before the House Un-American 
Activities Committee. The Univer-
sity was subsequently censured by 
the American Association of Univer-
sity Professors, the foremost institution 
representing faculty at American uni-
versities, and the bylaws were instated 
in response. The AAUP continues to 
recommend that major sanctions such 
as suspension of pay “should not be 
imposed until after a hearing in which 
the same procedures apply as in a 
dismissal case.” The proposed bylaw 
revisions go against this AAUP rec-
ommendation, against the practices 
of most of our peer universities and 
against the original spirit in which the 
bylaws were enacted.

Keep tenure protections robust

OP
OPINION
ON

A

s the semester winds down 
while the weather warms up 
across the state, it’s easy to for-
get that we are in the midst of a global 
pandemic. But while the pandemic may 
have slipped our minds, it certainly hasn’t 
escaped that of Gov. Gretchen Whit-
mer, who announced the extension of 
her stay-at-home order through May 28. 
This decision has garnered severe back-
lash, both from her constituents and the 
Republican-controlled Senate in Michi-
gan, and has even brought the Michigan 
political landscape under the searing eye 
of national politics. 
But Whitmer is no stranger to sending 
ripples through national politics, having 
delivered the democratic response after 
President Donald Trump’s State of the 
Union address back in February. Now 
she is rumored to be a potential running 
mate for Joe Biden. Recently, Whitmer 
has also been the subject of Trump’s 
infamous Twitter tirades, and has been 
labeled “that woman from Michigan.” 
Beyond her involvement in politics, how-
ever, Whitmer displays an unwavering 
commitment to the safety and wellbeing 
of Michiganders, demonstrated by the 
extension of the emergency order, regard-
less of political backlash.
Whitmer’s approach is one that takes 
the best interest of Michiganders into 
account and is done so out of genuine 
compassion for her constituents, not polit-
ical gamesmanship. Nevertheless, she has 
faced harsh criticism from politicians and 
protestors in Michigan’s capital alike. Just 
because these critics can’t witness first 
hand the catastrophic havoc wreaked by 
the virus doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. 
After all, any issue that preys thousands 
of Michiganders’ lives should transcend 
party lines and amass unilateral support. 
Unfortunately, the political landscape in 
America is so marred by divisive discord 
and blind ignorance that many are unable 
to expand their views to consider more 
than themselves. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown 
the ever-widening chasm of political dis-
parity into focus, and, rather than being 
an agent to catalyze unity, it has only 
served to worsen these tensions. This 
is not a time to be restrained by political 
ties but rather a time to come together 
in solidarity to solve the issue at hand. 
In refusing to budge in her approach to 
the pandemic when human lives are at 
stake, Whitmer intends to do just that. It 
is refreshing to come across a politician 
who genuinely values human lives and 
is undeterred in the wake of backlash. 
Unfortunately, these qualities are incred-
ibly rare, the highest office in America 
being corrupted by the antithesis of 
the qualities displayed by Whitmer. In 
response to Whitmer refusing to com-
promise by opening the economy at the 

cost of lives, Trump urged Whitmer to 
“give a little, and put out the fire.” Nev-
ertheless, Whitmer holds steadfast in 
the wake of a political storm, refusing to 
lower herself to political quibbles when 
Michiganders’ lives are at stake. 
Her actions in response to the corona-
virus pandemic prove her a leader well 
equipped to deal with a crisis (namely that 
she won’t urge citizens to ingest chemi-
cals) and demonstrate a selflessness and 
genuine concern for her people that make 
her a great governor and a praiseworthy 
politician. But, unfortunately, Whit-
mer has become the latest scapegoat in 
Trump’s pattern of blaming others for his 
blunders. While she should be heralded 
as having her constituents’ best interests 
at heart, instead she is falling victim to a 
sick double standard present in politics, 
wherein women are criticized harshly for 
doing the same thing that men do. After 
all, how is Whitmer’s approach any dif-
ferent than Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s in New 
York? Sure, New York has more cases, 
but with Michigan still within the top 10 
states with the most cases, Whitmer is 
simply heeding Cuomo’s warning as “the 
canary in the coal mine.” 
On top of criticism from Trump, 
Whitmer is facing criticism in Michi-
gan’s capital of Lansing. Michigan saw 
its largest protest yet, dubbed Operation 
Girdlock, with many gathering outside 
the Michigan capitol building. The nar-
rative these protestors have adopted 
is one that criticizes Whitmer’s lock-
down, saying it jeopardizes their liberty 
and infringes on their constitutional 
rights. These protestors seem to argue 
that, because they personally haven’t 
witnessed the havoc caused by the 
coronavirus, they shouldn’t be inconve-
nienced by its effects. 
These protests have even been com-
pared to Rosa Parks’s infamous protest 
during the Civil Rights Movement by 
the Trump administration. Apparently 
what these valiant protestors fail to 
realize is that a crucial part of the Civil 
Rights Movement was nonviolence, 
which their possession of assault rifles 
directly contradicts. Also, it is impossible 
to equate systematic racial oppression 
to government intervention designed to 
safeguard the health and wellbeing of 
an entire population. Furthermore, the 
fact that swastika and noose flaunting 
protestors are being compared to Rosa 
Parks is a testament to the gross igno-
rance that festers in the White House. In 
addition, many protestors flouted Whit-
mer’s guidelines, not social distancing 
and not wearing masks.

Q

uarantine has left mil-
lions of teenagers, includ-
ing myself, in search 
 of ways to fill their time 
while socially distancing. Some 
have turned to painting, Zoom 
calls, cooking or learning to play 
new instruments. However, one 
of the most popular ways young 
people are escaping boredom is 
through the social media plat-
form TikTok. With endlessly 
entertaining minute-long clips, 
it is easy to lose track of time on 
the app. While it can be a fun 
and creative platform, it can be 
extremely dangerous for mental 
health and body image, espe-
cially with such a young audi-
ence. 
“In terms of its difference 
from other social media, it 
does not stop,” LSA sophomore 
Shubhum Giroti said. “On Ins-
tagram or Facebook, you fol-
low what you follow and then at 
some point, you reach repeated 
content and get off the app. The 
difference with TikTok is that 
it literally doesn’t stop. You can 
spend one minute or 12 hours 
in a row on it. I think that it is 
extremely unhealthy.” 
A unique feature of TikTok 
is the For You Page. The FYP is 
made up of content recommend-
ed for the user based on algo-
rithms that determine what that 
user likes to see. By consistently 
displaying new content, it has 
become one of the most addic-
tive social media platforms. LSA 
sophomore Megan Shohfi claims 
that “it is the most addicting app 
(she has) ever had.” 
If the algorithm is based 
on what viewers like to see, it 
should be things they are inter-
ested in and want to see and 
have a positive impact on men-
tal health, right? Unfortunately 
not. For many people, the vid-
eos that they might spend more 
time watching are not healthy. 
For example, Shohfi’s FYP is 
made up of lots of health and fit-
ness videos. However, she notes, 
she often sees an “unhealthy 
diet culture. The way that some 
influencers use TikTok to pro-
mote unhealthy eating habits 
frustrates me because younger 
girls probably see that and think 
that it is normal. I see things like 
only drinking water for break-
fast and extreme diets.” 
It is hard to control which 
videos hold our attention. Many 
videos on my FYP promote 

unhealthy habits as well. I find 
myself watching them because 
I am so shocked and confused 
about how they are real. What 
TikTok sees, however, is that I 
am taking the time to watch the 
full video. Therefore, more vid-
eos like this appear on my FYP. 

TikTok has a very young 
audience. Nearly 40 percent of 
users in the United States are 
teenagers or younger and more 
than 25 percent are in their 
20s. Many users are in their 
formative years and are at risk 
of being heavily influenced 
by social media. The intense 
diet culture of the app has the 
potential to begin or intensify 
body image issues for all users, 
but can especially affect young-
er teens who are already going 
through a period of higher inse-
curity and confusion. 
When 
interviewees 
were 
asked about the typical famous 
TikTok male and female, very 
different 
descriptions 
were 
used. The typical female was 
described by all as skinny, 
white, good looking, good at 
dancing and usually showing 
lots of skin. On the other hand, 
the typical male was described 
as average and funny. My 
12-year-old brother once said to 
me, “girls just have to be pretty 
and wear a bikini” when dis-
cussing how to get famous on 
the app. 
I am a strong believer that 
women should be able to wear 
and do whatever they want in 
their posts. However, many 
young females are getting the 
impression that what soci-
ety values are their bodies 
and looks. When they see that 
famous females are skinny, 
pretty and happy, they may 
think that they would be hap-
pier if their lives were more 
similar to those famous TikTok 
users. “A lot of famous TikTok 
people are famous because they 
are good looking and seem to 

have fun lives,” LSA sophomore 
Benjamin Servetah said. “It 
seems like their lives are bet-
ter and it can cause you to feel 
worse about yourself.” 
Social media allows people 
to only present the best ver-
sions of themselves. Users wit-
ness beautiful, skinny, famous 
people that seem happy and can 
feel bad about their own situa-
tion. The possibility that any-
one can reach fame on the app 
is exciting, but it also means 
that those who do not get many 
views or likes may feel that the 
community 
is 
disapproving 
of them and that they are not 
attractive or funny enough. 
The app has many fun and 
interesting features. As with 
any social media platform, 
people 
can 
express 
them-
selves and relate to others. 
Even the dancing culture has 
positive features, as dancers 
have found an outlet to share 
their talents. From painting 
to cooking to fitness, TikTok 
allows people to be creative 
and gain recognition for their 
talents. However, there are 
little to no positive impacts on 
mental health. Even famous 
TikTok users have begun to 
speak out about the massive 
amounts of hate and judgment 
they receive on their bod-
ies and choices. Addison Rae, 
one of the most famous female 
TikTok 
dancers, 
recently 
spoke out on Twitter about the 
body-shaming comments she 
receives after being compared 
to a whale multiple times on 
the app.
The app has the potential 
for 
creativity 
and 
spread-
ing positive messages that 
could potentially help men-
tal health. For this to become 
reality, however, users must 
be aware of their interactions 
with the app to maximize the 
benefits. If people stop liking 
and giving attention to videos 
with negative ideas about body 
image and unhealthy messag-
es, those videos will gain less 
traction and show up on fewer 
people’s FYP. The culture of 
the users must change for the 
app to change. Awareness and 
a conscious effort to spread 
positivity can put TikTok in 
the right direction.

If you listened to country radio any 
time in the last six months, there’s a 
good chance you heard one of Justin 
Bieber’s latest singles. Alarming, I 
know, but thanks to country duo Dan 
+ Shay, Bieber can claim a hit country 
song with their collaboration “10,000 
Hours.” A mushy-gushy, country 
lite ballad dedicated to their wives, 
“10,000 Hours” epitomizes the latest 
trend to sweep mainstream country 
music — “boyfriend country.”
Coined by Tom Roland in Bill-
board, “boyfriend country” is what 
you’d expect to hear over a compila-
tion video of rustic wedding decor. 
Beige and flowery, its lyrics compile 
a scrapbook of stock photo memories 
— picture-perfect picnics, candle-lit 
dinners, walks on the beach. Like 
wedding cake, boyfriend country is 
sugary and frequently bland. It’s no 
wonder, then, that “The Bachelor” 
franchise has made use of the sub-
genre. Boyfriend country staples like 
Russell Dickerson, Chris Lane and 
Matt Stell have all serenaded couples 
on the show. 
In a genre that prides itself on 
being “real,” boyfriend country is 
often less “dreamy” and more nause-
ating. Its idealism and soft pop pro-
duction are convenient entryways for 
outsiders, resulting in country’s most 
generic — and popular — duets. It’s 
a disheartening, foolproof formula. 
Pop stars like Bieber, and their coun-
try counterparts, score a quick num-
ber one hit on the country chart with 
slightly acoustic-sounding pop songs. 
Take Jimmie Allen and Noah Cyrus’s 
single “This is Us” for example. The 
chorus says nothing in so many 

words: “but it was just you and that 
was just me / before we found love / 
now this is us.”
From around 2011 to 2015, songs 
about tailgates, beer and trucks, also 
known as “bro country,” dominated 
country radio. Comparatively, boy-
friend country is bro country’s sappy, 
straight-laced older brother. In some 
cases, however, the “bro” himself has 
merely grown up. The seeds of boy-
friend country were not sown by pop 
stars, but country music’s own. One 
of the sharpest, most telling career 
pivots was taken by Thomas Rhett in 
2015. Rhett went from singing about 
a girl “shakin’ that money maker” in 
his first hit “Get Me Some of That” 
to being content with holding hands 
on his biggest hit “Die a Happy Man.” 
Fellow bros of Florida Georgia Line 
got the hint and started worshipping 
their wives with their 2016 single 
“H.O.L.Y.” Shortly after, other bros 
like Jason Aldean and Cole Swindell 
followed suit. 
Still, boyfriend country’s roots 
extend past the tidal wave of bros-
turned-boyfriends. Lovestruck pop 
country itself isn’t new. Lonestar’s 
“Amazed” from 1999 fits the bill. 
“Wanted” by Hunter Hayes was a 
massive hit in 2012, right in the mid-
dle of bro country’s rise. It’s worth 
noting though, that Hayes’s career 
did end up suffering for arriving a 
trend or two too early. Nowadays 
a higher voice, boyish looks and a 
youthful glow can carry male coun-
try singers far. Brett Young’s resem-
blance to a Hollister model has made 
him the poster child for boyfriend 
country stardom. 
Obviously, love songs aren’t inher-
ently bad. And, despite its tendency 
toward gooiness, boyfriend country 
isn’t either. Like candy, sweet and 

sappy pop country songs sound good 
in moderation. In fact, male artists’ 
sensitivity can be refreshing when 
it’s done right. What’s frustrating is 
when boyfriend country is the only 
sound that’s given a platform. And 
what’s bad is when this sound grows 
increasingly more homogenous. A 
song like “10,000 Hours” already 
sounds like the conglomerate of many 
shallow, boring love songs — we don’t 
need 10,000 more.
As you may have noticed, I haven’t 
mentioned a single female country 
artist throughout the entirety of 
this article. Country radio has the 
same problem. Women have been 
hovering around 10 percent airplay 
for years. Despite being marketed 
as a Band-Aid for the way women 
were portrayed in bro country, boy-
friend country actually makes coun-
try radio’s gender problem worse. 
Instead of playing more women, the 
exclusion of female country artists is 
now the work of songs that claim to 
“respect” them. This issue is bigger 
than boyfriend country, but “sweet” 
songs by men certainly don’t make 
women in country any less voiceless. 
Laying country radio’s gender 
politics aside, it’s normal in country 
music to bash what’s played on the 
radio and long for the sounds of the 
past, the “authentic.” Memes wish-
ing for the return of bro country have 
already begun circulating the Inter-
net. A back-and-forth in the popular-
ity of certain styles and themes is also 
to be expected, not just in country 
music, but any art form. All this is to 
say that, like any subgenre, boyfriend 
country has its share of both thought-
ful and careless content. My advice? 
Find the trendy songs you like and 
enjoy them while they last. The pen-
dulum will swing sooner or later.

On ‘Boyfriend Country’

KATIE BEEKMAN
Daily Arts Writer

In April 2016, author, his-
torian and professor Ibram X. 
Kendi published his Nation-
al 
Book 
Award-winning 
“Stamped from the Begin-
ning.” In what he subtitles 
“The Definitive History of 
Racist Ideas in America,” Ken-
di’s exhaustive research chron-
icles the timeline of anti-Black 
racist ideas and their shifting 
power throughout American 
history. 
Kendi, one of America’s 
leading antiracist voices, was 
the 
youngest-ever 
winner 
of the National Book Award 
for Nonfiction in 2016. The 
same year, Jason Reynolds’s 
“Ghost” was nominated for the 
National Book Award in Young 
People’s Literature. This pres-
tigious celebration of the best 
literature in America is where 
the two men met.
But, it wasn’t until March of 
this year, nearly four years later, 
that “Stamped: Racism, Antira-
cism, and You” was released — 
the remix of Kendi’s original 
book, reimagined by Reynolds. 
In an interview with “CBS This 
Morning,” Reynolds reveals 
that he initially declined Ken-
di’s request to write the remix: 
“I said no because I’m careful 
about tampering with things 
that I believe are sacred.” Yet, 
he finally agreed when he real-
ized “this work was bigger 
than the both of us, and it’s not 
about either one of us.” 
Reynolds’s remix is geared 
toward a younger audience, 
readers 12 and up. While Kendi 
is a scholar who holds a posi-
tion as the Director of the Anti-
racist Research & Policy Center 
at American University, where 
he is a professor of history and 
international relations, Reyn-
olds is a writer of books and 
poetry for young adults and 
middle-grade audiences. On his 
website, Reynolds declares that 
he plans to “not write boring 
books.” He goes on to say that 
“I know there are a lot of young 
people who hate reading… but 
they don’t actually hate books, 
they hate boredom” — which is 

one of the initial obstacles he 
faced with the remix. 
So Reynolds, who has said 
that young people don’t like 
to read history books, decided 
that his remix wasn’t a history 
book, “but a book about the 
present: here and now.” 
Like Kendi’s original ver-
sion, Reynolds structures the 
book using five historical fig-
ures: Puritan minister Cotton 
Mather from the 17th century, 
founding father Thomas Jef-
ferson, 
abolitionist 
William 
Lloyd Garrison, writer and 
activist W. E. B. Du Bois and 
radical activist and writer 
Angela Davis. The division 
of the book into five sections 
coincides with the five guides, 
spanning from the 1400s to 
modern day. While that encom-
passes over 600 years of his-
tory, Reynolds’s remix caps at 
248 pages, half of Kendi’s 500-
page original. 
Another important similar-
ity in the remix is the three 
different 
definitions 
used 
to identify and describe the 
people 
explored: 
segrega-
tionists, assimilationists and 
antiracists. These three cat-
egories are repeated frequently 
throughout the book, helping 
us to understand the histori-
cal figures represented along 
with their motives and beliefs 
(which we often discover to be 
contradictory). 
Reynolds simplifies the defi-
nitions to help young readers 
grasp the complex material, 
calling segregationists “hat-
ers,” assimilationists as “the 
people who like you, but only 
with quotation marks” and 
antiracists as “the people who 
love you because you’re like 
you.” Later, when discussing 
figures like Abraham Lincoln, 
it was helpful to have these 
definitions as we approached 
his contradictory views — like 
that he wanted slavery gone, 
but didn’t think Black people 
should necessarily have equal 
rights: an assimilationist. An 
assimilationist I found I knew 
very little about.

It’s said that every theater is inhab-
ited by at least one ghost and contrary 
to legends propagated by Hallow-
een, these ghosts do not like the dark. 
Thus, when the curtain falls and a 
theater’s house empties, an employee 
will leave a light — a ghost light — to 
burn onstage until the performers 
return. Across the world, ghost lights 
have remained on and untouched for 
months. But the lives of performers 
continue offstage, each day adding 
pressure to find performance spaces 
on digital platforms. What happens 
when the ghost lights keep burning 
and we’re left with a stage wholly 
mediated by posts, shares, comments 
and likes? 
I recently opened a message from 
my best friend that was a response 
to a picture I’d sent her of the Ann 
Arbor sunset. She’d quickly typed a 
heart eyes emoji, meant to encapsu-
late her reaction to the beams of soft 
light that glinted through the fresh 
spring leaves of a tree on Geddes 
Avenue. In the chat, we continued a 
small conversation. “I’ve really got-
ten into light lately,” she said, tell-
ing me about the strings of morning 
sun that burst through a window in 
her Massachusetts home. I thought 
about my own morning when I had 
lay in bed, half awake, luxuriating in 
the warmth of sunlight that pierced 
through my apartment’s window 
and onto the lower half of my legs. 
“Me too,” I told her. 
As Michigan wakes up from a 
notoriously cloudy winter, the new 
rays of light appear as unbelievable 
beings between timid blooms of 

flowers and trees. Our state and our 
world remain cloistered under the 
dark wrath of an ongoing pandemic, 
but the sun and its growing days are 
blissfully unaware — springtime 
happens even in war. 
In 2008, Christopher Wheeldon 
made a ballet that chased after this 
thought: “Within the Golden Hour” 
weaves together 14 dancers in an 
architecture that wavers between 
fast and slow, large and small, ani-
mal and human. Initially inspired 
by artwork from Gustav Klimt, 
Wheeldon based his choreography 
in Klimt’s use of golden light. The 
dancer’s movements are airy and 
sometimes intangible, creating a 
sense of the sublime — a concept that 
inspired many of Klimt’s contempo-
raries. When the work was restaged 
for the Royal Ballet in 2016, Jasper 
Conran added costumes of diapha-
nous netting with reflective rect-
angles sewn into a middle layer. The 
result is a shimmery construction of 
fabric that reflects each movement 
onstage. In essence, the dancers 
become beams of light themselves. 
In the piece, three lead couples 
complete central sections of vary-
ing energies and four background 
groups braid themselves into undu-
lating structures behind them. The 
seven couples weave in and out of 
each other’s shapes, never stopping 
and never static. They move both 
simultaneously 
and 
individually, 
calmly switching between the two 
to create a spectacle of subtle bril-
liance. Ezio Bosso’s music matches 
the movement in a dynamic sense of 
exploration. By the end of the clips 
found online, it quite fittingly feels 
as if my screen could erupt in shining 
golden light. All told, the work feels 

like a spring bloom that buds new 
connections and sends life through 
newly constructed architectures of 
life. 
“Within the Golden Hour” hasn’t 
gotten much attention lately. Among 
the growing list of ballets being 
uploaded and live streamed by com-
panies desperate to share their art 
and gain much-needed attention, 
this piece hasn’t been one of them. 
This statement is born less from 
frustration and more from oppor-
tunity. It may seem like the work 
is less accessible than those pieces 
found on YouTube or Instagram, but 
the memory of “Within the Golden 
Hour” manages to still feel quite 
relevant. Its message of explora-
tion, growth and light feels eternally 
responsive to the human condition. 
Even when limited to a few archi-
val clips and new technological 
divisions between the artist and 
the observer, “Within the Golden 
Hour”’s themes remind me that a 
piece of dance can remain relevant 
even as its visual presence tempo-
rarily fades. 
Lives are stripped bare right now. 
We’re existing in a polarity of fear 
and hope, left with little to distract 
us from our position between the 
two. We will need a lot of newness to 
move on — new medicine, new jobs 
and new normals. But some things 
will stay the same. Springtime will 
bloom and sunshine will weave its 
way through new leaves. Flowers 
will move in the newfound warmth 
of the sun just as humans will dance 
as we begin to rebuild. From afar, 
“Within the Golden Hour” con-
tinually teaches us of our own con-
nection to such light and celebrates 
what it means to be alive.

I’ve 
been 
having 
a 
hard 
time keeping track of time, but 
Goodreads indicates that it took 
me just under two weeks to read 
“Pride and Prejudice.” For some 
reason it feels like longer. Or 
maybe not? Time is passing in 
strange ways now. Maybe it’s that 
everything I do now has a greater 
tendency to completely fill my 
field of vision. When I decided 
to read Austen’s classic, it was all 
I really wanted to do. Her long, 
intricate sentences seemed to take 
up my entire brain. 
My housemate, who is the kind 
of person who read these novels in 
her adolescence, lent me her copy. 
It’s one of those ugly-but-useful 
Dover Critical Editions that has a 
bunch of essays and an eye-water-
ingly extensive bibliography in 
the back. She told me she’s read it 
six or seven times and you can tell. 
Her marginalia is that of some-
one with a real affinity for the 
material, as well as someone who 
knows what’s going to happen 
almost by heart. When Wickham 
tells Elizabeth his (misrepre-
sented) life story, my housemate 
filled the margins with skepti-
cism. “Consider how unusual at 
the time it would be to just say all 
of this directly to someone you 
just met,” she wrote. Elizabeth 
says something similar later on: 
“She was now struck with the 
impropriety of such communica-
tion to a stranger, and wondered 
it had escaped her before.” My 
housemate’s experience of this 
book reminds me of Zadie Smith’s 
analogy for rereading: like walk-
ing into a house whose rooms 
you know very well, and you can 
see clearly the placement of the 
objects and their relationships to 
each other. 
Elsewhere, 
my 
housemate’s 
annotations 
are 
enthusiastic. 
“OMG he is so bad at this,” she 
writes next to Darcy’s awkward 
attempts to converse with Lizzy 
Bennet. “Awful,” she writes next 
to one of Mr. Collins’s ponder-
ously 
misogynistic 
speeches. 
Austen is a writer who inspires 
this kind of immediate affinity, 

fandom even, in a way that a lot 
of other literary writers don’t. I 
wanted to share this affinity, but I 
couldn’t. Even though I felt a sort 
of affinity for her style and meth-
ods, I never felt fully absorbed by 
it. This is, of course, my fault and 
I immediately felt bad about it. I 
don’t really care about the canon, 
not exactly, but it does bother me 
a little bit that when someone 
asks me what my favorite novel 
is, I will answer with something 
published in the last 5-10 years. 
Uh, “My Year of Rest and Relax-
ation”? Maybe “Conversations 
With Friends”? I could lie and say 
“The Last Samurai.” That’s a book 
that people who want to be writ-
ers are allowed to have as their 
favorite, I think. It’s not that these 
are not good books, but it’s that I 
feel a little bit of shame at their 
topicality. They feel like news 
items and therefore whatever the 
opposite of edifying is. Of course, 
it’s not that I haven’t read “Jane 
Eyre” or anything, it’s just that 
I am not the kind of person who 
loves that kind of thing. 
What is “that kind of thing,” 
anyway? Maybe it’s the ethos 
Austen depicts. Her characters—
mostly the lower end of the gen-
try who are, in their own way, 
precariously situated—spend a lot 
of their time visiting each other. 
They are constantly coming in 
and out of each other’s houses, 
being entertained in rooms spe-
cifically designed for the purpose, 
having conversations and judging 
each other’s conversational abili-
ties. Conversation is like a game 
for these people: they are always 
trying to impress other people 
and (sometimes) trying to be fair 
and judicious in their own assess-
ments. Darcy, who pretty early on 
refuses to dance with anyone at a 
ball and barely speaks to anyone, 
is met with such universal disdain 
by the Hertfordshire set because 
he basically confronts the con-
cerns that animate these people’s 
lives and says “no, thank you.” No 
one seemingly dislikes him more 
than Elizabeth Bennet, who, as 
we know, ends up with Darcy in 
the end.

An Idealistic, Outdated America

On March 14, an Asian-American 
family of three was stabbed by 
Jose Gomez at a Sam’s Club. On 
February 23, Ahmaud Arbery was 
shot dead after being followed by 
Gregory and Travis McMichael, 
who had grabbed their shotguns 
and pursued Arbery in their truck. 
On September 17, 2019 Harris 
County Sheriff’s Deputy Sandeep 
Dhaliwal was shot twice in the 
head by Robert Solis as he was 
returning to his patrol car during a 
routine traffic stop.
These cases are not political; 
they do not require the public to 
pick between red and blue, left or 
right. They are hate crimes which 
shake up the very core of American 
ideals 
and 
values. 
It’s 
about 
humanity. Cases such as these beg 
the question: Is a need for justice 
not inherent within all humans? 
Are descriptions of these gruesome 
cases not enough to spark empathy 
and activism across all American 
households? After all, these heinous 
crimes occurred on American soil, 
the land of the free — but not free 
enough where people of color can 
feel safe going grocery shopping, go 

on a run or do their job. 
As an Indian American growing 
up 
in 
a 
typical 
Midwestern 
suburban household and attending 
public schools, I was always taught 
to salute the law and order in place 
to protect our communities and 
swell with pride when it comes 
to revisiting our nation’s history.

Colorism: Seeking fairness in Southeast
Asian communities

PRISHA GROVER

When I was little, I never 
understood why my mom used 
to bathe me with warm milk and 
honey. Or why her friends (the 
aunties) would often remark on 
how light my skin is. Or why Fair 
and Lovely whitening cream was 
always in high demand at the 
Indian grocery store. As I grew 
older, my friends and I began to 
spend more time outside — joining 
after school sports clubs and biking 
around our suburbs. As a result, 
we became more tan and more and 
more aunties would comment on 
how I had become so kala, which 
means dark. It’s become a mark of 
beauty, especially in North Indian 
communities, to be light-skinned, 
meaning that becoming darker 
made us seem less attractive. 
Recently, Netflix released the 
first season of the show “Never 
Have I Ever,” the story of the

While I feel privileged to be living 
in this country, as I grow older I 
question whether I’ve looked at our 
past through rose-tinted glass and 
how that affects my perception of 
our present and future.
The answer lies largely in the 
United States education system 
which perpetuates an idealistic, 

outdated vision of America. I 
was taught the oppression of an 
entire race of people, yet I was 
never informed of the years of 
generational trauma that would 
linger 
into 
my 
young 
adult 
years. I was taught racism and 
discrimination 
are 
wrong, 
yet 
was never directed to systemic 

instances 
of 
racism 
prevalent 
within institutions like education, 
healthcare and the justice system. 
Students sitting in public school 
classrooms are becoming more 
diverse, yet educators rarely hold 
discussions on how to combat the 
social issues which may lie in their 
future.
Racial equality should be an 
integral 
part 
of 
conversations 
in all communities of diversity 
and injustices of the past and 
present should be at the forefront 
of our depictions of American 
history. To bring about this wave 
of understanding, schools need 
to 
have 
greater 
transparency 
of the American narrative of 
continual racism and oppression. 
Racism and discrimination need 
to be defined and explained to 
students at younger ages. There 
should not be any hesitation in 
addressing these topics, as this is 
not political but rather about our 
existence. To believe that racism 
and discrimination will one day 
be eradicted is foolish, but to 
acknowledge past and present 
wrongs is not.

high 
school 
sophomore 
Devi 
Vishwakumar who must navigate 
her life after her father dies and 
seeks to rebrand herself. Despite 
the truth, Devi is not marketed as 
attractive or charming. Instead, she 
is made to seem like a moderately 
attractive awkward nerd who is 
desperate for approval from a boy 
— putting effort into outfits that 
clearly do not match and being 
clumsy in almost any scene where 
she seems attractive. In contrast to 
her characterization, her cousin, 
Kamala, is fair and has glowing 
light skin, and is always depicted to 
be naturally beautiful and talented, 
having men fall all over her for her 
beauty. 
This show, while an extremely 
beautiful stride in representation 
in media for young Southeast 
Asian Americans, easily plays into 
this age-old notion that light skin 
tends to equate to beauty. This is 
not a new practice — when famous 
Bollywood Actresses became well 

known in American pop cultures, 
such as Deepika Padukone and 
Priyanka 
Chopra, 
they 
were 
notably made to look lighter with 
their makeup. Even in Bollywood, 
actors and actresses such as Kajol, 
Bipasha Basu, and Rekha are all 
darker in person. However, on TV 
and in movies, they are made to 
seem much lighter through the use 
of makeup. 
The 
origin 
of 
this 
notion 
associated with fair skin can be 
traced back to Euro-centric beauty 
standards. A dissertation written 
by a University of Massachusetts-
Boston graduate explains these 
standards as praising “fair skin, 
long straight hair, thin lips, [and a] 
small nose,” comparing people to 
the most prominent physical traits 
of a white woman. This comparison 
is unfair, considering that these 
traits are not normal for so many 
different 
ethnic 
communities. 
Several Indian women are blessed 
with rich, dark skin, but are 

constantly rejected by the Indian 
public, modeling agencies and 
Bollywood casting groups.

It’s 1996. The door of the ‘88 Volvo closes 
with the gentle push of a chestnut-brown, 
smooth hand. The discounted Macy’s black 
leather left heel steps forward. With a less 
assertive movement, the right follows. Back 
and forth, with pseudo-confidence, the heels 
click in a straight line up the driveway, as 
thick, silky black hair moves behind in uni-
son. With each step, my mother looks up 
from her petite stature. Her bright brown 
eyes closely monitor how her heels touch 
the pavement, while refraining from sway-
ing her lean arms; instead she learns to hold 
them steady against her side. She looks up at 
their home in a middle-class, simple Atlanta 
suburb and exudes all the confidence she 
can. Stand tall. Walk with purpose. Be con-
fident. They need you as much as you need 
them. My father’s calming, rational voice 
echoes in her head as she practices. At the 
age of 29, my mother was learning how to 
walk like an American.
In 1993, my Amma had just immigrated to 
the United States from India to marry and be 
with my father. In the following three years, 
she had my older brother, studied for and 
passed her Step 1 and Step 2 Medical Exams 
and began to prepare for residency inter-
views. After volunteering at Emory’s hos-
pital, she quickly noticed how people in the 
U.S. walked differently from her. In India, 
women hold the pallu (sash) of their saris in 
their right hand, keep their left close to their 
body and glide. “Here, women were swing-
ing their arms when they walked — it’s just 
different in jeans.” Every night after getting 
back from her shift, she would practice walk-
ing up and down the driveway, deliberately 
monitoring her movements to prepare for 
the American professional environment.
Changing the way she walked was only

fasts recipes hoping you are able to feel

one part of the adjustment. She would lis-
ten to hours of NPR to learn the American 
accent, took notes on how to eat baked pota-
toes and other American foods to avoid look-
ing confused during interviews and learned 
how to have small talk about Christmas 
dinners and the Fourth of July. Although 
seemingly minor, these adjustments were 
difficult; in her resilience, my mother has 
become a strong American medical profes-
sional. 
These adjustments took small forms in 
her everyday life, but the hardest moments 
were those she could never get back — miss-
ing her grandparents’ funerals, the births 
of her nieces and nephews and the aging of 
her own parents. Immigrating left her with a 
feeling of irrelevance in the lives of those she 
loved and a longing for her simple life back in 
India. I remember our conversation when I 
asked her what she imagined her future life 
would be like at my age.
“When I was 20, I — hm. I imagined 
myself practicing there.” She said before she 
paused “I didn’t see much more than taking 
care of the family’s daily needs, wanting to 
be around family, being in the culture you 
identify with.” Her emphasis on family stung 
me, especially knowing that my brother and 
I will never be able to replicate those bonds 
with her loved ones while growing up oceans 
away. “I never thought I would live some-
where else, never.”
This myriad of experiences has defined 
her life into two chapters. As she and my 
father raised us, they became more engaged 
in American lifestyles, putting their stron-
gest cultural inclinations to the side for the 
sake of our ability to “fit in” to our New York 
suburbia, where we have lived for the past 18 
years.

‘Alla familia’: Ben Cirella’s family’s restaurants spread the love

Two weeks ago, Ben Cirella 
pulled his silver Volvo up to the 
entrance of Elmhurst Hospital in 
Queens, N.Y.
Elmhurst has been at the 
epicenter of New York City’s 
disastrous COVID-19 outbreak. 
Queens has 56,719 confirmed 
cases of coronavirus, the most 
of any city borough, and has 
recorded nearly 6,000 deaths. 
After 
being 
overrun 
by 
a 
ballooning 
number 
of 
cases 
and facing ill-timed equipment 
shortages, the hospital was forced 
to expand its Intensive Care Unit 
capacity by 500 percent back in 
April.
Alongside his brother, Brad, 
and 
sister, 
Alex, 
the 
junior 
defenseman stepped out of the 
car, put on proper personal 
protective equipment and made 
his way over to the hospital’s 
doors. In their hands, the Cirella 
children held trays containing 
a smorgasbord of fine Italian 
cooking 
from 
their 
family 
restaurants’ kitchens — a gift of 
gratitude to the essential medical 
personnel 
who 
have 
worked 
tirelessly to care for COVID-19 
patients.
The Cirella family owns three 
restaurants in the Long Island 
area, and like many restaurant 
owners, 
the 
Cirella 
family 
have been offering takeout and 
delivery for customers ever since 
the pandemic forced them to 
close their restaurants’ doors to 
in-person dining. 
But Dean Cirella, Ben’s father, 
has decided to take things a step 
further, enlisting his children 
and workers to cook and deliver 
catering platters to hospitals 
that have been overwhelmed by 
COVID-19. So far, Ben and his 
siblings have delivered food to 
seven hospitals in the New York-
Long Island area. Dean even 
offers a joint-venture initiative 
to his regular customers; if they 
want to donate food to a local 
hospital, the Cirella’s will cover 
half of the bill and deliver it for 
free.
For Ben, his family’s effort 
is simply them doing their part 
— the only way they know how, 
with food and kindness — to 
help mitigate the stress of the 
pandemic.
“I don’t do enough,” Ben said. 
“I’m an essential worker and 

‘hero’ because I’m delivering 
food but that’s nothing. It’s not 
hard compared to what these 
nurses and doctors are doing, so 
that’s why I love giving back to 
them and seeing their smiles. It 
makes my day and hopefully it 
makes their day.”
Community service has never 
been a chore for Ben. In fact, he 
has always thoroughly enjoyed it.
This past year, the Michigan 
men’s lacrosse team logged the 
most community service hours of 
any varsity sport. Every Monday 
night, the team went up to the VA 
Hospital in Ann Arbor and played 
bingo 
with 
veterans. 
Every 
Tuesday night, the team visited 
Mott’s Children’s Hospital and 
spent time with patients and 
their families.
And every time, Ben was there.
Like other Michigan student 
athletes, Ben spent the past 
month-and-a-half wrapping up 
his classes online, completing 
at-home workouts and searching 
for an internship. But when Ben 
returned home in March, despite 
an already hectic schedule, he 
made sure to find time to help 
out at the restaurants. Even if it 
meant listening to team Zoom 
meetings while simultaneously 
delivering orders, Ben knew he 
owed it to his dad to lend a hand.
Running 
and 
building 
a 
successful, 
multi-generational 
and multi-restaurant business 
did not come without long days 
and nights filled with hard work 
and sacrifice. 
Summers were the busiest time 
of the year for the restaurants, 
particularly 
Surf’s 
Out, 
a 
restaurant in Fire Island, and 
Dean almost always had to be at 
one of the restaurants. Yet with 
Ben as a highly-touted recruit, 
his summers were jam-packed 
with lacrosse tournaments, so 
it was nearly impossible for 
Dean to find time to drive him 
to tournaments and watch his 
games. Ben’s mother, Caryn, also 
worked at the restaurants, but 
navigated her busy schedule to 
make sure her son could attend 
all of his games.
“It means a lot (to me to give 
back),” Ben said. “My dad is the 
hardest worker I know. There’s 
a lot of businesses struggling 
right now and my dad is doing 
everything he can to keep our 
restaurants afloat. To give back to 
him, it just means everything. He 
would do anything for anybody 

without asking for anything in 
return. … I’m willing to jump on 
it as quickly as I can and help out 
any way I can.
“I think it’s like an extra 
workout — (something like) 
working on Fire Island as a 
barback and carrying all that 
ice.”
Ever since Ben was six years 
old, he has helped out in some 
form at the Cirella’s restaurants. 
It was where we grew up. When 
he was little, Ben went from 
table to table and took pictures 
of customers on holidays like 
Valentine’s Day and Mother’s 
Day. On Christmas Eve, Dean 
dressed himself up as Santa Claus 
and the kids as Santa’s elves. 
When Ben was older, he spent his 
summers at Surf’s Out working as 
a barback or busboy. 
“We didn’t have a beach house 
growing up and that was fine 
because (Surf’s Out) was our 
beach house,” Ben said. “We 
would go out there, hang out 
at the beach all day and then 
go work at night. (My friends) 
always beg me to this day to come 
to Fire Island and hang out at the 
restaurant and beach.”
And after a childhood of 
experiences in restaurants, Ben 
wants to enter the restaurant 
business, just like his father and 
grandfather.
“I just kept the restaurant in my 
blood,” Ben said. “(The business) 
has been around for 30-plus years 
and we still continue to make 
customers 
happy 
with 
every 
order...That’s what I want. I want 
to continue to spread and grow 
the family and happiness.”
“As has been the case for 
nearly 60 years,” reads Cirella’s 
website, “we’re sure that once 
you experience the authentic 
Italian flavor of Cirella’s — for 
lunch or dinner — you’ll become 
‘alla familia’…one of the family.”
In a period of such fear and 
uncertainty, the Cirella’s have 
made a deliberate effort to take 
care of one another.
“It’s cool being with my family 
through this all,” Ben said. “Since 
we’re all together, it definitely 
takes a load off the shoulders a 
little bit. It’s nice when I’m doing 
these long deliveries that I can 
look over and see my brother in 
the car next to me helping out.”
But more importantly, to the 
Cirella’s, to be ‘alla familia’ 
extends beyond the immediate 
family. Frontline workers and 

loyal customers are also ‘one of 
the family’ and equally deserving 
of care in their eyes. And just as 
the Cirella’s have made the effort 
to help others, their customers 
have 
returned 
the 
favor 
by 
consistently ordering food.
“During this time, it proves 
what family we really have,” 
Ben said. “Just like we’re trying 
to support hospitals and our 
neighborhood, they’re supporting 
us by ordering dinner and giving

On September 14, 1998, Janine 
Smith gave birth to her second child, 
Natalie. Three days later, she was back 
on the bench coaching, with Natalie at 
her side.
Right off the bat, the pair’s 
relationship and the game of volleyball 
were intertwined.
It had to be. At the time, Janine was 
a Division I coach at the University of 
Texas at Arlington and taking a season 
off wasn’t an option.
Her husband, Warren, did what 
he could. He was a stay-at-home 
father and he took care of their eldest 
daughter, Brooke, who was just 15 
months older than Natalie. But as a 
newborn, Natalie needed to be with 
her mother.
So she was.
“Natalie traveled with me,” Janine 
said. “She was with me 24/7 for a good 
three months.”
And with a newborn attached to 
her hip, Janine coached the Mavericks 
to a respectable 24-7 record, going 19-1 
in the Southland conference.
After three months filled to the 
brim with volleyball, time away 
from the other half of the family and 
pandering to the needs of a newborn 
baby, Janine turned over some of the 
parental supervision to Warren that 
January. 
For the first time since she was 
born, Janine and Natalie weren’t 
together.
***
Janine was born and raised in 
Dubuque, Iowa – a volleyball town. To 
the north was a big volleyball school, 
Dubuque Wahlert, the place where 
she would first truly get to prove 
herself.
During her time at Wahlert, she 
helped bring home two championship 
banners and made enough of an 
impact to be inducted into the Iowa 
Athletic Hall of Fame for her success 
at the high school level.
But her athletic achievements didn’t 
stop with volleyball. In track and field, 
Janine found a way to, quite literally, 

rise above the competition — she was a 
high jumper. In her final three years at 
Wahlert, Janine became a three-time 
state champion at the event.
Her final high jump win came in 
1988, the same year she started her 
volleyball career at the University of 
Texas, Austin.
And that year, she couldn’t help but 
just keep winning. 
The Longhorns were senior heavy, 
and no matter how good Janine 
was, she wasn’t going to start as a 
freshman. But Janine didn’t let that 
hold her back.
“I didn’t know what kind of impact 
I was going to make,” Janine said. 
“But … I was going to make an impact 
no matter what. And whatever it was 
going to take, I was going to find my 
way on the court.”
She started the year as a defensive 
specialist. There was no libero 
position in volleyball at that time, 
so the defensive specialist fulfilled 
that role. She remained there until 
one of the seniors suffered an injury, 
sidelining them for most of the season. 
Again, Janine had a chance to prove 
herself.
Stepping into her new role nicely, 
she became a six-rotation outside 
hitter for the majority of the season, 
racking up experience and honing her 
game the entire way.
But towards the end, the senior she 
took the place of recovered, retaking 
her position and relegating Janine to 
her back-row duties. That didn’t stop 
her from making an impact. Instead, 
she earned the moniker ‘Super Sub,’ 
for her prowess as a rotational player.
In the NCAA Tournament, Texas 
faced an undefeated UCLA in the 
semifinals. The Longhorns didn’t back 
down. 
“I had a pretty good Final Four,” 
Janine said. “That’s why they say 
that they call me the ‘Super Sub,’ 
because when I came in, I made a lot 
of defensive plays to help keep us in it.”
UCLA fell in straight sets, albeit 
close ones, and Texas moved on to face 
the defending champions, Hawaii. 
Janine kept her play up, subbing in for 
sophomore Quandalyn Harrell in the 

back row and sometimes staying in 
for a full six rotations when the coach 
needed her to. 
After three sets, the Longhorns 
were national champions, Janine the 
‘Super Sub’ an integral part of the win.
“I was just kind of in the zone,” 
Janine said. “I was pretty focused 
and wanted it for the seniors who had 
worked very hard and who had been 
mentors to me as a freshman.”
Over 
the 
next 
three 
years, 
Texas never made it back to the 
championship, only going as far as the 
regional finals, but Janine cemented 
herself as a star.
She is seventh in Texas history in 
both career kills and service aces, as 
well as second in career digs, leading 
the team in digs in 1989, ‘90 and ‘91.
In her senior year, Janine was 
finally able to compete in the other 
sport she excelled at in high school — 
high jump. 
Due to volleyball, she wasn’t 
allowed to high jump for her first four 
years at Texas. But her eligibility had 
ended, so she was free to join track 
and field, something the track coaches 
wanted her to do much earlier in her 
college career.
Another member of the Texas 
track and field team was her future 
husband, Warren Smith, a pole vaulter 
for the Longhorns.
Soon after graduation, the two 
were married. A short time after they 
tied the knot, Janine received a call.
At the opposite end of the line was 
Colorado head coach Brad Saindon. 
The Colorado volleyball team was 
new, having just started in 1986, and 
had yet to see much success. Saindon 
wanted Janine to be one of his 
assistant coaches, barely a year after 
she finished playing at Texas.
“He said he wanted me because 
he says that I single handedly helped 
our team beat them,” Janine said. “He 
wanted me to be on their team as a 
coach to help his kids.”
Janine and Warren knew it was a 
leap, but they wanted to take it.
That year, Colorado won their first 
Big 8 championship ever, beating out 
perennial powerhouse Nebraska.

After her first year in Colorado, the 
UT-Arlington head coach position 
opened up. Janine decided to throw 
her hat in the ring for the sake of 
experience. In the future, she’d need 
to know how to interview and go 
through the process of applying for 
coaching positions, so it was a great 
opportunity to start building that 
foundation. In the interview, she was 
offered the job on the spot. After just 
one year as a limited earnings assistant 
coach, she became the head coach of a 
Division I volleyball program.
“It was a fast learning curve,” 
Janine said. “They had a couple fifth 
year seniors on their team so you can 
only imagine, we were like a year apart 
in age. … And so I had to try to build a 
program with kids that were basically 
the same age as I was. So it was, let me 
say, it was difficult.”
But, 
Janine 
managed. 
She 
started getting her own recruits in 
the building, and in four years, the 
program was turned around. The 
Mavericks were vying for conference 
championships and making NCAA 
tournaments, all the good signs of a 
healthy program.
Janine had succeeded yet again; 
this time, not as a player, but as a coach.
***
When Natalie, now a senior libero 
at Michigan, and her sister, Brooke, 
were little, their mom was as involved 
with volleyball as ever.
“I would grow up in the gym with 
her and a ball cart,” Natalie said. “So 
I feel like our relationship started 
around that, and our whole lives are 
kind of around volleyball.”
That sentiment wore on Janine. In 
2004, it was time for a change.
Janine announced that she would 
be resigning as the head coach of 
the University of Texas at Arlington 
volleyball program after two regular 
season titles and two tournament titles 
in 10 years, solidifying the Mavericks 
as a perennial contender in the 
Southland Conference. Instead, she 
would be taking a job at Silver Creek 
Elementary School in Azle, Texas. 
“I had an opportunity to teach at 
my children’s school,” Janine said in 
2004. “It’s in the best interest of our 
family. The goal of our family is to be 
involved in our children’s lives.”
In this new situation, Janine and 
Warren were able to do so.
As the girls grew up, volleyball 
never went away, but it wasn’t their 
mother’s game anymore, it was theirs, 
with Janine coaching them.
“Whenever we first got into really 
playing volleyball, my mom coached 
us both,” Natalie said. “Then my first 
club year, she coached us.” 
Janine, as well as Warren, coached 
the girls, but the age difference 
between Brooke and Natalie led to 

years with the two on separate teams, 
and left Janine only able to coach one 
of them. 
Natalie’s junior year of high school 
was one of her years, her parents 
coaching her club team. 
“That was a ton of fun,” Natalie 
said. “And probably my favorite year 
of my high school. … Because I think 
we got closer as a family through that.”
It was also a big recruiting year 
for Natalie, and there’s a thin line to 
pushing your own kid as a recruit. So, 
Janine and Warren waited for coaches 
to approach them about Natalie. That’s 
when they would have to disclose that 
Natalie was their daughter.
“Most coaches will tell you, ‘Oh I 
like her even more now,’” Janine said. 
“Because most Division I coaches, 
highly 
competitive 
coaches, 
like 
to have coach’s kids on their team 
because those kids understand the 
work that you need to do, and they 
understand everything that goes into 
the game of volleyball.”
Michigan coaches Mark and Leisa 
Rosen were just two of many that 
approached Janine about Natalie. 
They just happened to be the two that 
Natalie decided to play for.
“When Natalie took a visit up to 
Michigan, she just knew,” Janine said. 
“She had gone to many visits prior to 
that, and we went up to Michigan and 
we just knew that was the place for 
her.”
For Janine, that was a great fit 
for her daughter. Not only was she 
playing for Mark, a coach she knew 
and respected, but was playing for 
someone Janine met all the way back 
in high school — Leisa. 
The two played on the Junior 
National team together before starting 
their collegiate and coaching careers 
in volleyball.
“Leisa is a lot like myself,” Janine 
said. “I think that we bonded pretty 
well and I think that’s why we get 
along so well.”
But what made Janine feel best 
about her daughter’s college decision 
wasn’t about what kind of coaches the 
Rosens were or that she had played 
with one of them in high school, it was 
the kind of people they were.
“They’re unbelievable people who 
take care of their student athletes and 
really care,” Janine said.
And really, that’s what volleyball is 
for Janine — a way to express herself 
and care for others.
“She cares so much about people,” 
Natalie said. “So I think I took that 
a lot from her. Just the way she 
cares about kids and anyone she 
communicates with. It’s just very 
inspiring to see, and she’s like my 
biggest role model.
“I think that’s the thing I love 
about her the most.”
