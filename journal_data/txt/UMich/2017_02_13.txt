The LSA Bicentennial Theme 

Semester 
hosted 
its 
second 

symposium Friday in East Quad 
entitled “1877: Reconstructing 
the University of Michigan.” The 
event was a panel discussion 
Reconstruction in the aftermath 
of the Civil War in Michigan, 
including how the University’s 
modern image was shaped by the 
admittance of female students.

Michelle McClellan, associate 

history and Residential College 
professor 
explained 
how 

Reconstruction was a time of 
disarray, in which the country 
was trying to experiment with 
ways to reunite the country.

“Reconstruction is really the 

era where we would start to 
recognize the world as we know 
it,” McClellan said. “This last 
quarter of the 19th century is 
where, if we could time travel, 
we would start to recognize the 
outlines then of what we know 
now.”

According 
to 
Martin 

Hershock, professor of history 
at 
UM-Dearborn, 
Michigan 

was considered a standard of 
progression in the country with 
the creation of the Republican 
Party. 

“Michigan 
replicated 
that 

intense 
religious 
fervor 
and 

evangelical 
commitment 
to 

change,” he said. “Many referred 
to Michigan in very idealistic 

Early 
Saturday 
morning 

approximately 
30 
abortion 

opponents 
from 
throughout 

Michigan were met with an 
overwhelming number of about 
400 abortion rights advocates, 
mostly from Ann Arbor, chanting, 
“My body, my choice” along the 
sidewalks in front of west Ann 
Arbor’s Planned Parenthood.

Planned 
Parenthood 
is 
a 

nonprofit organization that offers 
reproductive health care services 
as well as testing for STIs, breast 
cancer screenings and services for 
the LGBTQ community.

The abortion opponent rally 

was initiated by the national 
organization 
Protest 
Planned 

Parenthood, 
which 
aims 
to 

defund Planned Parenthood and 
tax-funded abortions. Planned 
Parenthood 
provides 
health 

care for women and only three 
percent of their budget goes 
towards abortions. The event was 
scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. which 
concluded at about 10:30 a.m.

A 
counter-rally 
was 

organized in response by the 
local organization Stop Trump 
Ann Arbor, which seeks to 
defend the abortion services of 
Planned Parenthood. Its event 
to defend Planned Parenthood 
was scheduled to organize an 
hour earlier starting at 8 a.m. and 
lasting until about 10:30 a.m.

Jessica Prozinski, a founder 

of Stop Trump Ann Arbor, 
organized and led the abortion 

rights counter-rally over the 
course of three weeks. In a 
rebuttal to defend the services of 
Planned Parenthood, Prozinski 
said 
her 
motivations 
for 

organizing the counter-rally were 
the importance and immediate 
concern for the safety and health 
of women who have abortions.

“We will not go back to the 

days of back-alley abortions and 
coat-hanger atrocities,” Prozinski 
said. “There is no way we’re going 

back and we’re building a new 
integrative women’s movement 
to fight for women’s rights and for 
the rights of all people.”

Prozinski also shared how 

the counter-rally is just one-step 
forward in the movement for 
women’s health and how people’s 
perspectives across the country 
are changing.

“We are going to keep fighting 

from keeping the forces of reaction 
from claiming our country,” 

Prozinski said. “We’re going to 
build a new social movement to 
make our country finally equal 
and democratic.”

Ypsilanti resident Mariel de 

Soleil, a member of the local 
organization Citizens for Pro-Life 
Society, got the idea of organizing 
a local rally from the national 
movement and sought support 
through the effort through emails 
to friends and colleagues. De Soleil 

When 
Anna 
Forringer-Beal, 

a 2016 University of Michigan 
graduate of LSA, found out she 
had won a Gates Cambridge 
Scholarship to study at Cambridge 
University next year, she had to 
take a minute to digest the news.

“I was working when I found 

out, and I was on break, and I 
just left and walked around the 
block a couple times,” she said. 
“I was so excited — just so much 
energy — but I also really see it as 
a responsibility. It certainly feels 
like I’m responsible to share what 
I learn with others … so it can go 
beyond me and just my one year at 
Cambridge.”

Forringer-Beal is one of just 

36 American scholars to earn the 
scholarship this year. She and the 
rest of the American cohort will 
be joined by 54 other international 
scholars whose names have not yet 
been announced. Established in 
2000 by an endowment from Bill 
and Melinda Gates, the scholarship 
will enable her to spend a year at 
Cambridge University in England 
and earn a Master’s degree in 
multi-disciplinary gender studies.

Activists criticize institutional responses, officials express long-term optimism

In response to recent hate acts 

and a changing political climate, 
students are questioning the nature 
and progress of the University 
of Michigan’s five-year plan for 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 

Program leaders are replying by 
emphasizing long-term goals and 
voicing optimism for short-term 
strategies. 

Announced in February 2015, 

the DEI plan officially launched in 
October 2016 as a program aimed at 
fostering an inclusive and equitable 
campus climate. The five-year 
operation will cost $85 million, in 

addition to its annual investment 
of $40 million. The University-
wide plan consists of 49 sub-plans, 
each organized by a University unit 
of administration, academics or 
athletics.

Among 
the 
plan’s 
various 

initiatives are Wolverine Pathways 
and the HAIL Program, which 
aim to increase minority student 

enrollment 
and 
socioeconomic 

diversity, as well as a diversity-
related 
training 
program 
for 

faculty and staff. It also includes a 
strategy to offer financial support to

related 
research.

How to Land an 
Internship

WHAT: Internship Program 
Coordinator Kelly Day will 
provide attendees with 
information on internships and 
internship resources on campus.

WHO: Department of Psychology 

WHEN: 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.

WHERE: East Hall, Room 1866

Whether you are applying for 

your first summer job or a high-
stakes professional career, job 
interviews are often the most 
frightful part of the entire hiring 
process. 
LSA 
senior 
Krysten 

Dorfman is one of countless 
job-seekers who has felt this 

nervousness 
when 
seeking 

employment opportunities.

“You’re coming in and talking 

to someone who’s a stranger and 
you don’t know who they are, 
they don’t know who you are,” 
Dorfman said. “I feel like there’s a 
lot of pressure to present yourself 
really well, really quickly and 
really efficiently.”

For those suffering from social 

anxiety, however, job interviews 

are more than just a brief bout of 
stomach-churning nerves — they 
are excessive triggers of fear and 
self-consciousness and can often 
lead to a total avoidance of crucial 
interviews. 

Joseph Himle, professor of 

social 
work 
and 
psychology, 

researches mental health and 
social anxiety and, specifically, 
how social ability functions in 
today’s workforce and economy. 

According to a recent article 
published 
by 
University 
of 

Michigan Research, Himle’s 
research led him to a project 
in Detroit, where he helped 
unemployed 
adults 
who 

experience social anxiety both 
manage their symptoms and 
find resources for employment.

What 
Himle 
has 
found, 

however, is that the effects 
of 
social 
anxiety 
usually 

become relevant before the 
job 
interviews 
themselves, 

and remain present long after 
employment begins.

“It interferes with asking for 

job leads, certainly can interfere 
with going to an interview, or 
how you do an interview, but it 
can also cause you problems once 
you get to work,” Himle said in 
an interview with the Daily. “It 
can cause you problems when 
you talk to your supervisors 
or co-workers, and sometimes 
you don’t build relationships or 
your supervisor doesn’t know 
what you’re doing well and what 
you’re not doing so well.”

LSA senior Victoria Rai is 

a member of Alpha Kappa Psi 
professional business fraternity, 
where she assists in interviewing 
incoming 
pledge 
members 

and providing feedback on 
their interviews. When one 
of her family members, who 
experiences several symptoms 
of social anxiety, was preparing 
for an interview, Rai said she 
was able to use her experience 
from Alpha Kappa Psi as well as

More than 400 party-goers 

and volunteers danced the 

night away this Friday during 

the Night to Shine special 

needs prom at Ann Arbor’s 2|42 

Community Church. 

Sponsored by the Tim Tebow 

Foundation, an organization set 

up by the professional athlete, 

the annual event is held all 

across the world so people with 

special needs can experience the 

excitement of prom night in a 

safe, judgment-free environment. 

According to the foundation’s 

website, any person with special 

needs over the age of 14 can 

attend and are allowed to bring 

guests.

2|42 has hosted the party 

for three years at their Brighton 

location, but this was the first 

year it was also held in Ann 

Arbor.

This was Ann Arbor resident 

Kylee Claey’s first year as head 

organizer for the event, but she 

drew a large crowd by going to 

all the high schools and special 

needs centers in Ann Arbor to 

spread the word. She told MLive 

the event was all about letting 

attendees be themselves.

“Everyone just gets to do 

their own thing and it allows 

them to be themselves in just a 

royal way,” Claeys said.

The night began with 

each guest receiving the royal 

treatment — everyone was given 

a crown as they walked into 

the party through a tunnel of 

cheering volunteers. Dinner was 

served, and the guests danced for 

the rest of the time.

Last year’s head organizer, 

Julie Davis, also told MLive the 

event is important because it 

shows an often-overlooked group 

of people that they are valued in 

the community, and that there is 

a place for them.

“I think it’s a community of 

people who have a lot to offer 

who often get overlooked,” Davis 

sad. “The idea is to make them 

feel like the kings and queens 

that they are. So just let them 

have a night that’s all about them 

and not the stereotypes and 

stigma.”

terms as this sort of beacon of 
liberty. It had a terminal port in 
the Underground Railroad. It was 
the birthplace of the Republican 
Party. A number of its leading 
politicians were committed to 
reform and leading abolition.” 

John Quist, professor of history 

at 
Shippensburg 
University, 

described Michigan Republican 
voters as distrusting of former 
Confederate 
states 
and 
said 

resident 
Republicans 
did 
not 

wanting them to rejoin the Union.

“Most Michigan Republicans 

are affiliated with the party’s 
radical wing,” Quist said. “The 
Republicans 
were 
divided 

into 
moderates 
and 
radicals. 

Radicals were the ones who not 
only favored high standards for 
readmission of the former states 
of the Confederacy into the Union, 
restrictions 
on 
Confederates 

voting and holding office, but 
radicals 
also 
favored 
voting 

and citizen rights for African 
Americans.”

That year, the University also 

took steps toward gender equality 
in opting to admit women. Gayle 
Rubin, professor of anthropology 
and women’s studies, said the 
decision was met with intense 
debate, but ultimately resulted in 
women being admitted into the 
University. At this point in time, 
only four women in the world had 
doctorate degrees. 

“The 
formal 
admission 
of 

female students to Michigan took 
place in the late 19th century 
after several years of acrimonious 
debate, interrupted by the Civil 
War,” Rubin said. “So, technically, 
the admission of women took 
place 
during 
Reconstruction. 

According to the sources I’m 
using, the first female student was 
Madelon Stockwell, for whom the 
dormitory I used to walk by was 
named.”

Yet, despite its progressive 

reputation, the state also had its 
downfalls — Hershock explained 
that Michigan was the site of many 
lynchings and had a strong base for 
the white-supremacist group the 
Ku Klux Klan.

“Moreover, 
in 
spite 
of 

the 
wonderful 
and 
positive 

advancements 
that 
marked 

Michigan’s Reconstruction era, 
civil rights legacy, the state, like 
every other part of the nation, 
showed its dark underbelly in 
issues of race and equality,” 
Hershock 
said. 
“There 
were 

lynchings in Michigan, the KKK 
became a powerful force in 
Michigan in the 1920s and nearly 
elected a man for the mayor of the 
city of Detroit.” 

Yet, Hershock believes the 

University’s response to many 
recent events is evidence of some 
of the Reconstruction-era based 
initiatives.

“The 
University’s 
strong 

defense of affirmative action in the 

case of Grutter vs. Bollinger and, 
more recently, President (Mark) 
Schlissel’s bold pronouncement in 
response to the recent executive 
orders, these are just a handful 
of examples that speak to the 
University’s 
legacy,” 
Hershock 

said. 

LSA junior Emma McGlashen 

talked about how the issues the 
panel discussed are still relevant 
today. 
She 
mentioned 
that 

observing national history can 
help answer modern questions of 
equality and American identity. 

“Our country is still embroiled 

in a lot of those debates — what 
does an ‘American’ look like and 
how do they behave in relation to 
other identities?” she said. “What 
does ‘equality’ look like and how 
do we go about reaching that 
goal? I think because we’re still 
fighting those fights, it’s useful to 
look at our national history and 
the political and legal precedent 
for those arguments on a national 
scale.”

BICENTENNIAL
From Page 1A

While 
at 
the 
University, 

Forringer-Beal studied women’s 
studies 
and 
anthropology, 

completing an honors thesis with 
the assistance of Anthropology 
Assistant Prof. Jason De León 
about the migration experiences 
of undocumented women as they 
move from Central America to the 
United States.

At Cambridge, she hopes to do 

a comparative study between the 
Trafficking 
Victims 
Protection 

Act from the United States and the 
Modern Slavery Act in the U.K. This 
interest stems from her current 
work at the National Human 
Trafficking Hotline in Washington, 
D.C., as well as her undergraduate 
research and work with the Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Awareness 
Center at the University.

As 
for 
after 
Cambridge, 

Forringer-Beal already has big 
plans to use her educational 
background. She wants to pursue a 
law degree and a Ph.D. in sociology 
so she can both practice law and do 
academic work.

“I really want to be able to 

interrogate the law and how 

gender plays a part in the laws we 
construct,” Forringer-Beal said.

The Cambridge program will 

require intensive research, but 
Forringer-Beal is no stranger to 
the lab or the field. She began as 
a research assistant to De León 
as a senior in high school. Once 
she entered college, Forringer-
Beal worked as an Undergraduate 
Research Opportunity Program 
student in his lab for two years, 
then did an independent study in 
the lab as a junior. The summer 
before her senior year, she and De 
León took a trip to Mexico, where 
Forringer-Beal collected much of 
the data for her senior honors thesis 
in anthropology.

After watching her grow over 

the past five years, De León said he 
was thrilled to hear Forringer-Beal 
had won the scholarship.

“She 
was 
always 
someone 

who was very interested in doing 
research 
and 
being 
involved 

in social justice issues … and I 
think there was a time where she 
considered those things to be fairly 
separate,” he said. “Eventually, 
those worlds sort of collided, and 
I think the work she’s planning on 
doing in England is a reflection of 
that growth and the combination of 
those two interests.”

For students who might want to 

pursue a similar path to Forringer-
Beal’s, De León stresses the 
importance of research.

“Anna is a really wonderful 

example of (taking) advantage 
of all the things Michigan has to 
offer its undergraduate students,” 
De León said. “(Students should) 
get involved with independent 
research really early on. UROP is 
a great program to help students 
fine-tune their interests. I think, 
most times, students come to the 
independent research too late, and 
it’s kind of a crash course in senior 
year. But if you get involved early 
on, it’s only going to benefit you.”

Similarly, Forringer-Beal said 

her research impacted the course 
of her studies profoundly, primarily 
because it interested her so much.

“Probably one of the most 

impactful things for me was my 
thesis research,” she said.

Forringer-Beal is the eighth 

Gates 
Cambridge 
scholar 
to 

come from the University, and 
University 
students 
frequently 

win other prestigious fellowships 
and scholarships as well. However, 
most students, including Forringer-
Beal, have had to seek these 
opportunities out for themselves.

said her motivation and reasoning 
behind protesting the attempt 
at defunding the organization 
stems from what she describes as 
corruption.

“They’re criminal,” de Soleil 

said. “It’s a corrupt organization 
and 
if 
you 
Google 
‘Planned 

Parenthood crime’ you will come 
up with 550 hits. We want the 550 
million dollars plus of our taxpayer 
money to go to, to be redirected, to 
be shifted to other health clinics 
that 
do 
comprehensive 
care. 

Defund, shift the money, end of 
story.”

De Soleil commented that she, 

along with the other protesters, 

are not discouraged at all by the 
sheer number of attendees of the 
counter-rally.

“I feel energized,” de Soleil said. 

“All over the United States there 
are people standing for life and it 
doesn’t matter to me the number. 
To me we’re on the side of good and 
that is protecting human beings 
in the womb. So, yeah, I’m feeling 
good.”

De Soleil also mentioned she 

has marched with the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Sexual 
Assault 

Prevention and Awareness Center 
and has taught self-defense classes 
to college-aged women.

Students from the University 

also came out in large numbers in 
support of the abortion rights rally. 
Law students Lauren Powell and 
Rebecca Michael expressed their 

motivation for supporting the rally 
as people who have both relied 
and used the services offered by 
Planned Parenthood.

“They 
kept 
me 
safe 
and 

healthy,” Michael said. “I actually 
specifically 
used 
the 
Planned 

Parenthood in Ann Arbor both in 
high school and in undergrad, so 
I wanted to show support for the 
organization that’s been so good to 
me.”

Both students iterated the high 

number of supporters of Planned 
Parenthood 
throughout 
the 

Law School and the University 
community was encouraging. 

“I would say the majority 

of students, especially female 
students that I talk to, are in 
support of Planned Parenthood,” 
Powell said.

As a part of her keynote, 

entitled “Mindful Brilliance: The 
Deliberate, 
Courageous 
Path 

to Purpose,” Taylor described 
the foundation and creation of 
the National CARES Mentoring 
Movement

Taylor 
described 
her 

inspiration 
for 
founding 
the 

National 
CARES 
Mentoring 

Movement, and shared personal 
stories of her experiences with 
both 
that 
organization 
and 

Essence 
magazine. 
She 
also 

offered advice on becoming a 
successful individual by talking 
about what she values in life and 
how she learns the most from her 
failures, not her successes.

“(Life) is not a playground, but 

it’s a school room,” Taylor said. 
“We’re here to refine ourselves 
and I haven’t learned so much 
in my joy but in my pain, in my 

sorrow, in my losses … When I was 
wise enough to just stop and say, 
‘Ok, what do I have to learn from 
this?’ That’s where I really began 
to develop.”

Furthermore, she repeatedly 

reflected on the current nature 
of the United States education 
system and what she learned 
from her groundwork with her 
organization.

“How are we allowing a 

system to measure our children’s 
success who are living in poverty, 
who come to school hungry,” 
she said. “They’re measuring 
with the same yardstick that 
my lovely granddaughter, who’s 
now at Spellman and graduated 
from some lovely high school 
somewhere 
in 
Johns 
Creek, 

Georgia with 35 clubs that they 
could belong to, when the schools 
(CARES mentors) are working 
with don’t even have computers.”

another aspect of the program. 

“The campus-wide plan is a set 

of actions for today,” said University 
President Mark Schlissel when the 
plan launched in October. “We 
cannot live up to our full potential 
as a University unless everyone has 
an equal opportunity to contribute 
and to benefit.”

Now, several months into the 

program, students are criticizing 
the DEI plan for failing to create 
a safe environment given recent 
events.

Tuesday evening, hours after 

racist and anti-Semitic emails 
threatening Black and Jewish 
students were sent to University 
computer science and engineering 
undergraduate students, several 
students gathered for a midnight 
protest in front of the president’s 
house. Schlissel came outside to 
meet the crowd.

Citing 
incidents 
of 
racist 

flyering, 
protesters 
chanted 

“action, not emails,” referencing 
the University’s digital statement in 
response to the attacks, as opposed 
to “action” on the ground. 

Students protesters throughout 

the year have been critical of DEI 

initiatives, particularly of the 49 
individual plans. Outside Schlissel’s 
home, LSA junior Jenise Williams 
emphasized the need for collective 
action from the University. 

“We 
want 
actual 
action,” 

Williams said. “My parents were 
here 30 years ago fighting for the 
same things … and (now) I didn’t 
want my sister to come here because 
of the shit I deal with here.” 

Chief Diversity Officer Rob 

Sellers, vice provost for equity and 
inclusion, oversees the execution of 
the DEI plan. He said he lamented, 
however, that the plan cannot 
prevent individual racist attacks. 

“If DEI is held up to keeping any 

individual or groups of individuals 
from acting in these particular 
ways, and (for) that matter, if 
that’s the same expectation for 
President Schlissel, then it’s natural 
for people to feel like nothing is 
happening,” he said. “But I think 
it’s quite frankly not reasonable to 
have that expectation.”

Sellers added in a time when 

so many are concerned about the 
University in relation to a tense 
national 
political 
climate, 
he 

doesn’t want people to blame DEI 
for specific events, such as the 
emails.

“We have a whole lot of incidents 

that are sparks, and these sparks 
are being thrown on a floor that 

is full of gasoline and so these 
fires are raging,” he said. “(We) 
cannot prevent the sparks. What 
the DEI is trying to do is create an 
environment where those sparks 
do not lead to explosions and fires. 
The fact of the matter is it’s going to 
take a while before we see all of the 
changes.”

In the days following the emails 

last week, campus community 
members 
expressed 
further 

concern about the gap between 
the 
University’s 
response 
to 

inflammatory attacks and student 
needs.

Postdoctoral 
fellow 
Austin 

McCoy, who studies racial justice, 
is a graduate student instructor. 
He spent his class on Wednesday 
discussing the emails and cited the 
DEI efforts to diversify campus, 
in addition to increased student 
activism, as reasons for these 
racially-charged attacks.

In response to a statement 

from 
the 
University’s 
Office 

of Public Affairs and Internal 
Communications announcing a 
joint investigation into the emails 
between the Division of Public 
Safety and Security and the FBI, 
McCoy suggested the University 
often handles such incidents with a 
predictable routine. 

“From 
the 
administration, 

I anticipate them sending out 

probably an email and saying that 
they condemn the acts and then 
that they’re investigating, but other 
than that, I don’t know what else 
the administration plans to do,” he 
said.

Though neither Schlissel nor 

Sellers released a statement directly 
in response to the racist emails, 
LSA seniors David Schafer and 
Micah Griggs, the president and 
vice president of Central Student 
Government, 
respectively, 
sent 

a campus-wide email Thursday 
condemning the acts. Next steps 
to be taken, according to the email 
message, include tweeting out new 
developments from DPSS and the 
Office of Public Affairs, continuing 
to update media outlets and 
returning calls from parents.

In tweets to Schlissel, McCoy 

offered 
suggestions 
from 
his 

students. He said students only 
ever see what he described as 
reactionary 
DEI, 
emails 
and 

diversity statements — and it seems 
to them that someone will need 
to get hurt before Schlissel takes 
action.

Engineering 
senior 
Greg 

McMurtry, 
president 
of 
the 

University’s chapter of the National 
Society of Black Engineers, said 
administrators need to follow up 
with students who have voiced 
concerns to tell them what actions 

have been taken and ask if they are 
working.

Sellers, however, pointed to 

positive changes through DEI that 
students may not be aware of.

According to Sellers, DEI has 

allowed 
for 
the 
consolidation 

of the Division of Student Life’s 
Bias Response Team. In the past, 
faculty, staff and students had 
to look to different resources to 
receive support following a bias 
incident, but the BRT now employs 
a group of professional staff who 
respond to all targeted community 
members. In addition to helping 
victims navigate the appropriate 
long-term responses, the team aims 
to provide emotional and mental 
support.

“We’ve coordinated those efforts 

so everything comes into a central 
repository,” Sellers said. “The Bias 
Response Team is going to respond 
regardless, because it has members 
of each of those groups that are 
working together.” 

Other 
accomplishments 
of 

DEI, according to Sellers, are new 
courses for faculty to learn how 
to appropriately address campus 
climate issues in the classroom. 
These courses, created in tandem 
with University Human Resources, 
cover 
topics 
ranging 
from 

intercultural awareness to basic 
skills for fostering diversity, equity 

and inclusion.

Sellers 
said 
students 
have 

expressed concerns about faculty 
not addressing issues in their 
classes, but faculty have struggled 
with not knowing how to start the 
discussions.

“Where the DEI can be helpful is 

to provide more of that professional 
development so that we as a 
community are more resilient to 
these attacks,” he said.

According to Sellers, the goal of 

DEI is to minimize the impact, and 
not necessarily the occurrence, of 
attacks so as to enhance the security 
and educational experience of 
vulnerable students. 

“I think it is reasonable for us 

to have the expectation that we do 
everything that we can to minimize 
the impact and not allow it to 
deter us from a much larger goal 
of institutional change, opening 
up greater opportunities for more 
folks who have historically not had 
those opportunities,” he said.

Though students often object to 

the lack of community voices sought 
in the planning process, Sellers said 
one strength of DEI is that it was 
designed to be flexible and open to 
suggestions and in order to better 
serve the community.

T

hree years ago, pathetic 
and arrogant, I began 
college 
at 
Michigan 

State 
University 
with 
a 

pessimistic 
attitude 

that only ceased to 
exist at certain blood 
alcohol content levels. 
That 
clichéd 
first 

semester of college 
joy was overshadowed 
by my petty jealousy 
toward the students 
at 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan, 
an 

institution that had 
denied me. In my 
mind, the purpose of 
college was to serve as a social 
and 
economic 
class 
ladder, 

allowing individuals to ascend 
to more desirable and influential 
lives. And the University was 
everything MSU was not — 
prestigious, wealthy, elite and, 
more importantly, filled with 
students like me.

“Like 
me.” 
My 
unaware, 

18-year-old mind actually believed 
that I was more like the fictional 
upper-class 
students 
of 
the 

University, that only if I were to be 
accepted there could my roadmap 
toward an influential life begin. I 
pictured myself as an Ann Arbor 
kid trapped in East Lansing, an 
Englishman in New York.

And through a combination of 

hard work, undying pessimism 
and a disturbing level of jealousy, 
I was finally able to join those 
students with the acceptance of 
my transfer application. I, in the 
trademarked 
University 
sense, 

was finally “hoMe.” I would no 
longer feel like an outsider; I would 
finally be part of the in crowd.

Yet, 
ignorant 
and 
newly 

optimistic, I did not understand 
or 
care 
that 
the 
concept 

of 
“hoMe” 
was 
far 
more 

complicated than the fantasy 
that I had concocted in my 
imagination. I came to realize 
that MSU wasn’t so different 
from the University, that a new 
home doesn’t instantly unlock 
some hidden character within 
you and that you cannot and 
should not shed your past for the 
hopes of your imaginative future.

Esquire recently published 

an article by Dwight Garner 
on social class in America, 
centering on a question posed 
by a New Jersey family moving 
to California in the ’60s: “Where 

do people like us live?” This 
question permeates society in 
the United States. Where do 
people like us live? Where can 

we find our past lives 
in these new futures? 
The daunting and 
overwhelming 
new 

environments 
life 

takes us to require 
new understandings 
about 
ourselves 

and our hopes. We 
come 
to 
realize 

that our pasts are 
the 
only 
tangible 

evidence of who we 

actually are and that 

our expectations of new lives 
are often plagued by desires to 
replicate such pasts, whether we 
realize it or not.

Yet sometimes we even desire 

to shed our pasts completely, 
to forget everything we came 
from, no matter how positive or 
negative. We vehemently pursue 
futures that have been crafted in 
our overambitious imaginations. 
In the United States, this is 
directly related to social class. 
We like to believe that, in this 
country, if we move to a new 
place, get a new job, make new 
friends and connections, then we 
can finally become the people we 
had only once had imagined.

Yet this is simply not true. A 

social caste system exists in the 
United States, whether we see it 
or not. And though the belief that 
through admirable hard work 
and determination individuals 
can ascend to the highest levels 
of wealth and power, they never 
forget or completely lose the past 
that has shaped them. You can 
never completely drop the past 
that essentially created you.

My past has shaped who I 

am and how I act today. I come 
from a working middle-class 
town full of Polish and German 
families who work on assembly 
lines, as police officers, sales 
reps, 
electricians 
and 
other 

typical, 
dying 
middle 
class 

careers. Careers in which sizable 
chunks of income are put toward 
tuition for Catholic schools that 
are less like private East Coast 
preparatory 
academies 
and 

more reminiscent of the 1950s, 
when priests still hit kids and 
recess was held on a scorching 
blacktop parking lot. I come from 
neighborhoods where lawns are 

filled with the dumped bikes 
of kids who are climbing trees, 
harassing their younger siblings 
and beating the hell out of each 
other in tackle football.

But I was always different 

from the other kids — a little 
more mature, less interested in 
sports than in books. I had an 
exceptionality that made me 
stand out back home, that grew 
into an unchecked ego, that led 
me to believe I was better than 
other kids and to blindly imagine 
a future where my social status 
justified such arrogance.

But I finally was forced to 

ask, like the Jersey family in 
California, where do people 
like me go? The feelings that 
once convinced me I was far too 
good academically and socially 
for home or Michigan State 
had been replaced by feelings 
of inferiority and belittlement 
due to being around students 
who are smarter, richer and far 
better connected than I could 
ever hope to be. My freshman 
year fantasies of fitting right into 
place were not reality.

But like every fairy tale, I 

eventually found my place here. 
It comes through the recognition 
of 
realizing 
the 
duality 
of 

knowing where you come from 
and where you’re going. Finding 
my way in Ann Arbor was 
almost like taking off a mask 
covering up the past. I had been 
convincing myself and others 
only of someone I hoped to be, 
but never was. Embracing where 
you come from is embracing who 
you are and helps to guide you in 
the right direction, free from the 
distraction of lofty imaginations.

I’m not saying the class you 

are born into dictates your 
future; I have a little more faith 
in my country than that. But 
the overall effect is that you are 
permanently tied to who you 
were, and I believe it is necessary 
to reflect on where you come 
from to find your home in the 
future. I found my exceptionality 
in 
Ann 
Arbor. 
A 
working-

class kid with an expensive 
haircut, a young man who 
will intersperse swear words 
between multisyllabic political 
terminology in a discussion. All 
and all, never forget your roots.

I 

grew up with the smell 
of linoleum cleaner and 
Clorox wipes, with sticky 

desks and haphazard piles of 
children’s books. I grew up 
being passed along teacher 
to teacher, as my mother’s 
colleagues and friends were 
either my own teachers, second 
mothers or confidantes — I 
mixed these up frequently. 
My mother and I studied and 
worked at different schools. 
Her 
responsibilities 
as 
a 

teacher prevented her from 
caring for me and my brother 
after school, so we attended a 
different school in the district.

Outside my own classrooms, 

I spent hours upon hours 
in 
my 
mother’s 
fourth 

grade 
classroom, 
cleaning 

and 
sweeping, 
setting 
up 

and 
tearing 
down 
brightly 

colored 
infographics 
and 

multiplication charts. When I 
finally reached f ourth grade, 
I organized a pen pal program, 
connecting the students of my 
classroom with the students of 
my mother’s. I lived, ate and 
breathed school. Even when I 
thought I hated it, even when 
I had hours of homework, even 
when I came home crying, 
having failed a quiz or been 
delegated to the chorus in a 
school musical, I loved school.

My 
elementary 
school 

provided students with an 
impressive 
drama 
program, 

admired both by students and 
parents alike. In middle school, 
I was able to learn American 
Sign Language, learn to play 
an instrument in band class 
and even test out of math and 
science classes. In high school, 
I had opportunities to take a 
number of AP courses, join 
the National Honor Society 
and embrace creativity and 
problem-solving in Destination 
Imagination.

My 
opportunities 
were 

limitless 
throughout 
my 

education. My school district 
was in no way perfect and 
our nation’s public education 
system 
is 
deeply 
flawed. 

Nevertheless, I felt, and still 
feel, lucky to have had such a 
positive experience with public 
education. I am proud of my 
education. Even after coming 
to the University of Michigan 

and immersing myself with 
students 
from 
well-funded, 

sought-after public schools and 
elite private schools, I compete, 
I thrive, I succeed. All of this 
is not in spite of my public 
education, but because of it.

The confirmation of Betsy 

DeVos as the secretary of 
education is a slap in the face 
to students and alumni of 
public institutions everywhere. 
A 
woman 
who 
has 
never 

herself 
attended 
a 
public 

school and who hasn’t sent 
her own children to public 
schools is suddenly in charge 
of 
this 
nation’s 
education 

system. We have witnessed the 
prioritization of wealth exceed 
the relevance of experience, 
knowledge and intellect. The 
very ideal public education is 
built on — that if you study and 
work hard you can succeed — 
has been shattered.

DeVos 
promotes 
the 

privatization 
of 
publicly 

funded 
schooling 
through 

voucher programs and charter 
schools. 
Voucher 
programs 

allow for families to opt out 
of attending public schools 
and they promote racial and 
socioeconomic 
segregation, 

which is already perpetuated in 
the wealthy pursuit of private 
education. 
Well-meaning 

families want the best for their 
children, but moving wealthy, 
intelligent 
students 
out 
of 

public schools can be harmful 
to the growth and achievement 
of those who remain. 

Charter schools create a 

zero-sum game with public 
schools, 
such 
that 
when 

charter schools gain, public 
schools 
necessarily 
lose. 

Charter schools use the public 
funding 
allotted 
to 
each 

student to fund educations, 
which are not held up to the 
same 
standards 
as 
public 

schools. Charter schools often 
seem inviting to those who 
wish to escape impoverished 
(and often racially diverse) 
schools. This also leaves room 
for the convergence of religion 
and education, and considering 
the necessary demise of public 
schools in order to facilitate 
the success of charter schools, 
federal and national standards 
need not apply.

Teachers and the unions 

that protect their rights and 
wages are also threatened by 
the charter schools movement. 

Once again, the zero-sum game 
between charter schools and 
public schools necessitates that 
public schools lose funding when 
charter schools gain funding. 
If public schools lose enough 
students, 
and 
subsequently 

lose 
enough 
funding, 
they 

close and teachers are laid off. 
Teachers’ options are limited; 
since there are few teacher’s 
unions 
present 
in 
charter 

schools, the livelihoods and 
salaries of our educators are 
not protected in any way. 

Even more, DeVos’s voucher 

program 
is 
not 
viable 
for 

students with disabilities and 
further divides students in terms 
of race, socioeconomic status 
and intellect. When dividing 
students 
on 
these 
terms, 

we 
perpetuate 
segregation 

and deter growth. We deny 
the benefits of diversity and 
intellectual 
discussion 
from 

these 
students. 
Voucher 

programs also divide funding 
between schools, granting more 
funding to the most successful 
schools, while schools most in 
need of assistance or additional 
funding are forgotten.

K-12 education is transient but 

powerful. By the time a student 
graduates, he or she has spent 
more than 80 percent of his or 
her life in the school system. 
Public 
education 
creates 
a 

national community for students, 
one 
that 
includes 
members 

of all backgrounds, incomes, 
nationalities, races, abilities, etc. 
The diversity of public education 
cannot be undermined. Without 
diversity, 
we 
would 
lose 
a 

fundamental American attribute: 
equality of opportunity.

The public education system 

is far from perfect. It fails to 
account for segregation of all 
forms, problematic universal 
testing standards, you name 
it. But for many students like 
me, it gave me the opportunity 
to make my own choices, to 
learn about worlds beyond my 
own, to meet students diverse 
in ways beyond the standard 
measures of diversity. Every 
spelling quiz, scale jury, AP 
exam and ACT practice test 
was and will be a product of 
public education. It is not just 
our histories at stake, but our 
futures.

T

he 
University 
of 

Michigan’s 
third 

century has begun with 

a challenge. In the past days, 
acts of hate — the Islamophobic 
defilement of a site often used 
for religious reflection and the 
illicit use of email to spread 
racist and anti-Semitic slurs 
— have required us to work 
hard at remaining a University 
community.

How should we respond 

when our collective and its 
commitment 
to 
learning, 

research and the public good are 
under attack? I wish this were 
a simple question, one easy to 
answer. But at the University of 
Michigan, it is not so now, nor 
has it ever been.

This is not the first time the 

University has been shaped by 
forces that denigrate members 
of our collective and seek to 
undermine our mission. Our 
past includes stories of how 
some on campus have chosen 
homogeneity 
over 
diversity, 

inequality 
over 
equity 
and 

separation over inclusion.

The experience of Alpheus 

Tucker 
reminds 
us 
that 

we have stumbled over the 
meaning of community before. 
As Curator of Manuscripts 
Cheney Schopieray recounts 
in the forthcoming issue of the 
Clements Library’s publication, 

The Quarto, Tucker was an 
African-American 
student 

enrolled at the University’s 
medical school in 1863. When 
harassed 
by 
classmates 

because of his race, University 
faculty did not rise to Tucker’s 
defense. Nor did they rebuke 
the offending students. Instead, 
the young man was encouraged 
to leave, which he did, only 
to enroll at the University of 
Iowa, where he completed his 
studies. The cost was personal 
for Tucker. But the University 
also 
paid 
a 
price, 
trading 

its commitment to training 
excellent medical practitioners 
for racism and the exclusion of 
Black Americans.

The stakes in such moments 

are high. Just recently, Supreme 
Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
and German Justice Susanne 
Baer talked in Hill Auditorium 
about how their work as high 
court jurists grows out of a 
commitment to democracy. They 
reminded us that the University 
community also plays a role in 
sustaining democracy through 
the 
learning, 
research 
and 

public service at the core of its 
mission.

The justices did not sugarcoat 

how difficult it is to remain 
steadfast in the face of hate, 
violence and provocation. And 
neither should we. In the past 

week, our Muslim, Jewish and 
African-American 
community 

members have been among those 
on the front lines of a campaign 
that aims to intimidate students 
into leaving our community, just 
as Alpheus Tucker was more 
than 150 years ago.

We 
are 
not 
the 
first 

generation of Wolverines to 
experience how the actions 
of some can marginalize and 
exclude others. New, however, 
is how purveyors of hate also 
hope to disrupt and even destroy 
the University community writ 
large. 
Racism, 
Islamophobia 

and 
anti-Semitism 
are 
the 

weapons of people who reject 
our collective mission and aim 
to undercut our contribution to 
democracy.

In the weeks and months to 

come, we will continue to live 
and work together as students, 
staff 
and 
faculty. 
We 
will 

confront, challenge and debate 
one another as we endure the 
hate-filled season that is upon 
us. The hope for the future 
University community lies in our 
commitment to a third century 
of 
struggle 
to 
become 
the 

diverse, equitable and inclusive 
community we aspire to be.

The future University community is now

“Elle” does not gradually ease 

into perversion and graphic 
content. At the beginning of the 
film, Michele, played perfectly 
by 
Oscar-nominated 
Isabelle 

Huppert (“Amour”), is sexually 
assaulted on the floor of her 
home by a balaclava-wearing 
man. It’s first shown through the 
expressions of her cat rather than 
her own. Following the horrific 
crime, it seems natural to linger 
on the immediate effects of it, the 
viewer expects the victim to call 
the police or exert further signs 
of trauma. But “Elle” doesn’t do 
this. Rather, it lets the aftermath 
unravel through 130 minutes of 
paranoia and fear-driven action.

Michele is an owner of a 

successful video game company 
that she runs with her best friend, 
Anna (Anne Consigny, “The 
Diving Bell and the Butterfly”). 
Her son, Vincent (Jonas Bloquet, 
“3 Days to Kill”), needs her 
financial assistance after moving 
into 
a 
larger 
apartment 
to 

house his girlfriend’s newborn. 
Michele’s ex-husband, Richard 
(Charles Berling, “March of the 
Penguins”), is dating a younger 
yoga instructor, which makes her 
jealous. On top of this, Michele 
is having an affair with Anna’s 
husband, and her mom is getting 
married to a much younger 
man. Needless to say, people are 

the cause of much conflict for 
Michele.

Beyond the most villainous 

and disturbing moments of rape 
in the movie, “Elle” depicts 
numerous consensual — though 
unhealthy — sexual relationships. 
Ultimately, no relationship feels 
positive and mutually beneficial. 
However, it is Michele’s neighbor 
that causes her the most trouble. 
Patrick, played by 
Laurent 
Lafitte 

(“Asterix 
and 

Obelix: Mansion 
of 
the 
Gods”), 

is 
wealthy, 

handsome 
and 

charming. Among 
the other selfish 
characters, 
Patrick 
seems 

to be the only virtuous and 
trustworthy person for Michele.

“Elle,” at its core, is a suspense-

thriller, but in a convoluted way. 
Director Paul Verhoeven (“Black 
Book”) paces the movie slowly, 
but leads up to critical moments 
extremely effectively. At every 
moment, 
Michele 
remains 

susceptible to the rapist, even 
in her own home. He sends 
her demented texts and leaves 
perverted messages everywhere 
she goes. Clues lead up to the big 
reveal of the rapist’s identity, 
and this moment is arguably 
the movie’s strongest moment. 
Beyond the story, “Elle” is 
as much a character study 
as a thriller. Learning about 
Michele’s past family conflict 
and how she deals with being 

a woman in a male dominated 
industry is the most rewarding 
experience of the entire movie.

The movie handles the topic 

of rape with ambiguity. It’s 
not always clear as the movie 
progresses 
how 
it 
affects 

Michele, and it may seem to 
trivialize the issue. However, 
its lack of melodrama is not 
necessarily a weak point. The 

torturing 
effects 

on 
Michele 
are 

portrayed 
even 

stronger as a result 
of 
the 
movie’s 

subtler approach to 
showing emotion. 
Nevertheless, 
some of the movie’s 

many 
complex 
relationships 

add unnecessary bulk to the 
movie. And, Michele’s familial 
backstory doesn’t seem to add 
much to the plot. Huppert’s 
performance, 
however, 
is 

well deserving of an Oscar 
nomination. She is the center 
of attention throughout the 
entire film and lives up to the 
high standards set by such 
responsibility.

The graphic nature of the 

rape scenes should not be 
taken lightly. Certainly, it’s 
pushing the boundaries of what 
can be displayed in a major 
motion 
picture. 
Considering 

that women’s stories of sexual 
assault have been covered up 
and marginalized over time, it’s 
necessary that victims’ voices 
be heard.

Huppert delivers strong 
performance in ‘Elle’

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

Professor Natalie Bakopoulos and novelist Katie Kitamura 
preview Kitamura’s new novel at popular local bookstore

Katie 
Kitamura’s 
writing 

style 
is 
inimitably 
different 

from the majority of modern 
American 
literature 
stocking 

national bookstore shelves. An 
American novelist, art critic and 
journalist, Katie Kitamura earned 
her PhD in American literature 
from the London Consortium 
after graduating from Princeton 
University in 1999. She has written 
both nonfiction and fiction pieces 
of literature, in addition to writing 
articles for The Guardian, The New 
York Times and Wired. Monday 
night, Kitamura will converse 
about her new novel “A Separation” 
with 
Natalie 
Bakopoulos, 
an 

author and professor of Modern 
Greek, who is a graduate of the 
MFA program at Michigan.

Kitamura’s novel, which was 

published earlier this month, has 
already been widely read and 
acclaimed.

“The novel is about a woman 

who is only recently separated 
from her husband when she is 
told that he is missing,” Kitamura 
said. “She travels to a remote part 
of Greece to look for him, and 

the story unspools from there. 
The landscape in the southern 
Peloponnese was in a lot of ways 
the origin of the book — I was 
looking for a character, and a 
narrative voice, that would reflect 
that landscape.”

Due 
to 
the 

intriguing 
plot 

of 
her 
story, 

the 
book 
has 

gained 
enough 

recognition 
to 
be 
turned 

into 
a 
movie. 

Kitamura’s 
book 
will 
be 

adapted later this 
year, 
starring 

Katherine 
Waterston.

The novel is 

mesmerizing and follows a story 
that is not commonly depicted in 
literature and film. She explores 
the themes of divorce and the 
disintegration of relationships in 
a unique setting. Kitamura’s prose 
has been described as “somewhat 
hypnotic” 
by 
various 
book 

reviewers on a variety of online 
blogs and as a must-read for lovers 
of all genres.

Kitamura is an established and 

knowledgeable author, and has 
already written one nonfiction 

book and three fiction novels.

“Fiction is really where my heart 

is — I find that it’s easier for me to 
be direct in fiction,” Kitamura said 
when asked about her preference 
between 
the 
two 
genres. 

“Nonfiction tends to make me more 

self-conscious, which 
is never useful for a 
writer.”

Kitamura has also 

dabbled in journalism 
throughout 
her 

career, 
and 
she 

believes it beneficial 
to be exposed to other 
artists’ work.

“I only have one 

piece of advice, which 
is to read as much as 
possible,” 
Kitamura 

said. “I don’t know a 

single good writer who is not also a 
good reader.”

Both Bakopoulos and Kitamura 

emphasize the importance of being 
both a writer and a reader.

“Art takes time. It cannot 

be rushed,” Bakopoulos said, 
mirroring Kitamura’s words. “You 
have to commit, and you have to 
commit fully. Try to experience as 
much art as you can. If you want 
to be a writer, read. And read. And 
read. Otherwise you won’t be any 
good.”

BRAVO

Brian Benben as Max in “Imposters”
‘Imposters’ impresses 
with intriguing premise

For 
a 
series 
premiere, 

“Imposters” is impressively self-
aware. A new venture from Bravo 
into the intersection of love and 
the art of the con, “Imposters” 
strikes 
an 
effective 
balance 

between comedy and drama. The 
show approaches its somewhat 
unrealistic 
premise 
with 
a 

heavy dose of juvenile humor 
that is both well-executed and 
enjoyable. While not the most 
deftly produced program, and 
one without any semblance of star 
power among its cast, “Imposters” 
entertains with its snappy dialogue 
and compelling tale that indicates 
gratifying vengeance lies on the 
horizon for both its characters and 
its audience.

In “Imposters,” Inbar Lavi 

(“Gang Related”) stars as Maddie, 
a master con with a flair for the 
dramatic who relishes in her 
ruthlessness. Along with her 
cunning partners Max (Brian 
Benben, 
“Dream 
On”) 
and 

Sally (Katherine LaNasa, “The 
Campaign”), the trio infiltrate the 
lives of single, wealthy individuals 
and seduce them. After winning 
their affection, they’ll take their 
subjects for all they have — they’ll 
empty their bank accounts and 
max out their credit cards. These 
victims learn their fate quickly and 
mercilessly, and the series begins 
just as Maddie’s latest victim, 
Ezra (Rob Heaps, “Home Fires”), 
accepts the fact that he’s been 
played. It’s not the most plausible 
premise, especially when the show 

gets into the exact details of each 
con, but there aren’t enough holes 
in it to sink the series.

“Imposters” brings a nice twist 

to the traditional con storyline: real 
emotional investment. Maddie’s 
targets aren’t just abandoned to 
be broke and indebted — they’re 
emotionally devastated, having 
lost their longtime girlfriend, or 
even wspouse, in some instances. 
It’s a wholly novel take that gives 
the story weight and inspires 
more brutal, calculating revenge 
from these victims. Maddie may 
be 
confident 
in 

her 
belief 
that 

her victims “will 
never 
see 
[her] 

again,” but this 
unique brand of 
motivation 
will 

evidently put her 
future schemes to 
the test.

To complement its emotionally-

charged storylines, the series relies 
on an effective blend of crude and 
self-deprecating humor. Led by 
Ezra, Maddie’s past targets take 
time to roast themselves for their 
current state and for ignoring 
the initial signs of her con. In a 
particularly funny scene, as Ezra 
sympathizes with another of 
Maddie’s past spouses, Bobby 
(Andrew Jenkins, “Lost Solace”), 
he asks if he, too, drowned his 
sorrows with “booze and a lot of 
crying.” To Ezra’s chagrin, Bobby 
simply responds, “No,” before 
going on to explain that he’s 
coped without frequent sobbing. 
There’s nothing earth-shattering 
about these scenes, but the jokes 
are conveyed precisely and work 

well at giving the show a lighter 
tone.

With its quality writing, it 

is 
rather 
disappointing 
that 

“Imposters” does not boast a 
stronger or more diverse cast. 
Outside of Lavi’s strong lead 
performance, many of the show’s 
actors bring little experience, and 
it shows from the opening minutes. 
Although they both handle the 
comedic duties of their parts well, 
Heaps and Jenkins consistently 
fail to bring emotional depth to 
their roles. Their overall response 

to 
Maddie’s 

con 
is 
both 

underwhelming 
and unconvincing, 
leading viewers to 
question whether 
they’re 
truly 
as 

upset about losing 
their spouses as 
they claim to be. 

Similarly, Benben and LaNasa 
neglect to bring anything lasting 
to the screen, even though their 
roles as Maddie’s partners would 
seem to afford them an excellent 
opportunity to develop intriguing 
and 
complex 
characters. 

Having such an anonymous and 
replaceable cast is one of the 
series’s biggest flaws, and it may 
ultimately hinder “Imposters” 
from gaining serious momentum.

At a time when television 

appears to consistently churn out 
underdone pilots and half-baked 
test-runs, “Imposters” breaks the 
mold. Well-crafted and intriguing 
throughout its premiere, the 
series has the potential for real, 
sustained success — if its cast can 
get its act together.

The path forward for ‘Jane the Virgin’

Exploring the future of romantic comedy in the wake of loss and mixed emotions

Character deaths on TV rarely 

get to me. Even on my favorite 
shows, the most heartbreaking 
deaths usually make me sad for 
a moment — and then, when the 
episode is over, I move on and think 
about something else. A lot of the 
time, too, killing off a particular 
character makes so much sense for 
the story that my appreciation of its 
narrative efficiency far offsets my 
emotional reaction to it. But man, 
when Jane Villanueva’s husband 
died on the last episode of “Jane 
the Virgin,” I was a wreck. I was so 
in shock that I didn’t actually cry; I 
know that the real tears will come 
in the next few episodes, when I’ve 
accepted that Michael Cordero 
is dead, and that he’s not coming 
back. As the final five minutes of 
the episode passed, I sat in bed 
with my hands pressed tightly over 

my cheeks, thinking: “No, this isn’t 
real. This is a fantasy. Jane’s about 
to wake up and Michael will be 
lying next to her and it will all be 
OK.” But then Jane picked up the 
phone and I heard the word “died,” 
and then the show skipped three 
years into the future, and I knew it 
was real.

This is the kind of character 

death that hit me hard enough to 
briefly disable my critical faculties. 
I didn’t know if this was good for 
the show or not, and I didn’t really 
care. I was just sad. I felt that 
core sadness that you feel when 
anything bad happens: a breakup 
or a death in the family or any kind 
of random tragedy; I wish this 
thing didn’t happen.

After a while, I was able to 

think about it logically. The third 
season of “Jane the Virgin” has 
been a little unexciting. It’s not 
necessarily a step down in quality, 
but I’ve gotten used to the elements 
that previously seemed so novel 

when the show first premiered. It’s 
a reliably entertaining show, but no 
longer a truly thrilling, surprising 
one.

But there were ways to deal with 

that stagnation without killing off 
Michael. Part of me wishes the 
three-year time jump happened 
without Michael’s death — we 
could skip forward to a point when 
Michael was done with law school, 
when Rafael was out of jail, and 
we’d still have the mystery of the 
wedding to look forward to. For 
me, Jane’s marriage to Michael 
wasn’t a factor in the staleness of 
the third season.

In fact, back when Michael got 

shot in the second season finale, 
I had a long time to think about 
the possibility of him dying, and 
I ultimately decided it was better 
for the show to keep him alive. 
To kill off the love of Jane’s life, 
especially on the day of their 
wedding, right before Jane was 
going to lose her “virgin” moniker, 

seemed excessively cruel. It would 
shroud the series in darkness, and 
honestly, I don’t watch “Jane the 
Virgin” for its tragic twists and 
misery porn. I watch it to feel 
happy and hopeful.

Besides, 
in 
a 
TV 
world 

populated 
with 
decaying 

marriages, 
marriages 
fraught 

with infidelity, lies, manipulation 
and miscommunication, Jane and 
Michael were a shining light. They 
were a couple who occasionally 
fought, but who always worked 
through their disagreements by 
speaking openly and honestly to 
each other, learning from their past 
mistakes and striving to become 
better people. There aren’t a lot of 
couples like that on TV. Sure, maybe 
it’s “unrealistic” to have a husband 
as perfect as Michael, someone 
who’s so endlessly accommodating 
and understanding, but is there 
anything wrong with indulging 
in fantasies once in a while 
(especially in a telenovela)? Isn’t it 

OK to depict the gold standard of a 
healthy relationship, to give us all 
something to strive for in our own?

The third season of “Jane the 

Virgin,” while it might’ve betrayed 
the show’s first signs of age, should 
be commended for keeping the 
Jane/Michael relationship fresh, 
interesting 
and 
swoon-worthy. 

Part of me still believes the 
greatest sign of the show’s strength 
would be to marry off its main 
character in the second season and 
keep the couple together for the 
entirety of the show — five, or six 
or seven seasons — while staying 
unpredictable 
and 
interesting. 

If anyone could do it, it’d be the 
writers of “Jane the Virgin.”

And yet, after having some time 

to mull it over, to move past my 
initial soul-crushing sadness and 
think about what the show will be 
going forward, I’m optimistic. It 
might’ve been bold to keep Jane 
and Michael together forever, but 
what the show chose to do instead 

is undeniably gutsy. Rather than 
settling for a simple happy ending 
(which, of course, has its time 
and place, and this show seems 
like a worthy candidate), “Jane 
the Virgin” is going to become 
a series about moving on from 
tragedy, about how happy endings 
can still be possible in the wake of 
unimaginable grief.

The next few episodes of the 

show will really be a test. Maybe 
it’ll become clear the show is 
running on fumes, that this move 
was a gimmicky stab at retaining 
interest by killing off a main 
character and teasing a wedding 
with a dramatic time jump. Or 
maybe the show will prove that it’s 
a more thoughtful show than most 
people ever gave it credit for, that it 
can keep its joyful, optimistic tone 
intact despite the unspeakable 
loss the main character has 
experienced. Knowing “Jane the 
Virgin,” I think I know which one 
it’s going to be.

A big one in Bloomington

I

f the Michigan men’s 
basketball team is still 
looking for its identity 

after that, it’s looking too hard.

On Sunday, the Wolverines 

had their most important win of 
their recent 
resurgence, 
an odd thing 
to say days 
after they 
rolled their 
in-state rival 
by 29. But 
the reason 
Michigan’s 
75-63 win 
over Indiana 
was so 
impressive was about more 
than Derrick Walton Jr.’s 
continued scoring tear or D.J. 
Wilson’s defensive dominance 
— though both were critical. 
It’s about time and place. It’s 
about context. It’s about all the 
ways the game could have gone 
wrong and didn’t — because the 
Wolverines wouldn’t let it.

In every moment you thought 

they’d finally cave, they only 
got tougher. Their senior 
point guard looked like an All-
American. Their defense took 
balls away near the basket. And 
they did all this at Assembly 
Hall, a place in which they 
hadn’t won since 2009.

It was all enough to ask, 

“Who are we talking about 
here?”

For the first time in a long 

time, the answer was the 
Michigan men’s basketball 
team.

Coming off a blowout 

win in a rivalry that has 
been torturous of late, the 
Wolverines somehow delivered 
a more impressive win in the 
follow up. Michigan may not 
have actually played any better 
than it did when it dispatched 
the Spartans on Thursday, but 
when you take rivalry out of 

the equation, Sunday’s victory 
could go a lot farther.

First, and most importantly, 

the Wolverines got an all-
important road win. And, again, 
the context mattered. Entering 
Sunday’s matchup, Michigan 

was 0-6 on the road yet 
probably needed to win three 
of its final five road games to 
have good shot at the NCAA 
Tournament. With a loss to the 
Hoosiers, those odds would 
have decreased in a hurry. The 
fact that the Wolverines won 
on the road is what pushes 
the Indiana win ahead in the 
importance standings. It’s 
one thing to win when your 
home crowd is behind you, 
but another entirely to do it in 
hostile confines.

Second, Michigan received 

its contributions from the right 
places — even with one of the 
most important contributors 
notably absent. Walton notched 
his fifth straight game with 

20 or more points. Wilson 
scored 13 points on 6-of-11 
shooting, plus three blocks 
and three steals, including 
one stretch where he stole two 
passes and blocked a shot on 
three consecutive possessions. 
Sophomore center Moritz 
Wagner tallied a double-double 
and redshirt junior wing 
Duncan Robinson added eight 
points off the bench.

And they did all of this 

without much of anything from 
senior wing Zak Irvin, who, 
presumably, can’t stay this cold 
forever. It’s hard to understate 
how impressive Michigan has 
been this week while getting 
little to nothing from Irvin, 
arguably the team’s most 

important scorer.

In fact, Irvin may be the only 

key piece of the team’s puzzle 

that’s not in alignment right 
now. And if you assume he will 
eventually find some semblance 
of the player he was earlier this 

season, that bodes extremely 
well for the Wolverines if 
they can maintain this level of 
energy.

That energy, along with 

the staggering breakout of 
Walton, seems to be the key 
in accounting for this recent 
run. It was best seen Sunday 
through the team’s offensive 
rebounding effort, including 
three by Wagner, but it was also 
evident from Wilson’s extendo-
arms on defense and the way 
Indiana’s runs didn’t prove 
catastrophic.

Energy would at least 

partially explain why Michigan 
won the game with relative 
security, even while shooting 
markedly worse (by 13 percent 
from the floor and 11 percent 
on 3-pointers) than they 
did against the Spartans on 
Tuesday.

Perhaps most important is 

not what this energy caused, but 
what it could be a sign of: hope.

The Wolverines have now 

won four of their last six. They 
have done two things — blowing 
out Michigan State and winning 
at Indiana — that no one on the 
team had done previously. They 
are peaking just in time to get 
maximum exposure for their 
resume-building wins.

With No. 7 Wisconsin set to 

visit Ann Arbor on Thursday, 
Michigan has an opportunity 
for an NCAA Tournament 
resume headliner this week. 
And if the Wolverines do indeed 
end up punching their ticket to 
the tournament, they can look 
back on Sunday as the day they 
fortified the three things you 
can’t make it through March 
without: A resume, an identity, 
and hope.

CLAIRE MEINGAST/Daily

Redshirt sophomore forward DJ Wilson and his fellow Wolverines finally won on the road, and in many ways, it felt more important than a win over an in-state rival.

‘M’ peaking heading into Big Tens

With merely a couple of 

weeks to go before the Big Ten 
Championships for the men’s and 
women’s track and field teams, 
both Michigan squads know the 
most important competitions of 
their seasons are still in front of 
them. 

But from their performances 

at both the SPIRE D1 Invitational 
and the Iowa State Classic, 
both teams can glean one major 
takeaway from their weekend 
meets: they’re peaking at the 
right time.

“That is what our goal is, 

to peak toward the Big Ten 
(Championships),” said Michigan 
women’s track and field coach 
James 
Henry. 
“And 
we’re 

improving … you can’t ask for 
more than that.”

Spearheaded by the continued 

dominance of senior distance 
runner Erin Finn and freshman 
phenom sprinter Jade Harrison, 
the 
tenth-ranked 
Wolverines 

capped 
off 
their 
final 
full 

weekend before the Big Ten 
Championships in style, with 11 
athletes improving their personal 
records on Saturday alone.

Harrison headlined the group’s 

notable ascension, posting times 
that 
nearly 
broke 
Michigan 

records. On Friday, her time of 
24.23 in the 200-meter dash 
came within a quarter of a second 
of breaking the school record. On 
Saturday, her time of 54.12 in the 
400-meter dash gave her fourth 
place overall and was just half a 
second off the program best. 

Though those records will 

likely 
be 
shattered 
before 

Harrison leaves Michigan, Henry 
insists that records are not her 
focus.

“She’s like the team. She’s 

improving, she’s a good athlete,” 
Henry said. “She’s not chasing 
records, she just wants to get 
better.”

Finn posted a nation-leading 

time of 15:34.36 in the 5,000-
meter race Saturday. The time 
was also good for the SPIRE 
facility record, breaking Finn’s 
own mark of 15:37.31 that won 
her the Big Ten title last season. 
With Finn and the rest of the 

Wolverines returning for the Big 
Ten Championships in two weeks, 
the senior will undoubtedly be 
looking to best that mark once 
more.

Dual-sport 
athlete 
Claire 

Kieffer-Wright 
took 
home 

Michigan’s only individual win 
on Saturday, emerging victorious 
in the high-jump. Her season-
best jump of 1.78 meters came just 
two centimeters shy of her career 
best.

For Henry, getting Kieffer-

Wright — also a member of the 
volleyball team — into high-
jumping shape has presented a 
challenge, though Kieffer-Wright 
has been up to the task.

“That’s probably one of the 

hardest things that I have to do 
as a coach,” Henry said. “She 
wants to be a two-sport athlete 
and 
she’s 
working 
in 
both 

sports simultaneously. I’m very 
impressed with her work ethic 
and patience to get better.”

For the men, another dual-

sport athlete bested his own 
personal record. Junior Drake 
Johnson finished as the runner-

up in the 60-meter hurdles, 
earning a career-best time of 7.93 
seconds at the SPIRE Invitational.

In the shot put, senior Grant 

Cartwright also finished second. 
Cartwright currently sits on the 
outside looking in at the NCAA 
Championship picture; he ranks 
18th nationally, with just the 
top 16 athletes advancing to the 
finals. 

According to Michigan coach 

Jerry Clayton, “It’ll take right at 
his personal best” for Cartwright 
to sneak into the top-16.

The 
Wolverines, 
though, 

recognize that the results in two 
weeks at the same location will 
matter more. This tune-up gave 
Clayton an opportunity to send a 
younger group to SPIRE and allow 
them to get their feet wet in the 
same location. After all, it will be 
that same setting that determines 
their ultimate Big Ten fate.

“I thought overall we had a 

lot of consistency from event to 
event,” Clayton said. “I think now 
we just need to refocus and get set 
on the championship and go there 
with a positive attitude.”

Michigan opens season 3-2 at USF Wilson-Demarini Tournament

Seventeen innings played in 

a nine-hour span. Almost 300 
pitches thrown. But in the end, the 
effort just left the Wolverines with 
two tallies in the loss column for 
the day.

Saturday was tough to swallow 

for the No. 6 Michigan softball 
team.

After winning their first two 

games at the USF Wilson-Demarini 
Tournament in Tampa, Fla., on 
Friday 
against 
Delaware 
and 

Illinois State, the Wolverines (3-2) 
dropped two straight Saturday. 
The first was a 2-1 defeat in 10 
innings against No. 4 Florida, while 
the second was a 6-4 rout to No. 25 
South Florida. A commanding 12-2 
run-rule, bounce-back victory over 
St. John’s salvaged the weekend 
— marking the third win in five 
contests.

For 
Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins, the losses are simply a 
sign of a young team still trying to 
develop their identity.

“I’m really not caught up 

in outcomes at this point in 
the year and I told a few of the 
upperclassmen, if you look at all the 
games, we were this close to being 
5-0,” Hutchins said. “Both those 
games (Saturday) were ours to 
take, and we didn’t take them. But 
we were in them. And I said, if we 
were 5-0, I would feel exactly the 
same way I feel right now, which is 
that we have some growing to do as 
a team, and it starts to do with our 
trust and belief in ourselves and 
our trust and belief in our team.”

Against Florida — a familiar 

foe that’s had Michigan’s number 
for the past three years — the 
Wolverines fell in heartbreaking 
fashion in a game that can be 
marked down as another classic in 
the intense series.

A chess match from the outset, it 

was a pitcher’s duel at its finest. In 
one of her top career performances, 
senior right-hander Megan Betsa 
tossed 190 pitches, recorded 12 
strikeouts, left 14 baserunners 
stranded and yielded just six hits 

in 10 innings pitched. Runs in 
the top and bottom of the fourth 
inning proved to be all the offenses 
could muster against both Betsa 
and Gator ace Kelly Barnhill. After 
seven innings, the game remained 
deadlocked at one.

In 
the 
extra 
stanzas, 
the 

momentum seemed to shift in 
Michigan’s 
favor. 
Back-to-back 

plays at the plate in the eighth 
thwarted Florida’s opportunities 
and preserved a 1-1 tie. With 
runners on second and third 
with one out, a fielder’s choice 
caught the runner at home off a 
throw from senior shortstop Abby 
Ramirez. A wild pitch during the 
ensuing at-bat led to sophomore 
catcher Alex Sobczak tracking the 
ball down and throwing it to Betsa 
for the tag.

But the Wolverine hurler failed 

to receive enough run support 
needed to squeeze out a victory. 
Even senior center fielder Kelly 
Christner’s 4-for-4 day at the plate 
wasn’t enough to crack the code. 
Playing under the international 
tiebreaker rules — each team 
begins extra innings with a runner 
on second base — Michigan 
stranded a runner on third in the 
eighth, ninth and 10th innings. 
The Gators finally got the best of 
Betsa with two outs in the tenth, a 
blooper to center field that scored 
the winning run.

Hutchins decided to let Betsa 

go the distance against Florida 
because, even after a slow start, 
the Wolverine ace found her stride 
and began to find the answer to the 
potent Gator lineup.

“She got better as the Florida 

game went on because she started 
competing and going after them 
and she started really attacking 
them,” Hutchins said. “It’s a really 
tough game to lose when the 
winning run was given to them 
by the (international tiebreaker) 
rule. But it’s the name of the game 
and we had our opportunities. We 
were the home team and … did not 
score.”

Christner’s offensive explosion 

against Florida was only part of 
her successful weekend. The senior 

captain led Michigan in batting 
average (.533) and hits (eight), 
including three doubles. Hutchins 
believes that after a slow start in 
the first two games, Christner rose 
to the occasion as both a force on 
and off the field.

“Friday, she wasn’t on her game 

and I was just really pleased with 
her turning it around on Saturday,” 
Hutchins said. “She really had 
both games, big performances, 
she stepped up, both physically, 
but really her mindset was, ‘We’re 
going after this guys.’ She really did 
everything she could to pick the 
team up and put them on her back.”

Following the narrow loss to the 

Gators, the Wolverines couldn’t 
recover against host South Florida 
in 
Saturday’s 
nightcap. 
After 

jumping to an early 3-0 lead that 
included a double from Ramirez 
and an RBI single from junior 
right-hander Tera Blanco, the Bulls 
outscored Michigan 6-1 the rest of 
the way, hitting a two-run inside-
the-park home run in the third 
and scoring four more times in the 
sixth. In the top of the seventh, the 
Wolverines loaded the bases with 
one out, but a game-ending double 
play halted the comeback attempt.

Despite Saturday’s rough patch, 

Michigan found promise in its three 
season-opening tournament wins, 
including 
dominant 
showings 

Friday — 7-0 over Delaware and 
4-2 over Illinois State.

The Wolverines’ sophomores led 

them offensively, with left fielder 
Courtney 
Richardson, 
second 

baseman Faith Canfield, right 
fielder Natalie Peters and Sobczak 
accounting for 12 of 19 hits and 
eight of 10 RBI on opening day.

The trio of Richardson, Canfield 

and Peters tallied consecutive 
hits in both the second and sixth 
against Delaware, igniting the 
Wolverines’ offense and widening 
the margin over the Blue Hens. 
Peters’ second-inning double, one 
of her three hits in the game, gave 
Michigan an early 1-0 lead, one 
it would never surrender. Hours 
later, Richardson — who went 
3-for-4 against Delaware on Friday 
— launched a three-run home run 

against the Redbirds, which was 
ultimately the difference-maker in 
the contest.

Betsa fanned 15 Blue Hens in her 

final opening day as a Wolverine 
and Blanco added eight of her own 
against Illinois State, both pitchers 
throwing complete games. Betsa 
easily stifled Delaware rallies in 
the fourth, fifth and sixth innings, 
relinquishing a meager three hits 
and never allowing a runner past 
second base. Blanco tried to match 
her 
teammate, 
retiring 
seven 

straight batters after allowing a 
three-run Redbird home run.

Blanco again got the nod Sunday 

morning against St. John’s and 
received ample help from her 
offense from the first pitch of 
the game. The top of the lineup, 
featuring Peters, Canfield and 
Christner, contributed seven of 14 
hits and five of 12 RBI. Christner 
added 
onto 
her 
successful 

weekend, going 3-for-4 with two 
RBI and two runs scored. Peters 
— who Hutchins deemed one of 
the “steadiest performers” from 
the weekend — continued her solid 
debut in her starting lead-off role, 

going 2-for-3 with a run and one 
RBI, while also showcasing strong 
defensive play in the outfield. After 
just five innings played, Michigan 
won 12-2 via the run-rule. 

Coming into Sunday and turning 

out such a dominant performance 
was evidence of a Wolverine team 
that faces adversity with apparent 
ease.

“I think (Saturday) obviously 

was a very hard day, two pretty 
tight losses, long games, got to 
sleep late and had to wake up 
early, but I think we came out 
(Sunday) and we all had a lot of 
energy and wanted to help out the 
pitchers,” Christner said. “And 
just the fact that we were able to 
score runs every inning and help 
our pitchers out just showed that 
after any loss, we’re stronger than 
before.”

Right-hander 
Leah 
Crockett 

earned her first pitching prospect 
of the season against the Red 
Storm, relieving Blanco after three 
innings to finish the rest of game. 
The sophomore gave up two runs 
over two innings but successfully 
pitched out of a jam in the fourth, 

leaving runners on first and third.

Even with tough defeats at 

the hands of ranked opponents, 
Hutchins and her team are looking 
to move past the losses and focus 
on improving certain technical 
skills on both offense and defense 
before next weekend’s ACC/Big 
Ten Challenge in Raleigh, N.C.

“It starts to do with our trust 

and belief in ourselves and our 
trust and belief in our team,” 
Hutchins said. “… We have to do a 
better job of uniting as a group in 
our mindset, and our mindset has 
to be what our process statements 
are, which are one pitch and trust, 
trust your pitch, trust your process. 
We’re not very good at that yet and 
we’ve got some mechanical things 
as well that we will continue to 
work at and I expect we’ll get a lot 
better.”

Saturday was tough to swallow 

for the sixth-ranked Wolverines. 
But learning from mistakes from 
the opening weekend will be 
crucial for a young team looking to 
assert its long-standing identity as 
one of the most elite teams in the 
nation.

ZOEY HOLMSTROM/Daily

The Michigan hockey team stood on the ice as Mike Ilitch was honored at the “Duel in the D” at Joe Louis Arena on Friday.

Wolverines and Spartans 
unite to honor Mike Ilitch

DETROIT — On Friday night, 

thousands of people in Joe 
Louis Arena anxiously awaited 
the puck drop for the “Duel in 
the D,” between the Michigan 
hockey team and its bitter rivals, 
Michigan State.

The announcer introduced 

the players to a chorus of rousing 
cheers and boos as minutes 
remained before the opening 
faceoff in the storied hockey rink 
set up to be replaced by Little 
Caesars Arena.

Before the Spartan band began 

to play the national anthem, 
though, the announcer urged for 
a moment of silence.

Just hours before this special 

game, Detroit Red Wings owner 
Mike Ilitch passed away. The 
crowd of 17,720 stood in awe as 
they memorialized the Motor 
City icon.

For a few moments, both 

Wolverine and Spartan fans 
stood 
united 
together 
to 

commemorate a true hero. While 
minutes later the game would 
begin and aggressive checking 
and fighting would ensue, there 

was a sense of mutual respect. 
Members of both Michigan and 
Michigan State — especially 
those from the Great Lakes State 
— had a personal connection to 
the late Red Wings owner.

“It’s really sad,” said senior 

forward Max Shuart. “I honestly 
couldn’t believe it when I heard 
it. It seems like that guy’s 
timeless. He’s been around so 
long and I’m sure there’s a lot 
of heavy hearts in the Detroit 
community especially among the 
hockey players.”

According to Michigan State 

goaltender John Lethemon, he 
and his teammates expressed 
similar feelings of shock. Few 
of them even knew he was in 
the hospital, and because they 
found out just before the game, 
the Spartans quickly needed to 
refocus.

In a game that carried extra 

meaning 
for 
Lethemon 
and 

fellow Northville native Shuart, 
the latter saw an opportunity 
to honor the late Red Wings’ 
owner. The senior scored his 
second goal of the season Friday 
night, helping contribute to an 
eventual shootout victory for the 
Wolverines.

While the players reflected 

on time spent watching the 
Red Wings growing up, both 
Michigan 
State 
coach 
Tom 

Anastos and Michigan coach Red 
Berenson reflected on Ilitch’s 
work in growing the sport of 
college hockey.

They credited both his passion 

for the game and his support 
of 
the 
Wolverines 
and 
the 

Spartans. Berenson explained 
that Ilitch nearly singlehandedly 
spearheaded the annual “Duel in 
the D,” as well as the yearly Great 
Lakes Invitational competitions.

“(He supported it) whether it 

drew well or not,” Berenson said. 
“It wasn’t a moneymaker, it was 
doing the right thing for college 
hockey. Mike Ilitch and (his 
wife) Marian were so good for 
college hockey and Detroit.”

Added Anastos: “He’s been a 

huge advocate of the sport at all 

levels, whether it’s the NHL or 
youth hockey. He’s certainly a big 
advocate of college hockey. and 
one of the reasons we’ve been 
able to elevate college hockey to 
the profile it has today.”

For 
Berenson, 
though, 
it 

wasn’t an experience he had at 
Michigan that stood out to him 
the most about Ilitch, rather, he 
recalls moments spent with the 
owner and his family when he 
sought a coaching position for 
the Red Wings.

“I interviewed for the Red 

Wings job years ago,” Berenson 
said. “When I was cut from the 
St. Louis Blues, I spent the day 
with Ilitch and his family. What 
a first class group they were, and 
we always had a friendship after 
that. He had family that went to 
Michigan so he had some ties at 
Michigan, and he would call me 
from time to time and talk about 
hockey or talk about Michigan.”

Like Berenson, Anastos shared 

his own experiences with Ilitch. 
Despite Ilitch’s connections with 
Michigan— his daughter Denise 
has served as a Regent for the 
University since 2008— he found 
opportunities to connect with 
Michigan State as well.

“When I was with the Central 

Collegiate Hockey Association 
(with 
Michigan 
State), 
we 

worked with the Ilitch family 
and I got to know Mr. Ilitch,” 
Anastos said. “… He invested 
his passion for the game. He 
loved the game, he loved his 
players, he loved his city and 
that was infectious toward 
anybody who was around him. 
I was very much moved by how 
passionate he was about all 
those things.”

Friday night served as the last 

time the two teams will play in 
Joe Louis Arena. And it is likely 
that this weekend will be the 
last game between the two this 
season.

There are few better ways to 

honor Ilitch than playing in “the 
Joe.”

According to Shuart at least, 

“It’s the house that Mike built.”

Michigan thrashed by Spartans

On Friday night, the Michigan 

hockey 
team 
returned 
from 

Detroit after winning in its final 
“Duel in the D” battle at Joe Louis 
Arena. A 4-4 tie with Michigan 
State 
had 

forced the 
game into 
a shootout, 
and 
junior 
defenseman 
Sam 

Piazza’s goal allowed the team to 
take home the Iron D trophy.

Saturday’s game didn’t turn 

out as well.

The Wolverines (2-8-2-2 Big 

Ten, 9-14-3 overall) fell to the 
Spartans, 4-1. The stark contrast 
between the weekend’s games 
proved to be enough for Michigan 
State (2-8-2-0, 6-17-3) to salvage a 
split in the series.

In the beginning, a Michigan 

win didn’t seem unattainable. 
Freshman 
goaltender 
Jack 

LaFontaine faced 14 shots from 
the Spartans throughout the first 
period, and even when it looked 
guaranteed that the puck would 
go in, it didn’t.

When Michigan State forward 

Mason Appleton brought the 
puck close on a breakaway, 
LaFontaine knocked it away. 
When a mess broke out in front 
of the Wolverines’ net and a shot 
bounced off LaFontaine onto the 
stick of a Spartan forward, he still 
managed to block the follow-up 
shot.

Michigan 
State 
goaltender 

John 
Lethemon 
faced 
a 

significantly smaller challenge — 
he saw just five shots compared to 
LaFontaine’s 14 — but managed to 
keep the score locked at zero.

“We 
didn’t 
compete 
hard 

enough,” said Michigan coach 
Red Berenson. “For me, it’s 
compete. It’s preparation and 
compete. Whether last night’s 
game influenced tonight’s game 
in anyway, I don’t know. I thought 
we had to be better tonight, and 
we weren’t even close to being 
better. We took a step backwards.”

As the clock wound down to 

end the first period, freshman 
forward Adam Winborg brought 
the puck to the Spartans’ end of 
the ice. The crowd pressured him 
to shoot it, and he did, but with 

no luck. Both teams entered the 
second period scoreless.

A 
penalty 
on 
sophomore 

forward Brendan Warren almost 
led to Michigan State’s first goal 
of the game. The puck was left 
in perfect position for a goal 
after bouncing off LaFontaine, 
but was immediately knocked 
away by a Michigan defensemen, 
and the penalty kill proved to be 
sufficient.

But from there, the night 

seemed to derail. A little over 
seven minutes into the period, 
Spartan forward Rhett Holland 
scored to put Michigan State 
ahead. And after a short scuffle 
in front of the net, it looked as 
if LaFontaine would have to be 
taken out of the game after a 
player fell on his leg.

Though he ended up staying 

in the game for a few additional 
minutes, 
he 
was 
ultimately 

replaced by senior goaltender 
Zach Nagelvoort with 8:04 left in 
the game.

After the change in net, a 

turnover in the Wolverines’ zone 
led to a second Spartan goal, 
this time by defenseman Zach 
Osburn. And with 50 seconds left 
on the clock in the second period, 
Michigan State forward Taro 
Hirose scored on a short-handed 
breakaway to push the Spartans 
to a three-goal lead.

With 
Michigan 
State 

defenseman Mitch Elliot serving 
a penalty at the beginning of 
the third period, it seemed as if 
Michigan might be able to cut the 
deficit. But less than a minute in, 
Appleton brought the puck close 
to the net, and this time, he didn’t 
fail to capitalize — propelling 
the puck past Nagelvoort for the 
fourth goal of the night. 

“It’s unacceptable,” said senior 

defenseman 
Nolan 
De 
Jong. 

“You go on a man advantage and 
you’ve got to keep a five-on-five 
mentality. You’ve got to be able 
to go out there and compete and 
outwork a team even though you 
have that extra man. It just comes 
down to a matter of making smart 
plays and putting it on the line, 
which we didn’t do.”

Following 
the 
Spartans’ 

fourth goal, a shot from De Jong 
almost resulted in a Michigan 
goal but bounced off the post. 
A number of Michigan State 
penalties provided power-play 
opportunities for the Wolverines, 
but none of them were capitalized 
on.

Freshman defenseman Griffin 

Luce was able to score off a faceoff 
from the point with nine seconds 
left on a power play — his first 
goal of the season — but it wasn’t 
enough to combat the four-goal 
lead built up by the Spartans. 
This time, there was no win and 
no trophy.

Defense blossoms in Bloomington

BLOOMINGTON — Just a few 

weeks ago, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team was completely 
reliant on its offense in order to win.

The Wolverines’ 91-85 win over 

Nebraska on Jan. 14 showcased 
what many thought would be the 
strategy Michigan would have to 
take to pick up any future wins.

Even Michigan head coach John 

Beilein, knew to a degree, that the 
Wolverines had to rely solely on 
their ability to outscore opponents 
to find any success in the conference 
schedule.

But Beilein believed that inciting 

any action from the Wolverines on 
the defensive end would halt their 
dependence on putting up massive 
point tallies to win games.

“We can score points as you can 

see,” Beilein said following that win. 
“Trying to outscore people, you still 
have to defend better. We’re not 
doing that. We don’t have the depth 
or right players to do that. We’ve got 
to find these little steps to try and 
get better.”

A month after those comments, 

Michigan won a basketball game — 
thanks in large part to its defense.

On Sunday, the Wolverines 

prevented Indiana from finding any 
sort of rhythm on offense, forcing 
the Hoosiers to commit 15 turnovers 
in Michigan’s 75-63 win.

Though it might be hard to 

believe, the same team that gave 
up 85 points to the Cornhuskers’ 
unspectacular offense in Ann Arbor 
transformed into the one that shut 
down Indiana offensively for 40 
minutes in Bloomington.

“I want to embrace the fact that 

we had a great overall game, start 
to finish,” said senior guard Derrick 
Walton Jr. “We had a great defensive 
effort and great defensive principle. 
We stayed in front of guys and knew 
the scouting report. And most of all, 
when the going got tough, we never 
fumbled.”

For Michigan, simplifying its 

defensive scheme and focusing on 
the basics has helped it get the stops 
it needs.

No player better exemplified 

the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 

transformation than junior guard 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman. 
Facing a difficult matchup with 

the Hoosiers’ lead scorer, James 
Blackmon 
Jr., 
Abdur-Rahkman 

didn’t give the Indiana guard any 
breathing room on the perimeter 
and took advantage of his weakness 
in turning the ball over.

Blackmon finished with just 

seven points while committing 
two turnovers. Abdur-Rahkman 
had similar success shutting down 
Blackmon in the Ann Arbor leg 
of the series on Jan. 26, but the 
fact that he was able to replicate 
it in Bloomington was a good sign 
moving forward for the Wolverines.

Michigan’s perimeter defense 

overall, which had the Big Ten’s 
worst 
3-point 
conversion 
rate 

against for much of the season, has 
steadily improved, and turned in its 
best performance to date against 
Indiana.

The 
Wolverines 
forced 
the 

Hoosiers into shooting 21 percent 
from behind the arc and converting 
just four triples the entire game.

Indiana entered as one of the 

conference’s best 3-point shooting 
teams, not just because of its 
talented guard play, but because the 
Hoosiers have a frontcourt that is 
unafraid to launch long shots.

Indiana center Thomas Bryant 

entered Sunday’s game shooting 45 
percent from deep, but didn’t hit 
a single one of his four attempted 
threes. Sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner and redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson stayed in front 
of Bryant outside the post, and 
provided help on defense to prevent 
Bryant from expanding his game 
and becoming dangerous outside 
the paint.

Abdur-Rahkman, Wilson and 

Wagner have all also become 
more vocal on defense, and that 
has helped Michigan improve its 
weaknesses on the defensive end, 
particularly on the perimeter.

“It’s really interesting going into 

a huddle when I hear (Wagner), 
or I hear (Wilson), or (senior 
wing Zak Irvin) instructing other 
players about what we have to do on 
defense,” Beilein said. “That’s really 
healthy for us.”

The Wolverines’ mentality on 

the defensive end has completely 
changed in the past month. While 
there seemed to be apathy for 
making defensive stops culminating 
in the Wolverines’ blowout at 
Illinois and the barnburner against 

the Cornhuskers, Michigan knows 
it has the bodies and talent to be a 
top-half Big Ten defense. 

Walton has taken charge in 

changing mentalities from the point 
guard position, becoming a more 
physical and aggressive presence 
defending opposing guards. That 
mindset has trickled down to his 
teammates, who he believes can all 
become elite defenders.

“We have so much defensive 

potential with all five guys being 
able to stay in front of their guy,” 
Walton said. “There’s a lot of things 
that go into guarding guys; it’s 
schemes, it’s different actions. Just 
making sure we’re on top of that 
with the same effort level, it’s the 
only difference.”

Michigan’s defense, though, still 

has several faults. The Wolverines 
still aren’t a great rebounding team, 
and were outrebounded again by 
the Hoosiers 32-29. Their lack of 
depth puts a cap on how aggressive 
individual players can be to keep 
Michigan out of foul trouble.

But the Wolverines have an 

offense 
powerful 
enough 
to 

overcome some of the lingering 
problems 
that 
remain. 
Fixing 

its 
mentality 
was 
Michigan’s 

biggest hurdle on the defensive 
end, and Sunday showed how 
far the Wolverines have come in 
attempting to fix that problem.

“The energy on that side of the 

ball is just at the level where it 
was elite in the early conference 
and early season,” Walton said. 
“… People know that when we get 
stops, we have such a potent offense. 
Nine times out of 10, when we get 
stops, we’re going to win.”

As 
Michigan 
enters 
the 

homestretch of the regular season, 
its defense appears to be coming 
together and helping to win games 
now more than ever. Holding 
Indiana to 60 and Michigan State to 
57 points earlier in the week shows 
the potential that the Wolverines 
have been holding back defensively.

Now Michigan has to find a way 

to bottle that intensity and ensure it 
can last.

“Just knowing that’s the hump 

we have to get over that made such 
a great story for us earlier in the 
season,” Walton said. “Getting 
back to enjoying playing defense 
and stopping people is all the 
difference.”

Wolverines hold off Badgers, 75-66

On New Year’s Day, the No. 

21 Michigan women’s basketball 
team traveled to the Kohl Center 
and defeated Wisconsin, 73-56. 
Sophomore center Hallie Thome 
scored 37 points and nabbed 14 
rebounds that day.

Thome did not have quite as 

many points or rebounds Sunday 
— notching 13 and 6, respectively. 
This time it was junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty who led the 
Wolverines to victory over the 
Badgers by a score of 75-66. 
Flaherty finished the game with 
35 points, just three shy of her 
record set on Jan. 7 against Ohio 
State.

Michigan (10-2 Big Ten, 21-5 

overall) earned the win despite 
the struggles of guard Kysre 
Gondrezick. 
The 
freshman 

sensation scored just three points 
in the entire contest.

“We had to grind out a tough 

one today,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “Our ability to 
do that is positive. Anytime you 
can get a victory, we’re definitely 
going to take it.”

Wisconsin (1-11, 6-19) proved 

to be a pesky opponent for the 
Wolverines, as the Badgers trailed 
just 55-51 with nine minutes to go 
in the final quarter. But senior 
guard Siera Thompson pulled 
down a defensive rebound, found 
Thome for a layup, and Wisconsin 
never recovered.

It wasn’t only the fourth 

quarter where the Badgers kept 
the game close, though.

The Wolverines had difficulties 

on the glass in the first quarter, 
as 
Wisconsin 
outrebounded 

Michigan, 13-7. Despite those 
rebounding woes, the Wolverines 
held a 13-12 advantage at the 
end of the frame thanks to 
seven points from Flaherty. The 
Badgers abetted Michigan’s cause 
by turning the ball over six times 
in the opening frame.

“We definitely need to rebound 

better,” 
Flaherty 
said. 
“But 

eventually we found people in 

good positions. I just felt good 
today. A lot of my shots were open, 
which wasn’t the case the past 
couple of games.”

More issues cropped up for 

the Wolverines in the second 
stanza. Michigan made just six of 
its 12 free throws and mustered 
merely two offensive rebounds. 
Gondrezick added to the woes, 
by not registering a single point, 
rebound or assist in the first half. 
It prompted Barnes Arico to give 
her five minutes off, and little 
went right for the Wolverines 
early in the game.

But Flaherty once again came 

to the rescue. She netted 14 points 
in the second, including the first 
five points of the quarter, which 
allowed Michigan to take a 35-29 
lead into halftime.

“I’m grateful every day that I 

have Katelynn Flaherty on our 
team,” Barnes Arico said. “There 
are some days when Katelynn’s 
shot might not be falling, or 
some days where teams are face 
guarding her, and she doesn’t get 
very many open looks. But the 

attention that she draws each 
and every single day, whether she 
has a day where she scores 35, 
whether she has a day where she 
scores 11, is a difference maker for 
our team.”

The third frame threatened 

to go the way of the first two, 
as Wisconsin made two quick 
baskets to cut its deficit to two 
points. Michigan was in danger 
of falling to an opponent that 
walked into Sunday’s contest with 
only one Big Ten win.

Then junior forward Jillian 

Dunston stepped up. After getting 
in foul trouble in the first half, 
her first play of the second half 
involved forcing a steal, beating 
Badger forward Marsha Howard 
to the ball and racing down the 
court for a layup. The Wolverines 
maintained a lead of at least four 
points for the remainder of the 
game.

“When 
we 
don’t 
have 

(Dunston) in the game, we’re a 
different team,” Barnes Arico 
said. “She provides so much 
energy and so much hustle. She 

has such an incredible motor.”

From there, sophomore guard 

Nicole Munger tallied six points 
in the third quarter, which gave 
Michigan a 52-46 lead heading 
into the final quarter. Munger 
finished Sunday with her first 
career double-double, tallying 12 
points and 10 rebounds.

The 
difficulty 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ 
schedule 
will 

increase substantially over the 
next week, as Michigan prepares 
to travel to Indiana (7-5, 17-8) 
on Thursday before taking on 
Michigan State (6-6, 16-9) at 
Crisler Center on Sunday. The 
Wolverines know they will have 
to clean up Sunday’s issues in 
order to emerge victorious in 
those contests.

“Today, I don’t think we did a 

great job of taking away the other 
team’s strength,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Knowing your personnel 
and knowing, ‘Okay, if that kid is 
going to go right shoulder, right 
shoulder,’ or if a kid is going to 
drive left. We need to be able to be 
locked into those things.”

Flaherty resurfaces 
in win over Badgers 

In the Michigan women’s 

basketball team’s previous two 
games, Kysre Gondrezick has 
been stuffing the stat sheet.

The freshman point guard has 

led the Wolverines in scoring 
in those contests — typically 
a mainstay of junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty — putting up 
a career-high 25 points against 
Purdue on Wednesday.

But on Sunday afternoon, 

Flaherty returned to her role 
as the team’s most elite scorer, 
barraging Wisconsin for 35 
points on 12-for-17 shooting — 
including six 3-pointers — in 
Michigan’s 75-66 win over the 
Badgers. The performance was 
her second-best scoring total 
and trails only the 38-point 
outburst she posted Jan. 7 in 
a loss to Ohio State — a game 
she wishes she could’ve bested 
against Wisconsin.

“I wasn’t really thinking 

about 
(breaking 
my 
point 

record) until I saw it and I was 
kinda frustrated with missing 
my foul shots. I was just happy 
that we were winning. … (Jillian 
Dunston) set great screens so a 
lot of my shots were wide open, 
which they haven’t been in the 
past two games.”

Like sophomore center Hallie 

Thome, who had a career-best 37 
points and grabbed 14 rebounds 
in the Wolverines’ previous 
matchup at Wisconsin, Sunday’s 
contest offered a similar aura 
with Flaherty leading the charge. 
But Flaherty’s efforts proved to 
be much more important this 
time around, as the Badgers kept 
their deficit within single digits 
throughout most of the match.

In the first quarter, Flaherty 

seemed to be the only player who 
could put the ball in the basket. 
While she shot 3-for-5, the rest 
of the team struggled, going just 

3-for-13, and the rest of the game 
carried along to the same accord.

Flaherty’s seven first-quarter 

points appeared to be just 
another day at the office for 
her, but after the first inbounds 
pass of the following period, 
Wisconsin couldn’t contain her. 
She finished the quarter with 14 
points, hitting three treys and 
maneuvering her way to the 
basket at will.

“Some of the shots, me and 

(assistant coach Megan Duffy) 
were laughing on the bench,” 
said sophomore guard Nicole 
Munger, who finished the game 
with her first career double-
double. “She was like five feet 
behind the 3-point line, fading 
backward. It’s Kate, she’s gonna 
make them.”

Flaherty kept Michigan alive 

throughout the game, but her 
most crucial baskets came in 
a timely fashion. At both the 
3:38 and 2:28 marks of the final 
quarter, Flaherty aggressively 
charged toward the basket and 
picked up consecutive and-1 
layups to bring the Wolverines’ 
lead 
to 
double 
digits 
and 

effectively put the game away.

“It 
just 
gave 
us 
such 

momentum,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico. “She 
was really incredible. She really 
did a great job of finishing. You 
can find people (down low), 
but making the plays does not 
always happen and Katelynn can 
finish so many plays. Her and 
(Munger) put the team on their 
backs and really pulled out this 
victory for us.”

Gondrezick’s 
recent 

emergence as a prolific scorer 
has been a welcome sight for 
Michigan, but after scoring just 
three points against the Badgers, 
even she has learned that in light 
of Flaherty’s previous struggles, 
it’s always reassuring when 
Katelynn Flaherty is hitting her 
shots.
