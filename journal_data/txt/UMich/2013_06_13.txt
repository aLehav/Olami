LaPlante retires after 16 yars

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan men's head track
and field coach Fred LaPlante
announced his retirement on
Monday, marking the end of a short
head-coaching career as the 11th
coach in program history
After 16 years of service to the
University, LaPlante has decided
to move on with the next phase of
his life.
The Wolverines will begin
their search for his replacement
immediately.
During his 36 years of coaching,
LaPlante has helped with 18
athletes earning Olympic berths,
and has coached 25 national
champions and 83 All-Americans.
But the three-time NCAA District
Head Coach of the Year knew it was
time to take off his running shoes

and continue his life in Ann Arbo
with his wife, Nancy.
"I have enjoyed my experience
with all of University of Michigan
Athletics and especially the men'
track and field program," LaPlant
said in a statement to the athleti
department. "I want to thank th
student-athletes and fellow coache
that I have been fortunate enougl
to work with as well as all thos
who work and have worked in th
athletic department, includin,
administrators and support staff.
"I'm sure the program will mov
forward with great success in th
future, and I wish the very best fo
everyone."
LaPlante was the head coach o
the men's team since 2008. Befor
that, he served as an assistant hea
coach from 1997-2008. In his las
year as an assistant coach, he wa

before he moved to the Midwest,
where he held took an assistant
men's head coaching job for his
alma mater, Eastern Michigan.
LaPlante remained in the position
from 1988 to 1992.
Since his time as the Wolverines'
head coach, LaPlante has had three
runners compete in the Olympic
games, including Adam Harris
(200-meter dash, Guyana, 2008),
Stann Waithe (4x400-meter relay,
Trinidad, 2008) and Jeff Porter
(110-meter high hurdles, USA,
2012). In addition, he coached
the USA's Jerome Singleton, who
competed in the World Paralympic
Championship 100-meter dash in
2011.
LaPlante has already finished
recruiting for the 2013-2014 season,
after he inked 10 athletes in March.

Plans
for grad
housing
progress
University buys
final two properties
needed for building
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
Graduate students, get
ready. The University's plan to
provide a housing complex just
for graduate students is moving
right along.
The Michigan Daily report-
ed in April that the residence
hall would house 600 students
in a 370,000-square-foot,
eight-story building on South
Division Street. The project
was made possible by a dona-
tion of $110 million from Uni-
versity alum Charles Munger.
The location was secured
by acquiring the current site
of Blimpy Burger, four houses
previously owned by former
Athletic Director Bill Martin
and two houses that Copi
Properties leases to students.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman first announced
plans for construction at a Uni-
versity Board of Regents meet-
ing in April. As of Tuesday, the
University reached an agree-
ment with Copi Properties and
closed on the purchase of two
houses. The University will pay
$1.5 million for both properties.
After the April board meet-
ing in which the project
was approved, a resolution
that would have allowed the
administration to use eminent
domain - the state's power to
take private property for pub-
lic use - if necessary was also
approved.

laptop could help
insider trading case
By KATIE BURKE
Editor in Chief
There may be a new break-
through in the five-year-old
insider trading case against hedge
fund SAC Capital. The University
is working out a tentative deal
with the U.S. Attorney's office to
allow access to former Neurol-
ogy Prof. Sidney Gilman's laptop
computer, which could provide
evidence of insider trading.
Gilman retired in November
after being accused by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Com-
mission of assisting traders with
inside information. It is alleged
that he provided non-public infor-
mation regarding a clinical trial of

an Alzheimer drug produced by
Elan Corporation and Wyeth, Inc.,
owned by Pfizer, Inc.
Gilman's information on the
negative effects of the drug
reportedly allowed Matthew
Martoma, a hedge fund portfolio
manager for CR Intrinsic
Investors, to short sell the drug
company's securities, turning
a profit of over $276 million.
Martoma's firm is a subsidiary
of SAC, whose CEO, Steven A.
Cohen, has been under scrutiny
for insider trading by the SEC.
According to an SEC press
release of the Nov. 20 trial, Gil-
man, who was moonlighting at
an expert network firm, gave
Martoma information on the
Phase II trial two weeks before
it was to go public in July, 2008.
Expert firms came into
existence after the SEC issued
the Regulation Fair Disclosure
rule in 2000 - known as "Reg.

F.D." - mandating public
companies to release to all
investors simultaneously
"market-moving" information.
These firms allow hedge funds
to do their own research into
the fields in which they invest
instead of waiting for the infor-
mation to go public. While such
independent research is legal,
acting on knowledge classified as
non-public is not.
The release also stated that,
after receiving the information,
Martoma had a number of funds
sell $960 million in Elan and
Wyeth securities in about a week.
According to the release, Gil-
man and Martoma discussed
confidential PowerPoint presen-
tations regarding the trial, and
Gilman received $100,000 from
Martoma for the information -
he made $1,000 per hour for his
consulting work at the firm.

Abecasis receives
third award from
Thomson Reuters
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Successful research must be
in the genes of Biostatistics Prof.
Goncalo Abecasis, as he secured
his third recognition from the
intellectual Property & Science
business of Thomson Reuters as
one of the "Hottest Researchers"
of 2012.
The program names
researchers in various fields each
year based on the total number
of citations their papers receive
throughout the year. Abecasis,
who is also the director of the
Michigan Genomic Initiative,
was recognized by Reuters for
his work in biostatistics.
Abecasis has been with the
University since 2001 and his
work has focused primarily on
genetics and genomics. He has
worked to "map" the human
genome, finding all the genetic
variations for each gene to
create a better understanding of
the body. He then studies these
discrepancies in order to find
their links to diseases.
Abecasis said the diseases he
investigates are those that are
largely genetic, such as macular
degeneration or diabetes.
"Once you know, for example,
if I can 'break' this gene I will
lower your risk of disease,"
Abecasis said, "Then you might
say, 'Well, it may be a good idea
for trying to prevent disease is to
design a drug that also blocks the
gene.'
Fellow Biostatistics Prof.
Michael Boehnke helped
recruit Abecasis to University
in 2001 and now works with
him. Boehnke said the two have
been able to locate hundreds of
genome locations and specific
genes linked to different
diseases.
Boehnke said Abecasis's
research award is "easily"
well deserved, and Abecasis is
"intellectually brilliant" and a
great collaborator. His ability

Redshirt junior Kiley Tobel set a new school record and personal record in the pole
vault with a height of 4.25 meters. Tobel finished 10th for the second straight year.

Biostatistics professor Goncalo Abecasis describes the genome sequencing and DNA mapping processes.

problems is what sets him apart
in the scientific community,
Boehnke said,
Abecasis said the Reuters
award tends to fit better in
different fields because his line
of work naturally gets cited
more often. He said while it was
satisfyingto have so many people
cite his papers, the award was
never his goal.
"If something like this
happens it's kind of nice and it's
kind of the icing on the cake,"
Abecasis said. "But you don't
plan your research to say, 'Oh,
I'm going to get a lot of citations,'
you say, 'Hey, what are the big
questions?' and you try and
tackle them."
While a combination of genetic
and genomic projects helped
sustain Abecasis's recognition
from Reuters, Abecasis said one
of his favorite projects was the
"1000 Genomes Project," an
effort with Oxford University
to sequence human genomes
of people across the world.
Abecasis said before this project
started in 2007, there were only
about 20 fully sequenced human

genomes ever completed.
"We really managed to take
sequencing technologies and
what we know about human
variation forward quite a bit,"
Abecasis said. "Now it's a basic
resource for genetic studies."
Boehnke discussed another
successful project for Abecasis:
the developing of statistical
method where genomic data
from other people is used to more
efficiently build a new human
genome. Boehnke said this
method is hugely beneficial to
biostatistics work for the future.
"A half dozen years ago when
Goncalo was the key developer
of this, there were many people
who were skeptical it would
work," Boehnke said. "Now you
don't even necessarily question
where this came from because
it's so standard and fundamental
to what we all do."
Currently, Abecasis continues
to help build a database of genetic
information through projects
possibly involving thousands
of patients. Abecasis said he
is working on finding a better
method of obtaining the human

genome, saying that current
strategies often don't include all
the details and variations.
"Right now most analysis
typically compares a genome
to the reference that was built
in part manually and over a
long period of time so they miss
things where any individual
is very different from that
referenced genome," Abecasis
said. "We're working to come
up with methods where we can
rebuild an individual's genome
almost from scratch."
In the past, the limitations of
sequencing genomes had much
to do with goals that reached
beyond the technology available
as well as financial constraints.
However, Abecasis said, just
within the past decade there
have been major advancements
that make sequencing more
efficient through the use of
micro-arrays, allowing several
genes and their variations to be
observed all at once.
Abecasis said he hopes his
work will be the next step in
advancing genome sequencing.

Finishing 47th might not seem
like an accomplishment.
But for the Michigan women's
track and field team, the
finish in the NCAA Outdoor
Championships at the University
of Oregon's historic Hayward
Field was already a better result
than last year.
The Wolverines' four runners
are an improvement from last
year, when the team sent three
competitors to the event and
scored no points.
With two returning athletes
competing, Michigan was in
good position to put points on the
board, but it was a newcomer to
the national stage who ultimately
scored those points. Fifth-year
senior Amanda Eccleston, a
transfer from NCAA Division II
program Hillsdale College, took
fifth in the 1,500-meter run and
earned the team its only four
points.
In what has become nearly a
broken record now, Eccleston
once again set a personal-best
mark in her signature race, this
time finishing in 4:14.56. Her
top-five finish did not come
without difficulty, however.
Eccleston almost missed
qualifying for the finals, having
to grind her way into the

semifinals by securing the 12th
and final at-large spot before she
struggled early on in the final
race.
"I was pretty much in last right
off the bat, so it made a little bit
of the race kind of hard to work
my way up through," Eccleston
said. "But I was able to run pretty
well on the inside, and I was able
to move up a bit throughout, and
on the final straightaway I went
from seventh or eighth to fifth."
Eccleston's fifth-place fin-
ish marked an impressive end to
what has been a very successful
collegiate career. After dominat-
ing at the Division II level for
four years, including a national
championship last year in the
1,500-meter run, Eccleston
transferred to Michigan for
her final year of eligibility. She
proved her national champion-
ship last year was no fluke, and
was rewarded with All-Amer-
ican first team honors for her
fifth-place performance.
"It was just a really great
opportunity to come out and
represent Michigan, and a great
way to finish out my college
career," she said.
Eccleston was joined on the
track by teammate and co-captain
senior Rebecca Addison, who
concluded her four-yearcollegiate
career at Michigan in the 1,500
meter run with a 23rd-place

finish in the semifinals. Though most f
her time did not qualify her for and it's
the finals, she earned an All- really
American honorable mention for watchi
her showing. excited

"I was really excited to end last ye
my season on such a high note," points,
Tobel said. "Last year at the
national meet I didn't have my
best performance at that meet, so
to come out this year and be able
to do my very best at the national
meet was something I really
wanted to accomplish this year."
Rounding out the quartet
was senior Erin Pendleton, who
finished 18th in the discus by
improving on each of her three
throws to record a final toss of
49.96 meters. The school record-
holder in the discus throw,
Pendleton was making her third-
career appearance in the NCAA
Championships after missing
out last year. She earned an All-
American honorable mention
as she closed out her collegiate
career.
"I thought overall all of the
kids performed to their highest
potential," said Michigan coach
James Henry. "I was really happy
with the girls that did qualify
and we had a few that came very
close. I was really happy with the
performances we had this week
in Eugene - they were all very
competitive."
The Wolverines will take a
small yet notable hit from to their
roster in the offseason, as three
of the four athletes competing at
the Outdoor Championships will
be graduating.
For Eccleston, Addison, Tobel
and Pendleton, the opportunity
to compete at one of the most
historic tracks in the country was
a once-in-a-lifetime experience
and an exciting way to end their
careers.
"It's really exciting, because
Hayward Field is probably the

The season of rebuilding that turned into more

In a season that was expected
to be fraught with losses during a
process of rebuilding, the Michi-
gan baseball team exceeded expec-
tations by taking its first steps back
into college
baseball rel- LAX
evancy. COHEN
From
the time On Baseball
his players
arrived on campus in the fall to
the end of the season, first-year
Michigan coach Erik Bakich
instilled a winning culture in a
program that had many more losses
than wins in recent memory. Once
the season began, the newfound
expectation of winning became
evident while the Wolverines (14-10
Big Ten, 29-27 overall) consistently
battled back from adversity to earn
the program's first berth to the Big
Ten Tournament since 2010.
"This team was on a mission to
really bring the winning culture
back to Michigan," Bakich said.
"You prepare and you play with the
expectation that you're going to be

competing for championships."
The leadership council,
comprised of senior center fielder
Pat Biondi, junior outfielder
Michael O'Neill, senior right-
hander Kyle Clark, senior right-
hander Ben Ballantine and senior
right-hander Chad Jasman, worked
throughout the season to help their
coach instill the winning culture
among their younger teammates.
You could see it had paid off on
thefinalregular-seasongame,when
the Wolverines not only earned a
Big Ten Tournament bid, but also
trounced Nebraska in the process.
Though Michigan was eliminated
from the double-elimination tour-
nament after two games, its appear-
ance demonstrated the beginning of
success in the program.
"As a coach, your goal is to get
the maximum potential out of your
team," Bakich said. "I felt like with
this particular group, we squeezed
every drop, every ounce of energy
out of it."
There were times during the
season when using every ounce of

energy wasn't enough for the Wol-
verines. Michigan took its lumps,
particularly during, a 12-game
stretch in which the Wolverines
went 5-7 when Biondi was out
because of a sprained thumb.
All season long, Biondi encapsu-
lated the spirit of the team in ways
not visible in the box scores. When
he returned from his thumb injury,
he couldn't swing a bat. Yet he was
in the Michigan lineup during the
team's sweep of Michigan State,
attempting to bunt for a base hit
each time at the plate while playing
his usual rangy defense.
"It just captured everybody's
enthusiasm and just really was a
huge sparkplug and a catalyst for
us," Bakich said.
Biondi continued to demonstrate
the new winning mentality of the
program by playing through an
injury later in the season. He even
switched to second base duringthe
final series of the regular season
- the last of his Michigan career
- so that Bakich could put the best
lineup on the field.

As the Wolverine baseball pro-
gram looks forward, it will have
to do so without the leaders who
helped precipitate the team's
change in mentality. With Bakich
at the helm, Michigan will look to
new leaders to carry the program
into the next phase of its develop-
ment as Biondi and O'Neill pursue
professional baseball careers.
Bakich sees a trio of freshmenn
shortstop Travis Maezes, second
baseman Jacob Cronenworth
and left-hander Evan Hill as
future leaders because they
already established themselves
as workhorses on and off the field
this season. Bakich looks forward
to the arrival of next year's highly
touted recruiting class, his first at
Michigan as he looks to guide the
team to the next level.
The incoming class drummed
up more excitement when four
of the players were selected on
the third day of the MLB Draft.
Bakich expects them all not only to
come to Michigan, but to help the
program do much more than earn a

bid to the Big Ten Tournament.
"While everybody was happy
to get to the Big Ten Tournament,
everybody also realizes that this
past year was the worst year
Michigan baseball is going to have
moving forward," Bakich said.
And he could be right. Especially
since he doesn't have to spend time
implementing a winning attitude.

'U' professor
to serve as U.S.
Economics
Councilmember
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily StaffReporter
On Monday, President Barack
Obama announced that he has
nominated Betsey Stevenson,
associate prof. of public policy,
to serve as a member on his
Council of Economic Advisors.
The CEA, an agency within
the Obama administration, is
responsible for advising the
president on issues related to
economic policy and present
potential solutions. Stevenson
will work alongside a chairman
and one other member to shape
economic policies for the
coming year.
Public Policy Dean Susan
M. Collins said Stevenson
had a reputation as a "highly-
regarded labor economist"
and noted the importance of
the CEA in shaping national
economic policy.
"(Stevenson) cares deeply
about the application of her
work to real-world policy
problems," Collins said in a
press release. "We're pleased
and honored that she was
chosen for this distinguished
service."
Economist Jason Furman
was simultaneously nominated
to be the CEA Chairman -
replacing Alan Krueger, who
had chosen to step down from

the position.
Collins said in an interview
with The Michigan Daily that
Stevenson's expertise in labor
markets and her experience
as Chief Economist for the
U.S. Department of Labor
would complement Furman's
knowledge of financial markets
and macroeconomics, making
her a fit candidate for the
position.
"(The CEA) is intended to
span the key economic issues
that the president would like
and would need their advice
on in the year to come,"
Collins said. "Certainly issues
related to labor market and
employment are extremely
important in that regard."
Collins added that
Stevenson's expertise was very
relevant to certain aspects of
the president's agenda.
"I would expect that
(Stevenson's) expertise on
issues related to women and
families would certainly play
a part in some of the work that
she would do," she said.
Though no formal start date
has been announced, Stevenson
will start her term at the White
House this summer. It is
unclear how long Stevenson's
appointment will last and
when she will return to the
University.
"She has a lease for the
coming year and I would be
surprised if she were to request
an extension," Collins said.
"But that's still unfolding, I
would say."
Stevenson was unavailable
for comment.

The innovative mindset
Expanding entrepreneurial programs would benefit students
Entrepreneurship at the University has strong roots in the College of
Engineering and at the Ross School of Business. Two separate cen-
ters - the Center for Entrepreneurship at the College of Engineering
and the Zell Lurie Institute at the Ross School of Business - have created
strong entrepreneurial communities in their respective schools for students
interested in the field. But these two schools combined only represent about
a quarter of the entire student population, and their programs could be more
accessible to the rest of the University. Although many of the CFE and the
institute's resources are open to all students, the University should make a
broader effort to bring entrepreneurship opportunities to undergraduates

SCHOOL OF SCARES
Breathing new life
intoM 'Mntrs'

Dan Scanlon and Kori
Rae talk resurrecting
a Pixar favorite
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Film Editor
Thirteen years ago, "Monsters,
Inc." took us to the world beneath
our beds and behind our closet
doors, where the scary stuff of
our imaginations prowled. Like
most Pixar features, it delighted
us. It fed not fear, but the better
part of our imaginations, turning
that shadowy world into some-
thing whimsical: It made mon-
sters work-a-day scarers.
Now, Pixar brings us a prequel,
"Monsters University," to that
2001 box-office smash. It's an
origin story of what makes scar-
ers scarers and how our favorite
monster duo, Michael "Mike"
Wazowski (Billy Crystal, "When
Harry Met Sally...") and Sulley
(John Goodman, "Argo"), met in
college, and how an iconic ani-
mation friendship flourished.
To provide their fans insight
into what it was like resurrecting
this beloved work, director Dan
Scanlon, in his feature debut, and
producer Kori Rae shared their
own stories in a conference call
the Michigan Daily recently took
part in.
"We loved the relationship of
Mike and Sulley and we always
wanted to do something with
them again," Scanlon said. "And
that's where we started thinking
about how these guys met, which
led naturally to the college idea,
and we loved the idea of doing
something in a university."
The idea of finding the
film's heroes in a college set-
ting inspired the two filmmak-
ers, who had to perform some
research of their own in recreat-
ing that experience onscreen.
"We wanted to make sure that
since we were doing a university
movie," Scanlon said, "that we
had sort of the great university
archetypes."
"In the end," Rae added, "(We)

5ut them all together to create a
campus that, although it's origi-
nal to Monsters University, hope-
fully it feels familiar to everyone.
I would hope that everyone kind
of feels like, 'Hey, that's my
school!' "
Among the more colorful
dimensions of "Monsters Univer-
sity" would have to be its Greek
system, such as Oozma Kappa,
described by Scanlon as the
"scare rejects" who failed to get
into the vaunted program.
But aside from the humor and
outrageous antics the college
setting may offer, the two film-
makers and their writers also
conceived Monsters University
as .a spiritual crossroads in the
lives of its characters.
"We have a character - a Scott
Squishy Squibbles, who is kinda
classic 18-year-old college stu-
dent that hasn't decided what
they want to be," Scanlon said.
"They're sort of a ball of clay
waiting to be molded. In his case,
he's literally a mushy tiny ball of
amorphous clay."
"That's kind of where you first
are out on your own, you just
figure out who you are, who you
want to be," Rae said. "You can
reinvent yourself."
Both Scanlon and Rae found
they had some searching to do
themselves in creating this pre-
quel. This is, after all, Scanlon's
directorial debut, and Rae has
the awesome expectations of
building upon a beloved 2000s
classic children film that she
herself worked on.
But it's a challenge she's
familiar with, owing to the wild
success of Pixar in the 1990s.
Lucky for her, those seemingly
insurmountable expectations,
imposed- time and time again,
have forced her to learn more
and grow.
"We learn so much on every
single film," she said. "You learn
something different from each
one, because you're working with
different people, different direc-
tors. I used a ton of stuff on this
film that I had learned on 'The
Incredibles,' let's say, in addition

to 'Monsters, Inc.' and even as
far back as 'A Bug's Life.' So all of
that experience rounded me out
and gave me a good base to pro-
duce this one."-
Like Rae, Scanlon has had a
working career in Pixar, which
includes award-winning features
such as "Cars" and "Toy Story
3." But "Monsters University" is
his first opportunity to sit in the
director's chair.
"Being a director, I got the rare
opportunity to see everything.
To see what everyone does,"
Scanlon said. "A lot of people I've
worked with for years and eaten
lunch with, but really had no idea
what they did and there I'd be in
a meeting with them and think,
'Oh wow. You're a genius, like
you're the best person who does
this.'"
But for both filmmakers, the
creation of "Monsters Univer-
sity" gravitates back toward the
same basic principle of every one
of their works.
"We always want to touch
something in people, emotionally
with our films," Scanlon said.
With "Monsters University,"
in particular, he wanted his audi-
ences to experience the char-
acters' transformations that he
himself faced in college.
"You let go of the thing that
you think you absolutely have to
be to be happy in order to find
out who you truly are," Scanlon
said. "That feeling of realizing,
'This is going to be a lot harder
than I thought.' Or, 'Maybe I'm
not the person that I thought I
was.' "
Perhaps, then, it was Scan-
lon who best characterized the
confusion and angst our heroes
endure in "Monsters University"
in his description of the uncer-
tainty of filmmaking:
"Every Pixar movie goes
through an awkward teenage
phase where it doesn't make
sense, or it's bizarre, or it's not
quite working right," he said.
"And you can get terrified that
you're never going to crack it.
And it's just this relentless jour-
ney to keep trying new things."

to shoot a modern-day adaptation
of Shakespeare's comedy "Much
Ado About Nothing" in his home
in Santa Monica. In just 12 days.
The result? An infectiously fun
romantic comedy that captures
the spirit of the original play,
with touches of Whedon's own
genius, including some brilliant-
ly blocked physical comedy that
seems so simple and yet warrants
the huge laughs.
The low-budget aesthetic -
.scenes supposedly taking place in
the local police station look more
like they were filmed in a barely
disguised living room - makes
it feel, at times, like the whole
production is just a bunch of old
friends hanging out, drinking
wine and doing theater together.
But it's exactly this un-cinematic
quality that adds to the whimsi-
cal charm of the endeavor. Shot
on a 35 mm digital camera and
then rendered in black and white,
the production is stripped of the
pomp and circumstance that
accompany many Shakespeare
film adaptations.
The performances, too, are
stripped down. Whedon coaxes
magnificent performances out
of almost everyone. Fran Kranz
delighted as wise stoner Marty
in Whedon's "The Cabin in the
Woods" last year, but here he
makes a 180-degree transfor-
mation to become the lovesick,
clean-cut Claudio. "Firefly"
fans will rejoice at the sight of
Nathan Fillion as the dimwit
local sheriff, who is - it should

be noted - an ass.
But it's reunited "Angel" co-
stars Alexis Denisof and Amy
Acker (as reluctant lovers and
verbal-sparring mates Benedick
and Beatrice, respectively) who
tackle the text most masterfully,
their quick tongues spitting out
line after wit-soaked line dur-
ing their characters' famed quip
wars. Denisof captures both
Benedick's charisma and more
dickish qualities, and Acker daz-
zles with an award-worthy per-
formance.
The script is almost complete-
ly faithful to the original text,
with the exception of an added
flashback that serves as excel-
lent exposition for the Beatrice-
Benedick love battle. Whedon
modernizes with nuanced ease:
One look at the sleek suits worn
by Don Pedro (Reed Diamond,
TV's "Dollhouse") and his crew
reveals that the "war" they've
returned from is one waged not
on a real battlefield, but in stock
markets and boardrooms. Pot,
tequila shots, iPods and Barbies
ground us in our own world.
The dialogue only feels jarringly
anachronistic in a few moments,
particularly as characters chat
of arranged marriages and next-
day weddings as they mill about
Whedon's HGTV-ready kitchen.
But again, the power of the
performances allows for sus-
pension of disbelief. The natu-
ral response to Beatrice asking
Benedick to murder Claudio to
avenge her defamed cousin Hero
(newcomer Jillian Morgese) is
to laugh, but Acker's conviction
in her- subsequent monologue
reveals that Whedon's "Much
Ado" has more to offer than
boozy, woozy fun. Acker por-
trays Beatrice as the feminist
hero she's meant to be, and her
rage-filled monologue is easily
the film's finest moment. "O God,
that I were a man! I would eat his
heart in the marketplace," she
punches with commanding pres-
ence.
Turns out, Whedon doesn't
need slayers or superheroes or
space cowboys to make magic.
Give the man 12 days and a
Shakespeare play, and he'll give
you summer's sleeper sensation.

In a conference call, director Marc Forster elaborated on his inspiration for a film that looks to innovate the zombie genre.
Zombies reinvented

Forster discusses
artistic vision of
'World War Z'
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Film Editor
"World War Z" crashes into the-
aters amid the zombie fascination

gripping millions across the globe.
Since the sauntering swarms of
George A. Romero's 1968 "Night of
the Living Dead," we've had fast-
running zombies, manic, red-eyed
zombies and - who could forget -
Nazi zombies. And after all these
memorable riffs on the flesh-eating
walking dead, the director of this
apocalyptic picture starring Brad
Pitt ("Killing Them Softly"), Marc

Forster ("Quantum Solace"), thin]
there remain new and excitit
ways to tell a good zombie story.
Forster believes he has a ne
cinematic vision, details of whi
he was willing to share through
conference call the Michigan Dai
joined.
"I looked at all the zombie mo
ies - especially 'Dawn of the Dea
and '28 Days Later' " Forster sai

"I knew I needed to create some-
thing that differentiates itself from
those movies. I saw what was cre-
ated before and then sort of cre-
ated my own language visually and
emotionally of where I wanted this
film to go to."
In effect, Forster had to decide
what his zombies could and
couldn't do, what their defining
features are and what makes them
compelling enough to warrant a
big-budget film - a zombie rule-
book of sorts.
"I knew that I wanted to set it all
as very real. I didn't want them to
be superhuman and just grounded
all biology," Forster said. "I was
involved in every step of the way
NT because it was important to the
foundation of my vision."
But these zombies don't move
as we've seen them before. They
aren't the jerking fiends of "28 Days
Later" or the gnawing, hungover
corpses of the Romero-breed.
There's a particularly memorable
ks sequence in "World War Z" 's trail-
ng er that Forster shed some light on:
"The human pyramid is a very
w frightening image. I haven't seen
ch it in any zombie movie, and as a
a filmmaker you're always trying to
ly create something new - which in
this case is a tsunami of zombies
v- coming towards you with no way to
d' escape them."
d. Forster further elaborated on
the inspiration of what he believes
to be a zombie innovation:
"As a child, I once witnessed
masses of people at a soccer stadi-
um in Europe as they were trying
to leave after the game, trampling
on top of each other," he said. "I sat
there watching it; frightened from
a child's point of view, realizing
how scary this could be."
Committing himself to this veri-
similitude, in creating a new cin-
ematic experience of this oft-seen
apocalyptic favorite, Forster also
understood another level of depth
should be added to his version of
zombiedom.
"I have often been fascinated by
zombies because they're, as you just
mentioned, a great metaphor, going
back to Romero in the '70s where
they were a take on consumerism,"
Forster said. "We're living in a time
of change and I think every time
the world's been through such a
transformation, zombies have been
very, very popular."
As many filmmakers and writ-
ers before him have done, Forster
opened his film up to the possibility
of the zombies carrying allegorical
weight.
"At some point our planet won't
be able to sustain the amount of
people there are on it," he said. "So

overpopulation becomes more and
more of a concern with fewer and
fewer resources, and if you're look-
ing all around in regards to politics
and economics, it seems like we are
all going after the last resources.
There is almost a mindlessness to it
and I thought that would be a great
metaphor."
Still, the pure spectacle of the
terror and the rush of action of
such an event wasn't lost on For-
ster: "World War Z" is still a sum-
mer blockbuster.
"The ultimate thing is that the
film is a ride from beginning to
end, but it also has another level
to it; which is what I really enjoy
about this film because movies that
accomplish both these things are
sometimes hard to come by - sto-
ries or scripts for summer block-
busters which can provide you
with those fun-ride experiences."
For many directors, that combi-
nation of crowd-pleasing and intel-
ligent storytelling proves difficult
to balance. Even Forster admits he
had to face the possibility of com-
promise.
"Sometimes when you're sur-
rounded by these massive scenes
and you're involved in this incred-
ible time pressure and money
pressure and so one, it can be a
challenge to stick to your vision."
Still, the director appears to be
satisfied with the result.
"I've been lucky enough to say
I've walked away at the end of the
films I've made with the thought,
'Yes my vision was there.' I think
that's the most important thing."

got 99 problems and they all case
files.
Why? Because I'm an intern.
More specifically,
a summer intern
at an intellectual
property law firm
in Chicago.
My first day I
walk in wearing
a J. Crew origami
dress in brilliant NATASHA
berry paired with ERTZBISCHOFF
a skinny black pat-
ent leather belt
and matching kitten heels. Very chic
business casual. I meet my workaholic
boss who has a little too much unruly
chest hair sticking out of his oxford.
He introduces me to all the partners,
paralegals, secretaries and even Tony
the mailroom guy. Everyone seems
very nice. Then he shows me my office.
It seems very nice. I think to myself I
was silly for being so nervous. Wrong-
O. I was in for quite a rude awakening.
The boss man gives me my
first assignment: to look through
6,003 trademark patents to see if there
are any that are similar to his
client's trademark.
Three hours later, after my fingers
have paper cuts that would make a
grown man cry, I receive my second
assignment: to print 1,046 e-mails
(including attachments) on a Dell
computer (a Dell desktop to be pre-
cise). The last time I used one of those
was in the fourth grade to gossip about
N*SYNC on AOL Instant Messenger.
Oh, the woes of doing grunt work
that you will later glorify on your resu-
me. By e-mail number 100, my brain is
comatose and I feel my University edu-
cation oozing out of my ears as I drool
on the keyboard pressing CTRL + P.
It's at this point you start to think
of some pretty inventive ways to kill
yourself - material that would be
good enough for an episode of "Law
and Order: Criminal Intent." But
then you think no, killing yourself
is counterproductive. Then another
thought slowly creeps in - maybe
flipping patties at Mickey D's wouldn't
be so bad. Then ... bam.
"NATASHA!"
A scream from your boss jerks you
out of your grease-filled delusions and
you realize that the McDonald's fire
truck red and banana yellow uniform
doesn't go well with your skin tone. So
you collect yourself, knock back a dou-

ble espresso shot and get back to filing.
But I'm being dramatic - it's not all
bad. There are some silver linings and
saving graces. One of which is what
I like to call your workplace guard-
ian angel, a god-sent mentor that will
take you under their tailored-suit
wing. Mine's name is Raquel and she's
a saint. With Lucy Liu looks and the
gumption of Hilary Clinton she's basi-
cally adorbs. Not only does she sit with
me at lunch so I don't look like Cady
from "Mean Girls" on her first day of
school, she also gives me tips on how
to not piss off my boss. Another perk is
that if you work hard enough, people,
important people, will start to notice
you're a go-getter. Then you start get-
ting invited to do things like sit in on
Federal Court cases with a partner.
Oh, the woes
of doing grunt
work.
But all silver linings aside, I still
couldn't help but wonder, "Why the
hell am I even doing this?" So I can
write, "handles outstanding bills and
attorneys fees, reports office actions
and files documents" on my resume?
So I can appease graduate schools?
The truth is as an intern you really
don't know what you're doing or why
you're doing it most of the time. But
that's the point. Interning teaches you
how to be resourceful, how to think
on your feet, how to network and
honestly, just how to think better. All
things that a university can't teach you
but are prerequisites for registering
for the ultimate course called Life.
So my advice to all the
unsuspecting bushy-tailed, wide-eyed
20-something-year-olds out there is
this: keep filing, keep working your ass
off and keep your chin up.
Be proud that you've landed the
ever-coveted internship position. You
may be on the bottom of the corporate
food chain and (to paraphrase more
Jay-Z) you're far from being god, but
you work goddamn hard. And that's
something to be proud of.

or most University stu-
dents, I know the sum-
mer in between classes

save the town, getting the girl
and teaching the world about
the hazards of unchecked greed
and squandered love.
Instead, we busy ourselves
withvariousjobsandinternships,
beginning our slow dance with
that she-devil known as the real
world, listening to her sweet
nothings about uncooperative
Excel spreadsheets as she sinks
her claws deeper into our flesh at
the rate of commuter traffic - all
while she gobbles up graduating
seniors like Amanda Bynes does
crazy pills.
We can't escape the fact that
we are all aboard this one-way
public transportation destined
for the real-world and the only
stops planned are for equipment
failure. Thus, having a total of
one summer and two weeks of
internship experience under my
belt, and being held back a year,
I wanted to share the scariest,
most pant-leg-soiling facet of
real world life I've encountered
yet: our complete obsession with
perfection - and the dread of
failure it instills in us.
We live in a world consumed
with conformity, and when
any notion of perceived failure
knocks at our doorstep we cringe
in fear, quickly closing the blinds
as we mutter under our breath
about the neighborhood's loss
of character.
To accommodate this fear we

Learning to fail

saturate our lives with external
mediums of support. Self-help
books routinely top bestseller
lists, and even a cursory perusal
of the Internet yields just as
much degradation of human inti-
macy as it yields lists compiled to
guarantee a better you. We crave
change regardless of if it's truly
needed, quickly adding a prob-
lem to the 99 we already got in
order to accommodate any pro-
posed solution that seems able to
mitigate our dread of failure.
Yet are we truly so funda-
mentally flawed as to necessitate
such constant assistance? Do we
really need such an abundance of
knowledge advocating the "Five
Best Ways to Commit Genocide
on Stomach Fat"?
I think not - instead we are
more than capable individuals
who have simply become ter-
rified of experimentation and
potential failure. As a society we
can't accept ourselves, and are
thus always searching for the
next update, software or tidbit
of wisdom guaranteed to finally
add that extra thing we've man-
aged to live without for our entire
tenure as organisms, yet some-
how necessitate immediately.
This obsession is both self-
perpetuating and compounding
- it's in our unbridled
pursuit of perfection that we
continually render ourselves
imperfect, always searching for
problems to fix and inhibiting
true self-realization.
Our foundational ideology
touts that it's not your fault you
haven't written the next great
American novel, created that
successful startup or realized
your dream of seeing how many
nights in a row you can order
the late night special milkshake
before throwing it up only a few
hours later - you just didn't
have the right tools. In this
validation we accommodate
our imperfections, ignoring
reality and regulating the

blame elsewhere so that we may
continue our day satisfied yet
unchanged and still just as naive.
As a society
we can't accept
ourselves.
This standard simplifies our
dreams to finite quips, further
enhancing our self-dissatisfac-
tion and enabling our self-help
addiction like a heroin-addict-
ed fat kid locked in a heroin-
dealing candy shop. Ultimately,
if you read enough factoids or
books promising personal nir-
vana, you start to unconscious-
ly believe that nirvana is truly
achieved through such means.
In solving this dilemma, I
won't pretend to know that
The Cure is anything other
than a band, and that the only
Answer I know is , a phenom-
enal basketball player ruined
by ego. I also won't lampoon
you, faithful reader (Hi Mom),
with the irony of a self-help
article detailing the fallacies
of a self-help addicted society.
What I will say is that the most
introspective moments I've had
in life have been after colossal
failures. Times when I've acted
without thinking or regard for
expectations, left completely
leveled and with no choice but
to rebuild my Cheeto-encrusted
self, Lego piece by piece.
This summer, remember that
the entire purpose of falling is
to learn how we individually
get back up. For only then will
we rise up, capable of truly
defending Gotham - or maybe
just doing that thing with
the milkshake.

in existing graduate student
programs.
"(We)have a vision to create a

many disciplines that will provide
opportunities to share scholarship

Construction is expected to
start this fall, and will take about
two years to complete.

Garden to serve as
distraction therapy
for pediatric patients
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily StaffReporter
Tuesday afternoon, patients
and their families, along with
the medical staff of the C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital, gathered in
the new Healing Butterfly Garden
to witness the release of Monarch
and Painted Lady butterflies.
The garden, which reflects
the environment of Ann Arbor,
integrates raising butterflies with
patientcare. The project is the first
garden in the world to do so.
Brendon Weil, a staff specialist
at UMHS, and Susan Fisher, the
radiology grants coordinator,
worked together on the project.
Fisher said she thought the
plan was unrealistic and wouldn't
receive funding. But in the end,
backing came through and the
garden was builLt
"We had no-idea that this many

people would be here and that's
the coolest part," Fisher said after
seeing the full courtyard at the
event.
Fisher added that throughout
the last several years, she has
brought caterpillars from her own
home garden to cancer patients at
the University hospital.
"It's magical to have something
from nature transform right in
front of you," Fisher said.
Dan Fischer, the director of the
Child and Family Life department,
helped with the integration of the
patient care portion of this project.
Fischer said the committee
tried to incorporate fun activities
for children in the hospital to
serve as a distraction therapy.
"My mission is to help kids
develop coping techniques for
being sick in the hospital," Fischer
said. "I think we try to create a
little fun and normalcy out of an
experience that really isn't any of
those things."
The opening of the gardens
also marked the beginning of the
Child and Family Life Butterfly
Explorer Summer Program, for
which Fischer's committee was

responsible.
Through the program,
children in the hospital can
check out backpacks that have
all the materials necessary for a
garden scavenger hunt, such as
magnifying glasses and pictures of
different plants.
The program also includes
butterfly arts and crafts sessions
every Tuesday for children who
are not able to go out into the
garden.
Weil said all of the garden
activities are themed around the
butterfly life cycle.
"It's like a patient diagnosed
with cancer who thinks the
world is over," Weil said. "That
individual, whether they're a child
or adult, goes through a whole
metamorphosis. They come out on
the other side just as beautiful as
they were as when they went into
it."
Pointing to a boy holding a
monarch on his finger, Weil said,
"It's that kind of thing that's so
remarkable and amazing."
