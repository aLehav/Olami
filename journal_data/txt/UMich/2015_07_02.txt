Plaintiffs, residents 
celebrate victory

By LARA MOEHLMAN

As news that the Supreme 
Court ruled in favor of same-
sex marriage swept across the 
U.S. Friday morning, supporters 
rallied in both downtown Ann 
Arbor and Washington D.C. in 
celebration of this historic deci-
sion.

The 
Jim 
Toy 
Community 
Center, an advocacy group for 
gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgen-
der and queer residents of Ann 
Arbor, Ypsilanti and the greater 
Washtenaw County area, hosted 
a “Day of Decision Rally” so sup-
porters could gather in response 
to the Court’s decision.
After 
quieting 
the 
crowd, 
April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, 
one couple represented in the 
string of cases considered by the 
Court, offered remarks under 
rainbow colored streamers dur-

ing the press conference portion 
of the event. DeBoer thanked her 
lawyers for their determination 
and hard work.
In January 2012, Michigan 
residents 
April 
DeBoer 
and 
Jayne Rowse filed a lawsuit in 
the U.S. District Court, chal-
lenging Michigan’s ban on adop-
tion by same-sex couples.
DeBoer 
and 
Rowse 
sepa-
rately adopted one son and two 
daughters, respectively, but were 
unable to jointly adopt their 
children because Michigan law 

did not recognize same-sex mar-
riages, and only granted joint 
parent adoption rights to mar-
ried couples.
“It’s been a long, long, hard 
road,” Deboer said. “It’s been 
four and a half years in the mak-
ing… We would not be here if it 
weren’t for many people, and 
first and foremost our attorneys: 
Dana Nessel and Ken Mogill, Bob 
Sedler and Carole Stanyar. So I 
want to thank you guys as well.

Supreme Court’s 5-4 
decision champions 
equality

By ALYSSA BRANDON AND 
LARA MOEHLMAN 

Summer Managing News Editors 

The Supreme Court of the 
United States ruled in a 5-to-4 
decision that same-sex couples 

have a constitutional right to 
marriage.
Justice 
Anthony 
Kennedy 
delivered the long-awaited deci-
sion Friday morning.
“The Constitution promises 
liberty to all within its reach, a 
liberty that includes certain spe-
cific rights that allow persons, 
within a lawful realm, to define 
and express their identity. The 
petitioners in these cases seek 
to find that liberty by marry-

ing someone of the same sex and 
having their marriages deemed 
lawful on the same terms and 
conditions as marriages between 
persons of the opposite sex,” Ken-
nedy wrote in the decision.
In his remarks at the White 
House following the decision’s 
release, President Barack Obama 
said the Supreme Court’s ruling 
was not only a victory for the cou-
ples represented in the cases, but 
a victory for the U.S. as a whole.

“And this ruling is a victory for 
America,” he said. “This decision 
affirms what millions of Ameri-
cans already believe in their 
hearts. When all Americans are 
treated as equal, we are all more 
free.”
He also said the decision 
should encourage those who are 
still fighting for social change 
that change is possible.
“But today should also give 
us hope that on the many issues 

with which we grapple, often 
painfully, real change is possi-
ble.” he said. “Shift in hearts and 
minds is possible. And those who 
have come so far on their journey 
to equality have a responsibility 
to reach back and help others 
join them, because for all of our 
differences, we are one people, 
stronger together than we could 
ever be alone. That’s always been 
our story.”

Ann Arbor to 
Ferguson holds 
meet and greet

Activists hold 
meeting to discuss 
race-related issues 

By ALAINA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

Ann Arbor to Ferguson, a 
local activist group protest-
ing police brutality, held a 
Black Lives Matter communi-
ty meet and greet at Elks Pratt 
Lodge in Ann Arbor Saturday 
to encourage residents to talk 
about the issues black people 
in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti 
face today and to plan Black 
Lives Matter activism events.
Denise Bailey, one of the 
organizers of the group and a 
graduate student at the Uni-
versity, said there was a lot of 
local interest in gathering to 
take action for the lives and 
civil rights of African Ameri-
cans in Ann Arbor following 
the death of Aura Rosser.
Rosser, a 40-year old black 
woman and Ann Arbor resi-
dent, was fatally shot by an 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
officer after she reportedly 
approached officers with a 
knife. The Washtenaw Coun-
ty Prosecutor’s office did not 
press criminal charges against 
AAPD Officer David Ried, cit-
ing “lawful self-defense” in 
his shooting of Rosser. Ann 
Arbor to Ferguson was formed 
in response to Rosser’s death, 
protesting 
the 
Prosecutor’s 
decision and arguing that her 
death was preventable and 
one of a long history of police 
brutality and discrimination 
against African Americans.
Ann Arbor to Ferguson is a 
consensus-based group that 
meets every Friday and has 
around 25 members during 
the school year. The group 
contains people of a variety of 
viewpoints and has members 
working on different projects 
to combat racism against Afri-
can 
Americans. 
Previously, 
the group held a silent protest 
to raise awareness for police 
brutality against black women.

University 
graduate 
stu-
dent Austin McCoy, an Ann 
Arbor to Ferguson organizer, 
said the group is working with 
the City to form both a citizen 
review board for oversight of 
the AAPD and a policy of best 
practices for the department.
Organizer 
Shirley 
Beck-
ley spoke at the event, invit-
ing people to join her in 
“court-watching.” She specifi-
cally criticized the unequal 
law-enforcement 
she 
had 
seen, especially with regard 
to charging African-American 
children as adults.
“We do exist. We are here,” 
said Beckley. “We keep trying. 
We keep protesting. We keep 
asking, and I don’t know the 
solution. I’m a little tired of it. 
I’m a black woman who has a 
son and a grandson. I worry 
about their safety.”
Doctoral student Princess 
Williams, who worked for the 
political campaign of Jackson 
Mississippi’s former mayor, 
Chokwe Lumumba, a civil 
rights activist from Detroit, 
said she has seen first-hand 
the unequal treatment of Afri-
can Americans by the justice 
system. She said that although 
she values the north for its 
progressivism, she said racism 
still exists here, too.
“They’re going to be nice to 
you, but they’re not going to 
say they’re still thinking racist 
things,” Williams said. “I feel 
like something like Baltimore 
or Ferguson wouldn’t happen 
in Mississippi because we are 
hyper-conscious of the racism 
within that state, so if some-
thing happens, they’re going 
to immediately jump on the 
officials.”
She then spoke about the 
murder of James Craig Ander-
son in 2009 in Jackson, Mis-
sissippi by a group of white 
teenagers.
“When something like that 
happens, we take it seriously. 
Whereas, in the north, I feel 
like people have this percep-
tion that, ‘oh, that’s not racist’ 
or ‘there’s not a lot of politics

In dissenting opinion Justice John 
Roberts argued justices have the 
responsibility to determine what the 
law is, not what the law should be. This 
argument said states have the right 
to determine for themselves within 
those legislative bodies whether or not 
same-sex marriage is legal.
Key to Kennedy’s decision in favor 
of same-sex marriage was consider-
ation of the evolution of marriage, in 
addition to a recognition of its history.
“The 
centrality 
of 
marriage 
to the human condition makes it 
unsurprising that the institution 
has existed for millennia and across 
civilizations,” Kennedy wrote. “The 
petitioners acknowledge this his-
tory but contend that these cases 
cannot end there. Far from seeking 
to devalue marriage, the petition-
ers seek it for themselves because 
of their respect—and need—for its 
privileges and responsibilities. And 
their immutable nature dictates that 
same-sex marriage is their only real 
path to this profound commitment.”
Outside the courthouse, onlook-
ers erupted with cheers when the 
decision was released.
Following 
their 
excitement, 
there was a moment of silence until 
shortly thereafter the Washington 
D.C. Gay Men’s choir, standing in 
the back, began to sing a verse of the 
Star Spangled Banner. “USA” chants 
started filling the crowd.
That festive atmosphere remained 
at the Court for the hours after the 
decision, with hundreds of people 
still gathered two hours after the 
decision was announced, waving 
flags and breaking out into sponta-
neous cheers, as the men’s choir kept 
singing intermittently.
Stu Maddux, a resident of San 
Francisco California, was one of 

many people gathered outside the 
Court Friday morning. He and oth-
ers in attendance traveled long dis-
tances across the nation to witness 
this historic decision.
“We came in from California just 
to be here for this,” Maddux said. 
“We cried. We got married when 
Prop 8 was repealed, but to be out 
here for this, it feels even more 
affirming. It really can’t be taken 
away now.”
John Michael Eclar, a D.C. resi-
dent, said achieving marriage equal-
ity and gaining large amounts of 
support was unimaginable, charac-
terizing the event as surreal.
“Marriage equality across the 
nation is a thing I didn’t think I 
would see in my lifetime. Growing 
up in Virginia, where I was this...
really insecure awkward person 
where in my upbringing I thought 
that being gay was a sin and it was 
something that I couldn’t accept 
personally,” Eclar said. “And as I was 
growing up, and the way the country 
was evolving, it was just amazing to 
see how supportive everybody start-
ed to become.”
Justin Quam, also a D.C. resi-
dent, said he too was in awe of the 
Court’s ruling.
“I’m just amazed that we’re here 
to see it,” Quam said. “I remember a 
couple of years ago, I made a bet with 
my brother of when marriage equal-
ity would be the law of the land, and 
I bet him it would be before 2020. 
And even at the time, I thought I was 
going to lose that bet for sure.”
Joe Goldma, a D.C. resident, said 
having moved to D.C. from Texas, he 
feels relieved to be able to celebrate 
and enjoy a sense of community he 
never experienced before. Goldma, 
who was dressed up as U.S. Supreme 
Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 
said he chose the outfit in honor of 
Ginsburg’s perseverance.
“Ruth Bader Ginsburg had to 

overcome a lot of obstacles to get 
where she is, whether it was in her 
advocacy, as an advocate lawyer and 
of course as a judge,” Goldma said. 
“And for me it’s sort of inspiration, 
to continue to push and break those 
glass ceilings, to be the person that I 
want to be.”
Conor Rogers, a D.C. resident 
who went to the Court to hear the 
decision with his partner, said the 
Court’s ruling is one that will go 
down in history.
“This is the kind of thing that 
your kids will read in textbooks, and 
they’ll be like, where were you when 
it happened?” Rogers said. “And so 
to be literally here is kind of amaz-
ing.If you went back in time and told 
me when I was fifteen years old, I’d 
be surprised,” Rogers said. “But I 
think as time went on, I think people 
knew this was inevitable, whether it 

was by the Court or by the vote.”
Al Gerhardstein, attorney for lead 
plaintiff Jim Obergefell, also par-
ticipated in celebrations outside the 
court. He said the court’s decision 
carried much emotional weight.
“It’s all very exciting, and it’s also 
very personal...in the bar section 
in the courtroom I was listening to 
all these otherwise jaded lawyers 
weep,” he said. “And I’m among it. I 
mean, it’s that profound that you can 
do nothing other than emote, when 
you realise what’s going on.”
Gerhardstein said though there 
may be more complications to face 
in the future, today was a victory 
worth celebrating.
“I don’t know how that’ll fare,” he 
said. “I haven’t even read the deci-
sion yet, so I don’t know where the 
loopholes are, that they’re going to 
be hunting for. So that’s tomorrow. 

Today is champagne.”
Justices were considering sev-
eral cases that challenged same-sex 
marriage bans in Kentucky, Ohio, 
Tennessee and Michigan, which 
were consolidated under the name 
Obergefell v. Hodges. Opening argu-
ments for the case began in April.
Michigan’s case, DeBoer v. Sny-
der, began in January 2012 when 
Michigan residents April DeBoer 
and Jayne Rowse filed a lawsuit in 
the U.S. District Court, challeng-
ing Michigan’s ban on adoption by 
same-sex couples.
DeBoer and Rowse separately 
adopted one son and two daugh-
ters, respectively, but were unable to 
jointly adopt their children because 
Michigan does not recognize same-

Debbie Dingell holds long-term care dialogue 

Talk sets the stage 
for upcoming White 
House conference

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Summer Managing News Editor

Congresswoman Debbie Ding-
ell (MI–12) met with a group of 
senior citizens Monday morning 
at the Pittsfield Township Senior 
Center to facilitate a dialogue on 
the long-term care system in the 
U.S.

The discussion was one of sev-
eral hosted by Dingell before the 
upcoming White House Confer-
ence on Aging held in Washington 
D.C. in July.
Monday’s 
discussion, 
which 
garnered a packed crowd at the 
Senior Center, was particularly 
relevant following the Supreme 
Court’s recent decision to uphold 
the Affordable Care Act, which 
Dingell said does not address the 
issue of long-term care.
“I’m very glad last week that the 
Supreme Court ruled the way they 
did on the Affordable Care Act,” 

Dingell said during the discussion. 
“It’s not a perfect bill– we can keep 
working to get it fixed, but the fact 
of the matter is, is that it does not 
do very much for long-term care or 
do anything for seniors, and we’ve 
got to keep working on that.”
The Dingell family has been 
involved in health care reform 
throughout 
history. 
Dingell’s 
husband, John Dingell, was an 
original author of the Affordable 
Care Act, which President Obama 
signed into law in 2010. John 
Dingell’s father, the late John 
Dingell Sr., also introduced a bill 

in congress to provide national 
health insurance every year he 
was in the House until his passing 
in 1955.
Dingell herself introduced the 
Medicare Hearing Aid Coverage 
Act of 2015 and has also released 
a Long-term Care Guidebook, 
which provides resources for resi-
dents of Southeast Michigan deal-
ing with long-term health issues.
Dingell said the current long-
term care system in Michigan is 
a maze of unintegrated systems 
that are difficult to navigate and 
that are not designed to be helpful. 

She also said she is particularly 
focused on long-term care reform 
because it is an issue she is cur-
rently dealing with herself, citing 
her husband’s recent health issues.
“I say to everybody I’m on a 
journey myself,” she said. “It’s 
been a rough year. I’m not gonna 
lie to you, and it’s one of the rea-
sons that I’m really focused on 
these issues– because I’ve been 
living a lot of these issues myself,” 
said Dingell.
Dingell also stressed her disap-
pointment with Medicare’s failure

OPINION

Over the past decade, the 

movement for marriage equal-
ity has undeniably possessed 
immense 
momentum. 
Pre-

viously, 
same-sex 
marriage 

was legal in 37 states and the 
District of Columbia, but the 
ruling finally ensures that all 
government proceedings reflect 
the vast amount of support for 
same-sex marriage across the 
country. According to a recent 
poll by the Pew Research Cen-
ter, 57 percent of Americans are 
in favor of same-sex marriage. 

The Court’s actions end a 

decades-long debate that has 
slowly inched toward altering 
the definition of marriage under 
the law. Most recently, two 
years ago, the Court declared 
aspects of the discriminatory 
Defense of Marriage Act to be 
unconstitutional. 
The 
com-

plete legalization of same-sex 

marriage nationwide was the 
next logical and inevitable 
step to ensure equality for the 
LGBTQ community. As both 
past and present actions illus-
trate, it’s integral to the opera-
tion of any government to 
realize the malleability of cul-
tural values and to adjust our 
laws accordingly as we, as a 
 

society, progress.

In the majority opinion, 

Justice 
Anthony 
Kennedy 

described exactly why adjust-
ment was needed: “As some of 
the petitioners in these cases 
demonstrate, marriage embod-
ies a love that may endure even 
past death. It would misunder-
stand these men and women 
to say they disrespect the idea 
of marriage. Their plea is that 
they do respect it, respect it so 
deeply that they seek to find 
its fulfillment for themselves. 

Their hope is not to be con-
demned to live in loneliness, 
excluded from one of civiliza-
tion’s oldest institutions. They 
ask for equal dignity in the eyes 
of the law. The Constitution 
grants them that right.” 

Finally, after denying these 

individuals their liberty for 
far too long, the Court’s ruling 
ensures each marriage will be 
upheld and recognized accord-
ing to the same standards. The 
decision paves the way for 
equality not only in the realm 
of marriage and civil unions, 
but it additionally guarantees 
accompanying 
benefits 
and 

rights in a variety of areas, such 
as adoption, health care and 
financial matters. 

All that said, last Friday’s 

historic decision serves as a 
reminder of all the progress 
that has yet to be attained. But 

People being people

certainly, the judgment in Obergefell 
v. Hodges will aid in successfully com-
bating legalized discrimination that 
continues to exist in numerous states, 

including Michigan. For now, though, 
Friday’s ruling is a moment to celebrate 
and a testament to the will of a nation to 
enact necessary social change.

FROM THE DAILY

It’s about time
 SCOTUS declares constitutionality of same-sex marriages
L

ast Friday morning, after months of deliberation, the Supreme 
Court voted 5-4 to legalize same-sex marriage across the country. 
Citing equal protection under the 14th amendment, this ruling 

also requires all states to recognize any same-sex marriage performed 
in another state. The Obergefell v. Hodges case provided a long-await-
ed resolution to tenuous legal battles brought forth by a consolidation 
of several cases — one of which was DeBoer v. Snyder, a case challeng-
ing Michigan’s same-sex marriage ban, which subsequently prohibited 
same-sex couples from jointly adopting children. This momentous but 
severely overdue ruling by the Court merely marks the beginning of 
striking down unjust legal barriers and taking steps to dissolve immense 
discrimination faced by the LGBTQ community. But by recognizing the 
diverse range of couples and families, last Friday’s decision sets forth a 

crucial historical precedent to ensure full equality for all.

E

ach generation is defined by 
its monumental occasions. For 
ours, last Friday was undoubt-

edly one of those 
days. The Supreme 
Court ruling — in 
years to come — 
will stand as a piv-
otal 
moment 
of 

progress that was 
long 
anticipated 

and 
was 
widely 

celebrated by those 
close to me.

Delayed for far 

too long, marriage 
equality was a necessary cultural shift 
that didn’t come quietly — nor should 
it have. Within a mere matter of hours 
after the decision was first announced 
— and certainly by the next day — the 
divisive nature of the issue was splayed 
on computer screens across the coun-
try. Amidst a stream of rainbow-tinted 
profile pictures, news articles and jubi-
lant announcements, there were only 
a few posts on my personal newsfeed 
that didn’t share the same excitement. 
While a select number of posts prompt-
ed some lengthy debates, the few that 
argued a differing set of beliefs tried to 
do so respectfully.

However, during a phone a conversa-

tion a few days later, I learned that my 
newsfeed had probably been slightly 
more colorful and more enthusiastic 
than those belonging to members of 
my family or to some of my friends in 
other parts of the country. Not yet real-
izing that I probably had been encapsu-
lated in a progressive, millennial media 
bubble, I grew increasingly aggravated 
and passionate as I was told some of 
the opposing points raised against the 
decision. A family member — detecting 
my not-so-subtle annoyance — told me 
important words to remember when-
ever I was talking about this particular 
case. They parted the conversation with 
the phrase: “Let people be people.”

“Let people be people?” I was so con-

fused. What else would they even be?

This phrase – although I still didn’t 

get it— kept resurfacing in my mind and 
appearing on the page as I scrawled 
down scrambled words, passages and 
column ideas. The more I pondered 
the seemingly vague and obvious state-
ment, the more applicable it seemed.

People disagree. People argue. Peo-

ple hold a varying degree of beliefs that 
will inevitably clash, but even so, the 
dissonance between conflicting ide-

ologies needs to be addressed without 
judging, or denouncing, the other per-
son or endangering their rights. Ideally, 
this was probably the intended meaning 
of the message when I first received it, 
but I delved a bit further.

In a way, the statement — albeit a 

rudimentary one — summarizes the 
Supreme Court ruling as whole. As 
humans, we all seek to love, to find con-
tentment and to enjoy the environment 
and the people we surround ourselves 
with.The goal of the Court ruling was 
to let people be themselves and love 
freely without discrimination. The suc-
cess of Friday’s milestone demonstrates 
humanity’s capability to persevere and 
devote itself to a cause.

While the government may have 

guaranteed individuals this right, the 
next actions need to involve ensuring 
the security and comfort they rightfully 
deserve as they do so. Despite the wide-
spread acceptance and support exhibited 
for the goals of the LGBTQ community, 
expressing one’s identity fully isn’t done 
without precautions. Members of the 
LGBTQ community continue to face 
immense rates of violence and harass-
ment. The freedom to marry and settle 
down may extend across the nation, but 
financial and career stability isn’t guar-
anteed in each state. Protections pro-
hibiting workplace discrimination based 
upon sexual orientation exist only in 22 
states, and only 19 of these states possess 
statutes guarding against discrimination 
based upon gender identity. Additionally, 
increased rates of poverty and homeless-
ness still need to be addressed.

People — while they may strive for 

security and companionship — also 
tend to fear the upheaval of tradition. 
Recent attempts to nullify or combat 
the Court’s ruling, as suggested by 
a group of government officials and 
presidential candidates, only demon-
strate an unwillingness to improve 
the greater good in an attempt to 
calm this trepidation.

Let people be people. It’s a simple 

statement, and it most likely lacks 
some needed nuance. Yet, at its core, it 
describes a basic principle for how we 
should act towards one another. As a 
society, our goal, despite differences of 
opinion, should be to promote the idea 
that each person is free to express their 
identity as authentically as possible 
without outside inhibitors or judgment.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com OPINION

The University of Michigan 

and Michigan State University, 
the two largest universities in 
the state, together purchase 
more than $2 billion of goods 
and services each year, includ-
ing 
everything 
from 
desks 

to 
high-powered 
computers. 

Much of this money is spent 
in Michigan, supporting local 
businesses, even through tough 
economic times. Unfortunately, 
state policies have prevented 
the University and MSU from 
fully using their purchasing 
power for the benefit of all of 
Michigan’s business owners.

According to the most recent 

census, only 30 percent of Michi-
gan firms are owned by women 
and 13 percent by minorities. 
One of the major causes of this is 
an unfair lack of access to capi-
tal: women and minority entre-
preneurs are less likely to have 
loans approved and more likely 
to pay higher interest rates, even 
after controlling for credit score 
and other factors. This lack of 
entrepreneurship opportunities 
hurts job growth and drives both 
wealth and income inequality.

Many universities around 

the country have recognized 
similar 
conditions 
in 
their 

communities and used their 
purchasing power to help give 
a fair shot to all entrepreneurs. 
For example, by focusing on 
local suppliers and increasing 
its purchases from minority-
owned firms from $41.4 million 
to $105.7 million, the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania has gen-
erated about 200 jobs and $6 
million in local wages. Region-
ally similar schools like Ohio 
State University, the University 
of Illinois, Indiana University 
and the University of Wiscon-
sin have all set specific spend-
ing goals for businesses with 
women and minority owners.

However, two current state poli-

cies inhibit Michigan’s universities 
from making a similar impact.

In 2006, a state constitu-

tional amendment was passed 
banning affirmative action by 
publicly 
funded 
institutions. 

While much has been written 

about how the ban has affected 
minority enrollment in higher 
education, there has been far 
less discussion about how the 
ban has affected university pro-
curement departments. Point 2 
of Section 26 of the amendment 
states that “the state shall not 
discriminate against, or grant 
preferential treatment to, any 
individual or group on the basis 
of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or 
national origin in the operation 
of public employment, public 
education, or public contracting 
(emphasis ours).”

Because of this specific ban on 

affirmative action in public con-
tracting, universities in Michi-
gan are unable to systematically 
support disadvantaged business 
owners through their procure-
ment. This prevents both the 
University and Michigan State 
University from setting specific 
disadvantaged business spend-
ing goals, like many universities 
in the Midwest.

Additionally, 
unlike 
many 

states — both red and blue — 
there’s no comprehensive state-
wide agency that’s set up to 
support or certify women- and 
minority-owned 
businesses 

(WBEs and MBEs, respectively). 
While the Michigan Department 
of Transportation maintains a 
small 
transportation-specific 

database (as mandated by federal 
law) and the nonprofit Michigan 
Minority Supplier Development 
Council maintains an MBE certi-
fication, both of these programs 
include only incomplete listings 
that are not publicly searchable.

As a result, neither public 

nor private institutions have an 
available list of such businesses. 
So even if MSU, the Univer-
sity or another local enterprise 
believe they might be able to 
use a WBE or MBE for a spe-
cific contract, they have to rely 
on a variety of private groups 
for information. (MSU once 
maintained its own diverse ven-
dor database, but it was lost in 
a software switch and is only 
slowly being reconstructed.)

While other states’ diverse 

business programs vary, Michi-

gan’s lack of an agency or pub-
lic database is unusual. Every 
state that surrounds it in the 
Midwest, including Ohio, Indi-
ana, Illinois and Wisconsin, 
maintains a searchable data-
base. Some states, like Ohio, 
actually set benchmarks for 
state agency procurement.

There’s nothing partisan or 

left-leaning about these other 
states’ MBE and WBE programs. 
Alabama’s 
Republican-domi-

nated state government not only 
certifies 
businesses 
through 

its Office of Minority Business 
Enterprises, but also advocates 
for and offers training to small 
and diverse businesses. South 
Carolina’s Republican governor, 
Nikki Haley, maintains a Gover-
nor’s Office of Small and Minor-
ity Business Assistance. This 
office has established a data-
base of diverse vendors, works 
with state agencies to moni-
tor minority contracting, and 
offers policy guidance on issues 
involving small and minority-
owned businesses.

These states have recognized 

that creating entrepreneurship 
opportunities for all of their 
citizens creates jobs and com-
bats inequality in their commu-
nities. It’s time for Michigan to 
do the same.

Michigan’s legislators must 

support universities’ efforts to 
purchase from disadvantaged 
businesses throughout the state. 
A repeal of the state’s contro-
versial constitutional amend-
ment banning affirmative action 
would create lasting change, but 
is currently unlikely. Right now, 
however, our legislators and 
governor can work to establish 
an office that creates a data-
base of diverse firms. Doing so 
would allow Michigan universi-
ties to join with others around 
the country in creating more 
vibrant, inclusive communities.

ROOSEVELT INSTITUTE | VIEWPOINT

I 

went to the movies with a 
couple of friends on Satur-
day to see Pixar’s “Inside 

Out.” 
Having 

seen the trailer 
and 
thinking, 

“Wow! 
Who-

ever thought of 
this must have 
been on drugs,” 
I knew this was 
a movie I had 
to see (even if it 
meant being the 
only 
group 
of 

college students 
mixed in with 
parents and their 
pre-10-year-old kids fighting for the 
coveted middle seats that aren’t too 
high up).

After winning the battle against 

my tendency to fall asleep during 
movies, when the film ended, I knew 
I had seen something special. Sure, 
it was technically a “kids” movie 
because that’s what Pixar makes, 
but really it was anything but. It was 
a movie that I, a 21-year-old rising 
college senior, needed to see.

Without ruining it for anyone, 

the message of the movie is this: It’s 
okay to be sad.

Yes, it’s certainly more pleasant to 

be happy, but there are times where 
we need help to cope with what’s 
going on in our lives. And instead of 
pretending to be something we’re 
not and repressing our emotions, it’s 
simply better for our mental health 
to be honest and express our sadness 
(or anger, fear and disgust, though at 
least according to the movie, these 
emotions are less productive in 
helping ourselves).

For the most part, the people 

closest to me — my friends and fam-
ily — believe in this. We’re open 
with each other and tell it how it 
is. When we’re happy, upset, sad 
or frustrated, we make it known. 
Admittedly, this can sometimes 
go to the point of offending each 
other or just being annoying, but 
I wouldn’t have it any other way. 
“Inside Out” validated this lifestyle 
for me.

Over the past couple of years, 

I’ve come to terms with the idea 
that being “happy” isn’t my ulti-
mate goal. Because if it is, then 
I’m most certainly going to fail. 
Emotions come and go, so even in 
the best possible circumstances, 
feelings of joy are only temporary. 
Therefore, the goal is letting the 
negative emotions, like sadness and 
fear, happen, but not allowing them 
to latch on for too long and become 

overwhelming to the point of 
depression. Obviously, that’s easier 
said than done.

By no means is this philosophy my 

idea. I first came across it when my 
aunt recommended that I read “The 
Happiness Trap” by Dr. Russ Harris. 
Put simply, Dr. Harris presents the 
idea that most thoughts are random 
and uncontrollable. Therefore, it’s 
not worth trying to control what you 
think, but rather how much weight 
you put on each thought. In order to 
determine which thoughts are more 
important than others, you decide if 
they apply to your beliefs and values, 
the things we care about the most. If 
they do, you act on it. If not, instead 
of trying to actively eliminate the 
thought and getting upset that it 
exists, you let it wither away. Doing 
this successfully takes immense 
practice — it’s a daily challenge for 
me — but I am convinced it will help 
me live the life I want to live.

In my Public Health 300 course 

this past winter, Prof. Vic Strech-
er taught something similar. He 
preached the idea of living with pur-
pose, that when you live for some-
thing above yourself, whatever that 
may be, you will live not only a fulfill-
ing life, but a healthier life. To name a 
few benefits, studies have shown that 
having a purpose can help us sleep 
better and reduce obesity, as well the 
risk of a heart attack. So although I 
am still searching for my purpose 
(it’s not supposed to be easy), this 
concept has stuck with me.

The issue with these ideas is that 

they’re relatively new. There is a 
massive emphasis in this country on 
the “pursuit of happiness,” and right-
fully so. After all, we’ve been talking 
about it for nearly 239 years.

But perhaps we should take on a 

different approach, where we stop 
tricking people into believing that 
a happy life is a successful life. Per-
haps a life where we learn to balance 
our emotions and embrace the good 
and the bad is really what makes a 
successful life, that is, if we’re deter-
mined to define success. Maybe it’s 
time to start preaching, “life, liberty 
and the pursuit of purpose.”

“Inside Out” continued a needed 

conversation on the importance of 
mental health and how our society 
handles it. But it’s up to us to keep 
talking and educating ourselves — to 
change the outdated status quo.

And by the way, how cool would it 

be if there were actually little crea-
tures in our heads?

The pursuit of purpose


Kendrick Lamar thanks 
Lil B, and here is why

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

How the underground 
artist has transformed 
rap music’s landscape

By SHAYAN SHAFII

For The Daily

Kendrick Lamar almost never 

tweets. When he does, it usually 
has something to do with either 
his music or one of his TDE label-
mates. But this week, he gave a 
completely 
unprompted 
shou-

tout to Bay Area rapper Lil B on 
twitter. The phrase “Thank you 
BasedGod” appeared not once, 
but twice in the less than 140 
characters tweet, where Ken-
drick showered Lil B and Lil 
Wayne with praise. The tweet 
leaves many conservative hip hop 
heads with mixed feelings: why 
is the creator of To Pimp a But-
terfly showing love for the dude 
with songs titled “Pretty Bitch” 
and “What Dat Mouth Do?” 
According to Kendrick himself, 
for “teaching us how to swagg in 
videos”. And he’s right. Under-
ground rap before Lil B looked 
like shit. Back in 2009, popular 
mixtape-hosting 
website 
Dat-

piff was cluttered with backpack 
rappers who oddly competed for 
the worst Nas impersonation. 
The advent of Lil B, although met 
with strong resistance, forced cli-
ché mixtape rappers to reconcile 
with the fact that rap was chang-
ing. Looking back from 2015, the 
current hip hop climate has been 
largely built by an unsung hero in 
the form of a guy with dirty vans 
and zero radio hits.

Before even getting into the 

music, it’s important to trace the 
evolution of visuals in rap music 
over the past six years. Lil B has 
been on twitter since 2009, and 
he’s had the same avatar since. It’s 
a photo of him wearing a multicol-
or silk coat with no shirt under-
neath; he gives a faint smile while 
flexing his iced out ring and now 
iconic tats. Virtually every quirky, 
bizarre Internet rapper that’s 
come out since has been nothing 
but an attempt to recreate that 
photo in life and song. All you have 
to do is watch a Migos video, a Riff 
Raff vine or any photo of Young 

Thug fully clothed. B has also 
been wearing gender-breaking fits 
from the start, but no one made a 
fuss of rappers wearing women’s 
clothes until Kanye West wore a 
women’s Céline shirt during his 
2011 Coachella performance, or a 
skirt (kilt?) during his Watch The 
Throne tour the same year. Based-
God had quietly been curating 
these developments in rap years 
earlier. Furthermore, the only 
time Lil B has had the nation’s 
attention was last week when he 
appeared on ESPN’s SportsNation, 
donning earrings, a sun hat and a 
white lace top. 

And then there are the videos. 

Earlier in the summer, A$AP 
Rocky dropped his drugged out 
visuals for L$D, but guess who 
premiered it on his behalf? Pay-
ing homage, Rakim got Lil B to 
premier the video by being the 
first to tweet the link. The video 
itself, with Rocky roaming the 
streets in exaggerated colors and 
warped depth can draw direct 
comparisons to many of Lil B’s 
earlier videos, but it’s not the 
first time Rocky’s art could be 
described as based. Rocky (and 
subsequently the rest of the 
A$AP Mob) blew up after the 
2011 release of Live.Love.A$AP, 
which Clams Casino (prominent 
Lil B collaborator) produced a 
third of. One of the foremost 
identifying features of Rocky 
on this tape is his perception of 
himself: a self-described “pretty 
boy” who signed a three million-
dollar deal off Internet buzz. 

Naturally, this poses questions 

that are difficult to answer. Why 
do so many artists get away with 
based tendencies while catching 
mainstream success? Why is Lil 
B celebrated only ironically while 
the artists that spawned in his 
wake climb the Billboard charts? 
Why do people hate Lil B while 
their favorite rappers adore him? 
We know the answer isn’t behav-
ioral, because so many of his fledg-
lings exhibit the same behavior 
while gaining widespread respect. 
Thus, the answer lies somewhere 
in his rugged, sprawling, unpol-
ished discography.

The problem with Lil B is 

accessibility. His Wikipedia page 
lists 58 different mixtapes, solo 

albums and collaborative efforts, 
but that doesn’t even begin to 
scrape the surface. The reality 
is he has hundreds of projects 
floating around the Internet, 
some boasting over 100 songs. I 
routinely download 5 mixtapes 
at a time and don’t discover hid-
den gems until months later. For 
fans, the act of following his 
music is almost as fun as listen-
ing. The excitement of keeping 
up with Lil B’s output is part of 
what creates his cult fan base; 
there’s a new music video every 
week, a new song every day, and 
a new tweet every hour. This is 
ultimately what distinguishes 
him from the likes of A$AP 
Rocky 
and 
ILoveMakonnen: 

there are barriers to entry. You 
can’t just YouTube him and settle 
on knowing Wonton Soup. He has 
so much content on the Internet, 
that he makes you work to be a 
truly informed fan. There’s no 
such thing as a lazy Lil B fan.

The man has a ridiculous 

work ethic, but his downfall in 
achieving mainstream success 
is that he does not entertain the 
notion of quality control (which 
is not a bad thing artistically). 
He doesn’t even stop and fix a 
song if he messes up recording. 
There are countless instances of 
Lil B losing his place, or outright 
bringing his rapping to halt mid-
track to collect his thoughts. But 
if Lil B had a leaner discography, 
he still wouldn’t have become a 
relevant figure in mainstream 
rap. The nature of his influence 
on modern rap is in his relentless 
output and all the crazy shit that 
comes with it: the inspiration to 
be yourself, coming from a dude 
who thinks he’s Ellen Degeneres, 
Miley Cyrus and Jesus Christ at 
the same time. Sadly, this was 
the only way it could have hap-
pened. The man who fathers 
most of the rappers and trends in 
the game, is inherently unable to 
enjoy the same mainstream suc-
cess as his successors. While Lil 
B remains a villain in conserva-
tive circles of hip hop culture 
and an enigma to casual rap fans, 
those who can accept the shift-
ing face of rap truly appreciate 
what he’s done for the culture. 
Thank you BasedGod.

‘Human,’ maybe

TV REVIEW

By KIM BATCHELOR

Daily Arts Writer

The British-American science-

fiction series, “Humans,” follows 
a group of artificially intelligent 
robots 
called 

Synths 
who 

are 
different 

from the other 
Synths who are 
manufactured 
and sold com-
mercially. These 
Synths are spe-
cial because they have the ability 
to think on their own and to feel.

The episode is a bit of a slow 

burn, focusing on the intro-
duction of the world in which 
Synths exist and the characters 
rather than action. The dialogue 
is important, though, and if the 
audience has difficulty under-
standing English accents one 
ought to consider closed captions. 
The interpersonal interactions 
are what drive the show.

The main protagonist, Anita 

(Gemma Chan, “Secret Diary of a 
Call Girl”), is a member of a special 
group of Synths who have been 
kidnapped and reprogrammed. 
She is struggling with resurgent 
memories 
and 
emotions 
dur-

ing her assignment to a family. 
Gemma plays the role with dig-
nity and poise, making her perfor-
mance believable. Despite this, she 
invokes an emotional response in 
the viewer as we sympathize with 
Anita’s plight.

Colin Morgan (“The Fall”) 

plays a Synth supporter named 
Leo who travels with and protects 
the group of Synths as his fam-
ily. In fact, it was his father who 
created these Synths. His char-
acter is hard to get a read on as 
Leo plays everything close to his 
chest. This is a self-preservation 
technique, but as a result it is diffi-
cult to figure out what his motiva-
tions are as a character and access 
him emotionally. He comes off as 
stand-offish and vaguely threat-
ening. Hopefully, more backstory 
will be given on why these Synths 
are different, how they are related 
to Leo and why they are on the 
run in the first place.

The family dynamic built by 

the Hawkins family, consisting 
of Joe (Tom Goodman-Hill, “Mr. 
Selfridge”), Laura (Katherine Par-
kinson, “The IT Crowd”) and their 
three kids is humble and believ-

able. Because of the subtlety with 
which these actors perform, the 
dialogue between the parents 
and their kids isn’t forced. This 
is particularly true for Lucy Car-
less (“Code of a Killer”) in her 
portrayal of teenage Mattie. Mat-
tie is a brilliant hacker with a bad 
attitude towards Synths. Despite 
her typical teen angst she actually 
really loves her family and it’s her 
character that forms the glue that 
bonds the Hawkins together. Also, 
Sophie (Pixie Davies, “Utopia”) is 
incredibly adorable.

The father and son relation-

ship 
built 
between 
George 

Millican (William Hurt, “Dam-
ages”) and his Synth, Odi (Will 
Tudor, “Game of Thrones”) is 
heartbreaking. George relies on 
Odi’s memories of his deceased 
wife, Mary, because he can-
not remember her himself, but 
Odi is getting older and begin-
ning to breakdown. Despite 
Odi’s inability to connect with 
George on an emotional level, 
the viewer can’t help but root 
for the pair to stay together. To 
lose Odi would be, for George, 
to lose the rest of his family.

A stand out performance comes 

from Emily Berrington (“24: 
Live Another Day”) in the role 
of Niska, a Synth who was stolen 
along with Anita and forced into 
the role of Sex Worker. Despite 
the fact that it must be both physi-
cally and emotionally painful for 
her, Niska refuses to turn off her 
pain receptors, stating, “I was 
meant to feel.” And as she feels 
pain, so does the audience.

“Humans” has many referenc-

es to classical AI/Robot theory 
and literature, sighting the Three 
Laws of Robotics by Issac Asimov, 
which prevent a robot from harm-
ing a human, and the Technologi-
cal Singularity, in which AI is 
capable of recursive self-improve-
ment and humanity is made obso-
lete. Beyond this it also brings up 
moral and ethical philosophical 
debates to consider. For example, 
already in our own world robot 
girls are being created in Japan, 
are sexbots in our future too? And 
at what point would a robot be 
considered conscious enough for 
such an act to be considered rape, 
as it surely was to the character 
Niska? What is consciousness? 
What is a human and who has 
rights? What makes us different 
from machine?

BOOK REVIEW

“50 Shades” follow-up 
highlights abuse and 

ridiculousness

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

In August 2008, Stephenie Meyer 

broke the hearts of a million pre-
teen girls. Some jerk leaked the first 
12 chapters of “Midnight Sun,” her 
highly anticipated follow-up to the 
“Twilight” series, and this betrayal 
squashed her creative muse so thor-
oughly that she swore she’d never 
finish writing the book. The news 
broke my suggestible, Cullen-loving, 
14-year-old heart. I’d wanted more 
than anything to relive my favorite 
romance from another point of view 
— to dive into Edward’s brain and 
excavate his thoughts and blossom-
ing feelings for Bella and resurface 
with a complete history of their love.

The “Fifty Shades” film took 

me by surprise earlier this year, 
needling its way into my subcon-
scious. Despite its problematic 
relationship politics and Chris-
tian’s poor characterization, I fell 
as fast for these two as I did for 
Edward and Bella seven years ago. 
Lucky for fans of “Fifty Shades of 
Grey,” E.L. James is not Stephe-
nie Meyer. A few weeks before its 
June 18 publishing date, James 
announced that she’d rewritten 
“Fifty Shades” from Christian’s 
perspective. “Grey” would be 
a welcome surprise — after all, 
it’d been three whole years since 
James wrote the last installment 
of her trilogy, and media hype 
had quieted significantly. The 
coming sleepy afternoons of mid-
June would be the perfect time to 
awaken my inner goddess and take 
a trip into Christian Grey’s fifty-
shades-of-fucked-up head.

“Grey” does not deserve those 

summer afternoons. “Grey” does not 
deserve to occupy a single second of 
your time. “Grey” certainly does not 
deserve 559 pages of paper from thou-
sands of beautiful trees and $9.89 of 
your hard-earned money. This book is 
trash in its purest form, nearly impos-
sible to read through layers of stinking 
bullshit and lazy writing that makes 
the original “Fifty Shades” look like 
“Pride and Prejudice.”

Part of the appeal of reading this 

story from Ana’s perspective is that 
the reader could also get swept up 
in the mysterious allure of Christian 

Grey. The reader knows what Ana 
knows and sees what Ana sees — a 
gorgeous and super-rich guy who 
wanted to have lots of hot, weird 
sex. “Grey” features the exact same 
story and dialogue as “Fifty Shades,” 
which is not surprising given that 
this is a rewrite of a book that already 
exists. But just in case anyone want-
ed to call out Ms. James for putting 
approximately zero work into writ-
ing “Grey,” she adds an additional 
layer to the story. Christian Grey is a 
complete fucking psychopath.

Reading from his point of view is 

uncomfortable, to say the least. In 
the time spent away from Anastasia’s 
hula-dancing subconscious, we see 
that Christian daydreams of abusing 
women he’s barely talked to, has lit-
tle regard for consent and is obsessed 
with smelling Anastasia Steele’s 
neck. Christian objectifies Ana from 
the moment she arrives in his office 
to conduct that fateful school news-
paper interview. He fantasizes about 
her “inviting” mouth, the blush on 
her cheeks, her sweet blue eyes and 
“fine ass.” There’s nothing roman-
tic about deconstructing a woman’s 
appearance, and it’s amazing that 
James assumes that women will 
read this passage and still think of 
Christian as a flawed, but ultimately 
romantic, hero.

James tries to justify Christian’s 

behavior by providing his backstory. 
He’s scarred by the memory of his 
drug-addicted mother, who spent 
half her time neglecting Christian 
and the other half unconscious, and 
her abusive boyfriend. He has recur-
ring nightmares of being a four-year-
old boy in Detroit, sitting on the floor, 
pushing his toy cars around and hid-
ing from the scary man who hits his 
mother right in front of him. The ter-
rors quiet when he sleeps beside Ana, 
but still he refuses to indulge her 
idealistic “hearts and flowers” vision 
of love. Christian rebuffs her every 
time she asks to touch him (as he 
repeats about once every other page, 
he “cannot bear to be touched”) and 
whines when she wants to make love 
on a bed instead of in his playroom. 
Ana looks silly through Christian’s 
perspective. She just doesn’t get that 
he’s got this sob-story childhood 
and that the BDSM lifestyle saved 
his life. She’s a “frustrating woman” 
for not understanding that Christian 
just isn’t hard-wired for the kind of 
affection she’s looking for. While 
Christian claims to appreciate Ana’s 
stubborn personality and insists that 
she is in control of their relationship, 

Christian constantly undermines 
her decisions and actively stalks her 
until she changes her mind.

All this would be more tolerable 

if the book weren’t so damn boring. 
From the writer who brought you 
50 pages of e-mail correspondence, 
this is … 50 more pages of the exact 
same e-mail correspondence. Yes, 
the countless passages outlining 
the e-flirting and e-stalking that 
every reader loved in “Fifty Shades 
of Grey” make a reappearance here, 
and you might as well skip that half 
the book, because they are still dull 
as hell and make no sense. You would 
think that the CEO of a multi-million 
dollar corporation would have the 
common sense to text his main piece 
to ask where she is instead of pester 
her with dozens of e-mails every day.

And there is plenty of boring new 

material as well. Because Christian 
is the CEO of a multi-million dollar 
corporation, his days mostly con-
sist of e-mailing business execu-
tives and making vague plans for 
construction. There is an entire 
subplot about Christian decid-
ing whether to build in Detroit 
or Savannah, and it is completely 
pointless. He sometimes orders his 
coffee black, and sometimes a latte 
and it’s always an exciting buildup 
to see which one Christian will ask 
his housekeepers and assistants to 
make him. To add to his serial kill-
er persona, Christian spends copi-
ous amounts of time working out, 
taking showers and engaging in his 
aesthetic routines. (Christian Grey 
might actually be Patrick Bate-
man.) James is obviously trying 
to add world-building detail, but 
no one really cares that Christian 
likes to listen to Springsteen when 
he drives and the Black Eyed Peas 

when he runs.

Christian Grey should have been 

a compelling narrator, and “Grey” 
should have been an entertaining (if 
insubstantial) novel. But in expos-
ing the mystery of what’s going 
on in Christian’s head, E.L. James 
reveals that there’s really nothing 
interesting to see there. The abusive 
tendencies that were alluded to in 
Ana’s version of the story become 
more explicit and impossible to 

ignore. Anastasia, the series’ strong-
willed heroine, is disenfranchised 
in Christian’s crudely disrespectful 
retelling. These enormous missteps 
might be forgivable if “Grey” com-
mitted to being trashy and fun, but 
the story is painfully dull and the 
writing just stupid.

Maybe Stephenie Meyer had 

the right idea in keeping Edward 
Cullen’s thoughts in his head and 
off the page.

to cover the cost of hearing aids.
“More than 50 percent of the 
people who need a hearing aid in 
this country can’t afford one, so 
they don’t get one. And I want you 
to think about the quality of life 
you have if you can’t hear.”
Dingell also spoke of the current 
long-term care system’s failure to 
provide affordable preventative 
care, such as in-home health 
aides and healthy food service 
options.
“You need help with daily 
activities: of eating, and dress-
ing and bathing, and that we’ve 
gotta figure out how we do 
that...The current system is 
designed towards institutions. 
It’s not designed towards get-
ting you help,” Dingell said.
Attendees responded to Ding-
ell’s comments with their own 
opinions and worries about the 
long-term care system.
Some 
audience 
members 
spoke to the issue of changing 
pension policies for dependent, 

aging widows while others cited 
disappointment with long-term 
care insurance policies they 
previously 
bought. 
Another 
common concern was the gen-
eral shortage of caregivers.
In an interview with the 
Daily, Dingell said she realized 
people in the audience fear the 
lack of long-term care benefits 
available to them.
“I think that you can see how 
many people are scared and 
worried that they don’t have 
the resources that they need 
for things that could happen,” 
Dingell said.
Susan Salowitz, a resident of 
Pittsfield Township, attended 
the event and said she was glad 
to see Dingell making an effort 
to connect and sympathize with 
the senior community.
“I’m so pleased that Debbie 
Dingell was willing to come and 
at least listen to all of our com-
ments, get ideas… and let us 
know that she was trying very 
hard to relate to the problems of 
the many seniors in our area,” 
Salowitz said.

want to thank you guys as 
well. My last comment is to my 
beautiful children: We did this 
for you,” DeBoer said.
Carole Stanyar, one of the 
attorneys 
for 
DeBoer 
and 
Rowse, also spoke at the press 
conference, praising her team 
and clients for their hard work 
and resilience. She expressed 
pride in the accomplishments of 
her case.
“This was a definitive state-
ment under equal protection, 
fundamental right, liberty, due 
process,” Stanyar said. “It was 
for now, and it’s for future gen-
erations. The bans are uncon-
stitutional. States cannot treat 
people this way. They cannot 
treat people unequally. Same-
sex couples, their families, their 
children, have to be treated with 
dignity and respect,” Stanyar 
said.
In an interview with the press, 
Attorney General Bill Schuette 
said throughout litigations, his 
main argument challenged who 
would decide if same-sex mar-
riage should be recognized in 
different states.
“We argued this case is a 
question of who decides: the 

voters across the United States 
of America, or the Justices of 
the Supreme Court,” he said. 
“It was about voters and who 
decides, that was what the case 
was about.”
Ann 
Arbor 
Mayor 
Chris-
topher 
Taylor 
also 
offered 
remarks during the celebration. 
In an interview with the Daily, 
Taylor was enthusiastic about 
this progressive milestone in 
Michigan’s history.
“I could not be more excited 
for the people of Ann Arbor and 
for all Americans. This is a day 
when the Supreme Court has 
redeemed the American promise 
of equality before the law. It has 
ratified that gay, lesbian, trans-
gender and bisexual people are 
fully and finally embraced into 
the American family. It’s just — 
it’s wonderful,” Taylor said.
Beth 
Sherman, 
assistant 
professor of social work at 
the University and her wife, 
Karen Hawver, owner of Preci-
sion Accounting in Ann Arbor, 
attended the celebration and

ried in Michigan in March 2014

Michigan-led 
coalition wins 
SCOTUS challenge to 
emission standards

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily News Editor

WASHINGTON, D.C.— Last 
week’s ruling to legalize same-
sex marriage wasn’t the only 
Supreme 
Court 
decision 
in 
recent days directly tied to 
Michigan.
The Court struck down the 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency’s Mercury and Air Toxic 
Standards Monday in a victory 
for a coalition of twenty three 
states and interest groups, led 
by Michigan, who initially chal-
lenged the regulations in the 
D.C. Circuit Court last year.
The 5-4 decision marks the 
end of a twenty-five year push to 
create the first U.S regulations 
governing levels of mercury, 
arsenic, metals and several other 
airborne emissions for most 
power plants, first authorized in 
1990 amendments to the Clean 
Air Act.
21 power plants in Michigan 
would have been subject to the 
standards if enacted, though the 
overall impact may have been 
limited due to existing state reg-

ulation on mercury and other 
airborne emissions that closely 
parallels the standards laid out 
in MATS.
In a statement Monday morn-
ing, Michigan Attorney General 
Bill Schuette called the ruling a 
victory for both family budgets 
and job creation in the state.
“The court agreed that we 
can and must find a constructive 
balance in protecting the envi-
ronment and continuing Michi-
gan’s economic comeback,” he 
said.
The judicial challenge hinged 
primarily on language in the 
amendments that instructed the 
EPA to implement the regula-
tions only if they were deemed 
“appropriate 
and 
necessary”, 
examining what costs had to be 
included in that determination.
The government argued that 
under that mandate the EPA 
was only required to consider 
the public health costs of the 
emissions, not the financial 
costs to power plants, in the ini-
tial decision to regulate. How-
ever, Michigan Solicitor General 
Aaron 
Lindstrom, 
represent-
ing the states, argued that the 
financial costs were also perti-
nent.
Justice Antonin Scalia, in 
delivering the opinion of the 
Court, acknowledged that there 
are situations where “appropri-
ate and necessary” wouldn’t 

indicate the need to consider 
cost, but said MATS wasn’t one 
of them.
“Agencies have long treated 
cost as a centrally relevant fac-
tor when deciding whether to 
regulate,” the opinion read. 
“Consideration of cost reflects 
the understanding that rea-
sonable regulation ordinarily 
requires paying attention to the 
advantages and disadvantages 
of agency decisions.”
Scalia also emphasized that 
though the agency considered 
costs later on in the process of 
drafting MATS, that consider-
ation wasn’t enough.
“By EPA’s logic, someone 

could decide whether it is 
“appropriate” to buy a Ferrari 
without thinking about cost, 
because he plans to think about 
cost later when deciding whether 
to upgrade the sound system,” he 
wrote.
That point was a key disagree-
ment between the majority opin-
ion and the four justices who 
dissented.
In a dissent joined by the other 
three dissenting justices, Justice 
Elena Kagan wrote that in look-
ing at the EPA’s process of draft-
ing the regulations as a whole, it 
was clear that financial costs had 
been considered, fulfilling the 
mandate of appropriate and nec-

essary.
“When making its initial “appro-
priate but necessary” finding, EPA 
knew it would do exactly that — 
knew it would thoroughly consider 
the cost-effectiveness of emissions 
standards later on,” Kagan wrote. 
“That context matters.”
Finalized in 2011 and set to come 
into effect this year, MATS would 
have required most coal and oil-
powered power plants to reduce 
emissions by ninety percent for 
some substances, such as mercury, 
and close to ninety percent for sub-
stances like acid gas.

Supreme Court to review affirmative action

2013 case on race- 
based admission 
policy to resurface 

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

After a historic week for the 
Supreme Court, during which 
justices legalizedsame-sex mar-
riage and overturned EPA regu-
lations, the Court announced 
Monday it would review a 2013 
case 
concerning 
affirmative 
action at the University of Texas 
at Austin.
The Supreme Court will rule 

on the case in the upcoming fall 
session in early October.
In 2008, Abigail Fisher, a 
white 
student, 
was 
denied 
undergraduate admission to the 
University of Texas at Austin 
for reasons she claimed were 
racially biased. During litiga-
tion for the case, named Fisher 
v. University of Texas, Fisher 
alleged that the school’s admis-
sions policy was in violation of 
the Equal Protection Clause of 
the Fourteenth Amendment.
The 
University 
of 
Texas 
admits 
students 
under 
the 
Texas Ten-Percent Plan, a sys-
tem that guarantees admission 

to in-state students who gradu-
ate within the top ten percent of 
their high school class. Because 
of the plan, eighty-one percent 
of incoming freshman at the 
University of Texas were auto-
matically offered admission in 
2008.
While race is not considered 
in admissions for students cov-
ered by the Ten-Percent Plan, 
race remains a factor in the 
admissions process for appli-
cants of the University of Texas 
who do not graduate within the 
top ten percent of their high 
school class. Fisher graduated 
in the top 12 percent of her class; 

however, because of her grades 
and 
extracurricular 
activi-
ties, she believed she deserved 
admission.
The case brought to light 
complications concerning the 
Texas Ten Percent Plan, which 
subsequently 
prevented 
the 
University 
admissions 
office 
from adopting a similar policy.
However, 
some 
campus 
groups, like the Coalition for 
Defending Affirmative Action, 
advocate for it. If the Universi-
ty were to adopt a similar plan, 
the top students in every high 
school in Michigan would auto-
matically be offered admission, 

which some believe would natu-
rally create an incoming class 
of students from diverse back-
grounds.
The Supreme Court consid-
ered the case for eight months 
before reaching a 7-1 decision 
in 2013 that Fisher’s case would 
be retired to a lower court. The 
ruling was based on Grutter v. 
Bollinger, a 2003 case in which 
Barbara Gutter, a white stu-
dent, was denied admission to 
the University of Michigan Law 
School in 1997.

Louro back as starting goalie

By RILEY NELSON 

Daily Sports Writer

Even at 7 a.m. on a Wednesday 

morning in June, you can find 
sophomore goalie Evan Louro 
training, pushing himself to get 
better.

Such is life for one of the 

nation’s best goalkeepers.

The South River, New Jer-

sey native was a member of a US 
National Team from 2009-2013 
and is a product of the Red Bulls 
Academy, the development team 
for the Major League Soccer’s 
New York Red Bulls.

TopDrawerSoccer.com 
ranks 

Louro as the second-best goal-
keeper and 22nd overall player in 
the nation. He attended Saint John 
Vianney, and, as a top recruit, had 
a tough decision to make com-
ing out of high 
school.

In 
addition 

to being heav-
ily 
recruited 

by colleges, he 
was pursued by 
teams overseas.

“I 
had 
a 

couple of offers in England and a 
few in Germany,” Louro said. “I 
thought ultimately the best thing 
for me was to go to Michigan, 

because as soon as I went on my 
visit I loved it. I loved the campus, 
facilities. The coaches made me 
feel really welcome and the play-
ers as well … they all welcomed 

me with open 
arms.”

A huge part 

of 
that 
deci-

sion was former 
Michigan goalie 
Adam Grinwis, 
who was enter-
ing his senior 

season as Louro was starting.

“With Adam, he was there for 

four years, so he understands the 
game really well,” Louro said. “I 

think just spending time with 
him in the last year really helped 
me because … I don’t think I was 
ready for the college game and 
the understanding of all the tac-
tics and how differently you have 
to play, so I think he really helped 
me develop my understanding of 
college soccer.”

Last season, Louro played in 10 

matches, starting in eight all non-
conference games, and recorded a 
team-high 28 saves. At the end of 
the season he had a .718 save per-
centage — compared to Grinwis’ 
.684 — and a 1.28 goals against 
average.

Grinwis graduated and recent-

ly inked a contract with the New 
England 
Revolution 
affiliate 

Rochester Rhinos, which means 
it’s Louro’s turn to take the start-
ing position in net.

“I didn’t really know what to 

expect coming in to college soc-
cer,” Louro said. “I’ve heard from 
people that it’s a lot different than 
playing in the academy or playing 
for the national team and stuff 
like that. But (those experiences) 
helped me a lot and I’m ready.”

What’s next for this top-

ranked keeper? Helping bring a 
championship home to Ann Arbor, 
and he’s willing to stick around to 
see those results.

“I hope to bring a trophy to the 

University of Michigan, whether 
it’s the Big Ten or the National 
Championship – hopefully both,” 
Louro said. “Try to win as much 
as possible – Michigan’s already 
relevant, but put it on that next 
level of an elite program. It could 
be four years, that would be great, 
however long it takes.”

You can see Louro and the rest 

of the men’s soccer squad take the 
field at their home opener on Sep-
tember 4 against West Virginia.

Sophomore goaltender Evan Louro will take over the starting netminder job after entering as a prized recruit last summer.

Harbaugh being Harbaugh
 
Michigan football coach Jim 

Harbaugh has turned heads for 
more than just his Twitter account 
over the past few days. On Tuesday 
night, he threw out the ceremonial 
first pitch at Comerica Park in his 
signature khakis and a Tigers jer-
sey. In typical Harbaugh fashion, 
the pitch was less ceremonial and 
more competitive, as he asked if 
anyone clocked the pitch’s speed 
after he left the field.

The following morning, Har-

baugh stumbled through less than 
six minutes of an interview with 
ESPN Radio’s Colin Cowherd 
before the interview was cut off, 
with Cowherd calling it “a clunk-
er.” After several bland answers 
from the coach, Cowherd insisted 
that though he was trying to help 
Harbaugh sell the Michigan pro-
gram, the interview was “just not 
working.” 

Harbaugh later responded on 

Twitter: “In my experience of par-
ticipating in interviews, I’ve found 
it takes 2 to produce a clunker! 
I’ll take 50% responsibility 4 this 
clunker.”

 
Wolverines on the Move
 
Various former Wolverines in 

the NHL and the NBA have been 
traded in the past few days. Swed-
ish forward Carl Hagelin, who 
played at Michigan from 2007-
2011, was traded Saturday from 
the cap-constrained New York 
Rangers to the Anaheim Ducks as a 
pending restricted free agent. 

On Friday, the Buffalo Sabres 

traded Michigan rising junior for-
ward JT Compher’s rights to the 
Colorado Avalanche at the 2015 
NHL Entry Draft. Originally draft-
ed by the Sabres in the 2013 NHL 
Entry Draft, Compher will return 
to Michigan for his junior season 
as the Wolverines’ new captain, a 
title vacated when Andrew Copp 
decided to forgo his senior year of 
eligibility and sign a professional 
contract with the Winnipeg Jets. 

In the NBA, former Wolverine 

Tim Hardaway Junior was traded 
from the New York Nicks to the 
Atlanta Hawks on Draft night last 
Thursday. Hardaway, who played 
for Michigan from 2010-2013, was 
drafted at No. 24 by the Knicks in 
2013, but failed to perform up to 
the standards of Knicks president 
Phil Jackson, who made critical 
remarks about the guard Friday.

Hyman signs NHL entry deal 
with hometown Maple Leafs

Six selected 
in 2015 
NHL draft

By BRAD WHIPPLE 

Daily Sports Writer

After a breakthrough senior season, 

former Michigan forward Zach Hyman 
is looking to stand out on a stacked ros-
ter once again.

This time, it will be on hockey’s big-

gest stage for his hometown team.

On Saturday, the Toronto Maples 

Leafs announced that Hyman would 
join the organization as the result of 
a trade between the Maples Leafs and 
the Florida Panthers, the team that ini-
tially drafted him in 2011. In exchange 
for forward Greg McKegg, Toronto 
signed Hyman to a two-year entry level 
contract and received a conditional 
seventh round pick in the 2017 NHL 
Draft.

A Toronto native who spent his 

childhood watching 
Leafs’ games with his 
brothers and friends, 
Hyman will now get 
the chance to repre-
sent his favorite NHL 
team.

“I’m really excited 

and honored to be 
a part of the Maple 
Leaf’s organization,” 
Hyman said. “I grew 
up 
idolizing 
those 

players. It’s pretty incredible and really 
humbling to be a part of this organiza-
tion after growing up and watching so 
many great players. Now to be a part of 
it is pretty amazing and really special.”

Hyman will spend the rest of the 

summer prepping for the rookie and 

training camps at the end of August 
and into the beginning of September, 
which will determine if he makes the 
team. The Maple Leafs are now under 
the leadership of new head coach Mike 
Babcock, who will also be making the 
transition from Michi-
gan to Ontario with 
Hyman after spending 
10 seasons as coach of 
the Detroit Red Wings.

Given 
Babcock’s 

close relationship with 
Michigan coach Red 
Berenson, Hyman may 
find some leadership 
similarities 
between 

the two to help ease the transition and 
earn a spot on the roster.

“He’s one of the best coaches in the 

game, if not the best,” Hyman said. “To 

go from Coach Beren-
son to Coach Babcock — 
two great coaches — is 
special.”

Before 
his 
senior 

year, Hyman wasn’t on 
many teams’ radar at 
the collegiate or pro-
fessional level, but that 
didn’t deter him from 
making a lasting impact 
during his final sea-
son. The Hobey Baker 

Award finalist finished the year with 
22 goals, 32 assists and a Big-Ten lead-
ing 54 points — the first Michigan play-
er to reach the 50-point mark in one 
season since current New York Ranger 
Carl Hagelin in 2010.

“Coach always said seniors have to 

step up,” Hyman 
said. “You already 
have three years 
under your belt. … 
That’s what hap-
pens when you’re 
confident, you’ve 
worked hard and 
you’ve put in the 
work and time. 
I was fortunate 
enough to have a 
really good (first) 
weekend, 
and 

obviously it helps 
playing 
with 

great 
linemates 

and great team-
mates.”

Hyman 
was 

also 
a 
crucial 

component 
in 

the 
Wolverines 

capturing 
their 

16th Great Lakes 
invitational 
Championship in 
December, when 
Hyman 
scored 

game-winning 
goals in the semi-

finals and final against Michigan Tech 
and Michigan State, respectively.

But the efforts of the eventual Big 

Ten scoring champion wasn’t enough 
to push Michigan past the regular sea-
son and into the NCAA Tournament, as 

the Wolverines missed 
out on the chance for 
the third year in a 
row. Still, Hyman sees 
great 
potential 
for 

next year’s squad.

“Every year Michi-

gan reloads,” Hyman 
said. “We lost a lot of 
guys this year … (But) 
you got a lot of really 

great players coming back and a great 
leadership core with (JT Compher), 
(Boo Nieves), and (Justin Selman). 
Those guys are gonna take the reins, 
and I’m sure the team will follow. It’s 
gonna be a great year for them.”

Even with the success of his senior 

year, though, it’s back to Square one 
for the Hyman. Two weeks ago, he was 
named an Academic All American. Two 
weeks past, he’s a rookie trying to earn 
his spot on an professional team.

Given Hyman’s history, however, the 

forward may have no trouble exceeding 
expectations yet again.

“Nothing is really given, you just 

have to go out there and work for it,” 
Hyman said. “That’s how it is for any 
club and that’s how it is for Michigan.

“Coach Berenson always said ‘Noth-

ing is given to you. You work for what-
ever you get.’ ”

Many of his peers graduated from high 

school just a few weeks ago, but Zach 
Werenski showed he is more than ready for 
the road ahead.

After leaving high school a year early and 

leading the Michigan hockey team’s defense 
in an exceptional freshman season, earning 
praise from scouts nationwide, the 17-year 
old was taken with the eighth pick of Fri-
day’s 2015 NHL draft by the Columbus Blue 
Jackets.

With the selection, Werenski is Michi-

gan’s highest draft selection since Jack 
Johnson was taken third overall by the Car-
olina Hurricanes in 2005

“It’s unbelievable,” Werenski said. “I still 

can’t believe it happened. I’m very fortunate 
for the Columbus Blue Jackets to select me.”

Despite being just the youngest player 

in all of college hockey, Werenski showed 
why he was one of the world’s top prospects 
with Michigan. He led all Big Ten defense-
man with nine goals, and was named to the 
All-Big Ten First Team and Rookie Team. 
He also led the Wolverines with 59 blocked 
shots in 37 games, and showcased speed and 
versatility

Shortly 
after 
Werenski 
was 
taken 

by 
Columbus, 
Michigan 
recruit 
and 

Youngstown Phantoms forward Kyle Con-
nor was taken by the Winnipeg Jets with 
the 17th overall pick. This past season, Con-
nor was named the United States Hockey 
League’s Player of the Year after winning 
the league’s scoring title with 34 goals and 
80 points in 56 games. The 18-year-old Con-
nor has signed his Letter of Intent with 
Michigan and is expected to join the Wol-
verines in the fall.

Though Werenski now has the opportu-

nity to join the Blue Jackets if he signs by 
July 1, many expect him to remain with the 
Wolverines for his sophomore season or join 
the OHL’s London Knights.

“I haven’t thought too much about it,” 

Werenski said about his options. “I’m just 
living in the moment, it’s pretty surreal 
right now.”

Over the course of the draft, six current 

and future Wolverines are expected to be 
selected — tied for third all time.

In addition to Connor and Werenski, 

Cooper Marody, Brendan Warren, Joe Cec-
coni, and Nicholas Boka were taken on Day 
2 of the draft. 

All six Wolverines plan to put their pro-

fessional careers on hold however, to attend 
Michigan for at least one season.

In addition to Hyman, sophomore defenseman Zach Werenski and five Wolverine signees earned professional deals (see right).

“I grew up 

idolizing those 
players ... It is 

pretty amazing.”

“You just have 
to go out there 
and work for it.”

2015 Schefters: The awards 
for when you’re feeling blue

By MAX COHEN and 

JAKE LOURIM 

Daily Sports Editors

Sure, this wasn’t necessarily 

a year to remember in Michigan 
athletics. In the most tradition-
ally popular sports, there was 
the miserable football season, 
the injury-riddled men’s basket-
ball season and a hockey season 
that ended with the Wolverines 
falling short of the NCAA Tour-
nament for the third straight 
year.

In total, Michigan’s three big-

gest sports all failed to make the 
postseason in the same year for 
the first time since 1972-73.

But here, we’re celebrating 

only the positive of Michigan 
athletics. The Daily presents 
the 2015 Schefters, our annual 
look back at the best of the year 
in Wolverine sports. The awards 
are named after Adam Schefter, 
an NFL Insider for ESPN and one 
of the Daily’s most prominent 
alumni.

We can’t promise anything, but 

there might even be a Jim Har-
baugh mention.

Breakout Athlete of the Year: 

Zach Hyman, Ice Hockey

For the first three years of Zach 

Hyman’s career at Michigan, he 
showed glimpses of the talent that 
led the Florida Panthers to make 
him their fifth-round selection in 
the 2010 NHL draft. But it wasn’t 
until his senior season that he put 
it all together.

Hyman tallied 22 goals and 32 

assists during his senior season, 
his 54 points well surpassing the 
35 points he had scored in his pre-
vious three seasons combined.

Not only did Hyman fare well 

compared to previous versions of 
himself, but also compared to the 
rest of the conference and country. 
Hyman led the Big Ten in scoring, 
was a first team All-American and 
was a finalist for the Hobey Baker 
Award, college hockey’s most 
prestigious honor.

Single-Event 
Perfor-

mance: Jim Harbaugh’s intro-
ductory press conference

You knew he had to be men-

tioned in this, didn’t you? In a 
year in which the performances of 
many of Michigan’s most popular 
teams left fans unsatisfied, Har-
baugh’s introductory press confer-
ence on Dec. 30 delivered in every 
single way.

Sure, Harbaugh could have 

stood up at the podium and stared 
intently into the cameras for 15 
minutes and you all would have 
been satisfied, but he ended up 
hitting all the right notes in his 
formal introduction as the Wol-
verines’ coach. Harbaugh spoke 
about becoming Michigan’s coach 
as if it were a homecoming, and 
he finally gave football fans some-
thing to look forward to after a 
disaster-filled 5-7 season.

For one day, anything seemed 

possible. Except, of course, for 
Harbaugh’s soon-to-be created 
Twitter account. Some things are 
too ridiculous to imagine.

Game of the Year: No. 6 Wis-

consin 69, Michigan 64 (OT), 
Men’s Basketball

ESPN’s “College GameDay” 

in town, a sellout crowd for a 
Saturday night tip and a chance 
to earn a marquee win over the 

No. 6 team in the country: It just 
didn’t seem like enough to keep 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team in the game against Wis-
consin on Jan. 24.

The matchup appeared to be 

a mismatch: The Wolverines 
were 12-7, unranked and play-
ing without their best player in 
junior guard Caris LeVert, who 
had suffered a season-ending 
foot injury the previous week-
end. The Badgers were 17-2, in 
the driver’s seat in the Big Ten 
and starting All-American cen-
ter Frank Kaminsky along with 
another future NBA Draft pick 
in Sam Dekker.

But the Wolverines summoned 

one of their best efforts of the 
season, battling Wisconsin in the 
most exciting game of the year.

With Michigan trailing late 

in the game, sophomore guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. scored seven 
points in the final 24 seconds 
— punctuated by a game-tying 
3-pointer with 1.3 ticks left — to 
send the game into overtime.

He finished with 17 points, 

but in the end, his magic wasn’t 
enough as Wisconsin outlasted 
the Wolverines in a classic.

Coach of the Year: Carol 

Hutchins, Softball

The years when Hutchins isn’t a 

viable candidate for this award are 
few and far between. Even so, her 
31st season as Michigan’s softball 
coach was special.

The 
Wolverines 
won 
their 

eighth straight Big Ten champion-
ship in dominating fashion, accu-
mulating a 21-2 record against 
conference foes. The success con-
tinued in the postseason, where 
Michigan won the Big Ten Tour-
nament for the first time since 
2006.

The Wolverines didn’t lose a 

game in the postseason until the 

finals of the Women’s College 
World Series in Oklahoma City. 
Michigan finished the season 
as the No. 2 team in the country, 
the program’s best result since its 
national championship in 2005.

Hutchins’ ability as a coach was 

apparent in the non-strategic ele-
ments of the game as well. Though 
she tends to project an image of 
constant intensity, she allowed her 
players to have what seemed to be 
the time of their lives, “making 
pizza” and scoring runs.

No coach at Michigan has 

done more to further a sport than 
Hutchins, and this year’s Wom-
en’s College World Series was the 
most-watched version of the event 
in history. Even Hutchins would 
smile about that.

Team of the Year: Women’s 

Softball

The Wolverines put together 

one of the most dominant sea-
sons in their illustrious history, 
finishing 60-8 and capturing 
Big Ten regular-season, Big Ten 
Tournament, regional and Super 
Regional crowns. They lost to 
No. 1 Florida in a hard-fought 
Women’s College World Series 
final, first losing 3-2 before eve-
ning the series with a 1-0 win 
and finally dropping the winner-
take-all game, 4-1.

Until then, they had dominated 

their opponents all season long. 
They outscored them, 540-125. 
Seven starters hit above .300. Five 
smacked at least a dozen homers. 
Four drove in at least 60 runs. 
Two pitchers — senior Haylie 
Wagner and sophomore Megan 
Betsa — won at least 25 games, 
posting nearly identical 1.75 and 
1.72 earned-run averages.

When they captivated Michi-

gan fans all over the country dur-
ing the World Series, they proved 
they were the Team of the Year.
