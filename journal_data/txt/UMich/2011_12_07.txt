SEEKING OUT A SECRET SHOW

UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
Renovated
emergency
department
to open today

LOCAL BUSINESSES
Borders spot on East Liberty still
vacant due to legal issue with lease

27 rooms added due
to greater number
of patients
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
Doors open today to a $17.7
million renovated Adult Emer-
gency Department in the Uni-
versity Hospital, which is
designed to provide improved
waiting areas and additional
space for patient treatment.
The new space added 27
patient rooms and augments the
size of the departmentby nearly
17 percent or 5,800 square feet.
Jennifer Holmes, director of
operations for the University's
emergency department, said
the renovation was necessary
to accommodate the increased
number of patient visits, which
have been approximately 200
each day.
"We needed additional space
to meet our patient volume,"
Holmes said. "And we really
wanted to provide a better space
for patients."
In 2009, a survey by the Cen-

ters for Disease Control and
Prevention found that emer-
gency department visits had
reached 136 million nationwide,
a 10-percent increase from the
previous year.
Beside meeting spatial needs,
the renovations provide more
convenient grouping of nursing
stations to ease communication.
The new wing also features
some aesthetic improvements
such as frosted glass, framed
photographs and accent colors.
The renovation was possible
because the Pediatric Emer-
gency Department moved to the
new C.S. Mott Children's Hospi-
tal and Von Voigtlander Wom-
en's Hospital, which officially
opened on Sunday.
The last Adult Emergency
Department construction proj-
ect ended in 2001. However,
Holmes said that for the last
five or six years, there has been
a need for a more open space to
allow for a more comfortable tri-
age check-in area and a smooth-
er transition from check-in to an
emergency room bed.
"We really felt there was
a more efficient way to bring

building that formerly housed
Borders remains vacant.
Tom Heywood, executive
director of the State Street Area
Association, said the Ann Arbor
community will have to wait a
while before it sees another store
in the former Borders building.
Heywood said the wait is due
to an ongoing legal issue stem-
ming from the current lessee,
who was subletting the building
to Borders when the bookstore
went bankrupt in February. The

East Liberty Borders location
closed in September..
According to Heywood, the
owners of the building are suing
the current lessee in Washtenaw

effort to terminate the lease. The
owners will not be able to lease
the space to another tenant until
the current agreement is termi-
nated.

DPS identifies suspect of
reported sexual assault

University Police have identi-
fied and interviewed a suspect in
Monday's sexual assault in Baits

I Residence Hall, according to
University Department of Pub-

Brown.
A student reported being sex-
ually assaulted in Baits I Resi-

Brown confirmed that the
sexual assault was classifiable as
rape - which according to the
Michigan Penal Code includes
circumstances in which the the
actor sexually penetrates the

New market opens
today on corner of
Washington and
Division streets
By HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily Arts Writer
Walking into babo: a market by
sava, it's easy to forget the fluores-
cently lit, barren grocery stores of
shopping trips past.
Glowing light bulbs hang

from the ceiling, and industrial
metal appliances meld with the
antiquated wood furniture and
decor arranged on the walls.
Full-length windows feature the
corner of Washington and Divi-
sion streets as the backdrop for
the market, creating a blend of
city life and rustic charm. The
exposed high ceilings through-
out the market yearn to be filled
with the sweet smells of freshly
baked bread and delicacies. Babo
is a place where food meets art,
and grocery shoppingtransforms
from an errand to an experience.

The aesthetic appearance of
the market, which opens today,
even applies to the products. Paul
Hannah, general manager of the
market, said babo selects quality
products whose labels play to the
design of the market.
"We want the store to kind of
have a sexy feel to it," Hannah
said. "We want people to walk in
and want to buy everything that
they see."
Along with retail food prod-
ucts, the market will also offer
prepared foods, baked goods,

Building a giant windmill on the
Diag, canoeing on Lake Huron and
teaching West Bloomfield, Mich.
elementary students about the water
cycle are just some of the environ-
mental endeavors undertaken by the
student environmental group EnAct.
Founded in 1970, the group is the
oldest environmental activism club
on campus with a focus on environ-
mental outreach and education.
The goal of EnAct is to spread
environmentalawarenessin avariety
of ways and places, said LSA sopho-
more Libby O'Connell, one of the
leaders of EnAct.
"(We want to) foster environ-
mentally friendly attitudes and pro-
mote activities on and off campus..."
O'Connell said. "We take anyone who

has any concern for the environment."
LSA senior Dannie Miller, a mem-
ber of EnAct, said the club's history
is a major factor in its role on campus
today.
"Environmental action came out
of the first Earth Day at U of M,"
Miller said.
She added that EnAct is a vehicle
for students with ideas about sus-
tainability on campus to make them
a reality.
"One really important part of
EnAct is that it's run by the people
who participate," she said.
Once a semester, club members
organize a free market, in which they
sell notebooks made from recycled
cereal boxes and one-sided paper
from the Fish Bowl in Angell Hall.

Other events include environmen-
tal service days called Hands on the
Planet and Art on the Diag, an art
show during National Environmental
Week in April.
O'Connell said the club's meetings
are democratically organized and
designed to encourage input from all
members.
"No pun intended, but we're all
very down-to-Earth," O'Connell said.
LSA senior Kyle Anderson, anoth-
er EnAct member, said the club's
presence provides an outlet for dis-
cussion of environmental ethics and
fun activities.
"(EnAct is) an importantclub with
good values, and I getto make change
and have fun," Anderson said.

BABO
From Page 1A

meats and cheeses sliced to order,
coffee and fresh produce, accord-
ing to babo owner and operator
Sava Lelcaj, who owns Sava's Res-
taurant on State Street.
Hannah, who previously
worked as the wine director at
Vinology on Main Street and was
an employee of Zingerman's Deli-
catessen, stressed the mission of
the market isn't simply to provide
food to customers, but to provide
a culinary experience.
"We want to sell food that
enhances people's lives - not
only the people who consume it
but also the people who make it,"
Hannah said. "All these products
have histories and stories, and
there's a romance to them and we
want people to know that"
Cards placed in front of each
item in the store will detail why a
product was selected for the mar-
ket and what the item is, Hannah
explained. The cards will fea-
ture the signature script of Dave
Lafave, the local artist respon-
sible for the design of babo.
Lafave, who previously worked
at Selo/Shevel Gallery on Main
Street, employs only repurposed
goods in his chic, rustic designs
and shops locally at reclamation
centers in Detroit.
"Everything thatI find literally
comes out of the garbage," Lafave
said. "I clean it up, brush it down,
sand it, paint it white, paint it
some crazy color and implement
(the item) somehow into the lay-
out of the store."
Lafave will also paint and

decorate the full-length window
displays in babo every 30 days to
represent a seasonal theme or the
introduction of a new product in
the market - currently, a holi-
day theme graces its panes. He
said he plans to keep the market's
appearance as fresh on the out-
side as the products within.
"Sometimes a window might
sort of speak to the color or shape
of the package a product comes
in or if the product adds itself to
a theme," Lafave said. "We never
want to go stale with our visual
image on the street."
Lelcaj said Lefave's knack for
reusing and repurposing has
extended to the rest of the mar-
ket, from appliances to the fur-
niture. Wood, which softens the
industrial look throughout the
store, was restored from a barn
that burned down.
"Everything is repurposed,
and we found really creative peo-
ple to help build out the space,"
Lelcaj said. "We've been consci-
entious of our carbon footprint
when working with the space and
selecting Energy Star equipment
and reusing and repurposing as
many things as possible."
Energy-efficient equipment
will be used to create prepared
foods, which patrons can eat at
babo, take to go or order through
a catering service, Hannah said.
Lelcaj added the dishes, made in
hodse by chefs in an open kitchen,
will vary depending on the food
in season and will include mostly
ingredients from the market itself
in a diverse way.
Chefs will join customers in
the market as they select prod-
ucts to include in dishes, Lelcaj

said. Customers will also receive
recipe cards with their dishes,
allowing patrons to return to the
market and buy the ingredients
to make their own rendition of a
babo meal.
Customers can dine in at a
community high-top table, which
also stems from Lafave's integra-
tion of repurposed goods in the
market. The table, which seats 20
people, is made of two 125-year-
old refurbished doors found atthe
Reclamation Center in Detroit.
Inspired by the markets of Lon-
don and other big cities, Hannah
said he hopes the communal table
will help bring patrons together
in their experiences at babo.
"You're going to be eating with
people you don't know, breaking
bread and sharing wine," Hannah
said. "And I think that's the fun
part."
Patrons can break bread in babo
seven days a week from 8 a.m. to
10 p.m., and the market will serve
prepared breakfast, lunch and
dinner, according to Lelcaj. A beer
and wine department will also be
available after the market secures
a liquor license.
While the food and experience
bab will offer are distinctive,
Hannah said the true character of
babo lies in the face of the market
- the full-length windows look-
ing out onto Washington Street.
"I think when it's all said and
done, the most unique thing
about the market are these
windows," Hannah said. "Most
times you walk into a market
and you walk from sunshine
into a dark place that's fluores-
cent lighting, and here, it's part
of the street."

Demonstrators
continue protesting
Putin election fraud
MOSCOW (AP) - Police
clashed with demonstrators pro-
testing alleged election fraud in
Moscow and at least two other
major Russian cities yesterday as
anger boiled over against strong-
man Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin and his United Russia party.
At least 250 people were
detained by police at a protest in
downtown Moscow that included
flare-type fireworks thrown at a
group of pro-Kremlin youth, said
city police spokesman Maxim
Kolosvetov.
Russian news agencies report-
ed about 200 were arrested at a
similar attempt to hold anunsanc-
tioned rally in St. Petersburg and
another 25 in the southern city of
Rostov-on-Don. The Moscow pro-
test ended after around 3 1/2 hours
and the others were broken up by
police.
It was the second consecutive
night of large protests in Moscow
and St. Petersburg, an unusually
sustained show of indignation as
Russian police routinely crack
down hard on unauthorized ral-

lies, and protesters generally take
time to regroup for a new attempt.
The demonstrations follow
Sunday's parliamentary election,
in which United Russia lost a large
share of the seats it had held in the
State Duma. The party maintains
a reduced majority, but opponents
say even that came because of vote
fraud.
Local and international election
observers reported widespread
ballot-stuffing and irregularities
in the vote count.
The protesters appear to be
both angered by the reported
fraud and energized by the vote's
show of declining support for
Putin and his party, which has
strongly overshadowed all other
political forces in Russia for the
past dozenyears.
But pro-Kremlin supporters
also put on a pair of large rallies
in Moscow, attracting thousands
and showing vehement divisions
in Russian society.
The Moscow protest demon-
strated the violent potential of
those divisions.
Several hundred young men
with emblems of United Russia
and its youth wing had gathered
with police at Triumphal Square
in the city center ahead of the
planned opposition rally. Police

waded into several groups of oppo-
sition supporters, pushing them
away from the square - roughly
grabbing many and throwing
them into police vehicles. Detain-
ees included prominent opposition
leaders Boris Nemtsov and Edu-
ard Limonov, but Russian news
reports said both were released
from custody late yesterday.
After the protesters were
pushed back, they and govern-
ment supporters shouted at each
other - "Shame, shame" was the
call from the opposition, while the
others, some of whom beat drums,
shouted "Putin victory." Members
of the pro-authorities group gravi-
tated toward the nearby Tchai-
kovsky Concert Hall, continuing
to chant and bang drums. Then
at least two flare-type fireworks
were thrown into their midst.
It was unclear who threw the
devices or if anyone was injured.
The confrontation lasted more
than three hours before pro-gov-
ernment youth began leaving the
area.
About a half-mile away, around
100 demonstrators chanting
against Putin held a short march
from the U.S. Embassy toward
the Russian White House, but
scattered when police arrived in
buses.

Police: Former
Miss USA arrested
for drunk driving
Former Miss USA Rima Fakih
was driving with a half-empty
bottle of champagne and a blood-
alcohol level more than twice the
legal limit when she was arrest-
ed on a drunken driving charge
in the Detroit enclave of High-
land Park, according to a police
report released yesterday.
The report obtained by The
Associated Press through a Free-
dom of Information Act request
says the 26-year-old from Dear-
born was pulled over early Sat-
urday going 60 mph, weaving in
heavy traffic and changing lanes
without using a turn signal.
A police officer whose name
was given only as R. Kalis said
the traffic stop happened about
2:15 a.m.
GENEVA
Clinton opens
talks with Syrian
gov't opposition
The Obama administration
moved to expand contacts with
opponents of Syria's President
Bashar Assad yesterday as Sec-
retary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton held a rare meeting with
Syrian opposition figures and the
top U.S. envoy to Syria returned
to Damascus after a six-week
absence.
Amid reports of a new surge
in violence that the U.N. says has
killed more than 4,000 people
since an uprising against Assad
erupted in March, Clinton told
Syrian pro-reform activists in
Geneva that she wanted to hear
their plans to establish a new
democratic government if they
are successful in prying Assad
and his regime from power.
The invitation was a step short
of endorsement, but a clear sign
the U.S. wants to work closely
with those who might assume
leadership roles.
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras
Honduran
journalist killed
outside her home
A radio news host was fatally
shot by gunmen on motorcycles
yesterday as she commuted to
work in the capital of Honduras,
where rampant drug-trafficking
and weak, corrupt policing are
fueling one of the world's worst
homicide rates.
Luz Marina Paz and her driv-
er were hit by dozens of bullets
fired by men on two motorcycles
outside Paz's home in Teguci-
galpa, national police spokesman
Luis Maradiaga said.
Paz, 38, hosted a morning
program called "Three in the

News" broadcast on the Hondu-
ran News Channel. While she
discussed politics and narcotics
trafficking, she was not among
Honduras' best-known or most
outspoken journalists.
TOKYO
Radiation traces
0 found in Japanese
baby formula
Traces of radiation spilled
from Japan's hobbled nuclear
plant were detected in baby
formula yesterday in the latest
case of contaminated food in the
nation.
Major food and candy maker
Meiji Co. said it was recall-
ing canned powdered milk for
infants, with expiration dates of
October 2012, as a precaution.
The levels of radioactive
cesium were well below gov-
ernment-set safety limits, and
the company said the amounts
were low enough not to have any
affect on babies' health even if
they drank the formula every
day.
Experts say children are more
at risk than are adults of getting
cancer and other illnesses from
radiation exposure.

and lessee involved in the legal
battle, and the courts will deter-
mine when the building will have
another retailer.
"Until all this gets ironed out,
they can't legally lease it out to
anyone, and who knows who may
have shown interest," Heywood
said.
Other recently vacated prop-
erties have had more luck finding
tenants.
Randy Maas, associate broker
with Swisher Commercial who
manages the property once occu-
pied by Poshh, said a prospective
tenant of the space is looking at
a five-year lease term. Maas said
he expects that the lease will be
signed by the end of the year.
Maas declined to comment on
who the prospective tenant is,
but said he is not surprised that
the property has generated so
much interest.
"We figured it would turn
around fairly quickly for that
location," he said. "It's a great
location in Ann Arbor near one
of the busiest intersections in the
county."
Apart from retailers, other
more entrepreneurial-focused
businesses are moving into office
spaces on East Liberty.
Menlo Innovations, a soft-
ware design and development
company, recently signed a
10-year lease for the space next
to TechArb, which is managed
by the University's Center for
Entrepreneurship. The business
accelerator leases space in the
Offices at Liberty Square, locat-
ed on the corner of East Liberty
and South Division streets.
Carol Sheridan, factory floor
manager for Menlo, said the
company moved because of space
constraints in its former Kerry-

town offices, and the business is
excited to be in its new location
next to the TechArb.
"I think the proximity to the
University of Michigan is a draw
for us," Sheridan said. "Another
draw for us is that we're right
next door to TechArb, which we
think is an interesting collabora-
tion."
Tom Gritter, vice president
and managing director of com-
mercial real estate with McKin-
ley Inc., which owns the Offices
at Liberty Square, said he has
seen a variety of businesses move
onto East Liberty during his time
in the area.
"It's really turned into an
entrepreneurial hub for offices
right there because you have all
the retail amenities and the ben-
efits of being right next to the
University of Michigan campus,
but then you also have a lot of
creative companies that want to
be right next to each other," Grit-
ter said.
Gritter added that McKinley
has been involved in real estate
on East Liberty for the past five
years, and he believes that the
reduced foot traffic caused by
Borders' absence is temporary.
"A lot of retail streets ... go
through transitions," Gritter
said. "Borders, obviously being
a big anchor tenant, I think hurt
some of the smaller users that
aren't as much stand alone (busi-
nesses) or maybe just benefit
from the traffic that comes from
a Borders type of operator in the
space."
Andrea Graef, owner of the
former This & That store, told
The Michigan Daily in October
that the Borders closure resulted
in less patrons for East Liberty
Street stores, which was a factor
in her decision to close her store.
Other reasons for her store's
closing were panhandling in the
area and an increase in competi-
tion.

Several departments con-
tributed to planning the
renovation, including the
Information Technology

nal and external construction
crews.
Steven Kronick, director of

the emergency department,

were instrumental in planning
the renovation.

said. "And I really want to pro-
vide the campus community
and Ann Arbor our unique per-
spective, and our authoritative
coverage and really empha-
size that, but also continue to
emphasize how we deliver our
content to our readers."
Lichterman said he plans
to focus more on social media,
something that LSA senior
Stephanie Steinberg, the Dai-
ly's current editor in chief,
pushed for during her term.
"I want to take that to the
next level and really encour-
age every staff member to get
a Twitter account, build up an
audience and really become a
brand and make themselves an
authority on their beat, wheth-
er it be reviewing movies or
covering City Council," Lich-
terman said.
Like Lichterman, Busi-
ness School sophomore Ash-
ley Griesshammer and LSA
sophomore Andrew Weiner
were also elected next year's
co-editorial page editors by the
entire Daily staff. Griessham-
mer said she and Weiner plan
to bring increased diversity to
the editorial staff to represent
more viewpoints and make the
opinion page more vibrant.
"To start, we're being a lot
more selective with our col-
umnists and trying to find a
much more diverse group of
people coming from different
schools on campus, different
backgrounds and people that
are going to talk about differ-
ent topics and not have every-
one write about politics every
week," Griesshammer said.
LSA senior Josh Healy, who
was appointed the 2012 man-
aging editor and is the current
copy chief, said increasing staff
diversity is a top priority. He
added that he looks forward to
working with the new class of
editors.
"We've got some extremely
strong talent around the paper
right now, so the possibilities in
terms of content and the qual-
ity that we're going to be able to
produce is pretty outstanding,"

Healy said.
Public Policy junior Beth-
any Biron, who is currently a
senior news editor, was elect-

will be working in the space
in every step along the way,
to the point where we mocked
up rooms and got staff into the
space to see where the equip-
ment was, and how they would
interact with the equipment
so that it could be used in the
most efficient way," Kronick
said.
Holmes said this part of the
planning stage allowed staff
to make adjustments as neces-
sary.
"We had to do some interim
tweaking when we thought the
turning radius might be too
tight for a stretcher," she said.
According to Holmes, most
of the equipment in the new
space is not new, except for the
addition of higher-end ultra-
sound machines. She explained
the upcoming year. Biron said
one of her top priorities is to
improve communication not
only within the news section
but between all the sections
in order to foster collaborative
work.
"I'm very excited," Biron
said. "I've been on the news
staff since freshman year, and
I've loved every moment of it,
and I can't wait to stick around
next year and see how the news
section progresses and what
we can do to make it better."
The same level of dedica-
tion toward the paper was
expressed by LSA junior Leah
Burgin, a current senior arts
editor and the next managing
arts editor.
"I'm excited, but it also feels
really natural because I love
the Daily, and this is something
I've wanted to do for a while to
give back to the institution,"
Burgin said.
She added that she intends to
revamp the arts section of the
website to cater more toward
readers and to focus on the arts
section's community culture
beat. Like Biron, Burgin said
she intends to work on improv-
ing communication between
arts and the other sections of
the Daily.
LSA junior Stephen Nesbitt
will continue his current posi-
tion as managing sports editor
into the next term. Nesbitt said
the biggest challenge for the
sports section has been striv-
ing to provide quality coverage
across the board for the more
than 25 sports at the University.
Nesbitt said the section has
attracted many new reporters
who have great potential to
cover upcoming spring sports.
"I think we have some real-
ly good young talent that we
want to keep around," he said.
"I'm really excited about the
beat writers we have going
right now. It should be a great
semester with hockey, basket-
ball, women's basketball and
all the spring sports coming
into term."
LSA juniors Jennifer Xu and
Dylan Cinti were appointed co-
editors for the paper's weekly
magazine The Statement. Xu
said she wants to encourage
more of a magazine commu-
nity within the Daily by hold-

ing weekly Statement meetings
and having more in-person
reads between editors and
writers.
Cinti said he will push for
stories supported by data avail-

that equipment is replaced
when new models are on the
market, and thus did not need
to be updated because of the
renovation.
Holmes also said the delayed
opening of the new Mott facil-
ity, originally slated for the
beginning of November, com-
plicated the new facilities'
unveiling.
"When that got delayed it
made things a little hectic, but
we worked through it," she
said.
As the new emergency
department opens today,
Holmes said itmis true that the
new rooms are a little nicer
than the older wings of the
department.
"We have the old shoe

to working with longer and
more investigative stories that
make use of imiiiiedia. --
"I'm really excited for next
year because it's much more of a
visionary position," Cinti said.
"(There is) a lot more potential
for integrating not only news,
but also the visual component
and the graphic component and
making that emerge into some-
thing that's really cool."
Public Policy junior Zach
Bergson was appointed online
editor of the paper. LSA senior
Sarah Squire currently holds
the position under the title of
web development manager.
Bergson will focus on mul-
timedia, further developing
the Daily's website, overseeing
the Daily's blogs and managing
the paper's social media activ-
ity. Bergson said he is excited
to take on the role of online
editor, but also recognizes the
level of innovation that will be
required.
"It is daunting because the
role is so new," Bergson said.
"There are certain things that
I'm required to do, but a lot of
it is just my own initiative. So
for me, it's a lot different than
everyone else's job because I
don't really have a set job."
Art & Design and LSA soph-
omore Arjun Mahanti will be
the managing design editor
next year and Art & Design
sophomore Alden Reiss and
LSA sophomore Erin Kirkland
will be the co-managing photo
editors. Reiss said a big initia-
tive for the photo staff next
year is to redevelop its blog and
Twitter account, which are
currently inactive.
LSA senior Christine Chun
and LSA sophomore Hannah
Poindexter, next semester's co-
copy chiefs,both said theywant
to expand the copy section
by copy editing more stories
from different sections. The
copy section currently reads all
news and Statement content,
as well as some articles in the
opinion and arts sections.
Poindexter described plans
to establish a program centered
on exchanging feedback with
reporters about the changes
the copy section makes to their

stories in order to help them
develop as writers.

Drive awav sales tax
Senate shouldn't adopt infrastructure proposal
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder presented a report in late Octo-
ber from the state House of Representatives Transporta-
tion Committee that found the costs to meet Michigan's
infrastructure needs would exceed the current budget allotment by
$1.4 billion. In an attempt to account for this discrepancy, the state
Senate is considering a proposal to increase infrastructure funding
by replacing the current gas tax with an increased sales tax. The
proposal would unfairly tax residents and should not replace the
current gas tax.

In Michigan, infrastructure funding
comes from a 19 cent per gallon state tax on
gas. The proposal put forward by state Sen.
Howard Walker (R-Traverse City) last week
would replace the revenue lost from cutting
the gas tax by increasing the state sales tax
from 6 percent to 7 percent. The extra rev-
enue - estimated at $830 million in 2012 by
the Senate Fiscal Agency - would go to the
Michigan Transportation Fund.
According to the Michigan Department
of Transportation, the state would lose $962
million if the gas tax were repealed. The rev-
enue from Walker's proposal would increase
to an estimated $1.14 billion in2013, but costs
associated with implementing the measure
could lower the potential revenues, accord-
ing to the Michigan Infrastructure and
Transportation Association.
A gas tax is a logical way to raise revenue
for state road repairs. Under the current
system, when drivers buy gas, they pay for
their vehicle's fuel and use of the road. This
system makes sense because drivers who use
the roads are the people paying to upkeep
them. By increasing in the sales tax, the
Legislature would be putting the burden on
all Michigan residents instead of those who
use roads the most.
In order to raise the sales tax, voters
would have to amend the state constitution.
As the recession has been particularly harsh
in Michigan, it will be difficult to convince

residents to voluntarily raise taxes. The cam-
paign for the proposal would be costly and
time consuming, and no back-up plan to gen-
erate the funds lost by repealing the gas tax
currently exists. Michigan's already deterio-
rating infrastructure would be set back even
further if voters rejected the measure.
Proponents of repealing the gas tax say
cities along Michigan's border are hurt when
drivers go to neighboring states to fill up their
vehicles, but there is little evidence of signifi-
cant economic impact. The proposal does not
solely impact border cities, and justifications
based on the impact to border cities alone fail
to account for the good of the state.
Lowering the price of gas would also nega-
tively impact the environment. The gas tax
and high gas prices discourage people from
driving, which means less greenhouse gases
from tailpipes are released. A repeal of the
gas tax would likely increase gas sales, and
it would not discourage people from making
environmentally conscious driving decisions.
There is no doubt that the state's infra-
structure must be addressed, seeing that
Michigan's roads are consistently voted some
of the worst in the nation. But this proposal
puts Michigan in a worse position to fix the
problem. Other proposals - including rais-
ing vehicle registration fees - should be
explored to return Michigan's roads back to
favorable conditions and to fund the project
the right way.

Pass on English grades

For most classes, I know what I have to do
to get a good grade. Math, do more practice
problems. Science, study the book and make
flashcards. But with English classes, I feel
powerless to increase my grade through sheer
hard work. Writing is an extremely important
skill for all majors. If you are able to write well,
you will succeed in more jobs and be more
valuable to your field of study. It is important
to be able to communicate your ideas to other
professionals, but students should be focusing
on improving this vital skill instead of pleas-
ingthe professor. English classes are extreme-
ly subjective, and 100 level classes should be
taken pass/fail. of course, it is possible to take
any class pass/fail, but that option tends to
look bad on a transcript. Most students, pro-
fessors and professional or graduate schools
see a pass/fail class as a way to hide a C-.
There is such variance in English profes-
sors. English 100 level classes are taught by
a variety of instructors, from graduate stu-
dent instructors to lecturers and professors.
Each level has different standards for A, B
and C papers because of their differences in
experience. English professors also do not
put papers through a scantron - there is no
formulaic standard for grading and instead,
the grade is based off the specific professors'
nuances. The best way for students in differ-
ent English classes to be treated equally is to
change the format of the classes to be taken
pass/fail.
It is usually easy to tell if a student has put
effort into a paper. If the paper meets require-
ments, has insight, an interesting thought pro-
cess and has been edited, itusually will receive
at least a C. The variances come in the passing
grades, Cs through As. But this can be the dif-

ference in getting into a good graduate school.
An A paper for one professor may be a C to
another. Students applying to medical school,
the Ross School of Business or any graduate
school in general, need a high GPA. Some stu-
dents enroll in the College of Literature Sci-
ence and the Arts to go into the sciences and
do not need to be the next Hemingway. They
need to be able to communicate their ideas
clearly, not tell amazingstories in fantastically
creative ways. Most students expect English
to be a class that can boost their GPAs and, for
some it is, but for others who are stuck with
hard graders it can cause their GPAs to suffer.
The difference in English professors' grades
can artificially inflate or deflate a student's
GPA regardless of the academic ability of the
student. Graduate or professional schools do
not know which students had harsh graders
and which had easier ones. The schools might
pass over a student with a lower GPA for a
higher one - unaware that the student with
the lower GPA was writing better papers for a
more-difficult-to-please professor.
The point of English classes is to increase.
the writing ability of students. Professors
stress that the class is not about getting an A
but exploring oneself through interesting top-
ics. Grammar and clarity can be improved by
learning the rules, but a person's writing style
is entirely their own and should not have to
be compromised to fit the likes of a professor.
Writing is an art form and personal opinion
on how something should be communicated.
Making English 100 level classes pass/fail
would allow students to keep their creative
license without sacrificing a good grade.

The Farmers Market, the People's Food Co-op, the
Produce Station, Harvest Kitchen, the Homegrown Fes-
tival, the Jolly Pumpkin - inAnn Arbor, the list of places
where residents can buy and eat locally grown food goes
on and on. But is it as easy for residents of other cities to
buy community-based agriculture? And how affordable
is this lifestyle?
Take two Michigan communities: Ann Arbor and Pon-
tiac. Residents of Ann Arbor tend to be wealthy and white.
With a population of 113,934, 73 percent of residents are
white, the median income for a family is $71,293 and only
4.6 percent of families are below the poverty line, accord-
ing to the U.S. Census Bureau. Pontiac, on the other hand,
is a less wealthy city made up of more minorities. Pontiac
has a population of 59,515, of which S1.1 percent are Afri-
can American, 26.6 percent are white and 16.5 percent
are Hispanic or Latino. The median income of a family is
only $36,391 with 18 percent of families living below the
poverty line.
Comparing the two cities, local food options are dras-
tically different. Ann Arbor offers dozens of regional
food options year-round, including grocery stores, mar-
kets, restaurants and cafes where patrons can buy and
eat local.
Looking for local food in Pontiac? Good luck. Two
small grocery stores feature "Market" in their name
and sell some produce from nearby farms, but for a true
farmers' market or restaurants featuring dishes from
community farms, Pontiac residents would have to
commute to affluent neighboring communities such as
Rochester or Birmingham.
Even if Pontiac did offer the cornucopia of choices seen
in Ann Arbor, it is unlikely that Pontiac residents could
bear the price tag that often goes along with local pro-
duce. However, the prices are not exorbitantly expensive
- at the Ann Arbor Farmers Market, a dozen eggs can
be bought for $3, 8 pounds of potatoes for $4 and a head
of lettuce for $2. Still, this is more expensive than buy-
ing similar products at Meijer where a dozen eggs is only
$1.68, 8 pounds of potatoes are $2.30 and a head of lettuce
is $1.29. A few dollars in savings can go a long way for low
income residents.
Perhaps economically struggling people would resort
to the even cheaper $1 McDouble hamburger at McDon-
ald's or 89 cents cheesy double beef burrito at Taco Bell,
which are not local or healthy, yet they flaunt a much
more affordable bill for impecunious residents of Pon-
tiac. This dilemma was recently looked at by researchers
at the University of Washington who found that nutrient-
dense, low-calorie foods are pricier than their high-fat,
unhealthy counterparts. Additionally, each year nutri-

ent-dense foods are becoming more expensive at a quick-
er rate than the calorie-packed foods. With this price
discrepancy, we can only expect people with financial
problems to become more reliant on cheap, unhealthy
food like McDonald's and Taco Bell.
Yes, buying local food has its benefits, including sup-
porting the regional economy, knowing where your food
comes from, lessening your environmental impact and,
depending on the person, even enjoying better tasting
food. However, locally grown food options tend to be
not only more expensive, but also simply not present in
slightly poorer communities. Cities like Pontiac should
look to expand local food options and offer this food at
equal or lower prices to grocery stores. To make food
affordable, local farms could accept food stamps, make
donations to food pantries, encourage community pro-
grams where people can volunteer on farms and receive
food in exchange for their services or the government
could offer subsidies to lower prices.
Pontiac, and other cities in similar situations, can
also turn to Detroit as a model for improvement. In
addition to farmers' markets and local food vendors,
Detroit has spearheaded an urban farms initiative. One
of these farms, the D-Town Farm, is 4 acres and grows
35 kinds of fruit and vegetables. Planted by volunteers,
the farm helps feed a community and bring people
together. Farms like this make Detroit a progressive city
when it comes to providing affordable alternative food
options to its residents. Urban farms are bringing jobs,
healthy local produce and a better environment to the
struggling city of Detroit.
Would a similar program succeed in Pontiac? For
urban farms like those in Detroit to expand to other
poverty-stricken areas, word needs to spread about
the benefits of urban farms. Through schools, commu-
nity programs and media, the success of urban farms in
Detroit should be stressed to residents of other strug-
gling areas. This will create a demand, and once Pontiac
residents want these farms, the farms are more likely
to succeed.
Though the situation in Detroit is looking up, let us not
forget Pontiac. Pontiac is only one example of an econom-
ically struggling community that offers few local food
options due to both availability and affordability. There
are many more cities in Michigan and across the country
in similar situations where residents have no option but
to buy unhealthy imported food. Cities should start look-
ing to Detroit as an example and make local food afford-
able not just for the affluent, but for all.

Black Keys rev it up

Band learns to walk
'El Camino' on
latest smash
By KAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
SeniorArts Editor
As Dan Auerbach howls, "I
got a love that keeps me waiting"
in "Lonely Boy," fans of Akron's
finest (sorry,
Lebron) realize
how lucky they
are to have a The Black
love that doesn't
- it's been a Keys
mere 18 months El Camino
since the Black
Keys dropped Nonesuch
Brothers, and
their new album El Camino marks
their third release since 2008.
The breadth to which their fan
base has grown is as remarkable
as their work ethic - with the
Black Keys as the last vestiges of
unadulterated, plug-it-in-and-jam
rock'n'roll, it's clear why jabronies
and housewives rock out to them
with equal abandon.
But don't believe Auerbach's
wails of being lonely for a sec-
ond. The days of him and drum-
mer Patrick Carney cranking out
tunes in abandoned factories are

long gone, and with a little help
from their friends - a scorching
bassist, booming backup singers
and virtuoso producer Danger
Mouse - the Black Keys have
crafted the tightest record in
their arsenal.
El Camino turns on the after-
burners from its first track, going
from zero to 80 within the open-
ing licks of the boisterous "Lonely
Boy." Melding a firecracker of a
riff with smashing set work by
Carney, the song nails the one
thing the Black Keys had always
been missing - music that gets
people to bust a move.
The Black Keys maintain this
level of amplified energy through-
out the album - it's still their
signature soul and freewheeling
vivacity, taken with a few cases of
Red Bull. "Dead and Gone" drives
relentlessly, pulsating with the
harmony of a mighty chorus. The
followingtrack, "Gold onthe Ceil-
ing" is a24-carat cut of blues rock,
featuring lacerating riffs and
searing, Jack White-esque solos.
The band has racked up a lot
of mileage, prompting El Camino
to sputter in a few songs. "Hell
of a Season" and "Sister" lie
among the pack of fairly forget-
table tracks, spearheaded by the
unbearably screechy "Run Right
Back." The missteps aren't as

lethal as the sleepiness that sunk
their last collaboration with Dan-
ger Mouse, Attack and Release,
but the band still has some fine-
tuning to do before completing
an immortal album.
El Camino is buoyed by "Little
Black Submarine," the rare song
in the collection in which the
band stops to catch its breath
- albeit a brief one. Auerbach
begins with a heart-wrenching
serenade, emotive yet uncom-
plicated, before launching into

"Happy Endings" had a rough
start last year, as it tried to reju-
venate the tired sitcom setup of a
group of young
adults living ****.
in nonsensi-
cally spacious Happy
apartments in End
a big city. Nev-
ertheless, the Season Two
show managed Midseason
to attract a
cult following, Wednesdays
most likely due at19:30 p.m.
to the strong ABC
comedic back-
ground of its cast: Two members
are Upright Citizens Brigade
veterans (Adam Pally and Casey
Wilson), and Eliza Coupe gained
popularity as the wickedly insen-
sitive Dr. Denise "Jo" Mahoney
on "Scrubs." Even so, most crit-
ics were surprised when ABC
renewed "Happy Endings" for a
second season.
The start of the second season
proves this show truly deserved
its renewal. It sticks to a simple
yet effective formula, managing
to pair together any combination
of these characters and make it
work, something few shows pull
off in their early seasons.
"Happy Endings" is different
from the typical friends-in-the-
big-city sitcom in that there prob-
ably won't be any inter-ensemble
relationship drama or love tri-
angles. Max (Pally) is gay, Jane
(Coupe) and Brad (Damon Way-
ans Jr., "The Other Guys") are
married and Dave and Alex are
split for good (hopefully). Very
few sitcoms pull off trying out
romantic pairings of main char-
acters, but the writers of "Happy
Endings" don't have to worry
about these balancing issues.
Instead, they have the freedom
to bring on countless noteworthy

slamming,
"misunder- FX
stood" adoles-
cents (and their moms) to revel in
the desperately narcissistic jour-
ney to teen-queen social royalty.
A disappointingly dowdy and
tired Jaime Pressly ("My Name
is Earl") leads as Annie Watson,
* a naive conservative mother
to monster-in-a-training-bra
Sophie (Kristi Lauren, "Living
the Dream"). As her daughter's
nature is revealed to be one
halo short of angelic, Annie and
best friend Nikki (Katie Finner-
an, "You've Got Mail"), whose
daughter (Aisha Dee, "The Sad-
dle Club") is part of a terrible
teenage twosome, are faced with
an impossible mission: to punish
their children. Mocked by unin-
volved husbands, a smug uncle
and a snooty principal, Annie
and Nikki must rely on each
other in navigating the unchart-
ed territory of mother-daughter
relationships.
Though the intensely ste-
reotypical portrayal of a raging
teenage population is obviously
an intentional exaggeration, "I
Hate My Teenage Daughter"
falls short of social satire, lack-
ing the biting humor that makes
a viewer want to laugh along.
Instead, the characters' obses-
sions with reputation seem more
like a screenwriter's half-assed
attempt at mocking female inse-
curities. The sexist stereotypes
are endless: skimpy outfits, com-
plete lack of sports knowledge,
manic fixation on weight and
desperation for male attention.
Due to their lack of credibility,

Annie and Nikki fail to win over
viewers - their superficial antics
mirror the stereotypes repre-
sented in their daughters. Refer-
ring to each other as a "pathetic"
working mom and a "lazy, stay-
at-home whore," the women
voluntarily sacrifice their posi-
tions as respectable role models.
Because the mothers seem to
vie for acceptance just as much
as the teens, viewers (and the
characters) are unable to regard
anything the women say with
authority.
Yet the show does offer a fairly
consistent amount of typical sit-
com laughs, even if nothilarious-
ly creative. While Pressly seems
a bit unnatural in such a con-
servative role (the only playboy
Annie Watson gets on her knees
for is Jesus), Finneran glows
with a natural comedic timing.
Charming in her self-depreca-
tion, indulgence in desserts and
general oblivion, Nikki is the
perfect sidekick to her rather
plain best friend.
Nobody likes
a teenager,
anyway.
The two, dedicated to drown-
ing their daughters in dancing
parent-induced embarrassment,
provide a bouncy dynamic that
ushers in the majority of the
show's comedy. A necessary
break from the draining annoy-
ance that is the remaining cast,
the motherly duo deserves the
attention of a program otherwise
dedicated to the woes of teenage
girl-dom.
"I Hate My Teenage Daugh-
ter" presents two important les-
sonsthat all (especiallyyou, FOX)
must learn: First, there's nothing
- not even a manicured adoles-
cent witch - that can't be fixed
with a healthy dose of embar-
rassment. Second, if the deci-
sion is made to title a program,
"I Hate My Teenage Daughter,"
don't be surprised when the audi-
ence hates her, too.

Freshmen pace Blue

EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Writer
If you told Michigan coach
Red Berenson that two fresh-
men would lead his team in goals
through the first two months of
the season, he likely would have
given you the patented Berenson
grin and perhaps even a little
chuckle.
After all, senior captains David
Wohlberg and Luke Glendening,
as well junior forwards Chris
Brown and A.J. Treais, were sup-
posed to do the bulk of the scor-
ing - especially with a third of
the roster experiencing its first
season of college hockey.
At first, Lindsay Sparks looked
like he was going to be a major
offensive weapon for the young
Wolverines. The junior forward
led the team with five goals in
the team's first six games, but he
hasn't scored since Oct. 27.
Wohlberg has picked it up
recently, scoring two goals in the
last three games, but that was
preceded by a seven-game point-
less streak.
Glendening's forte has never
been goal scoring - he's much
more of a two-way player. Still,
his goal production leaves some-
thing to be desired. Besides a
hat trick against St. Lawrence,
he has scored just two goals and
has recorded only one point since
Oct. 22.
The offense has stayed afloat
because of the kids.
Freshman forwards Phil Di
Giuseppe and Alex Guptill are
tied for the lead the team in
goals with eight apiece, and Di
Giuseppe is tied for the team lead
in points scored with 14.
"It's great freshmen can come
in like this and make this tran-
sition and be productive," said
Berenson. "But you never know
who is going to step up."

The 3-point shot is the bread
and butter of Michigan coach
John Beilein's offense.
So when senior guard Stu
Douglass and junior guard Matt
Vogrich, both prolific shooters,
committed to the Wolverines out
of high school, both were expect-
ed to complement Beilein's sys-
tem like butter on bread
Douglass, a two-star recruit on
Scout.com, was one of Beilein's
first two signees, joining for-
mer center and current student
assistant Ben Cronin. Though
his overall talent was considered
subpar, he shot 45 percent from
3-point range in high school.
"Two really important areas
that we needed were a young
man who could shoot the ball
and someone who could really
rebound the ball and pass it from
the center position," Beitein said
in 2008 when the pair signed
their letters of intent. "Ben and
Stu fit those needs."
Vogrich was also an unher-
alded recruit until the summer
before his senior year, when his
shooting in AAU tournaments
caught the. eyes of coaches and
scouts, eventually propelling him
to four-star status.
His Scout.com recruiting pro-
file listed his strengths as "3-point,
range" and "perimeter shot," and
his weaknesses were "ball han-
dling" and "strength." Questions
surrounding Vogrich's athleti-
cism still remain, making him a
liability as a defender as well.
While Vogrich and Douglass's
styles of play aren't identical -
Douglass, unlike Vogrich, has
the capability to play point guard
and is better defensively - their
roles are essentially limited to
Stig.mot he ree So
what happens when the shoot-

ers are having trouble shooting?
This season, Douglass is shoot-
ing a meager 27.8 percent from
long range. But even that doesn't
sound too bad compared to
Vogrich's paltry 8.3 percent. His
lone 3-pointer came 11 minutes
into Michigan's third game of the
season. He's made just two bas-
kets since, and his minutes have
dwindled.
Beilein sounds puzzled as he
tries to explain why two sharp
shooters can't find the bottom of
the net from beyond the arc.
"There's not much you can do,"
Beilein said after Saturday's win
oyer towaState. "They're either
hurrying or pressing. I've been
there before, I've watched it with
iy own son.'
But the coach, who has seen
manytalentedshootersgo though
slumps, emphasized that his con-
fidence hasn't waivered with
regards to their shot selection.'
"For their own attitudes, I
want them to just know that they
still have the green light when
they're open because that's the
type of shooters that they are,"
Beilein said.
Mechanics aren't an issue.
Both possess pure shots that
leaves fans wondering how they
ever miss - somethingthey rare-
ly do in pregame shootarounds.
Freshman guard Trey Burke
had the same thing to say about
the pair in practice.
"Practice is night and day
(compared to games)," Burke
said. "They hit (their 3-pointers)
in practice."
Just three weeks ago, Michi-
gan's storyline surrounded a
point guard controversy between
Douglass and Burke.
But since Burke took over the
starting role in the second game
of the season, he's averaging nine
gor us per thy;4he
veteran. Douglass played just 16

minutes against the Cyclones
- the second-lowest total since
January of his freshman year, and
lowest since last year's season-
opening 31-point win over USC
Upstate.
But the matchup with Iowa
State was significantly more com-
petitive than the blowout over
the Spartans, showing Douglass's
minutes have truly taken a hit.
Beilein even suggested that junior
guard Eso Akunne, who played 12
minutes on Saturday, may contin-
ue to see a rise in his minutes. The
former walk-on hasn't missed a
3-pointer yet this season, and has
made a shot from deep in three of
the past four games.
Douglass is a senior who has
shown he can overcome adver-
sity - remember, he wasn't sup-
posed to be talented enough to
play, let alone start, on a Big Ten
roster. The Carmel, Ind. product
has gone through ups and downs
throughout his career and has an
established mental toughness.
But the more inexperienced
Vogrich hasn't yet shown he
can overcome adversity. In fact,
Burke said his teammate's confi-
dence maybe waning.
As the two shooters continue
to struggle, it's up to the team's
leaders to keep their confidence
high. Beilein's support came as
no surprise, but Burke is already
demonstrating that he can utilize
his newfound role as the "quar-
terback" of the team, as Beilein
likes to say - proving thathis play
on the court isn't the only attri-
bute that seems beyond his years.
"(Vogrich) misses some shots
and he kind of gets down on him-
self," Burke said. "I think it's just
a comfort level (issue). ... On the
break when he's wide open, you
just know it'sgoing in but it might
go in and go out.
";ust tell him, 'Keep shooting,
keep shooting."'

THE LITTLE BLUE BOOK
WHEN A NEW PASSPORT
SAYING GOODBYE TO CH
BY MONICA KUSAKA H ERRERO

L ast year I had to renew my
passport. It was a sad day
when I received my new, crisp
and untouched little blue book.
It's not that I don't like change -
I've had my fair share of change
in life so far - it's just that my old
passport was so well worn. It had
visas. It had character. It had the
dust of five different continents on
it. I was so proud of my stamp col-
lection, and the new one didn't do
justice to what I knew as my life so
far.
I've been fortunate enough to
have not only traveled out of the
country, but to have come from
an international family (as crazy
as they are) and live abroad. In
2003, my family made our first
big move to Tokyo, Japan. I was in
seventh grade, and in my middle

school prime - not the ideal time
to move halfway across the world.
But when my parents proposed the
move, my sisters and I were sur-
prisingly game for an enormous
life change despite the fact that
we never really had a strong inter-
est in our Japanese heritage. I did
have two Japanese names, I looked
half-Japanese and my grandmoth-
er's cooking was occasionally Jap-
anese inspired, but otherwise, we
were not well-acquainted with the
culture and we definitely did not
speak the language.
We moved in July 2003, and I
spent the rest of the summer get-
ting lost around our neighbor-
hood, repeating "Irashaimase"
("Welcome to our store") back
to the understandably confused
store attendants and participat-

When you move around as
much as I have, with a mother who
is constantly trying to get you to
downsize and throw away non-
essentials from your childhood,
a passport means a lot more than
just a form of legal documentation.
For someone who isn't so artisti-
cally inclined, a passport becomes
a scrapbook of life's memories. The
stamps serve as souvenirs of the
incredible opportunities I have
been lucky enough to have and the
empty pages pushing me toward
future adventures.

that was very tragic," Butter said.

The Swiss government prohibited
Butter from staying with her fam-
ily in the hospital. She was homeless
and she was taken a displaced per-
son's camp in Algiers, Switzerland,
where she remained until the war
ended in May1945.
Butter eventually headed for
America on her own, and her broth-
er and mother joined her the follow-
ing year.
Butter thrived in America. When
she arrived to the University and
started working at the School of
Public Health, she was approached
by Jamie Catlin, then manager for
foundation relations at the Uni-
versity's development office, about
developing an endowment fund in
Wallenberg's name.
At first, she said they hoped
that Wallenberg was still alive and
would one day be able to receive the
award. But as time passed and cer-
tainty of his death increased, the
shift focused to inspiring citizens to
embark on humanitarian initiatives.

"The main goal was for people
to learn more about (Wallenberg),
especially students and the Ann
Arbor community, and so there was
a lot of deliberation on what would
be the best way to do it ... so that he
would serve as a role model for this
community and the model that we
used was that one person can make
a difference," Butter said.
Butter spent five years helping
to amass approximately $500,000
in funding before awarding the
medal to the first recipient in 1990,
Ellie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor
and award-winning author who
has done vast work in advocating
human rights.
Butter said the program's intent
is to inspire people to make a differ-
ence in their community, no matter
how minute the impact may seem.
"We have to be vigilant, and be
aware of the persecution, discrimi-
nation, prejudice and suffering of
other people and try to do what we
can to help, Butter said. "... So many
people think the problems are so
huge, and I'm so small ... but that's
not true. You can always make a dif-
ference at some level. "
THE BETTERMENT OF
HUMANKIND

John Godfrey, assistant dean for
international education at Rack-
ham Graduate School and chair of
the Wallenberg Committee, said
Wallenberg embodies the spirit of
many University students seeking
to get involved in humanitarian
efforts.
Godfrey added that Wallen-
berg's vigor and voracious appetite
for academia translated to his fight
against the Nazis.
"What he brought to that cri-
sis was in a way that aptitudes he
brought to Ann Arbor when he
came here as an undergraduate,
which was his resilience, determi-
nation, openness and creativity in
the face of challenge," Godfrey said.
According to Godfrey, Wallen-
berg's story is an important exam-
ple of how to extend classroom
experiences to the world and how to
use knowledge from the University
for the betterment of humankind.
"Raoul Wallenberg is kind of a
mythic prototype for this kind of
an individual who's learning and
whose commitment is not circum-
scribed by the classroom itself,"
Godfrey said. "But who is phased
out into the world and who wants
to engage the world with what he's
learned, and that was Wallenberg at
Michigan."

MICHIGAN MAN OF
THE WORLD
How Raoul Wallenberg took on the Nazis
and saved thousands of lives
By Bethany Biron
. . .. . .. ..... . .... . .. .. .. .. . .. .. ... .. .. . .. .. .. . ..

Welcome to the Random Stu-
dent Interview, where we push
the boundaries of desperation.
Hey do you have a minute?
OK.
You don't sound too convincing.
Do you really have a minute?</
strong>
Yeah. I mean, I should be doing
everything else.
What do you mean by "every-
thing else?"
Oh, you know. Finals are next
week.
What's the damage?
Not too bad. This one class is kill-
ing me. I have one final, paper and
two presentations due.
Damn. How will you ever get
through?
Well,I have to find someone to buy
me Adderall. No, give me Adder-
all. I don't have any money, and I
heard 5-Hour Energy tastes like
shit.
And Adderall tastes like what?

I don't know, I've never had it
before, but I hear it does cool
things. Wait, my friend gave me
some of her ADHD medication
one time, but I don't know how it
tastes because I ate it with chick-
en shawarma. Anyway, that's my
story.
So I take it we are in desperate
territory.
Yeah, good thing I'm not an engi-
neering major. Or pre-med. By the
way, did you know that the profes-
sion you're most likely to kill your-
self in is a 7-Eleven store clerk?
No way.
Yeah. I had a friend who worked
at 7-Eleven, and I haven't talked to
him in a few months and now I'm
afraid he's probably dead.
You jump to hasty conclusions
don't you?
I'm a pretty pessimistic person. I
see life on the dark side. I mean,
I've seen the dark side of life.
OK, let's try to get to the bright

side. What about break? Do you
have any plans?
I mean, my parents did suggest
going to Maine, which sounds way
worse than Michigan, so I said no.
So I'm stuck here.
Oh no, what will you do in Mich-
igan?
Hopefully I can get a job for next
semester, but not at 7-Eleven.
They're hiring. Sorry to anyone
that works there.
Have you applied anywhere
more promising?
Yeah, but it's probably too fancy
for me. I shouldn't name-drop. I
want to get hired.
Good policy. What do you want
to make money for? Spend it all
on holiday gifts?
Well, I want to go somewhere for
my 21st birthday. I don't really
care about other people.
Well, as long as we're being hon-
est, what's your position on the
phrase "Happy Holidays"?

I think it's the right position. It's
a universal phrase. When you say
"Happy Holidays" to someone,
they know what you mean.
And what do you mean?
Have a happy holiday.
Well that's easy.
Also, you won't get anyone yell-
ing at you. Like if you say "Merry
Christmas," sometimes people
yell at you.
Why do you think that is?
People are angry.
How about you? Are you angry?
I would have to say no. Just a little
depressed about the prospect of
finals, but overall I'm good.
Does next semester look any
more promising for you?
If I don't get off the wait list for
this class, then no. I'll have class
at eight in the morning.
Yeah, at that point, you might as
well apply at 7-Eleven.

Among the Arthur Millers and Gerald
Fords to graduate from the University,
it's easy to overlook a young Swedish
businessman who single-handedly saved the
lives of thousands of Jews in the Holocaust.
His name is Raoul Wallenberg, and his
short life as a humanitarian ended with a
death veiled in mystery.
Wallenberg graduated with honors from
the University's architecture program in1935.
A member of a wealthy Swedish family, he
was urged by his grandfather to look beyond
his family's fortune and pursue a course of
study that exposed him to the world.
He quickly fell in love with America and
became infatuated with the people and land-
scape of the country. After spending the
academic year studying the art of develop-
ing buildings, Wallenberg spent the summer
breaks hitchhiking across North America,
enthralled with the foreign lifestyle, accord-
ing to Scott Ellsworth, a lecturer in the Uni-
versity's Department of Afroamerican and
African Studies and leader of a campus group
that raises awareness about Wallenberg.
A MICHIGAN MAN
At the University, Wallenberg was popular
among his classmates and was lauded for his
gentlemanly demeanor.
Ellsworth shared a storywhenWallenberg
rode his bike to the home of a classmate's
mother, 50 miles north of Ann Arbor to have
tea with her women's society and discuss
European affairs.
"He makes this appearance, and every-
body falls in love with him," Ellsworth said.
"He was just this straight up guy who would
deliver."
When Wallenberg graduated from the
University, he returned to Sweden "with a
heavy heart" in hopes of securing an archi-
tectural position back home, Ellsworth said.
The Great Depression had recently hit, and
the effects were felt worldwide - making
Wallenberg's job hunt challenging.
He began working as a sales representa-
tive, and his work required frequent travel to
Central Europe, including Germany, where
Adolf Hitler had already taken over power.
Wallenberg found himself frequently brush-
ing shoulders with Nazi officials.
A SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY
As a non-Jew and Swedish citizen - a neu-
tral country in World War II - Wallenberg

was still able to travel and continue with his
business affairs, particularly assisting clients
wli'ocouldn't do business in Nazi controlled
countries - including a Jewish businessman
in Sweden who was unable to travel to his
business in Hungary after it became aligned
with Nazi Germany.
Hungary's alliance with Nazi Germany led
to a series of large-scale murders that ravaged
the countryside and killed 400,000 Jews in
six months.
The remaining Jews left in Hungary were
concentrated in Budapest, and the United
States decided to intervene.
According to Ellsworth, the United States
Office of Strategic Services began searching
for a diplomat who could use American fund-
ing to bribe Nazi officials in Budapest to pro-
tect the Jewish community. A tip led them to
Wallenberg after they heard about his work
assisting Jewish clients, and OSS officials
asked the Swedish government if Wallenberg
could work as a liaison with their organiza-
tion.
Soon, Wallenberg was headed to Budapest
with diplomatic credentials and a pocket full
of American money.
This time it wasn't for a business deal, but
to fight Nazis.
Wallenberg's first course of action was
to purchase between 30 to 40 apartments
and townhouses throughout Hungary, atop
which he installed Swedish flags to disguise
them as diplomatic safe havens.
He then began funneling Jews into the
homes while concurrently working with the
Nazis to ensure the diplomatic immunity of
the safe houses.
However, Wallenberg couldn't prevent
the resurgence of violence as fascist groups
began killing Jews on the streets of Budapest.
Ellsworth said one of the fascists' favorite
practice was to tie groups of Jewish citizens
together, kill the ones in the middle of the
group, and throw them into the Danube River
to drown.
Once Wallenberg heard of the attacks, he
quickly intervened by producing counterfeit
Swedish passports for the Jews so they would
be legally protected.
A HUNTED MAN
Amid the bribery of Nazi officers and coun-
terfeit passports, Wallenberg's life became
increasingly threatened.
"He became a hunted man," Ellsworth
said. "He went from house to house every

night, sleeping with a revolver under his pil-
low."
As the war came to a close, the European
railroad system became so dilapidated from
wartime attacks that Nazi officials began
leading "death marches" to transport the
Jews by foot hundreds of miles to concentra-
tion camps across Europe.
To aid the ailing Jews on these marches,
Wallenberg began providing the traveling
Jews with food and medical supplies, bribing
his way past Nazi guards to assist the wound-
ed and sick. He also shared escape methods.
His kindness was so moving, that when
instructed to shoot him, many of the Nazi
officers purposely misaimed, Ellsworth said.
When the Soviet army entered the out-
skirts of Budapest to liberate the city from
the Nazis, Wallenberg spoke with the Russian
authorities, presenting himself as a Swedish
diplomat living in Budapest, to voice his con-
cerns over the inhumane treatment of the
Jews on the death marches.
It was the last time he was ever seen.
There are various conspiracies about the
whereabouts of Wallenberg. Though the
Soviets announced in 1957 that he had been
kidnapped and made a prisoner of war in Rus-
sia, some say that he died of a heart attack in
1947 while under Soviet custody. Many histo-
rians say the real truth may never be known.

A MISSION TO TELL
WALLENBERG'S STORY
Despite his disappearance, his legacy as a
great humanitarian persists.
Ellsworth said he became interested in
Wallenberg during the summer of 2009 while
he worked at Camp Michigania - a camp
sponsoredby the University's Alumni Associ-
ation for alumni and their families - and led
a session on notable alumni, like Wallenberg,
with former Michigan football coach, Lloyd
Carr.
Ellsworth's determination to raise aware-
ness aboutWallenberg was solidified duringa
trip to Rome lastyear when he heard a retired
scientist's story of Holocaust survival. The
man survived thanks to a mysterious diplo-
mat who helped him and his mother escape
from Nazi-controlled Budapest.
The story drew Ellsworth's mind immedi-
ately to Wallenberg and convinced him that
the Swede's story must be told.
When he returned to Ann Arbor, Ells-
worth teamed up with current and former
students to create a group dedicated to mak-
ing Wallenberg's story known among stu-
dents. Ellsworth - along with LSA juniors
Sarah Thomas, a former Michigan Daily staff
reporter, and Becca Denenberg - has been

people were so excited."
The night before the rally, the Legisla-
ture passed the revised marijuana policy,
drastically reduciog the peoalties for use,
possession sod sale of the drug. Aod -
fioally - three days after the rally, the
Michigan Supreme Court ordered Sin-
clair to be released from prison.
" Iwas an opponent, I had to take a few
licks on the way to winning the fight,"
Sinclair said, when asked if he felt like he
had been a victim of the state's marijuana
laws. "If I had to have done 10 years, I
would've been a victim.
"But then John Lennon got me out, and
I won. Not too many people can say that."
It's impossible to say, though, what.the
ultimate effect the Freedom Rally had on
the Supreme Court's Decision to release
Sinclair, Conforth said.
"I think there was enough public senti-
ment growing without the concert that he,
in all likelihood, would've been released
anyway because people were increasingly
seeing it as a bum rap," Conforth said.
Fenton added that Sinclair's sentence
could've been shorter, but he insisted on
fighting the government's classification
of marijuana as an addictive narcotic.
"John could've gotten out of jail a lot
earlier, and could've avoided many, many,
many months of abuse in prison, and har-
rowing periods of solitary confinement,
but ... he wouldn't compromise," Fenton
said.
And the court went even further. In
March 1972, it ruled Michigan's marijua-
na laws unconstitutional, and since the
revised law that was passed the previous
December didn't go into effect until April
1, open consumption of marijuana was
legal in Michigan for about three weeks
that spring.
Sinclair said he led events around Ann
Arbor where people openly smoked weed,
adding that the party also started its own
church.
"Marijuana and psychedelic drugs
were our sacraments," Sinclair said. "So,
we were having open church services
where we were sharing the sacraments at
- the altar and all this kind of stuff."
Then, on April 1, when the new law
took effect, the first Hash Bash was held
on the Diag "to let them know that we'd
still be smoking even though they were
putting this law back in," Sinclair said.
40 years later
Today, Ann Arbor is a much different
city than it was when Sinclair and the
White Panthers called it home, as luxury
high-rise apartment buildings continue to
sprout up around campus, and franchised
coffee shops and drugstores fill up State
Street and South University Avenue.
"In hindsight, people like to remember
things as having more importance than
they actually did because it's what gives
our lives meaning," Conforth said. "A lot
of what happened back then was due to
happenstance, due to political manipula-

tions. You know, we may never know in all
sorts of ways, not just with Sinclair, but in
all sorts of ways."
Still, Sinclair and the White Panthers
have left an indelible impact on Ann
Arbor. Hash Bash still takes place every
April, and the People's Food Co-op in
Kerrytown, which the residents of Hill
Street established, still exists.
Beyond that, graying hippies still hap-
pily share stories of their exploits during
the era and talk about the night the for-
mer Beatle came to Ann Arbor.
Now 70 years old, Sinclair says he still
smokes at least two joints each day. He
saysahe sees parallels betweendhis politi-
cal advocacy in the 1960s and '70s and
the Occupy Wall Street movement that is
reinvigorating the left today.
"I've been doing this for a long time,
but man, it's exhilarating to see other
people, young people, find this out," Sin-
clair said. "It took them a long time, but
on Sept. 17, 2011, they said, 'Wait a minute,
this has gone too far.' Now I don't know
what's going to happen, but I'm kind of
exhilarated."
He continued, "It's picking up from 40
years ago and starting to go to the next
step."

t was past 3 a.m. - more than eight
hours after the show started - by
the time John Lennon and Yoko Ono
took the stage at Crisler Arena wear-
ing matching magenta T-shirts and
leather jackets.
A wary crowd of 15,000 erupted for the
two'60s heroes as a haze of marijuana smoke
hung over the arena floor. Lennon's appear-
ance was the capstone of the John Sinclair
Freedom Rally - a mega concert to benefit
jailed left-wing activist John Sinclair, one of
the founders of the White Panther Party.
"We came here not only to help John and
to spotlight what's going on, but also to show
and to say to all of you that apathy isn't it,
and we can do something," Lennon told the
audience. "OK, so flower power didn't work,
so what? We start again."
In July 1969, Sinclair was sentenced to 9.5
to 10 years in prison for selling two joints to
an undercover narcotics officer. The Free-
dom Rally, held on Dec. 10, 1971 - 40 years
ago this Saturday - was the culmination of
more than two years of efforts to free Sin-
clair.
In an interview while sipping coffee at the
Starbucks on East Liberty Street last Satur-
day, Sinclair said the Ann Arbor rally wasn't
an isolated event.
"Every week there was something some-
where, and sometimes there were fairly big
ones," he said. "But this one, for December
10, 1971, was scheduled to be as big as we
could make it."
An astonishing mix of activists and art-
ists gathered in Ann Arbor that Friday night
to put pressure on the Michigan Supreme
Court to finally release Sinclair. Bobby Seale,
co-founder of the Black Panther Party, activ-
ist Jerry Rubin and the poet Allen Ginsberg
all spoke, while Stevie Wonder, Bob Seger,
Teegarden & Van Winkle and Phil Ochs per-
formed.
Sinclair himself even spoke from prison -
via phone - to the rally.
Still, Lennon was the headliner.
"(Lennon) just put it over the top," Sin-
clair said. "All the tickets sold out in three
minutes. It was the fastest selling ticket in
Michigan pop music history, and that just
put the focus on my case and the issue."
The Ann Arbor performance was Lennon's
first since The Beatles broke up the previous
year. Lennon was only on stage for about 15
minutes, playing three songs including one
called "John Sinclair" he wrote specifically
for the occasion.
"Won't you care for John Sinclair? /In the
stir for breathing air," Lennon sang, as Ono
stood to his right playing a bongo. "Let him
be / set him free / let him be like you and me.
/ They gave him ten for two."
And that Monday, Dec. 13, Sinclair was set
free.
T HE H IL L ST RE E T
COMM U NE
Sinclair was a major player in Detroit in
his early years, managing the politically

active band MC5, contributing to several
underground publications and creating the
Detroit Artists Workshop. But after the 1967
riots, police began to crack down on citizens,
and in May 1968, Sinclair decided to make
the move to liberal Ann Arbor.
Sinclair and his friends settled into large
houses at the corner of Hill Street and
Washtenaw Avenue, creating for themselves
a hippie commune that totaled about 35 peo-
ple.
When they first got to Ann Arbor, Sinclair
said the hippies stuck out from University
students.
"The rest of Ann Arbor was pretty much
students with short hair, student garb -
squares," Sinclair said. "We were like sore
thumbs walking among the students. Stu-
dents didn't like hippie chicks because they
didn't have brassieres on and stuff like that.
They didn't shave under their arms and (the
students) thought they were scum. They
would verbally attack them on the street. It
wasn't very pleasant."
It was on Hill Street where Sinclair began
to mobilize politically. The commune liked
to put on free concerts in the band shell at
Ann Arbor's West Park on Sunday evenings
in the summer.
Ann Arbor denied them a permit, but Sin-
clair decided to proceed with the show any-
way - a moment he called the "fulcrum" in
their transformation into a political group.
"We defied the law," Sinclair said. "That
was a political act. We defied the law. We
rented a generator for $8, got 50 cents worth
of gas and set up in the pavilion in West Park
and we played. Nobody came because we
coudhn't advertise it because it was a guer-
rilla action, but we did it."
Pun Plamondon, another member of the
commune who would later be charged with
bombing a CIA office in Ann Arbor, said the
Sunday concerts were a tremendous oppor-
tunity for the group to spread their message,
even though other groups like the Students
for a Democratic Society questioned their
techniques.
"We were reaching 2,000 people every
Sunday, and we're passing out leaflets, and
we're having speakers speak between the
bands and we're organizing and agitating,"
Plamondon said. "If (SDS) printed 150 fly-
ers and handed them out on campus, they
thought they were organizing, but we'd say,
'that ain't nothin', man."'
The movement began in earnest when
Plamondon showed Sinclair an interview
with Huey Newton of the Black Panther
Party. In the interview, Newton was calling
for a White Panther Party.
Sinclair bought into the idea, and the
group - modeled after the Black Panthers
and another radical group called the Yip-
pies, which was headed by Jerry Rubin and
Abbie Hoffman - began to form.
"I felt that we needed a combination of the
discipline, organization and ideology of the
Black Panther Party, along with the theat-
rics and the media manipulation of the Yip-
pies," Plamondon said.
The White Panther Party was founded
on a 10-point program modeled after that of

the Black Panthers, and the White Panthers'
first point was complete support of the Black
Panthers' platform.
The rest of the manifesto focused on free
and total access to common goods such as
food, clothes and housing, the elimination
of money and the end of war. The statement
also advocated for "total assault on the cul-
ture by any means necessary, including rock
and roll, dope and fucking in the streets."
Sinclair "talked a hell of a good game" in
terms of advocating for the movement, says
American Culture Prof. Bruce Conforth,
adding that the White Panthers advocated
for what they believed in, but their beliefs
were often based on "flights of fancy."
"But, you know - and I hate to put it in
these terms because it tends to trivialize it -
but they were still about sex, drugs and rock
'n' roll," Conforth said. "The philosophy was
all about sloganism and catch phrases - and
they were really good at that."

After Sinclair was sentenced on July 28,
1969, the movement turned political. The
White Panthers began to actively campaign
to get Sinclair and other prisoners released.
Though he was incarcerated, Sinclair said
he still guided the movement from his prison
cell. When he had access to his typewriter,
Sinclair would write seven-page, single-
spaced letters to other leaders, and he'd get
news from his wife Leni and brother David,
also leaders of the party, when they came to
visit him in prison.
"I had nothing else to do so I was con-
stantly involved in this," Sinclair said. "Plus,
it took me out of my prison surroundings.
Mentally, I was somewhere else. I was doing
something for myself. I was doing something
to advance our political, social and cultural
goals. So, I was very, very much involved -
both in planning activities and events, and
debating strategy and tactics."
While Sinclair was in jail, the White
Panthers - who renamed themselves the
Rainbow People's Party - worked to raise
awareness about their leader's plight.
Hoffman even interrupted The Who's
performance at Woodstock, stealing the
microphone from Pete Townshend to talk
about Sinclair.
David Fenton, who worked as the publish-
er of the group's newspaper, the Ann Arbor
Sun, and now runs an international com-
munications firm, said Sinclair taught him
everything he knows about PR.
"I learned it all doing that work," Fen-
ton said. "Sinclair used to write me long,
detailed, handwritten, yellow legal pad
letters from prison about how to organize
media coverage about how to get him out of
jail. He was a genius at this stuff."
But come December 1971, a rally was
planned to coincide with a bill that was
making its way through the Michigan Leg-
islature. The bill would change the state's
drug laws by delisting marijuana as a nar-

cotic, have a maximum 90-day sentence for
use and only up to one year for possession of
the drug.
Sinclair said they wanted to ensure the
Legislature voted on the bill before adjourn-
ing for the Christmas holiday.
"We (had) to do something to make it
impossible for the legislature to go home for
Christmas without voting," Sinclair said of
the bill. "If they say no, they say no, but we
wanted to at least make them vote."
A rally to free John Sinclair to be held in
Ann Arbor was planned for Dec. 10, and it
was shaping up to be like any of the count-
less other events that were held on Sinclair's
behalf over the previous two-and-a-half
years.
Then, on the night of Dec. 5, the event's
organizers got a phone call. It was Lennon.
"I just want to say we're coming along
to the John Sinclair bust fund rally to say
hello," Lennon said on the phone, accord-
ing to a Dec. 6, 1971 press release issued by
the organizers. "I won't be bringing a band
or nothing like that, because I'm only here
as a tourist, but I'll probably fetch me guitar,
as I know we have a song that we wrote for
John."
Rubin, the Yippie leader, was friends with
Lennon and had convinced him to take up
Sinclair's cause.
"Jerry Rubin became close friends with
John and Yoko when they lived in New York
and wanted to get into the things that were
going on, were of the moment," Sinclair said.
"They wanted to do whatever was happen-
ing, what was really cool - and so that was
us."
Despite his interest in Sinclair's case,
Lennon also probably had his own personal
motivations for coming to the rally, accord-
ing to Conforth. Lennon was in the process
of planning a potential American tour with
the Plastic Ono Band, and the Ann Arbor
concert would be a good way to ease back
into playing live shows.
"These were times when people served
their self-interests quite frequently, and
Lennon I don't think did it for purely altru-
istic reasons," Conforth said. "He didn't do
it just because of John Sinclair; he did it
because it would serve him well. In addition,
it would do something for (Sinclair)."
After the rally, Sinclair and Lennon dis-
cussed holding similar events at venues
around the country, following President
Richard Nixon as he campaigned for re-
election. The tour would have culminated
with a free, three-day festival in San Diego
- the proposed site of the 1972 Republican
National Convention.
The proposed tour never happened
because of Lennon's on-going immigration
troubles when the U.S. tried to deport him.
Still, in the days leading up to the Ann
Arbor event, organizers kicked their prepa-
rations into high gear. They had only a mat-
ter of days to prepare for what was quickly
becoming a much larger event than they had
initially planned, Fenton said.
"It was like God was coming to Ann
Arbor," Fenton said. "It was amazing. I
remember announcing it on the radio, and
