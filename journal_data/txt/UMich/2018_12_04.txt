Two groups staged protests 

Monday night outside Ann 
Arbor City Hall, calling on 
City Council to take action 
on 
disparate 
issues: 
the 

reopening of a piercing shop 

with a racist owner and the 
annual deer cull in Ann Arbor.

Protesters 
from 
BAMN 

and Stop Trump Ann Arbor 
demanded 
City 
Council 

take 
action 
against 
the 

reopening of Pangea Piercing, 
which closed in August after 
its owner, J.C. Potts, was 
accused white supremacism, 

sexism 
and 
inappropriate 

behavior by clients. 

BAMN 
organizer 
Kate 

Stenvig, 
a 
University 
of 

Michigan 
alum, 
said 
she 

wanted to increase awareness 
about Potts, especially now 
that he had reopened his 
store. 

“The first thing that we’re 

trying to do is spread the 
word that he’s back,” Stenvig 
said. “We’ve been passing out 
flyers outside of his place, we 
did a picket on Saturday and 
overwhelmingly people who 
come by are like, ‘Oh, my god, 
he’s back.’ On campus, too, 
people have heard about it 

The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs 
at 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
met 
Monday 

afternoon to discuss student 
efforts to reduce the effects of 
climate change on campus and 
hear several guest speakers 
including University President 
Schlissel.

The meeting opened as the 

assembly addressed Central 
Student Government’s recent 
resolution regarding climate 
change and their request for 
SACUA to support the goals of 
the resolution. The resolution 
calls for carbon neutrality by 
2035, intermediate emission 
reduction 
goals, 
increased 

funding 
and 
a 
Carbon 

Neutrality Commission made 
up of students, faculty and 
community 
members. 
The 

assembly discussed whether or 
not to agree with the resolution 
as a whole, or simply the goals 
CSG is putting forth with this 
legislation. Subsequently, the 
assembly voted unanimously 
in support of the principles

The 
Michigan 
Daily: 

In recent coverage, The Daily 
has highlighted the stories 
of people at the University 
who 
have 
had 
less 
than 

favorable experiences with 
the Office for Institutional 
Equity and the Title IX sexual 
misconduct reporting process 
as a whole. Do you believe the 
current Title IX reporting 
process is effective given 
these stories and, if so, will 
the Sixth Circuit ruling make 
it 
less 
effective 
in 
your 

opinion?

President Mark Schlissel: 

I think the OIE has a very 
difficult job to do across a 
very challenging landscape 
… I think they do a very 
good job in aggregate. I 
think our investigations and 
adjudications often take too 
long. That’s a problem we 
have to work hard to correct. 
We’re going to have to adjust 
to the implications of the 
Sixth ruling, which is a pretty 
significant 
change. 
We’re 

pretty close to having a new 
approach 
that’s 
consistent 

with the Sixth Circuit ruling 
that we’re going to roll out 
in the beginning of the new 
semester, 
and 
recognize 

that we’ve done this in an 
accelerated way with some 
consulting but not as much 
as we normally do because 
in effect we’re under a court 
order … The biggest thing I’m 
worried about is we know 
misconduct is underreported, 
and what we’re concerned 
about is changes we make in

Education at Hutchins Hall Monday evening.

About 50 students, professors attended event to write comments for Dept. of Education

In response to concerns with 

new Title IX regulations, about 
50 students and professors from 
the University of Michigan’s 
Institute 
for 
Research 
on 

Women and Gender, Law School 
and Department of Sociology 
hosted a Title IX comment 
writing event Monday night in 
Hutchins Hall Monday night.

Title IX of the Education 

Amendments of 1972 to the 1964 
Civil Rights Act was created to 
abolish discrimination based 
on sex in federally funded 
education 
programs. 
This 

policy is applied to public 
universities in order to prevent 
gender-based discrimination.

In 
2017, 
Secretary 

of 
Education 
Betsy 

DeVos withdrew much of the 
guidelines created to uphold 
the requirements of Title IX set 
by President Barack Obama’s 
administration. This fall, new 

regulations were proposed by 
the Department of Education. 
The comment writing event 
was held in order to highlight 
the 
regulatory 
changes 
as 

well as encourage students to 
participate in the notice and 
comment process. 

Nina Mendelson, a University 

Law 
School 
professor 

specializing in administrative 
law, said the comment writing 
process has a large impact on 
Title IX regulation decisions. 
According 
to 
Mendelson, 

educational departments set 
standards 
of 
conduct 
that 

institutions who receive federal 
funding must comply with. Such 
standards are most often in the 
form of a regulatory proposal. 
The law requires agencies to 
give notice to the public about 
what the proposal is and allow 
them to comment on it. Then, 
they have a legal obligation 
to review all comments and 
respond if there is a significant 
issue raised — they may decide 
to change the regulation in

The Michigan Prison Doula 

Initiative 
hosted 
a 
panel 

made up of seven formerly 
incarcerated 
people, 
health 

care professionals and MPDI 
staff Monday night to discuss 
insights on the intersections of 
reproductive justice and mass 
incarceration.

According to LSA junior 

Sitara Murali, the director 
for Community Outreach and 
Activism of the University 
of Michigan’s Prison Birth 
Project, as well as one of the 
organizers of the event, the 
purpose of the event was 
to bring the experiences of 
those exposed to the prison 
system to light and increase 
communication 
about 
the 

system as a whole. 

“Tonight’s 
event 
was 

basically a way for our student 
org, the Prison Birth Project, 
to highlight the experiences 
of people that have firsthand 
been involved in the prison 
systems,” Murali said. “Either

they worked there, or they 
work with populations –– 
women specifically –– that 
were incarcerated, and we 
just thought it was a really 
important 
conversation 
to 

bring to campus and something 
that a lot of people don’t have 
a lot of understanding about.”

 

The goal of MPDI is to 

“provide 
comprehensive 

childbirth 
education 
and 

professional doula services 
to women in Women’s Huron 
Valley Correctional Facility.” 
It collaborates with various 
organizations and encourages 
volunteer participation.

 Many of the panelists 

shared intimate experiences 
about their times in prison 
in which they felt personally 
impacted by injustices within 

the system. MPDI Executive 
Director Jacqueline Williams 
described 
the 
impact 
she 

hoped the panelists had on the 
attendees.

 “I hope what the panelists 

said 
today 
changes 
their 

perceptions of what people 
actually have to go through 
in prison,” Williams said. 
“There’s 
this 
conception 

that, 
‘Oh, 
they 
get 
fed 

three meals a day and all 
of their needs are attended 

to.’ And as you heard, 
it can sometimes take 
an 
enormous 
amount 

of 
agency 
and 
self-

advocacy 
to 
get 
even 

the 
most 
baseline 

accommodations.”

 Currently, the U.S. 

makes 
up 
about 
5 

percent of the world’s 
population. At the same 
time, 25 percent of the 
world’s prisoners reside 
in the U.S.

 In women’s prisons 

in the U.S., 85 percent 
of inmates are mothers 
and 
25 
percent 
were 

pregnant on arrest or 
gave birth within the last 
year. Based off of these 
statistics, Williams spoke 
about the most effective 
manner in which the 
U.S. should approach the 
issues within the prison 
system.

“When 
we 
think 

about health care and 
reproductive justice, it’s 
just 
unsustainable 
to 

think that we can provide 
adequate 
health 
care 

and progressive reproductive 
justice 
when 
we 
have 
so 

many people in prison and so 
many of those people are in 
prison for non-violent drug 
offenses,” 
Williams 
said. 

“There are alternatives to this 
that countries participate in 
like… more actual safety nets 
before people actually end up 
in prison. Those would be the 
most 
effective 
investments 

that we could make.”

Based 
on 
her 
own 

experiences 
incarcerated, 

panelist 
Asia 
Johnson 

highlighted the large positive 
impact students within the 
audience 
could 
make 
by 

volunteering at the prison.

“The students at U-M have 

been so instrumental in me 
becoming the woman that I am 
today,” Johnson said. “Even 
though I went to prison, I spent 
nine years of my life away, I 
feel like this is the best me that 
I’ve been in my whole life, and 
it’s only because people gave 
me their time.”

LSA 
senior 
Michele 

Laarman 
emphasized 
the 

importance 
of 
University 

students being aware of both 
reproductive 
injustice 
and 

mass incarceration.

 “Incarceration is a huge part 

of this nation,” Laarman said. 
“Not to know about stuff that’s 
going on all over the country and 
on such a massive scale, that’s 
not okay after you come out of 
a 
four-year 
degree 
program 

–– especially if you’re in social 

response to the comments.

According 
to 
Rackham 

student 
Kamaria 
Porter, 

whose research focuses on 
reporting 
sexual 
assault, 

this new proposal drastically 
limits the places that can 
be investigated to strictly 
on-campus sites.

In 2015, the University of 

Michigan 
Climate 
Survey 

found that 41.2 percent of non-
consensual sex occurred off 
campus for undergraduates 
and 72 percent for graduate 
students. Porter said limiting 
the 
scope 
would 
exclude 

the majority of cases and 
continue to perpetuate sexual 
misconduct and violence. She 
also claimed such restrictions 
open up opportunities for the 
University to avoid liability 
and put multiple harmful 
cases on the backburner.

Another 
big 
change 

in 
the 
new 
regulations 

was 
the 
definition 
of 

sexual 
harassment. 
In 

previous years, the Obama 
administration 
worked 
to 

broaden the definition, as 
well as increase guidelines 
to 
include 
the 
rights 
of 

transgender 
students. 

However, the new reforms 
roll back the safeguards for 
transgender student rights 
and narrow the definition. 

Now, only incidents that are 
deemed “severe” enough can 
be investigated. 

According 
to 
Sandra 

Levitsky, 
an 
associate 

professor in the Department 
of Sociology, the line for 
severity 
follows 
a 
very 

strict legal standard which 
eliminates many cases.

“Almost no cases will fall 

under the new definition — 
it’s really rigid,” Levitsky 
said.

According 
to 
Porter, 

the new proposal seeks to 
legalize the hearing process. 
All cases will now include a 
live hearing where both sides 
are mandated to go through 
cross-examinations. A similar 

decision was made by the Sixth 
Circuit Court last September 
which 
mandates 
the 

University 
adopt 
similar 

practices 
to 
the 
new 

regulation.

“It’s making it look like 

even more of a criminal 
trial-like 
procedure 
than 

an 
educational 
procedure 

you would find in a student 
conduct 
hearing,” 
Porter 

said. “The people running 
it 
— 
higher 
educational 

professionals — aren’t trained 
to be lawyers, be judges and 
operate in a criminal legal 
space. 
They’re 
educators, 

they want to help students 
go beyond their worst act. 
And they want to support 
students to heal in order to 
access education. The process 
doesn’t match the people that 
will be doing it.”

Porter 
said 
the 
move 

towards 
mandating 
cross-

examinations also introduces 
new problems of inequality 
and 
accessibility, 
claiming 

discrepancies between legal 
representatives and advisers 
in a misconduct case may 
make the decision process 
unfair.

“The 
new 
regulation 

doesn’t account for the power 
and 
resource 
differences 

between the parties,” Porter 
said. “This affects both sides.” 

In 
the 
wider 
political 

sphere, the opportunity to 
comment on a policy is not 
unique to the Department 

of Education. But due to the 
legal obligation the agency 
has to read every comment 
that is sent, Porter said it 
is essential for students to 
participate in the notice and 
comment process.

LSA 
sophomore 
Quinn 

Riley said the new regulations 
were mentioned in class but 
she wanted to actively work to 
reverse the new policies.

“My 
women’s 
studies 

course touched briefly on 
the new regulations,” Quinn 
said. “And I felt like it was 
my responsibility to be more 
informed 
as 
opposed 
to 

skimming the surface of a 
subject. They highlighted the 
fact that certain groups are 
marginalized by the proposed 
regulations and that’s what 
I’m going to be focusing my 
comment about.”

In 
the 
last 
hour, 
the 

event transitioned into an 
open space where audience 
members were encouraged to 
talk among each other and ask 
questions as they formulated 
their 
comments. 
Levitsky 

said the event hoped to create 
a strong voice against the 
regulation proposal that the 
Department 
of 
Education 

can’t ignore.

“This 
opportunity 
is 
a 

collective 
action 
to 
make 

sure that voices are heard by 
the Department of Education 
and our federal government,” 
Levitsky said.

and they’re disgusted.”

Public 
outcry 
forced 

Potts 
to 
close 
Pangea 

Piercing 
after 
a 
tweet 

accused him of espousing 
white supremacist ideology 
while giving a customer a 
piercing. 
Twitter 
user 
@

LauraStroudd tweeted that 
Potts “began to talk to me 
about 
white 
supremacy, 

and why ‘whites must stick 
together.’ He repeated many 
times that when it came down 
to ‘us vs them’ I would have to 
embrace my ‘white heritage’ 
to survive.” The tweet went 
viral and has been retweeted 
more than 6,000 times.

In a statement posted to his 

YouTube channel in August, 
Potts said his career was 
“over” and he was “completely 
done 
with 
the 
piercing 

business.” He noted he was 
“nowhere 
near 
politically 

correct,” but denied being an 
advocate of white supremacy.

“I can see why I present a 

perfect target in the current 
climate,” Potts said. “Calling 
out 
anti-Blackness, 
anti-

Semitism, 
homophobia 
or 

whatever is celebrated and 
accepted, but extending that 
to anti-whiteness, and quite a 
few people get that Pavlovian 
‘Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, 
what are you doing?’ — like 
that type of discrimination 
is somehow OK. I’ve always 
steadfastly said that no one 
should ever be disenfranchised 
or dispossessed because of 
characteristics 
they 
have 

no control over. I’ve always 
maintained that I do not want 
dominion over, nor seek to 
exploit, anyone — that’s like 
the exact opposite of white 
supremacy.”

Potts decided to reopen 

Pangea 
Piercing 
in 
late 

November, telling MLive that 
he was “a little nervous, but 
excited to hurry up and get 
back to work.”

Potts said he intended to 

install bars on the store’s 
windows and that he had 

taken steps to guarantee his 
employees’ safety as well as 
his own, installing security 
cameras throughout the shop 
and in the piercing bays.

Stenvig said Potts called the 

police because of the picketers 

on Saturday.

“He 
called 
the 
police, 

and they didn’t stop us from 
doing anything because we 
had the right to picket on the 
sidewalk, but he felt the need 
to have the police, like, escort 

him and the people who work 
there out at the end of the day, 
which is very unsustainable,” 
Stenvig said.

The 
other 
protesters 

outside of City Hall Monday 
night were members of The 
Ann Arbor Non-Lethal Deer 
Management, who held signs 
urging passing cars to “Stop 
the Shoot,” a reference to the 
city’s deer culling efforts. In 
2015, 
following 
complaints 

about what residents saw as an 
outsize deer population that 
resulted in car accidents and 
damage to landscaping, City 
Council voted to establish a 
deer cull to manage the local 
deer population.

Former Ann Arbor resident 

Maggie Sadoff said she moved 
out of the city in part because 
she was so opposed to the deer 
cull.

“I used to live in Ann 

Arbor,” Sadoff said. “I used 
to live in Ward 2, but I moved 
out because I was so disgusted 
by the deer cull. Now I live in 
Scio Township. With guns in 
the park, blood in the snow, 

I could not stomach it any 
longer. I wanted no part of it.”

The city’s third annual deer 

cull took place in January and 
lasted more than three weeks. 
Hunters were hired to kill up 
to 250 deer, but ultimately fell 
short, killing only 115.

Ann Arbor resident Sue 

Nelson said she thought killing 
deer was wrong, and called 
the deer cull ineffective. She 
disagreed with claims the 
deer cull was a humane way to 
kill deer that saved them from 
a slow death due to starvation 
or disease.

“Maybe I would argue there 

are too many humans,” Nelson 
said. “We need to live with 
wildlife and realize that we 
have come in and taken over 
their territory and accept the 
fact that they live here too.”

2019 will be the final year 

of the approved four-year deer 
management plan. The city has 
not yet released specifics for 
“lethal removal” plans for this 
upcoming winter.

MATT VAILLIENCOURT/Daily

Jeffrey Veidlinger, director of the Center for Judaic Studies, discusses the historical background of antisemitism during a panel hosted by the 
International Institute at Weiser Hall Monday afternoon.

“I used to live 
in Ward 2, but I 

moved out because 
I was so disgusted 
by the deer cull”

light of the court ruling may 
impose even more challenge 
around reporting … We need 
to do everything we can in the 
context of this legal limitation 
to 
support 
students 
that 

come forward with claims of 
misconduct to hopefully make 
sure they still feel comfortable. 
Particularly on these stories of 
sexual misconduct, when you 
think or get information from 
people that don’t think the 
University is paying adequate 
attention or if someone accuses 
the University of trying to 
brush under the rug or hide 
these episodes, I can tell you 
that couldn’t be more wrong 
… The darn problem with 
these cases, even this one in 
Music, Theatre and Dance that 
has become a bit notorious, 
the initial complaints were 
anonymous complaints, and it’s 
extremely difficult to follow-
up on anonymous complaints 
but we do … When you don’t 
hear of an investigation it 
doesn’t mean the University is 
ignoring it. It’s just unfair and 
untrue and this notion that it’s 
in the University’s best interest 
somehow to hide misconduct is 
exactly the opposite.

TMD: 
Given 
the 
recent 

midterm 
regents 
elections, 

the new partisan makeup of 
the board is seven Democrats 
and one Republican. Although 
the members of the Board are 
supposed to be nonpartisan, 
how do you believe this shift 

towards 
a 
large 
majority 

Democrats will influence the 
decisions made on behalf of the 
University and the issues the 
Board decides to undertake?

MS: Rarely do partisan issues 

show up in discussions by the 
board. 
They’re 
responsible 

for supervising me and then 
general 
oversight 
of 
the 

University, and there are way 
more similarities than there 
are differences between the 
members of different parties 
… With two new people, that’s 
a quarter of the group that’s 
different so there’s a whole new 
dynamic and people come in 
with their own background and 
the issues they care about … but 
I wouldn’t parse those things 
into Democrat or Republican.

TMD: Why do you think we 

are one of the only three public 
universities in Michigan that 
hold statewide elections for the 
regents?

MS: It’s historic. It was 

done here in a moment in time 
as part of the bylaws of the 
University of Michigan. The 
other universities in the state 
that do this are Wayne State 
and Michigan State University. 
The other publics all have 
appointed boards.

TMD: Do you foresee that 

changing in the future?

MS: I don’t see the politics 

that would lead to a change.

TMD: In terms of political 

platforms, 
candidates 

like Jordan Acker and Paul 
Brown 
were 
running 
on 

affordability, which, as you 
said, is very nonpartisan, but 
what about issues like Richard 
Spencer last year and free 

speech, which are very partisan 
issues?

MS: I don’t think Democrats 

or Republicans were thrilled 
with the content of what Richard 
Spencer would speak about. I 
don’t think either party would 
be excited about the specter of 
potential violence and spouting 
racist, misogynistic discourse 
… I think that members of 
both parties recognize that 
free speech is essential for 
a 
university 
… 
We’ve 
had 

discussions 
on 
the 
board 

about whether the campus is 
sufficiently welcoming to more 
conservative political points 
of view or whether they get 
suppressed … The commitment 
to free speech is bipartisan. 
People look at different groups 
and worry differently but the 
commitment is that same.

TMD: At our last meeting, 

you discussed the formation 
of a committee to address 
the 
University’s 
goals 
for 

carbon 
neutrality. 
Students 

have expressed a hope that 
the “proper individuals” will 
be placed on the committee to 
ensure success. How are you 
taking into account the voices 
of 
student 
environmental 

advocates or supporting faculty 
when 
selecting 
committee 

members?

MS: The goal of making us 

carbon neutral is very hard … 
Experts say the same thing, 
they’re not sure how we’re 
going to get there. There are 
lots of ideas and it’s going to 
take a window of time … It’s 
going to be complicated. It’s an 
area that’s so important that 
there’s so much activism not 

just by students, but by faculty 
and staff, citizens of Ann 
Arbor and the state. Everybody 
would want to be a part of this 
commission because everybody 
wants to help. What I have 
found is that for a group to be 
effective it can’t be too large. 
I’m going to try to keep it to 
a reasonable size that allows 
it to be high functioning and 
schedule 
frequent 
meetings 

… To make up for the fact that 
we can’t possibly have every 
constituency represented on the 
committee or all the expertise 
we need, we’ll encourage the 
committee and help it set up 
other advisory groups who will 
be turned to for thoughts and 
advice.

TMD: How is the University 

also looking into other facets of 
anthropogenic climate change 
(wildfires, 
food 
shortages, 

coral reef depletion, etc.)?

MS: 
There 
are 
faculty 

interested in a large number 
of aspects of global climate 
change and sustainability. For 
instance, one of the initiatives 
funded through the Biosciences 
Initiative 
is 
global 
change 

biology … fascinating research 
but not directly related to our 
carbon neutrality process. This 
commission will be focused on 
advising the campuses on how 
to become carbon neutral in as 
rapid a time frame as we can 
handle economically and in a 
way that others can replicate so 
we make more of a contribution 
than just the campus.

TMD: 
On 
the 
topic 
of 

committees, a separate panel 
created to examine “obligations 
to students as instructors with 

regard to letter-writing and 
all other modes of academic 
support” was announced in 
October, reportedly containing 
mostly 
senior 
members 
of 

the 
University 
community 

and 
no 
representation 

from the humanities fields. 
Some faculty members have 
expressed concern regarding 
this 
lack 
of 
diversity 
in 

the 
panel. 
How 
does 
the 

administration 
intend 
to 

address these concerns?

MS: The idea is to appoint a 

committee that’s thoughtful, 
high-integrity, 
(with) 
high 

expertise on it, but empower 
them to reach out broadly 
across 
the 
campus 
where 

lots of people are concerned 
about 
the 
question 
that’s 

been called … The panel’s in 
charge of collecting thoughts 
from 
a 
diverse 
array 
of 

people as possible and then 
gathering 
those 
thoughts 

and presenting to the provost 
some recommendations and 
an analysis. The panel won’t 
make 
decisions. 
They’ll 

capture 
opinions, 
analyze 

them 
and 
present 
some 

recommendations, but then it’s 
really up to the provost and the 
deans and, to an extent, myself 
to decide how to move forward 
with these recommendations.

TMD: Some faculty members 

we’ve talked to said they think 
it would be helpful if lecturers 
and 
younger 
faculty 
are 

included on the panel because 
they’re often asked for letters 
of recommendation.

MS: Although (the esteemed 

professors) are very senior now, 
they weren’t senior for their 

whole lives and they’ve taught 
over decades in many different 
capacities so they do bring a lot 
of different types of expertise. 
But the criticisms are fair. 

TMD: Earlier this month, 

Mohamed Soumah, a University 
custodian, took refuge in an 
Ann Arbor church to avoid 
being deported by Immigration 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement. 

Due 
to 
a 
genetic 
kidney 

disease and a lack of adequate 
treatment in his home country 
of Guinea, Soumah has said: “If 
I get deported, I will die.” Is 
Soumah still an employee at the 
University?

MS: 
We 
don’t 
discuss 

information about employees 
with the media, with anybody 
in general and particularly 
if there are issues around 
status, oh my goodness, we just 
wouldn’t do that.

TMD: 
How 
does 
the 

University 
work 
to 
assist 

employees like Soumah who are 
at the risk of being deported?

MS: 
It’s 
similar 
to 
the 

situation with undocumented 
students. We obey the law, 
we don’t do law enforcement 
work on behalf of outside 
agencies, but when making 
legal requests for information 
that we’re obligated to provide, 
we provide it, but it has to be 
something that we’re legally 
obligated 
to 
provide. 
We 

want to be supportive of our 
employees, and we have to be in 
compliance with the law.

outlined in CSG’s resolution.

Senate 
Assembly 
Chair 

Neil Marsh wrote a response 
to CSG’s request on behalf of 
SACUA, noting the need for the 
University as a whole to address 
issues of climate change and 
to work toward amending the 
problems at hand as soon as 
possible. 

“SACUA 
joins 
with 
the 

broader University community 
in recognizing the existential 
threat posed by climate change 
and global warming,” Marsh 
wrote. 
“SACUA, 
therefore, 

supports 
the 
goals 
of 
the 

resolution recently passed by 
Central Student Government.”

The 
meeting 
continued 

as 
the 
assembly 
welcomed 

Schlissel and asked him about 
the most pressing issues facing 
University administration is 
facing as the Board of Regents 
will be meeting this Thursday. 
According to Schlissel, the 
most important issue that will 
be discussed at the meeting 
is sexual misconduct and the 
efforts to improve the handling 
of such reports on campus.

“We’re discussing our work 

around 
sexual 
misconduct 

and finding ways to improve 
reporting and make it easier to 
increase support for people who 
report,” Schlissel said. “The 
provost has set up a committee 
to look at various types of 
faculty-student 
relationships, 

and we’ll discuss the emerging 
advice and direction to go on 
that.”

Schlissel 
also 
noted 
the 

recent changes in the Board 
of Regents which two new 
members, Jordan Acker and 
Paul 
Brown, 
who 
will 
be 

joining in January. Though 
they are qualified, Schlissel 
told the assembly, there is an 
onboarding process that they 
will participate in as their 
terms begin.

“I 
think 
I’ve 
spoken 
to 

both (Acker and Brown) and 
they both recognize their full 
enthusiasm and ideas, but they 
recognize they have to learn a 
lot more before they can really 
feel comfortable contributing 
as actively,” Schlissel said.

Schlissel 
closed 
by 

mentioning 
the 
upcoming 

retirement of Jerry May, vice 
president of Development, and 
noting his efforts over nearly 
eight years to raise $5 billion 
for the University through the 
Victors for Michigan campaign.

J

ames Madison wrote in 
the 
Federalist 
Papers, 
“Pure 
democracies 
have ever been spectacles of 
turbulence and contention; have 
ever been found incompatible 
with personal security, or the 
rights of property; and have, in 
general, been as short in their 
lives as they have been violent in 
their deaths.” He and the other 
Founding 
Fathers 
extensively 
studied historical governments, 
specifically of ancient Rome and 
Greece. They learned from these 
case studies to not only distrust 
concentration of power at the top, 
but to fear common people acting 
unwittingly against the public 
good in fits of passion or short-
sightedness. This is an important 
lesson 
that 
was 
relevant 
in 
their time, but remains equally 
applicable today.
This past week in a class 
of mine, my professor used 
California’s Proposition 13 from 
1978 as an example to illustrate 
the importance of good fiscal 
policy. This proposition passed 
with 65 percent of the popular 
vote and dramatically reshaped 
tax policy in California. The 
intended purposes were to ease 
the tax burden in California and 
to protect homeownership in the 
state. The legislation reduced 
property taxes to levels from 1975-
1976, capped the amount they 
could increase from year-to-year 
and established a requirement 
for a two-thirds majority vote in 
Congress to increase taxes.
In this lecture, we learned that 
the proposition immediately cut 
$6 billion from local government 
revenue and gave taxpayers 57 
percent tax relief. Unfortunately, 
school and highway spending 
is tied to the usually stable 
property tax revenue source, 

and soon California’s class sizes 
skyrocketed, 
while 
highway 
spending plummeted. In order 
to correct this hasty policy, 
California increased sales and 
income taxes so much that it is 
now the most heavily taxed state 
in the country, but the issue of 
property taxes remains the same.
What we can see from this one 
example is that the hasty and ill-
informed actions of the majority 
of 
Californians 
destabilized 
and mutated the state’s revenue 
sources, gutted local governments, 
put more control in the hands of 
the state over locals and required 
a patchwork solution to the 
problem they caused, all without 
accomplishing their original goal 
of lowering taxes in the long run.
This is obviously just one 
example, but speaks to the fears 
of the Founding Fathers. The 
U.S. Constitution is a complex 
document that sought to balance 
power 
between 
every 
party 
involved. This includes but is not 
limited to conflicts between the 
executive, legislative and judicial 
branches; the state and federal 
governments; and government 
and the people.
Alexander 
Hamilton 
once 
said “The body of people…do not 
possess the discernment and 
stability necessary for systematic 
government. To deny that they are 
frequently led into the grossest 
errors by misinformation and 
passion, would be a flattery 
which their own good sense must 
despise.” What I believe he is 
saying here is that the citizenry 
of this country is smart enough 
to know that we are not smart 
enough to govern. His concern 
was certainly well-placed, but 
today many pick and choose when 
to apply it. Many so passionately 
espoused 
this 
concern 
of 

inexperience 
when 
President 
Donald Trump announced his 
candidacy for presidency, yet these 
past midterm elections incited 
many different emotions. This past 
year has seen a dramatic increase 
in the popularity of citizen-drawn 
districts in states, with some states 
passing legislation or approving 
propositions to establish these 
citizen-commissions, 
taking 
away 
the 
power 
of 
elected 
representatives to draw districts 
in favor of normal citizens.
This 
Jekyll 
and 
Hyde 
personality of America regarding 
who should be trusted with power 
is something to be monitored and 
concerned about. What is scariest 
about this is that people do not 
even recognize inconsistencies 
in their own logic. They act with 
short-term 
interest 
in 
mind, 
clouded by their passions, at the 
cost of long-term goals. This 
past election, most of the failed 
measures would have increased 
taxes, far higher than the usual 50 
percent rate over the last 15 years. 
I am not arguing that Trump 
is 
unqualified, 
that 
citizen 
commissions are necessarily bad 
and certainly not that higher taxes 
are a good thing. What I do believe 
is that the common people will, 
when they are allowed, mortgage 
the future in favor of short-term 
interests. This debate over instant 
versus delayed gratification has 
been studied psychologically since 
Walter Mischel’s marshmallow 
test, in which kids were given the 
option between one marshmallow 
now or two later.

I

t’s the worst when it’s 
our friends. Because we 
couldn’t possibly have seen 
it coming, otherwise he 
wouldn’t be a friend. 
But then he tells us that 
the #MeToo movement 
is a witch hunt. He tells 
us that women have too 
much power. He tells us 
that he lives in fear.
So to those boys who 
think they have the right 
to tell us that they live in 
fear of being accused and 
having their lives ruined, 
you are wrong. You don’t even 
know what fear is.
Do you know why you’re 
afraid? Because this is the first 
time anyone has told you your 
actions are wrong. You have just 
seen all these mighty men, many 
of whom you probably looked up 
to, fall to their knees. And you 
recognize some of your behaviors 
in those men, behaviors that have 
never been fully recognized as 
harmful, at least not by men, and 
by extension, general society. 
And instead of thinking, “I never 
realized this before, but maybe 
my actions are harmful. I should 
change that,” you wonder, “Am 
I next?” And then you lash out. 
You bury these insecurities and 
blame it on the system, relying 
on a society that has put you on a 
pedestal since the beginning of 
time to back you up. You do not 
feel fear, you feel guilt. You just 
don’t realize it.
So to dissuade this buried 
guilt, you change the topic. “It’s 
just an issue of ‘innocent until 
proven guilty’ and cold hard 
evidence, gender has nothing 
to do with it!” You think that by 
framing this argument in terms 
of the justice system you can get 
away with saying sexist things 
because they don’t sound sexist. 
You cover up your sexism with 
claims of justice — justice for the 
man wrongfully accused, but not 
for the women who have been 
silenced. You give yourself the 
privilege of taking gender out of 
the equation, a privilege that only 
you are granted. But sexism is a 
constant companion of rape cases. 
You cannot separate the two, and 
trying to ignore this inherent 
truth is, in itself, sexist.
When that doesn’t work, you 
play the victim card, though you 
lack the deck from which it came. 
You cry that men are the real 
victims; that their lives can be 
ruined by these women; that any 
man can be wrongfully accused; 
that 
the 
#MeToo 
movement 

is a witch hunt. You equate a 
stained reputation, one that often 
doesn’t even get them barred 
from a job (take the 
Supreme Court for 
example), to lives 
being ruined. You 
think some of the 
sensational 
media 
stories applies to 
every man who has 
been accused in this 
#MeToo era being 
crucified and sent 
to rot in jail. And 
you 
conveniently 
forget how much sexual assault 
ruins the woman’s life. Not only 
is she assaulted, but when she 
has the courage to come forward, 
she is tormented, ridiculed and 
threatened. By people like you. 
You are so self-important that you, 
for some reason, think that women 
will drag themselves down just to 
take you with them. Ask yourself 
why someone would do that. And 
don’t tell us that it’s because there 
are bad people in the world. We 
already know that. They walk 
behind us at night, they come up to 
us in clubs, they sit at our breakfast 
tables. We look them in the eyes 
every day.

What you could do instead is 
understand that you will never 
understand. 
You 
will 
never 
understand what it is like to be a 
woman and to constantly live in 
fear. You were not taught to fear 
from the moment you were old 
enough to walk. You will never 
understand the courage it takes 
to stand up for yourself when 
you have been hurt, even when 
everyone around you is telling you 
to stop and calling you a liar. But 
that’s OK. We don’t expect you to 
understand. We just expect you to 
support those who do. You have 
seen this massive shift in a society 
that has previously protected 
you from consequences, and that 
change, like any other, is scary. 
We are, as a country, in a period 
of growth and change. And that 
change comes with doubt. But 
there are other ways to handle this 

change. Instead of telling us they 
live in fear, some boys tell us that 
now are more careful about what 
they do. They tell us they try to lend 
their support to women and put 
them in the spotlight where they 
can finally be heard. But others 
equate this sudden realization that 
their actions have consequences 
to living in fear, which is outright 
disrespectful. You cannot equate 
your fear of being accused to the 
fear of being raped. Because at 
the end of the day, you can change 
your actions to be less harmful and 
less likely to draw retribution. We 
cannot change our gender.
I live in fear of walking at 
night. I walked home from a club 
meeting that got out across town 
at 12:30 a.m., and I was terrified. 
I saw a group of men outside a 
store and I immediately crossed 
the street, my heart pounding, 
my palms sweating. My parents 
found out, and both of them 
yelled at me. And you told me 
that I can prevent walking home 
alone. Like it’s my fault and my 
job to change my behaviors. We 
must assume the worst could 
happen and fix ourselves, rather 
than the problem itself. You tell 
us we must assume the worst, 
but also criticize me for doing the 
same in a trial setting. You tell us 
to assume the worst of women, 
but give men the benefit of the 
doubt.
I live in fear of being alone 
with a boy. Even boys that I am 
friends with. Because I was 
taught that I could not trust 
any boys with myself. And you 
tried to invalidate my fear by 
telling me that you, too, live in 
fear of being alone with a girl, 
because she could accuse you of 
rape when you’ve done nothing 
wrong. Like that’s just as bad and 
just as common as being raped.
I live in fear, and I have never 
been harmed. I don’t even know 
what it’s like to actually go 
through this. But I have heard 
enough stories; I have talked to 
enough friends; I have been told 
enough times that I know the 
fear.
I live in fear that I will write 
this article again. I’ve written 
it before. My fingers are tired 
of typing. My head is tired of 
pounding. My heart is tired of 
aching. I am tired of living in 
fear.
You live in fear? You don’t 
even know what fear is.

he 
Ohio 
House 
of 
Representatives recently 
passed 
a 
piece 
of 
legislation about abortion that has 
been dubbed a “heartbeat bill” by 
a whopping 60 votes for and 35 
votes against. The bill would ban 
abortions after a fetal heartbeat 
can be detected with absolutely 
no exceptions. To describe this 
bill as “hardline” would be to 
woefully understate things.
Abortions needed due to rape 
and incest would not be allowed 
outside of this time frame. Does 
that seem right to you? While 
a fetal human heart may start 
beating as soon as four weeks, 
it usually cannot be detected 
by existing medical technology 
before 
six 
weeks. 
Assuming 
national trends more or less apply 
to Ohio, this would effectively 
criminalize 65.4 percent of all 
abortions.
If passed by the Ohio Senate, 
the bill would also shift the legal 
status of fetuses from “unborn 
human” to a person with full 
legal protections under Ohio law. 
In other words, the contents of a 
pregnant woman’s reproductive 
system would be deemed a life 
equal to yours or mine. The 
ramifications of such a change are 
nothing short of depraved.
This provision means that 
women who seek out and receive 
successful abortions after the 
allowed period would be subject 
to first-degree murder charges. 
Really. I’m not making this 
up. What makes this provision 
especially sinister is that Ohio is 
a state in which the barbaric and 
unconstitutional death penalty is 
still legal. In practice, a woman 
who receives an abortion at six 
weeks because she’s carrying her 
rapist’s child could be subject to 
murder under state law.
And while crazy laws with no 
chance of passing get proposed in 
state legislatures all the time, this 
“heartbeat bill” certainly does not 
fall into this category. For starters, 
the Ohio Senate — where the bill 
is now headed — is completely 
dominated 
by 
anti-abortion 
Republicans. Furthermore, Ohio 
governor-elect 
Mike 
DeWine, 
one of President Donald Trump’s 
lackeys, has promised to sign the 
bill should it be brought to his 
desk. It is far more likely than not 
that this bill becomes law.

As for abortion providers, 
doctors 
that 
administer 
an 
abortion 
post-fetal 
heartbeat 
would be guilty of a fifth-
degree felony, punishable by 
up to a year in prison and a 
$2,500 fine. There have been 
some questions surrounding the 
constitutionality of this bill. Does 
it conflict with Roe v. Wade’s 
set legal precedent? Answers 
may vary, but make no mistake: 
The Republican majority in the 
Supreme Court will not strike 
down or oppose this bill should it 
become codified law.
Those pushing for this bill 
to pass call themselves “pro-
lifers.” This is wrongheaded. If 
they were really pro-life, they 
would be pooling their time and 
resources into striking down the 
death penalty not just in Ohio, 
but on the federal level. How can 
you be “pro-life” and pro-death 
penalty?
Those who subscribe to this 
twisted way of thinking may 
claim that they are opposed to the 
taking of innocent life and that 
certain criminals do not deserve 
to live. This may seem reasonable 
on its surface, but, upon further 
investigation, 
this 
argument 
proves to be a fallacious one. 
For starters, studies reviewing 
exonerations and post-mortem 
pardons have found that at least 4 
percent of death row inmates are 
innocent.
So long as our justice system 
is operated by fallible people, 
error in convictions will exist. 
Should we do what we can to 
reduce judicial error? Of course. 
However, as long as our system 
of law and order is imperfect, 
drastic 
and 
irreversible, 
capital punishment is simply 
unjustifiable.
The 
second 
part 
of 
the 
aforementioned 
argument 
is 
based on an incorrect premise. 
Life 
is 
a 
constitutionally 
enshrined right, not a privilege. 
Therefore, one does not have 
to “deserve” life, as it is an 
inalienable right. To ignore this 
is to rip out the foundation of our 
entire code of laws. This would be 
unwise at best, and wretched and 
rogue at worst.
Self-avowed 
Republican 
“pro-life” advocates also tend to 
support endless war which, of 
course, leads to the brutalization 

and destruction of the lives of 
so many. They also fall in line 
with a party that has waged a 
seemingly never-ending crusade 
against 
America’s 
already 
embarrassingly bounded social 
safety net. In other words, they 
may want you to be born, but 
are not too concerned with what 
happens afterwards.
It is precisely this that so 
limits the appeal of the “pro-
life” movement. While half of 
Americans identify with the “pro-
life” stance in regards to abortion, 
so many of them simply cannot 
sign on to what this movement 
has become. The wildly hardline 
approach to the issue exhibited 
by this “heartbeat bill” is not 
only alienating, it’s evil. The 
frothing-at-the-mouth bloodlust 
for women who get abortions, 
as exhibited in this piece of 
legislation, is even causing people 
who find abortion to be largely 
immoral to see the “pro-life” 
movement as adversaries.
Pro-choice 
advocates 
often 
label those on the other side of 
the issue as anti-women. While 
this is certainly not the case for 
all, it is not wholly unjustified 
either. This bill proves that. 
The sweeping language of the 
bill makes it unclear whether 
or not women who miscarry 
would be legally allowed to get 
surgical procedures to prevent 
infections and other potential 
complications.
The fact of the matter is that 
the movement is not “pro-life,” 
it’s just anti-abortion. I feel 
comfortable calling myself pro-
life, because I am consistent. 
45,000 
Americans 
die 
every 
year for lack of ability to afford 
healthcare — I’m against that. 
Our country, shamefully, has 
been at war for 225 years out of its 
242-year existence — I’m against 
that.
What I am trying to say is that 
the pro-life worldview should be 
just that: a worldview. “Pro-life” 
should be a praise only afforded 
to those who exhibit that stance 
across the board. Being pro-life, 
truly pro-life, is the only way 
forward for a nation that aspires 
to justice and morality.

Not pro-life, just anti-abortion

FILM SERIES

I’m 
not 
quite 
sure 
how 
one could possibly put a sour 
spin on the illustrious and 
stunning masterpiece that is 
“A Star is Born.” Truly, though, 
it would be a flat-out lie to 
pretend that “Shallow” and its 
hauntingly-beautiful lyrics are 
not permanently playing on a 
loop in our heads ever since 
the big screen went dark. With 
breathtaking performances from 
Bradley Cooper (“War Dogs”) 
and 
Lady 
Gaga 
(“American 
Horror Story: Hotel”), a spine-
chillingly-killer 
soundtrack 
and a tone of authenticity that 
prevails throughout, “A Star is 
Born” is an electric knockout 
(and it better win a damn Oscar). 
The 
film’s 
portrayal 
of 
what appears to be such a 
real romance speaks volumes 
to 
the 
technology-saturated 
generations of today. Jack’s 
question of whether Ally is 
“happy in this modern world,” 
or 
“need(s) 
more” 
ripples 
through the minds of millennial 
and Gen Z viewers alike. We 
ponder Jack’s throaty lyrics, 
wondering 
if 
perhaps, 
in 
today’s social-media and tech-
overdosed world, we do need 
more than Tinder “dates” and 
raunchy, late night “u-ups.” The 
film perfectly resonates with an 
audience that feels nostalgic for 
a time they never knew, a time 
when romance was concrete, 
raw, built on genuine connection 
and, well, not dead.
Let’s rewind to Jack and Ally’s 
written-in-the-stars 
meet-
cute at the drag bar. Jack’s first 
encounter with Ally is one where 
she doesn’t know he is watching. 
She is in her zone. Performing 
at her local bar, Ally radiates a 
relaxed, yet sexy sophistication 
and 
intensity 
that 
Jack 
is 
enticed by almost immediately. 
Right from the start, Jack is 
introduced to the real Ally. 
This first meeting is unsullied 
by superficial impressions from 
profile pictures or bio captions, 
and instead, Jack and Ally are 
introduced to one another in 

their natural states, Jack slow-
talking and buzzed off more 
than a few drinks and Ally 
performing 
an 
enchanting 
rendition of “La Vie en Rose.” 
Cooper’s 
superb 
directing 
weaves this same vibe of realness 
throughout the remainder of the 
film, hooking us into a love so 
outstanding and wondrous, we 
swear it is from another time. 
Following the evolution of Jack 
and Ally’s relationship from 
their initial run-in at the bar 
to their ridiculously charming 
gas station non-date to their 
cross-country 
road-tripping 
adventures and finally, to their 
married life, our fascination 
with 
their 
otherworldly 
chemistry and music continues 
to grow, ultimately reaching its 
peak with Jack’s gut-wrenching 
death. As our tears, or rather, 
our sobs, echo through the 
theater walls, we can’t help 
but glorify Cooper’s directing 
chops and say a prayer of thanks 
for the gift that is Lady Gaga’s 
vocal chords. By the end of 
this film, a realization that we 
could never have known hours 
before sets in: We may never 
be ready for another movie-
romance because this one was 
just that good. Like Ally, we 
find ourselves believing that 
we too may “never love again.” 
And once “A Star is Born” enters 
on-demand streaming, we may 
never have to.

Hesitant after the impression 
the trailer of Bradley Cooper’s 
“A Star is Born” had left, I asked 
a male friend: Does the film 
imply a woman needs a man 
to succeed? He paused briefly, 
before answering, “no.”
Hesitant after realizing I had 
asked a male friend a question 
about gender relations, I asked a 
female friend the same question. 
She paused slightly longer, but 
also answered, “no.”

Little did I know that the 
question I should have been 
asking all along went something 
more like, “Does the film imply 
that for a female star to be born, 
a male star has to die?” Given 
that each of the four iterations of 
“A Star is Born” stay loyal to this 
detail, apparently the answer is, 
“yes.”
I 
cannot 
withhold 
Lady 
Gaga’s 
due 
praise 
for 
her 
portrayal 
of 
Ally. 
With 
a 
commanding 
performance, 
she manages to seize control 
of every scene — perhaps even 
ones she wasn’t supposed to 
dominate. That paired with 
her and Cooper’s chemistry 
makes for an unconventionally 
balanced love story in terms of 
how it treats each respective 
lover as independent though 
their stories may intertwine.
But “A Star is Born” has to 
be held to more than its acting 
performances. It’s yet another 
instance of Hollywood’s raging 
reboot fever, so it is also about 
the stories we consider worth 
retelling, as well as how we go 
about retelling them.
Every “Star” has been about 
stars, of course. The near-
century 
of 
remakes 
would 
suggest the story continues 
to 
allow 
insight 
into 
the 
entertainment 
industry. 
However, the latest iteration 
hardly ever averts its eyes from 
the leads, so the film lacks the 
contextualization 
that 
could 
help not only justify the remake 
but also help it say something 
new.
Instead, the main strategy 
Cooper’s version employs to 
modernize the story are minute 
reversals 
of 
gender-based 
injustices. For example, Cooper’s 
character 
Jack 
expresses 
a 
fetishistic 
appreciation 
for 
Gaga’s character Ally’s nose 
after she reveals it barred her 
from success in the industry. 
In another scene, Ally throws a 
punch at an overbearing fan in 
defense of Jack.
But the film remains loyal to 

Irreconcilable differences: ‘A Star is Born’ divides

other formulae, many of which 
yield disconcerting biproducts. 
From 1937 to the present day, 
every time the female star 
is born, the male star dies. 
Regardless of whether that male 
star is self-destructive, a female 
cannot seem to rise without 
causing her man to fall.
Which brings me to my last 
point (Can I say it? I have to 
say it): I’m tired of love stories 
— formulaic ones. Love stories 
that seek to gratify audiences 
with hasty marriages rather 
than questioning our reliance 
on a flawed institution, that 
prescribe 
romance 
as 
the 
ultimate 
form 
of 
intimacy 
between a man and a woman, 
that ask us to go gaga over 
another white, heterosexual, 
cisgender couple.
No matter how many minute 
reversals 
accumulate, 
these 
larger tropes make 2018’s “A 
Star is Born” the same old song 
and story. It might not be worth 
retelling.

This fourth edition of the 
well-trodden, 
self-destructive 

musician story leads off with 
a powerful 45 minutes. Held 
up by a great one-two punch 
performance 
form 
Bradley 
Cooper as the vodka-guzzling, 
fallen-star 
Jackson 
Maine, 
and Lady Gaga as the industry 
newcomer Ally, the film’s first 
act is an affecting road movie 
about two characters who act 
as each other’s moments of 
salvation. The relationship is 
inviting, though fraught, and 
has just enough sour to it to 
breathe the mustard-gas breath 
of what’s to come. “A Star is 
Born” first finds its strength in 
the two characters it presents, 
and only begins to lose its way 
when it forgets that. 
As soon as Gaga’s Ally signs 
a record deal, as soon as she 
begins her own musical journey, 
the plot then somewhat split 
between the characters, the 
film’s texture begins to slip 
away. Quickly, “A Star is Born” 
becomes a movie about self-
destructive tropes instead of a 
movie about the two characters 
who had grabbed our attention 
so far. The last hour or so 
focuses, then, on how the two 
drift apart, how the rifts of 
career and pride tear rifts in 
their household. It would be 

wrong to say that the film isn’t 
allowed to be sad, instead my 
criticism would be that the film 
doesn’t seem interested in being 
anything else. Sometimes the 
visceral reaction you get from 
a movie like “A Star is Born” is 
conflated with abject quality 
in the work of art. The film is 
difficult and sad through and 
through, but I’d closer classify it 
as a work in grief-porn than as a 
terrific piece of cinema.
The 
dissociation 
of 
the 
characters in “A Star is Born” 
is interesting, as it shows how 
a movie can lose itself when it 
puts its themes in front of the 
characters that are supposed 
to carry them. The second 
and third acts of “A Star is 
Born” could have been out of 
any movie about a troubled, 
alcohol-abusing musician in a 
relationship — and that’s not a 
good thing. It’s understandable 
that the film wanted to see 
itself as two halves — building 
the relationship up, and then 
tearing it back down — but in 
order for it to do that properly, 
in order to turn those two halves 
into a whole, it has to feel like it’s 
the same movie the entire time. 
— Stephen Satarino, 
Daily Arts Writer

Irreconcilable Differences is a format where we talk about movies that we just can’t decide on. Is it good? Is it bad? What are its merits as a 
work of cinema? Irreconcilable Differences is meant to be read with some knowledge of the film in question and a strong set of opinions. 

BOOK REVIEW

“I Might Regret This” is 
the kind of book that doesn’t 
come along very often. Freshly 
heartbroken from her first love, 
Abbi Jacobson — of “Broad 
City” fame — sets out to drive 
from New York to Los Angeles, 
hoping the change of pace and 
scenery would both distract 
her and give her insight. The 

book she wrote about this 
experience isn’t literary in any 
traditional sense; it’s not really 
about language or plot. Instead, 
it’s messy and rambling. It feels 
unedited in the best way.
“I Might Regret This” takes 
a few chapters to settle into. 
Jacobson throws convention 
out 
the 
window, 
and 
it’s 
sometimes hard to keep up 
with the breakneck pace of 
her mind. At one point, for 
example, 
Jacobson 
recalls 
filming “6 Balloons” and being 
unable to hit breakaway glass 
with a set of keys, and while 
she has explaining this she’s 
in a field in Southern Utah in 
the middle of the night, and 
somehow the whole time she’s 
been joking about a wooden 
buffalo 
keychain 
and 
Hot 

Pockets and her reckless alter 
ego, Babbi.
A few pages earlier, Jacobson 
lists “A few thoughts on the 
1997 film ‘My Best Friend’s 
Wedding,’” the first of which is: 
“How was Julia Roberts such 
a respected and feared food 
critic by the age of twenty-
seven? Is this possible?” She 
contemplates 
later, 
“Maybe 
hotels 
put 
out 
so 
many 
different-size towels so you 
have lots of options to cover up 
light sources in the middle of 
the night.”
This writing style is both 
thrilling 
and 
frustrating. 
Much 
like 
when 
viewing 
“Broad City,” part of the joy 
of reading “I Might Regret 
This” is the scramble to follow 
along with the barrage of jokes 
and moments of clarity. By 
the second half of the book, 
though, Jacobson settles into a 
more contemplative voice, and 
it’s the sections at the end of 
the book that elevate “I Might 
Regret This” from a playful, 
frenzied romp across America 
to a truly exceptional memoir.
The turning point comes 
during 
a 
strip 
mall 
aura 
reading in Sedona (of course), 
when Jacobson breaks down 
crying. “This part of myself I’d 
been trying to hide, the thing 
I avoided communicating to 
anyone: that I might be right 
back where I started, unlovable 
and unable to love,” she writes. 
“But I gave them five stars on 
Yelp, because … damn.”
On the drive from Sedona 
to Jerome, Ariz., Jacobson 
catalogues the best bagels of 
her life. Like almost everything 

in “I Might Regret This,” the 
list is really about love, in all 
its iterations and peculiarities, 
and 
about 
the 
interplay 
between love and identity — 
how over and over love makes 
and remakes us, through its 
absence as well as its presence.
Jacobson 
writes 
fondly 
about The Bagel Factory, where 
she hung out in high school and 
which provided “the perfect 
food for the past version of 
myself that wore headscarves 
and operated at peak weed 
consumption.” 
College-
era Hidden Bean Bagels are 
a 
conduit 
for 
Jacobson’s 
memories of riding the bus 
alone from Baltimore to New 
York City every weekend: “I’d 
stare out the window listening 
to 
music, 
chomping 
on 
a 
cinnamon raisin bagel with 
butter I’d grabbed from the 
cafe for the ride. Soon I would 
step off the bus on my own, in 
the most interesting place in 
the whole world.”
Jacobson is tuned into the 
ways that physical objects, 
details, smells and tastes shape 
the bigger things in our lives. 
Our loves, our insecurities, our 
heartbreaks, our griefs: She 
understands that these things 
are 
intricately 
constructed, 
that their incongruities and 
moments of humor lend them 
texture and weight. The ability 
to understand that sadness 
and joy and ridiculousness 
are necessarily intertwined: 
This is what has always made 
Jacobson’s comedy so tenderly 
funny. Like “Broad City,” “I 
Might Regret This” is in a 
league of its own.

‘I Might Regret This’ an 
exciting, original memoir
Over Thanksgiving break I 
watched “Sorry to Bother You,” 
Boots Riley’s absurdist, amazing 
directorial 
debut. 
After 
the 
movie was over, I scoured the 
internet for takes — my jaw still 
dropped — and landed on A.O. 
Scott’s New York Times write-
up. In the review the film critic 
claims “If Mike Judge’s ‘Office 
Space’ 
and 
Robert 
Downey 
Sr.’s ‘Putney Swope’ hooked 
up after a night of bingeing on 
hallucinogens, Marxist theory 
and the novels of Paul Beatty and 
Colson Whitehead, the offspring 
might look something like this.”
That’s a loaded critique, but 
upon reading it I had a gratifying 
realization: I’ve read Paul Beatty 
and Colson Whitehead. That’s 
right; I, Mr. Scott, understand 
your reference, for I am an 
English major, which instills in 
me the ability to find thematic 
threads between Beatty’s “The 
Sellout” and Whitehead’s “The 
Underground 
Railroad” 
and, 
most crucially, formulate an 
intertextual framework to then 
contextualize “Sorry to Bother 
You.”
As we enter the holiday season, 
I should recognize that grappling 
with everything I’ve read in the 
course of my studies as an English 
Language & Literature major 
at the University — analyzing, 
discussing, writing about it — is 
the gift that keeps on giving, a 
yearly routine of Big Intellectual 
Shit.
There comes a time in your 
academic career — for me it 
took two full years — when you 
need to narrow your educational 
concentration 
and 
make 
a 
decision on your major. This is 
a choice that definitely won’t 
pigeonhole you into an industry 
for at least the first three to 
five years of your professional 

life, structurally limiting your 
personal growth for a formative 
portion of your young adult 
experience.
In any case, opting to study 
English signals a distinct turn at 
an otherwise universal fork in 
the road, and its consequences 
are one millionfold. For one, you 
never need to lug a calculator 
around, a major relief because 
the emotional baggage of lugging 

around one of those beautiful, 
burdensome 
TI-Nspires 
can 
surpass the real breakdown you 
experience when you see actual 
numbers on a Scantron exam. 
Instead your precious cargo 
comes in the form of Norton 
Anthologies, which make you 
look sophisticated enough and 
also justify a formidable amount 
of physical working space at 
library tables. Perhaps most 
importantly, majoring in English 
gives you more credence to make 
sweeping, sappy claims that 
studying English makes you a 
better person, which is exactly 
what I’m doing right now.
You see, I operate at a 
wavelength far more complex 
than that which is given meaning 
by 
programming 
languages 
like Python, C++, Java, because 
software 
engineers 
can’t 
possibly comprehend what it’s 

like 
to 
establish 
characters 
that 
flip 
binaries, 
or 
use 
language that subverts image, 
or splice narratives with split 
temporalities existing on the 
same timeline. I think.
Elevated thought, I’m aware. 
Thanks to such a critically-
thinking 
background, 
I 
can 
defuse 
the 
grandparents 
at 
Thanksgiving who ask about 
postgrad plans for the fourth 
time in one conversation despite 
insistence that no, Grandma, 
I don’t think I’d have much 
common 
discussion 
material 
with your book club friend who 
specializes in private equity, 
because I don’t know what 
private equity means, but I can 
tell you about how Peter Barry’s 
notions of the post-structuralist 
inform my takeaway on your own 
standards of post-professional 
life.
I’ll have you know, Grandma, 
that over the years I’ve listened to 
a handful of professors say things 
that very much changed the way 
I think about learning itself. 
When you reinvent your own 
foundations, you work from the 
ground up to create a new outlook 
altogether, 
and 
the 
results 
are 
(initially 
uncomfortable) 
rewarding gravy. We don’t know 
much about anything at this stage 
of existence, so taking unfamiliar 
risks only makes sense.
Besides, 
I 
get 
to 
walk 
out of class feeling smarter, 
better equipped for a range of 
dialogues, and eager to, um, do 
my homework most of the time. 
Not to mention, of course, the 
social upside: When all else fails 
conversationally, 
you 
always 
have the patented English major, 
“yeah, it’s really cool, don’t know 
what I’m going to do with it once 
I graduate though (haha).” A real 
laughing matter.

Surely the Second Coming 
of ‘Yeezus’ is approaching

November has come and gone, 
and Yandhi left with it. Despite 
enthusiastic words from Kim 
Kardashian, it was no surprise 
that Kanye West’s supposed 
ninth studio album did not 
appear on streaming services this 
Black Friday — a fact his legions 
had earlier been forced to come 
to terms with after Mr. West took 
to Twitter to go back on his wife’s 
promise.
All signs point to Yandhi 
being a spiritual sequel of sorts 
to Kanye’s 2013 output, Yeezus, 
(the similar title and cover art 
are the biggest clues) but taking 
into account how much Kanye’s 
career trajectory has changed in 
the half decade since the release 
of Yeezus, this act of continuation 
all seems a farce.
If there’s one thing Kanye 
has done well, it’s constantly 
evolving and pushing boundaries 
as an artist while still keeping 
everything 
precisely 
Kanye. 
Prior to this year’s ye, each of 
his albums ushered in a distinct 
era for the man: in his music, 
his fashion, his character. The 
best part of this was that Kanye 
always seemed to know when to 
pivot, when rockstar Kanye or 
soulful Kanye had overstayed 
their welcome, and to break 
down, rebuild and rebrand.
I would argue that no Kanye 
album ever needs a sequel. (Yes, 
I know The College Dropout, 
Late Registration and Graduation 
form a trilogy of sorts, but 
while thematically and slightly 
musically similar, they all have 
their own defining sound and 
Kanye himself was a much 
different person in 2004 than 
he was in 2007). And therein 
lies the core frustration with 
Yandhi. Any attempt to recreate 
the minimalist panache of Yeezus 
will result in failure. Yeezus is 
the culmination of every Kanye 
West we’ve ever known and 
every album he has ever offered, 
combined and distilled to the 
barest form. It is Kanye at his 
most complete.
Setting 
the 
contemporary 
politics of Kanye aside for the 
slightest moment, what little he 
has revealed about Yandhi spells 
unfulfillment. 
Starting 
with 
the two aforementioned chains 
which bind it to Yeezus, the name 
and the cover, one can infer the 
only reason for the similarity was 
to drive hype, in the same way that 
the first release date we got (“9 29 
18”) turned out to be a ploy to get 
the Kanye faithful to tune into 
a “Saturday Night Live” season 
premiere the same day, trading 
high attention and ratings for a 
surreal performance of “I Love 
It” with Lil Pump. But, in order 
to dive into Yandhi, one first has 
to understand Yeezus and what it 
represents, and what happened to 
Kanye in the meantime.
Yeezus’s 
cover, 
or 
lack 
thereof, is the perfect primer 
to the musical equivalent of a 
dental drill which lies within. 
As noted in a phenomenal Daily 
article regarding the album’s 
relationship with architecture 
and an interview Kanye did with 
The New York Times, Yeezus was 
in part recorded in an acoustically 
terrible Paris apartment, forcing 
the songs “to be super simple, 
because if you turned up some 
complicated sound and a track 
with too much bass, it’s not going 
to work in that space.” The cover 
is perhaps the simplest you can 
be, and speaking about the sparse 
promotion of the album Kanye 
echoes the same sentiment: “Shit, 
we ain’t even got no cover. We just 
made some real music.”
Regardless of the critical art 
theory lens through which the 
cover can be viewed, it’s clear 
that sound is Yeezus’s main, 
and perhaps only, focus. Which 
is almost ironic considering it 
came during the peak of Kanye’s 
arrogance: The days of VMA-
interrupting 
Kanye, 
whom 
Barack Obama even freely called 
a jackass, had somehow been 
eclipsed, replaced with a man 
who appeared to have seen it 
all, teetering between insanity 
and earnestness as he drilled 

hours 
of 
apocalyptic 
gospel 
and sublime self-affirmation to 
unready radio hosts. So, when 
you hear this variant of Kanye is 
releasing an album comparing 
himself to a savior revered by 
billions of people right from the 
title, you can’t help but roll your 
eyes, all while buckling up for the 
absolute.
And 
Yeezus 
immediately 
thrusts you into a car crash, as 
“On Sight” is every part abrasive 
and 
boundary-pushing 
while 
still retaining a certain charm, 
everything a Kanye song should 
be. The industrial soundscape of 
this introduction is interrupted 
halfway 
by 
something 
that 
defined 
early 
Kanye 
(what 
is 
“soul,” 
Alex?) 
when 
the 
synthesizers give way to a choir 
chanting “He’ll give us what 
we need / it may not be what 
we want.” This austere contrast 
of “On Sight” is a microcosm 
of everything Yeezus is: the 
intersection between harsh noise 
and soothing melodies, Kanye 
honing his craft of dredging up 
the most obscure yet pertinent 
samples and music as the starkest 
representation of the self.
There is no defining sound 
of Yeezus other than abstract 
sound itself. The sirens and 
distortion of “Send It Up” make it 
a more approachable “On Sight;” 
“Black Skinhead” would fit right 
in with Graduation and My 
Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy’s 
stadium rap anthems, save the 
zealous manifesto against the 
establishment and its racism; 
and “Guilt Trip” and its Kid 
Cudi croons feel an extension 
of the love and loss present on 
808s & Heartbreak. Each song 
starts with a single sound, be it 
the soft press of a piano key or 
a grisly drone, and then takes 
that sound and smashes it open, 
layering the space inside with 
Kanye’s vocals and stripped-
down drum patterns. And while 
Yeezus definitely pulls from the 
prior discography, it is as much a 
synthesis as it is a reconstruction.
The primary instrument of 
the album is the voice, whether 
that of Kanye, a collaborating 
artist or a sample. The artist’s 
full vocal range is on display, 
from his booming, grumbling 
bars on “I Am A God” to the 
auto-tuned trill found late in 
“Blood On The Leaves.” It is 
underpinned by a wealth of other 
singers and rappers — Chief 
Keef, Frank Ocean and Bon 
Iver, to name a few. The prolific 
samples themselves take on a 
life of their own, as Kanye and 
his legendary production team 
revive everything from Nina 
Simone’s rendition of “Strange 
Fruit” to a Hungarian rock power 
ballad. The kicker? The only 
official featured artist is God 
himself. Kanye is at the absolute 
forefront, asserting himself as 
the divinely untouchable and 
smashing open the musical ore to 
reveal 10 disparate crystals and 
their translucent mystery.
Yeezus is at the same time 
everything 
and 
nothing, 
an 
amalgamation and a destruction. 
I’ve talked about the progression 
of Kanye in a way that could 
make 
him 
seem 
like 
some 
“Split”-esque host for multiple 
personalities, whereas in reality 
all of these different Kanyes 
are just manifestations of some 
facet of his personality blown up 
to larger-than-life proportions. 
Work with me here, but consider 
Kanye West as a cow: Each cut 
of meat represents the Kanye 
associated 
with 
a 
specific 
album. They all vary in flavor 
and tenderness, but at their core 
they are all the same, all some 
sort of beef. Yeezus is the meat 
grinder into which everything 
was shoved in an attempt to make 
the perfect blend, employing 
each cut’s idiosyncratic taste and 
cutting out the fat.
But what do you do with the 
sonic sausage that pops out of 
the grinder? In The Life of Pablo’s 
case, you throw it in the trash. 
Yeezus 
broke 
Kanye’s 
music 
down and fashioned together 
something more complete with 
the resultant shards, but Pablo 
shattered everything completely. 
It’s hard to expand on perfect, so 
Kanye did what any perfectionist 

would do. He started anew on 
the quest to reach perfection, 
again. And with this blank slate, 
Kanye continued to find ways to 
innovate, literally going beyond 
the boundaries of an album. 
While it’s completely valid to 
dismiss The Life of Pablo as 
messy and unfinished (“Ima fix 
wolves”), the constant updates 
and abstract, jagged nature of 
it make sense when you view it 
as, in Kanye’s words, “a living 
breathing 
changing 
creative 
expression.”
While the initial reception to 
The Life of Pablo was mixed for a 
Kanye album, after people started 
to spend more time and live in 
conjunction with music, Kanye’s 
status as a genius auteur was not 
challenged. However, and it was 
hard to see then, chinks in the 
armor were beginning to expose 
themselves.
This 
vulnerability 
can 
be 
primarily found in some of the 
songs on Pablo. The production 
is excellent, as always, but for 
an album themed around the 
interplay between West’s public 
and private lives and reconciling 
with oneself, some of the lyrics 
are downright terrible. Yeezus 
has a few incendiary lines here 
and there (“Eatin’ Asian pussy, 
all I need was sweet and sour 
sauce” and “get this bitch shaking 
like Parkinson’s” surely stick 
with the listener) but they came 
off as an ironic self-awareness 
of West’s penchant to provoke. 
Yet on Pablo you get thought 
provoking verses like “I bet me 
and Ray J would be friends / if 
we ain’t love the same bitch” and, 
of course, the infamous “Now if 
I fuck this model / and she just 
bleached her asshole / and I get 
bleach on my T-shirt / I’mma 
feel like an asshole.” On Yeezus, 
Kanye asserted he’d “rather be 
a dick than a swallower,” but it 
resonated because his blunt and 
brash bravado was the point. 
He broke meaning down to the 
nitty-gritty but still conveyed 
exactly what he was thinking 
and feeling. He was a little lost 
with Pablo, and anyone looking 
for anything profound started 
to grasp at straws; Kanye being 
gross and ridiculous was nothing 
more than Kanye being gross and 
ridiculous.
When The Life of Pablo was 
released, the president who called 
Kanye West a jackass was still in 
office, and things — Kanye, our 
country — were OK. Nonetheless, 
it only took a few months for both 
of them to backslide. Kanye’s 
appearances on the Saint Pablo 
Tour became more a space for 
him to orate increasingly neurotic 
rants, culminating in a Nov. 17 
performance where he stated “If 
I would have voted, I would have 
voted for (Donald) Trump” and 
one two days later where he held 
the crowd verbally hostage and 
launched into a tirade against 
Hillary Clinton, Facebook and 
Jay-Z, among other things, after 
only performing three songs. The 
rest of the tour was cancelled 
shortly after, citing stress and 
exhaustion — ironically, the two 
feelings most of the country 
was wrought with after election 
night.
The ensuing spiral pulled 
Kanye down further and further. 
He was hospitalized for sleep 
deprivation 
and 
dehydration 
following the cancellation of 
the tour, and his first public 
resurfacing was in the lobby of 
Trump Tower, where West and 
the 
president-elect 
discussed 
“life.” It soon became clear 
that Kanye was suffering from 
severe mental health issues, but 
this led to the most fervent fans 
defending him and rephrasing 
his endorsement as something 
out of his control, a by-product 
of the toll stress, depression and 
paranoia exacted on him.
And as Kanye got worse, 
he made it harder and harder 
for himself to detach from the 
controversy. After a year of 
relative silence, he returned to 
Twitter in spring of this year, 
tweeting support of conservative 
personality 
Candace 
Owens. 
This snowballed into an erratic 
appearance 
on 
TMZ, 
where 
he made headlines for saying 
slavery “sounds like a choice.”

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
The summer gave us more 
doses of “dragon energy,” and 
at “SNL”’s season premiere in 
Sept. he quickly swapped his 
Perrier bottle cosplay for that red 
Make America Great Again hat 
to throw a rambling Pro-Trump 
speech at an uncomfortable cast 
and audience, inciting criticism 
from Kenan Thompson and even 
Lana Del Rey.
The situation was dire for 
Kanye stans, with tons jumping 
ship and even more expressing 
some form of betrayal. Some still 
held on that this did not spell the 
end for Kanye West and he would 
persevere, acknowledge his faults 
and grow from them. Then came 
what they thought was the nail in 
the coffin, his absolutely surreal 
conversation 
with 
President 
Trump in the Oval Office, which 
covered topics like the “iPlane 1” 
and the superhero armor Kanye 
felt the MAGA hat bestowed 
upon him. It seemed the only 
people left supporting him where 
the same ones who levelled racist 
comments against him for his 
nationally televised remark that 
“George Bush doesn’t care about 
Black people.”
Supporting 
Donald 
Trump 
doesn’t automatically make you 
a bad person. Falling prey to his 
treacherous rhetoric and being 
pulled 
into 
the 
inescapable 
hurricane of which Trump is the 
eye is when it starts to get ugly, 
and that’s precisely what Kanye 
did. Now, if this was a hip-hop 
artist of similar merit who had 
openly embraced conservative 
views for their whole career, this 
would be a different story, but 
this is Kanye West we are talking 
about.
Kanye West, the man who 
rapped “How we stop the Black 
Panthers? 
/ 
Ronald 
Reagan 
cooked up an answer / You hear 
that? What Gil Scott was hearin’ / 
When our heroes or heroines got 
hooked on heroin / crack raised 
the murder rate in D.C. and 
Maryland / we invested in that, 
it’s like we got Merrill Lynched 
/ and we been hangin’ from the 
same tree ever since.” The man 
who gave a giant middle finger to 
the one percent on Yeezus, telling 
people like Trump “Fuck you and 
your Hampton house.” Kanye’s 
fans looked up to him not only 
for his musical prowess but for 
him using his platform to call out 
those in power when no one else 
was holding them accountable 
and give a voice to the voiceless, 
however loud-mouthed it may 
be. And now this man makes a 
complete 180° to support the man 
who called African countries 
“shitholes,” 
who 
said 
there 
was “very fine people on both 
sides” after white nationalists 
attacked and even killed counter-
protestors in Charlottesville and 
who preferred the term “son of a 
bitch” for Colin Kaepernick and 
other NFL players who chose 
not to stand for an anthem that 
romanticizes a country doing 
little to fight against police 

brutality, racial injustice and 
systematic oppression.
Vocally 
and 
passionately 
supporting the president makes 
everything that Kanye had been 
saying for decades sound like 
an empty lie. Kanye West, once 
Yeezus, to many Lord and Savior, 
denied us three times, and many 
more after that.
However, on Oct. 30, supposed 
salvation arrived on the limbs of 
140 characters. Ye, his preferred 
name on Twitter, proclaimed 
he had “been used to spread 
messages (he doesn’t believe in)” 
and he was trading politics for a 
refocused creative spirit. Hip-
hop hypebeasts and the general 
public could finally breathe the 
collective sigh of relief; Kanye’s 
long national nightmare was 
over. Except, the Kanye we got 
back wasn’t the same one who 
left us.
Pre-2016, I was always one to 
speak out against Kanye slander, 
arguing that the man who many 
saw as just a narcissistic asshole 
was 
a 
complex 
artist 
with 
complex problems, overinflating 
his ego to try and cope with battles 
against anxiety and self-image all 
while pushing the envelope of 
modern rap and giving us radical 
genre-bending music. You could 
make a case for every album of 
his up to Yeezus as his best. But 
when push came to shove and 
the controversies centered less 
around the person and more 
their politics, I could no longer 
let Kanye off the hook. Defending 
him turned into an uphill battle 
with an exponential incline, and 
trying to push a boulder up it 
would cause unnecessary stress 
and harm to myself. I let it roll 
down the hill. I gave up on Kanye 
West, and you should too.
If there’s one thing though, at 
least he finally gave me an album 
I can assuredly place as his worst. 
Every valid criticism about The 
Life of Pablo and more can be 
applied to ye: unfocused, sloppy, 
forgettable. The gross lines are 
multiplied (“Let me hit it raw like 
fuck the outcome / ay, none of us 
would be here without cum” is 
about the deepest thought he can 
muster and “I pray your body’s 
draped more like mine and not 
like your mommy’s” is a mind-
boggling thing to say about your 
newborn daughter), the beats 
are stagnant and uninspired 
and there’s a puzzlingly high 
amount of Ty Dolla $ign and 
PARTYNEXTDOOR 
on 
the 
record. On songs like “I Thought 
About 
Killing 
You” 
West 
maunders about faux-highbrow, 
superficial philosophy, coming 
off as, for lack of a better word, 
a cringe-inducing edgelord and 
rapping version of the “Rick and 
Morty” high IQ copypasta.
For 
years, 
fans 
defiantly 
believed Kanye knew what he 
was doing, that behind his ever-
shifting, inflammatory persona 
was someone who could see all, 
do all, pull all the strings. Yet 
when their favorite artist started 

to support their least favorite 
political figure, he was being 
used. He was in the sunken place. 
He was now a hostage rather 
than a creation. In a Noisey 
article of similar caliber, the 
writer felt Kanye “made a deal 
with the devil,” that in return for 
being able to make Yeezus he had 
to turn over the keys. Make no 
mistake though, as every tweet 
Kanye ever sent, every pro-Trump 
statement he ever espoused was 
done willfully. Upholding this 
narrative of a Kanye possessed 
can only become more dangerous 
with time.
Still, this all makes me wonder 
if Kanye knew what he was doing 
in the first place. Did we all just 
vastly misinterpret his outbursts, 
his publicity stunts and his 
music as incomprehensible for 
us mere mortals instead of the 
lucky doings of a fool? Parroting 
Patrick Bateman’s rhetoric, there 
is an idea of a Kanye West, but no 
real Kanye.
I hope the one thing you take 
away from this article is to turn 
a blind eye to Kanye no longer, 
especially when, or even if, Yandhi 
is released. Not even considering 
his politics, the album just seems 
like a bad idea. With the title of 
Yeezus, West embraced his god-
like status, enveloped himself 
in it, but Yandhi sounds like the 
best the people responsible for 
the titles of the “Fast & Furious” 
franchise could come up with if 
given five minutes to think of a 
title for a sequel to Yeezus. The 
cover artwork feels lazy this time 
around, only adding color, a more 
intricate jewel case and a rainbow 
sheen to follow up an album 
defined by a lack of color and 
the dynamics of black and white. 
Now, I could be wrong, and he 
could return with the undisputed 
best album of his career, but even 
still, in no way would it be an 
act of redemption. The Kanye 
West we thought we knew and 
loved for so long is dead, and this 
bizarro husk of Kanye West we 
have in 2018 consciously killed 
him. Premeditated murder.
Kanye would be hard-pressed 
to find success on his second 
quest for perfection. Yeezus was 
the summation of a lifetime’s 
work, and the natural response 
to such a tight, dense work is 
release. With The Life of Pablo 
he did exactly that, but after 
Kanye rode that horse until it 
could go no more, for once in his 
life, he had no idea where to go 
next. ye was a wrong step in the 
alt-right direction, and trying to 
rekindle the flame of something 
as singular as Yeezus with Yandhi 
spells the end is “nigh.”
Returning to the gospel sample 
of “On Sight” five years later — 
“He’ll give us what we need / 
it may not be what we want” — 
more doubt is cast on the belief 
Kanye gave us what we needed 
with Yeezus. Now, he certainly 
isn’t giving us what we need, and, 
as much I hate to say it, he no 
longer knows what we want.

‘M’ finally through its 
early-season gauntlet

After 
winning 
its 
first 
four games of the season, the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team has since dropped three 
of its last four — including 
three games against ranked 
opponents. 
The Wolverines (5-3), who 
haven’t had a home game since 
Nov. 19, will finally play at the 
Crisler Center after spending 
the last week and a half on the 
road. Being on the road so much 
can certainly have an impact 
— 
especially 
with 
such 
a 
young team — 
according 
to 
Michigan coach 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico. 
“Definitely 
I 
think 
these 
past 
couple 
weeks 
were 
really 
difficult, 
sometimes 
you 
forget that,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Then you add a young team 
on top of the travel and then 
they’re 
like, 
‘My 
goodness 
coach, it’s exams, and we’re on 
the road.’ At the circle the other 
day, they were like, ‘We thought 
this was going to be the coolest 
thing, but really we just want to 
get back to the dorm so we can 
study for our exams.’ 
“So I think at Michigan 
academically, it’s so challenging 
that they’re just trying to stay 
afloat right now and try and be 
the best students they can be 
while at the same time be the 
best basketball players they can 
be.”
The Wolverines have had 
seven players log minutes in 
every game, four of whom 
are underclassmen: freshman 
guard Amy Dilk, freshman 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon, 

sophomore guard Deja Church 
and sophomore forward Hailey 
Brown. To say youth is a major 
part of this team’s identity in 
the young season would be an 
understatement. 
Barnes Arico, though, says 
she sometimes loses focus of 
her team’s inexperience and 
needs to remind herself that 
not all of her squad’s problems 
can be fixed right away. 
“You 
know 
sometimes 
I 
forget this, but the Marquette 
coach (Carolyn Kieger) said 
this to me: ‘It’s amazing how 
good your team is after you lost 
the program’s 
all-time 
leading scorer 
(Katelynn 
Flaherty),’ 
” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. “And then 
I 
sometimes 
look 
at 
our 
team and say 
‘Holy cow, we 
have 
Nicole 
Munger 
and Hallie Thome who are 
experienced kids and then 
we have all (these) kids that 
are trying to figure it out.’ … I 
sometimes need to have a little 
bit of patience with that.”
Michigan, which has four 
games remaining before the 
start of Big Ten play, will have 
the chance to get back on the 
winning track as all four of its 
upcoming opponents currently 
hold a combined record of 
just 5-26. This stretch begins 
Thursday when the Wolverines 
host LIU Brooklyn.
This stretch will be an 
important 
moment 
for 
the 
Michigan, as it will be the young 
players’ final opportunity to 
prepare 
themselves 
before 
conference 
play 
— 
when 
balancing youth and playing 
on the road will be the new 
normal.

“Definitely I 

think these past 

couple weeks 

were ... difficult.”

Hughes stars on offense, up-and-down on ‘D’

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
often says Quinn Hughes is 
worth the price of admission 
alone.
The sophomore defenseman 
— the No. 7 overall pick in the 
2018 NHL Draft — seems to have 
an eye-popping play in every 
game for the No. 14 Michigan 
hockey team. Whether he’s 
dangling the puck between a 
defender’s legs on a breakout 
or finding a teammate in the 
perfect spot for a goal, Hughes’ 
dynamic playmaking is key for 
the Wolverines.
In 
this 
weekend’s 
series 
against 
Michigan 
State, 
Hughes continued his trend of 
offensive production. As more 
of a two-way defenseman than 
a lockdown blueliner, Hughes 
is noted for his ability in the 
offensive zone.
In 
Friday 
night’s 
game 
at Munn Ice Arena in East 
Lansing, Hughes notched three 
assists — one on each goal 
Michigan scored for a season-
high tally. It’s his second three-
assist game this season and the 
third time he has scored three 
points in a night.
“It’s hard to prepare (for 
Hughes) because it’s not that 
it’s unorthodox, (but) he’s very 
creative,” said Michigan State 
coach Danton Cole. “He attacks 
you at different angles. He puts 
you on different things. You just 
have to be aware of him and you 
try not to get him loose. Quinn’s 
very good with the puck, and his 
feet are outstanding, and you 
throw an elite brain in there. … 
He’s fun watching play, and he’s 
hard to keep an eye on.”
The 
Spartans 
seemed 
to 
keep a better eye on Hughes on 
Saturday night as he tallied just 
one point. But it was a big one.
On the power play in the 
first period, Hughes sent a pass 
through all four of Michigan 
State’s penalty killers and found 
senior defenseman Nick Boka in 

the left circle. Boka’s slapshot 
beat the sprawling goaltender 
Drew DeRidder, and Michigan 
took the lead, 1-0.
“(Hughes) made an amazing 
pass,” Boka said. “I was just 
lucky to be in that far side and 
just try to get it to the goal, and 
lucky enough, it went in.”
Hughes 
now 
leads 
the 
Wolverines in points with 19 — 
two more than 
sophomore 
forward 
Josh 
Norris. 
His 
offensive 
production 
ranks 
ninth 
in the nation 
overall 
and 
ranks 
third 
among 
defensemen.
But 
on 
the defensive side of the ice, 
Hughes’ production hasn’t been 
as consistent.
In Friday’s game, he was on 
the ice for three of the Spartans’ 
four goals and he ranks last on 
the team in plus-minus with a 
minus-six rating.
“It is what it is,” Hughes said 
Friday. “Obviously, I don’t want 
to be on the ice for any goals, but 

I’ll go watch the tapes and I’ll 
look at it tomorrow. Hopefully, 
tomorrow, I can maybe have the 
three assists without being on 
the ice for any goals.”
While Hughes only had one 
assist Saturday, rather than the 
three he hoped for, his defensive 
skills were more prominent.
Late in the third period, 
the game was tied at one goal 
apiece. It seemed 
that 
at 
any 
moment 
either 
team could break 
the stalemate and 
win 
the 
game. 
Michigan 
State 
forward Tommy 
Apap was coming 
down the right 
side of the ice 
toward freshman 
goaltender 
Strauss Mann with just Hughes 
in between. Hughes skated 
in and broke up the play, 
preventing Apap from having 
a chance at the game-winning 
goal.
Minutes later in overtime, 
Hughes again prevented a goal, 
this time by poke-checking the 
puck away from forward Patrick 
Khodorenko.

“Hughes had a really solid 
game,” Pearson said. “He gives 
you everything he has, plays 
a lot of minutes and is a game 
breaker. 
He’s 
a 
difference 
maker. He’s worth the price of 
admission. You don’t have to be 
a hockey genius to walk in the 
building and see really who the 
best player is, the player who 
controls the play.”
While 
Hughes 
controlled 
the play Saturday, it came 
in contrast to his defensive 
performance Friday. Michigan 
as 
a 
whole 
was 
stronger 
defensively Saturday night, and 
Hughes’ increased effort may be 
the key.
Pearson has spoken numerous 
times this season about needing 
defensive 
commitment 
and 
consistency, 
and 
Saturday’s 
performance may well serve 
as a confidence boost for an 
often-maligned defense. The 
Wolverines held Michigan State 
to just 18 shots in regulation.
And while Hughes has lit 
up the stat sheet offensively, 
his defensive commitment has 
taken longer to come through.
But 
if 
he 
finds 
that 
consistency, 
it 
could 
be 
a 
difference-maker for Michigan.

Cecconi hopes postgame talk sends 
message to his Michigan teammates

When Joseph Cecconi sat 
down for a press conference 
after Saturday’s shootout loss to 
Michigan State, he was clearly 
disappointed in the weekend’s 
results.
The 
senior 
defenseman 
knew that the No. 15 Michigan 
hockey team had expected to 
come away with more than 
one point in two games against 
the 
Spartans, 
who entered the 
weekend 
firmly 
at the bottom of 
the Big Ten.
“We 
just 
talked 
to 
the 
team, 
it’s 
unacceptable,” 
Cecconi 
said 
Saturday. 
“It’s 
a 
big 
rivalry 
against Michigan 
State, and you want those six 
points and you only come out 
with one. (It’s) not where we 
wanted to go with that.”
The Wolverines have fought 
for 
team-wide 
commitment 
throughout 
this 
season. 
It 
was 
this 
weekend’s 
series, 
however, that may have been 
the proverbial last straw for 
Cecconi. According to Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson, Cecconi 
doesn’t speak his mind to the 
team very often, despite being 
its captain.
But 
after 
this 
weekend’s 
series, he had something to say.
“After the game, me and the 
other captains and then (senior 
forward) Brendan Warren, we 
all had a little bit of information, 
our little piece of mind that we 
wanted to let the team know,” 
Cecconi said. “The weekend 
was unacceptable in all of our 
minds, and we just wanted to 
talk and figure some things out. 
Lay a foundation and things 
like that, just so we know our 
expectations going into next 
weekend.”
The expectations, both from 
Cecconi and from Pearson, are 
fairly simple. Each member 

of the team needs to buy in to 
Pearson’s system and commit to 
team defense.
Both player and coach believe 
that once individual buy-in 
comes, the consistency will 
follow and Michigan will start 
to perform at the level it was 
expected to when the season 
began.
“We have a lot of skilled 
players,” Cecconi said. “We 
might need some of them to buy 
into the system a little bit more. 
Same with the 
younger 
guys, 
same 
with 
pretty 
much 
everyone. 
Everyone needs 
to get on the 
same 
page 
and once that 
happens, we’re 
gonna be a very 
good 
team, 
because 
we 
have the skill.”
Getting players to buy in to 
the system has been something 
Pearson 
has 
talked 
about 
since the first game of the 
year. Especially now that the 
Wolverines are facing some 
adversity, it seems that is more 
important than ever.
“We still have to get the buy-
in from everybody,” Pearson 
said. “I think we’re still — 
sometimes when things aren’t 

going your way, you try to take 
things into your own hands 
and not just play within the 
systems and what not. We have 
competitors, and they want to 
win. They have to understand 
that we just gotta keep playing 
together and then we’ll be 
okay.”
The Wolverines are now in 
a similar place to where they 
were last season at this time. 
They haven’t won a game since 
Nov. 16, but each game has been 
close. One of the losses came in 
overtime, two came in shootouts 
and one was in regulation. All 
were decided by one goal.
Last 
year, 
they 
started 
stringing 
wins 
together 
in 
January and ended up in the 
Frozen Four. It was then-
captain Tony Calderone who 
called the team together at 
that time and told them that 
they needed to start winning or 
they wouldn’t make the NCAA 
Tournament.
This year, Cecconi hopes 
he’s the one that turns things 
around.
“I think he had the whole 
team and just told them that 
winning can become a habit, but 
so can mediocrity, and we just 
want to make sure that doesn’t 
— they just don’t accept that,” 
Pearson said. “I think that’s 
what he’s trying to say, and 
that’s our message to them.”

With OSU loss in past, Michigan looks forward

Growing 
up, 
Josh 
Metellus’smother 
would 
tell 
him not to set his expectations 
higher than reality. 
“You’re always going to (get) 
let down when you do that,” the 
junior safety explained Monday 
afternoon, 
“because 
you’re 
never going to reach those goals 
you really, really want.”
The expectations — those 
goals Michigan really, really 
wanted — are off the table now. 
There’s no Big Ten title for the 
Wolverines, nor an upcoming 
College 
Football 
Playoff 
appearance. 
Instead, 
reality 
came crashing down 10 days ago 
in Columbus, and now, players 
are left picking up the pieces.
Perhaps 
anti-climactically, 
the season will end in the Peach 
Bowl in Atlanta, Ga., on Dec. 
29 against No.10 Florida — an 
opponent the Wolverines will 
have faced three of the last four 
years.
“We had a lot of big goals 
— 
National 
Championship 
goals — at the beginning of 
the year. Obviously those now 

are unattainable,” said junior 
guard Ben Bredeson. “But we’re 
definitely very motivated to try 
to win that last game.”
Bredeson insisted the mood 
around the team has stayed 
positive. Some guys, he says, will 
sear the pain of the 62-39 loss to 
Ohio State in their memories, 
pooling it for motivation in 
the years to come. Bredeson, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
watched 
the game once, 
picked out what 
he did well and 
what 
he 
did 
poorly, 
then 
moved along. He 
found no use in 
dwelling.
“Nobody came 
here 
with 
this 
gloomy, drowned 
face,” said redshirt junior tackle 
Jon Runyan “… We know what 
happened, we’ve got to move 
forward from that, pick each 
other up, and go forward and 
get this win that everybody 
wants. That’s the cure for it, 
another win.”
For 
the 
most 
part, 
attention has shifted past the 

demoralizing loss and toward 
the future. Junior defensive 
end Rashan Gary has already 
declared for the NFL Draft and 
decided he will not play in the 
bowl game. Ben Bredeson all but 
said Monday he’d be returning 
to school next year, though 
“it’s not official,” he clarified. 
And wide receivers coach Jim 
McElwain 
was 
announced 
Monday as the 
next head coach 
at 
Central 
Michigan.
More 
decisions 
— 
most 
notably 
from 
junior 
linebacker 
Devin 
Bush, 
junior 
cornerbacks 
Lavert 
Hill 
and David Long, and junior 
quarterback Shea Patterson — 
are likely forthcoming.
Despite the moving parts, 
players insist that winning the 
Peach Bowl is important for this 
team and for the trajectory of 
the program. Michigan has won 
one bowl game in the last seven 
years.

“It 
matters. 
We’re 
really 
sick of losing the last game of 
the year,” Bredeson said. “This 
team, we’ve had adversity worse 
than any team I’ve been on since 
I’ve been here. So if there’s one 
group that will bounce back and 
get a big win at the end of the 
year, I think it’ll be this one.”
Prior to Harbaugh’s arrival 
in 
2015, 
Michigan 
hadn’t 
finished with double-digit wins 
in back-to-back seasons since 
2002-2003. With 10 wins, the 
Wolverines have done so in 
three of the last four seasons. 
Against Florida, Michigan will 
go for 11 wins for the first time 
since 2011.
“We’ve lost to two rivals and 
everyone tries to make it out 
like we had a bad year, but we 
finished 10-2,” Bredeson said. 
“It’s not the year everybody 
wanted, but it’s a great year 
nonetheless, and I think we 
really just need to cap this off 
with a great bowl win, and 
everybody will remember it as a 
great year.”
Others might beg to differ.
But, really, in the end it’s all 
relative to expectations. Just 
ask Josh Metellus’ mother.

Now the ‘hunted’, the Wolverines 
prepare to take on Northwestern

Three hundred and one days 
ago, the Michigan men’s basketball 
team fell at Northwestern.
The 
Wolverines 
entered 
Allstate Arena on Feb. 6, 2018 still 
searching for consistency, their 
NCAA Tournament berth still far 
from secure. Despite this, they fell 
flat on their faces, putting forth 40 
minutes of sluggish, uninspired 
basketball in a 61-52 loss to a 
Wildcat team that would finish 
10th in the Big Ten.
Michigan hasn’t lost a regular 
season game since.
The last 301 days have been a 
whirlwind, and the Wolverines 
have 
blown 
away 
almost 
everything in their path. They 
won the Big Ten Tournament as a 
fifth seed and made it all the way 
to the National Championship 
Game, losing to a historically 
great 
Villanova 
team. 
In 
a 
November rematch this season, 
they clobbered the defending 
national champions.
Michigan is 8-0 and sits at 
fifth in the most recent AP Top 
25 Poll. Wednesday, it drubbed 
No. 11 North Carolina. Saturday’s 
victim was No. 19 Purdue. The 
Wolverines have won every game 
this season by at least 17 points.
Thus, 
Tuesday’s 
matchup 
with Northwestern in Evanston 
couldn’t 
look 
more 
different 
than it did last year. As Michigan 
prepares for its second true road 
game of the season, it sits firmly 
in the national conversation. The 
target on the Wolverines’ backs 
is bigger than it has been in quite 
some time.
“I don’t think when we went to 
Villanova we were the ‘hunted’,” 
said Michigan coach John Beilein 
on Monday. “ … Now we are, so 
we’re going to have to be that 

type of team that’s going to go 
on the road, knowing that you 
come in there with that target on 
your back. … The other team’s got 
extra juice when you’re playing a 
highly-rated team.”
Northwestern 
fits 
the 
definition of “trap game” to a 
tee. Last season’s loss, while 
a 
disappointment 
for 
the 
Wolverines, was hardly new — 
it’s been five years since they won 
there. Tip-off is set for 9:00 pm, 
and Beilein has previously noted 
the challenge of such late-night 
games for players. The Wildcats’ 
home arena, the 7,039-seat Welsh-
Ryan Arena, reopened this season 
after renovations, and Beilein 
expects a vocal, capacity crowd to 
greet his team.
Meanwhile, 
Northwestern 
appears to be somewhat improved 
from last season, at least in the 
early going. The Wildcats sit 
6-2 and No. 46 in KenPom, up 
from 85th last season. While 
one of their losses was a 19-point 
blowout at the hands of Fresno 
State, the other was a down-to-
the-wire defeat at Indiana this 
Saturday.
Northwestern 
will 
mostly 
rely on two key players. Forward 
Vic Law — a former high school 
teammate of Michigan guard 
Charles Matthews — scores 17.6 
points and records 2.8 assists 
per game, leading the team in 
both categories, while hitting 
44.7 percent of his treys. Dererk 
Pardon, the Wildcats’ starting 
center for the last two seasons, 
averages close to a double-double.
“They’re 
playing 
a 
little 
differently,” Beilein said. “They’re 
playing mostly man-to-man right 
now, they played almost all zone 
last year. Really aggressive man-
to-man. Their offense is quick, 
it’s crisp, it’s good. They just had 
a bad game against Fresno, but 

other than that, they were ahead 
40-20 on an ACC team (Georgia 
Tech) at halftime. So they’ve got 
a lot of tools there, and I expect 
it’s going to be a really difficult 
game.”
Beilein’s top priority leading 
up to Northwestern has been 
preparing for the intangibles. 
That means making sure his team 
is ready to take on the specific 
challenges that conference road 
games pose — in particular, “trap” 
games like Tuesday night — and 
ensuring his team is aware it will 
receive everyone’s best shot for 
the rest of the year.
“We went into that hornet’s 
nest at Villanova and played well, 
but we gotta go do that again and 
I don’t think you ever get used to 
that. You never go win there and 
say, ‘This is normal,’ ” Beilein said. 
“ … Handling the crowd, handling 
another away game, a Big Ten 
game, that’s probably the biggest 
thing.”
For 
all 
Michigan 
has 
achieved in the season’s first 
four weeks, Tuesday represents 
its 
culmination. 
Win 
at 
Northwestern, and the Wolverines 
will have shown they can do so as 
the hunters and the hunted alike. 
Win at Northwestern, and they’ll 
make a statement that normally 
wouldn’t be made following a win 
over a middle-of-the-pack Big Ten 
team.
The reason why? It’s been 
a while since Michigan’s been 
hunted like this.
“Coach 
(Beilein) 
talked 
about just staying humble,” said 
sophomore forward Isaiah Livers. 
“We’re going to have a big target 
on our back just because we went 
to the national championship and 
did what we did last year.
“ … Everybody’s going to be 
coming for us, we just got to be 
ready.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL

‘M’ finishes fifth at the 
Cliff Keen Invitational

It was as dramatic an ending as 
anyone could’ve hoped for.
The bout neared its final 
moments and redshirt junior 
174-pounder 
Myles 
Amine 
desperately clung to a one-point 
lead 
over 
Missouri’s 
Daniel 
Lewis. It was the championship 
match at the Cliff Keen Las Vegas 
(CKLV) Invitational — arguably 
collegiate wrestling’s toughest 
tournament outside of the NCAA 
Championships — and Amine 
wanted the crown.
Using a strong approach on 
top, Lewis controlled Amine for 
the majority of the third period, 
close to securing the additional 
one point of riding time to send 
the match to overtime. Wanting 
to end the bout in regulation and 
seal his place as one of the weight 
classes’ most feared competitors, 
Amine took advantage of some 
awkward positioning to score a 
two-point reversal right at the 
match’s close. The clock read 
zeros, and Amine had once again 
downed a ranked opponent.
Strung 
along 
by 
Amine’s 
heroics, the Michigan wrestling 
team (2-0) placed fifth at the 
tournament despite lackluster 
outings from a few of the team’s 
other contributors. For Amine, 
though, this victory was a long 
time coming after he placed 
third in the last two years’ CKLV 
Invitationals.
“It feels really good to be able 
to bring home one,” Amine said. 
“Placing third the last two times, 
it’s kind of a bittersweet taste 
when you finish winning your 
last match, but you still feel like 
you came up short.”
Besides 
Amine, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Kanen 
Storr, 
redshirt junior Logan Massa 
and sophomore Drew Mattin 
all had solid outings in Vegas, 
placing third, fourth and fifth, 
respectively.
Despite 
entering 
as 
the 
tournament’s top seed and fifth-
ranked wrestler nationally, Massa 
finished fourth after dropping 
two 
close 
matches. 
In 
the 
semifinal match, Massa fell to the 

eventual champion, Nebraska’s 
Isaiah White — an opponent he 
defeated at last year’s dual meet.
As the two wrestlers went 
head-to-head, the match ended 
up being one of the tournament’s 
closest, with Massa falling 6-2. 
On two separate occasions, Massa 
had White dead to rights on two 
takedown attempts, but due to 
some awkward positioning, he 
was unable to secure the points.
Despite the losses, getting 
experience 
wrestling 
ranked 
opponents is crucial for the 
Wolverines, 
particularly 
this 
early in the season, and there’s no 
better place to get that experience 
than at the CKLV Invitational.
With ten ranked wrestlers 
per weight class for a total of 110 
wrestlers out of 200 possible, the 
road to the finals leads through 
multiple ranked opponents.
Win or lose, Michigan used the 
meet as an opportunity to both 
demonstrate its dominance and to 
see what areas need improvement. 
As a team, Bormet asserts that his 
team needs to develop in two key 
areas — mental composure and 
bottom positioning.
“There’s always a lot of mental 
errors to work on, just composure 
and wrestling wide open in 
all three positions, so there’s a 
certain mental component to 
it,” Bormet said. “Then from a 
technical standpoint, I think 
we need to continue to improve 
our set-ups on bottom position 
wrestling a little as a team.”
Seemingly having the least 
room for improvement, Amine 
insists there is still work to be 
done even while basking in his 
most recent achievement.
“It’s good to see all the hard 
work and dedication that I’ve 
put into the room this summer 
and am continuously putting in 
is starting to pay off,” Amine said. 
“And so yeah, it means a lot, but 
at the same time, it’s right back to 
the drawing board. The season’s 
far from over. It’s a big stepping 
stone, but still a lot to improve 
on.”
