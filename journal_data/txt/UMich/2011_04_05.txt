how to handle a Freedom of

filed with the University on
March 17 seeking the release of
personal work e-mails of faculty
in labor studies departments.
The FOIA request was filed
with the University by the

Mich. - to obtain e-mails that
contain information regarding
the public union dispute in Wis-

consin. Similar requests have
also been filed with Michigan
State University and Wayne
State University.
Specifically, the request
sought e-mails containing the
words "Wisconsin," "Scott
Walker" or "Maddow" - return-
ing to the Republican Wisconsin
governor and MSNBC talk show
host rachel Maddow. This fol-
lows the Wisconsin Republican
Party's FOIA request for the

'U' Forestry Crew lights it up

Summer weather is still a few
months away, but for a few areas
on campus, the temperature is
already burning hot.
For the past three or four years,
the Forestry Crew of University
Plant Operations Grounds Servic-
es has organized controlled burns
of plants around campus to pre-
vent flora diseases.
In addition to the controlled
burns, the Forestry Crew - which
is in charge of thousands of trees
on campus - also takes care of
plant health through activities
such as inspections, disease pre-
vention, removal and replanting
and pest management.
Until April 10, the planned
burns will take place at the wood-
ed lots next to the Inglis House

estate, the grassland near Burs-
ley Residence Hall and the Bent-
ley Library wildflower garden,
according to the University Hous-
ing website. Several of the loca-
tions have been diagnosed with
invasive species and the burns are
supposed to eliminate them.
North Campus is the only site
where the University implements
burnings, and controlled burns
for specific locations occur every
two or three years, according to
Jane Immonen, a forestry spe-
cialist for Grounds Services. The
burns mostly take place around
the woodlands and are necessary
for plant health, she said.
The University hires a group
of about six to eight controlled
burn professionals to use flam-

mable fuel in specified areas and
oversee the procedure, Immonen
said. The weather also plays an
important role in the process, as
low wind and high humidity are
essential factors for its execution,
she said.
The fire is ignited only on
ground areas where there are
leaves and sticks that don't burn at
a very high temperature. This pre-
vents the trees from catching on
fire, Immonen said. The process
takes a few hours and causes drift-
ing smoke, but is often carried out
when few people are around, she
said. Immonen added that care-
ful implementations of the process
have prevented problems from
occurring in previous years.

Libyan rebels reject role
for any of Gadhafi's sons

Italy becomes third
country to officially
recognize rebel gov't
ISTANBUL (AP) - A diplomat-
ic push by Moammar Gadhafi's
regime ran into trouble yesterday
as opponents at home and abroad
rejected any solution to the Libyan
conflict that would involve one of
his sons taking power.
While a Gadhafi envoy lobbied
diplomats in European capitals,
Italy became the third nation to
declare that the rebels' interim
council in Libya is the only legiti-
mate voice for the people of the
North African nation.
The diplomatic whirlwind could
signal a softening of his regime's
hardline public stance against any
compromise that would end the
fighting and steer Libya toward a
political resolution.
Any long-term settlement poses
tough questions about the fate of
Gadhafi's family and the new lead-
er of a post-Gadhafi nation.
Some of Gadhafi's adversar-
ies quickly rejected the idea that
any of his powerful sons, some of
whom command militias accused
of attacks on civilians, might play

a transitional leadership role that
would undoubtedly protect the
family's vast economic interests.
Gadhafi, who took power in a
1969 coup, has a legacy of brutality
and involvement in terrorism but
was able to prolong his rule and
even emerge from pariah status
over the past decade with the help
of Libya's immense oil wealth.
Potential rivals to the eccentric
leader were sidelined during four
decades of harsh rule based on
personal and tribal loyalties that
undermined the army and other
national institutions.
In Rome, Foreign Minister
Franco Frattini welcomed Ali
al-Essawi, the foreign envoy of
the Libyan National Transitional
Council, which was hastily set up
in the eastern, rebel-held city of
Benghazi as the uprising against
Gadhafi began in February.
"We have decided to recognize
the council as the only political,
legitimate interlocutor to repre-
sent Libya," Frattini told report-
ers. He said he will send an envoy
to Benghazi, Libya's second-larg-
est city, in the coming days.
Frattini also insisted that Gad-
hafi and his family must go.
"Any solution for the future
of Libya has a precondition: that


Gadhafi's regime leaves ... that
Gadhafi himself and the family
leave the country," Frattini said.
Italy is the third country, after
France and Qatar, to give diplo-
matic recognition to the rebel
council, despite international con-
cerns about the unity, origin and
ultimate intentions of the opposi-
tion. Its leaders have said they are
committed to democratic reform,
but U.S. lawmakers have cau-
tioned that the allies need to know
more about them before providing
them with any weapons to fight
Gadhafi's forces.
Al-Essawi said one possible
idea - replacing Gadhafi with one
of his sons - was unacceptable.
In Benghazi, opposition spokes-
woman Iman Bughaigis also said
the rebels would not accept any
solution that included Gadhafi or
his sons.
"This war has shown everyone
and the world that Gadhafi's sons
are no different from him," Bug-
haigis said. "They are two sides of
the same coin. Gadhafi has been
waging a war on our people with
the help of his sons' militias and
mercenaries, so we see no dif-
ference between them. There
is no way to negotiate with this
regime."

UConn wins national championship

Connecticut beats
Butler, 53-41, to
claim third title in
program history
HOUSTON (AP) - The only
thing that could stop Kemba
Walker and Connecticut's amaz-
ing run was the final buzzer.
On a night when the massive
arena felt like a dusty old gym,
UConn made Butler look like
the underdog it really was, win-
ning the national championship
last night with an old-fashioned,
grinding 53-41 beatdown of the

Bulldogs.
Walker finished with 16 points
for the Huskies (32-9), who won
their 11th straight game since
closing the regular season with a
9-9 Big East record that foreshad-
owed none of this.
They closed it out with a defen-
sive showing for the ages, holding
Butler to a 12-for-64 shooting.
That's 18.8 percent, the worst
ever in a title game.
It was one of the ugliest games
anyone can remember on the
sport's biggest stage. But defi-
nitely the kind of game a grizzled
old coach like Jim Calhoun could
love.
At age 68, he became the oldest

coach to win the NCAA champi-
onship and joined John Wooden,
Adolph Rupp, Mike Krzyzewski
and Bob Knight as only the fifth
coach to win three NCAA titles.
"It maybe the happiest moment
of my life," Calhoun said.
Calhoun coaxed this win out of
his team by accepting the reality
that the rim looked about as wide
as a pancake on a cold-shooting,
defensive-minded night in Hous-
ton. He did it by making his play-
ers pound the ball inside and
insisting on the kind of defense
that UConn played during this
remarkable run, but which often
got overshadowed by Walker's
theatrics.

Fuselage tore open
as plane was in
flight on Friday
PHOENIX (AP) - Federal
aviation officials readied an
order yesterday for emergency
inspections on 80 U.S-regis-
tered Boeing 737 jetliners like
the one on which a piece of fuse-
lage tore open more than 30,000
feet above Arizona last week.
The order, to be issued Tues-
day, is aimed at finding weak-
nesses in the metal in the
fuselage, but virtually all of
the affected aircraft will have
already been inspected by the
time the order takes effect.
A 5-foot-long hole opened up
in the roof of the Southwest Air-
lines plane soon after takeoffFri-
day from Phoenix, causing a loss
of pressure and forcing pilots to
make an emergency landing 125
miles to the southwest in Yuma,
Ariz. No one was seriously hurt.
The safety directive applies
to about 175 aircraft worldwide,
including 80 planes registered

in the U.S., the Federal Aviation
Administration said. Of those
80, nearly all are operated by
Southwest. Two belong to Alas-
ka Airlines.
After the midair incident,
Southwest grounded nearly 80
Boeing 737-300s for inspec-
tions. By Monday evening. 64
were cleared to return to the
skies, but three were found with
cracks similar to those found on
the Arizona plane.
Friday's incident, however,
raised questions about the
impact that frequent takeoffs
and landings by short-haul car-
riers like Southwest put on their
aluminum-skinned aircraft and
the adequacy of the inspections.
Cracks can develop from the
constant cycle of pressurizing
the cabin for flight, then releas-
ing the pressure upon landing.
Since there had been no pre-
vious accidents or major inci-
dents involving metal fatigue in
the middle part of the fuselage,
Boeing maintenance procedures
called only for airlines to per-
form a visual inspection.

But airlines, manufactur-
ers and federal regulators have
known since at least 1988 that
planes can suffer microscopic
fractures. That year, an 18-foot
section of the upper cabin of an
Aloha Airlines 737-200 peeled
away in flight, sucking out a
flight attendant.
The order is "certainly a step
in the right direction," said
National Transportation Safety
Board member Robert Sumwalt,
who is in Yuma with the board's
accident investigation team.
The FAA's emergency order
will require initial inspections
using electromagnetic devices
on some Boeing 737 aircraft in
the -300, -400 and -500 series
that have accumulated more
than 30,000 takeoffs and land-
ings. It will require repetitive
inspections at regular intervals.
Southwest's jet was 15 years
old and had logged 39,000 pres-
surization cycles, a measure-
ment of the number of takeoffs
and landings. That's 7.2 cycles
every day for every year it has
been in service.

Two Lansing parents are due
in court on accusations that they

and a 7-year-old classmate.
Police say the boys got in a fight
at Lyons Elementary School last

House GOP plans
third stopgap bill
to avoid shutdown
With budget talks deadlocked,
* House Republicans readied a
week-long bill to cut spending
by as much as $12 billion while
averting a government shutdown
threatened for Friday, officials
disclosed Monday night.
The measure also would
include enough money to operate
the Defense Department through
the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year,
the officials added.
They said House Speaker John
Boehner, R-Ohio, told the rank
and file in a closed-door meeting
he would seek passage of the bill
if it became clear it was necessary
to avoid shutting the government
down.
He presented the plan at the
end of a day marked by increasing

acrimony in negotiations involving
the Obama administration, Senate
Democrats and Republicans.
SANAA, Yemen
At least 15 dead
after police shoot at
Yemeni protesters
Military forces and police
snipers opened fire yesterday on
marchers calling for the ouster
of Yemen's embattled president,
killing at least 15 people and
sending a strong message of defi-
ance to U.S. and European envoys
seeking to broker a peace deal
after months of bloodshed.
The melee in the southern city
of Taiz - part of an intensifying
crackdown on the opposition -
underscored the resolve of Presi-
dent Ali Abdullah Saleh to cling
to power even as protest crowds
resist withering attacks and cru-
cial allies switch sides and call for
his 32-year rule to end.
It also showed the challenges
facing behind-the-scenes diplo-
matic efforts to quell the nearly
two-month-old uprising in a

mation will serve as a means to
expand the group's programs in
the city.
"I think it's a really good step
toward broadening our outreach
beyond (not) just campus, but to
the entire Ann Arbor city," Par-
rish said. "It's good to know we

PANHELLENIC AND MSA
REPS. ADDRESS COUNCIL
ABOUT LIGHTING ISSUES
In light of increased crime in
off-campus areas, two repre-
sentatives from the Panhellenic
Association and the Michigan
Student Assembly Student Safety
Commission were present at city
counciltodiscuss their concerns
regarding street lighting near
campus.
In their addresses to council,
LSA senior Katie Rosenberg, for-
mer Panhel president, and LSA
sophomore Stephanie Hamel,
vice chair of the MSA Student
Safety Commission, appealed to
the city to work with the Uni-
versity and Greek community
to improve lighting on and near
campus.
Rosenberg and Hamel serve
on the Student Safety Commis-
sion, which was recently formed
by MSA to work with University
administrators and public safety
officials to increase campus safe-
ty, and encourage awareness of
resources on campus.
Rosenberg said two recent
armed robberies in the Oxford
area have raised concern in the
Greek community, since 13 fra-
ternities and sororities are locat-
ed in the neighborhood. She said
Panhel and the Interfraternity
Council have allocated funding

for fraternities and sororities to
install lights on trees in the areas

University's William Davidson
Institute at the time.
"It's always been true of
board members that they do not
participate in any topic in which
they would have any personal or
professional conflict of interest,"
Dearing said.
Fitzgerald said Lampe's deci-
sion to serve on the editorial
board is a personal issue.
"People engage in their com-
munities on a lot of different lev-
els," Fitzgerald said. "Whether
it's a short-term assignment like
this on an editorial board or sit-
ting on a board of directors for
a non-profit organization, those
are all individual decisions peo-
ple make about how they want
to use their time and how they
want to engage in the commu-
nity."
Lampe could not be reached
for comment after several
attempts by The Michigan Daily.
Dearing said Lampe was
approached to be part of the
editorial board because he
brings insight as a former jour-
nalist. Dearing wrote in an
e-mail interview that members
are invited to join the editorial
board based on their involve-
ment in and knowledge of the
Ann Arbor community.
"He brings an interesting
surrounding their houses.
Hamel told council that the
city had already replaced stan-
dard street lights in areas sur-
rounding South Forest Avenue,
Hill Street, Packard Street and
Wells Street in a collaborative
effort with DTE energy. She
added that the venture is project-
ed to save the city about $5,500
in annual costs.
Hamel asked council to con-
sider an additional contract with
DTE that would replace Oxford's
lights with LED lighting. Hamel
noted that because LED lights
are brighter, they can better illu-
minate areas.
"Money spent in this invest-
ment to convert the lights would
go a long way in both making
students feel safer walking at
night in that area and making
dark neighborhoods brighter for
motorists," Hamel said.
In an interview before the
meeting, Rosenberg said while it
would be ideal to add new light
fixtures to the area, budget con-
straints and a current city mora-
torium deters the installation of
new streetlights.
Hamel said the DTE part-
nership overcame those barri-
ers because DTE subsidized the
streetlight installations. She said
student organizations like MSA
would be willing to aid a project
to replace lights in other areas
including Oxford.
"We just want to see some-
thing happen in the area," Hamel
said.
CITY COUNCIL REJECTS
PROPOSAL FOR HOTEL AND
CONFERENCE CENTER
While an underground park-
ing garage is stillunder construc-
tion at 319 South Fifth Ave., what
will be built above the structure
is yet to be determined.
Council voted to reject a letter

of intent from New York-based
development group Valiant Part-

voice to issues that we discuss
that have nothing to do with the
University," Dearing said. "If we
were to discuss a topic that had
anything to do with the Uni-
versity, he would not be at that
meeting or be involved in that
process at all."
In addition to his experience
in public relations, Lampe has
masters degrees in journalism
and mechanical engineering.
Dearing said AnnArbor.com
maintains a "firm difference"
between news coverage and
editorials, and board members
aren't paid for their work.
He added that the public
has expressed concerns about
conflicts of interest regarding
AnnArbor.com's editorial board
members in the past. However,
Dearing said board members
always recuse themselves from
discussing a topic or organiza-
tion they are involved in.
He cited former board mem-
ber Bob Guenzel, who was a
Washtenaw County administra-
tor. Guenzel wasn't involved in
the deliberations on editorials
about the Washtenaw County
commissioner, Dearing said.
Likewise, Dearing said
Lampe's presence on the board
won't influence news coverage
of the University.
ners, which proposed to build a
hotel and conference center on
the property.
Several members of the pub-
lic addressed the council on the
subject, and many demanded
that the area be made into a pub-
lic space, like a park, rather than
developed by a private company.
City Council member Chris-
topher Taylor (D-Ward 3) said
he was dissatisfied with the pro-
posed hotel and conference cen-
ter.
"The process has borne a fruit
that we're not interested in con-
suming," Taylor said.
City Council member Sandi
Smith (D-Ward 1) said she sup-
ported the resolution to reject
the proposal, noting that the city
needs to be careful in accepting
proposals by developers.
"When you put something
out to the market in the worst
possible times-you're going
to get somebody who's going
to respond in a way ... they're
going to see what they can get,"
Smith said. "They're testing the
waters to see how desperate we
are."
Hieftje said University offi-
cials expressed no interest in
using the proposed building's
facilities and that a lack of Uni-
versity involvement would give
the proposal "a very low chance
of being successful."
In response to community
members who appealed to coun-
cil to make the area a public
space, Hieftje said the city cur-
rently has 157 parks with a com-
bined acreage that surpasses the
entire land area of the University
campus. He said because of the
unusually high value of the prop-
erty, it is important that the city
continues to look toward private
developers.
"The reason for that final
resolve clause is to let people
know that this isn't the place for

a vast park covering that piece of
land," Hieftje said.

FOIA
From Page 1
Scarnecchia distributed a let-
ter from John Dowling, senior
university legal counsel at the
University of Wisconsin, to
Stephan Thompson, the mem-
ber of the Wisconsin GOP who
filed the records request for
Cronon's e-mails. The letter out-
lined what criteria Dowling was
planning to include in the FOIA
request.
Scarnecchia said Michigan's
FOIA law is different from Wis-
consin's in terms of what infor-
mation can be exempted, since in
Michigan information in e-mails
considered "private," "prelimi-
nary" or "advisory" would be
blocked out in response to a
request.
Following her presentation,
SACUA members and guests
voiced their concerns about what
the records request meant for
University faculty.
SACUA Secretary John
Lehman, a professor of ecology
and evolutionary biology, asked
Scarnecchia if she knew how
far back the University's e-mail
archive went and if faculty mem-
bers were expected to search the
entire system for the request.
Scarnecchia responded that the
amount of e-mails saved varies
among schools and that time and
funding restrictions make the
amount of searching necessary
to respond to each record request
different.
Peggie Hollingsworth, presi-
dent of the Academic Freedom
Lecture Fund, said at the meet-
ing the situation is reminiscent of
McCarthyismbecause the records
requests is intended to find out if
Cronon had violated a Wisconsin
law barring state employees from
using state-funded resources, like
their work e-mail, for partisan
political reasons.
"I don't think you can talk
about academic freedom without
talking about freedom of speech,"
Hollingsworth said.
SACUA Chair Ed Rothman, a
University professor of statistics,
motioned for the committee to
submit a recommendation to the
Civil Liberties Board at the Uni-
versity in response to the FOIA-
request that will express their
feelings on the matter. Other
SACUA members seconded the
motion.
"If we let this simply slide by

Tuesday, April 5, 2011 - 3
we will not be serving our com-
munity well," Rothman said
SACUA DISCUSSES
POTENTIAL CHANGES TO
TRESPASS RULES
Scarnecchia also distributed a
summary of the University's cur-
rent trespass policy and a set of
proposed changes to the policy to
members at yesterday's meeting.
She said she was reviewing the
policy at the request of Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman
following several recent high-
profile cases, including former
Michigan assistant attorney gen-
eral Andrew Shirvell's ban from
some University premises follow-
ing his alleged stalking of Michi-
gan Student Assembly President
Chris Armstrong.
According to Scarnecchia, the
University issued an estimated
2,000 trespass orders over the
last decade, one of which was
the alleged forcible resigna-
tion of former University Prof.
Andrei Borisov - a case in which
SACUA's Faculty Hearing Com-
mittee issued a 55-page report
last year claiming University offi-
cials had violated Borisov's rights
and academic freedoms.
Scarnecchia said trespass
orders are only issued to individu-
als affiliated with the University
under "exceptional" circumstanc-
es when safety is threatened.
SACUA Vice Chair Gina Poe,
an associate professor of anes-
thesiology and molecular and'
integrative physiology, said she
thinks the proposed 30-day time
lapse before an individual issued
a trespass order can appeal the
charge should be shortened
because University employees
can't be away from their work for
30 days without facing serious
setbacks.
Scarnecchia said there is not
currently a time set for request-
ing an appeal and a shorter peri-
od is negotiable. However, policy
allows for a review of the issued
trespass order within 24 hours,
during which the decision can be
speedily overturned.
Rothman said speediness is
not the only issue he has with the
current appeal process. He said
he dislikes that the appeal goes
through the chief of the Depart-
ment of Public Safety and sug-
gested that a small committee
be formed for "expeditious" and
"confidential" overturn of tres-
pass issues.

Share the wealth
Committee unfairly allocated student funds
recent allocation of student funds toward a community
service trip for a select group of North Quad residents
has many students upset. Members of the North
Quadrangle Committee for International Impact may have
had good intentions, but their decision to set aside $2,000
for a community service trip to Peru - involving mostly
members of their committee - was a misuse of student funds.
Community service in developing countries is an activity that
should be encouraged, but there is a clear conflict of interest
in this situation. Funding service trips for a small group of
students is beyond the purview of a residence hall council.

0

According to a March 31 Daily article, the
North Quad Committee on International
Impact and the Residence Hall Association
recently voted to spend more than $6,000 on a
trip for 14 students to go to Peru this summer
- to help school children. Of the 14 going on the
trip, nine are onthe International Impact Com-
mittee. Of the 450 North Quad residents, all of
whom contribute to the committee's funds as
a part of their room and board, only 14 will
actively engage in community outreach as a
result of this spending.
It is upsetting that thousands of dollars of
community funds were allocated to help a few
students. Members of the committee must
recognize that their primary duty is to the
residents of North Quad, who could have used
the money for community building events and
activities. A tangible goal could be to foster a
climate of tolerance and diversity within the
residence hall. And an international impact is
possible without a trip to Peru. The commit-
tee could have used the money to jumpstart
fundraising efforts for similar causes which
could have involved more residents and raised
greater awareness about internationally rel-
evant issues.

There was a clear conflict of interest in this
situation. Students on the committee have
argued that it made sense for those organiz-
ing the trip to participate and that they would
share their experiences with the rest of the
residence hall through presentations. But it's
difficult to believe that the trip doesn't benefit
the participants disproportionately, since they
receive the majority of the first hand experi-
ence. Perhaps the allocation would have been
less controversial had nine of the 14 partici-
pants not been members of the council that
voted to fund the trip.
Students should also be more involved in
the activities of their residence hall. Building
a vibrant community takes effort, but being a
member of a thriving one can be an enriching
experience. Residents should be aware of their
hall council representatives' actions and par-
take in discussions to make their voices heard
so wiser decisions are made in the future.-
The North Quadrangle Committee for Inter-
national Impact should act responsibly and
reallocate the money for a more fruitful cause.
There are better activities that will fit the mis-
sion of the committee and allow more North
Quad residents to participate.

As society enters the Infor-
mation Age, more can be
questioned and researched.
Everything is on
the table, even
deeply held per-
sonal beliefs
like religion. .
A recent study
by the Univer-
sity of Arizona
and Northwest-
ern University DAR-WEI
suggests that CHEN
religion, and
Christianity in
particular, "will be driven toward
extinction" in nine countries in the
near future. This trend, while dis-
turbing to people of faith, makes
sense as Internet access becomes
more widespread across the world.
Contact with people of other
faiths can cause people to question
whether they picked the right one:
How do you know you have picked
the right deity to believe in? Liter-
ally millions of gods have existed
over the course of mankind, mak-
ing the chance somewhat slim that
yours is the real one.
The trend also makes sense
because scientific progress can
refute many of the basic tenets in
holy texts. For example, scientists
now know that the Earth is billions
of years old, not several thousand
as implied in the Bible. The sto-
ries about Jonah and the Whale,
as well as Noah's Ark, can also be
safely assumed to be fictional, due
to knowledge of digestive acids and
fossil records, respectively (if you
think the Bible is allegorical, those
are your words, not God's). The new
religions are equally as wacky: Sci-
entologists believe that Xenu, dic-
tator of the Galactic Confederacy,
brought billions of people to Earth
and blew them up with hydrogen

bombs in volcanoes, whose souls
are stuck to the bodies of the living
today. How they decided this story
was more believable than Noah's
Ark is beyond me. But if you say I
cannot prove God doesn't exist, I say
you can't prove Xenu doesn't exist.
Many of my friends, even reli-
gious ones, would admit that their
holy texts have stories that cannot
be taken seriously. They even admit
many of the laws in those books are
draconian (by the way, how can
a deity be omnipotent if he can't
make rules that stand the test of
time?). However, they usually argue
that religion has produced a net
positive effect for the world. Even if
their chosen faith is not believable
and their deity's rules are blatantly
immoral, the spirit of their religion
is a good one, they say. It's amazing
how many people admit to think-
ing this, somehow implying that
they don't believe in their religion
and subscribe to it like they are
supposed to. Some non-believers
defend religion in this way, suggest-
ing that it is beneficial to mankind.
I take issue with the statement
that religion has been good for the
world. Believerssaythatfaith-based
groups perform charitable work to
help those in need and give hope
to those in pain. I do not discount
that - people have indeed been
lifted up through faith. However,
those good deeds come at a price:
keeping the "religion excuse" alive.
Historically, religion has caused
much violence - the Crusades
and theInquisition to name two.
Nowadays, religion causes Middle
East violence, the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, subjugation of homosexu-
als, abortion clinic bombings and
countless other ghastly events. of
course, many believers will say
their religious beliefs do not imply
the endorsement of those violent

activities. True. But as long as faith
is used as the vehicle for these good
deeds, and religion permeates as
a result, others will always have
the "religion excuse" to do terrible
things. Physicist Steven Weinberg
once said that in a regular society,
you will have "good people doing
good things and evil people doing
evil things ... for good people to do
evil things, that takes religion."
How likely is it
that your God is
the right one?
Mankind has already proven
that it can do secularly all the good
things that faith groups do, but
without the aforementioned com-
plications. If we can eradicate reli-
gion and do charitable works from
the goodness of our hearts, and not
because of a higher power, we not
only show true compassion, but we
also eliminate a few of the good
people doing evil things that Wein-
berg talked about.
Religion does not make much
sense anymore in the 21st century.
The Internet and science are expos-
ing many religious beliefs that have
been accepted for a long time. Fur-
thermore, secularism is showing
it's more than capable of providing
charity and hope to those.in. need
-, and without religiousbaggage.
The only thing secularism can't do
is provide a deity to save you ... but
how likely is it that your deity is the
right one anyway?

Make first se-mester pass/fail

I hate the Every Three Weekly. I hate that
it's funnier than me. I hate that, unlike other
prestigious newspapers, students actually
read it. I hate that it'll probably ridicule me
for this introduction that seems oddly remi-
niscent of that one Julia Stiles movie that's not
about dancing and crying. And I really hate
that roughly every21 days, I can find my room-
mate collapsed in a bean bag, gushing about
how great it is that we have "real publications"
like the E3W on campus. And Pizza Rolls. Sigh.
But as Socrates once told Euthyphro, every
once in a while you have to give props to those
who get it right, even if they destroy your self-
esteem with consistently better humor writ-
ing. So here it is: E3W - kudos for the Karlos
Marks campaign. You did the damn thing.
The idea, in case you somehow missed the
Michigan Student Assembly elections - I
don't know, maybe you were too busy doing
work, having a social life, perhaps sorting your
button collection or anything really - the con-
cept was simple. Satire magazine on campus
began campaigns for Karlos Marks. Marks got
second in the presidential election - earning
more votes than the Defend Affirmative Action
Party's candidates - won representative seats
in MSA and earned a spot on the Department
of Public Safety Oversight Committee.
Marks, however, won't be taking these seats
next fall. Why not? As MSA members point-
ed out, made-up people cannot hold a public
office. Bravo.
What people are really upset about - wait,
is anyone actuallyupset? Huh. Well, what peo-
ple should be concerned about - ok, ok, what
people should kind of pay attention to is the
fact that a fake person beat out real, live candi-
dates: And rightfully so - it looks like MSA is
calling for another crusade against imaginary
people. Both me and my pal Norton are wor-
ried; who are actuarial math majors going to
talk to now? But my editor wants a sophisti-
cated analysis of student apathy and the lack
of faith in this school's governing bodies, and
apparently a narrative with my imaginary
duck is not the best way to make the point.

Sorry, Norton.
Anyways, onto the whole doubting MSA
thing. As it turns out, humor magazines on
this campus can do more than make poop
jokes relevant for 20-somethings. Regard-
less of their intentions, staff members of the
Every Three Weekly made student elections
more relevant than they've ever been - which
is to say, almost not entirely pointless. Even if
Karlos Marks was nothing more than a hom-
age to Carlos Mencia by means of a Santa Claus
look-a-like, Marks's popularity made it clear:
Beards are in again. Holla. And also students
don't trust MSA.
Perhaps distrust isn't exactly the right word
- after all, why would anyone distrust an
organization that takes in more than $500,000
of students' money and then spends meetings
passing resolutions on funding for new judi-
cial robes? Which I totally understand, by the
way - I was also disappointed when college
wasn't just like Hogwarts. No, no - frankly,
students just don't give a damn about MSA.
Despite the overwhelming popularity of fun
events like last November's Flu Day, MSA just
can't seem to connect with students. Which is
why every year, candidates have to try to get
people to care that their campaigns are all
about getting people to care. And, of course,
getting Nimbus 2000s.
Maybe MSA should take Marks's win as a
sign. A sign that next semester, maybe they
really should try to connect with more than
just the Quidditch Team. And though I'm pret-
ty indifferent about it, Norton seems to think
students should stop being so apathetic. Yes,
it's painful to log on to the website and vote
- you might not be the first one to re-blog the
latest picture of Paula Deen riding Snooki on
Tumblr - but you are paying MSA more than
seven bucks a semester. Might as well try to get
something out of them.
Anyways, I think I'll end this here - gotta
go burn every copy of E3W on campus. I'm
funny too, dammit.
Melanie Kruvelis is an LSA freshman.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology does it. So
does John Hopkins University. And Brown University.
Maybe we should think about it too. What exactly is it
that these schools do, you ask? They allow first semester
grades to be pass/fail for freshmen, providing a blessed
grade buffer during that stressful time when students
are first adjusting to college life. I'd like to think that in
terms of rigorous course load and caliber of students, the
University of Michigan is no less than the big names on
the East Coast. And perhaps we should consider taking a
leaf out of their books.
Having almost completed my first year and looking
back on the first semester, I can conclude that along with
being a completely new and exciting experience, fresh-
manyear was the biggest blur of my life. Between adjust-
ing to living away from home, keeping up with class
work, meeting dozens of new people and, on top of it
all, maintaining a pretty respectable GPA, there was no
time for anything else. Needless to say, freshman year is
a challenge - with so much to keep track of, it's difficult
to juggle everything without losing your mind.
Taking into account the stress of adjusting to college,
some of the nation's top universities have installed a
grade buffer for incoming freshmen. At these universi-
tiesthe firstsemester for freshmanyearlis pass/fail. This
is something the administration here should seriously
consider. There are regular concerns about the mental
health of college students, especially when they are first
adapting to college life. And let me tell you, the looming
pressure of writing an A grade English 125 paper, while
simultaneously not failing the upcoming orgo, calc and
econ exams, doesn't do much for mental health.
Coming into college, what I found most shocking was
how much grading differed across classes. It isn't just
about managing time skillfully enough to do all the work
(and do it well), but there is also the added burden of
calculating exactly what counts and how much it counts
for. It very quickly becomes a game of figuring out what
percentage of points is necessary to get by, and what is
the easiest way to achieve that.

Not only that, but each professor and GSI has a differ-
ent lecturing and teaching style. It's one thing to have
to adjust to a new schedule and course load, but to also
have to decipher the teaching and grading styles of each
instructor is an added burden. It often takes new stu-
dents a good three to four weeks of classes to get a grasp
of what is demanded and how they will be evaluated.
And, in a 15-week class, there isn't always much time to
catch up.
Not fretting about safeguarding a delicate GPA frees
up time and brainpower for first-year students to delve
into classes. As a freshman, when you're taking classes
to explore potential career paths or reaffirm current
ones, it makes sense to do just that - explore. But, when
you're stressing about getting a 90 percent on the next
exam, there isn't much time or energyleft for exploring.
There are people who will say a pass/fail policy will
just give incoming freshmen an excuse to not take
school seriously. But, the students who genuinely care
about the class will still care. By not being bogged down
by the pressure to get good grades, they will have more
opportunities to creatively explore the subject. They'll
be less worried about making mistakes or getting
penalized for having the wrong answer, which means
students will be more likely to take risks in terms of
how they approach a topic. They'll be inclined to begin
thinking about the topic and field of study itself, as
opposed to the end grade.
Sure, there's a difference in the quality of work
demanded at the college level, and freshman year is
expected to be tough. But we've all heard the disaster
stories from freshman year - the classes that we never
imagined would be so tough, the professors whose lec-
tures were more a cryptic code than lessons and the 0
papers that just didn't get written coherently at 3 a.m.
I'm not saying this should be a free-for-all. I'm saying
we all would have wanted a little bit of a break. Just for
one semester.

* After dismal 2010 for secondary,
Mattison excited with progress

Kim impresses
fans in Masters
practice round

By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
If injuries to Troy Woolfolk
and J.T. Floyd last season were a
blessing in disguise, then it sure
was an ugly one.
Without its No.1 corner for the
entire season and its No. 2 for the
last half, the Michigan defense
allowed 262 yards per game
through the air, which topped the
Wolverines' own super-powered
offensive pace.
Woolfolk and Floyd haven't
completely recovered from their
respective ankle injuries, but new
defensive coordinator Greg Mat-
tison sees the experience the unit
gained - allowing 35 points per
game - as the means to create a
good-looking secondary this fall.
"It's difficult if we're playing
a game today," Mattison said of
missing his two starting corner-
backs this spring. "But I tend to
look at that as a positive, in a way,
if those guys are players, which
they have shown that they are
at times, you get a chance to get
some depth.
"And you get a chance to bring
these other guys along. And you
get a chance for those guys to
prove that they could be guys that
can help you."
At cornerback, Courtney Avery,
Cullen Christian and Terrence
Talbott were all thrown into the
fire as freshmen - especially
Avery, who started five games in
2010. During practice on March
29, Avery and fifth-year senior
Tony Anderson worked with the
first team defense in the first por-
tion of practice, while Floyd was
also seen running on the side-
lines.
Those getting reps this spring
will most likely be bumped by the
fifth-year senior Woolfolk and
redshirt junior Floyd when they
return.
Playing "time at the safety posi
tion- will be just as difficult to
come by, but not because of inju-
ries - the position just has solid
depth.
"I've been pleased for the most
part with that group, and maybe
because there's carryover there,
as far as what they're playing,"
Mattison said of the secondary. "I
think Carvin (Johnson) has had
some really good days for us. I
think he's a guy that's done well.
Thomas Gordon has done a good
job.

Defensive Coordinator Greg Mattison will be charged with turning around a defense that allowed 35 points and more than
262 passing yards per game last season.

"And I hate to name guys,
because you're leaving somebody
out. But that position has done a
pretty good job."
With a logjam at the posi-
tion - brought on by the switch
of players who were playing in
Rich Rodriguez's hybrid-line-
backer position to safety - cur-
rent Michigan coach Brady Hoke
said earlier this spring that safety
would be a deep position, perfect
for the competitive environment
he's promoting.
There's the veteran redshirt
junior, Jordan Kovacs, as well as
a talented group of youngsters
who Mattison said he was excited
about, including Thomas Gordon,
Johnson and Marvin Robinson.
As a group, there are two
problems that Mattison is focus-
ing on curtailing as he molds his
defensive players: limit the big
plays and get off the field on third
down. The two are products of
each other - fatigue sets in the
longer the defense plays, which
helped Wisconsin and Michigan
State pound Michigan in the sec-
ond halves of those 2010 losses.
"It isn't how much of a rest you
get, it's the kind of defense you
play to give yourself the amount
of rest," Mattison said. "And that's
why, for us, third-down defense is
critical ... Because if you don't get
off the field on third down then

it's six plays. And if you don't get
off the field again, now you're at
nine plays. And that'son you. Your
job is (to) do what you're supposed
to do to get off the field."
In 2010, the Wolverines' oppo-
nents converted at a 43-percent
success rate on third downs -
that number climbed to more
than 51 percent in Michigan's six
losses and dipped as low as 36
percent in its seven wins.
Mattison said a big factor in his
plan for third down will be the
nickel package - the Wolverines
will add an extra defensive back
and take the strongside lineback-
er, currently Cam Gordon, off the
field.
"To be really good on third
down, you've got to be able to
have the best players on the field
that can cover people and blitz
and all of that," Mattison said. '
One player who could be in the
mix at both safety and nickel cor-
nerback is Thomas Gordon. He's
worked at both spots this spring,
and has practiced at both safety
positions - but Mattison said he
expected all of the safeties to be
able to playboth safety positions.
Johnson has "stood out and
made some plays," too, accord-
ing to Mattison. He broke onto
the scene when he started as a
true freshman last season as the
hybrid linebacker. But he was

injured in the first half in the sea-
son opener against Connecticut,
and spent the rest of the year as a
part-time starter.
And Robinson, who has missed
one spring practice per week due
to a conflict with class, drew Cam
Gordon-esque praise from Matti-
son last week.
"He's got the range and he's
got the ability to run and he hits,"
Mattison said of the sophomore.
"So now, it's going to be a matter
of getting him (in) the defenses
that we need and make sure he
knows what's going on. I was
really excited about him - good-
looking athlete that plays hard
and will hit you - I like those
kind of guys."
The depth seems to be building
itself through competition this
spring for the Wolverines.
As for preventing those big
plays?
Mattison is working on it.
"They've just picked up the
scheme," Mattison said. "When
I say I'm happy with them - I'm
never happy when a big play
occurs, and we've had some big
plays and they know that and we
can't allow that.
"I am happy with them, in that
they've picked up what we want
to try to do. Now they have to
execute to do it better, with more
consistency."

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
AUGUSTA, Ga. - As Michi-
gan golfer Lion Kim walked up
to the 16th tee during Monday's
practice round at the Masters,
the senior heard a familiar shout
from the crowd.
"I'm
always proud KEVIN
to be a Michi- RAFTERY
gan student,"
Kim said.
"But espe- At the Masters
cially today,
I probably heard people say
'Go Blue!' a thousand times. It
just shows you how everybody
knows the block 'M' and what it
stands for. It's very cool."
Just as he did throughout his
entire round on a blistery but
warm Monday in Augusta, Kim
looked up into the 16th-hole
grandstands and gave his fans a
smile and a thumbs up. He even
stopped to take a quick picture
with a few fans standing near
the tee box.
And just moments later, Kim
gave everybody a reason to
shout. After hitting his tee shot
on the par-3, 170-yard 16th to
about 10 feet from the hole, he
paused and looked into his bag.
"I grabbed a four iron, but
(caddie Louis Lawrence) goes,
'You should take a five or a six,'
" Kim said. "So I was like, 'I'll go
with a five.' "
It seemed like an odd choice
for someone who was on his way
to the green. But after walking
about 20 yards, Kim stopped
short of the pond that extends
about 120 yards out from the
green.
He threw down a new ball
just short of the pond, aid thex
crowd exploded with cheers '
they knew what he was about to
do.
"It's a Masters tradition," Kim
said. "Every time in a practice
round (at number 16), they want
you to hit a shot where it skips
over the pond and tryto see how
close you can get to the hole."
Kim took a short backswing
as if he was chipping, and the
ball jumped offhis club and onto
the pond, making the surface
look more like ice than water. It
skipped several times and had
just enough gas to make it over
the pond.
The ball hopped onto the

green and settled about 15 feet
from the pin - Kim smiled,
took off his Michigan visor and
bowed to the crowd.
"Ihad never done that before,"
Kim said. "I just basically told
(Laurence), 'I don't want to
embarrass myself and just leave
it in the water' But it turned out
to be a really good shot."
It was a special day for Kim
and the Michigan community as
a whole, as Michigan polos and
hats could be found around the
course.
Kim started the day on the
front nine with 2007 Masters
champion and friend Zach John-
son. As he walked up to the first
tee, thousands of people lined
the fairways.
"It was amazing," Kim said.
"It was my first time playing in
front of a crowd. But to tell you
the truth, I wasn't nervous at all.
And that's partially because I
was with my good buddy (John-
son)."
Kim said Johnson helped him
get to know the ins and outs of
the course, but that he talked
to him about other stuff, too.
The two shared several laughs
throughout the round.
"We can joke around and have
fun," Kim said. "That's what's
exciting. For the first couple
practice rounds, you're not too
serious. You're just getting used
to the course and to the layout.
"I was very pleased that a guy
of his caliber still keeps up with
a friend like me, and just tries to
check up on me."
After Kim and Johnson fin-
ished the front nine around 1
p.m., the two shook hands and
parted ways. Kim took a lunch
break and returned to the back
nine'at4:15. -I
He had to end the round early
in order to make it to the tradi-
tional Amateur Dinner on the
night after the first practice
round. But as he made his way
off the 16th green and into a cart
that took him to the clubhouse,
he made sure he saved time to
talk to a few more fans.
"That's what's special about
practice rounds," Kim said. "A
lot of kids come in and they just
want autographs. It doesn't mat-
ter if you're Tiger Woods or just
an amateur - they want auto-
graphs. And that's what's fun
and unique about this tourna-
ment."

Caddy calming influence for Kim

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
AUGUSTA, Ga. - After win-
ning the US Amateur Public
Links Tournament in July, his
ticket was punched and his
dream was about to become real-
ity - but Michigan golfer Lion
Kim was still
missing an KEVIN
essential com- RAFTERY
ponent that
every success-
ful golfer must At the Masters
have.
He was
missing the Robin to his Bat-
man, the Shaggy to his Scooby
Doo, the Tails to his Sonic - Kim
needed a caddy.
So in early February, when
Kim traveled to Augusta for
practice, he went searching for
one. He tried out four different
caddies, hoping to find the per-
fect fit for his game.
Each caddy went out with
him on the course, exchang-
ing conversations with Kim and
encouraging him as he navigated
his way through the pristine fair-
ways of Augusta National.
And by the end of the trip,
Kim had found his caddy - Louis
Laurence, a 62-year-old former
pro who has caddied at Augusta
since 1988.
"His knowledge of the golf
V course and just the way he
approaches shots is what set him
apart," Kim said. "He keeps it
pretty simple. He just says the
right things at the right time. He
keeps me loose and gives me con-
fidence."

Laurence praised Kim's game
several times, saying he's got "all

"He's got a wonderful short

tion that people are not ready

Though he met Kim less than
two months ago, Laurence has
worked hard to make sure he
knows Kim's game as best he can.

Berenson unsure if recovering Burlon will play in Frozen Four


By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Editor
Brandon Burlon isn't the type
of guy who needs to watch his
weight, but he's on the baby-food
diet anyway.
And though he's developed
new eating habits, they haven't
changed by choice.
After the junior defenseman
helped the Michigan hockey
team dispose of Bowling Green
'in the second round of the CCHA
Tournament, he received penicil-
lin for what was believed to be
strep throat. The throat swelling
didn't stop, forcing Burlon to visit
the hospital a couple times the
next week. While there, doctors
reevaluated his situation.
The final diagnosis was esoph-
agitis, an inflammation of the lin-

ing of the esophagus. Its biggest
symptom? Difficulty swallowing.
"The last count was nine days
that I didn't take food in," Burlon
said. "It was just a lot of water a
little bit at a time, some shakes
here and there if I could muster
them down. I started off eating
apple sauce and pureed soup,
mixing it with water. I graduated
to yogurt, but I was eating baby
food at one point just to get some
nutrients in me."
Burlon missed the CCHA semi-
finals in Detroit, the consolation
game and both of the Wolverines'
wins in the West Regional of the
NCAA Tournament in St. Louis.
He didn't make either trip.
And though losing weight
wasn'this goal, the baby-food diet
worked - Burlon lost 17 pounds.
Now, three days away from

playing No. 1 North Dakota in the
Frozen Four, Burlon is back - at
least in practice. He skated in
practice all last week and is slow-
ly gaining back the weight he lost.
But Michigan coach Red Beren-
son was not committed at the
beginning of last weel on allow-
ing Burlon to play, saying "we'll
see how he comes. along." On
Monday, the tune wasn't any dif-
ferent. After practice, Berenson
said he was still unsure whether
Burlon would play or not.
"Typically, you'd rather play a
junior than a freshman ina situa-
tion like this if he's a good player,"
Berenson said. "So we have to
make sure he's up to snuff before
we decide whether he's going to
play or not."
The New Jersey Devils draft
pick has five goals and 13 assists

this season to go along with a plus
14 rating. He was paired with
sophomore Lee Moffie before his
injury, but practiced with junior
Greg Pateryn last week. Wher-
ever he plays, he provides veteran
leadership on a defensive unit
that has three freshmen and just
one senior.
With the big and fast North
Dakota forecheck likely to cause
havoc on the young Michigan
defensemen in the Wolverine
zone all game, Michigan will
need Burlon's ability to get the
puck out withboth his crisp pass-
es and his feet.
"He's played in these games -
not (the) Frozen Four - but he
went through this last year and
the year before, playing in tour-
nament games," Berenson said.
"He can add offense and give us

Music for Japan
binds sound and
selflessness
ByJULIA SMITH-EPPSTEINER
Daily Arts Writer
Music has been proven to alter
brain waves and heart rate, affect
plant growth, mend a broken
heart and - most importantly -
to raise money for charity. This
time around, Japan is in need, and
iTunes, the Morning Benders and
Sava's Cafe have stepped up to the
plate with fervor.
It's true that we very rarely
have the sound satisfaction of
seeing our cash directly translate
into a concrete place of assistance,
thus doubts can arise. We may
have doubts about our money
providing tangible relief, but it
is such a devastating occurrence
that even the possibility makes it
worth it.
Mainstream music's biggest
names have responded to the
devastaljqn frpm the 8.9-mag-
nitude earthquake near the east
coast of Honshu, Japan and the
ensuing Pacific tsunami with
Songs for Japan. The album con-
tains 38 previously recorded
popular songs for $9.99 (found
on iTunes's homepage), and all
proceeds go straight to the Japa-
nese Red Cross Society to be used
for immediate relief and eventual
recovery support.
Songs for Japan features 30
altruistic artists including U2,
Norah Jones, Kings of Leon,
Rihanna, Black Eyed Peas, Adele,
Bob Dylan, Justin Bieber, Emi-

nem and Bruce Springsteen.
It seems that a lot of the songs
on the compilation, like "Imag-
ine" by John Lennon and "Hold
On" by Michael Bubl, were cho-
sen for their lyrically inspiration-
al tone. However, there are some
that don't fit the philanthropic
shoe.
For instance, it escapes me as
to how Rihanna's "Only Girl (In
The World)" suits the album's
purpose, with lyrics like, "Take
me for a ride, ride / Oh baby, take
me high, high / Let me take you
by surprise / Oh make it last all
night, night." Does she want the
disaster to last all night long?
Can't be that ... the connection to
Japan is lost on me.
But in reality, if "Only Girl"
and other irrelevant songs on the
album boost the number of pur-
chasers - contributing to relief
down the line - then I'm not
opposed.
There is one album that I
admittedly like better and is
also assisting Japan through the
power of music: Japan Echo. The
Morning Bendersy e-somewhat
small-time band. from Berkeley,
Calif., came out with their sev-
enth EP a week after the disaster
took place. One hundred percent
of their proceeds are being donat-
ed to Japan Society's Earthquake
Relief Fund.
Japan Echo has eight tracks
full of remixed indie-pop rapture.
One can purchase this album
for incremental prices spanning
in generosity from five to one
hundred dollars, with all levels
of donation appreciated by the
Morning Benders.
This humanitarian EP feels

much more connected to the
Japan tragedy than Songs for
Japan, as band member Chris
Chu was born in Japan and has
"always had a deep love for the
country and people," according
to a statement he made on the
album's release. Even further
attaching the Morning Benders
to the island nation is the fact that
they were scheduled to play their
first Tokyo show when the disas-
ter hit.
Japan Echo gets superbly
funky with "Excuses" (RAC
Remix), "Hand Me Downs"
(Wild Nothing Remix) and "Bet-
ter In Blue." These eight tracks
aren't just a rehashing of old
songs but will bring a pleasing
electronic soundscape for do-
gooders to dance to.
More locally, on Ann Arbor's
beloved South State Street, Sava's
Cafe held "Jam for Japan" last
Wednesday. There was a live
performance by Derby Mama,
Future Genies, Leap Year and
Buttonsphere, and even the col-
lege students at the event dished
out their treasured pocket money.
. Sava's raised oezbii'0 as of 12
a.m. on Thursday, when they still
had two more hours of benevolent
partying to go.
Even if I prefer listening to
Japan Echo or local bands over
sweet potato fries, I'm beginning
to realize that allofthese attempts
are hitting different demograph-
ics (in some cases Bieber Fever
hooligans) and have serious value.
If you have contributed to better-
ing the lives of the Japanese survi-
vors in this way already, continue
to enjoythe tunes. If not, jump on
it and get jammin' for Japan.

Dr. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany,
"Desperate Housewives"), is a
hastily thrown-together mess,
frequently sputtering dialogue
0 so painfully tired and overused it
will make your ears bleed.
Hunt can't seem to make up
her mind on which stereotypi-
cal character from a medical or
criminal procedural drama she
wants to embody. She's a char-
* acter from a different show in
every scene - from a snarky
doctor with an inferiority com-
plex (a la "House"), to a socially
incompetent brainiac ("Bones"),
to a tough cop out for justice
("Law & Order: Special Victims
Unit"), to a woman dealing with
a repressed love for her partner
("Castle"). Yet all these hopeless-
ly hackneyed possibilities don't
save Hunt from acting like she's
walking around with a question
mark over her head.
You know a show is bad when
even a seasoned actress like
Delany can't quite pull off such
a mundane character. There are
moments where it seems that
she might just break through
the achingly awful dialogue
and overly trite plot, but every
attempt falls short of satisfactory.

in activating the e-mail," Brown
said.
The emergency alert sent out
via text and phone messages at
about 1 a.m. Monday stated that
a man with a gun was reported
to have been in the Chemistry
Building at midnight. The alert
urged people to stay away from
the building and for people in the
building to take shelter. At 1:25
a.m., another emergency alert
via text and voice recording gave
an "all clear" and stated that "no
problems were found."
However, neither of the emer-
gency alerts were sent via e-mail
- they were only sent via text
and phone messages.
Brown said emergency alerts
are intended to inform people to
"take immediate action for their
safety," while crime alerts are for
less urgent messages.
Brown also said some concern
has been raised about the appar-
ent delay in issuingthe emergen-
cy alert text messages and phone
calls. DPS officers were aware of
the situation at around midnight,
but the emergency alerts weren't
sent until 1 a.m.
"We do the best we can as the
events unfold with the informa-

tion that we have and the system
available to us," Brown said. "We
didn't have solid enough infor-
mation at midnight to warrant
activating the emergency alert."
The witness wasn't entirely
sure the gun was real, Brown
said, adding that the witness
originally described it as a BB
gun.
After the employee reported
the incident, Brown said DPS
sent all available officers to the
Chemistry Building and notified
the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment, which also sent officers to
the scene to surround the build-
ing. DPS officers then swept
the building to search for the
trespasser and to tell students
and employees who were in the
building to either hide or leave,
depending on their proximity to
doorways, accordingto Brown.
Though officers were sta-
tioned at the building's door-
ways, the suspect had likely
exited the building prior to the
officers' arrival, Brown said. She
added that there were a few min-
utes of delay between the sight-
ing of the suspect and the call to
DPS.
Coleman said she is satisfied
with the way DPS handled the
situation, but said the University
must continue to keep campus
safety a top priority.

"On the one hand, I was happy
about the way that it worked,"
Coleman said. "On the other, of
course I'm always concerned
if there's something that looks
amiss. We are always trying to
balance access to spaces people
need to do their work with safe-
ty."
Since the incident, DPS has
re-interviewed the witness and
gathered information to share
the suspect's description with
the campus community.
The crime alert describes the
suspect as being a college-aged
white male with brown hair
and a "thin to medium build."
The witness also told DPS he
was wearing a dark-colored hat
and sweatshirt, according to the
crime alert.
DPS tests the emergency
e-mail alert system at least once
each semester to ensure low risk
of a system failure, Brown said.
She added that DPS has other
"drills" that are performed at
least once each year to practice
activating the emergency alert
system.
"(The systems) are somewhat
complicated," Brown said. "It's
not a one-to-one text message
system. We're delivering mes-
sages to thousands and thou-
sands of people so we continue
to rehearse these protocols."

as what they consider to be King's
legacy, the relationship between
King and Malcolm X and current
and past concerns about war and
racism.
One of the panelists, Robin
Kelley, a professor of American
studies and ethnicity and his-
tory at the University of Southern
California, said there is historical
evidence that activism works. He
said it may be difficult to see the

end of the cycle of change, but
change is possible, and people
have to keep working toward it.
"The fact that we have his-
torical evidence of change means
that sometimes you may not see
the end of the cycle, but you are
definitely making ithappen," Kel-
ley said.
Discussing "sustainable activ-
ism" - how to be an activist today
and in the future - the panel
members encouraged the event
attendees to take action, even
when it is difficult.
"Start with something small,
start with something local, don't
try to change the world," Boggs
said during the forum.
Boggs added that it was,-up to
students and other activists to
make the changes they desire in
the world.
"We have to look into ourselves
and understand the time has
come...to grow our souls," Boggs
said. "Every crisis is not only a
failure but an opportunity."
Students who attended the
forum were inspired by the words
of the panelists, particularly
Boggs.

LSA junior Sara Schreiber-
Rose said she was familiar with
Boggs before she came to the
event and is inspired by the work
Boggs has done.
"She has this great power,"
Schreiber-Rose said. "That's
really inspirational where you
see someone who has dedicated
her entire lifeto making everyone
else's lives better."
LSA senior Gabrielle Butter-
field said she had never been to an
event so focused on social justice
and activism.
"Grace Lee Boggs talked a lot
about racism, militarization and
materialism, which are things
that I learn about in my classes,
but I don't know how it translates
into the real world," Butterfield
said. "It's honestly kind of reas-
suring to know that other people
care about those issues."
LSA junior Sierra Eschrich,
who attended the event for a class,
said she also found the event rel-
evant to her coursework.
"I really like how my studies of
history and political science were
kind of tweaked by their take on
(these issues)," Eschrich said.
