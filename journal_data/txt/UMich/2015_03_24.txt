CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Party provides 

music, food before 
polls open on Wed.
for CSG elections

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Two days before the polls 

are set to open for Central Stu-
dent Government elections, The 
Team bared the cold Monday 
evening to spread the word about 
their platform goals and rally 
voters. The Team will run LSA 

junior Will Royster as the party’s 
presidential candidate and LSA 
sophomore Matt Fidel for vice 
president.

Campaign supporters handed 

out flyers and offered cookies, 
Domino’s pizza and Tim Hor-
ton’s coffee and hot chocolate to 
passersby in the Diag.

“We’re showing campus a 

good time,” Fidel said. “Every-
body’s walking through the Diag, 
it’s free to join in, just kind of see 
what The Team’s all about.”

Aside from a DJ’s table in front 

of the Hatcher Graduate Library, 
the Black Student Union, the 
Cool Club — a University cloth-

ing startup — and University 
fashion groups NOiR and Bronze 
Elegance also set up tables to 
promote their respective organi-
zations.

“This is a great platform for 

us to get our message out, but 
to also support other student 
organizations, and that’s what we 
want to be here for,” Royster said. 
“We asked other organizations 
to be a part of this so that they 
can get their message out as well. 
That’s a big part of our platform 
and it’s successful.”

Royster said having the orga-

nizations there showed that 
even though The Team has yet 

to be elected, the party still cares 
about advancing their platform 
on campus.

“Authenticity: that’s been our 

campaign 
strategy,” 
Royster 

said. “Just at this rally we talked 
about creating a platform and 
empowering people, but we’re 
not waiting until we get elected; 
we’re doing that now, and that’s 
something that we have a track 
record of.”

Music played throughout the 

rally, and campaign members 
and students danced between 
speeches and discussions about 
The Team’s policies. The rally 

Uncontested exec. 
candidates focus on 
diversity, student 

engagement

Though 
chalk 
messages 

touting Make Michigan, The 
Team and the Defend Affirma-
tive Action Party began cover-
ing campus in advance of this 
week’s Central Student Govern-
ment election, students pitched 
platforms Monday night for 
another race — LSA Student 
Government elections.

At the event, several LSA Stu-

dent Government candidates 
presented their platforms and 
answered questions during a 
candidate forum in the Michi-
gan Union.

The presenters included LSA 

juniors Jason Colella and Reid 
Klootwyk Colella, the uncon-
tested candidates for LSA SG 

president and vice president, 
respectively.

Colella and Kloowyk’s plat-

form calls for improving cam-
pus climate and increasing 
diversity. The goal reflects that 
of the University leadership. In 
February, University President 
Mark Schlissel held a leader-
ship breakfast to consider issues 
related to diversity on campus, 
including diversity of the stu-
dent body and faculty, inclusion 
and the creation of a strategic 
diversity plan.

Klootwyk, who serves as 

vice chair of the LSA SG com-
munications committee, said 
addressing 
issues 
regarding 

international and transfer stu-
dents is an important part of 
addressing diversity.

“Our international student 

mentorship program is a huge 
project 
we’re 
working 
on,” 

Klootwyk said. “I’m also work-
ing on a project that will allow 
transfer students to defer enroll-
ment as freshmen are able to.”

Eight new stations 

to open in May 
following last 
season’s success 

By LARA MOEHLMAN

With the snow mostly melted 

and the sidewalks visible again, 
the Ann Arbor bike share pro-
gram ArborBike is back.

On Friday, the nonprofit Clean 

Energy Coalition, in collabora-
tion with the University, the city 
of Ann Arbor and the Ann Arbor 
Area Transportation Author-
ity, reopened ArborBike for the 
season. The service, which is 
a bike share program serving 
both students and residents, first 
launched in the fall.

ArborBike consists of a set 

of stations around the city and 
campus that have bikes available 
for temporary use. At the end of 
an hour, users return the bikes to 
one of the ArborBike stations.

The program has five kiosks 

on campus and another at the 
Ann Arbor Public Library’s 
downtown branch. Eight more 
stations will be added by late 
May to expand the program off 
campus.

The fall 2014 season ended 

with 293 users and 690 trips over 
the two-month period before 
biking season ended. According 
to an ArborBike press release, 
ArborBike expects membership 
to increase dramatically this 
round due to both an extended 
summer 2015 season and an 

Interdisciplinary 
training initiative 
to explore human 
health and disease

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

Beginning next fall, the Uni-

versity will launch an multidisci-
plinary science-training program.

The program, called Integrated 

in Microbial Systems: Modeling, 
Population 
and 
Experimental 

Approaches, will combine popu-
lation and microbiome sciences 
to explore human health and dis-
eases. A microbiome is defined as 
the microorganisms in a particular 
environment.

Betsy Foxman, program co-

director and professor of epide-
miology at the School of Public 
Health, said the goal of the pro-
gram is to train scientists who are 
able to apply laboratory and popu-
lation approaches to the study of 
microbial communities in human 
health.

“Our long term research goal 

is to learn how to sustain healthy 
microbial communities and to 
manipulate unhealthy ones so as to 
improve human health,” Foxman 
said.

Tom Schmidt, the program’s 

other co-director and professor 
of Ecology and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy, said he hopes the program 
will lead to new discoveries about 
how the microbiome is related to 
diseases. He added that the pro-
gram’s work could extend beyond 

just human health and allow study 
of microbial communities in other 
organisms like animals and plants.

Schmidt said the program will 

be able to fund four doctoral stu-
dents per year. Other students will 
also be able to benefit from work-
shops and symposia hosted by the 
program.

“We are looking for people who 

reach across the traditional aca-
demic boundaries, people who are 
willing to gain expertise not only 
in microbiology, but also in model-
ing and ecology and dealing with 
large datasets that come with the 
study of the microbiome,” he said.

The program will be funded 

through the Burroughs Wellcome 
Fund Award, which will provide 
$2.5 million over a five- year peri-
od. The fund donates money to 
similar programs at universities 
across the country with the goal 
of integrating the fields medicine 
with public health. The University 
was one of the four grant recipients 
in 2014.

The 
other 
three 
were 

Dartmouth College, University 
of Rochester and Washington 
University in St. Louis.

Russ Campbell, communica-

tions officer for Burroughs Well-
come Fund, said the University’s 
program connects bench sciences 
and public health.

“Students who would have oth-

erwise taken a traditional labo-
ratory-based Ph.D. are thinking 
about problems through a pub-
lic health lens and students who 
would have otherwise trained in 
traditional public health approach-
es are exposed to the power of ask-
ing questions at the molecular or 

Funding proposals 

for fiscal years 
2016, 2017 slated 
for a vote in May

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

Ann Arbor City Council con-

vened for another discussion 
on the 2016 and 2017 fiscal year 
budgets Monday evening. The 
meeting focused on public ser-
vices, including street lighting, 
streets and facilities upgrades.

Craig Hupy, Ann Arbor’s 

public services administrator, 
presented the city staff’s pro-
posal for this section of the gen-
eral fund.

Following the lifting of a 

10-year moratorium on new 
streetlights last month, the 
Council heard plans for poten-
tial streetlight expenditures for 
the next two years.

Among the staff’s recommen-

dations is a $750,000 investment 
in Kerrytown street lighting in 
the 2017 fiscal year and an addi-
tional $3.25 million for other 
areas in and outside the down-
town area. Hupy said the Ker-
rytown investment includes 90 
street poles and will replace all 
current lights in the area.

While Hupy said Kerrytown 

lighting has been identified for 
attention, the city has not yet 
discussed the actual installa-
tion with Ann Arbor Down-
town Development Authority.

Councilmember 
Stephen 

Kunselman (D–Ward 3) spoke 
in favor of the Kerrytown 
investment.

“I would highly encourage 

that the DDA help fund sub-
stantially the Kerrytown proj-
ect,” he said.

The report states that each 

streetlight pole in the city will 
cost $43,013 over 40 years, 
which would include the costs 
of replacement parts, energy 
and labor.

Hupy the city will consid-

er requests for additional or 

upgraded street lighting and 
rank them against other gen-
eral fund priorities.

The Council also discussed 

several 
forthcoming 
street 

projects, including a proposal 
encouraging extensive street 
reconstruction and resurfacing 
projects.

The report proposes expendi-

tures amounting $7.1 million for 
annual street resurfacing and 
$3.7 million for major recon-
structions for both years, with 
another $7.4 million for street 
and right of way maintenance.

Several major and smaller 

local streets are up for resurfac-
ing in 2015, including the stretch 
of Packard Street between State 
Street and Stadium Boulevard 
and State Street from Eisen-
hower Parkway to I-94.

Councilmember Julie Grand 

(D–Ward 3) said undergoing 
multiple projects at the same 
time could be problematic.

City Engineer Nick Hutchin-

son said Ann Arbor plans to 
take precautions to let residents

sophomore 
Chris 

Hughes and LSA senior Bo Brad-
arich are co-presidents of Big 
Ticket Productions, the Universi-
ty’s concert production commit-
tee. The group brings big name 
artists to perform on campus. 
BTP brought Chance the Rapper 
and SchoolBoy Q to campus last 
year.

How did you join BTP?

Bradarich: “My sophomore 

year, I set up a meeting with 
Nick from CCI (the Center for 
Campus Involvement) and I 
asked him ‘What is the best way 
to get involved at Michigan?’ 
I told him that I wanted to get 
involved with something that 

would have a huge impact on 
campus, so he directed me to 
the UAC program, and through 
that I found Big Ticket Produc-
tions. I wanted to make a huge 
impact while I was here.

Hughes: “I knew coming into 

Michigan that I wanted to do 
something that involved music. 
When my brother graduated 
from college he was putting on 
concerts and I knew I wanted 
to do something similar. So 
when I was walking around 
Festifall my freshman year I got 
a flyer from Steven Rosenblum, 
who was the president last year, 
and I thought it would be awe-
some to join.”

What is your favorite part 

about BTP?

Hughes: “I would say my favor-

ite part of being involved with 
Big Ticket is being around other 
people who are just as passion-
ate about music as I am because 
for me it’s easier to connect with 
people who have the same music 
taste as me and I think it says a lot 
about a person, about what kind 
of music they listen to.”

Bradarich: “My favorite parts 

are the people and the environ-
ment. It’s a great group of people 
and it’s a great way to develop 
yourself and work as a team.

Study supports increase in 
legal cigarette buying age

Institute of Health 
finds raising min. age 
could cut adolescent 
tobacco purchase

By KATIE PENROD 

Daily Staff Reporter

According to a new study 

by the Institute of Medicine, 
raising the minimum legal age 
of access to tobacco products 
could prevent or delay tobacco 
use in adolescents.

The 
Federal 
Drug 

Administration commissioned 
the 
study, 
which 
included 

contributions 
from 
two 

University researchers: Rafael 
Meza, assistant professor of 
Epidemiology, 
and 
Patrick 

O’Malley, a research professor 
at the Institute for Social 
Research.

The study concluded that if 

the minimum age was raised 
nationally, underage adolescent 
tobacco use would decrease. 
It 
recommended 
that 
the 

minimum age be 21 years old, 
which would lead to a 12 percent 
reduction in tobacco prevalence 
by 2100.

“First of all, what we found 

is raising the minimum legal 
age for access would lead to 
significant 
health 
benefits,” 

Meza said.

Meza 
said 
the 
Family 

Smoking 
Prevention 
and 

Tobacco Control Act of 2009 
gave the FDA control over 
tobacco regulations, but did 
not 
grant 
it 
the 
authority 

to determine the minimum 
purchasing age for tobacco 
products.

Congress 
had 
previously 

ordered the FDA to provide a 
report regarding the health 
implications 
of 
raising 
the 

minimum age by April 2015.

As a result, Meza added, 

the responsibility to decide 
legal purchasing age is left 
to individual states — the 
majority of which have kept 
their minimum at 18 years old. 
If the FDA can prove significant 
health benefits will result from 
raising the age, Congress may 
become more open to giving the 
FDA authority in the matter.

The study shows that the age 

group most impacted by raising 
the minimum legal purchasing 
age would be adolescents aged 
15 to 17.

“The initiation age of tobacco 

use is critical. Among adults 
who become daily smokers, 
approximately 
90 
percent 

report first use of cigarettes 
before reaching 19 years of age, 
and almost 100 percent report 
first use before age 26,” the 
study says.

Meza explained that raising 

the minimum purchasing age 
would lower initiation rates for 
teenagers.

“If the age was raised that 

would limit their access,” Meza 
said. “So right now, any high 
schooler has access to a senior 
that is of the age. So if you raise 
it to 21, that will limit their 
social sources.”

The 
committee 
used 

statistical models for testing the 
effects of smoking to further 
expand upon the health risks 
associated with tobacco use.

First-year medical student 

Stephan 
Diljak 
said 
he 

recognizes the serious health 
consequences associated with 
tobacco use, and thinks raising 
the minimum legal age would 
have benefits.

“Personally, I believe in the 

data that less people could 
suffer from complications or 
potentially die if the age in 
which 
they 
are 
potentially 

allowed to purchase tobacco 
was raised,” he said.

Eitan Bar-Yosef, a Fellow at the Frankel Institute, outlines the similarities between Israeli culture and the book Heart of 
Darkness at Rackham Assembly Hall on Monday.
Researchers discuss Israel, 
colonialism at symposium

At second annual 

event, Judaic Studies 
fellows share their 
research findings 

By IAN DILLINGHAM 

Daily Staff Reporter

Members of the University’s 

Frankel Institute for Advanced 
Judaic 
Studies 
gathered 
in 

Rackham 
Graduate 
School 

Monday evening to talk about 
Jews, Arabs and colonialism.

The second annual Wieseneck 

Family Israel Symposium focused 
on the Jewish experience as part 
of a broader international context.

Institute fellows and visiting 

professors presented papers on 
topics such as food, film and 
literature. 
Common 
among 

these discussions was a focus on 
European influence in defining 
cultural 
identities 
among 

Jewish, Muslim and Christian 
communities in the Middle East.

The 
Frankel 
Institute 
for 

Advanced Judaic Studies is a 
University research unit that 

provides one-year grants for 
scholars to conduct research 
across a range of topics and 
disciplines. Each year, research 
conducted by the fellows centers 
on a specific theme. Fellows are 
required to give a lecture over the 
course of the year to help make 
research more available to the 
public.

The theme for the 2014-

2015 
fellowship 
was 
“Jews 

and Empires,” which looked to 
highlight the role of imperial 
powers in Jewish history — from 
the exodus from Egypt to the 
Holocaust and establishment of 
Israel.

Judaic 
Studies 
Prof. 

Mikhail 
Krutikov 
said 
this 

theme 
drew 
attention 
to 
a 

common 
misunderstanding 

that 
colonialism 
embodies 
a 

dichotomy — groups can be 
defined as either the colonizers or 
the colonized. At various points 
in history, he said, Jews have 
fallen into either one of these two 
groups. At other times, neither 
can accurately define them.

The 
event 
also 
promoted 

discussion 
across 
boundaries 

and 
time 
periods. 
Institute 

Director Deborah Dash Moore 
said a mission of the institute is 
to encourage fellows to discuss 
issues outside their primary area 
of study, which allows parallel 
narratives to be drawn across 
time and geography in cultural 
studies.

Examples 
of 
this 

multidisciplinary 
research 

were 
visible 
throughout 
the 

symposium.

Eitan Bar-Yosef, a fellow at 

the Frankel Institute, delivered 
a presentation highlighting the 
cultural evocation of elements 
from Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of

Resort shows strong 
outlook for tourism 

A new report says that Michi-

gan’s tourism industry grew in 
2014 despite the cold, wet year, 
and the tourism outlook is sunny 
going forward.

The Michigan State Univer-

sity report says that 2014 was 6 
percent cooler and 11 percent 
wetter than normal. Even so, it 
says hotel occupancy was up 2 
percent and car traffic increased 
1 percent.

Michigan State researchers 

released the report Monday at 
the Pure Michigan Governor’s 
Conference on Tourism in Grand 
Rapids.

The 
researchers 
say 
2015 

should be another year of growth 
for tourism in the state. The 
number of people traveling to 
and around the state is expected 
to increase 1.5 percent this year.

SCOTUS rejects 
voter ID challenge

The U.S. Supreme Court on 

Monday turned away a chal-
lenge to Wisconsin’s voter iden-
tification law, allowing the law 
to stand and handing a victory 
to Gov. Scott Walker following 
a long fight by opponents who 
say it’s a thinly veiled attempt to 
make it more difficult for Demo-
cratic backers to vote.

The law won’t be enforced for 

an April 7 election because it’s 
only two weeks away, but it will 
be in subsequent elections, the 
state attorney general said.

Walker, a likely 2016 Repub-

lican presidential candidate, is a 
longtime proponent of voter ID 
requirements and signed Wis-
consin’s into law in 2011. But it 
was only in effect for one low-
turnout primary in 2012 before 
legal challenges kept it on hold.

Bush family to 
attend fundraiser

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — 

Former President George W. Bush 
is scheduled to attend a Lone 
Star-studded fundraiser in Dal-
las Wednesday for his brother Jeb 
Bush.

The former president and for-

mer first lady Laura Bush are the 
special guests named to appear 
with the former Florida governor, 
who is expected to announce in 
the coming months his candidacy 
for the 2016 Republican presiden-
tial nomination, Texas Republi-
cans said Monday.

It would be the first time former 

President Bush — a former Texas 
governor and current resident 
of Dallas — has attended a fun-
draiser for his brother, who has 
been aggressively raising money 
for his political action committee 
from some of the GOP’s top donors 
for three months. It also comes as 
Jeb Bush nears the end of what is 
expected to be a successful fund-
raising quarter for the PAC.

WHO says politics 
didn’t sway Ebola 
emergency call

The World Health Organiza-

tion denied Monday that politics 
swayed the decision to declare 
an international emergency over 
the spread of the Ebola virus 
last year, despite evidence senior 
staffers repeatedly discussed the 
diplomatic and economic fallout 
of such a move.

A year after WHO declared 

that Ebola had been found in 
Guinea, the agency is on the 
defensive over reports that it 
dragged its feet when raising 
the international alarm over the 
disease. 
Internal 
communica-

tions published by The Associ-
ated Press last week documented 
senior agency staff discourag-
ing the move about two months 
before the international alert was 
finally raised, citing diplomatic 
relations, mining interests and 
the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.

Royster said he chose to run 

for Central Student Government 
to bring change, specifically to 
increase diversity on the Uni-

versity’s campus. Fidel said he 
decided to run to represent the 
students, pointing to members 
in the crowd and students walk-

In an e-mail interview, Heath-

er Croteau, a project associate 
at the Clean Energy Coalition 
and program manager of Arbor-
Bike, said she predicts the bike 
share program will have a posi-
tive impact on the city based on 
results in other communities 
that have bike shares.

“It’s an excellent addition to 

the community and the first sys-
tem of its kind in Michigan,” Cro-
teau said. “The impact is yet to 
be seen/determined but in other 
communities with bike share 

programs, the systems have 
become a major asset that users 
come to rely on to get around.”

Croteau also noted that Arbor-

Bike provides a healthy alterna-
tive to driving.

“ArborBike 
adds 
a 
non-

motorized option and additional 
diversity to Ann Arbor’s trans-
portation systems,” she said.

Riders may set up member-

ships for day, month and year 
passes at ArborBike.org, with 
fees starting at $6 per bike rent-
al. Additional fees apply for those 
who use bikes for more than 60 
minutes at a time.

On campus, ArborBike kiosks 

are located at the North Campus 
Recreation Building, at Murfin 
Avenue and Bonisteel Boulevard 
across from Pierpont Commons, 
Zina Pitcher Place and Catherine 
Street, by the Central Campus 
Recreation Building and near 
South Quad.

Councilmember Julie Grand 

(D–Ward 3) said ArborBike is a 
positive addition to Ann Arbor.

“I think it can really help 

encourage folks who maybe are 
a little hesitant about biking, and 
think that they would like to try 
it,” said Grand. “It gives them the 
opportunity to get out on a bike 
in a more high traffic area and 
see if it will work for them.”

Grand said she hopes Arbor-

Bike will encourage residents to 
consider using bikes as a method 
of transportation to work or 
to school. Grand also said she 
thinks ArborBike will benefit 
people visiting the city, provid-
ing them with an alternative to 
renting a car.

“They’ll have another option 

other than having to rent a car… 
and get around on a bike, which 
is exciting, and go out and see not 
just campus but some of the great 
amenities, things like our parks 
and other recreational amenities 
that the city has to offer.”

their platform.

“My main focus this year 

is definitely on talking to stu-
dents, student engagement and 
hearing student voices,” Colella 
said. “More than anything else 
we are here to represent the 
18,000 students in LSA and 
what they want.”

Colella added that his experi-

ences as a residential adviser at 
East Quad inspired some of the 
goals of their platform.

“Being an RA, you see so 

many different things and hear 
about so many different student 
concerns,” he said. “Working 
through all the student issues 
that I have encountered has 

been really enlightening.”

Colella and Klootwyk both 

said the LSA community should 
prepare to hear new ideas and 
plans, upon their election.

“The LSA community can 

really look forward to us hitting 
the ground running with proj-
ects, ideas and a strong push 
for student engagement and 
involvement,” Colella said.

Klootwyk said they want the 

LSA community to know they 
are passionate about being stu-

“We really do care about the 

needs of the students,” Kloot-
wyk said. “We will do whatever 
is in our power to make changes 
for them and see that any issues 
they have, Jason and I will make 
it apparent to get those fixed.”

madness — has certainly 

colored the Israeli experience 
in Africa,” Bar-Yosef said.

Deborah Starr, associate 

professor of modern Arabic 
and Hebrew literature and 
film at Cornell University, 
examined 
the 
movies 
of 

Egyptian 
filmmaker 
Togo 

Mizrahi, 
whose 
Jewish 

heritage played both implicit 
and 
explicit 
roles 
in 
his 

narratives, which were filmed 
mostly during the 1930s and 
1940s. Starr’s analysis focused 
on two of Mizrahi’s films, “On 
a Rainy Night” (1939) and “The 
Straight Path” (1943), and the 
interplay between Egyptian 
and Jewish representations in 
both.

“Togo Mizrahi’s films … 

explore the ambivalences of 
Egyptian-Jewish 
identity 

within and through colonial 
institutions,” Starr wrote in 
her research paper. “Although 
these films lack explicitly 
Jewish content, I aim to tease 
out how they reflect distinctly 
Jewish anxieties of belonging 

in Egypt under the British 
sphere of influence.”

In discussing the research, 

Bar-Yosef — following similar 
sentiments 
expressed 
by 

several 
members 
of 
the 

audience — pointed to the 
complexity of the impact of 
colonialism on Jewish and 
Arab communities.

“Zionism, 
the 
Zionist 

project and its relationship 
to colonialism, are complex,” 
Bar-Yosef said. “Just to see 
one of these angles would be 
to miss the larger picture … 
That’s what we’re trying to do 
here, point to complexity of 
these different images.”

Krutikov 
said 
the 

University is one of only three 
in the world with a program 
in advanced Judaic Studies — 
similar programs exist at the 
University of Pennsylvania 
and the Hebrew University 
of Jerusalem. Currently, the 
University 
also 
offers 
an 

undergraduate 
major 
and 

minor 
in 
Judaic 
Studies. 

Krutikov said the minor is a 
great opportunity for students 
who may not get a similar 
opportunity after graduation.

T

his past Saturday morning I 
thought it would be nice to 
have a kitten, so that after-

noon I went to the 
humane 
society. 

This is something 
my mom might 
call 
“impulsive 

decision-making,” 
but as it was she 
called it “being 
spontaneous” 
— 

probably because 
she’s the one who 
drove me to the 
animal shelter.

Adopting a kitten right now 

would be a bad idea for a multitude 
of reasons: my apartment doesn’t 
allow pets, I’m leaving the country 
in four months, and I’m allergic to 
cats. But I really wanted one. And 
that was more than good enough for 
my mom, because it’s the first thing 
I’ve actively wanted in a long time.

Let’s back up to last Friday, which 

is when I told my therapist that the 
only thing that made me feel okay 
was being with animals. It’d be nice, 
I said, to spend time with something 
alive and mildly social that didn’t 
require any conversation. I thought 
a dog might be good, or maybe a cat, 
since they aren’t as loud or such 
persistent mouth-breathers. “So go 
get one,” she said. Like it was just 
that easy. Animals could be very 
therapeutic, apparently.

When I recounted this interac-

tion to my mom, thinking she would 
also laugh at the oversimplification 
of how to solve my problem, she sur-
prised me by agreeing that I should 
just get one. She already had her car 
keys in hand. That’s when I realized 
just how desperately the people 
in my life wanted to help me. That 
they’d try anything — even jump-
ing in the car to go adopt a cat that 
didn’t make any sense for me to 
bring into my life. It reminded me 
of something of which I was already 

painfully aware: my problem affects 
the people around me.

I have struggled with depression 

for years now, which is something 
that I try to be very open about. 
But it gets harder to discuss frankly 
when I’m in the throes of it. It’s a 
kind of recurring nightmare that I 
can only comfortably recount when 
it’s long over. So when my attention 
started slipping early in the semes-
ter, I just tried not to think about 
it. It got harder to ignore when I 
began barely making assignment 
deadlines, then handing in assign-
ments late, then not handing them 
in at all. I don’t really want to talk 
about what depression feels like. 
Too many people already know the 
experience. But the effect is some-
thing that looks a lot like apathy, 
and leaves the people who care not 
knowing how to help.

So I got in the passenger seat of 

my mom’s car and my 15-year-old 
sister hopped into the back, imme-
diately speculating what kind of 
kitten would be best for me. She 
thought, most importantly, it ought 
to be a girl. My mom said to just pick 
a nice one. We got to the animal 
shelter 15 minutes before it closed 
and passed the cages of anxiously 
yowling dogs to a room where they 
kept the kittens, a room where 
they kept a kitten. All of the cages 
were empty except for one, where 
one kitten had pressed itself to the 
back wall, nearly invisible in the 
shadows. The sign said her name 
 

was Pumpkin.

Kittens aren’t usually born until 

spring, it turns out, but we weren’t 
immediately deterred by the lack 
of selection. My sister cooed and 
wiggled her fingers inside the 
cage, which surprisingly did rouse 
Pumpkin’s interest. My mom asked 
a volunteer if we could hold the kit-
ten, and she said no. It had bitten 
someone and we would have to fill 
out a lot of paper work, but there 

were some older cats in the front we 
could look at.

So we went to the front. There 

was a room with free-roaming 
cats lounging on the benches, and 
in a litter box was the largest cat 
I’ve ever seen. He was shaped like 
a meatloaf and took up the entire 
box. When we entered the room he 
tried to raise himself, but gave up 
the task when his heft proved too 
much to lift. I looked at my mom 
and 
grinned. 
“Absolutely 
not,” 
 

she said.

We pet some lazy cats and my 

sister took an obscene number of 
Snapchat videos, but eventually we 
had to leave empty-handed. I felt a 
little disappointed and a lot itchy (I 
really am allergic to cats).

When we got back in the car, 

my mom looked sadder than I did. 
“Now really isn’t a good time for me 
to get a cat anyway,” I said. She nod-
ded, but I still felt badly. She said she 
and my sister would keep looking 
while I was at school, and while I 
realized I had gotten over the whim 
of getting a new pet, I still told her 
that was a good idea. I felt I had to 
let her continue the obsessive kitten 
search, because while she couldn’t 
cure my depression, she could abso-
lutely scour the Internet for kittens 
for sale in Michigan.

The hard thing about recovering 

from depression is that it’s hard to 
take care of myself when I don’t nec-
essarily feel I’m worth taking care 
of. Yet I allowed myself to get swept 
up in the cat mania because my mom 
hoped a cat could cure me, and if I 
couldn’t make myself happy, I could 
at least try to make her happy. The 
fix might not be as easy as adopt-
ing a new pet, but maybe that’s how 
recovery works sometimes: you try 
to help the people who care to help 
you, even if you can’t help yourself.

C

entral Student Government elections will be held March 
25 and March 26, with candidates from The Team, Make 
Michigan and the Defend Affirmative Action Party all vying 

for positions on CSG. As the representative body for students at the 
University, CSG must take on the pressing issues facing the University, 
its administration and its students, as well as incorporate voices from 
all students on campus. Sexual assault, mental health and diversity 
are crucial issues on campus. All of them must be considered and 
dealt with by CSG under its next administration. Inclusivity and the 
mobilization of student groups must also be a focus of CSG. While the 
parties present platforms that seem to tackle these points, only one 
party and its candidates have the experience and inclusivity needed 
in order to practically take on these issues. With reservations, The 
Michigan Daily’s editorial board endorses The Team.

Heading The Team’s ticket are LSA junior 

Will Royster and LSA sophomore Matt Fidel, 
running for president and vice president, 
respectively. 
Royster 
has 
no 
previous 

experience on CSG, but currently serves as 
academic concerns chair for the Black Student 
Union. Fidel is an LSA representative for CSG 
and previously sat on the Social Responsibility 
Committee for the now disbanded Sigma 
Alpha Mu fraternity. In an interview with the 
editorial board, it was evident Royster and Fidel 
are passionate leaders, dedicated to bettering 
the campus community. They stressed the 
importance of increasing diversity on campus 
and the need for cross-collaboration on campus 
to tackle the most important issues students 
face. This is reflected in The Team’s platform.

Additionally, plans to increase on-site 

recruitment programs for underrepresented 
communities 
and 
to 
move 
the 
Trotter 

Multicultural Center to a more accessible 
location would be welcome in beginning to 
address diversity issues. Initiatives to make 
CSG more transparent and a larger presence 
on campus, such as creating a coffee cart in 
Mason Hall staffed by CSG representatives, a 
text-message hotline to voice concerns and an 
opt-in interactive newsletter are respectable 
initiatives that should be carried out.

But what separates The Team from the other 

parties is a developed, tangible plan to expand 
mental health services on campus. Royster and 
Fidel intend to work with the administration to 
bring Counseling and Psychological Services to 
both North Campus and residence halls. While 
the Wolverine Support Network has launched 
with a successful start, it simply cannot 
replace 
professional 
counseling. 
Making 

mental health services more accessible could 
lead to more students who need counseling 
getting care. If this were the only thing The 
Team accomplished in the next year, it would 
certainly be a successful term.

That said, the editorial board has reservations 

about The Team’s platform, stated goals and 
ability to command the executive branch of 
CSG. Their platform, while calling for the 
prevention of sexual assault on campus, does so 
via the expansion of education for faculty and 
staff. This expanded education does not cover 
the most important segment of campus: the 
students. The Team relies on the student groups 
and organizations that already exist on campus 
to continue the education process of students 
with regard to sexual assault and sexual assault 
prevention. In addition, The Team’s support 
of the “Companion” application targets only 
a small aspect of the sexual assault issue — 
attacks at night by strangers — as a significant 
portion of sexual assault take place in the home 
of the survivor or the perpetrator. During their 
interview with the editorial board, Royster and 
Fidel provided lackluster plans for crucial issues 
on campus. When asked about issues surrounding 
Greek life at the University, Royster stated that 
the implementation of programs to focus on the 
standards of brotherhood and scholarship are 
necessary for dealing with the perceived issues 
with Greek life. This plan lacked in detail and, 
thus, practicality. Another lacking area of The 
Team was their stance on diversity. While The 
Team posits practical and informed courses of 
action when dealing with issues of diversity, these 
plans largely avoid the issue of diversity outside 
of race, namely with regards to the LGBTQ 
community. The Team appears to have focused on 
a diversity of candidates as opposed to a diversity 
of ideas, leading the editorial board to have issues 
with the plans put forth under their platform.

Finally, the actions of the recently disbanded 

Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity on their ski trip and 
Fidel’s subsequent handling of the issues raises 
questions about his ability to lead during trying 
times. In an interview last month about the ski 
trip, despite knowing it would be possible to 
decline comment, The Team’s campaign manager 
Jacob Abudaram, an LSA junior, refused to 
continue the interview with Fidel and the Daily 
until the reporter promised not to ask Fidel’s 

personal involvement in the incident. This event 
is concerning and not respectable conduct for 
potential campus leaders. 

LSA junior Cooper Charlton and LSA 

sophomore Steven Halperin lead Make Michigan 
in this election. Charlton is currently president 
of the University’s Student-Athlete Advisory 
Committee and Halperin is a current LSA 
representative. Under the current leadership 
of Public Policy Senior Bobby Dishell, Make 
Michigan has put several notable programs 
into action, such as need-based ticket prices for 
financially disadvantaged students, maintaining 
the Night Owl late-night bus service and 
beginning the Wolverine Support Network. 
However, this year’s platform offers either 
small-scale or ineffective policies that fail to 
recognize larger issues that face the campus. 
While Charlton’s record working with University 
administration and receptiveness to critical 
feedback give us faith in his leadership abilities, 
problems with the platform begin with the ideas 
for increasing diversity and combating sexual 
assault. Make Michigan intends to implement 
SEED faculty training, a for-profit program 
which educates faculty members on inclusion. 
However, the Program on Intergroup Relations 
already exists. While IGR is currently designed 
for students, it promotes a similar agenda to SEED. 
Therefore, it would be wiser to use resources the 
University has to develop a program for faculty, 
as redundancy is not needed. Furthermore, while 
increasing on-campus lighting to promote a safer 
atmosphere for students walking at night is a 
worthwhile effort, as it may make students feel 
safer, it does not effectively combat the culture 
that surrounds sexual assault — something that 
urgently needs to be addressed.

Lastly, Make Michigan touts a new Student 

Honor Code that will transcend the existing 
individual school codes; however, the Statement 
of Student Rights and Responsibilities is already 
in place — a fact addressed in a previous editorial. 
Simply put, the Make Michigan platform does not 
add up to the potent leadership and initiative that 
is essential to successful CSG governance.

Leading the Defend Affirmative Action 

Party — which is tightly linked to minority 
rights advocacy group BAMN — are LSA 
junior Keysha Wall and LSA sophomore Katie 
Kennedy running for CSG president and CSG 
vice president. The party is passionate about 
systemic issues, such as racism and bigotry, and 
wants to increase diversity and transparency 
on campus. While these are urgent concerns 
of the University, the party is too focused on 
a single issue, and therefore lacks the breadth 
of experience and knowledge required of CSG 
leadership. This is on top of the fact that both 
candidates lack experience working with 
University administration — a must-have for a 
student representative.

The Central Student Government should 

incorporate all student voices to effectively 
represent the entire student body on campus. 
All parties’ platforms voice student concerns 
but do not properly establish programs that will 
effectively combat these issues. The Michigan 
Daily’s editorial board is endorsing The Team 
because their platform most thoroughly 
addresses issues of diversity on campus by 
working with student groups such as the Black 
Student Union; issues of mental health by 
expanding CAPS to more locations; and issues 
of sexual assault by providing faculty training. 
Despite our endorsement, we urge The Team 
to expand its initiatives to combat sexual 
assault culture on campus, including education 
programs for student organization. The Team 
must work to repair the negative perception 
surrounding Fidel as a result of Sigma Alpha 
Mu’s dissolution and the fraternity’s handling 
of the issues stemming from their ski trip. 
The Team presents ideas and claims to be

FROM THE DAILY

 
 

— Republican presidential candidate and Texas Senator Ted Cruz said to a three-year-old girl at 
 

a recent campaign event in New Hampshire. 
“

NOTABLE QUOTABLE

The world is on fire. Yes! Your world is on 
fire. But you know what? Your mommy’s 
here and everyone’s here to make sure the 

world you grow up in is better.”

Why I joined The Team

At first glance, a token seems like 

a valuable thing. A token is a symbol 
of importance, wealth and worth. A 
token is not light — it seems to carry 
some weight. But the truth is that 
tokens are only symbols of worth; 
they don’t hold any real value. Too 
often on this campus, my identities 
have been tokenized. My brownness 
and my gender have been used to 
“diversify” a room of campus lead-
ers. My voice, my experiences and 
my feelings have been swept aside 
by people who promised they would 
listen — those I trusted to validate 
my narratives. For them, my physi-
cal presence was enough to fill the 
quota for diversity in the room, 
 

nothing more.

As this year’s CSG election sea-

son approached, I didn’t have 
any desire to be involved in cam-
paign politics. I was content with 
the work I am doing with student 
leaders and administrators from 
across campus. We have made great 
strides to promote interfaith collab-
oration, combat sexual violence and 
increase campus accessibility this 
year. But still, I felt uneasy about my 

decision to stay out of all the elec-
tioneering. I knew that I couldn’t 
stand by and watch another year of 
typical campaigns. I needed to take 
part in changing the culture of CSG 
elections. I wanted to support can-
didates who honestly live out their 
values; candidates who serve with 
humility, strive to develop a deep 
understanding of the issues that 
face our campus and are willing to 
fight for change; candidates who 
focus on the well-being of the stu-
dent body. I wanted to support can-
didates who truly value my voice 
and the voices of my peers.

Before this school year, I didn’t 

know Will Royster or Matt Fidel. 
When I first spoke to them about 
their candidacy, I questioned their 
desire to get involved in CSG at the 
executive level. I wanted to know 
about their track records on cam-
pus — what had they accomplished 
so far? I asked about their motiva-
tions for running — were they in it 
for the right reasons? After some 
long conversations, I decided I 
had to join The Team. There was 
no longer any doubt in my mind. 

I am constantly inspired by Will’s 
humility and desire to improve 
the campus climate. With Will, 
it’s never about him; it was always 
about The Team. Will’s genuine 
desire to listen to all narratives, 
as well as his selfless leadership, 
makes him the ideal candidate 
for student body president. I am 
thoroughly impressed with Matt’s 
work in the social justice realm 
on campus. His thoughtfulness, 
open-mindedness 
and 
genuine 

compassion 
undoubtedly 
make 

him the right choice for the next 
 

vice president.

The Team’s party leadership and 

representative slate are some of 
the most outstanding people I have 
worked with on campus. As I enter 
every meeting for The Team, I am 
embraced with warmth and love. 
We say “there’s a place for everyone 
on The Team” and we mean it.

Polls are open at vote.umich.

choose to join The Team.

TV REVIEW
Marling echoes 
retro heartbreak

Singer-songwriter’s 

new album takes 
influence from the 
West Coast greats

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Music Editor

“To find a queen without a king 

/ They say she plays guitar and 
cries and sings”

Legend has it that these lyrics 

from the famous 
Led 
Zeppelin 

record, 
“Going 

to 
California,” 

were written by 
the Robert Plant 
and Jimmy Page 
upon 
meeting 

Joni 
Mitch-

ell among the 
groupies and drugged-up music 
scene of California in the ’70s. Her 
ethereal appearance, free-form 
spirit and inexplicably firm grasp 
on the emotions of the human 
heart had the boys enamored, leav-
ing her as an object of affection for 
the hopelessly romantic, exces-
sively drugged rock ‘n’ rollers of 
the California communes.

Joni held her fair share of heart-

break, too. Her 1971 album, Blue, 
with its octave-jumping vocals, 
glossy piano and acoustic guitar 
instrumentations, is still consid-
ered one of the most perfect rela-
tionship postmortem records. It’s 
a retrospective looking back on 
the good and bad of a relationship, 
with added reflections of her expe-
riences in California and tattered 
relationships — drawing the face 
of Leonard Cohen on the map of 
Canada in “A Case of You” — and 
continues to sonically mend the 
breaking hearts of today.

A critical eye can easily demar-

cate the modern folk/singer-song-
writer genre as one domineered 
by men. Back in the ’60s and ’70s, 
Joni was matched by a number 
of 
female 
singer-songwriters: 

Carly Simon, Carole King, Janis 
Ian and Joan Baez, just to name a 
few. The music anthologies of the 
past decade are seemingly lacking 
popular, well-written female folk 
music. Much is seemingly lost to 
the electronics and production 
styles of the 21st century. To rescue 
the genre, to pioneer a voice similar 
to that of the all feeling, unafraid 
Joni – a woman finding confidence 

and understanding in her poetic 
description of her life experiences 
– is found in a 25-year-old, pixie-
cut, thin English young woman. 
The voice Joni once provided so 
many decades ago is recreated 
and individualized in the musical 
anthology of Laura Marling.

The daughter of a recording 

studio owner, Marling was the 
youngest daughter of three to 
the Sir Charles William Som-
erset Marling, the 5th Marling 
Baronet. Her introduction to 
music was early, and by the age 
of sixteen she had written her 
first hit in the light, simple single 
“New 
Romantic.” 
Re-settling 

on the outskirts of London with 
her sisters, Marling’s career took 
off almost immediately. She was 
swept into numerous impressive 
recording studios and the “nu-
folk” community that had begun 
to emerge from the London music 
scene in the mid-’00s, among the 
like being the now-famous names 
of Mumford & Sons, Noah and the 
Whale, Johnny Flynn or Emmy 
the Great. Laura performed and 
recorded with these acts in her 
early career, and famously fell 
into romantic relationships with 
two of these burgeoning artists. 
In a very Joni fashion, Laura has 
songs written about her by ex-
boyfriends Marcus Mumford and 
Charlie Fink.

Laura’s thoughts on love and 

romance 
are 
unchangeably 

embedded in her lyrics over her 
past four albums. Vacillating flaw-
lessly between the vulnerability, 
hurt and bliss of relationships of 
the personal and fictional kind, 
her past four albums have carried 
breathtaking, yet similar, lyrical 
themes with undeniably congru-
ent instrumentations — some-
times hazy or sometimes stormy 
production styles, an acoustic 
guitar and Marling’s immensely 
intriguing vocal range. So in order 
to descend from her consistencies, 
to escape her doubts in her early-
fame music career, and to re-cen-
ter her life’s inspiration, Laura, 
like Joni, went to California.

“How did I get lost looking for 

God in Santa Cruz? / Where you 
go to lose your mind” sings Mar-
ling on “Easy.” Marling trans-
formed her world prior to her 
writing and recording of her fifth 
studio album, Short Movie. She 
moved to Los Angeles in 2012 
for a boy she had fallen in love 
with, but a short amount of time 

revealed that her visa was to last 
much longer than the relation-
ship. She decided to extend her 
time in the States, bought a house 
in California and drove around to 
indifferent regions of the United 
States to perform small and com-
pletely self-organized gigs. In 
her recent interview with The 
Guardian, Marling describes her-
self as “physically wrecked and 
spiritually broken” by her time on 
the road and decided to take six 
months off. Here, she truly came 
undone: applying anonymously 
and then facing rejection from 
a poetry workshop in Saratoga 
Springs, New York, taking up a 
small restaurant job in California 
to cover excess costs and spend-
ing time with the shamans and 
hippies she met in the small places 
of California.

With this new collection of 

experiences, voices and perspec-
tives Marling reworked her sound 
into an exquisite album. To match 
the underlying aggression, the 
album’s sound and lyrics appear 
to hold, Short Movie adds more 
electric guitar and heavy pro-
duction sounds than any album 
Marling has previously recorded. 
There’s more room to the album’s 
songs, with less strict acoustic 
guitar lines and more fading bass 
notes. Despite the album’s inno-
vation, however, Short Movie 
continues to hold the honest and 
storytelling lyrics Marling has 
consistently provided. “I don’t 
believe this shit / You know I 
was doing fine without it” sings 
Marling in “Walk Alone” as she 
beckons herself to rediscover her 
independence following the rejec-
tion of a former love. Poetic anec-
dotes continue in the electrified 
track “False Hope,” a song that 
illustrates Marling’s experience 
on the Upper West Side of New 
York City during 2014’s Hurricane 
Sandy storms.

But in the album’s title track, 

“Short Movie,” the greatest poetic 
punch is found. Quoting the life 
mantra of a shaman shared with 
her in a California bar, Marling 
excessively repeats, “It’s a short 
fucking movie, man.” For Mitch-
ell or Marling listeners, those who 
connect and thrive on their musi-
cal poetry, there is much to gain 
from shaman’s advice: Despite the 
doubts, heartaches, and never-
ending life crises, sometimes the 
life analysis must end and the liv-
ing must continue.

The problem with 
celebrities and art

O

h, MoMA. The New 
York museum, consid-
ered the world’s top 

resource for modern art, has 
been undergo-
ing serious 
flack for its 
universally 
panned ret-
rospective on 
the indescrib-
able Icelandic 
tour de force, 
Björk. The New 
Yorker called 
it “embarrass-
ing,” The Atlantic preferred 
“misconceived.” Art Net News 
settled for a headline that 
proved both straightforward 
and scathing: “Ladies and 
Gentlemen, the Björk Show 
at MoMA is Bad, Really Bad.” 
Even in an ambitious Google 
search you’d be hard pressed 
to find any semblance of a 
positive reaction to the event, 
which still plans to run until 
June 7. The question of the tip 
of every art critic’s tongue is, to 
put it bluntly, how did MoMA 
fuck up so bad?

While I haven’t been able 

to see the exhibit in person, 
all accounts say pretty much 
the same thing. The exhibit is 
sparse and the setup is horribly 
inconvenient for foot traf-
fic. An accompanying audio 
recording proves both bizarre 
and disconcerting for listen-
ers and distracts from the 
artifacts that highlight Björks 
multi-decade career. The 
Economist even accused the 

show of fetishizing the ethereal 
foreignness of the singer into 
some sort of intrepid pixie. 
Yikes.

The Museum of Modern Art 

has a longstanding relation-
ship with celebrity artists. The 
museum held a retrospective of 
macabre director Tim Burton 
in 2009 (also deemed subpar 
by critics, but not to the extent 
of the Björk show), Marina 
Abramovic sat in a chair for 
two months in 2010 and stared 
at a rotating array of strangers 
and celebrities and Tilda Swin-
ton slept in a glass box in the 
museum’s atrium for six hours 
in 2013. These shows are fun to 
attend and provide an interest-
ing experience that viewers 
can’t find anywhere else, and, 
alternatively, they bring in a 
ton of revenue with tourists 
who want to tell their friends, 
“Yeah, I saw Tilda sleep in a 
glass box. It was no big deal.” 
However, it’s the style of exhib-
iting, almost exploiting the 
celebrity that often dilutes the 
intention of the artist, and it 
falls on the audience to realize 
that they’re getting the short 
end of the stick, which the 
attendees of the Björk exhibit 
became aware of.

The Bjork disaster exempli-

fies a problem that has been 
creeping into modern art for 
quite some time: When a big 
name is behind the art, it 
becomes too easy to lean on the 
celebrity and not the content, 
leaving much to be desired for 
the viewer. The celebrity prob-

lem is not exclusive to MoMA 
or the world of modern art. A 
similar problem plagued the 
recent debut of Yeezy Season 
1, a ready-to-wear collabora-
tion between adidas Originals 
and rapper Kanye West. Crit-
ics’s reactions varied, but the 
majority rode the line between 
“eh” and accusations of copy-
ing established designers 
like Rick Owens. While it’s 
anticipated the line will sell 
big (it was recently announced 
that the luxury department 
store Barney’s will begin to 
sell the collection later this 
year), the question of artistic 
merit remains the same: Is the 
product selling because of the 
face behind the collection or 
because of its content?

In a way, this is the ultimate 

question of artistic taste. As 
audiences and consumers, we 
often buy into fashion and art 
due to the famous connotations 
behind them. We’re excited 
by the possibility of finding a 
tangible way to connect with 
our favorite celebrities, and 
the veil of stardom provides 
a convenient cover for lack-
ing substance. MoMA learned 
the hard way with the Björk 
retrospective, but in creating a 
highly publicized example of a 
collection gone bad, audiences 
can learn to be wary of what is 
a gimmick and what is art.

TV REVIEW
‘Bloodline’ unnerves

By HAILEY MIDDLEBROOK

Daily Arts Writer

This past Friday brought two 

things: the beginning of spring 
and the release of “Bloodline” on 
Netflix. 
Upon 

first 
glance, 

these 
events 

didn’t seem too 
far removed, for 
both marked the 
start of a sea-
son — one with 
warmer weath-
er, renewed rela-
tionships and fresh hope for the 
future.

Set in the emerald-hued hum 

of the Florida Keys, “Blood-
line” follows the Rayburns, a 
prominent island family with 
a successful beachside inn. To 
celebrate the 45th anniversary 
of the family business, Mama 
(Sissy Spacek, “The Help”) and 
Papa (Sam Shepard, “Mud”) Ray-
burn have invited their four adult 
children and dozens of guests to 
a party draped with Mason-jar 
lanterns and champagne — a sun-
dress affair with kicked-off cork 
wedges, salty breezes and bare 
feet spraying sand into the green 
Gulf Stream. Sounds like the kind 
of summer-dreaming indulgence 
everyone needs to watch come 
springtime, right?

But as anyone familiar with the 

tropics knows, it’s not all margari-
tas and sunshine. Wetness doesn’t 
just stay in the sea — it pervades 
the land, floods murky mangroves 
and drenches its inhabitants, mak-

ing everything just soggy enough 
to never dry out completely. Like-
wise, though the Rayburns wear 
cheery faces, something very dark 
festers beneath their surface like a 
hidden pocket of mold. 

For “Bloodline” viewers, how-

ever, the Rayburns’s shady past is 
made painstakingly visible. The 
first episode opens with a gor-
geous view of the islands’ Seven 
Mile Bridge surrounded by water, 
coupled with a foreboding voice-
over: “Sometimes, you know 
something’s coming. You can feel 
it. In the air. In your gut. And you 
don’t sleep at night. The voice in 
your head is telling you that some-
thing is going to go terribly wrong 
and there’s nothing you can do to 
stop it.”

The voice is soon revealed to be 

John “the Pope” Rayburn’s, the 
middle son of the family whose 
moral duties as sheriff extend 
far beyond the police headquar-
ters, a role naturally filled by Kyle 
Chandler (“Friday Night Lights”). 
Perpetually wearing a shirt and 
tie despite the searing heat, John 
plays the father figure among his 
siblings — his word is final, though 
it may not always be as fair and 
good as his reassuring voice spins 
it to be. 

As sheriff, John can sense an 

imminent threat — the “some-
thing’s coming” he warns of is 
his older brother, Danny, played 
by Australian actor Ben Men-
delsohn 
(“The 
Dark 
Knight 

Rises”). Labeled frequently as 
the “black sheep” of the family, 
Danny obviously sticks out among 

the other Rayburns — where the 
other children have resided close 
to their parents in Florida, Danny 
has been M.I.A. His clothes are 
greasy, his pockets jammed with 
pain medicine and cigarettes. 
Though his intentions seem inno-
cent — coming to his family’s cel-
ebration, bringing home a date, 
having a drink with dad — Danny’s 
body language oozes threat. He 
downs his rum a little too quick-
ly; the date he brings is intoler-
ably drunk. His movements ripple 
tension along the beach, causing 
everyone to question his real rea-
sons for returning. 

Danny’s presence rocks the 

Rayburns the most, who all seem 
to hold something against him. 
The youngest son and “hot-head” 
of the family, Kevin (Norbert Leo 
Butz, “Dan in Real Life”), is con-
vinced that his brother is back for 
revenge, aiming to hurt both the 
family and the inn. Meanwhile 
their sister, Meg (Linda Cardel-
lini, “Freaks and Geeks”), is a law-
yer and struggles to choose a side 
that won’t make her the bad guy 
— by agreeing with her father that 
Danny should be sent away, she’d 
lose her older brother forever.

Though they all have different 

reasons to dread their brother’s 
return, through jolting flashbacks 
and flashforwards, it becomes 
clear that something in the past 
— and in the near future — went 
horribly wrong. So if the first few 
episodes of “Bloodline” seem to 
be stuck in the doldrums, keep in 
mind that there’s always a calm 
before the storm.

TV REVIEW
Harrowing ‘24 Days’

By LAUREN WOOD

For The Daily

From the opening scene, “24 

Days,” directed by Alexandre 
Arcady (“What the Day Owes 
the 
Night”) 

and 
released 

last April, does 
not let you for-
get that it’s not 
just 
a 
crime 

drama; it’s the 
recreation of a 
horrifying and 
very true event. Following the 
kidnapping and eventual death of 
young Frenchman Ilan Halimi, 
the victim of a vicious 2006 
anti-Semitic crime that sparked 
a series of massive protests, the 
film works to further personalize 
the cataclysmic event and remind 
its audience that, at the heart of 
this larger issue of French anti-
Semitism, there was one young 
man and his family. 

After Shabbat dinner in Janu-

ary 2006, Ilan Halimi (Syrus Sha-
hidi, “Quantum Love”) leaves to 
get drinks with a mysterious girl 
he met earlier that day at work. 
His family, who believes he’s 
with his girlfriend, thinks little 

of his late night. While wonder-
ing why he isn’t at lunch the next 
day, his family receives a harrow-
ing e-mail demanding an impos-
sible ransom in exchange for 
Ilan’s life. They are set on a tur-
bulent and emotionally charged 
path, negotiating with the police 
and the large network of kidnap-
pers for over three weeks before 
Ilan is released unexpectedly, 
dying en route to the hospital 
from injuries sustained after 
weeks of torture.

A gripping story in itself, the 

narrative structure of the film 
is straightforward and entirely 
plot-driven, forcing the viewer to 
experience the story alongside the 
family and kidnappers as changes 
are made to the case. The focus 
shifts chronologically between 
the two groups as information 
about Ilan’s captors is revealed 
and the police learn more about 
the large network of criminals, 
from the bottom-tier beautiful 
“lures” (attractive women hired 
as bait to entice their targets and 
get them alone) and mindless 
musclemen all the way to a ruth-
less mastermind working from 
the Ivory Coast. This focus seems 
to detract from the experiences 
of the family and risks shifting 
our sympathies to the lower-
tier criminals coerced into the 
group out of financial necessity. 
We experience the family’s life 
through the structure of major 
plot points, and while this does 
force the viewer to experience 
every facet of the horrifying case, 
it also ends up almost depersonal-
izing the family as each new piece 
of information is presented in the 
same way as the last. It’s easy to 

become emotionally numb to the 
barrage of tormenting twists, 
and there’s little room to breathe 
between the concentration of 
impactful scenes, detracting from 
the 
harrowing 
performances 

from Ilan’s parents and sisters.

It’s Ilan’s mother, Ruth Halimi 

(Zabou Breitman, “The First Day 
of the Rest of Your Life”), who 
reclaims the film’s humanity with 
bookended direct addresses to the 
audience. While the film seems 
to lose its focus in the middle and 
edge into the realm of crime dra-
mas, these moments of vulner-
able honesty effectively bring the 
emphasis back on Ilan’s impact on 
the French-Jewish community 
and reminds its audience that this 
high-intensity story isn’t a trick 
for the screen, it’s an attempt to 
capture the truth of unbelievable 
real life events. Although Ilan is 
seen throughout the film dur-
ing his imprisonment, we know 
little about him and are left to 
understand his character through 
the eyes of his family as they 
simultaneously fight for his life 
and mourn the loss of their son, 
brother and friend. Because of 
this, the film’s success hinges on 
our ability to connect with those 
most invested in his survival. 
After watching the story evolve 
from the family’s initial and 
very personal shock to the mas-
sive riots against anti-Semitic 
crimes, the appearance of Ruth 
at the open and close of the story 
allows viewers to re-contextual-
ize the events they have watched 
be blown to epic proportions, 
keeping the story from becom-
ing commoditized on screen and 
retain its humanity.

Internet revival

Fan favorite 
‘Community’ 

returns to Yahoo 

Screen

By ADAM THEISEN

Senior Arts Editor

“Community” is immortal. Not 

only has it survived practically cer-
tain death by cancellation multiple 
years in a row, 
but it has gone on 
to outlast every 
comedy 
NBC 

tried to replace it 
with. Now, a few 
cast 
members 

short, the show 
has moved from 
network TV to 
Yahoo 
Screen, 

where 
it 
will 

serve not as the 
main 
product, 

but as a means 
to draw the few-million, fiercely 
loyal 
remaining 
“Community” 

fans into the fledgling online plat-
form. Though it’s missing a few key 
organs (only four of the seven in the 
original group are still at Green-
dale), what’s left of the show is just 
as alive and unique as Franken-
stein’s monster. “Community” isn’t 
quite as quick or groundbreaking as 
it was in its prime, and it now exists 
in such a bubble of its own creation 
that it’s impossible to imagine the 
show as accessible to anyone check-
ing it out for the first time. Howev-
er, the first two episodes of the sixth 
season are more than entertaining 
enough for hardcore fans, and after 
all these incarnations, “Communi-
ty” is still funnier and more unique 
than it has any right to be.

The fantastic cold open of the 

first episode will likely be a sea-

son highlight. After a classic Dean 
(Jim Rash, “The Way Way Back”) 
announcement to, as Abed (Danny 
Pudi, “Captain America: The Win-
ter Soldier”) puts it, “catch every-
one up,” (“Welcome to Greendale! 
Now ranked fifth on Colorado’s 
alphabetical listing of commu-
nity colleges! Rest in peace, Fatboy 
Slim’s DJ School”), the one problem 
that the group forgot to solve last 
season comes back to bite them: the 
roof collapses due to an overload of 
Frisbees.

Soon after, we’re introduced to 

Francesca “Frankie” Dart (Paget 
Brewster, “Criminal Minds”), a 
consultant brought to Greendale to 
fix all of its problems. The always 
hyper-aware Abed describes the 
pompous Frankie as having “the 
most interesting take on not being 
interesting,” as she appears to be 
devoid of quirks and entirely pro-
fessional. She immediately imposes 
rationality on the school, solving 
many of its ridiculous problems in a 
much faster way than the old “Save 
Greendale” group ever did.

For a while, her plans work, but 

Jeff (Joel McHale, “The Soup”), 
Britta (Gillian Jacobs, “Life Part-
ners”) and Annie (Alison Brie, 
“The Lego Movie”) quickly rebel, 
setting up a secret speakeasy in 
the back of Shirley’s old sandwich 
shop. The rationality that Frankie 
tries to impose on the whimsical-
ity of Greendale calls to mind the 
conflict of Captain Hook and Peter 
Pan’s Lost Boys, in which the study 
group that’s been stuck at a low-tier 
community college for six years 
continues to use Greendale as a way 
to avoid growing up or facing the 
real world.

The second episode contains 

a funny, if a bit insignificant, plot 
featuring the Dean’s new entirely 
inefficient virtual-reality system, in 
which simple tasks require incredi-

ble fitness (to delete a file, for exam-
ple, one must slowly suffocate it in 
water). This storyline mainly served 
to introduce new group member 
Elroy Patashnik (Keith David, “The 
Princess and the Frog”), a tech 
inventor who has seen better days. 
Patashnik, as the gruff older guy, 
replaces last season’s Buzz Hickey 
(Jonathan Banks, “Breaking Bad”), 
who replaced Chevy Chase’s origi-
nal Pierce Hawthorne. 

The other main plot of episode 

two features our first-ever meeting 
with Britta’s parents. Though Britta 
has been rebelling against her par-
ents since the show began, this epi-
sode revealed that, well, there’s not 
much to be rebelling against. Her 
parents are lovable hippies who are 
infatuated with their daughter, and 
make the closest contact they can 
by covertly assisting Britta finan-
cially through her friends. Britta’s 
freak-out when she discovers this 
news and long-term imagined 
rebellion establishes her once again 
as the character that “Community” 
has never gotten quite right. After 
playing Jeff’s intellectual equal in 
the early episodes, Britta has spent 
years backsliding into the role of 
the group’s ditzy screw-up, a char-
acterization that can be funny, but 
just doesn’t feel natural. It’s the one 
area of “Community” where Dan 
Harmon and crew’s incisive wit just 
doesn’t hit the mark.

The beginning of “Community” 

’s sixth season shows us that the 
show can be just as silly as it ever 
was. Though it has flaws — and it 
has regularly been flawed through 
its entire run — those flaws can be 
forgiven when a show is as different 
and hysterical as “Community.” It’s 
not meant for the casual fans, but 
if the episodes keep up in quality, 
hardcore fans will be watching the 
show for as long as its characters 
are stuck at Greendale.

Rap and the cross-
cultural experience

By REGAN DETWILER

For The Daily

I’m the last person you 

would guess that listens to rap. 
Though I respect it as an art 
form and am amazed by the tal-
ent of musicians such as The 
Notorious B.I.G, Lauryn Hill, 
Jay Z and Drake, I’ve just never 
been into it. As an former ballet 
dancer and eager British alter-
native-pop listener, it’s almost 
comical to imagine my some-
times high-strung, neurotic self 
attempting to dance to some-
thing like Kendrick Lamar’s 
good kid, m.A.A.d city.

Another thing: I’m a middle 

class white girl who grew up 
in a Midwestern suburb that 
was 89.6 percent white in 2010. 
The first time I even started 
hearing any real rap — rap that 
wasn’t just featured in a pop 
song — was at high school par-
ties, where I would see other 
privileged white teenagers nod-

ding their heads and rapping 
along. At these parties I would 
observe my peers and con-
sciously listen. I would listen 
to the lyrics behind the heavy 
beats and the often cacopho-
nous syllables spewing from 
the rappers’ mouths. What I 
heard were anthems of life in 
the streets, of gang violence and 
innocence lost to institutional-
ized racism that plagues our 
society. What I saw were my 
white peers nodding along as if 
they understood. 

It seemed to me like my peers 

only listened to rap in order 
to adopt some sort of image, 
to exude an attitude of cool, 
of detached understanding of 
what’s really going on. But the 
lyrics 
told 
heart-wrenching 

stories of tragedy – of hurt, of 
oppression, of death, of cop-
ing. And these traumas are the 
harms inflicted largely upon 
members of the Black popula-
tion in America and elsewhere, 
not of the stereotypical, afflu-
ent white kid. 

Along 
with 
my 
apparent 

inability to dance like a normal 
person, it was this element of 
rap in the context of my identity 
and my listening environment 
that made me feel uncomfort-
able nodding and swaying to 
the beat. How could I pretend 
to empathize with such heavy 
damages?

The root of my discomfort is 

that I felt like I couldn’t justifi-
ably enjoy the music if I didn’t 
fully understand the cultural 
background of the musician, 
especially as a member of the 
group 
that 
has 
historically 

oppressed the people who iden-
tify with this culture. 

I started throwing this idea 

around with friends, one of 
whom challenged me in a way 
that sort of eliminated the issue 
of race. This friend identifies 
with rap because she grew up in 
a very rural area whose inhab-
itants have a generally lower 
socioeconomic status, resulting 
in hardships similar to those 
referenced in a lot of rap lyrics. 
Although she’s white and the 
area she grew up in is predomi-
nantly white, other elements 
of her life allow her to deeply 
empathize with the true mean-
ings of the music.

The recent release of Ken-

drick 
Lamar’s 
new 
album 

To Pimp A Butterfly is what 
sparked this introspection into 
my own disconnect with rap. 
Having read a book about ado-
lescents in the drug exchange of 
Detroit in Anthro 101 and now 
taking a linguistic anthropol-

ogy class called Language and 
Discrimination, I felt like I had 
a new understanding of the 
Black community’s experiences 
in places like Compton, where 
Lamar is from, when I listened 
to the album. 

After listening to it, I started 

reading some articles about the 
artist and his latest release. In a 
piece from the New York Times, 
Kendrick says, “You take a kid 
out of Compton, and he has to 
meet these different types of 
people that are not black,” ref-
erencing the sense of obligation 
he feels to communicate with 
his ever-expanding fan base.

Though 
his 
fan 
base 
is 

increasingly diverse and he 
does seem to feel an obligation 
to communicate with popula-
tions that aren’t Black, Kendrick 
emphasizes in this article that 
he isn’t creating music for the 
purpose of commercial success. 
If anything, both the sound and 
lyrics of To Pimp A Butterfly are 
more dense than in his previous 
releases, “daring fans to invest 
in close readings” instead of 
selling out. He’s forcing his 
broad fan base to confront the 
issues that are at the heart of 
mainstream rap, regardless of 
listeners’ backgrounds.

All of the things I’m men-

tioning seem to raise the same 
question: Is it possible to enjoy 
music without understanding 
the cultural background and 
empathizing with the emotion-
al experiences of the musician? 
This question, however, has the 
underlying 
assumption 
that 

affluent white kids listening to 
rap, who make up a substan-
tial portion of Lamar’s follow-
ers, aren’t understanding or 
empathizing with what they’re 
listening to. Though this may 
seem like the case on the out-
side, it may not be entirely true. 
 

What led me to this conclu-

sion is another one of Lamar’s 
quotes from the same article. 
“This is me pouring out my soul 
on the record,” he said. “You’re 
gonna feel it because you too 
have pain. It might not be like 
mine, but you’re gonna feel it.”

That’s what converted me. 

With race relations in the Unit-
ed States being one of the most 
prominent issues within com-
munities, politics, the media 
and elsewhere, it’s understand-
able for someone like me to feel 
like they don’t “have the right” 
to enjoy rap. But music in gen-
eral is about the human experi-
ence — the joys and hardships 
we face and the emotions 
we feel resulting from these 
things. While it’s absolutely 
imperative to recognize and 
honor the cultural and histori-
cal background of music, lis-
tening to rap doesn’t have to be 
solely about race; it can also be 
about the shared experience of 
being human.

Now, I listen to Kendrick 

Lamar’s album with a new-
found sense of pleasure. My 
pain is not the same as his, 
but I can still feel the soul he’s 
poured into it.

TOP DAWG

I’ll pimp your butterfly.

My pain is not 
the same as his, 

but I can still 
feel his soul.

State Capitol, in Salt Lake City. 
Utah to use firing squads 
if lethal drugs unavailable 

Officials lay 

groundwork for 
security plans 

CAMP 
DAVID, 
Maryland 

(AP) — In a show of unity, U.S. 
and Afghan officials laid the 
groundwork for new relations 
between the two countries on 
Monday, including plans to seek 
American funding to maintain 
an Afghan security force of 
352,000 and long-term counter-
terrorism efforts. Discussions 
over future U.S. troop levels con-
tinue as the war winds down.

In an all-day session at the 

Camp David presidential retreat 
in Maryland’s Catoctin moun-
tains, dozens of U.S. and Afghan 
officials, including Secretary of 
State John Kerry, Defense Sec-
retary Ash Carter, Afghan Presi-
dent Ashraf Ghani and chief 

executive Abdullah Abdullah 
gathered to relaunch a relation-
ship strained by nearly 14-years 
of war and often-testy relations 
with former Afghan President 
Hamid Karzai.

During the meeting, the U.S. 

agreed to seek funding through 
2017 for an Afghan force of 
352,000, a level the nation has 
yet to meet, Carter said. U.S. 
officials said the Afghan gov-
ernment is trying to improve 
recruiting to make up for secu-
rity forces who leave the service.

They also agreed to require 

the Afghan government to com-
plete specific reforms and meet 
other milestones in order to 
receive up to $800 million. U.S. 
officials said the Afghans sug-
gested the incentive-based fund-
ing idea. The leaders of the two 
nations also said they would 
restart routine ministerial-level 
Defense and State Department 

meetings.

Ghani is to meet with Presi-

dent Barack Obama on Tuesday, 
an engagement during which 
officials expect the U.S. to make 
clear its decision to slow the pace 
of the withdrawal of American 
troops from Afghanistan. Ghani 
and Abdullah fought a conten-
tious election last year to replace 
Karzai, and their power-sharing 
agreement was lauded by Kerry, 
who played a key role in broker-
ing it.

“It is easy today to underesti-

mate the measure of courage and 
leadership and selflessness that 
was demanded at that moment, 
and that both of these leaders 
continue to show in their com-
mitment to a unity government,” 
Kerry said.

He added that “huge challeng-

es remain” but that the agree-
ments to be reached this week 
will help pave the way for stabil-

ity and security. Kerry said that 
the joint appearance at Camp 
David, along with the White 
House meetings, should serve 
as notice to the Taliban that the 
U.S.-Afghan relationship is back 
on track and they should negoti-
ate rather than fight.

“All of these underscore to any 

Taliban, to anybody who wants 
to engage in violence that we are 
prepared in the long term to sup-
port our friends in Afghanistan,” 
Kerry said.

Obama has promised to pull 

remaining U.S. troops out by the 
end of his presidency. But defi-
ciencies in the Afghan security 
forces, heavy casualties in the 
ranks of the Afghan army and 
police, a fragile new govern-
ment and fears that Islamic State 
fighters could gain a foothold 
in Afghanistan have combined 
to persuade Obama to slow the 
withdrawal.

Law could help 

overcome difficulty 

obtaining fatal 

injections 

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — 

Utah became the only state to 
allow firing squads for execu-
tions when Gov. Gary Herbert 
signed a law Monday approv-
ing the method for use when no 
lethal injection drugs are avail-
able, even though he has called it 
“a little bit gruesome.”

The Republican governor has 

said Utah is a capital punishment 
state and needs a backup execu-
tion method in case a shortage of 
the drugs persists.

“We regret anyone ever com-

mits the heinous crime of aggra-
vated murder to merit the death 
penalty, and we prefer to use 
our primary method of lethal 
injection when such a sentence 
is issued,” Herbert spokesman 
Marty Carpenter said. Howev-
er, enforcing death sentences is 
“the obligation of the executive 
branch.”

The governor’s office, in a 

statement announcing the new 
law, noted that other states 

allow 
execution 
methods 

other than lethal injection. In 
Washington state, inmates can 
request hanging. In New Hamp-
shire, hangings are fallback if 
lethal injections can’t be given. 
And an Oklahoma law would 
allow the state to use firing 
squads if lethal injections and 
electrocutions are ever declared 
unconstitutional.

Utah’s new approval of fir-

ing squads carries no such legal 
caveat and represents the lat-
est example of frustration over 
botched executions and the dif-
ficulty of obtaining lethal injec-
tion drugs as manufacturers 
opposed to capital punishment 
have made them off-limits to 
prisons.

The bill’s sponsor, Republi-

can Rep. Paul Ray of Clearfield, 
argued that a team of trained 
marksmen is faster and more 
decent 
than 
the 
drawn-out 

deaths involved when lethal 
injections go awry — or even if 
they go as planned.

Though Utah’s next execution 

is probably a few years away, Ray 
said wants to settle on a backup 
method now so authorities are 
not racing to find a solution if 
the drug shortage drags on. Ray 
didn’t return messages seeking 

comment Monday.

Opponents of the measure 

say firing squads are barbaric, 
with the American Civil Liber-
ties Union of Utah saying the bill 
makes the state “look backward 
and backwoods.”

Utah 
lawmakers 
stopped 

offering inmates the choice of 
firing squad in 2004, saying the 
method attracted intense media 
interest and took attention away 
from victims.

Utah is the only state in the 

past 40 years to carry out such a 
death sentence, with three exe-
cutions by firing squad since the 
U.S. Supreme Court reinstated 
the death penalty in 1976.

The last was in 2010, when 

Ronnie Lee Gardner was put to 
death by five police officers with 
.30-caliber Winchester rifles in 
an event that generated interna-
tional interest and elicited con-
demnation from many.

Gardner killed a bartender 

and later shot a lawyer to death 
and wounded a bailiff during a 
1985 courthouse escape attempt.

The bailiff’s widow, VelDean 

Kirk, who witnessed Gardner’s 
execution, said she supports the 
new law. “I don’t think it’s bar-
baric,” she said. “I think that’s 
the best way to do it.”

Netanyahu addresses 
remarks made during 
last week’s election 

JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime 

Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
apologized to Israel’s Arab citi-
zens on Monday for remarks he 
made during last week’s parlia-
ment election that offended mem-
bers of the community.

The move appeared to be an 

attempt to heal rifts and mute 
criticism at home and in the 
United States. Netanyahu drew 
accusations of racism in Israel, 
especially from its Arab minority, 
and a White House rebuke when, 
just a few hours before polling 
stations were to close across the 
country, he warned that Arab citi-
zens were voting “in droves.”

But 
President 
Barack 

Obama’s chief of staff, Denis 
McDonough, rejected Netanya-
hu’s attempt to distance himself 
from his comments, telling an 
Israel advocacy group Monday 
that the U.S. can’t just overlook 
what Netanyahu said on the eve 
of his re-election.

Netanyahu, whose Likud Party 

won re-election in the vote, met 
with members of the Arab com-
munity at the prime minister’s 
residence in Jerusalem on Mon-
day and apologized.

He said he knows his “com-

ments last week offended some 
Israeli citizens and offended 
members of the Israeli-Arab com-
munity.”

“This was never my intent. I 

apologize for this,” Netanyahu 
said. “I view myself as the prime 
minister of each and every citizen 
of Israel, without any prejudice 
based on religion, ethnicity or 
gender.”

“I view all Israeli citizens as 

partners in the building of a pros-

perous and safe state of Israel, for 
all Israelis,” he also said.

A recently established alliance 

of four small, mostly Arab parties 
called the Joint List made unprec-
edented gains in the March 17 
election, earning enough votes to 
make it the third-largest party in 
Israel’s parliament. Arab citizens 
make up 20 percent of Israel’s pop-
ulation. Equality is guaranteed in 
Israel’s laws but many Arabs have 
long complained of discrimina-
tion, mainly in the job and hous-
ing market.

Ayman Odeh, the head of the 

Joint List, told channel 2 TV that 
Netanyahu’s apology was not 
accepted.

“This is not a real apology,” 

Odeh said. “He incited against cit-
izens who were exercising their 
basic right to vote for Knesset.”

Odeh also accused Netan-

yahu of “zigzagging” by saying 
one thing one day and a different 
another.

In the final days of the cam-

paign, Netanyahu angered the 
U.S. by taking a tough stance 
toward the Palestinians and by 
saying a Palestinian state will not 
be established on his watch in the 
current climate of regional chaos 
and violence. Resolving the con-
flict between Israel and the Pales-
tinians in a two state solution is a 
key U.S. foreign policy priority.

In his speech to J Street, an 

Israel advocacy group that is 
sharply critical of Netanyahu, 
McDonough 
warned 
Israel 

against annexing the West Bank, 
where Palestinians hope to estab-
lish their future state. He said 
Netanyahu’s prediction that a 
Palestinian state wouldn’t come 
about on his watch was “very 
troubling” and questioned Netan-
yahu’s broader commitment to 
the two-state solution the U.S. 
and Israel have officially support-
ed for years.

The Greek goddess of 
walks, Sierra Romero

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

Many baseball fans refer to 

former Red Sox infielder Kevin 
Youkilis as the “Greek God of 
Walks.” 
Michigan 
softball’s 

Sierra Romero is challenging 
him for that title. The junior 
second 
baseman 
has 
been 

walked 38 times this season, the 
third highest in college softball.

In 
a 
three-game 
series 

against Ohio State, the fourth-
ranked Wolverines (3-0 Big 
Ten, 28-4 overall) swept the 
Buckeyes, scoring a total of 46 
runs and giving up just two. In 
the first two games, Romero 
recorded six runs batted in. 
In the final game, she didn’t 
record even one.

Romero’s lack of RBI on 

Sunday was not the result of a 
poor individual performance 
but 
a 
change 
of 
strategy 

from Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins.

After 12 Michigan batters 

were walked on Saturday, three 
of which eventually reached 
home plate, Hutchins took 
note and thought of a beneficial 
adjustment.

Sunday, Romero moved up to 

the leadoff spot in the batting 
order, away from her usual 

position as the third in line. In 
that game, Romero was walked 
three of the four times she came 
to the plate, and she made it 
around the bases each time she 
was walked.

“We did a great job of taking a 

lot of free bases,” said Michigan 
coach 
Carol 
Hutchins. 
“In 

(Saturday’s) game we got 12 
walks, and we made them 
pay for it. When we did strike 
the ball, we struck it really 
well, but the key was getting 
baserunners.”

When it comes to on-base 

percentage, Romero boasts a 
hefty .699, which ranks second 
in the country.

Romero’s 
high 
on-base 

percentage is largely a result 
of how often she gets walked. 
Romero’s 
dangerous 
power 

hitting merits the number of 
intentional walks she receives. 
When she is at bat, Romero 
expects to get on base, and 
this is a big reason why she 
is considered one of the best 
players in country.

Since Romero gets on base 

so much, it only made sense 
to bring her to the top of the 
order. Michigan has plenty of 
other the sluggers to hit her 
around the bases, but if no one 
is on base beforehand, there 

are fewer runs to be scored. 
Behind Romero in the batting 
order were sophomore Kelly 
Christner and junior Sierra 
Lawrence. Both follow right 
behind 
Romero 
in 
on-base 

percentages, holding a .504 and 
a .476, respectively.

But Romero sticks out. She 

has shown there is more to 
offense than just hitting home 
runs, something she can do 
with ease. Instead, Romero’s 
stat sheet demonstrates the 
importance of getting on base.

In her career, Romero has 

been walked a total of 153 times, 
the third highest in Michigan 
softball history. By end of her 
senior year, the record will 
likely belong to her.

Kevin Youkilis’ 104 walks 

in 2003 were the among the 
highest in the minor leagues. 
Former Oakland A’s manager 
Billy Beane hired him for just 
that. As a three time All-Star 
and two-time World Series 
champion, Youkilis made a 
nine-year career out of getting 
walked. Romero is already 
doing the same.

Note: Michigan’s Tuesday 

game 
against 
Western 

Michigan has been rescheduled 
to Wednesday at 4:00 p.m. at 
Alumni Field.

Wolverines prepare for 
Falcons in home opener 

By BEN FIDELMAN 

Daily Sports Writer

After spending its first 22 

games on the road, the Michi-
gan baseball team opens its 
home schedule against Bowling 
Green on Tuesday at Ray Fisher 
Stadium.

The 
team 

will not only 
be happy to 
see its home 
turf in game 
action for the 
first time this 
season, 
but 

also 
to 
play 

sub-.500 com-
petition after 
being swept at 
Nebraska last 
weekend.

The Falcons 

(0-3 MAC, 5-13 
overall) come into Ann Arbor 
riding a seven-game losing 
streak, most recently includ-
ing a sweep at the hands of 
Ball State in which they were 
outscored by a combined 18-3 
margin. Though the offense 
has recently struggled to score 
runs, two Bowling Green start-
ers have batting averages above 
.300: catcher Trey Keegan and 
infielder Greg Basalyga.

Heading to the mound for 

the Falcons is left-hander Brett 
Fitzwater, who has been one 
of the team’s most consistent 
pitchers this season. Carrying 
a 3.65 earned-run average, the 
junior has held opponents to a 
.229 batting average so far this 
season.

The Wolverines (0-3 Big Ten, 

11-11 overall) will counter with 
right-hander Matt Ogden. Com-
ing back from an injury that 
cost him the entire 2014 season, 
the redshirt junior has posted a 
5.14 ERA through seven innings 
pitched this year. Tuesday will 
be his first start of the season.

Though 
the 
scoreboard 

didn’t end up looking like what 
the team wanted, Michigan had 
a few bright spots against the 

Cornhuskers. Three Wolver-
ines hit over .350 on the week-
end, including senior outfielder 
Jackson Glines, who went 6-for-
13. His season average now sits 
at a Big Ten-best .472 — nearly 
70 points higher than any other 
player in the conference.

In addition to Glines, junior 

left fielder Cody Bruder, right 
fielder Carmen Benedetti and 
first baseman Jacob Cronen-
worth are having respectable 
seasons.

Benedetti and Bruder rank 

in the top six Big Ten players 
in runs batted in, with 22 and 
20, respectively. Nearly half of 
Benedetti’s 22 RBI were record-
ed in one day, when he slugged 
in 10 runs in a doubleheader 
against Toledo and Coastal Car-
olina on March 7. Benedetti also 
ranks third in the conference 
with eight doubles.

While it comes as no shock to 

anyone who watched the team 
last year, Cronenworth con-
tinues to get on base and score 
runs better than many others. 

Last season, he finished sec-
ond in the conference in walks, 
accompanied with a 10th-place 
finish in runs scored. He seems 
to be on a similar trajectory 
this year, as he currently sits at 
second in walks and is tied for 
third in runs scored among all 
Big Ten players.

Glines, Cronenworth, Bene-

detti and Bruder are joined by 
senior shortstop Eric Jacobson 
to make up the five Michigan 
players with batting averages 
above .300 this season.

Michigan is looking to right 

the ship in this midweek game 
before facing off against No. 20 
Maryland this weekend. This is 
the second year in a row that the 
Wolverines have started the Big 
Ten season against two of the 
best teams in the conference, 
and they learned last year how 
important it was to sustain good 
momentum in weekday games 
between those major series. The 
team lost just three midweek 
games once opening its home 
schedule last year.

‘M’ advances in WNIT

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Writer

TOLEDO, Ohio — As the 

buzzer sounded to signal the 
end of regulation, Michigan 
women’s basketball coach Kim 
Barnes 
Arico’s 
children 
charged 
through 
the 
stands 
to 

congratulate their mom after a 
huge 74-58 win over Toledo.

But just as they reached the 

court, an usher stopped them, 
not knowing exactly who the 
kids were. Barnes Arico had 
to signal to the usher to let 
them through so she could 
experience the joyous moment 
she deserved after leading her 
team to the WNIT round of 16.

“(The usher) didn’t know 

who they were, so I had to tell 
him,” Barnes Arico said. “They 
had to get home to get to bed, so 
I didn’t want them to hang out 
(too long).

“They are at the age now 

that they know what’s going on. 
When we lose, they cry. When 
they win, they’re so excited.” 

And for a moment, it seemed 

as if Barnes Arico’s kids would 
be crying after the game. 

Five minutes into Michigan’s 

second-round WNIT matchup 
with 
Toledo, 
backed 
by 
a 

raucous 
crowd 
at 
Savage 

Arena, the Rockets made their 
first three shots, while the 
Wolverines shot just 1-for-5 to 
start the game. 

It seemed like it would 

be another rough night for 
Michigan away from Crisler 
Center.

But things were different 

this time, and freshman guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty 
was 
the 

player to ignite the Wolverines 
on Monday night to bring them 
into the WNIT round of 16.

With 5:07 left in the first 

half and senior forward Cyesha 

Goree off the floor due to foul 
trouble, Flaherty drove inside 
and put up a shot through of 
forest of bodies. The layup went 
in, and the once-rocking crowd 
at Savage Arena was silenced. 

Flaherty’s 
3-point 
play 

ignited the Wolverines to a 16-0 
run to end the half — all without 
Goree, their leading scorer, on 
the floor. 

“At the beginning of the 

year, if Cyesha picked up her 
second foul and (senior guard 
Shannon Smith) picked up her 
second foul, or any two of our 
seniors, we would’ve thought 
to be in serious trouble,” Barnes 
Arico said. “To finish that 
first half with two freshmen, 
a sophomore, a junior and a 
senior on the floor during a 16-0 
run got me super excited.”

Flaherty led Michigan with 

25 points, while sophomore 
guard Siera Thompson, despite 
not starting for the second 
game in row, scored 20 points. 

“It was nice to see Katelynn 

and Siera knock down some 
shots,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 

“They’ve been kind of a streaky 
lately, so it was great to see 
them have an incredible night.”

The Wolverines picked up 

right where they left off in 
the second half, shooting 40 
percent and outscoring the 
Rockets by two. 

And when Goree picked up 

her third foul with 12:52 left 
in the game, it was freshman 
forward Jillian Dunston who 
came up big for the Wolverines. 
Just like in the first half when 
Goree left the game, Dunston’s 
physical 
presence 
inside 

was enough to throw off the 
Rockets. 

“In practice, we work on 

getting younger players, like 
Jillian, ready so she can step 
in at big times like tonight,” 
Thompson said. “I think she 
played very well tonight.”

But with the crowd on 

Toledo’s 
side, 
the 
Rockets 

never seemed like they were 
completely out of the game. 
Midway through the second 
half, Toledo went on a 7-0 run 
to cut the lead to 10. But that 
was as close as the Rockets got. 
Once again, it was Flaherty 
who sank three straight shots 
to widen the gap. 

While Toledo put up a good 

fight, it wasn’t meant to be for 
a team ranked 59 spots behind 
Michigan in the RPI. 

Rockets 
guard 
Inma 

Zanoguera — Toledo’s lead-
ing scorer — finished with 14 
points, while guard Brenae 
Harris, who played for Michi-
gan between 2011 and 2013, fin-
ished with 11. 

The Wolverines now move on 

to play Missouri in the round of 
16 at home on Thursday. 

But considering its road woes 

this season, Michigan will cel-
ebrate its victory, at least until 
tomorrow’s practice. 

“It’s a great feeling (to win),” 

Thompson said. “We’re not 
done though. We want to keep 
working and keep winning.”

Freshman guard Katelynn Flaherty scored 25 points off the bench in Michigan’s second-round WNIT victory.

MICHIGAN
TOLEDO

Flaherty, Thompson star

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

TOLEDO, 
Ohio 
— 
After 

an 
unceremonious 
WNIT 

opener that saw the Michigan 
women’s basketball team shoot 
a combined 6-for-18 from the 
field in a win over Cleveland 
State, freshman guard Katelynn 
Flaherty and sophomore guard 
Siera Thompson got to work.

They, along with the other 

Wolverine guards, went in to 
take extra shots on their day 
off Friday with assistant coach 
Megan Duffy.

And in the Wolverines’ 74-58 

win over Toledo at Savage Arena 
on Friday, it showed, as the two 
combined to shoot an almost 
nonsensical 17-for-23 from the 
floor, lifting Michigan into the 
tournament’s third round.

“My last game, I think I shot 

3-for-11,” Flaherty said. “Getting 
the ball back in our hands 
when we’re not having a good 
shooting day really gives us 
confidence.”

Neither 
Thompson 
nor 

Flaherty 
started 
Monday 

for the Wolverines, but they 
made 
the 
difference 
in 
a 

hostile environment. Without 
Thompson 
and 
Flaherty’s 

astounding 74-percent shooting, 
the Wolverines’ line would have 
been 9-for-30.

And while both players are 

undoubtedly deep threats every 
night, Monday’s outburst was still 
somewhat unexpected. While 
Flaherty started the season as one 
of the team’s premier shooters, 
she has struggled to get her shot 
going in her last three games.

“Katelynn is funny — she’s 

still such a youngster that 
so much of her game is still 
predicated on the first shot, or 
the second shot,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “If 
she’s 0-for-1 or 0-for-2 I start 
to get nervous, because I think 
she hesitates instead of taking 
threes. But tonight she got the 
first one to fall, and then her 
confidence was flowing.”

But Flaherty didn’t just get the 

first one to fall Monday. She got 
the first eight. In fact, she didn’t 
miss a shot until there was just 
11:29 remaining, and that was 

on a blocked layup by Toledo’s 
Sophie Reecher.

She racked up 25 points from 

just about everywhere on the 
court, mostly on 3-pointers and a 
series of long 2s, neither of which 
the Rockets could do anything 
about.

Even when they closed out on 

her, Flaherty’s release was still 
too quick.

“We just couldn’t get a hand 

her face fast enough,” lamented 
Toledo coach Tricia Cullop.

Added Thompson: “(Flaherty) 

was great tonight. I’ve seen her 
like that a lot of times, but she was 
very, very good tonight.”

Even if the Rockets had 

found an answer for Flaherty, 
Thompson might have been 
able to carry Michigan herself. 
She shot a perfect 4-for-4 from 
behind the arc, finishing with 16 
points.

She continuously found ways 

to get open and make Toledo pay 
for the holes in its defense.

“To (Thompson)’s credit, she’s 

been out of the starting lineup 
the last two games, and that’s 
probably the only time in career 
she’s been out of the starting 
lineup,” Barnes Arico said. “She 
responded tonight, and that was 
awesome to see.”

For one stretch in the second 

half, Flaherty and Thompson 
were the Wolverines’ entire 
offense. After Flaherty hit a 
3-pointer to put Michigan up 
46-30 with 15:16 to play, no player 
not named Thompson or Flaherty 
scored for the Wolverines until 
senior forward Nicole Elmblad 
hit a free throw with 2:46 
remaining.

Luckily for Michigan, that was 

still more than enough scoring. 
They totaled 17 points in that 
span, more than enough to stave 
off a brief push from Toledo.

“They just kind of lost us with 

all our screens,” Flaherty said. “I 
know my team needs me to shoot 
— it’s one of the best things I do.”
