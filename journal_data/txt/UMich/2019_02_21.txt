talks future of autonomous 
 
vehicles in state of Michigan 

Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II toured 
the University of Michigan’s driver-
less car test and research site, Mcity, 
Wednesday afternoon. The visit 
was part of Gov. Gretchen Whit-
mer’s “Home for Opportunity” tour, 
a series of 50 events intended to 
highlight avenues for technological 
innovation, infrastructural devel-
opment and economic opportunity 
in the state of Michigan.
Mcity Deputy Director Carrie 
Morton started the event with a 
presentation on Mcity’s research 
and partnerships as well as the 
future of autonomous vehicles. She 
noted Mcity is currently focusing 
on small-scale, local deployments 
of autonomous vehicles, such as the 
driverless shuttles in Detroit.
“We’re going to see this increas-
ing level for deployment, where they 
can drive themselves in a very small 
area, similar to the May Mobility 
shuttles in Detroit,” Morton said. 
“We’ll see these in small deploy-
ments, but make no mistake, at this 
stage, all of those are pretty highly 
curated science projects and 
they’re not ready to scale and 
they won’t be for some time.”

This Wednesday, the Climate 
Action 
Movement 
at 
the 
University of Michigan hosted 
an event focused on building 
the climate change movement 
on 
campus. 
Held 
in 
the 
Annenberg Auditorium at the 
Gerald R. Ford School of Public 
Policy, the event attracted 
about 100 students, faculty and 
community members.
The event began with four 
panelists discussing the most 
pressing 
issues 
concerning 
climate change and how to 
address them, followed by a 
small group breakout session in 
which students brainstormed 
their own ideas about the 

issues and finished with a large 
group discussion.
Engineering junior Logan 
Vear, president of the Climate 
Action 
Movement 
at 
the 
University of Michigan, started 
off the event by explaining the 
goal of bringing community 
members together to figure out 
how best to address climate 
issues and make a change in 
the University and larger Ann 
Arbor community.
“Although we do not have the 
power to change things at the 
global level, taking action and 
influencing change at the local 
level is just as important, 
if not even more so,” Vear 
said.

Resolution passes in favor of allowing final semester to be taken pass/fail

LIAT WEINSTEIN
Daily Staff Reporter

LSA Student Government 
convened for their weekly 
meeting Wednesday evening 
in Mason Hall to discuss the 
LSA 
language 
requirement 
policy and fixing faulty MCard 
readers in residence halls.

LSA SG passed a resolution 
26 to 0 in favor of allowing 
the last semester of the lan-
guage requirement to be taken 
pass/fail. LSA juniors Gabbie 
Ammond, Wyatt Puscas, Jon 
Reid and Jordan Schuler and 
LSA senior Hanna Simmons 
sponsored the resolution and 
discussed concerns many stu-

dents 
taking 
language 
courses may have about their 
GPAs in language courses.
Currently, 
students 
are 
required to take four semes-
ters of one language in order 
to complete LSA’s language 
requirement. Prior to LSA SG’s 
vote on Wednesday, the first 
three courses in the sequence 

could be taken pass/fail, but 
the last course had to be taken 
for a grade. Since the language 
requirement went into effect, 
students have voiced concerns 
over the large time commit-
ment required to finish all 
four courses of the sequence.

KEEMYA ESMAEL/Daily
LSA Student Government meets to discuss the LSA foreign language requirement in Mason Hall Wednesday evening.

On 
Wednesday 
night, 
about 100 students attended 
the 
Yemeni 
Students’ 
Association’s event “Crisis, 
Commitment, 
and 
Coffee: 
A Yemeni American Story.” 
The event featured Ibrahim 
Alhasbani, 
a 
Yemeni 
Immigrant and the founder 
of Qahwah House, a coffee 
shop in Dearborn, Michigan. 
Qahwah House aims to teach 
their customers about the 
struggles 
of 
those 
living 
in Yemen, where the shop 
sources their coffee.
Alhasbani 
began 
his 
presentation by describing 
Yemen’s 
historical 

connection to coffee. He also 
explained the origins of the 
coffee shop’s name. Qahwah 
translates 
to 
“coffee” 
in 
English.
“Yemen is the birthplace 
for coffee,” Alhasbani said. 
“That’s why Yemen’s coffee 
is the most important coffee 
in the world … I remind 
everyone, coffee comes from 
where? It comes from Yemen.”

On Wednesday night, about 100 
students and faculty gathered in 
the Annenberg Auditorium for a 
panel to discuss the human rights 
violations in North Korea and the 
role of American foreign policy in 
such conversations. The panel was 
hosted by the Donia Human Rights 
Center, in partnership with the 
Ford School of Public Policy, Inter-
national Policy Center, Law School 
and the Nam Center for Korean 
Studies.
The panel took place amidst 
recent negotiations
of 
denuclearization 
between 
the United States and North Korea 
while humanitarian crimes contin-

ue to occur under the Kim Jong-un 
regime.
Business sophomore Richa Shah 
explained why she came to the 
panel and expressed her desire to 
partake in the broader conversa-
tion.
“Dialogue can often be ineffec-
tive but if communities go about 
it in a strategic way with tangible 
plans, I think it will help,” Sacha 
said.
The panel opened with Jared 
Genser, a legal expert with pro-
bono experience in the North 
Korean humanitarian crisis. He 
explained the progress the inter-
national community has made 
with resolutions adopted by both 
the United Nations Human Rights 
Council and the General Assembly 

of the United Nations to focus on 
the rights of North Korean citizens 
under Kim’s dictatorship.
“While we have done a lot of 
report writing, public speaking 
issuing, and combinations of the 
two, really nothing has been put in 
major effect regarding the situation 
in North Korea,” Genser said.
According to Genser, the human-
itarian rights of the North Korean 
people are often pushed to the back 
burner by many policymakers who 
focus solely on denuclearization. 
Citing the Responsibility to Protect 
doctrine adopted by the UN World 
Summit in 2005 that obligates 
states to protect populations from 
crimes against humanity, Genser 
emphasized the necessity of bring-
ing to light the human rights issue 

in North Korea. He noted the fam-
ine, lack of basic food policies in 
North Korea and the Gulag concen-
tration camps as some of the many 
problems that North Korean citi-
zens face on a daily basis.
“The international community 
has a responsibility to help and 
engage in these human rights viola-
tions in North Korea,” Genser said. 
“But the reality is that the world 
focuses almost exclusively on North 
Korea’s nuclear and missile pro-
grams. And the security establish-
ment in the United States, such as 
the defense department or intel-
ligence agencies, really make the 
ability to engage in North Kore-
an human rights much more lim-
ited than you would expect.”

This Wednesday, the Climate 
Action Movement at the Univer-
sity of Michigan hosted an event 
focused on building the climate 
change movement on campus. 
Held in the Annenberg Auditori-
um at the Gerald R. Ford School 
of Public Policy, the event at-
tracted about 100 students, fac-
ulty and community members.
The event began with four 
panelists discussing the most 

pressing issues concerning cli-
mate change and how to address 
them, followed by a small group 
breakout session in which stu-
dents brainstormed their own 
ideas about the issues and fin-
ished with a large group discus-
sion.
Engineering 
junior 
Logan 
Vear, president of the Climate 
Action Movement at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, started off the 
event by explaining the goal of 
bringing community members 
together to figure out how best 
to address climate issues and 

make a change in the University 
and larger Ann Arbor commu-
nity.
“Although we do not have the 
power to change things at the 
global level, taking action and 
influencing change at the local 
level is just as important, if not 
even more so,” Vear said. “Many 
people and individuals within 
our communities, such as you 
all, have already been actively 
working to make sustainable 
changes, but we can’t do this 
alone. We have to come togeth-
er, and that’s exactly what this is 
today.”
The panelists who spoke at 
the event were Adam Simon, 
professor of earth and environ-
mental sciences at the Univer-
sity; Joshua MacDonald, ener-
gy coordinator for Ann Arbor; 
Dominic 
Bednar, 
third-year 
PhD student in Environment 
and Sustainability and Rack-
ham student Fern MacDougal, 
who studies conservation en-
ergy.
The panel responded to 
questions about what chal-
lenges hinder the University’s 
progress when it comes to 
fighting climate change and 
what steps students and com-
munity members might take 
to tackle them. Adam Simon, 
professor of earth and environ-
mental sciences at the Univer-
sity highlighted faculty mem-
bers’ lack of acknowledgment 
of the magnitude and complex-
ity of the issues concerning 
climate change we face as a 
major obstacle to progress. He 
emphasized the importance of 
seeking help in improving sus-
tainability initiatives.
“I think if we were willing 

to accept that we don’t have to 
know everything nor can we, 
then we would make progress at 
a much faster right,” Simon said.
Dominic Bednar, third-year 
PhD student in Environment 
and Sustainability emphasized 
the importance of emphasiz-
ing diversity within the climate 
change movement.
“Climate change dispropor-
tionately affects low income 
people of color, so how do we 
weave those people into the 
conversation to, again, help us 
understand,” Bednar said. “We 
don’t necessarily have all the 
answers, but when you put a di-
verse group of people together 
you’re able to innovate much 
more rapidly.”
Simon also proposed that 
the multitude of clubs on cam-
pus focused on climate change 
should come together to ensure 
their collective impact is lasting.
“Your time on campus is fi-
nite,” Simon said. “You are here, 
you are loud, you’re gonna leave. 
And you have to make sure when 
you’re gone the next group of 
students is going to be as loud as 
you are.”
Following the panel, attend-
ees split into small groups to 
discuss the ideas put forth by 
the panelists. A list of prompts 
were projected on the front of 
the room, encouraging attend-
ees to brianstorm the best ways 
to take action.
Students also shared what 
brought them to the event. LSA 
sophomore Aviva Nemeth said 
she wanted to learn how to do 
more to fight climate change.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Clad in a denim-on-denim 
ensemble, a girl walks down the 
bustling streets of Ann Arbor. 
She’s wearing earphones and 
the clash of drums in Nirvana’s 
“Smells Like Teen Spirit” seems 
to eradicate the chaos that 
surrounds her. Her getup is 
anything but form-fitting. The 
oversized jean jacket and the 
Adidas sneakers create a unisex 
style while her accent braids 
keep the look feminine. There 
is nothing flashy about her, 
yet people can’t help but stare 
because this isn’t the ’90s. This 
took place yesterday.
I could roll my eyes at the 
scene and comment on how 
hard the girl is trying to seem 
“grunge,” 
but 
I’ve 
already 
drank the Kool Aid. Bootcut 
jeans and “dad jeans” are back 
in stores such as Lucky and The 
Gap, and jean jackets have had 
a full-on resurgence among the 
Generation Z kids that missed 
their last heyday. Stan Smiths, 
vintage Adidas, New Balance 
and Nike sneakers have taken 
the streets by storm. Denim-on-
denim is acceptable once again. 
Multiple hoops adorn women’s 
ears, turtlenecks have become 
the 
standard 
sweater 
and 
flannel shirts are inescapable. 
Many would label these style 
choices as the epitome of “white 
’90s dad” attire, so why would 
young people be championing 
them?

The answer involves both 
psychology 
and 
stylistic 
choices. The style is called 
Normcore, a hybrid of “normal” 
and “hardcore.” The New 
York Times has defined it as 
“a fashion movement in which 
scruffy young urbanites swear 
off the tired street-style clichés 
of the last decade — skinny 
jeans, wallet chains, flannel 
shirts — in favor of a less-ironic 
embrace of bland, suburban 
anti-fashion attire.” Normcore 
is a unisex style that works 
hard to embody “normal” and 
“simple” through unpretentious 
clothing and basic colors. There 
are no blouses or neckties. 
There are no complex patterns 
or tight fits. It’s not meant to 
stand out, and the biggest brand 
these urbanites shop is The 
Gap.
Fashion trends are often 
driven 
by 
young 
people 
choosing new ways to express 
themselves, 
and 
often 
the 
sentiment is a rejection of 
what was there before. The 
cynics among us will blame the 
market economy and say that 
trends keep the retail sector 
humming and second hand 
stores flush with new cast-offs. 
With Normcore, I choose to 
see something less cynical in 
fashion trends. I see something 
more creative: A generation 
slowly moving into the world 
of our parents claiming its 
independence and asserting its 
perspective.
But why embrace the styles 
of what many considered one of 

the blandest eras in the history 
of fashion? I don’t think it’s a 
coincidence that the ’90s was 
arguably one of the most stable 
and uncontroversial decades 
in modern US history, a clear 
contrast to the political and 
social volatility that our society 
finds itself in today. I also don’t 
think it’s a coincidence that 
many young trendsetters are 
striving for a generic aesthetic, 
rather 
than 
name-brand 
and highly stylized trends. 
I can’t help but see parallels 
to a rejection of the lines of 
demarcation that have recently 
marked our national landscape. 
The euphoria of being part of a 
group is gone.
The key trendsetters here 
are millennials, a group often 
maligned for feeling entitled. 
Alternatively, millennials can 
be seen as individualists who 
feel they have the power to 
make change when they see 
that their society is not living 
up to its potential. They’ve 
been developing platforms to 
express 
themselves 
through 
social media, and this is simply 
another platform. In this way, 
Normcore should not be viewed 
as another eye-rolling attempt 
by many of us to show that 
we’re “retro,” but that we are, 
in fact, proactive.
Of 
course, 
my 
armchair 
psychological analysis may not 
apply to all — maybe people 
just really liked the outfit that 
Elaine wore in that “Seinfeld” 
episode 
they 
binge-watched 
last night.

“New House”

Rex Orange County

Lakeshore Records

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘NEW HOUSE’

At its root, a suburban 
house 
is 
known 
as 
a 
residential accommodation. 
The 
undercurrents 
of 
a 
suburban 
house 
are 
plentiful, with connotations 
of what is a domicile and 
ordinary. 
Moreover, 
a 
suburban house is perhaps 
“what came before,” as in 
what came before fame, 
or what came before a big 
move to LA or NYC.
Rex 
Orange 
County 
interrogates this suburban 
space as an entity he 
wishes to recreate in his 
single “New House.” The 
homespun 
familiarity 
of picking out décor is 
the exact, genuine space 
of 
groundedness 
that 
he seemingly feels went 
missing since striking fame. 
The release of “New House,” 
and Rex’s subsequent tweet 
stating his gratefulness for 
his career, elaborates on his 
difficulty in achieving fame, 
and successively struggling 
to find a honesty to which he 
has a substantial connection. 
 

By releasing “New House” 
on 
Valentine’s 
Day, 
Rex 
reminds us that love is not 
about 
dinner 
dates, 
but 
rather 
about 
recognizing 
the people in your life who 
build up a house around 

you and ground you. “New 
House” elaborates on an 
apparent lack of inspiration 
to impress, with lyrics like 
“Every time I try, it never 
feels the way it did at the 
start.” “New House” is Rex’s 
plea to strip to the basics, 
away from the nepotism and 

consistent hype of the music 
industry.
Rex himself has always 
served as a suburban house 
to his fans. He’s a staple of 
ordinary and attainable, but 
certainly not in a colorless 
manner. The authenticity of 
his simple striped tee and 
jeans at every performance, 
and 
his 
unpretentious 
themes of coming of age 
woes 
(self-deprecation, 
depression, youthful love) 
come 
naturally. 
“New 
House” yearns for a territory 
of authenticity from which 
the suburban house cover 
art and symbolism is born.
Rex offers an intimate 
and 
important 
reminder 
for Valentine’s Day: The 
importance of facilitating 
and creating spaces where 
our loved ones feel grounded 
and real.

B-SIDE: STYLE

Music today isn’t physical like 
it used to be. Gone are the days 
when every release demanded 
a walk down to the record 
store or even to Target for the 
newest Taylor Swift CD, gone 
are the collections that take up 
whole walls in living rooms or 
scatter themselves across the 
floor in precarious towers. No 
one is handing out mixtapes 
that you can turn over in your 
hand, a little thoughtful gift for 
a friend or a potential romantic 
interest. Instead, today’s music 
is 
becoming 
increasingly 
more abstract in the wake of 
streaming services and has been 
since the birth of software like 
iTunes and Napster.
Music is in the airwaves, 
online 
— 
everywhere. 
We 
have millions of songs at our 
fingertips, but they’re never 
quite tangible. This makes it 
hard to pass down the tunes 
that make us us to those who 
matter. You can send someone a 
Spotify playlist, but can they find 
it when they dig through their 
college 
mementos? 
Probably 
not. In this way, the songs that 
soundtrack our lives are much 
less tokens to be collected, 
and more ephemeral in nature 
than they’ve ever been before. 
Because of that, more and more 
people are returning to the 
physical in fear of losing that 
kinetic connection to music, 
including me.
The summer before I came 
to college, the record player 
that I had bought on a whim 
during sophomore year finally 
reintegrated into my life. The 

needle was broken, sure, but 
finding the orange turntable and 
my family’s old TV speakers gave 
me a project for once that could 
potentially turn into something 
great. 
I 
hooked 
everything 
up in my room, (including a 
subwoofer, 
to 
my 
mother’s 
chagrin), and there it was — a 
true old-fashioned record setup 
ready to play anything I wanted. 
The problem was, of course, that 
I had no actual records. The only 
obvious choice was to steal them 
from my father.
And so I ventured deep into 
the cluttered basement at his 
house, with the blessing that I 
could take anything that wasn’t 
either incredibly valuable or 
literally his own music that had 
been released in the ’80s. Don’t 
worry about those, I assured 
him, I could hear that for free 
when he practiced in our living 
room, sounding through the 
house with a deep baritone buzz. 
What I was really looking for was 
everything else; the music that 
had soundtracked my childhood, 
the James Taylors and Joni 
Mitchells and Tom Pettys of my 
past. In that basement, I found 
these and even more records 
that I could call mine, though 
they were technically his. And 
in that handover of the music 
we both shared, I discovered a 
very particular kind of nostalgia, 
hidden in the grooves of each 
well-played pressing.
I threw them all into a 
shopping bag and lugged the 
weight of 30 records to my 
mother’s 
house, 
where 
the 
newly-connected sound system 
waited. They looked nice on 
my shelf, a dingy rainbow of 
everything from Suzanne Vega 
to Talking Heads. He even had a 

pressing of Prince’s 1999, a funny 
connection to my birth year even 
when the album came out in 
1982. I sunk into my bed and let 
the music ring out in the summer 
afternoon, laughing when I came 
upon a song that had been played 
so much it skipped. I realized 
that my father and I liked the 
same tunes 40 years apart, as 
“The Boy in the Bubble” by Paul 
Simon and “The Boho Dance” by 
Joni Mitchell refused to finish 
without the needle wobbling 
into another track. It made me 
smile, and appreciate the things 
that these physical versions of 
music could tell me that just 
listening to the songs couldn’t: 
With every record I felt heavy 
in my hands as I put it on the 
turntable, I could feel the weight 
of my father’s love for each song, 
entangled with my own so many 
years down the line.
They echoed into my room 
and I closed my eyes, finally 
understanding why people loved 
vinyl so much. Sure, it is pretty, 
and a symbol of the old-soul 
mentality many hipsters boast 
today, but there’s more to it than 
that. Sitting on my bed in the 
July sun, I imagined my father 
listening to the same records 
after buying them from the 
store new, in his dorm room, in 
a friend’s apartment, in his first 
house. There was something 
comforting about that image, 
something that I didn’t feel 
just hearing the songs in my 
headphones. But the thing that 
really got me was the fact that 
the songs I had stolen from my 
dad’s basement weren’t only just 
noise, they were wrapped up in 
memory too, sentiment that had 
the same place in each record 
that the music did.

Vinyl, talisman to the past

B-SIDE: MUSIC

CLARA SCOTT
Senior Arts Editor

You’re sitting on a bench 
swinging your legs that hang 
several inches from the ground, 
leaning your weight on your 
left hand as your right hand 
holds a Strawberry Shortcake 
Bar. Although your hands have 
picked up all sorts of dirt from 
the asphalt, the sandbox and the 
public bench you now sit on, this 
doesn’t prevent you from licking 
the quickly-melting vanilla ice 
cream that flows from the bar 
off of your fingers. Your skin 
is already sticky anyway from 
hours-old sunscreen and sweat.
The sun is blindingly hot, but 
your moistened bangs serve as 
a visor and a sort of cool mop 
atop your head. A grey squirrel 
shuffles over to within a foot 
or so of your feet, gazing up 
at you with a look that wants 
something but doesn’t seem to 
remember what exactly. Being 
possessive of your ice cream, 
you kick your foot to motion the 
animal away.
Just as quickly as you got the 
urge to ask your dad to spend 
$1.50 on an ice cream bar, it’s 
done, and you hop off the bench 
to run back to the sandbox and 
the two friends you just made. 
They have a green castle-shaped 
bucket to make sandcastles 
and they need the materials. 
You dig like a madman under 
the assumption that this box 
contains an unlimited supply of 
sand running straight through 
to the earth’s core — if only 
you put in the effort to get it. 

Sure enough, though, you fairly 
quickly knock your scratching 
nails against a solid layer of 
wood that is the bottom of the 
box.
As the shadows of trees 
in 
early 
August 
begin 
to 
creep over the sandbox, you 
enthusiastically propose that 
you and your friends race to the 
top of the jungle gym. Without 
hearing an answer back, you run 
barefoot over hot black rubber 
(in your mind molten lava) to 
claim victory at the top. From 
here, you cover your eyes as you 
look out through the trees to the 
river. It glistens in the distance, 
allowing 
for 
the 
passing 
silhouettes of runners, bikers 
and dog walkers to be seen as 
they block its shine. From this 
great height of 10 feet, a wind 
suddenly whips up, blowing 
leaves from trees and prompting 
you and your pals to scream 
and and run for the ground. 
You jump down the slide, never 
admitting that you’re scared of 
sliding down the fire pole.
A game of tag breaks out in 
a sudden frenzy. Everyone is 
“it.” You’re feeling the sugar 
rush from that ice cream bar — 
those other kids are in trouble, 
because you just became Dash 
from “The Incredibles.” You run 
tirelessly about the jungle gym, 
the strong wind at your face an 
indicator of your speed, until 
you’ve huffed and puffed and 
can’t any longer. As you take a 
seat on the first step up to the 
slide, Dad comes over to say that 
you have to go in a minute.
In this sobering moment, 
you look around and see that 

the once luminous sun is now a 
blood orange orb nestled against 
the horizon. You notice that your 
exposed calves and forearms are 
now cool to the touch, a gentle 
graze provoking goosebumps. 
You look back at Dad and accept 
your return to reality as you get 
up to go. Time flies when you’re 
having fun.
Sitting on a small plastic seat 
in front of Dad on his bike, you 
casually drift down the park’s 
main strip with his sweater 
wrapped around you. As he 
turns on the front and rear lights, 
fireflies begin to glow. Instead of 
pondering the reasons for their 
glow, you instinctively grab 
for them as they come closer 
and closer to being within your 
grasp. You notice one or two 
dogs doing the same as you pass. 
After a bit of biking, your eyes 
begin to itch as if it were early 
April, as your eyelashes have 
failed to prevent unfiltered park 
and city air from carrying debris 
into their realm. You close your 
eyes for a bit, still able to make 
out the impressions of passing 
lights. You hear the occasional 
jangle of a dog’s leash or the cry 
of a far-off siren, but mostly just 
the low hum of the tires running 
on asphalt. You notice the park’s 
constant earthy scent — a scent 
of old wood, grass and soil — 
and become aware of whenever 
this is interrupted by aromas 
of subway vents, dog feces or 
sweaty runners. You open your 
eyes every so often, guessing 
where you are based on these 
clues. You’re forming memories 
in this moment and you don’t 
even know it.

An ode to the playground

B-SIDE: COMMUNITY CULTURE


According to their website, 
Mcity is collaborating with the 
University’s Transportation Insti-
tute to launch an on-demand, 
autonomous transportation sys-
tem in Ann Arbor by 2021.
Morton said Mcity’s next step 
would be working on individual, 
completely self-sufficient cars, an 
achievement she does not expect 
to see during her career due to the 
various hurdles in autonomous 
vehicle research. Citing a report 
by the Rand Corporation, Morton 
noted extensive work is still need-
ed to prove autonomous vehicles 
are at least as safe as human-oper-
ated cars.
“Forty-thousand people lose 
their lives in traffic accidents 
every year, that equates to rough-
ly one fatality per 100,000,000 
miles driven,” Morton said. “That 
means you’d have to travel, the 
Rand Report says, anywhere 
between 9 to 11 billion miles to 
prove these are safe, or safer than 
a human, statistically.”
In addition, Morton said, Mcity 
must consider regulations sur-
rounding autonomous vehicles. 
She said lawmakers have diffi-
culty keeping up with the pace of 
innovation.
“Michigan is doing a great job 
moving to be at the fore of try-
ing to understand how to safely 
deploy these on the roadways, but 
what will really unlock, I think, 
the potential of this technology 
is a national framework, which is 
what folks like Mcity and others 
are helping to try to inform,” Mor-
ton said.
Rebecca 
DeVooght, 
the 
University’s 
state 
relations 
director,agreed, adding the gen-
eral public has expressed con-

cern about autonomous vehicles, 
including the University’s shuttles 
— which are electric, 11-seat vehi-
cles produced by a French com-
pany called NAVYA — being used 
to inflict harm.
“The very first question, once 
we were in a NAVYA ride, was, 
‘How can these be used for nefari-
ous purposes?’” DeVooght said.
Morton 
expressed 
concern 
that the large-scale deployment 
of autonomous vehicles could dis-
rupt business in Southeast Michi-
gan. Gilchrist noted, however, 
the autonomous vehicle industry 
presents opportunities for new 
technical jobs.

“I really think that in terms of 
different ancillary opportunities, 
from a job creation and training 
perspective,” Gilchrist said. “A 
hardware and technician market 
needs to happen, and servicing 
and things, so you get to see that, 
that’s part of the whole ecosys-
tem.”
Despite 
the 
challenges 
in 
autonomous 
vehicle 
research, 
Morton praised Mcity’s work, say-
ing it has brought recognition to 
the state of Michigan and contrib-
uted to the development of a tech-
nology that could provide physical 
and economic mobility.
“It’s exciting to think that 
Michigan can be at the core of 
what the future looks like and 

all the opportunities this could 
bring,” Morton said. “It has given 
Michigan a brand that other 
states, other regions envy.”
Morton listed some of Mcity’s 
major focus areas, including user 
trust, market adoption, legal 
issues, privacy and security, as 
well as autonomous vehicle test-
ing. She also said Mcity places a 
strong emphasis on federal and 
state outreach alongside educa-
tion.
Through a partnership with 
the Michigan Economic Develop-
ment Corporation, Mcity has cre-
ated an incubator called TechLab 
which partners startups interest-
ed in autonomous vehicles with 
undergraduates at the University. 
According to Morton, TechLab 
works with about four companies 
a year.
Another example of Mcity’s 
outreach, Morton said, is a Teach-
Out on self-driving cars currently 
being hosted by the Office of Aca-
demic Innovation in partnership 
with MCity. Overall, Morton said 
working through the University 
presents Mcity with opportuni-
ties to share its work with faculty, 
students and industry members.
“The great thing about being 
at an institution like U-M, as 
you know, is a byproduct of our 
research is education,” Morton 
said. “When the talent pipeline is 
under such restriction, we’re look-
ing for every way possible to lever-
age our platform here to educate 
the next generation in this space, 
really the first generation actu-
ally.”
Gilchrist concluded his visit 
by heading to the Mcity track, 
though The Daily was asked not to 
join. He followed his tour of Mcity 
with a visit to Washtenaw Com-
munity College, which is also con-
ducting research on autonomous 
vehicle technology.

Alhasbani shared his story 
of moving from Yemen to the 
United States and establishing 
his coffee business. Born in 
Sana’a, Yemen, Alhasbani came 
to the United States in hopes of 
finding 
better 
opportunities. 
He worked as the Marketing 
Manager for Red Bull and Nestle, 
respectively, but after 17 years he 
moved to Michigan.
“I want to do something 
different,” Alhasbani said. “We 
own the best coffee in the world. 
So I think it’s time to do it.”
He quit his job at Nestle and 
began working on his coffee 
business in Dearborn. Alhasbani 
said 
he’s 
pleased 
with 
his 
decision, but acknowledged the 
initial challenges.
“It’s not easy — there’s no 
income,” Alhasbani said. “But I 
said, that’s fine. It’s going to be 
okay.”
Alhasbani opened Qahwah 
House in 2018. He intended 
for people to understand the 
country of Yemen and the story 
of its people.
“People see the coffee, but 
they don’t see how we bring it,” 
he said. “We talk to the people, 
tell them what’s going on in 
Yemen. They come to drink the 
coffee and we tell them our 
story.”
Alhasbani 
continued 
discussing the challenges Yemen 
is currently facing and how he 
tries to help.
“People don’t have food or 
medicine,” he said. “It’s not a 
small problem. It’s every house 
in Yemen. We try to send the 
message for people to help 
Yemen.”
Following his presentation, 

Alhasbani held a question and 
answer session. Many of the 
questions 
centered 
around 
Alhasbani’s business strategy. 
One audience member asked 
about his marketing strategy 
and why Alhasbani believed his 
coffee shop was so successful.
In part, Alhasbani said the 
publicity for the coffee shop 
comes about in a unique way.
“It’s social media,” he said. 
“They taste something good, 
they share it.”
Alhasbani was also asked 
about how he got the confidence 
to quit his job and trust that he 
would succeed.
“Believe in yourself. If you 
believe in yourself, you can do 
anything,” Alhasbani said. “But 
make a plan, take it step by step. 
Study and do research.”
Alhasbani 
also 
discussed 
his 
newfound 
connection 
to Michigan and the city of 
Dearborn. When he first came 
to the United States, Alhasbani 
moved 
to 
New 
York 
City. 
He compared New York to 
Michigan, explaining why he 
prefers Dearborn.
“Over there you have friends, 
but 
you 
never 
see 
them,” 
Alhasbani 
said. 
“Everyone’s 
busy. Here you feel like you’re 
home.”
He then talked specifically 
about his relationship with his 
customers in Dearborn and how 
he wants them to feel when 
visiting Qahwah House.
“I try to make it special for 
everyone,” Alhasbani said. “I 
want to keep it for everyone, for 
families and students, too.”
At the end of the event, 
Alhasbani opened up to the 
audience about the challenges he 
has faced.
“I 
didn’t 
have 
family,” 
Alhasbani said. “I didn’t have 

friends. I didn’t even have 
a driver’s license or a work 
permit.”
He then offered advice to those 
in the audience who are trying 
to decide what they want to do 
in their life, urging them not to 
choose a career just because of 
the money or their parents.
“Think a lot about what want 
you want to do,” Alhasbani said. 
“Then just do what you like.”
LSA junior Rasheed Abdullah 
helps with public relations for the 
Yemeni Students’ Association. 
He explained the organization 
wanted to share Alhasbani’s 
experiences and business.
“We 
wanted 
to 
showcase 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Yemeni 
community with a unique story,” 
Abdullah 
said. 
“We 
though 
hearing his entrepreneurial story 
would be a unique opportunity 
… With his success in the U.S. 
as a Yemeni immigrant, and 
his mission is to improve the 
conditions back in Yemen, that’s 
really inspiring.”
Public Health junior Jenna 
Chami initially came to the event 
for a class, but said she left with 
a greater understanding of the 
topic.
“It’s important to know that 
the coffee you’re drinking, it 
was hard to get,” Chami said. “I 
think the stories behind it would 
resonate with a lot of people.”
When Alhasbani was asked 
what he would tell a person who 
doesn’t know anything about 
Yemen or coffee who came into 
his shop, he offered a short and 
direct answer.
“You tell them everything’s 
good,” Alhasbnai joked. “Coffee 
is coffee. Good coffee, anyway.”

DATA FOR PUBLIC GOOD SYMPOSIUM

MICHAEL BAGAZINSKI/Daily
Attorney Sean H. Donahue, of the D.C.-based law firm Donahue, Goldberg, and Weaver, LLP, gives a lecture on the rollback of 
climate protection acts by the Trump Administration as part of the ELPP Lecture Series Tuesday afternoon.

Puscas said LSA SG has 
been working to bring this 
resolution to the floor for 
close to two years. The spon-
sors of the resolution said it 
was “common sense” that 
students should be allowed 
to take the last semester 
pass/fail, since all other LSA 
requirements, like quantita-
tive reasoning, do not need 
to be taken for a grade to 
count toward the distribution 
requirement. Puscas said this 
disparity is unfair for stu-
dents who may have difficul-
ties learning languages.
“Some students may strug-
gle with learning a language, 
whereas other students may 
excel at that,” Puscas said. 
“But if I have a lot of difficul-
ty working with numbers and 
models and stuff, I can take 
my QR requirement pass/fail. 
However, if I’m a student that 
struggles learning languages, 
that isn’t a liberty on the final 
course of the sequence that’s 
afforded to me.”
Reid, who serves on the 
technology, advising and aca-
demic committee, said a cur-
riculum committee meeting 
in 1994 determined that stu-

dents who take the language 
requirement pass/fail show 
“minimal interest” and “put 
forth minimal effort” in the 
courses. Reid contested these 
claims, saying students who 
take courses pass/fail are 
actually better able to explore 
their interest in the language 
without worrying about GPA.
“The stigma is still there 
around taking a class pass/
fail,” Reid said. “So I think 
this is one of many projects 
we hope to pursue in terms 
of trying to reverse the nar-
rative on this stigma around 
pass/fail courses.”
Ammond, who serves as the 
chair of the academic affairs 
committee for LSA SG, also 
noted how a student taking a 
course pass/fail is held to the 
same standard as those tak-
ing it for a grade.
“The threshold for receiv-
ing this proficiency credit is 
a C-, which is also the thresh-
old for pass or fail,” Ammond 
said. “That’s roughly about a 
30 percent, a 70 percent is a 
C- in a curved course. Your 
participation grade is roughly 
a 30 percent. So if you don’t 
participate at all, you’re not 
going to pass a class, because 
if you don’t participate at all 
it’s highly unlikely you’ll get 
a 100 percent on everything 
else. So the argument that 
these students aren’t partici-

pating at all just doesn’t make 
any sense.”
LSA SG also passed a res-
olution 24 to 0 in favor of 
working to fix MCard read-
ers in residence halls, which 
they said repeatedly fail to 
work. Reid said a survey sent 
out to students showed that 
86.1 percent of respondents 
had to swipe their MCards at 
least three times, making the 
process frustrating and inef-
ficient for residents.
The government also voted 
to confirm Nicholas Fadanel-
li, Rackham student and for-
mer LSA SG president, as 
elections director for their 
upcoming 
election. 
Before 
bringing the vote to the table, 
LSA SG President Nathan 
Wilson, LSA senior, praised 
Fadanelli’s previous work as 
elections director.
“He’s 
been 
a 
dedicated 
member of student govern-
ment for his four years of 
undergraduate 
education,” 
Wilson said. “He was our 
elections director last semes-
ter and we believe he does 
an excellent job running the 
election. He produced the 
most comprehensive report 
that has ever been produced 
by an elections director and 
he has been working with us 
since producing that report 
on improving our processes 
for elections.”

“Many people and individuals 
within our communities, such as 
you all, have already been actively 
working 
to 
make 
sustainable 
changes, but we can’t do this alone. 
We have to come together, and 
that’s exactly what this is today.”
The panelists who spoke at the 
event were Adam Simon, professor 
of 
earth 
and 
environmental 
sciences at the University; Joshua 
MacDonald, energy coordinator for 
Ann Arbor; Dominic Bednar, third-
year PhD student in Environment 
and Sustainability and Rackham 
student Fern MacDougal, who 
studies conservation energy.
The 
panel 
responded 
to 
questions about what challenges 
hinder the University’s progress 
when it comes to fighting climate 
change and what steps students 
and community members might 
take 
to 
tackle 
them. 
Adam 
Simon, professor of earth and 
environmental sciences at the 
University 
highlighted 
faculty 
members’ lack of acknowledgment 
of the magnitude and complexity 
of the issues concerning climate 
change we face as a major obstacle 
to 
progress. 
He 
emphasized 
the importance of seeking help 
in 
improving 
sustainability 
initiatives.
“I think if we were willing to 
accept that we don’t have to know 

everything nor can we, then we 
would make progress at a much 
faster right,” Simon said.
Dominic 
Bednar, 
third-year 
PhD student in Environment 
and Sustainability emphasized 
the importance of emphasizing 
diversity 
within 
the 
climate 
change movement.
“Climate 
change 
disproportionately 
affects 
low 
income people of color, so how 
do we weave those people into 
the conversation to, again, help 
us 
understand,” 
Bednar 
said. 
“We don’t necessarily have all 
the answers, but when you put a 
diverse group of people together 
you’re able to innovate much more 
rapidly.”
Simon also proposed that the 
multitude of clubs on campus 
focused on climate change should 
come together to ensure their 
collective impact is lasting.
“Your time on campus is finite,” 
Simon said. “You are here, you are 
loud, you’re gonna leave. And you 
have to make sure when you’re 
gone the next group of students is 
going to be as loud as you are.”
Following the panel, attendees 
split into small groups to discuss 
the ideas put forth by the panelists. 
A list of prompts were projected on 
the front of the room, encouraging 
attendees to brianstorm the best 
ways to take action.
Students also shared what 
brought them to the event. LSA 
sophomore Aviva Nemeth said she 

wanted to learn how to do more to 
fight climate change.
“I’m here because I don’t really 
know that much about what’s 
happening on the Ann Arbor level 
or on the University level beyond, 
like, putting compost bins in the 
dorms,” Neveth said.
While in groups, attendees 
were also encouraged to submit 
words or phrases into a word 
bubble which was subsequently 
projected and used to guide the 
whole group discussion. Some of 
the most prominent words and 
phrases 
were 
“accountability,” 
“intersectionality,” “strike” and 
“reaching across the aisle.”
The leaders of the event then 
picked out major words and asked 
attendees to share what they had 
discussed in their groups. LSA 
sophomore Basil Alsubee shared 
his ideas on the point of bringing 
more diverse voices into the 
climate change movement.
“A lot of the times as a person of 
color, you know, communities of 
color, we have an issue where we, 
for various reasons, are a little bit 
cynical about the climate change 
movement, and it’s not very high 
on our list of priorities,” Alsubee 
said. “The question of bringing 
more people of color into rooms 
like this, to enter this conversation 
where it’s not sort of seen as a 
conversation for quote, unquote 
‘hipster white people’, I think is a 
major, major obstacle we have to 
overcome.”

It’s exciting to think 
that Michigan can 
be at the core of the 
future

The second speaker was Kang 
Chol-Hwan, 
a 
North 
Korean 
defector, who was imprisoned in a 
North Korean concentration camp 
after his grandfather was accused 
of treason.
He is currently the founder and 
president of the North Korea Strat-
egy Center, an organization dedi-
cated to educating North Korean 
defectors and bringing awareness 
to human rights abuses committed 
by the North Korean government. 
Kang’s time at the Gulag concen-
tration camp is what led him to 
make the choice to defect.
“The concentration camps in 
North Korea are shockingly ter-
rible; they are like the Nazi camps 
under Hitler and Stalin’s labor 
camps except that they have last-
ed longer,” Kang said in Korean*. 
“There has not been a concentra-
tion camp in history that lasted for 
more than 50 years; North Korea is 
the only one.”

Despite there initially being 
hope in the new ruler due to his 
Western education, Kim Jong-un 
has executed more citizens and 
government officials — including 
his own aunt, his father’s wife as 
well as high ranking military offi-
cials — than his father and pre-
decessor, Kim Jong-il, in the last 
decade.
Kang further elaborated on Kim 
Jong-un’s attempt at recovering 
his country by taking part in talks 
with the American government.
“He’s infiltrating his own gov-
ernment,” Kang said. “There is 
no longer trust in the regime. It’s 
weak. That is why he met with 
Trump, to lift the sanctions. If 
President Trump addresses the 
issue of human rights in exchange 
for denuclearization there is a high 
chance that North Korea will col-
lapse in the next couple years. But 
given current talks, there is a high 
chance that Trump is falling for 
the lies of Kim Jong-un.”

Look what’s going down: 
Protesting in Ann Arbor

LENI SINCLAIR

ALIX CURNOW
Daily Arts Writer

B-SIDE LEAD

There’s nothing special about 
a street corner. It’s only a tiny 
intersection 
that 
thousands 
of busy passerbys see in their 
peripheral vision on their drive 
to work each day. Thoughts of 
their to-do lists or annoyance 
at the poorly made coffee the 
barista gave them that morning 
are given far more room in 
their minds. Ann Arbor street 
corners have been stepped on 
and overlooked for decades. 
Yet, they have felt the feet of 
 
thousands of protestors beating 
against their pavement. They 
have heard the voice of John 
Lennon singing the words “Free 
John Sinclair” to a crowd of 
thousands. They have seen the 
delicate intricacies of an LGBT 
couple interlocking fingers in 
nervous excitement publicly for 
the first time. They have smelled 
the sourness of illegal (and now 
legal) marijuana being lit from 
the carefully rolled joints of 
college students for decades.
How many eyes have grazed 
over these idle street corners? 
And who did those eyes belong 
to? What did these people 
believe in? Who are they now? 
Street 
corners 
have 
been 
holding up the city of Ann Arbor 
for decades. Decades that were 
filled 
with 
groundbreaking 
political 
movements, 
new 
scientific 
discoveries 
and 
innovative musical melodies. 
Decades that have slipped away 
from us, falling into the all-
consuming creature that is “the 
passing of time.”
However, the memories of 
these decades can forever be 
retold to all ears who are willing 
to listen. When I interviewed 
Jeff Gaynor, a retired Ann 
Arbor teacher who studied at 
the University of Michigan from 
1968 to 1971, memories of the 
past seemed to come flooding 
back to him. After graduating 
from 
Cass 
Technical 
High 
School, Gaynor came to the 
University as a freshman in 
the fall of 1968. It was the only 
school he’d applied to. He’d play 
pool in the billiards room and 
go bowling in the Union. His 
freshman year was also a huge 
year politically for the United 
States.
“The 
assassinations 
of 
Martin Luther King and Robert 

Kennedy, Vietnam, huge protests 
of the Democratic Convention 
in Chicago, etc. — the latter 
happening just after I arrived at 
U-M. But my freshman year, the 
student protest was to establish 
a student-run bookstore,” said 
Gaynor in an email to The Daily.
“There 
were 
only 
two 
bookstores 
students 
had 
to 
buy textbooks: Ulrich’s and 
Follett’s,” he continued, “and we 
considered them to be capitalist 
businesses that were ripping off 
the students. (Students) wanted 
the University to fund our own 
bookstore. There were marches 
and protests, and one Saturday 
night students occupied the 
Administration Building – what 
became the LS&A building on 
State St.”
“I was involved enough so 
that when the administration 
placed a memo in all of the 
dorm mailboxes, giving their 
perspective but not allowing the 
protesting students to do the 
same, I was livid,” he said. “I 
found a friend and walked down 
S. University to the president’s 
house, knocked on the door, 
and asked to speak to President 
Fleming. We were ushered in, 
and 5 minutes later he came down 
and spoke with us, probably for 
10 minutes. I left unhappy that 
we couldn’t convince him of the 
righteousness of our position, 
but I gained a lot of respect for 
him for speaking with us. It was 
more common in those days 
for hundreds of protesters to 
assemble on his lawn, and chant. 
Who knew that you could knock 
on his door in the middle of the 
day and actually talk with him!”
Bookstore 
protests 
didn’t 
seem to be the only political 
movements 
students 
were 
getting involved in during this 
time. Gaynor explained that in 
his sophomore year (1969-1970) 
he saw the emergence of BAM 
(the Black Action Movement) 
at the University. The Black 
Action Movement was a series of 
protests by students against the 
racist policies and actions of the 
University of Michigan.
“I wasn’t centrally involved, 
but I was supportive,” Gaynor 
said. “One day, I remember 
being in the lobby of South Quad 
talking with another student, a 
Black student, who was on the 
football team. I asked him if he 
was going to be participating in 
the student strike that the BAM 

organizers had called for. He 
paused, looked at me straight in 
the eye, and said, ‘Bo says, ‘No!’’”
Gaynor 
went 
on, 
“Bo 
Schembechler was the football 
coach, if I need explain. I was 
flabbergasted, but realized that 
scholarship athletes didn’t have 
the autonomy to make decisions 
that other students had. It also 
made me realize that U-Mich 
athletes were athletes first, and 
students only incidentally.”
It’s important to note that 
political movements such as 
the 
ones 
BAM 
participated 
in during this time are still 
being fought for today. The 
first protest that BAM ignited 
was after the assassination of 
Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968; 
the students protested against 
the University administration 
for lack of support for minorities 
on campus. In September of 
2017, racial slurs were written 
on dorm door nametags and 
students took to the lawn of 
President Schlissel’s home and 
protested in a manner similar to 
the protests Gaynor describes.
The incident was featured 
in Teen Vogue, which wrote, 
“On September 20, nearly 200 
students, 
including 
members 
of the Black Student Union 
and 
student 
organization 
Students4Justice, 
protested 
(the racial slurs) on campus, 
leading to a meeting that night 
with 
University 
president 
Mark Schlissel and University 
police chief Robert Neumann 
— a meeting that Schlissel 
ultimately left early, to the 
ire of students. A white man, 
who was ultimately arrested, 
harassed protesters with racial 
slurs which led to a physical 
confrontation.” 
Perhaps 
the 
past isn’t as different from 
today as we are lead to believe.
“There was a significant 
town-gown split — the campus 
being liberal and the rest of Ann 
Arbor being quite conservative,” 
says Gaynor about the political 
climate in Ann Arbor at the 
time. “It was the time of student 
power so we felt it natural that 
we could advocate powerfully 
for change. The SDS (Students 
for a Democratic Society) had 
formed before I arrived on 
campus. Meanwhile there were 
many Republicans in Ann Arbor 
back then. In fact, there was a 
Republican mayor.”
It was this exact political 

divide in Ann Arbor that ignited 
movements such as “Free John 
Sinclair.” Sinclair was one of the 
founders of the political party 
The White Panthers. The White 
Panthers were a far left, anti-
racist, White American political 
collective. John Sinclair was 
sent to prison in Jackson, Mich., 
serving 
an 
eight-and-a-half 
to 10 year sentence for giving 
two marijuana cigarettes to an 
undercover police officer in 
1967. In response to his arrest, 
a “John Sinclair Freedom Rally 
and Concert” was organized.
According to an essay written 
for the Ann Arbor District 
Library by Rob Hoffman, a 
former 
sports 
reporter 
for 
the Ann Arbor News, “Leni 
(Sinclair) had spent the evening 
of Dec. 10, 1971, manning a 
table on the Crisler concourse 
where she sold merchandise 
and distributed literature for 
the political party founded by 
her then-husband, the White 
Panthers. By her side were her 
two young children. Between 
the table and her parenting 
responsibilities, she admitted 
she remembered very little about 
the music and speeches taking 
place on the main stage - except 
for the surprise appearance by 
one of her personal favorites, 
Stevie Wonder.”
Hoffman went on to write that, 
“The night, however, belonged 
to two main attractions: John 
Lennon, 
performing 
live 
in 
the United States for the first 
time since the breakup of the 
Beatles. And there was Sinclair 
himself, in a phone call piped 
over Crisler’s PA system ... It was 
a semi-clandestine call — one 
that Sinclair didn’t think would 
happen until he noticed that 
the prison guards were paying 
more attention to the game on 
TV than to what he was doing. 
About 48 hours after Lennon 
closed the concert by singing 
‘Free John Sinclair,’ a song he 
had especially written for the 
event, Sinclair walked out of his 
prison cell and into the arms of 
a sobbing Leni and their two 
children.”
I had the opportunity to speak 
on the phone with Amy Cantu, a 
librarian at Ann Arbor District 
Library and organizer of the 
2011 program “Freeing John 
Sinclair: The Day Legends Came 
to Town.” This was a series of 
events celebrating the launch of 
AADL’s Freeing John Sinclair 
website and marking the 40th 
anniversary of the John Sinclair 
Freedom Rally that took place 
in Ann Arbor on December 10, 
1971. Cantu has spoken with 
Sinclair herself.
“He doesn’t hold back,” Cantu 
said of Sinclair. “He says what he 

thinks and he’s very thoughtful 
and willing to share.”
Although I did not get a 
chance to interview John or Leni 
Sinclair myself, I watched the 
panel discussion he participated 
in amongst many other members 
of The White Panther Party 
during 
the 
“Freeing 
John 
Sinclair: The Day Legends Came 
to Town” program curated by 
Cantu. 
Retired 
Professor 
Bruce 
Conforth moderated this panel. 
When discussing the ideas The 
White Panther party promoted, 
Conforth asked Sinclair, “Are 

you still putting together the 
idea that, come out in the open 
and smoke some dope with 
us, pass the joint around to 
your friends, doesn’t it make 
you feel good, doesn’t it make 
you want to fuck, well then go 
right ahead. Because after all, 
what we want is fucking in the 
streets.’” 
Sinclair 
responded 
with a solemn, “Amen.”
Conforth followed up his 
question by asking, “What were 
you thinking?”
Sinclair replied: “Thinking? 
Does thinking have anything to 
do with a statement like that? 
We also had an expression at 
that time called cut your head 
off, stop thinking, follow your 
body. That would be part of 
that rhetoric. Cut your head off, 
get rid of it. People thinking 
too much. Thinking was what 
got them into the war and the 
whole ugly shit that America 
has become all came from 

white men with a lot of money 
thinking about how they wanted 
a perfect world. Now they have 
it. Do you like it? It’s like Frank 
Zappa said. Do you love it? Do 
you hate it? There it is, the way 
you made it.”
The 
energy 
surrounding 
Sinclair’s 
statements 
was 
palpable, and truly a testament 
to the times back then.
In 
my 
conversation 
with 
Cantu, she spoke of the energy of 
the streets of Ann Arbor during 
the ’60s. “Ann Arbor tapped into 
that whole social protest of the 
period. It was fueled by some of 
the groups that were here. It had 
kind of its own energetic era,” 
she said.
The energy Ann Arbor had 
then is still lingering in the 
street 
corners 
somewhere, 
although now, it may be a bit 
harder to find. Gaynor attested 
to the belief that although 
Ann Arbor isn’t the same as it 
once was there are still some 
dangerous similarities.
“I’ve always said Ann Arbor 
is a great town to live in if 
you’re educated and/or wealthy 
enough — and that is even more 
true now,” Gaynor said. “More 
people want to live here, and an 
even greater number can’t afford 
to. This is true for students too, 
I’m sure. I paid $480 a year for 
tuition in ’68-69. When I lived 
off campus, I paid $150 a month 
rent – or less when I lived with 
more people. And as liberal as 
Ann Arbor pretends to be, many 
long time Ann Arbor residents, 
especially homeowners, don’t 
want new development, don’t 
want Ann Arbor to change.”
The fights that were being 
fought back then are largely the 
fights we are fighting now. Yet 
during the time of the White 
Panther Party, there seemed to 
be an altruistic energy to their 
protests. Now, it seems that 
people profit and capitalize 
off of the “coolness” of the 
’60s, as seen through the mass 
marketing of flower crowns and 
bell bottom jeans. Our obsession 
with the aesthetic of the ’60s and 
’70s rather than their cultural 
importance 
perpetuates 
a 
culture of people fighting for the 
perfect Instagram photo rather 
than equal rights. Or perhaps a 
culture obsessed with trying to 
wistfully regain a past that is 
looked at with such affection. 
But these are only prototypes 
and renditions of an era with 
an 
authenticity 
and 
energy 
that cannot be replicated. And 
though the era cannot be so 
easily replicated, it can certainly 
teach us all something. These 
Ann Arbor street corners have 
thousands of stories to tell — we 
should be listening.

‘Close Friends’

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘CLOSE FRIENDS’

It’s funny. For a song detailing 
the circumstances surrounding 
an ugly breakup between Lil 
Baby and his former girlfriend/
best friend, a surprisingly short 
amount of time in the “Close 
Friends” music video is devoted 
to the two former lovers. In 
fact, there are several shots 
of Lil Baby slouching on the 
balcony of a Parisian apartment, 
and there are even more shots 
of him riding around Paris 
in a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, 
rapping 
emphatically. 
After 
all, it is a rap video — these 
lackluster scenes are industry 
standards at this point, and it 
doesn’t appear they are going 
away any time soon. As such, 
these tropes are to be expected 
and sufficiently ignored.
On top of this, the video has 
a few glaring issues, primarily 
Lil Baby’s acting. It is so robotic 
and flat-out bizarre that it’s 

hard not to laugh. The tender 
opening dinner scene between 
the Atlanta crooner and his 
girlfriend (who is Lil Baby’s 
actual 
girlfriend) 
is 
made 
absurd by Lil Baby’s writhing 

and 
constant 
motion. 
The 
scene portraying an argument 
in which the woman swipes 
a video game controller from 
Baby’s hand is ruined by his 
inability 
to 
feign 
emotion, 
instead opting to cease all 

movement until the camera 
changes focus. With this in 
mind, it is wholly possible for 
viewers to display more emotion 
while watching the video than 
Lil Baby does while acting in it.
With 
“Close 
Friends,” 
director DAPS, the man once 
renowned 
for 
his 
surreal, 
almost whimsical music videos 
for the likes of Kendrick Lamar 
and Migos, seems to have 
lost his edge. While visually 
stunning, DAPS videos become 
stale rather quickly, and the 
one for “Close Friends” is no 
exception. Perhaps it is because 
DAPS has oversaturated the 
market with his repeated use 
of the same creative vision for 
every single one of his videos. 
It’s hard to say, really. But hey, at 
least it looks nice.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

As a movement, March 

For Our Lives was truly the 
first of its kind. Children 
from middle school and up 
across the nation confronted 
lawmakers for their inaction 
and 
demanded 
common-

sense 
gun 
control. 
We 

commend these students and 
their efforts to call attention 
to the crisis of gun violence 
in America.

As 
student 
journalists, 

we at The Michigan Daily 
feel a special connection 
to the young people who 
have continuously updated 
SinceParkland.org 
— 
a 

website run by teens that 
documents the horrible and 
far too common incidence of 
young lives taken too soon 
by firearms. In an exemplary 
display of journalism done 
right, these young reporters 
seek to humanize — rather 
than simply empiricize — the 
deaths of those their age. 
These activists are deserving 
of our utmost respect and 
gratitude as their impact 
on the national discourse 
regarding this contentious 
“wedge” 
issue 
has 
been 

immeasurable.

As a unit, these youth 

activists have seen gains 
made in the wake of their 
tireless work. For example, 
a majority of Republicans — 
whose policies lean favorably 
toward the gun lobby — now 
support raising the legal 
gun-buying age to 21 from 
18. On the legislative side, 
we saw an NRA-endorsed 
Republican 
administration 

ban “bumpstocks,” a move 
that coincides with point 
number five on the March 
For Our Lives policy agenda: 
“Limit firing power on the 
streets.” 
Furthermore, 
a 

day 
before 
the 
one-year 

anniversary of the Parkland 
shooting, House Democrats 
backed a bill that would 
require background checks 
for all sales and transfers 
of guns — a policy that 
92 
percent 
of 
Americans 

support. 
The 
significance 

of these gains should not be 
understated and they are far 
from the only ones.

At 
the 
same 
time, 

however, 
we 
still 
have 

great strides to make. Since 
Parkland, more than 1,200 
children have been killed 
in 
acts 
of 
gun 
violence 

throughout 
the 
country. 

This should galvanize the 
nation 
to 
advocate 
even 

more fiercely for legislative 
change.

While 
the 
proverbial 

gears have been turning and 
things seem to be trending 
in 
the 
right 
direction, 

most 
of 
the 
legislation 

that 
has 
actually 
been 

passed 
and 
implemented 

since the tragedy has been 
fairly cosmetic and fails to 
bring about the sweeping 
fundamental changes needed 
to beat back the rising tide 
of gun violence. We urge 
legislators 
to 
properly 

uphold their duty to serve 
their constituents. Part of 
doing so requires that they 
take substantive action on 
the issue of gun control in 
order to ensure safety for all, 
so that no child has to feel 
scared while pursuing an 
education.

Regrettably, 
the 

movement for increased gun 
control 
has, 
historically, 

been 
far 
more 
reactive 

than proactive. We see a 
groundswell 
of 
support 

for these measures in the 
immediate 
aftermath 
of 

these 
mass 
shootings, 

only to see said support 
subsequently begin to wane 
until it eventually returns 
to its baseline. This is in 
spite of the fact that mass 
shootings in this country 
occur on a daily basis. We 
simply 
cannot 
afford 
to 

succumb 
to 
complacency. 

Sustained collective action 
is what is needed to inspire 
change.

We also would like to 

take this time to condemn 
those insidious voices on 
the far-right who attacked 
the heroism of the March 
For 
Our 
Lives 
activists. 

Disinformation 
agents, 

such as radio host Alex 
Jones, 
spread 
malicious 

conspiracy theories meant 
to turn the public against 
the movement. Jones even 
went so far as to claim that 
the Parkland students who 
spoke up about the trauma 
of being forced to endure 
the sudden loss of 17 of their 
fellow 
schoolmates 
were 

crisis actors and that the 
shooting itself was just one 
big “deep state false flag 
operation.” Fox News host 
Laura Ingraham and former 
Milwaukee 
Sheriff 
David 

Clark also chimed in with 
their 
regularly 
scheduled 

programming of hate and 
vitriol, 
going 
on-air 
to 

target 
survivors 
such 
as 

student David Hogg.

These 
public 
figures 

consciously 
attempted 
to 

manipulate 
the 
narrative 

to 
paint 
honest, 
well-

intentioned student activists 
as 
the 
bad 
actors. 
Such 

malevolence not only poisons 
our media ecosystem, but 
it also discourages future 
student activism of all kinds 
as people fear becoming the 
victims of targeted attacks.

We remember the lives 

of the students killed at 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School as well as every 
victim of all mass shootings 
before and since. We will 
continue 
forward 
with 

optimism in this battle, as we 
look to activists, journalists 
and everyday citizens alike 
to continue calling attention 
to gun violence. We also 
hope that those in political 
office will be receptive to 
the demands of such broad 
swaths of the population, 
and enact the policies that 
will facilitate the positive 
changes we wish to see.

Environmental racism in America

A

ll stories are composed 
of five basic parts: an 
exposition, 
an 
inciting 

event, a climax, a resolution and a 
conclusion. In the United States, 
there are many ongoing stories 
related to the injustices faced by 
minority groups. These forms of 
injustice range from the rise and 
fall of the Jim Crow laws, Japanese 
internment camps and President 
Donald Trump’s Muslim ban — 
just to name a few.

Each form of injustice was 

(and is) rooted in racism, bigotry 
and xenophobia. Each form of 
injustice has its own story, and 
each story is full of characters 
— protagonists and antagonists 
alike. These unfolding stories have 
shaped the history of our country 
and continue to write our future, 
as myriad forms of injustice are 
still prevalent in the very fabric of 
our society. Many of these issues 
continue to tear apart our already 
divided society and any resolution 
to mitigate these injustices.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 

once said, “We have flown the air 
like birds and swum the sea like 
fishes, but have yet to learn the 
simple act of walking the earth like 
brothers.” Humans have put a man 
on the moon, but cannot figure out 
how to live together in harmony. 
Is this due to our inherent self-
interest and neglect of altruistic 
principles? Environmental racism 
and the disproportionate impact 
of environmental hazards on low 
socioeconomic minority groups 
exhibits our apparent inability to 
reconcile these ideals.

The exposition is multifaceted. 

Environmental racism is rooted in 
the continued racial discrimination 
towards Black people since the end 
of slavery. Throughout history, 
people of color have been subject 
to unfair housing, inequitable 
zoning 
policies 
and 
limited 

say in land allocation and use. 
These factors have cumulatively 
produced environmental racism 
that has lead to a myriad of health 
risks associated with air and water 
quality.

However, 
the 
magnitude 

of the injustice would not have 
been understood if not for the 
exploratory 
work 
published 

in 
Rachel 
Carson’s 
“Silent 

Spring.” The book sparked the 
environmental movement, lead to 
the ban of DDT, the amendment 
and creation of laws concerned 
with our environment and most 
importantly the institution of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, 

or the EPA — the preeminent 
regulatory 
agency 
dedicated 

towards environmental policy.

This inciting event involves the 

most influential protagonist in the 
fight for racial equality, Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. In 1968, Martin 
Luther King, Jr went to Memphis, 
Tenn. to support the strike of 
sanitation workers who were not 
being properly compensated for 
their dangerous and dirty work. 
The workers were subject to health 
concerns from the chemicals in 
the sewage to the contaminants 
from the waste. In pursuit of 
equality, King’s actions lead to the 
establishment of the Clean Water 
Act and Fair Housing Act, two 
influential pieces of legislation 
in 
curtailing 
the 
impact 
of 

environmental racism. Memphis 
was a preeminent example of 
environmental racism and set 
the stage for the environmental 
justice movement by fortifying 
the connection between issues 
pertaining to the environment and 
issues of racial equality.

The climax took place in 1982 

as the state of North Carolina 
planned to relocate 60,000 tons 
of 
Polychlorinated 
Biphenyl 

(PCB) contaminated soil to the 
rural Warren County, N.C. — a 
majority Black community with 24 
percent of people living under the 
poverty line. The PCB landfill was 
feared to leak and contaminate 
the community’s water and air 
quality, as PCB is a carcinogenic 
toxin. However, the people did not 
have adequate resources to fend 
for themselves, so they resorted 
to peaceful protest reminiscent 
of those encouraged by Martin 
Luther King, Jr.

The scene was best depicted by 

an iconic photograph of six Black 
men lying face up in the middle 
of a country road as six trucks 
full of toxic soil are stopped in 
the distance. The state ultimately 
took advantage of the community, 
bypassed the protesting citizens 
and built the landfill. The inherent 
racism in the land use brought 
environmental justice concerns 
into the national spotlight.

Despite coming to national 

attention over three decades ago 
in Warren County, environmental 
racism and injustice continue to be 
prevalent in society as more than 
half of people that live in proximity 
to a landfill, hazardous waste 
site or other industrial facility 
are people of color. In addition, 
water contamination plagues low-
income areas around the country 

as best exemplified by the lead 
issues permeating through Flint.

Therefore, 
while 
we 
are 

confronted with the issue of how 
to promote a resolution to this 
issue, we must also ask how we 
can move forward and close the 
chapter of environmental racism 
and injustice.

For starters, we need to 

force businesses to be more 
environmentally conscious and 
decrease the mass production 
of harmful chemicals. Between 
Baton 
Rouge 
and 
New 

Orleans, communities that are 
predominantly minority and low-
income make up “Cancer Alley.” 
Cancer Alley contains more than 
150 
petrochemical 
companies 

and 17 refineries, all of which take 
advantage of poor communities 
and damage their health in 
exchange for corporate profits.

Just like corporations can 

greenwash by fabricating their 
reports, politicians can lie to 
leverage votes. Therefore, we 
need to step up come election 
time and vote for candidates that 
have a demonstrated interest in 
environmental issues to support 
their campaign promises. We 
cannot have leaders like former 
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who 
in 2013, despite the injustices in 
Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, offered 
Shell a $112 million incentive 
package with tax exemptions to 
create a new factory. Our elected 
leaders should not act in terms 
of profit. They should serve their 
constituents’ best interest.

We need to ensure laws 

already put in place to prevent 
discrimination 
are 
properly 

put into action. The biggest 
obstacle towards resolution is 
the government’s neglect to 
vigorously enforce the laws on 
the books.

With the Earth hanging on 

by a thread and on the brink of 
catastrophic 
and 
irreversible 

change, we need to prompt action 
and to recognize the far-reaching 
impacts of our behaviors. We are 
not fighting another civil rights 
battle, but we are fighting for our 
lives as the story of environmental 
racism continues to tragically 
unfold. The conclusion must 
be, then, to eliminate injustices, 
especially when its main vehicle 
is environmental catastrophe.

I 

was raised in a pro-life family. 
It was an implicit part of our 
Protestant Christianity. The 

fundamental ideas underlying our 
belief in the sanctity of life were 
that life begins at conception and 
every human being is endowed with 
a unique purpose from our creator. 
Psalm 139:16 says, “Your eyes saw 
my unformed body; all the days 
ordained for me were written in 
your book before one of them came 
to be.” This Bible passage, as well as 
others on the topic of life, leads many 
denominations of Christians to 
believe God knew us and planned for 
us before we were created through 
human conception. Therefore, the 
second we are fertilized we are not 
just another random human, but 
rather unique in form and loved 
unconditionally by our creator.

For 
me 
personally, 
though 

I remained a believer in Jesus 
Christ, the transition into my teen 
years began to make me question 
many of my beliefs, including my 
belief in the sanctity of an unborn 
life. High school accentuated the 
complexity of this issue within me as 
people I knew began to experience 
pregnancy scares. I spent more 
than one panicked night with a 
friend wondering how they would 
take care of a child financially, if the 
father would be supportive, if their 
parents would disown them and 
if their dreams for the future were 
essentially ruined if they chose to 
have the child. I began to put myself 
in these shoes as well, feeling with 
intensity that my whole life could 
be altered completely in a moment 
if I were to become pregnant. I 
also became more invested in the 
scientific view of life. Are we really 
no more than a clump of cells for 
weeks on end? When can a baby in 
the womb feel pain? When are the 
unborn sentient? Politically and 
ethically I began to hear both sides of 
a complex debate on when the right 
of a life inside the womb trumps the 

rights of the mother.

Additionally, I kept being told 

by so many of my peers as well as 
much of the media that if I didn’t 
support a woman’s right to choose 
then I was somehow betraying my 
own gender. I had also become more 
aware of the consequences women 
in unplanned pregnancy situations 
could potentially face, including 
physical and emotional abuse at the 
hands of their families and partners, 
exacerbated poverty and so much 
more. For these reasons my position 
as someone who still considered 
themselves fairly pro-life had shifted 
further away from this long held 
belief to a point where I openly 
considered myself pro-choice.

Then, I attended an apologetics 

conference 
through 
Summit 

Ministries 
the 
summer 
before 

my senior year, and that is when 
everything changed. Apologetics 
essentially is a branch of Christian 
theology that attempts to defend 
Christianity against objections, not 
just through the use of scripture but 
through science, philosophy and 
ethics. In a lecture given by Christian 
elocutor Megan Almon I learned 
the most important question in the 
abortion debate: “Are the unborn 
human?” I was forced to ask myself 
this over and over again. At first, I 
thought it was fair to say “they are 
becoming human.” Then I learned 
the scientific study of embryology 
affirms that once an egg is fertilized 
to become a zygote, it is at once a 
“highly specialized, totipotent cell 
[that] marks the beginning of each 
of us as a unique individual.” From 
the moment we become zygotes 
we are genetically distinct and 
totipotent, meaning that, aside from 
the nutrients we will use to grow 
from our mother, we have all the 
components we need to continue 
developing from within as a human 
being. We are not becoming human. 
We are human from the point of 
conception. We are living, we are 

distinct and we are whole, meaning 
we have all the fundamental 
characteristics of a unique living 
organism. As philosopher Richard 
Stith put it; like a picture taken 
on a Polaroid camera that we are 
waiting to develop, just because we 
can’t see our full form yet does not 
mean that we are not fully there. 
We aren’t being constructed from 
outside forces like pieces of a puzzle 
but instead we are developing from 
within ourselves, growing just like 
one small seed grows into a beautiful 
flower.

As 
these 
scientific 
and 

philosophical 
arguments 
began 

to sink in for me, I started to ask 
myself if I thought it was ok to kill 
an innocent child. So much rhetoric 
around the abortion debate says 
that it is not right to call abortion 
murder. Yet if I believed the unborn 
were human beings even in the first 
stages of their development then 
I felt morally compelled to believe 
their destruction was murder. This 
contradicted so much of what I 
had come to believe in the previous 
years. All of the arguments I heard 
between professors and peers didn’t 
really account for the unborn as 
being human and endowed with the 
same rights as all of us outside of the 
womb. They often focused solely on 
the rights of the mother. Arguments 
like: “As a woman, no one gets to 
restrict my autonomy over my 
body,” or, “if we force women to 
have unwanted children, they may 
not receive the care they deserve.” 
In addition, some say “Sometimes 
women with multiple children 
cannot afford to feed another child, 
and abortion gives women the 
freedom to continue pursuing their 
career goals.”

t’s now been just over a year since the day of the Parkland, 
Fla. shooting, in which 17 students at Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School were killed by a gunman. While these 

students can never be replaced, their fellow classmates saw this 
moment as an inflection point in our nation’s history, choosing to 
take action and try to ensure that no other student has to suffer 
such a tragic fate.

By 
the 
mid-1960s, 
shooting your film in black 
and 
white 
was 
already 
becoming a stylistic choice. 
Fighting against the pull of 
the 
monochromatic 
little 
television boxes that were 
more and more frequently 
gluing families to their living 
room 
sofas 
on 
Saturday 
nights, the industry made 
dazzling, 
colorful 
wide-
screen cinema the de-facto 
standard. Stalwarts of 
that era, Mike Nichol’s 
“The 
Graduate,” 
Arthur Penn’s “Bonnie 
and 
Clyde,” 
Jaques 
Demy’s “Umbrellas of 
Cherbourg,” couldn’t be 
reimagined in anything 
other than the lyrical 
color they’ve come to be 
known for, in much the 
same way we wouldn’t 
want to see “Casablanca” 
on 
Kodachrome 
film. 
In 
the 
forty 
years 
since 
Woody 
Allen’s 
“Manhattan,” 
black 
and white films have 
become more and more 
of a novelty, showing 
up sparingly, typically 
as 
art-house 
pieces 
looking 
to 
buck 
the 
studio-standard in more 
than one way. With the 
Oscars just a few days 
away, and with Cuarón’s 
heart-rending black and 
white feature “Roma” at 
the front of our minds, 
the state of modern black 
and white filmmaking is 
due for a checkup; a look 
in at how the black-and-
white cinematography is 
being used today.
“Roma” 
is 
verbally 
a 
nostalgia piece (Cuarón told 
IndieWire that “90 percent of 
the scenes” came straight from 
his memory). The filmmaker 
leans on what he knows and 
what he can recall, bringing 
the events of his childhood to 
life in crisp, clean, digitally 
captured black and white. 
The distinction here between 
shooting 
black 
and 
white 
on film versus digitally is 
important, as it speaks to the 
role Cuarón sees the technique 
playing in modern cinema. 
Cuarón’s black and white is 
not a grainy, rough emulation 

of classic Hollywood — it’s 
a 
much 
sharper, 
higher-
definition use of a color-set 
that, while once the norm out 
of necessity, can bring to a 
story an unconscious thematic 
weight when used in the right 
light.
Cutting away to a black and 
white scene in a full-color 
picture has been easy movie 
shorthand for a flashback 
or a memory for decades. 
“Spiderman: Into the Spider-
verse” 
(the 
biggest 
best-
picture snub of the year) uses 
sudden shifts to grey-scale 

in a few different contexts 
to indicate a jump into a 
character’s backstory or a 
reference to something that 
only existed in the past, and 
we as viewers didn’t need 
any notations on-screen to 
understand that. In general, 
we know without saying that 
the little boy watching the old 
car backdown the driveway 
in the rain is the younger 
version of our main character 
— that the unnamed boy in the 
hospital bed is the dying son of 
the presently grieving mother 
in our story. These types of 
moments 
in 
movies 
don’t 
represent the peak of creative 

screenwriting sometimes, but 
they’re 
producer 
favorites 
because they get the point 
across without too much of a 
hassle. The most important 
thing to recognize from them 
is how easy it is for us to 
notice and understand them 
as viewers.
I’d bet that most people’s 
first 
experience 
watching 
something in black and white 
is with something pretty old — 
rewinding a VHS of “Arsenic 
and Old Lace” found beneath 
a 
grandparent’s 
television 
set, slogging through re-runs 
of “I Love Lucy” on 
summer 
afternoons 
when nothing else is 
on — Cuarón shooting 
his entire feature in 
black and white, then, 
has some effect on us 
as viewers, impacting 
our 
first 
impression 
of the film to make it 
feel as if it was plucked 
straight out of time. 
The digital aspect of 
Cuarón’s 
photography 
fights against this a bit. 
Had Cuarón wanted to 
make a strict call-back 
to 
the 
Hollywood-of-
old (he wouldn’t have 
made a film focused on 
an immigrant working 
in domestic help) he 
would have shot on 16 
mm. 
Cuarón’s 
crisp, 
wide-format 
black-
and-white suggests of 
a new way to use this 
cinematic 
technique 
in a way that makes 
use of our unconscious 
associations with black-
and-white 
cinema 
to 
make 
nostalgic 
films, 
though films not trapped 
by 
the 
customs 
and 
expectations — by the baggage 
that comes with this two color 
range.
“Roma” 
could 
be 
the 
first of many more modern 
monochrome features to come, 
but I sort of doubt it. It works 
well in this case, but I struggle 
to see the technique breaking 
past the ‘niche’ area with just 
this one movie. “Frances Ha” 
was the last big, modern black 
and white film I can think of, 
and though it did well to give 
Noah Baumbach and Greta 
Gerwig a name, it didn’t send 
many directors running to 
their supply closets to dust off 
their grey hues. 

Experiencing cinema in 
black and white, literally

‘Danny Phantom’

in this series, three daily arts writers in 
varying states of mind visit the same 
place and write about their experiences.

baked.buzzed.bored.

this week’s destination:

Jazz! Is! Me! Casper high! Oh damn I get it — Casper the friendly ghost.
My powers my problems, sounds like an Ariana Grande song.
Buzzed is writing in actual paragraph form and I didn’t know 
until now!! Talk about a head start, honestly. And she’s 
typing like a maniac. I’m so confused. Entonces, 
here is my diatribe on why Tucker is a soft 
boy, Sam is everyone’s sexual awaken-
ing and Danny needs to do his 
homework.
Tucker, my dear, your back-
wards hat, the slightly skinny/baggy 
jeans with ankle boots reeks of classic soft-
boy syndrome. The confidence and swagger ooze 
of I don’t know what. This is starting to sound like 
an insult (?) and I don’t want it to be. Obviously, we love 
Tucker. A true king. His glasses are a time.
Samantha Sampson had flawless makeup at the age of 15 and, 
because “Danny Phantom” is def early 2000s, this fact is a work of nature. 
Or talented animators. However you want to think about it. Personally, I like 
the whole talented animator situation. I just like to appreciate the “behind-the-
scenes” thing. But anyways, her talents as a young artist probably indicate the work of a 
2005-era YouTube star ready to go and live her life. Anyways, good makeup is the begin-
ning of every successful relationship. Her coordinated outfits (purple and black!) exude 
the vibe of a girl quite clearly pulling off “Clueless” era fashion in a low-rise jean world. 
Further, not only does she embody the confident cool-girl attitude we all want, she’s rich!!
I can quote “Danny Phantom” and it concerns me so much.
Why do all these shows have social comments — no! I’m so confused.
Anyways, back to Danny. Danny man. High school is not going to last forever. You will 
have to go to college and if you’re always off fighting ghosts your grades will slip. Spider-
man was a kid genius and you seem like you barely have basic algebra skills. Anyways 
that’s why you gotta do your homework.
But we still love Danny and Sam and Tucker. “Danny Phantom,” you have my heart. You 
have our hearts.
Mood for 2019: “Hmm. Why do I feel like I’m so special and cute? Oh right! Because I 
am.”

Oh my god. That’s all I have to say. Who thought of this con-
cept. A boy ghost? Why is that so goddamn attractive? An alarm-
ing amount of women my age agree that Danny Phantom is at least 
somewhat of a snack — honestly it’s enough to warrant a psycho-
logical study. 
THIS THEME SONG SLAPS. Damn, where’s the Grammy? 
You’re telling me Cardi B won a Grammy before the writer of the 
“Danny Phantom” theme song? Why was the Fenton house — oh 
my god I get it phantom — FENTON. Anyway. The show must go 
on.
Quote: “These moms are all so thick, I feel like they are too thick 
for white women.” This was not spoken in “Danny Phantom.” 
This was spoken by Baked. I think she’s doing very well. Lay some 
respect on Elastigirl though. 
Some character analysis for you: Sam is so emo, honestly mood. 
Me too girl dont worry, you’ll get there one day. Tucker is the guy in 
your philosophy class that’s like “well I would love to get to know 
Kant on a personal level.” I just know he would raise his hand in 
class to play devil’s advocate in an abortion discussion.
Some appreciation for the background characters: That lunch 
lady is a straight savage, 10/10 would stan. I’m so proud of her — 
making a living for your family while stealing from the bourgeoi-
sie. Seize the sandwiches, seize the means, my comrade.
I’m beginning to think perhaps “The Incredibles” was a ripoff of 
“Danny Phantom.” Or was it the other way around? Oh wow they 
came out around the same time. What was with 2004 and having 
large chunky men married to woman with a big ass and snatched 
waist? Sorry to kinkshame you 2004, but you did give us Facebook 
which has become a bit of a problem.

Let’s get this out of the way: I have made a career out of being bored 
at parties. As a person who doesn’t drink that much, reaches Fox Mul-
der levels of paranoia while high and is too student-poor for anything 
better, I am more than used to chilling in the corner as my friends get 
progressively more wasted. I usually clock out at around 12:45 a.m. 
at any given party, as the voyeuristic fun of being nearly sober ends 
and people start to dance in basements. So, when I volunteered to be 
the “Bored” component of this “Danny Phantom” revival of Baked, 
Buzzed, Bored, it was a calling that I had only expected would 
come. Unsurprisingly, I was, ahem, bored. Despite this, 
our trip down memory lane was eventful, to say the 
least. 
As we flicked on Buzzed’s apartment TV and 
people settled into her couch, I was returned to 
my childhood immediately. My mom wouldn’t 
let me and my siblings watch Nickelodeon 
because it was “crass,” so much of my cartoon 
viewing was covert, including that of “Danny 
Phantom.” I used to watch the show ONLY 
when my babysitter was over, and it began a 
forbidden love story for the ages. As the theme 
song began, I was instantly taken back to those 
days. Almost like a call to action, the first notes 
of the episode rang out, and my mouth opened in 
a primal response: “Danny Phantom!”
Before we even decided to watch this for the Nos-
talgia B-Side, Baked, Buzzed and I have been members 
of a group chat titled “would fuck danny phantom.” Need-
less to say, our friend Danny was a mutual sexual awakening 
that can only be rivaled by teenage Simba in “The Lion King.” That 
platinum hair that pre-dated even Zac Efron’s foray into bleach? 
Revolutionary. That black ghost-suit and piercing blue eyes? Iconic. 
Learning that Danny is supposed to be 14 years old in the series made 
me feel a little creepy for acknowledging his undeniable allure, but I 
stand by my point. At 8, he was the height of boyish charm, a fact that 
we can all settle on.

The keys to Wolverines’ win streak

It’s hard to believe that, 
just four short weeks ago, the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team suffered a loss to Michigan 
State that put its tournament 
hopes on life support. Just two 
weeks later, freshman point 
guard Amy Dilk went down 
with an ankle injury, and the 
Wolverines’ slim odds became 
even slimmer on paper.
But, just as they have shown 
time 
and 
time 
again 
this 
season, Michigan has found 
a way to win. On the heels 
of six straight victories, the 
Wolverines finds themselves in 
the mix of the Big Ten and the 
NCAA Tournament picture.
While senior forward Hallie 
Thome 
grabbed 
headlines 
on Sunday after scoring the 
2,000th point of her Michigan 
career, junior forward Kayla 
Robbins was the night’s true 
star. The sophomore forward 
scored a career-high 15 points 
and hauled in five rebounds in 
just thirteen minutes of action 
against Illinois.
“We knew it was a matter of 

time,” head coach Kim Barnes 
Arico said in an interview with 
MGoBlueTV. “She’s been a 
difference-maker for us.”
Robbins’ performance is just 
one of the many examples of 
different Wolverines stepping 
up on a nightly basis.
After the win against the 
Illini, Barnes Arico called the 
victory “an incredible team 
effort.” While this was evident 
in Sunday’s triumph, it’s a 
quote that could truly be pulled 
from just about any game that 
the team has played over its 
recent 
hot 
streak. 
Despite 
being hampered by injuries 
and by fielding an extremely 
young roster, every player has 
recognized their role and filled 
it perfectly.
Perhaps the two players 
shouldering the biggest load 
are junior forward Akienreh 
Johnson and senior forward 
Nicole 
Munger, 
who 
have 
split the team’s point guard 
reps since Dilk was sidelined. 
The two have helped the 
offense 
play 
efficient 
and, 
more importantly, relatively 
turnover-free basketball.
While 
the 
team 
has 

improved 
drastically 
over 
the course of the season, it 
feels as if it is continuing to 
make progress every game. 
Especially with a young group, 
more game experience has 
sharpened the play of young 
stars like freshman forward 
Naz 
Hillmon. 
Sophomore 
guard 
Deja 
Church 
has 
improved drastically on drives 
to the rim as well as on the 
defensive end, and Johnson 
and Robbins have contributed 
too, 
making 
tremendous 
strides in their recent extended 
action. Elsewhere, the veteran 
leadership 
of 
Munger 
and 
Thome have helped to stabilize 
the offense as well as helping 
to guide the team through 
the Big Ten gauntlet that they 
have become all too familiar 
with over the course of their 
four years with the program. 
Simply put, this is a team that’s 
getting hot at the perfect time, 
and Barnes Arico believes that, 
once healthy, the best is yet to 
come for her squad. 
“One of the exciting things 
about our team is that we’re 
continuing to get better,” she 
said.

Bakich points to depth as key to 
Michigan baseball’s early success

With a runner on third, the 
Michigan baseball team was 
deadlocked with Binghamton 
4-4 in the eighth inning.
That didn’t last long.
Sophomore 
shortstop 
Jack 
Blomgren took the pitch and 
smashed a single up the middle 
to send senior infielder Blake 
Nelson home — giving his team 
the lead for good.
The Wolverines swept their 
opening weekend series against 
Binghamton and the unlikely 
heroes were in the bottom of 
their lineup.
“The 
guy 
(Blomgren) 
statistically who had the best 
weekend hit in our nine hole,” 
said Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“That’s just a credit to the really 
good hitters that we have on 
our team. What’s nice is that if 
somebody doesn’t have a great 
day then he can be picked up by 

someone else.”
Blomgren is part of a talented 
sophomore class that is expected 
to carry the load for Michigan 
this season. Bakich and his 
coaching staff seem to have found 
the right combination of players 
in their lineup as compared to a 
year ago which was overly reliant 
on the top of the batting order.
“In 
our 
5-4 
win 
(over 
Binghamton) on Saturday, I 
think the top of our lineup was 
like 0-for-15 and the bottom of 
our lineup carried us,” Bakich 
said. “But the day before, in the 
10-0 win, the top of our lineup 
had a great day and guys were 
smashing the ball all over the 
place. So it’s nice to have that 
balance, it’s nice to have multiple 
threats in the top, in the middle 
and in the bottom of the order. 
From a coaching standpoint, 
that’s the lineup we try to 
construct as you enter a season.”
In order for Michigan to be 
consistent this season, their role 

players will need to be prepared 
to step up.
Nelson also was instrumental 
in the second win, going 2-for-4 
with two runs-batted-in from the 
eighth spot. In the Wolverines’ 
first win, Blomgren shined again, 
going 3-for-4 with two RBIs 
while sophomore catcher Joe 
Donovan contributed with two 
hits and three RBIs at the seven 
spot.
For a team whose weakness 
last year was hitting, the early 
games are promising as Michigan 
has scored 27 runs in just three 
games.
“Yeah it’s an older lineup, 
there’s not a freshman in the 
starting lineup and what we 
have is we have balance,” Bakich 
said. “We have one through nine 
guys that are threats either with 
their speed, their power, or with 
just their general hitting ability. 
When you have a veteran lineup 
like that, it’s tough to pitch to and 
there’s no let-up.”

Amid struggles, Hutchins challenges upperclassmen to right the ship

Coach Carol Hutchins tells 
each freshman the same thing 
when they set foot on campus.
“Leave the program better 
than you found it.”
When 
the 
current 
upperclassmen first arrived in 
Ann Arbor, there wasn’t much 
to 
improve. 
Michigan 
had 
consistently been ranked in the 
top-10 and was graced by the 
presence of 2016 National Player 
of the Year Sierra Romero.
It’s been three years now 
since 
Romero 
graduated 
— 
the program has struggled to 
reach such heights since. And 
Hutchins thinks it’s incumbent 
on the upperclassmen to help 
bridge that gap.
Junior 
Madison 
Uden 
is 
one of those upperclassmen 
Hutchins thought she’d be able 
to count on.
After a breakout year when 
she was second in batting 
average for the Wolverines, the 
third baseman was primed to 
lead the team both on and off 

the field. As one of the team’s 
captains, 
Uden 
started 
the 
first weekend in the heart of 
the lineup, batting somewhere 
between 
third 
and 
fifth. 
Expected to drive in runs and 
be one of the anchors on the 
offensive side of the ball, Uden 
has done the exact opposite.
Across nine games, Uden 
has had a lackluster hitting 
performance, 
going 
4-for-21 
with one run-batted-in and no 
extra-base hits — giving her a 
spot in the dugout instead of the 
lineup.
But Uden isn’t the only 
upperclassman in a slump.
“To be honest, we’re all 
kind of struggling,” said senior 
second baseman Faith Canfield. 
“But let me tell you, (Uden’s) 
supporting the team the way she 
needs to be. She’s all in, the way 
she needs to be even if she’s not 
starting.”
Canfield, who led the team in 
batting average and doubles last 
season, is yet to have an extra-
base hit this season. On top of 
that, senior outfielder Natalie 
Peters is a mundane 5-for-22 

in the box while senior first 
baseman Alex Sobczak has hit 
her way out of the starting first 
base position, batting .125 in 
five games.
“You know you have to 
rely 
on 
the 
experience 
of 
your 
upperclassmen 
because 
the 
underclassmen 
have 
to 
learn how to handle this pace 
and intensity of the game,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“I’d 
like 
a 
little more certainty from our 
upperclassmen. They know not 
only what this field battle is 
about but they understand how 
to play at this level.
“We need them to walk on 
the field every day, and I’d like 
everybody on our team to walk 
on the field, with authority and 
we’ve been a little uncertain 
and it shows.”
The lack of veteran leadership 
isn’t just limited to the hitting 
positions, however. Sophomore 
left-hander 
— 
and 
most 
experienced pitcher — Meghan 
Beaubien has had her fair share 
of struggles as well.
After 
bursting 
onto 
the 
collegiate scene with an earned 
run average of 1.16, an atrocious 
performance in Chapel Hill this 
past weekend has her ERA at a 
3.00 with only one win on the 
year.
One veteran, however, that 
has been piling up the box 
score is senior catcher Katie 
Alexander. After just five home 
runs in her junior season, 
Alexander has three thus far.
More importantly, Alexander 
is molding into the leader 
Hutchins wants to see out of her 
experienced players.
“On the field, (Alexander) is 
a beast,” Hutchins said. “She’s 
been in a stalwart for us, I’ve 
been really pleased. I really 
liked her best probably this past 
Sunday because she was mad.
“She’s one of the nicest 
people you’ll ever meet. She’s a 
great teammate, her teammates 
love her. She’s a nice kid. But on 
the field, she wants to beat you. 
And that’s the kind of kid I want 

on the field.”
Right now, Michigan has no 
reason to panic. There are at 
least 47 games – if not more – 

for the team to turn it around. 
The veterans know that. And 
if there’s any chance for the 
leaders of this team to leave the 

program better than they found 
it, they all know it’s going to 
start with them.
Time is ticking.

On the day George G. Gannon 
got married, he didn’t wear a 
wedding ring. Instead, he simply 
turned his University class of 
1952 ring around on his finger; 
silver band on the outside, 
ostentatious blue sapphire facing 
the palm. Real classy, grandpa.
But then again, as a newly 
minted Wolverine myself, such an 
incident is rather unsurprising. 
School spirit has always been the 
University of Michigan’s most 
prized commodity. Or, at least 
that’s the excuse my grandfather 
used to defend his slightly 
unconventional tastes. We — the 
students of the 21st century — 
might instead chalk that up to 
“The Michigan Difference” in all 
it’s beautiful simplicity. Leave it 
to a Michigan Wolverine to forgo 
a ring on their wedding day in 
favor of their class ring. What 
romantics we Wolverines are. 
As 
a 
child, 
I 
can 
still 
vividly remember holding my 
grandfather’s 
wrinkled, 
soft 
hand in my small, chubby fingers. 
And oh, how I loved to play with 
his class ring. I would roll the 
ring round and round his finger, 
and peer into that sapphire, 
imagining that I could fall right 
into it’s blue, mysterious depths. 
I know every facet carved into 
the stone as well as I know 
the words to John Denver’s 
“Country Roads” or the menu at 
Ann Arbor’s local coffee haunt, 
Espresso Royale. 
Back then, his hands seemed 
so big and strong, despite being 

weathered with age. Even now, 
though his hands are no longer as 
steady, warmth and reassurance 
still oozes from his grip. When I 
take his hand in mine, strolling 
down our familiar and beaten 
Brooklyn 
paths, 
the 
world 
stops turning for a few restful 
moments. 
Two 
partners 
in 
crime, 
nothing was beyond us. Whether 
it was ice cream with dulce de 
leche sauce for breakfast or 
giggling incessantly in the back 
rows of church (during mass, to 
my mother’s horror), trouble was 
our shared manifesto. A self-
proclaimed “tough guy,” I had 
him wrapped around my little, 
chubby fingers. 
Thick as thieves as we were 
— and still are — it should have 
been no surprise to anyone that 
the University of Michigan is 
where I would find myself a 
second home. Where I went, my 
jiddee – my grandfather – would 
always follow.
And I always thought I knew 
my grandfather well. Among 
my family, I’ve always been 
incredibly close to him. From 
confiding in him about failed 
tests, discussing the complexities 
of literature and film or even 
gossiping about boys (George 
Gannon’s pro-date tip is to grab 
some “soda-pop” or a malt at the 
local diner), nothing was ever a 
secret between us. 
Even the things left unspoken, 
we still understood. As my 
grandfather 
grew 
older, 
his 
health declined. Conversations 
cut 
short 
with 
excuses 
of 
exhaustion, 
and 
a 
softly 
exhaled “I’m fine” never truly 

deceived me of my grandfather’s 
difficulties. 
I 
implicitly 
understood everything looming 
behind the silence.
Now, 
the 
years 
separate 
us, and so, too, does a new, 
unfamiliar 
distance 
gape 
between us. Yet, since stepping 
foot in Ann Arbor, I feel that 
I have never understood my 
grandfather more. I have never 
felt closer to him than I do now.
As I walk along the streets 
of Ann Arbor, with its the 
pothole 
littered 
streets 
and 
lamp-lit sidewalks, everything 
is strangely familiar. As I lay 
on the lawn of the Diag during 
Michigan’s half-hearted attempt 
at spring or fall, or as I plod 
heavy-footed along snow banked 
paths, I feel torn between a 
thousand different moments, a 
million different lifetimes.
Every day, I wake up bleary-
eyed in a dark dorm room. The 
sun not yet risen from winter’s 
darkness; the room muggy and 
hot from a heater on full blast. 
Every day, I trod, unbalanced, 
down the hall to the bathroom. 
Every day, I ungracefully pull on 
layers on layers to bundle against 
the warmth.
Sometimes, I stop, and I think. 
I think, for a brief moment, of 
my grandfather. I think of how 
he once lived in the very same 
dorm as I did, all those years 
ago. I sit, and I wonder: Did we 
have similar morning routines? 
Stumbling from his bed, pulling 
on his shirt backwards, hair 
sticking up awkwardly like my 
own curly mane? I did inherit 
my dark curls, bushy and thick, 
from him and my ancestors from 

Lebanon. Did he slink down the 
hallway at the crack of dawn and 
blanket himself in coarse layers 
to protect against the cold?
Sometimes, I can almost see 
him walking beside me. I’ll sling 
my leather messenger bag over 
my shoulder, careen out the 
door in a bundle of scarves and 
sweaters and flying papers — and 
there he is, walking beside me. 
An ever-changing collage of old 
photos, my mind sloppily piecing 
together an indecisive image of 
my grandfather in his college 
days. 
Often, I am too sleep-deprived 
and frantic in my rush to class 
to acknowledge this ghost that 
walks with me. But together, on 
sleepy mornings, we walk into 
the cold together. And with a 
gush of February wind, he’s gone 
again. 
On Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday mornings, I work the 
morning caffeine rush at Bert’s. 
I’m always all-smiles, sing-song 
small talk and an array of self-
deprecating jokes about exams 
and the cold. The café, always 
busy, is a buzz of warm chatter, 
pierced by the shrill cry of the 
espresso machine, the smell of 
roasting coffee hanging heavy in 
the air. 
As 
I 
bustle 
to 
and 
fro, 
mopping, 
scooping, 
dashing, 
chatting, I think. I think, again, 
of my grandfather. I think of how 
he worked, too, in college. I think 
of how he grew up scurrying 
around the family grocery as a 
child in Detroit; I think of how 
he worked as a chef for a sorority 
on campus, making ends meet 
with the same brand of hustle 
and bustle I do three mornings 
a week. I wonder if he joked 
with coworkers and gossiped in 
between customer orders, like I 
do. I wonder if he turned some 
of the famous Gannon charm on 
some of the girls he served — just 
like I throw in a playful wink to 
passerbys, or jokingly write my 
number on the rim of a coffee 
cup when friends float by. 
Sometimes, as I lean against 
the 
counter, 
hands 
braced 
behind me and huffing oh-so-
slightly from my endless stream 
of small-talk, I see him there 
with me. We slyly nudge our hats 
off our heads, combing fingers 
through our hair in an effort to 
revive flattened curls — Gannons 
have never been hat people. Of 
course, in lieu of a gray T-shirt 
and baseball cap, my familiar 
ghost 
wears 
a 
more 
1950s 
characteristic button down, and 
trousers belted at the waist, with 
what my mind fancies to be a 
funny-looking paper-boat hat. 
Then, the peace is broken by 
a new wave of customers. The 
line seemingly without end, like 
a cruel, impossible bonus-level 
of a video game. I’ll whip my cap 
back on with a wince and quick 

prayer for my hair, and step up to 
plate at the register — my ghost 
disappears. 
On Wednesdays, I go out 
dancing — swing dancing, to 
be 
precise. 
Dancing 
around 
the ballrooms in the Michigan 
League, spinning on the balls of 
my feet and kicking up my skirts, 
it’s as if I’ve fallen through time. 
From the vintage fashion proudly 
shown off by fellow dancers 
and the classic jazzy tunes of 
the ’20s, ’30s and ’40s to the 
old-fashioned wood floors and 
panelling of the ballroom, the 
evening is suspended between 
eras. 
As I stumble though my 
swing-outs in a botched version 
of the Lindy Hop, I think of my 
grandfather. I think of how he, 
too, used to dance swing on 
campus — maybe even in the 
very same ballrooms. I think 
of how he’d frugally save his 
pocket money — just enough for 
a date, he always tells me, just 
enough to take a nice girl out 
for the night. I think of how he 
might have come dancing, weary 
and tired from hours of classes 
and work; I wonder if he felt 
the same burst of energy, the 
same jittery excitement to dance 
when the music starts to play as 
I do. Yes, he would have. He still 
does, even though his knees no 
longer let him join the dancing 
fray. My grandfather has always 
loved music with all his heart. 
I imagine that just like me he 
would have been content to never 
let his feet leave the dance floor.
Some things are different, of 
course. Back then, I imagine, 
they might’ve had a band playing 
through the night, rather than 
Spotify hooked up to speakers. 
I imagine students might have 
dressed up for the night out; I 
imagine that going out dancing 
was the big night of the week. 
I think of how I might have fit 
in well, with that crowd from 
the ’50s, as I dance away my 
Wednesday night in well-loved, 
second-hand red heels and a 
bright orange flouncy skirt. 
Sometimes, I imagine that 
it’s my grandfather I’m dancing 
with instead. I close my eyes, 
and for a moment 2019 slips away 
— the music and the movement 
takes over. Together, we dance 
for a moment in a timeless 
bubble, neither in my time, nor 
in his. He always said he wanted 
to teach me to dance. I imagine 
that it’s my grandfather coaching 
me though the fast kicks of the 
Charleston. We may never be 
able to dance together in real 
life, but I can have this moment.
Later, as midnight closes in, 
I’ll triple-step my way across the 
softly illuminated diag. I’ll dance 
playfully, teasingly around the 
block M. I’ll tip-toe across the 
stone benches, swing along the 
steps of Hatcher, and twirl my 

way past Angell. I revel in the 
intimacy of the night. This dark, 
unknown world after sunset 
that seemingly only I know — 
here, I dance across more than 
a century of precious dreams 
gifted by The Sandman. In the 
quiet of the evening, I hear the 
buzz of activity of students 
from years — from eras — gone 
by. Lover’s embrace under the 
engineering arch, friends scurry 
from the library, dancers, like 
me, blissfully straggle home. 
This 
moonlight 
world 
is 
the collision of timelines. The 
entirety of campus, of Ann Arbor 
itself, is steeped in nostalgia. 
The city is practically dripping 
in 
memories 
— 
good, 
bad, 
beautiful and ugly. It is easy to 
reminiscence when gazing at the 
block M, sitting in the Michigan 
Theater, or walking through 
the Michigan League. But the 
truth is, these memories are 
everywhere. One only has to slip 
beneath the thinly veiled surface 
to find these carefully nurtured 
moments and lifetimes.
Thousands of students before 
us 
have 
walked 
along 
our 
campus. Thousands have filtered 
through these very same halls, 
trudged 
stubbornly 
through 
snow-storms, 
and 
dragged 
themselves 
through 
exam 
seasons. Just because they leave 
does not mean their presence is 
no longer felt. Rather, I imagine 
that within the very foundations 
of 
the 
University 
lie 
the 
experiences of these travellers 
who have passed through and 
beyond Michigan’s walls. 
I 
often 
reach 
into 
this 
veil, beyond the demanding 
excitement of the everyday to 
the depths of the past. It’s true 
that one should not dwell too 
long on what has happened, 
and instead look to the future, 
but for me, it has provided 
comfort. My grandfather, who 
I love unconditionally, is now 
more than that — more than 
a “grandfather.” As silly and 
obvious as it may seem, he is 
also a person, one who I finally 
have had the pleasure to become 
acquainted with. By accessing 
the well of memories held within 
the heart of the University 
and its campus, I have come to 
understand and identify with my 
grandfather, George G. Gannon, 
so much more. I have come to 
understand, as cliche as it is, 
what it means to be a Wolverine.
Now, when my byline prints 
“Madeleine Virginia Gannon,” 
I bring those memories — that 
nostalgia — with me. I invoke 
the memory of my grandfather, 
of the Gannon name, in every 
article I write. I add to this 
collection of memories with 
every morning I wake up to the 
Ann Arbor sunrise, and every 
night I fall asleep to that clear 
and bright Michigan moon.

Inheriting the Wolverine 
name across generations

MADELEINE GANNON
Daily Arts Writer

MADELEINE VIRGINIA GANNON / DAILY

B-SIDE SECONDARY

The sign, “Ann Arbor: A Book 
Lover’s Town,” is located on 
the corner of N. University and 
State St., right across the street 
from Walgreens. After pointing 
out the sign to a number of 
people in the course of the past 
week and a half, I realized that 
it hides: In its inert position and 
monochromic 
color 
scheme, 
“Ann 
Arbor: 
A 
Booklover’s 
Town” remains tucked away 
from prying, curious eyes. I 
picture students and workers 
hurrying 
past, 
their 
heads 
down, focused on their phones 

or their Airpods in, lost in 
Ariana Grande’s “NASA.” It’s 
an iterance of go, go, go. There’s 
not enough time to stop and 
observe. It makes sense. After 
all, they’re not tourists.
I remember standing right in 
front of that sign, donned in a 
charcoal coat, a polka-dotted 
blouse and red lipstick. My 
coat, which had once served me 
well for my 37-second trek from 
my Honda Accord to my high 
school in Nebraska, didn’t fare 
well in the Michigan winter. 
I was flanked by my parents 
and siblings, with my mother 
urging, impatient and cold, to 
go inside and eat.
“Yallah, Sarah. Yallah,” she 

called out, holding the door to 
Mama Satto’s half open. “We’re 
hungry.” I had just enough time 
to read the last line: Borders is 
opening on Main Street. Next 
to it, a shot from 2011, when 
Borders 
closed, 
bittersweet. 
I snapped a picture, my nails 
chipped and fingers bit by 
the 
cold, 
collecting 
quirky 
pictures of the University and 
Ann Arbor like they were rare 
Pokémon cards. In my arsenal, 
I had more than 20 pictures 
of the Law Quad, including a 
scribble of stick figures on the 
edge of the wall — aesthetic, I 
thought — and, of course, the 
quintessential 
photographs 
in the entry of Nickels Arcade 

and under the sign of the 
State Theater, “Howl’s Moving 
Castle.” If I wasn’t already 
endeared enough to Ann Arbor, 
“Howl’s Moving Castle” was 
that final proverbial brick. Ann 
Arbor’s history with books 
was just the cherry on top. It’s 
true — in my college search, 
outside of Niche and U.S. News 
& World Report, I’ve spent 
an 
embarrassingly 
long 
time 
looking 
at 
websites 
that 
ranked 
the 
best 
college 
libraries. 
The Michigan Law 
Library 
appeared 
every time, and I 
added 
an 
asterisk 
beside the University 
of Michigan to signal 
its edge.
I was rearranging 
the photos in my 
head, 
planning 
which ones to post or 
make into a collage 
on Instagram (this 
was the time before 
Instagram 
had 
the option to add 
multiple pictures at 
once). I knew what 
I was going to say, 
my college hopping 
coming to a close: 
I’m ready to be a 
Michigan Wolverine.
Flash-forward 
four 
years 
and 
Ann Arbor is like a 
revolving door with books: Each 
year it seemed as if another one 
would exit, and in its place, 
something else will arrive. 
Infatuated with the crinkly 
feel of used books and the 
dusty, dreamlike atmosphere 

of bookshops, I had coaxed 
my friend Katherine the year 
before, another bibliophile, to 
go bookstore hopping with me.
“It 
would 
be 
like 
an 
exploration 
of 
Ann 
Arbor 
itself!” I enthused. I wrote 
a list of all the book-stores 
in the area, including a few 
unconventional ones like Crazy 
Wisdom 
Bookstore 
& 
Tea 

Room, Vault of Midnight, Aunt 
Agatha and even the Ann Arbor 
public library. I was amazed 
at the specificity of books, and 
how so many of my favorite 
things — coffee, books and 
cats — could exist in the same 

space. And no book-voyage 
is complete without a trip to 
Dawn Treader — Its outside 
book-display is a staple in my 
memories of Michigan and 
Ann Arbor. When I ventured 
to Aunt Agatha’s the next fall 
in a quest to find Christie’s 
“ABC Murders,” however, I was 
shocked to find that the store 
was permanently closed. It was 
a signal of the ever-
changing landscape 
of Ann Arbor and 
books, 
paving 
the 
space for something 
new.
The 
very 
first 
sentence 
from 
the 
sign on the corner 
of 
N. 
University 
and State St. reads: 
“Ann Arborites have 
always bought books, 
borrowed 
books 
and 
had 
private 
libraries.”
And 
even 
with 
the heavy loss of a 
bookstore. Whether 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Library Association 
in 1838, Borders in 
2011 or Aunt Agatha’s 
in 2018, Ann Arbor 
has always had and 
always will continue 
to have a dedicated 
relationship 
with 
books. Even though 
the bookstores may 
leave, the books stay.
Now, almost exactly four 
years later, I’m snapping the 
same photo. And despite my 
new winter coat and new life 
experiences elbow-deep into 
college, my relationship with 
books has remained.

spurs Wolverines down the stretch

With the clock running down 
and Maryland facing a 10-point 
deficit, Anthony Cowan grabbed 
Zavier Simpson. The whistle 
blew.
Cowan was playing hack-
a-Simpson, assuming that the 
junior guard — a notoriously poor 
free-throw shooter — would miss, 
giving the Terrapins an extra 
possession.
But Simpson no longer fits 
his reputation. In Big Ten play, 
Simpson has hit 22-of-28 from 
the charity stripe — a 76 percent 
clip. And against Maryland, he 
continued the trend, sinking 
both free throws to extend the 
Michigan men’s basketball team’s 
lead.
Cowan didn’t try his luck 
again.
“It’s a long way from last 
year, where it was hard for him 
to find the bucket and the free-
throw line,” said sophomore 
forward Isaiah Livers. “Now he’s 
one of our late-game — I think 
everybody 
— 
nobody 
minds 
Zavier getting the ball.”
It goes beyond just Simpson. 
Redshirt junior wing Charles 
Matthews and junior center 
Jon Teske — 58 and 57 percent 

shooters 
in 
their 
careers, 
respectively — are both up to 63 
percent in conference play.
Teske, Matthews and Simpson 
are the Wolverines’ three best 
defenders as well — making them 
vital to have on the court down 
the stretch. But in prior months, 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
faced the choice of removing 
them and losing their defense 
or keeping them and giving 
opponents the opportunity to 
take advantage. In that sense, the 
teamwide improvement has paid 
dividends in more ways than one.
***
Last season — in which the 
Wolverines shot just 66 percent 
— proved by far the worst free-
throw shooting team in Beilein’s 
tenure. Because of that, Beilein 
decided from the beginning that 
foul shots needed a renewed 
focus.
“We’re practicing it more,” 
Beilein said at the team’s media 
day on Oct. 22. “It’s been a thing 
that we’ve taken for granted 
because we had so many good foul 
shooters that we didn’t practice it 
as much. We probably practice it 
500 percent more knowing that 
they need to do that.”
Players who miss from the 
stripe during games — from key 
members of the rotation to walk-

ons — stay after practice the next 
day to shoot 15 to 20 free throws. 
Beilein 
has 
also 
stressed 
the mental side of things. He’s 
introduced the team to meditation 
and visualization exercises. The 
night before a game, he instructs 
players to picture themselves 
getting to the line and draining 
the shot so that during the actual 
thing, they’ll have the confidence 
to actually make it happen. 
These new practices, along with 
more experience, have paid off. 
Michigan is shooting 75 percent 
from the stripe in Big Ten play.
“A lot of hard work has really 
helped with it,” Beilein said. 
“When you get on the big stage 
and you’ve gotta make those free 
throws and you’re all alone out 
there, you sorta get used to it.”
That’s certainly been true of 
Simpson. Early on in the season, 
he wouldn’t indulge reporters’ 
questions about his foul shooting, 
viewing them as slights to his 
ability. But with his numbers 
now, the only inquiries he has to 
face are about his improvement 
— and about how his free throws 
have helped down the stretch, not 
hurt.
“I feel like it was all mental,” 
Simpson said after the game 
against the Terrapins. “ … Not 
being a great free throw shooter 
last year, you can capitalize your 
weaknesses and that’s what I did. 
Hopefully, it can continue, but at 
the same time, I’m gonna keep 
working.”
Last year, teams knew they 
could foul Michigan at the end of 
games, daring the Wolverines to 
make or break the contest from 
the line.
But this year, a more common 
sight 
is 
what 
happened 
on 
Saturday: The opposing team 
tries, but Michigan calmly sinks 
each free throw.
Then, the dare goes back to the 
other team: Do they want to risk 
trying it again?
Often, they don’t.

Pastujov reflects on growth this year

In his third season with the 
Michigan hockey team, junior 
forward Nick Pastujov has started 
piecing together the elements of 
his game.
The Florida-native has put forth 
career-high numbers in goals 
and points – notching 10 and 20, 
respectively, with four games still 
remaining in the regular season. 
He began the year with a three-
game goal streak and surpassed 
his previous career high of four 
goals after just 10 games.
Pastujov 
has 
quietly 
put 
together 
his 
most 
complete 
season to date. So quietly that 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
was unaware of his current goal-
scoring drought – one that dates 
back to the championship game 
of the Great Lakes Invitational 
Tournament.
“I hadn’t realized that he hasn’t 
scored because his play hasn’t 
diminished,” Pearson said. “He’s 
continued to play well, and you 
can play well and not necessarily 
score goals.”
After recording just one and 
four goals, respectively, in his first 
two seasons with the Wolverines, 
his 10 goals through 30 games may 
have come as a surprise to some. 
But for Pastujov, it is a part of his 

game that he felt was previously 
there.
“Well 
before 
I 
came 
to 
Michigan I kind of was producing 
a lot with Team USA,” Pastujov 
said. 
“I 
think 
through 
two 
shoulder surgeries and becoming a 
freshman that kind of knocked my 
confidence back and that’s when 
kind of the production stopped. 
But then kind of getting back to 
how I felt like before, like feeling 
confident again, I think in those 
first two years I really got a chance 
to round out my defensive game.”
His goal drought may have gone 
unnoticed because of the other 
things Pastujov does on the ice. 
Whether it’s clogging up the area 
in front of the net or showing off 
the defensive skills he developed 
over his first two seasons, they 
are all pieces of his game that are 
coming together.
But that goal production could 
easily be much higher, too.
In the first period against 
Penn State on Jan. 26, Pastujov 
had three shot attempts strike 
iron and one later in the game 
for good measure. Add in a 
couple unfortunate bounces in 
Minneapolis against the Golden 
Gophers on plays that prevented 
Pastujov from scoring — including 
a point-blank open net miss in 
the 4-3 loss and a game in which 
he set his season-high with seven 

shots — and you’d be looking at 
Michigan’s leader in goals.
It is a hypothetical scenario 
but all just to say that the scoring 
opportunities are still coming for 
Pastujov. Through the first half 
of the season, the goals followed. 
But now, despite the number in 
the goal scoring column staying 
stagnant, his play and the play of 
those around him has not.
“He’s making players around 
him better,” Pearson said. “And 
that’s the thing that he’s done 
even though he’s not scoring. 
He’s making good plays for the 
guys who are scoring, whether it’s 
(Jack) Becker or (Will) Lockwood 
or whoever he may be with.”
Lockwood, Pastujov and Becker 
have been on a line together since 
the series at Columbus on Jan. 11.
Since then, Lockwood has 
recorded eight goals in those last 
nine games — perhaps a testament 
to the elevated play of Pastujov. 
And though the goals are not 
coming for Becker, aside from the 
pair he had against Michigan State 
on Feb. 8, he is fourth on the team 
with 84 shots behind Lockwood, 
junior Jake Slaker and Pastujov, 
meaning that the opportunities 
are coming for the linemates.
For Pastujov, though, even now 
that the goals are finally coming in 
his third season, it is about more 
than finding the back of the net.

Brienne Minor is ready for her final chapter

Donning 
a 
gray 
sweatsuit, 
Brienne Minor stood draped over 
a railing next to the court and 
watched. There was the occasional 
cheer, a passing conversation here, 
a word of encouragement there. 
But mostly, just silence.
It was the Michigan Invitational 
— the final exhibition tune-up for 
the Michigan women’s tennis team 
on Jan. 21 — and Minor was sitting 
out the singles round.
Precautionary reasons?
“Mhmm. She’s good. She’s 
fine,” said Michigan coach Ronni 
Bernstein, tentatively. “… Not 
overdoing it with her.”
It’s been 20 months now since 
Minor watched a forehand return 
from Florida’s Belinda Woolcock 
sail long, flung her racket in the air, 
clenched her fists and cemented 
her place in history. The first 
Michigan woman — and the first 
Black woman — to win the NCAA 
singles title. From unseeded fairy 
tale to national narrative in the 
blink of an eye. Twenty months 
since reaching the apex of her 
sport. Twenty months that might 
now feel more like 20 years.
“I just like kind of, at the end of 
it, I just couldn’t really believe that 
it happened,” Minor told The Daily 
last week. “... I just remember I felt 
really relaxed that week. I was just 
having fun, and it was like some of 
the best tennis I’ve played.”
Her rise was chronicled in the 
New York Times, Washington Post 
and The Michigan Daily, among 
others. It’s one of tremendous 
athletic 
achievement 
— 
a 
supernova hot streak, a historic 
week, a generational achievement.
It is the centrality of Minor’s 
story, but it is not the final chapter. 
Minor, then a sophomore, played in 
the US Open. She handled droves 
of media requests and a sudden 
influx of fame. And she did it all 
before the age of 20. But, with two 
years of school left and no desire 
to tempt professional fate just yet, 
Minor had to face a question as 
bewildering as it was simple.

What next?
The predicament is inherently 
front-facing, an unnatural vantage 
point for Minor. The thing to 
understand about Brienne Minor 
is that, even as she reached the 
pinnacle of her sport, etched her 
name in the throes of Michigan 
lore, ascended to stardom, it was 
never about her.
Nor was it about her when those 
fortunes flipped.
***
It was early March 2018 when 
Brienne Minor dialed the phone.
This was not what her junior 
season was supposed to look like, 
and she knew it. Those around 
her had insisted she would emerge 
from knee surgery in the summer 
of 2017 stronger. But as the pain 
persisted, frustration festered. She 
went nearly two months without 
registering a singles win to start 
the season.
This was far from Minor’s first 
encounter with knee issues. She 
has battled patellar tendinitis in 
both knees for much of her playing 
career. It has loomed menacingly 
in the subtext of her career; an 
injury which demands rest, for an 
athlete naturally resistant to it.
Minor 
had 
surgery after the 
2017 season and 
sat out the fall of 
the 2018 season to 
ensure, she hoped, 
a 
full 
recovery. 
But 
when 
that 
promised 
full 
recovery 
never 
truly came, unease 
grew.
“The 
pain 
got to a certain 
point 
where 
it 
was 
constantly 
on 
her 
mind 
and 
constantly 
affecting 
her 
matches,” 
said 
Ronit Yurovsky, a 
former teammate 
and now-volunteer 
assistant coach for 
the 
Wolverines. 
“But I think with 

that being said, there’s a little bit 
more of a mental side to it as well.”
That toll manifested itself on the 
court, where the reigning NCAA 
Singles Champion went several 
months without winning a singles 
match. And the pressure of that 
inescapable pedestal — reigning 
NCAA Singles Champion — did 
her no favors.
“I was just really sad all the time 
that I couldn’t get it done for my 
team,” Minor said. “Over and over 
again.”
In the midst of that drought, 
Minor turned to Yurovsky. The 
two have talked frequently since 
they were teammates in 2016. 
During Minor’s improbable run 
in 2017, Yurovsky insisted she take 
an ice bath after the first night to 
minimize wear and tear during the 
grueling week. “And Bri hates ice 
baths,” Yurovsky said. “It’s one of 
the things she absolutely dreads.” 
It became a rite of superstition — 
reluctantly climbing in the cold 
tub night after night if for no other 
reason than she’d done it the night 
before.
But this time around, the 
problem was more complex. And 
the answer couldn’t be chalked up 

to superstition.
“I just tried to let her know that 
it’s OK, you know,” Yurovsky said. 
“Just because now you have this 
added pressure, it doesn’t mean 
that it’s not OK to lose here and 
there. It’s just sort of how you’re 
able to get through it. And I told 
her that it just takes one or two 
when you get your confidence 
back.”
Minor 
considers 
that 
conversation a turning point in her 
senior season. She notched a 6-2, 
6-1 win over Iowa’s Zoe Douglas 
on Mar. 16, her first singles victory 
of the year. She then followed it up 
with three more straight-set wins 
to re-calibrate her season and, 
perhaps, more than that.
Minor finished the year 11-7 
in 
singles 
matches, 
including 
8-1 in Big Ten action. She also 
was 
instrumental 
in 
helping 
lead the Wolverines to a Big Ten 
Tournament title, just the second 
in program history.
But her return to winning ways 
served more as a Band-Aid to the 
issues still beneath the surface. 
Asked whether she felt 100 percent 
at any point last season, Minor 
does not hesitate.

“Uh, no,” Minor said, “because 
after my procedures the pain still 
came back in my knees. So I was 
definitely never physically 100 
percent.”
What about now?
“Nope, definitely not.”
She will have knee surgery 
in the offseason, and perhaps 
in a different context — or for a 
different athlete — she would get 
the surgery done now. For Minor, 
that is not a consideration.
But Minor details the minutiae 
of her injuries and struggles with 
an upbeat tone. Were it not for the 
words coming out of her mouth, it 
would seem just as plausible she 
was sharing her favorite memories 
from that week in Athens, Ga.
Not an ounce of regret. Not a 
hint of fear. Just a constant, bright 
smile.
***
So, here is Brienne Minor, 
20 months removed from a life-
altering achievement, sitting in 
an office, neither effusive of her 
past nor daunted by her uncertain 
future. She is not tethered to her 
achievements nor unraveled by 
any of the misfortune. Just Bri to 
most. Bri-yonce, to some.
Perhaps 
that’s 
simply a fortune 
Minor has earned. 
Her story comes 
with the inherent 
security 
blanket 
of 
permanence. 
Minor 
has 
accomplished 
more in her 21 
years 
on 
earth 
than most ever 
will; and it’s basic 
human 
nature 
— to a degree — 
to rest on those 
laurels. At least, 
that’s how most 
would see it.
Those 
closest 
to 
her 
would 
undoubtedly 
resist that kind 
of 
egotistical 
framing.
“She 
is 
very 

much herself at all times, which is, 
on one hand, just so remarkable,” 
said Mira Rudor-Hook, Minor’s 
doubles teammate for two seasons. 
“We all go through phases of just 
self-doubt — she also had just a 
lot of expectations on her. And, 
honestly, I felt like she actually 
navigated that very, very well. And 
it also made a massive impact on 
our team.
“We all knew she was coming 
back from that and we now had a 
national champion on our team. 
Day-in, day-out, she’s just so 
humble, it does massive things to 
just how we all interact together. I 
would say I didn’t see a difference, 
honestly. I would just be like that’s 
Bri — whether she wins a national 
title or doesn’t.”
What comes of the twilight of 
Minor’s college career is yet to be 
seen — and not entirely up to her. 
She is playing through the pain 
that remains; and so far, doing so 
quite capably, posting a 3-0 singles 
record in the early going of the 
spring season.
She has professional aspirations 
and, the health of her knees 
permitting, has the talent reach 
them.
Ask her, though, and she’ll 
choose 
to 
emphasize 
the 
importance of her role as a senior 
leader on a team brimming with 
potential, currently ranked 13th 
in the nation. And her goals lie 
squarely in team success.
“I definitely want (the team) to 
win the Big Ten Tournament and 
then also go far in NCAAs,” Minor 
said. “Obviously the goal is to win 
it, but, you know, baby steps.”
“I don’t know, I just want her to 
enjoy it,” Rudor-Hook added, on 
her hopes for Minor. “Like to enjoy 
the girls and the team and to give 
herself the credit that she deserves 
to be honest.”
For Minor, this senior season 
rests on striking that balance. She 
cares about the tangible, and what 
more can be obtained for herself 
and 
her 
teammates. 
Perhaps 
equally important, particularly 
to those around her, though, is 
appreciating what’s already there.

What is nostalgia, exactly? 
Rooted in the past, this feeling 
of longing can often bombard 
us when we’re watching old 
shows (“Kim Possible,” anyone?), 
flipping through old photos or 
even just taking a bite of a chicken 
nugget. 
In 
2016, 
Scientific 
American 
reported 
on 
the 
positive effects of reminiscence, 
stating that nostalgia “boosted 
self-continuity by increasing a 
sense of social connectedness.” 
In other words, remembering a 
common past, whether with our 
family, our friends or a complete 
stranger, is reassuring — it 
shows us we weren’t alone in our 
strange childhood obsessions or 
moments of vulnerability at any 
point in time.
It makes sense, then, that 
NPR’s “The Moth” has remained 
so popular over the last 20 years. 
Starting in 1997 New York, “The 
Moth” has captivated audiences 
at events around the country, 
drawing all kinds of people 
together by sharing both stories 
and intimate experiences. The 
show should be the poster child 
for nostalgia — the stories that 
hit the stage are rife with the 
feelings and connection that 
so many of us are missing, 
especially in today’s digital age.
Jennifer Hixson, a senior 
director at “The Moth” for 
almost 20 years, discussed this 
need when she said “it’s just fun 
to hear something straight from 
a human being — unfiltered, 
unmessed with, unedited and 
just straightforward. Right from 
a person, I guess that’s it, just 
human 
connection.” 
Hixson 
speaks from experience: She has 
worked with “The Moth” since 
the beginning, producing the 
beloved “Moth” story slams that 
its audience has come to know 
and love.
Hixson helps storytellers take 
their experiences and turn them 
into entertainment. Nostalgia 
as a raw emotion is something 
powerful, but when crafted into 
a story and weaved throughout 
other 
feelings, 
it 
becomes 
a 
tool 
for 
connection 
and 
understanding. Instead of simply 
being a means of entertainment, 
it becomes a piece of art. 
When asked about the role of 
“The Moth” when it comes to 
spreading these stories, Hixson 
said, 
“We 
certainly 
provide 
people with platforms all over 
the country and I hope that we 

have contributed to storytelling 
being an art form … There have 
always been stories … but then 
the thought that wow, it’s kind 
of an artform and look I can do 
it. It’s an equal opportunity art 
form.”
Pursuing 
this 
equal 
opportunity art form, though, is 
still a journey. While storytellers 
may have an intense experience, 
they have to learn what details 
to include and how to end it. 
So, what actually makes a good 
story? Hixson emphasized the 
need for vulnerability within 
a story when describing its 
connective nature and how, 
despite the individuality of each 
of the stories showcased in “The 
Moth,” people everywhere can 
empathize and relate to the 
storyteller’s experience.
What does it say about us that, 
in order to connect with people, 
we need to see their weaknesses? 
Maybe it’s the age of social 
media and our constant need 
to compare ourselves to others. 
But stories have been around 
for ages, way before Instagram, 
Twitter and the like. What is it 
really about stories that makes 
us keep telling them?
In Hixson’s words, “it feels 
intimate to have someone tell you 
a story.” Stories are an unedited 
version of ourselves, oftentimes 
highlighting some of our lowest 
moments. The comparisons we 
make listening to these stories 
aren’t the same thing as scrolling 
through post after post after 
post. Instead, stories become “a 
really rich way to understand 
somebody else’s perspective. It’s 
much easier to picture yourself 
in someone else’s shoes when 
you hear the story coming right 
from them, you see what you 
have in common. They can take 
you places.”
And take you places they will. 
On Feb. 19, Ann Arbor hosted its 
own Moth event and people from 
all over the city came to watch 
and enjoy the stories. But we 
didn’t stay in Ann Arbor, nor did 
we even stay in the 21st century 
— the audience traveled from 
1997 Paris, following Princess 
Diana’s death, (almost) all the 
way to the astral plane and to a 
Texas lawn on a Sunday morning 
where wedding rings flew.
If you’ve never been to a Moth 
event, the basic breakdown is 
ten stories, from ten people 
(obviously). Each person, in 
theory, has five minutes to 
tell their story that in some 
way or form connects to the 
night’s theme (ours was flight). 

Afterwards, a set of judges 
(audience volunteers) give scores 
to each story, with the end goal of 
crowning a “winner” who will go 
on to tell their story at a “Grand 
Slam” with other winners from 
other events in various areas. Jim 
McCargar told of his experience 
riding high in the Goodyear 
blimp; the stakes weren’t terribly 
high (unless you count the very 
real possibility that he wouldn’t 
get the chance to go up), but his 
story carried that air of whimsy 
that we all seem to lose in the 
midst of midterms, job-hunting 
and other “life” things.
Joanna 
Courteau 
recalled 
her time at the University of 
Minnesota and a certain lab 
assistant who got a little too 
comfortable with a little too 
many students. She lamented 
“the wonderful love that might 
have been” but also recognized 
her escape from a “seduced and 
abandoned” fate. Kari Styles, on 
the other hand, brought us back 
to Texas, 1991 and a world where 
a woman’s duty was to have her 
husband’s baby. A gripping story 
with the vulnerability and stakes 
to match, Styles had captured 
the room and the tension was 
palpable. Courteau and Styles 
both told stories of relationships 
gone awry, but while the first 
was an endearing tale of her 
brush with “what might have 
been” the second story was the 
gold standard for what it means 
to take your life back.
Seeing what Hixson talked 
about 
in 
person 
was 
an 
unparalleled 
experience. 
Not 
only did I hear hilarious and 
fascinating stories, but I also 
received three business cards 
in one night. If I was there to 
network, I would have been 
proud of myself. I talked to all 
ten 
storytellers 
(some 
more 
than others) and while each 
interaction left me a bit more 
drained than the one before, it 
was exhilarating to see these 
people up close and hear more 
about their life and their stories.
Technology is great, but if I 
hadn’t left my laptop at home 
or turn my phone off during 
the event, I never would have 
learned:

1) Never play hide-and-go-
seek with demons.
2) There’s more to life than 
masturbating.

So, maybe saying we’re all 
starved for human connection is 
cliché, but does that make it any 
less true?

Capturing memories with 
‘The Moth’ in Ann Arbor

EMMA CHANG
Senior Arts Editor

CARTER FOX / DAILY

Art is steeped in nostalgia. 
One piece of art can have a 
million different memories for a 
million different people. Bruce 
Springsteen, “The Boss,” may not 
be the artist you’d expect to see in 
a student newspaper in 2019, but 
here he is. Springsteen is a rock 
‘n’ roll legend, one that is beloved 
and cherished — in vastly different 
ways — by two Daily Arts writers.

Bruce Springsteen and the 
spring of 2011

I’m Black. I’m female. I’m 
under 40. I have no ties to New 
Jersey other than an unwavering 
allegiance to Teresa Guidice, and 
yet I hold a strong passion for The 
Boss. As I compose this love letter 
to my favorite unexpected liberal, 
I am listening to “Hungry Heart” 
and being flooded with memories 
from the spring of 2011. Sixth 
grade … good times. I already 
know 
what 
you’re 
thinking: 
What buffoon listens to the Born 
in the U.S.A. album, an album 
explicit in its analysis of the 
struggles of Vietnam veterans, 
to be reminded of middle school? 
Especially when said buffoon did 
not attend middle school in 1984, 
but in 2011?
The answer is the buffoon 
whose piece you’re reading, and 
my justification is Pandora.
Although 
universally 
clowned now, there was a point 
in time when Pandora was the 
premiere music streaming app, 
and, arguably, an entire sub-
generation’s (1997-2000 babies, 
stand up!) musical sherpa. In fact, 
I attribute most of the foundations 
of my current musical tastes to 
Pandora’s all-knowing algorithm 
— which may or may not suspect is 
my guardian angel. How else can 
you explain being pointed in the 
direction of testosterone-fueled 
Springsteen from “Material Girl 
Radio,” a station overwhelmingly 
populated by the likes of queer 
and feminist icons like Donna 
Summer, 
Barbra 
Streisand, 
Culture Club, Joan Jett and 
Madonna? Yes, you could make 
the argument that the algorithm 
recognized I had an affinity for 
’80s music, and aptly suggested 
one of the biggest albums of the 
decade. BUT. Wouldn’t it be more 
fun to imagine a guardian angel 
working tirelessly to introduce 
11-year-old me to the discography 
of Bruce Springsteen?
I cannot remember exactly 
which Bruce Springsteen song I 
heard first chronologically, but I 
can remember the first song that 
made me stop and take notice of 
the weird album cover with some 
man’s tight ass on it: “Working on 
the Highway.” Again, odd that my 
gateway song into fandom was 
not even one of the many singles 
on Born in the U.S.A. that cracked 
the Billboard Top Ten, but then 
again, Bruce and I are not a 
conventional match — why would 
we would have a conventional 
meeting? 
“Working on the Highway” 
appealed to me then because 
it reminded me of summer, 
specifically the music I would 
hear on my day-long excursions 
to Six Flags Over Georgia. It was 
bright, cheerful, poppy and most 
importantly, had an overload of 
synthesizer. I didn’t yet have the 
language to express that I was a 
ho for synth-pop, but dear God, 
was I. It was only a matter of time 
before I found “Glory Days,” (a 
song with even more synthesizer), 
then the remaining singles off the 

album, then “Born to Run,” and 
soon, Bruce had a new fan. 
My sixth grade summer was 
still the best time in the universe, 
and the last spring months of 
school leading up to it were a close 
second. The days were longer, 
field day was on the horizon and 
by this point, parents and teachers 
had long-since given up the 
control they held in September. 
Also during this time, my club 
soccer team had practice. So 
three days a week, my father and 
I made the long, sun-soaked drive 
to the complex and the sweaty, 
grass-scented drive home. In the 
moment, I hated these drives, but 
of course, in hindsight, I have to 
appreciate them for providing 
me the time to be glued to 
Pandora and ultimately shaping 
my musical tastes. Excuse the 
tired platitude, but I would give 
anything to go back to our beat-
up Jeep Cherokee and hear 
“Hungry Heart” for the first time. 
That’s the beautiful thing about 
nostalgia. One song or one artist 
can completely bring you back to 
an entirely different time in your 
life that may not seem significant, 
but once you open Pandora’s box 
(pun fully intended), the obscure 
memories begin pouring in.
So thanks, Bruce — not just 
for refusing to let Republicans 
use your music — but for the 
memories of 2011.

I learned more from a three-
minute record than I ever 
learned in school

Unlike Ally, I do have ties to 
New Jersey. No, wait — more 
than ties. I have a visceral, deep, 
uncomparable 
love 
for 
New 
Jersey. The Garden State. The 
armpit of America. The most 
disrespected 
and 
underrated 
state in America. My home. I 
love everything about my state, 
from the near-death experiences 
on Route 22 to the fact that it is 
literally the only state you can 
order Taylor ham on a bagel and 
no one even thinks twice about 
it. I could write a novel on New 
Jersey — a modern Bible that 
would easily rival the works of 
Mark, Matthew, Luke and John 
in both relevance and notoriety. 
Instead I will dive into a single 
gospel, one that honors my God, 
my muse, my surrogate father: 
Bruce Springsteen.
I did not fall upon Springsteen 
by chance. In fact, it was the 
opposite of chance — I couldn’t 
avoid being a Springsteen fan 
if I tried. Every car ride with 
my parents was complemented 
by 
Springsteen’s 
words, 
overpowered only by my mother’s 
off-pitch 
scream-singing 
of 
them. I came out of the womb 
knowing every single word of 
his discography, my childhood 
soundtracked by the gruff yet 
poetic voice of The Boss.
There is not a single memory 
I have of New Jersey that 
cannot be matched with a Bruce 
Springsteen song. From Devil’s 
hockey wins punctuated by the 
banger-worthy synth of “Glory 
Days” to beach trips washed in the 
sunny glow of “Sherry Darling.” 
I have danced my heart out to 
“Rosalita” along with a crowd of 
baby boomers on a Jersey shore 
rooftop, and I have cried alone to 
the aching desperation of “Bobby 
Jean.”
My devotion to Bruce has 
grown alongside me. While as 

a child Bruce was an inevitable 
constant in my life, as an adult he 
has become a conscious choice. 
Listening to Bruce brings me 
back to my roots — to long drives 
on the parkway, bagel breakfasts 
in the morning and dance parties 
in the kitchen with my mom.
It would be a disservice to this 
story to not dedicate a section 
to my mother, for without her I 
would not be a Bruce fan. Both 
my parents were born and raised 
in Jersey, and yes, my father has 
his fair share of Bruce clout. But 
it is my mother whose devotion to 
her teenage idol has been passed 
on to me. She’s been to over 10 
Bruce Springsteen concerts, some 
as a rockin’ ’80s chick sneaking 
out of the house and some as 
an equally cool suburban mom 
staying true to her past. My first 
and only Bruce concert was with 
my mom in the summer of 2016, 
a climatic event we had been 
meaning to do together for years. 
The show lasted for four and a 
half hours in the steamy summer 
sun of New Jersey in August, 
standing bright and proud above 
the open air of Metlife Stadium. 
Bruce wove through the classics 
and surprised us with some 
bluesy deep cuts — all fantastic of 
course, but it was the end of the 
marathon of a concert that nearly 
brought me to tears.
As soon as Bruce brought out 
the harmonica, I knew it was 
happening. I turned to my mom 
and said the only two words 
either of us wanted to hear: 
“Thunder Road.” And “Thunder 
Road” it was. Bruce ripped into 
arguably his best song with 
intensity, but it was unmatched 
by the ecstacy of my mother and 
me. If you’ve never listened to 
“Thunder Road,” first of all, I’m 
sorry. Second of all, please for the 
love of Bruce listen to it, and you 
will feel changed.
Just as I thought the night was 
ending, Bruce decided to slap 
me across the face. He played 
“Jersey Girl,” a cover that has 
stripped Tom Waits of all rights 
to the original — this is Bruce’s 
song. As he crooned his love for 
a Jersey girl, Bruce invited a 
couple up on stage to slow dance. 
They proceeded to get engaged as 
Bruce burst into the final chorus 
and fireworks shot into the 
Meadowlands sky. If it feels like 
I’m vomiting these words up, it’s 
because I am — this was literally 
one of the best moments of my 
life.
All at once I saw my past, 
present and future. I saw myself 
as a bobbed-hair, wide-eyed child 
prancing on the Jersey sands to 
“Dancing in the Dark” with my 
mom and grandma. I saw myself 
as a soon-to-be high school senior 
screaming “Born to Run” on car 
rides with the friends she might 
not see again. I saw myself as 
a bride with a faceless groom, 
the sweet lyrics of “Jersey Girl” 
serenading our first dance. I saw 
myself as a mother, carefully 
indoctrinating my own daughter 
with Bruce’s music to continue 
the cycle. All of this came rushing 
to me at once, an entire lifetime 
composed of lyrics and guitar 
riffs and saxophone solos. I could 
end this symphony with my own 
finale, but instead I’ll leave it to 
The Boss.
“What else can we do now? 
Except roll down the window and 
let the wind blow back your hair.”
