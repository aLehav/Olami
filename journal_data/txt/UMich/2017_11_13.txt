Each week, The Michigan 

Daily will be publishing a 
wrap-up of the most important 
bills proposed in Michigan 
Legislature over the past seven 
days:

SB 
584-586: 
Last 
week, 

the state Senate Government 
Operations 
Committee 

approved 
three 
bills 
that 

will allow for the carrying of 
concealed weapons in gun-
free areas, including schools, 
churches, bars and dorms. The 
bill was passed along party 
lines in the committee, with 
all Republicans voting in favor 
of the bill and all Democrats 
against.

State Sen. Arlan Meekhof, 

R-West Olive, put forth SB 
584, 
saying 
that 
following 

the shooting in Sutherland 
Springs, 
Texas, 
believing 

action must be taken to prevent 
similar events. 

“Some 
have 
said 
it’s 

insensitive to bring up these 
issues now, but I feel quite 
the opposite,” Meekhof told 
the

Aiming to shed light on 

food and culture, Central 
Student Government hosted 
illUMiNATIONS: 
A 
World 

Showcase 
Friday, 
which 

consisted of a fair and a 
performance 
showcasing 

multiple cultural performance 
groups. 
illUMiNATIONS, 

a part of the Bicentennial 
celebration, 
welcomed 

all students and provided 
admission and food at no cost 
to welcome all. 

The 
event 
focused 
on 

student 
performances 
in 

the 
Mendelssohn 
Theater. 

CSG organized for various 
groups to perform, including 
Ballroom 
Dance, 
who 

performed a Latin routine, 
Revolution, who did a Chinese 
Yoyo performance, Alpha Phi 
Alpha, who performed a step 
routine, Leim, who did an 
Irish Dance and more. 

LSA 
senior 
Julianna 

Davidek said her International 
Studies background drew her 
to this event and discussed 
her 
interest 
with 
the 

diverse range of groups and 
performances.

“Food is one part of culture, 

but performance is another 
part, bringing them together 
as a bigger picture on culture 
as a subject.” Davidek said.

CSG chose to host the event 

to cultivate unity, diversity 
and inclusion by showcasing 
the 
nations 
and 
cultures 

represented by the students 
at the University of Michigan.

Sexual assault allegations surface 
with Zeta Psi over alleged blacklist

Claims reported in the wake of recent suspension of all IFC social activities

When attempting to attend a 

Halloween party at the Zeta Psi 
fraternity house earlier this year, 
LSA sophomore Isis Burgdorf and 
another LSA sophomore, who has 
requested to remain anonymous, 

were reportedly stopped at the door. 
According to Burgdorf, the Zeta 
Psi brothers manning the entrance 
had to check with another brother 
inside to see if the two would be 
allowed to enter. Though both 
students were eventually allowed 
in, Burgdorf’s friend said they were 
held at the door because Burgdorf 
was blacklisted for intervening in 

a potential sexual assault at the 
fraternity just days before.

On Oct. 27, four days before the 

situation at the door of Zeta Psi, 
Burgdorf and her friend attended 
a party at Phi Sigma Kappa. 
According to Burgdorf, her friend 
had too much to drink before going 
out and arrived at Phi Sig already 
intoxicated.

University alum Jonathan Pal, 

a Phi Sigma Kappa brother, was 
also with Burgdorf and the LSA 
sophomore that night. Pal said the 
friend was not served any drinks 
by Phi Sig upon arrival. Later that 
night, Pal and Burgdorf decided to 
send the intoxicated friend home in 
an Uber.

Taking on a theme similar 

to that of TED talks was this 
weekend’s third annual VETx 
event, a program where several 
Ross veterans spoke about 
their experiences after having 
served in either the U.S. or 
other nations’ armed forces. 
Over a hundred veterans and 
family members gathered in 
the Ross Colloquium for the 
event, which was hosted by the 
Armed Forces Association at 
Ross.

As a part of the 2017 

Veteran’s Week on campus, 
VETx aimed to offer veterans 
a platform to share their 
experiences with their peers 
and 
give 
the 
University 

community an opportunity to 
learn from their stories. This 
year’s celebration also had the 
unique distinction of honoring 
the largest class of veterans at 
Ross in the University’s history.

Molly 
Hope, 
a 
graduate 

student 
and 
the 
president 

of the AFA at Ross, said the 
organization aims to support 
veterans to succeed in business 
and socially.

Hope considers VETx an 

extension of the social aspect of 
AFA, which began three years 
ago to increase awareness of 
student veterans’ experiences 
within 
the 
larger 
Ross 

community.

“It started from MBAs who 

wanted to share their unique 
stories with their classmates 

and they thought this would 
be the perfect setting,” Hope 
said. “It kind of evolved around 
wondering how we as veterans 
share 
our 
stories 
because 

we have a lot of lessons that 
we want to tell people about 
and that we think would help 
people in their careers.”

Hope also commented on 

how students at the University 
of Michigan may not normally 
hear stories like the ones 
presented at VETx, and noted 

the importance of having a 
program that give veterans a 
chance to share their stories.

“Most students, at least in 

our program, may not find 
these stories that are so intense 
and so full of emotion, and 
experiences that they can’t 
even fathom in some regard-
they might not feel like these 
stories are accessible in any 
other 
forum,” 
Hope 
said. 

“Having a safe space where it’s 
understood that you’re going 

to engage with these stories, 
and it provides a space for the 
speakers to share their stories.”

The event began with an 

introduction 
from 
Business 

School 
Dean 
Scott 
DeRue 

and then launched into talks 
given 
by 
three 
Business 

graduate 
students: 
Andrew 

Davis, Pratyush Singh and 
Philip Matousek. Each speech 
included a personal anecdote 
from each of the veteran’s times

“We also noticed that

CSG 
chief 

programming officer and 
an LSA sophomore, said. 
“We wanted to make sure

felt a sense of community 
and worked together to put

Committee, 

according to the Detroit Free 
Press. “The recent events will 
allow us to look at how we can 
deter those who want to do 
harm. And responsible, well-
trained, licensed concealed-
pistol holders can be one of 
those deterrents.”

The bill has gained the 

support of the National Rifle 
Association and the Michigan 
Coalition for Responsible Gun 
Owners. 
Steve 
Dulan, 
the 

spokesman for the Coalition, 
said gun-free zones should 
be 
called 
“mass 
murderer 

empowerment zones.”

The 
bill 
has 
received 

opposition from many groups, 
including 
the 
Michigan 

Education 
Association, 

the Michigan Open Carry 
organization 
and 
Moms 

Demand Action. Emily Durbin, 
Michigan chapter president of 
Moms Demand Action for Gun 
Sense in America, said this is 

not the right way to address 
gun violence.

“Two days after the latest 

shooting, 
we’re 
here 
not 

having a conversation about 
keeping 
guns 
away 
from 

domestic abusers, increasing 
background checks or banning 
bump stocks,” Durlan told the 
Free Press. “Instead, we’re 
urgently discussing what the 
gun lobby wants and that’s 
a desire to have more guns 
in more places, no questions 
asked.”

SB 654: This bill amends 

the Natural Resources and 
Environmental Protection Act 
to create an Environmental 
Science 
Advisory 
Board. 

State Sen. David Robertson, 
R-Grand Blanc, proposed the 
legislation.

The function of the board 

will be to “advise the governor 
on 
issues 
affecting 
the 

protection of the environment 
or the management of natural 
resources 
of 
this 
state,” 

according to the bill.

The board’s functions will 

depend on requests from the 
governor to provide advice, 

which will not be legally 
binding 
nor 
enforceable 

“against 
any 
individual, 

governmental entity, private 
entity, or other person.”

HB 5232: This bill would 

ban the use of derogatory 
terms for the mascots of 
Michigan schools. State Rep. 
Jewell Jones, D-Inkster, put 
forth the bill after native 
tribes approached Michigan 
Democrats to express how the 
term “redskins” is insensitive.

If 
passed 
the 
bill 
will 

penalize schools that don’t 
comply by forfeiting “funds 
due under this article in an 
amount equal to the amount 
that is necessary for the 
district or school to become 
compliant with this section.”

The criteria of what is 

derogatory will be determined 
by a list put together by the 
State Board after consulting 
with and gaining the approval 
of the Department of Civil 
Rights. Schools that don’t 
already comply must obtain a 
waiver to continue the use of 
the mascot or slogan deemed 
derogatory.

SATU RDAY MORN ING PHYSICS

MAX KUANG/Daily

Oakland University professor David Garfinkle discusses gravitational wave 
memory at Saturday Morning Physics in Weiser Hall Saturday.

From 
home, 
the 
LSA 

sophomore was picked up by a 
brother in Zeta Psi, who she knew 
from class. The brother picked 
her up to go to Zeta Psi, and she 
told Burgdorf she was going to 
that fraternity. According to the 
anonymous 
LSA 
sophomore, 

she was still too intoxicated to 
consent to sexual activity, and was 
taken to the brother’s room where 
he repeatedly tried to take off her 
dress. She also said the brother 
she was with was sober.

“He kept touching me and kept 

putting his hands up my dress and 
trying to take it off and I just kept 
pulling my dress down,” the LSA 
sophomore said. “There was a lot 
of unwanted touching.”

After her friend had not texted 

Burgdorf for a while, Burgdorf 
and Pal took a Lyft to Zeta Psi’s 
fraternity house. The two were 
reportedly let into the fraternity 
house and asked to be brought 
to the brother’s room where her 
friend was. There, Pal said, they 
found the intoxicated friend fully 
clothed and the brother with his 
pants off on top of her.

“We went downstairs where 

(the brother’s room) was and we 
got down there and we open the 
door and (the intoxicated friend) 
is there and she has her clothes on 
but this other guy, he does not,” 
Pal said. “He has his underwear 
on but he does not have the rest of 
his clothes on.”

Burgdorf and Pal reportedly 

took 
their 
friend 
from 
the 

brother’s room and called a Lyft 
for the three of them back to their 
apartment. Lyft email receipts 
obtained by The Daily confirmed 
Pal ordered a Lyft from Phi Sig to 
Zeta Psi, and then from Zeta Psi 
back to the friend’s apartment that 
night.

Lauck 
Walton, 
executive 

director 
of 
the 
Zeta 
Psi 

International 
Headquarters, 

wrote in an email the organization 
is investigating the claims of 
sexual misconduct, but as of right 
now, no official allegations have 
been filed, and initial reviews of 
the situation claim no brothers are 
at fault.

“We are reviewing all aspects 

of the situation, but to be clear 
there are no allegations of sexual 
misconduct,” Walton wrote. “All 
of the information gathered to 
date indicates that everyone in 
the chapter acted appropriately 
throughout the situation. The 
chapter is working closely with 
the University and hopes for a 
speedy favorable resolution.”

After being stopped at the 

door Halloween night, the LSA 
sophomore said she approached 
the fraternity brother in class and 
he confirmed the blacklist.

“I was talking to him and 

he’s like ‘So we’re all good?’ and 
… (I said) ‘Sure, we’re good,’” 
the LSA sophomore said. “I 
said something about how (the 
brothers at the door) weren’t going 
to let us into his party and he’s like 
‘yeah because Isis (Burgdorf) is 
blacklisted … You were allowed in 
but (Burgdorf) wasn’t so they had 
to talk to (the brother) to see if me 
being on the list to be able to come 
in was enough to let Isis in as well’ 
… Isis was blacklisted because 
she got me out of (the brother’s) 
room.” 

Following this conversation, 

Burgdorf posted in the University 
of 
Michigan 
Class 
of 
2020 

Facebook page about the blacklist 
and Zeta Psi.

“What’s up pals don’t go to 

zeta psi I’m ‘blacklisted’ for 
saving a drunk friend from one 
of the predatory frat brothers 
(sic),” Burgdorf wrote. “Non men 
especially please don’t go there.”

Burgdorf said the fraternity 

is too focused on improving the 
image of the organization on 
campus, and blamed her for the 
situation instead of addressing the 
claims.

“It’s 
frustrating 
for 
me 

mainly just because of why I was 
blacklisted because whenever we 
came on Halloween, (the brother 
at the door) was like ‘You were 
the one that freaked out on (the 
brother), right?’ so he was putting 
all the blame on me and not 
analyzing what the situation was,” 
Burgdorf said. “There’s not really 
another way to twist it. They 
don’t want me in there because I 
stopped their friend from raping 
my friend. That’s what happened.”

Zeta Psi’s Risk Management 

Policy outlines the procedures 
all Zeta Psi chapters must follow 
in regards to alcohol and drug 
abuse, hazing, sexual misconduct 
and general health. While a 
blacklist is not mentioned in the 
policy, the fraternity is required 
to follow state and institution laws 
when possessing and consuming 
alcoholic beverages in the house. 
The policy states being intoxicated 
“to the point of incapacitation” 
eliminates a person’s ability to 
consent to sexual activity.

Walton 
wrote 
Zeta 
Psi 

International 
Headquarters 

is glad the University chapter 
utilizes a blacklist in general to 
keep track of who is and who isn’t 
allowed into the fraternity house.

“Zeta 
Psi’s 
International 

Headquarters 
applauds 
the 

chapter for having an established 
process for deciding who may, 
and may not, have access to our 
chapter property in accordance 
with 
our 
Risk 
Management 

policy,” Walton wrote.

University spokeswoman Kim 

Broekhuizen wrote in an email 
correspondence the University 
cannot comment on this specific 
situation but said the University 
encourages students to report 
instances of sexual misconduct to 
the respective authority figures.

“Bystander 
intervention 
is 

a key component of our sexual 
assault prevention education that 
is provided to all U-M students,” 
Broekhuizen wrote. “We always 
encourage individuals to share 
information about potential and 

experienced prohibited conduct 
with the university as well as law 
enforcement.”

The LSA sophomore said while 

a blacklist system is important to 
keep actual violators of the Risk 
Management Policy off fraternity 
property, she does not believe 
Burgdorf should have been on the 
blacklist for what she did.

“I honestly think it’s awful,” 

the LSA sophomore said. “(Isis) is 
trying to help me. She did nothing. 
It’s not like she was too drunk 
or was touching. A blacklist for 
people that are perverts should 
definitely exist, but a blacklist for 
Isis? No, she was just trying to 
help me and I was just really taken 
aback when (the brother) said 
that.”

On 
Thursday, 
the 

Interfraternity Council suspended 
all fraternity social events and all 
current pledge terms in the wake 
of severe allegations including 
hazing that almost killed three 
fraternity 
pledges, 
sexual 

misconduct, drug violations and 
other events. While Burgdorf’s 
blacklist claim and the preceding 
alleged sexual misconduct event 
are not included in the IFC’s list 
of allegations, as confirmed by 
Walton, Walton wrote Zeta Psi is 
dedicated to cooperating with the 
University in hopes of providing a 
welcoming space for brothers and 
friends of the fraternity alike.

“Zeta Psi is committed to 

working with the Michigan IFC 
and University Administration 
to ensure a healthy and safe 
environment at all times for our 
members and guests,” Walton 
wrote.

The 
Risk 
Management 

Policy also includes a “Duty to 
Report” clause that states all 
Zeta Psi brothers must report 
any violations of the policies to 
the chapter president without 
obstruction from any member of 
the fraternity.

love hearing the side of families, 
because 
sometimes 
it 
gets 

overlooked,” DeMartini said. “I 
hope that people see more of the 
family connection, the family 
aspect of what Dance Marathon 
is, rather than just having a 
fundraising total.”

Susan 
Smiddy, 
a 
music 

therapist at C.S. Mott Children’s 
Hospital, kicked off the evening 
talking 
about 
the 
impact 

DMUM’s efforts have had on the 
music therapy program there, 
which is supported in part by the 
organization’s fundraising. She 
said the hospital engages patients 
with singing, songwriting and 
instruments, providing a sense 
of community and creating a 
space where kids can be kids.

“I just feel so honored to 

be here and to have you guys 
here to listen to their stories 
and everything they’re going 
through 
and 
how 
music 
is 

helping them,” she said.

According 
to 
Smiddy, 
the 

music therapy program’s success 
lies in its ability to give pediatric 
patients a sense of agency in 
their lives and a place for them to 
express their emotions through 
music. Some of the program’s 
patients, she said, even went on 
raise money for the hospital to 
buy more instruments for future 
patients because the therapy was 
so effective for them.

Becky 
McVey, 
a 
certified 

therapeutic 
rehabilitation 

specialist, followed with similar 
sentiments, 
noting 
DMUM’s 

contributions to adapted sports 
and 
recreation 
programs 
at 

Michigan Medicine.

Because of Dance Marathon, 

she said, there are now about 10 
adaptive or inclusive activities run 
by Michigan Medicine, including 
martial 
arts, 
tree 
climbing, 

summer camps, kayaking and yoga. 
She led the audience in a brief yoga 
routine she does with her patients 
to demonstrate some of the work 
her program does.

Monica 
Phillipp, 
a 
DMUM 

alum who currently works at 
North Star Reach camp, talked 
about Dance Marathon’s role in 
helping her organization provide 
kids unique experiences through 
adaptive 
facilities 
such 
as 
a 

wheelchair accessible pool and 
tree house, which might otherwise 
be unavailable to children with 
disabilities.

DMUM’s 
fundraising 
helps 

fund these facilities and student 
dancers often make up some of the 
camp’s volunteer staff. For next 
year, she said, North Star Reach 
hopes to build an outpost where 
campers can sleep outdoors for a 
night.

“A lot of these kids have spent 

a lot of time in the hospital, so 
they aren’t really thinking about 
sleeping under the stars without 
their parents,” she said. “But the 

camp gives them that opportunity 
for independence and creates a 
place where everyone around them 
understands what they’re going 
through.”

Finally, three families shared 

their 
personal 
stories, 
giving 

student dancers a glimpse into 
their lives and how DMUM has 
affected them.

Larry Prout Jr. was born with 

his organs outside of his body and 
has had 100 surgeries to date since 
he was born in 2001.

“Larry didn’t walk until he 

was 9 years old, and now he’s out 
dancing with you guys,” said his 
father, Larry Prout Sr.

Wendy 
Muzzareli 
talked 

about how her daughter, Paige 
Muzzareli, would not have made 
the medical progress she has 
without the therapy supported by 
DMUM’s fundraising.

When Paige was born, doctors 

told 
Muzzareli 
her 
daughter 

would never talk, walk or eat on 
her own. Despite this, Muzzareli 
emphasized her daughter has been 
able to lead a rich and fulfilling life 
due to the care she has received.

“She’s here, she’s smiling, she 

knows how to make you feel better 
when you walk into a room,” said 
Muzzareli. “Therapy has basically 
made her able to sit here today, to 
walk in here today. Without that, 
we were told she would never.”

DMUM events like VictorThon 

also allow families to create strong 
connections within their local 
communities by participating in 
these activities.

“Dance Marathon has brought 

us closer to other families, too,” 
said Muzzareli.

Deb Diehr, mother of Tommy 

Diehr, who passed away earlier 
this year, echoed this appreciation 
for the organization.

“Many, many times last year we 

relied on the dance team — their 
encouragement, the smiles they 
brought to the hospital room,” 
she said. “The gift that (Dance 
Marathon) gives to us as families is 
precious.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Amanda 

Wasserman, who is in her second 
year as a part of Dance Marathon, 
said Saturday’s Family Circles 
night helped her understand the 
importance of the work she does 
for DMUM throughout the year.

“It 
was 
an 
eye-opening 

experience. We could see where 
our 
fundraising 
is 
directly 

going towards, which is really 
rewarding,” 
she 
said. 
“The 

programs that Mott, Beaumont 
and the North Star Reach camp 
are able to provide to these kids 
are really incredible.”

Lillie Heyman, who is also an 

LSA sophomore, agreed.

“It’s really beneficial because 

you see how happy we make 
them. They come to so many 
events because they want to see 
us and we want to see them,” she 
said. “Doing more things like 
this will help get more people 
involved 
and 
make 
(Dance 

Marathon) 
an 
even 
bigger 

organization.”

in service that both brought 
forth questions of ethics and 
values and that could relate 
to possible situations in the 
business world. Afterwards, the 
audience had an opportunity to 
ask questions to the panel of 
student veterans.

During 
his 
panel 

introduction, 
DeRue 
spoke 

about 
the 
University’s 

dedication to helping student 
veterans adjust and succeed on 
campus.

“One of the things that we 

are incredibly proud of is our 
commitment to veterans in 
our community,” DeRue said. 
“When we set our goals for the 
year in terms of admissions 
and building a stellar class, 
one point of emphasis was our 
veteran community. The fact 
that we were able to bump 
up that percent — roughly 40 
percent — to achieve that seven 
percent mark is something we 
are extremely proud of in our 
MBA class.”

DeRue also discussed the 

contribution 
the 
veteran 

community 
makes 
to 
the 

University.

“Having the perspective of 

our veterans who have served 
in all sorts of different roles 
contribute to the conversation 
in 
class 
around 
what 

leadership means, how to lead 
in ambiguous and high risk 
environments, and so forth, 
bring that to life much better 
than I could,” DeRue said.

Later, Davis outlined the 

dilemma 
middle-ranking 

individuals face during a time 
of crisis in regards to whether 
or 
not 
they 
should 
take 

initiative. 

Davis told a story about the 

different ways that he and 
his friend Mike responded 
to an explosion on August 
28, 2013 during their time in 
Afghanistan. Davis explained 
that while he remained with 
a higher ranking officer and 
waited for orders, Mike took 
off towards the chaos, and 
lost his life while saving one 
of his comrades. He tied this 
experiences back to the policies 
at 
various 
companies, 
and 

explained that there are times 
when it is necessary to wait 
for instructions, but also times 
when one must take action.

“Are we ready to recognize 

the moment of truth, when 
action could change everything 
for the course of the better, but 
it may cost us dearly, and when 
nobody is going to blame you for 
inaction because you weren’t in 
charge?” Davis posited. “As I 
go forward in my professional 
career I’m always going to have 
Mike’s example in the back of 
my mind, helping me figure out 
the right thing to do.”

Matousek 
presented 
on 

ethical 
leadership 
and 
the 

importance of remaining moral 
even in situations where acting 
immorally seems easier. 

During his time in Baghdad, 

Matousek and his team faced 
attacks 
from 
a 
seemingly 

faceless enemy. This enemy was 
pervasive and not only sought 
to harm the U.S army, but also 
innocent Iraqi civilians and 
law enforcement. One night, 
Matousek said he and his men 
caught a man they believed 

to be a potential insurgent, 
and while some wanted to 
administer justice themselves, 
Matousek made sure the man 
was brought to the Iraqi law 
enforcement. He explained one 
immoral decision causes others 
to lose respect and that one 
way people can avoid unethical 
decisions is by talking through 
various dilemmas as a group.

“As you develop your own 

teams and you work to become 
a better leader, present your 
team and yourself with ethical 
dilemmas. Talk through what 
the right thing is to do, talk 
through what was actually 
done ... I promise you if you 
prepare yourselves and you 
prepare your team, when you’re 
faced with a dilemma you will 
do what is right.”

David 
Bald, 
Business 

graduate student and the head 
coordinator for VETx, brought 
up the value in having a setting 
for veterans and students to 
come together and listen to the 
experiences of their peers.

“I think this event is really 

special because it gives our 
veterans in the MBA program 
the opportunity to share stories 
that their classmates would not 
normally come across,” Bald 
said. “This event provides an 
open space where they can 
interact with those stories on a 
human to human level.”

Business graduate student 

Sarah Schmidt, a classmate 
of many of the speakers at the 
VETx event, explained she 
attended both to learn from 
the speeches and to show 
her support for her fellow 
classmates.

“I have a lot of classmates 

who are veterans, and I went to 

this event last year, and I really 
enjoyed hearing their stories,” 
Schmidt said. “I think often it’s 
pretty unknown what people 
learn in the military and what 
value they can bring as peers 
and as future colleges. This 
chance to listen to their stories, 
give that attention and bring a 
greater understanding is really 
important.”

Both 
Hope 
and 
Bald 

emphasized how they wanted 
to continue creating spaces for 
veterans to communicate with 
their peers in a less formal 
setting.

Moving forward, the AFA 

at Ross will be hosting smaller 
group conversations in more 
casual areas to allow for 
exactly that. 

“A lot of the stories we 

have don’t fit neatly into a 
presentation, and it seemed 
necessary that we continue this 
conversation, instead of just 
once a year. There are so many 
stories and experiences that 
our veterans want to talk about, 
and maybe they’re still trying 
to make sense of these stories 
themselves,” Bald said. “We’re 
hoping we can engage further 
with others in Ross and in the 
larger Michigan community.”

Bald also explained that the 

overall goal through all these 
events is to ensure that student 
veterans feel comfortable on 
campus, and are able to truly 
feel a part of the Michigan 
community.

“We want to break down 

the barrier of student veteran 
and that sense of other that 
may be present, so that people 
see these stories as accessible 
and by proxy the veterans 
themselves as more accessible.”

create 
an 
event 
that 

would be both unifying and 
entertaining.

CSG 
also 
invited 
many 

multicultural 
student 

organizations to share their 
food and cultures in a buffet 
tent. 
Organizations 
served 

the food of their culture so 
that students could be expose 
their nation and its culture; 
for example, the German Club 
served sauerkraut, spaetzle 
and red cabbage, the Indian 
American Student Association 
served 
samosas 
and 
tikka 

masala and the Malaysian 
Student 
Association 
served 

mixed vegetable and bean 
curd.

LSA sophomore Jeanie Tan 

discussed how important this 
event was for the Malaysian 
Student Association to both 
share 
their 
culture 
and 

promote 
their 
Malaysian 

Cultural Night next semester.

“(Food) 
also 
shows 
the 

unity in Malaysian culture 
amongst the Malays, Indians 
and Chinese,” Tan said. “We 
hope that everyone here who 
gets to try our food, gets to 
meet with us and comes to our 
events.”

The resolution acknowledges 

the discrepancy between what 
the University prescribes for final 
exam scheduling and reality. 
The LSA Faculty Code exam 
protocol states “an instructor 
may not depart from the official 
schedule unless prior approval 
of the University Committee 
on Examinations is obtained.” 
However, 
many 
University 

students can attest to the fact 
that professors do, in fact, 
depart from their scheduled 
exam slot. They either hold 
exams during the last week of 
class, opting for a final paper 
or project, or hold a third, non-
cumulative exam in place of a 
cumulative final during their 
given two-hour finals slot.

The 
perceived 
problem, 

according to the resolution, 
is that exams before the 
scheduled 
exam 
week 

interfere 
with 
regular 

semester work. However, in 
large part, professors tend to 
ease up on coursework in the 
weeks or week before finals. 
As a result, having exams 
at the end of the semester 
instead of during the given 
exam time doesn’t interfere as 
much as one might imagine.

Every 
year, 
students 

anxiously hold their breath 
and check the dates of their 
last exams. Inevitably, there is 
always an exam which lingers at 
the end of the exam period. This 
year, the last day of exams is Dec. 
21. This presents a challenge for 
students who hope to go home 
earlier for winter break.

Graduate students are not 

exempt from this dilemma; 
GSIs must finish grading their 
exams before going home for 
the holidays. For those GSIs 
whose exams are held on Dec. 
21, the possibility exists that 
they would be unable to leave 
until Dec. 24, if at all.

There is also the added 

burden 
of 
finding 
flights 

during the holiday season; 
dorms close at 7:00 p.m. on 
the last day of exams and 
the cost of a flight home for 
such a short period of time 
is not necessarily a financial 
reality. Additionally, for some 
students — out-of-state and 
international 
students, 
for 

example — it may almost not 
be worth it to go home for such 
a short period of time. For 
these reasons, among others, 
many students and instructors 
welcome the option to have 
exams 
earlier 
(before 
the 

scheduled final exam slot).

Moreover, 
we 
challenge 

the efficacy of this resolution 
because it lacks a concrete 
mechanism for enforcement. 
There are countless loopholes 
that 
can 
prevent 
this 

resolution 
from 
effecting 

real 
change: 
Students 
can 

take classes outside of their 
academic program in LSA or 
professors can simply label 
their last exam “Exam three,” 
and continue to place it on the 
last day of class.

Students’ preferences for 

exam scheduling (spread out, 
all at once, early, late, etc.) are 
diverse, and finding a one-
size-fits-all policy would be 

an improbable task. LSA offers 
thousands of courses each 
semester and it is unlikely that 
there is a policy that can be 
evenly enforced. Furthermore, 
a good number of professors 
are bound to ignore the exam 
guidelines (as they already do). 
Though the LSA exam protocol 
does give specific dates for 
classes’ final exams, it still 
allows professors to schedule 
their final exams earlier. Even 
though the resolution attempts 
to fix this, we argue that there 
will still be loopholes and it is 
not the best way to approach 
final exams.

The Michigan Daily Editorial 

Board calls on the school 
of LSA to retain its current 
policy that gives professors 
the 
flexibility 
to 
schedule 

their final assignments before 
their designated final exam 
slot. The resolution passed 
by LSA Student Government 
overestimates 
the 
negative 

impacts 
of 
exams 
during 

regular class time, does not 
take into account the effects 
of late exams on students and 
instructors 
and 
ultimately 

lacks a means for implementing 
change 
on 
a 
broad 
scale. 

For many of us, thoughts of 
returning home have begun to 
swirl in our minds. And as we 
inch closer to Dec. 21, we urge 
LSA to consider scheduling 
exams earlier in the month. 
That way, students and staff 
can enjoy a relaxing winter 
break 
and 
can 
return 
in 

January feeling refreshed and 
ready for the semester ahead. 

T

en minutes. Twenty 
minutes. 
Thirty 

minutes. I don’t think 

I’ve ever stared at a blank 
Word document for so long. 
Is this why so many writers 
go crazy? I could be doing 
something productive right 
now 
— 
like 
sleeping. 
No 

matter what I do, I just can’t 
seem to think of anything to 
write about. Every little thing 
is distracting. Swiveling in 
this chair sure is fun. Oh, look, 
a bird. How fast can I say “toy 
boat?” Before I know it, an 
hour has passed. 

Welcome to the life of an 

English major. I agonize about 
writing on a weekly basis. Over 
time, it doesn’t become hard 
to relate with Jack Nicholson 
from “The Shining,” beating 
away the same sentence on a 
typewriter. But that doesn’t 
change the fact that I love my 
major. Writing is a passion of 
mine, and I enjoy every second 
of self-induced insanity. So 
when people ask me my major, 
why am I reluctant to tell 
them that it’s English?

I think it has something 

to do with also being pre-
med. Before I continue, let me 
clarify that “pre-med” is not a 
major. It simply means that I’m 
taking a set of classes — organic 
chemistry, 
biochemistry, 

physics, etc. — necessary to 
succeed on the MCAT and in 
medical school. That’s why 
when I tell my fellow pre-med 
students that I’m majoring in 
English, I’m usually met with 
blank stares and confusion. 
I feel a bit like Billy Elliot 
admitting his love for ballet in 
an unwelcoming environment.

Once 
they 
process 
my 

seriousness, 
they 
usually 

say 
something 
blunt 
like, 

“Why?” Whether it’s asked 
in disgust or awe depends on 

the person. But no matter the 
tone, I always give the same 
response: “Because I like it.” 
It’s as simple as that.

I think that a lot of students 

in college — especially pre-
meds — major in subjects by 
default 
without 
exploring 

other interests. For example, I 
would guess that a lot of people 
majoring 
in 
biomolecular 

science 
aren’t 
doing 
it 

because they have a yearning 
passion for biomolecules. The 
more likely reason is that 
the required classes for the 
major line up conveniently 
with the prerequisites for 
medical 
school. 
But 
who 

am I to judge? I was once a 
neuroscience 
major 
before 

I 
realized 
that 
learning 

unnecessarily 
detailed 

information about synapses 
wasn’t how I wanted to spend 
my college career. Following 
the 15 advising appointments 
and two existential crises that 
resulted from this realization, 
I learned that a major wouldn’t 
define my future.

Especially 
for 
those 

planning to attend graduate 
school, 
majors 
aren’t 
as 

important as they seem. While 
some may provide slightly 
better 
preparation 
— 
for 

example, a political science 
major may be more suited 
for the LSAT than a physics 
major — it’s ultimately GPA, 
test scores, extracurricular 
activities 
and 
others 
that 

matter. In other words, a 
physics major can get into 
Harvard Law School as long 
as they perform well in each 
of the previously mentioned 
areas and demonstrate that 
they’re a qualified applicant.

Even if a student doesn’t 

have plans to attend graduate 
school, their major doesn’t 
necessarily have to align with 

their intended career path. 
According to one study, only 
about 27 percent of college 
graduates are working in a job 
that relates to their major. As 
reported in Forbes — maybe 
this will humble the Ross kids 
— those who majored in history 
go on to earn just as much in 
the business field as those who 
majored in it. Hear that, Ross 
rejects? There’s still hope! 
The same goes for law and 
medicine. Those who major 
in topics that aren’t typical of 
these fields still achieve the 
same success in their futures.

College 
is 
a 
time 
for 

exploration 
and 
pursuing 

one’s 
interests. 
Therefore, 

I encourage other students 
to find passions outside of 
their intended career track. 
Students 
should 
major 
in 

topics that they genuinely 
want to pursue instead of 
topics they feel pressured to 
pursue. After all, it probably 
won’t have much effect on 
the future, and will result in a 
much happier time at college.

I switched my major three 

times before I decided to 
major in a subject I enjoyed 
rather than in a subject that 
followed the pre-med status 
quo. Yes, because classes such 
as organic chemistry don’t 
count 
toward 
the 
English 

major, I have to take an extra 
eight to 10 English classes on 
top of the prerequisites for 
medical school. But to me the 
workload is worth it. I have 
another 15 years of schooling 
to 
learn 
about 
synapses. 

For now, I want to stick to 
Fitzgerald, Hemingway and 
Faulkner; when people ask me 
my major, I want to proudly 
tell them that it’s English.

T

hat’s 
gay!” 
was 

probably 
the 
most 

common 
phrase 

heard in the halls of my 
elementary or middle school. 
After hearing it so often, I 
remember a point where I, too, 
would utter it whenever extra 
homework was assigned, the 
teacher cancelled our recess 
or one of the boys was acting 
“sensitive” or “emotional.” 
It was what all the cool kids 
did, and I — the nerdy girl 
with 
wire-framed 
glasses 

who wore pigtails until 6th 
grade — desperately needed 
to be cool.

The funniest part about 

it was, for the longest time 
I didn’t know what “gay” 
meant. In the context that 
my peers and I used it in, 
I understood that it meant 
something bad or negative. I 
knew it was something that 
you didn’t want to be, or 
that you weren’t supposed 
to be. It made you different, 
and not different like having 
your ears pierced or hair 
dyed. Different like having 
a disease or a sickness that 
could not be cured. However, 
I had absolutely no clue what 
“gay” meant outside of what 
my knucklehead elementary 
school friends told me it was.

In 
high 
school, 
my 

perception of things changed. 
It had become taboo and 
insensitive 
to 
say 
things 

like “that’s gay.” The stigma 
around 
homosexuality 

decreased as LGBT issues 
became more popular and 
visible in mainstream media. 
Popular TV shows like Glee, 
American 
Horror 
Story, 

Orange is the New Black and 
The Fosters began depicting 
same-sex 
relationships 
or 

“out” homosexual characters 
more explicitly. Around my 
sophomore year, Macklemore 
and Ryan Lewis released their 
heavy-hitting single “Same 
Love,” which advocated for 
the legalization of same-sex 
marriage.

like 
“gender 

inclusive,” “trans,” “queer,” 
“pangender,” 
“genderfluid” 

and “intersex” all came into 
the mainstream at once. I 
became 
overwhelmed 
by 

these new definitions, terms 
and 
identities, 
something 

that just a few years prior had 
been totally under the radar in 
heterosexual communities. I 
had no clue what these things 
meant, and honestly had no 
intention of learning what 
they meant because it did 
not impact my heterosexual 
lifestyle. I reverted back to the 
ignorance of my elementary 
school 
ways, 
throwing 

any part of the non-hetero 
identity under the umbrella of 
“gay.” Meaning that anything 
that was different, or outside 
of heteronormativity in my 
eyes was just … gay. “It’s just 
too much!” I would often say 
in defense of the lack of my 
awareness.

In college, I knew that I 

would have to make a change. 
I was forced into seminars 
and guest speaker lectures 
that explained these terms at 
length, and pried my narrow 
mind open to the perspectives 
and experiences of others 
outside of the heterosexual 
community. 
It 
was 
then 

that I accepted the fact that 
just because I wasn’t part 
of the LGBTQ community 
didn’t mean I had to ignore 
it, remain ignorant or stay 
stubborn.

Things 
are 
constantly 

changing, and it was time for 
me to keep up. My mother is 
the most important person in 
my life, and she raised me on 
the notion that everybody has 
their own bag. Even if their 

bag doesn’t match what’s in 
yours, you still respect it; if 
you don’t understand the slang 
metaphor 
here, 
essentially 

it means that everyone is 
different. No one person is 
going to be exactly alike, yet 
despite this we should respect 
one another and honor each 
other’s differences. I was 
embarrassed 
that 
I 
had 

strayed from this.

I am now embarrassed for 

others who have seemingly 
not 
been 
instilled 
with 

my 
mother’s 
wisdom. 
As 

of a week ago, a few more 
members 
of 
the 
LGBTQ 

community were elected as 
government officials across 
the 
nation. 
But 
here 
on 

campus, students are still 
attacked for disclosing such 
identities to their peers.

Last week a business junior 

revealed he was harassed 
by his roommates after he 
announced his sexuality on 
social media for “National 
Coming Out Day.” This story 
has now been picked up by 
other local media outlets and 
has become somewhat of a hot 
topic on campus, in the wake 
of statistics reporting that 1 in 
6 students feel discriminated 
against on campus. It is 
important to remember that 
discrimination on campus is 
not only racial. Still, even I 
have occasionally succumbed 
to this sort of thinking as 
well. Discrimination, as I 
have learned all too well 
after being on this campus for 
several years, can come in all 
sorts of shades.

Now, you may think — who 

am I to comment on any of 
this, 
especially 
following 

the confession of my prior 
problematic 
outlooks 

regarding 
these 
topics? 

However, I think it is the 
story of my personal growth, 
learning 
experience 
and 

enlightenment that serves as 
a perfect connection to my 
argument. We each have the 
ability to educate ourselves 
and in turn promote more 
progressive, respectful and 
productive ways of thinking 
about ourselves and others. 
So why not do it?

FROM THE DAILY

Keep final exams policy as is
I

t’s that time of year again: Football season is coming to a close, the 
temperature is falling faster than the leaves and the sun is setting 
before most of us eat dinner. Final exam season is on the horizon. 

On Oct. 28, 2017, LSA Student Government passed a resolution that aims 
to decrease the stress imposed on students during the last few weeks of 
the semester. One key provision of the resolution implores the College 
of Literature, Science and the Arts to hold professors accountable for 
administering exams during the time slot assigned by the Registrar’s 
Office. The Michigan Daily calls on the school of LSA to maintain its 
current policy, which gives professors the ability to have all final 
assignments and exams due before the scheduled exam times even begin.

Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams star in “Wonderstruck”
‘Wonderstruck’ ultimately 
is redeemed by innovation
Haynes’s latest release struggles to escape its formulaic plot

This 
review 
was 
first 

published during our coverage 
of 
the 
2017 
Cannes 
Film 

Festival. We are re-printing a 
slightly edited version in honor 
of the film’s release this past 
weekend.

Todd Haynes’s new film 

“Wonderstruck” is a playful if 
somewhat contrived view on 
children, the deaf experience 
and the magic of history 
museums. While stuffed with 
acclaimed 
American 
actors 

including 
Julianne 
Moore 

and 
Michelle 
Williams, 

“Wonderstruck” fails to inspire 
but sufficiently entertains.

“Wonderstruck” 
oscillates 

between 
stories 
that 
are 

parallel in theme but separated 
by 
time. 
The 
film’s 
main 

story takes place in 1979 and 
follows Ben (Oakes Fegley, 
“Pete’s Dragon”), a young boy 
plagued by the recent death of 
his mother and his continuous 
nightmares of wolves, who 
longs to find the identity of 
his father and understand his 
past. Ben loses his hearing 
permanently shortly into the 
film after being struck by 
lightning. The other story, set in 
1929, follows Rose (first-timer 
Millicent Simmonds), a young 
deaf girl trapped in a loveless 
household and obsessed with 
the silent movies of the era. 
The stories follow a parallel 
trajectory: Both protagonists 
escape their unhappy homes 
and embark on a journey to 
New York City, where they 
search for and find compassion 
and companionship.

Furthermore, both stories 

highlight the deaf experience 
and 
challenge 
the 
notion 

of 
communication; 
as 

neither 
character 
speaks 

sign 
language, 
they 
must 

communicate through pen and 
paper, creating a lagging time 
between question and answer 
and subsequently generating 
suspense 
and 
frustration. 

The film does a great job of 
spotlighting an often-forgotten 
disability by celebrating and 
destigmatizing 
deafness, 

reversely 
constructing 
a 

whimsical story of two lost 
souls who happen to be deaf.

Beyond its characterizations, 

the film explores deafness 
through form. Todd Haynes 
brilliantly tells the cinematic 
tale of two deaf kids through 
the form of a silent movie, 
playing with the conventions 
of the genre to create multiple 
layers 
through 
which 
to 

explore the deaf experience. 
Rose’s story is told through 
the satirized silent film, with 
exaggerated gestures, sounds 
effects and musical cues to 
mimic the format of the classic 
silent picture. Furthermore, 
the shots in Rose’s storyline 
are 
in 
black-and-white, 

contributing to the overall Old 
Hollywood feel. Ben’s story 
is similarly crafted with the 
tropes of a silent film, but with 
a modern twist; his scenes are 
characterized by jazz and rock 
music instead of sound effects, 
with a heightened emphasis on 
cinematography and lighting 
to create a more stylized feel. 

Ultimately, 
the 
silent 
film 

format creates multiple layers 
through 
which 
to 
portray 

the deaf experience, while 
simultaneously paying respect 
to an era of cinema equally 
accessible to the hearing and 
the hearing-impaired.

Museums 
also 
play 

an 
important 
role 
in 

“Wonderstruck”, 
both 
as 

settings 
and 
plot-drivers. 

Museums act as the stage 
on which characters meet, 
cultivate friendships, discover 
passions and work through 
issues. While the parallel story 
segments seem disjointed and 
unrelated for a large portion 
of the film, the end reveals 
that 
the 
two 
protagonists 

are united by the Natural 
History Museum, both the 
place where Rose’s and Ben’s 
fathers worked, and where Ben 
discovered his father’s identity. 
The 
film’s 
preoccupation 

with museums extends to its 
form as well; the origin story 
of Ben’s father, a diorama 
maker for the museum, is told 
through a complex diorama 
format reminiscent of Laika 
Entertainment 
claymation. 

Again, Haynes exhibits his 
ability to play with form and 
construct multiple, self-aware 
layers of storytelling.

As a whole, “Wonderstruck” 

is a charming but formulaic 
story, 
with 
uninspired 

acting 
and 
cheesy 
clichés. 

The plot escalates suddenly 
and without warning, with 
betrayal 
or 
revelations 

happening too quickly and 
conveniently to feel genuine. 
However, Haynes’s innovative 
use of form saves this film 
from mediocrity, effectively 
revealing unexplored themes 
in a playful and subtle way.

SINGLE REVIEW

In case you missed it, Dis-
ney-bred pop duo Aly & AJ 
is making music again after 
a decade-long hiatus. Now 
operating under their own 
record label, the sisters are 
putting out incredible West 

Coast-inspired synthpop. 
We got the first taste with 
mid-August release “Take 
Me” and another dose this 
past week with shiny single 

“I Know.”

Both songs present some 
of the most intricate pop 

production heard in recent 

years. “Take Me” lacks 
predictability even after 

multiple listens, leading into 
each refrain differently and 
scattering the multiple lay-
ers of backtracks to create 
a song that sounds coherent 
against all odds. “I Know” is 
similar in that it plays with 
syncopation, but relies heav-
ily on vocal distortion to cre-

ate ear-catching production. 
One of the finest examples 

occurs post-bridge with 
a crescendoing autotune-
enhanced delivery of the 

title lyrics, “I know / you 

know who’s going to pick you 
up / who’s going to take you 
home” that culminates in an 
ornate drum sequence and 
leads into the final refrain.
From many angles, “I Know” 

is a pick-me-up song. The 
lyrics resemble the average 

pep talk given to a friend 

going through a rough patch, 

reassuring them with, “it’s 
going to be fine” and plead-
ing, “tell me what will get 
you out.” Besides the raw 
lyric content, the delivery 
and its surrounding atmo-
sphere add to the comfort-
ing spirit of the track. The 
vocals transition from des-
perate and sympathetic to 
motivating; the glittery and 
airy synth production ulti-
mately induces a soothing 

quality.

With the release of “I 
Know,” Aly & AJ also 

announced that their new 
EP, aptly-named Ten Years, 

will be out Nov. 17. The 

released singles place a huge 
amount of potential into the 
forthcoming work, proving 
that these sisters are back 

and better than ever.

DAILY LITERATURE COLUMN

June Jordan, a poet for 

the people

Poetry 
has 
long 
held 

the reins as a conduit for 
conscious 
revolution. 
In 

recent years particularly this 
notion has blossomed, as poets 
like Claudia Rankine have 
gained traction due in part to 
their work with social protest 
poems. Their poems are not 
only intelligently crafted, but 
are also deeply heartfelt and 
socially conscientious.

There are probably few who 

embody this balance more 
thoroughly than June Jordan. 
Alive for two-thirds of the 
twentieth century, Jordan’s 

work 
not 
only 
influenced 

the 
always-evolving 
craft 

of literature; it also came to 
represent many of the issues at 
the forefront of her own time. 
She wrote about race, class, 
sexuality, LGBTQ experiences 
and a great deal more, often 
anchoring her work in specific 
historical events and figures. 
Her nickname was literally 
“the Poet of the People,” and it 
isn’t very hard to see why.

The only child of Jamaican 

immigrant 
parents, 
Jordan 

was raised in Harlem during 
the 1940s. She developed very 
distinctive ideas about race 
and identity from a young 

age, due in part to her father 
— who also shared with her 
his love of literature — and 
in part to her experiences 
attending 
a 
predominantly 

white high school. She later 
attended 
Barnard 
College, 

but dropped out following 
her extreme dissatisfaction 
with the curriculum, which 
focused almost exclusively on 
white men.

One 
of 
Jordan’s 
most 

remarkable 
facets 
is 
her 

versatility. She engaged in a 
number of different writing 
styles, including playwriting, 
children’s 
literature 
and 

journalism as a columnist for 
The Progressive. Even within 
her poetry alone, one can 
detect an amazing tendency 
to explore and to experiment. 
Her range of skills extends 
from beautiful descriptions 
(“It’s Hard to Keep a Clean 
Shirt Clean”) to modernesque 
freeform 
(“In 
Memoriam: 

Martin Luther King, Jr.”) to 
almost prose-like storytelling 
(“A Poem about Intelligence 
for My Brothers and Sisters”).

The emotions in her poems 

are 
deeply 
rendered, 
and 

accessible even to strangers 
reading her work from half 
a century away. She often 
draws from the well of her 
own 
personal 
experience 

with familiar issues, even 
when she’s attaching those 
experiences 
to 
well-known 

instances and figures, such as 
in “1977: Poem for Mrs. Fannie 
Lou Hamer.”

Jordan 
isn’t 
afraid 
to 

venture into the realm of the 
confessional. Her beautiful 
poem 
“Apologies 
to 
All 

the 
People 
in 
Lebanon,” 

probably my favorite of the 
ones 
mentioned 
here, 
is 

a personal apology to the 

people of Lebanon, on behalf 
of herself and all of the 
American people, for their 
lack of aid or interference in 
the South Lebanon conflict. 
Jordan shows no reservation 
here in claiming her own 
culpability in the matter, with 
straightforward 
lines 
such 

as: “Yes, I did know it was 
the money I earned as a poet 
that / paid / for the bombs 
and the planes and the tanks 
/ that they used to massacre 
your family.” This is strikingly 

honest, and speaks volumes as 
to the genuine quality of her 
poetry.

Jordan’s literary impacts 

are 
undeniable, 
from 
her 

approaches to the complex 
topic 
of 
privilege 
to 
her 

contributions 
to 
feminist 

theory. Equally remarkable is 
the fact that while she often 
writes about specific moments 
or aspects of history, her work 
is no less relevant today than 
it would have been thirty or 
fifty years ago. She is not only 
a poet for the people, but for 
America and for the ages.

USA

Another western, but they get it right.
USA’s ‘Damnation’ is off 
to a solid start in premiere

In the ongoing trend of western TV shows, USA gets it right

There’s just something about 

the Wild West that captures 
the 
hearts 
of 
Americans. 

Maybe 
it’s 
the 
dilapidated 

saloon doors, or the glistening 
revolvers, 
or 
the 
folksy 

language, or maybe it’s all 
three. Either way, at the risk 
of overgeneralizing, I’ll say I 
believe that, across the country, 
the Wild West continues to 
maintain a tantalizing aura 
of mystique and possibility. 
Part of this is likely due to the 
genre’s consistently romantic 
depiction in Hollywood. From 
Sergio 
Leone’s 
Spaghetti 

Westerns during the 1960s 
to more recent entries like 
“Bone 
Tomahawk” 
and 

“Westworld,” it’s not hard to 
find the glamorized world of 
rustling tumbleweeds on your 
television or in your local AMC 
theater.

Seizing on the persistent 

popularity of the Wild West, 
USA’s latest foray into this 
genre — “Damnation” — leans 
more 
toward 
the 
“There 

Will 
Be 
Blood” 
spectrum 

of Westerns. Similar to one 
of 
my 
personal 
favorites, 

“Damnation” 
juxtaposes 

Christian 
proselytization 

with the brutality of the Wild 
West. While nowhere near as 
effective or groundbreaking as 
its distant Hollywood relative, 
“Damnation” remains a solid 
addition to the Western genre, 
with 
substantial 
potential 

for growth if it can adopt a 
less heavy-handed approach 
moving forward.

Immediately, the first thing 

I 
noticed 
while 
screening 

“Damnation” was its gorgeous 
sweeping 
landscapes. 
With 

shots of barren rolling hills 
and 
farmland 
stretching 

into the horizon, the series 
provides the type of visual 
highlight reel that audiences 

have come to expect from their 
Westerns. I’ve never visited 
Iowa or Kentucky — the two 
locales featured in the show — 
but I’ve been to Nebraska and 
Tennessee, so I feel marginally 
qualified to hazard a guess 
that “Damnation”’s vistas are 
accurate for these two states 
during the 1930s.

Side note: if you’re from 

Iowa or Kentucky and want to 
dispute my scenic evaluation, 
feel free to pay a visit to my 
editor — he lives on East 
University Ave. and simply 
loves critics dropping by.

Beyond 
its 
excellent 

cinematography, “Damnation” 
succeeds with its talented cast. 

Frankly, I had no idea who the 
hell Killian Scott (“Calvary”) 
was before watching the show, 
but I can now say that I’m 
quite a fan. In the series, Scott 
carves out a distinct identity 
as a manipulative roaming 
preacher 
who 
knows 
how 

to handle a Colt .32 as well 
as he knows Genesis verses. 
Elsewhere, fellow unknown 
Teach Grant (“The Tall Man”) 
effectively makes the most of 
his limited screen time in the 
show’s premiere. The show’s 
veteran presence comes in the 
form of established Wild West 
actor Christopher Heyerdahl 
(“Tin Star”), who turns in a 
quality performance as the 
cliché, devil-may-care cowboy. 
There’s nothing new about 
Heyerdahl’s 
character, 
but 

every Western needs a cunning 
villain, and Heyerdahl does a 
great job of inspiring hatred 
for his persona.

I 
especially 
appreciated 

Heyerdahl’s 
role 
since 
he 

comes to “Damnation” after 
a five-season run on AMC’s 
own wild west series, “Hell 
on Wheels.” As a longtime 
Western fan, I couldn’t help 
but love that the show cast 
Heyerdahl in a prominent role 
in a Western a year after he 
finished his run on a different 
Western. It instantly recalled 
in my mind Leone’s usage 
of 
Clint 
Eastwood 
(“Gran 

Torino”) in three back-to-
back-to-back wild west forays.

As flattering at it is for 

“Damnation” to be compared 
to a Leone Western, the two 
entries diverge in terms of their 
plotlines. While a typical Leone 
Western is comprehensive yet 
concise, “Damnation” is just 
comprehensive to a fault. The 
series suffers from its gradual 
pacing 
that 
extends 
every 

scene a few minutes too long. 
By drawing out every shot, 
the show becomes somewhat 
clumsy, spending five minutes 
on a scene that audiences 
understand in two. It’s not the 
worst quality in the world for 
a series to possess in an age 
of meticulous television, but 
it renders the show tedious to 
seasoned viewers who rely on 
more succinct storylines and 
more exciting writing — both 
of which “Damnation” lack 
— to keep them entertained. 
“Damnation” could use a little 
bit of “Westworld”’s magic in 
this area, so someone dial up 
Jonathan Nolan (“The Dark 
Knight”) for USA.

With 
some 
added 
flair 

and a few trimmed scenes, 
“Damnation” 
could 
truly 

cement itself as the network 
alternative 
to 
“Westworld,” 

which is already dominating 
the 
small-screen 
western 

genre after only one season. 
It’s a long way to go for 
“Damnation” to reach such 
heights, so it better holster its 
pistol and start climbing.

Sam Smith is back with his silly, sappy love songs.
Sam Smith proves king 
of the modern love song

On his sophomore album, Smith’s heartbreak won’t destory you

After a three year absence, 

British vocalist Sam Smith is 
back, and as cliché as it sounds, 
he really is better than ever. 
With his sophomore album, 
The Thrill of it All, Smith 
exploits and emphasizes all of 
the pieces that made his debut 
project, In the Lonely Hour, 
a huge hit, giving listeners a 
record that is Sam Smith to 
the max. Piano-driven beats, 
forty-piece background choirs, 
and the singer’s out-of-this-
world vocal talent are the 
primary components of the 
singer’s formula for love-song 
success, and they all make 
The Thrill of it All a gripping 
album. These proven pieces 
are met with Smith’s new and 
obvious musical growth, and 
when combined with a venture 
into 
the 
artist’s 
relatively 

undiscussed 
homosexuality, 

they convey one major thing: 
Smith is the king of the modern 
pop love song.

The 
album’s 
first 
track, 

“Too Good at Goodbyes,” is a 
pleasant kick in the teeth, an 
enjoyable overload of all things 
Sam Smith. It opens with the 
classic 
Smith-piano 
combo 

that listeners so thoroughly 
enjoyed on In the Lonely Hour. 
This sound is comfortable for 
both Smith and the listener, 
and 
plays 
right 
into 
the 

aforementioned 
love-song 

formula (piano + voice = really 
good Sam Smith love song), 
making it the perfect way 
to open an album with such 
weight and anticipation. At this 
point, the singer is warming 

the listener up for what’s to 
come; instead of throwing 
us head-first into cold and 
unfamiliar water, Smith guides 
us slowly down the steps feet-
first into the shallow end so we 
can properly acclimate to the 
temperature. Eventually, the 
track picks up with a bouncy 
beat and infectious melody — 
it’s new, but it feels and sounds 
like your forgotten favorite 
track from a few years ago. 
When the massive choir hits 
(the “choir” is typically just 
a massive layering of Smith’s 
vocals), it’s all over; the song is 
“Stay With Me” times ten, and 
the listener has no choice but 

to submit to the power of the 
love song.

Many of the songs on the 

album follow this same trend. 
They are built on something 
comfortable 
and 
familiar, 

and many could have easily 
appeared on In the Lonely 
Hour, but Smith introduces 
something 
new 
and 
fresh 

that is just enough to make 
the tracks exciting, rather 
than obsolete. “Say It First” is 
grounded on a gloomy, guitar-
driven beat that is right in 
Smith’s wheelhouse, but the 
chorus introduces electronic 
vocals akin to something Diplo 
might 
endorse. 
“One 
Last 

Song” opens with a sliced and 
pitched-up vocal sample that 
one could hear on a Kanye 
West track, but it quickly falls 

into a classic and infallible 6/8 
shuffle that Smith murders 
with his soulful belting. This 
tactic is safe and pragmatic; 
Smith knows what works, and 
he blends the proven with the 
experimental to remind the 
world of his talent. He’s grown 
as an artist over the past three 
years, and the proof is in the 
pudding.

Smith 
is 
most 
at 
the 

vanguard 
on 
“HIM,” 
a 

song that professes Smith’s 
homesexuality in bold, and 
details his personal struggle. 
The track opens with, “Holy 
Father, we need to talk / I have 
a secret that I can’t keep,” 
addressing his pain head-on; 
raised religious and educated 
in catholic school, it’s not 
surprising that the now openly-
gay vocalist has struggled with 
the implications of his sexual 
orientation. In the chorus, 
Smith sends a message to the 
world, singing “Don’t you try 
to tell me that God doesn’t 
care for us / It is him I love, it 
is him I love.” This song marks 
the first instance in which 
Smith 
explicitly 
discusses 

his sexuality in his music, 
contributing to the already 
established trend of blending 
new with old.

While some might get tired 

of Smith’s tales of unrequited 
love, such is the singer’s brand, 
and at a short and sweet 35 
minutes, The Thrill of it All 
will 
certainly 
not 
dampen 

your thoughts with ideas of 
heartbreak. Take a half-hour 
out of your day to indulge in 
the moving love songs and 
other-worldly voice of the self-
professed diva boy — you won’t 
regret it.

Motivated by anger

COLLEGE PARK — It isn’t 

common that a game features a 
battle between a third-string and 
fourth-string 
quarterback, 
but 

with both Michigan and Maryland 
ravaged by injuries to their men 
under center, that is exactly what 
happened Saturday.

While 
neither 
quarterback 

put their definitive stamp on 
the contest, redshirt freshman 
Brandon Peters had enough help 
from both teams for the Wolverines 
(5-2 Big Ten, 8-2 overall) to come 
away with a 35-10 victory over the 
Terrapins (2-5, 4-6).

“He made the big play, and he 

was very accurate,” said Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh. “... He played 
the kind of football we like, and he 
did a nice job.”

He finished 9-for-18 with 145 

yards and two touchdowns on the 
day, but even those scores through 

the air came off fortunate breaks.

The most work Peters had to 

do was launch a deep throw over 
the top of the defense to redshirt 
sophomore tight end Zach Gentry, 
who was wide open over the middle. 
Gentry took the pass the rest of the 
way into the end zone for a 33-yard 
score with just over 11 minutes 
remaining in the second quarter. By 
that point, the Wolverines already 
had a two-possession lead.

On Michigan’s first scoring 

drive, Gentry came up with an 
impressive catch in the red zone 
when Peters’ pass looked to be 
out of reach, even for his 6-foot-
7 frame. After catching the pass, 
Gentry almost ran it into the end 
zone, but he was knocked out of 
bounds a few yards shy.

That presented an opportunity 

for fifth-year senior Henry Poggi 
to notch a career highlight. In 
a homecoming game for the 
Baltimore native, Poggi punched it 
in from two yards out for his first 
touchdown as a Wolverine. 

On Michigan’s second drive, 

Peters looked to be in trouble 
as the Maryland defense came 
barreling down upon him. But he 
was able to drop it off to Higdon 
before absorbing a hard hit, and 
the running back weaved his way 
through the defense for a 35-yard 
gain.

The Terrapins were called for a 

roughing the passer penalty, adding 
15 more yards onto the play to move 
the Wolverines all the way up to 
Maryland’s 16-yard line. Evans had 
to rush just three times after that 
before leaping into the end zone for 
the score.

Peters’ 33-yard touchdown to 

Gentry was also the byproduct of 
a Terrapin miscue. Down 14-0 at 
the start of the second quarter — 
after all three of its first-quarter 
drives ended in a three-and-out 
— Maryland tried to execute a 
fake punt. But the Terrapins were 
halted and called for a penalty, 
giving Michigan the ball deep in 
Maryland territory.

It took Peters all of one play to 

end that drive with a touchdown 

pass to Gentry.

“Their safety was playing way 

backside,” Peters said. “The seam 
just popped.”

His second score of the day 

came in a similar fashion. On the 
very next possession, sophomore 
defensive 
back 
Josh 
Metellus 

blocked the Terrapins’ punt at the 
19-yard line, giving the ball right 
back to the Wolverines.

Junior running back Karan 

Higdon broke toward the outside 
for a 16-yard rush, and then Peters 
lofted a pass to sophomore tight 
end Sean McKeon for a three-yard 
touchdown.

It took just two plays for that 

drive to reach the end zone.

“I just really sold the fake,” 

Peters said, “and they really bit on 
it.”

Walk-on 
quarterback 
Ryan 

Brand didn’t have the same amount 
of support from either side in his 
first career start for Maryland, 
finishing 16-for-35 with 136 yards 
and a touchdown.

Toward the end of the first 

quarter, Maryland attempted to 
wake up its offense with a double 
reverse 
pass 
between 
Brand 

and Harrison. But with acres of 
daylight in front of him, Brand 
couldn’t come up with the catch in 
the backfield.

And even when Brand had his 

best opportunity of the first half 
near the end of the second quarter 
— after the Terrapins had managed 
to reach Michigan’s 10-yard line — 
sophomore defensive back David 
Long intercepted the ball in the end 
zone and returned it 80 yards.

Brand found some success in 

the second half, though, At the end 
of the third quarter, he completed 
two consecutive deep balls to place 
Maryland at the Wolverines’ five-
yard line. But the drive stalled at 
the goal-line, and the Terrapins had 
to settle for a field goal to finally end 
the shutout bid.

On the next possession, Brand 

finally found the end zone. After a 
methodical drive through the air, 
Brand hit receiver Taivon Jacobs 
for a 10-yard touchdown to bring 

the deficit down to 28-10.

“They were executing well,” 

Harbaugh said. “I mean, the 
execution was good the whole 
game, but then we made a few 
mistakes defensively, made a few 
mistakes offensively.

“... (It) was a combination of 

both, and they made some plays.”

But 
Maryland 
committed 

another key error on the next 
series, and Michigan capitalized 
yet again. On a deep pass from 
Peters 
to 
freshman 
receiver 

Donovan 
Peoples-Jones, 
the 

Terrapin defender was called for 
a pass interference penalty. Evans 
made Maryland pay, rushing 17 
yards into the end zone to seal the 
victory. 

Taking 
advantage 
of 
the 

Terrapins’ 
miscues 
throughout 

the day, the Wolverines had what 
Harbaugh called one of the best 
games of their season.

“I really think it might have been 

our best ballgame — in all three 
phases,” he said. “Very sound game 
by our team.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Despite slow start, 
Michigan wins big

It certainly wasn’t the way 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team had hoped to open its 
regular season.

After a lackluster start left 

the Wolverines down seven 
with 10:18 left in the first 
half, it would be awhile before 
things got 
better. 
While 
Michigan 
eventually powered its way 
to an 87-67 win over North 
Florida, 
it 
wasn’t 
pretty, 

especially at the beginning of 
the contest.

In 
the 
first 
half, 
the 

Wolverines 
shot a meager 
38 percent from 
the field, were 
outrebounded 
20-14 and gave 
up a host of 
good looks on 
defense, as the 
Ospreys 
shot 

45 percent from 
the field and 67 
percent 
from 

three.

Michigan’s 
saving 
grace 

came 
from 
three 
major 

offensive 
contributors. 

Redshirt sophomore forward 
Charles 
Matthews, 
junior 

forward Moritz Wagner and 
fifth-year 
senior 
forward 

Duncan Robinson combined 
for 59 points. With their 
efforts, 
along 
with 
some 

timely contributions from role 
players, Michigan managed to 
secure a 1-0 record.

The deciding stretch came 

after a pair of free throws from 
Ospreys forward Wajid Aminu 
tied the game with 11:03 left to 
play. The Wolverines went on 
an 37-17 run to end the game, 
using opportunistic defense to 

force turnovers that resulted 
in open looks to earn a lead 
they would never relinquish.

“Little things kind of started 

to go our way here and there 
just because I think we had a 
heightened sense of urgency,” 
Robinson said. “The game kind 
of tends to favor the bold in 
that sense. Being more active, 
being the aggressor, you get 
more bounces, get shots to go 
in. That started happening in 
the second half.”

Turnovers were ultimately 

the key to the outcome. North 
Florida committed 24 of them, 
and though its hot shooting 
from deep kept the game close, 
the task of overcoming their 
mistakes proved to be too 

tough for the 
Ospreys.

“I 
thought 

they threw it to 
us a few times, 
but 
we 
were 

just trying to 
just be solid,” 
said Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein. 
“Sometimes, 
if you’re just 

solid, they’ll run out of options 
and they’ll throw it away. And 
that’s really what happened. 
We weren’t trapping, we were 
just playing straight, good, 
hard, pressure defense.”

Michigan won’t have long 

to ponder on the mistakes 
that kept this game close 
for most of its duration, as it 
will return to Crisler Center 
on Monday to face Central 
Michigan.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

were expected to have some 
growing pains at the beginning 
of the season, if they don’t 
tighten up the basics, even 
some of their games against 
lackluster opponents could be 
contested. 

The Wolverines opened the season by 
eventually blowing out North Florida

Two games to change the narrative

A

nger is a powerful 
motivator, so said Jim 
Harbaugh this Saturday.

Well, it’s time to find out just how 

true that is. 

In the week that followed a 

thorough thrashing at the hands 
of then-No. 2 Penn State, the 
Wolverines’ disappointment 
— touched with a dose of that 
underlying anger — was palpable.

Defensive coordinator Don 

Brown said if the Wolverines went 
any harder in practice they would 
start hurting themselves.

Rashan Gary admitted he wasn’t 

sure how to feel. He said it hurt, but 
also said he was happy it happened, 

calling it adversity this team needed 
to go through.

And he called on those who said 

Michigan’s defense still needed to 
prove itself to pay attention for the 
rest of the year.

“I don’t feel personally we have 

to prove anything to anybody,” he 
said then.

The fact is, whether Gary deems 

it a necessary crucible or not, the 
Wolverines still haven’t proved any 
of their doubters wrong. Michigan 
has become a different team since 
its season was about to run off the 
rails in State College, but no one 
truly knows what that means yet.

The Wolverines have themselves 

a new quarterback in Brandon 
Peters, and he has acquitted himself 
well enough — completing 28 of his 

46 attempts for 329 yards and four 
touchdowns through three games.

Karan Higdon, and the stable 

of backs behind him, have thrived 
behind a resurgent offensive line 
— rushing for an average of 288.3 
yards per game.

The defense has done its part too, 

holding three straight opponents to 
14 points or less.

But the fact remains: the results 

against those opponents were 
expected all along. The Wolverines 
beat Rutgers and Minnesota 
handily at home. Saturday 
afternoon, they kept up with those 
expectations, notching a 35-10 
victory against Maryland in College 
Park.

They’ve picked up the pieces 

from the disaster in State College, 

but they haven’t put them entirely 
back together just yet. 

That anger still festers. It should 

for Jim Harbaugh too. And it goes 
beyond the confines of this season.

Yes, Michigan was embarrassed 

against Penn State. That one loss 
matters, but it is only one stroke of 
an ugly painting.

Last season, the Wolverines were 

sitting pretty, hopes of a College 
Football Playoff berth glimmering 
with three weeks remaining in the 
season.

Then they went to Iowa City, and 

lost. They went to Columbus, and 
lost. They went to the Orange Bowl 
and lost again. All in all, a season 
seemingly destined for glory was 
halted in its tracks.

So here Michigan is again, faced 

with two games to close the season 
that will be a barometer of just how 
far this team has come — not just 
since Penn State, but since last year.

Win them, and that’s another 

10-2 record with a whole lot of 
intangible progress attached to it. 
Lose them and, well, that’s a story 
for another day.

First up is a trip to Madison. No. 

5 Wisconsin hasn’t needed anger 
as a motivator, mainly because the 
Badgers don’t have much reason to 
be angry. They remain the Big Ten’s 
only undefeated team, and for the 
most part, it’s been an easy path to 
this point.

No. 8 Ohio State, on the other 

hand, had plenty to be angry about. 
And the Buckeyes can agree with 
Harbaugh on one thing: anger is a 
powerful motivator indeed. They 
avenged a 55-24 upset at Iowa by 
hanging 48 points on Michigan State 
— blowing the Spartans out at home.

The odds are grim for Michigan 

from here. Add in the fact that the 
Wolverines have yet to beat a team 
with a winning record this year, or 
that they haven’t beaten a ranked 
team on the road since 2006, and 
the odds are even grimmer.

But all those losses can’t be 

rectified until Michigan beats a 
quality opponent. And they’re about 
to face two.

Let’s see just how angry the 

Wolverines are.

Shattering expectations

E

verything to prove. 

This is how the 

Michigan hockey team 

entered its season, slated to be 
a bottom-feeder in the highly 
competitive Big Ten by the 
preseason coaches’ poll.

Over the first month of 

their season, the Wolverines 
relentlessly worked to shatter 
that predetermined image.

A sweep of Vermont in the 

home opening series. Chip.

A 5-2 rout 

of then-No. 
15 Penn State 
— at State 
College. Chip.

A fairly 

consistent 
top-10 
ranking for 
its potent 
offense. Chip.

Despite 

these early 
season accolades, uncertainty 
lingered. Michigan undoubtedly 
had talent, making last year’s 
lifeless squad seem like a 
remote memory far in the past. 
But what were the bounds of its 
success?

The conference home opener 

against No. 4 powerhouse 
Minnesota would act as a 
barometer for this question.

And the Wolverines were 

well aware of that beforehand.

“We’re playing a team 

that has balance and depth,” 
said Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson. “I don’t want to speak 
negatively to the teams we’ve 
played but they don’t quite 
have the depth in the scoring 
that Minnesota does.”

This weekend, all eyes 

turned anxiously to Ann Arbor 
to watch the Wolverines take 
on conference royalty.

And the first eight minutes 

of Friday’s second period 
emphasized that dethroning 
the Golden Gophers would not 
be simple. Minnesota’s stacked 
offense blitzed Michigan’s 

defensive zone, burying three 
goals, all while the Wolverines 
still had nothing to show for 
their efforts.

That moment could have 

been the answer to the question 
of how long Michigan’s early 
success could be sustained. 

In the Golden Gophers’ 

previous four games, they 
had been stingy, giving up a 
meager 0.75 goals per game on 
average. Two of those games 
were against No. 11 Clarkson. 
Michigan had just over half a 
game to resurrect its offense 
while simultaneously stopping 
Minnesota. You can do the 
math.

A comeback, given the 

circumstance, was pretty 
implausible. But Michigan 
wasn’t fazed.

By the second intermission, 

the Wolverines rallied to make 
it a one-goal game. By the end 
of regulation, they had tacked 
on two more, sending the game 
to overtime.

On a power play in extra 

time, a shot from sophomore 
forward Will Lockwood 
connected with fifth-year 
senior Alex Roos’ helmet in 
front of the Gopher net. It 
was unorthodox, but the puck 
tipped in. Michigan won. Yost 
Ice Arena erupted.

“I’ve been in hockey a long 

time,” Pearson said. “You see 
a lot of strange things happen, 
so until that final second is off 
the clock, you continue to play. 
And that’s what I like about 
this team. And you’re going 
to continue to see that from 
them.”

In the series’ second 

game, the Wolverines saw a 
shockingly similar storyline. 
They had a four-goal deficit in 
the second. They again played 
what Pearson described as 
“heart-attack hockey,” tying 
the game at six with just over a 
minute left in the final period. 
After a fruitless overtime on 
both sides of the puck, the 
battle ended in a draw.

“Sometimes a tie feels like 

a loss,” Pearson said. “And 
sometimes, a tie actually 
feels like a win. And just the 
situation we were in, and to 
come back and get a tie for 
NCAA purposes is huge.”

And indeed it should feel 

like a win.

This weekend was a test. 

And the Wolverines passed it 
with flying colors.

No, it wasn’t pretty. Friday’s 

5-4 overtime win was not a 
blowout, and Michigan didn’t 
sweep the weekend. Both 
nights, the Wolverines played 
thriller hockey, only emerging 
midway through the game, 
and in the nick of time for a 
dazzling comeback in both 
games.

Yet Michigan, unranked, 

rattled the Gophers, who — up 
until Friday — were yet to give 
up five goals in one sitting. 
The next night they gave up 
six. The Wolverines battled 
adversity and walked away 
with a victory. Minnesota 
alternatively left Yost 
emptyhanded, devoid of a win 
on the weekend for the first 
time this season.

“(Minnesota) is a good 

hockey team,” Pearson said. 
“I thought for the most part 

it brought the best out in our 
team at times.”

There is no more conjecture 

regarding the extent of 
Michigan’s talent this season. 
The Wolverines gave the 
Golden Gophers their most 
troublesome weekend thus far 
this season, affirming that they 
can compete with the best. 
And what more, really, could 
Michigan have asked for?

Minnesota will view this 

weekend as a bitter loss. 
Michigan should view it as a 
win.

Following the weekend, the 

Wolverines are likely to earn 
a top-20 ranking for the first 
time this season. Even so, the 
team is continuing to raise 
the bar regarding its personal 
expectations.

“Yeah, you know we got a 

lot of confidence, but we got 
to keep moving forward,” 
Lockwood said. “We’re not 
going to settle for that, we 
aren’t going to settle for a win 
and a loss. We’re going to take 
that as a 1-1 weekend, and 
going into next weekend try to 
sweep.”

Of course this is the mindset 

Michigan has to maintain to 
prevent missing a step in the 
Big Ten — especially with a 
series against No. 7 Wisconsin 
next weekend.

But for the first time this 

season, the Wolverines have 
quieted their critics. They 
showed they can score, even 
when pressed for time. They 
can fight back from large 
deficits. They can keep up with 
top competitors.

As for that predetermined 

image?

Michigan just notched four 

points against the fourth-
ranked team in the nation.

Wolverines top Northwestern, clinch spot in Final Four

“Magical.”
That was the word Michigan 

coach Marcia Pankratz used to 
describe junior forward Emma 
Way after her hat trick led the 
Wolverines to a 3-0 win over 
Northwestern in the NCAA 
Tournament quarterfinals.

From 
the 
beginning, 

Michigan seemed to have the 
Wildcats under its spell.

The 
Wolverines 
fought 

off 
Northwestern’s 
early 

possession lead and took the 
ball down the field. Way tipped 
in a diagonal pass from fifth-
year 
senior forward 
Carly 

Bennett for her first goal.

“Attacking-wise we could 

take 
a 
couple 
more 
risks 

(after the goal),” said senior 
goalkeeper Sam Swenson. “So 
it was a nice little cushion.”

One of those risks was in 

Michigan’s 
passing. 
After 

having the majority of their 
passes blocked by Syracuse’s 
defense in the round of 16, 
the Wolverines found more 
success Sunday through their 
triangular passing formation. 
Senior back Katie Trombetta 
stood directly in front of 
Swenson to receive passes 
when other players weren’t 
open.

“Since we’ve played (the 

Wildcats) three times now, we 
had an idea of what they do on 
their breakout,” Way said. “We 
did a very good job of stepping 
in front of every ball that was 
passed to us.”

Four 
minutes 
into 
the 

second half, Way did just that, 
positioning herself well for 
freshman 
midfielder 
Kayla 

Reed’s pass. She knocked it in 
the cage to extend the lead to 
2-0.

Way’s 
third 
goal 
was 

perhaps the most impressive 

of all, as she dove to receive 
a pass, then tipped the ball 
right through Northwestern 
goalkeeper Annie Kalfa’s legs.

“She has magical hands, and 

it was evident today,” Pankratz 
said. “We needed it.”

But the Wildcats weren’t 

letting up easily. They put the 
Wolverines’ defense to the test 
by drawing three consecutive 
penalty corners. After the 
first two shots were blocked, 
Northwestern 
attempted 
a 

direct shot. Swenson, though, 
was there to make the save.

“Our 
corner 
(defense) 

executed 
really 
well,” 

Swenson said. “We’re really 
focused because they are very 
dangerous on corners.”

The Wildcats’ speed wasn’t 

a problem for the Wolverines. 
They 
knew 
Northwestern’s 

strategy was to play quickly, 
and they were prepared.

A 
quick 
shot 
by 

Northwestern 
midfielder 

Kaitlin Wood looked like a 
surefire goal, but Swenson 
made it there first, using her 
leg to block the shot.

“The final foray at the end, 

(the defense) managed it really 
well,” 
Swenson 
said. 
“We 

weathered the storm.”

One 
final 
blocked 
shot 

sealed the win and a spot in the 
Final Four against Maryland.

“I’m so excited,” Swenson 

said. “I think we can do special 
things.”

Maybe 
it 
was 
time 
for 

Michigan to save Sam Swenson 
for once, instead of the other way 
around.

As the active NCAA leader in 

career save percentage — both 
this year and for her career— the 
senior goalkeeper has bailed out 
the Wolverines time and time 
again. Swenson stands on top 
of one mountain of success. But 
she’s looking at a higher one: an 
NCAA Championship.

Before Saturday’s 1-0 overtime 

win against Syracuse, Michigan 
only had one NCAA Tournament 
win during Swenson’s tenure— a 
2-1 win over Wake Forest in 2015. 

Even that year, Michigan lost its 
next game, 1-0 to No. 2 North 
Carolina.

“It 
means 
everything,” 

Swenson said. “I mean we had a 
close chance a couple years ago, 
so to finally do that it feels really 
great. We have a really special 
team, so it’s really extra nice to 
do it with them this year.”

With time expiring in the 

first half, Syracuse was in prime 
position to score the first goal of a 
gritty, defensive game off a corner. 
As the Orange lobbed a 45-degree 
shot toward the right side of the 
goal, Swenson stretched out her 
leg and deflected the shot outside 
the right post with her shin pad.

Eight 
minutes 
later, 
the 

goalkeeper stopped a Syracuse 

shot cold in its tracks inches 
away from the goal. Regardless, 
Swenson deferred praise of the 
Wolverines’ defensive prowess 
Saturday afternoon to Michigan’s 
back line and the rest of her 
teammates.

“Our back line is incredible,” 

Swenson said. “But really, the 
back line starts with the forwards 
and the forwards did a great job 
of keeping the ball pressed up 
high. Especially when there were 
corner balls, we almost always 
turned it over.”

“We put a lot of pressure on 

them if they messed it up because 
they put that pressure on our 
backfield. And we were there to 
pick it up. Katie (Trombetta) did 
a great job today, and Maggie 
(Bettez) and Halle (O’Neill) also 
did.”

Swenson 
didn’t 
have 
to 

shoulder the load after that. 
Syracuse 
didn’t 
even 
take 

another 
shot 
on 
goal 
after 

45-minute mark, as the back line 
of the junior and freshman duo of 
Bettez and O’Neill walled off the 
Orange’s attackers.

The senior goalkeeper got to 

do something that she hadn’t 
been able to do before: watch her 
offense work. Swenson noted 
after the game how happy she 
was to see the offense close out 
the game after 77 minutes of 
strong defense.

“I felt like it was gonna come,” 

Swenson said. “I think we were 
really patient, we worked it 
around the back, and then Meg 
(Dowthwaite) obviously tipped 
it in. It was a great goal and I felt 
like we deserved it, and obviously, 
I was really excited, I don’t think 
I’ve ever run so fast down the 
field. So, yeah, really excited and 
proud of them to finish. They 
deserved it.”

Swenson, for her defensive 

prowess 
throughout 
her 

Wolverine tenure, deserved it 
too.

Way’s hat trick leads Michigan past Wildcats
Swenson keeps ‘M’ afloat, gets deserving win

‘M’ tops Liberty behind stout defensive effort

Katelynn Flaherty snaked 

around the top of the key, 
stopped on a dime and rattled 
the shot. Up on the Crisler 
Center scoreboard, a graphic 
flashed: nine points to go.

Alas, this was not the day 

Flaherty would break Diane 
Dietz’s 
all-time 
scoring 

record. Those were her last 
points of the day. Hold the 
countdown, at least for now.

“I forgot about the record,” 

joked Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico after the game. 
“And then when I took her 
out of the game, someone 
had mentioned to me how 
many points away she was. 
Obviously we knew coming 
into the year Katelynn was 
going to set the record. She’s 
just such a tremendous player. 
But my concern with Katelynn 
right now is making sure she’s 
rested, making sure she has a 
tremendous season, making 
sure she stays injury free.”

Still, the No. 24 Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team 

dominated 
Liberty 
from 

start 
to 
finish 
Sunday, 

winning 74-50 and moving 
on to the preseason WNIT 
semifinals against the winner 
of Louisville and Toledo’s 
matchup Tuesday.

Flaherty’s pursuit of the 

record 
will 
be 
made 
the 

story of this game, but the 
Wolverines’ 
defense 
was 

what 
won 

it 
so 
easily. 

Michigan 
— 
which 

normally plays 
a 
2-3 
zone 

— went to a 
press 
toward 

the end of the 
first 
quarter. 

The 
results 

were 
almost 

immediate. 
Right 
at 

the 
start 
of 

the 
second, 

sophomore 
forward Kayla Robbins picked 
up a deflection, leading to 
a 
10-second 
violation 
on 

Liberty. Just seconds later, 
freshman guard Deja Church 
stole 
the 
ball 
away 
with 

the Lady Flames still in the 
backcourt and laid it up. The 
rout was on.

“Coach Wes (Brooks), it 

was his scout. That was his 
gameplan,” 
Barnes 
Arico 

said. “He thought that if we 
pressured them and made 
them speed up a little bit, it 
would play into our hands. 
That was his call after the 
scout. It was a great call.”

By 
halftime, 

the 
Wolverines 

were up by 20. 
When the third 
quarter 
ended, 

the 
margin 

was 
27. 
When 

the 
final 
horn 

sounded, 
the 

score was 74-50 
and the game not 
as close as that.

Michigan 

forced 17 Liberty 
turnovers, most 
of 
them 
with 

the press. Other 

than freshman forward Hailey 
Brown, 
every 
Wolverine 

starter had at least one steal. 
Even when the Lady Flames 
got it down the court, they 
were near-hapless most of the 
time. When Liberty managed 
to find open shooters, the ball 
seemed to hit air more often 

than net.

In 
addition 
to 
scoring 

20, Flaherty picked up five 
assists. For this being just 
her second ever start at point 
guard, the senior seems to 
be an adept learner. She did 
everything 
from 
beating 

Liberty’s press by finding 
Hallie Thome downcourt for 
a layup to snaking in and out 
of the paint, opening up junior 
guard Nicole Munger for a 
3-pointer.

Munger finished with 13 

points of her own on 3-for-5 
shooting from beyond the arc. 
She also had three steals and 
thrived in the press, picking 
up deflection after deflection 
as the game went on. Michigan 
finished with 26 points off 
turnovers, a good portion of 
those thanks to her.

Sophomore guard Akienreh 

Johnson also saw her first 
extended time on the court 
after suffering an ACL injury 
last season. She came in at the 
start of the second quarter, 
however, didn’t get her name 
on the statsheet until the end 
of the half. Munger nearly 
lost the ball after stealing it 
away from the Lady Flames. 
Johnson, however, took it 
right back and ran down the 
remainder of the court for an 
easy lay-in. Though Johnson 
played only a minute in the 
Wolverines’ opener, the 15 she 
had Sunday were a step-up 
from than the feeling-out time 
she had previously.

“It was just great to see her 

out there,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She’s worked incredibly hard 
and she’s had some setbacks. 
To watch her battle back, and 
her perseverance, was just 
inspirational to us all.”

In all likelihood, Michigan 

will get its first big test of 
the year Thursday. Louisville 
— their opponents barring a 
massive upset — is the ninth-
ranked team in the country, 
and Michigan will go on the 
road to play them.

However, the Wolverines 

have passed their first two 
tests, and done so with flying 
colors.

Senior guard Katelynn Flaherty came nine points shy of becoming Michigan’s all-time leading scorer Sunday afternoon.

He thought that 
if we pressured 
them and made 
them speed up a 
little bit, it would 

play into our 

hands.

MEN’S SOCCER
Wolverines falter in 
Big Ten Tournament

One whistle blew, Michigan 

forward 
Francis 
Atuahene 

restarted the match after a 
fourth Wisconsin goal, and 
a second later, three more 
sounded, signaling the end of 
the top-seeded Wolverines’ Big 
Ten Tournament dream run.

Moments earlier, Wisconsin 

forward Alex Alfaro had put the 
final dagger in a disappointing 
afternoon for the Michigan 
men’s soccer team, as his goal 
with one second remaining put 
the Badgers up 4-0.

Michigan’s hopes of a Big 

Ten Tournament title took its 
largest blow with 15 minutes 
remaining. With the Wolverines 
dominating 
possession 
but 

trailing 1-0, a bad back pass 
from Wisconsin put freshman 
forward 
Mohammed 
Zakyi 

through on goal with a chance 
to equalize.

A great save from keeper 

Philipp Schilling saw the ball 
fall to a Wisconsin defender, 
who played a long ball over the 
top to forward Chris Mueller. 
Mueller cut past two Michigan 
defenders 
and 
finished 
to 

the far post — all but sealing 
the Badgers’ victory, merely 
seconds after it looked like 
their lead was finally going to 
fall.

“We thought that was the 

equalizer,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Chaka Daley. “Then off 
of that, they came straight back 
on top of us and we lost a little 
bit of focus and they scored off 
that play. … (It) definitely took 
the wind out of our sails a little 
bit.”

Wisconsin 
opened 
the 

scoring 29 minutes into the 
match when a cross fell loose 
in the box after a Badger striker 
landed on top of freshman 
goalkeeper Henry Mashburn. 
The 
opportunity 
didn’t 
go 

wasted, as the ball was slotted 
home with Mashburn still lying 
hopelessly on the ground.

Mashburn 
found 
himself 

on the ground again for the 
Badgers’ third goal, as he 
slipped while taking a free 
kick, ultimately allowing Tom 
Barlow to finish into an empty 
net.

Despite 
the 
loss, 
the 

12th-ranked Wolverines have 
a favorable chance to make the 
NCAA Tournament for the first 
time since 2012, especially given 
their regular season conference 
title. But they still must await 
the 
selection 
committee’s 

decision on whether they have 
done enough to earn one of 16 
first-round byes.

“We 
have 
some 
top 
25 

results, big wins,” Daley said. 
“We’re in a great position to be 
in the NCAA Tournament so 
whether or not we’re in the first 
round or we get a bye, I think 
that’s what we were trying to 
cement today.”

In order to make its impact 

felt 
in 
the 
tournament, 

Michigan will have to re-group 
from what was its first loss since 
Oct. 10 and most lopsided loss 
of the season. Daley, though, 
isn’t concerned.

“I’m 
confident 
that 
the 

guys will regroup from the 
(Big Ten Tournament),” Daley 
said, “which was a little bit 
of a disappointment, and get 
our minds right for the NCAA 
Tournament, 
which 
is 
the 

ultimate prize.”

And 
while 
Friday 
may 

have been a let down for the 
red-hot Wolverines, Daley is 
determined to not let his team 
lose the focus that led them 
to his most successful regular 
season in Ann Arbor.

“I’m positive that the group 

will be re-invigorated.” Daley 
said. “It’s exhausting to go 
through the regular season and 
win the title the way we won, 
which is something new for 
them. … A loss at the end of the 
season on a neutral site doesn’t 
necessarily 
distinguish 
our 

body of work, which has been 
really, really good.”

One quarter and an exodus

C

OLLEGE PARK — A 
streak of red remained 
in section 12, if only 

because they were obligated to.

That group was the “Mighty 

Sound 
of 

Maryland” 
Marching 
Band. 
The 

scene around 
them, 
though, was 
far 
more 

depressing. 
There 
were 

a whole lot 
of 
empty 

seats. 
The 

ones that weren’t empty, well, 
fans clad in maize and blue 
primarily filled those.

And really, it’d be hard to 

blame the Maryland faithful 
for making the exodus after 
the second quarter that the 
Terrapins had.

“I felt like we definitely were 

clicking all together that first 
half,” said fifth-year senior 
defensive 
tackle 
Maurice 

Hurst. “It felt like everything 
was sort of working to our 

advantage. … I definitely saw 
us, at least in the first half, sort 
of clicking on all cylinders.

“We were doing a great job. I 

felt like we were a hard team to 
play against when we’re doing 
what we’re supposed to and 
everyone’s producing, scoring 
points, getting off the field. 
… That was the first time I’ve 
seen us click all together.”

Hurst isn’t wrong, but it 

started with a questionable 
decision. Maryland coach D.J. 
Durkin elected to fake a punt 
on 4th-and-7 from his own 
30-yard line. The Terrapins 
trailed by just 14, and the 
Wolverines stopped the play 
firmly in its tracks.

Brandon Peters subsquently 

threw a touchdown pass.

On the next drive, the 

referee reversed a 29-yard pass 
to Taivon Jacobs, ruling that 
the Maryland receiver hadn’t 
maintained possession of the 
ball. It was Maryland’s best 
play of the game to that point, 
but things changed quickly in 
the second quarter Saturday 
night. Durkin didn’t dare fake 

another punt, and it didn’t 
matter. Josh Metellus barreled 
into the backfield, blocked the 
punt and Michigan recovered.

Peters completed a pass to 

the end zone again.

The 
Terrapins 
finally 

showed life on their next 
drive, only to see Ryan Brand 
get picked off by David Long — 
who returned the interception 
80 yards.

There 
was 
no 
Peters 

touchdown pass this time. 
Quinn Nordin missed from 31 
yards, and Maryland rushed 
twice for three yards to end 
the half.

So began the march toward 

the exits, and there was plenty 
of reason to leave.

After all, the majority of the 

cheering came after Quinn 
Nordin’s extra points flew, 
undeterred by a net, into the 
student section.

A year after being blown 

out by 56 in Ann Arbor, the 
Terrapins looked well on their 
way to a repeat occurrence at 
home.

And 
for 
one 
reason 
or 

another, Maryland made that 
easy — the Wolverines had to 
start only one drive in their 
half of the field.

“That’s big time for an 

offense,” 
said 
redshirt 

sophomore tight end Zach 
Gentry. “It gives us so much 
confidence just because we’re 
working on such a short field. 
Credit to our special teams and 
our defense there, because we 
got a short field a lot of times 
and it just led right to scores 
for the most part.”

Added 
sophomore 

cornerback 
David 
Long: 

“We’re always kind of like one 
play away. Our coach always 
talks about that, so we’re 
just trying to hone in on just 
winning every rep, winning 
every play. And so I think we 
really did that that second 
quarter.”

That they did, and to make 

matters worse, Eyabi Anoma 
— the top-ranked recruit in 
the state who has offers from 
both Maryland and Michigan 
— was at Capital One Field at 
Maryland Stadium to see it all.

Anoma, however, may have 

seen one thing that those 
who left did not. Maryland 
outgained Michigan 228 to 93 
in the second half, averaging 
6.9 yards per play. That’s not 
to say the Wolverines didn’t 
deserve to win, because they 
undoubtedly did.

But the second half was ugly, 

and Michigan won its matchup 
in College Park during the 
second quarter.

Then again, there’s nothing 

wrong with that. After all, it 
was that quarter in which the 
Wolverines’ three phases came 
together in conjunction. And 
it was that quarter that left 
Maryland’s band look like an 
outlier among a sea of empty 
aluminum.

Peters, tight ends finding chemistry

COLLEGE PARK — Just last 

week, Sean McKeon was on one 
end of a missed connection.

The sophomore tight end was 

wide open across the middle of 
the field. His quarterback, though, 
was busy taking a crushing sack — 
a hit that left him slow to get up. 
So McKeon ran over, and as good 
friends do, had some fun with 
Brandon Peters.

“... I was just mad because I was 

open on a crossing route for the first 
down,” McKeon recalled, grinning, 
after Michigan’s 33-10 win over 
Minnesota. “I was like, ‘Man, were 
you going to throw it to me on that 
crosser?’ (Peters) was like, ‘I was 
about to, but then I got hit.’ I was 
like, ‘Aw, man. That’s alright.’”

The two wouldn’t miss the same 

opportunity against Maryland on 
Saturday afternoon. In the second 
quarter, the Wolverines called a play-
action pass on 1st-and-goal from 
the three-yard line. Peters rolled 
out, McKeon sprinted across the 
formation into the flats and the two 
hooked up for as easy of a touchdown 
as they’ll have all season.

Of course, Peters and McKeon 

are no Hall and Oates. But there’s 
still a burgeoning connection 
between the two classmates — 
and between Peters and his other 
favorite tight end target, Zach 

Gentry.

“Sean McKeon, heck of a 

football player, Zach Gentry’s 
blossoming, heck of a football 
player,” said Jim Harbaugh. “... I 
think we’re doing a very good job 
at the tight end position. Blocking, 
catching, assignments are good, 
no penalties, we’re not turning the 
ball over. Kind of football we like.”

Before Maryland, Michigan’s 

tight ends had just two touchdowns 
on the season. Now, they have 
double that after McKeon’s three-
yard snag followed a 33-yard bullet 
down the seam to Gentry on the 
previous drive.

Peters hasn’t thrown all that 

often when he’s played. But when 
he does, chances are he’s looking 
for his biggest and burliest pass-
catchers. McKeon led the team 
in receptions and receiving yards 
against Rutgers and Minnesota. 
He’s in the midst of a seven-game 
catch streak, longest on the team, 
and is first on the team with 25 
receptions and second with 256 
receiving yards.

On 
Saturday, 
though, 
his 

teammate took over the spotlight. 
It was Gentry who led the team 
in both receptions and receiving 
yards with three for 63.

Gentry’s score may have been 

easier than McKeon’s. It was 
the first play following a failed 
fake punt. Maryland stacked the 
box with eight, Peters read the 

defense and Gentry found himself 
celebrating his second touchdown 
of the year.

“Yeah, so the one over the 

middle, their safety was just 
playing way back side and the seam 
just popped,” Peters said.

Added Gentry: “I thought it 

was a good play call. I knew there 
was a chance I was going to get 
the ball. Brandon did an excellent 
job reading the defense — read the 
safety, who went away from me, 
and it just opened up.”

Peters said Michigan uses the 

tight ends “a lot” in the passing 
game and that they’re “always 
working” on releases and route 
timing. The extra effort has clearly 
paid off. Whereas Michigan’s 
receivers have stalled, recording 
just nine catches for 59 yards 
with no touchdowns over the past 
three games, the tight ends have 
flourished.

Yet Gentry didn’t think there 

was any particular emphasis on 
throwing to the tight ends. To 
him, his position group’s success 
has been simple: a product of both 
Peters and how opposing defenses 
have lined up.

“I don’t know if there’s anything 

really different that we do with 
Brandon where he’s targeting us 
more,” Gentry said. “I just think 
that he’s making some good reads 
and the secondary just gave us a 
good look.”

Redshirt sophomore tight end Zach Gentry led Michigan with three receptions for 63 yards and one touchdown.

FOOTBALL
Nordin continues to 
struggle at Maryland

COLLEGE PARK — With a 

minute left in the second half, 
Quinn Nordin trotted out for 
a field goal. The Michigan 
football team led 28-0, and the 
Wolverines’ redshirt freshman 
kicker lined up for a 31-yard 
kick.

With no wind, no rain and 

no excuses, Nordin booted 
the ball wide to the right of 
the post — his third straight 
missed field goal.

After 
the 
miss, 
Nordin 

walked 
off 
the 
field 
and 

exchanged 
words 
with 

coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh. 
On 

the television broadcast, it 
appeared that Nordin yelled 
back at Harbaugh, but the 
coach insisted otherwise in his 
post game press conference.

Harbaugh elaborated on the 

conversation with Nordin after 
Michigan’s 35-10 win over the 
Terrapins.

“Start 
making 
them,” 

Harbaugh said to his young 
kicker.

He later added: “He didn’t 

really snap back. I said to 
(Nordin), ‘I’m giving you one 
more shot. You’ve got to make 
the next one.’ And he said, ‘I 
got this. I will make the next 
one.’ ”

In the last four games, 

Nordin has gone 0-for-3 on 
field-goal attempts and missed 
two extra points over that span 
as well. His recent struggles 
have provided a sharp contrast 
to 
the 
season’s 
first 
four 

games, when he hit 11 of 13 
field-goal attempts to carry 
the 
Wolverines’ 
inadequate 

offense.

Harbaugh 
didn’t 
see 

exactly 
what 
went 
wrong 

with Nordin’s field-goal miss 
Saturday against Maryland, 
but 
he 
mentioned 
that 
it 

might have been a protection 
formation that the Terrapins’ 
special teams unit flashed at 
the last moment.

Last week, after Nordin 

missed a 49-yard field goal 
against Minnesota, Harbaugh 
said Nordin was kicking too 
fast.

“He’s missed a few now in 

a row, and he’s got to make 
them,” Harbaugh said.

Nordin rose to fame during 

his high school recruitment 
when Harbaugh slept over at his 
house. Once committed to Penn 
State, Nordin flipped to come 
to Michigan. He didn’t play 
last year, as former Wolverine 
Kenny Allen handled all of 
Michigan’s kicking duties, but 
once the 2017 season started, 
Nordin became a fan favorite 
immediately.

He lit up the season opener 

in Dallas with two field goals 
from over 50 yards against 
Florida, and his prominent 
‘Wild Thing’ haircut thrust 
him into the spotlight.

A few weeks ago, a clip of 

Nordin hitting a field goal 
even showed up in the second 
game of the World Series. 
Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher 
Rich Hill, who is a Michigan 
alum, is known for his unique 
pitching motion that involves a 
huge leg swing.

It’s been that kind of year 

for Nordin. Just as quickly as 
he became a fan favorite, he’s 
become a target for discontent.

Harbaugh told Nordin after 

the miss that he wouldn’t 
replace him as the team’s 
kicker unless he missed again. 
Nordin only had one more 
kick to take — an extra point 
in the fourth quarter — and he 
converted.

Nordin will need to make his 

field goals, too, or Harbaugh 
won’t have any reason to keep 
sending him out there.
