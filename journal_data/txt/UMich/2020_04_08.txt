In recent weeks, businesses 

have closed their doors and 

restaurants have been forced to 

move to takeout only as residents 

have taken to self-isolation, all to 

slow the spread of COVID-19 as 

the Center for Disease Control 

and 
Prevention’s 
guidelines 

recommend. However, homeless 

shelters in Ann Arbor remain 

open, in full operation and at 

capacity.

Sarah Paspal-Jasinski, director 

of development at the Shelter 

Association of Washtenaw County, 

said day-to-day operations have 

shifted completely in response 

to the coronavirus. Two people 

housed at the Delonis Center, 

located on Huron Street, tested 

positive for COVID-19 in late 

March. Since then, they have been 

moved to the hospital. 

Paspal-Jasinski said SAWC has 

expanded the facilities to local 

hotels in order to provide more 

shelter for people experiencing 

housing 
insecurity 
while 

maintaining 
social 
distancing 

guidelines. 
In 
addition, 
they 

recently hired more staff in 

response to the crisis. 

“We’re continuing to try and 

house people so that they are not 

forced into homelessness, but it’s 

not as easy or as manageable as 

it was prior to this pandemic,” 

Paspal-Jasinski said. “Our mission 

has temporarily changed from 

ending homelessness one person 

at a time to providing shelter for 

anyone that needs it.” 

She 
also 
explained 
the 

difficulty 
shelters 
face 
in 

complying with social distancing 

recommendations. 
In 
each 

bedroom, there are three to four 

beds. While each bed is spaced 

six feet apart, there is still a risk 

involved.

The 
Michigan 
state 

legislature 
convened 
in 

Lansing on Tuesday and voted 

to prolong Michigan’s state of 

emergency. 

The extension is 23 days, 

until April 30, instead of 70, 

as Michigan Gov. Gretchen 

Whitmer 
said 
last 
week 

was her desired extension. 

However, under the Emergency 

Management Act, she needs the 

legislature to vote to extend the 

declaration.

Michigan Medicine workers catch virus

More than 100 employees at the hospital have tested positive for COVID-19 as of Monday

728 
Michigan 
Medicine 

employees have been tested for 

COVID-19 and 110 of those tests 

have come back positive as of 

Monday, according to a press 

release from Michigan Medicine.

“Importantly, 
please 
note 

these 
numbers 
don’t 
indicate 

how or where those who tested 

positive contracted the disease,” 

the release reads. “The numbers 

reflect just those who sought 

testing at Michigan Medicine or 

those hospitalized at Michigan 

Medicine.”

Some 
Michigan 
Medicine 

employees may have been tested 

outside 
the 
system, 
and 
are 

therefore not counted in these 

numbers. Fewer than 10 of the 

employees were hospitalized for a 

day or more.

In a video announcement on 

Thursday, Jeff Desmond, chief 

medical 
officer 
at 
Michigan 

Medicine, addressed the concerns 

about medical professionals being 

kept safe from exposure to COVD-

19. Desmond explained the use of 

personal protective equipment and 

its importance in keeping medical 

professionals safe. He noted that 

Michigan Medicine is taking all of 

the necessary precautions advised 

by the Centers for Disease Control 

and Prevention.

“We 
currently 
have 
enough 

personal 
protective 
equipment 

and we have adequate, appropriate 

PPE in all our locations. That 

said, we are also taking steps to 

appropriately conserve PPE so that 

will last through this pandemic,” 

Desmond said. “Second, Michigan 

Medicine made the decision to have 

our entire employee population 

wear masks during work on March 

23, 10 days ago. This was done to 

prevent potential spread within 

the organization and was focused 

on keeping our employees safe. We 

were one of the first health systems 

in the country to adopt this policy.”

Katie 
Oppenheim, 
chair 
of 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

Professional Nurse Council, spoke 

to The Daily about the safety of 

fellow medical professionals and 

the difficulty of getting access to 

testing for the public.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

During the ongoing coronavirus 

pandemic, 
students 
and 
young 

professionals from around the world 

have come together to form a global 

movement called #Students_Against_

COVID, 
which 
is 
dedicated 
to 

bringing students and allies together 

to spread awareness about the severity 

of the virus. They strive to facilitate 

effective and socially responsible 

collaboration and innovation while 

working to champion scientifically-

based principles.

U-M alum Alina Haque, media 

outreach 
coordinator 
of 
SAC, 

described 
how 
she 
started 
the 

movement with her sister, Marina 

Haque, a 2020 dual Medical Doctor 

and 
Master 
of 
Public 
Health 

candidate 
at 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan. On March 16, she tweeted 

asking students to share what they 

were doing regarding the COVID-19 

crisis using the hashtag #Students_

Against_COVID so people would be 

better able to connect.

“My sister started receiving more 

and more responses from student 

activists around the world who were 

eager to share and connect what they 

were doing to help with the COVID 

crisis,” 
Alina 
Haque 
responded. 

“One of the first persons to connect 

with her was a medical student from 

Greece, who helped bring in several 

more health care students around the 

globe. Together, they decided to make 

a platform for all students and allies 

to more effectively collaborate.”

In an email to The Daily, Marina 

Haque said her primary motivation 

for starting the movement is to spread 

knowledge and credible information. 

“The movement strives to champion 

science, foster inclusion, and support 

healthcare 
workers 
during 
this 

critical time,” Marina Haque wrote. 

“A lot of what we are seeing happening 

around us in the world is because 

people did not listen to scientists. A 

lot of people worldwide are dying, and 

now, more than ever, is the time to 

listen to scientists and quite frankly, 

keep listening to scientists.” 

Alina Haque said the platform first 

started as a simple WhatsApp group 

chat but quickly expanded as people 

began taking on new initiatives.

“Someone would say, ‘I’m really 

interested in helping with a mental 

health 
initiative,’ 
and 
they 
will 

make their own separate group chat 

and report back to a team of lead 

facilitators,” Alina Haque said. “And 

someone else will say, ‘I’m really 

interested 
in 
collecting 
personal 

protective equipment,’ and they will 

make their own group chat.”

All of these small groups fall under 

the umbrella of Students Against 

COVID. Currently, the group consists 

of more than 150 students and spans 

across more than 40 countries.

When Ana Sofia Mota, a final 

year medical student in Lisbon, 

Portugal, first joined SAC, she said 

she was surprised by both the scale 

of the movement and the amount of 

coordination involved.

“I was overwhelmed by how big it 

was,” Mota said. “I got into WhatsApp, 

and I see so many messages, and I was 

saying, ‘What’s happening? How can 

these people be so efficient?’ They are 

all so different, yet they work together 

so well.”

Alina Haque said the main goal 

of SAC is to spread awareness about 

the severity of the crisis and offer 

educational information regarding 

COVID-19.

“One thing that we have is a 

translation 
team,” 
Alina 
Haque 

said. “They collectively speak 25+ 

languages to try to ensure our content 

is widely accessible. We’ve created 

COVID-19 informational flyers, for 

example, and paired with other health 

literacy movements to help widely 

disseminate information.”

Lolita Matishova, a second-year 

internal medicine intern at Kharkiv 

Medical Academy in Ukraine and a 

member of the translation team, said 

a platform like SAC is crucial to keep 

people informed during this time of 

crisis.

“We are students with a lot 

of information, and we use this 

platform to spread that information,” 

Matishova said. “What’s even more 

important is that we also translated 

them into different languages, so 

other people can read them in their 

own language without any challenge.”

One of SAC’s recent efforts was 

the SafeHand challenge video, which 

had members from around the world 

demonstrating correct hand-washing 

techniques.

Aman Tahir, an incoming U-M 

student and part of the SAC media 

team, 
expressed 
her 
excitement 

at seeing a collective global effort 

unfold, particularly when watching 

the SafeHand video for the first time.

“It was an inspiring educational 

video, compiled by talented people 

from around the globe,” Tahir said. 

“I felt immense joy watching the 

video knowing that there are such 

amazing people in this movement 

who have spectacular ideas and 

execution of projects. I know that this 

organization has so much in store, 

and I am optimistic about its future 

endeavors.”

SAC 
members 
not 
only 
work 

within 
SAC-managed 
platforms 

but are often part of various other 

forms of COVID-related activism 

in their local communities. Ramsha 

Akhund, a medical student at Aga 

Khan University Hospital in Karachi, 

Pakistan and SAC member, is also 

involved with a local relief effort 

called The Student Taskforce Against 

COVID-19.

“We helped set up a helpline in the 

hospital so the students can answer 

questions on-call,” Akhund said, “So 

that the health workers can focus on 

the front line and students can help 

behind the scenes.”

Alina 
Haque 
mentioned 
a 

collaborative effort with MedSupply 

Drive to collect personal protective 

equipment for local hospitals and 

health workers.

This decision has no impact on 

Whitmer’s 
stay-at-home 
order, 

which is still set to end April 14. 

Whitmer told reporters after the 

vote that the extension isn’t as long 

as she hoped, but the legislature 

can always extend it again at a later 

date, according to the Detroit Free 

Press. Whitmer said extending the 

emergency declaration protects 

the state from civil liability for 

actions taken by first responders. 

“We don’t agree on the length 

of the emergency – the action they 

took today,” Whitmer said. “That’s 

their decision. They can come back 

as much as they want to, even if it is 

contrary to the best practices.” 

State Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann 

Arbor, told The Daily he felt there 

was no real purpose to the vote 

as Whitmer had the executive 

authority to legally extend the 

declaration by 22 days.

“It was a voice vote to basically 

extend by 23 days the governor’s 

executive 
order,” 
Rabhi 
said. 

“There is some legal disagreement 

about how much of an impact that 

will actually have. The governor 

pretty much has maintained that 

she did not need the legislature 

to convene, who extended her 

authority that she already had 

… 
The 
legislature’s 
resolution 

extends her powers until the 30th 

… Which only really has the effect, 

in the end, of giving her one extra 

day.”

Rabhi said the legislature should 

convene for measures that have a 

more concrete effect.

“If we have to meet during this 

crisis, we should be voting on items 

that have a real impact,” Rabhi 

said. 
“There 
were 
alternative 

resolutions offered today that 

would 
have 
actually 
had 
a 

substantive effect.”

Rabhi explained Whitmer has 

been pulling her authority from 

three laws: the Constitution, the 

Emergency Powers of Governor 

Act 302 of 1945 and the Emergency 

Management Act 390 of 1976. 

He noted the 1945 act does not 

have time limitations, but the 

1976 statute limits the governor’s 

authority to an initial 28 days and 

requires the legislature to vote to 

extend it. 

There is a legal disagreement 

within the legislature, according 

to Rabhi, because the two statutes 

conflict with each other on the 

length of the governor’s authority. 

The 
Emergency 
Powers 
of 

Governor Act is in effect until the 

governor declares the emergency 

no longer exists. 

“Combining, 
essentially, 
all 

of that case law, you have the 

situation 
where 
the 
governor 

took a broad approach in terms of 

citations for her executive orders 

that she could rely on, a number of 

different statutes for the powers 

that she has,” Rabhi said. “Again, 

under the 1945 Emergency Powers 

of the Governor Act, there is no 

time limit. And so there is a legal 

argument that can be made that 

she could continue to exercise her 

powers until the emergency has 

expired, until the emergency is 

deemed to be over by her.”

Rabhi said he felt Tuesday’s 

meeting was political, as many of 

Michigan’s Democratic members 

wanted 
to 
grant 
the 
70-day 

extension 
Whitmer 
wanted, 

while the Republicans preferred a 

shorter extension. 

State 
Sen. 
Mike 
Shirkey, 

R-Clarklake, said in a statement 

last week that while he does think 

the emergency order should be 

extended, 70 days was too much 

time.

“We 
agree 
that 
emergency 

circumstances 
persist 
in 
our 

state and are prepared to support 

an extension of the governor’s 

emergency declaration, but feel 

a 70-day extension is too long,” 

Shirkey said. 

Rabhi said he felt the legal 

discussion 
that 
took 
place 

today for this vote will likely 

be continued after this 23-day 

extension is over. 

“And 
so 
after 
April 
30, 

essentially, starting May 1, there 

could be a legal battle if the 

legislature chooses to not to re-up 

or extend her powers under the 

emergency manager act, she could 

still assert her authority through 

the Emergency Powers of the 

Governor Act,” Rabhi said. “... And 

that’s sort of some of the things 

that happened today. I would 

describe it as a little bit more 

theater, a little bit less substance.”

According to The Daily’s data, 

which pulls from the Michigan 

government, Michigan has 18,970 

cases as of April 7.

“It is challenging to even get 

tested,” Oppenheim said. “The 

criteria are pretty rigid. People 

have been denied getting tested 

for a number of reasons. It is 

hoped that it is going to change 

any day now where easy, quick 

testing will be available at the 

health system. Hopefully, they 

will have thousands of people so 

that we can see the trajectory for 

this.”

Michigan Medicine nurses at 

high risk of contracting the virus 

have struggled to obtain testing, 

noting the difficulty of caring for 

patients during a pandemic and 

weighing the benefits of staying 

home from work when there is 

a shortage of qualified medical 

professionals.

Oppenhiem also acknowledged 

the need to monitor for symptoms, 

especially 
among 
those 
who 

are on the front lines of this 

pandemic. 

“There’s no special treatment 

for 
anybody 
about 
testing, 

health care providers, anybody 

that works in the institution, 

everybody is treated the same 

based on symptoms,” Oppenhiem 

said. “The only time you stay 

home is if you are symptomatic, 

so if you were exposed and are 

completely asymptomatic, then 

you’re just going to monitor your 

temperature 
and 
continue 
to 

work.”

Symptoms 
of 
coronavirus 

include fever, cough and shortness 

of breath. People who think they 

may have been exposed to the 

virus should call their primary 

care physician. Individuals can 

also 
contact 
the 
Washtenaw 

County Health Department at

“My mom is a health care 

provider,” Alina Haque said. “So, 

I am very passionate about trying 

to help my local hospital collect 

PPE. With the use of the hashtag, 

I was able to connect with others 

to make a team here to collate 

PPE. We started calling places 

to ask for donations. We are also 

collecting thank-you cards and 

notes from our community to 

post in the staff entrance of the 

hospital to help boost morale.”

Marina Haque acknowledged 

the 
health 
risk 
associated 

with 
these 
efforts, 
and 
she 

recommended 
professional 

oversight for anyone who wants to 

initiate similar actions. She noted 

the importance of including these 

voices, as her group has done, 

when planning to ensure they are 

acting responsibly. 

“Within 
Students 
Against 

COVID, 
we 
strongly 
believe 

that 
any 
all 
public 
health 

efforts or social services that 

potentially pose a public health 

risk (i.e. supplies rationing, food 

distribution, etc) should be led by 

or at least overseen by a certified 

health professional or someone 

capable of interpreting scientific 

guidelines,” Marina Haque wrote. 

“These are the messages that we 

are trying to spread in our local 

and global communities; that 

yes, students can make incredible 

contributions to society during 

this time, but please do so 

responsibly.”

SAC also aims to address the 

mental health challenges COVID-

19 and social-distancing through 

a 30-day self-care quarantine 

challenge on social media.

“This brings in a sense of 

community,” 
Akhund 
said. 

“Everyone did something similar 

today. They are as simple as 

creating a playlist or cleaning up 

your drawer and then sharing the 

things they found or things they 

were looking for. Just little things 

that we put up to bring people 

together.”

Alina Haque said SAC has 

become a community for students 

around the world. 

“The message I would want to 

give is that you are not alone,” 

Alina Haque said. “Even though 

we might be literally alone in our 

own houses, you are not alone. 

There are people who are going 

through the same emotions and 

the same experience.”

Matishova said that though the 

pandemic has interrupted her 

education, joining SAC has given 

her a way to offer help and be 

productive.

“I met a lot of people at the 

start of the movement and as the 

movement spread who wanted 

to help people,” Matishova said. 

“And it is really inspiring for me. 

It’s also a really good thing that 

I get to do something, because 

I am in quarantine, and I can’t 

work with my patients. And this 

way I can still help my friends, my 

family and my colleagues to have 

some information.”

Mota said SAC inspired her 

and showed her people from 

around the globe are capable of 

collaborating and working toward 

the greater good.

“This is proof that we can 

work 
together,” 
Mota 
said. 

“This is incredible, people work 

together from around the world, 

from countries that I have never 

expected that I will be working 

with. During a time when people 

are stealing medical materials 

from each other, this is really 

important, because it can show 

people who are in charge now 

that we can work together, and 

despite all of our differences, we 

can achieve really cool things.”

In terms of long-run plans for 

SAC, Tahir said she wants the 

organization to continue even 

after the pandemic has been put 

to rest.

“While 
COVID-19 
may 
be 

put out eventually, the next 

pandemic to happen is not an 

if but a when situation,” Tahir 

said. “All the research, hard work 

and dedication put into SAC can 

always be a reminder of how we 

all should be prepared for the 

next pandemic. A continuation 

of efforts will be more beneficial 

than starting from scratch.”

At the current stage, many 

members of SAC say their main 

goal is to make it through the 

current 
COVID-19 
pandemic 

safely and help flatten the curve 

worldwide as much as possible so 

lives can be saved.

“Personally, 
my 
long-term 

goal would be to come out of this 

situation thanking everyone and 

taking everything as a blessing 

and not taking anything granted,” 

Akhund said.

population. Kurtz spoke with The 

Daily about her experience with 

housing insecurity. 

Kurtz said like other vendors 

at Groundcover News, she relies 

on the profits she makes from 

selling papers to fund her living 

expenses. With operations at 

Groundcover News temporarily 

suspended, Kurtz said she is 

worried for those who cannot 

provide for themselves and are 

forced into warming centers. 

Because the COVID-19 crisis has 

forced the organization to halt its 

print production, there is now an 

online subscription option with 

the revenue going to vendors.

Kurtz said based on her own 

experience, she believes it would 

be difficult to comply with social 

distancing guidelines.

“There definitely needs to be 

extra buildings so that people 

are not on top of each other. It’s 

a critical time for there to be 

space and buildings available 

for people who are experiencing 

homelessness,” Kurtz said. “From 

my experience, when I was there, 

everyone was on top of each other. 

There’s no way we would be able 

to practice distancing and being a 

safe distance from other people.”

Kurtz also urged the media 

to focus on the perspectives of 

those 
who 
have 
experienced 

homelessness when covering the 

coronavirus.

“Our voices needed to be out 

there as soon as this crisis broke 

because we were already in 

crisis,” Kurtz said. “Progress has 

just lagged so far behind and we 

are so ill-prepared for this crisis 

and I just hope we’ll learn from 

this going forward. Some of the 

things that are put in place right 

now should have been put in place 

years ago.”

Eric Hufnagel is the executive 

director 
of 
the 
non-profit 

organization, Michigan Coalition 

Against Homelessness. On March 

30, 
Hufnagel 
wrote 
a 
letter 

addressed 
to 
Gov. 
Gretchen 

Whitmer 
that 
both 
thanked 

her for her response to the 

coronavirus 
and 
highlighted 

this need to focus attention on 

the homeless. The letter cited 

a recent study conducted by 

the University of Pennsylvania, 

Boston 
University 
and 
the 

University 
of 
California, 
Los 

Angeles that provides evidence 

that the homeless populations are 

at a greater risk of contracting the 

coronavirus.

“When 
compared 
to 
the 

general population, individuals 

experiencing homelessness are 

twice as likely to be hospitalized, 

two to four times as likely to 

require critical care, and two 

to three times as likely to die,” 

Hufnagel wrote.

M

arch 27 marked the day 

the United States officially 

surpassed 
every 
other 

country in confirmed cases of COVID-19. 

That day alone, over 3,000 people died 

globally, pushing the total death count past 

27,000. And yet, as thousands lose their 

lives every day, I have seen one phrase 

circulate more than almost any other, 

second only to “wash your hands” — “we 

are the virus, and coronavirus is the cure.”

Beside insinuating that the deaths 

of COVID-19 victims are a good thing 

and equating the deceased to parasites 

being incredibly cruel, the statement 

is untrue. Most of the environmental 

“improvements” cited as proof that 

quarantine is healing the Earth actually 

have far simpler answers. The suddenly 

clear, fish-filled Venice canals, for instance, 

aren’t due to any change in water quality; 

it’s because there are no boats to kick 

sediment into the water when everybody 

is home. In some cases, the lack of human 

activity is detrimental to animal life, like 

the monkeys and deer in Asia who are now 

abruptly without their primary source of 

food — tourists — and are now wandering 

hazardous cities in search of replacements.

There 
have 
been 
some 
real 

environmental benefits to the mass 

quarantines, 
though, 
particularly 
a 

decrease in air pollution. However, 

coronavirus-related changes in emissions 

are temporary and relatively small in 

scope. If anything, the changes brought 

by COVID-19, and the responses of our 

institutions, show us just how little the 

average person is to blame for pollution. 

We are not the virus, industrial capitalism 

is. 

Take for instance the air pollution drop. 

The decrease in emissions in Italy and 

China is because their factories have been 

shut down en masse, not because people 

are driving less. Italy even continued to run 

public transportation, as it was deemed 

an “essential service,” and still saw these 

massive emission decreases. Simply put, 

it makes little difference that individuals 

aren’t getting in their cars when 71 

percent of greenhouse gas emissions come 

from only a hundred companies. These 

corporations and the people who run them 

are the virus, not the commuters and car 

owners. 

Coronavirus will ultimately only make 

pollution worse as economic panic tempts 

governments to be even more permissive of 

corporate pollution. The Prime Minister of 

the Czech Republic has already called for 

Europe to “forget about the Green Deal” for 

the economy’s sake — his country happens 

to depend heavily on nuclear power and 

coal. Similarly, President Donald Trump 

has pledged a bailout for the airline 

industry, saying they’ll be “number one” 

in line, all while airlines are on track to 

emit a quarter of the world’s maximum 

manageable amount of carbon (carbon 

budget) by 2050.

We know for a fact that human beings 

are not fundamentally harmful to the 

planet because we’ve been living here for 

hundreds of thousands of years. Indigenous 

people have been living sustainably for as 

long as people have existed, and they still 

are. Now, with most of the world living 

industrially, indigenous people care for 

80 percent of Earth’s biodiversity and 28 

percent of its land, despite being only 5 

percent of the world population. Not only 

can human beings live without irreparably 

polluting the environment — we can live 

in ways that are beneficial to the planet, 

despite what Western environmentalists 

might say. We just need to adopt these 

beneficial practices on a much larger scale, 

and that means ending the harmful ones 

first. 

To call industrial capitalism a virus 

is apt, because it sickens and kills people 

like a virus. It isn’t happenstance that the 

U.S. ranks first in infant mortality, obesity 

and youth poverty and last in sanitation 

and access to water of all the world’s 

developed nations despite having the 

highest GDP. Poverty and social inequality 

kill Americans as often as heart attacks 

and lung cancer, with 4.5 percent of U.S. 

deaths being traced back to poverty. This 

translates to 874,000 Americans who died 

in 2000, a toll over 32 times larger than the 

total COVID-19 death count by March 27. 

These fatal issues in America have only 

gotten worse in the 20 years since 2000. 

Coronavirus is set to combine with these 

already fatal issues in apocalyptic ways. 

The U.S., as of 2017, has 2.6 doctors per 

1,000 people. Compare that to Italy’s 4.0 

doctors per thousand as Italy’s hospitals 

are overwhelmed with dying COVID-19 

patients. Make no mistake: capitalism will 

be the primary reason coronavirus kills 

Americans. A system built on masses of 

impoverished people selling their labor 

to a few business owners ensures that 

workers will work unless they are given 

another way to survive. Unsurprisingly, the 

Families First Coronavirus Response Act 

neglects paid leave for millions. COVID-

19 belongs to a family of viruses we’ve 

known about for a long time, but a vaccine 

doesn’t exist yet — of course, now it will 

take months before one will be developed. 

Still, our government is already itching to 

lift shutdowns and social distancing rules 

so that businesses can operate (and profit) 

normally. Some officials have even said, 

implicitly and explicitly, that the deaths 

caused by relaxing restrictions would be 

worth it for economic recovery.

As of March 17, COVID-19 is projected 

to kill 2.2 million Americans in total. 

This sort of death toll is neither normal 

nor necessary; in China, only 3,331 have 

reportedly died and the number of cases 

has started to stagnate (although this 

number is disputed). Social distancing 

alone is not enough to save lives when some 

don’t have the option and others have no 

health care to save them once they have it, 

and yet even that bare minimum is falling 

by the wayside for the sake of profits. We 

can only hope that this will be the final case 

study against unfettered capitalism before 

we finally learn to care for each other and 

our planet. We’ve all but passed the point of 

no return already.

We are not the virus

J

esus Christ. I think most 

of us can agree we didn’t 

see anything on this scale 

coming. It hasn’t been more 

than a couple weeks since the 

University of Michigan decided 

to suspend in-person classes, and 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently 

decided to join several other 

states and shut down nonessential 

services. More and more people 

in the United States are getting 

infected, and we’ve even passed 

China as the country with the 

most confirmed cases. Each state 

is trying its own methods to limit 

the spread, with the march of 

infections seemingly unstoppable 

at its current rate. Many criticize 

President Donald Trump for his 

refusal to make the hard decisions 

early enough. The bewildering 

thing about this mess is that there’s 

supposedly a presidential race 

running concurrently. If you forgot 

about it, I wouldn’t entirely blame 

you. The news cycle seemingly 

switched from the U.S. presidential 

elections and “Decision 2020” 

to 
exclusively 
covering 
the 

coronavirus, spreading information 

and possibly fear-mongering for 

ratings. Understandably, the focus 

of many citizens is on the ongoing 

pandemic. But where does that 

leave us on the path leading up to 

November?

The 
most 
immediate 

repercussion on the election cycle 

has been the delay in Democratic 

primaries, where former Vice 

President Joe Biden has pulled a 

political upset against the already 

unprecedented early lead of Sen. 

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Biden is now 

projected to win the nomination, a 

position almost nobody would’ve 

predicted just a month ago. The 

most recent state primaries were 

March 17: Arizona, Illinois and 

Florida. I personally hadn’t heard 

anything about them until the day 

after they happened. The news was 

supplanted by the ongoing crises 

in places like China and Italy, as 

the full brunt of the pandemic had 

yet to hit American shores. Ohio 

was also slated to have a primary 

that day, but delayed over early 

concerns about the virus.

Many of the future primaries 

— 14 states and one U.S. territory 

— have been delayed until a later 

date. The Democratic National 

Committee (DNC) is scheduled 

to meet August 17, but the status 

of the convention has been put 

into question. How long will the 

quarantine last? Nobody really 

knows. Trump extended his social 

distancing guidelines until April 

30, but will that be long enough? 

What happens next? We don’t 

know that, either. Not only is the 

primary put in jeopardy, but the 

general election in November is 

at risk as well. As of now, there 

are no plans to change anything 

involving the general, but there 

are still concerns to be addressed. 

Congress has granted the states 

$400 million to prepare for the 

disease-rampant populace voting 

in the general election, but strictly 

defined precautions are nowhere 

to be found. Many politicians fear a 

delay in the election, which is a step 

many countries — such as Chile 

and the U.K. — have already taken 

in their referendums and elections 

to avoid further infections. Trump, 

however, hasn’t made any moves 

toward delaying the election, and 

actually wants us to believe the 

virus will reach its peak before 

April is over.

If we want to find the solution 

and prevent further fatalities 

quickly, the first instinct is to 

follow the leader in damage 

control — which happens to be 

China. Following an autocracy to 

uphold the sanctity of a democracy 

is a strange thing, but these are 

strange times. New cases of 

infection in mainland China have 

nearly stopped, and the Asian 

powerhouse is taking a leading role 

in assisting fellow nations slow the 

spread of the virus. One benefactor 

of Chinese influence seems to 

be Italy, gladly accepting aid 

after European contemporaries 

seemed too busy with their own 

coronavirus struggles to assist 

their neighbors. But as much as it 

would seem topical, I’m not here 

to prescribe a solution to solve 

the issue, rather to try and have 

some foresight for November. 

As the U.S. is engulfed in its own 

crisis, the growing Chinese clout 

poses immediate and long-term 

implications.

But long-term implications are 

for people who aren’t impulsive. 

The short-term is of course the 

standing of Donald Trump, who 

has long stood at odds with the 

Chinese state on a variety of 

issues. Trump is hard-pressed to 

accept any aid from China and has 

tried his own hand at fixing the 

problem. From calling the panic a 

Democratic hoax to supporting a 

$2 trillion stimulus package, he’s 

quickly shifted his positions and 

tried to adjust to the continuous 

stream of bad news. Trump’s 

focus, however, has remained 

surprisingly consistent. He wants 

the economy to stay afloat. In a 

press conference on March 23, 

Trump went on record saying that 

“We have to save these companies. 

These are companies that weren’t 

in trouble three weeks ago, and 

now they’re in trouble because 

of what happened. These are 

great companies, they’re in some 

cases triple-A companies,” giving 

infallible justification for ignoring 

the general populace. Even before 

this $2 trillion stimulus, he was 

dumping money into the stock 

market to avoid a recession.

Trump is put into a volatile 

position this November, as his 

response to this crisis will most 

definitely affect his chances in 

the coming election. He’s handled 

it with the grace of an elephant 

jumping off a skyscraper into a 

backyard pool, but his position 

in the polls remains uncertain. 

In fact, Trump’s rating is rising 

amid the crisis. Trusting polls 

has made a fool of many before, 

but similar polls pitting Trump 

against frontrunner Biden show 

a closing gap between the two. 

Only time will tell if his chances 

were hindered or helped by his 

contemporary decisions, but they 

will certainly define his campaign. 

A 
return 
to 
normalcy 
is 

something that many people 

wanted to come this November, 

but that fickle and uninformed 

dream 
has 
been 
shattered 

regardless of your candidate. The 

future is uncertain and none of us 

could’ve possibly predicted this. 

I don’t have some sweeping and 

all-encompassing 
prescription 

to solve everything I’ve listed in 

this piece, but I want you to stay 

on top of things. Make sure you 

aren’t caught off guard when the 

status quo changes. Stay informed 

and stay alert, and most of all, stay 

home.

Coronavirus and the machine – what about 2020?

Movies are projections. Yes, literally, in the 

sense of filmstock and screens and projectors 

and bulbs. But movies can also be projections of 

ourselves — a momentary snapshot of the internal, 

the introspective, the metaphysical. Given the 

circumstances, we as the film beat are seeing less 

literal projections in movie theaters and doing 

more projecting ourselves. So what are we thinking 

about? Among them are “Wicked,” Dcoms (Disney 

comedies, for uncultured readers) and of course, 

apocalyptic cinema. This series will traverse the 

cinematic doomsday in its eclectic iterations. After 

all, why grapple with an uncomfortable reality 

when you can watch movies that hyperbolize it 

completely? 

— Anish Tamhaney, Daily Film Editor

I don’t like apocalypse movies, or zombie 

movies, or any horror movies really. I’ve never 

gotten much joy out of the suspense before a 

grisly murder or the stress of watching the world 

end. Yet, for some odd reason, I really like “Shaun 

of the Dead.” Edgar Wright (“Baby Driver”) 

and Simon Pegg’s (“Star Trek Beyond”) zombie 

apocalypse movie is filled with stress and gore, 

but is also laced with humor and emotion that 

feels very true to life. In the time of coronavirus, 

it’s fascinating to see how a manufactured and 

somewhat comedic apocalypse can parallel a real 

one.

The titular Shaun (Pegg) is a loser, a creature 

of habit who doesn’t fully put in effort for his 

loved ones. His contentious relationship with his 

stepdad Philip (Bill Nighy, “Love Actually”) has 

caused rifts between him and his mother Barbara 

(Penelope Wilton, “Downton Abbey”). His 

flatmate Peter (Peter Serafinowicz, “The Tick”) 

is sick of Shaun’s excuses for his sloppy friend 

and roommate Ed (Nick Frost, “Hot Fuzz”). His 

girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield, “This Little Life”) 

is tired of his empty promises and his inability 

to put effort into their relationship. Liz’s friends 

Dianne (Lucy Davis, “The Chilling Adventures 

of Sabrina”) and David (Dylan Moran, “Black 

Books”) don’t know how to feel about Shaun and 

watch uncomfortably as his and Liz’s relationship 

splinters. This all changes, though, when he is 

thrust into the zombie apocalypse, pushed outside 

of his sphere of safe comfort and forced to fight.

The onset of the apocalypse is subtle: a woman 

falling at a bus station, clips on the news, tanks 

rolling past the electronics store where Shaun 

works and the chronic sound of sirens in the 

background. It’s so subtle that Shaun and Ed don’t 

even seem to notice, still ignoring the signs of 

apocalypse even as the audience knows exactly 

what’s going on. On the street, Shaun and Ed 

comment lightheartedly on a pair of people who 

appear to be making out, but the man’s head falls 

off as soon as they turn their back. Shaun walks 

bleary-eyed past bloody handprints and dead 

bodies, oblivious to the clear explanations of 

what’s happening on the news. Ed starts taking 

pictures of what he thinks is Shaun fending 

off a romantic advance from what is clearly a 

zombie. All of the puzzle pieces are there, so it’s 

maddening to the audience to watch them take so 

long to understand the kind of danger they’re in.

By the time they figure out what’s going 

on, they’re immediately propelled into action. 

Watching Shaun thrust into a survival situation 

is fascinating. The change between his boring 

(albeit safe) life one day to the zombie apocalypse 

the next is staggering — though he looks like 

the classic pasty-faced loser protagonist, he’s 

surprisingly good at taking down zombies with a 

cricket bat. A team is quickly formed in the throes 

of survival, an odd collection that includes Shaun, 

Ed, Liz, Barbara, Dianne and David, forced 

together in a time of trial.

As we’ve seen in the crisis today, the apocalypse 

brings out the best and the worst in us. In “Shaun 

of the Dead,” Shaun’s best is drawn into focus, 

as he becomes level-headed and confident in his 

decisions, as well as being a pretty good fighter. 

However, it brings out the worst in David, who is 

so worked up about his negative feelings toward 

Shaun that he starts working against the group. 

With coronavirus, we see this same dichotomy, 

seeing the best in the healthcare workers who 

work tirelessly to take care of patients, and the 

worst in the people ignoring CDC guidelines to 

party or the people stocking up on essentials to 

sell them for profit. The fight-or-flight response 

becomes commonplace during a crisis, and the 

characters in “Shaun” have to decide between 

helping others and saving themselves on multiple 

occasions.

“Shaun of the Dead” is the first film in the 

“Three Flavours Cornetto” trilogy by Wright and 

Pegg, consisting of “Shaun,” “Hot Fuzz” and “The 

World’s End” (an alien apocalypse movie), and 

is consistent with the quirky, fast-paced humor 

that the writing duo is associated with. It’s, for 

lack of a better term, very British, with quick 

cuts, quick humor and an exorbitant amount of 

cussing. The threat of zombies is ever-present, 

but so is the humor, and sometimes they coincide: 

A particularly comical scene occurs when Shaun, 

Ed and Liz fight a zombie while accompanied by 

Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now,” hitting the zombie 

with pool cues in time to the music while Dianne 

and Barbara watch and bob their heads to the 

song. Throughout the movie, bickering between 

characters over personal struggles that seem 

insignificant in the face of the crisis is ridiculous, 

but also deeply human.

The parallels between the apocalypse in 

“Shaun of the Dead” and that of our current age 

are staggering, so much so that Pegg and Frost 

made a parody PSA of one of the scenes (and a 

sly apology for a joke that didn’t age as well). The 

slow realization of danger and the quick spread 

are similar, as well as the advice given by the 

authorities to isolate anyone who’s been bitten 

and to avoid physical contact, even with loved 

ones. The core characters’ main goals are to get 

somewhere safe where they can hole out until the 

apocalypse ends. Sound familiar? This is how it 

feels these days, like we’re all just sitting around 

waiting for something to happen, with no idea 

when this will be over. Watching the characters in 

“Shaun of the Dead” holing up in a bar and talking 

about nothing while everything rages outside 

feels right.

On paper, “Shaun of the Dead” is a zombie 

movie, but in reality it is more than that. If you 

can get past the gore, you arrive at a movie about 

love and self-sacrifice, about weathering through 

the end of the world with the people you love. 

One of the wildest parts of the movie comes at 

the end, when a news montage explains what 

has happened one year after the apocalypse with 

the title of “Remembering Z-Day.” Everything 

seems to have gone essentially back to normal. 

This part was craziest to me because it was a wild 

reminder that, as hard as it may be to believe, this 

will all be over too. One day, we’ll look back on this 

crisis as a horrible period of time that happened 

but, thankfully, passed. There will probably be 

a catchy nickname that lasts for decades, and 

one day history books will talk about the global 

pandemic that took thousands of lives. But it will 

pass, eventually, and everything will seem to go 

back to normal, even as the scars of the ordeal 

remain.

Scenes from an Apocalypse: Revisiting ‘Shaun of the Dead’

FILM NOTEBOOK

The social distancing rules put into effect in 

response to the COVID-19 crisis have affected 

everyone greatly, but those who are in creative 

and artistic professions — whose livelihoods 

depend on public engagements — have been 

hit extremely hard by these changes. In the 

University of Michigan community, important 

student 
and 
faculty 
projects 
have 
been 

postponed or canceled altogether, many of which 

were milestones in students’ artistic careers, like 

senior recitals and theses.

School of Music, Theatre & Dance senior 

Ayana Terauchi, a flute performance major 

from Midland, Mich., is one of those artists. 

Terauchi has won top awards in numerous 

national competitions, including second prize 

in the National Flute Association Young Artist 

Competition, first prize in the MTNA Senior 

Woodwind National Competition and first 

prize and award for best performance of a 

newly commissioned work in the National Flute 

Association High School Soloist Competition. 

She has been featured on the NPR radio show 

From the Top during their national tour in 

Kentucky, as well as the prestigious music 

program, YoungArts, held every year in Florida.

Terauchi chose to attend SMTD to study with 

Professor Amy Porter, her flute teacher and 

mentor since high school. 

“There was so much I was able to still learn 

from her, and I admired her so much as a 

musician, being so knowledgeable about not 

only the technical but emotional and general 

life aspects to her teaching,” Terauchi said. 

“Professor Porter really strives to constantly be 

innovative with her pedagogy.” 

Throughout her four years here at SMTD, 

Terauchi has had many memorable performance 

experiences, but one performance stood out the 

most. On Oct. 10, 2019, Terauchi was a featured 

soloist with the University Symphony Orchestra 

at Hill Auditorium, where she played the 

Liebermann “Concerto for Flute and Orchestra, 

Op. 39” as a winner of the 2019 Undergraduate 

Concerto Competition. Performing at Hill 

Auditorium is an honor for any performer, but it’s 

especially notable for students at the University. 

“It was amazing to be able to play as a soloist in 

Hill, knowing all the historical figures who have 

been on that same stage,” Terauchi said.

Terauchi 
not 
only 
reminisced 
on 
the 

performance itself, but also the camaraderie she 

felt from her peers and professors leading up to 

the performance at Hill. 

“I’m really grateful for the support I got from 

everyone throughout the process, like the people 

in my studio class who held mock performances 

and auditions for me and all the support from my 

peers before and after rehearsals,” Terauchi said. 

“It really made me appreciate the people around 

me a lot more than I already did.”

Teruachi was supposed to give her senior 

recital on Mar. 26. Senior recitals culminate the 

past four years of intensive study on students’ 

respective instruments. In SMTD, friends and 

relatives far and wide flock to the Earl V. Moore 

Building to support their beloved graduating 

seniors in concert, from that odd cousin twice 

removed you didn’t really know existed to both 

sets of grandparents. The recitals showcase 

every individual student, and are usually around 

an hour to an hour-and-a-half of formidable 

solo repertoire featuring virtuosic and artistic 

prowess. They are free and open to the public 

with a substantial reception to follow. The senior 

recital is a necessary degree requirement to 

receive a bachelor’s degree in music from any 

institution. However, at SMTD and other leading 

music schools, they have been canceled for safety 

reasons due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

“I had around an hour(’s) worth of music 

prepared that was mostly aligned with what I 

had prepared for graduate school auditions,” 

Terauchi said. “I had repertoire from all different 

eras, like the Bach flute sonata in B minor, the 

Gaubert Fantasy and the Franck violin sonata 

transcribed for flute.” 

Terauchi loves rhythm-heavy romantic music, 

especially by German and Russian composers. 

However, she decided to program music from a 

range of musical styles and eras that have been 

pedagogically important to her playing. 

“There are some pieces that are just so famous 

that you have to play them, like the Franck 

sonata, that are really challenging to learn, but 

fulfilling once you can finally play it. Once you 

learn to really play something, you learn to love 

it,” Terauchi said.

That process of really being able to play any 

piece is tough, according to Terauchi. 

“Playing solo concerts is difficult because you 

have to work on so many pieces, you can’t hide 

behind a big ensemble or other musicians in a 

group, and they require so much stamina. It’s 

so emotionally charged because you’re there to 

show off what you’ve accomplished over four 

years in front of all your peers and colleagues,” 

Terauchi said.

Terauchi’s method of preparation is exemplary 

in its attention to detail and artistry. 

“A few days before the performance, I lock 

myself in my room for a couple of days to really 

dive into the music and be completely immersed 

in it,” Terauchi said. “What that looks like, for 

me, is not only studying my own music to bring 

out the best interpretations, but also listening to 

many other pieces by the composers whose work 

I’m playing to get an even deeper understanding 

of the composers’ style and intentions. There’s a 

lot of important practice that can be done without 

actually playing your instrument.”

The music of Rory Ferreira has seen quite the 

evolution since his debut mixtape in 2012. Under 

the moniker milo, he’s transitioned from a style of 

hip-hop tinged with nerdiness to now embracing 

art and jazz rap.

His side project Scallops Hotel was created 

to develop his more abstruse side, lyrically and 

in terms of production. He has made the leap 

from independent artist to founder of his own 

record label. Throughout his increasing success, 

he’s never sold out. In truth, it doesn’t even seem 

possible for him to sell out, for Rory has so firmly 

ingrained himself in his own niche. It hasn’t failed 

him yet. Recently, he’s given up the milo name 

and replaced it with R.A.P. Ferreira (literally 

Rory Allen Phillip Ferreira). Now he’s released his 

second album under this name, Purple Moonlight 

Pages, which only further solidifies his presence 

in the underground rap scene.

The album is profoundly mature, even for 

Rory’s standards. At his most nerdy, he always 

used immaturity as a tool. Now, his insertion 

of obscure references doesn’t oversaturate the 

project. The last few albums have seen him 

approach rap from a more philosophical and 

poetic angle, but Pages feels different. Whereas 

before, it seemed as though Ferreira was forcing 

himself to come to profound conclusions, this 

album lets the epiphanies arise through his 

experiences. This is apparent in how the songs 

are structured in relation to each other. The 

album doesn’t have any real overlying narrative 

to it. Each song is its own collection of ideas that 

comes and goes for the next collection of ideas to 

appear.

But make no mistake: The album is very 

cohesive. It’s akin to that one junk drawer we all 

have in the kitchen, where all the items have their 

own story, and the drawer itself is representative 

of these stories. A prime example of this is the 

track “LAUNDRY,” whose entire runtime is 

devoted to the process of doing laundry. As a 

result, he expresses his life at home. We get an 

understanding of the relationship he has with 

his family and how it affects his outlook. The 

song has a domestic charm. It stands alone, but 

it makes hearing the next story all the more 

enjoyable.

The cohesion of Purple Moonlight Pages is also 

largely thanks to the production of the Jefferson 

Park Boys, whose members include Carmack, 

Mike Parvizi and Kenny Segal. Their brilliant 

mix of esoteric and organic beats functions 

perfectly alongside Ferreira’s poetry. Often, it 

feels like being inside a hazy jazz club. There’s 

a diverse set of sounds being explored on the 

project: A song like “DUST UP” that could easily 

be an ambient track without the presence of Rory 

is paired close to the latin guitar-flavored beats on 

“ABSOLUTES.” Then there’s “U.D.I.G (UNITED 

DEFENDS 
OF 
INTERNATIONAL 
GOOD 

WILL),” a banger that has a Laurel Canyon sound 

but with twice as much acid involved. Nothing 

is off the table for them, which lends a sense of 

momentum.

If there is one thing Rory seems to be promoting 

on Purple Moonlight Pages, it’s his idea of what 

art should be. No better is this expressed than 

on the track “CYCLES,” where he talks about 

the difference between the underground and 

the mainstream, highlighting their respective 

priorities and how, at times, it feels like an uphill 

battle financially and in gaining the same amount 

of respect. With any other artist this would come 

across as bitter, but with Rory it’s sincere, as he 

says: “Swear I just know my worth, swear I just 

know my worth.” If anything, Rory seems happy 

with where he’s at. Sure, being underground 

versus mainstream means he has to fight a 

little more to keep going, but he’s also working 

to understand himself and the world more. 

The image of the struggling artist has become 

sensationalized at this point. Rory even admits 

to being a part of this trend. As he’s matured, he’s 

come to understand that struggling for the sake of 

struggling doesn’t produce better art. To him, art 

is about gaining knowledge. “No starvin’ artists, 

just artists starvin’ to know.”

R.A.P. Ferreira returns: this time more mature, meditative

ALBUM REVIEW

Some Internet users claim “The Simpsons” 

predicted the coronavirus pandemic in two 

episodes: a 1993 episode titled “Marge in Chains” 

and a 1999 episode titled “Wild Barts Can’t Be 

Broken.” 

In “Marge in Chains,” a disease called the 

Osaka 
Flu, 
featuring 
two 
stereotypically-

portrayed and sick Japanese workers, creates a 

chaotic domino-effect scenario that affects the 

Simpson household and Springfield at large. In 

“Wild Barts Can’t Be Broken,” Homer’s acts of 

vandalism cause Police Chief Wiggum to institute 

a nightly curfew for anyone under the age of 

seventy. 

In response to these 

claims, Bill Oakley, one of 

the writers of “Marge in 

Chains,” spoke out against 

the 
misappropriation 

of these episodes, citing 

that these episodes were 

meant to be innocuous 

and those utilizing the 

episodes 
for 
nefarious 

purposes are “gross.”

Perhaps 
the 
more 

important 
foretelling 

taking place in these 

episodes, however, is the 

ongoing 
normalization 

of racism that is targeted 

towards 
Asians 
and 

Asian Americans. This 

normalization, in turn, 

skews overarching public 

perceptions towards Asian immigrants and Asian 

Americans.

It’s hard to denigrate “Marge in Chains” when 

you compare the episode to other contemporary, 

more visible instances of racism against PoC 

communities. “All American Girl,” which aired in 

1994, was guilty of demanding Korean-American 

actress Margaret Cho to “act more Asian,” while 

also hiring an “expert” to help her act in that 

caricature. As early as 1986, when “The Simpsons” 

was still a short on “The Tracey Ullman Show,” 

the show introduced Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, 

a caricature based on another racist caricature 

portrayed by Peter Sellers in the ’60s and 

one of the only few South Asian character 

representations in its time period. As recently 

as 2016, Chris Rock hired East Asian children 

to 
portray 
prevalent 
East-Asian-American 

stereotypes for the Academy Awards. The gag of 

sick Japanese workers in “Marge in Chains” may 

seem innocent in comparison, though the comedic 

portrayal of East Asian workers as hardworking 

but unhygienic individuals provides a context 

of othering for 

those living in 

a 
Westernized 

society such as 

the United States. 

Through 
the 

span of multiple 

generations, 

comedic 

television 

portrays 
non-

white characters 

and actors, and 

people of color 

by extension, as 

different 
from 

their 
white 

counterparts 
— 

they, 
including 

those of Asian 

descent, 
are 

considered 
the 

other and the foreign even if these portrayals and 

stereotypes may seem benign.

But suppose you take the intentions of these 

problematic portrayals, including those in 

“Marge in Chains,” as innocuous. “The Osaka 

Flu,” inspired by the Hong Kong Flu of 1968, 

was portrayed outlandishly by the writers as 

an attempt to create an innocuous comedic plot 

device. The fact remains that there are current 

coronavirus conspiracy theories that originated 

from a supposed innocent joke about sick East 

Asians and an East Asian disease. In other words, 

there 
are 
those 

within 
anglophone 

countries who are 

eager to create racist 

fear-mongering in the 

midst of a pandemic 

by 
appropriating 

seemingly 
innocent 

comedic 
content. 

This 
content 
goes 

viral and is widely 

shared 
on 
social 

media 
platforms. 

Xenophobic content 

is being consumed 

by many others as 

a 
result, 
whether 

voluntarily or involuntarily.

East and Southeast Asian Americans have 

long experienced verbal and physical assaults as 

a result of xenophobia, a trend that has only been 

exacerbated through the coronavirus pandemic. 

Such racist attacks and xenophobic actions by 

both the public and the government are not new 

either: The 2009 swine flu outbreak saw a spike 

in discrimination towards Latinx Americans, 

the 2003 SARS outbreak unleashed a wave of 

bigotry towards Asian 

Americans and the 

1892 typhus outbreak 

and cholera epidemics 

saw a governmental 

quarantine 
and 

public 
prejudice 

directed 
towards 

Eastern 
European 

Jewish 
immigrants. 

Outbreaks 
of 

disease 
within 

the 
United 
States 

have 
historically 

seen the American 

public attempt to tie 

disease 
outbreaks 

and pandemics to often marginalized groups in 

society.

“The Simpsons,” more than it predicts 

the future, suggests the long history of racist 

narratives, both on and off the screen.

I

t was a Saturday afternoon. My family had been 
playing mahjong — a complex game in which players 
form sets of matching tiles — for an hour or two and 

we’d just finished a round. We shuffled the tiles for the next 
round, shifting the pink and white pieces around the length 
of the table for a few minutes. I wasn’t really good at the 
game: My brother and I had just recently been introduced to 
all the rules. My hands were still getting used to the feel of 
the tiles’ plastic, smooth against my fingers. As I stacked my 
row of tiles, the blank pink sides facing up, my mom spoke.

“You can pass this on to your children,” she said. 
As I’ve grown older, I’ve thought and worried more about 

the idea of passing on something — like clothes, old dolls, 
recipes — to my own kids in the future. The actual question 
of having kids isn’t necessarily a subject of concern for me 
right now. But, if I were to have kids, I’ve always been afraid 
that I wouldn’t be able to pass an incredibly important aspect 
of culture: language. 

My parents immigrated from the Philippines in the ‘90s. I 

was born in Chicago, which makes me a second-generation 
immigrant. I was raised speaking Cebuano (colloquially 
known as Bisaya), an official language of the Philippines 
that is closely related to Tagalog and mainly spoken in the 
country’s southern regions. We ate traditional Filipino food 
like adobo and lechón, practiced various holiday traditions 
like receiving ang pao — red envelopes — and occasionally 
attended Filipino parties where karaoke was the main event. 
But the presence of Filipino culture overall was lacking. 
Growing up in various states across the American Midwest, 
it wasn’t often that I found Filipino culture in places outside 
our home, save for the occasional trips to Asian grocery 
stores and the few times that I heard snippets of Cebuano 
when we’d go on vacation to New York City or visit our old 
friends in Chicago. Most of my extended family lived in the 
Philippines and those who lived in the United States were 
living in California, Washington or Texas, so any exposure 
to Filipino culture was limited to the confines of my house.

When I was still very young, my parents spoke to me in 

both English and Cebuano, aiming to raise me to be bilingual. 
As young children usually do, I learned quickly, but there 
was a problem: Cebuano and English mixed together in my 
brain and sometimes I couldn’t tell the difference between 
the two. In preschool, I tried to explain to my teachers that 
my favorite food was pancit — noodles — but 3-year-old 
me didn’t know how to convey that. In another instance, I 
babbled to my babysitter about being sick and throwing up. 
She didn’t understand me, because I kept using the word suka 
— to vomit. I didn’t realize there was an English equivalent. 

After my teachers sat down with me and my parents to 

talk about my tendency to slip from language to language, 
my parents eventually started to use more English around 
me instead of Cebuano. I stopped mixing Cebuano words 
in my sentences. With no other Filipino children like myself 
at school, I hardly spoke the language at all. This isn’t a 
particularly unique situation. Many second-generation 
immigrants lose their ancestral language at some point. 

In fact, according to a study conducted by the Pew 
Research Center, while nine out of 10 second-
generation immigrants are proficient in English, only 
four out of 10 second-generation Asian Americans 
say that they can speak their parents’ native language 
decently.

I didn’t lose my grasp of the language entirely, I just 

kept listening but stopped speaking. I still know the 
words, and can fully understand spoken Cebuano, but 
I can’t speak it. While I can comprehend my mother’s 
instructions for help around the house or my dad’s 
sarcastic commentary on movies, the glottal stops of 
words like tuo feel strange in my mouth and my tongue 
stumbles over the language’s ng sounds. 

I’m stuck, in a way, between being monolingual 

and bilingual. Any conversation with Cebuano that I 
hold now is stilted by the fact that I know what’s being 
said, but I can only respond in English. As I’ve grown 
older, I’ve found myself becoming more aware of how 
this holds me back, especially when I interact with my 
grandmother, whose knowledge of English is present 
but minimal. When I’m with her, there are often so 
many things I want to say, like how my day’s been, or 
that I’ve been working on a cool project at school. But 
there’s no easy way for me to get any of it across to her. 

Due to my lack of fluency in Cebuano, I know I wouldn’t 

be able to pass on my knowledge of the language in the way 
that my parents could, especially with the likelihood of me 
continuing to live in the U.S. or some other English-speaking 
country. I’ve felt guilty about this for some time. Language 
has such an intimate connection to culture and Cebuano 
was one of the few things keeping me close to my Filipino 
roots. While my family still had Filipino-style meals and 
occasionally attended festivals hosted by Filipino-American 
organizations, I felt that language was something indicative 
of true connection to a culture. In some ways, I saw it as a 
tether. 

At the same time, I’ve always questioned how strong of a 

tether I actually have if I can’t even fully speak my parents’ 
language. When I visit my cousins in the Philippines, I can’t 
help but feel a disconnect between us. At times, when we sit 
together for dinner, someone will say something that I don’t 
particularly understand and the others will laugh while I just 
listen, smiling as if I know what they’re talking about. They 
know both Cebuano and English and often slip between the 
two when they speak to me, but there are certain things — 
like jokes, references — that I can’t fully comprehend because 
I’m not a native speaker. 

This inherent difference, of course, has never been 

something that anyone could change; it’s simply a result 
of the way things are — my parents decided to move to 
the U.S. while my aunts and uncles chose to remain in the 
Philippines. Regardless, it still makes me feel inadequate at 
times, like I’m not as “Filipino” as my cousins are. In a way, I 
suppose I’m not. I was raised an ocean away. Even still, I feel 
pride in being Filipino as much as I am American.

At times, though, I find myself struggling to fit myself 

into either category. Would the generation after me feel even 
more separated from Filipino culture? Would my parents feel 
disappointed in their daughter for not sharing their culture 
enough? It’s not necessarily out of the question for them to 
teach my future kids, but I’ve always seen that scenario as 
me admitting defeat. 

That Saturday afternoon, when my mom told me that I 

could pass on mahjong to my children, it almost felt like a 
form of reassurance. It was as if she knew that I’ve felt guilty 
about my lack of skills in Cebuano. 

As I sat there, I realized she was right — there was an 

entirely different facet of culture that I hadn’t considered. 
I’d been placing too much emphasis on language, when 
elements like Filipino delicacies, ang pao and even karaoke 
are just as important, if not more so. Even though language is 
definitely a large part of culture, it doesn’t encompass all of it. 
Certainly mahjong, a game that I’ve seen Filipino adults play 
at family gatherings and parties, could be considered a part 
of our culture. Perhaps culture doesn’t really have a hard 
definition, and there is no “checklist” of things that you have 
to be or have. Ultimately, feeling connected and legitimized 
in a culture is up to you. 

I know that it’s impossible for me to give the next generation 

in my family the same experience that my parents gave me. 
I won’t be able to give them the language, and I might not 
know or even understand all of the Filipino customs. But I 
can share with them my own experiences and what I have 
learned. While I might not be able to teach them Cebuano 
jokes or show them how to make pancit, I can always pull out 
the old mahjong board with its pink tiles.

W

hen my grandpa passed away 
over two months ago, one of 
my friends asked if we were 

close. I remember responding, “You know 
in school when you’re asked to write about 
a person who inspires you? He has always 
been that person for me.”

Throughout my life, my grandpa, Charles 

VanHampler, inspired me in many ways. In 
the way he patiently raised five daughters 
in a two bedroom and one bathroom home. 
In the way he loved my grandma, bringing 
her flowers and holding her hand through 
the hardships of her dementia. In the way 
he’d sit in the bleachers for each one of my 
brother’s hockey games, standing close up 
against the glass to get the best view.

Grandpa was a carpenter for over 45 

years. I do not know many details about 
the specific work he did except that he 
helped build the middle school I attended, 
even losing his wedding ring during the 
construction. Every time I would walk in 
a certain hall of the school, I would point 
to the ground and tell my friends, “My 
grandpa’s wedding ring is somewhere 
under these tiles!” Grandpa has always 
been drawn to fixing and building 
things, especially in creative ways. I was 
fortunate enough to grow up learning and 
participating in his creative processes.

At a young age, I spent most of my days 

at my grandparents’ house, which was 
thankfully a few blocks away from where 
I live. As a little 3-year-old who barely 
knew how to count, I would dial my 
grandparents’ number on my house phone, 
saying “Papa, come pick me up,” and his car 
would pull into my driveway five minutes 
later. 

The time I spent with my grandpa was 

not ordinary: Our go-to activity wasn’t 
going on walks or playing with toys. 
Instead, Grandpa always envisioned a 
project for us to do, some artistic vision 
that we would work to bring to life over 
the course of the day I spent there, or even 
lasting weeks. These projects depended on 
how old I was at the time, but all consisted 
of innovative ideas, a large set of tools and 
would end with us celebrating with a trip 
to get ice cream.

Our projects started quite simple, like 

when we painted trees on a canvas and then 
glued whole walnuts on the branches to 
make a walnut tree. In the winter, we used 
snow to build Barney and poured cranberry 
juice all over our sculpture to produce 
Barney’s purple hue. We constructed 
homemade puzzles, too — I would trace 
a drawing onto wooden tablets, paint over 
it, and then my grandpa would carve the 
wood into little puzzle pieces. 

As I got older, the projects became 

more complex and were constructed on 
larger mediums. After my grandparents 
got a new TV, we used its box, which had 
been laying around idle, to construct a 
3-foot cardboard cruise ship, which we 

called “the Queen Elizabeth.” We glued on 
details like windows to the shift and small 
dinghies hanging off the side, making the 
ship a perfect place to play with my Polly 
Pocket dolls.

With each project, I was in awe of how 

we could create something special together 
with just the tools and objects sitting 
around in Grandpa’s house. I was proud of 
how meticulous we were in making sure 
our projects turned out precisely as we 
wished. Even though I was young, Grandpa 
let me work on much of the construction, 
trusting me to carefully carve with an 
Exacto knife or diligently spread Gorilla 
Glue on a surface, thus giving me hands-on 
experience with building and designing. 

However, as I got older and busier 

with school, I spent less time at my 
grandparents’ house. Our projects became 
less frequent and more oriented around 
school assignments I occasionally needed 
help with. A fifth-grade project requiring 
a presentation on tectonic plates led us to 
continue our favorite activity of making 
puzzles, but this time the puzzle was made 
up of plate boundaries. My favorite was 
an elementary school science assignment 
where I had to create a circuit that lit up a 
lighthouse. With Grandpa’s help, I was able 
to set up the web cables and circuit board 

quickly. But we always had to go above 
and beyond, so we spent the next few days 
perfecting a paper mache mountain that 
the lighthouse was built upon. 

During my childhood, I thought the 

activities Grandpa and I did during the day 
were common between granddaughters 
and grandpas. I just assumed that my 
friends were doing the same thing 
during their summer break — at their 
grandparent’s house sawing pieces of wood 
and drinking Boston Coolers on a swing 
they constructed just a few hours before. 
As I got older and noticed our relationship 
was unique, I realized how special it was 
for him to share his passion for design 
and construction with me. It is even 
more special for me to have gained that 
same passion as I watched him work. We 
were two minds with different ages and 
perspectives, but were able to envision and 
accomplish such innovative projects. 

At the time, each project felt like fun, 

not work. Yet each day, my skills were 
evolving, and as I watched my grandpa lead 
us through each creation, my imagination 
was growing. I mimicked his meticulous 
craft, not moving on to the next step of 
a project until we mixed the perfect sky 
blue shade of paint or until a shape of wood 
was completely sanded evenly. I learned 

that hardwood stores are not a necessity 
because any spare pipe, string, or slab 
of wood lying around Grandpa’s garage 
always became an essential part of the 
project. I reflected on Grandpa’s drive as 
he tinkered and toyed with the positioning 
of materials until they fit as perfectly as he 
envisioned them.

For most of my life, I thought of myself 

as analytical: I love numbers and was 
planning to study an analytical subject in 
college. Yet, my creative, artistic side had 
been brewing within me since the time 
spent in my grandparent’s basement. It 
first made its appearance when I started 
working with graphic design in high school 
as a designer for my high school newspaper. 
It continued growing when I got to college 
and continued with newspaper design at 
The Michigan Daily and graphic making 
for an application being built in BlueLab. 
It finally established itself as part of me 
with my recent acceptance to the School of 
Information.

Now, I plan to carry out my dream job as 

a user experience (UX) designer, working 
with the branding, design, usability and 
function of a product. More specifically, 
I want to work with the redesigning 
of websites and apps. This “designer” 
identity I so often felt with my Grandpa is 
now becoming a truly important part of 
my identity and career. I wish I could tell 
my grandpa, because I know how proud 
he would be. I also believe he would feel 
gratified to know that all the time and 
energy he focused on me throughout the 
years has impacted my life goals. 

As I carry out my future experimenting 

with 
the 
usability, 
usefulness 
and 

desirability provided in the interaction 
with a product, I plan to approach these 
situations the same as I did when we 
drizzled our snowman in cranberry juice, 
built puzzles and crafted ships. Though my 
imagination is not as vivid as it was when 
I was seven, I plan to channel the work 
ethic, attention to detail and innovative 
values that I learned with Grandpa.

Saying goodbye to someone you love is 

never easy. Especially with being away 
at school for the past two years, it made 
me feel like I missed out on more time I 
could have spent with him. Those first 
couple weeks after he passed away I felt 
regret and grief. However, thinking about 
his creative impact on me, especially with 
my admission into School of Information, 
has helped process that grief. Even though 
Grandpa is no longer physically here, I feel 
closer to him now than I have in a while.

T

here is nothing like a good 
romantic comedy to make 
you reevaluate your love 

life. Watching any movie with a boy-
meets-girl plot results in what my 
mother calls an “I’m going to die fat, 
broke and alone” moment, as terrible 
as that sounds. It’s the kind of feeling 
that makes you want any semblance 
of validation immediately, especially 
from a potential romantic partner. 

In one of these moments during 

my freshman year of college, to the 
rolling credit music of “27 Dresses,” I 
downloaded Tinder. I imagine I’m not 
the only one of the dating app’s millions 
of active users who decided to take 
the plunge in a flash of self-pity, 
searching for the immediate embrace 
of dopamine from a mutual match, just 
a few leisurely swipes away. 

Soon, the late-night curiosity that 

drew me to temporarily try Tinder 
had transformed into swiping during 
a dull moment during class, browsing 
the app as a distraction from my 
homework, during parties I didn’t 
want to be at and, of course, while on 
the toilet. At first, I didn’t consider my 
fascination with Tinder to be related 
at all to my own actual romantic life. 
I thought of it more as a tool, one for 
a brief burst of dopamine in the form 
of an unexpected match. I looked at 
my participation in the online dating 
scene more as another source of digital 
entertainment and a self-esteem boost, 
rather than a realistic way to find a 
boyfriend.

But a few months later, I was on all 

the apps — Tinder, Bumble (which 
requires women to message first) and 
Hinge (which markets itself as a dating 
app that is “designed to be deleted”). 
Needless to say, none of them are truly 
a foil to the cons of the others. Instead, 
they offer different options to fulfill 
the same perpetual human need: 
the constant search for love, sex and 
everything that falls in between.

Before I came to college, I had a lot of 

knowledge about relationships but not 
much experience, having gone to an 
all-girls Catholic school for my entire 
secondary school education. I was very 
familiar with plaid skirts and where I 
could find discount Oxford shirts in 
the Walmart boys’ section, but had 
only gone on one date in my whole life, 
which went badly not because of my 
own inexperience but rather that of my 
date. I knew about the hookup culture 
on campuses like the University of 

Michigan’s, but assumed I would never 
be confident enough to partake, still 
working through my mix of ignorance 
and anxiety when it came to dating.

There were several contradictions 

mixed into this anxiety, too. I wasn’t 
Catholic and had no qualms about 
premarital sex, but growing up in that 
environment had stuck me in a state of 
arrested development. I knew I wanted 
to date, sure, but I wasn’t sure how to 
navigate that scene in any way, shape 
or form. It wasn’t like I was saving 
myself for Jesus — my parents had 
sent me to a private school that just so 
happened to be Catholic, but that still 
meant a life away from boys. Reading 
Cosmopolitan makes a 17-year-old girl 
feel well-versed in sex by herself, but 
when faced with the real thing, it was 
a different story altogether.

Once at U-M, the sheer number of 

romantic choices I had to make was 
overwhelming, with thousands of 
boys my own age swarming around 
me at parties, on the Diag, everywhere 
I went. People constantly talked 
about sex, about hooking up, about 
sloppy blacked-out flings and the 
excitement of meeting new people 
around every corner. For someone 
who hadn’t even had her first kiss 
yet, I was simultaneously exhilarated 
and terrified. I wasn’t the only one 
many other people I knew were having 
their first truly mature romantic 
experiences on dating apps, something 
that seemed to be the norm for my 
generation of young adults. 

The allure of these apps comes with 

how easy they make dating. With just 
their phone, a person is immediately 
able to access hundreds of people 
online that they might have never 
met in person, especially on a college 
campus. It’s a lot less daunting flipping 
through 
ready-made 
packages 
of 

people than trying to chat up someone 
in a bar. Thus comes the paradox of that 
ease: There are even people scrolling 
on dating apps while physically in a 
bar, so they are a lot more hesitant to 
engage when there are a million more 
options in the palm of their hand. 
When everyone has agreed to a silent 
transaction, even the people who have 
chosen to eschew Tinder for the old 
way are looked at funny when they try 
to chat someone up. It’s a whole new 
world. 

An advantage I saw in dating 

apps was the mutual understanding 
between me and the person I’d be 

messaging: If we were messaging, it 
meant we were attracted to each other, 
that we were both interested. There 
was no confusion in the intentions 
either I or a potential match had on 
the platform; all one had to do was 
look at my bio to see I was looking for a 
relationship. It took some of the terror 
out of the risk of putting yourself out 
there, as I still felt overwhelmed by the 
options and norms of college dating 
life, even after one brief and seemingly 
innocent tryst freshman year that 
didn’t lead anywhere. 

Two years later, I’m in love, actually 

in love for the first time in my entire 
life. It’s making me think a lot about 
why I never really fell before, why I 
ended up in love by surprise and not 
by searching for it. The cliche of never 
finding what you want until you’ve 
given up is true for me, at least. Maybe 
it’s in that choice, in the selectivity and 
apparent promise of these apps, that 
some of us set ourselves up for failure 
and some for success in love. Is there 
a secret recipe? Does the fact that we 
are often starting our adult love lives 
through these apps mean we will 
always approach love with something 
so specific in mind?

Beyond that, I wonder whether the 

paradigms set up by apps like these are 
changing the way we look at romance 
completely. We all select our partners 
judgmentally, 
as 
much 
as 
some 

people claim to transcend prejudices, 
whether it’s in person or on an app. 
It’s a biological imperative, especially 
for those in their reproductive prime: 
pretty, healthy, tall, skinny, strong, 
attractive people are immediately 
more appealing than the rest. But is 
that flurry of preferences somehow 
worsened by the ease of an app 
interface, where one rarely can show 
their personality? Is true love — as 
some people have posited in the wake 
of hookup culture’s moral panic — 
dead? Or has it just turned into a game?

The modern meet-cute looks very 

different than it used to — this time, 
it’s the wonder of getting texted 
consistently that spells love, not 
necessarily a collision walking down 
the sidewalk or hand touch over spilled 
papers. Trying to decode in real time 
whether or not an interaction in person 
is inherently romantic seems harder 
than before; I don’t think I would ever 
go off my instinct alone before asking 
someone out today, if I knew I could 
play it safe and learn more about that 

person’s intentions ahead of making 
my decision by Googling them or even 
taking a glance at their Instagram. 
Imagining the grand gestures of 
yesteryear — the boomboxes outside 
of windows and surprise appearances 
at airport gates — I feel legitimately 
uncomfortable. All I want from 
romance is a nice good-morning text 
and a coffee once in a while, really. 
It’s obvious that our idea of what is 
romantic has changed, but the need 
for romance hasn’t. Instead, it’s just 
gotten more complicated. 

Though 
attachment 
styles 
that 

are formed during childhood largely 
end up making a person more insecure 
or secure in their love lives, the ways 
in which we approach creating those 
attachments is rapidly changing. I 
can see it in the way people talk to 
each other in these coffee shops, on 
the streets, at parties and in my own 
circle of friends. The getting-to-know-
you stage of dating has flipped from 
an incline to a parabola: Before even 
meeting a potential romantic partner 
or hookup, most of us have “talked” 
to them already, stalked their social 
media accounts, asked friends or at 
least Googled them. 

Thus, we go into the first date with 

the information about the person that 
is usually exchanged as you get to 
know someone. After the appropriate 
amount of time has passed to break 
through the wall of self-marketing that 
many of us put up for these apps, then, 
maybe we can get to something deeper 
than purely physical or intellectual 
attraction. 

These 
apps 
become 
addictive 

through an erratic matching system 
that provides hits of the feel-good 
hormone 
dopamine 
in 
knowing 

someone 
finds 
you 
immediately 

attractive. 

The fact that these systems exist 

and are so widespread seems like a 
perfect opportunity for psychological 
research on our generation, dating 
and media. To get a better idea of 
how much the combination of self-
marketing, selection and opportunity 
that dating apps offer is potentially 
changing our perception of love, I 
sought out University professors who 
were asking the same questions as me 
in their research.

But what I found, at least initially, 

was discouraging. People have only 
been using apps like Tinder and 
Bumble — which have been active on 

the App Store since 2012 and 2014, 
respectively — for less than 10 years, 
so 
psychologists 
and 
sociologists 

don’t have much data to work with. 
Moreover, due to the personal nature 
of these apps, they have nearly 
impenetrable data firewalls, to the 
point that most researchers have to 
build a lookalike tester app to use on 
their subjects. 

The lack of long-term data on dating 

apps and human behavior poses a 
unique problem, as we don’t know how 
these apps are affecting the present, 
but also how they will affect the 
romantic lives of users in the future.

However, 
dating 
services 
like 

eHarmony 
and 
Match.com 
have 

been using algorithms and selection 
mechanisms similar to the ones used by 
Tinder and other dating apps for a long 
time, and researchers know much more 
about them, especially because their 
software developers modeled their 
systems off of data from long-lasting 
relationships. When I read the studies 
around these models, one researcher’s 
name kept popping up again and again: 
Dr. Bill Chopik, an assistant professor 
of 
Social/Personality 
Psychology 

at Michigan State University and a 
visiting scholar here are U-M. I was 
happy to find out that he was currently 

working in Ann 
Arbor.

The 
winter 

wind 
biting 

my 
face, 
I 

walked to the 
psychology 
department 
on 
campus 

and found myself pushed into the 
maze that is East Hall. It almost felt 
like I was inside a giant brain. After 
10 minutes of wandering the grey-
carpeted corridors of the department, 
Dr. Chopik came to retrieve me from 
the depths of the hallways. Questions 
were whizzing through my brain 
already. Relieved to finally be walking 
with direction, I followed Chopik to his 
office. “Ready to talk about Tinder?” I 
asked. He nodded, laughing. 

Chopik is no stranger to research on 

what makes love actually tick. He has 
done several studies on how couples 

who have been together for decades 
have lasted throughout the many 
changes in life, trying to crack open 
the secrets to a good relationship by 
working backwards. 

“I 
tell 
people 
I 
study 
how 

relationships and the people in them 
change over time,” he explained. 
“Basically, I’m most interested in what 
makes people happy and healthy.” He 
settled in his seat, the snow falling 
leisurely outside the office window. 

Chopik has been interviewed many 

times before on this same topic, as 
people grapple to find meaning in this 
new age of dating. No one really knows 
how a technology will eventually 

affect the way we approach and act in 
relationships, and that’s scary.

But that change, Chopik said, might 

not necessarily be a bad thing. 

“So there’s a bunch of people who 

will look at college students today. 
And they have this moral panic about 
how they’re on their phones. They’re 
zombies. They’re out of touch,” Chopik 
laughed. “You know, totally unengaged 
with the world. And I don’t think that’s 
entirely accurate. I think young people 
are engaged in all sorts of things. 
And they’re reflecting on the role of 
technology and relationships. And so 
the same question you just had, I’m 
sure a lot of your friends think about 
too.” 

Indeed, when I told my roommates I 

was planning on writing about Tinder, 
they all told me the same thing: We’re 
all interested to see how this affects us 
in the long run.

“I will also say that a lot of people 

have that mentality (of going into 
relationships casually) when they’re 
young; people maybe 20 years ago also 
had that mentality. A lot of college 
students think that way and they’re at 
an exciting time in life, or they might 
not be sure where they’re going to be in 
two years,” Chopik explained. 

Listening to him talk, I was reminded 

of stories my parents had told me about 
their various partners throughout 
college. Though they hadn’t met their 
lovers online, they had still had the 
youthful impulse to make spur-of-
the-moment romantic decisions, to 
meet new people, to explore. It wasn’t 
as streamlined as with an app, but it 
still existed. Putting a young person 
in a vacuum doesn’t take away the fact 
that they’re young in the first place, Dr. 
Chopik argued. 

I’ve made some of my best friends 

through technology, keep up with 
ones who’ve moved away via social 
media and despite the stigma of it all, 
dating apps did, in a way, make me 
feel better about myself. Though I was 
never successful in finding a long-term 
partner through Tinder, matching and 
chatting with people on apps offered a 
boost in my self-esteem and a path to 
practice romantic interaction when I 
was barely competent at the beginning 
of college. 

I believe that the changes in how we 

form attachments based on technology 
would have happened anyway, even 
without dating apps. Even standard 
social media can serve as a dating app 
these days, with Tinder and Bumble 
giving the option to integrate your 
other social media accounts into your 
profile. As long as there is an option 
to connect with other people, through 
direct messages, comments and likes, 
people will find a way to make those 
connections romantically or sexually 

suggestive, if not direct.

In Chopik’s words, “technology 

often mimics society, not necessarily 
the other way around.” 
W

hen I first thought about 
writing on the realities 
of dating apps in the 

love lives of young people, specifically 
about how much of a game dating 
has become, I immediately thought 
of an article in Vanity Fair, where 
reporter Nancy Jo Sales scoured a 
Manhattan bar and a few college 
campuses for the first signs of change 
in the dating scene due to the rise 
in apps like Tinder. I remembered 
reading articles on dating apps like 
hers, feeling like they were windows 
into another world, one where I wasn’t 
stuck in my polyester plaid with 30 
other girls in a chapel five times a 
week. 

Rereading the article now, on sad, 

printed-out computer paper, I still 
find myself gasping at most of what 
her interviewees said about their 
respective love lives and the ways that 
apps like Tinder had both helped and 
hurt them. To put it in the words of one 
of the interviewed women, the piece 
would make any reader think that our 
era could easily be christened as the 
“Dating Apocalypse.” 

Or, to put it in the words of one of the 

interviewed males, a young musician: 
“‘I would just be sitting at home and 
playing guitar, now it’s ba-ding’ — he 
makes the chirpy alert sound of a 
Tinder match — ‘and …’ He pauses, as 
if disgusted. ‘… I’m fucking.’”

In the years since that piece came 

out, Sales has been hard at work 
cracking open quotes like these, trying 
to get inside the minds of those behind 
the new age of dating. All of this 
went into a particularly interesting 
HBO documentary last year, cleverly 
entitled “Swiped: Hooking Up in the 
Digital Age.” While watching the 
documentary, I was slack-jawed in the 
same way that the article had made 
me, simultaneously in awe of not only 
how the apps were used, but how they 
were designed. 

In 
a 
podcast 
interview 
with 

Vox, Sales discussed the careful 
construction of the apps, how they 
suck us in and whXat this means for 
us.

“You swipe, you might get a match, 

you might not. And then you’re just, 
like, excited to play the game,” Sales 
said. “We’ve become products ... 
We are providing valuable data on a 
pretty consistent basis to people who 
are making money off of us. We’re 
laborers, in a sense, to people who 
don’t really care whether or not we fall 
in love or get married or whatever.”

As I closed the podcast on my 

computer, Sales’ words still echoing in 

my skull, I whipped out my phone and 
re-downloaded the Tinder app, just to 
see my old profile. My bio welcomed me 
like an old friend: There were the same 
photos I had remembered, the same 
links to my Spotify and Instagram, the 
same coy caption: If you can name all 
5 members of Fleetwood Mac, you’re 
in the right place. Writer, musician, 
addicted to VICE documentaries on 
YouTube. I physically cringed at that 
last line. The same photo that’s my 
profile picture on all my social media 
stared me in the face, and I swiped 
through the rest of the photos, slightly 
proud of the seeming perfection of 
the bio. I used to call this profile my 
“masterpiece,” and for good reason. 
Even if it never got me a boyfriend, it 
definitely hit the spot to get me some 
attention.

Still, it felt gross to be back in the 

interface, looking at my old messages 
like an elderly lady reading her diary 
entries from childhood. Even if my 
heart was never really in the bad dates 
I went on, the apps still had their time 
with me and did whatever they were 
going to do to my mindset.

No matter what you do, there is no 

way that the culture around dating 
apps doesn’t touch you. But will the 
supremacy of dating apps last, and 
how will they fare in the long run? 
As Sales said, we’re the guinea pigs 
here. We’re the first generation to do 
romance online, whether it’s through 
apps specifically for dating or not. 

What is that actually doing to the 

way we form relationships? It seems 
like a self-fulfilling prophecy, to some 
extent — what we believe about these 
channels of connection seems to come 
true in our own lives, just because of 
the way we interact with them. But if 
this is true, is there some secret way 
to get what you actually want out of 
them? Or will they stain our romantic 
histories like spilled tea, a momentary 
mistake or attraction that seems to 
influence the rest of our connections? 

I look at my partner sometimes and 

wonder, what if this hadn’t happened? 
What if I didn’t fall in love with you? I 
think that is what makes the long-term 
questions of what these apps mean 
for our generation so hard to answer, 
because the answer is only a collection 
of these questions themselves, a 
collection of instances where we look 
at our lives and think about the choices 
we have made. Falling in love is easy, 
but getting there is hard. Even if it 
seems to be just beyond one swipe.

I 

don’t remember when I fell 
in love with running. I cannot 
remember my first run or my 

first pair of running sneakers. Early 
on, I recall equating running to a 
mundanity, something I did to stay in 
shape and keep active as an incredibly 
uncoordinated individual who failed 
when it came to team sports. As a child, 
I hadn’t discovered the runner’s high 
or that sweaty addiction. But between 
cross country camps and routing solo 
long distance Sunday mornings, running 
turned into a part of my daily life — a part 
of who I am. I went from being a person 
who ran, to a runner. I never had the 
grace or the long legs or the innate talent 
as an athlete, but I had the drive. As I 
recognized the onset of anxiety in my 
early teenage years, I found that running 
quelled my anxiety the way nothing else 
seemed to. 

Though I don’t remember the impetus 

to begin, I do remember my mother 
dropping me off to middle school cross 
country practice in 2008, me with 
unlaced mud-caked sneakers holding 
a water bottle, wet with condensation. 
I remember my first five mile race, 
11 years old, looping the roads of my 
hometown, the longest I felt I’d run in 
my life. I remember the near unending, 
heat soaked runs I took in St. Louis two 
summers ago, the 100 degree sun tanning 
my sunscreened shoulders as my legs 
willed another five, six, seven miles. I 
remember the first time I ran 15 miles, 
with my brother trailing me in a beach 

cruiser bike, down a New Jersey beach 
adjacent sidewalk in August. I remember 
rounding the final corner of the Detroit 
Marathon, a finish line of red and blue 
balloons swaying against a freezing, navy 
October Michigan sky. 

I remember falling deeper down the 

rabbithole of near dependency on such 
meditative movement, when I moved 
to Michigan as a college freshman and 
strained to hang on to some part of home 
within my new routine. Somewhere in 
the midst of paper bibs pinned to pink 
athletic shirts, roads and miles and paths 
and ankle injuries and Gatorade bottles 
and pairs of sneakers, I fell in love. I 
became addicted to the golden flush 
behind my cheeks as I finished a blissful 
jog, runner’s high radiating through me. 
I’m addicted to the sweat, the thrill, the 
motion. I’ll never stop. 
R

unning has always been a 
solace, a safe space where I 
can sort out my thoughts, an 

invisible place that helps me find answers 
to complex questions and scenarios that 
seem murky or impossible to untangle. 
Running has steadied my breath when I 
feel like I can’t inhale; it puts unsettling 
emotions 
at 
ease 
and 
consistently 

reminds me to remain grounded in times 
of tribulation. It’s been a form of moving 
therapy since I can remember, a method of 
calming panic when I’m anxious. There’s 
something about the repetition, resolve 
and regularity that has rendered running 
a constant in my life — an activity to fall 
back on in times of uncertainty. 

It is through running, specifically after 

completing the 2018 Detroit Marathon, 
that I’ve learned to have an unabashed 
appreciation for my body, in the short, 
muscular legs I’ve always detested. 
They’ve carried me, according to the 
Nike+ running application I sometimes 
use to track my outdoor running distance, 
935 miles in the last year. Anytime I feel 
stressed about schoolwork or my future 
or a relationship, I lace up my sneakers 
and I take to the road.

With wind in my face and concrete 

under my feet, I have the ability to choose 
— to turn left or right, to stop and look out 
at a body of water, to focus on everything 
or nothing, to slow down and to speed 
up. If I slink out of my childhood home 
before 8 a.m., as my parents and brothers 
sleep, the roads are quiet, devoid of car 
engines, and the air smells of salt water. 
If I wait until after 4 p.m. to chase 
golden hour, the neighborhood smells 
of dinnertime and the inaugural use of 
barbecue grills. As I traverse familiar 
streets and head toward the beach, I pass 
handfuls of other runners and podcast 

walkers, people with this mutual 
affinity for the road, and we smile at 

one another, lifting a sweat-slicked hand 
in acknowledgement. We connect in the 
way you can with strangers handling a 
circumstance the same way. 
I

t’s no surprise then, with the 
onset of pandemic COVID-19 and 
physical isolation, I found myself 

looking forward to and welcoming 
consistent outdoors runs. When the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
closed 
the 

Central Campus Recreation Building 
and the Intramural Sports Building 
after canceling in-person classes and 
transitioning online for precautionary 
measures, I was forced from my winter 
treadmill routine to the streets of Ann 
Arbor. With the spring weather just 
starting to show, I had no complaints. On 
rainy or colder days, with nothing else to 
do, I waited for the best moment — when 
the sun peeked out or the sky temporarily 
dried up — to leave the house with no 
determined path or plan except to run 
until I couldn’t anymore. 

Many students, trapped in the house 

with roommates or family, feel the same 
tug to running outdoors.

Lana 
Wolf, 
a 
junior 
at 
Cornell 

University and a New Jersey native, has 
picked up running as a part of her daily 
routine since COVID-19 dispeled her 
from her college campus. Never a regular 
runner in the past, Wolf is now running 
near every day and said, “There’s 
something special about running right 
now and being in nature exercising … 
seeing families playing in their yard and 
other people out exercising — I just feel 

like I’m part of a community.” 

I feel similarly in the undefinable 

comfort of distant connection, especially 
in a time where I go hours and even 
days only meeting the eyes of my 
immediate family members. Even when 
the infrastructure of our country shakes 
and crumbles, our overarching sense 
of community remains firm — we’re 
all navigating a disconcerting time in 
our nation’s history, we all need ways 
to cope. Being quarantined with my 
15-year-old cousin, a runner herself, 
has had a tremendous influence on our 
relationship. At least three times a week, 
we run side by side, talking each other 
through our current circumstances. 

The ungovernable and unmanageable 

emotional toll that COVID-19 has taken 
on so many of us leaves us craving some 
way to have a semblance of routine or 
sovereignty over our lives. 

Olivia Kem, a senior at Santa Clara 

University and Phoenix, AZ native, was 
a semi-regular runner before quarantine 
and has found herself much more drawn 
to the activity with the dawn of social 
distancing. She has upped both the 
mileage and frequency of her running 
since the pandemic altered daily life. 

“I realized that a huge reason I enjoy 

running is because it gives me something 
that I can control and improve on. I can 
push myself to go a little farther or a little 
faster everyday and this is something 
no one can take away from me,” she 
said, “This is especially important now 
when it feels like everything in my life is 
controlled by COVID-19. I did not realize 
until now how much I value this control. 
Running has also given me the motivation 
to get out of bed early in the morning to 
beat the Phoenix heat, which has also 
helped me stay sane by providing me 
with a sense of purpose each morning.” 

Since I moved back home to quarantine 

nearly three weeks ago, I’ve noticed a 
large increase in the amount of runners 
in my neighborhood. Running has gone 
from a pastime some people in my town 
enjoyed, to a hobby dozens of people 
have picked up. Workout studios and 
gyms have temporarily closed, leaving 
people without a way to release stress 
through exercise. Largely in part due to 
my own infatuation with running, and 
my giddy desire that everyone find the 
same solace I feel when running, I am 
ecstatic to see people eagerly jumping on 
the runner train, and their newfound — 
or reinvigorated — love for running.

Running through quarantine

BY ELI RALLO, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

ILLUSTRATION BY TAYLOR SCHOTT


O

n March 25, I boarded a flight from Detroit 
to Southern California, where I grew up. The 
airport was eerily empty, the Transportation 

Security Administration workers wore masks and 
televisions throughout the terminal were broadcasting the 
latest fatality numbers of COVID-19. Rolling my suitcase 
to my gate, the few people in the terminal gave each other 
a wide berth, exchanging nervous yet empathetic half-
smiles. This is weird, everyone said wordlessly to each 
other. Things are not as they should be.

I found my seat on the mostly empty plane, leaned 

my head against the freshly disinfected (courtesy of 
my antibacterial wipes) window and queued up Peter, 
Paul and Mary’s “Leaving on a Jet Plane.” Cliche? Most 
definitely. Yet the lyrics, describing leaving behind a lover 
for some future unknown — “I’m leaving, on a jet plane 
/ don’t know when I’ll be back again / Oh babe, I hate to 
go” — hit a little too close to home, and I cried, hard, the 
continuation of the past three days of non-stop tears since 
I’d made the decision it was time for me to leave Ann Arbor. 

As the clouds soared beneath me, I allowed myself to 

fully delve into the melodramatic-film-end-scene mood 
of the moment, indulging in feeling shamelessly sorry for 
myself. This global pandemic has unlocked a whole lot of 
weird, big-picture feelings — a sense of uprootedness, a 
floaty kind of dread, grief on a broad, existential scale — all 
emotions I hadn’t experienced before and didn’t (and still 
don’t) really know how to put into more explicit words. 

In a perhaps futile effort to make sense of it all, though, 

I’ve come to the realization that many of these feelings 
resonate as variations on one, nastily familiar one: 
heartbreak. Leaving Ann Arbor feels, for lack of a better 
comparison, like a breakup — and a pretty shitty one at 
that. 

Everyone has their own tragedies right now, a friend of 

mine aptly put it, whether it be a canceled commencement, 
a postponed performance or a more immediate and life-
threatening threat such as loss of a job, a bad home 
environment that’s impossible to escape or the disease 
itself. In the grand scheme of people who are impacted by 
COVID-19, my exodus from Ann Arbor is not a big deal. I 
know this. Yet, I’m struggling.

I know the virus is all everyone’s writing about right 

now, in a way that can sometimes feel like a desperate race 

to draw the proper conclusions or 
make the most profound creative 
statement about the current state 
of the world. Sloane Crosley of 
The New York Times somewhat 
ironically 
warns 
against 
this 

phenomenon, pointing out that 
“from an artistic standpoint, it’s 
best to let tragedy cool before 
gulping it down and spitting it back 
into everyone’s faces.” 

But while this virus is a big 

collective experience, it’s also 
inherently solitary — as from our 
little self-isolation bubbles we 
attempt to conceptualize where, as 
individuals, we stand with this new 
reality. So this is me attempting not 
to draw any big picture conclusions 
or spit in anyone’s face, but rather 
put 
words 
to 
an 
experience 

that — like any heartbreak — is 
immensely personal. I’m dealing 

with the loss of Ann Arbor in the way that I’ve dealt with 
every previous heartbreak I’ve gone through — writing 
about it, breaking it down, hoping that doing so will help 
make sense of the current moment in some small way. 

Leaving Ann Arbor was a conscious choice on my behalf, 

which is in large part why it was so difficult to go. Students 
were urged to leave campus, but I was living in off-campus 
housing. I had an apartment, I had access to a roommates’ 
car, I had friends living around me I could lean on in case 
of emergency. I could have stayed through the summer 
as I’d previously been planning on. I could have tried to 
prolong my college experience as long as possible, tried to 
take in every last drop of Ann Arbor.

Ann Arbor has been my home for the past four years. I 

have grown into the person I am in this city — in fraternity 
basements and dingy bars, Mason Hall class discussions 
on the modern political system where I can’t help but be 
distracted by the orange-hued leaves of the Diag trees 
outside the window, strategizing meetings with friends 
from various campus orgs over Espresso Royale’s watered-
down Hazelnut blend, late night roommate talks on 
fraying, passed-down couches in run-down college houses 
weakly lit by a bulb the landlord insists is sufficient for the 
space. I’ve met people that inspire me to take action and 
advocate for others, people that taught me to love deeply, 
people I now consider my best friends. 

This year, my senior year, full of evenings gathered 

around the living room TV with roommates to do The 
New York Times crossword puzzle, weekly wine-fueled 
book clubs with friends, and familiar friendly faces in my 
regular coffee shop haunts, Ann Arbor has felt like exactly 
where I needed to be. It’s felt like where I am supposed to 
be — surrounded by a community that knows me well, that 
supports me, that sees me for who I am.

Ann Arbor and I have had a good relationship, a healthy 

one, for the most part. But as in any relationship, things 
change. Ann Arbor has changed — it’s shuttered, quiet, 
isolated. It’s not the same brimming, full of energy city 
that I know and love, with coffee shops overflowing with 
friends, young parents walking their dogs in the Nichols 
Arboretum with offspring in tow, flocks of students toting 
backpacks and bemoaning upcoming midterms crossing 
the Diag on their way to class. The community, the 
collective being, has become a shadow of what it once was, 

reduced to a few solitary joggers and roommates braving 
the outdoors for aimless socially responsible walks. 

Surrounded by the echoes of the past four years of 

my life, it took everything in me not to play dumb, to let 
myself be convinced that this new status quo was anything 
close to what had once been. I wanted, so badly, to believe 
that the community and support I’d felt in this town was 
still there. It would have been easier, perhaps, to stay. To 
prolong the stage of life that was Ann Arbor. But, I quite 
reluctantly forced myself to recognize that staying in Ann 
Arbor was hurting me more than it was helping me — it 
was just a constant reminder of what was and what could 
have been. 

I chose to come home to California. I chose to be with 

my family in a time of widespread uncertainty, to let 
myself have some stability for the moment, to spend time 
in the sunshine, read and wait. Still, though, letting go 
wasn’t — and isn’t — easy.

Having to make the choice to leave, to break-up with 

not only this city, but the person I am there, is terrifying. 
I’ve left before of course, for summers or study abroad, but 
I’ve always come back. Who am I without even the future 
promise of Ann Arbor to remind me? Ann Arbor is where 
I’ve had the space to question who I am as an independent 
human being, to shape an identity free of the constraints 
of my hometown. The person I am in Ann Arbor is self-
assured, knows who and what she values and is confident 
in her role in her friendships and her own ability to take 
on the world. Is that person still there, if Ann Arbor isn’t 
anymore?

This transition was going to come anyways. I wasn’t 

going to stay in college, and in Ann Arbor, forever. But 
the suddenness, the lack of resolution or clarity has made 
the change hit so much harder. I wanted this relationship 
to end with some real closure, where Ann Arbor and I 
could reflect on all the growth and good experiences 
we’d had with our time, celebrating the end of an era 
with graduation caps and champagne. I was planning on 
leaving Ann Arbor with my friends in tow, an entire class 
of college graduates entering the post-graduate world 
with each other to lean on. Instead, we’re all scattered 
back to our parents’ houses, hiding from the shadow of our 
17-year-old selves — prematurely leaving behind the city 
that’s given us so much, the friends we’ve made, the sense 
of self we’ve forged in this place.

Despite how unfair it feels and how badly I wish I could 

get those last two months back, I’m trying to come with 
terms with the fact that it’s time for me to let go. Maybe 
someday Ann Arbor and I can reconcile — but I don’t 
know, and I’m not counting on it. So for now, I’m saying my 
goodbyes, while retaining what I can of the person Ann 
Arbor has taught me to become.

Now, at home, I’m trying to make sense of what my new 

role is in this weird in-between stage of life, while the 
world does the same around me. Unlike most conventional 
breakups, I can’t really rebound right now. I can’t go out to 
my town’s movie theater, sit in the square outside the café 
and have my cup of coffee, fall in love with the laughter 
and community and collective being of another place. 

So I’m doing what I can. Writing, lots. Processing 

in the only way I know how. Talking to friends on the 
phone. Trying to not beat myself up for the days when 
productivity seems near impossible, when I give in to 
consuming various forms of mind-numbing media from 
the comforts of my couch. Recognizing that, as with all 
heartbreaks, I will heal — it’s just going to take some time 
to get over this one.
