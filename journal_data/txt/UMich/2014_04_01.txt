Following one of the warmest
days of the year, some students
felt inclined to stay outside well
into the night with one goal in
mind: to secure a spot at Presi-
dent Barack Obama's address on
campus Wednesday.
On Monday, the University
announced plans to issue alim-
ited number of tickets to attend
the address, which will be held
at the Intramural Sports Build-
ing at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday. The
University said tickets would

be distributed on a first-come,
first-served basis to students,
prompting many to pack bags
for a long, chilly night waiting
outside the north doors to the
Union.
At 5:30 p.m. Monday, almost
16 hours before tickets for
Obama's Wednesday campus
address were set to be distribut-
ed, LSA freshmen Janie Brown
and Sydney Grant, as well as
LSA sophomores Olivia Mason
and Lizzy Brilliant, were
already waiting in line outside
the Michigan Union, as the first
four in line to get tickets Tues-
day morning.
By 11 p.m., lines stretched to
about 500 students, with more
arriving each minute. Plan-
ning for a long night, many
groups brought tents, food and
entertainment. At the front of
the line, Brown and Grant said
the experience was well worth

Attorney General
Schuette's defense
of ban on same-sex
marriage questioned
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
Almost immediately after Fed-
eral Judge Bernard Friedman's
March 21 ruling that Michi-
gan's same-sex marriage ban
was unconstitutional, Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette
filed for an emergency stay. Sat-
urday, after almost 300 couples
married in the state, that stay
was granted and later lengthened
into a more permanent stay that
will last for the duration of the
appeals process.
While Schuette is not the first
attorney general to be put in this
position, he is one of the first
to fight the appeal of the ban so
vigorously and also do so in the
midst of a re-election campaign.
In several statements to the
press, Schuette said his motiva-
tion is to defend both the will
of the people and Michigan's
Constitution -which has raised
questions about what the role
of an attorney general is during
this situation, given the actions
of attorney generals in previous
cases. The U.S. Attorney General
also issued a directive earlier this
year advising state attorney gen-
erals not to fight the overturning

of gay marriage bans.
During similar cases in Ken-
tucky and California, state attor-
ney generals have chosen to allow
the case to move through the
courts without getting directly
involved. Instead, other inter-
ested parties, such as the propo-
nents of the original bans, were
the ones who filed for the appeal.
Law Prof. Samuel Bagenstos
said Schuette's actions sppear
to have a deeper motivation
than what he has stated. Bagen-
stos added that getting directly
involved in the filling for the stay
steps out of the requirements of
his office.
"The waythat he has described
what he's doing is that simply that
he's carrying his obligations out
as attorney general and I'd say
that's not right," Bagenstos said.
"I think the only justification for
him to be doing what he's doing is
that he trulybelieves that it's con-
stitutional for a state to prohibit
people of the same sex from get-
ting married."
On Monday afternoon, Joy
Yearout, the attorney general's
director of communications,
reiterated that Schuette's moti-
vation is to defend the Michigan
constitution. She added that, to
Schuette, the other state attor-
neys' decisions to remain unin-
volved in similar cases is wrong.
"Attorney generals across the
country have a responsibility and
a duty to defend the constitution
and that's what we're doing here

Ambassador
talks changing
U.S. diplomacy

Richard Boucher
says social media is
important to reach
a global audience
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
On Monday, Ambassador
Richard Boucher delivered a
lecture to students at the Ford
School of Puhlic Policy Monday,
addressing the United States'
changing role as a world leader
and how the rise of social net-
working and new technologies
have affected modern diplo-
macy.
Boucher's tenure as assis-
tant secretary of state for public
affairs at the U.S. Department
of State was the longest in his-
tory. After earning a B.A. from
Tufts University and doing
graduate work at George Wash-
ington University, he worked
as an ambassador to Cyprus
and U.S. Consulate General in
Hong Kong. He also served as
the spokesman of the Depart-
ment of State for six secretaries

of state,including Colin Powell,
Condoleezza Rice and Mad-
eleine Albright.
In his lecture, Boucher said
the power of the Internet has
changed the dynamics of inter-
national diplomacy. He said the
United States wields the most
power internationally, not only
due to its large army and reach
in foreign markets, hut also
through its global connectivity
through branding and culture
exporting.
"We no longer live in a world
of blocks and paths, we live in
a world of nodes and connec-
tions," Boucher said. "In our
world, everyone's connected.
Countries and teenagers, NGOs
and corporations, students in
universities and parents. Tradi-
tional measures of power don't
capture the changing nature in
the power of diplomacy."
For the United States to stay
a leader in international rela-
tions, Boucher said it must make
its actions open to the modern
media and accessible for citi-
zens to build credibility around
the world because "trust is what
turns power into influence."

Approximately
120 students came
to laud the 13th
president's service
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily Staff Reporter
University President Mary
Sue Coleman's final monthly
fireside chat was more than a
little different this time around
as approximately 120 students
filled the Michigan Union's
Pendleton room for a surprise.

While Coleman typically
invites a random selection of
students for her fireside chats,
more than the anticipated
amount of students came to
applaud Coleman on her ser-
vice as the University's 13th
president.
E. Royster Harper, vice pres-
ident for student life, joined
Coleman for the monthly event,
which Coleman continued at
the beginning of her tenure.
During her presidency, Cole-
man and Harper have orga-
nized fireside chats to field
students' questions and con-
cerns in a more intimate set-

ting.
LSA junior Michael Chrzan,
the student event coordinator
for the surpise, said he aspired
to make Coleman's last fireside
chat memorable to honor her
commitment to students during
her tenure.
"We wanted this to be really
special because she made hear-
ing students' voices a priority
and that's not something that
comes intrinsically with every
president," Chrzan said. "We
wanted to give back in a small
way, to say 'thank you' for put-
ting themselves on the line and

Prof. plans future of education

NICE TIE

GautamAhuja is the Harvey C.
Fruehauf Professor of Business
Administration and professor
of Strategy in the Ross School of
Business. He spent 12 years as the
chairperson of The Strategy Area
at the Business School and is a.
Ph.D. coordinator. BusinessWeek
ranked Professor Ahuja second on
their list of "Most Popular Profs at
Top Business Schools." He is cur-
rently on a taskforcefor redesign-
ing the MBA program.
Could you describe MBA task
force you are apart of?
We are basically looking at
the MBA program and what
should the MBA graduates from

our institution be prepared for
as they enter the work force
and look forward to the next 20
or 30 years. So from that per-
spective, we've gone deep into
trying to understand what are
precisely the skills required for
an MBA, and what are the ways
we can use the experience they
have at the Ross School of Busi-
ness to develop those skills.
What is the biggest change
the MBA program is going to
experience?
As of now, the task force is
still working. It's going to take
several months more yet. The
way things work, the task force

will come up with a draft. That
draft will then be reviewed fur-
ther by the school and faculty,
and at some time be voted upon
by the faculty. Right now, we're
nowhere near that stage yet.
What is your favorite class to
teach?
I teach this class on advanced
competitive analysis. I think
my problem is that, I find, that
every morning that I am teach-
ing the class, I am excited. It's
difficult for me to see which one
of the elements of the course is
more exciting. I tend to like all
of them.

Duderstadt Library
3D world brings
in-depth learning
experience to life
By KAITLIN ZURDOSKY
Daily StaffReporter
Inside the Duderstadt
Library is a three-dimensional
virtual world open to all depart-
ments, including the Michigan
Immersive Digital Experience
Nexus and one of its latest proj-
ects - the human cadaver.
Just one pair of 3D glasses and
a joystick gives users full access
to the hologram-like human
body. When the user steps onto
the platform, the image seems
to appear within centimeters
of their eyes and they are able
to control and perceive a vari-
ety of cross-sections within the
organs, tissues and bones any-
where within the body.
"It seems like it would only
be in movies you could do this,
but you are doing science,"
said Assistant Dentistry Prof.
Alex DaSilva, the director of
the Headache & Orofacial Pain
Effort lab. "You are learning and
doing research - you are going
one step further into a learning
experience,"
According to DaSilva, the

MIDEN is a tool that has helped
him to further his research in
a way that no other experience
has. He brings residents from
the School of Dentistry as well as
doctoral students to work inside
the virtual reality lab.
"It's a creative but effective
way to see information," DaSilva
said. "These are real slices of
data, and you can enlarge them,
rotate them and expand the area
in which you are interested.
Cuts that you can see here are
extremely hard to do in a tradi-
tional lab. The slices and ways
you can dissect and look at the
cadaver is amazing."
According to the software
developers, the 3D illusion occurs
from a process called active ste-
reo. Two images are projected
onto the screens, and the images
switch back and forth at about
110 times per second. The lenses
on the glasses are liquid crystals
that alternate from dark to clear
and are synchronized with the
images projected on the MIDEN
screens, powered by six comput-
ers. The glasses are accompa-
nied with trackers, delivering
a 3D illusion to the individual's
two eyes at his personal location
within the MIDEN.
"It's similar to the way we can
make amovingimage out of stills
because you have persistence
of vision - your brain stitches
them together into motion even

though it's a bunch of still pic-
tures," said software developer
Ted Hall. "It's a similar idea -
if we can switch back and forth
between the left and right imag-
es fast enough, you can perceive
the images in 3D."
The human cadaver is one of
many demos used in the MIDEN.
Students and professors in the
Taubman College of Architec-
ture and Urban Planning, the
mechanical engineering and
civil engineering departments
within the College of Engineer-
ing and the School of Art &
Design, among other schools,
have also used the MIDEN for a
variety of projects.
"I would say hardest thing is
that we have to deal with very
large data sets, in terms of per-
formance and backing up mem-
ory," said software developer
Sean Petty said.
DaSilva has been working
extensively with Eric Maslowski
and the other developers. He has
high hopes that these types of
experiences with real data will
be applicable outside of the lab
environment and eventually
within classrooms and other
accessible learning areas.
"This notion of these vir-
tual reality 'caves' (such as the
MIDEN) has been around since
the early 1990's," Hall said. "For
me, it's sort of the holy grail of
virtual reality visualizations."

Ambassador Richard Boucher, former Deputy Secretary General of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development, speaks about how diplomacy is functioning in an increasingly global and social world in Weil Hall in the
Ford School of Public Policy Monday.

AMBASSADOR
From Page 1
The ambassador said the
United States can better the
world if they "stop trying to be
Mr. Fix-It," and instead give
the people of other nations the
tools to fix their own countries.
During the lecture, he used his
iPhone to show the audience an
app that monitors air quality in
Beijing. By making this infor-
mation clear and accessible, the
United States gave the Chinese
citizens the spark they needed
to pressure the government into
bettering their lives, according
to Boucher.
"I have to say, I think our best
diplomacy is diplomacy where
we put the tools in other people's
hands," Boucher said.

Public Policy Dean Susan Col-
lins introduced the ambassador,
lauding his extensive career
and breadth of expertise in his
field. In her opening remarks,
she said the rise of social media
has changed the relationship
between the public and the gov-
ernment, but that Boucher is "no
stranger" to addressing these
influences on in American gov-
ernmental affairs.
"Having somebody with his
breadth of experience atthe high
levels of the tenure, who is now
out of office and can be candid,
that's a real opportunity," Collins
said after the talk.
Boucher currently teaches
two classes at the Ford School
through the Towsley Founda-
tion Policymaker in Residence
Program, which brings experts
in the field of national or inter-

national policymaking to work
with students and University
faculty members.
Public Policy graduate student
Kiana Shelton, who is currently
enrolled in a seven-week course
taught by the ambassador called
"Wielding Economic Power,"
said she appreciated Boucher's
wit and extensive knowledge in
foreign relations both in class
and during the lecture on Mon-
day.
"It was very candid and had
a bit of humor to it, but it is
highlighting something that is
extremely important - the world
is getting smaller via technology,
how we get along with differ-
ent countries, we're not sending
cables anymore," Shelton said.
"We have the ability to respond
and react at anytime no matter
what."

it.
"I've always wanted to see
President Obama in person and
I figured this may be my only
chance - or hopefully the first
of many - but if not, I figured
I might as well jump on this,"
Brown said. "I'm done with class
for the day, it's beautiful outside,
so I figured might as well, I'm not
doing anything else."
Grant agreed, adding that she's
not sure she'll have the opportu-
nity to witness such an event in
the future.
"I've always been told by rela-
tives that college is a really good
time to seize opportunities like
this, because you're not going to
get the chance afterwards," she
said.
Obama will come to Ann
Arbor to advocate for a proposed
increase in the federal minimum
wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10
an hour. In February, the presi-

Peter Sprigg, senior fellow
for policy studies at the Fam-
ily Research Council, wrote in a
statement there are certain nar-
row exceptions in which an attor-
ney general would be justified in
not defending a state law, but that
this case isn't one of them.
"Such a decision should only be
made when the state law violates
a clear and explicit provision of
the constitution or violates a clear
precedent of the U.S. Supreme
Court," he wrote. "No provision
of the U.S. Constitution refers
to marriage (or for that matter
to "sexual orientation") and no
Supreme Court decision has ever

U.S. workers.
LSA sophomore Stephen Culb-
ertson, communications director
for the College Democrats, said he
grew interested in politics during
the 2012 presidential campaigns,
when he and other members of
the College Democrats worked
for local chapters of Obama's
campaign.
"As a Michigan resident, I feel
it's important that we support our
low-wage workers," Culbertson
said. "I think an increase in the
minimum wage is long overdue."
Members of the College Dem-
ocrats also used the time wait-
ing to distribute petitions in an
effort to place gubernatorial can-
didate Mark Schauer and senate
candidate Gary Peters on the
ballot for upcoming elections in
November.
As the line grew in the late eve-
ning, students implemented an
unofficial numbering system that
allowed individuals to solidify
their position. Several students
marriage as the union of a man
and a woman, so those exceptions
do not apply here."
In context of Schuette's pre-
vious actions as attorney gen-
eral, his unprecedented direct
involvement does not come as a
surprise.
Schuette has been the attor-
ney general since 2011. Before
that, he sat on Michigan's Fourth
District Court of Appeals, was a
state senator and U.S. represen-
tative and ran the state's agricul-
tural department under former
Governor John Engler. For all of
the elected positions he's held,
including attorney general, he has
run as a Republican.
Schuette has taken conserva-
tive stances in previous cases
as well. In 2012, following the
Obama administration's mandate
that birth control be included in
will take place at Seva's previ-
ous location before Jerusalem
Garden opens its new doors.
The heating and cooling system,
electrical system, floor plan,
kitchen equipment and kitchen
ventilation will be renovated
and the color scheme will stay
true to the original Jerusalem
Garden location.
Ramlawi said he hopes to
keep the layout convenient for
both take-out and dine-in cus-
tomers. He said he also plans
to increase access to catering
and accommodate more student
customers.

said the system was beneficial
because it permitted individuals
in line to leave for short periods
of time and still maintain their
standing.
Late Monday night, University
Police said they could not com-
ment on specific security mea-
sures, but said they were aware of
the situation and were monitoring
for potential hazards. Culbertson
said students he had observed had
been well-behaved and respect-
ful.
"I think it's a generally positive
environment," Culbertson said.
"With the numbers - students
decided they wanted to make it
more of a safe and healthy envi-
ronment."
LSA freshman Austin Delsi,
number 319 in line, said he heard
about the event through an Ins-
tagram post by The Michigan
Daily and was later alerted about
the growing line by a friend who
arrived earlier.
"Graduating from college in a
couple years, the minimum wage
is something that's really relevant
to me - especially with summer
jobs and internships," he said.
the health care plans of a large
number of religious organiza-
tions, he called himself a leader
in a nationwide effort by attor-
ney generals to repeal the man-
date. In 2011, he spoke out against
medical marijuana use, leading to
a brief recall effort against him
that was ultimately unsuccessful.
Bagenstos said that most attor-
ney generals generally do not con-
sider themselves apolitical, with
Schuette not being an exception
to that rule.
"He's obviously conservative.
His positions line up much more
with conservative politics than
with some clear objective sense
of the role of an attorney general
independent of politics, " Bagen-
stos said. "So I don't think it's
much of a surprise that he's taken
positions that align with conser-
vative politics."
Jerusalem Garden's menu
will expand as well, and will
potentially include chicken
kebabs, French fries, additional
lamb dishes, juices and smooth-
ies. Ramlawi said he foresees
more authentic fare and home-
cooked dishes, while keeping
the original flavors and dishes
of the menu.
Public support is already
positive, as the Facebook
post signed by "The Ram-
lawi Family" announcing
the move received more than
1,000 likes within a 24 hour
period.

answering students' questions."
Even though double the
number of students attended
the event, Chrzan said -he was
pleased that they managed to
maintain a sense of "intimacy,"
which he said was important
to Coleman during her tenure.
Though the event took about
twice as long to plan and exe-
cute, he said he was pleased
with the turnout and result
because the crowd was "excep-
tional."
While student questions
hit upon a range of topics and
issues concerning student life,
a consistent thread focused on
Coleman's own legacy. After
one student asked for her most
prominent memories from her
12-year tenure as University
president, Coleman's quick list
recounted some of the biggest
events at the University, both
positive and negative over the
past decade.
Coleman touched on the 2003
landmark Supreme Court cases
on affirmative action, which she
fought for in Washington D.C.
She added that she will remem-
ber witnessing University stu-
dents' reaction on the Diag to

the passage of Proposal 2, which
eliminated the use of race-based
admissions process in the state.
Coleman also cited the loss of
a University transplant team in a
plane crash, which she said she
will "remember forever."
Coleman answered questions
from the edge of her seat, trying
to squeeze in as many questions
in as possible in the one-hour
chat.
Another student in the front
row asked about the University's
green initiatives. Coleman said
while the University has always
stressed sustainability, remain-
ing realistic is important.
"What I have always tried
to do is to challenge us, hold us
accountable, but not be unre-
alistic," Coleman said. "I don't
see a way, unless there are huge
changes in technology, that we
can become carbon neutral in
the next 20 years. I just can't get
there, and I don't want to pre-
tend that we can do something
we can't."
on a lighter note, one student
asked Coleman what's next for
her and husband Ken Coleman.
Coleman said she plans keep
busy during her retirement.
"I'll be able to say no if I
really don't want to do some-
thing," Coleman said as the room
responded with laughter. "But
we have a place in Ann Arbor; we

bought a condo a few years ago,
so we'll be here for part of the
year and in Colorado for part of
the year. I've joined two founda-
tion boards - these are places
that give money away rather
than asking for money. I love ask-
ing for money, but now that I'm
on these foundation boards, I'll
be able to give money away."
More laughs from the students
followed.
As a student coordinator, Chr-
zan has attended most of the
fireside chats this year, and said
he believes he has seen firsthand
how an effective leader interacts
with others, adding that Cole-
man "leads by example" and that
her impact on students is evident
as a result.
There are just over three
months until University Presi-
dent-elect Mark Schlissel takes
over Coleman's office in the
Fleming Building in July. In light
of the upcoming administrative
change, many students asked
what the 13th president's legacy
will be. Coleman said she was
proud of her work.
"I think legacies are best
determined by others, rather
than by me," Coleman said. "But
I hope that when people look
back, they will believe that I left
the University a better place than
I found it. It's been the most won-
derful experience of my life."

Washington calls for federal
aid with mudslide clean-up

Death toll rises
to 24 as recovery
efforts continue
DARRINGTON, Wash. (AP) -
Estimated financial losses from
the deadly Washington mudslide
that has killed at least 24 people
have reached $10 million, Gov.
Jay Inslee said Monday in a letter
asking the federalgovernment for
a major disaster declaration.
In seeking additional fed-
eral help following one of the
deadliest landslides in U.S. his-
tory, Inslee said about 30 families
need assistance with housing,
along with personal and house-
hold goods. The estimated losses
include nearly $7 million in struc-
tures and more than $3 million in
their contents, Inslee's letter said.
The Snohomish County medi-
cal examiner's office said Monday
afternoon that it has received a
total of 24 victims, and 18 of those
have been publicly identified.
Previously, the official death toll
was 21, with 15 victims identified.

The remains of three addi-
tional victims were found Mon-
day, but they have not yet been
included in the medical examin-
er's official numbers, Snohomish
County Executive Director Gary
Haakenson told reporters at a
Monday evening briefing.
The county sheriff's office
released alist of22 people believed
missing following the March 22
slide that destroyed a rural moun-
tainside community northeast of
Seattle. That's down from the 30
people officials previously consid-
ered missing.
"There's been an exhaustive
effort by the detectives to narrow
the list down to one that they feel
comfortable releasing," Haaken-
son said.
"These are 22 people whose
loved ones are grieving," he said.
"We want to do all we can to find
them and put some closure in
place for their families."
He said there could be some
overlapbetween the list of missing
and the handful of victims who
have not been positively identified
by the medical examiner.

Steve Harris, a division super-
visor for the search effort, said
Monday that search teams have
been learning more about the force
of the slide, helping them better
locate victims in a debris field that
is 70 feet deep in places.
"There's a tremendous amount
of force and energy behind this,"
Harris said of the slide.
Harris said search dogs are the
primary tool for finding victims,
and searchers are finding human
remains four to six times per day.
Sometimes crews only find partial
remains, which makes the identi-
fication process harder.
Inslee's request Monday also
seeks federal help with funeral
expenses, and mental health care
programs for survivors, volun-
teers, community members and
first responders.
He also is asking for access to
disaster housing, disaster grants,
disaster-related unemployment
insurance and crisis counseling
programs for those in Snohomish
County and for the Stillaguamish,
Sauk-Suiattle and Tulalip Indian
tribes.

Enabling campus
The 'U' should provide more resources and information on disabilities
Last year, nearly 5 percent of students at the University were registered
as having a disability with the Services for Students with Disabilities.
Michigan ranks second-highest in SSD registered students among
Big Ten schools. Students and staff came together Wednesday to spread
disabilities awareness at speakABLE, an event presented by the SSD Senior
Advisory Board. The event featured testimonials from disabled students on
campus who praised the University's efforts and called for change in University
policy and atmosphere. Though the University has taken positive measures to
accommodate students with disabilities, additional resources and information
should be provided to reach equality for these students.

BOGDAN BELEI I
Weeding out oppression

On March 12, The Michigan Daily
published a column titled "Mari-
juana Misconceptions," in which the
author expressed an alarmed posi-
tion to many Americans' perceptions
of marijuana as a "benign" substance.
The article claimed that the federally
classified Schedule I drug poses signif-
icant and permanent health concerns
that should dissuade any further legal-
ization of the dangerous drug. what
the article failed to mention is that the
classification of marijuana as a drug
equivalent, in public health concern, to
heroin as Schedule I drugs occurred in
the Controlled Substance Act of 1970.
Over the past four decades, the impact
of marijuana's harsh classification
has led to a halt in health research, an
extremely costly war on drugs and the
further deepening of racial divides.
In recent years, the public attitude
toward marijuana has provided many
Americans with the hope of future
reform. with both Colorado and
washington passing referendums to
legalize marijuana throughout most
of their state boundaries, some believe
that the nation has reached a social
tipping pointof the drug's acceptance.
Despite the fact that the 1970s have
been commonly referenced for its
carefree, drug-induced attitudes -
public opinion polls in 2013 showed
that for the first time, Americans
favored marijuana legalization. With
58 percent in favor, the results exhibit
morethandoublethe supportreported
in 1977 and signify a 14-percent
increase in support just in the past two
years. These recent developments in
legislation and social attitudes, along
with a rapidly increasing marijuana
lobby group, lead to speculation that
the trend towards state legalization of
marijuana will continue.
Though there has been relatively
limited research onthe long-termcon-
sequences, marijuana has been proven
to have only mildly negative health
effects, at worst compared to other
vices such as cigarettes and alcohol.
The reason research has been limited
is largely because of the convoluted

and restricting bureaucratic approach
the government takes on marijuana.
As Dr. Sanjay Gupta mentioned last
year in a public address on the health
benefits of marijuana, progress in
marijuana studies continues to be a
challenge due to the unavailability of
the drug for research, and due to the
fact that the organization approving
marijuana research - the National
Institute on Drug Abuse - is inher-
ently focused on abuse rather than
the benefits.
Despite this, there are thousands
of individuals serving extensive sen-
tences - in some cases, life sentenc-
es - for non-violent and petty drug
convictions involving marijuana. In a
country with a racially disproportion-
ate legal system, where the African
American population in the United
States is18.4 percent,but 40 percent in
its jails and prisons, the war on drugs
has created a racially institutionalized
system of oppression. The implication
of the institutionalized targeting of
low-income areas has led to the cre-
ation of an entire population segment
of minority offenders, who are dis-
criminated against, disenfranchised
and socially isolated. This has persist-
ed for more than 40 years, decimating
multiple generations and further cre-
ating racial divides which will require
mending and reconciliation.
In a recent article, Michelle Alex-
ander, author of New York Times
bestseller "The New Jim Crow: Mass
IncarcerationintheAgeof Colorblind-
ness," emphasized the importance of a
conscience transition from incarcer-
ating millions of Black men for minor
marijuana offenses to allowing small
groups of white men to make millions
once the drug is deemed legal. Com-
paring the transition to the end of the
apartheid in South Africa, Alexander
said, "You can't just destroy a people
and then say 'It's over, we're stopping
now.' You have to be willing to deal
with the truth, deal with the history
openly and honestly." Indeed, it is not
permissible to accept the reality of the
past several decades allowing poor,

underprivileged minorities to suffer
from a disproportionately discrimina-
tory system, and then simply decide
that someone else will profit off of
their burden. For decades, it has been
proven that marijuana use has been
equal or even higher among whites
when compared to minorities, but the
privilege of living in suburbs and on
college campuses has provided a sense
of security and a double standard for
offenders of the exact same crimes.
With the recent realization of
the disparity among race and class
throughoutthe War onDrugs,it is nec-
essary for lawmakers to take advan-
tage of current public support and
eliminate crippling and unproductive
drug laws. The U.S. prison system is
overcrowded. In a country composing
only 5 percent of the world's popula-
tion, the criminal justice system hous-
es 25 percent of the world's prisoners.
Not only has the War on Drugs proven
to be costly and an issue of economic
feasibility, it has prolonged the history
of racial injustice. The mass incar-
ceration of minorities has only further
impoverished the status and social
capital of America's diversity. Histori-
ans will view the War on Drugs as the
third era of oppression, following the
Jim Crow laws of the 1870s and the
African slave system dating back to
before the conception ofthe U.S.
The decriminalization of mari-
juana - a non-lethal substance -
must be supported as a practical
solution to unnecessary persisting
problems in the U.S. legal system.
For most, marijuana will continue
to be a vice, a bad habit. For oth-
ers, it will prove to be effective
medicine. Regardless of its use, the
stakes for continuing its current
discrimination are too high and too
costly. As Michelle Alexander rea-
sonably states, "I can tell you that
I'm far more worried about my kids
needlessly going to jail and being
relegated to a permanent second-
class status than getting high."

SpeakABLE was part of a series of events for
SSD's 40th anniversary. The event featured a
panel of students who shared personal stories
regarding disability at the University. One
student addressed the lack of clear emergency
evacuation procedures for physically disabled
students in residence halls, particularly calling
attention to "deplorable" protocols during a fire
drill. Other topics of discussion centered on
the challenge deaf students face during large
lecture events and the "otherness" of disabled
individuals in the campus community.
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act,
the Universityis requiredto provide reasonable
public accommodations, and seems to work
hard to do so. However, emergency evacuation
procedures must also be updated to better
address the needs of disabled students. Clear
plans should be set for evacuating disabled
students from residence halls in the case of
an emergency. These should be included in an
updated version of the Office of Institutional
Equity's Emergency Evacuation for Persons on
Campus with Disabilities protocol.
Though SSDprovides positive aid for disabled
students, the University should increase
awareness and accessibility of this resource.
To inform all new students of its available
programming and services, and raise awareness
about disability on campus in general, the
SSD office should be included in orientation
tours. It should further increase transparency
by clarifying the registration process.

Prescheduling for accommodation at student
events, like mass meetings and speaker events,
another concern raised at the panel, should be
simplified. Further, the existence of any and all
resources should be clarified and publicized by
the Universityso students can utilize them.
To generate a comprehensive understanding
of disabilities across campus, the University
should create a disabilities studies
concentration. At the very least, the University
should offer more relevant classes pertaining
to historical treatment, political initiatives
and social power dynamics of physical and
mental ability in society and academia. While
the University offers courses on many different
groups, it lacks undergraduate academic
curricula indisabilities studies. Such aprogram
has been proposed in the past and should be
implemented to fully represent diverse groups
in University coursework. This program
would create greater acceptance of disabilities,
bridging the gap between able-bodied and
disabled individuals on campus.
While the University has created positive
resources to accommodate disabled students,
certain changes should be implemented to help
those who could benefit from them. Increased
information about SSD registration process and
resources would aid all disabled students, and
a disabilities studies program would promote
greater acceptance. Every individual at the
University should have an equal opportunity to
succeed, and disabled students are no exception.

Take peace seriously

Snyder the wimp

When Rick Snyder was running for
governor and became the lovable
"nerd" who won the votes of most
Michiganders, many saw
hope for a new breed of
Republican in him. People
sawhisbusinessbackground
and conservatism as the
perfect medicine for the
downtrodden economy,
and many believed his_
stance on social issues were
far from the Tea Party PATRICK
extremism found in the MAILLET
state legislature. During his
campaign, whenever he was
asked about social issues ranging from women's
health to LGBTQ rights, Snyder simply stated
that those issues were not on his agenda and
that fixing the economy was his main concern.
Most people believed this meant that Snyder was
going to focus on the economy and not worry
about archaic social issuesthat only the religious
right fights against.
Oh how wrong we were ...
What we have come to learn these last few
years is that Snyder is undoubtedly focused
primarily on economics, but when it comes to
social issues he has essentially let the radical
members of his party take control and pass
whatever legislation they see fit. During his
tenure as governor, Snyder has signed count-
less laws that severely limit women's right
to choose and diminished the rights of the
LGBTQ community.
As state Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) said
in a phone interview last week, "Governor Sny-
der consistently avoids taking a side on social
issues.When he was first elected, we all thought
that maybe he would be a different type of
Republican. Instead, he has demonstrated that
it's not that he opposes these social topics, it's
just that he only cares about economic issues."
Irwin went on to say, "These issues:
women's rights, LGBT equality ... they're just
not on his radar screen."
Michiganders were painfully reminded of
this trend last week when U.S. District Judge
Bernard Friedman ruled Michigan's same-sex
marriage ban unconstitutional. The very next
day, more than 300 same-sex couples were
married before a federal appeals court issued
a stay, preventing more marriages until the
case is heard by a higher court. In response to
these marriages, Governor Snyder said that the
unions were "legal" and "valid," but that the
state willnot recognize themnor offer themthe
same benefits given to heterosexual couples.

Just when we thought Michigan would
be a forward-thinking state, we were
painfully reminded that our state government
is controlled by radical members of the
religious right.
Snyder'sstanceonthese300marriagesisjust
the newest example of his inability to actually
take a stand on a social issue. Critics throughout
the country have criticized Snyder's 'legal, but
not thatlegal' statement, and most attorneys on
either side of the aisle are acknowledging that
Snyder is probably in the wrong. As Ken Mogill,
one of the lawyers challenging the same-sex
marriage ban, stated last week, "I would not
want to be one of the Governor's lawyers trying
to defend that position in court. It's kind of a
head-spinning position."
Irwin also commented on Snyder'sstatement,
saying, "I have to be honest, I don't understand
his position because it makes no sense."
I understand where Snyder is coming from
politically. He has to appeal to his radical
base and come out and oppose same-sex
marriage. But instead of coming out and
openly saying that he opposes this court
ruling, Snyder - like always - is trying to
have it both ways. He wants to appear against
same-sex marriage to appeal to religious
voters, yet also wants to attract independents
by claiming indifference and stating that he's
simply upholding the law.
"He's just trying to make it less obvious that
he's on the wrongside of history," Irwin said in
reaction to Snyder's remarks.
Though Snyder and Michigan Attorney
General Bill Schuette have a duty to defend
the Michigan Constitution, they have also
sworn an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution.
With the Supreme Court's ruling last summer
striking down the Defense of Marriage Act
and a recent ABC News-Washington Post poll
showing that 59 percent of Americans support
same-sex marriage, one can't help but see the
writing on the wall.
Snyder loves to refer to himself as "one
tough nerd." I have no doubt that Snyder is
an intelligent man, but over these past couple
of years he has shown that he is nothing
more than a number-cruncher who doesn't
care about current social issues that leave
Michigan years behind most of the country.
The Governor has repeatedly refused to stand
up to the Tea Party radicals within the state
legislature. He may see himself as a nerd, but I
see little more than a wimp.

Enough.
Enough of the divisive rhetoric.
Enough of the unequal coverage.
Enough of the half-truths that have
dominated the conversation. Enough
of sitting quietly on the sideline,
waiting for the facts to win the day -
that clearly is not happening.
I am a Zionist. I support the
existence of Israel. I believe in a
two-state solution, where Israel
remains a majority Jewish state.
And after millennia of persecution,
diasporas and attempted genocides,
I am not going to apologize for
the way I feel. I am not going to
forget that Israel was born in the
aftermath of the Holocaust. And
I am not going to dismiss the fact
that Israel's boundaries exist in
their current form because all of
her neighbors have tried to wipe
her off of the map, repeatedly.
The conversation on campus
these past two weeks about divesting
from companies doing business in
Israel has been hurtful, it has been
filled with inaccuracies and it has
done nothing to support peace or
reconciliation between the opposing
sides. Students Allied for Freedom
and Equality has vilified the Central
Student Government, slurred the
students that oppose its resolution,
and misrepresented its own agenda.
It's time the truth is told.
To begin, SAFE's voice was not
"silenced." SAFE has now presented
its proposal twice to CSG, and twice
our student government voted "no." I
understand a groupomay be frustrated
that its proposal did not pass. But
when a group's proposal (twice) does
not pass a democratically elected
representative student body, which
(twice) acted firmly in line with its
rules of procedure, the group has
not been silenced. It has been heard
(twice). And in this case, it has been
heard louder and clearer than most
groups ever are.
Second, the CSG was right to
vote the way it did. One of the
three requirements for divestment
is that the view must be "broadly
and consistently held on campus
over time," and reflect "a broad

campus consensus." SAFE asked
CSG to affirm that its resolution
possessed this type of support.
This is something the CSG could
not do, because this type of support
does not exist. In its resolution,
SAFE offered zero legitimate
evidence that its proposal enjoyed
a consensus. The only support it
provided were citations to three
Michigan Daily pieces - pieces
members of SAFE authored -
that showed nothing in the way
of campus consensus for its view.
In stark contrast, two weeks of a
divided campus and six and a half
hours of divided debate point in the
opposite direction.
Third, SAFE's resolution is not
about human rights. It is about
delegitimizing and weakening the
State of Israel. If SAFE cared only
about human rights, then it is beyond
suspect that it only pushed for
divestiture from companies having
dealings with Israel. If SAFE cared
only about human rights, it would
have included companies doing
business with tens, if not hundreds, of
other countries. China is an obvious
example. So is Israel's neighbor,
Syria, who has killed more than
100,000 civilians since the start of its
civil war. And so are the Palestinian
extremisits, who shoot rockets daily
at Israeli civilians. But these offenders
are notably absent from SAFE's
resolution on human rights.
I am not saying Israel has not
violated human rights laws. To the
contrary, I am sure that she has -
as is true with every nation (see:
waterboarding, United States). But
Israel is a true and functioning
democracy, the only one in a region
that is largely hostile to its right
even to exist. One does not need to
be an expert in international affairs
to know that Israel's record on
human rights is not even in the same
ballpark as many of the countries to
which the University's, as well as all
other universities', investments are
linked. Claiming that this resolution
is strictly for human rights, under
the dubious pretense that "you need
to start somewhere," is as offensive

as it is calculated.
If this resolution were for any
company operating in a country that
violates human rights, then I would
support it. But it is not. And that
omission is not innocent.
Fourth, SAFE's strategy is not
one that encourages peace or
reconciliation between the opposing
sides. Rather,it is one that has further
divided our campus, made students
on all sides feel uncomfortable
and intimidated and led to threats
aimed at members of the CSG. It is a
strategy that calls one side a villain
and ignores any of its own culpability
for the sorry state of current affairs.
If SAFE was interested in peace
and ending the occupation, a much
more prudent strategy would have
been to reach out to the opposing
side and discuss a bilateral action.
Both sides want human rights to be
respected. Both sides could make
steps towards peace. But proposing
a divisive resolution, which could
not have passed CSG no matter who
presented it, and which paints a
complex story in black and white, is
not a strategy interested in peace.
I was at the CSG meeting this past
Tuesday.I heard the speeches from
both sides. If any of the students who
spoke can be taken at their word,
this campus is ready to sit down
and discuss real solutions. I know
for a fact that pro-Israel students
are currently trying to meet with
SAFE and open a dialogue with the
goal of producing real, viable results.
If SAFE is serious about peace -
which would go a long way toward
protecting the human rights of both
sides - I would expect them to agree
to this.
But continuing to lob uneven
rhetoric and insults is not a genuine
path towards peace. And as long as
SAFE continues to push a resolution
that singles out Israel, thinly veiled
under the banner of human rights,

was particularly surreal.
Good sketch shows are very dif-

can be annoyingly self-indulgent
and (the very worst insult you

But done well, and we get "Monty

Behind the vulgarity of "Kroll

Nick Kroll. The guy has always
had talent but this series might
just be his crowning achievement.
It's over-the-top, nonsensical and
possibly genius for a sketch com-
edy featuring a character named
C-Czar.

I like to say that my firstconcert
came in 9th grade because, well,
I was young enough to need ear
plugs for my actual first concert.
I don't remember my age, specifi-
cally, but I do
recall the trip
to some bar
downtown,
where my
dad hoisted
me on his
shoulder and
we watched ELLIOT
a '90s staple ALPERN

rock out onstage. I think I liked
one of their songs at the time; the
rest is a blur from so many years
ago.
But the show I like to imagine
as my real first show came in the
spring of my freshman year of
high school, well before I could
drive myself to downtown Pitts-
burgh and catch something at
Mellon Arena (where the Pen-
guins used to play, fyi.). One
weekend, my father once again
surprised me with tickets to a
concert - perhaps my favorite
band at the time, Wolfmother.
There was just one complication:
We would have to drive to Cleve-
land and back, two hours each
way, on a Sunday night.
Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a
problem. But, as this was begin-
ning of my formative years in high
school, I had a lot on my plate.
The day after that Sunday, I was
to begin conditioning practice on
the high school lacrosse team -
sure to be an absolute mire after
a night spent driving to see a rock
and roll band.
I wouldn't be stopped, though.
This was Wolfmother before
they broke up, right after they'd
released that spectacular debut
album. It's one I haven't listened

U.S. and Israel discuss
release of spy prisoner

Jonathan Pollard
maybe freed to
advance peace talks
inthe Middle East
JERUSALEM (AP) - The
United States is talking with
Israel about releasing convicted
spy Jonathan Pollard early from
his life sentence as an incentive
to the Israelis in the troubled
Mideast peace negotiations,
people familiar with the talks
said Monday. Releasing Pollard,
a thorn in U.S.-Israeli relations
for three decades, would be an
extraordinary step underscoring
the urgency of U.S. peace efforts.
Two people describing the
talks cautioned that such a
release - which would be a dra-
matic turnaround from previous
refusals - was far from certain
and that discussions with Israel
on the matter were continuing.
Both spoke only on condition of
anonymity because they were
not authorized to discuss the
talks on the record.
In return for the release, the
people close to the talks said,
Israel would have to under-
take significant concessions
to the Palestinians in Middle
East negotiations. Such conces-
sions could include some kind
of freeze on Israeli settlements
in disputed territory, the release
of Palestinian prisoners beyond
those Israel has already agreed
to free and a guarantee that
Israel would stay at the negotiat-
ing table beyond an end-of-April
deadline.
Secretary of State John Kerry
met for several hours late Mon-
day with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu before sit-
ting down with chief Palestin-
ian negotiator Saeb Erekat and
another Palestinian official.
Kerry was expected to meet
again Tuesday morning with
Netanyahu before flyingto Brus-
sels for NATO talks on Ukraine.
U.S. defense and intelli-
gence officials have consistently
argued against releasing Pollard.
Pollard, an American Jew,
was a civilian intelligence ana-
lvst for the U.S. Navy when he

gave thousands of classified
documents to his Israeli han-
dlers. The Israelis recruited him
to pass along U.S. secrets includ-
ing satellite photos and data on
Soviet weaponry in the 1980s.
He was arrested by FBI agents in
Washington in 1985 after unsuc-
cessfully seeking refuge at the
Israeli Embassy in Washington.
He pleaded guilty to leaking
classified documents to Israel
and received a life sentence.
President Barack Obama and
his predecessors have refused
to release Pollard despite pleas
from Israeli leaders.
Apart from any negotiations
in the meantime, Pollard could
be released from prison on Nov.
21, 2015 - 30 years after his
arrest. He has been serving his
sentence at a federal facility in
Butner, N.C.
White House spokesman Jay
Carney on Monday declined to
discuss any possible deal.
"He is a person who is con-
victed of espionage and is serv-
ing his sentence. I don't have any
updates on his situation," Car-
ney told reporters at the White
House.
Ahead of his trip to the Mid-
dle East last March, Obama told
Israeli television station Channel
2 that Pollard "is an individual
who committed a very serious
crime here in the United States."
"He's been serving his time,"
Obama said. "I have no plans
for releasing Jonathan Pollard
immediately but what Iam going
to be doing is to make sure that
he, like every other American
who's been sentenced, is accord-
ed the same kinds of review and
the same examination of the
equities that any other individu-
al would provide."
The president said at the time
that he recognized the emotions
involved in the situation. But he
added, "As the president, my first
obligation is to observe the law
here in the United States and to
make sure that it's applied con-
sistently."
Various suggestions for deals
for Pollard's release have been
floated over the years, and they
were raised again last week in
the Israeli press.
The long-running Middle

East peace negotiations are
snagged over several issues,
including wither Israel will
agree to release more than two
dozen prisoners. They include 14
Arab Israelis whom Palestinian
authorities consider to be heroes
and freedom fighters. Israel con-
siders them terrorists.
Israel has already released
three other groups of prison-
ers as part of the peace negotia-
tions that began last July. All had
served lengthy terms for involve-
ment in attacks on Israelis, and
scenes of them returning to jubi-
lant celebrations have angered
the Israeli public. A fourth batch
was scheduled to be released
on March 29, and the delay has
prompted Palestinian authori-
ties to threaten to end the nego-
tiations.
Netanyahu has said he would
present any additional release
recommendations to his Cabinet
- where approval is not guar-
anteed. Netanyahu's coalition is
dominated by hard-liners who
have been extremely critical of
the previous releases. The final
release is especially contentious
because it is expected to include
convicted murderers and Arab
citizens of Israel.
Carney declined to offer
details when asked about that
prisoner release. "This is a
complicated issue that is being
worked through with the par-
ties," he said.
Pollard is said to be in poor
health. His case has become a
rallying cry in Israel, where lead-
ers say his nearly three decades
in U.S. prison amounts to exces-
sive punishment. Pollard enjoys
widespread sympathy among
Israelis, and Netanyahu and
other Israeli leaders have rou-
tinely pressed Obama and other
U.S. presidents for his pardon or
release.
Stiff opposition from the
American military and intelli-
gence community has deterred
the White House. Intelligence
officials have argued that his
release would harm national
security and that the U.S. must
maintain a strong deterrent
to allies by warning them of
the consequences of spying on
American soil.

In this aerial photo, the Williams Northwest Pipeline plant is seen after a natural gas pipeline ruptured at the plant in Plym-
outh, Wash., Monday.
Gas plant explodes near
Oregon-Washlngton border

400 citizens forced
to evacuate area in
wake of disaster
GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) - A
large explosion rocked a natu-
ral gas processing plant on the
Washington-Oregon border Mon-
day, injuring four workers, caus-
ing about 400 people to evacuate
from nearby farms and homes,
and emitting a mushroom cloud
of black smoke that was visible for
more than a mile.
The 8:20 a.m. blast at the Wil-
liams Northwest Pipeline facil-
ity near the Washington town of
Plymouth, along the Columbia
River, sparked a fire and punc-
tured one of the facility's two
giant storage tanks for liquefied
natural gas.
Benton County Sheriff Ste-
ven Keane said a relatively small
amount of gas leaked from the
tank to the ground in a moat-like
containment area. But it then
evaporated, blowing away to the
northeast, he said.
"I think if one of those huge
tanks had exploded, it might have
been adifferentstory," Keane said.
The fire at the facility about 4
miles west of Plymouth was extin-
guished within a couple of hours.
One of the four injured work-
ers was transported to a Port-

land, Ore., hospital specializing
in burns, he said. The other three
were taken to Good Shepherd
Medical Center in Hermiston,
Ore., where spokesman Mark
Ettesvold said they were treated
in the emergency room for inju-
ries that did not appear to be life-
threatening.
More than a mile away across
the Columbia River, the explosion
shook Cindi Stefani's home:
"It was just a very loud boom,"
she said. "I looked across the river
and saw a giant mushroom cloud
and flames at least a couple hun-
dred feet high."
Animals on neighboring farms
were running around, she added.
"At that point we were pretty
scared. I was thinking, 'We need
to get out of here."'
Deputies went door to door to
homes and farms within a 2-mile
radius, evacuating about 400 resi-
dents as a precaution.
Buses were provided for those
without cars, and a shelter was set
up across the river in Oregon at
the Umatilla County Fairgrounds.
As part of the evacuation, High-
way 14 and railroad tracks were
shut down.
Deputy Joe Lusignan said the
voluntary evacuation could last
overnight. No one was being pre-
vented from returningto the evac-
uation area, which was calculated
based on the damage expected if

one of the two storage tanks blew
up.
The facility provides supple-
mental gas during times of high
demand for a 4,000-mile pipeline
stretching from the Canadian bor-
der to southern Utah. Its two stor-
age tanks for liquefied natural gas
each have a capacity of 1.2 billion
cubic feet, Williams spokeswom-
an Michele Swaner said. The one
that punctured was about a third
of the way full.
Swaner said the 14 employees
working at the time were all evac-
uated and accounted for. A total of
17 or 18 people work at the facility.
She added it was too early to
determine the extent of the dam-
age or the cause of the explosion.
The pipeline was shut down in the
area of the storage facility, but was
still carrying gas on other stretch-
es.
Video taken by a Washington
State Patrol bomb squad robot was
being evaluated, and plans were
being developed to send up aheli-
copter for an aerial assessment of
the facility, authorities said.
. A pipeline engineer with the
Washington Utilities and Trans-
portation Commission will inves-
tigate the cause of the explosion
and communicate with the western
region of the U.S. Department of
Transportation Pipeline and Haz-
ardous Materials Safety Adminis-
tration, the commissionsaid.

Russia pulls back a battalion.
from the Ukrainian border

Thousands of troops
leave Crimea, but
many remain in place
SIMFEROPOL, Crimea (AP)
- Russia said Monday it was
pulling a battalion of several
hundred troops away from the
Ukrainian border but kept tens of
thousands in place, prompting a
worried response from the Kiev
government about what the U.S.
warned was still a "tremendous
buildup."
Russia moved quickly to
strengthen its economic hold on
Crimea, with Prime Minister
Dmitry Medvedev arriving in the
newly annexed peninsula with
promises of funds for improved
power supplies, water lines,
education and pensions for the
elderly.
Russia's takeover of the stra-
tegic Black Sea region, its troop
buildup near Ukraine's border
and its attempts to compel consti-
tutional changes in Ukraine have
markedly raised tensions with
the West and prompted fears that
Moscow intends to invade other
areas of its neighbor.
However, Russian Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin told Ger-
man Chancellor Angela Merkel
in a phone call Monday that
some troops were being with-
drawn from the Ukraine border,
Merkel's office said. The with-
drawal involved a battalion of
about 500 troops, Russian news
reports said.
The U.S. reacted cautiously
to the Russian troop movement,
with Secretary of Defense Chuck
Hagel saying that "tens of thou-
sands" of Russian forces still
remained along the Ukrainian
border, a situation he called "a
tremendous buildup."
The new government in

Ukraine said the action only
increased its uneasiness about
Russia's intentions.
"We have information that
Russia is carrying out incompre-
hensible maneuvers on the bor-
der with Ukraine," Ukrainian
Foreign Ministry spokesman
Yevgen Perebyinis said. "Troops
in some places are moving back-
ward, some of them are moving
forward. Which is why, obviously,
we are worried by these move-
ments of armed forces. We have
no clear explanation from the
Russian side about the aim of
these movements."
Russian Foreign Minister Ser-
gey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of
State John Kerry also discussed
Ukraine by phone Monday, a day
after holding talks in Paris, the
Russian foreign ministry said.
A senior U.S. official said Lav-
rov had promised Kerry that a
division of Russian troops would
be pulled back; a division general-
ly consists of thousands of troops.
"Now there have been reports
of possible drawdowns of Russian
military forces from the border.
We haven't seen that yet, but if
they turn out to be accurate, that
would be a good thing," White
House spokesman Jay Carney
said.
Concerns of a possible inva-
sion of eastern Ukraine - home
to many ethnic Russians - were
stoked by the large numbers
of troops Russia had along the
Ukrainian border for what Mos-
cow said were military exercises.
One Russian battalion - about
500 troops - that had been sent to
the Rostov region next to Ukraine
was being withdrawn to its per-
manent base in the central Sama-
ra region, Russian news agencies
quoted the Defense Ministry as
saying Monday.
Alexander Rozmaznin, deputy
chief of the Ukrainian armed

forces command center, also con-
firmed a drop in Russian troop
numbers along the border.
In Kiev, meanwhile, Ukraine's
acting president flatly rejected
escalating Russian pressure to
turn Ukraine into a loose federa-
tion.
"Russia's leadership should
deal with problems in the Rus-
sian Federation, and not with
Ukraine's problems," Ukraine's
acting president Oleksandr
Turchinov said. "It is Ukrainians
that should dictate the form of
the new constitution and how the
country is structured."
Medvedev, who led a delega-
tion of Cabinet ministers on a sur-
prise visit to Crimea, pledged
that Russia would quickly boost
salaries and pensions and pour in
resources to improve education,
health care and local infrastruc-
ture.
But making no mistake about
Russia's view of the peninsula,
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry
Rogozin tweeted a photo of him-
self upon arrival with the words
"Crimea is ours, and that's that."
Russia's defense minister,
meanwhile, announced that all
Crimean men of conscription age
will get a deferral from the draft
for one year.
Russia annexed Crimea from
Ukraine in March after a hastily
called referendum just two weeks
after Russian forces took control
of the Black Sea region. Ukraine
and the West have rejected the
vote.
The annexation came after
Ukraine's president, Viktor Yan-
ukovych, was ousted in Febru-
ary and fled to Russia following
months of protests. Russia claims
the ouster was a coup and that
the new Ukrainian authorities
are nationalist fascists who will
abuse Ukraine's large ethnic Rus-
sian population.

team lost to Kentucky, 75-72, in
the Regional Semifinals - 20
minutes since it was four points
from a second straight Final Four.
appearance.
A 6-foot-8
fifth-year
senior
is doing
everything 1
he can to
hold back
tears after
his final SIMON
college KAUFMAN
basketball
game
- and failing to do so. Three
sophomores are answering
questions about their futures -
whether they'll stay another year
or not. A senior team manager in
khakis and a maize polo is sitting
on a water cooler with his head
down, trying to hide puffy red
eyes. He didn't play, but it was his
lastgame, too.
It's easy to say they're looking
forward to next year. Easy to
say how proud they were of
this past season. Easy to praise
Jordan Morgan, the lone player
graduating. It's easy to reflect,
easy to compliment the opponent
and to try, no matter how hard,
to keep their heads up and their
emotions back.
This isn't your YMCA youth
basketball league and not
everyone gets a trophy. And that's
not easy to accept, because after
the year Michigan had, it doesn't
seem fair it will leave empty-
handed.
It's not easy and maybe it's not
fair, either.
Maybe it's not fair to ask a
team that started the season
6-4 to compete for a National
Chamnionshin. Not fair to

expect that a team that lost two
starters to the NBA and an All-
American to an injury would win
the Big Ten title by three games.
Not fair to tella sophomore
who still wears braces that he
should've played better defense
on that last play.
Maybe everyone was caught
up in the lure of last year. Still
replaying Trey's shot, trying to
forget Harrison's. Maybe the
expectations weren't fair.
But, as is said, life is not fair,
not easy. And if ever there was
a microcosm to emphasize that
fact it would be sports. It would
be college sports. And it would be
March Madness.
Because in real life, 18-year-
old kids aren't asked tobe perfect
or be forgotten. But that happens
in college basketball, and it
happens every March.
And that's OK.
It's what makes a stadium of
35,551explode when a Wildcat
guard hits a deep 3-pointer with
two seconds left, and it's what
makes a six-year-oldboywearing
a maize Michigan jersey grab
his dad's leg and cry when a Nik
Stauskas heave misses a minute
later.
It's the reason Caris LeVert
is sitting in a chair in the locker
room with his legs sprawled out
and his arms crossed. He doesn't
look like the player that carried
the team many times this season.
He looks like a little boy who's
been put in timeoutby his mom
and told to think about his bad
behavior. The sophomore bops
his head every couple of seconds,
not like he's singing a songbut
more like he's replaying the
previous 40 minutes - thinking
about every play, what he
could've done differently so that
he wasn't sitting dejected and
expressionless after the game.
He doesn't deserve that feeling

- certainly not after the season
he had. But just down the hallway
from Michigan's locker room at
Lucas Oil Stadium there's a room
full of Kentucky players who don't
deserve that agony either.
And yet that's the reality
of it. It's the best time of the
year because anyone can take
the spotlight and any star can
become an afterthought. It's
Bowl Week, the Frozen Four
and Opening Day all wrapped
into one spectacular month.
And in reality, it's probably too
much emotion squeezed into a
four-week stretch highlighted
by 40-minute contests than is
healthy for us.
But we still prescribe it to
ourselves. Because no matter
how hard, how unfair, that's the
fun of it.
And just like each champion
holds the title temporarily, so too,
each loss fades away.
Across the locker room from
LeVert, Jon Horford playfully
flips Max Biefeldt the bird,
disapprovingofa quip Bielfeldt

talks with family on his way out
of the stadium. One fan tells him
that she watched every game. He
smiles.
With a swarm of reporters
around him, Michigan coach
John Beilein is level-headed. It's
hard to tell if his team just lost
in the NCAA Tournament or in
a preseason exhibition game.
He praises, reflects and looks
forward. That's the easy part.
Taking a team that had no
business having such high
expectations after roster
changes, and bringing it so close
to another Final Four, that's the
hard part.

not something that happens
very often. So how did she not
notice?
"My whole warm-up
preparation, I was very focused
and locked in," Wagner said.
"I was focusing on the little
things. In the past few weeks,
that's been a problem - I just
haven't been very sharp."
Wagner collected four
strikeouts and retired 19
batters in a row before she ran
into trouble in the bottom of the
seventh inning. With one out in
the seventh, Wagner hit Penn
State's Kasie Hatfield.
Up until that point, Wagner's
unwavering confidence had
allowed her to stay consistent.
After she hit Hatfield, though,
she allowed a single that
consequently ended , her
no-hitter. Her steadiness had
wavered.

strengths, and I also think it's
me being able to have a short
memory," Wagner said. "If
something goes wrong, I'm able
to go out there and just forget
about it because it's in the past.
If I walk a batter or hit a batter
or something, I forget about
that one and go onto the next

do about it."
Wagner displayed her ability
to quickly regain focus with
a pair of strikeouts to end

Habitz's single jump-started

to prevent the mercy rule from

Wagner's one poor inning
out of12 didn't worry Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins at all
though.
"Haylie pitches to her
strengths, and her pitching
coach calls to her strengths,"
Hutchins said. "It's not always
strikeouts, but the goal is to jam
them up and work them on the
other side on the plate and mix
it up. A good pitcher takes away
the batter's (timing). She just
does what she does - nothing
more, nothing less."
Wagner now boasts a 17-0

something that does.

Five Things We Learned:
'M'takes 2-of-3 from Iowa

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Sports Writer
1. When the Wolverines are
good, they're elite.
The Michigan baseball team
had asuccessful week.
The Wolverines have won
four of their last five games,
including three in the Big Ten
and two by one run. Wednesday,
they toppled Western Michigan
in a 12-4 blowout, but before
Iowa this weekend, questions
remained if they were just lucky
or have serious potential.
The latter was on display
when Michigan (3-3 Big Ten,
12-15-1 overall) won the series
against the Hawkeyes, 2-1, and
remained tied for fourth in the
conference. The two wins proved
the Wolverines can beat almost
any team behind a defense that
showed its bright spots and an
aggressive offense that decides
to appear at the plate when it
needs to.
"When we're pitching to
contact and letting the defense
work, we're going to be pretty
good," said Michigan coach Erik
Bakich. "Our defense is pretty
good and fundamentally sound.
Combine that with clutch
hitting and that's post-season
baseball - pitching to contact,
making the routine plays and
getting timely hits.
"We'll be playing in June if we
can continue to do those things
at a high rate."
2. Defense is (nearly)
seamless.
In the three games against
Iowa (3-3, 15-9), Michigan made
only one error.
"We can play defense with
anyone," said junior center
fielder Jackson Glines.
With the fourth-best fielding
percentage in the Big Ten, the
Wolverines held the Hawkeves

to just two stolen bases despite
Iowa being the second-bestbase-
stealing team in the conference
- Michigan, though, is first.
Meanwhile, right fielder
JacksonLambpulledoffasecond
full-extension catch this season
in the ninth inning of Saturday's
4-2 win, earning the freshman
the limelight in SportsCenter's
Top 10.
"Defensively, we've shown
at times not only to make the
routine plays, but the highlight-
reel catches," Bakich said.
3. For Michigan, no lead is
safe.
Sunday, the Wolverines
learned this the hard way and it
almost cost them a win.
They jumped out to an early
1-0 lead, and later scored four
in the fifth inning. Then in the
eighth, junior left-hander Trent
Szkutnik exited after pitching
seven innings and allowing just
four hits,
During relief, senior right-
hander Alex 'L akatos' first
batter singled and he walked
the next. With no outs,
freshman right-hander Keith
Lehmann replaced Lakatos, but
even a second reliever couldn't
do much - he allowed a hit and
a walk to give the Hawkeyes
one run.
It took Michigan two more
pitchers to get out of an inning
that lasted 45 minutes and gave
Iowa five runs to tie the game.
The Wolverines retired the
ninth after five batters and
Glines' walk-off single ended the
game, but that didn't change the
fact that the bullpen has proven
anything can happen and a lead
is never safe.
"We didn't have the relief
pitching we wanted today,"
Bakich said. "Too many free
passes and uncompetitive
nitchers from our relievers"

4. The Wolverines are more
disciplined at the plate.
Just because they're
disciplined doesn't mean they're
afraid to hit, though.
Sunday, Michigan made
contact on the first two pitches
of the game. These batters
didn't get on base, but swinging
at the ball is exactly what the
Wolverines, ranked first in the
Big Ten for strikeouts, needed to
start doing.
Getting the bat on the ball is
dependent upon plate discipline,
something Michigan has
improved. The players swung
more aggressively, particularly at
the fastball, and even generated
some runs with two outs.
The Wolverines' at-bat
patience was best shown during
the fifth inning Sunday, when
they took five straight walks and
scored five runs.
But Bakich still thinks his team
cando abetterjoboflayingoffthe
breaking pitch in the dirt or the
off-speed pitch out of the zone,
and has given his players a simple
two-step approach at the plate,
"First, (we have to swing) at
good pitches early," Glines said.
"Second off, hold the zone."
5. Romano is out.
Friday, a runner stealing slid
into third baseman Ramsey
Romano'slefthand,breakingtwo
of the freshman's bones. Romano
was slow to get up to go to the
locker room, and later returned
to the dugout with a sling.
Sunday, Bakich predicted
Romano might be out six to eight
weeks, saying it's a situation
where he could be back for the
postseason or receive a medical
redshirt. Romano visited the
doctor Monday.
"It's going to have to be
determined if the bones will set
or if he needs a screw," Bakich
said.
