Thursday 
evening, 
the 

Defend 
Affirmative 
Action 

Party, eMerge and Movement, 
three of the four parties running 
for Central Student Government 
office, gathered in Hutchins 
Hall for the first presidential 
and vice presidential debate of 
the season.

Moderator 
Aaron 
Kall, 

the University of Michigan’s 
director 
of 
debate, 
asked 

candidates questions chosen 
from 
nearly 
100 
potential 

questions 
sent 
in 
online 

by 
University 
students. 

Presidential candidates were 
the first to take the floor.

The 
debate 
began 
with 

a 
question 
regarding 
the 

Leadership 
Engagement 

Scholarship and its $5 student 
fee discussed at a recent CSG 
meeting. 
While 
candidates 

did 
agree 
the 
scholarship 

itself is beneficial for students, 
LSA 
junior 
Evan 
Rosen, 

the 
Movement 
presidential 

candidate, 
emphasized 
the 

presence 
of 
bigger 
issues 

involving financial strains for 
students.

“The facts are that one in 

every five students that get 
accepted here don’t enroll at the 
University of Michigan because 
of financial reasons, and we 
were just ranked the number 
one least socioeconomic diverse 
public university in the nation,” 
he said. “It’s $5 here, but where 

does that end?”

Continuing with the theme 

of underrepresented students, 
candidates 
responded 
to 

a 
question 
regarding 
the 

University’s 
status 
as 
a 

sanctuary city, and whether or 
not they believe the University 
should be declared as such. All 
presidential 
candidates 
gave 

support 
for 
the 
University 

becoming a sanctuary city.

On the topic of improving 

campus 
climate, 
candidates 

each 
presented 
different 

approaches to advocating for 
underrepresented 
students 

and increasing awareness of 
diversity. LSA junior Anushka 
Sarkar, 
eMerge 
presidential 

candidate, gave four specific 
objectives she feels are crucial 
to improving campus climate.

The initiatives she listed 

included extending the Race 
and Ethnicity requirement to all 

colleges within the University, 
mandatory 
Intergroup 

Relations engagement for every 
incoming 
freshman, 
making 

the 
University 
a 
sanctuary 

campus and increasing minority 
enrollment.

“Rhetoric that implies that 

we have to go to Detroit to get 
students and to make sure they 
are qualified to apply to the 
University is condescending and 

About 35 people gathered 

on the steps of the Rackham 
Graduate 
School 
Thursday 

evening to hold a vigil for recent 
hate crimes — in particular, in 
remembrance of the murder 
of Indian immigrant Srinivas 
Kuchibhotla in Olathe, Kan.

Kuchibhotla was murdered in 

Kansas last month when a man 
named Adam Purinton shot him 
after supposedly yelling “get out 
of my country,” as reported in the 
New York Times. Purinton was 
apprehended and charged with 
premeditated murder.

Event co-organizer Brendan 

Wu, a University of Michigan 
alum, said they wanted to both 
commemorate 
Kuchibhotla, 

but also, more generally, bring 
attention to other victims of hate 
crimes in the United States.

“We wanted to mourn those 

deaths and, more broadly, we 
wanted to hold a vigil just to 
bring attention to victims of hate 
crimes, because they’ve been 
on the rise,” Wu said. “We just 
wanted to help unite people in 
their pain and build strength in

Michigan’s 
Teach-Out 

Series will be released online 
on March 31 and will focus on 
how countries transition from 
democratic

The format and name of the 

Teach-Out series were based on 
University’s tradition of teach-

the 1960s and have continued 
to the present. However, it will 
be distributed as an edX course. 
In an email interview, James

wrote the use of edX to promote 
the series is part of a goal to reach 
the largest audience possible.

“We hope to reach the broadest

The University of Michigan’s 

Dearborn campus hosted the 
year’s second Board of Regents 
Meeting on Thursday afternoon.

Central to the meeting were 

talks 
of 
renovations 
to 
the 

Michigan Union and divestment 
from Israel — a topic that was not 
on the agenda. All regents were in 
attendance except Regent Denise 
Ilitch (D), who phoned in.

Union renovations
The 
regents 
unanimously 

approved 
the 
estimated 

$85,200,000 budget proposal for 
the Michigan Union Renovation 
Project 
during 
the 
financial 

segment of the agenda. The 
construction project itself was 
approved at the July 2016 meeting.

Originally constructed in 1919, 

the Union has been a University 
landmark for many generations 
of students and faculty. The 
building’s 
infrastructural 

renovations include the general 

improvement of Union facilities, 
such as electrical and mechanical 
work, as well as architectural 
restoration.

Larger 
projects 
in 
design 

schematics involve the enclosure 
of the courtyard for a student 
space, improved accessibility for 
compliance with the Americans 
with 
Disabilities 
Act, 
the 

construction of gender-neutral 
bathrooms, new CAPS expansion 
and new student organization 
space. 

Charles Lewis, senior vice 

president of Integrated Design 
Solutions, the company being 
used for the planning of the 
renovations, 
presented 
a 

slideshow outlining the blueprints 
and graphics, showcasing what 
the new Union will look like after 
the renovations are completed in 
an estimated three years.

One 
component 
Lewis 

presented that received some 
questions from Regent Katherine 
White (D) and other regents was 
the physical renovation to the 
North Entrance, on the side of the 
Union. The current schematics

The words of Nigerian author

“nobody is ever just a refugee,

with opportunities for working

Over 
100 
students

inside the University of Michigan

to listen as former refugees shared 
their stories of resettlement, 
and professionals in the refugee

their

“What We Carried” was based 

on the collaborative storytelling 
project 
of 
photographer 
Jim 

Lommasson, 
who 
sought 
to 

preserve the identities of displaced 
Syrian and Iraqi refugees through 
the objects they chose to bring 
from their destroyed homes.

Lommasson said he began 

his project after an Iraqi woman 
living in Portland asked him, 
“I thank America for removing 
Saddam Hussein, but did you 
have to destroy my entire country 
to do that?” From there, the 
photographer began to capture 
images of the personal items 

refugees took from their homes in 
order to tell a story.

Lommasson noted that, though 

people often point to photography 
as an attempt to humanize its 
subjects, it is not the refugees who 
need to be humanized.

“The things that I photograph 

were sometimes kind of exotic, as 
we would expect, but sometimes 
there were Barbie dolls, things 
that we wouldn’t expect, but it 
sends a message that we’re all 
alive,” he said. “You don’t need 
to be humanized, you’re already

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Two 
student 
groups 
from 

the University of Michigan Law 
School, the Michigan Health Law 
Organization and the Law School 
Democrats, hosted a talk Thursday 
morning concerning the repeal of 
former President Barack Obama’s 
health care law, the Affordable 
Care Act, and its replacement, the 
American Health Care Act.

The panel, which included Public 

Health Prof. Marianne Udow-
Phillips, Terry Campbell, regional 
manager of Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s 
office, and multiple law students, 
addressed the impact the ACA has 
had on them personally and on 
the United States, as well as what 
the new American Health Care 
Act legislated under the President 
Donald Trump’s administration 
will mean for people previously 
covered by the ACA.

The discussion began with 

Udow-Phillips 
explaining 
the 

groundwork of the Affordable Care 
Act. She emphasized the centrality 
of Obama’s push for coverage.

“Health care is a social good, 

and should, in fact, be provided by 
government in some way, shape or 
form,” she said.

Still, for decades, presidents 

current and former have struggled 
with the issue of how health care 
should be provided.

Udow-Phillips 
stated 
there 

are essentially only two ways to 
accomplish 
universal 
coverage: 

a national service or tax system, 
such as Medicare or Medicaid, or 
an employment-based system or 
mandate. The ACA, she said, is a 
combination of the two.

There is difficulty not only in 

creating, but also in overcoming the 
technical issues of implementing 
it effectively. According to Udow-
Phillips, when former President Bill 

Clinton’s health care plan was first 
drafted, Republicans were opposed 
to having everyone pay into the 
health insurance system because 
they might not directly be paying 
for themselves. This is something 
Udow-Phillips opposed.

“If everybody just paid a little 

bit into the system, then we could 
pay for the people who are sick at 
that moment.” Phillips said. “Then, 
when those healthy people get sick, 
those other dollars are there to pay 
for them. That is the fundamental 
principle of insurance.”

The talk continued with an 

explanation of what the Affordable 
Care Act accomplished. According 
to Phillips, though Democrats 
were against the idea of the 
responsibility for insurance being 
left to the individual, they agreed it 
might be a start to a comprehensive 
and bipartisan health care plan 
in coming years. “Obamacare,” 
she explained, aimed to expand 
Medicaid coverage to as many 
people as possible, as well as lower 
the cost of individual insurance.

Since the implementation of the 

ACA, Phillips said, Congressional 
Republicans have stuck with the 
idea of “repeal and replace.” And 
until Trump was elected to the 
presidency, it seemed that this 
wasn’t a likely possibility.

Now, with the creation of 

the ACHA, many Americans 
are at risk of losing their health 
coverage. 
The 
ACA 
offered 

tax credits based on income to 
provide those with lower income 
access to health care. The ACHA 
shifts credits from being based 
on income to age, and the elderly, 
low-income people and people 
with pre-existing conditions face 
the possibility of no longer having 
easily accessible health insurance.

During the talk, Campbell 

expressed concern that those 
covered under the ACA will 
become vulnerable to increased 
costs under the ACHA.

with the help of our colleagues 
at the U-M Alumni Association, 
along 
with 
other 
channels. 

Our 
(massive 
online 
open 

courses) have reached over 5.6M 
enrollments over the last 5 years 
so we also hope to encourage 
many of these learners to 
explore these topics with us.”

Natural Resources Prof. Arun 

Agrawal, an expert in political 
science, will be hosting the first 
teach-out event. Agrawal said 
the transition to authoritarian 
rule is a prevalent topic in the 
media and he believes many 

can benefit from having a better 
understanding 
of 
how 
this 

transition functions.

“I think what is really important 

for us to understand better at this 
point is how democratic countries 
can become more authoritarian or 
countries that are more democratic 
can become more authoritarian,” 
Agrawal said. “This is important 
both because of the way many 
issues are being portrayed in the 
news media and because of the 
concern that many people have 
about the extent to which that an 
erosion in both democratic values 
and democratic decision making, 
and I’m not talking just about the 
United States — I think it is going 
on lots of countries.”

According to Agrawal, since 

the 1980s, there has been a 
general trend toward democracy 
in political systems in areas such 
as Africa and Latin America. 
However, he said in recent years 
there has been a growing concern 
about a global shift away from 
democracy in many countries, 
so he and other faculty members 
participating in the teach-outs 
will draw on historical examples 
of countries that moved from 
democracy to authoritarianism 
and 
relate 
them 
to 
current 

political climates around the 
globe.

plan replaces the brick awning 
over the entrance with a glass 
canopy, allowing more light to 
reach the entrance. White was 
concerned 
about 
specifics 
of 

this renovation. Lewis said this 
modification would give a better 
aesthetic impression.

“The North entry is the most 

heavily used entrance of the 
Union, in some ways, it’s a front 

door to the University for visitors, 
students, staff, faculty, alumni and 
currently is very dark, hard to find 
and not very welcoming,” White 
said. “This canopy will create a 
more appropriate and inviting 
entry for everyone to come and 
enjoy the renewed place we call 
the Michigan Union.”

Prior 
to 
the 
presentation, 

University alum Alan Knaus, 
a member of Friends of the 
Michigan Union, expressed his 
dissatisfaction with the renovation 
of certain spaces in the Union for 
student activities. He said the 

renovation catered to students 
over 
alumni, 
and 
eliminated 

elements of the Union he loves, 
such as the Billiards Room.

“I was not happy with (the 

elimination of the Billiards Room) 
and the alumni that were there were 
also not very happy about that,” he 
said. “From my perspective, the 
Office of Student Life does not 
belong in the Michigan Union. 
Essentially it’s supporting 1,400 
special interest groups.”

State Rep. Stephanie Chang 

(D–Detroit) could not be at 
the event, but sent a statement 
to event organizers that was 
read at the event, saying she 
stands in solidarity with all 
immigrants 
and 
minorities 

facing harassment or attack.

“While I cannot be here 

tonight, my thoughts are with 
you, as well as with the families 
who have been affected by 
hate crimes,” Chang said in the 

statement. 
“Immigrants 
and 

others, today more than ever, are 
harassed attacked and murdered 
with horrifying frequency.”

During the vigil, attendees — 

particularly those of South Asian 
descent — were also invited to 
share personal experiences or 
general thoughts on their own 
communities.

Business

Chelsea 

Racelis, a co-organizer of the

on what people in their own 
communities may be facing, but 
also strive to understand others 
and get further involved.

“I hope people reflect on 

what this means for their own 
communities,” 
Racelis 
said. 

“There is a reason why everyone 
came here today.”

Racelis also said she hopes 

people continue to go out and 
engage with different people and 
events around campus to learn 
more and stand in solidarity 
with others.

“I hope people leave with not a 

filled cup, but the desire to fill their 
cup,” Racelis said. “To not just 
come here and say ‘oh look this is 
so great, I went to this vigil and 
learned so much.’ I want people to 
take people and say ‘these are the 
experiences I heard and I want to 
hear more experiences.’ ”

that. It’s probably people like 
Donald Trump who need to be 
humanized, it’s not you.”

The stories of the refugees, 

all told through the help of a 
translator 
onstage, 
were 
all 

united by common threads of 
shared humanity, desire to help 
others and a love for American 
democracy.

Omar, who did not provide 

his last name as he was an 
Iraqi refugee, said he came to 
Michigan in 2014 with his wife 
and two sons. Once he settled, 
he began learning English online 
and applying for jobs. He noted 
how hard it was to start from a 
place less than zero, and how 
easy it is for people to forget they 
share humanity with people from 
different cultures.

“I am a person just like you and 

we are all from one humankind, 
and I want to live somewhere safe 

and secure,” Omar said. “Arabs 
and Iraqis also have culture and 
customs, like Americans … We are 
human.”

Another speaker, Shihab, who 

also did not provide his last name 
due to his immigration status, 
detailed the horrors that refugees 
encounter in Arab countries such 
as Egypt, then expressed his deep 
love and admiration for the United 
States. He said he hopes his voice 
will reach people across the world, 
and that he can start a new life 
replete with happiness and safety 
in America.

“We 
as 
Muslims, 
and 

specifically refugees, really love 
all of you guys,” Shihab said. 
“Especially as refugees looking 
for a safe place to live to live in 
safety and freedom, because we 
were denied that right in our own 
home countries. We wanted to 
come to America to live, to live in 
happiness and safety and freedom. 
To live in democracy and justice. 
To build a future for our kids, and 
to teach them knowledge and good 
manners. Oh people, I ask you to 

help me. So that my small voice, 
me and my brother, will reach the 
rest of the world.”

At the end of his talk, Shihab 

read aloud a small portion of 
a letter he wrote to President 
Donald Trump. In the letter, he 
asked the president to provide 
refugees with a safe place to live, 
and said refugees respect his 
leadership and policies.

“For the sake of refugees, please 

help us, please help us, Mr. Trump,” 
he said. “Look carefully in your 
future plans. We deserve and we 
need to live in a safe place and we 
respect your policies and your 
orders, and respect your fear for 
the American people — because 
America is more important than 
anything.”

Students in attendance said 

hearing the refugees’ stories made 
them consider their privilege, and 
how immigrants can become part 
of U.S. society today.

it’s racist,” Sarkar said. “Students 
are already qualified to be here. 
The problem is that they don’t 
want to be here.”

Later in the debate, candidates 

were asked about their ideal 
commencement speaker, a repeat 
question from one of last year’s 
debates, allowing them to get 
a little more creative. Rosen 
advocated for Donald Glover, 
commonly known by his stage 
name Childish Gambino, because 
of the performer’s determination, 
drive and ability to entertain a 
crowd accustomed to the typical 
seriousness of commencement 
speeches; Sarkar chose Beyoncé, 
someone she has been pushing for 
as a speaker since her freshman 
year, because of her empowering 
aspects, 
specifically 
when 

showing it is possible for a woman 

to maintain a successful career, 
family and social balance, a 
balance Beyoncé built for herself; 
Art & Design senior Keysha Wall, 
the DAAP presidential candidate, 
said they would like to see Angela 
Davis, a political activist and 
someone Wall continues to learn 
about, address students.

In another question regarding 

the drinking culture on campus, 
Wall 
highlighted 
alcohol’s 

common 
association 
with 

sexual assault and discussed 
the importance of disciplining 
those accused of rape and sexual 
assault. According to a 2007 
National Institute Justice report, 
89 percent of incapacitated sexual 
assault victims reported having 
consumed alcohol.

“I know that one of the 

problems when our campus gets 
to drinking, or when alcohol 
is involved, is the issue of rape 
and sexual assault,” they said. “I 
would say that, even bigger than 
that, we can prevent people from 

even being hurt by exposing and 
expelling rapists from campus.”

Candidates 
followed 
with 

closing 
statements, 
each 

expressing 
their 
dedication 

to CSG and what their parties 
mean to them. Vice presidential 
candidates then came forward to 
debate.

The status of the University 

as a sanctuary city was again 
brought forward in this round of 
questioning, and candidates were 
asked whether or not they were 
concerned the University could 
lose federal funding if it were to 
declare this status or if it were to 
bring in controversial speakers.

LSA senior Lauren Kay, vice 

presidential candidate for DAAP, 
described issues they see with the 
discussion of such topics solely 
in terms of financial standpoints, 
as well as issues regarding the 
privatization of higher education.

A

s we drove down Carpenter 
Street in the Binghampton 
neighborhood of Memphis, 

Tenn., 
schoolchildren 

in royal purple polos 
and khakis flooded the 
sidewalk as school let 
out for the day. Their 
backpacks 
bounced 

on their backs as they 
crossed the street to the 
Carpenter Art Garden, 
a lively purple house 
with a yard full of large, 
painted, wooden hearts. 
Our tour guide, Noah 
Gray, the executive director 
of the Binghampton Development 
Corporation, explained they were 
part of a Valentine’s Day craft. The 
same hearts were speckled around 
the neighborhood, the children’s 
colorful masterpieces proudly on 
display in nearly every yard down 
the street. It was the picture of 
a loving, vibrant community. 
Though poverty levels and crime 
rates in Binghampton remain 
high, it was hard to believe people 
avoided even driving through it 
about a decade ago. 

Over Spring Break, six students 

and I visited Memphis with a 
global health and design student 
organization 
called 
Michigan 

Health Engineered for All Lives to 
serve the city — a destination that my 
mother constantly worried about. 
All she knew was that Memphis 
ranks as one of the most dangerous 
cities in the United States, and 
that statistic was enough for her to 
imagine a blighted, desolate ghetto. 
She’s not alone in this thinking. 
Media and statistics have framed 
Memphis — and similar cities of 
highly concentrated poverty and 
racial minorities, such as Detroit 
— as dangerous, drug-ridden and 
to be avoided. It was a perception 
that I, admittedly, shared before 
a week in the city showed me just 
how inaccurate and unfair the 
stigmas attached to Memphis are. 
In seven short days, my impressions 
of 
Memphis 
were 
completely 

transformed.

One of the goals of Serve901, an 

organization we worked with in 
Memphis, is to educate outsiders on 
the history of Memphis and to erase 
the negative stigmas attached to the 
city, and they surely did just that. 
We learned from many residents 
that Memphis was once primed 
to be the “New York City of the 
South” until yellow fever struck and 
wealthy, white residents fled to the 
suburbs, leaving behind a population 
that was predominantly poor and 
Black. Institutionalized segregation, 
perpetuated by years of systemic 
racism, 
further 
concentrated 

African Americans in certain 
impoverished 
neighborhoods, 

such as Binghampton and Orange 
Mound. Needless to say, Memphis 
did not become the Big Apple of 
the South and instead garnered 
a reputation as a city falling apart 
at the seams.

However, what the statistics 

and media fail to show is all the 
wonderful change that is happening 
in Memphis.

One of the largest problems 

in Memphis is food scarcity, a 
phenomenon in which people living 
in an area do not have regular access 

to healthy food, either because they 
cannot afford it or because grocery 
stores are too far away and there are 

no transit options, such 
as bus lines or access 
to cars. For example, 
the historic Orange 
Mound neighborhood 
of Memphis is a USDA-
classified urban food 
desert, because most of 
its residents do not own 
cars and often have to 
choose between paying 
rent and buying food. 

Recognizing 
this 

serious problem in his 

community, resident Mike Minnis, 
whose wife was born and raised in 
Orange Mound, started Landmark 
Farmers Market, an urban farming 
operation and food kitchen in the 
middle of the neighborhood. Now, 
residents of Orange Mound can 
access affordable, healthy, fresh-
grown fruits and vegetables only a 
short walk away. Minnis’s efforts 
have even inspired others in the 
neighborhood to start their own 
gardens and take control of their 
own health.

And it doesn’t stop there. With 

intimate knowledge about the 
exchange of information within 
the families of the community, 
Minnis plans to educate his 
neighborhood on nutrition and 
health education by way of 
children’s comic books. Through 
these simple yet genuine actions, 
he is stirring tangible change in 
the roots of his community.

The Binghampton Development 

Corporation is another organization 
that aims to combat food scarcity in 
the Binghampton neighborhood. 
Although Gray did not grow up 
in Binghampton and thus hasn’t 
experienced its problems firsthand, 
he makes it a priority to engage 
members of the community in 
the BDC’s efforts by hiring them 
or listening to their personal 
testimonials. For example, after 
consulting 
with 
residents 
of 

Binghampton and discovering they 
have to take multiple buses to get 
to the nearest Kroger for groceries 
— a trip that can take several hours 
— the BDC began development 
of a new plaza in the heart of the 
neighborhood. When it is complete, 
no resident will live more than a mile 
away from a grocery store.

The BDC has also reshaped the 

community in other substantial 
ways, such as building parks in 
abandoned 
lots, 
converting 
a 

rundown apartment complex into 
a senior living center and opening 
the Carpenter Art Garden. The Art 
Garden houses a number of after-
school activities and clubs, allowing 
the children of Binghampton to 
discover 
artistic, 
engineering, 

carpentry, sewing, writing and 
entrepreneurial skills that might’ve 
otherwise 
gone 
untapped. 
By 

listening to and engaging with 
the community — rather than 
coming in and assuming they 
know best, as many “saviors” 
of blighted neighborhoods do — 
the BDC is proof that positive 
change can happen quickly 
when people are passionate 
about their communities.

BDC 
Boardmember 
Robert 

Montague is another figure who 

has used his privilege for the 
betterment of those not as fortunate. 
Once a successful businessman 
and computing analyst, Montague 
used his money and expertise to 
found the BDC. His latest endeavor, 
Tech901, aims to confront the 
shortage of IT talent in Memphis, 
as well as the lack of diversity in the 
field. By teaching young Memphians 
how to code and equipping them 
with 
professional 
development 

skills, Tech901 is making the future 
of Memphis marketable. It would 
be easy to make lots of money by 
teaching programming classes in the 
richer suburbs of Memphis, but by 
investing in people in the inner city, 
Tech901 is investing in its future.

Landmark 
Farmers 
Market, 

the BDC and Tech901 are only 
a handful of all the wonderful 
organizations that are dedicated 
to improving different aspects of 
Memphis, and the more I saw, the 
more I realized how mistaken my 
initial impressions of the city were. 
With the work of these community 
organizers, Memphis is proving 
its negative reputation wrong — 
proving me wrong.

Many University of Michigan 

students come from a place of 
privilege and may feel far removed 
from the problems in Memphis — or 
even in Detroit, a mere 40 minutes 
away — but as the people at the BDC 
and Tech901 have demonstrated, 
that is no excuse to ignore and avoid 
the very real problems that are 
happening. These organizations 
recognized the problems within 
these communities and made real 
improvements by working with the 
people living there. As University 
students, we, too, can use our 
privilege for good. Our education 
has afforded us knowledge, skills 
and resources that would be well-
spent helping a population that 
doesn’t have the same privileges.

And we don’t have to wait 

until 
graduation 
to 
start 

making a positive impact; even 
as undergraduates, there are 
a number of resources at our 
fingertips. M-HEAL is just one 
fine example. Devoted to global 
health, M-HEAL project teams 
reach out to contacts in developing 
countries to identify health needs 
in those regions and design 
solutions to the problem using all 
the resources this University has to 
offer. Through this design process, 
we gain valuable experience in 
engineering and global health, but 
the focus of these projects is always 
on the people we are hoping to 
help. Through constant contact, 
research and needs assessment 
trips, we make sure we are always 
catering to their needs, requests 
and wishes, because when you’re 
helping a city or country in 
need, it’s really about helping 
the people there.

As we finished our tour 

of Binghampton, Gray said of 
Memphians: “We do not love 
Memphis 
because 
it’s 
great; 

Memphis is great because we love 
it.” That love is so evident in all the 
wonderful work they do, and it is 
truly something to learn from and 
aspire toward.

M

y friends know me to be 
an inconsistent texter 
at best, and I readily 

admit that it’s not my 
forte. The optimal way 
to reach me is as simple 
as it is surprisingly 
intimate: call.

I’ve always loved 

phone calls. When I was 
younger, I memorized 
my home number — 
along with those of my 
grandparents and my 
great-grandmother 
(Gammy). Every night, 
I’d sit in our small breakfast nook, 
pick up the landline and chat with 
Gammy. It was meaningful time.

I can’t recall what we talked 

about, but I remember viscerally 
that it brought me a great deal of joy. 
I liked hearing her voice and having 
a real conversation. My Gammy has 
long since passed, but my impulse 
to engage with others not directly 
in my presence via phone has 
persisted throughout my life.

When I was allowed to get an 

AOL Instant Messager account, for 
example, I always insisted on video 
chatting with friends. It made the 
interaction even more personal to 
see whom I was talking with and 
feel like their whole presence (as 
opposed to just their voice) was 
there in the room.

It’s why I love FaceTime so 

much now. For those of you who 
watch “Broad City,” FaceTime is 
an integral part of the show. Its 
main characters, Abbi and Ilana, 
FaceTime each other no matter 
the context. FaceTime feeds their 
impulse to speak to one another 
whenever they’re not together (and 
sometimes, even when they are), 
whether it’s from the street or a cab 
or the bathroom.

I 
asked 
Nansook 
Park, 
a 

University of Michigan psychology 
professor 
who 
specializes 
in 

personality and social contexts, 
whether or not my tendency toward 
phone calls and FaceTiming is 
rooted deeper than individual 
preference, and she explained 

that “human beings are social 
animals” for whom interpersonal 
communication is as necessary as 

food and water.

“Even 
with 

emoticons, 
texting 

is limited in terms 
of conveying deeper 
and intimate feelings 
and subtle nuanced 
messages,” she wrote in 
an email. “We can pick 
up a lot more subtle but 
significant 
messages 

about the other person 
through different tone 

of voices and facial expressions. 
Through body languages, we can 
communicate … (a) variety of subtle 
messages that is not always easy to 
convey in written words.”

The more extensive sensory 

experience of voice-to-voice and 
face-to-face communication, Park 
noted, “can make people feel closer 
to one another.” Sounds right to me. 
You can’t “ghost” someone when 
they’re listening live on the other 
end of the line. A phone call is an 
investment: of time, of substance 
and perhaps of emotion, to some 
extent. Answering a phone call is 
as active as making one; it means 
that both parties actually want to 
be part of it (for the most part). It’s 
not a coincidence that I associate 
phone calls with the strongest 
relationships in my life.

Phone calls are how I check 

in with my parents throughout 
the week, and how I catch up 
with my grandparents (albeit a 
little less frequently). My sister 
and I sometimes FaceTime in 
silence while we do homework, 
intermittently 
exchanging 

BuzzFeed quizzes and comparing 
our results when we need a break. 
It’s about the company, you know?

When I FaceTime non-college 

buddies, it’s as much about talking 
as it is about seeing what the other 
person’s environment is and how 
they occupy that space. What is 
their normal? Their routine? What 
does it look like? Sound like? How 
is it different from (or the same as) 

the space in which we interacted 
in the past? Video chatting is so 
special because physical separation 
is bridged by literally bringing 
another human being into my lived 
experience (and vice versa).

And when folks aren’t around 

to pick up the phone (or when I’m 
not, for that matter), I’m thankful 
for the documentary nature of 
voicemail. Some people don’t listen 
to voicemail, but I treasure it. My 
mailbox is frequently full — in 
part out of laziness, sure, but also 
because I save certain messages 
and re-listen to them.

Some are for laughs, like this 

favorite from my sister: “Hello. 
It’s me. Mom and Dad are being 
weird again. Okay. Bye.” Others 
have a deeper meaning. Last 
January, while I was on the East 
Coast as part of the Michigan 
in 
Washington 
program, 
a 

monumental blizzard hit D.C. one 
weekend. I still have the voicemail 
saved from my dad’s father, who 
called to ask me about it. He died 
over the summer, and every once 
in a while, it’s nice to pull up that 
message and hear his voice.

To 
be 
certain, 
text 

conversations serve a purpose, 
and they’re not to be avoided. 
Some of my funniest and most 
memorable exchanges have been 
via text, particularly in places 
where speaking aloud would be 
rude, frowned upon or altogether 
unacceptable. 
But 
voice 
is 

powerful, and even more so when 
it’s accompanied by visage. It’s 
not a coincidence that I ran this 
column by both my mother and a 
high school friend via FaceTime 
before I finished writing it.

Now that I’m graduating, I’m 

cognizant of the fact that my 
college friends will be added to 
the list of people who are spread 
across parts of the country 
where I am not. So a heads-up: 
expect frequent FaceTime calls 
from this guy.

R

ecently, a student-written 
article titled “My Child 
Will Not Be Allowed to Be 

Transgender” has been popping 
up on my social media. From one 
student to another, here’s my 
response:

Moriah,
This is about to be a critical 

response, but I want to level with 
you first. I admire your desire 
to do the best for your future 
children. I do. As someone who 
works in a family psychological 
clinic, I love seeing people who 
want to do the right thing for 
their children — who want to sing 
to them, care for them and make 
them happy. I have no doubt that 
you will love your children.

But here’s the thing that most 

people don’t want to acknowledge: 
From those who do all the “right” 
things to those who commit abuse 
or neglect, a vast majority of parents 
love their children. Loving your 
children does not mean that you 
cannot, or will not, hurt them. So, I 
ask you to be vigilant in evaluating 
your behavior; do not fall into 
the trap of believing that doing 
something out of love means that it 
is the best thing to do for your child.

With that said, let’s get into it.
I want to believe you truly love 

and respect transgender and other 
LGBTQ people as you say you do, 
but after reading your article, I find 
it hard to do so. This is the message 
that your article gives off: I love you 
and respect you, but your existence 
is invalid. I love you and respect 
you, but you are a flawed human 
being. I love you and respect you, 
but you are sick. I love you and 
respect you, but you cannot be who 
you are unless it is in a way that I 
deem acceptable.

That’s not how love and respect 

work. You cannot say you respect 
someone 
and 
then 
invalidate 

their existence and trivialize their 
identity to a simple “decision.” 
And what message does it send 
to say I love you, but I would not 
let someone who is “closest to my 
heart” be like you?

After 
reading 
your 
article, 

I gather that you have two 
main 
concerns: 
that 
being 

transgender is against how God 
intended us to be, and that being 
transgender is a mental illness. 
So, let’s talk about that.

“My children will always be the 

ones closest to my heart, but this 
does not mean that I will accept 

their desire to be anything other 
than who God made them as.” 

Let me ask you a question: How 

does one know what God intended 
for them? Growing up Catholic, 
I was taught that the Bible offers 
insight into God’s will. In the 
absence of an actual scriptural 
reference, many religious people, 
yourself included, argue that God 
created man and woman and that 
being transgender is wrong because 
transgender people go against God’s 
will by straying from that design. I 
don’t buy that argument — mostly 
because it reveals a misconception 
of what it means to be transgender 
in that it conflates identifying as 
transgender with receiving gender 
reassignment surgery.

Being transgender does not 

mean that you will change your 
biological sex; it just means that 
you don’t identify with it. While 
many people choose to have 
gender reassignment surgery in 
order to make their physical state 
match their mental state, not all 
transgender people do. Whether 
they choose not to have surgery 
because 
of 
financial 
reasons, 

age, lack of resources or simply 
because they don’t feel a need to, 
they are still transgender as long 
as they experience a disconnect 
between their biological sex and 
their identified gender. It is 
problematic, then, to argue that 
being transgender is against 
God’s will using a biologically 
based 
argument, 
because 
it 

doesn’t reflect the reality of what 
it means to be transgender.

It’s also important to note that if 

we are basing gender on genitalia, 
then it isn’t true that God only 
created man and woman because 
God also created intersex people, 
who were born with ambiguous 
genitalia. Many people who are 
born intersex have a surgery 
performed upon them, in which a 
doctor changes their genitalia to 
look more like a penis or a vagina. If 
you are strongly opposed to surgery 
that changes one’s genitals (like 
gender reassignment surgery), then 
you should probably be open to a 
third gender — or else you would 
have to allow intersex people to 
choose whether to be a man or 
woman regardless of the genitals 
they were born with.

So perhaps God’s design isn’t all 

that clear cut, Moriah. But even if 
it isn’t ungodly to be transgender, 
could you still be right that being 

transgender means that you are 
inherently sick or mentally ill? 
Not quite.

“In my opinion, transgender 

humans are suffering from a 
mental illness, in a similar fashion 
to those fighting sicknesses such as 
anorexia and depression.”

Disorders like anorexia nervosa 

and depression are described in 
the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual, the manual clinicians 
use to diagnose and treat their 
patients. Transgenderism is not 
described here. To equate being 
transgender to having a mental 
illness is a dangerous comparison 
to make. We used to make 
this comparison in regards to 
homosexuality until the American 
Psychological Association — with 
the help of some tenacious activists 
— realized how detrimental it is to 
pathologize homosexuality.

To be fair, I could see how you 

might be confused. A concept that 
is related to being transgender 
is in the DSM-5 under “gender 
dysphoria,” which is described as 
distress resulting from “a conflict 
between a person’s physical or 
assigned gender and the gender 
with which he/she/they identify.” 
But gender dysphoria is not an 
identity, and it is not an inevitability.

Praying that your child will 

suddenly feel like their penis or 
vagina fits with their body isn’t 
going to make gender dysphoria 
go away. Taking your child to 
conversion therapy that will try to 
make them “accept” their biological 
sex isn’t going to work either — in 
fact, it can make it worse. There 
are reasons why some states 
have made conversion therapy 
illegal and why the American 
Psychological Association does not 
support it: It can lead to higher rates 
of depression, anxiety, drug use 
and homelessness. Scariest of all? 
Conversion therapy is correlated 
with a higher number of suicide 
attempts and completions. So 
perhaps we should be focused 
on making conversion therapy 
illegal if we want what’s best for 
LGBTQ youth. 

By the way, do you know 

what 
is 
recommended 
for 

people with gender dysphoria? 

My child can be transgender

This 
Friday 
and 

Saturday, UMS will present 
Betroffenheit, a performance 
that 
combines 
theatre 
and 

dance to tell a grippingly 
honest story of trauma, loss 
and 
addiction. 
With 
five 

contemporary dancers and a 
single protagonist, Kidd Pivot 
and Electric Company Theatre 
come together to create a 

project that mixes spoken word, 
recorded text and movement.

Betroffenheit is a German 

word that does not have an 
exact English translation, but 
it describes a state of extreme 
shock after an event. Due to the 
subject of this piece, it is not 
recommended for children.

Jonathan Young, cofounder 

and artistic director of Electric 
Company Theatre, has a large 
background in acting and is 
best known for his role of 
Nikola Tesla in Sanctuary. He 
started writing Betroffenheit 
in 2014 in collaboration with 
choreographer 
Crystal 
Pite, 

artistic director of the dance 
company Kidd Pivot.

“[Betroffenheit 
sits] 

somewhere between a piece 
of live theatre and a piece of 
contemporary dance,” Young 
said in an interview.

Betroffenheit 
takes 
place 

in the wake of a trauma, 
an 
accident 
that 
occurred 

sometime in the past of the 
male protagonist played by 
Jonathan Young. The narrative 
is about the recovery process, 
as he struggles to deal with 
what he has gone through.

“Voices seem to be attached 

to the fixtures, and the lights, 
and the walls and the doors,” 
Young said. “Audiences get the 
sense that the whole stage in a 
way has been affected by this 
accident and (the protagonist 
is) also, as it turns 
out, 
addicted 

to some kind of 
substance 
that 

he’s 
been 
using 

for relief from this 
trauma.” 

The inspiration 

behind 
the 

project 
stems 

from Young’s own 
personal traumatic 
experiences 
with 

the death of his 
daughter and two 
cousins in a fire.

“You 
don’t 

really have much 
choice but to put 
(that trauma) into words, in an 
attempt to express that because 
it’s on your mind all the time,” 
said Young about his project.

Instead of processing his 

own traumatic events privately, 
Young chose to share this 
experience with others through 
Betroffenheit.

“We 
kind 
of 
have 
a 

responsibility 
as 
artists 
I 

think to turn stuff that feels 
like it can’t be expressed into 
expression,” he said.

Though inspired by real 

events, Betroffenheit aims for 
balance between personal and 
universal experiences. The goal 
is for people to see themselves 
in the performance and for the 
piece to invoke compassion, 
empathy, fear and sadness. 
Young also recognizes that 
there is a considerable taboo 
surrounding this subject, and he 
wishes to erase the sensitivity 
that surrounds events such as 
death. People who have gone 
through a similar traumatic 
event will likely be able to 

relate well to the piece. 

“(Most people) are grateful 

for having seen it because it 
reminds them that they are not 
alone,” Young said.

But, 
surprisingly 
enough, 

humor plays an active role in 
Betroffenheit.

“Humor has a life force that 

is irrepressible. No matter how 
difficult things get in life, humor 
has a way of surviving and 
surprising, and mischief is a real 
driving force in creativity” Young 
said. Combining that which 

is 
traumatic 

and that which 
is 
amusing 

is 
something 

unique 
to 
the 

capabilities 
of 

human nature.

With so many 

layers, 
this 
is 

the type of show 
that 
should 

be 
seen 
more 

than 
once, 
in 

which 
audience 

members 
are 

sure to witness 
things that they 
missed the first 
time.

“I hope people will want to see 

it again ... I’m just going to leave 
it at that,” Young concluded.

Currently, Young and Pite are 

working on another dance and 

theatre hybrid with Nederlands 
Dans Theater that takes the 
ideas of Betroffenheit a little 
further and is projected to be 
ready by 2019.

On Max Richter’s ‘Sleep’

It’s quiet here.
Outside, 
in 
the 
frigid 

darkness, nothing moves. No 
birds sing, no deer wander, 
no headlights cut through the 
clear air. Even the wind seems 
to be hushed. Somewhere over 
the trees the moon silently 
hangs 
suspended 
above 

the wisps of cloud. In the 
apartment around me, each 
of its inhabitants respire in 
steady, relaxed tempos. The 
world is sleeping.

It’s 5:19 a.m. and everything 

is still.

For the past several hours, 

essentially all night, I have 
been 
immersed 
in 
Max 

Richter’s composition “Sleep.” 
Listening to this piece is like 
a sort of trance — once you 
enter into it, you stop noticing 
it’s there. The music gradually 
melds 
into 
the 
scenery, 

fades into the background of 
whatever you are doing and 
enters into you. It isn’t so much 
doing anything as it is simply 
being: being present, being 
absent, 
being 
everywhere 

and nowhere at once. 
Its 

principal characteristic is its 
inexplicable, elusive feeling 
of 
grounded 
placelessness. 

It invites you into its care 
and envelops your tired mind 
in a soft embrace. It hovers 
at 
the 
periphery 
of 
your 

senses. “Sleep” doesn’t ask for 
anything from you. It doesn’t 
demand your attention or your 
love or your hate, or even your 
recognition. It goes on whether 
you’re listening or not. To try 
to analyze it would be beside 
the point.

“Sleep” is a few years old 

now, but to me it still feels 
relevant. I won’t say that it’s 
fresh — applying such an 
adjective to music which is so 
simple, constructed with such 
an economy of means, would 
be unjust — but it isn’t dated, 
and the ideas that Richter put 
into the piece might even be 
more important today than 
they were when it was first 
composed. The entirety of 
“Sleep” is slow, unelaborate 
music scored for piano, strings, 
voice and electronics. There 
are no words. There is no 
drama. The piece lasts for 
eight hours, moving along at 

a gradual, unhurried pace. 
It is composed to last the 
average amount of time that 
it takes the human brain to 
complete a healthy night of 
sleep. In Richter’s words, it is a 
“personal lullaby for a frenetic 
world. A manifesto for a slower 
pace of existence.”

But as far as manifestos 

go, it’s rather innocuous. It’s 
difficult to say what it feels 
like to listen to “Sleep.” It has a 
certain quality of timelessness 
(in the sense of time being 
stopped) and displacement, but 
there’s more to it than that. Lost 
in its soundworld, I can’t seem 
to shake the feeling that I’m 
walking on some distant lunar 
surface, wandering in an alien 
landscape. There is at once an 
otherness and an intimacy with 

the self. In the wide sonorities 
of the piano and the strings, 
Richter leaves space for the 
listener’s thoughts to roam 
freely. Suggestive of nothing, 
it opens up distances to fill 
with your own expression. 
Creation and form at your 
fingertips, godlike, you can 
mentally wander through the 
music in search of whatever it 
is you need to find. But more 
than anything, when you listen 
to “Sleep,” you feel somehow 
totally alone.

In this respect, the piece is 

like the act of sleeping itself. 
Slumber is by its nature a 
solitary act, and even those 
of us who share a bed with 
someone else must eventually 
cross 
the 
threshold 
into 

the 
dreamworld 
alone. 
As 

with sleep’s inevitable and 
permanent cousin, each of us 
must sail into the undiscovered 
country on a solitary voyage, 
with 
neither 
maps 
nor 

guidance.

Heavily 
influenced 
by 

minimalism, 
the 
textures 

and ideas of “Sleep” are very 
simple. For minutes on end the 

cello may play a single pitch 
while the piano slowly cycles 
through chords in an even 
rhythm. The violin may play 
all of two pitches for an entire 
movement. An elegiac voice 
melody may played on loop 
until it ceases to be noticed.

Richter, 
a 
German-born 

British 
composer, 
is 
no 

neophyte to these minimalist 
techniques. For over a decade 
he 
has 
been 
making 
an 

impression as a composer who 
isn’t afraid to apply the tenets 
of the minimalist movement 
to genres outside of classical. 
He is known for his work in 
collaborative projects, as well 
as for performing and for 
his film scores. His minimal 
aesthetic makes him accessible 
to 
both 
regular 
classical 

listeners and to many who 
might not otherwise listen 
to classical music. For this 
reason his work can be found 
in wide-ranging places, from 
the 
Netflix 
documentary 

series 
“Chef’s 
Table” 
to 

the Royal Opera House in 
London. 
My 
reintroduction 

to “Sleep” was instigated a 
few weeks ago in New York, 
when I encountered it as part 
of a video involved with the 
Mysterious 
Landscapes 
of 

Hercules Segers exhibit at the 
Met (also featuring the voice of 
John Malkovich).

I recognized it then, but 

the feeling is even stronger 
now, 
that 
something 
about 

“Sleep” 
is 
incomprehensibly, 

inexplicably sad. Throughout 
the composition, there is an 
unplaceable feeling of loss, some 
sort of absence of something 
I hadn’t known was missing. 
I just can’t quite place where 
this feeling comes from, but 
it permeates the entirety of 
the work. But even in sadness, 
“Sleep” reflects a world that is 
calm, peaceful and entirely our 
own. Everywhere in “Sleep,” 
the music pulls you towards 
the realm of dreams. It beckons 
you into a world where you are 
unable to be touched by the 
troubles of reality. It creates a 
space in which you are free from 
care and obligation, where you 
may go to rest your weary head.

It’s calling me now. I think 

I’ll answer.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Nowadays, it’s tough to get 
excited about another sighting of 
The Weeknd.
Some time between the 2016 
release of his moody, sporadic 
pop spectacle, “Starboy;” the 
February launch of the album’s 
touring counterpart, which is 
set to hit sixteen countries in its 
first three months; his alleged 
swap from “dating” model Bella 
Hadid to strutting around the 
world with actress/singer Selena 
Gomez; and the recent revealing 
of his joint clothing venture with 
international fast-fashion house 
H&M; I began to feel exhausted 
of rooting for Abel Tesfaye to 
succeed.
After all, his superstardom is 
no longer a coincidence: The 
Weeknd is a now strategic pop 
machine, clearly evolved from 
the blacklight-illuminated-bed-
room crooner who we first met 
on “House Of Balloon.” He seems 
to put out content according to a 
carefully plotted schedule rather 
than based on his own artistic 
patience, a fact that haunts my 
fandom and consistently tests it.
From this perspective, it’s easy 
to dismiss The Weeknd’s music 
video for “I Feel It Coming” — 
the Daft-Punk-assisted finale to 
“Starboy,” and his most recent 
radio hit — as the uninspired, 
natural conclusion to a series 
of (mostly) disconnected short 
films that were clearly churned 
out only to promote the album 
(and now tour).
The video’s vintage space theme, 
initiated right in its opening 
credits, is such an obvious choice 
for a Daft Punk feature, as is the 
revival of a Michael Jackson 

jacket for a pop music video. 
Plus, its “plot” is seemingly non-
existent until almost halfway 
through — the first two minutes 

meagerly show Abel dancing solo 
against an exceptionally moody, 
intergalactic sunset.
Still, “I Feel It Coming,” much 
like The Weeknd himself, has 
a way of wooing you when you 
most wish it wouldn’t. Sure, 
some of the music video’s props 
are played out, but Abel looks 
damn good in that jacket, and his 
dance moves aren’t bad either. 
Who cares if the gorgeous back-
drop is computer-generated, or 
if we never find out how The 
Weeknd landed upon it in the 
first place?
I’ve watched this music video 
dozens of times now, and though 
I’m still not sure exactly what 
happens between Abel and his 
Medusa-inspired space prin-

cess, that’s fine: I keep watching 
anyway. “I Feel It Coming” is 
one of the strongest bubblegum 
pop tunes in recent memory, 
somehow managing to effort-
lessly mesh old-school coolness 
with space-bot futurism all while 
maintaining a facade of minimal-
ism.
And as for its visual accompani-
ment, the nonchalance with 
which this music video animates 
The Weeknd’s signature shtick; 
its smirking presentation of him, 
carefully-shaded, overly-self-
indulgent, glitter-coated and 
all, for five straight minutes, his 
mere presence and slight smile 
acting as the only hook; the 
way that this video is hollow, 
yet pretends to be bigger than 
itself, acting artsy without add-
ing much substance, bringing in 
arm candy without giving her a 
name or even a character; these 
traits make Warren Fu’s short 
film feel perfectly fit to help fans 
visualize “I Feel It Coming.” 
Perhaps we should be calling it a 
masterpiece.

PALACE FILMS

‘Things to Come’ shines

There are so many films 

that really try to be about 
something. “My movie’s about 
technology” or “My movie’s 
about parenting,” a writer 
or 
director 
or 

producer 
might 

say 
(or 
not-so-

subtly 
display 

on 
the 
screen), 

hoping 
to 
grab 

onto the coattails 
of 
ephemeral 

salience. This isn’t 
to say that these movies are 
bad; on the contrary, they’re 
often critical in shaping our 
cultural, political and societal 
conversations. But these films 
often become polemic, spoiling 
their would-be fascinating life 
tales in favor of a “message.”

Rarer are the movies that 

aren’t really about anything, 
and in the process become 
about 
everything 
— 
about 

life, 
love, 
loss, 
longing, 

leaving. Films that illuminate 
the stories being lived by 
those around us: the lawyer 
handling your tort claim (see 
Kelly 
Reichardt’s 
“Certain 

Women”), your bus driver (see 
Jim Jarmusch’s “Paterson”) or 
your high school philosophy 
teacher.

That last one is the subject 

of “Things to Come,” the latest 
from up-and-coming French 
writer-director Mia Hansen-
Løve (“Eden”). The film stars 
Isabelle Huppert (“Elle”) as 

Nathalie, an aging philosophy 
instructor whose life begins 
to unravel. Her elderly mother 
is losing her marbles (and 
Nathalie temporarily adopts 
her allergy-inducing cat), she’s 
separating from her husband, 
also 
a 
philosophy 
teacher, 

after he meets someone else 

meanwhile, 
protesters, 
calling 
for 

better pensions, 
interrupt 
her 

teaching.

Nathalie, 

briefly a former 
Communist, 
is 

resilient. Her tragedies are met 
with grace; she defends herself 
against a publishing company 
turning their back on her, and 
she advocates for a former 
student 
turned 
intellectual 

and writer, Fabien (Roman 
Kolinka, 
“Eden”). 
As 
the 

travails of her daily life become 
more and more unbearable, she 
decides to visit Fabien to the 
sounds of Woody Guthrie in 
his new home outside of Paris, 
a rustic commune among the 
mountains.

Hansen-Løve and Huppert 

make a brilliant pair. The 
camera is always in motion, 
placing the audience within 
conversations. 
Hansen-Løve 

often opts to film a character’s 
reaction to a line; the effect 
is 
a 
deep 
understanding 

of the film’s relationships. 
When Heinz (André Marcon, 
“Marguerite”) tells Nathalie of 
his affair, we hear his guilt, but 
we see her anguish.

It 
helps 
that 
Huppert, 

undeniably one of the greatest 
living actors, is on screen for 
much of the film. She can 
easily slip into a role, fully 
living the part on film with 
ease. Nathalie is no exception. 
She can be feeble or forceful, 
intellectual or still learning. 
She’s a complex individual 
whose thoughts, actions and 
words are intricately brought 
to life.

Hansen-Løve’s 
screenplay, 

further, 
is 
quick, 
yet 

unburdened 
by 
clunky 

exposition 
in 
dialogue. 

Characters 
reveal 
facts 

through their language, but it 
feels perfectly natural, like a 
French Kenneth Lonergan.

At the risk of ascribing an 

“about” to a movie already 
deemed here to be “about” 
nothing in particular, “Things 
to 
Come” 
vividly 
portrays 

one 
woman’s 
navigation 

through 
compromises. 
Her 

philosophical treatises often 
intertwine with the dueling 
notions of thought and action 
— a debate rendered in real 
time among the protesting 
students, as well as within 
Fabien’s internal struggle over 
how to create a better world. 
But Hansen-Løve did not have 
to compromise: this movie 
sings, from the stunning shots 
of the French countryside to 
the kitchen sink drama set 
against 
bookshelves, 
once 

overloaded but now with some 
of their contents ripped out — 
casualties from separation.

Will the winner matter?

Nicki Minaj vs. Remy Ma. 

If you haven’t heard about it 
yet, you should probably start 
following at least one trashy 
media service on Twitter.

Long 
story 
short, 
Nicki 

contributed a couple feature 
verses earlier this year that 
may or may not have been 
about Remy, and so a couple 
weeks 
ago 
Remy 
released 

“ShETHER,” a vicious seven-
minute diss track, and followed 
it up a few days later with 
“Another One.” The songs 
harken back to Nas’ 2001 Jay-Z 
diss track “Ether” and Drake’s 
2015 Meek Mill diss track 
“Back to Back,” respectively. 
Nicki responded last week with 
three new tracks, two of which 
— “No Frauds” and “Changed 
It” — take aim at Remy.

This is usually the point 

where we look at the material 
and everyone takes sides on 
who “won.” So, who won? 
Frankly, no one. There can’t be 
a winner when the opponents 
aren’t even playing the same 
game. 

In an era when good quality 

doesn’t necessarily translate 
to high sales figures, these 
two artists have very different 

criteria for what constitutes 
the title “Queen of Rap.” Who 
fought 
harder? 
Definitely 

Remy. “ShETHER” took shots 
from all angles, not to mention 
the dismembered Nicki Minaj 
Barbie that appears on the 
cover art. Who sold more? 
Nicki, for sure. “No Frauds” 
topped the iTunes charts in 
multiple 
countries 
and 
its 

streaming traffic was over 100 
times that of “ShETHER.”

Remy Ma is honoring the 

same set of rules that the Nas 
/ Jay-Z fued operated under: 
long-winded rap verses that 
solely function to harshly insult 
opponents, firing rumors, facts 
and alternative facts alike. She 
drags Minaj with a number 
of scathing accusations like 
having a ghostwriter, sleeping 
her way to the top and funding 
her convicted-felon brother’s 
wedding.

Nicki’s 
game 
is 
very 

different. I think she outlines 
her rules best in her now-
deleted 
Instagram 
post 

announcing the new tracks. In 
a screenshot she writes, “Here 
@ Young Money, we don’t do 
diss records, we drop HIT 
RECORDS & diss u ON them,” 
a line with a flow so good that 
she makes a strong case against 
the ghostwriter accusations.

Minaj is obviously more 

concerned with topping the 
charts than hitting back. Both 
“No Frauds” and “Changed It” 
take swings at Remy, but do so 
in a abbreviated fashion, only 
lending a verse each to feud-
related insults. She doesn’t 
take on Remy with a solo track, 
but with songs featuring rap 
heavyweights Drake and Lil 
Wayne, ensuring that her sales 
and popularity skyrocket.

Given this, we now consider 

a new question: Whose rules 
are we playing by? That’s an 
issue that emcompasses far 
more that the Nicki / Remy 
dispute. In a world dominated 
by social media and the mass 
collection of data, it seems 
that popularity and charts 
take 
precedent. 
I 
imagine 

most people who generate 
an opinion on this feud take 
Nicki’s side, simply because 
they know who she is.

But we can not write off 

Remy merely because she’s 
less popular. When she ignited 
this feud, she thought she was 
starting another Nas / Jay-Z 
debacle. If she had, she would 
take the crown.

But this is 2017, not 2001. 

The content matters and the 
numbers matter. So until these 
women enter the same arena, 
there can be no winner.

Famed feud brought to TV

The 
opening 
credits 
of 

“FEUD: Bette and Joan” are 
gorgeous, 
taking 
aesthetic 

inspiration from the cinema 
of the 1960s. The technicolor 
silhouette 
animation 
is 
visually 

reminiscent 
of 

“Mad 
Men,” 

though the theme 
is less nostalgic 
and more urgent; 
instead of a man 
falling through a 
history of trends 
and fads painted 
onto skyscrapers, 
this sequence involves two 
women circling each other in 
ever-shrinking circlets. The 
most chilling shots are those of 
a man who has the marionette 
strings connected to these 
women 
wrapped 
carefully 

around his fingers, making 
them dance and another man 
ashing his cigar, causing little 
Oscars statues to fall from the 
end of it. The pilot episode of 
the show is just as enthralling 
as the credits; it’s the kind 
of show that has you inching 
forward on your seat and 
holding your breath without 
realizing until the screen cuts 
to black.

The episode sets up the 

legendary feud between Bette 
Davis and Joan Crawford, two 
power icons of Hollywood, 
through the story of their 
only film together: “Whatever 
Happened to Baby Jane,” a 
movie about a similar rivalry 
between two women in 1962. 
Fittingly, Bette and Joan are 
played by Susan Sarandon 
(“Thelma and Louise”) and 
Jessica 
Lange 
(“American 

Horror Story”) respectively, 
two women whose careers 
have been full of rich and 

powerful roles. The supporting 
cast, 
full 
of 
recognizable 

faces 
like 
Stanley 
Tucci 

(“The Devil Wears Prada”), 
Alfred Molina (“Spider Man 
2”), Kathy Bates (“American 
Horror Story”), Judy Davis 
(“The 
Dressmaker”), 
and 

up-and-comer Kiernan Shipka 

(“Mad 
Men”) 

is phenomenal, 
but 
Sarandon 

and Lange are 
formidable. 
Both command 
every 
room 

fully; 
each 

scene 
they’re 

in 
together 

is 
thick 
with 

tension. 
They 

move 
through 

magnificent, 
lonely 
halls 

and 
delicately 
constructed 

film 
sets 
with 
alternating 

carelessness and overt self-
awareness, warily eyeing not 
only each other but everyone 
else in the room.

If you’re attuned to the 

eccentricities 
that 
Ryan 

Murphy can’t help but bring to 
his work, you can catch some 
of them in the pilot — perhaps 
most tellingly, a scene in which 
Joan, playing a character who 
is confined to a wheelchair, 
sees 
Bette 
talking 
quietly 

with one of the directors 
and, instead of getting up 
and 
striding 
confidently 

over to them, wheels herself 
angrily towards them. There 
is a perfectly crafted scene 
involving 
the 
two 
women 

angling for a specific chair that 
will give them top billing in the 
next morning’s paper, and it 
could not be more meticulously 
choreographed. 
The 
two 

women never take their eyes 
off each other, metaphorically 
— they are straining, always on 
the edge of propriety, on the 
edge of their seats, on the edge 
of snapping at each other’s 
throats.

The show’s weakest point 

is trying too hard to make a 
feminist point through bits of 
dialogue between the women, 
when the plotlines and even 
the score do it more effectively. 
There are several one-liners 
that are thinly veiled criticisms 
of how we treat older women 
in the media and Hollywood, 
but it is often unclear what 
brand of feminism they are 
truly seeking to represent. At 
times, these lines slip into the 
narrative that women are more 
cruel to each other than they 
are to men, or than men are to 
them, and it feels incongruous 
and wrongfully placed, even in 
a show about a feud between 
two famous women.

The pilot captures what 

happens 
when 
beloved 

ingenues grow into powerful, 
sometimes unlikeable women, 
and what those women must 
do to keep their power at the 
expense of — well, it’s still 
unclear. It captures what it 
feels like to watch your own 
work, an intensely private yet 
also public experience in the 
film industry. The punch that 
this show packs comes not from 
the unfolding of any feud yet 
(incidentally, I have a suspicion 
that once the feud builds, it’ll 
lessen the intensity). Rather, 
the bite of the show comes 
from the remorselessness of 
Hollywood and the media in 
creating a culture in which, 
as multiple people point out, 
there can only be one “It girl.” 
If the rest of the season is this 
clever and well-paced, slinking 
towards a kinetic explosion 
of raw energy, then it has the 
potential to be a phenomenal 
bit of storytelling and one of 
Ryan Murphy’s better pieces.

LET THE MADNESS BEGIN

INDIANAPOLIS 
— 
Fresh 

off 
a 
Big 
Ten 
Tournament 

championship, 
the 
Michigan 

men’s 
basketball 
team 
has 

experienced a rapid turnaround. 
After four games in as many days, 
the Wolverines will take the court 
once again Friday — albeit on a 
much bigger stage.

While the magic of March 

Madness has already struck 
Michigan once, the Wolverines 
will officially open play in the 
NCAA Tournament in what 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
called “the heart of the Big 
Ten”.

Bankers Life Fieldhouse — the 

site of the 2016 Big Ten Tournament 
— should bring back positive 
memories for the Wolverines. Last 
year, the arena played host to No. 8 
seed Michigan’s miracle win over 
No. 1 seed Indiana on a buzzer-
beating corner three from former 
wing Kam Chatman.

This season, the Wolverines 

(24-11) are far from underdogs. 
As the No. 7 seed in the Midwest 
Region, Michigan will take on No. 
10 seed Oklahoma State (20-12) in 
the first round of the Big Dance. 
And while the Wolverines won 
their conference tournament in 
impressive fashion — defeating 
ranked opponents such as then-
No. 13 Purdue and then-No. 24 
Wisconsin — the Cowboys fell 
in the quarterfinals of the Big 12 
Tournament to No. 23 Iowa State.

“The whole goal at Michigan 

is 
to 
win 
championships. 

And if you compete for a Big 
Ten 
championship, 
you’re 

going to compete for national 
championships,” 
Beilein 
said. 

“… Our league, year in and year 
out, can play with anybody in the 

country.”

Despite the disparities between 

the two sides, both teams have 
similarities leading up to Friday’s 
matchup. Michigan and Oklahoma 
State 
are 
both 
characterized 

by their shooting ability from 
anywhere on the court, and by 
their transition offense predicated 
on forcing and capitalizing on 
turnovers. 

While 
the 
Cowboys 
score 

an average of 85.5 points per 
game compared to 74.8 for the 
Wolverines, 
Michigan 
boasts 

a higher scoring margin due to 
the strength of its defense. The 
Wolverines give up just 65.5 points 

per game, whereas Oklahoma 
State allows its opponents to score 
an average of 78.

The 
Cowboys 
carry 
the 

edge 
from 
beyond 
the 
arc, 

though, shooting 40.1 percent 
compared to 38.1 for Michigan. 
Its perimeter defense is better as 
well, as Oklahoma State allows its 
opponents to shoot 35.8 percent 
while the Wolverines give up a 37.8 
shooting percentage.

All 
five 
Cowboy 
starters 

will prove to be a challenge for 
Michigan to contain, particularly 
guard Jawun Evans, wing Jeffrey 
Carroll and guard Phil Forte III 
— all of whom boast double-digit 

scoring averages at 19, 17.4 and 13.3, 
respectively. While the Wolverines 
are more used to that level of 
scoring from dominant big men in 
the Big Ten, they will have to adapt 
to the Big 12’s plethora of skilled 
guard play. 

“It’s a balance,” Beilein said. “… 

You have to be prepared for a team 
that is going to be unique to you. 
At the same time, you can’t make 
yourself unique to yourself by 
trying to out-trick them.”

While Michigan must stand up 

to that test, Oklahoma State will 
have its own test to take. All five 
Wolverine starters also have the 
potential to pile it on in a hurry due 
to the success of their pick-and-
pop game.

Four of them average double-

digit point totals — senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr., senior wing Zak 
Irvin, sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner and redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson with 15.2, 12.8, 
12 and 10.6, respectively — and the 
lone starter shy of the mark is just 
0.9 points away.

“You pick your poison with 

whichever you choose (to guard),” 
said Oklahoma State coach Brad 
Underwood. “You’ve got to make 
it difficult and not allow them to 
be as comfortable as they want to 
be, and then you’ve got to contest 
shots.”

Michigan 
gained 
national 

attention after the near-tragic 
plane incident last Wednesday, but 
the Wolverines gained national 
acclaim for turning that experience 
into a title run. According to Irvin, 
their mindset throughout the 
tournament centered on one key 
question:

“Why can’t this be one of the 

greatest stories ever told?”

While Michigan closed the first 

chapter Sunday, its postseason 
story continues Friday.

Michigan to open NCAA Tournament against hot-shooting Oklahoma State

BETELHEM ASHAME

Managing Sports Editor

INDIANAPOLIS — It’s been 

going on all season.

Derrick Walton Jr. brings the 

ball up the court. Moritz Wagner 
saunters from the top of the key 
and sets a high-ball screen. The 
sophomore forward plants his 
6-foot-11 frame on his senior point 
guard’s defender.

Walton drives by Wagner’s left 

shoulder with a decision to make 
— take it to the hole or feed it to 
his big man, unattended behind 
the arc with his hands prepared 
for a pass that may never come 
and a shot he wants to take.

More often than not, it goes 

something like this: Wagner 
gets the ball, knocks it down 
and heads down the court with 
some variation of the emotional 
celebration he has become known 
for. It’s all too easy.

Tomorrow 
afternoon, 

Oklahoma 
State 
has 
the 

unpleasant task of making that a 
lot harder.

As Big Ten play ran its course, 

eventually, the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team’s 
conference 

foes caught on. Any time the 
Wolverines faced a conference 
team for the second time, Wagner 
noticed the adjustments.

Some teams would have their 

‘4’ guard Wagner from the get-go, 
hoping to switch screens more 
effectively. Others would simply 
try to run Wagner off the line, 
often to no avail.

“If somebody runs you off the 

line, you just gotta shot fake and 
dribble,” Wagner said. “I think 
that’s something I do pretty well.”

Added 
Michigan 
assistant 

coach Saddi Washington: “I think 

it actually helped us, from being 
able to compare the moments like 
that so that this isn’t the first time 
we’re seeing a five-man switching 
rotation from a defense.”

The bottom line is that the 

majority 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

competition has had multiple 
cracks at bringing Michigan’s 
pick-and-pop system crumbling 
down. Most of the time, those 
teams have failed.

On Friday afternoon, though, 

Oklahoma State needs to buck 
that trend. If the Cowboys don’t, 
then their tournament is likely to 
end early.

The Cowboys have seen plenty 

of talented guards in the Big 12, 
Frank Mason III and Monte 
Morris being just two of them. 
How they fare against Walton 
may not be the problem, but how 
they fare against Wagner could be 
a big one.

Oklahoma State hasn’t seen a 

big man like Wagner or redshirt 
sophomore DJ Wilson all season.

Cowboy 
forward 
Mitchell 

Solomon said Wagner reminds 
him of Baylor’s Johnathan Motley 
and Texas Christian’s Vladimir 
Brodziansky, but even they don’t 
“play outside as much as Wagner”.

And that’s an understatement. 

Wagner 
has 
attempted 
108 

3-pointers 
and 
converted 
at 

a 40.7 percent clip. Motley 
and 
Brodziansky, 
however, 

have attempted just 31 and 29, 
respectively.

“It’s 
completely 
different,” 

Solomon said. “Almost all the 
guys in the Big 12 are big bruisers 
that we’ve done a lot of battle in 
the paint. It’s going to be different 
playing out on the perimeter a 
little more, but I think we’ll be 
ready for it.”

Wolverines rely on ‘pick-and-pop’ to 
utilize mixture of size and shooting

NCAA-tourney snub Wolverines 
open WNIT by beating Kent State

A basketball left the fingertips 

of a Kent State guard, soaring in an 
arc over mid-court trying to get to 
a teammate. The ball would never 
reach its destination. 

Six-foot-five 
Hallie 
Thome 

reached up and plucked the 
ball out of its course, with the 
sophomore center’s toes barely 
lifting off the ground. The play 
demonstrated 
the 
blistering 

defense 
that 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team boasted 
all night en route to a 67-60 victory 
over the Golden Flashes (13-5 Mid-
American, 19-12) at Crisler Center 
on Thursday. 

Though still reeling from being 

left out of the NCAA Tournament, 
Michigan (11-5 Big Ten, 22-9 
overall) 
proved 

its 
dominance 

on 
the 
court 

once again in the 
first game of the 
Women’s National 
Invitation 
Tournament, 
despite a string 
of four losses in 
its previous five 
games. 

“Coming 
into 

this, we knew we 
had to prove a point to the NCAA 
and make them realize they made 
a mistake with leaving us out,” 
Thome said. “Then again, we 
still have to realize we’re still in a 
tournament and we’re lucky to be 
in a tournament and still playing 
right now. So we got to push 
through it, and if we’re in it, we 
might as well try to go all the way.” 

A clear mantra for the team 

was playing for their seniors, 
guards Danielle Williams and 
Siera Thompson, who both will 
have been shut out of the NCAA 
Tournament when they graduate 
in April. The Wolverines are 
hungry for the WNIT title, too, 
with hopes to unfurl their first 
banner in program history at 
Crisler Center. 

“Even though it’s not the banner 

we want to hang, it’s a start in the 
right direction,” Thome said. 
“Although we want to prove a 
point, we have to make sure we 
take care of business at the end of 
the day.” 

The 
game 
started 

unsurprisingly, 
with 
three 

3-point shots from junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty within the 
first three minutes of play. The 
Golden Flashes tried to respond 
and managed only one trey and 
one free throw in the same time 
frame. 

By the end of the game, 

Flaherty had amassed 22 points, 
with 
Thome 
trailing 
behind 

with 13 and Thompson with 
10. Thome needs just 11 more 
points to surpass 1,000 career 
points. Notably, Thompson, after 
this game, became the school 

record 
holder 

— in both men’s 
and 
women’s 

basketball — for 
minutes 
played 

(4,571).

Following 

an 
aggressive 

first 
period 

performance 
by 
Flaherty, 

the 
Wolverines 

pulled 
away 

further 
with 

a 
dominant 
second 
quarter, 

bringing with them a 43-22 lead 
into halftime. Both Flaherty and 
freshman guard Kysre Gondrezick 
hit back-to-back threes, though 
the most noteworthy basket came 
with a period-ending buzzer-
beater — a mid-range jump shot off 
the fingertips of sophomore guard 
Nicole Munger. 

Flaherty’s scoring was the 

difference-maker in the first half, 
but also apparent was Flaherty’s 
extra emphasis on rebounds, a 
relatively uncharted territory for 
her. She tallied five total. 

“It was different,” Flaherty said. 

“I’m really trying to expand my 
game and that’s one of the things 
my coaches wanted me to work 
on. So (the basketball) kind of fell 
to me today, and I was more ball-

conscious than I usually am.” 

Added Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico: “I was really happy 
about the way she went in and she 
mixed it up. I thought we did a 
great job, too, of finding her. She’s 
really been shooting the basketball 
exceptionally well in practice. 
… She’s really worked hard on 
becoming a better rebounder, and 
that showed tonight.” 

Though the Golden Flashes 

tried to overcome the deficit in 
the third – even almost coming 
within 10 points – Michigan 
quickly dismissed any hopes for 
redemption, finishing the period 
up 55-43. 

With six minutes to go in the 

final period of the game, Kent State 
began to upend the Wolverines’ 
confidence when a layup put them 
within eight points of Michigan’s 
total. 

At the 3:50 mark, a jump 

ball call left the Golden Flashes 
with 
possession. 
But 
Kent 

State couldn’t capitalize, and 
the Wolverines extended their 
point total to 61. The Golden 
Flashes rebounded quickly and 
recaptured momentum to bring 
their deficit to just five points — 
the closest the game had been 
since the first minute. 

With 1:40 remaining, a pair 

of free throws by senior guard 
Siera Thompson and a basket 
the 
following 
possession 
by 

Gondrezick gave the Wolverines a 
nine-point advantage in the final 
minute of play — a far cry from the 
21-point lead it held following the 
half, but comfortable enough to 
secure the victory. 

“It was an ugly win tonight,” 

Flaherty said. “But, you know, it’s 
just good to come out with the 
win.” 

Regardless, Michigan pulled 

through in the end to notch its 
23rd win of the season, breaking 
the program record for most wins 
in a season. 

“I want this group to be able 

to look back and say (this is 
something special),” Barnes Arico 
said. “They did a lot of great things 
for that to happen this year.”

‘M’ falls to Penn State, season 
ends at Big Ten Tournament

Six days ago, the Michigan 

hockey team secured its first 
sweep of the season over then-
No.11 Penn State. The sweep was 
important — not only did it close 
out a season at Yost Ice Arena 
and honor the roster’s seniors, 
but it also secured wins for the 
Wolverines in the last games the 
two teams would play before 
facing off in the first round of 
the Big Ten Tournament. 

But the 15th-ranked Nittany 

Lions (11-9-1 Big Ten, 22-11-2 
overall) wouldn’t accept a third-
straight loss to 
the Wolverines, 
capitalizing 
on 

early scoring to 
beat 
Michigan, 

4-1. 
For 
Penn 

State, 
the 

win meant an 
advancement to 
the second round 
of the Big Ten 
Tournament 
to 

face Minnesota 
at Joe Louis Arena on Friday.

For the Wolverines (6-13-2, 

13-19-3), though, it meant their 
season would come to an end.

“You knew it would be a hard-

fought game,” said Michigan 
coach Red Berenson. “We just 
played Penn State two games at 
Yost last weekend, and I thought 
the team that got the best start 
tonight was going to have the 
advantage, and obviously they 
took advantage. They scored I 
think with six seconds left in 
that penalty and then scored 
a late goal, last-minute goal in 
the first period, and we just 
couldn’t answer the bell.

“It was a tough night to get 

things 
started 
offensively. 

Their goalie was good when he 
had to be. And give Penn State 
credit, they played hard the 
whole game and they played the 
right way. We just weren’t good 
enough.”

The first period started with 

both teams on even footing. But 
the Nittany Lions soon began to 
dominate, and, by the end of the 
first period, they had three goals 
on the scoreboard to show for it. 
 

After 
freshman 
forward 

Jake Slaker was called for 
charging, Penn State found 
itself with a range of power-
play 
opportunities. 
Forward 

Brandon 
Biro 
managed 
to 

control the puck behind senior 
goaltender Zach Nagelvoort’s 
net, and after initially looking 
to circle back to the other end, 
he passed it to forward Liam 
Folkes. The ensuing shot put 
Penn State ahead with 9:50 

left in the first 
period.

Just 
over 

two 
minutes 

later, 
though, 

the 
Nittany 

Lions recorded 
another 
goal 

when 
Ricky 

DeRosa 
broke 

up a Michigan 
pass, 
and 
the 

puck eventually 

landed in the hands of Nate 
Sucese, who finished it off for 
the second goal at the 13:24 
mark.

With 29 seconds remaining 

in the period, forward David 
Goodwin scored again to put 
the Nittany Lions up 3-0 at the 
end of the first period.

The offensive initiative from 

Penn State didn’t end there, 
though. 
Defenseman 
Vince 

Pedrie jumpstarted the second 
period with a goal just over 
a minute in, and the Nittany 
Lions were playing with a four-
goal lead.

“The message (going into the 

second period) was (to) try to 
keep doing what we were doing 
and stay the same,” said Penn 
State coach Guy Gadowsky. 
“Unfortunately for us, I think 
Michigan came out a lot stronger, 
they took a few chances that paid 
off and were able to generate a 
lot more shots.”

The Wolverines almost wound 

up on the board when freshman 
forward Adam Winborg forced 
a shot on Penn State goaltender 
Peyton 
Jones 
that 
senior 

forward Alex Kile cleaned up, 
but Michigan was offsides and 
the goal was waived.

It wasn’t until the 10:19 point 

in the second period that the 
Wolverines finally managed to 
land on the scoreboard. Junior 
forward 
Tony 
Calderone’s 

shot sent the puck into the air, 
and freshman forward James 
Sanchez deflected it into the 
net, making the score 4-1 
headed into the third period.

Michigan began to lay on 

shots, but its late start to the 
game proved to be destructive. 
Sophomore 
forward 
Cooper 

Marody tried to capitalize on 
an open net when Jones found 
himself trying to cover the 
puck, but the shot hit the post 
instead. 

A late power play occurred 

when forward Chase Berger 
landed in the penalty box for 
hooking, but the opportunity 
didn’t result in a goal. By the 
time Berger stepped back on 
the ice, 1:30 remained in the 
third 
period. 
And 
despite 

an additional power play, no 
goals would be scored, and 
the hopeful weekend wouldn’t 
be big for the Wolverines 
like the sweep had been last 
weekend. There was no win, 
no celebration for the seniors, 
no momentum heading into the 
next weekend. Just a 4-1 loss 
that knocked the Wolverines 
out of the tournament.

“I 
think 
it’s 
extremely 

emotional,” Calderone said. “I 
mean, obviously for the seniors, 
but even for us. I think as 
juniors we’ve only got one more 
year left, and it’s always easy to
