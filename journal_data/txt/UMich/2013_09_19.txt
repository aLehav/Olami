CSG seeks

Proppe e-mails
survey, wants leaders
for student commitee
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily Staff Reporter
To maximize student input in
the search for the next Univer-
sity president, LSA student gov-
ernment has created a survey to
determine what qualities the col-
lege's students seek in President
Mary Sue Coleman's successor.
Student government lead-
ers e-mailed a link to the survey
Wednesday. The survey poses
six questions focused specifically
towards the needs of LSA stu-
dents and improvements the next
president should focus on.
"This input will be instrumen-
tal in helping the regents choose
the best candidate to lead the
University after President Cole-
man retires in the spring," the
e-mail said.
LSA-SG President Sagar
Lathia said leaders hope respons-
es would demonstrate the
school's diversity.

"One of the biggest things I
wanted to make sure was that
the LSA constituency got heard
no matter what," Lathia, and LSA
and business senior, said. "It's
just to assure that LSA students
could get their word out."
Less than 24 hours later, a
similar stride was taken through
the office of the Central Student
Government. As promised at that
assembly's Tuesday meeting,
CSG President Michael Proppe
sent an e-mail to the entire stu-
dent body today, informing them
of the upcoming student involve-
ment in the presidential search
process.
Last week, the University
Council - a governing body con-
sisting of student presidents from
all the University schools and
colleges - introduced a resolu-
tion that would create a student-
driven committee to provide
input to the University's Board of
Regents until the next president
is selected. Organizers say stu-
dent committee was created due
to a lack of student representa-
tion on the regent's Presidential
Search Advisory Committee.

Opposing groups
face off to garner
student attention
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily Staff Reporter
The two sides of the debate
on abortion rights were clear on
the Diag Wednesday as groups
staged dueling demonstrations.
The University's chapter

of Students for Life set up 915
pink crosses in front of the flag
post, along with large pink signs
explainingeach cross represents
the number of abortions that,
according to the Planned Par-
enthood Project, are performed
in America by Planned Parent-
hood each day.
The Planned Parenthood
Project is not affiliated with the
Planned Parenthood network of
healthcare clinics. Rather, the
project is a touring group spon-

sored by Students for Life of
America that criticizes the orga-
nization, which is a major pro-
vider of abortions in the United
States.
The University is one of
41 stops for the project. The
18,041-mile tour encompasses
campuses in 20 states over an
eight-week period.
LSA sophomore Amanda
Salvi, Students for Life's pub-
licity chair, claimed that many
people are misinformed about

Planned Parenthood.
"In a recent survey, 55 per-
cent of Americans did not know
that Planned Parenthood com-
mits abortion," Salvi said, in
reference to a poll performed by
the Students for Life organiza-
tion. "Since it's such a controver-
sial issue, not many people talk
about it, let alone know about it,
so we're here to stir some con-
versation."

TRANSPORTATION
Officials gear
up Ann Arbor
for bike share


City, University
planning tentative
spring launch
By YARDAIN AMRON
For the Daily
The end of winter term
may seem an eternity away,
but come springtime, Ann
Arbor is aiming to have its
own bike share program for
public use.
With the Ann Arbor
City Council's approval last
month to partner with Clean
Energy Coalition - a non-
profit that promotes clean
energy technologies - fund-
ing for Phase 1 of the program
fell into place. The question
now remains whether the
program will have similar
success to the fast-growing
number of bike share pro-
grams popping up across the
country.

To use the system - which
is tentatively scheduled to
open on April1,2014 - riders
must first buy a membership,
with rates ranging from $60
annually, $20 weekly or $5
daily.
These fees allow mem-
bers to swipe their Mcards
at any station, where they
can ride free of charge for
up to 30 minutes. For every
subsequent half-hour, a
yet to be determined usage
fee is charged to the mem-
ber's account. Bikes can be
returned to any station on
campus.
Steve Dolen, the Univer-
sity's executive director of
parking and transportation
services, said officials have
discussed the possibility of
linking B-cycle membership
to the Mcard system, but
that is low on the priority list
compared to getting the sys-
tem up and running.

Fighting the stress of war

Luke Fishman graduated from
the University in 2013 as a brain,
behavior and cognitive science
major. He is currently living in
Jordan where he works withInter-
national Medical Corps, a non-
profit organization that provides
aid and services to refugees.
What is your role in Jordan?
I am currently a mental-
health and community-protec-
tion intern with the non-profit
organization, International
Medical Corps.
As the devastating situation
in Syria continues to deteriorate
and the numberof displaced Syr-
ian refugees rises above 2-mil-
lion people, IMC has stepped

up its efforts to offer more and
more services in Jordan.
What were the most
important lessons you
learned at the University?
The first is to be a quick and
adaptive learner. I think at the
University of Michigan every
student takes such a broad col-
lection of courses that require
the use of a variety of skills in
order to succeed.
The second is to be open to
the people and opportunities
that present themselves in your
life. At Michigan, I was able to
meet and become friends with
people from all over the coun-
try and even world.

What would you like your
fellow Wolverines to know
about your experience?
Unfortunately, a large major-
ity of these refugees are women
and children. They are engulfed
in an environment of violence,
sexual abuse and a shortage of
basic amenities, such as food and
water. However, as bad as things
are,the workhumanitarianorga-
nizations, like IMC, are doing is
simply incredible. Because of the
work of these people, thousands
andthousands of people are alive
and have hope.

Syrian military tied to August l
attack due to rocket trajectory -

Mountain troops
evidently fired sarin
gas on civilians
BEIRUT (AP) - The trajec-
tory of the rockets that deliv-
ered the nerve agent sarin in last
month's deadly attack is among
the key evidence linking elite
Syrian troops based in the moun-
tains overlooking Damascus to
the strike that killed hundreds
of people, diplomats and human
rights officials said Wednesday.
The Aug. 21 attack precipitat-
ed the crisis over Syria's chemi-
calweapons. The U.S.threatened
a military strike against Syria,
which led to a plan negotiated by
Moscow and Washington under
which the regime of President
Bashar Assad is to abandon its
chemical weapons stockpile.
A U.N. report released Mon-
day confirmed that chemical
weapons were used in the attack
but did not ascribe blame.

The United States, Britain
and France cited evidence in
the report to declare Assad's
government responsible. Rus-
sia called the report "one-sided"
and says it has "serious reason to
suggest that this was a provoca-
tion" by the rebels fighting the
Assad regime in Syria's civil war.
The report, however, provid-
ed data that suggested the chem-
ical-loaded rockets that hit two
Damascus suburbs were fired
from the northwest, indicating
they came from nearby moun-
tains where the Syrian military
is known to have major bases.
Mount Qassioun, which over-
looks Damascus, is home to one
of Assad's three residences and
is widely used by elite forces to
shell suburbs of the capital. The
powerful Republican Guard and
army's Fourth Division, head-
ed by Assad's younger brother,
Maher, has bases there.
A senior U.N. diplomat, speak-
ing on condition of anonymity
because some of this material

ammosm

was from private meetings, said:
"It was 100 percent clear that the
regime used chemical weapons."
The diplomat cited five key
details, including the scale of the
attack, the quality of the sarin,
the type of rockets, the warheads
used and the rockets' trajectory.
A Human Rights Watch
report also said the presumed
flight path of the rockets cited by
the U.N. inspectors' report led
back to a Republican Guard base
in Mount Qassioun.
"Connecting the dots provid-
ed by these numbers allows us to
see for ourselves where the rock-
ets were likely launched from
and who was responsible," said
Josh Lyons, a satellite imagery
analyst for the New York-based
group. But, he added, the evi-
dence was "not conclusive."
The HRW report matched
what several experts concluded
after reading the U.N. report.
The U.N. inspectors were not
instructed to assess which side
was responsible for the attack.
"While the U.N. stuck within its
mandate, it has provided enough
data to provide an overwhelming
case that this had to be govern-
ment-sponsored," said Anthony
Cordesman, national security
expert at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies.
The inspectors described the
rockets used to disperse the sarin
as a variant of an M14 artillery
rocket, with either an original or
an improvised warhead, which
the rebels are not known to have.
There is no conceivable way to
prove the rebels could not have
gotten them, Cordesman said, but
he added that the modification of
the rockets pointed to the regime.
The U.N. diplomat in New
York pointed to citations in the
U.N. report and a private brief-
ing to the U.N. Security Council
by chief inspector Ake Sellstrom
that reveal the scale of the
attack: The seven rockets exam-
ined had a total payload of about
350 liters (about 92 gallons) of
sarin, including sophisticated
stabilizing elements that match
those known to be in the Syrian
stockpile.

Child beauty
pageants maybe
banned in France
Child beauty pageants may
soon be banned in France, after
a surprise vote in the French
Senate that rattled the pageant
industry and raised questions
about how the French relate to
girls' sexuality.
Such contests, and the made-
up, dolled-up beauty queens they
produce, have the power to both
fascinate and repulse, and have
drawn criticism in several coun-
tries. France, with its control-
ling traditions, appears to be out
front in pushing an outright ban.
French legislators stopped
short of approving a measure
banning anyone under 16 from
modeling products meant for

Brazilian court accepts appeals
in high-profile corruption cases

Rebel group
responsible for
killing civilians
DAKAR, Senegal (AP) - The
rebels who overthrew Central
African Republic's president six
months ago are killing scores of
civilians with impunity, in one
case shooting a woman walking
down the street and leaving her
for dead with a wailing baby still
strapped to her back, an interna-
tionalehuman rights group said
Wednesday.
In a report that document-
ed slayings and the "wanton
destruction" of more than 1,000
homes, Human Rights Watch
called for targeted sanctions
against leaders responsible for
the abuses. The group also urged
the international community to
help support an African Union
peacekeeping mission aimed at
protecting civilians in the after-
math of the March coup led by a
coalition of rebel groups known
collectively as Seleka.
"Seleka leaders promised a
new beginning for the people
of the Central African Repub-

lic, but instead have carried out
large-scale attacks on civilians,
looting and murder," said Daniel
Bekele, Africa director for the
organization.
In one attack documented
by Human Rights Watch, wit-
nesses said a self-appointed
mayor "went door to door in the
village, reassuring fearful resi-
dents it was safe to come out to
talk to the Seleka." Five of those
who did venture out from their
homes were then tied together
and grouped under a tree. The
fighters shot them one by one,
the report said.Whenone victim
did not die, his throat was slit,
witnesses recalled.
On Tuesday, the United States
said it was "gravely concerned
about the recent upsurge in vio-
lence" in Central African Repub-
lic.
"We remain concerned
about continuing violations
of international humanitar-
ian law and reports of wide-
spread human rights abuses by
these rebels. All perpetrators
of these crimes must be held
accountable," said Jen Psaki,
spokeswoman for the U.S. State
Department.

Dozen former
politicians and
business leaders
previously convicted
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -
The Brazilian Supreme Court on
Wednesday accepted the appeals
of a dozen former political and
business leaders found guilty in
the nation's biggest corruption
trial, paving the way for new tri-
als and dealing a blow to those
who hailed the earlier convic-
tions as a turning point against
impunity.
The case involves a scheme
that came to light in 2005 in
which top aides to former Presi-
dent Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
created a scheme to pay off legis-
lators so they would support the
ruling Workers Party initiatives
in Congress.
The guilty verdicts for 25

by corruption and impunity

and decided in a 6-5 vote that
defendants have the right to a
new trial for the criminal counts
for which they earlier received at
least four not-guilty votes.
That means 12 defendants will
get new trials, including Silva's
former chief of staff Jose Dirceu
and the former Workers Party

president Jose Genoino for con-
spiracy, and Joao Cunha, the ex-
leader of Brazil's lower house of
Congress, for money laundering.
Justice Celso de Mello cast
the sixth decisive vote in favor
of the appeals. He had been the
harshest critic of the defendants
during last year's trial, but said
it was his duty to defend the law
and not bend to widespread sup-
port for a quick end to the case.
"If it's true that the Supreme
Court is a place for the protection
and defense of fundamental free-
doms ... then it can't expose itself
to external pressures as a result
of popular outcry and pressure
from crowds," Mello said.
The move will nottotally clear
most of the defendants because
they were convicted on at least
one other charge by too wide of
a margin to allow for an appeal.
But it could allow them to win
a less harsh kind of imprison-
ment and be eligible for parole
earlier.
Some, like Dirceu may avoid
serving their sentences full-
time in prison by being placed
in a "semi-open" regime that
allows them to do supervised
work during the day and sleep
in prison at night.
Nobody has yet been jailed in
connection to the case, which
has angered Brazilians. The
court has not yet decided when
the appeals will be heard.
The Estado de S. Paulo news-
paper lamented in a Wednes-
day editorial that the top court
would miss the opportunity to

reject the appeals and signal that
"a tradition of impunity has been
broken" and "the powerful will
no longer be above the law and
beyond its reach."
The newspaper said impu-
nity is partly the fault of judges
in Brazil's notoriously slow and
complex legal system, with the
dominant idea being that "the
more time-consuming a deci-
sion, the more appeals there are"
the better the ruling.
Joaquim Falcao, a law profes-
sor and legal expert at Rio de
Janeiro's Getulio Vargas Foun-
dation, Brazil's top think tank,
said the justices were faced with
a tough and legitimate technical
question.
He said the top court's inter-
nal legal system allows appeals
on counts that receive at least
four not-guilty votes, but the
constitution doesn't mention
such appeals, leading to the
sharp divide between the jus-
tices.
Falcao said he understands
that frustrated Brazilians just
want the case to end, but he
defended the court's responsibil-
ity to work through the process.
"If the Supreme Court even-
tually absolves the defendants,
then you could have a situation
in which the democratic insti-
tutions are gravely discredited,"
he said. "There may be some
disillusionment with this rul-
ing, but I don't think it's insti-
tutionally grave for democracy.
I think it's more of a delayed
opportunity for justice."

Egypt's ousted president speaks to
family for first time since removal

Military government
permits Morsi
one phone call
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's ousted
president, Mohammed Morsi,
told his wife and children he is
in good health in his first con-
versation with his family since
the military removed him from
office and detained him in a
secret location more than two
months ago, one of his lawyers
said Wednesday.
The phone calls were an
apparent gesture by the military
as authorities prepare to put
Morsi ontrial on charges of incit-
ing the killing of protesters dur-
ing his year in office - though
no date for the trial has been set.
Morsi's legal team has so far not
been able to talk to him, said the
lawyer, Mostafa Atteyah.
The trial of Egypt's first freely
elected president is one link in
a wide-scale crackdown on his
Muslim Brotherhood that has
eviscerated its leadership and
much of its crucial mid-level
organizers. More than 2,000
jailed Brotherhood members are
facing potential prosecution in
multiple cases, with at least half
a dozen cases already referred to
trial.
Members of the Brotherhood's
legal team say the process so far
has been confused and opaque,
with their lawyers given little
access to their clients or knowl-
edge of the cases against them.
Atteyah said they have not been
able to attend Morsi's question-
ing and have not been shown the
prosecutors' final case referring
Morsi to trial.
The Islamist leader has been

held almost completely incom-
municado in an undisclosed
facility since the head of the mili-
tary ousted him on July 3 in the
wake of mass nationwide pro-
tests against him.
Since then, the Brotherhood,
which dominated power during
his year in office, has been reel-
ingunder the crackdown.
At least seven of the 18 mem-
bers of the Brotherhood's top
executive body, the Guidance
Bureau, have been arrested. The
most recent were two detained
along with the group's English-
language spokesman in a raid
Tuesday. Among those held for
weeks is the Brotherhood's top
leader Mohammed Badie, whose
trial on incitement charges is the
only one to have begun so far.
Nearly 1,500 mid-level admin-
istrators are in custody - about
60 percent of the regional man-
agers who do much of the Broth-
erhood's nationwide organizing,
Atteyah said.
Also arrested are most of
the Brotherhood members who
served as provincial governors or
lawmakers during Morsi's year
in office. The crackdown even
netted 56 people on the legal
team formed to defend Morsi
and other group members, said
Atteyah, one of 24 people left on
the team.
The rest of the group's leaders
are in hiding, with the remaining
members of the Guidance Bureau
managingthe group while on the
run, said one Brotherhood mem-
ber, who spoke on condition of
anonymity for security reasons.
The Brotherhood and Morsi's
other supporters continue near
daily protests demanding his
reinstatement. But their protests
have been smaller since security
4

forces violently broke up their
main sit-ins in mid-August,
sparking days of violence that
left over a 1,000 dead, mostly
Morsi supporters.
Authorities accuse the Broth-
erhood and allies of seeking
to undermine the new order
through a wave of violence since
the anti-Morsi protests began
on June 30 - when his sup-
porters repeatedly clashed with
opponents - and after the presi-
dent's ouster, when there was
a backlash of Islamist attacks
on government offices, security
personnel and churches.
Authorities say the group
stockpiled weapons and sup-
ported the attacks. Mostofthose
arrested have been on allega-
tions of inciting violence. The
Brotherhood insists its protests
against the coup are peaceful.
Morsi, who turned 62 last
month in detention, was allowed
to speak by phone with his wife
and children last week and a
second time two days later,
Atteyah said. The lawyer said
he reassured his wife he is in
good health. Morsi also spoke at
length with his son Osama, the
Brotherhood member said.
"I will remain steadfast to
the last breath," Morsi told his
family, according to the Turk-
ish news agency Anadolu, which
first reported the calls. Morsi
did not seem to know where he
was being held, the report said.
Atteyah confirmed the Anadolu
report.
The only visitors Morsi is
known to have seen were EU
foreign policy chief Catherine
Ashton and an African Union del-
egation. A delegation of Egyptian
rights groups was also i ermitted
to see him, but he declined.

Encourage entrepreneurship
Universities should offer financially support student innovation
Located in Palo Alto, Stanford University has long been known to have
deep ties to the surrounding culture of startup companies in Silicon
Valley, but now the school is taking steps to foster its direct involve-
ment. StartX is a student-created nonprofit that helps Stanford students develop
their start-up ideas. Students must go through an application process to receive
assistance from StartX. Those accepted receive training, office space and men-
toring and the program also connects students with potential investors. Stan-
ford University recently announced that they are forming a partnership with
StartX to create the Stanford-StartX Fund to invest in these startups. Programs
that provide resources for student entrepreneurs through funding opportuni-
ties are immeasurably helpful, but may lead to a conflict of interest between the

The show has
been the subject
of debate about
the glorification of the male anti-
hero and, conversely, the prominent
hatred of female characters, like Sky-
ler White (played by Anna Gunn),
who don't conform to archetypical
ideals. On television, men don't have
to be good to be celebrated as being
interesting and they certainly don't
need a moral compass to be cele-
brated as "good". Female characters
aren't written to the same degree of
flawed complexity very often and are
even less frequently praised in roles
where they are.
The second happened when Uni-
versity alum Nina Davuluri made
history when she was crowned the
first Miss America of Indian-Amer-
ican descent. In the days that fol-
lowed, she graciously brushed off
racist complaints that she doesn't
look or act the part of a "typical"
Miss America - whatever that's sup-
posed to mean.
In the entertainment industry,
like other fields where there's a well-
established majority, being a minor-
ity often comes with the expectation
that if you want to succeed, you con-
form to the long-standing cultural
status quo or you destine yourself
for a niche market. If you're simul-
taneously successful and a minority,
then your description usually comes
with qualifications.
Nobody writes of a strongmale TV
character, a best-selling European-
American author, or a famous man
in computer science because those
qualities are implied. To appropri-
ate Toni Morrison, being a minority
and a scientist, or a minority and a
comedian, or even a minority and an
American still means you "have to
hyphenate" your title.
I've found this to be especially
true as a woman studying engineer-
ing. Here at the University, 23 per-
cent of students in the College of
Engineering are female and only 8
percent of all Engineering students
come from historically underrepre-
sented backgrounds. These statistics
reflect national trends: According to

recent studies, less than 25 percent
of jobs in science, technology, engi-
neering and mathematics fields are
held by women, despite the fact that
today women make up almost half of
the workforce.
This data quantifies a frustrating-
ly obvious duality for minorities in
STEM fields. Although discrimina-
tory policies are legally prohibited
in the United States, an internalized
culture of exclusion often prevails.
As recently asS2005, Lawrence Sum-
mers, former president of Harvard
University, was infamously quoted
on his beliefs that the underrepre-
sentation of women in science is due
to inherent biological shortcom-
ings, not because of "discrimination
or socialization."
Attitudes like these are particular-
ly damaging in light of actual facts.
According to studies fundedby the
National Science Foundation, young
women express an initial interest
and aptitude in STEM studies at
similar rates to men, but many who
start off in these fields later drop out.
when interviewed, nearly 40 per-
cent of women and minority students
report feeling discouraged from pur-
suing careers it these fields due to
the culture of those professions.
Even the way textbooks are writ-
ten can impact female interest in
certain fields. Word problems that

serious engineering culture.
Being praised for not "acting like
a girl" is a misplaced designation
of value. Just as I hated being told
in high school that I had "become
American" after I started dressing
and speaking the part of a middle-
class white girl, I find it frustrating
to be told I'm "one of the boys" and
expected to take it as an unshaded
compliment. I take it as a fact. Just
like I take my status as a woman
as a fact, not a condition in need
of remedy.
The prevailing culture in STEM
fields isn't inherently invaluable.
However, the expectation that to be
relevant as women we must fill a cer-
tain role is not only marginalizing,
but also defeating of a main tenant
of engineering philosophy. As scien-
tists, we seek innovation and value
global perspectives and diverse opin-
ions as essential to growth.
So, if you want to show up to your
thermodynamics class in heels and a
dress, rock it out. Take yourself seri-
ously, because defining yourself as
feminine shouldn't be stigmatized.
To everybody else, recognize that we
look fly as hell and move on.

ing the majority voices, but by ele-
vating the minority ones. When the

school and its students.
While the university "will participate as
a minority investor alongside other venture
capital and angel investors," it's Stanford's first
attempt to make money from entrepreneurs
coming out of the university. The fund will
support the operations of StartX, and what's
called the "entrepreneurial education pro-
gram" which can essentially invest any amount
of money in a company. However, Stanford
also received criticism when it became public
knowledge that some professors would invest
in their own students' companies, a clear con-
flict of interest.
The Stanford-StartX fund is particularly
helpful due to the typically high barriers to
entry in the ultra-competitive tech industry
of Silicon Valley. StartX has helped to create
a number of successful companies, including
MedWhat, a search engine that allows users
to ask questions regarding health or medical
problems. If other universities invest in such
programs, they should establish guidelines in
order to ensure the academic and educational
priorities. If a university-backed program
encourages students to drop out to pursue a
business opportunity it would be contradictory
to the principles of an academic institution.
Stanford has garnered controversy regard-
ing their focus on entrepreneurship due to a
concern over whether these types of initiatives
detract from education and create pressure on
students who are not interested in startups.

There are also ethical questions that come
about when a university invests funds in com-
panies founded by undergraduates. Conflicts
of interest may arise when the university has a
profit-making agenda over its students. Recent
Stanford alumni have suggested that the inten-
tions of these start-ups have shifted from solv-
ing world problems to founding companies for
the prestige of owning a successful startup.
Universities looking to fund student-led start-
ups should carefully screen whether students
are dedicated to having an impact.
Here at the University, student, faculty and
administrators alike have been pushing for
more entrepreneurial opportunities on cam-
pus. OptiMize is a program that offers fund-
ing to startups that combine entrepreneurship
with social service, furthering the University's
principles while encouraging student initia-
tive. Startup Academy by MPowered Entrepre-
neurship hosts a series of sessions on coding
languages and starting a business taught by
successful entrepreneurs or professors, while
providing networking opportunities for every-
one involved. While the increased emphasis on
entrepreneurship is noteworthy here in Ann
Arbor - even getting a shout-out in the White
House's blog - the University should take note
from Stanford's model. An increased access
to responsible funding for student businesses
is key to keeping students competitive in an
already competitive field.

C'mon, Common Core

ver the past few months, the
Michigan state legislature
has been carefully deliber-
ating over the
implementation
of a nationwide
education initia-
tive known as
Common Core
State Standards.
Since 2010, 45
states - includ-
ing Michigan - JAKE
have adopted the OFFENHARTZ
standard, and of
those 45, the vast
majority has either implemented the
program or plans to do so by 2014.
While the Michigan Department
of Education adopted the policy in
2011, in June 2013, a coalition of con-
servative lawmakers successfully
blocked the funding needed to imple-
ment the policy. Led by state Rep.
Tom McMillin, these conservatives
have spent much of the summer gar-
nering support for their cause.
The debate over Common Core is
complex and of of huge importance.
With the budget going into effect
on Oct. 1, it's a time-sensitive issue
as well. But while the congressio-
nal battle may be nuanced, it's clear
that education reform is desperately
needed in Michigan.
First, let's agree that secondary
education in the United States is not
where we'd like it to be. According
to Organization for Economic, Co-
operationand Development polls, the
United States is now ranked 22nd in
high-school graduation rates among
27 industrialized nations - a sta-
tistic in which we once held the top
spot. If country-to-country compari-
sons seem irrelevant or arbitrary, it's
worth noting that, according to the
National Assessment of Educational
Progress, every two out of three
eighth graders can't read proficiently,
while three of four can't write profi-
ciently. This is far from ideal.
Second, let's agree on some broad
solutions to the problem of depreci-

ating educational quality: e

Core can be an alternative to for-

Child Left Behind legislation - an
act widely condemned among edu-
cators - and not an extension of it.
While Common Core is similar to
NCLB by awarding federal money to
schools that meet certain standards,
the scope of those standards and
method of assessing them varies
greatly between the two initiatives.
For one, Common Core is a state-
led initiative and addresses a major
criticism of NCLB - that national,
uniform standards would create a
one-size-fits-all curriculum. On the
contrary, Common Core is a set of

tion. The standards won't pay our
teachers more, they won't eliminate
the woes of poverty on our schools
and they probably won't make
American kids smarter than their
Japanese counterparts.
They will, however, provide our
educational system with a path
toward much-needed reform. If they
fail to restore the funds necessary to
implement Common Core, Michigan
lawmakers are ignoring the recom-
mendation of teachers and, above all
else, the needs of students.

The collected fees will go toward
the estimated $1.55-million, three-
year pilot cost, according to the CEC.
There will be 14 stations - accom-
modating a total of 125 bikes - dur-
ing the pilot phase. The CEC and Ann
Arbor are jointly covering $750,000
in initial costs, while the University
will provide $600,000 toward the
$800,000 estimated operational costs.
Usage fees are expected to cover the
$200,000 difference.
Initially planned to launch fall 2013,
Dolen said the program should hope-
fully come to fruition in April. If the
electrical and siting requirements
are not worked out before the winter,
however, Dolen said the program's
start date could be pushed back to
summer 2014.
"There's all kinds of hurdles, and
that's probably why we're a little fur-
ther from implementation than we
originally wanted to be," he said.
CEC hired B-cycle, a bicycle shar-
ing company that has operations in
18 U.S. cities, to provide the stations,
bicycles and operating systems. The
14 stations will house six to 12 "blue
bikes" fashioned with a front basket,
automatic front and rear lights, chain
lock and internal RFID and GPS. The
GPS enables B-cycle to record data
on member and bike usage, including
location.
B-cycle's website allows users to
track distance, duration, calories
burned and carbon offset during
bike rides. It also has a section titled
"B-effect," which can calculate energy
and cost savings of bicycle usage in a
given community.
Aaron Champion, CEC project man-
ager and coordinator for the Detroit
area, said with Ann Arbor's size, all 14
locations would be located between a
quarter-mile and a half-mile of each
other.
"The literature has been pretty clear
in showing that, especially with bus
stops and transit stops, people aren't
really inclined to walk more than a
quarter-mile," Champion said.
Stations will primarily be located
downtown and on Central Campus -
with a single station on North Campus
- and will provide service to both stu-
dent and resident markets.
"That's the beautiful thing -

because the University of Michigan is
a truly urban campus, there is no dis-
tinction as far as the stations are con-
cerned," Champion said. "You're going
to get excellent coverage for both of
those markets."
The University of Colorado-Boul-
der, which has also partnered with
B-cycle, provided a blueprint for CEC
in decisions regarding Ann Arbor's
program, as the square mileage, popu-
lation and climate of the two cities are
roughly comparable.
According to a press release from
Boulder's B-cycle branch, the Boulder
bike share program began with 12 sta-
tions and 100 bikes back in 2011, and
will have an additional 20 stations by
the end of fall 2013. Boulder B-cycle
estimates that 50 stations, for a total of
500 bikes, would allow for a sustain-
able bike-share system.
But similarity does not guarantee
success, as the University learned
during its first bike-sharing attempt
in the '80s. Ann Arbor resident Bill
Loy, who has been the owner of the
long-standing Campus Student Bike
Shop for 50 years, remembers the
time clearly.
"They tried that once already," Loy
said. "It was called a 'Green Bike.'
They just trashed them."
"Green Bike" was a failed campus
initiative where a fleet of green bikes
was placed at various locations across
campus for student use, Loy said. But
without locks or maintenance, the
green bikes disappeared or rusted
away.
"There's too much on bikes - I've
been at it a long time - too much
maintenance," Loy said. "They need
service. I have 300 rentals, and I have
to service them all the time."
"It'll wreck my business," he added.
But 30 years later, the CEC's plan
is more elaborate, and students seem
supportive. LSA sophomore Lea Ono,
who can't transport her bike from her
home in New York sees the bike pro-
gram as a solution to an out-of-state
problem.
"I'm not the only one in this situa-
tion, a lot of out-of-state students feel
the same way, or international stu-
dents," Ono said. "I think I would use
it. I would want to bike for fall (and)
spring."
"My only concern is storing a bike
and with a bike share program, you
don't have to worry about that," she
added.

Event coordinator Heather Mozes, an
administrative assistant in the office of
the executive vice president and chief
financial officer, said the group tried to
invite as many internal vendors for the
event as possible. Volunteers came from
multiple University institutions, includ-
ing the Kellogg Eye Center and the School
of Dentistry.
"We couldn't have asked for a better
day to kick off fall and let everyone know
what we're about," Mozes said. "A lot of
faculty, staff and students aren't aware
of what we have here, with the eye cen-
ter and dentistry, Rec Sports and physi-
cal medicine. The fact that we can spread
that around is really great."
Mozes said it canbe difficult to main-
tain wellness in college and beyond, but
hopes events like these will be helpful
in their choice to prioritize healthy liv-
ing.

routine of something, like getting enough
water or remembering to exercise, then
it's hard, especially when you don't exact-

schools across the state. The program is
the result of collaboration between the
University, health insurer Blue Cross
Blue Shield of Michigan, Wayne State
University, the Michigan Fitness Foun-
dation and the United Dairy Industry of
Michigan.
The program is intended to reverse
Michigan's growing obesity problem.
About 26 percent of Michigan adoles-
cents are overweight or obese, according
to a report from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
Internal medicine Prof. Kim Eagle
is the co-founder of Project Healthy
Schools, which has been working with
local middle schools since 2004. He said
the program is designed to make cafete-
ria food healthier, limit the availability
of junk food and sugary beverages in
vending machines and encourage exer-
cise.
"For each school, we develop enrich-
ment programs that may focus on
walking clubs, volleyball programs

ly know what's offered," she said. "This is
a way of making these resources available
and sharing our lifestyle with everyone
else."
Wednesday was the second day in
three days of events that MHealthy is
hosting this week. On Tuesday, the area
surrounding the Modern Languages
Building looked more like a carnival than
a college campus, as MHealthy teamed
up with Rec Sports and other University
organizations to host a Play Day event. As
opposed to the Health and Wellness Fair,
this event emphasized exercise.
Many students and faculty were seen
taking a break between class and meet-
ings to partake in activities including
hopscotch, Frisbee golf, hula hooping
competitions and an inflatable obstacle
course.
"People think exercise has to be drudg-
ery, but it so does not," Colleen Greene,
an MHealthy senior wellness coordina-
tor said. "We have a lot of activities, so
there's definitely something for everyone;
if you get them having fun they won't
even know they're doing something good
for them."
Greene estimated that several hundred
people participated throughout the day.
In celebration of its 100th birthday this

Thursday, September 19, 2013 - 5A
year, Rec Sports encouraged people to do
100 repetitions of any type of physical
activity, such as lunges, sit-ups or jump-
ing jacks.
"We're trying to get involved in all
kinds of events as we celebrate this mile-
stone of keeping students and staff in
shape with physical activity," Jon Swerd-
low, senior assistant director of Rec
Sports said. "Exercise helps your brain
and helps you in all ways, especially when
you're busy because it keeps you sharper,
you sleep better, and are emotionally,
mentally and physically better."
Swerdlow said involvement had been
"non-stop" and people seemed excited
about the midday opportunity to get
active.
LSA freshman Bianka Kristen stopped
by the event and made a beeline for the
obstacle course after class.
"It's nice to be outside after being
inside all day and sitting around a lot, so
this was a fun way to do that," Christen
said. "It's one of those things that even
when you're busy you have to want to
make time for exercise because it's so
important."
MHealthy is hosting another Play Day
event tomorrow in front of the University
Hospital from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.


or creating a school garden to further
enrich the experience for middle school-
ers," Eagle said.
This is the first year for Building
Healthy Communities, which works
with middle schools of associated with
Project Healthy Schools and adds ele-
mentary schools. Eagle said the collabor-
ative strategy was made possible by their
partners modeling elementary-school
programs off Project Healthy School's
established plan for middle schools.
"Our health system has created a
model that other health systems in the
state ... want to emulate, where they give
back to their communities through a
very clear activity that is working with
schools to try to create healthier envi-
ronments and educational messaging to
improve the health of our youth," Eagle
said.
Eagle said the program's main focus
is on low-income areas, which often lack
options for residents to buy nutritious
food at affordable prices.
"The (obesity) rate is particularly
high in lower-income communities
where the resources or access say to
fresh foods and vegetables through

typical grocery stores or the access to
safe recreational facilities and/or pro-
grams are reduced because of financial
pressure," he said.
Eagle said the 28 schools were chosen
based more on a "keen willingness" to
implement the initiative rather than any
concrete criteria.
St. Thomas the Apostle in Ann Arbor
is the only school within Washtenaw
County to be a beneficiary of the pro-
gram.
Eagle said the program's administra-
tors are working on achieving funding
self-sufficiency within a few years. Once
initial set-up costs have been covered
and volunteers have been trained to run
the educational programs, he antici-
pates upkeep costs will be minimal.
"All the evidence and data show that
when children are healthier, they are
more likely to succeed in the classroom
and beyond," said Registered dietician
Shannon Carney Oleksyk, an advisor
for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.
"These programs encourage children
to make healthy choices at a young age,
laying the foundation for a healthier,
stronger Michigan future."

After Sweet 16 berth,
tennis starts anew

The Wolverines
return their singles
lineup and adds
strong recruits
By JASON RUBENSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's
tennis team is eyeing a fresh
start. Despite getting ousted
by UCLA in last year's NCAA
Sweet 16, the Wolverines return
their entire singles lineup while
adding a star-studded recruit-
ing class.
The rejuvenated lineup faces
its first test when it plays in this
weekend's Wolverine Invita-
tional. Michigan will face Notre
Dame, DePaul, Tulane, Purdue
and Arizona State in a mixture
of singles and doubles.
Sitting atop the lineup is
junior Emina Bektas, who is
ranked No. 25 in the preseason
ITA poll. Bektas was voted to
the All-Big Ten first team and
changed her summer routine to

Bolender: "I'm very impressed
with the freshmen. They came
in knowing that they were
freshmen, but at the same time
knowing they were a big part of
the team. We need our fresh-
men to contribute as much as
everyone else, and they've come
in strong."
Michigan especially needs its
freshmen to step up in the dou-
bles game. The Wolverines tried
many different pairings last
season but couldn't consistently
produce at the bottom spots.
Bektas and Bolender were often
the only duo to secure victories
at dual meets, and their success
earned them a No. 3 ranking in
the preseason poll.
But despite the ranking, the
two might not be partners.
"We actually don't know
if we are even going to play
together," Bolender said. "We
need to put out three of our best
doubles teams, whether or not
Emina and I are together. The
coaches haven't decided yet."
Splitting the pair would
mean losing out on a one-of-a-

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
Senior midfielder Meghan Toohey said Michigan's first loss of the season, against Butler, won't be forgotten. "We don't ever want to feel like that," she said.
Rynmay make change~s a after 1st loss

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer
A month ago, life was good for
the Michigan women's soccer
team and its coach, Greg Ryan.
The Wolverines rolled off 6-1
and 3-0 wins and were all smiles
after the games. Nearly every
player on the roster saw action.
Ryan sat cheerfully on the shaded
bench after games - "my new
office," he called it.
Sunday, Butler hit Michigan
with something it hadn't seen
before - a loss. Now it must
respond.
"We're not going to forget
that loss," said senior midfielder
Meghan Toohey. "(We'll) know
just what it feels like. We don't
ever want to feel like that."
The Wolverines have talked for
weeks about a Big Ten title, which
Penn State has won for 15 seasons
in a row. The conference schedule
begins Sunday at Iowa.
"If we were going to face
adversity or have a loss, the But-
ler game was the game to do it,"
said junior defender Chloe Sos-

enko. "It's something that we're
not going to forget."
The loss on Sunday in India-
napolis wasn't the kind of game
the Wolverines were used to. The
Bulldogs sat back in a five-defend-
er formation and kept Michigan
out of the box.
"To be honest, I think the
tough part was just that they
threw something at us tactically
that we haven't seen before,"
Ryan said.
Butler scored late in the first
half on a counterattack, and it
wasn't the kind of goal the Wol-
verines were used to. It was an
uncharacteristic goal, one in
which Ryan said "five players
(made) mistakes, all on the same
play."
Ryan kept his hands off the
leadership and let his players
carry the team to its best start
ever. Now, heading into the Big
Ten season, he may have to make
some changes. He said he will
talk this week with a few players
who have not been performing up
to their potential.
"It's up to the players coming

off the bench," Ryan said. "If they
can perform at a really high level,
I'll continue to use the bench. If
they can't perform at a high level
in the Big Ten season, you'll see a
smaller lineup."
This season, Ryan has men-
tioned depth as one of Michi-
gan's strengths, but as the games
become more important, he will
consider playing his starters more
as necessary.
Other than a one-goal deficit
against San Diego State on Sept.
1, this is the only true adversity
the Wolverines have faced. With
another deficit seemingly inevi-
table at some point during the Big
Ten season, Michigan may have
to get used to these battles.
"Our team has tended to get
frustrated when things aren't
going as planned for us," Toohey
said. "It's a mindset, knowing
we're good enough to do it."
The Wolverines, who moved
down to No. 15 in this week's Top
25, will need to rebound quickly
before heading to Iowa (8-0). The
Hawkeyes, though undefeated,
have not beaten any teams receiv-

ing votes in this week's poll and
have not finished above .500 since
2002.
After a six-game homestand to
open the season, Sosenko antici-
pates a difficult atmosphere in
Michigan's second straight road
game.
"We haven't won on the road,
so we'll need to prove to ourselves
that we can win on the road,"
Sosenko said. "We're not play-
ing against the other team. We're
playing against them, the refs, the
fans and the field."
If the Wolverines do battle
back and open the Big Ten sea-
son with a win Sunday, the But-
ler defeat could be looked at as a
good loss.
"We would love that to hap-
pen," Toohey said. "This could
be a game that refocuses us and
relights our fire, or it could be
a snowball into (more losses).
We're going to channel that into
lighting the fire."
Needing to light a fire is not
a situation Michigan has found
itself in this season. Still, they
have to adjust.

refine her craft.
"Mostly this summer, I tried
to stay in a competitive shape
by playing tournaments," Bek-
tas said. "Last summer, I didn't
do a good job of that and being
in competitive matches is some-
thing you can't just practice."
Sophomore Ronit Yurovsky
should also make an impact.
The reigning Big TenFreshman
of the Year saw time at the No. 1
slot, and with Bektas, forms one
of the strongest one-two punch-
es in the country.
But don't count out the three
newcomers. Sara Remynse, a
five-star recruit according to
TennisRecruiting.net, high-
lights the freshmen class. The
Richland, Mich., native is the
No. 31 player in the nation.
Joining Remynse are Colom-
bia native Laura Ucros and
Annie Weirda from Holland,
Mich. And all of them are
already making themselves
known in practice.
"The freshmen have been
great," Bektas said. "They have
really provided a new aspect.

chemistry with us already."

kind, aggressive strategy that
has led to success in college,
but also at the professional level
as well. The duo won a doubles
futures event in Evansville,
Ind., this summer.
However, this weekend will
allow coach Ronni Bernstein to
toy with all types of combina-
tions in order to find that per-
feet lineup.
Highlighting the competi-
tion this weekend is Notre
Dame's Brittany Sanders, who
has given Bektas a difficult time
in the past. The two players
split their matches last year.
But Bektas has a game plan.
"I do need to continue to
work on my defensive game
and play those longer points,"
Bektas said. "But if that's what
I'm doing the whole match, I'm
probably going to be in trouble,
so using my forehand and get-
ting in is what I need to do."
This weekend will provide
the Wolverines a chance to see
new competition and allow
them to figure out their team's
identity.
Who will play in each spot?
Only time will tell, and this
weekend is just the beginning
of a long road.

Juniors will lead
team with 11
newcomers and a
lot of potential
By REBECCA DZOMBAK
For TheDaily
Juniors Brook Handler and
Taylor Pogue, the new captains
of the No. 17 Michigan women's
cross country team, thought
they'd take the first mile easy
and let Purdue set the pace at
the Michigan Open on Aug. 30.
But when Purdue hung
back, Michigan sprang at the
opportunity. Handler, Pogue
and sophomore Shannon Osika
formed a tight pack and didn't
look back, dominating with a
strong one-two-three finish
within a. 40-second window.
Both Handler and Pogue said
that the Michigan Open served
as a great kickoff for the sea-
son. The girls were strong, hun-
gry and ready to go after their
preseason camp at the end of
August.
"It was a good race," Pogue
said. "We were feeling really
good after camp, and we fin-
ished really strong - stron-
ger than we started, which is
always good."
Two weeks later, at the Pur-
due Invitational, Pogue took
her first collegiate win. So what
got Handler and Pogue to the
rank of captain?
For Handler, it was adhering
closely to what Michigan coach
Mike McGuire had to say.
"All the little things add up
eventually," she said. "It's just
a matter of adopting that set of
values as your own."
Handler feels she's done this
well. Pogue believes tha hter
leadership skills came from
having strong captains her,
freshman and sophomore years.
"I think they did a really
good job of leading the team
and giving us advice," Pogue
said. "They served as really
great examples of how to bal-

ance academics with our ath-
letics."
As for leadership styles,
the women agree that they
will complement each other
well. The performance of the
team as a whole is their first
priority, although individual
performance is important as
well. Handler said that Pogue
is more "motherly and affec-
tionate," whereas she tends to
take a slightly more aggressive
approach. But there is little
doubt that they will work well
together and be strong leaders
for the season.
Both captains have been hon-
ored multiple times by the Big
Ten for their academic achieve-
ments. Pogue is studying soci-
ology, while Handler studies
chemical engineering.
"It's a definitely difficult pro-
gram, but I see myself as hav-
ing an advantage being on the
team," Handler said. "We work
together, we study on the bus....
If I'm not feeling motivated and
I look over and see someone
plugging away on their calcu-
lus, that helps me get motivat-
ed."
Motivation shouldn't be an
issue for anyone this year. Pre-
season camp was a huge confi-
dence and energy booster; the
captains said, and gave them
a good preview of what the
season may look like. With 11
freshmen, there's a lot of new
blood - and potential - on
the team. Pogue and Handler
agreed that the freshmen are
a well-rounded and extremely
talented group and are excited
to see them compete.
One in particular, Erin Finn,
stood out to both at the Michi-
gan Open when she took a risk
and started out really strong at
her first collegiate race. Han-
dler described her as "a great
recruit."
"She's had great high-school
success, and we're really excit-
ed to have her," Handler said.
The women's cross country
team next races Oct. 5 at the
Rim Rock Farm Classic in Law-
rence, Kan.

games is an impressive feat for
anyone. You could call it being a
smart player or you could call it
beinglucky.
Or, in the case of the Michigan
football team, you could call it
the return of Blake Countess.
After sustaining a season-end-
ing knee injury in the opening
game of the Michigan football
team's 2012 campaign, the red-
shirt sophomore cornerback is
back in full form for the Wolver-
ines' secondary.
"There's some times where
you see (Countess) just a lot
tighter on a guy," said defen-
sive coordinator Greg Mattison.
"That comes from having confi-
dence. I mean, for Blake to come
back from a whole year off and to
do what he's doing, I'm pleased

with that."
It's agood thing Mattison feels
that way considering Countess
still doesn't have his position
solidified. He's currently rotat-
ing between cornerback and
nickel. It sounds more complicat-
ed than it is - Countess has no
difficulty remembering to switch
mindsets at a moment's notice.
"I asked if I could learn the
nickel position in the spring,"
Countess said. "I always see the
nickel as always around the ball
because they have that freedom.
That was one thing that I liked,
and I pursued it and it just so
happened that I fell into the
starting role."
If Countess' injury gave him
anything, it was time to decide
that nickel was a position he
wanted to try. In between his
sometimes twice-weekly rehab
sessions last year, Countess spent
the remainder of his time study-

ing film. He took notice of the
aggression associated with the
nickel position and decided that
was a place he could see himself
fitting in.
In between rehab and decid-
ing to take on the nickel posi-
tion, Countess found other ways
to fill his time during his injury.
With a handful of other injured
Wolverines, Countess watched
Michigan games from the com-
fort of his dorm room, where his
teammates demanded he act as
an extra set of eyes.
Former Michigan cornerback
J.T. Floyd insisted that Countess
text him throughout the course
of the game with every little
thing that he noticed.
"J.T. told me, 'If you don't text
me at halftime, you're going to
hear from me and you're not
going to like what you hear,"'
Countess said. "(He) took my
advice with open arms."

As far as the knee, Countess
doesn't even notice it anymore.
Over the summer, redshirt junior
quarterback Devin Gardner
dared Countess to do some back
flips, a little homage to Count-
ess's past as a gymnast.
Countess accepted Gardner's
bet, just to prove he could - as
he says, he wanted to "push the
limits."
He successfully performed the
back flips. And though Countess
is hesitant to say his knee is back
to where it was before the sur-
gery, he acknowledges that it's
different, in a good way.
"Once you get out there and
really start flying, (the knee
is) the last thing I'm think-
ing about," he said. "I haven't
thought about it in forever. Every
so often I'll go in and do some
tune-up rehab but that's just to
stay on top of things."



'M' parasails and dribbles through Europe WE KINDA LIKE YOU.

Michigan women's basketball
coach Kim Barnes Arico loves
Ann Arbor. Among other things,
she loves the weather, the school
spirit and, of course, her team.
But after spending 10 days in
Europe, Ann Arbor seems bleak
by comparison.
"I now call Ann Arbor home,"
Barnes Arico said. "But boy was
that trip incredible."
Thanks to super fan Nancy
Lohr, the Wolverines had the
opportunity to travel to France
and Italy for the first foreign trip
in program history.
"I honestly can't say enough
about it," Barnes Arico said. "I've
been coaching for a long time,
and this was the first time that
I've done a foreign trip.
"I don't really know if I ever
want to do (a trip) again because
I don't think it could ever top
the experience that we had. I
just think part of the reason it
was so incredible was the people
that were there. Our kids were so
appreciative and just incredible.
They're truly Michigan kids, and
they really valued the experience.
Plus, our chemistry was terrific."
The team left Aug. 19 and
started in Paris where Michigan
visited the Louvre and the Eiffel
Tower while also taking a river
cruise down the Seine. On Aug.
22, the team took a train to Nice,
France, and made trips to Mona-
co and Lake Como the next day.
Barnes Arico pointed to Nice
as one of the best spots. There,
she went parasailing, while the
team went on a banana boat, and
everyone had the opportunity to
swim in the Mediterranean Sea.
The Wolverines' first stop in
Italy was Florence before they
headed to Rome. There, the team
hit the top tourist spots like the
Piazza Novana, Pantheon, Span-
ish Steps and the Trevi Fountain.

Coach Kim Barnes Arico and the Michigan women's baskethall team mono sent to turope hy super fan Nancy Lohr.

Michigan then visited the Coli-
seum and the Roman Forum. The
trip concluded with a visit to the
Vatican, the Sistine Chapel and
St. Peter's Basilica.
"Each place was a little bit dif-
ferent, and you got to experience
something different in each place
that we went," Barnes Arico said.
"The Coliseum and the Vatican
were great," Barnes Arico said. "I
mean just such rich history and
tradition, architecture, it was just
phenomenal. I don't have a favor-
ite, the trip was my favorite."
It wasn't all sightseeing for
the Wolverines, who also played
three games while overseas.
In its first game, against AMW
France, Michigan played two
strong halves of basketball to
easily defeat its first interna-
tional opponent, 102-34. Fresh-
i

man guard Siera Thompson led
the team with 23 points, five
rebounds, three assists and two
steals.
The Wolverines played their
next two games in Italy, first
beating the Italian All-Stars, 112-
37, before trouncing StellaAzzur-
ra, 117-15, three days later.
"I thought it really helped
our program especially being so
young and inexperienced like we
will be next year," Barnes Arico
said. "It gave us an opportunity to
get some people on the court, give
them a little bit of confidence, and
really give an opportunity for
everyone, myself included, to get
to know each other off the court."
Despite coming off one of its
best seasons in program his-
tory, when Michigan tied a pro-
gram record with 22 wins and

advanced to the second round of
the NCAA Tournament, Barnes
Arico has a young team to work
with. The Wolverines are an
unknown coming into the season
- they welcome four newcomers
as well as four players returning
from anterior cruciate ligament
injuries who didn't see the court
last season.
The foreign trip also allowed
the Wolverines to have 10 extra
practice days prior to departure.
"We have one player on our
roster that's returning that
played over 10 minutes a game,
possibly two, (sophomore guard)
Madison (Ristovski) and (senior T"
forward) Nicole (Elmblad)," Learn your potential

In 2012, Gardner never threw

f you were in Ann Arbor this
spring and summer, you might
have seen a painting or two hang-
ing around - not just in the Univer-
sity of Michigan Museum of Art or at
the Art Fair, but on the sides of res-
taurants, at the Fire Department and
peeking out of alleyways. For a few
months, Ann Arbor was a museum all
its own. Thanks to the Detroit Insti-
tute of Art's InsidelOut program, high
reproductions of Matisse, Sargent,
Church and other artists featured in
the DIA's galleries decorated the city
streets.
Kerrytown Market & Shops, fit-
tingly, had on show Il Pensionante
del Saraceni's "The Fruit Vendor,"
an early Baroque piece depicting a
woman haggling with a man at his
fruit stand. Installations of paint-
ings like these were made possible
through a partnership between the
Ann Arbor Public Art Commission
and the DIA. The museum ap-
proached the commission during the
fall of 2012 during its search for new
Michigan communities likely to have
an interest in participating. Ann Arbor
agreed to be one of the 13 cities to do
so, and Artemsia Genileschi's "Judith
and Her Maidservant," among six
other reproductions, was installed in
Ann Arbor. City residents were also
given free admission to the museum
during a "community weekend," so
they could see the original pieces.

This one goes out to
Khloe Kardashian

baked.buzzed.bored.
in this new series, three daily arts writers
in varying states of mind visit the same
place and write about their experiences.
this week's destination:
St. Jerome's Laneway Music Festival

By LENA FINKEL
Daily Gossip Columnist
Here's to you, Khlod Kar-
dashian.
Lamar Odom's in
rehab. He's not in rehab. He's a
cheater. And a liar. And the biggest
drug addict on the planet - bigger
than Lindsay Lohan. Yup, once
you get caught up in the whirl-
wind of gossip, it's pretty much
impossible to stop it. Too bad
Odom seems to be trapped in that
tornado. But the only thing worse
than being Odom right now?
Being his wife, KhloI.
Based on what the public
knows, Khlod has done abso-
lutely nothing wrong - other than
marry a troubled man, of course.
Yet she must face the constant
stream of gossip, the pestering
of the paparazzi and the news
headlines around the web. Every
day, more rumors come about,
each more ridiculous than the
last (How many girls did Odom
supposedly cheat on Khlo6 with?
Is it up to five now?). And this is
all while her seemingly flawless
sisters enjoy the picture-perfect
family life with their boyfriends
and babies.
But Khlo6 has long been por-
trayed as different from her sis-
ters. Some call her the black sheep
of the Kardashian clan, others call
her the "ugly sister" (how mean!).
But let's call her what she really is:
unlucky.
When Kim books multiple-page
spreads in OK! Magazine, Khloe
gets fired as the host of "X Factor:
U.S." While all of her sisters rock
nearly perfect bodies (I mean,
little sister Kendall is a model, for

goodness sake!), Khlod sticks out
like a sore thumb. And though
her sister Kourtney has one of the
mostrepulsiveboyfriends around
- c'mon, does anyone like Scott
Disick? - even she isn't facing all
this drama.
Khlod has long been the other
Kardashian sister, but I think we
all know a few "Khlods" in our
life. We've all seen that sorority
girl who tries to fit into clothes
two sizes too small just to look like
her sisters or have had that friend
who always seems to get upstaged,
even on her birthday.

success right, she could definitely
end up being a greatrole model
(That means no more DUIs!).
She could reallybe something
to young girls with body image
issues or girls who are having
trouble fitting in. But she needs to
play her cards right.
And Khloe's starting to do just
that. She began with her blogand
used it to open up about her expe-
riences getting bullied. She's since
moved on to bigger platforms, like
her appearances on "E! News" and
her interviews in Cosmopolitan

I wasn't high when I entered the festival and got the photo pass from the
media booth while holding no camera equipment whatesover on my body,
and I wasn't high when Youth Lagoon, with the mystic-blanket-covered key-
boards and ombrl-haired Trevor Powers, made Paul and Harrison show the
first signs of life in the festival's crowd - bouncing up and down like embodi-

Who knew that two puffs of a joint (when held in the lungs for an exagger-
ated span to take in every last particle of THC) could actually get a frequent
smoker a little fucked up. But yeah, here I am now at CHYRCHES jamming
out and falling in love with the cute leadsinger and every semi-attractive hip-
ster girl within a visible range of distance. Later, Kayla and I are jamming the
fuck out to Icona Pop, occupying our own dance stage in one of the pavilion
rows. My body movements are displayingto everyone a nice, Look you hoes, I

and I'm not that high, butI nonetheless drift into an apocalyptic vision of ter-
rifyingly vague faces surrounded by devastating strings and nonsense emo-
tion words and I start to feel anxiety creep into my consciousness. Afterward,
when the high starts to wear off, my throat opens up again to allow oxygen
into the system as I float through a set from The National that I would appreci-

Detroit is a lotcgreener than I remember. More hipsters, too. But whatever,
I'm here with approximately the entire population of Kerrytown, and I'm
ready to get my festival on. Hold up - $10 for shitty beer? WHY. Oh well, give
me three, please.
NO ONE IS DANCING? But we are. WHY ISN'T ANYONE ELSE DANC-
ING? I don't want to be dramatic, but I think Warpaint just stole my heart.
But wait, now Alunageorge has my heart. She's wearing DIMEPIECE. And a
sports bra that says "Baby Girl" on it?!! Andrew gives her a 4/10 so I send him
17 knife emojis.
We pause for a brief intermission so Emily can braid my hair whilst we sit
on these hay couches. Who invented hay couches? I want to high-five you.
J.L. and I are the only members of our group going to Icona Pop because
everyone else is a hater, I guess. BUT MAN THEY ARE MISSING OUT. We
are still the only people dancing because Laneway attendees did not get the
memo to go hard today methinks. That's OK! J.L. and I are basically a side-
show during this Icona Pop set which is killer btw. Aino is wearing a metal-
lic silver maxi dress (!!!) and Caroline is in high-waisted leather shorts and a
red+black leather jacket - I need to tell Instagram! Now it's Solange o'clock,
and homegirl is a hundo-percent killin'it. Did she just point at me?SOLANGE
JUST POINTED AT ME.
Flume tho.
K.G.R. says no one is allowed to talk about Sigur Ros because Sigur Ros
makes him feel too many feels.
If I were to summarize Laneway in an emoji, it would definitely be the
dancing twins. Or the dancing tango lady. Or the hearts-in-eyes cat.All of the
above.

Your first time is always a little awkward. Things are too big, things
are too small and no one knows where anything is for sure. For its first
go in the United States, St. Jerome's Laneway Music Festival had all
the markings of a first-timer. The music festival started in Melbourne,
Australia and most recently added Detroit as its eighth location.
The inaugural experience, highlighted by performances by Sigur Ros
and the National, was intimate to say the least. With only about 7,500
attendees, the comfort of easily spotting friends was outweighed by
the awkwardness of tiny crowds at many of the acts. Solange and Icona
Pop, two energetic shows by great performers, were made low-key by
the enormous Meadow Brook pavilion dwarfing and spreading out the
crowd.
Sometimes space is good - but for shows that are about jumping
around and letting your 19-year-old drunk girl out, something is just
off. This is to be expected with the first U.S. attempt, and sobriety
certainly didn't take the edge off the awkward. Note to self: Never see
Sigur Ros sober. Ever.

Tree Town grows with
new art installation

Leaving my
phone behind

Catherine Widgery
chosen to spearhead
latest AAPC project
By ANNA SADOVSKAYA
SeniorArts Editor
Naturally garnished with big
burrs and ornamental oaks, Ann
Arbor's "Tree Town" nickname
is appropriate, given the nearly
50,000 trees lining its streets.
Struck by the vast presence of
mature trees within Nichols Arbo-
retum and throughout the rest of
Ann Arbor, artist Catherine Widg-
ery designed an art installation set
to decorate the East Stadium Bou-
levard bridges and underpass.
The search for an artist was
conducted through the Ann Arbor
Public Arts Committee, which
sanctioned a set budget for the
public-art project.
"Usually what happens is (the
committee) sends out a call to art-
ists when we have a project idea or
alocation in which the commission
has selected to put an art project
in," said Public Art Administra-
tor Aaron Seagraves. "We review
them based on the criteria of the
project goals, evaluate the artists
based on qualifications."
From there, three or four art-
ists' concept designs are chosen
as finalists and after interviews
and closer inspections of design
attributes, one artist is selected.
The committee, made up of stake-
holders and community members,
elected Massachusetts designer
Catherine Widgery to undertake

the project.
"I think with this particular
proposal, it used a lot of the area
that we were hoping to place art-
work in," Seagraves said. "The
theme of using imagery of trees
and placing them in a transpar-
ent background, on glass, using
acrylic, so it's see-through, I
think it was the theme that really
struck people."
Having completed close to 40
public art installations across the
United States and Canada, Wid-
gery is no newcomer to the art
scene. Her interest in environ-
mental sculptures and infusing
nature into art led her to a career
involving public installations.
"Public art puts art in the pub-
lic spaces and in an environment
where it's not a museum," Sea-
graves said. "It can be enjoyed
by a lot more people, viewed by
a wider audience. What I think
public art does, when it's really
successful, is identify a particu-
lar spot or area, and lends an
identity to an area."
Along with lending an iden-
tity, public art creates a common
culture for the community and
distinguishes a city from others.
The Rock, on the corner of Hill
Street and Washtenaw Avenue,
is a notable Ann Arbor landmark
that unites the city's inhabitants
through a paint-based tradition.
"It's not public art in the sense
that it's an art sculpture, but it's a
participatory type of art project,"
Seagraves said.
Though arts funding has
been kept up in Ann Arbor, many
municipalities and institutions in

the United States have seen cuts
and decreases in their resources.
But Widgery calls to mind success-
ful art installations that gave pur-
pose and notability to an area, like
Millenium Park in Chicago.
"I think people underestimate
the financial as well as the aes-
thetic aspect of art," Widgery said.
"I'm a great believer that it really
contributes to the quality of life in
the town."
Her own project, "Arbor
Winds," aims to do just that.
Without giving too much away,
Widgery explained that it will be
situated on the East Stadium Bou-
levard bridges and feature tree-
inspired prints on pieces of glass
and a larger, more immersive
installation at the passageway.
"There's the underpass and
then the raised elements that
will be all along the bridge, so
that when people drive over
them there will be colorful
points of animation across the
bridge, and a larger work right
at the entrance," Widgery said.
"It's still in development, but
it's exciting to feel there's this
give-and-take, back-and-forth
exchange based on all the public
feedback that there was."
Though the feedback allows
for the project to grow, it also
makes pinning down an exact
design difficult. Widgery
believes it is this aspect of col-
laboration that gives artists
their work edge.
"When you first come to an
idea, it still has the possibility of
evolving into something better,"
Widgery said. "I don't even know

myself how the creative process
works, except that I am very
open; I keep the blinders off."
Too much input could lead to
difficulties for the finished prod-
uct, as taggers and graffiti artists'
input could come in the form of
an art installation of their own
covering the "Arbor Winds." But
Widgery is not afraid of this out-
come - she believes that her art
will coincide with what graffiti
artists are attempting to do.
"The community has to
embrace the work, and by involv-
ing the public in every step of the
progress, there's a sense of own-
ership. Art should be considered
like everything else: It needs care
and some maintenance," Widg-
ery said. "(Graffiti artists) respect
fellow artists' work."
Despite having visited Ann
Arbor only twice, Widgery seems
to have a grasp of the city's feel.
Though local artists were also
considered for the project, ulti-
mately Widgery believes that
her outside perspective can add
something.
"I try to come to a place with
no preconceptions. I don't come
with any visual ideas in mind,"
Widgery said. "I've been back
now twice (to Ann Arbor), two
different visits. There's a lot
of physical beauty because of
the trees and the nature every-
where, and I think that it has
a youthful energy that people
respond to. My use of the imag-
ery of wind in relation to the
energy of trees has the embodi-
ment of that intangible, but pres-
ent, energy in the town."

PUBLIC ART
From Page 1B
While it was the AAPAC that
partnered with the DIA to make
this all happen - deciding where
to put each piece and working with
business owners during installation
- it was not, in fact, the AAPAC that
funded the project. A Miami-based
organization dedicated to weaving
"the arts into the fabric of commu-
nities," called the JohnS. and James
L. Knight Foundation, was respon-
sible for funding one of the first
pieces of public art in Ann Arbor,
since the suspension of the Percent
for Art program by the Ann Arbor
City Council and the public art mill-
age's failure to pass in the Novem-
ber election. Both events - as well
as the InsideOut program, which
Ann Arbor residents may have
unknowingly deemed a tax-funded
endeavor - raised questions about
public art in Ann Arbor and how it
wasgoingtotake forminthe future.
The deathofpercent for art
In 2007, the Ann Arbor City
Council implemented the Percent
for Art program, which required
all Capital Improvement Projects
funded by Ann Arbor to set aside
one percent of their project con-
struction funds for public art. Per-
cent for Art also stipulated that,
though the art did not need to be
located on the site itself, it should
relate in some way to the capital
improvement funding source.
Originally, the AAPAC started as
the non-profit Art in Public Places,
an organization with the goal to
raise money for public art in Ann
Arbor.
"Some of the projects that were
started on that dollar were the
Fourth and Washington parking
structure ... and they also helped
manage some of the smaller proj-
ects that led up to the (creation of
the) public arts commission," said
Bob Miller, chair of the AAPAC.
But later, when the commission
needed a more systematic way of
funding public art, it turned to the
Percent for Art system.
To those unfamiliar with the
Percent for Art program or how
public art gets from the sketchbook
to your local park, here's a brief run-
through: The AAPAC has a public
art ordinance that allows it to over-
see public-art projects for the city
of Ann Arbor, and it is responsible
for the approval of all art projects
as well as selecting locations and
artists for those projects. Recom-
mendations for future pieces come
from the commission, though they
have also surfaced from city coun-
cil, city staffor resident suggestions.
When the commission approves a
project, it forms a task force made
up of the arts community, the rel-
evant neighborhood community
and city administration, consisting
of AAPAC members, among oth-
ers. The task force sends out a gen-
eral call to artists, and then reviews
their past work and proposed goals
for the project. Eventually, they

narrow the applicant pool down to
one. Once City Council approves the
contract, the artist can begin fabri-
cation, construction and eventually
implementationofthe piece.
The public-art millage proposed
in the November 2012 elections
would have created a three-yeartax
to go along with this program and
could have generated an estimated
$459,273 in public-art funding not
just for physical installations, but
for the performing arts as well. But
the millage lost- 56 percent against
- leading city council to suspend
the Percent for Art program until
spring 2013. At the time, the sus-
pension wasn't supposed to affect
public art funding in any immediate
way, as CIPs are usually scarce dur-
ing the winter. Yet, to date, the pro-
gram still hasn'treturned.
"There is no more Percent for
Art," Miller said. "The program is
suspended, and I don't think that it
will be resurrected any time soon."
The new program, which has
not yet been tested or implement-
ed, is supposed to extend the pro-
cess from two years to as many as
six, which has its benefits and dis-
advantages.
"The new funding mecha-
nism bakes in projects," Miller
explained. "As in, it incorporates
(public art) projects into the other
potential (Capital Improvement)
projects."
The city will assess potential
locations for public art on a more
case-by-case basis by evaluating
what future CIPs will benefit from
them.
"We will be getting that list in a
few months, and we will look at the
Capital Improvement Projects the
cityis lookingtoundertake," Miller
said, "and we will identify the proj-
ects that we think can or will ben-
efit from enhancement, and those
enhancements mean public art."
This buy-in time gives the
AAPAC an opportunity to raise
community awareness about
upcoming projects.
"The most important thing is to
allow the public to understand the
process of how artwork is brought
to the city."
On the other hand, "baking in"
projects also removes any guaran-
tee that there will be public art at
all.
"The downside for the new pro-
cess is that it is totally at the mercy
of the city administration and the
City Council to decide if art will
be placed anywhere," said Miller.
"And there are no funds allocated
to arts at all until they decide there
are."
Though much is in the transi-
tion phase, the AAPAC's attempt to
involve the community in the pub-
lic art process is one aspect of the
new program that is already bud-
ding. The Argo Cascades, one of
three projectsitesthatwasongoing
when the Percent for Art suspen-
sion was announced, has been the
commission's stepping stone for
these types of improvements.
"They're doing a lot of public
outreach," Miller said of the Argo
Cascades task force. "They've had

in the Museum of Fine Arts in Bos-
ton.
Harries and Rosen-Queralt have
actually gone head to head before,
which is bound to happen to art-
ists who work within the same
medium, and who explore similar
themes in their art.
"Yeah, it's competitive," Harries
said of contending with Rosen-
Queralt. "I think in this case, Jann
is a great artist and I think we're
good artists, so you've got two great
artists who are going to think up
something great for the cascades."
Before starting work on their
proposals, Rosen-Queralt, Harries
and Heder were invited to visit
Ann Arbor and the Argo Cascades
to get a feel for the area.
"We did a little walking tour
of the downtown and the college

campus, and a little bit of the his-
tory and a review about our public
art," Kotarski said.
The artists also took kayaks
down the cascades before meeting
with residents for a meet and greet.
"(Residents) could give their
input about what they think should
go into the artwork and ask ques-
tions about their artwork or just
about the artist," Kotarski said.
Both artists were given a $3,000
stipend for their proposals and will
return in October to present their
designs to the public.
Harries wouldn't disclose any
specifics abouther plans for the site
or even the approach she was tak-
ing to the project, only comment-
ing, "I want to bring something
brave and specific that can happen
nowhere else."

walk-throughs. They've brought
the project to the attention of dif-
ferent committees within the city.
They've also brought people out.
to the site and they've had online
surveys. They're trying to gather as
much public input into that project
as they can before they make any
final decisions. Ithinkthatis avery
good way to move forward with
how we do projects: That's a good
model."
City Council member Chuck
Warpehoski (D-Ward 5), who in
the past has expressed a desire to
give Ann Arbor residents a louder
voice in the creation of public art,
likes the direction the AAPAC is
going.
"I saw one of the commissioners
down at the farmer's market with a
clipboard trying to make sure that
everybody knew about (the Argo
Cascades project) and make sure
everyone got a chance to meet the
artists," he said. "The art commis-
sion is trying to involve the com-
munity in making sure we've got
art that best reflects Ann Arbor,
best reflects our community."
Uncharted waters
The Argo Cascades, between
Furstenburg and Gallup Park, is
a popular tubing, kayaking and
paddle boarding spot for Ann
Arbor residents and tourists. In
April 2012, the AAPAC approved
the site for a public art project
with a budget of $150,000. While
the Argo Cascades is one of the
last three sites to receive funding
through the old mechanism, the
task force is trying to take a pro-
gressive approach to the process,
especially in terms of community
outreach. AAPAC Commissioner
John Kotarski recognizes that he's
navigating somewhat uncharted
waters.
"We're kind of rebuilding the
ship that's left port," he said.

Regardless of the funding tran-
sition, public art projects can often
encounter obstacles. One of the art
pieces tomost recently be installed
in Ann Arbor is the untitled water-
based sculpture by German artist
Herbert Dreiseitl on East Huron
Street. The work was proposed
in 2009, but wasn't fully func-
tional until July of 2012 because
of clogged water pumps and other
electrical problems.
But for the Argo Cascades,
things have been moving, more or N E V
less, according to schedule. When
the AAPAC sent out a call to artists
- including 48 local art organiza-
tions and over 48 regional art orga-
nizations - it received more than
50 submissions.
"It was the kind of outreach we
wanted to have happen," Kotarski
said. "And we took extra care to try
and attract local artists."
Since then, the artist count
has been reduced to two - Jann
Rosen-Queralt and a design team
consisting of Mags Harries and
Lajos Heder.
"We have two very quality art-
ists that are both nationally recog-
nized," Kotarski said. "They work
with natural materials and work
with sustainable water issues....
We look forward to seeing what
they come up with."
Rosen-Queralt has been active
in the art world since 1990. She
teaches at the Maryland Institute
College of Art and has won numer-
ous awards in and around Mary-
land.In 2011, she was the lead artist
for a large art installation at the
Brightwater Wastewater Treat-
ment Facility in Seattle.
Harries and Heder have com-
pleted more than 25 public-art
installations together, though
they're both accomplished indi-
vidual artists as well. Heder won
international prizes with his
design for Expo '96 in Budapest.
Harriess work has been exhibited
