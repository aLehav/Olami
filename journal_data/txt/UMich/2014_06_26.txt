Robinson could follow in dad's footsteps

Weekly Summer Edition MichiganDailycom
ONE-HUNDRED-TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The last time Glenn Robinson
III was in New York, he took center
,,.stage. The former Michigan for-
ward scored17points against Stan-
ford and helped the Wolverines ice
the win down the stretch in the
Brooklyn Hoops Holiday Invita-
tional at the Barclays Center in late
December.
Thursday night, he'll be the
talk of the Barclays Center for the
NBA Draft at some point in the
night, but that point in time is still
unknown.
Though some experts said he
could have been a first-round pick
yin last year's draft, Robinson elect-
ed to return for his sophomore
season. Inconsistency plagued him
throughout the year, and he wasn't
the leading force of Michigan's
offense many expected he would
be. Still, despite some struggles,

Robinson still has head-turning
ability that a lot of NBA general
managers would love.
WHAT WE KNOW: Robinson
was the Wolverines' most gifted
athlete but was never able to show-
case his full potential in Michigan
coach John Beilein's offense. Dur-
ing his freshman year, Robinson
was forced to play the '4' due to the
team's lack of size. He took on the
role, averaging 11 points per game
in his first year and helping the
Wolverines reach the Final Four.
Robinson skipped out on the
draft last year in part because he
thoughtifhe returnedhe could play
his natural '3' position. But with
sophomore forward Mitch McGary
injured, Robinson was relegated to
his less-preferred '4' spot for most
of the year. Robinson admitted he
became more comfortable at that
spot as the year went on, and his
numbers proved it. He averaged
more than 13 points per game and

shot 48.8 percent from the field
during his sophomore campaign.
Had he entered the draft fol-
lowing his freshman year, he likely
would have been guaranteed to
go in the first round. But since
sticking around for a second year
at Michigan, his draft stock has
slipped. ESPN NBA Insider Chad
Ford predicted Robinson going
15th in a preseason mock draft.
Ford has Robinson going 31st in his
latest predictions.
Robinson has had workouts with
the Los Angeles Clippers, Mem-
phis Grizzlies, Toronto Raptors,
Utah Jazz, San Antonio Spurs and
Chicago Bulls over the last month.
WHAT'S POSSIBLE: Expect
Robinson to go late in the first
round or be one of the first picks in
the second round.
We can expect that the team
that will draft him has plans to use
him at the '3' and let him showcase
all his skills. However, one of Rob-

inson's strengths is the fact thathis
6-foot-6, 220-pound frame gives
him the flexibility to fill in down
low. This means a team may take
him and not have him play solely at
the '3' position.
His inconsistent play and com-
fort taking a backseat to Nik Staus-
kas this past season may concern
some NBA front offices, but his raw
athleticism has many scouts drool-
ing over his potential at the next
level.
POTENTIAL LANDING
SPOTS: While Robinson won't
hear his name called first, like his
father, Glenn Robinson, Jr., did in
the 1994 draft, he still might end
up in the same city where his dad
started his career - Milwaukee.
Los Angeles Clippers: The Clip-
pers have the 28th pick and could
pick Robinson up iftheyhave plans
of seeing him and Chris Paul pair
up on the floor. Robinson could
have an immediate impact in Los
Angeles - their current starting
small forward is 34-year-old Matt
Barnes who averaged less than 10
points duringthe regular season.
San Antonio Spurs: There's no
doubt that Robinson would love to
start his career with the defending
champions. Spurs small forward
Kawhi Leonard said he is confi-
dent that he'll agree to a contract
extension with the Spurs, but if he
doesn't, he'd be a restricted free
agent after next season. Regardless

of Leonard staying, San Antonio
coach Gregg Popovich could find
a way to work Robinson into the
lineup as he's proven to do with all
sorts of players during his coaching
career; and Robinson would work
well with a group of guys charac-
terized by their selfless, team-first
attitude. The Spurs have the 30th
pick in the first round.
Milwaukee Bucks: The Bucks
are in desperate need of help after
finishing with the league's worst
record last season at 15-67. Rob-
inson has ties with the team who
drafted his dad and where the elder
Robinson played for eight seasons.
Milwaukee's opening-game starter
at small forward, Caron Butler, was
bought out and later signed by the
Oklahoma City Thunder in Feb-
ruary, so Robinson could imme-
diately come in and play a major
role. The Bucks have the 2nd, 31st
and 36th pick but would likely need
to grab Robinson with the 31st to
make sure he's still available.
PREDICTION: Robinson fol-
lows in his father's footsteps and
gets drafted by the Bucks with the
31st overall pick. Robinson would
work great with Popovich in San
Antonio, but assuming Leonard
gets locked up, the Spurs don't need
another small forward. Of all the
teams eyeing Robinson, Milwaukee
is in need of the most immediate
impact, and Robinson offers them
instant bang for their buck.

ADMINISTRATION
University
faces lack
of housing
for fall term
Some returning
students asked to
give up spaces in
residence halls
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Editor in Chief
About 300 students return-
ing to campus this fall could
be asked to give up their resi-
dence hall room assignments
in exchange for an off-campus
option organized through the
University's housing office.
Housing officials announced
the voluntary program Monday
as an effort to accommodate a
larger than anticipated incom-
ing freshman class. A University
press release stated there could
be several hundred more new
students on campus for Fall 2Q14
than the original estimate of
6,000.
Ted Spencer, associate vice
provost and executive director
of the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions, wrote in an e-mail
statement Tuesday that it was
too early to definitively say what
caused the increases.
In the release, University
Housing Director Linda New-
man stated the University feels
it is important freshmen are
allowed the opportunity to live
on campus in order to ease the
transition to college.
"We hope our returning resi-
dence hall students will appre-
ciate this unique opportunity
to use their Housing contract
to live in a nearby apartment,"
Newman stated.

Regents fund two new degree programs

Students and faculty
pushed for offerings
in robotics and
entrepreneurship
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily News Editor
Starting next school year, stu-
dents will have the opportunity
to pursue degrees in two nontra-
ditional disciplines at the Uni-
versity - entrepreneurship and
robotics.
At the Board of Regents meet-
ing June 19, the Regents and
administration included funding
for an undergraduate entrepre-
neurship minor and a robotics
masters and doctorate degree in
the fiscal year 2015 budget.
Though the approval of fund-
ing is a recent development,
students and faculty have been
pushing for these new degrees
for a while.
The new entrepreneurship
minor began with a partner-
ship between Central Student
Government and Thomas Zur-
buchen, professor of space sci-
ence and aerospace engineering

in 2013. Zurbuchen and student
leaders gathered input from all
different backgrounds, majors
and student organizations to
understand what students would
like to see from an entrepreneur-
ial degree.
Zurbuchen then brought
together campus administrators
from different schools and pro-
grams to push for the degree.
His goal was to give students of
all different disciplinary back-
grounds the tools they needed to
not only form startups, but also
begin to grow ideas and turn
them into entrepreneurial iden-
tities.
"I think that an entrepre-
neurial minor like this basically
equips the student with the tool-
set for taking an idea and doing
it, but also enables a stage on
which you actually do it," Zurbu-
chen said. "In other words, not
just about the tools but to actual-
ly going forward and grow these
ideas and learn how it feels to
actually make an idea happen."
The entrepreneurial minor
will be located in LSA and is
expected to open in January
2015. The program will have two
core classes, which have already
been opened for the fall semes-

ter.
The first is called Entrepre-
neurial Creativity and is run out
of the Psychology department to
give students a feel for how to
think in an entrepreneurial way.
The second is called Entrepre-
neurial Business Basics, an over-
view on capital, management
and marketing basics needed to
form a startup.
Former CSG president Michael
Proppe, who was involved in the
creation of the minor, echoed a
similar sentiment to Zurbuchen.
"What entrepreneurship can
do is more of just starting a busi-
ness, it's able to empower people
to take their ideas and to put
them into practice," he said. "It's
really exciting to see that stu-
dents are going out on their own
and doing things and solving
problems."
The second two new degrees
are a masters and doctorate in
robotics, which have already
accepted a handful of students
for the fall.
These degrees are headed by
Dawn Tilbury, associate dean
for research and graduate educa-
tion, one of the advocates on an
associate steering committee for
robotics along with members of

many other engineering profes-
sors in different concentrations.
Tilbury, along with other
faculty members, said she felt
a robotics degree would enable
students to study robotics across
many different engineering
fields, instead of having to focus
on one aspect of robotic engi-
neering.
The degree program has two
new core classes: Mathematics
for Robotics, a graduate level
math course to introduce stu-
dents to the basic math needed
for the study of robotics; and
Introduction to Robotic Systems,
a hands-on class to expose stu-
dents to different robotic system
and sensory manipulation.
Tilbury said the new robotic
degree programs would appeal to
students who are interested in a
broader study of robotics instead
of solely focusing on a particular
robotic engineering field.
"I think that the students who
take the Ph.D program in robot-
ics will have a much broader
vision about robotics, instead of
deeper vision in their disciplines,
say mechanical engineering or
aerospace engineering," Tilbury
said. "The focus is on robotics
instead of one of the disciplines."

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Editor
You know the story by now.
Michigan wasn't supposed to have
as much success as it had last sea-
son without sophomore forward
Mitch McGary. It wasn't supposed
to win the Big Ten regular-season
title, it wasn't supposed to make
the Elite Eight and it wasn't sup-
posed to have an even more pro-
ductive offensive team than its
2012-13 national runner-up squad.
What seemed possible, though,
was McGary returning for his
junior year and raising his draft
stock that seemed to fall last sea-
son. But then McGary failed a drug
test in March and would have faced
a year-long NCAA suspension if he
returned. So, he ultimately decided
to enter the 2014 NBA Draft weeks
after sophomores Glenn Robinson
III and Nik Stauskas declared.
With everything that unfolded,
McGary can't be faulted for leaving
Michigan early. But you can specu-
late as to whether his short college
career - 47 games, 12 starts - and
his talent and athleticism will
translate to a lengthy NBA career,
or even a first-round selection.
WHAT WE KNOW: McGary
may not have played in as many
games as he would have liked to in
his Michigan career, but he made

McGary a potential late first-rounder

his minutes count.
After starting just two games
in the regular season his fresh-
man year, McGary exploded on the
national scene in the 2013 NCAA
Tournament, averaging a double-
double with 14.3 points and 10.8
rebounds. His play earned him
a spot on the All-South Regional
team and All-Tournament team.
But then the back injury side-
lined him for Michigan's first two
regular-season games before he
came back for the Wolverines' next
eight. Those eight games were all
McGary would play for Michigan
before undergoing season-ending
surgery.
Now, the bulk of McGary's draft
stock is built on his athleticism,
strength and potential. Clearly,
McGary has the resume of a player
who could be a lottery selection.
But his lingering back problems
might scare away teams from tak-
ing a chance on a player who could
either playlike he did last March or
sit on a bench for a long stretch like
he did this past season.
WHAT'S POSSIBLE: In recent
days, a lot of news has circulated
around McGary. From older mock
drafts, McGary was projected to
the Miami Heat at No. 26, the Los
Angeles Clippers at No. 28 or the
San Antonio Spurs at No. 30.
Meanwhile, the big man has only

participated in one known workout
- last Friday with the Milwaukee
Bucks, who hold the first pick of the
second round.
Some media members have
speculated that the reasoning
behind McGary not participat-
ing in workouts could be health-
related, as evidenced by his refusal
to take a pre-draft physical to run
tests on his lower back. Others see
the move to indicate McGary has a
guarantee from a late first-round
team totake him.
The most recent rumor from
ESPN NBA Insider Chad Ford
predicts that McGary will land at
No. 24 to the Charlotte Hornets.
Sporting News NBA writer Sean
Deveney reported Wednesday that
according to a source, McGary "has
been all but assured" that he will be
picked in the first round.
POTENTIAL LANDING
SPOTS: The most likely landing
spots for McGary are the Hornets,
Heat, Clippers, Spurs and Bucks.
Additionally, the Phoenix Suns
have been mentioned as a potential
destination because of their three
first-round picks, including two
late ones, No.18 and No. 27.
Miami Heat: With LeBron
James opting out of his deal and
Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh pos-
sibly following suit, the Heat could
have a very bare roster heading

into the offseason. With upwards
of $50 million in cap space avail-
able and plenty of roster spots open
on a veteran-heavy team, the draft
represents a market for the Heat to
improve in a number of areas.
One place the Heat could look
is the backcourt. With inconsis-
tent play from Mario Chalmers,
who will be a free agent this sum-
mer, and Norris Cole, Miami could
go for a proven college player like
Connecticut's Shabazz Napier.
At the same time, the Heat's
frontcourt is thin. Miami has Udo-
nis Haslem, but he's not getting
any younger, nor are his minutes
increasing.
With speculation of Bosh, Wade
and James returning to Miami,
McGary could fill the rebounding
void of the Heat. He wouldn't have
to start, but McGary would supply
much-needed youth and energy off
the bench.
San Antonio Spurs: Well, they're
the defending NBA champions,
Tim Duncan just announced he'll
be returning for his 19th season
and coach Gregg Popovich will be
back as well.
For a team that plays in a system
that focuses on patience, selfless-
ness and passing the ball to find the
bestshot, McGarywould fitrightin.
Unlike a place like Los Angeles
or Miami, McGary could grow into

his role, learning from one of the
best in Duncan. Given the Spurs'
depth, McGary would be able to
learn the system at a slower pace,
while still getting some minutes
in blowouts or when Popovich
decides to resthis starters.
Charlotte Hornets: The Hor-
nets' interest in Stauskas has been
known for a while. But their inter-
est in McGary has only recently
been reported.
The main reason behind the
Hornets' interest is their lack of
height. Despite being their start-
ing center, Al Jefferson stands
just 6-foot-10, a bit undersized
for a center. Though they hope to
resign forward Josh McRoberts to
help Jefferson in the paint, it's stilley
unclear what to expect from Char-
lotte's 2013 first-round pick, Cody
Zeller.
PREDICTION: As tantalizing
as it is to have Stauskas and McGary
stay together in Charlotte, I don't
see it happening. The Hornets can
afford to wait to draft another big
man until the second round and
draft the best available player with
their second first-round selection.
That's why I see the next inter-
ested team, the Heat, taking
McGary. In that way, McGary will
stillbe reunited with aformer Wol-
verine - in the form of Heat assis-
tant coach Juwan Howard instead.

issues by adopting climate change
action plans.
She cited several local impacts
of global rises in temperature in
her speech, including a rise in nat-
ural disasters that could put basic
city infrastructure at risk, emer-
gency services that could become
strained due to larger, more fre-
quent storms and the general
inconvenience of excessive rain.
Similar potential impacts were
also raised in the GLISA report.
"Adaptation is about buildings,
cities, families, employees, etc. It
is incredibly local," Coffee said,
"Local government is an early
actor, and adaptation often comes
from political motivations."
Coffee also discussed nonprof-

its briefly, and added that they
shouldn't be the only sector con-
sidered when it comes to solving
climate change issues.
Missy Stults, a University
research assistant who helped
with the event, said the over-
all goal of the conference was to
understand what lies ahead for
the Great Lakes, especially in
terms of climate change, and what
that means for homes, businesses,
and communities.
"It's about what businesses do
and why, and us making the busi-
ness case for why taking action
matters," she said. "It's about
what local governments can do,
and it's also about what you and
I can do in our lives to make sure
that we are prepared and reduc-
ing our footprint. It's all scales, all
sectors, and it's going to take all of
us to do this."

Larkin awaits draft fate

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
Dylan Larkin is set to make the
Big Ten hockey record books before
he even skates in a maize sweater.
. Friday, the incoming freshman
forward and former U.S. Nation-
al Team Development Program
standout should be drafted in
the first round of the NHL Draft,
making him the first player in the
Big Ten's two-year existence to be
selected in the first round.
Though SB Nation's Bob McK-
enzie lists him as the No. 12 pick,
most mock drafts project Larkin,
the centerpiece to the Michigan
hockey team's 2014-15 freshman
class, going between 15th and 17th.
Still, Larkin's draft stock has
improved since mid-season rank-
ings thanks to a two-goal, two-
assist performance at the IIHF

Men's Under-18 World Champion-
ships, in which the United States
took gold.
Larkin will be the only Wolver-
ine present at the Wells Fargo Cen-
ter in Philadelphia this weekend
and will likely be the onlyincoming
freshman drafted. Assistant coach
Brian Wiseman will also attend the
draft.
Michigan had five players,
including four incoming fresh-
men - defenseman Nolan De Jong
(Minnesota Wild), defenseman
Michael Downing (Florida Pan-
thers), forward Tyler Motte (Chi-
cago Blackhawks) and forward JT
Compher - drafted in 2013. Cap-
tain and junior forward Andrew
Copp was also selected bythe Win-
nipeg Jets in the fourth round.
A late commit to the program,
goaltenderZachNagelvoorthasput
himself in a position to be drafted.

In place of injured sophomore net-
minder Steve Racine, ' Nagelvoort
became one of the best goaltendern'a
in the NCAA and finished the sea-
son allowing just 2.20 goals per
game, good for 15th among Divi-
sion I goalies. Nagelvoort's .929
save percentage placed him second
only to Shawn Hunwick on the pro-
gram's single-season record list.
A single-game school-record
63 saves in a double-overtime loss
to Penn State in the Big Ten Tour-
nament perhaps solidified Nagel-
voort's potential draft stock. He
is currently ranked No. 21 among
North American goalies.

Stauskas eyes lottery selection

Detroit Beat: Fitting into the city as a 'U' student

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Editor
A lot has changed for former
Michigan guard Nik Stauskas
over the past year. He became a lot
stronger thanks to the strength and
conditioning program at Michigan,
and he became more explosive on
the basketball court as he added
penetration and shot creation to
his already strong 3-point shooting
arsenal.
And at some point in the near
future, more change will come into
Stauskas' life as he walks across
the Barclays Center stage, wearing
ahat to represent his new team and
job. He may soon be a millionaire
as well.
With the NBA Draft coming up
Thursday, the Daily broke down
Stauskas' stock in the loaded 2014
talent pool and evaluated potential
destinations for the Mississauga,
Ontario native.
WHAT WE KNOW: Stauskas
won the 2014 Big Ten Player of the
Year award and was named to the
All-American second team and Big
Ten All-Tournament team.
Beyond that, Michigan fans
will remember Stauskas for his six
3-pointers in the team's 2013 Elite
Eight game against Florida, which
powered the Wolverines to their
first Final Four since 1993.
Since announcing his decision to
leave Michigan after his sophomore
season, Stauskas has made visits
or worked out for the Sacramento
Kings, Denver Nuggets, Minnesota
Timberwolves, Golden State
Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers,
'Charlotte Hornets and Boston
Celtics.

Seen as the best shooter in
this year's draft class, at 6-foot-6,
Stauskas will have the chance to
play guard and potentially small
forward depending on the team
he goes to. Stauskas has drawn
comparisons to current Los
Angeles Clippers guard J.J. Redick,
the all-time leadingscorer at Duke.
WHAT'S POSSIBLE: After
accepting an invitation from the
NBA to sit in the green room on
draft day, it's easy to see Stauskas
as a late lottery pick, going
somewhere between ninth and
14th.
While Stauskas improved his
game to a new level this past year at
Michigan, teams interested in him,
while impressed by his athleticism
and length, see him as a role player
who would be able to spread the
floor and potentially provide a
3-pointspark off the bench.
Regardless of questions
regarding his athleticism, Stauskas
could thrive if put in the right
situation, despite the argument
that he is not just a shooter.
Toprepare forthe draft,Stauskas
has been working out in Chicago
along with former Creighton
forward Doug McDermott and
former Michigan State forward
Adreian Payne, among others.
McDermott, standing at 6-foot-8,
shares the ability to make buckets,
hence his nickname "Dougie
McBuckets." While the two have
become friends from training
together, it'll be interesting to see
which of the two comes off the
board first.
POTENTIAL LANDING
SPOTS: Of the seven teams that
have worked out Stauskas, the

Hornets and Timberwolves -
ninth and 13th picks, respectively
- have most often been projected
to select Stauskas. Additionally,
the Philadelphia 76ers and
Phoenix Suns have been tied to the
sharpshooter.
Phoenix Suns: After just missing
out on the final playoff spot in
the Western Conference last
season, the Suns return a young
core of guards Goran Dragic and
Eric Bledsoe, though Bledsoe is
technically a restricted free agent.
With the backcourt most likely
secured for years to come, a fast-
paced, athletic team like the Suns
could look to add a taller stretch-
two like Stauskas to open up the
floor.
After averaging the seventh-
most points and sixth-most
3-pointers per game last season,
the Suns have the ability to improve
a strength of the team.
With Miles Plumlee, twins
Marcus and Markieff Morris and
2013 first round pick Alex Len
returning in the frontcourt, the
Suns can afford to take chances
this year. They also hold two other
first-round picks, so if they do
become locked in on a particular
player, a trade is possible.
Though the Suns two most
accurate 3-point shooters are
Dragic and Gerald Green, the Suns
could lose forward Channing Frye
in free agency, opening the door for
a new player to complete the trio of
sharpshooters. Enter Stauskas.
Philadelphia 76ers: Holding the
third and 10th selections in the
draft, the 76ers have a bevy of

Growing up in suburban Detroit,
LSA sophomore Michael Olson was
unfamiliar with Detroit and rarely
went to the city outside of sporting
events and concerts.
But this summer, he began going
to downtown Detroit five days a
week as one of more than 1,000
interns at Quicken Loans, which
employs 8,000 people in downtown
Detroit.
LSA senior Jessica Lakind and
Public Policy junior Blair Sucher,
who both did summer internships
in Detroit through the Semester in
Detroit Program, have similar sto-
ries. Both didn't really engage with
the city until they got to college.
For many University students,
Detroit evokes visions of a city past
its peak. Detroit filed for bankrupt-
cy in 2013. Its finances are under
the control of emergency financial
manager Kevyn Orr until Septem-
ber. Between 2000 and 2010, rough-
ly a quarter of Detroit's population
left the city.
However, despite all that, some
University students, such as Olson,
Lakind, and Sucher have chosen
look beyond that vision and spend
their summer working and living in
Ann Arbor's neighbor to the east.
Geni Harclerode, assistant direc-
tor of experiential learning and
employer development at the Uni-
versity's Career Center, works with
experiential learning programs,
which she defines as internships,
events at workplaces, career fairs
and networking events. She said she
has seen more and more students
seeking out opportunities in Detroit
in recentyears, and more employers
in the city looking for young people.
"A lot of students are really excit-

ed by what is possible in that land-
scape," she said. "It is a really great
place and we've seen a lot of interest
in people being a part of that."
Part of Harclerode's job is orga-
nizing half-day immersions at
businesses, many of which are in
Detroit. Olson decided to apply at
Quicken Loans after he participat-
ed in one of these immersion pro-
grams.
QuickenLoansmovedtheirhead-
quarters from the suburbs of the
city to downtown in August 2010,
bringing more than 8,000 employ-
ees downtown. Five
years ago, the com-
pany had only 35
summer interns, but "It's
since moving it has
expanded to over start
1,000 in the summer
and 150 to 200 in the of t
fall and winter.
"I've been amazed abou
by the number of
interns applying b
and interviewing
who tell us _they've
heard what we're
doing in Detroit and
they want to come be a part of the
city's revitalization," Vice President
of Recruiting Michelle Salvatore
wrote in an e-mail. "To really get a
feel for everything that's going on
in Detroit you have to be downtown
and actually experience it."
In a reflection of that empha-
sis, Quicken's internship program
includes events throughout the
summer in Detroit along with work.
Olson said during his time in the
city, he had the opportunity to go
on bus tours throughout Detroit,
attend Tigers games, tour the
DetroitInstitute of the Arts and vol-
unteer throughout the city.
"Being down here every daygives

you alot more respect for the city,"
he said. "The media gives Detroit
such a bed rep and it's frustrating.
I definitely didn't think the city was
as nice as it was going to be. Coming
downhere andseeing allofthe busi-
nesses doing so well has given me a
positive respect for it."
Detroit's resurgence, especially
when it comes to business success
in places like Corktown, has gained
both regional and national atten-
tion. Much of Detroit's resurgence
can also be found in Midtown,
which boasts five museums, the

Detroit Medical Center, more than
40 restaurants, a Whole Foods that
opened in 2013, and Wayne State
University. Housing occupancy
there is at more than 95 percent and
the area has experienced more than
$1.8 billion in development since
2000.
A short walk or drive down
Woodward Avenue, downtown has
also seen recent growth and devel-
opment. Quicken Loans CEO Dan
Gilbert has purchased upwards of
30 buildings with plans for more
development, many businesses are
moving downtown and the river-
front was recently refurbished.
As Detroit has changed, the Uni-

versity's connection to it has as well.
The Semester in Detroit program,
through which students spend
winter or spring semester living,
interning and taking related classes
in Detroit, is in its fifth year. The
Detroit Connector, providing free
weekend bus service to and from
Detroit and Ann Arbor, began run-
ning in fall 2013.
Student organizations like
the Detroit Partnership are also
involved in Detroit, running weekly
volunteer programs in the city and
bringing hundreds to sites around
Detroit every winter
on Detroit Partner-
ship Day. Semester in
ay to Detroit, which both
Sucher and Lakind
ances are participating in
this summer, was
rear initially begun by
students inFall 2006,
Lr the with the first group
of students going to
," Detroit in Winter
2009. Beyond work-
ing in the city- each
student interns with
a nonprofit- the pro-
gram places a similar emphasis on
immersion.
Students are housed at Wayne
State University apartments
in Midtown and the program
includes classes in Detroit history,
a seminar examining the intern-
ships and an optional creative
writing class. During the winter
semester, students can opt to take
classes through Wayne State Uni-
versity. Students initially began the
program in Fall 2006 and the first
group of students went to the city
in Winter 2009.
However, as students have got-
ten more involved in the city, ques-
tions of how to navigate through the

impacts of burgeoning expansion,
and its effects on the city, have also
sprung up.
Sucher, who is a part of Semester
in Detroit this year, is from Farm-
ington Hills, about 25 minutes
from Detroit by car. Growing up,
her exposure to Detroit was limited
to Eastern Market, sporting events,
a few restaurants downtown and a
family business located on the east
side. Her parents' families were a
part of the white flight in the 1960s
and didn't often go to Detroit.
In college, however, Sucher got
involved in the Detroit Partnership
and became more interested in the
city.
As a policy intern with Com-
munity Development Advocates of
Detroit, Sucher worked with the
organization's public policy advo-
cacy project to educate the public
about city council and other matters
throughout the city.
"It's been a really great way to
start to understand the nuances of
the problems that we hear about
on the news and hear the backstory
behind them," she said. "There's a
lot more going on than what you see
on the news and that's been some-
thing that I've always wanted to
understand."
However, though Sucher praised
the communities in Detroit, she
said she was unsure if she could see
herself living there one day and felt
conflicted about the rapid develop-
ment occurring near her internship
and apartmentin Midtown.

dures are guaranteed on-campus
housing, according to the housing
website.
The program would give return-
ing students who are currently
signed up for University Housing
the option to transfer their Uni-
versity agreement to one of the off-
campus options, thus opening up
space for incoming freshmen. The
University would cover any dif-
ference in rent above the standard
residence hall costs.

Students electing the off-cam-
pus option would also receive some
of the same services provided to
students in the residence halls,
such as included utilities and meal
plans for campus dining halls.
So far, three local apartment
complexes - The Courtyards, The
Varsity and University Towers
- have signed agreements with
the University to accommodate
the overflow. University Housing
Spokesman Peter Logan said the
University is currently negotiating
with at least one other apartment
complex in the area.
The University has acquired a
number of leases for these apart-

ments already, and will continue
to do so depending, in part, on the
amount of interest they see among
returning students.
Logan said housing officials
received about 100 emails express-
ing interest in the program from
returning students in the first few
hours after it was announced.
Similarly to Newman, Logan
said the University values the
experience incoming students
receive through residence halls
and programs. Currently, about 97
to 98 percent of incoming fresh-
men live in residence halls their
first year on campus.
"We know from our own experi-

ences and from studies in this field
in higher education that it's the
new student that benefits the most
from the on-campus living experi-
ence," Logan said. "Knowing that
particularly the first year experi-
ence on campus is important for
helping students make that transi-
tion and helping them be success-
ful in their academic pursuits, as
well as socially, we give incoming
students - the new students -
the priority, then as we can, with
available space, we make (rooms)
available to returning students
who want to continue to live with
us."
In total, the University resi-

dence hall capacity for Fall 2014
is projected at 8,420, an increase
from 8,360 in Fall 2013. While the
opening of South Quad Residence
Hall will add 1,170 extra beds, that
increase will be offset through the
closing of 1,110 beds in West Quad
Residence Hall and Cambridge
House due to construction.
Since Fall 2011, when total
occupancy was 9,600, ongoing
construction projects have taken
about 1,200 rooms each year out of
usage. The pattern of opening and
closing dorms has kept the over-
all number fairly consistent since
then, though considerably below
maximum operating capacity.

Raising aid limitingelp
The University must further asssit low SES students after increases
Last Saturday, the University's Board of Regents passed the
school's operating budget and a multitude of proposals
including tuition increases, a hike in housing costs, an
initiative to decrease class sizes and an increase in need-based
financial aid allocations. While increasing the amount of faculty
members and keeping tuition hikes under the rate of inflation for
in-state students is commendable, the Regents should provide
more assistance to help students from lower socioeconomic
backgrounds who reside both in and out of the state afford a

Mom, Dad, don't read this.
Two months ago, I embarked on
a journey to delve into the world
of Tinder. A bunch of strange
interactions and 341 matches later, I
have more than a review to share of
Tinder - the app that many of us have
but rarely talk about.
Like almost every college student,
I knew what Tinder was. It was the
"dating" app notoriously known for
hookups. Yet, actually using Tinder
changed my perspective on the app.
To my surprise, it wasn't all about
hooking up. After analyzing my
matches, I realized that only 5 percent
of my matches were people solely
interested in hookups. The majority,
75 percent, were people who either
never responded or didn't have the
conversational capacity to get past a
"hello" or "how are you." If this app
was 75 percent boring, why was I
continually swiping and comforted by
the glow of Tinder flame notifications
at 3 am? How and why was the app
getting millions of daily active users?
Since Tinder is a relatively new app,
there isn't much published research
on it so I had to settle for my personal
hypothesis. We humans are social
creatures and studies have shown
that our interaction with others is
important to "human development
and behavior." Tinder offers a chance
to converse and even physically
interact, unlike Facebook and Twitter,
without the fear of rejection. In other
words, we crave interaction even if it
means sitting through a few awkward
pickup lines.
At the same time, Tinder is
innovative because it reflects our
generation's need for speed. As its
description says, "it's like real life,
but better." How different is the act
of swiping than the usual yet silent
discrimination of people that occurs
at any college function? Knowing that
both parties are mutually attracted,
the key advantage of Tinder, makes

interaction a bit faster and easier.
On the other hand, Tinder still
adheres to cultural and evolutionary
norms. I noticed the parallels between
Tinder and the traditional dating
scene and animal mating scene. In
nature, females tend to be choosier in
selection than their male counterparts
(you can take Bio 171 or Psych 230 to
learn more about this fascinating
phenomenon). Tinder is no different
- my female friends left swipe or
reject many more people than my male
friends do. Similarly, the profiles on
Tinder are reflections of hegemonic
gender archetypes. Men can often be
found showing off their shirtless gym
body or donning a giant fish whereas
women flaunt their feminine curves
in usually some bikini-clad way. I've
come to the conclusion that perhaps
the dating game hasn't changed, but
only the means have.
Now that I've developed a basic
understanding of Tinder, you probably
arewonderinghowmystoryconcludes.
Well thetruth is, itdoesn't. Though I'm
deleting Tinder and the experiment
is over (since I've exhausted the
potential matches in my area), the
experience was much more serious
than expected. As observational as
I tried to make this, I couldn't help
but get caught up in the assortment
of emotions that went along with
using Tinder. As an upcoming single
college sophomore searching for my
place in the world, I knew I needed
to go beyond my horizons, my radius.
I, once an introverted high school
girl, quickly became enveloped in the
thrill of Tinder. I was encompassed in
the conversation, the people and the
stories behind them.
Tinder can be an instrument, albeit
an unfortunately stigmatized one, to
spark relationships and reignite the
flame of curiosity about what makes
us human.

University education.
The Regents prevented a
higher increase for Michigan
residents by once again raising
out-of-state tuition. Students
who reside in Michigan will
face a 1.6 percent tuition
increase, paying $206 more a
year while out-of-state students
will experience a 3.2 percent
tuition increase bringing
the their undergraduate
tuition to $41,578 for the
fall and winter semesters. A
5.8 percent increase in the
state appropriations to the
University helped lessen
the burden of rising tuition
costs and boosted financial
aid amounts though the
appropriations were minute
compared to previous decades.
Given the University's a
public institution supported
by Michigan taxpayers,
Michigan residents should
be given the opportunity to

pay lower tuition than out-
of-state students. However,
non-Michigan students paying
more than three times as
much as Michigan residents
causes problems for lower SES
students residing out of the
state. With out-of-state tuition
costing more than $50,000
a year including housing,
middle and lower class families
struggle to afford tuition. This
expense oftentimes makes
the University only plausible
for out-of-state students from
high SES backgrounds. While
the University has increased
student aid . by $19.5 million
this year, these funds will
predominantly go to resident
students. Increasing aid by 17.2
percent is admirable on the
Board's part, however, more
work should go to help all
studentsoflowersocioeconomic
statuses and diversify the SES

backgrounds at the University.
To further aid students, the
Board of Regents allocated
$6 million in the operating
budget towards a program
aimed at hiring at least 60
new faculty members within
a two years. With more
faculty members, University
students will experience
smaller class sizes which
has been shown to increase
learning among students and
lower the achievement gap
between ethnic and racial
groups. Similarly, students are
able to form more personal
relationships with their
professors and receive more
feedback during the course in
smaller classes. With tuition
increases under the inflation
rate, financial aid increases
and a decrease in classroom
size will benefit thousands of
University students.

hand, is a home run. The minimal-
ist bass-and-piano beat, courtesy of

Sheeran's rapping ability is also
in top form on "The Man." While
nobody's going to mistake him for

dently powers through the stream-

give way to a slinky, understated
chorus. When Sheeran's at his best,
he surprises you with his ability to
impress in more genres than just
folk-pop. The craziest moment on x
comes when "Thinking Out Loud"
starts with normal crooning sing-
er-songwriter vocals until all of a
sudden he goes into full-on "Let's

ous because this red-headed Brit-
ish kid is tryingto be Marvin Gaye,
but then it's just a jolt of excitement
because he's actually succeeding.
Sheeran's record company cer-
tainly put a lot of muscle behind
making x a hit (Pharrell's presence
alone proves that), but it's clear that
Sheeran was also complicit in this
strategy. By all accounts, Sheeran
has worked extremely hard to get
where he is now, and I don't want to
criticize him for his well-deserved
success, but - at least in its weakest
moments - x smacks of a very tal-
ented artist holding back. The most
encouragingthing, however, is that
Sheeran is only 23. With as much
talent and genre-bending flexibility
as he has, right now, going forward
with his music, there are a million
different paths that he could take.
Next album will hopefully feature a
stronger Sheeran boldly venturing
on the most ambitious path.

The housing divide

n 2013, amidst
surrounding the dev

housing in Ann
Arbor, I took
the position
that these new
buildings were

would complain
that complexes
like Landmark, MES
Zaragon and BRENNAN
Varsity were
ruining the
city's character
as a quirky, medium-sized college
town. My defense was simple: the
addition of high-density buildings
would add more housing supply,
therefore lowering the cost for
everyone else. Considering the
current state of student housing,
the addition of new units to lower
costs was a logical idea worth
trying.
We have yet to see a marked
decrease in housing prices across
the board, but that isn't to say it
won't still happen down the road.
Even if it does,
endorsing the
development
of luxury high Housing's
rises has turned impacti
out to be a
terrible position campus' pO
to hold.
Goinginto the
spring semester,
I decided that for summer housing
I was going to find a sublease in
either Landmark or Zaragon, the
two most popular luxury apartment
buildings. Like always, the summer
housing supply far exceeds demand,
allowing rent prices to be a fraction
of what they would normally be.
Through a friend, I found a spot
in a four-bedroom Landmark loft
for $300 a month - half of what I
will be paying for my other, much
less luxurious apartment in the
fall. Like many other students,
without a huge reduction in costs,
I wouldn't be able to afford a place
like Landmark.
Within a day of moving in, I
realized how bad these buildings
are for the campus.
While Ann Arboris very much in
need of more off-campus housing
in nearby areas, not to mention
much less shoddy, dilapidated
living spaces, Landmark, Zaragon

and others are not the solution
to this problem. Instead, they
are contributing to the further
polarization and segregation of
students off campus.
Spend a day in the lobby of
Landmark and watch the people
who come in and out of the
building. It's not a varied group.
Landmark predominantly houses
wealthier students. These students
are already likely to self-segregate,
but then we construct buildings
that densely house people able
to afford $1,000 a month in rent.
While there is expensive housing
everywhere, there are no other
places where such huge numbers of
people that are so similar in social
class live (except, of course, far off
campus in low cost housing, which
presents an opposite but similar
problem).
High-rise, luxury apartments
are not a way to solve Ann Arbor's
student housing dilemma. Yes,
we have plenty of students that
can afford to live in Zaragon and
Landmark, and we should make
available more high-end housing
units for these
students.
However, our

easier 'for our

should instead
be encouraging the construction
of more large, mixed-income
developments. Moreover, the
University and students need to
start taking landlords and housing
companies to task for the crummy,
potentially dangerous houses and
apartments that we are forced to
overpay for.
Housing is not just an issue
of affordability but a major
psychological hurdle impacting
the campus's polarization.
Desegregating housing would not
just encourage students to become
better friends with their peers but
could lessen the effects of ever
increasing polarization based
on race and class. If we can live
together - and, of course, party
together - maybe we can better
understand each other too.
