If department meets
standard, 'U' will
be first accredited,
in Big Ten
By TREVOR CALERO
Daily News Editor
In a press release to be distrib-
uted today, the Department of
Public Safety has announced that
it will undergo a national accredi-
tation assessment from the Com-
mission on Accreditation for Law
Enforcement Agencies.
A team of CALEA assessors
will spend the next few weeks
examining the department's poli-
cies, procedures and operations
to verify that the department has
voluntarily met the commission's
established set of more than 400
professional standards.
tf the assessors conclude that
DPS meets their standards, the.
University will be the first school
in the Big. Ten to receive this
national accreditation.
"Accreditationis ahighlyprized
recognition of law enforcement
professional excellence," DPS
Executive Director Ken Magee
said in the press release.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said the department has
spent the past year reviewing,
revising and, in some cases, cre-
ating policies and procedures
to meet the various standards
required by the commission to
achieve accreditation.

Brown said the assessors will
not only look at the department's
book of policies, but will also go
through files that show proof of
how the department has fulfilled
the requirements.
After the CALEA assessors com-
plete their review, they will bring
their findings to the full commis-
sion, which will then decide wheth-
er or not DPS will be accredited.
"By achieving accreditation, it
will affirm the highly professional
work that the staff has been doing
for several years," Brown said.
"And it will add, for some people,
another degree of credibility to
those efforts."
In addition to verifying that
DPS has met the requirements,
the team of assessors will conduct
interviews with members of the
department and solicit comments
from University staff, faculty, stu-
dents and other members of the
community.
A public information session
is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Feb. 2
in the Kipke Conference Center,
located within the Campus Safety
Services Building on Kipke Drive,
to fulfill the public comment por-
tion of the assessment.
Individuals who are unable
to attend the public session are
encouraged to call (734) 615-8886
on Feb. 2 between 1p.m. and 3 p.m.
According to the press release,
"Telephone comments as well as
appearances at the public infor-
mation session are limited to 10
minutes and must address the
agency's ability to comply with
CALEAs standards."

Walkway would tie
Law Quad to new
additions
By KYLE SWANSON
and JASMINE ZHU
DailyStaffReporters
The University is currently in
the process of asking Ann Arbor
city officials for permission to

close a section of Monroe Street
between South State Street and
Oakland Avenue and transform it
into a pedestrian mall.
The car-free zone would connect
the Law Quad and the future site of
the Law School's 100,000-square-.
foot expansion across the street.
If approved, control of the public
right-of-way - a.status in which
the public has the right to travel
on a space - in the area would be
turned over to the University.

Jim Kosteva, director of com-
munity relations for the Universi-
ty, said the pedestrian mall would
"strengthen the continuity of the
Law Quad."
Thus far, there is no specific
layout or budget plan, but Kosteva
said the money would likely come
from University resources and
fundraising.
Many students and- area resi-
dents are split over the University's
proposal.

First-year law student Carl
Chaker, who lives in Ann Arbor
and commutes to the Law School,
said he thinks that blocking Mon-
roe Street would only be beneficial
to only the select few who live in
the Law Quad and a hindrance to
everyone else.
"Any blockage of streets could
make my commute potentially
harder," Chaker said.
On the other hand, second-year

University children's
hospital also picked
as best in the state
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
DailyStaffReporter
C.S. Mott Children's Hospital
has been ranked by Parents Maga-
zine as one of the best children's
hospitals in the country for 2008.
On the list of the top 30, Mott
ranked 18th and topped the list of
children's hospitals in the state of
Michigan.
The ranking was based on a
250-question survey completed
by more than 100 hospitals. The
survey asked hospitals about
their survival rates, quantity of
complex procedures, research
studies, staff qualifications and
safeguards to prevent medical
errors.
"Ranking18th out of all the chil-
dren's hospitals in the country is
very exciting," said Patricia War-
ner, associate hospital director of
children's and women's services at
the University of Michigan Health
System. "To me, this is a wonder-
ful external recognition of the tre-
mendous work that's done here by
our faculty and staff."
The hospital dropped five spots
from when it ranked 13th in 2006.

Katie Vloet, ssokeswoman for the
University of Michigan Health
System, said most of the hospitals
that were ranked have very close
scores.
"There tends to be some up
and down movement in the rank-
ings from year to year due to
slight changes in methodology,
how many hospitals respond to
the survey and the year-to-year
fluctuations that all hospitals
experience in areas such as the
number of medical procedures
performed, survival rates and
other statistics," Vloet said in an
e-mail interview.
The magazine used a point
system to. evaluate the question-
naires. The Children's Hospital
of Philadelphia earned the most
points and the No. 1 ranking. The
Children's Hospital of Michigan
in Detroit was also on the list at
No. 25.
Mott's high ranking from Par-
ent's Magazine comes on the heels
of several other rankings that
praised the hospital.
In May, U.S. News and World
Report ranked Mott highly in
seven pediatric specialty areas
including cancer, neurology and
digestive disorders. And accord-
ing to Mott's website, the Neona-
tal Intensive Care Unit at Mott
was among the first in the world

CANADIAN UNION TO PROPOSE
BAN ON ISRAELI PROFESSORS
The Canadian Union of Puhlic
Employees will introduce a reso-
lution next month barring Israeli
acadennics from teaching, speaking
or doing research at Ontario uni-
versities unless they first condemn
Israel's recent actions, reported
The Glohe and Mail.
The resolution is a response to
recent Israeli troop advancenment
in Gaza.
The CUPE, the largest lahor
union in Canada, cited hombing
that damaged the Islamic Univer-
sity of Gaza. Israeli spokesper-
suns said the university served as
a development center for Hamas
weapons.
CUPE President Sid Ryan com-
pared the attack to actions of Nazi
Germany. saying the university
was deliherately targeted. Ryan
later apologized for the remark.

STUDENTS WIN TUITION SUIT
After thc California Supreme
Court declined to hear an appeal
hy the University of California in a
lawsuit hrought against it hy eight
students, UC paid ahout $33 nmil-
lion to 35,000 students, the Contra
Costa Times reported.
Eight students filed a class-
action lawsuit in 2003 after the UC
system increased tuition after pre-
viously promising not to raise cer-
tain fees. UC administrators said
they made the hike to compensate
for a state budget shortfall.
A 2006 ruling in the case said
the the decision to raise the fees
was a breach of contract hetween
the university and the students.
An appeals court affirmed the rul-
ing in 2007.
The payouts, ranging from $1
to $12000 per student, averaged
$200 to $3011.

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
Senate Democrats
pass wilderness
protection bill
In a rare session yesterday, the
Senate advanced legislation that
would set aside more than 2 million
acres in nine states as wilderness.
Majority Democrats assembled
more than enough votes to over-
come GOP stalling tactics in an early
showdown for the new Congress.
Republicans complained that
Democrats did not allow amend-
ments on the massive bill, which
calls for the largest expansion of
wilderness protection in 25 years.
But Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid, D-Nev., and other Democrats
said the bill - a holdover from last
year - was carefully written and
included measures sponsored by
both Republicans and Democrats.
By a 66-12 vote, with only 59
needed to limit debate, lawmakers
agreed to clear away procedural
hurdles despite partisan wrangling
that had threatened pledges by
leaders to work cooperatively as the
new Obama administration takes
office. Senate approval is expected
later this week. Supporters hope
the House will follow suit.
KARACHI, Pakistan.
Anti-Israel protest
repelled with tear
gas and batons
Security forcesused tear gas and
batons to repel anti-Israel protest-
ers who tried to attack a U.S. con-
sulate in Pakistan yesterday, as tens
of thousands in Europe, the Middle
East and Asia demonstrated against
Israel's offensive in Gaza.
A protestintheBelgiancapitalthat
drew 30,000 turned violent as well,
with demonstrators overturning cars
and smashing shop windows. And in
Manila, Philippines, policemen used
shields to disperse students protest-
ing outside the U.S. Embassy.
Israel launched its campaign in
Gaza on Dec. 27 to stop rocket fire
from the militant Palestinian group
Hamas. Gaza health officials say
nearly 870 Palestinians have been
killed, roughly half of them civilians.
Thirteen Israelis have also died.
Some 2,000 protesters in the
Pakistani port city of Karachi
burned U.S. flags and chanted
anti-Israel slogans, and several
hundred of them marched on the
U.S. Consulate, senior police offi-
cial Ameer Sheikh said.
PAREPARE, Indonesia.
Storm sinks
Indonesian ferry,
250 feared dead
Rocky seas hindered rescuers
today as they searched for nearly
250 people missing and feared dead
after a ferry capsized off Indone-
sia's Sulawesi island.
About 250 passengers and 17
crew were believed to have been
aboard the 700-ton Teratai Prima
when it sank Sunday morning as
it traveled from the western port

of Parepare to Samarinda on the
Indonesianhalf of Borneo island.
At least 22 people, including four
crew members, were rescued from
the sea by fishermen Sunday before
the military launched an operation
at daybreak Monday. Indonesians
generally don't know how to swim,
and the others on board were
feared dead.
COLUMBUS, Ohio.
Storm blankets
p snow across New
England, Midwest
A weekend winter storm blan-
keted parts of the Midwest and
Northeast with up to a foot of snow,
causing a 59-vehicle pileup and at
least four traffic fatalities.
In New Hampshire, three buses
*nd two tractor-trailer rigs were
among 59 vehicles that crashed
on snowy Interstate 93, sending a
dozen people to hospitals Sunday
morning and temporarily shutting
down a stretch of the highway's
northbound lanes.
None of the injuries were life
threatening, but it took emergency
crews about an hour to remove one
man from a car wedged under the
back of a tractor trailer, Derry Fire
Battalion Chief Jack Webb said.
A car that slid on ice caused a
33-car pileup yesterday afternoon
near Greenwich, Conn., sending
two people to the hospital and clos-
ing the northbound side of Inter-
state 95 for two hours.

Isr aeli forces advance deep
into urban areas inGaza

Israeli navy fires
more than 25 shells
at Gaza City
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)
- Israeli ground forces made
their deepest foray yet yesterday
into Gaza's most populated area,
with tanks rolling into residential
neighborhoods and infantry fight-
ing urban warfare in streets and
buildings with Hamas militants
who kept up their rocketing of
southern Israel.
An Israeli army spokeswoman
said residential neighborhoods in
Gaza are riddled with homemade
bombs and booby traps, including
mannequins placed at apartment
entrances to simulate militants
and rigged to explode if soldiers
approach.
The army "is advancing more
into urban areas," said the spokes-
woman, Maj. Avital Leibovich.
"Since the majority of the Hamas
militants are pretty much in hid-
ing in those places, mainly urban
places, then we operate in those
areas."
Late yesterday, dense plumes
of smoke from explosions rose
over Gaza City and heavy gunfire
was heard just south of the city.
Early today, Israeli navy gun-
boats fired more than 25 shells
at Gaza City, setting fires and
shaking office buildings, includ-
ing the local bureau of The Asso-
ciated Press. The military said
that in general, the targets are
Hamas installations but had no
immediate information about
the shelling that began just after
midnight.
Gaza medical officials say at
least 870 Palestinians, about half
of them civilians, have been killed
in the conflict that began Dec. 27
with Israeli airstrikes on Hamas
buildings, as well as suspected

rocket launch sites and smuggling
tunnels on the Egyptian border.
Thirteen Israelis, including 10 sol-
diers, have died.
German and British envoys
pressed efforts to negotiate an
end to the war even though Israel
and Hamas have ignored a U.N.
Security Council resolution call-
ing for an immediate and durable
cease-fire.
Outgoing Prime Minister Ehud
Olmert said Israel had made prog-
ress in its objectives in the Gaza
offensive but was not finished yet.
"Israel is nearing the goals
that it set for itself," Olmert said.
"However, further patience, deter-
mination and effort are necessary
in order to achieve those goals in a
way that will change the security
reality in the south."
While Olmert's comment sig-
naled no immediate end to the
offensive, it indicated that Israel
is wary of an open-ended con-
flict with an unclear agenda.
Israel wants to end years of rocket
attacks by Hamas on its south-
ern population, a complex goal
that could require Egyptian or
international help in shutting off
routes to smuggle weapons into
Gaza from Egypt. Israel has been
bombing tunnels that run under
the Egypt-Gaza border.
In ane-mail message early Mon-
day, Hamas leader Ismail Radwan
said his group would not consider
a cease-fire before Israel stops its
attacks and pulls back from Gaza.
He also demanded the opening of
all border crossings, emphasizing
the Rafah crossing with Egypt.
That would relieve economic
pressure on the destitute terri-
tory but also strengthen Hamas'
control of Gaza, an odious pros-
pect for Israelis who fear a halt
to the fighting will just give
Hamas another opportunity to
re-arm. .t
In Cairo, Egypt's state-owned

news agency reported progress in
truce talks with Hamas, but pro-
vidednospecifics.TheMiddleEast
News Agency quoted an unnamed
Egyptian official as saying talks
between the nation's intelligence
chief, Omar Suleiman, and Hamas
envoys were "positive."
Palestinian medical officials
reported about 60 deaths on Sun-
day, including 17 who had died of
wounds suffered on previous days.
Most of those killed Sunday were
noncombatants, medical officials
said, including four members of
one family killed when a tank shell
hit their home near Gaza City, and
a 10-year-old girl killed in a simi-
lar attack.
Palestinian witnesses said
Israeli troops moved to within
half a mile of Gaza City's south-
ern neighborhoods, and within
a quarter mile of the northern
neighborhood of Sheikh Ajleen.
Firefights in Sheikh Ajleen
erupted before dawn as Israeli
forces advanced toward Gaza City,
home to 400,000 people, Pales-
tinian witnesses said. The battles
were still in progress nearly a full
day later, though tanks pulled
back, with the Israelis in control
of some buildings on the neigh-
borhood's outskirts.
"We are safe, but we don't know
m for how long," said Khamis Alawi,
44, who huddled with his wife and
six children in their kitchen over-
night. He said bullets riddled his
walls and several came in through
the windows.
Military analysts say Israeli
troops are probing territory, clear-
ing buildings and moving around
regularly, rather than digging into
positions that would allow Hamas
militants to get a fix on their
whereabouts and lay ambushes.
Israel risks losing the advantage
of armor and heavy firepower in
urban settings that the militants
know well.

GM highlights 17
new vehicles in auto
show pep rally
DETROIT (AP) - We're dif-
ferent, and our new stuff is really
good. In a nutshell, that's what
General.Motors, Ford and Chrysler
tried to tell consumers - and tax-
payers - yesterday as they rolled
out an array of new vehicles at the
North American International
Auto Show.
They told their stories in differ-
ent ways, with Chrysler LLC mak-
ing its senior executives available
to assure people that it remains a
viable company. General Motors
Corp. held a pep rally with hun-
dreds of cheering employees and
supporters who watched a parade
of 17 new and upcoming vehicles.
Ford Motor Co. emphasized its
plans for electric vehicles, joining
the list of automakers that have
promised one next year.
The fanfare, on opening day of
the Detroit show's press preview,
comes after a year of dismal sales
that forced GM and Chrysler to get
$17.4 billion in federal loans to stay
alive. Ford doesn't need money
now but says it might in 2010 if
U.S. sales don't improve.
But industry analysts say the
automakers could still be in trou-
ble thisryear if U.S. auto sales don't
recover. Several are predicting
annual sales of around 10.5 mil-
lion - almost 6 million below 2007
levels - as consumers delay major
purchases due to economic uncer-
tainty. In the third quarter of last
year, GM and Ford each spent
more than $1 billion per month
above their income.
Yesterday, the U.S.-based auto-
makers touted new products with
a focus on fuel efficiency that they
say will help return them to finan-
cial health and ensure that their
cars and trucks will roll off assem-
bly lines for years to come.
GM said it would build a
40-mile-per-gallon minicar for
the U.S. market, and it unveiled
an electric-powered Cadillac
concept car.
Ford announced plans to put a
battery-powered commercial van
on the market in 2010, with an
electric car coming a year later,
followed by plug-in versions of
its gas-electric hybrid vehicles in
2012.

Chrysler showed off a sleek new
midsize electric concept car called
the 200C, and one of its executives
said it could be the inspiration for
a new midsize car to compete with
Toyota's top-selling Camry.
Chrysler CEO Robert Nardelli
told reporters that while its key
new products won't show up in
dealer showrooms until next
year, the Auburn Hills automak-
er expects to survive 2009 and
remain an independent company.
Yet many analysts say that
because of Chrysler's 30 percent
sales drop last year and 53 percent
decline in December, and a model
Lineup that doesn't change signifi-
cantly this year, the company will
be forced to sell itself to another
automaker or be sold off in pieces
by majority owner Cerberus Capi-
tal Management LP, a New York
private equity firm.
Chrysler Vice Chairman Jim
Press said dealers are report-
ing they are losing 25 percent of
sales in showrooms due to a lack
of available credit, and says sales
will improve if credit loosens. He
also said the December sales drop
was due to an intentional cut in
low-profit sales to rental car com-
panies and other fleet buyers.
Nardelli said the company came
out with the new Dodge Ram
pickup, Journey crossover and
Challenger sports car in 2008, all
excellent products that should sell
in abetter economic environment.
GM CEO Rick Wagonersaid his
company's restructuring plans
submitted to Congress, which
include concessions from the
United Auto Workers union and
other cost cuts, combined with
GM's lineup of new products,
will make the company prosper
when the worldwide auto market
recovers.
"We'll be in a position to run
the business at break-even or prof-
itable at a much, much smaller
industry than frankly a year ago
that we ever felt would be possible
to deal with," Wagoner said.
The new vehicles GM intro-
duced Sunday included the Chev-
rolet Spark subcompact, which
was called the Beat when GM
unveiled it as a concept car: in
2007. The three-door hatchback
with a 1.2-liter turbocharged
engine is about the size of a Honda
fit or Toyota Yaris and is set to go
on sale in Europe next year and in
the U.S. in 2011.

Senate Democrats respond to
request for unspent $350B

Bush, Obama team
up to obtain unused
bailout funds
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen-
ate Democrats prepared yester-
day to answer a request for the
remaining $350 billion in financial
industry bailout funds as the Bush
administration and President-
elect Obama undertook atag-team
effort to obtain the money from
reluctant lawmakers.
A vote in Congress is likely as
early as this week, several sena-
tors predicted after receiving a
rare briefing yesterday from top
Obama economic adviser Larry
Summers on the Wall Street bail-
out, as well as on Obama's sepa-
rate $800 billion-or-so economic
recovery plan.
President Bush would request
the additional money for the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, or
TARP, but the incoming adminis-
tration would make the case for it
by laying out a series of changes
in how the program is run. More
of the money would go directly
to relieve homeowners threat-
ened with foreclosure, said Senate
Banking Committee Chairman
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. A full-
er accounting of the money already
spent is needed as well, Dodd said.
"Larry Summers made a very
strong argument for why it's
important and critical for the
overall recovery," said Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass. "And I think that's
an argument that most senators
understand."

Summers sought to win over
Senate Democrats even as the
GOP leader of the House, John
Boehner of Ohio, warned that any
effort to release the additional
money would "be a pretty tough
sell." Boehner appeared on CBS'
"Face The Nation."
A request would force a vote
within days on whether to block
the funding, but the deck is stacked'
in favor of Bush and Obama win-
ning release of the remaining $350
billion. Congress can pass a reso-
lution disapproving the request,
but the White House could veto
the resolution; then, just one-
third of either chamber would be
needed to uphold the veto and win
release of the money. Senate lead-
ers would prefer to win a majority
vote, Dodd said.
The idea is to make the money
available to the new administra-
tion shortly after Obama takes
office Jan. 20. The unpopular bail-
out has featured unconditional
infusions of money into financial
institutions that have done little to
reveal what they've done with it.
Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson originally promised the
money would be used to buy up
toxic mortgage-related securities
whose falling values have clogged
up credit markets and brought
many financial institutions to the
brink of failure.
Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid indicated Sunday that Bush
and Obama officials are near
agreement on submitting notice to
Congress about using the remain-
ing $350 billion.
"We're waiting to hear from

President Bush and or President-
elect Obama as to what, if any-
thing, they're going to do," said
Reid, D-Nev., "and that's occur-
ring as we speak."
"The likelihood is that we'll
have some kind of vote on that
somewhere in the course of the
week," Kerry said.
But to prevail, Obama and his
team must soothe senators who
feel burned by the way the Bush
administration has used the
TARP.
"The (incoming) administra-
tion ... is going to fundamentally
alter how this is being managed,"
Dodd said. "The concept is still very
sound andsolid and it is needed. But
it's not going to pass around here
unless there's a strong commitment
to foreclosure mitigation."
Dodd said lawmakers were
demanding other conditions, such
as more concrete steps to limit
executive compensation and make
recipients of the funds be more
accountable.
The Congressional Oversight
Panel raised detailed questions
last week about how banks are
spending the first $350 billion,
how the money will combat the
rising tide of home foreclosures
and Treasury's overall strategy
for the rescue. In instance after
instance, the panel said, the Trea-
sury Department did not offer
adequate responses.
In an interview aired Sunday on
ABC's "This Week," Obama said
he has asked his economic team
to develop a set of principles to
ensure more openness about how
the money is spent.

Room for research
Pfizer property a good investment for the University
While students were away on winter break, the Univer-
sity bought itself a holiday gift: the abandoned 174-
acre Pfizer Inc. facility near North Campus. Overall,
the $108 million acquisition is a welcome addition to the Univer-
sity - the Pfizer property will enhance the University's ability
to do cutting-edge research at a time when attracting innova-
tion and jobs to the state is more important than ever. But it also
comes at a cost. The deal has angered the city this university
relies on - a sentiment the University needs to smooth over.

a

That would be his first mistake in office.
I'd have to skunk him."
- Kevin Johnson, Sacramento's mayor'and former guard for the Phoenix Suns, on the prospect of President-
elect Barack Obama challenging him to a basketball game, as reported yesterday by the New York Times.
Asking the tough questions

Formerly the largest private sector
employer and largest taxpayer in Ann
Arbor, Pfizer hit the city and the Univer-
sity hard when it decided to close its doors
last January. For the city, the firm's cost-
cutting measure caused about 2,100 people
to lose their jobs locally and about 5 per-
cent of Ann Arbor's tax revenue to vanish.
For the University, students and research-
ers suddenly lost job opportunities.
During the past year, filling Pfizer's cam-
pus with someone has been a priority. But
when no other major player expressed seri-
ous interest, the University decided to step
in to purchase the abandoned Pfizer build-
ing. For that, everyone should be somewhat
thankful. The University plans to employ
about 2,000 workers at the facility, bring-
ing the type of highly skilled jobs to Ann
Arbor that Michigan needs to reinvent its
largely auto-dominated economy.
Michigan's universities have a natural
place at the forefront of Michigan's tran-
sition, especially now that they have a
relative economic advantage. Last month,
Michigan State University did its part
when it was awarded the Facility for Rare
Isotope Beams by the Department of Ener-
gy, improving its appeal to research scien-
tists. The University's investment in the
30-building campus demonstrates a simi-
lar commitment. Though the use of the
Pfizer labs has not yet been determined,
the research potential here is impressive
and will certainly aid Michigan's efforts to
recreate the economy based upon innova-
tive, technological development.

The loser in this deal, though, is the
city of Ann Arbor. Because the University
doesn't pay property taxes to the city like
Pfizer used to, the city just lost its largest
taxpayer with no hope of getting it back.
Though the University will bring in new
high-paying jobs, that's still a $5.1 million
hole the city has to fill. On top of that, the
city government is already suffering from
budget problems that have caused it to pro-
pose dramatic budget cuts. It's tough not
to see the University as somewhat of a vul-
ture, here, swooping in to buy up the Pfizer
facility during tough economic times.
But while the short-term picture for
the city is discouraging, a tax-exempt,
functional facility bringing in jobs to Ann
Arbor is preferable to an abandoned one.
In the long-run, the Pfizer purchase is
a necessary way to improve the Univer-
sity's capacity for research - important
research that will allow the University
and the state to compete for the top minds
in the country. The Pfizer resources will
attract skilled workers - and consequent-
ly, businesses - to Ann Arbor and enable
it to lead the research that is vital for the
state's economic recovery.
In such a trying time for Michigan's"
economy, state universities must do their
part by educating the future-work-force
and by attracting the best and the bright-
est to our state. The University is doing
its part by turning the abandoned Pfizer
facility into something that will be benefi-
cial for the economic outlook of the entire
state of Michigan.

ob Parker probably deserved to
get fired - but not like this.
The now-former Detroit
News sports col-
umnist was forced
to resign last week,
shortly after his
controversial ques-
lions directed at
now-fired Detroit
Lions head coach
Rod Marinelli.
Parker has been a IMRAN
mediocre colum-
nist and analyst SYED
of Detroit sports -
for years, and I'm
actually surprised the News kept him
around as long as it did. I'm astound-
ed, however, that - having survived
so many years with shoddy insights
and writing - Parker was forced to
resign because of a rare instance of
brave, responsive reporting.
The event in question took place
during the post game news confer-
ence with Marinelli following the
Lions's embarrassing 42-7 home loss
to the New Orleans Saints on Dec.
21. The loss made the Lions 0-15 for
the season, just one loss away from
"achieving" the first winless season
the NFL has seen since going to the
16-game format.
Parker - as he often does, and not
always wisely - decided to address
a topic others would consider too
dangerous. Whereas every other'
reporter in the room stood mesmer-
ized by Marinelli's poise and humil-
ity following another crushing defeat,
Parker chose to set aside compassion
and personal feelings and ask atough
question that he thought had to be
asked.
The subject he chose to question
was the Lions defensive coordinator,
Joe Barry. It was an entirely reason-
able line of questioning, given the
following: The Lions had the worst
defense in the league in terms of total
yards and points surrendered - it

wasn't even close - and yet the defen-
sive coordinator still had his job.
I think we can all agree that
it shouldn't matter that Barry is
Marinelli's son-in-law - if he's a bad
coordinator, then he's a bad coordi-
nator - but for some reason, it mat-
tered a lot. Parker tried to steer the
conversation to why Barry still had a
job, and Marinelli, like the good sol-
dier he was in Vietnam all those years
ago, continued to take the hits himself
and protect his charge, who also hap-
pened to be his son-in-law.
I admit that I'm amazed at how
much class and control Marinelli
showed throughout a miserable sea-
son of excruciatingpress conferences.
Not once did he ever lose his cool or
blame someone else. That's all good,
but it doesn't justify dodging a rele-
vant question, and that's exactly what
Marinelli was doing that day.
Parker's final question, the one that
allegedly crossed the line was this:
"On a lighter note, do you wish your
daughter married a better defensive
coordinator?" The question's very
premise indicates it wasn't a serious
jab. Parker even prefaced that ques-
tion with "on a lighter note," so for-
give me if I fail to see how that crosses
the line at all.
Parker was universally criticized
afterward for allegedly "making it
personal," but his self-righteous crit-
ics (most of them dim-witted, ex-
question-dodging meatheads like
Terry Bradshaw) missed one impor-
tant point: It was Marinelli who chose
to, make it personal the day he hired
his son-in-law as defensive coordina-
tor.
As one of the few Lions fans who
watched every game and absorbed
every bit of analysis throughout this
horrific season, I, of all people, should
have known that Barry was Marinel-
li's son-in-law. And yet, up until the
moment Parker asked that question,
I and likely thousands of others had
no idea that was the case. While I'm

sure that superbly relevant point was
reported somewhere sometime, the
majority of reporters and analysts
avoided it out of fear that it crossed a
line.
And that's what reporting has
become these days. Reporters are
still good at their jobs and know how
to dig, but suddenly there's a fear
about pursuing certain facets of the
truth. Whether it's something rela-
tively trivial on the grand scale like
Marinelli's son-in-law or something
with much higher stakes (wars and
weapons of mass destruction, for
instance), the media simply seems to
have lost its appetite for responsive-
ness and accountability. Instead, the
Journalists
shouldn't fear
"crossing the line."
media has developed love for what I
it covers (see: Barack Obama) - and
that's unacceptable.
Sure, the media is indeed sup-
posed to have a heart. It's supposed
to have a heart for rape victims and
whistleblowers who need anonym-
ity. It isn't supposed to have a heart
for public figures who screw up and
then are spared scrutiny because
personal issues might have somehow
been involved. That's simply a case
of the media failing in its fundamen-
tal, fourth estate purpose. No wonder
newspapers everywhere are failing.
Rob Parker did something right
that day. He may have been a prick,
but that's often the job of a reporter. It
would be great if more reporters got
to work once again.

Conservatives shouldn't panic

4

As liberals party in the street, celebrat-
ing Barack Obama's upcoming inauguration,
Republicans are just trying to cope. Around
the country, conservatives are walking around
in various states of misery ranging from mild
dejection to full-blown depression. As a young
conservative - something of an elusive group
on this campus - I have tried to funnel my
sense of impending doom into optimism,
despite my serious concerns about the Demo-
cratic Party's ability to successfully manage
the national budget and Obama's lack of expe-
rience with foreign policy in an increasingly
globalized world.
But, despite our collective concerns, Repub-
licans can't just head toward the nearest, deep-
est, darkest cave and stay there until Obama's
time in office ends. Now, more than ever,
Republicans have a responsibility to inject a
sense of practicality into the often overly-ide-
alistic liberal mentality.
Liberals, in their euphoria, rush to compare
Obama with Franklin D. Roosevelt. However,
they tend to overlook some of the less heralded
similarities between the two. During FDR's
campaign, respected political commentator
Walter Lippmann said that FDR was "a pleas-
ant man, who, without any important qualifica-
tions for the office, would very much like to be
President." Lippmann meant his comment as an
attack on FDR, but I think that FDR's desire to
be president may have been one of his best qual-
ifications. Similarly, Obama's noble intentions
may be one of his greatest strengths. Despite
his troubling lack of experience, Obama seems
to be a man who wants to be president because
he truly believes that he can make a difference.
I find no fault with this and I respect him for
his sincerity.
Obama won the presidency because he prom-
ised Americans the unity we have so desperate-
ly craved since becoming divided over the war
in Iraq. He promised hope, something we have
been in short supply of in recent years. More

importantly, he promised America a resurrec-
tion of the sense of pride that we seem to have
lost in such a controversial war.
But these are just ideas, vague abstractions
that have heart but not mind behind them. Con-
trary to the popular cliche, ideas don't change
the world - actions do. That's where the
Republican Party comes in. It's the job of the
Republican Party to temper Obama's idealism
with practicality. Everyone wants our planet
to remain beautiful, our citizens to be healthy
and happy, and our credit on the world stage to
be restored to the glory it has preserved for so
long. It's the place of the Republican Party to
make these things happen for everyone but also
to remind Democrats in government that the
extreme legislation they favor isn't always real-
istic, that personal responsibility must be treat-
ed more seriously and that this country must be
ready to defend itself against people whose hate
runs deeper than diplomacy can reach.
That means, however, that Republicans are
going to have to work with the Obama Admin-
istration. That's right - I said it. Republicans
in the legislature do not have the right to spend
the next four years doing everything in their
power to force Democrat-sponsored legisla-
tion to die. Republicans have a responsibility to
their constituents to work with the administra-
tion and actually get legislation passed that can
benefit everyone. Negotiation, as distasteful as
that might sound, mustbe the Republican's tool
of choice.
So, my fellow conservatives, put that spe-
lunking gear away and stay out of that cave. The
next four years might be rough, but they will be
vital for the GOP. It's time for the Republican
Party to pull itself together and show America
that it's not made up of stuffy, bitter, old white
men. And, hey, look on the bright side: it's only
four years - hopefully.

Manly in all the
wrong places

More and more channels
these days are develop-
ing specific niches, and
the program-_
ming that fits
these new
images tends to
be very strong.
But when
these channels
try to create
programming JAME
outside of their BLOCK
stated purpose in
order to appeal to
specific demographics, they often
create some awful programing.
While not every television show
targets a specific gender, they
almost all end up appealing to
one gender more than the other.
When one station compiles sev-
eral of these male-leaning shows
with shows that are purposefully
aimed at men, it's not surprising
that the channel attracts a pretty
homogenous viewership.
Two channels where this has
certainly happened are Comedy
Central and G4, For those who
don't know, G4 is a channel spe-
cializing in all things video games,
Internet, comics, gadgetry, and
sci-fi. It also airs reruns of "Lost"
and "Heroes." Basically, it's a
channel about everything I love.
As for Comedy Central, I'm going
to assume you all know what it is,
or, if you don't, that you can come
up with a pretty good guess. And
to those of you who are already
objecting, saying "The Daily
Show" and perhaps "The Colbert
Report" appeal to both genders
equally, you're probably right
about that. But for every "Daily
Show" on Comedy Central, there
are several shows like "Reno 911!"
These two channels appeal
mainly to men, particularly ado-
lescents and the adolescent at
heart. That fact isn't especially
shocking, nor is ita bad thing on
its own. But when these channels
examine gender-related viewing
trends and try to cater to male
viewers with shows outside their
pre-existing niches, the results
can be agonizingly poor:
From Comedy Central, the
obvious example is "The Man
Show," which aired from 1999
to 2004 - five years too many.
I admit that the show was, in
theory, supposed to be funny.
Everything on the show was
done in sketch-comedy form, but
because so much focus was put on
cleavage, no attention was given
to making the show genuinely
amusing. Plus, it was created and
originally co-hosted by the unfun-
ny-to-the-degree-of-inducing-
nausea Jimmy Kimmel ("Jimmy
Kimmel Live!").
To put it simply, "The Man
Show" could be the worst show
ever created by Comedy Central.
And I've seen "Strangers with
Candy," "Drawn Together," and
even, I'm ashamed to admit, "I'm
With Busey," featuringnone other
than the ever-bothersome Gary
Busey himself ("Maneater"). If
you haven't seen any of those
shows, save yourself the anguish.
If you have, you know I'm mak-
ing a very strong claim. "The Man
Show" was that bad.
For G4, the show I think best
exemplifies man-pandering is a lit-
tle less obvious. My choice is none
other than "Hurl!," a hybrid game
show created in 2008 that com-
bines an eating competition with
body-wrenching extreme sports (if

you consider getting rapidly spun

around an extreme sport). You can
guess from the show's name what
the desired result of juxtaposing
these two activities is. I'm aware
that the word "man" never appears
when describing what the show's
about, but it doesn't take a stretch
of the imagination to link exces-
sive quantities of food, athleticism
and vomit to a prdominantly male
audience.
And, of course, "Hurl!" is awful.
But honestly, I don't think there
could ever be a decent game show
where puking is the method of
elimination. So how did a show
this bad get aired alongside such
greats as "Lost," "Attack of the
Show" and the must-see Japanese
import "Ninja Warrior"? Ah, the
power of unchecked testosterone.
I don't have an ideological prob-
lem with the existence of shows
like "The Man Show" or "Hurl!"
If people want to watch that kind
of thing, I give them my blessing.
But I think that these shows have
a specific time and place, and nei-
ther Comedy Central nor G4 is that
place. But never fear. A safe haven
for this kind of programming does
exist, and its name is Spike.
From the moment TNN
announced that it was changing
its name to Spike TV, the network
began proclaiming itself to be
first channel aimed directly (and
unflinchingly) at men. This is
evidenced by current Spike shows
with names like "MANswers,"
"MuscleCar" and "Cock + Load,"
desiring instead to focus even
more closely on male-oriented
programming. The channel has
recently stopped airing classics
like "Ren and Stimpy" or "Robot
Wars," each of which would fit in
perfectly on more gender-neutral
channels like Comedy Central and
G4, respectively. And even though
I would've liked to catch reruns
of those shows, I approve whole-
heartedly of the decision to target
a specific demographic.
Vomit makes bad
shows worse.
When Spike abandoned some
of its more nerd-friendly and
comedic efforts, it was solidifying
its niche. On a channel designed
specifically for men- the burlier
the better - there's no reason to
air Nickelodeon shows or shows
about dinky little robots. Spike is
about men doing manly things,
like driving big cars, kicking peo-
ple in the ass (with Battle Pope),
looking at cleavage, eating and
vomiting. Comedy Central and G4
are not.
So to these two wayward chan-
nels, I say this: Sure, a lot more
men watch you than women. But
please don't act any differently as
a result. You are perfect just the
way you are. Comedy Central: You
and I have had some great laughs
together ever since I was just a wee
lad. And G4: Even though we've
only known each other a few short
years, we've already formed a truly
emotional bond over video games
and gadget news. So don't be jeal-
ous of Spike just because it might
be bigger and stronger than you.
When I need to be entertained, I'll
be visiting you two first.
Block has his first date with
G4 tonight. Tell him what to

wear at jamblock Stumichedu.

Co. retiree and a recent widower.
To his disappointment, his son sells
foreign cars, his grandkids have no
decency and he's newly surrounded
by Asian neighbors. So, unsurpris-
ingly, Walt's a grumpy old man.
But when a Hmong teen named
Thao (newcomer Bee Vang) is dared
to steal Walt's prized green Ford
Gran Torino, everything begins to
change for Walt. What begins as
satire turns into a culture clash.
After nearly shooting Thao dur-
ing the attempted car theft, Walt
later saves him from the gang that
provoked Thao to steal the Tori-

twist of fate, Walt later befriends
Thao and becomes a mentor and
protector for the young man, his
sister and his family. In turn, Walt
begins to learn about the Hmong
culture, and more importantly, he
starts to change. Sure, he fights
with his priest, his barber and his

own health, but by interacting with
Thao and his family, Walt reorga-
nizes himself for the better.
Walt later teaches Thao the
value of good, old-fashioned crafts-
manship and courtesy, which
are refreshingly simple themes
throughout the film. But Thao's
earnestness and sincerity teach
Walt about the need to confide in
others and not judge people simply
by their race or age. The themes
may superficially feel redundant,
but placed in a realistic 21st centu-
ry context, they feel new again.
Eventually, tensions escalate
between Walt and the Asian gang.
All the while, Walt does everything
he can to teach Thao what it means
to be a man. The film speeds up
to a heartbreaking climax. "Gran
Torino" showcases Eastwood's in
his supposed last acting role, and
naturally it offers a certain kind of

Forgettable sHaymaker!'
4just can 't find its target

By JEFF SANFORD
Daily Arts Writer
The Gourds are a band born out of the
proud Austin, Texas music
scene. And, like many of
their hometown brethren, *
the members take their Lone
Star tradition very seriously. The Gourds
Within the first seconds of "Haymaker!"
Haymaker! vocalist Kevin
Russell announces "Wake
up, we goin' to the country"
while his guitar unleashes some serious down-
home twang. Surprisingly, there's no follow-up
"yeeeeehaw," but the message is clear from the
beginning: as the title of the first song sug-
gests, the album is all about "Country Love."
But while this sort of mentality works a
special magic in the whiskey-soaked bars of
downtown Austin, The Gourds suffer when
their sound is taken out of the roadhouse and
constrained to an album. Outside of a live con-
text, there is no carefree bar ambiance or char-
ismatic stage presence for the band to fall back
on. Unfortunately, these things are essential to
the appeal of bands like The Gourds, who play
standard, jaunty blues tunes and don't have the

grace or originality to survive on musical merit
alone. Listening to Haymaker! is like listening
to a Soulja Boy song quietly at home - it just
doesn't feel right.
Despite the nagging feeling that some vital
component is missing, Haymaker! shows
fleeting signs of songwriting prowess. "Fos-
sil Contender" boasts a sing-along chorus and
showcases the strength of Russell's gravelly
voice that at times captures all the blue-collar
conviction of Springsteen. The band sows its
country roots on "All the Way to Jericho," a
swaggering gospel number that's endearing
enough to break up the monotony that defines
the rest of Haymaker!.
While there are moments where enough ol'
timey charm comes through to pique listener
interest, there are far too nany tracks that
seem to revel in the generic. It's difficult to sit
through long.stretches of Haymaker! without
the word "bland" constantly coming to mind,
and its just as hard to shake the feeling you've
heard this same freewheeling alt-country act
before. Sometimes it's possible to completely
forget music is playing at all - the deluge of
noise simply drifts into the background, but
not in a pleasant, atmospheric way. It's more
like how an incessant car alarm gradually

becomes unnoticeable.
Aftermore than a decade ofplaying together,
The Gourds are growing old and their chances
of making a real impact on music are slipping
away. Aside from being the apple of many an
Austinite's eye, The Gourds owe a great deal
of success to their irresistible bluegrass cover
All of the blue-collar
conviction of Bruce
Springsteen, with none
of the benefits.
of Snoop Dogg's "Gin and Juice." It's a shame,
then, that they couldn't take the innovation
shown in that cover and apply it to their own
original music. They're clinging to some rigid-
ly defined mold, afraid to write outside of what
they think they should sound like. Unfortu-
nately, that's just what they need to do if they
want to progress in today's music world.

Peanut butter recalled
after salmonella found

SHREDDING IN THE ARB

Lab tests show
bacteria in 5-pound
tub of King Nut
peanut butter
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -
An Ohio distributor says it has
recalled two brands of its peanut
butter after an open container
tested positive for salmonella
bacteria.
Federal health officials said
the company's peanut butter had
not been conclusively linked to a
national salmonella outbreak.
King Nut Companies said in a
statement that it asked custom-
ers to stop distributing all peanut
butter under its King Nut and
Parnell's Pride brands with a lot
code that begins with the numer-
al9"8.")
The peanut butter was distrib-
uted only through food service
providers in Ohio, Michigan,
North Dakota, Minnesota, Arizo-
na, Idaho, New Hampshire, Mas-
sachusetts and Florida. It was not
sold directly to consumers.
Preliminary laboratory test-
ing found salmonella bacteria in
a 5-pound container of King Nut
brand creamy peanut butter, the
i Minnesota Department of Health
said Friday.
The Minnesota tests had not
linked it to the type of salmonella
in the outbreak that has sickened
almost 400 people in 42 states,
but the department said addition-
al results are expected early next

week.
The federal Food and Drug
Administration also is analyzing
samples of peanut butter from
King Nut and Peanut Corporation,
spokeswoman Stephanie Kwisnek
said Sunday. The agency has not
conclusively linked the peanut
butter to the strain of salmonella
that has sickened people in the
outbreak, she said.
King Nut's president, Mar-
tin Kanan, said Sunday that the
recall involved approximately
1,000 cases of peanut butter. He
said he did not know the names of
the company's customers, but he
planned to release more details
Monday.
"We don't know exactly where
they sell to," Kanan said. "They
could sell cross-state, too."
"We just want everybody to
know that safety is our highest
priority," Kanan said. "We ,just
wanted to recall it right away."
King Nut, based in Solon, Ohio,
said it canceled all orders with the
manufacturer of its two peanut
butter brands, Peanut Corpora-
tion of America, based in Lynch-
burg, Va.
Peanut Corporation said in
a statement posted on its Web
site that it is working with fed-
eral food and health officials to
determine whether its products
are connected to the national out-
break. PCA does not sell its prod-
ucts at grocery stores or directly
to the public.
The Lynchburg company said
the tainted container was found
in the kitchen of a nursing facil-

ity, leaving it open to the possibil-
ity of cross-contamination from
another source. The company did
not say where the nursing facility
was located or when the contami-
nated product was discovered.
Peanut Corporation's owner
and president, Stewart Parnell,
declined to comment further on
Sunday until the FDA and the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention complete their inves-
tigation.
CDC spokeswoman Berna-
dette Burden said Sunday that
she had no new information on
the case and did not know when
additional test results would be
available.
The CDC said Friday that 399
cases had been confirmed nation-
ally, with about one in five of vic-
tims hospitalized. California has
reported the most cases, with 55,
followed by Ohio with 53. All the
illnesses began between Sept. 3
and Dec. 29, but most of the peo-
ple grew sick after Oct. 1.
The CDC has not confirmed
any deaths associated with the
outbreak.
The report of peanut butter
contamination comes almost two
years after ConAgra recalled its
Peter Pan brand peanut butter,
which was eventually linked to
at least 625 salmonella cases in 47
states.
CDC officials say the bacte-
ria in the current outbreak has
been genetically fingerprinted as
the Typhimurium type, which is
among the most common sources
of salmonella food poisoning.

States fear case
could let criminals
'game the system'
BENNINGTON, Vt. (AP) - After
he was charged with hitting his girl-
friend in the face, career criminal
Michael Brillon sat in jail without
bail for nearly three years, going
through six public defenders before
beingtried for assault.
The delays paid off - for Brillon:
A Vermont court threw out his con-
viction and freed him from prison
last spring, saying his Sixth Amend-
ment right to a speedy trial had been
violated.
Now, the U.S. Supreme Court is
taking up the case this week, trying
to decide if delays caused by public
defenders can deprive a criminal
defendant of that right. In particu-
lar: Whether governments can be
blamed for such delays since they're
the ones who assign and p y the
lawyers for indigent defendants.
Forty states and 15 organiza-
tions - state governments, county
governments, the U.S. Conference
of Mayors, a victim's rights' group
- arebacking the Vermont prosecu-
tor's appeal of the ruling, worried
that if it stands criminal suspects
will try to game the system and get
the result Brillon did.
"You're greasing that slippery
slope," said David Parkhurst, an

attorney with the National Gov-
ernors Association, which filed a
friend-of-the-court brief in support
of the prosecutor's appeal. "That's
the big concern here."
Brillon, a 46-year-old construc-
tion worker whose criminal past
includes convictions for sexual
assault on a minor, felony obstruc-
tion of justice and cocaine posses-
sion, was charged with aggravated
domestic assault over the 2001 inci-
dent with his girlfriend, who was
the mother of his child.
Held withoutbail, his case inched
along as lawyer after lawyer asked
for postponements and eventually
withdrew or was replaced at Bril-
lon's request.
The first got an evidentiary hear-
ing postponed because he was mov-
ing his law practice. He was fired by
Brillon, who claimed the lawyer had
failed to communicate with him.
The second reported a conflict
of interest that prevented him from
contining - a day after he'd been
appointed.
The third quitaftertelling a judge
Brillon threatened his life during a
break in a hearing.
Brillon fired the fourth, and the
fifth quit, citing changes to his con-
tract with the state public defender's
office.
The sixth took the case to trial in
2004, whenfBrillonwas convictedand
sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison
because he was a habitual offender

with three prior felony convictions.
However, Brillon appealed on the
speedy trial claim, and the Vermont
Supreme Court ruled in hisfavor, say-
ing the delays were the fault of the
state. The ruling outraged victim's
rights' advocates and others, both
because Brillon was freed and for fear
that other suspects would take his
cue, hopingfor asimilar outcome.
"The motivation would certainly
be there," said Erica Marthage, one
of the Vermont prosecutors who
will appear at Tuesday's oral argu-
ment before the Supreme Court in
Washington.
Brillon's current lawyer, whose
position has been buttressed by
friend-of-the-court briefs by the
National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers and the American
Civil Liberties Union, acknowledg-
es that Brillon had a role in some of
the delays.
Still, says attorney William Nel-
son, the criminal justice system is
primarily responsible.
Brillon was without any appoint-
ed counsel at all for six months and
was held without bail for nearly
three years, despite telling judgeshe
wanted to go to trial, Nelson said.
The U.S. Solicitor General, repre-
senting the federal government, has
filed a brief denouncing the Vermont
ruling and is seeking permission to
use 10 minutes of prosecutor Christi-
na Rainville's allotted 30-minute oral
argument to make the case.

FILM REVIEW
A FAILED AT
TO REWR
HISTOR
Cruise's newest falters as a by-the-numi
By Noah Dean Stahl I Daily Arts

4

Long plagued by studio indeci-
sion, budget inflation and intense
media scrutiny, "Valkyrie" finally
made it to theaters. Produced and
distributed by United Artists, the
recently revived MGM mini-studio
now run by Tom
Cruise, the movie e
was initially set
for a summer Valky
release, then
February 2009, At Quality 16
then December and Showcase
26, 2008 before United Artists
finally finding
the silver screen
on Christmas Day. Questions about
Cruise's current box office appeal
and shake-ups at the studio -
Paula Wagner, Cruise's longtime
production partner and co-owner
of UA, resigned from her posi-
tion at the studio in August - had
"Valkyrie" on the ropes. In other
words, "Valkyrie" was an obvious
underdog long before its theatrical
release.
The movie stars Cruise as
another underdog: Colonel Claus
von Stauffenberg, the leader of a

plot within the German military to
assassinate Hitler. It is of nominal
importance to note that Cruise's
performance was quite sufficient.
Cruise is a proven actor, so an
adequate performance is pretty
much a given; unfortunately, even
a satisfactory performance from
an accomplished actor can't save a
movie like "Valkyrie."
In an attack on the German
front in Tunisia, Stauffenberg loses
an eye and several fingers, further
cementing his feelings of resent-
ment toward the Third Reich. He
is then recruited by Major Gen-
eral Henning von Tresckow (Ken-
neth Brannagh, "Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Secrets") and
General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill
Nighy, "Pirates of the Carribean:
At World's End"), members of an
organization bent on restoring
Germany's political prestige with
the upending of Hitler's Germany.
Whether the group cares about
Hitler's heinous crimes against
European Jews and millions more
is unclear; their plot to assassinate
the FOihrer appears solely focused

GRAN TORINO
From Page 5A
closure. But the conclusion is more
rich and rewarding than could ever
be expected.
Walt never connected with his
own sons, and his transference is
clear and fair. What does it mean to
be a man? Who the hell knows? But

by its ending, "Gran Torino" com-
municates all the right ideas about
livinga complete life.
Still, it's a crowd-pleaser at
its core; a film made for people to
laugh and cheer with. Newcomer
Nick Schenk's screenplay has great
heart and ideas, and Eastwood
gives everything perfect life in a
way only he can.
Legendary screenwriter Wil-
liam Goldman ("Butch Cassidy

and the Sundance Kid," "Absolute
Power") once wrote about how
genuine and lasting Clint East-
wood is, and he's absolutely right.
Goldman stated something to the
effect of: Eastwood is better, truer
and taller than any actor out there.
Stallones and Costners may rise
and fall, but Eastwood has direct-
ed and performed better than any
other Hollywood star. With that in
mind, "Gran Torino" could be the
sunset of a long and fruitful age of
film.
Eastwood may always be
regarded as the gun-toting Ameri-
can with the trademark rasp and
glint. But in the wake of "Gran
Torino," all of his movies may be
met with a new appreciation. East-
wood daringly acts his own age in
"Torino," and in the film he puts
his entire career in perspective.
The film works so well because
it's a parody, a serious drama and
a high-minded personal reflection

- all at once.
After seeing "Gran Torino,"
audiences might finally believe that
Eastwood is more self-conscious
than he shows about the works
with which he has been involved.
When he was making the "Dirty
Harry" films, the left demonized
him as the patron saint of lawless
violence. Yet, watching "Harry"
flicks after "Torino" reveals a rich-
er context. They depict a man with
an opinion who knew that by esca-
lating the grandiosity of each film,
people would see the fallible quali-
ties of stoic masculinity.
Yeah, Walt flexes his rifle with
a case of Pabst, but his journey is
as lovable as it is laughable. "Gran
Torino" is Clint Eastwood, more
skilled and aware than he's ever
been. And we may finally, actually
understand him. Like the man who
directed and starred in it, and the
car that gave it its title, the film is
an American classic.

It's hard to say which is more
worrying: what

says about the Homeland

"Homeland ABC
Security USA"
says about the
future of our nation's safety.
The show depicts different
subsections of the Department
of Homeland Security in action,
showing just how the American
government takes down the bad
guys and protects its citizens from
everything from cocaine to illegal
immigrants to imported bat meat.
But this is a look at homeland
security that may be more worry-
ing than it is enlightening.
It's not that the border patrol
officers, customs officers, TSA
officers and other homeland
security officials do a particu-
larly bad job on the show (if they
do, it wisely isn't being shown on
national television). It just seems
like these officers don't have their
prioritiesstraight;theyoftenseem
eager for smugglers and potential
terrorists to try to enter the coun-
try, simply because it would make
their jobs more fun. But even
when border security officers are
having the time of their lives lift-
ing pound after pound of cocaine
out of a spare tire, it still makes
for boring television.
In fact, the few moments that
were legitimately worth watching
were those when homeland secu-
rity was shed in a humorous light.
In one instance, a rather attractive
Swiss woman with belly-dancing
aspirations and no working visa
simply can't stand the detention
center, calling it "too ugly for me"
with alook of pure disdain. Anoth-
er incident involves a bratty teen
who can't believe his newly bought
tobacco pipes are being confiscat-
ed at the border, actually saying to
the officers, "(I) should've stuffed
them in my pants."
That's not to say it's a good
idea to go out and sass your local
customs officer, but it's pretty
entertaining for television's sake.
Of course, when the competitors
for the most exciting event in the
show range from officers screen-
ing packages for contraband meat
products to random citizens com-

plaining about airport security,
the "highlights" aren't particu-
larly thrilling.
One thing the show does that's
intelligent and commendable is
spend almost equal time covering
the Canadian and Mexican bor-
ders. This helps counter the mis-
conception that the United States
is purely focused on our neighbor
to the south. But the show some-
times gets redundant when the
same type of incident is shown
on both borders. And that's the
show's main flaw: There's just
not enough variety among the
segments. There are too many
drug busts and human smuggling
incidents, each less exciting than
the last. In the entire hour-long
episode, only three or so differ-
ent types of security threats are
represented.
With these rather routine
busts, the show tries to jazz
things up with cliffhangers. But
after officers' investigations,
x-rays and drug-sniffing dogs
have all indicated that there are
probably drugs in a tire, it's more
than a little ridiculous for the
voiceover to say, "What's inside
the spare tire? Officers are about
to find out." In case any of you are
shaking with anticipation about
what really was in the tire, it was
drugs. Shocking, I know.
"Homeland Security USA"
doesn't show anything the
American public didn't already
know about customs officers,
the TSA and the other branches
of the Department of Homeland
Security. While it wisely shies
Seriously, the
TSA is dull.
away from being pure propa-
ganda, the show still feels like a
failed attempt to glorify border
and customs security and make
people less annoyed when their
travel plans get interrupted for
a security screening. With no
real insight, action or suspense,
the only entertainment "Home-
land Security" provides is some
accidental comic relief. But the
phrase "My God, we have human
skulls here" is apparently coming
up later this season, so that could
be worth checking out.

'M' gets its revenge
in convincing sweep

Saturday
MICHIGAN 5, MIAMI1
Sunday
MICHIGAN 4, MIAMI 0


So, what does a sweep of
Miami mean, anyway?

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Editor
The goals weren't that flashy.
Unlike in previous weeks, hat
tricks didn't dominate head-
lines. And Wolverine coach Red
Berenson called one of the games
"ugly"
But even so, the Michigan hock-
ey team was dominant in a crucial
series sweep, soundly beating No.
6 Miami (Ohio) 5-1 Saturday and
4-0 Sunday in Yost Ice Arena. Fri-
day's game was postponed to Sun-
day afternoon due to weather and
structural damage to the arena.
Six weeks ago, the RedHawks
swept the Wolverines in Oxford in
a series where Michigan managed
just one goal - the same offensive
output Miami had this weekend.
After the pair of losses in Novem-
ber, Berenson lamented that some
of his players hadn't scored in over
amonth.

This time around, offense came
swiftly and easily with nine dif-
ferent Wolverines findingthe back
of the net in a surprising scoring
barrage - one that didn't include
the team's points leaders, Louie
Caporusso and Aaron Palushaj.
The Miami defense keyed in on
the duo, limiting them to just one
total assist.
"We got goals from some
unlikely sources," Berenson said
after Sunday afternoon's victory.
"It's not always your top scorers
who are going to score in games
like this. We didn't get a lot of
shots in the game. We just had
to whack and hack and make our
chances count."

career goal Sunday on a tic-tac-

All told, Michigan gained four

the first time the two teams faced

it's definitely just going to help us
push forward in the season."
But it's important not to get
caught up init and blow the sweep
of Miami out of proportion. This
doesn't mean the Wolverines

Blue destroys overmatched Iowa

MEN'S SOCCER
Marosevic signs
professional deal

By ANDY REID
Daily Sports Editor
No one, not even Michigan men's bas-
ketball coach John Beilein, could have pre-
dicted the Wolverines would be here at this
point in the season.
Let's take a second to recap. Michigan -
yes, the same team that's limped through
more than a decade of mediocrity; the
same team that managed a measly 10 wins
last year while losing a program-record
22 games; the same team that players and
coaches called a work in progress during
the preseason - is sitting in the top four of
the Big Ten after yesterday morning's 64-49
beatdown of Iowa.
After one of their best starts to conference
play in recent memory, the Wolverines are
being mentioned in the same breath as some
of the conference big shots, like Michigan
State and Wisconsin, who bested Michigan
by eight points on New Year's Eve.
And for good reason.
The victory over Iowa was the Wolver-
ines' (3-1 Big Ten, 13-3 overall) most com-
plete game since conference play began,
with both the offense and defense running
smoothly from the opening tipoff.
After less-than-stellar defensive perfor-
mances against teams like Wisconsin and
Illinois, Michigan totally shut down the
Iowa attack and limited the Hawkeyes to

just 16 first-half points. Almost exclusively
playing the Beilein-patented 1-3-1 zone,
the Wolverines defense looked hungry and
aggressive. It forced 12 total turnovers,
including one that led to a ridiculous four-
on-zero fastbreak that ended in a monster
jam by sophomore leading-scorer Manny
Harris.
"When (the 1-3-1 is) working, we stay
with it and keep it going - we don't want to
change it," junior DeShawn Sims said.
And it was obviously working yesterday.
At no point did the Hawkeyes (1-3,11-6) look
comfortable in their offensive set, often ten-
tatively passing the ball around the perim-
eter deep into the shot clock.
Where Michigan might have experi-
mented with a man-to-man set in previous
games, it stuck with the zone scheme for
most of the contest.
"You don't see it very often," explained
Beilein about his troublesome defensive
scheme. "It's hard for people to prepare for.
Sometimes. It's not even about a schemat-
ic thing. It's about just getting the ball in
the right areas, where the ball will bounce
our way."
But Michigan needs to take this win with
a grain of salt.

Tate, came out on the Crisler Arena court

Why FOX's coverage of
the BCS was atrocious

4

Calls to change the Bowl
Championship Series are now
louder than ever.
In Utah, the state's attorney
general is investigating the BCS
as a possible
violation of
federal anti-
trust law.
In an inter-
view with
The New York1
Times, Pres-
ident-elect
Barack Obama NATE
reiterated his SANDALS
desire to see a
playoff system
at college football's highest level.
But fortunately, he said bringing
change to the college gridiron
wouldn't be the top priority of
his administration.
A day before the "national
championship game," Texas Con-
gressman Joe Barton introduced
legislation that would eliminate
the BCS system, accordingto The
Associated Press.
Barton's legislation didn't even
suggest what type of system he'd
like to see in place of the BCS.
But his message was clear: the
current system is more represen-
tative of "B" and "S" than a fair
way to determine college foot-
ball's National Champion.
Even with all the talk about
changing the system, if recent
history teaches us anything, it's

that it will have little impact upon
university presidents, the people
who actually call 'the shots. So
next year, we're all likely to be in
the same place - having to swal-
low the inconsistency of a game
between two very good teams
who have been separated from
three or four other very good
teams by a few computers.
But there is one necessary
change the BCS needs to make
before the charade begins again
on Jan. 7, 2010 at the Rose Bowl:
Find a network other than FOX
to broadcast the game.
The display put on by play-by-
play man Thom Brennaman was
beyond disgusting.
Don't just take my word for
it. Here's Spencer Hall of the
Sporting News: "FOX puts on
an incompetent broadcast. No.
Incompetent doesn't cover how
inept their clodfooted work on
the BCS has been."
Anyone who had the displea-
sure of watching last week's
game with the sound on got to
hear Brennaman and company
pontificate on the greatness
that is Florida quarterback Tim
Tebow.
Did you know that Tebow
is the greatest football player,
teammate and person of all time?
If not, just call Brennaman. He'll
be happy to enlighten you.
Tebow could be a nice guy, and
he's certainly a good college foot-

ball player, but to have the play-
by-play announcer fawn over him
as some sort of messiah took it
way too far. It was a disservice to
millions of fans that just wanted
to watch a good football game.
Letting FOX broadcast the
BCS Championship game just
doesn't make sense. FOX doesn't
have a national contract to broad-
cast college football during the
season, and none of their broad-
cast crews are particularly adept
at calling the college game. Most
important, all of the research in
the world can't make up for a lack
of experience
Thankfully, ESPN put out the
big bucks to lock up TV rights for
the BCS starting in 2011. But col-
lege football fans deserve better
than the half-wits at FOX, even if
it's just for one more year.
The BCS and its supporters
will continue to cling to this
broken system instead of giving
the fans what they want, but the
least the BCS could do is make
sure that someone competent is
given the duty of broadcasting
the game to the entire world.
Obama has promised that
change will come to America as
soon as he is inaugurated in eight
days. Change must come to the
BCS, too, and it should start in
the broadcast booth.

Gymnasts want
nothing short of
national prominence
By COLT ROSENSWEIG
Daily Sports Writer
The Wolverines aren't going to
accept disappointment anymore.
Every year, the Michigan men's
gymnastics team begins with high
hopes, only to watch its goals slip
away in the postseason.
Only in the outstanding 2007
season did the team defy the low
expectations of the gymnastics
world by holding a No. 1 rank-
ing most of the year and finishing
fourth at the NCAA Champion-
ships.
This season, it's all about the Big
Ten and NCAA Championships.
The many intrasquad competitions
in the fall, the seemingly endless
workouts and conditioning and the
extra pressure each Wolverine has
heaped on himself at every oppor-
tunity are all designed to make the
team confident in clutch situations.
"Every single year, it gets more
intense in this gym," said assistant
coach Derek Croad, who has been
involved with the team since the
2002-03 season.
Each gymnast has added at least
one new, high-quality skill to his
repertoire and the entire team has
been staying at the gym longer and
working out harder since the sum-
mer.
"Since I've been at this school,
we have not collectively as a team
been staying this late, working this
hard," senior Ryan McCarthy said.
"Everyone's got a really focused,
positive attitude in the gym."

Unlike the vast majority of its
opponents, Michigan lost just two
seniors to graduation. Michigan
coach Kurt Golder said he believes
his team's experience and depth
are big parts of the overall improve-
ment he's seen since last April.
The Wolverines also have an eas-
ier schedule than in recent years.
Michigan won't face No. 2 Oklaho-
ma until NCAAs and only sees No.
1 Stanford once before then. Michi-
gan lost to both teams in 2008.
The squad also has one more bye
weekend than last year. The extra
break could be a mixed blessing,
because it could help Michigan add
difficulty and recuperate from nag-
ging injuries but could also inter-
rupt the gymnasts' competition
rhythm.
Matching up against weaker
teams like Iowa and Illinois-Chica-
go will also give Golder the oppor-
tunity to rest his top performers
and give some of his backups a
chance to compete.
The sixth-ranked Wolverines
have a little added motivation - at
the start of April, Michigan will
host the Big Ten Championships.
"It means a (championship) ring,
that's what it means!" said junior
co-captain David Chan of having
the meet in Ann Arbor. "No ques-
tion about it. No excuses, no noth-
ing. It means a ring."
Big Tens have been a major
stumbling block for the Wolverines
recently, with Michigan finishing
fourth each of the last three years.
Each season, the team was still try-
ing to recover its confidence after
an unsuccessful Pacific Coast Class
meet.
And except for 2007, when the
Wolverines were fourth, the NCAA
Championships haven't been much

better.
In 2006, the team failed to make
the Super Six and Michigan came
in sixth in 2008.
Those lapses are part of the rea-
son the gymnasts, captained by
Chan and redshirt junior Phil Gold-
berg, have been pushing themselves
to the brink. Intrasquads at prac-
tice were more frequent than ever..
In the fall, seniors Kent Caldwell
and Ryan McCarthy devised a sys-
tem where each gymnast declared
a goal for the week, then had just
one chance to accomplish it with
the entire team watching.
"You want to do something that's
a struggle for you," sophomore Ben
Baldus-Strauss said. "It pushes you
every week to find something-that
pushes you beyond the usual. Then,
when you have the extra support
from the whole team, with every-
one watching you, a lot of times you
can do things you didn't think you
could do."
Michigan will still face an uphill
battle when it comes to filling out
lineups for the rings and high bar,
two events that nearly every gym-
nast said may be a weakness. Nei-
ther lineup has much depth. On
rings, all connection bonuses have
been eliminated, forcing ring men 4
to increase their difficulty just to
maintain their start values.
Despite the physical and mental
difficulties ahead, the Wolverines
are working to maintain an upbeat,
positive attitude in the gym.
"I think we're going to be in the
best shape that we've ever been in,
and I think we're going to be in bet-
ter shape than any other team out
there," Goldberg said.
"We're working really hard and
we're going to be in the best shape
ever. Period."

After teaching himself the
sport Caesar thrives in A2

Freshman is finally
benefiting from solid
coaching support
By COLT ROSENSWEIG
Daily Sports Writer
Let's get this out of the way:
Yes, freshman Syque Caesar (pro-
nounced psych) is in a Psych class.
The interesting part of the story
is how he came to be taking psy-
chology classes at Michigan instead
of Florida International - and how
he put himself on the verge of break-
ing into the men's gymnastics team's
starting lineup.
At the start of September, few
would have tabbed Caesar as a force
to be reckoned with this year.
His arrival in Ann Arbor was
unlikely. For six months, his gym in
Florida didn't even have a high bar.
A set of rings was also slow in com-
ing, and the ancient pommel horse
belonged out to pasture.
For years, he switched gyms
annually, at one point making an
80-mile commute three days a week
to practice.
He applied to Michigan and was
admitted but planned to go to Flori-
dainternational,which doesn'thave
a varsity men's gymnastics team.
Fortuitously, a Florida coach at the
junior nationals tipped Michigan
coach Kurt Golder off about Caesar.
"We had to shake the bushes to
- get in contact with him," Golder

said. "One thing led to another, and
in the middle of the summer, he
jumped ship from Florida and came
here. ... It's all because one coach
just mentioned it."
With help from his father, a for-
mer professional soccer player in
Bangladesh, Caesar had coached
himself for the previous two years.
Caesar's talent was evident;
sophomore Chris Cameron, a fel-
low Floridian, used to see Caesar at
meets and wonder how far he could
go with good coaching. But teaching
yourself techniques and skills from
YouTube videos could only take him
so far.
With the Wolverines, Caesar
now has all the coaching he could
want. Not only are Michigan coach
Kurt Golder and three assistants all
available to him, but his 23 team-
mates are just as eager to share their
knowledge.
Caesar's transformation has
impressed every Wolverine.
"He came in here and had a little
gut on him, and a month later, it's
gone," fifth-year senior Paul Wood-
ward said. "He's just ripped. There's
somebody who's picked up more
skills than I can probably count
right now."
Even Caesar finds his progression
little hard to believe.
"I think I've improved on a scale,
like an unbelievable rate," Cae-
sar said. "I'm learning such high-
level skills that I never would have
dreamed of doing if I hadn't been
here."

But the first few weeks were
tough. He'd never had such intense 4
or lengthy workouts - or had so far
to walk just for classes.
"If I even looked at the high bar,
I'd rip," said Caesar, referring to
when the skin on a gymnast's hand
tears during high bar workouts.
But after about a month and a
half, he had settled into his new rou-
tine and everyone took notice.
Nearly all his teammates com-
mented on Caesar's exceptional
lines and beautiful style on floor,
vault and parallel bars, his three
main events. After supplying most
of his own advice for two years, the
Port Saint Lucie, Fla., native applies
constructive criticism with light-
ning speed.
The one lingering question about
Caesar was whether he could show
the same promise in competition.
In the Maize and Blue Intrasquad,
he was in the top three for the Blue
team on all three of his events. If the
meet had been scored like a regular-
season competition, with the top
four overall scores counting, all of 4
Caesar's marks would have contrib-
uted to the team total.
Caesar's - performance only
strengthened his quiet confidence.
"I feel the way I've been training
in the gym and the way (assistant
coach) Scott (Vetere's been pushing
me, I can be reliable," Caesar said
after the meet.
"I want to be the person that
everyone can count on to hit that set
and not mess up when it counts."

LaP lante begins new era

By ROGER SAUERHAFT
Daily Sports Writer
YPSILANTI - Fred LaPlante's
Michigan head coaching career
started this weekend with a trip
across town to face off against his
alma mater for the Eastern Michi-
gan Invitational.
LaPlante, who served as associ-
ate head coach for 11 years, traded
roles with nine-year head coach
Ron Warhurst in September.
LaPlante used his team's perfor-
mance at the non-scoring meet as a
warmup for next Saturday's home
opener, "The Dual" against rival
Ohio State.
One of LaPlante's main objec-
tives for the invitational was to
"shake the cobwebs out," but after
the Wolverines won just two of 35
events, he had mixed feelings about
their success.
"(The story of the meet was)
how close we were to winning
some events but not winning any,"
LaPlante said just before the team's
two victories. "It shows we are
competing, but next we have to get
over the hump. Certainly, nobody
can walk away resting on their lau-
rels. There's work to be done."
Redshirt junior Tony Nalli fin-
ished first in the 3,000-meter run
with a time of 8:24:87, seven sec-
onds ahead of his nearest competi-
tion.
Michigan took the next event,
the 4x400-meter relay, in 3:19:96
thanks to the efforts of junior Matt
Wheeler, sophomore Carl Bucha-
non, sophomore David St. Amant

and fifth-year senior Dan Harm-
sen.
LaPlante noted the two pleasant
surprises from the meet were in the
outcomes of the 60-meter hurdles
and weight-throwing events. The
Wolverines finished second and
third in both events.
Sophomore Troy Woolfolk, a
cornerback on the football team,
also caught the eye of his coach.
In the finals of the 60-meter dash,
Woolfolk dropped four-tenths of
a second off his qualifying-round
time. The finish left him just three-
hundredths of a second out of first
place with a time of 6.86. Fellow
sophomore Robert Peddlar fin-
ished third, just .03 seconds behind
Woolfolk.
"I honestly owe this to football
because Mike Barwis has such a
good program," Woolfolk said of
his improvement from last season.
"He teaches us more explosion, so
coming off the blocks, I feel more
comfortable with my top speed."
He added that he calls his father,
Butch, a former All-American tail-
back and Michigan track star after
each meet, to tell him of his prog-
ress. The younger Woolfolk says
his goal is to break his father's 200-
meter school record, but for the
moment, he has his sights set on
next Saturday's meet against Ohio
State.
"I'm real anxious about it,"
Woolfolk said. "Since they beat us
(in football), this is my chance to
make it even, even the score. So I'm
going to bring something extra for
that."

SWolverines fall
in national duals

Highly ranked
opponents no match
for Wolverines
By RYAN A. PODGES
Daily Sports Writer
In its 87-year history, the Michi-
gan men's swimming and diving
team has never faced Tennessee in
a dual meet.
And judging from the Wolver-
ines' 200-98 victory in their first-
ever meeting Saturday, it might
be a while before the teams swim
against each other again.
No. 4 Michigan expected better
competition from the sixth-ranked
Volunteers, but a Wolverine vic-
tory was never in question. Michi-
gan began the meet by winning five
of the first six events, including a
sweep of the top four places in both
the 200-yard freestyle and butter-
fly. By the end of the meet, Michi-
gan's strong start was too much for
Tennessee to overcome, and as the
Volunteers failed to win a single
swimming event.
"We started off with great swims
and that gave us an early advan-
tage," Michigan coach Mike Bottom
said. "Once we started to roll, they
just didn't respond. And that hap-
pens sometimes when you come in
with high expectations and you get
upset early."
The meet was held at the Counsil-
man-Billingsley Aquatics Center in
Bloomington where the Wolverines
also won their dual meet against No.
14 Indiana, 176-104. This was the
second meeting between the teams
this season and Michigan's second
victory against the Hoosiers. The
Wolverines defeated Indiana 227-151
on Nov. 1.
Michigan's decision to wear faster
swimsuits at the meet undoubtedly
impacted the final score. The new
suits are typically used for champi-
onshipmeets attheendoftheseason,
but Bottom said the coaches chose to
have the team wear the suits at this
meet to see what kind of technique
changes are necessary before wear-

No.17 Michigan
disappointing against
top-15 teams
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
The Sweet 16 was nothing but
sour for the Michigan wrestling
team.
The 17th-ranked Wolverines
participated in at the NWCA/
Cliff Keen National Duals this
weekend. The Duals take 16 of the
nation's top teams and pit them
against each other in a tourna-
ment bracket.
But Michigan was relegated to
the consolation bracket early in
the competition after a 23-9 loss
to third-ranked Cornell in the
first round.
"We've got to be more aggres-
sive," Michigan coach Joe
McFarland said. "That's one
thing I think we need to make a
big improvement on. We're not
getting our shots off, and we're
not going out there with the
intent on scoring right away in
some of our matches, and often
times, that can be the differ-
ence."
The Wolverines tried to make
the best of their drop to the con-
solation bracket with a convinc-
ing 29-10 win over host No. 21
Northern Iowa. But two hours
later, their hopes of a comeback
were dashed in a loss to Big Ten
rival No. 14 Penn State. It was
disappointing end for Michigan
after finishing third at last year's
tournament.
The Wolverines trailed Penn
State by as many as 12 points
but stormed back to tie it at 18
heading into the final bout. An
unnecessary roughness penalty
in the closing minutes sealed
Michigan's fate and the Wolver-
ines left the tournament without
placing.
"We probably should have
won that (last) match," sopho-

more Kellen Russell said. "I
think when we wrestle them in
the Big Ten season, we'll be a lot
more confident than we were
maybe going into that match."
Ranked fourth nationally in
his weight class, Russell was one
of the few bright spots for the
Wolverines. Along with senior
Steve Luke, Russell led the team
with a 3-0 record. Russell also
extended his overall win streak
to nine.
"The matches I lost (this sea-
son) I shouldn't have lost," Rus-
sell said. "So I think my win
streak should be longer than
that. I think it is just about being
mentally prepared for all of our
matches, just going out and get-
ting the first takedown."
The High Bridge, N.J., native's
wins came in three close match-
es. His widest margin of victory
was just three points.
Against Penn State's Frank
Molinaro, Russell almost saw his
win streak stop at eight. After
an uneventful seven minutes,
the match extended into over-
time. Russell scored the pivotal
takedown with just 12 seconds
remaining on the clock.
"I knew it was going to come
down to a takedown," Russell
said. "I knew if I got in on his
legs, I was going tobe able to take
him down. I was able to dive in on
a shot and grab one of his legs and
bully him over to get the kill."
After losing two of the most
decorated wrestlers in program
history in Eric Tannenbaum and
Josh Churella, this year's ver-
sion of the team has shown some
flashes but has come up just short
a number of times.
"We just don't have the same
team as we did last year," McFar-
land said. "We had opportunities
to win that last dual. We lost two
one-point matches. We lost an
overtime match. We beat Penn
State and we're in reach of third
place. As disappointing as it was,
we were right there at the same
time."

ing the suits again at the Big Ten
Championships in February.
Senior co-captain Matt Patton
won both the 1,000-yard freestyle
and the 500-yard freestyle (4:22.14)
Saturday. His time of4:12.80 on Dec.
4th is currentlythe country's fastest
collegiate 500-yard freestyle time
this season. Sophomore Tyler Clary
also had a pair of individual wins in
the 200-yard backstroke and indi-
vidual medley events.
Michigan showed significant
improvement in the breaststroke,
one of the Wolverines' weak strokes.
One of the more exciting races was
sophomore Jared Miller's second-
place finish second in the 200-yard
breaststroke (1:59.77). Miller lost to
Indiana's Heath Tameris by just 0.42
seconds, and Bottom said swimming
under two minutes was a "big step"
for Miller as a breaststroker.

The meet came just one week
after Michigan competed in the
Orange Bowl Classic in Key Largo,
Fla. where the Wolverines held
a training camp. Freshman Dan
Madwed, who won the 200-yard
butterfly Saturday, pointed to the
time the team spent together train-
ing in Florida as a key to helping
everyone come together as a team.
"We really bonded a lot on our
trip and instead of 29 individual
guys we became one united team,"
he said. "Mike (Bottom) really
understands the value of team
chemistry and I think we're begin-
ning to understand how powerful
that can be when we get behind
each other."
Junior Alon Mandel, who won
the 100-yard backstroke said the
team has become more confident
together and with first-year coach-

es Bottom and Josh White.
"We all really supported each
other throughout the meet," he
said. "When we swam Indiana the
first time, we had just met Mike
(Bottom) a few weeks earlier, but
now we know him a lot better and
our confidence has grown, as well
as our physical abilities in the
water."
Bottom has also noticed a differ-
ence as well. With the help of the
captains, he said the team is in the
right mindset and is now more sure
of itself.
"I think they're gaining an
understanding of who they are,
which is what we talked about at
the end of the meet," Bottom said.
"These guys are looking in the mir-
ror and see that they are getting
better and are capable of compet-
ing at a high level."

Resurgent defense
sparks Blue victory

Senior Melinda Queen tied for a team-high 12 points and pulled down seven rebounds in a 58-54 loss to Wisconsin on Sunday.
Road woes continue as
'M' comeback falls short

By ALEX PROSPERI
Daily Sports Writer
A 7:45 a.m. wake-up call threw
a curveball to the Michigan men's
basketball team. But maybe that's
just what the Wolverines'struggling
defense needed.
Against Iowa on Sunday, Michi-
gan surrendered
just 49 points and NOTEBOOK
collected aseason-
high 12 steals in a game that started
at 11:30 a.m.
In the Wolverines' three prior
games, their defense struggled early.
In the first half, Wisconsin shot 65
percent on Dec. 3t, tllinois shot S9
percent on Jan. 4 and tndiana shot
50 percent on Jan. 7.
But it was a completely different
story against town.
The Hawkeyes, third in the Big
Ten in field-goal percentage, made
just a half-dozen shots in the first
half against Michigan's tenacious
1-3-1 zone defense.
"Just come out and jump on them
from the start," said sophomore for-
ward Manny Harris, who matched
his career-high with four steals, of
Michigan's game plan.
Michigan coach John Beilein left
the game pleased with what he saw
defensively.
"I am really proud of the way we
defended tonight and defended well
enough that we could actually get
into some transition baskets," Beil-
ein said.
WELCOME BACK: Michigan's
1974 Big Ten Championship team
was honored at halftime of Sunday's
game.
The team, led by All-American
Campy Russell and coached by Big
Ten Coach of the Year Johnny Orr,
tied Indiana for the conference title.
At the time, only the conference
champion went to the NCAA Tour-
nament, so the two teams played a
one-game playoff in Champaign.
Michigan won the game and went

Michigan coach John Beilein led Michigan to a 64-49 win over Iowa on Sunday. His

It was the sixth time it hap-
pened this season.
Once again, the Wolverines
were on the road. Once again,
there seemed to bea lid on the rim.
And once again, they walked out of
the unfamiliar stadium the losers,
this time to Wisconsin falling to
Wisconsin 58-54.
But this game added a little
wrinkle to the Michigan road rou-
tine. After being down by as much
as 18 in the second half, the Wol-
verines went on a spectacular run,
and cut the large Wisconsin lead to
just three. The comeback signaled
that the team may be developing
some toughness away from home.
Wisconsin, statistically the
best defensive team in the Big
Ten, held Michigan without a
field goal for over eight minutes
until junior center Krista Phillips
knocked down a midrange jumper.
The Wolverines didn't break into
double digits until there were less
than six minutes left in the first
half. And the Badgers held Michi-
gan to a 24-percent shooting clip
in the first half, about 10 percent
worse than the Wolverines' road
average.
"We didn't have any rhythm
at all in the first half," Michigan

coach Kevin Borseth said. "We
just couldn't buy a basket."
But Michigan trailed by just
eight at halftime because it flexed
its own muscle on the defensive
side of the ball, allowing just 26
Wisconsin points in the first half.
Trailing by just eight at halftime
after the way the Wolverines
played was a small miracle.
The Wolverines slowly started
to slip in the second half. The Wis-
consin lead slowly ballooned to 13,
16, 18.
It was at the seven-minute mark
when Michigan began to slow the
Badgers. Down 51-35, senior for-
ward Carly Benson hit a layup.
Senior guard Jessica Minnfield
hit two free throws, and senior
forward Stephany Skrba hit a
jump shot. After a three-pointer
by senior forward Melinda Queen,
Michigan was down by nine and
rolling toward a comeback.
Withlittle to no post presencein
the first half, Borseth credited the
abrupt turnaround to getting shot
opportunities near the basket.
"We kept getting to the rim,"
he said. "They would foul us or we
would convert, but we were get-
ting to the basket."
After a deflating Wisconsin
three-pointer, Michigan con-
tinued its meteoric climb up the
scoreboard, and cut the Wisconsin

lead to three with a minute to go
on arunner in the lane, courtesy of
freshman guard Courtney Boylan.
Down four with 12 seconds left,
a layup from Minnfield rattled out
to end the game.
The second half saw Michigan
drastically improve its shooting to
39 percent, but it wasn't enough.
"Sometimes we passed on shots
we should have taken and we took
shots we shouldn't have taken,"
Borseth said. "We need to learn
from that."
Sophomore guard Veronica
Hicks did her best to help Michi-
gan out, even showing some swag-
ger as she put a finger to her lips
after nailing a three-pointer in the
second half.
Hicks, who has gradually
become a regular among the
team's scoring leaders, ended the
night tied with Queen for the team
lead in points (12).
But the question remains: why
can't Michigan play the way on the
road it does at home, where it has
won six of seven games? Until the
Wolverines find the answer, their
road woes are likely to continue.
Borseth said the game was far
from a complete disappointment.
"We stuck together when it
looked really dismal," he said.
"You don't want to quit. And we
kept playing."

points and 18 rebounds.
According to Russell, this year's
team looks familiar.
"I think this team is kind of remi-
niscent ofa team that we had. When
you look at it and you say, 'Who are
those guys?"' Russell said. "But once
you start playing, once you see how
hard they're playing and how will-
ing they are to sacrifice for each
other, that says to me that you got a
good team."
After the game, two members of
the 1974 squad talked with Beilein
about the game and complimented
his team's effort.
Specifically, Beilein used the 1974
team to describe the hustle of fifth-
year senior C.J. Lee.
"You know Steve Grote would
have done that with Campy (Russell),
C.J. (Kupec) and all those guys, they
would have done those same things,"
Beilein said. "It is just huge."
FRESH START:In the three-game
stretch with Wisconsin, Illinois and
Indiana, Harris was a combined
13-for-40 from the field and was
held below his season scoring aver-
age (18.6) in each game. It was his
worst stretch of the season.

Harris scored 18 points Sunday,
but it was his 6-for-12 shooting that
shows he's back on the right track.
It was the first time he hit half his
shots since Dec. 20 against Eastern
Michigan.
"It feels good every game out,"
Harris said. "But some games you
just don't have your best game.
Today, I did a little bit better than I
usually do."
A FAN OF BEILEIN: Iowa guard
Devan Bawinkel can't say enough
about Michigan coach John Beilein.
Bawinkel appeared in 20 games
under Beilein at West Virginia and
averaged less than two points per
game.
He was recruited by Beilein out
of Winnebago High School in Illi-
nois and was drawn to Beilein's
unique offense, winning tradition
and character.
But when Beilein took the Michi-
gan job after the 2007 season,
Bawinkel decided to leave West Vir-
ginia.
The junior tried to transfer to
Michigan, but it didn't work out due
to scholarship numbers and Bawin-
kel ended up at Iowa.

HAWKEYES
From page 1B
and a large cast on his right foot.
Without Tate, the Hawkeyes were
severely limited on offense.
"Let's not lose sight of the fact
that Cyrus Tate is a huge player in
the Iowa program," Beilein said.
"To get them with two days of prep
time (to come up with a game plan
without Tate), it is a very difficult
thing to coach and to adjust to. We
don't get up and get that lead that

we did when Cyrus is in. He's a
heck of a player."
Tate, who has more than 100
points this season, has almost 40
more rebounds than anyone else
on the roster and leads the team in
blocked shots.
Although Michigan's defense
looked much improved, Harris
stole the show.
After a dismal 4-of-12 shoot-
ing performance against Indiana,
"Manny Fresh" was an efficient
6-of-12, pouring in 18 points and
helping out on both sides of the

ball with eight rebounds and four
steals.
Even though the game was
against a struggling Iowa team
trying to cope with their Cyrus
Tate-less future, it was a big win
for the Wolverines, especially
with their schedule amping up in
the coming weeks.
"We're sitting right where we
want to be coming into these next
couple games," freshman Zack
Novak said. "We still gotta go get
it done on the road now, but we're
ready for the challenge."

MAROSEVIC
From page 1B
would eventually finish his studies
and graduate from Michigan with
a degree.
"It's great when a coach gets
to see their players earn their
degrees and move into law school,
or find that first job as an engineer,
or leave school early and begin
their professional career as a soc-
cer player," Burns said. "That was
really Peri's goal and ambition all
along, and he's taking hold of his
dreams."
But Marosevic began taking
hold of his dreams long before he
arrived at Michigan three years
ago.
Marosevic moved away from
Rockford, Ill. at the age of 14 to
live, attend school and train at The
Soccer Academy in, Bradenton,
Fla.
After playing on the Under-14
soccer team for a year when he
was 13, officials asked him to move
to the training home of the US
Under-17 National Soccer Team
to pursue his professional soccer
aspirations more seriously.
At The Soccer Academy, Maro-
sevic flourished under a rigorous
soccer and academic schedule.
He graduated high school in three
years as the valedictorian at the
age of 17. Following graduation,
he had multiple scholarship offers
but chose to move north to Michi-
gan to play for Burns.
"(Burns) will tell you every-
thing straight up," Marosevic said.
"He's not going to keep anything
hidden behind closed doors. I
wanted a coach that wasn't going
to hold anything back, that was
going to tell me the truth no mat-
ter what happens. I got that from
Burns - from my first impression,
he was exactly who I wanted to be
coached by."
In his freshman year, Maros-
evic forward led the Wolverines
in goals scored and points, the first
time in program history a fresh-
man accomplished the feat. Over

the next two years, he continued
his streak of leading Michigan in
scoring, while racking up honors
including the NSCAA/Adidas All-
Great Lakes Region first team,
All-Big Ten first team, Academic
All-Big Ten Conference and U-M
Athletic Academic Achievement
awards.
A week after receiving the Gen-
eration adidas contract, Marosevic
traveled to Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., to
play in the MLS Player Combine.
The combine divides 70 top
MLS prospects into four teams.
Over five days, the four teams
practice and compete against one
another, offering MLS coaches
and managers a final chance to
evaluate the top talents for Thurs-
day's MLS draft.
Less than four hours from
where he spent his high school
years, Marosevic wasted no time
proving himself worthy of the
MLS, scoring during the first
match of the combine.
As Michigan soccer looks for-
ward to a Marosevic-less offense,
Burns knows there will be more
opportunities for a few of his play-
ers as he calls on them to be more
of an offensive presence. Burns
explained that having Marosevic
on the field provided other players
with the confidence to take chanc-
es, because they know Marosevic
would control the middle of the
field.
"Aside from his play on the
field, what I'll miss more than any-
thing is Peri's personality," Burns
said. "He's a guy that makes our
job as coaches fun, and he has a
great sense of humor and a great
approach to life."
While Marosevic waits to find
out which MLS team he will end
up with, he couldn't be happier
with how his dreams have become
a reality. Few 19-year-olds can say
they've accomplished their life
goal.
"Professional soccer was always
mydream fromwhenI firststarted
playing at age three to now," Maro-
sevic said. "And now, being able to
be living that, it feels great."

It was just that kind of weekend.
"We buried our chances when
we had the opportunity," junior
captain Chris Summers said. "We
just got a little bit of puck luck."
The Wolverines jumped out to a
3-0 lead in the first five minutes of
Saturday's game to set the tone for
the entire series. Michigan never
trailed this weekend, and the Yost
crowd made sure the RedHawks
knew it. Fans shook the building
with each goal of the early scoring
onslaught.
"It's everything," Berenson said
of the early lead. "It gets the crowd
in the game, number one. That's

team that confidence that it needs
so much at home."

ines took the lead in the contest's
first five minutes and never looked

by players and coaches.
Not just because of major impli-
cations in the CCHA standings.
Not just because the Wolverines
wanted to exact revenge on the
only team that dealt them a week-
end sweep.
With a series against confer-
ence top dog Notre Dame looming
in three weeks, Michigan (9-5-0
CCHA, 15-7-0 overall) needed to
make a statement.
And it achieved its goal thanksto
a smothering defense that blocked
25 shots in Sunday's game alone,
solid goaltending from sophomore
Bryan Hogan and, most of all, a
balanced offensive attack.
Since the last series against
Miami six weeks ago, the 10th-
ranked Wolverines have won seven
of eight games. They have scored
36 goals in that stretch, a long cry
from their one-goal weekend in
Oxford.
"Some teams are second-half
teams," Summers said. "Hopefully,
we can be one of those teams."
