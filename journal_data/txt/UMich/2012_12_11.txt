aired their grievances over the

ment's decision to cancel the
Big Heart Big House run at
Monday's meeting of the Senate
Advisory Committee on Uni-

SACUA chair Kimberlee
Kearfott, an engineering pro-
fessor, said at the meeting that
she met with University Ath-
letic Director David Brandon on
Monday morning to discuss the
decision. Kearfott said Bran-
don told her the cancellation of
the race was based on concerns
about the race's sponsor, Chamin
pions for Charity, and did not
reflect broader policy changes.
"The change was not made
for financial reasons because
they did receive fees for use of
the stadium," Kearfott said.

Michigan GOP
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK-
Daily StaffReporter
Redford, Mich. - With thou-
sands of protesters expected
to descend on the State Capitol
on Tuesday, President Barack

Obama entered into the fray
surrounding Michigan's conten-
tious battle over right-to-work
legislation during remarks at
the Detroit Diesel Plant here on
Monday.
Obama, speaking before sev-
eral hundred UAW workers as
well as many members of the
Michigan Democratic Congres-
sional delegation, chastised
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder
and other Michigan Republi-
cans for championingthe recent
right-to-work bills. If signed by

Snyder - which is expected to
occur on Tuesday - the legisla-
tion would make union due pay-,
ments voluntary for private and,
most public-sector unions.
"What we shouldn't be doing
is trying to take away your
rights to bargain for better
wages," Obama said to enthusi-
astic applause. "These so called
right-to-work laws have nothing
to do with economics, they have
everything to do with politics."
Obama pointed to Michigan's
automotive unions as repre-

sentative of the importance of
collective bargaining in the for-
mation of the middle class and
the success of the larger United
States, and he said state and
national representatives should
be fighting to preserve the pro-
cess.
"What they're really talking
about is giving you the right to
work for less money," the presi-
dent said. "America's not going
to compete based on low-skill,
low-wage, no worker's rights -

FINISHING ON A HIGH NOTE

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Even after votes,
students divided
over RSG secession

Both sides argue
over financial
impact of move
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
As results from the ref-
erenda on graduate student
secession from the Central
Student Government roll in,
supporters and detractors of
the issue continue to argue
their respective cases.
Last month, 9.5 percent of
Rackham students voted in
the Rackham Student Gov-
ernment elections with 69
percent of voters supporting
secession. The Law School
Student Senate held its elec-
tions last week with mixed
results for secession. LSSS
election director Joe Gallagh-
er said though turnout in the
school of only 1,165 students
was 48 percent, the margin
of students supporting seces-

sion was narrower fitn the
RSG election, with64 percent,
or 354 voters, in favorand 36
percent, or 203voters, against.
Standing on opposing sides
of the secession argument,
Rackham student Michael
Benson, RSG president, and
Public Policy graduate student
Zeid El-Kilani, the chair of the
CSG Graduate Student Affairs
Commission disagree on the
central reasoning for seces-
sion.
"It's an issue that's com-
pletely about money," El-
Kilani said. "And if anyone
says 'well no it's about repre-
senting these interests more,'
no it has to do with Rackham
- they do great things, they
want to have more money to
do greatthings."
Benson said he wholeheart-
edly rejects that claim.
"What we're looking to
do is not a financial thing at
all - there's a financial com-
ponent," Benson said. "We're

SECESSION
From Page 1
"What we're looking to do
is not a financial thing at all -
there's a financial component,"
Benson said. "We're looking to
increase graduate student ... voice
on campus and campus matters."
Despite the disagreement, the
two parties agree on one thing -
they want to increase funding for
school and college student gov-
ernments.
"We like what (school specific
student governments) do, they do
great things in representing the
students of their home school,"
he said. "They're justified in being
angry that their fee has been stag-
nant."
El-Kilani said he plans to reach
out to each student government
and ask them if they are interest-
ed in raising the student fee and
to see if raising student fee is bet-
ter than secession, an avenue he
plans to pursue if he gets the sup-
port of students and their respec-
tive student governments.
However, El-Kilani said he
can't make any promises about
raising the student fee.
CSG, under its former name
of the Michigan Student Assem-
bly, passed a resolution in 2010 to
increase funding for school and
college governments, but the Uni-
versity administration rejected
the proposal, El-Kilani said.
CSG collects $7.19 from stu-
dents with $1 of the fee going
to the childcare fund. Each stu-
dent also pays $1.50 to his or her
respective school's student gov-
ernment.
El-Kilani added a proposal
to raise the student fee by any
amount could easily be reject-

ed by the University's Board of
Regents - especially considering
that other groups, such as Build-
ing a Better Michigan, that are
interested in increasing the stu-
dent fee.
El-Kilani said he wouldn't sup-
port reappropriating CSG money
to individual student govern-
ments.
"I think the core issue is
money," He said. "That's clearly
what it's all about - to do more
of the things they do, more of the
great things that they do. Obvi-
ously CSG likes havingthe money
to help students as well in a more
centralized manner. So how do
you balance that out?"
Though Benson said additional
funding would be nice, he said it
wouldn't address the need for a
strong, unified voice for gradu-
ate students and said "throwing a
dollar at us" won't keep RSG from
pursuing secession.
"I don't feel comfortable say-
ing, 'We'll trade; if you give us a
dollar, we'll stop doing what we're
doing,"' he said. "The key factor is
the representation, the voice on
campus."
He added that in the prelimi-
nary plan developed by RSG, the
total student fee for graduate
students would actually decrease
from $8.69 to a flat $8.
Benson emphasized the vast
differences between the graduate
student experience and under-
graduate experience to explain
the importance of separate repre-
sentation. He said the age gap, as
well as the increased likelihood
of graduate students having chil-
dren, are just two ways the groups
differ.
Benson also noted that CSG
spent a significant amount of time
on Medical Amnesty, an issue

graduate students have virtually
no interest in, Benson said.
Nevertheless, Benson said he
would like to see open communi-
cation and collaboration between
RSG and CSG.
While discussion over seces-
sion has been heating up over the
past few months, the idea itself
isn't new -graduate students first
attempted secession 38 years ago.
In 1974 graduate student seces-
sion was considered and again in
1997 and in both cases constitu-
tions for the all-graduate student
governments were drafted.
A 1997 letter from RSG execu-
tive board members to the Vice
President for Student Affairs cited
overwhelming support of student
voters from the Law School, the
Medical School, the Rackham
Graduate School and the School
of Social Work.
"In Referenda (sic) conducted
by each student government in
their respective schools, an aver-
age of 95% of graduate student
voters supported the proposed
change," the co-presidents of RSG
wrote.
Though it's.unclear how many
students voted, secession failed
despite the high percentage of
support, though Benson said the
results the results of the Rackham
vote important.
"Is 69 percent of the 10 percent
meaningful? Yes," Benson said,
adding that "one int10 students in
the graduate school voted - that's
pretty pathetic."
El-Kilani disagreed.
"It's always going to be a
slightly skewed sample," he said.
"People who are voting in RSG
elections tend to be people who
have friends running for RSG
or particularly are interested in
RSG."

determine their managing editors
through separate, section-specific
elections.
The managing editor is appoint-
ed by the paper's Management
Desk, consisting of the managing
editors of each section, the senior
editors and the editor-in-chief.
Weiner, who previously served
as managing editor and editorial
page editor, said he wants to focus
on improving the paper's online
presence and interaction with
readers.
"We're kind of in the same boat
as pretty much every other news-
paper," Weiner said. "We're work-
ing in a much smaller market, so
we don't have the clout that The
New York Times has in terms of
developing web applications and
things like that. It's important that
we further develop our website
and its interaction with the com-
munity."
Weiner added that social media
is important for improving rela-
tionships and increasing com-
munication between the sections,
noting that he believes everyone
on staff should know each other.
He added he hopes no lawsuits
occur during his year as editor in
chief, an issue the Daily has occa-
sionally dealt with in the past.
"I think the best legacy an
editor-in-chief can leave is no big
legal problems, and putting the
paper closer to the 21st century,"
Weiner said.
LSA junior Melanie Kruvelis
will join current editorial page
editor, Adrienne Roberts, an LSA
junior, as co-EPE for the paper's
opinion section. Kruvelis said she
and Roberts hope to enhance the
opinion section's online presence
to provide more mediums for peo-
ple to discuss important issues.
She added that the co-EPEs
hope to diversify the content in the
opinion section to relate better to
the University.
"I really hope that we're putting
out content that's really challeng-
ing students to think about what's
going on around them, both local-
ly and nationally, in ways they
haven't expected," Kruvelis said.

Roberts agreed with Kruvelis,
and added that she wants to con-
tinue to attract editorial board
members from across campus to
ensure that each editorial is well-
rounded.
LSA junior Matt Slovin will
serve as managing editor after
working for a year as a senior
sports editor. He said he is excited
to develop a broader view of the

He said he is willing to work
with Republicans in Congress on
a plan to reduce the deficit, but is
not willing to forfeit investments
in education, infrastructure
improvements, or research and
development.
"Our success as a country in
this century will be defined by
how well we educate our kids,
how well we train our workers,
how well we invent, how well
we innovate," he said. "That's
how you bring good jobs back to
Detroit."
After the speech, State Rep.
Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) said

the president's remarks about
unions and the right-to-work leg-
islation was "on-point." She said
the actions taken - or not taken
- by her Republican colleagues in
the Legislature to pass the laws so
quickly seemed undemocratic.
"It's absolutely destructive,"
Tlaib said of the legislation. "To
think that some of the reasons
that they're using to pass this
through so quickly is absolutely
unbelievable."
Maxine Graff-Goodman, a
resident of Farmington Hills,
Mich., said though she and her
husband are not union members,
they came to show support for
the President and the rest of the
UAW.
"We think that we won the
election, it's time for the Republi-
cans to realize that," Graff-Good-
man said. "If we're going to move
this economy forward, we need to
take steps in the right direction to
do that."


paper outside of sports.
He added that he plans to
improve communication between
the managing editor and the sec-
tions, as well as enhance the web-
site.
"That's the direction journal-
ism is heading, so that's where we
need to focus a lot of our time,"
Slovin said in reference to the
Daily's website "Updating it with
fresh content around the clock
will be very important."
Similarly, many section editors
said they hope to improve the Dai-
ly's online presence in the upcom-
ing year.
Newly elected managing news
editor Adam Rubenfire, an LSA
junior, said he is excited to have a
new digital news editor position
on the staff next year, a cause he
championed throughout the past
semester.
"I'm excited that the news sec-
tion will be able to put a bigger
emphasis on social media, blog-
ging and video," Rubenfire said.
He said the news staff plans to
launch a weekly video program
that involves commentary from
Daily reporters on the news from
that week.
"I think this will be great, as
our audience will be able to see
the 'story behind the story,"' he
said. "Our reporters are experts
on their beats, so it's impor-
tant to me that they share their
knowledge with our readers."
Rubenfire added that he also
hopes to work more closely with
the copydesk to'improve commu-
nication between news staff and
copy editors.
Business junior Zach Helfand
and LSA junior Everett Cook,
newly elected co-managing
sports editors, said they plan to
give individual attention and
advice to new writers.
"We're making sure that
everyone gets attention and
every writer, no matter how big
or small the sport, is getting per-
sonalized attention to ensure
that every story and every sport
is going to have quality writing,"
Helfand said.
Cook said he hopes to contin-
ue to improve the section when
he takes over in January.
"I just want to leave the sec-
tion in a better place than where
I found it," Cook said. "It's in a
very good place right now, but
we just have to keep pushing
towards where we're working
for."
Public Policy junior Kayla
Upadhyaya, the newly elected
managing arts editor, said she
also wants to work more with
online content, noting she plans
to revamp the arts website The

Filter. As a senior arts editor
this year, Upadhyaya created an
editorial staff for the blog.
"Rebranding The Filter
and really making it its own
dynamic site, I think will really
improve the arts section overall,
especially as journalism makes
its transition into a more online
base," Upadhyaya said.
LSA junior Terra Molengraff,
co-managing photo editor, said
she too hopes to enhance the
photo staff's presence online by
creating more photo blog posts.
"We're probably going to have
weekly blog posts already inte-
grated into the staff positions so
that way we don't have to expect
people to do them," Molengraff
said.
Her co-editor, LSA junior
Adam Glanzman, said having
two managing photo editors will
allow Molengraff and himself to
spread out their responsibilities
and work better with the staff.
Co-managing design edi-
tor Kristen Cleghorn, an Art &
Design junior who joined the
staff in September, said she
hopes to use her design experi-
ence to improve the layout of the
news section.
"We're planning on having
more infographics and to coor-
dinate a little more with news
and bring a more visual aspect
to that," Cleghorn said, adding
that she's toying with different
layout possibilities for the front
page.
Cleghorn will work with co-
managing design editor Nick
Cruz, an LSA freshman.
LSA junior Haley Goldberg,
the newly elected magazine
editor, said The Statement will
include more reader perspective
by dedicating the first few pages
of each issue to popular topics
across campus.
"We hope to talk about things
that are trending on campus,
whether that be current events,
memes or images, and just using
The Statement in those first
couple pages to cultivate what
people are talking about on
campus," Goldberg said.
She added she hopes to con-
tinue to use feature stories to
shine light on important nation-
al topics that affect campus.
Future co-copy chiefs Jose-
phine Adams, an LSA junior,
and Tom McBrien, an LSA soph-
omore, said they will split shifts
up for their staff so style will be
edited by one person, and fact-
checked by another.
"We feel people will be more
thorough in their fact-checking
if they're role is limited to a spe-
cific task," Adams said.

or not the University will pur-
chase the Blimpy Burger facility,
including the 2,776-square-foot
apartment and 950-square-foot
restaurant located on 549 and 551
S. Division St., respectively.
The purchase would cost$l.075
million, and according to a com-
munication signed by Timothy
Slottow, the University's execu-
tive vice president and chief finan-
cial officer, the current property's
managers would maintain control
until August 31, 2013 when their
leases expire.
In a separate communication,
Slottow also requested that the
regents consider the purchase
of nearby 0.09-acre property at
545 S. Division St. for $425,000.
The current residents of the
2,434-square-foot apartments
would be allowed to complete
their leases contracted through
August 31, 2013.
Blimpy Burger employee Kevin
Gorine said in an interview with
The Michigan Daily last week that
he hopes the restaurant, which
has been at its present location for
more than 60 years, will relocate
close to Central Campus.
"It's not a fun thing for anyone,
when you have an icon in one loca-
tion for so long," Gorine said. "But
I (need) to look at the positive side
of it and hope that we can do in a
different spot."
Rich Magner, the owner of
Blimpy Burger, said he hopes loyal
customers will understand that

Brandon told the 1290 WLBY
radio station last week that the
Athletic Department withdrew
from the race because a Univer-
sity-sponsored race could bring
more revenue for charities.
"If we can get more money
routed to the charities because
there isn't a profit motive, we're
always going to prefer to'go that
route," he said in an interview
with the station.
Other SACUA members
agreed with Kearfott and Bran-
don that the Athletic Depart-
ment was right to question
Champion for Charity's motives.

"It is a private company
that runs things for charities,"
Engineering Prof. Robert Ziff,
a SACUA member, said at the
meeting. "There might be anoth-
er side to this story we're not
hearing.
Last-week, Andrea Highfield,
owner of Champions for Charity,
told The Michigan Daily that the
business has brought in $3.5 mil-
lion for charity overthe six years
it organized the race. Regis-
trants for the run pay a fee rang-
ing from $32 to $39 and must
pay a $3.25 processing charge to
enter. Portions of the proceeds
goto non-profits such as the CS.
Mott Children's and Von Voigt-
lander Women's Hospital.
Champions for Charity could
not be reached for comment
Monday.
Kearfott called the decision
"well-considered" but said the
University did not do a good job
announcing it.
"The handling of the
announcement could have been
better done," she said.
She said because this was a
single decision and not a poli-
cy change it did not need to be
brought in front of the Advisory
Board on Intercollegiate Athletics,
a committee devoted to providing
advice to the athletic director.

FROM THE DAIUY
n transi
Regional plans should benefit all counties
comprehensive and well-planned transportation system bene-
fits local commuters and increases the efficiency and possibil-
ity of regional transportation. In recent months, policymakers
have worked toward a regional transit system connecting the counties
of Washtenaw, Wayne, Oakland and Macomb. In theory, this propos-
al could benefit all counties. However, in reality it focuses too much
on rebuilding Detroit and catering transportation to commuters at
the expense of other counties. While revitalizing Detroit should be a
priority for the state, state senators must consider the needs of all the
counties so that the proposed Southeast Michigan Regional Transit
Authority would benefit all involved.

NTAFLEQUOTABLE
The governor of Michigan is one greedy
nerd and he's one weak geek."
- Incoming Michigan Senate Minority Leader Tim Greimel (D-Auburn Hills)
said about Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder.
Find value in variety

The Michigan legislaturehasbeenworking
on a bill that would create a regional transit
authority in southeastern Michigan with one
representative from each of the four coun-
ties involved. The new proposal does stipu-
late that a unanimous vote would be required
for all funding or rail projects. As a result,
the Ann Arbor Transit Authority would fall
under the jurisdiction of the Regional Tran-
sit Authority. Other counties not included in
the program could petition the authority and
become a participatory member.
Theoretically, the RTA is an innovative and
efficient way to promote inter-county trans-
portation for these four areas. However, it does
not address the needs of Washtenaw County.
Currently, the local government has a strong
transportation system. State Sen. Tom Casper-
son (R-Escanaba) said the "only way to make
this work is it has got to be regional" and there
has "to be buy-in from the whole region, not
just Wayne County or Detroit." The proposed
bill would make Washtenaw County pay for
transportation in the other counties without
improvingthe local system.
By not addressing the needs of each coun-
ty, the proposal might hurt certain areas.
According to State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann

A'rbor), the new legislation would prevent
Washtenaw County from repairing existing
tracks and projects, which may hinder future
transportation endeavors. Irwin added that
the new authority could take away funds
from Ann Arbor's current transportation
system as well as others.
Furthermore, the bill privileges bus trans-
portation over other types of transportation,
such as railways. By only focusing on buses,
Michigan would limit the possibility of future
expansion and would fail to create county-
specific transportation solutions. For example,
cities like Seattle have developed a multi-facet-
ed approach to transportation, which includes
buses, rail projects and ferries. While there
have been debates about the effectiveness of
the plans, Seattle has allowed itself to expand
its infrastructure. Michigan should aim for a
similar system. By requiring unanimous votes
for funding and rail projects, the Michigan
legislature would severely limit the scope and
potential of this proposal.
Anewregionaltransitauthority,inprinciple,
could bring benefits to all counties involved.
Nevertheless, the current plan mustbe revised.
At this juncture, Washtenaw County stands to
gain verylittle fromthis proposal.

There's currently a dispropor-
tionate focus on particular
majors, specifically science,
technology, engi-
neeringand math
concentrations.
From President
Barack Obama to
the U.S. Cham-
ber of Com-
merce, everyone
is talking about
the need to HARSHA
produce more NAHATA
workers with
an expertise in
STEM fields for the United States
to stay competitive.
While there's a need to spur eco-
nomic growth and make American
workforce more globally competitive,
there's an overemphasis on STEM
majors, including sote of the more
drastic measures placing other fields
of study at an unfair disadvantage.
On Dec. 9, Florida Republican Gov.
Rick Scott's task force on higher edu-
cation proposed to keep state univer-
sity tuition rates frozen for majors
in "strategic areas." In other words,
students pursuing degrees in engi-
neering or biotechnology would pay
less than students pursuing degrees
in history or psychology. Scott also
suggested that the 28 community
colleges in Florida offer certain four-
year degrees for $10,000 - $3,000
cheaper than normal. Again, this
discount would apply for degrees
only in certain fields.
Scott argues that doing so works
to satisfy market demand, consid-
ering the shortage that companies
claim exists in STEM professions.
But in the drive to overcome a so-
cslled shortage in one area, we're
downplaying the importance of
other fields, namely the humanities
and social sciences.
Being a social science major
myself, I feel the need to reiterate
the classic pitch for the humanities
and social sciences. While science

and math provide tangible results
that can be evaluated, the humani-
ties provide a way to understand the
intangibles - a way to understand
the history, culture and ideas of soci-
ety. Yes, you need people inventing
and calculating and programming,
but that also needs to be coupled
with a knowledge of where society
is, where it's going and where it has
come from. Many argue that human-
ities are vital for the construction
of successful societies and commu-
nities because they force people to
critically analyze the philosophies
and ideas that cultures, societies and
communities are built around.
A study in the United Kingdom
found that 60 percent of Britain's
leaders have degrees in the humani-
ties, arts or social sciences. Only 15
percent have degrees in STEM sub-
jects. These leaders include FTSE 100
CEOs, a group of leading UK firms,
members of Parliament, vice chancel-
lors of universities and lawyers.
Perhaps this comes as a surprise.
But the fact is that the liberal arts
are instrumental in teaching criti-
cal thinking and analysis. And in a
way, while the subject matter may
not translate as tangibly as knowl-
edge gained in a biology or chemis-
try class, the skills taught in terms
of analysis are invaluable.
This inclination to favor STEM
majors touches upon the age-old
dichotomy between science and
math vs. humanities and social sci-
ences. But that's exactly the prob-
lem. There doesn't need to be such
a wide divide between the fields.
Most areas of study are intercon-
nected and add or detract from each
other. By favoring one over another,
it's only creating even more of a
separation between the subjects,
falsely giving the idea that they
are two separate entities not to be
intertwined or combined.
The mostvaluable education is an
interdisciplinary one. Believe it or
not, there are things that engineers

or math majors can learn from his-
tory, English or the arts. And simi-
larly, there are essential skills that
students in the humanities can gain
from science or math classes. The
best education is a holistic one, one
that allows you to see the subject
you're studying from a variety of
different lenses.
Not only that, but the inherent
Tuition freezes
for STEM
majors are
short-sighted.
problem with such a policy is that
it nudges students toward STEM
majors whose talents and passion
may lie elsewhere. By pandering
solely to where the jobs are, we
might be squelching people's inner
brilliance in avariety of other fields.
In this situation, I'm reminded of
a quote by Howard Thurman: "Don't
ask what the world needs. Ask what
makes you come alive, and go do it.
Because what the world needs is peo-
ple who have come alive."
In the end, that's what will make
for successful economic growth.
People doing what they love, what
they feel passionately about, what
makes them come alive - whether
that's physics or math or history or
writing. The key goal of education
shouldn't be to fit people into a nar-
row mold of what makes the perfect
job applicant, but rather to give
them the skills and creativity to
have a broad scale of opportunities.

Deactivating extroversion


Donate digifr6

I just took down my Facebook account. No,
no, don't worry those of you who so religious-
ly check my timeline - as Facebook asked me
when I quit, yes, I'll be back.
And yet, something in me hated checking
that little circle - as much as I was comforted
that Illbe back and that it wasn't a permanent
deletion, I despised myself for it. So what's
the big emotional deal about deactivating an
account during finals? On one hand, it's as if
I've finally succumbed to the professors who
have been trying so hard to get us off Face-
book and phones during class.
On the other, there's a sense of relief in
leaving. I don't have to live up to the expecta-
tion of adding new photos to show people that
I still exist; I don't have to post on a friend's
wall so I can get a response showing that peo-
ple have some minor desire to communicate
with me.
What does it say about me that I'm so con-
scious of something my grandma would sim-
ply call a wise decision? Well, in a society
ruled by extroversion, where social interac-
tion is not only encouraged but also required,
it seems as though I've literally "signed off."
To leave Facebook is to leave your friends, at
least according to the Facebook team, who
was so kind to remind me that Spencer, Ste-
ven, Sophia and Sam would all miss me; it's to
leave your circles - the Facebook team was
generous in recommending I appoint a new
group administrator given I was shirking my
responsibilities; it's to divest from societal
news - the Facebook team made it clear I
would no longer receive notification updates
telling me when I ought to pay attention. It's
to become completely absent - the Facebook
team thought it important I recognize that
people would no longer be able to search for,
nor find me.
Where does introversion fit into all of
this? I'm just trying to take care of my men-
tal health and my sanity during a ridiculously

crazy couple of weeks. Who knew looking out
for oneself could be so profoundly selfish?
Maybe the issue with "work and play" is that
work - as we've experienced it - is inher-
ently introverted. Maybe the reason we can't
stand work is that it's just so damn personal.
During that work, that Sunday to Thursday
week which is so unbearable, we've become
introverts - we've cut ourselves off from the
network. Now it's clear that the reason why
we so frequently "play hard" after we "work
hard" is that we've got so much to catch up on.
There shouldn't be anything about work-
ing that cuts us off from the rest of human-
ity. I think that in a world where work might
actually be play, where we might enjoy the
means and not just the ends, work would be as
social as play. Play is fundamentally social, as
the word itself indicates interaction, so why
should work be separated from that?
So back to finals week and Facebook. I got
emotional about whether or not my account was
still up was because I felt like I was sacrificing
my friends for myself. It's in that context, where
work is individual and play is social, that extro-
version mustbe "deactivated" to focus inwards.
I don't think that's the way it should be. I'm not
sure working at 11:52 p.m: on a Saturday should
be frowned upon, as I'm not sure getting up at
8 a.m.on a Wednesday during Welcome Week
should be, either.
We've created this rule for ourselves that
we must step "in the zone" at work and "zone
out" at play. I'm against the belief that the line
between work and play should be so clearly
defined. I just don't understand the idea that
we can only struggle through work alone, and
that can only enjoy play together, and that's
the way it is. The integration of social engage-
ment and individual focus should be a goal of
ours. Maybe then I wouldn't feel so bad about
quitting Facebook for all of 10 days.

The Salvation
Army's bell rings
outside of grocery stores, malls
and other retail outlets. Anyone
walking up State Street by Nickels
Arcade will hear it as well, accom-
panied as always by a bundled-up
volunteer and a red bucket with a
slit in the top for donations.
If you plan on donating to the
Salvation Army or another charity,
you're not alone. In 2011, 81 percent
of people in the United States made
a charitable donation, and the total
amount of money donated by individ-
uals, foundations and corporations
totaled nearly $300 billion. Many
students at the University share a
desire for making a difference in
the community through charity, but
donating money can be difficult to
justify when students pay for tuition,
rent, food and all the other expens-
es of college life. But thanks to the
Internet, giving to charity is now
so easy that you don't even have to
spend any of your own money.
You can do this by hopping on

YouTube on Dec. 17 and 18 for the
Project For Awesome on Hank and
John's channel. Inaugurated in
2007, the P4A is a yearly event where
thousands of people upload videos
supporting charitable organizations.
Award-winning author John Green
and his. web-entrepreneur brother
Hank run the P4A, and more than
843,000 subscribers to the brothers'
YouTube channel provide a massive.
base for participation. They and all
YouTube visitor's are encouraged to
view, "like" and comment on all of
the videos under the P4A hashtag in
order to promote charitable causes.
On the P4A's website, which goes
live on Dec. 17, the public can vote
for their favorite cause and donate
to the P4A fund. Every dollar in the
fund is split between the five chari-
ties that receive the most votes. The
fund already has $15,000 and anon-
ymous donors have offered to match
contributions up to $50,000.
This campaign is more- modern
than the Salvation Army bell ringer.
The P4A leverages the power of the
world's largest video-sharing com-
munity to make the work of charities
all over the world available for free to
anyone with an Internet connection.
Many of the videos are extremely
well produced, and there's no lack
of charities to pick from. It's an
extremely democratic process, and
doing anything beyond watching the
videos is obviously voluntary. Even
those charities that don't place in the
top five benefit - they gain exposure
to a public that would have been dif-
ficult to otherwise reach. Moreover,

viewers don't have to go through the
P4A in order to donate - many par-
ticipants solicit direct donations to
their charity during their video.
In previous years, people navi-
gating to the main page of YouTube
on the days of the P4A have been
greeted not with trending videos of
erratic cat behavior and pop music
videos, but with videos supporting
the microfinance site Kiva, a Bangla-
deshi orphanage and thousands of
other causes. It acts as a small sug-
gestion for all YouTube users to post-
pone their entertainment or how-to
video for amoment andbe exposed to
organizations that they would have
never come into contact with other-
wise. In this way, the project's impact
is far larger than the amount of cash
doled out to the top five charities.
YouTube videos
for charity.
So take some time out of studying
for finals and watch a few of the P4A
videos on Dec. 17. Throw in a vote
while you're there, and ifa charity
particularly moves you, send a few.
dollars its way. The top five chari-
ties in 2011 each received $14,269,
and the top five this year may get
even more than that. When making
a difference is this easy, why would
anyone pass up the chance?

Michigan welcomes Bearcats

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan basketball
team is a 38-point favorite over
Binghamton in Tuesday night's
game. But that doesn't necessar-
ily equate to an easy week for the
Wolverines.
Aside from
the added C

Beilein echoed BTN
those senti-
ments, calling the scout team
"cagey, son-of-a-guns back
there."
"Our scout team gives us the
best games that we get some-
times," Beilein said.
And that'll likely hold true
this week, when Michigan (9-0)
welcomes the Bearcats to Crisler
Center, where it has lost just
once since the start of last sea-
son. Binghamton (2-8) is riding a
four-game losing skid, including
a 22-point loss to 5-3 Bryant on
Sunday.
The Bearcats have just one
player, freshman Jordan Reed,
who averages in double figures.

Reed is scoring 18.3 points per
game, but has probably never
played in an atmosphere like the
one he'll face inAnn Arbor.
Several blowout wins have
allowed Beilein the flexibil-
ity to reach deep into his bench,
sometimes playing upwards of
12-to-13 players. Weeks like this
and games against foes such as
the Bearcats allow Beilein the
opportunity to continue putting
the piecestogether in his rota-
tion with Big Ten play just a few
weeks away.
"(The rotation is) set, but it's
never really setbecause foul trou-
ble can change the whole rota-
tion, or an injury," Beilein said.
"Generally, you shorten it later on
in the year - I think every coach
does - but nine or 10 would be
good. Nine is always a pretty
good number."
The fight for a spoton the floor
is an everyday battle, and eight
players are scrapping for min-
utes, making practices this year
some of the most intense Beilein
has seen in his 34 years of coach-
ing. He said that onlytwo players,
sophomore guard Trey Burke and
junior guard Tim Hardaway Jr.,
don't necessarily have to prove .
themselves on a daily basis, but
that doesn't hamper their effort
in practice.
"Tim and Trey set the stage
because they know they're not -
their minutes aren't at stake like
other guys' may be at stake, (but)
they're the hardest two com-

petitors we have," Beilein said.
"Everybody knows that we're
watching everything, because
that's how we dole out the min-
utes.
"So when (Tim and Trey) set
that, it's like Zack and Stu all over
again - that set type of demean-
or for every practice. It's easy,
everyone else just follows along."
Redshirt freshman forward
Max Bielfieldt, who sprained
his ankle in practice last week,
is questionable for Tuesday's
game. The forward hasn't played
since registering nine minutes
against Bradley on Dec. 1, but was
expected to practice Monday.
Even with an injured Bielf-
eldt, Beilein has more frontcourt
depth than he's ever had at Mich-
igan. While redshirt forward
junior Jordan Morgan, freshman
forward Mitch McGary, and even
redshirt sophomore Jon Horford
see most of their action as the
only true post presence on the
floor, the sixth-year headman
said he'd like to have two big men
on the floor for about 10 minutes
per game.
And even with a little time
before conference play kicks off
on Jan. 3, Beilein was careful not
to push his players too hard on
Sunday following the 80-67 win
over Arkansas and its '40 minutes
of hell' playing style.
"The exams are here, every-
thing is really tight," he said.
"After the Arkansas game, I
needed a rest, let alone our team."

Despite its recent lack of suc-

Michigan leads the all-time
series 12-8, and plans to add to
that Tuesday. The Wolverines
hope to build off their success
against Illinois State.
"Anytime you win on the
road against a quality opponent
it's a great victory," said Michi-
gan coach Kim Barnes Arico. "I
was really happy with that. We
are ready to move forward and
build off of that."
The victory over the Red-
birds was also Michigan's best
rebounding game this season.
The Wolverines grabbed a
season-high 42 rebounds, and
sophomore forward Nicole
Elmblad had a career-high 10
rebounds. In addition, Michi-
gan's opponents have averaged
32.7 rebounds per game, but the
Wolverines held Illinois State to
only 24 rebounds.
"I think we rebounded excep-
tionally well," Barnes Arico
said. "We (also) limited them to
second-chance points, so we did
a great job there (too)."

issue for the injury-depleted
team. And now that the Wolver-
ines have started finding suc-
cess on the boards, it's time to
focus on turnovers, which con-
tinue to be a problem as Michi-
gan averages 15.1 per game.
"We have to get better at pres-
sure," said senior guard Rachel
Sheffer. "We (also) missed a lot
of layups and turned the ball
over by traveling. (But) all of
this leads to turnovers and (we)
know we have to work on that."
Eastern Michigan will have
to force as many turnovers as
it can to help slow down senior
forward Kate Thompson's hot
hand. Thompson had a game-
high 18 points against Illinois
State, and leads the team in
scoring with 15.7 points per
game.
Senior guard Jenny Ryan will
also make the Eagles' task more
difficult. Ryan averages 12.9
points per game, 5.1 rebounds
per game, and 3.8 assists per
game.
"It (was) big for our season

andbigforour team," Ryan said.
"(That was) a very good Illinois
State team, so it was a key win
for us."
Meanwhile, farther down
Washtenaw Avenue, Eastern
Michigan is coming off a heart-
breaking 66-65 loss to South
Dakota State. The Eagles are
5-4 against the Wolverines on
their home floor, and know they
can turn their season around
with a win.
Eastern Michigan will need
redshirt senior guard Miranda
Tate to continue stepping up.
Tate has scored ateam-high 14.4
points per game, and the Eagles
also have junior forward Olivia
Fouty's 10.7 points per game
and team-high 8.3 rebounds per
game.
Though they've only won
one game this season, Eastern
Michigan has been resilient in
every matchup. Besides a large
23-point loss against Wyoming,
the Eagles average defeats by 6.1
points, showing they are a few
shots away from victory.


'M' to be tested by Texas in Final Four

Wolverines
could have just
as easily been another group of
students studying in the Fish-
bowl during finals week.
Since dropping two of the
their final four matches of the
season against unranked oppo-
nents, the Wolverines have put
together a season-high six-
game win streak at a time when
it mattered most - the postsea-
son.
And while Michigan had
seven consecutive postseason
appearances before this year,
Saturday's victory was the first
Final Four berth in team his-
tory.
"We knew we had the talent
all along," said Michigan coach
Mark Rosen. "It was just a mat-
ter of putting it together."
First, there was Tennessee, a
team that finished second in the
SEC with a 22-8 overall record.
Despite an early 2-0 advantage
for the Wolverines, it took five
sets to put away the resilient
Volunteers and advance.
Next, they faced Louisville.

against unranked Michigan.
But once again, it was an upset
in favor of the underdogs. Once
it was all said and done, the
Wolverines were in the Final
Four.
But up until the postseason,
Michigan hadn't been playing
up to its potential.
Sure, there were signature
Michigan wins against Nebras-
ka and Stanford, career-high
nights for junior outside hit-
ter Molly Toon and sophomore
setter Lexi Dannemiller. There
were also the disappoint-
ing losses to Northwestern
in straight sets and Michigan
State at home.
"We know that the games
that we've lost we could have
played a lot better," said senior
middle blocker Claire McEl-
heny. "Whether we would have
won (those games) or not, I
don't know."
As any University student
will tell you: it's all about the
final.
No. 3 Texas heads back to
Louisville with a 27-4 record
having breezed by Colgate,
Texas A&M, Florida and finally
USCto earn a place in the Final
Four.
Much like the Wolverines,
the Longhorns put together a
strong second half, winning 17
of its last18 matches. But Texas'
four losses this season came
against Penn State, Minnesota,
Illinois - two teams Michigan
defeated.
Michigan also put up abetter
fight against then-No. 1 Penn
State than the Longhorns who
were swept in three sets.
"We definitely feel like we
deserve to be there (in the
championship)," Dannemiller
said before the first round.
Now all the Wolverines have
to do is pass Texas's test.

Senior outside hitter Claire McElheny and the Wolverines are on to Louisville.

Playing on their home court,
the ninth-ranked Cardinals
were a another tough matchup-
for the Wolverines.
But as it had last year - after
upsetting No. 6 Stanford -
Michigan prevailed into the
Sweet 16.
Having bowed out of the

year and, like the regular sea-
son split would have predicted,
anybody's game. This time,
though, three sets were enough
to advance past the Spartans
into the Elite Eight for the sec-

Finally, the second-ranked
Cardinal didn't just have tal-

Game's right 'Piece'

Kendrick Lamar pens
a Compton tragedy

After a lull, The
Game has found
himself
By JACKSON HOWARD
Daily Arts Writer
Since being dropped from Dr.
Dre's Aftermath label, Game has
been suffering from something
best described
as an iden-
tity crisis. His
debut, 2005's Game
The Docu-
mentary, and Jesus Piece
its successor, Inerscope
2006's Doctor's
Advocate, were
hailed almost instantly as land-
mark West Coast albums and
undoubtedly embodied Game's
unique sound.
By 2008, however, Game
seemed to have abandoned his
role as West Coast savior and
instead became, well, nothing.
His mediocre third and fourth
albums were messy, disjointed
compilations with an eye-popping
amount of guests, all of whom
Game attempted to imitate.
Game wasn't Game anymore.
Whatever identity and craft he
had on his first two albums had
disappeared by 20i1. He was
washed up.
Then Jesus Piece arrived. Sud-
denly, it all makes sense. Game
wasn't wasting away over the
last six years. He was just doing
a little soul searching. Jesus Piece
is his long overdue masterpiece.
The Game who made this album
isn't Dr. Dre's protege or a style-
jacking chameleon, but instead
a real, true artist. Call him a late
bloomer, but at 33 years old, Jay-
ceon Taylor has finally found
himself
A total of23 artists, from Jamie
Foxx to Lil Wayne, show up on
Jesus Piece. Somehow, though,
the album flows seamlessly, as
,each guest seems to understand
his place in the grand scheme
of the project. A concept album,
Jesus Piece is connected through
a theme of religion, specifically
Christianity, though it's far from

"Oh, 1 know I'm awesome."
being quoted by your neighbor-
hood pastor in his next sermon.
In "Church," a buoyant strip-
club anthem Trey Songz tells a
woman that she's "thicker than
a Bible." Throughout the album,
Game plays with different defini-
tions of religion, and he's happyto
point out on "Church" the irony
of a good Christian man leav-
ing mass to go eat some chicken
wings and "see some hoes twerk,"
a point that's hilariously empha-
sized by a subsequent skit.
The second track, "Ali Bomaye,"
featuring2 Chainz and Rick Ross,
clocks in a little long at about five
and a half minutes. That being
said, the track is so incredibly epic
that after a few listens, the length
is negligible. Over an apocalypti-
cally raucous and haunting beat,
Game namedrops Will Smith,
Usain Bolt and Kanye West in
the same verse, 2 Chainz claims
he has cologne "that cost more
than your rent" and, best of all,
Ross compares himself to Michael
Phelps while rapping about smok-
ing Hawaiian tree bark and own-
ing rifles with lasers.
The album isn't all adrenaline,
though. "Pray" finds Game trad-
ing bars with J. Cole about strug-
gling women. And on "Can't Get
Right," Game confesses his sins
and admits he was hurt when
former mentor Dr. Dre signed
Kendrick Lamar as his proteg6.

Game has moved on, though, and
it's no accident that Kendrick is
featured on the song right before,
the somber "See No Evil."
Game's albums have always
been wonderfully produced, but
Jesus Piece is even better. The
album incorporates more vocal
samples than any rap release
since The College Dropout, but
while Kanye's debut relied on
one technique - the sped-up soul
sample - Jesus Piece utilizes a
variety of sounds to create a piece
of work that plays completely dif-
ferent than anything out in rap
right now.
"Freedom" uses an early 2000s
Kanye-sounding beat, "Hallelu-
jah" is backed by a church choir
and "All That (Lady)," featuring
a lineup of Lil Wayne, Big Sean,
Fabolous and Jeremih, flips neo-
soul legend D'Angelo's hit "Lady"
into an ode to women that is both
radio-friendly and well-crafted.
"This is my life and it's exactly
how I planned it, damn it" Game
snarls on the standout title track,
which features Kanye and Com-
mon. A debatable statement
undoubtedly, especially coming
from Game, but in the context
of Jesus Piece it makes sense:
He's finally in control. The soul-
searching is over. Just like Jesus,
Game has been resurrected.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the Church of Game.

"I hope the universe loves you
today," he speaks, and the words
pool into a thick foundation of
grief, remorse and concession.
The lines could've appropri-
ately fallen on the lips of many
of literature's classic charac-
ters: Hamlet, contemplating the
nature of destiny, or Romeo peti-
tioning for fortune.
Yet this short soliloquy isn't
inscribed within the dusty tomes
of old theater scripts; it's pressed
within the crisp plastic of Ken-
drick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d
city - a hip-hop tragedy for the
modern age. Woven into the
beats is a visceral tale of pain and
loss, a narrative carved out of the
desolate patch of concrete that is
South Central L.A.
And unfortunately it's easy
to miss - songs like "Backstreet
Freestyle" belie the existence of
anything below the "Damn I got
bitches" surface. But make no
mistake, Kendrick is as much a
playwright as he is lyricist.
I present to you:

Kendrick Lamar is 17, red
blooded, a teenager in every
explicit sense of the term. He's
seduced by a girl - a long con, a
ruse perpetrated through Nextel
conversations in a heat-stroked
summer.
"It's deep rooted, the music of
beingyoung and dumb /It's never
muted, in fact it's much louder
where I'm from."
He's wary, justifiably so -
the girl's cousin Demetrius is
a known gang banger, but as it
is with being young and dumb,
these things pale in the spotlight
of lust. A text (the contemporary

pigeon or messenger), a reply, and
"Passing Alameda, my gas
meter in need of a pump / I got
enough to get me through the
traffic jam."
The bumper-to-bumper scene
is one of most applicable sym-
bols - the tension, the grind,
the front-to-back friction in
shimmering heat. Kendrick
is "enthused by the touch of a
woman," drunk on the moment,
too impaired to think straight.
"I pulled up, a smile on my
face, and then I see / Two niggas,
two black hoodies, I froze as my
phone rang... "
The actual sound is jarring, the
plot climaxing all too soon (Ken-
drick perhaps a bit too enthused),
and we are flung back into the
past of a Compton timeline.

In their dangerous, kinetic
boredom, they happen to rob a
house, a "first offense" for Ken-
drick's record. The song fades
to dark. We learn in the outro
skit that Kendrick plans to go to
a girl's house later - the same
interest from the first track, yet
still in the relationship's fledgling
moments.
Interlude: Breathe Slow
Though the plot is barely
touched upon in "Swimming
Pools (Drank)," the outro skit
gives us the provocation, the act
that will set in motion'Kendrick's
own fate. As the crew's slow-
roasted crime spree stretches to
a botched drive-by shooting, the
rapper's friend Dave is himself
shot and killed.

Epilogue: Compton
The last words here don't
need to be spoken by Kendrick,
but are rather a soliloquy from
his mom, before the events of
track one - a message left on his
phone.
"If I don't hear from you, by
tomorrow .... I hope you come
back, and learn from your mis-
takes. Come back a man, tell
your story to these black and
brown kids in Compton. Let
'em know that you was just like
them, but you still rose from
that dark place of violence... "
Just another day in Compton.

Bruno Mars is exceedingly
talented - no denying that.
And for quite a while, it seemed
as though he
was steering
his artistry in
a delectable Bruno Mars
direction, espe-
cially for 21st Unorthodox
century pop. Jukebox
The "Just the
Way You Are" Atlantic
singer was a
sweetheart who pranced around
making his reggae pop, caus-
ing 14-year-old girls to swoon
worldwide.
But those same tweens will
be asking their mothers what it
means to be "fucking like goril-
las" soon after picking up their
copy of Unorthodox Jukebox.
Doo-Wops & Hooligans wasn't
exactly a G-rated album, but
the hike in explicitness on this
sophomore album is enough
to make you wonder if Mars is
attempting the grotesque edgi-
ness of Kanye West or Tyler, The
Creator.
Originality is in the ear of the
beholder, however, and for those
who have never sampled The
Police, the record's lead single
"Locked Out of Heaven" is a new
sound indeed. Sting aside, the
song is contemporary, danceable
and holds a No. 2 spot on the Hot
100, despite the lack of sexual
artistic subtleties when "the sex
takes (him) to paradise."
"Young Girls" explores Mars's
attraction to the demographic of

ATLANTIC

his debut album - a track that's
short and to the point: "Young
wild girls make a mess" of people
like Bruno Mars. But let's not
ruin the simplicity of the track by
diving into the legality of it all.
Mars channels Michael Jack-
son in the album, but in more
ways than hitting it off with the
adolescent members of society.
"Natalie," the not-so-long lostsis-
ter of "Dirty Diana," is a similarly
caustic tale of a girl who took
things too far. It's a well-played
formula. Shout a name in hatred,
follow up with something they
did and, of course, repeat.
Sure, there's familiarity in the
musical style of the album, but
it's nothing familiar with the 21st
century. Also, the hint of reggae
developed from Mars's own pro-
duction team "The Smeezing-
tons" gives Unorthodox Jukebox
the Bruno Mars sound, and that
holds the foremost importance in
his artistry. For instance, "Show
Me" might be in the same vulgar
pool as the album's other tracks,
but at least the native Hawaiian

artist digs into his roots to create
a distinct reggae-sleaze groove.
Bob Marley's. approval of this
song is pending.
Mars jumped from previous
hits like "The Lazy Song" - a
catchy tune seemingly inspired
by every Barney and Friends
soundtrack since 1992 - to tell-
ing his "Treasure" that she's "a
sexy motherfucker" in the dance-
ready, funk-pop jam. The contrast
generated between his previous
hits and recent work is a tad dis-
tasteful, and creepy as well.
Bruno Mars wants to run
with the big dogs and ditch his
female-dominated demograph-
ic, quite understandably. But
Mars is the complete package
- singer, dancer, writer, pro-
ducer - and is far too talented
to shoot for cheap shock tac-
tics, especially this early in his
career. Then again, it's better
to be a try-hard than a sellout.
Fortunately, the quality songs
and fairly distinguished style of
Unorthodox Jukebox mask many
of the bizarre sexual overtones.

ALBUM REVIEW
Big Boi holds his own

By JOHN LYNCH
Daily Arts Writer
It's very possible that Antwan

of the separated rap supergroup,
OutKast - will

the world may never again hear
the dominant duo that produced
game changing, chart-topping
songs like "Ms. Jackson" and
"The Way You Move."
One listen through his second
solo album, Vicious Lies and Dan-
gerous Rumors, however, proves
that Big Boi can still revolution-
ize the rap game without Andre
or a hit single. Rather than shoot
for the top of the charts with
his songs - which, nowadays,
seems to require a Rihanna hook,
a 2 Chainz feature and several
will.i.am adlibs on a track - Big
Boi has quietly forged a cohesive
and singular rap album through
unexpected collaboration and
bold experimentation.
With a guest list that ranges
from rappers like Kid Cudi and
T.I. to indie bands like Phanto-
gram and Little Dragon, VLADR
