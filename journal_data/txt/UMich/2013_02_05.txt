questions
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily News Editor
At Monday's meeting of
the University's Senate Advi-
sory Committee on University
Affairs, members heard from
the University's new general
counsel, Timothy Lynch. SACUA
members questioned him on a
variety of legal issues that fac-
ulty commonly face as well as
more complex compliance and
reporting issues, including the
child abuse scandal that rocked
Pennsylvania State University.
Lynch assumed his role as
the University's chief lawyer
on Jan. 7 following the resigna-
tion of Suellyn Scarnecchia in
May. During his legal career,
Lynch worked as an associate
with Washington-based Shea &
Gardner, an assistant U.S. attor-
ney, an assistant chief litigation
counsel with the U.S. Securities
and Exchanges Commission and,
most recently, as the deputy gen-
eral counsel for U.S. Department
of Energy.
No stranger to academia, he
has also taught at the University
of Virginia School of Law and

Asian InterVaristy
constitution stays
unchanged despite
'U' concerns
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
The Asian InterVarsity Vel-
lowship gained University rec-
ognition as an official campus
organization Monday afternoon,
a decision that came on the heels
of allegations last week that the
club was kicked off campus over
University non-discrimination
policy violations.
University spokeswoman
Kelly Cunningham said the club
failed to meet the Sept. 30 annu-
al re-registration deadline but
completed the process Monday
without having to change their
constitution, which outlines reli-
gious criteria for selecting the
group's leaders. Such criteria are
in violation of the University's
policy.
Cunningham said the Univer-
sity discussed the missed dead-
line with Asian InterVarsity in
December. After a re-registra-
tion meeting scheduled for last
week was postponed because of
scheduling conflicts, stakehold-
ers convened Monday to discuss

Athletes rock out Hill

Jalen Rose emcees
annual charity
talent show
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
Monday night's Mock Rock nearly start-
ed without its emcee, Jalen Rose..
Rose, who was scheduled to arrive at
6 p.m., didn't enter the building until 7:10
- 10 minutes after the show's scheduled
starting time. But once he got on stage, he
was full of the flair and charisma that made
him a famous member of the Fab Five.
In his first minute on stage, Rose
acknowledged the hottest team on campus,

the basketball team, which wasn't in atten-
dance because of its game with Ohio State
on Tuesday.
"Don't be surprised if this team does all
of the things we weren't able to do," Rose
said. "And let me just name a couple of
them: win the Big Ten ... and wina Nation-
al Championship. How awesome would
that be?
"I want the problem of making sure
that I'm joined by Juwan Howard, Ray
Jackson, Jimmy Rind and Chris Webber
courtside watching them cut down the
nets this year."
But Rose then mellowed the tone to
hono: the life of former Michigan wres-
tler Jeff Reese, who tragically passed away
during midseason training in 1997. Mock
Rock originated in 1999 to raise funds for

the Jeff Reese Endowed Scholarship. After
the scholarship fund became substantially
subsidized, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital
became the primarybeneficiary. After rais-
ing more than $90,000 last year, the event's
hosts, the Student-Athlete Advisory Com-
mittee, hoped that this year's event would
raise over $100,000.
"I just want to acknowledge that there's
a reason why the wrestling team goes first,"
Rose said, before instructing halfthe crowd
to say"Jeff," the otherto say, "Reese," while
he finished with "Rest in peace."
But when the wrestling team appeared
on stage moments later in tight neon outfits
with "Chariots of Fire" playing, the spirited
atmosphere was set for the evening.
Rose displayed impressive humor

Gentrification,
energy efficiency
planned for
commercial area
By MATTHEW JACKONEN
Daily StaffReporter
On Monday night, the Ann
Arbor City Council approved the
distribution of the draft master
plan for the South State Street Cor-
ridor Plan. Council members also
discussed the Feb. 4 rape report
and the allocation of energy funds.
The corridor plan,. which has
been discussed since Oct. 2011,
plots the future of what is known
as the State Street corridor - the
stretch of State Street between
Stimson Street and West Riling-
ton Street. This stretch of land
contains vital University prop-
erty, including South Campus,
the University golf course and
Briarwood Mall.
The plan aims to promote
development, improve the
appearance of the corridor, sus-
tainability and economic vigor
along the corridor. It holds any
proposed development to high
environmental and public safety
standards. It also includes a rec-
ommendation to demolish cer-
tain small commercial buildings
in order to create more efficient,
high-rise livingspace.
The draft will come back to
the council for further discussion
at a later date and could include
the addition of amendments to
the plan.

KUNSELMAN DISCUSSES
TAXICAB REGULATIONS
FOLLOWING
SEXUAL ASSVAULT
Councilmember Stephen Kun-
selman, the Democratfrom Ward
3, also spoke out in response to
the reported rape of a female
University student this Sunday
during open commentary.
University Police released a
crime alertregarding the incident
Sunday. Kunselman proposed
that the City Council crack down
on certain' taxi, companies that
operate without licensing within
Ann Arbor.
"It brings forth the issues
we've been grappling with ... the
issues of rogue limos," Kunsel-
man said. "We have been worried
about that for some time, and it is
time for this council, this admin-
istration and the police depart-
ment to take action."
Kunselman said because he
holds a spot on the Ann Arbor
Taxicab Board, he would push for
more accountability and licensing.
"The one thing I can do about
it as the chair is to. start asking
for a monthly report at our taxi-
cab board meetings about what
enforcement activities are taking
place," Runselman said.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
said he agreed with Kunselman,
noting that the city should do
more to solve this issue.
COUNCIL DISCUSSES
PACE BONDS
The Council also postponed

the vote on a resolution to autho-
rize the allocation of property-
assessed clean energy bonds.
The resolution, which resolves
the allocation of up to $1 mil-
lion in PACE bonds, was inserted
Monday before the council meet-
ing.
The city created the PACE
program after receiving a
$432,800 Energy Efficiencfand
Conservation Block Grant from
the U.S. Department of Energy.
The program intends to improve
commercial energy use and
help businesses within the city
finance clean energy improve-
ments.
The resolution proposes to
allocate these funds to various
properties across Ann Arbor in
the hopes of increasing the use
of clean energy. Whether or not
the properties mentioned in the
resolution are in most need of
the funds in terms of clean ener-
gy is unclear.
Hieftje said he doesn't think
postponing the vote is an issue
and expressed his satisfaction
at the near culmination of the
process.
"I don't think it matters at
all," Hieftje said. "It is a very
exciting move. There have
been a lot of people that have
been working on this program
for years, and I will be very
joyful when we get this under
way. But we do still have a lit-
tle bit of time given the time
frame that has been set for us
with the backstop fund that
has been set up by the federal
government."

Officials hope
ranking will spur
development
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
To an intimate crowd on
Monday morning, Motty - the
C.S. Mott Children's Hospital
mascot - pulled down the ban-
ner that officially revealed the
hospital has been named the
eighth best children's hospital
in the nation by Parents maga-
zine.

This announcement marks
the first time that the hospital
was ranked in the top 10 by the
magazine, which has circula-
tion around 2.2 million. Chris
Dickinson, interim executive
director of the hospital, told
the crowd that the acknowledg-
ment is a major milestone for
the hospital.
"We are thrilled to make this
announcement and very proud
of this accomplishment and
what it means for the organiza-
tion," Dickinson said. "We are
thrilled to be recognized by a
magazine trusted by so many
parents for advice on raising

healthy children."
Dickinson said in an inter-
view after the event that he
believed the new facility,
whichopened in Dec. 2011, is a
hidden gem of the University.
"I've been here since 1984,
and I love this place, I love what
we do here," Dickinson said.'
"We do a lot of unusual, great
things for kids, and I bet that
a lot of the students don't even
know that there's a children's
hospital here. So I'm hoping
that this recognition and valida-
tion for all the good work that
we do there."

UNIVERSITY STUDENTS PROTEST GEOdDE IN DARUt
To fight genocide, go without

K SKEEPS

50 years ago this week
(December 8,1962):
After returning from a trip
to East Asia, then-University
President Harlan Hatcher
urged the use of English as
the language of international
communication, the Daily
reported.
At a public reception in Hill
Auditorium, Hatcher said the
first objective of American
universities should be keeping
English as an international
language. He reported the
decreasinguse of English in
the nations he visited and
cited the University's English
Language Institute in Thai-
land as an important project
combating this trend.

25 years ago this week
(December 4,1987):
Then-Vice President George
H. W. Bush visited Oakland and
urged Michigan Senate Repub-
licans to ratify the intermediate
nuclear arms treaty that was to
be signed by President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gor-
bachev, the Daily reported.
At an "Ask George Bush
Town Meeting," Bush
addressed about 300 people
on the elimination of weapons,
urging attendees to demon-
strate their support.
"We're about to get a deal
where the Soviets take out all
1,600 (weapons) and we take out
our 400, and for the first time in
history eliminate a whole class

of weapons," he said.
5years ago this week
(December 6,2007):
A campaign organized by the
national anti-genocide student
organization STAND encour-
aged students to give up one
luxury item from their daily
lives to help protect displaced
Sudanese civilians in Darfur,
according to the Daily.
Instead of buying her daily
latte, LSA senior Alice Mishkin
chose to give $3 to victims of the
genocide in Darfur.
"If you only spend $3, then
you could protect a woman in
Darfur for a day - that's pretty
ridiculous," said LSA freshman
Joe Pieroni.

People of Timbuktu save
manuscripts during violence

Islamists set fire to
one of world's most
precious library of
ancient scripts
TIMBUKTU, Mali (AP) - For
eight days after the Islamists set
fire to one of the world's most
precious collections of ancient
manuscripts, the alarm inside
the building blared. It was an
eerie, repetitive beeping, a cry
from the innards of the injured
library that echoed around the
world.
The al-Qaida-linked extrem-
ists who ransacked the insti-
tute wanted to deal a final blow
to Mali, whose northern half
they had held for 10 months
before retreating in =the face of
a French-led military advance.
They also wanted to deal a blow
to the world, especially France,
whose capital houses the head-
quarters of UNESCO, the orga-
nization which recognized and
elevated Timbuktu's monu-
ments to its list of World Heri-
tage sites.
So as they left, they torched
the Ahmed Baba Institute of
Higher Learning and Islamic
Research, aiming to destroy a
heritage of 30,000 manuscripts
that date back to the 13th cen-
tury.
"These manuscripts are our
identity," said Abdoulaye Cisse,
the library's acting director.
"It's through these manuscripts
that we have been able to recon-
struct our own history, the his-
tory of Africa. People think that
our history is only oral, not writ-
ten. What proves that we had a
written history are these docu-
ments."
The first people who spotted
the column of black smoke on
Jan.23 were the residents whose
homes surround the library,
and they ran to tell the center's
employees. The bookbinders,
manuscript restorers and secu-
rity guards who work for the
institute broke down and cried.
Just about the only person

who didn't was.Cisse, the act-
ing director, who for months
had harbored a secret. Starting
last year, he and a handful of
associates had conspired to save
the documents so crucial to this
1,000-year-old town.
In April, when the rebels
preaching a radical version of
Islam first rolled into this city
swirling with sand, the insti-
tute was in the process of mov-
ing its collection into a new,
state-of-the-art building. The
fighters commandeered the new
center, turning it into a dormi-
tory for one of their units of for-
eign fighters, Cisse said. They
didn't realize only about 2,000
manuscripts had been moved
there, the bulk of the collection
remaining at the old library, he
said.
The Islamists came in, as
they did in Afghanistan, with
their own, severe interpretation
of Islam, intent on rooting out
what they saw as the venera-
tion of idols instead of the pure
worship of Allah. During their
10-month-rule, they eviscerated
much of the identity of this sto-
ried city, starting with the mau-
soleums of their saints, which
were reduced to rubble.
The turbaned fighters made
women hide their faces and
blotted out their images on bill-
boards. They closed hair salons,
banned makeup and forbade the
music for which Mali is known.
Their final act before leaving
was to go through the exhibi-
tion room in the institute, as
well as the whitewashed labora-
tory used to restore the age-old
parchments. They'grabbed the
books they found and burned
them.
However, they didn't both-
er searching the old building,
where an elderly man named
Abba Alhadi has spent 40 of his
72 years on earth taking care of
rare manuscripts. The illiterate
old man, who walks with a cane
and looks like a character from
the Bible, was the perfect foil
for the Islamists. They wrongly
assumed that the city's Europe-
an-educated elite would be the

ones trying to save the manu-
scripts, he said.
So last August, Alhadi began
stuffing the thousands of books
into empty rice and millet sacks.
At night, he loaded the mil-
let sacks onto the type of trolley
used to cart boxes of vegetables
to the market He pushed them
across town and piled them into
a lorry and onto the backs of
motorcycles, which drove them
to the banks of the Niger River.
From there, they floated
down to the central Malian
town of Mopti in a pinasse, a
narrow, canoe-like boat. Then
cars drove them from Mopti,
the first government-controlled
town, to Mali's capital, Bamako,
over 600 miles (1,000 kilome-
ters) from here.
"I have spent my life protect-
ing these manuscripts. This has
been my life's work. And I had
to come to terms with the fact
that I could no longer protect
them here," said Alhadi. "It hurt
me deeply to see them go, but I
took strength knowing that they
were being sent to a safe place."
It took two weeks in all to
spirit out the bulk of the col-
lection, around 28,000 texts
housed in the old building cov-
ering the subjects of theology,
astronomy, geography and more.
There was nothing they could
do, however, for the 2,000 docu-
ments that had already been
transferred to the new library,
to its exhibition and restora-
tion rooms, and to a basement
vault. Cisse took solace knowing
that most of the texts in the new
library had been digitized.
Even so, when his staff came
to tell him about the fire, he felt
a constriction in his chest.
The new library is housed
inside a modern building, whose
sheer walls are made to resem-
ble the mud-walled homes of
Timbuktu. Cisse braved his fear
to slip through the back gate on
the morning of Jan. 24.
The alarm was still scream-
ing. The empty manuscript
boxes were , strewn on the
ground outside in the brick
courtyard.

DETROIT, MI
Detroit-area man
guilty in Toledo
sports probe
A Detroit-area businessman
has pleaded guilty to conspiracy
in a point-shaving investigation
involving football and basketball
at the University of Toledo in
2004-06.
Mitchell "Ed" Karam . also
pleaded guilty to conspiring to
fix horse races at Tampa Bay
Downs in Florida and Delaware
Downs in Delaware in 2005 and
2006. His guilty plea also covers
a fraud charge in a separate real

nearly four years after he was
indicted in the Toledo probe
along with another Detroit busi-

a 5-year-old boy had been held
hostage for nearly a week, rescu-

Steve Richardsonwith the FBI's
office in Mobile said at a news
conference Monday afternoon
that negotiations had deteriorat-

Officers stormed the bunker
just after 3 p.m. CST to rescue the
child, who was taken to a hospital
in nearby Dothan. Officials have
said the child has Asperger's syn-

A little more than a decade ago,
Querevalu's 8-ton wooden boat

"There used to be fish for every-

captain laments, leaning on the
rail as a stiff breeze buffets his
leathery brow. "You'd run into
immense schools."
VIENNA, AUSTRIA

Diplomacy failed
to slow Iran
nuclear program
Judging by its expanding
nuclear program, harsh sanctions
against Iran have done little but
impose hardship on its people,
while diplomacy has also failed to
slow the Islamic Republic's atomic
progress. And while more talks
are planned for later this month,
there is a growing sense that the
nuclear standoff between Iran
and the international community
is reaching a tipping point.
Iran can theoretically back
down. But because it insists that
all of its nuclear work is peaceful
and protected by international
law itis unlikelytogo further than
repeating its top leader's religious
edicts against nuclear weapons in
pushing for an end to sanctions.
That in turn will lead to another
negotiating failure - and mount-
ing pressure for military inter-
vention to prevent Tehran from
becoming a threshold nuclear
weapons power.
Each side wants what the other
is bringing to the table at the
planned Feb. 25 talks in Kazakh-
stan. The problem is that both
want the other to blink first.

throughout the night. Between
a pair of skits, he walked on
stage wearing a headset, mak-
ing fun of football coach Brady
Hoke, who notoriously doesn't
wear one. Hoke, who was in the
crowd, laughed and later made
a backstage pledge to
visit Rose's charter
school in Detroit, the
Jalen Rose Leadership Acad-
emy, which was the event's sec-
ond beneficiary.
A laughing Rose said that
he never could've imagined 20
years ago, when he was a stu-
dent, that he'd one day be back
on campus raising money for a
school with his name on it.
Rose even jokingly told the
crowd that because of the tough
nature of his school and its long
days, which run until 4:30 p.m.
each day, that he wouldn't want
to attend his school.

"(As athletes) we're so
blessed, with our athletic
prowess, that you want to do
something to give back to oth-
ers," Rose said. "I've dedicated
a lot of my life and you'd be sur-
prised how doing things like
this and exposing them to what
it really means to help someone
else ... that extra effort really
translates to young men and
young women when they grow
older."
Rose showed comedic cama-
raderie with the event's judges,
2012 Olympic gold medalist
and current Michigan water
polo assistant coach Betsey
Armstrong, Olympian and
former Michigan hurdler Jeff
Porter and Mott patient Kaitlin
Huff. When Rose questioned
why Porter gave the wrestling
team a 7.5 score out of 10, rath-
er than a seven or eight, Por-
ter didn't give a clear answer.
When Rose pressed on, Porter
said, "I learned from you on
ESPN how to avoid answering
a question," drawing a chorus

of laughs from the crowd.
The night's biggest laughs
came from the hockey team,
which sent members of its
freshmen class on stage in tight
neon spandex pants and fish-
net tops. The team, known for
edgy skits such as its one that
featured pink-bikini clad play-
ers two years ago, first danced
to "Cotton Eye Joe," and later
performed a series of provoca-
tive pelvic thrusts with Eric
Prydz's "Call on Me" playing.
The night's big winner was
the men's rowing team, which
danced to a medley of Lion
King songs while wearing
intricate costumes. The rowers
were the only team to receive
straight los from the judges,
edging out the men's and wom-
en's track and field and cross
country teams' 9.7 score. The
men's and women's golf teams,.
which danced to a medley of
songs including "Thrift Shop,"
received the "Better Luck Next
Year" award for their show-
worst 6.2 score.

MOTT

He added that the accomplish-
ment was achieved by the entire
staff including "pharmacy, and
nurses, and respiratory thera-
pists, and facility (workers), all
working together ... to ensure
that we're giving our families the
best experiences possible."
Hospitals on the list were
evaluated by Parents magazine
editors and a team of medical
advisors. Hospitalswere rated on
several factors, includingstaffing
ratios, depth of research, surviv-
al rates for serious diseases and
availability of family services.
Pediatric department chair
Valerie Castle said the publica-
tion reputation adds to the value
of the honor.
"Parents is a highly regarded
magazine for informing parents
about healthy choices for their
kids," Castle said. "We have
patients that come from all over
the world for our care and some
of the things that we do here are
very advanced."
Castle added that the honor is
significant for families with chil-
dren with "rare or complex dis-
eases," because it's a validation of
the care they offer.
Awards of this nature can
impact recruitment of faculty
and development of new clinical
programs.
"I think this distinction is

important when you're trying
to recruit talent from across the
country to come to the Univer-
sity of Michigan health system,"
she said.
Loree Collett, assistant direc-
tor of Mott, echoed the senti-
ments of progress, addressing the
recent changes the hospital has
undergone to achieve its stand-
ing.
"In our old facility, compared
toournew facility,we were doing
expert care and research, but we
struggled with reputation and
the right facility," Collett said.
"I think that the building has
provided us a better opportu-
nity to provide better care to our
patients, especially the ability for
parents to stay in the rooms 24/7
with their child."
Collett said the award from
the family-focused magazine is
reflective of UMHS's values.
"In our hospital particularly,
because we're focused on chil-
dren's and women's care, we're
really trying to continue patient
and family focused care," she
said. "The doctors now do rounds
and engage the moms and dads
as they talk about their child that
day, to teach them what they're
learning about caring for their
child every day."
The response from the
administrators was unanimous.
Though they're proud of the
accomplishment, Mott plans to
keep improving service and care
until they are number one.

reinstatement.
The re-registration pro-
cess included discussion of the
chapter's constitution, which
requires elected leaders to recite
a statement of faith, a clause that
contradicts University non-dis-
crimination protocols.
"Part of the process is to
bring up anything that might
be of interest and to have a dia-
logue about that," Cunningham
said.
Sara Chang, a local Inter-
Varsity recruiter, attended the
meeting that included campus
ministers, staff from the Uni-
versity's Center for Campus
Involvement, InterVarsity rep-
resentatives and student lead-
ers.
According to Chang's recol-

lection of the meeting, the Uni-
versity clarified their concerns
about aspects of the constitu-
tion and asked the club to con-
sider revisions.
When club representatives
said they would not change
their constitution, the Universi-
ty offered an alternative: Asian
InterVarsity could continue to
operate under their current pol-
icies but would not be protected
under the University's non-dis-
crimination policy. As a result,
the University would not be
responsible for grievances filed
against the club on the basis of
the University's non-discrimi-
nation policy.
At the end of the meeting,
Chang said University and
club representatives verbally
"agreed to disagree" and parted
without receiving club recogni-
tion. She said the club did not
want represent exception to the

University's rules.
The parties agreed to contin-
ue dialogue about revisions to
the University's non-discrimi-
nation policy, which Chang said
she hopes would provide leni-
ency to religious groups seeking
to select religious leaders.
But by Monday afternoon,
the club received an e-mail con-
firmation stating their registra-
tion was complete and had been
officially recognized as a Uni-
versity organization.
"That's not something we had
given verbal consent to," Chang
said.
As of Monday night, Chang
said she is unsure of the condi-
tions surrounding the approval,
including whether the club will
be protected under University
non-discrimination policy.
"That's a question that I'm
very interested in pursuing with
the University.

the Georgetown University Law
Center. Hte earned his under-
graduate degree at the Univer-
sity of Rochester and his law
degree at Georgetown.
During his question-and-
answer session with SACUA,
Lynch was cautious with his
words - careful not to speak
too specifically about hypotheti-
cal situations. The University
has traditionally not allowed its
legal representatives to speak on
the record to the media because
of concerns about how their
statements could affect future
legal proceedings.
Among the first questions
was to whom Lynch belives
he ultimately answers to as an
executive officer of the Univer-
sity - a theme that popped up
throughout the meeting. Fac-
ulty members, including Biology
Prof. John Lehman asked how
Lynch would deal with conflicts
between the University's Board
of Regents and executive officers
like University President Mary

Sue Coleman.
"The constitution gives
regents power over the Univer-
sity," Lynch said. "My goal here
is to represent Mary Sue, the
executive officers (and) the Uni-
versity regents ... I have a very
broad and diverse portfolio."
Lynch was also asked about
how he would use faculty input
to form policies that would
affect staffing at the University.
He responded that expertise of
the lawyers in his office provid-
ed much of what he needed but
added that he was always open
to additional input from the gen-
eral faculty body.
"In terms of faculty input,
I hope my faculty committee
will give me good, solid advice,"
Lynch said. "If there are issues
where you want a faculty voice
known to the general counsel's
office, I'd invite you to come by,
and I'd be happy to chat with
you."
One of the main topics of dis-
cussion was the University's
compliance efforts. The faculty
members particularly focused
their discussions on how the
school would handle reporting

an issue like the sex scandal at
Penn State. Members faulted
internal bureaucracy for both
the Penn State case and for the
child pornography case at Uni-
versity Hospital last year.
"A big part of our job in the
counsel's office is compliance.
Having been on the other side
of the aisle here, there is a high'
expectation on the part of gov-
ernment agencies," he said.
Lynch added that the Univer-
sity would immediately contact
law enforcement authorities if
they believed an issue warranted
further investigation.
After Lynch's presentation,
SACUA members briefly dis-
cussed an upcoming faculty
poll as well as the impending,
reapportionment of representa-
tion for each of the constituent
colleges of the University. The
University's library system is
expected to gain one representa-
tive because of the reclassifica-
tion of librarians as staff while
another college is expected to
lose a representative to com-
pensate. A future survey will
determine what college will lose
a seat.

37 dead, dozens
more wounded at
damaged complex
MEXICO CITY (AP) - A gas
buildup ignited by an electri-
cal spark or other heat source
caused the blast that killed 37
people and wounded dozens of
others last week at the state oil
company's headquarters, Mex-
ico's attorney general said.
But Attorney-General Jesus
Murillo Karam said investiga-
tors were still looking for the
source of the gas, and revising
records of building inspections
to determine why Petroleos
Mexicanos had not discovered
the gas accumulation. As a state
company, Pemex is responsible
for inspecting its own buildings.
Murillo said late Monday that
an investigation by Mexican,
Spanish, U.S. and British experts
into the petroleum giant's worst
disaster in more than a decade
found no evidence of explosives
in the Thursday afternoon blast
that collapsed several lower
floors of the Pemex administra-
tive building.
He said the investigators
believe that an electrical spark
or other source of heat had deto-
nated the gas.
With the exception of three
victims, none of those killed
had the burn marks or dam-
aged ear drums that are typical
evidence of a bombing, he said.
Nor was there any sign of a cra-
ter or fracturing of the build-
ing's steel beams, also common
signs of the detonation of an
explosive device.
Murillo said officials had yet
to discover the source of what
initial evidence indicated to be

methane gas that leaked froii
a duct or tunnel or came from
the sewer system and built up
in the basement of the building.
Murillo said that an inde-
pendent contractor had told
investigators that he was work-
ing with a crew of three men
performing maintenance in
the basement of building, B2.
The contractor said the base-
ment wasn't lit, so his crew had
rigged illumination by attach-
ing a crude electric cable to a
power source in the ceiling.
The contractor told inves-
tigators that seconds after he
moved to a higher floor, he
heard a noise and then the
building was rocked by an
explosion. The three men were
found dead in the lower base-
ment with burn marks, one
with a fragment of cable stuck
to his body. They had no evi-
dence of the dismemberment
typical in the detonation of
explosives.
Murillo described the blast
as a "diffuse" explosion whose
blast moved slowly and hori-
zontally, typical of the detona-
tion of a cloud of gas, rather
than an explosion that would
have emanated from a relative-
ly compact source like a bomb.
He said laboratory tests had
turned up "zero" evidence of
any explosive.
"We've been able to deter-
mine that the explosion was
caused by an accumulation
of gas in the basement of the
building," he said. "This explo-
sion, at its peak, generated
an effect on the structures of
the floors of the building, first
pushingthem up and thencaus-
ing them to fall, and that was
the primary cause of deaths in
the building."

Branded for life
Sex offenders need rehabilitation, not public shaming
The Michigan state Senate unanimously passed a bill on Jan.
2q that would expand the online registry of sex offenders
to include more crimes involving minors. The current law,
overhauled in 2011 to comply with federal regulations, categoriz-
es criminals under three tiers. It requires the names of offenders
who've committed Tier 2 and 3 crimes - including rape and child
pornography - be posted publicly online. Though protecting chil-
dren from the heinous acts of sex offenders must be of paramount
importance, this bill is misguided. As a society we must stop sham-
ing criminals indefinitely, and this bill would only serve to stigma-
tize past offenders and distract from reintegration.

The current registry system is arbitrary. The
rationale used to distinguish between Tier 2
and Tier 3 crimes is ambiguous, which creates
room for abuse. From punishing public urina-
tion for life to labeling high-school couples as
"sex offenders," there's ample evidence that
these abuses are far too common. The proposed
bill does little to alleviate the actual problem
of sexual violence and instead gives courts the
power to hand down the same lifetime registra-
tion sentences to perpetrators of felonies and
misdemeanors alike.
The purpose of laws is to mete out punish-
ments for societal transgressions. When these
lifelong punishments exceed the harm of the
initial crime, our system makes the re-entry
process into normal life excessively difficult.
If criminals have served out their sentences,
paid their debts and wish to reintegrate into
society, then this proposed legislation will bar
them from acclimating back into society - an
injustice in itself.
According to University researcher J.J.
Prescott, public notification requirements have
been shown to actually increase the incidence

of re-offending. This trend has been attributed
to a nothing-left-to-lose mentality that stems
from the psychological and social costs pub-
lic shaming imposes on previous offenders,
making the possibility of living a crime-free
life seem less feasible. Embittering criminals
against society is no way to prevent them from
committing future crimes.
Acceptance of these laws ultimately stands
as a testament to the protection of children.
Crimes perpetrated against young people are
appalling, and offenders deserve to be justly
punished. But the punishment should end at
the final sentencing date; it shouldn't continue
for life. Instead, extend prison terms or set con-
ditions on required rehabilitation programs for
sex offenders.
If this legislation is put into effect, some
crimes that don't even merit fines greater
than $2,000 will now be accompanied with a
public branding for life - sex offender. This
is truly unjust. The Michigan legislature
shouldn't perpetuate the harmful impacts of
the current sex offender registry, and must
not pass this bill.

t has become somewhat of a
commonplace to say that the
Internet has corrupted the
ways we com-
municate - that
people don't
conventionally
date anymore
because a booty
call over text
("whatsup")
will more than
suffice. My gut JENNIFER
response to XU
such a reduc-
tive argument:
Shouldn't the Internet, with all its
portals of communication - text,
e-mail, voice, Skype, etc. - do the
opposite? Shouldn't we be able to
communicate more precisely now
that the modes through which we
can say things are so diverse? Or do
we hold on to the Paleolithic idea
that the only form of communica-
tion that "counts" is the one we
experience face-to-face?
In hindsight, my interpretation is
likely just as reductive. To say that
the Internet has freed up the ways
we communicate is nothing but a
pipe dream. There are so many rules
attached to the websites we frequent;
rules we've created, passed down
and molded into our consciousness.
Below is a sampling of the proto-
cols governing our oft-used commu-
nication tools. If they have anything
in common, it's what happens in
the silences, the time we put into
observing how others utilize these
same tools and negotiating what we
do with that information. The Inter-
net, for all its speed, has ironically
allowed us more time to construct
what we want to say and supplies us
with the "screen courage" to do so.
But a faux pas can lead to devas-
tating repercussions, since screen
text doesn't immediately dissolve
upon transmission as sound waves
do. The result is that the Inter-

net becomes a mutual exchange of
silences, not unlike those experi-
enced in real life.
Facebook: The hall of reflecting
mirrors, Facebook serves as a place
where the things everybody says
to everybody else are registered in
comprehensively organized boxes.
A place to mindlessly scan through
pictures you've already flicked back
and forth 1000-plus times, periodi-
cally untag yourself in unflattering
poses, react in mock-horror when
you find out that the cute guy in your
anthropology class has been stalk-
ing you and blush with embarrass-
ment when you accidentally blurt
out the information that you know
your crush didn't know you knew
because you saw him in a Facebook
photo with Girl X. One picture with
an arm looped around the shoulder
says they're, hooking up; a comment
like "haha, fun times" says they're
'semi-public; a winky face says
they're full-public. You've memo-
rized the slight tilt of the baseball
hat. You know which pair of glasses
looksbest onhim. Unfriendingis the
worst form of punishment.
Twitter: A combination of navel-
gazing and self-indulgence (why
would anybody care what brand of
shower gel you bought from CVS?)
with a smidge of voyeurism (the
answer: everyone). Followers and
RTs serve as something of a curren-
cy. The more followers you have, the
more time you spend agonizing over
your allotted 140 characters..
Tumblr: Curated, aesthetic pieces
of self where taste divisions become
most evident. No followers, unless
you're a cult sensation who posts cute
pictures of babies in hats, although
it's a no-no to reveal just how many
followers you have. Anonymity is
the rule rather than the exception,
which acts as both a positive (you can
show your "true" personality!) and a
negative (the "Ask me anything" box
where haters gonnahate).

Pinterest: See above, but nix
the anonymity and add an excess of
hair tutorials, recipes and inspira-
tional quotes.
The Internet gives us
the 'screen courage'
to say what we can't
say face-to-face.
Gmail: Truly your own per-
sonal space - it's not for anyone's
eyes but yours - but it's also the
most devoid of any personality. You
check your e-mail like a drug habit.
Though the "You've got mail!" ping
is long defunct, the Pavlovian sen-
timent remains. Most messages in
your inbox are sent by machines
- advertisements with J. Crew
"FINAL SALE" urgency sitting
alongside office hours notifications
from CTools.
Most of us have weaned ourselves
away from our childhood usernames
and exclamation point ridden signa-
tures. Our Google profiles consist of
our real-life names (maybe a period
or number separating the first and
last names because there's just too
many of you in the world) and a head
and shoulders profile picture, usu-
ally just slightly better looking than
your actual face. The biggest deci-
sion we make when writing e-mails
is whether to use "best" or "thanks"
following a sign-off. The unread
messages in your inbox serve as
the constant deferral of what might
come, and also the promise that
there's always someone out there
who wants to speak to you.
Google+: Um; what's this for
again?

Ensure tuition equality

a
a

Cap climate change

On Feb. 1, University President Mary Sue
Coleman finally broke her silence on the
issue of tuition equality. As a coalition repre-
senting nearly 30 student organizations, we
thank her for this. We've been asking for a
public statement from Coleman for months so
that we can finally start talking to each other,
rather than past each other, about the issues
at hand.
Unfortunately, the message she delivered
was not one that we - or the 29,000 undoc-
umented students in the state of Michigan
- wanted to hear. Instead of embracing the
moment and leading on the issue,,she has
come out and said, "Let's wait and see."
Undocumented students who want to join
the class of 2017 don't have time to wait.
They've studied, worked incredibly hard and
were accepted to the University, but cannot
afford to pay the high out-of-state or interna-
tional tuition rates. The average undocument-
ed family has an annual income of around
$25,000 and without a nine-digit social secu-
rity number cannot receive federal or state
financial aid. By denying them their right to
in-state tuition, the University is effectively
barring them from enrolling as a student.
This is an act of deliberate discrimination by
our University against every single undocu-
mented student in the state of Michigan.
President Coleman said, "I am very encour-
aged with the discussion thatis going on at the
federal level because I don't think this should
be solved piecemeal." Let's translate that.
What she means is that she's happy to wait
for federal government to act rather than
doing everything within her power to help
the undocumented population in our state.
The "discussion" happening at the federal
level is far from progressive and likely will
not pass before the end of the year if it passes
at all, considering the high levels of partisan-
ship in Washington. Further, the effect it will
have on undocumented youth is hazy at best.
The mysterious "piecemeal" change isntuition
equality, which Coleman glosses over in favor
of sexier immigration talking points.
She clearly does not understand the core
issue at stake. She said, "I care deeply about
the students who come here from other coun-
tries and get an advanced degree and have to
go back." The 29,000 undocumented students

didn't come here to get an advanced degree;
they came here - often through no fault of
their own - at young ages so that their fami-
lies could be successful. None of them come to
the state of Michigan simply to go to college.
Almost wistfully, she said, "I would love
to have the same circumstances (as Califor-
nia) here, but we don't." She's referring to the
fact that the California legislature passed a
bill legalizing tuition equality. What Cole-
man fails to mention is that the University is
constitutionally autonomous, meaning that
we have grounds to interpret federal law and
act. In referencing California and advocat-
ing for "state provisions," Coleman is clearly
passing the buck and shirking responsibility
away from her administration. The question
then becomes not how we can act, but when.
When will you stand up to our creed as "the
leaders and best?" When will you stand up and
take the lead on this issue as you did for affirma-
tive action? When will you demonstrate your
support for undocumented students through
actions rather than words alone?
The Latina/o Studies Program within the
Department of American Culture recently
wrote a letter to Coleman. They urged our
University to lead on tuition equality: "Insti-
tutions of higher education throughout the
U.S. have taken brave positions on this issue
because they realize what is at stake: if immi-
grants are barred from real access to higher
education they will undoubtedly become a
permanent underclass." If our University
does not act soon, we will play a key role in the
creation and subjugation of that underclass.
The shift in rhetoric around immigration
at the federal and state level is promising and
a sign for hope. But hope alone will not affect
change. We have no idea how long it will be
before the proposed changes are enacted or
what those changes will mean for Michi-
gan's 29,000 undocumented students. What
we do know is that we can act now. What we
do know is that we can change our residency
requirements - as 12 states have already done
- to allow undocumented students to pay in-
state tuition. We must seize this opportunity.

As a native of the Pacific
Northwest, I've always
enjoyed the stunning scen-
ery the region
has to offer.
From the Cas-
cade Mountains
and Mount
Rainier to Olym-
pic National
Park, I find it
hard to leave
when I have to PAUL
return to Michi- SHERMAN
gan - even with
the beauty of the
Great Lakes and Upper Peninsula.
However, I'm increasingly worried
about the disastrous effects that
changes in the climate could have
on these national treasures. There's
one solution that would provide the
best bang for our buck: a cap-and-
trade system.
The idea of cap-and-trade has
been around for a while; however,
Americans have never taken it seri-
ously. This system would require
all manufacturers to purchase the
right to emit pollution in a market-
place and allow them to buy and
sell those rights. However, cur-
rent legislation does not consider
the effects of many chemicals. For
future legislation, Americans can-
not focus only on carbon dioxide
emissions. Companies and legisla-
tors must implement a cap-and-
trade system that will attempt to
reduce many harmful chemical
emissions, including carbon diox-
ide, sulfur dioxide and methane.
A cap-and-trade system would
actually be a better financial move
than people may expect. Three
years ago, President Barack Obama
announced a cap-and-trade plan
that would raise $645 billion in
revenue from the government-
run emissions auctions over eight
years. In January 2012, California
Gov. Jerry Brown predicted that
the state would earn a projected $1
billion through cap-and-trade auc-
tions. Those companies that have
already reduced their emissions

would not have a need for those
credits, so they would sell them to
other companies. This would pro-
vide additional revenues for those
companies and possibly help revi-
talize struggling industries.
Along with the economic benefits
of the system, electricity costs will be
driven down. Since 2009, a coalition
of Northeastern states has imposed a
cap-and-trade system on the electric
utility sector. In that time, electricity
bills in those states reducedby a total
of $1.3 billion. Additionally, a study
conducted by the Analysis Group
said there'd be an overall reduc-
tion in energy costs of $1.1 billion
by charging electricity companies
for their carbon dioxide emissions,
meaning "average savings of $25 for
residential consumers, $181 for com-
mercial consumers and $2,493 for
industrial consumers." Over time, a
cap-and-trade system will reallocate
energy production to different types
of alternative energy, encouraging
more production from these sources
and eventually increased energy
production.
More importantly, the envi-
ronmental benefits from cap-and-
trade will be substantial. If climate
change continues at the same rate,
the Brookings Institute estimates
that greenhouse gas emissions will
cause roughly $100 billion worth
of damage over the next decade
and about $1.3 trillion dollars by
2050, according to 2010 emissions
figures. In the same article, the
think tank estimates that by levy-
ing a cap-and-trade system, ,the
costs would be lowered substan-
tially. If legislation is enacted now,
the total global benefit will add up
to between $1.5 trillion and $1.7
trillion by 2050, according to 2010
emissions figures.
State governments, including
California's, are already starting to
enact these policies. According to
the Regional Greenhouse Gas Ini-
tiative, carbon dioxide emissions
from power plants in nine East
Coast states that have enacted cap-
and-trade policies fell on average by

about 23 percent over a three-year
period. Lowering carbon dioxide
emissions will reduce the chanceofa
warmer planet, which could prevent
more environmental catastrophes
and higher costs from storm dam-
age. A cap-and-trade system will be
able to harness the power of markets
to find the lowest possible cost to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The cap-and-trade
system will combat
global warming;
but only if we let it.
However, other chemicals, such
as methane, have been left out of
the conversation even though they
may have an even greater impact
on climate change. According to
an Aug. 2010 The New York Times
article, climate experts have said
that a chemical known as 1IFC-
23 "has the potential to trap about
12,000 times as much heat asa mol-
ecule of CO2" when it's released
into the atmosphere. Going for-
ward, these types of emissions need
to be focused on, too - their impact
on our environment could be much
greater than that of carbon dioxide.
This issue is going to become
unavoidable as climate conditions
worsen. Anericans must imple-
ment a cap-and-trade system now
as opposed to creating reactionary
measures that will only serve as
Band-Aids. Covering up the future
environmental challenges will cost
Americans and the planet much
more in the long term. Hopefully,
I'll still be able to enjoy the beauti-
ful natural environments that I've
grown to know and love, whether
in Washington state, Michigan or
elsewhere on earth.

Charming Hoult enlivens
humor of 'Warm Bodies'

The tear-
inducing power
o f cinema

Teen love explored
through the
newly undead
By NOAH COHEN
Daily Arts Writer
"Warm Bodies" fosters the
vision that not everything is as
ruined as it seems, and that by
keeping faith,
you can un-ruin
what 'a more

would've given Bod
up for lost. This

teenager and
exhumes it, digs up . some dead
hope and suggests that the faith it
takes to dig something up - even
just to really look at it - has the
power to resurrect it.
. An analogue of "Romeo and
Juliet," where the zombies play the
Montagues, it would be easy to say
that this movie is a dorky parody
of a love stpry, but it isn't; it's a love
story in its own right, and where
Romeo and Juliet walked hand-
in-hand toward death, R (Nicholas
Hoult, "Skins") and Julie (Teresa
Palmer, "Bedtime Stories") walk
hand-in-hand in the opposite
direction, which makes "Warm
Bodies" an unprecedented take
on the classic tragedy by being the
diametric opposite: a comedy. Only
in a context such as this, where a
lover literally begins the tale from
the point of death, could there
be such a perfectly symmetrical
inversion of Shakespeare's horror
story. Opportunity noticed, oppor-
tunity seized.
Though definitely a comedy in
the classical sense of the word,

"I can see your halo."
whether this movie takes- itself
seriously is constantly in question,
which, of course, makes it lethally
funny. Every zombie grunt and
comically wide-eyed expression
contains elements of "Titanic"
gravity and Marx Brothers hilar-
ity. But in the same way "Arrested
Development," when described
to someone who's never seen it,
doesn't seem funny or special,
"Warm Bodies" favors a humor
impossible to essentialize. Maybe
it's the genius of Nicholas Hoult
that does the trick.
The young man who plays the
zombie named "R," Hoult, is stag-
geringly brilliant. Ordinarily, one
might criticize this sort of movie
for making the good zombies
prettier than the bad zombies,
but no one can accuse Hoult of
being cast on looks alone (he has
been accused of this in the past,
but only because the man is just
dead sexy). His comedic timing,
his endearing hesitancy and the
compromises he makes between
playing a zombie and playing a
boy in love, showcase his natural

ease with weird expectations. His
choices, and the direction he's
given in this movie, are dead on.
What really killed it, though,
was Hoult's deadpan narration.
It was mild and unforced enough
that the scriptwriting, which
could have been emphasized past
its humor and sunk the whole
film, was instead laid out tepidly
and without' pretense. This affa-
bly unhappy zombie, R, outlines
his worries and feelings as though
a casual conversation with the
audience wasn't even the slightest
danger to the fourth wall, and it
isn't, because Hoult doesn't worry
that it will be. Hoult's experience
with overdub in the British TV
show "Skins" made him the per-
fect casting forthis part. From Rob
Corddry ("The Daily Show") as R's
best zombie-friend, M, to the unac-
countably likable Analeigh Tipton
("Crazy, Stupid, Love.") playing
Julie's best friend, Nora, the whole
film is cast to the nines.
"Warm Bodies" understands
why a zombie romance is unlike-
ly, and this self-awareness lends

it the narrative room to admit
wholeheartedly to the faults of
zombie culture, and this becomes
a comment on our own culture.
In the beginning of the movie, R
describes death as, a weakened
obligation towards common
decency and the imperative to
connect with one another, that
being a zombie means ceasing to
reach out to other people. R con-
soles himself by collecting things,
and this is a metaphor for how he
has resisted death.
The idea of storing our human-
ity in small things - memories
of our childhoods, preference of
vinyl over MP3, the tendency to
apologize when we bump into
someone - runs throughout the
screenplay of "Warm Bodies,"
and reminds us, with unexpected
warmth, that we are not trapped,
not dying, not unsalvageable; that
to be lost and suffering is different
than to be defeated. This movie
serves as a bastion of hope in
both the love genre and the zom-
bie genre, and it better fucking
receive its due attention.

"Get your freakum dress on."
'Built for boredom

Male models
become handymen
on new Style series
By EMILY BODDEN
For the Daily
"Built" tears down any
remaining hope for the Style
Network. The producers may
have finally
run out of all C_
ideas for new
programming. Built
The premise
of their newest Pilot
show, "Built," Tuesdays at8p.m.
seems to have
been invented Style
by drawing two
random words from a bowl and
building a series off the combi-
nation. The program revolves
around a team of handymen who
also happen to be male models.
Yep, that's right, the show fea-
tures male models renovating
upscale homes.
The montages of the shirt-
less men fixing homes are sure to
provoke a blush from any bored
housewife. Bad music plays as the
camera focuses in on the perfect
curvature of the "workers." The
trashy tone of "Built" is evident
by the end of the first five minutes.
While handy and handsome,

these models cannot boast high
IQs or eloquence. Their inces-
sant chatter tempts viewers to
hit mute. The more they speak,
the less likeable they are. And
even worse, none of the models
seem to care that they sound
unintelligible. We do get a
hilarious compilation of all the
models talking about what type
of brain they are, though - one
claims to be going through law,
school, which begs the ques-
tion of how he can study, take
part on a TV show and provide
high-end home repair. Another
speaks about how he is a creative
type and "prefers to be called a
visionary."
How did these male models
join forces? Shane, the head of
the operations, recruited a hand-
ful of his male model friends
who had "some" experience in
construction. Fair enough, we'll
let that slide. But then, Donny,
the airhead "pretty one" of the
group, speaks of recruitment
that occurred at a model beach
volleyball tournament. What?
There's really something called
"model beach volleyball?"
To make matters worse,
Donny also utters the phrase,
"Let's go find some nerds." He
says this in reference to his
desire to create some software
(which- has already been invent-
ed) that the head of design was

talking about installing into
their project. The fact that he
says "nerds" makes him sound
like a hyper-masculine heathen.
In one sentence, he manages to
disrespect the value of intelli-
gence, and raise the question of
how he has gotten this far in life.
And now their clients. The first
homeowner, Adina, is the trophy
wife of a lawyer and dons full
makeup and a ball gown to meet
the crew. She hires the team to
turn her 1,000-square-foot closet
into a "dressingsuite."
During introductions, she
makes uncomfortable sexual
comments and won't keep her
hands to herself. She even forces
them to pull up their shirts to
show off their abs within the first
five minutes. This might qualify
as workplace harassment.
The final reveal of Adina's
closet dispels any doubt about
the craftsmanship of the mod-
els. While over the top and
ridiculous, the work appears to
be up to par. The structure of the
show seems not to care about
the actual work but more about
how attractive the workers look
while doing various tasks. This
show is sure tobe ahit for people
who know what they're getting
themselves into, but without
more mainstream viewership,
cancellation looms in the very
near future.

Frightened Rabbits
scribe, a haunted Verse'

By JACKSON HOWARD
DailyArts Writer
Before Mumford & Sons and
their British folkiness captured
the hearts of pseudo-hipster
Americans,
Frightened A-
Rabbit had
already Pedestrian
amassed a Verse
large catalogue
of quality Scot- Frightened
tish folk music Rabbits
that captivated
the Pitchfork Atlantic
crowd and
found success overseas. None-
theless, though the band was
most likely content with its
obscurity in the United States,
there was a natural desire (at a
time when pop-folk -songs like
The Lumineers's "Ho Hey" is a
Top-20 hit) to make a push at the
American audience. The band
signed with Atlantic Records,
and, voila, Pedestrian Verse
emerged.

Fans, breathe easy. Record-
label change aside, the band
sounds exactly the same. And
that's a wonderful thing. Pedes-
trian Verse is full of Frightened
Rabbit's trademark Scottish
folk music. Lead vocalist Scott
Hutchison sounds as confident
and depressed as ever, and while
that may seem like an odd combi-
nation, Frightened Rabbit is one
of the few bands for which that
description actually makes sense.
Pedestrian Verse overflows
with songs about death and
depression, yet Hutchison's
voice and attitude are more along
the lines of "who cares" than
"woe is me." Take "Dead Now,"
where Hutchison sings noncha-
lantly about his somewhat sui-
cidal thoughts. "If we can't bring
an exorcist / I'll settle for one of
your stiffest drinks," he muses
as the band holds down a locked-
in bass-driven groove.
Hutchison takes the self-
loathing even farther on
"Nitrous Gas," a song that begins

as one of the most miserable
songs written in recent memory.
"I'm dying to tell you that I'm
dying here / Throw up the sickly
joy and the swell of the sweet
self-loathing," Hutchison sings,
his voice somehow carrying
little sadness. Then comes the
ending. "And if happiness won't
come to me ... " he continues,
"You can keep all of your oxygen
/ hand me the nitrous gas." The
song suddenly switches from
a depressive anthem to a black
comedy, the exact contradiction
that makes the band so distinct.
Hutchison
probes deep
emotions with
dark humor.
The lyrics on Pedestrian Verse,
as on all the band's albums, are
tremendously deep and elo-
quent. Hutchison's songs dazzle
in their wordiness - at times a
bit too much so - but read out
loud without music they sound
truly incredible.
On "December's Traditions,"
Hutchison reminisces, "Decem-
ber's traditions suck the last
of summer from our cheeks /
draws the curtains / strips the
trees." Building guitars and
howling backing vocals open
the door into Hutchison's mind,
making the song an especially
powerful one.
"The Woodpile," maybe the
best song on the record, serves
as the perfect example of the
band's ability to walk the ever-
so-thin line between introspec-
tion and sappiness, a boundary
crossed way too often in pop
music. Over beating drums and
heavy guitars, Hutchison
unleashes one of Frightened
Rabbit's best choruses, pleading
for someone to rescue him from
his burning loneliness.
There are points in the
album where the band's folky
guitar-and-drum sound feels
monotonous - the songs where
little splashes of piano heard
feel beyond refreshing. But
don't blame the receptiveness
on the band; look to the lyrics,
which definitely take the atten-
tion away from the actual music.
This is far from a bad thing -
in fact, it makes his lyricism
all the more impressive - but
it detracts from a few songs,
like "Holy" and "The Oil Slick,"
which are more lyrical showcas-
es than complete tracks.
"There's something wrong
with me," Hutchison groans on
"Dead Now" - as if it wasn't
clear already - but while he
does sound genuinely sad, he
seems just as happy saying it.
Pedestrian Verse is a wonder-
ful compilation of Scottish folk-
rock, dark humor and clever
storytelling that deserves to be
mentioned with the top albums
of this new year. Just don't sing
it in front of your parents, or
they might think something's
wrong with you, too.

Line combines
for 11 points in
weekend sweep of
Spartans
By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Editor
Not once; not twice but three
times sophomore forward Phil
Di Giuseppe connected with
freshman forward and linemate
Boo Nieves for a goal last week-
end during the Michigan hockey
team's sweep of Michigan State.
Senior forward Kevin Lynch
joined Nieves and Di Giuseppe
on the line, and the trio finished
the weekend with an impressive
11 points.
Nieves, who played a stellar
series the prior weekend despite
Michigan's sweep at the hands
of Western Michigan, contin-
ued his hot streak. He tallied an
assist and two third-period goals
during the Wolverines' 3-2 vic-
tory on Friday night against the
Spartans, one of which ended
up being the game winner. And
then a night later, during Michi-
gan's 5-2 victory, he earned
another multiple-point game
when he scored his seventh goal
of the year and notched his 14th
assist.
Despite the line only scoring
three goals during the week-
end sweep, Di Giuseppe had a
hand in every Nieves goal. Di
Giuseppe came in with nine
assists on the year, but his five
assists upped that total to 14,
which is good enough to tie

Sophomore point guard Trey Burke, a Columbus native, has one win in his career against the Buckeyes.
Burke, Craft at it again

By STEVEl BRAID

Trey Burke can try to deflect
the questions all he wants, and
he can try to play the "the team,
the team, the team" card as much
as he pleases.

will hinge on
whether the Where: Crisler
sophomore Center
point guard TV/Radio:
wins his indi- ESPN
vidual match-
up against Buckeye point guard
Aaron Craft.
Burke and Craft have squared
off four times in their careers,
and Burke has struggled mightily
on the offensive end against his
Ohio State counterpart. In those
four contests, Burke has averaged
12.5 points, 4.5 assists and five
turnovers, while shooting below
33 percent - numbers well below
his career averages. And in their
last meeting, a 56-53 Buckeye
victory three weeks ago, Burke
shot just 4-of-13 from the field
while dishing out four assists and
committing four turnovers.
"We've been trying to find dif-
ferent ways in our scouting to
give Trey the freedom to do some
things, just to get him away from
Craft," said Michigan coach John
Beilein."(Craft) is agood (defend-
er), he's a really good one."
Though Burke has stumbled
against Craft and Ohio State -
he has led the Wolverines to just

one victory against the Buckeyes
- he's looking forward to round
two of 2013, relishing the oppor-
tunity to go against one of the
better defenders in the country.
"I love playing against Craft,"
Burke said. "He's a guy that
makes me work and it's always
a battle. Growing up watching
him, and him watching me - we
played in the same AAU program
- it's just fun playing against
him. Although it's tough because
he makes you work, he makes you
better, believe it or not."
In their first matchup of the
season three weeks ago, Michi-
gan (7-2 Big Ten, 20-2 overall)
came out with very little energy
and fell behind by 21 points mid-
way through the first half. The
Wolverines rallied back, but
it was too little, too late. With
Craft tightly guarding him,
Burke missed a go-ahead 3-point
attempt in the waningseconds.
Michigan will try to be better
prepared this time around. On
the defensive side, Michigan will
hope to contain Ohio State for-
ward Deshaun Thomas. Thomas
led Ohio State (7-2, 17-4) with 20
points and four rebounds when
the two teams last met - he
was the only Buckeye to score
in double digits - and is one of
only three players across the
nation that averages more than
20 points and six rebounds per
game.
But Ohio State won't need
much offense if it can recreate the
defensive intensity it displayed
during the teams' first matchup.
The Buckeyes played one of their
best games defensively against
the high-powered Wolverine
offense - Michigan's 53 points,
22 first-half points and 38-per-

cent shooting from the floor were
all season lows. Ohio State also
forced 13 turnovers, scoring 18
points off of those miscues.
If it's even possible, the Buck-
eyes defense might be even better
now than it was three weeks ago.
In their last five games, they have
allowed an average of 56 points
and have hounded their past four
opponents into shooting worse
than 38 percent from the floor.
"Their defense sets the table
for everything they do," Beilein
said. "And obviously DeShaun
Thomas - he's as talented a play-
er as I've seen in this league."
As for who will start at cen-
ter for Michigan, the decision
hasn't. Redshirt junior Jordan
Morgan, who has been recover-
ing from a right ankle sprain suf-
fered against Illinois a week ago,
sat out against Northwestern last
Wednesday and played just two
ineffective minutes against Indi-
ana on Saturday. Redshirt sopho-
more Jon Horford has started the
past two games in place of Mor-
gan, but saw just I0 minutes of
action against the Hoosiers.
"I'm not sure who will start
tomorrow night," Beilein said.
"Jordan practiced a bit (yester-
day) but there was some soreness
from just playing those two min-
utes (against Indiana). I'm very
happy we did not play him more
the other day."
Between trying to avenge their
loss in Columbus, and avoiding
their first losing streak of the
season, the Wolverines won't be
lacking for motivation.
"They really played a great
game against us in Columbus and
hopefully we've improved since
then," Beilein said. "I expect a
charged-up atmosphere"

King: Webber ready

P.ublication..... .

Thursday, February 14th

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily SportsEditor
Jimmy King is confident that
Chris Webber, the embattled for-
mer Wolverine, will soon be ready
to apologize for his role in the Ed
Martin scandal, and that when he
will, the 1992 and 1993 Final Four
banners will again be able to hang
from the Crisler Center rafters.
Jalen Rose, though, is skeptical
the conversation between Web-
ber and the administration will
ever take place.
Speaking at Monday night's
Mock Rock event, which Rose
emceed, King's outlook on the
ordeal painted a brighter picture
than what most, including Rose,
foresee.
Since the sanctions were
handed down in the fall of 2002,
the University hasn't been able to
acknowledge the Fab Five, Web-
ber or publicly display the ban-
ners. That self-imposed ban ends
thisMay.
"I know Chris even wants it,"
King said. "I think that now that
it's January 2013 ... we, internal-
ly, amongst ourselves, will start
trying to reach out ourselves. I
wouldn't be surprised in the next
couple of weeks or months to
come, that,youknow, Chris opens
up and starts to publicly acknowl-
edge the ban being over."
But Rose's response to King's
statements sounded more real-
istic, even though some believe
there's been somewhat of a rift
going on between Rose and Web-
ber. Rose admitted that Webber
had initially agreed to be a part of
