Peter Orner is afiction author and thing we call anovel.
a faculty member at the graduate
writing program at San Francisco What did you study at the
State University. University?

What piqued your interest
in writing novels?
I've always loved stories - to
read and to try to write them. I
think I may have first become
interested in writingnovels when
I read Tim O'Brien's "The Things
They Carried" in a class with
NickDelbanco at Michigan.Ilove
novels that expand the definition
of what a novel is. We also read
the great Jamaica Kincaid in that
class as well. The book was Annie
John. Kincaid too gave me a new
angle on how to structure this

At Michigan, I have to admit
I was a less than stellar student.
I was an English major with a
concentration in creative writ-
ing, which means I took a few
literature courses and about 500
creative writing courses.
In hindsight, I wish I'd stud-
ied more literature, but at the
time I loved it. I went to col-
lege and made up stories. What
could have been better? Two
Michigan professors I can
never thank enough are Tish
O'Dowd, who encouraged me
very early - I'm very grateful

for her kindness and her sense
of humor - and Charles Baxter,
who took me on as independent
study, and once wrote me a gen-
erous note, saying my sentence,
"The closet smelled like potato
chips" wasn't a bad line. I still
have the note. He wrote it on a
typewriter.
If you had to describe your
writing style in one word,
what would it be?
I try to keep things short and
essential. If I can pare some-
thing down, I will - i.e. I don't
need the second sentence here
or this one either.

Ayub said.
LSA sophomore Billy Diaz, a
member of Sexperteam, said the
panelists' research would be the
foundation of future sexual infor-

"We have to have more events
like this so people can realize how
important it is to constantly talk
about sex in all kinds of different
ways, not even just, like, educa-
tional or experience-wise," Diaz
said.
Laura McAndrew, a health
educator at UHS and the head of
Sexperteam, said she hopes peo-
ple who attend Sexpertise will
become aware of broader perspec-
tives about sexual relationships.
"Sexpertise is an opportunity
to engage in many of the other
dimensions that impact or can be
impacted by sexuality, (such as)
mental health, social identities,
ability and the media, in addition
to birth control and safer sex,"
McAndrew said.
McAndrew added that Sexper-
tise strives to create judgment-free
environments where students can
openly talk about sex and its role
as part of the human experience.

Alumni start-
up Weather
Underground
donates $500,000
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily Staff Reporter
Students with innovative
ideas may have the opportu-
nity to turn them into real-
ity thanks to a grant from an
alumni start-up.
Weather Underground a
Ann Arbor-based Weather
forecast website, has made
a $500,000 donation to the
University's Center for Entre-
preneurship to continue a
week-long educational trip for
students.
Beginning in 2008, the
Weather Underground Start-
up Trek educates students
about the technology industry
and connects them to alumni
and professionals in the Sili-
con Valley and San Francisco
Bay area.
Jeffrey Masters, director
of meteorology for Weather
Underground, graduated from
the University with a Bach-
elor of Science in 1982 and a
Masters of Science in meteo-
rology in 1983. He went on
to co-found Weather Under-
ground in 1995, and sold the
company to The Weather

Channel Companies in July
2012 for an undisclosed price.'
Andria Stark, the market-
ing assistant for Weather
Underground, said Masters
founded the website while at
the University and the compa-
ny donated the funds needed
for the trip in hopes that other
students will have similar
opportunities.
Students who have a pro-
posed idea can apply to take
part in the trek online by sub-
mitting a short video. Selected
students are given the oppor-
tunity to pitch their start-up
ideas to and receive feedback
from investors and entrepre-
neurs.
CFE Executive Director
Doug Neal said students not
only receive hands-on edu-
cational experience, but also
connect to alumni, including
major players in the technol-
ogy industry.
LSA junior Shiva Kilaru
was chosen to attend last
year's trip after winning
MPowered's Start-up Week-
end competition. He, along
with recent LSA graduate Erik
Torenberg, developed Rap
Roulette, a start-up company
that hosts cross-country rap
battles online.
Kilaru said the pair ulti-
mately won the competition
by performing instead of pre-
senting a more traditional rev-
enue model.

"Before start-up weekend,
I was pre-med, worried about
taking the MCAT. Now I'm
an informatics major," Kilaru
said.
LSA junior Dan Hoffmann,
Kinesiology junior Harri-
son Forman, and Engineer-
ing sophomore Zach Mandell
had similar experiences last
year in founding StudentKit,
an app that alerts students
to academic and professional
opportunities on their college
campus based on personal
interests.
Hoffmann said the oppor-
tunities the University offered
on the trip gave him a bet-
ter perspective of real-world
entrepreneurial ventures.
"I walked away from the
trip with an appreciation for
the vibrancy of the Michigan
entrepreneurial community
and the diversity of ventures
that are launched in dorm
rooms and labs here on cam-
pus," Hoffmann said.
The team left the trek with
a second place prize and anew
understanding of how to pres-
ent themselves to investors.
Hoffmann said practicing his
pitch to professionals was an
important part of the learning
process.
"Although it is easy to think
up seemingly novel ideas, the
pressure-testing that comes
with presenting that idea to
others is crucial."

HOUSTON
Second suspect
possibly involved
in college shooting
A second suspect may emerge
in the aftermath of the shoot-
ing at a Houston-area commu-

injured, the Harris County sher-
iff said Wednesday.
 At least 10 shots were fired
Tuesday during a dispute
between two men outside the
library at the North Harris cam-
pus of Lone Star College, Sheriff
Adrian Garcia said. Authorities
were still looking for the hand-
gun that was used.
Carlton Berry, 22, is charged
with two felony counts of aggra-
vated assault with a deadly weap-
on. Garcia offered no additional
details on the role of a possible
second suspect. He said investi-
gators were trying to determine
what caused the argument, add-
ing that the dispute was "idiocy,
stupidity."
WELLINGTON, New Zealand
Plane presumably
crashed, three on
board
A small plane carrying three
Canadians disappeared while
flying over an Antarctic moun-

Thursday was hampering a
search. .
The flight was going from a
U.S. station near the South Pole
to an Italian research base in
Terra Nova Bay. Its emergency
locator started transmitting
about 10 p.m. Wednesday in a
mountainous area about 450
kilometers (280 miles) north of
the pole.
New Zealand, U.S. and Italian
authorities are working together
to find the de Havilland Twin
Otter plane, which they presume
has crashed. It was carrying sur-
vival equipment including tents
and food, according to New Zea-
land Search and Rescue Mission
Coordinator John Ashby.

GAZA CITY
Hamas rulers
arrest six local
reporters
A Palestinian rights group
says Gaza's Hamas rulers have
detained six journalists suspect-
ed of affiliation to a rival group,
Fatah.
The Palestinian Center for
Human Rights said Wednes-
day that Hamas security forces
seized the men and their equip-
ment over the past two days.
The group said the detentions
were part of a wider arrest sweep
this week of two dozen suspect-
ed Fatah loyalists.
Hamas expelled Fatah mem-
bers in 2007 and took control
of Gaza. Fatah is headed by Pal-
estinian President Mahmoud
Abbas.
The arrests could undermine
reconciliation efforts between
WHamas and Fatah. While both
groups routinely crack down on
rivals, it's unusual for six report-
ers to be picked up in one sweep.

administration's
handling of crisis
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sec-
retary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton delivered fiery rejoin-
ders Wednesday to Republican
critics of the Obama adminis-
tration's handling of the deadly
attack on a U.S. mission in Beng-
hazi, facing off with lawmakers
who included potential 2016
presidential rivals.
At times emotional and fre-
quently combative, ' Clinton
rejected GOP suggestions in two
congressional hearings that the
administration tried to mislead
the country about the Sept. 11
attack that killed Chris Stevens,
the U.S. ambassador to Libya,
and three other Americans. She.
insisted the State Department is
moving swiftly and aggressively
to strengthen security at diplo-
matic posts worldwide.
In her last formal testimony

before Congress as America's
top diplomat - but perhaps not
her last time on the political
stage - Clinton once again took
responsibility for the depart-
ment's missteps and failures
leading up to the assault. But she
also said that requests for more
security at the diplomatic mis-
sion in Benghazi didn't reach
her desk, and reminded law-
makers that they have a respon-
sibility to fund security-related
budget requests.
Three weeks after her release
from a New York hospital -
admitted for complications
after a concussion - Clinton
was at times defiant, compli-
mentary and willing to chastise
lawmakers during more than
5 1/2 hours of testimony before
two separate committees. She
tangled with some who could
be rivals in 2016 if she decides to
seek the presidency again.
Her voice cracking at one
point, Clinton said the attack
and the aftermath were highly
personal tragedies for the fami-

lies of the victims who died -
Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone
Woods and Glen Doherty - as
well as herself.
"I stood next to President
Obama as the Marines carried
those flag-draped caskets off the
plane at Andrews. I put my arms
around the mothers and fathers,
sisters and brothers, sons and
daughters and the wives left
alone to raise their children," she
told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee at a packed hearing.
Clearly annoyed with Repub-
lican complaints about the ini-
tial explanation for the attack,
she rose to the defense of U.N.
Ambassador Susan Rice, who
was vilified for widely debunked
claims five days after the attack
that protests precipitated the
raid rather than terrorism.
Clinton said, "People were
trying in real time to get to the
best information." And she said
her own focus was on looking
ahead on howsto improve securi-
ty rather than revisiting the talk-
ing points and Rice's comments.

Pentagon opens
combat positions
not allowed before
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Pentagon is lifting its ban on
women serving in combat, open-
ing hundreds of thousands of
front-line positions and poten-
tially elite commando jobs after
generations of limits on their
service, defense officials said
Wednesday.
The changes, set to be
announced Thursday by Defense
Secretary Leon Panetta, will
not happen overnight. The ser-
vices must now develop plans
for allowing women to seek the
combat positions, a senior mili-
tary official said. Some jobs may
open as soon as this year, while
assessments for others, such
as special operations forces,
including Navy SEALS and the
Army's Delta Force, may take
longer. The services will have
until January 2016 to make
a case to that some positions
should remain closed to women.
The groundbreaking move
recommended by the Joint
Chiefs of Staff overturns a
1994 rule prohibiting women
from being assigned to smaller
ground combat units.
Officials briefed The Associ-
ated Press on the changes on
condition of anonymity so they
could speak ahead of the official
announcement.
There long has been oppo-
sition to putting women in
combat, based on questions of
whether they have the necessary
strength and stamina for certain
jobs, or whether their presence
might hurt unit cohesion.
But as news of Panetta's
expected order got out, mem-
bers of Congress, including the
Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee chairman, Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich., announced
their support.
"It reflects the reality of 21st
century military operations,"
Levin said.
Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma,
who will be the top Republican
on the Armed Services panel,
said, however, that he does not
believe this will be abroad open-
ing of combat roles for women
because there are practical bar-
riers that have to be overcome in
order to protect the safety and
privacy of all members of the
military.
Panetta's move comes in his
final weeks as Pentagon chief
and just days after President
Barack Obama's inaugural
speech in which he spoke pas-
sionately about equal rights for
all. The new order expands the
department's action of nearly a

year ago to open about 14,00
combat positions to women,
nearly all of them in the Army.
Panetta's decision could open
more than 230,000 jobs, many
in Army and Marine infantry
units, to women.
In addition to questions of
strength and performance,
there also have been suggestions
that the American public would
not tolerate large numbers of
women being killed in war.
Under the 1994 Pentagon
policy, women were prohib-
ited from being assigned to
ground combat units below
the brigade level. A brigade is
roughly 3,500 troops split into
several battalions of about 800
soldiers each. Historically, bri-
gades were based farther from
the front lines and they often
included top command and
support staff.
The necessities of combat in
Iraq and Afghanistan, however,
propelled women into jobs as
medics, military police and
intelligence officers that were
sometimes attached - but not
formally assigned - to battal-
ions. So while awoman couldn't
be assigned as an infantryman
in a battalion going out on
patrol, she could fly the heli-
copter supporting the unit, or
move in to provide medical aid
if troops were injured.
And these conflicts, where
battlefield lines are blurred
and insurgents can lurk around
every corner, have made it
almost impossible to keep
women clear of combat.
Still, as recent surveys and
experiences have shown, it
will not be an easy transition.
Whenthe Marine Corps sought
women to go through its tough
infantry course last year, two
volunteered and both failed
to complete the course. And
there may not be a wide clam-
oring from women for the more
intense, dangerous and difficult
jobs - including some infantry
and commando positions.
In the Navy, however, women
have begun moving into the
submarine force, with several
officers already beginning to
serve.
Jon Soltz, who served two
Army tours in Iraq and is the
chairman of the veterans group
VoteVets.org, said it may be dif-
ficult for the military services to
carve out exceptions to the new
rule. And while he acknowl-
edged that not all women are
interested in pursuing some of
the gritty combat jobs, "some
of them are, and when you're
looking for the best of the best
you cast a wide net. There are
women who can meet these
standards, and they have a right
to compete."

Panel pushes laws after gang rape

Indian government
urges enforcement
of sexual assault
legislation
NEW DELHI (AP) - On the
eve of a trial over a fatal gang
rape that horrified Indians, a
government panel recommend-
ed that India strictly enforce
sexual assault laws, commit to
holding speedy rape trials and
change the antiquated penal
code to protect women.
The panel, formed in response
to last month's brutal attack on a
New Delhi bus, received more
than 80,000 suggestions for a
complete overhaul in the crimi-
nal justice system's treatment
of violence against women. The
suggestions included banning a
traumatic vaginal exam of rape
victims and ending political
interference in sex crime cases.
The panel issued its findings
Wednesday. On Thursday, a trial
is set to be begin for five men
accused in the case. The case of
a sixth suspect who says he is a
juvenile is being handled sepa-
rately.

Police say the victim and a
male friend were attacked after
boarding the bus Dec. 16. The
attackers beat the man and raped
the woman, inflicting massive
internal injuries with a metal
bar, police said. The victimswere
dumped on the roadside, and the
woman died two weeks later in a
Singapore hospital.
The government set up the
panel a month ago to help quell
street protests sparked by the
rape.
Women say they feel under
siege and are so frightened they
have structured their entire
lives to protect themselves from
harassment and attack. Many
travel in groups, go out of their
homes only during the day and
carry sharp objects to stab men
who grope them on public buses.
Those who are raped are often
blamed by their families for the
attack. If they report the crime,
the police often refuse to file a
reportor try to get the victim and
attacker to reach a settlement.
If it reaches court, the case can
drag on for years in the overbur-
dened justice system.
"Failure of good governance
is the obvious root cause for the
current unsafe environment,

eroding the rule of law and not
the want of knee-jerk legisla-
tion," said retired Chief Justice
J.S. Verma, who headed the
three-member panel.
The panel recommended to
the government that police and
other officials who fail to act
against crimes against women
be punished. It called for a crack-
down on dowry payments to
enhance women's status, since
families are often forced into
massive debt to get their daugh-
ters married. It also suggested
the government appoint more
judges to lessen the backlog of
cases and ensure swift justice,
and it called for updating the law
to include crimes such as voyeur-
ism and stalking.
"We hope the Parliament will
take the legislative suggestions
given by the committee," and
translate these into law, Verma
said.
Verma advocated strict
punishment to prevent sexual
harassment and assaults against
women and sought reforms in
how police treat rape victims.
He called for speedy justice
and the settingof a time frame to
deal with cases of crimes against
women.

Gun ownership should stay public information
n Wednesday morning, a bill passed through the Michigan
Senate Judiciary Committee that would make certain guns
manufactured in the state exempt from existing federal fire-
arms regulations. In addition to eliminating some licensing require-
ments for federal firearms dealers, the package would prevent handgun
registration records from being publicly available under the Freedom
of Information Act. This measure to limit public records is considered
a response to a map published in New York newspaper The Journal
News, which listed information about registered gun owners in their
area. Despite controversy surrounding the paper's decision to publish
the map, the Michigan bill shouldn't move forward with this legisla-
tion. Michigan residents deserve to have access to these public records.

Proponents of such legislation argue that
it prevents gun owners from being unfairly
targeted by malicious or defamatory use of
this information. Although inflammatory and
controversial in light of increasing national
debate over gun laws, publishing publicly
available information about the holders of
firearms permits was within the purview of
the journalists. In an era of increasing acces-
sibility to personal information, a perceived
breach of privacy rights isn't addressed most
efficiently by reacting to this particular map.
If the journalists' actions are to be challenged
in light of this specific incident, it should be
part of a wider conversation about access to
personal information, not as justification to
promote the special interests of some.
Michigan's current laws regulating the
privacy of gun ownership information aren't
uniformly and comprehensively defined.
Although Michigan law already exempts
holders of concealed pistol permits from
being disclosed under the Freedom of Infor-
mation Act, records of purchase permits
provided by local law enforcement are still
available to the public. In lieu of a thorough
legislative process, the proposed bills are
strictly reactionary and fail to examine the

structure and motivations for gun control
laws in the state.
Firearm permits are issued to vet poten-
tial gun owners, introducing a measure of
accountability to the use of guns. Statistics
from the FBI show that nearly 67 percent of
homicides in the United States are commit-
ted with firearms. As with other products
that may pose a threat to public safety, guns
are federally and state-regulated devices.
FOIA was created to provide accountability
and transparency of legally regulated activi-
ties and to ensure that the safety, security and
rights of the public aren't outweighed by the
interests of policymakers or special interest
groups.
Michigan should uphold the example set
by federal legislation and promote public and
government accountability. The bill being
considered by the state legislature is a reac-
tionary response to an isolated incident and
doesn't address the issue at the heart of the
gun control debate.. If a conversation about
gun rights occurs at the legislative level, the
state government needs to set a precedent
that makes accountability a priority and the
disclosure of gun ownership part of the rule,
not the exception.

IAN ROBINSON AND BONNIE HALLORAN I
Protect Michigan's unions

As the University community commemo-
rates the accomplishments of Martin Luther
King Jr. this week, we should remember his
opposition to right-to-work laws, such as
the one rushed through the lame-duck ses-
sion of the Michigan legislature in Dec. 2012.
Here are King's words from a 1961 speech -
words that members of University Lecturers'
Employee Organization are posting on their
doors: "We must guard against being fooled
by false slogans, such as right-to-work. It's a
law to rob us of our civil rights and job rights.
Wherever these laws have been passed, wages
are lower, job opportunities are fewer and
there are no civil rights. We demand this
fraud be stopped."
What are right-to-work laws? Right-to-
work laws allow employees to opt out of
union dues, even though American labor law
requires collective agreements to cover all
employees in a bargaining unit. Doingso is like
letting people consume government services
and then decide whether they want to pay any
taxes. Right-to-work laws first became a legal
possibility when the federal Taft-Hartley
Act of 1947 outlawed collective agreements
requiring union membership as a condition
of getting a job, and permitted states to pass
right-to-work statutes to encourage free-rid-
ing. The earliest states to pass right-to-work
laws were all in the south, but they gradually
spread out of their regional stronghold. In
December, Michigan became the 24th state to
pass right-to-work legislation.
King understood that Taft-Hartley - and
with it, right-to-work-was motivated atleast
as much by anti-black as by anti-union ani-
mus. He knew that the collapse of organized
labor's drive to organize the south - which
was intended by Taft-Hartley - was a huge
blow, not just to unions but to the civil rights
movement as well.
Today, right-to-work is still an anti-union
and an anti-worker measure. So what is the
University, while celebrating King, doing to
reduce the negative impact of right-to-work
on working people and minorities in this
state? So far, very little. There are nine unions
at the University. On the Ann Arbor campus,
seven of these unions have a direct impact on
students: American Federation of State, Coun-
ty and Municipal Employees, Slpilled Trades,
Operating Engineers; Police Officers Asso-
ciation of Michigan; the Nurses' Union; the
Lecturers' Employee Organization; and the

Graduate Employee's Organization.
The first five unions represent employees
who are often invisible to students: the cus-
todial staff, campus mail handlers, operators
of the heating and coolingsystems, the nurses
who work in the University's health system
and campus safety officers. However, the first
four play a critical role in making the campus
function smoothly, and, of those, the police
officers and the nurses might save your life
in that rare moment of crisis. You do see the
teachers in LEO and GEO every day. Togeth-
er, we account for about half of all University
undergraduate teaching (measured as "stu-
dent credit hours").
We should ask ourselves: What can the Uni-
versity do? A lot. University administrators
can sit down with unions that represent about
half of the workers on this campus and offer
to substantially lengthen their collective bar-
gaining agreements. Michigan's right-to-work
legislation does not come into effect until late
March 2013. If the University and the unions
agree to long extensions before that deadline,
it would give the unions many years of pro-
tection against right-to-work. LEO is the first
union to negotiate a new contract under the
threat of right-to-work, and the administra-
tion could start by committing to complete
the bargaining process by early March. So far,
however, they've dragged their feet.
Last Friday, they offered a proposal that
would deny the union the ability to collec-
tive bargaining benefits. Such a proposal is
antithetical to LEO's existence as a union,
and creates a major roadblock for reaching
an agreement in time to safeguard the union
from the negative impact of right-to-work.
If you believe in King's dream, and you
understand the critical importance of revital-
izing both the civil rights and the labor move-
ment, and if that dream is to be realized, then
stand up and be counted. You can support
LEO by signing an online petition. You also
can e-mail University President Mary Sue
Coleman, University Provost Phil Hanlon and
the regents to let them know you think that
the University should stand with King and
agree to negotiate contract extensions with
all University unions before the right-to-work
law takes effect.

nglish teacher John Keating
tells his students in "Dead
Poets Society," "This is a
battle - a war
- and the casu-
alties could be
your hearts and
souls." The same
could be said for
the battle that4
many college
students endure
as they struggle MICHAEL
to figure out SPAETH
where their lives
are headed.
On one side, we have the idealists.
They're the doe-eyed optimists who
are absolutely convinced that they'll
change the world for the better. They
follow the advice of older adults who
urge college students to do what they
love in life no matter what negative
consequences result from that deci-
sion. They aren't concerned about
money and are certain that every-
thing will work out in the end.
On the other side, we have the
cynics. They've become hardened
after enduring many disappoint-
ments over the years. They listen
to older adults and pundits who
continuously reinforce the notion
that some things cannot be done or
that other things "just don't work
that way." They claim to know what
"reality" is and relentlessly mock
idealists as naive people who just
don't understand the "real world."
Although we may fluctuate from
time to time, we usually identify
with one side or the other. We rare-
ly consider the possibility that there
might be a fertile middle ground
between these two sides. In this
middle ground, we have the prac-
tical optimists. They're the people
who set their sights on an end goal,
however improbable it may be, and

stubbornly pursue that goal until
they succeed - while also remain-
ing keenly aware of the realities of
the environment in which they're
working.
Many of the great figures in our
history have been practical opti-
mists. For example, Steven Spiel-
berg's latest film "Lincoln" shows
how the 16th president managed to
gather enough votes to get the 13th
Amendment passed, despite howls
of protest from the cynics around
him. Lincoln was absolutely com-
mitted to the lofty ideal of abolish-
ing slavery forever, but he had the
political acumen to figure out how
to actually get it done.
It's understandable that many
college students are cynical these
days, particularly in an incredibly
polarized political environment
and with uncertain job prospects in
the aftermath of the Great Reces-
sion. In August, a student writ-
ing for The Rice Standard at Rice
University praised cynicism: "It
takes courage to accept things for
the way they are, however bad (or
even good) they might be. Cynically
accepting things for the way they
are is perhaps the only way to truly
appreciate them."
I don't dispute the idea that we
should accept things for the way
they are, but I firmly reject the
notion that this acceptance must
last forever. The current realities of
the world can't be the end point -
they have to be the starting point.
We need a very clear understanding
of how things are so we can intel-
ligently figure out what concrete
actions to take so we can change
the world for the better. This is how
we become practical optimists. The
question isn't whether we can cre-
ate positive changes in the world.
Instead, the question is how we cre-

ate those changes.
It's easy to mock idealism, but
while the realities of the world will
bruise many idealists, cynicism is
completely self-destructive. If we
instantly dismiss something that
could improve society for the better
as "unrealistic," then we're conced-
ing defeat before we've even fought
the battle in the first place. That
isn't courage at all.
It's easy to mock
idealism, but
cynicism is
self-destructive.
Reality might limit our options
right now, but we can at least get
started in making our vision for a
better world a reality. Or better yet,
we can think of innovative options
that no one else has considered,
which could change the status quo
altogether. We are a new generation
that grew up with the Internet. We
are more accepting of diversity than
past generations and have tremen-
dous potential. Surely we can come
up with something that will change
the world for the better - even if
that change isn't instantaneous.
We have to try every option at
our disposal. As President Franklin
Roosevelt once said, "It is common
sense to take a method and try it.
If it fails, admit it frankly and try
another. But above all, try some-
thing." We can't stop until we suc-
ceed. And we can't let the cynics get
in our way.

in conducting from the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma.
Pasquale said he didn't expect
a promotion, which was first pri-
vately discussed about two weeks
ago after the Outback Bowl.
"I was shocked, I was in awe,
and I was exhilarated," Pasquale
said. "(It is) such an exciting
piece of information; I'll tell you
- I was just thrilled."
Pasquale added that because
he is close friends with Boerma,
the change in leadership should
be a "seamless" transition. He
does not intend on making any
real changes to the way the
band performs, which he said is
already quite respectable.
"The performance standards
are so high and the tradition and
legacy are so great," Pasquale
said. "I just hope that I can main-
taiA those while trying to incor-
porate a couple things that will
keep us current and modern."
Pasquale said he will con-
sider input from band members,
donors and the Athletic Depart-
ment as he takes his new post.
"In the past five years I have
relied heavily on the feedback
and guidance of our students ...
for their creative ideas and cre-
ative outlets," Pasquale said.
"The students here are smarter
than any I've encountered any-
where. The talent level on this
campus - the work ethic, drive,
and professionalism - sets all
kinds of standards. There is no
better place on earth, I truly
believe that. I am so excited to be
able to stay at a place I love."
PROVOST
From Page 1A
MT&D sophomore Gabrielle
Lewis, a board member on the
assembly, said the event marked
the first time any provost at the
University has visited and dis-
cussed these issues with the stu-
dents of the school.
Lewis said she hopes the stu-
dent government will allow oth-
ers to feel more confident and
willing to collaborate within the
University.
The talk with Hanlon and Vice
Provost Martha Pollack was also
the first event ever hosted by the
assembly. Jonathan Hulting-
Cohen, an MT&D graduate stu-
,dent and president of the CSA,
said the creation of the assembly
served as a reason to hold the
event.
"One of the main purposes of
the group is to connect students
and their ideas with the admin-
istration so that they could help,"
said Hulting-Cohen.
The new assembly hopes to
create more collaboration among
students within the school and
also with the University, he said.
It is composed of students repre-
senting each deportment in the
school and was created by Melo-
dy Racine, the school's associate
dean for academic affairs.
Hanlon and Pollack gave a
PowerPoint presentation out-
lining the priorities, pressures
and responsibilities the Univer-
sity faces regarding the budget.
Hanlon primarily spoke of the
University's strive for academic

excellence, access and afford-
ability for students in addition to
budget constraint.
"I know all of you are con-

LSA sophomore Jacob Swan-
son, a trumpet player, said the
marching band members in
attendance at a meeting Wednes-
day burst into applause after
Haithcock announced the new
band director. Swanson added
that Pasquale was "the perfect
choice" for the position.
"The fact that he was the assis-
tant director of bands makes it a
really natural and smooth transi-
tion because he had Dr. Boerma
to help him along with the tran-
sition," Swanson said. "He knows
the tradition of the marching
band, and I think he has a lot of
great ideas in store for making
it innovative and bringing new
qualities to the band to add on to
its already great legacy."
LSA freshman Matt Cloutier,
also a trumpet player, said he
wasn't surprised to hear Pasquale
was named director.
"He is incredible leader and
really does a good job with con-
necting with the kids," Cloutier
said.
Engineering sophomore
Elayne Thomas, a piccolo player,
said Pasquale will bring "a new
outlook" to the band. She added
that his previous experience gives
him insight into "how the band
runs and what motivates us."
"I knew that he would defi-
nitely make a great band direc-
tor and he would instantly adjust
to the position," Thomas said. "I
think he has more attention to
the details of music - more than
Dr. Boerma did - so I think that
will overall increase our sound
out on the field and when we're
sitting."
Pasquale will assume the new
position June 1.
to wages dropping, family size
increasing and decline in state
appropriations for public univer-
sities.
In 1960, the University
received S0 percent of its money
from the state; currently it
receives 17 percent, Hanlon said.
Hanlon added that the Univer-
sity has been making efforts to
aid this problem by prioritizing
certain efforts in building reno-
vations and lowering expenses
per year by $235 million.
"The School of Music, The-
atre & Dance is one of the gems
on this campus," Hanlon added.
"You guys are remarkably tal-
ented and you have an incredibly
creative energy to the c'ulture on
this campus."
MT&D sophomore Ji Hoon
Kang said he attended the event
to learn about information that
is not at the forefront of his con-
cerns.
"I think (the budget) is very
important to cover just because it
raises a lot questions," Kang said.
"I'm very glad that I went."
However, MT&D sophomore
Elizabeth Raynes and MT&D
junior Elizabeth Williams said
they were disappointed with the
information presented at the
event.
"It was frustrating because
this was supposed to be for
MT&D, and all of the figures that
he gave us were very general and
based on the entire (University),"
Williams said. "I understand
that we're not the largest and
we're not the most expensive,
but I just didn't really feel like he
was trying to cater to us."

Raynes, an out-of-state student
who works a full-time job while
taking classes, asked Hanlon
about merit-based scholarships
for students in the school. She
was told to talk to someone in the
school's department.

Katherine White was the only

"We're very interested in
issues related to the future of
education, particularly public
higher education - the chal-
lenges, the opportunities - and
we have an opportunity in meet-
ing out there," Coleman said in
December. "They all have a per-
spective that is very interesting.
There is no way I could get those
people to come out here."
California is perhaps the epi-
center of the struggles facing
higher education. Over the last
decade, the University of Cali-
fornia system has faced' enor-
mous decreases in state support.
According to UC spokeswoman
Dianne Klein, the state of Cali-
fornia contributed only 37 per-
cent of the cost of educating a
student for the current school
year.
While the specific topics dis-
cussed were not made public,
Birgeneau said his time with the
regents and executive officers
covered topics such as prospects
for public universities across
the country, budget challenges,
streamlining administration
costs, competition for the best
faculty and financial aid for

Birgeneau said Berkeley has
worked to combine its purchas-
ing with the University of Cali-
fornia, San Francisco in order
to save money on large orders,
among other administrative cost
changes. Overall, Birgeneau said
a "pessimistic" estimate was sav-
ings of $70 million per year as a
result cost-savings programs.
The issue of declining fed-
eral support for research fund-
ing was also a primary focus of
conversation. Birgeneau added
that he was "optimistic" about
the future of research fund-
ing in light of President Barack
Obama's inaugural address. Pri-
vate partnerships with industry
and foundations could also pro-
vide a new source of revenue,
albeit one much smaller than the
support that the federal govern-
ment gives for basic research.
"Federal money is important,
but we get a lot of money from
different foundations," Birge-
neau said. "I would say we are
trying to diversify our research
base in the same way we diver-
sify everything else."
The regents also met with Rus-
sell, who is leading the Google's
foray into "massive open online
courses." At the Sept. meeting of
the Board of Regents, some mem-
bers expressed hesitation about
the University of Michigan being
involved in Coursera, a MOOC
provider.
The University does not cur-
rently charge for the online
courses it provides, but Vice
Provost Martha Pollack told the
mittee include Chemistry Prof.
Mark Banaszak-Holl and Busi-
ness Prof. Kathleen Sutcliffe.
Lisa Connolly, project manag-
er in the Office of the President,
will act as Coleman's liaison to
the search.
University spokesperson Rick
Fitzgerald said the application
review process will begin imme-
diately on a rolling basis.
"They are going to move as
quickly as possible, but it's just
more important to pick the right
person than to stick with a strict
time frame," Fitzgerald said.
Fitzgerald said search com-
mittee members were selected
to represent the community-at-
large that will be affected by cam-

regents that instituting a fee ser-
vice for continuing education
and professional development
programs was an option for the
future.
Birgeneau said Berkeley's
main priority with MOOCs cen-
tered on providing "technol-
ogy-assisted education" to its
on-campus population as well
as some offerings for the general
public.
"We're doing this to improve
education, not to make money,"
Birgeneau said.
The regents also discussed
how to handle a presidential
transition. Coleman is set to
retire in 2014 and a search for
her replacement will likely begin
this year.
Birgeneau, who is set to step
down in'the middle of 2013, said
the charge of a public university
president is to assemble a compe-
tent leadership team, have solidi-
fied personal values, withstand
"buffeting" from state politics
and media and fundraise effec-
tively.
"I'm a strong believer in the
'no-jerk' policy," Birgeneau said.
Regent Julia Darlow (D-Ann
Arbor) noted that the sessions
with Birgeneau and others made
her appreciative of the Univer-
sity's efforts to contain costs. She
added that careful planning over
the last decade has positioned the
University's finances in a good
place.
"We've been timely in looking
at cost containment and making
some very significant changes
over several years now," Darlow
pus safety and security.
"They represent a broad spec-
trum of the University com-
munity as well as the broader
.community because this posi-
tion also would interact with
the broader community, so it's
a blend," Fitzgerald said. "It's a
little bit different from most of
the search committees which
include members of the cam-
pus community but this one is
broader than that because of that
reason."
The Spelman & Johnson
Group, an executive search firm,
will assist the search committee
in suggesting possible candidates
for the office. Fitzgerald said the
group is looking for candidates

said. "It's contributed tremen-
dously to the stability that we
have right now (and) in contrast
to what California has gone
through, we can be very proud
of what the University has right
now."
Birgeneau also spoke to the
regents about programs that Cal-
ifornia sponsors to defray costs
of attendance for lower- and mid-
dle-income students. California
currently pays the entire tuition
cost for a student whose family
makes a combined income of less
than $80,000 per year and quali-
fies for financial aid.
Darlowsaidshe wasimpressed
by the support that California
provides, but she believes the
University of Michigan is com-
petitive in the amount of finan-
cial aid it awards.
"My commitment here is to
the reduction to net tuition cost
- and I stress the word 'net' -
cost for middle and lower income
students," Darlow said.
In the University's 'Record
Update, Board of Regents Chair-
man Laurence Deitch (D-Bloom-
field Hills) saidthe meetings with
donors in California were impor-
tant to building long-standing
relationships with the University.
California has the largest alumni
population of any state outside of
Michigan and is the second-high-
est donor state.
"Our meetings with donors
are critically important to the
future of the university," Deitch
said. "There's a great deal of sup-
port here in southern California

Gerald was so "disgusted" that
he walked into Harry Kripke's

Mental health funding
may increase in states

A Jordanian woman casts her ballot at a polling station in Amman, Jordan, Wednesday. The nations monarchy has tooted
Wednesday's parliamentary election as a watershed in the kingdom's democratization.
Jordan election results in a
more powerful parliment

New legislature
to choose prime
minister to split
powers with king
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) - Jor-
danians voted Wednesday for a
parliament with wider author-
ity, as the king cedes some of his
powers to try to prevent simmer-
ing dissent from boiling over into
a full blown Arab Spring uprising.
The new legislature will choose
the prime minister and run day-
to-day affairs, powers that used to
reside with King Abdullah II. For-
eign policy and security matters
remain in the hands of the king.
Abdullah has introduced the
reforms in a measured manner,
trying to manage the pace of
change.
Critics charge that the reforms
are too mild and the election is
not enough of a change. The main
opposition group, the Muslim
Brotherhood, boycotted the vot-
ing.
The 2011 Arab Spring upris-
ings in the region set off a wave
of demonstrations in this usually
placid U.S. ally. They have includ-
ed unprecedented calls for the

king to step down, raising alarms
about the depth of the unrest.
The protests in Jordan have
not been on the scale of the upris-
ings that toppled leaders in Egypt,
Libya, Yemen and Tunisia, or the
bloody civil war in neighboring
Syria.
Nearly 300,000 Syrian refu-
gees have fled to Jordan, some
suspected of links to the Syrian
regime. Some in Jordan worry
that they could be a destabilizing
element.
At a polling station at an
Amman highschool, Islam Qandil,
29, wearing an Islamic niqab cov-
ering her whole face except her
eyes, said she didn't agree with
the opposition boycott. The oppo-
sition has "the right to express
their views, but the rule in Jordan
is fair," she said, expressing trust
in the king.
Outside another polling station
across town, convenience store
clerk Mohammed Abu-Summaqa,
21, said he would not cast a ballot.
"Members of parliament will
not be able to do anything for us
because they are controlled by the
king and Cabinet, so why should I
vote?" he asked.
Because of the Brotherhood's
absence, the next parliament is
likely to be a mix of independents

with little political experience
and pro-king conservatives, as
previous ones were.
Nearly 1,500 candidates,
including 191 women, ran for the
150-seat parliament. Woman have
15 seats reserved for them under a
quota, and Christians, who make
up 4 percent of the country's 6
million population, will get at
least nine.
Polling stations stayed open for
an extra hour to accommodate
late voters. Independent Electoral
Commission spokesman Hus-
sein Bani Hani said turnout was
about 56.5 percent of Jordan's 2.3
million registered voters, slight-
ly more than the last election
in 2010. Unofficial results were
expected on Thursday.
The Brotherhood and four
other smaller parties, mainly
Communists and Arab national-
ists, stayed away to protest an
election law they see as biased
in favor of Abdullah's loyalists.
The government countered that
the Islamists' alternative would
inflate their representation.
"Today was a comedy," said
Zaki Bani Irsheid, a leader of the
Islamic Action Front, the Broth-
erhood's political arm. "How can
you have elections without the
opposition?"

"We've been unable to main-

said Bill Lindsey, director of
South Carolina's National Asso-
ciation on Mental Illness.
During former Gov. Mark
Sanford's term, the fiscal pres-
sure was inescapable. The
recession cut state revenue by
more than $I billion from 2008
to 201L
"It wasn't really Sanford's
fault," said former state Rep.
Dan Cooper, Republican chair-
man of the House Ways and
Means Committee. "There ust
wasn't enough money to go

Revenues have since recov-
ered somewhat, and are pro-
jected to be at levels last seen in
2008.
In Kansas, under then-Gov.
Kathleen Sebelius, a Demo-
crat, state psychiatric hospitals
began treating only the most
dangerous cases. Caseloads, at
the Johnson County Mental
Health Center near Kansas City
rose from the recommended 15
per caseworker to more than 30
in 2010.
Tim DeWeese, the center's
clinical director, said one of
his patients who had finished
college and gotten a job and an
apartment became homeless
after his doctor visits were cut
off.
"It came crashing down all
the way," DeWeese said.
Oklahoma also cut men-
tal health programs in 2010
and 2011. But Republican Gov.
Mary Fallin, a conservative
elected in the GOP landslide
of 2010 on a promise to cut
spending, reversed course last
year after grim warnings about
the effect on public safety, and
after several teen suicides in
Oklahoma City.
"There just weren't enough
resources," said Harry Tyler,
director of the Mental Health
Association of Central Okla-
homa.
Fallin approved a 20 per-
cent budget increase and has
pledged to make mental health
a priority again this year.

Junior Luke Moffatt, senior
Jeff Rohrkemper and sopho-
more Andrew Sinelli - three
Michigan hockey players that
haven't exactly been household
names this season.
Moffatt, Rohrkemper, and
Sinelli, who have played on dif-
ferent lines, or sometimes not
even at all, comprised the Wol-
verines' fourth line during their
series split with Lake Superior
State this past weekend.
Traditionally, the fourth line
is not often called upon to pro-
duce a lot of points - it's usu-
ally made up of some of the more
unsung players on the team.
Which is why when the line fin-
ished this past weekend with
a combined two goals and four
assists, it was a pleasant sur-
prise for a Michigan team that
came in with a four-game losing
streak and an offense that had
scored just nine goals during
that span.
In the Wolverines' 6-4 vic-
tory over the Lakers on Friday
night, Moffatt tallied his sec-
ond and third goals of the year,
both coming off of assists from
Sinelli, and a secondary assist
from Rohrkemper. With a goal
against Bowling Green on Jan. 8,
Moffatt, who had failed to tally
a goal all season, now has three.
"I was having a tough start
production-wise this season - a
little snake bitten," he said. "Not
that I wasn't playing well, but
pucks weren't bouncing for me
and going in."
Michigan coach Red Beren-
sqn has frequently switched
up the lines this season in an
attempt to get the offense out of
scoring droughts. Considering
that Moffatt played with both
Sinelli and Rohrkemper on a
line for some of last season, this
familiarity proved useful.
Having played on every line
this year at some point or anoth-
er, Moffatt has experienced the
ups and downs that come with

different linemates. Butthis ver-
satility also enables him to bet-
ter understand how important
production from the lower lines
can be.
"When you're not on the
fourth line and they put up some
points or do anything good out
there, it's just great energy to the
team," Moffatt said. "The guys
feed off the fourth-line energy
even more than the first or sec-
ond."
Despite Moffatt leading the
score sheet against Lake Supe-
rior State, Sinelli had an equal-
ly impressive weekend. He'd
appeared in just seven games
this season and his two assists
on Friday doubled his season
point total - one goal. Berenson
said that if he keeps playing like
he did against Lake Superior
State, "he'll play a lot."
Despite Berenson's constant
shifting of the lines, he knows
not to tinker with something
that's working. Rohrkemper,
who was called on earlier in
the year to play defense due to
a depleted defensive corps, has
also seen time with different

lines this season.
"If the line is playing well,
that's the main thing," Berenson
said. "You hate to take a player
that's playing well and put him
on another line that's not play-
ing well. You're not sure if you're
going to get a win-win or a lose-
lose, so maybe you're better off
keeping them the way they are."
When Michigan has lost this
season, the next weekend's line-
up was never a certainty. And
even after the split, it's almost
a certainty that Moffatt, Sinelli
and Rohrkemper will all find
themselves playing some role
for Michigan when it travels this
weekend to play No. 9 Western
Michigan.
The Broncos' 1.88 goals
allowed per game is the CCHA's
second-best defense, and if the
Wolverines hope to have any
offensive success, the lower-tier
lines providing an extra-offen-
sive boost might be just what the
doctor.ordered for Michigan to
make a late-season push.
But Berenson knows that the
Wolverines' struggles won't
all be fixed by a couple of goals

from a lower line - offensive
and defensive production will
ultimately be the result of a col-
lective team effort.
"The fourth line is a good
start," Berenson said. "We've
got two or three others lines that
can pick up the slack....We need
production from anyone."

Redshirt junior centerJordan Morgan said the short break between games provided time to get back to fundamentals.
For nation'slikely N.1,

By STEVEN BRAID
Daily Sports Editor
The extended break couldn't
have come at a better time for the
No. 2 Michigan men's basketball
team.
With seven days to prepare
for Thursday's contest against
Purdue (3-2 Big Ten, 10-8 over-
all), the Wolverines utilized the
opportunity to get back to the
basics.
"Wejusttook

kind of gets lost
in the shuffle of
guarding all these offenses that
different teams run."
Sandwiched in between a road
swing against two top-15 oppo-
nents and a stretch that includes
four games in 10 days, the Wol-
verines (4-1, 17-1) welcomed the
layoff with open arms.
"When you have the games
during the season, if you play two
games a week, it's really hard to
get back to basics because you're
always trying to rest after one
game and trying to get ready for
the next game," said Michigan
coach John Beilein. "We had to
get back to basics.

"There's scouting reports, and
then there's just the fundamen-
tals. Sometimes you get so much
into scouting reports that you're
playing to play instead of playing
basketball."
Michigan will hope to be a
much more sound team against
the Boilermakers than it was in
its previous contest. In the Wol-
verines' last outing, an 83-75 vic-
tory against Minnesota last week,
they were uncharacteristically
shaky on defense. They commit-
ted 19 total fouls - seven more
than they average per game -
and allowed the Golden Gophers
to knock down 8-of-16 shots from
downtown.
Junior swingman'Tim Hard-
away Jr. will look to continue
his hot shooting. The reigning
Big Ten Player of the Week tal-
lied 21 points on 7-of-8 shooting,
breaking out of a two-game mini-
slump in which he connected on
just 35 percent of his attempts.
Though Purdue struggled at
the beginning of the season, los-
ing six of its first 10 games, the
Boilermakersave reignited as of
late. Purdue has taken advantage
of a weak portion of its schedule
and is currently riding a three-
game winning streak, coming
off a 79-52 win against West Vir-
ginia. Led by a staunch defense,
Purdue's effectiveness will hinge
on its ability to limit easy scor-
ing opportunities by Michigan's
high-scoring attack.
Purdue center A.J. Hammons,
who ranks first in the Big Ten in
blocks (2.1) and leads all confer-
ence freshmen in rebounds (6.3),

anchors one of the best defenses
in the conference. The Boiler-
makers allow just over 60 points
a game, hounding opponents into
shooting worse than 40 percent
from the field. They will have
their hands full with the Wolver-
ines, though, who shoot 51 per-
cent from the floor - fourth-best
in the nation - and 41 percent
from beyond the arc.
"Purdue has played us tough
over the years since (I've) been
here," Beilein said. "Their
defense - they're physical."
Purdue will depend heavily
on its defense because its offense
won't offer much support. The
Boilermakers have struggled
shooting the ball from every-
where on the floor thus far this
season, connecting on just 42 per-
cent of their field-goal attempts,
32 percent of their 3-pointers,
and 63 percent of their free
throws. Guard Terone Johnson
leads all scorers with 13.3 points
per game while also acting as one
of the team's primary playmak-
ers, dishing 3.1 assists a game.
Despite losing to Purdue at
home last season on senior night
- a game in which Johnson led
the Boilermakers with 22 points
- the Wolverines are not think-
ing about the past. Their sole
focus is on the future.
"We haven't really put that
much thought into it, it's more
about this game right now and
what it does for us now," Morgan
said. "We definitely can't over-
look them because they're a very
good team."

The No. 23 Michigan wom-
en's basketball team will look
to bounce back on Thursday
when it takes on Indiana (1-4
Big Ten, 10-8 overall). Coming
off a 10-point loss to Penn State
on Monday, which snapped a
program-best 10-game winning
streak and four-game winning
streak in Big Ten play, the Wol-
verines will seek to start anew
against the Hoosiers.
Despite an all-time losing
record against Indiana, the Wol-
verines (4-1, 15-3) have won the
last five matchups, including a
65-48 victory just three weeks
ago. Michigan was led by senior
guard Jenny Ryan, who nearly
recorded a triple-double with

rebounds.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
Behind Enemy Lines:
Purdue guard D.J. Boyd

By COLLEEN THOMAS,
Daily SportsEditor
Last season, the Michigan
men's basketball team was one
home win away from complet-
ing an undefeated home record
and sending then-senior guards
Stu Douglass and Zack Novak out
with a win on senior night.
But the Wolverines' perfect
night was spoiled by Purdue and
their senior star Robbie Hum-
mel, as the Boilermakers won the
game, 75-61.
With Hummel's leadership
experience gone and an incom-
ing class of talented freshmen
- including Indiana natives A.J.
Hammons and Ronnie Johnson,
who currently are two of Purdue's
top four scorers - Purdue turned
to senior guard D.J. Byrd to lead
the young squad in what many
have perceived as a rebuilding
year for the Boilermakers.
The Daily got the chance to
talk to the senior captain at Big
Ten Media Day in October.
The Michigan Daily:What are
the big challenges as a freshman
coming into college basketball?
D.J. Byrd: First of all, there's
the physical toll of practice every
day. It's three hours a day, along
with weights. You may not neces-
sarily get a lot of sleep every night,
you have class, you have tutors,
you have a lot of stuff on your
plate as a freshman. So taking
care of all that and having to limit
your distractions is very impor-
tant. Our freshmen have done a

good job of handling itso far, and
hopefully they can improve every
day.
TMD: You had to play a lot
when you were a true freshman,
were there ever any moments
where it was a little bit over-
whelming? Any particular phase
of basketball that was difficult?
DB: Well the main thing was
just managing your time, being
able to get getting certain things
done, whether you have to study
for an exam, practice, then you
had to go to dinner - you get to
be a good planner. Luckily I had
some good guys ahead of me,
Chris Kramer as a senior, Keaton
Grant, Rob Hummel that helped
me out. That's what me and the
older guys have been doing, just
trying to help those guys any way
we can.
TMD:Your freshmen are obvi-
ously important this year, so what
kind of things are the upperclass-
men doing to help get them accli-
mated?
DB:You knowyou got coaches
telling you so many things during
practice, yelling at you, helping
you, but I'm just being another
guy that they can come ask about
a play, something off the court -
just being there and being open
to whatever they have. I think
is important just to have that
between the coaching staff and
(ourselves).
TMD: Is this group of fresh-
men wired to handle this stuff
right away?
DB: Yeah, they've grown a lot

in the past couple weeks. They've
really gotten to where they plan
ahead now. They had some expe-
rience in the summer - they got
to do some classes on campus -
but now with the season going
on, it's going to be pretty busy.
They've done a good job so far,
and they're getting better, both on
and off the court, and that's what
we need.
TMD: You've had a couple of
good senior classes in the past,
but what's going make this year's
senior class different?
DB: Me and Dru (Anthrop) are
a little different, but it's all about
helping the younger guys right
now. Last year with Robbie Hum-
mel, you have All-American type
guys graduating, and thisyear it's
trying to help the younger guys
get to where they need to be. For
me, I've learned from those guys
in the past - JaJuan Johnson,
E'Twaun Moore, Kramer - and
I've kind of learned a little bit
from each in terms of knowing
how to handle the team and how
to help everyone on the team
work to a certain degree every
day. It can be hard on a young per-
son, soI try to be a leader.
TMD: How would you define
your leadership role to the fresh-
men?
DB: It's not just the freshmen,
it's the whole team. But the fresh-
men coming in, it's the most dif-
ficult for them. I try to be a coach
on the floor, either by example or
vocally, and be that guy they can
come talk to.

COMMUNITY CULTURE COLUMN
Ann Arbors
cinematic
culture lives on

a-

"I never practiced, I was just
getting along at the barely com-
petent level, but then something
happened and I just had to play,"
said Evan Chambers, a professor
in the School of Music, Theatre
& Dance.
Though his parents were '50s
folk-music revivalists - both
sang and played a myriad of
instruments - it wasn't until
his junior year in high school
that Chambers became obsessed
with music, a moment he likens
to beingstruck by lightening.
Years later, his composition-
al pieces are being performed
across the country, including in
Carnegie Hall. But for Cham-
bers, now the Chair of Composi-
tion in MT&D, one moment from
college sticks out more than any
prestigious venue.
"I was in an orchestration

class in college, and so I did a
project and (the orchestra) read
it," he explained. "I was sitting
in the back of the hall in Bowling
Green, Ohio and it was like hav-
ing the biggest, fastest car in the
world. It was thrilling! And boy,
I was hooked at that point."
Never one to stop exploring,
Chambers's music is recognized
by critics and avid listeners alike
for its wide incorporation of
musical and artistic disciplines.
"I'm very interested, in my
work, in creating translations
between different kinds of
experiences," said Chambers,
whose pieces have incorporated
orchestras, choirs, Irish fiddles
and electronic music. "For exam-
ple, between Albanian music and
contemporary classical music.
Some of my work is even inspired
by Sufi Qawwali music."
Chambers is also an accom-
plished Irish fiddler. Around 20
years ago, he said, he was driving
to Cleveland to see his future wife
when something incredible hap-
pened.
"I was driving past Toledo and
the snow was falling down and
'The Thistle and Shamrock,' that
local folk and Celtic-music radio
show, came on and I was just
floored. It was like a conversion
experience," he explained. "It was
something that had been closed-
off and openedback up."
Though he could surely find
success as a freelance musician,

Chambers is a professor, composer, Irish fiddler and environmental activist.

Chambers is more than happy to
be a professor.
"I'm socommitted to teaching,
in fact I love it," he said. "I've had
the benefit of so many wonderful,
gifted, caring and inspired teach-
ers in my life.... It's a natural pro-
gression to want to try to emulate
them in my own way."
In addition to being a compos-
er, an Irish fiddler and a teach-
er, Chambers is an ardent and
knowledgeable environmental-
ist. With the help of the Graham
Institute, he led the success-
ful movement to eliminate the
application of chemicals to the
grass surrounding the School of
MT&D.
Unsurprisingly, Professor
Chambers's connection to the
environment has found its way
into his work.

"You're most alive when you're
in the living world, not the built
world,"he said. "There's an urgen-
cy to take that sensibility and kind
of experience and translate it into
music as well. There's also an
urgency to use your 10 minutes of
face time as a composer ... to bring
(the audience's) attention to some-
thing that's of desperate urgency
- which is the fact that we are
destroying the environment we
need to live in."
"There's a danger for artists to
be caught in the trap of wanting to
say, 'Hey, dig me' all the time," he
added. "I think my role as an artist
is much more to say, 'Hey, look at
this world, look outside - look at
the things that are larger than us
as humans and get into tune with
them."'
-JACKSON HOWARD

At a career fair hosted
by the History Depart-
ment, I talked about Ann
Arbor's film culture with one of
the alumni the department had
brought in.
Apparently,
it was once
possible to
purchase
tickets that
could be used
to attend a ,
variety of JOHN
films playing BOHN
throughout
campus - in
auditoriums
and rooms in any University
building imaginable.
No one would doubt that cin-
ema, as a cultural experience, has
been a rather big deal in the Ann
Arbor area for some time. This
past year alone, we've brought to
town national and global firsts
like the Japanese and Korean
Film Festivals, respectively.
If you've read Jacob Axelrad's
article on the history of Hash
Bash, you'll know that Andy War-
hol had shown material at one of
the many film festivals that have
occurred in Ann Arbor over the
past 60 years.
However, cinema, like all art
forms, is in constant flux; the
forms it takes as an experience
are constantly changing. Even
the communal experience the
alumni related probably became
superfluous oruntenable with
the advent ofVHS and, later on,
with the Internet.
Yet, even as things change
in Ann Arbor, old forms persist
in a big way. While most of the
world may have watched a near-
complete overhaul of the cin-
ematic landscape, in Ann Arbor,
older technologies, methods and
moods like the Barton Organ or
the old-time '20s architecture
of the Michigan Theater, exist
beside new developments.
I would like to relate one
particular experience I had at
the Michigan Theater, where
I was reminded of this chang-
ing cinematic landscape. I saw
"Nosferatu" one year during
the Halloween season. This has
become a tradition in the area
and an event I definitely suggest
everyone check out at least once
while they are here.
As it was originally per-
formed, a live organist plays a
score of the movie. The difficul-
ty of syncing up the score with
the movie in real time, espe-
cially when some of the music
functions as sound effects, is
something I cannot fathom,
but is undoubtedly something
I respect. I became anxious, as
I usually do during live perfor-
mances, and it gave an edge to a
movie that was once very scary
for its contemporary audience.
In fact, during one of the more

"scary" scenes, a sweet old lady
next to me gasped in horror at
the sight of the monstrous Nos-
feratu.
I was confronted, during
her short-but-profound gasp,
with the generational gap in
cinema. What is laughable to
the modern audience, subject
to the most obscene horrors
during even a casual film view-
ing, might be the most sublime
depths of past generations. To
discuss it ina class was one
thing, but witnessing it was
something else.
Fast-forward a year and I'm
watching "The Avengers" at
Ann Arbor's Quality 16. The
experience seems unimaginably
different. After the movie, as
I'm in the bleached tiled bath-
room, I hear a couple of kids
talking about it.
"Man, that was like living the
dream," one said.
Movie magic is
all around us.
While I was originally per-
plexed that watching a movie
could be "the dream," maybe
it was possible: a decent film
adaptation of iconic comic
culture, Robert Downey Jr.'s
particular brand of humor
andenough CGI destruction
to satisfy the most extreme of
Freudian aggressions. But it is
definitely a particular dream,
one of the current moment.
Before the "talkie" revolution,
the "dream" was probably just
hearing the human voice.
Given the rarity of such an
experience as "Nosferatu," it's
not hard to see that cinema
culture is ingrained in the Ann
Arbor community. The space has
been invested with an eye toward
film; it is, in many ways, part of
the city's landscape. With recent
updates - like the Askwith
Media Library, where, freshman
year, I attempted the impossible
feat of getting my tuition's worth
through free rentals - there does
appear to be further investment.
And yet, I won't be quick to
rest easy about the persistence of
the old experiences. Updates on
the Barton Organ have required a
great deal of passion and invest-
ment on behalf of the people and,
for a short time, the organ fell
into disarray.
Come what may, the precious-
ness and vulnerability of the
unique experiences offeredby
Ann Arbor's film culture are
apparent, and I encourage them
to always be encountered as such.

Soaring, symphonic instru-
mentals punctuated by some of
the world's most talented, clas-
sically trained vocalists fill a
concert hall. This isn't the proto-
typical image of a mariachi per-
formance, but it's what Mariachi
Vargas de Tecalitlin has been
delivering for 115 years, earning
them the title, "The Best Mariachi
Band in the World." On Jan. 27,
University Musical Society will
present Mariachi Vargas at Hill
Auditorium, two years after an
incredibly popular 2010 perfor-
mance in Ann Arbor.
Mariachi Vargas was born in
1897 in the small city of Tecalit-
ldn, which is nestled in Southern
Jalisco. It was one of the first
ensembles playing what is recog-
nized as modern mariachi and has
evolved through five generations.
Mariachi music was initially a
type of Mexican folk music, dat-
ing back to the 1860s. Mariachi
Vargas is credited for advancing
mariachi as an art form and for
setting the standard for all other
bands in the genre. Famed Mexi-
can composer Ruben Fuentes has
been responsible for the band's
artistic direction since the 1950s.
Mariachi Vargas was originally
composed of four elements: a gui-
tar, two violins and a harp. Fuentes
added a bass guitar, or a guitarr6n,
and a trumpet, creating a stronger
sound. This led former Mexican
President Adolfo Lopez Mateos to
coin the phrase, "El Mejor Maria-
chi del Mundo" in the band's third
generation. Two generations later,
 Mariachi Vargas is still recognized
as one of the greatest mariachi
bands in existence.
Cynthia Mufioz represents
Mariachi Vargas in the United
States, but her story with the
band began when she was a mid-
dle school student, completely
infatuated with mariachi music.
In 1979, Munoz participated in
a San Antonio mariachi festival,
the first of its kind, headlined by
Mariachi Vargas.
Mufioz said she fell in love with
the band and attended the festival
habitually for the next five years.
What followed was a tO-year
hiatus when no mariachi festivals
were held in San Antonio. During
that time, Munoz studied adver-
tising, specializing in Hispanic
markets and eventually founded
her own company, Mufioz Public
Relations, which she used to res-
urrect the idea of a festival head-
lined by Mariachi Vargas. She has
been producing the Mariachi Var-
gas Extravaganza in San Antonio
for 18 years and has also started
mariachi festivals in other parts
of Texas.
"Every time I produce a con-
cert of theirs or I see one of their
shows, I feel that same level of
excitement that I did when I was
13 years old," Mufioz said. "Their
music is just exhilarating. It
brings out this feeling of incred-
ible pride for the culture."
Mariachi music permeates
many facets of Hispanic culture.
Mariachi bands perform during
La Posada, a Christmas festival
that reenacts Mary and Joseph
searching for lodging. Bands and
revelers go house to house and
play traditional holiday songs.
It is also popular for mariachi
bands to serenade mothers on
the eve of Mother's Day. The bal-

lad "Oh Madre Querida" - or "Oh
Beloved Mother" - is often used

Mariachi Vargas shared the
stage with members of the Hous-
ton Grand Opera, performing their
original songs.
As unlikely as it seems, Munoz
believes that there is a lot of cross-
over between opera and mariachi.
Many young people who study
mariachi also study opera, she
said.
"When you come to the show,
you'll think this is Spanish opera,"
Mufioz said. "They play tradition-

influenced by operatic and sym-
phonic styles."
Truly Render, press and mar-
keting manager for UMS said the
2010 Mariachi Vargas show was
her first concert with UMS and
also one of the best she's ever seen.
"The audience was just as much
a part of that experience as the art-
ists were," Render said."There was
a really beautiful moment when
one of the audience members, an
older gentlemen, was singing along
and one of the singers from the
ensemble noticed him singing, and
they gave him the microphone and
he sang the whole song." .
Extending the theme of com-
munity, AARP is sponsoring a bus
that will bring residents of Latin
Americans for Social and Econom-
ic Development Senior Center in
Detroit to the concert. Many of the
residents are first generation Mex-
ican immigrants, who are very
excited to see Mariachi Vargas.
Gabriela Boyd, a senior citizen
who works for LA SED will be in
attendance. Boyd described what
mariachi music means to her.
"It's a representation of life
and enthusiasm about life," Boyd
said. "It is very happy, very rhyth-
mic. For us it's like vibrating with
them. It's part of our culture since
we're born. It's really a wonderful
occasion to experience that."
The Jan.27 performance at Hill
Auditorium is sure to transcend
stereotypes and showcase maria-
chi's vivid history, present stars
and up-and-coming talents.
"Youhave 13 phenomenal musi-
cians and some of the best vocal-
ists in the world that are playing
instruments that seem like it is
an entire symphony," Munoz
said. "It's very beautiful, it's very
upscale and it really does present
the best of the Hispanic culture."

ta the most wonderful time
of the year! No, not Christ-
mas: restaurant week. I
hesitate to call myself a seasoned
vet of this foodtastic event, so
I'll opt for
the humbler
idiom of "this
ain't myfirst "
rodeo."

because you couldn't keep up with
that "healthier you" New Year's
resolution? No matter your situ-
ation, there's a restaurant week
option out there for you. So, to
help you on your quest for reason-
ably priced, high-class cuisine,
I've compiled this simple guide to
restaurant week musts and busts.
MUST: Logan
Eateries like this are exactly
what make restaurant week such
a cool event. How often do col-
lege students geta chance to eat
Zagat-rated food at one of the
top 10 restaurants in the Metro
Detroit area? With the price of a
dinner for two normally creeping
toward triple digits, I'm guess-
ing the answer is "not often."
But during restaurant week, the
opportunity is there.
Boasting "New American
Cuisine," ahot (albeit ambigu-
ous) genre in the culinary world
right now, Logan has a great
menu lineup for restaurant week
that I'm more than excited to
check out. For the first course; I
recommend the crab and avocado
parfait; the Logan salad - fea-
turing an undoubtedly complex
30-year-old sherry vinaigrette
- should be your second-course
choice. All options for the main
course are winners, though I'll
probably opt for the seared sea
scallops with aromatic Thai
coconut milk sauce.
At $28 for a three-course meal
from this highly esteemed estab-
lishment, we salute you, Ann
Arbor Restaurant Week, for get-
ting college kids and good food
together again.
Other MUSTS: Cafe6Felix
(five courses for $28!), The
Ravens Club (huge variety),
Pacific Rim (an Asian-fusion
heaven, though Chef Du
wouldn't like it to be referred to
as such) and Mani Osteria & Bar
(a large selection of nationally
recognized pizza).
LUNCH MUST/DINNER
BUST: The Blue Nile
Inevitably, there comes a time
- in the natural course of get-
ting to know new people - when
the rules of social interaction
dictate that I divulge my job here
at the Daily. Also inevitably, the
response I hear is always the
same: "Food critic? Great! What's
the best restaurant in Ann
Arbor?" After a quick smile and

light laugh, my political answer
(as I really don't answer their
question at all) is, "You should
try the Blue Nile!"
You see, the Blue Nile is cer-
tainly not the best restaurant in
Ann Arbor, but for most people,
it offers a completely new din-
ing experience. My first taste of
Ethiopian food came from the
Blue Nile, and I have a feeling
that this experience is not an
uncommon one
But beyond that, the food here
is fantastic. It'swarm, hearty,
saturated to the max with herbs
and spices and surprisingly
healthy. I don't want to give too
much away, but I do have a couple
of things that I'll ask you to keep
in mind: One, you'll never miss
the meat with their vegetarian
options, and two, make sure to
order an Ethiopian teasor coffee
to sip on while you wait for your
food.
Musts, busts
and much more!
This restaurant is a must at
lunch (two people eat for $15) but
a bust at dinner ($28 per person
for a drink, first course and a des-
sert that you don't really want).
Other LUNCH MUSTS/DIN-
NER BUSTS: Blue Tractor (the
food you would normally order at
an even better price), Gratzi (try
the gnocchi tartuffata as part of
your three-course lunch), Shali-
mar (the mango shrimp is where
it's at) and Jolly Pumpkin (I tend
to prefer their lunch offerings
over their dinner, anyway - go
for the lamb burger).
BUST: bd's Mongolian Grill
Notthat I have anything
against being overcharged to
stand in line and have my bowl of
stir-fry pulverized by obnoxious,
loudly clanged swords and served
with overcooked rice, but there
really are much better restaurant
week options: 54, to be exact.
The price is not much cheaper
than any other week of the year,
and the food is no less mediocre.
Maybe McDonald's should be
allowed to join restaurant week,
too.
Other BUSTS: Grand Traverse
Pie Company (better suited for
those I-need-to-eat-now-or-I'm-
going-to-die momentsathan res-
taurant week), The Chop House
(the menu'sworst offerings come
together to lure in restaurant
weeknoobs) and Real Seafood
Company (take note that it's not
called the Fresh Seafood Com-
pany).
And just so you know that I
really do walk mytalk, I'll per-
sonally be hitting up Logan and
The Ravens Club thisweek, and I
hope to see you there! bd's Mon-
golian Grill? Not so much.
Wood is eating all of the
food at Logan. To join, e-mail

Weekend song of the same name.
I ended up ordering a glass of
horchata and a chicken pupusa,
which Sylvia described as a little
Salvadoran pizza.
The pupusa was shaped like a
hand-sized pita bread, filled with
a tasty meat-and-bean stuffing. It
came with a side of salsa, which I
dipped the pupusa in, relishing in
the delicious flavor. The horcha-
ta, which was chilled and tasted
creamy and almost chocolatey,
was equally delectable.
Afterward, I sat down with
Joe Rivers, Sylvia's husband - as
Sylvia was busy expanding her
brand and meeting with potential
clients about catering a wedding
- and discussed the restaurant's
cuisine, an homage to Sylvia's
homeland of El Salvador.
"Salvadoran food sort of has a
particular style of its own," Riv-
ers said. "It tends to be alot more
grains. Because of the dynamics
of El Salvador itself, there's a lot
less meat in things. There's virtu-
ally no dairy."
"And Sylvia does very much
believe in locally-produced ingre-
dients," Rivers continued. "So, we
do as much.organic as we can."
The restaurant, Riversawent on
to describe, was founded 12 years
ago and named after Sylvia's
aunt, Pilar, who ran a successful
tamale business in Ann Arbor in
the'80s and'90s.
"There's definitely sort of a lin-
eage with these tamales," Rivers
said. "The tamales that we make
are the same family recipe that
(Sylvia's) grandmother made in

El Salvador, the same ones that
they grew up with."
Pilar's is completely family-
run and operated, and the vibrant
dining room area is decorated
with Salvadoran paintings and
memorabilia and is populated by
a nuniber of assorted customers.
"We have a very diverse cli-
entele," Rivers said. "Sometimes
we get academics who are having-
staff parties or parties at home.
But, like I said, I think people just
recognize the quality and the fla-
vor, and if it's within their pock-
etbook, they do iton a consistent
basis."
In their 12 yearsof business,
Sylvia has created over 40 differ-
ent flavors oftamales, 30 of which
come back each year. This Valen-
tine's Day, the restaurant is even
introducing a strawberry and
chocolate tamale..
Overall, Pilar's Tamales has
high-quality, flavorful food at an
inexpensive price and a rousing,
Salvadoran atmosphere.
On the complete opposite
side of town, Tmaz Taqueria is
a- small Mexican restaurant in a
plaza on Packard. After finding a
spot in the crowded parking lot,
I entered the restaurant and was
greeted by Cesar Hervert, the
owner and manager.
Compared to Pilar's, Tmaz
had a very relaxed atmosphere.
The yellow walls are not quite as
vibrant and the music is certainly
calmer than the upbeatsongs that
echoed through Pilar's, but the
food smells just as delicious.
