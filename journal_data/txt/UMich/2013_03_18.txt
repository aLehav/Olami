DEVELOPMENT
Building
networks,
building
the 'U'
Office of Development
grows network in
U.S. and worldwide
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
On a cloudy day in February, Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Coleman
arrived in Lansing to applaud a small
increase in state higher education
funds.
Preceded by a decade of state fund-
ing cuts - the most drastic under Gov.
Rick Snyder - for higher education,
2013 marked the second consecutive
state budget containing a two-percent
increase for institutions of higher
learning. While the increase marks an
encouraging trend, Coleman said in an
interview with The Michigan Daily last
month that the upswing is not enough
even after years of careful cost cutting.
As state legislators struggle to restore
the $1 billion lost in funding over the
past ten years that hurled the state of
Michigan from ranking among the top
10 best-funded institutions to the bot-
tom, the University continues to count
on private fundraising to help make up
the difference, according to Coleman.
"I can't imagine that philanthropy
won't continue to be really important
in the future," Coleman said. "The rea-
son is I cannot see a scenario where any
state can meet all of the funding needs
for the University and keep it accessible
and affordable."
Philanthropy's impact and scope
have increased over recent decades. In
the 1990s, the University was the first
public university to complete a billion-
dollar fundraising campaign. In 2008,
the University concluded its last cam-
paign, The Michigan Difference, which
raised $3.2 billion for the University,
compared to $72 million during the first
campaign that ran from 1961 to 1967
Though the next campaign isn't set
to launch until November, University
development officers are on a constant
mission to engage alumni and poten-
tial donors, an effort that increasingly
spans across the nation and the globe.
Jerry May, the University's vice pres-
ident of development, presides over a
630-person staff to fulfill these goals.
May said developing quality relation-
ships is crucial to good fundraising;
taking the time to discover a donor's
interests and passions that can be best
connected with aneed ofthe University.
For example, a former Business
School dean and Program in the Envi-
ronment dean wanted to create a
program together that would allow
students to understand the complexity
of businesses wrestling with sustain-
ability issues. As the deans developed
the program, gift officers connected
the project to a donor with a particular
interest in sustainability.
"When it comes to fundraising for a
great non-profit organization, we are so
fortunate that the University of Michi-

gan provides the kind of education that
so many people that live here can turn
around later and say, 'I'm going to give
to Michigan because of how Michigan
treated me,' "Mays said. "We never can
take that for granted."

contract
offer -
University extends
proposal after union
left bargaining table
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily Staff Reporter
After walking away from the bar-
gaining table Thursday night, the Uni-
versity's bargaining team contacted the
Graduate Employee's Organization with
a revised . four-year contract that has
caused the union to reconsider an agree-
ment.
With legislation that limits unions'
ability to organize within workplaces
taking effect in Michigan on March 28,
GEO had been meeting with the Univer-
sity every day last week until Thursday,
when it decided not enough movement
was being made by the University on
central issues. The union, which repre-
sents graduate student instructors and
graduate student staff assistants, decid-
ed to take its chances negotiating with
the University when its contract expires
in 2014, said GEO spokeswoman Emily
Howard, a Rackham student.

Twitter exec Dick
Costolo will speak
at commencement
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily News Editor
Let's just say it probably won't be
done in 140 characters or fewer.
On May 4, those attending the
university-wide commencement cer-
emony will hear from 1985 alum Dick
Costolo, the current chief executive
officer of Twitter. Costolo will also
receive an honorary Doctor of Laws
degree in recognition of his achieve-
ments pending approval bythe Univer-
sity's Board of Regents.
University President- Mary Sue
Coleman told The Michigan Daily that

Costello's role in transforming Twit-
ter into a powerful and ubiquitous part
of everyday communication had pro-
foundly impacted the way that people
interact with one another.
"(His) entrepreneurial drive, being
at the leading edge of a revolution
in communication, and the impact
of Twitter on the world ... he deeply
understands the ways that this affects
people's interactions with each other,"
Coleman said. "It's that broad view
that caught my attention."
In an interview Sunday with the Daily,
Costolo said he was deeply honored -
and surprised - by Coleman's invitation
for him to address his alma mater.
"I asked them if they had the wrong
number," Costolo said jokingly.
During his time at the University of
Michigan, Costolo was a member of Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity - commonly

called FIJI - and practiced amateur
improvisational comedy. In an unusual
move for a graduate with a bachelor's
degree in computer science, he then
spent time in Chicago trying his luck as
a standup comedian before beginning to
work on web-based projects in 1996. Cos-
tolo founded three companies, the lastof
which, Feedburner, was sold in 2007 for
$100 million to Google, where he worked
in various capacities until 2009.
The same year, Twitter hired Costo-
io as its chief operating officer. A year
later, he became its chief executive
officer, replacing Evan Williams.
In November, Costolo addressed a
full house at Rackham. Auditorium,
where he shared his experiences in the
technology sector and some anecdotes
about his personal life. Coleman said
during that visit, he talked with her

RESEARCH
University partners
with Israeli school

LEAN iN

$1M partnership with
university in southern
Israel to focus on
alternative fuels
By WILL GREENBERG
For the Daily
The University recently announced
it will partner with the Ben-Gurion
University of the Negev in Beersheba,
Israel to research renewable energy
technologies. Faculty from both uni-
versities will be accepting and work-
ing on proposals for research projects
in renewable energy..
The two universities will contrib-
ute a combined total of $1 million to
the intoxicated collaboration. Univer-
sity Vice President for Research Ste-
phen Forrest said the relationship is
intriguing for both institutions.
"This is a really exciting opportu-
nity," Forrest said, "It's opening a lot
of doors."
Ben-Gurion has already had suc-
cess in renewable energy technolo-
gies, Forrest noted.
"The one energy source that they
have unquestionably in abundance is
solar," Forrest said. "They have a very
practical attitude toward developing
alternative energy sources."

In addition to solar energy, algae-
generated energy and thermoelectric-
ity are major focuses of Ben-Gurion's
prior research, Forrest said.
"We're pretty open-ended at this
point," Forrest said. "We pay our fac-
ulty part, they pay their faculty part,
but they have to be joint projects.
We're inviting them to come forward
with their ideas and then we will eval-
uate the best ideas and come (up with)
the best proposals."
Chemical Engineering Prof. Mark
Barteau, the director of the Universi-
ty of Michigan Energy Institute, said
the initial focus of the joint research
projects will be on energy areas such
as solar energy, transportation fuels
and thermoelectric materials.
"The idea is that each project will
involve a faculty collaborator from
each institution," Barteau said. "It's
a way for us to broaden our network
and look for opportunities to both
apply and expand the kind of energy
research that's going on atthe Univer-
sity of Michigan."
Both Barteau and Forrest said the
partnership should provide opportu-
nities for student exchanges between
the universities. The hope is that stu-
dents will gain new perspectives from
working with researchers from other
parts of the world and see how people
living in different climates approach

MoJo becomes co-ed

45 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK
(MARCH 20,1968):
The University's Board of
Governors of Residence Halls
approved the transformation of
Mosher-Jordan Residence Hall
into a co-ed facility in response
to a shortage of men's living
units across campus. A surplus
of women's housing occurred
because of the increased amount
of women being allowed to live
off-campus.
With sufficient discussion
and tours of the proposed modi-
fications, the women who origi-
nally expressed concern about
the hall's atmosphere said the
building changes "would satisfy,
their complaints."

30YEARSAGO THIS WEEK 15 YEARSAGO THIS WEEK
(MARCH 22,1983): (MARCH 23,1998):

In a 40-15 vote, the faculty
Senate Assembly agreed to
amend its policies for non-clas-
sified research.
Changes to the policy includ-
ed a prohibition on research in
which the "substantial purpose
is to destroy or permanently
incapacitate human beings."
The resolution amending
the policy also asked Univer-
sity administrators to appoint a
committee to monitor research
policies of individual col-
leges and schools, which were
encouraged to each create their
specific policies based on their
research activities.

After almost a full season
of being interim head coach of
Michigan basketball, Athletic
Director Tom Goss named Brian
Ellerbe to full-time status, mak-
ing him Michigan's 14th head
coach.
After a second-round loss
in the NCAA tournament to
UCLA, Goss said he talked with
many other possibilities around
the country, including Seton
Hall's Tommy Amaker and
Oklahoma's Kelvin Sampson.
Goss said he decided on Ellerbe
because he "showed us a lot over
the past several weeks."

Community benefits by
UMHS rise 18 percent

Hospital to continue
assistance for those
without coverage
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily StaffReporter
The University of Michigan
Health System has significantly
increased the amount of hospi-
tal-based community benefits,
including outreach and reduced-
fee services, which grew 18 per-
cent in just one year.
The Michigan Health &
Hospital Association's report,
released on Monday, disclosed
that UMHS provided about $362
million worth of donated servic-
es in the 2011 fiscal year.'
This yearly report assesses
the health system's community
donations as a springboard for
enhancedbenefits.
The report states that hospi-
tals across the state of Michi-
gan are improving the safety,
efficiency and quality of patient
care in addition to making an
economic impact by providing
affordable health care.
Efforts such as Meals on
Wheels, free or reduced-price
screenings, health classes and
training for new doctors and
medical research have fed
into the statewide 33-percent
increase in hospital-based com-
munity benefits over the past five
years, according to the report.
Community benefit services
and programs are self-report-
ed through an online form for
each department and through
the financial office, said Maria
Thomas, community benefit and
community health assessment
director to the hospital..
"It's a duo-capturing structure
in that the programs and services
themselves are self-reported, but
for the financial and uncompen-
sated care piece is tracked by the
financial department," Thomas'
said.
She also said there is a possibil-
icy that the actual figures maybe
larger than the reported number.
"Because it is self.-reported,

.

it's likely that we're not captur-
ing all of the community benefits
we provide," Thomas said. "We
imagine a fair amount of it goes
unreported and the actual figure
is larger than reflected."
UMHS's community benefits
are largely the costs of provid-
ing health care to people with-
out health insurance or people
whose insurance doesn't cover
the full cost of their care. The
unpaid hospital-care costs.
totaled $197 million in 2011, with
about 10 percent coming from
UMHS, according to the report.
Educating new doctors and
devoting hospital funds to
research and other community-
oriented programs led by UMHS
faculty accounts for the rest of
the donated services, about $165
million.
The Affordable Care Act
has permitted more uninsured
Michigan residents to be eligi-
ble for Medicaid or discounted
insurance rates. UMHS plans to
continue to offer discounts and
assistance to those participating
in the programs to help those
still without coverage.
While these services and pro-
grams are beneficial for the sur-
rounding communities, Thomas
said it sends a signal that there is
a gap in access to health care.
"It's a double-edged sword,"
Thomas said. "On one hand, the
fact that figures have risen con-
sistently over a year reflects a
deep-rooted commitment on the
part of the health system to the
community, but there is clearly a
need."
Inaddition,UMHSisapartner
in the Washtenaw Community
Health Organization; which pro-
vides the Medicaid-eligible and
uninsured population with men-
tal health and substance abuse
services.
The Washtenaw Health Initia-
tive is a voluntary collaboration
aiming to find ways to improve
access to health care services for
residents who are low-income,
uninsured and utilizing Medic-
aid. WHI is composed of UMHS,
Saint Joseph Mercy Health Sys-

tem, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare
System and other community
services.
Outside of the four walls of the
hospital, UMHS faculty and med-
ical students provide free health
care in the area surrounding Ann
Arbor. Theyvolunteer in facilities
such as the Corner Health Clinic,
Robert J. Delonis Center, Hope
Clinic, Packard Community Clin-
ic and Migrant Health Clinics.
UMHS also partners with gov-
ernment-run initiatives includ-
ing the Michigan Department of
Community Health and Michigan
Department of Education. It does
work in the Ann Arbor, Willow
Run and Ypsilanti public school
systems, running school-based
health centers in the Regional
Alliance for Healthy Schools.
Meals on wheels, a senior
nutrition program, is supported
by the organization's fundraising
efforts and funds from the health
system. In addition, the hospital
aids in food preparation creating
a mutually beneficial relation-
ship for patients, the organiza-
tion and the health system, said
Beth Adams, director of Ann
Arbor Meals on Wheels.
"I think it's a great partner-
ship," Adams said. "There is such
a strong linkage between health
and nutrition that it really makes
sense for this program to be sup-
ported by the health system and
the community. For a lot of our
clients, the meals are the source
of their most nutritious food."
Inthe futurethe organization
is hoping to add an alternative
vegetarian entree and expand
services to more seniors with
Ann Arbor addresses. Last year's
increase in donated programs
and services is a good omen for
expansion efforts, Adams said.
"I'm not surprised, especially
the percentage around uncom-
pensated and charity care,
with the economy, Medicare
and Medicaid reimbursements
changing there's going to con-
tinue to be a greater demand for
programs like Meals on Wheels,"
she said.

Bills created to
end'farm animal

An undercover video that
showed California cows strug-
gling to stand as they were prod-
ded to slaughter by forklifts led
to the largest meat recall in U.S.
history. In Vermont, a video of
veal calves skinned alive and
tossed like sacks of potatoes
ended with the plant's closure
and criminal convictions.
Now in a pushback led by the
meat and poultry industries,
state legislators across the coun-
try are introducing laws mak-
ing it harder for animal welfare
advocates to investigate cruelty
and food safety cases.
Some bills make it illegal to
take photographs at a farm-
ing operation. Others make it a
crime for someone such as an
animal welfare advocate to lie
on an application to get a job at

Deaths and injury
* rise due to alcohol
poisoning
Libya's health minister says
the death toll from drinking
homemade alcohol that con-
tained poisonous methanol has
risen to 87.
Minister Nouri Doghman says
1,044 people have been harmed.
He said Sunday that 15 people
were blinded, and others went
into comas or suffered kidney
failure. He said some people
admitted themselves to the hos-
pital too late, contributing to them
increasing toll.
The deaths were first reported
a week ago.
The dead range in age from 19
to 50 years old.
The sale and consumption of
alcohol is banned in the conser-
vative North African country.
Like illegal drugs elsewhere,
some Libyans turn to black mar-
ket dealers to buy alcohol, which
is often cooked in homes or
deserted farms.
He was recaptured both times.

City State's hundreds of residents, he shook hands of the parishioners and kissed babies.

Pope Francis
greets bystanders
with handshakes
VATICAN CITY (AP) -
Walking up to crowds, shaking
hands with surprised bystand-
ers in the street, mixing his for-
mal speeches with off-the-cuff
remarks, Pope Francis stamped
his own style on the papacy
Sunday.
His humor and down-to-
earth manner captivated those
filling St. Peter's Square in
Rome to overflowing, and he
,worked the crowd in a way that
hadtogive his securitystaffpal-
pitations. Rome Mayor Gianni
Alemanno, in the square him-
self, estimated the crowd's size
at 300,000.
"Brothers and sisters, 'Buon
giorno,"' Francis said in Italian
in his first welcome from the
window of the papal residence,
setting an informal tone that
has become the definig spirit
of his young papacy. -.
Earier Sunday, he made an
impromptu appearance before
the public from a side gate of the
Vatican that startled passers-
by and prompted cheers as he
shook hands and kissed babies.
Francis had just finished cel-
ebrating Mass and delivering
a six-minute homily - brief
by church standards - in the
Vatican's tiny parish church, St.
Anna, when he walked outside
to greet parishioners one by one,
just as an ordinary pastor does
after weekly services.
Francis started speaking at
the window even before the
stroke of noon -- the appoint-
ed time for the weekly papal

address. The windows of the
papal study in the Apostolic
Palace were opened for the first
time since Francis' predeces-
sor, Benedict XVI, gave his last
SundayblessingonFeb. 24. Four
days later, Benedict went into
retirement, the first pontiff to
do so in nearly 600 years.
Francis, the first pope from
Latin America, was elected
Wednesday and has been stay-
ing in a hotel on the Vatican's
premises until the papal apart-
ment is ready.
"The pope is down-to-earth.
He is a people person and it is
amazing," said Emanuel Anat-
sui from Britain. "He is going to
do wonderfully for the church."
After Mass, Francis again
put his security detail to the
test as he waded into an inter-
section just outside St. Anna's
Gate. Francis stepped up to the
crowd, grasping outstretched
hands. The atmosphere was so
casual that several people even
gripped Francis on the shoulder.
"Francesco! Francesco!"
children shouted his name in
Italian. As he patted one little
boy on the head, he asked "Are
you a good boy?" and the child
nodded.
"Are you sure?" the pope
quipped.
At one point he glanced at his
watch and turned to an aide -
as if to ask "How much time do
I have?"
The pope then ducked back
inside the Vatican's boundaries
to dash upstairs for the address
to St. Peter's Square.
Often abandoning the pre-
pared text in his hand, Francis
told the crowd thathe wanted to
talk about mercy, saying he was
inspired by a book about forgive-

ness that he was reading. Citing
the author, an elderly German
cardinal, and praising him as a
"top-notch" theologian, Francis
quipped: "Don't think I'm mak-
ing publicity for my cardinals'.
books!" drawing a roar of laugh-
ter from the crowd.
Francis said mercy can
"change the world" and make
it "less cold and more just."
He spoke only in Italian -
ending with "Buon pranzo"
(Have a good lunch) - a wish
that triggered nods of approv-
al from the crowd in Rome,
where a leisurely Sunday fam-
ily lunch is a cherished tradi-
tion.
But Francis did tweet in
English and other languages,
saying: "Dear friends, I thank
you from my heart and I ask
you to continue to pray for
me."
Past pontiffs have used the
Sunday window greetings
to offer brief reflections and
wishes in several languages.
Vatican spokesman the Rev.
Federico Lombardi said Fran-
cis would likely stick with
Italian, a language he's com-
fortable with for spontaneous
remarks. Lombardi left open
the possibility the 76-year-old
pope would use other languag-
es in future public appear-
ances.
During his window speech,
Francis also talked about of his
family's roots in Italy's north-
western Piedmont region. He
told the crowd that by naming
himself as pope after St. Fran-
cis of Assisi, an Italian patron
saint, he was "strengthening
my spiritual tie with this land,
where, as you know, my family
has its origins."

Attorney general
to continue
investigating
community
STEUBENVILLE, Ohio (AP)
- Two members of Steubenville's
celebrated high school football
team were found guilty Sunday
of raping a drunken 16-year-old
girl, and Ohio's attorney general
warned the case isn't over, say-
ing he is investigating whether
coaches, parents and other stu-
dents broke the law, too.
Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'Lik
Richmond, 16, were sentenced to
at least a year in juvenile prison
in a case that has rocked this
Rust Belt city of 18;000 and led to
allegations of a cover-up to pro-
tect the Steubenville High team,
which has won nine state cham-
pionships. Mays was ordered
to serve an additional year for
photographing the underage girl
naked.
They can be held until they
turn 21.
The two broke down in tears
after a Juvenile Court judge
delivered his verdict. They later
apologized to the victim and the
community, Richmond- strug-
gling to speak through his sobs.
"My life is over," he said as he
collapsed in the arms of his law-
yer.
The crime, which took place
after a party last summer,
shocked many in Steubenville
because of the seeming callous-
ness with which other students
took out their cellphones to
record the attack and gossiped
about it online. In fact, the case
came to light via a barrage of
morning-after text messages,
social media posts and online
photos and video.
"Many of the things we
learned during this trial that our
children were saying and doing
were profane, were ugly," Judge
Thomas Lipps said:
Immediately after the verdict,
Ohio Attorney General Mike
DeWine said he will convene a
grand jury next month to investi-
gate whether anyone else should
be charged. Noting that 16 people
refused to talk, many of them
underage, DeWine said pos-
sible offenses to be investigated
include failure to report a crime.
"This community desperately
needs to have this behind them,
but this community also desper-
ately needs to know justice was
done and that no stone was left
unturned," he said.
Among those who have been
interviewed are the owners of

one of the houses where parties
were held that night, the high
school principal, and the football
team's 27 coaches, many of them
volunteers.
Text messages introduced
at the trial suggested the head
coach was aware of the rape
allegation early on. DeWine
said coaches are among officials
required by state law to report
child abuse. The coach and the
school district have repeatedly
declined to comment.
Mays and Richmond were
charged with penetrating the
West Virginia girl with their
fingers, first in the back seat of a
moving car after a mostly under-
age drinking party on Aug. 11,
and then in the basement of a
house.
"They treated her like a toy,"
prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter
said.
Prosecutors argued that the
victim was so intoxicated she
couldn't consent to sex that night,
while the defense contended the
girl realized what she was doing
and was known to lie.
The girl testified she could not
recall what happened but woke
up naked in a strange house after
drinking at a party.
"It was really scary," she said.
"I honestly did not know what to
think because I could not remem-
ber anything."
She said she believed she was
assaulted when she later read
text messages among friends
and saw a photo of herself
naked, along with a video that
made fun of her and the alleged
attack.
Three other boys, two of them
on the football team, saw some-
thing happening that night and
didn't try to stop it but instead
recorded it with their cellphones.
Granted immunity to testify, they
confirmed the girl was assaulted
and said she was so drunk she
didn't seem to know what was
happening.
Evidence at the trial also
included sexually explicit text
messages sent by numerous stu-
dents after the party. Lawyers
noted how texts have seemed to
replace talking on the phone for
young people. A computer foren-
sic expert documented hundreds
of thousands of texts found on 17
phones seized during the investi-
gation.
In sentencing the boys, Lipps
urged parents and others "to
have discussions about how you
talk to your friends, how you
record things on the social media
so prevalent today and how you
conduct yourself when drinking
is put upon you by your friends."

Palestinians skeptical of
Obama visit, peace agenda

See president as
unlikly to put
pressure on Israel
RAMALLAH, West Bank
(AP) - President Barack
Obama will find a disillusioned
Palestinian public, skeptical
about his commitment to pro-
moting Mideast peace, when he
visits the region.
Obama's trip, beginning
Wednesday, appears aimed pri-
marily at resetting the some-
times troubled relationship
with Israel. 'But winning the
trust of the Palestinians, who
accuse him of unfairly favoring
Israel, could be a far more dif-
ficult task.
After suffering disappoint-
ments during the first Obama
administration, Palestinians
see little reason for optimism in
his new term. The White House
announcement that Obama will
not present any new peace ini-
tiatives strengthened their con-
viction that the U.S. leader isn't
prepared to put the pressure on
Israel that they think is neces-
sary to end four years of dead-
rock in negotiations.
"Obama is coming for Isra-
el, not for us," said Moham-
med Albouz, a 55-year-old

Palestinian farmer. "Obama
will come and go as his pre-
decessors did, without doing
anything."
While Israel is preparing
to give Obama the red-carpet
treatment, there are few signs
of excitement in the West Bank.
Large posters of Obama hung
in Ramallah last week were
quickly defaced, and a small
group of activists called "The
Campaign for Dignity" plans
on releasing black balloons into
the air in a sign of mourning
when Obama arrives.
Obama himself played a
role in reaching the current
deadlock, which stems in large
part from disagreements over
Israeli settlement construc-
tion in the West Bank and east
Jerusalem. The Palestinians
claim both areas, captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war,
as parts of a future state, a posi-
tion that is widely backed inter-
nationally.
When Obama first took
office, he strongly and publicly
criticized the Israeli settle-
ments, saying the construction
undermines hopes for peace.
"It is time for these settle-
ments to stop," Obama said in
a high-profile address to the
Muslim world delivered in
Cairo just months after taking

office.
When Benjamin Netanyahu
was elected Israeli prime min-
ister in early 2009, the Pales-
tinians said they would not
negotiate unless settlement
construction was frozen. They
were further emboldened by
Obama's tough stance.
Obama persuaded Netanya-
hu to impose a 10-month slow-
down, but Palestinians did not
agree to restart talks until the
period was nearly over. When
the Israeli moratorium expired
several weeks later, Netanyahu
rejected American appeals to
extend the slowdown, and the
negotiations collapsed.
Obama stopped pushing the
matter, and talks have never
resumed, and the Palestinians,
viewing Obama as afraid to
take on Israel's allies in Wash-
ington, have few expectations
now.
"What we are going to tell
him behind closed doors is
what we are saying in public.
There is no secret that a suc-
cessful peace process needs a
complete settlement freeze,"
said Nabil Shaath, a top adviser
to President Mahmoud Abbas.
"The Israelis are building on
our land and claiming they
want to negotiate with us about
this land."

NOTABLE QUOTABLE
No pictures should have been sent

Consequential inaction
Congress needs to compromise and pass a budget
ensions in Washington, D.C. continue as the new federal
budget is crafted. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), the chairman
of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, again
authored a proposed budget that would drastically lower domestic
spending and, if implemented, could widen income inequality among
Americans. The Obama administration vehemently disagrees with
the GOP's tactics in balancing the budget and prefers limited cuts
and higher taxes. Chances of a compromise look slim with disagree-
ments remaining unresolved at recent meetings. In order to pro-
mote economic growth, Congress should avoid many portions of
the Ryan plan - especially those involving government spending
- as negotiations continue. Most importantly (and perhaps obvi-
ously), the consequences of not passing a budget last year highlight
the need for Congress to pass a full budget.

I

On March 13, University President Mary
Sue Coleman traveled to Capitol Hill to
emphasize the negative effects of the recent
cuts brought about by the automatic spending
cuts called sequestration that are beginning
to take effect. The prospect of the across-the-
board cuts was meant to pressure lawmakers
to compromise on spending cuts - which did
not happen. "I urge Congress and the presi-
dent to come up with an alternative to across-
the-board cuts in the current sequestration,"
she said. The University estimated last month
that sequestration could potentially cost the
school $40 million in research funding. Many
other programs throughout the state and
University face severe threats of defunding in
the coming years as well.
In February, the officials at the White
House estimated each state's expected losses.
Michigan is slated to lose approximately $22
million in primary and secondary education
funding, $5.9 million in environmental fund-
ing and $1.7 million in job-search assistance.
Other programs such as child care, nutrition
assistance for senior citizens, law enforce-
ment, public health and military readiness
are likely to endure cuts under sequestration,

as well.
These predicted impacts hit closer to home
when examining the estimated cuts for the
University of Michigan. According to The
Office of the Vice President for Research, the
federal government supplied Michigan with
67 percent of the college's overall research
budget of $1.24 billion during the 2011-2012
academic year. With no budget compromise in
Congress, the University could prospectively
lose a large chunk of its research funding.
Sequestration will also cut $10 million from a
very integral part of the U-M Health System.
Cuts to work-study and Pell Grant programs
could dramatically harm lower-income stu-
dents. Overall, the cuts have the potential to
drastically change the way the University and
its health system operate inAnn Arbor.
The government will be forced to make
drastic cuts in government spending through-,
out the nation if-a decision is not rea hei.
The massive funding cuts to various federal
programs will affect nearly all U.S. citizens.
Congress and the Obama administration must
immediately reach a compromise to avoid this
possibility. If not, all of us will face large con-
sequences in the coming years.

have a love/hate relationship
with sleep.
During
the week, the
desire to sleep ,
is an enemy that
threatens my
academic suc-
cess. Yet on the
weekends, sleep
is a rejuvenating
force that makes MICHAEL
me feel glad to SPAETH
be alive. I'm cer-
tainly not the
only one who feels this way.
Sleep is our perpetual frenemy,
especially in college. Most of the
time, we think of sleep as a foe to
be conquered. We treat all-nighters
as badges of honor - great victories
of willpower and resilience over
temptation and resignation. Just the
other day, I saw a Facebook status
proudly proclaiming the completion
of a paper at 5 a.m. We believe that
the physical desire to rest and relax
is a sign of personal weakness rather
than a biological necessity.
This mindset extends into the
workplace. As the world moves
at a breakneck pace and the stack
of work grows larger and larger,
people feel a need to "push harder
rather than rest," according to Tony
Schwartz, the chief executive offi-
cer of The Energy Project. Writing
in The New York Times in February,
Schwartz said that the "prevailing
work ethic in most companies" is
that "downtime is typically viewed
as time wasted."
We've come to accept the notion
that in order to accomplish a greater
amount of work, we need more hours
in the day - and to have more hours
in the day, we need to sacrifice more
hours of sleep. However, despite
societal demands to push ourselves
as much as possible, sleep depriva-

tion is terrible for us. A recent study
found that "the activity of hundreds
of genes was altered when people's
sleep was cut to less than six hours
a day for a week," according to the
BBC. Additionally, "heart disease,
diabetes, obesity and poor brain
function have all been linked to sub-
standard sleep" in studies over the
years, theBBC reported.
A lack of sleep is also bad for busi-
ness. As Schwartz noted, "a recent
Harvard study estimated that sleep
deprivation costs American compa-
nies $63.2 billion a year in lost pro-
ductivity."
So how much sleep should we
get? "It seems getting six to eight
hours of sleep everyday probably
confers the least risk of cardiovas-
cular disease over the long term,"
said Rohit Arora, the author of the
study and the chair of cardiology at
Chicago Medical School.
Sooner or later, we have to accept
that we need more sleep than we're
getting right now. Unfortunately, the
frenetic pace of the workplace isn't
going to slow down anytime soon.
One solution to this problem is to
work in 90-minute intervals. "Dur-
ing the day we move from a state of
alertness progressively into physi-
ological fatigue approximately every
90 minutes," Schwartz explained.
He cited research conducted by
Florida" State University Prof. K.
Anders ricsson,-who has found
that "the best (elite) performers
typically practice in uninterrupted
sessions that last no more than 90
minutes. They begin in the morning,
take a break between sessions, and
rarely work for more than four and a
half hours in any given day."
Another solution is to sneak in a
nap during the day. Some employers
actually encourage their employees
to take naps during the workday.
Google's "energy pods" and The

"Sleep makes us more produc-
tive, more creative, less stressed and
much healthier and happier," Ari-
anna Huffington said on The Today
Show. "I grew up thinking that if
you work around the clock, you are
going to be more effective, and I
realize that is not true."
"If you need an extra two hours
sleep, getting a half an hour is good,
and it helps," Dr. Steven Feinsilver
said in the same segment.
I'll admit that it's difficult to get
enough sleep each day. However, if
we aren't getting enough sleep, it
may be a sign that our course loads
are simply too heavy or that we're
involved in too many extracur-
ricular activities. We also might
be spending too much time using
social media and other websites. In
other words, recurring exhaustion
is a sign that we need to better pri-
oritize our schedules and our lives
in general.
We're hurting ourselves by turn-
ing sleep into our adversary. We
need to embrace sleep and recognize
its benefits for our academic success,
health and general well being. A
good night's sleep, not an all-night-
er, is a true badge of honor.
- Michael Spaeth can be
reached at micspa@umich.edu.

Huffington Post's "nap rooms" are
two examples of companies rec-
ognizing the increased productiv-
ity that can come from well-rested
employees.
Sleep is not our
adversary. We
need to embrace it.

EMMA MANIERE IIVQ T
A discriminatory health policy


On March 14, the Michigan Senate Health
Policy Committee heard testimony regarding
Senate Bill 136, the Religious Liberty and Con-
sciousness Protection Act. If passed, the bill
would "allow a health facility to assertas a mat-
ter of conscience an objection to participating
in a health care service, and decline to partici-
pate in that service." Such objections are most
often issued in relation to abortion care or other
reproductive health services. Associating "con-
science" with not providing a service inherent-
ly neglects the fact that those who do provide
those services may also be ethically driven.
With this bias favoring moral objections over
moral participation, how can this bill really be
about "consciousness protection?" Instead, it's
an ill-begotten maneuver that threatens to sub-
ordinate patient care.
This is not to say that I believe health care
providers should be forced to provide ser-
vices to which they object. In fact, providers
and institutions are already protected by the
Church Amendment. This policy prohibits the
government from requiring health care provid-
ers or institutions to perform or assist in abor-
tion or sterilization procedures against their
moral or religious convictions, and further pro-
tects discriminationagainst such conscientious
objectors. With these basic provisions in place,
the Michigan law seeks to expand protections
from abortion and sterilization services to any
practice, including the removal of a life-sus-
taining device. The bill ensures that providers
who support objections have legal recourse,
extends moral objections to "health care pur-
chasers" and applies to education institutions.
The bill additionally mandates that medi-
cal facilities "adopt and implement a policy to
address situations in which a health provider
had an objection to participating in a health
care service as a matter of conscience." Writ-
ten requests for accommodation and a process
for granting or denying accommodation are
suggested. However, objections will be disre-
garded if a "public health emergency" arises,
no other provider is available to provide the
requested service-or the request is based on the

patient. Of course these stipulations are sub-
jective and are especially relevant to abortion
care, considering that 87 percent of counties in
the United States lack an abortion provider. If a
privately practicing OB/GYN in the upper pen-
insula refuses to provide abortion care and the
nearest clinic is a nine-hour drive away (consid-
ering costs of travel, lodging, taking time off of
work/school and possibly child care), does that
mean that "no other provider was available to
provide that service?"
One way to remedy this problem might be
to offer insurance subsidies to physicians who
practice in rural areas, an incentive offered
in Norway. Another option might be tele-
medication, though House Bill 5711 outlawed
this in Michigan. Finally, though providers
are protected from discrimination, perhaps
the accommodation process should be car-
ried out proportionally to the demand for the
services that would be denied to patients. For
example, the reasons offered for objection
to dispensing birth control by a pharmacist
employed by the only pharmacy in a small,
rural town should be more thoroughly exam-
ined than a pharmacist with a similar view-
point who works in an urban area littered
with options. When opting to decline a ser-
vi, health care providers must reckon with
the ramifications of their decision in order to
ensure patient care is not subordinated.
Finally, I wish to contextualize this bill.
Last year, the bill was dropped after the addi-
tion of an amendment that protected patients
from discrimination based on status - race,
religion, national origin, sex, sexual prefer-
ence, etc. In its current state, SB 136-offers
no comparable definition. Thus, it seems fair
to assume that this bill will be abused as a
mechanism to refuse not only abortion care
and sterilization, but also in-vitro fertiliza-
tion or HIV/AIDS treatment. Not only does
this bill threaten to subordinate patient care,
but, by its very nature, also threatens to per-
mit discrimination.

youMICH is back this year with
a platform that focuses on tangible,
achievable goals that will affect the
lives of students on campus. Our
presidential candidate, Business
and LSA junior Michael Proppe, has
served as Central Student Govern-
ment's speaker of the assembly for a
year and is the president of his busi-
ness fraternity, Delta Sigma Pi. LSA
sophomore Bobby Dishell, our vice
presidential candidate, has served
as an LSA representative since
November and is the vice president
of recruitment for the Interfrater-
nity Council Executive Board. As
CSG members and leaders of student
organizations, Proppe and Dishell
understand that CSG works best
when it works for the lives of the
students. We aim to help with your
student organizations, your campus
community and your academics. We
have already begun work on many of
the initiatives laid out in this View-,
point and cannot wait to continue
this work during the 2012-2013 aca-
demic year.
Student organizations are the
lifeblood of this campus, and CSG
should do everything it can to aid
and empower them. Allocating
fuboding to student organizations
is one of the most important func-
tions of CSG, and one of the ways
CSG can make an immediate dif-
ference in the lives of students.
However, this year, the Student
Organization Funding Commission
has a smaller budget to work with
and many organizations that have
consistently relied on financial sup-
port from CSG are not getting fund-
ed. As president, Proppe will veto
any budget that does not allocate at
least 50 percent of CSG's revenues
to the Student Organization Fund-
ing Commission.
youMICH also will create a Stu-

dent Organization "Sorting Hat"
survey to help match incoming stu-
dents withgroups on canpus.At ori-
entation, new students will be able
to indicate their passions, interests,
organizations they were involved
in during high school and types of
organizations they'd like to join in
college. Organizations can ipdicate
what types of profiles match what
they're looking for, and CSG will put
new students and organizations in
touch with each other. Finally, our
proposed Student Org Network -
which will consist of issue-specific
meetings of leaders, members of
CSG and University administrators
- will result in an unprecedented
level of activism, enthusiasm and
engagement at Michigan. Organi-
zations can collaborate with each
other, tap into CSG's resources and
work with administrators to make
their goals a reality.
The MCard is the key to unlock-
ing the campus community. It gets
us into buildings, exams, sporting
and social events, dining hall and so
much more. But when you're leaving
the tailgate for the football game, it
can be a minor headache to find your
phone, keys, ticket, wallet and, oh
yeah, your MCard. We're working on
an MCard app to eliminate the need
to carry your MCard by incorporat-
ing it right onto your smartphone.
The campus community extends
beyond the immediate campus,
though - there are 43,000 students
at Michigan, and more than 30,000
of them live in neighborhoods off-
campus. Too often, we wake up
to a University crime alert telling
us that one of these students was
assaulted on his or her way home
late at night. Students are not being
provided the safety they deserve.
Our proposed off-campus bus route
is a practical solution to this seri-

ir focus is you

-ous problem. We will work with the
Department of Parking and Trans-
portation Services to ensure a bus
stop within a few blocks of every
major student neighborhood.
The 24-hour cafe in the UGLi has
been a huge success and important
part of academic life on campus.
This is a win for students - more
caffeine to fuel those late-night
cram sessions. This is also a win for
the University - a profitable way
to get students studying longer and
harder. We propose extending this
to the MuJo Cafe in the Duderstadt
Center on North Campus. The caf-
feine-starved engineers and artists
on North Campus deserve the same
round-the-clock support that Cen-
tral Campus students enjoy.
Finally, CSG has done well in
supporting, student entrepreneur-
ship this year, and we want to keep
that work going. We have proposed
creating a five-year combined Bach-
elor's and Master's in Entrepreneur-
ship program that will be housed in
a residence hall. This will give the
innovative and courageous students
at Michigan a University-supported
platform on which to thrive.
We hope these ideas excite you as
much as they excite us, and we are
always open to feedback. Our focus
never leaves you, and our presiden-
tial, vice presidential and repre-
sentative candidates will work to
develop CSG to its full potential.
As students at the nation's premier
public university, our student gov-
ernment should be second to none
when it comes to helping the stu-
dent body. We have selected pas-
sionate, hard-working candidates
who genuinely want to bring to
fruition all the things you want to
see improved.

ADDRESS
From Page 1A
about creating and maintaining
a renewed relationship with the
University and its students.
"He got rave reviews for his
speech," Coleman said. "I think
he's going to be very, very inter-
esting for the student body."
Costolo said he was born a Mich-
igan man - making the opportuni-
tyto speak in the Big House amajor
life moment for him.
"It's really the single gre~at-
est honor I could ever imagine
receiving," Costolo said. "When I
grew up as a kid outside of Detroit
in Troy, I always anted to go to
Michigan. It wag the only uni-
versity I applied to, and I always
knew I wanted to go there."
While Costolo didn't want to give
away too much before commence-
ment, he said his address will focus
on his time at the University, how
it helped shape him and how he
approaches problems to this day.
"It will be highly personal and
based on my experiences at the
University and the way that my
education and time at the Univer-
sity of Michigan shaped the path
of the kinds of choices that I made
in my life and the way I thought
about those choices," he said.
He added that he was encour-
aged to see the increase in entre-
preneurship at the University
since his graduation. Entrepre-
neurship programs and oppor-
tunities have blossomed across
campus due to the focus of several
Central Student Government ini-
tiatives and well as organizations
such as MPowered and the Zell-
Lurie Institute of Entrepreneurial
Studies, among others.
"When I graduated from Mich-
igan with my degree in C.S., I was
in a group at the University my
junior and senior year that was
an entrepreneur's group. There
were five or six of us at the time,"
he said. "It's funny, the University
came out the last couple of years
to San Francisco with a group of
entrepreneurs from the Universi-
ty and it's 200 or 250 people now.
It's funny to go back and think
of the five or six of us who were
really focused on entrepreneur-
ism and starting things and creat-
ing things. That's where it really
* started for me."
Rackham Dean Janet Weiss,
chair of the Honorary Degree
Committee, said that while the
committee is not involved with
the selection of the speaker, they
did review Costolo's nomination
for an honorary degree. She said
the immense amount of interest
that he garnered among Univer-
sity staff and students during his
November visit influenced their
decision.
"There's a lot of accomplish-
ment - a lot of distinction - in
what he's accomplished since his
days at the University of Michi-
gan," Weiss said. "We always like
to recognize University of Michi-
gan graduates in particular, so
that's a plus."
HONORARY DEGREES TO
BE AWARDED
Lisa Connolly, project man-
ager in the Office of the President,
helps coordinate the decision-
making process for the com-
mencement speaker with the
president. She said that the bon-

orary degree award process was
one of mutual benefit for the Uni-
versity and the honoree.
"One of the purposes of honor-
ary degrees is to be meaningful on
both ends to the recipient and to
the University," Connolly said.
Six other individuals will
receive honorary degrees from
the University during the com-

administrator, said the open-air
gallery will be accompanied by
a number of activities and pro-
grams, including a "community
weekend" that offers Ann Arbor
residents free admission and
transportation to the DIA on
April20 and 21.
Seagraves said he is also hoping
to offer walking tours of the art-
work with docents from the DIA
as has been done at similar art
installations elsewhere.
Art & Design Assistant Prof.
Roland Graf said the InsidelOut
program has an interesting effect
in urban landscapes like Ann
Arbor.
"(InsidelOut) creates some-
times very surreal scenes that
sometimes almost look like an

mencement proceedings, all
pending approval by the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents.
Rosabeth Kanter, a business
professor at Harvard University
and University of Michigan alum,
will deliver the graduate exer-
cises address on May 3 to recipi-
ents of graduate degrees. Kanter
is a former editor of the Harvard
Business Review and has pub-
lished many books on sustainable
enterprise and leadership in busi-
ness. Kanter will receive a Doctor
of Humane Letters.
"She's well known in the busi-
ness education world because
of her prominence," Coleman
said of Kantor. "She's just very
admired by folks at the business
school here. I'm delighted that it's
worked out for her to come."
Suzanne Farrell, a ballerina
who performed in a number of
companies throughout the 20th
century, will also receive an hon-
orary degree from the Univer-
sity. Farrell is among the most
noted American ballerinas in his-
tory and also served as a dance
instructor later in her career. In
2000, she formed her own bal-
let company, the Suzanne Farrell
Ballet, which is produced at the
Kennedy Center in Washington,
D.C. She will receive a Doctor of
Fine Arts.
A University alum and gen-
erous philanthropist, William
Brehm, will also be recommended
for an honorary degree. Begin-
ning in the 1960s, Brehm served
in various capacities in the
Department of Defense before co-
founding SRA International, an
information technology consult-
ing companythat primarily focus-
es on national security. Brehm has
donated significantly to the Uni-
versity, most recently providing
$8 million to renovate the School
of Music, Theatre & Dance's Earl
V. Moore Building. He has been
nominated for a Doctor of Laws.
"He has been a tremendous
philanthropist, not just for the
University of Michigan," Coleman
said. "He is also a composer. We
have performed some of his music
here. It is his wide areasof interest,
his desire to do good in the world
... His humanity is hard to express
because he caresso deeply about
the areas that he gives to."
Pulitzer prize winning his-
torian and lecturer David
McCullough will also be noni-
nated for an honorary degree..
McCullough is a prolific author
who has written several biog-
raphies of American presidents
and other historical topics. He
has also received the Presidential
Medal of Freedom, the highest
honor a civilian can earn. He will
be recommended for a Doctor of
Humane Letters.

tional development and extreme
poverty eradication. Sachs has
also authored several New York

art installation because it is so
unexpected to see a nineteenth-
century painting on a brick wall,"
Graf said.
Graf said the program allows the
DIA to reach an audience it may not
have otherwise - he pointed out
that he has met students who have
never visited the museum.
Ann Arbor residents voted
against the public art millage on
the November ballot. Seagraves
said he does not believe this is
indicative of a lack of interest for
programs like InsidelOut.
"Obviously there will be some
connection (to the art millage) in
people's mind because the public
art commission partnered with
the DIA to do this program, but
there's no cost to the taxpayers to
do this, it's all funded by Knight
Foundation," Seagraves said.
The artworks will be displayed
from April until June.

BUILDING

Representatives from specific
schools or. University units also
conduct their own fundraising
efforts as they are especially in
tune with the objectives and pri-
orities of their programs, provid-
ing the added ability to pinpoint
potential donors and projects.
Todd Baily, the Law School's assis-
tant dean for development and
alumni. relations, said the school
receives only 2.5 percent of its
funding fromthe University's gen-
eral fund. Much of the remainder
comes from private contributions.
In addition to' these efforts,
units frequently collaborate with
other schools across campus and
contribute to larger development
goals. Individual schools will
also provide input in the plan-
ning process as the University
gears up for its next campaign.
As evidenced by Baily's title,
development is not only about
money. Engaging alumni often
translates into connections and
employment or internship oppor-
tunities for students or profession-
al expertise for faculty or research.
Before Baily joined the Law
School, he spent more than a
decade in the University's Office
of Development. During that
period, Baily said he saw major
growth in the University's devel-
opment efforts.
"Many years ago, develop-
ment used to be the difference
between good and great," Baily
said. "I think it's now part of the
fabric of the place."
The Office of Development's
physical footprint illustrates the
changes as well. In 1988, Baily
said the office fit on the sixth
floor of the Fleming Administra-
tion Building. Today, it covers two
floors of the much larger Wolver-
ine Tower, farther from campus.
And as development expanded
in Ann Arbor, its reach also began
to extend to various regions
across the nation and the world.
In January, the University's
Board of Regents, as well as sev-

eral University administrators
including Coleman and May,
traveled to California on a trip
that included several fundraising
and alumni events.
California, a state that is home
to 40,000 University alumni, also
houses one-of three regional Uni-
versity offices. The University
opened its Pasadena, Calif. office
two years before the Michigan
Difference campaign launched,
which was soon followedby offic-
es in Boston and New York City.
Stephen Kamm, the senior
director of the University's west-
ern states region, said a satellite
office is valuable for building a
greater intimacy with the region
and understanding the priorities
and movements of people, indus-
try and philanthropic activity.
Kamm said the San Fran-
cisco Bay Area, for instance, has
a strong entrepreneurial spirit
and by developing a presence the
University has been able to con-
nect those alumni to students
and programs.
Forming these connections
can be more difficult due to dis-
tance from Ann Arbor. By locat-
ing major gift officers in a region,
they have the opportunity to form
links to campus, generating not
only funds, but also awareness
and involvement.
While Kamm noted other
institutions such as the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, Johns Hop-
kins University, and Dartmouth
College have also added regional
offices, Harvard University is the
only other university with a larg-
er number of California-based
gift officers than the University.
The Pasadena office manages
development for the entire region.
Kamm has recently moved to
Washington to engage alumni in
the Seattle area, a city with about
10,000 alumni. He plans to travel
to the California office roughly
four times per year and work on
the ground in the Pacific North-
west the rest of the time.
As development expands in
regions with growing alumni
populations, Kamm said there
has been no fundamental shift in

how developmentofficers dotheir
work. He said building deep con-
nections within the community
and placing the University back
on people's radarsis imperative.
Kamm said he doesn't usually
talk about gifts at the first meet-
ing with an alum. The first prior-
ity is to understand what had the
biggest impact during their time
at the University and to find the
areas in which they would like to
reconnect.
Regardless of the different
types of alumni connections,
Kamm said engaging alumni\is
not a hard sell.
"The best memories I can
relate are when a (donor's) pas-
sion bears fruit and they are able
to see the work they have done
has actually impacted a person's
life," Kamm said. "What fund-
raisers do is enable individuals to
impact other individuals' lives."
On the other side of the Pacific,
BarbaraAckley, the assistant vice
president for development and
international giving, is building
similar relationships on other
continents. Based in Ann Arbor,
Ackley was preparingfor a 13-day
trip to Hong Kong, Beijing and
Shanghai the day after the baily
spoke with her last month.
Asia is home to 12,500 alumni
and is the. fastest growing global
region for development potential.
In comparison, there are 3,200
alumni in Europe, 1,600 in North
Africainthe MiddleEast, 2,100 in
North America outside the U.S.,
and 1,700 in Latin America.
. Over the next few months, Ack-
ley has additional trips planned to
Asia, included one specifically in
India, to begin planning for Cole-
man's fall 2013 trip.
Ackley said Asia is usually an
easy trip since the University has
connections to many people there
who have become successful in
their fields. She said the Univer-
sity has historically had a strong
presence in China and hopes to
bring this growth to India and
other countries in the region.
With efforts towards interna-
tional giving expanding over the
past seven to eight years, Ackley

said international alumni are an
untapped resource.
"Not only just for the num-
bers, but for the potential of the
future," ' Ackley said. "These
alumni we are speaking to are
the top CEOs in the world and to
ignore that would be foolish on
our part."
Like state-side alumni, inter-
national Michigan graduates are
constantly looking to hire Univer-
sity students, and development
officers are asking for interna-
tional internship opportunities,
as well.
"That's what I find so exciting
and exhilarating about traveling,
about being able to meet with
people in their homes and allow
them to talk about their coun-
try which they are very proud of
and to talk about the University,
which many of them really love,"
Ackley said.
As the University continues to
grow its local, national and glob-
al development base, engaging
alumni and supporters is more
crucial than ever.
"The University is never going
to get the (necessary) levels of
support from the state, so we need
to add more value," May said.
"You can only increase student
tuition so much. Private support
has to continue to play a growing
role. It's not going to be a substi-
tute, but it's more important than
ever."
But even as development
efforts expand, state funds still
play a crucial role. In-state stu-
dents' 67-percent tuition discount
is a major part of the state's con-
tribution.
However, Coleman said restor-
ing previous state funding levels
will require an accelerated pace
of yearly increases. In Michigan,
and at institutions across the
country, Coleman said institu-
tions are beginning to' cope with
the realities of less money from
public funds.
"(Philanthropy) has definite-
ly grown more in importance
because what people are begin-
ning to realize is you can't rely on
single funding streams."


GEO

"As an official GEO spokes-
person and as someone who was
there Thursday night and saw all
of this personally, none of (GEO
members) had any clue thiswould
happen," Howard said. "We were
so surprised Friday morning
when they contacted us."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said despite GEO's
decision Thursday night, the
University's bargaining team
continued to work on a suitable
proposal.
"This is the bargaining process
at work," Fitzgerald said. "This
give-and-take is the natural part
of collective bargaining and try-.
ing to reach agreement that is
mutually beneficial to the mem-
bers of the bargaining unit and

the University as a whole - that's
where we always hope to end up."
Howard said one of the big-
gest sticking points for GEO was
maintaining language in the cur-
rent contract regarding job secu-
rity. Such language allows GSIs
and GSSAs to receive full ben-
efits and wages for one semester
if they are offered a position that
is then reduced or revoked. The
University wanted to severely cut
these benefits, Howard said. This
was an especially relevant issue to
international students because of
their employment status greatly
affecting their immigration sta-
tus as well.
Because GSIs and GSSAs don't
necessarily work full time, sala-
ries are determined by a fraction
that compares their, work with
a full-time- employee. Howard
said the new proposal addresses
GEO's concerns with the intro-

JTseduces on new
Experience
Acclaimed singer
meets lofty
expectations
By GREGORY HICKS
Daily Arts Writer

.I

What do you do when you're
one of the largest male R&B-pop
sensations the world has ever
seen, and you're
planning to ,-
break out from
your seven-year The 20/20
hiatus? The Eprec
answer is: any-
thing you want.' Justin
The 20/20 Timberlake
Experience
will earn high RCA
certifications
from pre-orders
alone, but that doesn't stop JT
from delivering anything short of
an irresistibly seductive record.
Given trending characteristics
of today's industry (e.g. dubstep,
basic meter), it's refreshing to
witness an artist of Timberlake's
caliber standinghis ground in sty-
listic terms.
With the initial release of his
platinum-selling lead single "Suit
& Tie," listeners picked up on
Timberlake's new record, which
steers toward an old-school
groove. True, the track has a like-
able jazziness, but don't confuse
Timbaland's classic synth pro-
duction with a brass instrument.
In fact, don't confuse mostof Tim-
baland's musical complexion with
an attemptto recreate a long-gone
decade.
A vintage taste surfaces strictly
on the introduction to most tracks
on the record. "Pusher Love Girl"
adopts the swift, orchestral chro-
matics of Ciara and Timberlake's
"Love Sex Magic" collaboration,
preceding a performance brim-
ming with our pop star's antici-
pated falsetto. The time-honored
needle-on-record sound effect

This is the riff-off part two.

introduces "Strawberry Bubble-
gum," channeling a trademark
of Christina Aguilera's Back to
Basics.
Lest we forget about JT's secret
weapon, The 20/20 Experience
is a musical reestablishment for
Timbaland, the king of seductive
syncopation, as well. Undoubted-
ly, the R&B producer was loaded
with inspiration, given that his
last major production (relatively
speaking) was two years ago on
Demi Lovato's Unbroken album.
The (nearly) seven minute-long
tracks might badger some listen-
ers - these track lengths will
never survive radio edits - but
each song is elegantly washed
out with a few minutes of tempo
stretching as JT wraps up the end
of each (arguably lanky) track.
To endure the extensive width of
the album, each song brims with
developments and swift tempo
changes, rather than add three
extra minutes of the same hook
(e.g. Fergie's The Dutchess).
With so much excitement

churning from The 20/20 Expe-
rience - an anticipation years in
the making - now is the time to
walk off the beaten path. Part of
remaining a distinguished art-
ist is having a devoted following
who will essentially find a Way
to enjoy your music regardless of
how incomparable it is to current
trendsetters.
Aside from "Suit & Tie" and
the album's second promotional
single, "Mirrors," the record's
other ingredients lack an instant-
ly gratifying pop-music quality -
certainly justified, given that the
album aims to be a coherent R&B
album, rather than a quick-fix pop
collection of singles. Most notable
characteristics sampled from the
musical bandwagon are Jay-Z's
appearance on "Suit & Tie" and
the somewhat oversimplified
melody and beats of "Mirrors" as
a whole.
"Let the Groove Get In" and
listen to JT as he brings sexy
back to the music industry in 'a
new decade of R&B.

it's been done
many times in
the past and recently in "Lin-
coln" with great success. Unfor-
tunately, this isn't one of those
times.
"Emperor," based on real
events during the end of World
War II, takes place in Japan
amid the physical rubble and
emotional wreckage brought
upon by the atomic bomb. The
narrative follows General Bon-
ner Fellers (Matthew Fox, "Alex
Cross") who has only 10 days
to investigate imperial, politi-
cal and military officials and
determine whether Emperor
Hirohito should hang, guilty of
war crimes, or remain in his rul-
ing position as the United States
steps in to rebuild Japan.
As Fellers searches for the
truth about the Emperor's
involvement and intentions,
he quests for his former col-
lege flame, Aye (Eriko Hatsune,
"Girls for Keeps"), a Japanese
woman whom he fears perished.

Fellers's superior, the man who
has entrusted him with the

set-in-a-foreign-country quality,
but the meticulous art direction
(Jill Cormack, "Avatar") height-
ens the authenticity ofthis period
piece and, along with powerful
and timely scoring (Alex Heffes,
"Love and Honor"), production
has set the stage for an aestheti-
cally stimulating journey, but one
that ends as soon as it begins.
Fox, in his first true leading
role on the big screen, resembles
more of a robot with an emotion-
al on-and-off switch than a man.
His character marches around,
vacillating between angry and
stone-faced and nostalgic and
teary-eyed, a combination that
confuses more than it convinces.

But it's not his fault - the film is
written that way.
Jones shines as a grouchy, yet
surreptitiously tender general
as he fast-talks circles of crudi-
ties and orders around his men,
a familiar and favorite role. This
much needed comic relief, and,
Jones's performance in general
(pun intended), garners far too
little screen time. But, again, it's
not his fault - it's written that
way.
Writers Vera Blasi ("Tortilla
Soup") and David Klass ("Walking
Tall"), who adapted the screen-
play from the book, "His Majes-
ty's Salvation" by Shiro Okamoto,
not only fail to capitalize on their

resources, such as a snarky Jones
and a "Fox" of a leading man, but
the story stews like a promising
batch of meat and potatoes that
never reaches boil, and it makes
for a bland main course. As Fellers
meets with affiliate after affili-
ate, it's hard to keep the affiliates
straight, especially with flash-
backs of his relationship with Aya
dangling in between.
While it "coulda been a con-
tender," the seriously sloppy
adaptation (one that misses
the bull's eye by a mile) leaves
"Emperor" as an inarguably aver-
age illustration of enduring love,
loss and compassion duringtimes
of war.

CHICAGO - This game, unlike the last
time the Michigan and Wisconsin men's
basketball teams met, didn't have heroics. It
didn't have a last-second buzzer beater or a
photo finish.
What it did have was two entirely differ-
ent halves.
Michigan (12-7 Big Ten, 26-7 overall)
couldn't overcome a massive second-half
push by Wisconsin and fell in the second
round of the Big Ten Tournament to the Bad-
gers, 68-59.
The first half was about as bland a half of
basketball as Michigan has played this sea-
son. There were a cou-
ple big, athletic plays MICHIGAN 59
- namely a half-court WISCONSIN 68
heave fromsophomore
guard Trey Burke to guard Tim Hardaway
Jr. that the junior caught high above the rim
before finishing the alley-oop - but points
were few and far between. Michigan's 20
first-half points marked its lowest scoring
half of the season, but if possible, Wiscon-
sin's offense looked even worse.
The Badgers couldn't buy a made basket,
shooting just over 17 percent from the field
in the first stanza, half of Michigan's 34 per-
cent. Nothing was falling, especially during
a scoreless five-minute stretch, while the
two teams combined to shoot 2-for-18 from
3-point range.
The two teams also combined for 14 turn-
overs in the first 20 minutes, which didn't
help to boost offensive numbers on either
side.
It looked like Michigan would be without
Hardaway for the remainder of the half, and
potentially the game, after he fell hard on
his left ankle after missing a short jumper.
Hardaway returned less than five minutes
later, though, fighting through what was
officially announced as a sprained left ankle.
After the game, he said the ankle was stiff,
but that it wasn't too serious.
The second half was a
completely different
animal.
"In the first half,
we were play-
ing pretty good
defense overall,
and it was an
outstanding first
half, " said fresh-
man forward
Mitch McGary.
"In the second
half, I don't know
if we got bored or
something, but we
just weren't commu-
nicating as well and
they were getting too
many open looks. They
caught fire."

didn't let them play well."
Sophomore forward Alex Gup-
till had two goals while junior Luke
Moffatt added three assists to lead a
proficient Michigan offense that dom-
inated from the very beginning of the
game.
Just 1:08 into the game, senior
defenseman Le Moffie sailed a puck
from the top of his own right circle
with laser precision, slicing through
traffic to a streaking senior forward
Kevin Lynch. The puck found Lynch's
stick, he broke free with an open look
and he buried it in the right corner.
With 3:24 left in the same period,
Michigan struggled to clear the puck
out of its zone, scrambling around to
regain control. The Broncos capital-
ized on a disorganized team, though,
as Colton Hargrove's attempt'from
the slot found its way past goaltender
Steve Racine.
The freshman netminder, who
faced just 18 shots on Friday night, had
another easy night between the pipes.
Racine made 22 saves on just 23 shots
from the Broncos.
Three minutes into the second
period, Michigan's offense opened
the floodgates, using'its speed to put
Western Michigan on its heels.
Moffatt, too fast for the Broncos,
found space in the center of the ice to
bring up the puck. The junior dished
to senior forward A.J. Treais, who
was originally stopped by Western
Michigan goaltender Slubowski, who
then slid outside the crease. With the
net wide open, sophomore forward
Andrew Sinelli buried a shot from the
slot, where he had been waiting for
Treais' pass.
The Broncos - who suffered their
first loss in the CCHA playoffs under
second-year coach Andy Murray Fri-
day night - increased their pressure
for the next seven minutes before a
penalty put them a man down.
The Wolverines proved why they
have the second-ranked power play in
the CCHA, swinging the momentum
in their favor when Guptill scored his
first goal of the night 10 minutes into
the period. Following a scramble in
front of the net, where Slubowski once
again spent time outside his crease,
the sophomore took a loose puck and
lifted it too high for the confused
goalie.
"It's one of those nights where the
puck always seems to be on your stick,"
said Guptill, who nowhas14 goals this
season. "Guys made good plays to me,
and I had some good chances."
DeBlois's goal, 49 seconds later,
prompted Murray to pull his netmind-
er. Slubowski, second in the nation in
minutes played, made 20 saves on 24
shots.
"They've got a real good goalie
over there, and we got the best of him
tonight," Treais said. "We caught him
out of position a few times, and a few
of those were empty net, but just get-
ting pucks to the net and getting guys
to the net (made a difference)."
Yet whether it was Slubowski or
ackup, Lukas Hafner, Michigan's
ffense could not be slowed.
With seconds remaining in the
eriod, Moffatt once again brought
he puck down the ice, stopping on
dim at the top of the left circle,
reversing direction and flinging the
puck into the slot. Guptill was there
o take the puck and rip a shot too
quick for Haffner to add a tally with
8 seconds remaining in the frame.
"(Moffatt) wanted to play better
than he did lat night," Berenson
said. "One of his strengths has been
with the puck and he's a shooter, but
he made some plays tonight."
Michigan's penalty kill would
close out the sluggish third period,

For Michigan hockey team, night and day

KALAMAZOO -
t's on to Detroit.
With the NCAA
men's basketball bracket
announced, the Michigan fan-
base will descend en masse on
the Motor City this week to
watch both the men's basketball
and hockey teams duel in their
respective last-chance, single-
elimination games.
Somehow the scripts have been
reversed, though, as these two
teams travel to Detroit on com-
pletely opposite trajectories. One
team captivated the nation, then
limped to the finish line; the other
found new ways to reach rock
bottom all season, then caught
fire at the last minute.
A downward spiral; a pre-
cipitous climb. Stock up, stock
down. Welcome to the madness of
March,my friends.
Go Blue. It's a verb now, appar-
ently.
As he started down the hall-
way after Michigan's 4-3 victory
over Western Michigan on Friday
night, senior alternate captain
Lee Moffie, sporting a goatee
like the rest of the defensemen,
turned back to a pack of report-
ers and gave a rousing "Go Blue."
Then, he made a confession.
"Our team is going blue a little
too hard right now," Moffie said.
Now, do remember that this is
coming from the man that Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson earlier
this season called "gregarious
and outrageous." But maybe
there's something to this "going
blue" business.

True, it really doesn't make
sense. But if we're here to judge
rallying cries, I'd take the hockey
team's new motto over the men's
basketball team's "WE ON" any
day. Come on, people.
A little Elmer's glue, some
binder twine and a new twist on a
well-worn motto were the recipe
that patched together this upstart
Michigan hockey team. A month
ago, facingthe harsh reality that
the Wolverines would miss the
NCAA Tournament for the first
time since 1989-90, Michigan
readjusted its season goal: Reach
the Joe.
It's been night and day since
then.
Before, it was a broken team
playing selfish hockey. Now,
the Wolverines have won eight
consecutive games, and, with a
dominant road sweep of Western
Michigan in the CCHA quarter-
finals over the weekend, they've
punched their ticket to the semi-
finals at Joe Louis Arena.
"It's always been Michigan,"
Berenson said. "Our stock's been
going up and down like General
Motors."
Good man, that Red Berenson,

He was proud now. He, too,

Well, this was the plan all
along for Beilein and Co., wasn't
it?
Buzz through the regular sea-
son; take a swipe at the regular-
season Big Ten title; never drop
out of the top-10 in the national
rankings. Sounds likea down-
right delicious season.
But here's the thing. The Mich-
igan men's basketball team isn't
spanking teams anymore. The
highlight slams and alley-oops
are intermixed with sloppy turn-
overs and missed threes.
The Big Ten is a man's league,
and Michigan got worked over
pretty good a few times. That
21-1 record slipped to26-7 pretty
quickly, and painfully.
But the NCAA Tournament is
a different animal. And now it's
time for the Wolverines and Jack-
rabbits to tangle in Michigan's
backyard - The Palace at Auburn
Hills. The hometownboys are
already 11-point favorites, but that
means little, especially during the
Big Dance.
Michigan is a team with Final
Four expectations, but the ceiling
for this team appears far lower
' than it did a month or two ago.
A four seed in the South Divi-
sion, Michigan is facing an uphill
battle, fighting the odds for just
about the first time all season.
If you've been following Michi-

gan sportstfor a while, this seems
to be life as usual: Michigan hock-
ey is on fire, Michigan men's bas-
ketball is tumbling and fumbling
its way into the postseason. That's
not really the case, of course.
The hockey team still has to
sweep the semifinals and finals
at the Joe to avoid posting its
first sub-.500 record since 1986-
87. But here's another history
lesson: just three years ago, the
Wolverines had to win the CCHA
Tournament to earn an NCAA
Tournament berth, and they did
it - knocking off Miami (Ohio) in
the semifinals, no less.
The history of the men's bas-
ketball team offers no such com-
fort. Fact is, Michigan hasn't seen
a team engineered to win like this
in decades. As announcer Gus
Johnson said earlier this season,
Michigan has an embarrassment
of riches. I'd hate to see thatgo to
waste in the Big Dance.
Circle this Saturday on your
calendar.
It could mark the historic col-
lapse or it could signal the begin-
ning of these Michigan teams'
second seasons.
One day, one night: the end or
the beginning?
We'll have to wait and see -
plus, the basketball team has to
get through South Dakota State
first. It'sbeen night and day of
late for these two programs. And
now they've got only the guaran-
tee of one more game.
It's on to Detroit.

In surprise CCHA run,
a reminder of 2009-10

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
KALAMAZOO - Amid all
the excitement surrounding the
Michigan hockey team's impend-
ing trip to Joe Louis Arena for
its 24th-consecutive appearance
in the CCHA Tournament semi-
finals, the seniors had a chance
to reflect on how their Michigan
careers have come full circle.
This season is eerily similar
to the Wolver-
ines' 2009-10 NOTEBOOK
campaign when
this year's seniors were freshmen.
Michigan went on a miracle run
through the playoffs to keep its
postseason hopes alive after bare-
ly breaking even on the season.
"It feels a lot similar," said
senior forward Kevin Lynch. "It
feels like right now we're on a
streak and can't lose. We know
what's nt stakeW We've eai two

games to finish this off and we're
ready."
This weekend marks Michi-
gan's fourth consecutive sweep
and Lynch chirped at the media
and fans that doubted Michigan
would be standing where it is
today.
"A month ago we told (every-
one) we were a team to be reck-
oned with and that's because guys
in that locker room believed,"
Lynch said. "We showed that we
could play as a team, play with
passion and overcome adversity
any time throughout the year."
Michigan coach Red Berenson
agreed, saying guiding this strug-
gling team has been one of the
most rewarding experiences in his
coaching career.
"I'm really proud," he said.
"I've always said you never give
up on a player and you never give
up on ateam. I'm glad they never
wave um and Iknow t'mLneladlI

never gave up."
PERFECT PENAlTY KILL: The
Wolverines won every battle
against Western Michigan, but
perhaps no victory was as impres-
sive as Michigan's penalty-kill
performance.
Going into the weekend, West-
ern Michigan boasted the third-
best power play in the CCHA, and
prior to the weekend, Berenson
expressed concern that special
teams performance could harm
the Wolverines.
Turns out he had nothing to
worry about - the Michigan
penalty kill had another flawless
weekend, leading Berenson to
assert that it was the best series
the unit has had all season.
"The (penalty kill) was ter-
rific," Berenson said. "(Western
Michigan) got some good looks,
but nevertheless, we got through
with it, whether it was our goalie,
our defense blocking shots or our
forwards."
The Broncos managed to reg-
ister just two shots on net during
the course of their six power plays.
Michigan's penalty kill has killed
off its last 25 penalties, turning it
into the Wplverines' biggest asset.
And most of that has to do with the
do-or-die attitude the team has
adopted moving forward.
"It's the playoffs," said fresh-
man defenseman Jacob Trouba
on Friday. "Our season's going to
be over if we don't win. We know
that, and we know we're playing
the hardest hockey now when it
counts."
SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS,
EVERYBODY: Though both teams
were knotted at one by the time
the first period ended, the game
wasn't as even-matched as it
appeared. By the time the 20-min-
ute mark had passed, Michigan
had woefully outshot Western
Michigan, 15-3.
But it was still a game of inches
- the Broncos had been able to
capitalize on their shots when in
counted, leading the Wolverines
to believe that Western Michigan
could counter with a strong sec-
ond period, asit did with the night
before.
"We knew that it was the score
that counted, it wasn't the shots,"
Berenson said. "We knew we
were playing well (and) we had
to build on that. We came here to
play Michigan hockey on the road,
and that's what we tried to do the
whole game."

Merrill finished with the assist
on Lynch's goal, a plus-one rat-

new mindset for the defense, one
that was absent in the playoff
opener against Northern Michi-
gan on March 8, but has been on
display ever since. To Berenson,
the difference is desperation.
For Moffie, it's about doing
whatever it takes to continue
eliminating the miscues that
proved costly earlier in the sea-
son. Those mistakes were put
under a microscope because
of the poor play of the goalies.
Now that Racine is playing well
between the pipes, the defense
seems more willing to absorb
shots and protect the goalie.
"We're absolutely willing to
do whatever it takes not to let
in a goal," said senior defen-
seman Lee Moffie about the
defense holding a late one-goal
lead. "You're getting in front of
every shot, you're diving, you're
desperate. More importantly,
you're playing sound defense."

Blue gets four seed, to face South Dakota State

Wolverines open at
The Palace in South
Region with Kansas,
Georgetown
By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Editor
After battling for a No. 1 seed
for much of the regular season, the
Michigan men's basketball team
received a No. 4 seed in the South
Region on Selection Sunday.
But after a brief scare over the
weekend, the Wolverines will
have to travel just one hour to
play their opening-round matchup
against South Dakota State at the
Palace of Auburn Hills (Mich.)
on Thursday at 7:15 p.m. Should
Michigan (12-6 Big Ten, 26-7 over-
all) win, it'll advance to play the
winner of Thursday's Virginia
Commonwealth-Akron game on
Saturday, also at the Palace.
Freshman forward Mitch
McGary described his excitement
at an "all-time high" moments
after seeing Michigan's name
appear on CBS's selection show.
"It's what I've always dreamed
of," McGary said. "To play in
Auburn Hills is a blessing, to play
so close to our university, to hope-
fully have a great fan base there."
The Jackrabbits (13-3 Summit,
25-9) won last week's Summit
League Tournament after win-
ning the regular-season crown as
well. South Dakota State is led by
one of the country's most exciting
players, point guard Nate Wolt-
ers. At 22.7 points per game, the

senior was the nation's fourth-
leading scorer. He also averaged
5.6 rebounds and 5.8 points per
game, while shooting an efficient
49.3 percent from the field.
The Jackrabbits played just two
power-conference teams this sea-
son, losing to both Alabama and
Minnesota. While they took the
Crimson Tide to the brink, los-
ing by three, the Golden Gophers
- Michigan's and South Dakota
State's only mutual opponent -
ran away with a 24-point win. But
the Jackrabbits did come up with
a quality non-conference victory,
winning at No. 15 New Mexico,
70-65, in December.
Michigan coach John Beilein
admitted that he knows "very
little" about his opponent, other
than knowing that "they were the
Jackrabbits right away," he said
with a laugh. Butcafter briefly look-
ing over their season statistics,
he's concerned with the amount
of upperclassmen in South Dakota
State's rotation.
All five of the Jackrabbits' start-
ers are upperclassmen, and four
are double-digit scorers.
"The thing in the mid-major
programs - and they are a legit
mid-major programrightnow - is
that they have juniors and seniors,
and they're all over the place,"
Beilein said. "We have to play like
juniors and seniors in that game."
While none of the Michigan
players made available to the
media Sunday were particularly
knowledgeable of South Dakota
State, each was well aware of
Wolter's capabilities.
"He's a great player from what
I've seen," McGary said. "He can

do anything on the court; he has
many intangibles to his game."
The man Wolters will match
up against, sophomore point
guard Trey Burke, said he's never
watched the Jackrabbits play, but
another Wolverine guard, junior
Tim Hardaway Jr., met Wolters
while the two were at last sum-
mer's Kevin Durant Skills Acad-
emy.
Though Michigan should
have a considerable home-court
advantage in the opening week-
end, Michigan State also drew

the Auburn Hills pod, and its
fans - along with most other non-
Wolverine fans - will likely be
cheering on the underdog. Hard-
away was also quick tQ note that
playing so close to home has its
drawbacks.
"It's great to be close to home,
but it can also be a negative thing
because you're so caught up in
distractions," he said. "We've just
got to do a great job at limiting our
distractions."
The Wolverines struggled
down the stretch, going just 6-6

in their last 12 games, but those
games all came against gritty Big
Ten schools. Many of the play-
ers and Beilein noted that facing
teams outside of their own confer-
encewould be refreshing.
While many teams in the Big
Ten slow the game's tempo down
and play more physically than
Michigan - especially in the post
- the Jackrabbits feature a guard-
oriented offense that likes to run
up and down, eliciting high-scor-
ing affairs, something that could
play to the Wolverines' advantage.

"That is not a style you get a
great deal in our league," Beilein
said. "We guard some of that
everyday in practice.
"They're very similar to us. I
do not know if that's good or bad
- I'm not smart enough to know
that. I do know that we better be
able to defend the three, that's for
sure."
If Michigan advances out of
Auburn Hills ant into the Sweet
Sixteen, it'll head to Arlington,
Texas' Cowboy Stadium, likely to
face top-seeded Kansas.

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily SportsEditor
CHICAGO - After fresh-
man forward Mitch McGary's
10-point, 11-rebound perfor-
mance in Thursday's game
against Penn State, Michigan
coach John Beilein was faced
with the same question he's
had to answer numerous times
throughout the season: McGary
or redshirt junior forward Jor-
dan Morgan?
Morgan has had his share of
struggles just like the rest of the
Wolverine big men, but the red-
shirt junior got in foul trouble
early against the Nittany Lions.
He played just 10 minutes on
Thursday, and with McGary's
dominance in the paint, Beilein
had to grapple with the decision
on whether to swap McGary for
Morgan in the starting lineup.
"We talk about the roster and
rotation every day," Beilein said
after Thursday's game. "We'll
probably do that again. But a
change, I'mnot going to say we're
going to do it or not going to do

After playing two games in

Lane walkoff
highlights Judi
Garman Classic

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
As Michigan students celebrat-
ed an early St. Patrick's Day across
campus Saturday, Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins and the softball
team celebrated in their own right,
winning in extra-inning, walk-off
fashion against North Carolina
State - and they didn't need any
Irish luck.
The 1-0 win over the Wolfpack
capped off a four-win weekend at
the Judi Garman Classic in Fuller-
ton, Calif., where No. 15 Michigan
beat three ranked teams - No. 2
Arizona State, No. 14 Arizona and
No.18 Washington. Strong perfor-
mances on the mound and timely
hitting helped the Wolverines (21-
7) execute their most successful
weekend of the season.
"I really felt what we got bet-
ter at was persevering and staying
even-keeled," Hutchins said. "We
kept grindingit out and going after
it, and we didn't let ourselves get
in our ownway."
In the last game of the week-
end against North Carolina State,
sophomore pitcher Haylie Wag-
ner kept Michigan in the game by
tossing eight shutout innings and
striking out six. Offensively, the
team picked up just five hits but
scored the game's lone run in the
bottom of the eighth inning which
was enough for the win.
Junior right fielder Nicole Sap-
pingfield was put in scoring posi-
tion as part of tie-breaker rules
that place a runner on second
base to begin each extra inning.
She advanced to third on a single
off the bat of freshman shortstop
Sierra Romero which set the stage

for senior second baseman Ashley
Lane. After working the count to
2-1, Lane hit a shot to the second
baseman. Sappingfield, who was
moving on contact, beat the throw
to give the Wolverines the victory.
"(It) was a tough game, and I
was impressed by North Caro-
lina State's pitcher," Hutchins
said. "We did a great job of stay-
ing in our game and staying in the
moment and grinding it out. That's
what Division I softball is."
In another close battle, Michi-
gan downed the second-ranked
Sun Devils Friday morning, 5-4,
and then took care of business in
the afternoon, defeating No. 14
Arizona, 9-1. In the first game,
with the Wolverines down 4-3,
senior third baseman Amy Knapp
stepped to the plate with runners
on second and third. Knapp, who
batted in the seven spot for the
first time this season, drilled a 1-1
pitch up the middle to put Michi-
gan up for good. The hit was one
of six that Knapp collected on the
weekend.
"My approach was just attack,"
Knapp said. "That's been our
motto all year, just attack. And
I've really done a good job lately of
staying one-pitch focused. That's
something that (Hutchins) always
tells us to do."
In the matinee, the Wolver-
ines gave up an unearned run in
the first but exploded with the
bats later to get the run-rule vic-
tory - enforced when one team
leads by seven runs after five
innings. Michigan scored four in
the fourth, highlighted by a blast
over the left-field wall off the bat
of Romero.
The offense didn't stop there.

FILEtPHOTO/Daiy
Senior second baseman Ashley Lane broke an eight-inning stalemate with a walkoff.

In the next inning, the Wolverines
took advantage of an error, a walk
and an infield hit to load the bases.
Sophomore pitcher Sara Driesen-
ga knocked a single into left-cen-
ter for her 24th and 25th RBI on
the season. Knapp followed it up
with a base hit of her own to score
another run and extend the lead.
Michigan.picked up two more
runs in the sixth to end the game.
The Wolverines' only loss of
the weekend came on Thursday
against Virginia Tech. After blast-
ing three homers in the day's first
game against No. 18 Washington
to win 6-1, Michigan failed to pro-
duce clutch hits against the Hok-
ies.
After hitting a batter in the
fifth, Wagner gave up two singles
to let in Virginia Tech's first run.
The Hokies would add two more
in the sixth against Driesenga,
who came on in relief.
In Michigan's half of the sixth,
the offense was able to produce
only one run on a sacrifice fly after

loading the bases with one out.
In the seventh, the Wolverines
threatened to tie the game. With
one out, Lane.walked and scored
on a Knapp double two batters
later.
But Michigan was unable to
push across the tying run and fell,
3-2.
Michigan will change focus
now as it enters Big Ten play at
home on Friday. Hutchins said
she is looking forward to tough
opposition in the Big Ten this year
as well as getting to play a three-
game series against the same
team as opposed to the five-game,
multi-teamseries that the Wolver-
ines have had:
"We're still evolving, and you
evolve as a team all the way into

Without Biondi, Wolverines drop
two of three in South Carolina

Michigan struggles
after centerfielder
suffers sprained
thumb
By MAX COHEN
Daily Sports Writer
Anyone who has seen the
movie "Moneyball" knows the
importance of on-base percent-
age.
The absence of senior out-
fielder and leadoff hitter Patrick
Biondi hurt the Michigan base-
ball team as it went 1-2 at the
Chanticleer Classic in Myrtle
Beach, S.C. over the weekend.
The Michigan offense was stag-
nant all weekend with Biondi's
team-leading .493 on-base per-
centage sidelined with a sprained
thumb. It scored only nine runs
over the weekend.
Not only did the offense miss
Biondi, but it also missed injured
sophomore catcher Kevin White,
who didn't play in the last two
games of the weekend after sus-
taining an injury Friday night.
The lack of run production com-
bined with average pitching
prevented the Wolverines from
earning the sweep they wanted,
as they dropped two games to
Coastal Carolina (9-10) before
defeating Akron (2-16) on Sun-
day.
"We've got to be able to over-
come acouple of injuries," Bakich
said. "We're certainly not going
to make excuses for that."
On Friday, Michigan fell to the
.Chanticleers, 8-4, after blowing
a 3-0 first-inning lead. Coastal
Carolina made a bevy of mistakes
in, the inning including. three
errors, three wild pitches, two
walks and one hit batter, allow-
ing the Wolverines to score three
runs while only recording one
hit.
"That game was right where
we wanted it to be, and we let
them back in after they gifted us
a few runs," Bakich said.

mitting five errors .in the game,
Coastal Carolina used two big

innings to recover and break the
game open. The Chanticleers
knocked ' around Michigan's
pitching, as they recorded 12 hits
and capitalized on the six free
passes and one hit-by-pitch.
Saturday's game had a very
different feel, though, as Coastal
Carolina shut down the Michi-
gan offense and built a 6-0 lead,
before the Wolverines man-
aged to score twice in the ninth
inning. After two consecutive
scoreless starts, freshman pitch-
er Evan Hill struggled, allow-
ing five earned runs in just 4.1
innings.
"No starting pitcher is going
to sustain scoreless outings,"
Bakich said. "He hadn't given up
an earned run in two starts prior
to this one, so that's just base-
ball."
Biondi's absence was espe-
cially felt on Saturday, particu-
larly when his replacement in
the leadoff spot, junior outfielder
Michael O'Neill, went 0-for-
5. The next four batters in the
Michigan lineup went 4-for-17 in
the game with only one RBI after
freshman second baseman Jacob
Cronenworth singled in the final
run of the game in the ninth.
"We just came out soft in the
first two games and really didn't
play to our potential," Cronen-

worth said.
On Sunday, the Wolverines,
failed to pull away from a Zips
team that has had few good
games this season. Michigan was
able to score two runs in the sec-
ond inning without getting a hit
after Akron pitcher Pat Dyer hit
two batters, walked another and
committed an error in the field.
Senior pitcher Ben Ballantine,
the Wolverines' starter, grinded
through 4.1 innings, allowing
two earned runs while strik-
ing out five batters and walking
two. With the game close, the
Michigan bullpen came in and
shut down Akron, allowing just
three runners to reach base in
4.2 innings. The offense contin-
ued to struggle for the Wolver-
ines until freshman shortstop
Trevor Maezes singled in sopho-
more outfielder Zach Zott to give
Michigan the 3-2 lead, which
it held for the remainder of the
game.
But the victory on Sunday
didn't make Bakich feel much
better about his team's perfor-
mance this weekend.
"The losirig part is frustrat-
ing," Bakich said. "When we
don't play to our potential, that's
really frustrating. I'm not happy
with today's win because we
didn't play well today. We didn't

play to our potential in any of the
three games."
