Members of the University 

of 
Michigan’s 
Senate 

Assembly passed a resolution 
on Monday brought forth 
by 
the 
Academic 
Affairs 

Advisory 
Committee 

regarding salary cuts as a 
way to demote faculty. The 
meeting was also a chance 
for the assembly to hear 
last remarks from outgoing 
Provost 
Martha 
Pollack 

and 
initial 
remarks 
from 

incoming 
Interim 
Provost 

Paul Courant, a public policy 
professor.

The 
faculty 
began 
the 

meeting by taking a closer 
look at the AAAC resolution 
written in December, which 
condemns the University for 
effectively demoting faculty 
members by cutting their 
salaries without due process 
and calls for this to change.

The AAAC, after being 

notified 
of 
several 
cases 

of these incidents at the 
University, 
decided 
any 

reduction of a tenured faculty 
member’s salary qualifies as 
a demotion, and entitles the 
member to the due processes 
the Board of Regents bylaw 
outlines. None of the cases 
were specified, but it was 
noted that this problem was 
most common in the Schools 
of Medicine, Dentistry and 
Pharmacy.

The Regents’ Bylaw 5.09 

outlines 
the 
due 
process 

procedure for dismissal or 
demotion, but the assembly 
argued the document does not 
specify what is considered a 
demotion.

John Lehman, a Senate 

Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University Affairs member 

and 
professor 
of 
biology, 

presented the resolution to 
the 
Senate 
Assembly 
and 

urged them to vote in favor of 
it. He mentioned that SACUA 
members had debated the 
resolution during their last 
meeting, and decided to keep 
the resolution’s definition of 

demotion to only a pay cut 
to limit technicalities and 
confusion.

“We know well that there 

are other methods invoked 
by unit administrators that 
some of you might regard 
as constructive demotions,” 
Lehman 
said. 
“Assigning 

Of

according to a new University 
of Michigan study.

According to the Centers 

for 
Disease 
Control 
and 

Prevention, 
obesity 
in 
the 

United States has become a 
major public health concern 
among all races and genders, 
with more than one-third of all 
adults affected.

Yet while previous research 

indicated depression as result 
of obesity was common among 
all 
races, 
new 
University 

research 
shows 
between 

the two races, obesity only 
positively 
correlates 
with 

depression for white women, 
particularly those over the age 
of 50.

The University of Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University 
History 
has 

outlined a process to consider a 
building name change request 
due to students questioning 
buildings named after those 
who have not openly supported 
civil rights or equality, as well 
as the lack of buildings named 
after women and minorities.

The 
new 
policy 
comes 

in light of the University’s 
bicentennial, which celebrates 
and examines the University’s 
history. On campus, there are 
few buildings named after 
females and only one named 
after an African American: the 
Trotter Multicultural Center.

The policy also comes after 

the 
University’s 
Board 
of 

Regents 
approved 
changing 

the name of the Trotter Center 
to the Bernstein-Bendit Hall 
last Spring after Regent Mark 
Bernstein (D) and his wife 
Rachel Bendit offered a $3 
million gift for the center. 
Many students protested the

A GroupMe chat group 

for 
prospective 
University 

of 
Michigan 
freshmen 

students became a hotbed of 
controversy on Jan. 20 after 
white individuals messaged 
a racist slur and bigoted 
comments 
at 
Black 
and 

minority group members.

According to screenshots 

tweeted by a Black prospective 
student Kennedy DuBose, a 
white individual named Alex 
Whitley commented “N----
RS ARE THE WORST YOU 
KNOW” on the #Victors2021 
group 
chat. 
In 
an 
email 

interview with the Daily, 
DuBose said she could not 
speculate as to why Whitley, 
who claimed to be an admitted 
student, used the slur.

“Im (sic) not sure how the 

feud started … I just came 
back to the chat to ‘n---ers are 
the worst,’ ” she wrote. “And 
nobody addressed him. It was 
out of the blue.”

When 
other 
members, 

including Kennedy, started 
calling 
him 
out 
on 
his 

messages, 
Whitley 
and 
a 

few 
sympathizers 
began 

personally attacking DuBose. 
The 
chat’s 
administrators 

eventually removed DuBose 
and other Black individuals 
from the chat, including some 
who were not involved in the 
debate, she said.

However, 
University 

spokeswoman 
Kim 

Broekhuizen said there is no 
evidence that either of the 
individuals in the chat are 
affiliated with the University 
whatsoever. 
Whitley 
did 

not respond to an interview 
request by the Daily.

“There are no students 

— or recently admitted — 
in our records by the name 
Ashley Wellington or Alex 
Whitley,” Broekhuizen said. 
“We have no evidence that 
these individuals have any 
affiliation with the University 
of Michigan.”

Author speaks to sold out Rackham Auditorium as part of MLK day symposium event

Activist and author Shaun 

King 
sold 
out 
Rackham 

Auditorium 
Monday 
night 

for his speech exploring the 
mixed reactions on campus 
following the 2016 presidential 
election. The event was hosted 
by the Office of Academic 
Multicultural Initiatives as part 
of the annual Martin Luther 
King Jr. Symposium.

Austin 
McCoy, 
a 
Mellon 

Humanities 
Postdoctoral 

Fellow at the University of 
Michigan, opened by talking 
about activist groups on campus 
and 
his 
goal 
to 
empower 

marginalized people. McCoy 
ended by saying “Black Lives 
Matter,” “Black Queer Lives 
Matter” and other variations 
of the slogan, receiving cheers 
from the audience in response.

King then began his speech 

by describing his hopes to 
instill new perspectives in the 
socially active audience.

“I am not necessarily here to 

inspire, because I believe in a 
lot of ways that you are already 
inspired,” King said. “Tonight 
I am here to really teach you a 
lesson that will give you a new 
lens through which to see the 
world.”

King described what he felt 

after viewing the video of Eric 
Garner, a Black man strangled 
by the police in New York in July 
2014. The video, which showed 
a 
police 
officer 
strangling 

Garner despite Garner telling 
the officer he couldn’t breathe, 
went viral, sparking protests 

around the country.

“What I saw was Officer 

Daniel 
Pantaleo, 
NYPD, 

choking Eric Garner to death,” 
King said, “It shook me.”

King came to understand the 

killings of Garner and other 
young Black men by the police 
through the work of German 
historian Leopold von Ranke, 
who believed humanity was 
not 
steadily 
progressing 
as 

most people believe, but rather 
progress within humanity was 
much more varied and went

Saturday, hundreds of students 

“flew” into the Rogel Ballroom in 

the University of Michigan Union 

for the fifth annual Yule Ball, hosted 

by the Michigan Quidditch Team.

The Yule Ball was a key plot 

point introducing the concept of 

romance between characters in 

“Harry Potter and the Goblet of 

Fire.” It is also an iconic event to 

“Potterheads,” as the fans are called.

According to the event’s 

Facebook page, the party included a 

Great Hall-style feast, reminiscent 

of the magical dinners of the 

series. Guests are sorted into 

Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff or 

Ravenclaw, danced to music or had 

their fortunes told. “Formal dress” 

constituted that of the wizarding 

world, rather than that of campus. 

The team encouraged its guests to 

appear as they would if they were to 

enter the Hogwarts castle.

“Dress is formal, so break out 

your wands and dress robes and 

come ready to party!” the event page 

states.

The event sold out on Saturday 

afternoon, which sparked a stream 

of frantic posts on the Facebook 

page. Many prospective guests 

offered to buy extra tickets at more 

than face value, and some expressed 

disappointment at the prospect of 

missing out on the Yule Ball.

Yule Ball-goers also had the 

opportunity to contribute to the 

music selection of the event. The 

event’s DJ, Kinesiology sophomore 

Kailey Danaher, offered up her 

playlist to the masses.

“Want to hear your favorite 

song at the Yule Ball?” she wrote. 

“Think you can DJ? Well, you 

can’t DJ, that’s my job. But you can 

help me by adding songs to this 

collaborative playlist to make Yule 

Ball even more magical.”

At its completion, the MQ Yule 

Ball 2017 Spotify playlist included 

hits such as “Closer” by The 

Chainsmokers, “Ignition (Remix)” 

by R. Kelly, “Hips Don’t Lie” by 

Shakira and “Stacy’s Mom” by 

Fountains of Wayne.

The Michigan Quidditch Team 

expressed its gratitude for the 

overwhelming turnout at its biggest 

fundraiser of the year.

“Thank you everyone for 

making the Fifth Annual Yule Ball 

an amazing success!” the post said. 

“Hope to see you all next year!”

Michigan League on Friday.

at exploring the effects of 
a high body mass index on 
depression across race and 
gender. 
Moreover, 
Assari’s 

study looked to find causations 
between 
the 
effects 
of 

sustained 
physical 
activity 

and depression in the different 
groups.

Assari used data from a 

University-produced 
Health 

and Retirement Study, which 
took a representative sample 
of Americans over the age of 
50 from 2004-2010 to measure 
depressive symptoms across 
individuals 
who 
presented 

BMIs 
that 
are 
considered 

to be obese. The research 
focused only on Black and 
white 
Americans 
to 
make 

generalizations 
about 
both 

populations.

Assari 
explained 
his 

research 
helps 
show 
that 

sustained 
psychological 

effects from sustained physical 
conditions are not mutually 
exclusive from one’s race and 
gender.

“Medical 
education 
has 

assumed that every risk factor 
is constant among groups,” 
Assari 
said. 
“My 
research 

shows that this is true when all 
groups are pooled together, but 
when you divide the groups by 
their history, the effects of risk 
factors are different.”

Assari 
noted 
the 

presentation 
of 
depression 

was directly correlated to the 
individual’s personal history 
and living conditions. One 
example Assari used was that 
many Black men grew up very 
differently from white women.

“The history of Black men, 

for example, which is filled 
with exposure, is extremely 
different from that of white 
females,” he said. “Because 
of their norms, white females 
cannot afford to be obese, 
unless 
they 
are 
depressed 

because 
of 
the 
mental 

pressure associated with their 
obesity. On the other hand, 
Black men cannot afford to 
be that sensitive because of 
all the exposure that comes 
from factors such as police, 
unemployment, discrimination 
and racism. They don’t share 
the same luxury of being 

depressed by their obesity.”

The 
conclusion 
Assari 

presents 
brings 
a 
new 

perspective 
into 
how 

health 
intervention 
should 

be 
effectively 
handled 
for 

individuals of different races 
and genders.

Julia 
Carter, 
a 
graduate 

student 
at 
the 
University 

of 
Pittsburgh, 
worked 
on 

the 
research 
under 
the 

mentorship of Assari as part 
of the University’s Summer 
Immersion Program. Carter 
discussed the importance of 
the research in terms of how 
it could change health and 
psychological treatment.

“The significance of this 

research is that the association 

between sustained BMI 
and 
depression 
is 
not 

uniform across race and 
gender,” 
Carter 
said. 

“Therefore, health care 
and programs such as 
weight loss interventions 
and 
psychological 
care 

should be tailored to the 
target population in order 
to be more effective.”

This study is related to 

previous work conducted 
by 
Assari 
in 
2016 
in 

which he concluded that 
education is a risk factor 
for depression in Black 
men. While education is 
often thought to bring 
happiness 
and 
strong-

mindedness 
to 
many 

people, it has a different 
effect on the psychological 
well-beings of Black men.

This recent study ties 

in with Assari’s larger 
research project aimed at 
portraying the resilience 
of different social groups 
and the health effects 
associated with different 
risk factors.

AARON BAKER/Daily

The Movement Dance group practices in Angell Hall on Monday. 

punitive teaching roles … 
moving office space, and so on 
… But in each of those cases, a 
value judgment would have to 
be made regarding whether or 
not a demotion had occurred. 
We 
chose 
to 
keep 
the 

resolution short and simple, 
rather than to anticipate all 
the hypothetical abuses that 
could be imposed. I urge you 
to adopt this resolution as 
offered.”

Lehman then offered to 

answer questions the Senate 
Assembly may have. John 
Ellis, a history professor at 
UM-Flint, asked whether or 
not the resolution would apply 
to the Flint and Dearborn 
campuses as well. Lehman 
and SACUA President Bill 
Schultz determined it would.

A vote was then held on the 

resolution, and it passed with 
no votes against and only one 
abstention.

Following the vote, Provost 

Martha 
Pollack 
took 
the 

floor and began her farewell 
address to the assembly by 
sharing her opinions on the 
AAAC 
resolution. 
Pollack 

felt, contrary to the assembly, 
a pay cut did not necessarily 
mean a demotion and the 

resolution would be harmful 
to tenured professors.

“In my view, performance 

is tied to salary,” Pollack said. 
“When there is persistent 
underperformance, 
that 

would be followed up by a 
negative salary increment … I 
think it’s risky at this moment 
to equate underperformance 
with 
demotion 
and 
the 

withdrawal of tenure. We’re 
at a moment in society where 
tenure is being attacked.”

Pollack, who will begin 

her 
position 
as 
president 

of 
Cornell 
University 
in 

April, then transitioned into 
her parting remarks to the 
assembly. She thanked the 
faculty for all their hard work 
as she spoke about her pride 
for the University over her 16 
years on staff.

“This 
is 
a 
really 

extraordinary 
institution,” 

Pollack 
said. 
“I’ve 
been 

reflecting on why, and of 
course, it’s the people — 
universities are nothing more 
than people — but it’s also the 
culture that the people at the 
University of Michigan create 
… It’s corny, but we use this 
phrase ‘Leaders and Best,’ 
and people take it seriously. 
When you’re working with 
someone 
else 
in 
another 

field, you know they’re going 
to be the best, and I think 
that’s something we need to 

celebrate and remember.”

Pollack also cautioned the 

group about what she felt were 
the two biggest challenges 
facing the University, and 
higher education in general, 
moving forward. She first 
stressed the importance of 
making sure the University 
stays affordable to students, 
in the face of decreasing 
state 
funding 
and 
rising 

institutional 
costs, 
which 

she referred to as “the cost 
disease.”

“The question I always get 

asked by the public, which is 
the wrong question, is ‘Why 
does tuition increase every 
year?’ ” Pollack said. “The 
right question is, ‘Why is 
tuition going up faster than 
inflation every year?’ Really, 
the two big (reasons for this) 
are declining state support 
and the cost disease. We 
know the causes, but we still 
have to find the solutions … 
My plea to all of you is that 
you take this seriously and 
work on this with us.”

The second challenge the 

University faces, and the one 
Pollack said concerns her the 
most, is how to stay relevant 
in a time when people are 
questioning the value of the 
very concept of college.

“It’s really critical that 

we 
figure 
out 
ways 
to 

address this, and I think 

that 
means 
demonstrating 

our relevance,” Pollack said. 
“We need to take the time to 
tell the story — more than we 
ever have — why (we’re) so 
important.”

After 
Pollack’s 
speech, 

Interim Provost Paul Courant 
spoke to the assembly and 
relayed his excitement to 
be stepping into the provost 
role once again. Courant was 
the University provost from 
2002 to 2005 and will act as 
interim provost when Pollack 
steps down at the end of this 
month. During his address, 
Courant 
echoed 
Pollack’s 

remarks 
about 
staying 

relevant in a changing world.

“We 
have 
to 
persuade 

better the world around us 
that what we do is really 
of extraordinary value to 
society,” Courant said. “We 
should stick with excellence 
and collaboration; it’s what 
we’re good at, and what 
constitutes the essence of the 
secret sauce that makes this a 
great institution.”

The 
Senate 
Assembly 

concluded the meeting by 
thanking both Pollack and 
Courant for their commitment 
to the University and faculty 
governance. SACUA President 
Bill Schultz presented Pollack 
with a parting gift from the 
assembly: a picture frame and 
a scarf in “Cornellian red.”

name on social media, arguing 
the change would remove the 
legacy of William Trotter, a 
known Black and civil rights 
activist. However, the gift was 
revoked three months after 
the Regents approved it, as 
Bernstein recognized student 
concerns 
for 
the 
building’s 

namesake.

Terry McDonald, the director 

of 
the 
Bentley 
Historical 

Library 
and 
chair 
of 
the 

advisory committee, developed 
a set of principles to guide 
the evaluation of whether or 
not a name change should be 
implemented.

According to McDonald in a 

University Record release, the 
complexity of such an evaluation 
causes the principles to be less 
defined than a checklist.

“We do not believe that 

historical questions about the 

names of buildings or spaces 
can be answered by means of 
a checklist,” McDonald wrote 
in the committee’s report to 
Schlissel, 
according 
to 
the 

release. 
“Indeed, 
given 
the 

nature of our institution and its 
history, such questions bring 
into play principles that already 
exist — sometimes in tension — 
with the university.”

The 
principles 
are 
based 

on 
pedagogy, 
commitment, 

contemporary 
and 
historical 

context, 
consistency 
and 

revision, among other criteria.

LSA sophomore Ayah Issa felt 

that having a more definitive 
process for renaming could 
facilitate 
more 
thoughtful 

considerations 
for 
name 

changes.

“A white man almost had 

his name on a multicultural 
building,” said Issa. “It is a big 
step out of the gray area for the 
University to implement this

Garg, 
a 
representative 
of 

Students4Justice, a coalition 
combatting racism on campus, 
said speculation on Whitley’s 
motives 
was 
unnecessary 

because of the gravity of the 
situation.

“It 
doesn’t 
matter 
the 

context, it was abhorrent,” 
Garg said. “Also, how are 
we showing that we value 
Black 
students 
and 
other 

marginalized 
students 
if 

we are allowing them to be 
subjected to this?”

DuBose 
explained 
on 

Twitter that, as she was 
trying to teach Whitley and 
others about white privilege, 
they harassed her on the 
basis of her financial award 
— DuBose secured a Fairfax 
Scholarship, or four years 
of paid tuition — to the 
University with an ACT score 
of 27.

Prospective 
student 

Kaushik Kothakonda implied 
DuBose 
was 
unqualified 

for her scholarship and she 
received an unfair advantage 
because of her race.

“Lmao 
how 
tf 
is 
Ken 

gonna be roasting everyone 
on 
‘privilege’ 
when 
she’s 

the one who got a full ride 
to Ann arbor with a 27 act,” 
Kothakonda 
wrote 
in 
the 

chat. “Is she seriously gonna 
tell me she would have gotten 
the full ride if she was white 

or asian. Affirmative action is 
privilege get your head out of 
the clouds.”

Universities and colleges 

in Michigan, however, have 
been 
barred 
from 
using 

affirmative action for the last 
10 years. The Supreme Court 
further upheld the 2006 state 
ban on affirmative action in 
a 2014 case, banning racial 
quotas or the consideration of 
applicants’ race in admissions. 

DuBose 
retorted 
on 

Twitter her credentials were 
on par with the scholarship 
requirements and amounted 
to more than her race.

“… they think the only 

reason I got my full ride there 
was because I’m black — not 
because I earned it,” DuBose 
wrote on Twitter. “I have 200+ 
hours of community service, 
I’m in 12+ extracirriculars 
(sic). Leadership position in 
each. And my essays were 
fire.”

In 
her 
Twitter 
post 

about the incident, DuBose 
specifically mentioned the 
inauguration 
of 
President 

Donald 
Trump, 
whose 

comments 
on 
groups 

including 
Blacks, 
Latinos 

and immigrants have stirred 
great controversy. Trump has 
previously 
called 
Mexican 

immigrants 
“rapists” 

and 
criminals, 
and 
has 

incorrectly 
characterized 

most Black people as living 
in impoverished inner city 
areas.

DuBose wrote on Twitter 

the 
chat 
members 
tried 

to silence her by invoking 
Trump’s 
victory 
in 
the 

elections, and also claimed 
they 
felt 
attacked 
for 

supporting the new president.

In 
the 
corresponding 

section 
of 
the 
chat, 

prospective students Matthew 
Lewis and Tyler Lubin argued 
Trump is not a racist and 
Lewis characterized DuBose 
and others as sore losers, 
according 
to 
screenshots 

posted by S4J on Facebook.

“Y’all can kick and scream 

all you want,” Lewis wrote. 
“We’re all living in Don’s 
America now.”

The 
incident 
sparked 

outrage among student groups 
on campus. Students4Justice 
began 
a 
social 
media 

awareness 
campaign 
on 

Sunday exposing Whitley and 
his sympathizers.

LSA 
sophomore 
Gabby 

McFarland, 
gender 
lead 

for S4J, wrote in an email 
interview with the Daily her 
group is currently spreading 
word about the incident and 
has contacted the Office of 
Admissions.

“We will soon be releasing 

our literature by tomorrow 
which will contain a thorough 
list of demands and further 
actions will be decided from 
there on,” McFarland wrote.

After all that has happened, 

however, DuBose continues 
to be optimistic about the 
possibility of a future at the 
University.

“I’m 
overwhelmingly 

grateful for this experience 
and I’m thankful for these 
groups that are helping me 
get justice,” she wrote. “I 
don’t really have access to 
campus right now and I don’t 
have much of a platform, but I 
really appreciate that they’re 
helping me make sure that 
UMICH 
isn’t 
represented 

poorly. 
They’re 
amazing 

people that I’ve met so far and 
I’m excited to be with them 
every step of the way, not 
only in this situation but in 
all racial discrimination in my 
future years at Michigan.”

Whitley may not be the only 

student claiming to be admitted 
coming under fire, though. A 
Twitter user named Ashley 
Wellington, 
who 
included 

“University of Michigan ‘21” 
in her profile, posted tweets 
referring to former president 
Barack Obama as a n----er 
and lynchings. Twitter users 
rallied 
against 
Wellington, 

tagging 
University 
Twitter 

accounts in an effort to revoke 
her 
admission. 
Wellington 

has since deleted her account, 
though Broekhuizen said the 
University’s social media team 
is monitoring the situation, but 
could not confirm the Twitter 
account was run by an admitted 
student.

“We can’t find these names 

in our system at all,” she said. 
“At this point, there is no 
evidence for us to determine 
they might be affiliated with the 
University.”

through highs and lows.

According to King, von Ranke 

is credited with compiling the 
first comprehensive history of 
the world. Today, he said, the 
most common mistake humans 
often make is equating human 
progress 
with 
technological 

progress.

King applied von Ranke’s 

theory 
to 
the 
recent 
2016 

election, agreeing that humanity 
is 
not 
a 
straight 
path 
to 

advancement, and the election 
of Donald Trump as president 
shows a dip in the progression.

Reactions to the election of 

Trump have been mixed on 
campus. Student organizations 
such as BAMN — the Coalition 
to Defend Affirmative Action, 
Integration 
and 
Immigrant 

Rights and Fight for Equality 
By Any Means Necessary — 
recently led a march protesting 
Trump.

“Humanity is not this steady 

inclining 
progression 
where 

people are just getting better and 
better and better and better,” 
King said. “Humanity is instead 
of series of peaks and valleys.”

King said much of the surprise 

people felt after incidents such 
as 
the 
trans-Atlantic 
slave 

trade, the Holocaust and the 
Rwandan genocide came from 
this falsehood that humanity is 
constantly progressing.

“For months, maybe years, 

we have walked around deeply 
confused 
at 
what 
we 
are 

experiencing because what we 
are experiencing doesn’t feel 
like the way we thought 2016 and 
2017 would feel,” King said, in 
regards to the negative reaction 
to Trump’s win as president.

The event also touched on 

the 
history 
of 
institutional 

discrimination 
against 
Black 

people in the United States. 
The high incarceration rates in 
the United States — especially 
among African Americans — 
King added, is largely due to the 
Nixon administration’s goal of 
criminalizing Blackness without 
explicitly announcing it.

“I hear people all the time say 

our justice system is broken,” 
King said. “What they tell us is 
that this system is not broken, 
but it was built to function this 
way.”

King reiterated that the peaks 

and valleys in history have 
caused things such as the end of 
slavery, the creation of the Ku 
Klux Klan and the election of a 
Black president.

Social 
Work 
student 

Dominique Hollis, who attended 
the event, said groups of people 

need to come together in order 
to 
overcome 
the 
dip 
King 

described.

“We need to expand this 

conversation 
to 
recognize 

that while yes, people of color 
are greatly disenfranchised … 
dissociating from members of 
the white community who are 
reaching out of desperation at 
times when they vote for people 
like Trump does not get us out 
of the dip,” Hollis said. “It only 
gets us deeper because we are 
not involving those parties in 
the conversation.”

If people don’t act like society 

is in a dip, according to King 
society will never emerge from 
it.

“Innovation 
disturbed 
the 

primary power structure and in 
response to the innovation, we 
are now living in the dip,” King 
said.

Rackham 
student 
Paula 

Luu said she had different 
expectations for King’s speech 
following the Women’s March 
and felt disappointed by the lack 
of answers.

“I came here wanting to 

better understand the how: how 
movements have been moved 
forwards in the past, and how 
we can build off, what I feel, is 
a lot of national energy,” Luu 
said. “I don’t feel like I got that 
today.”

W

ith Valentine’s Day 
less than a month 
away and the heart-

shaped 
boxes 
of 
chocolate 

appearing on the shelves of 
Walgreens, 
I 
find 

myself 
reminded 

of the time when 
I 
would 
spend 

countless 
hours 

perusing 
aisle 

upon aisle for the 
perfect box for my 
then-girlfriend. 
As a bachelor who 
experiences 
the 

common 
fear 
of 

finding 
himself 

dateless for Feb. 14, I take 
solace in the fact that I no 
longer bear the weight of my 
previous relationship upon 
my shoulders.

In 
the 
several 
months 

since the breakup, I have 
discovered 
many 
positive 

aspects to being unattached. 
Singles 
have 
the 
freedom 

and flexibility to not have to 
say good night or look after a 
certain somebody or feel the 
need to ask permission for a 
night out with friends sans their 
significant other, to name a few. 
Most 
importantly 
however, 

being single grants you the 
right to freely indulge your 
own time and self-investment 
to the nth degree; you get to 
be “unapologetically selfish.”

Finding the right partner 

is one of the most challenging 
endeavors that many of us 
partake in, though we persist 
with it because successfully 
doing 
so 
can 
be 
very 

rewarding. 
Some, 
however, 

believe differently. Courtney 
Porf from HerCampus offers 
a 
particularly 
interesting 

perspective to gain insight 
from: “I think that college is 
the best time to be single. It’s 
where we’re supposed to be 
exploring and diving into our 
personal pool of interests, and 
it’s really the last time we have 
no serious financial obligations 
or commitments and can be 
unapologetically selfish.”

Let’s delve into this notion 

of 
being 
“unapologetically 

selfish.” The concept speaks to 
the idea that you don’t have to 
feel guilty for doing nice things 
for yourself, such as eating 
out or impulse buying that 
cardigan from your favorite 
brand. Being “unapologetically 
selfish” 
occurs 
when 
you 

decide to splurge on yourself 
in some capacity, whether it 
is financially or simply doing 
something that benefits you 

exclusively. 
When 
you 
are 

“unapologetically 
selfish,” 

you don’t have to apologize 
to your significant other for 
treating yourself, because he 

or she is out of the 
picture. You don’t 
have to buy someone 
food because you 
want 
to 
do 
so 

for yourself. The 
only 
person 
you 

have to answer to 
for your actions is 
yourself. 
Did 
you 

want 
No 
Thai? 

Yes, so you bought 
some for yourself. 

Unapologetic 
selfishness 
is 

best experienced when single, 
when you can serve yourself 
to endless delight.

The concept of unapologetic 

selfishness 
transcends 
the 

mere material. It also speaks 
to your ability to have the 
freedom to choose how you 
spend your time. While single, 
you have no obligation to spend 
any amount of time with any 
given person, freeing you of 
responsibilities for anything 
not pertaining to your own 
personal matters. Instead of 
having to go on vacation with 
that girlfriend or boyfriend, 
you can study abroad, or take a 
day trip to a city you’ve never 
been to before, or simply read 
a 
book. 
Such 
indulgences 

sometimes contribute to long-
term self-growth and maturity.

Beyond 
the 
liberty 
to 

choose to be uninhibitedly 
self-serving, 
being 
single 

also 
provides 
you 
with 

the opportunity to pursue 
intrapersonal 
growth. 
You 

only really know yourself when 
you spend time alone. College, 
for many, is a time of tremendous 
growth: intellectually, socially, 
emotionally 
and 
physically 

(hello, 
freshman 
15). 
This 

growth occurs in a rather small 
time frame: four years. When 
you spend every Saturday with 
your sweetheart instead of 
doing homework or spending 
time 
trying 
to 
build 
new 

friendships, 
you 
limit 
the 

opportunities 
you 
have 
to 

grow in those areas. Strong 
friendships often last forever, 
whereas even the strongest 
of romantic relationships in 
college typically fail to last 
for reasons that range from 
differences in career trajectory 
to the distinct development of 
your social circles.

While being single provides 

a college student tremendous 
freedom, collegiate romance is 

not without benefits. You never 
have to open Tinder to find a 
“cuddle buddy,” or think about 
who you’re going to ask to 
semi-formal because everyone 
you would ask either is busy or 
going with someone else. Most 
importantly, however, you get 
the opportunity to develop 
your emotional capacity, which 
will serve you well later in life. 
You get to look at your darling 
in the eyes and say “I love you” 
and learn what it means to care 
about someone in this capacity.

Those of you who haven’t 

yet had a serious relationship 
needn’t worry; you will have 
plenty of time to live out that 
experience long after your 
college days are behind you 
(or perhaps you may still meet 
someone who you seriously date 
in college!). When pursuing 
a 
romantic 
relationship, 
it 

is important that a) both 
parties are prepared for the 
commitment and b) both parties 
are in the same emotional place 
so there isn’t a disconnect in 
the emotional give and take 
that occurs between couples. 
Because this isn’t often the 
case for those in college, being 
single in college may allow you 
to get more out of your four 
years in the aforementioned 
areas than if you spend them 
attached to another person.

Moreover, 
remaining 

uncuffed 
gives 
you 
the 

chance to find yourself and 
develop who you are so when 
you meet your Mr. or Mrs. 
Wonderful, you can handle that 
responsibility with grace and 
you are each two whole parts 
individually rather than two 
halves making yourself whole. 
When you reach that point, 
you will have had your chance 
to be unapologetically selfish, 
and will thus have the capacity 
to accept the responsibilities 
and 
privileges 
of 
being 

romantically 
attached 
to 

another person. So as you sit at 
your table with a glass of wine 
and Nat King Cole’s “L-O-V-E” 
plays overhead while doe-eyed 
couples hold hands, saying “I 
love you” and waltzing around 
you, remember to enjoy your 
unapologetic selfishness in this 
moment, and know that you 
will eventually meet someone 
who knows all your dance 
moves, inside and out. And 
they won’t make you pay for the 
wedding champagne.

O

ver the past eight years, 
frustration with partisan 
gridlock has reached an 

all-time high. The U.S. Congress’s 
overall approval rating 
has plummeted from 
a peak of 84 percent 
in 2001 to a dismal 19 
percent in 2017.

While Republicans 

and 
Democrats 

bickered, the average 
American’s 
life 

expectancy fell for 
the first time in over 
two 
decades 
and 

deaths 
by 
opioid 

overdose rose by more than 72 
percent. In many parts of the 
country, economic conditions 
worsened after the recession, 
even as the country as a whole 
recovered. 
The 
dearth 
of 

opportunities in some rural 
areas has ignited severe — and 
warranted — anxieties about 
the future of cultures and 
communities in these locales.

While the media heralded 

our return to pre-recession 
unemployment 
rates, 
rising 

inequality 
sparked 
feelings 

of desperation in parts of the 
country where former President 
Barack Obama’s “Hope and 
Change” seemed like unfulfilled 
promises.

In 
this 
environment, 

President Donald Trump — the 
blusterous outsider promising 
to “Make America Great Again” 
— managed to convince enough 
voters in electorally-important 
states that he could finally 
deliver change on their behalf. 
To these voters, Trump was a 
rock through the window in 
the shiny, inaccessible halls of 
government, a wake-up call to 
the arrogant elite who had left 
them behind.

The majority of voters didn’t 

buy into Trump’s promises. 
He lost the popular vote by 
nearly 3 million and he entered 
the White House as the least 
popular incoming president in 
at least 40 years.

Trump’s proposed mandate 

—to the extent that he has one 
at all — is a mandate for change. 
Many of Trump’s supporters 
expressed justified anger at 
the lack of government action 
in addressing the social and 
economic 
issues 
that 
face 

distressed regions.

Yet 
the 
policy 
proposals 

Trump promoted as solutions 
to these problems — notably 
trade 
protectionism 
and 

stricter immigration laws and 
enforcement — are likely to hurt 
the economy as a whole without 
meaningfully 
improving 
the 

lives of the average 
American worker.

By 
instituting 
a 

border tax or other 
trade-limiting 
proposals 
he 
has 

proposed, 
Trump 

could 
in 
practice 

hurt 
the 
U.S. 

manufacturing sector. 
Every dollar’s worth 
of Mexican exports 
sent to the United 

States is manufactured using 40 
cents worth of inputs from the 
United States taxing Mexican 
goods at the border. This would 
pay for Trump’s infamous wall 
as he proposed, but it could 
actually cost United States jobs 
at the firms that produce the 
inputs used in Mexican goods, 
should 
Mexico 
predictably 

retaliate with a similar tax. 

Limiting trade is unlikely to 

significantly cap job losses in 
manufacturing. The majority 
of these job losses occurred 
because 
of 
automation 
and 

technology, which will continue 
to pose a greater risk to the 
American working class in the 
coming years by threatening to 
replace a predicted 45 percent of 
tasks currently done by humans.

A greater emphasis on — and 

more funding for — training 
for displaced workers, as well 
as better math and science 
education in public schools, 
can do more to help employees 
compete and thrive in the 
changing economy.

Thus 
far, 
Trump 
has 

misdirected his attention to 
bringing back jobs that have 

already left or been automated. 
Instead, he should focus on 
creating new jobs. By increasing 
funding 
for 
basic 
science 

research and expanding tax 
incentives for innovation, the 
government 
could 
spur 
the 

creation of new jobs, even if they 
can’t bring back old ones.

Additionally, both tax and 

health care reform could help 
struggling workers take home 
more of the money they do 
earn.

Yet, in order to be effective, 

these policies must be carefully 
designed 
and 
implemented. 

In 
a 
political 
environment 

demanding immediate change 
and a 24/7 news cycle that 
scrutinizes 
each 
political 

action 
(or 
lack 
thereof), 

the 
patience 
that 
quality 

policymaking requires will be 
hard to come by.

Already, 
the 
Senate 
has 

taken action toward repealing 
Obama’s 
health 
care 
law 

without 
introducing 
a 

replacement bill. This kind 
of rash decision-making may 
appease supporters who, after 
years of gridlock, want to see 
swift 
congressional 
action, 

but it is unlikely to produce 
the meaningful change that 
struggling Americans need.

If 
Republicans 
want 
to 

maintain the inroads they made 
into traditionally blue states 
in the 2016 election, they need 
to institute policies that will 
produce tangible improvements 
in the lives of those voters. Hasty 
lawmaking may score political 
points in the short term, but 
it is unlikely to deliver the 
change that voters demanded by 
electing an outsider promising 
to shake up the status quo.

Trump entered the White 

House with both a Republican 
House 
and 
Senate. 
Instead 

of 
ram-rodding 
through 
a 

conservative 
agenda 
in 
his 

first 90 days, Trump would be 
wise to work with Congress 
to pass thoughtful, innovative 
policies to help working-class 
Americans. While this may take 
longer than headline-grabbing 
actions 
like 
an 
immediate 

“Obamacare” repeal, taking the 
time to enact policies likely to 
make meaningful change would 
help both Trump’s approval 
numbers and the country as a 
whole.

When age is just a number

MICHELLE PHILLIPS | COLUMN

A

ge does not mean much 
in regard to who you 
are as a person. Sure, 

it means a lot for your physical 
development as a human being 
in the early stages of your life, 
but it should not hinder one’s 
credibility. There comes a certain 
point when physical experience 
in a certain trade trumps your 
biological age.

Recently, I went skiing for the 

first time with two of my friends. 
As we were inching down the 
bunny hill on our stomachs 
watching seven-year-olds glide 
past us, we thought, “If they 
can do it, so can we!” We were 
wrong. Just because we were 
older than many of the other 
skiers on the hill did not mean 
we were entitled to being better 
than them. Though we have had 
more experience living life, that 
did not mean we had a right to 
know how to ski.

Just because you are older 

than someone does not mean 
you 
have 
an 
unexplained 

advantage over younger people 
in any ability. It can be argued 
that in any stage of life, we 
should not be defined by our age.

Too many times, we define 

ourselves 
by 
numbers. 
We 

categorize ourselves by our age, 
weight, test scores and wealth. 

While plenty of these numbers 
have been shown to correlate 
with certain outcomes, we do not 
have to let those outcomes define 
our own personal desires and 
our perceptions of our abilities 
to achieve goals.

It is a common discussion in 

today’s world that we cannot let 
labels define us. We live our lives 
trying to fit a socially constructed 
model that potentially changes 
our perspectives and morals 
as a result. Most people do not 
recognize age as a harmful label. 
I think that many times, it’s 
not; it shows how long you have 
been on this earth, and backs 
up an argument about what you 
have done with your time here. 
However, there are instances 
when we characterize ourselves 
by our age, ultimately restricting 
us from opportunities.

If we limit ourselves to a 

perception that is constructed 
by someone else’s image of us, 
we will live a life of comparison 
and unhappiness. More often 
than not, external perceptions 
based on age cloud our own self-
perceptions.

There is a shocking feeling 

when you realize the guy you 
have been hitting on at the bar 
is four years younger than you 
and a sense of comfort when 
meeting someone who is the 
same age as you. When we learn 
someone’s age, something that 

cannot always be determined 
by appearance, we have an 
automatic instinct that changes 
our perceptions.

We should be more vigilant 

in 
these 
interactions 
and 

judgments 
surrounding 
our 

age and question those who 
are judgmental of such an 
insignificant number. We have 
put a societal value on numbers 
because 
of 
the 
traditional 

beliefs and judgments that 
have been present throughout 
our society for years and it 
is up to us to change how we 
represent them.

There is a famous saying 

that goes, “with age comes 
wisdom.” However, I disagree. 
In order to gain wisdom, we 
must immerse ourselves in 
a 
stimulating 
culture 
that 

pushes us to dig deeper into our 
thoughts and questions. True 
passion sparks from a genuine 
interest in something and that 
flame should never die out 
simply because someone is “too 
young” or “not as experienced.” 
To 
echo 
another 
famous 

saying, “age is just a label.” It 
represents how long we have 
been living, but has no relation 
to all we can accomplish and 
learn on this planet.

Masterfully measured 
sounds of ‘La La Land’

Film’s score blends influences from historical genres into a 
stirring, and effective, emotional cinematic soundscape

Part of the mastery of Damien 

Chazelle’s “La La Land” is its 
timing. When Sebastian takes Mia 
— played by Ryan 
Gosling and Emma 
Stone, respectively 
— to a jazz club 
after she declares 
her hatred for the 
genre, 
there’s 
a 

fascinating 
scene 

where 
Sebastian 

narrates 
the 

excitement of the 
art while the piece, “Herman’s 
Habit,” 
perfectly 
directs 
his 

expressions near the tail end. A 
trumpet blares as he moves his 
fists together, while the tempo 
speeds up as he raises his arms. It’s 
seamless and riveting to watch, as 
the music and the film play off one 
another. Each are granted equal 
respect.

A friend of mine described “La 

La Land” as a film by someone who 
purely, absolutely loves film. It’s 
tone is starry-eyed and stunned, 
even at its most devastating.

The same should be said of the 

soundtrack and the score. While 
Chazelle has garnered the majority 
of the limelight, Justin Hurwitz, 
who composed the music for 
Chazelle’s two previous projects, 
deserves 
similar 
recognition 

here. He has produced one of 
the most inventive, yet nostalgic 
soundtracks of the last decade.

In a recent Reddit Q&A, 

Hurwitz 
answered 
questions 

about the genealogy of his work — 
the inspirations he holds closest. 
He praised John Williams (“Star 
Wars,” “Jaws”), Michel Legrand 
(“The Umbrellas of Cherbourg”) 
and Nino Rota (“The Godfather”), 
some of the most legendary names 
in film score composition. These 
are artists who know that a scene 
might blow by, but a score, and a 
good one at that, will stick with you 
forever. Anyone who’s heard the 
piercing violins of “Pyscho,” the 
atmospheric, trumpeting gloom 
of “Chinatown” or the joyful 

tune of “Singin’ in the Rain” will 
immediately recognize the score, 
even if some finer plot details get 
lost on the way.

But 
Hurwitz 
also 
traces 

his 
development 
to 
classical 

compositions of the 19th and 20th 
centuries, something that sets 

the “La La Land” 
soundtrack apart. 
Like the narrative 
of the film, he 
weaves in music 
from some earlier 
traditions, 
most 

notably the solo 
piano 
nocturne. 

The 
soundtrack 

recalls 
iconic 

pieces in the form, like John Field’s 
“Nocturne No. 2 in C Minor,” and 
even more directly the titan of 
the nocturne, Frédéric Chopin. 
The nearly formless ache of his 
“Nocturne Op. 27 No. 2” and his 
gloriously sad “Nocturne Op. 9 
No. 2” both feel at the front of 
mind, and we can thank those 
traditions 
for 
inspiring 
the 

centerpiece of this soundtrack, 
“Mia and Sebastian’s Theme.” It 
drives both the film and the score, 
and it transcends the typical film-
soundtrack relationship. Think of 
the way “As Time Goes By” drives 
“Casablanca,” or how Chopin’s 
“Nocturne in C-Sharp Minor” 
dominates “The Pianist.” Five 
years past, the opening chords 
of “Theme” pull Mia right back 
to a past life, clear as a dream. 
In twenty, whether we’re living 
in 
a 
barren 
post-apocalyptic 

wasteland or within uncanny 
white picket fences, I’ll hear those 
chords and be drawn right back to 
the theatre I first heard them in. 
There’s an astounding memory in 
melody, one that grips the mind in 
inexplicable ways.

It’s an interesting choice for 

Hurwitz to use this theme to signal 
romance. Particularly in the 21st 
century, love songs have become 
synonymous with upbeat, joyful 
expressions. It’s an exuberant 
hook, or a sweet croon. This 
theme, and the inspiration it draws 
from, is far from that — its F-Sharp 
minor key isn’t necessarily a 
happy one. That slower, sadder 

representation of love hints at 
something that earlier love songs 
have long done, associating love 
with pain, sadness and loss. Look 
at one of the most popular love 
songs ever: Elvis Presley’s “Can’t 
Help Falling in Love.” Love in 
this instance is a longing, an 
ache, rather than a spritely dance. 
With this association, Hurwitz 
has grounded the “La La Land” 
soundtrack in the past. This is not 
your average musical.

His genius, though, is when he 

can weave these tradition-heavy 
pieces in with his more modern 
inspirations, and nowhere is that 
better represented than in the 
film’s effective penultimate track, 
“Epilogue.” It’s the emotional core 
of “La La Land,” and it stands as 
a towering work of modern film 
composition, never mind that 
it accompanies one of the most 
powerful third acts of the last 
decade. Gliding from the smooth 
nocturne of “Mia & Sebastian’s 
Theme” into the latter-section 
of “Planetarium,” bouncing into 
the trumpets of “Another Day Of 
Sun,” whirling to a heavenly choir 
and finally landed at a transition 
from “City of Stars” back to the 
beginning chords of “Theme,” it 
is modern in the most modern 
sense. There’s a spiral of decades 
and centuries, of traditional jazz, 
classical piano, musical show-
tunes and John William’s inspired 
scoring, and it fits together 
wonderfully.

A common complaint about the 

film is that its main voices, Stone 
and Gosling, are not the most 
awe-inspiring singers. On tracks 
like “City of Stars” Gosling can 
be slightly uninteresting, though 
Stone fares better, particularly 
on the arresting “Audition” and 
in the musical back-and-forth of 
“A Lovely Night.” But while the 
actors are the film’s foreground, 
they’re more like contributing 
voices in a choir on the soundtrack. 
The musical composition here is 
impressive to the point that the 
singing feels minor, both in key 
and function. It’s immediately 
approachable 
and 
instantly 

escapist. “La La Land” is fantasy, 
yes, but a necessary one.

Foxygen fails its ambitions

Foxygen is a two-piece band 

who 
has 
been 
consistently 

putting out a weird blend of indie 
and classic rock for their last three 
albums. They’re famous for 
relaxed songs, singing about 
LA and their biggest hit “San 
Francisco.” 
But 

on their newest 
project, the duo 
have left the more 
summery 
sound 

for 
something 

more 
serious, 

both lyrically and musically.

There is no denying Hang is 

ambitious, and a complete change 
of pace from their past. Foxygen 
have existed for 10 years, 
starting when Jonathan Rado 
and Sam France were just 15 
years old. In that time the pair 
have been turning out new 
music consistently, whether as 
LPs on a label or through several 
self-released 
singles. 
Although 

their 
discography 
has 
been 

relatively mixed, Hang appears to 
be an album in which the duo 
have tried to create a more 
unique sound, which seems to 
be a mix between Broadway 
and psychedelic rock, leaving 
nearly all indie-rock influences 
behind. The addition of a 
40-piece orchestra, along with 
several guest appearances by 
instrumentalists, means there 
is a wider sound than on any 
previous release from the band.

This isn’t to say Hang is 

without any form of artistic 
borrowing. The album jumps 
between 
each 
influence 

without missing a step, and the 
confidence of the songwriting 
is assured, as if Foxygen know 
they’re writing to impress. 
There’s rare confidence present 
for an artist entering such new 
territory. But this also leads to lack 
of nuance on the album, with some 

songs seeming to 
trail off at the end 
through a lack of 
focus.

“On 

Lankershim” opens 
like an Elton John 

classic, before segwaying into 
something altogether more weird 
and wonderful. Choral vocals 
throughout and layered strings 
in the background create an epic 
sound, surprising at every musical 
shift. On the other hand, “Follow 
the Leader” starts sultry, with a 

funky beat that speaks straight to 
your soul. Crooning female vocals 
echo the lead singer as he skips 
through his lines with a “I know a 
secret you don’t” tone. Although 

the lyrics aren’t altogether that 
inspiring, the music still manages 
to be.

Aside from the classic rock 

borrowing, 
there 
seems 
to 

be a flip side where Rado 
and France seem to borrow 
excessively 
from 
pop 
and 

Broadway influences. There is 
no denying the decidedly ABBA-
esque chorus of “Avalon” that then 
prances off into a joyful piano 
interlude.

These influences fall flat 

on several songs. “America” 
is a five minute track that flips 
between genres, and it just doesn’t 
work. The song doesn’t make 
sense — lyrically it’s trying to 
be 
some 
forward 
thinking 

revolutionary, but musically 
it’s stuck between swing and 
some mix of musical style 
pomp. This kind of confused 
style is ultimately what lets the 
album down. Instead of being 
interesting and new, it just ends 
up messy, and the songs quickly 
become forgettable due to such 
convolution.

Listening 
to 
Hang 
is 

still an experience of the 
extraordinary, with interesting 
divulges into the odd on nearly 
every song. But the sheer 
amount of influences makes 
the album a weird retro mash 
up of the new and old that only 
works brilliantly on a few odd 
occasions. The rest of the album 
just 
feels 
rehashed. 
Although 

worth a listen, Hang relies 
too heavily on its influences, 
and fails to capture something 
greater.

McAvoy anchors intense ‘Split’

After 
fifteen 
years, 
M. 

Night Shyamalan (“The Sixth 
Sense”) has returned to top 
form. His newest 
film, “Split,” is 
an 
exercise 
in 

the 
construction 

of 
atmosphere 

with which the 
director, who has 
spent 
much 
of 

the last decade-
and-a-half 
in 

the 
cinematic 

doghouse, 
once 

made his name. It 
is both a reminder 
of what Shyamalan can do at 
the height of his abilities and a 
promise of a bold new chapter 
in his career where he has 
overcome his own ego to return 
to interesting storytelling.

James 
McAvoy 
(“X-Men: 

Apocalypse”) leads the small 
cast, 
which 
includes 
Anya 

Taylor-Joy (“The Witch”) and 
Haley Lu Richardson (“The 
Edge of Seventeen”), and to 
call 
McAvoy’s 
performance 

commanding 
is 
a 
massive 

understatement. As Kevin, a 
man with Dissociative Identity 
Disorder, McAvoy gives an 
incredibly varied performance. 
There 
is 
an 
ensemble 
of 

separately 
interesting 

characters inside one body, 
and McAvoy makes them all 
memorable. It’s also worth 
noting that, for those worried 
about how “Split” may affect 
public 
perception 
of 
those 

living with D.I.D., Shyamalan 
makes it clear by the film’s 

end that Kevin has something 
wholly different. Discerning 
viewers should have no problem 
separating the fiction onscreen 
from the reality of the disorder.

As 
director, 
Shyamalan 

shows an impressive command 
of the camera, choosing to let 

his shots linger, 
sometimes longer 
than 
may 
feel 

necessary, 
in 

order to build the 
claustrophobic 
atmosphere 
of 

Kevin’s 
lair. 

Even during the 
later 
scenes 
of 

the movie when 
it ventures from 
thriller to full-
on 
horror, 
he 

chooses to let the camera roll 
rather than succumbing to the 
rapid cutting the dominates 
much of the horror landscape, 
resulting in a much more 
terrifying 
and 
rewarding 

climax. 
In 
particular, 
his 

Hitchcockian use of shots, 
which put the viewer in the 
point-of-view of his characters, 
provides numerous scares on 
its own.

The most interesting scenes 

“Split” has to offer, however, are 
the meetings between Kevin 
and his psychiatrist (Betty 
Buckley, “The Happening”). 
Not 
only 
do 
these 
scenes 

provide a look into Kevin’s 
psyche and streamline some 
necessary exposition, they also 
build something approaching 
a mythology. Shyamalan gives 
his audience glimpses into his 
lead’s past and present, which 
sets the stage for the reveals 
towards the end of the movie.

If “Split” has one flaw, it’s 

that some of the characters, 
particularly the young women 
Kevin kidnaps, don’t get the 
development that would allow 
us to further empathize with 
them. Taylor-Joy’s Casey does 
all right for herself, though one 
of her big character moments 
feels a tad forced. Though 

the focus of the film is not on 
the characters portrayed by 
Jessica Sula (“Skins”) and the 
aforementioned 
Richardson, 

the proceedings would have 
gained further added weight 
had the two felt more fully 
formed.

Shyamalan takes the unique 

premise of “Split” to its full 
potential, using the thriller 
tale to tell a compelling story 
of abuse and its affects. It’s 
proficiency in storytelling that 
has been sorely lacking from 
his recent efforts and recalls 
his 2000 superhero thriller 
“Unbreakable” in many ways. 
As the credits roll and the 
obligatory last twist unravels 
spectacularly, 
there 
is 
a 

distinct feeling that his career 
has at last been reinvigorated.

EnspiRED’s latest fashion show.

I couldn’t think of a better 

ending to a day of worldwide 
activism.

This 
past 
Saturday 

night, student organization 
EnspiRED 
presented 
their 

annual runway show in the 
main lobby at the Alfred 
A. 
Taubman 
Biomedical 

Research Building.

The night began with a 

VIP 
pre-show 
featuring 
a 

complimentary 
buffet, 
gift 

bags and a live performance by 
singer-songwriter Rella. The 
pre-show chatter consisted of 
attendees complimenting one 

another’s outfits and taking 
pictures for the ‘gram.

Around 6:45 — the show 

was slated to begin at 7 
— the speakers cut from 
Rella’s velvety vocals to the 
thumping, uncensored beats 
of hip hop’s current hits (think 
“Bad and Boujee,” “Caroline”). 
General admission audience 
members began filing in from 
all entrances. Though most 
appeared to be close friends 
and family of the EnspiRED 
team, 
the 
excitement 

throughout the event space 
was palpable.

The 
show 
began 
at 

approximately 
7:30. 
Titled 

“Urban 
Behavior,” 
it 

featured 
eight 
separate 

“scenes,” which functioned 
as mini fashion shows with 
their own individual sub-
themes, ranging from “City 
Necessities” to “For Us, By 
Us.” The production kicked off 
with a dimming of the lights, 
and soon the audience was 
immersed in a dreamy string 
of 
Detroit-centered 
visuals 

created by University student 
Corey Johnson. Soon, models 
of every race and size were 
parading up and down the 
runway, eliciting boisterous 
cheers 
from 
the 
ever-

involved crowd (think: “YES 
CANDACE! GET IT GIRL!” as 
the model in question strode 
about 
in 
her 
streetwear-

inspired garb).

The clothing was provided 

by a wide range of designers, 
from 
the 
Detroit 
based-

youngsters at 51/50 to monster 
brands like Windsor. Styling 
the 
outfits 
entailed 
some 

occasional 
gender-bending: 

Girls strode as confidently 
in basketball shorts as their 
male counterparts did in pink 
pantsuits.

Although 
every 
look 

was beautiful, what struck 
me most was the kinship 
between model and audience 
member. The entire night 
felt 
remarkably 
familial, 

especially given the fashion 
world’s frequent association 
with coldness. Urban Behavior 
was less about the clothes, and 
more about the sense of unity 
that the event fostered.

Midway through the show, 

EnspiRED’s 
Community 

Service Chairs took to the 
runway to let everyone know 
what the purpose of the event 
really was. Everyone in the 

organization is involved in 
some form of service, the 
girls 
explained, 
and 
this 

year 
EnspiRED 
had 
come 

together to raise funds for 

Northwestern 
High 
School 

in Flint. They would even be 
holding an activity day at the 
school in February with the 
intent of preparing students 
for their futures.

The 
show 
closed 
with 

homage to peaceful protest 
in Scene 8, “By Us, For Us.” 
Models paraded across the 
stage 
holding 
signs 
that 

boasted 
positive 
messages, 

such as “Save Our Earth,” “Yes 
Means Yes” and the timely 
“Feminism is Equality.” Each 
provoked a new spurt of cheers 
from even the very back row. I 
felt like I was re-experiencing 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
Women’s 

March, which I had attended 
that afternoon, in an even 
more diverse, optimistic way.

EnspiRED’s Urban Behavior 

was inclusive in the truest 
sense. For the first time since 
my arrival at U of M, I finally 
felt like I was experiencing 
genuine 
diversification. 

The 
organization 
presents 

our campus with a pocket 
of beauty seldom found in 
a whitewashed, pessimistic 
world.

Quartet for the end of time

My parents are musicians. Not 

the cool, rock-band type, with 
national tours and color-flooded 
light shows and electric guitars. I 
know because when I was a kid and 
first learned they were musicians, 
this was the picture that I had in 
mind, and it was — sadly, I thought 
— incongruous with what I saw 
in day-to-day life. Instead of 
shaking hands with famous VIPs 
backstage at rock concerts, I spent 
many a night of my childhood 
sitting bored in the middle 
of a concert hall, doodling on 
programs while my parents took 
formal bows atop a minimalistic 
stage. When I was interested in 
music, I was interested in the songs 
on the radio and old Beatles CDs, 
the things I could dance to. Scarcely 
did it occur to me that this chamber 
music could ever truly impact the 
lives of random listeners, or affect 
people in the same way that I was 
affected by music that made more 
sense to me. That these pieces, 
from the inventive movements 
of 
contemporary 
compositions 

to the symphonies of long-dead 
composers, could move people 
profoundly, and tell stories that 
mattered.

When I was ten years old, I 

traveled to Alabama to watch my 
mother and three of her colleagues 
perform 
Olivier 
Messiaen’s 

“Quartet for the End of Time.” We 
arrived at the concert hall early 
and, having brought nothing else 
with me to do while the quartet 
rehearsed, I spent what felt like 
hours reading, re-reading, doodling 
all over and re-re-reading the 
program, which explained the 
context in which the piece was 
written. It was the story of the 
“Quartet for the End of Time” (or, 
untranslated, “Quatuor pour la fin 
du temps”) that has prompted 
me ever since then to allow 
music to touch me. That story 
made me recognize that music 
is a human experience: It is created 
by people who are trying to reach 
out to the world using the best of 
themselves, and, as the listener, I 
have the option of reaching back.

Messiaen was a young composer 

living in France during World War 
II, and in 1940 he was imprisoned 
by the German army in a camp 
called Stalag VIII-A. It was in 
this prisoner-of-war camp that 
Messiaen made the acquaintance 
of clarinetist Henri Akoka, violinist 
Jean de Boulaire and cellist 
Étienne Pasquier, all of whom 
were fellow prisoners. It was 
also here that he composed the 
quartet, adding himself as the 
pianist. The piece is named, of 
course, for the end of the world, 
and each movement represents 
a 
different 
stage 
in 
the 

religious cleaving of humanity, 
the addled process of love, 
destruction and apocalyptic 
absolution. The camp guards 
allowed 
the 
musicians 
to 

perform 
this 
quartet 
for 

themselves and for the other 
prisoners 
using 
dilapidated 

instruments, and the piece’s 
premiere took place in January 
of 1941 at Stalag VIII-A, outside 
and in the rain.

The idea that people could 

relate to music in this way 
astounded me. It resonated 
with me that a man could 
— and did — write an entire 
quartet, eight movements of 
translated emotion, imprisoned 
in a foreign country during 
one of the bloodiest wars of 
history. I tried to imagine 
the musicians playing on the 
battered 
instruments, 
the 

guards 
who 
allowed 
them 

to play and the prisoners of 
war who gathered and saw 
the piece first performed in 
the middle of the camp. The 
thought of all of these people 
watching this musical premiere 
in the middle of a war made 
me think that this event must 
have 
deeply 
impacted 
and 

revealed 
something 
about 

everyone who was involved in 
its manifestation.

In the years since then, I have 

been struck many times over by 
people’s commitment to music 
and deep faith in it as a measure 
of humanity. This is true both 
of dedicated musicians, like my 
parents, and of people whose 
lives and careers have nothing 
to do with music at all. We all 
have songs that we go back to 
when life feels so oppressive 
that the word “hard” doesn’t 
even begin to cover it — songs 
that tune us into our own pain, 
songs that cleanse us. Only 
yesterday, in one of my English 
classes, I learned about how 
Rosa Parks, upon hearing of Dr. 
King’s assassination, reacted 
by holding her mother, crying 
and listening to Sam Cooke’s 
“A Change is Gonna Come” 
over and over again. According 
to biographer Doug Brinkley, 
Parks said that Cooke’s voice 
“soothed” her and that his 
words were “like medicine to 
the soul.”

This 
past 
weekend, 
my 

mother performed the quartet 
yet again, this time at Michigan 
State 
University. 
Over 
the 

phone, she told me about how 
people were crying — both 
the performers and members 
of the audience — as they 
reached the final movement, 
which is meant to represent the 
achievement of love and faith 
at the culmination of the end 
of time. When I think about 
it, this is truly one of the most 
important things that music 
does for people. It reveals our 
commitment to creativity and 
personhood, brings us together 
when there is nothing else to, 
and offers us love, strength and 
community, even in the face of 
the end of the world.

Wolverines growing on the defensive end

On Jan. 11 in Champaign, 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team allowed Illinois to shoot 64 
percent from both the field and 
beyond the arc in a game which 
the Fighting Illini scored 1.393 
points per possession.

It was a contest that Michigan 

coach 
John 
Beilein 
labeled 

as the potential “low point” 
of the season, and there were 
seemingly very few solutions 
to the Wolverines’ defensive 
problem.

Twelve 
days 
later, 
spirits 

around the team are much 
higher.

Saturday, 
Michigan 
had 
a 

chance at revenge against the 
same Illinois team. This time, 
the game was back in Ann Arbor, 
and the Wolverines took their 
opportunity and ran with it.

Michigan held Illinois to just 

0.891 
points 
per 
possession, 

forcing 17 turnovers en route to a 
66-57 victory.

“That’s why our (defensive 

efficiency rating) was so good,” 
Beilein said. “They still shot 45 
percent, but they turned it over 
some, they threw it away.

“I just thought we were there. 

We were active. We were in gaps. 
We were swarming to the ball. We 
were flying around.” 

Fighting 
Illini 
forward 

Maverick Morgan, who scored 16 
points on 8-for-9 shooting in the 
game in Champaign, was held to 
just six points Saturday.

Overall, Illinois shot 46 percent 

from the field and just 17 percent 
from behind the arc, a stark 
difference from the two teams’ 
first matchup.

All in all, Michigan’s defense 

seemed 
to 
be 
a 
completely 

different unit than the one that 
took the court in Champaign ten 
days prior.

“We just want people to be 

what we call ‘quick men’, ” Beilein 
said. “Get to the ball, be there 
quick, if you have to give help, 
give help. But definitely be more 
physical on post ups, and make 
their catches higher and more 
difficult.”

In 
the 
last 
meeting, 
the 

Wolverines allowed the Fighting 
Illini too much space to shoot, 
paving the way for Illinois’ 
85-point outburst.

Saturday, 
Michigan 
closed 

down that space, allowing the 
Fighting Illini little room to 
operate.

“We wanted to take (shots) 

away from them because they 
were 
exceptional 
last 
time,” 

Beilein said. “I haven’t seen Black 
shoot like he did against us, and 
the same with their big guy, 
Morgan. He really shot the heck 
out of it. We ran at people and 

tried to get them to make quick 
decisions, and some of that led to 
turnovers.”

Added senior wing Zak Irvin: 

“The big thing is knowing the 
scouting report, and knowing and 
executing our game plan the way 
we want to. It’s big for us to be able 
to win this afternoon, and as long 
as we do that, we put ourselves in 
a position to win games.”

But 
this 
type 
of 
defense 

requires stamina, especially for 
the players who need to be able 
to track and close out shooters on 
a consistent basis. And with the 
starting five soaking up most of 
the minutes, fatigue becomes an 
issue.

So the Wolverines have had to 

adapt a new mindset.

“The biggest (challenge) has 

been fighting fatigue,” Irvin said 
after Saturday’s win. “Being out 
there and playing a lot of minutes, 

you can’t really take any plays off, 
especially on the defensive end 
because you never know what 
possession will change the whole 
game. Everyone on the team had 
that mentality, and it worked out 
well for us.”

With 
this 
renewed 
sense 

of confidence in its defense, 
Michigan heads into a crucial 
portion of its schedule. The 
Wolverines will play four of their 
next six games at home, and that 
stretch of six games will include 
matchups against both Indiana 
and Michigan State twice, as 
well as Ohio State and No. 15 
Wisconsin.

It’s a precarious position for 

Michigan to be in, but after a 
narrow loss to the Badgers last 
Tuesday and a win over Illinois on 
Saturday, the Wolverines are in a 
much better place than they were 
12 days ago in Champaign. 

After hitting its low point in Champaign on Jan. 11, Michigan showed signs of 
improvement, holding the Fighting Illini to 46 percent shooting in the rematch

Senior wing Zak Irvin has stressed that Michigan can’t fall prey to fatigue if its defense is to remain at a high level.

Michigan’s preseason 
goals within its reach

Entering the 2016-17 season, 

the Michigan women’s basketball 
team had two goals. The first 
was to finish in the top four of 
the Big Ten standings for the 
first time in Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico’s tenure. The second 
was to earn its second NCAA 
Tournament berth in five years.

The Wolverines (5-2 Big Ten, 

16-5 overall) are right where they 
wanted to be in the Big Ten — 
sitting at third in the conference 
standings behind No. 15 Ohio 
State and No. 3 Maryland. The 
Wolverines are half a game ahead 
of Northwestern and one game in 
front of both Iowa and Purdue.

Michigan — currently No. 35 

in the Ratings Percentage Index 
— is also sitting pretty in its quest 
to crack the 64-team NCAA 
Tournament field. 

ESPN.com’s 
Bracketology, 

which was updated Jan. 16, has 
the Wolverines as a nine seed 
playing California. The website 
College Sports Madness is even 
more optimistic about Michigan’s 
chances, giving it a No. 6 seed 
facing off against Oregon. Its 
chances are buoyed by the fact 
that it boasts four wins against 
teams ranked in the RPI top 
100, a measure used to select 
tournament squads.

“I think this is our deepest 

team,” Barnes Arico said. “My 
first year, I was fortunate to 
inherit a group of seniors that had 
played together for four years, 
that were experienced and were 
hard workers. But they couldn’t 
score the basketball like this team 
can.”

The Wolverines’ success is in 

large part due to the emergence 
of 
sophomore 
center 
Hallie 

Thome 
and 
freshman 
guard 

Kysre Gondrezick, who have 
begun to complement junior 
guard 
Katelynn 
Flaherty’s 

scoring ability. The trio have led 
Michigan’s scoring offense, which 
is fourth in the Big Ten averaging 
79.7 points per game.

Flaherty was recently dubbed 

an honorable mention on the Big 
Ten Player of the Week list thanks 
to her 30 points in the Wolverines’ 
93-80 loss to the Terrapins last 
Thursday and her 27 points in an 
84-51 victory over Nebraska on 
Sunday. It was her fourth such 
honor this season.

Thome, 
meanwhile, 
has 

notched 
four 
double-doubles 

this year, while Gondrezick has 
scored at least 10 points in 14 of 
Michigan’s 21 contests.

“I think we’ve tried to, and 

we’ve improved on, sharing the 
basketball,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Making extra passes, taking 
high-percentage shots instead of 
the first shot. We want to get the 
best shot.”

The offensive firepower has not 

come at the expense of the defense, 
as the Wolverines are allowing 
just 58.5 points per game, good for 
second in the conference. Against 
the Cornhuskers, Michigan did 
not allow a field goal in the final 
9:48 of the contest.

To be sure, the Wolverines’ 

season has not been one of 
perfection. They have lost all four 
games they have played against 
opponents currently in the AP 
top 25, none by fewer than nine 
points. Michigan will not face 
another ranked opponent unless 
it meets Maryland or Ohio State in 
the Big Ten Tournament, but that 
doesn’t mean the Wolverines have 
no opportunities to further their 
NCAA Tournament resume. 

Michigan will face five more 

teams who currently sit in the 
RPI top 100, though none are 
above the Wolverines. Michigan’s 
best opportunity for another 
quality win comes in its next 
contest, Wednesday night against 
Northwestern, which is ranked 
No. 45 in the RPI.

Lockwood reacclimating after injury

After 
dislocating 
his 

shoulder 
in 
the 
Michigan 

hockey team’s Dec. 10 game 
against Wisconsin, freshman 
forward Will Lockwood made 
his return to the ice at the Great 
Lakes Invitational almost three 
weeks later.

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

struggled in the first game of 
the GLI against Michigan Tech, 
the offense exploded for four 
goals against Michigan State 
in the third-place game, with 
Lockwood tallying one himself.

But late in the second period, 

things 
went 
wrong. 
While 

killing a penalty, Lockwood 
reaggravated 
his 
shoulder 

injury and needed to get off the 
ice. At the time, the Spartans 
were 
camped 
out 
in 
the 

Wolverines’ zone, threatening 
to score. While holding his 
injured arm with one hand, 
Lockwood remained on the ice 
and even blocked a shot from 
the point before mercifully 

making his way to the bench.

It’s the kind of play that earns 

respect from teammates and 
coaches alike, but for Lockwood, 
it was just something he knew 
he had to do.

“The easiest thing to do is 

just ignore the pain,” Lockwood 
said. “Getting off the ice at that 
point gives them a 5-on-3, which 
is a pretty high percentage 
chance 
that 

they’ll score. So 
if you have to 
stay out there 
for 
a 
couple 

extra 
seconds 

of pain, I think 
it’s 
worth 
it 

from 
a 
team 

aspect.”

Michigan 

coach 
Red 

Berenson 
took notice, too. And to him, 
it reaffirmed his feelings on 
Lockwood’s commitment and 
toughness.

“Will has got a lot of will,” 

Berenson said. “He’s got a lot 
of drive and mental toughness 

and so on. He brings it. I would 
have told him to get off the ice 
at that point, but he couldn’t. 
It was a tough change, and he 
stayed out there and showed his 
teammates what he’s made of. 
It’s a bit of a character test.”

After reaggravating the injury, 

Lockwood was out of action 
for an even longer absence. 
He 
missed 
the 
Wolverines’ 

series 
against 

Minnesota 
two 

weekends 
ago 

before returning 
to play against 
the Spartans last 
weekend.

But 
even 

though he was 
back in the lineup 
last 
weekend, 

Lockwood 
had 

been wearing a 

red jersey in practice the week 
prior, signifying that he was 
not a full-contact participant. 
Facing off against Michigan 
State, Lockwood was forced to 
reacclimate to game speed.

“At first I was a little hesitant, 

because I wasn’t completely 
confident 
with 
how 
strong 

my shoulder was,” Lockwood 
said. “But after getting hit a 
couple of times and delivering 
some hits, it was just kind of 
back to my old game, where I 
play that physical game. I had 
100-percent confidence going 
into the corners and taking a 
guy out of the play.”

Michigan is eager to have 

Lockwood 
back 
in 
a 
full 

capacity. He is the team’s 
second-leading 
scorer 
with 

13 points, and his offensive 
capabilities could have helped 
the Wolverines against the 
Golden Gophers.

While Lockwood may have 

wanted to return earlier than he 
did to help his team, Berenson 
knew that Michigan needed 
him to be at full health when he 
came back.

“Most of us would want to 

play anyway,” Berenson said. 
“The number one thing for me 
as a coach is the kid’s safety. 
Like I’ve told kids in the past, 
‘You can play with that. It’s 
not going to get any worse,’ 
whatever the injury is. Or, if 
it’s an injury, like a knee, that 
it could get worse, ‘Forget it, 
you’re not playing. You’ve got 
to get it better.’ We’ve had 
enough experience with hockey 
injuries — between the trainer, 
myself and the doctors — that 
we’re going to do what’s best for 
the kids.”

For Lockwood, the time off 

was enough to motivate him to 
rehabilitate his injury properly 
so that he won’t have to sit out 
again any time soon.

“A lot of hockey players would 

agree that watching your team 
play from the stands is one of 
the hardest things,” Lockwood 
said. “You always want to be 
out on the ice and helping your 
team. It’s hard to be out in the 
stands and thinking you could 
be making an impact on the 
game.

“It’s a tough thing to battle 

injuries. But I’ve been doing 
a lot of rehab right now and 
strengthening 
my 
shoulder. 

So hopefully it won’t happen 
again.”

Artz highlights strong
outing for Wolverines

Though Crisler Center was 

just a quarter full Sunday, 
the crowd’s presence seemed 
much greater, especially when 
senior 
Nicole 
Artz 
earned 

a perfect score on her floor 
routine. With the fans cheering 
loudly for each of the Michigan 
women’s 
gymnastics 
team’s 

frequent sticks, the Wolverines 
tallied a score above 197.000 
for the first time in 2017. The 
12th-ranked Wolverines (1-1 
Big Ten, 3-2 overall) defeated 
No. 19 Illinois (0-1 Big Ten, 1-2 
overall), 197.050 - 195.300.

Artz’s 
perfect 
score 
in 

Sunday’s home opener was the 
first time in three years that 
a Michigan gymnast scored 
a 10.0 during a meet. Joanna 
Sampson last accomplished the 
same feat on the floor at the Big 
Ten Championships in 2014. 
Artz has been 
approaching 
perfection 
for 

some 
time, 

scoring a 9.975 
four 
times, 

most 
recently 

on floor at the 
2016 
Big 
Ten 

Championships 
on floor. 

“I 
do 
that 

(floor) 
routine 

about 
three 

or four times a week and one 
really good one in here every 
weekend,” Artz said.

Immediately 
following 

her floor routine, the crowd 
erupted and Artz was swarmed 
by her teammates. Finally, the 
score was announced and Artz 
had done it — a perfect score. 
In her first meet of the year 
competing in the all-around, 
Artz ended the day with a 
total of 39.425 points, earning 
her the all-around title for the 
meet.

“I didn’t know it, but I 

finished and I looked at the 
judge and was like ‘Please!’,” 
Artz said. “I was just so excited 

to get over to my teammates.”

In addition to Artz’s perfect 

10, several Wolverines had 
career records, and Michigan 
swept the event titles.

On the vault, senior Talia 

Chiarelli captured the event 
with a 9.900. The Wolverines 
finished the vault event with 
49.000 points.

On the uneven bars, three 

Wolverines received a score of 
9.900 or higher. For the first 
time in their careers, both 
freshman Polina Shchennikova 
and junior Lauren Marinez 
earned a 9.900 in the event. 
Junior Paige Zaziski ended 
her routine on the uneven bars 
with enthusiastic yelling as she 
landed her dismount to earn a 
score of 9.975 — a career best.

Following 
her 
career-

best on the uneven parallel 
bars, 
Marinez 
fed 
off 
of 

her momentum and scored 
a season-best 9.875 on the 

balance 
beam. 

This 
score 

earned her the 
event title.

The 
top 

five 
scores 

in 
the 
floor 

routine 
event 

were 
recorded 

entirely 
by 

Michigan 
athletes. 
Leading 
the 

scoring 
was 

Artz with her perfect 10, 
followed by sophomores Emma 
McLean and Olivia Karas with 
a score of 9.900. McLean’s 
score of 9.900 was a career 
best. Freshman Maddy Osman 
and 
Chiarelli 
tied 
Illinois 

sophomore Lizzy Leduc with a 
score of 9.825.

“It’s just nice to be at home,” 

Artz said. “It’s nice to be back 
in Crisler and have such good 
momentum going into floor.” 

By the end of the meet, 

Michigan couldn’t have had 
much better of a day. And after 
four years, Artz finally put an 
exclamation point on the day 
with her perfect 10.

Wolverines carry momentum 
into Notre Dame Invitational

Coming off a second-place finish 

at the NCAA Championships for 
cross country last November, Erin 
Finn hasn’t lost her step.

The senior ran away from the 

rest of the field in the 3,000-meter 
race at Saturday’s Notre Dame 
Invitational in South Bend, Ind., 
winning with a time of 9:07.24 – 
the fastest time in the nation so far 
this season.

Finn’s victory helped lead the 

No. 12 Michigan women’s track 
and field team to a first-place 
finish in its first scored meet of 
the regular season. With a score 
of 113 points, the Wolverines 
bested a field consisting of 
DePaul, 
Louisville, 
Michigan 

State, North Carolina, Notre 
Dame and Virginia, finishing 24 
points clear of the second-place 
Cardinals.

Finn was not alone in her 

efforts as Michigan asserted its 
dominance in the distance events. 
Five of the next six finishers in 
her race were also Wolverines, 
including redshirt junior Gina 
Sereno, fifth-year senior Kira 
Garry and redshirt junior Avery 
Evenson, who finished second, 
fourth and fifth respectively. 
Along with Finn, Sereno and 
Evenson comprised the top three 
runners for a Michigan cross 
country team that finished second 
at the NCAA Championships last 
fall.

Senior 
Jamie 
Morrissey, 

another returner from the cross 
country team, added to the 
Wolverines’ point total with a win 
in the 800-meter race, setting a 
personal record of 2:06.44 — a 
top-10 time in the nation — while 
junior Claire Borchers took third 
in that race.

“We’re kind of riding that wave 

of determination and effort that 
we were during cross country,” 
Finn said. “We’ve got work to do 
and we’re doing it, and we’re going 

out and earning it every time we’re 
out there.” 

Michigan also had success 

in 
shorter-distance 
races, 
as 

freshman Jade Harrison won 
the 400-meter race with a time 
of 55.46. Harrison improved on 
her time from last week by nearly 
half a second while remaining 
unbeaten so far in her short 
collegiate career. And in the final 
event of the day — the 4x400-
meter relay — the Wolverines’ 
team 
of 
Morrissey, 
Borchers 

and juniors Sydney Badger and 
Meghan Marias recorded a time 
of 3:44.39.

Other key performances for the 

Wolverines included freshman 
Torisa 
Johnson, 
who 
placed 

third in the 60-meter dash in 
7.59, and freshman Julia Hall, 
who improved upon her college 
debut by two seconds, finishing in 
1:33.23 to finish second in the 600-
meter race. Junior Jaimie Phelan 
took second in the mile race with 
a time of 4:48.17, with sophomore 
Holly Petrusson close behind her 
in third.

Sophomore 
Emma 
Bauer 

cleared a career-high height of 
3.85 meters to place second in 

the pole vault, while sophomore 
Jeryne Fish and junior Aaron 
Howell were third and fourth, 
respectively, in the long jump. 
In the weight throw, freshman 
Courtney Jacobsen and junior 
Bailey Baker placed fifth and 
sixth, both recording personal 
bests in the process. 

With only two meets under the 

Wolverines’ belt, Michigan coach 
James Henry recognizes the need 
to continue gaining experience, 
though the positive atmosphere 
surrounding his team is a good 
sign for their development.

“We’ve got good chemistry 

going on,” Henry said. “We’ve 
got a mixture of veterans and 
young kids, and (the veterans) are 
working very hard to keep the 
young kids relaxed.”

Finn iterated a similar tone as 

her coach. She believes that the 
early results have been promising, 
but the Wolverines’ best is yet to 
come.

“The (main objective) of today 

for me and all my teammates was 
to go out and get a good effort in,” 
Finn said. “We ended up running a 
little bit slower than we wanted to, 
but the effort was there.”

Michigan rolls Crimson Tide

In the Michigan men’s tennis 

team’s first dual match last 
year, the Wolverines suffered 
a heartbreaking 4-3 loss to 
Kentucky, leaving the team in a 
rut at the onset of its season.

“After we lost that first match 

last year, it took us a while to 
get the confidence going,” said 
Michigan coach Adam Steinberg. 
“When you get the first one under 
your belt, the guys feel good.”

This year, the Wolverines had 

different plans. No. 21 Michigan 
(1-0) shutout Alabama, 4-0, in its 
regular season opener Saturday 
evening. The match gave the 

Wolverines a change of scenery, 
as their showdown with the 
Crimson Tide (2-1) took place 
outdoors at the United States 
Tennis 
Association 
National 

Campus in Orlando, Fla.

The victory puts Michigan 

one step closer to eligibility 
in the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association 
National 
Team 

Indoor Championships. With one 
win to their name, the Wolverines 
need just two more match wins 
next weekend at the ITA kickoff 
against Oklahoma to earn a spot 
in the championships.

On Saturday, junior Davis 

Crocker secured the win for 
Michigan at the No. 6 singles 
position, defeating his Alabama 

opponent in dominant fashion, 
6-2, 6-4. Crocker finalized the 
win in style, slamming a series 
of 
crosscourt 
forehands 
and 

backhands, and sealed the deal 
with a deep backhand volley past 
his opponent.

The Wolverines claimed the 

doubles point with the wins 
of their No. 2 and 3 doubles 
duos. 
At 
the 
second 
spot, 

juniors Runhao Hua and Alex 
Knight won quickly, 6-1, while 
at the third spot, sophomore 
Myles Schalet and senior Tyler 
Gardiner eked out a 6-4 victory. 
Schalet and Gardiner were neck 
and neck with their opponents, 
but broke serve to take a 5-4 lead 
before holding Schalet’s serve to 
win.

Michigan then steamrolled the 

Crimson Tide in singles, acquiring 
all three of its singles wins in 
straight sets. Schalet, Knight 
and Crocker outperformed their 
opponents at the No. 3, 5 and 6 
singles slots, respectively.

While Crocker’s win sealed 

his team’s victory, there was 
still room for improvement to 
be found across three other 
matches. The No. 1 doubles team 
of seniors Jathan Malik and 
Kevin Wong were tied at 5-5 
with their Alabama opponents 
when their Michigan teammates 
clinched 
the 
doubles 
point, 

ending the doubles portion of 
the match. 

Malik and Wong would face 

the same fate in their singles 
competition. Malik was down, 
3-6, 5-5, at the No. 1 slot, and 
Wong held a slight advantage of 
7-6, 1-1 over his opponent at the 
No. 2 position when both matches 
were called off.

Steinberg 
viewed 
these 

matches as too close, and sought 
more endurance on the courts 
throughout the competition. 

“I would like us to be a little 

more aggressive and better as a 
team,” Steinberg said. “I feel like 
our energy dipped a bit [in the 
match].”

Though Steinberg hopes to 

see more from his team, the 
Wolverines’ Saturday sweep is 
a promising sign for what is to 
come in their upcoming season. 

MEN’S TENNIS

Ellis leads ‘M’ to dominant win

Joe Ellis had already broken 

his own program record in the 
weight throw on his second 
attempt at the Notre Dame 
Invitational. For good measure, 
on his sixth and final attempt, 
he surpassed it again.

The 
sophomore’s 
winning 

throw of 22.02 meters helped lead 
the Michigan men’s track and 
field team to a dominating victory 
at the same competition where 
the Wolverines claimed their first 
victory in a scored meet under 
coach Jerry Clayton last season.

The 
Wolverines 
finished 

well ahead of the seven-team 
field 
consisting 
of 
DePaul, 

Louisville, 
Michigan 
State, 

North Carolina, Notre Dame 
and Virginia, racking up 133 
points and finishing 47 points 
ahead 
of 
the 
second-place 

Cardinals.

Six Michigan athletes took 

home individual victories in 
their events, but Ellis’ record-
setting performance — the 
second-best mark in the nation 
— was the highlight of the day.

“(The record is) a validation 

of the hard work that me, coach 
Clayton and the rest of the guys 
have put in,” Ellis said.

Junior 
Drake 
Johnson 

has established himself as a 
consistent force in the 60-meter 
hurdles. Johnson, who doubles 
as a running back, finished in 
7.95 seconds to win the race, 
and has now set career-bests in 
both of his meets this season.

Also in the sprint category, 

junior 
Khoury 
Crenshaw 

claimed victory in the 60-meter 
dash with a time of 6.75, tying 
his personal best. Participating 
in his first 400-meter race of 
the season, sophomore Taylor 
McLaughlin won with a time 
of 47.02, while freshman Alex 
Schwedt finished close behind 
him in third place.

The 800-meter race yielded 

more positive results for the 
Wolverines. Junior Brennan 
Munley 
entered 
the 
race 

holding the third-fastest time 
in the nation at that distance, 
but was overcome at the finish 
by senior Ned Willig. Willig 
finished with a time of 1:50.13, 
just 0.24 seconds ahead of 
Munley.

“The times were good, but 

the way (Willig and Munley) 
competed to place and score for 
the team was outstanding as 
well,” Clayton said.

Michigan runners made up 

five of the top eight finishers in 
the mile race, with sophomore 
Chase Barnett leading the pack 
by running a time of 4:07.33 to 
finish in second place. Junior 
Austin 
Benoit 
and 
senior 

Ben Flanagan were the other 
Wolverine scorers, crossing the 
finish line within a second of 
Barnett. Junior Micah Beller 
bolstered 
the 
Wolverines’ 

distance corps with a time of 
8:17.98, good for second place in 
the 3000-meter race.

The Wolverines also saw a 

standout 
performance 
from 

senior Steven Bastien to win 
the long jump. Bastien, who 
also competes in the heptathlon 
and 60-meter hurdles, leapt 
7.57 meters, a personal record 
for him. Junior Kevin Stephens 
Jr.’s triple jump of 14.93 meters 
placed him second in that event.

But above all the individual 

triumphs, 
the 
first 
scored 

meet of the season provided 
Michigan an opportunity to 
show the progress it has made 
in uniting as a team throughout 
Clayton’s tenure. While the 
Wolverines featured winners 
in a wide array of events, the 
newfound team chemistry has 
been equally as important to 
Clayton as the improvement on 
the track.

“This team is starting to 

really jell and this has been 
occurring for about a year and 
a half now,” Clayton said. “(The 
athletes) really make an effort 
to learn the other events so they 
know and are really starting to 
cheer and support each other.

“When I came here that 

wasn’t always the case, but now 
distance runners and sprinters 
and field events, they’re all one 
team instead of segments, and 
are really supportive of each 
other.”
