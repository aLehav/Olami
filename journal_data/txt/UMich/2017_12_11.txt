ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Emma Kinery, editor in 

chief, The Michigan Daily

Journalism 
is 
changing 

tremendously — which, in some 
ways, makes being the editor of a 
college paper more difficult than 
it has ever been — but it’s also 
pretty exciting. The Michigan 
Daily operates editorially and 
financially independent of the 
University of Michigan; coming 
into the role of editor in chief, I 
didn’t realize there would be such 
an emphasis on the business side of 
things and on monetizing content, 
but that’s a necessary shift. When 

I first began at The Daily, we were 
discussing whether to prioritize 
print or digital, and we had just 
launched our new website. Now, 
there isn’t a discussion about 
whether to put digital first — 
it’s a given. It’s about creating 
compelling content, as well as 
thinking about how students and 
the community interact with The 
Daily. Newsrooms all over the 
country that have much greater 
resources and experience than we 
do are tackling these same issues, 
but the benefit of being a student-
run paper is that there is greater 
leeway to take risks and make 
mistakes.

The Daily is unique in that 

we serve as the only five-day 
circulation 
paper 
in 
all 
of 

The classroom, dorm rooms 

and hallways, or even in passing 
walking 
around 
campus: 

That’s where University of 
Michigan students are most 
likely to fall victim to a bias 
incident, according to a log of 
self-reported data collected by 
the University’s Bias Response 
Team. The team’s online log 
tracked 80 individual bias 
incidents since this September, 
with 16 additional prior events 
occurring over the summer.

Most cases in the log involve 

race, 
religion 
or 
national 

identity. Encompassed in the 
BRT’s scope are any instances 
in which a student is targeted 
for their identity, including 
but not limited to race, color, 
ethnicity, national origin, sex, 
gender identity or expression, 
sexual orientation, disability, 
age or religion. At the close 
of a semester rocked by high-
profile incidents of racism, 
the BRT records illustrate the 
majority of bias incidents are 
commonplace experiences that 
do not always make headlines. 
Most of the reports are attacks 
expressed 
verbally 
or 
in 

written form, either via email 
or graffiti.

“Regarding 
trends, 
there 

have been an increase in 
reported 
bias 
incidents 

that 
occur 
on-campus 
(vs 

off 
campus) 
since 
2014,” 

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen wrote in an 
email. “What you see reported 
is a testament to how much 
the community cares about 
reporting and supporting each 
other.”

Results 
from 
a 
campus 

climate 
sample 
survey 

administered last year found 
one in five students reported 
experiencing a discriminatory 
incident in the last year, with 
Black and Hispanic students 

519 percent and 132 percent 
more 
likely 
to 
experience 

discrimination, respectively.

Out of 21 incidents occurring 

in residence halls, West Quad 
Residence Hall surpasses all 
other residence halls with 
four incidents in the last three 
months, followed by Bursley 
Residence Hall and then Mary 
Markley residence hall on 
the Hill. A Central Campus 
Diversity Peer Educator who 

requested to stay anonymous 
due to University Housing 
policies 
explained 
dorms 

might 
be 
commonly 
cited 

locations of bias incidents due 
to strict policies in Housing 
surrounding 
reporting. 

DPEs are student residential 
staff 
members 
serving 
as 

social justice educators and 
developers 
of 
each 
hall’s 

community 
identity. 
The 

Distinguished author Tiya 

Miles, professor of American 
Culture and Afroamerican & 
African Studies spoke at the 
Rackham auditorium Friday to 
discuss her new book on racial 
history in the city of Detroit. 

In “The Dawn of Detroit: 

A Chronicle of Slavery and 
Freedom in the City of the 
Straits,” 
Miles 
offers 
an 

alternative origin story of 
Detroit. The book, according 
to her, “allows us to see 
Detroit’s 
beginning 
and 

industrial age ‘progress’ and 
recognize Detroit’s invisible 
ancestors.”

Miles argued that Detroit, 

which has a population that 
is over 80 percent Black, 
still “feels the aftershocks of 
systematic racism and white 
supremacy” prevalent in the 
18th century. For context, she 
presented 
African-American 

and Native American stories 
of 
enslavement 
as 
two 

adjacent entities that worked 
together to shape the dogma 
of the time. She discussed the

Each week, The Michigan 

Daily will be publishing a 
wrap-up of the most important 
bills proposed in Michigan 
Legislature over the past seven 
days:

HB 5321: State Rep. Triston 

Cole, R-Mancelona, introduced 
legislation 
which 
would 

prohibit the sterilization of 
deer as a method of population 
control. Cole told the Detroit 
Free Press he believes hunting 
is a more humane approach to 
the issue, as the tranquilization 
process causes stress for the 
animal.

“I was a hunting guide, 

so I strongly support the 
use of sportsmen for this 
activity. They pay to help 
manage wildlife species and 
that’s the direction that I 
want to continue to see the 
(Department 
of 
Natural 

Resources) use,” Cole said. 
“It’s the most cost-effective 
and efficient way to manage 
wildlife species, particularly 
in urban environments.”

MONDAY MEMORIES

current process of resolving 
bias incidents is fairly effective, 
the anonymous DPE suggested.

“Our 
purpose 
isn’t 
to 

convince a resident to think a 
certain way, be on a specific side, 
or make them do anything,” he 
said. “Our purpose is to have a 
dialogue with that resident and 
educate/help them understand 
the different sides. The students 
who commit the incidents are 
now more aware of their actions 
and understand the impact they 
make in their living spaces, and 
as a result no longer commit 
these incidents. In addition, 
the residents who are targeted 
know that they have a support 
system in their living spaces.”

Still, after Black residents 

in West Quad found racial 
slurs on their doors earlier this 
semester, many students of 
color at following protests asked 
if they were safe in their living 
spaces. LSA sophomore Travon 
Stearns was one of the students 
whose door was vandalized. In 

an earlier interview with The 
Daily, he lamented the lack of 
security he felt around campus. 
 

“Maybe people do those 

things as a joke but they don’t 
realize what psychologically 
impact that can have on a 
person,” he said. “Especially 
since I am at the University to 
study and get an education. But 
then I have to worry about the 
feeling of oppression and not 
being accepted. I have to watch 
my back at all times. And that 
just puts extra pressure on me 
on top of regular college life.”

Broekhuizen 
wrote 

University Housing offers an 
ongoing training program for 
student and professional staff 
on reporting and responding 
to 
incidents, 
as 
well 
as 

understanding “how a single 
incident can affect students 
in one community in diverse 
ways.”

“Prevention and mitigation 

of bias incidents begins with 
awareness,” she wrote. “It is 
key to have staff trained in how 
to defuse a situation where 
harm could take place, as well 
as on how to identify when a 

bias incident has occurred.”

The Central Campus DPE 

argues these incidents are on 
the minds of students involved, 
in when they are not in the 
headlines. 

“Over time, many residents 

have become numb to it even 
though the targeting is still 
occurring. This doesn’t mean 
that they aren’t affected by it or 
aren’t thinking about,” the DPE 
said. “The ‘feeling comfortable’ 
aspect of living in a residence 
hall fluctuates depending on 
what is occurring on campus.”

Fifteen of the incidents on 

the bias incident log involved 
University 
employees, 
and 

thus involved the Office for 
Institutional 
Equity, 
the 

campus office that handles 
discrimination and compliance.

Resolutions of bias incidents 

remain 
gap 
in 
the 
BRT, 

however. The team focuses on 
documentation and support of 
students, but not necessarily 
sanctioning 
perpetrators 

of 
identity-based 
attacks. 

These 
types 
of 
correctives 

fall 
under 
the 
domain 
of 

the 
Office 
of 
Student 

Conflict 
Resolution, 

the office charged with 
upholding the Statement 
of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities. The BRT, 
however, does not always 
refer students to OSCR or 
OIE.

Earlier this semester, 

E. Royster Harper, vice 
president for student life, 
said she was not aware of 
one bias incident resolved 
through OSCR processes. 
This 
year 
Central 

Student 
Government 

President 
Anushka 

Sarkar, an LSA senior, is 
trying to remedy that by 
amending the Statement 
of Students Rights and 
Responsibilities to include 
explicit language banning 
bias incidents.

“There 
are 
gaps 

between the Bias Response 
Team and OSCR, and 
we need to make sure 
students know how to use 
the codes,” Harper said. 
“But sometimes they just 
don’t want to report.”

stereotypical notion of an 
enslaved Black man working 
on a cotton plantation and 
instead offered a picture of 
society in which the main 
focus was the slavery of 
Native 
American 
women 

during the fur trade.

“Slavery 
and 
enslaved 

people 
both 
Native 
and 

African 
American 
were 

essential to the development 
of the city of Detroit,” she 
said. “They demonstrate the 
reach, depth and adaptability 
of 
the 
American 
slave 

trade, such as in the case of 
making Native women most 
vulnerable to enslavement. 
The 
ideas 
about 
inferior 

people were prepositioned by 
the ideas of slaves being used 
as a ‘resource.’”

In 
researching 
for 
the 

story Miles analyzed records 
from slaveholders such as 
John Askin and personalized 
stories of enslaved women 
such as Elizabeth “Lisette” 
Denison 
Forth, 
who 
was 

enslaved in Detroit in the 
early 1800s and later became 
a successful businesswoman.

According 
to 
Miles, 

personal 
accounts 
from 

these women are essentially 
untraceable, which made her 
work more difficult.

“Sources do not describe 

indigenous women with any 
specificity, their name is only 
sometimes 
included, 
their 

nation of origin occasionally, 
but they lack the narrative, 
let alone the accounts of their 
inner life,” she said.

Rackham 
student 
Nina 

Jackson 
Levin 
said 
she 

believes 
this 
story 
is 

essential to understanding 
the beginnings of the racial 
atmosphere of Detroit.

“By bringing Black and 

Native 
histories 
together 

in a historical context and 
applying 
that 
lens 
very 

proactively to Detroit, I think 
does something new, at the 
same time to something that 
is not at all a new story,” she 
said. “She bridges so many 

narratives in order to make 
them one cohesive story.”

Miles stressed these racial 

inequalities 
introduced 

above 
are 
still 
prevalent 

today –– his is especially true 
within the city of Detroit 
today. 

“Native people and Black 

people did not give in or back 
down,” Miles said. “People 
have done and will still do 
terrible things in the name of 
progress. However, we are the 
beneficiaries of the abuses and 
also the inheritors of sets of 
ideas and modes of action that 
help us to reveal and rewrite 
those wrongs.”

Rackham student Jallicia 

Jolly 
said 
she 
found 
the 

talk relevant to the current 
political climate.

“This 
subject 
is 
critical 

for 
not 
just 
knowledge 

production but to showcase 
how 
we 
are 
humanizing 

people in our everyday lives 
beyond academia,” Jolly said. 
“Conversations like these have 
to absolutely center around the 
lives of marginalized voices in 
this way. It is not just relevant 
in history and contemporary 
history, but also in our national 
and political landscape. It 
really shows how power is 
not just embodied, but how it 
is told in history, and how it 
shapes policy.”

Rackham student Aunrika 

Tucker-Shabazz expressed a 
similar sentiment.

“Conversations 
like 
this 

really throws the wrench in 
the discussion of power when 
we ask the question of who 
is winning at the expense of 
others, and this book really 
challenges this idea through 
its use of narratives, and 
through its focus on history,” 
Tucker-Shabazz said. “The 
question of ‘at whose expense’ 
and ‘at whose pocket’ allows 
a much more nuanced and 
robust critique of things that 
we categorically define as 
inequality and poverty.”

has been a controversial issue 
since first approved in August 
2015. City Council recently 
unveiled the city’s 2018 plan 
which increases the number 
of targeted deer from 100 to 
250.

Lorraine Shapiro, president 

of the Ann Arbor Non-Lethal 
Deer Management told The 
Daily in July that she believes 
sterilization is a more humane 
approach 
to 
population 

control.

“I feel it is inhumane to kill 

animals who are completely 
innocent,” 
Shapiro 
said. 

“They’re being punished for 
living, basically. This past 

winter, we were able to have 
the city agree to a plan where 
they would do culling and 
deer sterilization.”

Task Force reported that up 
to $7.46 billion in unfunded 
pension 
liabilities 
and 

$10.13 billion in unfunded 
healthcare liabilities exist in 

local 
governmental 

budgets.

House 
Republican 

spokesman 
Gideon 

D’Assandro 
told 
MLive 

the plan has been under 
development for some time 
but is finally nearly finished.

“They’ve all been talking 

about a consensus plan for 
months and this is the time 
when 
they’re 
starting 
to 

get close to an agreement,” 
D’Assandro said. 

Last December, a push for 

similar legislation was made 
but faced strong opposition 
from 
various 
municipal 

workers such as firefighters 
and 
police. 
Following 

protests, Gov. Rick Snyder 
formed the task force in order 
to gather further information 
on the issue.

WRAP-UP

pay tribute to the original art 
deco design and the modern 
technology that goes into the 
reproduction of the movies.”

The $8.5 million project 

to 
restore 
the 
75-year-

old venue began after the 
Michigan Theater Foundation 
purchased the State Theatre in 
2014. Prior to the renovation, 
the venue had narrow seating 
and curved screens in two 
auditoriums, 
the 
result 

of 
partitioning 
a 
single, 

larger screen. It also lacked 
accommodations for people 
with disabilities.

“It was uncomfortable. You 

kind of sat sideways to the 
screen,” Collins said. “We got 
a lot of complaints. The people 
in 
wheelchairs, 
you 
just 

couldn’t service them. Only 
the most able bodied were able 
to go to the movies.”

Despite 
“unforeseen 

circumstances” that delayed 
the ribbon cutting ceremony, 
the 
State 
Theatre 
was 

still able to open members 
of 
the 
Michigan 
Theater 

Foundation Friday and the 
general 
public 
Saturday, 

according to Diana York, who 
oversees marketing for the 
restoration campaign. York 
said the ribbon ceremony 
will be rescheduled, most 
likely to celebrate the 75th 
anniversary of the cinema.

At its construction, the 

State Theatre was the “only 
theatre 
actually 
designed 

for the sole use of showing 
motion 
picture,” 
according 

to a 1942 Daily article. It 
stands just down the street 
from the Michigan Theater, 
which opened in 1928 to 
show silent films. C. Howard 
Crane, a prolific architect who 
designed numerous theaters 
around the country including 
the Fox Theatre and the 
Fillmore, both in Detroit, also 
designed the State Theatre.

Henry Aldridge, a former 

professor of film at Eastern 
Michigan 
University 
and 

volunteer organist for the 
Michigan Theater, said the 
State was bigger than the 
Michigan 
Theater 
by 
200 

seats when it first opened.

“It was considered very 

modern at the time when it 
opened,” Aldridge said. “It 
was fully air conditioned, 
which was very unusual in the 
1940’s. It had seats that popped 
up when you got up. You didn’t 
have to flip your seat up, they 
came up by themselves — little 

things like that.”

Aldridge 
formed 

the 
Michigan 
Theater 

Foundation in the 1970s to 
stop plans to turn the venue 
into a food court. For more 
than a decade, the Michigan 
Theater has overseen the 
film scheduling at the State 
Theatre. Aldridge said the 
four new screens in the 
State Theatre, in addition to 
the three in the Michigan, 
provide great opportunities 
for dynamic programming. 

“There are not many cities 

that have two historic theaters 
within a half a block of each 
other, both of which are 
going to be fully operational,” 
Aldridge said. “What makes 
the State special is that it’s 
been saved, or at least a part 
of it has, and that it will be 
a state-of-the-art screening 
facility for the University 
community, for the citizens of 
Ann Arbor and the region.”

With its four screens, the 

State now offers 360 seats in 
total.

Shows 
on 
Friday 
were 

cancelled temporarily in one 
auditorium due to projection 
issues. 
The 
problem 
was 

resolved shortly thereafter, 
allowing 
for 
the 
rest 
of 

the 
weekend’s 
scheduled 

programming to resume.

LSA senior Andrea Sahouri 

saw the “The Disaster Artist” 
starring James Franco at the 
State Theatre Saturday night.

“I thought the theater was 

amazing,” Sahouri said. “I like 
how they kept it looking how it 
did before. They didn’t change 
too much, which keeps its 
character. They didn’t change 
it visually too much. I can’t 
imagine the work that was put 
into it, but it’s really great.”

In addition to new releases 

like “Lady Bird,” starring 
Saoirse Ronan, the opening 
weekend 
movie 
lineup 

included “The Big Lebowski” 
and 
“The 
Rocky 
Horror 

Picture Show.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Phoenix 

Vavzincak played Janet in 
the shadow cast of the “The 
Rocky Horror Picture Show” 
at the Michigan Theater in 
late October. She said the 
State Theatre’s screening of 
the 1975 cult classic is better 
suited to “die-hards” rather 
than casual viewers.

“I 
think 
the 
difference 

between the State and the 
Michigan Theater is when 
you go to the State Theatre 
to see something like ‘Rocky 
Horror,’ then you get the real 
die-hards, you get the feeling 
of what Rocky Horror was 
originally about,” she said. 

“It’s a small scale, and you get 
to watch the movie and relate 
to it. At the Michigan Theater, 
I feel like that’s when it can 
become the big event that it is 
when we did the shadow cast 
and everyone came.”

Vavzincak said she’d prefer 

to continue putting on the 
shadow cast at the Michigan 
Theater, where the Halloween 
showing of “Rocky Horror” 
sold 
out 
the 
1,700 
seat 

auditorium.

“You couldn’t expect to 

be doing that type of a show 
when they play it at the State 
Theatre, because the State 
Theatre is a more personal 
feel and I think the Michigan 
Theater makes more of a 
spectacle with it,” Vavzincak 
said.

Collins, 
an 
Ann 
Arbor 

resident, remembers going to 
“Fantasia” and “Jaws” as a kid 
at the State Theatre, he said 
movies play a key role in the 
way people tell stories.

“I don’t know whether it’s 

because it resonates with that 
primordial sense of sitting 
around a campfire, hearing a 
shaman tell a great tribal story 
about your culture, about your 
time, about life’s transitions 
and that kind of thing that 
goes back to prehistory, or 
because with a movie, it’s 
brilliant storytellers telling a 
story with flickering light,” he 
said.

Regardless of why people go 

to the movies, Collins said, he 
is optimistic about the future 
of the theaters like the State 
and Michigan.

“Even though people can 

watch movies at home, they 
still like to get out in a crowd 
and do it,” he said. “That’s why 
movies aren’t going away. It’s a 
legacy art form that resonates 
deeply with the human psyche. 
That’s why we invested all of 
this time, money, energy and 
enthusiasm in preserving a 
movie exhibition piece.”

Washtenaw County. This means 
our audience is split between 
Ann Arborites and U-M students. 
With the data from a several-year 
readership survey and our new 
analytics team, we are seeking 
to engage our audience in more 
ways than ever before. We found 
community members are more 
likely to pick up a physical copy 
of the paper than students, who 
read our stories on the mobile site 
or social media pages; this affects 
what we decide to put on the front 
page. The physical paper tends to 
have stories on 1A that pertain to 
administration or the city, whereas 
the homepage of the website will 
often feature stories related to 
student life.

We are very interested in how 

readers engage with Daily content. 
The Daily recently launched the 
second beta version of our content 
app and will have it up on the 
App Store in coming weeks. This 
semester we also launched two 
new podcasts. We’re focused on 
increasing engagement on social 
media by looking at our post 
analytics and making headlines 
SEO- and social media-optimized, 
as well as putting a greater focus on 
bolstering our video team.

Our greatest successes, though, 

have been in evergreen content 
such as the campus map and LSA 
Grade Guide. In the making of the 
grade guide, we submitted FOIAs 
for class grade distributions so 
students registering can see the 

ranges of grades for classes. Despite 
being published over a year ago, the 
grade guideis consistently one of 
our most-read pieces. Currently, we 
are working on increasing the data 
and making grade guides for other 
colleges within the University of 
Michigan.

As media is changing, we 

are working to be a resource for 
students and are thinking critically 
about how to distribute our content 
and engage with our audience in 
new ways. It’s been a challenge 
rife with trial and error, but it’s a 
welcome one.

Mike Allen, co-founder and 

executive editor, Axios

Thank you to Emma and her 

colleagues at The Michigan Daily 
for welcoming Axios to campus 
for our Smarter Faster Revolution 
event this Wednesday at Ross 
School of Business, from 1 to 2 p.m. 
(sharp – we know you finals to study 
for). RSVP here.

I’ll lead a trio of rapid-fire 

conversations with three top CEOs: 
Postmates’ Bastian Lehmann on 
“The Era of the Entrepreneur,” 
Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase 
& Co. on “Defining the Future of 
Work” and TaskRabbit’s Stacy 
Brown-Philpot 
on 
“Tech-Tonic 

Changes at Work.”

Why it matters: We’re building 

Axios to make people smarter, 
faster with news and information 
they can trust on the topics that will 
shape the world that Emma and her 
fellow Wolverines will run.

Axios is Greek for “worthy,” and 

the Smarter Faster Revolution is 
aimed at helping college students 
– 
our 
future 
bosses! 
– 

share 
worthy information 

on business, tech, media trends, 
politics, the future of work, the 
world, science and more. 

My favorite word in Emma’s 

article is “data.” I love that you’re 
trying to understand your readers, 
which will allow you to serve them 
better. When we wrote the Axios 
Manifesto, our first principle was: 
“Reader first!” We’re obsessed 
with reaching the most demanding 
news consumers with our efficient 
“smart brevity” format. We tell you 
“What’s new” and “Why it matters,” 
and skip all the white noise we’re so 
used to seeing in the media.

Another reason I loved your 

piece was your evident enthusiasm 
for serving the whole campus 
community. I had a blast on my 
college paper – The Ring-tum Phi, 
at Washington and Lee University 
in Virginia – and it gave me the 
bug for the fun life I have lived 
since then. Along with the honor 
of interviewing the world’s leaders 
and pioneers, I was scolded by a 
nun for opening my laptop in the 
Vatican, and was yelled at by my 
more senior colleagues when I got 
in the wrong van when babysitting 
a dinner run by President Bill 
Clinton. 

The findings by Emma and The 

Daily about the campus audience 
are very resonant with our theory 
of the case: The way for a news 
organization to win today is to be 
where the audience is, whether 
they want to watch, listen or read. 
The old days of getting automatic 
eyeballs – when people picked up 
the paper out of habit, or turned 
on the tube at a specific time – are 
gone. Now, we’re in minute-by-
minute war for attention.

The question of ‘at 

whose expense’ 
and ‘at whose 
pocket’ allows 
a much more 
nuanced and 
robust critique 
of things that 

we categorically 

define as 

inequality and 

poverty

It’s a legacy 
art form that 

resonates 
deeply with 
the human 

psyche


I 

really just cannot bear 
it 
any 
longer. 
In 
the 

aftermath 
of 
the 
2016 

presidential election, and even 
somewhat 
before 

then, I had heard 
about this mysterious 
phenomenon 
by 

which 
Americans 

became 
unable 
to 

stomach 
another 

headline, 
another 

minute 
of 
CNN 

programming 
or 

another picture of 
Donald Trump. As 
a 
political 
junkie, 

though, this phenomenon had 
never affected me; the palace 
intrigue, 
celebrity 
feuds, 

party 
infighting, 
scandalous 

revelations, love and loss — I 
was tuned into all of it with 
laser focus. 

However, 
the 
eight 

weeks since the avalanche 
of 
allegations 
of 
sexual 

harassment, 
sexual 
assault 

and rape hit Harvey Weinstein 
squarely in the chest have been 
just exhausting. And not just 
for the brave women who have 
come forward, but for me too.

With each new day comes 

another name that needs to be 
dragged in the mud. And it’s not 
just the Roy Moores of the world, 
the presidentially-endorsed evil 
and hypocrisy you might expect. 
No, it’s been beloved television 
stars like Louis C.K, Kevin 
Spacey and Jeffrey Tambor (God 
help us if something scandalous 
comes out about Bryan Cranston 
or Ty Burrell, or next year’s 
Emmy’s will be so depressing), 
charming politicians like Al 
Franken and trusted newsmen 
like Charlie Rose. Creeps, it 
seems, one and all. Allegations 
like these have come out in 
the past, but something is 
profoundly different this time. 
Namely, I never watched much of 
The Cosby Show and I’ve always 
been lukewarm on Bill Clinton, 
so I wasn’t that disappointed.

What’s 
perhaps 
most 

infuriating about all this is 
that the discussions that have 
been sparked in the wake of 
this 
so-called 
“Weinstein 

effect” are not the right ones. 
Unimpeachable 
outlets 
we 

all 
trust 
to 
provide 
sober, 

thoughtful commentary on the 
news of the day have instead 
chosen 
to 
tackle 
issues 
of 

variable, though all secondary, 
importance. I’m talking about 

the elite class of journalists on 
Fox & Friends, Morning Joe, the 
Blaze and pretty much all CNN 
programming. What does all of 

this mean for 2018, 
they ask? What do 
Trump voters think 
of all this? What’s 
worse: 
a 
criminal 

or a Democrat? And 
why is our society 
one that is inherently 
hostile to victims and 
institutionally sexist? 
Important questions, 
one and all.

None 
of 
them 

attack the very root of the 
problem. We need a better 
vetting process, so that men like 
this are not elevated to positions 
of power in the first place — 
whether that comes in the form 
of political office, celebrity or 
regular time on a television 
network. After all, what do we 
have in place now? Scrutiny from 
the media and public opinion? 
Clearly, our investigative powers 
are subpar at the moment.

The natural solution would 

be to add a layer of scrutiny. 
For each potential office holder, 
Hollywood star or television 
icon, why not consult a group of 
people with intimate knowledge 
of their lives? The first three 
members of such a commission 
could be chosen from among 
the applicant’s ex-girlfriends, 
at random. Some of them may 
have parted on good terms, but 
there will have been a messy 
break-up or two in the mix and 
those are voices we need to hear 
as well. Next, a low-level staffer 
at Wikileaks looking to prove 
themselves. I’m not entirely 
sure what the dark web is, but I 
want to know what’s on it about 
a potential senator or whomever 
might star in the next hit Netflix 
series. Then, to round things out, 
a casual acquaintance — friends 
on Facebook, but not close — 
from their high school years 
could share the juiciest gossip 
that was circulating about them 
40 years ago.

Forget 
bland 
statements 

from senior members of their 
own 
party 
or 
nominations 

from the Academy, these are 
the endorsements I care about. 
The public could count on their 
absolute honesty. Only truly 
worthy candidates with squeaky 
clean records would receive all 
five yeses. Two to four votes 
would make it a judgment call 

for each individual voter and 
anything below that would be 
an immediate red flag. These 
committees of five would single-
handedly revolutionize primaries 
and casting calls. Think how 
much time, column inches and 
heartache we’d owe them!

But then again, as I think 

about it, that would be a 
logistical nightmare. Plus, there 
are too many potential holes in 
the system. We need something 
simpler, cleaner.

So naturally my mind turns 

to eunuchs. Harassing women 
would be a lot harder without 
a sex drive. And what ever 
happened to them? For hundreds 
of years, they played important 
roles at court, in religion and 
in 
entertainment. 
Nowadays 

they’re 
little 
more 
than 
a 

gimmick on Game of Thrones. 
It wouldn’t be a requirement by 
any means — don’t be ridiculous. 
Instead, it’d be more of a strong 
suggestion. People could even 
frame it in a folksy way. “Well 
everyone knows, if you want to 
get elected in the Wisconsin 1st, 
you’ve got to be like a Ken doll 
down there!” 

See the problem with that 

is I’m not sure any man is so 
obsessed with power, committed 
to public service or needy for 
fame 
that 
they’d 
willingly 

submit themselves to that kind 
of lifestyle. There might be a few, 
but not enough to fill both houses 
of Congress.

All seemed lost, as though we 

were condemned to a world run 
by perverts. Then it hit me like a 
ton of bricks. All of this scandal, 
scrutiny 
and 
disappointment 

has one common denominator. 
They’re all men.

We could just elect women, 

watch shows starring women 
and get our news from women. 
I’ve never been represented in 
Congress by a woman, but it 
seems like the safer bet. I’d like 
to try it sometime soon; “Veep” 
is consistently funny, and I’ve 
always enjoyed Martha Raddatz. 
Ever heard of sexual misconduct 
from 
Debbie 
Stabenow 
or 

Julia Louis-Dreyfus? Probably 
not. Until the culture shift is 
complete, electing men and 
then hoping that resignation or 
public shaming will be enough 
to right the wrong is just too 
risky. That horse is already out 

S

ome people know exactly 
what they want to be 
when they grow up. I am 

not one of those people. When 
I started my first semester of 
college, the only thing I knew 
was I wanted to study a subject 
that would allow me to help and 
support people.

My 
adviser 
recommended 

an 
introductory 
course 
in 

biomedical science because at 
first, I wanted to explore going 
into medicine. To put it nicely, I 
did not enjoy the class one bit and 
knew this type of science was 
not for me. Then, I began to take 
classes in psychology, religion, 
women’s studies and sociology. I 
decided to pursue psychology, so 
I could go down multiple paths 
that would allow me to work 
with individuals in any field.

In 
these 
courses 
and 

conversations with friends and 
family, I have realized that I 
want to go into social work one 
day. But first, I must finish up 
my degree, and this will take 
about another year and a half. I 
think it’s extremely frustrating 
that after my first two years of 
college, I feel like I am ready 
to apply to graduate school, 
but instead I have to continue 
courses for graduation and major 
requirements.

So, I’m here taking classes that 

do not build off of one another, 
where I feel like I am learning 
the same thing over and over 
again. Every once in a while, 
I learn something new, but it 
doesn’t feel profound. I am aware 
some fields of study have courses 
that build from one to the next, 
but not every field does. I’m just 
filling my audit checklist so that 
I can get my degree and move 
on to greater things. It feels 
incredibly 
meaningless 
and, 

honestly, like a waste of time.

I find this pathetic. I am sad 

that I feel like I am wasting 
money, time and energy taking 
courses I don’t have interest 
in nor will teach me the skills 
to grow and learn. It makes 

it feel like I’m here only for 
the diploma, just waiting to 
graduate. I am here to just go 
through the motions until I can 
reach the finish line.

I know some would argue they 

learned so much from a full four 
years of undergraduate school or 
taking those college requirements 
changed their entire field of 
study and impacted what they 
do now. I see this in the way LSA 
has Race and Ethnicity and area 
distribution 
requirements 
to 

give us opportunities to discover 
new fields and to become well-
rounded graduates. However, 
this 
learning 
can 
definitely 

happen in a shorter amount of 
time than four years.

I never imagined my college 

experience to be so repetitive, 
mundane and even bureaucratic. 
I have many friends who feel 
the same way. It’s not that we 
don’t want to have extra time to 
be with our friends for another 
year or two, enjoying our social 
lives and student organizations; 
it just feels like the institution 
of undergraduate education is 
not respectful of students’ time 
and money.

I have friends who have 

changed majors or transferred 
programs between schools and 
are now required to take extra 
semesters. I even have friends 
who started off taking fewer 
credits after consulting with 
advisers and now have to take 
an extra semester. They then 
have to spend more time and 
money to take requirements that 
will ultimately just result in one 
sheet of paper.

I can’t help but see the way 

this impacts the higher education 
industry. A bachelor’s degree 
is the new minimum required 
for many careers. Still, some 
would argue a bachelor’s degree 
is the new high school diploma, 
because students regardless of 
major are not guaranteed a job 
with just their undergraduate 
degree. This indicates students 
will have to complete graduate 

degrees on top of all of these years 
of education — which ends up 
requiring more time, and, unless 
the graduate degree is funded or 
subsidized, more money.

Graduate degrees are going 

to be the new way to guarantee 
you are knowledgeable in your 
field. 
This 
means 
students 

are spending more money to 
get degrees at higher ranking 
undergraduate institutions or 
getting graduate degrees that 
expands their debt before they 
enter the workforce.

I think we need to take a closer 

look at our institutions of higher 
education and see if students are 
truly gaining what we deserve 
from the way programs are 
designed. We spend thousands 
of 
dollars 
every 
semester 

expecting to learn new things, 
be challenged and graduate in a 
timely manner.

Some smaller or more elite 

colleges have programs that 
are designed to give students 
more freedom. One program 
is Open Curriculum at Brown 
University, where students have 
the flexibility to study and take 
classes they want. Brown makes 
curriculum 
suggestions, 
and 

students can opt to use these or 
create their own paths.

With all of this to consider, 

I will still need to finish my 
undergraduate 
degree 
to 

apply for a job or master’s 
degree programs if I want to 
be successful in a society that 
values 
professionalism 
and 

wealth. So, here I am — just 
taking my courses and trying 
my best to get the most out 
of my current situation. The 
way undergraduate education 
is 
designed 
at 
big 
public 

universities will not just change 
overnight. As students, we have 
every right to point out the flaws 
in this system because it will 
ultimately affect our futures as 
individuals and as a society.

Rethink undergraduate degrees

“A

re you sure that 
sitting at the front 
of the class won’t 

help?” “Are you sure it’s not 
that you just aren’t paying 
attention?” “Why can’t you just 
get a translator?”

Since my diagnosis as hard-

of-hearing at 14, I have heard 
these types of questions from 
many of the adults in my life. 
These 
questions 
make 
me 

cringe; I always get the feeling 
that the asker thinks they know 
more about my disability than 
I do. While I understand those 
who ask these questions mean 
well, they reflect ignorance 
surrounding the issues of not 
only the deaf and hard-of-
hearing community, but the 
disabled community as a whole. 
All of these questions have 
made me wonder: What type 
of training and how much of it 
do educators receive to support 
disabled students?

The answer? Very little. 

Current teacher training does 
not seem to be servicing the 
students that need the most 
support. As of 2007, the average 
general education teacher only 
takes about 1.5 courses with 
a major focus on inclusion or 
special education. Additionally, 
university and job site training 
does little to prepare teachers 
for the situations they might 
face teaching students with 
disabilities.

Looking 
back, 
I 
have 

experienced problems dealing 
with educators because of the 
lack of training they receive. 
Mostly, it is the occasional 
snarky comment on how I am 
just not paying attention in 
class or that I should change my 
behavior to make my own life 
easier — believe me, if I could 
I would. I hope if educators 
are trained better on disability 

education, there might be a 
realization that these comments 
are insensitive and misguided.

It is natural to wonder why a 

general education teacher would 
need special education training 
in the first place. In the past, 
general education teachers did 
not need this training, as they 
only dealt with “traditional” 
students. Today, however, there 
is a push to include special 
education students in general 
education classrooms.

Studies 
show 
this 
push 

for inclusion has a variety of 
benefits for a special needs 
student. A 2017 article from The 
Atlantic 
explains, 
“Students 

with disabilities who are placed 
in general-education classrooms 
get more instructional time, 
have 
fewer 
absences, 
and 

have 
better 
post-secondary 

outcomes.” For students who 
have 
social 
or 
behavioral 

issues, being incorporated in 
a general education classroom 
helps them develop greater 
social skills. Because of the 
benefits that disabled students 
receive, 
schools 
should 

continue to integrate special 
education students into their 
general education classrooms. 
Consequently, teachers should 
receive training that will allow 
them to cater to the needs of a 
variety of students.

At the University of Michigan, 

the School of Education does 
not mention an explicit special 
education 
requirement 
for 

their elementary or secondary 
education 
programs. 
Most 

university education programs 
do not emphasize training on 
the needs of special education 
students, and the University 
of Michigan is no exception — 
but we need to set an example 
for other universities to follow. 
The University needs to update 

its 
requirements, 
especially 

as schools move to integrate 
special education students and 
students with disabilities into 
its classrooms.

Training 
programs 
will 

better prepare educators for 
the adaptability necessary to 
teach disabled students. It is 
obvious each student’s needs are 
different, regardless of whether 
they are a disabled student 
or not. For myself, I am very 
independent and do not need 
much assistance. As I said earlier, 
I mostly deal with insensitive 
questions or people who refuse 
to modify their speaking so I can 
understand them.

However, 
some 
students 

with physical, behavioral or 
emotional 
disabilities 
need 

more support to succeed. An 
important part of this kind 
of training is learning how to 
adjust teaching styles to the 
needs of the student. The lack 
of training current teachers 
have makes it difficult for 
them to adapt the way they 
need to in order to support 
disabled students.

I am excited schools are 

becoming 
more 
willing 

to 
include 
students 
with 

disabilities in their classrooms. 
Strong evidence points to the 
success disabled students who 
are taught in a general education 
classroom can have. However, 
we need to start preparing our 
educators for teaching a wider 
variety of students. It is unfair 
of us to expect teachers will just 
know how to support a disabled 
student without the proper 
training. Universities and job 
training programs need to aid 
teachers by requiring special 
education courses and training.

DAILY LITERATURE COLUMN

Coming to terms with 

Middle English literature

Rediscovering literary classics through one woman’s story

I wasn’t always the type of 

person who liked reading really 
old texts. I was one of those people 
who thought that most of the 
“classics,” with a few exceptions, 
were boring. I’ve always loved 
reading and writing, of course, and 
I had planned on being an English 
major long before I got to college. 
But when my high school English 
teachers would assign books like 
“Beowulf” and “Middlemarch,” as 
weird as it might sound, it would 
often be hard for me to muster up 
any real interest.

I’ve gradually found, though, 

that whether or not I appreciate 
a text has a lot less to do with 
whether or not it’s old, and more to 
do with what it is and how I come 
across it. (“How I come across 
it” is my subtle way of saying 
that not all of my high school 
English teachers were excellent 
motivators) I do actually like a lot 
of classic literature. My gateway 
book was “Catch-22,” and within 
the past few years I’ve found 
myself getting really impassioned 
about writers like Shakespeare 
and Jane Austen, more than I 
really would have expected of 
myself toward the beginning of 
high school.

It makes sense, then, that 

college should introduce me to a 
ton of amazing historical writers 
whom I may not have given as 
much of a chance when I was 
younger. Recently, my thoughts 
have been stuck on one of these 
writers in particular: Julian of 
Norwich.

I first learned about Julian of 

Norwich last year, and recently 
revisited 
her 
in 
my 
Horror 

Literature class (which I would 
highly recommend). To me, Julian 
is a prime example of the ways 
in which writing both intersects 
with history and stands outside of 
it, depending on how you look at it.

Julian of Norwich lived in 

England in the 14th century and 
wrote a series of revelations, 
or “shewings,” that are now 
considered to make up the first 
known English book known to 
have been written by a woman. 

The 
shewings 
documented 

a series of visions she had at 
the age of 30, when she took 
seriously ill and thought she 
was on her deathbed. The 
visions, which she described 
vividly, included a bleeding 
crucifix and several images 
of Jesus Christ. Julian would 
go on to become an anchoress, 
meaning that she secluded herself 
from society, voluntarily and 
completely, as an act of devotion to 
her Christian faith. Anchoresses 

were rare and venerated, and the 
amount of personal conviction 
that it took to decide to become 
one meant that they were deeply 
respected.

The history of Julian’s life is 

very interesting, from her detailed 
visions to her life as an anchoress. 
Her writing itself is also incredibly 
visual 
and 
eloquent. 
Middle 

English writing may feel distant or 
foreign to us instinctively, which 
in some ways I think is justified 
— I, for one, had never heard of 
anchoresses before I learned about 
Julian, and I’d never really read 
anything older than Shakespeare. 
I’m also not Christian. It would 
make sense, then, for all of this 
to feel somewhat alien to me at 
first glance. But early texts such 
as Julian’s provide us with one 
of the most straightforward keys 
to better understanding not only 
what people’s lives were like 
during the Middle Ages, but also 
how they thought and what was 
important to them. As the oldest 
published work written by a 
woman and one of the oldest works 
of English literature in general, 
Julian’s revelations is a crucial 
piece in the never-ending puzzle 
of understanding our own history 
and our own nature. That’s what 
I love maybe more than anything 
else about literature, what gets me 
so excited about it: The idea that 
because somebody cared enough 
about something to write it down, 
you have a kind of opportunity to 
meet that person, even from miles 
and centuries away.

Which Franco is your favorite? Tweet @ us @michigandaily
‘Disaster’ is not a disaster

The movie, starring the Francos, is the creation story of a cult hit

With a movie as infamous 

as “The Room” and a figure as 
idiosyncratic as Tommy Wiseau, 
it would have been all too easy to 
make “The Disaster Artist” — the 
story behind that much-maligned 
film’s production — a straight-up 
comedy. The laughs would have 
come easy through the simple 
reproduction 
of 
scenes, 
and 

caricaturizing Wiseau’s already 
larger-than-life personality would 
have provided star James Franco 
(“The Deuce”) with easy, hammy 
fodder.

Instead, the final product walks 

a much more difficult, but much 
more rewarding, line. The best 
comedies exist at the intersection 
of humor and heart; they make 
their audience laugh, of course, but 
they don’t forget the humanity of 
the characters delivering the jokes. 
“The Disaster Artist” accomplishes 
this perfectly. Not only is it every bit 
as hilarious as fans of the “‘Citizen 
Kane’ of bad movies” would hope, 
but it provides a surprisingly 
poignant 
look 
at 
filmmaking, 

unlikely friendship and unlikelier 
success.

At the center of the film 

is 
Franco-as-Wiseau 
in 
the 

most 
ironically 
Oscar 
caliber 

performance of the year. I was 
initially wary of Franco casting 
himself in the role, both for that 
aforementioned fear that Tommy 
would be the butt of one too many 
jokes and because, shallow human 

being that I am, he didn’t quite 
look the part in the trailers and 
promotional materials. All my fears 
were assuaged within moments. 
In context, Franco completely 
inhabits the role, mining comedy 
not from peculiar mannerisms but 
from Tommy’s interactions with 
other characters — his reaction to 
the acting playing Chris-R (yes, 
that hyphen is in the film), setting 
up a later reveal which plays almost 
as a metatextual twist, is one of the 
biggest laughs of the year.

Even better than his comedic 

moments are the times when 
Franco, also in the director’s chair, 
lets the drama flow. “The Disaster 
Artist” doesn’t shy away from 
how hard rejection can be, even 
to seemingly unstoppable forces 
of nature like Tommy, as shown 
by an almost heartbreaking quiet 
scene between him and Greg 
Sestero (Dave Franco, “Nerve”), 
his best friend and future costar. 
The filming of one of “The Room”’s 
many sex scenes, on the other hand, 
plays out as if in terrifying slow 
motion, building to a blistering 
confrontation between Tommy 
and Paul Scheer’s (“The League”) 

Raphael Smadja, the film’s director 
of photography, over Tommy’s 
harsh treatment of his female lead.

The rest of the cast is terrific, as 

well. The younger Franco brother’s 
portrayal of Sestero is arguably the 
main character of the movie — it’s 
predominantly told from his point 
of view, in any case, as the writer 
of the excellent book on which 
“The Disaster Artist” is based — 
and while his role is much more 
thankless than that of his brother, 
he is never completely upstaged. 
Seth Rogen (“Steve Jobs”) stands 
out from the packed supporting 
cast as the perpetually nonplussed 
script supervisor and de facto 
director, Sandy Schklair. As teased 
by the first trailer, the scene in 
which he must guide Tommy 
through the legendary “Oh, hi 
Mark” scene is one of the best the 
film has to offer.

The cast list from there on 

down is mostly celebrity cameos 
— even Dave Franco’s real life wife, 
Alison Brie (“GLOW”), is mostly 
relegated to the sidelines playing 
his onscreen girlfriend — but these 
are never too gratuitous, and the 
elder Franco is wise to keep the 
focus on Tommy and Greg. This 
is their story. “The Room,” for 
how insane a motion picture it is, 
sprung from their friendship, and 
“The Disaster Artist” is at its best 
when it allows their relationship 
and their personalities to supply 
the comedy and the drama. When 
it works, and it almost always does, 
the movie about their movie is an 
almost unparalleled, pitch perfect 
comedy.

FILM REVIEW

HBO

It was ok.
Daily Arts Roundtable 
presents: ‘Curb’ finale

I don’t know if you guys heard, 

but “Curb Your Enthusiasm” came 
back. Oh, you did? Well. With such 
an influential and widely lauded 
show returning for a ninth season, 
a few Daily Arts writers had to 
sit down and hash out some final 
thoughts.

Nabeel Chollampat: So, I guess 

we’ll start with the big question: 
Was “Curb” good this year?

Connor Grady: For “Curb,” 

the overall season was incredibly 
inconsistent 
from 
episode-to-

episode, and not in a good way. 
The highly-touted revival season 
started slow by focusing on Larry’s 
fatwa, which was neither funny nor 
compelling. Seeing the bald David 
in a shitty, long-haired disguise 
worked for a couple cheap laughs, 
but never more than that. Once the 
series started to transition away 
from this storyline, it had much 
more success, with David turning 
in a couple of strong episodes in 
the middle of the season, led by 
“Running With the Bulls.”

Unfortunately, these episodes 

were 
sandwiched 
between 
a 

couple of complete duds in “A 
Disturbance in the Kitchen” and 
“Namaste.” Both of these entries 
struggled to find their footing in 
terms of humor and came off as 
forced, as David leaned entirely 
on his tried-and-true gags, like 
his 
infamous 
stare-downs. 

Worse, even, were “Never Wait 
for Seconds!” and “The Pickle 
Gambit,” which were both lazily 
written misfires.

That’s easily my biggest gripe 

with this season of “Curb” — the 
whole season felt like a montage 

of classic Larry moments copied 
and pasted into a new context. The 
nostalgia factor was apparently 
too high for David, who chose 
to spend much of the season 
reminiscing about old jokes from 
the series rather than developing 
new ones. “Curb” was not good 
this year.

Joey Schuman: Connor has a 

point. I’d even take it a step further 
by claiming that this season fully 
killed the grace period for Larry’s 
asshole naivete. Consider the “chat 
‘n’ cut.” Larry taught us this lesson 
in season eight, and it exemplified 
everything 
great 
about 
the 

show: exposing the hypocrisy in 
‘standard’ human behavior, out-
hacking others’ lifehacks, that 
type of thing. When Larry tried to 
repeat the same magic this season, 
like with the tong / cookie fiasco 
in “The Pickle Gambit,” it felt like 
elementary humor. There were 
very few moments this season 
where I found myself thinking, 
‘wow, that’s quite an innovative 
way to be a complete prick.’ So 
yeah, I guess I wanted something 
more fresh.

N: Yes! The chat ‘n’ cut! Give me 

more of that! If there’s one way, 
I think, to summarily say what 
I felt was missing this season, 
it’d be that: no classic scenes or 
moments, no quotable phrases or 
new additions to the “Seinfeld” 
/ 
“Curb” 
Extended 
Universe 

lexicon. And if there were, they 
felt forced, like Larry David was 
simply playing the “Greatest Hits” 
and hoping people would like it.

Which brings me to episodes 

like, say, “The Pickle Gambit.” 
I agree, Connor, that that was 
a dud of an episode, but I think 
it’s kind of a microcosm of what 
this season of “Curb” was for 

me: inconsistent. The idea — 
Larry, Leon, Funkhouser and 
Funkhouser’s 
prodigal-son 

nephew brawling to open a pickle 
jar, which results in the nephew 
breaking his pitching elbow and 
subsequently renders him unable 
to jack off — is hilarious. It’s one 
of those quintessentially “Curb” 
moments; I love it. But then there’s 
an extremely uncomfortable sex 
scene with our friend from the best 
“Curb” episode ever, “Palestinian 
Chicken,” and I feel weird. That’s 
what I think about whether the 
show was good this season: I 
laughed, but I also felt weird.

J: So, going off of that, what 

were your guys’ favorite episodes 
or moments from this season?

C: For me, it would easily 

be David facing off against his 
frail, 
plant-thieving 
neighbor, 

Rose Shapiro (Carol Herman, 
“Freaky Deaky”), on “Judge Judy” 
during what is easily the season’s 
top 
episode, 
“The 
Shucker.” 

Everything about this scene was 
perfect — Leon’s (J.B. Smoove, 
“The Millers”) ridiculous witness 
testimony, David’s questioning of 
the court’s tap water, and Shapiro’s 
before-and-after pictures of the 
plant.

Beyond David’s hilarious court-

room antics, I also loved the entire 
eulogy scene from “Running With 
the Bulls.” I’ll never forget Marty 
Funkhouser’s 
(Bob 
Einstein, 

“Arrested Development”) deadpan 
look after Larry crashed his 
nephew’s funeral. Larry’s half-
assed apology afterwards deserves 
to be in the “Curb” hall of fame, if 
one existed.

Michigan tops Bruins thanks to 15-point comeback

Blink, and you might have 

missed the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s comeback.

Blink 
again, 
and 
you 

wouldn’t have seen UCLA 
take back control of the game.

If you blinked a third time, 

an apology is due.

Despite 
lackadaisical 

frontcourt 
defense 
and 

inconsistent 
shooting 
that 

resulted in a 15-point deficit, 
Michigan used a late run led 
by junior forward Moritz 
Wagner 
and 
sophomore 

guard Zavier Simpson to 
push the game into overtime, 
where the Wolverines flew 
past the Bruins to win, 78-69.

“These last stretches we 

just all looked each other in 
the eye and we said we’re 
gonna ride or die regardless 
of the results,” said redshirt 
sophomore 
Charles 

Matthews. “So when we came 
out there we said, ‘Look, if 
we lose we lose, but let’s go 
out there like some dogs, like 

some soldiers. Lay it out on the 
line.’ ”

Trailing by six points late 

in the second half, Wagner 
hit two 3-pointers and added 
a fast-break dunk to trim 
the deficit to two — UCLA’s 
smallest lead since 4:15 in 
the first half. Wagner also 
brought a defensive intensity 
previously unseen in the 
contest to stymie the Bruins’ 
low-post offense.

From there, the undoing 

of UCLA’s lead came at the 
hands of Simpson. First 
came an improbable scoop 
off the glass as the shot clock 
expired at the 2:35 mark. 
Then came a steal and fast-
break layup with 18 seconds 
left to reduce the deficit to 
one.

“(Simpson) 
gave 
us 
a 

spark halfway through the 
second half,” Wagner said. 
“Just contesting everything, 
stealing a lot, deflecting a 
lot of the balls. We were 
running the heck out of the 
ball, too.”

Simpson’s 
starting 

counterpart, 
Eli 
Brooks, 

had his own career-defining 
moment. The freshman hit 
two game-tying free throws 
with 10 seconds remaining to 
send the game to overtime.

“How about that?” John 

Beilein asked. “I don’t think, 
if you guys checked, that he’d 
made two in a row all year 
long. He always missed one 
of them. … For the freshman 
to be in that stage late in the 
game. That was huge for 
him to go in and knock them 
down. It shows a lot about 
Eli.”

In the extra period, it 

was all Michigan. Simpson’s 
career day — he had a career-
best 15 points — continued 
immediately with a three 
from the top of the key. 
Matthews followed suit, and 
UCLA could never make up 
for the offensive barrage.

The comeback was much-

needed for the Wolverines, 
who surrendered a 20-point 
lead to Ohio State in their 
previous game. The fact that 
they were even competitive 
in the contest, evidenced by 
a poor shooting display from 

the free throw line, seemed 
improbable.

“I’ve never seen anything 

like 
this,” 
Beilein 
said. 

“When you go 8-for-22 from 
the foul line and you win 
a game, it’s really a great 
testimony to our kids that we 
did everything that we could 
to play inefficient basketball, 
but when we really needed 
to suck it up and get work 
done at the end, we got it 
done. I’m hoping it’s a huge 
benchmark for our team as 
we go forward.”

Michigan 
should 

consider itself lucky to have 
been down by just three 
points at halftime, given 
that the Wolverines were 
outrebounded by a lopsided 
26-10 margin — 41-30 for the 
game — and fared marginally 
better with their frontcourt 
defense. The line between a 
narrow deficit and a blowout 
was perimeter defense — 
Michigan allowed only one 
trey and forced 12 UCLA 
turnovers in the half, an effort 
spearheaded by Simpson. 

Meanwhile, Bruins center 

Thomas Welsh had his way 
with Wagner down low, 
going 5-for-6 with eight 
boards in the first 20 minutes. 
Wagner almost responded in 
kind, with an 11-point, three-
rebound output of his own in 
the first half.

Like last year’s matchup 

between the two sides, the 
Wolverines took a nosedive 
to start the second half. They 
had as many turnovers in five 
minutes as they did in the 
first half, and they continued 
to have difficulty containing 
Welsh.

But 
in 
a 
two-minute 

stretch, 
Matthews 
had 

had enough. The redshirt 
sophomore 
went 
on 
a 

personal 8-0 run to cut 
into UCLA’s lead. Just as 
Michigan 
seemed 
to 
be 

turning a corner, an off-
balance, shot clock-beating 
3-pointer from Bruins guard 
Aaron Holiday halted its 
momentum.

“I felt like I lost these past 

two games for us because I 
wasn’t really bringing a lot 
of energy,” Matthews said. “I 

can’t let my teammates down 
again. This team looks at me 
a lot to step up when we’re 
down and I need to do what I 
need to do.”

The Wolverines, of course, 

didn’t take long to regain 
that 
momentum. 
Their 

electrifying late-game run 
catapulted them to a win they 
badly needed, and offered 
a glimpse of what this team 
could look like come March.

Two 
non-conference 

losses and a tough upcoming 
date at Texas is about what 
Michigan’s 
tournament 

résumé expected to look like 
at this point. But a 15-point 
comeback victory over UCLA 
surely sweetens the deal for a 
team battling inconsistency.

“The 
journey 
of 
this 

team,” Beilein said shaking 
his head, “and of you all 
that happen to be fans (who) 
are trying to figure out 
what Michigan is going to 
show up: get used to it. Our 
personality, our identity is 
not there yet.

“… Just hang on, I’m 

trying to hang on.”

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN

A Saturday for Shea

T

he sign was on full 
display, hoisted by 
members of the Maize 

Rage from the first row of 
section 130.

Written 

across poster 
board in big 
script letters 
were the 
words “Ole 
Mich.”

Below 

the script, 
though, there 
was a second 
message 
that required no interpretation: 
#WeWantSHEA.

And so began the official 

courting of Shea Patterson.

***
Patterson is the former 

No. 1 quarterback recruit in 
the 2016 recruiting class. He, 
along with safety Deontay 
Anderson and wide receiver 
Van Jefferson, took a visit to 
Ann Arbor this weekend — part 
of a unconventionally integral 
recruiting effort that came in 
the wake of NCAA sanctions 
handed down to Ole Miss.

All three were in attendance 

for the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s matchup with 
UCLA on Saturday.

The day, as it turns out, was 

void of many tangible recruiting 
efforts directed toward 
Patterson. And though the 
message was innocuous enough, 
even the sign was quickly 
confiscated.

LSA freshman Andy Rubin 

took credit for the inception of 
the sign but shared it with Dylan 
Wittenberg and Josh Goldstein 
— freshmen in the College of 
Engineering and School of 
Kinesiology, respectively.

Rubin said they were told 

the sign must be removed due 
to NCAA compliance rules that 
stated they were prohibited 
from actively recruiting 

Patterson. Writing his name on 
a sign fell under that category. 
Chanting his name did not.

And so they chanted — the 

same message they paired with 
a hashtag. It didn’t gain much 
traction, but according to Rubin, 
Patterson noticed — raising his 
hand in acknowledgment from 
a row over. The players noticed 
the sign, too, laughing at it and 
taking pictures.

To the trio of students, the 

rationale behind their antics 
was simple.

“If the best player is 

available,” Goldstein said, “then 
you wanna go get him if you 
can.”

Added Rubin: “Obviously if 

you look at at least three or four 
of the games this year, it came 
down to quarterback play,” 

Rubin said. “And he’s obviously 
what we need. And next year, 
we’re gonna have all of our 
best players — they’re gonna be 
juniors.

“It’s gonna be a time to push 

for a national championship, and 
obviously Peters and McCaffrey 
are great, but just to have one 
year with a stud quarterback 
with Rashan Gary and Devin 
Bush in their junior year, it’ll 
be crazy. We’ll open the season 
top three, we’ll be national title 
contenders.”

And so begins the mania.
Neither Goldstein nor Rubin 

is wrong. The Wolverines should 
want to pursue Patterson, and 
it looks like they are doing just 
that. Michigan would likely have 
finished above 8-4 with better 
quarterback play.

But suddenly, Patterson is 

already the Messiah in Ann 
Arbor. He has yet to officially 
commit to the Wolverines. Many 
likely don’t know him beyond 
his Ole Miss stat line. And yet 
he is tied to hopes of a national 
title.

For what it’s worth, 

Patterson is undoubtedly a 
special talent. Falling in love 
with his stat line — 3,139 yards 
with 23 touchdowns and 12 
interceptions through 10 games 
— is easy.

Still, the future — both 

Patterson’s and Michigan’s — 
isn’t certain. Ask Cesar Ruiz, 
who hosted all three Ole Miss 
players this weekend and played 
with Patterson at IMG Academy, 
if a new quarterback is coming 
to Ann Arbor, and he’ll grin as 

he delivers the answer.

“I know as much as y’all do.”
Ask Ruiz if his old teammate 

would fit well with the 
Wolverines.

“I think he’d be a good fit in 

anybody’s program. He’s a good 
quarterback.”

Ask Ruiz what Patterson’s 

best attribute is.

“He a little funny, goofy 

dude.”

But until that “little funny, 

goofy dude” officially pens his 
name to paper, Maurice Hurst 
may have a more measured take 
at what a transfer like Patterson 
could bring to Ann Arbor.

“I think it’s always a good 

thing to have competition,” the 
fifth-year senior defensive tackle 
said Thursday. “I know I’ve 
always been one to believe that 

competition brings out the best 
in everyone. I think that’s kind 
of where Coach Harbaugh is 
probably going with this.

“He’s probably thinking that, 

you know, ‘I can bring in some 
great players from Ole Miss, 
kind of guys that have already 
proven themselves.’ They’ll 
just be a great addition to the 
team, just adding another great 
dimension to a team that’s 
already pretty good.”

Maybe that’s the perfect 

evaluation then. Michigan is 
pretty good. Bring Patterson, 
and for one of two reasons, the 
Wolverines have potential to be 
great.

If the Ole Miss transfer is as 

good as advertised, Michigan 
has itself a hell of a quarterback 
in 2018. If Brandon Peters 
or Dylan McCaffrey beats 
Patterson out, then Michigan 
still has itself a hell of a 
quarterback in 2018.

That, though, is all in the 

future, and entirely dependent 
on Patterson’s decision to come 
to Ann Arbor in the first place.

So let’s stay in the present for 

a moment.

This weekend, Shea got a taste 

of the adoration people already 
feel for him and — whether he 
realizes it or not — a taste of 
their expectations as well.

He got a taste of Michigan 

Stadium, going onto the field 
before the basketball game to 
throw a few snowballs around.

And he got a taste of the 

atmosphere, with the crowd 
at Crisler Center chanting as 
loud as it has all year while the 
Wolverines recovered from a 
15-point deficit, forced overtime 
and ultimately topped UCLA.

All in all, Shea had himself a 

Saturday. Maybe he’ll have a few 
more of them here, too.

ICE HOCKEY
Turnovers an issue for 
‘M’ in weekend split

Something changed when the 

Michigan hockey team walked 
off the bus in East Lansing on 
Friday. 

The Wolverines (3-5-2 Big 

Ten, 7-7-2 overall) seemingly 
imploded in a 5-0 loss, which 
followed a commanding 4-0 win 
just the night before.

“I 
think, 
after 
the 
win 

yesterday, we got a little too 
comfortable,” 
said 
senior 

defenseman 
Sam 
Piazza. 

“We had a bad 
start and it just 
got worse from 
there.”

Onlookers 

were 
left 

wondering 
what happened 
against 
the 

Spartans 
(2-7-

1, 8-9-1). A high-octane offense 
that saw senior forward Tony 
Calderone net a hat trick in the 
game Thursday apparently lost 
its spark, unable to get on the 
board Friday.

This 
time, 
the 
Michigan 

defensive 
front 
wasn’t 
the 

problem – as it has been in 
recent weeks – but rather, the 
transitionary game was.

The Wolverines turned the 

puck over in the neutral zone, 
in the attacking third of the ice 
and even behind their own net. 
This wasn’t the case the night 
before, as 29 shots and four goals 
showcased the Michigan offense 
as a seamless streamline from 
the back line to the front.

However, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

woes 
were 
solidified 
when 

forward 
Patrick 
Khodorenko 

scored the Spartans’ second goal 
with just 4.9 seconds remaining 
in the first period to give them a 
two-goal lead.

Throughout 
the 
game, 

Khodorenko 
and 
forward 

Mitch Lewandowski – who 
tallied Michigan State’s third 

goal Friday – were giving the 
Michigan defense a substantial 
amount of grief.

Alongside 
forward 
Taro 

Hirose – who added to the 
Spartans’ 
behemoth 
of 
an 

offensive 
performance 
with 

three assists – the duo wreaked 
havoc in all facets of the game. 
What was shocking, though, was 
their silence the night before.

When the Wolverines were 

in East Lansing, they somehow 
could not hold onto the puck 

long enough to 
generate scoring 
opportunities. 
The 
aforementioned 
turnovers in all 
portions of the 
ice significantly 
stymied 
the 

Michigan 
offense.

“They checked 

us a little bit 
tighter,” 
said 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“We didn’t take care of the puck 
as well as we needed to.”

And as a result, Michigan 

State’s odd-man rush was able to 
make the Michigan defense look 
like Swiss cheese.

“We 
had 
more 
odd-man 

rushes tonight than we might 
have had over the last month,” 
Pearson said. “A lot of the cause 
was turnovers. We just didn’t 
take care of the puck.”

Back-passes from the slot to 

the blue line sailed back into 
the neutral zone, dumps were 
not contested by the right and 
left wings and the Spartans’ 
forwards 
out-bodied 
the 

Wolverines’ 
defensemen 
for 

pucks near the net.

So, the question remains, how 

can a team play the same team 
with such ease one night, and 
have a total shutdown the next?

Turning over the puck on 

most possessions didn’t help, 
and the Wolverines will have to 
use yet another break period – 
returning to play Jan. 1 – to iron 
out the kinks.

Michigan wrestling coach Joe McFarland is pleased with how the Wolverines have bounced back after a sluggish start to their season.

Michigan flexes muscle in win over Oregon State

As he stepped onto the mat, 

fifth-year senior Kevin Beazley 
knew he had the most daunting 
challenge of the day.

The 
197-pounder 
was 

the only Wolverine facing a 
nationally 
ranked 
wrestler 

during 
Michigan’s 
matchup 

against Oregon State. Tensions 
rose throughout Cliff Keen 
Arena as the wrestlers squared 
off, but all doubt was quickly 
erased as Beazley pinned the 
11th-ranked Corey Griego in 
the middle of the first period.

The match started off poorly 

for Beazley, who was taken 
down by Griego early in the 
round. Beazley responded in 
kind by quickly escaping and 
then taking down Griego before 
grinding out a hard-earned 
fall. Beazley inevitably won 
with a left-handed headlock.

“That was a great moment,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Joe 

McFarland. “He had to dig 
his heels in and really drive 
through that — but he stayed 
tough and kept driving and 
driving through it and was 
able to get him on his back and 

secure the pin.”

This 
match 
was 
largely 

indicative of the meet as a 
whole, as every wrestler found 
his hand raised by the referee at 
the end of his match. Michigan 
looked dominant from start 
to finish as the Wolverines 
shut 
out 
the 

Beavers, 48-0. 
In 
total, 
the 

meet contained 
two falls and 
three technical 
falls, 
a 
feat 

which 
helped 

the Wolverines 
(2-1) 
earn 
a 

statement 
win 
for 
the 

program.

Michigan had suffered a 

sluggish start to its season 
after squeaking by 11th-ranked 
Arizona State, 21-18, and losing 
big to 10th-ranked Lehigh, 
8-27. However, the Wolverines 
are showing signs of a massive 
momentum 
shift 
after 
an 

impressive showing at the Cliff 
Keen Las Vegas Invitational 
and a shutout win against 
Oregon State (2-1).

“Against 
Lehigh, 
we 

got punched in the face,” 

McFarland 
said. 
“We 
got 

beat on basic fundamentals 
out there, we got beat on mat 
wrestling, and so we’ve been 
working a lot on those areas — 
and we saw a lot of that today.”

The numbers corroborate 

McFarland’s 
claim, 
as 
no 

Wolverine 
wrestler trailed 
at the end of 
any 
period 

throughout 
the 

meet.

Another 

bright 
spot 
in 

Michigan’s 
performance 
can 
be 
found 

in 
freshman 

157-pounder 

Reece 
Hughes. 
Hughes’ 

redshirt was pulled as he 
subbed in for the injured 
redshirt 
sophomore, 

165-pounder 
Logan 
Massa. 

Not only did Hughes win his 
collegiate debut, 5-0, but he did 
it while wrestling up a weight 
class.

“I’m real proud of him,” 

McFarland said. “It’s tough — 
you go out there for the first 
time, in a Michigan singlet, in 
front of the nice crowd, but he 

stayed totally focused, was on 
task and did a great job.”

From here, the Wolverines 

have 
a 
break 
until 
they 

begin Big Ten play on Jan. 5. 
McFarland wishes to continue 
along 
this 
positive 
track 

through the break and further 
refine his wrestlers’ abilities.

“This break is going to 

be awesome,” Beazley said. 
“We get to break down some 
technique and keep getting 
better. Focusing on getting 
better mentally, getting better 
physically and just improving 
every time we step on the mat.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
shift 

in momentum may also be 
attributable to the friendly 
rivalry that exists within the 
Michigan squad. The wrestlers 
frequently compete with each 
other to see who will earn the 
most points in a given meet or 
even score the most falls in a 
season.

“I think the biggest thing 

is feeding off of each other,” 
Beazley said. “We had a little 
bit of trash talk going in the 
group chat — and we just feed 
off each other, so we’re just 
pushing each other and having 
fun when we’re out there.”

Simpson helps lead Michigan to unexpected comeback over UCLA

S

omewhere amid the hazy, 
ever-changing point guard 

battle lies 
an answer.

Only 

twice 
in John 
Beilein’s 
tenure at 
Michigan 
has the 
starting 
point guard 
played 
fewer than 32 minutes per game. 
This season, Zavier Simpson has 
slightly edged out Eli Brooks for 
the lead in point guard minutes. 
Neither eclipses 20 minutes per 
game.

At some point in the season — 

likely soon, if not now — Beilein 
will no longer subsist with a 
three-way revolving door at his 
most coveted position. If the entire 
precedent of Beilein’s offensive 
philosophy means anything, one 
point guard will become the guy.

What if that guy could be a 

former four-star, top-50 recruit? 
What if, in theory, that said recruit 
merely needed time to develop 
his offensive skill, to find his 
niche within a highly complicated 
offensive system and time to adjust 
to the speed and nuance of college 
basketball?

This is where Zavier Simpson 

was supposed to be in his second 
year on campus. This team was 
supposed to be his.

Yet in many ways, Simpson 

is still the forgotten man of this 
point guard battle. He doesn’t 
have the collegiate all-conference 
background of Jaaron Simmons, 
and he’s not the new freshman 
garnering regular praise for 
the ability to adjust to college 
basketball like Eli Brooks. Last 
season, Simpson averaged just 
1.6 points per game, and shot 
just 37 percent from the field, a 
particularly troublesome number 
given his propensity to shoot closer 
to the basket. Along for the ride 

of Derrick Walton Jr.’s magical 
journey last year, Simpson was a 
mere afterthought.

He wasn’t forgotten on 

Saturday, though. Star UCLA 
guard Aaron Holiday certainly 
won’t forget him.

Simpson entered the game 

with just over four minutes left 
as Holiday continued to terrorize 
Michigan’s guards. Holiday had 
23 points at the time and seemed 
to have an answer for every punch 
the Wolverines tried to throw in 
their comeback bid. Simpson’s 
thought process was quite simple.

“To go in and play defense. To 

try not to let him score, to try and 
just shut him out.”

Spurred by his trademark 

energy and tenacity, he did just 
that. He held Holiday scoreless 
for the remainder of regulation, 
including a steal off a lazy Holiday 
pass with 18 seconds left and a strip 
as Holiday tried to elevate from the 
free throw line in a tied game on 
the last possession.

Then Simpson opened up 

overtime by nailing a 3-pointer and 
capped it with a contested layup. 
He scored a career-high 15 points 
and cemented his claim to do away 
with the ongoing point guard roller 
coaster. 

“They’re both really good kids,” 

Beilein said. “We haven’t had 
fussing by all three of them. We 
made a decision going in we were 
going to play two of them… based 
on practice and games it’ll be two 
different ones. But we felt that they 
weren’t getting, nobody was really 
getting to feel what they needed 
to feel in a game. So we went with 
those two today, it could change at 
any time.”

But it doesn’t have to change at 

any time. A meritocratic decision 
only lasts until someone cements 
his merit. With a renewed, more 
complete skill set, Simpson might 
be ready for that.

“I’m not surprised,” said 

redshirt sophomore guard Charles 
Matthews, when asked about 
Simpson’s performance. “All he 

needed was his opportunity to get 
out there and get his rhythm, get 
his flow. I see how hard he works, 
night in and night out, and I know 
what type of dog he has in him, so I 
wasn’t surprised. I was just happy 
that he finally unleashed it.”

Defensive prowess has never 

been in doubt for Simpson. And 
there are signs that Simpson’s 
offensive growth — however 
incremental it may be — is real. 

In an admittedly small sample 

size, Zavier Simpson has improved 
his three-point percentage 
from 26 percent a year ago to 47 
percent this season. His field goal 
percentage has seen a similar jump, 
from 37 to 56. And in his two most 
recent performances, in which 
he was afforded his “rhythm” as 
Matthews described by playing 
20-plus minutes in each, Simpson 
has combined 10-for-14 for 26 
points, including a game-altering 
four-steal performance Saturday.

Zavier Simpson has the 

pedigree. Now his game might be 
rounding into form. 

What if the answer to the 

season’s preeminent question is 
just that simple?

With 4:23 left in the game, 

Zavier Simpson checked into a 
three-point game.

At that point, he had five points, 

three steals and a rebound to 
his credit. Bruins guard Aaron 
Holiday, meanwhile, had 23 points 
and had scored the last six to 
maintain his team’s lead.

So Michigan coach John Beilein 

turned to the sophomore guard. 
Simpson 
recalled 
his 
coach’s 

instructions.

“Play defense. Keep playing 

defense.”

He did that and more.
With just over 2:30 remaining, 

Michigan still trailed by four. The 
shot clock was running down on 
the Wolverines’ possession, and 
Simpson had the ball on the left 
wing. Senior guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur-Rahkman was running 
off a double screen, but he was 
covered tightly.

Simpson faked a pass, euro-

stepped into the lane and threw 
up a near-hook shot with his right 
hand. It bounced off the glass and 

in.

“I didn’t think it was going to 

be glass, but I knew it was going 
in once I released; it felt good,” 
Simpson said.

Michigan’s work was far from 

over, though. With 43 seconds left, 
UCLA had the ball with a three-
point lead. The Wolverines needed 
a stop. Simpson provided. He stole 
the ball from Holiday and took it 
coast-to-coast for the layup.

One-point game.
“It’s just unbelievable the way 

he impacts the game with his 
hands, how solid he was on Aaron 
Holiday,” said junior forward 
Moritz Wagner. “Aaron Holiday 
is a heck of a player, by the way. 
(Zavier) didn’t make dumb fouls 
like Muhammad and I did, so he 
stayed with it and led us.”

But then Beilein pulled Simpson 

out of the game. He replaced him 
with freshman Eli Brooks, who’s 
more 
of 
an 
offensive-minded 

guard.

Brooks didn’t disappoint either. 

After Bruins forward Gyorgy 
Goloman hit one of two free 
throws, Brooks ended up with the 
ball on the right wing. He drove 

to the basket and drew a foul. 
However, that wasn’t exactly a 
comforting occurrence for the 
Wolverines.

Michigan had been abysmal 

from the charity stripe up to that 
point in the game, shooting just 
over 31 percent. Add to that Brooks’ 
inexperience – he’d only attempted 
10 free throws in his career – and 
the uneasiness grew.

But Brooks calmly stepped to 

the line, hit both free throws and 
sent the game to overtime.

“How about that?” Beilein said. 

“… For a freshman to be in that 
stage late in the game, that was 
huge for him to just go in and knock 
them down.”

Simpson came back in to start 

the overtime period, and on the 
first possession, he drilled an open 
three from the top of the key. He 
added a layup and a free throw to 
finish the day with 15 points and 
four steals, and the Wolverines 
polished off a 78-69 victory.

“The point guard sets the tone 

on the offensive and defensive end,” 
Simpson said. “So I just wanted to 
come in and set the tone. I knew it 
would be contagious, and I knew it 
would rub off on my teammates.”

After the game, Brooks and 

Simpson led the Wolverines in 
singing “The Victors.” It’s a far cry 
from where they’ve been in the 
past few games.

Simpson entered the game 

averaging 3.4 points per game. 
Brooks was averaging 4.1. Though 
both had shown flashes, neither 
had established themselves as 
a 
consistent 
contributor. 
And 

on a team that didn’t seem to 
have an answer for when good 
opponents went on runs, Brooks’ 
and Simpson’s shortcomings were 
easier to see.

In that sense, Saturday felt 

familiar. UCLA went out to a 
15-point 
lead, 
and 
Michigan 

needed somebody to step up. 
Thanks to Simpson’s defense and 
timely shooting and Brooks’ free 
throws, though, the Wolverines’ 
response was rather unfamiliar.

Anthony 
McCallum 
was, 

literally and figuratively, the high 
point of Saturday’s intrasquad meet 
for the Michigan men’s gymnastics 
team. 

Though his Blue team ultimately 

fell to the Maize team, it took the 
junior all of 30 seconds to post 
the top score of the day with his 
Tsukahara double pike vault.

His vault, which consists of a 

round-off onto the springboard, a 
half-turn onto the table and two 
backflips in the pike position, is 
one of the most difficult routines 
currently being done. As the 
defending NCAA Vault champion, 
McCallum’s 
primary 
challenge 

will be maintaining an upward 
trajectory this year.

“He’s in championship form 

right now,” said Michigan coach 
Kurt Golder. “We just hope that 
nobody can catch up to him.”

Thanks to his powerful tumbling 

and the routine’s high level of 
difficulty, McCallum also won the 
individual all-around with a score 
of 80.85.

But unlike the vault, McCallum’s 

all-around 
victory 
wasn’t 
a 

foregone conclusion. Freshman 
Cameron Bock gave him a run for 
his money leading up until the final 
rotation. Then, a fall on his parallel 
bars dismount dropped him into 

second.

Bock’s performance, including 

a first-place finish on the still rings 
and second place on the pommel 
horse, high bar and the all-around, 
sent a message to the team’s 
veterans: don’t get too comfortable.

“I think what’s gonna help them 

is (the freshmen) putting heat on 
the upperclassmen,” Golder said. 
“They’re gonna take some lineup 
spots.”

But with his fall in the final 

rotation, Bock also demonstrated 
some of the same struggles that led 
the Wolverines to a disappointing 
seventh-place finish in last year’s 
Big Ten Championships.

“We’re gonna focus more on 

consistency,” Golder said. “If we can 
establish a little better consistency, 
it’ll take us a long way.”

Even more than the pommel 

horse — an event that has plagued 
Michigan in the past — Saturday’s 
meet revealed a need to focus on the 
parallel bars. Due to McCallum’s 
lofty 15.8 start value, he won the 
apparatus despite putting his knee 
down on his double pike dismount.

The news on parallel bars isn’t all 

bad, though. The team now knows 
what it must focus on in preparation 
for regular season meets.

“Make a few adjustments,” 

Golder said. “Sacrifice a little bit of 
difficulty so that we’re reducing the 
risk of missing a routine.”

Amid tentative performances 

from some of his teammates, junior 
Uche Eke provided the Maize team 
with 
much-needed 
steadiness. 

Though he competed only on the 
high bar, parallel bars and pommel 
horse, Eke contributed the top 
execution score on all three — 
good enough for top-three finishes 
despite low start values.

But Eke has more up his sleeve. 

He 
didn’t 
showcase 
the 
full 

difficulty of his routines due to a 
hand injury, but he’s been training a 
new release move that could make 
him an even bigger asset on high 
bar for the Wolverines.

“It’s a big-time skill, very 

exciting,” Golder said. “We’ll have 
that back in for sure.”

A 
recent 
surgery 
limited 

freshman Jacob Moore to just three 
events, but he too flashed immense 
potential. He placed first on floor 
with a 14.3 — the second-highest 
individual score of the meet — and 
third on the pommel horse with a 
13.65.

On the former, Moore made 

his case to be a worthy addition to 
the lineup on one of Michigan’s 
strongest events. On the latter, 
he provided some much-needed 
stability to a potential Achilles heel 
for the Wolverines.

At full strength, Moore’s form 

and execution make him a threat 
in the all-around, indicating that 
bigger things are to come for a 
young Michigan squad.

Michigan begins season with scrimmage

After 
a 
mediocre 

performance 
in 
the 
2017 

season, the Michigan men’s 
gymnastics team sought to 
bounce back by getting its 
squad loosened up and ready to 
head into competitive play with 
its annual scrimmage. 

Saturday, 
the 
Wolverines 

commenced play at Cliff Keen 
Arena, where the Maize team 
defeated the Blue team, 399.35 
to 388.35.

Junior Anthony McCallum, 

the defending NCAA Vault 
champion, picked up where he 
left off and led the scoring with 
14.9 points on the vault and 
80.85 points in the all-around 
for the Blue team. 

For 
the 
Maize 
team, 

freshman 
Cameron 
Bock 

showed promise, scoring 80.55 
in the all-around to make a 

push for a rotation spot.

Michigan coach Kurt Golder 

– who did not lead either the 
Maize or Blue team explicitly 
for this match – was impressed 
with McCallum, asserting his 
vault 
performance 
Saturday 

would have won again.

The 
Wolverines 
have 
an 

experienced 
squad 
as 
very 

few 
seniors 
graduated 
last 

year. They also picked up 
a 
considerable 
number 
of 

freshmen this past year, and 
Golder expects them to compete 
and occupy some of the spots in 
the rotation. 

“I think what will really 

help us is the freshmen that 
came in putting the heat on the 
upperclassmen,” Golder said.

Though some of the gymnasts 

had shaky performances on 
the pommel horse and rocky 
landings off the horizontal bar, 
Golder wasn’t concerned. He 
mentioned the biggest issue 

his team will have to work on 
going forward is to cut out 
the mistakes and focus on 
consistency. 

Golder 
also 
noted 
that 

he doesn’t expect the long 
holiday break to have much 
of an impact on the players’ 
form going into the season. 
Despite many players coming 
from far regions, he expects 
his gymnasts to be practicing 
in their hometowns regularly 
during the off period just as 
they did before they came to 
the team.

“When they go back home, 

they’re 
always 
welcome 
to 

go back to their home club 
gyms, and we’ll have voluntary 
practices over break for those 
who are staying along,” he 
mentioned.

With 
a 
solid 
mix 
of 

experience and fresh blood, it 
seems that they will start 2018 
on the right foot.

Michigan recovers from early deficit to defeat Golden Flashes

Kent State’s bench went wild 

as guard Alexa Golden nailed 
a buzzer-beater to end the first 
quarter. The Michigan women’s 
basketball team’s bench remained 
quiet.

By the end of the opening frame, 

Michigan’s leading scorer hadn’t 
made any baskets. Senior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty was 0-for-3 on 
3-point shots, and the Wolverines 
were down by 10.

That didn’t change much. The 

Wolverines’ outcome did. By the 
end of the day, Michigan recovered 
to notch a 54-41 victory over the 
Golden Flashes.

“I think that team did a great 

job of game planning and trying to 
limit Katelynn’s touches and make 
her work for everything else,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico. 
“Some other people had to step up 
and try to make plays.”

That’s exactly what junior center 

Hallie Thome eventually did.

She had an awkward landing 

coming down from a rebound and 
was helped off the court — all while 
the Wolverines held their breath 
awaiting her fate. Immediately 
after Thome was taken out, Kent 
State scored twice and began to 
take the lead.

They continued to score — 

while Michigan had no answer — 
throughout the duration of the first 
quarter and ended the frame ahead, 
15-5.

But Thome reentered the game 

for the second quarter and made 
the first shot and a free throw — 
keying Michigan on a run to close 
the 10-point deficit with a taped-up 
ankle.

“I think that she knows that she’s 

an essential part of our team,” said 
freshman forward Hailey Brown. 
“It’s part of her character to want to 
be on the court and playing.”

With an injured Thome bringing 

Michigan within striking distance, 
Flaherty finally scored her first 

basket of the game with four 
minutes left in the frame.

A pass from Thome gave junior 

guard Nicole Munger a wide open 
3-pointer to give the Wolverines 
the lead, 19-17. Munger’s shot 
brought out the energy that Crisler 
had been lacking throughout the 
first half, as the crowd erupted 
when Munger gave the Wolverines 
their advantage.

Munger attributed the comeback 

to their defense.

“What we were saying to each 

other during the breaks and on the 
court was, ‘Get stops because that’s 
the only thing we can control,’ ” 
Munger said. “Our best offense 
is when it comes to our defense. 
If we can get a steal and go in 
transition or a big rebound and go 
in transition, we know that’ll lead 
us to easy buckets.”

The Wolverines scored two 

unanswered baskets to open out 
the second half, the first by Thome. 
Brown led the charge for the 
Wolverines at that point, as she 
had eight points at the four-minute 
mark of the third quarter. She was 
followed by Munger, Thome and 
Robbins, each with five. At that 
point in the game, Flaherty had only 
scored four. But her contributions 
came nonetheless.

In the final seconds of the third 

quarter, Flaherty snuck a pass to 
Munger, who sunk a shot from 
beyond the arc and gave Michigan a 
10-point lead to close out the frame.

The fourth quarter started off 

slowly, with no points scored in 
the first two minutes. But Thome 
finally broke the stalemate, and 
the Wolverines finished the game 
comfortably — holding a lead by 
nine or more points for the rest of 
the game.

Midway through the first 

quarter, junior center Hallie 
Thome hit the ground hard 
after going up for a rebound. She 
immediately grasped her right 
leg while lying on the floor and 
needed help as she limped back 
to the bench, not putting any 
weight on her injured leg.

The No. 24 Michigan women’s 

basketball team (8-2) entered its 
season with a dream of making 
the NCAA Tournament, but on 
Sunday afternoon against Kent 
State, the Wolverines had to 
confront the possibility of that 
dream evaporating into thin air.

“Anytime any of our kids go 

down,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico, “you get a little 
nervous.”

Though she returned to the 

game for the second quarter 
after receiving assistance, her 
team felt her absence for the five 
minutes she was 
out. 
Michigan 

struggled 
without Thome, 
scoring just two 
points until late 
in the opening 
quarter. 
The 

Wolverines 
trailed 
15-5 

after 
the 
first 

10 minutes and 
seemed 
lost 

without their star center. 

But Thome’s injury turned out 

to be just a minor one, and after 
taping her ankle, she came back 
stronger. Throughout the second 
quarter, she played through the 
pain and had an active presence 

on the court, helping her team 
bounce back from the early 
deficit — the game was tied at 19 
at the half.

“She 
was 

critical, 
her 

getting back into 
the game for us,” 
Barnes 
Arico 

said. “She didn’t 
look 
like 
she 

was 
hobbling. 

Her 
face 
was 

wincing in pain, 
so I’m sure it was 
throbbing, 
but 

she didn’t look 

like she was hobbling.”

In the second half, Thome 

led Michigan to an eventual 
54-41 victory. She finished with 
11 points, tying for the team 
high, and grabbed six rebounds 
as well. While senior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty struggled and 
scored just four points, Thome 
stepped up to give the team the 
spark it needed.

She 
thrived 
when 
the 

Wolverines lacked steadiness, 
and she prevented what could 
have been an upset.

“It was incredible,” Barnes 

Arico said. “In the start of the 
second half, we went to her right 
away and she really made some 
plays for us to get us a little bit of 
a lead. … She’s been banged up a 
little bit — she hurt her wrist in 
practice the other day — but she 
was able to get back in the game 
and play through that which was 
really impressive.”

Thome’s toughness will help 

Michigan down the road since 
she is the team’s only true center. 
Her height and touch around 
the rim have been staples of the 
Wolverines’ success, and will be 
crucial as they work toward a 
postseason run.

So while there may have been 

some panic at Crisler Center, 
Michigan’s tournament dreams 
didn’t suffer a fatal blow, all 
thanks to Thome.

Wolverines get blown out, settle for series split against Michigan State

EAST LANSING — A home 

advantage, historic rivalry or 
explosive crowd are all factors 
that can turn the tables in a 
college hockey game on their 
own. And unfortunately for 
the Michigan hockey team, all 
three were present in a packed 
Munn Ice Arena on Friday 
night.

Following the Wolverines’ 

shutout 
of 
Michigan 
State 

on Thursday — their first 
of the season — they may 
have thought they had some 
breathing room heading into 
the second part of the home-
and-home series. Instead, they 
were left suffocating.

The Spartans’ offense came 

to life early in the game, giving 
them a lead that would only 
grow as the game wore on. 
Michigan (3-5-2-1 Big Ten, 7-7-2 
overall) ultimately suffered a 
sizable 5-0 loss to conference 
bottom-dweller Michigan State 
(2-7-1-1, 
8-9-1), 
forcing 
the 

Wolverines to head home with 
a series split.

“The tables were reversed 

tonight,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “They made their 
chances count, and we couldn’t 
score. I think it was just a tale 
of two games. Last night, we got 
the best of them, and tonight 
they were the better team.” 

Right out of the gates, the 

rival teams played a back-and-
forth game, with the puck 
continuously launching from 
one side of the ice to the other 
over the first eight minutes.

But almost halfway through 

the period, this pattern quickly 
came to a halt.

Michigan suffered the first 

penalty of the game, as senior 
forward 
Niko 
Porikos 
was 

sent to the box for boarding 
8:13 into the period. After the 
power-play faceoff, Michigan 
State capitalized on the man-
advantage, as forward Patrick 
Khodorenko slapped the puck 
into the net five seconds into 
the penalty.

This early goal demonstrated 

a clear shift from the previous 

night — a lopsided game in 
which the Spartans gave the 
Wolverines 
little 
to 
worry 

about. Additionally, it ensured 
that 
sophomore 
goaltender 

Hayden Lavigne, who was given 
the start for the second straight 
night, would not see another 
shutout between the pipes. 

Despite 
Michigan’s 

numerous attempts to equalize 
the score over the next few 
minutes 
— 
the 
Wolverines 

had double the on-target shot 
count of Michigan State until 
the final two minutes of the 
period — none of its shots broke 
through 
Spartan 
goaltender 

Jon Lethemon.

While 
it 
looked 
like 

Michigan would escape the 
first period with just a one-
goal deficit, Michigan State 
had other intentions. With just 
four seconds dwindling on the 
clock, Khoderenko challenged 
Lavigne yet again — this time 
with his team at full strength. 
His next attempt was successful, 
sending the Spartans into the 
first intermission with a two-
goal lead.

Just 2:06 into the second 

period, the Wolverines were 

given a chance to answer with 
a power play as Michigan State 
was called for slashing, but they 
failed to make use of their first 
man-advantage.

The Spartans showed they 

would 
not 
sit 
comfortably 

with 
a 
2-0 
lead, 
striking 

again 
midway 
through 
the 

second period. Nine minutes 
in, junior forward Brendan 
Warren was sent to the box for 
hooking, giving Michigan State 
another power play. Forward 
Mitch Lewandowski put the 
advantage to good use, tacking 
on the Spartans’ third goal of 
the game.

As Michigan’s offense lay 

fairly 
dormant, 
Michigan 

State continued to avenge its 
embarrassing loss from the 
previous night, showing no 
signs of stopping throughout 
the rest of the second period. 
With just under six minutes 
remaining, the Spartans fired 
again, and this time it would 
be defenseman Mitch Eliot who 
chipped in to the efforts. Eliot 
knocked in Michigan State’s 
fourth goal of the night, leaving 
the Wolverines desperate for 
a large rally heading into the 

final period of play.

Michigan sent sophomore 

goaltender 
Jack 
LaFontaine 

into the game to guard the 
net, 
but 
LaFontaine 
would 

soon face a similar fate as his 
counterpart.

The Spartans continued their 

offensive onslaught, recording 
seven shots on goal within 
the first four minutes of the 
third period. On their eighth 
shot — yet another power 
play — Michigan State struck 
gold, proving that it could test 
LaFontaine as well. Forward 
Logan 
Lambdin 
punched 

the puck past the netminder, 
leaving 
Michigan 
players 

scrambling to recover from a 
five-goal deficit.

“I think (the crowd) does 

give the home team a spark, 
there’s no question about it,” 
Pearson said. “But goals give 
your team a spark. And they 
got the goals at key times to 
get their team on the board. 
We had some good looks and 
good chances at key times, but 
we didn’t finish. And when you 
can’t finish, you’re not going to 
win many games.” 

Simply put, the Wolverines 

were never able to find the 
Spartan net.

Michigan left East Lansing 

empty-handed, with a shutout 
loss following a shutout win 
just the night before.

The Wolverines won’t have 

to wait long before confronting 
the Spartans again at the Great 
Lakes 
Invitational 
in 
early 

January. In many ways, Friday’s 

game served as a reality check 
for the next encounter. 

“Anytime you face State, it’s 

huge,” said senior defenseman 
Sam Piazza. “Yesterday we 
were incredibly fired up and 
ready to rock, and we played 
well and won by a lot. And we 
got too comfortable. So next 
time we cross their path, we 
won’t be so comfortable.”
