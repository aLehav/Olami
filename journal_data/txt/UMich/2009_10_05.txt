DONATION DIVIDENDS:
PART 1 OF A 5-PART SERIES
The big
impact of
an office
rarely seen

ZACHARY MEISNER/Daily
Members of the Michigan State football team hoist the Paul Bunyan Trophy after their overtime victory over Michigan on Saturday at Spartan Stadium in East Lansing.

"Sometimes, it defines you. It
defines your program. It defines who
you are," Michigan State coach Mark
Dantonio on the Michigan-Michigan
State rivalry."
EAST LANSING -
antonio didn't even
need to say it. The tens
of thousands of green-
and-white-clad fans inside
Spartan Stadium celebrating
back-to-back Michigan State
wins for the first time in 42 years
said it with the loudest rendition of
a school fight song I've ever heard.
If you're looking for the same
roaring, program-defining message
from Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez, keep looking. It's not going to
comefromtheWestVirginianative.
But for what Rodriguez is trying to

accomplish at Michigan, that's not
necessarily a bad thing.
"This one
hurts, and is
going to hurt,
and it's going to
hurt everybody
in our program
for 24 hours,"
Rodriguez said
following the
Wolverines' RUTH
26-20 over- LINCOLN
time loss to the
Spartans. "After
that, we've got to move on, and
we've got a big Saturday night game
next weekend."
I trulybelievethatevenas aWest
Virginia native, Rodriguez realizes
this in-state battle matters to fans.
Rodriguez has said he understands

Michigan-Michigan State is not
just another game. But his actions
say otherwise. Rodriguez is looking
at the national picture.
It's not like Saturday's game was
devoid of emotion. Quarterback
Tate Forcier led an unthinkable
comeback with less than five min-
utes to play in regulation, and the
game ended in a thrilling but frus-
trating finish. Rodriguez walked to
the podium for his postgame press
conference, fuming with anger and
answering questions curtly.
It was obvious this game was
different for Rodriguez, but only
because it was a loss - not neces-
sarily because it was a loss to Mich-
igan State.
In his attempts to create his own
Michigan winning legacy, Rodri-
guez will succeed in the areas he

knows best: national exposure and
national recruiting.
The national exposure Michi-
gan draws is right up Rodriguez's
alley. During his time at West Vir-
ginia, the Moutaineers never had
the major intra-state rival that fans
could rally around. With a small
state population, Rodriguez had to
recruit from the country-wide pool.
In doing so, he established national
recruiting ties that were attractive
to Michigan athletic director Bill
Martin.
In recent years, it's been hard
to-ignore the increase in in-state
players choosing the Spartans over
Michigan. But under Rodriguez,
the south and west are carrying
more weight.

The growing role
of the University's
Development Office
in campus affairs
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
and KYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporters
Exiled from campus, in atow-
ering 10-story building off State
Streetnear Eisenhower Parkway,
one the most vital offices to the
University's operations stands in
plain view, but hidden from the
eyes of campus.
The building's rigid design and
obscure location do little to sug-
gest the big impact the offices on
the building's upper floors have
on the day-to-day lives of nearly
every person on campus.
While many on campus are
unaware of its presence, the Uni-
versity's Office of Development
plays a key role in funding opera-
tions on campus - a business
whose reach spans from North
Campus to the Big House and
from the country's East Coast to
the Pacific Ocean.
Each year the office helpsraise
hundreds of millions of dollars
that go toward a wide range of
activities and services, including
student financial aid, endowing
professorships and funding new

campus construction projects.
With such a vast array of ser-
vices funded either fully or par-
tially through private support,
the Office of Development is
essential to the University's abil-
ity to function.
In a series of interviews over
the last two months, officers
from the University's develop-
ment office have stressed the
importance of gifts, both large
and small, that make it possible
for the University to operate at
what they consider to be its full
potential.
Even in the midst of an eco-
nomic crisis, private support has
remained strong as gifts from
alumni and non-affiliated donors
help maintain the University's
stature and grow it for future
generations.
Whether in the form of major
gifts from wealthy alumni, a $50
check in response to a phone call,
a house left by a deceased faculty
member or a gift from a graduate
living halfway around the world,
individuals comprise the largest
group of donors to the Univer-
sity.
The Development Office's
diversified fundraisingstrategies
span from the smallest individu-
al gifts to a multi-million dollar
donation from gigantic corpo-
rations to help fund innovative
scientific research projects that

Chair of College
Republicans faces
impeachment

Chair claims
differing political
views to blame
By ELYANA TWIGGS
Daily StaffReporter
The chair of the University's
chapter of the College Republi-
cans may face impeachment at
the club's meeting tonight.
Chair Gordon Chaffin
informed The Michigan Daily of
his forthcoming impeachment,
blaming his moderate beliefs
as the driving force behind the
push, in particular his support
of President Barack Obama's
attempts to reform the American
health care system. But follow-
ing calls to all 13 members of the
group's executive board, none of
the nine members reached would
confirm or deny the reason for
the censure motion.
Among those saying they had
no comment was Brady Smith,
adviser to the Board of Col-

lege Republicans and a previous
chair of the group. Smith said
that other members of the group
would not comment either.
"There should be a gag order
put in place," Smith said yester-
day. "It is internal right now, and
we aren't ready to comment on
what hasn't happened yet. Before
tomorrow, it is too early to specu-
late."
The censure action is expect-
ed to be brought up at the group's
meeting tonight at 9 p.m. in the
Tappan Room of the Michigan
Union.
In an interview yesterday,
Chaffin, an LSA senior, claimed
group members have been
searching for a reasonto oust him
because his ideology strays from
that of some of his fellow group
members. Along with being a
supporter of Obama's health
care plan, Chaffin described
himself as "pro-choice, opposed
to the death penalty, in favor of
same-sex marriage and willing
to accept reasonable gun control

Suspicious package shuts down parts of GWU

A suspicious looking "brown

Washington University's Fulbright
Residence Hall prompted police
to shut down Washington D.C.'s
23rd Street for two hours on Tues-
day afternoon, according to the
school's student newspaper, The
GW Hatchet.
Two university buildings were
evacuated and several other loca-
tions around thescene were blocked
off, including the Foggy Bottom
Metro Station. Access to Washing-
ton Circle was also prevented.
University spokeswoman
Michelle Sherrard told The Hatch-

campus buildings in the area to
keep people away while they inves-
tigated.

STUDENT'S SERVICE DOG

Millikin University in Illinois has
recently been confronted with a fed-
eral discrimination lawsuit after forc-
ing a legally blind, epileptic student
to move out of her dorm because she
acquired a service dog, according to
The Chronicle of Higher Education.
The lawsuit alleges that Catherine
Nielsen, a student at the university
during the 2005-2006 academic year,
was told having aguide dog would not
be an issue. However, when she got
the dog, Nielsen was forced to move to
another, less accessible dorm, accord-
ing to the Chronicle's article.
The suit claims that the move
caused Nielsen discomfort, stress
and increased epileptic episodes.
If the university loses the lawsuit,
it would be forced to pay Nielsen's

STANFORD TO SELL $1 BILLION
OF ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS
In the face of a 25 percentdecrease

University islookingto sell about a bil-

The Wall Street Journal reported.
In the past decade, Stanford
has preferred to invest in illiquid
assets rather than private equities.
However, the failing economy has
diminished the value of these assets,
sucking up their liquidity and leav-
ing the university strapped for cash
needed to runschool operations.
Stanford is considering offers on
all $5 billion of its investments but
is only looking to sell about 10 to 20
percent of its holdings, according to
the Wall Street Journal article.

Activist wants Bing

An activist wants Detroit Mayor
Dave Bing's chief administrative
assistant removed from his posi-
tion due to a state law that bans
anyone who has been convicted
of bribery from accepting a politi-
cal appointment or holding public
office.
Agnes Hitchcock of the Call 'Em
Out Coalition says Charles Beck-
ham isn't eligible to serve due to a
1984 conviction for rigging a City
of Detroit sludge-hauling contract.
Federal investigators said Beckham
took $16,000 in bribes.
Hitchcock sent a letter asking
Michigan Attorney General Mike
Cox to remove Beckham from
Bing's cabinet. The Detroit Free

WASHINGTON
Adviser downplays
threat of renewed
al-Qaida haven
A top U.S. commander's public
plea for more troops in Afghanistan
prompted a mild rebuke yesterday
from the White House national
security adviser, as the adminis-
tration heads into a second week
of intensive negotiations over its
evolving Afghan strategy.
Retired Gen. James Jones said
that decisions on how best to stabi-
lize Afghanistan and beat back the
insurgency must extend beyond
troop levels to development and
governance. And the request by
Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal,
the top U.S. commander in Afghan-
istan, for up to 40,000 more troops
is just one of three key elements
advisers must consider as they meet
this week to plot the way ahead.
He added that it is "better for
military advice to come up through
the chain of command," rather
than off a public stage, referring
to McChrystal's speech in London
last week making a case for more
troops. But Jones also beat back
suggestions that the open campaign
could jeopardize the general's job.
McChrystal "is in it for the long
haul," Jones said. "I don't think this
is an issue."

Waves of new fund
cuts imperil U.S.
nursing homes
The nation's nursing homes are
perilously close to laying off work-
ers, cutting services - possibly
even closing - because of a perfect
storm wallop from the recession
and deep federal and state gov-
ernment spending cuts, industry
experts say.
A Medicare rate adjustment that
cuts an estimated $16 billion in
nursinghome funding over the next
10 years was enacted at week's end
by the federal Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services - on top of
state-level cuts or flat-funding that
already had the industry reeling.
And Congress is debating slash-

ingbillions more in Medicare fund-
ing as part of health care reform.
Add it all up, and the nursing
home industry is headed for a cri-
sis, industry officials say.
"We can foresee the possibility
f nursing homes having to close
* 4mir doors," said David Hebert, a
senior vice president at the Ameri-
con Health Care Association. "I
certainly foresee that we'll have to
.lt staff go."

In lecture, Krugman
talks trade, downturn

White House
sees progress
in Iran talks

New York Times
columnist spoke on
campus Friday
By OLIVIA CARRINO
For the Daily
Nobel Prize-winning econo-
mist Paul Krugman offered cau-
tious optimism - or silver-lined
pessimism, depending on your
point of view - to the crowd that
filled Hill Auditorium from the
orchestra to the mezzanine Friday
afternoon.
"The apocalypse has been post-
poned, but it's been a pretty shock-
ing crisis and we are nowhere near
being out of the woods," he said.
Krugman, an op-ed colum-
nist for The New York Times and
professor of economics and inter-
national affairs at Princeton Uni-
versity, spoke as part of the 2009
Citigroup Foundation Lecture
series.
The lecture was in honor of
the career of Alan Deardorff, the
associate dean of the Ford School
of Public Policy and a professor of
international economics and pub-
lic policy.
Krugman primarily talked
about what led to the globalization
boom and the effects of interna-
tional trade on world economies,
as well as the current global eco-
nomic crisis.
"Today's world is extraordi-
narily complex with enormous
volumes of trade," he said, adding
that what makes today's global
economy different are "these com-
plex supply chains where things
are in many stages of production."
He credited the growth of glo-
balization and the emergence
of complex supply chains to
advancements in technology, the
utilization of "differences in com-
petence" and advantages of scale

in variousdeveloping economies.
These factors, he said, led to a
phenomenon he called "fragmen-
tation of production."
"Is it a good thing or is it a bad
thing? The answer, of course, is
yes," he said, causing laughter
from the audience.
Globalization is good, he said,
because it allows countries to spe-
cialize.
"We have countries concentrat-
ing on the things they do really,
really well," he said.
"We've got the whole world
producing more efficiently, which
means world wealth has gone up."
On the negative side, he said,
"There are many dislocations and
many distributional effects."
"The most obvious - and one
that we worry about a lot - is that
lower formal education workers
in advanced countries are almost
certainly hurt by the inequality,"
he said. "It is wider to some extent
because of globalization."
"If you take a global citizen
view," he said, "those losses are
less dramatic than the huge
gains."
Krugman said globalization
exacerbated the effects of the
global recession because world
leaders were limited in their
capacity to respond to it with
coordinated policies.
"We createdthisglobaleconomy
without creating the institutions
we need to manage it," he said.
"We are to a certain extent hold-
ing the world economy together by
Scotch Tape and chewing gum."
"As a citizen of the world I am
quite horrified about what we are
going through," he continued.
"Little less frightening than it was
six months ago, but I'm still in awe
of the prospects."
He added: "It's a great time to
study, unfortunately nyt to live
through."1
After the lecture, audience

members had mixed reactions.
First-year MBA student Steuart
Botchford said he found the lec-
ture to be thought-provoking.
"I thought it was really inter-
esting to hear sort of a perspective
on the world that takes globaliza-
tion not necessarily as the be-all
to end-all for saving the world,"
Botchford said. "He really has a
very nuanced perspective of the
way the world works and how
some things which always seem
good may end up not being so good
and some things which seem bad
may actually end up being good."
LSA senior Jacob Mirowitz was
less impressed.
"To be honest, I was a little dis-
appointed just because I read his
articles every once in a while and
he provides a pretty good over-
view of what's going on in the
economy and what the problems
are with the current economic cri-
sis," he said. "Today, focusing on
just international trade was alittle
bit boring and it was a little like
sitting in an econ lecture that you
really don't want tobe in."
Dieter Burrell, summer pro-
gram assistant director for the
Inter-University Consortium
for Political and Social Research
at the University, agreed with
Mirowitz.
"He seemed more nervous and
I thought it would be more about
contemporary issues," he said.
Scott Kassner, assistant direc-
tor for the LSA Honors Program,
praised Krugman.
"I think Paul Krugman is bril-
liant and is particularly adept at
taking very complex ideas and
expressing them in a way that the
general listener, the general read-
er can understand," Kassner said.
"He is by no means an optimist,
but at least you leave listening to
him having a sense that there are
very smart people who are think-
ing about these issues."

Inspectors to visit
Iran's uranium
enrichment site
on Oct. 25
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
White House said yesterday it sees
signs of progress in confronting
Iran's nuclear program while mem-
bers of Congress endorsed authoriz-
ing tougher U.S. economic penalties
against the Tehran government.
International inspectors are to
visit Iran's newly disclosed uranium
enrichment site on Oct. 25. That
announcement yesterday capped a
furious week of diplomacy, includ-
ing Thursday's session in Geneva
where Iran and six world powers
resumed nuclear talks.
"The fact that Iran came to the
table and seemingly showed some
degree of cooperation, I think, is
a good thing," said James Jones,.
President Barack Obama's national
security adviser.
"But this is not going to be an
open-ended process. We want to
be satisfied. We, the world commu-
nity, want to be satisfied within a
short period of time," Jones added.
"So it's not going to be extended
discussions that we're going to have
before we draw our conclusions to
what their real intent is. But for
now, I think things are moving in
the right direction."
Suspicions about Iran's nuclear
intentions have risen steadily along
with fears - and some evidence
- that Tehran wants to build an
atomic bomb and is using what it
calls is a civilian nuclear energy
program as cover. The Iranians are
under three sets of U.N. penalties
for refusing to stop enriching ura-
nium, a key first step toward build-
ing a bomb.
"Our whole approach is predi-
cated on an urgent need to pre-

vent Iran from obtaining a nuclear
weapons capacity," said Susan
Rice, U.S. ambassador to the Unit-
ed Nations.
"Right now we are in a period of
intense negotiations. It's not an infi-
nite period. It's avery finite period,"
she said.
Rice said that in the best outcome,
Iran would not have any nuclear
weapons, no longer pose a threat to
its neighbors or support terrorism,
and treat its people with respect,
allowing them to participate peace-
fully in a democratic process. "That's
the Iranwe hope to see."
Current penalties have failed to
change Tehran's course and have
been watered down through efforts
by Russia and China. Those coun-
tries, along with the U.S., Britain
and France, can block action in the
Security Council.
Rice said the U.S. had three
options: to push sanctions through
the U.N.; work with European allies
to punish Iran; or to take unilateral
action in conjunction with the other
possible courses of action.
Members of Congress are ready
to authorize steps the U.S. can take
against Iran, in addition to possible
U.N. action.
Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said the
U.S. "cannot allow talking and nego-
tiation to replace strong action if we
feel we have to take that step."
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,
said he would like Congress to pass
measures that would "empower
the president and our country to
be tough and to put some actions
behind words. So let's have 'Iran
Week' in the Senate and get some-
thing done."
Lawmakers are talking about
trying to block gas and refined
petroleum exports to Iran, pos-
sibly causing serious disruptions
in the lives of ordinary Iranians.
Others moves could affect Iran's
financial institutions and impose
new trade bans.


MEDICAL SCHOOL
From Page 1A
having more faculty and encourag-
ing more research in the humani-
tarian aspects of medicine, it does
feel a little frustrating at times to
see a lack of opportunity in those
avenues."
"Granted, medical school is not
really focused on policy," he said.
"But I think that given the topical
nature of health reform, I think that
I am not more prepared to talk on
health reform than anyone else and
I am going to be dedicating my life
to medicine."
Owen Darr, a second-year Medi-
cal School student, said he feelsthat
becomingwellversed inhealthcare
policy is a key step on the way to
becoming a good doctor.
"It's something that patients are
concerned with, and hospitals are
concerned with," Darr said. "That
puts us right in the middle."
Darr said he plans on takingelec-
tive courses on health care policy in
the coming semester.
Faculty members at the School of
Public Health, which offers classes
on health care policy, have taken
notice of the lack of opportunities
for medical students to explore
more social dimensions of medi-
cine.

"If you want to treat patients you
might want to know about what
kind of health insurance they have,"
said Richard Lichtenstein, associ-
ate professor of the Department of
Health Management and Policy in
the School of Public Health.
Lichtenstein, who teaches a
course on the U.S. health care sys-
tem, has-found that the traditional
medical school curriculum that
focuses mainly on clinical matters
leads many practicing doctors to
return for additional schooling.
"The last class we had 34 people
and 26 were physicians," said Lich-
tenstein. "People start to develop
this knowledge that they don't
know enough and want to learn
more."
Connections between the Medi-
cal School and the School of Public
Health, which offers courses on
health care policy, have been set
up to provide opportunities for stu-
dents to gain practical knowledge of
how the health care system works,
according to Dr. Paula Lantz, chair
of the Department of Health Man-
agement and Policy at the School of
Public Health.
"There are many opportunities
for medical students, residents and
fellows to get a degree in public
health," Lantz said. "For example,
we have a joint program with the
Medical School through which

someone can get their M.D. and
M.P.H. in five years.
"Given what is required to train
people to be good physicians, there
is not much time left for education
regarding the health care delivery
system, population health issues,
and health policy," Lantz said.
Goel said that medical school
students may benefit from a greater
focus on the doctor-patient rela-
tionship in the school's curriculum.
"There is a significant amount of
material that we have to cover and a
lot of the time I don't feel we spend
enough time on clinical medicine,"
Goel said.
Time constraints aside, many
professors, as well as doctors, still
feel that knowledge of how health
care works is an essential part of
becoming a good doctor.
"Our patients depend on us to
help them navigate the U.S. health
care' system, which can be very
hard to understand," Davis said.
"Teaching medical students about
the health -care system and why
it works the way it does can help
students become doctors who help
their patients more effectively."
He added:"A systematic approach
to teaching medical students and
residents more about the health care
system would enhance medical edu-
cation and better prepare people for
the practice of medicine."

A busted budget
Compromise budget must include funding for education
While students were still asleep on Thursday morning,
Michigan's government shut down. A habit repeated
every few years, legislators again failed to pass a bud-
get by the Oct. 1 deadline. Though a complete government shut-
down was temporarily forestalled by the passage of an interim
budget, last week's budget debacle - the state legislature's second
in the past three years - was embarrassing. Legislators need to
do their jobs and make the tough decisions necessary to fix a $1.8
billion deficit. As they make those decisions, they need to keep in
mind this state's future - one that won't be possible if the state

doesn't invest in education.
Last week, legislators narrowly pre-
vented a complete shutdown of Michigan's
government by passing a last-minute, after-
deadline, extension budget that provided
enough money for the government to oper-
ate for another month. This temporary fix
came about because legislators have, after
months of arguing, failed to come to any
agreement about how to fill a $1.8 billion
deficit. Now, they've promised to drag out
the arguments for another month, leaving
issues that immediately impact people's
lives - like whether students will receive
needed financial aid - up in the air.
This situation is absolutely inexcusable.
Producing a budget is the primary task of
our state legislature, and that budget was
due by Oct. 1. Lawmakers knew that get-
ting a budget passed by then would require
making some tough decisions. They didn't
make those decisions and consequently
they missed their deadline. In other words,
they didn't accomplish the basic job they
were elected to do. Instead, they left the
state's financial fate up for grabs for another
month.
While many students probably don't care
much about the nuts and bolts of the Michi-
gan legislature's budget proceedings,-the
financial fate now up for grabs is especially
pertinent to them. Among the numerous
programs on the choppingblock, the Michi-
gan Promise Scholarship has seen its fund-
ing cut from the budget, added back and

cut again so many times that determining
the scholarship's status from hour to hour
has been dizzying. But that legislative see-
saw has consequences. This scholarship
program was expected to provide more
than 6,000 students on this campus with as
much as $4,000 this academic year - a fig-
ure that has an important impact on many
students'lives.
This should gravely concern lawmak-
ers. College students throughout Michigan
are relying on the Promise Scholarship to
attend college this year in the face of ris-
ing tuition costs. That's not to say that
other groups are not being affected by the
state legislature's cuts. Almost everyone
is. But the state's investment in education
is one that will affect our state's long-term
prosperity unlike almost any other issue.
It will determine whether Michigan has a
workforce educated enough to compete in
the 21st century or one that continues to
drive itself into industrial obscurity. Help-
ing these students isn't just an investment in
them, but an investment in the future of the
state economy itself.
Congressional Republicans need to face
the reality that some tax increases are nec-
essary to get the state the revenue it needs.
Democrats, for their part, will have to con-
cede cuts in order to craft a workable budget
for next year. But one area that can't afford a
cut is funding for education. It is simply too
important.

hile browsing the Internet
on Sunday, I came across
Forbes.com's fourth annual
"The best states for
business," which is°
just what it sounds
like - a ranking of
the 50 states based
on their appeal to
businesses. The
article took into
account such fac-
tors as business ROBERT
costs, labor, regula-
tory environment, SOAVE
economic climate,
growth prospects
and quality of life. Even before I
opened up the slideshow with the
results, I wasn't too optimistic about
Michigan's placement.
In all honesty, I wasn't expecting
Michigan to appear until I made it to
the 40s. But it was still depressing as
I cycled through the slideshow, my
slow Internet connection forcing me
to dwell on state after state that is
better off than the one I've lived my
whole life in.
Finally, Michigan made its appear-
ance at No. 49 (if you're curious,
Rhode Island was last). Michigan
was ranked last in the crucial catego-
ries of economic climate and growth
prospects, and also scored badly on
business costs (39th) and labor (46th).
Some of these factors have to do with
the decline of the auto industry and
aren't immediately fixable. But one
contributing factor in Michigan's
failing grade can be fixed and should
be, soon - the astronomical cost of
doing business in this state. In other
words, taxes.
It's somewhat ironic that Michi-
gan's oppressive business tax is such
a pressing concern when the govern-
ment gave it a complete overhaul just

two years ago. The Michigan Busi-
. ness Tax replaced the Single Business
Tax - which was widely regarded as
overly complicated and burdensome
- in January 2008. Jeffrey Guil-
foyle of the Michigan Department
of the Treasury predicted in a study
released in September 2008 that 72
percent of Michigan taxpayers would
pay the same or less under the new
system.
If a government study predicts
something, it must come true, right?
But just one month later, the Michi-
gan Chamber of Commerce conduct-
ed a poll of its members. Of the 700
who responded, about 80 percent
said they paid more in taxes under
the new system. A separate survey by
the Chamber of Commerce found that
the MBT - and the surcharge tacked
on to it - were Michigan's number
one problem.
The 22 percent surcharge, which is
among the most egregiously burden-
some components of the MBT, pays
for tax breaks for the film industry,
among other things. While business-
es in the state struggle to stay afloat
in the midst of a disastrous economy
and mounting tax burden, their dol-
lars are being handed out to already
wealthy studio executives. These
executives are just waiting to flee the
state as soon as the money they're
leeching from local businesses runs
out.
And if the MBT stands for much
longer, the money will run out. I asked
a friend of mine who is a businessman
in the apartment business what his
tax burden is like under the new sys-
tem. He told me that his tax burden
increased substantially from the SBT
to the MBT. And he most certainly
isn't alone. According the Mackinac
Center for Public Policy's Oct. 30,
2008 assessment of the Chamber of
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

Commerce poll, "One-third of those
reporting hikes said the increase was
in excess of 100 percent over the SBT;
eleven percent reported a hike of
more than 300 percent and one mem-
ber reported a tax increase of 1,000
percent." The assessment also found
that 15 percent of those hit with the
tax increase planned to stop expand-
ing or leave the state.
The Michigan
Business Tax will
kill the economy.
So there you have it. Businesses
are leaving Michigan and, if the
Forbes.com ranking is an indication,
no business in its right mind would
ever want to come to Michigan. This
reality should put the state legisla-
ture's current budget debate in an
entirely different context. It doesn't
really matter whether legislators cut
enough programs to solve a multi-
billion-dollar deficit - the deficit is
clearly going to be worse next year
when there are even fewer businesses
left to pay taxes.
If the legislature has any interest
in salvaging the disaster that is the
state economy, it will repeal the MBT
and make Michigan a slightly more
attractive place for business. As long
as the MBT remains, legislators might
as well make it official that their goal
is "No. 50 in 2010!" Rhode Island will
even thank them for it.

MICHELLE DEWITT| W
Celebrities' kids need privacy

My name is Michelle and I am addicted to celebrity gos-
sip. Okay, that's a slight exaggeration. But I do read People
magazine on a regular basis, and I refuse to believe any
information that I did not read on perezhilton.com. I'm
exactly the type of celebrity-crazed lunatic that makes
the planet dumber, but I can't help it.
In spite of this, I do make an exception when it comes
to the children of celebrities. The scrutiny young people
receive from their peers can be disturbingly cruel. In fact,
I am confident that if Dante had been a teenager living
in the 21st century, an army of denim-mini-skirt-clad
middle school girls would have been one of the circles of
hell. But I digress. The point is that dealing with the cruel
judgment of peers is awful all on its own, and even worse
when you add the blogosphere into the mix.
Judgments, sadly, are what the daughters of Span-
ish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero were
recently forced to deal with. Laura, 16, and Alba, 13, with
the help of Spanish laws, had until recently managed to
remain out of the public eye despite being the prime min-
ister's daughters. In Spain, it's against the law for any
media outlets to publish photographs of the girls without
the permission of their parents. This had allowed the girls
to maintain the privacy that children should rightly have.
But when a photograph of the girls with their parents and
Barack and Michelle Obama was put on the White House
flickr page, Laura and Alba were thrust into the spot-
light. The photo was promptly taken off the website, but
the Internet is well-known for keeping things from ever
going away (sorry, Kanye). In addition to the presence of
the photo online, several Spanish newspapers, contrary
to requests of the Spanish government, decided to place
the photo on the front page of their papers. For the first
time in their lives, the girl's faces were all over newspa-

pers and the Internet - and their choices of hairstyle,
makeup and clothing have been extensively ridiculed by
countless websites.
Why is something that is so taboo in Spain no big issue
in the United States? How can there be any debate over
protecting the privacy of children? I don't have a good
answer for this question, because there is no good answer.
The fact that pictures of the children of public figures are
fair game to anyone with a camera is clearly wrong. These
children did not request to be the offspring of celebrities
or politicians, and they should not have to request that
their privacy be protected - that should be a given.
A Google Image search of "Malia Obama" turns up pic-
tures of her as she is being dropped off at school. Paparaz-
zi camp outside of celebrities homes after their children
are born in hopes of procuring the first photographs of
the offspring, which is hugely invasive. Photographers
also follow celebrities to parks, toy stores and other places
where a great number of non-famous children are pres-
ent. Perhaps having the bodyguard equivalent of Andre
the Giant follow celebrity children around every step
would not be as necessary if there were laws in place that
adequately protected the privacy of these children.
We all have awkward phases, but most individuals can
avoid having these phases broadcast to the entire web-
surfing world. Just because a person's parent is a diplo-
mat, movie star, singer, television personality or reality
television star does not mean these young people should
lack basic rights to privacy.
This is truly an issue of common sense - until an indi-
vidual reaches the age of 18, privacy laws should keep
them safe.

Brain-eating brilliance

Mixing humor with
horror, 'Zombieland' proves
its genre isn't dead
By TIMOTHY RABB
DailyArts Writer
A note to the weak of heart: You may think
that "Zombieland" is just
typical slasher material, but
rest assured that Hollywood
has finally made a zom- Zombieland
bie movie that reaches far
beyond its sadistic fan base At Quality16
by taking advantage of our and Showcase
society's love for the darker Columbia
side of humor. Most viewers
will inevitably love "Zom-
bieland" because it simultaneously stirs in
them the two emotions they most love to feel:
amusement and disgust.
The movie attempts sensory overload from
its inception, lambasting the unsuspecting
audience with images of zombie brutality to
give the false impression that the next two
hours will feature pervasive violence with
limited character development. The intro-

duction is a sort of informational montage
on zombie evasion: The hopelessly awkward
protagonist known only as Columbus (Jesse
Eisenberg, "The Squid and the Whale")
explains that, when the zombie infection
began to spread, "the first ones to go were the
fatties."
Because of the inherent dangers in a zom-
bie-tainted society, one must now retain an
internal set of "rules" (a significant motif that
reappears throughout the movie) pertaining
to avoiding and, if necessary, exterminating
zombies. Columbus spends the remainder of
the film navigating the zombie-filled dystopia
armed with only these rules and his hopes of
finding his only remaining kin in central Ohio.
But this solitary, gun-slinging hero couldn't
properly entertain us without a support-
ing cast of equally eccentric acquaintances.
"Zombieland" also features Woody Harrelson
("Natural Born Killers") as Tallahassee, Emma
Stone ("The House Bunny") as Wichita, Abi-
gail Breslin ("Little Miss Sunshine") as Little
Rock, as well as a hilarious cameo. Oh, and if
you couldn't tell, the people in "Zombieland"
only refer to one another by destination to
avoid emotional attachment. How delightfully
dehumanizing.
The best part of the film is its ability to blend

conflicting ideas into a single, balanced com-
position. For example, "Zombieland" employs
significant character development that can
happily co-exist with the guilty pleasure of
witnessing (literally) gut-wrenching acts of
violence. It maintains the breakneck speed
reminiscent of a classic shoot-'em-up arcade
game without seeming confusing or poorly
consolidated. It even manages significance
without having to take itself seriously - this
should come as a breath of fresh air to critics
beleaguered by the steady stream of piss-poor
films that think they've earned a right to exist
just because they have a conscience. And it's
prudent to mention that this work of genius is
the directorial debut of Ruben Fleischer, who
has scarcely any previous directorial experi-
ence short of a few episodes of "Jimmy Kim-
mel Live!" Congratulations are most definitely
in order.
Needless to say, this movie is worth its
weight in U.S. currency - $25 million on its
opening weekend, to be exact. The only possi-
ble detractor from the fun is the inconsequen-
tial nature of the movie's content; it's nearly
impossible to make a masterpiece within the
confines of the zombie genre. But the rest of
the film is so fun that this minor problem is
easy to overlook. Oh, and fuck clowns.

A couple weeks ago, I got
robbed. Apparently the homeless
people here have "balls the size of
watermelons,"
as the cop who
came to my K
house to inves-
tigate the scene (
so eloquently
phrased it. The
scene consisted JOSHUA
of the following: BYER
my Hi-Fi (an
extinct breed of high-fidelity iPod
deck) and my iPod (80 gigabytes,
lots of personality) were swiped
out of my living room window
while seven of my nine housemates
were home.
I really miss my Hi-Fi. It was a
tad dilapidated - at a party, some
rad-ass dudes decided to tamper
with my shrewdly concocted party
playlist and, in the process, anni-
hilated that little metal thingy on
the dock you jack your iPod into.
So I had to prop my iPod up with a
Balderdash box and sticky tack for
it to even play in there. (Yes, the
crookshanks swiped my Balder-
dash box, too - bummer, right?)
Regardless, that Hi-Fi had seri-
ous nostalgic value, and losing it
was not on my shortlist of things I
wanted to happen.
As far as my iPod, I shelled
out for a new one in less than 24
hours. I am umbilically attached to
my iPod. It's a little bit sickening.
Sometimes I get really anxious that
I care more about music than about
people.
ButI digress. Since my iPod
got hijacked, I've been manically
downloading all the noteworthy
music that's come out this year.
I get incredibly OCD about mak-
ing my end-of-the-year list and
have been compulsively tryingto
listen to every 2009 album that
could possibly hit my buzzer. And
a clean-slate iPod was the perfect
excuse for me to force-feed myself
a stringent musical diet of only this
year's releases.
My witch-hunt for favorites has
taken me to Metacritic. I'll scroll
dog-mouthed down the screen,
searching for albums with little
white stars next to them (denoting
universal acclaim). Pitchfork has
also been a trusted source - I've
brownnosed around the Internet
for everything it brands as "Best
New Music." And, although these
methods have fished me a lot of
quality hours of music listening,
they feel a little bit formed to me
- molded by something outside of
my control.
How much control do we really
have over our own culture? For
the most part, we're all funneling
our knowledge of career-defining
albums and breakout bands
through these trusted sources
that manufacture "buzz" for us:
Metacritic; Pitchfork; Pandora. I
mean, there's always the endless
sea of blogs out there to ravage, but
I spend an ungodly amount of time
thinking about music as it is. And I,
an unthinking robot receptacle of
this bourgeoisie buzz, could make
a blog myself, simply spitting back
my own permutations of the com-

I know this all sounds a little
nihilistic and doomy - the furrow-
browed child of information age
angst - but, in reality, most of us
are getting our information from
mass amalgamators of the same
source: everyone.
How does buzz travel? Word
of mouth. And who has word of
mouth? Everyone. But then why do
I feel like my word of mouth is so
determined by these buzz bands
that have conveniently popped up
for me on the surface of the infor-
mation superhighway?
Now, I understand I'm whining
about my lack of ability to create
culture from the high and mighty
throne of music columnist. I can
mold your minds right now. I can
tell you what to listen to. And the
obvious place to start is with local
music. I may be relying on these
homogenizingbuzz-filters to be
my ears in the rest of the coun-
try, but the least I could do is go
out and comb the streets of Ann
Arbor for bands that deserve to
blow up.
And I probably should. But how
much power do I actually have?
I never really know these things.
Let's say I randomly go out to the
Bling Pig one night and see this
groundbreaking local krautrock
rock band nobody's ever heard of.
Is anybody
listening to me?
I can devote an entire column to
its consecration and balloon its
buzz quotient in the city of Ann
Arbor. But is the buzz fallout from
The Michigan Daily expansive
enough to set off the buzz detec-
tors on a national cultural icon like
Pitchfork? Is it mighty enough to
be absorbed into such a prominent
information body and shat out sub-
jectively for mass consumption?
No. And in all honesty, does that
even matter?
Whynot just embrace the infor-
mation overload that blog-buzz
culture has deluged us with? Sure,
we're all jacking into similar sourc-
es for upcoming album release
dates and "Best New Music." But
we've attached ourselves to these
sources for a reason: They give us a
lot of choices and they've shown as
a lot of good music. It's intimidat-
ing enough to rifle through all the
music that pops up on the coun-
try's infrastructural buzz meter.
And, truly, the gratification I get
from siftingthrough these break-
out bands in my head with my
biased, idiosyncratic rating system
is purely narcissistic. Why sit there
and worry about how much control
I have over my own taste when it's
so much more fun to converge with
my brother robots and warmly
accept the fact that Merriweather
Post Pavilion is objectively the best
album of the year?

NBC's new traumatic experience

By ANT MITCHELL
For the Daily
Half a look at lives of medics and
half a glance at
fast-paced doc-
toring,"Trauma"
is unique among
medical dramas Irau
in that it's not set Mondays
in an emergency at 9 p.m.
room, hospital or NBC
operating room.
But aside from
its setting, "Trauma" holds no
other claim to originality and no
strengths that sufficiently combat
its shortcomings.
The show begins one year ago,
detailing the events of a helicop-
ter-rescue disaster and the lives
of the paramedics involved. From
there, the show moves forward to
the anniversary of the accident,
during which a collage of charac-
ters is introduced, with each one

experiencing various personal
problems including job pressure,
marital indiscretions, returning
from service overseas and coming
back to the job after involuntary
leave. Despite all this, most of the
characters lack presence, and as
such they're easily forgotten when
they're not shown performing
CPR.
The opening catastrophe adds
a fair amount of complexity to
characters who already have mini-
dramas playing out in both their
jobs and daily lives. However, the
special effects are barely better
than a blast of orange and yellow
light and pieces of strange black
metal flailing about, all contained
in the outline of an atom bomb.
Better, to be sure - but only barely.
In some cases, low-budget special
effects wouldn't be a particular
concern. "Trauma" is rooted in
medicine and blood, as well as the
material expense of multiple heli-

copter flights, so it's almost par-
donable that the fire and fury look
cut and pasted. Unfortunately, a
good chunk of the plot that follows
is built around the resulting per-
sonal baggage this single dramatic
event creates, and the five minutes
of unconvincing screaming used to
depict it just doesn't do it justice.
Further detracting from a show
that might still have pulled a mea-
Worse than 'a
hospital visit.
ger audience is the dialogue - at
times far beyond corny and often
uncomfortable to hear. From "He'll
die, Joe" (dramatic music cue) right
before a commercial break to sun-
set-silhouetted confessions made
next to ambulances, poor dialogue
has "Trauma" cross-dressing from

drama to soap and back in all-too-
quick succession.
One redeeming aspect of the
show, though, is Reuben "Rabbit"
Palchuck(CliffCurtis, "Push"),who
was simultaneously entertaining
and unconvincing. He is undoubt-
edly the most eccentric character,
seemingly a jerk one moment, but
saving a child the next. And after
cuttingoff someone's finger by driv-
ing recklessly, he apologizes pro-
fusely, ranting about his inability
to die. Finally, he humbly serves as
the counseling friend. Though his
character is inherently not believ-
able, he is just bipolar enough to
claim curiosity among the general
mediocrity.
Basically, find something else
productive to do on a Monday
night. If that fails, channel flick,
remaining on "Trauma" for no
longer than five minutes. With any
luck, no words will be spoken dur-
ing that brief interval.

'My One and Only' matures into a terrible movie

-

SIU D 0 K U

By EMILY BOUDREAU
DailyArts Writer
"My One and Only" is an improbably strange
attempt to tell the story of a boy named George
(Logan Lerman, "3:10 to
Yuma") who comes of age
while on a road trip with
his mildly deranged mother My Onel
(Renee Zellweger, "New in
Town"). George spends most
of his time pouring through At the State
the pages of J.D. Salinger's Herrick
"Catcher in the Rye," while
director Richard Lon-
craine ("Firewall") attempts to draw parallels
between the boy and Holden Caulfield. But
Locraine's extended comparisons are about as
restrained as a beating over the head with the
book itself.
The movie tries to establish a balance
between a story about growing up and a story
about a dysfunctional family. However, the
. coming-of-age story never really goes any-
where and instead just subserves itself to
the plotline of the film. There's a tiny blip of
romance in George's life, but that's about it.
"My One and Only" is stuck in the awkward
phase of adolescence despite the fact that it

strives for a more mature form of artiness.
The only particularly amusing charac-
ters are the polygamist Bill Massey (David
Koechner, "Get Smart") and Robbie (Mark
Rendall, "The Exploding Girl"), George's
flamboyant brother who loves acting and
wearing his mother's jewelry and clothes.
Though they're empty caricatures, they pro-
vide a few laughs on the hellish road trip. Bill
Massey is particularly good when he talks to
George about women - he tells him that they
are either too hot or too cold, literally refer-
ring to temperature rather than making some
sort of innuendo.
While the cast includes names like Kevin
Bacon ("Frost/ Nixon"), Chris North ("Sex
and the City: The Movie") and Eric McCor-
mack ("Will and Grace"), these stars don't
get a chance to stand out, instead falling into
boring stereotypes. Bacon is particularly dull
as father Dan Deveraux, who fails to be more
than a womanizer who undergoes a miracu-
lous and artificial change of heart. Zellweger
isn't at her best either as she tries to portray
a terrible mother attempting to be clever, ele-
gant and vivacious. Instead, she comes across
as washed-out and desperate.
Zellweger's character might also insult
some women. She tries to get married to

just about any wealthy man she meets and
exploits her wannabe suitors shamelessly.
She supposedly learns she can get along
without a man in her life, but doesn't realize
it soon enough. It seems like she comes to this
conclusion merely because she either gives up
trying or because she gets too old to attract
anyone wealthy enough.
Worst of all, the ending is a contrived,
everyone-lives-happily-ever-after affair. The
problem here is that it's impossible to like any
of the characters enough to really care wheth-
er or not they end up happy. In fact, Robbie,
A complete waste of
a talented cast.
the only character really worth caring about
(if only for his snide remarks) gets written off
as a side note. For the most part, the charac-
ters don't grow or change. The only difference
is that George decides his mom is tolerable,
and she decides she doesn't need a husband.
Of course, these conclusions make their time
spent on the road meeting polygamists and
grumpy aunts a complete waste of time.

For Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2009
ARIES
(March 21to April 19)
Avoid making promises to groups and
friends that you might find hard to keep.
In particular, these promises could relate
to cash flow, earnings, money or some-
thing you own.
TAURUS
(April 20to May 20)
The Moon is in your sign today, which
gives you a little bit of extra good luck.
However, be careful that you don't
promise more than you can deliver to
bosses, parents, teachers and VIPs. Easy
does it. Stay realistic.
GEMINI
(May 21 toJune 20)
This is a wonderfully quiet, spiritual
day for you. You feel unusually warm-
hearted and at peace with yourself. In
part, this is because you feel loving
toward others.
CANCER
(June 21 to July 221
This is a great day to schmooze with
people. In particular, you feel very gen-
erous toward others. Group discussions
about religion, philosophy and lofty top-
ics are likely.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Some aspect of your private life will
be made public today. However, you
won't mind, because you come out
smelling like a rose! (Just don't overdo
things.)
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
You're very keen to learn new things
today, especially about religion, politics,
philosophy, metaphysics and anything
that's different and intriguing. You feel
very positive about life.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
You're feeling generous to others
today; however, don't give away the

farm. Think twice if you have to divide
something with someone else.
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
In discussions with partners and close
friends, you' won't be concerned with
details today. You feel happy, which is
why you're focusing on the big picture.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22to Dec. 21)
Co-workers will be helpful to you, and
vice versa, today. However, detailed
work is subject to errors because you're
doing a lot very quickly.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)
This is a marvelous day to party!
Enjoy the company of others.
Emotionally, you feel great, and you
want to have a good time.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20to Feb. 18)
If you're making real estate deals
today, double-check everything.
However, entertaining at home will be a
fun occasion for you and family.
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
Be careful not to go overboard buying
something today. Whatever you do,
you're doing it in very broad strokes!
Other people might overreact to this.
Stay focused, and be observant.
YOU BORN TODAY You have a mar-
velous zest for life. People enjoy your
company because you are optimistic and
enthusiastic. You also have a strong
desire to help others. In your personal
relationships, you can be very loving.
You're a wonderful friend to others, and
your social skills are superb. This year,
something you've been involved with
for about nine years will end in order to

DEVELOPMENT
From Page 1A
lead to groundbreaking discoveries
in their industry. Foundations from
across the globe give to the Univer-
sity, as well, helping to solve some
of the world's most pressing social
issues, like homelessness, illiteracy
and environmental destruction.
At the University, donors know
their money can support virtually
any cause they desire - ensuring
thatUniversitystudentswillremain
the leaders and the best. And all
this rests on the shoulders of offi-
cials in the Development Office to
make sure that this steady stream
of support continues to flow.
In the first part of a five-part
series, today's article will look at
the growing significance of the
Development Office in campus life.
AN INVESTMENT
UNLIKE ANY OTHER
"This University intends to con-
tinue to become one of the world's
leaders in higher education," Vice
President for Development Jerry
May said in an interview last
month. "The only way that is going
to happen is if we continue to make
philanthropic partners a big part of
the quality of this institution, so we
will continue to grow philanthropy
and have high aspirations for rais-
ing more money in the future."
The University's rich history
of philanthropic support, May
said, remains a key element of the
school's growth and development.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman has made similar remarks,
includingaspeechshegave duringthe
MichiganDifference Campaign finale
celebration last November, where she
called a donation to the University "an
investmentunlike anyother."
"It is an enterprise that advances
worthy ideals, creates productive
jobs and opens the doors to possi-
bilities for the students who walk
through them," she said at the time.
In the current economic situ-
ation, the importance of philan-
thropy has become increasingly
clear. As state support to the Uni-
versity continues to fall, a void is
left to be filled by private support or
increased tuition on students who,
many say, are already at their finan-
cial breaking points.
While the state's budget situation
remains unclear, appropriations
for the University are estimated to
decrease by $10.4 million. At the
same time, the University's Board
of Regents passed a budget in June
with close to $200 million in added
expenses from last year.
Chrissi Rawak, assistant vice
president for talent management
and development operations, said
the development office is working
to try to alleviate the pressures the
state's shrinking budget is having
on students.
"I think what is really important,
now more than ever, with the state's
funding decreasing, we need to be
sure we can continue to provide the
exceptional education experience
for students," she said.
The office plans to do that by
reaching out to donors, who Rawak
said typically donate on their own
accord because they want to give
back to the University.
"Generally speaking, the donor
raises their hand, and we work
with them to identify what their
passions are for the institution and
giving back to Michigan, and (we)
drive any kind of gift conversations

that may happen," Rawak said.
Rawak - who is also a University
alum - said as a student she never

realizedhowvitalprivatedonations
are for the University to operate.
She added that she feels fortunate
to play a part in making students'
time at the University either equal
or better than what her class got to
experience.
"It's a very rewarding experience
to be able to do that because you want
Michigan students to have the best
and to experience the best, and I think
that donors care a lot about providing
thattoourstudents," she said.
Though an integral to the Univer-
sity's operations, May said private
support to higher education is some-
thing unique to the United States.
"Philanthropy is one of the dis-
tinguishing features of the Ameri-
can culture," May said, adding that
it's gaining attention in other parts
of the world. "Higher education
philanthropy is something we're
very fortunate to have in this par-
ticular society."
Coleman and May are by no
means the first to recognize the
importance of private giving to the

of Development set a new national
record when it announced its Mich-
iganDifference Campaignraised an
unheard of $3.2 billion. The previ-
ous record had been set by the Uni-
versity of California Los Angeles,
which raised $3.1 billion.
Today, the Office of Develop-
ment employs 160 employees who
work on the eighth, ninth and tenth
floors of Wolverine Tower, where
they plan and execute the Univer-
sity's development strategy at all
three campuses.
Additionally, 320 staff work in
other locations across Ann Arbor,
as well as in Flint and Dearborn to
encourage alumni and friends of
the University to donate.
In total, the University has 43
fundraising units between the
three campuses including academ-
ic units and other entities, like the
University of Michigan Museum of
Art and the Athletic Department.

across the campus helps enhance

Though much of its support
comes from individuals, the devel-
opment office also partners with
both foundations and corporations.
Through it's Business Engage-
ment Center, the University col-
laborates with companies to fund
research projects of all sizes at the
University. Focusing on real-world
problems, these studies can result
in new findings that help compa-
nies overcome obstacles they face.
A department in the Develop-
ment Office works closely with
foundation leaders to demonstrate
how projects at the University
can help solve societal problems.
This can be especially attractive
to foundations, as many nonprofits
are established to combat a specific
issue of public concern.
Despite the large gifts that corpo-
rations and foundations often make
to the University, individuals - both
alumni and non-alumni - still com-
pose the largest group of donors.
Non-alumni, known in fundrais-
ing jargon as friends of the Univer-
sity, include individuals who give to
the University because a spouse or
family member graduated from the
University, they or someone they
know has benefited from a Univer-
sity service - like the University of
Michigan Health System - or they,
for whatever reason, are supportive
of the institution.
Many graduates also give to
the University. While the major-
ity of alumni live in the country,
the University's alumni population
is becoming increasingly inter-
national. With large numbers of
students coming from the Univer-
sity's partnership in China and an
increasingly international business
environment, alumni are livingand
working overseas at higher rate
than ever before.
While many on campus recog-
nize the names of major donors, for
whom buildings and facilities are
named, most individuals give gifts
of less than $25,000. Though their
gifts may be small in comparison,
the collective amount of money
raised from these donors quickly
adds up - and can re-shape stu-
dents' experiences on campus.

laws" in a statement he prepared
for tonight's meeting and released
to the Daily.
Additionally, Chaffin believes
his past willingness to speak
openly about his differing views
has led to tonight's proceedings.
Atop the list of these past inci-
dents is an interview expected
to be published Thursday in The
Michigan Independent, a left-
leaning campus publication, in
which Chaffin referred to the 9/12
rally - a Glenn Beck-led march
on Washington, D.C. protesting
the proliferation of government
spending and health care reform
- as "misguided," though he did
mention that they were real people
with real concerns, which is para-
phrased in the article. Chaffin for-
warded to the Daily a transcript of
his quotes in the article that was
provided to him by Jane Lawrence
of the Independent.
In the interview, Chaffin also
tried to dispel what he believed
were myths about the death panel
argument in the health care debate
- which claims an earlier version
of the health care bill would set
up government panels to decide
whether elderly people live or die.
"In its original legislative lan-
guage, it was basically saying that
the government would provide
counsel to people nearing the
end of their life," he said, "(and)
as someone who's gone through
hospice care with a couple of my
grandparents, this is something
that is incredibly helpful. It makes
dying respectable and peaceful ...
it isn't at all like the government
or some company pushing death
upon your loved one."
Chaffin said he also drew criti-
cism from group members for
comments he posted on his Face-
book page supporting Obama's
health care plan.
"Gordon Chaffin is a supporter
of President Obama's Healthcare
Reform Plan ... while it has faults
... the totality of the plan is strong,
will provide coverage to unisured
(sic), cut costs, provide security
and choice ... I VOTE YEA MR.

PRESIDENT!" he wrote on his
Facebook page on Sept. 9.
In an e-mail to the group's
executive board providedby Chaf-
fin, Events Chair Anthony Dzik, a
Business sophomore, wrote that
though Chaffin argues the quotes
were meant to represent his own
view, his actions represent the
club's views too.
"Although the chair may claim
he is expressing his individual
opinions, that does not remove
himfromthe responsibility ofrep-
resenting the club," Dzik wrote,
"just as the actions of former pres-
ident G. W. Bush reflected poorly
on Republicans as a whole even
though many of us did not fully
support all of his actions."
Dzik wrote that he is pushing
for nothing "less than a censure
of our chair," though such a pro-
cedure does not currently exist
within the group's bylaws.
In the e-mail, Dzik proposed
that with a censure of the presi-
dent, the vice president would
assume the group's top position.
"While currently I am will-
ing to suggest the fairly trivial
punishment of censure, if only to
distance the club from your negli-
gence," Dzik wrote in the e-mail,
addressing Chaffin, "I suggestthat
any future behavior that need be
censured cease, otherwise I will
question your ability to carry out
your office."
In response to Dzik's e-mail,
Chaffin replied with an e-mail
statement to College Republican
executive board members.
In the statement, he defended
his views and discussed what he
knows of the proceedings.
Chaffin said he plans to attend
tonight's meeting to stand up for
his beliefs.
"I will be there to talk and dis-
cuss my situation, but I will not
cave in on the fact that I have the
rights to say what I want," Chaf-
fin said.
"And if they believe that my
views - when they are not offen-
sive, sexist, not racist and not
controversial at all - when they
believe that my views are harm-
ful, then fine, we disagree and I
move forward, without the club,"
he said.

After opening its Flint and Dear-
born campuses in 1956, the Uni-
versity established the Office of
Development in the early 1960s to
facilitate fundraising efforts at all
three campuses.
In 1964, the University began
another capital campaign, this time
with a goal of raising $55 million.
Exceeding its expectations, the
campaign raised $74 million.
Three campaigns followed, with
one in the 1980s that raised $187
million and one in the 1990s that
raised $1.37 billion - making it the
first fundraising campaign by a
public university to raise more than
$1 billion. .

the numbers are telling: four from
Michigan, 13 from the South or the

For Dantonio's 2009 class: 13
from Michigan, two from the West
and South.
It's not that in-state talent is
choosing Dantonio - it's that
Rodriguez is choosing out-of-
state talent. While speaking at the
Detroit Economic Club last Thurs-
day, Martin was clear that Rodri-
guez's national appeal was part of
the reason Martin brought him to
Michigan.
"That's why, in recruiting Rich, I
was looking for a coach who played
a more up-tempo spread offense
type that you see on the field today
at Michigan and secondly, has
recruiting in-roads into the South
and theWest," Martinsaid onOct. 1,
according to the Detroit Free Press.
Rodriguez is about the national
scene. He understands the Ohio
State rivalry because it's a national
rivalry. Across the country, the
Michigan-Michigan State rivalry
carries little weight. At this point
in his Michigan career, the annual
intra-state matchup is just another
chance for him to get a win.
For Michigan State, winning
the intra-state battle can change
the whole season. Just ask Spartan

wideout Blair White.
"It doesn't feel like we're 2-3,"
White said. "It feels like we're 5-0."
Don't scoff at White. For the
Michigan State, it's true. This
might have felt like four wins for

the Spartans.
But with Rodriguez at the helm,
it's just one loss for Michigan.

VOLLEYBALL
Hard-nosed liberos play tough in
Michigan's first conference stumble

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
After spending six months
thinking about how Air Force shut
out their team in a shocking first-
round NCAA Tournament loss,
the Wolverines needed just 13 sec-
onds of their new season to score
a goal. Sophomore defenseman
Brandon Burlon took a pass and
snuck a wrist shot into the back of
the net almost immediately after
the start of the Wolverines' first
exhibition game against the U.S.
National Team Development Pro-
gramUnder-18 team.
"Itwas agood confidence boost,"
Burlon said. "You saw that later on
in the game. We were playingwell,
we were playing strong and feed-
ing off of that first goal."
What didn't immediately
change from a year ago was the
inconsistency on the power play.
Last season was the program's
worst power play in 25 years, con-
verting at just 15.8 percent.
Michigan went just 1-for-7 in
Saturday's 4-2 winbefore rebound-
ing with a 3-for-7 performance

By MARK BURNS
Daily Sports Writer
During the middle of the second
set Saturday against No. 12 Illinois,
Michigan volleyball libero Sloane
Donhoff took a line-drive kill off
her left cheek that reverberated
all the way to the Cliff Keen Arena
press box.
The monstrous blast left the
Louisville, Ky. native stumbling
backwards but she shook off the
hit and helped the sixth-ranked
Wolverines defeat the Fighting
Illini 25-22 in the frame to give the
team a commanding2-0 advantage
heading into the intermission.
"We knew coming in that it was
going to be one of those matches
where there wasn't going to be
much room for error," Michigan
coach Mark Rosen said. "The first
two games, we played exceptional.
We played hard on defense and we
seemed to find ways to dig balls
and create scoring opportunities
off those."
But after the 12-minute break,
Michigan stumbled on its offensive
opportunities. According to Rosen,

the Wolverines "got a little too
comfortable" and sat back in the
late stages of the match.
The relaxed state and inability
to cash in on the offensive attack
cost the team as Illinois came from
behind and defeated Michigan (3-1
Big Ten, 15-2 overall) in a heart-
breaking five-set match.
"We played well tonight, and that
is why it stings," senior right side
hitter Megan Bower said. "When
you play against good teams and
the caliber of our conference - it
is the little things that matter and
that is what bit us tonight."
Because the Wolverines weren't
at their prime offensively against
the Illini (2-2, 10-3), it's hard not
to look at this match as purely a
heartbreaking defeat.
Bower and Donhoff - the two
leaders in digs on the team - dis-
played why they are two of the
best defensive specialists in the Big
Ten.
The two had 18 digs each in the
losing effort. Both players show-
cased their grittiness by keeping
balls alive at the net, diving on the
floor and getting hit in the face

every now and then, as Donhoff
did.
Donhoff is attempting to replace
libero Kerry Hance, who gradu-
ated last year, and she is filling the
position well. The sophomore is
currently No. 2 in the Big Ten with
4.40 digs per set.
"(Sloane) is a defensive libero,"
Rosen said. "Kerry Hance was a
much more passing libero. That
was her strength and she played
good defense, but passing was
when she was really going to do her
work. Sloane does both."
But despite the hard-nosed
efforts by the two players, the
offense just wasn't there, hitting at
a .163 clip. The offensive attack will
need toresurface as Michigantakes
the road this upcoming weekend to
face Iowa and Wisconsin.
"When you're playing well
enough to win a match, and it slips
away, there is nothing more frus-
trating for an athlete," Rosen said.
"We don't want this to create a
mentality that is, 'Oh my god, the
sky is falling.' We didn't do enough
to win a match and next time out,
we have to finish it."

Wolverines get first look at
touted 2010 recruiting class

For college
footballfans, OT
reigns supreme

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Writer
It wasn't the way Jack Camp-
bell wanted to make his Yost Ice
Arena debut.
Thirteen seconds into Satur-
day's game, the highly touted
goaltending recruit watched the
Michigan hockey team's first shot,
a wrister from sophomore defen-
seman Brandon Burlon, go past
him and into the back of the net.
The Michigan commit and
starting goalie for the U.S. Nation-
al Team Development Program
Under-18 team was let his nerves
and the crowd get the best of him.
"My nerves never usually nega-
tively affect me," Campbell said.
"But I got a little nervous. I really
wanted to show everyone what
they're getting next year."
Despite Campbell's rough start
to the game, NTDP coach Kurt
Kleinendorst said his young net-
minder did exactly that.
"Michigan fans are in for a
treat, because they're getting an

awful good goaltender," Kleinen-
dorst said. "Jack is going to come
in here for four years, and at some
point he's going to fit in, no matter
what."
Campbell may have allowed
four goals in the NTDP's 4-2 loss
to the Wolverines, but his presence
in the net was definitely felt, grab-
bing 35 saves in the losing effort.
And instead of providing the
normal treatment for an oppos-
ing goalie, the Michigan student
section was well aware that the
17-year-old goaltender will soon be
donning the maize and blue.
Midway through the third peri-
od of Saturday's game as Campbell
took his mask off, the student sec-
tion cheered "handsome goalie,"
which they usually shout at the
Michigan goaltender.
Then, as Campbell made his
way to the opposing bench, the
students behind him turned their
attention again to the Port Huron
native.
This time, they cheered, "stay
in school," a plea to Campbell in

hopes that he will forgo the NHL
until he spends a full four years at
Michigan. In recent years, highly
ranked recruits like Aaron Palush-
aj, Max Pacioretty and Jack John-
son left with two or more seasons
of remaining eligibility.
For Campbell, the attention
from the student section only
solidified his plans to become a
Wolverine next season.
"I was honored," Campbell said.
"They want me here and I want to
be here, so it should be a great fit.
But they haven't seen the best of
me yet, and hopefully I'll be able to
show them that soon."
Aside from Campbell, the Wol-
verines got their first look at three
other commitments from the high-
ly anticipated class of 2010.
After Michigan coach Red
Berenson said last week that he
wanted to give his defensemen
more opportunities on offense,
defensive recruit Jon Merrill
showed off his skills with the
puck, scoring one of the NTDP's
two goals on the night. He has two

goals in four games for the NTDP.
Just like Campbell, Merrillgrew
up watching Michigan hockey,
hoping that one day he could play
at Yost Ice Arena. But even Mer-
rill acknowledges how deep the
Michigan defense is this year and
presumably will be next year.
"There's a lot of big players out
there," Merrill said. "Wherever
they need me next year, whatever I
can do to win games, I'll do."
Merrill and Campbell were the
two highest-rated Michigan com-
mitments to visit Yost Ice Arena,
but Berenson and the Wolverines
also got a look at forward Luke
Moffatt and defenseman Kevin
Clare, who combined for three
shots on the night.
Michigan's coaches and players
couldn't comment on the play of
Michigan's recruits since Camp-
bell, Merrill, Clare and Moffatt
have yet to sign with the Wolver-
ines. But Michigan fans got their
first look at what is slated to be
one of the best recruiting classes
in recent history.

It didn't matter that the Michi-
gan men's soccer team didn't wear
its maize uniforms, because by the
end of yesterday's game against
Wisconsin, there had been more
than enough yellow on the field.
In the Wolverines' 3-0 victory
over the Badgers, thereferees called
32 fouls and gave out 10 yellow
cards, with five going to Michigan
- the most this season.
"The word to our guys was that
we were playingthe team in red, not
the guys in blue," Michigan coach
Steve Burns said of the referees.
"Just think of them as bad weather
- you just can't do anything about
it, so just adjust to the bad weather
and play."
The Wolverines acclimated
themselves right out of the gates,
taking an early one-goal lead at the
U-M Soccer Complex.
Less than eight minutes into the
game, senior Mauro Fuzetti played
a ball to junior Jeff Quijano on the
far right side of the field. Quijano
lofted the ball towards the back
side of the goal where Fuzetti was
making a run. The forward broke
through two defenders and sent
a low header to the left side of the
goal, for his team-leading 10th goal
of the season.
Nearly 70 minutes and 10 yellow
cards later, junior Justin Meram
scored the Wolverines' second goal,
a quick header, two passes off of a
corner kick. That was after the Bad-
gers were forced to play down a man
following Badger midfielder Austin
Spohn's second yellow card of the
game, which resulted in his expul-
sion from the contest.
"At 1-0, the game hung in the bal-
ance way too long," Burns said. "I

system and lack
of a playoffs, and others of you
might take issue with market-
ing and selling merchandise
for a team of players that legal-
ly can't reap those benefits.
But there's no question that they
got this right.
College overtime just plays
out so dramatically - and justly.
Each team gets equal oppor-
tunity to tighten the chinstrap
and win the game. No questions
asked, none of this "We'll take
the wind" bullcrap. Just more
football until one team comes out
victorious.
I feel like it's exactly what over-
time should be. Exciting, tense,
nerve-racking and not too far off
the actual style of a real game.
I mean, go back to Nov. 1, 2003

ican sport right
now - every other sports entity
wants to emulate it and its far-
reaching popularity, but the NFL's 4
overtime is boring.
Well, not boring. Anticlimactic
is probably a better word. It's not
exactly exhilarating to wait and
see which team can manage to get
into field-goal range first.
And unlike hockey, a game can't
be decided solely on an individual's
performance, like when a game is
forced into a shootout.
So, yeah, you may have had a
tough time getting over the game
on Saturday. And you might have
had to ignore a few text messag-
es from friends in East Lansing.
But at least you got to see a good
game.

Senior Mauro Fuzetti scored his team-leading 10th goal of the season-in Sunday's 3-0 shutout victory over Wisconsin.

I

thought we had a couple chances to
put daggers in on them and really
close the game out, but they con-
tinued to fight and battle. Really,
the difference was they had to play
down a man."
The Wolverines didn't wait much
longer after the second goal to pile
on their third goal of the day, as
freshman Hamoody Saad notched
his fourth goal of the season.
Saad has gained attention this
season as a legitimate offensive
threat for the Wolverines. And his
presence on the field, along with
Fuzetti's and Meram's, has turned
heads. The offensive triad boasts

18 of the Wolverines' 26 goals this
season.
Their ability to work as a unit
on the field has given Michigan
more offensive options this season
because the three can keep posses-
sion in attacking situations.
"You could put the three of those
guys in a phone booth with three
defenders, and they could playtheir
way out ofthatphone booth," Burns
joked.
Meanwhile, on the back half of
the field, redshirt sophomore Chris
Blais notched his fourth shutout of
the season with two saves, includ-
ing one diving recovery that would

have tied the game at 1-1.
With the victory, the Wolver-
ines are now 5-0 on their home
field. Michigan welcomes No. 9
Indiana to Ann Arbor next week-
end with redemption on thp line.
Last season, the Hoosiers ended
Michigan's season in the Sweet 16
round of the NCAA Tournament.
"We just need to play tough and
have the confidence that we can
beat any Big Ten team," Fuzetti
said. "We have Indiana next,
they're known as the strongest
team in the Big Ten, so this is a
great win to build momentum on
going into that game."

now. But we have to see who's
ready to do the job right now."
One ready to play right now is
junior forward Carl Hagelin. He
had four goals on the weekend,
including three-of-four of his
team's power play markers.
"I can't tell you he has shown
that type of fit (in the power play)
up until now," Berenson said.
"I think Carl felt that he played
very well last year, but he wasn't

capitalizing on his chances. Now
you can see the puck's going in for
him."
Hagelin's most impressive play
came near the end of the second
period. After receiving a cross-
ice pass, he used his speed to gain
a step on the Windsor defense.
With a hard cut toward the goal,
he sent a backhand into the lower
left corner of the net. The goal
broke a 2-2 tie and helped the
sparse student section breathe a
collective sigh of relief.
Unlike Hagelin, freshman A.J.
Treais isn't having any trouble
scoring early in his career. He put

up a goal and an assist in both of
this weekend's games.
An U.S. NTDP alum, Treais
scored the first goal of his career
against his former team. He said
it was fun to play against them,
but was also nervous about trying
to prove himself to the Michigan
coaches.
Berenson didn't see those
nerves as he compared him to
former Wolverine and current
Colorado Avalanche forward T.J.
Hensick after the game.
Despite the praise, Treais had a
tough time fitting in on the power
play this weekend. He saw the ice

more than any other freshman
forward on the Wolverine power
play, but was on the ice for just
one of the power play goals.
"It's not something that comes
together right away," Burlon said.
"When we start to develop a com-
fort level with each other, and
(start) knowing what the other
person is goingto do, we'll be bet-
ter."
The Wolverines open the regu-
lar season in Alaska next week-
end, and whether they score in
13 seconds or not, the sting of last
year may have finally started to
recede.

'M' Note: Men's golf

The No. 15 Michigan men's
golf team can comfortably sleep
tonight, as it remains strong
in second place at the Windon
Memorial Classic.
Fifteen of the nation's best
teams have gathered to face off
at the event. Tournament rules
take the lowest four scores of
each team's five players.
The Wolverines currently sit
at 16 above par, behind No. 13
Illinois who is at 13 above par.
The team is made up of
junior Lion Kim, sophomores
Matt Thompson and Alex Fran-
kel and freshmen Rahul Bakshi
and Jack Schultz.
The Wolverine corps bested
the competition in round one,
posting a score of 293. Round
two was cut early to accommo-

date for darkness and will con-
tinue today.
The squad is currently able
to boast 16 birdies thru the cur-
rent round, and 22 bogeys. The
team will have to fight back
and make up for the three loss
strokes they suffer against Illi-
nois.
"The conditions were tough
and it's a really difficult course.
Our guys really gotoff to a great
start," Michigan Coach Andy
Sapp said. "If we can get a few
birdies, we can battle our way
closer to Illinois."
The Wolverines will continue
their quest for victory today at
8 a.m. CST. Check tomorrow's
Michigan Daily for full cover-
age of the event.

SPARTANS
From page 1B
Michigan's only real shot for
a touchdown drive in the first
half, he was sacked on third
down and called for intentional
grounding.
Even Michigan's Big Ten-
leading rushing game - which
had averaged over 240 yards per
game - failed them. Senior run-
ning backs Carlos Brown and
Brandon Minor combined for a
miserable 17 yards on 10 carries
Saturday, and the leading rusher
on both teams was Michigan
State's quarterback.
But if there was a game for
the offense to look lackluster,
a game against the mediocre-
at-best Spartans was it. The
Wolverines managed to keep it
close the whole game, thanks to
a flurry of Spartan penalties and
critical stops by the Michigan
defense.
"We just came out, you know,
and knew we had to step up,"
sophomore nose tackle Mike
Martin said. "The offense was
struggling a little bit, but we got
their back. Nobody's pointing
fingers after this game."
Instead of the offense bailing
out the defense, which happened

often last week against Indiana
in an ugly 36-33 Wolverine win,
the defense tried to give the
offense two critical chances to
showcase its flashiness.
But for the first time this sea-
son, the offense couldn't take
advantage of the opportunities.
One of those was on the first
Michigan State drive of the
game, on a Stevie Brown inter-
ception that gave Michigan the
ball deep in Spartan territory.
But instead of going ahead by
seven early, the Wolverines
managed to lose five total yards
on the drive before settling for a
field goal.
The other, a fumble recov-
ery by Obi Ezeh, was midway
through the fourth quarter, with
thegame at apivotalmomentand
the Wolverines getting desper-
ate. But two plays later, Darryl
Stonum fumbled the ball right
back to the Spartans inside the
Michigan State 20-yard line.
Instead, Michigan's first big
offensive play didn't come until
almost 56 minutes into the
game. Forcier chucked a 29-yard
pass to Stonum that the sopho-
more caught before juking past
two Spartan defenders, pushing
one away with his free hand and
running faster than two more en
route to a 60-yard score to pull
Michigan within seven.

In the end, even though
Michigan State was technically
favored in Vegas by a field goal,
the 1-3 Spartans played the part
of the spoiler well. They were
chippy and aggressive the whole
game, talking trash between
plays and garnering four per-
sonal foul penalties. Their post-
game celebration felt almost like
winning a bowl game instead of
an in-state rivalry contest, as
players raised Caper in the air
jubilantly as if he were the Paul
Bunyan Trophy himself.
And Dantonio's comments
about the importance of the
game-the Spartans' first back-
to-back wins against Michigan
since 1967 - seemed to elevate it
to instant-classic status.
"Amazingly - but facts are
facts - it hadn't been done for
42 years," Dantonio said. "We
did something today that hadn't
been done, and when you do
things like that, it has a way of
defining you."
But in a game where nearly
everything that has defined the
Wolverine offense failed them,
the only way the players could
define Saturday's game was
"disappointing."
"I'm not gonna talk," Michigan
linebackers coach Jay Hopson said
while walking to the team bus. "It
was atough one to swallow."

TIME OF POSSESSION
From Page 1B
possession can be a difficult sta-
tistic to interpret, but Michigan's
significant disadvantage high-
lighted the Wolverines' issues on
both sides of the ball.
Offensively, two of Michi-
gan's three first-half drives were
three-and-outs. And Michigan
State stopped the Wolverines
in three plays or less five times.
in the second half. Forcing the
Wolverines' defense, a unit that
is ranked ninth in the Big Ten,
to stay on the field for so long
exposed what is likely now-un-
ranked Michigan's biggest weak-
ness.
Ironically, Wolverine defen-
sive coordinator Greg Robinson,
who often wears a "3 & out" shirt
during practice, was known
for having strong third-down
defenses when he won two Super

- Bowls with the Denver Broncos
in the late 90's.
Michigan State converted on
a third-and-18 in the first half,
and on five more third-and-longs
during the rest of the game,
including the game-winning
touchdown when running back
Larry Caper took the ball outside
and shed a couple of tackles.
The Spartan offense was also
able to overcome three 15-yard
penalties on its first scoring
drive, and Spartan quarterback
Kirk Cousins tallied more rush
yards (19) than either of Michi-
gan's senior running backs on
just one second-and-25 play.
"It was the third downs that
killed us," Michigan coach Rich
Rodriguez said. "It was third and
longs, a lot of third and longs cost
us. I don't know how many times
the quarterback scrambled and
got first downs, and that's very
frustrating when you play two
good snaps and the third snap,
they get a big first down."

But it's hard to determine the
exact cause of everything that
went wrong. The Spartans, who
entered Saturday's game with
the worst possession time in the
Big Ten, extended drives and
held onto the ball 13 minutes lon-
ger than their previous average
- even with Michigan turning
in its second-best pass-defense
performance.
One of the factors? "Our
assignment was just wrong,"
according to senior Brandon
Graham.
"It's just not getting off the
field defensively and not staying
on the field offensively," Rodri-
guez said, visibly frustrated.
"I've always said we've got to
make the other team play some
defense, and in the first half, they
didn't have to play any defense.
They did, but they didn't have to
play for extended periods of time
because we weren't getting first
downs and we weren't stopping
them."

Blue gives up a
two-goal advantage
and ties in OT
By CAITLIN SMITH
For the Daily
The intensity during Yester-
day's game between the Michi-
gan women's soccer team and
Northwestern fluctuated just as
much asthe stormy weather, pro-
viding edge-of-your-seat action
for all spectators willing to brave
the elements.
After 110 minutes of play, the
Wolverines left with a 2-2 tie.
Michigan dominated most of
the play throughout the match,
but a 10-minute lapse in effort
seemed to be all the time that the
Wildcats needed to change the
end result.
Senior midfielder Amy Klip-
pert started off strong by scoring
just 16 minutes into regulation.
Sophomore midfielder Court-
ney Mercier set Klippert up for
a breakaway by chipping the ball
from midfield over the heads of
the Wildcat defense.
Klippert calmly finished the
ball past Northwestern's goal-
keeper into the middle of the
net, tallying her third goal of the
season and giving Michigan a 1-0
lead at the half.

Just minutes into the second
half of the game, Klippert was at
it again. With the ball at her feet,
Klippert stormed down the right
side of the field, and the referee
gave Klippert the advantage after
she was fouled near the end line.
Although she was tripped up, she
still came away with the ball and
looked to have a scoring oppor-
tunity.
Klippert dribbled across the
field and into the six-yard box,
where she passed the ball to
sophomore midfielder Meaghan
Hennessy. Hennessy blasted the
ball past the goalie to net her first
career goal.
"I saw Amy going down the
side and she played it in," Hen-
nessy said. "I thought that
Northwestern was going to get
it, but the defender whiffed the
ball and it was right in front of
me, so I took the shot. After I hit
it, I was just saying, 'Please go in
the goalt' After it went in, I was
shocked that it happened."
But, the 2-0 lead gave Michi-
gan (0-1-1 Big Ten, 5-6-1 over-
all) a little too much comfort in
their play. Just as the Wolverines
decided they could take it easy for
the rest ofthehalf, Northwestern
decided it was time to pick up the
intensity.
Just 30 seconds after Hen-
nessy's goal, the Wildcats slipped
the ball past the Michigan
defense and Northwestern's Sam

Greene was there to finish from
15 yards out.
Five minutes later, a North-
western (1-1-1, 5-6-2) free kick
was awarded near the middle of
the field. The Wildcats sent the
ball into the 18-yard box, caus-
ing a chaotic scramble. Wildcat
forward Jessica Palo found the
ball at her feet and kicked it into
the net over a sliding Michigan
defender.
Both teams fought aggressive-
ly to the end of regulation time
and couldn't finish during either
of the two sudden-death over-
time rounds.
Despite the inclement weath-
er, Michigan coach Greg Ryan
said he believes the team played
some of the best soccer they have
all year.
"I was really pleased," Ryan
said. "We possessed the ball bet-
ter, we connected better, we were
calmer."
Ryan also was proud of the
fact that the Wolverines scored
both of their goals in the run of
the play. Michigan is strong with
its set plays but has struggled
with finishing goals during live
action.
"This is only our third and
fourth goals in the run of play
(this season), so that is a big
improvement," Ryan said.
The Wolverines will next take
on Michigan State on Oct. 11lin
East Lansing.
