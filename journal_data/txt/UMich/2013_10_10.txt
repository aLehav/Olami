City Council approves
street closure in front
of Ingalls Mall
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
When the University's newest
fundraising campaign launches
in November, more than a little
celebratory glitz will be on hand
for its kickoff.
On Monday evening, the Ann
Arbor City Council voted to
approve the closure of North
University Avenue between
Fletcher and Thayer Streets for
the Victors for Michigan cam-
paign launch celebration on Nov.
8.
In September, the University
announced that an outdoor cel-
ebration on Ingalls Mall would
accompany the kickoff celebra-
tions. Following the event, Uni-
versity President Mary Sue
Coleman and campaign co-chair
Stephen Ross, a real-estate mogul
and major University donor, will
host the official "Victors for
Michigan" unveiling ceremony
at 8 p.m. inside Hill Auditorium.
Judy Malcolm, senior director
of executive communications at
the Office of University Devel-
opment, said the event is set to
occur in the area between Hill
Auditorium and the Michigan
League, adjacent to the Diag.

Beginning at 5 p.m., the Uni-
versity invites students, faculty
and community members to join
University donors and volunteers
for music, giveaways and free
T-shirts.
Later that evening, students
will share how their University
experience has been influenced
by student aid, essentially the
reasons "Michigan needs vic-
tors," as referenced by the cam-
paign's branding.
Along the lines of a public
launch party, campaign strat-
egists are hoping to involve
students in the campaign, espe-
cially since administrators have
pegged student aid as the cam-
paign's top priority.
Campaign officials have
formed a student advisory com-
mittee to assist in planning and
associated philanthropic efforts.
In a February interview with
The Michigan Daily, Coleman
said students articulAting the
effect of financial aid would be
crucial.
"We need to fashion this in a
way donors can get excited about
the difference they can make in
people's lives, so alot of this will
be storytelling about what stu-
dents have done and what the
impact of having various schol-
arships has been," Coleman said.

Egyptian authorities set
trial date for former leader

t

Hearing for former
Pres. Mohammed
Morsi set for Nov. 4
CAIRO (AP) - The politically
charged trial of Egypt's Moham-
med Morsi will begin Nov. 4,
almost four months to the day
after the country's first demo-
cratically elected president was
toppled by the military, authori-
ties said Wednesday.

The prosecution of Morsi on
charges of inciting his followers
to kill opponents of his rule takes
the crackdown on his Muslim
Brotherhood to a new level and
is likely to fuel protests by his
Islamist supporters, stoking the
turmoil shaking Egypt.
Since his July 3 ouster, Morsi's
backers have taken to the streets
in rallies met by a fierce response
by security forces that has left
hundreds dead.
Wednesday's announcement


comes as the United States
announced it was cutting hun-
dreds of millions of dollars in
annual aid to Egypt and its mili-
tary - a show of discontent with
the crackdown aimed at pres-
suring the interim leadership
to move quickly toward a demo-
cratically elected government.
For Egypt's military-backed
government, the trial is a chance
to lay out their justification
for the sweeping arrest cam-
paign and ultimately for Morsi's
ouster. Authorities contend the
former president and the Broth-
erhood, which dominated power
during his year in office, com-
mitted crimes while in power
- and have turned to violence
since his removal.
But the military, now Egypt's
dominant political power, also
opens itself up to criticism it is
carryingout show trials to crush
the Brotherhood, which accus-
es the army and its supporters
of wrecking Egypt's fledgling
democracy.
Already there are questions
whether the trial, in which
Morsi and 14 other members of
his Brotherhood are defendants,
can be fair.
Morsi has been held in secret
military detention since his
ouster, with almost no contact
with the outside world beyond
two phone calls with his fam-
ily. During his interrogation, his
defense lawyers have not been
allowed to talk to him and say
they have not been shown any
documentation of the prosecu-
tion's case.
"This is a trial held under
the cannon of a tank," said
Mohammed Gharib, a member
of Morsi's legal team. "Is this an
atmosphere for a fair trial?"
Morsi's son, Osama Morsi,
told the Turkish news agency
Anadolu that his father "rejects
this trial and others and will not
recognize it."
Rights lawyers point out
that they tried to have the case
prosecuted while Morsi was in
office, a sign that it is not purely
based on vengeance.

Saudi activistsh to debate
flfIng ban on women driving

'I

Official request
for rights made to
conservative ruling
council last week
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP)S
- Saudi women on the ultra-
conservative kingdom's top
advisory council have called
for a discussion on the sensi-
tive issue of allowing women
to drive, a move that could
embolden reformers pushing to
lift the ban.
The official request was
made this week to the head
of the Shura Council, council
member Latifa al-Shaalan said,
to address all "excuses" raised
to keep women from driving
since Islamic law and Saudi
traffic laws do not forbid it.
Women seeking the right to
drive in Saudi Arabia have been
energized by a campaign call-
ing on them to drive on Oct. 26.
Saudi law does not explicitly
prohibit them from driving, but
religious edicts by senior and
influential clerics are enforced
by the police, effectively ban-

ning it. Authorities do not issue
driving licenses to women.
The campaign started as
an online petition last month
and has so far garnered nearly
15,000 signatures.
In 2011, a Saudi woman was
detained for posting an online
video of herself driving, though
her arrest launched wider pro-
tests.
The country is guided by
an ultraconservative interpre-
tation of Islam called Wah-
habism. Women cannot travel,
work, study abroad, marry, get
divorced or gain admittance to
a public hospital without per-
mission from a male guardian
- typically a husband, brother,
father or uncle.
Hard-line clerics have
opposed the driving campaign
and recently a prominent Saudi
cleric caused a stir when he said
medical studies show that driv-
ing has adverse effects on wom-
en's ovaries because it forces the
pelvis upward.
Al-Shaalan, the Shura Coun-
cil member, told journalists that
the recommendation for the
discussion on women driving is
not meant to coincide with the

campaign and that it has been
studied for a while.
"It is flawed that a woman
cannot drive a car after reach-
ing the position of deputy min-
ister, becoming a member of
the Shura Council, managing a
university and representing the
country on international bod-
ies," she said.
She said it is also counterin-
tuitive to force a woman to ride
in a car with a male driver who
may be a stranger because it
contradicts the kingdom's strict
rules on separation of the sexes.
While the Shura Council
does not have legislative pow-
ers, the 30 women council
members made history this
year when they became the first
females appointed to the body.
The move by King Abdullah to
give women a voice on the body
was seen as part of a larger
reform effort by the monarchy.
In 2011, King Abdullah said
women can vote and run as
candidates in the 2015 munici-
pal elections. Last year, the
kingdom began enforcing a law
that allows women to work in
female apparel and lingerie
stores.

Snyder testifies
about Detroit
bankruptcy
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder
testified behind closed doors
Wednesday about his role tak-
ing Detroit into bankruptcy, a
rare interview with lawyers for
creditors who pressed him about
retiree pensions and asked if the
city could have done more to
avoid the historic filing.
Snyder waived executive
privilege and gave a three-hour
deposition at his office in Lan-
sing. The testimony can be used
as evidence in an upcoming trial
that will determine whether
Detroit is eligible to shed or
restructure at least $18 billion in
debt in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
Snyder, a Republican, didn't
speak to reporters but issued a
statement that repeated many of
his previous justifications for the
largest public bankruptcy in U.S.
history.

Schwertfeger did not say

Quebec seeks
to ban religious
symbols in public
Viewed from the outside,
Quebec often seems like a place
where all life orbits around the
political destiny of a French-
speaking province in an Eng-
lish-speaking country. The
latest instance centers on reli-
gious headwear.
The trigger is a heatedly
debated plan by the ruling party,
the separatist Parti Quebecois,
to make the provincial govern-
ment religion-neutral. It wants
to do so by banning symbols of
religious faith such as Jewish
skullcaps, Sikh turbans, Muslim
head scarves and large crucifixes
from public work places.
And as usual, the measure is
being read also for what it says
about the ruling party's peren-
nial goal of making Quebec inde-
pendent of the rest of Canada.
The analysis is that with support
for separatism weakened, and
an election being predicted for

December, something spectacu-
lar is needed to rally the party
base.
PARIS
Two reporters held
hostage in Syria
France has revealed the exis-
tence of two more journalists
taken hostage in Syria, after the
prime minister identified them in
a radio interview, apparently by
mistake.
The disclosure that Nicolas
Henin and Pierre Torres had been
kidnapped while working in Syria
June 22 brings to four the number
of French journalists known to be
held hostage in Syria.
The Foreign Ministry said
3 Wednesday that Henin and Tor-
res' capture was not disclosed
until now out of respect of their
families' wishes. However, in an
interview on French radio sta-
tion Europe 1 Wednesday morn-
ing, Prime Minister Jean-Marc
Ayrault named them for the first
time while answering a question
about two other reporters whose
kidnapping was disclosed in June.

Political drama
unfolds in Iran

Director General Ahmet Uzumcu of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, OPCW, gives an update
on the the chemical watchdog's verification and destruction mission in Syria during a press conference.
U.N. officials say rebels in.
Syria should seek ceasefIre

Inspectors need
access to destroy
chemical weapons
THE HAGUE, Netherlands
(AP) - International inspec-
tion teams overseeing the
destruction of Syria's chemical
weapons will have to negotiate
cease-fires between govern-
ment and rebel forces to gain
access to some sites, officials
closely involved with the mis-
sion said Wednesday.
The revelation is a clear
indication of the risks and dif-
ficulties of the unprecedented
disarmament plan, and it sug-
gests that the effort to rid
Damascus of its poison gas
stockpile may have a hard time
meeting its mid-2014 deadline.
The destruction of the stock-
pile is being led by a joint team
from the United Nations and the
Organization for the Prohibi-
tion of Chemical Weapons.
OPCW Director-General
Ahmet Uzumcu told report-

ers in The Hague the timeline
was tight but "not unrealistic."
He said inspectors have to visit
more than 20 sites in coming
days and weeks. Since the mis-
sion started last week, they have
been to one location; they are
expectedto inspect asecond site
near Damascus, the Syrian capi-
tal, on Wednesday.
This is the first time the glob-
al organization that polices the
Chemical Weapons Convention
has sent its inspectors and ana-
lytical chemists into a raging
civil war, and their security is
a major concern amid ongo-
ing fighting between President
Bashar Assad's forces and vari--
ous rebel groups. The war has
already left at least 100,000'
people dead.
On Wednesday, rebels over-
ran a military post near the
southern city of Daraa; accord-
ing to the Britain-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights
activist group. Opposition
fighters late last month also
captured a nearby military base
that previously served as the

customs office on the outskirts
of Daraa.
"If we can ensure some
cooperation by all parties and
if some temporary cease-fires
... can be established in order
to permit our experts to work
in a very hostile environment,
I think the targets could be
reached," Uzumcu said in his
first public remarks on the mis-
sion.
Previous attempts by inter-
national mediators to negoti-
ate broader cease-fires have
failed, though it might be easier
for combatants to agree to halt
their fire in a specific location
for a limited time.
Two large umbrella groups
for the Arab and Muslim world
- the Arab League and the
organization of Islamic Coop-
eration - are urging those
fighting in Syria to halt fighting
for the duration of next week's
four-day Muslim holiday of
Eid al-Adha, the Arab League's
deputy secretary general,
Ahmed Ben Heli, told reporters
in Cairo on Wednesday.

A cascade of events Wednes-
day suggested there was no
end in sight to the ideological
skirmishes following President
Hassan Rouhani's outreach to
the U.S.
Those overtures will be put
to the test next week in Geneva
when nuclear talks with world
powers resume.
For Rouhani, the immediate
prize would be winning pledg-
es from the West to roll back
painful sanctions in exchange
for concessions on Tehran's
nuclear program. But, on a
deeper level, Rouhani's gambit
also exposes sudden insecuri-
ties among the West-bashing
factions that have shaped Ira-
nian affairs for decades.

macy pays off in the eyes.
of Iran's top policymaker,
Supreme Leader . Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, it could bring
sharper limits on the reach of
powerful factions led by the
Revolutionary Guard - which
has already been warned by
Khamenei to stay out of politics
and let Rouhani's overtures run
their course.
The Guard will remain a
pillar of Iran's establishment
no matter what happens with
Rouhani's efforts. But Khame-
nei's directive to give Rouhani
political breathing room was
a rare roadblock for a group
whose power and influence

has expanded steadily in the
past decade. The Revolutionary
Guard's network now extends
beyond its fighting forces to
cover sectors as diverse as the
nuclear program and airport
security.
Possible attempts by Khame-
nei to separate the Guard from
the worlds of politics and for-
eign affairs would mark a pro-
found change on how Iran
interacts with the West, and
offer more of flexibility in
diplomacy.
"Opposition or frustration
by hard-liners is a natural
reaction," said Tehran-based
political analyst Saeed Leilaz.
"But nothing can derail Rou-
hani's policy of outreach to
the U.S." as long as Khamenei
remains nominally in his cor-
ner.
Khamenei has previously
said he's not opposed to direct
talks with the U.S. to resolve
Iran's nuclear standoff with
the West but is not optimistic.
Last week, he called the U.S.
"untrustworthy."
"There is a political will
to reduce tensions with the
U.S.," said a Tehran politi-
cal commentator, Hamid Reza
Shokoulli. "This strategy is sup-
ported by the supreme leader."
But that has not stopped crit-
ics of Rouhani's government
from making their complaints
heard.
The nationally broadcast Fri-
day prayers last week included
the familiar chants of "Death to
America." A week earlier, pro-
testers hurled eggs and insults
and Rouhani's entourage after
he returned from the ground-
breaking exchanges in New
York.
It was capped by President
Barrack Obama's phone con-
versation with Rouhani in the
highest-level dialogue between
the countries since Iran's 1979
Islamic Revolution.


Dutch apologize
for arresting
Russian diplomat

Start Your Career in Accounting.

Apology aimed
to smooth over,
diplomatic relations
THE HAGUE, Netherlands
(AP) - The Netherlands apolo-
gized to Russia on Wednesday
for the arrest and detention of
a Russian diplomat - but the
move appears unlikely to be
enough to ease growing ten-
sions between the two nations.
The swift apology by Foreign
Minister Frans Timmermans
aimed to smooth over a dip-
lomatic spat that has further
soured relations already tested
by Russia's seizure last month
of a Dutch-flagged Greenpeace
ship protesting oil drilling in
the Arctic. Russia has charged
all 30 people on board with
piracy, which carries a maxi-
mum 15-year sentence.
Diplomat Dmitry Borodin
was arrested Saturday by police
in The Hague over what Rus-
sian Foreign Ministry spokes-
man Alexander Lukashevich
called an "absolutely contrived"
allegation of child abuse.
His arrest breached the Vien-
na Convention on diplomatic
relations, Timmermans said in
a statement Wednesday. "The
Netherlands offers the Russian
Federation its apologies."
Still, the minister said he
understood the action of police
who arrested Borodin - a state-
ment unlikely to appease Rus-
sian demands for action against
the officers. The two nations
remain in talks about the situ-
ation.
Alexei Pushkov, chief of the
foreign affairs committee in the
lower house of Russia's parlia-
ment, wasn't satisfied.
"The Hague has offered us
its excuses, but it has effective-
ly sought to justify the police
action, calling it 'professional.'
So, there are excuses but there
is no one to blame," he tweeted..
Police have declined to com-
ment on the incident. Dutch

state broadcaster NOS report-
ed that police had traced a car
involved in an accident that
day to Borodin's home, and
neighbors told police they were
worried for the safety of the
children inside.
The Dutch-Russian spat
shifted to another topic
Wednesday as Russia ques-
tioned the quality of one of the
Netherlands' key exports -
cheese.,
The chief of Russia's agri-
culture products agency was
quoted by Russian news agen-
cies as saying a Russian del-
egation inspecting Dutch
cheese-making facilities was
not satisfied with the quality of
the product. Agency head Ser-
gei Dankvert said the results
were preliminary and a full
report would come later.
In Moscow, meanwhile,
Vladimir Markin, a spokesman
for the Investigative Commit-
tee dealing with the Greenpeace
incident, said investigators were
trying to identify the activists
whose inflatable boats tried to
block Russian coast guards. He
said they were "threatening life
and safety of an official." He also
said "dual use equipment" and
drugs were found on board the
Greenpeace boat that protested
Sept. 18 at a Gazprorn-owned
oil rig. Russian authorities have
seized the boat.
Greenpeace said "any claim
that illegal drugs were found is
a smear, it's a fabrication, pure
and simple."
The head of Greenpeace
International wrote to Rus-
sian President Vladimir Putin
requesting a meeting in Mos-
cow - and offering himself as
human bail for the detainees.
Kumi Naidoo of the Amster-
dam-based organization deliv-
ered the letter to the Russian
embassy in The Hague on
Wednesday. He said he would
guarantee the activists' good
conduct but said piracy charg-
es don't make sense and should
be dropped.

Recalculating route ***
New off-campus bus plan is a step in a safer direction
n Tuesday, students received an e-mail with the subject line
"BREAKING" from Central Student Government. It announced
an off-campus bus route in partnership with the Interfraterni-
ty Council. Starting in Winter 2014, the bus route will run from 10 p.m.
to 3 a.m. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. This bus route addresses an
under-discussed issue at the University: off-campus crime. It's certain-
ly one step toward addressing the problem, but at this point, its success
depends entirely on financial support from sponsors.

the condemning
shadow that's
still over Penn State, following the
Jerry Sandusky scandal and its pub-
licized fallout.
Two years later, Penn State has
made dramatic changes regarding
child safety and has begun the long
process of rebuilding its reputation.
But on a national level, have we
done enough to prevent these hei-
nous crimes?
In 2011, allegations of serial sexual
abuse by former Penn State assis-
tant football coach Jerry Sandusky
rocked the world of college athletics.
The abuse, followed by the institu-
tional cover-up andnegligence, led to
the firing of head coach Joe Paterno
and multiple school administrators.
The investigation grabbed national
headlines, tarnished the reputation
of the university and raised serious
questions about minors' safety and
institutional responsibility.
As the dust begins to settle, the
landscape around Penn State and
attention to minors' safety across
the nation has dramatically changed.
Sandusky was convicted and sen-
tenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.
Administrators associated with
the cover up are to stand trial for
obstruction of justice next spring.
Nineteen of the victims have reached
settlements and received checks
from the university. Penn State,

the settlements,has removedstatues,

has presented an oversimplification -Timothy Burroughs can be

According to CSG President Michael
Proppe, "84 percent of reported crimes took
place after 10 p.m., 67 percent took place off-
campus and 64 percent occurred in scenarios
in which the victim was walking." Introduc-
ing the new bus route is one step to potential-
ly reducing off-campus crime, but it will take
more effort on the University's part to make
sure students who live off-campus are safe.
CSG, however, should be commended for tak-
ing the initiative in finding and implementing
a way to protect students. The University will
be one of the first schools to start an off-cam-
pus bus route, and the student government
deserves the credit for finding new and inno-
vative ways to address crime.
Though the route is in itsbeginningstages,
it should be improved by adding additional
stops. The majority of the stops under the
current plan are concentrated in the Hill
area, leaving out a large number of students
living in South Campus and Kerrytown.

Moreover, the current bus route is only
scheduled to run on Thursday, Friday and
Saturday nights. That leaves four nights for
students to find alternative routes back home.
To extend late-night, off-campus bus routes
to cover the entire week and more areas of
campus, the administration should fund the
estimated $40,000 needed to expand service.
CSG and the IFC are taking proactive steps
to ensure campus safety, and now it's time for
the administration to match that effort.,
CSG should be commended for address-
ing issues that concern the safety of the stu-
dent body. With the relative prevalence of
off-campus crime, university administration
should've already initiated practical preven-
tion programs like the new bus route instead
of waiting for student leadership to take
action. It's not perfect - its limited route and
scope should be addressed, but now it's up to
the University to support the 30,000 students
that live off-campus.

(Un)equal opportunity

NOTABLE QUOTABLE
I've never done twerking in my life, and
I don't intend to take it up."
- U.S. House Representative Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) said Wednesday in response to Miley Cyrus'
government shutdown parody on Saturday Night Live.
AIMAN FARUQI j EJWPOIN
Government taken hostage

"All men are created equal" - and even
today are still worth more than women.
The Declaration of Independence and
subsequent ideological foundations of Amer-
ica aided in forming our patriarchal society
where women are still systemically depreci-
ated. This is perhaps best exemplified in the
workplace. We have to work extra hard to
overturn antiquated gender notions. What's
our reward? Equal work for unequal pay.
Sound like the American Dream? Not quite.
The Equal Pay Act of 1963 helped amelio-
rate some of the discrimination women faced
by making it illegal to use gender as a basis for
higher salary. From the 1960s to 2011, women
have gone from earning on average less than
60 percent (58 cents per dollar) of what men
were making to roughly 77 percent (77 cents
per dollar, for full-time, white women) for the
same work. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act
of 2009 amended this original act by allowing'
women to file lawsuits against unequal pay up
to 180 days after their most recent paycheck,
instead upon first recognition of the injustice
- as was previously held by law.
Despite the progression, Lilly Ledbetter,
the woman for whom the law was named,
admits that women are still pushed into the
gender gap. Why?
For starters, there are several loopholes
in our current legislation regarding working
women. Currently, if I have an inclination that
my male counterpart is earning more than Iam
for analogous work, what can I do about it? In
this uncertain economy, should I risk my job in
attempt to find out the truth? That's an option,
but not a very fair or logical one.
Secondly, there's a mass infiltration of
fabricated explanations regarding the truth
behind why women are making less than
men. These notions are nothing new and
much of what the feminist movement sought
'to reform. Still, there's a widely held belief,
even among women, that our pay gap is a
result of our choices - choices like working
less and seeking more pink-collar jobs.
While some women may in fact clock in
fewer hours than men and pursue lower-
paying jobs, it's undeniable that these factors
inaccurately account for the entirety of wage
discrimination. Even CONSAD, a consulting
company contracted by the Department of

Labor, admitted a S to 7 percent difference
in men's salaries after controlling for those
extraneous variables. In the land of equal
opportunity,'the findings don't look so egali-
tarian to me.
What we need is a more robust solution.
And that could be The Paycheck Fairness Act.
Self-proclaimed "equity feminist," Christina
Hoff Sommers hits on these interrelated points
in many of her published works, namely her
bluntly titled piece, "The Case Against the Pay-
check Fairness Act." Here, she claims the bill as
something for "aggrieved" women and justifies
higher salaries for typically male-dominated
fields. She goes on to remark that business
school professors should earn more than those
in social work due to market demand.
Besides sounding like many males that
benefit from this current system, I don't think
she fully understands what she fights against.
In fact, research now suggests that within
universities, mission drift and permeating
implicit sexism account for some of the wage
gap. Within similar academic titles, women
are generally rewarded less for research
outcomes, spend more time on teaching and
have larger workloads than men, in addition
to greater service expectations. What does
Sommers have to say about that?
The Paycheck Fairness Act could require
companies to be more public with adminis-
tered wages, thus increasing awareness to
any inequality among employees. The act
has been so close, yet so far, from passing the
Senate. Could it be because female senatorial
presence is scarce? Perhaps.
But like Sommers, many women actu-
ally believe this act isn't necessary, and even
further, not progressive. The majority of the
Democratic Party is in support of the act, but
there are Republicans that are pulling back.
Female Republican legislators and female
Republican voters are allowing political affil-
iation to trump gender empowerment. Is this
the price we want to pay?
It's time that we women band together
to advocate for the American Dream - and
the Paycheck Fairness, Act. We're worth
fighting for.

With impasse in Congress lead-
ing to a governnient shutdown, the
American people are asking whether
their representatives are capable
of fulfilling their public obligation.
Conventional wisdom in American
politics has attributed the blame
equally to both parties in times of
political divide. But is this actually
a fair assessment? An honest look
at the situation at hand shows that
this is not the case. The Republicans
in Congress have shown a level of
intransigence that is unparalleled in
the Democratic Party's stratagem.
This intransigence can be rooted
back to the election of President
Barack Obama in 2008. After the
Republicans suffered devastat-
ing losses in the elections - losing
control of the presidency and both
houses of Congress - key figures in
the party regrouped to formulate a
strategy to maintain their political
influence and regain control in 2012.
Among the 15 interlocutors were
representatives Paul Ryan and Eric
Cantor and senators Jim DeMint
and Tom Coburn, along with former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich. They
met before the president's inaugura-
tion for one purpose only: to scheme
against Obama's policy initiatives.
Gingrich's final words to his fellow
Republicans were: "You will remem-
ber this day. You'll remember this as
the day the seeds of2012 were sown."
Later, in 2010, Sen. Mitch McCo-
nnell of Kentucky reaffirmed the
true purpose of Congressional
Republicans in one of the most can-
did political statements of the past
few years: "The single most impor-
tant thing we (Republicans) want to
achieve is for President Obama to be
a one-term president."
This goal - to hurt the president

- played itself out over the course of
the next few years: The Republicans
blocked the president's executive
appointments, most recently seen
with the Defense Secretary Chuck
Hagel and Susan Rice, and unani-
mously rejected proposed legislation,
the earliest example being the stimu-
lus package.
Of course, resistance from the
opposition party along ideologi-
cal divides is completely expected;
it's quite believable that Democrats
held similar meetings after the 2000
and 2004 presidential elections. But
the level of obstructionism demon-
strated by the Republicans over the
past few years simply cannot be com-
pared to dissent by the Democrats
during the Bush presidency.
The Iraq War, for instance, was
supported by some liberals, and
Democrats in Congress. This isn't to
say that Democrats have a spotless
track record of governance; their
party's issues are numerous and
large, but they aren't the same as
those the Republican Party exhibits.
When we consider all of this
evidence, it's hard to say that the
Republicans have any intention of
"compromising" with the president.
They had no intention of compro-
mising when key figures from their
party conspired against progress,
and they certainly don't have the
intention of compromising now. But
that begs the question: What is the
track record of Democrats on com-
promising to the Republicans?
Actually, it's quite good - so good
that it has become one of the biggest
weaknesses of the Democratic Party.
In2009,theDemocratscavedintothe
Republican demand to leave out the
public option in Obama's health-care
bill, despite the fact that Obama's bill

with a public option would have been
the compromise. The current state of
the Affordable Care Act is not what
liberals desired; that's a single-payer
health-care system. The Affordable
Care Act in its current form is a bill
most Republicans supported just two
decades ago.
By giving into the Republican's
unreasonable demands time and
time again, the president and his
party have set a dangerous prec-
edent of negotiations - a precedent
that Republicans have completely
incorporated into their political
strategy. Their version of a compro-
mise now is 90 percent of what they
want and 10 percent of what every-
one else wants.
And now, when we assess our
current situation with the govern-
ment shutdown, the Republicans'
demands seem even more absurd.
They want to defund a healthcare
law that Republicans once favored.
Add to this the reaffirmation of the
Affordable Care Act in the 2012
elections and the adjudication of
the law by the U.S. Supreme Court,
and you have a Republican party
that has completely lost its mind.
They don't want to negotiate: They
want to take the government hos-
tage. They have decided that if they
cannot change policy by winning
elections, then they will change
policy by throwing tantrums.
The sooner the American elec-
torate realizes that the bulk our
political standstills have stemmed
from an opposition party that's
more concerned with beating the
president than making progress,
the sooner we can restore the our
democracy's integrity.

LSA senior Chloe Brown,

"Michigan has this huge

the way that they market them-
selves," Brown said. "But when
you get here it's completely dif-

ferent. If you're going to pay
however much money to go here,
you should feel safe here."
The event drew mostly
intrigued or confused reactions
from the rest of the student body,
who found themselves walking
around a large circle of protes-

strong, in order to reach their
classes.
"I'vebeengettingalotofques-

ACLU files complaint against
Border Patrol officers in Ariz.

Group claims agents
used excessive force
against migrants
PHOENIX (AP) - Border
Patrol agents in southernArizo-
na are subjecting U.S. citizens to
illegal searches, detentions and
excessive force in many cases
miles from the state's border
with Mexico, the American
Civil Liberties Union wrote ina
complaint Wednesday.
The group is seeking a fed-
eral probe into what it calls
"widespread and longstand-
ing" constitutional abuses,
and in'a letter to the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security's
Office of Inspector General, the
ACLU cites five cases in which
it says citizens were wrongful-
ly detained without probable
cause, among numerous other
violations.
The group wants an inves-
tigation into the individual
complaints as well as a compre-
hensive review of Border Patrol
policies.
DHS has declined comment
on the complaint that comes
two weeks after the federal

government settled an ACLU
lawsuit over similar allegations
in Washington state.
While admitting no wrong-
doing in that case, the Bor-
der Patrol agreed to retrain
agents and share with advocacy
groups records of every traffic
stop its agents make in Wash-
ington's Olympic Peninsula
along the northern border with
Canada for 18 months, among
other things.
. The ACLU says the issue of
constitutional violations by
Border Patrol agents dates back
decades and continues to be
ignored by federal authorities.
"It has a huge impact on bor-
der communities, but it extends
far into the interior," said ACLU
attorney James Lyall. "Border
Patrol claims broad authority
anywhere within 100 miles of
any external boundary."
Lyall said that covers two-
thirds of the U.S. population.
"The potential for abuses
is not constrained to just the
border regions but really can
impact the majority of Ameri-
cans," he added, noting a for-
mal lawsuit may follow the
complaint.
The National Border Patrol

Council, the union for agents,
balked at the allegations as
being widespread.
"People are going to make
mistakes, but I think those are
very few and far between," said
Shawn Moran, the group's vice
president.
He said the union has sought
more transparency from DHS
regarding complaints and
assaults against agents, noting
it would help the public better
understand the dangers of the
job.
"Transparency would really
show that our agents do a good
job, and of course we're always
for more training," Moran said.
"But we're not in favor of train-
ing that is just thrown on top of
us to appease a special interest
group."
ACLU's complaint also
comes three weeks after the
completion of a review by DHS's
Office of Inspector General into
allegations of excessive force by
Border Patrol agents.
The report recommended
improvements in training but
contained little discussion of
use-of-force policies and cited
no specific wrongdoing by the
agency.

WASHINGTON (AP) -
House Republican leaders
are considering a short-term
increase in the U.S. debt limit
as a possible way to break the
gridlock that threatens, the
nation with an unprecedented
default in as little as a week,
officials' said Wednesday
night.
These officials said there
is far less urgency inside the
leadership about ending the
current nine-day partial gov-
ernment shutdown, which
has caused inconvenience and
financial concern for many
individual Americans but
appears not to threaten the
widespread economic damage
a default might bring.
The officials declined to say
what conditions, if any, might
be attached to legislation to
raise the $16.7 trillion debt
limit for an undetermined
period, perhaps a few weeks or
months. The GOP rank and file
is expected to meet privately
to discuss the issue on Thurs-

Speaker John Boehner goes to

"There is more awareness that
holy areas have to be watched
closer and protected better,"
Rosenfeld said.
The Rev. Pierbattista Pizza-
balla, one of the Roman Catho-
lic church's top officials in the
Holy Land, said such attacks
"have become routine and tar-

But it's also true that they're

Naoum, the cemetery care-

religious figures will be paying a
solidarity visit to the cemetery
this week.
In the oldest section of the
Protestant Cemetery of Mount
Zion, just outside the walls of
Jerusalem's ancient Old City, the
tops of large stone monuments,
many written in German, were

Morsi trial date stokes political
drama in Egypt following force-out

Prosecution charges
Pres. incited followers
to kill opponents
BUENOS AIRES, Argen-
tina (AP) - The doctors who
removed a blood clot from the
brain of Argentina's president
said Wednesday that she's
improving "without complica-
tions." But their terse report
gave no information suggesting
how long the government will
be without its charismatic lead-
er in charge.
Their three-sentence report
said Cristina Fernandez's vital
signs were "normal" and her
spirits "very good." It said the
60-year-old leader would begin
eating later Wednesday.
Her spokesman, Alfredo Scoc-
cimarro, appeared briefly before
a crowd outside the hospital to
announce the doctors' report,
adding'only that the president
had slept well and "sends a big
kiss to all the Argentines."
And that was it. The only
government official authorized
to release details about Fernan-
dez's condition left without tak-
ing questions.
The lack of details frustrated
Argentines such as Fernando
Ballester, a 40-year-old office
administrator. "She has the
obligation to inform us. The
president's health is a matter of
state," he said.
"The country can't function
without Cristina," he said. "Our
political system is focused on
the presidency, and especially

the president we have now, who
makes all the decisions."
Laboratory worker Silvina
Caceres agreed: "It's not OK
that the president of the repub-
lic doesn't keep the people
informed about her health. Her
life is not private ... If not, all
she feeds to the people is para-
noia."
Caceres was among many
who are convinced Fernandez
will keep working behind the
scenes. "She keeps governing
from the clinic," Caceres said.
Even Vice President Amado
Boudou, nominally in charge of
the executive branch while Fer-
nandez recuperates, suggested
as much on Tuesday, the day
of her surgery. He declared in
a speech that "to Cristina, her
country is more important than
her own health!"
Brain surgeons not involved
in Fernandez's surgery consult-
ed by The Associated Press said
there was no reason to think that
the surgery could have lasting
complications, but they said the
risks would increase if she tried
to go back to work too soon.
They also differed widely on
how long such patients generally
need to recuperate - the Argen-
tines consulted said she could
be out from 30 to even 90 days,
while U.S. experts said she could
be back to work in a week.
A member of the surgical
team, Dr. Pablo Rubino, sug-
gested Wednesday that Argen-
tines have little need to worry.
"Once she's completely recov-
ered, there won't be any prob-
lem. She'll be able to do any sort

of activity," he said.
But Rubino, the chief of vas-
cular surgery at the Fundacion
Favaloro, where Fernandez
remained in intensive therapy,
stressed that confidential:
ity vows prevented her doctors
from saying how long she might
need to recover.
"We can't enter into details,
but the information was abso-
lutely faithful. The com-
munications are absolutely
accurate," Rubino said. Pressed
by a government radio host to
say whether Fernandez could
be out for a month, he said,
"Some need less, some need
more."
Argentina's looming chal-
lenges include the Oct. 27 con-
gressional elections, in which
the ruling party now lacks its
top campaigner. Another devas-
tating loan default became more
likely this week when the U.S.
Supreme Court rejected Argen-
tina's initial appeal in its debt
fight. The economy has slowed,
the currency is losing value and
inflation is soaring.
Ruling party lawmakers were
making the best of it, debating
the 2014 budget Wednesday. But
many had questioned Boudou's
leadership because of the cor-
ruption investigations he faces,
and the presidency didn't make
public the formal -transfer-of-
power document that usually
indicate how long a president
would need to be replaced.
"It's like we're on stand-by,"
Caceres said. "Nothing impor-
tant is going to happen until she
takes the reins again."

Storied programs
face off in opener

Joey Burzynski watched the ,
* first Michigan football game of
his career like the rest of us, star-
ing down at Denard Robinson,
Mike Martin and Jonas Mouton
from high up in the stands. That
was Saturday, September 4,2010.
On Monday, Sept. 6 of that
year, Burzynski was at a walk-on
tryout. It lasted an hour and fol-
lowed the team practice. Noth-
ingtoo strenuous,justsome work
with the bags and pass protec-
tion drills.
On Tuesday, a list was posted
outside the field house. Burzyn-
ski's name was on it, and just like
that, he was practicing for the Redshirt junior guard Joey Burzynski i
Michigan football team, shaking
Robinson's hand as a teammate
instead of a fan.
In his first meeting, Burzyn-
ski wore full pads. Director of
Player Personnel Chris Single-
tary looked at him and said, "Full
pads?You excited?"
Burzynski smiled and said,
"Yeah, I'm excited!"
Singletary looked at Burzyn-
ski, then looked over at Martin,
who is now a defensive tackle for
the Tennessee Titans. Talking to
Martin, Singletary said, "Did you
hear that Mike? He's ready for
pads!"
A "All I could say was, 'Oh, dear,

ski said recently after practice.

When the Michigan hockey
team hosts No. 4 Boston Col-
lege on Thursday, the two most
successful programs in college
hockey will already know each
other better than you'd expect.
Two seniors, defenseman Mac
Bennett and forward Derek DeB-
lois, grew up just 75 miles away
from Boston College. Bennetthas
played with or against the major-
ity of the Eagles' roster in youth
games and national team tryouts.
DeBlois's two sisters and his
mother attended Boston College.
"I converted them to Michigan
fans," DeBlois said.
His family will be in town for

ing with (defenseman Nolan)
de Jong, and I love playing with
him," Bennett said. "He's a really
smart player, and he's going to
be a guy we're probably going to
look to."
De Jong led the team with
five shots in an exhibition loss to
Waterloo (Ont.) this past Sunday.
Fellow freshmen defensemen
Michael Downing and Kevin
Lohan also look to heavily con-
tribute on an inexperienced blue
line.
But the upcoming test against
the Eagles will be a demand-
ing one. Boston College returns

High school. There's no one there
to push them.'
Not for Burzynski. He didn't
have any guarantees but was still
working outlike he was a return-
ing All-American.
After he made the team, it
would have been easyto get com-
placent. Burzynski was just 260
pounds and getting demolished
on the scout team by Martin. All
he could think about was trying
not to embarrass himself on the
scout team, much less trying to
get on the field.
"I would have to wake up
early, work out, go to practice
and just get wrecked," he said.
I would hit (Martin) and say, 'I
don't know what I'm supposed
to do.' He didn't move and could
pick me up with one arm."
But in between engineering
lectures on North Campus and
summer internships with start-
ups, Burzynski kept working.
He's played in 13 career games
and is the primary backup for
both guard positions.
"I never underestimate the
ability of a kid that's smart
enough to know that if he thinks
he can do it, he will do it," McAl-
lister said. "There might be guys

that are more talented physically,
but there's not a kid who is going
to give you more effort, heart
and passion than Joey. Those
guys figure out a way to get on
the field."
At Michigan, Burzynski is
in an honors program called
Engineering Global Leadership,
which combines his major with
business and international stud-
ies classes. The end goal is to be
in product design while doing
research on the side.'
That's what he came to Michi-
gan for. That's why he's here, not
for football.
But he's still got another year
of eligibility after this season,
another brick in the road of the
biomedical engineer turned
offensive lineman.
"It never ceases to surprise
and amaze me what he's done,"
McAllister said. "It's a lesson
for anyone, that if they work
hard enough they can create an
opportunity for themselves to be
successful. He's definitely done
that for himself, and he's earned
everything that's come his way.
I know he'll do anything on the
field or off the field to make sure

University alumni Noel Gordon and Zesheng Chen
attended the same party their freshman year, but had
drastically different experiences. Gordon, a former col-
umnist for The Michigan Daily, experienced a racially
charged confrontation with another partygoer, while
Chen had the time of his life. Still, for both men, the
party helped them realize how their racial identities
couldn't be separated from their identities as queer. Not
long after, during the winter semester of 2012, Gordon
and Chen founded the Coalition for Queer People of
Color.
That story is how LSA seniors Alex Ngo and Ozi
Uduma recounted the formation of the Coalition for
Queer People of Color. Ngo and Uduma serve as two
of the three current co-chairs of the Coalition, and
explained how Gordon and Chen recognized the ways
other student organizations weren't always welcoming
to queer students of color.
"I think generally they just found that, in the spaces
where they were supposed to feel comfortable and sup-
posed to feel the most themselves, they still felt this
kind of conflict happening where they maybe had to
put their sexual orientation up front first and kind of
leave their racial identity to the back burner in order to
fit in," Ngo said. "The Coalition came about as a way to
fill that need."
No such thing as a single-issue struggle
When Ngotried to be a part of Asian spaces and com-
munities on campus, he confronted an obstacle. As a
queer Asian, he wasn't always welcome in these groups,

which were unified through their racial identities-but
didn't really allow Ngo to also bring his queer identity
to the table. Sometimes the Asian students around him
would even say homophobic remarks, leading him to
consider whether he should hide his queer identity.
Uduma, a Martha Cook Diversity Peer Educator and
the daughter of Nigerian immigrants, explained that
spaces for people of color on campus sometimes carry
a fear or uneasiness about confronting and discuss-
ing sexuality. Their third co-chair, LSA senior Ramiro
Alvarez Cabriales, agreed and spoke specifically in
terms of the Latin@ community on campus.
"I think the biggest scapegoat when interacting
in predominantly Latin@ student of color spaces is
that it is in our culture to be hyper-masculine or that
it is inherently in our culture to be heteronormative,"
Cabriales said. "Those spaces can be very homophobic."
Not only do the clubs for students of particular racial
or ethnic identities not always welcome queer people,
but some of the predominantly white LGBTQ groups on
campus also have a disconnect when it comes to race.
Cabriales and Uduma both expressed their frustra-
tion with the "gay is the new black" rhetoric that some
LGBTQ organizations have adopted.
"What if you're both?" Cabriales asked.
When LGBTQ organizations try to equate racial
oppression to oppression based on sexuality, they
ignore and marginalize queer people of color. Cabriales
and Ngo's racial identities can't be separated from their
queerness, and yet in some spaces, they were made to
feel like they should prioritize one over the other.
"Tokenizing happens a lot - fetishizing, exotifi-

cation of black and brown bodies," Cabriales said of.
predominantly white LGBTQ spaces. "It's made very
evident that we are different in queer spaces. It's made
very evident that either we are unwelcome or obsessed
over in this weird 'I want to hook up with a brown boy'
kind of way."
These queer spaces on campus often reflect the agen-
da of the mainstream LGBTQ movement, which simi-
larly doesn't speak for or include queer people of color.
The mainstream movement is currently very focused
on marriage equality and the rights attached to mar-
riage, and this priority doesn't necessarily always reso-
nate with communities of color.
"I used to be undocumented, and most of my fam-
ily continues to be undocumented," Cabriales said. "I
feel like I'm wasting my time to continue to talk about
marriage when there are queer people who are undocu-
mented. Marriage isn't evena possibility for them."
"My parents are straight and don't even have health
insurance," Cabriales said, emphasizing how the fight
for marriage equality sometimes ignores broader social
justice issues.
"I experience homosexuality in a very different way
because of the way my family is structured," Cabria-
les said. "I experience it in more than one language, in
more than one country, and white Americans don't get
that. They don't get that sometimes you have to come
out in English, sometimes in Spanish. You have to find
words for both, because no one is taught the words to
come out ever because you're presumed to be straight
from birth."

In defense of Chris
Brown s career

NETFLIX PIX
Daily Arts Writers dig through recent
Netflix releases to find the films worth
revisiting or discovering.

By LENA FINKEL
Daily Gossip Columnist
It's no secret that 90 percent
of what comes out of Chris
Brown's mouth is completely
idiotic. Every time someone
utters his name, my first
thought is always, "What did
he say this time?" Honestly,
his agent should just tell him
to shut the fuck up already
and stop picking up the phone
when the press rings.
Most recently, Chris com-
plained about his additional
1,000 community service
hours being a "bitch" (he even
claimed the District Attorney
had racial bias), and bragged
about losing his virginity at
the ripe age of 8.
Seriously, he told The
Guardian UK, "At 8, being able
to do it kind of preps you for
the long run, so you can be
beast at it."
Truly inspiring, that boy.
But despite the numerous
Chris Brown scandals over
the years, and his misogyny in
general, I still listen to some
of his music. To clarify, this
means I have exactly one Chris
Brown song on my iPod and
have seen a few of his music
videos. In the grand scheme of
things, this isn't a crime.
Yet, after telling one of
my roommates that I liked
Brown's new song, "Love
More," he looked at me and
said, "It always really surpris-
es me when girls say they like
Chris Brown."
As if to say, as a woman, it
was my responsibility to throw
a hissy fit about every single
sexist thing in our culture. As
if to say, that as a man, it was

"Fargo"
Originally released in 1996, this Coen Brothers
police drama has since become recognized as one
of the duo's most relevant works. Not only does it
bend the traditional rules of a typical police proce-
dural by humoring and humanizing its subjects, it
does so through the eyes of perhaps the brothers'
most unique character to date: the very cunning,
extremely willful and extraordinarily pregnant
Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDor-
mand). Even if you're not that into the Coen Broth-
ers, cops-and-robbers or movies in general, check
out "Fargo" for that iconic central performance by
McDormand. It'll stick with you.

"King of New York"
This is not a very good film. It's boring, cliched
and probably the most run-down regurgitation of
the crime boss genre until someone does a take-
by-take remake of the "Godfather," but I'm not
ashamed to say I've watched it three times. Why?
Christopher Walken, Walken, without hyperboliz-
ing, is this movie. His lines are never really spe-
cial, but seem quotable in real time only because
they're being said with perfect Walken inflection.h
If you, like any sane person, have an excuse to
brush up on your Walken impression, this is the
movie to watch. Also, Gus from "Breaking Bad" is
in it. SOOO...

"Confessions of a
Dangerous Mind"
George Clooney is a lot of things. Handsome,
charming, dat'smile, basically a physicalincarnation
of Danny Ocean from the "Ocean's" trilogy. Except,
of course, he's not a thief. He's a filmmaker. And in
every sense of the word, he's a master of his craft.
So do yourself a favor and check out his directorial
debut, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"boasting
a powerhouse leading performance by Sam Rock-
well as Chuck Barris, the successful game show host
who claimed to live a double life as a CIA assassin.
It's a long movie that requires close attention, but
as is habitual to anything produced by GCloons, the
effort is more than worth it. Rather than your cut-
and-dry biopic, what we get is a film that blurs the
line between sanity and fiction. It's a trippy ride, but
you'll be glad you took it.

"As Good as
It Gets"
"As Good as It Gets" is about a man pitted
against his OCD and dyspeptic prejudices - all
of which he has to overcome to win the love of
a waitress. Melvin Udall is, of course, played
by Jack Nicholson in an Oscar-winning perfor-
mance and Carolyn Connelly by Helen Hunt,
who also grabbed an Oscar. Ultimately, it's the
film's romantic gestures that lend it a sweet
quality, and it's the pragmatic hardships both
characters face each day therein portrayed
that make it a statement about courage and
redemption and love's relation to both. The
film excels in lending voice to the little things
that are so often left unsaid. In the purity of
Melvin's profession of love, "You make me
wanna be a better man."

RADICAL LOVE
From Page 1B
According to Cabriales, the
mainstream gay agenda often
entails fighting around one identi-
ty, which he doesn't feel is the right
approach. He recalled the words of
Caribbean-American feminist and
civil, rights activist Audre Lorde:
"There is no such thing as a single-
issue struggle because we do not
live single-issue lives."
"We are not single-issue peo-
ple," Cabriales added.
This realization of a need for a
space where queer people of color
wouldn't have to prioritize one
identity over another helped bring
Ngo, Uduma and Cabriales to the
Coalition.
Ngo was first introduced to
the Coalition after participating
in the rXs intragroup dialogue, a
program that preceded the Coali-
tion for Queer People of Color
and is now run through the Coali-
tion. Launched in fall 2011, rXs is a
semester-long dialogue program
for LGBTQ people of color that,like
the Coalition, seeks to create a safe
space for queer and trans* people
of color to share their lived experi-
ences and connect with others.
"I had just come out, so I was so
focused on my sexual orientation
and so focused on gettinggay males
to accept me," Ngo said. Whel
Coalition founders Gordon and
Chen approached him about join-
ing the RxS dialogue, he was "very
apprehensive and even scared."
"But going through the process
really changed my whole out-
look on identities and reinforced
to me that I didn't have to, and I
shouldn't have to, pick one or the
other," Ngo said. "I should be able
to live my life fully, recognizing all
of myidentities."

activism and radical social move-
ments, Ann Arbor and the Univer-
sity's campus are often assumed
to be a bubble of tolerance and
acceptance. As Uduma and Ngo
explained, that can be a problem-
atic and blinding approach to how
we view the campus.
"I think it paralyzes people into
thinking that they have this check-
list," Ngo said "As long as they
check off 'OK, I'm a liberal; OK, I
have a diverse group of friends; OK,
I treat everyone equally,' they think
they can walk around and just feel
good about themselves. I think
that's actually a boundary for them
to actually go deeper and delve into
the biases that we all have."
Uduma agreed, but also recog-
nized that there are some people
who come to Ann Arbor who feel
the safest they've ever felt. "For
some," she said, "Ann Arbor is the
place where they feel safest to be
themselves."
"I can attest to that," Ngo inter-
jected.
"But for others, a lot of us feel
stifled here," Uduma continued.
"It's a liberalism without being
conscious about what's going on
and without being critical about
what's going on."
Part of that disconnect comes
fromthe fact that some feelthe Uni-
versity itself has many shortcom-
ings when it comes to answering
the needs of queer students of color.
"In my experience, all the
departments at the University have

this message of wanting diversity,"
Ngo said. "I feel like it's a lot of lip
service, saying that they're. inclu-
sive and saying that they have a lot

The Coalition collaborates with other groups and co-sponsored an event celebrating Latin@ culture on campus on Oc

ofdiversitybuthavingno actionfor
how to really implement and how
to really be trueto their word."
Uduma reiterated that the Uni-
versity has to put more action
behind the dialogue on diversity.
"There's such a focus on num-
bers and increasing the numbers
for diversity, but there's noth-
ing about sustaining the students
that you already have," she said.
"What happens when you have
this increase, and you don't know
.what to do with these students?
They're still goingto face the same
problems that you're not willingto
change structurally or implement
more programs beyond just talk-
ing aboutit."
"It has way more to do than
just programming," Ngo added.
"If the staff in your department
is all white, why aren't you talk-
ing about that? Are you trying to
recruit more people of color and
more queer people of colorto really
serve the students? Are these stu-
dents even a priority in the first
place? So I think just structurally,
those are issues I've seen on cam-
pus. You can say that you want
diversity, but where is the dedica-
tion? Where is the actual action?"
One of the most visible resourc-
es and spaces for multi-cultural
students on campus is the Trot-
ter Multicultural Center, which
originally opened in 1971 as a black
student cultural center, but was
expanded to become an inclusive
student multicultural center in
1981. The Trotter House, while
providing useful programs and'
resources to students of color, has
its downfalls.
"It's falling apart," Uduma said.
"That place is not sustainable."
The Trotter House also doesn't
necessarily provide a safe space
for queer students of color, as the
building is located near frater-
nity houses. Fraternities, as Ngo
explained, are not always safe
spaces for queer people.
When asked about where the
Coalition sees a need for reform at
the University level, Ngo echoed
Cabriales's belief in a plurality of
issues.
"There's not necessarily a
queer-person-of-color issue," Ngo
said. "All issues are geer issues.
Because we haveto get healthcare,
too; we have to be in these classes;
we might have to go to SAPAC; we
also have to go to UHS. We need to
make sure these departments real-
ize that queer students are on this
campus, and they need to tailor
their services for us, and people of
color, and the intersection of both."
Creating safe spaces

creating a community and safe
space for people to be themselves
and love themselves. This year's
theme for the Coalition is "Radi-
cal Love." Ngo said the Coali-
tion's core has been grappling
with a critical question this year:
"What's the point of expending all
of this energy on the University or
sources that don't care about us, on
trying to convince people to care
about us when they don't and they
never will?"
The Coalition answered by tak-
ing an inward look and deciding to
channel its energy into fostering
a community where queer people
of color can feel safe, affirmed
and empowered. It accomplishes
this through events like Coalition
T(ea), a weekly eventhosted bythe
Coalition that allows queer people
ofcolor to talk about their personal
lives as well as current events and
news on campus and beyond.
"We're tryingto focus our ener-
gy on really loving ourselves, each
other, on creating a space where
we can be us and not apologize
for it," Ngo said. "And from there,
people will have a stronger foun-
dation to go out and radically love
ourselves in front of other people."
"We've given that space to peo-
ple to say you are special; you are
good enough; you are beautiful
enough," Uduma said. "You get to
define who you are in this space,
and I think that's radical in and of
itself. Because we allow people to
be who they are in a world that tells
them they can't be who they are."
Ngo quoted feminist person
of color Kim Karin Crosby, who
changed his life at the Coalition's
"Color of Change" conference
last year, saying: "Our most radi-
cal work is to love ourselves." To
Ngo, creating spaces for people to
love themselves and not be sorry
for who they are is what the Coali-
tion is all about. It might not look
like what people generally think
of as activism, but creating com-
munity and safe spaces can change
people's lives and how they view
themselves.
"In that one moment, I can
be who I am around people who
aren't going to judge me, who are
going to understand," Uduma
said of the Coalition community.
"Then, I can go back into the world
a little bit stronger and feel a little
better about myself. And feel like
I can sustain myself for as long as
I need to until I come back to this
space with these people and get
more of that."
Cabriales described one of the
first events the Coalition orga-
nized. Called Family Barbeque,the
logistics of the event were simple:
a gathering of peers for a meal and
conversation. However, the event
was only open to queer people of
color. Family Barbeque immedi-

ately created a buzz, some of it in
opposition from white or straight-
identifying people who were
excluded from the event. But the
other reaction was one of intense
revelation: Many attendees had
never been in a room surrounded
entirely by queer people of color.
Creating a community like that,
Cabriales said, was something that
simply had never happened for
most of the queer students of color
who attended.
"We create, deconstruct, rei-
magine community constantly,"
Cabriales said.
Empoweringthe community
The structure of the Coalition
reflects its commitment to a sense
of community. The organization is
non-hierarchical, and even though
there are designated chair and
core positions, that's just for orga-
nizational reasons. The Coalition's
core doesn't have a designated
leader or leaders making executive
decisions: Everyone participates in
the process together.
The Coalition also gives agency
to its general members who might
not sit on the executive board but
still have the power to plan and
organize events around their
interests.Atthe Coalition'sgeneral
meetings, all members spend up
to two hours together, discussing
what they'd like to focus on that
month. If someone comes forward
with an idea for an event they'd
like to plan, the Coalition gives that
person the opportunity to plan and
spearhead the event themselves.
"We're really about making sure
that when we say we're a commu-
nity, we actually have action behind
it," Uduma said. "So this is a chance
for peopleto get involved with what
they're passionate about."
Ngo, for example, organized
a Coalition event that addressed
domestic violence and intimate
partner violence last year, even
though he didn't hold an official
position at that time. Though he
wasn't a part of the core and had
little experience, the Coalition
gave him the agency to lead the
event and make it his own.
"I still felt like a part of the com-
munity anyways and felt empow-
ered to plan this event," Ngo said.
That emphasis on community
and engagement is what drew
Engineering freshman' Sebastian
Rios to the Coalition. He attended
the organization's first mass meet-
ing this year and was blown away
by how many people of different
identities he met.
"I really think it's important for
an organization to have an active
role," Rios said, "to bring some sort
of supportto minorities and to sub-
groups in the community."
Rios also attended one of
the Coalition T(ea)s, which he
described as an ongoing dialogue,
where people can discuss and
analyze the societal implications,
attitudes and misconceptions
about relevant topics. The Coali-
tion invites queer people of color,
straight people of color, queer white
people and straight white people to
participate in these dialogues.
The Coalition T(ea) conversa-
tions are another way the Coali-
tion constructs new spaces for
people to share their experiences
and connect with others, ulti-
mately building on that foundation
of racial love and radical self-love.
Most of the teas are held at public
spaces like the Espresso Royale

on State Street, but the Coalition
also makes sure to host some teas
in private, undisclosed'places for
people who may prefer anonymity
when discussing their identities.
"I think that just because we are
talking about things that no one
else is talking about, that breeds
a sense of intimidation or fear,"
Ngo said. "But all we are doing is
reclaiming spaces and our own
experiences and saying we need
spaces to talk about these issues.
And if that's radical, then so be it."

The onlyslightly comi-
cal aspect of Seasonal
Affective Disorder is its
ever-so-appropriate acronym:
SAD. It does, in fact, make you
sad. But
beyond that,
there's noth-
ing even rel-
atively funny
about this
condition,
especially
for us Michi- CARLY
ganders. KEYES
A recur- -
rent winter
depression also known as the
"winter blues," SAD usually
begins in October or Novem-
ber and subsides in March or
April, and includes symptoms
like "oversleeping, daytime
fatigue, carbohydrate craving
and weightgain, and in more
extreme scenarios, hopeless-
ness, social withdrawal and sui-
cidal thoughts," accordingto the
National Alliance on Mental Ill-
ness (NAMI) Michigan Chapter.
The depth of the havoc
wrought by SAD relates to
the amount of daylight during
autumn and winter, which can
affect levels of chemicals and
hormones in the brain like sero-
tonin, a mood elevator, and mela-
tonin, a sleep-pattern regulator,
according to University Depres-
sion Center.
So, it makes sense that SAD
hits Michigan hard - our win-
ters are a never-endingsupply of
gray days and a lengthy string of
sorry-lookingskies. (Note to self:
another good reason to move to
Los Angeles when I graduate.)
The less the sun shines, the
less we shine inside. Obvious,
right? We all know that it feels
inherently better when we look
up at the sky and see a bright,
blue abyss rather than a dull,
drab oblivion. But we can't
ignore the hard science of SAD,
because it reveals why one of
the most effective treatments
for this mental health disorder
and the like is anti-depressant
medication.
I don't advocate relying on
an all-powerful "magic pill"
to do all the work for you,
to chase away the blues and
illuminate your eyes with
rainbows. University Depres-
sion Center suggests all of
the usual, undeniably help-
ful activities to combat SAD:
Get plenty of exercise, spend
time outside, eat a healthy
diet and practice relaxation
techniques like meditation
and yoga. NAMI also recom-
mends installing bright, white
fluorescent light bulbs, or a
special lamp, as a form of "light
therapy."
But in the midst of a depres-
sive state, sometimes it's not

so easy to move a muscle
to change a thought. Tell-
ing someone who's clinically
depressed to "just cheer up"
is like telling an alcoholic to
"just quit drinking." This is not
a quick fix. Depression, like
alcoholism, is not a conscious
choice; it's a mental illness.
And to end my own battle with
depression, I needed more
than help from Mother Nature.
First, I needed a doctor.
During the fall semester of
my freshman year at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania; despite
my success in the classroom
and on the soccer field, I start-
ed feeling down for no reason.
Pretty soon, I had every SAD
symptom. But I just chalked
it up as standard fatigue from
an incredibly active, stressful
lifestyle.
I was wrong. Soon, there
was nothing standard about my
fatigue. Every day was a strug-
gle to get out of bed, to get to
class, to get through a training
session, to get toothpaste on my
toothbrush. I morphed from a
3.5 GPA student in the Wharton
business school and a starter on
the varsity soccer team into a
lethargic zombie behind closed
blinds with a Taking Back Sun-
day playlist on repeat.
You can't just
will yourself to
be happier.
"What is happening to me?"
I thought. "Who would choose
this?"
Then my gradesdropped like
crashingstock, and I was onthe
verge of quitting the soccer team
because it was hard to sprint
around a track when a walk to
classbecame a chore. Miserable
and hopeless, I finally admitted
that I needed more help than I
could give myself and made an
appointment with the Pennclinic.
After a few weeks on medication,
I went on a run for the firsttime
in months, and I cried my eyes
out afterward because I feltlike
myself again.
Just as a diabetic, or anyone
else with a chronic condition,
needs dailymedication, I'm no
different. Mental health disorders
are no different. So, if SAD dark-
ens your doorstepthis season, and
you find yourself in a situation like
mine, where self-care is futile,
don't be afraid to seek additional
help. It made all the difference
for me.

said. "At first, I always thought gay
bars were like,you know,just danc-
ing and everyone going crazy.
"It's the only gay bar in town,
but I don't think people really see it
like that. It stands on its own - the
place with the patio, the place with
the good brunch. I guess maybe
when they opened, it was alittle bit
different."
Before 1995, when Aut Bar
opened, another gay bar was
already in business. But its conduct
toward -customers disturbed Orr.
At a time when the AIDS epidemic
was at its peak, it was "painfully
obvious" to him that the bar wasn't
gay-owned.
"Across the nation, bars were
where fundraising was happen-
ing and where information was
being disseminated and sometimes
where you were finding out if peo-
ple were alive or dead," Orr said.
"Our local gay bar refused to do
anything, to have AIDS mentioned
- any fundraising - not even a col-
lection jar."
Orr and his partner, Martin
Contreras, had already been run-
ning a Mexican restaurant when
it became apparent that a new bar
was needed, one unashamed of
its demographic and rooted in the
struggle of the community.
"Straight folks are absolutely
welcome," Orr said, "as long as they
understand that it's a safe place for
the gay community. And we need
safe places - still."
The placeinwhich Aut Bar rests,
Braun Court, is a hub for LGBTQ
activism. Next door stands Orr's
second business, the Common
Language Bookstore, and next to
that, the Jim Toy Community Cen-
ter. Looking out through Aut Bar's

windows, across the patio, you can
see Shout, a venue that the Michi-
gan International Gay Rodeo Asso-
ciation rents outeach year.
Orr elaborated on the urgency of
activism as a whole.
"It energizes people and reaf-
firms them," he said. "If you're an
NRA member, all you have to do is
turn on the TV or go to the multi-
plex, and you get reaffirmed every
minute of every day. If you're a gay
man, you don't necessarily have
that constant reaffirmation in soci-
ety."
One of the ways by which Aut
Bar revitalizes the community
is OUTFest - a celebration of
National Coming Out Day. When
Orr and Contreras came into
business, they took over the cel-
ebration from the Washtenaw

Rainbow Action Project, rebrand-
ed it and moved it into the Kerry-
town area.
"The first year, it was all about
having a free event that had
enough sponsorship to cover the
expenses," Orr said. "Each year,
we added more fundraising com-
ponents (such as) a silent auction,
sponsorships (and) we rented
vendor booths, even selling little
trinkets like rainbow beads. It all
adds up.
"One year," Orr added, "we
raised up to $22,000 after expens-
es."
Aut Bar also hosts events for
the HIV/AIDS Resource Center
that services Jackson, Lenaw-
ee, Livingston and Washtenaw
Counties. This fall, it'll hold a
wine raffle. From each of their

participants, the bar asks for a
single bottle of wine, which they
collect and put into one big pot,
and for as little as $5, winner
takes all.
"I love it because it's a very
democratic event," Orr said. "We
use a lot of people to raise a lot
of money, each giving a little bit.
This is my favorite type of fund-
raising. ... And we call it an Ann
Arbor Wine Seller because you
get an instant wine cellar if you
win."
Their most famous fundraiser
occurred in 2001, in the upstag-
ing of Fred Phelps, leader of the
Westboro Baptist Church, when
he decided to picket their busi-
ness. They pledged to pay a dol-
lar every minute Phelps protested
outside the bar. They reached out
to their email list to do the same.
"Let him stay as long as he
wants," Orr said.
Within one minute, somebody
had pledged a dollar. Where some
fundraisers take a whole year
to plan, this was planned in half
an hour. They ended up raising
$7,500 in one day, in one hour.
"If you answer hate with hate,"
Orr said, "hate wins."
Though the bar is empty at 4
p.m., its workers are still about.
Outside, the weather grows cold,
each hour dimming into evening
into night, each more drizzling
and bitter than the last. But inside
the bar, it's warm.

tour the upstairs bar. The floor,

ored in black and white and blue.
As he explained, the room follows
the color motifs of the Leather

himself for a while; he explained
why he came to Ann Arbor,
where the community is strong
and vibrant, and he spoke about
how work used to be a four- to
five-day-a-week routine. Now, he
comes to work five or six days a
week.
Then, we shook hands - kara-
