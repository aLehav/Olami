University
community aids
recovery in New
York, New Jersey
By FARONE RASHEED
For the Daily
As the effects of Superstorm
Sandy continue to resonate
across the East Coast, the Uni-
versity community has continued
to take an active role in the relief
?ffort.
The impactof the storm on the
University students and alumni is
pervasive, as many students are
from New York and New Jersey,
two of the states most affected by
the storm. The largest percent-
age of out-of-state students hails
from New York. There are 1,515
students from the Empire State,
and 1,053 students from New Jer-
sey.
Though many students and
faculty were safely residing
in Michigan at the time of the
storm, its impact was still pres-
ent miles away.
Kenneth McElwain, a Japa-
nese studies and political science
professor, said though the storm

did not affect him, it did impact
his wife, who lives in the Murray
Hill neighborhood of midtown
Manhattan.
"My wife spent the week at a
friend's place in the Upper West
side, as the apartment's power
was out for about a week," McEl-
wain explained. "She worked
from the friend's apartment, as
the subways were out and taxis
were impossible to find (due to
lack of gasoline)."
Engineering sophomore
Gulam Islam, an 18-year resi-
dent of Jackson Heights, Queens,
explained that though his neigh-
borhood was one of the lesser-
affected areas of the city, the
news from home was astonishing
nonetheless.
"I've never seen New York
shut down - it's the city that
never sleeps," Islam said.
He noted that even upon his
return home for Thanksgiv-
ing break, the subway system
was not yet at full capacity and
was still running on an adjusted
schedule.

FINAL COUNTDOWN

Students, faculty
make difficult
adjustment away
from East Quad
By STEPHANIE DILWORTH
For theDaily
The students of the Univer-
sity's Residential College are
homesick - not for their home-
towns, but for East Quad Resi-
dence Hall.
As the first semester of hous-
ing the RC in West Quad Resi-
dence Hall comes to a close,
many students, staff and fac-
ulty members of the program
expressed negative feelings
towards their temporary home
for the year. The move was a
result of renovations to East
Quad, slated to be complete by
September 2013.
RC students typically live
and attend classes in East Quad
as part of the two-year living-
learning community require-
ment. This year their temporary
home is shared with a variety of
other students such as Wolver-
ine athletes, Michigan Commu-
nity Scholars Program students
and other LSA students.
Charlie Murphy, a RC stu-
dent services assistant, said he
believes East Quad was more

convenient for the learning
community, and more likely to
build communitytthan their cur-
rent home.
"It's easier to build communi-
ty when faculty, students, class-
rooms-and facilities are all in the
same place," Murphy said. "The
amount of contact that students
are going to have with faculty
and staff members is substan-
tially greater in East Quad. I'll
be very happy to get everybody
under one roof again."
' Elissa Bell Bayraktar, a RC
French language and literature
lecturer, said she feels the equip-
ment in East Quad was not up to
date and needed to be replaced,
adding that she is enthusiastic
about the new technology that
will be available next fall.
"It was kind of dark in the
basement and the carpet was
old," Bayraktar said. "Things
were getting run down. I'm
looking forward to better
equipped classrooms and to my
understanding the new East
Quad will have all kinds of new
equipment."
According to Robin Goldberg,
the RC student affairs coordina-
tor, East Quad's extensive reno-
vations include new technology
in all classrooms, updates in stu-
dent' rooms and a redesigned
dining hall. Additionally, the
art studios will be updated, staff

Gov. Rick Snyder has used a
visit to Canada to praise the eco-

new Canadian-financed bridge
between Detroit and Windsor,

The Republican leader was in
Toronto on Monday to announce
plans for the opening of a Mich-

the Canadian Council for Public-

Snyder says that with the

The cost does not include more

accounting of over $9 billion
to head off damage in the next
disastrous storm, including steps
to protect the power grid and cell-

"It's common sense; it's intel-

Netanyahu's party picked a

Barring another comeback by
the mercurial former general,
Barak's departure marked an end
to a distinguished and tumultu-

mixed record in politics that was
highlighted by failed peacemak-

Hedge fund manager
in insider trading case
freed on bail in hearing

In this Friday, Nov. 23, 2012 photo released by the Egyptian Presidency, President Mohammed Morsi speaks to supporters outside the
Presidential palace in Cairo, Egypt Morsi's claim on new powers has angered critics, who called the decision an assault on democracy.
orsi defends expanded
powers as anger -mounts

Egyptian president
seized near absolute
power last week
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's Presi-
dent Mohammed Morsi struck
an uncompromising stand
Monday over his seizure of
near absolute powers, refusing
in a meeting with top judicial
authorities to rescind a package
of constitutional amendments
that placed his edicts above
oversight by the courts.
Morsi's supporters, mean-
while, canceled a massive rally
planned for Tuesday to com-
pete with a demonstration by
his opponents, citing the need
to "defuse tension" at a time
when anger over the president's
moves is mounting, according to
a spokesman for the president's
Muslim Brotherhood.
The opposition rally was
going ahead as scheduled at Cai-
ro's Tahrir square, birthplace of
the uprising that toppled Hosni
Mubarak's regime nearly two
years ago.
The meeting between Morsi
and members of the Supreme
Judiciary Council was a bid to
resolve a four-day crisis that has
plunged the country into a new
round of turmoil, with clashes
between the two sides that have

left one protester dead and hun-
dreds wounded.
Morsi, according to a presi-
dential statement, toldthe judges
thatwhiletheconstitutionaldec-
laration he announced Thursday
grants him immunity from any
oversight, he intended to restrict
that to what it described as "sov-
ereignty issues."
The vaguely worded state-
ment did not define those issues,
but they were widely interpret-
ed to cover declaration of war,
imposition of martial law, break-
ing diplomatic relations with a
foreign nation or dismissing a
Cabinet.
The statement did not touch
on the protection from over-
sight Morsi has extended to two
bodies dominated by his Broth-
erhood and other Islamists:
The 100-member panel tasked
with drafting a new constitu-
tion and parliament's mostly
toothless lower chamber, or the
Shura council.
The Shura Council does not
have lawmaking authorities
but, in the absence of the more
powerful lower chamber, the
People's Assembly, it is the only.
popularly elected body where
the Brotherhood and other
Islamists have a majority. The
People's Assembly was dis-
solved by a court ruling in June.
The judiciary has pushed


back, calling the decrees a power
grab and an "assault" on the
branch's independence. Judges
and prosecutors stayed away
from many courts in Cairo and
elsewhere on Sunday and Mon-
day.
A spokesman, Yasser Ali,
said Morsi told the judges that
he acted within his rights as
the nation's sole source of leg-
islation, assuring them that the
decrees were temporary and
did not in any way infringe on
the judiciary.
Two prominent rights law-
yers - Gamal Eid and Ahmed
Ragheb - dismissed Ali's
remarks.
Eid said they were designed
to keep "Morsi above the law,"
while Ragheb said they amount-
ed to "playing with words."
"This is not what Egyptians
are objecting to and protest-
ing about," Ragheb said. "If the
president wanted to resolve
the crisis, there should be an
amendment to his constitution-
al declaration."
In Washington, U.S. Secre-
tary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton spoke Monday by tele-.
phone with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Mohammed Kamel
Amr to "register American con-
cerns about Egypt's political
situation," according to spokes-
woman Victoria Nuland.

SEC: $276 million
scheme largest in
history
NEW YORK (AP) - A former
hedge fund portfolio manager
accused of enabling a quarter
of a billion dollars in profits by
passing along inside informa-
tion in one of the largest insider
trading fraud cases in history
appeared in a Manhattan court
for the first time Monday and
was released on $5 million bail,
though his movements were
restricted.
Mathew Martoma, 38, of
Boca Raton, Fla., was read his
rights by U.S. Magistrate Judge
James Cott, who agreed to
imposea bail package that pros-
ecutors and Martoma's lawyers
had worked out after his initial
court appearance in Florida last
week. He had been free on $5
million bail in Florida as well.
Martoma must post $2 mil-
lion in cash or property by next
week to satisfy the new bail
requirements, which will limit
his travelto NewYork, New Jer-
sey, Florida and Massachusetts.
Martoma was arrested last
week on charges that between
20,06 and 2008, he helped to
engineer one of the largest
insider trading frauds in his-
tory. Martoma worked with CR
Intrinsic Investors, an affiliate
of SAC Capital Advisors. SAC is
owned by Steven A. Cohen, one
of the world's richest men.
His court appearance lasted
only 12 minutes and he was not
required to enter a plea, since
an indictment has not been
returned. Prior to the hearing,
he sat in the spectator section
with his wife and lawyers until
his case was called.
Martoma's lawyer, Charles

Stiliman, provided a matter-of-
fact analysis to a court hearing
that was more process than sub-
stance.
"We took care of business
today and we'll be back another
day," Stillman said. Afterward,
Martoma could be seen walk-
ing down a courthouse hallway
clasping hands with his wife.
He left the courthouse after
the couple both signed papers
pledging that Martoma would
follow the conditions of the bail
package, which include surren-
dering any travel documents
belonging to himself and his
children.
Martoma was arrested on
Nov. 20 in Florida. Prosecutors
say he exploited an acquain-
tance with a medical school
professor to get confidential,
advance results from tests of an
Alzheimer's disease drug.
They say he shared the infor-
mation with others, enabling
more than $276 million to be
made illegally for his fund and
others. The government said
in court papers that he caused
other investment advisers to
buy shares in the drug compa-
nies, and then he and the oth-
ers ditched their investments
before the public found out
about the drug trial's disap-
pointing results, allowing them
all to make big profits and avoid
huge losses.
Court papers in Martoma's
case repeatedly allude, without
using Cohen's name, to his deal-
ings with Martoma in the lead-
up to an announcement about
the drug trial.
The FBI subpoenaed SAC and
other influential hedge funds in
November 2010. Martoma is the
fourth person associated with
SAC Capital to be. arrested on
insider trading charges in the
last four years.

Talks in Egypt
first since start of
ceasefire
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
and Palestinian militants from
the Gaza Strip began indirect
talks Monday in Egypt aimed
at forging a new era of relations
between the bitter enemies fol-
lowing a cease-fire that ended
the heaviest fighting in nearly
four years.
The talks, being mediated by
Egypt, were the first negotia-
tions since the cease-fire took
effect last Wednesday, halting
eight days of airstrikes target-
ing militant groups in the Pal-
estinian territory and rocket
attacks that reached deep into
Israel.
Israel launched some 1,500
airstrikes in a bid to end rocket
attacks out of Gaza, while the
Hamas and the Islamic Jihad
militant groups fired a similar

number of rockets at Israeli
cities. More than 160 Pales-
tinians, including dozens of
civilians were killed. Palestin-
ian attacks killed Six Israelis,
including four civilians and
two soldiers.
Now that fighting has sub-
sided, Egypt is working with
the sides on carrying out the
second phase of the agree-
ment: negotiating new border
arrangements for the impover-
ished coastal strip.
The negotiations will not
be simple. The militants want
Israel to lift what remains of
its blockade of Gaza, imposed
five years ago after Hamas
seized control of the territory
from its Western-backed rival
Palestinian President Mah-
moud Abbas. While Israel has
eased the blockade in recent
years, key restrictions remain
in place on exports out of Gaza
and the entry of badly needed
building materials into the ter-
ritory.

Stem cell support needed
Michigan should invest in innovative research
Four years ago, Michigan made an important step forward for
science. The state passed Proposal 2, a 2008 ballot proposal,
and ended the 30-year ban on embryonic stem cell line usa
in Michigan. However, little progress has been made since then, as
the state has not garnered the funding necessary to support these
projects. Now Michigan is falling well behind the rest of the coun-
try and is stuck looking for ways to revive a depressed economy.
Michigan and the University must make stem cell research a top
priority, and allow it to jump-start the science economy.

Solutions, not criticisms

'm now about halfway through
my junior year, a fact I'm often
reminded of when I return
home for the
holidays. Asking
what I plan on
doing with my
life is no longer
a generic ques-
tion to fill in an
awkward pause;
it's now a prac-
tical question ADRIENNE
demanding a ROBERTS
somewhat rea-
sonable answer.
And what exactly have I learned in
my classes that will help me in my
future, unknown career?
It's a tough question to answer,
because I really don't exactly know
how to express what I've learned in
my classes. I came to the University
of Michigan - like many other stu-
dents - to get a liberal arts educa-
tion, one that, by definition, teaches
me "how to think" - how to think
"critically" that is.
The word "critically" seems to be
a buzzword for the value of attend-
ing a university. But a Tedx video I
watched echoes this idea. Sir Ken-
neth Robinson, a world leader in
developing education, says, "I think
you'd have to conclude the whole
purpose of public educationthrough-
out the world is to produce university
professors." He argues that as chil-
dren we're extremely creative in our
thinking and that dwindles through-
out our lives. Creative thinking isn't
rewarded. By the time we finally
receive a university education, we've
-become so afraid of being wrongthat
we're more comfortable analyzing
than we are solving.
Looking back at the classes I've
taken here at the University, the
one common theme is that there's
analysis - and a lot of it. It becomes
so easy, and so ingrained in our
education, to be, well, "critical"

of anything and everything. Yet, a
Pew survey from May 2012 found
that in traditional colleges across
the country, 36 percent of students
showed little to no increase in criti-
cal-thinking skills. It's an astonish-
ing low percentage considering that
the purpose of most universities is
to teach this type of thought.
However, the same Pew study
also finds that 86 percent of the col-
lege graduates surveyed believe their
schooling has been a good invest-
ment, despite ever-increasing costs.
So there still may be benefits to be
gained from obtaining a college
degree, but they may not come in the
form many expect.
According to Philip Hanlon, the
University provost and executive
vice president for academic affairs,
"service learning courses, entrepre-
neurial activities and undergraduate
research encourage students to think
creatively and engage themselves in
a situation where they don't know
the outcome." He argues that extra-
curriculars are equally, if not more,
important than traditional classes.
While the University encour-
ages students to get involved with
extracurriculars when they enroll,
the importance of such activities
is not emphasized enough. Cre-
ative thinking - the thinking that
requires putting oneself in a situa-
tion with unpredictable outcomes
- is usually applied in activities
outside of the classroom.
My involvement with extracur-
riculars - which ranges from being
a research assistant for a professor to
writing outside of the classroom - is
what taught me most of the skills that
I'll apply to my future career(s); it's
what got me my internship this past
summer. I was fortunate enough to
realize that I should take the initia-
tive and join things outside of the
classroom. However, some students
don't take advantage of this simply
because they don't know that extra-

curriculars are now something that's
almost a requirement.
Today, the average American
switches their career five to seven
times. creative-thinking skills are
crucial to making successful transi-
tions and adapting to various situa-
tions. Universities are behind in the
development of programs that pro-
mote this type of thinking. While
critical-thinking skills are a signifi-
cant part of higher education, they
shouldn't be the sole focus of a liberal
arts education.
Creativity may
be more useful in
an unpredictable
Job market..

In comparison to other states, Michigan
has lagged behind in fundraising for stem cell
research. Even after Proposal 2's passage,
Michigan has been slow to enact any signif-
icant changes due to a lack of interest from
private investors. According to the Detroit
Free Press, California provides $300 million
yearly for stem cell research, and Ohio has
been providing millions for similar research.
California has gone further, adding $1.6 bil-
lion in new investments, which generates
about 2,739 jobs annually.
Despite Michigan's fundraising obstacles,
the University has continued to be a leader in
stem cell research. Since 2009, the Univer-
sity has made several significant strides. The
National Institutes of Health added the stem
cell line UM4-6 to its registry, along with
two others that are pending NIH approval.
Michigan must continue to be a leader, par-
ticularly since the state hasn't received sig-
nificant funding. As one of the world's largest
research institutions, the University must

help lead the state to its goals for stem cell
research.
Evidently, with the vote in 2008, Michigan
residents support stem cell research. How-
ever, the state needs to supplement the Uni-
versity's efforts to innovate. The state must
make a stronger effort to support stem' cell
research. The University performs research
in embryonic, adult and reprogrammed cells
and has developed eight lines of stem cells.
The school's embryonic stem cell research
may lead to more effective treatments for dis-
eases such as juvenile diabetes, heart failure,
Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injuries.
Four years ago, Michigan made its voice
heard, but the state did not respond. With
one of the largest research institutions in
its backyard, it's time for Gov. Rick Snyder
to bring Michigan back into the stem cell
research conversation. Improving stem cell
research will have significant scientific ben-
efits and improve the state's economic status
for many years to come.

It's scary to think that we may
be squashing a child's creative abil-
ity through our current education
system. I'm lucky that I was able to
somehow turn my first-grade diary
entries into newspaper writing and
that my childhood curiosity trans-
formed into a research project. Our
University - and universities across
the country - must take a step back
and examine the skills they're teach-
ing in the classroom and decide
whether or notthese skills are totally
applicable to the job market today.
Because if they do this, they have the
potential to give students the unique
opportunity to experience risk and
the unknown before they ever leave
the comfort of the job title "student."
Then, the question of what students
learned in the college classroom may
not be so difficult to answer.

By the numbers

Students union

Numbers dominate our lives. Over Thanks-
giving Day weekend an estimated 43.6 million
people traveled several billion miles to consume
approximately 46 million turkeys across the
nation . If we did nothing but count the number
of turkeys raised in the United States this year
alone (254,000,000 in total) on the very hands
we use to trace them, it would take nearly a
decade. Yet, despite all this, very fewofus actu-
ally understand where our numbers come from,
how they are found or what they mean.
It's quite likely that not a single reader
stopped to question (let alone verify) whether
the numbers stated above were true. Luckily
for all of us, I don't intend to pull one over on
anyone and these statistics come straight from
the American Automobile Association and the
U.S. Census Bureau. However, this only leads
us to ask the next and more pertinent ques-
tion: How did they arrive at their numbers?
As with just about any number, there are three
methods: One can count, one can calculate or
one can approximate.
Counting is the first approach we're taught.
It consists of finding the number of elements
for some finite set of objects by increasing a
counter by a set unit for each element. This is
a more intuitive concept than the above defini-
tion would lead you to believe. If you have some
number of turkeys plopped down in front of
you, if you wish to count them, it's necessary
to mentally represent each turkey with a single
digit and then go up the number scale by one for
each new turkey. Whether the number is repre-
sented in binary in a computer or counted by a
robot in a turkey factory, counting establishes
a one-to-one correspondence between the ele-
ments of one set (number of turkeys) and the
elements of another set (fingers on a hand).
Inherent to counting is the idea of "ordinal-
ity," which states that of two given values, one
can either be greater than, less than or equal
to the other. Thus, a certain "order" is estab-
lished with respect to their values. This can
be honed further to the idea of "cardinality,"
which more explicitly reveals the value or
quantity of something. This is how we can go
from saying there are more turkeys over there
than here to saying there are five turkeys over
there and only four over here.

But to know the one-turkey difference
requires a whole new technique. And that
technique is calculation.
It's usually at this point that most people
end their mathematical career. They found
a tool for arriving at most numbers they feel
will ever concern them (after all, Johnny is
probably not going to give 7, 243 apples to
Jane). However, calculation - the ability to
transform inputs to outputs via mathematical
operation - equips us with a tool to under-
stand every number that could ever exist.
When numbers like the amount of people who
traveled (43.6 million) and the number of tur-
keys consumed (46 million) are incomprehen-
sible to the human brgin, calculation allows us
to manipulate them into terms we can fathom
- for each person who traveled, 1.055 turkeys
were consumed.
But to know that one turkey is a more infor-
mative answer requires a whole new tech-
nique. And that technique is approximation.
Approximating - representing an inexact
(though useful) value in place of an exact one
- is when we balance the ordinality and car-
dinality of calculated numbers with the time
and resources necessary to find and under-
stand them. Typically one approximates
when information is difficult to procure (How
many grains of sand are there in the world?)
or when further specificity does not radically
alter the answer (the number of atoms in your
body). The exactness required of an approxi-
mation is a function of the context in which
the value is placed. Sometimes it's better to be
close enough than exact.
From the one turkey whose outline resides
on our hands to the millions at the center of
this past holiday, numbers run our world
through and through. For as informative as
they can be, they can also mislead, obfuscate
and deceive. With three tools presented here
- counting, calculating and approximating -
we can more thoroughly question and answer
the world around us. Only then - only by
understanding how they are brought about -
can we truly grasp their meaning.

As University students, our lives
are often hectic. In addition to an
extensive course load, many of us
take part in athletic or club activi-
ties, while trying to spend time
with friends and family as often as
possible. But if we can pause as we
race through yet another semester,
we notice that the University seems
somewhat different from the pack-
age we were sold coming in. Tuition
bills are higher, job prospects dark-
er and the student body is more
uniform than the brochures from
orientation led us to believe. As
we notice these problems, it's also
clear that within the official chan-
nels, we lack the concrete ability to
change these things. It's with these
thoughts in mind that we've started
a student union.
We have formed the Student
Union of Michigan to confront the"
tough realities of rising student
debt and disappearing public edu-
cation. The University is leveraging
its existence on high student tuition
that's almost impossible to payback
and can't be forgiven through bank-
ruptcy or death.
It's our livelihoods that are
threatened by steady increases to
already-astronomical tuition pric-
es. This wasn't always the case. As
recently as 1996, tuition at the Uni-
versity was $5,710 per year, mak-
ing it possible for more low-income
students to attend the University
without having to take out massive
loans. Now, with in-state tuition at
close to $13,000 per year, the aver-
age University student graduates
with $27,000 in debt. On a 20-year
payment plan with a 6.8-percent
interest rate, the average student
would finish paying the loan in their
40s with an additional $22,464.88
in interest.
The University likes us to think
that a degree from the University of
Michigan will make us exceptional
and that it's worth the high cost, yet
the unemployment rate for Univer-
sity graduates is 8.1 percent, which
is slightly above the national aver-
age of 7.9 percent. For most of us, a
bachelor's degree from the Univer-
sity won't shield us from the worst
recession since the Great Depres-
sion. Nationally, half of recent col-
lege graduates are underemployed
or unemployed. There's no reason

to believe that University students
are exempt from this reality. This is
partly why 37.7 percent of Univer-
sity graduates pursue graduate and
professional degrees, because more
and more often, an undergraduate
degree by itself cannot guarantee a
middle-class lifestyle.
A graduate degree has become
the new ticket to a shrinking mid-
dle class. For many of us, pre-pro-
fessional training is built into our
undergraduate experience. But
with the expectations of higher
future earnings, medical school
and law school saddle students
with even heavier amounts of debt.
Whereas undergraduate debt might
top out at $100,000 in extreme
cases, law school and medical
school debt can easily eclipse that
sum. This is happening in an econ-
omy in which doctors and lawyers
are in less demand, and paralegals
and nurses are favored because
they do much of the same work at
a fraction of the cost. Nonetheless,
and despite the jobs data to the con-
trary, schools like the University
maintain that their products are
worth the price tags.
While the University increases
tuition with empty promises of
future employment, it claims that
it has suffered from education
cuts at the state level. Yet state
defunding doesn't tell the whole
story of rising tuition. In the past
10 years, state funding per student
has decreased 50 percent, while
tuition has increased 100 percent.
Tuition increases far outpace both
state defunding and inflation. The
populations hardest hit by tuition
increases are low income and
minority students, who will dis-
proportionately shoulder the bur-
den of student debt. Promises of
future tuition hikes, however, will
increasingly leave middle-class
students and their families with a
larger share of this burden.
The argument that students
understand the price of a Univer-
sity degree and it's our fault if we
end up with large amounts of debt
is shortsighted at best. University
administrators didn't tell us before-
hand that they would increase
tuition by 6 percent annually. Nor
were we privy to the corrupt deal-
ings on Wall Street that led to the

iZe
collapse of financial markets glob-
ally. To accuse students of know-
ing things we couldn't possibly
know - things that were happen-
ing without our consent - is wrong.
It points the finger in the wrong
direction and overlooks the fact
that, after the collapse of the hous-
ing market, schools like the Uni-
versity have become the new sites
of Wall Street speculation. Since
2007, the University has taken on
$2.3 billion in construction proj-
ects, including luxury facilities
accessible to only a small segment
of the University community. The
University finances these projects
through bonds backed by promises
of future tuition'increases that will
be borne disproportionately by low-
and middle-income students. Our
tuition bills are now partly under
the control of the University's cred-
itors.
Ultimately, it becomes-a question
of the role of students within the
University. Only as a unified group
can we fight back against tuition
increases that will bury current
and future University students and
their families in debt. Only collec-
tively can we combat the privatiza-
tion of the University that sacrifices
the quality and accessibility of edu-
cation in favor of profit. As such,
we have to address soaring tuition
in addition to its flip-side, which is
the University's continual assault
on labor from janitorial staff to
instructors. By keepingtuition high
and pay low, the University reaps
big profits for its executives and big
banks atour expense. In combating
this, we hope to articulate a new,
more democratic position for both
students and employees.
Fundamentally, we deserve to
have a say in how the University
runs and how our money is spent.
Whether you afford the tuition
increases or you have a pile of debt
waiting for you when you leave
school, we need to recognize that
blind tuition increases are antithet-
ical to our mission as a public uni-
versity and as an inclusive campus.
Join us to call for a freeze tuition
raises in the foreseeable future on
Nov. 29 in the Diag at 1p.m.

You know, that magic of some-
thing so deliciously unrealistic
that it could only have been cre-

Ask any moviegoer: There's
no doubt that films have a way
of romanticizing every facet
of life - the good, the bad, the
awkward, the surprisingly moist
and the downright tragic (How
could anyone never, ever, ever
want to get back together with
Joseph Gordon-Levitt? Zooey

transform our milestones and
mistakes into meaning-of-life
moments, plotting the concise
climax of our lives with the
simple crescendo of some Oscar-
worthy score. They paint our
lazy evenings with one of their
fancy filters, and before you
know it, life seems a little bleak
since that fervent sepia-toned
fire was snuffed from your heart
by that thing we call "reality."
The movie script has become
a model to which audiences -
OK, maybe just me - strive to
conform: Give me snowfall at
dusk, probably on a hill some-
where. Whatever - all that
matters is that it's picturesque,
and my piggies haven't fled all
the way home (ahem, hypother-
mia). Give me coils of Christ-
mas lights, perfectly timed to
illuminate the walkway to a
wreathed front door just as our
numb noses nearly touch (oh,
Joseph). Then cut to a scene of
my bedridden self scribbling in
a journal, chewing the pen cap
as, lost in thought, I reflect on
every moment that's contribut-
ed to the cozy climax of my past

/ I'm not who
I was before" Girl on Fire
she , warns on R
"Brand New
Me," the aptly
titled second track off of her
most recent release, Girl on Fire.
And she's not. Girl on Fire
serves as Keys's' reintroduction
to the world after three years of
being relatively inactive in music,
but instead of bringing back
the old Alicia Keys, Girl on Fire
serves to introduce a new Alicia,
or rather, a more updated one.
Keys worked with a variety
of collaborators on the album
- from Bruno Mars to Jamie
xx - and drew inspiration from
other genres and eras outside of
contemporary R&B, much like
Beyoncd did with 2011's 4.
"New Day," produced by her
husband, Swizz Beatz, and Dr.
Dre, is bombastically aggres-
sive and wildly feel-good, and
features one of the best choruses

in recent memory. 50 Cent also
released a version of the song
as a single, and while Keys does
an admirable job sing-rapping
her way through the verses, a 16
from a rapper like 50 could've
helped.
Songs like "Not Even the
King," "Limitedless" and "That's
When I Knew" feel out of place
with the current of personal
awakening running through
the album. Though Keys sounds
great on both, "Not Even the
King" and "That's When I
Knew" are slow, unoriginal bal-
lads that feel like failed attempts
at recreating the magic of her
first album. "Limitedless" is a
reggae-tinged song that, while
a good-natured attempt at a new
sound, lacks energy and could
use some of the ferocity of "New
Day." More, these three tracks
are back-to-back-to-back near
the end of the album, effective-
ly creating a hole and slowing
down much of the momentum
from the songs before it.
Funny enough, the two best
tracks on the album don't sound
like they're sung by a brand new
artist, but rather, a more mature
one. For "One Thing," Keys
enlisted Frank Ocean and the
producer behind his incredible
summer debut Channel Orange,
James Ho. It's easy to hear Frank
singing the song - the organ
twangs from "Forrest Gump"
and the bass slaps of "Pink Mat-
ter" are all over the track - but
Keys does an admirable job and

makes it her own.
The title track, labeled the
"Inferno Version" with the inclu-
sion of Nicki Minaj, is the perfect
Alicia Keys song. Over a break
drum beat and sparse piano
chords, Keys emphatically and
proudly toasts to an unstoppable
heroine while belting out trade-
mark ohhs and ahhs found on the
chorus of her other-hit, "No One."
"Girl on Fire" is only soft-
ened by the presence of Minaj,
an obvious commercial plug by
Keys's label, who attempts to
add some flair to the song but
sounds out of place. If Keys had
really wanted to includea female
rapper, she should've asked Eve,
Missy Elliott, or, in a fantasy
world, Lauryn Hill - more femi-
nist, tenured and soulful rappers
who haven't spit lines like "She
ain't a Nicki fan than the bitch
deaf dumb / You ain't my son
you my mothafuckin' stepson."
Maybe not the best rapper to
feature on a song about empow-
ering women.
Girl on Fire won't be the first
album Keys's new son will listen
to when he grows old enough to
appreciate her music. 'It isn't as
soulful as her first nor as catchy
as her second, but it is probably
the one he will appreciate most.
Girl on Fire doesn't sound like
Keys's previous work, which
may upset some diehard fans,
but itis powerful, emotional and,
though timid at times, ground-
breaking for a woman who has
already accomplished so much.

By LENA FINKEL
For the Daily
It's no secret that I'm a huge
fan of "The X Factor." I obsess
over the pop star wannabees,
cheering whenever my favorites
do well and booing when I dis-
agree with the audience. I con-
sider myself an official judge,
making calls before the actual
judges have a chance.
But when the group of judges
included Demi Lovato, I felt like
I had to intervene. I couldn't
imagine what possibly possessed
the producers and was quite per-
plexed when I heard the news
of her arrival. To be truly hon-
est, I was vehemently against it.
She seemed like another Disney
princess whose records were
Auto-Tuned moneymakers, not
art. Not to mention that she
clearly needs a new makeup art-
ist - yes, these types of things
do admittedly anger me.
We admit it,
Lovato has the
X factor.
So, when my roommate came
home from the World Series-
game claiming that Demi's ren-
dition of the National Anthem
was actually really good, I was
intrigued. I immediately took to
YouTube to watch her sing, and
from there watched countless
other videos on her numerous
fan websites.
I have to admit, I was
impressed! The girl has pipes!
She sings from her heart and
clearly puts everything she has
into her craft. Not only that,
but her songs come across as
relatable. She has written songs
about her personal struggles as
well as her estranged father.
In my research, I also found
she actually earned her role in the
Disney Channel Original Movie
"Camp Rock." Her audition blew
away producers and it wasn't long
before she landed her own show,

Listen, we're team Britney.
"Sonny with a Chance."
And while I previously found
it difficult to believe that a celeb-
rity could ever be truly bullied
as she often announces, read-
ing about her quickly proved me
wrong. She has been through
her share of bullies, bulimia,
self-mutilation and overall low
self-esteem. Being young in Hol-
lywooa can be difficult and I'm
impressed she had the guts to
check herself into rehab, and
even more impressed that she
made it out alive.
Unlike o many zother young
stars who seem to have gone off,
the deep end for good, Demi has
clearly made a comeback, and a
quick one at that. She recently
completed her summer tour
for her album - Unbroken -
and is working on her fourth

album, with the first single to
be released in December. She's
also the new spokeswoman for
Secret's anti-bullying "Mean
Stinks" campaign and contin-
ues to work with PACER and
its "Teens Against Bullying"
efforts.
What impressed me most,
however, was her genuinely
sweet and likeable nature. She's
clearly so sincere and before I
knew it, I was thinking that I
could actually see myself becom-
ing friends her. It only took one
day to change her from throw-
away judge on "The X Factor,"
to the girl who truly cares about
her contestants. I can admit
when I'm wrong, and I definitely
pre-judged Demi. Next time ,t
watch "The X Factor," I may just
cheer her on a little as well.

members, along with a dean from
another school, a student, Uni-
versity administration staff and
alumni.
The first job of the comnittee
is to narrow possible dean candi-
dates to a group of about 12, Han-
lon said. The committee then
conducts phone interviews and
narrows the list to about six, who
are brought to campus for more
interviews and tours before the
final three are selected and pre-
sented to Hanlon and Coleman.
UNIVERSITY
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
POLICY UNLIKELY TO
CHANGE
Coleman and Hanlon also dis-
cussed the recent ruling by the
U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals
that overturned Michigan's Pro-
posal 2 - the 2006 amendment
to the state constitution. that
banned affirmative action.
Early this month - with an 8-7
decision - the court struck down
Proposal 2, allowing university
admissions and employers to uti-

lize "preferential treatment" on
the basis of sex, race, color, eth-
nicity or national origin.
Coleman said the University
will not immediately change
any of its policies because
Michigan's attorney general has
appealed the ruling, and since
Fisher v. University of Texas,
another affirmative action
case, is before the U.S. Supreme
Court.
In this case, the Supreme
Court is reviewing the current
rule at the University of Texas
that automatically admits high
school students in the top 10
percent of their class to the uni-
versity.
The case will draw upon
several University cases, one
in which the Supreme Court
ruled LSA's use of additional
points to minority applicants -
a "mechanical review process"
- unconstitutional, and another
where the court ruled the Law
school's use of race as a "holistic
consideration" when reviewing
applicants, therefore constitu-
tional.
"Right now we are taking a
wait-and-see attitude and trying
to carefully analyze everything
at this time," Coleman said.

COLEMAN QUESTIONED
ABOUT BIG TEN
ADDITIONS
SACUA member Charles
Koopmann, a Medical School
professor, asked Coleman about
the recent addition of Rutgers
University and the University of
Maryland to the Big Ten, inquir-
ing if the transaction was for
purely monetary reasons and if
the new universities were a good
cultural fit.
Coleman acknowledged that
finances did playa role, but demo-
graphics were also part of the
decision, noting that the Univer-
sity has a "huge number" of alum-
ni on the East Coast. She said the
agreement came to fruition rap-
idly, but it will help the Big Ten
remain financially and athleti-
cally competitive in the long run.
"At the end of the day, the
geography made sense, the demo-
graphics made sense, the quality
of the institutions made sense,"
Coleman said.
The addition of Rutgers and
Maryland expanded the Big Ten
conference to 14 schools. Mary-
land will join the Big Ten on
July 1, 2014, and Rutgers is still
deciding when it will join.

offices will be relocated and a
sculpture garden will be added.
Goldberg explained that
architects designed the building
around the specific needs of the
RC with features like a separate
dining room for language lunch
tables for students in intensive
9 language classes.
While East Quad is closed,
RC students attend classes in
the Dennison Building. Faculty
offices are spread between South
Quad Residence Hall and Den-
nison. Goldberg said she feels
the dispersing of the RC across
campus has proved difficult, but
RC mentorship programs, forum
groups and student government
have been resurrected to enhance
a sense of community.
"The idea of residential col-
lege is to provide a small, liberal
DONOR
From Page 1
the Match Foundation.
In the past year, Michigan
jumped in state rankings of the
highest number of signed organ
donors from 42 to 39, accordingto
Holly Eliot, the project manager
at the University's Transplant
Center.
She said the electronic score-
board on the Wolverines For Life
website, established to motivate
potential donors, tracked the
number of donors between the
two schools.
"We just want to do anything
that gets people to notice," Eliot
said. "It's a decision you should
make for the right reason, but if
people do it to win a competition,
that's fine. It's a right decision
anyway."
Eliot added that the competi-
tion increases the chances that
patients on an organ waiting list
will receive a needed organ.
"The list is five years long
already, and we're tryingto short-
en that time from getting on the

with the support of the Central
Student Government and sev-
eral MBA students on campus,
UMEC examined different ways
through which waste could be
made sustainable.
Though the candidates for
president, vice president, direc-
tor of publicity, corporate direc-
tor, social affairs director,
honors and services director
and student's affairs director are
running uncontested, Roberts
believes that the candidates are of
exceptional quality.
"Considering the candidates on
the ballot that I've had past expe-
riences with, I've seen nothing but
positive leadership experiences,"
Roberts said. "I have confidence
in all of them to responsibly main-
tain their responsibilities to the
council if elected."
Though there are no can-
didates currently running for

erts said that the newly elected
executive board would handle
the selection process internally,

arts school experience within the
larger university," Goldberg said.
"It has been a challenge for us
to scatter that small liberal arts
school outside of our home. It's
been a huge transition for fac-
ulty and staff and for students as
well."
RC sophomore Ted Ma said he
also misses the sense of commu-
nity he felt in East Quad, which
he believes is lacking in West
Quad. He noted he does not like
having classes outside of his resi-
dence hall.
"It's definitely not as good liv-
ing in West Quad this year," Ma
said. "It's very annoying walking
to Dennison all the time. Every-
thing feels dissociated from the
RC and everyone is so spread
apart. It doesn't really feel like a
community. East Quad was weird
but it definitely had character, it
was likable."
RC sophomore Emily Preuss
added that her hall this year is

mixed with students from differ-
ent programs rather than strictly
RC, which she said weakens the
community feel.
"Most of my hall was all RC
kids last year, and this year it is
not," Preuss said. "In the West
Quad common areas you don't see
as many RC kids as in East Quad."
RC sophomore Maggie Hig-
gins added that she prefers living
in East Quad, but hopes the expo-
sure to more student groups in
West Quad can reshape what she
deems "RC stereotypes."
"I think it's really good for the
RC to have exposure to other peo-
ple, like athletes, so that other.
people can better understand
what the RC really means and
what kind of people are really
in the RC," Higgins said. "A lot
of the RC stereotypes aren't cor-
rect: that it's full of hipsters and
hippies, we're all in this place
where we don't associate with
other people, it's not true."

Norquist klout
is fading among
policymakers
WASHINGTON (AP) - For
decades, conservative lobby-
ist Grover Norquist vowed to
drive Republicans out of office
if they didn't pledge to oppose
tax increases. Many lawmakers
signed on.
But now, several senior
Republicans are breaking ranks,
willing to consider raising more
money through taxes as part of
a deal with Democrats to avoid a
catastrophic budget meltdown.
Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker
says the only pledge he will
keep is his oath of office. House
Majority Leader Eric Cantor
says no one in his home state of
Virginia is talking about what
leaders in Washington refer
to simply as "The Pledge," a
Norquist invention that dates to
1986. Georgia Sen. Saxby Cham-
bliss says he cares more about
his country than sticking to
Norquist's pledge.
It's quite an about-face for
senior members of a party that
long has stood firmly against
almost any notion of tax increas-
es. And while GOP leaders insist
they still don't want to see taxes
go up, the reality of a nation in
a debt crisis is forcing some to.
moderate their opposition to any
movement on how much Ameri-
cans pay to fund their govern-
ment. Republican legislators and
Democratic President Barack
Obama's White House are hag-
gling vigorously as they look
for ways to reach agreement on
detailed tax adjustments and
spending cuts before automatic,
blunt-force changes occur at the
new year.
"Oh, I signed it," Sen. Jeff Ses-
sions of Alabama said on Fox
News about Norquist's pledge,
adding he still supports its goals.
"But we've got to deal with the
crisis we face. We've got to deal
with the political reality of the
president's victory."

The naysaying about the
pledge is raising the question
of whether Norquist - a little-
known Republican outside of
Washington - is losing his posi-
tion of power within the GOP.
It's a notion that he calls ridicu-
lous.
"Nobody's turning on me,"
Norquist said Monday.
But he indicated he would
turn on lawmakers who defy
him, starting with Corker, who
Monday published an opinion
piece in The Washington Post
outlining an alternative to the
budget breakdown that includes
more revenue.
"Corker was elected to the
Senate because he took the
pledge," Norquist said on Fox
News. "He would not be a sena-
tor today if he hadn't made that
commitment. If he breaks it, he's
going to have to have a conversa-
tion with the people of Tennes-
see about his keeping his word.
And the same thing with other
people who are elected because
they made that written com-
mitment to the people of their
state."
At the White House, spokes-
man Jay Carney said Monday
that the shifting away from
Norquist signaled an opportuni-
ty for Republicans to work with
President Obama.
"They represent what we
hope is a difference in tone and
approach to these problems and
a recognition that a balanced
approach to deficit reduction is
the right approach," Carney said.
Norquist, the head of the con-
servative Americans for Tax
Reform, opposes tax increases
of any kind, whether eliminat-
ing deductions, a position some
GOP lawmakers say they're open
to, or raising rates. He has insist-
ed on hardline positions from
lawmakers and, for years, has
held outsized sway in the party
for someone who does not hold
public office. His pledge doesn't
allow any change to the tax code
that adds a dollar to revenues.
House Speaker John Boehner
has called that notion unrealistic

and has dismissed Norquist as
"some random person."
Nevertheless, Norquist has
maintained a certain level of
clout for years.
Heading into the 2012 elec-
tions, 279 lawmakers had signed
Norquist's' pledge, according to
Americans for Tax Reform.
But some who have signed
the pledge are having second
thoughts. And when the new
House is seated next year, no
more than 212 of them consider
themselves bound by the prom-
ise.
"I'm not obligated on the
pledge," Corker told CBS News.
"I was just elected. The only
thing I'm honoring is the oath
I take when I serve when I'm
sworn in this January."
He's not alone in his stance on
the pledge.
"When I go to the constituents
that have re-elected me, it is not
about that pledge," Cantor said
on MSNBC. "It really is about
trying to solve problems."
Chambliss, a veteran senator
from Georgia, said he signed the
pledge during an earlier cam-
paign when the country's debt
was nowhere near its current $16
trillion level.
"Times have changed sig-
nificantly, and I care more about
my country than I do about a
20-year-old pledge," Chambliss
told his local television station.
"Ifwedo it(Norquist's) way, then
we'll continue in debt."
"I'm frankly not concerned
about the Norquist pledge;"
Chambliss added.
Raising taxes, whether by
closing loopholes or raising tax
rates, is seldom a vote-winning
strategy.
President George H.W. Bush
broke his campaign promise to
not raise taxes; he ended up los-
ing re-election 1992.
Other Republicans, however,
now are willing to put addi-
tional tax revenues on the table
as a bargaining chip for a deal
with Democrats to get changes
in Social Security and Medicare
and pare down.federal deficits.


list to actually getting an organ.
We don't want our patients dying
because there aren't organs out
there," she said.
Jeffrey Punch, the division
chief of the transplantation sec-
tion of general surgery at the
University of Michigan Health
System, said he believes the ath-
letic rivalry helps effectively pub-
licize the donation opportunity.
"We think it's something we'd
like to be a model for how every-
one else promotes donation as
well," Punch said. "It's something
everyone can do. There's no cost
and no real downside. When peo-
ple see the good it can do, they
really understand very clearly
why it's something people should
do."
Punch said the state of Michi-
gan should aspire to register 85
percent of its population.
"Utah has about 85 percent,
so it's an achievable goal," Punch
said. "If the entire country did
that, it would make a huge differ-
ence."
He added the biggest challenge
to attract more organ donors is
convincing them that it is a safe

process.
"If there are people that don't
believe in it, we'd like to convince
them that they shouldn't be afraid
of it," Punch said. "People think
it's a threat to them, but donation
only happens when people die.
The threat is to the people that
need the transplants that can't
getthem."
Kinesiology sophomore Bry-
anna Gardner said she donated
blood for the second time at the
University and the fourth time in
her life because her mother has
lupus erythematosus, an autoim-
mune disease.
"I've already donated blood
and bone marrow for her, so I
already know the value donat-
ing blood can do for somebody,"
Gardner said-.
She added that some of her
friends felt hesitant about giv-
ing blood, but those that she
convinced to donate were happy
they did.
"It's that feeling that you did
something," Gardner said. "You
gave a little piece of yourself that
could help so many people; to
just give a little matters."

Sandy relief efforts. On Nov. 11,
the Big Apple Big Ten, a coali-
tion of alumni in the New York
City area from all of the Big.
Ten schools, convened to help
out on Staten Island crippled by
Sandy.
About 225 alumni - rep-
resenting the then 12 schools
of the conference, before the
recent addition of University
of Maryland and Rutgers Uni-
versity - were in attendance to
ride the ferry to Staten Island
together. The group included
about 75 alumni volunteers
from the University.
University alum Stephen
Snyder served as one of the co-
leaders of the volunteer effort.
"Everyone showed up wear-
ing school apparel, like Michi-

gan sweatshirts," Snyder said.
"It was like a Big Ten commer-
cial."
Once in the Dorgan' Hills
neighborhood of Staten Island,
the volunteers committed to
about 6 hours of physical labor
- tearing down walls and help-
ing with the cleanup. The fol-
lowing day, with the Michigan
basketball team playing in the
city, University alumni held a
pre-game at Professor Thom's, a
local New York bar, to fundraise
for the Sandy relief effort.
Back in Ann Arbor, advertis-
ing club 734 Promo, which helps
promote local businesses and
organizations on campus, has
also shifted its focus to Sandy
fundraising.
Business sophomore Josh
Sperling, a project manager and
one of six currently working
on the venture, is organizing a
"Thrift Shop" theme party - in
the spirit of Seattle hip-hop art-

ist Macklemore's latest hit sin-
gle - and will donate all profits
to the American Red Cross.
Sperling has negotiated a
partnership with The Necto
nightclub, and expects the
event to occur sometime Feb-
ruary. They aim. to attract
between 500 and 800 people to
the party.
"That's really how we'll mea-
sure our success - if we can
generate the campus buzz."
Sperling said.
Sperling said besides provid-
ing an opportunity for market-
ing experience in a real-world
setting, the project was for a
cause that seemed crucial to
support.
"It's really something we
can back and we can be really
enthusiastic about," Sperling
said. "This is a cause we all find
dear to us because we've all
had close friends who've been
affected by it."


with confirmation from the gen-
eral body of the Engineering
Council.
Engineering senior Crissie
Zuchora, the presidential can-
didate and current social affairs
director, explained the specific
qualities that she was looking
for in a prospective candidate for
director of administration.
"It is a pretty big role in terms
of the responsibilities," Zuchora
said. "I am looking for someone
who is going to be dedicated and
is willing to put in a lot of time
commitment."
Engineering senior Ahmad
Ayash, the candidate for director
of leadership, said he aspires to
create more skill-building oppor-
tunities for international students
on campus. Through seminars
for international students on lan-
guage improvement and interview
skills, he said he hopes to help
them secure jobs and internships.
"For many international stu-
dents, a lack of English-speaking
ability affects their chances at
securing leadership opportuni-
ties," Ayash said. "I hope to talk
to professors, encouraging them
to interact with students regard-

less of their le'vel of English."
Ayash also noted his desire
to create a greater awareness of
UMEC and other engineering
associations on campus, mainly
through advertising. One organi-
zation he has in mind is the Uni-
versity's chapter of the Society of
Women Engineers, a non-profit
working to increase opportu-
nities for woman engineers on
campus.
Though Roberts did not want
to dictate the council's agenda
for next year, he does hope the
council will work on permanent-
ly establishing an Engineering
vs. Business Olympiad - a com-
petitive three-day event taking
place between the two colleges.
Roberts also noted that the
council required improvements in
its workflow to change the "inef-
ficient operation of some depart-
ments of student government,"
and can continue to grow.
"We stand to gain a lot in
terms of operational efficiency by
improving our workflow, account-
ability and institutional memory,"
Robertsnoted. "I'lldefinitely chal-
lenge the next administration to
address this early on."

"I think when you look at the

I know that having that in there
and knowing that our coaching
staff, those guys that were on that
team, our administration, (were)
all a part of that, it's agood thing,"
Beilein said.
But with a game against a tal-

ented Wolfpack squad looming,
the coach admitted that he will
"probably not" pay much attention
to the magnitude of the ceremony.
In atypicalyear, an NIT Season
Tip-Off championship would be
the highlight of any team's non-
conference slate, but with a weak-
er-than-normal field in New York,
combined with N.C. State's pre-
season No. 6 ranking, this game
has long been circled as the mea-
suring stick for No. 3 Michigan
(5-0) heading into Big Tenplay.
While the Wolverines shined
in the Big Apple, the 18th-ranked
Wolfpack (4-1) had a rough
Thanksgiving week, spoiling what
could've been a matchup of two
top-5 teams at Crisler Center. Last
Sunday, N.C. State was blown out
by Oklahoma State in the finals
of the Puerto Rico Tipoff, before
struggling defensively against a
middling UNC-Ashville team at
home in an 82-80 win on Friday.
The Wolverines are firing on
all cylinders after wins over Pitts-
burgh and Kansas State at Madi-
son Square Garden last week.

game have been put to rest.
The biggeststoryline from New
York was Hardaway's play.
He scored 16 and 23 points in
the two games, which was quick-
ly overshadowed when he took
a knee to the head in the closing
minutes on Friday. But the junior
passed his concussion tests and
Beilein said he went all out in Sun-
day practice.
The Wolverines will look to
reverse their fortunes in ACC-Big

Despite the Big Ten captur-
ing last year's crown, Michigan
looked sluggish in a 70-58 loss at
Virginia last year and is 1-4 under
Beilein. But none of his teams
have garnered a ranking as high as
this year's team, though that's not
something Beilein, or his team, are
looking at.
"To do it in November, it's prob-
ably meaningless," Beilein said.
"Any of these rankings right now
are so premature that why even
pay attention to them. . mean, I
realize it sells - people want to be
able to talk about it. It'sgreat buzz,
I get all that.
"We don't talk about it at all. I

By LUKE PASCH
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan offensive coordina-
tor Al Borges has come under
fire from the public regarding his
second-half play-calling in Satur-
day's 26-21 loss to Ohio State.
Fans have criticized Borges's
calls in short-yardage situations,
as well has his use - or possible
misuse - of senior quarterback
Denard Robinson. Borges hasn't
spoken to the media and he isn't
scheduled to address reporters
this week. But on Monday, head
coach Brady Hoke backed Borg-
es's play-calling and said poor
execution was the main problem
from an offensive standpoint.
"I thought (Borges) called a
good football game," Hoke said.
"If we do a couple things better,
I think we'll all be much happier.
I thought the play-calling was
exactly what it should have been."
The turning point of the game
came on the first drive of the sec-
ond half, when Michigan was
driving with a 21-20 lead. The
Wolverines, picked up one first
down and advanced to midfield
before being held and lining up
for a punt.
Then, Hoke called a timeout
and decided instead that he want-
ed to go for it on fourth-and-three,
sending his offense back onto the
field. The Buckeyes held strong,
though, forcing a turnover-on-
downs and then converting a field
goal on the following drive.
On Monday, Hoke declared
emphatically that the decision to
go for it on fourth down was his
- not Borges's - and that he was
going with his gut. For a moment
before the timeout, he considered
fakingthe punt.
"That's the only thing I wish I
wouldn't have done was call the
timeout," Hoke said. "I should
have left them on the field and
gone for it.
"I just told (Borges) after I
called the timeout, 'Be ready, and
then go.' And I thought we had a
good play. In fact, we did have a
good play if we execute the block-

ing."
The play called in that situa-
tion was the same power forma-
tion Borges called with just over a
minute left in the first half, when
Robinson lined up in the shotgun
with three other players in the
backfield. In the first half, Robin-
son faked the sweep handoff and
kept the ball to the right sideline
with a convoy of blockers in front.
He bounced off a pair of defend-
ers and took it 67 yards to the end
zone.
After the game, Ohio State
coach Urban Meyer said the mes-
sage to his players at half time
was to stop Robinson from run-
ning the ball, and it was clear that
they were keying on him on that
fourth-down stop.
"My comment was, after I
saw Denard Robinson sneak out
of there for a long run, stop the
quarterback run," Meyer said.
"That's the input I had. Probably
the same, I think 107,000 people
said that as well."
Another issue fans have had
with Borges's play-calling was
the limited simultaneous use of
Robinson and junior quarterback
Devin Gardner. Against Iowa,
Gardner took many snaps with
Robinson lined up either at tail-
back or in the slot.
"We were helping our foot-
ball team because you're putting
your best 11 on the field," Hoke

said after the Iowa game. "I think
Denard fits in that either as a
quarterback or as a slot receiver
or wherever it may be."
It was evident in the first half
of the Ohio State game that Rob-
inson would not be throwing the
football due to his elbow injury.
But Borges did not try very hard
to disguise it, either. Nearly every
time Robinson was in the game,
Gardner was not, and Robinson
was taking the snap at quarter-
back. He would either keep the
ball himself or pitch it to a tailback
- passing was notan option.
It didn't take the Buckeyes long
to catch onto the game plan -
Gardner was passing, and Robin-
son was running. And without the
two on the field together, the play
calling was transparant.
"They were a little bit predict-
able in the first half," said Ohio
State co-defensive coordinator
Everett Withers. "You know, they
put (Robinson) back there, he
was gonna run it. And they put 12
(Gardner) back there, they were
gonna throw it."
Still, Hoke denies that the
plays were predictable because he
thinks they would have been suc-
cessful had they been e ecuted
properly.
"I don't think (it was predict-
able) because I think there were
plenty of opportunities," Hoke
said. "You have to block, too."

Road struggles becoming common for Michigan

Michigan has been
doubled up on goals
away from home,
readies for Bulldogs
By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily Sports Writer
Playing on the road in college
hockey is never an easy task -
facing the opposing student sec-
tion's taunts whenever play ends
up in its corner of the ice is tough
to handle.
And that's just one of many
obstacles that arise while play-
ing on the road.
Whether it's that effect or
something less tangible, the
Michigan hockey team has espe-
cially struggled away from Yost
Ice Arena this year.
Including the technically
neutral-site loss to Cornell on
Saturday at Madison Square
Garden, Michigan is 0-3-1 away
from Yost. The Wolverines have
allowed five goals per game and
scored just 2.5 goals per game
during those four appearances.
Notching the first goal can
become a crucial factor in road
appearances in order to elimi-
nate the crowd and to gain confi-
dence. But, more often than not,
Michigan has allowed the first
goal of the game.
"(Allowingthe first goal) defi-
nitely sets the tone for the rest of
the game and that's something
we need to work on," said fresh-
man forwal Boo Nieves.
