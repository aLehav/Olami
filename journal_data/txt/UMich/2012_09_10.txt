DPS: Suspect
similar to alleged
assailant at Natural
History Museum
By AUSTEN HUFFORD and
ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily Staff Reporter and Daily News
Editor
After three sexual assaults
were reported to University and
Ann Arbor Police over Labor
Day weekend, a student report-
ed that a similarly described
suspect suspiciously touched
her on Friday.
A student told University
Police that on Friday at about 6
p.m., a male suspect approached
her and talked to her in Chinese
at the Michigan League. The sus-
pect and student then walked to
an exterior bench near the Mod-
ern Languages Building, where
the suspect allegedly rubbed
the student's outer thigh and
grabbed her cell phone.

The student took her cell
phone back and left the area.
She reported the incident to
police at about 11 p.m. Friday
and described the suspect as a
5'8" Chinese male with short
black hair, who appeared to be
about 25 years old and report-
edly spoke with a heavy accent.
The description of the sus-
pect from Friday's assault is
most similar to that of the sex-
ual assault at the University's
Museum of Natural History,
where the suspect also spoke in
Chinese with a heavy accent and
had a similar physical descrip-
tion.
Diane Brown, University
Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman, said Univer-
sity Police do believe Friday's
suspect is similar to the sexual
assault at the museum, but
aren't making any connections
to the other incidents at Michi-
gan Stadium and at the corner
of Washtenaw Avenue and Hill
Street.

The sound that defined
the Michigan football
team's 31-25 win over Air
Force on Saturday afternoon?
It wasn't the many renditions
of "The Victors" that rang out
from the Michigan Marching
Band as the pageantry of college
football returned to Ann Arbor
for a 133rd season.
It wasn't the raucous cheers
that broke out from the Michi-
gan Stadium crowd when senior
quarterback Denard Robinson
did what he does so magically,

busting out
for touch-
down runs of
79 yards and
58 yards in
the opening
minutes of
both halves. BEN
No, it was ESTES
the thunder-
ous, agoniz-
.inggroan
that broke out whenever Falcons
quarterback Connor Dietz ran
towards the sideline and tossed

the ball to his pitch man, usually
running back Cody Getz.
The groan evoked disgust and
anxiety, since nearly every time
that Dietz looked to pitch it to
Getz, the latter found himself
defended solely by air - no Wol-
verine there to cover him, Getz
had free reign with open space
ahead of him until a Michigan
defender could hustle over and
try to save face.
The Wolverines had it cov-
ered on occasion, but not nearly
enough. Getz went for 133 yards

and three touchdowns for the
afternoon, averaging five yards
per carry, and he and the rest of
Air Force's triple option attack
was almostenough to pull
the upsetin Michigan's home
opener.
After two games that have
seen the Wolverine defense give
up 863 total yards, the abilities
of the rebuilt defense, which is
inexperienced in several spots,
are coming into question.
That yardage figure includes

While Republicans and Dem-
ocrats made headlines at their
national conventions over the
pastfewweeks, the state parties
also gathered in Grand Rapids
and Lansing, respectively, last
weekend to nominate candi-
dates at their state conventions.
The Michigan Republican
Party nominated University
alum, cardiologist Rob Steele,
the 2010 Republican challeng-
er to U.S. Rep. John Dingell
(D-Mich.), and Dan Horning,
a University Regent from 1994
to 2002, for the two open seats
for the University's Board of
Regents. The Democrats nomi-
nated Mark Bernstein, a Uni-
versity alum and president and
managing partner of the Sam

egent
Bernstein Law Firm, and Shau-
na Ryder Diggs, a dermatologist
and also a Universityalum. Uni-
versity regents are elected for
eight-year terms.
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) attendedthe Democratic
convention this weekend and
said he emphasized University
issues when speaking to attend-
ees.
"My part of
the event was 1
really to talk
to people about 11111111
what's going
on in the Michigan Legislature
and how they can be active in
elections this fall," Irwin said.
"Those issues that I was talking
to the delegates about ....were
issues that affect our University
communityveryclosely."
Irwin also spoke to disap-
pointing advances in higher
education funding, which has
been slashed in recent years.
"Republicans, in the last two
years, cut higher ed. by 15 per-
cent, which was an unprece-
dented cut to higher ed.,"he said.

Group offers
fresh produce at
stand outside of
Michigan League
By MOLLY BLOCK
Daily StaffReporter
Students seeking a fresh,
healthy snack between classes
now have the opportunity to
visit a new food stand with
an array of produce nestled

between Hill Auditorium and
the Michigan League.
The Ann Arbor Student Food,
Co-op. held its first weekly
fresh produce stand on Cen-
tral Campus from 11 a.m. to 4
p.m. lost Friday, with a colorful
table bursting with apples, car-
rots, kale, lettuce and avocados
at prices starting as low as 50
cents. The food stand, called
Brassica, derives its name from
the genus term for broccoli,
cabbage, cauliflower and other
similar vegetables, accord-
ing to LSA sophomore Mira

Fishman, the stand's sourcing
director.
"Brassica is one of the most
used and diverse families that
we eat from," Fishman said.
"It's a very easily manipulated
family so you can get lots of
products from it, which reso-
nates with our mission."
The group, founded last
semester, is a campus non-
profit student organization
that aims to provide affordable,
healthy, sustainable produce
on campus, Fishman said.

After 20 years, Eastern Michi-
gan University will officially
restore its long-banned mascot,
the Huron.
Though the official mas-
cot will remain the Eagle, the
Detroit News reported that the
revived Huron debuted on the
marching band's new uniforms
during the EMU-Illinois State
game Saturday in Ypsilanti.
The Huron was removed by
Eastern in 1991 to placate fears
about negative Native-Ameri-
can stereotypes. However, Billy
Friend, the chief of the Okla-
homa-based Wyandotte tribe
that represents the Hurons, told
the News they didn't consider
it "anything but an honor to the

Heavy rains could

81 killed, more
than 800 injured
on Friday
BEIJING (AP) - Survivors
of multiple earthquakes in
southwestern China waited
for shelter and other supplies
on Monday amid forecasts
of heavy rains that are likely
to hinder ongoing search
efforts.
The earthquakes on Friday
in a mountainous area top-
pled thousands of homes and
sent boulders tumbling down
slopes, killing 81 people and
injuring more than 800.
They struck a region of
small farms and mines near
the border between Guizhou
and Yunnan provinces, where
some of China's poorest peo-
ple live.
About 60,000 residents
from Jiaokui town in Yiliang
county, about 3 kilometers (2
miles) from the epicenter of
one of the earthquakes, had
been evacuated to open spac-
es, an official surnamed Guo
said by telephone from the
township government office.
Guo said only the older
survivors had tents, and that
food, water, cotton quilts,
clothes and medicine were
also needed.
The official Xinhua News
Agency cited local authorities
as saying mobile phone ser-
vices in the quake-hit areas
had been basically restored.
The region was expected
to be hit by medium to heavy
rains on Monday and Tues-
day, bringing the threat of
rain-triggered landslides
that could cause more casu-
alties and complicate search
efforts, Xinhua cited rescuers
as saying.
Footage from China Cen-
tral Television showed rescu-
ers and sniffer dogs running
past steep slopes because of
the risk of fist-sized stones

tumbling down. It also
showed an ambulance stuck
in stones and debris.
A resident of Luozehe
town, close to where the
quakes struck, said he and
others were evacuated to a
more central area of the coun-
ty. "It's quite hot here. There
isn't enough drinking water
or tents," said Wu Xuehong,
who described seeing dead
livestock after farm buildings
collapsed.
More than 11,000 tents,
10,500 quilts, 6,000 coats
and other supplies including
bottled water and rice have
been delivered to Yiliang and
more are on the way, Xinhua
said, citing the rescue head-
quarters.
The first magnitude-5,6
quake struck just before 11:30
a.m. Friday and was followed
by an equally strong quake
shortly after noon. Though
of moderate strength, the
quakes were shallow Such
quakes often cause more
damage than deeper ones.
. As of noon Sunday, there
had been 279 aftershocks,
said Zhang Junwei, spokes-
man of Yunnan's seismologi-
cal bureau.
Xinhua quoted ' Zhou
Guangfu, deputy chief of the
county's education bureau,
as saying that three students
were among those who died.
He said more than 300 high
schools and primary schools
were damaged and the edu-
cation bureau would inspect
schools before allowing class-
es to continue.
In 2008, a massive
7.9-magnitude quake in Sich-
uan province, just north of
Yunnan, left 90,000 dead or
missing, including thousands
of students whose schools
collapsed.
State media reported Sat-
urday that the army and
police had mobilized more
than 3,200 personnel to help
rescue efforts, along with

Jurors in Peterson
trial matched
outfits everyday
Among the many questions
that arose during Drew Peter-
son's murder trial, one of the
least weighty but most perplex-
ing was - what on earth were
jurors trying to say by meticu-
lously coordinating their clothes
each day?
They wore all yellow, then all
green, blue and black. They wore
alternating red, white and blue
once in a hint of the American
flag. The display that caused the
biggest stir was when all 16 wore
team jerseys - mostly supporting
the Chicago Bears and White Sox,
although there was one for the
Green Bay Packers.
Some of the 12 jurors and four
alternates cleared up the mystery

murder in the 2004 death of his

Jewish organizations have

Efraim Zuroff of the Simon

on Sunday called the mock ad in
the Eesti Ekspress weekly a "per-
verted attempt at humor at the
expense of the Nazis' millions of
victims."
' Sulev Vedler, deputy editor of
Eesti Ekspress, says the mock ad,
which ran in the paper's humor
section, was poking fun at an Esto-

nian gas company that recently
used an image of Auschwitz to
promote its services.
Vedler says the ad "was not
targeted against Jewish peo-

Outbreak of Ebola
virus kills 15 in

An outbreak of the Ebola virus
has killed 15 people in northeast-
ern Congo and the local commu-
nities are quickly learning how
frighteningly deadly the disease
is, and how to prevent its spread.
Health officials say the popula-
tion lacks knowledge of Ebola and
must learn that the tradition of
washing of corpses before funer-
als spreads the epidemic.
Although it is the ninth Ebola
epidemic in Congo, it is the first
one in the Haut-Ud6 territory, in
northeastern Congo. Ebola has
no cure and is deadly in 40 per-
cent to 90 percent of cases. The
disease causes severe internal

Olympic swimmer Peter Vanderkaay is honored at the second Mott Champions for Children award on Saturday.
O lympilan Vande rkaay

Alum receives
Mott Champions
for Children Award
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily StaffReporter
Isabelle Petit, a patient of
pediatric oncology at the C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital,
couldn't stop smiling Friday as
she presented her idol, four-
time Olympic swimming med-
alist and University alum Peter
Vanderkaay, with the second
annual Mott Champions for
Children Award.
Vanderkaay, who won a
bronze medal in the 400-meter
freestyle at this summer's Olym-
pic Games in London, began vol-
unteering at the hospital during
his freshman year at the Univer-
sity. As a member of the men's
swimming team, he won 14 Big
Ten Conference titles and was
named Big Ten Swimmer of the
Year his junior year.
At the event, held at the
Wayne and Shelly Jones Fam-
ily Center, Vanderkaay was
honored for his time spent vol-
unteering with patients and
families, as well asthe personal
contributions he made to the
hospital and the time he's spent
fundraising.
"It means a lot because he
gets to take time off of every-
thing and come visit us," Petit,
a swimmer herself, said.
Vanderkaay said he started
volunteering about 10 years ago
as part of the "Michigan From
the Heart" program, a non-
profit organization that brings
University athletes to Mott to

meet with children and their
families. Through the program,
he quickly developed a personal
interest in helpingthe hospital.
"This feels like home for me,"
Vanderkaay said. "I've just met
so many great people through
coming to the hospital and
some of the visits that it's just
become a part of my life."
The swimmer encouraged
University students to become
more involved in volunteering
while on campus.
"You see a lot of kids in here
who are dealing with some very
real issues, and you can try to
make that a little bit better for
them, even if it's just for five
minutes," he said. "It doesn't
have to be anything really pro-,
found or starting an organiza-
tion, but just volunteering and
doing little things helps in the
grand scheme of everything."
About 25 people, includ-
ing Vanderkaay's parents and
brother, attended the event.
Chris Dickinson, interim exec-
utive director for the C.S. Mott
Children's and Von Voigtlander
Women's Hospital, presented
Vanderkaay with the honor
before Petit and other children
from the hospital gave him the
award.
"He's such a wonderful sup-
porter of the hospital," Dick-
inson said. "I'm sure he's got
a thousand things to do rather
than come here and spend time
with us."
After a photo session
with some of the attendees,
Vanderkaay passed around his
Olympic medals - two gold and
two bronze - for the children
to hold, before visiting patients
around the hospital.

Inside the Child Life Activ-
ity Room, the Olympian sat
with about a dozen patients
who were painting wooden
chameleons. As he passed out
replica gold medals, one child
exclaimed "My very own real
gold!"
Children and parents alike
said they were excited to meet
the swimmer, including Evan
Wood, a swimmer and patient
in pediatric oncology.
"It's just a lot of fun, shaking
his hand," Wood said.
Jackie Bostwick, whose son
is a patient in the hospital, said
Vanderkaay is a role model for
all patients.
"He's represented our coun-
try (in the Olympics) quite
well," Bostwick said. "I just
think he's a good figure for
these kids."
Vanderkaay's father, Mark
Vanderkaay, said he was proud
of his son's contributions to the
hospital.
"He's being recognized for
being able to give back to kids,
sick kids," Vanderkaay said.
"(He's) trying to- bring a little
happiness into their lives. I
think it's awesome."
The first Champions for
Children Award was given to
former Michigan football play-
er Charles Woodson last year,
who donated $2 million to the
hospital in 2009.
Though Vanderkaay moved
to Florida about 18 months ago,
he said he would be in town for
a few days, and attended the
football game against Air Force
on Saturday.
"I loved being here,"
Vanderkaay said. "I'll be a Wol-
verine for life."

Egypt attempts restructuring
in. ordrto secure investors

Gov't seeks $4.8
billion IMF loan to
rebuild economy
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's
Islamist leader vowed to carry
out tough structural reforms
to overhaul his country's ail-
ing economy and create a bet-
ter environment for business
and investment, participants in
a meeting between corporate
executives and the president said
on Saturday.
The move by Mohammed
Morsi, who hails from the Mus-
lim Brotherhood, aimed to
assuage fears that an Islamist-
led economic program could
dampen investment, particularly
in tourism. Morsi vowed that
Egypt would remain a secu-
lar state, said Ahmed Ghanim,
head of biotech firm Bio Natural
America Institute.
Ghanim and two U.S. officials
in the meeting also confirmed
that Morsi went beyond previous
statements he has made about
adhering to Egypt's internation-

al accords, pledging outright to
over 60 U.S. delegates present
that he respects his country's
landmark peace treaty with Isra-
el. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood
has a decades-old enmity with
neighboring Israel.
The face-to-face at Cairo's
presidential palace was orga-
nized to introduce companies,
many of which already have bil-
lions of dollars invested in Egypt,
to the new president, who was
elected in June. It is part of a
four-day mission to Egypt orga-
nized by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. The 49 companies
on the trip are looking to secure
their investments and expand
profits under the new leadership.
The meeting was also a chance
for Morsi, Egypt's first freely
elected president and civilian
to take office, to send reassur-
ing messages that he views for-
eign investment as a key pillar
for development and alleviating
widespread poverty. The Broth-
erhood has always taken a strong
private-sector philosophy, and
many of its top figures and finan-
ciers are businessmen.

Deputy Secretary of State
Thomas Nides, who was among
a number of U.S. officials in the
meeting, said Morsi laid out a
broad vision for Egypt that was
"wholesome" and "focused".
"He was impressive and
understands the challenges his
country faces and understands
the importance of Egypt on the
world stage," Nides said after the
meeting.
Ghanim, an American-Egyp-
tian who founded his business
based in Royal Oak, Michigan,
said he wants to transfer his
technology to Egypt and help the
country of 82 million find clean
and innovative solutions to its
agricultural woes.
Entrepreneurs such as
Ghanim who are looking to
bring their businesses to Egypt
and large corporations already
working in the country complain
that under the previous regime
of longtime U.S. ally Hosni
Mubarak, a lack of transparency,
bureaucratic red tape, rampant
corruption and convoluted laws
made opening or expanding a
business extremely difficult.

Shop tl you drop
"Course shopping" leads to better scheduling
Syllabus Week isn't exactly a walk in the park, though its name
might suggest otherwise. Instead, it's a week spent trying to
register for the maximum number of credit hours without
time conflicts and sending frantic e-mails to professors begging for
overrides. However, on the East Coast, schools including Harvard.
University, Pennsylvania State University and Brown University are
"shopping" for classes. Unfortunately, the adding and dropping process
at the University of Michigan often locks students into classes without
allowing them to familiarize themselves with the course materials or
class structure - despite increasingly better course descriptions. The
University should implement a "shopping period" at the beginning of
the fall semester, not only to alleviate unnecessary stress and textbook
purchases, but to further promote academic ambition.

Eleven years later, deafening silence

Nearly one year ago, I wrote
a column about how our
generation makes sense
of the post-9/11
world we've
inherited. That
was the tenth
anniversary of
the 2001 attacks,
and tomorrow
will mark the
eleventh. DANIEL
Before Tues- CHARDE
day comes and
we observe
moments of
silence to honor those lost to terror
and war, I think it's fitting to reflect
on the challenges we still face - not
only as a nation, but as individuals.
One of the most obvious - and
costly - legacies of 9/11 is the ongo-
ing war in Afghanistan. This war is
the longest in U.S. history. As of Sep.
7, the Department of Defense reports
that the total number of Ameri-
can casualties in Afghanistan is at
2,106. However, this figure does not
begin to illustrate the human suf-
fering that underlies raw numbers.
Indeed, headlines like "War-weary
US is numbed to drumbeat of troop
deaths" are frighteningly accurate
observations of the widening gap
between domestic public opihion and
wars abroad. (For an excellent depic-
tion of life at war in Afghanistan, see
the 2010 documentary "Restrepo.")
The article attached to that headline,
written by Robert Burns, highlights
a recent spate of American deaths in
Afghanistan, including that of Pfc.
Shane W. Cantu of Corunna, Michi-
gan. Cantu was only 20 years old.
Despite all of the lives lost, this
protracted war does not figure
prominently in the minds of Ameri-
cans today. According to a July
2012 Rasmussen poll, only 30 per-
cent of Americans deemed the war
in Afghanistan a "very important"
issue. Meanwhile, as the November
presidential election approaches, the
economy remains the most pressing
concern for the majority of voters.
At the Republican National Conven-
tion, Mitt Romney did not once men-
tion Afghanistan. Clint Eastwood
referenced the war one time, but, like
most of his cringe-worthy speech, it
was incomprehensible. Similarly, at
the Democratic National Conven-
tion, President Obama mentioned
Afghanistan only twice. With the

exception of vague platitudes about
Israel and Iran, one would think
our presidential candidates can't
acknowledge the existence of any
other nation outside the U.S. border
- let alone that we've been at war
with one for almost 11 years.
At the core of this disconnect in
civil-military relations is a striking
paradox. Although we've become
willfully deaf tothe distant sounds of
war, we reflexively and unquestion-
ingly lavish praise on all American
men and women in uniform. Now let
me be clear: they deserve this praise
entirely. But what of those who failto
return home alive from their service
abroad? As the names of the dead
pile up and fall by the wayside in the
24-hour media machine, who among
us will offer them our gratitude for
their sacrifice?
After all, the most accessible
portrayal of warfare is currently
NBC's sanitized, sensationalized
and much-derided reality televi-
sion show "Stars Earn Stripes." We
are taught to have pride in, and give
thanks to, those who protect us,
but we refuse to acknowledge the
brutal, less-than-glorious reality of
war itself.
I was reminded of this on Sat-
urday, when the University of
Michigan hosted the U.S. Air Force
Academy for the first home football
game of the season. At the begin-
ning of the match, the crowd roared
as a B-2 Stealth Bomber flew over
the Big House. At halftime, in a for-
mation spelling out "America," the
marching band finished off their
military-themed show with a rous-
ing rendition of John Philip Sousa's
"The Stars and Stripes Forever."
In the student section, fragmented
chants of "U-S-A!" rang out across
the stands. And in an editorial pub-
lished last week, The Michigan
Daily endorsed a student initiative
to ban the fourth down "You suck"
chant - especially in time for the
Michigan vs. Air Force game, since,
they assert, "[i]t's important to
show other universities and sports
fans that Michigan students have
respect for those riskingtheir safety
for our nation's.'
This is all very well, but I find it
insincere to suggest that this, of all
things, is the best way to show those
who serve our country our respect.
Such efforts are well intentioned,
yes, but superficial.

Real respect requires more than
chanting patriotically and refrain-
ing from immature jeers. Respect
starts with honesty. The great
majority of us have grown lazy,
myself included. With the complic-
ity of the media and overly simplis-
tic political rhetoric, we are at war
without understanding what war
entails. We've led ourselves to erro-
neously believe that we show our
respect by cheering for America
but remain silent when faced with
too many deaths to comprehend.
Sound bites and gaffes now blot out
the deaths of young Americans in
our collective consciousness. That
is why we lack respect, and all of us
are guilty.
9/11 and it's
after-effects are
still newsworthy.
As I wrote in my column one year
ago, our generation has inherited a
seemingly endless war. This is why
Tuesday, on the anniversary of Sep-
tember 11th, I encourage everyone
to think deeply about the persis-
tence of the past: the consequenc-
es of 9/11 endure in the present.
Although those attacks occurred
more than one decade ago, they
continue to claim victims today.
The tragedy of 9/11 is not delimited
to history - it remains a current
event. To ignore its legacies, to turn
a blind eye to the lives our wars
continue to claim, would be tanta-
mount to ignorance.
For this, I challenge The Daily to
buck the trend in the national media
and more prominently feature sto-
ries on the American casualties of
war - particularly those related to
the state of Michigan and the Uni-
versity community. It is the respon-
sibility of this newspaper to inform
the student body. If we are to offer
genuine respect to those serving
abroad, as we claim to, let's begin by
building awareness at home among
the leaders of tomorrow.

At the University of Michigan, returning
students register for classes in the spring, and
incoming freshmen register at their orientation
sessions during the summer or early fall. Stu-
dents may register for 12 to 18 credit hours at
normal student rates and are permitted to add
or drop courses for two weeks after the firstday
of classes. However, students at some universi-
ties spend the first weeks of school in a "shop-
ping period" and attend any and all classes that
interest them. Students then go through the
normal registration after "shopping" for their
favorite professors, topics and class structures.
The term "course shopping" has a connota-
tion that promotes exploration and experimen-
tation. This policy gives students the time and
opportunity to discover what interests them
without restrictions. Students can step out of
their comfort zones and see if something unex-
pected interests them.
As many freshmen and undecided stu-
dents sift through hundreds of courses and
a difficult-to-navigate registration process,
many are understandably overwhelmed.
Deciding on a life path is a stressful process,
and the finality of pre-registration makes it
that much more nerve-wracking. A shopping
period would allow unsure students to get a
better feel for what they do and do not like,

which would lead to less "buyer's remorse,"
especially considering the price of textbooks
and other class materials.
If students had the opportunity to shop
for classes, the instructors would have a
greater incentive to make class introduc-
tions interesting and competitive. This would
deter instructors from the typical introduc-
tory classes, filled with syllabi and review.
Instead, students would get a feel for the
material right away and be able to quickly
determine their interest level. The scramble
to find the best professor before registering
wouldn't be as important and students could
enroll in the most appealing class.
Implementing a shopping week at the Uni-
versity is beneficial for students in several
ways. It promotes exploring new subjects
and branching out of comfort zones without
negative repercussions. Freshmen and unde-
cided undergraduates would especially ben-
efit from this policy, and all students would
benefit as teachers would be more inclined to
make course material interesting. Ultimate-
ly, a shopping week at the University would
allow students to truly enjoy the classes
they've chosen, instead of wasting time and
money on subjects that only seemed interest-
ing in the course guide.

'Illegitimate' arguments

In the aftermath of August's inexcusable,
irrational and horrendously offensive "legiti-
mate rape"gaffe uttered by U.S. Rep. Todd Akin
(the hopefully soon-to-be ex-Republican candi-
date for U.S. Senate in Missouri), I, as a Repub-
lican, have found myself in the unfortunate
position of being vulnerable to guilt by asso-
ciation. My peers may unfairly conclude that I
must somehow sympathize with the extremist
ideology of some fringe politician who happens
to associate with the same political party. In
lieu ofthe well-deserved backlash against Todd
Akin and the undeserved stigma that some of
my fellow college Republicans may be facing, I
find it necessary to clarify some essential facts
that may be lost in all of the hype.
As soon as Rep. Akin's comments went viral,
the Republican establishment dropped him
like a hot potato, as they well should have. The
National Republican Senatorial Committee
promptly pulled his funding, both Mitt Romney
and Paul Ryan called for his withdrawal from
the Senate race, Republican Sen. Scott Brown
of Massachusetts, himself a victim of sexual
abuse as a child and the father of two daugh-
ters, railed against Akin's gaffe as "outrageous,
inappropriate, and wrong" and demanded his
resignation from the race. In short, probably
99 percent of Republicans condemned Akin for
misrepresentingthe values of his party.
The swift condemnation delivered by the
party establishment most visibly rebukes the
idea that reasonable Republicans would sym-
pathize with, or even cover up for, a radical and
severely misinformed beliefheld by one of their
own. While I'm at it, I find it necessary to men-
tion a Democratic politician whose infamously
shameful acts of infidelity were covered up
and overlooked by members of his own party
who are now railing against Akin for offending
women. Does the name Bill Clinton ringa bell?
Slick Willie, perhaps? I digress.
For those who may be emboldened after
recent events to label all Republicans as out
of touch on women's issues and who may feel
that the reaction by the party establishment
was merely political damage control and not
heartfelt condemnation, I present some more
food for thought. Adding to Senators Kay Bai-

ley Hutchison of Texas, Lisa Murkowski of
Alaska and Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe
of Maine - all three of whom are pro-choice
- the 2010 election cycle saw the election of
.New Hampshire's first female Republican
senator, Kelly Ayotte. Further, at the state
level, three of the 15 newly-elected Repub-
lican governors in 2010 were women. This
includes the nation's first ever Latina gov-
ernor, Susana Martinez of New Mexico, and
the first female governor of South Carolina,
Nikki Haley, who is currently the country's
youngest governor as well as the second ever
Indian-American governor.
These new leaders are visionaries and pio-
neers, both for their party and for the rest
of the country. They represent the future of
the Republican Party, rebuff the notions that
Republicans as a whole are out of touch with
women, and thatstrong,talented women can't
also be drawn to core Republican values: hard
work, personal responsibility, entrepreneur-
ship, equality of opportunity, individualism,
smaller and smarter government, etc.
Todd Akin does not represent mainstream
Republicans, nor do the vast majority of
Republicans and Americans sympathize with
his statement. I would hope that my peers
would not be so judgmental as to label all
Republicans bigots simply because they iden-
tify with the same broad-tent, pluralistic con-
glomeration known as the Republican Party.
Contrary to current hype, women's issues
are not exclusively Democratic issues. Being
a Republican can mean a number of differ-
ent things to each individual, as can being
a Democrat. I myself am pro-gay marriage,
as are a small but growing number of fis-
cally conservative, socially moderate-to-
liberal Republicans. One bad apple cannot
and should not spoil the bunch. After all, just
because Bill Clinton made shameful personal
decisions that tarnished his reputation and
undermined his marriage doesn't mean I
believe that my Democratic friends condone
or accept his behavior simply because they're
Democrats.

When I return home on breaks
from school, my 14-year-old brother
gives me a bear hug, and then imme-
diately proceeds to offer a descrip-
tion of the newest technology, from
Apple's next iPhone to Samsung's
newest tablet. When I look at these
devices, I'm amazed by the advances
in technology and wonder at these
innovative ideas.
During my internship on Capi-
tol Hill this past summer, I learned
about the growing role of NASA in
America's economic competitive-
ness. Even though NASA has discon-
tinued launching men and women
into outer space, it plays an extreme-
ly important role in our economy.
NASA has been working to apply
space technologies to commercial
markets. Using their advances to
spark innovation in a stagnant global
economy may be the boost America
needs to get back on top.
Over the past several decades,
NASA has been looking to improve
American economic competitive-
ness through its Small Business
Innovation Research/Small Business
Technology Transfer programs. As
a result, NASA has sponsored over
1,000 technology projects and has
invested billions of dollars in proj-
ects across the country, including
$28 million in the state of Michigan
in 2011.
There have been many examples
ofthese products, also known as
"spinoffs." NASA has invested in
projects in numerous industries,
including medical care and sports
performance. For example, at the
Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, doc-
tors and nurses have been using a
portable ultrasound machine that is

based on technologies licensed from
NASA. This device allows anyone to
send medical imaging to experts for
examination.
NASA has also attempted to use
its technology to tackle looming
environmental challenges. With
solar technology subject to much
public scrutiny since the Solyndra
scandal in 2011, NASA has quietly
been working with GreenField Solar,
a company that has been develop-
ing PhotoVolt solar technologies
in Cleveland. GreenField Solar has
created a solar energy concentrator
that can track, capture and concen-
trate the sun's rays 900 times better
than a normal concentrator, which
dramatically improves the efficiency
of the solar panel, according to Dr.
Mason Peck, the chief technologist
of NASA.
As a result of NASA's efforts,
America has seen great benefits at a
low cost. According to a study con-
ducted by Georgetown and NASA,
out of the 187 projects assessed, 76
percent reported productivity and
efficiency improvements for the
companies. 62 percentof the projects
produced quantitative benefits, such
as improving or saving lives, along
with job and revenue benefits. The
technologies generated about 1,600
jobs and $532 million in revenue. In
the cases in which data were collect-
ed about productivity and efficiency
improvements, companies reported
total savings of $4.13 billion.
With these benefits in mind, this is
the future of the American economy.
While the recovery continues to lag
and the federal government remains
deeply indebted, Congress and the
White House should not stop fund-

ing NASA's efforts. These projects
will contribute to provide revenues
for companies and new industries in
which America can be a global lead-
er. President Obama's 2013 budget
allocates $17.7 billion to NASA. This
number is quite small when com-
pared to the possible return on the
investment made.
If there is any hope in makingthis
work, America must invest in and
rework its education system, partic-
ularly in math and science. Accord-
ing to a 2009 study conducted by the
Organization for Economic Coop-
eration and Development, Ameri-
can students rank 25th out of 34
industrialized countries in math and
17th in science. Not only that, fewer
students are studying math and sci-
ence in the highest levels of educa-
tion. The biggest companies today,
including Apple, have said that they
have moved their production cen-
ters and offices overseas in part due
to the fact that there are not enough
skilled workers in the U.S.
NASA has made an attempt to
solve this problem by providing
internships and scholarships for stu-
dents interested in math and science.
These solutions will help bring jobs
back to the U.S., but America must
be willing to cultivate the greatest
innovators of the world. NASA must
play a large role in spurring that
innovation, though it will be up to
students to make it possible. Ten or
20 years from now, I'm hoping that I
can still hear my little brother tell me
he and his classmates are designing
tomorrow's products, not just read-
ing about them.

DEFENSE
From Page 1A
537 rushing yards allowed - an
astounding figure considering
that Michigan gave up a total of
1,712 yards on the ground all of
last season. (Slightly over three
times the amount that the defense
has allowed in just two games so
far this year:)
The opponents certainly have
something to do with it. Alabama
is essentially a minor league NFL
team, and-the Crimson Tide is
likely to roll over everyone it faces
this year.
And Air Force presented a
unique challenge, due to the com-
plexity of its triple-option offense
and the breakneck tempo with
which it operates.
Fifth-year senior safety Jordan
Kovacs, a team captain and the
leader of the defense, acknowl-
edged the unit wasn't up to par on
Saturday. But he also was quick
to point to the problems posed by
the system the Wolverines were
up against.
"Obviously, we gave up some
points," Kovacs said. "We didn't
get ourselves off the field at times
when we really needed to, but at
the end of the day, we're not going
to see an offense like this again."
Last season, the improvement
of the defense after two years
of absolute woe was a revela-
tion. Defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison appeared to be noth-
ing short of a miracle worker. It
was almost assumed, then, that

Irwin also had warm words for
Bridget McCormack, a University
law professor and one of the Dem-
ocratic candidates for the State
Supreme Court nominated at the
convention.
"She's one of the Supreme Court
candidates I've been most excited
about in my entire life, frankly,
because here you have somebody
who's not just from our commu-
nity but someone who's done great
things in our community," he said.
Irwin said McCormack's
involvement in the Innocence
Project, a group in the Law School
dedicated to exonerating innocent
people wrongly jailed, makes her
an even more attractive candidate.
"Sometimes mistakes are
made," Irwin said. "And it's people
like Bridget Mary McCormack
and the folks who she works with
- the students that she works
with at the Law School - that
make sure that those mistakes are
ferreted out ... and make sure that
justice is done."
LSA junior Matt Jones, co-
chair of the state of Michigan Col-
lege Republicans and the state of
Michigan director of Students for

Mattison would be able to work
his magic again and keep things
humming despite the loss of three
starters along the defensive line.
The early returns say other-
wise.
But growing pains along the
defensive line were to be expected
given the inexperience there. The
more troublesome part of Satur-
day's game was the play of the
linebacking corp, which consisted
wholly of returning starters.
Redshirt sophomore linebacker
Jake Ryan, the new recipient of
Bennie Oosterbaan's reinstated
legacy jersery, made some big
plays, especially late, but also
seemed out of position at times.
Fifth-year senior Kenny Demens.
and sophomore Desmond Mor-
gan, on the other hand, were
much less consistent, often unable
to diagnose the complex plays
that Air Force ran.
It reached the point that the
latter two were replaced by a pair
of true freshmen, Joe Bolden and
James Ross III. Michigan coach
Brady Hoke explained their play-
ing time - as well as the appear-
ances of several more freshmen
on Saturday - by talking about
their talent and his desire to keep
everyone fresh.
That's a dubious explanation
- defensive line is one thing, but
in a tightgame, most coaches are
reticent to rotate linebackers. It
makes one wonder how confident
the coaches really are in some
players that were thought to be
reliable options.
Given this staff's track record,

you would expect the defense to
improve by leaps and bounds as
the season goes on. The best way
to get better performances out
of inexperienced players is to get
them experience, and that will
continue to accrue. It's possible
that, by the end of the season,
these first two games will be
outliers.
And there was a silver lining
from Saturday. When it absolutely
needed to, the defense came up
with stops. Michigan forced a
turnover on downs when Air
Force was driving to tie or take
the lead late in the fourth quarter,
and then repeated the feat on the
Falcons' final drive of the game.
But those were two bright
spots on an otherwise dismal day
defensively.
"I would say there is a unique-
ness to the offense and the
schemes," Hoke said. "But at the
same time, I think we're a work in
progress."
The defining sound from Satur-
day was that groan, hnd the defin-
ing sentiment was worry.
Improvement should be
expected, and Kovacs said he
foresees as much.
But right now, as his com-
ments show, even Hoke knows
that unless the defense comes
together, a Big Ten champion-
ship - the only way to prevent
this season from being a failure,
in the coach's eyes - is out of the
question.

"We are an established non-
profit, not just a student orga-
nization," Fishman said. "We're
actually insured to be able to
sell on campus which is a great
opportunity to get healthy and
affordable alternatives available
on a student budget."
Frog Holler, an organic farm
in Brooklyn, Mich., sources
food to the co-op and their
stand, according to LSA junior
Stacey Matlen, the co-op's
finance coordinator. Eventually
they hope to supply local, farm-
grown produce to students.
"We would've originally liked
to have started out sourcing
from local farmers, but there are
complications with health codes
and certification necessary for
the University so we buy in bulk
from Frog Holler," Matlen said.
Last spring, Matlen applied

about 140 students. However,
she noted she was disappoint-
ed that the attendance did not
match the group's 2008 mass
meeting numbers, which were
nearly two times Sunday's
attendance.
Leaders of the College Repub-
licans said they were similarly
content with a standing-room-
only crowd that came out to the
Michigan League at their meet-
ing Sunday evening.
For the College Republicans,
the attendance and fervor to
deny President Barack Obama a
second term in office is indica-
tive of the group's collective
confidence that Republican
presidential nominee Mitt Rom-
ney will win in Michigan.
Citing a Public Policy Poll-
ing poll released last week that
showed that Obama holds a sev-
en-point lead in the state, Matt
Jones, state director of Students
for Romney, said the College
Republicans could help the
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., native
win the state.
"It really comes down to our
ground game, and the (College
Republicans) are a big part of
that ground game," Jones told
students at the meeting. "So
really, you can make a differ-
ence, and because Michigan's
a swing state for the first time
since 1988, we can influence the
entire national election."
Jones added: "And of course,
I don't even need to say, it'll feel
great to knock Barack Obama
out of office."

a successful pilot day last spring
in the Chemistry Building, the
food stand moved to its new
home on the sidewalk of North
University Avenue.
"Our pilot day sold produce
on a smaller scale and it was
fairly successful," Matlen said.
"We're now at a much better
location and being outside while
the weather is still nice gives us
more exposure."
LSA freshman Humphrey
Akujobi said the location was
particularly appealing to him,
since he has his own kitchen
and is able to use the produce to
cook meals.
"I think it's really cool that
they have fresh produce and
it's really convenient because
I live on North Campus," Aku-
jobi said. "I have an apartment
with a kitchen so I would have
to walk far to get to the grocery
store and this is just so much
more convenient."
LSA freshman Angela Huang
event, LSA junior Russ Hayes,
internal vice chair of the Col-
lege Republicans, said the
desire to remove Obama from
office may have boosted meet-
ing attendance, which he said
was the best' in the last three
years.
"Why do we want to keep
going for another four years?"
Hayes asked. "We want to try
something different. We want
to try real, actual change. Why
don't we see some real results?"
Earlier in the day, the Uni-
versity's chapter of the Col-
lege Democrats touted Obama's
accomplishments, claiming his
political triumphs are the rea-
son the upcoming presidential
election is exceptionally signifi-
cant.
U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.) also spoke at the College
Democrats meeting, along with
state Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) and state Sen. Rebekah
Warren (D-Ann Arbor).
In his address to prospective
members, Dingell recited a line
that Vice President Joe Biden
used with supporters at a late-
August event in Detroit.
"General Motors is alive, and
Osama bin Laden is dead," Ding-
ell recited.
Dingell also discussed the
Affordable Care Act, student
loans and the automotive indus-
try bailout of General Motors
and Chrysler.
Fran Brennan - Michigan
director of Working for Amer-
ica, a labor organization for
working families - also spoke
at the event, and said this year's
election could be a turning
point in the country's history,
underscoring the importance of

said she was most excited about
the accessibility to fresh pro-
duce because it invoked feelings
of being back home.
"It's awesome that you can
get fresh produce here on cam-
pus because I love just eating
raw peppers or a huge head
of lettuce right' out of the bag
sometimes," Huang said.
Though it's only a weekly
food stand, the organization has
goals to have a permanent food
cart and eventually a storefront.
"Also, one of our goals is to
have people realize the impact
of what they eat in terms of their
own bodies and their communi-
ties," Fishman said.
Matlet said that though the
group is looking to expand and
increase its efforts, the Ann
Arbor Student Food Co-op is
content with its progress.
"Honestly, right now, I am
happy we can get our produce
out here," Matlen said. "To be
able to provide fresh, afford-
able, produce on campus is a
large step since its origin just a
year ago."
young voters.
"This is the time," Brennan
said. "If you don't get engaged
this time, it really is serious,
because this is a crossroads. It's
going to determine what your
life is going to be for years to
come."
She urged students to get out
to the polls, emphaszing that the
youth vote is critical to Obama's
re-election efforts.
"You in this room can be the
difference between whether
we are celgbrating on Novem-
ber 6th a new era with Barack
Obama, or we are not celebrat-
ing and we are fearful about
what the next four years will
bring," Brennan said.
At the College Republicans
meeting, students discussed
campaign efforts for the Repub-
lican candidates for the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents,
including Dan Horning and Rob
Steele. Leaders also discussed
the group's structure and
upcoming activities.
The major constituency
among students at both meet-
ings was freshmen, who said
they attended to influence the
outcome of the election and be
more politically active.
Engineering freshman Phil
Brenz said he attended the Col-
lege Republicans' meeting to aid
Romney's election efforts. He
said he felt like an "outsider" at
the University before the meet-
ing,.but afterward felt enthusi-
astic.
"I feel pretty energized, and
like we can make a difference in
the campaign for the fall."

Romney, attended the Republican
state convention as a delegate for
Kalamazoo, Mich.
Jones said he was pleased with
the Republicans' nomination of
Steele and Horning because, of
their past involvement with the
University and specifically with
the College Republicans.
"Steele and Horning both, we
have a history with working on
various different projects," Jones
said. "I guess you could saythey're
the students' regents because they
really have worked closely with us
over the years."
Jones also notpdthathe enjoyed
the change in political climate
fromAnnArborto the convention.
"Livingin Ann Arbor, one of the
most liberal places in the country
... we are indeed the minority," he
said. "I think being around people
that are ready to elect Mitt really
gets us fired up."
LSA senior Rachel Jankowski,
chair of the University's chapter of
College Republicans, volunteered
at the convention. She said while
the convention was informational
for her, it will also be beneficial to
those who couldn't attend.
"We also wanted to make sure
we were educated on the issues so
that we could come back and teach
our peers about it," she said.

Jankowski added that despite
the higher average age of conven-
tion attendees, gaps across age
groups were successfully bridged.
"I truly enjoyed being around
so many like-minded energized
people," she said. "They tend to be
an older crowd at the convention,
(and) they were excited to see that
young people were interested in
the party."
LSA senior Sean Walser, vice
president of the Student Asso-
ciation of Michigan, also attended
the Democratic Michigan con-
vention, which he described- as
diverse, yet focused.
"I think it was cool to see so
many people in one room work-
ing on a lot of different issues but
really united behind one common
cause," he said.
Walser stressed the impor-
tance of students taking part in
the nomination of the University's
Board of Regent candidates. He
said the election process is read-
ily overlooked by most people,
but remains especially important
because there is no primary elec-
tion for regent candidates.
"People don't realize that this
campus is getting run essentially
by those individuals that are nomi-
nated at the party convention," he
said.

Chicago teachers go on strike for first time in 25 years

26,000 protesters
expected to picket
today
CHICAGO (AP) - Chicago
teachers went on strike Mon-
day for the first time in 25 years
after their union and district
officials failed to reach a con-
tract agreement despite intense
weekend negotiations that the
union said were productive but
still failed to adequately address
issues such as job security and
teacher evaluations.
The two sides were not far
apart on compensation, but were
on other issues, including health
benefits - teachers want to keep
what they have now - and a new
teacher evaluation system based
partly on students' standardized
test scores, Chicago Teachers
Union President Karen Lewis
said.
"This is a difficult decision
and one we hoped we could have
avoided," she said. "We must do
things differently in this city if
we are to provide our students
with the education they so
rightfully deserve."
Mayor Rahm Emanuel con-
demned the union's decision,
and said the negotiations could
be resolved if the two sides kept
talking, "given how close we
are."
"This is not a strike I wanted,"
Emanuel said. "It was a strike of
choice ... it's unnecessary, it's
avoidable and it's wrong. "
More than 26,000 teachers

and support staff were expected
to hit the picket lines early Mon-
day, while the school district
and parents carried out plans
for keeping nearly 400,000 stu-
dents safe and occupied while
classes remain empty in the
coming days in the nation's third
largest school district.
Both Emanuel and union offi-
cials have much at stake. The
walkout comes at a time when
unions and collective bargaining
by public employees have come
under criticism in many parts
of the country, and all sides are
closely monitoring who might
emerge with the upper hand in
the Chicago dispute.
The timing also may be inop-
portune for Emanuel, a former
White House chief of staff whose
city administration is wrestling
with a spike in murders and
shootings in some city neighbor-
hoods and who just agreed to
take a larger role in fundraising
for President Barack Obama's
re-election campaign.
As the strike deadline
approached, parents spent Sun-
day worrying about how much
their children's education might
suffer and where their kids will
go while they're at work.
School officials said they will
open more than 140 schools
between 8:30 a.m. and 12:30
p.m. so children can eat lunch
and breakfast in a district
where many students receive
free meals. The district asked
community organizations to
provide additional programs
for students, and a number of

churches, libraries and other
groups plan to offer day camps
and other activities. But it's not
clear how many families will
send their children to the added
programs.
"They're going to lose learn-
ing time," said Beatriz Fierro,
whose daughter is in the fifth
grade on the city's Southwest
Side. "And if the whole after-
noon they're going to be free, it's
bad. Of course you're worried."
Eric Ferrer, a cook, said his
children can stay home Monday
with his wife, who works in a
store. But if the strike goes more
than one day, they would have a
problem - one that he sees no
way to solve.
"My wife is off tomorrow, (so)
we can keep them at home," said
Ferrer, as he sat in a McDonald's
restaurant on the city's South-
west Side with his wife and their
8-year-old son and 3-year-old
daughter. "She works the next
day (and) so do I."
School board President David
Vitale first announced Sunday
night that talks had broken off,
despite the school board offer-
ing what he called a fair and
responsible contract that would
cover four years and meet most
of the union's demands. He said
the talks with the union had been
"extraordinarily difficult."
Emanuel said the district had
offered the teachers a 16 percent
pay raise over four years, dou-
bling an earlier offer.
Lewis said she would not pri-
oritize the issues, saying that
they all were important to teach-

ers.
That included concern over
a new evaluation that she said
would be based too heavily on
students' standardized test
scores, which she said would
be unfair to teachers because
it could not adequately account
for outside factors that affect
student performance, including
poverty, violence and homeless-
ness.
She said the evaluations could
result in 6,000 teachers losing
their jobs within two years.
City officials said they did not
believe that was true, but said the
union would not tell them how
they came to that conclusion.
Emanuel said the evaluation
would not count in the first year,
as teachers and administrators
worked out any kinks. Schools
CEO Jean-Claude Brizard said
the evaluation was mandated
by state law but "was not devel-
oped to be a hammer," but to help
teachers get better.
Emanuel said the union
should have postponed the strike
because an agreement is close.
He also said his negotiatingteam
would be available all night if the
union was willing to talk, but
Lewis said negotiations would
resume Monday.
The strike is the latest flash-
point in a very public and often
contentious battle between the
mayor and the union.
When he took office last year,
Emanuel inherited a school dis-
trict facing a $700 million bud-
get shortfall. Not long after, his
administration rescinded 4 per-

cent raises for teachers. He then raises in exchange for lengthen-
asked the union to reopen its ing the school day for students by
contract and accept 2 percent pay 90 minutes. The union refused.

Finding the ine art
in partying

" his is a party, Anna,"
Sara said as she shim-
mied a sparkly purple
skirt over her hips. "The more
glitter, the better."
And judg-

Sara's entire

"It's about SAOSKA

the art," Sara
continued, spraying body mist in
her hair. "The art of partying and
having a good time."
I never take anything Sara
says seriously, and it's not only
because she owns more sequins
than you'd find in a craft store.
But why not? There is an art to
partying. And why would that
art be any less valid?
Freshman girls pile into
someone's dorm room, trading
clothes and make-up tips while
getting ready. They straighten
their hair and try on eight dif-
ferent crop tops before settling
on a light pink one with a black
skirt and sky-high heels. They
continually ask one another if
their eyes are painted too dark
or their lips too red. They ques-
tion every strand of hair. And
when they're ready, they play
pump-up music to be fun and
happy and flirty. This is the art
of partying - an almost theater-
like evolution of girls into The

Failed 'Revo]

JJ. Abrams' new
cookie-cutter
drama is stale

Let's just get the obligatory

lution really shouldn't be tele-
vised.

and execution. That is to say, it's
a derivatively plotted, clumsily
delivered package of would-be
soft-sci-fi thriller that fails to
thrill and whose science col-
lapses under even cursory scru-
tiny. And this time, there aren't
even any dinosaurs.
"Revolution" opens with its
presentation of concept, which
it almost immediately botches.

mixed drink and sloppily
g to some guy she just met
her long list of unhappy
tic escapades? Party foul.

The premise of the show is a
world in which electricity no
longer exists because of the
machinations of some mysteri-
ous paragovernmental agency.
We are introduced to someone
who works for aforementioned
agency. He warns his family to
prepare for the apocalypse, and
then boom! Apocalypse! All the
electricity is gone, planes start
falling out of the sky, etc. Cut to
fifteen years later.
That this is a well-worn and
silly excuse to get people fight-
ing with swords and crossbows
in the ruins of recognizable cit-
ies is almost beside the point.
The offensive thing about
"Revolution" is how little effort
it expends to arrive there, or
to explore the concept once it.
does. Seeing the deterioration
of modern society into the main
setting of "Revolution," where
horse-riding militia groups con-
trol everything and there is no
toilet paper, might have been an
interesting way to introduce the
world with a flourish. Instead,
we are just offered the world
wholesale and asked to take it
or leave it, with no explanation
as to how we got there. With this
uncompelling premise, leav-
ing viewers in the dark simply
encourages them to stay away.
Sadly, the would-be high,
concept nonsense may be the
most palatable part of the show.
There's little to say about any of
the characters in "Revolution,"
except that they're not really
characters so much as newly
unwrapped archetypes freshly
delivered from Tropes 'R'- Us.
The cast is mostly unknown,
with the exception of Billy
Burke from "Twilight" playing
a gruff loner antihero. There's
also Giancarlo Esposito, a long
way down from "Breaking Bad,"

Lution'
trying his darndest with a part
that seems to be aiming for
Christoph Waltz in "Inglourious
Basterds" but not hitting much
of anything. Esposito earned a
lot of credit on "Breaking Bad,"
but even he seems stymied by
the featureless villain he's been
handed to animate, slipping in
and out of a weirdly off-South-
ern accent and appearing as not
entirely in control of his face
instead of coldly menacing.
Shows like this need to nail
the visuals to be even slightly
credible, and here "Revolution"
fails again. The concept of the
human world allowed to disinte-
grate opens the door for poten-
tially incredible effects, but
every shot of ruined cities and
recognizable but broken down
artifacts of our age simply looks
like CGI. Overly harsh artificial
lighting is completely counter-
productive to the conceit of a
world without electricity, and
gives the show an anesthetic feel
that serves it poorly. The action
sequences are just as tepid, and
the showrunners seem deter-
mined to challenge thh record
for how many times people get
shot in the back unexpectedly
during a fight.
The only element of "Revo-
lution" that could potential-
ly redeem it is the excellent
Giancarlo Esposito (albeit
excellent in other vehicles), but
there's no reason to sit through
the rest of this drivel for a few
moments of Gus Fring, espe-
cially given that his part, like
everything else in the pilot, is so
poorly written. "Revolution" is
ultimately a paint-by-numbers
show that fails to bring anything
conceptually innovative to the
table, and then fails to explore
its unoriginal concept either
thoroughly or well.

Cooper can't express
himself in 'Words'

SAMUEL GOLDWYN FILMS
"Will you give me an Oscar?"
'Frank'facesfear

Old age, friendship
tackled in star-
studded sci-fi film
By ADITI MISHRA
Daily Arts Writer
The term "old age" elicits a
variety of emotional responses
in those of us who aren't quite

probably the ***
most univer-
sally prominent. Robot and
And in an hon-
est and loveable Frank

age, "Robot and'
Frank" shows Samuel Goldwyn
us why. Films
Based in the
near future, in which vehicles
smaller than Smart cars roam
the streets and political debates
shift from human slavery to robot
slavery, "Robot and Frank" tells
the story of an elderly man, Frank
(Frank Langella, "Unknown"),
who's barely coping with the
timeless nature of loneliness and
age. Frank leads a life devoid of
the technological advancements
of his time, choosing to embrace
books instead of tablets and
refusing to use robots for house-
hold help. In a predictable state of
affairs, he's losinghis memory, his
children are too far away to visit
often and he has no hobbies to
keep his mind occupied.
But unlike today, the future
seems to have a cure for his

all-too-familiar predicament.
Frank's son, Hunter (James
Marsden, "30 Rock"), buys him
a robot "butler" (voiced, impec-
cably, by Peter Sarsgaard, "Green
Lantern") to help with house-
hold tasks and keep Frank in
good health. Barring initial aver-
sion to this technological intrud-
er, Frank develops an inevitable
friendship with the newest occu-
pant of his house - a friendship
that grows deeper and more
human as Frank rediscovers his
passions and once again finds
purpose in his life.
There's something to be said
about first-time director-writer
pair Jake Schreier and Christo-
pher D. Ford's decision to base
this film in the future. Frank's
avid dislike of technology only
adds humor and depth to the
development of his friendship
with Robot. These distinctly dif-
ferent species soon find common
ground in Frank's rediscovery
of old habits - as an ex-thief, he
challenges himself to overcome
the technological advances in
security systems with the help of
his own technology, Robot.
But Schreier's genius plan isn't
to evoke humor from a strange
relationship or joy from a man's
rediscovery of himself, though it
unequivocally does. Its aim is to
use this unusual companionship
to elicit the most humane fears of
old age. He combats Frank's lone-
liness with a program designed to
do anything it takes to keep Frank
healthy, even if that entails thiev-
ery. But the film never fails to
remind the audience that it's not

the robot, but the mere presence
of company that gives Frank the
confidence to be himself: In his
case, that entails asking out the
librarian (Susan Sarandon, "Jeff,
Who Lives at Home") and engag-
ing in a heated books-vs-technol-
ogy squabble with the narcissistic
library owner (Jeremy Strong,
"The Romantics").
For a low-budget independent
film, "Robot and Frank" has an
enviable cast at its disposal. Lan-
gella, as Frank, is masterful and
poignant in his character's pro-
gression from lostto found. Mars-
den and Liv Tyler ("The Ledge")
as Frank's children are almost
always on par with the power-
house who plays their father. And
Sarandon, while having a role too
short to display her talents, gives
every scene an impressive boost
of dry humor and undisguised
humility.
A bit slow to start, the film
delves too long into Frank's fad-
ing memory and inability to care
for himself. But when it gets down
to business, "Robot and Frank"
shows a captivating flare for cap-
turing Frank's changing attitude,
while subtly hinting at the immi-
nent end of an unsustainable rela-
tionship between a human and
robot that, nonetheless, drives
Frank closer to his family.
With potency and casual grace,
this film shows that self-discov-
ery toward the end of one's life
isn't simply about the self, but
about the people and relation-
ships - human or technological
in nature - that form the roots of
one's identity.

Cooper's nose for mediocre
scripts strikes again with his
most recent film, "The Words."
But somehow, Cooper is not the
only significant reason "The
Words" is an exasperatingly slow
torture-fest of a movie. Sure, the
confused nature of Cooper's por-

feel, but what it all boils down
to is heavy-handed direction
and a script so full of itself that
it insists on dragging the viewer
through the most insignificant
plot details in a failed attempt to
come across as complex.
To be fair, "The Words" does
have a somewhat interesting
plotline involving a story within

up at a book reading by well-

tells the story of a struggling

Robinson hits the
ground running,
speeds past Air
Force at Big House
By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
For Denard Robinson, the hole
opened up like a blast of fresh air.
For Michigan fans, it must have
felt like the same.
The run was a familiar sight,
and welcomed, too - the No. 19
Michigan football team barely
escaped with a 31-25 win over Air
Force on Saturday.
It was just Michigan's second

offensive play of the game, a read
option - Robinson's bread and
butter. Robinson kept, and with
a stutter, a cut and a juke, he was
off, like a rush of wind, 79-yards
untouched to the end zone.
Robinson even blew past his
speedy teammate, redshirt junior
Jeremy Gallon, on the play. Back
on the bench, panting from the
chase, Gallon joked that Robinson
needed to slow down.
"Not to be cocky or anything,"
Robinson said, "but once I get in
front of everybody and I see the
end zone, I don't think I'm being
caught from behind."
On Michigan's first play of
the second half, Robinson did it
again, with a 58-yard scamper.
Only this time, he fittingly added

his own personal flair - 'Shoe-
lace' ran the last 40yards without
his right shoe.
This is what Michigan football
looks like, at least with Robinson,
the senior, as the quarterback.
For better or worse, the Wolver-
ines live and die by the fortunes
of a blurred No. 16 jersey darting
across the field - with his shoe-
laces untied, of course.
This time, Robinson and his
receiving corps played the hero,
rescuing a shoddy defense from a
comeback loss. Michigan led the
entire game but needed a stop on
the Falcons' final drive to put Air
Force away.
"We're probably not going to
run thatdefense again," said fifth-

Jake Ryan didn't look himself
out there.
And with good reason. His
defensive tenacity and signa-
ture locks remained intact, but
the redshirt sophomore line-
backer had a new jersey number
in Michigan's 31-25 victory over
Air Force in the home opener on
Saturday.
The redshirt sophomore
linebacker was selected by the
Michigan coaching staff to don
the No. 47 jersey in honor of
former player and coach Bennie
Oosterbaan - a newly minted
'Michigan Football Legend.' .
Ryan readily accepted the
number change, switching from
No. 90 to become the first Mich-
igan player to wear the No. 47
jersey since Oosterbaan gradu-
ated in 1928. Only one player -
Harlan Froemke (1924) - wore
the number at Michigan before
Oosterbaan, and Froemke never
joined the varsity squad.
In keeping with the tenor of
the recognition, Ryan led the
Wolverines with 11 tackles, a
tackle for loss and two pass
breakups.
Some of that success, he
admitted, could be chalked up
to the charge of representing
a Michigan great. To him, it's a
little more than just a number.

gan tested
the Golden Grizzlies' back line
early and often, and they were
rewarded with Murillo's fifth-
minute goal. Standing near the
edge of the 18-yard box, the
sophomore received a crisp pass
off of junior defender Shelina
Zadorsky's corner kick. Murillo
took a touch, looked up and fired
a sizzling shot past Oakland
goalkeeper Shannon Coley.
"It was awesome to have
finally scored a goal," Murillo
said. "It meant so much that we
were able to win off of it."
The victory was Michigan's
first win away from the U-M
Soccer Complex this season.
Despite numerous promis-
ing opportunities for both sides,
Murillo's goal proved to be'the
winner for the Wolverines, who
improved their record to 6-2.
Murillo almost scored again in
the second half, but Coley man-
aged to deflect the wicked head-
er over the bar.
Michigan coach Greg Ryan
recognized Murillo's talent
even as a freshman, starting her
in every game of the 2011 cam-
paign in which she was named
to the Big Ten All-Freshmen
team. Now that she has returned
from representing Mexico in the
under-20 women's World Cup in
Japan, Ryan said he was awedby
the young star.
"She's going to get a lot more
goals," Ryan said. "Honestly, I
don't see many college players
playing the way she is right now.

She's not playing like a college
student. She's playing like a pro."
The Wolvefines dominated
the Golden Grizzlies in the first
45 minutes of play. They pep-
pered Oakland's goalkeeper,
outshooting the opposition
13-1, and took fourcorner kicks.
Coley rejected shot after shot,
but couldn't prevent Murillo's
effort from reaching the back of
the net. After 90 minutes, Mich-
igan had taken 17 shots and nine
corner kicks.
Oakland didn't test Michi-
gan senior goalkeeper Haley
Kopmeyer until the second
half. When the Golden Griz-
zlies did get through to her, the
program's all-time saves leader
came up -big. In the 82nd min-
ute, a long cross into the box was
one-timed out of the air by Oak-
land midfielder Nicole DeLuca.
Diving toward the far post,
Kopmeyer corralled the short-
range shot without allowing a
rebound.
Five minutes later, DeLuca's
beautiful 25-yard strike almost
found the upper-90, but the ris-
ing shot sailed inches over.the
crossbar.
The Wolverines' 1-0 vic-
tory marks their fifth shutout
of the season, and second- in as
many games. Through its entire
eight-game non-conference
slate, Michigan allowed just
four goals; Zadorsky, one of the
Wolverines' defensive leaders,
praised the back line's effort.
"We worked hard as a unit,
with a lot of communication,"
Zadorsky said. "We executed
pretty well."
Ryan praised Michigan's
defense as the deciding factor in
such a close game.
"The defense held us togeth-
er today," he said. "The team
defense was great."
The Wolverines look to
remain undefeated at home
when they open the conference
schedule against Indiana on
Saturday.

his gaze across the room before
answering.
"I feel like every kid has a
dream," Gardner began. "My
dream i§ to play quarterback at
the University of Michigan and
go onto the next level to play
quarterback. If that opportunity
presents itself, we'll have to cross
that bridge when we come to it."
In 11 months, we'll be discuss-
ing a true quarterback battle at
Michigan, something we haven't
seen since Denard Robinson vs.
Tate Forcier two years ago, when
Robinson earned the job and
exploded onto the national scene.
But who's going to be part of
this one? Gardner will be in the

discussion, at least at first, as
will sophomore Russell Bellomy
and five-star quarterback recruit
Shane Morris.
It's hard to predict. At one
point last season, Robinson said
Gardner "will probably be one of
the best quarterbacks in the Big
Ten, once he gets to start." But
will Gardner ever get that chance
to start a game as quarterback
at Michigan, or will his dream
be dashed and a future at wide
receiver realized?
I must not have a green thumb,
because I can't figure this Gard-
ner thing out.

The final goal of the game and
the only one of the second half
came when the Huskies' defense
over committed to Pereira, allow-
ing a quick pass to Opare, who
then tallied his second goal of the
day.
As a defender, Opare doesn't
usually find himself in scoring
position. Last season he managed
two goals, a feat he tied in just
this one game.
"Fabio played me a great ball
in the first half," Opare said. "My
only job was just to header the
ball on frame, .which is pretty
easy after great service. (For the)
second goal I just happened to be
at the right spot at the right time.
Fabio committed. the defender
and I basically just tapped it in. So
I give a lot of credit to my team-
mates who helped me score those
goals."
Also among the Wolverines'
top performers on the day was
Pereira with a goal and two
assists. The man-up scenario that
Michigan found themselves in
worked especially in the favor of
Pereira who, along with the other
midfielders, enjoyed plenty of
space to maneuver and distribute
the ball.
"I think that even if they didn't
go a man down we would still
have a good score at the end of the
day because we came out strong
and we had probably the best
performance of the year so far,"
Pereira said.

ROBINSON
From Page 1B
year senior safety Jordan Kovacs,
referring to the scheme built to
stop the triple-option. "That's
okay with me."
Down by six points, Air Force
took the ball at their own 20-yard
line with 2:45 remaining needing
a touchdown and an extra point
to lead. on fourth down, redshirt
sophomore linebacker Jake Ryan
burst through the line to deflect
the passing attempt to ice the
game.
Robinson shouldered the
offensive burden for Michigan
largely due to the ineffectiveness
of the running game. Redshirt
junior Fitzgerald Toussaint sput-
tered in his return from suspen-
sion, rushing for just seven yards
on eight carries.
"The non-Denard running
game - I guess that's what we're
gonna call it from now on - it
wasn't productive enough," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke. "I
don't think (Toussaint) ever had
a chance to getstarted. We didn't
block well enough."
As a result,.Robinson account-
ed for an unusually large portion
of the Michigan offense. His 426
total yards (218 on the ground
and 208 passing) were 99 percent
of the Wolverines' total offense,
not including kneel-downs. And
Robinson became the only player
in NCAA history to have three
separate games with at least 200
rushing and passing yards.
"What Denard did was good,"
said redshirt junior tackle Tay-
lor Lewan. "(But) we have to do
a better job of reestablishing the
line of scrimmage. It's going to
be tough for this team to be suc-
cessful if we can't do that as an
offensive line.
"Seven yards from the run-
ningback is awful."
,This season is likely the last
in Michigan's spread era, but
Saturday showed that Robinson
remains the star. When thebacks
struggled or the defense failed
to solve Air Force's mystifying
triple-option attack, it was Rob-
inson who countered.
After the Falcons' methodi-
cal opening drive stalled due to
a missed field goal, Robinson
struck with his opening touch-
down to open up a 7-0 lead. After
a Robinson tipped-ball intercep-
tion led to an Air Force touch-
down, he opened the half with
another long run for a score,
extending the lead to 21-10.
Air Force hung close for
much of the game, in great part
because Michigan's defense had
few answers for the Air Force
ground game, and then were
fooled through the rare passing
attempt. Air Force gained 417
total yards on the game, 290 on

the ground.
But the offense always kept
the game just out of reach. Inter-
ception notwithstanding, Robin-
son was unusually efficient with
his arm. Freshman tight end
Devin Funchess had a breakout
game, and Robinson found him
in the open field often. Funchess
caught a second-quarter touch-
down and finished with 106 total
yards on four receptions, all for
more than 20 yards each.
Robinson was 14 for 25 pass-
ing with two touchdowns,
including a pretty play-action
pass to junior receiver Devin
Gardner for an easy score in the
third quarter to pull ahead 28-17.
Gardner finished with five catch-
es for 63 yards..
The defense won the game
late, with a pair of big stops, but
Robinson, as usual, was the star.
That wasn't so in the opener,
when Robinson was bottled up
both by offensive coordinator Al
Borges (by design) and by him-
self (poor reads) against Ala-
bama. Yet if Robinson's inactivity
in the opener was an outlier, then
Saturday's game against Air
Force was the reversion to the
mean.
During the week, Borges
pronised that the game plan
would remain mostlyunchanged.
For some opponents, he said, the
defensive scheme will favor run-
ning Robinson. Others call for
more touches from the backfield
and more attempts through the
air. Still, he cautioned that the
amount of touches Robinson
enjoyed last season simply isn't
sustainable.
There was Robinson, though,
dashing, passing and powering
the Michigan offense almost
exclusively. He finished with 20
rushing attempts.
"I mean, if the running back's
running the ball 27 times, I
wouldn't mind," Robinson said.
"If I'm running the ball 27 times
I wouldn't mind. If we're throw-
ing the ball 27 times, it don't mat-
ter. Whatever it takes to win,
that's what we're going to do."
Back to the second play of the
game, the 79-yard touchdown,
Robinson kept to the right and
froze the outside linebacker,
unblocked by design, before
bursting through the hole. He
dashed left, off a second-level
block from fifth-year senior cen-
ter Elliott Mealer, side-stepped a
safety, and he was gone.
By the time Robinson reached
Air Force's 40-yard line, fifth-
year senior guard Patrick
Omameh thrust his hand in the
air.
With the ball in Robinson's
hands in the open field, there
was no other outcome but this:
he would score.

FUNCHESS

the highest point."
The freshman tight end caught
the first four passes of his career
on Saturday, and immediately
became considered both a reli-
able target and a big-play threat
for Robinson. Each of Funchess's
receptions were good for more
than 20 yards, and he finished
with 106 total.
The last Michigan tight end to
receive more than 100 yards in a
game was Jerame Tuman, who
caught five passes from Brian
Griese for 126 yards in the 1997
season opener against Colorado.
"I went out there, did my job
like I was supposed to, like I was
coached in practice to," Funch-
ess said. "I learned from Brandon
Moore, Mike Kwiatkowski, how
to get off some kinds of cover-
ages, and other things like that. It
helped me inthe game today."
Funchess saw increased

from 1925-28, and he received
All-American recognition five
times - three times for foot-
ball, twice for basketball. When
Oosterbaan graduated in1928, his

in large part to an MCL inju-
ry starting tight end Brandon
Moore sustained in last week's
matchup against Alabama. The
ligament isn't torn, though - just
stretched, as head coach Brady
Hoke put it - so Moore should be
ready for action soon.
Behind Moore, the tight end
position is relatively thin on
Michigan's roster. Fifth-year
senior and former walk-on Mike
Kwiatkowski, who was offered
a scholarship this fall, is slated
behind Moore on the depth chart.
And behind Kwiatkowski is the
freshmen duo of Funchess and
A.J. Williams.
Though Kwiatkowski is listed
ahead of Funchess on the depth
chart, it was clear on Saturday
that Funchess's athletic abilities
allowed him to see more game
action than his more experienced
teammate.
So far, Hoke likes what he
sees out of the Farmington Hills,
Mich. native.
"(Funchess is) a tall guy," Hoke
said. "He's rangy. He can run. The
number was taken out of circula-
tion while he remained at Mich-
gian as an assistant coach for the
men'sbasketball and football pro-
grams. After a nine-year stint as
head basketball coach, he became
head football coach in 1948.
Though Michigan still has
three other numbers to dole out
this year - former President Ger-

thing I like about him - he's not
afraid to block. He matches up
on strong safeties, matches up on
linebackers. It's kind of what you
look for - a guy like that."
Funchess mentioned after the
game that he recalls slipping up
on some of his blocking assign-
ments, and that part of his game
is a work in progress. But on Sat-
urday, the value he provided as a
new receiver for Robinson was
very clear.
By the end of the game, Rob-
inson's top two receivers were
Funchess and former quarter-
back Devin Gardner, who explic-
itly said after the game that he
still considers himself a quarter-
back first.
Those are slim pickings for
Robinson, who appreciates
Funchess's emergence.
"He's one of the guys who
always made plays in practice,
and we knew through our fall
camp we were going to use him,"
Robinson said. "His number was
calledbecause people went down.
He played a heck of a game."
ald Ford (48), Ron Kramer (87)
and the Wistert brothers (11) -
but Hoke felt the first was an easy
choice.
"From a character standpoint
and a standpoint of how he goes
about his business everyday,
there wasn't a better (pick) than
to have Jake represent Bennie,"
Hoke said.

LOOKING GOOD

FRESHMAN TIGHT END DEVIN
FUNCHESS: Playing in the place
of injured tight end Brandon
Moore, Funchess had a historically
dynamic breakout game. Funchess
caught four passes, all for more
than 20 yards, and finished with
106 yards and a touchdown. He
became the first ever Michigan
freshman tight end to record a 100-
yard receiving game and the first
tight end to receive 100 yards in a
game since 1997. On his touchdown
grab, he bailed out Robinson's
underthrow by out-leaping the
defensive back to win the ball.

DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR GREG
MATTISON: In two games, the
Michigan defense has allowed
66 points. The Wolverines didn't
allow that many points until week
six last year. And the 25 points
surrendered to Air Force would
have been higher if not for a missed
field goal and a failed fake field
goal attempt. Air Force confounded
the defense for much of Saturday.,
and dominated time of possession
with an absurd 90 plays. Even
though the Falcons are a run-heavy
team, allowing 290 yards on the
ground is never a good thing.
