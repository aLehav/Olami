Provost tackles
questions on
tuition, economic
diversity
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
University Provost Philip
Hanlon spoke about financial aid
and University affordability to a
large crowd of faculty members
gathered at Monday's meeting
of the Senate Assembly, the larg-
est faculty governing body at the
University.
In his presentation, Hanlon
stressed that the University has
made and will continue to make
an effort to provide enough
financial aid to make tuition
affordable for its students.
Hanlon said 70 percent of
Michigan residents and 50 per-
cent of out-of-state students
receive some form of financial
assistance. Despite the continu-
ing increase in operating costs,
$188 million in grants, $138 mil-
lion of centrally awarded finan-
cial aid and $50 million dollars in
federal loans were distributed to
students this past year, according
to Hanlon.
While the University's finan-
cial aid meets the gap between

expected family contributions
and the cost of attendance for
Michigan residents, the same
cannot be said for out-of-state
students, Hanlon said.
"We would love to meet the
needs of non-residents, but we
just don't have the resources,"
Hanlon said.
Hanlon 'said the University
understood the importance of
reducing the burden on in-state
students in need of aid and aims
to keep the school socio-econom-
ically diverse.
"We are not where we want
to be, but we are working on
it," Hanlon said. "Low-income
students are much less likely to
apply than higher-income stu-
dents, even among (those low-
er-income) students who have
strong academic preparation."
Hanlon noted that many low-
er-income igh-school students
don't believe they can afford a
degree despite the fact that the
University meets all financial aid
needs of in-state students.
"We are not getting the mes-
sage across," Hanlon said.
To remedy this frequent mis-
conception, Hanlon - said the
University has hired a mar-
keting coordinator to educate
high-school students on college
affordability.

MUSICAL REFLECTIONS

For bicentennial,
site sheds light on
personal stories
By DANIELLE
RAYKHINSHTEYN
Daily StaffReporter
In 1870, Madelon Stockwell
became the first woman to enroll
at the University. She was fol-
lowed by 33 women the next fall

and together they laid the path to
2013, where about 50 percent of
University students are women.
Stockwell's story and oth-
ers can now be found at a new
website, University of Michigan
Heritage, which celebrates the
history and tradition of the Uni-
versity community.
The website was created to cel-
ebrate the University's upcoming
bicentennial in 2017. Kim Clarke,
the University's director of exec-
utive communications and the

project manager for the website,
said she views the website as the
research team's gift to the Uni-
versity for its 200th birthday.
Clarke; James Tobin, an asso-
ciate professor at the University
of Miami in Ohio and graduate
of the University; and LSA senior
Kaitlyn DelBene researched and
wrote stories featured on the site.
Clarke said the project began as
a way to display the University's
legacy, "so our role atthis point is

Four-year-old LSA
unit to hire three
new faculty
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
DailyStaffReporter
After starting the Interna-
tional Studies Program at New
York University, William Clark
was recruited by the University
to run its flourishing Program
in International and Compara-
tive Studies.
Clark, the director of PICS,
said the program recently

dropped the name "Center in
International and Comparative
Studies" to bring the title in line
with the purpose of PICS - to
deliver a rigorous curriculum in
international studies to a large
number of undergraduates.
The four-year-old program,
with five different tracks of
study, has been experiencing
exponential growth and now
has 700 concentrators and 70
students pursuing minors. Clark
said the program was developed
in response to student interest.
"I think students are interest-
ed in things that are internation-
al," he said. "It is a reasonable

response to an increasing inter-
dependent world."
PICS draws upon professors
from the University to deliver
a flexible and varied curricu-
lum to its students, Clark said.
They're in the process of hiring
three professors who will hold
dual appointments in PICS and
other parts of the University.
"I want to give students the
freedom to pursue their inter-
ests (but also give them) a rig-
orous curriculum that will
prepare them for after they
graduate," Clark said.
Clark said there were trade-

Helping the blind get around
could involve less help from
canines and more help from

computers in the future.
That's just one of the many
technological advances that
investigators at the University's
Center for Future Architectures
Research could make possible.
The $28-million University-led
research center, which opened
Jan. 17, involves researchers
from 15 different universities.
"One medical application we
are developing is a device that
can perceive images for a blind
person," said Associate Engi-

neering Prof. Valeria Bertacco, a

Bertacco described a glasses-

"Each identified item is then
coded in a sound sequence and

To fight genocide, go without

50Oyears ago this week
(December 8,1962):
After returning from a trip
to East Asia, then-University
President Harlan Hatcher
urged the use of English as
the language of international
communication, the Daily
reported.
At a public reception in Hill
Auditorium, Hatcher said the
first objective of American
universities should be keeping
English as an international
language. He reported the
decreasing use of English in
the nations he visited and
cited the University's English
Language Institute in Thai-
land anoan important project
combating this trend.

25 years ago this week
(December 4,1987):
Then-Vice President George
H. W. Bush visited Oakland and
urged Michigan Senate Repub-
licans to ratify the intermediate
nuclear arms treaty that was to
be signed by President Eeagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gor-
bachev, the Daily reported.
At an "Ask George Bush
Town Meeting," Bush
addressed about 300 people
on the elimination of weapons,
urging attendees to demon-
strate their support.
"We're about to get a deal
where the Soviets take out all
1,600 (weapons) and we take out
our 400, and for the first time in
history eliminate a whole class

of weapons," he said.
5 years ago this week
(December 6,2007):
A campaign organized bycthe
national anti-genocide student
organization STAND encour-
aged students to give up one
luxury item from their daily
lives to help protect displaced I
Sudanese civilians in Darfur,
according to the Daily.
Instead of buying her daily
lotte, LSA senior Alice Mishkin
chose to give $3 to victimsoof the
genocide in Darfur.
"If you only spend $3, then
you could protect a woman in
Darfur for a day - that's pretty
ridiculous," said LSA freshman
Joe Pieroni.

Snyder asks for
court ruling on
right-to-work law
Gov. Rick Snyder on Monday
asked the Michigan Supreme
Court to rule quickly on the
constitutionality of a right-to-
work law that takes effect in two
months, saying questions over its
impact onstate employees must be
resolved before new contract talks
begin this summer.
By requesting an , advisory
opinion, the Republican governor
sought to avoid a "proliferation"
of state and federal legal challeng-
es expected to be filed in lower
courts by labor unions.
"The uncertainty over the law's
,impact upon state civil servants
that protracted litigation would
create would be very divisive and
would not serve the interests of
judicial economy," Snyder wrote
in a letter to Chief Justice Robert
Young Jr. Snyder is hoping for a
rulingbefore the court's term con-
cludes at the end July.

Penney also plans to add price

shopping at the chain - a strat-
egy used by a few other retailers.
For store-branded items such as

Japan's new
import rules help
U.S. beef industry
Ranchers welcomed Japan's
decision Monday to ease restric-
tions on U.S. beef imports, say-
ing it will provide a boost to the
American meat industry but
cautioning that it will take time
before exports to Japan reach
their levels of a decade ago.
Japan is one of the biggest
importers of U.S. beef, despite
restrictions that for years haven't
allowed the import of beef from
cattle older than 20 months
instead of the industry standard
of 30 months. Those restricted
imports were only allowed after
Japan banned U.S. beef altogeth-
er in 2003 after the U.S. recorded
its first case of mad cow disease,
which can cause a fatal brain dis-
ease in humans.
The news of the expanded
export market is especially wel-
come now because the beef

industry has been hurt by sev-
eral years of high feed prices and
the drought that hit cattle coun-
try hard the past two years, said
J.D. Alexander, president of the
National Cattlemen's Beef Asso-
ciation.
THE HAUGE, NETHERLANDS
Dutch Queen
stepping down,
son will be king
The Netherlands' Queen Bea-
trix announced Monday that
she is ending her reign after 33
years and passing the crown to
her eldest son, who has long been
groomed to be king but who will
have to work hard to match his
mother's popularity.
The widely expected abdication
comes at a time of debate over the
future of the largely ceremonial
Dutch monarchy, but also as calm
has descended upon the Nether-
lands after a decade of turmoil
that saw Beatrix act as the glue
that held together an increasingly
divided society.

very complex topic ... and it is
one that is very importantto the
University," Hanlon said.
Faculty members asked
about affirmative action based
on socioeconomic status and
about admissions policies that
compensated for the ban on
race-based affirmative action.
Hanlon said the University
attempted to recognize the dif-
ficulty of growing up in a finan-
cially disadvantaged household
by giving weight to how well
students overcome adversity.
Many faculty members in
attendance expressed both
enthusiasm that college afford-
ability was being addressed
and disappointment that they
had known so little about the
University's financial aid ini-
tiatives."
Senate Assembly Chair Kim-
berlee Kearfott, professor of

nuclear engineering and radio-
logical sciences, said financial
aid and affordability had been
a staple of many Senate Assem-
bly meetings.
"Many, many Senate Assem-
bly (meetings) have gone off to
this topic," Kearfott said. "This
is something we care about."
Kearfott said she was happy
Hanlon had made his presenta-
tion and felt that the University
is headed in the right direction.
"It is my understanding that
the University is fully commit-
ted to making Michigan afford-
able for all in-state students
and their policies reflect that,"
Kearfott said.
Senate Assembly member
Ellen Muehlberger, an assistant
professor of Near Eastern Stud-
ies, said student perception of
an expected kind of lifestyle
made the University culturally
inaccessible for students of a
lower socioeconomic status.
"I identify with students
who say Michigan has a rich

culture, and it is hard to be a
student who is not rich here,"
Muehiberger said.
Muehlberger said, for her, the
question that remained on the
table was how to make the Uni-
versity accessible for students
who "have the talent to be here"
but may not show it in a tradi-
tional manner.
"The things we use to mea-
sure merit just reproduce socio-
economic status," Muehlberger
said. "We should do a lot more
to make the University accessi-
ble not only financially but also
culturally."
Kearfott said the issue of
affordability and financial aid
would be further discussed in
a Senate Assembly meeting in
March. That meeting will fea-
ture a presentation by Vice Pro-
vost Martha Pollack.
"I am very much looking for-
ward to the additional discus-
sions and presentations so we
can have a complete picture,"
Kearfott said.

TECH
From Page 1
on the sounds that he or she
'hears.'"
C-FAR aims to create the
"technology of 2030" by improv-
ing devices' use of semiconductor
components, called transistors.
Bertacco, who leads reliable sys-
tems research at C-FAR, called
these tiny components the "build-
ing block" of any electronic
device.
However, C-FAR researcher
Krste Asanovi, a professor of
computer science at the Universi-
ty of California, Berkeley, said the
tiny computer chips are reaching
their limits in size and ability.
"We're hitting the physical
limits," Asanovi said. "They're
not getting much faster or much
smaller."
Transistors switch electronic
signals within electronic devices,
providing the processing power
for a machine. They are used in
every modern electronic device
- often with billions in an indi-
vidual machine.
Engineering Prof. Scott Mahl-
ke, who's part of Asanovi's team,
said transistors used to be able to
shrink by half each year, allowing
more of these components to fitcon
a single chip. The rapid increase
in the density of transistors dra-
matically increased the overall
computing power of electronics
over the past half-century.
"We lost the ability to double
speed," Mahlke said. "They just
can't get any smaller. Once the
computer industry loses the dou-
bling, what do we do? We can't
rely on circuits. We need better
architecture that uses the exist-
ing transistors better that provide
the gains people are used to."
Because transistors may not
be able to shrink further with-
in the next five years, devices

Tuesday, January 29, 2013 - 3
will require better, specialized
architectures to improve overall
performance and functionality,
Asanovi said.
"One of the big trade-offs in
processing is 'more specialized,
less general purposes,' "Asanovi®
said. "How are we going to
make specialized devices widely
usable? You want to specialize
more but you want to retain (gen-
eral functionality)."
Mahlke said cell phones that
are aware of their environment
could be a product of special-
ized technology currently under
development. , For instance,
one's cell phone might be able to
instantly translate a sign written
in a foreign language.
"You can look things up on
the web, but it's not really aware
of your presence," Mahlke said.
"Cell phones are going to be a lot
more aware of your surround-
ings. It could whisper in your
ear, 'That's Mr. Jones over there
and you don't like him.' Today's
phones couldn't keep up."
Moinuddin Qureshi, associate
professor of computer systems
and software at the Georgia Insti-
tute of Technology, is a researcher
for the C-FAR storage team. He
studies ways to make tomorrow's
phone "keep up" in terms of mem-
ory capacity; noting that future
memory systems could be 100
times faster than current systems.
Qureshi and his fellow
researchers are focused on pack-
ing more bytes, or units of mem-
ory, into the same physical space
to allow more advanced and com-
plex systems.
These futuristic operating
systems could then be used to
instantly restore data and pro-
grams in use before power was
lost. The research also focuses
on improving power efficiency -
perhaps one day enabling heavy
users to go a day without toting
around a power cable or extra
battery.


PIZZA
From Page 1
pizza, better quality (and)
being established here for 16
years" are all factors that will
help NYPD maintain their cus-
tomer base.
"I don't know if (Toppers)
will have any impact on my
business because we make very
different products," Telemaco
said. "We both make pizza ... I
think we make different kinds
of pizza."
Telemaco said he has a loyal
customer base that will keep
NYPD busy for the foreseeable
future.

"We've been here for long
enough that people know us in
town," Telemaco added. "One
quality about us is that the
product has never changed -
it's been consistent."
LSA senior Robert Bowen
said he goes once a week to
NYPD, where he enjoys eating
and studying.
"I think the food is good, and
it's reliable, and I think they're
friendly here," Bowen said.
He said eating at NYPD is an
"experience" beyond just hav-
ing a meal.
"(The employees) go the
extra mile. They're really
friendly - it's more of a per-
sonal environment than a lot

of the other stores," Bowen
said.
Bowen said though he will
remain loyal to NYPD, he
thinks the other pizza restau-
rants on the street will succeed
because of the high demand for
pizza in the area.
LSA junior Nadeem Persico-
Shammas said he also goes to
NYPD once a week and, though
he enjoys eating there, he's
open to trying the new restau-
rants in the area.
Persico-Shammas said he
would change his routine
of going to NYPD - which,
according to him, is the "best
pizza in town" - to try Top-
pers.

to share some of those interest-

"We know that the Univer-
sity's bicentennial is in 2017 ...
so we said we better start think-
ing about this and the different
ways to showcase the Univer-
sity's history, so our role at this
point is to share some of those
interesting stories of the past,"
Clarke said.
Serious consideration went
into curating the right stories
on the site's timeline theme. She
said the research team wanted
to pick names that would sound
at least slightly familiar to stu-
dents, such as the first women
at the University and William
Revelli of Revelli Hall.
"When you read what the
first women were dealing with,
you might have a better sense
of what it's like for, perhaps, a
first-generation student from a
low-income family, or someone
from another country," Clarke
said. "I think you'd see some
similar threads even though the
episodes are 120 years apart."
The website currently con-
tains 10 stories with accompa-
nying photos. Clarke said the
goal is to add one story each
month starting next year and
lasting until the bicentennial.
They already have a tentative
outline of stories for the coming

year.
The plans for the web-
site after the bicentennial are
unknown at this point, though
Clarke said she would like to see
it a permanent part of the Uni-
versity's archives.
Research for the website was
all done at the Bentley Histori-
cal Library on North Campus,
which is the official archive for
the University.
Karen Jania, head of the ref-
erence division at the library,
said the site shows the Uni-
versity is not only focused on
academia but on its rich past as
well.
"The way you go through the
story and the way you see all
the images (is) fantastic," Jania
said. "It's for anyone who wants
to learn anything about the Uni-
versity." '
DelBene, the LSA senior
working on the project, said the
site was time consuming but
worthwhile because of the sto-
ries she discovered.
"It can be really challenging
because you don't know what
you're going to find, but ulti-
mately you find a story worth
telling (and) it's super reward-
ing," DelBene said.
She added that seeing the
culmination of two and a half
years' work was a great moment
for her. k
"The most obvious draw is
for alumni just because they like
to still have the connection to

the University now that they're
gone, and I think the most obvi-
ous interest is there," DelBene
said. "But I think for students
it's just really important, learn-
ing the history. It's allowed me
to really appreciate what's here
today and how it came to be."
Like Clarke, University
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said
the website is the first step in
preparing for 2017. He added
that the University wants peo-
ple to be informed of its history
inorder to reallyunderstandthe
significance of the milestone.
"What you're seeing on the
website are some of the stories
that tell some of the rich histo-
ry of the people, the issues and
the topics that Michigan people
have struggled with or gotten
their heads around and really
worked through for almost 200
years being captured in very
unique ways," Fitzgerald said.
"I just think there's some
really fascinating stories of peo-
ple who've went on to do great
things and also people who did
great things almost in anonym-
ity."
Fitzgerald said the site is evi-
dence that there is always his-
tory being made here in Ann
Arbor.
"We keep on writing new
chapters of the Michigan his-
tory each day and each year, so
I'm confident there will be great
stories to share for many years
to come," Fitzgerald said.

State management of Detroit park may boost economy
Belle Isle, a Detroit-owned island park on the Detroit River and
site of the Chevrolet Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix, is currently
being considered for temporary lease to the State of Michigan.
According to the agreement made on Jan. 17, Detroit retains owner-
ship of the park but will temporarily transfer park management to the
state, putting it in charge of the park's operations and repairs for the
next 10 years. Once a major attraction to the city, funding difficulties
left the island's landscape and buildings deteriorated, and according
to park manager Keith Flournoy, by 2010, no budget was dedicated to
the park. The park and the Detroit community may financially benefit
from the temporary switch in management, and the city should sup-

me, it can get a
little tiring. Our
University has

of the world's
greatest think- ANDREW
ers, leaders and ECKHOUS
dreamers, but
doesn't calling
ourselves "the leaders and best"
1,000 times at every football game
devalue the title just a little bit?
This Wednesday, however, the
University is kicking off a two-year
celebration for a man who exem-
plifies everything our University
should stand for. Raoul Wallenberg,
a 1935 graduate with a degree in
architecture, is, quite simply, one
of the most benevolent humanitar-
ians of all time. If you aren't aware
of who he is, you owe it to yourself
to get educated.
Wallenberg was born in Swe-
den in 1912 to a wealthy family. His
grandfather was a Swedish diplo-
mat, and shortly after Wallenberg
graduated from the University, his
grandfather helped him get a job
working at an import and export
company in Stockholm owned
by a Hungarian Jewish man. As
World War II escalated, Hungary
implemented laws that essentially
barred Jews from any rights. This
forced Wallenberg to become the
main business intermediary for his
company in Hungary, giving him
a direct view of the Nazi's indis-
criminate hatred and violence. It
was this knowledge that catalyzed
Wallenberg to become a hero, sav-
ing tens of thousands of Jews from
deportation to the Nazi death
camps.
With the assistance of several
international and philanthropic

organizations, Wallenberg was
appointed as a Swedish diplomat
to Hungary with the clandestine
objective of rescuing as many
Jews as possible. Wallenberg was
given enough money to rent out 32
buildings, which he immediately
declared Swedish extraterritorial
space. With the help of about 350
people, he began issuing protec-
tive passports to Jews. These pass-
ports, though not technically legal,
seemed legitimate and convinced
the Nazi officials thatthe Jewswere
Swedes awaiting repatriation. The
rescued people were given rooms in
one of the 32 buildings, where they
rode out the remainder of the Nazi
occupation. By the time of his dis-
appearance in early 1945, which has
never been solved, Wallenberg and
his team had saved almost 100,000
Jews from certain death.
Wallenberg was not a typi-
cal human being. Though he was
born with a silver spoon, he chose
to work during his time in Ann
Arbor. A classmate of his remem-
bered Wallenberg decided not to
join a fraternity because "it would
isolate him from a certain strata
of students." When he traveled
around North America, he liked to
hitchhike. He told his grandfather,
"you're in close contact with new
people every day. Hitchhiking gives
you training in diplomacy and tact."
With such care for his fellow man
and an exemplary sense of humil-
ity, it's no wonder that Wallenberg
is celebrated worldwide.
Since 1990, the University has w
given out the Wallenberg Medal
annually to people who have "acted
selflessly without expectation of
reward" to honor the memory of
Wallenberg. And what person bet-
ter personifies "moral excellence .
in ordinary people?" Every time
that he issued a protective pass-
port, he was disobeying Nazi law.
Every time that he housed a Jewish
man, woman or child, he was mak-

ing himself a target. All for 100,000
people that he didn't know. All for
100,000 people who weren't even
similar to him. Wallenberg didn't
share a religion, a nationality or
even a native tongue with any of the
people he saved, yet he was willing
to die for them.
Simply put, Raoul
Wallenberg was a
mensch.
And he never stopped being
courageous, even being so bold as
to hand out protective passports
in plain view of armed Hungarian
troops. When he caught wind of a
Nazi plan to plant explosives in the
Budapest ghetto, he thwarted it by
threatening to indict the men on
war crimes charges. Simply put, he
was a mensch.
We're lucky that none of us will
ever be put in a situation that dire,
but there's still much we can learn
from Wallenberg. He could've
stayed in Sweden and lived com-
fortably but he felt compelled to
fight for what was right. He under-
stood that all people are created
equal and deserve the same rights.
Even if it's something as small as
withholding judgment on a person
you've just met, your small actions
honor Wallenberg's legacy of faith
in the human spirit.
He may not be sponsored by
Ugg like Tom Brady, or lend his
voice to Star Wars like James
Earl Jones, but if we're seri-
ous about this "leaders and best"
business, Wallenberg should
become the face of this university.

S

port the plan.
Though the state will continue to collect
the revenue during the lease, these funds will
be entirely devoted to Belle Isle and will be
transferred to the city at the end of the lease.
The state has also pledged to invest millions
into beautifying and upgrading the park to
once again make it an attraction. The agree-
ment would save Detroit $6 million in mainte-
nance fees. While some Detroit residents have
questioned the state's intentions with Belle
Isle, arguments claiming the state will exploit
Detroit through its.ownership of the park are
unconvincing. Just as other state parks have
brought thousands into other cities across
Michigan, the increased attention given to
Belle Isle can provide the same boost in tour-
ism and recreation - a boost Detroit desper-
atelyneeds.
Currently, Detroit carries the unfair bur-
den of being the primary funder of the larg-
est island park in the nation. Detroiters have
been the only group taxed to maintain Belle

Isle, which is accessible to everyone in the
state. Managed by the Department of Natural
Resources, the lease and operation of the park
would not only distribute this burden, but also,
as Gary Brown, the Detroit City Council presi-
dent pro tem, points out, "attract revenue from
around the state." It will be an opportunity to
foster collaboration and good will between the
state and Detroit, which remain counterpro-
ductively strained.
Given that Belle Isle has deteriorated
while Detroit's economy struggled, the pos-
sibility of leasing Belle Isle is a cost-effective
decision. The lease agreement should be seri-
ously considered because it not only main-
tains Belle Isle's longstanding ownership by
Detroit, but also distributes the unfair bur-
den of financing the park and fosters mean-
ingful collaboration between the state and
the city. It's a way to reinvigorate a park that
the people of Michigan - especially the citi-
zens of Detroit - deserve.

Local, but not perfect

Since 2008, the Center for Entrepreneur-
ship has served as a home base for impact-
driven students on campus. By providing
academic programs at undergraduate and
graduate levels, hosting events like annual
trips to the Bay Area and fostering a vibrant
community, CFE has jumpstarted a spirit of
entrepreneurship on campus.
Initially based on North Campus, the Cen-
ter for Entrepreneurship has now opened
a new office on Central Campus on the first
floor of the Shapiro Undergraduate Library.
As a CFE peer adviser and start-up co-
founder, this is a particularly exciting develop-
ment, one that signals that a growing number
of students are looking to put their ideas into
practice. It also demonstrates that libraries
on campus are becoming more collaborative.
They're evolving from a place designed for
individual learning to a place where people
gather to generate new ideas. In my opinion,
this paradigm shift away from the traditional
concept of a silent library is positive. Who
knows, maybe you'll even meet the next co-
founder of your company at your table.
While we all know the story of Mark Zuck-
erberg building Facebook in his dormitory
room, entrepreneurs benefit from working
in a dynamic environment where passionate,
creative and diverse individuals can interact

and engage. A presence on both North and
Central Campus means that no matter what
or where students are studying, they're now
just a few minutes away from a community of
students and faculty who can provide invalu-
able start-up resources and advice.
Until recently, entrepreneurial activity was
concentrated primarily in the engineering and
business schools. In the last few years, incred-
ible projects have emerged everywhere from
LSA to the School of Information to the School
of Natural Resources. I hope that a new cam-
pus-wide approach to entrepreneurship will
encourage students to think about innovative
solutions to problemsin new disciplines aswell.
The new space on Central Campus offers
open space for student entrepreneurs and
start-up teams to meet as well as academic
and venture advising for students.
So, if you have an idea that you can't stop
thinking about or just want to learn about
the academic programs offered through CFE,
I encourage you to stop by. Whether you're
studying engineering, political science or
anything in between, you can find a home
base just a few minutes away. To celebrate the
new CFE space at Shapiro, we're hosting an
open house on Wednesday, Jan.30 at1:30 p.m.

used tobe one of those foodies
who waxed poetically about
heirloom tomatoes, kale and
foraged mush-
rooms. I have
the documen-
tary "Food, Inc."
to blame for my .
blind devotion
to these foodie
staples. Robert
Kenner's look at ZOE
America'sindus- STAHL
trialized food
system left me
feeling "enlight-
ened," holier-than-thou and unable
to eat most of the conventionally
farmed food in my fridge.
After watching Kenner's film, I
became outraged by the inhumane
treatment of animals on what's
known as "the killing floors," areas
expressly designated. for the slaugh-
teringof animals; monocultures, you
know, those rows and rows farm-
ers grow of the same exact crop like
soybeans or corn that deplete soils
of their nutrients; and the fact that
being poor in America often meant
eating cheap and processed foods.
I then became, no joke, a militant
supporter of the local alternatives
demonstrated by farmers like Joel
Salatin, owner of Polyface Farms -
though practices were called into
question after learning that his
cult-like organization only employs
interns with an "all-American look"
- brunettes like me need not apply.
So, empowered bythe film's message
of "voting with my fork," I became
one of those local-food zealots.
However, a couple of summers
ago, my religious faith in the local-
food movement began to waver. I
worked at Rosenhill, an organic
farm an hour outside of Stockholm,
Sweden. The farm was picturesque
- a quilt of flowers and vegetables
bordered by apple orchards. But
the synonymy of local farming and
ecological harmony quickly began
to diverge. I realized that organic
farming didn't guarantee healthy

soil or efficient farming practices (I
can count on two hands the times I
ate food fresh from the farm).
My food studies class that fall
only confirmed my doubts and
knocked me farther off my high
horse. Reading James McWilliams's
"Just Food," I realized that local
food is not necessarily environmen-
tally sustainable. "Food miles" are
not always an accurate measure of
environmental impact, considering
thatproduction, processingand food
preparation account for the majority
of food's energy use. I also learned
of organic agriculture's shortcom-
ings - lower yields and detrimental
effects of certain natural chemicals.
I came to understand that geneti-
cally modified foods can sometimes
reduce the. negative environmental
impact often associated with tradi-
tional agricultural activities.
In its place, McWilliams provided
a revised definition of sustainable
eating, one that focuses on seasonal-
ity and vegetarianism. McWilliams
argues that, regardless of how far
the food must travel, seasonal pro-
duce usually requires less energy in
production and processing (think
tomato grown in the hot fields of
California vs. Michigan tomatoes
grown in a greenhouse). McWil-
liams also didn't let us forget that
whether conventional, grass-fed or
free-range, animal production is
always detrimental to the earth's
land, water and air supply.
With this vision of sustainabil-
ity, I look at the University's Ann
Arbor Sustainable Food Purchasing
Guidelines with equal parts pride
and concern. I'm glad that the Uni-
versity recognized food purchasing
as a crucial component in achieving
long-term sustainability, and I'm
even happier that the'University said
by 2025, 20 percent of the food they
purchase will be sustainable.
But just crafting food sourcing
guidelines isn't enough. According
to the University's guidelines, food
can be considered sustainable if it's
local, which the University defines as

"within the state of Michigan or 250
miles of campus; third-party certi-
fied," (You know, certified organic,
fair-trade certified, rainforest-alli-
ance certified, etc.), "and artificial
hormone-free and antibiotic-free."
Just because you
grow it in your
backyard doesn't
mean it's better.
The list goes on to include free-
range poultry and eggs, grass-fed or
pasture-raised meats and sustain-
able fisheries. This interpretation
gets us only halfway there. Free-
range poultry and antibiotic-free.
meat lead to slightly more humane
animal treatment and greater
human health. Fair-trade certifica-
tion will help to guarantee better
labor conditions and higher pay for
the often-maltreated farntworkers.
However, I fear that if the Univer-
sity relies on the current guidelines
to meet this goal, the sustainability
ball might not make it up the hill.
Instead of crafting a comprehensive
definition of sustainability, the Uni-
versity has focused on not what's
truly sustainable, but what's en
vogue. While eating organically and
locally is the philosophy du jour, the
University ought to create a more
nuanced definition.
And out of our academically rig-
orous and research-centric Univer-
sity, I expect nothing less. I know
that it's a difficult task and that the
definition of "food sustainability" is
ever-changing, but I hope nextyear
the University flouts what's ideo-
logically fashionable to create more
holistic food purchasing guide-
lines, that perhaps includes more
seasonal and vegetarian options.

Local Natives takes flight

Alt music
grows-popular

'Hummingbird'
soars with dark,
introspective sound
By JACKSON HOWARD
Daily Arts Writer
At the end of 2009, Local
Natives found itself at the top of
the indie rock world after releas-
ing its excep-
tional debut,
Gorilla Manor.
Thebandtoured Hummingbird
the festival cir-
cuit, -received a dotal Natives
good amount of Frenchkiss
media coverage
and performed
on a few talk shows. And then it
disappeared. The buzz from the
first album had all but faded by
the time the band announced
its second album, Hummingbird,
almost three years after its debut.
Hummingbird isn't a carbon
copy of Gorilla Manor, but rather
a darker and more introspective
version. The National's Aaron
Dessner is behind the boards, and
his influence is felt in every minor
chord throughout the album.
Not that the lyrics on Gorilla
Manor were worthless, but on
Hummingbird, lead singer Tay-
lor Rice sings them likes he real-
ly means them. Singing on an
exponentially more melancholy
album than its predecessor, Rice
sounds less like the light-hearted
20-something that sang on the
band's debut and more like a man
who has just emerged from a
Brooklyn basement after spend-
ing the last three years drinking
whiskey and crying about a break-
up.

One of these is not like the other.
In fact, the band's light-hearted
sound has been tinted so dark, it
makes you wonder if some trau-
matic event occurred in the three
years the group was recording
the album. The rattling drums
of Gorilla Manor are still present
on Hummingbird, but this time
they're accompanied by sparse
piano chords, haunting guitars
and very little orchestral arrange-
ment.
The opener, "You & I," sets
the mood, as Rice sounds utterly
defeated, asking in a desperate
falsetto, "When did your love
grow cold?" The song, save a great
horn-backed bridge, is subdued
and glum, but still manages to
move along at a reasonable pace.
Most of the songs on the album
follow in this despondent vein -
"Three Months" incorporates a
piano sound reminiscent of The
National and a falsetto from Rice
that is so smooth it evokes The
Weeknd, while "Colombia" uti-
lizes a simple drum machine and

slowly building chords that create
a sad and palpable tension.
The emotional weight of the
album is definitely heavy, and
there's a point where Rice's
pained vocals and the band's
ominous and dejected sound get
a bit exhausting. Gorilla Manor-
was great because it kept the lis-
tener engaged, even in its lowest
and most pensive moments. On
Hummingbird, there are times
when Dessner's production feels
messy and disjointed. His work is
probably more suited for a band
like The National and not Local
Natives, which requires a less
minimalist and more engaged
sound. At worst, a few songs, like
"Black Spot" and the aforemen-
tioned "Three Months," have no
real audible structure, and instead
simply linger.
On the contrary, tracks like
"Wooly Mammoth" and "Break-
ers" - two of the best - show
that the album isn't all gloom. On
"Wooly Mammoth," grungy bass,

electric organs and cymbal crash-
es envelop the band's twisting
vocals, while "Breakers" shakes
the album awake after four slower
songs. The latter is an epic com-
bination of hyperactive guitars,
Beach Boys harmony and a float-
ing, wordless chorus that is sure
to be used in some upcoming car
commercial.
The work comes to a rest on
"Bowery." With drums pitter-
pattering and synths vibrating in
the background, an electric-gui-
tar solo rings out, the harmonies
swirl louder and louder and the
track continues to build - it feels
like it's about to overflow - and
then nothing. The song ends,
leaving behind a feeling that can
be only described as severe emp-
tiness. "Every night out I ask
myself / Am I giving enough?"
Rice wonders on "Colombia."
Listen to Hummingbird a few
times, and it's clear that (in his
opinion) the answer will always
be no.

at at work on the music
charts in the past year or
so - yes, strange forces indeed.

unsung alternative hits, the
catchy-yet-overlooked successes
that rarely crack the highest
50 on the Billboard 200, and
almost never the Top 10.
This past year was perhaps a
bit of an anomaly. Not one, but
two singles managed to fend
off the rather terrifying attacks
of Nicki Minaj and her merry
band of cohorts to cling to that
coveted "We're Number One!"
pedestal - even if only for a few
weeks.
What's even more amaz-
ing is that they weren't the
heavyweight contenders we
might expect. Nobody bats an
eyelash when Coldplay squeaks
in (except for Nicki Minaj,
because she's battingthose
things everywhere these days).
But somehow, a Belgium-born
Australian with a name nobody
truly knows how to pronounce
(go-tee-yay? Gah-te6-yay? Got-
yee?) mops up the American
music scene after laying waste
to more countries than Godzilla
- who, in retrospect, seemed to
be-pretty exclusive to the whole
Japan thing. "We Are Young,"
by fun. wasn't necessarily out
of left field, (nor the subsequent
success "Some Nights"), but
considering the band's highest
previous accolade was No. 3
on Billboard's "US Tastemaker
albums" chart, there didn't
seem to be a ton of buzz. I'm not
going to look up what a taste-
maker is, but I'm pretty sure
they're the heroic people who
make my Ben & Jerry's Half-
Baked ice cream.
The point is, these two rather
humongous hits were harvested
from obscure fields. You might
say "it's inconceivable that
somebody anticipated these
songs!" To which I would say
"this is my column! Get out!"
And after practcing my bum's
rush technique, I would like to
make it clear: Yes, they were
anticipated.
Let me introduce the culprit:
Sirius XM Radio, specifically
the channel "Alt Nation." These
alt-enthusiasts managed to
scoop and lean heavily on "We
Are Ydung" and "Somebody
That I Used to Know" way

before either was pumping out
of beer-encrusted speakers at
the nearest frat house. Both
songs hit the station's 8 most
requested songs (dubbed the
Alt-l8). Both hit the Billboard
charts not long after.
"Why would this matter?"
you might fire back at me. Let
me counter: "Seriously, get out
of my column. I'm not asking
again."
Ultimately, it matters if you
believe that this year wasn't
so much of an anomaly as a
precipice - a sign of things to
come. When Foster the People's
"Pumped Up Kicks" shot up
the charts, I brusled it off as
an inconsequential blip on the
music radar. But I've come
around - and I don't want to
make the same mistake twice.
I've pored over the songs,
the hits and misses and creepy
songs about Bloody Mary and I
think I've come up with a short-
list of potential future hits that
are making the rounds on Alt
Nation. I'm not Nostradamus.
I'm not Paul the Octopus. I'm
just a guy making a few edu-
cated guesses.

'Heartthrob'
By GREGORY HICKS
Daily Arts Writer
The folk-pop duo has official-
ly gone full-blown synth-pop,
and such a polished 21st-century
music tran-
sition rarely A
occurs.
Tegan and Heartthrob
Sarahave never
been a force Teganand Sara
to "treat like Sire
(they're) oh so
typical." That
said, what doesn't make Heart-
throb typical? What makes this
record different than any other
indie pop artist trying to make
some extra spending money by
jumping-on the synth-pop band-
wagon?
Tegan and Sara know who
they are as artists - not exactly
a vocal powerhouse, but most
certainly a songwriting pow-
erhouse. The duet continues to
churn out lyrics that exceed the
work of any hit-maker, even for
its melodically radio friendly
tracks like the album's lead sin-
gle, "Closer." Catchiness is no
excuse to sacrifice quality word

choice.
It's not a complete solo effort
on their part, however. Recruit-
ing Grammy award-winning
producer Greg Kurstin to assist
with the album's production was
a well-played decision, given
his musical resum6. Artists like
Kelly Clarkson and P!nk owe
Kurstin for his work in breeding
an artist's original style with a
21st-century sound, and Heart-
throb never falls short of that.
Tegan and Sara claim that
this seventh studio album is
their most personal album to
date - strange, considering the
reputation synth-pop has for
being a tawdry tone. But per-
haps synth-pop is a contempt-
ible style for generally having
flavorless underlying composi-
tion. A heap of intimacy sustains
balance with the record's genre
approach, similarly seen from
British sensations Ellie Gould-
ing and Florence + the Machine.
Thanks to Morgan Paige and
his Canadian Top 40 hit "Body
Work," Tegan and Sara had
the opportunity to experiment
with EDM prior to their . sev-
enth album, followed by their
inclusion of "Every Chance We
Get We Run" on David Guetta's
Nothing But The Beat 2.0.

"One Way Trigger" unfor-
tunately takes its cue from the
latter camp, sporting an angu-
lar synth that's more "Machu
Picchu" than "12:51" and a
similarly pioneering attitude
with ultimately underwhelm-
ing results. There are moments
where it works - Fab Moretti's

gets it together in time to belt
a catchy, falsetto-filled chorus
- but more where it doesn't.
There's the crowded, haphazard

entire opening minute. But per-

"One Way Trigger" is its distinct
lack of the scruff that distin-
guished The Strokes in the first

"Two Kinds of Happiness" still

it's disappointing. It's too early
to say The Strokes have taken

Goal
up for
grabs
Four months into
season, Berenson
still undecided on
starting goalie
By GREG GARNO
Daily Sports Writer
Flashback to 1994, when goal-
tender Marty Turco arrived at
Michigan as a promising pros-
pect, recently drafted by the Dal-
las Stars in the fifth round of the
NHL Entry Draft.
Turco, arguably one of Michi-
gan's greatest netminders,
started nearly every game for
Michigan coach Red Berenson
in his four years in Ann Arbor,
regardless of whether he had a
rough showing the night before.
The only exception was injury or
sickness, of course, in which case
the future NHL All-Star sat out.
The same is true of his succes-
sor, Al Montoya, for the next four
years. And once Shawn Hunwick
took over as starter in 2011 after
The Big Chill, he started just
about every night, too.
Berenson has always been a
one-goalie coach. However, this
year he hasn't had an opportuni-
ty to start one goaltender consis-
tently. And he still doesn't have a
plan to stick with one goaltender
after being swept by No. 9 West-
ern Michigan.
"It's still to be determined,"
Berenson said. "That starting job
is wide open."
After junior goaltender Adam
Janecyk allowed eight goals in
two games - Friday's 3-2 loss and
Saturday's 5-1 defeat - the Wol-
verines are once again searching
for someone to step up when the
offense doesn't.
Janecyk has started five con-
secutive games, yet he has failed
to benefit from the consistent
playing time.
It's difficult to pinpoint where
goaltending has fallen short
this year. It's possible that the
defense, which has never been
healthy all at once, has not done

Stand-up Carmody

looks completely E
different than it ENEMY
did in October, and LINES
it's all because of
one player..
The player is the Wildcats'
best, senior forward Drew
Crawford, who was expected
to be their big contributor this
year. But in December, Crawford
was forced to get season-ending
surgery on a torn labrum in his
right shoulder, throwing North-
western's early season plans in
a completely different direction.
The Wildcats have had an
inconsistent season, but with a
matchup against No. 3 Indiana
on Saturday looming for the
Wolverines, the potential for a
trap game and another North-
western upset exists.
At Big Ten Media Day in Chi-
cago, Northwestern coach Bill
Carmody sat down with the
Daily to discuss the upcoming
season.
The Michigan Daily: Is there
something about this year in
particular that makes the con-
ference so strong?
Bill Carmody: It just seems

deferred to Jon at times. Then
we have four freshman, two
transfers, and two guys who
redshirted last year - we~have
to play a little differently, but I
think we have some guys who
can score in different ways. We
have to figure that out as a staff,
how we are going to go about
that, but I like the fact we have
gotten bigger.

won that game ... ?"
BC: I think we had to win a
couple more to make the NCAA
Tournament, to tell you the
truth. I think we would have had
to win at least two in the Big Ten
Tournament. We had the 19th-
best strength of schedule in the
country, but you can't be 8-10 in
the conference. We needed to
be 10-8. Only then does the 19th
rank help you.
TMD: I have to ask, how
annoying is it to have to keep
answering questions about
Northwestern never making the
NCAA Tournament? Does it get
old?
BC: Yeah, it gets old.'But the
program is right at that point -
we are at a much better point
than we have ever been. The

But even in the years of Turco,
Montoya and even Hunwick,
the defense still had its lapses,

... these are stoppable plays - our
goalie, our defensemen, our for-

"There are just too many
unearned goals against, and that
means the goalie and the defen-
semen both."
In Kalamazoo, the Wolverines
were caught chasing Bronco for-

wards on breakaways multiple
times, leaving Janecyk to make
the save, but no one to clear the
puck.
"I think we did a good job for

seman Lee Moffie of the week-

ties, but when we did they were
just grade-A.
"It's something we have to

Dwyer has now been cleared

starting position. "You just have

and see what happens."
But Berenson and the Michi-
gan coaching staff had their No. 1
goalie - their prodigious replace-
ment to Hunwick - all lined up
before last season. John Gibson,

a member of the Kitchener Rang-
ers of the Ontario Hockey League
and U.S. junior gold-medal team,
had committed to filling the figu-
rative bigshoes left by Hunwick.
But Gibson opted to play in the
OHL and left Berenson without
a solid option for this season. So
when asked about whether he
thinks about what the Anaheim
Ducks prospect could have done
for the program, the veteran
coach was left smiling and nod-
ding.
"Oh yeah," Berenson said. "No
question."
Nonetheless, the Wolverines
must move forward with what
they have. And there are certain-
ly areas that must be improved
soon to secure a decent position
in the CCHA playoffs.
There have been signs that
Michigan can take the pressure
off of its goalie. In the first period
of both games over the week-
end, the Wolverines forecheck
performed well, keeping the
pressure away from the crease.
Going forward, Michigan looks
to continue to attack, limiting the
action in its defensive zone.
Berenson and Moffie also talk-
ed about making better passes
to limit turnovers. The-issue of
untimely turnovers has been a
trend for much longer than the
recent series, though, and contin-
ues to be an emphasis in practice
and on film.
Fast forward to Friday when
the Wolverines host in-state rival
Michigan State. There's still no
front-runner in net.

Northwestern, led by coach Bill Carmody, faces Michigan on Wednesday.

After a historic start, a small relapse

Once-hot hands
cool off, and 'M'
finds itself in a
small slump
By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
As the Michigan men's basket-
ball climbed to the No. 1 ranking
in the country in the Associated
Press poll, the women's team
dropped out of the Top 25 after a
two-week appearance.
* After gaining the No. 25 rank-
ing on Jan. 14, the Wolverines
(5-2 Big Ten, 16-4 overall) moved
up to No. 23 on Jan. 21 as they
pushed their winning streak to
a program-best 10 games. But
following two losses in the past
week to No. 7 Penn State and No.
24 Iowa, they are now the first
team out, at No. 26.
While Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico and her players
have said in the past the ranking
doesn't mean much to them, two
home losses in a week do.
Playing in front of a season-
largest home crowd of 2,842
against the Lady Lions last week,
the Wolverines struggled from
the field, shooting a season-low
27.8 percent. Michigan never
put up much of a fight, as senior
forward Rachel Sheffer was the
lone player in double figures
that night with 20 points and 10
rebounds.
The Wolverines' leading scor-
er, senior forward Kate Thomp-
son, has had limited production.
Though she is still averaging
15.1 points and 4.6 rebounds per
game, Thompson's numbers have
dropped since her seven 3-point-

and Kate," Barnes Arico said.
"(It) really made us unsure of
what we were doing offensively."
While the game against the
Hawkeyes can be seen as just
an off day for Sheffer, since she
tallied a combined 39 points in
the two games prior, the recent
inconsistency of Thompson
might just be the beginning of
things to come.
"Well, I think teams are really
keying on (Kate), and they're
really setting their defense to
take her out of what she's capa-
ble of doing," Barnes Arico said.
"I think she needs to make some
adjustments. She needs to be able
to curl off screens, and she needs
to be able to do some different
things, and we have to find some
better ways to set screens."

like there are a lot of good guys
back. You have some very good
veteran players back on some
of these teams, and then you
have this influx of very talent-
ed freshman. There are some
freshmen who are All-Big Ten
caliber already. There aren't any
bad teams. We used to be one of
those teams five, six, years ago,
but we aren't now. Some other
teams who were in the same
position have gotten better and
better. Ijust think top to bottom,
the conference is tough.
TMD: You return four start-
ers, but you are losing a big fifth
starter in Jon Shurna. What's it
been like this off-season prepar-
ing for the season without him
and not having that type of play-
er return?
BC: I think guys had to start
accepting different roles. You
might get more out of Drew
Crawford, who might have

level of players that we have got-
ten here has improved, we've
got some good players here, and
good players make good coaches.
TMD: Was there something
you had to do about the culture
when you got to Northwest-
ern? Is that something you can
change right away?
BC: Anytime you have an ath-
letic program, it's a university
program.Youhavetogetsupport
from the top down, all the way
from the president to the ath-
letic director, and I think we got
that support and are getting that
support. I think that's necessary,
all the support staff that help
you with the market, put some
money into that just to raise the
consciousness of everyone in the
area. Then the Big Ten Network
comes along and people can see
you play teams like Ohio State. It
levels out to be a university-wide
decision to support us.

Sophomore guard Trey Burke and the Michigan basketball team are the No. 1 team for the first time since the Fab Fire.
Fab again

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
Nov. 30,1992.
Trey Burke was only 18 days
old, and Glenn Robinson III's
father was just a sophomore at
Purdue the last time the Michigan
men's basketball team was ranked
No. t in the Associated Press poll.
These were the days of the Fab
Five, when the Wolverines were
expected to win multiple national
championships with the talents of
Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Chris
Webber, Ray Jackson and Jimmy
King. Whitney Houston was on
the top of the charts with her hit
"IWill Always Love You."
And now, more than 20 years
later, Michigan is back on top. The
Jan. 28 edition of the AP's Top 25
was released Monday with the
Wolverines earning a whopping
51 of the 65 total first-place votes.
Kansas finished at No. 2 with just
13 votes, and No. 4 Florida got the
final first-place vote.
Michigan had the chance to
assume the No. 1 ranking two
weeks ago when it visited Ohio
State, but it opened the game flat
and couldn't come back in the
loss. And in a similar situation
two weeks later, the Wolverines
headed to Champaign to face Illi-
nois on Sunday with the chance to
actually take over the top spot.
So the Wolverines redeemed
themselves in a 74-60 win over the
Fighting Illini and made a case to

earn what has probably inthe back
of their heads for the past couple
weeks.
Michigan coach John Beilein
and the rest of the team have been
mum about the rankings after the
Wolverines hinted that the No. 1
spot may have been a distraction
in the game against the Buckeyes,
but after Sunday's game, sopho-
more guard Trey Burke finally
admitted he thinks Michigan is
the best team in the country.
"I think (we deserve the No.
1 ranking)," Burke said. "I don't
think that was our goal, obviously
we want to be No. 1, but I think as
of right now we (deserve to be)."
So do the voters. Well, one
group of them, at least. With
Sunday's win, Michigan is off to
its best start in program history
at 19-1, but there's a bit of a com-
plication. The ESPN/USA Today
Coaches poll also has some weight
in the discussion of which team is
the nation's best.
Kansas, which is riding a
18-game winning streak, was
ranked ahead of Michigan at No.
2 in last week's ESPN/USA Today
Coaches Poll and squeaked into
the No. 1 spot in that poll on Mon-
day. The Jayhawks finished just
three points ahead of the Wolver-
ines for the top spot and started an
argument as to which team actu-
ally should have the No.l ranking.
On Monday, Michigan gained
an unlikely ally. Michigan State
coach Tom Izzo thinks the best

team in the country is obvious.
"I'll probably gain some ene-
mies and probably gain some
friends," Izzo said in a teleconfer-
ence. "Michigan deserves to be
No. 1. If you look at their body of
work, if you look atthe consistency
they have played with and look at
those two guards, Hardaway and
Burke, they can control a game.
They've been solid.
"If I had a vote, I'd have to vote
them No. 1, even though it's your
rival. Who wants to do that? But I
also have respect for what they've
accomplished."
But even after the rankings
were released, like before, Beilein
is still focused on the Wolverines'
goal of raising another Big Ten
championship banner. Beilein
mentioned Sunday that nobody
really remembers who was No.1in
January of past seasons, and he is
trying to keep his players focused
on each game ahead of them,
ignoring the hype surrounding the
ranking.
Redshirt sophomore forward
Jon Horford agreed with his
coach, saying that at this point in
the season, wins are more impor-
tant than the team's ranking.
"(Being No. 1) means a lot for
the program and for the fans, I
know that," Horford said. "I can't
speak for the team, but I feel (they)
vaguely feel the same way I do.
Being No. 1 in the nation means
nothing - it's all about who's
number one in the end."
