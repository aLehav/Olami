*NCAA:MICHIGAN BROKE RULES

- Much work left for
'U' before NCAA
probe's conclusion

In a series of interviews
yesterday, NCAA
experts discussed what's
* next in probe process
By NICOLE ABER
Daily News Editor
While yesterday's announcement that
the Michigan football program allegedly
violated NCAA regulations was billed
as the culmination of the NCAA's four-
month long evaluation of Michigan's
Athletic Department's compliance with
NCAA rules, it was by no means the end
of the process.
The NCAA's notice of allegations,
which was made public in a University
press conference yesterday, was the next
step in a chain of proceedings that will
now span at least one year - from when
the allegations were first published
in the Detroit Free Press in August of
2009 until at least when the University
goes before the NCAA's Committee on
Infractions this upcoming August.
The University now has 90 days to
formally dispute or agree with the alle-
gations. In a series of interviews fol-
lowing the announcement, experts on
the process, politics and implications of

NCAA investigations said that while the
outcome of the case is difficult to predict,
most institutions typically end up agree-
ing with the NCAA's findings - often
resulting in penalties for the schools.
Some of the experts said the Universi-
ty may not face as serious repercussions
as programs facing allegations pertain-
ing to specific student-athletes.
But others said that, in cases like this,
the fact that the NCAA found enough
evidence to send the notice could be a
bad harbinger for the University, which
could ultimately be penalized with pro-
bation for a couple of years or a decrease
in the number of coaches who can par-
ticipate in practices.
No matter the final outcome, the
experts interviewed yesterday said that
University officials have a lot of heavy
digging left to do and sleepless nights
ahead of them before the process is final-
ly concluded.
Josephine Potuto, chair of the NCAA
Committee on Infractions from 2006 to
2008, said in an interview that NCAA
allegations most often result in penal-
ties.
"The enforcement staff at the NCAA
does a pretty good job of investigat-
ing, and they should, and they're pret-
ty responsible about only bringing
allegations where they think there's

Officials have 90 days to
formally respond, will
face hearing in August
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily NewsEditor
The Michigan football program has
committed five violations of NCAA rules
and regulations, according to a notice of
allegations the University received from

the NCAA yesterday. The findings are the
outcome of a four-month investigation by
the NCAA into the University's Athletic
Department.
The University will fonally respond to
the allegations, which
were announced by first reported on
school officials at MihngvnDayom
a news conference
yesterday afternoon, in the next 90 days.
The University will also appear before
the NCAA's Committee on Infractions in
August.

The notice of allegations asserts that
the University violated NCAA regula-
tions in five main areas. First, the notice
says that the University's football program
broke NCAA rules that limit the number
of coaches that may work with student-
athletes. The notice states that five quality
control officers - staff members who are
not technically coaches, but work with the
football team - illegally engaged in coach-
ing activities.
The NCAA also alleged that the Uni-

The NCAA's Notice of
Allegations released
yesterday states that
the University violated
NCAA regulations in
five main areas.

ALLEGED VIOLATION 1
The University's football program
exceeded the number of hours coaches
may work with student-athletes and
that five quality control officers illegally
engaged in activities reserved exclusively
for team coaches.

ALLEGED VIOLATION 2
The University's football program vio-
lated regulations that prohibit staff from
monitoring student-athletes in voluntary,
off-season workouts and conditioning -
activities for which they are accused of
having exceeded time restrictions on.

ALLEGED VIOLATION 3
Alex Herron, a graduate assistant foot-
ball coach, provided misleading, and at
times false information about his role in
the allegations of misconduct during the
NCAA's investigation into the Michigan
football program.

ALLEGED VIOLATION 4
Rich Rodriguez acted in a manner that
"failed to promote an atmosphere ofcom-
pliance with the football program" and
failed to properly monitor the activities
of his program with regard to the allega-
tions set forth by the NCAA.

ALLEGED VIOLATION 5
The athletic department did not properly
oversee the activities of the football
*program to ensuretfull compliance with
NCAA rules and regulations as they
relate to the allegations set forth by the
NCAA.

Panel talks Native American remains
Museum director
discusses relationship
between museums,

Graham institute to offer

Native American tribes
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
Native American remains held in the
University's Museum of Anthropology,
which have long been a topic of contention
within the University community, were
the focus of a workshop yesterday as part
of the University's current theme semester
entitled "Meaningful Objects: Museums
in the Academy."
A group of about 30 anthropologists,
archeologists and concerned members
of the University community gathered to
hear Sven Haakanson, Jr., executive direc-
tor of the Alutiiq Museum in Alaska, speak
and answer questions about relationships
between museums and Native American
tribes. Haakanson also discussed how the
issue of repatriation is often handled at
other museums.
The discussion was organized by the
Ethnography as Activism Workgroup
- a group comprised of mostly Univer-
sity graduate students that is part of the
Rackham Interdisciplinary Workgroup
program and is dedicated to using ethnog-
raphy to promote activism.
Ethnography as Activism held the
event in an effort to continue the dia-
logue regarding the controversy over the
remains.

Program will allow
students from different
departments to study
sustainability
By CAITLIN HUSTON
Daily StaffReporter
This upcoming fall semester tlfe Uni-
versity will offer a new program aimed at
encouraging education in sustainability.
The Graham Environmental Sustain-
ability Institute, a partnership of nine
schools and colleges at the University,
announced the launch of the Under-
graduate Sustainability Scholars Pro-
gram last week. Starting next semester,
the interdisciplinary program will offer
a 10-credit series of sustainability cours-
es to students during their junior and
senior years.
Steven Wright, education director at
the Graham Institute, said the goal of the
program is to bring together students
across many disciplines that have an
interest in sustainability.
"A lot of the problems that 'relate to
sustainability, like climate change and
energy, are so complex that we really
need people from different programs
working together to solve them," he said.
Though the program is new, officials
at the institute have been thinking about
initiating the program since the institute

first opened in 2006. Wright said the
institute offers individual courses about
sustainability, but wanted to create a
more coherent program.
Lisa Pappas, marketing communica-
tions director at the institute, said the
scholars program consists of four com-
ponents - an introductory seminar, a
course about the campus and sustain-
ability, an elective course and a place-
based course, which allows students in
the Graham Institute to travel.
Pappas said students in the institute,
though not in the scholars program,
have the opportunity to travel to Kenya
and Camp Davis in Wyoming to study
alternative forms of energy. Students
accepted into the scholars program will
have all their expenses covered for these
courses, Pappas said.
The program will also award its grad-
uating participants a certificate from the
Graham Institute, and the school the
student is graduating from will decide
whether the students will receive a note
on their transcript saying they complet-
ed the program.
Pappas said this distinction should
help attract students who are passionate
about sustainability because it will pro-
vide them with a tangible record of their
achievement.
"They can receive a unique endorse-
ment to acknowledge this scholastic
achievement, which will be very helpful
in them moving forward in their careers

Anthropologist Sven Haakarson Jr. (left) discusses repatriation of Native American artifacts yesterday.

The University has about 1,400 remains
in its possession, 'which the University
claims are culturally unidentifiable. Under
the Native American Graves Protec-
tion and Repatriation Act, the University
claims it is obligated to keep the remains
until final regulations concerning repa-
triation are released or the United States
Secretary of the Interior instructs the Uni-
versity to release them.

However, several Native American
tribes claim the remains belong to them
and should therefore be returned.
Haakanson said it shouldn't mat-
ter whether it is possible to identify the
remains. He said the Native Americans on
Kodiak Island, Alaska - where his muse-
umis located - accept repatriated remains
even if their ancestry is unknown.

Alarming pranks

On Monday nighn students in
Wean Quadrangle Residence Hall
were forced to evacuate after
hearing the familiar sound of the
fire alarm.
Though a sprinkler head being
set off was the cause of Monday
night's alarm, Weat Quad resi-
dents have been forced to evacu-
ate three times since Feb. I due to
false fire alarms.
Despite the recent spike in false
fire alarms in West Quad, Declan
Login, the associate director of
Housing Security, said the cur-
rent rate of false fire alarms is
considerably lower than in used
to he, adding that it's unusual for
students to pull the fire alarm as a
practical joke.
"It almost never happens any-
more," Lugin said. "Twenty years
ago, it happened all the time. It
was ridiculous."
Lugin said fraternity memhers

were common perpetrators of the
pranks.
"We extrapolated that some of
the (false alarms) were attribut-
able to the fraternities based upon
their location, very close to the
exit by the frat and due to infor-
mation we were hearing from
our student officers at the time,"
Lugin said.
Lugin explained that the false
alarms may have been pranks that
new fraternity members were
required to participate in before
initiation.
"Fraternities would say, 'As
part of your pledging or whatever,
you have to pull a false alarm',"
Lugin said. "The fraternities close
to South Quad did that all the
time."
Lugin said the frequency and
inconsistent timing of the prank
alarms kept University Housing
officials guessing about when the

next false alarm would be.
"You couldn't necessarily catch
them, it might happen tonight, it
might happen next week, you just
don't know," he said.
Lugin added that since the inci-
dents, the University has taken
measures to discourage pranks
that involve pulling fire alarms.
Officials have installed plastic
covers on top of alarms, which
sets off an alarm in the area if it
is taken off. Once the alarm lever
is pulled, the alarm will sound
throughout an entire building.
Login said the sound system
successfully deters pranksters
from messing with alarms.
"We never used to have (the
covers)," Lugin said. "Now, when
you take that off to pull the alarm,
in sounds 95 decibels. tf I'm being
malicious, typically that will scare
me off."

U' has 90 days to respond to allegations

The economic stimulus law
added between 1 million to 2.1 mil-
lion workers to employment rolls
by the end of last year, a new report
released yesterday by congressional
economists said.
The nonpartisan Congressio-
nal Budget office study also said
the $862 billion, stimulus added
between 1.5 to 3.5 percentage
points to the growth of the econ-
omy in 2009. The controversial
stimulus law combined tax breaks
for individuals and businesses with
lots of government spending.
The report reflects agreement
among economists that the mea-
sure boosted the economy. But the
wide range of estimates means it
won't resolve the debate over how
effective the stimulus has been.
The White House says the stim-
ulus bill has created 2 million jobs
and will add another 1.5 million
thisyear as economic recoverycon-

Daily wire reports

From Page1A
versity violated regulations that
prohibit staff members from
monitoring football players in
voluntary, off-season workouts
and conditioning - two activities
that the athletic department is
also accused of having exceeded
time restrictions on.
Both of those potential viola-
tions first surfaced in a Detroit
Free Press article that was pub-
lished in late August. In the wake
of that report, the NCAA and the
University both launched inde-
pendent investigations into the
matter.
The notice of allegations - the
culmination of the NCAA's inves-
tigation - also specifically called
out Michigan football coach Rich
Rodriguez for acting in a manner
that "failed to promote an atmo-
sphere of compliance within the
football program" and for failing
to sufficiently monitor the activi-
ties of his program with regard to
the other allegations.
The athletic department is
similarly charged with not prop-
erly overseeing the activities of
the football program with regard
to the allegations.
Alex Herron, a graduate assis-
tant football coach, is accused of
providing NCAA investigators
with misleading and, at times,
false information about his role
in the situation.
University President Mary
Sue Coleman, Rodriguez and
incoming Athletic Director David
Brandon announced the notice of
allegations at the press confer-
ence yesterday afternoon.
Coleman began the briefing by
saying that the University "has
been cooperating with the NCAA
in its investigation of our football
program."
"Intercollegiate athletics is a
fundamental feature of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, and we take
pride in the integrity of our ath-
letics program," Coleman said.
"We also take full responsibility
for knowing and following NCAA
rules and thus view the allega-
tions seriously."
Coleman added that she and
other University officials are
"addressing concerns, quickly
and head on."
-."All of us - Coach Rodriguez,
David Brandon and I - are deeply

committed to compliance with
NCAA rules and the future of our
football program," she said.
Brandon announced the notice
of allegations from the NCAA
during the press conference.
Brandon said the NCAA brought
allegations of wrongdoing in the
number of hours student-athletes
spent practicing and violated
rules governing what activities
could be attended by quality con-
trol staff.
"We clearly made mistakes
in those areas, and we have
already taken action to prevent
any of those mistakes from being
repeated," Brandon said.
Brandon then went on to pro-
vide what he described as a
"top-level perspective" of the
allegations.
"In some out-of-season prac-
tices where there are alleged
overages, the overage is approxi-
mately two hours in a week,"
Brandon said. "During the season
on some Sundays, the allegation
is that the University of Michi-
gan exceeded the daily permis-
sible practice time by less than
an hour. In a single instance,
the allegation is that an overage
caused the team to exceed its
20-hour weekly permissible limit
by 20 minutes."
He continued: "I have looked
into these permissible prac-
tice hours issues, and I want to
emphasize there were no situa-
tions where any student-athlete's
welfare was put at risk."
However, Brandon reaffirmed
that he would stand behind
Rodriguez and that he would
return next year as the team's
head coach.
"Rich Rodriguez is our football
coach," Brandon said during the
press conference.
Brandon added that he believes
the reason behind some of the
allegations is the result of "inter-
nal confusion."
"We had a lack of clarity
around whether time spent in
stretching and warm-up activi-
ties were 'countable minutes,'
and this represents a portion of
the discrepancies between the
NCAA's findings and our prac-
tice routines," he said. "Two of
the NCAA allegations relate to
how the institution and the coach
monitored those two areas of
concern."

Brandon stressed that the
NCAA's notice of allegations
found no loss of institutional con-
trol.
"This is very important, there
was no charge of loss of institu-
tional control - none whatsoev-
er," Brandon said.
However, Brandon did raise
some concerns over a reference
made within the NCAA's letter
to Coleman that points to NCAA
bylaw 19.5.2.1, which describes
the so-called repeat violator rule.
"We are aware that we may be
subject to this rule because of the
1996 basketball case, which as
we all know, was a very different
situation," Brandon said. "While
penalties are up to the NCAA to
decide, we understand the rules
do allow for discretion."
"In the basketball case, the
University of Michigan complet-
ed its investigation of the pro-
gram and self-imposed penalties
in November of 2002," Brandon
continued. "The NCAA did not
impose sanctions in that investi-
gation until May 2003,so the pro-
bationary period assessed by the
NCAA continued through May
2008, which overlaps with the
currently alleged violations by
five months."
Brandon also emphasized that
corrective measures were already
underway, but that more would
come in the near future.
"We have established a new
'fail-safe' procedure to help us do
our internal tracking in a timely,
effective way," Brandon said.
"Now if the CARA forms are late
by two weeks a notice goes to the
head coach and AD. If the forms
are still late one week later, it
goes to the president."
"Another example: Our quality
control staff is no longer present
in any activity that could be con-
strued as a coaching situation,"
Brandon continued. "And, we
are updating and redoubling our
efforts on staff education in all
areas."
However, Brandon admitted
there was still more work that
needed to be done.
"We will spend time carefully
reviewing all of the allegations
and determining how they.match
with our own internal investiga-
tion that was conducted in tan-
dem with the NCAA," Brandon
said. "If there are any instances

where details of some allega-
tions do not match, we will pro-
vide that information as part of
our responsive materials to the
NCAA."
Brandon said University offi-
cials may also choose to self-
impose sanctions as they continue
to review the allegations and pre-
pare their response to the NCAA.
"During this review period,
we also will consider, and imple-
ment, any sanctions we choose to
self-impose," Brandon said.
Despite today's announce-
ments, Brandon said he looks
forward to working with oth-
ers in the athletic department to
address the allegations raised by
the NCAA.
"As the incoming athletic
director, I want to make clear
that no accusation against our
program is trivial. We take this
report very seriously, and we
will learn from it and get better,"
Brandon said. "I look forward to
working with Coach Rodriguez
and his staff to address these con-
cerns and continue the forward
momentum of our football pro-
gram."
Current Athletic Director Bill
Martin was not present at the
press briefing, but expressed his
support for Brandon's leadership
-in a statement released after the
press conference had ended.
"We have cooperated fully
with the NCAA, and we have
been rigorous in our investigation
of these matters as well," Martin
wrote. "Now it is important that
we carefully review the allega-
tions, and move appropriately
through the remainder of the
process, to determine findings
and ensure full compliance going
forward."
Martin continued: "I know
Dave Brandon will guide the
athletic department through the
remainder of this process with
excellent judgment, and I have
every confidence that Coach
Rodriguez, the entire football
program and the compliance
office can work together to make
any necessary improvements."
In a statement released on
behalf of the University's Board
of Regents, Regent Andrew Rich-
ner (R-Grosse Pointe Park), who
serves as the chairman of the
board, said steps would be taken
to ensure the program's compli-

ance in the future.
"The Board of Regents receives
the NCAA notice of allegations
with disappointment," Richner
wrote. "The University of Michi-
gan is an institution that believes
in maintaining the highest stan-
dards of integrity and sports-
manship within it's athletic
program."
"We will undertake a consid-
ered and thorough review-of the
allegations with the president
and incoming athletic director,"
Richner continued. "We will
expect them to take all necessary
steps to ensure full compliance
with both the letter and spirit of
all NCAA rules."
Lloyd Carr, associate athletic
director and former Michigan
football coach, also released a
statement following yesterday's
press conference. In it, Carr said
he was convinced the program
would be able to overcome the
challenges it currently faces.
"I am confident we will resolve
the issues that confront us in
this NCAA report. From what I
understand, there isn't anything
we can't improve quickly and eas-
.ily," Carr wrote. "I think we'll be
able to correct any concerns, put
this behind us and move the pro-
gram forward."
The NCAA launched its probe
into the allegations in October
when NCAA Vice President of
Enforcement David Price sent
a letter of inquiry to Coleman.
At the time, Price said he antici-
pated the investigation would be
completed by the end of last year
- though he said the date was a
goal and not a deadline.
The investigation was focused
on allegations that Michigan's
football team had violated
NCAA restrictions on the num-
ber of hours student-athletes are
allowed to spend in practice and
off-season workouts. However,
from the beginning, NCAA offi-
'cials said they would look into any
"new information" that may sur-
face during the investigation.
In addition to the NCAA's
investigation into the allegations,
the University launched an inter-
nal investigation into the matter
days after the Free Press pub-
lished their article. No update or
comment on the internal investi-
gation has been given since it was
launched..

"Whether they're Caucasian
or not, we're still going to treat
them the same way when they
come back with the remains,"
Haakanson said. "We're going
to treat them the same way we
would treat any of our own ances-
tors. So, that's the way we're
always going to treat human
remains."
Additionally, Haakanson
said though the two groups
may seem at odds, both the
museums holding the remains
and the Native American
tribes that want them back are
trying to do the right thing.
"Indigenous groups want
to treat the human remains
with the most respect by
returning them into the
ground," Haakanson said in
an interview after the event.
"While, on the other side,
the anthropologists (and) the
researchers want to document
and learn from the human
remains. So you have a major
conflict of world views com-
ing together."
Haakanson said in order for
museums and Native Ameri-
can tribes to coexist, they
need to compromise and find
agreements that are respect-
ful to all the parties involved.
He cited an example from
his own museum. After speak-
ing with an elder from one of
the local tribes, the museum
staff learned that a bearskin
they had on display at the
museum was of great cultur-
al significance to that tribe,
Haakanson said. The museum
had been allowing visitors to
touch and play with the skin,
but upon learning of its signif-
icance, immediately stopped
that practice.

Though the deadline of March

Pappas said there have been sev-

"We can clearly see that students
want this sort of thing," she said.
Pappas also said the institute

elder told the museum staff that
the tribe believed that all bear

that the bears' spirits could find
their way home. The museum

tration that the University and

be at an impasse regarding what

Engineering senior Zoha

ditional classes because students
will be allowed to express their
opinions in a classroom setting.
"I think that with students

Green for the Great Lakes
Obama should deliver on his $5 billion promise
ith health care hogging the headlines since President
Barack Obama took office, other reform proposals
have received relatively little attention. But efforts to
protect the Great Lakes deserve more notice - and funding. The
Obama administration's five-year blueprint for the Great Lakes,
which is made up of $2.2 billion to protect, preserve and restore
the Great Lakes' ecosystems, is only half the $5 billion that was
initially promised. The Great Lakes play an important role in the
already suffering state economies in the region. To provide ade-
quate protection for this vital resource, the federal government
must fulfill the rest of its pledge and provide the full $5 billion to
protect the Great Lakes.

Snyder is no Superman

You know what politics clearly
needs? More gimmicks. Seri-
ous discussion of issues is so
pass6. But have no
fear - Republican
Rick Snyder, a can-
didate for Michi-
gan governor, is
here to rescue you
from the drudgery ,
of politics. He's
about as gimmicky
as possible.
Snyder's first RACHEL
campaign adver- VANGILDER
tisement ran dur-
ing the year's
Super Bowl - a
ballsy move to start with. It billed
Snyder as "One Tough Nerd." A voice
that sounded like the guy who does
movie trailers railed against ineffec-
tive career politicians. And in swept
Snyder with a call to "reinvent Michi-
gan." The ad also billed Snyder's
10-point plan as "so detailed that,
well, it's likely no politician could
even understand it."
The ad's (kind of overbearing) con-
descension aside, it's prettygimmicky.
He has a catch phrase and a slogan, for
Pete's sake. Snyder isn't a politician in
these ads; He's a product.
It gets worse. Snyder recently held
a contest online to choose his next
campaign ad, appropriately named
"Pick Rick's Ad." One ad compared
Snyder to some of the most recog-
nizable "nerds" in the world: Micro-
soft founder Bill Gates and Apple
CEO Steve Jobs. The other ad had
the gumption to compare him to the
"nerd" Clark Kent/Superman.
If the ads themselves weren't
enough of a publicity stunt, the com-
petition to choose the next one took
Synder's gimmick to a whole new
level. It's like "American Idol." Vote
now for your favorite candidate!
You, America, will decide who will
become the next (pause for dramatic

effect like Ryan Seacrest does) Michi-
gan governor!
This campaign's format was a risky
move for Snyder. It's nontraditional
- not to mention egocentric. It could
be off-putting for a lot of voters, espe-
cially since Snyder is running as a
Republican. You know how us Repub-
licans love tradition. It doesn't pres-
ent Snyder as a serious politician and
it doesn't make his stances on a lot of
issues clear. Instead, he's presented as
a brand. Stepping away from real poli-
tics and into the market is dangerous
territory for a serious candidate.
For me, it's the Superman option in
Snyder's "Pick Rick's Ad" campaign
that really grinds my gears. As a die-
hard Superman fan - hey, I can get
my geek on - I'ns kind of insulted.
Snyder is undoubtedly smart. But like
the song says, he's no Superman.
On the other hand, this risky move
might actually pay off. Snyder's a
businessman - and a fairly success-
ful one at that - and he's selling
himself like a. product. And Ameri-
cans love their consumerism. People
will remember him when they go to
the polls. People are going to think
of Snyder as "that guy from the nerd
commercials." And that name rec-
ognition could be a valuable tool for
someone who has relatively little
fame in Michigan. And after the
debacle that Democratic Gov. Jenni-
fer Granholm is sure to leave in her
wake, people might actually go for
the "One Tough Nerd" thing.
That actually kind of scares me.
I would expect Michiganders to
choose leaders based upon the issues,
not who has the catchiest campaign.
I hope that voters have the sense to
choose action over advertising.
But my (perhaps poisoned with
obsession) feelings about Super-
man and annoyance with gimmicky
advertising aside, the real deal is that
Snyder actually has some good quali-
ties that make him electable, accord-

ing to the biography on his campaign
website. He is a University grad -
which wins him major points in my
book - and he's actually a remark-
ably intelligent man, if the MBA and
Law degree he obtained by age 23 are
any indications.
And Snyder is a successful busi-
nessman. He was a big wig at Gateway
for years. And I buy into the concept
that Michigan needs, a businessman
at the helm (horrible pun absolutely
intended). The state's economy is,
all delicacy aside, in the crapper.
And maybe it will take the business
savvy of someone like Snyder to turn
Gov. candidates
should be more
than a gimmick.
around the sloppy budget and failing
business climate.
I'm not ready to throw my hat
entirely in Snyder's ring yet. Michi-
gan Attorney General Mike Cox
is also a strong contender for the
Republican nomination. And so far,
he hasn't attempted to liken him-
self to any comic book characters -
which, for me, is working in his favor.
But I'd still have to say that Snyder
is a little more corporate mogul Lex
Luthor than mild-mannered Clark
Kent. Though I doubt he has sinister
plans to use Kryptonite to precipitate
Superman's downfall and take over
the world in a blaze of tyranny, I still
think his advertising gimmick lacks
substance. And I want my leaders to
have substance.

On Sunday, Environmental Protec-
tion Agency administrator Lisa Jackson
released a five-year blueprint for the Great
Lakes. During Obama's presidential cam-
paign, he pledged $5 billion over 10 years
to help the Great Lakes. The project was
scaled back to a $2.2 billion, five-year com-
mitment. It includes a "zero-tolerance
policy" toward invasive species, cleanup
programs for the heavily polluted areas
and wetlands renewal efforts. Also includ-
ed in the plan are mechanisms to watch the
health of the ecosystem and to ensure that
governmental departments involved in the
efforts are held responsible. By 2014, the
administration hopes to finish cleaning up
five toxic "hot spots," decrease how many
invasive species are detected in the lakes
by 40 percent, significantly reduce the
amount of phosphorous runoff and protect
about 100,000 acres of wetland.
These efforts are long overdue. Runoff
from cities and farms has caused a vari-
ety of environmental prollems, including
unnatural algae blooms and even beach
closings. Wetlands ecosystems have been
so seriously neglected over the years that
their stability is in danger. Contamination
of the ecosystems of the Great Lakes can
wreak havoc on the local and state econo-
mies that depend on them, as well as on the
30 million people who rely on the lakes for

clean drinking water.
One of the most important aspects of the
plan to protect the Great Lakes is its focus
on preventing future invasions of foreign
species into the lakes. For decades, the
lakes have been overrun by zebra mussels,
which not only harm the shipping indus-
try by latching onto passing boats but can
also block pipelines and disrupt municipal
water services and hydroelectric compa-
nies.
More recently, the possibility of invasion
by Asian carp has alarmed some regional
state governments so much that they have
asked the U.S. Supreme Court to issue an
injunction to force Illinois to close the
waterways that feed into the Great Lakes.
And this worry is justified - Asian carp
have the potential to devastate regional
ecosystems. With this threat at large, the
government needs to provide all of the aid
promised to ensure that this resource is
not significantly damaged.
The five-year blueprint for the Great
Lakes is a vital step towards the res-
toration of a central element of both
Michigan's economy and its identity. But
half-filled promises aren't enough. The
Obama administration must fulfill the rest
of its pledge and commit to a long-term,
full-scale effort to restore and rebuild this
regional asset.

J 's back to basics.
Over the past year, perhaps
becausewe live inuncertaintimes
or because we are
upset with the sta-
tus quo, Americans
have been engag-
ing in an exercise of
reconnecting with
the basic principles
that matter. Con-
sider the two fol-
lowing examples
and you'll see what 'T MA.AO
I mean.
First, the Repub- PAVONE
lican National _
Committee tried
to implement a
"purity test" - a set of ten principles
inspired by Ronald Reagan that would
force Republican candidates to adhere
to at least eight principles if they
wished to receive RNC support. And
perhaps more importantly, Ina Gar-
ten, the jolly "Barefoot Contessa" of
the Food Network, recently published
a cookbook titled "Back to Basics."
Never have I seen a more delicious
feast for both the eyes and the brain.
So whether you're in the mood for
conservative philosophy or for braised
beef short ribs with port wine reduc-
tion and sweet corn panna cotta, this
is your time to explore the basic phi-
losophies that give your life purpose
(or at least make you a better cook).
I have decided to jump on the band-
wagon. Perhaps it's simply because
I have too much time on my hands.
Then again, maybe I was just inspired
by Garten's succulent devotion to the
basic tenets of cooking. I leave such
ponderings to you.
Regardless of the reason, the follow-
ing is a set of basic principles forwhat I
call "the pragmatic liberal," anidentity
with which I strongly identify.
1. Empathy.
We are not endowed with omni-

science and therefore we cannot
expect to fully know why people
choose to do what they do or why
they live the way they live. We also
cannot expect to relate to all the out-
side factors that impact people's lives.
For this reason, the pragmatic liberal
approaches social issues with a strong
sense of empathy. This, in turn, means
that the pragmatic liberal refrains
from judging others and focuses on
understanding them instead.
2. Humility.
One of the basic tenets of pragma-
tism is to know yourself and your own
boundaries. Such introspection leads
to a sense of humility- even Bill Gates
needs advice every once in a while. In
short, the pragmatic liberal recogniz-
es his or her own imperfection, seeks
support from others and adopts per-
spectives grounded in humility.
3. Solidarity.
My mother loves to say thathumans
are a social species and it's true. We
need one another to survive, to evolve
and to live a fulfilling life. Recognizing
this, the pragmatic liberal seeks to bal-
ance his or her own self-interest with
a legitimate concern for society. This
doesn't mean that the pragmatic lib-
eral is selfless - rather, the pragmat-
ic liberal remembers that his or her
actions can both help and harm oth-
ers, and that ultimately his or her own
well-being is contingent on everyone
else's well-being.
4. The belief that the status quo
always needs improving.
Perfection doesn't exist and there-
fore there is no reason to be fully sat-
isfied with the status quo..Someone
always needs help, an unexpected
problem will always arise, ineffi-
ciencies and inequalities will always
demand our attention. This is the
driving reason why the pragmatic lib-
eral believes in progressivism - our
goal should always be, in the words of
our Constitution, "to form a more per-

feet Union."
5. The understanding that self-criti-
cism leads to strength.
Never has the United States been
weaker than in the aftermath of Sep-
tember11th when allforms of criticism
were purged. The world is imperfect
and we are an imperfect nation com-
posed of imperfect individuals. The
pragmatic liberal recognizes that in
order to better oneself, one must be
willing to criticize oneself. The inabil-
ity to engage in self-criticism is not
demonstrative of confidence, but rath-
er of weakness.
Returning to the
basics to recreate
political principles.
These five core principles are at
the center of pragmatic liberalism.
But beyond being simply principles,
they are a foundation for a pragmatic
and progressive way of analyzing
current events and forming opinions.
After all, part of the college experi-
ence is building the necessary tools
to make sense of the world. I don't
consider these principles as a means
of political persuasion - I find them
to be important guiding principles in
my day-to-day life.
I certainly don't hold a copyright
on these principles, nor do I wish to
impose them on anyone. ButI do think
I can contribute to our dialogue by
sharing them and that hopefully some
of you will find them helpful. After all,
it's back to basics, or, in my case, back to
watching Garten on the Food Network.

Blind Pig brings the fun
with a band called fun.
Former Format frontman

A funeral for
'Four Weddings'

comes to Ann Arbor with
new peppy pop outfit fun.
for lone headlining show
By DAVID RIVA
Daily Arts Writer
Hardly any good ever comes from a band
break-up. McCartney and Lennon apart never
reached the same songwrit-
ing heights that they did
together. When Diana Ross
went solo, a member of The Tomorrow
Supremes died. And Billy at 8p.m.
Corgan is hardly worth a The Blind Pig
mention without the original Tickets $15
Smashing Pumpkins' lineup.
Nate Ruess defied the odds
of a floundering career after his former band,
indie-pop outfit The Format, split in February
2008 at the pinnacle of its creative, commer-
cial and critical success.
He didn't waste much time starting a new
project as he gathered musicians from Steel
Train and Anathallo to form a three-piece
with a name that, despite its brevity, reads
like a lighthearted mission statement. The
band, "fun.," jumped into the studio to record
Aim and Ignite, a collection of danceable yet
thought-provoking pop songs, in August 2008.
Since then the band has seen a whirlwind of
online promotion, touring, year-end list nods
and a win at the Independent Music Awards -
a contest judged by some of the industry's most
respected names, including Tom Waits, Mark
Hoppus and M. Ward.
For Ruess, the lead singer of fun., the award
for Best Pop/Rock Song was both unexpected
and humbling.
"I truthfully didn't know what (the award)
was," he said. "But I think that it's a really
cool thing (especially) when I heard about the
people that were on the panel. It was exciting
to actually win an award. I don't know if we
deserved it, but I'll take it."
This success didn't happen in a vacuum,
however, as Ruess used a change in scenery
to motivate himself before he started with his
new creative endeavor.

Try as they might, four women
can't all have the best wedding ever.
So "Four Weddings" pits some pug-
nacious brides
against each other **
in 'a challenge to
have the perfect Four
wedding day - or
at least more per- WeddingS
fect than anyone Fridays at
else. 10 p.m.
A show based TLC
on four women
competing for the
best weddingis pretty much guaran-
teed to be uncomfortable to watch.
The gaggle of women attend each
other's weddings in clumps, and
give rankings afterward regarding
one another's venue, food, dress,.
general experience and originality.
The grand prize is a vacation on an
unknown exotic island.
The participants always have
somethingnegative to say. They snort
at the construction of the programs
or complain they didn't have time to
tryallthe desserts theywanted to. In
the premiere, one woman described
the wedding hotel as looking like a
flying saucer. The Hindi woman who
wanted a traditional Indian wed-
ding received a lot of snide "What is
that?" comments about the food, as
well as criticism for the traditional
nature of her vows.
But the Indian wedding was not
the only one to get flack for its reli-
gious practices. The whining posse
of predictably pissy prima donnas
popped up again at the Catholic
woman's wedding to complain about
all of the "getting up, sitting down,
getting up" at a traditional Catho-
lic service. Those poor little crea-
tures had to exercise their calves on
account of someone else's beliefs.
How they survived the experience
is a question viewers are undoubt-
edly still dying to discover. Even
when the competitors were forced
to admit something was well done,
it was always with a sheen of bitter-

ness and an expression only a facial
twitch away from a glare.
The name "Four Weddings" could
be areference to Hugh Grant's ("Love
Actually") romantic comedy "Four
Weddings and a Funeral," which
follows Grant's character Charles as
he attends wedding after wedding,
bemoaning his inability to commit to
a woman. Sadly, the TV show doesn't
live up to its namesake's success,
though there are moments when the
voices of the competitors fade to the
background and the weddings them-
selves become somewhat appealing
to watch.
Take the instance when the cler-
gyman at one wedding fails to show
up on time, but a member of the
bridal party swoops in and reveals
himself as a priest. Moments such
as these are mildly entertaining, and
add to the beauty of the actual wed-
dings.
If there's one redeeming quality to
"Four Weddings," it's that the show
at least offers a kind of poetic jus-
tice. For once in reality TV, the least
bitchy woman wins. Not the woman
Nuptials aren't
meant to
be ranked.
who gave up her honeymoon cash for
a more expensive wedding, and not
the woman who shrilly announced
in a side interview that she wouldn't
have done anything differently after
losing the competition. No, instead
it's the slightly overweight, motor-
cycle-riding woman who announced
at the outset she wasn't into mushy
heart-shaped cakes. She was also the
only individual to ask the rest of the
women if they were nervous as they
waited for the results of the compe-
tition, only to receive two "no"s and
a "sorta." Hubris doesn't win out in
the end, and that-is, without ques-
tion, a relief.

tired of Arizona," he explained, adding that he
was "so used to being in Arizona that it made
me a little complacent sometimes in my writ-
ing, whereas New York felt like a different
energy."
The fruits of this fresh, lively spirit can be
heard throughout Aim and Ignite. Fusing an
element of Broadway show tunes with exu-
berant guitar and drum parts, the record will
make you feel like you're floating on air. Ruess's
sincere yet snarky lyrics add an emotional pull
without being too serious, contributing to the
album's overall feel-good vibe.
Still, in the 21st century it doesn't matter
how unique or exceptional your product is -
getting it out to listeners is always a daunting
challenge.
Releasing its first single through Facebook,
streaming the full album on MySpace, creating
a free iPhone app and liberally using Twitter,
the band was able toput its music into people's
homes and heads without breaking the bank.
"The Internet definitely helps with (promo-
tion)," Ruess said. "I think we're working at a
really great pace and we're working at a very

affordable pace for ourselves."
Online promotion is not the only answer
for taking a band to the next level. The band
apparently understands the importance of
touring, as Ruess and Co. will be on the road
until mid-May.
Their itinerary is filled with opening dates
for pop-rock powerhouses like Motion City
Soundtrack and Jack's Mannequin and a lone
headlining show in Ann Arbor this Thursday.
Ruess admits headlining is the ideal situa-
tion for fun.'s live show.
"You want to be able to play your full-on
set," he said. "You want to know that the crowd
is there for you."
While admitting that opening for bands is
the "smart" thing to do, Ruess said, "It's going
to be niceto getaway and be ableto do our show,
especially at a place as cool as theBlind Pig," cit-
ing the club as one of his favorite venues (Ruess
has performed twice there with The Format).
With this rare headlining date, an opportu-
nity is presented for band and audience alike
to rock out, hop around and, quite simply, to
have fun.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Wednesday, February 24, 2010 - 7A

NCAA probe far from over for the University, experts say

From Page 1A
enough evidence for the Infractions
Committee to make the finding that
there was a violation," Potuto said.
' Potuto - who said she couldn't
comment on the NCAA allegations
specifically brought against the
Michigan football team, but rather
only on the general allegation and
penalty process - said that typi-
cally, a university will agree with
the alleged violations brought forth
by the NCAA.
"There isn't going to be an argu-
ment about did it occur, or did it not
occur," Potuto said. "The argument
will be about how much responsi-
bility should be taken here, how big
* was the violation and what kinds of
penalties should happen."
But until the hearing, Potuto, who
is now a law professor at the Univer-
sity of Nebraska and represents that
school on NCAA committees, said
a university faced with NCAA alle-
gations must put a lot of time into
responding to the allegations.
"Between now and the Com-
mittee on Infractions hearing and
any findings by the Committee on
Infractions, it's a major distraction
for a university, for anybody else
who's involved," Potuto said. "It's
going to take a lot of person hours
to get together, write the response,
to get together all the exhibits, and
that's also true if there's anybody at
risk."
Potuto said if allegations are
made against specific individuals,
a university not only has to deal
with the repercussions for the insti-
tution, but also probable internal
problems.
"It's not a happy place to be in
terms of negative publicity that just
the allegations bring," Potuto said.
Potuto said NCAA allegations
allow an institution the opportunity
to reassess its conduct and to make
revisions when necessary.
"If the university is doing things
right, it's a time to really take a look
at how it was doing things in the
past and to consider whether there
are different ways of doing things or
better ways of doing things," Potuto
said. "To the extent that there are
individuals who have been alleged
to commit violations, the univer-
sity also has personnel issues, so all
that's going on."
The five allegations brought
against the Michigan football team
include exceeding the amount of
permissible practice time during

the on- and off-seasons and exceed-
ing the number of coaches allowed
to be present at certain activities by
five coaches.
Another violation is that Alex
Herron, a graduate assistant foot-
ball coach, "(provided) false and
misleading information to the insti-
tution and enforcement staff when
questioned about his involvement
in and knowledge of possible NCAA
violations," according to the NCAA's
Notice of Allegations sent to Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman.
Michigan Football coach Rich
Rodriguez's and the University's
Athletic Department's alleged fail-
ure to monitor the football team's
compliance with the NCAA bylaws
are also under review.
Though Potuto said individuals
may be involved in NCAA cases like
this, allegations brought against a
university always "involve institu-
tional responsibility."
"So anything any of those people
do that's a violation of a bylaw is also
the university'sviolation of a bylaw,
so that's the way it works," Potuto
said.
Potuto said the allegation thatthe
football team exceeded the number
of coaches allowed to be present
when "quality control staff mem-
bers...engaged in on- and off-field
activities" applies to the NCAA's
defining coaches not by their title,
but rather by what they do.
Michael Buckner, a lawyer with
Florida-based Michael L. Buckner
Law Firm who provides consult-
ing to universities on NCAA cases,
said he is "surprised" at the football
program's alleged non-compliance
with NCAA bylaws.
"With such a large program, and
important program and prestigious
program such as Michigan, when
out-of-season workouts still garner
attention from people across the
region, I was just surprised that no
one in the institution caught the fact
that there were coaches, assistant
coaches that were conducting sev-
eral practices," Buckner said.
Buckner said he's surprised
that the University's compliance
staff, which works to make sure
the University's athletic programs
are abiding by NCAA rules, didn't,
according to the recent allegations,
monitor the football team closely
enough.
"Every NCAA member institu-
tion has to have a compliance offi-
cer, and in this institution because
of the significant resources of the

JAKE FROMM/Daily
University President Mary Sue Coleman and head football coach Rich Rodriguez look on at a press conference yesterday announcing the NCAA investigation's findings.

institution Michigan has, it's impor-
tant to have a large compliance
staff," Buckner said.
Buckner said he thinks the Uni-
versity could face penalties like pro-
bation for a two to three year period,
a reduction in practice time and a.
decrease in the number of coaches
who can participate at practices.
In addition, Buckner said he thinks
the University will be mandated to
report to the NCAA's Committee on
infractions on a more frequent basis.
"I think there will be some signif-
icant penalties comingup," Buckner
said.
Attorney Mark Jones worked on
the NCAA's enforcement staff for
18 years and worked as the NCAA
Managing Director of Enforcement
before moving to the Indianapolis-
based Ice Miller Law Firm, accord-
ing to the firm's website.
Jones said in an interview yester-
day that while the charges brought
against the Michigan football team
are a "serious matter," it is reassur-
ing that the allegations don't involve
student-athletes, which often result
in more severe penalties for a uni-
versity.
Jones - who has consulted with

universities regarding NCAA alle-
gations - said the penalties the
infractions committee decides on
will be based on the "competitive
advantage" deduced.
Jones said the allegation regard-
ing exceeding off-season practice
times has become a commonly
found violation in recent years, add-
ing that he believes the NCAA has
increased its efforts to find univer-
sity infractions in this area.
"They don't want the athletes
to have the training all the time,"
Jones said. "They want them to
experience the student-athlete life,
so to speak, and so I think there's
more attention brought to this area
over the past few years."
Jones said he's "not shocked" by
the allegations brought against the
football program, though he can't
predict what the end result of the
process will be.
He added that the outcome will
be greatly affected by the testimo-
nies of those who spoke with the
Detroit Free Press last August for
the report in which concerns over
possible violations first surfaced.
"It certainly depends upon the
reliability of the witnesses...," Jones

said. "If those same individuals
report the same information then
you conduct more inquiry and maybe
it's a basis to confirm whether the
violations occurred. The individu-
als who talk to the media, often they
don't want to cooperate...you never
know what's going to happen."
Student-athletes also often think
they're exceeding permissible prac-
tice time limits when in actuality
this may not be the case, Jones said.
"It's not unusual for an athlete,
to believe that they're practicing or
working out more than they're sup-
pose to under the rules," Jones said.
"Then you go and investigate it and
you find out that maybe they were
mistaken about how the rules were
applied or maybe they didn't really
know, or maybe you talk to other
athletes and they don't cooperate,
so it's often sometimes difficult to
know how to assess the evidence in
those types of cases to have enough
to make an allegation."
Jones said the fates of coaches
who face NCAA violations var-
ies, so the fact that fodriguez will
remain the football coach isn't-alto
gether surprising, though universi-
ties sometimes follow through with

"disciplinary action against coach-
ing staff."
"It varies.from case to case and a
lot of times I think it varies on the
institution's position on the viola-
tion and also the coach staff member
and also the institution's view as to
whether or not there was an intent
to try to get an advantage or to try
and circumvent their compliance
program or things of that nature,"
Jones said. "There's a lot of different
factors you have to evaluate before
you decide to terminate a coach. It's
a big decision and obviously Michi-
gan didn't think it was the appropri-
ate thing to do this time."
Along those same lines, Buckner
said he thinks multiple University
of Michigan officials should be held
responsible for the alleged viola-
tions including the University's
compliance staff, Coleman, Rodri-
guez and the other football coaches.
"Michigan should, as any NCAA
institution should, be practicing
what's called 'sheer responsibility,'
" Buckner said. "...Everyone shares
responsibility in these violations."

Terrible shooting plagues
'M' in tough loss at home

Wolverines shot
under 25 percent
from the field against
Fighting Illini
By CHRIS MESZAROS
Daily SportsEditor
It's not often that junior guard
Manny Harris misses a layup.
And for the Michigan men's
basketball team, when he misses
four of them - some of them on
fast breaks - it's not a good sign.
In yester-
day's 51-44 ILLINOIS 51
loss to Illi- MICHIGAN 44
nois, it sim-
ply epitomized the Wolverines'
problems.
From the get-go, Michigan
never really got in sync. The Wol-
verines hit just 1-of-tO to start the
game, their sole basket coming off
a three by sophomore guard Zack
Novak.
In fact, it looked like Novak was
the only one who came to play,
scoring 12 points - one shy of the
team-high 13, scored by Harris
But beyond that, the Wolver-
ines' shooting was simply dread-
ful.

Michigan shot 24.6 percent in
the contest and just over 19 per-
cent from behind the arc.
"They're shooting not to
miss," Michigan coach John
Beilein said. "Or they're think-
ing tlhey're going to get fouled
and we just aren't clean with
what we're doing. They're think-
ing too much. It's a shame right
now because I really thought we
played one of our best defensive
games of the year."
That defense helped the Wol-
verines (6-9 Big Ten, 13-14 over-
all) stay in the contest, despite
the lackluster field-goal percent-
age.
Down 41-35 with just over six
minutes to play, Michigan looked
poised to make a comeback.
Just then, Harris stole the ball,
drove up court and looked to
have an easy layup. But instead of
making the routine play, the ball
clanked off the iron and into the
hands of Illinois center Mike Tis-
dale.
"Definitely frustrating, it's
something that all my life I've
been able to do," Harris said of his
missed layups. "When you get out
there and get right to the rim and
miss it, it's frustrating.
While Michigan has strug-
gled shooting all season, its two

stars, Harris and senior forward
DeShawn Sims are usually reli-
able.
But not last night. Harris shot
5-of-17 and Sims's impact was
largely nonexistent, as he got into
foul trouble and scored just seven
points.
Despite Michigan's poor shoot-
ing - particularly in the first
half when the team shot just 20
percent - Illinois turnovers kept
the Wolverines in the game. The
Fighting Illini turned it over
17 times, which prevented any
lengthy second-half runs.
And even with two minutes
left, Illinois (10-5,18-10) had just a
four-point lead and hadn't scored
a basket in the previous three
minutes, putting Michigan in a
manageable situation.
With the shot clock ticking
down, freshman guard Darius
Morris poked the ball away from
Illinois's Demetri McCamey.
After DJ Richardson picked up
the loose ball for the Fighting
Illini, he chucked it up just as the
shot clock expired.
Tisdale was there once again to
grab the offensive rebound. From
there, McCamey dished the alley-
oop to Mike Davis and it looked
like Michigan's chances were
over.

While Harris and Sims had
off nights, the rest of the team
besides Novak was worse.
Sophomore Laval Lucas Perry
continued his slump, scoring no
points and extending his score-
less streak to two games. Fellow
sophomore Stu Douglass matched
him, shooting 0-for-8 in the con-
test including five misses from
behind the arc.
"Stu's not alone, he's not the
lone ranger here," Beilein said.
"There's a lot of guys. Laval, its
been a longtime since he's made a
shot out there."
It drew a stark contrast to the
two recent road games in Min-
nesota and Iowa where the Wol-
verines shot over 50 percent from
downtown.
But after two straight loss-
es and with just three games
remaining in the season, it is get-
ting hard for the team toput aside
all the negatives that have mount-
ed so far.
"It's all mental for everybody
on the team. All mental," Mor-
ris said. "You've just got to go out
there and believe. I feel like a lot
of people are not believing and
that's a part. You've got to have
faith and yourself and in your
team and what we're trying to
accomplish."

NCAA violations

Sims invisible in loss to Fighting Illini

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily SportsEditor
Everywhere you looked, there
was a problem. Everywhere you
looked, there was a culprit, some-
one or something to blame for
Michigan's latest loss.
But then, seemingly in the mid-
dle of it all, there was someone
missing - the invisible DeShawn
Sims.
He posted seven points, which
would be respectable for any Wol-
verines not named DeShawn Sims
or Manny Harris, but two came
when the game's outcome was
already decided. He sat out a large
part of the second half due to foul
trouble, eventually succumbing to
his fifth in the game's final min-
ute. And perhaps most frustrating
for the Wolverines, when the out-
side shooters struggled, he wasn't
there to take the ball in the paint
and give the Michigan offense
another dimension.
It hasn't been a secret this year
- the Michigan men's basketball
team goes as Sims goes. He's more
than just a backup plan, and his
role on the team goes beyond his
points down low. Though there
were plenty of concerns after the
Wolverines' loss last night, Sims's
seven points certainly stood out.
The only times Sims has scored
fewer than seven in a game this
season? A pair of four-point per-
formances, in - not surprisingly
- two Michigan losses (Boston
College and Northwestern).
"I don't know how many shots
I took, but I wasn't efficient," said
Sims, whose stat line read 3-for-
12 from the field. "I guess offense
wasn't clicking for me today. The
team went otherwise."
But when the team plays with-
out Sims at his best, it often strug-
gles. The Wolverines don't just

miss his scoring, either. It's his
height down low, his rebounding
and the way he draws defenders.
Sophomore guard Stu Dou-
glass said it's "hard to kind of
get things going" without much
action from Sims, whom Douglass
called "arguably the best low-post
offensive big man in the Big Ten -
maybe sporadically, but at times,
he can be unstoppable."
"We've been going through
him a lot this year," Douglass said.
Douglass said the team didn't
ignore the Sims-in-the-post
option during practice this week,
but it wasn't as available yes-
terday as it has been in recent
games. The Fighting Illini had
a considerable size advantage,
with two 6-foot-9 guys and a
7-foot-1 center in their starting
lineup. That, undoubtedly, made
the game plan a bit more difficult
to execute.
Sims mostly worked against
the 7-foot-1 junior Mike Tisdale,
and after the game, Illinois coach
Bruce Weber said he was pleased
with the way Tisdale guarded
Sims.
"(Sims is) 6-7-and-a-half up
against a 7-1 guy, for some reason
it wasn't working with him today,
for obvious reasons, I should say,"
Michigan coach John Beilein said.
"He's not going to post up and
score over the guy inside. He had
a couple of wrinkles that I think
he could have got there, but did
not have a great game."
Both Beilein and Douglass
made note of senior forward Zack
Gibson's performance in Sims's
absence, and spoke highly of the
6-foot-10 big man whose playing
time has fluctuated all season.
Douglass said Gibson provided
a spark to' the team during the
game's second half. Beilein went
so far as to call Gibson's recent

Finally, the suspense is over.
Nearly six months ago,
when the Detroit Free Press
published a report saying Michigan
football players were being over-
practiced, the internet was ina fren-
zy and Michigan
fans came out
in droves to
talk about the
once-lofty moral'
values of their.
program gone
awry. .,
And outside RYAN
of the initial KARTJE
backlash of the
story, the reac-
tions were the same: Don't most
football programs overpractice their
players? What does overpracticing
mean per se? Confusion ensued.
There were West Virginian tears.
Defecting players. Angry fans. Dis-
appointed alumni. You name it.
It seemed like just about every-
one had had enough of the new
direction in which Michigan coach
Rich Rodriguez was taking the
football program - one that had
been defined by inexcusable losses,
a botched drug deal and possible
NCAA violations.
But with yesterday's announce-
ment that the football program was
indeed found to have committed
NCAA violations, despite a continu-
ing firestorm of mistakes made in
the RichRod era, all IScan think
about is how much worse the situa-
tion could be.
Looking through the five viola-
tions with a fine-toothed comb, it's
hard to find anything resembling a
"major" violation.
Sure, the environment Rodri-
guez and the athletic department
promoted may not have "assured
compliance." A graduate assistant
may have lied. And the quality
control assistants may have partici-
pated in a practice or two.
Hell, they may have even forgot
to count stretching as part of the
countable practice hours.
Butwhen I think of major NCAA
violations, I think of recruiting
fraud, paying players, cheating on
tests and other obvious fraudulent
charges that border on criminal
- not a few extra wind sprints for
skipping class.
Clearly, the athletic department
didn't think there was much of a
problem, either, as it stood by while
Rodriguez promoted one of those
quality control assistants - Adam
Braithwaite - to fill the Wolver-
ines' vacant assistant coaching
position.

In no way am I condoning the
alleged actions, which incoming
Athletic Director David Brandon
called "internal confusion." I'm
sure there were a whole lot of con-
fused participants in this charade.
Whether they should have been so
ignorant, we may never know.
But I can't help but look out West
and see schools like USC under the
microscope with much more seri-
ous NCAA violations and think,
"This isn't so bad."
In a salacious scandal that
involved houses and cash for former
Heisman-winner Reggie Bush as
well as possible recruiting violations
regarding star basketball player O.J.
Mayo, the Trojans are in deep.
The difference with USC is that
its football coach from when these
possible violations took place -
now with the Seattle Seahawks -
just happened tobea patron saint
of Los Angeles.
And Rich Rodriguez, well, he
won't be canonized in Ann Arbor
any time soon.
Rodriguez's stock continues to
fall in an awful bout of bad karma
and questionable decision-making.
By now, I'm sure he realizes he's not
in West Virginia anymore.
These violations, in addition to
his signing day fiasco involving
blue-chip recruit and suspected
felon Demar Dorsey have made his
seat scolding hot in 2010.
Still, Brandon made it clear
that rash decisions won't be made
this offseason on the Wolverines'
embattled coach.
"Rich Rodriguez is our football
coach, and he will be our football
coach," Brandon said.
In the end, these NCAA viola-
tions will most likely have little
effect in tarnishing the Michigan
tradition. Sure, the Wolverines will
no longer have the spotless record
they once had. And there's some-
thing to be said about the program's
image, in that sense.
Truth be told though, a slap
on the wrist, probation sod a few
docked scholarships probably won't
do much to derail the entity that is
Michigan football.
It's Rodriguez who stands to suf-
fer from this. After all, for a coach
who has already pushed his luck
with the Michigan fan base, with
the baggage of a $2.5 million buyout
from Morgantown and little on-
the-field success, these violations
could be the straw that broke the
camel's back come next offseason.

Senior DeShawn Sims scored just seven points in last night's loss to Illinois. He
fouled out with 28.7 seconds left in the game.

play a "bright spot" during the
team's latest "funk."
Though Michigan is trying its
best to find and focus on positives
right now, like Gibson's perfor-
mance, doesn't exactly make up
for the glaring absence of Sims,
one of the Wolverines' most
important players.

After Sims fouled out with 28.7
seconds remaining in yesterday's
game, at the end of the de-facto
senior day, the student section
chanted an appreciative "Thank
you, Peedi," referencing the four
years of work he's put in.
Maybe he wasn't invisible after
all.

Unlike past senior nights, this year's holds
postseason implications for Wolverines

By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily Sports Writer
In the past, senior night for the
Michigan hockey team hasn't been
all that climactic. Usually, there's
no lingering possibility that this
could be the last game in front of
the home crowd; usually, the Wol-
verines have already guaranteed
themselves a home playoff series in
the coming weeks.
That won't be the case this year.
Michigan currently sits in sev-
enth in the CCHA. The team must
win Thursday against Notre Dame
and then in South Bend on Satur-
day to negate any chance Michigan
has of falling below the eighth spot
and losing home-ice advantage in
the opening round.
More than anything, earning
extra time at Yost Ice Arena for
a playoff series is on the seniors'
minds as Thursday quietly

approaches.
"I think the time it will set in is
actually when I know I play my last
game here," senior defenseman
Steve Kampfer said yesterday. "But
I think Thursday night will kind of
be a wake up for me, but not right
now. It hasn't set in at all."
And Michigan coach Red Beren-
son wouldn't have it any other way.
The coaching staff scheduled the
game on a Thursday so that stu-
dents could be there to support the
seniors. But he remembers good
and bad performances from his
seniors in the past. Because of this,
he won't even mention the event to
his team this week.
"I've gone so far as, 'this game's
for the seniors,' and we stunk the
joint out," Berenson said. "You
never know what the emotional
trigger is, butI don't think it works
for us."
The 2010 class - consisting

of Kampfer, fellow defensemen
Chris Summers and Eric Elmblad
and forwards Brian Lebler and
Anthony Ciraulo - already knows
that this regular season will be
the worst of its career at Michi-
gan. Barring a run to the CCHA
Tournament Championship, the
Wolverines will also miss out on
their first NCAA tournament in 20
years.
Despite the comparatively poor
season this year, the class has a
CCHA title and NCAA Frozen
Four appearance to their credit
(both in 2008). They are also
nearly 60 games over .500 in their
time wearing the winged helmet,
including a 55-16-3 record at Yost.
Even with more games to play in
the season and Berenson's opposi-
tion to building up senior night
emotionally, the team recognizes
that it will be different from a nor-
mal game. At the very least, the

Wolverines' post-game routine
will be different, if the game itself
doesn't seem abnormal.
"It's obviously going to be a
pretty emotional affair," Sum-
mers said. "It is every year for the
seniors, even the guys that aren't
seniors, seeing them do that whole
ceremony after the game."
As for who will get the most
emotional, how about a 6-foot-3
inch, 212-pound Canadian?
Both Summers and Kampfer
joked that Lebler, the Penticton,
British Columbia native, will get
the most emotional when his name
gets called over the loud speaker.
"When I came in here I never
thought that Brian would be a
softie," Kampfer said with a grin.
"I think now he's a softie. He's
going to be the one that's going to
tear up the most. There's been a
couple of times he's choked up in
meetings.

PERSONALSTATEMENT

A CONVOY IN CONFLICT,
BYAHMAD HASAN

F ollowing Israel's bombardment of
the Gaza Strip last winter, George
Galloway, a member of the British
Parliament known for his support of
the Palestinian cause in the Arab-Isra-
li conflict, embarked on a nationwide
tour in the U.S. calling for Americans
to take action and help the people in
Gaza exercise their right to live freely.
He emphasized that change will
not be realized until citizens of the
U.S. stand up and tell Israel its unilat-
eral siege of the Gaza Strip cannot be
tolerated. According to Galloway, the
most tangible way to help would be to
send a humanitarian aid convoy to the
besieged area.
Attending his stops in Ann Arbor
and Dearborn, I was inspired by his
words and ready to take action. A few
weeks after Galloway's trip through
the Midwest, a group of students from
the University created an organization
known as ActionGAZA.
Fast-forward to October 2009, and
the group found itself collaborating
with Viva Palestina - an organiza-
tion led by Galloway. In November,
ActionGAZA decided to send money
we had raised with Viva Palestina's
December convoy. In an effort to
ensure that our money would be used
to buy necessary medical equipment
for the impoverished Palestinians in
Gaza, I signed up to travel with the
convoy. While I understood the dan-
gers and risks involved with the trip,
I was totally unprepared for what was
in store.
On December24,tarrived in Amman,
Jordan, and took a five-hour taxi ride to
Aqaba, a southern coastal city in Jordan.
LANDSCAPE
From Page 5B
"There's growing awareness
about this kind of thing in the U.S.
and worldwide," he said. "So we get
swamped with c-mails from people
who are interested in this sort of
thing. But whatever the routes are,
they don't include the University."
Steve and Rachel Kaplan have been
at the University for 52 years. They
said in that time, they have watched
campus become less and less focused
on the natural environment.
"It's easy to lose track of how
important the trees are," Steve

Upon arrival, I realized how large our
convoy was and how many trucks of aid
we had. This had been Galloway's third
convoy in one year and was by far his
largest, with 515 participants and 250
trucks ready to be filled with medical
aid, food and clothing.
The medical supplies had already
been purchased in Amman but were
not set to arrive until the next morn-
ing. The plan was to load up the trucks
the next day and leave for Egypt that
evening. From the port of Aqaba, we
would sail to Nuweiba, Egypt, and
drive to Rafah, which borders Gaza.
Egypt had been notified of the con-
voy's plans, expressed its support and
posed no problems to the route we had
chosen. However, it wasn't until we
arrived in Aqaba, filled our trucks with
the supplies and prepared to leave that
Egypt suddenly imposed a new policy:
to enter Gaza, we had to abide bythree
guidelines.
First, the Egyptian Authority made
it impermissible to sail from the portof
Aqaba to Nuweiba, statingthatour only
option would be to sail from Latakia,
Syria, to El-Arish, Egypt. This would
mean traveling backwards hundreds
of miles - a waste of time, money and
energy. Second, Egypt demanded we
coordinate our efforts with the Unit-
ed Nations Relief and Works Agency,
therebysurrendering all humanitarian
aid to the United Nations. Third, the
Egyptian authorities demanded the
convoy's leaders must negotiate with
Israel to get into Gaza, despite the ille-
gality of Israel's occupation ofthe Gaza
Strip accordingto international law.
We drove hundreds of miles back
Kaplan said. "And you would think
since there's a lot of mental fatigue at
a university, it would be a high prior-
ity for things that include trees, and
it's not clear that that's the case."
One aspect of campus that has
remained focused on the natural
environment, however, is the Arb.
Bob Grese, director of Nichol's Arbo-
retum and the Matthaei Botanical
Gardens, said the space often serves
as diversion for students.
"I think the Arb is an escape for
students. It's a place to hang out. It's
a place to get away from some of the
hustle and bustle of campus," he said.
"It's a place for immersing yourself in
a more natural setting, taking walks,

still far from entering Gaza.
After landing, we immediately
headed for the seaport to regain con-
trol of our trucks. Upon arrival, we
were locked in and barred from leav-
ing. Although we had made it to the
port, Egypt created another obstacle
for our convoy - refusing to let 50
of our trucks in and stating the only
way for any to get in was to send them
to Latakia, Syria and remained there, through an Israeli checkpoint.

and began our exploration of Gaza.
We visited about 25 families, all of
whom had experienced some kind of
loss and grief as a result of the previ-
ous winter. It seemed as though every
family we encountered had suffered
the death of at least three immediate
family members.
Of those visited, we had the honor
to meet the Samouni family. Thirty
two members of the Samouni family
were killed by Israel during its assault.
Subhi Samouni, the only man left in
the family, begged me to adopt his
eight-month-old orphaned nephew,
Mohammad.
That night, we were informed that
the Egyptian Authority had demand-
ed George Galloway leave and our
period of stay had suddenly been cut
to 36 hours. As we tried to tour the rest
of Gaza and examine the destruction
from the previous year's attack, we
heard bombing. We were later noti-
fied that Israel had dropped bombs
onthe tunnels running between Gaza
and Rafah, killing three Palestinians.
Shortly thereafter, we heard that
Galloway had been forcefully taken
out of Gaza, police-escorted to Cairo
International Airport and deported.
A few hours later, we went through
the same process: the entire convoy
was put on Egyptian buses and police-
escorted to the airport. We were
detained for hours, some of us even
days, and deported as well.
I returned home confused, tired
and almost oblivious to everything
that had happened. We had succeeded
in breaking the siege, but there was
still so much more to do. As humans,
we cannot sit in silence while nearly
two million people starve to death
under a morally reprehensible and
illegal siege. Israel will continue to
undermine its own security and legit-
imacy the harder it tries to crush the
Palestinians' desire to live free and
dignified lives.

In this planning with the new
hospital, Grese is implementing the
results of research that the Kaplans
have known for years - that the natu-
ral environment has a positive effect
on humans - to liftthe moods of hos-
pital patients. But even for students
who may not realize they're being
influenced, the campus' landscape
architecture has a daily impact.
"A lot of times the way the outside
looks to you actually does have an
influence on you and its got the capac-
ity to make you feel better," Hunter
said. "That's one of the things that
landscape architects take into con-
sideration when they're doing their
designs for outdoor space."

all of those things."
One fourth of the Arb is owned by
the city of Ann Arbor and the Univer-
sity owns the remaining three-quar-
ters. Because of this division, Grese
said he works to serve not only the
University community, but also the
greater Ann Arbor community.
The budget for both the Arb and
the Botanical Gardens is $1.5 million
per year.
Grese has been working with the
designers of the new C.S. Mott's Chil-
dren's Hospital and Women's Hospi-
tal, which is being built adjacent to
the Arb, to make sure patients have a
good view of the scenery.
"The idea is to try and encour-

age them to get outside the hospital,
and then potentially they might take
walks in the Arboretum as well," he
said.
There is also a strip ofland between
the Arb and the new building that
Grese is designing as a children's
garden. He said he would like to see
a space that is colorful and welcom-
ing to patients, siblings and parents
- maybe even including a treehouse.
"We're trying to make it a really
child-friendly space so it would be
really enticing and would look fun
from the windows too, so that if you
couldn't get outside, it would be fun
to watch from the windows," Grese
said.

random student interview

Hi. Is this Ben [Last name
redacted]?
This is.
Hi. This is Dani from The Michigan
Daily. I'm conducting the Random
Student Interview...
Uh, sorry, what's your name?
Dani.
I'm scared shitless of these interviews.
I don't want to do it.
Oh please just do it. I'llbe really nice
toyou. I promise.
OK, let's do it.
Are you going anywhere for spring
break?
I am.
Where are you going?
I'm going to Cancun.
That's cool. Have you been to Can-
cunbefore?
Not that I can remember.
[Laughs] Does that mean you've
been and you just don't remember
anything?
Ihonestlyhave no idea. [Pause] I'mjust
kidding. I've never been there before.
Hey, so, people normally ask in this
interview 'How'd you get my number?'

Please don't tell me it was Facebook.
It was Facebook. Are you going to
take your number offnow?
Um ... well I'm more concerned about
my picture.
Oh, I'm looking at your picture -
you have a microphone and a cup.
OK. Yeah, that was karaoke night in,
Windsor, or no, not Windsor, shoot, it
was ... I don't know. It was a Canadian
city.
Ben, I think your memory needs a
little help.
[Laughs] It... it was Niagara Falls actu-
ally. I ended up on that night doing
karaoke with, uh, she was, like, 55
years old, a woman who was in Niagara
Falls for a wedding party.
Oh my god.
And it was kind of awkward because
she was divorced. It was, like, it was
her kid's wedding. She had divorced
her husband but her husband was re-
married, so she was kind of there all by
herself.
Was she a cougar?
I think so. I didn't seal the deal to be
honest, but ...

Should have, man.
Yeah, I know.
What's your favorite song to kara-
oke to?
"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough."
"Don't Stop Believin.' " That's a
good one.
No, no, no, no, no. "Don't Stop 'Til You
Get Enough." Michael Jackson.
Oh...that's also a good one.I person-
allylike one's you can really belt out.
"Don't Stop Believin"'is a cliche.
It is. But Ilike it when he talks about
Detroit.
Yeah, my other favorite karaoke song is
"Born In The U.S.A." when I'm doing
karaoke in Canada.
So why do you go karaoke in Cana-
da?
Well, we were doing a trip to New
York in the summer. So we just sort of
stopped over.
So you're just going to Cancun with
your friends - does that mean you
just aren't going 'with your girl-
friend, or you don't have a girl-
friend?
No. I don't have a girlfriend. I'm just

going with my friends because...
It's fun.
Yeah.
Are you gonnalook for agirlin Can-
cun to have some fun with?
More than one.
More than one, huh? So you're that
kind of guy.
I'm just kidding.
I don't think you are.
Um, yeah.1I like my women how I like
my coffee...
Strong?
... the only thing is I don't like coffee.
How do you like your coffee?
I don't like coffee.
You don't like coffee? So you don't
like women?
Something like that.
You don't like women?
I don't know, it's just a funny joke I like
to tell.
Do you tell that to a lot of people?
Only close family members.

n high school, sophomore year
meant sweet 16's and, for most of
my friends, a new car - but not
me.
My carbon-emission minded par-
ents, for what at the time seemed
to be completely illogical reasons,
were of the strong conviction that a
car was not necessary for navigating
our two-mile-radius town. My house
was one half block from school, two
blocks from the modest area known
as "downtown" and less than a mile
from my friends.
Despite the walkability of my town,
my peers drove their Jeeps, Hondas
and BMWs to school and then to the
Panera 20 minutes away for off cam-
pus lunch.
Because of my lack of transporta-
tion - and resolution to participate
in all popular high school culture and
activities - I soon perfected the art of
catching a ride.
Given my high school experience,
adapting to life in Ann Arbor with-
out a car wasn't exceedingly difficult.
Everything a student really needs is
available at Village Apothecary or
White Market, and if a new pair of
boots is absolutely necessary, online
shopping is one click away or the Bri-
arwood Mall is just a quick trip on
the number six bus.
So when I registered for RCHUMS
334: Community Empowerment
Through the Arts - a course that
requires students enrolled to travel
to Detroit once a week to experience
community-based art - I thought
the professors would have already
lined up some form of transportation
for the trips.
But my assumptions were wrong,
and as I scrambled to find a way
to travel between Ann Arbor and
Detroit each week, I recalled a friend

at school in Maine who had raved
about something called Zipcar.
When her small college became
claustrophobic, she could reserve
a set of wheels and drive to nearby
Boston for a change of scenery. It
seemed so simple.
And soI registered with Zipcar - a
national company that allowsindivid-
uals or organizations to buy member-
ships and rent cars for hourlyblocks of

r
,i lA

time - assuming all of my problems
would be solved with a hybrid and a
tank of gas.
As a student, I was able to register
through the University, lowering my
annual membership fee from $50 to
$35 and eliminating the initial reg-
istration fee. Drivers must typically
be 21 years old to use the service, but
when signed up through the Univer-
sity, that number is lowered to 18.

mately, I decided to risk the fee, and
though I pulled into the specified lot
seven minutes late, no late fees were

Though my first experience was
ultimately a success, I haven't booked
a Zipcar since. Its inconvenience and

typical spring afternoon in Ann Arbor: a Fris-
bee whizzing through the air in the Arb; a
lone student resting beneath a tree in the Diag,
listlessly flipping through the pages of a worn
paperback; open lawns scattered throughout campus dot-
ted with hundreds basking in the sun. Appreciated by
most but understood by few, these green spaces of campus
often go unnoticed by the University community beyond
the spring and summer months. But for Ken Rapp, the
University's landscape architect, these areas of refuge are
more than just a comfortable place to lounge when the sun
reemerges in Ann Arbor after dreary, gray winters - they
are his life's work.

Rapp has been employed by the Uni-
versity for 23 years and has seen the
campus evolve in a variety of ways.
"There's not a place on campus
where you can't go to and turn in a
circle and see somethingthat I've done
over that time frame," he said.
His work, landscape architecture,
refers to all aspects of the landscape
- from the plants and trees, to the
walkways and fountains - and the
socio-behavioral and aesthetic out-
comes of these outdoor spaces.
The University first made a major
investment in landscape architecture
in the 1960's, hiring the firm Johnson,
Johnson & Roy to guide the develop-
ment of the University's master plan in
1963. And since then, Rapp and his pre-
decessors have been constantly plan-
ning, designing and redesigning the
University's landscape.
Joan Nassauer, a professor in the
School of Natural Resources, said
the University's landscape exists to
make a lasting first impression and to

please those who are on campus every
day.
"We come here sort of with height-
ened expectations," she said of the
campus community. "(Landscape
architecture) creates an opportunity
to organize the outdoor spaces of a
campus in a way that is essentially wel-
coming to people who are here for a
brief time and that is stimulating in all
the right ways for people that are here
using their minds and growing their
minds."~
She also noted that the landscape of
a university's campus is vastly different
from other types of landscape architec-
ture, such as at corporate buildings or
malls.
"The type of environment that
would be (stimulating for) people who
are here engaged in a scholarly endeav-
or is different from the kinds of envi-
ronment that would be stimulating for
people who are, say, going shopping,"
she said.
Subsequently, Nassauer added, the
type of planning and research that goes

into designing a university campus dif-
fers dramatically from other public
spaces.
Mary Carol Hunter, another profes-
sor in the School of Natural Resources,
said a campus environment is unique
in that people actually live within the
space rather than just observe it.
"For campus you want to have space
for people to just be," Hunter said. "So
you don't want to have it all shrubbed
up and stuff like that. You want to have
spaces that people can move in and out
of and through very easily."
For example, Rapp said the grassy
knolls between Dennison and East
Hall used to be lined with shrubs, but
he decided to remove them to make
the spaces more accessible. He said the
small change has had a huge impact
on how students use the space, which
is now almost always occupied in the
spring and summer.
"Sometimes it's a big change and
sometimes it's a little change, where
you just notice that this would be much
better used if we were to rearrange this
or change something - make it differ-
ent," he said.
Rapp said the University assigns
three levels of priority to areas on cam-
pus. Some places on and around North
Campus are classified as level three,
and receive the lowest level of mainte-
nance to preserve their natural state.
Areas like the Diag and the Law
Quad, which are more trafficked and
historically significant, receive top lev-
els of maintenance. In selecting these
areas - deemed "more iconic spaces"
- Rapp said he thinks about what plac-
es are campus attractions.
"When we started developing the
priority levels, we looked at where are
the places on campus that are destina-
tion points," he said. "Where do people
come to see things on campus?"
As a member of the Midwest Land-
scape Architects and Ground Manag-

ers - an informal group that meets
once a year - Rapp is looking to host
this year's annual event here at the
University this June. He plans to give a
tour of campus and explain University
practices as they relate to architectural
landscaping.
Many Big Ten schools are represent-
ed in the group, along with the Uni-
versity of Nebraska, the University of
Missouri and other large universities
across the country. When compared
to other campuses Rapp has visited in
past years as a member of the group, he
believes the University's is one of the
best in terms of overall look and layout.
Slightly removed from campus,
Rapp's office, along with that of
the Grounds Department, sits
in a building on East Madison. With a
budget of $750,000 a year for internal
projects, the University covers the cost
of plants and installation labor. Rapp
works on about half of the University's
landscape projects, while the other
half is contracted out to independent
landscape architecture firms.
One of these firms, Johnson, John-
son & Roy, was founded in part by Bill
Johnson, a former dean of the School
of Natural Resources at the University.
The firm got its start working for the
University, and now heads up projects
for multiple college campuses around
the country.
The University has hired JJR for a
variety of recentprojects, includingthe
site design for the Ross School of Busi-
ness and the new Hill Dining Center.
The work involved in these projects
includes designing the plans for pave-
ment and landscaping.
Oliver Kiley, a site designer for JJR,
graduated from the School of Natural
Resources' graduate program in 2008.
He said it's sometimes difficult for
people to understand the scope of land-
scape architecture, noting that most

immediately think about residential
landscapes rather than urban land-
scapes like the university campuses.
"If you say that you're an architect,
people are really clear on what that is.
If you say you're a landscape architect,
people think, 'Oh, you're out planting
flowers at someone's house,' "he said.
Before becoming professionals,
landscape architects must pass a
national exam. Kiley will take the first
part of his qualifying test in March.
Nassauer, who served as Kiley's gradu-
ate advisor, said that the exam is in
place to protect public health, as land-
scape architects often create master
city plans that include the designation
of roads and buildings.
Kiley said that students are some-
times oblivious to the history of the
landscape of campus. For example, he
said, the pedestrian mall in between
the Dana Building and the Dennison
Building used to be a road, but due to
safety concerns with so many students
in the area, the University decided to
remove the road.
When a new building is con-
structed or a new space
opens on campus, Rapp's
team typically heads the landscape
planning, unless the University decides
to outsource the project. Many projects
begin in the Architecture, Engineering
and Construction department of the
University, and then the plans make
their way to Rapp's desk.
Once his team decides what spaces
should be occupied by plants, grass and
sidewalks, the Grounds Department's
Forestry and Horticulture staff selects
specific types and species of plants for
the area.
Rapp's team is currently working on
a project to renovate the courtyard in
the Michigan League. The courtyard is
only accessible bya set of steps, and the
University would like to make it wheel-

chair-accessible by adding a ramp.
"It's a little tricky because people
have strong feelings about that space
and there's a lot of historical character
over there," Rapp said of the League.
"So we're trying to be very careful and
respectful to that while we modernize
it and make it more useful to that new
use, new requirements."
Rapp said his job often requires him
to consider the historical character of
campus because when alumni return
to Ann Arbor, they want it to look the
same as when they left.
"No matter how new something is,
we tryto make it look as if it has always
been there," Rapp said.
n the two decades Rapp has been
with the University, researchers
like Nassauer have been working to
find more environmentally sustainable
ways to design landscapes and have
introduced higher standards for suc-
cessful landscapes.
Nassauer came to the University
with the intention to continue her work
on more environmentally sensitive
practices in landscape architecture. In
her time here, she developed the term
"cultural sustainability" - maintain-
ing a balance between environmentally
sustainable practices and fulfilling the
public's expectations of an appealing
landscape.
According to Nassauer, the Univer-
sity has a great opportunity to embrace
this new research and teach these
practices through example to the rest
of the country.
"You don't get people to change by
saying (they) should like something
different. You get people to change by
showing them something different
that they discover they have a positive
response to," she said. "(There is an)
enormous opportunity for the Univer-
sity to construct a landscape that helps
people see the possibilities in a differ-

ent way."
Rapp believes North Campus is
the ideal area to introduce these new
practices. In the process of trying-to
give North Campus its own distinct
identity, the University has increased
measures that emphasize its natural
environment.
The Grounds Department has
stopped mowing one million square
feet of grass on North Campus because
the field was not being used. The grass
will help retain storm water more
effectively if it is left un-mowed.
Two years ago, the University com-
pleted a burnout on North Campus to
mimic the Earth's natural cycle. By
purposefully creating a fire, humans,
can refresh the nutrients in the soil,
benefiting the plant life in the area.
Budget cuts within Rapp's depart-
ment have also spurred sustainabil-
-ity in a roundabout way. Last July, the
University cut funds for annual bulbs -
flowers that bloom seasonally and are
subsequently removed.
The University typically plantsthese
bulbs in the spring to bloom in the fall,
and then replaces them with bulbs that
will bloom in the spring. This past fall,
the flowers were removed on schedule,
but no new bulbs were planted.
Rapp said that while students will
most likely notice the lack of colorful
flowers on campus around the time of
commencement, the change will save
the University $185,000 a year.
"For years, particularly right by Bur--
ton Tower, we've tried to choose tulip
bulbs that will bloom the exact week
of commencement so they're in full
bloom," he said. "I've seen thousands of
students get their picture taken in front
of those tulip bulbs."
Despite the lack of photo opportuni-
ties, Rapp has taken a positive attitude
toward the change, saying it will force
his department to examine the prac-
tice of taking things in and out of the

ground. He said that many of the annu-
al bulbs his team was planting were
meant to grow in the tropics, and the
practic'e of letting them die and then
pulling them up is not a very environ-
mentally sensitive process.
"Our goal is to still keep a lotof color
on campus because it definitely adds to
the atmosphere and the enjoyment of
the campus, but I think we'll be look-
ing at trying to do it in different ways,"
he said.
T hough students will likely miss
the color provided by the annual
bulbs, according to researchers,
the change should not have an effecton
the mood of people on campus.
Professors Steve and Rachel Kaplan
have done extensive research on the
effect of the natural environment on
humans. They said that while color
is attractive, what the mind really
responds to is the presence of trees.
By studying public housing in Chi-
cago, the Kaplans found that residents
who had trees visible from their win-
dows showed a higher capacity to make
long-term goals and greater civility
than residents who did not have visible
trees.
They also found that students suf-
fering from mental fatigue felt better
after taking a walk outside, stating that
these students reported much more
energy after taking a study break to
stroll around outside than they did
after taking a study break to watch
television.
Despite these positive effects, the
Kaplans said the importance of seeing
the natural world, namely trees, is still
largely unrealized by most, including
officials at the University.
Steve Kaplan said that while some
are coming around to the positive
effects of trees, the University is not
among that group.
