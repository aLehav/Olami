RESEARCH

Patients who respond 
to placebo more likely 
to see improvement 
with antidepressants

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

A recent University study 

found that people with depression 
whose symptoms are decreased 
by placebo drugs are also more 
likely to respond when they are 
given real antidepressants. Those 
who don’t respond to the placebo 
are less likely to find relief with 
medication.

The research team, led by Jon-

Kar Zubieta, a former Univer-
sity faculty member who is now 
chair of the psychiatry depart-
ment chair at the University of 
Utah, has been studying the pla-
cebo effect for more than 10 years 
through brain scanning tech-
niques.

The study was conducted with 

35 participants, all with untreat-
ed major depression. The partici-
pants were told they were being 
given a new drug to treat depres-

sion that researchers were look-
ing to test.

Psychiatry Prof. Marta Pecina, 

one of the study’s lead authors, 
said the study had two phases 
in which the patients were first 
given the placebo drugs, and then 
actually treated.

Using 
Positron 
Emis-

sion Tomography, which is a 
brain scanning technique, the 
researchers were able to monitor 
the participant’s brain activity 
throughout the study to deter-
mine the reaction to the placebo 
and actual drug. Researchers saw 
the same changes in brain chem-
istry in patients who responded 
to the placebo pill as they saw in 
patients who actually took the 
antidepressant.

Pecina 
said 
the 
patients 

responding to the placebo could 
essentially “generate their own 
medicine,” which could lead to 
alternative treatments in the 
future, though she acknowledged 
the study wasn’t necessarily rep-
resentative of the whole popula-
tion.

“These people may in general 

have more resilience, and that’s 
a good point,” Pecina said. “Cer-

225 hospital rooms 
now equipped with 
Xbox consoles for 

patient use

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

Scores of patients at C.S. Mott 

Children’s Hospital will now 
have access to personal enter-

tainment systems in their rooms.

On Friday, the hospital cel-

ebrated the launch of the Mott 
Family Network Pediatric Gam-
ing Project, which aims to use 
Xbox 360 and Xbox Live to pro-
vide recreational and therapeu-
tic experiences for patients. So 
far, 225 rooms are set up with the 
Xbox 360 consoles.

The Mott Golf Classic and 

the Mott Family Network, two 
nonprofit organizations with the 
mission of advancing pediatric 

medicine and improving patient 
and family care, funded a large 
portion of the project. The proj-
ect’s initial budget was almost 
$500,000, but with donations 
from the two organizations, the 
project only cost about $100,000 
of hospital funds.

The project began as a smaller 

pilot program last year, with 32 
Xbox consoles in the Hematolo-
gy/Oncology unit at the hospital. 
Jean-Jacques Bouchard, a child 
life specialist, said Mott saw a 

need to implement the gaming 
system hospital-wide to meet 
the recreational, educational and 
therapeutic needs of the hospi-
tal’s patients.

Bouchard said the Xbox gam-

ing system allows patients to be 
treated like normal kids because 
they can interact with their fam-
ily and friends online — even 
when they are at the hospital.

“People who are playing with 

the patients online have no idea

FOOTBALL

Defense dominant 
again in Big Ten 
opener, No. 13 

Northwestern next

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

COLLEGE PARK — In the first 

four games, 36 minutes and 42 
seconds of its season, the Michi-
gan football team did not have 
what one might call a quick-strike 
offense.

But in a span of three min-

utes, 11 seconds during the third 
quarter Saturday, the Wolverines 
pulled away from Maryland in 
their Big Ten opener en route to a 
28-0 win at Byrd Stadium.

Michigan gained possession 

for the 11th time with 8:18 to 

go in the third quarter. At that 
point, the Wolverines led just 
6-0 despite having dominated 
the Terrapins on the defensive 
side of the ball. That dominance 
had gifted the offense yet another 
opportunity, with junior corner-
back Jourdan Lewis’ interception 
giving Michigan the ball at Mary-
land’s 31-yard line.

Within 19 seconds, the Wolver-

ines were in the end zone. After 
two incomplete passes, on 3rd-
and-10, fifth-year senior quarter-
back Jake Rudock dumped off a 
screen to redshirt junior running 
back Drake Johnson, who picked 
up a block on the edge and took it 
in for a touchdown.

“I think 
we 
just calmed 

down, just trusted the process,” 
said junior tight end Jake Butt. 
“There’s no panic on the sideline. 
It was just little things here and

Environmental 

equity cited as city’s 

key concern

By WILL GREENBERG

Daily News Editor

DETROIT — Marching from 

Roosevelt Park to Hart Plaza, 
several groups rallied together 
to support each other’s various 

justice causes.

The Detroit March for Jus-

tice, hosted by the National 
Sierra Club and a variety of 
social justice and environmen-
tal groups, drew Sierra Club 
executives from around the 
country Saturday, including 
club President Aaron Mair.

Represented in the march 

were groups like the East 
Michigan 
Environmental 

Action Council, Water is Life, 

Michigan Welfare Rights Orga-
nization and others. Marchers 
carried signs calling for an end 
to fracking and water shutoffs. 

But many were there in 

defense of Detroit’s air, one of 
the pressing environmental 
issues in the area. One young 
boy wore a sandwich board the 
read: “Most polluted zip code: 
48217.”

 TELEVISED TRIAL

Campus reacts to O.J. verdict

BIKING ON BONISTE E L

Twenty years ago 

this week

On Oct. 3, 1995, O.J. Simp-

son was acquitted of the 
murders of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Gold-
man, 
bringing 
Simpson’s 

eight-month trial to a close.

University students gath-

ered in both public and pri-
vate to watch the verdict 
be handed down. So many 
students were watching the 
verdict that some classes 
were 
canceled. 
Students 

who watched the verdict 
were incredulous, but some 
thought the prosecution did 
not make a strong enough 
case against Simpson.

“Our justice system says 

‘beyond a reasonable doubt,’ 
and I think there’s a lot of 
reasonable doubt,” Business 
student Lisa Monroe said on 
that day.

Communications 

Instructor Trevor Thrall 
worried at the time that the 
Simpson trial would set a 
new precedent for dramatic 
media coverage of national 
trials.

“The media has realized 

that the public has a sort 
of appetite for this sort of 
thing,” Thrall told the Daily. 
“If the news organizations 
… can dramatize a case like 
this again, they will…”

Thirty years ago 

this week

On Oct. 4, 1985, the jour-

nal Science claimed Soviet 
spies were obtaining “mili-
tarily sensitive” information 
from American universities, 
including the University.

The report claimed Soviet 

bloc nations had been procur-
ing this sensitive information 
through research projects, 
trade shows, reports and 
even the U.S. Patent Office. 
Alan Price, then the Univer-
sity’s assistant vice president 
of research, said classified 
military research was diffi-
cult to carry out at the Uni-
versity.

Council to discuss pedestrain 
safety at meeting on Monday

New plot aims 
to bring fresh,
organic produce

 to campus

BY BRANDON 

SUMMERS-MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

Tomatoes and cucumbers 

are ripening in gardens across 
Michigan, including a new plot 
on East Quad’s grounds.

Residential College faculty 

and students gathered out-
side the residence hall Friday 
afternoon to celebrate the 
official opening of the RC Gar-
den, an endeavor jointly led by 
students and faculty to bring 
fresh, organic produce to cam-
pus.

The Eco Club and Food 

Forum, two RC groups created 
to maintain the garden, have 
more than 30 members each 
and say interest is growing.

Though the garden’s con-

cept originated within the RC, 
all University students may 
care for it and harvest produce.

The garden is currently 

growing chives, sweet basil, 
tomatoes, 
cucumbers, 
fruit 

trees, kale, corn and miniature 
watermelons, 
among 
other 

vegetables and plants.

The garden was built and 

developed by the East Quad 
Garden Committee, comprised 
of staff from LSA facilities 
and housing, the University’s 
Landscape Architecture unit, 
East Quad staff and students 
from the RC.

“There was so much inter-

est,” said Kenn Rapp, a Uni-
versity landscape architect and 
committee member. “It was 
such an enthusiastic project to 
work on with a large commit-
tee of people that worked for 
almost three years.”

Rapp 
said 
the 
commit-

tee was tasked with creating 
a vision outlined by the RC, 
which included an emphasis on 
sustainability and the physical 
capability to add to the garden 

in the future.

To incorporate sustainabil-

ity into the design, several spe-
cies of flowers were planted 
within and surrounding the 
garden to attract natural polli-
nators, including bees and but-
terflies.

Pollinators can lay eggs 

in designated stations called 
“pollinator habitats” which are 
located within close proxim-
ity to the garden. The aim is to 
encourage future plant growth 
by creating a stable environ-
ment for pollinators.

“It’s its own little ecosys-

tem,” Rapp said.

RC Lecturer Virginia Mur-

phy, a Program in the Environ-
ment faculty member, helped 
oversee the project’s comple-
tion and said the garden is 
meant to show students that 
healthy food isn’t hard to find.

“We can grow healthy food 

in an urban setting,” she said. 
“Even in the middle of a major 
university campus.”

She said students were a

Search for city 

administrator, bird 
safety also up for 

consideration

BY ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

At their meeting Monday 

evening, Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil is slated to a discuss a series 
of issues, including pedestrian 
safety, finding a new city admin-
istrator, and taking measures to 
protect birds. 

Pedestrian Safety and 
Access Task Force

At a session earlier this month, 

the council heard recommenda-
tions of the Pedestrian Safety 
and Access Task Force, which 
released an extensive study on 
pedestrian safety in Ann Arbor.

Recommendations 
included 

education efforts on traffic laws, 
improving physical conditions 
of the roadway and initiatives to 
reduce distracted driving.

The task force also recom-

mended increasing regulations 
and ordinances regarding snow 
and ice removal in the winter to 
increase pedestrian safety.

Council will vote on the rec-

ommendations Monday.

City Administrator search

Council will also consider a 

resolution to approve the Coun-
cil 
Administration 
Commit-

tee’s recommendations for the 
search for a new city adminis-
trator.

The committee doesn’t have 

final say on who will be selected 
and approved — that ability rests 
with the council members — but 
they are charged with finding at 
least three finalists who are suit-
able for the role.

Current 
City 
Administra-

tor Steve Powers announced he 
was leaving the position in late 
August to accept a position as 
city manager in Salem, Oregon. 
Powers, 
after 
slightly 
more 

than four years in the position, 
will officially vacate the post in 
November.

The council has appointed 

Tom Crawford, the city’s chief 
financial officer, to serve as 
an interim city administrator, 
effective Nov. 18.

Support for Safe Passage 

Great Lakes Days

A resolution to support the 

Safe Passage Great Lake Days is 
also up for consideration.

In 2009, the Ann Arbor joined 

other Michigan cities in passing 
Safe Passage resolutions, which 
makes 
the 
periods 
between 

March 15 and May 31 and 
between Aug. 15 and Oct. 31 desig-
nated as Safe Passage Great Lakes 
days. Since birds use light to 
navigate, residents of Ann Arbor 
are encouraged to turn off lights 
above the fifth floor of buildings 
on those days between 11 p.m. and 
6 a.m. Birds can often be confused 
by well-lit urban areas, 

The council will vote on the 

most recent addition to this reso-
lution, which says the city should 
advise individuals to always turn 
off lights when they leave a build-
ing.

The resolution also encourages 

awareness of the problems light 
poses for birds and asks citizens 
to find ways to light their office 
buildings and homes at night that 
will conserve more of it.

Resolution to approve site 

plan for First Street Housing

The council will review the 

first site plan for a new hous-
ing development on First Street. 
 

The development would be a 
47,1400-square-foot residential 
building with 25 dwelling units. 
There is also a plan to build a 
parking lot for approximately 
35 vehicles underneath the 
apartments.

issues and then we have bad air,” 
said Rhonda Anderson, senior 
organizing representative for the 
Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Cam-
paign and Environmental Justice 
Program. “The bad air is killing us 
just as much as the other issues are 
killing us.”

The Michigan Department of 

Environmental Quality has iden-
tified several power plants in the 
area as the source of high sulfur 
dioxide levels and is working to 
reduce emissions at these plants to 
the safe level of 75 parts per billion.

The MDEQ is currently working 

on a State Implementation Plan to 
achieve proper air quality within 
the area that hasn’t attained safe 
air quality levels, including parts of 
southwest Detroit, running along 
the Canadian border and meeting 
the southern edge of Wayne Coun-
ty’s border.

The Environmental Protection 

Agency must approve this SIP or 
require a different plan.

The sources of the SO2 identi-

fied in the SIP are Carmeuse Lime 

and Stone, U.S. Steel, DTE’s River 
Rouge Power Plant and DTE Tren-
ton Channel Power Plant. EES 
Coke was also identified as a source 
since it provides fuel to U.S. Steel.

The SIP calls for the plants to 

reduce emissions enough to bring 
the area to the safe SO2 amount; 
Carmeuse Lime is planning to build 
a higher smokestack to further dis-
perse its emissions, for example.

While the modeling shows the 

individual plants at safe levels 
under these new guidelines, there 
is a possibility of an unsafe zone, 
or “hotspot,” when the plants com-
bined are operating at full capacity.

Robert Irvine, a representative 

from the MDEQ, said this possibili-
ty is a worst-case scenario, and that 
he stands by his agency’s proposal. 
He added that the MDEQ still 
needs to reply to all public com-
mentary — which closed Monday.

“The level of control at these 

facilities — we consider them to be 
adequate and that is our conclu-
sion in our document at this point,” 
Irvine said in an interview.

While MDEQ members feel 

confident the EPA will agree to 
the plan, the Sierra Club’s Michi-
gan Chapter and members of the 

community believe it doesn’t go far 
enough.

At a public forum held at River 

Rouge High School earlier this 
month, 
MDEQ 
representatives 

took public comments from any-
one who had them, a step required 
in the SIP drafting process. Many 
Sierra Club members and people 
from the area spoke passionately 
about the need for an effective, 
long-term solution to the pollu-
tion, with some talking about their 
friends or family who became sick 
with asthma and other illnesses 
linked to air pollution.

Brad van Guilder, a representa-

tive from the Sierra Club, said the 
permits described in the SIP are 
not enough.

“This is a case where the MDEQ 

has the full legal authority to 
address this, they have the tools 
to be able to address it, they know 
how to do it,” he said in an inter-
view. “They really need to step 
up and either do the right thing, 
or they need to cooperate with 
the EPA and implement a federal 
implementation plan as quickly as 
possible.”

At the march Saturday, attend-

ees echoed these sentiments, with 

many people saying they were 
ready to see improvements after 
years of issues.

“We pray that Detroit stands up 

for everything that we are owed,” 
said Pastor Alonzo Bell through 
a microphone, leading a prayer in 
Roosevelt Park before the march 
began.

Mair, the Sierra Club president, 

marched with the group of about 
400, leading the way and help-
ing to hold a “Black Lives Matter” 
sign. Speaking at Hart Plaza at 
the march’s finish, Mair discussed 
Detroit’s environmental struggles 
in the context of all the city’s jus-
tice issues.

He compared Detroit to the town 

of Rock Ridge in “Blazing Sad-
dles” — a movie where a governor 
attempts to displace town members 
to install a profitable rail line.

“This crime is no coincidence,” 

Mair said. “Now, in the wake of 
global climate change, this is the 
city that can create the green jobs; 
this is the city that can build the 
electric vehicles; this is the city that 
can create the wind turbines; this is 
the city with the workers who are 
ready to work.”

if (the patients) are at the hospi-
tal or at home,” Bouchard said. 
“The patients are treated just 
like normal kids. That is one 
of the biggest benefits of Xbox 
being in their rooms.”

Krystal Sweet, whose son is a 

patient at Mott, said the games 
help her son endure his treat-
ments by allowing him to focus 
on something more enjoyable.

“The games help with the 

treatments because they help 
distract him from the pain and 
makes time go faster for him,” 
Sweet said.

Sweet added that having 

the Xbox in the room is nice 
because she and her son can use 
it to watch movies too, not just 
play games.

Bouchard said since the 

Xbox can play CDs and DVDs 
too, some parents also use the 
system to make a recording of 
their voices for their kids.

“Our music therapist will 

record the parents’ voices (on 
a CD) so if the parents can’t be 
by the bedside all the time, the 
CD will be put into the Xbox 
and the kids can listen to it,” 
Bouchard said.

Engineering 
junior 
Anna 

Dai, who was involved with this 
project since last year, said she 
was got involved after taking an 
entry-level computer engineer-
ing course called “Gaming for 

the Greater Good” with David 
Chesney, a lecturer in computer 
science and engineering. Dai 
said she jumped at the opportu-
nity because she wanted to use 
computer science for humani-
tarian and societal issues.

“I liked the idea of using 

computer science for something 
other than just making com-
puters work faster,” she said. 
“Computer science is powerful 
and there is so much (computer 
science) technology that hasn’t 
been utilized yet. It can be used 
for humanitarian issues to make 
an impact on people’s lives.”

In the future, Dai said orga-

nizers plan to set up gaming 
rooms and mobile Xbox carts 
for patients whose rooms are 
not equipped with the console, 
updating the Xbox 360 con-
soles to Xbox One, and garner-
ing more donations and Xbox 
games.

LSA senior Efrain Segarra, 

who was involved with the 
project at its initial stages, said 
it took a tremendous amount of 
effort to develop and implement 
the initiative, but it was worth it 
at the end.

“It was amazing to learn 

about what it takes to develop 
a project of this magnitude,” 
Segarra said. “And it was very 
heartwarming at the end to put 
in the 32 test units and see how 
excited all the children were 
already.”

there that we were beating our-
selves with.”

Redshirt sophomore tight end 

Khalid Hill caught a short pass 
for the two-point conversion after 
Johnson’s 
touchdown. 
Michi-

gan’s surging defense returned 
to the field on the next series as 
Matt Godin and Mario Ojemudia 
teamed up to sack Maryland back-
up quarterback Daxx Garman on 
third down.

Then the offense headed out 

for a 12th time, and this time it 
only took one play. Redshirt junior 
wide receiver Jehu Chesson broke 
a tackle at the second level and 
took an end-around run 66 yards 
for a touchdown.

Thanks to Maryland’s offen-

sive struggles, the slim 6-0 lead 
seemed more comfortable than it 
appeared on the scoreboard. But 
in just over three minutes, the 
Wolverines’ advantage became 
much safer.

“Collectively, we started play-

ing a little harder,” Johnson said. 
“We started opening up the zone 
running, and that seemed to hit 
them well. The offensive linemen 
started playing really well.”

In the first half, Johnson said 

Michigan unveiled only parts 
of its game plan, testing them 
against the Maryland defense. As 
the game went on, the Wolver-
ines started to go deeper, and the 
offensive line and skill players col-
laborated on ways to attack the 
Terrapins.

The 
second-half 
outburst 

masked some early offensive 
issues. Neither team generated 
a play longer than 20 yards until 
midway 
through 
the 
second 

quarter, and senior kicker Kenny 
Allen’s two short field goals were 
the only points of the half as both 
offenses struggled to move the 
ball.

“The thing I was focused on 

in the first quarter, even midway 
through, is both offenses were just 
making mistakes — penalty, error, 
turnover,” said Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh. “From a coach-
ing perspective, offensively, it was 
really just trying to get our team 
playing better fundamental-tech-
nique, assignment football.”

The Terrapins picked up three 

first downs on their opening drive, 
moving the ball into Michigan ter-
ritory, but couldn’t flip the field 
position after a short punt. The 
Wolverines took advantage of the 
wind at their backs when fifth-
year senior punter Blake O’Neill 
booted a ball out of bounds at the 

one-yard line, away from dan-
gerous Maryland returner Will 
Likely.

Terrapins quarterback Caleb 

Rowe’s interception — his first 
of three — gave the Wolverines 
another chance in Maryland terri-
tory, but this time, Rudock took a 
sack and fumbled on fourth down.

Michigan also turned the ball 

over on its next possession, when 
junior running back Ty Isaac fum-
bled a carry on the first play. It was 
the first fumble of the season for 
a Wolverine running back. Isaac 
fumbled again early in the third 
quarter and did not carry the ball 
again.

“(We) would have liked to have 

done a better job at (avoiding turn-
overs), but when you keep peeling 
it back, every time we made a mis-
take offensively, our defense did 
not allow Maryland to capitalize 
on it,” Harbaugh said. “Three dif-
ferent times, I don’t even know if 
they got any yards when it was all 
said and done.”

In total, the defense allowed 

just 105 yards for the second 
straight week — and no points, 
continuing the streak. After the 
game, Michigan had already set its 
sights on next week’s matchup.

“What do you do next? You have a 

happy flight home,” Harbaugh said. 
“And get ready for Northwestern.”

Members of Know Tomor-

row held a banner urging stu-
dents to stand on the “right side 
of history.” The banner includ-
ed information about recent 
gains in the climate change 
movement, 
including 
Presi-

dent Barack Obama’s August 
announcement of the Clean 
Power Plan, which set new 
regulations for reducing carbon 
emissions from power plants.

LSA junior Samantha Gins-

burg, president of the Universi-
ty’s chapter of Know Tomorrow, 
said she hoped the rally would 
help amplify and synchronize 
youth voices calling for action 
on climate change.

“We know what tomorrow 

looks like,” Ginsburg said. “The 
science is clear — there is no 
more debate. We want action 
because we know what our 
future looks like.”

Know Tomorrow chapters at 

60 campuses across the country 
also held similar climate rallies 
Friday as part of the national 
day of action. Some events had 
high profile speakers such as 
Sen. Edward Markey at Har-
vard University and Robert F. 
Kennedy, Jr. at the University of 
Southern California.

Don Scavia, a Graham Family 

Professor of Sustainability and 

director of the University’s Gra-
ham Sustainability Institute, 
spoke at the rally on campus. 
Scavia urged students to com-
bat climate change, at the per-
sonal and institutional levels.

“There are lots of things you 

can do as individuals to reduce 
your own consumption,” Scavia 
said. “Those individual actions, 
though, won’t be enough — we 
need policy changes at the local, 
state and federal government 
levels.”

The 
Michigan 
Marching 

Band and Jugglers on Campus, 
a student organization, both 
performed at the event. Planet 
Blue and the Divest and Invest 
campaign also had tables dis-
tributing information.

Engineering 
senior 
RJ 

Nakkula said students should 
join the University in its efforts 
to combat climate change.

“The University is making 

steps in the right direction, 
but everyone needs to do their 
share,” Nakkula said. “It’s not 
just the University’s part, it 
comes down to students, too.”

LSA freshman Noah Low-

enstein, a member of Know 
Tomorrow, said the climate 
rally is an important step 
toward 
uniting 
millennials 

around climate change goals.

“We are the millennials,” 

Lowenstein said. “We are the 
ones who will be living on this 
Earth far beyond the policy 

tainly research like this may 
help us to stratify patients 
who would either benefit from 
lower doses of antidepres-
sants or even alternative treat-
ments.”

In a press release, Zubieta 

said he thinks it is important to 
enhance the resiliency people 
already have.

In this way, he said if people 

are responsive even to a pla-
cebo drug, any progress they 
make will be dependent on 
themselves and they may feel 
better using more personal-
ized treatment options like 
therapy.

Rackham student Patrick 

Pruitt, who studies neurosci-
ence and wasn’t involved in the 
study, said he thinks placebo 
response is an exciting topic 
because the theory of it has 
been studied for a long time, 
and the field is now beginning 
to explore practical applica-
tions of that research.

“Now 
we’re 
starting 
to 

understand — even if it’s just 
glimpses — what is going on 
in the brain when someone 
is responding to placebo,” he 
said.

Pruitt also noted the com-

plications associated with pla-
cebos in research and said in 
some situations, such as when 
testing the effects of a new 
drug, researchers actually seek 
to minimize the effect.

“Part of what makes it 

tricky is that there are situa-
tions like drug trials where we 
want the placebo effect to be 
minimized,” he said. “In drug 
trials you want to know if the 
medication is effective — you 
want to look purely at how the 
medication is working and how 
it isn’t working. But then in the 
clinic, you want to maximize 
it.”

Moving 
forward, 
the 

research team said they hoped 
to continue these types of stud-
ies with a larger population.

Pecina said the size of this 

study in particular was a 
limitation, and she hopes to 
expand what the team can do 
in the future.

“This is a small study with 

just 35 patients and the pla-
cebo phase is short — just one 
week,” she said. “We’re looking 
forward to doing studies that 
involve fully randomized tri-
als where we can give patients 
longer placebo treatments.”

Either way, Pruitt said he 

thinks continued research into 
placebo response will open 
new doors in research in the 
coming years.

“Having a better under-

standing of how the placebo 
response works and what type 
of person is going to respond 
to placebo is really going to 
open up our understanding of 
how to account for that in drug 
trials as well as to boost that 
in the clinic, to provide addi-
tional relief for those suffering 
from depression,” he said.

major driving force to see the 
garden come to life, and that 
there have already been several 
courses designed to engage RC 
students with the garden. Mur-
phy said there are plans to offer 
all University students the same 
learning experience in the future.

“The RC is inclusive; I think 

the garden wants to be inclusive 
as well,” she said.

Murphy said the garden will 

soon feature signs to indicate 
which plants are ready to pick 
versus plants that will need addi-
tional growing time. Another

the Back Door Food Pantry.

LSA senior Emma McKenzie 

said she is excited to see a unique 
student-run garden on campus.

She said she hopes more peo-

ple will take an interest in gar-
dening and that they will care 
about where their food is coming 
from.

“That’s better for the Earth 

if we’re transporting less food 
farther distances,” she said. “I’m 
hoping that people start tak-
ing an interest in more locally 
grown food.”

J

unior year of high school, I 
took up a simple but effec-
tive habit. Accompanied 

by my morning 
coffee, I would 
open a collec-
tion of five tabs 
labeled 
“news” 

on my internet 
browser. 
After 

about an hour 
of 
browsing 

Reuters, 
BBC 

and other media 
outlets, I had a 
nice 
introduc-

tion to the day’s 
major stories.

For a while, my newfound practice 

was sustained by the many advan-
tages it offered. I loved finishing my 
friends’ sentences when they enthu-
siastically began, “Did you hear 
about …?” Breaking news headlines 
rarely surprised me; I had already 
read about them hours before. Most 
of all, I learned an incredible amount. 
Each article led to a frenzy of Wiki-
pedia pages as I tried to decipher the 
complicated backstories needed to 
understand them.

But these perks soon reached a 

point of diminishing returns. I grew 
exhausted of my morning routine, 
despite an abundance of exciting 
current events. Did it simply lose 
its novelty over time? No, there was 
something more meaningful at play.

I had learned a valuable lesson: The 

news is overrated.

Let’s overlook, for a moment, the 

irony of this criticism appearing in a 
newspaper. I’m actually in very good 
company. Nearly 150 years before the 
24-hour news cycle, Henry David 
Thoreau insisted: “I am sure that I 
never read any memorable news in 
a newspaper. If we read of one man 

robbed, or murdered, or killed by 
accident, or one house burned, or 
one vessel wrecked … we need never 
read of another.” What was true in an 
age of typewriters is doubly true in 
an age of smartphones, where tech-
nology has ushered in an explosion 
 

of information.

This abundance is not as useful 

as it may seem. We are not unbiased 
readers, rationally swayed by current 
events. We consume the news through 
the lens of our social and political 
beliefs. Because of this, we tend to 
read what we want to read. If some-
thing conflicts with our worldview, we 
are more than happy to blame journal-
istic bias or misreporting. As a result, 
the news is more a source of validation 
than it is knowledge.

Moreover, the news tends to be 

tragic by its very nature. You’ll read a 
story about a new anti-cancer therapy 
one day, but never hear about it again. 
On the contrary, 
tragedies 
bring 

with them dozens 
of 
corroborating 

stories: “Who’s to 
blame? 
Update: 

casualty 
count 

rises. Could this 
happen 
to 
us? 

Casualty 
count 

rises again.” This 
is, no doubt, partly 
because 
major 

networks like to fulfill our morbid 
curiosities. But this curiosity comes 
at a heavy emotional price. Scroll-
ing through such heartbreaking sto-
ries is mentally taxing, and can be 
a huge source of anxiety for college 
students who have enough stress to 
 

begin with.

Finally, it’s important to under-

stand the news in its greater context. 
I again refer to Thoreau, finish-

ing his previous quote: “…If you are 
acquainted with the principle, what 
do you care for a myriad instances 
and applications?” He makes a valu-
able point here. Stories that we hear 
from around the world are merely 
symptoms 
of 
larger 
principles, 

whether they be social, geopolitical, 
etc. They reside on the surface; some-
one who is familiar with the deeper 
issues involved would, in theory, 
learn nothing new from them. Of 
course, the exception is game-chang-
ing events, which threaten to alter 
or even turn our principles on their 
heads. But the proportion of news 
stories that fall under this category 
is miniscule. Once you understand 
the principles, a staggering majority 
of current events become irrelevant.

What, then, is the alternative? My 

morning routine has since changed. 
I tend to read articles from analyti-
cal publications like the Brookings 

Institute 
and 

reputable think 
tanks. I find 
myself 
learn-

ing history in 
an attempt to 
explain 
the 

present. Like-
minded friends 
and 
I 
come 

together to dis-
cuss the news 
— rarely the 

stories themselves, but their global 
contexts. You might find your own 
alternatives. Whatever they are, 
they will be healthier — and more 
effective — than keeping up with the 
news religiously. Open your smart-
phone and you will find a sea of 
headlines. Take care not to drown.

I was disappointed to see several 

of my colleagues, under the pen 
name “Concerned Medical Students 
at the University of Michigan Medi-
cal School,” criticize the invita-
tion of Dr. Tom Price, a Republican 
member of the House of Represen-
tatives and alum of the University 
of Michigan Medical School, in an 
opinion piece published on Sept. 
24, before Price was scheduled to 
speak. Price spoke at the Medical 
School as part of the “Conversations 
with Leadership” series, where 
medical students are able to learn 
from notable Medical School alum-
ni who have become leaders in their 
fields. Because he is a congress-
man, chairman of the House Budget 
Committee and an alum, Price cer-
tainly qualifies. But my colleagues 
apparently disagree, not because of 
any lack in leadership credentials, 
but because they disagree with his 
political views.

In unintended irony, the authors 

largely criticize Price for “(main-
taining) partisan lines,” although 
these lines are, by definition, main-
tained by both political parties. 
They then criticize Price’s votes 
on various issues (unfairly para-
phrased by the authors), which 
were often in line with the over-
whelming majority in the House 
of Representatives. My colleagues 
state they were “not (rebuking) 
Price’s invitation to speak to our 
medical school,” but they question 
whether individuals like Price can 
be promoted as a “model of leader-
ship” given his conservative voting 
record, thereby tacitly implying 
that neither Price nor any other 
conservative should ever be invited 
as a speaker. Furthermore, and per-
haps more dangerously, the authors 
imply 
that 
conservative 
medi-

cal students are not qualified to 
serve as future physician-leaders, 
because conservatism is allegedly 

at odds with medical ethics. 

My colleagues insinuate that 

Price encourages violence against 
women because he voted against 
the deeply flawed Violence Against 
Women Act, that he supports gun 
violence because of his support for 
the Constitutional Concealed Carry 
Reciprocity Act, and that he seeks 
to deprive the poor of irreplaceable 
medical services by voting to trans-
fer the public funding of Planned 
Parenthood to other community 
health centers that provide vital 
services to poor women.

Many 
conservatives 
opposed 

the Violence Against Women Act 
because they believed the bill 
would have the unintended con-
sequence of increasing violence 
against women. A 2007 study from 
the National Bureau of Economic 
Research found that in states that 
implemented 
mandatory 
arrest 

laws, where police are required 
to arrest someone if they receive 
a domestic violence complaint, 
domestic violence homicides actu-
ally increased, possibly because 
abused women were more reluc-
tant to report domestic abuse out of 
the fear that their partners would 
 

be arrested.

The gun bill that my colleagues 

cite, the Constitutional Concealed 
Carry Reciprocity Act, does nothing 
to reduce the number of guns. Rath-
er, it seeks to apply a uniform stan-
dard of enforcement to a patchwork 
of state gun laws. It was proposed in 
response to cases like that of medi-
cal student Meredith Graves, who in 
2011 was arrested in New York City 
for self-reporting her concealed 
weapon (which was legal in her 
home state of Tennessee) to police 
when she learned that guns were 
prohibited at the 9/11 Memorial. At 
the time, she was charged with a 
felony that, if convicted, would have 
ruined her medical career. 

Many who watched the recent 

videos released by the Center for 
Medical 
Progress 
believe 
that 

Planned Parenthood was selling 
fetal tissue for profit (which would 
be a violation of federal law) since 
Planned 
Parenthood 
executives 

were shown apparently haggling 
over prices for fetal organs and jok-
ing about using money to buy luxu-
ry cars. For this reason, the House 
of Representatives voted to transfer 
the public funding of Planned Par-
enthood to other community health 
centers that provide vital services 
to women that Planned Parenthood 
does not provide directly, such 
 

as mammograms.

Certainly, my colleagues have the 

right to express displeasure with 
Price’s politics. The ability to freely 
express and challenge ideas is the 
cornerstone of an open educational 
environment and a free society. But 
to suggest that individuals are unfit 
for leadership, or even to speak and 
be heard, simply because they dis-
agree with one’s extremely parti-
san policy positions is antithetical 
to both free speech and the spirit of 
diversity at the University. A large 
part of being a successful physician 
is having the ability to work with 
patients who may have views and 
experiences very different from our 
own. I applaud the Medical School 
administration for inviting a strong 
conservative voice to our campus, 
allowing students to hear from 
distinguished individuals with dif-
ferent worldviews. I believe that 
interacting with individuals with 
whom we may disagree will make 
us all more thoughtful students and 
citizens. We should promote a cul-
ture where all students are heard 
and encouraged to become Ameri-
ca’s future leaders.

second-year Medical student.

Conservatives should not be excluded

my morning routine,

BENJAMIN LONG | VIEWPOINT

T

he annual Mud Bowl is a time-honored tradition valued by 
the University’s Greek life community. However, this year’s 
tournament is in peril after the Interfraternity Council 

threatened sanctions to any fraternity that participates, as doing so 
would violate a policy that prohibits IFC fraternities from participating 
in events with so-called “rogue fraternities.”

Sigma Alpha Epsilon — the host of the game 

for more than 80 years — is considered to 
be “rogue” after being de-recognized by the 
IFC four years ago and for having its charter 
revoked by its national organization over the 
summer for repeated unruly behavior, such as 
a stabbing at a Halloween party in 2013 and 
numerous other health and safety issues. Given 
this reputation, students should understand 
the risks of participating, but the recent 
decision by the Office of Greek Life and the 
IFC to effectively attempt to end the event is an 
overreach into private student affairs.

Now organizing under the “Flying Eagles,” 

the former members of SAE have planned for 
the charity event to continue, and it should. The 
Mud Bowl is a cornerstone of philanthropic 
events on this campus, having generated over 
$100,000 for C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital over 
the past five years alone. It would be a shame to 
lose that contribution.

It is beyond any doubt that the Mud Bowl 

has been, and always will be, associated with 
the University’s chapter of SAE — a new, avian-
inspired name can’t change that. However, if 
the members of the defunct chapter organize 
the event independently, then the tournament’s 
nominal and official connection to Greek life 
is broken. As long as there is absolutely no 
mention of the event using the name “SAE,” 
then there can be no official connection drawn 
by the Office of Greek Life and the IFC. If 
the participating teams, most likely other 
fraternities, also avoid participating under the 
names of their respective organizations, then 
the event effectively becomes one that isn’t 
part of Greek life at all. That should render 
any sanctions by the IFC ineffective, since it 

obviously has no jurisdiction over non-Greek 
groups. An attempt to overstep this jurisdiction 
to forestall the Mud Bowl is a clear violation of 
students’ individual rights, since the University 
has no control over the philanthropic events of 
private individual parties.

Beginning with the mass Greek life meeting 

in September, there has been a host of publicity 
devoted to the administration’s mission to tame 
troubling trends within Greek community, 
such as high rates of sexual assault and binge 
drinking. Therefore, it is concerning that of all 
things, the Mud Bowl — a relatively harmless, 
extensively planned charity event — would 
lead to the University’s first tangible action 
this semester against Greek life’s behavior.

This isn’t to say, though, the “Flying Eagles” 

can be lax regarding safety. Since this event 
will now be held with no University affiliation 
at all, it is imperative that the “Flying Eagles” 
be as transparent as possible when it comes to 
details and policies to ensure the community’s 
trust. Thus far they have been, having made 
clear that safety measures will be put in place, 
including a risk management policy, insurance 
and hired security.

Furthermore, the group occupying SAE’s 

former chapter house should consider opening 
the event to teams made up of non-Greek 
members. Not only would this potentially 
increase donations, but it would also help unite 
the student body around a football tournament 
that was previously reserved for one-fifth of 
the school. Ultimately, assuming the interest is 
there, it is events like these that can potentially 
start bridging the gap between the Greek and 
non-Greek communities. Efforts like that should 
be endorsed, not threatened by sanctions.

The Mud Bowl must go on

IFC participants should not face punishment

W

hen I arrived at the University 
three years ago, I planned to 
make the most of my college 

experience. Having grown 
up doing music and theatre 
my whole life, I decided 
to continue on this path 
by auditioning for seven 
a capella groups as well 
as the UM Educational 
Theatre Company. I knew 
these groups were competi-
tive, but I reasoned that if I 
auditioned for everything, 
I should at least get one 
callback 
for 
something. 

Instead, all eight groups 
flatly turned me down. As rejection e-mail after 
rejection e-mail flooded my inbox, I began to 
feel a mixture of disappointment, shame and 
inadequacy. To comfort myself, I watched Demi 
Lovato’s “Skyscraper” music video on loop 
while my roommate pretended not to notice the 
tears streaming down my face.

According to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, 

feeling accepted is a key driving force behind 
human behavior. When we experience rejec-
tion, we feel anxious and unhappy because our 
sense of belonging has been jeopardized. Rejec-
tion can be so distressing that we stop putting 
ourselves out there so that we can avoid the 
pain of being repeatedly turned down.

After facing multiple rejections early in my 

college career, I lost all self-confidence and 
retreated back into my shell at a time when I 
should have been putting myself out there the 
most. I fell into a mentality of learned helpless-
ness. I passed up opportunities to apply to pro-
grams that interested me because I assumed I 
would never be chosen. It took until my junior 
year to find the courage to audition for another 
singing group; this time it was the Women’s 
Glee Club. I was completely shocked to receive 
an acceptance e-mail, and I immediately attrib-
uted my admittance to some sort of fluke in the 
audition process. It wasn’t until completing the 
first rehearsal that I realized I had earned a 
spot on my own merits.

As a current executive board member for the 

Women’s Glee Club, I am gaining a new perspec-
tive on rejection by learning about what goes on 
behind the scenes. Part of my job this semester 
was to help run auditions. My heart broke when 
we proofread the rejection e-mail aloud as an 
executive board. I thought back to all the fresh-
men I had met earlier that day, eager to become 
involved on campus and find a sense of commu-
nity. I pictured how their faces would fall as they 

read the e-mail, feeling the same disappointment 
I had felt during my own freshman year.

My biggest takeaway from running auditions 

was realizing how arbitrary the cutoffs were. The 
unfortunate reality is that there are always more 
talented, capable individuals interested in con-
tributing to any organization than there are open 
positions available. Rejection is never meant to 
be a malicious attack on someone’s character; 
it is merely an unavoidable byproduct of most 
application processes, especially at such a large, 
competitive university. Lines must be drawn 
somewhere, and often the only thing separat-
ing those who are rejected versus those who are 
accepted is luck. With this knowledge in mind, 
I am now able to face rejection without taking 
 

it personally.

Another way I learned to remedy the pain of 

rejection is through rejection therapy. A recent 
NPR piece interviewed Jason Comely, who was 
so afraid of rejection that he created a game to 
face his fear. Every day he completed a task that 
he knew would prompt a rejection, such as ask-
ing a stranger for a ride. By making rejection his 
goal, he became desensitized to the unpleas-
antness associated with being denied. He also 
found that he was rejected far less than he 
assumed, and instead began connecting with 
more people. He created playing cards listing 
various challenges, such as “Convince a strang-
er that you know them,” and “Before purchas-
ing something, ask for a discount.” His game 
became so popular that others began using his 
tactics to find dates.

This year, I am starting to practice my own 

form of rejection therapy. Every day I take at 
least one risk, whether it’s talking to a stranger, 
trying a new activity or applying to a new pro-
gram. Rather than feeling ashamed each time 
I am rejected, I am learning to laugh at myself 
and roll with whatever happens. Like Comely, 
I have been pleasantly surprised by how many 
times things have gone my way, allowing me 
to meet more people and take advantage of 
 

new opportunities.

I regret wasting my first three years at the 

University internalizing my rejection letters and 
letting them determine my decisions to apply to 
future programs. Now, as a senior, I realize that 
if I want something badly enough, I shouldn’t 
let one little “no” cause me to give up on myself. 
Instead, I will turn rejection into a laughing mat-
ter and keep pushing forward until I achieve my 
dreams. Go on and try to tear me down; I will be 
rising from the ground. Like a skyscraper.

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

“Quantico” is dumb. I just 

want to establish that fact right 
away. Created by Joshua Safran 
(“Gossip Girl”), 
“Quantico” aims 
to bring soapy, 
melodramatic 
thrills 
to 
the 

FBI 
Academy 

while mixing in 
a chunk of ter-
rorist conspira-
cy. Reminiscent 
of fellow ABC 
series 
“Grey’s 

Anatomy” 
and 

“Scandal,” the show attempts 
to be a sexy thriller, but some-
times veers into the absurd.

It begins with protagonist 

Alex Parrish (Bollywood star 
Priyanka Chopra) awakening 
amid the rubble of a bombed 
Grand Central Station; “Quan-
tico” relies on a flashback struc-
ture similar to “How to Get 
Away with Murder.” Parrish 
remembers her time at the FBI 
Academy after she is informed 
that one of her former fellow 
trainees is a terrorist that per-
petrated the attack.

Some of the show’s twisty rev-

elations make sense — the death 
of Shelby Wyatt’s (Johanna Brad-
dy, “UnReal”) parents during 9/11 
and Simon Asher’s (Tate Elling-
ton, “Straight Outta Compton”) 
origins as a conservative Jew 
who went to Gaza to live among 
the Palestinians provide inven-
tive, yet realistic backstories. 

However, “Quantico” jumps 

off the deep end with twists 
including undercover agents, 
secret 
twins 
and 
Mormon 

mission 
trips 
gone 
terribly 

awry. The cast of trainees is the 
usual network TV ensemble of 
attractive 20- to 30-somethings 
all with deep dark secrets meant 
to leave the audience gasping. 
However, “Quantico” tries so 
hard to draw these gasps with 
constant reveals that the show 
stops 
becoming 
shocking, 

transitions into head-shaking 
and at worst becomes laughable.

Meanwhile, 
Academy 

instructor 
Liam 
O’Connor 

(Josh Hopkins, “Cougar Town”) 
and Academy assistant director 
Miranda Shaw (Aunjanue Ellis, 
“The Help”) are either ignorant 
or assisting their trainees in 
keeping secrets. The pair may 
possess worse judgment than 
Jack Crawford of “Hannibal.”

“Quantico” needs its audi-

ence to believe that the infor-
mation within these flashbacks 
is of critical importance to Alex 
as she tries to make a connec-
tion. But the show does itself a 
disservice in this area, as FBI 
trainees flirt and ogle at one 
another while an indie-pop 
soundtrack plays in the back-
ground. These inclusions kill 
the urgent tone “Quantico” 
establishes early on, and makes 
the flashbacks feel meandering.

However, “Quantico” does work 

on some levels. A few sequences, 
including an interrogation room 
exercise where one recruit really 
doesn’t want something to come 
out, are particularly effective at 
ratcheting up suspense.

Meanwhile, Chopra is a solid 

enough lead. She works best 
at being a confident, assured 
agent-in-training. For example, 
Alex quickly analyzes a fellow 
trainee, Ryan (Jake McLaugh-
lin, “Believe”), utlizing the 
smallest details of his life. 
Chopra conveys the right air of 
assertiveness, creating an ini-
tial allure around her character. 
But, when it comes to disbelief 
and shock, Chopra can sound 
very stilted, like someone feign-
ing surprise at a something they 
already knew.

This becomes a concern when 

the FBI arrests Alex for involve-
ment in the attack on Grand 
Central Station. There’s some-
thing missing from Chopra’s 
delivery as she pleads to know 
what is going on. Hopefully she 
improves as the series goes on, 
the lacking elements of her per-
formance match her strengths.

“Quantico” is in many ways 

an unapologetic guilty plea-
sure series. It’s meant to throw 
its viewers around on a ride 
that will occasionally make no 
sense. As Alex finally escapes at 
the end of the pilot, “Quantico” 
displays the kind of show it is. 
As FBI agents swarm the scene, 
guns drawn, a sole figure in an 
agency hat walks away. No one 
questions, “Why is this agent 
walking away from the scene of 
an emergency?” — they just let 
her go. The figure is Alex as pop 
music soars and her hair bil-
lows back. “Quantico” may be 
a fun ride, but make sure your 
brain is turned off before get-
ting onboard.

Three Daily Arts 
writers cover the 
Rebel Heart Tour

By MELINA GLUSAC, CARLY 

SNIDER and CHRISTIAN 

KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writers

Melina Glusac

The drive from Ann Arbor to 

the Joe Louis Arena lent my fel-
low Arts writers and I the perfect 
amount of time to brush up on all 
things Madonna. She is, after all, a 
pop icon — with a hefty, danceable 
discography to match. The thing 
about icons is: even if you think you 
“forgot” their music, two verses 
into the first song on your refresh-
er playlist you find yourself belting 
“’cause the boy with the cold hard 
cash is ALWAYS MISTAH RI-
IGHT.” And, even though you’re a 
cold hard feminist, you find your-
self believing it for a split second. 
Madonna just has that effect.

So by the time we rolled up to 

the venue, the Rebel Heart Tour 
had just begun its explosion of col-
ors, dancers and sexy acrobats. We 
took our seats as the Queen of Pop 
opened up with “Iconic,” perhaps 
the trappiest of tunes off her latest 
release. Splices of Chance the Rap-
per and Mike Tyson (yes, Mike 
Tyson) video clips filled the big 
screen as she was lowered from a 
giant cage, only to break out at the 
end — a beautiful metaphor and 
visual 
shindig, 
simultaneously. 

The concert continued on in these 
phases of evolution: set chang-
es, dress changes and aesthetic 
re-envisioning. Madge took her 
audience on a consistently enter-
taining journey of Art Deco glam 
(“Music”), Detroit gas station chic 
(“Body Shop”), and rainy, film noir 
desperation (“HeartBreakCity”).

But despite the performances’ 

technical 
prowess 
and 
the 

surprising athleticism of this ever-
changing, forward-thinking diva, 
the most inventive aspects of the 
whole night were the throwbacks. 
Every ’80s staple she performed 
(“True 
Blue,” 
“Material 
Girl,” 

“Holiday,” “La Isla Bonita,” etc.) 
was executed in an unconventional 
way 
— 
radically 
different 

instrumentation, tempo changes 
and isolated vocals. The night’s 
shining, ecstatic moment was a Día 
De Los Muertos-themed interlude 
of “Dress You Up,” another techno 
classic 
rebooted 
and 
stripped 

down to intricate Mexican acoustic 
guitars, pounding bongos and 
congas, and bursts of pink and 
green and red flowers. Only she 
could get away with this: a complete 
180 and a surprised yet entranced 
— always entranced — audience to 
boot. Bitch, she’s Madonna.

Carly Snider

Madonna: performer, cultural 

icon, innovator. To be able to see an 
artist that has been perfecting her 
craft for over three decades was, 
to put it lightly, astounding. The 

impact of her music on her fans 
was obvious as the pop queen drew 
a widely mixed crowd – parents 
and children, women clad in the 
star’s signature leather and lace, 
middle-aged men rocking bedaz-
zled Madonna t-shirts, and, like 
myself and my fellow arts writers, 
a few young souls looking to bask 
in musical greatness. Spanning 
two hours and multiple costume 
changes, Madonna’s veteran status 
was obvious in her performance.

It is only fitting that the opener 

was as “Iconic” as its singer. Mov-
ing on to “Bitch I’m Madonna,” the 
set list was kept fairly recent, but 
did touch upon some of her biggest 
throwback hits – “Like A Virgin,” 
“Material Girl” and “Holiday.” Her 
performance style was nothing if 
not theatrical, featuring circus-
esque backup dancers, an inclined 
portion of the stage and a large cat-
walk shaped like a cross, ending in 
a heart.

One of my only qualms with the 

overall experience would be the 
lack of impression left by the open-
ing act – DJ Kaytranada – who 
played good songs from his booth, 
but did little to interact with the 
crowd. Don’t get me wrong, some-
one like Madonna really doesn’t 
need a banging opener, but it 
would have been nice. But, back to 
what’s important.

Madonna’s performance fur-

ther proved her already renowned 
stamina, 
multi-faceted 
perfor-

mance style and creativity as an 
artist. She incorporated Día De 
Los Muertos, flags from around 
the world, biblical references all 
while putting her signature stamp 
on things. Even as someone who 
just recently got into the music of 
the mega-star, her cultural-per-
manence and iconic status made 
it seem as if I had been a super 
fan for years. And I plan to be for 
many more.

Christian Kennedy

My journey to the Rebel Heart 

Tour was an odd one. I reviewed 
Rebel Heart when it was first 
released in March. Now, the 
majority of songs I love I had shit 
on. Therefore, I didn’t buy tickets 
when they went on sale as I nor-
mally would, but eventually I did 
and then slowly, over months, I 
listened to more Madonna, and 
finally it settled in about the week 
before that I was seeing Madonna. 
Like, that’s a big deal. Her career 
began far before my birth year. 
She has influenced the culture 
I’ve lived in my entire life. What I 
learned is that going to a Madonna 
show is something to always write 
home about.

The production was on-par, 

if not above, every other pop-
arena spectacle touring around 
the world today. Her moves were 
on point and her vocals were far 
beyond what she’s given credit for 
nowadays. The juxtaposition of 
new Rebel Heart tracks with clas-
sics like “Material Girl” or “Who’s 
That Girl” only proves the fact that 
Madonna can (and still is) slaying 

the pop game.

Moreover, new age Madonna 

isn’t quite the same, but that’s 
good. Instead of focusing on shock 
or politics as she has in the past, 
the Rebel Heart Tour focused sole-
ly on the music and its songstress. 
The progression from the self-
reflective, yet egocentric opener 
“Iconic” to the altruistic “Holiday” 
closer goes to show all of Madon-
na’s facets.

Ultimately 
though, 
“Rebel 

Heart,” the title track off Madon-
na’s thirteenth album, was what 
the night was about. The night was 
about looking back on accomplish-
ments and hardships and coming 
out stronger than ever — knowing 
yourself more than ever.

A history of the pop 

music canon

T

he Beatles and The 
Rolling Stones took the 
proto-rock ‘n’ roll of 

Chuck Berry and Little Richard 
and made it a global phenom-
enon. Then 
The Who 
and Pink 
Floyd and 
Springsteen 
all took their 
enormous 
ambition and 
played clas-
sic records 
to huge sta-
diums. Then 
punk showed up to cut every-
one back down to size. Then 
Guns ‘n’ Roses and hair metal 
got huge. Then Nirvana sup-
planted that overindulgence. 
And now we’re here.

That was my story of popular 

music for a long time. How did I 
get there?

***

I was reading “A Home at the 

End of the World” by Michael 
Cunningham over the summer, 
and came across a great scene 
where the characters dance to 
Laura Nyro, a singer-songwriter 
I had never heard of. When I 
looked her up, I half-expected 
her to be fictional, but no, Nyro 
was a quite successful songwrit-
er in the ’60s and ’70s — granted, 
a lot of her songs were written 
for other artists, but she still has 
several well-regarded albums of 
her own.

I listened to Nyro and 

instantly fell in love. Her 
voice was soulful, her baroque 
arrangements busy and upbeat. 
She’d written “Wedding Bell 
Blues,” done a brilliant cov-
ers record of R&B songs with 
LaBelle and released classic 
albums like Eli and the Thir-
teenth Confession and New York 
Tendaberry that were simulta-
neously heavy with meaning 
and light with beauty. I was 
elated that I’d discovered Nyro, 
but honestly, I was pissed that 
it had taken me so long.

When I was growing up, I 

somehow got the “classic rock” 
education. I don’t know where 
exactly it started — my parents 
weren’t huge into the genre or 
anything — but for a long time 
The Who was my favorite band, 
and I listened to Guns ‘n’ Roses 
unironically, and I thought 
Pink Floyd’s The Wall was the 
greatest album of all time. I 
got my testosterone-drenched 
history of popular music from 
Rock Docs and Greatest Hits 
album liner notes, and those 
sources really didn’t leave any 
room for geniuses like Joni 
Mitchell or Carole King or 
Laura Nyro.

My point is, if you ask anyone 

to give you a history of popu-
lar music from the ’50s or ’60s 
onward, the answers you get will 
vary wildly based on age, race, 
gender and where the respon-
dent grew up, and that means 
the way we learn about music is 

subject to some crazy biases.

***

Charley Patton and Robert 

Johnson created the Blues. 
Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters 
carried on the tradition. Dylan 
picked it up in the ’60s. Joni 
made a perfect break-up album 
while Nick Drake crafted unap-
preciated beauty. Big Star made 
some transcendent melancholy 
music in the ’70s, and Bowie 
made some great records, too. 
Underground punk and new 
wave rode through the ’80s, 
giving way to mainstream alter-
native rock like U2, R.E.M. or 
Radiohead. Now we have the 
The National, Brand New and 
Arcade Fire.

***

A lot of indie kids (or hipsters, 

whatever you want to call them) 
will cite Big Star as one of the 
greatest bands of all time. Funny 
thing is, absolutely nobody in the 
’70s (when the band was actually 
around) would have even known 
who they were. Big Star toiled 
in obscurity for just a few years 
before falling apart.

But somewhere along the 

line, Big Star got rediscovered 
— bands like R.E.M. named 
them as influences, their 
records got reissued and critics 
kept waving a flag for the band. 
Number 1 Record and Radio City 
are both in Rolling Stone’s “Top 
500 Albums of All Time” list, 
and they’re now cult classics 
thanks to their brilliant songs 
and mythic aura. Those albums 
have sad, longing feelings 
set to absolutely gorgeous 
melodies. Especially if you’re in 
a certain late-night existential 
melancholy, those songs paint 
the perfect portrait of a band 
who always deserved more 
than it got.

Frankly, I love Big Star, and 

I’m so obnoxious about that 
fact I could probably talk about 
them forever. But I listen to 
other bands with similar sounds 
from the same era — like The 
Raspberries or Badfinger — and 
I honestly wonder how Big Star 
ended up in our indie rock canon 
but not those other bands. The 
answer, I think, is simply that 
those other bands were famous, 
while Big Star had no commer-
cial success whatsoever.

***

After Elvis, you had Motown 

and the girl groups. They gave 
way to bands like ABBA, Fleet-
wood Mac and The Bee Gees. 
After Disco, Michael, Prince 
and Madonna dominated the 
charts while hip hop started 
to gain its footing. The ’90s 
were a decade of Biggie, 2Pac, 
Dre and Jay, but as the decade 
closed out and we entered the 
new millennium you’d be hear-
ing Britney, Beyoncé, Justin, 
The Black Eyed Peas and The 
Killers on the radio. Lately, it’s 
Gaga, Kanye or Maroon 5, and 
now it’s Fetty Wap.

***

Most kids born in the mid-to-

late ’90s remember Janet Jack-
son for one incident — the event 
that birthed the phrase “ward-
robe malfunction” in the popular 
lexicon. What I didn’t even real-
ize until this year was that she 
has had ten number-one hits and 
released some of the best-selling 
albums of all time.

Sometime in the last 10 years, 

Janet Jackson got completely 
written out of The Canon. None 
of her songs seem to qualify as 
“throwback jams;” her career 
gets overshadowed by peers like 
Madonna or Whitney Houston, 
and her entire legacy, for at least 
some generations, has been 
reduced to one moment.

Jackson has a “comeback” 

album out now called Unbreak-
able. (I put comeback in quotes 
just because even with her 
recent lack of popularity, Jack-
son is still a remarkably wealthy, 
successful artist.) Buoyed by 
the strong, understated single 
“No Sleeep” she released this 
summer (which was a fantastic 
minimalist jam as long as you 
didn’t listen to the J. Cole ver-
sion), I went back through Jack-
son’s back catalog and stumbled 
upon some huge hits that I had 
somehow never heard. There’s 
classic dance-pop like “If” and 
‘Control” as well as rainy-night 
R&B slow jams like “Any Time, 
Any Place” (which I actually did 
know from its usage in Kend-
rick Lamar’s “Poetic Justice”). 
After even just the most cursory 
look through her hit singles, my 
perception of Jackson had com-
pletely changed.

I like Unbreakable, and I 

would really love it if some of 
its singles could break through 
and reach mainstream radio 
just to give Millennials some-
thing else to associate with 
Jackson’s name besides the 
Super Bowl incident. To some, 
it might not seem like a huge 
deal which artists get recog-
nized by future generations. 
However, I keep thinking about 
how we write and rewrite our 
own histories, and the more I 
think about it, the more impor-
tant it seems that this genera-
tion doesn’t forget about our 
greatest artists just because 
of random chance or biases. 
What if, in 20 years, all the kids 
think Lil B was better than 
Kanye West? Or what if Azealia 
Banks overshadows Beyoncé? 
That wouldn’t just be weird; 
it would be patently unfair to 
artists and listeners. I don’t 
know how exactly we go about 
writing our own Canon for the 
music of our lifetime, but when 
we do, I just want to make sure 
that the Laura Nyros and Janet 
Jacksons of the 2000s don’t 
slip through the cracks and get 
unheard by people who might 
need them.

‘Sex’ disappointing

TV REVIEW

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

Since its second season, “Mas-

ters of Sex” has produced great 
individual moments and episodes 
that don’t hold 
up 
as 
well 

when viewed 
as parts of a 
greater whole. 
The third sea-
son 
finale, 

titled 
“Full 

Ten 
Count,” 

follows 
that 

same pattern. 
Several 
con-

flicts come to 
a head that the 
whole 
show 

has been building to, yet so much 
of the episode is littered with 
the remains of story threads that 
have been lackluster at best.

Still, Bill and Virginia’s role 

reversal has been one intriguing 
thread to follow through the sea-
son, and it’s pleasant seeing Bill 
(Michael Sheen, “Frost/Nixon”) 
acting a more kind, sympathetic 
and honest than his cold, detached 
role in previous seasons. When 
Bill defiantly tells Virginia (Lizzy 
Caplan, “Mean Girls”) that he 
loves her, and later takes a cab to 
the airport to beg with her to come 
back with him, he’s worthy of 
being the romantic lead the show 
always asked him to be. It’s easy 
to become jaded about the cliff-
hanger when Bill stands sadly out-
side, his professional and personal 
future with Virginia uncertain, 
but the show invests the audi-
ence with empathy for him. That 
often wasn’t possible earlier on. 
This season has mostly revolved 
around a love triangle between 
sex researcher Bill Masters, his 
partner Virginia Johnson and fra-
grance industry businessman, Dan 
Logan (Josh Charles, “The Good 
Wife”). Last week’s episode served 
to finally make Logan a real char-
acter with flaws and complexities 
of his own, and “Full Ten Count” 
shows him impressively commit-
ting to Virginia, leaving his wife 
and proposing to Virginia. It’s nice 
to see Virginia actually taking a 
stand against Bill and choosing 
Logan instead of constantly waf-
fling between the two men. Still, 
it’s hard not to sigh at the delay of 
the inevitable resolution when Bill 
and Virginia will end up together. 
Even if there was any dramatic 
tension left in the love triangle, 
history tells us Masters and John-
son get married. By now, new love 
interests and contrivances feel like 
unnecessary wheel-spinning.

Aside from the love triangle 

business, most of the finale 
deals 
with 
cleaning 
up 
the 

various threads left hanging. Bill 

finds himself in jail because a 
participant in his sex study, Nora 
(Emily Kinney, “The Walking 
Dead”), is a religious mole bent 
on framing him for prostitution 
and taking down the study. He’s 
also in trouble because his son, 
Johnny (Jaeden Lieberher, “St. 
Vincent”), made a comment about 
a boy at school that leads the police 
to accuse Bill of molestation. And 
in one scene designed to tie up 
a lingering loose end, Bill’s wife 
Libby (Caitlin Fitzgerald, “Mutual 
Friends”) finds out her lover Paul 
(Ben Koldyke, “Mr. Robinson”) is 
gone for good.

All of these subplots have 

sucked up time that could have 
been better spent taking Bill 
and Virginia’s sex study to the 
next level, and none could have 
been predicted from the season 
premiere, an episode generally 
expected to set up the structure 
and overall arcs of the season. 
The show has introduced too 
many narrative cul-de-sacs to 
actually resolve the overarching 
story. The first few episodes 
promised a deep look into Bill and 
Virginia’s twisted relationships 
with their children, but the roles 
of Virginia’s kids, Tessa (Isabelle 
Fuhrman, “Orphan”) and Henry 
(Noah 
Robbins, 
“Aftermath”), 

proved superfluous. Tessa was 
a mustache-twirling antagonist 
who the story repeatedly failed 
to invest viewers in, and Henry 
signed up for the Army only to 
disappear completely from the 
story. As little as these characters 
ultimately 
mattered, 
though, 

it’d still make sense to conclude 
the season with some closure in 
regards to their relationship with 
their mother. Both characters 
are completely missing from the 
finale. Johnny’s lack of meaningful 
interaction with his father is 
even more frustrating, as Bill’s 
projection of his father’s coldness 
onto Johnny made a potentially 

fascinating story. Much like the 
love triangle, though, this story 
is left unresolved. Maybe it’ll be 
resolved next premiere, or maybe 
it’ll be dragged out for years.

Still, just like any other episode 

of “Masters of Sex,” there are 
enough impactful moments to 
distract from the glaring flaws. 
Dr. Barton Scully (Beau Bridges, 
“The Millers”) finally becomes 
comfortable showing affection 
for another man in public. 
Most prominent, though, is a 
final moment of closure for Bill 
and his wife. Bill and Libby’s 
relationship has been fairly 
one-note for most of the show, 
but this season has added the 
interesting wrinkle that Libby 
is aware of Bill’s affair and 
has accepted it. Finally, in the 
finale, Bill and Libby have the 
confrontation the whole show 
has built toward. After three 
seasons of deception, denial 
and dysfunction, Bill admits to 
the affair. Fitzgerald’s reaction 
is powerful as she laughs at the 
idea that she still wouldn’t have 
known, then hysterically breaks 
down as Bill abruptly suggests 
they separate. “It would be the 
one honest thing we do in years,” 
Bill says softly. After years of lies 
and quiet sacrifice, finally the 
unspoken becomes spoken. It’s a 
moment of pure catharsis.

“Masters of Sex” becomes 

more of an issue each year, as all 
notions of structure are thrown 
out in favor of uninteresting 
stories that distract from the 
sex study that made the show 
so compelling in its first season. 
It’s up in the air whether next 
season will be able to reclaim 
the scientific magic and aching 
human drama of the first, but if 
the show maintains its ability 
to create singular moments of 
beauty despite recurring story 
problems, it’ll always be worth 
watching.

ALBUM REVIEW

‘Unbreakable’ a dull 
comeback for Janet

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Seven years after Feedback, 

Janet Jackson has returned to the 
pop music landscape with her 11th 
studio album, 
Unbreakable. 
The record’s 
title works on 
many levels: 
it may refer 
to Jackson’s 
unbreakable 
optimism, 
which 
is 

pervasive 
throughout the LP; it may refer 
to her ability to overcome life’s 
hardships 
(the 
death 
of 
her 

brother, Michael, a Super Bowl 
nip-slip and the termination of a 
seven-year relationship); or it may 
refer to the unbreakable mold of 
underdeveloped, 
overproduced 

pop R&B tracks that, together, form 
the entirety of her new album.

Moments on Unbreakable fall 

into a few categories: the repetitive, 
the cliché and the wandering. That 
may not sound too blundering; 
however, the repetitive moments 
are not catchy, the clichés don’t 
recognize themselves as such and 
the wandering fails to discover 
anything terribly stimulating.

“BURNITUP!” has potential 

with the heavy bass and a Missy 
Elliott feature, but the repeated 
phrases “turn it up” and “burn it 
up” don’t invite any participation 
beyond some slight head nodding 
(maybe). Even more disappointing 
is the degree to which Missy 
Elliott’s verse is boring. Elliott, 
as shown by her Super Bowl 
appearance, might be ready for 
a comeback, but if this is any 
indicator of it’s content, she might 
be best left in her Greatest Hits era.

Opener “Unbreakable” offers 

an acceptable beat, but amid 
the many layers of vocal tracks 
and the unimaginative chorus, 
the song’s potential is lost. In 
the same vein, every lyric on 
“Shoulda Known Better” has 
been heard on another track. 
At its best moment, though, the 
instrumental build is just enticing 
enough to hear it out. “Broken 
Hearts Heal” can be described in 
the exact same fashion — minus 
the a capitivating production.

However, the metaphor behind 

“Well 
Traveled” 
is 
original. 

Jackson has come a long way, and 
she’s still going, but this song still 
won’t go anywhere. She croons 
about traveling as she sings in 
circles. Individually, the lyrics are 
OK, but compiled together nothing 

greater is revealed. In “Black 
Eagle,” another wanderer begins 
with another metaphor. “Let me 
tell you about the black eagle,” she 
says. And after that initial intro, 
we don’t hear a damn thing about 
that eagle again.

While the album lacks in the 

majority of areas, it does have 
a couple moments of cohesive, 
coherent content. “2 B Loved” has 
the retro/modern feel that has 
been 
bombarding 
pop-culture 

recently (i.e. “Uptown Funk” 
by Mark Ronson, “Classic” by 
MKTO etc. etc.). And despite the 
fact that Kendrick Lamar filled 
the “We gon’ be alright” quota, 
“Gon’ B Alright” by Jackson has 
the heart and enthusiasm behind 
her delivery to make it one of the 
album’s stand-outs.

From the moment track one 

ends, it’s easy to realize that this 
is an album for Jackson’s longtime 
fans as she says “I’m glad you’re 
still here / I dedicate myself to 
you / I hope you enjoy.” I am not 
one of these fans (obviously), 
but their dedication to Jackson 
and 
Jackson’s 
dedication 
to 

them, as well as to her artistry, 
is respectable at the very least. 
“Unbreakable” might not break 
out of the mold, but at least it’s the 
mold Jackson created herself.

My bubbie and sports

C

HERRY HILL, N.J. 
— Two Michigan 
shutouts bookended my 

grandmother’s life. Sylvia Cohen 
was born on 
Oct. 13, 1927, 
two days 
before Elton 
Wieman’s 
Wolverines 
shut out 
Wisconsin. 
She passed 
away Friday 
at the age of 
87, six days 
after the 
Wolverines defeated Brigham 
Young, 31-0.

She was never the biggest 

sports fan, a fact she readily 
admitted. But of all the people 
in the world, my grandmother 
(I call her Bubbie) might be 
the biggest reason I’m in the 
position to write this column 
every other week.

Bubbie could tell a story 

like nobody else. She could 
wax poetic for hours about 
being a child during the Great 
Depression, growing up in 
Brooklyn or summers in the 
Catskill Mountains. Sometimes, 
her stories even involved sports 
— she spent her entire life 
surrounded by sports lunatics.

In Brooklyn, everyone was 

crazy about the Dodgers before 
they moved to Los Angeles in 
1958. Bubbie always told me 
about how people called them 
“The Bums” because the players 
made little money. Times were 
different back then, she’d say.

Bubbie never attended a game 

at Ebbets Field, though, until 
after she met my grandfather. 
They went on a date to a game 
between the Dodgers and 
the Philadelphia Phillies, my 
grandfather’s favorite team. The 
date worked out well, I guess. 
They were married for 66 years.

My grandfather is an 

enormous sports fan, the most 

knowledgeable one I know. 
He remembers the first game 
he ever went to, when the 
Chicago White Sox defeated 
the Philadelphia Athletics, 5-3, 
at Shibe Park in Philadelphia 
on May 26, 1935. Jimmy Dykes, 
the White Sox third baseman, 
hit two home runs that day. My 
grandfather remembers the 
details of the game 80 years 
later.

He has held Eagles and Flyers 

season tickets for more than 40 
years, and he taught his sons 
— my father and my uncle — to 
love the same teams he did. That 
much was evident from their 
dinner conversations.

Bubbie cooked her family 

dinner nearly every night when 
my dad was growing up. She 
put the food on the table, and 
the conversation immediately 

turned to sports.

My dad, my uncle and my 

grandfather then went on and 
on about the latest happenings 
in Philadelphia sports. When 
they weren’t talking about 
Philadelphia sports, my uncle 
jokes, they talked about fellow 
Jews who played sports. Bubbie 
sat and listened through it all. 
Sports, however little she was 
interested, were a constant in 
her life.

One week, during what my 

dad believes was 1978, his cousin 
came to visit the family. The son 
of a Holocaust survivor from 
Germany, he had little interest 
in sports.

After a week filled with 

talking about baseball, listening 
to baseball on the radio and 
attending baseball games with 
Bubbie’s family, he was hooked. 

He spent all of his time in the 
aftermath of the visit walking 
around his home with a radio 
to his ear listening to baseball 
games.

Bubbie’s sister called her 

after the visit with one question: 
“What did you do to my son?”

When it came to the sports 

talk, my Bubbie always 
referenced a quote from her 
own mother, who came to live in 
the United States from Europe. 
After spending time with 
Bubbie’s family, she once said, “I 
know they’re speaking English, 
but I have no idea what they’re 
saying.”

Most of the time, neither 

did Bubbie. My dad and my 
grandfather have had a fantasy 
football team for 26 years, and 
every year from when I was 
three years old until I left for 

Ann Arbor, my Bubbie and I 
would come to the draft as 
guests. When I was young, 
we ate pizza together and 
talked while my dad and my 
grandfather made their picks. 
But as I got older and became 
more involved in the team, she 
always smiled and reminded me 
that she was there, “just in case 
we needed help.”

Sometimes, shockingly, we 

took caring about sports too 
far. Bubbie hosted many family 
dinners in my lifetime that 
devolved into shouting matches 
about the Eagles, Donovan 
McNabb and whether making it 
to the NFC Championship Game 
every year but never winning 
the goddamn Super Bowl was 
enough. She never batted an eye. 
I don’t know how she put up 
with it all.

Because games were always 

on in the house, Bubbie did 
know enough to pick a few 
favorite players. She loved the 
scrappy bad boys, the ones 
who gave it their all on the 
field but were prone to trouble 
off of it. She became a fan of 
Allen Iverson and Pete Rose in 
particular, two players who, 
to say the least, were quite 
interesting. She always said she 
found them exciting to watch.

It wasn’t until the last few 

years that Bubbie became a 
regular viewer of sports. She 
started to tune into the Phillies, 
putting down the books she 
loved to read to watch the 
games with my grandfather. 
Chase Utley became her favorite 
player, to the point that she 
was adamant the Phillies never 
should have traded him this 
summer. No matter how hard 
I tried to convince her that the 
Phillies needed to get younger, 
she would have none of it.

Luckily for me, Bubbie was 

the only Jewish grandmother in 
the world who was just as proud 
of her grandson who wanted to 
be a sports writer as she would 
have been had he wanted to be a 
doctor or a lawyer.

The day before she died, my 

sister — a freshman at Michigan 
— and I flew home from Ann 
Arbor. We went to the hospital 
to visit Bubbie one last time. In 
a way, it was a great day, time to 
spend a few last moments with 
someone we loved.

We told her about our lives at 

school and how everything was 
going. My sister showed Bubbie 
pictures of her friends hanging 
out in the Big House, all of them 
grinning and decked out in 
Michigan gear from head to toe.

It was the last time I saw 

Bubbie smile.

Hurricane 
Harbaugh

C

OLLEGE PARK — The 
official blew his whistle, 
and the Maryland play-

ers hurried indoors, heads low 
and spirits 
even lower.

Fans soon 

followed 
suit, leaving 
their snacks, 
ponchos and 
confidence 
behind to 
join the 
long lines 
of others 
desperate to 
evacuate the scene.

While they waited, questions 

of leadership turned to anger — 
hope had turned to despair.

Remaining in the wake were 

thousands of Michigan fans 
who clouded Byrd Stadium 
with maize and blue and joy. 
Below them were the players, 
still somewhat shocked at the 
damage they caused and can 
cause at their next stop.

And at the center of it all 

stood the eye of a storm that 
has an entire nation talking — 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh.

On a day when Hurricane 

Joaquin mercifully changed 
course and steered clear of 
Maryland, Harbaugh and his 
team made sure to leave behind 
a lasting impact of their own.

The destruction of the 

Terrapins was far from 
surprising: The Wolverines have 
outscored their opponents by 
a combined 122-14 in their last 
four games and outgained them 
by a staggering 1,023 yards in 
that span. But like all hurricanes, 
Hurricane Harbaugh is as 
unstoppable as it is predictable.

“We knew we had a challenge 

ahead of ourselves,” said 
Maryland running back Wes 
Brown. “They didn’t do anything 
special that we didn’t see on 
film. It was on us, we weren’t 
executing.”

Despite the strong forecasts, 

the storm was slow to start. 
In a sloppy but scoreless first 
quarter, it looked like 16-point 
underdog Maryland had taken 
the necessary precautions to 
keep everyone safe.

But it wasn’t enough, as a sea 

of white uniforms and winged 
helmets rose from the sideline 
and drowned out any hopes of an 
upset. The Wolverines suffocated 
the Terrapins, holding them to 35 
yards on 46 plays after their first 
two possessions.

By the time the third quarter 

rolled around, and backup 
quarterback Daxx Garman 
was sacked with all six of his 
blockers laying on the ground 
in front of him, it was too late to 
escape Harbaugh’s wrath — his 
team was too fast, too powerful 
and no longer on the horizon.

Yes, Hurricane Harbaugh is 

still picking up steam, and can 
become even more powerful. 
Fifth-year senior quarterback 
Jake Rudock continues to turn 
the ball over and miss big plays 
on offense, half a dozen players 
were limited in practice with 
injuries and, though the defense 
has allowed just 1.8 yards per 
play and 205 total yards in its 
last two games, slow starts on 
defense could doom Michigan in 
its upcoming two games against 
No. 17 Northwestern and No. 2 
Michigan State.

But the fact remains: Hurricane 

Harbaugh gathers momentum 
and strength with every team it 
obliterates, and looks as strong 
as any storm to originate in Ann 
Arbor has in years.

Experts will continue to 

debate just how far this team can 
go, what category it belongs in 
and how teams match up.

But on Saturday, it was 

stunningly clear: the damage left 
behind by Hurricane Harbaugh 
is not something to take lightly.

Defense earns 
second shutout

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

COLLEGE PARK — Michigan 

football coach Jim Harbaugh had 
to catch himself before he praised 
his defense too highly.

“A very high level,” Harbaugh 

said of his defense’s play on 
Saturday. “I reserve ‘highest.’ I 
think we can do better. … I think 
there’s still a higher level.”

For the second week in a row, 

the Wolverines’ defense was 
nearly impenetrable in a 28-0 
win over Maryland. Michigan 
allowed just 105 total yards, the 
same number it did in a 31-0 
pounding of then-No. 22 BYU last 
week.

The Wolverines have now put 

together back-to-back shutouts 
for the first time since 2000, 
when Michigan blanked Indiana 
and Michigan State.

Saturday was a performance 

worthy 
of 
that 
distinction. 

Maryland 
quarterback 
C.J. 

Rowe hardly had time to throw, 
completing just eight of 27 
passes on the day. He threw 
three interceptions before being 
pulled, bringing his season total 
to 12 through five games, and he 
was sacked four times behind an 
offensive line that was simply no 
match for the Wolverines.

Redshirt defensive tackle Matt 

Godin had 1.5 sacks, and redshirt 
sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 

Maurice Hurst added two tackles 
for loss, one of which was a sack, 
in an effort that was nothing 
short of dominant.

On one play near the end of 

the third quarter, redshirt junior 
defensive 
end 
Willie 
Henry 

plowed 
through 
his 
blocker 

and had a free shot at Rowe’s 
replacement, 
Daxx 
Garman. 

Henry outstretched his arms and 
wrapped up Garman, throwing 
him to the turf with ferocity. 
And it wasn’t just Henry who 
crushed his man on the play. 
Every member of the Terrapins’ 
offensive line ended up on the 
ground while Henry devoured 

their quarterback.

Maryland ended the game 

with 29 yards rushing, largely 
in part to the minus-23 yards its 
quarterbacks accumulated on the 
ground. But after the game, the 
Wolverines weren’t ready to pat 
themselves on the back.

“We had a couple plays where 

they got first downs,” Hurst said. 
“We’ve gotta look at that and 
correct it. They shouldn’t have 
anything.”

They 
nearly 
didn’t. 
The 

Terrapins earned just seven first 
downs the entire game, and they 
were a dreadful 1-for-18 on third 
down.

Meanwhile, every facet of the 

Michigan defense clicked. The 
pass defense, which entered the 
game allowing the fifth-fewest 
yards per game in the country at 
121.8, outdid itself again, allowing 
just 76.

Even 
fifth-year 
senior 

linebacker 
Desmond 
Morgan 

came away with an interception, 
adding two pass breakups to a 
dominant effort.

And while the big plays were 

impressive, there was still an 
aspect of the defense Harbaugh 
was more impressed with.

“The key to the game (was) 

when the offense made mistakes, 
our 
defense 
did 
not 
allow 

Maryland to capitalize on them,” 
Harbaugh said. “That was the 
difference.”

Michigan has now allowed just 

seven points in its last 15 quarters, 
dating back to its 28-0 win over 
Oregon State on Sept. 12. With 
Northwestern’s 
stout 
defense 

coming to Ann Arbor next week, 
fans could be in for some of the 
lowest-scoring football in recent 
memory.

If Harbaugh has anything to 

say about it, more history could 
be made.

“Now I want to know what’s 

three, when’s (the last time a 
Michigan team pitched three 
consecutive shutouts?)” Harbaugh 
wondered after the game. “I’ll 
have to look that one up.”

Wolverines sweep 
weekend matchups

By ORION SANG

For the Daily

Led 
by 
senior 
forward 

Shannon 
Scavelli’s 
game-

winning goal, the Michigan field 
hockey 
team 
pulled out a 
2-1 victory 
against 
Indiana 
on Sunday afternoon. The close 
win capped off a weekend that 
also included a 5-0 win against 
Pacific.

The Wolverines (3-1 Big Ten, 

9-3 overall) were locked in a 
tight battle throughout Sunday’s 
game against the Hoosiers (2-1, 
6-5).

“Indiana is a good team,” 

said Michigan coach Marcia 
Pankratz. “We knew they were 
going to come in here really fired 
up.”

The 
Wolverines 
were 
in 

danger of falling behind early 
if not for a save on an Indiana 
corner by sophomore goalie Sam 
Swenson, who only allowed one 
goal over two 
games 
this 

weekend.

But 
while 

Swenson 
was 
reliable 

in 
goal, 

Michigan 
struggled 
to 
get 
its 

offense going, 
especially on 
corners; they were 0-for-8 on 
such opportunities.

Eventually, the Wolverines 

got on the board when fifth-
year senior back Mackenzie 
Ellis buried a penalty stroke 
with 10 minutes left in the first 
half.

Michigan 
took 
its 
one-

goal lead into halftime but 
lost it less than two minutes 
into the second half when the 
Hoosiers converted a penalty 
corner. Indiana’s Kate Barber 
slapped a shot past Swenson’s 
outstretched stick, and the game 

was tied once again.

Both teams missed multiple 

opportunities to take a 2-1 
advantage 
before 
Scavelli 

notched 
the 
game-winning 

goal with 13 minutes left. It 
was Scavelli’s sixth goal of 
the season, placing her well 
on track to pass her career-
best total of seven from last 
year. Scavelli will have at least 
seven more games to notch her 
seventh goal.

“It feels good,” Scavelli said. 

“No matter who scores, as 
long as we win, that’s the most 
important thing.”

The Hoosiers pulled their 

goalie 
soon 
after 
Scavelli’s 

goal but were unable to find 
an equalizer. The hard-fought 
victory was crucial for the 
Wolverines, who jumped from 
fourth to third in the Big Ten 
standings.

“We pulled out an important 

win,” Pankratz said. “I was 
proud of the team for that.”

The Wolverines were sharper 

against 
Pacific 
two 
nights 

earlier, as five different players 

scored to lead 
Michigan to a 
5-0 
triumph. 

It 
was 
the 

most goals the 
Wolverines 
have 
scored 

this 
season, 

and 
they 

netted 
four 

in the second 
half alone.

Swenson posted her fourth 

shutout of the season, and the 
defense held the Tigers to just 
four shots.

With 
the 
two 
victories, 

Michigan has now won nine 
of its last 10 games, and looks 
to 
continue 
its 
momentum 

into next week’s matchup with 
Iowa.

“We need to continue to 

work to get better on goal 
scoring, transferring the ball 
and prepare for Iowa’s tactics,” 
Pankratz said. “It’ll be a good 
week of preparation for us.”

‘M’ rallies past 
Michigan State

Wolverines recover 
after dropping first 

two sets

By ETHAN WOLFE

For the Daily

With state pride on the line, 

the sold-out crowd at Cliff 
Keen Arena witnessed a thriller 
Saturday night.

Coming off a 3-0 loss to 

Michigan 
State 
in 
East 

Lansing in 
the previous meeting Sept. 30 
and with its Big Ten reputation 
at 
stake, 
the 
Michigan 

volleyball team knew it could 
not fall to 1-3 in conference 
play. The Wolverines bounced 
back to beat the Spartans 3-2 in 
stunning fashion after falling 
into a 2-0 hole early on.

The 
Spartans 
displayed 

excellent blocking from the 
first set, blocking seven shots 
throughout 
the 
set. 
The 

Spartans took the set, 25-18, 
with Michigan recording just 
12 kills and a meager 15.6 attack 
percentage.

The 
second 
set 
was 

competitive 
until 
Michigan 

State went on a 4-0 run to take 
a 20-16 lead, which led the 
Wolverines to take a timeout. 
The Spartans continued their 
surge, finishing the set with a 
victory 25-21.

Despite a 2-0 deficit, the 

Wolverines responded strongly.

“After getting down, 2-0, we 

just wanted to go after it,” said 
sophomore 
right-side 
hitter 

Katherine Mahlke, who ended 
the night with 14 kills. “We 
weren’t going to roll over and 
let Michigan State take a 3-0 
win over us.”

Down 
2-0, 
sophomore 

defensive specialist Caroline 
Knop 
showcased 
aggressive 

hitting 
and 
unparalleled 

intensity in the third set. 

She finished the game with a 
double-double of 13 kills and 
17 digs. After the set was tied, 
12-12, Michigan pulled ahead 
with five straight points to lead, 
17-12. The Wolverines closed 
the set with a 25-20 victory.

Michigan was in the driver’s 

seat for the fourth set, as a 
dynamic offense pushed the 
Wolverines to a dominant 25-13 
win to tie the match.

The fifth and final set was 

highlighted by the performance 
of sophomore opposite hitter 
Adeja Lambert, who had four 
kills in the set. After falling 
behind, 9-10, the Wolverines 
rallied and scored six straight 
points to win the set 15-10.

“When you have a team like 

Michigan State, you always 
have to give your best and go 
hard all the time,” Lambert 
said. “When we did that in the 
final set, things turned around 
really quickly.”

Added Michigan coach Mark 

Rosen: “I’m really proud of 
Adeja. She’s such a hard worker 
— she’s just getting better every 
day. I’m really proud of how 
she’s developing. She’s still a 
young player, but she’s carrying 
a lot of the load right now.”

Although 
Rosen 
showed 

enthusiasm over his team’s 
victory, 
he 
stressed 
the 

importance 
of 
the 
team’s 

growth. Despite a 12-3 start 
and being ranked No. 23 in the 
country, they remain seventh in 
the Big Ten standings.

“Michigan 
State 
is 
very 

physical,” Rosen said. “They’re 
one of the more physical teams 
in the Big Ten. As soon as we 
spread them out, we started 
to create more space between 
their blockers so I thought that 
was the biggest difference our 
offense made.”

Added Mahlke: “Every point 

is as important as the last so I 
think our mentality was that we 
didn’t want to give up even one. 
I think going after every point 
made the difference.”

‘M’ cruises past Toronto

Wolverines 

break open home 
exhibition game in 

third period

By JASON RUBINSTEIN

Daily Sports Editor

Michigan hockey coach Red 

Berenson said earlier this week 
he wanted to find out what 
kind of team he had after the 
Wolverines’ top three point 
scorers 
either 
graduated 
or 

signed with an NHL club.

If Sunday’s exhibition against 

Toronto 
was 
any 

indication, 
the 
wily 

veteran coach found out in a 
manner of seconds. Just 10 ticks 
into the game, senior forward 
Justin Selman took a pass from 
senior forward Boo Nieves and 
found twine for what he called 
the fastest goal he has ever 
scored.

“That’s one of those things 

that is a kiss of death,” Berenson 
said, “but tonight, it was good.”

The 13th-ranked Wolverines 

cruised 
from 
there, 
beating 

Toronto 8-1. Michigan dominated 
the Varsity Blues from the 
opening puck drop, outshooting 
them 21-3 in the first frame and 
54-12 for the game.

“It’s a hard game to gauge,” 

Berenson said.

Michigan’s 
attack 
was 

dormant 
for 
a 
while, 
but 

sophomore defenseman Zach 
Werenski doubled the score 
with five minutes left in second 
period when he found a loose 
puck outside of the dot and 
sniped it past Toronto netminder 
Michael Nishi. That’s when the 
Wolverines started to run away.

Less than a minute after 

Werenski’s 
goal, 
junior 

defenseman Nolan De Jong 
blasted one from the blue line 

that Nishi never saw. And soon 
after that, freshman forward 
Brendan Warren lit the lamp 
with a rebound opportunity.

Junior forward JT Compher 

had a memorable start to his 
season, after a slow start last 
year, scoring two goals in the 
third 
period. 

He first blasted 
in a one-timer 
and 
then 

sniped another 
in with seven 
minutes 
remaining 
in 

the game.

“It’s 
nice 

for a lot of 
guys 
to 
get 

goals tonight,” 
Compher said. “Overall, we are 
happy with the amount of shots 
we had.”

Last 
season, 
Michigan’s 

defense was its Achilles’ heel. 
But with a more experienced 
unit, 
and 
the 
addition 
of 

freshmen Nicholas Boka and 
Joeseph Cecconi, it looked liked 
a completely different group. 

The defense often immediately 
cleared the puck along the 
boards when it entered the zone, 
something the coaching staff 
heavily preached prior to the 
season.

One of the bigger storylines 

heading into the season was 

how freshman 
forward 
Kyle 
Connor 

would 
adjust 

to the college 
game 
after 

dominating 
the 
United 

States Hockey 
League 
for 

three seasons. 
It didn’t take 
long to notice 

there wasn’t much of a transition.

Connor was often in the right 

place at the right time, had a 
few point-blank chances and 
seemingly always made the 
smart play.

“He showed flashes of his 

quickness, his fast release, and 
he could’ve had a couple of goals 
tonight as easy as not,” Berenson 

said. “I think he’ll do great.”

Added Selman, Connor’s line 

mate: “I think he jumped in and 
made an impact. He’s living up 
to his name so far and set up Boo 
and I really well.”

Junior 
goaltender 
Zach 

Nagelvoort got the start between 
the pipes after Berenson refused 
to name a starter earlier in the 
week. Berenson said Nagelvoort, 
senior 
Steve 
Racine 
and 

freshman Chad Catt would all 
see time. So after Nagelvoort 
stopped all three shots in the 
first period, Berenson opted to 
put senior Steve Racine in net 
for the second period and Catt 
for the third.

After the game, Berenson 

didn’t say who he’d start for the 
regular-season opener in two 
weeks.

Racine saw just five shots 

but let in a goal off a tricky 
redirection, while Catt made 
saves on each shot he faced. And 
with an offense that already 
looks like it has potential to be 
better than last year’s, Berenson 
has a reason to smile.

‘M’ dominates in 
Louisville meet

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Daily Sports Writer

Mason 
Ferlic 
knew 
that 

making his season debut in the 
fourth cross country meet of the 
year would be a test of how well 
he has trained so far. When the 
fifth-year senior came in first 
place in a field of 213 athletes, he 
passed that test.

He was one of just six athletes 

to finish under 24 minutes with a 
time of 23:51.52.

Saturday, the Michigan men’s 

and women’s cross country teams 
traveled to Louisville, Ky., to 
compete in the Greater Louisville 
Classic. The men’s 8,000-meter 
race started off the day, and Ferlic 
set the tone for the Wolverines. 
His performance helped lead 
the Wolverines to a second-place 
finish to complement the women’s 
first-place title.

“The plan was to delay the start 

of the season because my track 
season went so long,” Ferlic said. 
“My focus is on the championship 
season, so I felt like I didn’t need 
the race experience but I just 
wanted to get in some intense 
training. So that’s what I did, and 
it paid off. 

“I feel like I’m the most fit I’ve 

ever been, and I feel like I’m at 
a point where I can sustain this 
level and keep it going. This race 
was an affirmation.”

Ferlic led a tight pack with just 

10 seconds between him and the 
seventh-place finisher, earning 
his first individual victory since 
the Notre Dame Blue & Gold 
Invitational in 2014. His absence 
has been noticeable in previous 
events this season, even though 
it gave several other athletes a 
chance to shine.

Nine of the 12 Michigan 

athletes competing made it into 
the top 50. Fifth-year senior 
Nick Posada (20th), redshirt 
sophomore Micah Beller (38th) 
and redshirt junior Jarred Bratley 
(53rd) all ran personal bests. 

Not to be outdone, the women 

clinched not only first, but second 
place as well, with junior Erin 
Finn and senior Shannon Osika 

recording times of 16:48.23 and 
16:50.09, respectively. The two 
led the Wolverines to a first-place 
finish on the 5,000-meter course, 
making this the eighth straight 
time Finn has led the team to 
victory.

Finn only realized it was her 

teammate that was trailing her 
during the last moments of the 
race — something that made the 
last half-mile more enjoyable. 

“Racing against a different 

team’s athlete is much different 
than racing against your own,” 
Finn said. “During the race, it 
was harder than I thought — I 
went in with slightly dead legs 
from practicing too hard. It was 
definitely a grind, but I just looked 
ahead and told myself, ‘You’ve 
done this before, you can do it 
again.’ I knew it was going to hurt, 
but I did it.”

On top of Finn’s resilience, 

five athletes claimed personal 
records, including Osika, junior 
Gina Sereno (eighth), redshirt 
sophomore Sophie Linn (16th), 
her classmate Jamie Phelan (18th) 
and senior Taylor Manett (25th). 

Michigan women’s head coach 

Mike McGuire has made the 
Wolverines’ depth a consistent 
factor on the team. According to 
him this weekend was “their best 
to date.”

“Last year we had a lot of 

pressure ranked as No. 1, and 
it got to our heads so we didn’t 
race as well,” Osika said. “We’re 
learning to race together and 
feed off of each other. We are 
exactly where we need to be 
fitness-wise. We have been doing 
some really great workouts and 
I feel like our progression is 
escalating.”

The course will be the site of the 

NCAA Championships on Nov. 
21, so the runners felt it helped 
them prepare for championship 
season. Both Michigan coaches — 
Kevin Sullivan for the men’s and 
McGuire for the women’s — are 
focused on replicating this win. 

And for the men’s squad, 

they’re looking especially for 
that Big Ten win after finishing 
runner-up for the past two years.

Five Things We Learned

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

There 
was 
no 
Hurricane 

Joaquin in College Park, and there 
weren’t many surprises, either.

The No. 18 Michigan football 

team rolled to a 28-0 win 
over 
Maryland 
on 
Saturday, 

dispatching the Terrapins in 
businesslike fashion.

Here are five things we learned 

from the Wolverines’ second 
consecutive shutout:

1. Shutting out BYU was no 
fluke.

While the Terrapins’ offense 

wasn’t as potent as the Cougars’ 
last week, the Wolverines’ defense 
was every bit as dominant. 
Michigan now owns the nation’s 
second-ranked defense in both 
yards and points allowed, and it 
doesn’t appear to be slowing down 
any time soon.

Maryland quarterbacks C.J. 

Rowe and Daxx Garman were 
hurried all game, just like BYU’s 
Tanner Mangum a week before, 
and the Wolverines allowed just 
105 yards for the second game in 
a row. They also racked up eight 
tackles for loss, right on pace with 
their season average.

Redshirt sophomore defensive 

tackle Maurice Hurst, who had a 
sack for the third game in a row, 
delivered the most telling line 
about the Wolverines’ defense 
after the game Saturday. Asked 
where the defense could still 
improve, Hurst said: “We had a 
couple plays where they got first 
downs. … We’ve gotta look at that 
and correct it. They shouldn’t 
have anything.”

If Michigan’s goal is to not give 

up anything, not even a measly 
first down, opposing offenses 
should be very concerned.

2. Drake Johnson is nearing 
2014 form.

The redshirt junior running 

back is recovered from his second 
anterior cruciate ligament tear, 
and he’s nearing top shape. He 
had two touchdowns Saturday — 
one receiving, one rushing — to 
pair with 99 all-purpose yards.

If 
the 
Drake 
Johnson 
of 

November 2014 can emerge for 
the Wolverines, he would be an 
invaluable asset as a change of 
pace to bruising junior running 
back De’Veon Smith.

Smith missed the Maryland 

game with an ankle injury, and 
his status is uncertain this week. 
But with Johnson in the fold, 
Michigan has an agile option 
to pair with its stable of power 
backs.

3. Fumble-itis is inevitable.

Until Saturday, no Wolverine 

running back had fumbled all 
season. But against Maryland, 
redshirt sophomore Ty Isaac 
fumbled twice, and fifth-year 
senior quarterback Jake Rudock 
also coughed one up. Isaac 
recovered one drop, but the backs’ 
formerly perfect track record now 
has a blemish.

Some of that can be attributed 

to the nasty weather in College 
Park, but mostly, it was a matter of 
time. One lost fumble by a running 
back in five games is hardly reason 
for complaint.

But 
No. 
13 
Northwestern, 

which boasts the No. 1 scoring 
defense in the country, comes 
to Ann Arbor this week and will 
be ready to capitalize on any 
mistakes Michigan makes.

4. The fly sweep flies for 
Michigan.

Redshirt junior receiver Jehu 

Chesson scored his second rushing 
— yes, rushing — touchdown of 
the season on a fly sweep. Chesson 
streaked down the left sideline for 
66-yard touchdown, showing off 
blazing speed.

Two weeks earlier, against 

UNLV, Chesson scored a 36-yard 
touchdown on a similar play. 
Those plays add a much-needed 
big-play threat to an offense that 
can be otherwise simplistic.

A 
simple 
offense 
is 
not 

necessarily a bad thing, but being 
able to break a big gain now and 
then will go a long way as the 
Wolverines schedule gets more 

competitive.

5. Bold Prediction: College 
GameDay comes to Ann Arbor 
on Oct. 17.

The narratives are almost too 

juicy to resist. Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh could be fresh off 
a win over No. 13 Northwestern, 
the second ranked foe Michigan 
would have beaten this season.

Michigan State will likely still 

be ranked in the top five, setting 
up a high-profile stage for a 
rivalry game that hasn’t been to 
Ann Arbor since 2012. If the stars 
align and the Wolverines are 5-1 
and the Spartans 6-0, it would be 
tough to pass for ESPN.

Then again, that weekend will 

also feature No. 11 Florida at No. 7 
LSU, No. 8 Alabama at No. 9 Texas 
A&M, and No. 17 USC at No. 15 
Notre Dame. Those matchups will 
all be tempting sites, especially 
since GameDay hasn’t been to an 
SEC school since Week 3.

Still, between Harbaugh, the 

in-state rivalry and the major Big 
Ten East implications it could 
have, Ann Arbor will be just too 
enticing to pass up.

Good, bad and 
ugly: Maryland

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Each 
week, 
the 
Michigan 

football team gets better, and 
each week, its success becomes 
more legitimate.

This 
week 
brought 
the 

Wolverines’ first win on the road 
and in the Big Ten, a 28-0 rout 
of Maryland in College Park. 
In the past four games, they 
have outscored their opponents 
by a combined score of 122-14, 
cruising to four consecutive wins.

What may be more important, 

though, is what comes next. 
Michigan (1-0 Big Ten, 4-1 
overall) could now be considered 
a contender in the Big Ten East. 
While the Wolverines have been 
dominant in the past month, 
preseason favorites Ohio State 
and Michigan State, both 5-0, 
narrowly slipped by Indiana and 
Purdue, respectively, on Saturday.

Michigan 
faces 
a 
tough 

test Saturday against No. 13 
Northwestern (1-0 Big Ten, 5-0 
overall) before hosting the third-
ranked Spartans on Oct. 16.

Before they move forward, 

here are the good, the bad and the 
ugly from Saturday’s game:

The good

The defense was quite good. 

And it’s safe to put them in this 
space for the foreseeable future.

The stats were overwhelming 

again: 29 rushing yards, 76 passing 
yards, three interceptions, 2.1 
yards per pass attempt, 1-for-18 
on third downs.

And zero points — again.
Defensive 
coordinator 
D.J. 

Durkin’s unit is firing on all 
cylinders, from the linemen who 
combined for five tackles for loss, 
to the linebackers who forced 
extra pressure on Maryland’s 
quarterbacks, to the secondary 
that picked off two passes and 
broke up three more passes.

Other individual performances 

stood out: redshirt junior wide 
receiver Jehu Chesson scored on 
another end-around run from 66 
yards out, redshirt junior running 
back Drake Johnson (13 carries, 
68 yards) moved closer to a full 
workload and redshirt freshman 
defensive back Jabrill Peppers 
added a 29-yard punt return.

The bad

Hurricane 
Joaquin, 
which 

moved kickoff up from 8 p.m. to 
noon, held off for the duration 
of the game, but the conditions 
still weren’t ideal. The slippery 
footballs may have played a role 
in the game’s six total turnovers, 
and the wind affected the special 
teams game. In the first half, 
Michigan senior kicker Kenny 
Allen missed a 47-yard field goal, 
while Maryland punted short 
twice for 20 and 28 yards.

The Wolverines’ offense also 

struggled to find a spark in the 
first half, managing just six 
points. At that point, Michigan 
had just 16 carries for 43 yards, 
with 20 of them coming on one 
scramble by fifth-year senior 
quarterback Jake Rudock.

Michigan did clean up its 

mistakes in the second half, 
though. Halftime adjustments, 
more energy and a depleted 
Maryland defense combined to 
create 22 points and put the game 
out of reach.

The ugly

Michigan’s turnover problem 

reared its head again.

The Wolverines gave the ball 

away three times, twice in their 
own territory. Late in the first 
quarter, Rudock fumbled as he 
was sacked on 4th-and-2 at the 
Maryland 29. If Michigan had 
kept the drive alive, it could have 
moved closer to field-goal range 
and gotten on the scoreboard.

On the first play of the next 

drive, junior running back Ty 
Isaac lost a fumble on a run up the 
middle. He later coughed the ball 
up again but fell on it immediately. 
And on the first series of the 
second half, Rudock threw an 
interception off a tipped ball to 
Maryland 
defensive 
lineman 

Quinton Jefferson.

On 
a 
more 
serious 
note, 

senior defensive lineman Mario 
Ojemudia left the game on 
crutches in the fourth quarter, and 
Michigan suspects an Achilles 
injury. If it’s a torn Achilles, it 
would end Ojemudia’s season and 
Michigan career — a tough break 
for a player who recorded half a 
sack and 1.5 tackles for loss before 
his injury Saturday.

‘M’ survives rally, ties Wisconsin

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

In the 21st minute of the 

Michigan men’s soccer game 
Saturday, 
freshman 
midfielder 
Francis 
Atuahene received a pass at 
midfield, turned his defender, 
took off down the left sideline 
and fired a dangerous left-footed 
shot from outside the 18-yard 
box.

Wisconsin goalkeeper Adrian 

Remeniuk made one of his six 
saves on the day but was unable 
to corral it, and the ball spilled 
out to a waiting Colin McAtee, 
who pounced on the rebound to 
put the Wolverines up 2-1. The 
fifth-year 
senior 
midfielder’s 

second goal of the contest 
Saturday looked to be the game-
winner for Michigan.

It 
wasn’t, 
as 
Wisconsin 

mountain a furious rally in 
the second half, forcing the 
Wolverines to buckle down on 
defense just to secure a 3-3 tie.

The Badgers went up early 

on a shot through the legs of 
Michigan 
sophomore 
goalie 

Evan Louro, but the Wolverines 
equalized minutes later when 
junior defender Rylee Woods hit 
an indirect free kick into the box 
and McAtee used his height to 
beat his defender and head the 
ball in for a goal.

“I thought it was a good 

battle,” McAtee said. “They were 
two big boys. I wouldn’t say I 
necessarily had an advantage or 
disadvantage (physically) but I 
thought I did well on the goal to 
get around my man.”

Michigan tacked on a third 

goal for good measure when 
Atuahene 
improved 
his 
Big 

Ten-leading goal tally to seven 
with a curling shot from the 
left side of the 18-yard box that 
somehow snuck through the 
Wisconsin back line and past the 
outstretched hand of the Badger 
goaltender.

“(Atuahene) is the dribbler, 

(senior 
forward 
William 

Mellors-Blair) is kind of the 
runner and (McAtee) is kind of 

the target and the power,” said 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley. 
“We have a good combination of 
all three. They got it ticking for a 
little while, but the game slowed 
down.”

Added McAtee: “We’re all 

fast, but (Atuahene and Mellors-
Blair) are probably even a little 
quicker than me, and I think I’m 
more of the guy who’s better in 
the air and at getting headers 
and holding the ball up. You 
know they want to find the ball 
in space or out wide so they can 
attack players one on one.”

The good times did not last 

for the Wolverines, however, 
as 
Wisconsin 
midfielder 

Christopher Mueller curled a 
free kick over the Michigan wall 
and into the back of the net just 
before the end of the first half.

The Badgers completed the 

comeback just three minutes 
into the second half when 
forward Nick Jones capitalized 
on a loose ball inside Michigan’s 
18-yard line to tie the game at 3.

Throughout the second half, 

Michigan and Wisconsin battled 

to take the lead, though neither 
team could gain an advantage, 
and the game went to sudden-
death overtime.

The Wolverines’ best chance 

during overtime came when 
sophomore 
defender 
Billy 

Stevens put a dangerous free 
kick into the Wisconsin box, but 
Michigan was unable to take 
advantage of the scoring chance. 
Despite controlling possession 
and outshooting the Badgers 
8-0, the Wolverines couldn’t put 
the finishing touch on the game.

“I think we weren’t at our best 

today,” Daley said. “I thought we 
played OK. I think we could have 
played better, certainly done 
some things better at home, but 
the big picture is that in the Big 
Ten standings, after the halfway 
point we’re on eight points, and 
that’s an important thing.”

Halfway through the Big 

Ten season, the Wolverines sit 
atop the conference, but will 
be looking to improve their 
ability to close out games in 
their quest for a regular-season 
championship.
