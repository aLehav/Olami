Report identifies 
attributes likely to 
improve assessment, 

teaching methods

By SARAH KHAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Imagine playing the video of 

game League of Legends to learn 
in a classroom.

While multiplayer, online, bat-

tle-type games will not be used in 
most classes in the near future, a 
new study by University research-
ers shows how digital game use in 
the classroom can help teachers 
track student learning.

A report from the A-GAMES 

Project, released last Thursday 
by professors from the School of 
Information and New York Uni-
versity, focuses on common fea-
tures in games that are effective 
in assessment and learning. The

Analyzing Games for Assessment 

Stephen Strobbe to 
deliver honorary 
lecture March 31

By ANASTASSIOS 
ADAMOPOULOS

Daily Staff Reporter

About 30 minutes into his lec-

ture Wednesday morning, Nurs-
ing Prof. Stephen Strobbe was 
caught off-guard by a group of 

students who offered congratu-
lations and presented him with 
a bouquet of flowers, balloons 
and an apple.

The Golden Apple award 

honors one teacher on campus 
each year chosen based on stu-
dent nominations. The award is 
sponsored by the University of 
Michigan Hillel and more than 
two dozen other campus organi-
zations and units.

To announce the selection, 

the Golden Apple committee 

surprises the recipient, typi-
cally in the middle of their class. 
Strobbe said he was very sur-
prised when the students hand-
ed him the gifts.

“Does someone want to tell 

me what is going on?” he asked.

After being told that he had 

won the Golden Apple, Strob-
be was speechless for a few 
moments.

“Thank you all so much,” he 

said. “I am moved beyond words. 

Annual event 
features student 
groups, musical 
performances

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

SpringFest will stick around 

a bit longer this year.

The annual SpringFest out-

door festival will expand into 
three different areas and, for 
the first time since its start in 
2011, will cover multiple days.

For the past three years, 

MUSIC Matters, has held the 
annual event to provide an 
opportunity for local musicians, 
artists, restaurants and Univer-
sity student organizations to 
engage with the broader cam-
pus community.

The festival features a head-

lining musical act in Hill Audi-
torium. Previous performers 
have included J. Cole, Ben 
Folds, 2 Chainz and Chance the 

Rapper. This year’s act has yet 
to be announced.

Business 
senior 
Nicholas 

Moeller, SpringFest chair, said 
the event will highlight Univer-
sity student organizations that 
fit the following five categories: 
sustainability, innovation, arts, 
community service and social 
identity.

To engage students’ entre-

preneurial spirit, Moeller said 
SpringFest will also feature 
“Startup Village,” a hub that 
will include student-run or stu-
dent-founded startups from the 
Ann Arbor area.

“It’s an opportunity to engage 

the broader campus community 
as well as showcase the best of 
what Michigan has to offer,” he 
said. “So, it’s an event that tries 
to bring together students from 
all corners of campus.”

A film festival, a new Spring-

Fest feature, will start in the 
evening on April 16 and contin-
ue during the main festival day 
on April 17.

Decrease in 

higher education 
appropriations tied 
to tuition increases

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Following statewide elections 

in which higher education was a 
point of debate, this article is the 
third in a series examining the 
changing landscape of higher edu-

cation funding in Michigan, and 
what those changes mean for four-
year universities.

In his opening remarks at last 

Thursday’s Board of Regents 
meeting, University President 
Mark Schlissel thanked Gov. 
Rick Snyder (R) for recommend-
ing a 2-percent increase in state 
appropriations for higher educa-
tion in fiscal year 2016.

“We appreciate the governor’s 

support for higher ed, especially 
at a time when the state must 
make difficult choices regarding 
spending,” he said.

However, 
even 
with 
the 

increase — which totaled a 1.9-per-
cent funding increase specifically 
for the University — state appro-
priations are nowhere near where 
they used to be at their peak.

This year, state appropriations 

made up 9 percent of the Univer-
sity’s operating budget, excluding 
the University of Michigan Health 
System. In contrast, during the 
1960s, state appropriations covered 
78 percent of University expenses.

Over the course of half a 

decade, the state of Michigan has 
severely limited its higher educa-

tion funding. In an effort to fill the 
gap, the University has resorted 
to other sources for revenue — 
namely, raising student tuition.

Given a growing nationwide 

conversation on the rising cost 
of college, these increases have 
prompted discussion at the Univer-
sity on how to keep college afford-
able and accessible to all students, 
even while the institution is steadi-
ly losing state monetary support.

Art & Design hosts 
three day working 
period to create new 
medical equipment

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

Students, professionals and 

faculty University-wide joined 
forces to generate solutions to 
some of the challenges faced by 
Ebola patients.

Finding innovative solutions 

specific to the Ebola outbreak 
was the focus of a recent three-day 
design and planning period hosted 
by the School of Art and Design.

Caused by a strain of the 

Ebola virus, the disease is rare 
and deadly. The recent Ebola 
epidemic has been the largest in 
history. According to the Center 
for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, there have been 23,694 sus-
pected, probable and confirmed 
cases of Ebola in West Africa as of 
Feb. 21, and there have been four 
laboratory-confirmed cases in the 
United States.

In addition to the Art and 

Design School event, the Univer-
sity has created a response plan in 
the unlikely situation that Ebola 
reaches the University, as well as 
worked with the Michigan Nurses 
Association to take precautions for 
nurses who would treat the virus.

The event focused on creating 

equipment around three themes: 
protecting those caring for Ebola 
patients, improving communica-
tion in the face of cultural and lin-
guistic barriers and creating a safer 
way to transport infected patients.

Five teams, comprising five to 

eight participants from differ-
ent disciplines, conceptualized, 
designed and created a product 
to help patients affected by Ebola.

The first product met the chal-

lenge of the first theme: improving 
personal protective equipment. 
The protective suits previously 
employed fit only a small number 
of body types. They often tear and 
break and can expose caregivers 
to contaminating fluids.

Several solutions were created 

to solve this issue. The first, a dis-
posable doffing strap, makes the 
process of removing the bodysuit 
easier because wearers do not 
have to touch the outside of the

suit to remove it. The next item 
created was a visor-based protec-
tive garment — a garment that 
can be modified to fit the user, 
with a detachable visor that cov-
ers the head. The third is a glove 
removal tool. A disposable sticker, 
attached to the inside of the glove, 
allows for easier removal of the 
glove.

Josh 
Botkin, 
entrepreneur 

in residence at the Ross School 
of Business, was a member of 
this group. He said he was very 
impressed with the high quality 
of the concepts designed in the 
project.

“There was such strong spirit 

of collaboration and shared pur-
pose that were really apparent 
throughout the entire event,” 
Botkin said.

The second product met the 

challenge of improving commu-
nication across cultural and lin-
guistic barriers.

When patients are tested posi-

tive for Ebola, they often have to 
say goodbye to their families to 
be treated. Since patients are not 
supposed to touch anyone else, 
saying goodbye to loved ones can 
be more painful in that the pro-
cess lacks physical contact. The 
solution to the problem comes in 
the form of the Embrace, a large 
fabric panel that allows a hug 
between an infected person and 
a non-infected person.

The third product aims to 

improve 
personal 
protective 

equipment by creating a sheet, 
the 
Transformative 
Tyvek, 

which assists in the hygienic 
handling of fluids and bod-
ies. The sheet can be worn to 
cover the body of someone who 
is handling an Ebola patient. It 
includes directions to use the 
sheet as a bed sheet, vomit con-
tainer, apron, mask and body 
bag.

Art and Design senior Kelly 

Sadlon was a member of the 
group that created the Trans-
formative Tykev sheet. She said 
though each group was working 
on separate projects, they were 
collaborating with each other 
because each group knew what 
the others were doing.

“It was a great chance to build 

my leadership qualities and a 
good experience working in an 
interdisciplinary environment,” 
Sadlon said. “I’ve had a few 
experiences working with inter-
disciplinary fields but not with 
public health or engineering so 
it was very interesting to gain 
that perspective. When you’re 
working in an interdisciplinary 
team, you’re admitting that you 
don’t have all of the knowledge 
and you learn to cooperate with 
people.”

The 
fourth 
product 
was 

designed to improve health 
communication across cultural 
and linguistic barriers. The 
Ebola Survival Radio works 
to 
improve 
communication 

between workers and villagers. 
It will also serve as a way for 
survivors and family members 
of those affected to share their 
stories.

In 
an 
e-mail 
interview, 

Corinne Lee, who is in the 
School of Nursing’s Doctor of 
Nursing Practice program and 
was a member of the Ebola Sur-
vival Radio group, wrote that 
the most rewarding part of the 
project was that it did not stop 
after the competition ended.

“We are now told that the 

prototypes have been taken 
over to be considered for uti-
lization in West Africa,” Lee 
wrote. “And that was a reward-
ing moment that I have been 
involved in something that 
could impact more than just my 
little world.”

Participants also created a 

guide for family members car-
ing for an Ebola patient in a low-
income area. The guide shows 
situations where everyday items 
can be used to limit the risk of 
contamination while caring for 
and cleaning up after the con-
taminated person.

Botkin said the event show-

cased the University’s ability to 
provide students with powerful 
experiential learning that can 
also benefit society.

“I look forward to seeing 

some of the teams’ designs 
move out into the world, where 
they can help improve the health, 
safety and well-being of Ebola 
patients, their family members 
and healthcare workers in Africa 
and beyond,” Botkin said.

laborated 
with 
film-oriented 

student organizations such as 
M-Agination Films and the Film 
and Video Student Association 
to select a line-up of films to dis-
play. Moeller said they hope to 
screen those films at the begin-
ning of the festival and end the 
evening with a keynote speaker 
provided through the Univer-
sity’s Department of Screen Arts 
and Culture.

“Our idea was really to reach 

more areas of campus to pro-
mote some student films, pro-
mote some student work in areas 

we haven’t highlighted in past 
years,” he said. “Organizations 
like that already have a pretty 
large depository of student films 
and they’ll be sending us some 
of the ones they’d like to screen 
at the event.”

MUSIC Matters President 

Darren 
Appel, 
a 
Business 

senior, said he is excited about 
the event’s the multi-day sched-
ule.

“Since the beginning, the 

goal has always been to create 
this end-of-the-year capstone 
festival event where it’s multi-
ple days long and we’re reaching 
all areas of campus, and engag-
ing as many people as possible,” 
Appel said. “So, I think this is 

the first installment of making 
that long-term goal a reality, 
and I’m really excited to expand 
in that sense.”

LSA senior Marli Siegel, 

Spring Fest communications 
director, said she is looking 
forward to seeing interaction 
between student organizations 
and the student body at large.

“We’re making such progress 

with making this an event so 
that student groups showcase 
what they’re doing at the Uni-
versity and really highlighting 
all of their accomplishments,” 
Siegel said.

“I think seeing that come into 

fruition is really the most excit-
ing and the most rewarding 

thing for sure. All of the addi-
tions and all of the expansions 
that we’re doing I think are only 
going to elevate and propel that 
even further from what we’ve 
achieved in the past.”

Though the University hosts 

several student organization 
showcases, such as Festifall and 
Winterfest, Appel said Spring-
Fest is unique.

“These are engaging and 

interactive displays where the 
students can actually come and 
not only talk to the students in 
the different student orgs and 
startups, but actually touch 
and feel and gauge at whatever 
the product is or event is that 
they’re displaying,” Appel said.

The video games used in the 

study are different than typical 
video games. According to Jan 
Plass, education communica-
tion and technology professor 
at NYU, video games in learning 
are designed with purposes and 
goals fundamentally different 
from games for entertainment.

“In a game for learning we 

have to ask what primary educa-
tional function the game should 
have, and what learning goals 
they will serve,” Plass said. “In 
our study the games were more 
on the level of acquiring new 
skills and automating these 
skills. Based on these goals the 
way the game has to be designed 
is fundamentally different.”

The first part of the study, 

released in December, was con-
ducted as a series of nationwide 
surveys to teachers.

The study found that of the 27 

percent of teachers who use digi-
tal games for teaching monthly, 34 
percent use it as a form of formative 
assessment, or as a way to track stu-
dent progress with the material.

“Formative assessment is a 

very common and very impor-
tant practice in K-12 education,” 
said Education Prof. Barry Fish-
man, who is also a professor of 
Informatics. “In general, you 
want some checkpoints to see 
how well students understand 

material and change the way 
you’re teaching for people who 
need different kinds of sup-
port. Its like temperature taking 
along the way.”

According to the data, teachers 

who are frequent users of games did 
more formative assessments than 
teachers who are not.

In the most recent A-GAMES 

report, 
released 
Thursday, 

researchers observed and inter-
viewed 30 teachers in New York. 

Researchers 
asked 
teach-

ers what features of the game 
proved most useful in making 
sense out of learning. These fea-
tures included feedback systems 
that used points or stars, screen 
capture and dashboards to track 
player progress.

Though the study provided 

insight into the benefits of these 
games, Fishman said there were 
also a lot of weaknesses. Game 
features such as points or stars 
were often hard for teachers to 
interpret.

According to Plass, the obser-

vation of how teachers use video 
games for formative assess-
ment in the classroom, and the 
feedback received from teach-
ers, allowed them to make rec-
ommendations for video game 
designers to help them under-
stand which features of games 
are most useful in assessment 
and learning.

“We hope that our study 

unblocks the gridlock between 
what happens in the classroom 
and what should be put in the 
games as features,” she said.

unanimously agreed to increase 
this year’s tuition by 1.6 percent 
for in-state undergraduate stu-
dents and 3.4 percent for out-of-
state undergraduate students.

Before casting her vote, Regent 

Andrea Fischer Newman (R) 
asked if there was a point when 
the University could stop increas-
ing its price tag.

“It concerns me that many peo-

ple have asked for a higher appropri-
ation from the state every year, and 
the state is starting to respond, and 
I appreciate that,” Newman said. 
“But, I think we need to be respon-
sible stewards of that increase. So 
I wonder why we have to have an 
increase in tuition when the state is 
stepping up to the plate.”

University 
Provost 
Martha 

Pollack responded at the meeting, 
saying that though the University 
is invested in keeping costs low 
for students, it must raise revenue 
to continue hiring top faculty and 
updating campus infrastructure.

“We do work extremely hard … 

but we also really need to protect 
the excellence of the University,” 
Pollack said.

This year’s tuition increase fol-

lows the regents’ 2013 decision to 
bump tuition by 1.1 percent, the 
lowest hike in 29 years.

According to financial reports 

from Tim Slottow, the former 
University chief financial offi-
cer, the University’s tuition hikes 
have been among the lowest in the 
state and in the Big Ten over the 
past several years.

“Tuition and state appropria-

tions are the primary sources 
of funding for the University’s 
academic programs. There is a 
direct relationship between the 
growth or reduction in state sup-
port and the University’s ability 
to restrain tuition fee increases,” 
Slottow stated in the 2006 finan-
cial report, while still in the role 
of chief financial officer.

In response to the University’s 

effort to keep tuition percent 
changes low, Snyder awarded the 
campus an additional $1.1 million 
in state funding, the third-largest 
state grant in 2012.

Regardless of efforts in recent 

years, however, the University 
has increased its tuition by at least 
1 percent, and sometimes more, 
each year since 2002.

A decade ago, the Board of 

Regents approved a 12.3-percent 
hike in tuition for in-state stu-
dents and a 6.9-percent raise for 
out-of-state students — the largest 
percentage increase since the turn 
of the century at the University.

“This is unprecedented in the 

history of the University,” then-
Provost Paul Courant told the Daily.

Though 
each 
subsequent 

increase in tuition was 5 per-
centage points or less, overall 
the University’s base tuition for 
those enrolled in the College of Lit-
erature, Science and the Arts has 
increased 60 percent for in-state 
students and 55 percent for out-of-
state students from 2005 to 2014.

In an interview with the Daily, 

Cynthia 
Wilbanks, 
University 

vice president of government 
relations, said tuition rates have 
a direct relationship with state 
funding. Rising tuition, she said, 
can be explained by dwindling 
state funding.

Over the past decade, state 

appropriations to the University 
have declined by 40 percent on a 
per-student basis, when adjusted 
for inflation.

“I think the state had a much 

greater role in funding high-
er education prior to this last 
decade,” Wilbanks said.

According 
to 
information 

provided by the office of the 
University’s vice president for 
global communications and stra-

tegic initiatives, tuition rates vary 
somewhat between different col-
leges within the University, cred-
it-hour loads and class standing.

Tuition money goes to the 

general fund and helps pay for 
instruction, financial aid, advis-
ing and libraries. It does not pay 
for athletics, the health system, 
construction or housing.

In an interview last week, 

University Regent Denise Ilitch 
(D), who has voted against most 
tuition increases over her tenure 
on the board, said she believes it 
is extremely important to keep 
higher education affordable for 
all Michigan residents.

“I think that it’s extremely 

important that we make higher 
education accessible to our Mich-
igan residents and to make sure 
that it’s affordable to all, and not 
just people of means,” Ilitch said.

Though pleased at the slowing 

rate of tuition increases, Ilitch 
said there are many facets in 
keeping tuition down, including 
controlling costs and being more 
efficient when spending.

“I would love to see that, just 

one year, not to increase tuition,” 
she added.

Keeping the University 

affordable

As tuition costs go up, how-

ever, the University has explored 
affordability efforts in other 
areas. This year, the board also 
agreed to a $19.5 million increase 
in financial aid — part of a general 
trend of increasing financial aid 
faster than the rate of tuition.

“What (the increase) will allow 

us to do is ensure that students 
with need, as we have done in 
the last few years, will not see 
an increase in the cost of atten-
dance,” Pollack said in a 2013 
interview with the Daily.

This tuition increases occur 

as state-funded opportunities for 
financial aid have grown scarcer.

Along with decreasing fund-

ing for higher education, the state 
of Michigan has cut initiatives to 
help low- to middle-income stu-
dents pay for college such as the 
Michigan Promise Scholarship 
program in 2009, a merit-based 
scholarship for students with 
exceptional 
Michigan 
Educa-

tional Assessment Program, or 
MEAP, standardized test scores.

State Rep. Amanda Price (R–Hol-

land), chair of the state’s Education 
Committee, said cutting scholarships 
like the MEAP scholarship was, in 
some senses, unavoidable.

“I think that’s impacted some 

folks, I’m sure it has, even low- 
to middle-income students have 
been impacted by that cut,” Price 
said. “But that was driven by the 
budget realities that the state had 
been facing and continues to face.”

According to figures from the 

U.S. Department of Education, 
listed in the most recent Office of 
Budget Planning almanac, the aver-
age state grant has decreased by 
$2,608 per student. However, the 
University has increased the aver-
age need-based grant it provides to 
undergraduate students by $4,774 
through its own fund since 2002.

Though the University’s aver-

age state grant per need-based 
student is the second lowest 
among all public institutions in 
the Association of American Uni-
versities after MSU, it provides the 
second-highest amount of aid to 
students from its own resources at 
an average of $12,233 per student.

The number of need-based grants 

generally varies based on several fac-
tors, chiefly the income distribution 
among students at an institution.

Wilbanks said when it comes 

to deciding where to protect Uni-
versity funding while setting the 
budget and enacting cuts, aca-
demics and the student experi-
ence are a key focus.

“Here a very, very important 

decision was made that the aca-
demic quality of the institution 

had to be the number one prior-
ity, and in making it a number one 
priority you make decisions along 
the way to support your being able 
to invest in those high priorities — 
student experience, faculty excel-
lence and the overall academic 
excellence of the University,” Wil-
banks said.

In November 2013, partially 

in continuation of that push, the 
University launched the Victors 
for Michigan campaign — the 
largest fundraising drive for a 
public University in history.

The campaign, chaired by Ste-

phen Ross, set its goal to $4 bil-
lion, with $1 billion earmarked for 
financial support for students.

“We believe that by judiciously 

controlling our costs and tuition 
increases, while also committing 
University funds for financial aid, 
we can join with donors to make it 
possible for the best students, from 
any socioeconomic background, 
to afford to get a Michigan edu-
cation,” Newman, the University 
regent, said in a 2013 statement.

Changing student body
However, despite maintaining 

support for low-income students, 
the University student body has 
grown wealthier in recent years.

Since 2003, the number of 

University 
out-of-state 
under-

graduates who did not apply for 
financial aid or are from families 
making $150,000 or more annu-
ally has increased by 12 percent, 
according to the almanac.

In 2013, for both graduates and 

undergraduates, in-state students 
made up about 50.2 percent of the 
student body — 49.8 percent were 
either out-of-state or internation-
al students. This number of out-
of-state students has increased by 
7.2 percent since 2005.

In 
comparison, 
out-of-state 

students comprise around 10 
percent of Michigan State Uni-
versity’s student body, a school 
generally considered the Univer-
sity’s closest peer among public 
universities in the state.

Though the typical student 

with a family income at $80,000 or 
below pays less today to attend the 
University as they did in 2003, also 
according to the almanac, the num-
ber of those students is decreasing.

In contrast, the increase in 

non-resident students and their 
subsequent rise in tuition money 
amounted to an added $88 mil-
lion to the University’s general 
fund by 2013.

In an interview with The Mich-

igan Daily last week, E. Royster 
Harper, vice president for student 
life, said though low income stu-
dents are provided for from the 
school’s financial aid, students in 
the “middle,” socioeconomically, 
who don’t qualify for Pell Grants 
yet find the tuition too high, are 

still struggling financially.

“It really are the kids in the 

middle that get squeezed,” she 
said. 
“That’s 
where 
tuition 

becomes really critical.”

The University’s affordability 

efforts in comparison

Though the University has 

taken strides toward keeping col-
lege affordable for its students, it 
still falls behind in several key met-
rics, and in some cases, struggles 
to build a climate attractive to stu-
dents of low socioeconomic status.

According to Mark Burnham, 

vice president for governmen-
tal affairs at MSU, 54 percent of 
their students graduate without 
debt, compared to 46 percent of 
in-state University students. MSU 
is closest to the University in size, 
rank and athletics among public 
schools in the state.

The average amount of debt 

faced by students at MSU is 
$24,000. At the University of 
Michigan, that number is $25,575 
— a $1,575 difference — though 
it is worth noting that tuition at 
MSU is about $4,500 lower for in-
state freshman, and about $11,100 
lower for out-of-state freshmen.

Burnham said similar to the Uni-

versity, MSU has stayed affordable 
by increasing financial aid opportu-
nities for all students. He said MSU 
has increased financial aid by 45 
percent in the last five years.

“We certainly work very hard to 

make sure we have maximized finan-
cial aid as best we have,” he said.

Rachel Osmer, college adviser 

to Ypsilanti Community High 
School through the Michigan 
College Advising Corps, works 
primarily with students in Ypsi-
lanti who come from working- 
and middle-class backgrounds.

She said even though the Uni-

versity has a larger tuition sticker 
price, because of its endowment 
and large financial aid resources, 
many of Osmer’s students have 
the option of attending the school.

“Schools like U of M and 

MSU because they’re such large 
schools and such a large alumni 
network than newer schools, they 
have more money to offer from 
the school themselves than from 
the federal government,” she said.

However, Osmer said many of 

her students from low socioeco-
nomic backgrounds tend to apply 
to Central Michigan University, 
Eastern 
Michigan 
University, 

Western Michigan University or 
community colleges.

“For a lot of our students here 

in Ypsilanti, U of M, even though 
it’s right down the road, it’s still 
out of reach for them,” she said. 
“There is this stigma attached to 
the idea that U of M is an elitist, 
expensive school.”

Schools like CMU or EMU, she 

said, are more in her students’ 
comfort zones because other stu-
dents from similar backgrounds 
populate them.

“The people they see in that 

school are usually upper-middle-
class white men and women,” she 
said. “They’re not people that look 
like our students, so it’s not repre-
sentative of a school they would 
want to go to.”

Overall, Harper said state sup-

port is important, but doesn’t 
entirely address some of the socio-
economic issues students face.

“(Nothing) makes the cur-

rent price tag possible if you’re 
middle-class and out of state, so I 
think any support we get from the 
state is really important because 
it allows us to ask for less, but it 
won’t change sort of who comes to 
campus,” Harper said.

What an incredible honor.”

As the recipient of this year’s 

award, Strobbe will deliver the 
Golden Apple lecture on March 
31 at Rackham Auditorium. Each 
year, the winner is instructed to 
choose a lecture topic as if it is 
the last lecture he or she will ever 
give.

Business junior Jacob Berman, 

co-chair of the Golden Apple 
award committee, said there 
were 750 nominees since Jan. 
16, when this year’s nominations 
began, with well over 100 profes-
sors nominated.

“First of all, he got a ton of 

nominations,” 
Berman 
said, 

referring to Strobbe. “Clearly, he 

is someone who is beloved and 
just the way that so many stu-
dents said he has helped them 
personally, he is so inspiring in 
class and he’s helped them out 
of class, with what he’s done on 
campus. All that just made him 
such an obvious choice.”

Strobbe is the first director 

of the University’s Addiction 
Treatment Services, a clinic that 
provides treatment for those 
recovering from alcohol and 
drug addictions. In 2007, he was 
the recipient of the Administra-
tion Management Award by the 
International Nursing Society on 
Addictions for his work.

On his Nursing School web-

page, Strobbe notes that his main 
areas of academic interest are 
addiction, 
Alcoholics 
Anony-

mous, mental health and sub-

stance-use disorders, prevention, 
treatment and recovery, as well as 
spirituality.

After receiving the award, 

Strobbe informed his students 
that their scheduled midterm was 
still going to take place that day, 
though he admitted that this was 
the “best diversionary tactic” he 
had ever seen.

Nursing junior Kristina Bal-

lough, one of Strobbe’s students, 
said she nominated Strobbe.

“He is honestly the best teach-

er I’ve ever had,” she said. “He is 
just so passionate and enthusi-
astic about everything, and just 
makes it fun to learn and keeps 
your attention for a three-hour 
class, which is ridiculous. He 
does a great job.”

Children are like angels. Not 

clean, not innocent, but genderless. 
I’ve learned more information about 
angels in my 12 years in Catholic 
school than I care to account for. For 
instance, did you know that the fifth 
rank of angels controls the weather? 
Me either, and I have my doubts. But 
I digress.

Children, from my experience, 

are born with little sense of gender 
identity. I grew up with two little 
brothers as my only playmates. How-
ever, there never seemed to be a gen-
der gap. No one was better or worse 
because I liked fluffy purple sweaters 
and they didn’t.

There’s no “right” or “wrong” 

way to play when you are a child; at 
least there wasn’t for me. I played 
with my fair share of Rescue Heroes 
and train tracks and Hot Wheels. 
As we grow older, we’re told that 
boys and girls are different. Going 
to a Catholic school, I was condi-
tioned to look different and have 
different tasks than my male coun-
terparts. Through my intersecting 
identities as a woman and a Catho-
lic, I can reflect on specific gender 
norms I learned growing up and 
was expected to follow.

When I was five years old, I got 

my first makeup set. The glorious 
glitter lip gloss and bright blue eye 
shadow entertained me for hours. 
My brother Thomas, at the angelic 
age of three, would willingly be my 
model. After he was glamorized 
with only the finest dollar-store 
clip-on earrings money could buy, 
I would throw a purple feather boa 
around him and we would march 
downstairs. My mother would laugh 
and take pictures as he modeled and 
twirled around.

This wasn’t girly. It wasn’t dis-

couraged, just like racing Barbie’s 
purple Corvette alongside Thomas’ 
monster truck wasn’t “boyish.” We 
were playing dress up, experiencing 

a ritual that is deemed “normal” for 
children. So why, once my brothers 
graduated to the first grade, was my 
dad scolding them for asking me to 
paint their nails? Why was this sud-
denly not OK? My dad would call 
them “girly” like it was an insult. 
Suddenly, I lost my favorite play-
mates.

First grade began the uniforms. 

Oh, the horror! For the next 12 
years I would never stop hearing 
“pull your skirt down,” “don’t sit 
with your legs open” or “button up 
that blouse.” Any obvious sign that I 
had curves in my body was deemed 
sinful. If you were a woman, you 
better damn well be feminine, 
but don’t show your ankles … we 
wouldn’t want boys to actually 
realize that you’re a teenage girl 
or anything. Girls, of course, were 
permitted to wear pants, but they 
were unflattering, uncomfortable 
and socially unacceptable. The sta-
tus quo was wearing a skirt, rather 
a plaid kilt. The pressure to fit 
into the “correct” gender category 
 

was immense.

The curriculum included eight 

semesters of theology, one of which 
was morality. Every day there was 
a new argument about Catholic 
teachings. My teacher “proved” 
that Jesus taught that women 
shouldn’t be priests by picking only 
male apostles. Unless you were the 
Virgin Mary or striving to be her, 
you were comparable to Eve and her 
freaking apple. Each day brought a 
new and equally crazy lesson. The 
girls in the class would protest, and 
often debate would ensue. But alas, 
you can’t change what Moses wrote 
in stone. Alas, girls can’t be priests 
because, you know, Jesus said so. I 
think this is when I realized that 
there’s a serious mistreatment of 
women in my religion. As much as 
I identify as Catholic and have no 
intention to change that, I recog-

nized that my peers have internal-
ized this inexplicable view that 
women are subservient to men.

The worst was vocation day. I 

remember dreading it weeks in 
advance. The boys would go off 
with the priests and tour whatever 
seminary we were at. There was 
a pool table, a bar, a TV and video 
games. Here was your stereotypi-
cal man cave for these pious young 
men. Who the hell wouldn’t want to 
be a priest?

The girls would wait for the 

nuns and sisters to come talk to us. 
Now don’t get me wrong, they were 
always the sweetest and most self-
less women I had met. They dedi-
cated their lives to the poor and 
needy, and didn’t just pray, but were 
actively working in the community. 
However, they presented the veiled 
life as boring and restrictive. They 
were forced to wear modest cloth-
ing, covering anything that even 
hinted at the notion that they had 
breasts or hips. The sisters weren’t 
allowed to drink, watch TV or, for 
goodness sake, give sermons! They 
couldn’t stand at the pulpit and 
proclaim the Word — that would be 
putting them in a position too pow-
erful for their fragile female minds 
to handle. Nuns had to stay in their 
place, and, honestly, their lives 
seemed unimportant compared to 
the men.

We play dress up as kids and 

never truly grow out of it. So many 
adults today put on their masks, 
hiding their true identities, afraid 
of the consequences the truth could 
bring. We need to learn to restore 
the cherubic innocence we had 
when we were young, when gender 
didn’t matter. If we could live in a 
society where we could be our tru-
est selves, with the masks off, well 
wouldn’t that just be Paradise?

VERONICA DAY | VIEWPOINT

At the beginning of fall semester, all 

freshmen were asked to attend Relationship 
Remix, a workshop designed for first-year 
students where the main goals were to discuss 
how to lead healthy and happy relationships 
in college, focusing particularly on sexual 
assault. While there were things about it I 
would have changed, it’s a very important 
topic, and I commend the University for 
making this a priority.

Only a few days ago, I got a message in 

my inbox. The subject read: “Help improve 
Relationship Remix by taking this short 
survey!” Before I go further, I want to say it’s not 
my intention to criticize the survey as a whole. 
It’s commendable that there was a follow-up to 
the workshop to allow for feedback. However, 
I do want to point out something within the 
survey that points to a larger society issue.

I began filling it out, ready to give feedback 

as to what could make it better. The first few 
questions I answered in a heartbeat, confident 
in my answers. Then I got to questions 10 
through 20 that asked me to “indicate my level 
of agreement with this statement.” The first 
few I answered quickly. Yes, I am confident 
I “express my own needs and desires in 
relationships”; yes I strongly agree I know 
“what a healthy relationship looks like for me.” 
But nine statements in, I paused, admittedly 
horrified. The ninth statement read, “I 
intentionally make choices that reduce the risk 
I will experience sexual violence.”

This statement struck a deep chord. 

Although it was part of a survey intended to 
only take a short time and to be forgotten soon 
after, the survey left a horrible taste in my 
mouth and it echoes a problem faced across 
the country. It perpetuates the idea that it’s the 
survivors’ fault that they experience sexual 

violence because of the choices that they make. 
It isn’t clear enough, and it isn’t emphasized 
enough in society that no decision that anyone 
makes can implicate them in their own sexual 
assault. Sexual assault is never the fault of the 
victim, and by portraying it as such through 
statements like these, we simply make the 
problem of victim blaming worse. While it’s 
true we may privately make choices, knowing 
that they could put us in situations where 
we increase the risk of sexual assault (which 
is disheartening in and of itself), it should 
never be in the public discourse that it is up 
to potential victims to make choices to lower 
their risks of experiencing sexual assault.

One of the largest problems we face when 

it comes to sexual assault is how we handle it. 
Recently, lawmakers proposed to arm students 
on college campuses to combat sexual assault. 
We need to reassess the discourse around 
sexual assault. We need to focus our efforts 
on preventing sexual violence. And for victims 
of sexual assault, nations need to develop 
and fund campaigns and organizations that 
emphasize that survivors cannot and should 
not be blamed.

We must change our systems in ways that 

don’t allow for victim blaming, and instead 
focus on prosecuting the perpetrators. We 
cannot blame the victim any longer. It will 
only isolate and create an environment where 
victims are scared to speak out and get support. 
Ending victim blaming starts with removing 
statements like these from our University 
surveys. This isn’t just a national issue 
perpetrated by lawmakers and law enforcers; 
this is an issue that must be addressed at local 
levels such as the University.

Ending victim blaming

ANNA POLUMBO-LEVY | VIEWPOINT

V

irginity is often something we’re 
ashamed of and want to get rid of, 
or something we want to hold onto 

until marriage so that we 
maintain “purity.”

In the eyes of many peo-

ple, the first time one has sex 
with another person is a sig-
nificant occasion. Everyone 
has different notions as to 
why it’s a big deal, but there’s 
one thing I have found held 
in common–after it happens, 
the big deal is pretty much 
over. The build-up is such a 
big deal that the actual act is 
almost inconsequential.

Originally this notion of “virginity” came 

from the idea that once an unmarried woman 
has intercourse with a 
man, she is tainted with 
sin and no longer pure 
for her beloved husband. 
She is ruined for mar-
riage if she has engaged 
in intercourse before she 
 

is wed.

These days, there’s often 

a pressure to have sex for 
the first time at a young age. 
If you haven’t, you are con-
sidered inexperienced, and there’s an assump-
tion that you must be undesirable. Since ideas 
of “purity” no longer have such a strong hold 
in many communities, there should be no rea-
son that one hasn’t had sex by their late teens. 
Even while writing this article I feel compelled 
to make clear that I’m not writing this article 
because I am a “virgin,” because I don’t want 
you to get the wrong idea. I don’t want you to 
think I’m undesirable or inexperienced.

Virginity is based around shame — either 

shame that you still have it, or shame that you 

“lost” it.

But what the heck even is virginity? Is 

it simply when a penis enters a vagina? An 
orgasm certainly isn’t in the definition, is it? 
When do men who only have sex with men 
“lose their virginity?” Do we re-define vir-
ginity as when a penis is stuck inside a hole? 
Is it all about the penis entering an orifice? So 
then when do women who only have sex with 
women lose their virginity? When is “virgin-
ity” lost when no penis is involved? Does a 
woman have to have something stuck inside 
of her to “lose her virginity?”

Based on these basic concepts, it seems like 

“virginity” is all about the penis.

Virginity is about shame, the male orgasm 

and heterosexual sex.

This is a call for vocabulary change. Per-

haps we should say I had sex for the first 

time rather than “I lost 
my virginity.” Where did 
you lose it? Should we go 
 

find it?

Women, we should cel-

ebrate having orgasms for 
the first time, rather than 
the first time we have a 
foreign object stuck in 
our bodies. We should 
celebrate sex rather than 
ridding ourselves of vir-

ginity. We should celebrate the act of making 
one another feel good rather than the concept 
of who took what from whom. Having sex for 
the first time can be treated as a less weighted 
experience, while one’s first orgasm is the 
real celebration. Let’s lose “virginity” as a 
concept. No one should be labeled by his or 
her experience levels, but rather by his or her 
desire to love.

Energy policies protect health 

TO THE DAILY: 

A week and a half ago, the Michigan 

Public Service Commission released a report 
concerning the state’s progress of Public 
Act 295, issued in 2008. This Act requires 
that by the end of 2015, the state’s electric 
providers get 10 percent of their energy from 
renewable sources. According to the report, 
Michigan’s renewable energy output is at 8.1 
percent, and MPSC seems very optimistic 
that the goal of 10 percent will be met by the 
end of this year.

But, we shouldn’t stop there. The act 

terminates at the end of this year, and 
rather than abandoning the efforts already 

in place, we should build off of the growing 
momentum. By increasing Michigan’s use of 
renewable energy, an incredible amount of 
health benefits could follow in its wake. As 
of now, Michigan ranks fifth in the nation in 
premature deaths, hospital admissions and 
heart attacks attributed to coal-fired power 
plant pollution. We can, and must, do better 
than this.

By demanding cleaner energy and tapping 

into Michigan’s solar and wind power 
potential, we will reduce these pollutant-
induced diseases. Energy policy, after all, 
can protect our health.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
 
 
 
 

B

efore I begin, I just want to 
say that one of the things 
I value as a columnist for 

The 
Michigan 

Daily is that I can 
explore a wide 
variety of topics 
and speak frankly 
and 
honestly 

through my own 
experiences. I’ve 
written columns 
about 
language 

barriers, racism, 
femininity, 
religious 
minorities, among others, and I 
appreciate that The Michigan Daily 
allows me to do so. For this reason, 
I, too, really cherish the idea of 
having other people write from 
their own unique perspectives.

I read a recent column titled 

“Relative Wealth,” and there were 
parts of it that I found illuminat-
ing and fascinating — the cultural 
differences between the Bay Area 
and Ann Arbor, for example. Like-
wise, I sympathized with Klein’s 
sense that her views on money dif-
fer from other Michigan students. 
However, I also want to bring in my 
own perspectives — the part that 
differs from Klein’s. I am among 
the minority whose family does not 
earn $100,000 or more a year. I am 
also an Ann Arbor native.

Before she got laid off, my mother 

was earning about $30,000 a year. 
She is currently making an incon-
sistent $900 a month, without ben-
efits. I’m not saying this to incite 
pity, but to give a sense of where 
exactly I’m coming from. I consider 
myself extremely lucky, not only 
because I am attending this school, 
but also because I have been able 
to receive financial aid and schol-
arships to be here. Without this 
kind of money, I would not have the 
option of living close to campus (as 
opposed to commuting from home 
via bus). I would not have the option 

of taking the kind of classes I want 
to take. And I would not have the 
option of considering a computer 
science double major (not surpris-
ingly, the tuition for an LSA com-
puter science major is that of the 
Engineering school, about $1,500 
more per semester than any other 
LSA major).

And that, I think, is my main 

point: how money gives people 
options. It sounds like such a cliché, 
but the thing to remember is that 
clichés originate from an experi-
ence that is true, regardless of how 
many times they are uttered.

Even if there are cultural dif-

ferences between spending habits 
in California and Michigan, what 
remains true is that the wealthy 
in each state still have the option 
of buying whatever it is they want. 
Yes, it’s fascinating that people in 
California would much rather trav-
el or collect experiences than buy 
clothes, but it 
seems to me that 
these 
Califor-

nians still have 
the 
option 
of 

buying 
expen-

sive clothes if 
they 
wanted. 

And for town-
ies, 
it 
might 

be 
true 
that 

we care more 
about 
fashion, 

but what remains valid is that the 
wealthy among us can still book a 
plane ticket to Europe whenever 
they want. Both options are still 
readily there.

I think it’s important to keep 

in mind that there’s a difference 
between having a family who needs 
to save some money here and there 
to afford an out-of-state school, and 
having a family who knows that 
the out-of-state institutions are not 
even up for consideration. I think 
it’s important to consider the dif-
ferences between paying for a pric-

ey drink and not having the money 
to even buy drinks in the first place 
because most of that spending 
money is going towards necessi-
ties. These, in my opinion, are the 
kinds of comparisons we should be 
looking at more closely, the kinds of 
comparisons that we should work 
to eliminate in our society.

Until I wrote this piece, I have 

very purposefully steered clear of 
discussing my low socioeconom-
ic status. I have, since coming to 
Michigan, come to embrace my sta-
tus as a woman, as a person of color, 
etc. But I have never felt that I could 
fit in with my peers because of my 
SES. It’s a part of me that makes 
me feel, in a strange way, ashamed. 
I will not forget the day my moth-
er opened the mail and found an 
anonymous check of $200 to help 
us pay for the bills; she broke down 
in front of me in shame, and I felt 
completely worthless because there 

was 
nothing 

else we could 
do — we had no 
other option of 
paying for our 
utilities than to 
accept this gen-
erous donation.

So given that 

students 
like 

me don’t feel we 
have a proper 
place 
in 
this 

school, the most important thing 
we can do is help each other find 
a way we belong. We want to find 
each other; we want to reach out to 
each other; we want to know that 
our presence here is not a burden. 
While I still appreciate the new 
perspective “Relative Wealth” pro-
vided, I think some of what it did to 
students like me is remind us of just 
how little we relatively have, of just 
how few of us there might be.

A response to “Relative wealth”

JENNY
WANG

That, I think, is my 

main point: how 

money gives people 

options. 


By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Dan Dakich had a play drawn 

up. Down two points in the 
final seconds of regulation, he 
was trying to squeeze the last 
ounces of productivity out of an 
exhausted crew of 17-year-olds, 
and he knew he had to go for the 
win.

So out came the clipboard, and 

the former head coach at Bowling 
Green and Indiana let his team, an 
AAU squad known as the Indiana 
Elite, know what was going to 
happen. They’d isolate Mark 
Donnal, now a redshirt freshman 
forward for the Michigan men’s 
basketball team, in the corner and 
give him the chance to win the 
game with a 3-pointer.

Everybody 
was 
on 
board 

except for Dakich’s son, Andrew. 
He told his father the obvious — 
they needed just two points to tie, 
not three.

The elder Dakich, now a 

college 
basketball 
analyst 
at 

ESPN, 
recalled 
the 
ensuing 

interaction like it was yesterday: 
“Every single guy in the huddle 
turned and said, ‘Andrew, shut 
the hell up!’ ”

Donnal, Dakich’s teammate at 

Michigan, drained the 3-pointer. 
Andrew, now a sophomore guard 
for the Wolverines, laughed as he 
and his teammates celebrated the 
buzzer-beater win.

“He was always talking,” Dan 

Dakich said. “I used to have to 
tell him, ‘sit the hell down and let 
me coach the team,’ even though 
he always had an opinion that I 
privately thought was great.”

Regardless of whether he’s 

playing in an AAU or a college 
game, the younger Dakich has 
never been shy about expressing 
his opinions on the court or from 
the sidelines. His father has a 
picture of a young Andrew, no 
more than nine or 10 years old, on 
his mantle at home — he’s holding 
a clipboard and dry-erase marker, 
smiling as he draws up a play for 
his teammates.

Dakich also hasn’t been shy 

about his long-term interest in 
a coaching career. It’s one of the 
main reasons he chose to walk 
on for the Wolverines instead 
of accepting a scholarship at a 
Division II school.

“Coach Beilein is a guy that 

I’ve always admired, and I think 
I want to get into coaching 
afterward,” he said. “There’s no 
better way than to be in a system 
like his and learn from him.”

Coming to Ann Arbor wasn’t 

without its downsides, though. 
Dakich knew full well that joining 
a team fresh off a Final Four 
appearance as a walk-on would 
make getting minutes far more 
difficult than it would have been 
at a Division II school or a less 
competitive Division I program.

All the same, one would 

expect 
Dakich’s 
transition 

from a starting role and scoring 
average of 14.1 points at Zionsville 
(Indiana) to his role as a reserve 
with extremely limited minutes 
at Michigan to have been difficult. 
That’s not the 
case, according 
to 
the 
men 

who have spent 
more 
time 

than 
anyone 

else 
coaching 

him: his father 
and Zionsville 
coach 
Shaun 

Busick.

“Andrew Dakich is a very 

selfless young man,” Busick said. 
“He had no illusions about what 
he was getting into. The fact 
that he turned down Division 
II scholarship offers to come to 
Michigan shows that he really, 
really, really wants to play, and he 
loves the game.”

Still, Dakich found himself at 

the end of the bench during his 
freshman season with an unusual 
amount of time on his hands 
during games. Accustomed to 
being on the court constantly at 
Zionsville, he needed to find a 
way to contribute. The solution 
was the Bench Mob, a Dakich-led 
crew of reserves who expressed 
their satisfaction with Michigan’s 
play on the court in an unusual 
and unimaginably enthusiastic 
manner.

Dakich 
even 
inspired 
a 

YouTube montage of his sideline 
dance 
moves, 
entitled 
“UM 

Hoops: Bench Mob Revolution,” 
that has over 18,000 views. He has 

a knack for predicting the future, 
too — many of the clips show him 
leaping from his seat on the bench 
to celebrate a made basket, never 
mind the ball not even having left 
the shooter’s hands.

“That all started at Michigan,” 

Dan Dakich said. “He was always 
in the game (at Zionsville). He’s 
just an enthusiastic kid. If kids 
called him up in the neighborhood 
and they were going to play 
baseball down the street, he ran. 
He was the first one there.”

Andrew Dakich has plenty of 

examples to draw from for his 
creativity. Apart from having 
spent his youth watching his 
father coach basketball — even 
apart from Beilein — Dakich has 
a number of coaching role models 
at Michigan. Assistant coaches 
Bacari Alexander, Jeff Meyer 
and 
LaVall 
Jordan 
regularly 

advise him not just as an aspiring 
basketball player, but as an 
aspiring coach.

Alexander, Dakich said, is the 

coach with whom he speaks the 
most about his aspirations in the 
field. There’s plenty to say and 
even more to show — beyond his 
coaching 
prowess, 
Alexander 

is known for off-court antics 
that leave his players with no 
other option than to absorb his 
message.

In 2013, Alexander famously 

took a stack of Pringles and placed 
a single potato chip on each of his 
players’ shoulders, instructing 
them to — wait for it — “play with 
a chip on their shoulder” in their 
upcoming game against Ohio 
State.

“When 
you’re 
a 
coach, 

regardless of the sport, it’s 
important to use different types 
of 
analogies 
and 
metaphors 

to 
engage 
student-athletes,” 

Alexander said. “As humorous 
or creative as a pregame speech 
might be, it also serves as a 
mechanism 
to 
get 
guys 
to 

encapsulate a message that goes 
way beyond antics.”

To Alexander, it’s obvious that 

Dakich encapsulates whatever 
message 
his 
coaches 
and 

teammates leave him with.

Dakich’s communication skills, 

poise and basketball knowledge 
also made an early impression on 
Busick when the family moved to 
Zionsville prior to his freshman 
year.

“He moved here the summer 

before his freshman year, I 
believe, and I could tell then that 
he had a great knowledge of the 
game,” Busick said. “And I give 
my point guards a lot of freedom 
to talk to me about things, to give 
me suggestions. Andrew would 
always have something good.”

Dakich said he has always 

viewed his position as a sort of 
floor general, a traffic director 
who distributes and stays away 
from a scoring-first mentality.

“My role is to get people open, 

get open shots for other people 
and be a coach on the floor,” 
Dakich said. “That’s kind of 
always been my role, growing up, 
so I think that I just add another 
vocal piece to the game.”

Clearly, 

though, 
that 

role 
extends 

beyond 
his 

actual on-court 
minutes, which 
were far and 
few 
between 

until recently.

Dakich’s 

plan 
entering 

his sophomore year was to sit out 
the season as a redshirt. It made 
sense — he hadn’t played much 
his freshman year, and taking 
advantage of an opportunity 
to play a fifth year in a less 
competitive conference was a 
no-brainer.

But the circumstances have 

changed in a big way since the 
preseason — to say the least, 
Michigan’s 2014-15 season hasn’t 
gone the way its players and 
coaches had initially hoped.

Coming off an Elite Eight 

appearance, 
the 
Wolverines 

began the year ranked No. 24 and 
had high expectations despite 
having lost three players — Nik 
Stauskas, Glenn Robinson III and 
Mitch McGary — to the NBA.

Those hopes took a tumble 

when Michigan sustained early-
season losses to the New Jersey 
Institute 
of 
Technology 
and 

Eastern Michigan, and they went 
into a full-on nosedive when the 
Wolverines lost junior guard 

Caris LeVert and later sophomore 
guard Derrick Walton Jr., to a foot 
injuries.

Michigan’s 
suddenly 
short 

rotation gave Dakich an obvious 
opportunity to burn the redshirt, 
something he had wanted to 
do for weeks, even before the 
injuries to two of the Wolverines’ 
most important players.

“My plan, ever since I got here, 

was to play for the University 
of Michigan,” Dakich said. “I 
talked to Coach Beilein and 
Coach (Alexander) right after 
the Northwestern game, after we 
heard the news about Caris, and 
they were asking me if I was sure 
I wanted to do this. I said I was 
100 percent in, whatever way to 
help the team.

“To be honest, I just thought 

the fifth year would help me 
either possibly play here, or 
possibly somewhere else. My 
goal is not to leave the University 
of Michigan. My goal is to play 
here. If I can play here for the 
fifth year, fine, if I can’t, then 
I’ll maybe figure something out, 
go somewhere else for another 
year.”If playing a fifth year is still 

Dakich’s goal, using his junior 
year to redshirt would be the 
logical option. As of now, though, 
there’s no plan either way.

“That’s going to be up in the 

air,” Dakich said. “I don’t know 
the answer to that right now.”

Dakich’s on-court presence 

did beg an important question, 
now that he’s playing meaningful 
minutes: who would run the 
Bench Mob with its leader 
preoccupied 
with 
playing 

basketball?

“That’s 
a 
good 
question,” 

Dakich said. “I think we all kind 
of get hype for each other. We all 
play off one another.”

It 
took 
him 
six 
game 

appearances to score his first 
points of the season, a 3-pointer 
from the corner in Michigan’s 
64-57 upset of Ohio State on Feb. 
22.

“I was just relieved,” Dakich 

said. “I haven’t been playing the 
way I think I can, sometimes, 
and to finally hit that first shot — 
I couldn’t stop smiling, because 
I’ve waited for this moment my 
whole life, and to do it against 
a really good Ohio State team is 

pretty cool.”

Beilein, 
Busick 
and 
Dan 

Dakich were all thrilled to see 
the shot find net, but as basketball 
coaches, they shared a common 
complaint.

“I’m gonna give him the 

business,” Beilein said after the 
game, “because he made a 3 and 
then … we gave up a 3 at the other 
end. There was two or three steps 
of celebration, and maybe relief, 
that maybe (could be) attributed 
to that. If it didn’t, I’ll make it 
attributed to that.”

Though Dakich now has an 

opportunity to build off his 
increased playing opportunities, 
there’s still a bottom line for 
Michigan that hasn’t been met. 
The Wolverines have lost five 
of their last six games and are 
struggling in their question for a 
postseason bid.

The silver lining, according 

to Alexander and Dan Dakich, is 
that this year demonstrates many 
coaching adages more clearly 
than any spoken piece of advice 
ever could.

“It’s just one of those things,” 

Dan Dakich said. “When you have 

success, enjoy the hell out of it.”

Alexander said that Dakich has 

had the opportunity to observe 
a “solution-oriented” coaching 
staff. It’s a good experience, 
Alexander said, for Dakich to 
witness his coaches using a 
“growth mindset” in dealing 
with a problem that all coaches 
face at one point or another: an 
underclassman-laden team that 
at the end of the day is simply 
lacking savvy and experience in 
big-time college basketball.

With 
Michigan’s 
players 

having suffered more heartbreak 
losses this season than they 
care to remember, there are 
opportunities aplenty for Dakich 
to offer his teammates pearls of 
wisdom.

From the sound of it, he won’t 

have any trouble getting hired.

“He’ll be a more patient coach 

than I ever was,” Dan Dakich 
said.

Patience 
or 
not, 
Dakich 

won’t have to wait long to land a 
coaching gig. But with Beilein, 
Busick and his father as role 
models, he knows he’ll be held to 
the highest of standards.

Andrew Dakich: The ‘coach on the floor’

JAMES COLLER/Daily

Sophomore Andrew Dakich is perhaps the most enthusiastic member of the Michigan men’s basketball team, a trait he hopes to one day take into coaching.

“He’ll be a more 

patient coach 

than I ever was.”

JC transfer Cody Bruder 
now thriving at Michigan

Junior off to 

hot start for ‘M’ 
after two years in 

junior college

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

Being a newcomer is often 

intimidating, as many college 
students know. 

Junior 
left 
fielder 
Cody 

Bruder is no exception. This 
is his first season with the 
Michigan baseball team — he 
spent his first two years at 
Orange Coast College.

“Being the new kid on the 

block you always have some 
hesitation,” Bruder said, “and 
you kind of have to prove 
yourself right away.” 

Bruder’s 
impact 
on 
the 

Wolverines is already showing. 
On Feb. 20 against Tennessee 
Tech, he went 3-for-4 with 
a game-tying RBI triple in 
the 
eighth 

inning and a 
go-ahead bunt 
single in the 
ninth 
inning 

of Michigan’s 
5-4 victory. 

“These guys 

get hyped for 
things 
like 

that,” Bruder 
said 
of 
his 

teammates’ reaction to his late-
inning heroics. “They made me 
feel right at home like any great 
family would.” 

* * * 

Bruder is no novice to the 

game of baseball. He started 
playing at the age of four, as he 
looked up to his sister Kelsey 
and his mother Raleen. His 
mother 
played 
softball 
for 

Weber State from 1980 to 1982, 
and Kelsey played softball for 
Florida from 2008 to 2011 before 
turning professional. 

“(Kelsey) 
is 
the 
hardest 

worker I know, so I try to model 
myself after her,” Bruder said. 
“We got along way too well for 
siblings, always rooting for each 
other.” 

Bruder had similar praise for 

his mother. 

“Definitely 
one 
of 
the 

hardest-working women I’ve 
ever met,” Bruder said. “A single 
mother starting out with no 
job just raising Kelsey and me, 
and we didn’t know we were 
struggling at all, because she 
was out grinding.” 

He took the lessons he 

learned from his mother and 
sister to Santiago High School 
in Corona, California, where 
he graduated in 2012. He was 
named Offensive Player of the 
Year his senior season. 

Yet in spite of the praise 

Bruder received in high school 
and the fact that he was named 
one of ESPN’s top prospects in 
2011, he remains modest about 
his time at Santiago. 

“To be completely honest,” 

Bruder said, “I wasn’t that great 
in high school at all.” 

***

Bruder’s 
next 
step 
was 

attending Orange Coast College. 
While attending a junior college 
is not a path often taken by 

someone who 
compiled 
a 

4.1 GPA his 
senior year of 
high 
school, 

he credits the 
coaching staff 
there 
with 

revamping 
his swing and 
improving his 
fielding. 

“Going to a junior college 

might have been the best thing 
that ever happened to me,” 
Bruder said. “Those coaches 
were wizards and made me 
the player I am today. Between 
there and (Michigan), I have 
had amazing coaches and I owe 
my success to all of them.” 

The lessons paid off. In 2013, 

Bruder’s freshman year, he 
netted a .336 batting average 
with six doubles, three triples 
and 28 RBI. The next year was 
even more fruitful for Bruder, as 
he batted .359 with 10 doubles, 
eight triples, four home runs 
and 31 RBI while leading Orange 
Coast to a No. 1 ranking among 
California junior colleges. 

“(The 2014 team) was the 

greatest team I’ve been on 
before this year,” Bruder said. 
“To get a collection of athletes 
like that at a junior college in 
California was pretty special.” 

While the Wolverines aren’t 

known for recruiting junior 
college 
players, 
Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich knew right 
away that he found a winner in 
Bruder. 

“He’s had a lot of repetitions 

being a California junior college 
player,” Bakich said. “We knew 
we wanted someone who would 
have the opportunity to step in 
and contribute right away. The 
best is yet to come.”

On the academic side, Bruder 

majored in zoology at Orange 
Coast and is currently studying 
evolutionary anthropology at 
Michigan. He plans to go to 
graduate school and devote 
his life to saving endangered 
species. 

“AP Environmental Science 

my junior year of high school 
really 
opened 
my 
eyes 
to 

environmental 
issues 
and 

species endangerment around 
the world,” Bruder said. 

But it would be misleading 

to say Bruder is all business. 
He is a big fan of Nickelodeon’s 
TV 
show 
“Spongebob 

Squarepants,” an avid Yu-Gi-
Oh! card player and a Pokemon 
enthusiast. 

“I play (Yu-Gi-Oh!) with 

my friends and go to local 
tournaments,” Bruder said. “It’s 
people’s livelihoods. There are 
cards out there selling for $80 
each.” 

Yet his favorite way to relieve 

tension is to play Call of Duty: 
Modern Warfare 2. 

“Sometimes you just have to 

take out aggression,” Bruder 
said. “What better way to do 
that than Call of Duty?” 

Bruder’s fun-loving attitude 

seems to be shared among his 
teammates, and Bakich is a 
significant contributor to the 
weirdness of the team. 

“This is the weirdest bunch 

I’ve been a part of,” Bruder said. 
“You just got a collection of 
different people in one unison 
creating a cool, weird vibe. 
We feed off of coach Bakich’s 
intensity. He’s a colorful human 
being.” 

Cody 
Bruder 
may 
be 
a 

newcomer to the Wolverines, 
but with the impact he has had 
on the team, it’s as if he was 
always there.

“To be completely 
honest, I wasn’t 
that great in high 

school at all.”

Sophomore third baseman Lindsay Montemarano has heated up after a slow start to the season.
Montemarano ignites lineup

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Sophomore infielder Lindsay 

Montemarano 
was 
holding 

herself to a high standard coming 
into this season.

“Everyone worked really hard 

in the summer to come back 
strong,” 
Montemarano 
said. 

“I felt like this summer I had 
a mindset where I wanted to 
come back (as a sophomore), and 
I wanted to step up and show 
everybody what I was capable 
of.”

Yet nine games into the 

Michigan softball team’s season, 
Montemarano had not recorded a 
single hit, starting 0-for-14.

She 
explained 
that 
she 

struggled early in the season 
because she had such a strong 
desire to play well. Montemarano 
knew what she was capable of but 
was struggling to execute on the 
field. This led to a decline in her 
confidence in the batter’s box and 
lent itself to a mental issue in her 
game.

But Montemarano didn’t just 

feel sorry for herself. Rather, she 
did something about it.

According to Michigan coach 

Carol Hutchins, Montemarano 
was putting in extra work before 
the Easton Bama Bash this past 

weekend.

Hutchins 
explained 
that 

senior catcher Lauren Sweet 
misses the majority of practice 
on Tuesdays, so the two of them 
typically run through hitting 
drills afterward. But that week, 
they had a welcome addition: 
Montemarano.

If that wasn’t enough, the 

sophomore infielder was back at 
it Wednesday morning, perusing 
film with coaches and searching 
for technical flaws in her swing. 
And 
eventually, 
they 
found 

something.

“My front foot,” Montemarano 

said. “When I was putting it back 
to start my swing, my front toe 
was coming up and I was getting 
onto my heels. So I had no power, 
and I was completely spinning off 
the ball. It was a pretty easy fix, it 
wasn’t my whole swing.”

And 
that 
“easy 
fix” 
did 

wonders. 
Montemarano 
went 

6-for-14 
on 
the 
weekend. 

Fittingly, in the final game of the 
weekend against James Madison, 
Montemarano stepped up to the 
plate in the second inning and 
sent the ball flying over the left-
field fence.

“She was due,” Hutchins said. 

“Mentally, her game improved 
and therefore the rest of her 
game improved.”

In their season-opening series, 

the Wolverines scored 18 runs 
and did not record a single run-
rule victory.

But heading into the Easton 

Bama Bash, Montemarano was 
the only blemish in a Michigan 
lineup that was excelling at the 
plate. At that point, Michigan had 
scored 36 more runs and recorded 
three run-rule victories.

After Montemarano’s breakout 

performance against Lipscomb 
this past weekend, Michigan 
rolled onward to five victories, 
posting 42 runs in the process.

At this point, the Wolverines’ 

lineup has eight players who have 
hit at least one home run. In a 
lineup with only one slap hitter, 
there is plenty of power.

“Hitting 
is 
contagious 

sometimes,” said junior shortstop 
Sierra Romero. “So as soon as 
someone starts going, all of a 
sudden everyone starts going. 
Our bats are on fire right now, 
so we’re just hoping that that 
continues into spring break.”

So when Montemarano finally 

found her swing, Michigan’s 
lineup became all the more 
dangerous. In that nine-game 
cold streak, she struggled with 
consistency. 
But 
now, 
she’s 

just another one of the nine 
Wolverines to be reckoned with.

Daily Arts Writer

What’s a teen to do on a Friday 

night? In Ann Arbor, countless 
music venues open their doors and 
host fantastic shows of all differ-
ent genres, but almost every loca-
tion has an age limit. Fortunately, 
for those under 18 who want to get 
involved in the Ann Arbor music 
scene, there is the B-Side, the only 
music venue run by and for teens.

The B-Side is the music arm of 

the Neutral Zone — Ann Arbor’s 
nonprofit teen center entering its 
15th year. The Neutral Zone start-
ed hosting concerts for youths of all 
ages in 1999 when teens proposed 
hosting fundraising concerts on 
Friday nights. The Neutral Zone 
made a makeshift stage to host 
the acts in their location on Main 
Street, but when it decided to move 
in 2006, the new facility on East 
Washington was established with a 
separate in-house concert hall spe-
cifically for B-Side acts.

The Neutral Zone itself is Ann 

Arbor’s space for teens to grow 
through community leadership 
and artistic expression. Programs 
are offered in music, literary arts, 
visual arts and leadership, allow-
ing teens a wide variety of options 
to choose from. The Zone also pro-
vides educational opportunities 
for teens such as assistance with 
college admissions and tutoring by 
volunteering University students.

The Neutral Zone is open 

from 2:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. Monday 
through Thursday and 2:30 p.m. 
to 6 p.m. on Friday to make space 
for B-Side shows. These hours 
allow teens to come and go to and 

within the space as they please, 
choosing which programs they 
would like to participate in. There 
is a program fee for teens who 
choose to participate in the arts-
based programs, but scholarships 
are available and no teen is ever 
turned away. As long as students 
are of high school age, they are 
free to partake in the welcoming 
community of the Neutral Zone.

The physical space of the B-Side 

feels like an underground club with 
paintings on every wall. When fac-
ing the stage, the eye is immedi-
ately drawn to the left-side wall, 
which depicts a mural honoring 
Disco D, a producer and composer 
from Ann Arbor who passed away 
in 2007. Neutral Zone students and 
alumni do all the artwork, which 
varies greatly in style and scheme.

Jamall Bufford, the Neutral 

Zone music coordinator, has been 
with the B-Side since its incep-
tion, both as a performer and now 
as staff.

Bufford, a rapper in his own 

right, had been pursuing his music 
career touring in Europe and Aus-
tralia, but returned to his native 
Ann Arbor four years ago searching 
for his next move. A friend pointed 
him toward his old performance 
space at the Neutral Zone, sug-
gesting he help out with the emcee 
workshop. Then, two years ago, he 
became the music coordinator of 
all the teen music programs, which 
include beatmaking, DJing, live 
sound engineering, recording stu-
dio, record-label operation, emcee-
ing and, of course, the B-Side.

“My job is to just essentially 

coordinate the teen’s visions and 
help them see it through,” Bufford 
said. “This is a youth-driven space 
so whatever their vision is we try 
to help them make it happen. They 
dictate how the program is run. For 
the B-Side they book the shows, 
they actually work the shows, they 
take the door money, they work the 
concession stands and they stage-
manage. They also help handle the 
money at the end of the show and 
they pay the Neutral Zone for staff-
ing and pay the bands. It’s giving 
them first-hand experience on how 
to manage a concert venue.”

B-Side meetings, where the real 

work gets done, are casual and free-
form. More like a group of good 
friends hanging out and talking 
about music than a planning com-
mittee, teens are free to come and 
go as they please. No one person is 
in charge and everyone is free to 
input their opinion on the project 
at hand. Bufford is only there to 
maintain order and guide the con-
versation, while the teens produce 

the bulk of the planning ideas.

Halfway through a meeting I 

sat in, a Zone volunteer giving a 
prospective member a tour of the 
space came in. The B-Side teens 
were welcoming and enthusias-
tic, praising their coordinator and 
explaining their respective work-
groups. Upon hearing the prospec-
tive teen play drums, three of the 
B-Siders immediately offered him 
a spot in their band.

Each of the B-Side concerts, 

which are usually held every 
Friday, cost around $5 and are 
booked and promoted by the teens 
that participate in the B-Side 
workshop. The seven-to-ten teens 
find bands to host, promote the 
show with flyers and online, and 
staff the concert.

“(The teens) choose what they 

want to do here at the Neutral 

Zone, nothing is mandatory, it’s 
not like school. It’s just their own 
intrinsic want to be here, to be a 
part of something cool, something 
fun,” Bufford said. “They kind of 
gravitate toward what they like. 
We try to plan shows almost every 
week if we can, which is pretty 
involved especially if you’re a high 
school teen. So the fact that they 
come here every week and try to 
put together a nice show is amaz-

ing to me because they don’t have 
to do it.”

Ben Schaaf, a current sopho-

more at Rudolf Steiner High School 
in Ann Arbor, became a Zone 
member after playing a show at the 
B-Side.

“I had played a fundraiser for 

a child who went to Steiner who 
needed a bone marrow transplant,” 
Schaaf said. “My band played the 
fundraiser there in eighth grade 
and I got inspired to come join the 
B-Side through some friends I met 
there who had been in it for some 
time.”

The bands that play the B-Side 

can be chosen through a variety of 
ways. They can submit their music 
for review, come pitch a show at a 
B-Side meeting, or are selected by 
the teen fans themselves.

The B-Side hosts special shows 

every first Friday of the month, 
showcasing new talent including 
not just music, but also poetry and 
art. The first 25 people in the door 
on those nights get in free. The 
most recent First Friday featured 
Ann Arbor bands the Euphorics, 
Caves and Creal. Caves pianist 
Summer Krinsky, a University 
alum, said the band was booked 
through their friend and fellow 
locals the Euphorics, many of 
whom had members involved in 
the B-Side throughout their high 
school years.

“Since the B-Side is community-

funded, it has an amazing setup and 
happens to be one of the best spaces 
we have ever played in Ann Arbor,” 
Krinsky said. “The B-Side definite-
ly has one of the best sounding rigs 
and rooms and a great crew work-
ing there. It is absolutely an under-
appreciated venue and I hope that 
college bands play there more fre-
quently with high school bands to 
bridge the two music scenes that 
are both very much thriving in Ann 
Arbor.”

Krinsky did mention, however, 

that it is often hard to encour-
age college student attendance of 
B-Side shows because, as a teen 
venue, there is no alcohol allowed 
on the premises and shows must 
end by 11 p.m. However, this did 
not seem to impact the crowd on 
the night of Feb. 9, as the large 
room dedicated to B-Side shows 
was packed with teens of all ages 
chatting and dancing to the music.

One large-scale event that some 

of the B-Side teens assist in plan-
ning every year is a festival called 
Live on Washington, held out-
side in the summer. Washington 
Street in front of the Neutral Zone 
is blocked off and a large stage is 
erected. There is also a smaller 
stage for acoustic acts that runs 
in the Comerica parking lot next 
door. During the day are teen acts 
of all different genres leading up 
to a larger headliner. The last two 
years featured Shigeto and Mayer 
Hawthorne in addition to a variety 
of fantastic teen acts.

Ali Shahin, a senior at Skyline 

High School in Ann Arbor, partici-
pates in both the B-Side and Live 

on Washington.

“I started here at the B-Side 

around Fall 2013,” Shahin said. 
“My friends were in a really pop-
ular music group here, Creal, 
and they were performing a free 
show here. The first time I came I 
thought it was super awesome that 
teens were doing all this so I stuck 
around.”

Two years later, Shahin is now 

a teen facilitator and is currently 
organizing 
SOAR, 
Speak 
Out 

Against Rape, which will be held in 
the B-Side venue in March.

“What I love about the B-Side 

is the youth-driven approach to 
both finding talent, putting talent 
on stage, making sure everything 
goes smoothly, making sure we’re 
professional; and its all driven by 
young people who are passionate 
about music,” Shahin said.

The B-Side provides a space in 

Ann Arbor for teens to be them-
selves and spend time on their 
own terms. Coordinator Bufford 
believes the musical aspect of the 
program provides an easy gateway 
to the rest of the activities offered 
by the Neutral Zone.

“Music has a way of touching a 

lot of people, and so if we can use 
music to get people in the door 
here, maybe they might discover 
they like something else,” Buf-
ford said. “This is a place they 
can express themselves and then 
find other people who have simi-
lar interests so that they don’t feel 
alone. Whether they feel like what 
they do is weird, or their parents 
might not support them rapping or 
them being in a punk metal band, 
or they may not support the type of 
art they draw, but then they come 
here and they say, ‘Hey you do the 
same thing, well that’s cool.’ So 
they feel like they have that kind of 
support system and they feel com-
fortable here and it’s a safe space.”

Meester all grown up

By GIBSON JOHNS

Daily Arts Writer

“Is Chace Crawford a good 

kisser?!”

Leighton Meester, of “Gos-

sip Girl” fame, was at The Magic 
Bag in Ferndale, Mich. to per-
form songs from her debut album, 
Heartstrings. She wasn’t there 
to be incessantly hounded with 
questions about her days play-
ing Blair Waldorf on a television 
show that ended three years ago. 
The question, which interrupted 
her demurely telling the audience 
about her tour, prompted Meester 
to stop mid-sentence, pause and 
then signal for her band to begin 
the next song.

And so the tone for the night 

was set by a handful of drunk post-
grads in the pit.

To be fair, the “Gossip Girl” 

references are to be expected 
at a Leighton Meester concert. 
Moments like this, unsurpris-
ingly, happened multiple times on 
Monday night. Blair Waldorf is 
“Gossip Girl” ’s most recognizable 
and beloved character — which is 
a statement that held true during 
the show’s heyday and still holds 
true today, as the Queen B of the 
Upper East Side’s legacy is upheld 
by her pervasiveness in meme cul-
ture and on Tumblr. But the audi-
ence’s incessant yelling about that 
era of her career quickly turned 
disrespectful, and it made the 
dynamic between Meester and the 
audience quite uncomfortable.

Regardless, throughout her 12 

song set, Meester’s vocals were 
clean, breezy and sometimes 
twangy. They proved that her foray 
into music represents more than 
just another bored actress with 
easy access to the industry mind-
lessly trying her hand at music. She 
has real talent, real perspective 
and real intentions. Her influenc-
es — Stevie Nicks, Joni Mitchell, 
Carly Simon — weren’t surpris-
ing, as it was clear that they’re the 
types of women she was striving to 
emulate both in tone and aesthetic.

Her and her band’s performance 

style was at once casual and seri-
ous, almost recalling a jam band 
performing for themselves in one 
of their parents’ garages. With a 
flannel shirt tied around her waist, 
Meester frequently took sips of 

coffee from a travel mug and often 
had her eyes closed when she was 
singing, seemingly forgetting for 
a moment that there was an audi-
ence of almost 300 watching her. 
She was in the zone.

The all-male five-piece band 

that backed her meshed well, and 
their presence proved comforting 
to Meester. (She may or may not 
have proclaimed that her “bass-
ist is bae.”) Most notably, her 
album’s producer, Jeff Trott, who 
was also behind some of Sheryl 
Crow’s earliest hits, was there 
and impressively jumped between 
instruments.

What may have held Meester 

back the most from truly connect-
ing, though, was simply the fact 
that the material from her debut 
left a bit to be desired. Other than 
a few standout tracks — “Heart-
strings,” “L.A.,” “Good for One 
Thing,” — they proved to be a bit 
one-note in a live setting, which 
made for especially forgettable 
moments when compared to the 
handful of strong, engaging covers 
she sprinkled throughout her set 
(Loretta Lynn’s “You Ain’t Woman 
Enough (To Take My Man),” The 
Cardigans’ “Lovefool” and Fleet-
wood Mac’s “Dreams” as the 
show’s rousing encore).

Considering the popularity and 

mainstream appeal of “Gossip 
Girl” and the oft-forgotten “Coun-
try Strong,” Leighton Meester’s 
other career choices have been a 
bit all over the place and generally 
unsatisfying. She was in the campy 
thriller “The Roommate,” the odd 

dramedy “The Oranges,” Adam 
Sandler’s “That’s My Boy,” Selena 
Gomezcs childish but fun “Monte 
Carlo” and a few other barely-seen 
films. Musically, her biggest hit 
has been her collaboration with 
Cobra Starship, “Good Girls Go 
Bad.” She has released a few folksy 
covers here and there, and she had 
an underrated song with Robin 
Thicke.

Point being, for all of the obvi-

ous talent that she has, Leighton 
Meester has shown little to no 
direction throughout her career. 
And I’m not sure where the Heart-
strings album and tour truly fit in. 
Perhaps it has been about not get-
ting the material right — a tour on 
which the covers she performs 
outshine the songs from the album 
it’s promoting, films that appear 
promising in trailers but end up 
disappointing. But, judging by her 
reaction to the crowd’s reaction, it’s 
also about her feeling stuck in the 
giant shadow that Blair Waldorf 
cast down on her from the steps of 
the Met.

She’s almost gotten it right again 

— and this tour is certainly a step in 
the right direction — but Leighton 
Meester still hasn’t come close to 
matching the peak of her “Gossip 
Girl” days. Maybe she doesn’t want 
to; maybe she just wants to create 
music that she enjoys and doesn’t 
care about the public’s — and “Gos-
sip Girl” fans’ — approval.

If that’s the case, then let’s just 

hope that she’s having fun doing 
so. And judging by her show on 
Monday, she’s at least doing that.

EPISODE REVIEW

This season, there hasn’t 

been another show that has 
broken out like “Empire.” 
The series is 
a monster in 
the 
ratings, 

growing 
each 

week since its 
premiere 
at 

the beginning 
of 
January. 

Despite its suc-
cess, the show 
is not perfect, and this episode 
exemplified both the drama’s 
high-points and flaws.

Most of “Empire” ’s successes 

stem from one performer: Taraji 
P. Henson (“Person of Interest”), 
who single-handedly carries 
this episode. She shows a wide 
range in her performance, from 
a more nuanced moment with 
her speech to company inves-
tors, to an angry moment when 
Elle (Courtney Love, “Sons of 
Anarchy”) appears high at the 
event. She brings all the differ-
ent sides of Cookie to life in a 
way that makes the show worth 

watching just for her character 
— in a way similar to watch-
ing Viola Davis on “How to Get 
Away with Murder.”

However, the episode doesn’t 

shy away from some of the more 
frustrating aspects of “Empire.” 
Lucius Lyon’s (Terrence How-
ard, “Iron Man”) health has 
been a consistent issue, as he 
decides to remain on a drug 
despite its potentially killing 
him. Even in the heightened 
reality of “Empire,” character 

choices like that don’t register 
as choices someone in real life 
would make.

If the show didn’t have 

some of these character issues, 
Henson and its wonderful music 
(last week’s hour featured a 
great performance by Jamal 
and Hakeem) would be enough 
to carry it. Unfortunately, some 
elements 
were 
frustrating 

enough that they hurt the 
episode.

SINGLE REVIEW

Who are you, Jack Garratt? 

The brother of the famed James 
Blake? Or cousin of Jamie Woon? 
Perhaps 
one 

of the two, as 
it seems you 
have similarly 
descended 
from the R&B 
electronic 
genre, 
one 

of the finest 
sonic creations of millennial 
musicians to date.

The mystical and domineer-

ing auditory forces that emerge 
from 
Garratt’s 
most 
recent 

single, “Chemical,” are over-
whelmingly enjoyable. It’s the 
combination of dilating beats, a 
chorus of rising alto voices and 
the 
emotionally 
entrenched, 

sweeping range of Garratt’s 
vocals that drag the listener into 
the track. The steady clap, clap, 
clap and low bass voices lure the 
listener in before crescendoing 
into a spastic chorus of electron-
ics that — while possessing the 
tenor to frighten a nearby dog — 
are delicious little Pop Rocks for 
the headphones. The calculated 

depth of Garratt’s “Chemical” 
ensures that even an obsessive 
listening session won’t prevent 
the discovery of some fascinat-
ing new rift, dip or sultry lyric.

Garratt, a 23-year-old Brit, 

has just begun to watch his 
career take flight. His 2014 EP, 
Remnants, sparked a seemingly 
never-ending European tour 
and only positive accolades 
from the critics. He’s insert-
ing himself into a niche of the 
music industry that Baths cre-
ated years ago, the melding of 
emotion to electronics. Har-

nessing the combined powers 
of the sound booth, its sound 
boards, sampling abilities and 
the human heart, the combi-
nation has found success over 
the past half decade. Garratt 
holds the talent to keep deep-
ening this musical divot, and 
he’s already attached three 
successful singles to his name: 
“Worry,” “Love You’re Given” 
and now “Chemical.” All this 
leaves the beckoning question: 
what’s going to happen when 
Jack drops an actual album?

Charitable giving is 
easier with Welzoo 

By MATTHEW BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

On the “About Us” section 

of Welzoo.com an image of Bill 
Gates appears with the corre-
sponding quote: “I choose a lazy 
person to do a hard job. Because 
a lazy person will find an easy 
way to do it.” Underneath lies 
the response of University alum 
and Welzoo co-founder Jona-
than Kaufman: “I am an incred-
ibly lazy person.”

Finding the easiest, simplest 

way to do something is at the 
center of Welzoo.com, a fun-
draising website founded by 
childhood 
friends 
Kaufman, 

University alum Artur Fruman 
and Michigan State University 
alum Zach Firestone. The Mich-
igan Daily was able to speak 
with Fruman, now in New York, 
over Skype, where he described 
the website’s concept.

“How it works is once any 

organization is listed on the 
site, any one of its members 
could choose that organization 
and sign up and make Welzoo.
com their browser homepage,” 
Fruman said. “Then every sin-
gle day they go online from then 
on we generate a 3-cent dona-
tion to the organization that 
they chose, everyday just for 
going on the Internet.”

According to Fruman, the 

trio of founders were all drawn 
to 
charity 
work, 
especially 

through Friendship Circle, a 
charity based in West Bloom-
field that helps children with 
special needs by incorporating 
a prototype indoor city.

“They had a fake bank, a 

pharmacy, a theater and pretty 
much you’d go there with who-
ever you’re partnered up with 
and they get to get this kind of 
practice round at life,” Fruman 
recalled.

However, as the friends 

grew up, they found it more 
difficult to donate time and 
money to charity. The three 
looked for ways to support the 
organizations they could no 
longer take an active role in 
by the finding simplest means 
possible.

“We wanted something that 

cost zero money and took zero 
time and throughout that brain-
storming process we were try-
ing to come up with things that 
we do every day that we could 
turn into something good,” 
Fruman said. “You know, we 
breathe everyday, we brush 
our teeth everyday and we also 
go on the Internet every single 
day.”

This idea became the concept 

of “PassiveAction”: “The idea of 
effortlessly putting our every-
day actions to use,” according 
to their website. And in today’s 
technology-driven 
world, 

what’s more everyday than the 
Internet? Picking up this con-
cept, the trio began to pursue 
the idea of Welzoo in 2012 and 

started the company in Ann 
Arbor.

“Ann Arbor was awesome; 

Ann Arbor was the best,” Fru-
man said. “We had an office in 
Ann Arbor. Right on top of Vil-
lage Apothecary we had a little 
office there; it was amazing.”

Originally aiming for larg-

er nonprofits, Fruman said a 
breakthrough came for the 
company when they became 
involved with student organi-
zations. He said the Univer-
sity’s South Asian Awareness 
Club, a student org., asked to 
list themselves on Welzoo to 
raise funds.

“We only wanted people to 

be able to support a nonprofit 
and 
student 
organizations 

were something we never even 
thought of targeting,” Fruman 
said.

“It was only a few months 

down the line where I realized 
that we were about to pay out 
some charities and I realized 
that this student org had raised 
a good amount of money,” 
Fruman said. “It was at that 
moment that I realized, what 
are we doing targeting chari-
ties and stuff when the whole 
basis for this whole company 
was because we as kids in col-
lege weren’t able to support our 
favorite organization? It was 
our age group that was miss-
ing out, that needed this type of 
platform.”

Welzoo pursued the involve-

ment of more student organi-
zations and continued to grow. 
Truman said that there are 
around 25 organizations that 
use Welzoo at the University 
alone. These range from frater-
nities and sororities to organi-
zations like More Than Me, a 
charity that helps young girls 
in Liberia go to school, and Stu-
dents for Diabetes Awareness.

When talking about Welzoo’s 

role in helping these organi-
zations, Fruman said the site 
exists to complement the efforts 
of these students.

“I think it all boils down to 

their passion to make a differ-
ence and that’s what all these 
student orgs seem to be doing,” 
Fruman said. “We’re happy to 
be a platform to help them out.”

Realizing the potential for 

Welzoo, 
Fruman, 
Kaufman 

and Firestone raised funds and 
moved the company to New 
York. However, the co-founders 
have aimed to keep their own 
light-hearted personalities in 
the project. Whether it’s pok-
ing fun at the apparent simplic-
ity or self-described “laziness” 
of the concept to pulling April 
Fool’s Day pranks on each other 
involving fake cease and desist 
letters, the team at Welzoo aims 
to enjoy their time.

Fruman 
described 
the 

dynamic between the three 
founders with Kaufman being 
the crazy, creative end; Fires-
tone being more calm and prop-
er; and Fruman himself lying 
somewhere in the middle, able 
to work with both of them.

When asked to think about a 

time when the three have com-
bined their talents to accom-
plish goals for the company, 
Fruman pointed to Welzoo’s 
most recent YouTube video, 
“Student Org Meeting — Wel-
zoo Discussion.” In the video, 
the three take a comic approach 
to a club leader discussing Wel-
zoo for the first time with his 
members.

“I was the one who kind of 

came up (with the idea) and 
made it happen,” Fruman said. 
“Zach was the one who came up 
with potentially what the lines 
would be. Jonathan comes in 
with the camera and his cre-
ative ideas saying, ‘That’s not 
cool enough, let’s go just true 
and raw and make it happen, 
we’ll make it creative.’ It all 
worked out.”

Welzoo’s interest in videos 

and social media has helped the 
company spread its message. 
Their first video, “The Mil-
lennial Rebuttal,” countered 
accusations about how today’s 
generation is out of touch and 
shows how young people have 
connected and advanced society 
using the Internet. The video 
has nearly 150,000 views. Wel-
zoo wishes to use social media 
in much the same way: to use 
social media as a means to raise 
charity. This includes their first 
fundraiser 
“#CutOutBreast-

Cancer,” which used Instagram 
to raise money, and raised $700 
dollars for the Breast Cancer 
Research Foundation.

Fruman 
remains 
humble 

when describing what he and 
his friends have achieved, but 
their ambitions remain high.

“We’re a pretty young com-

pany so I don’t want to say 
we’ve 
accomplished 
enough 

yet, but I’m definitely really 
happy with the route that it’s 
going right now,” Fruman said. 
“We’ve raised almost $50,000 
for various student organiza-
tions and nonprofits through-
out America. It’s not a crazy 
number at all, we want that to 
be tenfold that number within a 
year from now.”

But it’s still not the money 

Fruman says he, Kaufman and 
Firestone are proud of; it’s 
the e-mails they receive from 
thankful students and recipi-
ents. Fruman smiles as he reads 
one of the e-mails from a girl 
whose Instagram post Welzoo 
liked. At the end of the e-mail 
reads, “You’ve made my whole 
day.”

“That type of e-mail where 

she sees what our mission is, 
to allow people our age to give 
back in a very small way. You 
know, give back in a way that 
they’re not doing anything; 
they’re literally just changing 
their homepage. And she said at 
the end, ‘You’ve made my whole 
day,’ which obviously, that made 
my month, that was amazing. 
Those are the little things.”

Unexpected feminism 

on new ‘I Don’t Mind’

Juicy J-Usher track 
has a sex-positive 

message

By DANIELLE 

RAYKHINSTHEYN

Daily Arts Writer

When I first heard Usher’s 

“I Don’t Mind,” I was slightly 
appalled by the lyrical con-
tent: “Shawty, I don’t mind if 
you dance on a pole. That don’t 
make you a hoe.” Yet, the radio 
kept playing it (albeit without 
the word “hoe”), and I kept lis-
tening to it because it’s so damn 
catchy. After hearing it about 
a gazillion times, I quickly 
realized that my original mis-
givings came about because 
apparently my brain is still liv-
ing in 1998.

I don’t think anyone would 

deny that rap and hip-hop cul-
ture has long revolved around 
the demeaning of women — of 
“bitches,” “hoes” and “sluts” — 
and that was what originally 
upset me about this song. In 
Juicy J’s portion of the song, he 
says to the stripper, “If you fuck 
me like you love me, shawty, 
you might get rich.”

Juicy, strippers and prosti-

tutes are not the same thing.

It was the understanding 

that any stripper could be con-
vinced at a high enough price to 
go from a completely legal pro-
fessional to a completely illegal 
one. It was the idea presented to 
us by the media that strippers 

have no self-confidence and are 
just objects, so Juicy J can “take 
somebody’s bitch, turn her to a 
slut.”

But, upon listening to the 

song several more times, I 
started to see this song as a 
feminist anthem. While Juicy 
J’s part of “I Don’t Mind” is 
belittling, the rest of the song, 
which Usher sings, is actually 
quite empowering.

In the first verse, Usher 

intones, “I make enough for the 
both of us, but you dance any-
way,” and “you want your own 
and need your own (money), 
baby. Who am I to judge?” While 
I doubt any little girl grows up 
wishing to be an exotic dancer, 
this is where the woman in the 
song has ended up, and Usher is 
OK with that. She is a woman 
who has made her own choices, 
and even though she now has 
a man to take care of her, she 
continues to work in her chosen 
profession.

This actually seems to be the 

epitome of a healthy relation-
ship: Usher trusts his partner 
to go to the strip club to “work 
until three” as long as she goes 
back home to him. It’s just her 
job to take off her clothes, and 
he respects that. It “doesn’t 
make (her) a hoe.”

Usher also seems to know the 

difference between a stripper 
and a prostitute, singing, “They 
be looking but they can’t touch 
you, shawty. I’m the only one to 
get it, so just go ahead and keep 
doing what you do” in the second 
verse. In fact, these lines serve 

as the counter to Juicy J’s verse; 
Juicy is the guy trying to touch 
Usher’s girl, but that’s not her 
job, and Usher is the one saying 
so. She has the right to choose, 
and she chooses to go home to 
Usher. She says no to Juicy mak-
ing her rich, because she already 
has her own money.

Now, don’t get me wrong. 

I’m not saying being a strip-
per is a great thing to aspire to 
be, that it isn’t also submitting 
yourself to be objectified by 
whoever may be watching, be 
they men or women, or that the 
hip-hop industry doesn’t still 
have a ways to go in regard to 
its treatment of women. What I 
am saying is that the woman in 
this song is independent, makes 
choices for herself and is in a 
healthy relationship with a man 
who respects her right to have 
both independence and agency 
for herself.

More and more women are 

choosing to pole dance for fit-
ness, and while it’s very different 
to “dance on a pole” in an exer-
cise classroom, fully clothed, 
and to do the same in front of 
an audience while taking your 
clothes off, the fact remains that 
the choice is empowering. The 
choice of whether to pole dance 
or not; the choice of whether to 
pole dance naked or clothed; the 
choice to pole dance alone or for 
your partner or for an audience 
for money.

And although we don’t need 

a man to tell us that that’s OK, 
it’s kind of nice that Usher is on 
our side.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

When summer starts to slip 

into fall, at the close of August 
or right at the beginning of 
September, 
the worn-out 
neighbor-
hood 
pools 

begin 
to 

close. As one 
of the uni-
versal 
signs 

that summer 
is closing, the 
closing pools 
are 
made 

even 
more 

depressing 
by their changing appearance. 
Leaves and dirt begin to collect 
in them as they start to become 
unused, and then unclean.

One of these grimy, gross 

pools is the landscape for 
Buffalo 
native 
and 
well-

known music producer Emile 
Haynie’s first music video 
from his solo effort, We Fall. 
The video explains the plot of 
his first single off the record, 
“Falling Apart,” which fea-
tures the vocals of Miike Snow 
(aka Andrew Wyatt) and the 
living legend of Brian Wilson. 
Cool right? So is the video.

Starring a skinny highlight-

er blonde with dark eyebrows 
and eyes, the premise of the 
video should be somewhat 
boring. Floating and rolling 

around in a dirty pool filled 
with dead leaves and what 
appears to be sludge shouldn’t 
be this appealing. But the 
warm pinks and purples start 
to fill the pool and the story is 
transformed. “Tattoos on your 
face covered up your skin” 
sings Wyatt as the dark drag-
on eyes and muddy face of the 
deranged blonde gaze up from 
the pool. This song is so soni-
cally multifaceted that it had 
the room and right to descend 
into the weird.

Nothing about this video 

is visually displeasing. It’s a 
gritty video that follows the 
patterns of an imploding girl 
as she starts to fall apart off 
the coast of California. The 
image of the damsel in distress 

following a series of bad deci-
sions in the name of love is a 
bit overused in our popular art 
today. But as the chorus corre-
lates with the images, singing 
“How’d you get so cold, how’d 
you get so cold?” it isn’t so 
annoying. Maybe it’s the pierc-
ing set of eyes this poor little 
lady holds. Or maybe it’s the 
feeling that you’re sitting in on 
someone’s recent acid-induced 
experience. But the trippy 
nature of the video doesn’t feel 
excessive; instead, it accentu-
ates the emotion inspiring the 
lyrics and music. And so you 
leave pitying the poor little 
rich blonde girl. G’damnit, 
just stick around to hear Brian 
Wilson sing.

Daily Arts Writer

On the Pacific coast of North 

America, starfish are falling to 
pieces. A disease called sea star 
wasting syndrome has swept 
the region, causing a massive 
die-off. Limbs fall off, tissue 
deteriorates and the organisms 
die rapidly. Though starfish 
usually regenerate, these ones 
can’t. No one knows why.

What does one do with this 

new piece of bizarre, troubling 
information about the state of 
our oceans? Some will embark 
on extra research, others will 
likely find it uninteresting and 
discard it immediately. Scott 
Beal writes a poem.

Scott Beal, who attended the 

University (and was an Arts 
writer for the Daily), currently 
teaches at the University in 
the English Department, the 
Sweetland Center and the Lloyd 
Hall Scholar’s Program. He 
is also the Dzanc Writer-in-
Residence at Ann Arbor Open 
School, a father and a poet.

“I’ll learn things about the 

world that are puzzling and 
surprising and want to figure 
out what to think of it, what to 
learn from it. I’m really trying 
to learn something about how 
I interact with people and how 
that is mirrored or contradicted 
by the ways that other beings 
on the planet interact with each 
other,” Beal said of his poem, 
“Sea Star Wasting Syndrome.” 
Some of his other poems have 
similar missions, including one 
about the interactions between 

hermaphroditic snails.

Other pieces of Beal’s are 

autobiographical, coming from 
particular 
experiences, 
like 

the time he found a note under 
his windshield wiper accusing 
of him of stealing someone’s 
money, or explaining to one of 
his daughters that lightning can 
strike people.

“I think every poem comes 

from a different place,” he said. 
“You start off with something 
puzzling and try to riddle it 
out.”

Still, a common theme lies at 

the heart of any good poem.

“(A good poem) will move 

us in a new way, and show us 
the path to better compassion, 
a 
better 
sense 
of 
justice 

and fairness,” he said. “It is 
aware of its implications and 
complicities.”

Most of Beal’s poems are not 

direct responses to individual 
issues, though he told me he 
considers privilege and justice 
when he writers. I challenged 
him on this idea, and asked him 
to explain the way that themes 
of justice and compassion are at 
work in “Warning and Watch,” 
the poem about lightning that is 
13 lines long.

His response moved me. 

There are a couple of ways in 
which this path to compassion 
and justice lays beneath the 
imagery of clouds.

“First of all, there is the notion 

of how to help his children 
navigate a dangerous world,” 
he explained, referring to his 
daughter’s fear at the thought of 
being struck by lightning. That 

particular thought opens up a 
general sense of wonder about 
the world.

“In that moment you can 

spin into a consciousness of 
being alive, and increasing your 
awareness of being a living 
organism on the planet also 
helps build empathy and value 
in human life,” he said.

Of course, not all good poems 

need to do this. There are other 
reasons to love and appreciate 
poetry.

“I’m drawn to the idea 

of making language do new 
things, 
energizing 
it 
and 

making 
it 
dazzling 
and 

sizzling,” he said.

In the poetry class he is 

currently 
teaching 
at 
the 

University, he has implemented 
a 
system 
called 
“Gamified 

Grading,” where getting an 
A requires earning a certain 
number of points, say, 3,500. 
Every poem is worth a certain 
number of points, regardless of 
his liking for it, although it can 
be improved with revision.

“We’re trained to think of it 

as, there’s a meaning, you can 
paraphrase it, but only if you 
can decode it. And then you 
think, this isn’t for me, this is 
an art form that is deliberately 
trying to leave me out,” he said.

Boiled 
down, 
I 
received 

three important messages from 
Beal about the power of poetry: 
It utilizes and appreciates the 
best of what language can be, 
it is a means of making sense 
of the world around us and it is 
a means of understanding our 
place within that world.

TRAILER REVIEW

Will Smith seems to own a 

new seriousness in his middle 
age — a more refined sense of 
limits and a less 
naïve sense of 
opportunities. 
Whether 
his 

personality will 
be able to domi-
nate and guide 
“Focus” 
will 

determine the success of the 
movie. The more this movie 
gives to Will Smith, the more it’ll 
take away at the box office.

Margot 
Robbie’s 
charac-

ter doesn’t feel trustworthy in 
any sense. She can’t be trusted 
with the flow of the action. She 
can’t be trusted with any clever 
quips or plot twists. She can’t be 
trusted by or with Smith. But 
it’s clear Smith is going to trust 
her when she reenters his life 
in the second half of the movie 
for the crescendo. If this movie 

is going to play out big, it needs 
Will Smith at the wheel through 
and through.

How much control is Smith 

going to concede to this blonde 
bombshell? How are things 
going to go wrong? No one’s 
expecting a blockbuster, but 

Smith’s magic might be able to 
spin this into something along 
the lines of a modern “Casa-
blanca.”

We have to wait and see who 

screws who. It’ll be a worthy 
flick to see, no matter what.

The University’s 
literary legacy

A 

few days ago, I was at 
home watching clas-
sic Saturday Night 

Live episodes with my parents. 
Between their explaining 
40-some-
thing-
year-old 
pop cul-
ture refer-
ences and 
debating 
whether 
Simon or 
Garfunkel 
was the 
bigger 
diva, we 
discussed how original SNL 
cast member Gilda Radner 
attended the University of 
Michigan.

This conversation got me 

thinking about other famous 
fellow Wolverines. Of course, 
there are some alumni we hear 
about all the time. You probably 
already know about 38th Presi-
dent of the United States, Ger-
ald Ford, as well as Tom Brady, 
four-time Super Bowl Champi-
on Quarterback.

You may know that Madonna 

was enrolled in the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance before 
she moved to New York City 
or that we can also claim actor 
and iconic voice of Darth Vader 
James Earl Jones, as well as 
“Kill Bill” actress Lucy Liu.

But did you know the uni-

versity also has a rich literary 
legacy?

Take 
for 
example 
James 

Avery Hopwood, class of 1905, 
who was the preeminent play-
wright of the 1920s. When he 
died, he left one-fifth of his 
vast estate to his alma mater for 
the creation of the Hopwood 

Awards, which reward students 
for excellence in creative writ-
ing. Since 1931, the Hopwoods 
have recognized the potential 
of some of the greatest literary 
talents of contemporary times.

One such talent was Betty 

Smith, ’31, who took classes at 
the University while raising her 
two children. In 1943, she pub-
lished her seminal novel “A Tree 
Grows in Brooklyn,” a coming-
of-age story centered on a poor 
immigrant family in the early 
twentieth century. The novel 
was later adapted into a film 
and a Broadway musical.

Obviously, no examination 

of 
the 
University’s 
literary 

landscape would be complete 
without mentioning multiple 
Hopwood 
Award 
winner 

and 
Pulitzer 
Prize-winning 

playwright Arthur Miller, a.k.a. 
the dude who was married to 
Marilyn Monroe for five years. 
Author of such classic works 
as “Death of a Salesman” and 
“The Crucible,” Miller is often 
considered to be one of the 
greatest American dramatists 
of all time. He graduated from 
the University in 1938. (Did I 
mention he also wrote for The 
Michigan Daily?)

Another Hopwood winner, 

poet Frank O’Hara, achieved his 
M.A. in English literature from 
the University in 1951. O’Hara, 
known for his intellectual yet 
intensely 
personal 
style 
of 

writing, was a highly influential 
figure in the New York School 
artistic 
movement 
of 
the 

1950s and ’60s. His collected 
poems 
posthumously 
won 

the National Book Award for 
Poetry in 1972. Fans of AMC’s 
hit 
television 
series 
“Mad 

Men” may recognize O’Hara’s 

“Meditations in an Emergency” 
as a reoccurring symbol in 
Season 2.

The 
University 
has 
also 

left quite a mark on children’s 
literature. Chris Van Allsburg, 
author of classics “Jumanji” 
and 
“The 
Polar 
Express” 

and a two-time winner of 
the 
Caldecott 
Medal, 
one 

of 
the 
most 
prestigious 

awards for children’s books, 
graduated from the College 
of Architecture and Design in 
1972. I pity your childhood if it 
didn’t include several viewings 
of the 1995 Robin Williams film 
adaptation of “Jumanji.” And 
the film adaption of “The Polar 
Express” gave us one of the 
greatest Christmas songs of all 
time, Josh Groban’s “Believe.” 
Chris Van Allsburg pretty much 
creates joy and happiness.

Jumping 
back 
to 
Adult 

Fiction, 
Elizabeth 
Kostova, 

MFA ’04, is another Hopwood 
winner who has gone on to find 
tremendous success. Her 2005 
novel “The Historian” became 
the first debut novel to become 
number one on The New York 
Times bestseller list in its first 
week on sale. I admit, I am a 
bit biased regarding Kostova, 
as I absolutely loved the dark, 
Victorian-esque “Historian.”

Clearly, there’s a wide array 

of noteworthy literary alums to 
emulate. So read some of your 
fellow Victors and get inspired 
to write a masterpiece of your 
own. You never know, maybe 
one day the University will 
hand out an award named after 
you.

Didn’t see “Jumanji”?
