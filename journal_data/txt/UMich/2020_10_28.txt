ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

ANN ARBOR, MI | WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2020 | MICHIGANDAILY.COM

How are UMich

students voting

this election?

The Michigan Daily conducted an 

anonymous survey of more than 1,900 

students to understand the political 

leanings of the student body at the 

University of Michigan and what issues 

are most important to them.

The following data was collected 

from Oct. 16 to Oct. 21. All questions 

were 
optional 
and 
no 
personal 

information about the participants was 

stored. Results show 96.4% of student 

respondents said they are planning to 

vote, with 45.2% being first time voters. 

Where are students located this 

semester?

With more than 78% of classes being 

held online prior to the announcement 

of the stay-in-place order last week, 

85.8% of respondents said they are 

located in Ann Arbor this semester. 

Respondents also broke down to 60.7% 

in-state students, 37.9% out-of-state 

and 1.5% international students.

Where are students registered to 

vote?

Majority of students are registered 

to vote in the state of Michigan, with 

33.3% registered to vote in Ann Arbor 

and 47
.7% registered in another 

Michigan district. Of the respondents, 

15.7% were registered in another state, 

0.6% were not registered to vote and 

2.8% were not eligible to vote in this 

election.

How are students planning on 

voting?

Of the students surveyed, 54.1% said 

they have already voted early. Out of 

those students, 40.4% voted through 

mail-in absentee ballots, 10.9% voted 

at either the University of Michigan 

Museum of Art or Ann Arbor Station 

5 and 2.8% voted absentee at the Ann 

Arbor city clerk’s main office. 

The 
UMMA 
satellite 
location 

opened last month, and as of Oct. 13 

more than 3,000 students have voted 

there, 2,600 of which also registering 

to vote.

Furthermore, 31.6% plan to vote 

absentee. Only 14.4% said they plan to 

vote in-person at the polls on election 

day. 

What is the political leaning of 

students?

The survey showed that 42.8% 

of student respondents identified as 

very liberal, about 33% who said they 

identified as ‘somewhat liberal,’ 7
.7% 

said they were somewhat conservative 

and only 3.8% as very conservative. 

About 12.8% of respondents identified 

as moderate. 

Who are students planning to 

vote for?

Of the 1,846 responses to this 

question, 84.5% of respondents said 

they will vote for Joe Biden and 10.1% 

for Donald Trump.

How enthusiastic are students 

about voting?

About 25% of respondents said they 

are very enthusiastic about voting, 

while 39.3% are somewhat enthusiastic. 

About 14% were neutral, and the rest 

were either somewhat unenthusiastic 

or very enthusiastic.

What 
issue 
is 
the 
MOST 

important to students this election?

Environmental and racial justice 

issues were voted as the top election 

concerns by survey respondents, with 

both around 24%.

LSA junior Luke Dillingham has 

been a member of the Climate Action 

Movement on campus since freshman 

year. He said voting is just the minimum 

action students should take to get 

involved with climate change policy.

“These issues don’t end with just 

the election,” Dillingham said. “It’s not 

a productive conversation to say that 

people should just vote and that it’s 

the only strategy to produce change. 

You have to pressure these people to 

stand up for the right thing, regardless 

of which party they’re from. It’s just 

that this is easier to do when they 

(politicians) are from a certain party.”

Dillingham 
also 
said 
local 

elections are important in creating 

change, especially when most of the 

government is not very representative. 

He mentioned A2Zero, the City of 

Ann Arbor’s initiative to go completely 

carbon neutral by 2030.

“Cities also have ways to do really 

impactful work on a smaller scale,” 

Dillingham said. “So, for example, the 

A2Zero plan is very promising. And 

that is sort of a demonstration of some 

of the importance of local politics.”

LSA senior Sarah Jeng said racial 

justice issues have been at the top of her 

mind throughout this election season, 

adding it is important for voters to be 

thinking about these matters while 

casting their ballots. She said it may be 

harder for majority communities to see 

racial inequality issues in America since 

they are not directly impacted by them.

“In the past few years, I think there’s 

been this whole idea that racism maybe 

hasn’t ended completely, but it’s gotten 

a lot better,” Jeng said. “I feel like under 

the surface, there’s still a lot going 

on, it’s just being called something 

different. Racism adapts and evolves 

with the times, and just because it 

doesn’t necessarily look how it looked 

40 years ago, that doesn’t mean it’s 

completely disappeared.”

Jeng said she has watched all of the 

debates. She recalled a specific moment 

during the vice presidential debate 

in which Vice President Mike Pence 

said he did not believe implicit biases 

existed.

“I think that’s really harmful when 

you’re talking about race,” Jeng said. 

“Everyone has implicit biases, and 

that automatically impacts people and 

communities of color.”

What other issues were important 

to students in this election?

Other top priorities included health 

care (16.2%) and the economy (13.8%).

Business sophomore Prisha Grover 

said immigration policy and how 

refugees are treated is an issue that she 

keeps in mind while voting. She also 

said voting gives you access to help 

those who do not have a say in this 

election.

“Immigration is very important 

to me so policies like how we house 

people who are refugees who are trying 

to immigrate to different countries for a 

better life (are important),” Grover said. 

“Sometimes when you’re voting, you’re 

voting for those who don’t have the 

right to vote, whether it is international 

students or those who aren’t legal 

citizens.”

LSA 
freshman 
Nick 
Martens 

interned for a Michigan District 6 

House congressional race the past 

summer. He said he is concerned about 

LGBTQ+ rights and income inequality.

“As a gay person, I think it’s really 

important that we have a president 

who doesn’t just say he’s pro-LGBT but 

actually works towards policies that 

are dismantling systemic oppression 

rather than nominating supreme court 

justices that want to ruin my life,” 

Martens said. “In terms of income 

inequality, Republican ideology of tax 

cuts equals economic growth, I think 

has really hurt American workers over 

the last 40 years, and they still keep 

doing it to us.”

How would students rate the 

Trump administration’s handling of 

the COVID-19 pandemic?

The survey indicated 76.6% of 

student respondents said the Trump 

administration’s 
response 
to 
the 

pandemic has been very bad, with 

another 10% saying it was somewhat 

bad. Around 5% said it was neutral, 

with another 5% saying it was 

somewhat good. Just 2.7% said it was 

very good. 

How 
will 
the 
Trump 

administration’s handling of the 

COVID-19 pandemic influence the 

student vote?

A majority of students (51.5%) said 

it is very likely that the response to the 

COVID-19 pandemic will influence 

their vote with another 18.6% saying it 

was somewhat likely.

Martens 
doesn’t 
believe 
that 

Trump’s handling of the pandemic will 

influence the vote since there are not 

very many swing voters.

“I mean, I’m sure there are some 

people that are actual swing voters 

but, in general, just not super common 

among college students,” Martens said. 

“I don’t know if (the pandemic) shifted 

a lot of people from voting for Trump 

to not voting for Trump.”

How 
will 
out-of-state 
and 

international student voting in 

Michigan affect the election?

Of the 751 student respondents 

who are out of state or international 

students, 428 are registered to vote 

in Ann Arbor or another Michigan 

district. 378 out of these 428 said they 

are voting or planning on voting for 

Biden, which amounts to 88%.

The Michigan Daily has put 

together a 2020 general election 
guide to help Ann Arbor voters 
understand what is on their 
ballot. Look below to see what 
options you have from the two 
major parties in local races this 
November. 

Voting 
in 
Washtenaw 

County and Ballot Drop Boxes 

Early 
absentee 
voting 
in 

Michigan began on Sept. 24 and 
will continue through Nov. 2. 
The deadline to register to vote 
absentee is Oct. 19 and people 
can register to vote in person up 
until Election Day on Nov. 3. 

As of Oct. 12, nearly 50,000 

absentee 
ballots 
have 
been 

issued in the city of Ann Arbor.

All ballots received by 8 p.m. 

on Election Day will be counted. 
Washtenaw County residents 
can return their ballots to 
drop boxes as an alternative to 
mailing them in. Drop boxes are 
located in the following places: 

Outside of Larcom City Hall 

at the north entrance at 301 E. 
Huron St.

Outside of Larcom City Hall 

by the customer service drop 
box on Ann Street, just east of 
Fifth Avenue.

Parking 
lot 
of 
Veterans 

Memorial Park Ice Arena and 
Pool 2150 Jackson Ave.

Outside of the Ann Arbor Fire 

Station 5 at 1946 Beal Ave. 

Outside of Cobblestone Farm/

Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation 
Customer Service Center at 2781 
Packard Road 

Northwest side of Ann Arbor 

Fire Station 6 at the Eisenhower 
entrance at 1881 Briarwood 
Circle

A satellite clerk’s office at the 

University of Michigan Museum 
of Art will remain in place until 
Election Day where students 
and community members can 
register to vote, vote early and 
return absentee ballots. 

Ballot Proposals 
Washtenaw 
County 

Proposal

This proposal will authorize 

a property tax of one-fourth 
of a mill, or $0.25 per $1,000 
of 
state 
assessed 
property 

valuation. 
The 
revenue 

generated from this tax will go 
to the Board of Commissioners 
to purchase natural land areas 
in order to preserve them. The 
tax will cover the purchase, 
maintenance and preservation 
costs of these lands. 

The tax would go into effect 

on Dec. 1, 2021, and remain in 
effect for 10 years. The proposal 
would increase a previously 
approved tax for the same 
purpose by 0.0159 mill.

Ann 
Arbor 
Municipal 

Proposal A

This 
proposal 
would 

implement a property tax for 
Ann Arbor residents of $2.125 
per $1,000 of assessed property 
value, to repair local streets, 
bridges and sidewalks. 

If 
passed, 
the 
proposal 

would replace the previously 
levied identical tax that funded 
street, 
bridge 
and 
sidewalk 

repair and construction from 
2017-2021. 
Some 
portion 
of 

this revenue may also be used 
by the Ann Arbor Downtown 
Development Agency and the 
Washtenaw County Brownfield 
Redevelopment Authority.

Ann 
Arbor 
Municipal 

Proposal B

This 
proposal 
would 

authorize a new property tax for 
Ann Arbor residents of $0.20 per 
$1,000 of property value to fund 
the construction of sidewalks 
from 2021-2026. Some of this 
revenue could be taken and used 
by the Ann Arbor Downtown 
Development Agency and the 

Washtenaw County Brownfield 
Redevelopment Authority.

Ann 
Arbor 
Municipal 

Proposal C

This 
proposal 
would 

authorize a property tax for 
Ann Arbor residents of $1 per 
$1,000 of property value. The 
revenue from this tax would be 
used to construct, maintain and 
acquire new affordable housing 
units for low-income residents 
and 
families. 
Low-income 

individuals are those who make 
less than 60% of the Ann Arbor-
area median income. 

The revenue from this tax 

would also be used to provide 
social services to the low-income 
residents of the housing units 
from 2021-2041. Some of the 
money may be taken and used 
by the Ann Arbor Downtown 
Development Agency and the 
Washtenaw County Brownfield 
Redevelopment Authority. The 
proposal has been endorsed 
by the Ecology Center, the 
Chamber of Commerce, Packard 
Health and Avalon Housing.

Michigan 
Proposal 
20-1: 

Use of State and Local Park 
Funds Amendment

This proposal would amend 

the Michigan Constitution to 
allow the state to collect revenue 
from oil and gas mining taking 
place on state-owned land and 
create, protect and maintain 
parks, nature areas and public 
recreation facilities with the 
money. This amendment would 
let the State Parks Endowment 
Fund continue receiving money 
from the sales of oil and gas 
mined on state property until its 
balance reaches $800 million. 

Other oil and gas revenue 

generated 
from 
state-owned 

lands would go to the Natural 
Resources Trust Fund. The 
amendment would also change 
how this state revenue gets 
spent: 20% of the Endowment 
Fund’s yearly spending would 
go toward improving Michigan 
State Parks, 25% of the Natural 
Resources 
fund’s 
annual 

expenditures would contribute 
to parks and public recreation 
areas and another 25% would be 
used for land conservation. 

This proposal is supported 

by 
several 
environmental 

groups 
including 
the 

Michigan 
Environmental 

Council, 
Michigan 
League 

of 
Conservation 
Voters, 

Natural 
Resources 
Defense 

Council and Michigan NAACP 
Environmental 
and 
Climate 

Justice 
Committee, 
among 

others. However, the Sierra Club 
and the Green Party of Michigan 
do not support this proposal 
because of its dependence on 
continued oil and gas drilling 
for funding. 

Michigan 
Proposal 
20-2: 

Search Warrant for Electronic 
Data Amendment 

This proposal would amend 

the Michigan Constitution to 
mandate that a search warrant 
be necessary to gain access to 
personal electronic records and 
communications. Searches and 
seizures of a person’s electronic 
data would be prohibited without 
a warrant, and conditions for 
obtaining one would be the same 
as those required to search an 
individual’s house or belongings. 
Both the Michigan State Police 
and the American Civil Liberties 
Union have expressed support 
for this proposal. 

Ann Arbor Elections
Ann Arbor City Council
The City Council legislative 

body that is responsible for 
governing the city consists of the 
Mayor and 10 council members 
who each serve four-year terms. 
Citizens are only eligible to vote 
for the City Council candidate in 
the ward in which they reside.

for 
Democratic 
candidates, 

many of the people running 

in the November election are 
unopposed after winning the 
August primaries.

Ward 1
Lisa Disch is the Democratic 

candidate for Ward 1. She has 
prioritized a commitment to 
Ann 
Arbor’s

as well as affordable housing 
in her campaign. She is being 
challenged by Eric Sturgis, who 
is a write-in candidate.

the Democratic candidate for 
Ward 2. Song supports the 
improvement of Ann Arbor’s 
city services and ensuring that 
all residents have equal access 
to them.

Ward 3

Radina 
is 
the 

Democratic candidate in Ward 
3. 
He 
has 
campaigned 
on 

creating 
affordable 
housing 

and promoting diversity and 
inclusion in the city.

Ward 4
Jen 
Eyer 
is 
Ward 
4’s 

Democratic 
candidate. 
Her 

platform promises to support 
equity in water and sewage 
treatment improvements across 
Ann Arbor and to stop flooding 
and power outages in her ward.

Ward 5
Erica Briggs is running as the 

Democratic candidate for Ward 
5. 
She 
supports 
responsible 

housing 
and 
transportation 

growth as well as Ann Arbor’s 
carbon neutrality goals.

The Michigan Daily has put 

together a 2020 general election 
guide to help Ann Arbor voters 
understand what is on their ballot. 
Look below to see what options you 
have from the two major parties 
in federal and state races this 
November. 

Federal and State Elections
President and Vice President 

of the United States

Joseph R. Biden and Kamala 

Harris (D) 

Biden 
is 
the 
Democratic 

presidential nominee. The former 
Vice President served in the 
White House during the Obama 
Administration 
and 
previously 

served as a U.S. Senator from 1973-
2009.

Biden’s campaign “Build Back 

Better” plan focuses on creating 
a 
strong 
economic 
response 

to 
the 
pandemic, 
improving 

racial 
equality, 
providing 
the 

infrastructure needed for clean 
energy and reforming the country’s 
immigration laws.

Harris is the Democratic vice 

presidential nominee. She ended 
her 
personal 
presidential 
bid 

late in 2019 to endorse Biden and 
was named as his running mate 
in August. As a U.S. Senator for 
California, she is on the Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs 
Committee and the Committee on 
the Judiciary, among others. 

She previously served as an 

assistant district attorney and later 
became the Attorney General of 
California. 

Donald J. Trump and Mike 

Pence (R)

Trump 
is 
the 
Republican 

presidential nominee and 45th 
president of the United States. A 
businessman, Trump is the first 
president to be elected without 
prior 
military 
or 
government 

experience. 

Trump’s “Make America Great 

Again” campaign is focusing on 
building a strong economy and 
lowering taxes. Since the start 
of 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic, 

however, the economy has suffered 
as small businesses around the 
country have closed and millions of 
people have lost their jobs. Trump 
recently 
contracted 
COVID-19 

himself but has since recovered.

The Trump campaign has also 

been 
vocal 
about 
introducing 

harsher 
immigration 
policies, 

particularly on the southern border. 

Pence 
is 
the 
Republican 

Presidential 
nominee 
and 
is 

the 48th vice president of the 
United 
States. 
He 
previously 

represented Indiana in the House 
of Representatives from 2001-2013 
and was the Governor of Indiana 
from 2013-2017. 

U.S. Senate
Gary Peters (D)
Peters is a lifetime Michigan 

resident seeking reelection to the 
Senate. He is finishing his first 
term in the Senate where he was 
ranked the fourth most effective of 
all Democratic Senators.

Peters previously served in the 

U.S. House for three terms. After 
serving in the U.S. Navy Reserve 
for more than a decade, Peters is the 
ranking member on the Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs 
Committee and also sits on the 
Armed Services Committee. Peters 
is focused on strengthening the 
Michigan economy, protecting the 
Great Lakes and national security. 

In an interview with The 

Daily this summer, Peters said 
that protecting the Affordable 
Care Act, promoting affordable 
higher education, tackling racial 
inequality and a public-health 
informed COVID-19 response are 
at the top of his agenda. 

John James (R) 
A University of Michigan alum, 

veteran and business owner, John 
James will be challenging Peters 
in November, facing a Democratic 
incumbent for the second time 
after challenging current U.S. 
Senator Debbie Stabenow in the 
2018 election.

James’ campaign is unique, as 

he is the only Black Republican 
running for a seat in the Senate 
in this election cycle and he has 
received 
national 
recognition 

for his tremendous fundraising 
campaign. He has faced criticism 
for his support for the president, 
but has declined to disavow Trump. 
James is focused on building 
an 
innovation-driven 
economy 

by cutting regulation, securing 
borders to protect national security 
and utilizing incentives for private 
corporations to limit pollution and 
protect the environment. 

U.S. House of Representatives
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D) 
Dingell is seeking reelection 

to the United States House of 
Representatives. 
The 
Dingell 

family has held office in Michigan’s 
12th congressional district for more 
than 80 years. She was preceded by 
her late husband John Dingell Jr. 
and his father John Dingell Sr. 

Dingell serves on the House 

Committee 
on 
Energy 
and 

Commerce 
and 
the 
House 

Committee on Natural Resources. 
She has long been an advocate 
for liberal causes from accessible 
health care to the environment. 

Jeff Jones (R)
Jones is challenging Dingell as a 

Republican. Jones currently serves 
as a pastor and works in financial 
services at MassMutual. Jones has 
challenged Dingell in the past three 
election cycles and is focused on 
reforming the health care system, 
improving veterans affairs and 
senior care this election cycle and, 
if elected, wants to break from the 
status-quo of politics to transform 
policy to work more effectively for 
12th district residents. 

Michigan 
House 
of 

Representatives, 53rd District 

Rep. Yousef Rabhi (D) 
Rabhi 
is 
the 
Democratic 

Floor Leader in the Michigan 
House of Representatives and is 
currently serving his second term 
representing the 53rd State House 
district. He has been a consistent 
progressive 
voice 
in 
Lansing, 

advocating 
for 
single-payer 

universal 
healthcare, 
enacting 

Green New Deal policies at the state 
level and reversing cuts to funding 
for public schools and universities.

Jean Holland (R) 
Rabhi’s 
challenger 
Holland 

works 
professionally 
in 
IT 

consulting and as a software 
developer and engineer. Holland 
is a strong advocate for Second 
Amendment rights and supporting 
the growth of businesses across the 
state.

Michigan Supreme Court
While candidates for the state 

Supreme Court are nominated by 
parties, they run in nonpartisan 
races in the general election. 

Bridget Mary McCormack 
McCormack was elected to the 

Michigan Supreme Court in 2012 
and currently serves as the Chief 
Justice. McCormack has been 
endorsed by U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, 
U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, U.S. 
Rep. Debbie Dingell and many 

other democratic local and state 
elected 
officials. 
McCormack 

previously served as a professor and 
associate dean at the University of 
Michigan Law School. McCormack 
currently teaches at the Law School 
and sits on the Board of Washtenaw 
County Families Against Narcotics, 
working to address the opioid crisis. 

Elizabeth Welch 
Welch is a Michigan attorney 

serving individuals, nonprofits and 
small businesses. Welch is a long-
time East Grand Rapids School 
Board Trustee and is the former 
president of the Michigan League 
of Conservation Voters. Welch has 
been endorsed by the Detroit Free 
Press and numerous prominent 
Democrats, including U.S. Reps. 
Debbie Dingell, D-Mich. and Dan 
Kildee, D-Mich. Welch plans to 
bring her diverse set of experiences 
to the court if elected and is focused 
on and passionate about the fight 
for equity in public education.

Mary Kelly 
Kelly is a graduate of Michigan 

State University and received her 
law degree from the Detroit College 
of Law. Kelly previously served as 
a prosecutor in St. Clair County, 
as an attorney and as a general 
practitioner in private practice 
with an emphasis on domestic 

cases, civil litigation and criminal 
matters. Kelly’s platform said she 
is focused on holding individuals 
accountable for their actions if 
elected to the Michigan Supreme 
Court.

Brock Swartzle 
Swartzle has been endorsed 

by more than 85 local officials 
and the Farm Bureau AgriPac, 
Michigan Chamber of Commerce 
and Michigan Realtors. Sawrtzle 
plans to put politics aside and focus 
on the law if elected, particularly 
to respect the federal governing 
bodies but legislate for Michigan as 
a separate sovereign. 

University of Michigan Board 

of Regents

Mark Bernstein (D)
Bernstein has been on the 

board of regents since 2012 and 
is a University of Michigan alum. 
He supports providing accessible 
public education while promoting 
diversity and protecting labor and 
the environment. Over the summer 
Berstein voted in favor of a tuition 
increase in this year’s budget 
and has expressed his support in 
aligning the University with Ann 
Arbor’s carbon neutrality goals.

Shauna Ryder Diggs (D)
Diggs 
also 
graduated 
from 

the University of Michigan as an 

undergraduate and has served on 
the board of regents for the last 
eight years. She supports efforts to 
make college more affordable and 
to provide more equitable funding 
across 
the 
University’s 
three 

campuses. Diggs voted against the 
budget this summer that included 
a tuition increase and has been 
receptive to the Climate Action 
Movement and One University’s 
criticism of the Board’s response to 
climate change.

Carl Meyers (R)
Meyers, also a University alum, 

has previously run for the Board 
of Regents numerous times. He 
supports resuming athletics and 
returning to in-person activities, 
in addition to calling for a tuition 
freeze. Meyers has also said 
he would prioritize protecting 
civil liberties and free speech on 
campus.

Sarah Hubbard (R)
Like Meyers, Hubbard is an 

alum who wants to fight increases 
in tuition and backs returning 
students 
to 
in-person 
classes. 

Hubbard is also a vocal supporter 
of the Second Amendment and pro-
life movement, claiming that these 
voices need to be heard more at the 
University.

Students can still vote under stay-in-place order

Washtenaw County clarifies U-M undergraduates can participate in election-related activities despite COVID-19 restrictions

ANGELINA LITTLE 

Daily Staff Reporter 

University 
of 
Michigan 

undergraduates can vote and 
participate in election activities 
as well as study by themselves 
in designated areas on campus, 
according to a Friday update 
to the stay-in-place order from 
the Washtenaw County Health 
Department.

Registering to vote, working at 

polling stations and participating 
in campaign outreach are all 
allowed.

Students can also go on campus 

to access “essential technology” 
at designated areas with single 
person study spaces. Permitted 
activities 
include 
studying, 

printing or participating in virtual 
classes. The order still prohibits 
studying in groups or going to 
study at coffee shops, restaurants 
or “other establishments where 
multiple 
students/people 
may 

gather, even if they are on campus 
or in U-M buildings.”

Students must follow social 

distancing guidelines and wear 
face masks if they leave their 
homes.

The stay-in-place order issued 

by the county Tuesday to prevent 
further 
spread 
of 
COVID-19 

initially included a number of 
exceptions for students to leave 
their residences, including voting. 
The 
University 
continues 
to 

encourage students to vote.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel stressed this exception 
to the order in his weekly COVID-
19 update email Friday morning.

“The 
Washtenaw 
County 

Health Department Stay in Place 
order 
specifically 
exempted 

election 
related 
activities 
at 

polling places, including going out 

to register to vote and to vote on 
or prior to election day,” Schlissel 
wrote. “Additionally, the order 
exempts working or volunteering, 
which could include working at 
a polling place, to the extent the 
work cannot be done remotely 
and you have the approval of the 
employer.”

Students are encouraged to 

continue to make use of the Ann 
Arbor City Clerk satellite office 
in the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art, which opened 
last month to assist students in 
registering and voting in the 
upcoming election. As of Oct. 

13, more than 2,600 students 
registered to vote and around 
3,000 voted in-person or returned 
their 
absentee 
ballot 
at 
the 

UMMA. 

With 11 days to Election Day, 

UMMA will extend its hours to 
remain open on Saturdays from 
8 a.m. to 4 p.m. beginning on 
Saturday. 

Macy 
Lighthall, 
assistant 

manager at the UMMA store, said 
she has observed some difference 
in student traffic since the stay-
in-place order took effect but says 
it remains unclear how exactly it 
will affect the number of students 

voting. 

“The day before the stay-at-

home mandate, or order, we had 
a line for voting… almost to the 
street … along with full capacity 
inside the building,” Lighthall 
said. “And then today, for a very 
nice day on Friday, around noon, 
it’s been very quiet. We don’t 
have a full line, we are not at full 
capacity, so… I guess I would say 
there’s definitely been a difference 
but I don’t know the numbers 
exactly for the week.”

Daily News Reporter Angelina 

Little can be reached at angelit@
umich.edu. 


Sarah Hubbard, Republican candidate for the 

University of Michigan’s Board of Regents, is 
looking to balance the political powers that she says 
are hindering the board’s ability to have a robust 
discussion about issues affecting students. 

Hubbard is one of two Republicans challenging 

Democratic incumbents Mark Bernstein and Shauna 
Ryder Diggs for their seats on the board in the 
upcoming November election. Currently, Regent 
Ron Weiser (R) is the only Republican on the eight-
person board.

According to Hubbard, the University’s response 

to COVID-19 is the most important topic for students 
right now. She said, despite Tuesday’s stay-in-place 
order from Washtenaw County specifically directed 
at undergraduate students, instruction should be 
in person. She noted that attending class or other 
University-related responsibilities are not the reason 
for the recent spikes in COVID-19 on campus, 
according to school leaders.

“Students are spending a lot of money to get 

that education, and they never really plan to get 
it all remotely,” Hubbard said. “There needs to be 
in-person learning opportunities in a way that can be 
done safely for everybody. Students need to get the 
value for their tuition here.”

Hubbard, who owns Acuitas LLC in Lansing, 

holds two University of Michigan degrees and has 
a history of working in Republican politics. Her 
platform aims to protect freedom of speech on 
campus, lower tuition and bring more diversity of 
thought to the board. 

Part of Hubbard’s reason for running is because 

she wants to even the playing field.

“I think my experience is the kind of thing that the 

board needs right now,” Hubbard said. “You have a 
real imbalance on that board from a Dem-Republican 
perspective. And I think that I could help bring 
balance back to that board and those discussions.”

Hubbard said her background in politics has taught 

her how to develop strong, bipartisan relationships, 
though she leans right. She has previously donated to 
both Democrats and Republicans running for office 
in Michigan, including the Michigan Republican 
Party and Michigan Democrats U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell and Sen. Gary Peters. 

University of Michigan Regent Mark Bernstein 

(D)
says he’s running for reelection this

November to settle unfinished business. In his
first election bid in 2012, he drove a school bus
around the state covered in slogans like “Keep
College Affordable” and “Higher Education,
Lower Cost.”

“I’ve had some success in that direction, and 

I’ve kept that promise, but there’s still a lot more 
to be done,” Bernstein said in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily. 

Bernstein pointed to the Go Blue Guarantee, 

which offers free tuition to in-state students 
coming from families making $65,000 a year or 
less, as a major initiative he’s championed. He 
also said the University has reduced net tuition 
for most Michigan families since he was elected 
in 2012.

Affordability isn’t the only issue facing the 

school. The University is being sued by both 
sexual assault victims and a former student 
accused of sexual assault in high-profile lawsuits. 

An independent report found accusations of 

decades of sexual misconduct by Martin Philbert, 
the former provost who rose to the second highest 
office at the University despite knowledge of 
allegations by numerous administrators. 

Bernstein said misguided interpretations of 

fiduciary responsibility often lead organizations 
to work against victims’ interests. His campaign 
website says the University must be “victim and 
justice centered” and that “our bias should be 
towards the victims, not the institution.”

“It’s in the long-term interest of the institution 

to address these issues in a way that’s focused on 
making things right for the victims — for people 
who are harmed by the institution — because then 
you are preserving the integrity of the institution 
in the long run,” Bernstein told The Daily. 

After this summer’s 1.9% tuition increase as 

part of a budget Bernstein voted for, some students 
advocated for drawing from the endowment to 
keep tuition frozen. Bernstein supported the 
tuition increase in June, explaining that it would 
only be students who could afford to pay tuition 
who would be bearing the brunt of the policy.

University Regent Shauna Ryder Diggs (D) is 

running for her second term on the University of 
Michigan’s Board of Regents to expand financial 
aid initiatives and provide her expertise as 
a practicing physician to the board amid the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Ryder Diggs and fellow incumbent Regent 

Mark Bernstein (D) are running to keep their 
seats against challengers Sarah Hubbard (R) 
and Carl Meyers. Hubbard is participating in her 
first election for Board of Regents, while Carl 
Meyers is running in his third. 

As a University alum and the child of 

college professors, Ryder Diggs said her family 
commitment to education makes her a valuable 
member of the board. She also has experience 
serving on other community boards such as the 
Detroit Institute of Arts and Blue Cross Blue 
Shield Foundation of Michigan. 

Ryder Diggs said the accomplishment she 

is most proud of during her time on the board 
is supporting and expanding the Go Blue 
Guarantee. Ryder Diggs said she wants to 
ensure the legacy of the Go Blue Guarantee and 
other initiatives that will benefit students in the 
future. 

“There’s more work to be done and you have 

to be at the table to keep past accomplishments 
going,” Ryder Diggs said. 

After the board decided to freeze future 

fossil fuel investments amid consistent demands 
from the Climate Action Movement, Bernstein 
announced at the October regents meeting that 
the board will be looking into possible avenues 
to divest from the fossil fuel industry. Ryder 
Diggs said she is hopeful experts can find a path 
that allows the University to divest without 
sacrificing revenue for financial aid.

“What many people say is that we need our 

investments to bring the best return possible 
so that we can be able to give the financial aid 
that we want to give and expand the Go Blue 
Guarantee to give it to Flint and Dearborn,” 
Ryder Diggs said. “That definitely resonates 
with me, but I don’t think the two things are 
mutually exclusive.”

Carl Meyers is in the middle of his third 

campaign for regent at the University of 
Michigan. Meyers also made a bid in 2014 but 
didn’t get enough votes at the Republican State 
Convention to get through to the general election.

He hasn’t changed his message much since his 

first campaign in 2004, and he said he feels his 
policies are more relevant than ever.

“I ran for the Board of Regents in 2004 

predicting that if we didn’t slow the growth of the 
budget and put Michigan families and Michigan 
students first … that many middle-class families 
would be priced out of higher education, (which) 
would severely impact diversity, inclusion and 
access,” Meyers said. “Here we are in the middle 
of a pandemic, and shame on the (Board of 
Regents) for raising tuition … and shame on the 
administration.”

Meyers took several opportunities to discuss 

the 1.9-percent tuition increase approved over 
the summer and said he has made access to 
higher education a theme of his campaign. His 
goals include a tuition freeze and a rollback of 
this year’s increase.

When discussing the practicality of his tuition 

freeze, Meyers pointed to his background as 
a financial adviser, saying his experience on 
nonprofit boards and with investments makes 
him more qualified than the current board. He 
said he would push for a larger portion of the 
endowment to be distributed to meet operating 
expenses in addition to finding inefficiencies 
throughout the University. Currently, 4.5 percent 
of its value is distributed annually.

“U of M is … a massive hospital system, a 

massive sports complex, a massive academic 
(operation),” Meyers said. “It’s inherent with any 
operation that there are opportunities to become 
more efficient. I’m not saying you’ve got to cut, 
but I’m saying you’ve got to operate with a heck 
of a lot more efficiency.”

Meyers said Regents don’t focus enough on 

cutting student costs.

“It’s going to take a seismic cultural change 

to do that, and I think COVID is going to be the 
impetus for that,” Meyers said.

Results could take a while with record mail-in ballots 

In 
previous 
election 
cycles, 

results have been reported on 
election night as precincts tally their 
votes, with a winner being declared 
hours after polls close. This year, 
however, a final result may not be 
available for days or weeks after 
the election. With concerns around 
the safety of in-person voting, a 
record number of voters are using 
absentee ballots. The restrictions 
on when and how election officials 
count absentee ballots, as well as an 
expected increase in voter turnout 
for the particularly contentious 
election, make it unclear how long 
voters will wait for a result. 

This will be a particularly 

important factor in Michigan, a key 
state in the 2020 election, which 
had the smallest margin of victory 
in the 2016 election and had record 
turnout in the August primary. 

Michigan’s 
ballot-counting 

plan

In 2018, Michigan legislators 

passed a no-excuse absentee voting 
law, meaning anyone can request an 
absentee ballot without providing 
their reasoning, likely resulting in an 
increase in the number of absentee 
ballots. Michigan Secretary of 
State Jocelyn Benson also mailed 
applications for mail-in ballots to 
every registered voter using funding 
provided by the federal government 
through 
the 
Coronavirus 
Aid, 

Relief and Economic Security Act. 
The goal is to prevent the spread 
of the coronavirus, ensuring “no 
Michigander has to choose between 
their health and their right to vote.”

In recent weeks, the rate of 

spread of COVID-19 has increased 
in Michigan. In an Oct. 21 press 
conference, 
Michigan 
Gov. 

Gretchen Whitmer said the COVID-
19 situation in Michigan is getting 
worse and that she was “sounding 
the alarm.” 

“I’m just going to be frank: our 

numbers are not good,” Whitmer 
said. “They’re moving in the wrong 
direction.” 

In the August primary, more 

absentee voter ballots were cast 
than 
in 
any 
other 
Michigan 

election. Out of the 2.5 million total 
votes cast in Michigan, 1.6 million 
of those were from absentee ballots. 
The previous record for absentee 
ballots was 1.3 million in the 2016 
presidential election. Benson has 
said she expects at least 2.4 million 
people to vote by mail in the Nov. 3 
election. 

The rules for handling these 

absentee ballots, however, may 
result in vote counting delays. Clerks 

cannot begin opening and counting 
ballots until 7 a.m. on Election Day, 
the same time the in-person polling 
locations open. With so many votes 
being cast by mail, this will likely 
take longer than in previous years. 

Not only will more absentee 

ballots be cast, but more votes will 
likely be cast overall. The 2.5 million 
votes in the August election was a 
record for primary election votes, 
and election officials said they 
believe approximately 5 million 
Michigan voters are expected to 
participate in the general election. 

Benson has discussed the likely 

delays on Election Day, explaining 
in an NBC interview there will 
likely not be full results on election 
night. 

“We should be prepared for this 

to be closer to an election week as 
opposed to an Election Day,” said 
Benson. “The bottom line is that we 
are not going to have the full results 
and accounting of all of our ballots 
on election night. We already know 
that. We’ve asked the legislature 
to make changes to the law to give 
us more ability to be prepared and 
count those ballots more efficiently 
— they have not acted, for reasons I 
don’t fully, completely understand.”

She also discussed the steps 

election officials are taking to count 
voters more quickly and efficiently, 
while stressing the importance of 
accurate reporting. 

“We’re increasing tabulators, 

we’re increasing capacity to more 
efficiently 
and 
securely 
count 

those ballots — but I’m also laser 
focused on accuracy,” said Benson. 
“If it takes a few extra days to make 
sure we have a full and accurate 
counting of the results of every race, 
that’s what it’s going to take. We’re 
going to be transparent throughout 
that whole process to make sure 
every citizen knows exactly where 
we are in the counting process and 
how many more ballots we have to 
get through.”

Washtenaw 
County 
Clerk 

Lawrence Kestenbaum said he 
believes many election offices, 
and certainly those in Washtenaw 
County, are equipped to quickly 
count ballots and provide results. He 
also acknowledges some Michigan 
cities, such as Detroit and Flint, will 
likely have a harder time providing 
results quickly, as they have opted 
not to pre-process ballots. 

“So, there’s been a lot of thought 

put into these things and we’ve 
made a lot of progress,” Kestenbaum 
said. “I’m very confident that it 
should go smoothly, at least in 
Washtenaw County. Contrary to 
some of the rumors that are going 
around, there’s not going to be a 

delay in counting absentee ballots. 
Absentee ballots will be counted 
on Election Day at the same time as 
other ballots and they’ll be reported 
on election night the same as other 
... precincts.” 

Kestenbaum said he does not 

agree with claims in the media 
about Michigan being one of the 
last states to report.. He believes 
the results will be in by the next 
morning. In other elections, such 
as the March primary, results were 
reported before 10 p.m., only hours 
after polls closed. 

Concerns 
circling 
around 

mail-in ballots

Some are concerned about an 

increase in voter fraud in this 
election cycle, particularly resulting 
from the increase in absentee 
voting.. 
Others 
are 
concerned 

ballots will be invalidated because 
of strict laws surrounding how 
mail-in ballots are placed in the 
envelope and signed. 

Though Trump’s administration 

has planted seeds of doubt about the 
legitimacy of mail-in ballots, voter 
fraud in the United States is very 
low. 

Nick Schuler, vice chair of College 

Republicans at the University of 
Michigan and LSA sophomore, 
discussed how he thinks in-person 
voting can be made safer and how 
mail-in voting can still happen, 
while reducing the risk of voter 
fraud. 

“I think we should do voting as 

usual, but obviously with increased 
sanitary measures at the polling 
places, ...,” Schuler said. “But should 
someone not feel comfortable voting 
in person, despite those measures, I 
think they should be able to request 
a mail-in ballot like you can every 
other election … I don’t see the 
need to just automatically send 
(applications) to everyone when you 
can request one like normal (which 
would be) way less prone to fraud 
because you have to go through that 
process.” 

Regina Egan, LSA and STAMPS 

junior 
and 
communications 

director of College Democrats, 
wrote in an email to The Michigan 
Daily she believes mail-in voting is 
especially important in light of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. While she is 
not concerned about voter fraud, she 
is apprehensive about results being 
challenged and the focus of scrutiny 
centering on mail-in ballots. 

“All Americans deserve to be 

able to vote freely and safely,” Egan 
wrote. “In the middle of a pandemic, 
the ability to vote absentee or 
by mail is even more crucial in 
preserving American democracy 
and protecting American lives. I 

absolutely trust the mail-in voting 
system to be safe from things like 
voter fraud. What I am worried 
about is the fact that the large 
number of mail-in ballots is so 
unprecedented, which means that if 
the election is narrow enough, then 
those mail-in ballots will be highly 
contested in a long drawn-out, 
polarizing and partisan way.” 

In the August primary, 10,600 

ballots were rejected. 2,225 were 
rejected because the envelopes 
were not signed or the signature of 
the voter did not match that which 
the election office had on file. 

Because 
of 
Michigan’s 

importance in the election, these 
rejected ballots have become a 
concern for many voters. Trump 
won Michigan with only 10,704 
votes in 2016, almost the same 
number of ballots that were rejected 
in Michigan’s August primary. 

Kestenbaum tried to alleviate 

concerns about signature laws, 
explaining the ballots rejected as 
a result are a small proportion of 
ballots received. He also said clerks 
will try and contact voters to rectify 
problems with their ballots. 

“In 
Michigan, 
if 
it’s 
your 

signature and your handwriting, 
it’s not gonna be thrown out for 
being different,” Kestenbaum said. 
“The proportion of signatures and 
absentee ballots that fail signature 
matching is tiny. Historically, you 
know, it’s not a large percentage, 
by any means. The most common 
problem with the ballot is if 
someone forgets to sign it, the 
outside envelope. And the rules 
now are that if there’s time before 
the election, the clerk will contact 
the voter to have them know that 
they can come in and sign it or do 
something to remedy the problem.” 

Anxieties 
regarding 
the 

United States Postal Service 

Many voters and elected officials 

have also expressed doubts about 
the United States Postal Service, 
both in their ability to deliver ballots 
on time and to handle the sensitive 
nature of mail-in ballots. 

In the August primary, 6,400 

of the 10,600 ballots rejected were 
received after election day, and 
therefore could not be counted. 
USPS told Michigan and 44 other 
states in August they cannot 
guarantee mail-in ballots would 
arrive on time to be counted in the 
November election. 

These issues have largely arisen 

over the past few months, as the 
amount of mail and packages has 
increased during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Trump also appointed 
Louis DeJoy, a vocal Republican 
donor and Trump supporter, as 

Postmaster General in May of 2020, 
after the pandemic had already 
complicated voters’ ability to cast 
votes in person. 

DeJoy has made many changes 

to the agency, including limiting 
overtime hours, removing about 15% 
of high speed processing machines, 
reshuffling top leadership and 
implementing 
restrictions 
on 

transportation, all of which seem to 
be increasing delivery times. Eleven 
high speed delivery bar code sorters 
were removed from Detroit, a city 
many believe will have difficulty 
processing ballots on election day. 

Benson has discussed the steps 

Michigan is taking to ensure mail 
in ballots are received on time and 
the controversy surrounding USPS, 
including constant communication 
with 
postmaster 
leaders 
and 

creating drop boxes. 

“But we’re now also facing a 

perception issue — that the changes 
in the postal service, if nothing else, 
have created confusion and chaos 
where none existed prior,” Benson 
said.

Despite an initial court ruling 

that would have allowed Michigan 
ballots postmarked by Election Day 
that arrived up to 14 days after to be 
counted, the ruling was overturned 
by an appeals court earlier this 
month, reinstating the 8 p.m. 
Election Day deadline. 

Kestenbaum said more absentee 

ballots have been returned earlier 
this year, possibly eliminating some 
concerns that large proportions of 
ballots would not arrive on time. He 
also suggested those who have not 
returned a mail-in ballot yet to drop 
it off at a city or county clerk’s office. 

Many 
Republican 
politicians 

believe the increase in mail-in 
ballots through USPS will result in 
an increase in voter fraud, as Trump 
has often claimed. 

Kestenbaum explained clerk’s 

offices have procedures set up to 
ensure no ballot tampering occurs 
and have multiple people working 
together on sensitive tasks.

“We have a very good record 

in Michigan of administering 
elections in a completely clean 
and fair way,” Kestenbaum said. 
“Poll workers, by the way, have 
to identify their parties so you 
have two poll workers of different 
parties doing every sensitive task. 
So if it involves handling ballots, 
you have a Republican and a 
Democratic coworker together, 
doing whatever needs to be done 
with the ballots.” 

Schuler referred to a case in 

New Jersey where a USPS worker 
was arrested for allegedly dumping 
mail, including election ballots. But 

most experts say when problems 
arise with mail-in voting, they do 
not give either party an advantage 
and do not lead to a false election 
outcome. 

“I have all the respect in the 

world for the postal service, but I 
don’t think a simple postal worker 
should be in charge of delivering 
200,000 ballots that could swing a 
state and then swing the election,” 
Schuler said.

Kestenbaum disagrees with the 

concerns about USPS handling 
ballots, saying poll workers will 
handle ballots correctly. 

“Postal workers are busy and 

they’re dealing with a tremendous 
quantity of mail all the time,” 
Kestenbaum said. “And the idea 
that they would single out a piece 
of mail, out of the thousands of 
pieces that they’re dealing with at 
any given point and say, ‘aha, this 
is someone from the wrong party, 
so I need to get rid of their ballot.’ — 
they don’t have time for that. ... So I 
think the American postal service is 
trustworthy.” 

When asked how he expects 

election results to unfold and how 
Trump will react, Schuler said he 
thinks the president will respect 
the election outcome, but that the 
way it is decided will certainly be 
interesting. 

“I think that the president 

will respect the outcome of the 
election,” Schuler said. “But again, 
that being said, this election is going 
to be interesting. Who knows what’s 
gonna happen, when the results are 
coming. You know, we could have 
a Gore-Bush scenario where the 
Supreme Court has a lot of sway, so 
we’ll see.”

Egan 
also 
mentioned 
the 

drawn-out 2000 election between 
former Vice President Al Gore 
and former President George W. 
Bush, explaining she thinks a clear 
result would help reassure people 
the government is still functioning 
correctly. 

“Concerns about US electoral 

processes go back even before 
2016 to 2000 with Gore and Bush,” 
Egan wrote. “I believe Americans 
want fast and clear results after 
election night because it proves that 
American democracy is safe and 
working, and the 2000 presidential 
election was anything but that. 
If a large number of ballots is 
invalidated for technicalities, then 
this points to some part of our 
electoral process that is not working 
because American votes are not 
getting counted.”

In 2016, LSA senior Cory Dubin, 

a high school senior at the time, 
walked into his local polling station 
in White Lake, Michigan. Under 18 
at the time, he wasn’t there to vote, 
but to be a poll worker. 

He said he walked out of the 

polling station with new insights on 
existing barriers to voting. 

“Having worked at the polls, 

there were certain things where I 
noticed that people were missing 
the opportunity to vote,” Dubin 
said. “Not because they just didn’t 
know there was an election or 
something but because of mainly, 
voter (mis)education … People who 
want to vote should have the right 
to do that — and there should be 
nothing standing in the way.”

Dubin 
became 
an 
Andrew 

Goodman Foundation ambassador 
his junior year of college. In this 
role, he works with the Ginsberg 
Center for Community Service 
and Learning and the Big Ten 
Voting Challenge to increase voter 
registration across the University of 
Michigan campus. 

The Big Ten Voting Challenge, 

founded in 2017, aims to produce 
civic engagement and increase 
voter participation among students 
across the 14-school conference, 
including the University. Ahead 
of the 2020 election, the Big Ten 
Voting Challenge has worked with 
the Ginsberg Center and other 
organizations across campus to 
increase voter participation among 
University students. 

Michigan is a state where 

students 
could 
prove 
to 
be 

especially important, since it is 
considered a key battleground 
state in the 2020 election. In 2016, 
President Donald Trump beat 
then-Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton by just more than 10,000 
votes in Michigan. 

In 
2016, 
37,456 
University 

students were eligible to vote, and 
about the same number or more 
are eligible to vote in this upcoming 
election. However, only 25,557 were 
registered in 2016 and only 16,740 
ended up voting. 

Usually, Dubin and the Ginsberg 

Center would table and talk directly 
to students. Because COVID-19 has 
made traditional methods of voter 
outreach unsafe, the group has 
launched an Instagram page and 

other virtual outreach campaigns 
to encourage voters to participate in 
the electoral process.

“What I would say is that 

students 
really 
(have 
started 

to) realize their votes do make 
a difference,” Dubin said. “And 
whichever candidate you’re voting 
for, you can either extend that lead 
or minimize it. (So we need to make) 
sure that regardless of party, people 
do know that their votes do matter, 
and they actually can impact the 
results.”

LSA professor Josh Pasek, who 

focuses on political communication 
and how media influences political 
attitudes, said social media can be 
a useful tool to disseminate and 
receive voting information. 

“In 
addition, 
social 
media 

tends to display voting as a more 
normative behavior,” Pasek said. “So 
you’re less likely to see other people 
doing democratic participatory acts 
just walking around than you are to 
see them on social media.”

Due to efforts by organizations 

like the Big Ten Voting Challenge, 
in the 2018 midterms, the average 
number of registered student voters 
in the Big Ten conference hit 43%, 
3% higher than the national average 

student voting rate and more than 
double the rate in 2014. At the 
University, the number of average 
voters more than tripled from 2014 
to 2018, going from 14% to 41%. 

The passage of Proposal 3 in 

2018, a voter initiative that amended 
the state constitution and expanded 
voter rights of Michiganders and 
voter education efforts, also helped 
organizations like the Big Ten 
Voter Challenge reach students and 
get them registered to vote. The 
proposal allowed future elections 
to have same-day registration and 
absentee voting without an excuse.

This year, the Big Ten Voting 

Challenge has also launched the 
campaign “Student Orgs Vote!” 
which 
partners 
with 
student 

organizations to encourage their 
members to make a voting plan. 

Public Policy junior Lena Hoppe, 

philanthropy chair for Beta Alpha 
Rho, a pre-law and public policy 
fraternity on campus that has joined 
the campaign, said her organization 
had a meeting dedicated to sharing 
resources from the campaign.

“Especially for younger students 

or freshmen, I think it can be 
overwhelming for first-time voters 
… That’s why it’s important to lay 

everything out there,” Hoppe said. 
“And if you can vote, and here are all 
your options and your ways of doing 
this, we’re not forcing you to do it, 
just (encouraging) you to do it.”

Members of the Big Ten Voting 

Challenge also volunteer at the Ann 
Arbor City Clerk’s satellite office at 
the University of Michigan Museum 
of Art. The UMMA satellite office 
opened on Sept. 22, National Voter 
Registration Day, after efforts by 
campus organizations like the 
Creative Campus Voting Project to 
increase student voter registration 
and engagement. 

One of the volunteers, Public 

Policy senior Meredith Days, said 
it is encouraging to see students of 
all ages volunteering, registering to 
vote and casting their ballots at the 
UMMA. 

“There’s just a lot of people 

signed up to (to volunteer), which is 
great, and has been really exciting 
to see because it’s a lot of people 
that I don’t know,” Days said. “Like 
younger students, which is great 
because I feel like I know a lot of 
people who are seniors, but I’m glad 
that underclassmen are signing up 
to do this well.”

Jacqueline Beaudry, city clerk of 

Ann Arbor, said in an email to The 
Michigan Daily that the satellite 
office has registered 100 to 200 
student voters every day for the past 
40 days. 

“Student volunteers at UMMA 

with the Big Ten Voting Challenge 
have helped work the line, answer 
questions and hand out forms,” 
Beaudry said. “This has been a 
great assistance to the City Clerk 
staff working the registration tables 
and issuing ballots as quickly and 
efficiently as possible.”

Dubin, who also interns with 

the clerk’s office, said this year’s 
momentum in increasing voter 
turnout 
and 
emphasizing 
the 

importance of voting will impact 
future elections. 

“I do not think it’s going to be 

limited to just one election, where it’s 
like, ‘Okay, we voted, our candidate 
won, let’s call it a day,’” Dubin said. 
“Regardless of what happens in the 
election, you’re going to see voters, 
or potential voters really making 
sure that they continue to engage 
with the democratic process.”

Unfortunately, this immigrant 

mentality that hard work equates to 
success is wildly inapplicable to real 
life. Not everyone who puts their all 
into succeeding is actually afforded 
the opportunity to make it — it is the 
explicit responsibility of all Ameri-
cans, but particularly immigrants 
and people of color, to dedicate them-
selves to uplifting those who, for 
whatever reason, couldn’t even grab 
a chair, let alone join you at the table. 
Voting is the first step to exercising 
that responsibility.

From casual conversations with 

community members both in Michi-
gan and in Florida, we have gleaned 
that Arabs who support Trump tend 
to do so for two main reasons — they 
don’t want to pay more taxes, or 
they agree with his more conserva-
tive social views. These Arabs also 
might distrust both candidates and 
the political process, or just believe 
Trump’s 
discriminatory 
policies 

won’t impact them in any way. How-
ever, no matter what your religion 
or how white-passing you are, being 
Middle 
Eastern/Arab 
inherently 

paints a target on your back. If you 
are lucky enough to vote based on 
taxes or socially conservative values, 
we would like to remind you that 
your success, while definitely hard 
earned, comes with an element of 
privilege. For these issues to be your 
deal breaker, you are neglecting all 
of the harmful effects of another 
Trump presidency on those less 
lucky than you. 

With the election nearing, we 

Arabs must recognize what is at stake 
for our communities. As people who 
are historically neglected and left out 
of census data, showing up to vote — 
and voting in our best interest — is 
crucial. Many Arab Americans voted 
for Trump in 2016, and it appears 
many could be voting for him in the 

upcoming election as well. To better 
understand why this is occurring, we 
have compiled a list of the most com-
mon reasons we’ve heard as reasons 
why Arabs are supporting Trump or 
not voting at all, along with rebuttals 
we can use to encourage our fellow 
Arabs to vote for Joe Biden.

Debunking Reason 1. I support 

him fiscally, at least he’s not rais-
ing my taxes!

Arabs are very entrepreneurial 

people. We’ve all heard the narrative 
of “coming to America with nothing 
but $5 and the clothes on our backs,” 
building ourselves from the ground 
up. Donald Trump is a businessman 
who promotes the individualism 
and independence championed by so 
many Arab Americans. So it comes 
as no surprise that wealthy Arabs 
support his narrative, not wanting to 
fork over their hard-earned cash. 

What they don’t seem to realize 

is that under Biden’s plan, only the 
wealthiest of Americans, those mak-
ing more than $400,000 annually, 
will experience hikes in their taxes — 
and analyses of Biden’s tax plan find 
that the percentage of earners who 
would experience these tax increas-
es is less than 2%. Even then, those 
between the 95th and 99th percen-
tile in the income bracket will only 
experience a tax increase of about 
1%, which is too insignificant a dif-
ference to influence your vote. 

The truth is, if your taxes increase 

marginally, you’ll survive. Not only 
that, but coming from a culture that 
highly prioritizes charity and giving 
back, you can rest assured that any 
extra taxes you may pay will be going 
towards noble causes, like public 
infrastructure, child care, education, 
housing and healthcare accessibil-
ity. While you will survive either 
way, the same can’t be said for our 
Arab and POC brothers and sisters 
who are more directly targeted by 
Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhet-
oric and legislation. The detriment to 
your bank account should not influ-
ence your vote more than the lives 

of those most vulnerable to Trump’s 
ideologies. 

 Debunking Reason 2. But I 

agree with his social policies and 
his values.

Another major reason Arabs sup-

port Trump is for his more conser-
vative social views, particularly the 
way he adamantly opposes LGBTQ+ 
rights and abortion. Regardless of 
our own views on these issues (which 
are not the purpose of this piece), to 
champion Donald Trump as a savior 
of good values is, in our opinion, a 
very illegitimate rationality. 

Let us be clear — Donald J. Trump 

is a sexist, bigoted, racist, Islamopho-
bic, xenophobic and genuinely awful 
human being. Must we remind you 
of his various sexual assault charges 
and derogatory comments towards 
women? How about his mocking 
of disabled folks? Even if you don’t 
believe the women who alleged sex-
ual assault against him, there is video 
evidence that he’s encouraged sexual 
assault, saying “grab them by the 
p****.” Though you may share some 
similarities with Trump’s baseline 
conservative views, we hope your 
values don’t align with his, because 
he represents the complete oppo-
site of good Christian (or Muslim or 
ANY) values. No religion or belief 
system has the foundation of hate 
that Trump has spread throughout 
the nation and the world. 

Debunking Reason 3. Okay, but 

this just doesn’t affect me.

The next point we will address 

is the misconception that Trump’s 
hateful rhetoric just doesn’t apply to 
these voters. Put simply, it does. No 
matter how well off or white-passing 
you are, the wellbeing of your com-
munity, your people, is at stake. A 
misconception we have seen from 
Arab and Middle Eastern Christians 
is that Trump is their savior, target-
ing the same Muslims who may have 
targeted them back in their home 
countries. Without needing to get 
into Middle Eastern politics, all we 
ask is that you recognize that, as 

minorities, none of us are safe. And 
if that doesn’t work, here are ways 
Trump’s policies actually do affect 
you. 

First, while commonly known as 

the Muslim ban, Executive Order 
13769 targeted all migrants com-
ing from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, 
Yemen, Sudan and Somalia regard-
less of religious background. Also, 
white nationalist hate groups have 
increased by 55% since Trump took 
office. These terrorists will not ask 
about your beliefs before perpetuat-
ing hate crimes — they will see your 
skin color or hear your accent and 
that will be enough. Another Trump 
term also brings about a question of 
safety, for yourself and also for your 
children. Trump has consistently 
sided with the NRA and gun lobby-
ists despite his term seeing the dead-
liest mass shooting in U.S. history 
and 263 shootings at schools. To fur-
ther elucidate the dangerous impact 
of Trump’s ideologies, the murderer 
in the Christchurch Mosque shoot-
ing in New Zealand quoted Trump 
as justification for his violence, cast-
ing him as “a symbol of renewed 
white identity and common pur-
pose.” This is not the only example. 
Trump serves as a beacon of hope 
and empowerment for violent white 
supremacists everywhere. 

In addition, the Trump admin-

istration’s current response (or lack 
thereof) to COVID-19 affects us all. 
Trump knowingly downplayed the 
seriousness of the virus instead of 
acting in the early stages, admitting 
to slowing down testing to reduce 
COVID numbers. He rushed to 
reopen the economy without ensur-
ing safety measures or a solid plan to 
control the disease. He eliminated a 
White House office set up by the pre-
vious administration to combat pan-
demics and made cuts across other 
areas of the federal government. As a 
result, the U.S. has about seven times 
more COVID deaths than any other 
developed country, and hundreds of 
thousands of lives have been need-

lessly lost. Voting for Trump means 
no end in sight for the pandemic, no 
return to our normal lives any time 
soon, and continued suffering and 
death of Americans. Don’t let the 
(singular) stimulus check fool you. 
As long as there is no COVID plan, 
the economy remains in a state of 
disarray.

Debunking 
Reason 
4: 
The 

Obama 
Administration 
had 

record deportation numbers and 
was notorious for war crimes — 
we don’t want another Democrat 
in office.

In reality, the president has very 

little influence on domestic policy. 
Where he does have a tremendous 
amount of influence, however, is 
foreign policy. And Trump’s foreign 
policy thus far has been disastrous. 
Let’s take the “Middle East peace 
plan” for example — led by Trump’s 
son-in-law, a fervent Israel supporter, 
this plan has an explicit goal of fur-
ther meddling in our countries and 
depleting the Palestinian state even 
more than it already is. Or the fact 
that he encourages American com-
panies to sell bombs to Saudi Arabia 
so they can further destroy Yemen. 
Trump has also passively accom-
modated Turkey’s extension of 
influence into Syria, Iraq, Qatar and 
Libya. He callously strengthened an 
embargo against Iran, so that Per-
sians — regardless of religion — could 
not access medicine for COVID-19 
patients, even threatening to go to 
war with Iran when his poll numbers 
were low. The list goes on and on. 

While Joe Biden’s work and atti-

tude towards the Middle East are 
nothing to applaud, especially dur-
ing the Obama administration which 
saw disastrous effects on Iraq and 
Afghanistan, at this point, there 
is no good option for Arab foreign 
policy. We must assess both of our 
(albeit threatening) options and 
choose the lesser of two evils. Biden 
has called for an end to U.S. support 
for Saudi war in Yemen. While his 
policy towards Israel still errs on the 

side of Zionism, he has been vocal 
in his opposition to annexation of 
the West Bank and his support for a 
two-state solution. The Democratic 
caucus has also discussed condition-
ing the billions of dollars in aid to 
Israel depending on their actions and 
human rights violations. At the end 
of the day, Biden is not particularly a 
friend to Arabs either. But his policies 
leave way more room for growth and 
political pressure, meaning we could 
get more out of his presidency than 
we ever could with Trump. 

Our countries should not be a 

game for American politicians to toy 
with. We deserve agency — the abil-
ity to make our own decisions free 
of foreign interference that does not 
have our best interests at heart. Out 
of both options, Trump certainly 
does not have our best interests at 
heart. 

In conclusion… 
No one’s asking you to pull up a 

seat for everyone yourself. All we’re 
asking is that you scoot over and 
make some space for others. A vote 
for Trump not only prevents your 
POC brothers and sisters from join-
ing you at the table, but it also makes 
your privileged seat all the more pre-
carious. 

Voting is not the answer to all our 

nation’s problems. But it is a place 
to start. We have the power to put 
someone in office who will at least 
try to make things better for us and 
give real activists a foot in the door to 
affect real change. Right now, when 
millions of lives are at stake; when 
the pandemic is still ripping at full 
speed through our nation with no 
sign of relief from the current admin-
istration; when millions of Ameri-
cans are still unemployed or barely 
making it; when our brothers and sis-
ters are being separated, incarcer-
ated and killed; it is not the time to 
be apathetic. Our vote does count, so 
we hope that you show up to the polls 
and vote for Biden.

Zoned out in my 10 a.m. 

ethics class, I was doodling 
with my pen until the profes-
sor said a phrase heard all too 
often: “This is your truth, and 
this is my truth.” As I recali-
brated into the classroom dis-
cussion, I assumed this was 
mainly about being empathet-
ic to different perspectives 
we may confront and gener-
ally thought it made sense. He 
repeated again, “The phrase 
this is your truth and this is 
my truth drives me absolutely 
bonkers.” 

Now I was confused — what’s 

wrong with this seemingly 
harmless idea of holding dif-
ferent viewpoints? He contin-
ued, “There is only one truth 
— one set of facts about every 
situation, crisis and historical 
event. The idea that multiple 
opposing truths can simul-
taneously exist brings about 
the degradation of our sense 
of reality in politics, media 
and everyday life.” Whether 
or not he had put too much 
weight onto a simple phrase, 
the notion stuck with me. No 
one’s ever taken a minute to 
step back and inquire- what 
does that phrase even mean? 
Doesn’t the idea of truth vary-
ing from person to person 
contradict its very essence? 
In today’s day and age, that 
very lack of accountable ques-
tioning may be a contributor 
to what’s made our political 
system what it is now, and 
the implementation of which 
may be a partial solution to 
bringing back a semblance of 
honesty. Amidst the current 
swarm of political rhetoric 

this election season, it seems 
like both parties are capital-
izing on similar grievances 
to attract voters, yet voters 
are more polarized than ever 
before. The same accolades 
are lauded from figures in 
both parties — somehow they 
all lowered the unemploy-
ment rate, they all brought 
jobs back to the United States 
and they all provided Ameri-
cans with the best healthcare, 
education and infrastructure. 
Donald Trump ironically still 
applauds the United States’ 
response to the pandemic, 
claiming we boast “numbers 
better than almost all coun-
tries” — which, when taking 
population sizes into account, 
is exceedingly far from the 
truth: following Chile, Amer-
ica has more cases than any 
other large country as of Aug. 
17. The tendency to spout false 
rhetoric is so normalized and 
undisputed in our politics that 
it often seems as though we’re 
living in a post-truth America. 
Alarmingly, this assumption 
is evidently becoming reality 
with current news headlining 
the idea that a peaceful suc-
cession of power may not hap-
pen following the election.

How did we get here as a 

nation? From the same Unit-
ed States in 2000 in which 
candidate Al Gore encour-
aged citizens to accept the 
highly-contested Bush v. Gore 
results, what brought us to 
the point of suspecting absen-
tee ballots — initially enacted 
through bipartisan efforts — 
of being fraudulent attacks on 
our democracy? The rabbit-
hole of social media seems to 
have contributed largely to 
our tendency to cherry-pick 
sources of information on 

both ends of the spectrum; we 
search for whichever outlet 
can most effectively satiate 
our confirmation bias. Real-
istically, this can’t solely be 
blamed on human psychology, 
but also the innate algorithm 
of many platforms that recali-
brates to present us with the 
most personalized content, 
mainly boiling down to topics, 
politics and groups we already 
know and love. As a society, 
we’ve discussed the caus-
al factors of the post-truth 
world that we live in, but fur-
ther tend to mull over ways 
in which we can combat the 
downward spiral of ‘alterna-
tive facts.’ In the end, it seems 
solely rhetoric will rise above 
the ashes of whatever’s left of 
political accountability in the 
21st century. 

Currently, there are impor-

tant initiatives in place to 
combat the blatant lying we 
see among politicians — live 
fact-checking by reporters, 
fact-check captions at the 
bottom of news broadcasts 
and 
fact-checking 
articles. 

You get the idea — we have 
fact-checking in the armory 
right now. An additional mea-
sure our media must take to 
prevent the degradation of 
truth focuses on the framing 
of questions to political fig-
ures. Journalists must inte-
grate unquestionable truths 
and 
established 
paradigms 

into their questions, leading 
already with an indisputable 
foundation that respondents 
can’t avoid. An example of the 
exact opposite of this recently 
took all news outlets by storm, 
with 
President 
Trump’s 

answer to whether or not he’ll 
commit to a peaceful trans-
fer of power being “There 

won’t be a transfer; frankly, 
there’ll be a continuation.” 
The effect of his response was 
widespread enough for mem-
bers of the Republican party 
(even Mitch McConnell) to 
step back and assure Ameri-
cans otherwise, but the ini-
tial aspect of this exchange is 
what I want to focus on. Why 
is he even being given the 
opportunity to amplify some-
thing so inherently uncon-
stitutional, 
so 
universally 

disavowed, in the first place? 
The conditional phrasing of 
the question gives rise to the 
following response — “will 
you commit” — opening the 
possibility for him not to com-
mit, as he clearly did so. Our 
political system has a lot of 
questionable facets, from the 
electoral college to the per-
missibility of gerrymander-
ing, but the few aspects that 
are unwavering in providing 
legitimacy to our government 
should not be suggested, but 
already implied.

As a child I was a notori-

ously picky eater, disliking 
random food with no rhyme 
or reason, from bell peppers 
to even lasagna (I now look 
back in shock with the lat-
ter). However, every so often 
when lasagna was on the din-
ner table, my mom wouldn’t 
kindly request me to bestow 
the honor of eating her lasa-
gna, but instead ask how I’d 
go about eating what was 
made for dinner — the already 
established 
bottom 
line. 

Today’s political journalists 
may need to follow suit from 
my mom’s techniques, because 
at the end of the day, you could 
be damn sure I sat down with 
that lasagna in my plate, one 
way or the other.

To all Arabs planning on voting for Trump — Don’t

A growing trend has caught the 

attention of U.S. politicians and no, 
it’s not Qanon. It’s the rise in the 
number of Latinx voters, which 
political pundits refer to as the 
Latino Vote. The Latino Vote is an 
elusive creature that many politi-
cians have tried and failed to catch, 
insisting on trapping it, but failing 
to realize that it’s less like a fish and 
more like the Loch Ness Monster: It 
isn’t real. The Latino Vote is a gross 
generalization of Central and South 
Americans that ignores the diver-
sity of thoughts and values within 
such a varied body of people; there 
is no one “Latino Vote.” The narra-
tive perpetuated by the media that 
all Latinx voters vote straight ticket 
blue is incorrect for several reasons 
and harmful to any campaign that 
believes in it. 

My mother and my uncle immi-

grated from Ecuador as children. 
When they moved, they both did not 
know English and went through the 
ESL program in their public school. 
They both attended the University 
of Michigan. Though they had the 
same upbringing and same immi-
grant experience, they could not be 
further apart in ideology. My moth-
er is a moderate, Elizabeth War-
ren type of Democrat. My uncle is a 
raging Independent that responds 
positively towards Trump-like poli-
ticians. After the comments Trump 
made about Mexico sending rapists 
and criminals, I assumed my uncle 
would be offended by the situation. 
He was not. This experience dis-
plays several issues with the myth 
of the Latino Vote. Though there are 
common experiences, such as immi-
gration, ESL and cuisine, Latinx vot-
ers do not always view themselves as 
a uniform group. Rather than iden-
tifying as Latinx, some will refer 
to themselves specifically as Chil-
ean or Puerto Rican. Within these 
identifications, there are values 

held that are not held by the rest of 
the community. For instance, fifty-
eight percent of Cubans identify as 
Republican in comparison to thirty-
eight percent of non-Cuban Hispan-
ics. This disparity can be attributed 
to the issues each group prioritizes; 
according to the Pew Research 
Center, Cuban voters consider for-
eign policy, health care and violent 
crimes more than non-Cuban His-
panics. Foriegn policy is a major 
issue for Cubans, because a hardline 
foreign policy against Cuba means 
that Cubans have a harder time vis-
iting family still on the island. This is 
not as much of a problem with non-
Cuban Latinx as U.S. foreign policy 
with Cuba changes more frequently 
in comparison to other Central and 
South American countries. 

Latinx voters also hold varying 

positions on social issues. Religion 
is an important factor that affects 
voting patterns for the Latino 
Vote. More Latinx Americans are 
actively religious (i.e. going to ser-
vice regularly) as compared to their 
non-Latinx counterparts. Typically 
identifying as Christian, many con-
sider criminalization of abortion to 
be a crucial aspect of the party they 
are voting for; older Latinxs hold 
anti-abortion views to a much larg-
er degree as compared to younger 
Latinxs. This creates a separation 
over this single issue alone. Across 
the board, Latinxs identify as liberal 
significantly more than other non-
Latin Americans and are considered 
equally as accepting of the LGBTQ+ 
community as non-Latin Ameri-
cans. Considering the variation in 
views of these different social issues, 
it is hard to determine what factors 
sway the Latino Vote right or left. 

As we move forward into the 

election cycle, it’s important that 
politicians consider all the over-
sights that come from categorizing 
the Latinx population into one vote. 
As diverse as the community is, the 
views within are even more diverse 
and have the power to greatly 
impact the outcome of the election.

T

hroughout 
the 
country, 

we have seen efforts to 
make voting more difficult, 

many of which target vulnerable 
populations, 
including 
students. 

From the closures of polling places to 
address and ID requirements, these 
efforts emphasize how appreciative 
we should be of Michigan officials 
like Secretary of State Jocelyn 
Benson who have made it easier 
to vote. However, these efforts 
should be the tip of the iceberg. 
With just more than a week until 
the U.S. presidential election, it is 
nothing short of a travesty that the 
University of Michigan hasn’t done 
anything beyond an ambiguous 
one-line reference in a mass email 
to encourage voting. The University 
administration should take many 
actions in the next few days to 
provide its students with valuable 
information related to casting their 
ballots, as described below. 

It’s important to first look at the 

context of voting on campus. In 
2016, only 44.7% of students voted, 
which isn’t a number to dwell on 
but one to build on. However, it is 
hard to say we’re building on that, as 
only approximately 2,600 students 
have registered so far at early voting 
locations on campus and only 2,900 
have voted (according to estimates 
from officials). We have been 
afforded the incredible opportunity 
to not just have the University of 
Michigan Museum of Modern Art 
as an early voting location, but to 

also have drop boxes throughout 

campus where students can place 
their ballots. However, for students to 
vote, they need to have information 

about how and where to vote: What 
should they bring? What did the 
Oct. 19 deadline mean? Can they still 
register if they’re out of state? 

These questions and more could 

be easily answered by an informative 
email sent to every student from 
the University. I encourage the 
University to send out an email 
publicizing the hours, days and 
locations of early voting in Ann Arbor 
(at Ann Arbor City Hall and the 
UMMA), as well as what documents 

are needed to vote. Also crucial is 
a reminder that students can vote 
during the stay-in-place order. This 
information should also be posted 
on the @UMich Twitter, Instagram 
and Facebook accounts, where 
students can both see it and share it. 
Sending all of this information in one, 
easy-to-follow infographic or email 
to every student would cause more 
students to fulfill their civic duty 
and empower students to share this 
information with others. 

I also encourage each department 

to request professors spend 30 
seconds at the beginning of every 
class from now until the election 

providing a reminder about early 
voting. Constant reminders are 
scientifically proven to drive up 
someone’s chance to vote, and this 
is a simple way to do it. Also, in 
synchronous classes, students can 
ask questions in the Zoom chat that 
can be answered on the spot, which 
is much more feasible (and, hopefully, 
more 
reliable) 
than 
students 

searching for these answers on the 
internet where specific, student-
focused information is much harder 
to find. 

It can be argued that this 

information is already out there 
and blasting out another email to 
“go vote” would be futile. However, 
these resources have been promoted 
almost exclusively through the work 
of student organizations and The 
Michigan Daily. Students who are 
not frequently on social media or on 
campus might miss many of these 
reminders. Furthermore, there’s no 
centralized place where students 
can go for information, with much 
of it coming in the form of Instagram 
graphics that tell half the story, or 
leave students with questions but 
no way to answer those questions. 
On top of this, no on-campus 
organization attempting to share 
information has the network, reach 
and influence that the University 
does, whether in a social media post 
or in an email to every student.

Vote yes on Proposals 1 and 2

I

n addition to the candidates on the ballot, Michigan voters will decide 
the fate of two statewide proposals in this year’s election cycle. Proposal 
1 would alter the way that the state of Michigan uses royalties and 

revenue from gas and oil extracted on public lands, directing revenues from 
this practice to conservation efforts and the state park systems. Proposal 2 
is a proposed constitutional amendment, aimed at protecting Michiganders’ 
online data and communications from warrantless search and seizure. 

Voting ‘yes’ on Proposal 1 would 

earmark additional oil and gas 
revenue for the purpose of protecting 
and further developing Michigan’s 
parks. As it currently stands, when 
the State Parks Endowment Fund 
reaches its $800 million cap, any 
additional revenue generated from oil 
and gas extracted from public lands 
would be free for the legislature’s 
unrestricted use. Proposal 1 will 
eliminate the $500 million cap on the 
Natural Resources Trust Fund and 
require that all revenues from oil and 
gas be directed to the NRTF after 
the State Parks Endowment Fund 
reaches its $800 million ceiling. In 
addition, Proposal 1 will specify how 
the funds can be spent requiring 
that at least 20% of the Endowment 
Fund annual spending will go 
toward the improvement of state 
parks, at least 25% of the NRTF’s 
annual spending will go towards 
parks and public recreation areas 
and at least 25 percent of the NRTF’s 
annual spending will go towards the 
conservation of land. 

Proposal 1 is endorsed by a 

multitude of Michigan and national 
environmental 
organizations 

including the Michigan Audubon 
Society, the Michigan NAACP 
Environmental and Climate Justice 
Program and the National Wildlife 
Federation. The Sierra Club is notably 
the only environmental organization 
in opposition, saying that “requiring 
revenue from a non-renewable 
source to go to ongoing, increasing 
funding needs creates financial 
problems, it doesn’t solve them. If we 
are to mitigate climate change, we 
need to protect and preserve land, 
and we need to find new revenue 
sources for the MNRTF as we work 
to get ourselves off of fossil fuels.” 

The Michigan Daily Editorial 

Board wishes to stress that the 
state of Michigan must transition 
away from relying on gas and oil 
revenues to finance parks and 
should not have to tax oil and gas 
companies, those polluting “Pure 
Michigan,” to fund conservation 
efforts. 
Green 
energy 
must 

become a priority to protect the 
environment and create long-
term sustainable jobs in the 
state of Michigan. However, due 
to the reality of park funding 
in this moment and due to the 

requirements Proposal 1 will place 
on the legislature’s delineation of 
revenues raised by the extraction 
of oil and gas on state lands to 
engage in conservation, The Daily 
Editorial Board endorses voting 
“yes” on Proposal 1.

Proposal 2 is a constitutional 

amendment that, according to 
the proposal’s language, would 
“require a search warrant in order 
to access a person’s electronic data 
or 
electronic 
communications.” 

As more of people’s identities and 
personal information is stored 
online, states across the nation 
are beginning to consider similar 
constitutional 
amendments

or legislation. While the U.S. 
Constitution’s 4th Amendment is 
designed to prevent unreasonable 
or 
unwarranted 
searches 
and 

seizures, the 4th Amendment does 
not explicitly include electronic 
data or communication. Voting 
‘yes’ on Proposal 2 would amend 
Michigan’s 
constitution 
to 

explicitly include electronic data 
and communications as requiring 
warrants for law enforcement to 
access.

Bernstein, Ryder Diggs for Regents
W

ith regards to the upcoming University of Michigan’s Board of 
Regents election, The Michigan Daily’s Editorial Board unanimously 
endorses incumbents Mark Bernstein (D) and Shauna Ryder Diggs 

(D). This unanimous decision was by and large the result of how their talking 
points directly concern issues affecting students in the University community 
across all three campuses. There are some key areas where Bernstein and 
Ryder Diggs contrast with the other candidates’ viewpoints on the issues.

Bernstein infamously championed 

the Go Blue Guarantee while voting 
in favor of increasing tuition this 
year — one of his key talking points 
in response to a recent survey. While 
Bernstein claims tuition increases 
only affect those who can already 
afford to pay tuition, there is the 
lingering question of what Bernstein 
means when he says he’s championed 
the Go Blue Guarantee. The board 
noted that expanding the Go Blue 
Guarantee could possibly do more 
to increase affordability for the 
University’s high-quality education. 

However, Bernstein maintains 

he and Ryder Diggs are united in 
favor of “aggressively advanc(ing 
their) 
Democratic 
vision 
for 

affordable, accessible and excellent 
public higher education, while 
embracing diversity, honoring labor 
and protecting the environment.” 
When addressing months of public 
concern about the University’s 
environmental 
impacts 
in 

February, he announced the board 
would freeze any new investments 
in fossil fuels and reevaluate any 
ongoing investments in the same. 

In that meeting, Bernstein also 
advocated for the University’s 
consideration of aligning its capital 
projects with one of its stated long-
term goals — to achieve carbon 
neutrality by the year 2030. 

One possible point of contention 

leading up to the Regents’ election 
is Bernstein’s withdrawal of a $3 
million donation to the Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center 
in 
July 

2016 to prevent the building form 
bearhing his name. Bernstein 
has stated that his decision to 
withdraw the donation was in 
response to concerns expressed 
by members of the University 
community 
— 
concerns 
that 

notably included the fact that the 
Center is the only building on 
campus named after an African 
American (it honors activist and 
newspaper editor William Monroe 
Trotter). Bernstein has stated his 
intention was not to “diminish or 
erase” Trotter’s legacy. 

Ryder Diggs has also discussed 

how she championed the Go Blue 
Guarantee before its inception. 
Further, she’s spoken at length 

about why she’s an advocate for 
its 
expansion, 
citing 
concerns 

about and the importance of the 
University’s affordability. Her own 
experiences with taking out loans to 
afford the University — Ryder Diggs 
attended the University for college, 
medical school and residency — 
as well as her being raised by two 
University professors, have played 
a major role in the formation of 
her views on public education. In 
accordance to her stated views, 
Ryder Diggs voted against the 
recent tuition increase. 

With regards to public comment 

at board meetings, in a December 
2019 
meeting 
where 
Climate 

Action 
Movement 
and 
One 

University 
members 
expressed 

their frustrations due to a lack of 
response to their concerns, Ryder 
Diggs was the only regent to 
respond to them directly. She noted 
the board does take into account 
public comment and sympathized 
with their positions.

Vote Debbie Dingell and Gary Peters
T

he race for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for 
Michigan’s 12th congressional district is effortlessly dominated 
by incumbent Dingell. Closely tied to the University of Michigan’s 

campus, Dingell was one of the politicians who vocally endorsed the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 
Organization’s 
strikes 
earlier 
this 
semester.

The pandemic, the loss of her 

husband and presidential attacks 
bringing 
nationwide 
attention 

have not hindered her work to 
improve the state of Michigan 
— she persisted in her steadfast 
advocacy for the Coronavirus 
Aid, 
Relief 
and 
Economic 

Security Act and the Payment 
Protection Program and Health 
Care Enhancement Act. Prior to 
the pandemic, she exemplified 
her support for union workers by 
joining the United Auto Workers 
strikes in 2019, pressuring General 
Motors to raise wages, narrow the 
pay gap between new and veteran 
workers and reopen closed plants. 

Dingell believes that every 

American has the right to health 
care, 
values 
the 
automotive 

industry and its contributions to 
Michigan’s economy and supports 
the 
Great 
Lakes 
Restoration 

Initiative which protects our 
freshwater lakes from pollution, 
invasive 
species 
and 
other 

impacts of climate change. She 
has also supported the Bipartisan 
Background Checks Act of 2019, 
closing important loopholes in 
purchasing firearms and leading 
the Zero Tolerance for Domestic 
Abusers 
Act, 
which 
further 

prevents domestic abusers from 
obtaining firearms. Due to her 
history 
of 
relentless 
support 

for issues critical to Michigan’s 
prosperity, the Michigan Daily 
Editorial Board is proud to 
endorse Dingell. 

Opponent 
Jeff 
Jones 
is 

challenging Dingell for the third 
time, yet still lacks any semblance 
of 
the 
political 
stronghold 

necessary to win the race. His only 
online presence is his Facebook 
page, which fails to describe what 
his platform is for this election. In 
miscellaneous posts answering 
constituent questions, he has 
expressed his disbelief in the 
science 
behind 
mask-wearing 

and most of the public health 
measures implemented to mitigate 

the spread of COVID-19. Jones 
is anti-abortion in a state that is 
already in grave danger if Roe v. 
Wade is overturned. His chances 
of winning the election are 
negligible, making Dingell almost 
guaranteed to be victorious. 

Gary Walkowicz is running for 

the U.S. House of Representatives 
seat for the fourth consecutive 
election cycle, but without any 
preconception that he will actually 
win the election. After running 
as an independent in 2014, he 
successfully petitioned for the 
Working Class Party to be put on 
the ballot and subsequently ran 
under the Working Class Party in 
2016, 2018 and 2020. He is firmly 
against the two-party system 
and believes that no party can 
adequately represent the working 
class besides the working class 
themselves. 

***
There are many reasons why 

The Michigan Daily Editorial 
Board stands firmly in its support 
of the reelection of Sen. Peters, 
D-Mich., but one of the most 
prominent is the unqualified 
candidate against whom he is 
running: Detroit businessman 
John James. James, who was 
defeated 
by 
incumbent 
Sen. 

Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., in 
2018, is running as an outsider, 
despite his presence as a fixture 
in 
Michigan 
politics 
dating 

back to 2014, and despite his 
campaign receiving $9 million 
from a super PAC led by allies 
of 
Senate 
Majority 
Leader 

Mitch 
McConnell, 
R-Ky. 
He 

was considered by President 
Donald Trump as a candidate to 
replace Nikki R. Haley, former 
ambassador 
to 
the 
United 

Nations, in 2018, but the position 
ultimately 
went 
to 
Trump 

megadonor Kelly Craft. 

That James is Peters’s opponent 

is in and of itself enough to warrant 
casting your ballot for the latter. 
While Peters keeps his head down, 

passing legislation and working on 
behalf of his constituents, James 
has boasted that he is “2000%” 
for Trump. The Senate has its 
share of avid right-wing Trump 
supporters; it does not need 
another. Much like Michigan, the 
Senate needs a man like Peters, the 
third most bipartisan Democratic 
senator of the 116th (and current) 
Congress. The last thing Michigan 
needs is to add to the Senate a man 
like James, who equates abortion 
rights to genocide or who is 
endorsed by the NRA, when, as of 
July, non-fatal shootings in Detroit 
have increased by a factor of 52% 
since 2019. 

James is another Republican 

military veteran who distorts 
and exploits his military record 
for political gain. James claims to 
have been an Army Ranger, but he 
never served in the 75th Ranger 
Regiment of the United States 
Army. James served honorably in 
the U.S. Army for eight years; his 
discharge tells us as much. That he 
still feels the need to embellish 
his record begs the question: If he 
feels the need to mislead Michigan 
voters about his own record, 
how can we trust him to tell his 
constituents 
the 
truth 
about 

matters that affect them? 

At a time when Michigan 

needs a decent, hard-working 
senator who understands the 
challenges faced by Michigan 
families, the GOP has nominated 
a man who is self-serving, 
propped up by DeVos, Koch and 
McConnell super PAC money 
and 
supportive 
of 
policies 

that would further divide our 
communities and our country. 
That James opposes the death 
penalty is not enough to excuse 
his other stances — while Peters 
has not taken a firm stance on 
the death penalty since joining 
Congress in 2009, he also doesn’t 
hold a series of other problematic 
views or lie repeatedly about his 
record.

I

n 2016, just four years shy of the hun-

dred-year anniversary of the ratifica-

tion of the 19th amendment, Ameri-

cans witnessed history as the first woman ever 

was nominated as a presidential candidate by 

a major political party.

 America also saw her lose, and for many, 

it was all hell breaking loose. Never mind the 

apparent misogynist who was her opponent, 

many Americans were heartbroken and hope-

less seeing a woman rise so high, reaching a 

place where no woman had been allowed to 

ascend before, only to be rebuffed so brazenly 

and with such hostility. On top of the heart-

break of coming so close to making history 

and breaking one of the last intact glass ceil-

ings, many were fearful of what the next four 

years would look like — and rightfully so. 

On election night 2016, I tried my best to 

stay awake, even as moods darkened when 

supposedly blue-leaning swing states swung 

red. Even then, as I drifted off to sleep, there 

was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I 

was finally going to see a woman elected as 

the president of the United States, and thank-

fully, one who was guided by feminist prin-

ciples and advocated for progressive policies. 

When I woke up the next morning, my heart 

sank into my stomach and my throat felt like 

it was closing; like so many women and oth-

er marginalized people, I knew exactly how 

high the stakes really were. 

It was devastating, soul-crushing and 

deeply distressing. 

Now, nearly four years later, there is once 

again a woman making history at the top of 

the ballot. On Aug. 11, former vice president 

Joe Biden selected Sen. Kamala Harris, D-

Calif., as his running mate. Introducing her 

at their first press conference together as his 

ticket’s vice president, Biden said, “One of the 

reasons that I chose Kamala is that we both 

believe that we can define America simply in 

one word: possibilities.” 

Even before any vote is cast, Harris’s nomi-

nation is historic: She is the both the first 

Black woman and the first Indian woman to 

be nominated for vice president by a major 

political party. If Biden is elected president, 

she will be the first woman to serve in one of 

the highest roles in our nation as the first fe-

male vice president. 

Nodding toward this legacy, Biden also 

said, “This morning, all across the nation, 

little girls woke up, especially little Black and 

brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and 

undervalued in their communities. But today 

just maybe they’re seeing themselves for the 

first time in a new way: as the stuff of presi-

dents and vice presidents.” 

In an effort to understand the impact of 

Harris’s nomination, I spoke to several Uni-

versity of Michigan students about their 

thoughts on Biden choosing Harris to be his 

running mate and what her vice presidency 

might mean. 

In an email to The Michigan Daily, Jake 

Riegel, an LSA sophomore studying American 

Culture and a member of Students for Biden 

on campus, wrote about what Biden’s selec-

tion shows. 

“... The Democratic Party is proving itself 

to be the party of diversity and inclusion,” Rie-

gel wrote. “I do feel more excited (to vote for 

Joe Biden), because Senator Harris was my 

preferred vice presidential candidate.” 

Riegel also commented on the historic na-

ture of her candidacy.

“It is significant that Joe Biden picked Ka-

mala Harris, both because she is Black and 

South Asian, as well as a woman, but I am 

more excited because of her qualifications. 

She is ultimately qualified for both the posi-

tion as vice president and president.” 

While many are excited about the progress 

Harris’s nomination means for women in poli-

tics, others are a bit more cautious. LSA fresh-

man Eva Hale, also a member of Students for 

Biden, touched on this idea in an interview. 

“A woman still hasn’t been elected (as pres-

ident), and if Joe and Kamala win, she still 

wouldn’t have been elected,” Hale said. “The 

fact that a lot of women were competitive for 

the presidential nomination this year is great 

— I guess it shows we’re getting there, but we 

can’t say we’re there yet.”

While Harris’s nomination makes her a 

trailblazer for women’s political representa-

tion, she is not, however, the first woman to 

be nominated as a vice presidential running 

mate. In fact, there have been two women be-

fore her who were selected to be on a major 

party ticket. The stories of these two women’s 

nominations could not be more different, but 

the country’s reaction to them provides im-

portant context for Harris’s nomination and 

potential election. 

In 1984, then-Congresswoman Geraldine 

Ferraro, a Democrat from New York, was se-

lected by Walter Mondale to be his running 

mate. Before this selection, Ferraro, a former 

schoolteacher and sex crimes prosecutor, 

quickly rose in the Democratic party’s lead-

ership, becoming the Secretary of the House 

Democratic Caucus. 

It was not long before she faced misog-

yny on the campaign trail. On top of sex-

ist coverage about her clothes and her hair, 

she was asked by a voter if she could bake a 

blueberry muffin because “down here in Mis-

sissippi the men don’t cook.” On Meet the 

Press, one moderator questioned whether she 

could push the nuclear button and if Mondale 

would have chosen her if she weren’t a wom-

an. Articles were written asking if America 

was “ready” for a female vice president, some-

thing pundits continue to ask to this day, just 

as they asked if America was ready for a Black 

president when then-Senator Obama ran in 

2008. 

The sexism didn’t only come from the 

press; it also came from her opponent’s cam-

paign: Vice President Bush’s spokesperson, 

Peter Teeley, said, “She’s too bitchy. She’s 

very arrogant. Humility isn’t one of her strong 

points, and I think that comes through.” 

Ambitious women frequently receive these 

sorts of remarks from men like Teeley — men 

who view women who dare to step out of their 

socially-constructed place with contempt and 

vitriol. 

Indicative of the tightrope she was forced 

to walk as a woman vying for one of the high-

est offices in the land, Ferrero often referred 

to herself as “a housewife from Queens.” She 

could not be too openly ambitious. She need-

ed to be careful not to be perceived as threat-

ening the status quo of men holding almost 

all political power. She could not even defend 

herself against sexist attacks; in 2008, she re-

flected on the experience saying, “In 1984, I 

couldn’t say, ‘Stop it,” because I couldn’t look 

like I was whining or upset about it.” 

On top of the criticism she faced solely as 

a result of being a woman, Ferraro’s nomina-

tion, while historic, was essentially doomed 

from the beginning. Trailing Reagan, Mondale 

decided he needed to shake up the race by 

picking a female running mate, an effort to 

clinch the excitement of Democratic voters. 

The effort failed, though, in part due to Mon-

dale’s own strategic blunders, resulting in the 

Mondale-Ferraro ticket only winning 13 elec-

toral votes in the Electoral College.

While Mondale’s own candidacy was ill-

fated from the beginning due to the country 

experiencing short-term economic growth 

from the Reagan-era tax cuts, picking a wom-

an to be your running mate as a last-ditch ef-

fort to save your candidacy is nothing to be 

applauded. It is objectifying and indicates a 

level of contempt for women voters by think-

ing that they will rush to your side for picking 

a lady to be on the ticket. 

And yet, 24 years later, another woman was 

selected as a vice presidential running mate 

for the same reason: Sarah Palin.

In 2008, then-Senator and candidate John 

McCain selected Palin to be his running mate, 

though his first-choice pick was Joe Lieber-

man, a centrist from Connecticut. He ulti-

mately picked then-Governor of Alaska Sarah 

Palin because, as one GOP strategist said, he 

“clearly felt like (the campaign) needed to 

shake this race up and go for broke.” Picking a 

woman to be his running mate as a Republican 

nominee certainly raised eyebrows, but also 

initially elicited positive feedback, with Mc-

Cain’s campaign receiving a bit of a boost in 

the aftermath of this selection. 

Again, though, Palin was set up to fail. At 

the time of the pick, McCain was consistently 

trailing behind Obama in polling, dragged 

down for his party association with Bush as 

the economy barreled toward collapse in the 

fall of 2008. McCain needed a splashy pick to 

try to bring some enthusiasm and new inter-

est to his campaign. 

On top of tasking her with saving his de-

clining candidacy, McCain thrust Palin into 

the spotlight with relatively little vetting and 

preparedness. Of course, as a governor, there 

was little excuse as to why Palin could not 

name a single newspaper or magazine she 

regularly read in a now-famous interview 

with Katie Couric, where she said she read 

“all of them, any of them.” 

Still, the McCain campaign famous-

ly failed to fully vet Palin as they had scram-

bled to find a pick after several other candi-

dates fell through, using her as less of an equal 

partner or colleague and more as a shiny new 

toy to dazzle voters and the press. 

Despite the time between Ferraro’s histo-

ry-making nomination and Palin joining Mc-

Cain’s ticket, female candidates were still sub-

ject to similar instances of sexism by the media 

and voters on the campaign trail. In reflection 

on the 2008 campaign, which also included 

Hillary Clinton’s first presidential run, Fer-

raro said, “Even when (the media was) so sex-

ist to Hillary, and we said something about it, 

they still thought we were whining or acting 

like sore losers ... But I never thought we’d 

have the opportunity to see another woman 

go through it, this same election cycle, after 

the press had been put on notice,” referencing 

when Charlie Gibson of ABC News asked Pal-

in how somebody could manage a family of 

seven and the vice presidency. 

It is true that one’s political party rarely 

protects female candidates from sexist cov-

erage or attacks, but a female candidate’s 

political party, particularly due to the policy 

preferences she holds, are decisive in de-

termining whether her election is a victory 

for women and for feminism. Though some 

who are not particularly well-read on femi-

nist scholarship will claim the election of a 

woman — any woman — automatically means 

progress for women’s rights, this assertion is 

deeply misguided and factually wrong. The 

election of Sarah Palin, an anti-choice, far-

right Republican, would not have been a win 

for women. As vice president, she would 

have advocated for positions in the McCain 

administration that would have systemati-

cally stripped women, as well as other mar-

ginalized groups, of their rights and liberties, 

particularly on issues of reproductive justice, 

voting rights, environmental justice and eco-

nomic justice. 

Women’s political interests are only ben-

efitted when women who will work toward 

gender equality and autonomy are elected.

A moment of

M

y father jumped out of his seat 

the moment I entered the living 

room. With a glowing smile, he 

proudly announced that he had finished register-

ing to vote for the upcoming presidential election. 

Each day that followed, whenever I trekked to 

the mailbox and dropped our mail on the table, he 

would shuffle through the array of letters, hoping 

to find his absentee ballot. 

My father became a United States citizen 

approximately 25 years ago. He first landed in 

Canada after moving from Vietnam, and then re-

located to Michigan after meeting my mom at a 

friend’s wedding. Despite this, he had never fully 

engaged in U.S. politics, and instead focused more 

on his profession and building a life for his family. 

He usually tuned in to NBC Nightly News after 

dinner to stay up-to-date with current events, but 

his engagement ended with the closing segment. 

I always secretly hoped he’d grow more inter-

ested in current events, but I understood he was 
extremely stressed from the pressures of work. 

After moving back home from college in 

March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I noticed 

a shift in the political atmosphere in my home. 

Over the two and a half years I had been away, my 

father had developed his own voice. I watched 

as he tried to converse with David Muir through 

the monitor, exclaiming “what do you mean?” or 

“how could this happen?” Instead of passively 

listening like he did in the past, he was fervently 

engaged. I was filled with pride as I watched my 

father sit on the edge of his seat, waiting to hear 

what the news anchor would say next. 

While moving back home and seeing this 

change was exciting, that time period was also 

marked by anxiety. The pandemic is no joke for 

my family. My father has a preexisting condition, 

and when I moved back home, we couldn’t fath-

om engaging in behavior that would put him at 

risk. We wore masks like it was our armor from 

the deadly virus and scrubbed doorhandles clean 

with Clorox wipes. After every trip to the grocery 

store, my mother and I would come home with 

mountains of food to limit the number of times 

we went out. My father was absolutely ecstatic 

when Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Ben-

son assured Michigan residents could vote by 

mail. As Benson said, he thankfully didn’t have to 

worry about choosing between his health and his 

right to vote.

Our ballots coincidentally arrived on the same 

day. My father’s face lit up with excitement as 

he took his ballot to his home office with a pen 

in hand. He was determined to exercise his right 

as a newly informed, engaged U.S. citizen. Fifteen 

minutes later, he emerged victorious with a com-

pleted ballot, sealing it up and placing it back in 

the mailbox to be shipped off the next day.

It was official. My father — an immigrant with 

a preexisting condition — voted for the first time 

ever. 
2

016 hit a record breaking 200 mil-

lion total registered voters, yet only 

61.4% voted. According to the Pew Re-

search Center, 15% of registered nonvoters iden-

tified a “lack of interest or a feeling that their vote 

wouldn’t make a difference” as the reason for not 

voting. Surely one vote can’t make a difference — 

at least that’s what my father used to think.

And yet, a single vote can. 

NPR details close calls in election history, 

including an incident in 2017 in Virginia. In an 

election for a seat in the House of Delegates, a 

tie was broken by placing the candidate’s names 

in a canister and picking one out. A more well-

known example is the 2000 elections when Al 

Gore lost the electoral college to George W
. Bush 

due to a narrow 0.009 margin in Florida.

It might not seem like your vote matters, but 

that’s what hundreds of other people are think-

ing, too. That’s what my father thought at first. 

Imagine the power if all these voices spoke to-

gether instead of staying silent. Our democracy 

only works if everyone plays their part. We can’t 

assume someone else will fight our battles, and 

if there is a cause that you believe in, you need to 

vote to help uplift the voices of those who can’t. 

We can only create progress if we continue to 

fight for what we believe in. 

In terms of elections, every vote is key when 

deciding each state’s electoral college votes. 

Out of 50 states, 48 utilize the winner-takes-all 

system. The system itself is highly controversial, 

with people arguing it is anti-democratic and it 

waters down the value of a single vote. However, 

these controversies demonstrate that’s all the 

more reason why your vote matters. We need to 

continue fighting and not use these controversies 

as an excuse. Hillary Clinton lost the electoral 

college in 2016 despite winning the popular vote, 

costing her the presidency as a direct result of 

this phenomena. Regardless of which side you 

fall on the political spectrum, the close nature of 

Clinton-Trump and Gore-Bush elections demon-

strate the power of the electoral college.

Even more important are battleground states, 

also known as swing states. Battleground states 

teeter between red and blue party affiliations 

during election seasons, and are usually watched 

closely by news organizations trying to map elec-

tion results. Politico has identified Georgia, Ari-

zona, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, North Caro-

lina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as swing states 

for the upcoming election. These states were 

also identified as swing states in the 2016 election. 

Since we live in Michigan, my father and I both 

know that our vote will be critical in determining 

what color Michigan will appear on the map, and 

in turn, decide who will receive Michigan’s elec-

toral college votes.

This year, the U.S. has already beaten 2016’s 

record of early voting by 140%. While I agree the 

numbers are shocking, I’m also not surprised. 

Every time I open up social media, my feed 

is flooded with voting initiatives. My friends post 

on Instagram and Snapchat flaunting their vot-

ing stickers. It seems to me like this election cycle 

is generating a powerful push to increase voter 

turnout, a push greater than ever before. 

There’s no denying that 2020 has been jam-

packed with political discourse. The world was 

pushed into a new reality as COVID-19 wreaked 

havoc, disrupting our daily lives. Following the 

death of George Floyd, national news organiza-

tions broadcasted protestors flooding streets 

across the country as brave voices stood strong 

for the Black Lives Matter movement. Our coun-

try lost Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Gins-

burg, a women’s rights pioneer and icon, creating 

a vacant seat on the Supreme Court. The legiti-

macy of absentee voting itself has been battled by 

politicians. 

There is so much at stake, now more than ever. 

That’s why my father is voting — he knows his 

vote can make a difference. But it’s important to 

note that he can make a difference in any election, 

not just this one. 

This incredible push for exercising our voting 

rights shouldn’t end at the 2020 election. Every 

new administration, and all of the changes in 

positions beside the presidency that each cycle 

brings, creates lasting effects on our lives. We live 

in a continuously changing world, and different 

economic and social issues will constantly be in 

flux. There will always be something for us to 

voice our opinions on, and voting for a candidate 

you believe in can be a tangible method to initiate 

change. 

We need to recognize that voting is an in-

credible privilege that was heavily fought for in 

the U.S. and around the world. We are fortunate 

to have a say in our government and we must 

keep exercising our rights rather than rendering 

them obsolete. 

With this upcoming election, I’ve watched my 

father transform before my eyes. I’ve never seen 

him this passionate about politics, or this excited 

to vote. He left his home country in search for a 

better life — a life with more freedom and op-

portunities. Now, 25 years later, he gets to play a 

direct part in our democracy.

E

very morning I wake up and realize 

that we’re one day closer to the gen-

eral election on Nov. 3. Whether it be 

from a New York Times notification or a new 

mark on my calendar, the start to each morning 

feels like a ticking time bomb. With each con-

scious realization of Election Day’s proximity 
comes an unavoidable pit of anxiety. This un-

easiness is not foreign to me; in fact, it’s a feeling 
that I’ve felt before — four years ago, to be exact.

It’s what my therapist likes to call political 

anxiety. To me, it feels more like political deja 

vu. 

On the surface, it makes sense that emo-

tions similar to those I was experiencing in the 

fall of 2016 are reemerging now. After all, both 

2016 and 2020 are election years, and they both 

involve the ruthless presidential campaign — 

filled with misogyny, xenophobia and racism 

— of Donald Trump. But the most unsettling 

similarity between the 2016 and 2020 

election is internal; my thoughts, feel-

ings and anxieties suddenly feel eerily 

familiar to those I had four years ago.

Let me explain.

In the fall of 2016, I was an overly-

ambitious, tired-eyed 16-year-old with 

a growing interest in politics. My par-

ents have always been vocal political 

junkies, conditioning my brother and I 

to adopt the same interest in the topic. 

I followed this passion throughout my 

high school career: I was the president 

of our Model Congress club, vice presi-

dent of the Political Debate Forum and 

editor of the Millburn Observer — the 

high school’s political newspaper. That 

fall, I was enrolled in what would be-

come the best class I have ever taken, 

college included: AP Government and 

Politics (GoPo, for short), taught by Mr. 

Raymond. 

Mr. Raymond would regularly de-

vote parts of class to analysis of the 

year’s election. He never disclosed his 

party affiliation or personal beliefs, 

and instead offered us objective and 

detailed examinations of debates, his-

torical trends and news coverage. He 

taught us how to both properly listen 

to and process information from me-

dia outlets. This meant identifying 

bias and drawing conclusions based on 

evidence, whether the source be Fox 

News, MSNBC or CNN. 

I had never been both so knowledge-

able about and immersed in American 

politics. I valued Mr. Raymond’s les-

sons more than any course before: I would spend 

hours after school every weekday rereading my 

class notes, jotting down individual analysis 

and later referencing them when engaging in 

out-of-classroom debates. I began reading Real-

ClearPolitics and Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight 

every day. I watched the news from stations that 

leaned politically in both directions, whether it 

be delivered by Rachel Maddow or Chris Wal-

lace. I researched ways I could get involved in 

my own community, which led me to canvas and 

phone-bank for the Clinton campaign. 

I was always a Hillary Clinton supporter, 

but I was also extremely disgusted by Trump’s 

behavior. This disgust morphed into a grenade 

of anger following the 2016 October Surprise, 

when an Access Hollywood video was released 

of Trump telling then-reporter Billy Bush to 

“grab ‘em (women) by the pussy.” I cried to my 

dad as I watched the video, hearing a presiden-

tial candidate glorify, explicitly participate in 

and perpetuate rape culture. I couldn’t remain 

silent anymore. I quickly grabbed my computer, 

locked myself in my room and wrote a piece ti-

tled “An Open Letter to Donald Trump,” plead-

ing for people not to vote for him. 

I couldn’t imagine a world in which Trump 

was president.

But four years later, here we are. The simi-

larities from then to now are almost uncanny. I 

am a junior in college now, continuing studying 

my civic interests through a major in political 
science. I channel my anxiety into Get Out the 

Vote efforts, studying and planning how to in-
crease voter turnout in a course called “POLSCI 

389: Detroit Votes” or through phone-banking 

independently. While I am no longer Mr. Ray-

mond’s student, I still keep in touch with him 

via email. I still learn from his analysis when 

I feel too overwhelmed to adequately sort out 

my thoughts. I have been tracking the prog-

ress of the 2020 general election since the 

summer of 2019, still relying on RealClearPoli-

tics and FiveThirtyEight for political news. I 

still write about politics as a form of catharsis. 

I am just as, if not even more, scared for 

another Trump term as I was before. The po-

litical instability in the United States combined 

with little effort to control the pandemic right 

now is dangerous. Our country is in an extreme-

ly volatile state, and I am at a loss for ideas when 

I try to think about what else I can do about it 

beside traditional GOTV efforts. I’ve been rack-

ing my brain about this for a while, as the situ-

ation gets more pressing with each news bite. 

And while canvassing can be effective, I can’t 

help but feel an undeniable sense of dread 

when envisioning Election Day because I can-

not guarantee my desired outcome. 

My anxiety paints Election Day up as sort of 

political Armageddon. How could it not when 

the president has actively tried to suppress 

voter turnout, all while claiming he won’t con-

cede if he loses. And if it’s anything like 2016, I 

cannot get my hopes up only to be let down. 

Though I try to forget, I remember that day 

like it was yesterday. 
N

ov. 8, 2016 was a day the country 

long anticipated. I had been fol-

lowing the polls, and while they 

were swaying in favor of Clinton, they were 

creeping dangerously close to the margin of 

error. Still, I tried my best to maintain a cau-

tiously optimistic perspective. That afternoon, 

I drove an hour and a half away from my home-

town with my mom and a friend of mine to go 

door-to-door canvassing in Bethlehem, PA — a 
swing city in a notorious swing state. We knew 

we had to get out the vote on the day that mat-
tered most. 

We drove back home around 5 p.m., mak-

ing it back in time for my political debate club’s 

election party. A mix of 20 juniors and seniors 

met at a club member’s house to eat good food, 

make predictions and hopefully celebrate our 

country’s first female president. Mostly every-

one there was a Hillary supporter, with the ex-

ception of one or two Trump supporters.

We ate goldfish and crackers while drinking 

sparkling apple cider, packed together on the 

couch and floor. We switched between news 

outlets in an attempt to get bipartisan coverage. 

Adrenaline filled the air as the results flooded 

back in, at first reporting positive signs. We 

were laughing and gossiping, unaware of what 

was to come. 

Suddenly, the returns from Florida started 

to tip in Trump’s favor. Dangerous. The room 

started to get a bit quieter, beside the over-

whelming joy coming from the Trump support-

ers. Most of us were very tense, sitting with our 

fists clenched as fear crept into our minds. 

He could win this thing. 

The betting odds on FiveThirtyEight re-

freshed to hit a new high — 80% in favor of 

Trump. I emailed my teacher on behalf of the 18 

of us, nervously typing:

“When should we start crying? We are pray-

ing for a miracle. Eighteen of your students are 

already in shambles, including me. We saw the 

latest 538 poll, and we are unstable.”

And as soon as it started to look like he was 

going to win Wisconsin, my friend Arik started 

his application into McGill, a university in Can-

ada — an action symbolizing his newfound de-

sire to leave the country. 

The fear grew stronger with each return 

update. It was getting late, and the situation 

was only getting worse by the second. Around 

11:15 p.m., I had my best friend Kyle drive me 

home — I didn’t want to cry in front of my 

peers. 

In the car, I got a CNN update that Trump 

had won Wisconsin. That put him over the 
edge of winning the Electoral College, and 

I knew it. I told Kyle to pull over as we ap-

proached a spot in our town that overlooks 

New York City. It’s usually a place of comfort 

for him and I, showing us how small we are 

on the grand scale of things. Tonight was dif-

ferent, though. Everything felt huge and scary. 

Once he put his car in park, he took a deep 

breath and looked at me. I began to weep. Ev-

erything we had fought for, everything we had 

hoped for was at risk. People’s rights were at 

risk. People’s lives were at risk. And 

instead of bigotry receiving its de-

served ending — defeat — Trump was 

being rewarded for his dehuman-

izing, vulgar, oppressive behavior. I 

looked at the city in front of me but 

could barely see out of my teary eyes. 

Even as Kyle held my hand and told 

me it would be OK, I didn’t know how 

it could be. 

After 10 minutes, Kyle dropped 

me off at home. The only possibil-

ity of Hillary coming back was with 

a deadlock. I once again emailed Mr. 

Raymond, holding onto any small 

shred of hope I had left. 

“There’s no chance even with 

Michigan?”

His reply said it all:

“Go to bed.”
I 

don’t talk about that day often. 

It hurts too much to relive it. I 

tried to piece the details back 

together as well as I could remem-

ber it, reaching out to Kyle to fill the 

gaps I missed. When texting him for 

answers, he responded with a suc-

cinct but all-telling “i’m sorry hahaha 

i blocked too much of that out.” It 

seems a lot of us did. 

As much as I’d like to forget the 

darkness of that night, its effects lin-

ger everyday with the aftermath of 

living under a Trump presidency. 

Multiple sexual assault allegations. 

An impeachment. Continuous sup-

port of hate groups. Xenophobic leg-

islation. The furthering of a white na-

tionalist agenda. Dehumanizing, disgraceful 

rhetoric. Perpetual lies. Science denial. Crimi-

nalizing dissent. A failure to acknowledge or 

handle a global pandemic. A catalyst of hun-

dreds of thousands of innocent deaths. 

This is just the beginning — I can’t even try 

to create an all-encompassing list of the un-

acceptable things Trump has done in the last 

four years. The rage and distress I feel is in-

describable. And the anxiety surrounding the 

upcoming election is unavoidable. A weight of 

helplessness lies on my shoulders as I wait for 

Nov. 3, praying to anyone and anything that 

we vote him out.

It would be easy to give into those feelings, 

especially when it felt like all of my efforts to 

elect Hillary in 2016 were done for nothing. 

But I know that’s the attitude that results in 

complacency. We must keep pushing, even 

when at our most cynical. I may not be opti-

mistic, but I believe in actionable change. I 

will do everything in my power to help shape 

a better future.

Election Day 2020 needs to end differently 

than it did in 2016.

We’ve been through this before: 
When 2020 feels like 2016


W

hen it comes to voting 

and elections the most 

common question any-

one gets is: Who are you voting for? 

Yet, reading the breaking news head-

lines every morning, watching the 

Climate Clock in New York City tick, 

hearing of Justice Ruth Bader Gins-

burg’s death or living through the on-

going COVID-19 pandemic, I am re-

minded of the importance of using my 

vote as a means of advocacy and voice 

in this election. 

While filling out my absentee bal-

lot I found myself not thinking about 

who I am voting for, but rather what 

I am voting for. I am voting for poli-

cies that don’t place a monetary value 

on human life. I am voting for the be-

lief in science — to save our planet and 

the lives of so many Americans amid a 

pandemic. I am voting for a woman’s 

right to choose. 

I cannot talk about women’s rights 

without briefly mentioning RBG’s leg-

acy and the confirmation of the new 

SCOTUS, the former United States 

federal judge Amy Coney Barett. RBG 

was a champion of women’s equality, 

along with many other progressive 

ideals. RBG particularly advocated 

for women’s rights, seen specifical-

ly when she continuously protected 

the precedent established in Roe v. 

Wade — the right to an abortion — dur-

ing future cases that may have poten-

tially threatened the ruling. In Roe v. 

Wade, the court framed the right to an 

abortion as a matter of privacy. Even 

though RBG was not on the court at 

the time of this decision, she cleverly 

and accurately framed her opinion on 

the case as a matter of gender equality, 

rather than privacy. 

Even though overturning a Su-

preme Court case is both highly un-

likely and challenging, more recently, the 

possibility of overturning Roe v. Wade has 

become reality. With RBG’s death leaving 

a vacant seat in the Supreme Court of the 

United States, the intersection between 

the election and the battle over the va-

cant Supreme Court seat surfaced. While 

Republicans pushed to fill the seat be-

fore the election, Democrats argued that 

we are in the midst of an election, and 

the seat should not have been filled un-

til after the Presidential election. Demo-

crats plead that with the new SCOTUS 

nominee nearly half a century of legal 

precedent has the potential to be over-

turned — the right to choose, the right 

to vote, dreamers who are risked of be-

ing expelled from the only country they 

have ever known, union workers who are 

at risk of losing their right to collectively 

bargain. Democrats plead that because 

millions of Americans have already cast 

their ballots, they deserve to have their 

voices heard. 

Did President Trump think appointing 

an attractive young woman will indemnify 

the loss of RBG? President Trump’s deci-

sion to nominate Amy Coney Barrett was 

strategic: Put a woman on the Supreme 

Court to fill RBG’s seat to appear progres-

sive and equate her role. Maybe it would 

be if Barrett could follow, or even more 

importantly enhance, RBG’s legacy. How-

ever, Amy Coney Barrett will do just the 

opposite. Amy Coney Barrett’s confirma-

tion means two things: The court will shift 

to a 6-3 conservative majority, and the po-

tential of Roe v. Wade to be overturned is 

real — as a law professor Judge Barrett 

was a member of an anti-abortion group, 

Faculty for Life, where she expressed her 

skepitcism for the decision and her will-

ingness to revisit the case. 

I found myself asking what this means 

with an election around the corner, and 

the answer came all too quickly: As a 

woman, my rights are on the ballot.

I was curious about what students of 

different identities than mine would say 

in response to the same question. How-

ever, I was surprised to find a common 

denominator in the responses from every-

one I spoke to: While all these students 

are voting for something, they are fore-

mostly voting against something. 

For LSA junior Katharine Boasberg, 

this election means voting against hate 

and ignorance. In a phone interview with 

The Daily, Boasberg explained that the 

fact that “Black Lives Matter” is political 

speaks to the value we put on human life, 

or lack thereof. 

“We don’t value the lives of women, 

minorities or poor people. All we value 

are the lives of the people already in pow-

er,” Boasberg said. “Because morality has 

been politicized, we are fighting a battle 

against humanity and hate.”

Due to this, Boasberg said that “[she] is 

voting against using race, gender and so-

cio-economic status as a means of putting 

a level of value on human life.” 

Similarly, Ross junior Oliver Ginns 

stated that this election means “voting 
against divisiveness, against a lack of em-

pathy and, most importantly, for human 

decency,” in a phone interview with The 

Daily. 

To LSA senior Alexa Bates, this elec-

tion means voting against the rhetoric of 

hate. In a phone interview with The Dai-

ly, Bates explained that she is aware hate 

will not necessarily go away just because 

of a change in office. Nonetheless, she is 

voting to “take away the power and au-

thority that gives people the notion that 

hate is OK.” 

For some, voting represents a depar-

ture from their past education or fam-

ily life; it allows for largely autonomous 

decision-making in the face of difficult 

policy points.

In a phone interview, LSA junior Alli-

son Gonzalez said that this election means 

voting against what she was indoctrinated 

to believe in her previous education of at-

tending an all girls Catholic school. For 

Gonzalez’s whole education, she has been 

taught that Roe v. Wade should be over-

turned. Now, however, she can make her 

own decision.

“I began to be critical about my educa-

tion,” Gonzalez said. “I was able to form 

my own opinions on issues I realized are 

important for me: women’s rights.” 
I

n the final presidential debate on 

Thursday Oct. 22, Joe Biden said, 

“character is on the ballot.” The 

president’s character has the ability to ei-

ther encourage or hinder hate. 

Ginns was cautiously optimistic when 

explaining that if Biden is to win the elec-

tion, saying “things won’t be fixed with 

a snap of the fingers.” However, Ginns 

noted that we, as a country, will be on the 
trajectory to fixing things. 

Like Ginns, I am well aware that this 

election is not going to automatically fix 

the many injustices in our society, the 

economy or the fact that we are in the 

midst of a pandemic. Nor do I expect it to. 

However, this election is a testament for 

what the future holds. This election is not 

a matter of being a Democrat or Republi-

can — it is not a partisan issue. It is a hu-

man rights issue. 

It is difficult for me to prioritize one 

issue in this election because there is so 

much at stake, and there is a connected-

ness amongst every issue. There is an 

intersection between the economy and 

racial justice; there is an intersection be-

tween climate change and the economy. 

It is not merely a coincidence that when 

the economy shut down because of CO-

VID-19, we began to see clearer skies and 

higher air quality. It is not merely a co-

incidence that low-wage workers and 

single parent households, many of whom 

need unemployment insurance (because 

they lost their work due to COVID), can-

not get it. It is not merely a coincidence 

that COVID-19 hits low-income, minority 

communities the hardest. All of these is-

sues will not magically be remedied with 

a favorable election outcome. What this 

election will do is ensure they are seen as 

issues and treated like issues that must be 

addressed and resolved. 

It is undeniable that this is a symbolic 

election. There is much more on the bal-

lot than just a candidate, just as there is 

much more power behind simply shad-

ing in the name of a candidate. Our vote 

is a form of speech. It allows us to express 

what we condemn and what we condone. 
As John Lewis, former civil rights leader 

and former U.S. Representative compel-

lingly said at the prescient commence-

ment speech he gave in 2016, “The vote 

is precious. It is almost sacred. It’s the 

most powerful non-violent tool we have 

in a democratic society and we’ve got to 

use it.”

What are you voting for?


statement

The long, stressful 
wait for Nov. 3

I 

can’t stop listening to the news. I can’t stop reading 

the news. I can’t stop thinking about the news. Elec-

tion Day is Nov. 3, and consuming any type of media 

about the dreaded date sends me spiraling into cycles of fear 

and doubt.

Though the news causes me anxiety, I feel a responsibility 

to keep myself informed about the happenings of the world 

around us. However, with each headline I am reminded about 

how little control I have over the fate of this election. I can’t 

change the fact that neither of the people running for presi-

dent would be my first choice. Nor can I change the fact that I 

live in a country with a two-party system. I can’t eradicate the 

Electoral College. I can’t stop Donald Trump from refusing to 

denounce white supremacy. The list of things that are out of 

my control goes on and on and on. 

Not feeling in control of the world around me isn’t some-

thing I want to get used to because, to a certain extent, we 

all 
have 
plenty of control in how we 

w a n t 
to shape the world. We can 

shape our world through 

actions as small as how 

we interact with our 

neighbors, peers and 

friends, through what 

we choose to post on 

Instagram and how we 

work at the ground level 

to rebuild our own communities. Yet, when it comes to the 

election season, I feel like all I can control is who and what I 

vote for, as well as convincing others to vote and talking to the 

Republicans in my life about why they should vote blue. 

Though I don’t consider myself a Democrat, I have voted 

for the Democratic Party in every election that I am eligible. 

Many of my leftist ideals are not encapsulated in the policies 

of the Democratic Party — I am in favor of the common own-

ership of the means of production as well as a direct democ-

racy. However, voting Democrat in this election will bring the 

administration closer to my viewpoints rather than voting for 

a third-party candidate or for the Republican Party. 

I have noticed that I have been feeling more anxiety re-

garding this election than ever before. Perhaps it’s because I 

am more knowledgeable about politics at the age of 21 than 

when I was 17, or maybe it’s because this is the first presiden-

tial election I am old enough to vote in. It might also be that 

this year feels entirely different than years past. In my senior 

year of high school, I could have never predicted that my last 

year of college would be spent social distancing because of a 

pandemic. 

In the days leading up to the first presidential debate ear-

lier this month, I stayed up late at night playing out all the pos-

sible worst-case scenarios in my head. I bit my nails to a nub 

waiting in line to vote early at the city clerk’s satellite office at 

the University of Michigan Museum of Art. Like many voters 

this year, I opted to vote early to avoid exposure to COVID-19 

in overpopulated Election Day lines. 

However, voting early gave me as much anx-

iety as the potential expo-

sure to COVID-19 would. 

It’s hard for me to 

trust that my vote 

will be counted when the Trump administration is actively 

engaging in voter suppression and relying on it to win the 

election. 

Since last year, I’ve developed the bad habit of twirling my 

hair into small knots whenever I’m stressed. In light of news 

such as this, I’ve cut out at least ten stands of my twisted hair. 

This habit reminds me of how I felt on the night of the elec-

tion in 2016.

I was sitting in a coffee shop with my best friend, my anxi-

ety at an all-time high, as I switched between tabs on my 

computer with college applications and the polls. When I 

saw Trump gaining more electoral votes than Hillary Clinton 

when states like Michigan were called, I expected my heart to 

sink in disappointment. Yet, I was only numb. I guess this was 

my way of coping with fear. 

Cynicism as a result of anxiety about the election can lead 

to political apathy, which has caused many eligible voters to 

opt out of voting. I too have felt and recognize the feeling of 

a lack of control that election season brings, and the cynicism 

that follows. 

The day after Trump was elected, I walked around school 

like a zombie. I listened as my fellow classmates screamed 

“Trump 2016” from the corners of the hallways of my public 

high school in Marshall, Mich. I teared up in my economics 

class only to have my teacher pull me aside and say, “It’s al-

right … he has Mike Pence as his VP. Pence is a good man.” The 

words weren’t comforting then and they still bring me feel-

ings of unsettlement now. 

I’ve dealt with generalized anxiety for most of my life. The 

battle to defeat the worrisome thoughts and troubling fears 

is a lifelong one. During election season, this battle seems all 

the more daunting, especially amid a pandemic. However, not 

voting because of my anxiety during election season is giving 

up what little control I do have as an American citizen. I wish 

I could say casting my ballot a few weeks ago eradicated my 

anxiety completely, but that is far from the case. I’m not sure I 

ever won’t feel anxious about the state of our nation. 

Our country’s politics terrified me when I was 17 and they 

terrify me even more now. Perhaps it will get better and per-

haps it won’t. I’m hoping for the former, yet I’ve grown accus-

tomed to accepting the latter.

‘We’re all just really excited to exercise our right’: Athletes registering to vote

Vote. 
A four letter word and a simple 

action, yet one with a lot of power 
behind it. 

But in America, it is an action 

that is often neglected. In 2016, only 
55.7% of eligible people turned out 
to vote, a number bested by 26 other 
developed democratic countries. It 
wasn’t just the 2016 election though 
— voter turnout for Americans has 
been around 50-60% for the last 
few presidential elections and much 
less for the off-year congressional 
midterms. 

This year, there seems to be a 

change of tides as a dangerous virus 
spreads effortlessly, an uprising 
against racial injustice and political 
tensions continue to divide the 
country. 

“A lot of people right now feel 

helpless because there are a lot of 
bad things in the news,” Michigan 
volleyball 
sophomore 
middle 

blocker Jess Robinson said. “Life 
is pretty insane right now, but one 
thing we can change in this world 
is our government — the people 
representing us — and the way to do 
that is voting.”

This 
renewed 
energy 
to 

participate in the oldest institution 
of 
political 
participation 
has 

become an exciting opportunity 
to Robinson and her teammates. 
As of this week, the entire team 
— barring international players — 
have registered and plan to vote in 
the November election. 

“When we found out it was 100%, 

we were just so happy. We were so 

proud,” Robinson said. “The people 
who weren’t registered to vote were 
freshmen. We helped them through 
it. That was sort of a fun thing to do 
with them on getting their absentee 
ballots mailed to their new homes 
in Ann Arbor. So that was a big 
milestone for them and it was a big 
victory for the team.”

Robinson is one of several 

Michigan student-athletes leading 
initiatives to help register the rest 
of their teammates. Defensive 

linemen Kwity Paye and Carlo 
Kemp helped register the football 
team by organizing tables where 
players could sign up after practice. 
Men’s basketball senior forward 
Isaiah Livers helped get the rest 
of the men’s basketball team 
registered. 

“We just wanted to do our part,” 

Paye told The Daily last month. 
“Make sure that we’re voting. Just 
because the stuff that’s going on 
right now, it’s just ridiculous.”

These 
valiant 
mobilization 

efforts made by these student-
athletes reflect a larger movement 
boiling beneath the surface — one 
among the youth. 

“We’re the people who are going 

to inherit this world,” Robinson 
said, “so we should make it the best 
one we can, because right now it’s 
not looking too good. We’re the ones 
who have to stay (here) the longest, 
so I think that young people should 
try and get into (everything).” 

With volleyball unlikely being 

played in the fall, voter registration 
has become a team-building activity 
for the Wolverines. Robinson and 
her teammates were excited to 
register and get involved. They even 
treated it as a way to help integrate 
the freshmen into the team. 

“We only get this chance once 

every four years,” Robinson said. 
“This is my first time voting 
because I just turned 18 in the last 
year, so it was a pretty big deal for 

me and is for a lot of people on this 
team. We’re all just really excited 
to exercise our right because we 
just feel like a lot of things have to 
change and this is the best way to 
do it.”

As the election date looms, 

people everywhere are joining 
mobilization efforts and getting 
themselves prepared to vote. On 
Michigan’s campus, athletes’ voices 
ring loudly. They recognize the 
special attention their platform 
brings them, and they’re making 
the most of this responsibility. 

“We get out to thousands of 

more people than what a normal 
student would,” women’s basketball 
sophomore forward Naz Hillmon 
told The Daily at a student-athlete 
led protest in August. “I really 
think that we are taking advantage 
of our platform, just trying to get 
information out there and just 
trying to put our thoughts out 
there. … Just trying to put out 
positive information and correct 
information.”

Robinson 
and 
the 
other 

many 
student-athletes 
want 

their initiative to be seen to help 
motivate others. They understand 
the power and influence their 
actions and voice can have. For 
voting, they are excited to reveal 
their accomplishment and hope it 
inspires others to do the same.

“(Voting is) just really important 

to everyone,” Robinson said. “No 
matter what your opinion (is), it’s 
that your opinion is being heard and 
that you (are) at least registered, 
voting, … casting your ballot and 
... being a part of the democratic 
(process).” 

O

n March 13, 2020, 
three plain-clothed 
Louisville 
Metro 

Police Department 

Officers — Jonathan Mattingly, 
Brett 
Hankison 
and 
Myles 

Cosgrove — forced entry into the 
apartment 
of 
Breonna 

Taylor, 
a 

26 
year-

old 
Black 

woman, 
executing 
a 
search 

warrant. 
The officers 
shot 
their 

firearms 
32 

times 
with 

six of them 
killing Taylor.

Taylor’s murder reached the 

mainstage of the public eye when 
protests erupted after the horrific 
death of George Floyd. She became 
a rallying cry for the suffering of 
the Black community, specifically 
Black women, in protests against 
generational systemic oppression. 

Around the country, the sports 

community has become a leader 
in the fight against racial injustice 
to an extent it never has before. 
When the NBA travelled down to 
their Disney World bubble in early 
July, many players diverted their 
press conferences and used their 
platform to discuss these issues, 
echoing 
names 
like 
Breonna 

Taylor. So too did WNBA players 
at their bubble in Bradenton, Fla., 
some 120 miles away.

In 
Ann 
Arbor, 
several 

University of Michigan athletes 
have used their own platform 
to speak up. In August, football 
senior defensive back Hunter 
Reynolds 
joined 
forces 
with 

Eastern 
Michigan 
linebacker 

Tariq Speights to organize a Black 
Lives Matter rally with hundreds 
of attendees.

“Well I think we’re in a unique 

position where we have a lot of 
people looking at us for what we 
do for athletics and what not,” 
Audrey LeClair, a sophomore 
on 
the 
softball 
team 
who 

participated in the protest, said. 
“And we represent this school 
and therefore we have a platform 

that we can use and it’s really 
important. And just it’s important 
to use it because we have a certain 
voice that a lot of regular students 
don’t have. … As you saw, we’re all 
more than an athlete.” 

The same chants passionately 

screamed 
at 
many 
protests 

against social injustice could be 
heard at this one — one of them 
calling for the memory of Taylor:

“Say her name!”
“Breonna Taylor!
As more time passed, many 

continued to place pressure on 
Kentucky 
Attorney 
General 

Daniel Cameron to arrest the 
officers who killed Taylor. 

On Sept. 23, a grand jury 

indicted Hankinson on wanton 
endangerment charges for the 
10 shots fired inside Taylor’s 
residence. 
Cosgrove 
and 

Mattingly were not criminally 
charged and the death of Taylor 
was not placed on any of the 

officers. 

Another uproar of emotion 

flooded the streets in Louisville, 
Chicago, New York City, Los 
Angeles, Washington, D.C. and 
hundreds of other cities. The 
same chants and signs proclaimed 
anger toward the failure of the 
justice system. 

And, once again, athletes were 

at the center of the movement.

Former Fab Five star Jalen 

Rose used his position as a 
commentator on ESPN’s NBA 
Finals broadcast to display his 
frustration with the decision 
made.

“When Kyle Rittenhouse, in 

Milwaukee as a 17-year-old, kills 
two people, yet three cops aren’t 
directly charged with killing 
Breonna Taylor ... it shows you 
how they feel about Black lives in 
America,” Rose later said. 

It became too overwhelming 

for him to solely focus on 

basketball 
during 
such 
a 

momentous and emotional time 
in the United States. Other NBA 
players shared in that struggle, as 
the league stopped play for two 
days as a result of the Milwaukee 
Bucks boycott, later joined by all 
the other playoff teams. 

“So, we are starting a game 

... It’s 400 years of slavery to 0,” 
Rose said during the pregame 
show. “We know we’re not 
(going to) win, but you still gotta 
continue to move the ball forward 
and put people behind you in a 
position to be successful, and 
that’s what we’re here to do today. 
… That’s what the NBA players 
are doing today, and that’s why 
I applaud them because while 
they’re out, they’re performing 
with heavy hearts trying to win a 
championship. I understand that 
this is really painful, to show up 
to work and still try to entertain.”

Michigan defensive graduate 

assistant and and former player 
Mike McCray also displayed 
his 
outrage 
by 
tweeting 

his 
displeasure, 
as 
well 
as 

consistently sharing information 
about Taylor’s murder.

Ambry Thomas, another former 

Michigan player, also joined the 
flurry of furious athletes. 

To honor Taylor’s memory, we 

must listen to Thomas, McCray, 
Rose and so many more: The lack 
of justice in the case of Breonna 
Taylor once again proves the 
troubling reality of the presence 
of racism in America. There are 
so many names — whether they 
are publicly known or not — that 
exemplify the horrors of police 
brutality against Black people. 
Wickedly, many of them result in 
the same unfulfillment as Taylor. 

It is important to remember 

these people so that they are never 
forgotten. The deaths of Breonna 
Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George 

Floyd and Jacob Blake must spark 
change, as their examples have 
provided an awakening for many 
Americans. 

Athletes 
have 
played 
an 

integral role in the awareness of 
these victims, as they have that 
ability to reach a large portion of 
people. Their voice carries weight 
and will continue, especially as a 
momentous and critical election 
nears. Whether their viewpoints 
and opinions are in agreement 
with the people listening, the 
subject matter is non-negotiable. 
The case of Breonna Taylor 
demonstrates that racism is real — 
and it is not a political topic that 
can be argued over. 

As Rose said, the game is “400 

years of slavery to 0” and there is 
a lot more work to do to achieve 
true equality.

Athletes from Michigan and Eastern Michgian organized a Black Lives Matter protest in Ann Arbor this August to remember victims of police brutality, such as Breonna Taylor, and advocate for reform.

MINNEAPOLIS — There were 

10 months of alternating hope and 
despair, and at the end of it, there 
was a swarm of white jerseys in a 
barren stadium in Minneapolis, 
congregating on the 20-yard line to 
celebrate a season-opening victory.

That was the scene Saturday 

night at TCF Bank Stadium, closed 
to all but 589 family and friends due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic that 
delayed the start of Big Ten play by 
eight weeks, after No. 18 Michigan 
beat No. 21 Minnesota, 49-24.

It was a moment cemented 

by 58 minutes of the Wolverines 
answering every question they’ve 
faced for the past eight months.

“I’m really, just really proud of 

our team,” Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh said. “I believe in them 
and I respect them and I trust 
them. And I just wanted to go out 
there tonight and just let it rip and 
they did that.”

In 
the 
opening 
moments, 

though, Michigan didn’t have it so 
easy.

A promising opening drive was 

derailed by a pair of negative plays 
before a blocked punt set up an 
easy Gophers’ touchdown. As the 
Wolverines trotted off the field 
down 7-0, it was easy wonder if 
they were mired in the same place 
they were 297 days ago, when they 
rang in the new year with a Citrus 
Bowl loss that made you wonder 
how anything would ever change.

The 10 months since have 

only added to that frustration. 
Michigan had to replace its two-
year starting quarterback, Shea 
Patterson, and 12 other starters, all 
while navigating a pandemic that 
temporarily canceled the season 
back in August.

And then suddenly, over the 

course of a few first-quarter 
minutes 
Saturday 
night, 

everything changed. At the center 
of it all stood junior quarterback 
Joe Milton, guiding Michigan 
through one last hurdle.

“Joe, he’s always cool and 

collected,” junior running back 
Hassan Haskins said. “He don’t 
get worried like that. You know 
he’s gonna do his thing. So that’s 
why we got all our trust in him. We 
know he’s gonna do his job.”

Beleaguered 
for 
his 
lack 

of experience, Milton was a 
commanding presence all night, 
finishing with 277 total yards and 
no turnovers in his first career 
start. Famed for his arm strength, 
he helped Michigan pull away 
in the first quarter with a third-
down touch pass into the heart 
of Minnesota’s defense followed 
by a smart, simple toss to senior 
fullback Ben Mason for an eight-
yard touchdown.

“(Milton) handled everything 

with aplomb,” Harbaugh said. “His 
accuracy in the passing game, real 
command of the offense.”

But on a day that was regarded 

as Milton’s reckoning, he often 
took a backseat to the Wolverines’ 
run game, spearheaded by an 
offensive line featuring four new 
starters. It’s a unit that’s faced an 
offseason of constant skepticism, 
but throughout it all, Michigan 
remained confident.

Ten plays into the game, 

skepticism evaporated in the form 
of a perfectly executed power run 
that sophomore running back 
Zach Charbonnet took 70 yards 
untouched into the end zone, tying 
the score at seven.

Three drives later, the defense 

got on the board. Junior VIPER 
Michael Barrett came off the 
edge to fold Gophers’ quarterback 
Tanner Morgan in half on the 
precipice of his own goal line, 
leaving the ball spilling away from 
his splayed body into defensive 
tackle Donovan Jeter’s open arms 
for a Michigan lead.

“(Defensive coordinator Don 

Brown) put a gameplan to give 
some looks that we haven’t gave 
before,” Barrett said. “It definitely 
made an impact on them. You can 
tell that they started checking, 
being extra cautious. So yeah, it 

definitely had an impact on the 
game.”

The Wolverines never looked 

back, scoring five touchdowns in 
their next six drives, four of them 
on the ground.

But with the sense of occasion 

marred by an eerie silence that 
could only meet game-changing 
plays with a murmer, Michigan’s 
jubilation never fully boiled over. 
There were high fives and hugs, 
but never scrums spilling onto the 
field in celebration of Harbaugh’s 
most decisive away win over a 
ranked opponent.

And at the end of it, the only 

sign of a dejected home crowd 
was Minnesota’s parents turning 
toward the exits en masse, a 
small trickle where a river would 
normally flow. On the other side 
of the stadium, Michigan’s parents 
gravitated down towards their 
sons, who headed into the locker 
room.

There, the Little Brown Jug 

awaited, providing confirmation 
that their first game in 297 days 
had finished with their first win 
in 336.

Twenty 
minutes 
after 

Michigan 
wrapped 
up 
a 

blowout win over Minnesota — 
on the road, against a ranked 
team, no less — Josh Gattis left 
a short message on Twitter.

“1-0,” he wrote. “We will 

clean it up and keep working!”

Last year when Gattis made 

similar remarks, they sounded 
like excuses for an offense that 
was inconsistent and made too 
many mistakes. This time, they 
felt like a nitpick.

Sure, there are always things 

for an offense to clean up, but 
the offense that showed up in 
Minneapolis Saturday felt far 
removed from that of Gattis’ 
first year.

The Wolverines put up 49 

points, more than they did 
against any team last year 
except Rutgers. They didn’t 
have a single turnover. Ten 
different players had a run or 
pass play of at least 10 yards. 
Four of seven third downs were 

converted.

A year after Gattis came to 

Michigan 
preaching 
“speed 

in space,” here it finally was 
in all its glory. Finally, the 
Wolverines seemed to have a 
cohesive gameplan designed to 
fit its offense — and executed it.

“It 
feels 
great 
for 
me 

because I don’t have to do too 
much,” junior quarterback Joe 
Milton said. “I’ve got a lot of 
playmakers. Give those guys 
the ball because that’s what 
they’re here for, they’re gonna 
make a play.”

Indeed, Milton wasn’t asked 

to do a lot. Despite Milton’s 
well-known arm strength, he 
attempted few deep bombs 
Saturday. Instead, he tossed 
screen passes and end-arounds 
and ran the ball himself. But 
the reason Milton didn’t need 
to get too fancy was because 
the plan worked. He finished 
15-of-22 for 225 yards on the 
night.

Whether it was junior wide 

receiver Ronnie Bell breaking 
tackles en route to a 30-yard run 

in, senior fullback Ben Mason 
cartwheeling the ball into the 
end zone, junior running back 
Hassan 
Haskins 
barreling 

through defenders or Milton 
keeping the ball himself, each 
play seemed like it was catered 
to the person making it.

“Our gameplan going in was 

just, make big plays, you hear 
me?” Haskins said. “We’ve got 
playmakers, we’ve just gotta 
make big plays. We’ve got all 
the tools. … Everyone gonna 
touch the field, when you’ve 
got so many you can just go to 
whoever you want. Everybody 
get their shine on, everybody 
do their thing and just go like 
that.”

Last year, Michigan largely 

lacked an offensive identity. 
Against teams like Penn State, 
Wisconsin and Ohio State, it 
played too sloppy and turned 
the ball over too many times. 
Meanwhile, 
it 
consistently 

came up short in big moments.

Saturday was, of course, one 

game. The next step for the 
Wolverines is doing it again 
and again. But the win over the 
Golden Gophers showed what 
Michigan’s offense can be — one 
full of playmakers and capable 
of getting those playmakers the 
ball consistently.

“I just trust them and I 

just wanted them to do that 
because they’re talented guys,” 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said. “Just put talented guys out 
there … and see what happens 
and let everybody be surprised 
at how good he does. That’s 
what I envisioned, that’s how I 
visualized this game.”

Just put talented guys out 

there and see what happens. 
If the Wolverines can do that 
every Saturday, they could 
have an offense capable of 
making noise against good 
teams. That’s credit to Gattis 
and his offensive philosophy 
that seems to finally be coming 
to fruition.

In an impressive first start, Joe Milton vindicates Michigan’s process

MINNEAPOLIS — Joe Milton 

didn’t think he’d be emotional.

He had prepared for this 

moment for the better part of 
three years or, in some senses, 
a lifetime. He thought that 
meant he would be stoic on 
Saturday, when he was set to 
suit up as Michigan’s starting 
quarterback for the first time.

So 
Milton 
embarked 
on 

the same routine he’s carried 
out as the Wolverines’ third 
stringer for the past two years. 
He walked into the locker 
room, dressed head to toe 
in blue Michigan warmups, 
save for a pair of all-black 
Nike Air Force 1s and a white 
beanie emblazoned with the 
logo of The Uniform Funding 
Foundation. Over the beanie, he 
played music through a pair of 
black headphones.

When he got into the locker 

room, Milton sat down and 
removed 
his 
headphones, 

immersing 
himself 
in 
the 

surroundings 
of 
TCF 
Bank 

Stadium’s away locker room.

That’s when it hit him.
“I started tearing up,” Milton 

said, “because it’s real.”

Four hours later, he had 

commanded 
a 
convincing, 

49-24, 
win 
over 
No. 
21 

Minnesota, the biggest road 
win over a ranked team in the 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
era. 
Milton 

completed 15 of 22 passes for 
225 yards and a touchdown, 
adding 52 yards and a score on 
the ground.

For Milton, it was a dream 

debut. For Michigan, it was 
the 
vindicating 
culmination 

of four years of scouting and 
development.

The Wolverines first heard 

about 
Milton 
in 
part 
due 

to his high school coach’s 
connections on the Michigan 
staff. Immediately, Milton, a 
converted wide receiver, caught 
the eye of Harbaugh and then-
offensive 
coordinator 
Tim 

Drevno.

“His arm strength was huge 

coming out of high school,” 

Drevno told The Daily this 
week. “He was a guy who could 
make a play where there was no 
play to be made.”

That much is lore by now — 

the 80-yard throws in practice, 
the 
passes 
delivered 
with 

such force that they mangle 
receivers’ hands.

But shrouding the talent was 

a unique lack of production. 
While 
most 
four-star 
high 

school 
quarterbacks 
are 

leading their teams to state 
titles, Milton never eclipsed a 
50% completion percentage at 
Olympia High School.

His weaknesses, according to 

Drevno, ranged from dropback 
technique to going through his 
reads. And yet, excitement in 
their new recruit bubbled at 
Schembechler Hall.

“You don’t want to get the 

guy that’s already polished,” 
Drevno said. “You wanna know 
a guy, what’s his ceiling? How 
much better is he gonna get?”

In Milton, Michigan had that 

to the extreme. So from the 
moment he arrived on campus 

in the winter of 2018, the 
Wolverines had a development 
plan.

Initially fourth on the depth 

chart behind Shea Patterson, 
Dylan McCaffrey and Brandon 
Peters, Milton still saw an 
outsized share of the workload 
in practices to acclimate him to 
the speed of college football.

“They knew what he was 

capable of,” Kyle Grady, a walk 
on quarterback who was with 
the team during the 2018-19 
school year, told The Daily. 
“And they did a good job of 
getting him in there, getting 
him physical reps.”

But more important at first 

was his work in the film room.

Over the course of his first 

year 
at 
Michigan, 
Milton 

worked with Pep Hamilton, 
the Wolverines’ passing game 
coordinator at the time, to 
improve his understanding of 
defenses. 
That 
development 

course 
accelerated 
in 
Jan. 

2019, when Michigan replaced 
Hamilton 
with 
offensive 

coordinator Josh Gattis and 

promoted 
offensive 
analyst 

Ben McDaniels to quarterbacks 
coach.

According 
to 
Grady, 

McDaniels 
had 
a 
different 

approach 
to 
Milton’s 

development. 
McDaniels 

started 
from 
square 
one, 

making Milton re-learn the 
most basic defensive schemes 
— Cover 0 and Cover 1 — and 
building up to obscure and 
disguised variances of more 
flexible schemes like Cover 2 
and Cover 6.

“That was huge for all the 

quarterbacks’ 
development, 

but Joe specifically to go from 
square 
one, 
ask 
questions 

he needs to ask and really 
thoroughly understand what 
the defense is trying to do to 
you,” Grady said.

By last fall, when McCaffrey 

suffered 
a 
concussion 
that 

forced Milton into backup duty, 
his progress was tangible. He 
showed the touch that Harbaugh 
has repeatedly emphasized on 
multiple occasions, including on 
his first career touchdown pass 
against Rutgers.

“There’s 
different 
ball 

flights, different appropriate 
throws,” Harbaugh said then. 
“Not everything is a line drive 
fastball.”

Early in the first quarter 

on 
Saturday, 
it 
was 
that 

development that crystalized 
itself on the most important 
play of Milton’s young career. 
Tied at seven on the edge of 
field goal range, Michigan faced 
a key early third-and-5.

Freshman receiver Roman 

Wilson lined up in the slot 
to the left, running a post 
route over the middle, where 
Milton delivered a perfectly 
placed touch pass in between 
the dropping linebackers and 
converging safeties.

A drive later, it was Milton’s 

decision making on display. 
Rolling out to his left from the 
eight-yard line, Milton had 
Wilson and sophomore tight 
end Erick All running routes in 
the end zone. When both players 
were covered, he sold a fake to 
All and found senior fullback 
Ben Mason in the flat, allowing 
Mason to make an acrobatic 

play for the touchdown.

“He was on target all night 

and played with the poise of a 
savvy veteran,” Harbaugh said 
after the game. “Had a great 
command of the offense.”

There were times, too, when 

Milton’s innate duality shone 
through.

With 22 seconds left in 

the first half, he misread the 
defense, throwing to All in 
double coverage on a four 
verticals concept and narrowly 
avoiding an interception. After 
the 
game, 
Harbaugh 
said, 

“He went through his reads 
extremely 
well. 
Maybe 
he 

missed one that I can think of,” 
likely in reference to the play.

Milton, though, regrouped 

and made the type of throw that 
had the Wolverines salivating 
over him as a high school 
prospect. Rolling to his left 
away from pressure, Milton 
flicked his wrist and delivered 
a 45-yard pass across his body, 
inches away from sophomore 
receiver 
Giles 
Jackson’s 

outstretched arms, only foiled 
by Jackson’s indirect route to 
the ball.

A quarter later, Milton made 

a similar play, only more within 
the realm of human possibility. 
Stepping up to his left again, he 
found All in the flat. Harbaugh 
later called it a “perfect” throw, 
on a play that he said Milton 
wouldn’t have been able to make 
a year or two ago.

It came a play after Milton 

jumped sideways down the 
Michigan sideline, with his 
left arm on his hip and right 
arm pointed toward All in 
celebration 
of 
a 
surefire 

touchdown only to see his pass 
drop through All’s hands. When 
it fell, Milton briefly dropped 
his head in dejection, before 
jogging back to the huddle and 
trying again.

Two 
plays 
later, 
the 

Wolverines were in the end 
zone anyway, thanks to their 
new quarterback, and the three 
years that turned his promise 
into reality.

“I was pretty impressed with 

myself,” Milton said through a 
thin smile. “I’ve been working 
on that a long time.”

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

M

INNEAPOLIS 
— There was a 
notion coming 
into 
Saturday 

that this season was supposed 
to serve as an 
in-between 
period 
of 

sorts for the 
Michigan 
football team.

The 
past 

two 
years 

have 
been 

defined 
by 
Shea 

Patterson’s 
presence, even as he devolved 
into a divisive figure. Next year, 
there’s 
the 
much-anticipated 

arrival of five-star quarterback 
J.J. McCarthy, along with the 
maturation of star-studded 2019 
and 2020 recruiting classes.

Both eras carried boundless 

hope and optimism. This year 
was supposed to have neither.

And then, on Saturday night, 

Michigan found its identity.

“I just wanted to go out 

there tonight and just let it rip 
and they did that,” Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh said after 
the Wolverines dispatched an 
overmatched Minnesota, 49-24.

What exactly does letting it rip 

entail? Not what you might think.

If you’re conjuring up images 

of 
junior 
quarterback 
Joe 

Milton chucking the football 
70 yards downfield, you won’t 
get what you’re looking for in 
Saturday’s tape. What you will 
get is a masterclass in offensive 
efficiency, thanks to the game 
plan of offensive coordinator 
Josh Gattis. And in the end, you 
get 481 yards on 56 plays, good 
for an eye-popping 8.6 yards per 
play.

It started with a swing pass to 

running back Blake Corum that 
went for 24 yards through the 
heart of the Gophers’ defense.

Blake Corum? On the first 

play of the season? Isn’t he a 
freshman? Fair questions, but 
Gattis won’t have it. This is how 
he wants to operate: in a true 
meritocracy.

That became evident quickly 

with freshman wide receiver 
Roman 
Wilson 
and 
scantly-

used senior fullback Ben Mason 
getting key first-quarter targets. 
For all the murmurs about who 
would start at running back, five 
players saw at least four carries 
and none saw more than eight. 
The situation was similar in the 
passing game, where nine players 
caught a pass with none securing 
more than four.

“I’ve got a lot of playmakers 

and get those guys the ball, 
because that’s what they’re here 
for,” Milton said. “They’re going 
to make a play.”

The reason they’re able to 

make a play lies in the expertise 
of their offensive coordinator. 
He consistently maximized his 
weapons’ skill sets, designing 
bubble screens for Bell, slants 
for Wilson and end-arounds for 
speedy sophomore wide receiver 
Giles Jackson.

It was the type of offensive 

performance 
Michigan 
has 

spent 
the 
past 
half-decade 

watching from afar or, more 
problematically, 
from 
the 

opposing sideline. It was also the 
type of performance that was 
promised when Harbaugh hired 
Gattis in Jan. 2019.

In 
Gattis’ 
first 
season, 

though, the Wolverines’ identity 
remained 
the 
same. 
There 

were hints of his intentions 
here and there, in the form of 
a new read-based offense, but 

Gattis was often handicapped 
by his personnel. Even at his 
best, Patterson was a remnant 
of a previous regime and often 
struggled to make the reads 
Gattis asked of him.

His offense, therefore, was 

often uncreative, and Michigan’s 
identity remained its increasingly 
erratic defense.

This year, Gattis has his guys 

— or at least those like Milton, 
whom his staff has molded for 
the better part of two years.

“We’re gonna run our offense 

and build it around who we 

have at the quarterback position 
as well as who we have at skill 
positions,” Gattis said on Sept. 23. 
“We’ve got a number of different 
skill players that are going to be 
exciting with the ball in hand. 
We’re gonna be well-rounded.”

And as a result, Michigan is 

finally a realization of Gattis’ 
vision. For the first time in the 
Harbaugh era, its identity lies in 
an explosive offense.

That was the promise back in 

Jan. 2019, in the wake of back-
to-back games in which the 
Wolverines allowed a combined 

103 points despite boasting the 
second-best total defense in the 
country. Those games were a 
wake-up call for Harbaugh, a 
sign that defense alone can’t be 
an elite program’s identity in the 
era of spread offenses.

On Saturday, that identity 

revolution was finally complete. 
At least, it looked like it for the 
first time.

It’s a transition that’s enabled 

games like Saturday’s, when the 
Wolverines can dominate despite 
defensive inconsistency.

Bigger tests, of course, lie 

ahead. 
Wisconsin 
and 
Penn 

State are on deck in the next 
month. Neither will see a pro-
spread offense and roll over, 
like Minnesota did. I won’t even 
mention the opponent on Dec. 12, 
because why be a killjoy?

But regardless of what comes 

next, Michigan will be better 
prepared than ever to adjust 
when things go south. And for 
that, it has Gattis and its new 
identity to thank.

Barrett shows he can 
change games at VIPER

During 
Michael 
Barrett’s 

freshman year in 2018, Michigan 
defensive 
coordinator 
Don 

Brown decided to think outside 
the box.

At the time, Barrett was 

still bouncing around between 
different 
positions. 
He 
was 

recruited as a general athlete 
following a stellar high school 
career as a quarterback in 
Georgia. When he signed with 
the Wolverines, Jim Harbaugh 
compared Barrett to former 
All-Pro wide receiver Anquan 
Boldin, while others expected 
him to settle in as a running 
back.

For a while, nobody knew for 

sure where Barrett would fit in. 
So when Brown asked Barrett to 
go through a series of defensive 
drills, it didn’t seem like a big 
deal.

But when Brown watched 

Barrett ace coverage workouts, 
it forever changed Barrett’s 
trajectory. 
From 
that 
point 

forward, he was a VIPER in 
traiwning, waiting in the wings 
as Khaleke Hudson blossomed 
into a star. Before Hudson, 
Heisman finalist Jabrill Peppers 
dominated the position.

On Saturday night, it was 

Barrett’s turn to step into the 
role that has defined Michigan’s 
defense since Brown arrived 
five years ago. Now a redshirt 
sophomore, Barrett seized the 
moment, assembling a highlight 
tape of game-changing plays 
in the 18th-ranked Wolverines’ 
49-24 win over No. 21 Minnesota.

It didn’t take long for Barrett 

to make his presence known. 
Less than eight minutes into 
the game, he rocked Gophers’ 
quarterback Tanner Morgan on 
a blindside blitz. The jarring hit 
popped the ball out of Morgan’s 
possession and into the hands 
of senior defensive lineman 
Donovan Jeter, who returned 
it 15 yards for a go-ahead 
touchdown.

The Wolverines never trailed 

again from that point on, thanks 
in large part to Barrett’s steady 
production at the heart of the 
defense.

“Where 
I’ve 
seen 
Mike 

Barrett improve most is just 

consistency,” senior linebacker 
Josh Ross said. “He’s always had 
the athleticism, he just made 
small mistakes all the time. 
Now, he’s consistent, he does 
everything right and he takes 
advantage of his opportunities. 
He’s going to have a really big 
year. … For me, it’s just the 
consistency in doing everything 
the right way in practice and 
displaying it in the game.”

After 
a 
Minnesota 
field 

goal 
trimmed 
Michigan’s 

lead to 14-10, it was Barrett 
spearheading the Wolverines’ 
response. The Gophers’ ensuing 
kickoff landed in front of Barrett 
in no man’s land, but he scooped 
it up, powered through the teeth 
of Minnesota’s special teams unit 
and picked up a sideline block 
on his way to a 66-yard return. 
By the time he was pushed out, 
he’d set Michigan’s offense up 
with a first-and-goal. Between 
the strip-sack of Morgan and 
explosive kickoff return, Barrett 
keyed two of the Wolverines’ 
three first-quarter touchdowns.

A year after turning heads 

with fourth-down trick play 
conversions against Army and 
Maryland, Barrett continued 
to produce on special teams. In 
addition to his 66-yard return, 
he recovered a crucial kickoff 
fumble to keep Minnesota at 
bay. With Michigan leading 
35-24 at the time, his heads-up 
play helped avoid a costly error 
that would’ve given the Gophers 
a chance to make it a one-
possession game.

Barrett’s 
special 
teams 

prowess isn’t new. On Saturday 
night, it was his production as 
the starting VIPER that raised 
eyebrows. He forced a crucial 
turnover and finished with 
seven tackles — 1.5 of which 
came in the Gophers’ backfield.

“I felt great,” Barrett said. 

“It felt good to finally go out 
there with the guys I’ve been 
working with, (linebackers) Cam 
(McGrone) and Josh and go out 
there and let it loose. It felt great. 
I felt like a new man.”

With Hudson and Peppers 

now in the NFL, Barrett entered 
this fall hoping to continue 
a 
strong 
lineage. 
Following 

Saturday night, it looks like the 
Brown may have found his next 
star VIPER pupil.

Gattis’ offense is now Michigan’s identity.

Enjoy.

Erick All shows promise at tight end

Even on a night that saw 

a 
surefire 
touchdown 
slip 

through 
his 
fingers, 
Erick 

All still showed promise in 
the Michigan football team’s 
season-opener.

In 
the 
13th-ranked 

Wolverines’ 49-24 win over 
Minnesota, 
the 
sophomore 

tight end finished as one of 
four Wolverines with multiple 
receptions 
— 
hauling 
in 

two catches for 33 yards as 
Michigan opened its season 
without senior tight end Nick 
Eubanks.

Beyond the box score, the 

drop sticks out like a sore 
thumb. Offensive coordinator 
Josh Gattis set him up about 
as well as he could have, using 
a 12 personnel set to dupe 
the Gophers’ defense. Junior 
quarterback Joe Milton took 
the shotgun snap, tucked the 
ball and drifted to his right. But 
instead of keeping it himself, 
Milton planted his left foot, 
reared back and threw a strike 
to All as he streaked through a 
gap between Minnesota’s two 
deepest defensive backs.

Milton’s throw hit All square 

in the hands, but he turned his 
head upfield before he could 
reel it in. In one of a couple 
blunders on an imperfect night 
for All, who also failed to bring 
in a back-shoulder throw in the 
end zone a few drives earlier, 
the ball fell to the turf.

“He had the opportunity for 

a touchdown,” Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh said Monday. 

“He’s such a good catcher, 
so natural to catch it that he 
pulled his head away as the ball 
was coming in. He just expects 
to catch everything and always 
does.”

Maybe not always. But on the 

next play, the Wolverines went 
right back to him. As Milton 
rolled left, he found All in the 
flat. He did the rest of the work, 
taking it 27 yards before going 
down at the Gophers’ four yard 
line.

“Oh, man, after that play, 

I thank God because after 
dropping that ball, I was just 
way too excited,” All said 
during a Zoom with reporters 
Monday. “I feel like the coaches 
knew that and they gave me 
the second opportunity. If it 
weren’t for that second play, I 
never would have been able to 
redeem myself and I think it 
would’ve been in my head.

“They just had the confidence 

that I don’t really drop balls. I 
don’t know. But thank God that 
the coaches believed in me and 
I was able to get out there for 
the second play and do what 
was right.”

Though All’s hiccup might 

have been a defining moment 
of the night, his performance as 
a blocker didn’t go unnoticed. 
With All’s help, Michigan’s 
offense firmly controlled the 
line of scrimmage throughout 
the game. It’s something he’s 
worked 
on 
diligently 
since 

arriving in Ann Arbor last 
year, and in the grand scheme 
of things, significantly more 
meaningful than a drop here or 
there.

For All, the most important 

development in his blocking 
came in the weight room. 
He’s gained nearly 15 pounds 
of muscle since playing last 
season at 229 pounds, which 
has allowed him to be more 
physical in the trenches.

The 
result? 
A 
better 

understanding 
of 
concepts 

taught by tight ends coach 
Sherrone 
Moore 
and 
an 

ability 
to 
implement 
them 

immediately.

“When it comes to old school 

and new school blocking, I 
really couldn’t even tell you the 
difference to be honest,” All 
said. “I just know that when 
you hit somebody hard, they 
don’t like it. … Whatever coach 
Moore teaches me, I know it’s 
right because this man is a 
genius when it comes to football 
and blocking and doing things 
the right way as a tight end.”

Added Harbaugh: “I thought 

(All) was really impressive. The 
unheralded player, probably of 
the entire offense, his blocking 
was phenomenal, in line, on the 
perimeter, just tremendous.”

On Saturday, All showed he 

belonged. He’s a player the staff 
has praised for the better part 
of the last year, and even when 
Eubanks returns, his blocking 
could be enough to carve out a 
meaningful role.

“Those first-game jitters are 

finally out of the way and we’re 
ready to roll,” All said.

If Michigan’s 49-point effort 

was merely a way of shedding 
jitters, it makes you wonder 
about its offensive ceiling — 
and All’s role within it.

Run game explosive against Gophers

Of the drums the Michigan 

football team beat publicly during 
this abbreviated fall camp, one of 
the loudest and most resounding 
was the need for more explosive 
plays in the run game.

Running 
backs 
coach 
Jay 

Harbaugh first mentioned it back 
in May. His father, Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh, and others 
have harped on the subject while 
sitting in front of their webcams 
with reporters as well. When Jay 
Harbaugh spoke to media again in 
early October, it came up again.

“We just need to take the next 

step forward in terms of creating 
explosive runs,” Jay Harbaugh 
said.

Instead of a step, consider it a 

leap.

And it took all of two drives 

before becoming evident.

Down 
a 
touchdown 
after 

allowing a disastrous punt block 
early in Saturday’s game against 
Minnesota, 
the 
Wolverines 

lined up on their second drive 
and punched open a hole for 
sophomore running back Zach 
Charbonnet. It was wide enough 
for him to run 70 yards all but 
untouched, to the house. 

That spot — down a touchdown 

after an unforced error — is one 
where Michigan has come undone 
in the past. On Saturday, it was long 
forgotten by the time the clock hit 
zeroes and the Wolverines left 
TCF Bank Stadium with a 49-24 
win.

“Their defense was misaligned 

and we were able to get (senior 
guard) Chuck Filiaga, I think 

he blocked the backside safety 
from what I was looking at,” Jim 
Harbaugh said of Charbonnet’s 
run. “You don’t expect that, but 
great job by Chuck to get up on 
the backside safety and make that 
thing go the distance.”

A defensive error, yes. One that 

Michigan would have capitalized 
on in 2019, perhaps not.

Michigan came into Saturday 

with four new starters on its 
offensive line, four running backs 
capable of getting touches and 
little time to have made it all work. 
It left having answered questions 
up front, and having proved 
that questions in the backfield 
are merely semantical. (Junior 
quarterback Joe Milton led in 
carries with eight; of the four 
running backs, it was nearly an 
even split).

The Wolverines averaged 8.3 

yards per carry and those explosive 
plays, they came when needed. 
Towards the end of the third 
quarter, junior Hassan Haskins 
broke one for 66 yards, setting up 
a Chris Evans touchdown minutes 
later that ended the competitive 
portion of the proceedings.

In 2019, the first year Josh 

Gattis held the reins as offensive 
coordinator, Michigan ran for over 
250 yards twice in 13 games. On 
Saturday, the Wolverines ran for 
256 and averaged over two yards 
more per carry than they did in 
any game in 2019.

“We got a lot of players that 

can do great things on the field,” 
Haskins said. “We got a lot of 
playmakers on the field in every 
single position group. Everybody 
can do it.”

That it came on the road, 

against a ranked opponent, albeit 
one that was missing a starting 
linebacker and had turnover at 
other positions, should not go 
unnoticed.

“Our backs, all of them played 

extremely well,” Harbaugh said. 
“I don’t know how many different 
people scored touchdowns, but it 
seemed like a lot.”

It was, to be exact, six — with 

Haskins, 
Charbonnet, 
Milton 

and fifth-year senior Chris Evans 
scoring five on the ground.

In a game anticipated to 

showcase Joe Milton’s ability 
as a passer, one of the strongest 
takeaways was ability to affect the 
run game in a way Shea Patterson 
never 
could. 
Gattis 
had 
no 

problems calling designed runs for 
his quarterback, slowly setting up 
a sure touchdown that sophomore 
tight end Erick All dropped when 
Michigan faked the same power 
run it had given Milton all night. 
(All quickly made up for his 
error with a 27-yard catch and 
run that led to a Milton rushing 
touchdown). 

Even freshman Blake Corum, 

the fourth man in most of the 
running back discussions due 
to his youth, got in on the act. 
He took an early bubble screen 
24 yards and finished with 24 
rushing yards on five carries. 

It’s one game, but that it took 

that short a time for Michigan to 
create a new expectation for the 
run game says something unto 
itself.

“Just every time our guys 

needed to step up and make a play 
and get that momentum back, they 
did tonight,” Harbaugh said. “It 
was really impressive.”

Wolverines donning 
social justice decals

On Thursday afternoon, the 

Michigan 
athletic 
department 

announced via a press release 
that all of its varsity teams will 
wear social justice decals on their 
uniforms and pregame warm-ups 
during the 2020-21 academic year.

This 
announcement 
comes 

following the success of a student-
athlete-led initiative to create two 
designs that reflect campus unity 
and diversity, one of which will be 
seen by those watching Michigan 
football take on Minnesota the 
night of Oct. 24.

The Michigan football team 

will be wearing a helmet decal 
depicting six raised fists, each of 
a different skin tone, along with 
the word “EQUALITY” beneath 
them. 

Each team will independently 

vote on whether to wear a similar 
“EQUALITY” logo to that which 
will be debuted this Saturday or a 
“BLM” logo on its uniforms. 

Additionally, Michigan student-

athletes voted to approve seven 
other slogans and themes to be 
worn on warm up apparel: “Stand 
Together,” “WAR (Wolverines 
Against Racism),” “Say Their 
Names,” “No Justice, No Peace,” 

“Justice,” “Hear Us” and “Unity.”

“The thing I love the most about 

this initiative is that they sent this 
out to everyone — not just student-
athletes of color, not only specific 
people — so that everyone was able 
to be a part of the process,” men’s 
track and field graduate student 
Roland Amarteifio said in a press 
release. “Everyone got an email 
that encouraged them to vote and 
suggest their own ideas.”

The addition of social justice 

messaging to Michigan uniforms 
comes in light of the NCAA Playing 
Rules Oversight Panel approving 
rules that allow programs to 
include patches or decals in their 
uniforms in late July.

Since then, the student-led 

initiative, which was coordinated 
by Briana Nelson, a graduate 
student on the women’s track and 
field team, has worked diligently 
to prepare designs for the fall.

“I’m excited because this is an 

opportunity for us to step outside 
of sport and advocate while also 
competing,” Nelson said in a press 
release. “It’s something that will 
draw attention during big games 
and on television. Essentially, it’s 
spreading the message, even to 
people who are just watching us 
for sport, that this is bigger than 
sports.”

In the coming week, Bengali 

Hindus around the world will 
begin Durga Puja celebrations. 
Durga Puja is an auspicious 
period where we offer our devo-
tion to Maa Durga, the Mother 
Goddess. 
Durga 
exemplifies 

strength and victory as the slay-
er of the demon Mahishasura. 
The days are filled with light 
and laughter, religious rituals 
and, of course, a million differ-
ent types of sweets and food. We 
worship our Maa Durga because 
of her strength, resilience and 
love for all of her children (the 
people of the world). In this way, 
Durga is an embodiment of the 
greater female representation: 
the supreme being we refer to 
as Devi. This year, I’m thinking 
about the way Devi exemplifies 
all of the women in my life.

When I was younger, my mom 

told me that Devi lives in every 
single woman on this earth. I 
remember feeling awestruck at 
the fact that we all carry a bit 
of magic in us. I was filled with 

wonder at the thought that all of 
the women in my life, from my 
mom to my aunts to my grand-
mothers — and even myself — are 
an embodiment of the goddess 
we collectively place our love and 
trust in. At the time, my imagi-
nation sent me to a place where 
I could see all of the women I 
knew with mini goddesses sit-
ting inside of them, ready to 
defeat evil and spread goodness 
instantly, almost like our own 
version of Tinker Bell.

Now, I’m starting to realize 

the true meaning of Devi inhab-
iting all of us. I see Devi in the 
way my mother, like the ten-
handed goddess Durga herself, 
balances her busy life of taking 
care of her family, sending us 
off to school each morning and 
even now, reminding me that she 
is just one phone call and a 30 
minute drive away if I need any-
thing. I saw Devi in her when she 
braved the fear of COVID in the 
early months of the pandemic 
so my brother and I wouldn’t be 
exposed at the store while our 
father was stuck across the bor-
der in Canada. I see Devi in her 
when she sits down to sing, her 

melodic voice floating through 
the house and finding its way 
into our hearts, giving our whole 
family the security of knowing 
that we have a mother’s love fol-
lowing us forever. Most impor-
tantly, I’ve grown up seeing 
Devi in her, in the way she has 
overcome all obstacles of immi-
grating to a new country and suc-
cessfully raising a family in this 
foreign land.

Every year, we offer endless 

prayers and resources to our 
gods and goddesses in ceremo-
nies that last the whole day; the 
entire community rejoices in 
celebrations for the entire week. 
We wait all year for Durga Puja 
to come around so we can spend 
our days eating good food and 
enjoying new clothes, but the 
older I get, the more and more 
I’m realizing that the goddess 
we worship so fervently isn’t 
just some distant mythical fig-
ure; in showing our love to Maa 
Durga, we are also promising 
our own mothers and female fig-
ures in our lives that we commit 
to loving and respecting them 
throughout the course of our 
lives.

I’ve never been a fan of 

old horror films. Though I 
can understand why people 
love movies like “Psycho” or 
“Frankenstein,” I can’t seem 
to find them satisfying or 
entertaining to watch. That 
was until I watched the 1968 
independent 
horror 
film, 

“Night of the Living Dead.”

The black and white film is 

a classic horror story. A mys-
terious zombie apocalypse 
plagues 
the 
country 
and 

strangers are forced to band 
together in order to survive 
from the man-eating crea-
tures. The film starts off with 
Barbara, played by Judith 
O’Dea, running from a herd 
of zombies after her brother 
was murdered by one of them. 
She arrives at an empty house 
in complete despair. I 
was annoyed with her 
nonsensical actions at 
this point in the film 
and felt myself getting 
bored until a new char-
acter made his entrance. 
A tall Black man named 
Ben, played by Duane 
Jones, arrives at the 
house and quickly jumps 
into action, unfazed by 
Barbara’s state of shock.

Ben quickly became 

my favorite character. 
He 
wasn’t 
overcome 

with fear at the horrors 
outside of the house. As 
more people joined the 
group, he adapted to the 
situation and became a 
natural leader. He was 
boarding up the house, 
making plans and ensur-
ing the safety of others. 
He got shit done. Until 
recent years, I hadn’t 
seen many horror films 
where the token Black 
characters 
weren’t 

playing a trope or a vil-
lain. So to have a Black lead 
as the responsible, smart, 
bad-ass leader of a group of 
white people in a movie from 
the 60s was shocking. My 
jaw dropped multiple times 
throughout the film at his 
assertiveness and bravery. 
When Ben proclaimed “I’m 
boss up here” to a hardheaded 
group of white folks, I under-
stood why so many Black 
viewers love this movie.

“Night of the Living Dead” 

holds an important space in 
Black history. Duane Jones 
was one of the first African 
Americans to have a lead role 
in a mainstream horror film. 
This is even more notable 
because there is no men-
tion of Ben’s race in the film. 
The director George Romero 
said that, though the char-
acter wasn’t written to be a 
Black man, Duane Jones had 
simply given the best audi-
tion, so they hired him. In a 
time period as tumultuous 

as the late 1960s when Black 
people 
were 
participating 

in sit-ins, planning marches 
and receiving violent push 
back from white America 
every step of the way, Ben 
was taking charge and lead-
ing a group of white people to 
safety. Duane Jones’ perfor-
mance as Ben showed audi-
ences around the country and 
the world that Black people 
could be dynamic leaders. 
We could play more than side 
characters 
or 
troublemak-

ers, and our storylines should 
hold more substance than 
just making a social commen-
tary stance.

I found myself really enjoy-

ing the movie despite my 
admitted disdain for old mov-
ies until I reached the end-
ing. As I had hoped, Ben was 
the last survivor. Through-
out the film he didn’t make 
rash decisions, he put him-
self in danger to help others 
and he tried his best to find 
a way out of the house and 
to a nearby military base for 
safety. He earned his sur-

vival. In the last few minutes 
of the film, a rescue/zombie-
killing team made its way 
toward the house. Ben crept 
upstairs from his hiding spot 
in the basement. He laid low 
in the house and waited for 
help to come his way. Instead, 
the armed mob shoots Ben in 
the head and kills him after 
mistaking him for one of the 
undead. The film ends with a 
slide show of stills as the mob 
carries Ben’s lifeless body to 
be burned with a pile of dead 
zombies.

My heart sank to my stom-

ach. I sat in front of my screen 
in disbelief as the credits 
rolled to the end. Of course, 
many good horror movies 
end in a ‘gotcha’ death of the 
protagonist but knowing that 
didn’t make me feel better. 
Ben made it all that way, and 
in the end he was still mur-
dered. Not by the undead, but 
by a gun-toting mob of white 
men. A truly horrific sight for 

Black people in rural America 
in the 1960s. His murder was 
unjustified and felt a little 
too familiar to the lynchings 
of Black folks throughout 
American history. The imag-
ery of his body being carried 
by smiling white men was 
jarring. I couldn’t help but 
make a connection to those 
old photos of lifeless Black 
men hanging from trees or 
their mangled bodies held up 
like trophies with a crowd of 
smiling white people in the 
background.

Despite how I felt about 

the ending, I wholeheartedly 
believe we need more charac-
ters like Ben in horror films. 
Horror is not a film genre 
that Black folks are usually 
given the chance to shine 
and be the hero. But nearly 
fifty years after “Night of the 
Living Dead,” Jordan Peele’s 
“Get Out” changed the nar-
rative. 

The widely successful 2017 

film tells the story of Chris, 
played by Daniel Kaluuya, 
who finally meets his white 

girlfriend’s 
parents 

on a weekend getaway 
trip only to find out 
the family has a dis-
turbing secret hiding 
in the basement. To 
me, “Get Out” is one of 
the most well-written 
and thought-out hor-
ror films of all time — 
Jordan Peele won the 
Academy 
Award 
for 

Best Original Screen-
play for his creative 
brilliance. 

While 
the 
film 

remains an exception 
and not the standard 
representation of Black 
people in horror, its 
major success shows 
white-run studios that 
there is a demand for 
movies that are actu-
ally representative of 
the people that watch 
them. And one of the 
most impactful aspects 
of the movie is the fact 
that Chris survives in 
the end! Not only does 

he avoid going to jail and 
murder, but he defeats the 
racist white family and is 
rescued by his best friend, 
another Black man. 

Peele’s 
intentional 
deci-

sions to turn the presence 
of Black horror characters 
completely around is why 
Chris’ ending feels so dif-
ferent to Ben’s. “Get Out” 
challenges the stereotypical, 
white supremacist image of 
Blackness while “Night of the 
Living Dead” purposefully 
remains colorblind. White 
people stealing the bodies of 
Black folks is not a new story 
of America but in this case 
Chris is the hero. He became 
the survivor that Ben didn’t 
have a chance to become. It’s 
a triumphant ending and I 
think it really shows how far 
Black horror has come and 
how far the Black community 
has come as well. We are the 
creators, leaders and heroes 
of our own stories.

‘I’m Boss Up Here’:
The importance of ‘Night of the 
Living Dead’ in Black horror history

BOUDHAYAN BARDHAN VIA UNSPLASH

As she braids oil and red thread 

through my hair, my grandmoth-
er tells me that her greatest fear 
is dying alone in her own home. 
Because her home had no longer 
remained a home, rather it was 
simply a place of half remem-
bered dreams and visions of a life 
once lived, of a certain sort of stale 
and heavy air that rendered the 
tea no longer sweet and the soup 
sour, lining your throat with itchy 
cotton and sticky honey so that 
screams and cries and laughter 
became muffled. It was a place of 
rusty banisters half removed from 
plaster, of too low ceilings, of water 
that took hours to heat, and her 
body half splayed and contorted in 
only the way a dead woman could 
be after she had died from a stroke 
3 days before my freshman year of 
college. 

My grandmother had prepared 

me for the expectation of her 
own death well, lodging it into 
the dough she kneaded for bread 
and the patterns and spirals of 
henna she left on the palms of my 
hands. A day I soon came to dread 
as I had learned of the inevitabil-
ity, the definiteness and the great 
equalizing power of loss over the 
years, and more so, because while 
my own grief is tightlipped and 
silent, restricted to only bathroom 
tile and the confines under my 
bed, my mother’s grief is loud, the 
kind of grief that shatters mirrors 
and fractures concrete, the kind 

of grief that covers the wedding 
china in a thin film of bitter yellow 
pulp, and peels back the corners of 
the dining room wallpaper, bloat-
ing it so that it begins to stretch and 
sag, until it comes undone from 
the wall in faded strips. Her tears 
flood the kitchen floor, lapping at 
the edges of the cabinets, surging 
into drawers so that the forks and 
knives, spoons and whisks, hole 
punched reward cards, and the 
free matchbooks from a hotel in 
Cannes begin to float. Submerg-
ing the hallowed space under the 
fridge where our left feet kick 
ice cubes, and toe crumpled cou-
pons for a diner on its third grand 
reopening, or have-you-seen-me? 
missing child notices for a girl 
from Texas, or Arkansas, as left 
feet always tend to do. Flowing 
past pink construction letters of 
unrequited love, and unvalidated 
parking passes in an angry flurry 
of bubbles and salt, and finally 
choking the radiator, trickling into 
greasy crevices and rusty corners, 
rendering it so that it can longer 
make the loud, croaking, clanging, 
guttural noises it could never cease 
to do in the hours after midnight. 

The death of a grandmother is an 

expected one. A death that doesn’t 
cause cars to swerve off roads 
and corner stores to shutter their 
doors. A death that doesn’t prompt 
morbidly excited watery phone 
calls of did-you-hear-so-and-so-
died-how-tragic. It is a death that 
is crudely thrown around, the 
grief it leaves behind so crass and 
paper thin, it functions as mostly 
an excuse out of a paper due at 

midnight. But the death of my 
own grandmother meant the final 
loss of what little connection I had 
left with the homeland. Because 
there is a special sort of finality 
that comes after a body is buried 
in the ground and I’d like to think 
that the earth would not accept my 
grandmother. That the gravedig-
gers who had 5 other bodies to bury 
before noon, heaved back and forth 
on rusty shovels, angling them this 
way and that way to no avail. That 
they clawed at the dirt with fin-
gernails and cardboard and pieces 
of glass, pouring water, showering 
it with kisses and prayers in the 
hopes that maybe the splintered 
land would fall apart. 

Now there are there are vultures 

circling my roof, their talons scrap-
ing away at tile and chipping at 
plastic siding, perched in the gut-
ters and edges of storm drains, so 
many that even the neighborhood 
cat named Max keeps his distance, 
and the girls that play never end-
ing games of jump rope in the mid-
dle of the street moving only for 
cars and groups of brisk walking 
women retreat indoors. Because I 
have lost the love my grandmother 
tied in necklaces around my neck 
and in scarves around my hair and 
she only appears in my dreams 
asking me why have I not stood 
at her grave, why have I not made 
prayers for a soul in purgatory, why 
have I not done so many things and 
I feel bare and raw and alone and 
as if my skin could give into the 
power of the sun and turn red and 
cracked in a way that it never could 
before. 

On love and loss

FILM REVIEW
TV REVIEW

Review: ‘The Chicago Seven’ ‘Someone has to die’ 

is compelling

On the night of Aug. 15, 2020, a 

Black Lives Matter protest marched 
through downtown Chicago. Hordes 
of police officers descended upon 
them, 
encircling 
small 
groups 

of people in a process known as 
“kettling.” They sprayed eyes with 
tear gas, beat limbs with batons and 
indiscriminately shot rubber bullets 
and arrested Americans whose only 
crime was exercising their First 
Amendment rights. Does this sound 
like America?

Unfortunately, it should. 
While the fascism on display in 

Chicago and many other American 
cities in the summer of 2020 may have 
seemed shockingly foreign to many 
Americans, it’s nothing new. It’s all 
happened before.

Aaron Sorkin’s (“Molly’s Game”) 

“The Trial of The Chicago Seven” 
is about another time when police 
smashed their way through American 
citizens: 1968, outside the Democratic 
National Convention in Chicago. A 
coalition of left-wing groups met to 
protest the Vietnam War and were 
denied permits by Chicago’s Mayor 
Richard Daley. When thousands of 
people took to the streets anyway, 
it didn’t take long for police officers 
to remove their badges and start 
smashing skulls. Nights of violence 
followed. 

The left was blamed, of course. 
After Richard Nixon won the 

Presidency, his administration held 
a show trial for seven disparate left-

wing leaders whose organizations 
attended 
the 
protests, 
including 

Tom Hayden from Students for a 
Democratic Society (SDS), played 
in the film by Eddie Redmayne 
(“Fantastic Beasts and Where to 
Find Them”), Jerry Rubin, played by 
Jeremy Strong (“Succession”) and 
Abbie Hoffman, played by Sacha 
Baron Cohen (“Borat”), of The Yippies 
and Bobby Seale, played by Yahya 
Abdul-Mateen 
II 
(“Watchmen”), 

of the Black Panthers. They were 
accused of planning a “radical left” 
conspiracy. 

The 
language 
of 
reactionary 

conservatism hasn’t changed, and 
neither has its baselessness. There 
was no conspiracy, and the groups 
behind the “Chicago Seven” simply 
protested together. That didn’t stop 
the trial from going on for months, 
though, and ruining entire lives. 

“The Trial of The Chicago Seven” 

is the rarest of courtroom dramas: 
one that shows the limits, and even 
total failure, of the American justice 
system.

The 
performances 
roar 
with 

urgency, especially the scene-stealing 
Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.

Sacha Baron Cohen also effortlessly 

inhabits 
the 
radical, 
drug-fueled 

Yippie Abbie Hoffman who, like 
Cohen in real life, stirred up trouble to 
display the absurdity of the American 
establishment.

For a writer and director known 

for his unrelenting, machine-gun 
dialogue and idiosyncratic characters, 
Aaron Sorkin shows an unusual 
amount of restraint here. Unlike “The 
Newsroom,” his characters rarely 

sound like Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin, for 
the most part, keeps all the brouhaha 
to a minimum and instead lets history 
take the stage. The fluidity of his 
direction, which allows the camera 
to drift from a closeup to a long take 
in one shot, also keeps scenes riveting 
when the dialogue inevitably piles up. 

“Chicago Seven” has moments of 

cheese that might make a cynical eye 
roll, but even the most schmaltzy of 
its scenes have a gobsmacking power 
in this nation’s current, troubled 
atmosphere. While Sorkin made the 
genius choice to intercut scenes with 
news footage and photographs from 
’68, rooting the film in brutal reality, 
there are moments, especially when 
downtown Chicago is filled with 
tear gas and riot-geared national 
guardsmen, that the movie could be 
about the summer of 2020. 

“The Trial of The Chicago Seven” 

is a call to arms that could not have 
come at a better time. Released just 
weeks before the 2020 election, it 
shows how corrupt, racist, oppressive 
and downright silly the American 
government can be at a time when it’s 
at its most corrupt, racist, oppressive 
and downright silly. 

The film displays the destruction 

wrought 
when 
America’s 
law 

enforcement 
and 
justice 
system 

overstep their bounds and persecute 
who they should protect. It shows 
how the American right to protest 
is vital to democracy, and how it can 
perhaps even save America itself. 

This is the history lesson this 

country needs right now.

Rating pop culture’s canines

The phrase “all dogs go to heaven” has 

been tossed around a lot. Most notably, the 
popular 1989 animated film of the same 
name leads us to believe that all dogs, 
regardless of behavior or upbringing, are 
deemed “good” in the eyes of society. This 
is simply and unequivocally false. Some 
dogs are good. Others aren’t. Today, I’d like 
to review the profiles of some recognizable 
canine characters throughout popular 
culture in order to deduce whether or not 
these childhood icons are worthy of our 
reciprocated affection. 

Toto from “The Wizard of Oz”
The Cairn Terrier that portrayed 

Dorothy’s companion Toto in the 1939 
film “The Wizard of Oz” was in fact a 
dog actress named Terry. In classic prima 
donna fashion, Terry was paid a salary of 
$125 per week for her work on the film. 
I’m pretty sure that’s more than what 
the Munchkins got offered. Surprisingly 
enough, her toe was accidentally stepped 
on and broken by a Munchkin actor, so 
they didn’t even use her for the whole 
movie shoot – lame. After the film’s 
success, her owner had an autobiography 
published for her titled “I, Toto,” which 
is pretty egotistical, even for a dog. Terry 
passed away in 1945, but her grave was 
later demolished to free space for the 
ventura highway in Los Angeles.

Evaluation: Terry was a classic 

Hollywood elite, and is therefore a Bad 
Dog.

Balto 
The 1995 animated movie “Balto” 

is inspired by the real life story of a 
Siberian Husky of the same name. A 
sled dog belonging to musher Leonhard 
Seppala, Balto gained fame in 1925 after 
leading his sled team on a medicine run 
from Anchorage to Nenana, Alaska, in 
order to combat a diphtheria outbreak. 
Ten months later, a statue of Balto was 
erected in New York’s Central Park, 
where he was present for the statue’s 
unveiling. After Balto died in 1933, his 
remains were mounted by a taxidermist 
and donated to the Cleveland Museum 
of Natural History, where his body still 
resides today (creepy).

Evaluation: 
Controversy 
still 

surrounds whether or not Balto was 
actually the lead dog on his own sled 
team, based on other mushers’ claims 
about the dog’s track record. Still – it’s 
much easier to live in blissful ignorance 
and assume that Balto is in fact a Good 
Dog.

Clifford the Big Red Dog
Clifford is a big red dog. What more is 

there to say? He is a menace to society. 
His size is often inconsistent: While he 
is shown being about 25 feet tall from 
paws to head, Clifford can appear much 
larger in picture books and television. 
His owner, Emily Howard, often rides 
him like a horse. The two live in New 
York City, where keeping a dog of 

normal proportions is already a logistical 
nightmare. The creators of the show of the 
same name have confirmed that Clifford 
can grow and shrink depending on the 
life force of the children around him. I 
can only deduce from this information 
that Clifford must be a mutant.

Evaluation: Clifford is a monstrosity, 

a mistake of human hubris. He must be 
stopped. He’s a Bad Dog.

McGruff the Crime Dog
McGruff the Crime Dog is an 

anthropomorphic animated bloodhound 
created by advertising agency Dancer 
Fitzgerald Sample in the 1980s to spread 
crime awareness and personal safety 
information, usually through the ad 
council. The same advertising agency 
is famous for inventing the Wendy’s 
commercial tagline “Where’s the beef?”. 
McGruff sounds like he smokes two 
packs of cigarettes a day and labels 
himself as a crime “Pre-tective,” which is 
not a job. Aside from being a total narc, I 
don’t think McGruff ever prevented any 
real crimes, and was merely a totem to 
deal with manufactured public fear over 
rising homicides in the late 1970s.

Evaluation: As much as I’d love to 

follow his advice and “Take a bite out of 
crime,” I am admittedly very frail. No 
amount of preparation could equip me to 
defend against a home invader. And for 
the most part, I trust my neighbors – Bad 
Dog.

Air Buddy
After some research, I discovered that 

Air Buddy is the true name of the athletic 
golden retriever featured in the 1997 
sports comedy film “Air Bud.” Prior to 
being given his franchise name, he was 
known as “Old Blue,” and serves as the 
companion of an alcoholic clown. I wish 
I was making that up. After being given 
to and consequently rescued from the 
pound, his new owner Josh discovers his 
uncanny ability to play basketball. Buddy 
ends up leading Josh’s middle school 
team to a championship victory. The 
movie grossed $28 million dollars, and 
the rest is history. In the 1998 sequel, “Air 
Bud: Golden Receiver,” it turns out Buddy 
is also incredibly skilled at American 
football.

Evaluation: I am glad this dog is not 

real because he’s clearly much more 
coordinated than me. Good Dog.

Scooby-Doo
Scooby-Doo 
is 
the 
eponymous 

character 
and 
protagonist 
of 
the 

animated television franchise “Scooby-
Doo,” created in 1969 by the American 
animation 
company 
Hanna-Barbera. 

He is a male Great Dane and lifelong 
companion of his owner, amateur 
detective Shaggy Rogers. The duo love 
to eat tall stacks of club sandwiches and 
run away from monsters. He can also 
talk sometimes, which is pretty cool. The 
2002 live action film “Scooby-Doo” — 
y’know, the one where the gang travels to 
a haunted resort island, and Scooby’s pure 
protoplasmic soul is nearly sacrificed via 
cult ritual — remains a hallmark of early 

2000s cinema.

Evaluation: How can you not love 

Scooby? Good Dog.

Scrappy-Doo
Take everything you love about 

Scooby-Doo and throw it out the window. 
Scrappy-Doo is the complete opposite. 
Introduced to the franchise in 1979 
as Scooby’s nephew, Scrappy is quite 
possibly the most annoying addition to 
any children’s cartoon franchise. Scrappy 
has no basic, subtle, relatable or even 
recognizable character traits with which 
viewers can connect. His whole schtick 
is that he can talk without a speech 
impediment, unlike his uncle Scooby. 
While his smarts often help to advance 
the plot, Scrappy’s shrill and high-pitched 
voice gets easily rattled into your brain. 
Even after encountering hundreds of life-
or-death situations, he still thinks he can 
beat up the monsters himself as per his 
signature one liner: “Let me at ’em!”

Evaluation: The idea for this dog 

should’ve stayed in the boardroom. Bad 
Dog.

Snoopy
If you have no clue who Snoopy is, I 

don’t know why you bothered to get this 
far into my article. Snoopy is a beagle 
who belongs to Charlie Brown, the main 
character from a comic strip franchise 
that hasn’t made anything new in a very 
long time. I digress. Snoopy is a black 
and white beagle who spends his free 
time imagining alternate lives, including 
being an author, a college student known 
as “Joe Cool,” an attorney and a British 
World War I flying ace. He constantly 
refers to his owner as “that round-headed 
kid” and has seven brothers. Snoopy’s red 
doghouse defies the laws of physics, and 
is shown to be bigger on the inside than 
the outside.

Evaluation: Snoopy might be a dog, 

but his acuity for extreme wonder and 
boredom encapsulates the vast expanses 
of the human condition. Begrudgingly, 
he’s a Good Dog.

Dressed in expensive fashion, the 

first characters we meet in the new 
Netflix mini-series “Someone Has to 
Die” are Cayetana (Ester Expósito, 
“Elite”) and her brother Alonso 
(Carlos 
Cuevas, 
“Merlí. 
Sapere 

Aude”), who pass time shooting 
pigeons 
at 
their 
family 
range. 

Cayetana tells her brother that 
someone named Gabino has finally 
returned to marry her. He freezes. 
Before we can decide whether it’s out 
of anger or worry, Alonso takes aim, 
screams and shoots. 

Frantic violins guide us through 

a wealthy home. Regal, yet sinister. 
It’s a place where appearances are 
kept, 
traditions 
are 
prioritized 

and unadjusted newcomers are not 
welcome. So it’s no surprise that when 
Gabino (Alejandro 
Speitzer, “Enemigo 
Íntimo”) 
returns 

with Lázaro (Isaac 
Hernández), 
an 

attractive Mexican 
ballet 
dancer, 

their 
friendship 

becomes a magnet 
for accusations of 
homosexuality.

“Someone Has to 

Die” is the follow 
up effort of Manolo 
Caro, who debuted 
his 
critically 

acclaimed dramedy 
series “The House 
of 
Flowers” 
in 

2018. 
With 
this 

new three-episode 
mini-series, 
Caro 

has 
ditched 
the 

humor and amped 
up the drama for 
a 
period 
piece 

about 
wealthy 

conservatism 
during 
Spain’s 

Franco regime. 

Ten years before 

his return, Gabino 
was sent to live in 
Mexico. His arrival in Spain marks 
the first time anyone has seen 
him since he was a child. Within 
the context of the series, the two 
countries represent very different 
ways of life. Spain is a world where 
manners 
and 
practicality 
pump 

through its veins like venom. There 
are strict expectations of how one 
should behave, and if anyone dares 
try to wrinkle its “perfect” image, 
every pillar of its structure is 
designed to eradicate them. Mexico 
represents the opposite. It’s a free 
world with less money, less rules and 
more personal expression. To Spain, 
its very existence is a plague to be 
spat on and forced into submission. 

Gabino’s time there has given him 

pride and clarity: two traits that 
prove particularly dangerous. He’s 
not insecure about his sexuality or 
his right to express it. He’s able to 
see his family’s manipulation for 
what it is, and his refusal to submit 
to it means that it’s only a matter 
of time before the systems of Spain 
weed him out.

To 
make 
matters 
far 
worse, 

Gabino’s father, Gregorio (Ernesto 
Alterio, “Unknown Origins”), also 
happens to be in the least convenient 

profession 
possible: 
managing 
a 

facility that imprisons, overworks 
and tortures homosexuals. 

This 
dynamic 
of 
being 
a 

homosexual in a world that is 
hell-bent on destroying anything 
different is where most of the show’s 
tension comes from. It’s a structure 
that is so simple and so effective that 
it stands to point out how limited 
stories there are about the plight 
of LGBTQ+ members. Whether in 
Spain, America or anywhere else 
in the world, there is so much more 
progress that needs to be made in 
the fight for gender and sexuality 
justice. 

There are two sides to Gabino’s 

family, and their contrast is not 
unlike the one between Spain and 
Mexico. Gregorio is a product of 
his 
mother. 
Cold-blooded, 
and 

deeply instilled with the virtue that 
business and beliefs come before 

love. 
Gregorio’s 

wife, Mina (Cecilia 
Suárez, 
“The 

House of Flowers”) 
is 
more 
in 
line 

with 
Mexico. 

She’s 
passionate, 

understanding and 
prioritizes her love 
for her child over 
all else. To Gabino, 
Mina is the only 
human 
being 
in 

their rich Spanish 
society that accepts 
him for who he is. 
In this way, she 
is the sole beacon 
of 
hope 
for 
his 

happiness.

There 
is 
so 

much 
about 
this 

show that works 
well. It’s carefully 
constructed, 
sufficiently 
engaging 
and 

unafraid to make 
artistic 
choices 

when it wants to 
deliver an emotion. 
The 
score, 
as 

mentioned before, 

is fantastic. Recurring haunting, 
anxiety-ridden strings paint such a 
vivid portrait of affluent tension. In 
fact, there’s no aspect of the show 
at all that comes off as particularly 
weak. 

However, 
“Someone 
Has 
to 

Die” lacks a certain vigor which 
keeps it from being one of the more 
memorable projects to debut this 
year. The culprit may be its format. 
With 
only 
three, 
approximately 

hour-long episodes, the finale feels 
rushed. The first two episodes were 
wonderfully paced, but by its ending 
I wished that Caro had taken it 
further. So many interesting seeds 
were planted for each character that 
never got the pay off they deserved. 
Because of the lack of time, the series 
became 
more 
plot-focused 
than 

character-based, and it lost out on a 
lot of opportunities for hard-hitting 
moments as a result.

Though it may not have reached its 

full potential, “Someone Has to Die” 
does a compelling job at exploring an 
important piece of LGBTQ+ history.

With this three-

episode mini-series, 

Caro has ditched 
the humor and 
amped up the 

drama for a period 
piece about wealthy 

conservatism 
during Spain’s 
Fraco regime.
