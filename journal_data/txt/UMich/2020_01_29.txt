Nikole 
Hannah-Jones, 
domestic correspondent for The 
New York Times Magazine and 
creator of the NYT 1619 Project, 
compared slavery to the red pill 
in the movie, “The Matrix.” As 
Hannah- Jones described it, the 
legacy of slavery in America is 
“the coding and the architecture 
of everything that we see, and 
we have been allowing this 

country to pretend that slavery 
is marginal to the American 
story.” 
Tuesday night, The Wallace 
House 
hosted 
Hannah-Jones 
for a dialogue with Rochelle 
Riley, a 2008 Knight-Wallace 
Fellow, City of Detroit Arts and 
Culture director and longtime 
columnist at the Detroit Free 
Press. Hannah-Jones spoke to a 
packed Rackham Auditorium. 
The 1619 Project is an ongoing 
initiative by The New York Times 

Magazine, discussing the history 
of slavery in America, its legacy 
within 
the 
Consitution, 
the 
miseducation of American youth 
and the modern implications 
of 
America’s 
discriminatory 
history. The project also includes 
a five episode podcast. The 
project, released in August 2019, 
marked the 400th anniversary 
of institutional slavery, when 
The White Lion ship brought 
over 20 enslaved Africans to the 
English Colony of Virginia in 

August 1619.
Throughout 
the 
talk, 
Hannah-Jones 
discussed 
the 
gruesome existence of slavery in 
American culture. She answered 
audience 
questions 
bluntly, 
jokingly exclaiming “no” when 
an audience member asked if she 
had a “sense that a real reckoning 
is happening in our communities 
and in our systems” because of 
the 1619 project.

The University of Michigan 
issued a travel warning for the 
city of Wuhan in China’s Hubei 
Province 
Monday 
afternoon 
following 
the 
outbreak 
of 
coronavirus, a rapidly spreading 
new virus. With the warning, 
undergraduate 
students 
may 
not travel to the region and must 
prepare a safety plan to study in 
other areas in China, according 
to an email sent to all University 
faculty, students and staff.
The 
novel 
coronavirus 
strain, 
also 
known 
as 
the 
Wuhan coronavirus, transmits 
quickly. 
According 
to 
the 

Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention, symptoms for the 
Wuhan coronavirus can present 
themselves between two and 14 
days after exposure and include 
fever, coughing and shortness of 
breath.
The 
virus 
broke 
out 
in 
December 2019 in the city 
of Wuhan in China’s Hubei 
Province, and the exact number 
of cases has not been confirmed. 
The Chinese government has 
locked 
down 
several 
cities 
including Wuhan, prohibiting 
travel into or out of quarantined 
destinations. 
There 
are 
multiple 
international confirmed cases 
of 
the 
Wuhan 
coronavirus, 
including a few in the United 

States. According to the World 
Health 
Organization, 
all 
coronaviruses 
are 
zoonotic, 
meaning they are transferred 
between humans and animals. 
The Wuhan coronavirus has 
not previously been identified 
in humans, and many of the 
people who have been infected 
frequented the Huanan seafood 
wholesale market in the city.
Mary 
Gallagher, 
political 
science professor and director 
of the Lieberthal-Rogel Center 
for Chinese Studies, said there 
was an apparent initial effort 
on the part of the local Wuhan 
government to cover up the 
severity of the outbreak. Since 
the central Chinese government 
was made aware of the situation, 

its response has been efficient 
and 
effective, 
especially 
compared to their actions in 
2003 after the outbreak of SARS, 
or 
severe 
acute 
respiratory 
syndrome.
“The government in Wuhan 
seemed reluctant to alert the 
central authorities and public 
health authorities to the severity 
of the breakout in Wuhan and 
the evidence for human to 
human transmission,” Gallagher 
said. 
“The 
Chinese 
central 
government now has reacted 
very aggressively to do some 
things that seem amazing and 
excellent, like building a bunch 
of hospitals as quickly as they 

The University of Michigan 
honored three recipients of 
the Distinguished University 
Professorship on Tuesday at the 
Ross School of Business to an 
audience of about 100 students, 
faculty and staff.
The University established 
the Distinguished University 
Professorships 
in 
1947 
to 
recognize professors with a 
noteworthy 
commitment 
to 
academia. 
Those 
bestowed 
with the honor serve as models 
of success in research, teaching 
and community leadership to 
faculty and students.
In 
his 
opening 
remarks, 
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
spoke 
on 
the 
importance of talented faculty 
in academia.
“A university can only be as 
great as its faculty,” Schlissel 
said.
Each 
professor 
presented 
topics related to their research. 
John 
M.

the 
Richard Boland Distinguished 
University Professor of Internal 
Medicine and Human Genetics, 
spoke on DNA mismatch repair,

The University of Michigan 
Central Student Government 
released a statement on Jan. 26 
announcing that they passed 
a resolution demanding the 
University freeze all of its 
fossil fuel investments and 
commit to divestment in 2020. 
The resolution was brought 
up at the Association of Big 
Ten Students Conference this 
past weekend in Bloomington, 
Ind. The association includes 
representatives from each of 
the Big Ten schools’ student 
governments. 
“With 
a 
collective 
representation of over 500,000 
students across 14 universities, 
ABTS is a critical organization 
that can be used to push 
for 
concrete, 
institutional 
change,” the statement read. 
“CSG urges the University of 
Michigan Board of Regents 
and 
Executive 
Officers 
to 
stand up for climate justice. 
Hundreds of thousands of 
students 
and 
millions 
of 
alumni are watching.”
The 
resolution 
passed 
unanimously. 

Each month, The Michigan 
Daily’s Administration Beat 
sits down with University 
of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel to discuss important 
questions about University 
policy, 
commitments 
and 
challenges. Topics discussed 
in this month’s interview 
included 
Provost 
Martin 
Philbert, 
divestment 
from 
fossil fuels, the President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality, the discrimination 
lawsuit 
filed 
against 
the 
University and more. 
This month, we used input 
from the campus community 
to guide our questions for 
Schlissel. 
Stay 
tuned 
for 
next month’s interview to 
submit your questions. This 

interview has been edited and 
condensed for clarity. 
Provost Philbert
The 
Michigan 
Daily: 
On Jan. 22, you sent an 
email to the entire student 
body informing them about 
several allegations of sexual 
misconduct 
by 
Provost 
Philbert. 
Public 
Affairs 
confirmed on Thursday that 
Philbert was on medical leave 
for part of the fall semester. 
I’m aware that his health is 
his personal business. I’m 
more curious as to why this 
administrative leave was not 
widely communicated to the 
campus community given 
the high-profile nature of 
Philbert’s position?
Mark Schlissel: Health 
is a very private matter. It 
affects the Provost. It affects 
his family. It doesn’t affect 
you and me; it’s his health. 
So, we have great respect

With Ann Arbor rent prices 
skyrocketing 
and 
student 
voter turnout flatlining, the 
University of Michigan Central 
Student 
Government 
met 
Tuesday night in the Michigan 
Union to pass resolutions to 
renew a taskforce researching 
a student tenants union and 
to discuss CSG and national 
election reform. 
Because 
Ann 
Arbor 
rent 
has 
increased 
at 
a 
yearly 
rate of nearly 16 percent, the 
Assembly passed a resolution 
reauthorizing 
the 
Student 
Tenants Union taskforce to 
research the structure and 
demand for a student tenant’s 
union. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Sam 
Burnstein said the end goal 
for the taskforce is to create a 
tenant’s union with full-time 
staff to advocate on behalf of 
students, assist students with 

searching 
for 
housing 
and 
answer questions on topics 
from renting to roommates. 
“This idea for a Student 
Tenants Union was really born 
out of two issues most students 
on campus face in some way,” 
Burstein said. “The first being 
affordability, and the second, 
really, is a deficit of information 
regarding renting.” 
Burnstein 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
advocacy, 
especially since four of the five 
seats up for election in the Ann 
Arbor City Council went to 
“anti-housing candidates” last 
year, each of which were won 
with less than 1 percent of the 
vote. 
“At the core of this issue are 
terrible laws and regulations 
in the city of Ann Arbor, 
particularly 
zoning 
codes, 
height 
limits 
on 
buildings, 
where buildings can be built 
(and) how the city council 
approves which buildings can 
be built,” Burstein said. 

The 
Assembly 
passed 
a 
resolution 22-5 to include an 
author’s summary and FAQ 
section 
within 
resolutions 
to 
increase 
accessibility 
to students, the press and 
Assembly members themselves. 
Burstein said these additions 
would 
help 
readers 
better 
understand CSG’s work. 
“This definitely would help 
students read, understand and 
interpret 
our 
resolutions,” 
Burstein said. 
Engineering 
sophomore 
Carla Voigt raised concerns the 
summaries would discourage 
Assembly 
members 
from 
reading resolutions in their 
entireties. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Sam Braden approved of an 
FAQ section but worried about 
members maliciously excluding 
certain details from a summary. 
“An author’s summary is 
actually 
dangerous, 
while 
an FAQ is not,” Braden said. 
“It is a lot more difficult to 
abuse an FAQ than an author’s 

summary.” 
Engineering senior Mario 
Galindez disagreed, noting the 
resolution gives the committee 
the ability to edit the summary 
at every stage. 
“No mechanism can’t be 
abused,” Galindez said. “I think 
in everything there’s room for 
abuse, and I think there’s a 
good check here, which is the 
committee structure.” 
The 
Assembly 
debated 
a 
resolution 
allowing 
faculty 
to 
grant 
students 
excused 
absences on national election 
days if they have significant 
barriers 
to 
voting 
due 
to 
transportation limitations or 
class schedule. It was ultimately 
sent back to its creators to be 
revised. 
Additionally, the Assembly 
passed resolutions supporting 
carbon-neutral 
facilities 
on 
campus and ensuring party 
names are not listed alongside 
candidate names on the CSG 
ballot.

New model aims to streamline meetings, impact method for discussing potential resolutions 

Central Student Government discusses 
tenants’ union, new voting process

Jan. 29, 1978: Human rights law looks to eliminate discrimination 
within housing, employment, investing in Ann Arbor

Ann Arbor’s going to be a mighty 
tough place for businesses who 
practice discrimination in housing, 
employment and investment if a 
hard nosed new city human rights 
ordinance wins final approval from 
City Council.
The new ordinance, which would 
extend the protection of the law 
to pregnant women, families with 
small children and recipients of 
public assistance, was accepted at 
first reading during council’s Jan. 9 
meeting. If passed, it would be one 
of the most comprehensive laws of its 
kind in the country.

ANN ARBOR- ALREADY has a 
human rights ordinance-- a much-
amended patchwork affair dating 
back to the Democratic-Human 
Rights Party Council of 1970. But city 
officials have been complaining for a 
long time that the present ordinance 
is confusing and unenforceable.
The purpose of the new ordinance 
is to cut down on the excessive 
verbiage of the present law,” said 
Byron Marshall, who as special 
assistant 
to 
City 
Administrator 
Sylvester Murray was one of the main 
architects of the proposed ordinance. 
But the new law would do much more 

than simply clean up a few language 
problems; as it now stands, it would:
Widen the categories of people 
protected 
against 
disrcimination 
to 
include 
prohibitions 
against 
discrimination 
for 
race, 
color, 
religion, national origin, sex, age, 
marital status, sexual prefernce, 
family responsibilities, educational 
association, 
physical 
limitations, 
source 
of 
income, 
personal 
associations and pregnancy;
Define more clearly the number 
and kind of discriminatory practices 
prohibited by law;
Place added emphasis on specific 

penalties 
for 
companies 
and 
individuals found guilty of violating 
the ordinance (up to a $500 fine and/
or 90 days in jail);
Forbid unions to discriminate in 
apprenticeship and other training 
programs; and,
Prohibit any form of retaliation 
against 
individuals 
who 
bring 
complaints to the city under the 
ordinance.
CERTAIN TYPES of “justified” 
discrimination--sororities 
and 
fraternities for instance--would be 
exempted from compliance. But the 
overall effect of the new ordinance 

would be to pack some muscle into 
the city’s antidiscrimination efforts.
“I think we’re going to come 
through 
with 
a 
pretty 
good 
ordinance,” 
said 
Mayor 
Albert 
Wheeler, who has identified himself 
very closely with the proposed law, 
and has vowed to veto the ordinance 
if council passes a diluted version.
The ordinance could also go a long 
way toward reviving the city’s long-
dormant Human Rights Commision 
and Human Rights Department.
The Human Rights Commission-
-a Council-appointed body whose 
purpose was originally to make 

policy 
recommendations 
to 
the 
Mayor and Council--was allowed to 
fall into disuse over the last few years. 
The Human Rights Department-
-a 
city 
administrative 
agency 
which was intended to investigate 
discrimination and enforce the 1970 
ordinance-was widely criticized for 
its ineffectiveness, and was divested 
of its department status in July 1976.
UNDER 
THE 
CITY 
reorganization 
plan 
adopted 
by 
Council earlier this month, the 
Human Rights Department has been 
reestablished under Murray’s direct 
supervision.

the privacy involved. It 
was in the meeting materials 
for the Dec. 15 or so Regents 
meeting, so it’s in the public 
domain. But because it was 
about 
a 
personal 
health 
matter, I didn’t think it rose 
to the level of informing the 
community. An acting provost 
was in place, and I was in 
place and the business of the 
University continued. 
TMD: The email you sent to 
students said the University 
received “several allegations 
of 
sexual 
misconduct 
by 
Dr. Philbert” on Jan. 16-17 
of 2020. I’m curious about 
what 
exactly 
this 
means. 
Was Jan. 16 the first time 
the 
University 
was 
made 
aware of Philbert’s alleged 
sexual misconduct, or is it a 
technical way of describing 
a step in a reporting process 

that actually began earlier 
than Jan. 16? 
MS: We take allegations 
of sexual misconduct with 
the utmost seriousness, the 
16th and the 17th was the 
first I became aware of any 
allegation 
whatsoever. 
We, 
because of the high rank of the 
person and the fact that we all 
know each other very well and 
work together very closely, 
the general counsel decided 
it was wisest to immediately 
bring in an outside law firm to 
help us investigate. And over 
the course of the first several 
days of that investigation, 
we learned enough that the 
allegations 
were 
credible, 
and as a result, to allow the 
investigation 
to 
proceed 
completely, and to assure the 
ongoing safety in the comfort 
of the community the Provost 
was put on leave. And then we 
announced what we had done. 
That’s basically what I said 

in the statement, and that’s 
basically all I can say because 
there’s always a presumption 
of 
innocence. 
Everyone 
deserves due process and a 
full investigation. I want to 
give tremendous thanks and 
credit to the people who have 
stepped up and told us about 
their experiences. That takes 
a lot of bravery to do that. It’s 
an act of giving, because it 
helps others in the community 
either feel comfortable to 
step up themselves or feel 
like 
they’re 
being 
safer. 
We provided access to all 
the different modalities of 
support for the folks that 
made 
these 
reports. 
And 
we’re trying to deal with it as 
sensitively as possible while 
keeping the business of the 
University moving forward.
TMD: How is it that the 
University received several 
allegations on the same day 
without any prior knowledge 

of the situation?
MS: It’s interesting. I don’t 
know the answer. And so, 
perhaps during the course of 
the investigation, we’ll figure 
that out. But I don’t know why 
we received several over the 
space of a couple of days.
TMD: I was wondering if 
you could tell me a little bit 
more about what exactly he 
did, given he oversaw the 
Office of Institutional Equity?
MS: The Provost oversees 
a huge swath of the entire 
institution. He is the Chief 
Budget 
Officer 
and 
the 
Chief Academic Officer for 
the whole University. OIE, 
because of its importance, 
we changed its reporting line 
a year ago, to report directly 
to the Provost’s Office. We 
did that to make sure that it 
receives the resources that it 
needs and the attention that it

Engineering 
sophomore 
Carla Voigt, the University’s liaison 
to the ABTS, said the passage of 
the proposal aligns with CSG’s past 
actions.
“We really just wanted to 
get the other Big Ten schools to 
be a part of the same thing that 
we were investigating, pulling 
out of investments in fossil fuel 
industries,” Voigt said. “It’s not 
unlike claims that we have made 
in the past or actions that we have 
done, like when we divested from 
the tobacco industry in 2000.”
Voigt said the legislation works 
hand in hand with other proposals 
passed at the conference, such as 
the University of Indiana’s proposal 
to create a sustainability committee.
The Climate Action Movement 
has been a big proponent of 
pressuring 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan to divest in the past year. 
They released a statement Tuesday 

in support of CSG’s resolution. 
Engineering senior Logan Vear, 
member of the Climate Action 
Movement and member of the 
President’s Commission on Carbon 
Neutrality, signed the statement.
“Today, students of the Big 
Ten have sent a clear message to 
the nation: the time has come for 
universities to act on the urgency 
of the climate crisis,” Vear wrote. 
“Divestment from the harmful 
fossil fuel industry can and must 
be normalized across the nation’s 
public-facing institutions.”
Vear compared calls to divest 
from fossil fuels to past massive 
student 
protests 
when 
the 
University divested from apartheid 
South Africa and the tobacco 
industry.
“The University of Michigan 
has precedent in this regard — 
past 
Administrations 
divested 
from apartheid South Africa and 
the tobacco industry after robust 
student-led activism,” Vear wrote. 
“Divesting the $1 billion U-M has 
invested in the fossil fuel industry 

requires the same moral urgency.”
Abdul El-Sayed, politician and 
runner up in the 2018 Michigan 
gubernatorial election, tweeted his 
praise for the resolution.
“This is a big deal,” El-Sayed 
wrote. “Our young leaders know 
what’s at stake. And they know 
what our major institutions need to 
be doing to defend us.”
Voigt said she was surprised but 
glad to see the support the proposal 
has gained among students as the 
issue of climate change is pressing. 
She said she is hopeful other work 
CSG and the ABTS does also 
receives similar attention.
“It’s definitely surprising, but at 
the same time, it’s also kind of not 
surprising because it is something 
that is really important,” Voigt 
said. “It’s really good to see it 
gain traction. I hope that some of 
the other things that we do gain 
traction in the future.”

can and decoding the genomic 
structure of the virus.”
Gallagher also commented on 
the quarantine of Wuhan city 
and several others in province, 
noting potential shortcomings of 
this strategy. 
“The 
problem 
with 
the 
quarantine is that the quarantine 
comes after this period of local 
coverup and a huge exodus of 
people 
from 
Wuhan, 
partly 
probably because of the fear 
of the virus, but also because 
Chinese New Year was about to 
happen and people were going 
home to celebrate the holiday,” 
Gallagher said. “So, it’s not really 
clear to me that the quarantine 
is going to stop the virus from 
spreading.” 
Adam Lauring, an infectious 
disease specialist at Michigan 
Medicine, described the likely 
origin of the virus in humans 

as well as likely first treatment 
steps.
“Based 
on 
the 
sequences 
that are out now and have been 
analyzed, there was probably one 
animal to human spillover event 
that happened probably in late 
November or early December, 
and since then the virus has 
been spreading from person to 
person,” Lauring said. “The first 
thing they’re probably doing is 
a lot of what we call ‘supportive 
care.’ The biggest issue is that 
it 
apparently 
causes 
a 
bad 
pneumonia or lung infection, 
and the thing that most people 
would be needing would be help 
with their breathing.”
On 
Monday, 
University 
students 
received 
an 
email 
from 
the 
University 
Health 
Service concerning the novel 
coronavirus.
In the email, Preeti Malani, 
University of Michigan Chief 
Health 
Officer, 
wrote 
the 
University is closely monitoring 
the situation and the risk is 

minimal at this time. 
“While 
there 
are 
some 
confirmed cases in the U.S., 
no cases have been confirmed 
in Michigan,” Malani wrote. 
“Of the four potential cases in 
southeast Michigan that were 
recently submitted for testing, 
three have come back negative 
for the virus. University officials 
are monitoring the remaining 
case 
closely 
in 
partnership 
with local and state public 
health experts. At this time, 
the immediate health risk from 
2019-nCoV to the general public 
in the U.S. is considered low.”
In his email to the University, 
Malani wrote there are no 
confirmed cases of the virus 
in Michigan and out of three 
potential cases sent for testing, 
three came back negative. 
Lauring 
elaborated, 
saying 
hospitals and clinics in the 
University area are employing 
careful screening procedures to 
ensure that any potential cases 
are recognized and the threat of 

infection is minimized.
“People at the medical center 
and clinics, everyone’s being 
screened (who has) traveled in 
the past few weeks to try and 
identify people who might be at 
risk or might have an illness that 
could be due to the coronavirus,” 
Lauring said. “That is probably 
the biggest thing that’s going 
on here is just making sure that 
potential cases are evaluated 
and making sure that we’re 
not missing anyone that could 
potentially bring the virus here 
or spread it here.”
The University of Michigan 
has 
contacted 
all 
travelers 
registered to be in China or 
traveling there in the upcoming 
months 
and 
designated 
a 
University travel warning for 
China, in addition to convening a 
team of experts to monitor new 
developments. The same post 
clarified that currently there 
are 
no 
University-registered 
travelers going to the Hubei 
province at this time. 

In an email to The Daily, 
University spokesperson Kim 
Broekhuizen noted there are no 
University students currently in 
the province.
Michigan University Health 
Services 
has 
created 
an 
information page for the 2019 
novel coronavirus containing 
general 
information 
about 
transmission as well as avoidance 
and risk. According to UHS, the 
Center for Disease Control has 
been monitoring the virus and 
do not see it as an active threat 
to the U.S.
The lack of knowledge about 
the coronavirus outbreak is the 
main reason there is currently 
no vaccine. As a result, the 
future risks associated with 
this particular strain remain 
ambiguous. 
Lauring 
said 
a 
vaccine could potentially be 
developed, but the analysis and 
testing required will require 
several months of research.
“We’re probably months away 
at least from a vaccine,” Lauring 

said. “There’s a number of what 
would be called platforms for 
coronavirus 
vaccines 
where 
people have tried to develop 
vaccines for other coronaviruses, 
so what they would do would 
be modifying those approaches 
specifically for this new virus.”
Michigan Medicine volunteer 
Natalie White, LSA sophomore, 
said 
she 
trusts 
clinics 
and 
hospitals around the country to 
contain the virus’s spread.
“In general, I haven’t seen 
enough cases to personally feel 
concerned about it,” White said. 
“I have a pretty strong faith in 
Michigan Medicine and a lot 
of the medical establishments 
across 
the 
country 
that 
it 
shouldn’t be a huge deal. I feel 
like some people definitely are 
getting a little bit of hysteria 
surrounding it.”

Throughout the Magazine 
issue, the various essays argue 
the founding principles of the 
country — including liberty, 
equality and democracy — 
did not come to fruition when 
written into the Constitution. 
The 
practice 
of 
slavery 
contradicted these principles 
because 
Black 
Americans 
continuously fought for their 
democracy, 
Hannah-Jones 
said. She argues slavery is 
not only the foundation of 
American 
history, 
but 
is 
deeply embedded in society 
today through the country’s 
education, 
housing, 
health 
care systems and more. 
Hannah-Jones said she was 
inspired to write the series of 
essays because of the 400th 
anniversary 
of 
1619, 
and 
because she has been thinking 
about 1619 since high school 
when she took a Back studies 
course. She called attention 
to how frequently American 
youth 
learn 
about 
The 
Mayflower in 1620, but not 
about the arrival of The White 
Lion in 1619.
Hannah-Jones said the lack 
of education about The White 
Lion erases key moments in 
history, and the glorification of 
The Mayflower is an example 
of 
Americans 
choosing 
to 
remember 
only 
a 
positive 
perspective of their history. 
“(There’s) 
this 
idea 
of 
national memory,” Hannah-
Jones said. “How we create a 
sense of our history, who we 
are and what decisions are 
made about what we learn and 
what we don’t.” 
Hannah-Jones 
said 
she 
chose to focus on themes such 
as capitalism, healthcare, 
music and mass incarceration 
to shock readers about the 
modern 
implications 
of 
slavery. 
While Hannah-Jones has 
received accolades for her 
work, a group of historians 
publicly 
criticized 
the 
project, arguing it failed to 
properly address the origins 
of 
the 
Revolutionary 
War 
and 
Abraham 
Lincoln’s 
role 
in 
abolishing 
slavery. 
Additionally, 
Hannah-Jones 
said she received criticism 

for 
her 
statement 
that 
Black Americans fought for 
democracy alone. 
The New York Times issued 
a response to the historians, 
defending the factual backing 
of the project. Hannah-Jones 
said a minority of white people 
helped Black Americans in 
the fight for democracy, but 
most of the time, Black people 
fought 
independently 
for 
their 
rights. 
Hannah-Jones 
said 
she 
would 
ultimately 
not apologize for the way she 
framed her argument and the 
organizing principle of the 
U.S. is slavery, not democracy 
— people already know about 
the history of Lincoln, she 
said.
“The pushback is about the 
idea that even in the telling 
of our own story, we have to 
center the white people, and 
that we don’t give enough 
credit,” Hannah-Jones said. 
Hannah-Jones also spoke 
about the project’s personal 
effect on her. She became 
emotional when speaking of 
her grandmother, who was 
born in Mississippi and gave 
birth to Hannah-Jones’s father 
in a sharecropping shack on 
a plantation because Black 
people were not permitted 
to give birth in hospitals. 
Hannah-Jones 
said 
her 
grandmother died of diabetes, 
her father died before he 
was old enough to get social 
security benefits and her uncle 
died at 50 of cancer because he 
didn’t have insurance and in 
turn, couldn’t receive an MRI. 
“All I kept thinking was 
everyone was lost,” Hannah-
Jones said. “All lives still are 
lost because we can’t purge 
this 
anti-Blackness 
from 
our country. And then, I can 
somehow, everything that my 
grandmother 
suffered, 
she 
could not imagine that she 
had a grandchild who could 
do something like this in The 
New York Times.”
The 1619 Project has been 
adapted into an education 
curriculum. The project was 
sold and created into a series of 
books that go from elementary 
school, middle school, high 
school and adults. Hannah-
Jones is also currently working 
on marking slave auctioning 
sites in U.S. cities and creating 
a photojournalism series. 

Public Health student Janae 
Best 
appreciated 
Hannah-
Jones’s honesty and felt her 
thesis emphasized the pride 
Black Americans should feel 
about their place in the U.S.
“How truthful she was, 
how raw she was and how 
unapologetic she was about 
telling the truth that has been 
hidden for so long, and just 
reminding us of the fact that 
Black people have a right to 
this country,” Best said. “Even 
more so than white people do 
because of the fact that the 
country was founded based 
off of slavery. That was very 
empowering.” 

Rackham student Gabriel 
Gadsden applauded Hannah-
Jones for her frankness. 
“Just how frank she was 
and just how unapologetic she 
was,” Gadsden said. “It was a 
conversation, and I think that 
she truly embodied that. And I 
think that’s the conversation 
that we need to have about 
race in America … You know, 
at a certain point you just can’t 
sugarcoat it. You just have to 
say what it is. And if it’s going 
to make people uncomfortable, 
so be it, but that’s the best 
trajectory that we need to go 
in.”
Gadsden said he grew up 
with slavery as an important 
conversation 
at 
home. 
He 
said it is crucial to discuss 
unknown actors in history 
beyond the activists commonly 
discussed in textbooks.
“It’s always the right time 
to talk about slavery and to 
talk about it, not just through 
the lens of Martin Luther 
King and Malcolm X, and 
these big names, but as she was 
addressing, was that the unsung 
heroes,” Gadsden said. “About 
those people who names are 
forgotten, whose plantations 
have been whitewashed, to 
bring that to the forefront of 
the conversation as well.”
The purpose of the 1619 
Project, Hannah-Jones said, 
was indeed to celebrate unsung 
Black American heroes.
“This was about telling the 
story that people do not get, 
and this was about telling the 
story that Black Americans 
were not just sitting around 
waiting for equality,” Hannah-
Jones said. “That we fought 
every day.”

colorectal cancer.
“You have a normal colon 
that 
can 
develop 
(one 
of 
these) polyps — you can either 
have a germline mutation or 
develop somatic inactivation,” 
Carethers 
said. 
“Either 
possibility can affect DNA 
mismatch repair.” 
Anna 
Suk-Fong 
Lok, 
the Dame Sheila Sherlock 
Distinguished 
University 
Professor of Hepatology and 
Internal 
Medicine, 
began 
her career as a professor at 
the University of Hong Kong 
before deciding to move to the 
United States. She presented 
her work on viral hepatitis, 
of which the B and C strains 
are a leading cause of liver 
cancer.
Lok 
described 
her 
experience as a professor in 
medicine in the early 1990s. 

“In 1992, the chair of 
medicine told me to slow 
down because there was no 
more room to move up,” Lok 
said.
Lok went on to further 
explain 
her 
research 
on 
Hepatitis B and C. 
“These viruses can lead 
to 
chronic 
infection 
and 
cirrhosis, 
which 
means 
scarring of the liver, and in 
turn liver cancer,” Lok said. 
“Hepatitis B is more common 
globally, whereas Hepatitis 
C is more common in this 
country. Together, these two 
viruses result in roughly 1.2 
million deaths per year. This 
is the reason why, in 2015, the 
World Health Organization 
declared that we need to 
eliminate these viruses by 
2030.”
Scott E. Page, the John 
Seely Brown Distinguished 
University 
Professor 
of 
Complexity, Social Science 
and 
Management, 
then 

spoke about his research in 
cognitive 
diversity, 
which 
incorporates 
a 
fusion 
of 
different 
approaches 
to 
problem solving, including 
models.
“One of the things we do 
with models is we just explore 
the world,” Page said. 
Page 
then 
spoke 
about 
diversity, noting how it is 
closely related to accuracy.
“So, 
then 
here’s 
the 
question: Is more diversity 
better?” Page said. “As I ramp 
up diversity, you can just see 
accuracy go up.”
Business graduate student 
Gautam 
Kandlikar 
is 
one 
of Page’s students and said 
he found the lecture series 
inspiring.
“They’re 
gathering 
data, 
they’re 
analyzing 
systems, 
they’re creating new knowledge 
that helps us advance society, 
and 
I 
think 
that’s 
really 
fascinating,” Kandlikar said. 
“That’s really inspiring.”

needs. 
The 
provost’s 
role 
though, is as a supervisor of 
the employees in the office. 
The provost does not sign off 
on cases, he doesn’t play a role 
in investigations, doesn’t play 
a role in assigning punishment 
in cases. He, in this case, was 
simply the supervisor of this 
function for the University. 
So, none of the cases that 
have come up during the 
months that the Provost was 
supervising, did he weigh in 
on the details of the case, but 
rather he was the supervisor 
for the office and responsible 
for its management and its 
budget. 
TMD: 
Given 
Provost 
Philbert oversaw OIE and 
was such an important figure 
at the University and now 
has 
accusations 
of 
sexual 
misconduct against him, how 
will the University ensure that 
this does not happen again? 
What steps will you take in 
hiring an interim provost – 
and all future administrators 
– to make sure they have no 
history of sexual misconduct?
MS: This sort of thing 
should never happen. So, if 
the allegations are proven 
true, and regardless, we have 
to think of how we select, 
and then vet our candidates 
for all different jobs at the 
University. … We have to look 
as carefully as we can of the 
people we hire to make sure 
that the likelihood of hiring 
people that have committed 
misconduct in the past or 
may commit it in the future 
is as low as possible. You 
can tell from all the reports 
around 
different 
parts 
of 
society, of episodes of sexual 
misconduct, 
that 
it’s 
not 
infrequent. And you know, 
our 
own 
survey 
data 
on 
campus have told us that it’s 
not infrequent. So, we’ve got 
to figure out how to do this 
better to figure out, how to set 
up a culture where this type of 
misbehavior, this category of 
misbehavior is not tolerated, 
that people feel comfortable 
to report it and to ask for help. 
That peers or other people in 
the environment that have 
suspicions that misconduct is 

occurring, feel comfortable 
and know how to report it. In 
terms of moving forward, the 
University, you know, really 
has to have a provost in place. 
So right now, I’m in the process 
of looking at people who have 
administrative 
experience 
and familiarity, because they 
sort of have to take over all at 
once, although I’ll be working 
with them very closely … And 
we’ll 
get 
talented 
people, 
it’s an important job. We’re 
fortunate at the University to 
have a large number of folks 
with a history of high-level 
service 
and 
demonstrated 
good 
judgment, 
and 
we’ll 
select and get a good person 
to serve.
The 
endowment 
and 
divesting from fossil fuels
TMD: At their last meeting 
in 
December, 
the 
regents 
voted down a $50 million 
investment 
into 
Vendera 
Resources, 
a 
company 
with assets in oil and gas 
production. Does this indicate 
a shift in the University’s 
investment pursuits? 
 MS: I just don’t have more 
to say about that now. I don’t 
have anything to add to the 
observation that you made. 
I’d love to talk about carbon 
neutrality 
efforts 
more 
generally, 
because 
they’re 
extremely important.
TMD: 
Do 
you 
believe 
the 
endowment 
should 
be 
governed 
by 
political 
ideology? 
MS: In general, the purpose 
of the endowment is to provide 
support for an area that we’ve 
agreed with a donor is an area 
that the University thinks 
is important and the donor 
wants to support. We make 
a commitment to the donor 
to be a good steward of their 
money. So that means trying to 
generate the right mix of risk 
and return, you know, that 
sort of yield to the investment 
so that in perpetuity, we 
can support the thing that 
we agreed upon — students’ 
scholarships, 
for 
example 
— and have the endowment 
grow so that its value is not 
eroded with inflation through 
the years. … So, I think that’s 
our 
primary 
responsibility 
… So, I’m giving a general 
answer. I’m not giving it in the 
instance of this issue or that 

issue or even your question of 
politics. I’m saying in general, 
our obligation to donors when 
we accept their money is to do 
this form of stewardship and 
support what we agreed to 
support. 
TMD: The Daily released a 
Statement piece in December 
about 
how 
mass 
student 
protests led up to divestment 
from apartheid South Africa. 
Just these last few days, 
Central Student Government 
passed a resolution with other 
Big Ten schools that demands 
the administrations of all the 
schools freeze all their fossil 
fuel investments. Do you see 
a connection between these 
situations?
MS: 
Well, 
the 
same 
words are used — the word 
divestment is used — so that’s 
an obvious connection. The 
details of the two causes 
that we’re talking about, I 
can’t make a statement, you 
know. 
It’s 
an 
interesting 
question. The fact that both 
CSG and then collectively 
the 
equivalent 
bodies 
all 
across the Big Ten made a 
statement about this, I think 
is important. I think we have 
to hear the student voice 
and respect it and try to 
understand it.
The President’s Commission 
on Carbon Neutrality
TMD: 
We 
reported 
earlier this month on the 
President’s Commission on 
Carbon Neutrality and how, 
in the process of preparing 
recommendations 
for 

achieving carbon neutrality, 
members 
of 
the 
Student 
Advisory Panel felt that the 
perspective of stakeholders 
such 
as 
themselves 
were 
overlooked. 
The 
co-chairs 
of the Commission, Jennifer 
Haverkamp 
and 
Stephen 
Forrest, also stated that they 
haven’t yet met with the other 
three advisory panels. What 
role do student perspectives 
have in the carbon neutrality 
process?
MS: I think we won’t be 
successful unless we have 
student 
perspectives, 
and 
more than just perspectives. 
You know, I think often we 


I

n Rick Santorum, Sean 
Duffy and every other 
commentator 
on 
cable 
news, there is a politician. More 
importantly, there is content. 
The outrage cycle is just a part 
of that content, and as long as 
there is more content, everyone 
is happy. Duffy, formerly of 
“The Real World” fame, was 
elected as part of the 2010 
Tea Party wave to Congress, 
where he remained for almost 
ten years until resigning in 
September of 2019.
After, he opted to head 
where most former politicians 
do — cable news. He made his 
CNN debut in October 2019 by 
smearing an Iraq war veteran 
with a Purple Heart — Lt. 
Col. Alexander Vindman — as 
someone with possible dual 
loyalties toward the Ukraine. 
Duffy’s shameless guesswork 
predictably resulted in outrage, 
and much of it was justified. 
Condemnation reigned down 
from members of the Republican 
leadership like Rep. Liz Cheney, 
R-Wyo., and Sen. John Thune, 
R-S.D., on Duffy’s idea. 
There 
was 
another 
kind 
of 
condemnation 
that 
was 
far more interesting. CNN’s 
Brianna Keilar went out of 
her way to push back on anti-
immigrant bigotry — a good 
thing, no doubt. She was not 
the only CNN anchor to do this; 
others went out of their way to 
prove that Duffy’s ideas were 
reprehensible, and that kind of 
behavior and rhetoric had no 
place in public discourse. 
These 
stances 
may 
have 
had no place in the discourse; 
however, that didn’t stop CNN 
from handing Duffy an obscene 
contract 
worth 
countless 
millions for exactly that rhetoric 
and behavior. Duffy backed the 
Muslim Ban and was hired with 

an entire history of problematic 
actions. And yet, CNN is now 
surprised he is a bigot. Was 
the entire hiring department 
recently hit over the head with 
a two-by-four?
Duffy is a more egregious 
offender than most, but he is by 
no means alone. The entire Lt. 
Col. Alexander Vindman cycle 
with him is almost identical to 
the conflict between former Sen. 
Rick Santorum, R-Pa., and the 
Parkland teenagers in early 2018. 
The Parkland students were 
asking for gun safety laws, and 
Rick Santorum said that students 
from the high school should 
learn CPR instead of marching. 

Of course, there was outrage — 
there were panelists who were 
offended and hosts who took 
shots at Santorum. However, 
Santorum behaving like this 
should 
not 
have 
surprised 
anyone actually paying attention 
to his long career.
Santorum wrote a book in 
2006 that angrily denounced 
what 
he 
saw 
as 
“radical 
feminists” undermining families 
among other claims that would 
make Don Draper blush as far 
as women in the workplace 
are concerned. Again: Here is 
a guy with a history of making 
outlandish comments, and here 
is CNN ready and willing to put 
him back on your TV.

Santorum will continue to 
say idiotic things on TV and 
continue to get rewarded for it 
with bigger contribution deals. 
The cycle then feeds off itself, 
because with more people 
saying bigoted things, there is 
more of a need to send out other 
people and contributors to cut 
down the nonsense. Rather 
than shoveling this garbage 
into the atmosphere and then 
sending out the cleanup crew, 
perhaps CNN could skip the 
first step.
CNN 
is 
not 
the 
only 
offender in this arena. Many 
stations have signed former 
politicians; it’s good to get 
expertise. But that’s not what 
CNN is getting when they 
give a platform to people like 
Duffy and Santorum. Duffy 
was 
never 
a 
particularly 
important member — one of 
his more famous projects was 
a push to end endangered 
protections for grey wolves. 
Furthermore, one can question 
Santorum’s political chops; his 
Senatorial race in 2006 ended 
with the 25th worst defeat by 
an incumbent senator in the 
history of the institution.
The endless outrage cycles 
ought to end. President Donald 
Trump sucks all the oxygen 
out of the room, but still 
leaves space for outrage, and 
the American people deserve 
better than that. TV journalism 
was left a sparkling legacy 
by journalists like Edward 
Murrow and Michigan’s own 
Mike Wallace. Returning to 
their craft and practice will 
take more than firing the 
Duffys and Santorums of the 
world, but it’s a damn good 
start.

Urban development should be inclusive and proactive
T

he 
way 
we 
think 
reflects the way we 
live. 
Some 
people 
live their lives with more 
logical setups, others with 
more free-spirited attitudes, 
but the ability to live with a 
balance of logic and naiveté 
are 
essential 
for 
a 
well-
rounded, stable life.
In the same way, effective 
sustainable 
development 
in urban planning should 
come with both logic and 
abstraction 
in 
its 
design. 
We should logically address 
the 
existing 
technical 
problems while thoughtfully 
anticipating 
the 
possible 
issues in our future society, 
including how we imagine 
our 
future 
infrastructure 
and how we interact with 
infrastructure 
today. 
University 
of 
Michigan 
alum Kristin Baja, with her 
involvement in the Urban 
Sustainability 
Directors 
Network, 
has 
crusaded 
a 
constant focus on using the 
present to address existing 
problems from the past and 
build for the future. Baja, 
among others on the USDN 
staff, has capitalized on the 
idea of resilience to construct 
a type of infrastructure that 
addresses the climate issue 
in a fast-paced and evolving 
world: Resilience Hubs. 
Resilience Hubs are public 
facilities made to support 
communication 
among 
residents of disadvantaged 
communities, 
distribute 
resources 
and 
power 
to 
them 
and 
reduce 
carbon 
emissions to enhance their 
quality of life. Similar to 
standard community centers, 
they are created to develop 
social equity and community 
resilience, 
which 
is 
the 
general term used to refer to 
the measure of a community’s 
resources, 
connections, 
health and mental outlook, as 
well as other factors.
However, these Resilience 
Hubs 
also 
prioritize 
emergency 
management 
and 
climate 
change 
mitigation while providing 
opportunities 
for 
the 
community to become more 
self-sufficient. Though the 
performance of these hubs has 
yet to be evaluated in any case 
studies, they aim to compile 
both tangible and abstract 

components of resilience that 
make for the well-rounded 
function of a community: 
programming, 
structure, 
power, communication and 
operations. As the Director 
of 
Climate 
Resilience 
for 
the USDN, Baja works to 
connect local governments 
and 
community-based 
organizations 
for 
urban 
planning, leading the effort 
to 
make 
these 
Resilience 
Hubs a reality for interested 
communities 
in 
North 
America.
One of the main benefits 
Resilience 
Hubs 
aim 
to 
create 
for 
disadvantaged 
communities is a restoration 
of equity. In response to the 
over-extraction of resources 
and 
racial 
inequity 
that 
causes people of color and 
indigenous 
populations 
to 
face the worst of climate 
change, these hubs are meant 
to solve systemic inequity 
crises 
by 
acknowledging 
and repairing these systems 
on an administrative level. 

In 
supporting 
Resilience 
Hubs, local governments can 
demonstrate 
their 
concern 
for meeting a community’s 
needs and involving it in 
future decision-making. As 
community directors of the 
hubs gain financial support 
and interest from their local 
governments, the hubs can 
become a central mechanism 
by 
which 
authorities 
can 
enhance community cohesion 
and build trust with a fair 
distribution of power.
In other words, the hubs 
make an effort to address 
what 
each 
community 
needs 
while 
maintaining 
their 
infrastructural 
and 
cultural integrity rather than 
implementing a solution that is 
not usable in that community. 
In using this approach, a 
community can receive the 

specific type of help it needs in 
order to flourish. In addition, 
the purpose of the hubs is to 
harbor collaboration among 
multiple 
disciplines 
and 
achieve the goals of more than 
one 
stakeholder 
involved. 
In upholding awareness of 
the needs of communities 
along with the needs of local 
governments, the hubs uphold 
an all-encompassing approach 
to 
solving 
community 
problems in an adaptive and 
proactive way.
Here at the University, 
we have a responsibility to 
pursue efforts that benefit all 
walks of life on our campus. 
Whether we take part in 
leading community reform 
efforts or simply advocate 
for 
them 
indirectly, 
it’s 
important 
that 
everyone 
on 
our 
campus 
upholds 
our reputation of being the 
Leaders and the Best by 
working to implement and 
support fair and restorative 
policies for all groups of 
people. With that said, I 
urge University authorities 
to pursue the purpose of 
Resilience Hubs, if not the 
facilities 
themselves. 
This 
is especially salient as we 
continue 
to 
boast 
about 
the positive impacts of our 
outreach efforts, including 
those 
we 
implement 
in 
Detroit.
In 
terms 
of 
urban 
development, we owe it to the 
future of this campus and the 
future of Ann Arbor to begin 
constructing 
sustainable 
infrastructure 
with 
the 
mentality of appealing to all 
who interact with it. Besides 
the trivial initiatives we have 
executed for our city, we 
should be focusing on how 
we can make it multifaceted 
and adaptable to the evolving 
needs of our population. We 
should ignore the seeming 
importance of focusing on one 
person’s benefit and instead 
be thinking about how we 
can self-determine together 
as a city. We could mold our 
city into one that exemplifies 
our 
lifestyles: 
sustainable, 
inclusive and proactive. In 
doing so, we will create a 
reality that is respectable and 
one that we can relish.

T

he beginning of 2020 
has been defined by 
international 
turmoil, 
ranging from our escalating 
conflict with Iran to sustained 
tensions with North Korea. As 
the United States grapples with 
these issues and many others, 
it is more important than ever 
that there are experienced and 
competent leaders in critical 
diplomatic posts.
During 
his 
presidential 
campaign, 
Donald 
Trump 
promised to “drain the swamp” 
and rid Washington of career 
politicians. Consequently, once 
elected, Trump failed to fill many 
important diplomatic positions 
or nominated people who lack 
critical international relations 
experience. One of the clearest 
examples of an underqualified 
diplomat is Kelly Craft, the 
current U.S. Ambassador to the 
United Nations. Craft’s husband 
is a coal baron who donated 
heavily 
to 
GOP 
candidates, 
including over $2 million to 
Trump’s campaign. After his 
election, 
Trump 
nominated 
Craft to be the U.S. Ambassador 
to Canada. She served in this 
role for 20 months, but came 
under fire for not being present 
in Canada for nearly half her 
time as Ambassador.
The role of a U.S. Ambassador 
to the U.N. is one of great 
importance as the ambassador 
represents America on a world 
stage and helps facilitate the 
resolution of important global 
issues 
through 
diplomacy. 
Whether it is imposing sanctions 
on North Korea, advocating for 
an arms embargo to prevent 
weapons being sent to a war-torn 
region or helping to organize 
the international response to 
the Ebola crisis, this is a vitally 
important position. 
Craft 
is 
particularly 
concerning due to her ties to 
the fossil fuel industry. She has 

made 
concerning 
comments 
in the past about how she sees 
“both sides” in the climate 
change debate — remarks which 
she was later forced to retract. 
Although she agreed to recuse 
herself on any coal-related U.N. 
discussions due to her husband’s 
business, there is still concern 
about how her ties to the fossil 
fuel industry will impact her 
work. 
The U.N. is on the front lines of 
the fight against climate change, 
from hosting Greta Thunberg at 
the 2019 Climate Action Summit 
to commissioning reports that 
emphasize the true magnitude 
of the issue. Given Craft’s ties to 
the coal industry, it is concerning 
that she will be in this position. 
Despite these issues, Craft was 
confirmed as U.N. ambassador 
by the Senate with almost no 
Democratic support. 
We have seen similar stories 
of inexperienced officials being 
awarded 
important 
roles 
in 
government, 
including 
Rex 
Tillerson — former Exxon Mobil 
CEO — who served as Trump’s 
first Secretary of State, despite 
having no formal diplomatic 
experience 
or 
background. 
Trump has shown a propensity 
for 
nominating 
donors 
to 
ambassadorships, 
despite 
their inherent lack of relevant 
experience for the role. Such was 
the case with the Ambassador to 
the United Arab Emirates, where 
Trump broke the longstanding 
precedent 
of 
appointing 
a 
career diplomat to the role and 
instead chose John Rakolta Jr., a 
businessman with no diplomatic 
background.
One may argue Trump is 
simply following a precedent 
set by past U.S. presidents on 
both sides of the aisle, who 
also 
awarded 
donors 
with 
ambassadorships. 
However, 
an 
analysis 
of 
Trump’s 
picks has shown that he has 

nominated 
underqualified 
donors to ambassadorships at 
a higher rate than any of his 
predecessors. In an equally 
dangerous 
fashion, 
many 
important 
positions 
related 
to international relations or 
national security remain vacant. 
There are hundreds of open 
positions in the administration, 
with at least 88 of them in 
the Department of Defense. 
Important 
roles 
such 
as 
Secretary of the Navy, Director 
of National Intelligence and 
Secretary of Homeland Security 
are all vacant or are filled by 
acting personnel who have 
not had to face questioning or 
a Senate confirmation vote. 
This is extremely concerning 
because, without the proper 
staffing, 
these 
departments 
and agencies may be stretched 
too thin or may be unable 
to meet the needs of our 
rapidly changing geopolitical 
situation. Given our current 
international uncertainty, it is 
more important than ever that 
these critical positions are filled 
by competent and experienced 
officials. 
As we have seen with the 
recent 
situation 
with 
Iran, 
students 
are 
taking 
notice 
of the volatile state of our 
international 
affairs. 
From 
protests to memes, University 
of 
Michigan 
students 
have 
expressed concern over the 
condition of our world and our 
relationship with other nations. 
If we want to maintain a safe 
and secure world, we need to 
be aware of the incompetent but 
powerful figures guiding our 
foreign policy and use our voices 
to advocate for stronger and 
more capable leaders to resolve 
the issues facing our nation and 
our world in the future.

Unchained to 
curating a group 
of songs into an 
album, Shelton 
can release 
whatever he 
wants, whenever 
he wants.

For better or for worse, it 
seems like we won’t be getting 
any new Blake Shelton albums 
for a long time … or maybe 
ever. Whether that possibility 
bums you out or makes you sigh 
in relief — keep in mind that 
Shelton isn’t going anywhere.
In 
an 
interview 
with 
Entertainment 
Tonight, 
Shelton 
admitted, 
“I 
don’t 
want to put out another album, 
I really don’t.” Instead, he 
hinted that his plan is to keep 
releasing music as it comes 
to him, to just put out single 
after single. “Do people care 
about 
[albums] 
anymore?” 
Shelton asked himself during 
his decision-making process. “I 
don’t know,” he concluded. But 
in an industry where streaming 
reigns supreme and singles 
drop like wildfire, Shelton can’t 
be alone in having doubts.
At the same time Shelton was 
swearing off releasing albums, 
his single “God’s Country” was 
climbing to its eventual spot 
atop Billboard’s Hot Country 
Songs 
chart. 
Dark, 
moody 
and more southern rock than 
country pop, “God’s Country” 
was a departure for Shelton. 
Then came “Hell Right,” a 
nauseating return to his usual, 
featuring 
Trace 
Adkins. 
As 
of Jan. 21, his latest single is 

“Nobody But You,” a pleasant yet 
forgettable duet with Shelton’s 
girlfriend Gwen Stefani.
One read on Shelton’s latest 
offerings is freedom. Another 
is chaos. Unchained to curating 
a group of songs into an album, 
Shelton can release whatever he 
wants, whenever he wants. As a 
listener, I was refreshed to hear 
“God’s Country.” I thought that 
I was being introduced to a new 

side of Shelton — the serious 
side. But I was misled. His 
next two singles sound nothing 
like “God’s Country” and the 

promising direction suggested 
by that song became a missed 
opportunity.
This is precisely what Shelton 
is losing out on by forgoing 
albums — the chance to dive into 
a new sound, to be pulled in an 
artistic direction and stick with 
it long enough to explore where 
it could lead him. Making an 
album has the ability to improve 
the overall quality of the singles. 
More importantly, this prevents 
listeners from getting whiplash 
every time they hear new music 
from an artist. Albums are meant 
to anchor. They contextualize, 
constructing a world the singles 
can thrive in. In order to really 
sink your teeth into a new sound 
or idea or artist, you need more 
than three minutes with them.
Blake 
Shelton’s 
unique 
position within country music, 
and the greater music industry 
itself, 
cannot 
be 
ignored 
when analyzing his business 
strategies. Shelton holds the 
record for the most consecutive 
number ones on the country 
airplay chart. He’s a beloved 
personality inside and outside of 
the genre with gigs like hosting 
the American Country Music 
Awards and judging The Voice. 
Shelton 
could 
release 
static 
to country radio, and it would 
get airtime. Maybe that’s why 
Shelton is actually the perfect 
candidate to experiment with 
how he releases music — he 
doesn’t need an album to glue 
his songs together, his brand is 

enough.
Shelton isn’t the only country 
artist to have challenged the 
value of albums. In 2017, up-and-
comer Hunter Hayes decided 
that he would simply release 
songs when he felt their stories 
needed to be heard, without any 
kind of album agenda. “It’s gonna 
be a little bit of everything,” he 
announced at the CMT Music 
Awards that year, “the big singles 
and the songs that just matter 
to me.” But none of the songs 
he ended up releasing, single or 
not, ended up catching speed. 
Eventually, Hayes relented. In 
October of 2019 he released his 
first album in five years, Wild 
Blue, and found himself further 
back in his country music career 
than where he left off with his 
sophomore record. 
Pop artists have tried the 
same 
technique 
with 
great 
success. Selena Gomez released 
a string of hit singles in 2017 

with “It Ain’t Me,” “Bad Liar,” 
“Fetish” and “Wolves” before 
eventually placing them on the 
Target edition of her album 
Rare two years later. Gomez’s 
success points to the artist being 
the key to pursuing the “single 
strategy.” Additionally, because 
of country radio’s dominance in 
determining what gets heard by 
which country artists, country 
music may be an even more 
conducive format to releasing 
album-less singles than pop — if 
you’re the right artist.
At the end of the day, I 
will always root for albums. 
Listening to a carefully crafted 
collection of songs from top to 
bottom is an experience; one 
that isn’t worth sacrificing for 
an already popular artist to 
boost their streams. Many of 
my favorite songs are album 
cuts — experimental tracks that 
wouldn’t quite make it on radio 
but still deserve to be heard. 

Albums set the tone for artists’ 
subsequent tours and live shows. 
I think the best concerts create 
an atmosphere where an artist’s 
latest album and biggest hits can 
exist together. Playing a set of 
detached singles doesn’t have 
the same affect. 
While 
researching 
this 
article, I came across the names 
of a few of Shelton’s latest tours. 
There’s the incredibly creative 
“Blake 
Shelton 
2016 
Tour,” 
the cringeworthy “Doing It to 
Country Songs Tour” and the 
downright odd “Country Music 
Freaks Tour.” And then it hit me. 
Just releasing singles is perfect 
for an artist like Shelton. He 
isn’t interested in making any 
grand artistic statements, he’s 
interested in singing the songs 
he likes, entertaining crowds 
and making money. And maybe 
that’s OK. Maybe there’s room 
for all kinds of artists and 
release strategies in music.

done releasing full albums

A white girl is murdered 
in a small town in the South. 
The police have no leads and 
are under pressure to arrest a 
suspect. Who easier to convict 
than a Black man from a poor 
neighborhood?
“Just 
Mercy” 
follows 
the 
true story of Walter “Johnny 
D.” McMillian (Jamie Foxx, 
“Robin Hood”), a Black man 
who 
is 
sentenced 
to 
death 
for a crime he couldn’t have 
possibly committed, and Bryan 
Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan, 
“Black Panther”), the young 
upstart lawyer who fights for 
his freedom. Stevenson and his 
newly-formed law firm face fierce 
opposition from the district 
attorney, the county sheriff and 
the deeply entrenched racism 
of a small southern community. 
Set in Monroeville, Alabama in 
the late ’80s and early ’90s, the 
film is an exhibition of police 
corruption, judicial malpractice 
and a shattered system of justice.
From the very beginning, 
Stevenson sees the glaring holes 
in the case against McMillian, 
just from reading the court 
documents. 
When 
Stevenson 
goes 
to 
county 
prosecutor 
Tommy Chapman (Rafe Spall, 
“Men In Black: International”), 
he 
warns 
against 
opening 
old 
wounds. 
According 
to 
him, nobody in town believes 
McMillian is innocent. But when 
Stevenson goes to McMillian’s 

family, he is welcomed by a crowd 
of community members who 
know 
McMillian’s 
innocence 
for a fact. There’s overwhelming 
evidence to clear McMillian’s 
name, and when word spreads 
that Stevenson is digging up 
that evidence, the intimidation 
begins: 
the 
unlawful 
arrest 
of 
a 
witness 
testifying 
to 
McMillian’s innocence, a bomb 
threat 
against 
Stevenson’s 

partner Eva Ansley (Brie Larson, 
“Avengers: Endgame”), police 
officers who hold Stevenson 
at gunpoint at a traffic stop. 
However, Stevenson’s resolve is 
unshakeable and he refuses to 
walk away from the case.
While the movie principally 
follows 
the 
case 
of 
Walter 
McMillian, it also covers a 
concurrent case handled by 
Stevenson, the story of death 
row inmate Herbert “Herb” 
Richardson 
(Rob 
Morgan, 
“The Last Black Man In San 
Francisco”). Richardson’s case 
is different from McMillian’s. 
Richardson did in fact commit 
the crime he was charged with: 
planting a bomb that killed a 

young girl. Yet he was jailed 
with no acknowledgment of his 
service in Vietnam or his obvious 
and untreated PTSD.
“Just 
Mercy” 
would 
be 
incomplete without Richardson’s 
inclusion. It’s one thing to show 
how the death penalty has been 
doled out wrongly on a racial 
pretext. It’s another to expose 
just how wrong the death penalty 
is, even when the charges are 
accurate. Morgan’s performance 
as the haunted, death-destined 
inmate compels compassion in 
the audience. He encapsulates 
the hopelessness of death row in 
a brutally frank comparison to 
being in war: “It’s different than 
‘Nam. At least I had a chance 
there.”
Given the dramatized nature 
of the story, it’s easy to suspect 
there are many artistic liberties 
at play. But “Just Mercy” sticks 
to the facts with surprising 
accuracy. A fact vs. fiction piece 
by Slate highlights this, noting 
most changes to Stevenson’s 
story are “matters of dramatic 
compression.” That being said, 
the movie is not 100% accurate. 
If 
anything, 
it 
underplays 
much of the stark racism; what 
real-life Sheriff Tate (Michael 
Harding, “Halt and Catch Fire”) 
said upon arresting McMillian 
is far more egregious than his 
film 
counterpart. 
Ironically, 
“Just Mercy” is merciful in 
its depiction of its most guilty 
characters.

‘Mercy’ portrays racism of

The 
atmosphere 
before 
Saturday 
night’s 
Minnesota 
Orchestra 
concert 
at 
Hill 
Auditorium was electric. The 
orchestra was dressed in white-
tie attire, the choir in black ties. 
This was the University Musical 
Society’s first performance of 
the decade in Hill Auditorium. 
It was an all-Sibelius concert 
conducted 
by 
Finnish 
conductor (and noted Sibelius 
enthusiast) Osmo Vänskä. The 
stage was artificially extended 
to fit the large orchestra, as 
well as the choir and narrator 
required for the opening work: 
composer 
Jean 
Sibelius’s 
“Snöfrid,” a choral melodrama 
rarely performed in the United 
States.
In 
a 
pre-concert 
talk, 
the audience got a sense for 
the 
musical 
and 
linguistic 
challenges that went behind 
programming 
this 
rarely-
performed 
work. 
Not 
only 
were the choral and narratorial 
parts 
in 
Swedish, 
they 
were in Old Swedish. The 
UMS Choral Union, a UMS 
employee 
explained, 
spent 
months learning to sing in 
this language. Along with the 
narrator, Sassa Åkervall, they 
were more than up to the task.
Though the work dragged at 
a few points, particularly when 
the audience’s attention was 
split between the supertitles 
projected above the ensemble 
and 
the 
narrator 
speaking 
over 
simple 
orchestral 
textures, the overall effect 
was 
quite 
convincing. 
For 
those 
American 
audiences 
that know little of Sibelius’s 
work besides his symphonies 
and violin concerto, this was 
a reminder of Sibelius’s tone 
poems, melodramas and other 
programmatic pieces.
After a brief pause, the 
orchestra launched into my 
favorite performance of the 
evening, Sibelius’s “Concerto 
in d minor for Violin and 
Orchestra.” The soloist was 
US-born Finnish violinist Elina 
Vähälä. 
Coming from the triumphant 
ending of the first work, it 
took a few seconds to adjust 
to the orchestra’s new sound. 

Sibelius’s 
concerto 
starts 
almost as quiet as possible 
— in the transition between 
“Snöfrid” 
and 
the 
Violin 
Concerto, the full dynamic 
range of the ensemble was on 
display.
From her first entrance, 
Vähälä’s 
sound 
was 
as 
commanding as her presence 
was unassuming. Unlike many 
concerto soloists, she didn’t use 
physical gestures to emphasize 
her performance abilities. She 
made her part look easy, almost 
effortless at times.
At one point, for example, the 
violinist is called upon to play 
four notes at once; by quickly 
curling the bow along the four 
strings, they can approximate 
these 
four-note 
harmonies. 
Vähälä navigated this passage 

with ease, even managing to 
compliment the inner-harmony 
melodies she was playing that 
were also sounding in the upper 
woodwinds.
The orchestra, particularly 
the upper strings, seemed to 
build off of Vähälä’s energy. 
A 
performance 
that 
began 
tentative and fragile ended 
bright and triumphant. The 
Minnesota Orchestra clearly 
knows its Sibelius, from the 
sweeping melodic lines double 
by the strings to the occasional 
brass melodies and woodwind 
solos that briefly come to the 
fore.
After 
Vähälä’s 
stellar 
performance and the audience’s 
two 
rounds 
of 
applause, 
the orchestra began one of 
Sibelius’s 
most 
performed 
works: the “Symphony No. 5 
in E-flat Major.” Yet again, the 

opening minutes felt tentative 
and 
rushed. 
Some 
of 
the 
accelerandos and ritardandos 
(increases 
and 
decreases 
in 
tempo) 
were 
slightly 
exaggerated.
Once 
the 
orchestra 
hit 
their 
stride, 
though, 
they 
never 
lost 
it. 
The 
ending 
of the first movement was 
executed perfectly. It was the 
quintessential Sibelius ending: 
loud, proud melodic lines over 
simple pedal harmonies. 
The 
second 
and 
third 
movements 
unfolded 
in 
a 
similar manner to the first. 
I was surprised, at first, at 
how little the volume and 
expressive contour of these two 
movements changed. But this 
was not a quiet, unassuming 
concert opener. This was the 
confident end to the concert 
and the orchestra interpreted 
the work at such.
And in the middle of the third 
movement, when the orchestra 
finally played the sweeping, 
soaring theme the symphony is 
famous for, I couldn’t help but 
close my eyes to revel in the 
sound. If this had been all that 
the orchestra performed, it still 
would have made the evening 
worth it.
After two rounds of applause, 
the 
orchestra 
performed 
a 
brief encore: Sibelius’s “Valse 
Triste.” This quirky little waltz 
was an appropriate end to an 
evening of Sibelius. We’d heard 
his dramatic choral music, his 
virtuosic instrumental music, 
his 
magnificent 
symphonic 
music 
and 
now 
his 
fun 
character pieces. 
This 
all-Sibelius 
concert 
drew 
my 
attention 
to 
a 
number of these archetypical 
Sibelius techniques. Frequent 
fluctuations 
between 
arco 
and pizzicato string sections, 
for one thing, as a means of 
repeating melodic lines but 
varying 
color 
and 
texture. 
Sparing 
use 
of 
brass 
and 
woodwinds 
was 
another. 
Above all, it was Sibelius’s 
simple, diatonic melodies, the 
kind that are doubled by three 
string 
sections 
(sometimes 
even at the octave) that most 
stuck out to me. I left with a 
newfound interest in Sibelius 
— a composer that I thought I 
knew very well — which is quite 
a statement about the quality of 
the performance I’d witnessed.

For all its subplots, the enduring 
struggle of Netflix’s “The Ranch” 
has always been the Bennetts 
themselves. 
The 
tumultuous 
relationship 
between 
Colt’s 
(Ashton Kutcher, “That 70s Show”) 
narcissism and the intensity of 
his father, Beau (Sam Elliot, “The 
Mule”), has been at the center of 
it all. As the Bennetts continue to 
suffer from fighting one another, so 
does their beloved ranch. Nothing 
grows where there is no nurturing. 
Thus, the fourth season of this often 
dark western comedy has arrived 
and with it, the end of “The Ranch.”
The second half of the season 
comes after the first half was left on 
a cliffhanger: Who shot Nick (Josh 
Burrow, “The Crimson Mask”)? 
While both Colt and his cousin 
Luke (Dax Shepard, “Bless This 
Mess”) are arrested, it was actually 
Colt’s ex-girlfriend Heather (Kelli 
Goss, “Grey’s Anatomy”) behind the 
trigger. 
Season four allows the Bennets 
to leave on a high note, after three 
seasons of misfortunes. Colt and 
Abby (Elisha Cuthbert, “24”) come 
to the decision that they’d like to 
have a second child. Luke comes 
to terms with the death of a close 
friend and to the conclusion about 

where he wants to be — at the ranch 
with the Bennetts. At the same 
time, Colt manages to do some 
sleuthing — proving the foul play 
of a large agricultural corporation. 
In the process, Colt not only saves 
his father’s ranch, but also acquires 
a new ranch next door for his new 
family.
Despite its large and talented 
cast, 
“The 
Ranch” 
has 
gone 
relatively overlooked for each of 

its four seasons. Yet, the show 
has been notable for a number of 
reasons, including the crassness 
with which the characters speak. 
The series never shied away from 
f-bombs, nor introspection. Even 
more notable is its subject matter. 
“The Ranch” has maintained an 

idle, almost offhand preoccupation 
with the rural. Here the Bennetts 
were, in the same town they grew 
up in, in the same bar they’ve 
always been drinking in, doing the 
same things they’ve always done. 
Perhaps it’s because of this that the 
Bennetts have struggled to survive 
in the onslaught of change and 
misfortune. Beau’s insistence on not 
moving his herd during a wildfire, 
only to lose track of his family, is one 
such notable example.
But I think “The Ranch” is more 
than that. There are few televised 
offerings that portray country living 
in a way that doesn’t pander or talk 
down to people with rural lifestyles. 
Yet, “The Ranch” has always been 
firm in portraying ruralites with 
a heavy dash of humility. Yes, Colt 
and Rooster are ranchers whose 
names are literal farm animals, 
and yes, they do get up to some 
yee-haw shenanigans. But the 
show also punishes its characters 
for this. The narrative punishes 
characters for being set in their 
ways too deeply. “The Ranch” does 
not praise the mischief that arises 
from the itchiness that comes with 
living in the middle of nowhere. But 
it also doesn’t condemn it, because 
that’s unreasonable and a tad 
discriminatory.

Here’s to roots, to ‘Ranch’

NETFLIX

Oh, Mipso, you have my 
heart. 
Mipso, 
a 
folk/bluegrass 
quartet hailing from Chapel 
Hill, returned to Ann Arbor 
this past Friday to perform at 
the Ark and fit into this city 
like a vintage, leather glove. 
The evening began as quietly 
and strangely as it ended, with 
the astral music of openers 
Bridget Kearney on electric 
bass/vocals 
and 
Benjamin 
Lazar Davis on a whole slew 
of instruments. Their music 
snuck up on me. These two 
quiet, endearingly awkward 
musicians 
created 
these 
incredibly stark soundscapes 
dotted with musical oddities 
and rhythmic complications. 
Kearney’s 
deceptively 
simple lyrics combined with 
Davis’ 
eccentric 
musical 
flare made for a continually 
surprising experience. It felt 
simultaneously 
welcoming 
and isolating, like they were 
inviting you to feel lonely 
with them. Each song had 
an 
uncomfortable 
element 
to it, but uncomfortable in 
that it made you alert, not in 
a way that was unpleasant to 
listen to. These oddball songs, 
coupled with the performers’ 
awkwardly wonderful sense 
of humor, made the audience 
ready to receive anything. 
When Mipso entered, they 
slid right into their set as if they 
had always been there, playing 
as smooth and consistent as 
river water. They didn’t stop 
to acknowledge the audience 
until after their third song, and 
the greeting seemed less like 
an introduction and more like a 
continuation of a relationship. 
Their set glittered with gems 
from their new album, EDGES 
RUN, as well as a few sneak 
peaks from their upcoming 

album (title TBD) and some 
hilariously-picked 
and 
brilliantly-executed 
covers. 
The audience chuckled and 
cackled in disbelief when the 
shimmering opening chords of 
a new song quickly turned into 
a Death Cab for Cutie song.
Each 
member 
shone 
brilliantly: 
Jacob 
Sharp’s 
(mandolin, 
vocals) 
lyrical 
depth 
and 
quiet, 
yearning 
vocals were heart-wrenching; 
Wood Robinson (bass, vocals) 
rooted the band with his steady 
playing; Joseph Terrell (guitar, 
vocals) gave the band its fun, 

classically-country flair; and 
Libby 
Rodenbough 
(fiddle, 
vocals) tied it all together 
with a fiddle that soared and 
danced, a voice that slipped 
through tight harmonies and 
sweet lyrics, and an attitude 
that commanded and drove the 
band forward.
Though 
each 
was 
remarkable, the most beautiful 
aspect of their performance 
— in addition to their quirky 
quips between songs and their 
friendly, intimate banter with 
each other and the audience 
— was how much they shared 
the spotlight. The songs in 
the set felt varied tonally in 
a complementary, refreshing 
way, and the lead singer was 
constantly rotating between 

the band members.
In fact, I don’t even know if I 
can say there is a lead singer in 
the band. Mipso accomplishes 
something rare that I didn’t 
realize the full extent of until 
seeing them live: they all work. 
Each one of them played at 
least two different instruments 
in the concert alone, all of them 
sang beautifully, and from the 
lyrical variance, it became clear 
that each of them contributed 
to the writing. Each band 
member 
is 
a 
musician, 
a 
singer, a lyricist and a vivid, 
welcoming presence onstage, 
making each of them essential 
and irreplaceable. And that is, 
for a lack of better words, truly 
insane. 
It 
is 
rare 
to 
see 
tight 
collaboration anywhere, but 
what a delight it is to witness 
such collaboration in action.

The 
multi-talented, 

symbiotic relationship between 
all of the group members 
coalesced 
into 
a 
vibrant, 
energetic 
folk 
experience. 
Each song charged forward, 
while retaining that sense of 
laid-back ease inherent in folk 
music. They met each moment 
with 
enthusiasm 
and 
then 
relaxed into it. And, in turn, we 
relaxed with them.
When they came back out for 
their encore, the band met the 
audience with an incredibly 
somber song about being ready 
to die. This made a few audience 
members who recognized the 
tune greet the encore with 
scattered chuckles, but we all 
quickly gave into the soothing 
flow of the song. 
They slipped out of the 
concert and this town as 
smoothly and naturally as they 
had entered it, leaving the 
audience with sweet memories 
of well-crafted songs and a 
subtle itching in the back of our 
minds — a sense of waiting and 
eagerness for whatever is to 
come from the haunting, lively 
band Mipso.

Johnson, Hillmon adding leadership

On 
Sunday, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
desperately needed a win against 
Rutgers to get its season back on 
track. Putting up a career-high 
24 points and 11 rebounds, senior 
guard Akienreh Johnson stepped 
up with her first career double-
double to help the Wolverines 
win, 71-57. Her performance was 
even more crucial with senior 
forward Kayla Robbins out with 
a torn ACL.
But equally important to her 
performance on the court has 
been her emergence as a leader. 
It’s something she’s had to do all 
season, but now that Robbins is 
out, she’s the only healthy senior 
on the team — thrust into a much 
higher-pressure situation. 
She answered the call. 
“That’s the first thing I thought 
about (after Robbins’ injury) 
when we got back to Ann Arbor, 
is like, ‘How am I going to lead 
this team without my partner in 
crime?’ ” Johnson said last week. 
“We’re still roommates, we’re 
still going to do that, but it’s just 
going to be difficult without an 

experienced person and that’s 
part of the worker she is. She’s 
just not going to be on the court. 
So my leadership role is definitely 
going to have to change.”
That change was clear Sunday. 
With three freshmen — guards 
Maddie 
Nolan 
and 
Michelle 
Sidor, and center Izabel Varejão 
— all seeing meaningful minutes, 
Johnson was much more vocal 
on the court than she has been 
in the past. When her teammates 
made shots, she was the first to 
congratulate them. When they 
missed shots, she was there to 
pick them up. 
But even more telling of her 
leadership 
capabilities, 
she 
publicly called on them to step up. 
“(My role) is going to have 
to change, but also everybody 
else,” Johnson said. “(Sophomore 
forward Naz Hillmon) is going to 
have to step up, be a more vocal 
leader. Amy (Dilk) is going to 
have to step up. I think Danielle 
(Rauch) did a great job during 
that game of being a vocal leader 
… I’m only one person, and it’s 
just not going to get done with 
just one person being a leader on 
the court.”
Hillmon will be looking to 

answer that call. Though she’s 
only a sophomore, her role as the 
team’s leading scorer means that 
she’ll need to mature as a player 
more quickly than her teammates. 
On Sunday, she led by example. 
Beyond her usual scoring — she 
scored 20 points, 3.9 more than 
her season average — she added 
12 rebounds. On defense, she 
anchored a 2-3 zone that helped 
force the Scarlet Knights into 17 
turnovers.
“I think that I’m still coming 
into that role, just trying to make 
sure I’m focusing on myself, make 
sure I’m focused in,” Hillmon 
said. “Because I can’t really tell 
other people to do stuff that I’m 
not already locked in on. … Trying 
to talk as much as I can, especially 
when we’re in zone. I mean the 
top of the zone doesn’t know 
what’s going on half the time and 
just trying to be in those huddles, 
being a positive energy.”
It’ll be a process for both 
Johnson and Hillmon to adapt to 
their new roles. Both of them have 
stressed that they’re going to lead 
their own way — they won’t try to 
be Kayla Robbins. 
Against Rutgers, they showed 
that they don’t have to be.

Michigan sweeps ITA kickoff, 2-0

Andrea Cerdan was ready to 
deliver the dagger.
The freshman had taken the 
upper 
hand 
against 
Valeriya 
Zeleva, forcing her into the alley 
to respond to an aggressive series 
of groundstrokes. All Zeleva could 
manage was a desperation heave, 
sending the ball in a slow, looping 
trajectory over the net, while 
Cerdan positioned herself for a 
volley to put the point out of reach.
She fired it into the net.
The dagger would have to wait.
The No. 15 Michigan women’s 
tennis team (2-0) played host 
to 
the 
International 
Tennis 
Association 
kick-off 
meet 
at 
the Varsity Tennis Center this 
weekend, and after a 4-2 semifinal 
win over Mississippi (3-1) and a 
4-2 defeat of No. 12 Central Florida 
(2-1), the Wolverines clinched a 
berth to the ITA National Team 
indoor championship. It did not go 
without a hitch.
“We’re going to have a lot of 
opportunities there to play the top 
teams in the country,” Michigan 
coach Ronni Bernstein said. “That 
was our goal, so (we’re) happy to 
get through this weekend.”
Against 
the 
Rebels, 
the 
Wolverines jumped out to an early 
lead thanks to their sweep of the 
doubles matches; in the singles, 
the only major casualty was No. 1 
singles player and No. 26 overall, 
senior Guilia Pairone, who fell in 
straight sets. 
“For our first match, to play 
a quality team like that and get 
through … that was a big team 
win,” Bernstein said.
On Sunday, Michigan found 
itself on the other side of a 
doubles sweep. Two of Central 
Florida’s pairs ranked inside the 
top 15 nationally, compared to 
three unranked Wolverine duos. 
Michigan kept all three matches 
close with competence on the 
baseline, but Central Florida used 
its subtlety at the net to create 
winners and end rallies in its favor; 
the same could not be said for the 
Wolverines.

“We’re staying back more, and 
they’re hitting it big,” Bernstein 
said, “so it’s hard to come in unless 
it’s the right ball, so maybe they 
just weren’t picking the right ball.”
Six points were still available 
at the start of singles play, and 
both squads claimed one after 
early 
straight-set 
victories. 
Meanwhile, 
Pairone 
and 
the 
Knights’ 
Evgeniya 
Levashova 
took their time, exchanging long 
rallies and dueling deep into each 
game. Levashova grabbed a slight 
advantage when she went up a 
break, riding it to a first set victory. 
On the other side of the 
complex, 
Cerdan 
dropped 
a 
tightly-contested first set, 7-5.
“The first set, I was going a little 
bit too much, being a little overly 
aggressive.” Cerdan said. “I was 
too focused on holding back or 
being too aggressive; I couldn’t 
find the in-between. That also led 
to me getting frustrated.”
Cerdan found the balance deep 
in the second set. Moments after 
the unforced error on the volley, 
she faced a similar opportunity 
on a set point. Zeleva surrendered 
another lob, but before she could 
get back to the middle, Cerdan 
used an overhead smash — over 
the net this time — to even the 
match. She took the third set, 6-1, 
delivering the final blow.
While Pairone won her second 
set by that same score, senior 
Chiara Lommer was frustrated on 
the adjacent court. 
She had made quick work of 
Nadja Bay Christians in the first 

set, 6-2, and built a 5-1 lead in the 
second, but began to hemorrhage 
points. As the match wore on, 
she leaned on her forehand more 
and more, taking inside-out shots 
instead of the more efficient 
backhand 
from 
the 
baseline 
corner. 
Her 
groundstrokes 
barraged the net, leaving ample 
“what-ifs.”
“I haven’t been feeling great on 
the court, so a little bit of belief in 
closing out the second set was just 
missing,” Lommer said. “And she 
also, obviously, didn’t miss a ball 
anymore.”
Bernstein 
stopped 
pacing 
around the remaining matches 
and sat by Lommer’s court.
“I knew that I didn’t want her to 
slip,” Bernstein said. “She had a big 
lead, you want them to get off the 
court there, get that third point.”
Lommer managed to win the 
first-to-seven tiebreaker, taking 
the set, match and even more 
crucially, the fourth and final point 
needed for Michigan’s team win. 
“That’s a great win for her,” 
Bernstein said. “For her to come 
back in that pressure moment, to 
come through, I think it’s going 
to give her a lot of confidence. I’m 
really proud of how she fought and 
stuck with it.”
Lommer fell to her knees as Bay 
Christians’ final ball soared out 
of bounds. The first to join her in 
celebration was Pairone, whose 
match was abandoned in the midst 
of a neck-and-neck third set. 
Cerdan wasn’t far behind. She 
had delivered the dagger after all.

It’s a moment Michigan coach 
Sean Bormet always talks about: 
being the guy to decide the 
match. The one with the weight 
of the team on your shoulders. 
It’s usually the heavyweights. 
The 125-pound duals get the 
match started off on the right 
foot, then sit back and watch 
their teammates try and pull out 
a victory. 
But Friday night, on the road 
against No. 15 Northwestern (3-4 
overall, 1-3 Big Ten), 125-pound 
redshirt sophomore Jack Medley 
found himself competing in the 
final bout of the night with the 
score tied at 17. 
“I think Jack enjoyed the 
moment 
and 
enjoyed 
the 
opportunity,” Bormet said. “... 
I turned around on the bench 
to check with each guy before 
they step on the mat. I could 
see he was excited and eager for 
the moment to be the last guy to 
wrestle and decide the team dual 
victory.”
The Wildcats won the coin 
toss and strategically started 
the dual with the 133-pound 
bout in hopes that the fate of 
the dual would come down to 
the 125-bout. Their wish was 
granted, but it was Medley and 
the No. 25 Michigan wrestling 
team (5-3, 4-1) that pulled off the 
upset road victory, 20-17, over 
Northwestern. 
Medley faced sixth-ranked 
Michael DeAugustino with the 
dual on the line. The score was 
tied after the first period, with 
neither wrestler finding the 
opportunity for a takedown. 
DeAugustino scored an escape 
point to take the lead in the 
second 
period, 
but 
Medley 
quickly evened the score with 
an escape of his own to start the 
third, and final, period. 
With 1:24 left in the third 
period, 
Medley 
scored 
a 
takedown, putting him up, 3-1, 
which would ultimately be the 
deciding factor in the match and 

meet. With under one minute 
left, 
DeAugustino 
needed 
a 
takedown for the comeback 
victory. 
“The last 15 seconds I told 
myself, ‘Stay smart don’t back up 
and get a stalling call’ cause I had 
a stalling call against me, so that 
would have given him a point,” 
Medley said. 
Though he scored an escape 
point, 
Medley 
miraculously 
avoided a takedown with just 
nine seconds left to clinch the 
bout. Medley won, 3-2, securing 
an upset victory for himself and 
a 20-17 win for his team. 
“He’s a guy that’s a tireless 
worker and we as a staff and as a 
team have a ton of confidence in 
Jack,” Bormet said.
Competing in an unusual spot 
in the lineup and wrestling a 
highly-ranked opponent did not 
faze Medley and was a challenge 
he fully embraced. 
“They definitely had a strategy 
of having our match as the last 
match to give their other guy 
some 
more 
recovery 
time,” 
Medley said. “But it didn’t 
matter.” 
The Wolverines began the 
match strong, winning the first 
three bouts in dominant fashion 
to give Michigan a 12-0 lead. 133-
pound fifth-year senior Austin 
Assad set the tone from the onset 
with a 10-0 major decision. 
However, 
inconsistency 
in the middleweights, which 
has plagued the Wolverines 
throughout the season, caused 
the outcome of the dual to be in 
doubt. After a hot start, Michigan 
lost five straight bouts in the 
157, 165, 174, 184 and 197 weight 
classes. 
“I think we need to be 
consistent in how we think and 
in how we wrestle,” Bormet said. 
“There were a couple of matches 
that we lost our composure and 
we didn’t refocus the way we 
needed to.”
The 
Wildcats 
turned 
a 
12-point deficit into a 14-12 lead 
after 
11th-ranked, 
184-pound 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Jelani 
Embree fell to Northwestern’s 

Jack Jessen. Embree took a 2-1 
lead after the first period, but was 
taken down in the second period 
and never recovered. Jessen 
won the decision, 7-6, and, more 
importantly, stole the lead and 
momentum from the Wolverines. 
“I think (Embree) was really 
capable of scoring with his speed 
and some leg attacks,” Bormet 
said. “He kinda got caught up 
wrestling 
some 
upper 
body 
positions that he is pretty good 
it but its just positions that he 
didn’t need to wrestle in.”
Sophomore 
and 
No. 
2 
heavyweight 
wrestler 
Mason 
Parris brought consistency back 
to the team as he dominated his 
bought.
Parris’ 20-5 win, including a 
technical fall and bonus points, 
proved instrumental in a victory 
that provided momentum and 
confidence to the wrestlers. 
“I think this team is still 
learning a lot but we are starting 
to come together,” Medley said. “I 
think a lot of our guys are starting 
to believe in themselves.”

Split decision

Michigan wrestling’s Jelani 
Embree battled Illinois’ Zac 
Braunagel for control in the 
184-pound match. 
Down 4-3 in the match, 
Braunagel went low, grabbed 
Embree’s legs and slammed 
him onto the mat to take the 
lead, 5-4. Braunagel finished 
Embree 
with 
a 
second 
thunderous takedown to end 
the match and clinch the 
meet for the No. 15 Illini (5-3 
overall, 2-2 Big Ten) giving 
them a 20-13 win over No. 23 
Michigan (5-3, 4-1) on Sunday 
afternoon. 
“I’ll say it wasn’t our best 
performance,” Michigan coach 
Sean Bormet said. “We lost 
some close matches. (Had) 
some attacks that didn’t finish 
cleanly, quickly. We had a 
couple matches in the middle 
get away from us with some 
bonus points.”

The Illini got off to a quick 
start, winning the first three 
matches. 
Travis 
Piotrowski 
had an early takedown in the 
133-pound match against the 
Wolverines’ 
redshirt 
senior 
Austin 
Assad. 
But 
Assad 
fought back before losing, 9-7. 
In the 141-pound 
match, 
Dylan 
Duncan 
swept 
freshman 
Cole 
Mattin 6-0 to 
extend 
Illinois 
to 9-0. Michigan 
responded 
in 
the 
149-pound 
match 
with 
redshirt 
junior 
Kanen 
Storr 
gaining a bonus 
point to cut the lead to 9-4. 
Redshirt freshman Will Lewan 
followed that up with another 
win over Eric Barone to cut the 
Illini lead to two. 
“I’d say Kanen Storr wrestled 
pretty well, offensively and 
on his feet,” Bormet said. 
“But he needs to find ways to 

take guys to their back off his 
takedowns (that’s) something 
he’s working on. He had some 
missed opportunities there. 
But I think Kanen wrestled 
really well on his feet.”
Junior Reece Hughes missed 
several early opportunities for 
takedowns 
in 
the 165-pound 
match. 
Danny 
Braunagel took 
advantage 
with two late 
takedowns and 
extended 
the 
Illinois 
lead 
with a bonus 
point to 13-7. 
Joey 
Gunther 
added another 
bonus point with a 15-3 major 
decision before Zac Braunagel 
clinched the win.
“Guys did some good things 
in really almost every match,” 
Bormet said. “Overall I thought 
we wrestled pretty hard. Just 
in some critical moments, we 
just didn’t get as tough as we 
needed to on some finishes, 
we didn’t get as tough as we 
needed to on some defenses.”
Redshirt 
senior 
Jackson 
Striggow 
won 
his 
match 
with a single leg takedown 
and 
sophomore 
Mason 
Parris dominated with four 
takedowns to add consolation 
victories for the Wolverines.
In the end it was too little, 
too late for Michigan, and 
Bormet believes there were 
several missed chances in the 
match.
“We’re going to continue to 
work on the things we’ve been 
working on which is finishing 
our 
leg 
attacks, 
defending 
our legs and mat returns,” 
Bormet said. “Those would be 
the three things we’re going 
to continue to work on. They 
were three areas that cost us 
some matches today.
“Every one of these guys had 
opportunities to score more, 
we left a lot of points on the 
match and it cost us a couple 
matches.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Win-coln, Nebraska

LINCOLN — It was decidedly 
different from the Michigan lineup 
that’s showed up most of this 
season, and decidedly different 
from the fast-paced, physical 
style of play that has become a 
trademark of the Wolverines this 
season.
Still, though, it was a win. And 
on Tuesday in Lincoln, when 
Michigan came in looking to 
snap a disheartening four-game 
losing skid and improve a bleak 
conference record, a win was more 
than enough.
The Michigan men’s basketball 
team (11-9 overall, 3-6 Big Ten) 
defeated Nebraska, 79-68, on the 
road on Tuesday night behind 
the leadership of junior guard Eli 
Brooks and an offensive explosion 
from 
freshman 
wing 
Franz 
Wagner.
Notably 
missing 
from 
Michigan’s lineup was senior 
point 
guard 
Zavier 
Simpson, 
who did not travel with the team 
after sustaining a suspension for 
violating a team policy. Junior 
forward Isaiah Livers travelled 
with the team but did not play 
after re-aggravating a lingering 
groin injury in Saturday’s game 
against Illinois. 
After a rocky start to the 
game, the Wolverines seemed 
to settle in. Brooks stepped into 
a commanding role on offense, 
contributing 20 points and nine 
rebounds on the night, while 
playing all but thirty seconds of 
the game.
“It was good to see guys like Eli 
Brooks step into that leadership 
role,” Michigan coach Juwan 
Howard said. “He’s been a leader 
throughout the year, so it wasn’t 
a surprise to me and the coaching 
staff.”
Wagner also helped provide 
some spark on offense, with 
18 points and eight rebounds 
on the night. It was a resilient 
performance from the freshman, 
who missed two free throws late 

Saturday that could’ve changed 
the game’s outcome; Wagner was 
visibly upset in Saturday’s post-
game press conference.
It was an offensive presence 
that 
Michigan 
has 
been 
missing without Livers, and the 
Wolverines’ offense was much 
the better for it. A combination of 
Wagner, Brooks and sophomore 
forward 
Brandon 
Johns, 
Jr. 
helped make up for the points 
lost when Simpson and Livers 
were sidelined; the three of them 
combined for 54 points and 24 
rebounds on the night.
“I just wanted to really focus 
on being active tonight on the 
offensive end,” Johns, Jr. said. 
“The more I move, the more I 
dive, I think it opens up a lot of 
perimeter play. So I think that the 
more I do that, the more I affect 
the game.”
Michigan put the game away for 
good with just under ten minutes 
left in regulation, going up 63-55 
on a three and then a dunk from 
Johns, Jr. From there, the game 
was never in question. Despite a 
valiant effort from Cornhuskers’ 
guards Cam Mack and Haanif 
Cheatham, who combined for 
36 points on the night, Nebraska 
couldn’t seem to keep up.
From there, the game was never 
in question. The Huskers never 
drew back within one possession 
of the Wolverines. It started to 
look more like the game that had 

been predicted between these 
two teams at the beginning of the 
season.
Without two of its best talents, 
Michigan got off to a slow start. 
DeJulius, in the starting lineup as 
a replacement for Simpson, had his 
ankles broken by Mack, who easily 
sank three with DeJulius out of the 
way. Wagner missed the response 
three, and after Cheatham made a 
layup, Michigan went down early, 
5-0.
A layup from Wagner and a 
wide-open three from junior 
guard Eli Brooks tied the game at 
five, but the Wolverines continued 
to struggle to put shots in the 
net, and after allowing another 
layup, they went into the under-
16 timeout trailing, 7-5. Things 
improved after the break, though; 
Michigan went down by four, 9-5 
and then 7-11, but drew within 
a one-point margin on another 
Brooks three-pointer, and took 
their first lead of the game, 12-11, 
on a layup from Wagner just inside 
the 13-minute mark.
“Franz is a high-IQ basketball 
player,” 
Howard 
said. 
“He 
knows that we need his offensive 
leadership. He knows that we need 
his offensive talent. And today, he 
did a really good job of mixing in 
both by attacking the basket and 
making outside shots.”
Ultimately, it was different. And 
it wasn’t always pretty.
But it was enough.

Michigan overcomes Simpson suspension to beat Nebraska, 79-68, snapping four-game losing streak

LINCOLN — What do you do 
when your most comfortable 
state is upended? When all sense 
of familiarity is thrown out the 
window?
For many, the answer may be 
to lose all sense of composure. 
Fold under the pressure that is 
the massive concept of perpetual 
and unexpected change and let 
the winds of chance sweep you 
away.
While 
this 
is 
clearly 
a 
melodramatic 
rendering 
of 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s game against Nebraska 
— the Big Ten’s worst team, per 
KenPom — Tuesday’s critical 
road win for the Wolverines was 
their ferocious shout into the 
wind.
For in the end, that’s all 
they could do. Shout or be 
suffocated 
under 
a 
set 
of 
bruising circumstances and an 
even tougher schedule. After all, 
Michigan’s two best players on 
the team — senior guard Zavier 
Simpson and junior forward 
Isaiah Livers — were out due 
to 
suspension 
and 
injury, 
respectively.
When it was all said and done, 
the Wolverines (12-8 overall, 
3-6 Big Ten) overcame a sense 
of overwhelming strangeness, 
showing the depth of their roster, 
to handle the Cornhuskers (7-14, 
2-8), winning 79-68.
In the hard-fought triumph, 
the Wolverines had to tap deep 
into the well of its players and 
talents in order to secure a 
hard-to-come-by road win. In 
doing so, Michigan looked like a 
completely different team than 
it had in months.
“Today, a coach like myself 
had to work a little extra,” 
Michigan coach Juwan Howard 
said. “And I don’t mind that. But 
our guys did an excellent job 
of collectively stepping in as a 
group and filling the void of one 
of our best players (Simpson).”

Junior 
guard 
Eli 
Brooks 
became 
the 
ball-dominant 
leader 
of 
the 
offense, 
distributing the ball and playing 
aggressive with repeated takes 
to the rim.
Sophomore forward Brandon 
Johns Jr. transformed into an 
offensive powerhouse, posting 
up defenders and shooting at a 
remarkably efficient clip.
Freshman 
forward 
Franz 
Wagner 
stopped 
shooting 
3-pointers and began attacking 
the basket — a marked departure 
from his offensive rhythm thus 
far.
Sophomore 
guard 
David 
DeJulius started his first career 
game.
Junior walk-on forward C.J. 
Baird played in a non-blowout 
regular season game.
All telltale signs of player 
development 
and 
rather 
unthinkable play calls for this 
Wolverine team with an entirely 
healthy roster. And for most 
of the game, it all started with 
Brooks and Johns.
With Livers and Simpson 
out of the picture, the floor was 
open for Johns to take charge 
on the offensive end. He would 
end the night with 16 points 
on 5-of-6 shooting and seven 
rebounds. Feeling dissatisfied 
with his level of movement on 
the floor during his previous 
opportunities, 
Johns 
made 
sure his feet were active on the 
hardwood, 
forcing 
defensive 
miscues, especially around the 
rim.
“I think the more I move, 
the more I dive,” Johns said. “I 
think it brings people to me, so 
it opens up perimeter players, so 
I think the more I do that, the 
more effective I can be.”
Added Howard: “He’s been 
huge for us all season. He’s 
been playing with a lot of 
energy, toughness, did a really 
good job on the glass, got some 
opportunities to score inside. 
Kid is just growing. Day by day, 
getting better game by game.”

By 
playing 
through 
this 
wrinkle 
in 
the 
roster, 
the 
Wolverines were able to fully 
display the talents of their 
players. One such byproduct of 
this set of circumstances came 
from the walk-on Baird.
With Wagner in foul trouble 
in the first half, Baird entered 
as his willing back-up, entering 
over 
scholarship 
player, 
freshman guard Cole Bajema. 
Regardless, his teammates were 
happy to see him finally get an 
opportunity.
“It was awesome,” Johns said, 
pausing to draw out the word 
‘awesome.’ “It was great seeing 
him out there. Just knowing 
what he does in practice and 
what he’s capable of doing, it 
was great seeing him out there. 
He should’ve played a little 
more confident, but I was just 
happy to see him out there.”
What’s more is that with 
Simpson off the floor, Wagner 
had the opportunity to expand 
his game beyond his normal 
sub-30 percent 3-point shooting 
mark and attack the basket. The 
freshman ended the night with 
18 points and more confidence in 
his shot selection.
“I thought attacking the rim 
was very important, I tried to 
do that,” Wagner said. “I think 
everybody tried to do that. 
At the start, I think we shot a 
little bit too much instead of 
playing to our advantage down 
low, but I think it was good 
towards the end that we kept 
staying aggressive attacking the 
basket.”
Johns. 
Brooks. 
DeJulius. 
Wagner. Baird. 
The list of players with an 
increased workload on Tuesday 
read like a laundry list, and in 
the end, with their postseason 
hopes on the line staring down a 
Quad 3 loss, they never batted an 
eye. They emotionlessly recited 
the mantra, “Next man up,” 
as drilled into their brains by 
Howard and continued shouting 
into the wind.

Pitching staff finding right mentality

Mentality.
It’s the word that’s guided 
Michigan 
softball’s 
pitching 
staff through the offseason. But 
for its top two arms, that means 
something different.
For junior left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien, that means not getting 
caught 
up 
in 
other 
people’s 
expectations. 
As a freshman in 2018, Beaubien 
raked in the accolades — everything 
from Big Ten Freshman and 
Pitcher of the Year to being named 
a first team All-American. She 
carried the pitching staff with 217 
innings and an ERA of 1.16. After 
a debut season like that, Beaubien 
felt the pressure to live up to her 
own reputation. 
While she was still a force in the 
circle the following season, she had 
her off days and failed to match the 
eye-catching ERA of her freshman 
year, posting an ERA of 1.87. With 
another season under her belt, 
Beaubien’s learned to take the 
pressure off. This offseason, she 
focused on a different approach. 
“I think a big lesson I can learn 
from last year is to not really think 
about my numbers or not really 
think about any of my previous 
seasons,” Beaubien said. “Even as 
the season goes on, not thinking 

about my previous games because 
I play my best when I’m not 
overthinking things, and I have a 
very active mind. Just focus on the 
game.”
For sophomore right-hander 
Alex Storako, that means finding 
her presence on the mound. 
By all accounts, Storako had 
a successful freshman season, 
racking up 142.1 innings and 
ending with an ERA of 2.02, but her 
biggest struggle was maintaining 
her composure when the pressure 
was on. She wasn’t able to make it 
through seven consecutive innings 
until March — her 10th appearance.
“I think she’s just come back 
more confident,” Beaubien said. “I 
think you can see it in situations 
where maybe her freshman year 
she would waiver a little bit if she 
gave up a couple hits or let a couple 
people on base. She shakes off 
mistakes really well and bounces 
back really well.”
Mental stamina has always 
been Storako’s biggest challenge. 
In several games, she’d start off 
strong, but begin to doubt herself 
after a couple well-placed hits. In 
these instances, Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins would opt to bring 
in Beaubien, the team’s reliable ace. 
But those days may be in the past. 
“I think she understands this 
level better,” Hutchins said. “She 
understands 
the 
expectations 

better. I think she knows better 
what to expect — I mean, that’s just 
something with freshmen. They 
just have to learn it. She’s more 
mature, noticeably. Her mentality 
has to be pitch to pitch. Finding the 
zone and then break it through the 
zone. I think she works hard, and 
keeping her mentality into killer 
instinct. She throws some fantastic 
pitches and great pitchers put them 
together and they slice up hitters.”
Though they have very different 
personalities, the pitchers have 
rubbed off on each other in many 
different ways both on and off the 
field — Beaubien has helped Storako 
work through the transition to 
collegiate ball and gotten her 
hooked on Marvel movies. 
They share the same work ethic 
and have worked together through 
the offseason to get in the right 
frame of mind. They go to bullpen 
practice together, run together 
and do ab workouts together. They 
both consider themselves to be 
competitive, and though they face 
different challenges, each pushes 
the other to work harder. 
It’s a mentality that breeds 
winning, and their competitive 
battles in practice have helped 
them grow into a formidable pair. 
Now, with an extra year under 
their belts, and the duo’s growth 
over the offseason, they look well 
set to dominate on the mound.

‘M’ top line leading way offensively

Throughout the first half of 
the season, Michigan’s line chart 
lacked one thing — stability.
For the first few weeks, coach 
Mel Pearson tried out some 
different 
combinations 
and 
witnessed varying degrees of 
success. He had senior forwards 
Will Lockwood and Nick Pastujov 
playing 
with 
freshman 
Eric 
Ciccolini in the first game of the 
season against Clarkson. The next 
night, Ciccolini was swapped 
out for redshirt sophomore Luke 
Morgan.
The revolving door at wing 
continued the next weekend when 
Morgan was replaced by senior 
forward Jake Slaker. This new 
line worked well together, having 
already played a stretch of games 
together the season before. But 
midway through their third game 
as a line, Slaker got injured. So 
again, Pearson had to shake up his 
lines.
That was the story for the first 
half of the Wolverines’ season. 
A line would play well together 
and seem to be building a bit of 
offensive chemistry, but then an 
injury would occur somewhere in 
the lineup and everything had to be 
reshuffled. 
When Lockwood got injured 
Nov. 8 against Minnesota, the 
two members of his line were 
separated. When freshman Johnny 
Beecher 
suffered 
a 
shoulder 
injury that limited his ability to 
take faceoffs, the winger on his 
line — sophomore forward Jimmy 
Lambert — stepped into the role 
of center. Then when Beecher 
returned, Lambert remained a 
center but was moved to a different 
line. Pearson just couldn’t find a 
stable lineup.
Each time a player had to miss 
games because of injury, budding 
chemistry was cut short.
“That’s what you’re looking for, 
some sort of chemistry on a line,” 
Pearson said. “We’ve had Johnny 
and Will at times together trying to 
find something, but because of all 
the injuries we had in the fall there 
… we had to juggle lines for a lot of 
different reasons. We couldn’t just 
have our full lineup.” 
Now with a fully healthy 

lineup and plenty of options, 
Pearson’s lines have yielded results 
throughout the second half of the 
season. Michigan has scored 16 
goals in its last four games, nearly 
doubling its goals per game average 
from the first 20 games.
That means in just four games, 
Michigan’s offense has produced 
over a third of the goals it scored in 
the first half. And while the scoring 
was shared between a number of 
players, one line in particular made 
significant offensive contributions.
It was a line of Lockwood, 
Beecher and freshman forward 
Nick Granowicz that combined 
for five of those goals. The line 
born out of necessity. Within the 
opening minutes of the first game 
against Notre Dame, Pearson knew 
he needed to mix a few things up to 
create the matchups he wanted. 
He 
was 
inspired 
by 
the 
chemistry 
between 
Lockwood 
and Beecher that had been evident 
in practice. They like playing 
together. They’ve got size, smarts, 
defensive awareness, speed. They 
just needed a little bit of grit, and 
that’s exactly what Granowicz 
brought.
With all these factors in mind, 
Pearson sent Granowicz, Beecher 
and Lockwood over the boards 
together midway through the 
first period of Friday night’s game 
against the Fighting Irish.
Beecher’s line generated plenty 
of offense and early in the third 
period, they found the back of the 
net. It wasn’t a typical goal, as the 
puck went in off Granowicz’s head 
as a result of crashing toward the 
goaltender.
“… We were on the road those 
four games,” Pearson said. “So 

whoever we put on the ice we felt 
comfortable first and foremost 
defensively. Then hopefully they 
can do something offensively. 
Because you don’t get last change. 
You don’t want to get a bad 
mismatch in those games because 
every game can come down to that 
one goal where it’s so close.”
While the line didn’t appear 
on 
the 
score 
sheet 
in 
the 
following game, it created many 
opportunities. It also made strong 
defensive plays.
Pearson was impressed. His 
team’s offense finally seemed to be 
catching fire. So the next weekend 
against then-No. 6 Penn State, he 
wasn’t taking any chances with 
adjusting lines.
That 
series, 
Granowicz, 
Lockwood and Beecher combined 
for four goals. The first night, 
Beecher scored two goals in the 
6-0 victory. Lockwood had three 
primary assists on the weekend. 
Most notably, though, Granowicz 
scored two important goals to 
boost his team to the extra point in 
double over time. 
“I think that’s kind of what 
our line needed,” Lockwood said. 
“(Granowicz has) been the key to 
our line. Beecher and I do a lot of 
the outside work, and he gets to 
those gritty areas. He’s been the 
guy that’s completed our line.” 
With 11 of 12 points in their 
last four games, Beecher’s line is 
emerging as an offensive power 
that came at a pivotal point in the 
season. Now, only Big Ten games 
remain on Michigan’s schedule. 
If it wants to extend the season 
beyond the first weekend of March, 
the goal scoring, led by this line, has 
to continue.

rowing 
up in the late 2000s, 
the best six days of the year 
were when my American Girl 
Magazine arrived in the mail. When I saw 
it on the counter under a stack of bills and 
advertisements, I ran up to my room and 
carefully opened the table of contents like 
it was precious candy. There was always a 
free poster, a craft, a quiz, an advice col-
umn and a featured reader smiling on the 
cover.
Many issues included interviews with 
the cover girls, who earned their face 
in print by volunteering at a commu-
nity garden, starting a jewelry business 
or organizing a clothing drive. I dreamt 
of being published in the magazine and 
entered writing and photo contests to do 
so, having photoshoots with my stuffed 
animals and trying to fit the vocabulary 
word “tchotchke” into a short story. I even 
started a business making collars for Web-
kinz stuffed animals in hopes I’d become a 
success story in the next issue.
Unsurprisingly, I spent more money on 
my business cards and bracelet beads than 
I made in actual revenue. Yet even though 
I never found my face on the cover or my 
story in the magazine, I set a foundation 
for my future pursuits in photography, 
writing and entrepreneurship. The maga-
zine undeniably shaped who I am today.
When I got older, I tried reading Girls’ 
Life, Teen Vogue and even Tiger Beat, 
which stressed me out with its loud colors 
and celebrity gossip. I read these maga-
zines for a few years, but I never cherished 
the moments spent with their pages like I 
did with American Girl Magazine. I guess 
I just didn’t care about which $90 hand-
bag matches which $200 cheetah-printed 
boots or if Maybelline mascara is less 

clumpy than CoverGirl — I 
didn’t even wear makeup or 
care about clothes until I got 
to college.
I recently discovered that 
American Girl Magazine stopped 
production in 2019. I had carelessly 
thrown out my issues around the time of 
high school graduation, but still searched 
my room in hopes of finding them. After 
no luck, I bought four 2009 issues on eBay.
I mourned the loss of the magazine not 
because I wanted to try its recipe for “fruit 
pizza” again, but because it represented a 
world where regular girls — not celebri-
ties — graced the cover of a mainstream 
magazine. It’s difficult to find anything 
similar to American Girl Magazine today, 
or even a magazine targeted at young girls 
whose covers don’t advertise “does your 
crush like you?” but rather “plan a spooky 
party.” 
Though the magazine is gone, the 
American Girl brand still thrives through 
their popular dolls. The franchise began 
producing dolls in the 1980s, years before 
the magazine began in 1992, and are now 
accompanied by books that gave each 
character a backstory. The dolls and their 
stories have been applauded for their 
diverse narratives that encompass how 
the average young girl lived during a spe-
cific time period, which is a demographic 
often left out of textbooks and elementary 
school classes. 
Historical characters included Addy, 
an African-American girl who escaped 
slavery; Kaya, a girl from the Nez Perce 
tribe living before white colonization; and 
Josefina, a Mexican girl living in Santa 
Fe while it was still Mexican territory. 
Recent dolls emphasize today’s diversity 
more than historical narratives, exempli-
fied by Joss, the 2020 doll of the year who 
is a surfer with a hearing aid. Customiz-
able “Truly Me” dolls are also available 
with various skin tones, boy and girl gen-
ders and accessories such as an insulin 
pump. 
I had two historical dolls of my own, 
Kirsten and Elizabeth, and loved their 
books so much that I went on to also read 

the other dolls’ stories. Much like the 
magazine, the books teach girls to be clev-
er and powerful without focusing on the 
presence of men. But owning the dolls is 
undeniably a privilege, with the doll and 
book alone costing upwards of $100, while 
the magazine was more accessible at $20 
for an annual subscription. 
American Girl Magazine was important 
not only for its accessibility but because it 
was a separate entity from the products. 
It wasn’t just another platform advertis-
ing the dolls, but a way to bridge the gap 
between the dolls’ historical narratives 
and modern narratives of girls doing good 
work today. This is arguably needed more 
than ever in an age where young girls are 
more vulnerable to toxic pressures than 
ever before.
As someone born between millennials 
and Generation Z, my childhood was influ-
enced by the digital world, but not defined 
by it. Today, girls from eight to 12 years old 
spend around six hours a day with enter-
tainment media — and while my child-
hood entertainment meant Webkinz and 
Club Penguin, today it means Instagram 
and TikTok, where girls as young as 15 put 
on makeup and tight clothing and perform 
for followers.
What other options do they have? If a 
young girl wants to read a girls-oriented 
magazine, she must choose one with a 
photoshopped celebrity on the cover often 
littered with tips about how to be appeal-
ing to men. If she wants to make a DIY 
craft, she will probably seek out a You-
Tube influencer to teach her, persuaded 
by their “authenticity” when they are like-
ly also performing for social capital.
Of course, there is still good work 
happening 
for 
girls’ 
empowerment 
online: Teen Vogue now publishes politi-
cal articles in addition to content about 
fashion and makeup, and Barbie releases 
animated vlogs covering feminist topics 
such as girls’ tendency to apologize more 
than boys. Competitors of American Girl 
are now trying to fill in the gaps in the 
digital world. 
Plus, American Girl still produces 
informational content — many will 

remember the books “The Care and Keep-
ing of You” which teaches girls about 
their growing bodies and “A Smart Girl’s 
Guide to Boys” which, despite becoming 
a meme (as a conversation starter, it rec-
ommends “I wish they’d teach us more 
about Vikings”), encourages curiosity and 
equality in relationships. More recently, 
the company released another guide to 
the digital world about how to safely navi-
gate the Internet. 
Yet, there is something deeply person-
al about a physical magazine that I wish 
girls today could experience. There was 
a sense that you were the only one read-
ing the issue and it was made for you spe-
cifically. It was sent to your house. You 
owned it and the information in it. That 
medium, in and of itself, was empower-
ing.
It is natural that American Girl is 
changing as American girls are changing. 
But while the instant gratification of the 
Internet can jumpstart imagination with 
information, young girls also don’t get 
downtime in between ideas. Consump-
tion becomes more appealing than action: 
When girls can stay in that media environ-
ment forever, they never have to sit back 
and work with what they’re given before 
the next issue arrives. 
I am anxiously waiting for my own cop-
ies to arrive from eBay. When they do, I’ll 
probably run to my room and pore over 
every word. Maybe it will feel more pre-
cious than before, knowing once the print 
issues are gone, all traces will be lost. But 
even though the magazine faded away 
before it could reach the girls of today 
and tomorrow, I know they will be clever 
enough to grow in the digital world. 
In fact, if they are anything like the 
American girls throughout the rest of his-
tory, I know they already are.

Girls


I

’ve recently noticed that when I talk 
to someone I’m just getting to know 
— a new classmate or coworker — and 
I tell a story that involves my boyfriend, 
I’ll refer to him as “one of my friends” or 
“this one guy.” It’s funny, and I feel a little 
strange after I say it, but it’s as if there’s a 
standard I can’t defy. This elusive standard 
keeps me in line with the expectation for 
young college women: Don’t appear too 
tied down, over-committed or like your 
relationship is the biggest part of your life.
Even writing that — that my relationship 
is one of the most important things in 
my life — makes me feel embarrassed. 
Ashamed, even. As a woman in college, 
there is the subliminal expectation that 
one should be unfettered, untethered and 
unencumbered. I’m supposed to be focused 
on school, friends, finding myself and 
figuring out what I want to do with my life. 
If I was following this ideal, I’d be 
“playing the field,” exploring my options 
and would be unconcerned with serious 
romantic relationships. If I was adhering 
to the expectation, I wouldn’t have to 
worry about replacing “boyfriend” with 
a less antiquated identifier in casual 
conversation. If I was doing college 
right, I’d be single, because that’s what 
young, well-educated, driven women are 
supposed to be at 21 — at least that’s who 
they are in the media and, it seems, who 
they are in contemporary feminism. It’s 
hard to ignore the seemingly limitless 
Odyssey, Her Campus and Elite Daily-
esque headlines shared on timelines that 
describe six, seven, 28 or some arbitrary 
number of reasons why you should stay 
single in college.
Before I was in a serious relationship, 
I tried all the things that I thought 
were supposed to make me feel sexually 
liberated and powerful: messaging with 
potential partners on apps, dating around 
and hooking up with different people. My 
closest friends had no problems doing it 
all — they even kept lists of former lovers 
on their phones in case any STI sourcing 
had to be done. But the more dates I went 
on and the more hookups I had, the lonelier 
I felt. 
I eventually stopped and took time to 
just be with myself, but I still felt pressure 
to try again. Friends told me I should get 
back out there. We’d gloomily joke around 
about how long it had been since I’d last 
had sex. It seemed like the common mantra 
was that I was missing out on something 
— that I wasn’t fully embracing all my 
sexuality had to offer — but I felt better and 
steadier on my own than I’d felt when I’d 
been “exploring all my options.”
And even though I’ve been in a happy, 
healthy and loving relationship with a 
person I truly consider my best friend for 
over a year now (this, too, somehow feels 
like something I should not publicly admit 
to — a significant other should never be the 

best friend), I still feel like I have 
to prove my feminism when it 
comes to relationships and love. I 
still feel like I have to prove I’m as 
modern a woman as the next one, 
despite choosing to be in a long-
term relationship at a young age. 
Whether it 
be 
deliberately 
not mentioning my boyfriend in 
conversation or feeling hesitant 
to write about just how important 
our relationship is to me, there 
exists a pressure to be a certain 
kind of woman when I’m young, 
and ironically, that ideal woman 
and her construction has roots in 
liberation.
The sexual revolution of the 
1960s, 70s and 80s formed the 
modern woman as we know her 
today. With widened access to 
birth control, the mainstreaming 
of sex in popular culture and 
the empowerment of women in 
education, careers and the home, 
women felt liberated from the former 
ideal of getting married at a young age and 
resigning themselves to life as a housewife.
Before the sexual revolution, post-war 
ideal 
womanhood 
involved 
marrying 
young, 
having 
and 
raising 
children 
and keeping house. Some 30 percent of 
women dyed their hair blond — which 
was considered more feminine — and 
department stores started to sell dress 
sizes three or four sizes smaller to match 
up with expectations that women have 
thinner physiques. Sex was reserved for 
marriage, and when it began to appear in 
the pop culture of the 1960s, there was 
widespread panic about moral upheaval.
But changes that began as freedoms 
have today narrowed into unattainable, 
unfair expectations for young women. 
That blooming sexuality of our parents’ 
generation has become twisted into a 
seemingly ideal image for girls: Being 
liberated and strong only happens when 
one invests wholly in herself — and that 
investment gets lower returns when it 
involves committing to someone else 
too soon. It sometimes feels like having 
sex has become a kind of currency: the 
more a woman has, the more sex-positive, 
progressive and feminist she is. She’s not 
held back, and her future is not jeopardized 
by commitment or, even worse, by a man.
Not only are these ideas not true, 
they’re harmful — to single women and 
women in relationships alike. But it’s 
hard to ignore their prevalence: In a 2012 
article, Hanna Rosin of The Atlantic 
writes, “To put it crudely, feminist 
progress right now largely depends on 
the existence of the hookup culture. 
And to a surprising degree, it is women 
— not men — who are perpetuating the 
culture, especially in school, cannily 
manipulating it to make space for their 

own success, always keeping their own 
ends in mind.”
In the same piece, she writes, “For 
college girls these days, an overly serious 
suitor fills the same role an accidental 
pregnancy did in the 19th century: a 
danger to be avoided at all costs, lest it get 
in the way of a promising future.”
In a 2013 interview with The New York 
Times, University of Michigan sociologist 
Elizabeth Armstrong explained that 
“increasingly, many privileged young 
people see college as a unique life stage in 
which they don’t — and shouldn’t — have 
obligations other than their own self-
development.”
In the same article, a young woman 
with a serious boyfriend told the Times 
that she felt “as if she were breaking a 
social taboo,” saying, “Am I allowed to 
find the person that I want to spend the 
rest of my life with when I’m 19? I don’t 
really know. It feels like I’m not.”
T

here is certainly an element 
of privilege in being able 
to 
write 
this: 
I 
am 
able 
to choose whether I want to be in a 
relationship or not. I am able to choose 
who I want to share myself with, whether 
that be in a long-term relationship, a 
hook up, a date or with no one at all — 
choices that were all afforded to me by 
the work of the feminist movement of 
the 20th century.
But those choices fail to erase the 
feelings of guilt that sometimes bubble 
up when I spend a Friday night with 
my boyfriend instead of my girlfriends. 
They fail to explain why I feel like I’m 
somehow outside the range of good, 
liberated, 
feminist 
behavior 
when 
instead of giving the guy at the party my 
number I unintentionally apologize to 
him, saying, “Sorry, I have a boyfriend.”

I am not desperately searching for a 
space to complain, nor am I questioning 
my decision to be in a relationship. 
Instead, I’m looking for a way to explain 
how frustrating it feels to have my 
decisions questioned for the supposed 
sake of my own womanhood. Am I not 
capable of choosing a life and a love 
for myself? Am I not a well-educated, 
driven, intelligent, young and modern 
woman who is able to decide for herself 
what her sexuality should entail?
These are not isolated feelings. I spoke 
to three other women at the University 
of Michigan who are in long-term 
relationships. The final question I asked 
each of them was this: Do you ever feel 
excluded from the feminist ideal of a 
woman because you are in a relationship? 
I let them individually define what they 
viewed as “the feminist ideal of a woman,” 
and as might be expected, they each had 
a different answer. Yet all three shared 
a similar feeling that they might, in 
some way, be dismissed because of their 
relationship status.
LSA senior Daija White, who met her 
significant other the first weekend of her 
freshman year, told me, “No, not at all. I 
am confident and capable on my own, I 
know what I want, and I am capable of 
achieving it with or without my partner.” 
She emphasized her own choice of being 
in a relationship, as well as her respect for 
every woman’s choices, but in the last few 
lines of her email to me, she wrote, “Maybe 
other women might think I’ve sold out or 
something, but that doesn’t matter much to 
me.”

I

n May of 2019, I sat staring at my 
reflection in a small rectangular 
mirror. I pulled my hair back 
tightly, entangling my fingers within locks 
of hair. Staring at my complexion I saw 
a round, egg-shaped face and pale pink 
lips that were cracked from unseasonably 
cold weather. I ran my hands through my 
hair, letting it fall to my shoulders. Some 
intertwined pieces coiled around one 
another forming knots. I laughed at the 
knots. It was a tangle of time — or it would 
be the last tangle for some time. Again, I 
pulled my hair back, asking myself “Will I 
like it? Why does that really matter?” 
The material security of a full head of 
hair blocked my ability to fully interrogate 
my relationship with it. It was a weight 
that shackled me into a performance of 
failed conformity. I wanted to rid myself of 
this performance — who am I rehearsing 
for? A week of heavy risk assessment left 
me embracing potential repercussions 
of shaving my head — which included 
frustrating 
my 
conservative 
family, 
accepting a new mirror image and being 
more vulnerable in public. 
Three friends came into the room and 
placed a pair of crafting scissors on the 
table in front of me. My untrained hands 
hacked away ropes of black hair, which 
swiftly entered freefall and landed in 
their ultimate resting place on the wooden 
floor. In one minute, I saw my face in an 
uneven set of bangs, an unnerving mullet 
and an asymmetrical pixie cut. With the 
haphazard smock left sitting on my head, 
the buzz of hair clippers began to drown 
out all sounds. 
The buzz stimulated a brief moment 
of regret. It was a buzz that represented 
both an aesthetic and a desire to be free 
of an aesthetic. It sounded through my 
self-destructive construction, adhered to 
my adolescent reflection and battled with 
my blemished foundation of femininity. 
The buzz oscillated in the room, vibrating 
through my hands, drumming in my ears 
and filling my eyes with curiosity — what 
a fragile form of finery hair is. 
I sat there looking at myself, not feeling 
as though the motions of my arms swiping 
the clippers back and forth were my own. 
I was looking at the mirror, but felt like 
I was sitting front row at a hazy film 
showing, in which I was the protagonist.
My head felt like soft carpet. 
Hot tears leapt from my cheeks in the 
overwhelming moment of instantaneous 
change, of complex austerity. I was 
reintroduced to myself in the small 
rectangular mirror. 

In the last decade, more women and 
non-binary 
folks 
have 
shaved 
their 
heads in an effort to subvert mainstream 
heteronormative 
and 
patriarchal 
beauty standards. At the same time, 
the mainstream media focus on this 
trend has consistently highlighted those 
who meet Eurocentric and/or feminine 
beauty standards. In January 2018, the 
pages of beauty magazine Allure were 
adorned with glamorous pictures of high-
fashion models for a feature about women 
who shaved their heads as a sartorial 
statement. Similarly, the New York Times 
shared stories of female models who 
shaved their heads — again perpetuating 
the idea that a buzzcut is only a fashionable 
hairstyle if you have a femme face or “the 
right head shape.” 
LSA senior Taylor Luthe (she/her) 
decided to shave her head twice in the 
summer of 2019. She agreed that many 
of the bald women that are perceived 
as beautiful had features that were 
stereotypically female. During that time, 
she noticed parts of herself that made her 
sometimes insecure about the decision.
“It was hard seeing little parts and 
pieces of your body, like in pictures, in 
the mirror, and not having ever seen those 
before. And then really over-analyzing 
those. Like ‘Oh, is that what the back of my 
neck looks like? Is there a roll?’ ” 
Even as a radical feminist, Taylor 
acknowledged that she held deep-rooted 
ideas of gendered beauty. She asked herself, 
“Who do I need to feel feminine for? Why 
do I need to embody these characteristics 
if I already feel okay within myself about 
who I am and how I act in the world?”
A shaved head has not, and will never 
be, reserved for those with “suitable” 
features. Promoting this narrative over 
others excludes those who shave for 
gender expression, sexual orientation or 
freedom from gendered beauty. Though 
it is perfectly acceptable to buzz for a 
fashion look, media outlets that fail to 
include varying perspectives, identities 
and experiences beyond runway trends 
continue to silence individuals who have 
been harmed by a binary promotion of 
beauty. 
The physical action of shaving one’s 
head is the same for everyone, but the 
reasons behind the decision are beautifully 
dissimilar. For LSA sophomore Aldo Pando 
Girard (he/they), hair has been something 
that has always separated them from their 
peers. “It was a big thing for me to be like 
no white people are going to touch my 
hair, ever, period, at all,” Aldo said. 

Aldo is Cuban and Black, and has 
experimented with a variety of hairstyles 
throughout their college career. From 
box braids to waves, changes in their hair 
have often left friends initially disoriented 
upon seeing them.
“It’s been weird making big changes to 
my hair and people not recognizing me, 
that has been very surreal,” they said. “My 
hair is just pretty closely tied to how I view 
myself and how I can express myself.” 
As someone who is gender fluid and 
likes to stretch and surpass traditional 
masculine 
beauty 
ideals, shaving their 
head made Aldo feel 
as though they had 
less control over their 
outward perception. 
It made them feel 
more masculine and 
publicly 
perceived 
as masculine, even 
when 
they 
had 
the 
desire 
to 
be 
androgynous.
LSA senior Leena 
Ghannam 
(they/
them) shaved for a 
more 
androgynous 
look. 
Their 
relationship 
with 
their hair has been 
“antagonistic” 
partly due to their 
hometown. 
“To 
have 
curly 
hair or kinky hair, 
especially 
because 
I grew up in a town 
that 
was 
majority 
white, I did not feel 
comfortable with the 
texture of my hair, 
and the quantity of it 
also,” Leena said.
They are from a 
Palestinian 
family 
that holds traditional ideals about the 
female appearance. When shaving their 
head, the “fear of family reaction” was a 
pressing thought. But the action ultimately 
aided 
in 
healing 
that 
“tumultuous” 
relationship they had with their hair, 
making the threat of family backlash a 
worthy fight. “It felt like a weird worship 
of hair, or an appreciation of it, but also 
a castration of it. It helped me develop a 
much better relationship with my hair,” 
they said. 
In 
addition 
to 
looking 
more 
androgynous, Leena also shaved to help 

prevent the symptoms of trichotillomania 
— a somatic symptom of anxiety and OCD 
that causes an uncontrollable urge to 
pluck hair.
My desire to shave my head was similar 
to Leena’s. At age thirteen, I started losing 
the hair on my head from trichotillomania. 
The idiomatic expression “I want to 
pull my hair out” exposes a real and 
diagnosable disorder. 
A 
2002 
University 
of 
Wisconsin–
Madison study found at least 13 percent 
of adults in the United States engage 

in 
body-focused 
repetitive 
behaviors 
(BFRBs). Of the 13 percent, an estimated 
one to two percent of the population has 
trichotillomania. I didn’t meet someone 
with this disorder until I was 20 years old. 
We cried, hand-in-hand, understanding 
one another without words. 
Hair-pulling triggered my first head-
shaving fantasies. The only place where 
it was socially acceptable for women to 
be hairy was your head, and my scalp 
was being picked clean. The strands that 
sprouted from my head were of varying 
lengths after years of plucking in high 

school. A healthy mane only seemed 
attainable if I buzzed it down to the root, 
but the thought of being a teenage girl 
with a shaved head in a religious and 
conservative 
community 
deterred 
all 
plans of execution. My body only became 
a vehicle for expression once I entered 
college. 
My parents were not happy the first time 
I came home with a buzzcut. My mom’s 
first questions were: “What’s wrong? Are 
you gay? Why did you do this?” Though I 
knew the reasons behind my decision, it 

was hard to come home to a place where 
my appearance was not only unacceptable 
but also immediately and constantly 
questioned.
The history of shaved heads is one that 
is full of freedom — but also deviance. 
It’s been used to physically display an 
entrance into a group or an obliteration 
of individuality — a social tariff on social 
interactions. The common associations of 
shaved heads are of religious conformity, 
military admission or a chemotherapy 
patient. Throughout history and in most 
places, women and men have parted 

with their hair for reasons of religious 
purification, 
public 
humiliation 
or 
cultural erasure. 
For instance, after World War II, French 
women accused of sleeping with German 
soldiers were publicly humiliated by 
having their heads shaved. “The shorn 
women” were forced to walk through the 
streets bald, with swastikas painted on 
their bodies. Some 20,000 women were 
shamed in the streets. 
During 
the 
Atlantic 
Slave 
Trade, 
Africans were captured by colonizers and 
their hair was cut 
off. 
This 
signified 
an 
eradication 
of 
personality 
and 
culture, as head and 
hair adornment was 
a fundamental part of 
one’s wardrobe.
These 
dark 
histories still inform 
perceptions 
of 
shaved heads, even 
though 
practicality, 
convenience, 
androgyny 
and 
style are now the 
predominant factors. 
LSA junior Hannah 
Meyers 
(she/they) 
has shaved their head 
three times in their 
life. The last time 
they 
shaved 
their 
head, it was because 
of a bad bleach and 
hair-coloring 
job. 
Even in the messy 
moment, 
shaving 
their head was saving 
their hair. 
“I feel like the 
Britney 
moment 
came before the head 
shaving, and the head 
shaving was like the 
reclaiming of the moment,” they said. “It 
was starting over.”
Recently, she entered the workforce 
as a middle school student teacher. 
Hair is used as a uniform for students 
and 
teachers 
alike. 
Students 
with 
nonconforming hairstyles can be subject 
to expulsion. Teachers can be fired for not 
setting appropriate examples. But Hannah 
believes that their choices regarding body 
and head hair will be a model for younger 
children.
“I am questioning what it means to be 
hairy or not hairy in the workforce. I want 

to be a public school teacher, I’m getting 
certified for middle or high school. I’m 
not sure which one I would prefer yet,” 
Hannah said. “Working with young kids 
who are just forming their opinions, I 
think it’s important to have people who 
they look up to who they see different 
options of what to do with their hair.” 
At the first extended family gathering 
since my buzzcut, my grandmother came 
up to me, smiled and said I looked like 
“an Italian opera singer.” I was incredibly 
surprised. I had already put up defenses, 
practicing half-true explanations for the 
buzzcut. When my grandmother was 
growing up in Italy in the 1930s and 40s, 
the common hairstyle for women was a 
short cut. The disparity between how my 
mother and grandmother reacted to my 
hair must have been due to the fluctuating 
ideals of femininity and hair. 
In 2016, Time magazine talked to 
historians who track the social and 
gendered history of hair. Long hair was 
a status symbol as complex hairstyles 
require the help of another person 
demonstrating wealth and power. In the 
U.S., though, women began cutting their 
hair into bobs during World War I, a trend 
attributed to military nurses adopting 
shorter cuts for convenience and hygiene. 
In the 1920s, many American schools 
and churches rallied against flappers 
for “acting like men.” A shaved head has 
never formally been an accepted style for 
women. A woman’s hair has long been 
regarded as the key to her femininity and 
a persuasive symbol of her sexuality. 
Zoe Cutler (she/her) is a graduate 
student at the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance. As a trans woman, Zoe’s chosen 
hairstyle has much more to do with her 
identity as a lesbian. She never actually 
shaved her hair, but keeps a short hairstyle 
to “lean into the butch aesthetic,” and to 
“establish a specific genre of womanhood.”
“I think originally, I was trying to lean 
into some more classic model or like a 
mainstream model of womanhood that 
wasn’t really working for me in various 
ways. And so that was something that I 
could latch onto,” Zoe said. 
Femininity 
has 
invariably 
been 
synonymous with long hair, but the regular 
removal of body hair is a relatively recent 
phenomenon, gaining steam in the 1970s 
during Second Wave Feminism. Former 
Atlantic writer Nadine Ajaka traces the 
original campaign against women’s hair to 
Darwin’s evolutionary theory in the mid-
nineteenth century where scientists were 
determined to show hairiness in women as 

“indicative of deviance” from femininity 
and the white race. 
Heavy-handed marketing techniques 
from companies, like Gillette, convinced 
adolescent girls that a women’s right of 
passage included shaving your legs. Those 
girls became our mothers’ mothers, and 
our mothers brought the idea into this 
generation — an oral tradition. 
Recently, Gillette was criticized for 
the “pink tax” they placed on female hair 
removal products. The “pink tax” refers 
to the price disparity between men and 
women’s commercial hygiene products. 
I can’t remember the exact day I 
started attaching abstract ideas to the 
presence of natural hairs growing from 
my body, but once my classmates could 
label me in one word — hairy — my 
reflection was no longer an impression 
of my appearance, but instead a place of 
personal scrutiny. All my features were 
up for reevaluation. My Mediterranean 
and Arabic genealogy was not forgiving 
in an era that idolized and still idolizes 
hairlessness. 
With leftover lunch money in my 
pocket, I would bike to CVS half a mile 
from my house and buy Sally Hansen Body 
Hair Bleach Cream – Extra Strength. In 
those impatient 13 minutes, my arm hair 
was lightening and my skin was faintly 
burning, but my excitement was rising. 
From ages nine to 19 I tried plucking, 
shaving, waxing, threading, chemically-
removing, lasering and bleaching most 
of the hair on my body. These removal-
rituals began prior to my understanding 
that the male gaze was the origin of the 
assault on women’s body hair. 
The regrowth of my shaved head 
has been a space for me to interrogate 
gendered beauty ideals. A shaved head does 
eventually grow back, but the experience 
has left me with a permanent introspection 
of my reflection’s foundation. There was a 
time when I ran around with a dark brown 
bob and a set of bangs that would tickle my 
eyelids in the weeks my mother forgot to 
trim them. And that’s all hair was to me. 
The unlearning process is slow, but I am 
confident knowing that the presence of 
hair on my head or body — or lack thereof 
— will not play a role in defining my 
femininity.

What’s with the crows?

I

t’s late. You’re walking home from 
somewhere on campus, maybe 
Mason Hall or the Michigan 
League. Walking through the cold, 
wintery night air, you hear drops on the 
ground and movements in the trees. You 
look up and see dozens — even hundreds 
— of American black crows peppering the 
branches. You bolt, hearing more drops, 
while covering your head and ducking. 
If you’ve seen the Alfred Hitchcock 
film, “Birds”, you let out a yell, causing 
the birds to take off into the night sky. 
Hopefully you’ve made a daring escape 
from the crows, averting a crisis … for 
now.
I’ve found myself in this scenario 
more than a few times. I want to be 
clear, though: I am not afraid of birds. 
As a child, I would go birdwatching with 
my dad, and still today our shelves are 
filled with many editions of “The Sibley 
Guide to Birds.” Rather, I find that birds 
have a mystique about them. My friends 
and I were once confronted by a man in 
Washington, D.C. who claimed that birds 
aren’t real. The basis for his theory was 
that none of us have touched a bird so, 
therefore, birds can’t possibly be real. 
Now even ads on my social media have 
been trying to sell me “Birds Aren’t Real” 
t-shirts. But these murders of crows in 
Ann Arbor certainly are real (yes, the 
term “murder” to refer to a group of 
crows is also real).
Assistant Professor Ben Winger, the 
University of Michigan’s curator of 
birds, had the answers to all my burning 
questions concerning the crows. The 
best way to avoid them is in the daylight. 
The only trace of the crows during the 
daytime is their “whitewash,” which 
is a “polite term” for bird poop used by 
Winger during our interview. He also 
told me that the American crow, known 
scientifically as Corvus brachyrhynchos, 
tends to become more social in the winter. 
“A lot of (crow) species form these big 
roosts in the winter. They’re not unique 
to Ann Arbor,” Winger said. “... Basically 
during the wintertime, when there’s not 
much food and it’s colder in a lot of places, 
crows will just form these enormous 
nighttime roosts and they’ll become very 
social.”
These roosts can be seen in Ann Arbor 
in the nighttime, as leafless trees become 
covered with black tops. While the exact 
reason for this roosting is not known, 
Winger gave a number of ideas.
“One idea is, first of all, it’s a safety in 
numbers type thing so they can better 
avoid predators when they’re in flocks,” 
Winger said. “Another idea is that food 
is really scarce in the winter, but crows 
are very smart and they’re very social 
and they can probably exchange a lot of 
information amongst each other about 
where food is.”

The city of Ann Arbor, compared to 
woods or fields, seems to be a haven 
for crows due to its warmth and light 
sources, which is to the advantage of 
crows, according to Winger.
“And as for why Ann Arbor, it’s actually 
not uncommon for them to be around 
towns … It’s probably a combination 
of it being a little bit warmer than the 
surrounding environment but also I 
think the light, since the campus is 
pretty well lit at night,” Winger said. “So 
in some contexts, artificial light is bad for 
birds but in this context, the crows might 
prefer it because they can more easily 
spot owls and other predators.”
Unlike Hitchcock’s 1963 horror classic, 
the crows will not be attacking humans 
anytime soon.
“I don’t think they’re a threat to other 
species and they’re not a threat to humans 
either, I should add,” Winger said. 
Though it’s slightly disappointing to 
know that it’s unnecessary to run from 
the crows in terms of avoiding attack, 
some people in the past have gone 
to extreme measures to avoid them. 
According to the Audubon Society, the 
United States’ eminent association of 
birders, one extermination effort in the 
past has included the “dynamiting of 
winter roosts.” 
Engineering freshman Vanya Lazarevic 
is quite familiar with the crows at Helen 
Newberry Residence Hall. She thought 
the birds — which she initially mistook to 
be geese — were just passing through for 
a day or two. Now, Lazarevic is struggling 
to get a good night’s sleep with the crows 
roosting outside for months.
“I feel like it was fine the first two weeks 
but the fact that they just keep returning 
is just very annoying.” Lazarevic said. 
“I actually slept with earbuds in and it 
helped. Light sleepers don’t have it easy.”
While the crows have disturbed her 
sleeping, the whitewash left behind is 
also unpleasant. Often patches of campus 
will be covered in white splotches from 
the crows roosting above, coloring 
anything from the sidewalks to cars a 
shade of white with specks of brown.
“Just stepping in bird poop in the 
morning is not a mood,” Lazarevic said. 
“You can’t just get rid of the crows.”
The presence of crow feces across 
campus is unpleasant, and there’s some 
speculation that it could drive away 
prospective students and visitors to 
campus. 
With this being my fourth winter at 
the University, I told Lazarevic that this 
is not a one-time deal: The crows are 
a wintertime staple in Ann Arbor. Her 
response: “I hate that.” 
In my research about the crows, I 
came across an article published by The 
Daily in 2011. Robert Payne, a former 
University professor, estimated a count 

of 10,000 crows in Ann Arbor while the 
Washtenaw County Audubon Society 
chapter counted 30,000 in their annual 
Christmas bird count. I interviewed 
Sherri 
Smith, 
an 
Audobon 
Society 
member since the 1980s and a former 
president of the chapter, to hear the 
thoughts of a true local birder. 
Smith finds the crows fascinating 
because of their intelligence and unique 
behavior. When I asked about the 
numbers from the annual bird count, 
she said they weren’t able to get a good 
count because of the sheer size and the 
movement of the crows, but she did offer 
an estimate.
“I’d guess there’s 11,000 or 12,000,” 
Smith said.
Smith provided the best analogy for 
when the crows can be seen flying at 
dusk.
“They all take off like a tornado going 
to wherever they’re going to spend the 
night.”
I’ve witnessed the site a number of 
times, always whipping my phone out 
to film the spectacle. Looking through 
my Snapchat memories, I find videos 
from across campus filming the crows 
covering the night sky. Most recently, 
seemingly hundreds came flying over the 
Intramural Sports Building. 
The 
crows 
were 
the 
subject 
of 
an op-ed to The Daily last year, calling 
for sustainable practices to control 
the crow population. There have been 
efforts in the past, though some were 
illegal and not very sustainable — such 
as the mass poisoning of crows in 2008 
and 2009, which was investigated by 
the Department of Natural Resources. 
An 
article 
published 
by 
Michigan 
News, 
the 
University-run 
media 
service, informed the public that flare 
guns were being used to scare off the 
crows. Smith also mentioned that in 
the past, a University employee told 
her they used firecrackers to scare off 
the crows. In 2016, the LSA Student 
Government passed a resolution calling 
on the Ann Arbor government to 
investigate the crow population. 
The fact of the matter is that crows 
like Ann Arbor for the lights, trees and 
warmth. No, they aren’t going to fly down 
and peck at you. I find the hundreds 
of crows flying reminiscent of David 
Attenborough’s Planet Earth, almost like 
the crows are some exotic species flying 
in the thousands to evade predators. This 
isn’t to say I — like the majority of campus 
— don’t have a distaste for the crows, I 
certainly do, but they’re not the boring 
creature one might presume them to be. 
So, when you’re strolling home after a 
long day and the sidewalks are quiet and 
deserted, look up. You might find some 
friendly faces dropping gifts for you as 
you pass by.

I

n a past life, I ran. For all four years 
of high school, I was a member of the 
junior varsity cross country team, 
having joined on a mandate from my mom: I 
had to do a sport in high school to keep busy, 
be healthy and stay “socially stimulated.” Ball 
sports were an automatic no for someone like 
me, who’d been hit in the face with a basket-
ball during gym class one too many times, 
and you didn’t have to try out for cross coun-
try. Plus my older cousin Jackie was already 
on the team, so I figured that might give me 
a leg up in the social scene. Cross country it 
was, then. 
This fall, three years after my last cross 
country race, I found myself struggling to 
propel my body down Stadium Boulevard 
in Ann Arbor after I’d vowed to start run-
ning again. My destination was Washtenaw 
Avenue, and as I inched down the sidewalk, 
I finally began to see a stoplight in the dis-
tance. I picked up the pace a little because I 
knew the faster I got to the light, the faster I 
could be done. But when I neared the light, I 
saw that it wasn’t Washtenaw at all. I realized 
I hadn’t even passed the Trader Joe’s yet. I 
still had so much left to run before I could 
rest. Holy shit, I thought, trying to surrepti-
tiously wipe my runny nose, what have I got-
ten myself into? 
I

’ve never thought of myself as an ath-
lete. In elementary school, I danced 
for a few years. I did gymnastics, 
played rec softball and soccer. None of it 
stuck, though, and as the talent of my peers 
increased and mine plateaued, I’d drop each 
sport without much remorse — I preferred 
to explore other interests, like reading nov-
els and writing articles for a weekly news-
paper I distributed at my extended family’s 
Friday night dinners. I still did “athletic” 

things: I rode my 
bike around the 
neighborhood all 
the time, my dad 
taught me how to 
ride a unicycle and 
I learned to love 
hiking and canoe-
ing 
during 
my 
summers at sleep-
away camp. Still, 
I had this percep-
tion of athletes as 
talented, competi-
tive people with 
an intense love for 
physical activity — 
and none of those 
childhood activi-
ties ever made me 
feel like an athlete 
in that sense. 
I

t’s 
hard 
to 
believe 
now that I 
stuck with cross 
country for all four years of high school. 
Most of the memories that linger involve seri-
ous pain and total mental anguish. I couldn’t 
walk for two months sophomore year 
because I’d given myself horrible shin splints 
on both legs. I can also remember the refrain 
that would run through my head every time 
I ran a race: “If you finish this race, you never 
have to run again, ever.” Of course, I would 
always go back to practice the next day.
I recently came across two of my high 
school journals while rooting through the 
drawer of my bedside table. Sure enough, the 
first entry I saw when I opened the purple 
notebook from my senior year confirmed my 
memories.
“I dread going back to school 90% because 
of XC,” I wrote on Aug. 30, 2015, a few days 
before I began my senior year. “I don’t mind 
the other parts of it so much, but UGH I just 
hate cross country and I want to love it ... but 
oy, I can’t.” 
When I read that, I remembered the dread 
I felt just driving by the high school that 
August. I remembered the desire to either 
become a “real” runner or stop having to 
pretend I felt like one. I shuddered under the 
weight of the memories as I closed the diary. 
Then I opened the second journal, this 
one an earlier volume that I filled throughout 
my freshman year. On Sep. 18, 2012, I wrote: 
“I have cross-country every single day after 
school. OH MY GOD, it’s so hard! It’s the best 
kind of hard, though, because I feel so accom-
plished after I run.” And on Nov. 2: “I can’t 
believe the season’s over!! I’m SO glad I did it; 
I made so many amazing friends. I loved XC.”
I was so taken aback after reading those 
entries that I had to lie down on my bedroom 
floor. I couldn’t help but laugh. How in the 
world had I gone from that level of enthu-

siasm freshman year to the pessimism of 
senior year? And why were those final mem-
ories the only ones I remembered? 
I

f nothing else, running gives you a 
lot of time to think, and as I trudged 
down the street five days after begin-
ning to run again, the journal entries kept 
popping into my mind. I thought about how 
I’d felt both grown up and protected when 
the older girls on the cross country team took 
me on a tour of the high school even before 
freshman orientation. I thought about the 
team sleepover we’d had and how cool I’d felt 
just hearing two of the seniors on the team 
talk nonchalantly about having “naked pool 
parties” with their boyfriends. I thought 
about the sense of accomplishment I felt from 
making it up the notoriously awful hill at 
Kensington Metropark. I didn’t run fast that 
first season, but it didn’t matter. I was push-
ing myself. I was growing. I was having fun. 
Thinking about cross country made me 
think about the concept of strength. The 
summer before my sophomore year, I missed 
most of the team’s summer practices because 
I was away at camp, and when I came back 
to practice in the early fall, I was incredibly 
out of shape. The brand new freshmen were 
outrunning me and I couldn’t complete the 
3-mile run without stopping. I remember 
sobbing to my mom about how embarrass-
ing it felt to still be running at the back after 
a full year on the team. I remember the pain 
that rattled through my shins during those 
first few practices of the year, and the shame 
that came from learning it wasn’t even a 
stress fracture, just stupid shin splints, which 
everyone gets. I remember sprints practice 
on the soccer field, watching my teammate 
Ioana limp through her own injury as I sat 
out entirely. Of course, now I understand 
how serious shin splints are and that running 
would have been unsafe for me that season. 
But all I knew then was that Ioana was strong 
enough to push through her injury, and I 
wasn’t. I remember thinking: I must not be a 
runner. I must not be an athlete. 
L

abeling myself in any way made 
me feel vulnerable as a kid. To call 
myself an athlete was to tell the 
world I thought of myself as a person with 
certain talents and passions. What if I called 
myself a runner but people saw me running in 
the back of the pack? What if I called myself 
a writer but people didn’t like my stories? I 
worried so much about what other people 
would think of my labels that I never thought 
to define the terms for myself. I wonder now 
if it would have mattered that I didn’t con-
sider myself a runner if others had. Which is 
more important: what others think of me, or 
how I think of myself? Can I even separate 
those perceptions from one another? 
When I applied to colleges my senior 
year of high school, I thought for a long time 
about what I should write in my application 
essays. Although I didn’t decide I wanted to 

be a writer until my sophomore year of col-
lege, there must have been some deep-seated 
desire in me to go down that path, because I 
remember hesitating to write about my love 
for writing in my essays. What would hap-
pen, I’d fret, if I wrote that I wanted to be a 
writer, but the admissions counselor didn’t 
think I had any writing talent? I’d be bearing 
my whole soul right there on the page, and 
the reader would have the authority to decide 
my fate. It was too risky. I wrote about other 
topics instead. 
I’m no longer afraid to call myself a writer, 
but the confidence in that label didn’t take 
hold until I became the Editor in Chief of my 
college newspaper. Even as a staff reporter, 
I still felt like I only dabbled in writing, and 
that anyone who was a “real” writer would 
laugh if they knew I was calling myself one, 
too. 
Perhaps this preoccupation with how oth-
ers perceive our labels impacted my view of 
my cross country experience. It was accept-
able, expected even, to be a less talented 
runner freshman year. It wasn’t as common 
to still be running in JV races as a senior. 
Everyone got injured at one point or another, 
but not everyone decided to sit out for three-
quarters of the season because of shin splints. 
Maybe the contempt I expressed in my senior 
year diary and the unhappy memories that 
remain of the experience stemmed from a 
subconscious effort to create cognitive disso-
nance between myself and the sport. Maybe I 
was trying to signal to the outside world that 
I didn’t care if I was a slow runner, because 
I didn’t enjoy running at all. I didn’t feel like 
I deserved the running label, so I shunned 
the sport altogether. Would I have gone on 
to love running if I hadn’t been so afraid of 
labels? 
I think about what would have happened 
if I’d shied away from writing, too. I never 
would have joined The Michigan Daily. I 
never would have become Editor in Chief. 
My whole identity would be different. 
Though I’ve started running again, I’m 
still not sure if I’ll ever be able to call myself 
a runner — at least not with the same con-
fidence I have in calling myself a writer. I’d 
like to say I’ve matured beyond the point of 
caring about how others viewed me, but part 
of me still thinks I’d feel like an imposter if I 
claimed the label. I have to wonder, though 
— does it even matter? I’m running again and 
feeling good about it. This time I’m not going 
to let a label — or lack thereof — dictate how I 
feel about the sport as a whole. For now, you 
can catch me trudging down Stadium Bou-
levard. I’ll have a better sense of where my 
landmarks are this time.
