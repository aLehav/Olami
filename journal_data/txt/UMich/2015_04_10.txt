ADMINISTRATION

Trigger warning 
before AAU sexual 

assault survey 

called insufficient

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

After the University distributed 

a survey to students earlier this 
month to gauge campus climate 
around sexual misconduct, some 
students have expressed concerns 
with the terminology used in the 
survey.

The survey is administered 

by the Association of American 
Universities. Twenty-eight public 
and private research universities 
employed the survey, making it one 
of the largest surveys on this issue.

“Our 
primary 
purpose 
in 

conducting this survey is to help 
our institutions gain a better 
understanding of this complex 
problem on their own campuses as 
well as nationally,” AAU President 
Hunter Rawlings said in a press 
release. “Our first priority, and 

theirs, is to ensure that students 
not only are safe but feel safe. 
Universities will be using their 
data to inform their own policies 
and practices regarding sexual 
assault.”

However, 
some 
University 

students said they stopped taking 
or were advised by friends against 
taking the AAU survey due to 
triggering imagery and wording.

LSA junior Fabiana Diaz, who 

said she is survivor of sexual 
assault, received a warning not to 
take the survey from a friend due 
to graphic scenarios that could be 
triggering for her.

“I was upset because I think 

more 
importantly 
than 
other 

students, it needs the voice of the 
survivors in order for something to 
actually be done on our campus,” 
Diaz said.

The survey asks students a 

variety of questions regarding to 
their experiences with campus 
sexual 
assault, 
knowledge 
of 

prevention and available resources.

The survey is separated into 

lettered sections, each asking 
about a particular aspect of a

U.S. House Representative Debbie Dingell hosts a roundtable on college affordability at the Michigan Union on Thursday.

Students identify 
affordable housing, 
textbook costs as 

key concerns

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

U.S. House Rep. Debbie Ding-

ell (D–Mich.) joined students 
and college administrators from 
across the state in Ann Arbor 
on Thursday to discuss college 

affordability.

Dingell, who hosted the event, 

began the round table by outlin-
ing challenges faced by many stu-
dents, especially when it comes to 
large amounts of loan debt.

“We’re all concerned at the 

staggering amount of student 
debt that we now see in this coun-
try,” she said. “Nearly 40 million 
Americans owe $1.3 trillion in 
student loan debt. And 1.5 million 
people here in Michigan owe $39 
billion.”

Dingell highlighted a particu-

lar bill she’s co-sponsoring, the 

Bank on Students Emergency 
Loan Refinancing Act, which 
would allow borrowers with fed-
eral student loans to refinance 
their loans. Refinancing loans can 
lead to lower interest rates.

“You can refinance a mort-

gage, you can refinance a car, but 
you can’t refinance your student 
loans,” Dingell said. “We want to 
be able to help you and those that 
have gone before you that have got 
some of this staggering debt refi-
nanced to a lower level.”

Dingell said at the undergradu-

ate level, refinancing could save 

students $4,000 on a $30,000 
loan.

She also touched on the various 

restrictions on federal grants like 
Pell Grants, such as the require-
ment that recipients complete 
their education in six years.

“I believe that each student is a 

different student,” she said. “The 
UM-Dearborn campus and the 
UM-Flint campus has students 
with families ... that are working 
to support a household and chil-
dren and trying to get an educa-
tion.”

POLICY

Statement of 

Student Rights and 

Responsibilities 
could see changes

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

The University plans to review 

its Statement of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities during the 2015-
2016 academic year, according to 
an e-mail from E. Royster Harper, 
vice president for student life, sent 
to students, faculty and staff on 
Thursday.

The statement outlines student 

conduct expectations consistent 
with the University’s values, and 
suggests sanctions and disciplin-
ary procedures if those expecta-
tions are not met.

“This community-owned docu-

ment sets forth the University‘s 
values and expectations for resolv-
ing conflicts and is intended to 
maintain a campus climate that 
supports learning for all students,” 
Harper wrote. “Similar to policies 
articulating standards for academ-
ic behavior within the University’s 
colleges and schools, the State-
ment sets forth the expectations 
for non-academic behavior for all 
students.”

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the timeline for 
amendment years is set by the Stu-
dent Relations Advisory Commit-
tee, a committee of the faculty’s 
central governing body, the Stu-
dent Advisory Committee on Uni-

versity Affairs.

“The SRAC committee sets the 

timeline — my recollection is that 
it has roughly been every three 
years,” Fitzgerald said. “I think it 
could be more frequently if there’s 
a reason.”

According to the Office of Stu-

dent Conflict Resolution’s website, 
the last statement amendment 
cycle happened during the 2012-
2013 academic year. At this time, 
five changes were made.

During the last review cycle, the 

statement was amended to reflect 
the current titles for Central Stu-
dent Government and Information 
Technology Services and SRAC’s 
affiliation with the Senate Assem-
bly — a governing body comprised 
of 74 elected faculty members from 
the University’s Ann Arbor, Flint 
and Dearborn campuses.

In 
addition, 
bullying 
was 

included as a statement violation, 
the University’s Student Sexual 
Misconduct Policy was recon-
ciled with the statement and the 
Respect for Medical Amnesty 
was added as a related procedure. 
Respect for Medical Amnesty is a 
state law that seeks to remove bar-
riers for minors voluntarily seek-
ing medical help for themselves or 
another after drinking.

Fitzgerald said he’s not yet 

aware of what specific amend-
ments might be proposed for the 
coming year.

“I’m not aware of any deep plans 

for amendments that people have 
in the works at this point,” he said. 
“As you can see it’s quite a thor-
ough and long process so there’s 
plenty of time for people to con-

Event explores 
identity, raises 

scholarship funds

By ALYSSA BRANDON

Daily Staff Reporter

Despite a delay due to severe 

weather, 
several 
University 

students took the stage in the 
University’s Museum of Art 
auditorium Thursday night to 
perform songs, dance and spo-
ken word.

Hosted by PILOT — an orga-

nization dedicated to increas-
ing awareness of identity and 
providing 
opportunities 
for 

minority students on campus 
— “Denied Voices: The Launch” 
featured 10 performances relat-
ed to identity and acceptance.

The event was originally 

located in the Museum of Art 
lobby, but due to a tornado 
warning just as the show was 

about to begin, attendees and 
performers relocated to the 
museum’s 
basement 
audito-

rium.

Among the student per-

formers were LSA junior Dana 
Mosa-Basha, who performed 
“Hallelujah” by Jeff Buckley, 
and LSA freshman JuJuan Grif-
fin, who performed an original 
rap piece titled “Statistic.”

LSA 
freshman 
Emily 

Kaufman also performed sever-
al poems discussing her experi-
ences as a transgender woman.

“Becoming the woman I 

was meant to be is the only 
way that I could live my life as 
me,” Kaufman said in one of 
her poems. “All I want is to be 
my truest self, and I’m not doing 
this for anybody else. This is for 
me and me alone.”

Along with the performances, 

the event was also the start of 
fundraising toward the Denied 
Voices Scholarship, which will 
be awarded every year to mem-

bers of marginalized communi-
ties on campus.

During the show, PILOT 

announced Josue Hervert as 
this year’s scholarship recipient. 
Hervert is currently a student at 
Wayne County Community Col-
lege and hopes to transfer to the 
University in the future.

LSA senior Swati Sudarsan, 

a member of PILOT, was one 
of the organizers of the event. 
In an interview with after the 
program, Sudarsan said talking 
about identity and acceptance is 
important in raising awareness 
about the diverse identities on 
campus.

“We live in a world where 

only the most privileged identi-
ties are heard, so there’s always 
a dominant narrative,” she said. 
“Creating a platform and space 
where these voices can be heard 
creates an atmosphere where we 
can start learning about them 
and raising awareness about

In honor of Sexual Assault 

Awareness Month, several local 
and national officials involved in 
sexual 
misconduct 
prevention 

on college campuses, including 
University officials, discussed the 
issue in a conference call Thursday 
morning.

Later in the day, along with a 

screening of the documentary film 
“The Hunting Ground” on campus, 
a second panel of University 
officials joined individuals involved 
in the film to consider the topic.

The call featured Kirby Dick 

and Amy Ziering, “The Hunting 
Ground” 
film’s 
producer 
and 

director, respectively. From the 
University, Holly Rider-Milkovich, 
director of the Sexual Assault 
Prevention 
and

With Buenos Aires 

team, ‘U’ shows 
DNA in brain 
controls obesity

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

New research conducted by a 

University team in tandem with 
the University of Buenos Aires 
has revealed the influence certain 
segments of DNA in the brain have 
on the regulation of appetite and 
weight, in addition to influencing 
obesity.

According to a University press 

release, this study is the first to 
document exactly how a brain cell 
gene is involved in weight regulation 
functions.

The team was led by Malcolm 

Low, professor of molecular and 
integrative physiology, and Marcelo 
Rubinstein, professor of physiology 
and biology at the University of 
Buenos Aires.

The research focused on genetic 

triggers inside a specific type 
of neuron in the brain called a 
proopiomelanocortin, or POMC, 
located 
in 
the 
hypothalamus. 

Previous studies of the role of POMC 
neurons in regulating sensations like 
fullness or hunger have shown that 
neurons without POMC can cause 
obesity in both animals and humans.

However, according to the new 

research, obesity can also result 

when certain genetic triggers are 
missing from the POMC neurons — 
even if the neurons themselves are 
present. Low and Rubinstein’s study 
focused on these triggers and their 
impacts on regulating weight.

The study identified the genetic 

triggers as enhancers named nPE1 
and nPE2, which are attached to 
a transcription factor called Islet 1 
that is then attached to the POMC 
neuron.

Low 
said 
enhancers 
help 

distinguish different cells in the 
body from each other.

“Every cell in the body has 

the same DNA, but they’re all 
very different. And the way that 
comes about is the little DNA 
sequences 
called 
enhancers,” 

Low said. “They’re responsible 
for determining the expressions 
of genes in certain cells. The ones 
we’ve discovered are very specific 
for turning on this POMC gene.”

The study was conducted on mice 

in two parts and published in two 
separate papers. Low said in the first 
paper, published in Proceedings of 
the National Academy of Sciences, 
they removed the enhancers nPE1 
and nPE2 in the mice. In the second 
paper, published in PLoS Genetics, 
they removed only the transcription 
factor, Islet 1. Both times, mice 
became obese.

Low said the findings showed 

that nPE1 and nPE2, as well as 
Islet 1, are necessary for a fully 
functioning POMC gene and the 
healthy regulation of weight and 
appetite.

“The transcription factor is a 

protein and it recognizes the letters 
of the DNA sequence and binds to 
it very specifically,” he said. “The 
one factor can bind to both of the 
enhancers. So they probably act as 
a unit when all of them are bound.”

Though the study was not 

conducted on humans, Low said he 
was confident there is a significant 
link to human obesity. He noted that 
scientists already know that when 
children have mutated POMC genes 
they can become dangerously obese, 
which suggests that the likelihood 
of specifically enhancer mutations 
causing similar issues is high.

“We have every reason to believe 

that would be true because we’ve 
compared the sequence of these 
enhancers 
and 
they’re 
almost 

identical in every mammal,” Low 
said.

In 
an 
e-mail 
interview, 

Rubinstein wrote that he also 
believes the translation to humans 
is quite probable due to the similar 
location and roles POMC neurons 
play in mice and humans.

“Mice 
born 
without 
the 

enhancers nPE1 and nPE2 are 
genetically programmed to have an 
impaired satiety circuit and will be 
hyperphagic and obese,” Rubinstein 
wrote. “Since these systems are 
extremely conserved at the genetic, 
anatomical and physiological level it 
is highly likely that humans without 
these enhancers will have the same 
phenotype as mice do.”

First-year 
Medical 
student 

Stephan Diljak, president of the 
University’s chapter of the American 
Medical Student Association, said 
he believes study was important 
because it has the potential to lead 
to a drug that could help people deal 
with obesity.

Additionally, both Low and Diljak 

spoke to the importance of this 
study in proving that though fitness 
and healthy eating are key factors in 
maintaining a healthy weight, genes 
do also play a crucial role in the 
obesity problem facing many people.

Diljak said the study has the 

power 
to 
disprove 
common 

misunderstandings 
people 
have 

about obesity and its causes, as well 
as the methods used to combat it.

“When a lot of people think 

about obesity, they think about 
eating associated with this — stuff 
like McDonald’s — basically not 
exercising and not doing anything 

University researchers find link 
between neurons and weight

to only be available to the elite, 
and now about 65 percent of all 
high school graduates enroll in 
college. Lectures consisted of 
sage professors soliloquizing to a 
group of rapt and silent students. 
But now we know that the best 
kind of learning is interactive and 

loud.”

LaVaque-Manty 
said 
the 

Multidisciplinary 
Design 

Program, housed in the College 
of Engineering, allows students of 
all disciplines to engage with the 
topic. He said this effort allows 
anyone interested in questioning 
the 
purpose 
of 
college 
or 

wanting to shape the future of 
the institution, regardless of a 
student’s academic pursuits.

“It gives the students an 

opportunity 
to 
understand 

better their own experience at 
Michigan,” 
LaVaque-Manty 

said. “They learn what’s unique 
about Michigan, what is not 
unique about Michigan, what 
the challenges facing higher 
education are and what kinds of 
strategies there might be to deal 
with them.”

The course began with a focus 

on the history of the University, 
as well as some common ideas 
about where it might be heading. 
The class later moved into a 
discussion about aspects of the 
college 
experience 
students 

were interested in examining or 
modifying.

Students chose to work on 

projects ranging from increasing 
engaged learning on campus to 
alumni engagement.

LSA 
sophomore 
Lauren 

Shepard 
said 
the 
class 
has 

allowed her to develop concrete 
suggestions 
to 
improve 
the 

undergraduate experience at the 
University.

“I have gotten to critically 

examine 
the 
credit 
system, 

the physical spaces in which 
students learn, and the way that 
the courses are actually taught,” 
Shepard said. “I think that the 
class teaches you to think about 
higher education in a completely 
different light.”

LaVaque-Manty 
said 
the 

purpose of the class is to allow 
students 
to 
think 
critically 

about both current education 
system and their own academic 
experiences.

“Part of our goal in the course 

is to think about the academic 
infrastructure of the University — 
the credit hour economy, grades, 
majors, 
disciplines, 
degrees,” 

LaVaque-Manty said. “Do they 
make sense? Do they still make 
sense?”

LSA junior Eni Kruja, who is 

currently enrolled in the class, 
said she believes the course is 
especially important because of 
its student-centered approach.

“We, the students, are not just 

given a syllabus, the required 
tasks for passing, and period 
instructions — we work with the 
professors to decide the direction 
of the class based on what we 
recognize as our needs for success 
and what the professors see as 
important resources for us to 
use,” Kruja said.

and nationally to discuss the issue 
of sexual assault on campuses in 
conjunction with a screening of 
“The Hunting Ground” on campus.

The documentary follows two 

survivors of sexual assault at the 
University 
of 
North 
Carolina 

through their process of reporting 
their assaults.

“ ‘The Hunting Ground’ is a very 

powerful film, it has an incredible 
message, but we want people to also 
know that they can connect with 
organizations, like the national 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center and the It’s On 
Us campaign, to be involved in a 
part of a larger movement to create 
change,” Palumbo said.

During the call, Ziering said 

the issue of sexual misconduct on 
campus can sometimes become 
convoluted due to misperceptions 
of how many reports are false. She 
said only 4 to 8 percent of reports 
are not true.

“It’s not as complicated or gray 

or hard to figure out what exactly 
went on as the culture or public 
perception would have you believe,” 
she said.

The 
University 
is 
currently 

under investigation by the U.S. 
Department of Education over its 
handling of sexual misconduct.

Dick said campus leaders have 

the ability to make the issue of 
sexual misconduct on campus a top 
priority.

“I would like to see, since it is 

Sexual Assault Awareness Month, 
college presidents present at the 
number of activities going on, and 
speaking very forcefully about 
how important this is, to them 
personally, but also how important 
it is for all the students,” Dick said.

Palumbo echoed his sentiment, 

stressing 
the 
role 
university 

administrations play in setting the 
tone for a community-wide effort to 
prevent campus misconduct.

“College campus administrators 

have the responsibility and ability 
to really set the tone for prevention 

on campus,” she said. “When they 
show institutional commitment, it 
reflects good leadership, it sets the 
tone for all of the accountability 
measures on campus, and sends a 
message of the significance of the 
campus’ sexual assault prevention 
and response effort.”

Rider-Milkovich 
said 
the 

University’s priority is promoting 
verbal, 
sober 
and 
enthusiastic 

consent before having sex.

She 
added 
that 
though 

the 
conversations 
regarding 

enthusiastic 
consent 
may 
be 

awkward at first, the University 
is 
committed 
to 
shifting 
the 

culture around consent through 
programs such as AlcoholEdu and 
Relationship Remix.

“I think it’s really valuable that 

these 
programs 
are 
providing 

the evidence that students can 
understand why it’s so critical, 
and have good role models on how 
to have those conversations, how 
proactive sober consent doesn’t have 
to be awkward or uncomfortable. 
It can be a natural part of that 
relationship’s 
progression,” 

Winchell-Caldwell said.

A 
Michigan 
Daily 
report 

published Wednesday pointed to 
discrepancies between the definition 
of consent taught to students by 
SAPAC and the definition applied 
in University disciplinary processes. 
While SAPAC says silence and body 
language do not satisfy consent, the 
University’s 
Sexual 
Misconduct 

Policy defines consent as “Clear and 
unambiguous agreement, expressed 
in mutually understandable words 
or actions, to engage in a particular 
activity.”

“I am very excited that ‘The 

Hunting Ground’ is coming to the 
University of Michigan, that we 
are a campus and community that 
is not fearful of having difficult 
conversations,” 
Rider-Milkovich 

said. “I think it is important to have 
difficult conversations in order for 
us to really get to the heart of this 
issue.”

Ruza said as a student she 

appreciated the efforts of those 
working in administration and on a 
national level who devote their time 

to making a culture shift around the 
topic of college sexual misconduct.

“For me as a student, it was really 

great to hear the perspectives of the 
folks who created ‘The Hunting 
Ground,’ as well as the other experts on 
the panel who do this work every day.”

The screening of “The Hunting 

Ground” at Rackham Amphitheatre 
Thursday night also featured a 
panel discussion with Milkovich, 
Annie Clark and Andrea Pino, the 
main subjects of the film, Paul 
Blavin, a ‘96 University alum and 
executive producer of the film, 
Margie Pillsbury, a Department of 
Public Safety and Security officer 
and head of the new Special Victims 
Unit, and Anna Forringer-Beal, 
networking, publicity and activism 
program co-coordinator of SAPAC.

The 
event 
attracted 
many 

students, faculty members and 
parents, with the amphitheatre 
completely full and people sitting in 
the aisles.

Clark told the crowd that at the 

end of the day, decisive steps have to 
be taken in response to the issue of 
sexual assault on college campuses.

“Even though some schools have 

really great policies, they still have 
zero expulsions, and I think until 
we start changing that number 
— until we have higher numbers 
of reporters, higher numbers of 
students 
actually 
being 
found 

responsible — it’s going to be very 
hard for us to change this problem” 
she said.

Pillsbury said she was hopeful 

that reporting would increase now 
that the SVU — a unit with officers 
trained to investigate crimes such as 
sexual assault and domestic abuse 
— is in place.

“Many times we don’t end up 

getting the justice (the survivors) 
want, but I really applaud their 
courage, and we do everything we 
can to show them that we believe 
them, and what their options are 
moving forward in the justice 
system,” she said. “I’m excited about 
the new SVU and hoping that the 
University will begin to make more 
reports to the police department.”

about 
it,” 
Diljak 
said. 
“Diet 

and exercise are really, really 
important, but they aren’t cures for 
everyone.”

Low said he believes scientific 

advances such as this one have 

helped transform the field of weight 
regulation in past years, removing 
common misconceptions about 
weight such as the idea that 
obesity is caused by a lack of self-
control.

“We think now that the 

propensity to become overweight 
is partly in our genes and is 
certainly exacerbated by the 

availability of cheap calories and 
reduced exercise,” he said. “So 
it’s a combination of many things, 
but we know the genetic part is 
there and we also know that these 
POMC neurons are just one part 
of a very complicated system in 
the brain.”

AWARENESS

student’s experience with sexual 
misconduct. In some sections, the 
survey asks for detailed accounts 
of one’s experience if they had been 
assaulted, and suggests scenarios 
that could have happened. If the 
respondent answers affirmativly, 
the survey then asks questions 
regarding how many times the 
assault occurred and of what 
relation the perpetrator was to the 
respondent. The survey also asks 
about drug and alcohol use during 
the time of possible instances of 
sexual misconduct.

A FAQ regarding the survey 

written by the University’s Office of 
Public Affairs says the survey asked 
about sensitive topics to foster a 
safe environment.

“It is only by directly collecting 

this information from students 
will we be able to prevent negative 
experiences 
and 
effectively 

respond when they do happen,” the 
FAQ says.

The survey begins with a 

disclaimer that reads, “Some of 
the language used in this survey is 
explicit and some people may find 
it uncomfortable, but it is important 
that we ask the questions in this 
way so that you are clear what we 
mean. Information on how to get 
help, if you need it, appears on the 
bottom of each page and at the end 
of the survey.”

However, Diaz believes the 

trigger warning included in the 
survey was not enough, and 
said the survey data is skewed 
and ineffective when it cannot 
include the voice and experiences 
of survivors who may not feel 
comfortable taking the survey.

“I think it is bringing a huge 

divide among administration and 
survivors, because it is blatantly 
disrespectful and very triggering to 
us,” she said.

In 
a 
statement, 
University 

spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said 
national experts on the topic of 
campus sexual assault, as well 
as experts in survey design and 
methodology, helped craft AAU 
survey questions

“Some of the language used in 

the AAU survey is explicit and some 
may find it uncomfortable, but it is 
important that the questions are 
posed in this way so that students 
are clear about the meaning, and 
to collect the best possible data,” he 
wrote in a statement.

Fitzgerald stated the University 

had no input in the exact language 
the survey used, yet chose to 
administer the survey to gather 

data to promote a “healthy, safe and 
non discriminatory” environment. 
He also stated each page contains 
support resources and information 
to get help.

LSA senior Hannah Crisler, 

director of the I Will campaign, 
said she also felt uncomfortable 
with the questions. Crisler said 
the graphic content and explicit 
descriptions were unwarranted 
without appropriate warning.

She particularly felt by titling the 

survey one on “campus climate,” 
as she said it made the survey 
ambiguous and did not provide 
an adequate representation to the 
survey takers.

“I think that if someone is going 

to take that survey, it’s definitely 
triggering,” she said. “If something 
did happen to you and you are 
truthfully answering the survey, 
then you are reopening a wound 
that was not explicitly chosen 
before hand.”

Crisler said she began to take the 

survey, but stopped due to anxiety.

LSA junior Connie Gao, president 

for the University’s Students for 
Choice chapter, said she disliked 
the experience of taking the survey 
as well.

Gao said she felt specifically 

asking about each separate instance 
of an individual’s experience with 
sexual assault is not necessarily 
addressing campus climate.

“There could have been ways 

to administer the survey that did 
more adequately address campus 
climate,” she said.

LSA junior Anna Forringer-Beal, 

SAPAC 
student 
co-coordinator, 

said she understands how students 
would feel triggered by the explicit 
questions, but said she believes 
the survey is an important step in 
gathering data on the issue. She said 
the explicit language was necessary 
to get the most precise information.

“It’s difficult for me, speaking 

individually, because I always 
want to put the survivor first, but 
I know as somebody who does 
social science research, a lot of 
people won’t listen to you unless 
you have the numbers to back it up,” 
Forringer-Beal said.

However, she said she would 

have liked to see the trigger 
warning made more clear and 
explicit before the survey.

Diaz echoed Forringer-Beal’s 

sentiment, saying she believed the 
University was right to seek out 
ways to gather more information 
on campus sexual assault, though 
she did not like how the survey 
was potentially inaccessible to 
survivors.

“I think it raises awareness of 

some sort, and then it also says that 
the University is taking it seriously, 
but I think it’s all very surface 
level,” she said.

sider amendments.”

In Harper’s e-mail, she wrote 

that opportunities for commu-
nity input will be available from 
April 2015 until Nov. 2, 2015. The 
SRAC must receive all of the final-
ized amendment proposals by the 
end of this period. The committee 
will then conduct a formal review 
from November 2015 through 
January 2016.

The Office of Student Conflict 

Resolution held the first commu-
nity dialogue on the statement on 
Thursday in collaboration with 
Central Student Government and 
Trotter Multicultural Center.

Though the event was open to 

all students, only current Business 
graduate student Michael Proppe, 

former CSG president, attended 
the event. Clyde Barnett III, CSG’s 
program manager and adviser, 
also attended the dialogue, along 
with OSCR personnel.

Shana Schoem, the program 

specialist at OSCR, and Stacy 
Vander Velde, the associate direc-
tor at OSCR, led the discussion.

OSCR plans to hold more com-

munity dialogues in September.

“There are definitely things 

that we’ve heard already, but we 
haven’t had the chance to hear 
too much from students,” Schoem 
said. “Hopefully, that’s what (the 
dialogues) are for and we’ll see 
more people in the fall.”

Before the SRAC forwards 

their amendment recommenda-
tions to the Office of the President 
in March 2016, the Office of the 
Vice President and General Coun-
sel and the Civil Liberties Board 

will also review the proposals.

Final 
decisions 
will 
be 

announced in April 2016 and will 
go into effect on July 1, 2016.

Harper noted in her e-mail that 

CSG, SACUA and the University’s 
administration are the three bod-
ies that can propose amendments.

Fitzgerald said granting these 

three groups the chance to amend 
the statement ensures that faculty, 
students and staff are all repre-
sented throughout the process.

“Typically CSG would have 

someone focused or some group 
focused at looking at the state-
ment,” he said. “But then I think 
it’s important to note that there 
are vehicles for faculty, staff 
and students to initiate possible 
amendments.”

these different identities.”

Overall, Sudarsan said she 

hopes the performers impact-
ed students with their perfor-
mances and stories.

“Using art is one of those 

most salient ways for people to 
express themselves and be true 

to themselves,” she said. “We 
wanted people to take away 
the motion and the pain that 
the performers have with these 
different identities and the joys 
too.”

College officials in attendance 

highlighted 
several 
programs 

at their institutions focused on 
affordability. Curt Gielow, chief 
campus executive of Concordia 
University in Ann Arbor, talked 
about a new program called the 
Concordia Promise.

The 
Promise 
allows 
high 

school juniors and seniors at cer-
tain Lutheran and Christian high 
schools to take 30 college credits 
from Concordia at $50 per credit 
hour. A typical credit usually costs 
$650, he said.

“If you do that, you’ve essen-

tially paid us $1,500, but you’ve 
earned 30 credits,” he said. “Now, 
if you then come to Concordia in 
Ann Arbor or the Concordia in 
Wisconsin that we’ve partnered 
with, we’ll give you back the 
$1,500 and move you in as a soph-
omore. You in essence have gotten 
the first year of college for free.”

Davon Shakleford, a Washt-

enaw Community College stu-
dent, said he plans to transfer to 
the University but is concerned 
with the affordability of student 
housing.

“If there is a way to make 

affordable student housing more 
accessible to students, that would 
be very helpful,” Shakleford said. 
“The housing around Ann Arbor 
is very expensive.”

Public Policy senior Bobby 

Dishell, Central Student Gov-
ernment president, agreed with 
Shakleford. He said many stu-
dents have to search for housing 
outside Ann Arbor, which makes 
them reliant on public transport 
and means they miss out on cam-
pus life.

“Students aren’t talking about 

the classes, they’re talking about 

the social aspect, being able to 
go to the games, and being part 
of that community,” he said. “It 
leaves out the students who aren’t 
able to afford the social costs at 
Michigan.”

Another issue brought up was 

the cost of books, which Eric Pen-
rose, Eastern Michigan University 
student, called extravagant.

“At some points, I’ve had to go 

to the corner of a book store and 
take a picture of the page I need-
ed just to cover what I needed to 
know because I had no money,” 
Penrose said. “That is a huge issue, 
especially since most students 
spend about $400 a semester on 
books, some even more based on 
their fields.”

LSA 
senior 
Antoinette 

Hemby, who is an out-of-state 
student, said the high cost of 
books often caused her to make 
difficult choices.

“I have the struggle of: am 

I going to buy books, or am I 
going to fly home for Thanks-
giving?” Hemby said.

Gielow said one potential 

solution is for professors to 
create their own textbooks by 
taking pieces from different 
versions and binding them for a 
cheaper price, as some Concor-
dia professors do.

Linda Blakey, vice president 

of student and academic ser-
vices at Washtenaw Community 
College, said they are also try-
ing to reduce costs through col-
laboration.

“Our library services are 

developing online educational 
resources that are free,” Blakey 
said. “They bring their materi-
als together and look at what 
they can have students use.”

Attendees also touched on 

the federal application for stu-
dent aid, FAFSA.

Margaret Rodriguez, senior 

associate director of Financial 
Aid, agreed with several other 
comments calling the FAFSA 
unnecessarily complicated and 
said there are other options 
available to assess students than 
the current, lengthy FAFSA.

“How many times do stu-

dents have to tell you that 
they’re poor?” Rodriguez said. 
“One should be plenty.”

The discussion touched on 

providing 
financial 
literacy 

opportunities to all students, 
addressing the large amount of 
pre-existing debt and alternate 
options for students who can’t 
pay their loans.

In an interview after the 

event with The Michigan Daily, 
Dingell said she hosts the round 
table meetings to become more 
engaged with the topic.

“I know higher education 

affordability is a real issue for 
young people every day,” Ding-
ell said. “It’s an issue that’s mat-
tered to me before I got elected, 
and I’m continuing with that. 
I’m meeting a lot of people who, 
for example, can’t go on to grad-
uate school, so I want to under-
stand the issues. And then, I’m 
a more effective advocate when 
I’m armed with facts.”

She added that Thursday’s 

round table in particular identi-
fied several new potential issues 
for her to look into.

“It 
raises 
awareness 
for 

everybody,” she said. “I really 
want to go through the grants, 
the Pell Grants and see what 
kind of issues they have. I’m 
going to go back and find out 
why some people are saying 
in-person loan counseling is a 
barricade. Why are they say-
ing that? What are the pros and 
what are the cons? That’s what 
I do.”

S

omething strange happened in 
my class the other day. It was 
the standard Monday start to 

my first-year semi-
nar, with our pro-
fessor asking us 
about our weekend 
and then proceed-
ing to tell us a little 
bit about her own. 
There was a faint 
buzz 
of 
talking 

around our round 
table until the pro-
fessor announced 
that she was plan-
ning on getting rid of her fridge. For 
the first time all semester, our class 
was completely silent. We were in 
shock. Our professor, a seemingly 
sane woman, was getting rid of her 
fridge? Her explanation of being more 
sustainable, conserving energy and 
being forced to eat fresh local foods 
— because frozen foods are entirely 
pointless without their partner in 
crime — fell on deaf ears. Even I was 
horrified, and I have been writing this 
column all semester hoping for people 
to make changes like that.

We were not whipped into a state of 

complete frenzy because of some deep 
emotional connection to the fridges 
in our lives. It also wasn’t because we 
are against sustainable actions — my 
first-year seminar is about psychology 
and the environment! We have spent 

the entire semester talking about steps 
toward being more sustainable. And 
yet, when our professor suggested 
making a tangible, sustainable change, 
we acted like she told us she was plan-
ning on selling her oldest daughter 
into slavery.

So, why did we act this way? Why do 

people act this way all the time when 
anything seems new or different? I 
think it’s because somewhere deep 
inside of us, we are afraid of change. 
We cling to the status quo like it will 
save us from all the world’s problems, 
even when we know it won’t. And even 
when we know there are changes that 
we can make to live a more sustain-
able, eco-friendly life, we don’t always 
take them.

I know I am a huge culprit of this 

— and I always wonder why. Why 
do I leave my computer on all night 
even though I know it is sucking up 
ridiculous amounts of energy? Why 
don’t I tell the person at the check-
out counter that I actually don’t 
need that 1,000,000,000th plastic 
bag? Why did it take me two weeks 
to change my water bottle after I 
learned about the horrors of plastic 
(don’t get me started)?

Somehow, the Monday Fridge 

Debacle gave me an answer. People 
just don’t like change, even if that 
change will be positive and help us 
and the world. It is very difficult to 
step out of the deeply grooved path 

we cut for ourselves day in and day 
out. We tried to convince her to keep 
her fridge. “What about milk?!” we 
cried. “What about leftovers! What 
about ice cream!”

And even though our professor had 

explanations and answers for each 
and every one of our concerns — she 
assured us that adults don’t need milk, 
she would make smaller portions and 
she would walk to the ice cream shop 
— we still just couldn’t deal with the 
idea of not having a fridge. There are 
certain staples in our lives, like fridges, 
that we have intense connections to 
because of the sense of normalcy they 
add to our lives.

But maybe it is time for a new nor-

mal. If we push past our natural resis-
tance to change and take a step into the 
unknown, what was once deeply alien 
and horrifying will eventually become 
the thing we resist to change. I mean, 
I’m sure the first person that came 
up with the idea for a fridge came up 
against a mountain of opposition.

All change is opposed at first, and 

yet all change eventually does happen. 
So if you hear a new idea, after allow-
ing an acceptable amount of resistance 
and freak out time — for my seminar it 
was about 10 minutes — try to see how 
that change could fit into your life or 
even make your life better.

U

ntil this week, I had heard UMix dis-
cussed on campus probably twice. The 
first was from a member of Res Staff 

advertising the University’s 
program for substance-free 
Friday night fun to me and my 
freshmen peers. The second 
was from some friends who 
went in search of free food, 
only to find it had all been 
eaten up before they arrived.

This week, UMix was cata-

pulted out of arguable irrel-
evance and into the national 
media spotlight after becom-
ing central to a controversy 
that attracted national attention. I’m fairly confi-
dent that an alcohol-free college party has never 
generated so much buzz.

It all started with a group of about 200 stu-

dents, who signed a letter saying that “Ameri-
can Sniper,” scheduled to be shown at the event, 
promotes damaging stereotypes about Middle 
Eastern and North African students. The Center 
for Campus Involvement — which hosts UMix — 
responded by cancelling the screening, and justi-
fied their decision in a Facebook statement that 
said, “Student reactions have clearly articulated 
that this is neither the venue nor the time to show 
this movie.” They also planned to hold a separate 
event to view and discuss the film.

The decision generated uproar from campus 

conservatives — and one particularly pissed-off 
Fox News pundit — who felt the decision lim-
ited students’ ability to freely discuss the topics 
portrayed in the film. They filed an ultimately-
successful counter-petition to reschedule the 
UMix showing.

I’m going to preface the rest of my column 

by saying that I firmly believe that Chris Kyle, 
the decorated Navy SEAL central to the film, is 
a hero. His work — both as a soldier fighting for 
the United States and as a philanthropist com-
mitted to helping veterans readjust to life after 
the war — was selfless, praiseworthy and brave. 
But I have never seen “American Sniper,” and this 
column is not about the film’s portrayal of Kyle or 
any cultural group.

It’s about the endemic debate about free 

speech on campus.

The debate intensified when the school failed 

to sanction a department head for writing a col-
umn stating that she hated Republicans. Some of 
the same students who called for the professor’s 
removal for this discriminatory speech later took 
to Twitter, Facebook, the blogosphere and of 
course, Fox News, to claim that the University’s 
Inclusive Language Campaign — which sim-
ply encouraged students to avoid tossing about 
words like “fag” and “retard” — was a freedom of 
speech violation.

Now, those same students have drawn even 

more negative attention to the University for 
rescheduling a controversial film, labeling it a 
transgression against their freedom of thought 
and expression, and an exercise of control by the 
University “thought police.” “Warning: Liberal 
Thought Police” also appeared on a sign advertis-
ing an event hosted by the Young Americans for 
Freedom earlier this semester.

Though the “American Sniper” dispute is 

resolved, it represents a great opportunity to 
explore what “thought police” really means, how 
it applies at our school and freedom of speech 
more generally.

The idea of university “thought police” prob-

ably comes from UWM Post v. Board of Regents 
of the University of Wisconsin System, a 1991 
Federal Court case. UWM Post struck down the 

University of Wisconsin-Madison’s ban on “rac-
ist or discriminatory” speech that was directed 
at an individual and created an “intimidating, 
hostile or demeaning environment,” according 
to the case. The majority opinion noted, “the sup-
pression of speech, even where the speech’s con-
tent appears to have little value and great costs, 
amounts to governmental thought control.”

I’d have to agree.
Most of the recent free speech controver-

sies have surrounded efforts (or lack of efforts) 
by the University to discourage speech that 
lessens the discomfort that minority students 
may feel on campus. In my view, that’s a wor-
thy goal. But limiting the content of speech to 
achieve it? I think that’s a pretty bad idea — 
plus it’s illegal anyway under the UWM Post 
decision, among others.

But that’s not what the school has been doing, 

and claims that it has are unfounded. The Inclu-
sive Language Campaign comes the closest to 
the “governmental thought control” described in 
the UWM Post case. The Campaign encouraged, 
not mandated, students to use more respectful 
words, effectually attempting to influence the 
content of speech, but not control it.

But rescheduling “American Sniper?” That 

doesn’t even come close. The University didn’t 
ban the film. They simply rescheduled its show-
ing for a time and place decidedly more appropri-
ate than UMix.

UMix is the University’s big Friday night 

event to help students “interact responsibly,” 
according to the CCI website. The other activi-
ties featured alongside “American Sniper” 
include making a Build-A-Bear, playing bingo 
and decorating picture frames.

The students who petitioned the University to 

reschedule the film argued that removing it from 
UMix programming would stifle dialogue on the 
subject. I’ve never been to UMix, but I seriously 
question how much serious, thoughtful debate 
could be reasonably expected to occur at a Friday 
night arts-and-crafts party.

The University can limit when and where 

students speak — lecture would be a nightmare 
if they didn’t. But students limit each other’s 
speech far more often. Have you ever tried 
to talk politics at a party? At least one person 
probably told you to stop — or at least that has 
been my experience.

But few people would argue that constitutes 

a speech violation. In social situations, it’s just 
accepted that there’s a time and a place for heavy, 
controversial discussion … and that time or place 
isn’t a Friday night hangout.

The University has rescheduled “American 

Sniper,” and it will be shown at tonight’s UMix 
as originally scheduled. But that doesn’t mean 
we should stop discussing the issue. Foster-
ing a safe, happy educational environment for 
all students and respecting the value of free 
speech are often two conflicting aims. Deter-
mining which balance between those two 
goals will be reflected on campus is likely to 
provoke ongoing, contentious debate.

The University has made up its mind on the 

movie, but this issue was never really about the 
movie. Rather, it’s about determining the type 
of school we want to live and learn at. Hope-
fully, when this issue resurfaces, students will 
take time to define the roles they want inclu-
sivity and free speech to play in our campus 
community. It’s a decision that will take mean-
ingful, thoughtful discussion, and it’s one that 
we should make for ourselves.

More than the movie

A writer’s advice for the new generation

VICTORIA
NOBLE

R

enowned short story writer, 
novelist and essayist Cyn-
thia Ozick recently authored 

an article titled, 
“Writers 
Old 

and Young: Star-
ing 
Across 
the 

Moat” 
for 
The 

New York Times. 
Ozick’s 
piece 

itself 
embodies 

the argument she 
makes, 
dripping 

with literary ref-
erences that both 
color and convo-
lute her essay. Sifting through her 
allusions, I found myself eventually 
agreeing with her somewhat pomp-
ous, yet founded sentiments.

In a response for The New Repub-

lic, Phoebe Maltz Bovy wrote from the 
young writer perspective, “In what 
might be the most highbrow get-off-
my-lawn ever written … fiction writer 
and essayist Cynthia Ozick complains 
in The New York Times that today’s 
young writers aren’t content to wait 
their turn.” I disagree with the con-
tention that Ozick is complaining, and 
I instead read her piece as more of a 
poetic warning.

While Maltz Bovy accurately iden-

tifies that changes in infrastructure — 
namely technological and economic 
developments — have influenced the 
shift that Ozick discusses, in doing so 
she attests that Ozick’s cultural con-
tentions are moot. Ozick does fail to 
mention the role of technology and 
economic pressures, but her cultural 
perceptions are nevertheless both 
poignant and on point.

Ozick writes, “Aspiration is not the 

same as ambition. Ambition forgets 
mortality; old writers never do. Ambi-
tion wants a career; aspiration wants a 
room of one’s own. Ambition feeds on 
public attention; aspiration is impervi-
ous to crowds.” Ambition is the desire 
to be successful, powerful or famous; 

aspiration is a strong desire to achieve 
something high or great.

I clung to the idea of these char-

acterizations. Though the difference 
between the two may seem minute, 
Ozick’s implications are grand. Ambi-
tion is a desire for a type of success 
that is legitimized by the approval 
of others; aspiration is a desire to 
fulfill a personal conviction that is 
unconcerned with circulation num-
bers or page views. Young writers 
are consumed with careerism and 
 

self-advertisement, not ideas.

Ozick continues, “Old writers in 

their youth understood themselves to 
be apprentices to masters superior in 
seasoned experience, and were ready 
to wait their turn in the hierarchy of 
recognition. In their lone and hard-
ened way of sticking-to-it, they were 
unwaveringly industrious; network-
ing, the term and the scheme, was 
unknown to them.”

As to say, there are no shortcuts 

— or there shouldn’t be. Do not rub 
elbows with old writers in an attempt 
to receive a handout or leg up, but rath-
er do so in order to learn from their 
breadth of experience. There is honor 
and importance in being an appren-
tice, and it is not a step that we should 
offhandedly aspire to forego.

The world of online journalism has 

become as convoluted as Ozick’s lit-
erary references, saturated with end-
less content and information. There is 
a constant flurry to churn out “news,” 
relevance (and sometimes accuracy) 
aside. Although Ozick refrained 
from pointing fingers, the example of 
Rolling Stone’s “A Rape on Campus” 
 

supports her allegations.

Seduced by the dramatic narra-

tive and potential impact of the story, 
Rolling Stone failed to surface and 
debate problems with Sabrina Erde-
ley’s reporting and the subsequent fact 
checking, and the mistakes that were 
made were entirely avoidable. The 
Columbia University Graduate School 

of Journalism Report on Rolling Stone 
and the UVA story reads, “The maga-
zine set aside or rationalized as unnec-
essary essential practices of reporting 
that, if pursued, would likely have led 
the magazine’s editors to reconsider 
publishing Jackie’s narrative so prom-
inently, if at all. The published story 
glossed over the gaps in the maga-
zine’s reporting by using pseudonyms 
and by failing to state where impor-
tant information had come from.”

The report also outright suggests, 

“The story’s blowup comes as another 
shock to journalism’s credibility amid 
head-swiveling change in the media 
industry. The particulars of Rolling 
Stone’s failure make clear the need for 
a revitalized consensus in newsrooms 
old and new about what best journal-
istic practices entail, at an operating-
manual-level of detail.”

While Rolling Stone’s UVA article 

is only one example, it points to an 
increasingly larger trend of producing 
sensationalized journalism despite the 
potential costs. I believe Ozick might 
argue that Rolling Stone subscribed to 
the new writer ideology; they aspired 
to make waves and in doing so, sacri-
ficed integrity and disserviced to the 
survivors of sexual assault, the publi-
cation itself and the industry at large.

Ozick wrote, “In the bottomless 

force of their seeming immortality, 
young writers are mercifully lent these 
blindfolds and ear muffs, and why? To 
shield them from what old writers 
have come to know: how things turn 
out.” Ozick is not telling young writ-
ers to “get off her lawn,” she’s warn-
ing them of the consequences of this 
new media environment. New writers 
can get swept away in the idea of fast-
tracking their careers and personal 
brand, risking or even forgetting the 
fundamentals of the craft that inspired 
us to become writers in the first place.

LAUREN 
MCCARTHY

I gave up eating animals five years ago. Chick-

en, beef, fish, gelatin, lard — you name it — were 
instantly cut from my life. Admittedly, my deci-
sion to make the dietary switch had been mostly 
influenced by basic considerations of ethics at 
the time. I had been watching videos of common 
behaviors in the meat industry until I could no 
longer bear the image of mistreated animals in 
my stomach. I hadn’t fully evaluated the broader 
implications or nuances of vegetarianism when I 
made this intuitive choice.

With an impassioned meat-free month under 

my belt, I had anticipated reevaluating myself as 
a more energetic, empowered and maybe even 
progressive person. After all, I was eating an 
increasingly faddish plant-based diet, and feeling 
better seemed to follow as a given. Weeks passed, 
and as I stared down at my large nightly bowl of 
macaroni and cheese, I realized that I still felt 
heavy, and that science classes continued to flag 
my high carbon footprint, due to my near-con-
stant consumption of dairy and eggs.

Eliminating meat from my diet had only been 

the first step. I needed to branch out of my com-
fort zone, find new and healthier options and ease 
away from my reliance on non-slaughter animal 
products as major food sources. I began experi-

menting with new seeds and herbs, pumpkins and 
squashes and the seemingly endless variations of 
soy, until I had formed a well balanced diet that 
worked for my nutritional needs. Over the past 
few years, I have focused on vegetarianism as a 
powerful tool for reducing greenhouse gas emis-
sions and needless water usage, and ultimately as 
a method of achieving environmental justice.

The University offers educational programs, 

conducts research and engages in regular sus-
tainability efforts under the umbrella move-
ment Planet Blue. East Quad Residence Hall 
recently opted to participate in a specific oper-
ation, by implementing three dates of Meat-
less Mondays throughout this semester. The 
concept of Meatless Monday dates back to con-
servation efforts during World War I and has 
since transformed into an international health 
and environmental campaign.

As a current resident of East Quad, I thorough-

ly enjoyed the accomplishment and promotion 
of the two Meatless Mondays that have already 
taken place. Our dining hall had noticeably less 
traffic on these days, due to the availability of 
meat options at nearby dining halls, but staff 
enthusiastically served delicious alternatives 
for vegetarians and venturing meat-eaters alike. 

STEPHANIE TRIERWEILER | VIEWPOINT

Revamp Meatless Mondays

Breakfast on Feb. 23 featured frittata 
and French toast, and lunch and din-
ner had fried vegetable po’boy, risotto 
and portobello sliders. March 9 pro-
vided grilled cheese, pierogies, stir fry 
and black bean burgers, among other 
main courses.

I commend East Quad for its dedi-

cation to a highly varied and appetiz-
ing menu. Dishes hailing from diverse 
geographical regions were prominent-
ly featured, and food quality exceeded 
Michigan dining’s standards on both 
Meatless Mondays. Residents com-
mitted to vegetarianism or otherwise 
sustainable eating found an easier 
time navigating choices that catered to 
their lifestyles.

At the same time, I do not believe 

that the food reflected our poten-
tial to design healthy and entirely 
plant-based meals. Meatless Monday 
served many fried options, and most 
main courses involved dairy or eggs. 
Although vegetarian diets may include 
the consumption of certain animal 
products, East Quad should consider 

reducing its reliance on them as well 
as fried foods to represent the usual 
meals of vegetarians.

Plenty of healthy and tasty alter-

natives exist that don’t exclude vegan 
diets or mindful eaters. For example, 
the dining hall could reintroduce 
its oatmeal bar, offer whole-grain 
pasta instead of white and include a 
broader selection of nuts, seeds and 
fruits. It also could grill or bake items 
as opposed to frying them and offer 
hearty courses like root vegetable 
soup, avocado salads, couscous dishes 
and curried lentils.

Walking toward the dining hall 

on the first vegetarian day, students 
passed several large posters that 
prompted, “I LOVE Meatless Monday 
because … ” and “I HATE Meatless 
Monday because … ” with available 
markers for their personal input. The 
typical dining hall feedback cards had 
been removed from tables for a more 
public display of student opinions.

While I admire the availability of a 

platform for conversation, East Quad 

could take this a step further by remov-
ing the adversarial format and setting 
up spaces for dialogues about vegetari-
anism and other sustainability topics. 
Most student comments on the posters 
pointed to rational concerns on either 
end of the debate and could be expand-
ed to engage in a truly comprehensive 
discussion in the future.

East Quad has already done an 

excellent job of branching out of tra-
ditional meals, raising awareness and 
participating in a respectable cam-
paign. But I encourage my residence 
hall to foster real conversations during 
our third and final Meatless Monday 
of the semester, which takes place on 
April 13. New projects involve growing 
pains. Just as many individuals learn 
and adapt to their new lifestyles, we 
also have the capacity to present the 
most healthful versions of a vegetar-
ian diet at Michigan, and extend our 
collective comfort zone in the process.

Foster fights to save 
lackluster ‘Younger’

TV LAND

“Is that a money phone?”

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

Let me get this out of the way 

first: I am not the target audience 
for “Younger.” I am a 20-year-old 
male 
college 

student, not the 
type of person 
TV Land goes 
after 
with 
a 

show about a 
woman in her 
40s 
pretend-

ing to be, well, 
younger. How-
ever, 
there’s 

one 
element 

that 
peaked 

my interest in the series: its star, 
Sutton Foster. She has won two 
Tony Awards for her Broadway 
work (and has been nominated 
for several more), and she starred 
in the short-lived “Bunheads.” 
After four episodes, it’s clear that 
the show revels in Foster, but it 
doesn’t quite have the supporting 
material to create an interesting 
series around her.

“Younger” follows the recently-

divorced Liza Miller (Sutton), a 
40-year-old woman trying to break 
back into the publishing industry 
after taking time off to raise her 
daughter (newcomer Tessa Alb-
ertson). After being berated for her 
age in an interview, she meets Josh 
(Nico Tortorella, “Make it or Break 
It”) at a bar. Josh thinks she’s in 
her 20s, so she decides to pretend 
to be 26. When she does, she lands 
a job as an assistant to Diana Trout 
(Miriam Shor, “Hedwig and the 
Angry Inch”) the head of market-
ing of a major publisher, and she 
meets Kelsey (Hilary Duff, “Lizzie 
McGuire”), Diana’s publisher.

If “Younger” has one saving 

grace, it’s the leading lady. On 
“Bunheads” and her other Broad-
way performances, Foster proved 
her wry sense of humor, which 
she uses effectively on this show. 
She plays off of her fellow actors 
well, as it is clear she and Duff 
have genuine comedic chemistry. 
However, what makes her per-
formance strong is how, over the 
course of multiple episodes, she 
elucidates Liza’s vulnerability and 
uncertainty surrounding her work 

and relationship. She doesn’t get to 
show the range that she showed 
in “Bunheads” but she does more 
work than what’s on the page, 
making the series better as a result.

Unfotunately, the show around 

Foster isn’t nearly as strong. It 
tries to be funny, and some jokes 
work thanks to Foster (about 
Liza’s inability to use social 
media). However, the rest of the 
show’s humor comes off as lazy. 
If viewers took a shot each time 
they heard a line about lazy, enti-
tled, bratty millennials, they’d 
probably die. It’s one thing if the 
show quips about the concept a 
few times in an episode, but that 
one-note idea is the center of all 
the humor in the office. Comedies 
become boring after they berate 
the audience with punchlines 
written using a thesaurus.

If it wasn’t for Sutton Fos-

ter, “Younger” would be ter-
rible, especially for someone 
completely out of the target audi-
ence. However Foster’s genuinely 
funny and moving performance 
elevates the show from forget-
table to bearable.

I 

have never had much 
patience for masculinity. Or 
at least, not the restrictive 

and gendered version of masculin-
ity, all machismo, beer and hot 
wings, and the 
eschewal of 
any emotion 
or sincerity. 
I have been 
quoted saying 
that Captain 
Von Trapp 
from “The 
Sound of 
Music” is the 
only “manly 
man” I have 
ever loved. And even he had his 
moments of vulnerability — if 
“Edelweiss” didn’t make you go 
weak at the knees then you’re a 
lying robot.

Masculinity in pop culture 

takes on many forms. Sometimes 
it’s the central code of what we 
watch — wrestling, Bud Light 
commercials and “Two and a 
Half Men” all thrive on the idea 
of masculinity, that biological/
sociological creed that makes 
dudes dudes. But pop culture 
can also criticize masculinity. 
Sometimes 
it’s 
by 
showing 

counterpoints, like J.D. and Turk’s 
nine-season long “bromance” on 
“Scrubs,” which was sincerely 
intimate and nuanced. Sometimes 
masculinity 
— 
meaning, 
the 

negative stereotype of macho 
dude-ness — can be criticized 
by showing it at its worst, most 
manfully harmful. This is the case 
with Netflix’s “Bloodline.”

A Netflix original from Todd and 

Glenn Kessler, the masterminds 
behind the oft-overlooked but 
excellent “Damages,” “Bloodline” 
is a dark, studied tale of family 
and revenge, loyalty and lies. The 
Rayburns are a storied Southern 

family, owners of an inn on an 
island at the tip of the Florida Keys. 
Led by ukulele-playing patriarch 
Robert (Sam Shepard, “August”), 
it’s clear from episode one, scene 
one that the Rayburns are not the 
upstanding Floridians they make 
themselves out to be.

Responsible, 
dependable, 

good guy second brother John 
is the narrator and supposed 
protagonist, and he is played 
with strong-jawed consistency by 
Kyle Chandler. Through him we 
learn of his fuck-up older brother 
Danny’s return to the island — 
a return that is anything but 
prodigal. Season one examines 
the impact mysterious Danny’s 
return has on the lives of the entire 
family, slowly twisting its way 
through the tangled lies and knee-
deep resentment lying below the 
Rayburns’ chilled-out surface.

Unlike “Damages,” which was 

fueled by its two strong female 
characters, both brilliant and 
calculating 
and 
unapologetic, 

“Bloodline” is all about the men. 
Distant and formidable Robert, 
family man and island hero John, 
their volatile and boorish youngest 
brother Kevin, and Danny — sly, 
wounded and threatening.

Masculinity is the lynchpin of 

“Bloodline.” The brothers idolize 
and fear their father, whose violent 
tendencies are reflected in all three 
of them. Danny is rejected by the 
rest of the family because he failed 
in the most masculine of tests — 
protecting their sister when it 
mattered most. Conflicts, both 
real and imagined, are addressed 
with fists and baseball bats and 
“fuck you”s. And when they aren’t 
fighting they are swearing, fishing, 
drinking or fucking. These are 
men, and the overt masculinity 
would be offensive — an affront 
to the lack of similar complexity 

afforded the female characters 
— if they all weren’t so obviously 
messed up.

By the end of the intense 

season it’s clear that none of these 
characters are redeemable, their 
constant violence and bullishness 
inextricably 
tied 
to 
their 

relationship with their father, to 
their own sense of self, to their 
manhood. We aren’t supposed to 
respect them and their blustering 
strength — this masculinity is 
the hamartia of them all. In fact, 
the only likable male character, 
Meg Rayburn’s cop fiancé Marco, 
is doomed because of his very 
sensitivity — he is willing to be 
vulnerable in ways the Rayburns 
just can’t handle.

“Bloodline” is as bloody and 

clannish as its name suggests. 
There is a point in episode 13, 
when things have begun to 
unravel, that John needs to 
counsel his younger brother. He 
tells Kevin to “be a man.” The 
irony is that it’s their “manliness” 
that 
has 
gotten 
them 
into 

trouble — their hotheadedness, 
inability to compromise, fierce 
loyalty to a troubled father 
and dangerous competition as 
brothers. This is a show about 
men, about a lineage of men 
supposedly bigger and better 
than the world around them. But 
the Rayburn men are not placed 
on thrones, and their violent 
actions are not gratuitous — the 
Kesslers 
progressively 
show 

that their downfall is rooted in 
this anarchic, archaic role of 
masculinity. The truth is, if they 
all were a little more like Marco, 
the “Bloodline” Keys would be a 
much more tranquil place.

HBO film reminds 
us why the singer is 

timeless

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

“Ladies and gentlemen … Frank 

Sinatra.”

Few figures in American music 

history 
can 

claim to have 
the same hyp-
notic hold over 
the 
American 

music 
scene 

that 
Frank 

Sinatra had and 
still has. His 
crooning voice 
floats from our radios during the 
holiday season, or serves as the 
subtle, yet recognizable back-
ground music for period films; his 
music seems to possess a mysteri-
ous timelessness unattainable for 
anyone else. But Sinatra the man 
is just as intriguing as his music is 
mesmerizing, and Alex Gibney’s 
four-hour 
long 
documentary, 

“Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,” 
captures this mystique.

How do you capture the 

essence of a man larger than 
life? You never take your eyes 
off of him, according to Gibney’s 
documentary. The entire four-
hour piece consists of old foot-
age of Sinatra’s performances, 
clips from his films, photographs 
and news clippings with voice 
overs by recognizable figures 
like Bruce Springsteen or Terry 
Teachout. There’s not one piece 
of footage from the interviews 
conducted for the film, only 
audio recordings. From the first 
few seconds of a lazily seduc-
tive static record player scratch, 
to the last few notes of his daz-
zling “New York, New York” 
performance, you are completely 
immersed in Sinatra’s character, 
his voice, his charisma — there’s 
no one else to distract you.

Gibney structures the docu-

mentary by following the song 

setlist 
of 
Sinatra’s 
so-called 

retirement concert in Los Ange-
les in 1971, using each song to 
mark a new chapter in Sinatra’s 
story. It begins with a young 
teenager from Hoboken who 
loved his mother Dolly and was 
kicked out of his house by his 
father for quitting high school to 
sing. The documentary follows 
Sinatra through each pit stop on 
the way to a skyrocketing solo 
career from music to acting, pay-
ing close attention to how his life 
intersected with those of other 
icons like Elvis Presley, Martin 
Luther King, the Kennedys and 
various other presidents.

There’s nothing new about 

Sinatra that people haven’t heard 
before; what is different about 
this version of the tale is how 
well-rounded it is. Sinatra’s life is 
vivified by ample cultural back-
ground. There’s footage of people 
during The Great Depression 
and of glamorous movie stars in 
Hollywood; there are extended 
shots of other household names 
of Sinatra’s time, including Walter 
Cronkite, Elvis Presley and Mia 
Farrow. The lack of interruption 
from current faces (such as the 
experts on Sinatra) contributes 
to the documentary’s effect by 
embodying the feel of the Ameri-
can psyche during these times.

There’s no direct criticism 

or open discussion of Sinatra’s 
flaws, but it doesn’t keep up the 
untarnished romantic image of 
him either. He may have been an 
icon, but he was still very much a 
product of his time period. While 
he’s credited with changing per-
ceptions of immigrants and push-
ing for African American rights, 
there are hints that his personal 
relationships didn’t always reflect 
this gold-hearted activism.

Of course his complicated rela-

tionships with women are any-
thing but secret. “He reeked of 
sex,” according to Ava Gardner, 
the sultry film star with whom 
he conducted his first affair while 
married to his first wife Nancy. 
Few men of the time exuded sex 
appeal in the sophisticated yet 

irresistible way Sinatra did. All 
four of his tumultuous marriages 
were characterized by passion-
ate affairs and a habit of spring-
ing divorce papers on his wives, 
not to mention flirtations with 
big names in Hollywood. Despite 
his various relationship highs and 
lows — Sinatra never quite went 
out of style, even when the bobby 
soxers began screaming Presley’s 
name instead of his own. Few 
people in America have had such 
complicated relationships with 
newspaper headlines.

Some stories could have been 

cut down for the sake of time, 
such as the story of his son’s kid-
napping, which felt surprisingly 
off-topic for the amount of time 
it took. Some of the auditory 
contributions felt too measured 
and practiced, so it’s almost too 
easy to tune them out. But Gib-
ney made a smart decision when 
he chose to focus on the music. 
Each song he uses is recogniz-
able in its effect and emotion — 
the stripped down sound of “Try 
a Little Tenderness,” the evoca-
tive appeal of his rendition of 
“Ol’ Man River” or even the wry 
humor on “That’s Life.”

“Sinatra: All or Nothing at All” 

doesn’t feel like it is piecing togeth-
er or pulling apart an image of the 
legendary figure radically differ-
ent from the one most of us have 
of him. The documentary’s length 
allows it to organically retell the 
story of a complicated man, but for 
all that, it doesn’t feel like view-
ers get inside Sinatra’s head. This 
makes for a startling contrast 
with Gibney’s latest work “Going 
Clear,” an exposé on the church 
of scientology in which he delves 
into the minds of former scientolo-
gists at length. But by the end of 
this documentary, it feels like we 
aren’t supposed to be able to delve 
into Sinatra’s psyche — it doesn’t 
appear that anyone else during his 
lifetime was able to either. So we’ll 
just have to be content with the 
biographies, articles and of course, 
as the documentary reminds us, 
the timeless music. Happy belated 
100th birthday, Sinatra.

FILM REVIEW

By KEN SELANDER

Daily Arts Writer

In planning out a music video, 

there are a number of mostly 
intangible things you don’t con-
sider. For one, the importance 
of complying with the director 
is often overlooked. While you 
might have your own ideas for 
the video, it’s their job to think 
how such a shot would play out 
in editing and timing with the 
song. They usually know what’s 
best, as much as you might want 
a shot of you doing BMX bike 
tricks outside at night in bad 
weather and poor lighting. It’s 
also easy to be impatient, even 
though quality clearly takes 
time. Most notably, however, 
is how awkward it can be to 
film in places where any pass-
erby can see you recording. 
Jumping around outside in an 
attention-grabbing outfit spe-
cifically selected for the music 
video while lip-syncing to the 
track you recorded yourself on a 
loud speaker can feel a bit silly 
and uncomfortable – especially 
when passerbys are staring at a 
commotion of high quality cam-
era equipment recording some 
goofball dancing around to a 
parody song.

For my music video project, 

the 
recording 
process 
took 

place over two days, probably 
amounting 
to 
seven 
hours 

of time spent, and about a 
couple hours of footage. I’m 
lucky enough to have two 
friends, Lingene and Chris, 
with extremely high quality 
camcorders, 
stabilization 

equipment, experience behind 
the camera and an attention 
to detail that allowed for a 
video quality comparable to 
those produced by plenty of 
cinematographers hired by real 
rappers. 
They 
then 
labored 

through the editing process, 
which took about two weeks, 
with 
school 
slowing 
things 

down. The video editing process 
can be tedious and frustrating — 
a reality I learned from various 
skateboard and snowboard edits 
of friends and me that I made in 
high school for fun. After all this 
hard work, the final product was 
ready and released to the masses 
via YouTube.

The friends who have been 

kind enough to watch the paro-
dy music video we made (often 
only after my encouragement) 
all get a good laugh out of it, and 
we’re very proud of the final 
product. Soon after, I talked 
with my friend Chris about the 
music video, and told him I’d be 
sure to give him due credit for it 
whenever it was brought up. He 
responded kindly, and in con-
versation casually mentioned 
that “It’s OK. No one cares 
about the editor.” This really 
struck me, knowing how much 
work he and Lingene had put 
in behind the scenes, but then 
I thought on how this state-
ment seems to hold a lot of truth 
across the rap industry, too.

Before the Internet, most 

music videos surely saw almost 
all of their play come on media 
outlets like MTV – a funny 
thought considering the chan-
nel’s programming nowadays. 
With the explosion of the Inter-
net, it would’ve been a safe 
bet to venture that rap music 
video directors would begin to 
receive more recognition, much 
as producers have. Sadly, it’s 
simply not so.

With the natural course of 

development of the Internet, 
mixtapes can now be widely 
promoted, 
distributed 
and 

downloaded. 
Along 
with 
a 

wider audience for mixtapes, 
producers also started branding 
their productions in the form of 
shout outs and adlibs on tracks. 
Producers like Zaytoven, Mike 
Will Made It, Young Chop and 
many more have come into 
mainstream rap consciousness 
through what is essentially a 
creative promotional marketing 
technique (in addition to their 
beats, of course). Such promo-
tion is now a common practice 
and can usually only be escaped 
by listeners on actual rap 
albums which shed the repeti-
tive DJ/producer shout-outs as 
a form of quality control. Heck, 
just yesterday I was listening 
to a Young Thug mixtape pro-
duced by DJ Esco, and I can still 
hear “DJ Esco the coolest dee-
jay in the world!” in my head.

Despite all the recognition 

the 
Internet 
has 
helped 

bring to producers — and 
even 
photographers, 
in 

cases like Cam Kirk and Dan 
Folger — it doesn’t seem that 

cinematographers/directors 
have followed suit into the 
mainstream rap conscious.

There are basic reasons why 

video directors have not fol-
lowed others in rising to fame 
since the Internet has allowed 
a potential venue for newfound 
stardom. 
Obviously, 
being 

behind the camera means you 
are not in the video. The cred-
it they do get is typically only 
allowed during the intro and/
or conclusion of the video, but 
can easily be overlooked. If 
music videos were to be tagged 
with a cinematographer/editor 
watermark on screen the entire 
time, it would take away from 
the rapper around whom the 
video is focused. Even worse 
in my mind, it would be in bad 
taste. Photographers, on the 
other hand, can excuse the use 
of watermarks as a means of 
preventing copyright to vali-
date their use, simultaneously 
helping establish recognition 
for themselves.

More generally, the nature 

of music videos makes it hard-
er to be recognized as a direc-
tor. The videos contain a lot of 
stimuli – scenes are constantly 
switching up and there’s often 
tons of action. In contrast, a 
picture is still, and its analysis 
is simpler. Also, the variance in 
output probably plays a big role. 
Producers can put out plenty of 
mix-tapes featuring only their 
beats with various artists and 
at the same time have other 
beats on individual tracks, art-
ists, albums and mix-tapes. 
They can sit on beats, and wait 
to use them for a moment when 
the chemistry with a rapper is 
right. The recording and edit-
ing process for music videos is 
long and tedious, so production 
is slower for that reason. Also, 
directors cannot sit on music 
videos like producers can sit on 
beats, because it’s crucial for 
them to be released at the right 
time for maximum popularity 
and relevance.

Surely, people closer to the 

rap music industry are more 
conscious of music video direc-
tors — like “The Devil,” who 
I was first introduced to in 
Noisey Atlanta. As far as I’m 
concerned, the average con-
sumer of rap music and its 
related media isn’t aware of 
directors and probably doesn’t 
pay the topic much mind. There 
isn’t a “mixtape” for music 
videos whereby directors can 
achieve better name recogni-
tion among consumers, but I 
think something of the sort 
would be the best way for it to 
happen. Creating lower quality 
videos for lesser known artists 
probably wouldn’t do the trick, 
unless directors could actively 
and accurately search out tal-
ented up-and-comers. Perhaps 
if directors were to start mak-
ing lower budget music vid-
eos for lesser known songs by 
already famous artists they’d 
have a better chance at wider 
recognition. With quicker and 
increased production, and per-
haps the opportunity to slap 
more director branding onto 
rap music videos — because the 
artistic/musical value of non-
hits is less important than hit 
songs — directors could start 
having their names better rec-
ognized amongst mainstream 
consumers of rap music.

UMix is right idea, 

wrong place for 
controversial film

By JAMIE BIRCOLL

Senior Arts Editor

I honestly never thought 

there would be cause to write 
about “American Sniper” again. 
I never thought discussions of 
rape on campus and serious 
allegations against the Univer-
sity for failure to adequately 
help victims of rape and sex-
ual assault would be not only 
supplanted, 
but 
completely 

drowned out by movies. Mov-
ies, in the grand scheme of 
things, are not important — use-
ful, helpful, but not important. 
Human health and well-being 
are important. But the people 
have spoken.

This Friday at UMix, you 

have the option of seeing one 
of two films: “American Snip-
er” and “Paddington.” One of 
these films is entirely appropri-
ate for UMix Late Night, one is 
not. UMix is about inclusivity, 
fun, social gathering where you 
don’t worry about the political 
and social implications of, well, 
anything — these are all things 
that “American Sniper” does 
not promote. It doesn’t belong 
at some alternative to Friday 
night shenanigans; it’s a serious 
film with serious repercussions 
and truly disturbing content. It 
shouldn’t have been shown in 
the first place.

But it will be, so it’s only fair 

we discuss it.

The decision to pull the 

showing of the film was a wise 
one. As stated above, it doesn’t 
belong 
at 
UMix. 
However, 

having seen the film and having 
commented on it extensively 
already (and having discussed 
it with multiple people with 
multiple 
viewpoints), 
I 

understand the argument for 
showing the film.

I admit “American Sniper” 

is a one-sided portrayal of 
one 
white 
American 
male 

who’s tasked with the job of 
killing Muslim people, who 
are presented in an incredibly 
one-sided fashion, but that is 
not the point of the film, and 
it isn’t a verbatim recreation 
of the words Chris Kyle wrote 
in his book. This is a complex 
character with multiple motives 
and values. It’s a character 
study, not an overt attempt to 
promote American pride or 
violence. So stop associating 
“proud to be an American” 
with 
“American 
Sniper,” 

stop putting this character 
on a pedestal. Chris Kyle as 
portrayed in “American Sniper” 
is 
a 
disturbed, 
conflicted 

individual. The viewer needs to 
separate the book and the film: 
these are two different media, 
from two different writers, 
with two different goals and 
two different results.

But even if appeals to the 

artistic intent of the work 
fall on deaf ears, perhaps 
a 
call 
for 
reason 
reaches 

you. Disagreement does not 
permit censorship. If you are 
uncomfortable with the film, 
then do not see it. Your dislike 
of some media should not 
permit others from partaking, 
and your opinion about that 
media does not supersede those 
of others; you are not infallible, 
yours is not the only opinion on 
this campus.

If you are truly unsettled 

by “American Sniper,” then 
you need to open a dialogue. 
In fact, the University should 
open a dialogue by hosting a 
speaker, following the film, 
to discuss at length both sides 
of the argument (somewhere 
other than UMix). That is how 
we exchange ideas; that is how 
we 
achieve 
understanding. 

Sweeping the film under the 
rug and pretending it never 
happened accomplishes nothing 
and, in a way, proves a little 
cowardly. How do you expect to 
actually foster discussion and 
understanding if you only wish 
to shut down the conversation 
before it even begins?

Whatever your thoughts on 

“American Sniper,” it’s impor-
tant to recognize that film and 
art are meant to foster debate 
and ideas, not to succumb to 
your individual, preconceived 
notions of right and wrong. 
Director Michael Haneke said, 
“The ideal film scene should 
force the spectator to look away 
… if you want to talk about a 
problematic topic, the film itself 
should do it justice.”

That we continue to have 

this debate proves that Clint 
Eastwood did at least some-
thing right in crafting his film. 
We can spout all this rhetoric 
about sensitivity or free speech 
or tolerance, but neither side 
can rightfully claim to represent 
those tenets without shutting up 
and listening to what the other 
has to say. And in fact, the major-
ity, even more than the minority, 
has an obligation to do so.

This is one of the best and 

brightest campuses in America 
— it’s about time we, the 
students, the administration, 
the teachers, all of us, start 
acting like it.

VICTORIOUS VOICES

UnCommonly righteous.

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Music Editor

A generalization, by definition, 

is a sweeping statement or 
concept obtained by inference 
from specific cases. It is a word 
that refers to the process of using 
several personal anecdotes, or the 
collected experiences of others, to 
create an overarching statement 
or idea. The music industry holds 
a number of these abstractions. 
There’s the notion that rock 
music is dead, or that Spotify and 
Pandora are killing the industry, 
or that traditional record stores 
have virtually disappeared; the 
list is fundamentally endless. 
Enshrouded 
within 
these 

generalizations, however, is a 
kernel of truth.

Next Friday, April 17 at Hill 

Auditorium, 
when 
Antwaun 

Stanley and Brendan Asante and 
his musical collective Video 7 
take the stage to open for R&B 
and hip-hop legend Common, a 
few more generalizations will 
be left tarnished — perhaps 
even destroyed. In fact, Stan-
ley and Asante, in tandem with 
Common’s 
inevitably 
moving 

performance, will trump mul-
tiple routine assumptions of our 
apparently ill-fated music indus-
try. At a fair price and with the 
most genuine of intentions, their 
opening set won’t orbit around 
preconceived notions regarding 
stardom, money or overinflated 
levels of hype. These more mate-
rial elements are pertinent for 
heavy 
hip-hop 
performances. 

But not this concert nor it’s open-
ing set; this performance is set 
to transcend the classic form. 
Bouncing off the acoustically 
unequaled walls of Hill Auditori-
um, the music of these University 
of Michigan graduates will create 
a musical mural of hip hop, trap 
jazz and Motown, all with the 
intention of actualizing an envi-
ronment of emotion, energy and 
inspiration with their audience.

Stanley’s early introduction 

and successes in the music 
industry are almost prodigal. 
Born 
and 
raised 
in 
Flint, 

Michigan, it was at the age of 
three 
that 
Stanley’s 
mother 

noticed his impeccable capacity 
to carry and create a tune.

“The story goes that I was in 

the kitchen with my mom, sitting 
at a little kids table with its per-
fectly yellow chairs, and while 
she was cooking she was hum-
ming ‘Amazing Grace.’ She slowly 
stopped and noticed me sitting 
there and that all the while she 
was singing, I had started to hum 
along and create my own version 
of the song.”

From then on it was only a mere 

matter of time before the word of 
this incident and Stanley’s irre-
futable skill was disseminated 
through the local neighborhoods 
and community. The infatua-
tion for the young Stanley and 
his incredible skill moved from 
local to larger followings. Sony 
and Dreamworks signed Stanley 
before he eventually transferred 
to a Michigan record label.

“I had a wonderful manage-

ment team and eventually, so 
many years later, I was led to an 
independent label titled Bajada 
Records in Detroit,” Stanley 
humbly explained.

With Bajada Records, Stanley 

released his first independent 
gospel project, I Can Do Any-

thing, for which he was nomi-
nated as “Best New Artist” and 
“Best Music Video” in the 2008 
Stellar Awards, gospel music’s 
highest honor. Simultaneous to 
those successes, Stanley was a 
student here at the University 
pursuing a degree in Sociology 
and Music. His scholarly under-
takings remained imperative, but 
Stanley’s artistry never strayed 
from his collegiate mural. Groove 
Spoon was a college funk band 
that Stanley and other musically-
inclined students formed during 
their time. The group experi-
enced great levels of appreciation 
and success across campus, from 
house parties to the coveted slot 
as openers to President Barack 
Obama’s 2012 commencement 
speech. After college, Stanley’s 
talent threaded itself into numer-
ous other musical endeavors, 
expanding to contemporary funk 
and soul bands like Ann Street 
Soul and Vulfpeck.

“I’m interested in anything 

that feeds your soul. And that 
could be jazz, that could be 
hip hop or that could be gospel 
music,” Stanley elaborated. “I 
find myself stepping back and 
saying, ‘What kind of creativity 
do I have today?’ and that could 
mean anything. Maybe that’ll 
mean I’ll try a little jazz or a little 
pop or country. However it comes 
out. It’s good to broaden your 
mind because, when you do, you 
are able to collaborate with folks 
who have a completely different 
background musically. And that 
could at times have you produc-
ing something that would have 
maybe never come to life.”

Once the inspiration is found, 

Stanley flourishes. By entering 
every musical experience and 
performance as an excavator 
of inspiration, the structure of 
genres and the music industry as 
a whole is belittled, and maybe 
even diminished. This ability to 
instantly broaden his talents in 
the name of creativity has manu-
factured a musical chameleon 
with a particular zest for live per-
formances.

“Any time I go to a live show 

I leave with something — a 
piece of you is taken. You leave 
uplifted or empowered or ready 
to make a change. With live per-
formances, and this one in par-
ticular, we’re creating a theme 
of trying to see things in a bet-
ter light – I think that is this 
concert and it’s mindset, all still 
under the umbrella of hip hop,” 
he said.

The music and voices of 

the opening performance will 
surely do just that. Entering 
with their own genres and 
creations, next Friday’s stage is 
set to be ensconced with various 
musicians, 
instruments, 
and 

even one beloved Robert Hurst 
when Stanley and Brendan 
Asante’s Detroit based musical 
collective, Video 7 envelope the 
auditorium.

Brendan Asante, an Auburn 

Hills native of Ghanian descent, 
is a more recent graduate of the 
University who aided in the 
creation of the Video 7 collec-
tive here on campus over the 
past two years. Operating under 
the axiom ‘we don’t see genre, 
we just hear sound,’ Video 7 and 
Asante don’t want their artistry 
to just be seen or heard, they 
want it to be felt. Under numer-
ous artistic mediums like film, 

music and even app design, the 
collective has begun to expand 
into a collaborative force of 
musicians focusing on the feel-
ings associated with the experi-
ence of receiving music.

It’s easy to argue that this 

goal, the desire to make their 
music noticed and effective, is 
a high stakes mission. They’re 
asking for more than just placid 
consumption, they are looking 
to make an individual feel some-
thing, whatever that may be. 
That is a difficult task, surely, 
but when a group incorporates a 
harp surrounded by synthesiz-
ers in their live performances, 
instilling and inciting emotion 
doesn’t appear as burdensome.

“Whether it be music, film, 

app design, whatever, we’re 
trying to be innovative and 
turning all of it into an overall 
experience,” explained Asante. 
“Instead of being just automati-
cally processed because ‘soci-
ety’ can already make you like 
that. Video 7 is doing things 
that, well we are just trying to 
rewire the brain patterns a bit 
and soak up just as much as we 
can because it all feels new.”

Stanley and Video 7’s perfor-

mance can’t be categorized or 
predicted. Drawing on influenc-
es from the music anthologies of 
J Dilla, Detroit’s Motown music 
and modern hip hop, the set 
will be defined by the audience. 
They’ll bounce from the presen-
tation of classics and modern 
pieces, then into a more experi-
ential set where, upon the audi-
ence’s request, any song, sample 
or beat that the onstage band 
presents can be instantly trans-
formed with Video 7’s beats, 
their pre-recorded tracks, or by 
the very musicians onstage.

“J Dilla was an expert at 

inserting a groove into what-
ever he did. Whether it was his 
beats or his music, the groove 
was always infectious and got 
your head knocking. In this 
same form we’re going to be 
using the foundation of all the 
original beats but then tak-
ing those classics and pulling 
the rug out from under them,” 
Asante said.

Generalizations derail and 

distract. They are powerful, so 
potent, in fact, that they can 
misinform any ductile audience. 
But buried within each, embed-
ded in some nook or cranny of 
the idea, lies some semblance of 
truth. There’s the issue of the 
ever-powerful genre, for exam-
ple, and our society’s desire to 
categorize and define all music. 
Or the notion that most, if not 
all, live music performances 
need a certain level of hype or 
stardom in order to be truly 
effective. Surely both are true 
in some concert landscapes. 
But next weekend a jack-of-all-
trades talent who bypasses the 
structure of the genre to find 
the inspiration, Stanley, is set 
to collaborate with an amalga-
mation of artistry focused on 
innovation within the musical 
experience, 
Brendan 
Asante 

and his Video 7 music collec-
tive. Before hip-hop legend 
Common engulfs Hill Audito-
rium on April 17, one of gospel 
music’s chameleon talents and 
Asante’s assemblage of millen-
nial talents will crawl through 
and melodiously destroy the 
generalizations.

MUSIC INTERVIEW

With the Michigan baseball 

team’s seven wins in its last eight 
games — including series victo-
ries over No. 18 Maryland and 
Indiana — it 
may be tempt-
ing 
to 
start 

looking ahead 
to events like 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament 
and a possible 
NCAA Tourna-
ment berth.

But as Mich-

igan coach Erik 
Bakich routine-
ly points out, 
those 
events 

are still a long 
way off. Right 
now, the Wol-
verines (4-5 Big 
Ten, 19-13 overall) are squarely 
focused on their upcoming week-
end series at Penn State.

“We 
haven’t 
accomplished 

anything 
yet,” 
Bakich 
said. 

“We still have our backs firmly 
pressed against the wall.”

The Nittany Lions’ record (1-4, 

9-18) suggests that they are not 
a major threat to Michigan. But 
Penn State still does have a few 
weapons in its arsenal. Outfielder 
Aaron Novak boasts a .371 batting 
average with four home runs, and 
pitcher Nick Distasio possesses a 
3.58 ERA.

For 
Michigan, 
little-known 

sophomore 
outfielder 
Johnny 

Slater who emerged as Tuesday’s 
hero. After batting just .172 last 
season, he launched two home 
runs — the first of his collegiate 
career — and drove in six Tuesday, 
which matched his 2014 RBI total.

And it’s not just power hit-

ting where the Wolverines excel. 
Junior infielder Jacob Cronen-
worth holds the runner-up posi-
tion in the Big Ten in walks with 
22 and in runs scored with 34.

“We’re one of those offenses 

where it’s tough to get through 
all nine hitters,” Bakich said. “We 
have nine guys that are produc-
tive.”

Michigan’s injuries are heal-

ing, too. Junior infielder Travis 
Maezes and junior left-handed 
pitcher Evan Hill are back and are 
contributing to the Wolverines’ 

cause. Maezes has 10 hits in 21 
at-bats with six runs scored since 
his return to the lineup on April 
1. Hill, meanwhile, started Tues-
day’s game and surrendered one 
run on two hits in two innings.

“The first month (of rehab) was 

an absolute grind,” Hill said. “I 
wouldn’t wish that on anybody.”

However, sophomore right-

hander Keith Lehmann remains 
sidelined with an injury, along 
with fellow sophomore right-
hander Jackson Lamb. Neither of 
them have seen action in a game 
in about a month.

‘M’ hosts Ohio State

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

Within the confines of the 

Michigan men’s lacrosse team’s 
locker room, a clock has been 
ticking, 
counting 
down to the 
moment 
that 

the Wolverines 
hope will be 
remembered 
in the record 
books.

Sunday, 

when 
the 

time 
expires, 

Michigan 
(1-1 

Big Ten, 5-5 
overall) 
will 

host 
No. 
12 

Ohio State (2-0, 9-3) at Michigan 
Stadium in hopes of earning its 
first win against its archrival 
in the season’s most highly 
anticipated matchup.

In 
the 
previous 
three 

battles, 
the 
Buckeyes 
have 

dominated the Wolverines, going 
undefeated and winning each 
game decisively. But this team 
has taken tremendous strides 
maturing since the two teams 
last met, and Michigan should 
feel more confident heading into 
Sunday’s game than in previous 
meetings.

After earning the program’s 

first Big Ten win against Rutgers, 
Michigan is hoping it can carry 
over the momentum, especially 
on the offensive end. After 
struggling for much of the season, 
the Wolverines solved some of 
the scoring issues they have had 
in a 10-goal performance against 
the Scarlet Knights.

“We 
were 
very 
good 
in 

transition 
against 
Rutgers, 

and that was a big part of our 
success,” said Michigan coach 
John Paul. “We’ve figured out 
that if our offense is struggling a 

little bit, the transition’s been an 
important piece for us.”

That tactic may not prove to 

be as effective, though, against 
a physical Ohio State defense. 
The Buckeyes rank ninth in 
the country in goals allowed, 
surrendering 7.83 per game, and 
have given up 10 or more goals 
just three times this season.

Michigan has had no problem 

creating scoring opportunities 
in recent weeks, but it hasn’t 
been efficient in capitalizing on 
them. The return of sophomore 
attacker Ian King was a big boost 
for a struggling Wolverine offense 
against Rutgers, but Michigan’s 
attack will need to finish whatever 
chances it gets to overcome the 
stingy Buckeye defense.

“There were opportunities on 

the table that we either didn’t 
see or didn’t execute, and we’ve 
got to be better at executing,” 
Paul said. “Having (King) back 
helps, but we’re not going to win 
games because he’s back. We 
need everybody to continue to 
learn and improve from when we 
couldn’t capitalize the last few 
games.”

On 
the 
opposite 
sideline, 

another King will also be lurking, 
looking to poach goals. Ohio 
State senior attacker Jesse King 
(no relation) currently leads 
the conference with 39 points 
and is coming off a five-goal 
performance 
against 
Johns 

Hopkins.

“(Ohio 
State) 
works 
very 

hard to get the ball to their best 
players, Jesse King certainly, in 
advantageous positions,” Paul 
said. “They do a lot of things you 
have to prepare for, and that’s 
what we’ve been doing this week 
— preparing to slow down the 
areas of the game they’re so good 
at.”

The Buckeyes score a majority 

of their goals early during 
offensive 
possessions, 
which 

has proved to be a risky strategy 
that yields inconsistent results. 
Though Ohio State scored 15 
goals against Johns Hopkins last 
Sunday, the Buckeyes were shut 
out against Notre Dame, a feat 
accomplished just six times in 
Division I since 2007.

Scoring struggles have been 

especially prevalent on the road 
for Ohio State, where it has 
endured all three of its losses. 
With the Buckeyes matching 
up 
with 
a 
much-improved 

Wolverine defense, goals could 
be at a premium if Ohio State 
can’t find King in the right spots.

Facing a ranked opponent 

will be a challenge for Michigan. 
The Wolverines are 0-19 all-time 
against top-20 teams, a streak 
that has ominously hung over the 
program since its inception.

Michigan’s 
seniors 
view 

Sunday’s 
matchup 
as 
an 

opportunity to break recent 
trends and leave a permanent 
mark on the young, up-and-
coming program. The veteran 
group has stayed committed 
to the program through all the 
losses and believes the time has 
come to validate the hard work 
they have put into building from 
the ground up.

While the seniors have been 

leading and sharing anecdotes 
with the rest of team all week, 
Paul knows when game time 
comes, it won’t take much to get 
his team motivated for an already 
emotional rivalry game.

“It’s funny, because as much 

as you have guys stepping up 
and talking about how much this 
game means, the reality is when 
you’re at Michigan vs. Ohio State, 
you don’t need that,” Paul said. 
“You know this is a big game, 
and all of the other pomp and 
circumstance and fluff you don’t 
need. It’s part of who we are here 
a Michigan. When we play Ohio 
State, we gotta be ready to go.”

Michigan set for 
series at Rutgers

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

When the Michigan softball 

team heads to Piscataway on 
Friday to play Rutgers for the 
first time, it 
will be licking 
its 
chops, 

ready to play 
one of the Big 
Ten’s 
newest 

opponents.

“We’re still 

pretty excited 
with Rutgers 
being a new 
team in the 
Big Ten,” said 
sophomore 
left 
fielder 

Kelly 
Christner. 
“It’ll 
be 

awesome 
playing them 
for the first time. We’re excited 
and ready to go.”

The 
fourth-ranked 

Wolverines (7-2 Big Ten, 34-6 
overall) are hoping to keep some 
momentum after an 11-1 win 
against Eastern Michigan on 
Tuesday. That performance was 
one of their best of the year, as 
they allowed only one hit while 
racking up nine of their own. 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
was pleased with the effort, but 
emphasized that what happened 
on Tuesday is in the past and 
will not dictate the outcome of 
the upcoming series.

“I’d like to see us take bases 

and pound the ball in the 
ground,” Hutchins said. “And 
you know, we didn’t hit the ball 
over the wall at all and got 11 runs 
(against Eastern Michigan). I’d 
like to see us score runs — we 
scored runs in every inning, but 

that was (Tuesday).”

The midweek contest served 

as a warm-up for the Wolverines 
before their matchup with the 
Scarlet Knights, an opportunity 
to fine-tune their mechanics and 
fundamentals.

“(The midweek games) keep 

us loose, really,” said senior 
pitcher 
Haylie 
Wagner. 
“I 

really just think we have these 
midweek games to stay loose 
and attack the team and just get 
better each time.”

Rutgers (7-2, 20-9) would 

rather not see Michigan get any 
better 
than 

it is already 
playing. 
The 

two teams are 
tied for second 
in the Big Ten 
standings, but 
the Wolverines 
are 
a 
more 

battle-tested 
and 
polished 

team. 
The 

Scarlet 
Knights haven’t played a ranked 
team all season, while Michigan 
has played nearly a third of its 
games against teams in the top 
25. Rutgers has played teams 
near the bottom of the Big 
Ten like Michigan State and 
Indiana. The Wolverines played 
Minnesota, 
the 
only 
other 

ranked team in the conference 
last weekend, and won two out 
of three in the series.

Rutgers is also not nearly 

the powerhouse at the plate or 
in the circle that Michigan is. 
While the Wolverines are the 
best or near it in almost every 
batting and pitching category, 
the Scarlet Knights are in the 
middle of the pack.

But Rutgers does have one 

of the best offensive players in 

the Big Ten in outfielder Jackie 
Bates. She boasts a .404 batting 
average and is second in the 
conference with a .883 slugging 
percentage 
— 
just 
behind 

Michigan’s 
junior 
second 

baseman Sierra Romero. Bates 
also had a career-high eight RBI 
in a 22-17 win against Michigan 
State.

Despite scoring a Big Ten 

season-high amount of runs in 
the game, the Scarlet Knights’ 
pitching crumbled. In the fourth 
inning 
alone, 
the 
Spartans 

scored 16 runs to take the lead, 

16-14. Rutgers 
answered 
in 
the 
next 

inning, scoring 
eight runs to 
eventually 
win 
the 

unfathomable 
game.

But judging 

by 
that 

performance, 
the Wolverines 

are once again playing a team 
with 
a 
less-than-satisfactory 

pitching staff. If they hit as 
well as they did Tuesday, there 
shouldn’t be much trouble in 
winning the series.

“I’d like to see them come 

out ready to play, be aggressive 
and dialed in, because that’s the 
only thing they can control,” 
Hutchins said.

Rutgers joined the Big Ten 

last year, but it hasn’t been fully 
introduced to the conference 
just yet. When it plays Michigan 
this weekend, it will be playing 
the 17-time Big Ten champion. 
As Michigan is vying for another 
this year, it will be prepared 
to give the Scarlet Knights a 
taste of what the best of the 
conference has to offer.
