O'Neill, Biondi ready for MLB Draft this weekend

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Writer
At age 18, Michael O'Neill
,was sure he would make it to the
MLB. He did, and then turned the
opportunity down.
Patrick Biondi figured he had
a chance when he was 16, and
tomorrow might be the day he
proves himself right.
For O'Neill, the dream of being
drafted by an MLB team became
more and more realistic during
his career at Olentangy Liberty
High School in Powell, Ohio.
"I got drafted out of high
school, so probably my senior year
it became a reality. Being drafted
was a pretty neat experience,
but I definitely needed to go to
college."
For Biondi, Divine Child
High School in Dearborn, Mich.
was home to his knack for base
stealing and superior fielding
abilities. Throughout high school,
Biondi spent time on the court
and the diamond, attempting
to decide on whether he should
pursue playing basketball or
baseball collegiately. But in his
junior year, he helped his baseball
team to a state championship and,
shortly after, he began to focus
solely on baseball. In hindsight,
he probably made the right
decision.
For both O'Neill and Biondi,
this upcoming weekend should
close the book on a long-awaited
journey to professional baseball.
From June 6 to June 8, the MLB
draft (officially known as the
First-Year Player Draft) will

take place in Secaucus, New
Jersey. Since Biondi has already
graduated from Michigan, he
won't have much say in where
he's heading for the next step of
his baseball career. But O'Neill, as
a senior next season, will be able
to weigh his options on whether
or not to forgo his final year of
eligibility at Michigan.
MLB draft rules allow for a
player to enter the draft after his
junior year of college or his 21st
birthday. If drafted, all players
have until June 15 to make a
decision on whether to sign with
their respective teams.
"I'm pretty sure I'm gonna sign
after I weigh options," O'Neill
said. "But I always have the
option to come back to Michigan,
which is nice."
Neither Biondi nor O'Neill will
be in New Jersey this weekend,
but the likelihood of them
receiving a phone call from an
MLB representative is very high.
According to Baseball America's
Top-500 prospect rankings,
O'Neill and Biondi sit at 79 and
247, respectively.
Just this past season, both
players have made significant
strides during Michigan coach
Erik Bakich's first year at the
helm. O'Neill has vastly improved
his mental strength at the plate
by increasing his patience and
swinging at the pitches he
chooses, instead of letting the
pitcher dictate the at-bat.
"Mentally is where we saw him
make the biggest jumps," Bakich
said. "He had a good plan going
up to the plate and executing

his plan. He's an extremely
aggressive hitter and I thought
he did a very good job at being
aggressive with the pitches he
was looking for."
This season, O'Neill led
the team with 17 doubles and
an impressive .498 slugging
percentage, thanks to his more
intensive approach at the plate.
Many times, he would let fastballs
go by so that he could sit on the
pitches he was expecting and
drive them to gaps in the outfield.
"If he continues to do that
throughout his career, you're
going to see his power numbers
and his slugging percentage
increase," Bakich said.
The ceiling for O'Neill's
offensive production is extremely
high, and with a rocket of an arm
in the outfield, his defense also
remains a noteworthy asset for
interested teams.
Biondi, too, has been highly
touted for his superior defensive
abilities, along with great speed
on the base paths. His late-season
position change from center field
to second base allowed for him
to become even more versatile
in both the infield and outfield.
As an undersized, left-handed
speedster with a high defensive
IQ, there will be several MLB
teams that savor Biondi's unique
skillset.
"He brings a super utility
value," Bakich said. "Some teams
will place more of an emphasis on
a left-handed hitter with speed
that plays premium defense and
can be an outfielder or an infielder
at the major league level."
Biondi scored 40 runs and
stole 19 bases this season, good
for second on the team behind
O'Neill in both categories. He
also broke the Big Ten's single-
season stolen base record when
he snatched five against Eastern
Michigan on April 17.
And those statistics aren't as
telling as they seem. In fact, those
statistics are deflated due to a
right thumb injury that sidelined
Biondi for nearly three weeks in
the middle of the season. Upon
returning to the lineup after
nursing that thumb, he was still
unable to fully swing the bat and
was forced to bunt at each trip
to the plate for at least a week.
And in the final home series of
the year against Purdue, Biondi
took a pitch to the back in his first

Junior center fielder Michael O'Neill along with senior second baseman Patrick
Bionid, are expected to be selected in the MLB Draft this weekend in New Jersey.

at-bat, bruising a lung that caused
him to continuously spit up blood
when he was sidelined for the rest
of the game.
Injury after injury, Biondi still
came back and outperformed
the majority of his teammates,
both mentally and physically.
The durability and endurance
in Biondi's toolset makes him
coveted by MLB teams, but
isn't something that scouts
immediately notice, though.
"The most important tool is his
makeup and the intangibles that he
has," Bakich said. "Regardless of
where he gets drafted, he is going
to will himself to the major-league
level. He's just going to do it."
Bakich admitted that Biondi
was only 100 percent healthy for
the first 15 games of the season,
but his grit and already-proven
talent helped lead Michigan to its
first Big Ten Tournament since
2010.
"To see him put the needs of
the team ahead of his own, and
just be in there to contribute in
any positive way possible, that
was the most impressive thing,"
Bakich said. "That's a kid, in
my opinion, who is extremely
mentally tough."

Even though O'Neill and Biondi
will be away fromNew Jersey this
weekend, that doesn't change the
anticipation surrounding a long-
awaited phone call. It's almost
a forgone conclusion that the
two will be drafted by Saturday,
but the waiting game still comes
along with reaching a coveted
milestone.
"I'll be in Ann Arbor probably
trying to do something to keep
my mind off things," Biondi said.
"I know my mom and dad are
coming out so I'll probably just be
hanging out with them."
But even once they get the call,
both Biondi and O'Neill have
expressed that the feeling will be
quite surreal.
"I've thought about it, but I'm
not really sure how I'll take it,"
O'Neill said. "It's an exciting
time in my life so I'll be with my
family."
O'Neill and Biondi knew this
day would come. The waiting
game will end by Saturday, but
the pair will most likely learn
where their headed much sooner
than that.
And at age 21, O'Neill and
Biondi will realize they've
dreamt reality.

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins watches as her team fails to produce offensively, compiling just 10 hits in three games in the Women's College World Series last weekend.

Wolverines return
from first World
Series since 2009
By GREG GARNO and
ERIN LENNON
Managing Sports Editor and Daily
Sports Reporter
OKLAHOMA CITY - With her
season one out away from coming
to an end, co-captain Jaclyn

Crummey came up to bat looking
to start a rally. But after she had
played hero two inningsbefore, the
senior could do nothing more than
watch strike three pass by.
With two outs in the bottom
of the fifth inning, Crummey had
stepped up to the plate for her 67th
career at-bat. Sixty feet later, it was
Crummey - a pinch runner her
entire career - who stood on first
base as No. 8 Michigan softball
team's savior in the Women's College
World Series with her second hit of

the game and third-career RBL
The Wolverines were six outs
away from forcing a second match-
up against No.1 Oklahoma, but two
defensive miscues later, the Wol-
verines saw the narrow 1-0 lead
turn into a three-run deficit.
Michigan ultimately fell 4-1
to No. 11 Washington on Sunday,
concluding its season and
sending the Wolverines home
after their first trip to the WCWS
since 2009.
"Although the loss always hurts,

I've got to tell you what - I'm
proud of this group," said Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins. "They're
great Michigan women and they
represent this University with
class. They play hard. They play
hard for Michigan and they play
hard for each other."
Whereas the defense sparkled
in a 2-0 victory over No. 5 Arizona
State the night before, the Wolver-
ines' season-long weakness was
exploited for four runs in the sixth.

Students reopen Detroit case owacty doeeaminato

Michigan Innocence
Clinic to reexamine
non-DNA evidence
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Almost seven years ago, a man
in Detroit drove into a parking lot
with a female passenger and was
shot by an acquaintance. As the
driver tried to pull away, a sec-

ond shooter reportedly joined the
first, killing the female passenger.
Last week, the Michigan
Supreme Court ruled that the
Court of Appeals review the case
again. The Michigan Innocence
Clinic - part of the University's
Law School which works to
investigate and litigate cases for
prisoners - has new evidence
that may establish the innocence
of the second suspect.
At the time of the case, Car-
los Strong, the first shooter, left

Detroit and was not found. Dawan
Tyner, a Detroit resident, was
arrested on suspicion of being
the second shooter. The driver of
the car testified that Tyner may
have been the second shooter but
admitted that he was not sure.
Tyner was sentenced to 22 to
40 years in prison for second-
degree murder. Imran Syed, a
staff attorney for the the clinic
said the ruling was a "compro-
mise decision."

University to launch fundraising
campaign in November 2013

Garnering financial
aid funds for
students top priority
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Over the last few months,
University administrators and the
University's.Board of Regents have
welcomed several multi-million
dollar donations - the $110 million
donation from Charles Munger to
build a graduate residence hall and
the $50 million from the Zell Family
Foundation to endow the Masters of
Fine Arts in Creative Writing broke
records for University and LSA
giving respectively.
But the University's rallying cry
for philanthropic action has yet to
officially commence.
After months of planning and
two years of courting preliminary
donors, University officials are set
to launch the next capital campaign
Nov. 8.
In April, an army of campaign
leaders and volunteers - as well as
students, faculty and outgoing and
incoming provosts Phil Hanlon
and Martha Pollack, respectively -
met in preparation for November's
kickoff.
At the meeting, real estate
mogul and University alum
Stephen Ross announced he would

"It was a pretty weak identifica-
tion, (the witness) said that he could
have been wrong," Syed said. "That's
pretty significant when a witness
says that."
Last spring, it was revealed that
Strong made several phone calls
to his mother and girlfriend both
admitting his crime and saying that
Tyner was in fact not at the scene of
the crime at all. After Strong's death,
a suspected suicide,his mother came
forward with the new evidence.
The clinic is helping Tyner appeal
his case to the State Supreme Court
after new evidence was found that
may indicate he is innocent of the
murder he was convicted of in 2007.

chair the campaign although he
extended an open invitation for a
co-chair to join him.
Tom Baird, assistant vice
president of campaign strategy at
the University, said a chair serves
as the campaign's "top volunteer,"
providing a public persona, bringing
leaders together and solidifying the
campaign's brand.
While the University has found
its top volunteer, scores more
are needed to run a successful
campaign - and many of them have
already assumed a ready position.
Baird said volunteers are crucial in
any capital campaign as they form
committees, bolster the University's
network of connections, serve on
regional committees and tell the
University's story.
"They serve as examples of
people that are giving back and
having an impact," Baird said.
"They tell the story that Michigan is
important to support and endorsing
what people can achieve with the
University of Michigan through
their giving. They can have a real
impact on the world."
In framing the campaign,
University administrators have
set a list of focus areas for giving,
which Baird said would focus less
on infrastructure projects than
its predecessor, The Michigan
Difference, which ended in 2008
and raised $3.2 billion.
The campaign's highest priority
Strong's mother and girlfriend
testified and the case was granted
a motion for a new trial, although
the court of appeals reversed the
decision without hearing the case.
The clinic then took the case to the
State Supreme Court who ordered it
sent back to the Court of Appeals for
review.
Syed said although Tyner did
eventually get his whole story heard,
cases such as these, which he labeled
as a "weak conviction," often go
unchecked.
"It's not that uncommon that
someone gets convicted on the tes-
timony of just one witness," Syed
said. "Our system has 'proof beyond
a reasonable doubt' but I don't think
people understand in practice how
little that is."
Devon Holstad, a student attor-
ney forthe clinic, said the trendsthat

will be extending greater financial
aid to University students.
Additionally, the University
hopes to focus on projects to
extend classroom learning into
real world experiences that could
develop students' global views or
entrepreneurial spirits, for example.
Pollack said the University also
intends to use gifts toward public
good, centering around four areas:
human and environmental health,
poverty and inequality, sustainable
transportation and K-12 education.
"The University's a great
platform to have impact," Baird
said. "It's a very collaborative
institution. It's a place where if
you want to have an impact in any
area of human endeavor, Michigan
can probably help you realize your
passions by supporting people
doing the hard work that are the
best in the world."
In a February interview,
University President Mary Sue
Coleman told The Michigan Daily
the campaign must showcase the
power of giving in the lives of
students and faculty.
"We need to fashion this in a
way donors can get excited about
the difference they can make in
people's lives so a lot of this will be
storytelling about what students
have done and what the impact of
having various scholarships has
been," Coleman said.
Baird said University
lead to weak convictions include
faulty witness identification and
prosecutorial misconduct.
"They want to convict someone,"
Holstad said. "So they will latch onto
the first person that it may seem like
there's a chance that they commit-
ted the crime and ... ignore any other
evidence to the contrary."
Syed said another common prob-
lem in wrongful convictions is poor
representation for the accused. The
National Legal Aid and Defender
Association reported in 2011 that
Michigan ranked 44th in public
defense spending, with $7.35 spent
per capita.
"It has a lot to do with money but
it has a lot to do with things slipping
under the radar," Syed said. "In a
situation where budgets are tight,
criminal defendants aren't exactly
the first that get consideration."

Communications Director Lisa
Rudgers would likely play a
role in not only the branding
of the campaign, but also help
to effectively disseminate the
University's narrative to donors.
The upcoming project would
include a greater web presence and
emphasis on social media.
In addition, Baird said
telling the University's story to
potential donors takes on greater
importance as other universities
compete for donors' dollars. With
the end of the 2009 recession,
Baird said more public universities
have begun launching campaigns.
Campaigns by large private
institutions like Stanford - which
raised $6.2 billion - have brought
in billions of dollars.
With roughly five months before
the campaign launches, campaign
organizers are continuing to set
goals and organize volunteers. The
campaign's name, fundraising goal
and end date have yet to be set, along
with the campaign's role in the
University's upcoming bicentennial.
Development officials will also
continue to raise money for the
campaign's Nucleus Fund - gifts
collected in advance of a campaign's
launch. Since July 2011, the
University has gathered one billion
dollars in donations.
With the latest capital
campaign yet to begin, this total is
far from final.
The clinic is one of few in the
country that deals specifically with
non-DNA evidence. Syed said often
the only cases that are reopened
are those where new DNA evidence
emerges because DNA evidence is
considered the most likelyto change
the outcome of a case.
However, most cases don't have
any DNA evidence at all and prob-
lems like faulty witness testimony
are much more common, Syed said.
Brian Levy, a student attorney in
the clinic, said while DNA evidence
revealed the extent of wrongful con-
victions, there is now a much higher
demand for non-DNA clinics that
has not yet been met.
"There are constantly cases that
we are having to put on hold and not
able to investigate," Levy said. "It's
very sad that we can't do more than
we're doing."

Report Card: Grading Michi

n softball's 2013 season

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA,
ERIN LENNON and GREG
GARNO
Daily Sports Writers
From Orlando, Fla. to Fullerton,
Calif, to Lincoln, Neb., and finally
Oklahoma City, the No. 8 Michigan
softball team went the distance this
season,literally.Likeanyyoungteam
- one that boasted seven freshman
and four sophomores on its roster
- Michigan has experienced the
turbulence associated with a five-
monthseason and arunat anational
championship.
There were the highs - two
Super Regional final comeback
wins. to send the Wolverines to
the Women's College World Series
- and the lows, like an early exit
from the Big Ten tournament.
As it is in the classroom along
with the softball field, after the final
comes the grade.
Most Valuable Player: Sara
Driesenga
Sure, freshman shortstop Sierra
Romero swung her way to a Big Ten
Player of the Year award. But like
the old saying goes: They can't win
if they don't score.
For that reason, this year's most
valuable player is sophomore right-
hander Sara Driesenga.
Inplace ofthe preseason National
Collegiate Player ofthe Year finalist,
Haylie Wagner, Driesenga was
a horse from the start. Pitching
became the story of non-conference
play, as Driesenga bailed out a
streaking, youngoffense to earn the
Wolverines 21 victories. And when
Wagner returned, Driesenga didn't
relinquish her spot as Michigan's
No. I on the pitching staff.
When an offense that warranted
preceding adjectives like explosive,
contagious,potentorunstoppablein
the regular season was shut down
during the postseason, it was
Driesenga in the driver's seat all the
way to Oklahoma.
The Hudsonville, Mich. native
threw four complete-game shutouts
in nine NCAA tournament appear-
ances and earned seven victories.
Driesenga finished her
sophomore season with a 1.89
ERA and 31 of Michigan's 51 team
victories - a performance worthy
of first team All-Big Ten honors and
Michigan's 2013 MVP.
Most Improved: Sierra

improved player.
A recruit out of Greater Atlanta
Christian High School, Lawrence
was projected to find her home
next to a fellow Sierra, as in fresh-
man shortstop Sierra Romero. As a
senior in high school, Lawrence hit
.568 with a record-setting 14 home
runs and 49 bases stolen - a testa-
ment to her speed at 5-foot-8.
After struggling through fall ball,
Lawrence was questionable as a
starter, let alone a starting infielder.
When Romero secured her position
at shortstop, Lawrence was forced
to adjust to the outfield - in the
Wolverines' only unfilled position
in left field. The freshman commit-
ted three fielding errors in Febru-
ary and March, but was perfect the
remainder of the season.
Much like her defense, Lawrence
found her home in the batting order
midway through the season. In just
six days as the number-nine hitter,
Lawrence used her speed to turn
over the lineup and score 26 runs
for the offense in six Michigan
victories. A mid-season offensive
surge pushed Lawrence up in the
order behind junior slugger Caitlin
Blanchard.
Though it took a few months
to brand 'The Sierra's,' both were
selected to represent the United
States on the 2013 Junior Women's
National team in April.
In the Wolverines' final game at
the Women's College World Series,
Lawrence was the only player to
score against Washington - after
stealing second base, no less.
Lawrence finished the season
hitting.314 with 47 runs scored and
a team-leading 11 stolen bases, and
was one of six Wolverines named to

the All-Big Ten first team.
Offense: A/A-
It's tough to give Michigan any-
thing less than this grade after the
numbers it put up. Really, this team
went as far as its offense went.
The Wolverines finished the sea-
son tied with Tennessee for sixth
place in runs scored, with 6.64, and
entered the NCAA Tournament
ranked second. They finished 15th
nationally in team batting average
(.321) and had the Big Ten Player of
the Year in slugger Sierra Romero.
Butthe postseasonmay be a more
accurate determiner of how the
offense actually performed, which
simply put, was nohexistent. The
Wolverines ranked eighth out of
the eight teams in the WCWS and
totaled just 10 hits while scoring
only four runs. Only Arizona State
(Michigan's only win) had less runs,
but played fewer games.
And while the Big Ten season
may have contributed to inflated
numbers, they were still spectacu-
lar. Nine mercy-rule victories, 21
runs in a game and 74 home runs
certainly deserve some respect.
Pitching: B+
Sara Driesenga can only do so
much. And while she certainly is
deserving of Michigan's MVP, her
teammate in the circle couldn't
quite keep up, bringing this grade
down just a notch.
Driesenga and her teammate,
sophomore left-hander Haylie
Wagner, put up impressive numbers
together, like a combined ERA of
2.38. Along with right-handers,
freshman Alice Fitzpatrick and
senior Stephanie Speierman, the
Wolverines posted a solid 2.31 ERA,
good for 41st in the nation.

But Wagner was injured and
never fully regained her old self
from last year's stellar season. Fitz-
patrick and Speierman were never
strong enough to fill in, and both
ended the season with a high ERA.
The result was a one-woman show
that exposed depth at a position that
wasn't expected to be an issue.
Defense: B-
In a second elimination game
against Washington on Sunday, the
No. 8 Michigan softball team car-
ried a one-run lead into the top of
the sixth inning with a chance at a
rematch with No.1 Oklahoma.
The Huskies led off the inning
with a single. A subsequent ball
off of sophomore pitcher Sara
Driesenga's ankle into right field
and throws to home, second and
third, put Washington up by one
with a runner on third.
It was one of the rare times
the defense had failed Driesenga
throughout the Wolverine'sjourney
to the WCWS, but something that
didn't surprise Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins.
As a team, Michigan committed
77 errors this season, which is well
over an error a game.
And while the roster may have
boasted offensive stars, the defense
often looked like a whole different
team. Freshman shortstop and
hitting sensation Sierra Romero
may have hit 23 home runs, but she
finished the season with a team-
leading 24 errors at shortstop. With
13 errors of her own, senior second
baseman Ashley Lane finished her
season second to Romero in both
home runs and errors.
The team also converted just 22
double plays on the season.

The Wolverines earn a passing
grade on defense because of the post
season and the post season alone.
When a laboring Driesenga found
herself with the bases loaded several
times throughout the WCWS, it was
the defense that came through in ,
the clutch.
In Michigan's sole victory in
Oklahoma City against Arizona
State, senior third baseman Amy
Knapp - a newcomer to third
base in her senior year - fielded a
sharp grounder and threw home
to start a 5-2-3 double play and
end a bases-loaded threat. At third,
Knapp committed just six errors
this season - the lowest among
Michigan infielders. Lauren Sweet
also finished with a team-leading
.986 fielding percentage.
Like alB' at the classroom, there's
room for improvement.
Final Grade: A/A-
Hutchins has done it again.
A winning season is not enough.
More than 1,300 wins is not enough.
With a program that has won 15
conference titles, made 10 world
series and taken home a national
championship - the first and
only title east of the Mississippi -
Oklahoma was always the goal.
Still, this season was intended to ...
be one of rebuilding. Having lost all-
star Amanda Chidester and captain
Bree Evans, 2013 was to be about
grooming the talented freshmen
class into a title-winning machine.
Hutchins talked of potential for
greatness from early on, if only this
squad would realize its potential in
time.

The Wolverines went undefeated
in the Big Ten before meeting
Nebraska in Lincoln to snap
a 23-game winning streak. At
Alumni Field, the home team was
undefeated during the regular
season and dropped just one game
in the NCAA Super Regional to
Louisiana-Laffayette.
But at the WCWS, the Wolverines
were given a taste of their own
medicine by top-seeded Oklahoma

would go undefeated en route to a
national championship. And yet,
with their backs up against the wall

nonetheless, Michigan earned a
victory over Arizona to extend its
season, if only by hours.
For now, let's remember that
this team was one of eight teams to

to win a game while in Oklahoma
City.

Best and worst of Michigan's 2013 season

A season that began many
months ago in the echoing com-
fort of Oosterbaan Fielhouse
ended harshly at Hall of Fame
Stadium in Oklahoma City last
Sunday when Washington elimi-
nated the Michigan softball
team from the Women's College
World Series. Along the way, the
Wolverines enjoyed a 16-0 start
to conference play en route to a
sixth-straight Big Ten champi-
onship and a third consecutive
regional title.
The Daily revisited the highs
and lows of Michigan's season
that ended Sunday:

Best non-conference win
The Wolverines woke up on
March 15 with a losing record
against ranked opponents -
including blowout losses to LSU
and Oregon by a combined 27-10.
That all changed when Michigan
came from behind to edge No. 2
Arizona State and beat up on No.

Senior second baseman Ashley
Lane capped off a strong non-
conference slate by going 4-for-

runs, while sophomore right-
hander Sara Driesenga pitched
8.1 innings and didn't surrender
a single earned run. The pair of

into the Big Ten season, where
they won 16 consecutive games.
Worst non-conference loss
It's hard to put too much stock
into a single loss, but Michigan
coach Carol Hutchins must have
been shaking her head after the
Wolverines lost to LIU Brooklyn
on Feb. 16. The Blackhawks were
winless at the time and finished
their season well below .500. In
fact, LIU Brooklyn's 2-1 conquest
of Michigan was its only victory
over a ranked opponent this
season. The Wolverines managed
just six hits and were held
scoreless through six innings,
though they nearly managed
to tie the game in the seventh.
Despite the puzzling defeat,
Michigan regrouped and won its
next six games.
Best conference win
The Wolverines had won their
first nine Big Ten games and
shot to the top of the conference
standings, but when they hosted
Michigan State on April 12,
the Spartans were a very close
second. By the end of the day, it
was clear that Michigan State
couldn't match up with its
in-state rival. Michigan launched
six home runs and won 21-2 as
the game mercifully ended in the
fifth inning. Freshman shortstop
Sierra Romero blasted her second
grand slam of the year, and
sophomore catcher Lauren Sweet
and junior outfielder Lyndsay
Doyle both recorded two hits in a
13-run third inning. Even seldom-
used junior Katie Luetkens joined
in on the fun with her first career
homer and RBI.
Worst conference loss
Michigan went 20-2 in the Big
Ten regular season, which limit-
ed the number of losses to choose
from. The Wolverines lost their
only regular-season series to No.
20 Nebraska in late April, and
that's why both qualify for the
worst conference loss. The first
game, a 6-1 defeat on April 26,
ended a 22-game win streak as
one of the nation's highest-scor-
ing offenses went mysteriously
silent, and the Michigan pitchers
struggled two days later in a 7-4
loss. Maybe the Wolverines were

May belonged to Ashley Lane. The
senior finished the season batting
.363 with no hit more important
than the walk-off two-run homer
that catapulted Michigan to a 4-3
win over Louisiana-Lafayette in
extra innings. The Wolverines
had come within an out of sealing
the win before the Ragin' Cajuns
smashed two home runs to tie the
game in the seventh and take the
lead in the eighth. But after junior
Caitlin Blanchard was hit by a
pitch, Lane responded with a no-
doubt shot that sent the packed
crowd at Alumni Field into a
frenzy. Michigan went on to win
the Super Regional - thanks to
Lane's two-run double in Game
3 - and advance to the program's
10th WCWS.

Patent trolling

Legacy admiussions
'U' should clarify how legacy factors into applications
According to a recent New York Times article, the University's
enrollment of low-income students is substantially lower than sev-
eral similar universities. Though there are many factors contribut-
ing to that fact, one, legacy status, stands out for its role in the admissions
process. How the Office of Undergraduate Admissions uses legacy status
while making decisions isn't readily apparent, though it does collect that
data. Other schools have released admissions data for legacy applicants,
and some have even gone as far as dropping legacy entirely from their
admissions process. The University should follow both of these examples
- legacy status is a dubious category to include in an application process.
At the very least, admissions should clarify its policy towards legacy admis-
sions and make information about the acceptance rate for legacy students

Many major technology com-
panies such as Apple, Hewlett-
Packard, Samsung and Dell
have been bombarded with law-
suits on the grounds of patent
infringement. Patent holding
firms, or "patent trolls," accu-
mulate and bundle together
portfolios of patents and then
sue major companies for pat-
ent infringement. These patent
trolls then make a quick buck off
licensing fees and damages and
force companies to take on cost-
lylawsuits to protect their prod-
ucts. Sometimes businesses are
sued without even knowing the
owner of the patent. Businesses
are put at a disadvantage as pat-
ent trolls exploit loopholes in
the system.
Rep. Ted Deutch's (D-Fla.)
End Anonymous Patents Act
was introduced and passed in
an effort to combat patent troll-
ing activities and put a stop
to some of its inflictions upon
businesses, such as discourag-
ing future inventions, and it
would strengthen the patent
system. With the introduction
and enforcement of the EAPA,
there will be tightened regula-
tion in place and inventors and
small businesses will be free
from the grip of patent trolls
who are currently abusing the
patent system for personal gain,
The customer-suit exception
is one part of the EAPA that is
invoked as an exception to the
First-Filed rule, which allows a
federal district court to decide
what to do with a complaint
when there's already a similar
complaint set as a precedent in
court. Customer-suit exception
allows a later filed case against
or by the manufacturer to take
precedent over the earlier filed
case. Since the manufacturer
must protect customers in order
to avoid rulings against its prod-
ucts, the manufacturer is tech-
nically the "true defendant in a
case." Compared to an individu-
al customer, a manufacturer has
a stronger interest in defending
on the grounds of minimizing
litigation cost than they do for
litigating merits of the case. The
greater influence the manu-
facturer has is salient to busi-
ness's long-term growth. Thus,
it's in the favor of the business
being sued to be able to turn to
the customer-suit exception for

legal assistance.
By demanding letters and
litigation, the EAPA would
also make the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office keep records
of patents and be informed of
real-party-in-interest infor-
mation. Increased transpar-
ency would help to reduce the
defendant's litigation cost by
eliminating the real owner of
the patent's anonymity. In addi-
tion, a user-friendly webpage
would be made available for
the public to access basic pat-
ent data recorded at PTO. The
freer flow of basic information
shall increase transparency
and make it more efficient for
both the general public and
businesses to make evaluations
and judgments.
The EAPA and its
enforcement would save small
companies and businesses
from being ripped off by patent
trolls. With ample information
resources, companies would be
able to protect their products
and services by analyzing and
comparing patent-holding firms
before deciding to do business
with them. This is the age
of information. To a trader,
having information about a
stock allows for more precise
prediction. In the case of
patents having information
about patent-holding firms and
patent records collectedby PTO
allows for higher transparei'
and better protection winh
in turt encourageo more
proprietary inventions.
In response to the increase
in patent abuse cases, the EA P
was introduced and implemen:-
ed to restore and reinforce the
dignified freedom that was key
to nurturing new inventions and
new ideas. The customer-suit
exception will allow manufac-
turers to take a legal stance in
the best interests of the business
as the true defendant in court.
With more transparency and
information resources, there
will be reduced litigation costs
and businesses will be more
effectively protected from pat-
ent trolls. The End Anonymous
Patents Act will be a big part of
the solution to strengthen the
patent system and encourage
business inventions.

The

gan
women's tennis team may be the
exception, though.
This year's team won a Big Ten
title, but time after time couldn't
win on the big stage. Despite the
title, the Wolverines could've
done more.
Entering her sixth year as head
coach, Ronni Bernstein had a rock
solid team, from top to bottom.
But the depth couldn't prove
enough in crunch time.
Michigan fell in the Big Ten
Tournament final, was ousted in
the Sweet 16, and no individual
team got passed the second round
of the NCAA Championships.
Under Bernstein, the program
has been successful. The Big Ten
Coach of the Year stresses team
over self, and in turn, individual
success occurs. But come crunch
time, the team faltered.
After losing just once in the
Big Ten season, the Wolverines
won their fourth-straight Big Ten
title, and were poised to bring
that momentum tuto the Big Ten
Tournament
For Michigan, the Big Ten
Tournament has been a struggle
in recent years, as it can never
seem to win the crown. For the
past eight years, the Wolverines
have fallen in the final and seven
of those times were to Northwest-
ern.
And this year was no different.
Though they defeated the
Wildcats in their regular season
meeting, the Wolverines couldn't
find a way to win when the
tournament was on the line.
ThetournamentwasMichigan's
to lose - the Wolverines boasted
a far stronger singles lineup and
more depth than Northwestern
brought to the table.
What plagued this year's team
was the inability to regroup and
compose itself after giving up the
doubles point. Michigan was 19-0
when winning the point, but just
3-6 without it.
And while the 19-0 record is
noteworthy, the best teams, like

the 2013 champion, Stanford,
manage to fight back after they
give up the doubles point.
When a team relies so heavily
on the doubles point, it must
put out three competitive duos.
Depth, not a star-studded pair,
is what makes the best teams so
good.
This year, Michigan's third
position had an 8-14 record. When
a spot in the lineup struggles so
heavily, like the Wolverines' third
pair, the pressure is increased
drastically for the top two pairs.
If Michigan's most reliable pair,
junior Brooke Bolender and
sophomore Emina Bektas, are
losing, or even the second pair,
it's almost a sure-fire bet that the
Wolverines will lose the doubles
point. More times than not, the
third pair could not get the win,
putting enormous pressure on the
first two teams.
Take the NCAA Team
Championships, for example.
No. 10 Michigan was taking on
No. 7 UCLA and knew it needed
the doubles point to win the meet.
UCLA boasted one of the strongest
singles lineups in the country,
complemented by a successful
group of doubles pairings.
But the team's third pair
was dominated, putting all the
pressure on the top two pairs.
Bektas and Bolender pulled out a
win on their court, but the second
pair couldn't grind out the win,
giving UCLA the point.
The Bruins went onto win three
singles matches, removing the
Wolverines from the tournament
and ending their team season.
If the 2013-14 team needs to fix
one thing, it's the doubles lineup.
Michigan proved to be unbeat-
able when winning the point, and
by solidifying bottom pairings the
team will see greatness.
The good news for the
Wolverines isthatthey'rebringing
back their top pair of Bektas and
Bolender, and will have a veteran
in sophomore Sarah Lee and the
Big Ten Freshman of the Year
Ronit Yurovsky.
On the individual side, the team
also needs more.
Michigan has the skill to win
on the national level. Bektas and
Bolender were a 5-8 seed in the
doubles draw, earning them All-
American status, and were already

playing familiar opponents from
UCLA.
But the reliable pair faltered,
losing in straight sets. Though
the Bruins were a very strong and
capable team, this was a shocking
upset. The Wolverine pair
throughout the season cited their
success based on aggressiveness
and an ability to fight, but come
crunch time, it failed.
This pair will need to
rebound next season. Bektas and
Bolender play with a style that
all the Michigan pairings should
emulate. Having both players at
the net every point could be the
strategy Bernstein should instill
in all three teams, and there is
no better way to learn than from
Bektas and Bolender.
Singles is a different story.With
only two NCAA qualifiers, Bektas
and Yurovsky, not much was
expected. Yet the results were still
disappointing.
Bektas was ousted in the first
round, which marked the second
straight year this happened. If
Bektas truly wants to cement her
legacy as one of the Michigan
greats, she will need to do moreon
the national stage.
Yurovsky's results were
different. The freshman got to
the second round and lost to the
eventual champion, Nicole Gibbs
of Stanford. Yurovsky gave Gibbs
arguably her toughest match of
the tournament, though. The
Wolverines have a lot to look
forward to in Yurovsky.
If there's one thing to know
about this year's singles lineup,
it's that it was young, overall.
Michigan's oldest singles player
was junior Bolender.
With such a young team,
growing pains were going to be
inevitable. The team showed
success but when playing three-
set matches, the opposing team
usually pulled out the win. With
time, three-set wins and the
mental fortitude will get better.
With the whole singles lineup
returning, and with the additions
of five-star recruit Sara Remynse
and Colombian Laura Ucros,
this team should boast one of the
strongest lineups in the Big Ten
and even the country.
The future is bright for the
Wolverines, and only they can
control their destiny.

This weekend marked the
Michigan women's rowing team's
sixth-straight appearance in the
NCAA Championships. Though all
eyes were set on seizing their 13th
Top-10 finish in program history, it
failed to do so, settling for 12th.
In the end, the Wolverines con-
cluded the NCAA Championships
with a ninth-place showing in the
1V8, 12th in the 1V4, and 15th in the
2V8. In total, Michigan only accu-
mulated 69 points throughout the
competition. The first place finish-
er, Ohio State, amassed 126.
Upon entering competition,
Michigan was ranked the 12th seed
in the first varsity eight, 15th seed
in the second varsity eight and the
13th seed in the varsity four.
On the first day of competition,
the Wolverines' 1v8 placed third in
theirheatwithatimeof(7:02.313,13
seconds behind first-place Virginia
(6:49.64). The 2v8 also finished
third in their race, finishing with a
time of7:08.61-12 seconds behind
California - while the 1v4 finished
4th behind Washington, Notre

Dame and UCLA.
These results forced Michigan
to row in the repechage races in the
afternoon, where it would have to
climbup the ladder format to decide
the team's placement in the finals.
The 1v8 came out strong, winning
their heat with a time of 7:09.964.
The first place performance pushed
the Wolverines to an A/B semifinal
showing the following day.
The 2v8 came in third in their
repechage heat behind UCLA and
Stanford with a time of 7:31.747, but
Michigan was senttothe C/D semi-
finals, as only the top two finishers
in each heat advance to A/B's.
However, what the Wolverines
lacked in speed this season, they
made up for in wit. The women's
rowing team placed 18 student-
athletes on the All-Big Tee
academic squad. Michigan also
had four student-athletes receive
Central All-Region awards from
the Collegiate Rowing Coaches
Association. Senior Melisa Ongun
and sophomore Jessica Eiffert
were selected for the first team,,
while seniors Shannon Stief and
Kate Grimaldi earned second-team

available to the public.
A "legacy" student or applicant
is someone whose sibling, parent or
grandparent went to the University.
At some schools, whether or not an
applicant has legacy status gives
that student special consideration
in the admission process. One study
looking at over two dozen univer-
sities found that a parental legacy
connection to a school increased
a student's chances of getting
accepted by up to 45.1 percent. For
an applicant to the University, how-
ever, it's extremely difficult to judge
how legacy factors into the admis-
sions process. Admissions uses the
Common Application, which col-
lects information about siblings and
parents who went to the University,

but the Undergraduate Admissions
website doesn't mention legacy as
one of the factors in the admissions
process. The presence of a question
on last year's Common App supple-
ment asking applicants to name any
grandparents who went to the Uni-
versity further confounds the issue.
Students planning to apply to
the University in the coming years
deserve to know exactly how
legacy status factors into their
applications, and it's primarily for
their sake that the University should
clarify their policy. If it is a factor,
the University should abolish this
practice. Consideration based on
legacy status is a form of nepotism
and has no place in the University

admissions process.
Other universities such as Texas
A&M and Massachusetts Institute
of Technology have eliminated leg-
acy considerations in admissions.
The University should follow suit
with these schools if it uses legacy
status in a similar way, as those
programs make it harder for other
students to get in. They also tend to
cut down on diversity, as past gen-
erations of college graduates have
had a higher proportion of whites
than the current generation. Exam-
ining how the University uses lega-
cy status in the admissions process
is a vital step towards ensuring all
students have a fair shot to get into
this University.

AATA to serve Ypsilanti. As the
city of Ypsilanti already levied its
maximum property tax allowed
on residents, services would allow
the city to acquire additional funds
for transportation through an
alternate tax.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
said he advocated the expansion,
as there's a large population of
Ann Arbor residents and Eastern
Michigan University students
who utilized Routes 5 and 6,
which service Ypsilanti, noting
that the service was "full both
ways."
The resolution incorporated
a clause to add two additional
positions to the existing seven-
person AATA board, one of
which would be held by a person

nominated by the Ypsilanti
City Council and the other a
representative of Ann Arbor.
Councilmember Stephen
Kunselman (D- Ward 3) said
the proposed amendment to the
articles of incorporation to add
additional seats was "a very small
step" compared to the greater
logistical obstacles that needed
to be overcome. Nevertheless, he
co-sponsored the item, as he said
he believed it was important for
the proposal to move forward.
"I'm not sure that it is best
that we do this before the AATA
reviews it," he added, as the
AATA board will likely propose
additional recommendations that
would warrant amendments to the
resolution.
While the item only accounted
for Ypsilanti's association with
AATA, it remains unclear whether
other area townships will want to
join the system.
"I have been a staunch
proponent of getting Ypsilanti or
the other communities (to join)
that use the AATA existing system
quite extensively," Kunselman
said. "These are the communities
that bring in the vast majority
of ridership that then brings in
federal dollars."
Council members also
discussed possible name changes
that would accompany an AATA
expansion. The amended articles

of incorporation proposed that
the corporation be renamed
to Ann Arbor Area Transport
Authority and be referred to as
The Authority.
Councilmember Sally Peterson
(D- Ward 2) said calling the public
corporation AAATA when the
only Ann Arbor area included was
Ypsilanti was misleading.
"Changing the name will
certainly come around by the
public when this makes its way,"
Kunselman said.
The council unanimously
approved the resolution by a vote
of 10-0 to add Ypsilanti to the
AATA. However, the resolution
did not enforce or ensure a
funding mechanism for the
expansion.
Jerry Lax, legal counsel for
AATA, said he supported the
resolution on the grounds that
an additional millage could
be imposed on Ann Arbor and
Ypsilanti residents to fund
AATA operations - subject to
the approval of voters during the
Nov. 6 general election.
"This is a first step, it doesn't
by itself create new funding,"
he said. "But it does give
Ypsilanti a more active role in
governance and does create a
mechanism where the voters in
both jurisdictions can approve
of (additional funding through
taxes)."

ast week, former Michigan
Supreme Court Justice Diane
Hathaway was sentenced to
one year in prison
for bank fraud.
In an attempt to
qualify on a short
sale, Hathaway x
concealed her
assets with family
members; howev-
er, she was caught DEREK
in the process of WOLFE
doing so.
According to
our written law
and to most people, Hathaway's
punishment is appropriate. She
abused her power as a justice for her
own benefit and deserves to suffer for
a year - even if it's at Camp Cupcake,
the site where TV personality Martha
Stewart served her prison stint.
However, with jail overcrowding
becoming an ever-present issue, this
approach and obsession for "sticking
it to the man" is shortsighted.
First and foremost, sentence
lengths seem incredibly arbitrary to
me. Why does Hathaway need to be
incarcerated for one year to repent for
her crime? Why not six months or two
years? I have a feeling that she already
feels guilty just by going through the
trial process.
Perhaps the greatest goal of
criminal justice should be that of
prevention. About half of prisoners
incarcerated have a mental health
problem. If these people had better
mental health resources, then it's
possible that many of these crimes
may have never happened in the
first place.
But in cases where imprisonment is
required, our prison system needs to
become a more efficient experience.
In order to do that, our philosophy
of the prison system's purpose must
change. Yes, criminals like murderers
and rapists should be jailed for greater
lengths of time seeing that they are
threats to society. But shouldn't the
overall purpose of incarceration be
about rehabilitation? Prisons should
be doing a better job of helping people
function within society upon their
release. Right now, this isn't the
case. Within three years of release,
67 percent of former inmates are
arrested and reenter the prison
world. If the system adjusted its
approach by providing opportunities
for higher education - perhaps by
taking advantage of trade school or
websites like Coursera - that figure
could certainly decrease.
That being said, a new approach
must be taken with fiscal

responsibility. Because of the amount
taxpayers are spending to incarcerate
criminals, it's become a financially
irresponsible venture. In most states,
it costs over $30,000 each year to
house one inmate. Think about it.
That's enough to send a hopeful
student to the University for a year
on scholarship. There are plenty
of other ways that money could be
spent to improve how our society
functions, including - but not limited
to - schools, infrastructure, public
transportation and health programs.
We also must alter what types of
offenses should require incarceration.
Couldn't house arrest be an
appropriate punishment for crimes
like Hathaway's? It drove Lucille
and George Bluth, Sr. from "Arrested
Development" crazy, so why couldn't
it work for her? While I make that
comment in jest, she definitely isn't a
physical threat to society, so let her be
locked up in her own home.
The era of mass
incarceration
must end.
Also, many drug offenses thatcarry
mandatory jail time could be changed
to carry mandatory community
service that actually benefits the
community they harmed. And not
only that, but it would also cost
significantly less. There are countless
options of punishments that would
still make life difficult for offenders
that wouldn't run up the bill and
would be more effective in creating
fever repeat offenders.
The biggest barrier to change is
the fact that our prison system has
become increasingly privatized.
This has incentivized keeping more
criminals locked up for longer, suck-
ing away funds that again could be
used for a better purpose. The U.S.
imprisons more people than any other
country in the world because of this
system, so it's obvious that new regu-
lations are needed in order to stop
this from spiraling out of control.
While I admit what I've laid out is
not concrete by any means, the era
of mass incarceration must end. We
can't continue to be trapped by the
past and romanticize the days ofAlca-
traz - even if "Lockup" does make for
interesting TV.

her first four innings while yielding
a single hit to Crummey in the third.
In fact, the Wolverines' first
runner in scoring position came
with two outs in the fifth inning
when freshman shortstop Sierra
Lawrence - who reached on a
fielder's choice - stole second base.
"(Walker) did a great job
pitching," Romero said. "It didn't
fall in our favor. She did a good
job mixing up speeds. She's one
of the slowest pitchers we saw, so
we just had to adjust."
After scattering three hits
through the first five innings,
pitching to contact caught up with
Driesenga. The drop-ball pitcher
allowed four hits in the frame en
route to all four earned runs.
"The game plan was the same,"
Driesenga said. "Just go right at
them and trust the defense, trust
myself and trust the movement on
my pitches. I mean, there is a lot."
Despite the loss, this Michigan
team - including its departing
seniors - will remember this
season fondly. This year's team

Hutchins took over.
"Obviously, we didn't
accomplish our full goal, but I
mean, I couldn't ask to be with a
better group of girls," said senior
second baseman Ashley Lane.
"Yeah, we fought. We fought this
entire year in this tournament.
I'm happy. I'm happy with what
we did. My emotions? They're
all over the place, but just mostly
because I just don't want to be
done. I just don't want to be done
playing this sport with these girls
next to me with this coach."
Added Hutchins: "They'll
remember that they committed
to all the values of this program,
and they committed to Michigan,
and they have sacrificed a lot of
their own personal things to be a
part of this great team. Those are
the lessons that take them to the
next level in their life. They're a
part of something bigger than
themselves, and they just do a
fantastic job of it."

said. "But life is a spectrum; it
has high highs and low lows. 'The
Kings of Summer' is funny but also
really heartbreaking. One of the
things I was really interested in
was if I could take lyrical impres-
sionism and ethereal elements of a
Terrence Malick movie and mash
that straight up with crazy weird
comedy. I think those visual com-
ponents are what people will real-
ly respond to."
Vogt-Roberts described how
the meshing of comedy and drama
allows the message of the film
to reach the audience at a much
deeper level than simply focusing
on one genre.
"By the time Joe (Nick Rob-
inson, TV's "Melissa & Joey") is
gutting a rabbit, or he's heartbro-
ken, you can ping-pong between
emotions, and the audience knows
that it's okay to laugh in these
heavy moments without taking
away from the dramatic tension of
the plot," Vogt-Roberts said. "It's
really easy to cross the line where
they're laughing in the wrong way,
soit's about guiding them in a way
so that the fact that they're laugh-
ing makes those moments more
cBs FILMS powerful."
He cited other films like "Sil-
ver Linings Playbook" and "Annie
Hall" that took risks and played
with conventions to set them-
selves apart from other films
based on the same archetypal plot.
Vogt-Roberts had the same inten-

"You've already seen coming-

said. "There's naturally a heavy
weight around that."
But all he wanted was to ensure
that the eventual final cut of "The
Kings of Summer" represented
his, and the cast and crew's, best
work thus far.
"It's about taking risks and bet-
ting on yourself and your team

said. "I said to my DP (Director of

Vogt-Roberts
discusses the making
of his debut film
By CARLY KEYES
Daily Arts Writer
While certainly no stranger to
the director's chair, Jordan Vogt-
Roberts (TV's "Mash Up"), who
has gained noto-
riety for his work W

commercials Of Summer
and television Jordan
programs, com-
mandeered his Vogt-Roberts
first full-length In Theaters
feature with June7th
"The Kings of CBS films
Summer," a mod-
ern-day coming-
of-age story that hits theaters on
June 7th.
The Michigan Daily sat down
with the Royal Oak native to dis-
cuss the making of the movie, an

official selection from this year's
Sundance Film Festival.
The cast includes an array
of actors, some whom are well-
known and others whom Vogt-
Roberts deemed "on the rise."
"You may not recognize a lot of
(the cast) yet, but many smaller
roles and cameos are incredible
stand-ups, improvisers and actors
that I think people will be seeing
much more of soon," he said. "Nick
Offerman (TV's "Parks & Rec"),
Megan Mullally (TV's "Children's
Hospital") and Alison Brie (TV's
"Community") are all friends I
know from the comedy world in
L.A."
Selecting the right actors to play
the trio of teenage boys who, suf-
focated by their parents' watchful
eyes and rigid rules, decide to run
off into the woods and build their
own house to call home, was a bit
more of a challenge.
"No one watches 'The Goonies'
or 'Stand By Me' and says, 'Wow,

Roberts said. "They're all fucking
