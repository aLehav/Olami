CELEBRATING OUR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH YEAR OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Kevin Hegarty, 

UT-Austin official, 
to succeed interim 
chief Doug Strong 

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

In April 2014, Tim Slottow, 

who served as executive vice 
president and chief financial offi-
cer, left the University to become 
the president of University of 
Phoenix. Ten months later, his 
official replacement has been 
chosen.

Kevin Hegarty, the University 

of Texas at Austin’s current vice 
president and chief financial offi-
cer, will be Slottow’s successor, 
also replacing interim executive 
vice president and CFO Douglas 
Strong, according to a release on 
the UTA website. Hegarty has 
served as UTA’s CFO for 14 years.

“My recommendation of Mr. 

Hegarty follows a successful and 
competitive search process,” Uni-

versity President Mark Schlissel 
wrote in an e-mail to faculty and 
staff Monday. “I thank the mem-
bers of the search committee for 
their thorough efforts leading to 
this outstanding recommenda-
tion.”

Schlissel also thanked Strong 

for his work as interim CFO in the 
e-mail, adding that the Univer-
sity Health System would “look 
forward to welcoming him back.” 
Strong previously served as the 
chief executive officer of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Hospitals and 
Health Centers, and will return 
to this position when Hegarty 
takes office.

Hegarty will leave his post 

at UTA on Feb. 26 and begin his 
position at the University on 
April 6. The University’s Board of 
Regents will vote to approve his 
appointment at their regularly 
scheduled monthly meeting this 
Thursday, according to their Feb-
ruary agenda. The contract will 
run through 2020.

Bill Powers thanked Hegarty 

Research suggests 
connection between 

social standing 

and sexual assault

By RACHEL PREMACK

Daily Staff Reporter

Sociology 
Prof. 
Elizabeth 

Armstrong 
said 
Whitney, 
a 

pretty sorority girl, snubbed her. 
This incident was not during 
Armstrong’s college years, but 10 

years ago when she was studying 
peer culture among freshman 
girls at Indiana University.

“I always said, ‘I feel like the 

biggest loser around Whitney,’ ” 
Armstrong said with a smile. “In 
general I felt totally over feeling 
intimidated by the popular girl I 
never was, but she is something 
else. It was very disconcerting 
for me to feel like I was right 
back in that space.”

If Armstrong, then an assis-

tant professor at Indiana Univer-
sity, felt ostracized by the pretty 
rich girls during the course of 

her research, it is hardly a shock 
that her study’s findings reflect-
ed how social status in college 
drives student choices on party-
ing. Status even plays a role in 
sexual assault on campus, she 
said.

Armstrong’s talk in a small 

room in the LSA Building Mon-
day concerned the influence of 
“status anxiety” on drinking, 
hooking up and sexual assault 
among undergraduates.

Indiana University is a large 

Midwestern college with a tradi-
tion of sports and Greek life. She 

and her research partner, Laura 
Hamilton, studied interactions 
at a women’s hall in a freshmen 
dorm. They observed the young 
women study together, talk and 
drink before parties, and con-
ducted interviews with many of 
these women in the four years 
following their dorm experience.

What she found is detailed 

in her 2013 book, “Paying for 
the Party.” Wealthy freshman 
women were able to rush Greek 
life and pursue academic success; 
after college, they could thrive 

Local officials, 
councilmembers 
consider options to 
alleviate challenges

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

For the city’s homeless, staying 

warm has higher stakes as wind-
chills dip well below zero.

Last week, a 39-year-old man 

was found dead in a tent near the 
Amtrak station on Depot Street, 
according to the Ann Arbor Police 
Department.

In an e-mail to Ann Arbor City 

Council members, Police Chief 
John Seto said the Washtenaw 
County medical examiner has 
not yet determined the cause of 
death.

“Although the medical exam-

iner has not yet released a final 
determination 
for 
the 
cause 

of death, it does not appear at 
this time that exposure was the 
cause,” he wrote.

Police said the man did not 

have a house, and was living in a 
tent west of the long-term parking 
lot and north across the tracks in 
the woods near the river. Though 
police said there was a heating 
source in the tent, the heat was 
not turned on.

This incident sheds light on the 

challenges for Ann Arbor’s home-
less population during the winter 
season.

In recent weeks, homeless-

ness has sparked debate at several 
Council meetings.

There have been efforts to 

recall Councilmember Stephen 
Kunselman (D–Ward 3) from his 
position in response to comments 
he made last year calling for the 
eviction of a homeless tent com-
munity near Burton Road.

Kunselman 
responded 
to 

these efforts at a review hearing 
in early January, explaining the 
need for a long-term approach to 
housing the homeless during cold 
weather.

“No one in the city of Ann 

Arbor, in the county of Washt-
enaw, should be left out in the 
cold or should be encouraged to 
live in the cold, to be given a tent 
and a sleeping bag and told to 
rough it and try to survive in the 
subzero, harsh Michigan winter,” 
he said.

Council has since revised legis-

lation in response to the conver-
sations. A resolution now states 
that, though humane displace-
ment of homeless camps on both 
private and public property is an 
appropriate response to private 
property and resident complaints, 
“it is not the practice of the City 
of Ann Arbor to proactively seek 
out homeless camps for removal, 
nor to broadly deploy strategies 
to render areas used as campsites 
unusable.”

Amanda Carlisle, executive 

director of the Washtenaw Hous-
ing Alliance, said the prevalence 
of tent communities in Ann Arbor 
is not a result of a lack of resourc-
es for the homeless, but rather a 
reflection of the homeless’ resis-
tance to entering shelters.

“We’ve put a lot of resources 

actually into shelter and specifi-
cally warming centers so that we

‘The Team’ selects 
two LSA students 
to appear on ballot 
for top positions

By EMILIE PLESSET 
and TANAZ AHMED

Daily News Editor 

and Daily Staff Reporter

With Central Student Gov-

ernment 
elections 
nearly 
a 

month away, campaign organiz-
ers announced on Monday the 
formation of The Team, a new 
political party.

LSA junior Will Royster will 

head the ticket as the party’s 
presidential 
candidate. 
LSA 

sophomore Matt Fidel, a current 
LSA representative, will serve as 
Royster’s running mate and The 

Team’s vice presidential candi-
date.

LSA junior Jacob Abudaram, 

The Team’s campaign manager, 
said the new party is composed 
of several current representa-
tives from the parties forUM, 
which will fold at the end of the 
academic year, and Make Michi-
gan, as well as students with 
no prior student government 
involvement.

Royster is currently academic 

concerns chair for the Black 
Student Union and has no prior 
experience on CSG. He said The 
Team is trying to represent stu-
dents from all parts of campus 
to ensure an inclusive campus 
environment.

“I wanted to use my voice 

and my talent to help the cam-
pus on another scale,” Royster 
said. “Really a place like CSG is 
a place where you have a number 

of opportunities to help people.”

Abudaram said several cur-

rent Make Michigan members 
are now involved with The 
Team.

LSA junior Meagan Shokar, 

who ran for CSG vice president 
on last year’s Make Michigan 
ticket with CSG President Bobby 
Dishell, a Public Policy senior, 
has departed that party for The 
Team. She will serve as The 
Team’s outreach chair.

Though Make Michigan cap-

tured the top two executive 
offices, Shokar stepped down 
in August, citing an injury and 
subsequent medical treatment. 
CSG later appointed LSA senior 
Emily Lustig to assume the vice 
presidency after Shokar’s depar-
ture.

Shokar explained her decision 

to leave Make Michigan for The 

More than 4,000 
signatures logged 
to protest dates 
for winter break

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

More than 4,000 peo-

ple have signed a petition 
demanding the University to 
change its 2015-2016 academ-
ic calendar, which currently 
schedules Fall 2015 exams to 
end Dec. 23 and the Winter 
2016 semester to begin Jan. 6.

The 
petition, 
posted 

through the Central Student 
Government’s 
UPetition 

website, says in its descrip-
tion that the current sched-
ule would inconvenience the 
University’s out-of-state stu-
dents.

“For out-of-state students, 

this would require flying 
home on Christmas Eve, not 
only causing an obstruction 
of a religious holiday, but also 
causing an extreme increase 
in flight prices — most by hun-
dreds of dollars,” the petition 
reads.

By contrast, the Fall 2014 

semester ended Dec. 19, with 
Winter 2015 classes com-
mencing Jan. 7. The 2015-
2016 Winter Break will be 
shorter than the 2014-2015 
Winter Break by five days if 
the academic calendar goes 
unchanged.

Helping in Honduras

DAVID SONG/Daily

LSA senior Leela Denver reads her poem during 
Cafe Shapiro at Shapiro Undergraduate Library on 
Monday.

POETICS

LSA sophomore Wyatt Frank is 

president and founder of the Uni-
versity’s chapter of Students Help-
ing Honduras. Since forming last 
semester, the organization has fun-
draised money to help build schools 
in Honduras and empower youth 
through education.

What is SHH?

Students Helping Honduras is a 

nonprofit organization that works to 
combat extreme gang violence and 
poverty in Honduras through educa-
tion and youth empowerment.

When and why did you found 

the organization?

I founded this chapter over the 

summer after a life-changing trip 
to Honduras for SHH’s annual 
Leadership Week. 

How do you fundraise and 

who funds you?

We are solely funded by those 

generous enough to donate to our 
cause. We put a lot into our fun-
draising efforts and like to get 
creative. From “Bake(shh)ale Mon-
days” to our Thrift Shop clothes 
auction, to soccer tournaments ... 
anything is a possibility, and our 
group is always up to the challenge.

What types of causes are 

these funds put toward?

All of the funds go toward 

building and maintaining schools 
in Honduras. The fundraising 
is always specific to new school 
projects and the results are super 
tangible. Chapter members raise 
money for these projects in Hon-
duras, and then have the chance to 
work on those projects themselves 
during our seasonal service trips. 

What do you look for in new 

members?

Anyone who wants to be a part 

of our chapter is welcome. There 
is no specific type of person we 
“look” for, just anyone who wants 
to help and be a part of an awe-
some community.

Research uncovers additional 
pathways that cause obesity

Study finds 97 new 
genetic locations 
associated with 
body mass index

By SANJAY REDDY

For the Daily 

As obesity becomes an increas-

ingly prominent health condition 
in the United States, University 

researchers have made new dis-
coveries about the biological 
pathways that cause it.

In the largest genome-wide 

study ever, the Genetic Investi-
gation of Anthropometric Traits 
consortium of researchers ana-
lyzed more than 300,000 genetic 
samples and found 97 new genet-
ic locations across the genome 
that are associated with obesity 
and body mass index — triple 
the number of previously known 
sites.

This finding led researchers 

to believe obesity is much more 
related to one’s genes than was 
previously thought.

Elizabeth Speliotes, assistant 

professor of internal medicine 
and a senior author of the GIANT 
study, said if scientists can pin-
point the specific gene variants or 
proteins that contribute to obesi-
ty, then therapeutic interventions 
can directly target them.

Speliotes said the study could 

lead to a new era of “tailored” 
obesity care.

“We are realizing that many 

of the common diseases we aim 
to treat are caused by multiple 
different 
underlying 
causes,” 

Speliotes said. “So now we can 
understand what those causes 
are and better define them. And 
then hopefully in the future we 
can sub-classify people into what 
they are at risk for versus what 
the general population is at risk 
for.”

Currently, therapeutic inter-

ventions are often generalized to 
diseases. For example, the same 
medications are often prescribed 
to all patients suffering from the 
same disease. Outcomes from 
these interventions have not been 
very successful.

“Right now we don’t know 

what the exact causes are for 
different diseases, so a lot of the 
stuff we do is like shooting in the 
dark,” Speliotes said.

In a companion study, an 

international 
consortium 
of 

researchers led by Karen Mohlke, 
professor of genetics at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina School 
of Medicine, identified 49 sites 
in the human genome associated 
with the human waist-to-hip 
ratio.

Mohlke said the waist-to-hip 

ratio is often associated with 
obesity because most people with 
waistlines larger than their hip 
circumference have more vis-
ceral fat around their abdominal 
organs, making them susceptible 
to diseases such as type 2 diabe-
tes and cardiovascular diseases.

‘U’ organizations raise funds 
for Make-a-Wish foundation

 MStars competes 
against MSUStars 
for rivalry week 
charity challenge

By COLLEEN HARRISON

For the Daily

In the spirit of basketball 

rivalry week, students from 
the University and Michigan 
State University are compet-
ing to raise money for the 
Make-A-Wish Foundation as 
part of the third annual Col-
legiate Challenge.

Though the groups have 

already 
started 
accepting 

online donations, University 
students will begin a major 
fundraising push this week 
after 
Tuesday’s 
basketball 

game against MSU and will 
continue throughout the rest 
of the month.

This year, the University’s 

chapter of the national ser-
vice fraternity Alpha Phi 
Omega will combine fund-
raising efforts with MStars, 
the 
University’s 
Make-A-

Wish chapter. MSU’s Make-
A-Wish chapter, MSU Stars, 

will run the East Lansing side 
of the fundraiser.

All 
money 
raised 
will 

help the organization grant 
wishes for children with life-
threatening illnesses. Wishes 
include trips to Disney World, 
New York City or the Super 
Bowl, for example. APO and 
MStars will run donation 
tables at the Michigan Union 
and 
the 
University’s 
C.S. 

Mott Children’s and Women’s 
Hospital.

“We hope to make the event 

more known on campus and 
raise as much money as pos-
sible for the wonderful kids 
in our children’s hospitals in 
Michigan,” said LSA senior 
Andrew Short, Make-a-Wish 
Chair for the University’s 
APO chapter. “It is incredible 
to witness how much joy a 
wish can bring a child.”

Short said the Universi-

ty’s fundraising team raised 
$6,000 last year toward one 
child’s wish. This year each 
fundraising team is hoping to 
raise $10,000 to fund trips for 
two children.

“We work both in compe-

tition and in collaboration 
with each other,” Short said. 
“I’m excited to see what our 

efforts 
will 
produce 
this 

year.”

While table donations will 

last only a few days, online 
donation sites will stay live 
through the end of the month 
to give people a longer period 
to donate. Each team’s prog-
ress toward their goals can 
also be tracked online.

LSA senior Nicolette De 

Simone, president of MStars, 
said she hopes to eventually 
expand the fundraising com-
petition to include a basket-
ball tournament similar to 
MSU Stars’ kick-off fundrais-
ing event.

MSU senior Shadi Jam-

moul, MSU Stars president, 
said the MSU fundraising 
team is also trying to raise 
enough money to fund wishes 
for two children this year. 
While their campaign has 
raised about $4,000 so far, 
MSU Stars still need to raise 
about $6,000 to reach their 
goal.

“At the end of the week, 

the campus that raised more 
money will simply have brag-
ging rights, while the other 
will be further inspired to 
raise more next year,” Short 
said.

 “LET US DARE TO READ, THINK, 

SPEAK AND WRITE.”

DETROIT 
Federal judge will 
not order new trial 
for Chicago activist 

A federal judge in Detroit has 

denied a request for a new trial 
for a Chicago Arab activist con-
victed of lying about her role in 
two terrorist bombing deaths in 
Israel when she immigrated to 
the U.S.

Judge Gershwin Drain ruled 

last week that Rasmieh Odeh’s 
argument for a new trial lacked 
legal merit.

In his ruling, Drain said evi-

dence showed the Palestinian 
native illegally obtained U.S. 
citizenship by failing to disclose 
her conviction for the fatal 1969 
bombings in Jerusalem.

Israel imprisoned Odeh for 

life for her role in the bombings, 
including one that killed Hebrew 
University 
students 
Edward 

Joffe and Leon Kanner at a gro-
cery store. Odeh, 67, said Israeli 
authorities tortured her into 
confessing.

LOS ANGELES
False report of 
gunman causes 
panic in airport

About 
20 
passengers 
fled 

through emergency doors and 
onto the tarmac at a Los Angeles 
International Airport terminal 
Monday after someone wrongly 
announced that an armed man 
was on the loose, authorities 
said.

The “misinformed announce-

ment” apparently stemmed from 
a police pursuit of an unarmed 
driver, which ended outside Ter-
minal 2, LAX Police Sgt. Belinda 
Joseph said.

Police responded to an emer-

gency call around 9 a.m. that a 
man may be trying to commit 
suicide off airport property. 
They apprehended the man, 
and the fire department took 
him to a hospital for treatment 
of an unspecified condition. But 
“someone said that there was a 
man with a gun, which was not 
true,” Joseph said.

MOUNT CARBON, W.Va
Train derailment 
sends tanker of 
crude oil into river

A train carrying more than 

100 tankers of crude oil derailed 
in southern West Virginia on 
Monday, sending at least one into 
the Kanawha River, igniting at 
least 14 tankers and sparking a 
house fire, officials said.

There were no immediate 

reports of injuries. Nearby resi-
dents were told to evacuate as a 
state emergency response and 
environmental officials head-
ed to the scene about 30 miles 
southeast of Charleston.

The state was under a win-

ter storm warning and getting 
heavy snowfall at times, with as 
much as 5 inches in some places. 
It’s not clear if the weather had 
anything to do with the derail-
ment, which occurred about 1:20 
EST along a flat stretch of rail.

CAIRO, Egypt
Egypt bombs ISIS 
in Lybia, calls for 
action from UN 

Egypt bombed Islamic State 

militants in neighboring Libya 
on Monday and called on the 
United States and Europe to join 
an international military inter-
vention in the chaotic North 
African state after extremists 
beheaded a group of Egyptian 
Christians.

The airstrikes bring Egypt 

overtly into Libya’s turmoil, a 
reflection of Cairo’s increas-
ing alarm. Egypt now faces 
threats on two fronts — a grow-
ing stronghold of radicals on its 
western border and a militant 
insurgency of Islamic State allies 
on its eastern flank in the Sinai 
Peninsula — as well as its own 
internal challenges.

around you, but that’s not an issue 
on The Team,” she said.

Make Michigan has not offi-

cially announced candidates for 
this year’s election cycle. Repre-
sentatives from the party could 
not be reached for comment Sun-
day evening.

Abudaram said several forUM 

members are also running as can-
didates for The Team. Last year, 
forUM’s candidates failed to cap-
ture the CSG presidency and vice 
presidency, but secured several 
representative seats.

He said he hopes the new party 

will help move CSG away from 
problems 
with 
partisanship, 

which they’ve experienced in the 
past.

“We want to broaden our 

scope and move beyond this par-
tisan stuff that has halted CSG,” 
Abudaram said. “You can tangi-
bly feel it halting CSG this year, 

which is not OK.”

Abudaram said the new party 

is reaching out to many campus 
organizations to better under-
stand and implement solutions to 
issues on campus.

“We need CSG to be a place 

where the executives and the 
assembly recognize, ‘OK, I’m not 
an expert on this issue, but there 
are many people on this campus 
who are experts on this issue,’ ” 
Abudaram said.

He said CSG’s initiatives to 

prevent sexual assault on cam-
pus, for example, could benefit 
from 
increased 
collaboration. 

CSG and the “I Will” campaign 
partnered earlier this year to host 
workshops to educate students 
and raise awareness about sexual 
assault on college campuses.

“Campus is so diverse — it 

would be a bad idea to just assess 
what the campus needs based off 
what these big organizations are 
saying,” Abudaram said. “There 
are a lot of marginalized commu-
nities on our campus and we need 
to hear their voices and make sure 
their voices are heard and make 
sure their needs are addressed.”

“Kevin’s love for the Long-

The University’s executive 

vice president and chief finan-

A large part of the role focuses 
on managing the University’s

high of $9.7 billion this past 
year.

Before his departure last 

year, Slottow had served as the 
University’s CFO for 12 years. 
He launched numerous cost-
saving programs as the Uni-
versity faced a constrained 
financial climate, and oversaw 
the endowment when it reached 
what was then an all-time high: 
$8.4 billion for the 2013 fiscal 
year.

During his tenure, Slottow 

helped initiate measures such 
as strategic sourcing, a pro-

without the threat of student 
debt. Lower class students 
could not find institutional 
support, and they struggled 
academically and socially.

Monday’s lecture focused 

on the social component of 
Armstrong’s study.

Armstrong’s 
talk 
began 

by building a thesis that the 
freshman girls were con-
sumed by their social status. 
The girls who were popu-
lar in high school used their 
homecoming-queen 
tactics 

to maneuver their way into 
top sororities. Young women 
sniffed out who was cool and 
associated with only those 
chosen few.

LSA sophomore Shannon 

Stone, who attended the event 
Monday, said the research 
echoed her experience in 
Bursley Residence Hall. In 
her hall, almost all of the girls 
rushed sororities. Stone cur-
rently lives in a co-op, which 
she said she enjoys.

“They would all have din-

ner at the dining hall together 
and they would all sit at one 
of the circle tables,” Stone 
said. “Then they would like 
walk by and make eye contact 
and be like, ‘Oh my gosh, hi!’ 
But they would never invite 
you to sit down. And that was 
weird.”

According to Armstrong’s 

research, the obsession with 
status, in turn, reflected the 
choice to drink, who they had 
sexual relations with and how 
sex occurred — with or with-
out consent, with or without 
protection.

A freshman named Linda 

in Armstrong’s study did not 
drink. Armstrong said this 
choice, along with her lack of 
social savvy, eliminated her 
from the hall’s social scene.

“There is a group on this 

side of the hall that goes 
to 
dinner 
together, 
par-

ties together, my roommate 
included. I have never hung 
out with them once,” Arm-
strong said Linda told her. “It 
kind of sucks.”

Stone said drinking habits 

among Greek life members 
in her dorm were risky. She 
recounted one time where 
her hall’s bathroom was cov-
ered in vomit and caution 
tape — the latter from a “con-
struction 
worker”-themed 

mixer.

Sexual relations were held 

especially at the mercy of 
social status tied to Greek 
life, she said. Armstrong dis-

cussed a senior honors the-
sis conducted by University 
alum Dana Benyas in 2014. 
Benyas drew ties between 
Greek life and relationship 
autonomy.

One female college student 

Benyas interviewed said her 
friends were once astound-
ed that she passed on the 
opportunity to hook up with 
a member of a high-ranking 
fraternity.

“The next morning my 

friend was like, ‘Did you ever 
hook up with that kid?’ and 
I was like, ‘No’ and she was 
like, ‘But he was in (that fra-
ternity)!’ ” the interviewee 
said.

Another girl said the sex-

ual behaviors of higher-tier 
Greek life members are con-
tingent on status.

“It’s a hierarchy, so the 

(people) in the higher tiers 
have more power,” the inter-
viewee said. “They would 
think that they can just not 
use a condom if they don’t 
want to, especially if it’s a 
girl from a lower tier. It’s like 
her opinion doesn’t matter as 
much.”

Stone relayed a similar 

experience in her hall among 
her peers.

“I think Greek life encour-

ages such a dangerous envi-
ronment because of the huge 
emphasis on social status,” 
Stone said. “It’s basically — 
it seems to me at least — this 
elitist system where you have 
the top-tier frats and sorori-
ties and that gives them this 
insane sense of power over 
people below them both in the 
same-sex interactions and in 
terms of sexual assault.”

The interviews strongly 

suggested a link between 
Greek life status and control 
of sex, Armstrong said.

Armstrong 
said 
many 

top-tier sorority members, 
described 
as 
“beautiful, 

wealthy,” claimed to have 
had no experience with sex-
ual harassment. She said this 
suggests how assault, too, 
is contingent on status. She 
added that women in lower-
ranking sororities or unaffili-
ated with Greek life are more 
prone to sexual assault and 
considered lower status.

“Everyone is vulnerable, 

but not everyone is equally 
vulnerable,” Armstrong said. 
“The women who got into 
higher status sororities were 
more safe because the men 
knew that if they were dis-
respected, they could tell 
the rest of their sorority sis-
ters and that that could have 
major consequences for the 

fraternity guys.”

But the root of sexual 

assault at parties comprises 
more than social dynamics. 
Armstrong 
explained 
how 

universities create environ-
ments 
where 
fraternities 

— areas which young men, 
rather 
than 
universities, 

wield control — are one of the 
few places that freshmen can 
drink.

Sororities are banned from 

hosting parties by national 
chapters, and drinking is 
banned in dorms. For many 
freshman women who want 
to drink, fraternities are a key 
place to do it. This puts men 
and women alike at the risk of 
sexual assault.

“Students are having the 

most dangerous aspects of 
their social life in a place that 
university does not control, 
but they are university-spon-
sored organizations,” Arm-
strong said.

Fraternities can also pro-

vide transportation to par-
ties, set party themes and, 
most importantly, control the 
door and access to alcohol. 
That means young women 
come in and unaffiliated men 
stay out.

To fulfill the expectation 

of consuming alcohol, sex 
and drugs in college, fresh-
men must comply with fra-
ternities’ desires, she said. 
Their high status, Armstrong 
said, provides them “the 
opportunity to victimize,” 
though she said most men do 
not do this.

“In terms of where the uni-

versity is actually dumping 
resources onto a group of men 
and saying, ‘Hey, let’s give 
you the means and the oppor-
tunity. Let’s kind of give you a 
loaded gun, but don’t use it.’ ”

Eliminating fraternities is 

not an option in the opinion 
of many students and univer-
sities. One student mentioned 
she did not believe elimi-
nating 
fraternities 
would 

eliminate sexual assault, and 
Armstrong agreed. Others 
brought up how Greek alumni 
are often the biggest donors.

Nevertheless, 
Armstrong 

said fear of losing social sta-
tus discourages women from 
reporting 
sexual 
assault 

when it does occur. One 
young woman in a sorority 
said she woke up in a frater-
nity bunk one day naked after 
a night of heavy drinking. She 
does not know who assaulted 
her, and never reported it.

“I just got to school,” the 

young woman told Armstrong. 
“I didn’t want to start off on a 
bad note with anyone.”

do have the capacity to house all 
the folks who are living unshel-
tered,” she said. “I think the story 
is more so whether or not folks 
are willing to and able to come 
in and out from the cold, and into 
shelter, specifically whether or 
not they have a mental illness, or a 
substance use issue, or something 
that might be preventing them 
from feeling like they can seek 
shelter.”

In response to last year’s 

severely cold temperatures, the 
Washtenaw Housing Alliance has 
made more resources available 
to Ann Arbor’s homeless popula-
tion. Washtenaw County and the 
city are now funding an overnight 
warming center operated by the 
Shelter Association of Washtenaw 

County.

The warming center is held 

at three different Ann Arbor 
churches, with each church tak-
ing responsibility for one month 
during the months of January, 
February and March. A daytime 
warming center is also being 
operated in collaboration with 
the Shelter Association and MIS-
SION A2, an Ann Arbor nonprofit 
organization that advocates for 
the homeless.

In response to the political 

debates over tent communities 
in Ann Arbor, Carlisle said she 
would rather focus on the need 
for more affordable housing with-
in the city.

“If they were offered a place to 

stay inside, I think most of them 
would take that opportunity, but 
I just don’t think we have enough 
resources to be able to offer folks 
pretty barrier-free housing in our 
community,” Carlisle said.

gel created the petition as 
part of a group project for her 
Organizational Studies class, 
Activism, which, according 
to its course guide descrip-
tion, focuses on the “practice 
of democracy” and asks stu-
dents to review the “writings 
by scholars and practitioners 
of social movements, while 
at the same time requiring 
students to plan and engage 
directly in activism them-
selves.”

This specific assignment 

asks students to write an 
essay identifying a social 
problem that “affects the 
public interest” and “sketch 
a plan to mobilize politi-
cal forces to ameliorate this 
problem.”

Siegel said LSA freshman 

Luke Barwikowski originally 
pitched the calendar issue 
to the class last week. They 
joined four other students — 
LSA freshman Annie Boeh-
rer, LSA sophomore Molly 
Weiss, Kinesiology sopho-
more 
William 
McPherson 

and Art and Design junior 
Laura Maier — dubbed them-
selves “Crush the Calendar” 
and got to work. The petition 
wasn’t an official part of the 
project; they just wanted to 
test the waters.

“We said, ‘Let’s just try a 

petition. Let’s see if we have a 
following at all,’ ” Siegel said.

“This is just the starting 

point for us,” she added. “We 
have a lot of things ahead. 
This was, more than any-
thing, to figure out if this is 
something other people knew 
about. We realized that most 

people didn’t. That changes 
our next step.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Sydney 

Brown, who is from Las 
Vegas, said she signed the 
petition because she feels the 
shortened break will further 
constrain 
already-limited 

time to visit with her family 
during the school year.

“Seeing in the past, as I had 

one of the latest finals last 
year, and given the numerous 
amounts of flight delays and 
travel expenses and every-
thing ... that time adds up in 
regard to cutting out time 
from seeing your family,” she 
said.

She added that by the last 

days of final exams, out-
of-state students are ready 
to return home — and later 
exams would exacerbate this 
issue.

“I think overall, kids will 

do worse on finals because 
they are so homesick and just 
eager to get out, that it’ll just 
create a negative reaction 
among campus,” Brown said. 
“I know firsthand, when I 
had my final on (Dec.19) last 
semester, kids were already 
checked out, ready to go and 
just basically waiting to get it 
over with.”

The 
University’s 
Board 

of Regents is set to discuss 
the 2015-2016 academic cal-
endar at its February meet-
ing Thursday, per an action 
request submitted by Univer-
sity Provost Martha Pollack.

The resolution in place 

does 
not 
address 
Winter 

Break. Instead, it deals with 
potential end-of-year con-
flicts for April 2016.

Siegel said at least some of 

the six “Crush the Calendar” 
founders will be at the meet-

ing.

As is, the academic calen-

dar schedules Winter 2016 
classes to end April 19, “study 
days” for April 20, 23 and 24, 
and exams for April 21 and 22, 
and April 25 to 28. In this sce-
nario, the first day of exams 
would overlap with the first 
night of the Jewish celebra-
tion of Passover.

Furthermore, commence-

ment activities are set to take 
place from April 28 to May 1. 
The latter date coincides with 
Greek Orthodox Easter, or 
Pascha.

“As a non-religious, pub-

lic institution the University 
does not observe religious 
holidays, however we have 
made it a practice to make 
every reasonable effort to 
help students avoid nega-
tive academic consequences 
when their religious obliga-
tions conflict with academic 
requirements,” 
the 
action 

request reads.

Pollack’s 
action 
request 

also proposes that classes end 
April 18, one day earlier than 
scheduled, and exams move 
forward to April 20 to avoid 
overlapping with Passover. 
Additionally, the resolution 
states that “timing of gradua-
tion ceremonies will be modi-
fied” to accommodate Pascha.

Public Policy senior Bobby 

Dishell, CSG president, wrote 
in a tweet Monday eve-
ning that CSG is working to 
resolve the issue of Fall 2015 
semester dates.

“We’ve 
e-mailed 
admin 

to work to resolve the issues 
regarding next year’s aca-
demic calendar,” he wrote. 
“Make your voice heard.”

M

y family’s household 
income is $250,000 
a year, but I promise 

you I am middle 
class. I live in a 
$2 million dollar 
house, but I prom-
ise you I am still 
middle class. It has 
one story, doesn’t 
have a pool or its 
own movie the-
ater. It is a modest 
three-bedroom, 
two-bath.

I 
understand 

how it sounds to 
dismiss $250,000. I do not discount 
that I am from a privileged family 
that can afford more than just the 
necessities. Many University stu-
dents are also from well-off back-
grounds. In Fall 2011, 63 percent of 
the class of 2015 reported a fam-
ily income of $100,000 or more. But 
wealth is a relative measure in some 
respects. Because of the high cost of 
living in Palo Alto, I grew up middle 
class and I have found that my views 
on money sometimes differ drasti-
cally from those of in-state students.

The median value of a house in 

Ann Arbor is $274,400, and Ann 
Arbor is considered an expensive 
area of Michigan in which to live. 
On the few occasions I cross Main 
Street and enter “real Ann Arbor,” I 
am taken aback by the size of these 
houses. Most are two stories with a 
basement and attic and have large 
front and back yards. The average 
house price in Palo Alto is $2.3 mil-
lion and none are two stories. If you 
want a two-story house, you better 
have another million to spend. To 
put it simply, my house in Ann Arbor 
is bigger than my house at home.

Housing prices aren’t the only 

discrepancy. A 64-ounce fishbowl 
at Good Time Charley’s costs about 
the same as an 8-ounce Long Island 
anywhere in the Bay Area.

So even though I have money, 

I don’t relate to a lot of people 
here who do. California money is 
earned and spent in a very differ-
ent way than a lot of the wealthy 
families in the Midwest or other 
parts of the country. It’s almost 
Gatsby-like. Cali-
fornia 
money 

is 
new 
money, 

held by software 
nerds. They don’t 
dress in suits but 
in bad dad jeans 
and fanny packs. 
Money elsewhere 
in 
the 
country 

usually 
means 

suits and ties and 
generations 
of 

family holdings.

There are, of course, the insanely 

wealthy in California. Los Altos 
Hills, an area neighboring Palo 
Alto, is an example. Average home 
prices are around $4 million. These 
are the houses with pools, movie 
theaters and multiple BMWs and 
Teslas in the garage. But even in 
Los Altos Hills, I notice a sub-
tle difference in the way wealth 
 

is displayed.

Money is not used as a status 

symbol in the Bay Area, because just 
living in the Silicon Valley proves 
you can afford it. I never knew 
the brands of my friends’ clothes 
before I moved to Michigan. Before 
I came to Michigan, the only brand 
I knew of and also owned was The 
North Face. I didn’t care where 
they got their clothes or how much 

they spent and neither did they. We 
found clothes that fit our personal 
style everywhere from Nordstrom 
 

to Goodwill.

Once at Michigan I was accosted 

with the clothing I was supposed 
to know and be impressed by: Pata-
gonia, Lululemon, Hunters, Tori 
Burch and much more. If I com-
ment on someone’s outfit, they tell 
me who designed it. I wasn’t used 
to the pride people had in their 

clothes. 
My 

friends 
in 

Michigan 
have 
worked 

at 
minimum-

wage jobs for 
months, 
sav-

ing up to buy 
that one special 
item. I respect 
that 
kind 
of 

delayed gratifi-
cation, even if I 

do not fully understand the appeal 
of the specific reward.

Instead of expensive clothing, 

shoes and watches, the people I 
know from California spend money 
on travels and experiences. Music 
festivals and exotic destinations are 
at the top of their and my wish lists. 
My friend has a saying: “I would 
rather travel in rags than stay at 
home in Versace.

Out-of-staters are known to have 

money — how else could we afford 
the $50,000 tuition costs? But mid-
dle class is a varied group of people. 
What is deemed important enough 
to save up for and what some-
thing is worth in dollars can be 
extremely diverse.

I

n Michigan, we’ve become accustomed 
to walking into restaurants and stores — 
BTB aside — completely aware that the 

price advertised to us is six 
percent less than the actual 
cost of any item. At work, 
we’re subjected to hefty 
payroll and social security 
taxes (mostly at a net loss 
for us millennials), and soon 
many of us will be subject to 
health care taxes. On a broke 
college student’s budget, our 
monthly sales tax expendi-
ture could pay for a six pack 
(or two).

In May, voters in Michigan 

will decide whether to approve a one-percent 
sales tax increase in Michigan. This revenue 
could generate more than $5 billion in state 
revenue to be spent on our crumbling roads, an 
investment Michigan desperately needs. But as 
with most taxes, the sales tax’s negative effect 
on the poor is disproportionate. Before we start 
digging into the pockets of every living and 
breathing Michigander, we should consider 
tapping into the lucrative excise sin tax market.

Michigan already actively participates in sin 

taxation. Cigarettes in the Great Lakes state are 
among the priciest in the nation. A whopping $2 
is slapped onto every pack of cigarettes. Tough 
luck for smokers in Michigan, but not as bad as 
New York, where your Marlboro Menthols are 
taxed $4.35. Excise sin taxes like the cigarette 
tax also disproportionately affect Michigan’s 
lowest income residents, and yet they give us 
that warm and fuzzy feeling. Instead of pun-
ishing everyone, we’re taxing only those that 
choose to partake in activities that are seen as 
“harmful.” In 2011, Michigan brought in $2.3 
billion dollars of revenue from sin taxes. People 
love to smoke, drink and gamble, regardless of 
the legality, safety or cost. Illegal marijuana 
use, soon to be a $35-billion industry in the 
United States, is contributing nothing to Michi-
gan’s current state revenue.

Several counties in Michigan, Washtenaw 

included, have already relaxed penalties and 
even decriminalized the use of marijuana. Ann 
Arbor, widely regarded as Michigan’s coolest 
college town, has students celebrating Hash 
Bash every day of the year. University students 
can be caught bragging to their Spartan friends 
about avoiding pesky MIPs simply by walking 
across the street from their dorms before light-
ing up. In Ann Arbor, chances of getting caught 
are low, and if you’re of age, the penalty of being 
caught with marijuana is just a measly $25 fine.

The state of Michigan has already legal-

ized marijuana for medical use, and in 2010, 
Michigan generated $10 million in revenue 
from medical marijuana applications. Medi-
cal marijuana dispensaries are all over, fur-
ther proving a high demand for the stuff.

is conveniently located across the street 
from our very own Ross School of Busi-
ness. For now, don’t try to go in without 
your golden ticket: a medical marijuana card 
 

(approximately $100).

Ethics aside, there is clear demand for 

marijuana in Michigan, and for the most 
part, the supply levels are underestimated 
and under-taxed. Colorado’s recent legaliza-
tion of the recreational use of marijuana is 
a prime example of why voters in Michigan 
should follow suit. In 2012, voters in Colorado 
legalized the recreational use of marijuana, 
under the enactment of Colorado Amend-
ment 64. Under this law, adults over the age 
of 21 were legally granted the rights to grow 
six marijuana plants and possess up to one 
ounce of pot.

I asked my cousin Saul (his name has been 

changed for this column), Colorado native 
and an occasional marijuana enthusiast, 
how legalization had affected pot smoking 
 

in Denver.

“Now, instead of picking up from my guy, I 

go to a dispensary. It’s a little bit more expen-
sive, but not enough to change the amount 
I buy. About $4 more for one-eighth of an 
ounce ($44 versus $40). Since Denver is a big 
city, there are large dispensaries to buy it in 
bulk, and weed isn’t too expensive. In smaller 
mountain towns, weed is a lot more expen-
sive now than it was before.”

It’s clear that legalization has changed the 

way that people buy weed in Colorado.

If you stroll into a dispensary in Colorado, 

you don’t need a medical marijuana card, but 
you’re going to need your wallet. Marijuana 
sold for recreational use is slapped with a sin 
tax of almost 30 percent in Colorado, versus 
the 2.9-percent tax on marijuana purchased 
for medical reasons. While Saul’s demand for 
marijuana seems to be inelastic at the price 
level of $40 per one eighth-ounce, this is like-
ly not the case for those living outside Denver, 
or on a tighter budget.

As for life in Denver, “Nothing has really 

changed,”Saul said. “There are a lot of people 
moving out here, and since smoking publicly 
is still not legal (on a federal level), no one is 
getting too reckless. People are mostly just 
using it to enjoy outdoor activities.”

Stores in Colorado began selling recre-

ational pot in January 2014. At the end of 
2014, Colorado saw its tax revenues expand in 
a way that had previously been reserved for 
accountants’ dreams — $51 million in extra 
tax revenue from recreational use alone in 
2014, to be exact. Not the $5 billion Michi-
gan needs for our roads, but still a significant 
amount, and one which is expected to grow 
every year.

So maybe there’s a reason beyond lazi-

ness as to why stoners aren’t advocating 
and organizing more for pot legalization. 
According to the influence laws of supply 
and demand, marijuana use will actually 
decline if legalized in Michigan. Prices will 
go up, and Michigan will generate millions 
of dollars in tax revenue, which we could use 
toward investing in our roads. There’s really 
no reason for lawmakers or voters in Michi-
gan to fear marijuana legalization, unless of 
course, we’re worried that it will make pot 
too expensive.

You know that moment when you realize 

your sister gets away with sneaking out on 
a Saturday night while you are punished for 
the same actions? Your parents scold you 
for the same petty acts that your sister gets 
away with simply because you are the oldest 
— which naturally means that everyone pays 
attention to your actions more closely and 
that you are supposed to be a perfect role 
model for everyone else.

Believe it or not, the same applies 

 with Israel.

Now, imagine that you are Israel and Egypt 

is your little sister, who gets away from the 
scrutinizing media even though “she” carries 
out much harsher actions.

Egypt has recently begun working on 

the expansion of its Gaza buffer zone; it 
will now expand up to two kilometers in 
an effort to protect Egyptian citizens from 
terrorism within the Sinai Peninsula. With 
this expansion comes the displacement of 
hundreds of Gazan families in Rafah. These 
families were each given short notice before 
which they were to evacuate their homes in 
order to make room for this border expansion. 

It should be noted that Egyptian President 
Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi said that along with 
potentially building a new city, the families 
will receive some sort of compensation for 
their homes, yet the exact amount has yet to 
be decided.

Why the need for this expansion? The 

same reason for the Israeli-Gaza border: to 
help protect the Egyptians from terrorism 
stemming from Gaza. In this scenario, 
the Egyptians are facing a war against 
the fundamentalist Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis 
group — a new addition to the Islamic State. 
The Egyptian intelligence services had 
discovered that Sinai terrorists have been 
receiving weapons from the Gaza Strip to 
then use against Egyptians. In fact, a 1,200-
meter tunnel connecting Gaza with Sinai 
was discovered, through which smugglers 
have crossed; this tunnel was created by 
 

Hamas terrorists.

Egypt is trying to protect its citizens from 

the wave of terrorism across the Sinai, which 
has reportedly been fueled by Gaza. This is an 
effort that will subtly creep across the media 
unnoticed. However, when Israel tries to 

An unrelenting double standard

LINDSAY HURWITZ | VIEWPOINT

protect its citizens from the suicide 
bombings and war sprung upon 
them from Gaza, it’s scrutinized in 
the media for months. In fact, anti-
Israel activists both exaggerate 
the composure of the barrier by 
saying that it is entirely cement and 
claim that the barrier is proof that 
Israel is an apartheid state. Little 
recognition is given to the fact that 
this barrier is directly correlated 
with a decrease in suicide bombers 
who entered Israel, and that Israel 
is never the one to start rocket fire 
into Gaza.

Just as tunnels were found 

between Egypt and Gaza that 
were used for weapon smuggling, 
tunnels were found connecting 
Israel with Gaza – only these 
tunnels were used with the intent 
of abducting Israelis. Hamas had 
planned 
a 
massive 
murderous 

assault during which it would send 
200 fighters dressed as IDF soldiers 

into Israel to both capture and kill 
innocent Israelis. These tunnels 
were complete with a complex and 
intricate maze-like design through 
which hundreds of Gazans could 
freely and slyly enter Israel. These 
tunnels threatened the entirety of 
Israel’s security even more so than 
the rockets, as they added a means 
for several Gazan soldiers to enter 
into Israel in a surprise attack, 
murdering two IDF soldiers. Yet, 
when Israel began to destroy these 
tunnels and target the terrorists 
who entered the land with goals 
of demolishing Israelis, it was 
scrutinized in the media for its 
actions in Gaza. In fact, because 
Hamas hides among its people, 
innocent Gazan lives were lost 
during this time of the war.

Just as Egypt was protecting 

its people against the smuggling 
of weapons, so too Israel was 
protecting its people against the 

bombing and ground threats rooted 
in Gaza. The difference is that 
Israel is always the older sister: 
scorned for actions taken to defend 
itself even though other countries 
are doing the same. The measures 
that both countries have now taken 
should be appreciated for bearing 
the interests of the greater good 
of their nations. Yet Israel goes 
to great lengths to avoid harming 
innocent 
people 
and 
civilian 

lives — can the same be said for 
Egypt? The media needs to gain a 
little perspective.

It annoys every older sibling 

when they take the heat for matters 
their younger siblings get away 
with. Don’t let Israel take the fall 
for trying to protect its people 
when every other country is doing 
the same.

Real ‘Still Alice’

TV REVIEW

Julianne Moore 

gives a heartbreaking 

performance

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

You know the drill: another 

Oscar season, another heart-
string-tugging film about fight-
ing disease. “Still Alice” fits the 
bill for this year’s 
Oscar-bait, and, like 
this type of film usu-
ally does, comes out 
triumphant.

Linguistics 
pro-

fessor Alice How-
land’s 
(Julianne 

Moore, 
“The 
Big 

Lebowski”) concern 
over 
memory 
loss 

leads her to a neurologist, who, 
to her disbelief, sends her out 
with an alarming diagnosis of 
early-onset Alzheimer’s. For an 
academic whose work hinges on 
linguistic prowess and innova-
tion, admitting that she “can see 
the words hanging in front of 
(her) but (she) can’t reach them” 
comes as a cruelly ironic jab. For 
what are we but the sum of our 
memories, each one bubbling up 
to connect with the next? Gone is 
her teaching ability, her concept 
of time. Even the sharpness in her 
eyes dulls to confusion. Revolv-
ing, out-of-focus shots blur more 
intensely as Alice’s mental acuity 
wanes. In the vulnerable time of 
her diagnosis, Alice must plan for 
a future she fears, all the while 
plagued with the realization that 
she has already reached her cog-

nitive peak and will only sink 
downward. Rarely do we focus on 
how mentally taxing neurological 
diseases are on the perception of 
oneself and overall identity, and 
“Alice” does this well.

It could not do so without 

Moore’s performance, which is 
one that certainly lives up to the 
hype. Moore lifts what could eas-
ily be a one-dimensional charac-
ter and, layer by raw layer, sculpts 
Alice into someone real. Alice’s 
transition from poise to forget-
fulness isn’t a steep descent like 
she had predicted. Rather, it’s a 
meandering journey that takes 
her through denial, terror, love, 
concern, confusion and eventu-
ally, reinvention and reconsid-
eration of her own identity. And 
as the film’s title suggests, Alice 
retains her intelligence, warm 
heart and strength, just in a dif-
ferent way than she had been 
used to before. Moore injects life 
into “Alice” with every woozy 
smile, anxious panic attack and 
vacant stare.

The family network backing 

Alice boasts strong performanc-
es as well. Her daughter, Lydia 
(Kristen Stewart, “Twilight”), 
argues with her for the indepen-

dence to make her own life choic-
es and pursue acting rather than 
attend college. However, Lydia’s 
weariness toward Alice’s parent-
ing is lined with a fierce concern 
for her happiness. Lydia isn’t all 
annoyance, nor all unflagging 
support, but a lifelike blend of the 
two. Tentative steps to reach out 
sometimes work, but sometimes 
fall flat, and seemingly insignifi-
cant comments can spark argu-
ment. Stewart proves herself a 
remarkably diverse and mature 
actress with her work in this film. 
Alice’s husband (Alec Baldwin, 
“30 Rock”) also demonstrates 
a slightly detached style of love 
and support wherein he genuine-
ly attempts to comfort Alice, but 
sometimes misses the mark.

However, the rest of her fam-

ily life, from a city brownstone 
apartment to a heritage-ridden 
beach house and well-dressed 
children who support her uncon-
ditionally, 
leaves 
behind 
an 

overly saccharine taste. Perhaps 
the idea was to show how much 
Alice has to lose as a result of 
her disease and that yes, there 
are cracks in seemingly picture-
perfect lives, but it still comes off 
slightly akin to a Lifetime movie 
backdrop.

Though exciting, grandiose 

visions of escapism deserve their 
screen time, the sheer realism 
of “Still Alice” offers another 
important tenet of film: the 
wonder of seeing an ordinary 
life challenge reflected in art. 
Moore’s mind-blowingly vivid 
portrayal of a woman not only 
struggling with, but also bravely 
confronting her disease makes 
that happen.

What King & Queen 
B have in common

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

“Music should strike fire from 

the heart of human soul.” — Lud-
wig Van Beethoven 

“I’ve been sipping, that’s the 

only thing that’s keeping me 
on fire, we on fire.” — Beyoncé 
Knowles 

Freshly 
traumatized 
from 

Beyoncé’s crushing (yes, crush-
ing) loss to Beck at last week’s 
Grammy Awards, I had to trudge 
through a Musicology 121 exam 
this week. Channeling all my 
brainpower toward an intro class 
based on the theory that music 
is one of the great forces in our 
world proved to be no problem, 
of course. It was all Ludwig Van 
Beethoven’s fault; he was the 
issue. Unlike any other class, I 
couldn’t listen to Beyoncé while 
preparing for this exam. I had to 
listen to Beethoven. 

Beethoven wasn’t even cov-

ered on the test — we’d stopped 
in lecture after finishing his fifth 
symphony, which, much like 
Beyoncé’s loss, was deemed too 
fresh, too ripe for us to be tested 
on it. I wasn’t upset (I was a little). 
Classical music had always been a 
secret joy, one that had thrilled 
and confused me simultaneous-
ly. I wanted to hear it and learn 
about it, but the modern, wan-
nabe-cool-cat part of me wanted 
to listen to Beyoncé. Beethoven 
was irrelevant. Stunning, but 
irrelevant.

Nevertheless, while studying, 

I obediently subjected my ears 
to the romance of his symphony 
before flicking on any ’Yoncé 
tunes. After administering much 
abuse to the replay button, I got to 
thinking — Beethoven’s fifth and 
Beyoncé’s fifth, “Drunk in Love,” 
aren’t so different after all.

Duh duh duh dun. Duh duh duh 

dunnn. We all know that intro. 
King B’s grand opus to the world 
of classical music is ominous and 

intelligent, simplistic and revo-
lutionary. Not only did his 1808 
symphony break the boundaries 
of what the opening measures 
(and all measures, for that matter) 
of a symphony could be, it marked 
a personal triumph for Beethoven, 
whose impending deafness began 
to cripple his mental health. You 
can hear the struggle in the song — 
it’s aggravated at points, convey-
ing battle and a deep cry for help 
at others, and repetition is loud 
and rife. In the end, though, after 
layers of the central, quadruple-
“duh” theme are added, enhanced 
and beautified, the whole piece 
rejoices. What happens in the 
middle is just as interesting — the 
mood (and key) oscillates between 
eerie and cheery, and at about the 
four-minute mark, we hear one 
note repeated a few times by the 
strings, quite oddly and out of 
place. Surfboardt.

It’s impossible (nor would any-

one want to attempt) to capture 
the essence of Beyoncé’s “Drunk 
in Love” intro in text. But it’s still 
recognizable. Like Beethoven’s 
lead in, when we hear Beyoncé, 
our stomachs drop. As listeners, 
we know what’s coming, and we 
know it’s going to be great. Those 
first few notes — for Beyoncé, it’s 
eight — build and build as the 
song progresses with different 
synths and effects stemming off 
one another, all bearing that origi-
nal theme in mind. The verses 
are creepy and sexy, while the 
chorus is booming and celebra-

tory; it’s symphonic trap. And in a 
way, “Drunk in Love” is Beyoncé’s 
fifth — it’s historic, instantly rec-
ognizable, beloved by the public 
and arguably her best work. It’s 
also ominous and intelligent, sim-
plistic and revolutionary. Those 
samples, those eight notes, that 
subject matter — everything is 
atypical, in the best way possible.

Musical merit is a different 

story. Critics and time, more than 
anything, have hailed Beethoven 
as a genius, and his music is deep-
ly revered. Broadly, the same is 
true of Beyoncé. But technically, 
the true musicality of Beyoncé’s 
music — its complications, its 
intricacy, its traditional structure, 
its “genius” — comes nowhere 
close to that of Beethoven.

Where 
does 
that 
gauge 

come from, though? It’s almost 
engrained in us, as listeners. 
We may like both Beyoncé and 
Beethoven, but only one is “real” 
music. Society and history books 
and BBC documentaries and 
music teachers have planted that 
into us from birth. To them I say, 
try this on for size: If Beethoven 
was the Beyoncé of his time, what 
did his society and music teach-
ers tell people “real” music was? 
Probably the greats that came a 
couple hundred years before him. 
Yes, he himself was critically 
adored and respected during his 
lifetime. But then again, so is 
Beyoncé.

So we’re back to the drawing 

board — the act of listening and 
having our breath taken away. 
The fifth and the “drunk” fifth 
both conquer this latter feat, and 
you can’t help but marvel at each 
one’s modernity. Beethoven’s vir-
tuosity will always be as mysteri-
ous as it is essential, and Beyoncé’s 
pop innovation will continue to 
seduce our ears with its convo-
luted goodness. Both are, and will 
always be, worthy of our attention 
— surfin’ all in this good, good. All 
hail King and Queen B.

‘Kingsman’ delights 
in ultraviolent thrills

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

For The Daily

Much like director Matthew 

Vaughn’s 
2010 
film 
“Kick-

Ass,” “Kingsman: The Secret 
Service” portrays 
extreme violence 
with a perverse 
kind of glee. It’s 
total 
escapism, 

a self-aware spy 
film that discards 
strict 
logic 

and 
complex 

characterization 
to revel in the 
sheer lunacy of 
its plot.

Up-and-

coming British actor Taron 
Egerton (“The Smoke”) plays 
Gary “Eggsy” Unwin, a young 
man with a disregard for the 
law following his departure 
from the Royal Marines. One 
day, when Eggsy is arrested, he 
calls Harry Hart (Colin Firth, 
“The King’s Speech”), an old 
family friend who introduces 
Eggsy to Kingsmen. Kingsmen 
is the secret intelligence agency 
where Harry and Eggsy’s late 
father 
worked, 
and 
Eggsy 

agrees to follow in his father’s 
footsteps to become a spy.

At 129 minutes, “Kingsman” 

is a bit long for a fast-paced 
action movie because it crams 
a dozen plots into one film. 
A large section is devoted 
to Eggsy’s journey through 
Kingsmen’s dangerous training 
program, where he meets other 
young men and a woman, Roxy 
(Sophie Cookson, “Moonfleet”), 
who’s presented as a love 
interest, though the hints of 
sexual tension never build to a 
head. The film also touches on 
Eggsy’s desire to protect his 
mother and baby sister from 
his lewd, abusive stepfather. On 
top of all that, there’s Samuel 

L. Jackson (“Pulp Fiction”) as 
the film’s villain, Richmond 
Valentine. 
With 
some 
plot 

threads being dropped, others 
petering out and others being 
relegated 
to 
a 
mid-credits 

scene, the film feels overstuffed 
and unfocused.

Despite these issues, the 

film 
succeeds 
because 
of 

how undeniably fun it is — to 
the point that its problems 
are rendered almost entirely 
unimportant. 
Jackson 
plays 

Internet billionaire Valentine 
with hilarious idiosyncrasies, 
like an obnoxious lisp and a 
disgust for blood and gore, 
despite his love for wreaking 
havoc and provoking violence in 
others. Valentine’s insane plot 
involves solving overpopulation 
by triggering violent impulses 
in humans through their cell 
phones, so several scenes depict 
mass displays of violence as 
everyone attacks one another 
with a feral desire for death.

Vaughn 
shoots 
these 

Tarantino-esque 
scenes 
of 

brutality with dizzying speed, 
tilting the camera and making 

swift pans while still orienting 
the viewer in space so the 
action rarely descends to shaky 
cam. Hart is a fun character to 
watch, as several scenes allow 
him to basically go crazy with 
well-choreographed 
battle 

moves, and Firth portrays him 
as a fussy upper class British 
citizen whose deadpan delivery 
of profanity creates big laughs. 
Egerton too is an unexpected 
treat, a sort of audience surrogate 
who bubbles with sarcastic jabs 
and frank comments about how 
unbelievable everything is. Eggsy 
keeps his cocky persona likable 
with his sense of humor and an 
interesting quirk: He can’t stand 
to watch animals die.

In the end, “Kingsman” is 

primarily worth seeing because 
of how hilariously it basks in the 
glory of bloodshed. One third-
act scene in particular features 
an act of violence that, unlike 
some of the bloodier scenes from 
earlier on, depicts death as a 
fantastic rainbow of colors in an 
awe-inspiring climax. It’s pure 
insanity, which makes it the most 
fun spy movie in years.

Revolutionary satire 
‘Last Week Tonight’

By DREW MARON

Daily Arts Writer

Last Sunday, John Oliver 

(“The Daily Show”) and his team 
of writers came back on the air 
in full force by 
tackling corrupt 
pharmaceutical 
companies, 
a 

South American 
leader’s 
unhealthy 
obsession 
with 

internet trolls, the 
greatest 
eulogy 

for an American 
company ever and 
an apology from 
Oliver for the minor confusion 
of a hamster’s penis. This latter 
segment, 
Oliver 
states, 
was 

the result of an error he made 
last season when a picture of 
a hamster’s tail was mistaken 
for the hamster’s genitals. This 
was the only error Oliver and 
gang made last season, and it’s a 
comment on the dystopian state 
of modern news that Oliver’s 
team was more accurate in their 
reporting than Brian Williams 
and NBC Nightly News. 

As with last season, this 

week featured an exposé on 
some facet of the ever-eroding 
morality of today’s political, 
economic and social landscapes. 
Using the usual wit, intelligence 
and devilishly well-researched 
and well-crafted script, Oliver 
delivered a better treatise on 
modern 
day 
pharmaceuticals 

than most journalists. 

The eulogy for the recently 

bankrupt 
Radio 
Shack 
was 

hysterical in addition to being 
poignant 
and 
bitter. 
There 

was a melancholia to Oliver’s 
lamentation of Radio Shack’s 
demise that made the viewer 
think about the place these “big, 
unfeeling 
corporations” 
have 

in our national identity. No one 
should want big companies to 
go away just because they’re the 
ones in power. On the contrary, 
we need such companies to exist 
to define ourselves as a nation. 

Finally, 
the 
trolling 
of 

Ecuadorian 
President 
Rafael 

Correa showcased exactly how 
crazy and awesome a show can 
be when it’s uninhibited by the 
stringency of network television. 
Oliver called upon viewers to 
tweet disparaging comments at a 
foreign leader who is bullying his 
own people for doing the same 
thing — we should be thankful 

such a show is willing to take 
an impassioned stance against 
the corruption and tyranny in a 
world as toxic as the one we live 
in now.

“Last 
Week 
Tonight” 

continues 
to 
shine 
in 
its 

organization and the clear effort 
that goes into every single story. 
Whereas most late night shows 
scramble 
for 
content 
every 

night, “Last Week Tonight” has 
an entire week to organize its 
thoughts, arguments, segments 
and news stories to deliver a 
revolutionary 
combination 
of 

truth and satire. It’s such a treat 
to tune in every Sunday night 
and see what the “Last Week 
Tonight” crew has cooked up for 
us this week, and an indescribable 
pleasure to see such a fantastic 
experiment work and return 
for 
another 
season, 
with 

hopefully many more to come.

‘Bosch’ has issues

Amazon’s new 
series is distinct 
but derivative

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

With the critical success of 

“Transparent,” Amazon’s original 
programming earned a higher 
level of legitimacy. 
However, most of 
Amazon’s successes 
lie in shows with 
a unique blend of 
comic and dramatic 
undercurrents. But 
there’s no outright 
humor (except the 
occasional sarcastic 
remark) in “Bosch,” 
an 
adaptation 
by 
Michael 

Connelly of his own procedural 
novels that follow the titular 
detective. The series brings a 
dark, modern noir atmosphere 
to Amazon’s collection of shows, 
but it still has issues setting itself 
apart in the crowded field of cop 
shows.

Played 
by 
Titus 
Welliver 

(“Transformers: 
Age 
of 

Extinction”), 
detective 
Harry 

Bosch opens the show by tailing 
a suspected serial killer. The 
dark city streets slowly dim as 
Bosch pursues the man until 
the dirty yellows and oranges 
give way to shadowy blues and 
sudden 
torrential 
downpour. 

Bosch shoots the man, Roberto 
Flores (Roberto Montesinos, “We 
Bought a Zoo”), and Pandora’s 
box opens.

The series fast-forwards to 

Bosch’s trial for shooting Flores. 
Here, questions regarding the 

detective’s 
motives 
begin 
to 

arise. Former special forces and 
a known maverick within the 
department, Bosch is hardly 
approachable. He is a cop who gets 
stuff done, or as the prosecutor 
Honey Chandler (Mimi Rogers, 
“Two and a Half Men”) puts it, 
“an experienced, highly trained 
killer with a body count too 
large to remember.” The show 
holds off on giving a definitive 
answer to the question and places 
Bosch in ambiguous territory. 
Welliver, 
a 
strong 
character 

actor from acclaimed series like 
“Deadwood” and “Lost,” plays 
Bosch with the right amount of 
emotional barriers for mystery, 
enough sympathetic vulnerability 
and hints of sarcastic asshole 
so that it’s understandable why 
his superiors want him gone. 
One such higher-up remarks 
outside the courthouse, “I’m 
glad you didn’t settle Bosch. 
Such a pleasure watching you 
hang yourself.” Another advises 
him to “Join the 21st century 
with the rest of us.” The latter 
line encapsulates Bosch; he feels 
like a relic from a more brutal, 
bygone era uncomfortably placed 
in modern Los Angeles. Bosch 
himself says “I’m not worried 
about what I did. I know what I 
did was right. I’m worried about 
what the jury will think I did. 
Anyway, fuck it.” 

This isn’t to say Bosch is 

incredibly original in his own 
right. The influence from several 
of 
television’s 
former 
rough 

mavericks 
hang 
over 
Bosch. 

There’s the “screw you” attitude 
of Gregory House (“House”), the 
arrogant bucking of authority by 
Jimmy McNulty (“The Wire”) 
and the tortured pragmatism of 

Jack Bauer (“24”). These common 
traits reinforce that “Bosch” isn’t 
exactly new, and in some cases has 
been done better. The presence 
of actors Lance Reddick (“The 
Wire”) and Annie Wersching 
(“24”) serves as a reminder of this, 
and they surround Welliver with 
worthy talent.

“Bosch” feels neo-noir in its 

early episodes, which is its finest 
achievement. The city of Los 
Angeles at night is well-shot, 
pervading its cinematography 
with a sense of dark beauty and 
an underbelly of foreboding. 
Meanwhile, there are enough 
quirks to make the depiction 
stand out, like a shot of a 
passed-out Santa Claus. Even 
in high-class areas (ironically, 
where Bosch lives), there lurks 
a potentially violent side of the 
iconic city. Between the light and 
the dark, it’s in the shadows that 
Bosch feels most comfortable. 
Even when the department gives 
him a break to work on his trial, 
he finds a way to get back into the 
field, claiming, “I’m no good with 
downtime.”

Bosch’s 
detective 
work 

ultimately brings him to the 
skeletal remains of a young child. 
The case opens old wounds for 
Bosch, whose orphan upbringing 
is 
filled 
with 
violence 
and 

tragedy. The brutal scene is one 
of the main arcs and presents a 
challenge that Bosch wants to 
solve while he wrestles with his 
demons in court.

“Bosch” ’s distinct aesthetic and 

Welliver’s strong performance 
make the show worth seeing. But 
the series must shed the weight of 
spiritual predecessors in order to 
assert itself as a trademark series 
for Amazon.

Sex and stupidity sell 
in modern pop lyrics

By CLAIRE WOOD

For The Daily

In 2014, R&B star Jeremih 

scaled the pop charts once again. 
With his latest hit skyrocketing 
to number six on Billboard’s R&B 
Singles in America chart, the song 
was a definite success. We hear it 
everywhere — radio stations, frat 
houses, bars — still going strong 
months after its release date. 

“Don’t tell ‘em / Don’t tell ‘em / 

You ain’t even / Gotta tell ‘em.”

Considering 
his 
past 
hits 

(2009’s “Birthday Sex” and the 
2010 release “Down on Me”— both 
of which sport blatantly sexual 
titles), it comes as no surprise that 
Jeremih intimately beckons us in 
this recent serenade of his secret 
sex life. 

I guess Jeremih really wanted 

to keep his sex life on the D-L, as 
he repeats the phrase “don’t tell 
‘em” throughout the song 40 times. 
 

Granted, the star is conveying 

his 
song’s 
theme 
of 
furtive 

fornication quite effectively, but 
40 times? In fact, throughout the 
54-word chorus, Jeremih uses a 
smashing variety of no more than 
seven words. 

Now, here is where the question 

comes up: how on earth did 
Jeremih’s “Don’t Tell ‘Em” become 
a number one hit on Billboard’s 
R&B Singles?

We can’t lie: Our parents’s age 

really had it down. Big hits back 
then sported impressive lyrics 
that hit listeners square on. The 
Temptations’s release of “My Girl” 
in December of 1964 inspired 
America with words that the 
whole world knows: “I’d guess 
you’d say / What could make me 

feel this way? / My girl — my girl 

— my girl!” The three wholesome 
women of The Supremes rattled 
America with “Stop in the Name 
of Love,” singing the begging story 
of a broken heart. Gloria Gaynor 
belted out her single “I Will 
Survive” in 1978, boasting strong, 
defiant feminism with her lines: 
“Did you think I’d lay down and 
die? Oh no, not I! I will survive!” 

Throughout 
the 
decades, 

however, a pitiful transformation 
has occurred in a sort of prodigious 
degradation of lyrics. Recent pop 
releases have come out with some 
of the most atrocious rhymes, puns 
and choruses in the history of 
mankind. 

For example, Big Sean climbed 

to Billboard’s number one Ranking 
for Hot R&B and Hip-Hop despite 
Sean’s 
repeated, 
demeaning 

assertion that he will be abstaining 
from “fuckin’ with you, you little 
dumb ass bitch.” Notwithstanding 
the 
most 
shameless 
female 

objectification America has seen 
yet, Big Sean’s music video has 
raked in over 37 million views on 
YouTube.

If not blatantly offensive, these 

kinds of lyrics are unfathomably 
stupid. Rapper YG, featured in 

Jeremih’s “Don’t Tell “Em,” backs 
his statement of being “on my late 
night thirsty” with the substantial 
argument that, of course, “it was 
late night, and I was thirsty.” Good 
one, YG — excellent use of circular 
reasoning. Nicki Minaj comes out 
with a similar, insultingly simple 
line in her recent release “Only,” 
as she claims that she “don’t duck 
nobody but tape” and then follows 
with an explanation of how “that 
was a set up for a punchline on 
duct tape.” Was that our cue to 
laugh? Nobody knows. 

So how is it possible that these 

horrendous, empty combinations 
of verses climb their way to the 
top of the pop culture food chain? 

I have no clue. Maybe its 

Minaj’s artificial perfection that 
sells her albums. Maybe we’re 
intoxicated 
with 
the 
recent 

trends of throbbing bass and 
synthesized 
instrumentals. 

Maybe it’s the heavy eroticism 
that defines a song’s popularity, 
attractive to us as some form 
of vicarious fantasy. Maybe we 
actually like the lewd, asinine 
lyrics that inundate today’s Top 
40.

Or maybe we’ve all stopped 

listening.

YOUNG MONEY

Don’t tell ‘em your lyrics suck.

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

DKNY’s show opened with 

a backdrop of white text on a 
black background, posing the 
question, “What is New York?” 
Potential answers were pro-
jected throughout the show, 
including “New York is life, 
love and happiness” and “New 
York is the only place where 
you can be more. More cre-
ative, more adventurous and 
more importantly, yourself.” 
Though answers varied, by 
the show’s finale, we learned 
Donna Karan’s answer to the 
question: polished minimal-
ism, crisp, clean cuts and 
understated glamour.

The one-time “Queen of Sev-

enth Avenue” is arguably the 
essence of New York. As a life-
long native, she always reflects 
the city’s distinctive charac-
ter through her collections. 
Never failing to pay homage 
to the city that never sleeps, 
Karan stayed true to her sig-
nature style this season. The 
overarching minimalism of the 
collection was noticeable in 
not only the oversized sweat-
ers and coats, but also Karan’s 

use of a limited color scheme, 
consisting of mainly prima-
ries, camel-tones and black. 
Though sparse in color, Karan 
added small touches of embel-
lishment with sash-like strikes 
of glitzy beading strewn across 
button-downs and extending a 
gilded touch to the lapels and 
sleeves of the collection’s many 
coats.

Karan’s fall line is an accu-

rate depiction of New York 
itself, with various layers, few 
bold colors countering neu-
tral shades and inconsistent 
lines and structure mimick-
ing that of the city’s typical 
resident — brash and complex. 
The limited use of embellish-
ments and broaches topping 
off 
relatively 
conventional 

turtlenecks and button-downs 
reflects the city’s practicality, 
but also that bright beacon of 
hope New York is so often asso-
ciated with. Ankle-high socks 
embroidered 
with 
“DKNY” 

channeled schoolgirl vibes, yet 
crisp, clean loafers and chunky 
platforms denoted a graduated 
feel. Tinged with little chaos 
among the conventional, Karan 
and her expertise will always 
do the city justice.

Culture keys program

By BRANDON CARNEY 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

lacrosse team isn’t your typical 
program. In just their fourth 
year 
of 
competition, 
the 

Wolverines believe they have 
an opportunity to shake up not 
only the traditional mold of 
successful lacrosse programs, 
but 
also 
the 
landscape 
of 

Michigan athletics as a whole.

For Michigan coach John 

Paul, the identity of the program 
begins with its youth. Despite 
only winning five games last 
season, Paul has managed to 
bring in a top-10 recruiting 
class.

What’s surprising about the 

Wolverines’ meteoric rise up 
the national recruiting boards 
is how, by the numbers, it looks 
like Michigan is behind in 
almost every statistical category 
on the field.

In his first recruiting classes, 

Paul laid the foundation that 
made his program unlike any 
other in the nation in order to 
attract quality players. Perhaps 
more than any coach, Paul 
has relied on marketing the 
Michigan brand to prospective 
players more than the sport 
itself.

“Academics and the setting 

of Michigan has had a big effect 
on what we do,” Paul said. “The 
reality with lacrosse is we don’t 
have leagues you’re going to 
make millions of dollars playing 
in.”

Paul’s overall vision is to 

attract and develop players who 
are well rounded in everything 
they 
do. 
The 
scoreboard 

victories, Paul believes, will 
come as a result of victories 
around campus and in his 
players’ overall lives.

“You have a group of kids who 

are committed to overall being 

good people,” said freshman 
midfielder Parker McKee. “I 
think that’s shown through thus 
far and will continue to show the 
next four years.”

On the field, the Wolverines 

are still discovering who they are, 
and the ongoing development 
of Michigan lacrosse has been a 
real draw for players.

“No matter what sport you’re 

playing, tradition is important 
at Michigan,” said freshman 
midfielder PJ Bogle. “Being able 
to create the tradition and the 
culture within the first years of 
the program is special.”

Along with drawing recruits, 

the Wolverines are creating 
a program built around their 
current players. With a new 
stadium in the works and 
countless resources off the field, 
Michigan lacrosse is growing, 
and that’s something its players 
are excited about.

“Being 
a 
new 
program, 

everything 
Michigan 
did 

seemed 
very 
progressive,” 

McKee 
said. 
“Training, 

academic programs, facilities, 
everything’s new for us. We’re 
not falling into an old system 
that needs to be revamped. 

We’re jumping into something 
reaching 
for 
success 
right 

away.”

Though 
there 
are 
many 

opportunities available to the 
Wolverines’ talented freshmen, 
Paul has made it clear to the 
first-year class that time on the 
field is not a given. And despite 
an 
accomplished 
recruiting 

class, the young program still 
has many holes to fill.

But like he has done thus far, 

Paul will find a way to make up 
the deficit.

Behind every great team, 

there has to be a great coach 
getting all his players to buy in, 
and Paul does that just as well as 
anyone in the country.

It’s not every day a club team 

gets picked to become a varsity 
program, but with Paul leading 
the way, Michigan and its strong 
culture 
is 
already 
breaking 

the tradition of powerhouse 
programs by creating a tradition 
of its own.

“Coach Paul is definitely a 

visionary,” Bogle said. “I think 
this year and beyond, we’re 
going to turn a lot of heads and 
surprise a lot of people. We owe 
a lot of that to (Paul).”

John Paul has been a driving force in establishing his program’s culture.

Copp sidelined with 
upper-body injury

By JEREMY SUMMITT

Daily Sports Editor

The injury bug continues to 

come and go for the Michigan 
hockey team.

Michigan coach Red Berenson 

announced Monday that junior 
forward Andrew Copp sustained 
an upper-body injury in Satur-
day’s game at Minnesota and is 
doubtful to play in the Wolver-
ines’ upcoming series against 
Ohio State.

Copp was unavailable for com-

ment, but Berenson said Copp 
would be listed as week-to-week.

Though Copp’s injury will 

leave a massive hole at center on 
Michigan’s top line, senior for-
ward Travis Lynch is expected to 
return this week from a fractured 
wrist he suffered Jan. 10.

Lynch has been skating in non-

contact drills the past week, and 
Berenson confirmed he should 
be inserted into the lineup this 
weekend barring any setback. 
Lynch is an integral part of the 
Wolverines’ penalty-killing unit, 
and he has scored five goals as the 
team’s fourth-line center.

The senior won’t be the player 

to assume Copp’s role, but his 
return should certainly help bol-
ster what would have been a thin 
lineup if both players were absent 
from the line chart. Instead, 
Berenson said sophomore for-
ward JT Compher will return 
to center, flanked by sophomore 
forward Tyler Motte and a player 
to be named later on Michigan’s 
top line.

Copp has scored 13 goals this 

season to go along with 11 assists, 
good for 24 points in 25 games. 
Five of those 13 goals have come 
on the power play.

“The big loss right now is 

Copp,” Berenson said. “I mean, 
that’s a huge loss to our team, and 
we got to pick up the slack from 
that.”

He sustained the upper-body 

injury with 8:46 remaining in 
the second period of Saturday’s 
game. Copp dropped off a pass at 
the offensive blue line that was 
intercepted, springing Minneso-
ta’s Travis Boyd on a breakaway.

Copp bolted back to the 

Wolverines’ 
zone 
to 
stymie 

the Gophers’ scoring chance. 
Instead, he got tangled up with 
Boyd. Both players crashed into 
the boards, and it seemed that 
Copp’s left arm and shoulder had 
absorbed the impact.

After trainers tended to him 

for several minutes, Copp slowly 

skated off the ice at Mariucci 
Arena and headed straight for the 
locker room, holding his left arm 
tightly against his waist. After 
the game, his arm remained in 
that same position unwrapped 
and unstabilized.

It looked as if it could have 

been a long-term injury, but 
Michigan caught a break when it 
needed it most.

“Well, you never know. You 

never know,” Berenson said. “I’m 
glad it wasn’t.”

Senior forward Andrew Sinelli 

and senior defenseman Mike 
Chiasson are also recovering 
from minor undisclosed injuries. 
However, Berenson expects them 
to fully participate in practice 
this week.

Andrew Copp is unlikely to play in this weekend’s series against Ohio State.

Goree’s foul trouble hurts Michigan

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Writer

In a tumultuous season, the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team has shown that it fre-
quently lives and dies with its 
best player: senior forward Cye-
sha Goree.

The Wolverines’ best stretch 

of the Big Ten season — a 4-1 
January surge including wins 
over 
Penn 
State, 
Michigan 

State, Ohio State and North-
western — was fueled in large 
part by Goree’s 18.6 points and 
10.2 rebounds per game.

Over 
the 
entire 
season, 

Goree’s 14.4 points per game 
and 55.1 shooting percentage 
make her both Michigan’s lead-
ing scorer and its most efficient.

But in the Wolverines’ last 

three games — all losses, by no 
coincidence — Goree just wasn’t 
able to stay on the floor.

In the losses to Rutgers, 

Ohio State and Northwestern, 
Goree committed 13 total fouls 
and played just 26 minutes per 
game. Prior to the losing streak, 
Goree was averaging 33 min-
utes.

Without her, Michigan was 

unable to muster any semblance 
of offense or defense — in sepa-
rate second-half collapses, the 
Wolverines allowed a 12-0 run 
to the Buckeyes and suffered a 
six-minute scoring drought in 
a last-second loss against the 
Wildcats.

“Cyesha gets in foul trouble, 

and it just changes the dynam-
ics of our team,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “Even 
if she’s not scoring, she gives 
an inside presence, and that 
changes what teams do against 
us defensively.”

Goree’s inside presence is 

something no one on Michi-
gan’s roster can match, espe-
cially 
defensively. 
Senior 

forward Nicole Elmblad has 
stepped up her game as of late 
to make up for Goree’s extend-
ed absences. She has 22 points 
and 21 rebounds over the last 
two games, but the 5-foot-11 ex-
guard playing power forward 
can only do so much.

Beyond Elmblad, just about 

all of the Wolverines’ key 
players are offensive-minded 
guards, including senior Shan-
non Smith, junior Madison 
Ristovski, 
sophomore 
Siera Thomp-
son and fresh-
man Katelynn 
Flaherty.

And 
even 

when 
given 

opportuni-
ties to come 
out 
victori-

ous 
without 

Goree, 
those 

shooters haven’t been able to 
capitalize without her presence 
commanding attention in the 
middle.

“I thought we had some 

good looks, and we got to the 
line,” Barnes Arico said after 
the Northwestern loss. “And 
normally we make those free 
throws. ... (To avoid scoring 
droughts), you get people to stay 
out of foul trouble. You get peo-

ple to make shots.”

As 
Michigan’s 
only 
true 

post player, it’s unavoidable for 
Goree to pick up at least a few 

fouls per game 
— 
she 
has 

been whistled 
two times or 
fewer in just 
five 
games 

this 
season. 

But 
consid-

ering 
how 

depleted 
the 

Wolverines 
look 
without 

Goree, Barnes 

Arico wants to see fewer inci-
dents like the over-aggressive 
dive for the ball that brought 
Goree her second foul in the 
first half against Northwestern.

“It was the third or the 

fourth foul when she was hold-
ing the back of the kid’s shirt — I 
think that she has got to remain 
disciplined,” Barnes Arico said. 
“It’s extremely difficult because 
people are attacking her all the 

time, but she’s got to keep her 
discipline about her and not 
give up silly ones.”

At this crucial stretch of the 

season, Michigan needs Goree 
on the floor more than ever.

The Wolverines (6-8 Big Ten, 

14-11 overall) have just four 
games remaining before the 
Big Ten Tournament, and they 
may need to win all four and 
pick up multiple wins in the 
tournament to keep their fad-
ing NCAA Tournament chances 
alive. Michigan currently sits 
at eighth place in the Big Ten, 
meaning any conference tour-
nament run would likely have 
to go through No. 5 Maryland,

ference and beat the Wolverines 
by 26 at Crisler Center on Jan. 
29.

Unless Michigan proves it 

can score and defend without 
Goree in the paint, any more 
foul trouble down the stretch 
could spell doom for the Wol-
verines’ postseason aspirations.

Cyesha Goree has committed 13 total fouls and played just 26 minutes per game in Michigan’s last three losses.

she has got 
to remain 

disciplined.”

Friends on land, 
teammates in pool

By SYLVANNA GROSS

Despite knowing her for a 

little more than a year, fresh-
man Hannah Moore doesn’t 
have a shortage of good things 
to say about new best friend 
and teammate, freshman Clara 
Smiddy.

“We’ve 
grown 
so 
close, 

we’re practically sisters at this 
point.”

The pair has dominated 

competition for the Michi-
gan women’s swimming team 
alongside their breakout fresh-
man swimming teammates. 
Smiddy has twice been named 
Big Ten Freshman of the Week, 
and Moore has consistently 
out-touched opponents. Most 
recently, Moore took second 
in both the 500-yard and 100-
yard freestyle in the dual meet 
against Ohio State on Jan. 24.

When Smiddy signed last 

year, Moore was quick to get 
in contact with someone she 
had only vaguely known about 
through elite youth swimming 
circles.

“I heard of (Smiddy) and 

knew she was a really talent-
ed swimmer, so when I found 
out we had both committed, 
I got her number and texted 
her immediately,” Moore said 
“But technically, we first met 
at Winter Junior Nationals last 
year.”

And according to Smiddy, 

they have been best friends 
ever since.

Over the past year, the 

power couple has raced not 
only together in Michigan, but 
also at the Youth Olympics in 
Nanjing, China over the sum-
mer.

“It’s good to have some-

one in college who has been 
through the same experienc-
es,” Smiddy said.

Moore says she and Smiddy 

were practically inseperable 
when they were abroad. They 

also bonded with future team-
mate, freshman PJ Ransford, 
in China.

Middy and Moore agreed 

that the atmosphere in Nanjing 
was subpar compared to the 
intensity at Canham Natatori-
um where there meets are loud 
and raucous.

And both definitely agree 

that Michigan has comple-
mented the bond that they 
have formed, with the two 
seamlessly transitioning from 
teammates in the pool to best 
friends and roommates on 
land.

“A lot of the times we’ll just 

sit next to each other and study 
and just enjoy each other’s 
company,” Moore said. “So 
it’s not all swimming talk all 
the time … but there is plenty 
of swimming talk. I don’t feel 
like we even compete against 
each other, because we’re both 
so happy if the other one does 
well.”

The obvious camaraderie 

between the two Wolverines is 
emphasized by their ability to 
finish each other’s sentences, 
their joy at the other doing well 
in a competition and, weirdly, 
their sleeping habits.

They tend to wake up at the 

exact same time in the middle 
of the night, and because of 
their grueling practice sched-
ule, their bodies have become 
programmed to wake up natu-
rally at 5:30 a.m. almost every 
day. The friends find the early 
wake-up funny but annoying.

They spend almost every 

second outside of class togeth-
er. Moore is pursuing the sci-
ences, 
whereas 
Smiddy 
is 

focusing on social sciences.

“Surprisingly, we get along 

really well,” Smiddy joked.

And even though the two 

won’t be rooming together 
next year, they still plan on 
seeing each other every day.

“Let’s face it,” Smiddy said. 

“Nothing will change.”

Behind Enemy Lines: Michigan State coach Tom Izzo

Izzo discusses 
in-state rivalry, 
Dawson, one-and-

done rule

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Just over two weeks after a 

76-66 overtime loss to Michigan 
State in East Lansing, the 
Michigan men’s basketball team 
gets another crack at its in-state 
rival 
Tuesday 
night. 
The 

Spartans venture to Ann Arbor 
for a 9 p.m. tip-off at Crisler 
Center, the latest installment in 
a rivalry series that saw more 
parity in the last three seasons 
than it had in decades.

On Feb. 1, the Wolverines 

couldn’t finish the job after 
senior forward Max Bielfeldt’s 
last-second 
tip-in 
sent 
the 

game to overtime. Tuesday’s 

matchup could be just as close, 
considering 
the 
Wolverines 

hold home-court advantage and 
haven’t lost to 
the 
Spartans 

at 
Crisler 

Center 
since 

January 
26, 

2010.

The 
Daily 

sat down with 
Michigan 
State 
coach 

Tom Izzo in 
October at Big 
Ten 
Media 

Day in Chicago to talk about 
Spartans star Branden Dawson, 
the prevalence of the one-
and-done in big-time college 
basketball and the evolution of 
the Michigan-Michigan State 
rivalry in recent years.

The Michigan Daily: 
Is 

Branden (Dawson) ready to 
take the next step and become a 
prime-time player?

Tom Izzo: Not only do I 

think he’s ready, but he has to be 
ready. If we’re gonna be great, 
Branden Dawson has got to take 

a major step. 
But 
I 
think 

he’s capable of 
it. I think he 
proved it the 
last six or eight 
games of last 
year, I think 
he 
proved 

it 
at 
times 

throughout 
… he’s trying 
to do what I 

tried to do when I got this job: 
“Can I stay consistent?” That 
doesn’t mean that every game 
you’re going to get 20 (points), 
but can I be consistent on a 
night-in, night-out basis? If he’s 
consistent and plays with a high 
motor and high energy, I think 
the work he did this summer, 
he’s going to become a star, 
which he should be. So he needs 
to for us, he needs to for himself. 

That’s a pretty good deal when 
both people benefit from how he 
plays.

TMD: With one-and-done 

and the world we live in, when 
did you realize that you had to 
start recruiting players who 
might not see themselves at 
Michigan State after playing 
one or two seasons in college?

TI: My thing has never 

changed. It wasn’t as talked 
about then — they just weren’t 
coming out as often then. 
(Jason) Richardson, you know, 
was a one-(year) or two-(year) 
kid, and he did come out after 
two years. But it wasn’t the 
norm back then, but I’ve never 
changed.

In this day and age, the 

guys that think they’re ready 
to leave early … I mean, you 
(addressing 
the 
reporter 
in 

jest) would have been out your 
first year. Seriously. I’m not 
saying you would have made it, 
all kidding aside. But that’s the 

mentality now. And the other 
sad mentality is if you’re a junior 
or a senior, it hurts you. That’s 
the saddest of all.

But as far as going after one-

and-done guys, the only thing 
I would prefer is to have a guy 
that wants to come to win a 
championship and let that lead 
to being done, not come in on an 
eight-month contract.

But taking one-and-done guys 

and this fallacy that I don’t want 
a one-and-done guy or I don’t 
want a guy who’s going to leave 
after a year … I’ve said it to our 
media, I’ve said it to everybody: 
unfortunately, kids leaving early 
is worth more than winning a 
national championship. So why 
wouldn’t a coach want them to 
leave early if they could?

Some coaches don’t care if 

they leave early and fail. I do … 
it’s a different animal. I call it 
the Twitter generation.

TMD: In terms of the in-state 

rivalry with Michigan, how 

do you see the dynamic being 
different last year as opposed to 
the last few?

TI: I think we both lost a lot of 

players, and yet we’ve both got 
some key, good players coming 
back. It became a rivalry — now 
it is a rivalry. It was a five-year 
non-rivalry on our part and a 
10-year non-rivalry on their 
part, and now it’s a rivalry. Now 
both teams are good, games 
are good. I see that continuing. 
John Beilein’s a good coach, 
they’ve upgraded their facilities 
a lot, they’ve put some emphasis 
on basketball for the first time 
in a while, and they’re getting 
dividends paid from that. But 
we’re not going anywhere.

TMD: Do you see Michigan 

as being one of the Big Ten’s 
more difficult venues to play in?

TI: It’s getting there. It is. 

They’ve done a great job with 
the arena. And I think their 
fans, they’ve taken major steps 
from where they were.

Michigan State coach Tom Izzo thinks his team’s rivalry with Michigan is as strong as it has ever been.

major steps.”

Despite down year, rivalry game still brings heat

Michigan State 
matchup presents 

opportunity in 

Michigan’s season

By DANIEL FELDMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Just because the Michigan 

basketball team is having a 
down season doesn’t mean that 
its rivalry with Michigan State 
has lessened. If anything, it has 
become more intense.

After losing in East Lansing to 

begin February, the Wolverines 
(6-7 Big Ten, 
13-12 
overall) 

will host the 
Spartans 
on 

Tuesday night 
in 
another 

round 
of 

what 
has 

become 
one 

of the biggest 
rivalries 
in 
college 

basketball.

With 

Michigan 
currently 
sitting on the 
outside looking 
in at a potential postseason 
berth, the game represents more 
than just a simple rivalry game 
for the Wolverines.

“We need it to keep our season 

alive,” said junior guard Spike 
Albrecht. “We’ve got to protect 
home. We’ve done a good job at it 
in years past, so we’ve got to make 
sure we take care of business 
down the stretch this season.”

In the midst of a four-

game losing streak, this marks 
Michigan’s chance to get back 
on the right track and potentially 
save a postseason bid, albeit to the 
NIT. On top of that, though, is the 
threat of Michigan being swept 
by the Spartans for the first time 
since the 2009-10 season.

It doesn’t help that Michigan 

State (8-4, 17-8) is playing its best 
stretch of basketball all season.

“It seems like every time 

we’re about to play Michigan 
State, they’re playing their best 
basketball,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “They had a great 
week, going to Northwestern, 
winning easily, and then beating 
a really great Ohio State team. 
So they’re playing well. They 
seem to have a really good flow 
right now. I think they’re pretty 
healthy.”

Currently 
leading 
the 

Spartans 
is 
guard 
Denzel 

Valentine, who clinched their 

win over Ohio State on Saturday 
with 
a 
last-

second triple. 
Averaging 
14.5 
points 

per game to 
go along with 
six rebounds, 
Valentine 
currently 
stands at third 
in 
3-pointers 

made 
this 

season in the 
Big Ten and fifth in 3-point 
percentage. Measuring 6-foot-
5 and 220 pounds, the versatile 

athlete has the perfect mixture 

of 
size 
and 

skills.

“He’s 
got 

the 
rare 

combination 
of 
that 
he 

can 
really 

rebound,” 
Beilein 
said. 

“His 
3-point 

shot right now 
is at high as a 
level as it is in 

the league. And he really can see 
the floor.”

In 
addition 
to 
Valentine, 

a player Beilein compared to 
former Wolverine guard Nik 
Stauskas and current junior 
guard 
Caris 
LeVert 
given 

his height and court vision, 
Michigan will have to deal 
with 
a 
Spartan 
team 
that 

outrebounded it by 14 the last 
time the teams met due to their 
superior size and length.

“You’d like to make up for the 

rebounding by just having better 
possessions offensively and not 
turning the ball over,” Beilein 
said. “(But) we don’t have a lot 
of ways to negate rebounding, 
so we’ve got to get a body on 

somebody, do a fundamental 
block-out and hope the ball 
bounces our way. It’s not a jump 
ball as much as it’s a possession 
rebound.”

As much as it seems Michigan 

will have its back against the 
wall against Michigan State, 
that doesn’t mean the quality of 
the game will be diminished.

If the in-state rivals have 

proved 
anything 
in 
recent 

years, the game will be a battle 
regardless 
of 
the 
adversity 

either team faces.

“I don’t expect it to be 

anything different right here,” 
Beilein said. “Both programs 
have gotten to the point where 
they’re really good. People expect 
a great game. But even when I 
first got here, going up there or 
coming here, even though our 
teams were in that building stage 
of our program, I always thought 
these games were the same. … 
It’s a great game. I don’t think it’s 
lost anything.”

Added 
Albrecht: 
“The 

intensity is still there. It’s still a 
heated rivalry.”

Though the contest doesn’t 

have the same implications of 
last year’s affair in Ann Arbor 
— a battle of two top-20 teams 
fighting for sole possession of 
first place in the Big Ten — the 
atmosphere could still mimic 
last year’s high-intensity clash 
of “two gladiators slugging it 
out,” as Beilein put it.

NOTES: According to their 

Twitter 
accounts, 
former 

Wolverines Nik Stauskas and 
Glenn Robinson III will be in 
attendance for Tuesday night’s 
game against the Spartans. The 
duo combined for 40 points 
in Michigan 79-70 win in Ann 
Arbor last year. … Michigan 
freshman Austin Hatch was 
selected to receive the U.S. 
Basketball Writers Association’s 
Most Courageous Award for 
2015. Hatch will accept the 
award during the week of the 
Final Four in Indianapolis.
