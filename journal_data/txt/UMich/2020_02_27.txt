Earlier 
this 
month, 
the 
Martha Cook Residence Hall’s 
Board of Governors sent out a 
revised 2020-2021 dining hall 
schedule to residents. The 
new dining plan will include a 
17-meal plan Sunday through 
Friday, with no dining hall 
access on Saturdays. It will also 
continue to provide Deluxe Tea 
on Friday, and special dining 
events throughout the year. 
Currently, the Martha Cook 
dining hall is open from 7:00 
a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on weekdays 
and has limited hours on 
weekends, while other dining 
halls on campus are open 
from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. on 
weekdays and on weekends 
from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. for 
brunch and 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 
p.m. for dinner. 
With 
the 
current 
plan, 
Martha Cook residents aren’t 
able to swipe into other dining 
halls, 
except 
on 
Saturday 
nights 
when 
the 
Martha 
Cook dining hall isn’t serving 
dinner. With the new plan, 
residents wouldn’t be able to 
swipe into other dining halls 
at all. 

More than 100 students had 
the opportunity to listen to 
current public policy thoughts 
from 
Denis 
McDonough, 
former White House Chief 
of Staff for President Barack 
Obama, during the event “New 
Frontiers: Labor, Immigration 
and Foreign Policy.” 
In 
the 
conversational 
event, McDonough and John 

Ciorciari, 
director 
of 
the 
Weiser Diplomacy Center and 
International Policy Center 
and associate professor of 
Ford School of Public Policy, 
discussed the state of labor 
markets 
in 
association 
with the U.S. economy and 
international affairs, as well as 
reflections on McDonough’s 
time at the White House. 
When asked what changes 
he believed would be needed 
to promote a more fair labor 

market 
and 
include 
the 
strengths 
of 
individuals, 
McDonough responded with 
his hopes for the future of the 
market.
“I’d 
like 
to 
see 
higher 
education 
become 
more 
affordable,” McDonough said. 
“Also, I’d like just to figure 
out a way for us to have a 
more nimble training and 
education opportunity over 
the course of an individual’s 
lifetime … So the question is 

how do we make the rest of the 
training infrastructure more 
accessible, flexible and agile 
to respond to people’s lives, 
rather than making people 
drop their lives to try to get 
into the system.” 
Public 
Policy 
graduate 
student 
Kellen 
Datta 
was 
in attendance to learn more 
about McDonough’s role in 
the Obama administration and 
hear his thoughts on the labor 
market.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Marcia 
Rieke, 
regents’ 
professor of astronomy at the 
University of Arizona, spoke 
about the James Webb Space 
Telescope (JWST), the upcoming 
successor to the Hubble Space 
Telescope, in a talk in the 
Michigan League on Wednesday. 
The lecture was part of Rieke’s 
reception of the department 
of astronomy’s Mohler Prize, 
which is awarded for excellence 

in research on astronomy and 
astrophysics, and named after 
Orren 
Mohler, 
former 
head 
of 
University 
of 
Michigan 
observatories. Approximately 70 
people were in attendance.
Rieke 
began 
by 
talking 
about the current Hubble and 
explaining why a new space 
telescope was being developed. 
According to Rieke, the Hubble is 
not big or powerful enough to see 
the most distant galaxies. This 
is because it can only see a small 
part of the infrared spectrum. 
Rieke explained infrared light 

is important for seeing distant 
objects because of a phenomenon 
called “redshift.”
“The more distant an object, 
the more its light output is shifted 
to red wavelengths and it gets to 
the point where you can’t just rely 
on visible light, you have to go to 
longer wavelengths to the part 
of the spectrum beyond the red, 
called infrared,” Rieke said.
Because of redshift and the 
discovery that the rate at which 
a galaxy moves away from earth 
is proportional to how far away 
it is from the earth, scientists 

can figure out the age of galaxies 
from light.
“So if we measure a spectrum 
… we know the velocity and 
therefore we know how far away 
the galaxy is and we know what 
its age was when the light was 
made,” Rieke said.
While the Hubble in its current 
form can see objects formed 
up to 13.4 billion years ago, the 
new JWST, with its advanced 
infrared capabilities, will allow 
scientists to see even further 
into the past, giving them greater

Ron Weiser gives 
$10 million to fund 
construction of new 
real estate center

University 
of 
Michigan 
administrators 
recently 
announced the Ross School 
of Business would launch a 
comprehensive 
real 
estate 
center 
during 
last 
week’s 
University Board of Regents 
meeting. The news came after 
the University received a $10 
million gift from Regent Ron 
Weiser (R).
LSA senior Kate Walker 
has taken three upper-level 
real estate courses offered 
to undergraduates. She said 
students like her will soon be 
able to take even more courses 
in real estate with the new 
center.
“My first initial reaction 
was that I wouldn’t be here for 
that (because I’m graduating 
this semester),” Walker said. 
“I think it’s going to be a great 
opportunity for those students 
coming in. ... I mean real estate 
is all around us. It’s not like life 
or death and being a doctor but 
it’s something that’s always 
going to be needed.”

In an email to The Daily, 
Engineering 
senior 
Daniel 
Banooni wrote that many Ross 
alumni have gone into real 
estate, including Stephen Ross, 
a billionaire businessman who 
recently announced plans to 
donate $100 million towards 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
University’s Detroit Center for 
Innovation.
Banooni said he’s excited 
the program is being created, 
but it has been long overdue.
“I think that Ross has 
been in need of a Real Estate 
program for a very long time,” 
Banooni wrote. “Stephen Ross 
himself is a guru of real estate, 
and the school for me almost 
represents 
success 
in 
the 
field. I am very jealous of the 
students that will have access 
to the resources that the new 
center will provide.”
According to the Business 
School’s 
website, 
the 
new 
Weiser Center for Real Estate 
will offer “a suite of practice-
oriented courses focused at 
the intersection of business 
and real estate.”

Change 
At 
Michigan, 
a 
Central Student Government 
campaign 
focused 
on 
increasing the organization’s 
connection 
to 
students, 
announced its candidacy for 
the March election Wednesday 
night.
In an interview with The 
Daily, Rackham student Austin 
Glass, presidential candidate 
of Change At Michigan, said 
CSG has done work to better 
the experiences of students on 
campus. However, he said the 
organization should do more 
in the realm of advocating 
the 
needs 
of 
students 
to 
the University of Michigan 
administration.
“In our best moments as an 
organization, we do really great 
things on behalf of students: 
we advocate for changes to 
policies that the University is 
promulgating that do not have 
the students’ best interests in 
mind and, in particular, not the 
best interests of students who 
don’t traditionally have a voice 
in administrative structures,” 
Glass said.

“We need to be doing a whole 
heck of a lot more of that, and I 
think that we have the capacity 
to do a lot more of that.”
Glass previously served as the 
CSG Speaker of the Assembly. 
He is currently a Rackham 
representative and chair of the 

Rules Committee. 
Change 
At 
Michigan’s 
platform will center around 
combating sexual misconduct 
on campus and achieving carbon 
neutrality; increasing diversity, 
equity and inclusion; wellness; 
and student engagement. 
In 
the 
same 
vein, 
LSA 
sophomore Megha Jain, vice-
presidential 
candidate 
of 
Change at Michigan, said one of 

the party’s goals over the course 
of the campaign is to engage 
as many students as possible, 
which will hopefully improve 
voter turnout. Voter turnout 
in the March CSG election 
has 
historically 
hovered 
at 
approximately 19 percent of the 
student body.
Jain said she is hopeful 
students 
will 
share 
their 
opinions with the party so they 

feel like they have a voice and 
are compelled to vote.
“People are not going to vote 
for a government they don’t feel 
like is representing them, they 
don’t feel like is doing anything 
for them, so I will feel like 
our campaign did something 
successfully 
if 
that 
voter 
turnout rate goes up,” Jain said. 

The Ann Arbor campaign 
office 
of 
Democratic 
presidential 
candidate 
Michael 
Bloomberg 
was 
vandalized 
on 
Feb 
13. 
The office said the words 
“corporate pig” were spray-
painted on the window. The 
event was reported to the 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
shortly afterward. 
This is not an isolated 
incident, as various Bloomberg 
campaign offices across the 
country have been vandalized 
in the past several weeks, 
including 
some 
in 
Ohio, 
Utah, Tennessee and Illinois. 
On Feb. 16, the campaign 
reported that a sign reading 
“Eat the Rich” was put outside 
their office in Flint. 
Campaign 
manager 
Kevin Sheekey responded to 
vandalism at a Bloomberg 
office in Knoxville, Tenn., 
on Feb. 20 and other related 
incidents, 
including 
those 
in Michigan, in a statement 

issued on Feb. 21. 
“Over the past week, we’ve 
seen similar attacks against 
Mike Bloomberg 2020 offices 
in multiple states,” Sheekey 
said. “Fortunately, no one has 
been injured. But this needs 
to end before someone gets 
hurt.” 
The 
Bloomberg 
Chicago 
office 
had 
the 
words 
“racist,” “sexist,” “GOP” and 
“oligarch” 
spray-painted 
across the front window on 
Sunday night. Sheekey issued 
another statement on Monday 
in response. 
“Yet again, one of our 
campaign offices has been 
vandalized with derogatory 
language — using the word 
‘oligarch’ — in an act of hate,” 
Sheekey said. “We cannot, 
and will not, tolerate these 
acts. While we do not know 
who is directly responsible, 
we do know Senator Bernie 
Sanders and his campaign 
have 
repeatedly 
invoked 
this language, and the word 
‘oligarch’ specifically when 
discussing Mike Bloomberg 
and his campaign.” 
Freeland Ellis, the Midwest 
regional 
press 
secretary 

for the Sanders campaign, 
declined to comment on the 
vandalism in an email to The 
Daily.
“No comment at this time 
but I’ll keep you posted,” Ellis 
wrote.
Bloomberg 
has 
visited 
Michigan twice since he began 
his 
presidential 
campaign 
in November, holding a rally 
on Feb. 4 in Detroit. Having 
already 
opened 
offices 
in 
Flint, Ann Arbor, Warren and 
Bloomfield Hills, Bloomberg 
has made it clear that he 
intends to focus heavily on 
Michigan given its status as a 
swing state. 
This 
is 
not 
the 
first 
time Bloomberg has faced 
backlash 
in 
Ann 
Arbor. 
When the former New York 
City 
mayor 
delivered 
the 
University of Michigan Spring 
Commencement address in 
2016, the crowd booed his 
criticism of safe spaces and 
microaggressions.
“The 
fact 
that 
some 
university 
boards 
and 
administrations now bow to 
pressure and shield students 
from 
these 
ideas 
through 
‘safe spaces,’ ‘code words’ 

and ‘trigger warnings’ is, in 
my view, a terrible mistake,” 
Bloomberg said in 2016. “The 
whole purpose of college is 
to learn how to deal with 
difficult 
situations 
— 
not 
run 
away 
from 
them. 
A 
microaggression 
is 
exactly 
that: micro.”
Bloomberg 
took 
shots 
at Sanders in 2016 as well. 
During his speech in the 
Big House, Bloomberg told 
graduating 
students 
they 
shouldn’t trust people who 
promise to give them things 
for free.
“When a populist candidate 
promises free college, free 
health care and a pony, or 
another candidate promises 
to make other countries pay 
for 
our 
needs, 
remember: 
those who promise you a free 
lunch will invariably eat you 
for 
breakfast,” 
Bloomberg 
said. “If there were simple 
solutions 
to 
complex 
problems, we wouldn’t have 
those problems.”

Kertina 
Kimbrough, 
former senior administrative 
assistant at the University of 
Michigan, filed a lawsuit Feb. 
19 
alleging 
the 
University 
denied her a second interview 
for a position as research 
office administrator in the 
Department of Psychiatry due 
to racial discrimination. 
According to the lawsuit, 
the 
University 
posted 
the 
position in September 2018 and 
Kimbrough applied for the job 
that month. 
The 
research 
office 
administrator 
position 
required two to four years 
of 
experience 
performing 
general administrative work. 

Kimbrough had worked for 
the University since 2015 and 
held a position as a senior 
administrative assistant. 
Four 
people 
interviewed 
for the position –– one other 
Black 
candidate 
and 
two 
white 
candidates. 
Of 
the 
interviewees, 
Kimbrough 
alleges 
she 
had 
the 
most 
education and administrative 
experience. 
The position also required 
at least a bachelor’s degree, 
and 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
interview, 
Kimbrough 
held 
both bachelor’s and master’s 
degrees. The candidate hired 
for the position, who is white, 
does not hold a college degree.
Kimbrough 
alleges 
her 
greater 
educational 
and 
administrative 
experience 

made her more qualified for 
the position than the four 
other candidates yet she was 
denied a second interview 
based on race. 
Kayce 
Newcomb, 
administrator 
of 
the 
Department of Psychiatry and 
the named defendant in the 
case, awarded the position to 
the other candidate because 
she was a “better fit,” according 
to MLive. 
University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald said the University 
had 
no 
further 
comment 
regarding the pending lawsuit. 
This is not the first time 
the 
University 
has 
faced 
a 
discrimination 
lawsuit. 
Professor 
Emily 
Lawsin 
and former Professor Scott 
Kurashige filed a lawsuit in 

2016 against the University 
under the Elliott-Larsen Civil 
Rights Act, which included 
claims 
such 
as 
disparate 
treatment, 
discriminatory 
hiring 
practices 
and 
sex 
discrimination. In December 
2019, a jury sided in favor of 
the University, saying it did not 
discriminate against Lawsin 
and Kurashige.
Earlier this month, U-M Flint 
employee 
Heather 
Johnson 
filed a separate lawsuit against 
U-M 
Flint, 
claiming 
the 
university fired her after she 
advocated for better resources 
for the LGBTQ+ community on 
campus. 
Reporter Julia Rubin can be 
reached at julrubin@umich.edu.

“I think that the market 
itself 
is 
insufficiently 
transparent,” Datta said. “It 
leaves out a lot of people who 
may have the skills but are 
not able to advertise those 
skills because we advertise 
the job on credentials that 
two-thirds of the country 
does not have.” 
Datta said the discussion 
piqued her interest in the 
policies 
of 
the 
Obama 
presidency. 
“For the first part of the 
Obama 
administration, 
I 
was really young, so I didn’t 
know a lot about it,” Datta 
said. “Now, looking at it 
retrospectively, I feel like I 
have a lot more to learn.” 
When asked what she was 
excited about most with the 
event, Julia Schwarz, events 
and outreach manager at the 
Public Policy School, said 
she 
was 
looking 
forward 
to listening to the political 
criticisms 
proposed 
by 
McDonough. 
“I think just the breadth 
of the conversation. He’s not 
someone that’s just done one 
thing. He’s done many, many 
things and I think they’re 
going to cover a really wide 
range of topics which will be 
very interesting,” Schwarz 
said.
Since the end of his term 
in 
2017, 
McDonough 
has 
been involved at the Markle 
Foundation, 
where 
he 
is 
a 
senior 
adviser 
working 
to 
create 
a 
skills-based 
market that will allow all 
Americans to succeed in the 
digital economy. He is also 
an Executive Fellow at the 
University of Notre Dame’s 
Keough 
School 
of 
Global 
Affairs. 
Retired 
diplomat 
John 
Fogarasi 
and 
Richard 
Corson, 
former 
director 
of the East Michigan U.S. 
Export 
Assistance 
Center 

with 
the 
U.S. 
Commerce 
Department, were also in 
attendance. Fogarasi said he 
wanted to hear McDonough’s 
perspective as someone who 
worked closely with Obama 
as Chief of Staff to the 
President.
“Both Richard and I have 
worked in careers in the 
U.S. government. Listening 
to an individual who has 
had a significant role in 
government is particularly 
interesting, but we’re both 
interested in international 
affairs,” Fogarasi said. 
When asked if they were 
looking for anything specific 
to hear, Fogarasi was eager to 
answer, given his past in the 
public sector. 
“He’s got such experience. 
And 
of 
course, 
there’s 
controversy 
today 
about 
how 
the 
White 
House 
operates,” 
Fogarasi 
said. 
“So it’s interesting to get 
his viewpoints on that and 
perhaps 
any 
suggestions 
and insights he has on going 
forward.” 
To 
conclude 
the 
event, 
McDonough gave some advice 
to students aspiring to work 
in public service. 
“President Obama sought 
me out particularly because 
of my view and oftentimes 
because he knew it was 
different than his,” he said. 
“So my expectation isn’t that 
I’ll win every argument. Who 
gets to work at a job where you 
get to win every argument? 
And if you do, you’re probably 
working in the wrong place.” 
McDonough 
urged 
students to be outspoken and 
ambitious. 
“My advice is to speak your 
mind,” McDonough said. “Be 
as smart as you can be. Be 
as passionate as you can be. 
Don’t put your light under the 
bushel. Put your light on top 
of the bushel.”

Students 
will 
have 
the opportunity to work 
directly 
with 
real 
estate 
firms through action-based 
learning programs like the 
Multidisciplinary 
Action 
Projects.
The initiative will help 
develop 
the 
current 
real 
estate certificate program 
for graduate students and 
add a new undergraduate 
minor in real estate. In 
addition 
to 
courses 
and 
projects, 
the 
center 
will 
fund the Weiser Scholars 
Fellowship, through which 
six students will be offered 
access to student support 

and 
fellowship 
activities. 
Additional 
scholarships 
and paid internships will 
also be available.
Peter Allen, lecturer at the 
Business School and adjunct 
lecturer at Taubman College 
of Architecture and Urban 
Planning, said the new real 
estate center is an important 
step to emphasize the field 
and 
attract 
prospective 
students. 
“I was very elated because 
this is something that I felt 
was really important and 
something that I’ve been 
working on for some ways for 
over 20 years,” Allen said. “It 
took (Dean) Scott DeRue and 
his relationship with Ron 
Weiser to make it happen. 
I give them all the credit 

for pulling off something 
so valuable for the students 
and especially for the future 
to beef up the real estate 
agenda at the University of 
Michigan.”
Business 
School 
spokeswoman Bridget Vis 
wrote in an email to The 
Daily that the center will be 
housed in the Business School 
building 
in 
collaboration 
with other schools across 
campus, including Taubman 
College and the Ford School 
of Public Policy. Vis wrote 
a start date hasn’t been set 
because it will take time to 
hire new faculty and develop 
programs. More details will 
be announced in the coming 
months. 
Though 
the 
program 

is 
still 
being 
developed, 
Allen said he believes some 
equivalent graduate courses 
may become available to 
undergraduates 
through 
the center. Allen teaches 
a real estate development 
course in which students 
develop 
project 
proposals 
that 
emphasize 
new 
transportation 
and 
green 
construction. 
He 
said 
incorporating 
climate 
change-based 
ideas 
into 
the 
program 
would 
be 
important.
“The 
rebuilding 
of 
our 
growing 
cities 
and 
neighborhoods to deal with 
climate change, new means 
of mobility, new construction 
methods 
and 
sustainable, 
timeless 
architecture 
are 

critical,” Allen said.
Walker is in Allen’s real 
estate 
development 
class 
this semester and works at a 
commercial real estate firm. 
Walker said she was able to 
enroll in a graduate-level 
course this semester after 
she realized there weren’t 
any other undergraduate-
level courses in real estate. 
She said the center will make 
it easier for undergraduates 
to explore their passions in 
real estate.
“Overall, I think it’s going 
to be a great opportunity,” 
Walker said. “I think it’s 
something that we needed 
for a while. You don’t realize 
how important real estate is 
until you get in it.”
Banooni is also in Allen’s 

course. 
He 
wrote 
the 
program could open more 
opportunities 
to 
students 
so they don’t have to rely 
entirely on internships and 
personal experiences.
“There is zero doubt in 
my mind that more students 
will be getting involved in 
the real estate sector here at 
Michigan,” Banooni wrote. 
“If the administration of the 
center plays (its) cards right 
and markets the program 
to students all over the 
University, it could become 
one of the most coveted 
programs at Michigan.”

Community 

Scholars Program and Grace-
edu. In marketing for Change 
At Michigan, the party has 
branded itself as a group of 
CSG “outsiders and insiders” 
committed to reorienting the 
organization’s role.
Both Glass and Jain noted 
their 
experience 
working 
with the University on policy. 
Glass serves on the President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality, which is creating 
a list of recommendations for 
the 
University 
concerning 
climate 
change, 
and 
Jain 
noted her work on sexual 
misconduct policies.
Jain said she hopes CSG 
can elevate student voices 
to 
ensure 
the 
University 
is 
working 
in 
their 
best 

interest. 
She 
highlighted 
the importance of this for 
communities whose voices 
are normally overlooked.
“In this last year, I’ve seen 
that I’m not happy with a lot of 
the things that the University 
is doing, and I’ve looked for 
a lot of opportunities to be 
involved in changing that,” 
Jain said. “There are so many 
things that students have the 
power to be doing and to be 
changing, but it’s really just 
how do we actually make 
that connection between the 
administration and between 
Central Student Government, 
and how does CSG represent 
the entire campus? How does 
it in actuality and in policy 
represent groups that don’t 

really get the representation 
that 
they 
need 
at 
the 
University?”
Glass said he is optimistic 
that 
Change 
at 
Michigan 
will bring in students who 
understand 
the 
potential 
impact CSG can have and 
are prepared to leverage that 
power in favor of students. 
He also noted the importance 
of having students with this 
mindset 
in 
the 
executive 
branch.
“There are a lot of students 
who have come through CSG 
in the last two years who don’t 
take students seriously, who 
don’t take our role on campus 
seriously 
and 
don’t 
take 
the privilege that we have 
of being able to meet with 

administrators and speak on 
behalf of students seriously,” 
Glass said. “We aim to change 
that.”
With the announcement, 
Change At Michigan joins 
Mobilize, which announced 
its candidacy last week, in 
the race for control of CSG. 
Parties vying for CSG seats 
will campaign on campus 
and participate in a debate 
leading up to the election on 
March 25-26.
LSA 
sophomore 
Sujin 
Kim, party chair of Change 
At 
Michigan 
and 
current 
representative of CSG, said 
the 
strength 
of 
Change’s 
members is what sets them 
apart from other parties in 
the race.

“We have deep experience, 
we have people from within 
the Assembly who are quality 
people 
who 
know 
what 
they’re doing, who have a 
record of advocating to the 
administration in a way that 
is appropriate, and we also 
have a lot of people from 
different organizations, even 
from outside of CSG,” Kim 
said. “It speaks to our team, 
our policy and it speaks to 
what we are here to do that 
we are surrounded by such 
quality people. And I think 
that really is something that 
people should think about.”

The new plan would offer 
a 25-meal supplemental plan 
for $338.50, so each meal in 
the supplemental plan would 
average out to about $13.50 per 
swipe. This plan has prompted 
a negative response from some 
residents currently living in 
the building. One of them, LSA 
sophomore Salisha Baranwal, 
said she thinks this change 
further restricts an already-
constrained dining hall plan.
“Usually the dining hall is 
open to suggestions but next 
year, they are cutting back their 
already super short hours to 
absolutely nothing on Saturdays 

— the dining hall won’t even 
be open at all,” Baranwal said. 
“Already so many people are 
complaining about hours being 
super short.”
In an email to The Daily, 
Deborah Jansen, a member 
of the Martha Cook Board 
of Governors, referenced the 
budget in discussing the cut in 
hours.
“We are not providing meal 
service on Saturdays as the 
budget from Dining to provide 
that service exceeds the amount 
received in room and board 
fees,” Jansen wrote.
 
According to Martha Cook 
residents, flyers sent out said 
changing the dining hall plan 
will adjust rates for rooms 

in Martha Cook. The single 
rooms will all be moved to the 
deluxe single room rate, and the 
rates for double rooms will be 
reduced. 
LSA 
freshman 
Emilia 
O’Brien, another Martha Cook 
resident, commented on the 
financial burden of living in 
Martha Cook and potentially 
having to buy food from other 
places every Saturday.
“I think the goal, in general, is 
to not have anyone turned away 
from Martha Cook because they 
cannot afford to buy food on 
Saturdays or they cannot afford 
the increase in the price of living 
here versus another dorm,” 
O’Brien said. “I think that is just 
another challenge for residents 
who want to live here but don’t 

have the financial means.”
The residents The Daily spoke 
to have suggested alternatives 
such as swipes into other dining 
halls included in the basic plan, 
meals on Saturday game days 
and basic unprepared food such 
as cereal or salad being available 
for students on Saturdays. 
According to Baranwal, the 
Martha Cook dining hall is 
already limited, and this new 
dining hall plan could be an 
issue for more than just lower-
income students. 
“I know one of my friends has 
to UberEat or Grubhub her meal 
every Saturday because her foot 
is broken and she can’t walk 
anywhere,” Baranwal said.

ability to figure out when the first 
stars were formed.
Besides aiding scientists in 
figuring out when the first stars 
were 
formed, 
the 
increased 
infrared abilities of the JWST will 
also help scientists analyze the 
atmospheres of exoplanets, which 
are planets orbiting other stars, to 
see if they contain water and other 
important chemicals and could 
support life.
Rieke 
then 
described 
the 
technical specifications of the 
telescope. It is designed for 
a five-year timeline but will 
carry enough supplies to last 
up to 14 years. Additionally, the 

telescope will be cooled to the 
“low” temperature of 388 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Cooling the telescope 
this low is necessary to prevent 
the radiation from the telescope’s 
own heat from damaging the 
images it produces.
Besides cooling the equipment, 
another engineering challenge 
in 
producing 
the 
telescope 
was fitting it into a rocket. The 
telescope could not fit into a rocket 
the way it was meant to operate so 
it will be folded up and then get 
into position, Rieke explained.
“You can see the cutaway of a 
nose cone of a rocket,” Rieke said 
“You can kind of see that there’s 
a telescope…(it) doesn’t fit in very 
well. Well, how do you solve this 
problem? You turn your telescope 
into a piece of origami and you 

fold it up so it will fit inside the 
nose cone and that is part of what 
makes this mission challenging.”
Another difference between 
the Hubble and the JWST is the 
JWST will not be repairable 
like the Hubble was since it will 
be orbiting the sun about one 
million miles from the earth. 
Rieke said this isn’t a problem 
but just requires the team to 
conduct many tests to ensure the 
equipment functions properly.
“It’s not really a big problem if 
you take the appropriate steps,” 
Rieke said. “Appropriate steps 
mean you need to design for a long 
lifetime and test it thoroughly. 
I have spent a lot of my recent 
lifetime testing part of this, 
testing some of that — (it) was 
exciting and fun, some of it was 

scary, some of it was boring.”
After tests in three different 
locations, the JWST will be 
launched into orbit from a rocket 
in French Guinea. Rieke asserted 
the rocket is one of the most 
reliable large rockets around and 
underscored that it will be the 
right kind for a mission of this 
gravity. 
“Nearly $9 billion worth of 
stuff will be going on a reliable 
controlled explosion,” Rieke said. 
“It’ll all work.”
Though the tests occurred 
here on Earth, they involved 
extensive processes and were not 
without their own complications. 
A portion of testing in Houston 
happened 
during 
Hurricane 
Harvey, and though the telescope 
was safely secured, the hurricane 

almost caused the team to run 
out the liquid nitrogen they were 
using to cool the telescope. 
If all goes to schedule, the 
JWST is set to be launched into 
orbit by the end of this year. 
Rackham student Matt Patrick, 
who studies gamma-ray detection, 
regularly attends talks from the 
Department of Astronomy. He 
said another thrill of the JWST 
coming into operation is the 
bold investment in science and 
research that it represents.
“The engineering is really 
exciting (and so is) the willingness 
of the government and the science 
institutions to place a bet on these 
huge technologies — some of them 
not really proven yet,” Patrick 
said.
LSA student Rhiannon Singer, 

who majors in astronomy and 
extensively discussed the JWST 
in her astrophysics class, was 
excited to come to the event to 
hear about the new capabilities of 
this telescope.

“I think that the biggest thing is 
… that we will be able to look back 
farther in time so we will be able 
to get more detailed information 
about the earliest galaxies, the 
earliest formed structures of 
our universe,” Singer said. “We 
may be able to see some of these 
early structures we’ve never seen 
before and that will give us a lot 
of information about how the 
universe actually came to be the 
way it is.”

O

ne 
of 
my 
biggest 
transitions from high 
school 
to 
my 
first 
college experience at Boston 
University was the change 
from 
a 
small, 
conservative 
Midwestern town to a large, 
liberal East Coast city. No 
longer limited by small-town 
resources or conventions, I felt 
free to embrace progressive 
ideas and discover ways to 
express them. As a high school 
theater kid, my expression often 
came through performances 
that 
were 
unfortunately 
limited 
to 
ensemble 
roles 
in 
family-friendly 
musicals. 
But in college, I had the 
opportunity to tell stories far 
outside the conventional realm 
— for example, my chance 
to share the importance of 
perseverance against all odds 
while playing a talking chicken 
from Brooklyn. But throughout 
my time onstage, I never took 
on what I then considered to 
be the pièce de résistance of 
unconventional theater — The 
Vagina Monologues.
Written 
in 
1996 
by 
feminist 
Eve 
Ensler, 
The 
Vagina 
Monologues 
(TVM) 
is an episodic play based on 
interviews with hundreds of 
women about — you guessed it 
— vaginas. The play has since 
become a household name, and 
performing it is an unofficial 
right-of-passage for many college 
feminists. Fittingly, there are 
many opportunities to complete 
this ritual. The play is performed 
by 
organizations 
around 
the world during the annual 
V-Season, which is sponsored 
by a global non-profit called 
V-Day — founded by Ensler to 
end violence against women and 
girls. The University of Michigan 
group 
Students 
for 
Choice 
performed TVM annually up 
until 2018. U-M Dearborn staged 
a performance in 2019 and both 
Michigan State University and 
Ohio State University’s College 
of Medicine are participating 
in the current V-Season. Our 
neighbors in Ypsilanti, however, 
will not be taking part anytime 
soon.
The Women’s Resource Center 
at Eastern Michigan University 
announced in 2018 it will no 
longer host productions of TVM, 
citing the exclusive nature of the 
play’s version of feminism: “Not 
all women have vaginas.” Mount 
Holyoke, an all-women’s college 
in Massachusetts, made a similar 
decision in 2015. After seeing the 
play for the first time in 2019 — 
at Boston University, my former 
institution — I was equally 
disappointed by the exclusive 
nature of the play, along with 
a litany of other issues. EMU 

and Mount Holyoke have set 
examples 
other 
college 
and 
community organizations should 
consider following. While TVM 
was a monumental step forward 
in its time, its content is now 
outdated, no longer matching 
the messages or goals of modern 
feminism 
that 
embraces 
inclusion and intersectionality. 
In many ways, TVM is actually 
working against the modern 
progressive 
movement. 
We 
should focus on telling new 
stories that empower all women 
and reflect the ways class, race, 
national origin, gender identity, 
sexual 
orientation, 
disability 
and 
many 
other 
identities 
intersect with womanhood. (It’s 
important to note that Students 
for Choice later preformed a 
spin-off of TVM in the Rackham 
Auditorium called Patchwork, 
a version that improved the 
representation 
of 
TVM’s 
outdated and narrow definition 
of womanhood.)
The issues with the script 
are apparent. First, consider 
the 
title 
of 
the 
play. 
The 
centering of womanhood on 
vaginas 
is 
reductionist 
and 
minimizes women down to their 
reproductive 
organs. 
Vagina-
essentialism is a major issue as 
well — the centrality of vaginas is 
exclusionary to women without 
vaginas and inconsiderate of non-
women with vaginas. Within the 
monologues, there are problems 
as well. The play’s response to 
the sexual repression of the 
era tries to overcompensate 
by 
portraying 
women 
as 
perpetually 
hypersexualized. 
And for a play supposedly about 
vaginas, female desire within 
the script is often phallocentric. 
Moreover, with V-Day claiming 
to fight against sexual violence, 
it is absolutely hypocritical that 
the play continues to include a 
scene titled “The Little Coochi 
Snorcher That Could” which 
glorifies 
the 
grooming 
and 
rape of a 16-year-old girl by 
a 
24-year-old 
woman. 
This 
is 
even 
more 
reprehensible 
when considering one of the 
only mentions of a same-sex 
relationship between women in 
the entire play is predatory 
and non-consensual. Finally, 
while the play is lacking in 
representation of race and 
ethnicity, 
any 
scenes 
that 
do come from international 
perspectives often pander to 
racist American stereotypes. 
The play and the organization, 
V-Day, have been criticized for 
colonialism, and the script’s 
correlation 
of 
international 
perspectives 
with 
violence 
— 
compared 
to 
the 
U.S. 
perspective with pleasure — 
supports this criticism.

The play might be more of a 
fit for modern feminism if this 
content could be revised or cut 
entirely at the discretion of the 
performers. However, staging 
a performance of TVM means 
adhering to all of V-Day’s rules 
and guidelines — one of which 
is that no edits can be made 
to either the monologues or 
their introductions, “AT ALL.” 
This rule, along with the fact 
that the script has scarcely 
changed since 1996, reflects 
a stubbornness on the part of 
Ensler and the organization. 
While another guideline states 
the 
importance 
of 
striving 
for 
diversity, 
it’s 
impossible 
to praise this effort when the 
organization refuses to redress 
issues within the play itself. If 
V-Day were truly committed to 
diversity 
and 
representation, 
they would alter the script to 
reduce exclusivity, colonialism 
and vagina-essentialism. Better 
yet, they would sponsor the 
performance 
of 
new 
plays 
from new perspectives every 
year. They have already taken 
a step in the right direction by 
offering other event options — 
unfortunately, TVM continues to 
be the primary production.
Although 
Ensler 
acknowledges the play’s original 
message 
does 
not 
reflect 
modern feminism, she defends 
the continued performance of 
the play, claiming, “one play 
can’t be everything.” Ensler 
is 
right: 
It’s 
impossible 
to 
expect any one piece of media 
to encompass the whole of the 
human experience. But if one 
play can’t be everything, then 
one play shouldn’t be allowed 
to take up so much space. We 
need to make room for a greater 
variety of perspectives, ensuring 
no one perspective overpowers 
the others — especially not an 
exclusive one.
TVM is a relic of a former 
era. It debuted at a time when 
it was nearly impossible to 
talk about vaginas publicly, 
and for that, it deserves its due 
credit. But today, its prevalence 
occupies space that could be 
better served sharing stories 
of those who have long been 
underrepresented. We can still 
be inspired by TVM to create 
and 
perform 
artwork 
that 
flies in the face of convention 
and allows for genuine self-
expression. But V-Day should 
use its platform to give a voice to 
the voiceless, rather than telling 
the same outdated story again 
and again. It’s time to nix the 
monologues — womanhood is a 
story worth being told in stereo.

T

he rat race continues. The 
Democratic primaries are 
as chaotic as when they 
started, despite candidates like 
Andrew Yang and Deval Patrick 
dropping out and congealing the vote. 
Michael Bloomberg, despite missing 
the deadline for the first four states, 
has paid his way into double digit 
polls and is determined to unseat 
his longtime friend and golf partner, 
Donald Trump. Understandably, 
there’s a lot of buzz surrounding this 
election cycle. It’s almost excessive, 
with the divide between moderates 
and progressives of the Democratic 
Party and its rabid infighting causing 
even more coverage. But I think 
much of the media, especially those 
who lean left, are focusing too much 
on the wrong election.
Of 
course, 
the 
Democratic 
nominee is an important aspect of 
the 2020 race, but many people are 
forgetting the bigger picture amid 
the selection process. People seem 
to think that running against the 
orange man will be a cakewalk. 
After all, he’s an incredibly flawed 
candidate with plenty of skeletons 
in his closet. But don’t be too sure. 
Winning against Trump will not be 
easy, as much as you may want it to 
be.
The 
Republican 
primaries 
are looking to be an easy sweep 
for 
Trump, 
despite 
former 
Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld 
vying for the nomination as well. It’s 
not too common for an incumbent 
president to be challenged within 
their own party, but don’t let a small 
wing of dissidents persuade you that 
they’ll vote blue instead.
Trump’s 
turnout 
in 
New 
Hampshire was at an astounding 
129,696 
votes, 
nearly 
doubling 
Obama and Bush’s numbers as 
incumbents. Trump manages to stir 
up an energetic base that’s unrivaled 
by many candidates across the 
aisle. Joe Biden, who was thought 
to be the frontrunner for the first 
months of the primary race, pales 
in comparison when it comes to 
passionate voters. It’s utterly pathetic. 
Rising star Pete Buttigieg, who 
shocked the nation with his turnout 
in Iowa and New Hampshire, can’t 
meet the numbers the incumbent 
has. His 4,500 attendees in Utah 
doesn’t 
match 
Trump’s 
11,000 
attendees (not 50,000 like he 
claims) in New Hampshire. Amy 
Klobuchar’s 
campaign, 
despite 
its growing momentum, only has 
crowds that number about 1,000 
people. The only candidate to truly 

have the energy to rival Trump 
seems to be Bernie Sanders, with 
over 17,000 people showing up at 
his rally in Washington state. It’s not 
entirely fair to compare crowd sizes 
from states with vastly different 
demographics, but 11,000 in a state 
as small as New Hampshire should 
set off alarms for the Democrats. 
In the 2016 primary, Sanders drew 
larger crowds than former Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton, but she still 
won the nomination. Rallies can be 
misleading. But, one can still evaluate 
the enthusiasm and energy behind a 
candidate’s campaign, and many of 
the competitive Democrats simply 
can’t gather crowds.
The impression that the election 
will be easy is an intuition formed 
by unfavorable polls and nonstop 
criticisms of him and his policies. 
Trump 
has 
been 
consistently 
unpopular for most of his four 
years, but things are starting to 
shift. Against all odds, even through 
his impeachment in the House, 
the president’s approval is at the 
highest it’s been since his election. 
His approval is now in the margin 
of many other two-term presidents 
before their re-election. One of 
the “strengths” of his campaign 
is economic growth. Even if the 
economic voter is becoming less of 
a factor, I’d imagine many people 
still weigh their vote heavily on how 
they think the economy is doing. The 
stock market has been on a perpetual 
rise since 2013, hitting all-time highs 
consistently. Trump loves to take 
credit for a better economy, citing the 
stock market and job creation. The 
validity of his claims is, of course, 
questionable. A similar period of 30 
months under Obama’s presidency 
actually saw more jobs created than 
Trump, 6.5 million compared to 5.8 
million. The stock market is doing 
well, yes, but it’s almost delusional 
to believe that it has any real impact 
on working people. The stock market 
has seen a growth of 42 percent 
under Trump’s presidency, but 
wages have only increased by 
9 percent. But despite the facts, 
Trump has seen increased support 
due to his trickle-down policies. 
In a recent poll conducted by 
The Washington Post and ABC 
News, 56 percent of people looked 
favorably upon his economy. It’s a 
tall order convincing people to vote 
for limits on an economy they think 
is doing well, and Democrats need 
to find a way to combat his claims.
Trump 
is 
still 
viewed 
as 
unfavorable by women and people 

of color, just like in 2016. But it 
would be a foolish assumption to 
think their votes are guaranteed. 
Despite his egregious sexism, he 
managed to receive 52 percent of 
white women’s votes in 2016. Only 
white women, mind you, but that’s 
higher than one would expect. The 
same goes for Latinos, surprisingly. 
Black voters consistently dislike 
Trump, but Latino voters have 
been polling at 30 percent favorable 
for 
the 
incumbent 
president. 
It doesn’t sound like much — a 
majority still unwilling to vote for 
him — but the Democrats should 
be more concerned. It’s a bad 
habit for the Democrats to take 
the votes of women and people of 
color for granted. Despite their 
claims to represent the interests of 
marginalized groups, there is an 
element of racism that lets people 
believe the voting bloc is just a 
homogenous and guaranteed vote. 
But with the margins of victory 
for presidential elections in recent 
years getting smaller and smaller, 
every vote counts. Some of the 
frontrunners in the 2020 primaries 
are not doing well with people of 
color, specifically Buttigieg and 
Klobuchar. If the nomination goes 
to a candidate that can’t inspire 
non-whites to come out and vote, it 
could prove to be an Achilles heel 
for Democrats.
It worries me that so many 
people are taking this election 
for granted. It’s not hard to 
imagine Trump losing, but we 
said the same thing in 2016. 
Contemporary 
politics 
has 
proven to be the era of political 
upsets. Polls can be egregiously 
misleading and predictions can 
be horribly incorrect. Even within 
this election cycle, we’ve seen 
Biden slide from the frontrunner 
to a position in which his odds 
now seem insurmountable. This 
election needs to be taken 
seriously, and Trump needs 
to be taken seriously. Even 
though Trump may be playing 
tic-tac-toe rather than 4-D 
chess, even if he seems like an 
incompetent fool, even in the 
likelihood that his win was a 
fluke — a demagogue is still a 
demagogue. And if there’s one 
thing fearmongers do best, it’s 
persisting in the face of reality. 
Take at least this with you: 
Don’t get comfortable.

L

ast 
fall, 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
Planning Commission was 
met with enthusiasm from 
residents to establish 
more 
high-density 
zoning 
outside 
the 
downtown 
area. 
In 
essence, this ordinance 
would 
enable 
more 
infrastructure 
to 
be 
constructed 
both 
inside 
and 
outside 
the downtown area. 
In 
particular, 
the 
commission expressed 
its intention to increase 
density along Ann Arbor’s transit 
corridors. Community members 
have approved of this for the 
environmental benefits of public 
transportation. Others have also felt 
reluctant to proceed with the city’s 
desultory transit system, advocating 
for the improvement of Ann Arbor’s 
current 
transit 
system 
before 
building infrastructure tailored to it.
In the past several months, the 
Regional Transit Authority (RTA) 
of Southeast Michigan and other 
municipal organizations involved 
in Detroit have been pushing for 
the city of Ann Arbor to upgrade 
its transit. Ann Arbor has been 
asked to join them in pursuing a 
regional mobility testing corridor 
that runs along Michigan Avenue 
from Washtenaw County to Wayne 
County. However, the Ann Arbor 
City Council has avoided addressing 
the topic and removed it from the 
agenda for their January meeting. 
In an effort to gather feedback on the 
RTA’s ideas for transit development 
from Ann Arbor to Detroit, regional 
transit leaders even outlined the $10 
billion plan to Ann Arbor community 
members this past summer — a plan 
that the council appears to have 
ignored.
Given the council’s reluctance to 
consider the development of new 
mass public transit systems, it’s 
necessary to consider the benefits 
and consequences of introducing 
them. More importantly, we must 
reach a consensus about what to do. 
There are numerous advantages and 
disadvantages to pursuing transit 

development in these proposed 
ways. We need to recognize how 
advantageous 
pursuing 
these 
developments could be 
for the overall future of 
Ann Arbor.
In 
general, 
the 
integration of public 
transportation into a 
city’s infrastructure is 
beneficial to the city’s 
environmental quality. 
In improving air quality, 
reducing 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
and 
saving energy, the use 
of public transportation causes less 
damage to the environment than 
individual transportation methods. 
Simultaneously, 
constructing 
various types of public transportation 
promotes more compact urban 
development, decreasing the overall 
demand for individual travel and 
promoting 
green 
development. 
Considering that Ann Arbor has 
contributed more than 2.21 metric 
tons of carbon emissions since 2010, 
the city should consider reforming 
infrastructure around mobility and 
mass transit for the environmental 
compensation it owes.
By designing and constructing 
accessible transit corridors, the 
city government could promote the 
development of more affordable 
housing in Ann Arbor. In making 
transit corridors accessible to 
more portions of Washtenaw 
County, the city could encourage 
widespread 
usage 
of 
public 
transportation 
and 
ultimately 
connect 
a 
greater 
proportion 
of residential communities. At 
the same time, residential areas 
may see an increase in housing 
opportunities as the city expands 
high-density zoning in anticipation 
of attracting a large number 
of residents to our city and the 
Detroit Metropolitan Area. The 
act of constructing reliable and 
extensive 
transit 
corridors 
in 
Ann Arbor seems to mirror the 
massive 
cultural 
development 
of the modern community here. 
Thus, the city government could 
ultimately improve its population’s 

overall satisfaction by installing 
these developments in Ann Arbor 
and Metro Detroit.
Despite the advantages of transit 
developments and the subsequent 
infrastructural developments that 
could follow, it’s critical to question 
if this type of urban development 
is even capable of benefitting 
Ann Arbor and Metro Detroit as 
these regions stand today. Given 
the history of Detroit’s public 
transportation 
shortcomings, 
many seem reluctant to skip fixing 
the public transportation system 
before beginning to implement 
it throughout the region. Others 
feel 
that 
developing 
public 
transportation in Ann Arbor and 
Metro Detroit is not the solution 
that our communities need to 
make these cities better. Instead, 
people are prioritizing their focus 
on more pressing issues, such 
as education and public safety. 
In the same way, some lament 
that the scope of public transit 
developments is counterintuitive 
to the preservation of Ann Arbor’s 
integrity, a small city whose 
connection to homegrown culture 
and local history could take 
priority over developments for the 
future.
Even 
considering 
some 
of 
these drawbacks, it’s important to 
understand that times are changing 
and the way the Ann Arbor 
community could put our city in 
a position to withstand the test of 
time is to invest in its future, which 
comes with plans on how to improve 
and develop its infrastructure. It’s 
important to reminisce on the past 
to understand how we got to where 
we are today, but it’s altogether 
more realistic that we facilitate Ann 
Arbor’s transition toward being a 
city of the future. Thus, with the 
proper considerations and projected 
outcomes, we should be working to 
establish and normalize these modes 
of mass transportation that have 
been an object of advancement by 
city and regional leaders for years.

Defense helping inconsistent offense

It had been nearly eight 
minutes since Michigan’s last 
field goal. 
Early in the fourth quarter 
against Michigan State on Sunday, 
the Wolverines’ offense looked 
completely dysfunctional. They 
made just one field goal the entire 
second half up to that point, and 
turned the ball over 10 times in 
the third quarter alone. They 
drew fouls, but only made one free 
throw each trip to the line. 
Then, with 6:54 remaining in 
the fourth quarter, sophomore 
forward Naz Hillmon drove to 
the hoop, hit a layup, drew a foul 
and hit the resulting free throw to 
finally end the drought. The three-
point play was necessary to get the 
offense going again in Michigan’s 
65-57 win over the Spartans. 
But even more important was 
what happened on the other side 
of the floor during those eight 
minutes. 
A minor scoring drought can 
quickly turn into a disaster or cost 
a team the game if the defense 
can’t get stops. And although 
Michigan State did score 13 
points during that drought, the 
Wolverines’ defense made enough 
key plays to still emerge ahead at 
the end of it.
To be clear, Michigan isn’t a 
bad offensive team. Its 71 points 
per game put it at sixth in the Big 
Ten — not great, but adequate 
enough to win games. It just has 
a tendency to go through long 
scoring droughts like against 
Michigan State, and that’s where 
its strong defense becomes even 
more crucial.
“(We focused on) going on 
defense and just really trying to 
get those stops,” Hillmon said. 
“Really just taking pride in our 
defense, making sure we had 
our rotations, and just taking 
away what they were doing, 
because of course that run there 
was something that we weren’t 
looking forward to.”
Nobody 
exemplified 
that 
defensive prowess more than 

senior guard Akienreh Johnson. 
Coming off a strong defensive 
performance 
against 
Illinois 
where she tallied six steals, a block 
and two defensive rebounds, she 
was given the unenviable task of 
defending Spartan guard Taryn 
McCutcheon — the team’s best 
passer and second-leading scorer. 
During those eight scoreless 
minutes for Michigan, Johnson 
locked 
down 
McCutcheon, 
holding 
her 
to 
just 
four 
points and one 
assist. Like in 
her 
six-steal 
performance 
against 
the 
Illini, 
Johnson 
used 
her 
6-foot frame to 
suffocate 5-foot-
5 McCutcheon. 
“Akienreh is 
just an amazing 
defender,” Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico said. “And she was 
on McCutcheon all day and just 
did an incredible job.”
Beyond Johnson’s lockdown 
one-on-one 
defense, 
the 
Wolverines have gotten a boost 
from their consistent ability to 
rebound the ball. Their average 
rebound margin of plus-7.3 is 
second-best in the Big Ten and 
28th in the country. This level 
of rebounding limits opponents’ 
possessions 
and 
keeps 
them 
from 
getting 
second-chance 
opportunities.
That showed in a big way 

Sunday, 
when 
Michigan 
outrebounded 
Michigan 
State 
49-29 
and 
allowed 
just 
10 
offensive rebounds all game. Once 
again, that was a continuation 
of the Wolverines’ effort against 
Illinois, where Michigan won 
the 
rebounding 
battle, 
35-27. 
Hillmon, of course, has been 
most effective off the glass with 
10 and 13 rebounds in the last 
two games, but freshman center 
Izabel Varejão has 
also lent a hand. 
In just 17 minutes 
Sunday, she pulled 
in 7 rebounds — 
16.8 
percent 
of 
all missed shots 
while she was on 
the floor. 
“Hillmon was 
beating 
us 
up 
and 
down 
the 
floor,” 
Michigan 
State coach Suzy 
Merchant said. “We worked on 
that. We know what the kid can 
do. The shot goes up, you better 
have two or three people around 
her. She would just go and get the 
rebound, even in the second half.”
Those eight minutes without 
a field goal are a problem in their 
own right. As Michigan enters the 
Big Ten Tournament and likely 
the NCAA Tournament, it will 
only get harder for it to survive 
if it can’t avoid massive scoring 
droughts. 
But if it can’t avoid them, at 
least it has a defense that can help 
withstand them.

RISP struggles plaguing Michigan

Across the first six innings of 
Saturday’s game against Iowa 
State, the Michigan softball team’s 
offense 
was 
largely 
invisible, 
mustering only one run on five 
hits. And yet the Wolverines were 
staring down the last of the seventh 
inning, attempting to mount a 
furious comeback. 
The first three batters of the 
inning reached base. Down 5-1, the 
next hitter would both represent 
the tying run and signal the return 
to the top of the batting order.
Any cautious optimism that 
such a situation accrued, though, 
soon gave way to disappointment. 
Three consecutive baserunners 
were followed by three consecutive 
outs.
Ballgame. 
The fateful final inning against 
Iowa State was a microcosm of 
Michigan’s weekend failures at the 
dish. It painted an all too familiar 
scene of stranding baserunners on 
a weekend where the Wolverines 
hit at a lowly .214 (6-for-28) clip 
with runners in scoring position. 
In prime scoring opportunities, the 
bats were failing, making the lack 
of runs no surprise. Michigan was 
held to one run or less in three of its 
four games. 
These struggles have little to do 
with ability. Across the season’s 
first ten games, the Wolverines 
hit .300 (30-for-100) in the same 
situations — a far more respectable 
figure. 
Rather, 
according 
to 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins, 
it’s an issue rooted in mental 
inconsistencies. 
“I think it had to do a lot with too 
much being in their head, whatever 
was in their head,” she said. 
Added 
sophomore 
catcher 
Hannah Carson: “We may have 
been thinking about too many 
things.”
Admissions like these are not 
atypical of a scuffling softball team. 
Individual slumps have a tendency 
to spiral, snowballing into a greater 
problem. Players will often place 
added pressure on themselves to 
perform and send themselves into 

prolonged funks, estranged from 
their traditional approach at the 
plate. 
“Hitting 
is 
contagious,” 
Hutchins said. “When nobody hits, 
when people swing at bad pitches, 
it’s amazing. They catch it like they 
catch the flu.”
The first step of breaking out 
of a slump is diagnosing its cause. 
The Wolverines are confident 
they’ve done that. Figuring out 
how to tackle it is a different beast, 
but they believe they’ve found a 
solution to that too. 
“Just keeping the game simple,” 
Carson said. “Not worrying about 
who our competitor is and just 
focusing on one pitch at a time. Just 
using that will help to get the job 
done.”
One-pitch softball is a mantra 
that Michigan has embraced since 
the offseason. Its message stresses 
staying in the moment and places 
an emphasis on focusing on what 
the batter can control — the next 
pitch. 
The batter can’t control the 
situation she encounters. With 
the focus of one-pitch softball, 
situations like batting with runners 
in scoring position are meant to be 
ignored. 
It’s served as both a calling card 
and a crutch throughout the early 
portion of the season. Now, one-
pitch softball is an approach the 
Wolverines are making a concerted 
effort to rediscover.
“I don’t think there’s one-
pitch focus,” Hutchins said of the 
weekend. “Because what’s the 
difference between having runners 
on base and having no runners on 

base? The ball doesn’t know, the 
bat doesn’t know, well who knows? 
Well, the hitter knows.”
In practice this week, Hutchins 
had her players partake in what she 
calls a competitive hunting pitches 
drill. The players took turns 
batting and registered points when 
they hit the ball well; the ones who 
accumulated the most points would 
win. It’s a drill that embraces the 
basics — no situations, no outside 
noise. All the batter had to do was 
focus on hitting the ball. 
During 
bats 
with 
runners 
in scoring position, the batter’s 
attention might stray away from 
the single pitch, other thoughts 
clouding their head. The drill 
helps the Wolverines blot out these 
thoughts, better preparing them 
to hit with runners in scoring 
position. 
This simplicity to hitting is 
something Hutchins feels the team 
lost track of in stretches over the 
weekend. After a five-run outburst 
in the opening inning against 
Liberty on Sunday, for instance, 
Michigan seemed to have fixed 
its woes, only for nine straight 
Wolverines to be retired to close 
the game.
“All of a sudden, we have several 
innings in a row of poor at-bats, 
of out, out, out,” Hutchins said. 
“Getting ourselves out.”
A repeat of last weekend’s 
offensive doldrums is something 
Michigan can ill-afford, especially 
against the steeper competition 
that awaits in the Judi Garman 
Classic. It’ll soon be seen whether a 
re-emphasis on the basics of hitting 
pays any dividends.

Freshman Burton embracing cold weather

On 
a 
frigid 
winter 
day 
earlier this month, the Wilpon 
Complex came back to life 
after nearly eight months of 
dormancy. 
Through the steadily falling 
snow, the Michigan baseball 
team dashed back and forth 
between its locker room and the 
Oosterbaan Field House where 
it was holding a scrimmage. 
It was northern baseball 
at its finest. But in a sport 
dominated by teams from the 
South and West, it’s rare for a 
team running inside to practice 
to be nationally ranked at all, 
let alone No. 1 — where the 
Wolverines were ranked last 
week. 
Indeed, in the 40 years before 
Michigan’s run last season, 
teams from north of the 40th 
parallel only qualified for the 
College World Series 27 times 
out of a potential 328. Many 
recruits from baseball hotbeds 
are hesitant to leave their home 
regions and take the risk of 
playing in the cold.
Freshman 
third 
baseman 
Ted Burton, who hails from 
Huntington 
Beach, 
Calif., 
wasn’t one of them. 
“I wanted something new, 
and I wanted to step out of that 
California bubble that I have 
been part of my whole life,” 
Burton said. “I was looking for 
a different kind of people or 
even just a different experience 
and different setting, so I could 
see something new that not 
everyone gets to see.”
Michigan coach Erik Bakich, 
a California native himself, has 
an interesting tendency when 
talking about his players. He 
often goes out of his way to note 
that a player is from his home 
state. 
“Our California guys have 
always been able to get a lot of 
reps in,” he commented earlier 
this month when talking about 
Michigan’s 
characteristically 
chilly winter weather. 
Bakich has been effective in 
drawing non-northern players 
like Burton to Ann Arbor. Eight 

members of the Wolverines’ 
roster are from the Golden State, 
more than any other except 
for Michigan. He’s passionate 
about breaking the mold.
“It’s 
not 
just 
Michigan 
baseball 
but 
cold 
weather 
baseball, northern baseball in 
general where sometimes the 
perception is your program 
has been hidden under a rock 
or just hasn’t been relevant,” 
Bakich said. “It 
can be relevant 
… 
Sometimes 
you 
just 
need 
something 
magical 
to 
happen.” 
Burton, for his 
part, has bought 
into 
Bakich’s 
mindset. 
It’s 
evident in the 
way he avoids 
talking 
about 
himself and always defers to the 
team’s needs — a common trait 
for this group of players.
“I just want to be someone 
who will compete, play for 
the team and find a way to 
win, 
whether 
that’s 
laying 
down a bunt or putting a ball 
in for extra-base hits,” Burton 
said. “I’ll just do whatever is 
necessary to put us on top in the 

end.”
It was notable he specifically 
pointed to notching extra-base 
hits for his team, since doing 
so has been a challenge for 
the Wolverines this season. 
In its 8-5 win over Cal Poly on 
February 15 — a matchup the 
team will relive this weekend 
— Michigan didn’t have a single 
extra-base hit. 
In light of that, Burton noted 
the team needs 
to 
be 
more 
aggressive with 
its hitting. That 
means 
making 
contact 
with 
good 
pitches 
with less than 
two 
strikes 
and 
remaining 
effective 
with 
two 
strikes. 
At 
times, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
batters have struggled by letting 
those early pitches go to waste 
and then having to find any way 
possible to get the ball in play.
Once again, he was of the 
same mind as his coach. Bakich 
diagnosed the problem similarly 
after last weekend’s series loss. 
The two have worked quite well 
together since Burton arrived in 
Ann Arbor.

“He’s a great person … and 
he’s taught us a lot of life lessons 
along the way that I don’t think 
many people can,” Burton said. 
“He’s turning young boys into 
men.
“On the field he knows what 
he’s doing and you know damn 
well he’s going to bring out the 
best in you.”
Burton’s 
performance 
so 
far indicates he intends to be 
a presence at the plate. He 
knocked his first collegiate 
career home run in Saturday’s 
14-2 win over the Huskies.
On the infield, too, he has 
proven to be reliable. He’s 
worked well with the defense’s 
anchor, junior shortstop Jack 
Blomgren, as well as sophomore 
second baseman Riley Bertram 
to 
give 
the 
pitching 
staff 
adequate backup. 
Burton will have a chance to 
build on his strong start as the 
Wolverines head west to his 
home state for the next eight 
games. He sees the trip as just 
another chance to prove himself 
and validate his choice to play 
for Michigan.
“I’m excited and I’ll be seeing 
some old friends,” Burton said, 
“but I’m ready to compete and 
show 
them 
what 
Northern 
baseball is all about.”

‘M’ wins fourth-straight 
Big Ten conference title

Exactly a year ago, things 
were looking pretty great for 
Michigan’s women’s gymnastics 
team.
The Wolverines had taken the 
Elevate the Stage meet by storm, 
winning 
a 
third-consecutive 
regular season Big Ten title, 
earning the second best overall 
bars score in program history and 
then-freshman Natalie Wojcik 
scoring her first ever perfect 
10 with a Yurchenko 1.5 vault 
performance, the first given to 
Michigan on the event since 2011. 
You would think, logistically, 
nothing could top that weekend.
You would be wrong. 
Fast forward to this year’s 
Elevate 
the 
Stage, 
where 
No. 9 Michigan 
was not favored 
to win the meet 
against No. 7 
Minnesota, No. 
24 
Maryland, 
Penn State and 
Michigan State.
What 
they 
proceeded 
to 
do was nothing 
short of absolutely electric. 
“It 
was 
incredible,” 
said 
freshman 
Nicoletta 
Koulous. 
“We just felt that this was going 
to be a good meet for us.”
Michigan took the floor first, 
with Koulos in the leadoff spot 
scoring a career-high 9.850. The 
Wolverines continued to execute, 
with all scores in the event being 
at least a 9.850. Sophomore 
Natalie 
Wojcik 
(9.900) 
and 
freshman Gabby Wilson (9.925) 
both started streaks of four 
straight scores of 9.900 or higher. 
Michigan finished the floor event 
with a season-high 49.525.
The dominance continued on 
vault, where three Wolverines 
earned 
career-high 
scores. 
Sophomore Abby Heiskell scored 
a 9.925, Koulos landed a 9.900 
and sophomore Abby Brenner 
had a 9.950. Wojcik scored a 
9.950, as well, leading Michigan 

to another season-high with 
49.600.
A huge bars rotation extended 
the Wolverines’ lead and earned 
them their third season-high 
score this meet with a 49.400. 
Senior Maggie O’Hara scored 
a career-high 9.875 and Wojcik 
tied a career high to close off the 
rotation with a 9.950. 
Michigan finished the meet on 
beam. With the first three scores 
in the low 9.8s, Funk stepped 
up with a 9.900, and Wojcik and 
Heiskell both earned career-
highs with a 9.975 and a 9.925, 
respectively. 
“(Michigan 
coach) 
Bev 
(Plocki) told us to come in here 
and be sisters and have each 
others’ backs,” Koulos said. “And 
I think that’s exactly what we 
did.
“I just play my 
role on the team, 
and I do what I 
can to help. After 
my 
floor 
and 
vault, my job was 
to be the loudest 
I could be for the 
team.”
With an all-
around 
score 
of 
197.950, 
Michigan clinched its fourth 
straight Big Ten regular season 
championship, and Team 44 
wrote its name in the record 
books with a program-high score. 
“This meet just shows we’re 
definitely a team to be reckoned 
with,” Koulos said.
Wojcik finished the night with 
a 39.775, which is the seventh 
highest 
all-around 
score 
in 
program history and her personal 
career-high.
“Going into this meet, we 
knew it was the biggest meet of 
our season so far and we knew 
we were going to need to be one 
cohesive unit so we really focused 
on that,” Wojcik said. “We are a 
strong team no matter who is in 
the lineup.
“Today is everybody’s win – 
everyone who cheered for us and 
everyone who helped us along 
the way.”

‘M’ prepping for Badgers’ shooting

On Thursday night, styles and 
strengths will clash. 
The 
Wolverines 
welcome 
Wisconsin to Crisler Center in 
the two teams’ one and only 
meeting 
this 
season. 
While 
the Badgers may lack a top-25 
ranking and household name, 
they are currently tied for third 
in the Big Ten — a game ahead 
of Michigan in the crowded race 
for a double-bye in next month’s 
conference tournament.
One of the keys to Wisconsin’s 
success this year has been its 
3-point shooting. The Badgers 
rank second in the conference, 
behind only the Buckeyes, in 
3-point field goals per game and 
3-point 
shooting 
percentage. 
And, over its last five games, 
Wisconsin 
is 
shooting 
39.3 
percent beyond the arc. 
“It’s challenging,” Michigan 
coach Juwan Howard said. “They 
spread you out. They have guys 
who can make 3-pointers not just 
from a step behind the line but 
like two to four steps behind the 
three. It’s gonna be important 
that we guard the 3-point line 
and expect long rebounds.”
Guarding the 3-point line 
is something the Wolverines 
have specialized in this season. 
Howard’s 
extensive 
NBA 
background has unsurprisingly 
taught 
him 
the 
importance 
of 
limiting 
opponents’ 
opportunities behind the arc. 
He’s instilled that defensive 
thinking into his players this 
season — so much so that 
through the first half of the 
season, Howard refused to send 
help on opposing post players for 
fear of leaving open looks on the 
perimeter. 
So far it’s worked, as Michigan 
has allowed the 10th-fewest 
3-point field goals in the county 
and is holding opponents to just 
30.3 percent from deep. 
“Our guys are able to adapt 
with whatever the philosophy 
was 
before 
to 
this 
year,” 

Howard said. “We have smart 
players who have high IQ’s. But 
it takes a lot of reps and a lot 
of practice and film in order to 
grasp the defensive philosophy 
that I have.
“Our thing is we just want to 
make sure we get a hand-ball 
contest on every shot whether 
its inside the arc or outside the 
arc.”
Wisconsin will undoubtedly 
test the Wolverines’ competence 
in this regard. 
The 
Badgers 
don’t have one 
or two prolific 
sharpshooters, 
but 
rather 
a 
handful 
of 
capable 
ones. 
Five Wisconsin 
players 
have 
hit at least 25 
threes 
this 
season, meaning 
Michigan’s defenders will have 
to be on their toes at all times. 
“They do a great job of sharing 
the basketball,” Howard said. 
“They’re very patient when it 
comes to getting into their sets 
and running their offense. They 
want the defense to make a 
mistake. It’s important for us to 
be very disciplined defensively.”
The two teams also differ 
greatly from a tempo perspective. 
While Howard has encouraged 
his team to push the ball 
offensively and play a fast-paced 
brand of basketball, the Badgers 

are quite the opposite, ranking 
342nd in the country in adjusted 
tempo according to KenPom.
“Their pace of play stands 
out,” senior center Jon Teske 
said. “They play really slow. But 
they’re very efficient with what 
they do. They use the whole 
shot clock. They like to throw 
the ball down low and have 
very good bigs who are capable 
scorers. And if they don’t have 
anything they’ll throw it out 
to their 3-point 
shooters.” 
In 
what 
could easily be 
considered 
a 
trap 
game 
for 
Michigan ahead 
of 
its 
trip 
to 
Ohio 
State 
on 
Sunday, 
expect 
Wisconsin 
to 
try to lull the 
Wolverines 
to sleep before striking from 
beyond the arc. Thursday night 
will be a clash of strengths and 
styles — a clash Michigan isn’t 
overlooking.
“When the ball moves, we all 
move,” Teske said. “We know if 
someone makes a mistake, the 
next guy will be right there to 
step up. We trust each other to 
be in the right spots so we can 
get that defensive rebound and 
get out in transition and run.
“They’re very balanced on 
offense. It’ll be a challenge for 
us, but we’ll be ready for them.”

Morgan helping replace Lambert

Jimmy Lambert’s season was 
peaking at the perfect time.
When the second half of the 
Michigan hockey team’s season 
started, he was ready to put the 
past behind him. Lambert’s two 
years with the team have had 
their fair share of highs and lows. 
Last 
season, 
he 
led 
all 
freshmen in points despite not 
scoring his first goal until Jan. 11. 
His sophomore campaign started 
differently. Lambert netted a 
goal in just the second weekend 
series of the year. Then he hit a 
slump.
Three weekends ago, Lambert 
broke the floodgates open. With 
the Big Ten playoffs just around 
the corner, the timing of his 
upswing was critical. He tallied 
six points in the series against 
Wisconsin — five assists and 
one goal. But he also suffered 
an injury that caused him to 
miss the next weekend against 
Michigan State. 
“He just started to find his 
groove,” Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson said. “Obviously had the 
big weekend against Wisconsin, 
the big numbers, and then he gets 
hurt. And it’s just been a struggle 
for him to get back since then.”
Now with Lambert out for the 
season after getting injured again 
in Saturday’s game against Notre 
Dame, Pearson is staring face to 
face with a question that haunted 
him in the first half of the season.
Who’s going to step up in the 
absence of an injured player?
Pearson already knows the 
answer: redshirt junior forward 
Luke Morgan.
When Lambert missed the 
series 
against 
the 
Spartans, 
Morgan slotted into center with 
forwards Jake Slaker and Nick 
Granowicz on the wings.
Throughout 
the 
season, 
Morgan has rotated between 
both of the forward positions. 
In this situation, his versatility 
is his strength. It means the 
responsibilities that come with 

playing center opposed to the 
wing aren’t foreign to him, and 
the position switch is much 
easier and more seamless.
“It’s not too difficult,” Morgan 
said. “I do it a lot. It’s just making 
sure you’re back defensively 
more. Like in the corners of the 
D zone, winning battles there 
instead of staying up at your 
point. It’s just a small adjustment 
that you have to think about a 
little bit.”
But 
more 
than 
Morgan’s 
ability to easily fill the void at 
center left by Lambert, is how 
well his play compliments that of 
his new linemates. 
Slaker’s a shooter. He can 
put pucks on net and generate 
scoring chances. Granowicz is 
gritty; he works hard in front 
of the net and he’s not afraid 
of playing physically. Morgan 
brings speed.
“You’ve got all the things 
you’re looking for to have a 
successful line,” Pearson said. 
“You’ve got some experience, 
you’ve got some youth. (You’ve) 
got everything.”
Two 
weekends 
ago, 
the 
line 
proved 
itself 
against 
Michigan State in its debut. 
Slaker scored a goal assisted 
by his linemates. And Pearson 
knew 
the 
combination 
he’d 
thrown together was a suitable 
replacement for Lambert in his 
absence.
Besides 
Morgan’s 
quick 
adjustment to playing at the 

role of center, there are other 
aspects that have helped make 
the transition easier. Namely, 
familiarity with his linemates. 
This isn’t Morgan’s first time 
playing 
alongside 
Slaker 
or 
Granowicz. And with Lambert 
done for the season, it won’t be 
the last. 
In the upcoming series against 
No. 18 Minnesota, Morgan’s 
line will take the ice. Pearson’s 
confident in their chemistry. 
He’s also confident that the line 
playing on the big ice will be a 
benefit. 
Big ice means a bigger space 
to work with when moving the 
puck, especially in the offensive 
zone. More space means it’s 
harder for defenders to judge 
the angle at which to approach 
an offensive skater. This makes 
quick players like Morgan, Slaker 
and Granowicz harder to defend. 
After scoring only one goal last 
weekend against Notre Dame, 
the Wolverines need to find an 
answer on offense if they want to 
have home ice in the first round 
of the Big Ten Tournament. 
Pearson’s confident that Morgan, 
Granowicz and Slaker can help 
with that.
“I thought they played well 
at Michigan State together,” 
Pearson said. “They’ve been 
together before so they’ve got 
some continuity with them. I 
think the big ice, those guys all 
skate pretty well, that’ll be an 
advantage for them.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

“Diane, 11:30 am, February 24th. Entering the town of Twin 

Peaks,” FBI Agent Dale Cooper says into his tape recorder as fir 
trees flick past his car window.

Twin Peaks is a peaceful town. Quiet houses line the streets, 

lawns trimmed and protected by white picket fences. For those 
not working at the town’s massive lumber mill, there’s not much 
to do except have a beer at The Roadhouse or eat cherry pie at 
the Double R Diner alongside what Cooper celebrates as “damn 
fine” cups of coffee. The town has a picturesque sense of natural 
tranquility, conjured by tall trees, winding rivers and jagged 
mountain peaks. It’s, as Agent Cooper calls it, “where a yellow 
light still means slow down, not go faster.” 

Cooper is in Twin Peaks because a teenage girl was murdered. 
Laura Palmer was the homecoming queen, an English tutor, a 

Meals on Wheels and Special Education volunteer and beloved 
by everyone in town. Who could have possibly wanted her dead? 
This is the driving question of the show, a terrifying secret that 
unearths a thousand more. 

The first episode is 90 minutes, practically a feature film. For 

what initially seems like a murder mystery, most of the genre’s 
conventions are absent — the pilot focuses on introducing the 
small town and its citizens as the news of Laura’s murder rocks 
Twin Peaks. In the first scene, Pete Martell, an old man out 
fishing, stumbles upon Laura’s dead body washed up on a pebbled 
beach. As he calls the police, he breaks down in tears.

“She’s dead… Wrapped in plastic…”
From this first chilling scene, it’s clear that this sleepy hamlet 

is not prepared for the horror about to be unearthed. Laura’s 
two best friends, James and Donna, learn about her death in 
school; their small town’s sense of safety crumbles right in their 
homeroom. As they weep, a girl runs past the classroom window 
with her head in her hands, screaming. Soon, the halls are empty. 
In 2020, when American schools haven’t been safe for decades, 
this is even more disconcerting.

The worst grief comes from Laura’s mother who, throughout 

the first few episodes, is either weeping hysterically, staring off 
into space or, most horrifically, shrieking in the throes of surreal 
visions, like a visiting Donna’s face morphing into Laura’s and a 
ghostly man crouching under Laura’s bed, snarling. 

In the midst of this horror, however, there are surprising, off-

kilter moments of levity. In one scene, Agent Cooper and Harry 
Truman, the town’s sheriff, go to a bank to look at Laura’s safety 
deposit box. A gigantic, taxidermied deer head sits on the table, 
one eye looking right at the camera. Cooper and Truman stare 
down at it, intrigued. “Oh,” the bank clerk says, smiling as she 
enters the room. “It fell down.” Neither Cooper nor Truman 
respond and get back to work.

As Agent Cooper investigates, it becomes clear that Laura’s 

murder is just the tip of something vast, looming above the small 
town like the dark mountains that surround it. As if the murder 
mystery and quirky humor weren’t enough, there are also signs 
that something otherworldly haunts Twin Peaks. There are lights 
in the sky at night and dreams resurrect the dead, who have some 
dark secrets to share. We’re never given any sort of explanation 
about these paranormal events, with each hint only leading to 
more questions. What secrets lurk in the dark woods, under the 
towering fir trees? Nevertheless, the most horrific moments in 
the show are completely human, and they’re found in the domestic 
violence, teenage drug use and even sex trafficking that may be 
occuring in the small town. 

In the show’s most piercing 

moments, 
the 
comedy 
and 

horror mix. In episode three, 
Leland, Laura’s father, spins 
around to a 1920s swing song, 
clutching a picture of Laura, 
swirling faster and faster as he 
wails in grief. “We have to dance 
here,” he says in between deep, 
wheezing breaths as his wife 
tries to wrench the picture from 
his hands. “We have to dance for 
Laura!” They grapple with the 
picture and end up smashing it 
as the upbeat swing continues 
to blare. It’s completely heart 
wrenching, but also hilarious in 
an bleakly absurd, “laugh or cry” 
way that’s only found in “Twin 
Peaks.”

The show took the cop drama, 

the sitcom, the soap opera, a 
dollop of horrific surrealism 
and a hunk of “damn fine” 
Americana and blended it all 
together. It’s what a TV executive 
before its release called “Norman Rockwell meets Salvador Dali.” 

Something this complex was unheard of in the early ’90s, an 

era that also saw the premiere of “The Simpsons,” “Seinfeld,” 
“Law and Order” and “Beverly Hills 90210.” While these other 
shows left their mark, none of them had anything as audacious 
as the first few episodes of “Twin Peaks.” They told either self-
contained or serialized stories with clearly defined plots, without 
any of the ambiguity that makes “Twin Peaks” so enthralling. 
Most of those shows also dealt with fairly archetypal characters, 
while “Peaks” gave everyone, no matter how apparently minor, a 
complicated individuality.

This is especially apparent in the show’s women, who shine 

with strength, independence and wit even by today’s standards. 
Characters like Audrey Horne, a teenage femme fatale, and the 
Log Lady, an elderly woman who carries (and converses with) a 
log, constantly play off of the viewers’ expectations and remain 
some of television’s most complex, fascinating and unique female 
characters. 

The show’s creators, Mark Frost and David Lynch, brought 

a cinematic touch to every aspect of the production that still 
rings with quality. It wasn’t just that the writing was complex. 

Everything about “Twin Peaks,” from the cinematography to the 
set design, was constructed with care and bravery, creating an 
utterly believable and unique world. The soundtrack, by composer 
Angelo Badalamenti, is also superb, able to conjure both airy ease 
and deep, gnawing horror with an equal amount of power.

Notwithstanding its wild surrealism, “Twin Peaks” feels more 

true to life than conventional ’90s fare like “Roseanne,” “Cheers” 
or “Full House,” depicting American life in all its hilarious, 
horrific extremes with characters that leap from the screen. 

Cooper 
agonizes 
over 
a 
potential 
serial 
killer 
while 

simultaneously gorging on a donut buffet that covers an entire 
table. Bobby, a teenage football star, goes from flirting with 
waitresses at the Double R to participating in a cocaine deal in 
the dark woods, where someone pulls a shotgun. Audrey rebels 
against her father by playing loud jazz but also infiltrates a nearby 
sex ring in the hopes of finding Laura’s killer. 

While admittedly exaggerated, this contrast mirrors the highs 

and lows of the ’80s, still fresh in the minds of the show’s 1990 
audience. It was a decade of both horrific and joyful excess, an era 
of both Pac-Man and the War on Drugs, “The Breakfast Club” and 
the AIDS crisis. As the ’90s played out, this depiction only became 
more topical in the era of both Desert Storm and Powerpuff Girls, 
the end of apartheid and the O.J. trial. 

30 years later, “Twin Peaks” is still more wild and captivating 

than most shows currently on television. Plus, after “Peaks” 
ended in 1991, Lynch and Frost were far from finished. There was 
1992’s film, “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,” which told the 
story of Laura’s death, going all in on surrealistic horror. Then, 
miraculously, Frost and Lynch brought “Peaks” back for a third 
season in 2017 with almost every single cast member returning.

“Twin Peaks” is about America’s crushing dark side and the 

flickering light that rises to meet it, told through the lens of 
a small town in northern Washington. It’s about unanswered 
questions, both hilarious and horrific. It’s about the love found 
between people trying to do the right thing, and the terror that 
arises when some inevitably don’t. It’s about the wonder in the 
everyday, and the chilling thrill of things beyond reality. 

It really is, as Agent Cooper says, “damn fine.”

Thirty years later, ‘Twin Peaks’ is still damn fine

Tim O’Brien and the ’90s postmodern patient zero

Turn back the clock to the most unironic ironies, to halcyon days: 

a distant landscape populated with plaid and Dr. Martens-donning 
teens and tweens. Blockbuster stores are thriving, proudly located 
on Main Street. Simultaneously colorful and grungy, the ’90s 
represented a new counterculture rebellion, a relentless repudiation 
of the establishment and a universal truth. Emerging out of the 
hyper-consumerist ’80s and post-Watergate eras, young adults in 
the ’90s re-examined their relationship to their government, their 
corporations and their ideologies, morphing and adjusting their 
personal creeds accordingly. Feelings and emotions took precedence 
over fact in describing the new, increasingly gray, morally suspect 
world. The vaulted American Dream became less of an aspiration 
and more of an imposition. The ’90s marked the advent of accepting 
“truth” as subjective.

One can use O’Brien’s seminal work on Vietnam to observe a 

transition in American thought and belief. His work best encapsulates 
the ’90s disillusionment and ill ease with the establishment and 
mainstream narratives. No other written work holds government 
and ideology suspect like Tim O’Brien’s classic “The Things They 
Carried” (1990). The novel interrogates the notion of a universal 
“truth” and questions the institutions that claim to know what is 
“true.” His novel functions as a postmodern patient zero, a template 
by which secondary school teachers teach subjectivity.

After documenting and following a series of soldiers, giving 

insight into their personal narratives and war experiences, Tim 

O’Brien undermines his own “truth” with a legendary chapter titled 
“How to Write a True War Story.” Within that chapter, Tim O’Brien 
effectively promotes false truths and fiction as the best way to 
transmit experiences that cannot be put into words. He writes, “Often 
the crazy stuff is true and the normal stuff isn’t because the normal 
stuff is necessary to make you believe the truly incredible craziness. 
In other cases you can’t even tell a true war story. Sometimes it’s 
just beyond telling … True war stories do not generalize. They do not 
indulge in abstraction or analysis ... It comes down to gut instinct. A 
true war story, if truly told, makes the stomach believe.”

O’Brien’s insistence on sensory perception, claiming “the 

stomach” as the best truth receptacle, prioritizes feeling over fact. 

By manipulating and mixing fact and fiction in his novel, O’Brien 
establishes fact as fiction. The “crazy” truth requires the fictitious 
“normal stuff” to “make you believe.” There are no true facts in the 
same way that there is no truthful fiction. Everything and everyone 
is subject to subjectivity. 

O’Brien’s treatise on subjective truth would echo through America 

over the next three decades. 

The postmodern emphasis on feeling in “The Things They 

Carried” foreshadows 2020’s complete rejection of reality and 
objectivity. After the disruption of Vietnam, the emergence of video 
news and rampant financial uncertainty, the American public lost 
faith in objective truth. Objective truth, or the attempt to evoke 
truth as an unshakable, immutable value comes off as naive and 
shortsighted. As a patient zero, a taught template for understanding 
subjectivity, O’Brien’s work forecasted the success of fictitious 
truth and popularized it. The American public no longer finds the 
concepts of truth and facts persuasive. 

The erosion of objective truth is also in part 

due to the increase of news options available to 
the American public. In the ’90s, new television 
stations and news outlets emerged, changing 
the way “truth” and fact were projected to 
the American people. Originally, Americans 
received their news from a trifecta of three 
large media outlets: NBC, ABC and CBS. All 
news sources reported the same information. 
By the mid-1990s, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC 
fully emerged onto the scene, facilitated by an 
overhaul of telecommunication laws called the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996. With the cable 
industry deregulated, news channels became 
more targeted, laying down the architecture for 
the 21st century’s diverse and hyper-saturated 
news market. By the 2000s, cable news focused 
on emotional resonance as a more real and more 
representative “truth” than the “real” objective 
truth, manipulating interviews and statistics to 
provoke audience reactions.

Starting officially in 1996, Fox News radically 

changed the landscape of cable news. The 
network was created with the intent to present 

news with a specific narrative; a digestible, targeted analysis of 
headlines. One of its first shows, The O’Reilly Factor, was pre-taped, 
unlike previous live news programs. The producers were able to edit 
and preview the content. The show was ahead of its peers in tactically 
curating Fox’s nightly news for its audience, choosing provocative 
stories that promoted the network’s agenda. The channel’s nightly 
news concentrates on aggregating and sorting news, choosing which 
headlines and world events to highlight. 

This process of selected news cycles became more heightened in 

the 21st century, in which the rise of the internet and social media 
allows for a more rigorous and specialized curation of news. Now, 
in 2020, algorithms calculate an individual’s interest in content 
and news, providing the individual with more of their chosen 
poison. Individuals can easily and unintentionally self-segregate 
themselves. The Pew Center reports that 20 percent of Americans 
receive their news often from social media in 2018, a 2 percent uptick 
from 2016. This statistic is worrying, considering the subjective (and 
often untrue) reporting of modern platforms that prioritize their 
own specific “truth” and mission over any vague concept of what’s 
fair and objective.

The ’90s has a rocky relationship to objective “truth” as shown 

in Tim O’Brien’s novel. Though his investigation of subjectivity 
only explicitly applies to inexplicable concepts, such as war, the 
suppositions of his argument remain. 

Does an embracement of “gut feeling” best uphold authenticity? 

Does an objective truth exist? Does a subjective truth exist? Can our 
understanding of truth further deteriorate into uncertainty? These 
questions, raised in the 1990s, linger in the new age of American 
media that is heralded by technological innovation and ideological 
exhaustion.

For The Daily

“Twin Peaks” is about America’s 

crushing dark side and the flickering 
light that rises to meet it, told through 
the lens of a small town in northern 

Washington

By the 2000s, cable news focused on 

emotional resonance as a more real and 

more representative “truth” than the 

“real” objective truth

The vaulted American Dream became 

less of an aspiration and more of an 

imposition. The ’90s marked the advent 

of accepting “truth” as subjective


On Apr. 29, 2011, Catherine 

Middleton floated out of a retired 
Rolls-Royce Phantom VI parked 
directly in front of the main 
entrance of London’s Westminster 
Abbey. The morning wind caught 
her delicate veil as she rose to 
stand on the red carpet laid before 
her. Gracefully, she switched the 
hand holding her spring bouquet to 
adjust the flying lace. As she stood 
poised for her royal entrance, her 
sister calmly adjusted the dress’s 
seven-foot train. Crowds roared in 
response to the scene and the BBC 
announcers literally squealed. This 
wasn’t just the wedding of a future 
king — it was the launch of Britain’s 
21st-century monarchy. 

She entered the church at 11 

a.m., the sun barely offset from 
the top of the sky. In my California 
hometown, however, it was three 
in the morning. The 
sun hid quietly on 
the other side of the 
world and the night air 
rested silently in my 
backyard, but my TV 
whirred as it broadcast 
the event live from my 
family’s living room. 
I was certainly not 
the only preteen girl 
to pull an all-nighter 
that day in an effort to 
watch the Cambridge 
couple say “I do,” 
but 
nevertheless, 

popularity does not 
diminish 
impact. 

The new Duchess’s 
dress made my young 
heart melt. The layers of satin and 
lace and British poise composed a 
smooth cocktail of perfection that 
launched my continuing love for the 
Duchess of Cambridge. 

Two years later, Kate and Will 

stepped out of St. Mary’s hospital 
with 
newborn 
Prince 
George 

wrapped in a delicate white cloth. 
Kate wore a blue polka-dotted dress 
and the world applauded her for 
not trying to hide her postpartum 
body … but also wearing heels. 
Even through the small screen 
of a YouTube video, her mellow 
smile 
and 
long-fingered 
wave 

encapsulated the timeless elegance 
of the monarchy’s newest mother. I 
was hooked. 

I could go on. Her long winter 

coats on Christmas mornings. Her 
gowns at BAFTA awards and state 
dinners. Her sundresses on summer 
afternoons spent watching Will 
play polo (which is just about the 
most British phrase I’ll ever write). 
Her hats (actually, this one might be 

more British). Kate’s fashion is no 
doubt the strongest influence on my 
own wardrobe to this day, but not 
just for her clean lines of buttons, 
pleated skirts and sensible heels.

Through it all, her character 

shines through as a thoughtful 
mother and future queen. Her style 
is not avant-garde, but her activism 
is. She wears elegant coat-dresses 
while delivering poised speeches 
on mental health advocacy. She 
dons timeless evening gowns while 
pledging support for children’s 
physical education and classic 
blazers when promoting outdoor 
education. In essence, she is a 
picture of traditional beauty and a 
promoter of new causes. 

As my teenage mind formed this 

appreciation, however, I did not 
realize that Kate was not actually 
operating on her own. I did not 
recognize that her style was not 
completely hers, and her support 
for the underdog was not original. 
From the moment that her wedding 
veil caught the morning wind at 

Westminster Abbey, her existence 
fell under a melancholic cloud of 
royal legacy. 

I was not alive when Princess 

Diana died. I was born almost 
exactly a year after the fatal car 
crash that took her life in 1997 — 
still comfortably within the final 
decade of the 20th century but far 
enough toward the end to leave me 
questioning where I belong. There 
are many events that I’m told ended 
the ’90s — the loss of Princess Diana 
seems to be one of them. In my 
retroactive learning of her impact 
on England and the world, I see 
Kate’s story in a brand new light. 
The two women share far more 
than an engagement ring. 

Across the internet, fans place 

the two princess’s wedding attire 
side-by-side, pointing to similarities 
in their ivory color scheme and 
exaggerated dress trains. They 
talk about both couples’ use of a 
carriage after the ceremony and 
their equally iconic Buckingham 

Palace balcony kisses. After the 
birth of Prince George, the world 
spent weeks ogling the fact that 
both women had left the hospital 
in polka dots after their first born 
child. When Kate pulled on a red 
dress after welcoming her youngest 
child, fans lost their minds at the 
similarities to Diana’s reveal of Prince 
Harry in 1984. 

People point to gold accents on 

evening gowns and similar hat 
shapes at garden parties. They 
find 
shared 
fabric 
styles 
and 

color 
schemes. 
Sometimes 
the 

connections feel exaggerated, but 
the basis of them is not; Kate’s style 
is clearly influenced by Diana’s, 
and the world clearly loves it. 
This, of course, only encourages 
the Cambridge team to continue 
working under these influences, in 
and out of wardrobe. 

Princess Diana was the first royal 

to act as a non-royal mother. She 
took her kids to amusement parks 
and rode with them down the log 
flumes. Kate’s work with children 

today promotes those 
same values: love and 
nurturing. 
Princess 

Diana was the first 
British royal to touch an 
AIDS patient without 
gloves. She showed the 
world how to separate 
fear of an illness from 
fear of a person. Today, 
Kate visits hospitals 
and shelters to support 
those same values. She 
is a princess fulfilling 
the legacy of a woman 
whose potential was 
cut short. She is the 
re-launch of a show 
that 
was 
tragically 

cancelled 
and 
the 

sequel to a movie with a vicious 
cliffhanger. 

At the same time, I can’t help but 

wonder what this must feel like to 
her. Kate never met Diana, and yet 
the world often sees the two women 
as one. Does she enjoy the legacy, or 
does she ache for a moment that is 
entirely her own? I see myself in 
this question, too. Born in 1998, at 
the tail end of such a celebrated 
decade, I don’t know how to classify 
myself. Do I call myself a ’90s 
child — do I associate myself with 
President Bill Clinton and MTV 
and do I take Cher’s “Clueless” 
yellow suit as my own? Or do I 
learn about those years through the 
backward method of legacy as I did 
with Kate’s mother-in-law? What 
belongs to me, and what belongs to 
my predecessors? Frankly, I don’t 
have an answer. All I know is I find 
comfort in the fact that maybe, just 
maybe, this predicament makes me 
more similar to Catherine, Duchess 
of Cambridge.

Who 
could 
forget 
high 

school? 
The 
most 
glorious 

four years of any teen’s life, 
right? Full of perfectly tailored 
clothes, raging parties with 
choreographed dance numbers 
and the happiest endings to any 
and all love stories … Wait, is 
that not what your high school 
experience was like? Because 
all the high school romantic 
comedies of the ’90s sure set 
up those expectations for their 
teen viewers. 

In case you didn’t 

realize, high school 
isn’t exactly what 
these films say it’s 
like. 
There 
aren’t 

really 
jerks 
that 

turn over a new leaf 
once they fall head 
over heels in love 
with the first girl 
who rebuffs them. 
There aren’t perfect 
proms where Usher 
(yes, Usher) is the 
DJ. There aren’t bets 
to see if someone 
can make someone 
else fall in love with 
them. 
And 
there 

certainly isn’t valet 
everywhere you go. 

But, 
for 
some 

reason, all of the 
high school movie 
staples 
like 
“10 

Things 
I 
Hate 

About You,” “She’s 
All 
That” 
and 

“Clueless” have all 
of these unrealistic 
archetypes. 
Each 

character fits into 
one of these tropes; 
each movie has the 
mean Prom Queen, 
like Taylor Vaughan 
(Jodi Lyn O’Keefe, 
“She’s 
All 
That”), 

or the Lovable Brat, 
like Cher Horowitz 
(Alicia 
Silverstone, 

“Clueless”) 
and 

Bianca 
Stratford 

(Larisa 
Oleynik, 

“10 Things I Hate 
About You”), or the Innocent 
Virgin, like Annette Hargrove 
(Reese Witherspoon, “Cruel 
Intentions”) and of course the 
Benevolent Jock, like Zack 
Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr., “She’s 
All That”). Maybe you knew 
people like the Rich Asshole, 
like Joey Donner (Andrew 
Keegan, “10 Things I Hate 
About You”), or the Outcast, 
like Laney Boggs (Rachael 
Leigh Cook, “She’s All That”) 
or Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles, 
“10 Things I Hate About You”), 
but most of these tropes aren’t 
reflective of people you see 
in real life. And don’t forget 
the Token Black Friend, with 
countless examples throughout 
’90s teen movies, like Preston 
(Dulé Hill, “She’s All That”) 
or Chastity (Gabrielle Union, 
“10 Things I Hate About You”). 
People are placed into simple 
categories that make them one-
dimensional. Many of these 
characters are reduced to one or 
two main character traits that 
define their entire personality 
like their wealth, their race or 
even their sexuality in the case 
of Christian Stovitz (Justin 
Walker, 
“Clueless”), 
who 

quickly becomes Cher’s Gay 
Best Friend … after she stops 
trying to seduce him.

Along 
with 
these 

archetypes, there are token 
themes and moments in all of 
these movies, ranging from 
‘The Iconic Makeover’ to ‘The 
Heartbreaking 
Bet 
Reveal 

Scene’ to ‘The More Than A 
Little Disturbing Step Sibling 
Relationship’ (we’re looking at 
you, “Cruel Intentions”). While 
they might be entertaining 
to watch, they’re not exactly 
realistic. We don’t know about 
you, but things were much 
tamer in our high schools. 

And 
while 
these 
scenes 

and characters are so lovable 
onscreen, to say they haven’t 

aged well is an understatement. 
We’re primarily talking about 
the ‘Bet’ trope. While we will 
always love Patrick Verona 
(Heath Ledger, “The Dark 
Knight”) and his rendition of 
“Can’t Take My Eyes Off You,” 
we can’t quite condone his 
behavior in 2020. He and Kat 
may be a perfect couple to us, 
but the fact that he accepted 
a deal to try to get her to date 
him doesn’t reflect very well on 
his character. It may have been 
seen differently in the ’90s, 
especially considering the fact 
that “10 Things I Hate About 
You” was not the only film to 
feature a bet (see: “She’s All 
That” and “Cruel Intentions”), 
but 30 years later, it’s not okay 
anymore. 

Still, you can’t deny the 

talent 
that 
graced 
screens 

in the ’90s. Some stars in 
’90s movies made their way 
because of their status as ’90s 
staples. Sarah Michelle Geller 
(“Cruel Intentions”) was a 
big pull for creepy ’90s teen 
movies because of her role as 
Buffy in “Buffy the Vampire 
Slayer,” and Melissa Joan Hart 
(“Sabrina the Teenage Witch”) 

landed teen movies like “Drive 
Me Crazy” because of her TV 
fame. Prinze Jr. had a string of 
teen movies before “She’s All 
That,” which he is probably best 
known for. Silverstone went on 
to play Batgirl in “Batman & 
Robin” after “Clueless,” and 
Union followed up her stint on 
“She’s All That” with similar 
roles in “10 Things” and “Bring 
It On” in 2000 and beyond.

Some of these actors’ legacies 

extended far beyond the ’90s. 
Paul Rudd (who, miraculously, 
looks the same as he did in 
1995) has won over hearts for 
25 years, whether by fighting in 
the Marvel Cinematic Universe as 
“Ant-Man,” playing the recurring 
character 
Bobby 
Newport 
in 

“Parks and Rec” or 
being 
nominated 

for a Golden Globe 
for 
“Living 
With 

Yourself.” 
Joseph 

Gordon-Levitt 
has 

taken his adorable 
charm 
to 
films 

like 
“(500) 
Days 

of 
Summer” 
and 

even 
starred 
in 

“Snowden,” playing 
a version of Edward 
Snowden that was 
far too likable to be 
truly realistic. Heath 
Ledger went on to act 
in more sophisticated 
films like “Brokeback 
Mountain” and even 
won an Oscar for his 
portrayal of the Joker 
in “The Dark Knight,” 
which was received 
posthumously 
after 
his 
tragic 

overdose. And let’s 
take a moment to 
acknowledge Reese 
Witherspoon, 
who 

quickly rose to fame 
after her role as 
innocent Annette in 
“Cruel 
Intentions” 

and is now one of the 
highest paid actresses 
in the world, with an 
Oscar and countless 
major 
films. 
It’s 

incredible 
to 
look 

back at these films 
and realize the talent 
that 
was 
lurking 

beneath 
layers 
of 

baggy clothes and 

heavy eyeliner.

Teen movies in the ’90s were 

essential to the era, setting 
the 
tone 
through 
vibrant 

colors, playful plots and iconic 
characters. Most importantly, 
their 
reach 
has 
extended 

beyond the ’90s into our own 
generation as cult films and 
slumber 
party 
staples. 
We 

aren’t here to judge your love 
of these movies; in fact, we love 
them all just as much as anyone. 
There’s something about the 
cheesy plots and goofy lines, 
something 
charming 
and 

timeless, that has appealed to 
audiences for 30 years. Just 
remember as you’re watching 
these films that you’ve entered 
a new kind of high school 
experience, 
a 
fantasy 
land 

where teachers don’t assign 
homework if you couple them 
up and red solo cup parties in 
mansions never end with any 
real consequences. It’s a place 
where you can find your one 
true love in high school, as 
long as you take your glasses 
off first. But still, if you ever 
invite us to watch one of these 
films with you … well, let’s just 
say we’ll bring the popcorn.

Realistic representations 
of high school life? As if!

When we think of American culture in 
the ’90s, we don’t often think of Ireland. 
In fact, the origin of the most beloved 
music from the ’90s is often traced back 
to Seattle, Washington. Grunge pioneers 
were born below the city’s rainy skies — 
Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Nirvana — all 
of whom went on to shape the ’90s with 
their flannels and oversized jean jackets. 
While these bands have made major 
contributions to the music of the ’90s, the 

sounds we attribute to ’90s alternative 
music were largely influenced by Irish 
groups producing music amid political 
turmoil. Though these music groups 
are often overlooked in the grunge and 
alternative music narratives, they have 
helped shape our understanding of ’90s 
culture in major ways.
One of the most well-known and 
influential groups from the Irish music 
scene is The Cranberries, an Irish rock 
band formed in Limerick, Ireland. The 
group broke into American alternative 
music with their hit single “Dreams,” an 
eccentric, hopeful tune that introduced 
the world to the band’s unique twist on 
the Celtic rock tradition. Unlike other 
bands of its time, The Cranberries fused 
alternative music with their Irish roots, 
marked by the bellows from lead singer 
Dolores O’Riordan in her Irish brogue. 
“Linger,” a dreamy haze of a song, also 
topped the charts in the ’90s, again 
featuring O’Riordan’s superior vocal trills 
and accentuating the band’s nimble guitar 
performance. 
“Dreams” and “Linger” were pleasant 
introductions to The Cranberries, but 
the band later proved they were more 

than just a bunch of twenty-somethings 
chasing fame. In fact, their 1994 release of 
“Zombie” shattered the band’s mellowness 
and sparked much controversy in Ireland. 
The song, a seething protest against 
the 
IRA 
and 
the 
deaths of nearly two 
thousand 
civilians 
(including 
two 
young boys), is set to 
a raging, heavy drum 
part as O’Riordan 
almost pleads for the 
violence to stop. Over 
crunchy, 
distorted 
guitars, 
O’Riordan 
wails “what’s in your 
head, zombie?” and 
gets in touch with 
her 
raw 
emotions 
with 
a 
series 
of 
primal howls at the 
end of the song. 
Shortly following 
the 
release 
of 
“Zombie,” the band 
set out to create a 
music video, sending 
director 
Samuel 
Bayer to Northern 
Ireland to capture footage of the horrors 
of The Troubles. Naturally, both the BBC 
and the RTE rejected the video, opting to 
broadcast an edited version that mainly 
featured the band in a live performance. 
Despite their efforts to keep the original 
video out of view from the public, the 
initial footage prevailed and was watched 
more than 660 million times. On top of 
that, just a few weeks after the release 

of the song, the IRA declared a ceasefire 
after nearly 25 years of conflict. 
The 
Cranberries 
were 
musical 
revolutionaries, but their legacy spans 
far and wide, embedded into the pop 
culture 
we 
know 
today. 
We 
laughed 
when Andy yodeled his 
rendition of “Zombie” 
in “The Office” and 
we hummed along to 
“Dreams” as Meg Ryan 
babbled about online 
romance 
in 
“You’ve 
Got Mail.” 
My mom introduced 
me to the band when 
I was young, telling 
me 
stories 
of 
her 
beloved patent leather 
Dr. Martens and how 
Dolores 
O’Riordan 
inspired the women of 
her time to embrace 
their individuality and 
showed 
that 
women 
can do grunge just as 
well as men. Today, 
The Cranberries still 
make appearances in 
my playlists, and I’m taken by surprise 
every time I hear the roar of O’Riordan 
as she lays bare her edgy but open heart. 
The Cranberries have crossed oceans 
and reached audiences around the world 
with their radical spirit, and through 
their courage they’ve added an element 
of rebellion to the ’90s era, the kind that 
sparks change and inspires generations to 
come.

Thursday, February 27, 2020 — 4B

On this day in 1996, the very first 
pair of Pokémon games was released, 
kicking off what is now one of the most 
iconic video game franchises. The series 
was an essential part of my childhood. I 
remember being in the third grade and 
pestering my parents for weeks to buy 
me a copy of Pokémon Diamond because 
all my friends had it. There are few 
moments in my life that match the sheer 
excitement of starting the game for the 
first time, watching my mute, 8-bit avatar 
wake up and knowing that just outside 
his little bedroom, a world of adventure 
and endless possibility awaited. 
In that moment, I was at a new 
beginning. I felt this despite knowing 
that the game I was playing was just one 
iteration of a series older than myself. 
Though I’ve played most of the games 
since then, I never experienced the place 
where it all started, the foundation upon 
which an integral part of my childhood 
was built: Pokémon Red and Blue. Two 
weeks ago I decided to change that. I 
fired up a Game Boy emulator on my 
laptop, downloaded a copy of Pokémon 
Red from a shady website and began my 
Pokémon journey one more time. 
The rattle of a drumline punctuated 
by the immediately recognizable first 
notes of a trumpet that played over the 
opening cutscene sounded different in 
my mind than they did in real life. The 
tiny speakers on a Game Boy could not 
be expected to perfectly reproduce the 
sounds of these instruments, yet there is 
no way to listen to the music on the title 
screen and not hear a live marching band 
ready to follow you every step of the way. 
In that opening, there’s both a reserved 
humility and an understated promise 

of more to come — a promise Professor 
Oak confirms as he welcomes you to the 
world of Pokémon.
I picked Charmander as my starter, 
turned my back to Pallet Town and 
embarked on my journey through Kanto. 
Knowing what the game could look 
like with today’s advanced graphics 
didn’t makewalking through Viridian 
Forest any less daunting or battling 
monochromatic sprites any less exciting. 
I was ready to immerse myself in such 

dated graphics despite being able to 
turn on my Nintendo Switch and play 
an almost photo-realistic version of 
essentially the same game. I battled 
through all eight gym leaders, and, after 
some hard work, reached the Champion, 
my life-long rival, Blue. A subdued 
version of the opening music played 
as I waited to begin the final battle, a 
reminder of where it all began. 

Why am I able to feel such intense 
nostalgia for a game that I never played? 
Part of it may just be my nostalgia for the 
Pokémon series itself, but I think there’s 
more to it. There’s something special 
about playing an old game like Pokémon 
Red or Blue. Though the technology 
available by the time I started playing 
video games had theoretically rendered 
the 8-bit aesthetic obsolete, that same 
aesthetic became the basis for hundreds 
of contemporary games. Stardew Valley, 
Terraria, Undertale and the like all play 
on our shared nostalgia for the 8-bit role-
play game. The same aesthetic that was a 
limitation for the developers of Pokémon 
Red and Blue is now a worthwhile style 
in its own right. 8-bit games persisted 
and remained competitive with AAA 
titles whose scenes looked like they came 
out of a film. While one might be in awe 
at a screenshot from a cinematic moment 
in Grand Theft Auto V, no image from 
Pokémon Red and Blue in isolation will 
produce such an emotional response. 
Yet somehow countless people still feel 
a genuine sense of triumph when they 
finally get to wipe the smug look off 
their rival’s face as they claim the title 
of Champion. 
Games like Pokémon do so much with 
so little. A pixelated dark splotch may 
look nothing like a tree, but let yourself 
think it does and see how easily you’ll 
be lost in a forest of them. Pikachu’s 
thunderbolt may just be a flashing 
screen, but when it deals the final blow 
in a tightly contested battle, it feels 
explosive. It’s our imaginations that 
elevate these scenes to where we feel 
they are. The ’90s have thus produced, 
perhaps by accident, an ethos around 
video games that allows for an unlimited 
potential 
for 
emotional 
investment. 
Pokémon and its modern counterparts 
offer us the permission to imagine.

of 
homoerotic 
surrealist 
photographs. 
The 
landscape-style image portrays 
a 
conversation 
between 
two 
poles — to the 
left, 
a 
cherub 
cut out of marble 
looks down from 
his perch. His hair 
is fine and tousled 
as 
he 
reclines 
against the bed of 
heterochromatic 
flowers separating 
him and the devil 
to his right. His 
gaze flirts with 
his 
seemingly 
forbidden 
compatriot as he 
holds his finger up 
to his mouth in a 
shushing motion. 
A 
glib 
smirk, 
barely noticeable, 
sets the tone for 
the scene — these 
two 
know 
each 
other 
well, 
but 
they ought not to. 
The 
devil 
is 
separated 
from 
the cherub by the 
suspended sea of 
blooms, filled with 
what 
appear 
to 
be sprigs of sage 
and bouquets of 
peonies, 
which 
respectively 
signify protection, 
romance and death. He splays 
his 
outstretched 
fingers, 
extended by a set of black 
acrylics, across opposite sides 
of his chest, effectively covering 
what would be his modesty. The 
nails’ shape offset his razor-
sharp eyebrows and his quiffed, 
seemingly lacquered on hair 
(complete with a widow’s peak 
and the most cartoonish pair of 
sideburns one could possibly lay 
eyes on), while their brilliant 
sheen parallel his glossy red 
horns and the sparse smattering 
of emotionless tears. His gaze 
accepts that of the cherub, but 
he is not the aggressor in this 
scene. Rather, the work taps into 
and subverts the longstanding 
queer-coding of villains in art 
and popular culture. 
What’s implicit in Le Diable is 
a veiled, theism-tinged reference 
to both the dichotomy between 
the presumptive homosociality 
and homorotecism portrayed 
in 
modern 
culture 
and 
devalued forms of identitarian 
queerness, as well as the forms 
of desire that cannot be bound 
by 
those 
same 
identitarian 
lines, regardless of how many 
digitized plants are placed in 
between them. The Cherub, on 
the whole, encompasses all that 
comes with a privileged station. 
His 
colorless, 
marble-esque 
appearance harkens the kinds 
of saintly and angelic figures 
commissioned by those affiliated 
with the Papacy during the 
Renaissance. Though cherubs 

maintain 
their 
child-like 
appearance throughout their 
existence, this is not to suggest 
that they are perpetually young 
or that they are truly innocent 
or unknowing creatures, but 
rather that they maintain the 
illusion of an untainted youth 
due to their position within the 
celestial hierarchy. The effect 
of choosing the 
Cherub in this 
work to be the 
aggressor is not 
in the service 
of 
furthering 
notions 
of 
infantilization, 
a 
cultural 
practice 
that 
has the power 
to 
advance 
pederastic 
stereotypes 
that 
have 
been 
hurled 
against the gay 
community 
for as long as 
it 
has 
been 
established 
as 
a 
politicized 
category, 
but 
rather 
in 
reifying 
the 
power 
dynamic of this 
exchange. 
The 
cherub 
not only enjoys 
the 
power 
afforded 
to 
him 
by 
his 
association with 
a power much 
stronger 
than 
that of the (C.S. 
Lewis 
coined) 
lowerarchy, 
he maintains his superficial 
air of innocence as well. He is 
free to gaze and engage as he 
pleases, while those who share 
his likeness would be none the 
wiser. He is placed in a literal 
position of power as well, he is 
placed higher than the devil, 
and the casual, confident nature 
of both his body language and 
his expression is a confirmation 
of his agency. The devil in this 
image accepts not only the 
gaze of his aggressor, but his 
devalued status as well. He 
flirts back, but in such a way 
that shows a sense of meekness 
we would not expect from the 
agent of all evil. Despite his 
extreme features, he covers 
himself and lowers his chin, so 
as to appear more demure. The 
juxtaposition of the signifiers of 
his namesake and his outwardly 
demure, and subversively queer-
coded appearance. He is not 
what he seems, and neither is 
the Cherub. This landscape 
entails a symbolic attraction, 
not between youth and maturity, 
but in between those that 
enjoy the privilege of purity, of 
normativeness and those that 
must wear their sin on their 
sleeve. Through careful use of 
divine imagery, Pierre et Gilles 
create a language of attraction, 
even of love, that can be spoken 
between 
those 
who 
have 
barriers placed before them, 
while acknowledging dynamics 
of power that cannot be done 
away with in a flawed world.

They populate hallways of 

high schools across the country, 
sauntering to class in their 
flannels and flared jeans. They 
cry “like this if you’re a ’90s kid,” 
while bopping out to hip hop 
music on a vintage Walkman. 
These lost souls were “born in 
the wrong generation” and yearn 
for days gone by. Fixating on any 
time period from the 1960s to the 
1990s, these angsty teenagers 
often proclaim that the times in 
question were “better days” and 
that these past eras produced 
the last truly “good” music. 
Oftentimes, such individuals are 
dismissed by their peers as those 
kids who can’t stop talking about 
“My So-Called Life” or “Sabrina 
the Teenage Witch.” Of course, 
the ’90s saw events like Y2K, 
the OJ trial and a presidential 
impeachment. But we also have 
this decade to thank for beanie 
baby hoards, those slap bracelets 
that got banned and “Space 
Jam.” What if these displaced 
dreamers really were born in the 
wrong generation, and the past, 
particularly the ’90s, truly was a 
better time?

Stephen Chbosky’s “The Perks 

of Being a Wallflower” made me 
consider this question. Published 
in 1999, the epistolary tale takes 
the reader on a journey with 
Charlie through his first year of 
high school and “the world of 
first dates, family dramas, and 
new friends,” as stated in the 
novel. “Perks” is quintessentially 
’90s, filled with grunge, angst 

and feeling infinite. I am not a 
’90s kid, but Charlie’s experience 
truly resonated with me and 
brought me back to my own high 
school years. In many ways, 
his journey was my journey, 
and reading Chbosky’s novel 
reminded me of the loneliness, 
vulnerability 
and 
love 
that 

characterized my life. The story 
is transcendent and universal, 
“both 
happy 
and 
sad” 
and 

written from the perspective of a 
boy who is “still trying to figure 
out how that could be.”

You could say I was lonely in 

the ninth grade. Following the 
dissolution of a close friendship, 
and overwhelmed by my own 
nervousness, I had a difficult time 
making 
friends. 

I was quiet and 
shy, terrified by 
the prospect of 
talking 
to 
new 

people but racked 
with a yearning 
for 
human 

connection. 
It 

wasn’t 
a 
great 

phase 
of 
my 

life, but it was 
a formative one 
nonetheless. And 
Chbosky captures 
the 
essence 

of 
this 
period 

nearly perfectly. Early in the 
book, Charlie timidly befriends 
Patrick and Sam, both seniors, 
and becomes close friends with 
them. But before this connection 
is made, and after conflicts arise 
between the friends, Charlie’s 
isolation takes center stage. The 
hopelessness 
and 
rumination 

that 
characterized 
many 
of 

my days trapped alone in my 
head are depicted with a scary 
accuracy. At one point, Charlie 
is promised a call from his 
friend Patrick after a mishap, 
but Charlie doesn’t receive one. 
This one event begins to taint 
the rest of his thoughts, and he 
becomes increasingly distressed 
the more he stews in his own 
worries. That sort of poisonous 
anxiety, the kind that paralyzes 
you and seeps into the rest of 
your existence, is not new to me. 
That Chbosky is able to capture 
this inimitable feeling of nervous 
isolation only speaks more to the 
universality of his book.

Thankfully, much like Charlie, 

I was able to find truly life-saving 

friends during the 
ninth grade, and 
coincidentally, 
the 
friends 
I 

made as a ninth 
grader were all 
older than me as 
well. 
Emotional 

insecurity 
and 

anxiety don’t go 
away 
overnight, 

though, 
even 

with new friends, 
and 
growing 

into appreciating 
these 
friends 

is a process in 

and of itself. It’s a process of 
teenage growth that I haven’t 
seen 
depicted 
often. 
Here, 

“Perks” once again captures an 
aspect of my adolescence with 
precision and grace. Charlie’s 
quiet sentimentality is both 
beautiful and familiar. When 
Charlie is first invited to hang 
out with Sam and Patrick’s 

friends, I saw a part of myself 
in him. He passively intakes his 
surroundings, 
absorbing 
the 

presence of new, strange and 
wonderful people just existing. 
“That was me once,” I thought. I 
remember when I was invited to 
a house party for the first time, 
and though I wasn’t fed any pot 
brownies and we only listened 
to “Kidz Bop” while we face 
painted, my emotional state in 
those moments was similar to 
Charlie’s. Anything felt possible, 
and the depths of love ripped my 
chest open, baring my soul for 
whatever pain or joy might come. 

But I got much more time with 

my friends than Charlie does 
with his: My friends were only 
a year older than me, whereas 
Charlie’s are three years older. 
But this doesn’t matter, because 
even though Charlie’s journey 
of friendship with Patrick and 
Sam moved to a new stage much 
sooner than my journey did, 
both Charlie and I hold an acute 
awareness of the rarity and 
beauty of friendship. Our explicit 
acknowledgement and tranquil 
acceptance of the impermanence 
of these times amplified the 
highs of love and companionship. 

There were times when I became 
so acutely aware of how great it 
was to have friends that I simply 
cried out of joy and thankfulness. 
Such sentimentality is familiar 
to Charlie, and on this level I 
connected with him. I distinctly 
remember a moment driving 
home from my friend’s house in 
the eleventh grade. It was the 
last year everyone in our friend 
group would all be in high school, 
and graduation was approaching 
quickly. I came to a stoplight 
and considered this fact for the 
thousandth time, but while I was 
thinking, a pretty song came on. 
I don’t remember the song, only 
that it was one I recommended to 
one of my friends. But I remember 
that I just started laughing. Then 
crying. Love washed over me, 
and I reflected on all the times I 
felt infinite with them.

I still reminisce on these 

times, but coming to terms with 
the passage of time helped me 
grow beyond who I was before 
I met these people. I am still 
awkward and shy, and sometimes 
I avoid going to the same hair 
stylist more than once because 
I have already asked them 
every question in my arsenal 

the first time they cut my hair. 
But I am not afraid anymore. I 
carry on with the memories of 
those I love in my heart. Steven 
Chbosky’s “The Perks of Being 
a Wallflower” is transcendent, 
and it spoke to me and my 
experiences over two decades 
after it was originally published. 
Each generation is defined by 
the culture in which they grew 
up in. The hippies of the ’60s, 
the angsty adolescents of the 
’90s, the political revolutionaries 
of the 2010s. It is inevitable, 
necessary, even, to move beyond 
the past, but there is also value in 
what has been lost. “The Perks 
of Being a Wallflower” reminded 
me of this. So slip into those Dr. 
Martens and that flannel and 
jam out to some Salt-N-Pepa, 
and embrace being born in the 
wrong generation. Embrace the 
ability to look back on remnants 
of times gone by while still being 
able to appreciate what made 
those times special. The wisdom 
to be found in them is timeless. 
“Perks” in particular reminds 
us all to be aware of limitless joy 
and opportunity, and, most of 
all, helps us to remember to feel 
infinite.

The perks of being a ’90s 
kid: Chbosky’s timeless novel

SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT

The 
World 
Wide 
Web. 

Scrunchies. 
Y2K. 
Pogs. 
The 

Clinton-Lewinsky 
scandal. 

Sitcoms. Need I say more? It’s the 
’90s. 

Many of my contemporaries and 

I were either unborn or too young 
to soak in the iconic ’90s culture 
that oozed out of every fleeting 
moment, but that doesn’t seem to 
matter too much. The ’90s, while 
we may never truly relive it, is still 
so culturally relevant nearly two 
decades later that it doesn’t feel 
like we missed out on anything. 
Scrunchies came back in full force, 
Dr. Martens might never go away 
and you can hear iterations of “I 
did not have sexual relations with 
that woman” in nearly any reality 
TV show or celebrity scandal 
today. 

The unambiguous nature of the 

’90s makes it easily imitated today 
and many aspects of pop culture 
take advantage of this fact. Shows 
like “Bojack Horseman” have 
created picture-perfect parodies 
of the classic ’90s situation comedy 
format through “Horsin’ Around,” 
a template for what these shows 
used to offer to the community. 
Through its simple yet precise 
usage of “live” studio audiences, 
cheesy catchphrases and limited 
filming sets, the essence of iconic 
sitcoms like “Full House” and 
“Family Matters” are flawlessly 
captured. For those who grew 
up with them, this combination 
of features elicits warm feelings 
of nostalgia and coziness. You’re 
bundled up on the couch with your 
preferred sitcom on, humming 
along to the theme song, knowing 
that no matter what conflict arises 
in this episode, everything’s going 
to be okay in about half an hour. 

And yet, there’s a level of harsh 

reality that simmers beneath the 
feel-good appearance of sitcoms. 
This optimistic facade is the 
illusion that modern television 
has tried to take down. We’ve 
entered a phase in our culture 
where mindless consumption is 
frequent yet frowned upon, and 
many new shows have tried to 

incorporate social commentary 
into their plot lines to make 
television consumption a little 
more meaningful. Shows like 
“Bojack” centered their entire 
plot on how unrealistic the idea of 
quick conflict resolution is in real 
life. Hardly anything in real life is 
ever resolved within a half-hour 
time span, and these shows know 
this. A lot of us do too. Yet sitcoms, 
especially those made in the ’90s, 

gained so much traction and are 
held close to the hearts of many to 
this day. Why is this?

Simply 
put, 
sitcoms 
are 

comforting for the very reason that 
makes them criticized by modern 
audiences. Their lack of realism, 
in the wake of decades of war and 
uncertainty, provided a source 
of repetition and structure that 
people lacked in their day-to-day 
lives. Superficially, most people 
only 
remember 
the 
positives 

when it comes to the ’90s. That 
is, the Spice Girls, barrettes and 
“Clueless.” 
We 
often 
ignore 

the negative things — like war, 
genocide and the Los Angeles 
riots — that likely brought about 
the necessity of these positives. 
There’s a reason why people 
needed sitcoms to distract them.

Reality 
television 
plays 
a 

similar role in modern society. 
When it comes down to it, nothing 
that happens in either genre is 
necessarily groundbreaking or 
surprising. They both take place 
on someone’s couch, kitchen island 
or bar down the street. Most of 
the episodes are predictable and 
the plotlines are shallow. If there 
is any deeper meaning, it’s subtle 
and hidden under layers of petty 
drama and clever quips. It’s this 
consistency we often look for 
when we’re in times of distress 
— similar to how I crave shows 
that I’ve already seen when life 
becomes just a little too much. 
Distraction is a coping mechanism, 
and “woke culture” tries to make 
us feel guilty about this very 
natural phenomenon. To a certain 
extent, there’s not much we can do 
about the macro, uncontrollable 
dangers we face at every waking 
moment. We can tote around our 
reusable straws and take shorter 
showers, but what is there to do 
about nuclear war? About natural 
disasters?

In recent decades, we have been 

faced with so much change and 
imminent doom (which I know 
aren’t exactly new) that we’re 
left with two options: choose to 
remain blissfully ignorant, or 
take on large-scale burdens like 
they’re our own. Most people, 
understandably, 
choose 
the 

former. These shows transport 
us to a world we wish we could 
live in, where our most difficult 
problems are having two dates to 
the dance or not having a jacuzzi. 
And change, whether positive or 
negative, is constant and difficult 
for anyone to endure too much 
of. I’m certainly not suggesting 
that you hole up and mindlessly 
consume until your brain melts, 
but don’t feel so guilty about 
ignoring the tick tick ticking of the 
Doomsday clock by watching a bit 
of brainless television. Sometimes 
all we need to cope is a half-
hour episode of television where 
likeable and predictable characters 
chat around the dinner table and, 
no matter what, no matter how 
nasty things get, everything’s 
going to be okay.

‘Last Week Tonight’ makes 
sense of the political chaos

Last Week Tonight

“Welcome! 
Welcome! 

Welcome!” John Oliver exclaims 
with his signature opener as he 
introduces his newest season 
as host of HBO’s “Last Week 
Tonight.” Over the past seven 
years, 
the 
late-night 
comedy 

program has become known 
for its savvy political satire, 
cementing itself as a staple of late-
night comedy. In its first show 
of the new decade, Oliver was 
quick to note what global events 
transpired during the show’s 
nearly two-month hiatus: “We 
nearly went to war with Iran, 
the UK elected ‘BOJO’ Prime 
Minister and the Coronavirus 
has started spreading around the 
world, and if you happen to feel 
like you’re getting sick right now 
you DO have it and you only have 
hours to live.”

“Last Week Tonight,” more so 

than other late-night programs, 
has been able to maintain a 
steady, high-quality production 
of informational comedy through 
formatted segments that debut 
every 
Sunday. 
The 
show’s 

noticeably consistent strengths are 
its larger segments, those which 
tend to grapple with relevant 
issues without sacrificing comedic 
material. In a late-night landscape 

where seemingly every comedian 
has a Trump impression, Oliver 
and his writing staff lay off the 
easy dunks in order to make an 
even greater political statement. 
While the show’s segments can be 
bleak in topic, each weekly piece 
intends to expand upon a political 
issue that may be unknown to the 
general public. In past seasons, 
segments have created social 
action that has ranged from 
harassing FCC commissioner Ajit 
Pai over net neutrality to a highly-
publicized legal battle with a West 
Virginia coal CEO.

From the vantage point of 

February 2020, there is still 
no guarantee that HBO will 
renew “Last Week Tonight” for 
additional seasons. HBO has 
been generous to give “Last Week 
Tonight’s” 
creators 
expanded 

agency in the show’s production. 
Oliver has expressed that he 
has 
“full 
creative 
freedom, 

including free reign to criticize 
corporations.” After all, HBO is 
owned by AT&T. Whereas conflict 
of interest could present an issue 
when discussing the prevalence 
of matters like robocalls or joking 
about the demise of “Game of 
Thrones,” (which also aired on 
HBO), 
“Last 
Week 
Tonight” 

maintains its “No B.S.” slant. 

In particular, his new season 

represents a turn for the series as 
John Oliver recently obtained dual 

citizenship with the United States 
and the United Kingdom. While 
the question of Oliver’s citizenship 
was never an important factor 
in his expertise as a host, his 
backstory as an immigrant sets 
his comedic backstory apart. His 
new American identity grants 
a more personal, caring tone 
than in seasons past. Despite 
the inherently depressing flaws 
of American society which he 
carefully lays out every week, 
John Oliver believes he is a patriot, 
holding a soft spot for the ideals 
and pursuits of a more perfect 
union. “It was a big deal,” he stated 
in a recent interview with Stephen 
Colbert on “The Late Show,” 
“not just choosing America, but 
choosing America NOW.” The 
landscape for this year’s season 
of “Last Week Tonight” should 
present 
many 
ripe 
prospects 

with the inevitable fallouts from 
Brexit, the summer Olympics in 
Tokyo, the upcoming Democratic 
National 
Convention 
and, 
of 

course, the Presidential Election.

How Oliver intends to use 

his new perspectives from U.S. 
citizenship in order to engage 
audiences is sure to be provocative 
and hilarious, culminating in the 
continuation of the finest that 
satire television currently offers. 
That’s just so long as Ajit Pai and 
the FCC have nothing else to say 
about it.

great, but we needed them

It is inevitable, 
necessary, even, 
to move beyond 

the past, but 
there is also 
value in what 
has been lost


On July 3, 2011, I anxiously 
awaited 
my 
letter 
from 
Hogwarts. I had been preparing 
for this fateful day for years. I 
had already procured my coveted 
rosewood wand from a website 
promising 
“one-of-a-kind” 
custom wands and a shining 
black robe that was admittedly a 
bit too small, having purchased 
it years ago for my fourth grade 
Ginny 
Weasley 
Halloween 
costume. But on my 11th birthday, 
the time for my Hogwarts letter 
had finally arrived. To my bitter 
disappointment, 
that 
letter 
wasn’t in the mail on my birthday, 
but I didn’t lose hope. They must 
have made a mistake, I thought. 
It wasn’t until September 1 when 
I dreamed sadly of the train 
leaving the station on Platform 
9 ¾ and accepted my mundane 
Muggle existence. 
I wasn’t alone. Countless kids 
experienced heartbreak when 
the heavy, yellowing envelope 
didn’t appear like magic on 
their doorsteps come their 11th 
birthdays. For many, the “Harry 
Potter” 
world 
stretched 
far 
beyond the pages of the books 
and enchanted kids of all ages to 
believe in the hidden Hogwarts 
castle, nestled in the rolling 
hills of the Scottish highlands. 
I grew up in a generation where 
it was rare to meet someone 
who hadn’t read the “Harry 
Potter” books or at least seen 
the movies. I, like many of my 
friends, experienced the joy of 

this magical literary world in 
my elementary school years and 
spent much of my youth seeking 
out similar magical adventures 
in other fantasy series like 
“Divergent,” 
“The 
Hunger 
Games,” “Percy Jackson” and 
“Twilight.” The fantasy series 
was the core of my early reading 
career and dominated the young 
adult literary community at the 
turn of the century. This literary 
culture shaped my experiences 
growing up in the 2000s, but its 
roots trace back to the ’90s — to 

a changing American culture 
that opened doors for more 
fantastical novels like “Harry 
Potter.” 
The first in the seven-book 
series, “Harry Potter and the 
Sorcerer’s Stone” (or “Harry 
Potter and the Philosopher’s 
Stone,” as the most devoted 
“Harry Potter” fans know it was 
originally called), was released in 
1997. The story behind its release 
is legendary: the idea came to 
J.K. Rowling during a train ride 

to London’s King’s Cross and 
over the next five years, she 
wrote this soon-to-be wildly 
popular series on scraps of paper 
and in long-form writing. When 
she tried to get it published, 
however, she was turned down 
again and again. Publishers told 
her no one would be interested 
in reading books about a magical 
make-believe world. 
After finally finding a receptive 
publisher, 
Rowling’s 
fantasy 
series took the world by storm, 
and it was immediately clear that 

the doubtful publishers could 
not have been more wrong. The 
books were so wildly popular 
that in 1998, before books three 
through seven had even been 
published, Rowling sold the film 
rights for the first four “Harry 
Potter” books to Warners Bros 
for almost 2 billion dollars. 
Evidently, the public was ready 
for a new wave of fantasy novel 
mania. 
For many of us, their initial 
hesitation seems unthinkable. 

The idea that such a cherished 
series of books, one that shaped 
much of my life growing up, 
might not exist today if Rowling 
had heeded the initial negative 
feedback and abandoned the 
idea, quite honestly terrifies me. 
Why did a book series that has 
now generated over 7.7 billion 
dollars in revenue and captured 
the hearts of people of all ages 
worldwide 
inspire 
so 
little 
confidence in publishers in the 
late 1990s?
In truth, fantasy novels were 
less than popular in the ’90s. 
Books about real life prevailed 
over fantasy novels, and most 
people lost interest in stories not 
rooted in reality. Discussion of 
fantasy books brought to mind 
older books like “The Chronicles 
of Narnia” (published between 
1950 and 1956) and “Lord of the 
Rings” (published between 1954 
and 1955), but few contemporary 
varieties found their way to the 
top of reading lists. These books 
had seen their glory days, but 
by the 1990s they were simply 
viewed 
as 
old-fashioned. 
In 
short, the fantasy novel genre 
remained 
mostly 
stagnant 
over the course of the ’90s. 
Meanwhile, American culture 
flourished and happiness levels 

were at an all-time high. After 
the fall of the Berlin wall, life 
felt electric, like anything was 
possible. Maybe this is a clue 
as to why fantasy novels had 
fallen so out of style. Fantasy 
novels provide an escape from 
the mundane world, a way to 
detach from reality. The most 
successful fantasy books are an 
immersive experience where, for 
a short time, the real world fades 
away, and an illusion of magic 
and adventure takes over. Maybe 
in the early ’90s people felt no 
desire to depart from reality. 
Why should they, when they 
had a unique culture of music, 
TV and arts at the tips of their 
fingers in the real world? We can 
only speculate. 
Nevertheless, as the decade 
drew 
to 
a 
close, 
anxieties 
surrounding the beginning of 
the 21st century took hold. With 
an explosion of technological 
innovations came fears about 
what uncertainties the future 
held. The world was changing, 
and for many, this fact fostered 
unease. This could explain why 
“Harry Potter” blew up the way it 
did. People were scared, and they 
needed an escape. The series was 
already genius to begin with, but 
the receptive minds of people in 

the late ’90s, young and old alike, 
offered the perfect conditions 
for an explosion of popularity 
that no one could have foreseen. 
After “Harry Potter,” people 
were hooked. No one could get 
enough of the enticing escape 
into a fantasy world, hence the 
skyrocketing demand for fantasy 
novels in the early 2000s. Within 
the next ten years, writers 
caught on to the trends, and 
countless fantasy books graced 
the shelves, ready to be devoured 
by the eager public. 
The turn of the century kicked 
off a new literary era defined by 
the fantasy series, and its effects 
are still felt. Every few years, like 
clockwork, a new story joins the 
long line of fantasy powerhouses. 
This development transcended 
the realm of books, influencing 
other media forms in recent 
years as well. Most recently, the 
TV show “Game of Thrones” 
swept the United States up into 
the latest craze. The show had 
people of all ages staying up 
into the late hours of the night, 
putting their lives on hold to 
blow through eight seasons of 
thrill and uncertainty. Evidently, 
the escape from reality remains 
a welcome comfort in people’s 
lives.

‘Harry Potter’ and the late 
’90s fantasy series craze

B-SIDE: BOOKS

This literary culture shaped 
my experiences growing up in 
the 2000s, but its roots trace 
back to the ’90s — to a changing 
American culture that opened 
doors for more fantastical novels 
like “Harry Potter.”

It might be on a somewhat 
warmer winter day, with the 
miraculous force of the bright, 
warm winter sun, that you 
question the concept of home at 
perhaps the most unlikeliest of 
places: the intersection of Main 
and Liberty Streets — the heart 
of the fine dining restaurant 
scene in Ann Arbor. 
Regional cooking, especially 
for those not native to Ann 
Arbor, may very well serve as 
the baseline, idyllic conception 
of home. A non-fussy yuxiang 
eggplant could be the hallmark 
comforter for those displaced 
from Flushing, New York or 
cities such as Chengdu within 
Sichuan province proper. The 
simple 
pupusa 
might 
make 
you pine for the comfort and 
hospitality of an El Salvadorian 
cafe 
most 
common 
across 
pupuserias abundant at Pico 
Boulevard 
of 
Los 
Angeles. 
Regional cooking, while not 
entirely well represented across 
Ann Arbor, are commonplace 
enough to satisfy your cravings 
for what you’ve been missing 
while you are away from home.
But there is a case to be made 
for the variety of restaurants 
that 
might 
not 
reflect 
the 
cooking endemic to a specific 

region. These restaurants may 
not blast radioactive amounts of 
Scoville units that miracuously 
bring balance to their dishes. 
They may not serve waterfalls 
of intestine soup that can only 
be described as “dank of the 
highest quality.” Some of these 
establishments might be ones 

which you simply dismiss as 
“fusion.”
Pacific Rim by Kana is among 
the latter of these restaurants — 
one that captivates some with 
its 
Pan-Asian 
theme 
while 
disgusting others who abhor 
the amalgamation of different, 

supposedly 
sacred, 
regional 
cuisines.
Residents of the ’90s may 
remember 
that 
Pacific 
Rim 
was once a Korean restaurant 
called Kana, well known for its 
signature strong ginger tea and 
dak bokkeum — a spicy Korean 
braised chicken dish analogous 

to the warming, comforting 
powers of a chicken paprikash. 
Kana, named after the Korean 
word meaning “to go” or “are 
you going,” was once a small 
stand near the U-M Medical 
Campus before moving to their 
current 
location 
at 
Liberty 

Street. Owners Byung Dok and 
Kun Hi Ko ultimately passed 
their restaurant to their son 
Y.B. Ko, who partnered with 
now chef-owner Duc Tang to 
reinvent Kana into Pacific Rim.
The reinvention of Kana into 
Pacific Rim was a transformation 
from that of a Korean diner-
esque eatery into that of fine 
dining. 
“Pan-Asian” 
consists 
primarily of East and Southeast 
Asian 
dishes 
prepared 
and 
plated with French techniques. 
Tang’s 
dishes 
superficially 
resemble popular dishes of the 
’90s and 2000s — though the 
influences from and ties to Kana 
are unmistakable. 
A cursory glance at Pacific 
Rim’s Japanese-style sablefish 
immediately identifies one of 
the dish’s roots — sablefish, or 
black cod, was popularized by 
Nobu Matsuhisa during the 
’90s, a variation of a Japanese 
marinating technique utilizing 
sake lees. A sablefish is an ugly 
fish unrelated to the cod that 
is commonly found in braised 
Korean or Japanese dishes. 
Sablefish is quite similar to the 
Chilean sea bass; both share 
an incredibly soft, tender yet 
flaky meat that seems to be 
near impossible to overcook. 
Thankfully, unlike the Chilean 
sea bass that has been overfished 
due to the popularity of that one 
Jurassic Park scene, sablefish 
is a sustainable alternative, 
though still relatively pricey. 
Ordering 
Pacific 
Rim’s 
sablefish will get you a sweet, 
heavily browned piece of moist 
fish — the bare whispers of 
bitterness from some portions 
of the over-caramelized skin 
provides 
a 
much 
needed 
relief from the sweet-savory 
marinade that coats the gushing 
flakes of sablefish. The light 
tang provided by the tamarind 
within the soy glaze provides 
an 
excellent 
foil 
to 
what 
could otherwise be a stolidly 
sweet and savory dish. Nobu’s 
dishes are well-known to be 
showstoppers due to his Nikkei 
Peruvian roots — and Tang’s 
version of the sablefish might 
very well be a sexy black-tie 
version of a ’90s classic.
But when you order the sablefish, 
the fish is complemented with 
a coiled pile of japchae — glassy 
Korean noodles stir-fried with 
a medley of napa cabbage and 
shiitake mushrooms. You’ll find 
that unlike many renditions of 
japchae you may find across Ann 
Arbor’s Korean restaurants, the 
japchae served alongside your 

sablefish is neither soggy nor 
mushy. Your vermicelli noodles 
possess the al-dente bite coveted 
by Italians and Italian Americans 
— yet possesses a vivacious spring. 
You’ll find that napa cabbage and 
the noodles provide a necessary 
textural contrast to your fish.
The japchae tells as poignant 
of a story as the fish. The fish 
might provide you the context of 
Tang’s worldly experiences and 
skills, but the japchae proves 
Tang as a worthy successor to 
Kana’s rich history as one of 
Ann Arbor’s local providers of 
Korean cuisine. 

Tang doesn’t fixate himself 
on the label of authenticity: 
his coconut-curry soup defies 
judgment as the soup lends 
itself equal characteristic of a 
hearty American root/squash 
soup as it does to a somewhat 
muddled Thai green curry. Is 
it heartwarming because of the 
innate resonance of consuming 
winter 
squashes 
and 
root 
vegetables during the winter, or 
because of the dry whispers of a 
herbal curry paste slivering past 
the 
impassive 
squash/sweet 
potato puree? It’s hard to tell, 
but you find yourself ignoring it 
— the soup is heartwarming.
You have two choices to round 
out your meal: a well-executed 
chocolate lava cake that is warm 
and fluffy on its exterior as it 
is piping hot and luscious in its 
interior. The coconut ice cream 
provides a nutty quality to your 
overall experience while the 
macerated 
cherries 
provide 

exciting tartness to an otherwise 
somewhat monotonously sweet 
dish. Eating Tang’s chocolate 
lava cake is a reminder of how 
innovative and genius the dish 
was in the ’90s — a delicious 
trio of string players whose 
performance is best seen live 
as opposed to experiencing the 
dreadful butchered renditions 
found at every chain restaurant 
and diner littering the Midwest.
But 
the 
ginger 
tea 
— 
unaltered from the drink found 
at the original Kana — might 
provide a lingering conclusion 
to your meal compared to the 

lava cake. Pungent through the 
spicy tartness of the ginger, 
the inclusion of the apples 
and jujubes brings a fruitiness 
that ever so gently tempers the 
ginger. A drink such as this is the 
perfect nasal-busting beverage 
for 
the 
wintery 
outdoors. 
Drinking the tea passed down to 
Pacific Rim from its predecessor 
Kana is as much a nostalgic 
conclusion to your meal as it is 
a curative drink that prepares 
you for the cold weather outside. 
The hospitality of Kana fills you 
in one last time before you have 
to leave.
Is it possible that Pacific 
Rim’s dishes might not speak 
to your conceptions of home 
after you finish dining? Perhaps 
not; your past life experiences 
may vastly differ from mine or 
Tang’s. But it’s decidedly Ann 
Arbor. Welcome home.
Pacific Rim by Kana is located at 
114 W Liberty St.
