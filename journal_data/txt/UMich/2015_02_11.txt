During State of 
the City address, 

Duggan talks public 

safety, recovery 

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

In his second State of the City 

address, Detroit Mayor Mike 
Duggan praised his adminis-
tration both for improving the 
Detroit’s economic prospects 
and the city’s image regionally 
and nationwide.

Additionally, Duggan high-

lighted the importance of ensur-
ing Detroit’s longtime residents 
benefit from the city’s recovery.

“Can we build our recovery 

on the principle of economic 
inclusion?” he said. “What will 
the recovery of the city mean 
if the folks that have been here 
aren’t a part of it?”

Duggan delivered the address 

from 
the 
Redford 
Theatre, 

located in Detroit’s Brightmoor 
neighborhood. 
Residential 

blight hit the district particular-
ly hard and large swaths of land 
remain vacant.

Duggan noted the addition 

of 500 new jobs in Brightmoor 
with the opening of a new 
Meijer, and continued to dis-
cuss economic and community 
recovery throughout the rest of 
the address.

“This community is fighting 

back like so many others,” Dug-
gan said.

Duggan said his administra-

tion has worked to save houses 
from demolition through the 
Building Detroit website, which 
auctions city-owned homes to 
buyers who agree to fix and 
inhabit them within six months. 
The administration is also help-
ing sell vacant side lots to com-
munity members interested in 
maintaining properties adjacent 
to their own.

The mayor said property val-

ues are increasing in 25 Detroit 

‘U’ researchers 
argue quality of

Students aren’t the only ones 

receiving report cards.

Many hospitals earn grades, 

too. But according to a study 
by 
University 
researchers, 

surgical safety remains con-
stant across similar hospitals, 
whether or not the hospital 
received report cards.

The study’s authors consid-

ered the 263 hospitals evalu-
ated by the American College 
of Surgeons’ National Surgical 
Quality Improvement Program 
report card. The group found 
that the hospitals participating 
in the evaluation program not 
experience improvement over 
time compared to hospitals not 
receiving report cards.

Documents 

include autopsy 
report, statement 

from officer

By EMMA KERR

Daily News Editor

The Washtenaw Prosecu-

tor’s Office released several 
documents Monday related 

to the fatal shooting of Aura 
Rosser by an Ann Arbor police 
officer.

Following an investigation 

by the Michigan State Police, 
Prosecutor 
David 
Mackie 

determined last month that 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 
Officer 

David Ried’s shooting of Ross-
er, a 40-year-old Black woman 
from Ann Arbor, constituted 
lawful self defense.

The initial incident report 

said officers were dispatched 

to Rosser’s home following a 
911 call made by her ex-boy-
friend. When officers arrived, 
Rosser was holding a kitchen 
knife and was threatening 
officers with the knife and 
moving toward them. The 
knife appeared to be six to 
eight inches long, according to 
the report.

included the autopsy report, 
lab reports and crime scene

Over 27,000 
submit early, 
marking 17.4 
percent uptick

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

The upward trend continues.
The Office of Undergraduate 

Admissions received more than 
27,000 early action applications 
this year, according to Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald. 
The figure is up from nearly 
23,000 early action applications 
in 2014 — a 17.4 percent increase.

“Overall we expect admission 

applicants to increase again this 
year and this increase is the early 
sign of that overall increase,” 
Fitzgerald wrote in an e-mail to 
The Michigan Daily on Tuesday.

Between 2012 and 2013, early 

applications rose 15.8 percent 
from 19,000 to 22,000; between 
2013 and 2014, the number 
increased an additional 4.5 per-
cent from 22,000 to 23,000.

For 
the 
2014-2015 
school 

year, undergraduate enrollment 

increased slightly from the year 
prior, though the University had 
intended to curb the number of 
students enrolling for the Class 
of 2018.

During 
September’s 
Board 

of Regents meeting, University 
Provost Martha Pollack said the 
Office of Admissions plans to 
reduce the size of future classes, 
which could include shifting 
more early applicants to a wait-
list.

“We have been over-enrolling 

every year for the past five years 
and we have to stop this,” she 
said. “I’m not happy about it.”

Students deferred to regular 

admission were notified that 
their application remains under 
consideration in an e-mail from 
Erica Sanders, interim director 
of admissions.

“Our high application volume, 

coupled with the very strong 
credentials of our applicants in 
recent years, has contributed 
to an increasingly competitive 
admissions process,” the let-
ter reads. “As a result, we are 
writing to inform you that your 
application is currently being 
deferred for further review.”

Speaker touches 
on importance of 
“troublemaking” in 

achieving change

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

Activist Dr. Cheryl Clarke 

read poetry and facilitated 
discussion about the nation’s 

changing racial climate Tues-
day during the inaugural Wil-
liam Monroe Trotter Lecture.

Sponsored by the Trotter 

Multicultural 
Center 
along 

with a dozen other university 
units and departments, the lec-
ture took place in the Michigan 
League Ballroom and focused 
on the issues of racism, femi-
nism and lesbianism.

Anjali Anturkar, associate 

vice president for student life, 
delivered opening remarks at 

the event, noting the impor-
tance of a regularly scheduled 
diversity-oriented 
presenta-

tion.

“This 
inaugural 
William 

Trotter Lecture invites us to 
embrace the reality that each 
of us have multiple identities,” 
Anturkar said. “We are called 
on to create and sustain inclu-
sive space for everyone.”

Clarke, who was introduced 

as a Black lesbian femi-
nist, is the former dean of 

students at Rutgers University, 
where she received her mas-
ter’s and doctorate in English. 
Prior to her position as dean, 
she was the founding director 
of the Office of Diverse Com-
munity Affairs and Lesbian/
Gay Concerns at Rutgers.

Known for her poetry and 

activism, Clarke’s published 
books of poetry include “Nar-

SEXY SUPPLIES
STUDENT LIFE

In response to changing alcohol 

policies at peer institutions, Duke 
University administrators have 
stood by the school’s approach of 
barring student events from serv-
ing alcohol, The Duke Chronicle 
reported Monday.

Two weeks ago, Dartmouth 

College implemented a campus-
wide ban on hard liquor, follow-
ing a trend set by other schools 
including Bowdoin and Bates 
College. These policy changes 
reflect the goal of administrations 
to curtail dangerous behaviors on 
college campuses nationwide.

Duke students seem to agree 

with the administration’s choice 
to maintain the school’s current 
policy. When asked whether they 
believe harsher policies could 

be beneficial, many students 
expressed doubt.

“I don’t know how they would 

control that,” freshman Mirko 
Tancredi said in an interview with 
The Duke Chronicle. “I feel like if 
we were to do that it wouldn’t cut 
down consumption as much as we 
would like or think.”

UChicago shifts payroll

Beginning in the fall of 2015, 

University of Chicago students 
will be unable to simultaneous-
ly work as teaching assistants 
and lab assistants, The Chicago 
Maroon reported Thursday.

In January, the university 

moved from the UChicagoTime 
payroll system to a new system 

called WorkDay. By calculating 
student pay on an hourly basis 
rather than through lump sums, 
the new system has created a 
situation in which students hold-
ing both positions are exceeding 
the maximum number of allowed 
work hours.

According 
to 
UChicago 

spokesperson Jeremy Manier, 
“(The university) now (has) a 
more accurate picture of the 
overall magnitude of students’ 
work effort, and that information 
has compelled us to review how 
student work hours are estab-
lished and monitored to ensure 
they are in compliance with the 
limit on overall effort.”

CSG hears pitch for new 
fight song , ‘Hail and Unite’

Meeting also 

features training on 
addressing active 
shooter situations

BY LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

“The Victors” could soon have 

a modernistic younger sibling.

If a resolution presented to 

the Central Student Government 
Tuesday night passes, the body 
will provide funding to a group 
of students looking to develop an 
additional thematic song to play 
at University athletics games.

In 
addition 
to 
discussion 

of the resolution, the meeting 
also 
included 
an 
interactive 

presentation on reacting to an 
active shooter.

Business sophomore Adam 

Weiss, a representative on the 
CSG Assembly, spoke on behalf 
of the song campaign, which 
he called “Hail and Unite.” He 
said his friend, LSA senior Mike 
Weinberg, conceptualized the 
project.

“This project is meant to be, 

number one, extremely unique,” 
Weiss said. “The goal of this song 

is to get a lot of big names that are 
associated with the University.”

He added that the project 

would also be backed by a crowd-
funding campaign, which is 
tentatively set to launch next 
month.

The 
Hail 
and 
Unite 

organization 
asked 
CSG 

to allocate $2,750 from its 
Legislative Discretionary Fund 
to the project: $1,750 would go 
toward funding for a promotional 
video to recruit donations from 
students, 
and 
$1,000 
would 

go toward “speaker fees,” or 
accommodations for potential 
visiting contributors.

While the song’s lyrics and 

tune are still undetermined, 
Weiss said it is the organization’s 
aim to involve big names in the 
music business and University 
alumni to contribute to the song. 
For example, he said Weinberg 
wants to get Eminem involved.

Weiss also said that David 

Banner, a rapper and music 
producer, has already agreed to 
produce the final product.

Numerous 
representatives 

voiced uncertainty about the 
project because they felt its 
initial budgetary breakdown and 
ultimate goals were not clear 
enough to elicit funding. Others 
voiced concerns that it lacked the 

philanthropic value of student 
organizations that had received 
funding in the past, like MUSIC 
Matters or optiMize.

After it was suggested that 

a more detailed budget for 
the project be disclosed to the 
assembly, the resolution was 
sent to the finance committee for 
review.

The 
other 
important 

focus 
of 
Tuesday’s 
meeting 

was a presentation on active 
shooter 
situations, 
delivered 

by 
University 
Police 
Officer 

Matthew Butzky.

Butzky emphasized that in a 

situation where an active shooter 
is present, one has three options: 
run to a safe location, hide and 
attempt to barricade your space 
or fight to repel the threat.

“You’re not stuck in any one 

decision. This is fluid,” said 
Butzky about the three options. 
“If you can remove yourself from 
a dangerous situation, do it. Get 
out. It’s a simple solution, but 
people overlook it.”

Butzky delivered a similar 

presentation for the first time 
to a University undergraduate 
lecture last month. Previously, 
the Division of Public Safety 
and 
Security 
delivered 
the 

presentation upon request to 
campus units.

Program provides 
discounts at local 
businesses for not 
checking phone

BY NABEEL CHOLLAMPAT

Daily Staff Reporter

 If pricy college tuition was not 

incentive enough to pay attention 
in class, a new app is aiming to 
increase the stakes.

Pocket Points, a mobile appli-

cation developed by students at 
California State University, or 
Chico State, launched at the Uni-
versity last month. The app allows 
students to lock their phones dur-
ing class, and the amount of time 
locked corresponds to a number 
of points that redeemable for dis-
counts at local establishments.

The app was founded by Chico 

State students Rob Richardson 
and Mitch Gardner in the fall, and 
has now expanded to a number of 
schools across the country. The 

application uses location-based 
services to tell when a student is 
in class to prevent “cheating,” or 
looking at one’s phone.

LSA senior John Prickett, 

campus representative for Pocket 
Points, is a friend of the found-
ers. Though professors often state 
on their syllabi that points will 
be taken off for the using phones 
in class, he said those policies do 
little to deter students.

“In the majority of classrooms, 

there never seems to be a respect 
of the trust between the teacher 
and the kids,” Prickett said. “My 
parents pay a lot for me to come 
here, and for me to come to class 
and sit on my phone for an hour 
and a half, what am I really get-
ting out of that?”

According to Prickett, the 

application began at Chico State 
as a tool through which professors 
could award extra credit for good 
phone behavior. After failing to 
attract enough users, the founders 
discovered that offering discounts 
at local restaurants was much 
more effective as an incentive for 
students to use the application.

“It was sort of a pivotal moment 

for the app,” Prickett said. “They 
realized they weren’t getting the 
reaction they wanted to from the 
extra credit side, and who doesn’t 
like getting free discounts on food 
for paying attention in class?”

Prickett said Ann Arbor restau-

rants are currently on a trial peri-
od with the application, meaning 
it will be free for businesses to 
participate for the semester. The 
restaurants currently included 
are Pita Pit, The Brown Jug, The 
Blue Leprechaun, Comet Coffee, 
Get Some Burritos, Hunter House 
Hamburgers, Pita Kabob Grill, 
Pita Pit, Sottini’s Sub Shop and 
Tropical Smoothie Café.

Richardson and Gardner also 

recently added a feature that 
increases the rate of points accu-
mulated if more students are 
using the program, thus incen-
tivizing word-of-mouth between 
students.

Lesbian,” “Humid Pitch” and 
“Experimental 
Love.” 
Addi-

tionally, she was once a contrib-
utor to the editorial collective 
Conditions, a feminist literary 
journal.

Clarke 
has 
worked 
very 

closely with other Black femi-
nists and served on the board 
of New York Women Against 
Rape. In 2013, she earned the 
Kessler Award for outstand-
ing contributions to the field of 
LGBTQ studies.

During the lecture, Clarke 

emphasized 
the 
importance 

of 
being 
a 
“troublemaker,” 

encouraging others to speak out 
against injustice even if doing 
so is unpopular. In this vein, 
she 
acknowledged 
William 

Trotter — for whom the lecture 
series and the University’s mul-
ticultural center is named — as 
a Black, radical troublemaker 
of his time, adding that she was 

pleased to be the first of many 
speakers in the lecture series 
honoring his legacy.

Clarke also stressed the need 

to not merely solve the prob-
lems of race, classism, sexism 
and homophobia, but to create 
an open forum for discussing 
these issues.

“I would say that the Trot-

ter Center should be a space 
where it is indeed possible to 
act, speak, write and think,” 
she said.

To illustrate the need for 

creative thinking in the face 
of deep political issues, Clarke 
mentioned 
Audre 
Lorde, 
a 

Caribbean-American 
writer, 

feminist and lesbian, who she 
said was loyal to both poetry 
and feminism.

Clarke began her lecture 

by reading a poem that Lorde 
wrote, called “Sister, Morning 
Is a Time for Miracles.” Clarke 
said Lorde’s poetry attempts 
to facilitate ongoing dialogue 
about Black women and the 
injustice 
committed 
against 

them. She added that U.S. cul-
ture rejects Black culture no 
matter what Black people do to 
gain approval.

She isolated one of her favor-

ite 
Lorde-written 
passages 

to highlight the road to mak-
ing amends: “In order to come 
together, we must recognize 
each other,” she read, later 
reflecting that “this can take a 
strikingly contemporary view-
point.”

“Lorde uses blackness, femi-

nism and lesbianism to make 
her voice heard, and her voice 
to make blackness, feminism 
and lesbianism heard,” Clarke 
added.

Engineering 
freshman 

Suzy Haupt said the perspec-
tives 
Clarke 
brought 
forth 

were unique and subsequently

“We come here to get a schol-

arly education,” she said. “But

spectives and grow culturally.”

The study’s lead author, 

Nicholas Osborne, a vascular 
surgeon at the University of 
Michigan Health System’s Car-
diovascular Center, said he was 
interested in finding whether 
or not there was a benefit to 
participating in a program such 
as ACS-NSQIP.

“What you can take from the 

study is that hospital quality 
has gone up across the board 
during the time period that we 
looked at,” Osborne said. “All 
hospitals improved but that 
improvement wasn’t more so in 
hospitals that are in NSQIP.”

NSQIP was developed by the 

Department of Veterans Affairs 
during the 1990s to evaluate 
surgical practice in VA hospi-
tals. Private hospitals even-
tually expressed interest in 
adopting the program, which in 
1999 was piloted at several pri-
vate institutions, including the 
University.

The study’s authors said the 

lack of relative improvement 
could be due to the failure of 
institution’s to use the report 
cards to change surgical pro-
cedures.

“This is a good example of 

why we need to look at the 
data,” Osborne said. “I think 
the future of quality improve-
ment will be affected by this 
study because it encourages 
hospitals to participate in not 
only a data report, but to par-
ticipate in a quality collabora-
tive.”

Public hospitals in the state 

of Michigan previously partici-
pated in both ACS-NSQIP and 
a regional collaborative called 
the Michigan Surgical Qual-
ity Collaborative. In 2012, the 
state pulled out of ACS-NSQIP, 
and hospitals its hospitals now 
only participate in MSQC.

Unlike ACS-NSQIP, MSQC 

brings together surgeons to 
analyze the report cards and 
brainstorm 
strategies 
for 

improving hospital care.

Justin Dimick, chief of the 

UMHS division of minimally 
invasive surgery and senior 
author of the study, said the 
MSQC allows Michigan hospi-
tals to excel beyond those using 
ACS-NSQIP, making it one of 
the safest states to have sur-
gery.

“Michigan does a really 

nice job at analysis and issu-
ing report cards,” Dimick said. 
“Without a tutor, or lesson 
plan, you can’t get improve-
ment. Michigan does things 
differently through a collab-
oratively quality improvement 
program, where we do measure 
outcomes. We then build on 
top of that a structure where 
the surgeons meet four times 
a year to help implement them 
locally.”

Andrew 
Ryan, 
associate 

professor in the School of Pub-
lic Health and co-author of 
the study, said designing and 
implementing interventions is 
most important in the process 
of improving surgical quality. 
He added that this study can 
motivate hospitals to actually 
implement measures based on 
their report cards.

“The fact that it didn’t 

achieve its objective means to 
me that we need to keep search-
ing and come up with new 
ways to measure important 
patient outcomes,” Ryan said. 
“We can’t be complacent about 
thinking that we’ve solved our 
quality problems, and that we 
have the answers. We have 
seen decline in adverse events, 
so improvement is happen-
ing, but the question is how 
do we design and implement 
interventions that are going to 
improve quality of care?”

reports, Ried provided a state-
ment describing the events on 
the night of the shooting.

“Rosser had the knife in her 

right hand had the blade now 
facing us, it was up in a ready to 
strike position with her elbow 
bent and arm raised with the 
blade about level with her jaw-
line,” Ried said.

After Reid said he ordered 

Rosser several times to put 
down her knife, she proceeded 
to move toward the officers, the 
original incident report said.

“Rosser was still ignoring 

my commands drop the knife. 
I feared my life and the life of 
Officer Raab. I believed we were 
in imminent danger. I was in 
fear for the safety for myself and 
Officer Raab, so I discharged my 
firearm one time (to) stop the 
threat.”

According to the other officer 

present at the scene, Mark Raab, 
Rosser’s eyes were widened and 
she appeared “deranged.” He 
fired his Taser at Rosser, and 
said this occurred at around the 
same time as Ried shot his fire-
arm.

“This officer yelled stop and 

fired the Taser at Rosser, fear-

ing for officer safety. Officer 
Ried fired his side arm at nearly 
the same time,” Raab said. “The 
time from when officers first 
entered the house and yelled 
police to when she was shot and 
Tasered was approximately 5-10 
seconds.”

Toxicology analysis revealed 

a blood alcohol concentration 
0.170 grams /100 mL along with 
cocaine and THC. In Michigan, 
it is illegal to drive with a BAC 
of .08 grams /100 mL or higher. 
Cocaine residue was found in 
Rosser’s bedroom, along with a 
hand-rolled cigarette that was 
suspected to have contained 
marijuana.

The 
Controlled 
Substance 

Report said there were 0.073 
grams of marijuana found.

The autopsy report, conduct-

ed at the University of Michigan 
Morgue, showed Rosser died 
from a gunshot wound to the 
chest.

Rosser was reportedly shot 

with a Taser and a 40-caliber 
semi-automatic handgun.

The autopsy report revealed 

a penetrating entrance gunshot 
wound to the left chest with 
perforation of the heart, proxi-
mal aorta and esophagus.

According to the autopsy 

report, Rosser had a history of 
bipolar disease.

There were two other inci-

dents in which police were 
called that involved Rosser, one 
in September and another in 
October. Officers reported these 
instances as assault/simple bat-
tery, according to the Incident 
Reports released along with the 
documents relating to Rosser’s 
death.

In January, demonstrators 

marched through Ann Arbor to 
protest the prosecutor’s deci-
sion not to press charges in the 
incident. The event followed a 
series of demonstrations in Ann 
Arbor and nationwide protest-
ing the use of unnecessary force 
by law enforcement officials.

At the protest, Rosser’s sister, 

Shae Ward, expressed disagree-
ment with the prosecutor’s 
decision.

“My hope is that I can get 

strong enough to speak for her,” 
Ward said. “Because I know 
her person. She would have 
never attacked Officer Ried. She 
would have never made him feel 
that he would have to take her 
life to defuse the situation. That 
is just outlandish. It totally is 
outlandish.”

neighborhoods.

The city is also working to 

demolish hundreds of blighted 
homes deemed unsuitable for 
habitation.

The mayor also touted his 

program that gives loans to city 
residents for repairing blighted 
homes. The plan, backed by city 
council and the federal govern-
ment, has a loan pool worth $8 
million and has zero percent 
interest for lower to middle 
income residents.

The audience gave the mayor 

a standing ovation during his 

announcement that the city will 
finish the year with a balanced 
budget for the first time since 
2002.

As job creation in the city 

improves, Duggan said he wants 
to ensure Detroit’s residents are 
offered the new jobs. To this 
end, he stressed job creation 
and training for residents of the 
city, listing the uptick in city 
residents having jobs in skilled 
trade fields like plumbing and 
electric. He also demanded that 
new development projects, such 
as the forthcoming arena for 
the Detroit Red Wings and a 
new accompanying entertain-
ment district, create jobs for 
Detroiters.

“I believe one thing in my 

heart, that talent in this world 
is distributed equally, no mat-
ter what community, no matter 
where you are,” Duggan said. 
“What isn’t distributed equally 
is opportunity.”

The mayor also spoke on 

improved neighborhood service 
and safety, including Duggan 
a plan to secure body cameras 
for police officers and put 200 
more officers in the streets.

Many other cities across the 

nation have adopted body cam-
eras on police officers to hold 
officers accountable for brutali-
ty against citizens, an issue that 
has sparked protest nationwide.

“We are going to change the 

culture of this community to 
recognize every life matters,” 
he said.

The mayor also touched on 

the fact that police response 
times have been cut 20 minutes 
in the last year and a half, from 
37 minutes to 17. Furthermore, 
in the last year, the city’s emer-
gency medical service response 
time, formerly the slowest in 
the country, has been cut seven 
minutes and there are twice as 
many ambulances on the road.

Duggan 
also 
stressed 

revamping the city’s transit, 
jokingly calling the city’s high 
car insurance rates its “biggest 
problem.”

“I’m going to work every sin-

gle day until we fix this injus-
tice and get people a fairer rate 
on their insurance,” he said.

Along with improving car 

insurance, the mayor spoke on 
ameliorating the city’s pub-
lic transit system. He said 
the administration has hired 
more drivers and implemented 
a smartphone application to 
track the bus schedule, and has 
since worked with Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden to purchase 80 
more buses in the city, eleven of 
which will beginning running 
this week.

“For the first time in years, 

riders are coming back to the 
(Detroit Department of Trans-
portation) system,” he said.

Some Alabama 
counties refuse 
gay marriages

Same-sex 
marriage 
spread 

further across Alabama on Tues-
day as more courthouses issued 
licenses to gays and lesbians, yet 
some counties still defied a federal 
judge’s order, so couples took their 
fight back to court.

The dispute and confusion 

headed toward a showdown in 
federal court set for Thursday in 
Mobile, where gay couples have 
waited for two days in a court-
house after officials quit issuing 
marriage licenses altogether — 
even for heterosexual couples — 
rather than sell them to same-sex 
couples.

Jim Strawser and his partner 

John Humphrey sat outside the

dow at the Mobile County court-

“Come on, you’ve got a fed-

eral court order. Open those win-
dows,” Strawser said to no avail.

Alabama Chief Justice Roy 

Moore threw the state into dis-
array when, at the 11th hour, he 
ordered probate judges not to

30 abducted in 
Cameroon and

Nigeria’s Boko Haram Islamic 

extremists have abducted about 30 
people including eight Cameroo-

in two bus hijackings in Cameroon 
and Nigeria, Cameroon residents and 
a Nigerian intelligence officer said 
Tuesday.

Boko Haram, who kidnapped 

nearly 300 schoolgirls in Nigeria last 
year in an incident that ignited inter-
national outrage, have taken eight 
Cameroonian girls hostage, said 
Chetima Ahmidou, the principal of a 
school in the area. The girls range in 
age from 11 to 14 and come from the 
town of Koza, he said.

The bus attack took place Sunday 

about 11 miles (18 kilometers) from 
Cameroon’s border with Nigeria. 
Seven other hostages were slain and 
their bodies scattered near the bor-
der, said Ahmidou, whose brother 
was the bus driver and was among 
those killed.

Provision in 

state constitution 
could prevent full 

use of funds 

DENVER (AP) — Colorado fi-

nally learned Tuesday how much 
tax revenue it collected from rec-
reational marijuana in the first 
year of sales, and the haul was 
below estimates — about $44 mil-
lion.

The release of December sales 

taxes gave Colorado its first full 
calendar year of the taxes from 
recreational pot sales, which be-
gan Jan. 1, 2014.

Colorado was the first govern-

ment anywhere in the world to 
regulate marijuana production 
and sale, so other governments are 

watching closely. In Washington, 
where legal pot sales began in July, 
the state had hauled in about $16.4 
million in marijuana excise taxes 
by the end of the year; through No-
vember, it brought in an additional 
$6.3 million in state and local sales 
and business taxes.

Colorado’s total haul from 

marijuana for 2014 was about $76 
million. That includes fees on the 
industry, plus pre-existing sales 
taxes on medical marijuana prod-
ucts. The $44 million represents 
only new taxes on recreational 
pot.

Those new taxes were initially 

forecast to bring in about $70 mil-
lion.

“Everyone who thinks Colora-

do’s rollin’ in the dough because of 
marijuana? That’s not true,” said 
state Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver 
Democrat and one of the Legisla-
ture’s main budget-writers.

By all accounts, the $70 million 

estimate was a guess. And Colo-
rado has already adjusted down-
ward spending of the taxes, on 
everything from substance-abuse 
treatment to additional training 
for police officers.

Still, Colorado will likely have 

to return to voters to ask to keep 
the pot tax money. That’s be-
cause of a 1992 amendment to 
the state constitution that re-
stricts 
government 
spending. 

The amendment requires new 
voter-approved taxes, such as 
the pot taxes, to be refunded if 
overall state tax collections rise 
faster than permitted.

Lawmakers from both parties 

are expected to vote this spring 
on a proposed ballot measure 
asking Coloradans to let the state 
keep pot taxes.

Colorado’s tax results under-

score a big conflict facing public 

officials considering marijuana 
legalization.

Taxes should be kept low if 

the goal is to eliminate pot’s 
black market. But the allure of a 
potential weed windfall is a pow-
erful argument for voters, most 
of whom don’t use pot.

“Being able to claim some 

non-trivial tax revenue is im-
portant to the legalization move-
ment,” said Jeffrey Miron, a Har-
vard University economist who 
follows national drug policy.

So far, Colorado’s trail-blazing 

marijuana experiment shows the 
tax revenue isn’t trivial.

But Colorado has also shown 

that pot-smokers don’t necessar-
ily line up to leave the tax-free 
black market and pay hefty tax-
es. If medical pot is untaxed, or 
if pot can be grown at home and 
given away as in Colorado, the 
black market persists.

I 

don’t “do” numbers. As an 
English major, I was drawn 
to an interpretative world of 

innumerable pos-
sibilities. 
Noth-

ing is concrete. 
Nothing is finite. 
Each word, each 
phrase, 
each 

image 
possesses 

a myriad of mean-
ings. The most 
appealing aspect 
of all, though, was 
the field’s lack of 
numbers.

Yet, 
during 
some 
impromp-

tu weekend research, I actively 
searched for numbers.

Cotton swabs amassed on the 

counter as I swabbed away rem-
nants of the previous night’s make-
up. As eyeliner smudges darkened 
the ashen smears encircling my 
eyes, I began to question why I even 
bothered with the time-consum-
ing process. The answer: to add a 
few years to my “baby face.” One 
inquiry led to another, and I began 
to measure the amount of time the 
process actually took. The answer: 
seven minutes. Seven minutes to 
artificially add maybe two years to 
a face I believe looks perpetually 16 
years old.

Inspired by this discovery, I 

began to tabulate a list of numbers:

Five feet with the addition of two 

inches to comprise my height.

A “9” found stitched onto the tag 

of my jeans.

A dilapidated “7” faded by con-

stant friction between sock fabric 
and shoe soles.

The length of my hair.
The quantity of pimples dotting 

the rim of my chin.

The inches circulating my rib-

cage representing my bra’s band 
size.

My weight.
My body mass index.
The numbers added together, in 

theory, could provide an unusual 
and faulty approximation of my 
physical appearance.

My miniscule data collection 

directed my thoughts toward the 
subject I was intending to research 

for my next column, and I began to 
consider more measurements. My 
mind flashed to the tiny, glowing 
green rectangles connecting into 
formation on a treadmill panel to 
enumerate the distance an indi-
vidual runs or the calories they’ve 
burnt. That same person could tally 
the amount of weight they’ve lifted 
or the total hours they’ve spend 
working out daily. Another person 
might calculate the amount of calo-
ries they’ve consumed.

One 
might 
enumerate 
the 

instances when they’ve walked past 
a mirror only to be disheartened by 
the figure reflected back at them. 
Another may reflect on the quantity 
of times they’ve received disparag-
ing comments about their appear-
ance from others — or even from 
themselves. Conversely, one could 
tally the number of times someone 
draws attention to their body in a 
positive 
way, 

whether 
it’s 

desired or not. 
An 
individual 

who 
religious-

ly 
maintains 

a 
strict 
diet 

may 
recount 

the number of 
times 
friends 

mockingly com-
mented on their 
decision to eat 
a bit of “junk food.” For a sizeable 
population of individuals, their 
measurements may even include the 
number of meals they’ve skipped, a 
calculation of the instances when 
they’ve purged or the number of 
times they’ve binged in a week.

As a society, we fixate on these 

measurements. We try to modify 
them. We stress about them. We 
use them as motivation. As a result, 
these sums can often masquerade 
as markers of individual worth and 
can acquire enough power to demol-
ish our self-esteem. Our own indi-
vidualized assortment of numbers 
infiltrates our thoughts and daily 
lives to shape the ways we view the 
bodies we inhabit. According to a 
study cited by a Brown University 
webpage on body image and health, 
“74.4% of normal-weight women 

stated that they thought about their 
weight or appearance ‘all the time’ 
or ‘frequently.’ ” 46 percent of nor-
mal-weight men responded in a sim-
ilar manner to the question.

While members of our society 

— myself included — may be in an 
ongoing battle with our own set of 
measurements, there are far more 
important figures requiring our 
attention. One-fourth of the nation-
al college student population — as 
reported by the National Institute 
of Mental Health — is afflicted by 
an eating disorder. A separate study 
found that “95% of individuals who 
have an eating disorder are between 
the ages of 12 and 25.8.” According 
to the National Eating Disorder 
Association, on the national scale, 
roughly 20 million women and 10 
million men experience an eating 
disorder of clinical significance 
within their lifetime.

Numbers 

inform us, pro-
vide 
logical 

solutions 
and 

simplify 
our 

world. 
How-

ever, our per-
ceptions toward 
and 
apprecia-

tion for the vast 
array of body 
types that exist 
should not be 

quantified. The human body, with 
its wide-encompassing variations, 
is a qualitative entity, incapable of 
standardization. Our fervent desire 
to align our bodies to match a set 
of idealized measurements only 
exacerbates these highly prevalent 
and detrimental mental illnesses. 
Even numbers are incapable of 
expressing the entire significance 
and impact eating disorders have 
on our society. To truly understand 
and raise awareness about eating 
disorders, society needs more than 
statistics. We need to understand 
the misconceptions, the stigmati-
zation and the contributing factors 
— information I hope to cover in an 
upcoming column.

O

n Wednesday, Jan. 7, 
terrorists attacked the 
headquarters of Charlie 

Hebdo, a French 
satirical 
maga-

zine. These ter-
rorists 
were 

angered by the 
disrespectful 
cartoons of the 
Prophet Muham-
mad 
(pbuh)* 

published by the 
magazine. 
This 

resulted 
in 
a 

global debate on 
free speech, with 
people tweeting and protesting in 
support of the magazine behind the 
banner “Je Suis Charlie,” which is 
French for “I am Charlie.”

Is 
the 
claim 
#JeSuisCharlie 

really what people should be 
advocating for?

On social media, some people took 

a different approach to the issue by 
using other slogans like #Respect-
forMuslims, and #IamNotCharlie, 
demonstrating other views as people 
began to question identifying with 
Charlie. Additionally, people tweet-
ed with the hashtag #JeSuisAhmed 
in honor of the Muslim police offi-
cer who died protecting the Char-
lie Hebdo building. These hashtags 
advocated making the distinction 
between Muslims and extremists, 
recognizing that Muslims were also 
hurt in this controversy.

I will start by making it clear 

that I condemn the attack on Char-
lie Hebdo, although I will not take 
responsibility for the actions of 
these terrorists, as they do not act on 
the principles of Islam.

As a Muslim, seeing that people 

are so fast to claim “I am Charlie” 
in defense of these cartoons of my 
beloved Prophet (pbuh) is frustrat-
ing. If I am true to the practices of 
my Prophet (pbuh), I only recall the 
story of how he visited his neighbor 
while she was ill even though she 
spent her days cursing him openly. 
All of the stories of the Prophet 

(pbuh) that I know stressed his 
kindness and compassion for oth-
ers. Terrorists that claim killing 
staff members of Charlie Hebdo is 
in some way defending the honor of 
Islam do not have the slightest idea 
of what it means to be Muslim.

To claim “I am Charlie” is to 

identify with Charlie and oversim-
plify the situation instead of real-
izing the complexities of the thin 
line between freedom of speech and 
hateful speech. I see the double stan-
dards so heavily ingrained in the 
words “I am Charlie” as people point 
fingers at Muslims for being too sen-
sitive and backward to appreciate a 
harmless satire. This so commonly 
painted picture of Muslims only 
adds to Islamophobia and the idea of 
a “Muslim other.”

As an American-born Muslim, I 

see this strong sense of Orientalism 
as a tale of the Muslim who cried 
blasphemy. In this tale, the simplis-
tic Muslim cannot understand the 
beloved Western freedom of speech. 
Saying Charlie is the banner behind 
which freedom of speech should be 
upheld is largely 
a result of these 
ideas and not 
consistent with 
how 
Western 

onlookers usu-
ally see this type 
of expression.

Perceiving 

Charlie 
Heb-

do’s 
cartoons 

similarly 
to 

anti-Semitic 
or 

racist depictions will help to combat 
Islamophobia. The magazine claims 
that the satire targets extremists, 
not Muslims. I would question what 
they view as hateful speech against 
moderate Muslims, as it’s the Proph-
et (pbuh) who is depicted, and he is a 
figure revered by all Muslims. 

Charlie Hebdo stands as an insti-

tution that promotes the double 
standard of normalizing Islamo-
phobia. In 2008, Affaire Siné drew 
a cartoon for Charlie Hebdo that 

was accused of being anti-Semitic. 
He was eventually fired by Charlie 
Hebdo editor Philippe Val. As Val 
stated, Sine’s cartoon and statements 
“could be interpreted as making a 
link between conversion to Judaism 
and social success.” Anti-Semitism 
calls for an apology, but promoting 
Islamophobia is freedom of speech.

To say “I am Charlie” creates the 

claim that in order for a society to 
truly have freedom of expression, 
even the most hateful speech must 
not only be tolerated, but also cel-
ebrated. Looking back, it seems, 
that the only way to truly progress 
is to move away from this double 
standard, and see Charlie Hebdo 
for what it is.

The perceptions of the car-

toons published by Charlie Hebdo 
should be at the same level as any 
other stereotypical publication. It 
should be viewed on the same level 
as the anti-Semitic depictions of 
Jews throughout their history or 
blackface before the civil rights 
movement. These cartoons are pro-
paganda and the acceptance of them 

as 
harmless 

acts 
of 
free-

dom of expres-
sion is ignoring 
the 
fact 
that, 

throughout his-
tory, 
progress 

away from hate-
ful stereotypes 
comes 
with 

viewing 
these 

depictions 
as 

hateful speech. 

Whether or not people believe that 
the cartoons should still be allowed 
to be published, we can only move 
forward as a society by realizing 
the double standards ingrained in 
claiming “I am Charlie”.

I am a Muslim; I am not an extrem-

ist. I am progress; I am not Charlie.

*pbuh stands for “peace be upon 

him.”

Martian metropolis

Of all the bodies in our solar system, none 

has so captured the imagination like Mars, the 
red planet. Perhaps it’s the striking crimson of 
the iron oxide, and its connotations of the blood 
and fury of war — the planet was named after 
that particular Roman god, in fact. But perhaps 
it’s because Mars is relevant; never before in 
human history have we felt so close to anoth-
er extraterrestrial body. Now, as we steadily 
populate that planet with all manner of elec-
tromechanical rovers and robots, write books, 
run simulations and dream of a life on another 
world, we bring ourselves within reach of that 
astounding possibility.

Mars, let it be said, is strictly uninhabit-

able by our limited standards. It’s on average 
50 percent farther from the sun than we are, 
and its temperatures drop to frigid extremes. 
A Martian winter, for instance, commonly 
drops to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit below 
zero. Dust flung into the atmosphere by the 
wind stays there for extended periods, cre-
ating massive, blinding dust storms that pre-
vent sunlight from warming the planet. These 
effects combine to produce a world whose 
weather is as inscrutable and hostile as the 
god for which it is named.

Of course, that hasn’t stopped humans from 

attempting to peek behind the curtain. It’s a 
remarkable thing: Mars is the only known plan-
et inhabited solely by robots. While we have 
had successful landers on Venus, they have only 
been ‘alive’ for minutes before instrument fail-
ure. The gas giants don’t have a surface to land 
upon. And a landing has never been achieved on 
Mercury or Pluto. From the failed Mars 2, 3 and 
6 landers from the USSR to the recent tweets 
of the United States’ Curiosity rover, Mars has 
been invaded at least 13 times.

The landers did some great work there. 

Phoenix, for example, started an intense debate 
about the existence of metastable liquid water 
(what we would call a brine) in several regions 
of Mars. However, the rovers gave Mars explo-
ration real heart. The first was the Sojourner, 
then the Spirit, then the Opportunity and final-
ly the Curiosity in 2011.

Curiosity is the real champion — right after 

the rover landed, the probe found some exciting 

evidences showing that approximately 3.5 bil-
lion years ago, a lake existed in the crater that 
she landed in (yes, Curiosity is a she). But who 
really cares? I mean, geologists and planetary 
scientists care; they want to understand what 
happened. But why should society care?

We explore Mars because of its similarity 

to our own planet. In fact, it is suspected that 
at one point Mars resembled Earth in many 
ways - so what happened? Even more fright-
eningly, could it happen to us? To answer 
these questions, it is clear that visiting Mars 
is the next step.

Nowadays, however, we do things with a 

more 21st-century approach. SpaceX recently 
partnered with Google on a project to send 
up thousands of miniature satellites in low 
earth orbit to provide low cost Internet to the 
entire planet. Elon Musk, the ambitious CEO 
of SpaceX, says that this project will help fund 
what will ultimately become the first city on 
Mars. But Martian Metropolis aside, we first 
need to get there.

Sure, NASA and a dozen other potential 

space-farers are working on it, but support is 
the most vital component in any project. Enthu-
siasm and — most of all — a sincere belief in our 
ability to soar are two of the most important 
aspects in space exploration. That’s where we 
the people, scientist or nonscientist, blue-collar 
or white, need to step up. Through community-
driven organizations like SEDS, the Planetary 
Society or even Pinterest, Kickstarter and 
Twitter, anyone can express their belief in an 
interplanetary species, and in the power of the 
human drive.

Ad Astra.

ing awareness and enthusiasm about the devel-
opments in the space science and industries. We

As students at the University of Michigan, 

we are lucky enough to be surrounded by peo-
ple who are passionate about the recognition 
and equality of all social identities, and we are 
encouraged to become involved in activism 
around social justice issues. Yet one issue con-
tinues to be overlooked, even by employees and 
administration at the University — people who 
should care more about the discrimination that 
impacts many of their students on a regular 
basis.

Due to the existing inequality in the blood 

donation process, it’s necessary to spread 
awareness about the FDA’s policy that bans men 
who have sex with men (MSM) from donating 
blood, while simultaneously advocating for a 
policy change. This will require the support of 
the University campus, the Ann Arbor commu-
nity and beyond.

According to a meeting that occurred with 

the Blood Products Advisory Committee of 
the Food and Drug Administration on Dec. 2, 
blood donation is “not considered a civil right.” 
This was one of several infuriating comments 
expressed by those hesitating to change the 
policy. Though recent conversations have been 
shaped around changing the policy to a one-
year deferral period, the hesitations toward 
moving forward with a policy change are still 
incredibly discriminatory. Even a one-year 
deferral period implies that simply being gay or 
bisexual is a risk.

A study at the University of California, Los 

Angeles determined that this recent change 
could allow over 317,000 more blood dona-
tions each year, but a removal of this policy 
could allow that number to double. Considering 
that each blood donation can save three lives, 
a removal of the policy could potentially save 
thousands of lives every year.

Despite the excitement surrounding the 

only progress regarding a change in this policy 
since its implementation in 1983, many fac-
tors are being overlooked. Individuals would 
still be discriminated against based on their 
sexual orientation, and those who identify as 
MSM are being forced to remain abstinent for 
12 months if they wish to donate blood. Behav-
iorally based deferral periods related to con-
tracting HIV, such as intravenous drug use or 
receiving payment for sex, are one-year defer-
rals. Although this new deferral period for 
MSM claims to be following the same guide-
lines, it focuses on sexual orientation rather 
than risky sexual behaviors for all potential 

donors. However, with new nucleic acid scien-
tific testing, HIV can be detected within three 
days of contracting the virus, and every blood 
donation is already tested for HIV. Therefore, 
even a one-year deferral period is unwarrant-
ed, and the concern should be refocused away 
from sexual orientation.

A successful and appropriate policy change 

would be to ask all potential donors about 
potentially unsafe sexual behaviors, such as 
having new sexual partners or unprotected sex. 
It’s entirely possible that people who are cur-
rently eligible to donate by the FDA’s standards 
are at a much greater risk of contracting HIV 
than those who identify as MSM, which is why 
an overhaul of the entire blood donation health 
history process is necessary. This would create 
a blood supply that’s even safer than it is now, 
while simultaneously removing sexual orienta-
tion from the questioning process.

This Wednesday, from 2 to 8 p.m. in the 

Pendleton Room of the Michigan Union, Blood 
Drives United is hosting a sponsor blood drive. 
The aim of this blood drive is to create an 
inclusive space, raise awareness and educate 
the community. Anyone who’s ineligible to 
donate because of this discriminatory policy is 
encouraged to bring someone to donate on their 
behalf, which will demonstrate that potentially 
twice as much blood could be collected if this 
policy were lifted.

We will be engaging in conversations to 

address opinions about the policy, how we can 
better educate those on campus and ways to 
bring this activism to the attention of the FDA 
to push for a more inclusive policy change. 
Those who attend will receive a free t-shirt, 
have the opportunity to be interviewed for a 
video explaining the policy and will be able to 
engage in meaningful dialogue about social 
justice in blood donation and healthcare.

It’s imperative to consider how this policy is 

still encouraging discrimination in the United 
States. Several countries do not factor sexual 
orientation into their blood donation processes, 
including Chile, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Poland, 
Portugal, Russia and South Africa. It’s time that 
the United States learns from other countries to 
see how ending this inequality could also save 
more lives.

If you have any questions or ideas about the 

policy or Blood Drives United’s efforts, please 
contact blooddrivesunited@umich.edu.

‘Honeybear’ is 
candid and lovely

Father John Misty 
becomes a romantic 

on latest album

By BRIAN BURLAGE

Daily Arts Writer

For most of the 18th century, 

men like Father John Misty 
were referred to as libertines. 
Their aim was 
pleasure, 
their 

creed was self-
satisfaction. 
They 
weren’t 

immoral 
so 

much 
as 
they 

were 
amoral. 

Society’s 
rules 

and 
standards 

weren’t flawed, 
necessarily, 
but they were just inadequate, 
inaccurate and irrelevant. Much 
of their daily routines consisted 
of 
elaborate 
and 
self-aware 

schemes 
for 
attention, 
and 

anything done during the day 
was done in the joy of leisure. 
Men like Father John Misty 
lived in whimsy. They lived 
in the world they created for 
themselves.

It’s important to consider I 

Love You, Honeybear within this 
context because until now, for 
Father John Misty, the concept 
of sex has been easy. The concept 
of love, on the other hand, has 
not. Love in this framework is 
like that elusive but fearsome 
luxury, 
the 
awe-inspiring 

aura that lurks behind scented 
candles, French bottles of wine 
and Egyptian cotton bed sheets. 
In Father John Misty’s eyes, the 
mystery in any relationship isn’t 
a question of sex or harbored 
secrets, but of how two people – 
any two people – can create this 
thing called love between them.

Misty (a.k.a. Josh Tillman) 

has called I Love You, Honeybear 
a concept album, inspired by 

the experience of his marriage 
to 
his 
long-time 
girlfriend, 

Emma, who is a photographer. 
The essential “concept” of the 
album is that it tries to recreate 
the confusions as he felt himself 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 

exposed – a sort of gradual turn 
of soul. He found his own world 
invaded and usurped by the 
world of a wonderful woman. 
For the first time in his life, he 
could feel his schemes, tricks 
and self-defenses dissolve into 
something like real affection. 
The 
true 
shock 
occurred 

when he realized that he was 
strangely comfortable with all 
of this.

The 
album’s 
enormous 

sound is, in part, a response 
to the disorientation we feel 
when we must surrender our 
own defenses to someone we 
care about but hardly know. 
On I Love You, Honeybear, 
Misty 
constructs 
cathedrals 

to give his emotions enough 

space to reverberate and then 
conclusively 
condense. 
The 

album’s landscape is vast and 
expansive, but it’s also filled 
with intricacies and subplots. 
Take these 11 songs together 
and there’s a collected sense 
that Father John Misty reaches 
and expands out into the open 
plains of love – in the hope of 
finding some small truth to take 
back with him to share with 
Emma.

And he does. He does this 

a thousand times over. This 
is Tillman the monogamous 
lover, the loyal husband, the sex 
symbol in hiding, baring his soul 
to his new wife, listing all the 
things he barely understands 
about their union. His anxiety 
is evident from the outset, as he 
sings in the opener, “My love, 
you’re the one I want to watch 
the ship go down with / The 
future can’t be real, I barely 
know how long a moment is.” 
And, for a moment, this sounds 
like an earnest confession. Then, 
Misty qualifies it with, “Unless 
we’re naked, getting high on 
the mattress.” In fact, many of 
the album’s sincerest moments 
are delivered within these little 
quips and witticisms. They’re 
fun and intelligent. He writes 
them in so often and under 

every 
circumstance, 
which 

proves his great devotion to this 
budding love. While the humor 
might sound affronting at first, 
we come to understand that it’s 
just his way of being himself.

Aside from the soul-filled 

philosophical aspects of the 
album, it is, in its sound alone, 
a folk-pop masterpiece. These 
songs could exist as any one 
of a dozen Elton John B-sides 
or 
Randy 
Newman 
bootleg 

cuts. Misty pulls the melodies 
straight from ’70s psychedelic 
rock and adds to them the emo-
tional gusto of modern folk 
and indie, making them sturdy, 
replete with warmth. The rich-
est part, perhaps, of I Love You, 
Honeybear is that it sounds like 
a complete album. “Chateau 
Lobby #4 (in C for Two Vir-
gins)” touches on the southern 
influence, while “True Affec-
tion” graces electronic. “When 
You’re Smiling and Astride Me” 
bears soul, “Strange Encoun-
ter” addresses prog rock and 
“The Ideal Husband” achieves 
classic rock.

The 
album’s 
emotion 

culminates with the last three 
tracks, 
each 
reminiscent 

of 
a 
distinct 
Beatles-esque 

temperament. 
“Holy 
Shit” 

is teeming with historic and 

cultural 
allusion 
as 
Misty 

wonders what it all has to do 
with him. In his reasoning, 
Misty stops and ponders when 
he reaches the idea of love. 
“Maybe love is just an economy 
based on resource scarcity,” he 
belts uncertainty along with 
several other questions. Then, 
however, he offers the song’s 
first assured statement, the one 
thing he knows for sure: “But 
our fantasy is what that’s gotta 
do with you and me.”

While “I Went to the Store 

One Day” quietly capitalizes on 
this sentiment, “Bored in the 
USA” predicts it. Indeed, “Bored” 
supersedes the whole album as 
a reflection on what it means 
to love in modern American 
society. Set to a soft piano 
melody and backed by a chorus 
of strings, Misty reveals how 
far he’s come in his time with 
Emma. “Now, I’ve got a lifetime 
to consider all the ways / I’ve 
grown more disappointing to you 
/ As my beauty warps and fades 
/ I suspect you feel the same,” 
he sings. Suddenly, the album 
clicks. In light of his marriage, 
his emotional confusion and 
thoughts about love, a clear idea 
takes shape. Father John Misty 
has 
become, 
hopelessly 
and 

unwittingly, a romantic.

TV REVIEW
‘Saul’ needs to break 
out of ‘Bad’ ’s shadow

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

“Better Call Saul” is no “Break-

ing Bad.”

Ever since the acclaimed meth 

tragedy 
aired 

its 
brilliant 

finale one year, 
four 
months 

and 13 days ago 
(not 
that 
I’m 

counting), 
a 

Jesse Pinkman-
shaped hole has 
remained 
in 

TV’s collective 
heart. No other 
series 
could 

ever thrill in quite the same way 
as “Breaking Bad.” Nothing can 
ever strike all the same nerves and 
leave viewers breathless and curs-
ing Vince Gilligan’s name when 
the end title card flashes across the 
screen. But “Breaking Bad” is over, 
and “Better Call Saul” has risen to 
Heisenberg’s money throne. To be 
successful, “Saul” needed to assert 
its independence with a series pre-
miere that leaves all comparisons 
in the Albuquerque dust.

“Better 
Call 
Saul” 
follows 

“Breaking 
Bad” 
fan-favorite 

Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk, 
“Nebraska”) back in 2002, when 
his name was Jimmy McGill 
and his characteristic bravura 
and grandiose confidence didn’t 
extend past the courtroom. Jimmy 
is introduced as an unglamorous 
public defender, the very antithesis 
of Saul. His office is in a cramped 
corner of a storefront nail salon, 
he drives a vulgar yellow car 
that’s a far cry from the smooth 
Caddy that he drove in “Breaking 
Bad” and he barely makes $700 
defending a couple of little teenage 
shits who jerked off into a severed 
head. But even through these 
pathetic endeavors, Odenkirk’s 
performance 
shines 
with 
a 

familiar charisma. His name is 
Jimmy and he’s got a sleeper sofa 
in his office, but this dude is Saul 
Goodman to the core.

But more than escaping his 

dire financial situation and get-
ting cases that don’t involve mas-
turbating into severed heads, 
what Jimmy really craves is some 
adventure in his life. He recalls 
the days he was known as “Slip-
pin’ Jimmy” of Cicero, the kid who 
slid on every icy surface in Chicago 
and collected every injury check 
he could get his hands on. When 
Jimmy literally runs into a couple 
of skater punks and realizes that 
their intentional dive in front of 
his car was a Slippin’ Jimmy-level 
scheme, he can’t help but want to 
join up. The kids know the busi-
ness and Jimmy knows the chem-
istry, so they team up to rip off an 
embezzling bureaucrat and reap-
propriate his stolen cash into their 
empty pockets. Unlike Walter 

White, Jimmy McGill already has 
the slimy DNA, and all he needs is 
one catalyst to help him break bad.

Where “Better Call Saul” fal-

ters, though, is in its shameless 
homage to its parent series. The 
show makes a fairly convincing 
case for why it should be seen as 
a separate entity from “Breaking 
Bad,” but “Saul” still occasionally 
slips back into “Breaking Bad”-
lite territory. The premiere’s 
opening shows Saul working in a 
Nebraska Cinnabon store, frown-
ing and making melancholy cin-
namon rolls to an incongruous 
musical 
soundtrack. 
Stylisti-

cally, the black and white visu-
als and montage editing could 
be straight out of an episode of 
“Breaking Bad,” but the scene 
also lacks a more metaphorical 
color. In showing viewers what 
happened to Saul after he left the 
“Breaking Bad” universe, “Saul” 
assumes that its viewers need 
a cheap hook to engage with 
Jimmy’s story. “Breaking Bad” is 
dead and gone, and “Saul” would 
be wiser not to dig up its bones.

“Better Call Saul” also spot-

lights a few “Breaking Bad” 
alums in addition to Odenkirk, 
Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan 
Banks, “Community”) and Tuco 
Salamanca 
(Raymond 
Cruz, 

“Major Crimes”) in the first two 
episodes alone. Their characters 
are incorporated with varying 
degrees of success. Mike runs the 
booth at the parking lot where 
Jimmy parks his car, and while 
it’s great to see Banks again, the 
fact that he’s manning a park-
ing lot booth makes little sense. 
Wasn’t Mike supposed to be a for-
mer Philadelphia cop? Does this 
parking lot nonsense take place 
before or after he became a pro-
fessional “fixer” and henchman? 
Why didn’t he continue to give 
Saul shit about always forgetting 
to pay for a fifth sticker when the 
two were in “Breaking Bad?” So 
far, Mike hasn’t been given suffi-
cient material to justify his being 
on this show, but I trust that 

Jonathan Banks wouldn’t agree 
to appear on “Saul” unless he had 
better prospects than this silly 
cameo.

At the end of the first half of 

the premiere, Jimmy finds a gun 
pointed to his face and some 
shadow in the doorway threat-
ening to shoot it. The camera 
swivels to reveal Tuco, perpetu-
ally angry and protective of his 
elderly relatives as we remember 
him from “Breaking Bad.” It’s an 
effective cliffhanger, but one that 
assumes that everyone watching 
has seen “Breaking Bad.” This 
is a dangerous assumption for a 
network to make when it needs 
a show to gather its own unique 
fanbase. Tuco is incorporated 
into the plot more smoothly in 
the next episode, but it still plays 
like a re-hashing of the episode 
“Grilled” in the second season 
of “Breaking Bad.” Tuco holds 
innocent people hostage while 
his old family member is home, 
shouts a lot and threatens them 
until a dire injury puts an end to 
the situation. Fans of the parent 
show have seen this all before, 
and it’s unfortunate that “Better 
Call Saul” so actively refuses to 
break new ground with its plot.

“Better Call Saul” doesn’t 

deserve all these comparisons. 
When you strip away its art-
less 
rehashing 
of 
“Breaking 

Bad” material, the dark humor 
is sublimely biting, and Jimmy 
is a compelling subject for char-
acter study. But “Saul” needs to 
divorce itself from Saul Good-
man, Walter White and Jesse 
Pinkman. Jimmy shouldn’t aim 
to become some mythic, law-
yer version of Heisenberg. Cor-
ruption already pumps through 
his veins, whether he’s Jimmy 
from the block, Saul the king or 
Gene in a sad mall Cinnabon – 
we know exactly who this man 
is at his core. “Better Call Saul” 
already holds promise of being 
great on its own, if only it would 
stop leaning on “Breaking Bad” 
and give this lawyer his justice.

“Oops, she wore that hat.”
What Britney taught 
me about being a fan

By GIBSON JOHNS

Daily Arts Writer

It’s the spring of 1999, and 

I’m at a party to celebrate our 
family friend’s daughter’s Con-
firmation. There’s an ornate 
buffet and open bar situated 
around the family’s beautifully 
tented backyard, and there are 
a lot of people dressed in white. 
That’s essentially all I remem-
ber about this party — after 
all, I’m six and probably bored 
mad. There’s just one excep-
tion, one moment that would 
open up my eyes and ears to a 
fascination, an obsession, an 
addiction. Just as I follow my 
family out of the party to head 
home, I hear those three piano 
chords 
that 
would 
launch 

an instantly iconic career of 
extreme peaks and valleys, of 
red leather jumpsuits and pink 
wigs, of awards shows and 
rehab, of someone who was not 
a girl but not yet a woman.

The high-pitched, delighted 

scream that follows forces me to 
turn around, intrigued, to look 
at the dancefloor. The 13-year-
old belle of the ball has her 

hands up surrounded by all of 
her BFFs, and they’re dancing 
and singing their hearts out.

Oh baby, baby / How was I 

supposed to know?

This is the first time I heard 

Britney Spears’s “... Baby One 
More Time,” and, as I leave the 
party before the song’s end, 
I’m instantly hooked. With her 
pleading, innocently distinct 
voice, and her weird way of pro-
nouncing the word “baby,” Brit-
ney instantly has my heart.

You think you know, but you 

have no idea.

In the years that followed, I 

exhibited an infatuation with 
Britney Spears that proved to 
be unrivaled by my feelings 
for anything else in my life. I 
listened to ... Baby One More 
Time — my first ever CD — every 
single day on my Walkman, and 
danced to it alone in my room. 
I had my mom buy me a new 
copy when my original one got 
too scratched, and watched the 
music videos built into the disc 
(remember “enhanced CDs”?) 
on my family’s bulky desktop 
PC.

My room was covered in 

foldable posters of a midriff-
bearing Britney from J-14 mag-
azines. I watched “TRL” every 
day after elementary school, 
hoping that Carson Daly would 
announce Britney’s latest video 
in that day’s top spot. “Making 
The Video” specials and “MTV 
Diary” were must-watch tele-
vision events. On the day her 
second album, Oops! I Did It 
Again, came out, I left a note 
in the morning before school 
for my babysitter, urging her 
to pick me up a copy before she 
came to get me from school. My 
brother and I dragged that same 
babysitter (I’m sorry, Cheryl!) 
to a matinee showing of “Cross-
roads” the day it was released. 
(I immediately dubbed it a cin-
ematic masterpiece upon leav-
ing the theater, and I still view 
it as such.) When Britney and 
*NSYNC teamed up to release 
a joint CD and VHS exclusively 
through McDonald’s, I made 
my dad drive 45 minutes across 
Long Island to the nearest loca-
tion so I could have copies of 
both. I was crazy.

Over the years, I’ve calmed 

down — with age, with an 
expansion of my horizons, with 
the trauma of Britney’s melt-
down — but there’s a part of 
me that holds onto those years 
of insatiable devotion to The 
Holy Spear-it. There’s a certain 
naiveté that comes with being 
such a diehard fan — of an art-
ist, of a sports team, of a book 
series — that prevents it from 
turning toxic or problematic. 
I’d argue that it’s actually quite 
beneficial to follow something 
so closely. My love for Britney 
taught me to channel my emo-

tions, showed me what it means 
for an artist to grow and evolve, 
allowed me to understand the 
perils of celebrity and planted 
the seed for one of my greatest 
interests: pop music.

It’s unfortunate that the 

same can’t really be said these 
days, when kids get Twitter 
accounts at age eight so they 
can join their fellow Beliebers 
in sending anonymous death 
threats to anyone who dis-
agrees with their dubious idol. 
Though I’m sure those types of 
extremes existed in the days of 
peak Britney, they weren’t near-
ly as accessible or widespread. 
In those days, my biggest use 
of the internet came through 
online games and listening to 
Britney’s ode to the World Wide 
Web, “E-mail My Heart.”

That doesn’t mean that my 

Britney-complex 
didn’t 
fuel 

any intense negative feelings 
towards other competing art-
ists and her fans. I lived in a 
household that was very much 
divided — as Britney was to 
me, Christina Aguilera was to 
my oldest brother — and we 
became genuinely heated in our 
arguments over who was the 
best. When Christina won the 
Best New Artist Grammy over 
Britney in 2000, I don’t think 
I could look my brother in the 
eyes for a few days. Of course, 
I secretly loved Christina, too, 
but I could never admit that. 
I told myself that I had to be 
100 percent Team Britney and 
anything else would count as 
betrayal.

Being a fan is a learning 

experience, and, as much as you 
don’t want to, you begin to rec-
ognize flaws in the person you 
idolize. In my case, I began to 
see the cracks in the perfectly 
spray-tanned, lip-syncing Miss 
American Dream since she was 
17. From the annulment of her 
shotgun wedding, to the “Cha-
otic” K-Fed era and the head 
shaving incident, it was impos-
sible not to admit that things 
had turned sour, to put it light-
ly. But instead of moving on to 
the next best thing, I held onto 
a glimmer of hope that, just 
maybe, she’d be back. And, as 
we all know, she would be.

The Britney of recent years 

has been occasionally hard 
to watch. She shows less of 
her gum-snapping, golly gee 
personality, her dancing isn’t 
nearly as electrifying as it once 
was and her most recent album, 
Britney Jean is unquestionably 
her worst ever — but she’s try-
ing. She’s happy. She has two 
adorable children. She’s per-
forming multiple times a week 
in Las Vegas to sold-out, ador-
ing crowds. As a fan, it’s hard 
to ask for more from someone 
who taught you so much and 
remains the source of so many 
fond memories.

Britney’s 
life 
and 
career 

have been like a circus – there’s 
always a lot going on, some acts 
are thrilling and some you’d 
rather forget. But what remains 
constant is that she’s always in 
the center, keeping your atten-
tion, whether you’re six or 22. 
Britney’s like the ringleader. 
She calls the shots. If I said I’ll 
always be a fan, would you hold 
it against me?

FILM REVIEW
Cotillard humbly 
drives ‘Two Days’

Dardenne brothers’ 
latest is an intimate 

proletarian story

By ANDREW MCCLURE

Daily Arts Writer

The Dardenne brothers, Bel-

gium’s filmmaking duo with a 
thematic itch for the proletarian 
struggle, 
don’t 

strive for any-
thing 
foreign 

to their oeuvre 
in “Two Days, 
One 
Night,” 

save 
that 
it 

revolves around 
a real movie star: 
Marion 
Cotil-

lard. With most of their previous 
works populated by non-actors, 
the high-profile Cotillard (“The 
Immigrant”) assignment presents 
both hope and despair. Stars will, 
as astronomy contends, illumi-
nate – but will they overextend? 
Will they consequently outshine 
their neighbors or overact to the 
point of bursting? Cotillard, eyes 
cast downward and as aestheti-
cally unremarkable as we’ll ever 
see her, doesn’t illuminate the 
screen. She does something bet-
ter — she consumes all the light, all 
the optimism in the film, making 
each smize all the more impactful. 
Poignantly so, she lends back light 
in subtle palmfuls.

In 2012 the director broth-

ers won the Grand Jury Prize at 
Cannes for their heart-wrencher, 
“The Kid with a Bike.” Not unlike 
“Two Days,” this film finds its 
center in an already complex 
character, too pitiful to be called 
a protagonist, but also further 
complicated by a periphery that 
plants the world as the antagonist. 
The difference of note here is that 
a kid, at first blush, is supposed to 
be complex and fractious – but a 
mother of two? There’s something 
quite unnerving about an adult 
behaving like a child, whether in 
gait or in tears or in a lack of con-
fidence. The Dardenne brothers, 

with Cotillard at the forefront, 
have done just that — confidently 
portraying the unconfidence we 
all dread.

Cotillard plays Sandra, a mar-

ried mother trying to make ends 
meet at her solar panel factory. 
This goes on until her cowork-
ers vote for a 1,000 euro ($1,200) 
bonus, and consequently have to 
let her go. Sandra doesn’t handle 
it well, as the film opens with her 
asleep in the middle of the day, only 
awoken by that phone call. The 
first impression captures her sob-
bing without restraint, and then, 
as per tradition, popping six tabs 
of Xanax. The antidepressants dry 
her ducts, but only until they don’t 
anymore, prompting another dose. 
Her friend, not pinched for cash or 
cowardly like Sandra, drags her to 
the factory to plead her boss for a 
revote, suggesting the initial bal-
lot was “influenced” by an unjust 
power. The boss, unhappy about 
it, agrees, giving her, two days and 
one night to flip a landslide 16-2 
rout against her into an in-favor 
majority.

An aloof Sandra awkwardly 

asks each of her coworkers for 
occupational — not vocational — 
CPR. Most of them either don’t 
know her well or have money 
issues of their own. What makes 
each of these home trips so naked, 
though, is how, under it all, all par-
ties involved don’t just want the 

job, they need it – giving way to 
the Dardennean ecosystem, where 
people work to live. As each epi-
sode unveils, these people, wheth-
er with Sandra or not, don’t seem 
to be living all that much anyway. 
It’s not just a money problem; it’s 
a familial problem. It’s a whatev-
er-stems-from-money 
problem, 

which is everything in these Bel-
gian neighborhoods.

Some of Sandra’s trips go well, 

and some don’t. Some are belli-
cose, some emotive and some even 
fall flaccid. What’s more is San-
dra’s peripatetic-ness, the literal 
trips and her emotional careen-
ing. We are never sure if her fickle 
smile will fleet for good or make 
a hoped-for return. There’s a 
minute in the car when her lov-
ing husband (Fabrizio Rongione, 
“Lorna’s Silence”) drives with her 
in the passenger side, and the lens, 
seated in the back, pans back and 
forth between the two. Sandra 
breaks a long-overdue suppressed 
smile, her eyes meeting his as 
a French pop song plays loudly, 
transporting Sandra’s potential 
for grace and joy without any 
guaranteed permanence.

As much as all of its ingredi-

ents mix this film into oversweet, 
it’s not. Cotillard doesn’t look like 
Cotillard, nor does she possess 
her usual onscreen aplomb. I’m 
confident that’s precisely what the 
Dardennes wanted.

Jon Stewart set to 
leave ‘Daily Show’

The comedian’s 

17-year run as host 
will end this year 

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

I’ve been in denial about this 

day since rumors surfaced that 
Jon Stewart may leave “The Daily 
Show” at the end of his current 
contract. I just couldn’t believe 
that he – someone who has held 
the same job for 17 consecutive 
years – would actually consider 
moving on to something else. I 
couldn’t consider that someone 
who has been on my television 
every day for the past few years 
might not be there anymore.

But that day is almost here. 

Comedy 
Central 
officially 

announced today that Stewart will 
leave “The Daily Show” at the end 
of the year. When he does, we’ll 
have to say goodbye to someone 
who has been the face of comedic 
satire in the ’00s. Who did we turn 
to after 9/11 to help us understand 
the tragedy? Who did we turn to 
when we wanted to hear about 
the hypocrisy of fundamental 
issues? Who else would tell us 
about the problems with a certain 
North Dakotan winter driving 
campaign?

Just watching those videos – it 

reminds me how critical his voice 
is to today’s discourse surrounding 
current 
events. 
Whenever 

something happened, whether it 
was Brian Williams inflating the 
truth, a president getting elected 
or deep-dish pizza needing to be 

taken down, I turned to Stewart 
for commentary that would both 
make me laugh and inform me. His 
insight, while sometimes crude, 
brought intelligence to discussions 
about cable news. Just watch his 
“Chaos on Bullshit Mountain” 
segment, 
which 
embodied 

everything about the hole that will 
be created by his retirement from 
the show.

Stewart has also launched the 

careers of so many of comedy’s 
most powerful voices. He helped 
propel the careers of Steve Carell, 
John Hodgman, Larry Wilmore, 
Ed Helms, Rob Corddry and Rob 
Riggle. Each of these comedians 
have achieved great successes, 
partially due to their exposure 
and work on “The Daily Show.” 
Most 
importantly, 
Stephen 

Colbert and John Oliver received 

their grassroots training first 
under Stewart, before moving on 
to launch their individual shows. 
Collectively, 
the 
three 
have 

worked to provide a humorous 
lens on discussions about the 
United States – Colbert with his 
satirical right-wing character and 
Oliver with his long segments on 
lesser-known, but serious issues.

Nevertheless, 
though 
his 

presence will be greatly missed, 
“The Daily Show” will go on. 
There are so many potential 
candidates, both in-house and 
outside of Comedy Central, that 
would also do a fantastic job in 
the role (though never in the same 
way as Stewart). Stewart’s long-
lived presence has rooted him 
as one of the most distinguished 
and respected figures in the 
world of television.

We forgive you for “Death to Smoochie.”

NCAA Tournament Bubble Watch

By ERIN LENNON 

Daily Sports Editor

It’s never too early to check the 

PairWise Rankings.

That’s a lesson the Michigan 

hockey team learned the hard 
way last season. After a loss to 
Penn State in the first round of 
the Big Ten Tournament, the 
Wolverines held their breath and 
refreshed their web pages for 
two days before learning they 
would finish 16th in the rankings, 
effectively becoming the first 
team 
out 
of 

the 
NCAA 

Tournament.

While 

college 
basketball and 
college football 
teams are at 
the mercy of 
a 
selection 

committee, 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament 
in hockey is all but decided by 
the Pairwise system, which puts 
heavy emphasis on strength 
of schedule and quality wins. 
That 
means 
early-season 

losses 
to 
inferior 
opponents 

— like Michigan’s loss to New 
Hampshire in October — can 
come back to haunt teams on the 
bubble.

Now ranked No. 12 after a 

4-1 win over Michigan State 
at Soldier Field on Saturday, 
Michigan will likely have to 
finish the regular season at No. 
12 or higher — as the 16-team 
post season includes automatic 
bids for conference tournament 
champions — if it wants to avoid 
a repeat of last March. If not, 
the Wolverines will be forced 
to win at least one game in the 
conference tournament for the 
third straight season.

Even one loss to conference 

bottom-feeders 
in 
Wisconsin 

or Ohio State could keep the 
nation’s top offense — a favorite 
to win the Big Ten title over 
reigning champion Minnesota — 
from competing against the top 
defenses in the postseason.

And the Wolverines are well 

aware of the situation.

“I definitely look at it all the 

time,” said senior forward Zach 
Hyman. “I know (junior forward 
Andrew) Copp does too. We talk 
about it a lot.

“You want to be in a position 

where, if something does go 
wrong, your season’s not hanging 
on one game.”

With so many qualified teams 

in the hunt for those 16 spots, the 
Wolverines will simply have to 
win.

In the meantime, Michigan 

will root for teams like No. 
5 Michigan Tech and No. 16 
UMass-Lowell and hope that 
No. 19 Penn State and Minnesota 
continue to win against anyone 
but 
the 
Wolverines. 
They’ll 

look 
for 

consistently 
strong teams 
like 
Boston 

University 
and 
Boston 

College 
to 

stumble 
heading 
into 

the 
final 

stretch of the 
season.

Here’s 
the 

Daily’s look at “the bubble” as it 
stands with six weeks remaining 
in the regular season:

No. 11 Boston College: If 

Boston College played Michigan 
10 times, the Eagles would win 
five.

That is to say that these 

two teams have been neck and 
neck in the rankings all season 

and have been comparable in 
almost every aspect of their 
games. And like the Wolverines, 
Boston College has played just a 
handful of games over the last 
few weeks.

The Eagles are competing in 

one of the toughest conferences, 
though, meaning their next four 
games against ranked opponents 
will likely determine their fate 
before March.

No. 13 Quinnipiac: A program 

that appeared in the Frozen Four 
out of the ECAC just three years 
ago, Quinnipiac is no stranger 
to late-season hot streaks. It’s 
unbeaten in its last four contests 
against ranked opponents. The 
Bobcats sit atop the league with a 
13-2-1 record and stand to benefit 
from conference challengers who 
have beaten up on one another — 
Quinnipiac boasts five more wins 
than Dartmouth, Harvard and 
Yale, who sit at third, fourth and 
fifth place, respectively, in the 
ECAC.

No. 16 Harvard: Once a 

surprise top-five team that stuck 
around long after nonconference 
play, 
Harvard 
has 
dropped 

significantly in the rankings 
after losing three straight games, 
including losses to rival Yale and 
Boston University. In addition to 
Boston College, the Crimson will 

take on Cornell — another team 
looking to return to the rankings 
— on Monday.

No. 19 Yale : Having navigated 

through the first half of its 
conference schedule with only 
one loss, the Bulldogs were 
most recently lifted by a win 
over Harvard. From here, Yale 
will play Union, RPI, Princeton, 
Colgate and Cornell — all of 
which have struggled this season 
— which stand only to improve 
Yale’s standing come March.

No. 20 Penn State: Michigan 

is all too familiar with the 
Nittany Lions’ season-ruining 
potential. Penn State is coming 
off of a sweep of Wisconsin after 
having beaten No. 15 Vermont at 
home. The third-year program is 
second in the Big Ten, only one 
game behind the Wolverines in 
the win column. Penn State has 
proven it can win over ranked 
opponents throughout the year 
and should be considered a 
favorable candidate to win the 
Big Ten Tournament if it can’t 
sneak its way in on record alone.

And as luck would have it, 

Michigan and Penn State will 
meet for their final regular-
season series in Happy Valley on 
March 7 in what could be another 
make-or-break 
matchup 
for 

these two bubble teams.

Days from opener,
‘M’ looks forward 

By BEN FIDELMAN 

Daily Sports Writer

Whether it’s been indoors 

at Oosterbaan Field House or 
on the frosty turf of Ray Fisher 
Stadium, the Michigan baseball 
team is tired of being teased with 
practices and scrimmages — it’s 
ready for the real thing.

Not only will Friday’s opening 

day satisfy that craving for real 
gameplay, it will also usher 
in this fresh 2015 season for 
a program that has the talent 
and experience to make a 
push for the postseason. At 
the team’s Leadoff Banquet 
on Saturday night, Michigan 
coaches and players highlighted 
the program’s rich history and 
tradition.

During his opening remarks, 

coach Erik Bakich asked all 
former 
Michigan 
baseball 
players 
in 

the 
crowd 

to 
stand, 

summoning 
about 
15 

alumni. Next, 
he asked for 
all 
players 

that had won 
a 
Big 
Ten 

Championship to rise, which 
resulted in nearly all of the 
former players rising again. As 
a climax, he asked for all former 
players who had won national 
championships to stand, but just 
two rose.

Bakich, along with senior 

captains Eric Jacobson and 
Donnie Eaton, said that the 
Wolverines have always played 
with the knowledge of their rich 
heritage, but this year will be a 
little different.

“We 
tried 
to 
take 
(that 

tradition) on the team this year,” 
Eaton said. “The block ‘M’ is 
something that means a lot to us, 
and is very special. Seeing the 
guys in this room that have won 
the Big Ten, and have been to 
Omaha, that’s something that’s 
tough for us to watch and that 
we want to go after.”

Michigan 
last 
won 
the 

conference in 2008, which was 
also the last time the Wolverines 
made it through to the 64-team 
NCAA Tournament.

Multiple publications recently 

released 
their 
preseason 

predictions for the conference, 
and Michigan was mentioned 
often. Baseball America projects 
that the Wolverines will make it 
back to the regionals this year, 
playing as a No. 3 seed in the 
Nashville region.

Though 
the 
team 
travels 

to California this weekend to 
begin the season, conference 
play doesn’t begin until March 
20, and the NCAA tournament 
starts in late May. The coaching 
staff recognizes the lengthy 
season, and while there’s always 
a goal to make it to Omaha, it 
finds it more important to worry 
about the day-to-day progress of 

the team.

“There 
are 

two types of 
goals,” Bakich 
said. “There are 
process 
goals 

and 
there’s 

result 
goals. 

It’s important 
to know what 
your 
result 

goals are. For 
us, we want to 

go to the College World Series 
and win a championship. That’s 
a long way away, so it can’t be 
our focus. Our focus has to be 
on what can we do today to be 
the highest and best version of 
ourselves today, because today is 
all that matters.”

Most 
of 
the 
preseason 

polls have Michigan finishing 
somewhere in the middle of the 
conference, around fourth or 
fifth place, but nearly all have 
the Wolverines as a potential 
sleeper team to take the Big Ten 
crown.

Getting off to a solid non-

conference start is going to be 
key for the Wolverines if they 
have hopes of an at-large bid to 
the NCAA field — something 
that will be especially hard 
with the team on the road 
for the first six weeks of the 
season.

Late collapse dooms ‘M’

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Writer

When 
Kim 
Barnes 
Arico 

became the coach of the Michigan 
women’s basketball team in 2012, 
she inherited a team that hadn’t 
just struggled in rivalry games — 
it had been 
dominated 
in them.

In their first 41 seasons, the 

Wolverines 
had 
a 
combined 

26-113 record against Michigan 
State and Ohio State. In the most 
hotly contested games of each 
season, Michigan simply could 
never match up to its rivals.

But 
Tuesday 
night 
in 

Columbus, Team 42 had a chance 
to accomplish a never-before-seen 
feat: completing season sweeps of 
both the Spartans and Buckeyes.

And with a 62-49 lead with 

9:10 remaining in the game, the 
Wolverines seemed poised to 
do just that. In a game where it 
controlled the rebounding battle, 
50-40, Michigan was on its way 
to a second straight road rivalry 
victory after beating Michigan 
State last Thursday.

But 
with 
senior 
forwards 

Cyesha Goree and Nicole Elmblad 
in foul trouble, the Wolverines 
allowed a 12-0 Ohio State run that 
cost them their chance at history. 
The Buckeyes (9-4 Big Ten, 17-8 
overall) 
dominated 
Michigan, 

28-11, in the final nine minutes 
to pull off an improbable 77-73 
victory.

Ohio 
State 
guard 
Kelsey 

Mitchell, the nation’s leading 
scorer, scored 19 second-half 
points to lead the comeback. Her 
layup with 4:41 remaining put the 
Buckeyes on top, 65-64, for the 
first time since early in the first 
half.

Michigan (6-7, 14-10) briefly 

took the lead back on a pair of free 
throws by senior guard Shannon 
Smith before Ohio State guard 

Cait Craft put her team ahead 
for good with another contested 
layup.

Goree 
spent 
an 
extended 

period of time on the bench, but 
with the Wolverines struggling 
on both sides of the ball without 
her, Barnes Arico was forced to 
send her back out with four fouls. 
Goree ultimately fouled out with 
5:12 to go.

“I don’t think we really had 

a choice,” Barnes Arico said. 
“Nicole Elmblad had four fouls, 
too. Every time we made a run, it 
felt like, (Goree) was in the game. 
It was important for us to try to 
get her back in.”

Despite playing with four fouls 

and without Goree alongside her, 
Elmblad made an admirable effort 
to keep the Wolverines in the 
game. In addition to her season-
high 14 points, Elmblad grabbed 
a career-high 15 rebounds, many 
of which came in the form of put-
backs on the offensive glass.

“She was unbelievable, she was 

all over the place,” Barnes Arico 
said. “She just was a presence out 
there today. I was so happy for 
her. It was so great for her to have 
a night like this. But I’m sure she 
would’ve preferred the victory 
over her career night.”

Michigan’s early dominance 

in the paint put it in a position 
to run away with the game. The 
Wolverines’ 17 offensive rebounds 
gave their shooters several second 
chances — the most notable being 
a 
3-pointer 
from 
sophomore 

guard 
Siera 
Thompson 
that 

gave Michigan a lead it didn’t 
relinquish for over 20 minutes.

But the Wolverines’ physical 

play quickly caught up with them. 
After the defense held Mitchell to 
just three points for the majority 
of the first half, Thompson 
fouled Mitchell on a desperation 
3-pointer 
with 
1.4 
seconds 

remaining — the shot dropped in, 
and Mitchell converted the four-
point play.

The foul was one of 25 for the 

Wolverines, who saw both Goree 
and Smith foul out. Elmblad 
and sophomore guard Danielle 
Williams each finished with four.

Though 
freshman 
forward 

Jillian Dunston contributed a 
career-high seven rebounds off 
the bench, Michigan’s defense 
couldn’t prevent a late-game 
collapse with so many key players 
limited by foul trouble.

And 
just 
like 
that, 
the 

Wolverines’ shot at history was 
gone.

Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman’s missed attempt at a 
buzzer-beating 3-pointer Sunday 
afternoon at Indiana was emblem-
atic of the Michigan men’s basket-
ball team’s midseason malaise in 
more ways than one.

Had the freshman guard’s shot 

found its way in, the Wolverines 
would have forced overtime. The 
game continued Michigan’s trend 
— with an ugly 72-54 loss to Iowa 
on Feb. 5 serving as the excep-
tion — of taking high-profile Big 
Ten opponents down to the wire 
before faltering when it matters 
most.

On Jan. 24, sophomore guard 

Derrick Walton Jr., currently 
confined to the bench with a foot 
injury, hit a game-tying 3-pointer 
to force overtime against Wiscon-
sin. The Badgers used the final 
five minutes to take a five-point 
lead, eventually pulling away for a 
69-64 win.

On Feb. 1 in East Lansing, senior 

forward Max Bielfeldt’s tip-in 
forced overtime against Michigan 
State. But Michigan couldn’t get 
anything going in overtime and 
lost, 76-66.

The 2014-15 Wolverines aren’t 

as good as the 2013-14 squad for 
many reasons, some more appar-
ent than others. On the surface, 
the biggest issues stem from 
the loss of Michigan’s two most 
productive players this season: 
Walton and junior guard Caris 

LeVert. Losing three players to 
the NBA — Glenn Robinson III, 
Mitch McGary and Nik Stauskas 
— hasn’t helped, either.

The Wolverines also suffer 

from a general lack of size at the 
forward spots, with 6-foot-6 soph-
omore Zak Irvin often forced to 
play power forward and 6-foot-7 
Max Bielfeldt getting substantial 
minutes at the ‘5’ spot.

Below, the Daily breaks down 

how those changes have manifest-
ed themselves numerically (many 
of the numbers were calculated 
by college basketball statistician 
Ken Pomeroy), discussing five 
key statistical categories in which 
the Wolverines have improved, 
regressed or maintained their 
level of play from last season.

SHOOTING: As simple as it 

seems, Michigan is losing games 
it would have won in 2013-14 
because the Wolverines aren’t 
shooting the ball the way they 
used to.

Last year, Michigan ranked 

fourth nationally in 3-point shoot-
ing percentage, at 40.2 percent. 
This season, the Wolverines are 
ranked 155th in the category at 
just 34.5 percent.

The drop-off from inside the 

arc has been just as substantial. 
The Wolverines’ 52.7 percent 
field-goal shooting ranked 26th 
nationally last season, but this 
year, Michigan is converting on 
just 46.3 of its attempts, good for 
227th nationally out of 351 Divi-
sion I teams.

Given that the Wolverines rank 

33rd in the country in 
3-point attempts per 
field goals attempted 
(41.7 percent), it’s no 
wonder the six-point 
drop-off in conversion 
rate from beyond the 
arc is leading to severe 
consequences.

That’s what losing 

Stauskas did — now 
playing for the NBA’s 
Sacramento 
Kings, 

the Canadian stand-
out 
attempted 
208 

3-pointers for Michi-
gan last season and 
converted 
on 
44.2 

percent of them.

TURNOVERS: 

As much as Michigan 
coach John Beilein’s squad has 
seen offensive drop-off from last 
year to the current one, turnovers 
haven’t been the issue.

The 2013-14 Wolverines turned 

the ball over on 14.8 percent of their 
possessions, giving them the coun-
try’s 16th-lowest turnover rate. 
This year’s team is lagging behind 
slightly at 16.2 percent, but that fig-
ure still puts them at 26th nation-
ally. That’s impressive, especially 
in light of the fact that Michigan is 
currently starting two guards who 
hadn’t had substantial experience 
in college basketball prior to Janu-
ary: Abdur-Rahkman and fellow 
freshman Aubrey Dawkins.

Defensively, 
the 
Wolverines 

are actually forcing more turn-
overs than they did last season — 
Michigan’s opponents are turning 

the ball over on 20.6 percent of 
their possessions, higher than the 
national average of 19.5 percent. 
Last year, the Wolverines ranked 
245th nationally in forced-turn-
over rate, forcing their opponents 
to cough the ball up on just 17.1 
percent of possessions, compared 
to the national average of 18.3.

BLOCKS: 
The 
Wolverines, 

likely due to their smaller ros-
ter, are getting shots blocked at a 
higher clip than they did last sea-
son. Michigan is getting stuffed 
on 9.2 percent of its 2-point shot 
attempts, compared to 8.4 percent 
last season.

Worse, on defense, the Wolver-

ines rank 332nd in block percent-
age, making contact with just 5.3 
percent of opponents’ attempts 
from inside the arc. It wasn’t pret-
ty last year, either, but the 2013-14 

team’s 6.3 percent block rate put it 
substantially closer to the national 
average.

Beyond the roster’s smaller size 

is its inexperience — while last 
year, the bulk of Michigan’s min-
utes at the ‘5’ came from veterans 
like Jordan Morgan and Jon Hor-
ford, inexperienced players have 
accounted for most of the playing 
time in the low post this season.

PACE: Beilein’s teams are noto-

rious for taking their time on the 
offensive end — the Wolverines 
currently have an average offen-
sive possession length of 20.4 
seconds. That’s seven-tenths of 
a second higher than last year’s 
figure, which isn’t a substantial 
difference. Both this year and last, 
Michigan spent roughly two more 
seconds on each possession than 
the national average.

BENCH MINUTES: Perhaps 

least surprising of all, Michigan is 
asking for roughly one-third more 
minutes from its bench this year as 
compared to 2013-14. The Wolver-
ine bench currently accounts for 
33.3 percent of Michigan’s total 
minutes played — last season, it 
made up for just 25 percent. That 
brings Michigan in line with the 
national average of 32.5 percent.

That figure is also deceptively 

low, as Abdur-Rahkman, Dawkins 
and even junior guard Spike 
Albrecht — who leads Michigan’s 
active scorers — might not be fix-
tures in the starting lineup were 
it not for the injuries to LeVert 
and Walton. Effectively, the vast 
majority of the Wolverines’ min-
utes are going to players who were 
expected to come off the bench as 
of early January.

HOW TO SPEND GALENTINE’S DAY

Wednesday, February 11, 2015 // The Statement

L

ast week I closed the pages 
to the first Marilynne Rob-
inson book I’ve ever read, 

Gilead.

This book is highly religious, 

philosophical and spiritual but pri-
marily a reflective and meditative 
book. Its narrator is a seventy-six 
year old Congregationalist pastor 
living in the town of Gilead, Iowa in 
the 1950s. He is writing a letter to 
his seven-year-old son reflecting on 
his life as he is dying from coronary 
heart disease.

Robinson herself was raised 

Presbyterian but later became 
Congregationalist 
and 
believes 

strongly in the theology of John 
Calvin, as she has stated in many 
interviews.

At first I resisted the book, 

expecting the narrator to shove 
religious beliefs down the reader’s 
throats. But quickly, I began to 
realize the genius behind Robin-
son’s characters. They evaluated 
universal struggles and put a spiri-
tual and self-reflective perspective 
to problem solving. They were not 
aggressive, overbearing or all-
knowing.

In an interview on “The Daily 

Show with John Stewart,” Rob-
inson discusses the similarities 
between science and religion, a 
topic she centers around in her 
book Absence of the Mind.

I so often absorbed and did not 

question this idea that there is sci-

ence and then there is religion, and 
the two are pitted against each 
other. Robinson argues differently, 
that the discrepancies are not so 
black and white.

“I think that people on side of 

the argument have declared the 
authority of science but they have 
not construed an argument that 
actually satisfied the standards of 
science,” Robinson said.

In a recent online TED discus-

sion, one commenter, Richard 
Krooman, argued that people con-

fuse science as fact, when 
in reality even if you can 
measure a concept that 
does not mean you fully 
understand it.

“The foundation of sci-

ence, however, is that we 
believe what we perceive 
and we assume that when 
our description of it is cor-
rect the physics behind it 
is too,” Krooman wrote. 
“We must never forget 
that all we (scientists) do 
is describe the events in 
such a way that our math 
explanation of it can 
insanely closely (up to the 
point where we have full 
belief in it) show what will 
happen.”

When considering this 

nuance of science, I have 
come to realize science is 
making an argument that 

discounts faith, but in reality, much 
like religion, science relies in faith.

For example, I think of the natu-

ral phenomenon of gravity. Though 
there are equations that prove this 
scientific concept, it would be hard 
to believe gravity existed if you 
didn’t experience being held down 
to the ground you are walking on 
each day.

This is the same for religious 

experiences. You may not believe in 
God or a higher guiding spirit until 
you are in a position in life where 
you are tested, struggle, and expe-
rience the support. Without this 
tangible experience, you would not 
have faith.

Science is a system of explaining 

why things happen in the world and 
so, in a way, science is its own reli-
gious sect.

Religion breaks through and 

expands human’s understandings 
of the world, just as science does. 
Religion pushes at the barriers of 
human language, just as science 
does. Religion has been created 
from and is limited by the human 
mind, just as science has.

In our society, political groups 

have alienated religion and science 
into two separate lines of thinking, 
but this division is not always nec-
essary. Religion and science should 
work together to better understand 
each other and the reasons explain-
ing our complicated world.

Made famous by the ever-chipper Leslie Knope of “Parks and 
Rec,” Galentine’s Day takes place Feb. 13 and celebrates female 
friendship instead of stupid boys 
— here’s how you can ring it in.

1. 50 SHADES OF NO
Jamie Dornan’s Christian Grey is undeniably foxy. But let’s not spend 
money on a franchise that fetishizes sexual assault, yes? If you really 
need to see it, download it illegally online like regular porn. 

2. GILMORE GIRLS MARATHON
What better way to spend a day with your girls than watching the 
Girls? Arguing over Rory’s boyfriends is a best-friendship rite of 
passage. (Older, put-together writer Jess for the win.)

3. CREPES AND MIMOSAS
We all can be classy if we really try. Ring Galentine’s in with a 
homemade brunch 
— if you are really adventurous, give it a theme, 

like Badass Literary Ladies or “Magic Mike 2.”

4. PLATONIC LOVE LETTERS
Yup, shamelessly piling on the cheese. Write a note telling your gal 
pal why you are glad she’s in your life. These are the things we will 
treasure in forty years when paper is obsolete.

5. GET SHIT DONE 
Strong, independent, ambitious women don’t have time to sit 
around. Do your homework, save the world, but do it with your 
girlfriends at your side. Who run the world?

All the Pretty Things: Snow days

V

oices of sportscasters mix 
with the tapping of laptop 
keys as my friends and I 

watch the SuperBowl half-heart-
edly while finishing the homework 
that should have been done much 
earlier in the weekend. Snow falls 
perpetually outside, as I joke, 
“There’s no way we will have class,” 
to which my buds reply, “You don’t 
understand how this school works, 
you are a freshman,” as the Patri-
ots score a touchdown. We look up, 
just the slightest bit interested for a 
few seconds, and then return back 
to our work. The night was like any 
other Sunday night, with the feeling 
of another week of classes to bring 
the mood to a semi-sad, semi-tired 
feeling. The only thing to keep our 
moods up seemed to be the outra-
geous halftime show, where Katy 
Perry rode a terrifying metal tiger.

We continue with our work, unin-

terested in the outcome of the game, 
when suddenly my friend leaps from 
her bed, “You guys, we have a snow 
day!” We all laugh, completely con-
vinced that somebody was trolling 
her, “Sit down, you can’t do that to 
us.” She sits down, a little defeated. 
We joke about the condescending 
tweet that the University sent out 
just an hour before, ensuring that all 
students would be attending class 
the next day. We had very little to be 
hopeful for.

My other friend jumps from her 

seat, “She isn’t lying, we do not have 
school tomorrow!” as she whips 
around to show us her laptop screen 
with the beautiful red bar across the 
screen that sent the entire campus 

into a frenzy.

Immediately 
we 
jump 
up, 

the halls filled with students all 
screaming the good news. Music 
blares from rooms all around us, 
and for the first time ever our hall 
seemed sort of like we were close 
(for maybe two minutes). Droves 
of students flocked the streets in 
search of an impromptu snowball 
fight or party. We turn on music 
and have a celebratory dance party 
for about two hours, with intermit-
tent questioning of where we were 
going that night. Finally decid-
ing that it is best to just stay in, we 
settle down for the night, ready for 
food and a movie. The night turns to 
early morning as we watch another 
sickly-sweet Nicholas Sparks film, 

and chow on our leftover guac from 
the SuperBowl. We drift off know-
ing that the next day we have more 
time to pull ourselves together and 
recover.

Pretty snowflakes fell outside, 

securing our day off. A great feeling 
overcame us: we have all night, and 
all day to make more memories, to 
enjoy one another’s company, with-
out the scratching of a pencil or the 
tapping of a laptop. We were able to 
just enjoy life because we had one 
more day. The next day would bring 
frantic studying and extra loads of 
laundry, but the feeling of a snow 
day never goes away. From being 
a kid to now, a snow day is an extra 
day at freedom, at more time to just 
be.

ETROIT — No one talks about marriage equality at 
the Ruth Ellis Center. The idea of bringing it up seems 
ethereal, unnecessary in the way a marginal inconve-

nience slinks out of grasp. The reason, as Jessie Fullenkamp, 
the Center’s director of mental health services explains, is 
straightforward: why concentrate your efforts on making 
sure the law recognizes your marital status when, in reality, 
it doesn’t even protect your right to work, to live in and rent 
property without the constant, overhanging threat of discrimi-
nation?

In Michigan, citizens can be fired or removed from hous-

ing if they identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. 
The state is one of 29 in the country that does not offer civil 
rights protections based on sexual orientation. The latest effort 
to alter Michigan’s Elliott Larsen Act, which includes other 
protections such as gender and race, stalled in committee last 
December.

“You can’t arrange your priorities around marriage,” Ful-

lenkamp says. “If you think about it, a lot of the current pro-
LGBTQ rhetoric has been set forward by white, middle class 
Americans who, often, don’t consider that there are people out 
there completely cut off from their families, living on nothing 
because they aren’t straight.”

The Ruth Ellis Center is isolated. It’s big and red and 

drenched in a pall that can be only partially attributed to the 
abandoned minivan gathering rust across the street. It’s the 
biggest, reddest building in the vicinity of the much bigger, 
redder fire station just a block away, and, like a worn fortress, 
its walls are an expanse of molded brick. On a stretch of iced 
Detroit roads, occasionally blemished by the grayish weeds 
clambering through scars in the asphalt, the Center looks still. 
Dignified. Somehow out of place.

Next to the forgotten SUV and the looming fire house, there’s 

a family-owned bakery that seems perpetually drowsy. From 
its perch a hundred yards in the opposite direction, a Popeyes 
Louisiana Kitchen bathes it all in an empty, neon glare.

The Center looks guarded tonight. The barbed wire crown-

ing its fence stands out. Its doors are clamped shut behind a 
hunk of electrical locks, and the string of cars parked around 
the block, lengthening with every passing minute, doesn’t 
make sense. Neither does the clump of teenagers waiting to be 

buzzed in. As one of them — her back now pressed against the 
PA system she was talking into moments before — turns to face 
the man standing next to her, others swivel around to watch. 
Her fingers flutter around like butterflies while she snaps 
them, sprinkling down some unknown gauntlet at the man’s 
feet. The onlookers await a response. There’s a tense lull.

Before the silence curdles, a smile breaks across the pair’s 

face and they grab each other’s forearms, their feet toeing 
the ground in synchrony to make a broken circle in the snow. 
The PA system’s robotic buzz cuts the celebration short. And 
beneath Popeyes’ stare, the small party of teens seems genu-
inely excited about the big, red building getting ready to swal-
low them whole.

“The Ruth Ellis Center’s mission is to work with youth who 

are experiencing homelessness and identify as lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender or questioning,” Fullenkamp said. “We 
have a residential facility where youth who are in foster care 
live with us. We also have a street outreach program. We have 
mental health services, where we do both individual or family 
work to reaffirm and support LGBTQ identities.”

The name Ruth Ellis comes from an activist who lived in 

Detroit for much of her eighty-five years as an out lesbian, 
becoming the first woman in Detroit to own a printing busi-
ness and tenaciously advocating for LGBTQ and Black rights. 
Her house became a hub of activist fervor in the city, and today 
the residence is structured as an Intensive Treatment Unit 
set apart from the Center, which is open to any youth seeking 
short-term care.

The Center’s residential program, simply labeled “Ruth’s 

House,” is for runaway children between the ages of twelve 
and seventeen looking for permanent housing immediately 
after leaving their families.

These children are in the custody of Michigan’s foster care 

system or the juvenile justice system and are referred by the 
state’s Department of Human Services, sometimes even out-of-
state care programs

Fullenkamp relays this information with the air of someone 

who has repeated it hundreds of times. Having worked at the 
Center for four years, she says it with practiced enunciation, 
her voice rising and falling as she gauges her audience’s under-
standing of each program.

Part of her job — which often sees her working from early 

in the morning to 9:00 p.m., when the facility’s drop-in hours 

usually end — requires that she visit local colleges for speaking 
engagements. There, she gives long, intensive lectures some-
times about Ruth Ellis, though almost always related to sexual 
orientation and gender identity.

This one, at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, is 

called “LGBTQ 101,” and is accompanied by a thin sheaf of doc-
uments featuring titles like “Terminology Related to Lesbian, 
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People,” “Frequently Asked 
Questions about Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity” and 
“The Heterosexual Questionnaire.” On the back of the packet, 
there’s a full-page diagram of “The Genderbread Person,” a 
ginger-baked representation of sexual fluidity who shepherds 
you through varying tiers of Identity, Attraction, Sex and 
Expression.

This informality and a lack of urgency feels visible through-

out the presentation. It’s there, towards the end, when Fullen-
kamp makes a joke about having to discuss different forms of 
intimacy with different people.

“Anal intercourse, vaginal intercourse, oral intercourse, out-

ercourse — which is an umbrella term for holding hands, kiss-
ing … whenever we do this presentation with high schoolers,” 
she riffs, “we end up spending about ten minutes talking about 
dry humping. It’s their favorite.”

She gets laughs, and a few minutes later, closes with another 

swift pitch about donating to Ruth Ellis. She glides through the 
two-hour talk like a seasoned pro, and though always calm, her 
demeanor feels vastly different than when she’s counseling at 
the Center.

After being buzzed in, the teens ascend the flight of stairs 

that welcome them into the main hull of the two-story prem-
ises: a portly reception desk that sits across a row of old looking 
couches. Behind the desk, Q. Watkins, a youth outreach coor-
dinator, maintains a running log of the people flowing through 
the Center as the night’s drop-in hours officially begin.

Often, the banter between her and some of the other out-

reach coordinators bleeds into more informal conversations 
with the youth. This particular night — with forty kids already 
filing into the rec room — is especially chaotic. Within the next 
hour, the Center will kick off its annual ball — a dance fash-
ioned after an underground LGBTQ practice in which com-
petitors amble down makeshift catwalks or dance floors while 
vying for trophies.

Hashing out the night’s food arrangements with another 

employee, Watkins rarely stops commenting on the deluge of 
activity unfolding around her. Teenagers sift through a large 
rack of clothes occupying an entire hallway.

As a tall, lanky guest pulls on a short skirt and loses his 

T-shirt for a blouse, Watkins chimes in: “You’re showing a little 
nipple there, Adrian.”

When Adrian brandishes two upturned middle fingers and 

responds with a wide, arcing pirouette, she claps. Before she 
was a member of the staff, Watkins got involved with Ruth 
Ellis when her girlfriend at the time was kicked out of her home 
after coming out as a lesbian. Initially, her girlfriend moved in 
with Watkins and her parents, but facing financial problems 
and an inability to support an additional family member, they 
decided it would be best to seek help at the Center.

“The rest is history. I went from being a summer intern to an 

outreach coordinator,” she says. “And one of most bittersweet 
experiences working here has been the ability to see that in 
other people. To see these youth when they first come in and 
are still there a year later.”

“It can be a humbling experience, knowing that a lot of them 

still can’t talk about something as basic as this with their loved 
ones.” she adds. “It made me realize how privileged I was to 
have affirming parents who actively created an affirming envi-
ronment.”

Excitement bubbles up again when conversation drifts back 

to the ball.

“Fifty people already here and it isn’t even five o’clock,” she 

says. “I remember in the Halloween ball how most of the youth 
became extremely involved with their costumes and it got out 
of hand — in a good way. We’ll see what happens tonight.”

The ball has a more functional purpose to go along with its 

casually festive premise.

Tonight, while hordes of teenagers shimmy across the 

Center’s expansive dance floor to thumping house music, 
Fullenkamp quietly picks them off one at a time to conduct 
abbreviated meetings in her office. The topic of discussion is 
a small survey distributed every two years by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development.

The survey starts with questions like “What are the last four 

digits of your social security number?” and gradually probes 
for information regarding long-term, problematic relation-
ships and whether or not the subject has experienced domestic 
violence. Ultimately, though, the focus turns to housing status.

The goal, Fullenkamp explains, is to determine how much 

funding or public housing can be made available by the govern-
ment to those being interviewed. In a phrase, the needier the 
person appears on paper, the higher on the queue their name is 
placed for any available residence.

“It’s not a catch-all system, but it’s one of the only ways we 

have right now to try and get a feel for what’s going on or how 
to best meet people where they are,” she says. “A lot of the 
youth here might not be literally homeless, sleeping on a park 
bench or in the streets right now, but there’s a very good chance 
that within the next year they will.”

Based on the data gathered through the survey at the Cen-

ter and most other advocacy centers throughout the city, the 
Homeless Action Network of Detroit decides how best to por-
tion lots from public housing projects. The bureaucratic rigma-
role becomes doubly frustrating for non-profits like the Ruth 
Ellis Center, considering the lack of attention these govern-
ing agencies devote to the interconnectivity of homeless and 
homosexuality in lower-income neighborhoods.

The Center is one of only four organizations in the country 

solely dedicated to serving runaway, homeless, at-risk LGBTQ 
youth — and the only one in the entire Midwest. Small numbers 
give way to marginalization.

“The problem in Detroit is that there are very little resourc-

es for victims of domestic abuse, and fewer still for same-sex 
partners who are often experiencing similar problems,” she 
continues. “They’re still not recognized, which creates a really 
unhealthy atmosphere of isolation that only makes the problem 
worse.”

There’s no dedicated source of funding within the $24 mil-

lion pot HAND handles annually for individuals who have 
come out as gay. In their yearly State of Homelessness Report, 
the organization doesn’t even acknowledge the existence of 
LGBTQ individuals.

This shortfall — despite a growing number of reports that 

indicate the number of LGBTQ youth on the streets — is 
increasing by a sizable margin every year. And in poverty-
stricken, urban areas like Detroit, the epidemic is especially 
worrisome. A 2012 study conducted by the Williams Institute 
found that between 20 and 40 percent of homeless youths iden-
tify as LGBTQ — double the percentage of adolescents nation-
ally who are openly gay. Further research by the National 
Coalition for the Homeless found that homeless LGBTQ ado-

lescents are more than twice as likely to commit suicide as 
their heterosexual counterparts.

According to Fullenkamp, the trouble often arises from a 

painstakingly stringent verification process. The verifications 
are used to weed out applicants, discrediting information given 
by people seeking federal vouchers.

“Anybody who’s ever been in a position where they’ve had 

to ask for something understands how dehumanizing that pro-
cess can be, and the system is set up to reinforce those feel-
ings,” she says. “At the end of the day, you want people to feel 
safe asking for help and you want people who ask for help to 
get it.”

“But, you have to have all these verification letters that 

demand you to verify that you’re homeless,” she continues. “So 
an outreach worker would have to go with you to wherever it is 
you’re sleeping and actually see that it exists. Which is crazy, 
not only because it’s disrespectful to the individual, but also 
because it’s not at all an efficient use of the system’s time and 
money.”

The survey distributed this night is a means to find recipients 

for 200 recently released federal vouchers, and homeless agen-
cies across town are scrambling to find potential candidates. 
Though Fullenkamp insists — with a muted smile — that this 
isn’t a competition per se, each agency makes fervent efforts to 
advocate for its own clients. Some of the other organizations 
conducting surveys tonight include the Neighborhood Service 
Organization and the Coalition On Temporary Shelter, both 
of whom cater to a predominantly older, heterosexual demo-
graphic.

Some people watch as he puts them on. Stanson is the master 
of ceremonies for the night. The mic in his hand, by accident 
or careful foresight of those who hold their ear drums dear, 
remains off for the next two hours.

Stanson doesn’t need it.
Around the sweeping hardwood dance space that looks more 

like a cafeteria than a disco, he prowls. In front of the black

prizes, he pauses. And through the cacophony of chatter that

University advances stem cell technologies amid 

political contention

by Anastassios Adamopoulos, Daily Staff Reporter

“It is exciting for me to think that 
this tiny group of cells could be the 
seed to help people suffering with 

diseases in the future,” Patricia said.

Editor’s note: Upon request, some individuals interviewed for 
this article have been identified by first name only.

In the Medical Science Building at the University’s Medi-

cal School, I looked through a microscope at a 35-millimeter 
petri dish and saw microscopic organisms that could appar-
ently one day provide treatments for a host of debilitating 
genetic diseases.

These microscopic organisms are called human embry-

onic stem cell colonies.

The room is the University’s MStem Cell Laboratories, 

which develops human embryonic stem cell lines from 
disease-affected embryos. Last month The Michigan Daily 
reported on one such stem cell line developed from an 
embryo that had been donated by a University alumna.

But as the University looks to grow such efforts, it remains 

unclear how the current political landscape might alter the 
path of such research.

The difficulty in studying genetic diseases is observ-

ing how they begin and how they grow. Without access to 
the formation of the cells, scientists cannot know what the 
developmental process is. Embryonic stem cell lines can — to 
some extent — solve this problem by showing scientists how 
a mutation develops.

“(It is) important to understand how mutations give rise to 

the pathology,” said Gary Smith, director of the MStem Cell 
Laboratories. “Knowing how a mutation results in a neuron 
that functions abnormally provides opportunities to prevent 
or treat the disease.”

It takes around 210 days to produce a single embryonic 

stem cell line. This includes about twenty to thirty rounds 
of replication and characterization to ensure the new line 
develops as needed. Once the lab has produced a success-
ful line, they freeze it and store it. Stem cells can prolifer-
ate indefinitely if they are carefully grown, so the number of 
lines that can be produced is up to the laboratory’s discretion.

“It is quite a labor-intensive project,” Smith said. “We have 

to feed these cells every other day. And we have to split them 
every seven days. It doesn’t matter if it’s on the weekend, it 
doesn’t matter if it’s on Christmas.”

Patricia, a research specialist in the lab, works on all of the 

different steps in this line production process.

“The beginning of a new line is really fascinating because 

you can see day by day how few cells start to divide to pro-
duce the first stem cells colony,” she said.

Understanding how these diseases develop is the begin-

ning of the ultimate goal of this research: finding the drugs 
to treat them.

Scientists who study these human embryonic stem cell 

lines examine how they develop into neurons or other kinds 
of specialized cells they want, and see where the mutation 
occurs. They could then find and test drugs to stop the muta-
tion from happening.

However, there are further steps that need to be taken. 

Smith pointed out that it is important to have more than one 
stem cell line for each disease, ideally from different people. 
The comparisons that could be drawn among different lines 
would lead to more conclusive results.

“I think in the future this is going to be a huge way of being 

an intermediary between animal studies and clinical trials of 
new drugs,” Smith said.

Once the production is done, the paperwork starts. The 

lab submits its findings to the National Institutes of Health so 
that the new line can be put on the Human Embryonic Stem 
Cell Registry, where organizations around the world submit 
information about the embryonic stem cell lines they have 
produced. Acceptance onto the registry depends on meeting 
the guidelines that the NIH has set.

Smith noted that so far the lab has seen great success in 

meeting the regulations put forth by the NIH — every one of 
the lines they have submitted has been accepted.

Once the stem cell line is accepted, it is on the registry for 

those interested in buying it from the lab. After reaching an 
agreement, the lab will ship the line out to the purchaser. The 
purchaser must also submit a request for a research grant by 
the NIH to work on the stem cell line.

The University’s MStem Cell Laboratories have added 

25 out of 303 total human embryonic stem cell lines on the 
registry, with another three lines currently under review. It 
has also added the most disease-specific stem cell lines in the 
past two years compared with other institutions.

While such research is widely considered cutting edge 

within scientific circles, the use of human embryos has led 
to rampant ethical debates. From 2001 to 2009, research in 
this field was stifled by federal funding restrictions passed by 
former President George W. Bush. The ban effectively pro-
hibited new lines from being created and left the scientific 
community with only twenty-one usable lines for research 
during those years, as scientists were limited to private dona-
tions and state funding to continue their research.

In March 2009, President Barack Obama signed an execu-

tive order that once again permitted federal funding for 
research on stem cells. The current National Institutes of 
Health guidelines are formatted after this executive decision. 
As a result NIH grants for studying human embryonic stem 
cell lines increased substantially, reaching $146.1 million in 
2013.

The MStem Cell Laboratories opened in 2009 as part 

of the University Stem Cell research department, after the 
adoption of the Michigan Stem Cell Amendment in 2008 that 
allowed embryo donation and production of embryonic stem 
cells for the first time in the state. The lab has employed four 
to five people over the years since its founding.

Personal Statement: What I don’t know

by Natalie Gadbois, Deputy Statement Editor

I

t was a middle school slumber party. Exhausted from 
Dance Dance Revolution, licking coarse Dorito salt 
from our fingers, we laid down in our spoke-and-wheel 

sleeping bag circle, and we talked about sex.

Jade, the party’s host and wild card of the group, was the 

first to make it personal: “I want to have sex for the first time 
when I’m a junior in high school, with someone really cute 
like Jason.” There were giggles and gasps, and I blushed, 
because for years I had quietly, earnestly had a crush on cute 
Jason.

Another girl, goofy and Catholic-bred like me, responded 

in shock. “I am waiting until I get married. I only want to 
have sex with one person ever.” Later she would go on to 
date the school dreamboat, and their do-they-or-don’t-they 
sex life was a sad constant of teenage gossip.

My turn. In typical rational, middle-of-the-line, oh what 

a nice girl fashion, I said that I wanted it to happen in col-
lege. That I didn’t need to be in love, but it had to be with 
someone I cared about. That it needed to be special, but not 
rose-petals-dripped-on-the-bed, sexy-silk-teddy special. At 
age 12 sex terrified me, with the burgeoning body parts and 
whispered talk that it hurt really, really bad. But I felt no 
shame imagining the future. Someday I was going to have 
sex, and I was really going to like it.

Eight years later, I lie on my couch watching “Jane the 

Virgin” with my best friend. I had been skeptical of the 
show’s premise — a 23-year-old woman who has never had 
sex becomes mistakenly artificially inseminated with her 
ex’s sperm. But watching it, the similarities between Jane 
and me soon became strangely apparent: we were both 
grilled cheese aficionados, insecure writers, harborers of 
Catholic guilt and modern world sensibilities, warmhearted 
and practical in equal measure. And then there’s the whole 
premise, the final nail in the coffin that links Jane and I: that 
eponymous virginity.

To the consternation of seventh-grade-me, it hasn’t hap-

pened yet. I could falsely chalk it up to the lingering rem-
nants of my Catholicism but that would oversimplify it. Or I 

could be the “chill girl” I’ve never been, say it really doesn’t 
matter to me, that it will happen when it happens. Or I could 
lie — as I have admittedly done before, during ill-advised 
games of Would You Rather in low-ceilinged basements — 
and vaguely pretend like it has happened, that I’m experi-
enced and jaded like so many others. But that would really 
be a disservice to the fragile, complex, so, so frustrating rela-
tionship I have with my sexuality. I’m a virgin, and some-
times I feel weird about it.

Reading “Pride and Prejudice” as a kid, I would joyfully 

imagine that someday when I was older and smarter and 
more beautiful — the act of falling in love and being fallen 
in love with. I’ve always been a pragmatist, independent and 
rational, but a small part of me bled for those love stories. 
Even then I didn’t equate love and sex, nor did I imagine a 
rose-colored world in which I would meet the one man of 
my dreams at the right time and the right place and the story 
would end there, happily.

I wanted love, the kind Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy had, but 

I also wanted intimate passion, like the kind Lloyd Dobbler 
and Diane had in “Say Anything.” I knew finding true inti-
macy was difficult, so I was patient. Waiting through high 
school, I watched my friends fall in love with the wrong 
people — have sex and call it painful, awkward, or the worst, 
“not as exciting as everyone says it is.” I naively thought it 
would come easily in college. I thought it would help define 
me as I grew older — I equated my patience with maturity, 
rather than fear of disappointment or rejection.

But then college came and with it dark Crystal Palace par-

ties and putting on sexy underwear because we’re in college 
and you never know and guys trying to take my pants off in 
dark corners while I drunkenly laughed and said, “I’m not 
having sex with you.” Though I loved the energy and I never 
stopped myself from having fun, I knew that wasn’t how I 
wanted it to go down. I so desperately wanted to not care, 
wanted to be able to have a one-night stand and wave a big 
flag out my window the next morning saying, “I fucking did 
it everyone!” And to be frank, I knew that as an 18-year-old 

with a vagina, I could get it if I wanted it. Access wasn’t the 
issue. Emotional attachment, mutual respect, and real, gen-
uine attraction were, and still are, the tricky parts.

For a while in high school I entertained the idea of becom-

ing a writer. I agonized, because the advice I got from teach-
ers and other writers was always, “Write what you know.” 
But what did I know, beyond the fictional experiences from 
books and TV that I reveled in? Sure, I was nice. I was smart. 
But I did not feel exciting, nor did I live an exciting life. I 
wasn’t the girl things happened to; I was the best friend or 
the older sister or the daughter or the classmate who was 
there to support, laugh at, or cheer on the people that more 
exciting things did happen to.

“I’ve experienced nothing!” I would cry with ironic melo-

drama. “I know nothing!”

And while I no longer really feel that way — I’ve carved a 

path of experiences, met fascinating people and lived a life 
I’m happy to lead — it’s still a fear I carry today, even though 
I’ve abandoned the idea of becoming the next Jane Austen.

This fear becomes tangled up in all my insecurities and 

inadequacies. Maybe if I was bolder and brasher and braver I 
could meet someone that excited me. Maybe I’m just not that 
interesting, or at least not in an intriguing, sexy way. And 
the most insidious doubt, the one I hate myself for thinking 
but that’s always lurking in the pit of my stomach: maybe if 
I was just a bit prettier, the good guys — the Lloyd Dobblers 
of the world — would start forming a line. I know this type 
of thinking isn’t healthy, and I force myself to self-affirm — 
“You is kind, you is smart, you is important.” — but it’s hard 
to validate myself when I feel like I have grown stagnant, 
still that earnest seventh grader dreaming of the someday.

I know I am kind, and smart, and important, but I can’t 

help think that I crave sex in the same way I crave that elu-
sive “experience.” On some level, I’m afraid if it doesn’t hap-
pen, it means I’m less of a person, that I’m doing something 
wrong.

Wednesday, February 11, 2015 // The Statement

swells from every corner of the caf-
eteria-disco from every teenaged 
body in attendance, his voice rings 
true and sharp.

Eric Stanson is a youth volunteer 

at Ruth Ellis.

“I LOVE THE WAY YOU MOVE 

SO SEXY. LET ME SEE YOU 
POP THAT BOOTY,” he screams 
when Adrian, no longer pirou-
etting or holding up any middle 
fingers, gyrates down the dance 
floor. Stanson bellows his anthem 
throughout the night, directing 
at whoever gathers the requisite 
courage to venture down the cat-
walk. He does it tirelessly. He does 
it relentlessly. He does it homicid-
ally. He heaves his words with the 
weight of a man looking to instill 
the fear of God, to change lives. He 
does it because, in some ways, he 
just may.

Studies by the University of Cali-

fornia, Los Angeles have indicated 
46 percent of LGBTQ homeless 
youth on the streets run away due 
to familial rejection of their sexual 
orientation or gender identifica-
tion. In many cases, the resulting 
self-doubt and invalidation fes-
ters long into adulthood, only to 
materialize in the form of severe 
depression or self harm. One of the 

ball’s most palpable intentions is to 
create a breathable atmosphere of 
affirmation, one that any bystand-
er can feel wash over them, can 
inhale, exhale with fire.

Roman Bertram, a high school 

student who has been visiting 
the Center regularly for the past 
year, nods casually along to Stan-
son’s red-faced chants, not unlike 
a middle-aged Mormon man who 
stumbled into a Marilyn Manson 
concert.

“They couldn’t get me out there 

if they pointed a goddamn flame-
thrower at me,” he says after a beat. 
“I mean, don’t get me wrong — I’m 
glad I’m here, but shit ... like an 
actual flamethrower.”

Bertram leans back when he 

laughs. He lets his head fall back 
so he can really feel the warmth at 
the base of his stomach rise up his 
throat on its way to chortle out in 
a guffaw. He has kind eyes that he 
sometimes winks when he’s in the 
middle of telling a joke, eyebrows 
that rise comically in the tiny 
moments before the man he’s been 
glancing at walks by.

Without any prompt, he talks 

at length about his plans for the 
future.

“I want to major in English,” he 

says, with a period. “I don’t really 
care where I go, but I want to be 
reading when I get there.”

Bertram doesn’t know how he 

will pay for college, acknowledg-
ing his high school years have been 
“kind of a mess.” After being bul-
lied for much of his freshman and 
sophomore year, he began to lose 
interest in schoolwork, followed 
quickly by any hope that things 

could ever change.

“It’s hard to talk about because it 

felt like I had such little control at 
that time. It was a blur,” he says. “It 
was a lot of confusion, then frustra-
tion, then not really caring. I didn’t 
know who I was.”

His eyes turn to granite when 

he talks about the weeks before he 
found Ruth Ellis, scrolling desper-
ately online for some modicum of 
understanding — anyone willing to 
listen. He felt pride in being ready, 
for the first time in his life, to talk. 
The search words he used were 
“gay,” “Detroit” and “help.”

“I try to be here as much as I can, 

usually every day,” he says. “I don’t 
even really have to be doing any-
thing: I can just come and sit down 
and have regular conversations 
with people about literally any-
thing. It started to get better once 
I started coming. I felt like, after a 
really long time, I wanted to get it 
together again. Still, I —”

Bertram’s thoughts are cut short 

by a loud crash reverberating from 
the other end of the cafeteria-disco. 
Two men have fallen face-first into 
a chair while trying to execute a 
complex bodily maneuver involv-
ing a combination of breakdancing 
and tap dancing in sync. More than 
half the room now gapes silently, 
hands splayed over O’d lips. A bal-
loon pops without much aplomb. As 
the downed gentlemen silently rise, 
fragments of their dignity hanging 
around them in ribbon-like tatters, 
the familiar chant starts up again. 
Albeit a little quieter, a little shak-
ier.

“I LOVE THE WAY YOU MOVE 

SO SEXY ... Let me see you pop that 
booty?”

In a weekly meeting of former 

Ruth Ellis youth — those who now 
have stable jobs and housing after 
an extended period of time visiting 
the Center — two attendees go over 
examples of open-ended questions 
as if they were in a high school 
journalism class.

The gatherings, called “Out In 

The System,” are project-oriented, 
and the group — which consists 
of approximately ten members 
in total — is gearing to propose a 
change in the way Detroit’s Child 
Protective 
Services 
interviews 

victims before referring them for 
foster care. On a dry erase board 
hanging in the back, goals like 
“Develop research question” and 
“Develop research sample” have 
been scrawled in black marker by 
Tom Molina-Duarte, the leader-
ship and advocacy coordinator 
guiding the discussion.

The intention is to select a pool 

of viable interview subjects, then 
record them answering a series 
of questions that Molina-Duartes 
hopes will convince CPS to include 
Ruth Ellis in the conversation when 
they speak with kids about leaving 
home or help them better mediate 
the relationship between out youth 
and their respective families. Moli-
na-Duartes talks patiently.

Often, the dialogue wanders and 

the two former Center visitors talk 
openly, casually about their pasts. 
Victor Kalten doesn’t seem per-
turbed when he discusses the night 
he was raped by two men while in 
foster care. Bonnie Dyer is luke-

warm when she mentions how cer-
tain members of her family won’t 
let her communicate with or even 
go near her niece ever since she 
came out as a lesbian.

“I feel like a majority of these 

kids don’t even make it to foster 
care. A lot of them are just out on 
the streets,” Kalten says. “I think 
the numbers they use to calculate 
the percent of homeless people who 
are LGBTQ comes from how many 
there are in foster homes. Which 
doesn’t make sense because there 
are so many who never even make 
it there.”

“Even in foster care,” he says. 

“The fact that you’re LGBT doesn’t 
really get discussed. It’s treated 
like a secret.”

Kalten talks at length about 

the complex disparity between 
admitting to the world that you’re 
gay and the lead-up to the realiza-
tion that you’re not straight. In a 
foster care system where there is 
little dialogue about sexual orien-
tation, Kalten feels this lead up can 
become unnecessarily drawn out, 
even harmful.

“Things changed so much for me 

before I told people I was gay and 
after,” he says. “It felt like I was 
completely unprepared because I 
had never simply been told that it 
was okay to be gay. No one came up 
to me and had a conversation about 
it. One of the things I want out of 
this project is to make sure other 
kids don’t go through the same 
thing.”

The stigma, Dyer adds, forces 

many LGBTQ individuals to con-
stantly question their circum-
stances, often for good reasons, but 
sometimes in ways that can need-
lessly put them at odds with the 
people around them. She referenc-
es experiences with the job market.

“I know a lot of people who have 

been fired from their jobs after 
they’ve been outed,” she explains. 
“And they carry that knowledge 
with them wherever they go to 
work next. It’s the same way when 
you’re a kid and you’re being raised 
to believe straightness is the only 
thing that exists. Without ever 
realizing it, it gets so much harder 
to trust people to accept who you 
are.”

When there isn’t anything else 

to say, Bertram watches the danc-
ing quietly. He doesn’t move when 
Adrian stuffs two large balloons 
into the bust of the dress he pulled 
on two hours ago and two more in 
the back of his underpants. After a 
while, he smiles.

“Flamethrower,” is the only 

word he says before walking away.
