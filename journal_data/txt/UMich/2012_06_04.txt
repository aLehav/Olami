senior class in a different light and
understand their stories and where
they're coming from.
"Not only was it building us
for the season, the main thing
is it developed us as leaders and
improved us as men."
A business trip
A three-day trip to California
sounds more like a vacation than
anything else. The players, though,
can assure you it was anything but.
Michigan officials told ESPN
that the Big Ten had cleared the trip
because of its benefits in develop-
ing leadership and life skills, which
under NCAA rules is permissible.
The trip was funded through a spe-
cial fund in the Michigan Athletic
Department's operatingbudget.
With one quick look at the itiner-
ary, the seniors of Michigan's Team
133 knew one thing for certain:
"That this was a business trip,"
Kovacs said. "And that's exactly
what it was."
Michigan strength and con-
ditioning coach Aaron Wellman
joined the seniors for the extent
of the trip, with head coach Brady
Hoke stopping in briefly on the sec-
ond day.
There were several senior-only
meetings in which players aired
their shortcomings, goals and frus-
trations. The focus was on three
questions:
"Ho hav ou devloe ds a

leader so far?"
"How have you developed as a
man?"
"What do you still need to
improve on?"
"A lot of us said, 'You know, we've
taken baby steps but we're still
nowhere near where we want to be
as leaders on this team,' " Kovacs
said.

for the senior class. You saw guys
start to connect a bit - guys who
are from completely different back-
grounds but realized (they) had a
common story," Kovacs said.
Smelling roses for the first
time
On Thursday morning, the

player but how you carry yourself as
a person as well."
With the benefit having played
EA Sports' NCAA Football video
game, the youngsters correctly
identified a handful of Michigan
players.
Denard Robinson?
"Oh yeah, well that's pretty easy,"
Kovacs said.

He added: "We've been together
for four years en we know each
other pretty well, but there were
some stories that will stay in the
room that made me feel like I didn't
know my teammates half as well as
I thought I did."
But that's all part of the process
of building a senior class.

seniors boarded abus and began the
hour-long trip to Pasedena to visit
the Rose Bowl.
It was an opportunity to visual-
ize for a team that hasn't reached
the Rose Bowl since 2007.
"It was my first time and I was
dying to see it," Kovacs said. "That's
a special place. I understand now
why they call it the granddaddy of
'em all."
The team took a tour of the locker
rooms and stepped inside the bowl
to snap pictures.
"It was unreal," Kovacs said. "I
left that place thinking, 'I've gotta
be back here in six more months,
because I can't go too long away
from this place.
"We've had this vision of playing
in the Rose Bowl, but this gave us a
picture, something tangible to see
to make that vision even clearer."
The group went to a nearby park
to conduct the youth coaches camp,
splitting up into position groups
and rotating the kids through.
"Anytime that you get an oppor-
tunity to work with kids, you under-
stand that it's something they're
going to remember for their life-
time," Kovacs said. "It's an opportu-
nity that you have to send a message
to them and get to work with them
to not only develop them as football
playersbut also as human beings.
"They're not just watching or lis-
tening to what you say as a football

Big Will?
"He got dog-piled."
Any surprises?
"The kids said, 'Vince Smith ... is
that No. 2? Is that the running back?
Aw, he's good."' Kovacs said with a
laugh. "It was really funny."
Training with the SEALs
On Friday, the seniors earned a
trip to the beach in Coronado. But it
was no picnic.
That's because this beach was
at the Naval Amphibious Base just
outside San Diego. The Wolverines
were there to meet Rob Stella, the
SEALs' chief special warfare opera-
tor, who ran their workout.
Stella summed up the workout
by explaining a common military
motto: Embrace the suck.
That suck was brought on by
three hours of log carries, sit-ups,
push-ups and grueling team-build-
ing exercises.
The seniors were then split up
into teams to create a competition
atmosphere and Stella would give
orders to one person from each
team. They would sprint back to
explain the drill to their team. The
first team to finish wins.
"At timeswe were doing thecom-
plete wrong thing and obviously
that's where communication was a
little broken down," Kovacs said.
The workout emphasized con-

cepts the coaches drill everyday:
accountability, toughness and per-
severance even through a rough set.
"You were only as strong as your
weakest link, really," Kovacs said.
"That really hit me during that trip
because I might be cranking out my
15 pushups but if my partner isn't
doing it, then we're going to start
right over."
He laughed.
"And we did that a lot, I can
promise you that. If the guy next to
me isn't carrying the log, I'm going
to be feelingthe brunt of it.
There were highs and lows. Some
teammates yelled, others helped.
The trip was designed that way.
"We showed our true colors in
the SEALs workout, whether we
liked it or not - a snapshot of who
we are," Kovacs said. "Some of it
wasn't pretty, but some of it was."
The seniors finished drenched
in sweat and covered in sand. They
posed for a team picture on the
beach and then collapsed once they
got back on the bus.
"It wasn't the most relaxing trip
to the beach, but it might have been
the most rewarding," Kovacs said.
"We slept good that night, I
promise you that."
Hoke, whose relationship with
the SEALs is well-documented,
has worked closely with them as
head coach at San Diego State, and
he had three SEALs visit before the
Nebraska game on Nov. 19.
The SEALs gave three tridents to
the team, which stay with the team
to this day.
Last week, with the seniors visit-
ing just days before Memorial Day,
the Wolverines were quick to point
out that they aren't comparing foot-
ball to what the SEALs do.
"Coach Wellman the first night
told us, 'What we do is nothing is
nothing compared to what they do,'
" Kovacs said. "If they go out there
and lose, they lose men. If we lose,
we just lose a game and we've got to
come back on Sunday and get those
corrections.
"But there are some parallels
with the training, as there are with
many team sports, and we learned
how to control ourselves when
we're not comfortable, how to stay
mentally strong and how to over-
come adversity and how to commu-
nicate better."
Now a week removed from the
trip, Kovacs said it has already paid
dividends. The seniors met this
week to set goals and benchmarks
for their final season at Michigan.
"This senior group is tighter than
any group I've ever been a part of,
and I'm excited to see how far we
can take it," Kovacs said.

Higher

Budget passed in
state House, awaits
vote in state Senate
By ANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
On Friday, the state House of
Representatives approved a $1.4
billion higher education budget,
ending weeks of disagreement
about how to distribute $36 mil-
lion in additional higher education
funding.
The budget plan, which is
expected to be passed by the state
Senate and signed next week,
outlines a 1.6 percent increase in
funding for the University. The
increases under the plan would
be tied to performance metrics
such as holding tuition hikes
below 4 percent per year, offer-
ing degrees in "critical skill areas"
and reporting on embryonic stem
cell research - with the Universi-
ty being the only public university
in the state to conduct such work.
University officials, including
Cynthia Wilbanks and President
Mary Sue Coleman, as well as state
lawmakers have clashed over per-
formance metrics in the months
since Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der introduced his budget for the
2012-13 fiscal year on Feb. 9.
In testimony to a House sub-
committee in March, Coleman
said she would prefer the Carne-

But noticeably absent from the
conference were state lawmakers
who stayed in Lansing to wrap
up the state budget by the June 1
deadline Snyder imposed. One of
the major sticking points that the
Michigan Legislature was work-
ing to iron out was the state's high-
er education appropriation.

HIGHER ED.
From Page 1A
passed its version of the budget
Friday, allocating $1.4 billion to
the state's 15 public universities,
including an additional $36 million
that will be distributed based on
the Carnegie Classification, a com-
prehensive system of metrics that
measures the universities' perfor-
mance. .
The metrics included in the
House bill are different than those
initially proposed by Snyder. In an
interview Wednesday, before the
House passed its budget, Repub-
lican Lt. Gov. Brian Calley said
the first allocation formula, which
would reward schools for things
such as low tuition costs and a high
graduation rate, allowed the state
to incentivize the schools in order
to help the economy.
"We're trying to ... take the
growing resources that we have
today - it's great to be in a posi-
tion where we can make strategic
investments - and use it to encour-
age the sorts of things that we need

to happen in order to meet all the
demands of the economy today,"
Calley said.
Numerous speakers from
throughout the conference pointed
out that Michigan needs more col-
lege graduates of all kinds - two-
year degrees, four-year degrees
and advanced degrees - to fill the
80,000 jobs Snyder referenced.
However, higher education lead-
ers attheconferencenotedthatthey
were already making contributions
to the economy. On Wednesday,
the University Research Corridor
released a study that reported the
three URC schools - the Univer-
sity of Michigan, Michigan State
University and Wayne State Uni-
versity - have graduated 3,600
students who took jobs in the auto
industry over the past five years.
Coleman said the number of stu-
dents the universities graduated,
along with the more than $300
million in auto-related research at
the universities, show how impor-
tant the schools are to the state's
economy.
"Even though the auto industry
is changing dramatically, it's still a

very important part of the Michi-
gan economy, and the innovation
in the auto industry is something
that fits very well with the research
agendas of the universities," Cole-
man said.
Stephen Forrest, the Univer-
sity's vice president for research
who also attended the conference,
said the auto-related research and
graduates coming from the URC
schools could help create a Silicon
Valley-like atmosphere in south-
east Michigan surrounding the
auto industry.
Forrest added that he hoped his
time in Mackinac would allow the
University to make additional con-
nections in the business world soit
can continue to commercialize its
research findings.
"Some of the talks have been
fascinating to get a sense of where
Michigan industry and the econo-
my are rightnow, and this is crucial
for the University of Michigan's
planning and research sphere ...
because we're engaged with them;
we need to know where they're
going," Forrest said.
Forrest added that he found
old and the eldest was in his 70s.
Burton added that she was glad to
watch the climbers and said she
even intended to help a quadrilat-
eral amputee who is missing all
four of her limbs climb the rock
wall.
"Watching participants cheer
for each other and providing
encouragement always gives me
teary eyes," Burton said.
Nora Rosenblum, a UMHS
social worker who works with
U-CAN and helped organize the
event, said in the past she has been
active in programs in the amputee
community and part of her role
includes co-facilitating the sup-
port network.
"My involvement with U-CAN
is not only a job for me, but also a
passion," Rosenblum said.
Rosenblum added that she wit-
nessed many participants undergo
transformations of self-awareness
throughout the event.
"For many, there has been a
huge change," Rosenblum said.
"One of our younger participants
wasn't sure if he wanted to rock

the conference useful because
it brought together all the vari-
ous aspects of the University and
allowed leaders to analyze its
impact on the state.
"The University of Michigan is
a very public-spirited institution,
and we're very woven into the fab-
ric of the state - that's research,
that's education and that's health-
care - and they all come together
at this conference," he said.
Similarly, Douglas Strong, CEO
of the University's Hospitals and
Health Centers, also attended
the conference and explained in
an interview with The Michigan
Daily that the conference helps
him stay up-to-date on happen-
ings in the health community and
how health care costs are affecting
other businesses.
"I come here, and I meet hospi-
tal people from around the state,"
Strong said. "It's part of impor-
tant networking, and it's also
important to participate in hear-
ing what other businesses are
saying about the impact of health
care costs about what they're

Douglas Edmonson, a health
sciences student at Oakland Uni-
versity, got out of his wheelchair to
climb a 50-foot wall.
"Every step gives me a sense
of accomplishment," Edmonson
said. "I had my doubts before
coming here today and I was
nervous to begin with, but my
experience has shattered my
doubts."
Jake Steinhebel, a 10th-grade
student at Pinckney High School,
is a patient at C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital who underwent a leg
amputation. Steinhebel participat-
ed in both the rock climbing and
golf activities.
He said his first time climb-
ing was one to remember, adding
that he felt uneasy near the top
even though he was confident at
the start.
"I never rock climbed before,
but I did it today and climbed at
least 45 feet off the ground," Stein-
hebel said. "I also made many
great connections today with the
other participants."

Wouldn't everyone like to be
Justin Verlander's agent?
If your name is Mark Pieper,
you're living the dream.
Pieper, who graduated from
Michigan with a degree in econom-
ics and a law degree from North-
western, is a part owner of the
agency SFX Baseball, one of the
largest in the industry.
The Michigan Daily caught up
with the alum and talked about
baseball, representing Detroit
Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander and
Michigan football.
The Michigan Daily: What
made you want to come to Michi-
gan?
Mark Pieper: Ironically, I wish
I had some amazing story about
how I always wanted to come to
Michigan. It was complete chance
I was there. One of the kids I
went to junior high with applied
there, and I went to high school
where not a lot of kids were going
to that caliber of school. So I kind
of reconnected with this kid and
he was really excited about it and
he basically said, "Hey, you should
apply to Michigan and be my room-
mate" and I said OK. That's how it
went. It wasn't that sophisticated.
My parents didn't go to college, my
oldest brother didn't go to college,
my other brother went to a smaller
Division III, so there wasn't a lot of
guidance or a long family history.
But I met my wife there as a fresh-
man and her parents both went to

Michigan, so there's some family
connection there.
TMD: What made you want to
become an agent?
MP: A long history of being
interested in sports, combined with
an interest in law kind of sparked
my interest at the very beginning.
As I said, I met my wife when I was
at Michigan and her father was a
longtime baseball agent, and I pret-
ty much learned everything I know
from him. He went to Michigan and
played baseball at Michigan, too.
TMD: You said you wanted to be
a football agent, what made you get
into baseball?
MP: Baseball was introduced
to me by my father in law because
that's all he did. I think it was a bet-
ter fit because baseball has some-
thing called salary arbitration and
basically it's'a legal process where
you represent a player through this
process and write briefs and pres-
ent a case orally. That kind of fit
my need to do a little practicing of
law. It was kind of a good fit for me
to transition into baseball and use
some of the legal skills right away
in writing and arguing arbitration
cases.
TMD: And obviously you're still
in the baseball field.
MP: Yep, that's all I do is base-
ball. Our firm, which is called SFX
Baseball, all we do is baseball. We
grew from a two-person firm in the
1970s, and now we have around 28
or 29 employees.
TMD: What athletes do you rep-
resent?
MP: Our firm has Mariano Rive-

Michigan alum and MLB agent talks
Justin Verlander, Michigan football

ra, Justin Verlander, David Ortiz,
Alfonzo Soriano, Justin Morneau,
Jim Thome - that's a pretty good
mix. We have about 70 guys total.
TMD: Are there any clients that
playedbaseball at Michigan?
MP: Yes. Chris Getz. Royals sec-
ond baseman.
TMD: How did you get in con-
tact with him? Did you watch him
play in Ann Arbor?
MP: Actually he's a guy I got
later on. He was playing for the Chi-
cago White Sox and we had a client
on the White Sox named Gordon
Beckham and they were friends,
and I met Chris that way. So he
hired me after he already left Mich-
igan and developed a pro career.
But we had Zach Putnam, and Zach
was out of Michigan, and one of our
agents lives in Ann Arbor. He has a
lot of connections there, so he lives
and works out of Ann Arbor.
TMD: Take me step-by-step
through your job through the sea-
son.
MP: Being an agent years ago,
(it was) primarily negotiating con-
tracts. We started adding tax peo-
ple and marketing, (and) slowly but
surely it has become what it is now,
which is full-service. We have a tax
department, financial department,
legal department, public relations
(and) charity. We can be involved
with anything and everything.
TMD: So during the season, are
you in contact with the players a
lot?
MP: All the time. During the
season, I probably talk to my clients
every few days, maybe I go a week

at most without talking to them,
but with texting, I think I'm in con-
stant contact with them.
TMD: I couldn't imagine the life
of a professional baseball player,
with 162 games and PR and Twitter
and such.
MP: I think the most challeng-
ing thing, and that most people
don't realize, is people on the out-
side think they have a 7:00 p.m.
game and roll in at the field at 5:30
p.m. But they're at the field at like
1:30 p.m. or 2:00 p.m. The game
lasts until at least 10:00 p.m., they
have to shower and eat after the
game, and they don't get to bed
until very late, so they have to sleep
in a little bit. So they only have a
very small window of time that is
available every day. Everything else
is baseball. There's not a lot of free
time - all their free time is at the
ballpark.
TMD: Do you get to go to games
often? Any just for fun?
MP: I go to games all the time. I
started keeping track of the amount
of games I go to over the course of
the year. From the start of this sea-
son, I've been to 33 games, but the
only games I go for fun are my son's.
Not that I don't have fun at the
games, but they're all work related.
TMD: What clients do you rep-
resent specifically?
MP: Justin Morneau of the
Twins, Justin Verlander - I work
with another agent with Verlander
- Chris Getz, Juan Pierre of the
Phillies, Erik Bedard and Garrett
Jones of the Pirates, Koji Uehara,
who's a reliever on the Rangers,

Jordan Zimmerman and Tom Gor-
zelanny, who are pitchers on the
Nationals, Brian Roberts of the Ori-
oles. All great guys.
TMD: Tell me a little bit about
Justin Verlander. What's it like rep-
resenting him?
MP: He has become such an
elite pitcher. He is so dominant in
what he does. Every start is such
pleasure to watch because he has
a chance to pitch a no-hitter every
game - that's how good his stuff is.
But what comes with that is a tre-
mendous amount of off-the-field
stuff. There's a whole team of peo-
ple. There are (two other guys) who
deal with the day-to-day requests
to be on shows, to do commercials
or ads. When you have success,
that's what comes with it. You have
to pick and choose which ones you
want to do and make sure you don't
do too much and neglect your base-
ball and family obligations.
TMD: Are there any Michigan
connections between you and Chris
Getz?
MP: There isn't too much of a
connection there in terms of "Oh,
we were in the same fraternity"
or anything like that. I think the
bond over Michigan (and) just the
general pride of having both gone
there, but there's certainly still the
connection in the football world
and rooting for Michigan football.
When you went to Michigan and
you meet another person who went
to Michigan, it's just a matter of
minutes before Michigan football
comes up. So we have that bond
together.

M' seniors show true colors in leadership trip

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Twenty-two members from the
Michigan football travelled to New-
port Beach, Calif. last week for a
three-day senior leadership trip.
They saw, heard and experienced
plenty of things they never expect-
ed.
There were closed-door senior
meetings. There was a brutal three-
hour workout with Navy SEALs in
Coronado, Calif. There was a visit to

the Rose Bowl.
And there was Big Will.
Fifth-year senior safety Jordan
Kovacs can't describe the scene
without laughing. The seniors were
conducting a youth football clinic in
Pasedena, Calif
Kovacs remembers turningto see
6-foot-5, 322-pound lineman Will
Campbell bolting down the football
field with 35 kids in tow.
"I was thinking, 'How is he
gonna get away from all these kids?'
" Kovacs said.

Well, he didn't. One of the young-

'U' to develop sporting
event loytprogram

By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Editor
Now that the Michigan softball
team's season is over, it's time to
take a look back and mention some
highlights of the year.
BEST WIN: May 20, 4-0 over
Louisville.
It may be easy to call the Wol-
verines' NCAA Regional-winning
victory their best win of the season,
but take a look at the box score and
you'll see why.
For starters, Michigan's pitching
was dominating. Freshman lefty
Haylie Wagner - who had already
pitched two complete games in the
Regional - made it three consecu-
tive starts in the circle in the May
20 game against the Cardinals.
Wagner went the full six innings,
giving up six hits, no earned runs
and walked just one batter. The
Orange, Calif. native also picked up
her 32nd win of the season, pushing
her past former ace Jordan Taylor
for the most wins by a freshman in
a season.
The Wolverines' offense was also
stellar in the victory over the Car-
dinals, scoring their four runs on
eight hits and drawing five walks.
Seniors Bree Evans and Amanda
Chidester both went 2-for-3 on the
day, and junior Ashley Lane con-
tributed two RBIs.
But the reason behind their suc-
cess was what Michigan coach
Carol Hutchins calls "one-pitch

softball." Hutchins has been
preaching patience at the plate and
playing one-pitch softball - both
at bat and in the circle - all season,
and she finally saw a well-rounded
game by her team in the Regional
championship game.
"I thought our kids were brilliant
in one area in particular, and it was
one-pitch softball," Hutchins said
after the May 20 win. "We harped
on that all day. We told them before
the game, don't worry about wheth-
er we get (a win), just worry about
one pitch."
WORST LOSS: April 11, 1-0 to
Western Michigan.
The Wolverines were in the
midst of a 5-1 start to Big Ten play
when they played the midweek
game against the Broncos.
The squad was used to blowing
through its conference schedule
and taking down weaker noncon-
ference opponents, so it figured its
game against Western Michigan
would be a breeze.
But with a stalling offense,
Hutchins was not pleased with
what she saw that Wednesday eve-
ning.
"They just thought they were
going to walk in here and show up
because they have Michigan on
their chest," Hutchins said after
the April 11 loss. "We got what we
deserved."
The game against the Broncos
was a wake-up call for the Wolver-
ines, pointing out to the squad that

they were not invincible and they
would have to work hard and come
prepared to play for each and every
game the rest of the season.
TURNING POINT: May 1, 4-2
over Eastern Michigan.
After faltering a bit in confer-
ence play - Michigan lost four of
six Big Ten games to Minnesota
and Illinois - the squad rallied in
extra innings to beat the Eagles and
began an offensive hot streak for
the team.
Freshman Sara Driesenga hit a
walk-off, two-run home run in the
bottom of the ninth inning to cap
the 4-2 victory over Eastern Michi-
gan. Six Wolverines recorded a hit,
and the win launched an eight-
game win streak for the squad, right
when the team needed it the most.
"We just decided May 1 we start
over," Hutchins said after the victo-
ry. "Reboot. It doesn't matter what
we've done in the past."
Michigan would go on to sweep
Wisconsin and Purdue, clinching
its fifth-consecutive Big Ten title,
and win the Louisville Regional in
the NCAA Tournament.
SILVER SLUGGER(S): Amanda
Chidester and Driesenga.
The senior first baseman and the
freshman designated player both
had outstanding years at the plate.
Chidester led the team in bat-
ting average (.347), runs scored (37),
doubles (12), RBIs (46) and slugging
percentage (.597) and was named
the Big Ten's Player of the Year,
making her the Wolverines' most
potent power hitter.
The Allen Park, Mich. native had
a 25-game on-base streak in the
heart of the season, and became
one of two Wolverines to break the
200 RBI mark when she hit a home
run against Alabama in the NCAA
Super Regional.
But Driesenga was the Wolver-
ines' offensive weapon for most of
conference and post-season play.
The freshman was slotted as the
desginated player in the March 21
matchup against Eastern Michi-
gan, and with a two-run homer that
game, she found herself a perma-
nent spot in the lineup.
After that game, Driesenga
improved her batting average to
.340, good for second-best on the
team, and proved that pitchers
can be offensive weapons, too. Her
34-game on-base streak was the
longest by a Wolverine all season
and hit the walk-off double against
Kentucky to begin NCAA Regional
play.

GOLDEN GLOVE: Stephanie
Kirkpatrick.
After being rotated around the
infield for much of the nonconfer-
ence schedule, Kirkpatrick found
her home at third base. Though the
senior may not have had the perfect
season, she came through when the
team needed her most.
In the NCAA Regional, Kirkpat-
rick had a few nice snags in the hot
corner, preventing some hard-hit
balls from turning into singles and
potential runs.
"Tremendous defense from
(Michigan)," said Louisville coach
Sandy Pearsall after the May'20
matchup. "They made some very,
very tough plays. Some of those hits
would've gone through (and) fallen
in. The third basemin, diving off
the backhand - great play."
Kirkpatrick's stellar defense in
the three Regional games helped
the Wolverines advance to the
NCAA Super Regional and was
some of the best softball played in
the hot corner in Michigan's post-
season run.
ROOKIE OF THE YEAR: Hay-
lie Wagner.
Hands down the easiest pick.
Though there were only four fresh-
men on the team - catchers Becca
Garfinkel and Lauren Sweet, and
pitchers Driesenga and Wagner -
the left-hander had the best season
by far.
Wagner set the Michigan soft-
ball program record for most fresh-

man wins (32), was named Big Ten
Freshman and Pitcher of the Year,
and led the conference in wins and
earned run average at the end of the
regular season.
The Orange, Calif. native earned
all three Regional victories for the
Wolverines, where she pitched
three complete games and gave up
just three runs, and pitched both
games (and losses) against Alabama
in the NCAA Super Regional.
Simply put, Wagner was the ace
in the circle for Michigan this sea-
son.
MVP: Wagner again.
For the same reasons Wagner is
Michigan's Rookie of the Year, the
freshman is also the team's Most
Valuable Player.
The left-handed hurler put up
absurdly good numbers for a fresh-
man - numbers comparable to Jor-
dan Taylor's freshman year. Now,
Taylor is a member of USA Softball
- something Wagner could be a
part of if she continues her success.
Though the Wolverines had
another rookie in the circle - right-
hander Driesenga - it was Wagner
who dominated. And though you
could make a case for Chidester to
be MVP, Michigan's offense wasn't
consistent throughout the season
and Chidester's year wasn't as good
as previous seasons. In addition,
pitching was reliable in most games
and often times the Wolverines
would have to ride Wagner's arm in
order to win tight games.

But Sedlecky said such a pro-

"(Maize Rage) has a list of tun-
nel access for just a very small
number of our people, so we get

open to the public," he said. "And
once the doors open it's general

Sedlecky added that he thinks
the policy used for most basket-
ball games is unfair to the more
dedicated fans.
"It's not fair to those people
that have been to every single
game and are the best fans and
the loudest fan ... maybe they
have an exam or something
and can only get there an hour
beforehand and are stuck in the
upper deck," he said.
Sedlecky added that he hopes
to see the Athletic Department
institute a loyalty program for all
sports, also pointing out students
who show up late to football
games as a reason a loyalty pro-
gram would be useful.
"The student section might be
halfway full by midway through
the first quarter (or) even at the
end of the first quarter," Sedlecky
said. "Generally it's not all the
way filled up until maybe mid-
second quarter - it's somewhat
embarrassing."
University alum Jeff Hol-
zhausen, the founder of Maize
Rage and the original "Super-
fan," said student involvement
is dependent on the talent of the
team, adding that he understands
not every game will be exciting,
but he thinks it is important for
students to show support at all
games.
"There's going to be games
that just don't generate as much
excitement, but part of being
a student is just the game-day
experience," Holzhausen said.
Holzhausen said he thinks
the Michigan athletic tradi-
tion should be enough to keep
students attending games, but
rewarding students couldn't
hurt.
"I don't think students should
need a kick in the ass, but if the
athletic department can think of
creative ideas to get people there
early, have at it."

s the University's 2012 graduating class prepares for life after
graduation, many of them will leave Michigan. This eagerness
to get out of the state altogether often stems from the fear that
our state has nothing to offer college graduates. Many students don't
see the state of Michigan beyond the confines of Ann Arbor despite the
fact that Detroit, one of America's most historic and important cities, is
only a short drive away. The state of Michigan needs to prioritize the
proposal that Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) made for commuter rail
services between Detroit and Ann Arbor to unite the two cities and spur

It was the last case of the day:
an overweight woman requiring
an open abdominal cholecystec-
tomy - gall bladder removal. Four
hours later, I walked out of the
medical clinic in Chocola, Guate-
mala to return for dinner. A man
approached me, grabbed my hands
and repeated the words "thank
you" several times. His wife was
the woman we had just moved to
post-op. Little did he know, I was
merely a freshman in college and
had only shadowed the surgeon.
Regardless of whether I deserved
the gratitude or not, it was that
moment that made me realize why
I was in Guatemala.
I initially decided to partici-
pate in the medical mission trip to
Guatemala to determine if I actu-
ally wanted to be a doctor and, to
be honest, because I knew it would
look good on my medical school
application. What I learned, how-
ever, in that first short week in Gua-
temala far surpassed anythingI had
learned from my previous classes at
the University of Michigan.
Immersed in the culture of tradi-
tional Mayans, I realized that at its
core, medicine is the same regard-
less of where you are in the world.
At the same time, it's different with
respect to individual culture and
the way in which medical condi-
tions are perceived. Even with the
diversity that Ann Arbor offers,
this was not somethingI could have
learned while sitting in the Natural
Science Building listening to lec-
tures about neurons.
As a pre-health student, I was
extremely lucky to have the chance
to travel to Guatemala and experi-
ence a culture other than my own.
Many students, though, do not have
this opportunity between jobs and
summer classes. However, a week
was not nearly enough. I quickly
recognized the potential for what
could have been learned if I had a
few more weeks or even months.
Pre-health students are set in a
rigid schedule, which often requires .
taking more than one science class
each semester. Ifyouwanttogradu-
ate in four years, the opportunity to
study abroad for longer than a week
is largely unavailable because of the
demanding process of applying to
medical school. Though the major-
ity of pre-health students are part
of LSA, and thus included in the

respective standards of a liberal
arts education, the University does
not provide a sufficient number of
programs for pre-health students to
study abroad.
ManySpanishconcentratorswho
have studied abroad in Spain were
able to take classes with a Univer-
sity professor overseas and obtain
grades for Spanish credit. A similar
program with science professors
from the University could be imple-
mented in countries around the
world to allow pre-health students
to fulfill the necessary require-
ments for admission to medical
schools while also experiencingthe
culture of another country.
The Association of American
Medical Colleges has realized this
necessary transition in the prepa-
ration of medical students. While
a solid background in the natural
sciences will always be required for
success in medical school, a greater
emphasis is now being placed on
behavioral and social sciences, as
exemplified in the revised Medical
Colleges Admission Test for 2015.
While generalized studies in
behavior and social sciences are
offered throughthe humanities and
social science distribution in LSA,
pre-health students are limited
in what they can learn, especially
when it comes to experiencing
another culture. By experiencing
the medical field in a culture other
than your own, you are not only
given the opportunity to learn
about another culture, but to appre-
ciate yours as well.
The man who repeated the words
"thank you" to me later explained
that he did not know how much
longer his wife would have. been
able to care for their children with-
out this surgery. He claimed that I
had helped to give his wife a sec-
ond chance at life. These are the
moments that more students should
be able to experience with the help
of the University. As University of
Michigan students, we are sup-
posed to graduate as well-rounded
individuals. However, the Univer-
sity does not currently offer long-
term pre-health programs suited to
the needs of developing well-round-
ed students. What we need to be
successful in our careers cannot be
learned entirely-within the confines
of white classroomwalls.

valuable interaction.
At the 2012 Mackinac Policy
Conference, Sen. Debbie Staben-
ow discussed her proposal to cre-
ate a commuter rail service from
Ann Arbor to the Detroit Metro
Airport and downtown Detroit.
She argued, "Michigan is in dire
need of a transportation and
infrastructure overhaul." Staben-
ow's plan to build a commuter rail
service from Ann Arbor to Detroit
has been discussed in Congress
for some time now, but according
to Stabenow, "That's moving along
slower than I would like." Staben-
ow's challengers to her Senate seaf
argue that this proposal would
need significant private backing
for it to come to fruition.
Ann Arbor has a major short-
age of available parking, so many
students don't have the option of
bringing their cars to campus.
Some students don't have any
form of motorized transportation
and find themselves limited to
Ann Arbor, despite Detroit being a

short 45 minutes away. Lawmak-
ers need to understand that there
are numerous benefits for stu-
dents who visit Detroit.
Detroit is a vibrant and cultur-
ally rich city, but the shadow of
the recession makes many stu-
dents unwilling to visit. Com-
erica Park, Ford Field and Joe
Louis Arena ignite with activity,
on game nights and young artists
who moved to Detroit because of
its exceptionally low cost of liv-
ing have breathed new life into
the city, giving it an entirely new
identity. The University has taken
a step in the right direction with
its Semester in Detroit program.
However, our school can't solely
bear the burden of sending people
to Detroit.
Detroit has many new business
opportunities to benefit students.
At the Mackinac Policy Confer-
ence, Republican Gov. Rick Sny-
der announced the launch of five
new business programs to pro-

mote the growth of businesses
in Michigan. Companies such as
Huntington National Bank, Fifth
Third Bank, DTE Energy and
'Consumers Energy have paved
the way in this initiative. Quicken
Loans, the mortgage company
founded by' Detroit native Dan
Gilbert, recently hired 500 col-
lege students to work as interns at
their office in Detroit, along with
300 new technology employees.
With the unemployment rate
rising to 8.2 percent last month,
graduating students should
be given every opportunity to
explore these job options with-
out public transportation holding
them back.
Detroit is a city that has had so
much taken from it by the reces-'
sion, and it's time for the state of
Michigan and the students of the
-University to increase the amount
they give back. A commuter rail
service that is affordable and easy
to access is the solution.

Henry Award, a Hopwood Award
and Platsis Prize for Work in the
Greek Legacy, Natalie Bakopoulos
grewup listeningto the melody and
music of Greek culture. Holding an
MFA in Fiction from the Universi-
ty, Bakopoulos travels through the
precarious and often unpredictable
world of occupied Greece in her
debut novel "The Green Shore."
"The idea of Greece was always
there," Bakopoulos said in an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily.
"Even if I wasn't speaking Greek as
a child, I heard it when my father
spoke, andI was aware of the ideas
and music ... and of parts of the
Greek culture very acutely."
Bakopoulos said she strayed
from her passion for writing early
on. Despite her love for literature,
Bakopolous graduated with an
undergraduate science degree and
set out to work in a research lab.
"I wanted to be a writer long
before I admitted (it) to myself."
Bakopolous said. "When I found
myself working in a lab, instead
of reading journals like 'Cell' or
'Nature' I would always have The
New Yorker or a literary journal,
and I kept thinking, 'it's nice to be
interested in literature,' but mine
moved beyond just an interest in.
reading."
It was only after a year of sitting
in on a multitude of literature and

writing classes that Bakopolous
admitted to herself that the science
track was not for her. Despite the
belated start on her writing career,
Bakopolous said some of the best
advice she'd received was from a
University professor who spoke
about never fearing the timing of
things.
"Charles Baxter said in a Hop-
wood Talk that 'art is not a sack
race', 'literature is not a sack race,'
and not everyone comes to some-
thing at the same time," she said.
"I think I always felt behind, like
everyone is already publishing
and everyone has their MFAs and
everyone is 'in the business,' so to
speak."
Determined not to let her late
arrival to the writing world hold her
back, Bakopolous started writing
what she knew, recounting old sto-
ries and discovering forgotten his-
tories. This love for Greek culture
propelled Bakopoulos to write "The
Green Shore," and it wasn't until
she began researching the coun-
try's rich history that she began to
understand the difficult position
the coup d'etat had left Greece in.
"It was the idea that Greece
had a military dictatorship dur-
ing a time where the rest of the
world was really moving ahead,"
Bakopoulos said of her interest in
the time period. "Greece was com-
pletely stunted by this coup when
it could have been entering the
modern era."
The trapped environment of
occupied Greece provided an,
entangled backdrop for the char-
acters in the novel. Based loosely
on her father's family, "The Green
Shore" follows the story of four
characters living in Athens at the
time: Sophie, a willful girl with a
penchant for activism thanks to her
left-leaning boyfriend, Nick; Anna,
Sophie's sister, who falls desper-
ately in young love with an older,
married man; Eleni, their widowed
mother, who tries to scramble
together the pieces of her family,
and Sophie and Anna's uncle Miha-
lis, a poet who must lay low due to
his outspoken nature.
"The way the characters feel
trapped makes for a great story,"
Bakopoulos said. "And what better
wayto trap themthan in adictator-
ship."
Bakopoulos also noted that some
characters have more of a real-life
model than others.

"Mihalis was inspired by my
father's uncle who was a poet
named Mihalis Katsaros, and he's a
poet who is known in most circles
of that generation," Bakopoulos
said. "Even if people were not liter-
ary, they'd know him as the crazy
poet in the middle of the square."
The compilation of fictional
characters in a historical setting
allowed Bakopoulos to delve. into
an intricate narrative while having
a general story arc to follow. Bako-
poulos stressed the importance of
the storytelling above the history
lesson the book holds.
"I want my readers to be moved
and to feel differently when they're
finished reading than they felt
when they started," Bakopoulos
said. "If they learn something about
Greek history along the way that's
fantastic, but that's not necessar-
ily my agenda; I wanted to create a
moving narrative that was interest-
ing and complicated."
Taken as an excerpt from Kos-
tas Karyotakis's poem "Sleep," the.
Green Shore symbolizes the need
for something lost, a missing per-
son,placeorsentiment. Encompass-
ing the horrific history of Athens in
the late'60s and the fragile lives of a
family, "The Green Shore" provides
a glimpse into the psyche of charac-
ters cornered anda nation besieged.
"In many ways each character
is longing for something they've
lost, whether that's home or a love
or a different lifestyle, but they're
all longing for that green shore,"
Bakopoulos said. "It's going back
to a place that exists in your mem-
ory."

by sipping his first glass of wine
... and then later throwing back
two bottles' worth and spewing
a drunken, naked, long-awaited
proclamation of love for Laurie

The B-plot of "My Life" almost
forces a farewell to the cul-de-
sac crew's favorite game Penny
Can, which Travis points out has
become boring in its simplicity.
It's a wonderfully theta moment;
after all, how long can an audi-
ence be entertained by watching
characters throw pennies into a
can before the inside joke rusts
over? Travis' dramatic conclusion
- that Penny Can is about family,
tradition, maybe even America -
speaks to the reason we can never
tire of the game. Penny Can's
simple, it's fun, it's resourceful
and it has heart. We love the game
because the characters do, and the
characters are what make "Cougar

witty jokes doused in no-no juice.

"Cougar Town" made it much
more, establishing Wade (Edwin
Hodge) as an actual character. It's
just crazy enough to work, and
when he finally showsup in person
as Travis and Laurie are sharing a
near-moment, Travis' devastation
mixed with Laurie's deserved hap-
piness makes for enough emotion
to fill Big Lou to the brim. The
will-they-won't-theytale of Laurie
and Travis is growing tired, and
some find the age difference tough
to swallow, but it's still hard not
to root for these two as they gaze
at each other during Grayson and
Jules' beach wedding.
Live on, Penny
Can, live on.
That beach wedding. What a
perfect example of a picture-per-
fect romantic scene that "Cougar
Town" does so well without dip-
ping into the overly syrupy. The
trick is infusing the bliss with
zany jokes; Chick (Ken Jenkins) -
fighting tears by looking into his
horse's eyes, the wedding party
having to move along the beach to
avoid oceanside cops.
Setting part of the finale in
Napa evokes the brilliance of sea-
son two's Hawaii-based finale; it's
almost spiritual to see the crew in
the motherland of viticulture. But
coming back to the ill-named town
has a beach-day warmness to it.
While comedy lovers should be
thrilled that this isn't the end for
"Cougar Town," few can say that
seeing Jules and Grayson liter-
ally ride a stallion into the sunset
wouldn't be a charming, fitting
final image.

-'Huntsman' trips, falls on sword

Deceit in cuisine

Update for efficiency

New adaptation
brings stunning
imagery, little else
By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
SeniorArts Editor
Look no further than the grow-
ing abundance of Grimm-inspired
television series to see that live-
action retellings
of the fairytale
classics are one of
the year's defin- Snow White
ing trends. But
even with the and the
recent satura- Huntsman
tion of familiar
princesses and At Quality16
knights resurfac- and Rave
ing, it's still hard Universal
to understand
why 2012 has
seen two two big-budget adapta-
tions of the familiar tale of Snow
White. While Tarsem Singh's "Mir-
ror Mirror" takes a much more
playful, campy take on its princess's

journey, first-time feature filmmak-
er Rupert Sanders spins a tale much
more rooted in the visual. But while
at times this dark retelling hints at
imagination, it slips into the generic
and fails to bring its central charac-
ters to life.
Themovie'smosthauntingacuity
comes in the form of Charlize Ther-
on's ("Young Adult") Ravenna, the
evil queen who spellbounds her way
into agrievingking's heart. Ayoung
Snow White looks at her stepmoth-
er-to-be in awe of her beauty. But on
their wedding night, Ravenna kills
the king while whispering a biting,
poignant soliloquy about a former
king who ruined her and how men
just use women for their own ben-
efit. The film'sbeginningastays close
to Ravenna, exploring her compli-
cated motives for coveting beauty,
which she disdainfully regards as
woman's only source of power and
influence. She's damaged, full of
visceral emotions. And these first
unfoldings of the film are steeped
in complex themes of vengeance,
obsession, even possible insanity.
Theron plays Ravenna with nuance

and alluring movement, vulnerable
one moment, volatile the next.
But the themes introduced at
the inception flicker and fade by
the time Snow (Kristen Stewart,
"Twilight") and her indistinct band
of brethren become the narrative's
centerpiece. A psychological, smart
story suddenly becomes a stilted
epic. The story's hero goes from
damsel to Joan of Arc loan instant,
and both the script and Stewart
can't seem to figure out who this
girl is supposed to be. Stewart
stumbles in her delivery and doesn't
quite have the commanding pres-
ence to fill the armor she dons to
lead a revolution.
And the rest of the characters
are too caricatured to be anything
more than symbols and devices
to decorate Snow White's quest.
Chris Hemsworth's ("The Cabin in
the Woods") Huntsman is endear-
ing, but is defined only by his mel-
ancholy. The presence of William
(Sam Claflin, "United"), a child-
hood companion of Snow White,
adds absolutely nothing to the story
other than an unnecessary love tri-
angle that seems to be contractual-
ly obligated for any movie starring
Stewart. Sam Spruell ("The Hurt
Locker") brings a bewitching, dis-
turbing malevolence to the queen's
brother Finn, but his near-sensual
attachment to his sister remains -
like so many of these characters'

'I told those haters I could handle serious emotions.'

purposes and facets - unexplored.
"Huntsman" is as obsessed with
aesthetics as its villain, but the
careful attention given to indelible,
beautiful imagery isn'tseen in other
aspects of the film - especially the
dialogue, which excepting a few
pulsing utterances from Ravenna,
is colorless. Viewers are less likely
to recall the attributes of the seven
dwarves than the visual intrica-
cies of "sanctuary," the land of the
fairies, reminiscent of "Avatar" in
its exoticness and ethereal effects.
Ravenna's enchanting, shadowy
wardrobe is just as defining to the
character as her manic physicality.
Take away the sweeping land-
scapes, the swirling flocks of crows,

the repeated image of three drops
of dark red blood falling into white-
ness, the phantom soldiers who
shatter into shards of brilliantly
black glass, the unsettling aging
and de-aging of Ravenna's features
... what's left is a tale of a fair, vir-
ginal princess whose heart, inno-
cence and youth brings the walls of
a fierce and monstrous queen tum-
bling down.
It's a story remembered from
childhood, and "Huntsman" adds
no lasting newness or richness to
the characters or their journey. It's
a black-and-white account of good
triumphing over evil, a too-routine
retelling with stylistic renovation
and unfulfilled innovation.

MINNEAPOLIS - I decided
to take a short vacation home
before starting my internship.
When I
arrived inthe
Twin Cities,
I first took
the train to
visit family,
rode the light
rail to Tar-
get Field to
watch a rare MATTHEW
Twins win, ZABKA
and finally
took the
commuter rail 70 miles to visit
my undergraduate university in
St. Cloud. It was a great trip, but
in the back of my mind, I was
still stressed out because I didn't
know how I'd be able to travel the
30 miles daily from Ann Arbor to
Dearborn without owning a car
for my internship.
Living in Ann Arbor without
a car is easy because of the great
bus systems. However, the rest
of southeast Michigan's mass
transit system needs improve-
ment. The culture of animosity
between Detroit and its suburbs
has hurt the region's mass tran-
sit system, but Michigan's partial
takeover of Detroit via the recent
consent agreement could offer
an opportunity to improve this
system.
Detroit's mass transit sys-
tem consists of two separate bus
systems with many redundant
routes. One is managed by the
Detroit Department of Trans-
portation (DDOT), and the other
is managed by the Suburban
Mobility Authority for Regional
Transportation (SMART).
Both systems are inefficient.
A trip from downtown Detroit
to Detroit Metro Airport by car
takes less than 25 minutes. But
by bus, it takes at least an hour
and 30 minutes. Last week, The
Detroit News published a let-
ter by DDOT's new CEO Ronald
Freeland in which he admits
that, before he took over, there

were days when only 67 percent in merging the two systems, as
of DDOT's scheduled routes ran. suburban leaders are unwilling

the time the finale aired, the snappy

But the show was still very much

these episodes, so showrunners Bill
Lawrence and Kevin Biegel created
a finale that could say "goodbye for
now" or "goodbye forever" and still
leave viewers satiated. For Biegel

First ruling on
marijuana act by
state supreme court
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily News Editor
On Thursday, in a unanimous
decision, the state's Supreme
Court made its first ruling
regarding enforcement of the
Michigan Medical Marijuana
Act,
The court ruled that the Michi-
gan Court of Appeals had too nar-
rowly and intricately interpreted
the MMMA when it stated that
Shiawassee resident Larry King
could not legally grow medical
marijuana in his outdoor dog ken-
nel, the Associated Press report-
ed.
After Owosso police found
marijuana plants in King's kennel,
prosecutors eharged King - who
holds a medical marijuana card
for chronic back pain - with man-
ufacturing marijuana. King's ken-
nel had a locked 6-foot high fence
and a black plastic roof that par-
tially covered the crop, according
to the AP.
Today's ruling also affected

the case of Oakland County resi-
dent Alexander Kolanek, who was
arrested before the MMMA went
into effect for possessing mari-
juana that he claimed was to sup-
press symptoms of Lyme disease.
Kolanek argued the possession of
the substance was legal, because
he had obtained a doctor's autho-
rization following the act. How-
ever, the Supreme Court affirmed
a previous appellate court ruling
that a patient must already hold a
doctor's recommendation in hand
when asserting the use of mari-
juana for medical reasons.
In a statement this evening,
Dan Korbkin, a staff attorney
for the American Civil Liberties
Union of Michigan, praised the
Supreme Court for clarifying the
state law.
"Across the state, patients have
not been able to assert their rights
under the Medical Marijuana Act
because the Court of Appeals in
this case misinterpreted the law,"
Korobkin said. "This decision
makes it very clear: a patient who
uses marijuana to treat their med-
ical conditions with the approval
by their doctor should not be pun-
ished for mere technical errors
regarding the number of plants or
how they were secured."

From Page 1A
gie Classification, a framework for
recognizing an institution's range
of prowess, to the metrics Snyder
had originally proposed, which
includes the number of Pell Grants
a university is awarded.
"The metrics compare the
state's universities against each
other, rather than against their
Carnegie Classification peers,"
Coleman said in her testimony.
The plan approved by the joint
committee yesterday adopts the
Carnegie Classification.
In an interview Saturday, Wil-
banks said that she thought the
implementation of the classifica-
tion was an improvement from
past versions of the budget.
"This budget does take a step
forward in recognizing the Carn-
egie classification as an appropri-
ate peer comparison group rather
than comparing the universities to
each other just within the state,"
she said. "We were very pleased to
see the recognition that the Carn-
egie classification was used in part
to distribute funding."
The budget also adjusts the
University's reporting require-
ments for its embryonic stem cell
research, another major point of
contention between the Univer-
sity and state lawmakers.
In April, the University sent a
packet of press releases and scien-
tific journal articles to the House
Appropriations Subcommittee on
Higher Education instead of the
specific figures the subcommittee

requested. The subcommittee then calling it an inadequate invest-
