Two bills that could affect 
free speech on campus passed 
in the Michigan House of 
Representatives’ 
House 
Oversight Committee on Sept. 
5. The bills aim to regulate 
the extent to which a college 
or university can implement 
policies relating to the free 
speech of students and staff. 
The two pieces of legislation 
were sponsored by state Rep. 
John Reilly, R-Oakland, and 
come almost a year after white 
nationalist 
Richard 
Spencer 
came to East Lansing to speak 
at Michigan State University 
and was met with protesters, 
where two dozen people were 
arrested. The first bill, titled 

“The 
Campus 
Free 
Speech 
Act,” defines the circumstances 
under which a public college 
or university is permitted to 
limit “expressive conduct” on 
campus and details the type 
of legal action students or 
staff can take when the act is 
violated. 
The 
second 
bill, 
“The 
College Campus Intellectual 
and 
Expressive 
Freedom 
Act,” requires each college or 
university to create a policy 
on free speech in accordance 
with 
state-wide 
standards 
while also making the policy 
transparent 
and 
understood 
by both students and staff 
members. 
The 
legislation 
clarifies what form of protest 
is allowed and would make it 

easier for controversial figures 
and speakers to visit campus 
— 
including 
Spencer 
and 
conservative commentator Ben 
Shapiro, who came to speak at 
the University of Michigan in 
March.
LSA 
senior 
Kate 
Westa, 
former 
vice 
chair 
of 
the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 
conservative 
organization 
Young America’s Foundation 
and 
current 
co-president 
of 
political 
organization 
WeListen, expressed support 
for the bill and argued public 
institutions of higher education 
should not have power over 
the views expressed on their 
campuses.
“A 
public 
university 
should not be in the business 

of deciding which of their 
students get to host speakers 
or speak their minds,” Westa 
said. “It is the government’s 
responsibility to ensure that 
our rights are protected, and 
if the First Amendment is 
being trampled on or amended 
by speech codes or unfair 
treatment, then it is absolutely 
within their purview to stop 
that from happening.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Sam 
Burnstein, 
a 
founding 
member of Michigan Political 
Consulting 
and 
elected 
representative for LSA Student 
Government, 
said 
he 
was 
appreciative of the freedom of 
speech available on campus.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

In new data published by 
the Center for the Study of 
Education Policy at Illinois State 
University, Michigan ranked 
44th nationally in per-resident 
support of higher education for 
the fiscal year 2019. 
On 
a 
per-dollar 
basis, 
Michigan spent $195.52 per 
resident, while the national 

average 
stands 
at 
$280.60. 
According to calculations, if 
Michigan were to increase its 
spending per-resident to the 
national 
average, 
Michigan 
would be investing almost $850 
million more into its higher 
education institutions. 
This new data comes as 
a dramatic shift from a few 
decades ago when Michigan 
was above the state average 
in per resident spending on 

higher education. In 2001, for 
example, 
Michigan 
ranked 
20th nationally in per resident 
spending on higher education 
at $230.56, not adjusting for 
inflation.
In March, Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer proposed to reverse 
this 
trend 
by 
increasing 
funding for Michigan’s higher 
education institutions by 3 
percent, totalling around $45.6 
million, for the fiscal year 

2020. Meanwhile, Michigan’s 
legislature has pushed for a 
different budget that allocates 
a 1 percent increase in higher 
education spending. 
Around campus, opinions 
seem to be divided with some 
students bringing up Michigan’s 
tuition and others mentioning 
the impact raising taxes 
would have on taxpayers. 
On Sept. 4, Michigan Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer announced 
a ban that will stop the sale of 
flavored e-cigarettes and other 
nicotine vaping products. The 
ban also prohibits marketing 
vaping as “clean,” “safe” or 
“healthy.” 
In order to speed up the 
process of creating the ban, 
Whitmer ordered the Michigan 
Department 
of 
Health 
and 
Human 
Services 
to 
draft 
emergency rules banning the 
products. This allows state 
agencies to create policies that 
will act as laws after being 
authorized, according to the 
Lansing State Journal. The ban 
will reportedly be filed in a few 
weeks, and then retailers will 
have 30 days to comply. 
 Rule 2 of the ban states 
someone found with at least 
four of the banned products, 
will be assumed to have intent 
to sell them, which is prohibited 
under the ban. 
“A person who possesses 
four 
or 
more 
flavored 
vapor products, or flavored 
alternative nicotine products is 
rebuttably presumed to possess 
said items with the intent to 
sell,” the rule reads.

carbon future

Announcement comes on eve of 
Washtenaw County Climate Strike

Michael Solomon, dean of 
Rackham Graduate School, 
hosted a talk on rethinking 
graduate 
education 
Wednesday afternoon. About 
200 community members, 
including graduate faculty 
and staff attended the event. 
Solomon 
began 
by 
defining 
the 
traditional 
apprenticeship 
model 
of 
graduate education, which 
is based on an intellectual 
connection 
between 
faculty 
and 
students. 
While 
acknowledging 
the 
successes 
of 
this 
model, 
Solomon identified building 
pressures he believes need 
to be addressed. Displaying 
a number of headlines on the 
projector, 
Rackham 
listed 
some of the controversies 
facing graduate education, 
including 
the 
tightening 
job 
market 
for 
doctorate 
degrees, 
mental 
health 
concerns and instances of 
sexual harassment.
Solomon 
proposed 
Rackham could be a leader 
in transforming the model of 
graduate education in order 
to address these issues.

University 
of 
Michigan 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
announced 
Wednesday 
morning the University will 
be joining the University 
Climate Change Coalition, 
a group of leading research 
universities collaborating on 
a model to help communities 
move toward a low-carbon 
future. The decision comes 
on the eve of the University-
sponsored Earthfest and two 
days before the Washtenaw 
County Climate Strike is set 
to take place on the Diag.
The 
move 
follows 
a 
recommendation 
from 
the 
President’s 
Commission 
on Carbon Neutrality. In a 
University 
Record 
article 
published 
Wednesday 
morning, 
Schlissel 
said 
climate 
change 
is 
an 
issue that must be solved 
collaboratively. 
“The problem of global 
climate change is far too 
big for any one institution 
to 
solve 
alone,” 
Schlissel 
said. 
“Collaboration 
and 
engagement 
are 
key 
to 
creating 
real 
and 
lasting 
solutions that will benefit our 
society.” 

The coalition, which is 
run 
by 
the 
organization 
Second 
Nature 
and 
commonly 
referred 
to 
as 
UC3, unites 20 universities 
across the continent in an 
effort to accelerate climate 
change 
solutions 
through 
innovative ideas and action. 
The coalition’s primary goal 
is 
to 
foster 
collaboration 
among prominent academic 
institutions 
across 
the 
country 
toward 
a 
more 
sustainable future.
In an email to The Daily, 
University 
spokesman 
Rick Fitzgerald wrote the 
commission felt joining the 
coalition would support the 
University’s goal of having 
an impact beyond campus. 
Fitzgerald explained Schlissel 
accepted the commission’s 
recommendation and signed 
a letter committing to the 
suggestions on Aug. 29.
“As you may know, one of 
the main reasons President 
Schlissel 
appointed 
the 
President’s 
Commission 
on Carbon Neutrality was 
to look for ways in which 
the university could have a 
broader impact beyond the 
border of the Ann Arbor 
campus,” Fitzgerald wrote.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich., 
withdrew 
her 
support from a bill promoting 
human rights for Palestinian 
children last week. The bill, 
titled 
“Promoting 
Human 
Rights for Palestinian Children 
Living Under Israeli Military 
Occupation 
Act,” 
would 
require that funds from the 
U.S. “do not support military 
detention, 
interrogation, 
abuse, 
or 
ill-treatment 
of 
Palestinian children.”
In an email statement to 
The 
Daily, 
Dingell 
wrote 
that she remains dedicated 
to advocating for a two-state 
solution in Israel.
“We must be committed to 
promoting a peaceful, two-
state solution that empowers 
the Palestinian people to live 

in dignity and security with 
Israel,” Dingell wrote. “That 
relies on policies that lay the 
groundwork for that goal and is 
why I’ve been strongly critical 
of unilateral moves that serve 
as an obstacle toward peace.” 
Dingell explained that after 
discussing with community 
members, 
she 
decided 
the 
bill 
was 
“ultimately 
counterproductive 
to 
a 
peaceful, two-state solution 
to 
the 
Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict.”
Dingell, a Democrat, was 
originally 
elected 
in 
2014, 
succeeding her recently late 
husband John Dingell. Her 
district covers parts of Ann 
Arbor, along with some of 
western metropolitan Detroit 
and Dearborn, an area with 
a 
significant 
Palestinian 
population and one of the 

largest 
Arab-American 
populations in the country. 
The bill, introduced in April, 
states its purpose is to promote 
human rights for Palestinian 
children living under Israeli 
military occupation. It has 21 
co-sponsors, 
including 
U.S. 
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., 
the first Palestinian-American 
woman elected to Congress. 
According to the proposed 
legislation, between 500 and 
700 Palestinian children ages 
of 12 through 17 are detained 
and 
prosecuted 
“before 
a 
military court system that 
lacks basic and fundamental 
guarantees 
of 
due 
process 
in violation of international 
standards.” The bill claims 
such treatment of Palestinian 
children 
is 
pertinent 
to 
Congress because it violates 
international law. 
Public Policy senior 
Arwa 
Gayar 
is 
an 
executive 
member 
of 
Students 
Allied 
for 
Freedom and Equality, 
a Palestinian solidarity 
organization on campus. 
Gayar 
said 
she 
was 
surprised 
by 
Dingell’s 
decision. 
“Debbie Dingell had a 
very progressive voting 
record on issues relating 
to the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict. She often is very 
reliable 
in 
supporting 
issues that are supported 
by 
Arab-Americans,” 
Gayar 
said. 
“I 
was 
definitely 
surprised 
when 
she 
withdrew 
her support, especially 
because the bill itself is 
about promoting human 
rights 
for 
Palestinian 
children.”
The bill would amend 
the Foreign Assistance 
Act of 1961 to specify that 
no funds appropriated to 
another country could 
be used to support “the 
military 
detention, 

interrogation, abuse, or ill-
treatment 
of 
children 
in 
violation 
of 
international 
humanitarian law.” 
The bill also allocates $19 
million each year to non-
governmental 
organizations 
that either monitor human 
rights 
abuses 
associated 
with 
Israel’s 
treatment 
of 
Palestinian children or provide 
health treatment to children 
who have been detained. 
LSA senior Zayd Elkahlah 
said as a Palestinian, Dingell’s 
withdrawal of support from 
the bill feels “wrong and 
weird” to her, given that it 
pertains to the human rights of 
Palestinian children. 
“You’re not choosing a side 
here — kids don’t have a side, 
they’re just kids,” Elkahlah 
said. “I think she also said in 
a tweet that she would never 
do action to harm Palestinian 
children, but at the same time, 
by her not acting, by not taking 
action, she is harming the 
children.”
While Gayar said she does 
not think Dingell will lose 
people’s support in the 2020 
election over this, she said she 
thinks it will give some people 
pause. 
“I think this hesitates some 
people on their support for 
her, and I think honestly a 
lot of it is just wanting more 
transparency 
and 
clarity 
in the process,” Gayar said. 
“I 
think 
a 
representative 
democracy depends on that 
public 
accountability 
and 
I think decisions like this 
where she’s not only citing 
public engagement, but it also 
demands public engagement 
from 
constituents 
are 
so 
important to make sure that 
there’s transparency in that 
process.”

“I don’t know that 
it will be such a 
significant impact 
just raising taxes 
a little bit more 
to apply towards 
higher education.”

“The 
campus 
climate 
on free speech reflects our 
school’s diversity — racially, 
ethnically, socioeconomically, 
etc. — though it often struggles 
to incorporate diversity of 
thought,” Burnstein said. “Ann 
Arbor is a liberal, progressive 
college town, so it lends itself 
well to including those voices, 
but it struggles to incorporate 
ideas which go against that 
grain.”
Burnstein 
reflected 
on 
when Richard Spencer tried to 
book space on the University’s 
campus in 2017, resulting in 
widespread 
student 
outcry 
and protests.
“He threatened to sue U-M 
if they were to bar him from 
campus,” Burnstein said. “I 
don’t think blocking a speaker 
from campus is effective. I 
firmly believe the only way to 
truly eradicate the ideas he 
espouses is with better ideas.”
\University 
spokesman 
Rick Fitzgerald praised the 
University’s 
current 
free 
speech policies in an email to 
The Daily.
“Free speech is a bedrock 
principle at the University of 
Michigan,” Fitzgerald wrote. 
“The university has had a 
strong 
freedom 
of 
speech 
policy in place for decades that 
often is used as a model for 
policies at other universities.” 
The University’s freedom 
of speech policy is detailed 
in the U-M Standard Practice 
Guide Policies page under 
“Freedom 
of 
Speech 
and 
Artistic Expression.” The page 

asserts the University values 
different points of view and 
that the rights of speakers and 
protesters at events should 
be protected. At the same 
time, however, the right to 
free speech does not protect 
“undue interference” in which 
a protester disrupts an event 
or prevents a speaker from 
expressing their viewpoint, 
though the policy makes it 
clear the interference has to 
be egregious and prolonged in 
order to be deemed undue. 
“Expression 
of 
diverse 
points of view is of the highest 
importance, 
not 
only 
for 
those who espouse a cause 
or position and then defend 
it, but also for those who 
hear and pass judgment on 
that defense,” the SPG reads. 
“The belief that an opinion 
is pernicious, false, or in any 
other way detestable cannot be 
grounds for its suppression.”
In a statement released 
in 
April, 
Reilly 
testified 
before the House Oversight 
Committee to explain the 
legal basis for the creation of 
these bills. 
“The state’s public colleges 
and 
universities 
have 
the 
responsibility 
to 
uphold 
the constitutional rights of 
students and the community 
on campus grounds,” Reilly 
said. “Right now, students 
at multiple universities live 
under speech policies that 
infringe on their rights to 
free speech and assembly. 
Due to some schools’ ongoing 
unwillingness to ensure their 
rights, the legislature must do 
so.”
That same day in April, 
state Rep. Darrin Camilleri, 
D-Brownstown., 
issued 
a 

statement in defense of the 
current freedom of speech 
policies 
on 
public 
college 
campuses while criticizing the 
bills for what he described as 
overreach.
“All of Michigan’s colleges 
— both in policy and in 
practice — already respect 
and protect the rights of all to 
engage in free speech, but they 
do so with the simultaneous 
obligation to guarantee the 
safety and security of those 
who attend their institutions,” 
Camilleri 
said. 
“This 
legislation would tie the hands 
of college officials by creating 
a one-size-fits-all approach at 
the expense of student safety. 
Our 
Constitution 
already 
protects free speech on and off 
college campuses. These bills 
are unnecessary and negligent 
as they not only seek to fix 
a system that is not broken, 
they invite hate speech and 
potential violence onto our 
college campuses.”
Fitzgerald 
explained 
the 
University would not comment 
on the bills at the moment.
“We do not have anything 
to add regarding the proposed 
legislation, 
but 
we 
will 
continue (to) watch closely 
as (these) bills move forward 
through 
the 
legislative 
process,” Fitzgerald said.
Michigan is not the only 
state in which legislatures 
are pursuing free speech bills. 
Several other states, including 
Illinois, South Carolina and 
New Jersey are considering 
pieces of legislation that would 
influence the way in which 
freedom of speech is handled 
on 
college 
or 
university 
campuses.

external 
partners to share and gain 
knowledge 
to 
accelerate 
climate change solutions.”
This 
decision 
comes 
after a semester of climate-
related activism, primarily 
from 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Climate 
Action 
Movement. In March, the 
group hosted a climate 
strike, which resulted in a 
sit-in at Schlissel’s office 
and 10 arrests.
Following the strike, the 
Climate Action Movement 
members held an indefinite 
sit-in, 
attended 
events 
with Schlissel and spoke 
at regents meetings. The 
University added a public 
session to its series of 
town halls in order to hear 
community input.
In 
June, 
six 
demonstrators who were 
charged with trespassing 
during the first climate 
strike appeared in court for 
a pre-trial, which resulted 
in a Sept. 9 court date. At 
the September meeting, the 
six once again appeared in 
court to review the facts of 
the case and any evidence 
ahead of the Oct. 10 trial 
date.
LSA 
senior 
Dim 
Mang, an organizer for 
the 
climate 
strike, 
felt 
joining the coalition was 
a positive step, but she 
questioned the timing. She 
specifically pointed to an 
announcement 
from 
the 
University 
of 
California 
on Tuesday declaring a 
climate 
emergency 
and 
committing itself to carbon 
neutrality by 2025 as well 
as the upcoming climate 
strike.
“With all due respect to 
the president, I think the 
timing is a little strange, 
not only because the strike 
is coming up, but because 
of what the UC system has 

just decided to do,” Mang 
said. “I’m not questioning 
the sincerity of joining 
the coalition, I just want 
to 
understand 
why 
he 
wouldn’t 
do 
it 
sooner 
or 
what’s 
the 
point 
of 
joining it right now, at this 
moment, when there are 
other ways that he could aid 
climate action movements 
and other initiatives on 
campus.”
Similarly, 
LSA 
junior 
Solomon Medintz, who is 
also an organizer of the 
strike and a columnist for 
The Daily, said he feels the 
University needs to take 
action beyond this.
“From what I do know, 
it seems like a good step, 
but what I also know is 
that the University just 
invested $80 million in 
the Central Power Plant, I 
know the University has a 
billion dollars invested in 
fossil fuels and I know that 
the University has the least 
ambitious carbon neutrality 
goals of any school in the 
Big Ten,” Medintz said. 
“(I’m) super happy that 
they’re joining the national 
climate change coalition, 
but I think it underscores 
the amount of work that 
needs to be done trying to 
push the University to take 
real climate action.”
The University has taken 
action to achieve Schlissel’s 
commitment 
to 
gaining 
carbon neutrality. Some of 
these 
initiatives 
include 
coordinating 
community 
forums, 
commissioning 
internal 
analysis 
teams, 
engaging 
the 
student 
communities and seeking 
proposals 
from 
external 
firms 
on 
environmental 
concerns at the University. 
Rackham student Austin 
Glass, a member of the 
commission, 
said 
UC3 
brings schools of similar 
stature together.
“One of the important 
parts of UC3 is that it’s a sort 
of concentration of passion, 
it’s 
a 
concentration 
of 
interest, it’s a concentration 
of 
information, 
it’s 

concentration 
of 

resources,” 
Glass 
said. 
“The nice thing about UC3 
is that it’s collaborative and 
that the sort of logic behind 
it is logic that pervades a lot 
of work in this area, which 
is that we’re stronger when 
we’re 
working 
together, 
especially when we have 
a common goal, and we do 
have a common goal.”
Glass 
said 
being 
in 
the coalition allows the 
University to hold itself to 
the other institutions in the 
coalition. He specifically 
pointed to the University 
of California system as one 
member 
the 
University 
could take cues from.
The 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality 
is 
hosting a forum to update 
the community on Sept. 25 
at 4:30 p.m. in Rackham. 

Additionally, 
the 

University is planning an 
Earth 
Day 
celebration, 
which will be the first of a 
series of events focused on 
sustainability. 
Thursday’s 
EarthFest is set to take 
place 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on 
the Diag with the goal 
of 
bringing 
together 
environmental leaders to 
explore how to create a 
better future for the planet. 
LSA 
junior 
Olivia 
Thomas, who has worked 
in various sustainability-
focused positions at the 
University, said this is a 
step in the right direction. 
Thomas 
hopes 
this 
is 
one of many actions the 
University will take.
“We need to show that 
we;re really focusing on 
leadership 
and 
action, 
and 
being 
a 
leader 
in 
this issue,” Thomas said. 
“Students just want to see 
more dedication from the 
President and the regents 
on this issue. I think it’s 
certainly important that 
we’re 
leading 
the 
way 
and I think joining this 
coalition is a good idea and 
a good step to show our 
dedication, but I do think 
we need to be doing more 
than that.”

LSA 
junior 
Derek 
Li 
admitted he did not know much 
about the higher education 
spending in the state, but 
found it surprising given the 
size of Michigan.
 Li also said it makes 
sense 
given 
how 
high 
tuition is.
“It’s 
surprising,” 
Li 
said. 
“I 
didn’t 
really 
know much about this 
prior but it is surprising 
considering how big of 
the University Michigan 
is and in terms of our 
public ranking and what 
not. It does make sense, 
though, given how high 
tuition is especially for 
out-of-state students.”
Li 
voiced 
some 
understanding regarding 
why Michigan’s ranking, 
saying he did not want to 
raise spending if it would 
have a negative impact on 
taxpayers. 
“If too high spending is 
detrimental to residents 
and 
if 
taxes 
were 
increased in a way that 
would hurt them then 
I feel like it would be 
understandable to keep 
spending low,” Li said.
When he learned of 
Whitmer’s 
proposal 
to 

increase the state budget 
by 3 percent, Li showed 
general approval of it.
“A 3-percent increase 
seems 
high,” 
Li 
said. 
“As long has Whitmer 
evaluated the effects of 
this spending though, I 

think it should be fine. It 
definitely sounds like a 
plus for us.”
Engineering 
junior 
Alex Schiffer, a student 
from Indiana, said he 
was not too surprised by 
the lower level of higher 

education spending.
“I come from a very 
conservative 
state 
so 
the lack of spending in 
higher education is not 
surprising,” 
Schiffer 
said.
LSA freshman Ignacio 
Barreras 
pushed 
back 
against 
the 
sentiment 
that spending more on 
higher education would 
hurt Michigan taxpayers.
“I don’t know that it 
will be such a significant 
impact 
just 
raising 
taxes a little bit more 
to apply towards higher 
education,” 
Barreras 
said.
Barreras also brought 
up 
tuition 
at 
the 
university 
in 
relation 
to the state’s ranking, 
explaining higher tuition 
and costs are worth the 
superior 
education 
at 
U-M.
“Tuition is very high 
considering that I am 
an out of state student,” 
Barreras 
said. 
“It 
is 
definitely 
than 
other 
public schools but my 
family decided to take 
the investment because 
of the competitiveness of 
this school.”
However, Barreras said 
the U-M itself does not 
need additional funding 
in his opinion.

Rule 6 also states a person 
who violates rule two will be 
charged with a misdemeanor 
and could face up to six months 
in prison and/or a fine of up to 
$200 per item.
“A person who violates any 
provision of these rules is guilty 
of a misdemeanor, punishable 
by imprisonment for not more 
than six months, or a fine of not 
more than $200, or both,” the 
rule reads. “Violations of rule 2 
are calculated on a per-item and 
per-transaction basis and may 
be punished cumulatively.”
Police officers are not legally 
allowed to randomly stop and 
check for contraband, Law 
professor 
Gabriel 
Mendlow 
wrote in an email to The Daily. 
However, he said if they can tell 
someone is smoking a flavored 
vape, they are allowed to take it 
and arrest them. 
“If a police officer can tell 

somehow 
that 
the 
product 
you’re vaping is flavored – by 
smelling it, for example – 
then the Constitution allows 
the police officer to seize the 
product and, in theory, arrest 
you,” Mendlow said. “But if the 
only thing a police officer knows 
is that you’re vaping, then she 
isn’t allowed to force you to let 
her check whether the product 
you’re vaping is flavored.”
Mendlow added if someone 
does wind up in court, the 
“intent to sell” clause could 
be rebutted if there is a good 
explanation for why someone 
was 
in 
possession 
of 
the 
prohibited 
items, 
but 
the 
prosecutor could argue against 
this. 
“The 
prosecutor 
could 
argue 
that 
you 
possessed 
more flavored products than 
someone would possess who 
intended to use the products 
personally 
rather 
than 
sell 
them,” Mendlow said. “Under 
the emergency rules, there’s a 
rebuttable presumption that 

anyone who possesses four or 
more flavored products intends 
to sell them. This means that 
if you possess four or more 
flavored products and you don’t 
offer an innocent explanation, 
you may be convicted on these 
facts alone.”
Many University of Michigan 
students 
expressed 
concern 
regarding 
how 
the 
AAPD 
would implement the ban and 
explained vaping has become 
a common social activity on 
campus. Due to the soon-to-
be illegal nature of the topic, 
the three students interviewed 
requested 
anonymity. 
They 
will be referred to as Student 1, 
Student 2 and Student 3. 
Student 1 said she used to 
vape a lot, but she felt some 
negative health effects from 
it and was spending a lot of 
money, so now she mostly uses 
other people’s products when 
she wants to vape.

The rise in reformist prosecutors

O

ver the past couple 
years, there has been 
a surge of progressive 
candidates 
running 
for, 
and 
winning, 
various 
district 
attorney 
positions. 
These 
candidates, 
from New York to 
Los 
Angeles, 
have 
been 
advocating 
for 
policies 
that 
decriminalize drugs 
and ease up on non-
violent 
offenders 
with 
the 
intent 
to 
combat 
mass 
incarceration. 
This 
recent 
occurrence is a break from 
the 
traditional 
prosecutor 
position of being tough on 
crime and supporting strict 
criminal 
penalties. 
Larry 
Krasner, 
the 
Philadelphia 
district 
attorney 
and 
one 
of 
the 
first 
progressive 
prosecutors in a major city, 
is 
widely 
considered 
to 
be at the forefront of this 
movement. He ran in 2017 for 
the Democratic nomination 
in a seven-way race. Despite 
earning no major newspaper 
endorsements, Krasner still 
won the nomination by an 
almost 
18-percent 
margin 
and went on to win the 
general election by about 50 
percentage points. 
These elections can be some 
of the most impactful on the 
local level because DAs have 
what is called “prosecutorial 
discretion,” 
which 
gives 
them almost absolute power 
in charging someone with a 
crime. They also structure 
plea agreements, which is 
how 
97 
percent 
of 
cases 
end. Policies like mandatory 
minimum sentences further 
increase prosecutors’ power 
because they eliminate judges’ 
and juries’ say in sentencing, 
making the sentence entirely 
contingent 
on 
whichever 
charge the DA decides to 
press.
This power, however, can 
be used to institute reform, 
which is where progressive 
prosecutors come in. Rachael 
Rollins, the district attorney 
for Boston and surrounding 
municipalities, 
ran 
on 
creating 
reformist 
policies 
like 
decriminalizing 
drug 
possession and retail fraud and 
not charging for other low-
level crimes. She established 
multiple diversion programs 
that do not incarcerate the 
defendant, but rather place 

them into a rehabilitation 
or 
treatment 
program. 
Furthermore, many of these 
prosecutors 
act 
swiftly. 
Immediately after 
taking 
office, 
Wesley 
Bell, 
the 
current St. Louis 
DA, 
fired 
the 
prosecutor 
who 
was responsible for 
bringing evidence 
to the grand jury 
that 
declined 
to 
indict the police 
officer who shot 
and killed Michael Brown 
in Ferguson in 2014. He also 
has set up a department to 
review and investigate past 
convictions, which is isolated 
from the rest of the office 
and reports exclusively to 
Bell. 
In 
announcing 
this 
initiative, Bell acknowledged 
that false convictions happen 
frequently, and said his role 
as district attorney should 
include the responsibility of 
reviewing cases to limit such 
occurrences.
Not everyone is happy with 
such 
policies. 
The 
police 
union in Chicago criticized 
Kim Foxx, the progressive 
Cook County district attorney, 
arguing that she should focus 
on enforcing laws instead of 
trying to change the policies. 
Tiffany Cabán ran for the 
Democratic 
nomination 
for 
district 
attorney 
in 
the 
Queens 
borough 
of 
New York City on a very 
progressive campaign, even 
announcing that she would 
not prosecute sex workers. 
She narrowly lost to a slightly 
less 
progressive 
candidate. 
Critics of these shifts claim 
reformist 
measures 
will 
allow 
crime 
to 
flourish, 
arguing 
that 
prosecutors 
should be as tough on crime 
as possible and that these 
new policies treat criminals 
as victims. They also take 
issue with district attorneys 
refusing to prosecute certain 
crimes, saying that it is the 
legislature’s job to set laws 
and a prosecutor’s job to 
enforce them. 
This argument is partially 
valid. The justice system is 
predicated 
on 
prosecutors 
and defense attorneys making 
the strongest arguments on 
behalf of the people or their 
client, 
respectively, 
which 
means 
many 
high-level 
crimes should be enforced to 

the fullest extent possible. 
That said, a prosecutor’s 
duty 
is 
also 
to 
protect 
the 
populace, 
and 
many 
progressives have pointed 
out that the current hard-
on-crime philosophy toward 
low-level offenses like drug 
possession 
or 
shoplifting 
takes 
young 
people 
who 
have 
made 
mistakes 
and 
feeds them into a system 
that 
reinforces 
criminal 
tendencies. 
Rehabilitation 
programs, they argue, will 
reduce recidivism.
The 
recent 
rise 
in 
popularity 
for 
these 
progressive 
prosecutors 
demonstrates 
the 
public’s 
willingness 
to 
accept 
change. After decades of 
policy that penalized young 
people — largely people of 
color — addressing the need 
for 
reformist 
prosecutors 
has 
moved 
beyond 
the 
fringes of the political field. 
The movement has reached 
Ann Arbor. Eli Savit, an 
Ann Arbor native and the 
current senior legal counsel 
for the city of Detroit, has 
announced 
his 
candidacy 
for 
the 
2020 
Democratic 
nomination for DA. Savit 
is running on progressive 
values and decriminalizing 
many low-level offenses. 
Progressive 
reforms 
are 
moving in the right direction. 
If 
a 
progressive 
criminal 
justice philosophy becomes 
more accepted within the 
mainstream political field, 
it can change the tendency 
of the justice system to turn 
low-level 
criminals 
into 
more violent offenders. That 
will create a criminal justice 
system that more effectively 
prevents crime rather than 
one that reproduces it. 
That 
is 
something 
to 
remember 
when 
we 
vote 
on our district attorneys, 
because having the ability 
to choose who controls the 
criminal proceedings in our 
respective districts requires 
us to consider the impact 
that person will have on our 
communities. At the center 
of that analysis should be 
the question of whether that 
candidate 
will 
distinguish 
between a young adult who 
has 
made 
mistakes 
and 
someone who is a legitimate 
threat to those around them.

O

n the Friday preceding 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
football 
team’s home game against 
Army, the Michigan Marching 
Band released a social media 
statement 
urging 
fans 
to 
refrain from booing during 
the 
home 
band’s 
pregame 
performance of Army’s fight 
song. It was a call for fans to 
not only respect the service 
that cadets at the U.S. Military 
Academy provide to the people 
of the United States following 
graduation, but also to respect 
all U.S. military personnel 
they represent.
I 
believe 
such 
personal 
and contextual awareness is 
foundational to our decision-
making. Such thoughtfulness 
leads 
to 
more 
positive 
interpersonal 
interactions 
and 
larger-scale 
societal 
trends. 
But 
habitually 
building this awareness is 
particularly challenging for 
undergraduates. 
With 
the 
advent of a new semester, 
college students are whisked 
into a frenzy of career fairs, 
applications, 
meetings, 
housing searches and social 
mazes, all while attempting 
to keep academics at the 
forefront. 
The 
volume 
of 
commitment involved in these 
activities 
leaves 
students 
with little time and energy 
to actively consider personal 
state of mind and behavior 
in 
seemingly 
insignificant 
situations. However, it is to 
our advantage – and to that of 
the greater community – for 
us to reflect on what we are 
doing, how we are feeling and 
how our words and actions 
contribute to the experiences 
of others.
Even 
the 
most 
minor 
behaviors can have significant 
positive 
effects 
on 
the 
experiences of others and 
oneself. Take, for instance, 
the action of smiling at a 
passerby. It seems, perhaps, 
quite insignificant — many of 
us would much rather keep 
staring ahead, focusing on 
the music plugged into our 
ears. However, even a simple 
smile can have significant 
consequences. Consider the 
final written words of a man 
who committed suicide by 
leaping 
from 
the 
Golden 
Gate Bridge: “I’m going to 
walk to the bridge. If one 
person smiles at me on the 
way, I won’t jump.” Not every 
interaction is going to save 
somebody’s life, but the power 
of small acts of kindness 

should not be underestimated. 
We feel good when smiled 
at by others, when someone 
holds the door for us, and 
when we are provided respect 
and 
acknowledgement 
by 
others. 
We can expand this thinking 
and consider the cumulative 
effects 
the 
collective 
behaviors of a group can exert. 
The example of the Army 
game provides a powerful 
opportunity to examine this. 
The decisions of individual 
fans to suppress their boos 
during the performance of 
Army’s fight song resulted in 
an overall display of respect 
for 
U.S. 
military 
trainees 

and 
personnel. 
Of 
course, 
there are valid reasons for 
which 
people 
may 
have 
deliberately chosen to boo, 
including 
personal 
dislike 
for 
authoritative 
military 
actions 
in 
international 
affairs. Additionally, perhaps 
not everybody who was silent 
acted out of respect, some 
may have simply been going 
with the crowd. However, the 
sight of over 100,000 people 
acting in a respectful way lent 
a gravity to the moment — an 
indication that there was a 
reason to take the moment 
seriously. The theory behind 
why the Michigan Marching 
Band asked fans to refrain 
from booing can be applied by 
individuals to similar contexts 
in the future. When large 
numbers of individuals act on 
this kind of learning, greater 
social trends in behavior can 
shift toward the positive.
Behavioral 
decisions 
require situational awareness 
on 
an 
individual 
level. 
A 
primary 
roadblock 
to 
improving these decisions is 
the effort needed to instigate 
habitual behavioral change, 
which 
poses 
a 
significant 

problem for college students. 
This is not an indication 
that college students are 
lazy — it is, in fact, quite 
the 
opposite. 
With 
the 
inundation of coursework 
and commitments, students 
are often focused so directly 
on what needs to get done 
now that thinking about the 
way in which we behave is a 
process often left on the back 
burner indefinitely. When 
there 
are 
opportunities 
to seek momentary refuge 
from our commitments, we 
naturally try to expend less 
mental 
energy. 
In 
those 
moments, it may not matter 
to us if someone is coming 
up behind us after we open 
a door for ourselves, for 
instance, 
and 
applying 
an understanding of why 
we were requested to act 
respectfully before a football 
game may not be tempting in 
the moment.
This 
is 
where 
habit 
development 
in 
these 
behaviors 
can 
play 
a 
beneficial 
role, 
and 
thankfully, these behaviors 
become 
less 
effortful 
as 
we continue to do them. 
Benjamin Garner, a health 
psychologist at Kings College 
in the United Kingdom and 
others explain in a 2012 study 
that once a habit is formed, 
it persists “with minimal 
effort 
or 
deliberation.” 
As 
such, 
creating 
habits 
of respect and situational 
awareness makes improving 
our interactions with others 
a task that does not demand 
our concentration.
The ultimate goal is to 
promote the idea of a society 
that is happier individually 
and collectively due to our 
willingness to acknowledge 
and respect one another while 
recognizing 
that 
certain 
groups 
deserve 
selective 
positive attention for what 
they do or what they face, like 
people from the military. This 
does not mean that we all 
have to agree on the right way 
to act in certain situations; 
what is important is that we 
are conscious of why we are 
making 
certain 
decisions. 
A 
commitment 
to 
these 
behaviors is a step toward 
ensuring that there will be a 
time when football fans do not 
need to be reminded to show 
respect to those who risk 
their lives for our welfare.

HELP WANTED

S

aturday presents a pivot 
point in this Michigan 
football season.
It’s not a season-defining 
one. The Wolverines can lose 
on Saturday and still accom-
plish all 
their intend-
ed goals. On 
the converse, 
they can win 
on Saturday 
and still 
fail to reach 
those same 
goals.
It is the 
archetype 
of game Jim 
Harbaugh has yet to win and 
needs to start winning, plain 
and simple. Which begs the 
question that, on the surface, 
might seem hyperbolic: Would 
a win against Wisconsin on 
Saturday be the best victory of 
the Harbaugh era?
Substitute any words in that 
sentence — “most impressive,” 
“most meaningful”, “most 
impactful” — and you can have 
an entirely different conversa-
tion. But would it be the best?
That is highly determinant 
on, you know, how the game 
actually plays out. Would a 
30-point drubbing over the 
Badgers be far more impres-
sive than a squeaker? Maybe, 
maybe not. Does is matter how 
the rest of Wisconsin’s season 
plays out? Sure. 
But, in the interest of can-
dor, this is a question that 
speaks far more to Harbaugh’s 
teams’ shortcomings rather 
than this one specific game. 
Michigan will go to Madison 
having been an underdog in 
seven games in the Harbaugh 
era; it has lost all seven. The 
Wolverines have yet to beat a 
ranked opponent on the road 
in his tenure. Their only win 
over a top-10 team in that 
span came against Wisconsin 
at home in a game they were 
favored by nearly a touchdown.
The most impressive wins of 
the Harbaugh era are, in some 
order, as follows: 
— A 32-23 win at Michigan 
State in 2016 against a group 
that would eventually flounder 
to 3-9 on the season.
— A 21-7 win over the 24th-
ranked Spartans last year, 
which teetered in the balance 
until the Shea Patterson/Don-
ovan Peoples-Jones 79-yard 
touchdown.
— A 49-10 romp of Penn 

State in 2016.
— A 41-7 blowout over the 
14th-ranked Nittany Lions in 
what eventually amounted to a 
down year for Penn State.
— A 14-7 win over No. 8 
Wisconsin in 2016, otherwise 
known as The Jourdan Lewis 
Interception Game.
— A 38-13 win over the 15th-
ranked Badgers last year.
— A 41-7 win over Florida in 
the 2015 Citrus Bowl that set 
the table for the 2016 team to 
hit the ground running.
And that’s really it. 
The success of this year, 
as with any year now, will 
be largely determinant on 
whether or not there’s a Big 
Ten Title. That’s the only bar 
worth discussing right now. 
And Michigan cannot win 
those until they start winning 
these types of games. 
The Wolverines haven’t won 
in Madison since 2001, which 
is a stat that has been repeated 
all week, but ignores they’ve 
only played four such contests 
in that span. One that holds 
more weight? The last time 
Michigan went on the road and 
beat a top-15 team was… Sep-
tember 16, 2006 at No. 2 Notre 
Dame under head coach Lloyd 
Carr. They’re 0-14 in such 
games since.
That context helps bring 
us back to the Harbaugh era 
writ large, toiling still in this 
really-good-but-not-great sta-
sis that regularly seems on the 
verge of a next step. That was 
supposed to come against Ohio 
State in 2016, but fell literal 
inches short. It was supposed 
to happen in 2017 before that 
washed away in the pouring 
rain against Michigan State — 
sending the rest of the season 
flooding away with it. It was 
supposed to happen in Colum-
bus again last year, where the 
Wolverines entered roughly 

a 4-point favorite over an 
uncharacteristically vulner-
able Buckeyes side.
We all know how that 
ended.
A win Saturday wouldn’t 
quite be a program-altering 
moment like those would have 
been. It’s hard to say just how 
good this Wisconsin team is 
right now. Two wins by a com-
bined 110-0 certainly hint it’s a 
strong group. Sample size and 
quality of opponent make it 
such that we just don’t know.
There are also, as has been 
well-documented, questions 
about whether this Michigan 
team is ready. The shine is off 
the new offense, and there’s 
little shot at emerging victori-
ous without taking a step for-
ward on that side of the ball. 
The defense has looked up to 
snuff early on, but those two 
performances came against a 
Conference USA team and a 
triple-option side the Wolver-
ines had all summer to prepare 
for.
Going to Madison, stymy-
ing perhaps the best rushing 
attack in the nation, overcom-
ing offensive speed bumps and 
leaving with a win would be a 
whole different animal.
To make a long story short: 
Harbaugh has yet to win a 
game at Michigan he wasn’t 
supposed to win. It is the cen-
tral, most-pressing criticism of 
the era. As a result, he’s never 
won a Big Ten Title and he’s 
never brought his team to the 
College Football Playoff. 
His team can’t do anything 
to alter the latter point on 
Saturday. But in order to get 
there, they have to remedy the 
former point.
Here’s another chance.

Ryan Hayes and the luxury of sitting

Mike Zordich laughed.
“My secret?” he asked. “I don’t 
know if I have a secret.”
Zordich, 
Michigan’s 
cornerbacks coach, had been 
asked 
about 
the 
program’s 
seemingly never-ending churn 
of NFL-caliber players at the 
position 
he 
coaches. 
After 
another year of losing a starter, 
David Long, to the league, the 
Wolverines 
seem 
just 
fine. 
Ambry 
Thomas 
has 
slotted 
in perfectly, and even when it 
seemed like Thomas would miss 
time with colitis, they were fine 
anyway — Vincent Gray, in his 
first extended time, has played 
like a veteran.
The biggest secret Zordich 
may have lies in plain sight, on 
Michigan’s 
247Sports 
page. 
Since 2013 — two years before 
Zordich or Jim Harbaugh got 
hired — the Wolverines have 
recruited the position to near 
perfection. Besides the transition 
class between Brady Hoke and 
Harbaugh, when they didn’t take 
a corner, Michigan’s record of 
getting corners to the next level 
since then is almost 100 percent.
Jourdan Lewis and Jabrill 
Peppers are established players in 
the league. Brandon Watson and 
Channing Stribling have gotten 
practice squad opportunities. 
Long was a third-round pick 
last April, and Lavert Hill will 

almost certainly get his shot this 
April. That encompasses every 
Michigan class of cornerbacks 
from 2013-16; the three classes 
since are still enrolled.
There’s an extent to which 
that’s a self-fulfilling cycle — 
young players come in, sit and 
learn from the older guys and 
by the time those older guys go 
to the NFL, the young ones are 
ready to go. Now that Long and 
Watson are gone, Thomas and 
Gray stepped right into their 
place.
“Just about everybody that 
plays corner ends up being 
really good here,” Harbaugh 
said Monday, “goes on to be pro 
players.”
That’s the kind of cycle every 
position coach dreams of, which 
brings us to the offensive line, 
a position where Michigan has 
been as far away from that cycle 
as can be over the Harbaugh era.
Young players benefit from 
sitting and learning, and their 
development gets hindered from 
getting thrown into the fire too 
early. Nowhere is that more true 
than the offensive line — a fact 
that Michigan exemplified for 
the first few years of Harbaugh’s 
tenure, and a cycle it’s finally 
starting to break.
When the Wolverines were 
struggling 
to 
recruit 
elite 
offensive linemen — Cesar Ruiz 
is the only current starter from 
a five-man 2017 class — guys 
had to play before they were 

ready. When that happened in 
2017, Michigan ranked 117th in 
adjusted sack rate with two of its 
quarterbacks suffering injuries.
The Wolverines endured that 
slog so they could get to now. The 
guys who couldn’t hack it that 
year — Ruiz, Runyan, Bredeson 
and Onwenu among them — are 
now integral starters on a line 
that came into this year as a point 
of confidence. Talk about a new 
scheme all you want. Experience 
goes a long way.
When 
Michigan 
nets 
a 
talented recruit now, it has the 
luxury of sitting him. When Ryan 
Hayes, a redshirt freshman, had 
to play the season’s first two 
games against Middle Tennessee 
and Army, there were no alarm 
bells to sound.
Hayes is the kind of recruit 
who needed developing, a high 
school tight end with a wide 
base and weight to gain. In an 
ideal world he wouldn’t have 
played this year at all, but his 
development seems to have come 
faster than normal. He acquitted 
himself well in those first two 
games, enough that offensive 
line coach Ed Warinner said he’ll 
probably play some snaps against 
Wisconsin even with Runyan 
back from injury.
That’s fine and good. It’s also 
beside the point.
“Playing 
tight 
end 
and 
running routes is not like playing 
O-Line,” Warinner said. “Playing 
O-Line at Michigan. So just 
learning and high repetition of 
the techniques and the calls and 
the job description and the work 
ethic and the culture and all that. 
“Cause that’s different. Being 
a grinder offensive lineman 
is different than being a skill 
guy. That’s a whole different 
culture, a whole different way 
of life, a whole different way of 
practicing. And, so I think it just 
took time.”
It took Hayes a season, and it 
can take longer than that.
Now, Michigan has the luxury 
of waiting.

York, Beecher ready for challenge

Last October, Cam York and 
Johnny Beecher took the ice at 
Yost Ice Arena for the first time.
The 
U.S. 
National 
Team 
Development 
Program’s 
U18 
squad faced the Wolverines in an 
exhibition, and both were in the 
starting lineup for the USNTDP. 
York tallied an assist as his team 
defeated Michigan, 6-3.
Just under a year later, York 
and Beecher are back at Yost — 
this time, as freshmen for the 
Wolverines.
The duo took different paths to 
Michigan, but both are expected 
to hit the ground running and 
contribute right away. In this 
year’s NHL Entry Draft, York 
was drafted No. 14 overall by the 
Philadelphia Flyers and Beecher 
went No. 30 overall to the Boston 
Bruins.
“(They’re) 
obviously 
bright 
spots,” said associate head coach 
Bill Muckalt. “We’re excited about 
them. I think they’re both going to 
add a lot to our team.”
When York came to Yost in 
October, he didn’t know that he’d 
be returning to Ann Arbor the 
following year. At the time, he was 
committed to Boston College, but 
when then-associate head coach 
Greg Brown left the Eagles to be 
an assistant coach in the NHL, 
York began to reconsider his 
decision.
For Michigan’s coaching staff, 
York’s decommitment was an 
opportunity to go after a highly-
ranked prospect and a player 
who could be in the pipeline 
behind former defenseman Quinn 
Hughes.
“We knew he’s obviously a 
high-end offensive player and 
someone that (former assistant 
coach Brian Wiseman) and I and 
(coach Mel Pearson) really were 
interested in,” Muckalt said. “We 
discussed and we thought, ‘You 
know, he’s probably the best player 
on the board at that position.’ We 
were excited to try to recruit him.”
And when York’s team came to 
play the Wolverines, the crowd at 
Yost sealed the decision.
“I think that was kind of the 
cherry on top,” York told The 
Daily last December. “That’s what 

kind of sold me, for sure. Just 
the atmosphere of that place and 
just the way that Michigan fans 
support their team. It’s a special 
place.”
Muckalt and Pearson knew 
Hughes was likely going to depart 
for the Vancouver Canucks — the 
team that drafted him No. 7 overall 
in 2018 — after his sophomore 
season, and York stood out as an 
offensive-minded 
defenseman 
who could fill that spot on the 
left side for the Wolverines. In 
63 games with the USNTDP in 
the 2018-19 season, York tallied 
14 goals and added 51 assists for a 
total of 65 points — a single-season 
program record for a blueliner.
“No question,” Muckalt said 
when asked if York could replace 
Hughes. “I think with his vision 
and his offensive instincts, I think 
it’ll be a — I don’t want to put any 
pressure on him, but I think it’ll be 
a smooth transition.”
While York just decided nine 
months ago to commit to the 
Wolverines, Beecher has known 
for years that Michigan was his 
future home.
The Wolverines first reached 
out 
to 
Beecher 
during 
his 
sophomore year at the Salisbury 
School in Salisbury, Conn. In 
that 
initial 
contact, 
though, 
Beecher learned that then-coach 
Red Berenson would likely be 
retiring at the end of the season, 

so he decided to wait and see 
who the new coach was before 
he went further in the process. 
When Pearson was hired, he and 
Wiseman paid a visit to Beecher 
and he was sold.
Through 
two 
successful 
years at the USNTDP, Beecher’s 
commitment never wavered. Now 
that he’s on campus, the coaching 
staff is hopeful that he’ll continue 
to grow as a player and realize his 
potential.
“(Beecher 
has 
high-level) 
skating ability and he can shoot 
the puck,” Muckalt said. “I think 
he’s going to be a tremendous asset 
in a lot of areas, and I think he’s 
just scratching the surface of the 
player that he can become.”
For the talented duo, the 
biggest challenge in adjusting to 
college hockey will be joining a 
team that had a difficult season 
last year. Michigan won just 13 of 
its 36 games last season, while the 
USNTDP squad won 47 of 63.
But Beecher is clearly ready for 
the challenge of turning around a 
struggling team.
“I think the energy is really 
high in the locker room right 
now,” Beecher said. “And I think 
everybody’s excited. I mean, we 
know the talent that we have, and 
I think we’re all pretty eager to 
get started. I think it’s going to be 
a great season. Can’t wait for the 
first game to come.”

There 
isn’t 
much 
to 
remember about 2006. It was 
a year of Razor scooters and 
Dum Dums and multiplication 
tables. I was in second grade, 
where our hottest topics were 
who was seen holding hands 
on the playground, or what 
treats we were bringing in for 
our birthdays. We certainly 
weren’t talking about scientific 
discoveries, 
intergalactic 
developments or the terrifying 
depths of the universe. That 
is, of course, until it was 
announced that Pluto would no 
longer be considered a planet.
This plunged our narrow 
halls into despair. I don’t know 
why I took this news so hard. 
My teacher told me I was at a 
fifth grade reading level and 
I had just gotten a life-sized 
stuffed dog for Christmas, so 
things were going pretty well. 
But this news about Pluto — 
it rocked me. It shook me to 
my Lisa Frank-clad core. I 
remember little about that year, 
but I do remember the day Pluto 
was demoted.
For 
those 
who 
don’t, 
some background: Pluto was 
discovered on Feb. 18, 1930 
at the Lowell Observatory in 
Flagstaff, Ariz. by astronomer 
Clyde W. Tombaugh. According 
to a website for the Library of 
Congress that looks straight out 
of the year 1993, the era during 
which Pluto was discovered 
was one of “intense planet 
hunting.” Hardcore. The name 
“Pluto,” later the name of a 
beloved Disney pet, was actually 
proposed by an 11-year-old girl 
from Oxford named Venetia 
Burney who was interested in 
mythology. To thank her for a 
name that would literally be 
used for the rest of time, Burney 
was awarded five pounds.

Such a great story, right? Well, 
astronomers don’t care about 
the story, they care about the 
facts. And, in 2006, the fact was 
that Pluto could no longer be 
considered a planet. Instead, the 
International Astronomy Union 
(IAU) downgraded it to a dwarf 
planet. To be a full-blown planet 
a mass needs to: 1) Orbit around 
the Sun 2) Have sufficient 
mass to assume hydrostatic 
equilibrium (a nearly round 
shape) and 3) Have a “cleared 
neighborhood” around its orbit. 
Apparently, 
Pluto 
also 
has 
annoying neighbors that hover 
around it, because the third 
criteria is where it lost out.
That’s a lot of science for 
me to understand now, so I 
certainly didn’t understand it 
during the year “A Bad Case of 
Stripes” caused me to become a 
juvenile hypochondriac. What 
I understood was suddenly my 
time spent memorizing the 
nine planets was wasted — all 
the acronyms, the solar system 
dioramas, the crudely colored-
in circles. Why had we even 
spent so much time learning 
about planets? Was it all a 
waste? A facade of happiness to 
be ripped apart when some old 
men decide a planet just wasn’t 
good enough anymore?
In hindsight, I think our 
little 
second 
grade 
hearts 
were broken because we truly 
did love Pluto. It was every 
student’s favorite planet — the 
underdog, the little guy. Oh you 
like Jupiter, Sarah? We get it, 
your dad’s a broker at Meryll 
Lynch. Your favorite planet is 
Saturn, Jason? No one cares 
that you’re in accelerated math. 
Pluto was the planet for the rest 
of us, the ones with no rings, no 
red storm, no semblance of life. 
When Pluto was told it wasn’t 
good enough, we were told we 
weren’t good enough. Everyone 
always says kids are the future, 
the next generation will change 

the world — how could we do 
that when no one will respect 
us?
It wasn’t just the second 
graders, though. The world felt 
the effects of the diminished 
Pluto. Just in the past month, 13 
years since the tragedy of Pluto, 
there 
have 
been 
numerous 
articles about just how bad 
everybody wants Pluto to be a 
planet again. We just want it 
to be happy, to be recognized 
again, to stand along the big 
boys of the Milky Way.
Honestly, I think all of us see 
a little bit of Pluto within us. 
Yeah, it sounds silly to care so 
much about an insentient rock, 
but this stuff hits home. We’ve 
all been told we’re not good 
enough, and if an entire planet 
can be ousted, so can we. I don’t 
care what the IAU says, they 
can’t tell us how to see Pluto, no 
matter what fancy degrees they 
have or how many telescopes 
they own. For Venetia Burney, 
for heartbroken second graders 
and for NASA administrators 
that can’t let things go, there 
will always be Pluto. And for 
Pluto, there will always be those 
who never give up on it.

In defense of puny Pluto

B-SIDE: FOR THE SAKE OF PLUTO

The first few bars of the theme 
music for “Star Trek: The Next 
Generation” sounds more like 
ambient music at a yoga retreat 
than the introduction to an ’80s 
imagination of the year 2364. Then 
things speed up, soaring into a 
marching band-esque crescendo, 
and it’s clear: This is the future. 
The Star Trek franchise includes 
12 movies, eight television shows, 
two theme park attractions, two 
magazines, about 850 novels and 
17 series of comic books. The 
cultural impact of the show can’t 
be understated — it’s where we 
got “live long and prosper,” “beam 
me up, Scotty” and “make it so.” 
It inspired “Galaxy Quest” and 
“Futurama,” a few notable scenes 
in the music video for Eminem’s 
“We Made You” and even a 2010 
training video made by the Internal 
Revenue Service.
The franchise garners the kind 
of obsession that’s endearingly 
embarrassing: 
flashing 
the 
Vulcan 
hand 
salute, 
having 
intimate knowledge of Klingon 
chess, making detailed costumes 
for conventions. “Trekkie” has 
become cultural shorthand for 
a very specific kind of fixation. 
It suggests, with a patronizing 
wink, that wanting to be part of 
the world of “Star Trek” requires a 
mix of social isolation and naiveté. 
Instead I think it requires hope, or a 
profound lack of it. 
At the height of my Star Trek 
fandom, I was never the kind of 
enthusiast who found themselves 
mired in the minutiae of the show. 
Instead, it was the big picture that 

I latched onto. I watched “Star 
Trek: The Next Generation” with 
my mom when I was in middle 
school; we liked the cleanliness of 
the Starship Enterprise and the 
grand, sweeping views of planets 
and stars. The world of the show 
(an immense silver vessel, aliens 
with ridged foreheads) seemed 
very far away from the setting and 
context of my life at the time: our 
little row home in Philadelphia, 
homemade pumpkin ice cream, 
math homework, forgetting to 
hang my suit up to dry before swim 
practice. Now, rewatching the 
show, the associations have become 
reverse engineered. “Star Trek” is 
inextricable from the way it felt to 
be fourteen and think the future 
could contain absolutely anything. 
According 
to 
“Star 
Trek,” 
everything we’re worried about 
right now will be OK. There will 
be other things that go wrong — a 
species intent on taking over the 
universe, 
arguments 
between 
factions of aliens — but these 
concerns are foreign enough that 
they’re intriguing rather than 
scary. The show depicts its fair 
share of pain and suffering, but 
usually it’s the aliens who suffer in 
any permanent way; when humans 
do, it’s an aberration from the new 
normal that’s been created. By the 
time the Enterprise is exploring 
new worlds, we’ve eliminated 
climate 
change, 
war, 
disease, 
xenophobia and sexism. On Earth, 
everything is as it should be. 
In the rest of the universe, 
though, these things still exist, and 
nearly every conflict on the series 
involves starship crews becoming 
entangled 
with 
random 
and 
calculated unfairness, cruelty and 
moral complication. We get Klingon 

in-fighting, 
alien 
merchants 
selling slaves, a civilization about 
to be decimated by its dying star. 
“Star Trek: The Next Generation” 
is especially prone to depicting 
easily-recognizable 
versions 
of 
real quandaries. The characters 
encounter everything from sex 
trafficking to territorial disputes 
on distant planets, and they’re 
forced to confront moral codes 
that exaggerate the ironies and 
falsehoods of our own beliefs.
Familiar 
dramas 
play 
out: 
Apartheid is displaced onto a 
matriarchal society in “Angel One,” 
and the Israel-Palestine conflict 
plays out with a group of alien 
separatists in “The High Ground.” 
Here lies the ethical problem with 
“Star Trek,” and also the thing that 
is so deliciously attractive about it. 
Every earthly dilemma has been 
outsourced to an alien species, 
and we get to be the arbiters of 
goodness, the agents of scientific 
reason. Who wouldn’t want to buy 
into this vision of the future?
When I was in middle school 
and 
watching 
“Star 
Trek” 
I 
imagined we were moving closer 
toward the show’s version of the 
future: 
egalitarian, 
democratic, 
creative. Now when I watch the 
show, I vacillate between hope and 
escapism. I want to believe that 
“Star Trek” is predictive of how 
things will turn out for humanity. 
I want us to wander the universe in 
brightly colored uniforms, listening 
to operas sung by sentient robots. I 
hope we will find our way to peace. 
But if that’s not what the future 
holds, if it’s more war and injustice 
and greed that we’re headed for, 
then all I want is to watch Captain 
Picard hold court on the bridge one 
more time.

There’s something so magical about the night sky. Yes, 
the millions of glowing balls of fire above our heads, so 
far away that we perceive them as only twinkles in a sea of 
darkness, are astounding to think about. And yes, there’s no 
act more humbling than staring into space and comparing 
yourself to the scale of the universe. But the true gift of the 
night sky lies in something much harder to articulate: the 
magic of the unknown.
Just like our expansive oceans, with points deeper than 
Earth’s tallest mountains above sea level, we know very 
little about outer space. The vast majority of space matter is 
unidentified; we know it’s there based on its gravitational 
pull on other matter, but we can’t see it with our eyes. This 
dark matter is second only to dark energy, which is causing 
the universe to accelerate in its expansion, a forward 
feedback loop with its feet permanently off the brakes. Yet 
here we are, nice and cozy on our Earth, rarely stopping to 
gaze up into the night sky and wonder about everything that 
remains to be discovered.

In bustling Ann Arbor, though, looking up 
into the sky will reward you with a fuzzy haze 
of gray. Between lamp posts on South University, 
streetlights on State Street and the glow from 
buildings bordering the Diag, light pollution 
blocks the gems of the sky so effectively that it’s 
hard to even make out what you’re missing. But 
I’m always looking, trying to catch a glimpse. 
Whether on a bright fall afternoon, cloud-
covered, misty day or warm summer night, my 
first instinct upon stepping outside is to gaze up, 
take a deep breath and smile in solitude. To know 
that it’s just you and that beckoning expanse 
above, if only for a moment, is the best form of 
therapy. 
Growing up in the Metro Detroit area has given 
me very few chances to see the night sky in all its 
glory without ambient light washing everything 
out. The most memorable time happened to be two 
weeks ago, in the depths of Acadia National Park 
in Mount Desert Island, Maine. At 8 p.m., I sat wiped-out 
in the backseat of my family’s rental car, my legs quaking 
slightly from trekking all day and my Circadian clock 
disoriented by the early sunsets on the eastern-most state of 
the East Coast. The endorphins from earlier in the 
day had faded away, leaving me with an empty but 
peaceful feeling in my stomach, something close 
to gratitude for being alive, though I couldn’t 
place my finger on the emotion at the time. 
Our destination? Sand Beach in the heart of 
Acadia, always populated by tourists and locals 
alike. New pairs of feet continually trampled the 
sand below, only to have their footprints washed 
away by the roaring Atlantic in an instant. 
Sand is a deceiving name: Shell fragments 
make up the majority of the soft earth, teeming 
microorganisms are littered throughout the rest. 
During the day, one can clearly make out the 
looming granite rocks rising on either side of 
the sand stretch, forming a small bay with calm 
waters. At night, it’s a whole different story. 
The wooden steps felt foreign under my feet as I 
descended in the darkness: My feet had forgotten 
that I’d taken the same path the day before in 

broad, piercing daylight. Everywhere I looked was shrouded 
with intense darkness. The only color I could make out was 
jet black, putting even the poignant black of ink cartridges 
to shame. We stumbled onto the beach, faintly able to make 
out the mound of people in the distance. Everyone else had 
brought a blanket, some were cuddling under sleeping bags. 
We sat on the bare sand, letting it fill our shoes and seep 
through the gaps in our clothes. If you’re going to stargaze 
on the beach, best to do it right, no boundaries necessary. 
There was light, just not the kind one might expect. All I 
had to do was look up and the night sky shone upon me, glad 
that my eyes had finally found its destination. Millions of 
stars danced in the night, teasing me, inviting me to dance 
with them. The broad band of the Milky Way stretched from 
horizon to horizon, home to millions of stars, planets and us, 
the Earth. Park rangers pointed out dozens of constellations 
smiling down at us. I smiled back up at them. This world has 
always been there, waiting for the right moment, the right 
place, to show itself. Second only to the total solar eclipse 
of 2017, I’d never beheld anything like it. 
I can only grasp at memories of that night, close my eyes 
and let the stars that fill my mind push all my lingering 
thoughts away. Whenever I get the chance to gaze again, I 
know they’ll be waiting.

Space. The final frontier. The place where 
Star Wars are fought, odysseys are traveled, 
and 
extra 
terrestrials 
must 
inevitably 
return. Space has fascinated filmmakers and 
audiences alike for generations. More than 
50 years after the moon landing, it is still as 
much of an unknown to us now as it was to 
us then. Is there life beyond this world? Are 
we alone on the vast plane of existence? Or is 
there a threat still to come from above? What 
is it about space that is so enthralling and 
mystifying?
Despite our technological advancement 
over the past five decades, audiences are still 
as obsessed with space as they’ve ever been. 
This year alone, multiple major blockbusters 
have featured threats from above as their 
primary source of conflict.
“Avengers: 
Endgame” 
saw 
the 
entire 
universe 
come 
under 
threat 
from 
an 
ubervillain from another world, a being so 
powerful that us mortals could scarcely 
comprehend the force that he could wield. 
“Godzilla: King of the Monsters” saw a space-
powered King Ghidorah who fell from the 
heavens in the time before time. “Captain 
Marvel,” “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” 
“Ad Astra” ... all of these films prominently 
feature space as a central component of their 
narrative. Why is it that out of the probable 
five highest grossing films of the year, three 
of them will be about space? 
Human beings are obsessed with the 
unknown. They fear it, they sometimes crave 
it, but most of all they don’t understand it. 
Besides death, space is the greatest unknown 
there is. In some ways it is the ultimate 
mystery. Despite decades of research, there is 
still so much we do not know. Chicken Little 
once said the sky was falling, and while no 
one believed him then, audiences can’t stop 
believing it now. 
Besides the mystery of it all, space is 
just cool. Aliens, laser swords, spaceships, 
lightspeed, other worlds, strange encounters 
— I mean what’s not to like? Science fiction 
has everything that fantasy has, but with the 
moral ambiguity and difficult that comes 
with a more complicated setting. Not to say 
fantasy cannot be complicated, but over the 
course of genre history, it is science fiction 
that has been known as the more thought 
provoking of the two. “Star Trek,” “Dune,” 
“2001 A Space Odyssey,” ... all of these pieces 
are centered around who we are, where we’ve 
been, and where we are going. By pitting 

humanity against the upper limits of what is 
possible and what is known, storytellers are 
able to use space to reflect back on what truly 
makes us human. Space allows us as a society 
to understand who we are by comparing us to 
what we are not. We are not super powered 
beings from other worlds, blowing up Death 
Stars and going where no man has ever gone 
before. But by taking a look at what the 
future could possibly hold, we give society 
something to strive towards and something 
to avoid.
If space is truly the final frontier, than it is 
the last and greatest challenge that mankind 
must face. I think there is a real possibility 
that deep down a lot of people on this planet 
inherently know that while our species 
was born on earth, we were never meant to 
die here. Space fascinates us because the 
definition of space is the absence of something 
else. That absence gives way to unlimited 
possibility. Unlimited possibility for telling 
stories, unlimited possibility for what is out 
there and unlimited possibility for a world 
that is seemingly growing smaller every day.

looming threat in the sky

B-SIDE: FILM NOTEBOOK

The 2017 eclipse was a unique point in the 
American consciousness. Large amounts of people 
simultaneously pondered their existence relative 
to the cosmos. It was a singular moment given that 
people usually only confront their size in proportion 
to a mundane scale: a shelf they’re trying to reach 
or a six-foot height preference on Tinder. I was 
struck by the fragile self-importance of my problems 
in comparison to the universe beyond, and I think 
others were too. But the only serious discussion of 
our relative size I saw was in a flat-earther Facebook 
group. They were more concerned with how NASA 
managed to fake such a large-scale event. 
I shouldn’t have been surprised. Bringing it up at 
the water cooler isn’t natural and probably won’t do 
anything to quell the existential anxiety.
Literature is a better place to discuss such matters. 
Its longform nature allows us to explore concepts 
that would be too difficult otherwise. But what 
exactly makes the universe scary, and how should 
literature respond? Our insect-like proportions to 
outer space can be daunting, but I don’t think size 
alone can explain the fear. There’s something about 
the vast, uncaring emptiness that makes humans 
feel insignificant. And with good reason.
What do even the best pieces of writing signify 
when held up next to the vast expanse of nothing 
around us? Thinking about such things only makes 
the stories we tell each other seem less relevant. 
These anxieties are easy to ignore when engrossed 
in a good story — we’re usually thinking about our 
characters existing in a specific setting, not about 
the oblivion surrounding that environment.
Moreover, space implies limits for fully controlling 
our own experiences. The earth is part of a large 
and uncaring universe, and we can’t completely 
control our own environment. Asteroids are one 
manifestation of this anxiety. Even the small things 
humans can build will be ripped apart by each other, 
or a decaying earth, or, ultimately, heat death. Can 
we just ignore this? People walk indoors, and the 
outside world feels like a different reality entirely, 
separated by more than just walls. It’s easy to have 
a similar feeling about our place in the universe. 
Maybe this is good. We can focus on solving the 
problems we have control over. But there has to be 
some way to adapt our stories to respond healthily.

One typical response in literature is fantasies of 
new colonialism. It’s comforting to some to grid and 
map the intergalactic space, and then to colonize it. 
The Cold War pushed American manifest destiny 
upward. Perhaps if we build enough floating space 
Walmarts, we can fill up the vast unknown with 
something we understand. Spending your entire 
free time imagining a Chili’s in the Kuiper belt has 
some negative implications, believe it or not. For 
one, it’s now easier to imagine geo-engineering a 
new environment on Mars, as in Andy Weir’s “The 
Martian,” than saving our own.
Other stories in literature try to focus on the 
horror. For many, this means aliens. Other writers 
fill the dark void ineffably giant H.P.-Lovecraftian 
monsters. This makes sense: When presented with 
nothing, we’re constantly scanning and looking 
for something we can understand. Like being a 
kid and running to the bed after turning out the 
lights, there’s something we don’t trust about blank 
nothingness. But this may not confront space’s 
void directly. Humans can understand the horror 
of monsters. We’re programmed to fear animals 
that can kill us. Understanding our hypothetical 
relationship to these monsters does not truly explore 
why we’re afraid of nothingness, and what we can 
do about it.
Our fears about space aren’t tangible. Translating 
those fears to identifiable monsters means we 
can’t honestly face less concrete horrors. Comedy 
is another fallback. Books like “The Hitchhiker’s 
Guide To The Galaxy” laugh off the absurdity of the 
void. This may be just another type of deflection. 
Imaging the answer to life as 42 is simply a way 
of short-circuiting thinking about the terror of 
meaninglessness. 
Even if most literature isn’t genuinely looking in 
the face of our reality, does that matter? We only 
have so much time on this earth, and there’s more 
than enough to worry about without trying to 
confront large existential problems. Most people are 
just worrying about how to make ends meet. 
Perhaps there is no right answer. Facing absurdity 
shouldn’t come at the cost of happiness. Some 
terrors aren’t worth considering under certain 
circumstances, even if they’re right. If you found 
evidence for heaven not existing, you wouldn’t 
present it to a mom at her son’s funeral. Ignoring 
existential absurdity you have no control over isn’t 
necessarily cowardly. Picking your battles is just one 
part of coping with the human experience. 

Facing absurdity through lit

B-SIDE: BOOKS NOTEBOOK

When we think of space, astrology and the galaxy, 
we rarely think of the fashion industry and style. 
However, the truth is that the concepts of space 
influence fashion in a multifaceted manner, whether 
consciously or not. This hidden affair between the 
two worlds has probably been blossoming since the 
day we landed on the moon. We can witness how 
the mark of the space was introduced via more 
geometric shapes and silhouettes on the runway 
by designers such as Andre Courreges or Emilio 
Pucci. Some began to shift to fabrics like PVC that 
were inspired by 
space suits; other 
designs 
became 
more 
utilitarian 
as a whole. The 
residue influence 
was subtle but was 
still undeniable. 
Even 
decades 
later, 
designers 
are 
continually 
drawing 
from 
the 
mystery 
of 
the space and the adventure that it promises. 
Take the Chanel Fall/Winter 2017-18 collection. 
Set against the backdrop of a rocket with models 
floating down the ramp in metallic hues and 
futuristic accessories, the show is an example of 
fashion’s continual fascination with the galaxy. 
In some ways, space gave birth to the futuristic 
style that has become commonplace today, be it 
through oversized, rectangular glasses or super 
reflective jackets. Coach’s Pre-Fall Collection in 
2017 captured the sentiment of exploring beyond 
the given and achieving the impossible, reflected 
in their simple but direct prints on their garments 
and their marketing campaign. Some other huge 
collaborations include NASA X Vans or Nike’s 

Mars collection. 
Space has lent its artistic potential to everyday 
style and ways of thinking about fashion. If you 
were to walk down any crowded street, you would 
find someone wearing a shift that jokes about 
their sun sign, dainty pendants in the shape of 
constellations or even t-shirts that don the NASA 
logo. 
The solar system goes beyond design as well. 
Bloggers such as STARtorialist dedicate their time 
to sharing the interaction of all things fashion, 
space and science. Similarly, publications such 
as Harper’s Bazaar or Her Campus often write 
about how to dress according to your “star sign,” 
or zodiac sign, and what that sign means for your 
personal style.
The interaction 
between fashion 
and space should 
not be surprising. 
Fashion is often 
pigeonholed and 
understood 
to 
only be what is 
visible 
on 
the 
surface, 
when 
in reality it is so 
much more than 
that. Similarly, astronomy is a way of thinking, 
it’s a belief that some events are beyond control 
and exert influence over others that we directly 
do control. This affair is more like two ways of 
thinking coming together and morphing into a 
common creative outlet. Moreover, both realms 
take into consideration things like patterns but 
apply them differently. To fashion, patterns are 
pertinent to defining a print or changing the 
entire look, while for astronomy and the science of 
space, patterns help predict. In the same manner, 
structure, forms and colors are pivotal to the 
functioning of each of these realms. Maybe that’s 
why intergalactic themes in the fashion industry 
have proven to be a huge success.

while our species was

were never meant to 
die here


Most children go through 
the phase of obsession with 
space. Whether they want to 
be an astronaut, build a rocket 
ship or study the stars in their 
backyard, we all have this 
innate desire to examine the 
unknown. Alexander Cucos 
was no exception. 
Cucos’s interest in space 
started when he was a child, 
as many of us can relate to. In 
an interview with The Daily, 
Cucos shared that “I’ve always 
been 
interested 
in 
planes 
and rockets and that sort of 
thing, but what little kid isn’t 
right?” But he never thought 
he could make a career out 
of his interest until he got to 
high school. “I got this PC 
game, Kerbal Space Program. I 
taught myself some super basic 
orbital 
mechanics, 
transfer 
maneuvers between planets 
and that sort of thing, from 
Wikipedia in order to play it,” 
said Cucos. “I thought ‘Huh, 
I could totally do this for the 
rest of my life.’”
Now he is an aerospace 
engineering student at the 
University, set to graduate 
in 2020. His education at the 
University has allowed him to 
explore many different facets 
of aerospace. “We have to 
learn a little bit about circuit 
design, 
coding, 
structural 
analysis, control theory, and, 
of 
course, 
aerodynamics,” 
Cucos 
said. 
“It’s 
basically 
systems engineering with a 
focus on things that fly.”
There is a wide variety of 
classes offered to aerospace 
majors, as they can focus on 
one of two tracks: aeronautics, 
the study of aircrafts, and 
astronautics, 
the 
study 
of 
spacecrafts. They can take 
everything from a hoverboard 
design class to pilot training 
classes. “I honestly think my 
favorite class so far has been 
my 300-level Aerodynamics 
class,” Cucos said. “It’s super 
cool to be able to take any 
shape you want, and use math 
to determine exactly how the 
flow moves around it, and 
what kind of forces are applied 

to it. It kinda sounds geeky, I 
know, but I think that stuff is 
so cool.”
The 
opportunities 
his 
education gives him span a 
wide range of careers. “You can 
work for the military on fighter 
aircraft or missiles; you can 
work for NASA on spacecraft 
operation, orbital mechanics 
or trajectory analysis; you can 
design 
commercial 
aircraft 
with a company like Boeing 
or Airbus; you can go over 
to a company like ULA and 
design rockets; or you can 
work on aerospace propulsion 
systems, jets, rockets, electric 
thrusters, that sort of thing,” 
Cucos 
explained. 
“There’s 
definitely 
something 
for 
everybody.”
This past summer, he had 
the opportunity to intern at 
a company in Arizona called 
Raytheon that primarily builds 
missiles for the government. 
Aside from a distaste for the 
climate, Cucos found the job 
fascinating. “I was working on 
the Modeling, Simulation and 
Analysis team, which basically 
means I was coding holistic 
software to simulate the entire 
use cycle of the product” said 
Cucos. “I can’t really say a 

whole lot more than that, 
because, you know, defense 
contractor and all that, but 
it was a very interesting 
experience overall.”
With this experience under 
his belt, Cucos has big dreams 
for after college. “My dream is 
to work at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL). They are 
responsible for designing and 
building all of the spacecraft 
that NASA uses, such as 
satellites, deep-space probes, 
and 
landers/rovers,” 
Cucos 
said. “Specifically, I would love 
to work on extraterrestrial, 
endo-atmospheric 
vehicles, 
things 
that 
fly 
in 
the 
atmosphere of other celestial 
bodies.”
Projects like these may seem 
inaccessible to the public, but 
aerospace engineering has so 
much importance in everyday 
life. “There are the obvious big 
things, like the GPS satellites 
that power your navigation 
app, or the communications 
satellites that let you watch 
a rugby game in the UK from 
your house,” Cucos elaborated, 
“but one of the beauties about 
NASA is that they often fund 
the things that nobody else 
wants to. NASA funding paid 
for everything from Velcro to 
solar panels. NASA funded the 
invention of the digital image 
sensor, which is the technology 
found in every smartphone 
camera. Every time you use 
Snapchat? You’re using space-
grade technology!”
What makes the study of 
space so special to Cucos is 
the sense of unity it brings 
to 
everyone. 
“Space 
is 
dangerous and exciting to 
everyone,” Cucos exclaimed. 
“Space 
doesn’t 
care 
what 
your nationality is, or what 
your religion is; if you mess 
up, it will kill you. It takes 
all of us working together to 
go to space and achieve great 
things.” Sharing a fascination 
with space helps bring us 
together as a species. Whether 
it’s working cross continent 
to create a space station or 
stargazing with friends, space 
unites us in a way that is out of 
this world.

DEF JAM RECORDINGS / SUE KWON

Music has always had an 
obsession with space. From 
David Bowie’s Major Tom 
to 
Soundgarden’s 
“Black 
Hole Sun” to even Claude 
Debussy’s “Clair de Lune,” 
the stars and what lies beyond 
is a subject of fascination 
and 
admiration 
for 
many 
musicians. Space is a mystery 
to all of us, including those 
who know it well. With every 
passing day we learn more 
about the fringes of our 
solar system and everything 
else in the night sky. It’s 
understandable that so many 
people 
have 
created 
art 
based on the worlds outside 
our own. 
But things have changed 
since 
Debussy 
wrote 
his 
quintessential composition, 
a time when people looked 
at the sky without thinking 
about actually going there. In 
the age of missiles and SpaceX 
and people selling seats on 
luxury shuttles, space means 
something different. It’s a 
bigger expanse, one we can 
potentially 
see 
ourselves 
visiting. Our modern world 
extends beyond the Earth 
itself in so many ways — 
in 
big 
data, 
broadband 
transmission, 
Bluetooth, 
radio, everything in between 
— so why would we anchor 
our artistic understanding 
of 
space 
to 
the 
easily-
swallowable? 
Now 
this, 
my 
friends, 
is why the Beastie Boys’s 
“Intergalactic” 
is 
a 
song 
that makes the most sense 
for space as we know it 
today. Released in 1998 on 
the 
group’s 
fifth 
record 
and arguably most artistic 
interpretation of frat-boy-
rap, Hello Nasty, the song 
finally made it out after 
being shelved for previous 
releases. It’s a crazy song, 
combining 
a 
crunched, 
synthesized 
chorus 
with 
arrogant 
and 
hilarious 
verses. From the moment the 

track begins with a repeated 
“Intergalactic, 
planetary, 
planetary, intergalactic,” the 
listener knows they’re in for 
something special. 
The 
sheer 
loudness 
of 
“Intergalactic” mirrors the 
saturation 
of 
enthusiasm 
around 
space 
travel 
and 
exploration; 
it 
parallels 
the craziness of eccentric 
billionaires like Elon Musk 
and 
their 
idiosyncrasies 
perfectly. Each beat of the 
drum-machine instrumental, 
complete with samples from 
both Rachmaninoff and The 
Jazz Crusaders, fills your 
brain completely, forcing out 
all other thoughts for a full 
acceptance of the groove. 
You feel like you’re being 
beamed somewhere, and not 
somewhere you’re sure you 
want to go. But still, the ride 
is a whole lot of fun.
The Beasties even sample 
themselves halfway through 
the song, specifically “The 
New Style” off Licensed to 
Ill. “Beastie Boys known to 
let the beat / mmmMMM… 
drop!” 
they 
shout, 
and 
anyone listening can’t help 
but sing along. The thing 
that made the Beastie Boys 
popular in the first place — 

and gave “Intergalactic” a 
Grammy in 1999 for Best Rap 
Performance by a Group — 
is their sheer brashness. If 
anything could connect so 
truthfully with the space 
economy of today, it’s that. 
They simultaneously make 
fun of themselves and hype 
themselves 
up, 
throwing 
shoutouts to producer Mario 
Caldato and each member in 
turn. It’s pure, unadulterated 
energy in song form, with a 
beat fit to blast off. 
So if you’re itching to 
see the stars, annoyed with 
the 
Elon 
Musk-Grimes-
Azealia Banks love triangle 
or really just love Saturn, 
“Intergalactic” is a perfect 
song for you. The track is 
spacey, yes, but it’s also 
funny, angry and everything 
in between. It captures the 
frenzy of its original Y2K 
era in addition to our own, 
encapsulating the frenzied 
overstimulation of each big-
boom decade with grace and, 
of course, synthesizers. Hell, 
put on the whole album if 
you’re really feeling it — the 
nastiness of our time is so 
deep you might as well say 
hello to it. You might even 
find yourself in orbit. 

Blasting off into orbit with
the Beastie Boys, of course

If you’ve been on the internet anytime within the past five years, then there’s no way you’ve 
avoided hearing someone say “Mercury’s in retrograde” or “I went on a date with this guy but 
our signs aren’t compatible.” Horoscopes and astrology have violently infiltrated modern-day 
culture from out of thin air, and like the flu at the beginning of the school year, it just won’t 
go away. I don’t remember when I first saw the explosion of astrological jargon and symbols 
on my discover page on Instagram, and I certainly haven’t had the chance to question why so 
many people have bought into it until now. Why has it made its controversial return? Can we 
call it a comeback? Does anyone actually believe in it unironically? Is it all just a distraction 
imposed by the government to avert our gaze from the impending hunger war? 
A quick disclaimer: I’m 18 years old. This means I grew up with the prevalence of social 
media, so I have little experience with horoscopes in print media, like in the trades or Sunday 
paper. Some people probably checked their daily horoscope without the ease of technology, 
but not anyone I know. Maybe it’s not really a comeback so much as it is proof of how we only 
know what we see, and right now, we only see anything that’s on social media. 
Nobody knows exactly where astrology came from, but turning to the stars has always been 
a common practice for civilizations to explain the purpose of our existence and guide them 
throughout life. Some societies attributed the state of the stars to explain the bad times their 
civilization was having, others as a calendar or a compass. Up until science showed us that 
stars are just exploding balls of gas, we used the stars to survive and answer the timeless 
question of “Why are we here?” In a sense, we still use astrology to do this. 
The Greeks, Babylonians and Romans are credited with making the 12 signs we know today: 
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius 
and Pisces. They were based off of when it seemed like the sun passed through each respective 
constellation, and most of the constellations represented cute little animals, which is where 
most of the symbols come from — except for Libra, which has a scale as its symbol that makes 
it difficult for companies to market on t-shirts and phone cases. 
It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly why this belief system died down, but it’s easy to make a few 
educated guesses. At some point throughout humanity’s short history, the civilizations that 
developed this belief system died out, science and experimentation became a more popular 
method of explaining the way the world is, and Christian belief systems became a fashionable 
and sometimes mandatory belief system. Christianity also isn’t exactly a big fan of astrology. 
Let’s get into the dissection of astrology’s miraculous comeback. Ever since “modern” social 
media came around in circa 2004 (Facebook and Instagram), astrology has been unavoidable 
and admittedly, tempting to buy into. Hundreds of social media accounts are dedicated 
to pumping out half-assed, vague and sometimes contradictory daily horoscopes, yet still 
manage to earn millions of followers. If you’re a cynic, you’ll wonder who’s following these 
stupid accounts that claim to predict what your lucky days are each month and categorize 
what the perfect break-up song is for each sign. But if you’re someone like me, who at some 
point in early high school bought into these accounts, you’ll kind of get it. And if you’re 
feeling kind of brave, you’d be willing to explain the temptation with a necessary amount of 
shame. 
Since everything is so accessible, once you go down the horoscope path, the natural next 

step is to download an app like Co—star, which has a 4.9 rating (out of 65.8k ratings) on 
the App Store. Although I’ve never used it, the fact that it claims to be “powered by AI that 
merges NASA data with the insight of human astrologers” on its about page makes it appear 
credible and more powerful than it really is. You’re asked to enter your birth date, time and 
place so the app can find the exact alignment the stars were in when you were born to develop 
a comprehensive astrological profile. It’s oddly specific, and an issue regarding occasionally 
creepy push notifications has gained attention for the app, as it would send “day at a glance” 
pushes that said alarming things like “your nervous energy won’t be especially useful today.” 
Using artificial intelligence to cater to individual needs helps the messages seem targeted 
toward personal issues, which can be an issue for the impressionable who might use the app 
to decide the course of their day.
That’s why astrology is especially tempting to teenagers. Let’s say you’re a young, 
undeveloped, middle-to-high schooler, and you’re at the peak of teenage angst. If you have 
social media, what are you going to use it for apart from an unhealthy standard of comparison? 
That’s where the discover page comes into play. If the algorithm’s doing its job right, a zodiac 
post will pop up and you’ll think “that’s exactly like me.” From there, you’ll spiral into a 
rabbit hole of relatable posts and zodiac horoscopes. I certainly remember a time where I 
would screenshot horoscope posts that talk about how stubborn Tauruses are and send it to 
my Taurus friend when she was willfully ignoring my advice, mostly jokingly, but also to be 
like, “See? Even the horoscope thinks so.” 
But I think the most curious thing to see is the millennial generation (who technically 
range from 23 to around 38 now) really believe in astrology and incorporate it into their 
everyday life. The cynic in me has a tendency to believe that these “full-grown” adults have 
an external locus of control and use astrology to avoid taking accountability in their everyday 
life. After all, how easy is it to say that you and your significant other broke up because 
you’re an Aries and they’re a Capricorn? Or that your upper twenties were tumultuous and 
destructive because it was time for Saturn’s return? It can make bad events make seem more 
palatable, but it can also give people an excuse to be destructive and avoidant. If you’re a 
cynic, then astrology seems like a way out. But we’re not here to be cynical. Like astrology, 
we’re here to search for explanations. 
There are belief systems everywhere that we use to grasp universal phenomena, because 
we have a need to know. A need to know if the earth revolves around the sun or vice versa, a 
need to know that we’re never really touching anything because our atoms are just vibrating 
against each other, a need to know why ice cream just tastes so good when you’re sad. You 
can probably find scientific evidence for any one of these things, but even science, like all 
belief systems, can be inaccurate. Maybe science has a stronger basis in facts and research, 
but there’s so many times that this “evidence” has been disproven, corrupt or biased. So if you 
think about it like that, then believing in astrology doesn’t seem all that crazy.
Zodiacs have simply come back at the perfect time, a time where relatable content and 
“Which type of bread are you?” quizzes have hit peak pop culture. We’re in an era of 
categorization — a time when people yearn to be part of a group and hear more about who 
they are and who they could be. It helps us feel less alone, less like confused specks in a sea 
of change and humanity. It can go too far, but in moderation, astrology isn’t so bad. If your 
friend refuses to leave the house because her horoscope isn’t good, then it’s gone a bit too far. 
But otherwise, scroll away. And be careful — the next Mercury retrograde is from Oct. 31 to 
Nov. 20.

In retrograde: Musings on astrology’s cosmic comeback

‘Graveyard’

Halsey

Capitol Records

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘GRAVEYARD’

Halsey trades out her classic 
EDM-pop mystique for a darker 
take on romance on her latest 
single “Graveyard.” The song 
is yet another piece to her 2020 
project Manic, following the 
release of “Without Me” last 
October. “Without Me” was 
hailed a contemplative rarity for 
Halsey, with emotional turmoil 
and 
heartbreak 
gripping 
every word under its ambient, 
techno-pop haze. Her split from 
G-Eazy coats every lyric, down 
to its “Cry Me a River” homage. 
“Graveyard” 
radiates 
off 
this baggage. It trails over 
Halsey’s trials and tribulations 
in love, dusting a meditative 
film over her rumination of the 
past. Whereas “Without Me” 
highlights the betrayal of her 
ex-lover, 
“Graveyard” 
picks 
apart at the self, refusing to deny 
the enabling of past behaviors. 
Halsey 
recognizes 
that 
she 
“keeps digging [her]self down 

deeper” in obstinate pursuit of 
the destructive partner. 
This narrative blossoms under 
a spacey, bittersweet techno beat 
that builds synthy layer over 
synthy layer. It has to muster 
the courage of its confessional 

chorus with sharp keyboard 
instrumentals that crescendo 
into the track’s peppy, EDM core. 
A jarring gasp near the bridge 
cements the overall theme of loss 
and betrayal. 
The 
track 
functions 
as 
cohesively as any other Halsey 

track would. It might unfold in 
an era where Halsey strives to 
rebrand herself, but “Graveyard” 
does little to change the narrative 
she has carried throughout her 
entire career. Her lyrics run 
trite with derivative metaphors 
framed 
around 
the 
cliché 
“digging your own grave” 
narrative, leaving little to no 
insight on how it rings true in 
the case of her relationship. 
Lyrics like “eyes so dark, don’t 
know how you even see me” fall 
short of any thought provoking 
perspectives on failed love 
and leave little anticipation for 
the song’s progression. As far 
as standard EDM earworms 
go, “Graveyard” fits the bill for 
mainstream success. It certainly 
toys in areas less familiar 
to Halsey, but does little to 
diversify her musical pallette and 
potential.

‘10/10’

Rex Orange County

AWAL

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘10/10’

Last week, after hinting at a new 
song on social media, Rex Orange 
County released a new single and 
music video, “10/10.” Although he is 
dropping all the hints characteristic 
of an album rollout circuit, what 
has surfaced in his music, and in 
the “10/10” video in particular, is 
a longing to settle down.
The “10/10” video is at once 
wacky and heartwarming. It 
brings to life the cozy energy 
of Rex’s previous single, “New 
House,” setting the stage in a 
warm and welcoming household. 
The pals sit around the TV playing 
video games, the homie smokes 
in the corner, the gang chills 
around the couch gossiping and 
cuddling and reading and chilling 
out while Rex does his thing on 
the keyboard. After putting his 
headphones on, a goofy series of 
events follow. Rex wanders to the 
kitchen to make a sandwich before 

opting to steal somebody else’s. 
A group of performers wearing 
yellow Spider-Man costumes burst 
into a K-pop-style dance number. 
An electrician fumbling in the 
corner makes the house lights flash 

in a pretty sequence while Rex jams 
on the guitar. It’s funny and bizarre, 
and the way the video is cut — made 
to look like one shot — adds to the 
surreal absurdity.
“10/10” is Rex at a crossroads 
of nostalgia and looking forward 

to the future, returning to making 
warm memories with the people he 
loves. The ambient noise of friends 
relaxing in the house is tuned out 
when he puts on the headphones 
and begins performing, much 
like the way becoming a music 
sensation makes it hard not to 
tune out the life you had before. 
His opening verse captures the 
heart of the video, singing “I had 
to think about my oldest friends / 
Now, I no longer hang with them 
/ And I can’t wait to be home 
again.” When he finishes the 
song, he takes off the headphones 
and the comforting sound of the 
household returns. A sentiment 
of being uninspired has permeated 
Rex’s most recent songwriting, but 
that friendly chatter he misses is a 
welcome musical inspiration. It left 
me thinking about the old friends I 
need to call.

“Space is for everybody. It’s not just for a few people in science 
or math, or for a select group of astronauts. That’s our new 
frontier out there, and it’s everybody’s business to know about 
space.”
— Christa McAuliffe, Teacher and Challenger Astronaut
Jul. 20, 2019 marked the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 
moon landing, recalling not only the Cold War space race of an 
era gone by, but also generating nostalgia for one of humankind’s 
greatest achievements — our first steps on the moon. Yet, while 
the glory days of the Apollo missions are long gone, excitement 
for what many believe is a new golden age of exploration and 
discovery is happening right now. 
From new missions to return to the moon to possibly 
establishing human colonies on Mars, space exploration has 
returned in force, with big ambition. But it’s not only future 
astronauts who are leading the charge into this new age of 
discovery. Some of the most anticipated discoveries are being 
generated via observatories, whether space-based ones like the 
Hubble Telescope, or giant ground-based traditional ones. 
And while most of us won’t be on a rocket anytime soon, the 
stars are definitely within reach right here in Michigan.
Three ways to kick off your “star trek” here on campus range 
from the historic Detroit Observatory in the Bentley Historical 
Library, to the planetarium at the University of Michigan 
Museum of Natural History, to telescopes wielded by the students 
and residents of Ann Arbor at the Student Astronomical Society. 
Getting Starstruck
Excitement and passion for the sciences is tangible here on 
campus. More than a simple passion for education, or enthusiasm 
for the geekier side of all things space (live long and prosper), 
there has been a growing sense of animation among the 
community for the sciences. 
“Huge numbers of students are coming to the planetarium 
shows,” says Lori Ann Dick, manager of marketing and 
communications at the Museum of Natural History. “Weekend 
mornings are swarming. It’s a real community.” 
The 
museum, 
which 
has 
been 
undergoing 
extensive 
renovations this past year, has hit the ground running in its 
multi-staged re-openings. The Planetarium and Dome Theater 
exhibit and interactive experience has proven to be an exciting, 
highly anticipated part of the museum’s ongoing work to update 
their facilities and improve the overall visitor experience to the 
museum.
Adds Gary D. Krenz, who works with the Detroit Observatory: 
“I hear people excited about rejuvenating the pushing of 
boundaries. We are in a new phase of excitement, about 
exploring space. There’s been more public attention than I 
would have predicted.” And at the core of this excitement, Dr. 
Krenz observes, “Science has always been a combination of pure 
curiosity driven to push the bounds of knowledge.” Where better 

to find a kindred spirit to this curiosity than on a university 
campus? 
The reason for the excitement is threefold. First, both the 
museum and the observatory have a deep, rich history on campus. 
Planetarium manager Matt Linke explains, “The roots of the 
museum go back to the beginning of the University.” Linke jokes, 
“the original (museum) being a cabinet of curiosities almost 200 
years ago!” As for where these masses are coming from, Linke 
says “Generations have attended the museum — we already had 
the (audience) base, a kinship with those who came before.” 
While certainly the wonders of the museum draw visitors 
far and wide, it is undeniable that the museum also holds a 
special place in many Wolverine, and local Ann Arborite, hearts. 
Revisiting old memories and making new ones — all while 
engaging our child-like wonder and curiosity — is in us all. 
Dr. Krenz echoes this, emphasizing how the University has 
always held a track record for research and pushing the bounds 
of knowledge — a reputation that started with the foundation 
of the Detroit Observatory in 1854. While the observatory itself 
is no longer an “active” research observatory, it remains an 
“exciting hub for students.” 
Second, the emphasis on accessibility has been vital for 
drawing in both veteran science fans, and those eager to learn. 
The museum’s renovated planetarium features wheelchair 
friendly ramps and seating, along with chairs that have removable 
arms, allowing for those with limited mobility to rise and seat 
themselves with ease. 
But things don’t stop there — Linke highlights a new program 
for deaf children which was piloted at the planetarium, 
utilizing new technology to connect the exhibit’s accompanying 
soundtrack to the children’s auditory systems (such as implants). 
This enabled the visiting kids to experience the exhibit like any 
other child or adult might, providing a “normalized” experience 
for anyone and everyone. It’s an impressive level of inclusion for 
children with disabilities, showcasing both the museum and the 
University’s dedication to accessibility.
The observatory, too, has prioritized accessibility in the 
construction of the new annex — an additional entrance to the 
observatory, which will feature not only wheelchair entrances, 
but classrooms, event spaces 
and exhibits. 
From their headquarters 
in West Hall, the Student 
Astronomical 
Society 
tackles 
accessibility 
on 
the front lines of campus, 
working 
to 
inform, 
educate and showcase the 
wonders of astronomy to 
the 
campus 
community. 
As SAS outreach co-chair 
Josiah Sherk outlines, “SAS 
hopes to focus on outreach, 
improving our open houses, 
as 
well 
as 
focusing 
on 
external 
outreach 
within 
the community.” 
These open houses often 
include a variety of activities 
structured to engage and 
inform students from any 
discipline or major about 
astronomy. 
From 
physics 
demonstrations and models, 
to 
tutoring 
University 
students 
in 
astronomy, 
and 
even 
hosting 
open 
stargazing sessions utilizing 
the observing facilities at 
Angell Hall, SAS offers a 
variety of resources and 
tools to all its members, 
students and locals. 
Sherk further explains, 
“We are dedicated to taking 
people 
with 
a 
passing 
interest in astronomy, or 
dedicated to astronomy as a 
career path, (and) bringing 
them together and providing 
them 
with 
opportunities 
to 
give 
back 
to 
their 
community.”
Third, there is a key 
balance 
being 
struck 
between 
nostalgia 
for 
what’s old and a passion for 
embracing what’s new. 
As Matt Linke observes, 
“The 
Natural 
History 
Museum has been a presence 
on campus for the past 42 
years, and the museum has 
moved four times … We were 
in the Ruthven building for 
90 years –– a place that was 
near and dear to heart.” 
The team at the museum 
has welcomed the move to 
the new Biological Sciences 
Building 
with 
optimism 
and excitement. But while 
the modern design of the 
museum’s new home is awe-
inspiring, and renovations 
have 
brought 
more 
technologically 
advanced 
mechanics to the museum’s 

exhibits and organization, not everything in the newly reopened 
U-M museum is brand new. According to Dick, dozens of relics 
and exhibits from the old museum have been saved and brought 
to the new museum site.
“You’re walking around all this new stuff, and then you see 
something and go, ‘Oh, that’s familiar!’” Linke jokes. 
Back at the Detroit Observatory, a similar approach is 
underway. According to Dr. Kenz, new renovations don’t include 
any direct change or update to the original historic building. 
Rather, the construction hopes to add to the pre-existing space, 
in lieu of replacing it. 
The positive buzz around campus may be an indicator of a larger 
excitement brewing around the globe. Not everyone may share 
the cherished memories the Wolverines hold dear here in Ann 
Arbor, but this mix of nostalgia, accessibility and advancement 
can be seen on the national (and even international) level. 
Don’t Fix What Ain’t Broke
While the planetarium shows make for an excellent foray into 
the stars, SAS offers a more direct, hands-on way to continue 
your “star trek” through campus: telescopes. 
Both the observatory and SAS offer regular stargazing 
sessions and related activities throughout the year. But with the 
observatory currently under renovation, it’s the perfect time for 
SAS to shine. 
Aside from hosting most SAS events, Angell Hall also houses 
the Astronomy Department, along with its own observatory and 
viewing platform for students and faculty across campus.
New technology is undeniably helping to reinvent the field of 
astronomy, and the greater natural sciences, too. New smartphone 
apps — like SkyView, Star Chart and Star Rover to name a few 
— allow the everyday user to engage and interact with the stars 
on a new personal, more direct level. Many of these apps utilize 
augmented reality to enhance virtual stargazing. Users can use 
these apps to locate and view constellations, track objects in the 
sky and learn about our solar system. As cool as telescopes can be 
(they certainly recall a sense of vintage nostalgia), are apps the 
new everyman’s telescope? SAS’s Sherk says no. 
Sherk says, “Technology is developing as a tool, and it’s always 
been a tool — it just helps us do things more efficiently. The fact 
of the matter is that something the size of a smartphone will 
never be able to do what a telescope can do.”
While the capabilities of smartphones are seemingly 
immeasurable, it seems that no matter how advanced the 
classic iPhone or Samsung can get, their small size prevents the 
telescope from becoming obsolete. Sherk elaborates, “Larger 
telescopes will have a clearer image, and they’ll be able to see 
more. The reason we need to use a larger telescope is because it 
has a bunch of mirrors in it in order to capture as much light as 
possible to create a clearer image of what we’re trying to look at.” 
But, while telescopes continue to reign supreme, smartphones 
can still be a versatile tool for astronomical observation. Sherk 
explains, “Lots of people like to take amateur astronomy 
photography; They’ll try to take pictures through their 
telescopes, and some people even like to use their smartphones 
(for this) ... Using smartphones for photography, or even helping 
your telescope to locate certain objects in the sky, that (becomes) 
a great tool.”
For many, “science” often holds the connotation of new, 
cutting-edge and modern. Yet, when it comes to astronomy, 
it seems the old-fashioned methods can’t be beat. Sometimes, 
“new” doesn’t translate to “better.” As the saying goes, “Don’t 
fix what ain’t broke.”
For the amateur astronomers — or those eager to become 
one — both SAS’s open houses and telescope viewing sessions, 
along with buzz-worthy apps, are great ways to continue your 
exploration through the stars right here at “home.” 
To Infinity, and Beyond: A look to the future 
Campus has its head in the stars and so, it seems, does the rest 
of the world. Beyond the bounds of Ann Arbor, things are kicking 
into gear to usher into a new age of scientific discovery and space 
exploration. 
With advancing technology allowing for the realization of 
what were once impossible dreams, humanity’s gaze once again 
returns to the moon. To some, a moon landing may seem to be an 
old hat-trick — after all, it’s been done a few times already, hasn’t 
it? But while a dozen moon landings, 24 lunar orbits and roughly 
550 men and women launched into space may seem impressive, 
in actuality these numbers do not suggest an ease, or mastery of 
space travel. Rather, there is much more work to do. 
The new Apollo 11? A lunar base on the moon by 2030. A goal 
emphasized by growing interest from private sector companies 
to engineer commercial flights to space, from the likes of Virgin 
Galactic and SpaceX. On a smaller, more immediate scale, 2024 
has become the rallying point for humankind’s return to the 
moon — the “baby-steps” before the Star Wars-esque Lunar 
Base. Meanwhile, China and India have made space travel a new 
priority, suggesting that a modern-day space race is brewing –– a 
race potentially driven not only by politics, but by private-sector 
investment and innovation.
It is certainly an age of wonder that we have come upon. And 
for those who aren’t yet sold –– those who don’t feel the tell-tale 
itch of curiosity to get up, go out and learn about science! –– here 
are a few passing words to change your mind.
To anyone who has yet to take a jaunt to the museum, Linke 
offers, “Who doesn’t want to see a dinosaur?” (The museum 
has some very cool dinosaurs). Dick adds, “We’re open late on 
Thursdays, and it’s perfect for a date!” 
For the people who have deluded themselves into thinking 
telescopes aren’t the coolest thing about campus, Dr. Krenz 
enthuses, “There’s nothing quite like looking through a telescope. 
Seeing the rings of Saturn very clearly, for instance, or the moons 
of Jupiter — (The observatory) is still a place where people can 
(become) inspired; a place where people can touch the universe 
beyond the atmosphere.” 
So, consider taking a “star trek” here on campus. Experiencing 
the universe from behind an IMAX movie screen is all well and 
good — but the real thing, now that’s something worth seeing 
(and it’s free!). After all, it’s the final frontier.
