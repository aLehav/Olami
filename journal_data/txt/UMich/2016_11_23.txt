In November, The Michigan 

Daily administered a women’s 
health survey to 1,000 randomly 
selected respondents at the 
University of Michigan campus. 
There were 147 respondents, 
with 
115 
self-identifying 
as 

female.

The following article includes 

data collected in this survey, 
particularly 
with 
regard 
to 

beliefs about sex on campus.

From a young age, LSA senior 

Ariana 
Headrick 
considered 

premarital sex a healthy and 
important 
component 
of 
a 

relationship. 
In 
contrast, 

LSA junior Alexis Babbitt, a 

volunteer team leader for the 
Christian ministry organization 
Young Life, does not believe 
in premarital sex because of 
personal and religious reasons, 
and thinks it can be damaging 
for relationships.

According 
to 
a 
women’s 

health survey administered by 
The Michigan Daily to female 
students in November, both of 
these views are prevalent on 
campus, though the latter is 
much more common. 72 percent 
of respondents in the survey said 
they have parents who oppose 
premarital sex, and 28 percent 
said they oppose premarital sex.

Many respondents identified 

a variety of factors that influence 
opinion 
and 
belief 
about 

Since 2011, cases of opioid 

overdose deaths have dramatically 
increased in Washtenaw County, 
becoming an epidemic.

At a community-wide event “In 

Our Midst: The Opioid Epidemic, 
and a Community Response” 
Tuesday night at St. Joseph Mercy 
Hospital, experts discussed the 
crisis, and potential ways the 
community can engage to help 
find solutions. A similar event was 
held last week at the Ann Arbor 
District Library

The event was hosted by 

Dawn Farm, a 501c(3) nonprofit 
organization based in Ypsilanti, 
with an outpatient center in Ann 
Arbor, that works to assist addicts 
and alcoholics achieve long-term 
recovery from drugs and alcohol.

Nationwide, opioid addiction 

has taken an approximate 150 
lives a day, five to 10 people an 
hour, leading to a total of 48,000 
lives lost in 2015, according to 
Center for Disease Control. In 
Washtenaw County, there were 
49 reported deaths from opioid 
overdoses in 2015, and in 2016 
there have been 45 thus far.

Event 
coordinator 
Mark 

Albulov, a residential therapist at 
Dawn Farm, said in an interview 
that breaking down stereotypes 
around recovery and educating on 
its effects was the main goal of the 
evening.

“We 
want 
to 
disseminate 

the fact that people can and do 
recover, that there is an option … 

also to educate people that it is a 
medical disease,” Albulov said. 
“It’s not a moral failure, it’s not a 
criminal behavior, it’s a medical 
disease that has treatment.”

Stephen Strobbe, University 

of Michigan clinical associate 
professor, said the national crises 
of overdose deaths and the patterns 
of addiction-related incidences in 
Washtenaw County are strongly 
correlated. Strobbe is also the 
co-chair for the Washtenaw 
Health Initiative Opioid Project, 

a volunteer organization that 
unites law enforcement, public 
health, treatment facilities and 
other providers to secure opioid 
addiction treatment.

“This is a community initiative,” 

Strobbe said. “A handful of 
experts alone are not going to turn 
this around, it really does take a 
concentrated and concerted effort 
and those communities who have 
responded cohesively have had 
the best outcome.”

In explaining the magnitude of 

the issue, he cited CDC data that 
shows opioid overdose deaths 
have quadrupled from 1999 to 2014 
in the United States and exceeded 
the amount of motor vehicle 
deaths last year. He added that 
there were enough prescriptions 
written for every adult in the 
United States to receive a bottle of 
opioid pain medications.

He told the crowd that the WHI 

implements the Lazarus Model, 
an 
evidence-driven 
platform 

Throughout 
the 
2016 

presidential campaign, stricter 
immigration policies have been 
at the forefront of President-elect 
Donald Trump’s platform.

His 
policies 
have 
shifted 

in extremity over the passing 
months, from a call for a ban on all 
Muslim immigration to a broader 
ban to terror-prone nations such as 
Iraq and Syria. His list of priorities 
released after his election includes 
many of his initial proposals, such 
as deportations of undocumented 
immigrants, 
building 
a 
wall 

along the U.S.-Mexico border 
and cancelling executive actions 
signed 
by 
President 
Barack 

Obama.

Trump 
has 
deemed 
these 

orders, which include ones aimed 
at 
protecting 
undocumented 

children and adolescents and 
the families of U.S. citizens, as 
unconstitutional.

The main orders that Trump 

can immediately override once 
he steps into office are the 
Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals and Deferred Action

For 
seven 
years, 
Ypsilanti 

resident Yousuf was an interpreter 
for American troops deployed in 
Afghanistan. Wearing an American 
uniform and carrying a rifle, 
Yousuf was away from his home 

in the north Afghan city of Mazar-
i-Sharif for extended periods of 
time, traveling the country with 
American 
combat 
soldiers 
to 

translate and help train local forces 
and often being subjected to hostile 
ambushes on the road.

“The reason that I really wanted 

to work for U.S. troops and our 
government’s army to fight against 

the Taliban was because they were 
killing our people … they’d go to 
schools to fire on kids. They killed 
my cousins,” Yousuf, who asked to 
be identified by only first name due 
to safety concerns, said, adding that 
his long absences were difficult for 
his wife, Zahra. “If I get the chance, 
I would go and work for them 
again.”

After getting wounded in a 

firefight, and as the Taliban began 
targeting local interpreters for 
assassination, Zahra and Yousuf 
chose to accept an offer from his 
employer to resettle in the United 
States as refugees to protect their 
three sons.

The University of Michigan 

announced 
Tuesday 
it 
will 

participate in the 2017 deer 
management 
program, 
in 

partnership with the City of Ann 
Arbor.

The Ann Arbor City Council 

voted to implement a deer cull 
again this year, following the 
2016 program, which resulted 
in the death of 63 deer in parks 
and nature areas from January to 
February.

While the specific timing and 

locations of the deer culls are not 
yet determined, the University has 
indicated that Nichols Arboretum, 
areas 
between 
the 
railroad 

and Huron River, areas east of 
Fuller Road and south of Glazier 
Way, and areas west of Huron 
Parkway and south of Hubbard 
will be locations where lethal cull 
methods, including firearms, may 
be used. If any University property 
is used, it will be closed to the 
public from 4 p.m. until 7 a.m. on 
weekdays when the cull is taking 
place.

After a “Children of Yost” 

Twitter post on Monday morning 

suggested the idea, residents on 

the back side of Mary Markley hall 

used lights in their dorm rooms to 

spell out “Fuck OSU” Monday night, 

ahead of Saturday’s rivalry football 

game between the Wolverines and 

Buckeyes.

Children of Yost, the informal 

account associated with Michigan 

Hockey’s student section, issued the 

challenge to Markley residents by 

tweeting out a picture of of Markley 

in 1977 with the same message 

spelled out on the back side on the 

building.

“Yo, Markley residents. Find a 

way to pull this off again,” the tweet 

read.

The group’s call to action was 

answered that same day, with 

residents posting on social media 

about efforts to spell out the 

message.

Engineering senior Teddy 

Tran tweeted a picture at 5:40 

p.m. Monday of a group of students 

appearing to be organizing the feat 

for that evening.

“Lo an behold,” Tran said in 

the tweet. “A group of people are 

organizing this pretty well!”

Tran said in a tweet he does 

not take credit for organizing the 

message, but did help spread the 

word about what was happening.

“A group of other people put a lot 

of effort into organizing the whole 

thing,” the tweet read. “I just helped 

spread the word! Pretty incredible 

feat tbh.”

Monday night at around 8 p.m. 

— roughly 13 hours after Children 

of Yost first issued the challenge on 

twitter at 6:45 a.m. — pictures began 

surfacing of the buildings exterior 

with the message. The Children of 

Yost Twitter account congratulated 

the residents shortly after. 

In 1977, the year when Markley 

residents were first documented 

as sending the message ahead of 

the Ohio State game, legendary 

Michigan coach Bo Schembechler 

led Michigan to defeat Ohio State 

in Ann Arbor by a score of 14 to 6 to 

win the Big Ten. The team finished 

the season with a loss in the Rose 

Bowl to Washington and a record of 

10 wins and 2 losses.

The 10 win and 1 loss football 

team has similar aspirations this 

year, hoping to not only beat Ohio 

State and play in the Big Ten 

Championship Game on December 

3rd, but also potentially earn a trip to 

the College Football Playoff.

ON THE DAILY: RESIDENTS OF MARKLEY SEND OSU A MESSAGE

AMANDA ALLEN/Daily

Dr. Stephen Strobbe, University of Michigan clinical associate professor, talks about the 
contributing factors to the opioid epidemic as a part of the Dawn Farm Education Series 
at St. Joesph Mercy Hospital in Ypsilanti Tuesday.

ADDRESSING ADDICTION

In a statement Tuesday, the 

Department of Public Safety and 
Security wrote that DPSS was not 
aware until Saturday afternoon of 
an assault on a University lecturer 
last week, referred in testimony 
before Ann Arbor City Council 
Monday.

Khita Whyatt, lecturer of dance 

in the University of Michigan’s 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance, 
said in an interview after her 
testimony on the incident that she 
did not immediately call the police 
because she was so shocked, but 
her department chair contacted the 
DPSS. Two days after the incident, 
Whyatt said she was interviewed 
by two DPSS officers. During her 
testimony to Council, she called on 
the University to release a crime 
report about how she was knocked 

down and intimidated by unknown 
assailants. 
The 
event 
follows 

similar incidents where crime 
alerts had not been released. The 
University has released two crime 
alerts of hate crimes on campus 
over the past two weeks.

Whyatt wrote in an email sent 

Tuesday afternoon to recipients 
including 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel as well as The 
Michigan Daily that she waited 
until Saturday morning to report 
the assault to police because she 
was disoriented and did not know 
where to reach out.

“I did wait until Saturday 

morning to get in touch to report 
the incident,” Whyatt wrote. “I 
was in shock and still processing 
what to do prior to reaching out … 
it was also obvious that there was 
no way that these boys were going 
to be caught. Not being a student, I 
did not know who to report to. That 
must seem obvious by the fact that I 

emailed the head of my department, 
my dean and the president.”

In the statement, Diane Brown, 

spokeswoman for DPSS, said they 
were not aware of the situation 
until Saturday afternoon — two 
days after the alleged assault — 
but will be conducting a thorough 
investigation.

“When this allegation from 

Thursday morning came to our 
attention 
Saturday 
afternoon, 

we had officers follow up with 
the 
woman 
who 
experienced 

this,” Brown wrote. “We are very 
concerned about this incident 
and will conduct a thorough 
investigation.”

In her Tuesday afternoon email, 

Whyatt reiterated she felt DPSS 
should release a crime alert.

“Withholding information from 

the public is the same as lying, in my 
mind,” Whyatt wrote in the email. 
“Isolated events are happening all 
over the place and surely without 

a pattern. Not informing the 
campus is WRONG!”

Brown said no crime alert 

was issued due to the timeliness 
and the lack of a perceived 
public safety threat after DPSS 
learned of the incident.

“We chose not to issue a 

timely warning, or crime alert 
as we call them, Saturday night 
due to the amount of time that 
had transpired with no other 
similar reports,” Brown wrote. 
“When deciding whether to 
issue a timely warning, there are 
a number of factors we consider, 
including the perceived public 
safety threat, time of report and 
possible connected reports.”

Brown 
also 
encouraged 

victims of any similar incidents 
in the future to reach out to 
report incidents as soon as 
possible.

“We again are disturbed by 

this report we learned about 
Saturday 
afternoon,” 
Brown 

said. “We urge everyone to 
promptly report any incident of 
possible assault or intimidation 
to police so we can respond to the 
scene and search for suspects.”

premarital sex, including religion, 
individual values and culture. The 
data from the survey indicated 
that 56 percent of students feel 
their parents’ religion influences 
how they view health issues.

Respondents 
represented 
a 

wide range of religions, such 
as Christianity (50.41 percent), 
Judaism (5.69 percent), Hinduism 
(3.25 percent) and Islam (0.81 
percent). 

One student, who asked not 

to be named due to familial 
concerns, said her parents grew 
up in south India and have 
conservative 
Christian 
views 

about relationships and marriage.

“My parents don’t believe 

in premarital sex because of 
the Bible, because of religious 
reasons,” she said. “They don’t 
want guys to be a distraction 
when it comes to school.”

However, she noted that her 

parent’s opposition to premarital 
sex, she is sexually active, hiding 
her relationships and atheism 
from her parents.

“I don’t talk to my parents 

when it comes to that kind of stuff 
because they are conservative,” 
she said. “They don’t even want 
me to see a gynecologist.”

For many teens and young 

adults, sex education takes place 
primarily through conversations 
with peers. Views of premarital 
sex 
are 
context-dependent, 

influenced by the environment in 
which individuals are brought up 

and the friends with whom they 
surround 
themselves, 
making 

a campus enviornment host to 
many different views.

Headrick 
credits 
her 

willingness to talk about sex to 
the communities she’s involved 
in, including her role as peer 
facilitator at the University’s 
Program on Intergroup Relations 
— a social justice education 
program — and position as 
president of the Eugene V. Debs 
Cooperative House.

“I tend to surround myself with 

people who are open to talking 
about things,” Headrick said. “In 
general, it is very stigmatized, 
but you can find pockets where 
it’s celebrated and encouraged to 
communicate about sex.”

For there to be a reduction 

in the stigma she sees around 
sex, Headrick said, there needs 
to be an understanding of why 
premarital sex is important.

“First of all, if you are thinking 

about marrying someone, you 
should have sex before so you 
know that you are going to enjoy 
your lifetime of sex,” Headrick 
said. “I think it’s an important 
part of your life, and if you end 
up with someone you are not 
compatible with, that would be a 
bummer.”

However, Babbitt, who plans 

to pursue a career in full time 
ministry 
after 
graduation, 

said for those that practice 
the 
teachings 
of 
the 
Bible 

devoutly, 
premarital 
sex 
is 

wrong and should be saved for 
marriage. While Babbitt opposes 
premarital sex partly because of 
her religious beliefs, she also said 

she thought sex can be damaging 
to relationships and should be 
postponed.

“I have witnessed so many 

couples get caught up in sex and 
don’t end up resolving issues,” 
Babbitt said. “There is increased 
jealousy and problems. I think a 
lot of problems come up when a 
couple starts having sex.”

The survey results also found 

that many students are not 
engaged in open communication 
with their parents on a number 
of health topics, including sexual 
health — only 4.35 percent of 
those surveyed said they talk 
with their parents about sexual 
activity “very often,” while 36.52 
percent said they never talk 
with their parents about sexual 
activity.

Respondents attributed this 

lack of communication largely to 
the fact that they have different 
views than their parents and that 
they would rather talk to peers or 
medical professionals.

In contrast to the overall trend, 

Babbitt said she feels like she can 
talk openly to her parents about 
issues surrounding sex despite 
their differing viewpoints. While 
Babbitt said her parents do not 
oppose 
premarital 
sex, 
they 

support her decision to postpone 
having 
sex 
until 
marriage, 

support she said she feels lucky 
to have.

“I tell my parents everything,” 

Babbitt said. “If I told my parents 
I was having sex, they would be 
concerned because they know 
how dead set I am on this. They 
wouldn’t be upset that I actually 
had sex.”

Yousuf said.

In April 2015, the family arrived

in Ypsilanti by Jewish Family 
Services of Washtenaw County. 
While Yousuf was able to find 
full-time work at a local cleaning 
company and attend classes at 
Washtenaw Community College, 
a language barrier and the need 
to care for their children — the 
oldest is in first grade — made it 
difficult for Zahra to find her own 
employment.

But while Zahra struggled 

to find a job, another local 
community 
member 
was 

unwittingly creating one. One year 
before the family’s arrival to the 
United States, Ann Arbor resident 
Brea Albulov had begun sewing 
baby slings for her children after 
finding the commercial options 
unsatisfying. When acquaintances 
began asking if they could buy her 
slings, Albulov realized she could 
start a business and founded Hope 
Carried in February 2015.

As orders mounted in the fall 

of 2015, Albulov was not only in 
need of helping hands, but was 
also increasingly unsettled by 
the 
unfolding 
Syrian 
refugee 

crisis. While listening to an 
NPR interview of an Afghan 
humanitarian activist who was 
struggling to find work after fleeing 
to the United States as an asylee, 
Albulov saw an opportunity to 
empower displaced individuals.

“While giving money is always 

helpful 
because 
people 
need 

resources, providing a job can 
change a poverty cycle,” Albulov 
said. “There’s a whole subcategory 
of people who want to work but 
can’t.”

After contacting Jewish Family 

Services and Freedom House of 

Detroit — both of which resettle 
refugees in Southeast Michigan 
— Albulov began hiring refugee 
women as contractors to produce 
her baby slings, including Zahra.

Albulov 
handles 
orders 

through a website and packages 
and ships orders from her home, 
dropping off fabric and picking up 
completed slings once or twice a 
week from each woman’s home. 
She said this has allowed them to 
secure paid employment despite 
linguistic and cultural barriers, 
while also still being able to care 
for their young children at home.

Hope 
Carried 
currently 

employs five refugee seamstresses. 
Including Zahra, three are from 
Afghanistan, one is from Iraq and 
one is from Africa. Albulov said 
she intends to expand her hiring 
to all women who lack economic 
empowerment for varying reasons.

Speaking for Zahra, who is not 

fully proficient in English, Yousuf 
said Hope Carried has helped his 
wife adjust to their new life.

“It was hard for us, especially 

for my wife,” Yousuf said. “(Hope 
Carried) is really helping me and 
the whole family … as long as 
(Zahra) is busy, I’m happy.”

Other refugees employed at 

Hope Carried have similar stories.

Arriving 
in 
Michigan 
six 

months ago after fleeing Kabul 
in 2013 because her family was 
threatened for working in the local 
media, Zobaida said her job has 
allowed her to support her family 
in a way that wasn’t possible in 
Afghanistan. She requested to 
only be identified by her first name 
due to safety concerns.

“Before I didn’t have any jobs 

… my first job was to work with 
Brea,” Zobaida said. “It’s really 
hard for us. I have to work and 
help my husband to pay back our 
loans.”

The company has shipped 

more than 1,400 orders in the 
past year, with most customers 
coming through referrals. Albulov 

said she is preparing to launch 
a Kickstarter campaign to hire 
additional workers and purchase 
fabric in wholesale.

She noted that the current 

political 
climate 
surrounding 

backlash against refugee arrivals 
to the United States has added 
a sense of importance to her 
company’s mission, adding that 
she would continue hiring refugee 
women regardless of any potential 
backlash against her company. 
Rhetoric used in President-elect 
Donald Trump’s campaign has 
caused ongoing uncertainty and 
fear in the resettled refugee and 
advocacy community, especially 
over the past few weeks. For 
his first 100 days, Trump has 
prioritized 
extreme 
vetting 

for those from “terror-prone” 
countries. Which countries those 
would include has not been fully 
specified. 

“There was a period where 

I didn’t intentionally promote 
the 
fact 
that 
(my 
workers) 

were refugees,” Albulov said. 
“But with such backlash, it 
actually 
motivated 
me 
more 

to be really specific about who 
we’re intentionally empowering, 
because I think that when people 
talk so loud about not welcoming 
them, there needs to be a voice 
that’s shouting equally about 
welcoming them.”

Though they acknowledged 

the 
challenges 
they’ve 
faced 

in adjusting to their new home 
in 
Michigan, 
both 
refugee 

families expressed an upbeat and 
optimistic outlook toward their 
futures.

“I want to improve my English, 

and also I want my daughter to 
have a bright future,” Zahra said.

“It’s hard for us — we’ve got to 

work every single day to pay our 
bills … but these are money for 
me,” Yousuf said, pointing at his 
toddler-aged children, who were 
running around Albulov’s living 
room. “My kids.”

for Parents of Americans and 
Lawful 
Permanent 
Residents, 

which allow for undocumented 
immigrants who entered the 
United States as children and 
parents of U.S. citizens to remain 
in the country and seek lawful 
employment.

In 
a 
statement 
Monday, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel stated his support for 
the continuation of DACA to allow 
students to finish their studies 
at the University, saying he had 
joined dozens of other colleges and 
universities in co-signing a letter 
urging the federal government 
to continue the protections at the 
faculty Senate Assembly meeting 
Monday.

Silvia Pedraza, professor of 

sociology and American culture, 

said if Trump is able to accomplish 
all that he has outlined, it will 
have negative effects on many 
communities.

“If he makes good on all of them, 

the next four years will be terrible,” 
she said. “It will of course be 
particularly terrible for those who 
are refugees and undocumented, 
but it will also be terrible for all 
those who know them, who care 
for them, who would like to extend 
a hand of welcome to people who 
have contributed well to our 
society.”

Pedraza said Trump’s plans to 

undo these orders play into what 
she believes is the worst possible 
situation in regards to immigration 
policy.

“Another 
promise 
he 
will 

make good on is he will dismantle 
Obama’s executive orders with 
respect to DACA, so the young 
DREAM Act children, adolescents 
and young adults and DAPA,” she 

said. “That’s all in the worst-case 
scenario.”

Washtenaw Community College 

student Ivan Flores moved from 
Mexico to the United States with 
his parents when he was 6 years 
old under his father’s work visa, 
but his visa later expired after 
his parents separated. Flores said 
while living under DACA, he exists 
in an ambiguous situation where 
he is not fully legally or illegally in 
the country.

“There’s a very weird legal 

gray area,” he said. “We are not 
here lawfully but we are not here 
unlawfully, and there’s no path in 
the system to get out of that.”

The most prominent issue Flores 

faces currently, he said, is how 
fellow students do not understand 
the uncertainty surrounding his 
situation.

“Even for the people I know and 

talk to, it’s often hard for them to 
understand,” he said. “Sometimes 

there’s 
sympathy, 
sometimes 

there’s not, but people just don’t 
understand what it’s like.”

Social Work student Maria 

Ibarra-Frayre is also protected 
under DACA after the tourist visa 
she was granted when immigrating 
to the United States when she was 
9 expired. During her time on 
campus, she has worked to help 
other undocumented students find 
a place on campus of their own and 
to expand in-state tuition rights to 
nontraditional students, saying she 
wants them to have the same rights 
as resident students.

The University granted in-state 

tuition to undocumented students 
in 2013, but the ruling only applies 
to students who have graduated 
high school within the past 28 
months, which can rule out 
transfer and graduate students.

“I feel really passionate about 

college access for undocumented 
students,” Ibarra-Frayre said. “And 

creating space where they’re safe 
and they can have some kind of 
semblance of a normal life.”

Flores 
and 
Ibarra-Frayre 

both said they fear for their 
own 
statuses 
under 
Trump’s 

administration. 
Ibarra-Frayre 

noted that everyone with DACA 
or DAPA status are registered with 
the U.S. government, providing 
information to allow for their 
deportation.

“I don’t think they really 

understand the gravity of what 
DACA does,” she said. “I don’t 
think they know that immigration 
has everything they need to know 
about me … even though, yes, it 
is really hard to deport 11 million 
people, they have the information 
of thousands of DACA students.”

Overall, however, Ibarra-Frayre 

said she was most concerned 
about the real human lives behind 
the numbers — the families and 
students whose futures will be 

directly impacted by the repeal of 
DACA and DAPA.

“I thought that I could have a 

normal life with DACA, but now 
it might be gone,” she said. “I’m 
more angry than afraid … I’m 
more worried about students in 
high school who want to go to 
college who imagine a future for 
themselves that is not going to 
happen.”

Similarly, 
Flores 
said 
he’s 

worried the country’s election of 
Trump will have ramifications for 
more than immigration — and that 
given the sway Trump’s rhetoric 
has had on millions, he finds the 
future of the nation more troubling 
than his situation.

“I’m scared for the country and 

not necessarily myself,” he said. 
“I don’t think we’ve ever had a 
demagogue like Donald Trump get 
elected. The thing that scares me 
the most is how easily people are 
taken in by his lies.”

are 

also being considered on North 
Campus during Spring Break (Feb. 
25 to March 5) when campus is less 
populated.

Several Ann Arbor residents 

have 
expressed 
dissatisfaction 

with the city’s decision, protesting 
at City Council meetings and 
brandishing signs as they spoke 
out about their opposition to the 
city’s program to kill a part of the 
growing local deer population. 
However, biologists have noted 
that a deer cull would be beneficial 
for ecological sustainability, and 
officials commend the University’s 
actions and cooperation, as it would 
have been difficult otherwise to 

effectively carry out the cull.

The University is contributing 

to an estimated 15 percent of the 
total cost, less than $25,000, in 
accordance with the percentage 
of 
University-owned 
property 

within the Wards 1 and 2. Dates, 
times and locations have not yet 
been finalized, but once they are, 
DPSS will make sure that the 
community is notified and the 
appropriate signs are posted.

started by Project Lazarus, a public 
health nonprofit in Wilkes County, 
N.C. The model posits that opioid 
overdose deaths are preventable 
and communities are ultimately 
responsible for managing their 
own health, aiming to combine 
ideas of public awareness, coalition 
action, data and evaluation, as well 
as community education, addiction 
treatment and provider education.

Strobbe said to reduce the 

stigmas associated with substance 
abuse, there needs to be an 
understanding 
and 
acceptance 

by community members that it 
is should be seen as a medical 
disorder that respond to treatment.

Ashton 
Marr, 
president 
of 

Washtenaw Recovery Advocacy 
Project 
and 
another 
speaker, 

described her personal experience 
of being in long-term recovery from 
opiod use.

“I’ve heard time and time 

again that it’s easier to write the 
prescription, as opposed to getting 
into conflict with somebody or 
fighting about it,” Marr said. “But 
the fact of the matter is they have 
the hand in the individual’s death 
if they let the addiction spiral. 
Doctors are in a position where they 
need to do no harm and give care to 
people, so it’s important that they 
understand how to treat addiction, 
recovery-related resources, how to 
safely prescribe to people, and how 
to treat pain.”

Marr 
also 
emphasized 
the 

importance of bystander care, 
including calling 911 and providing 
resources for help, like the sheriff’s 
office for community outreach 
where she works.

Clinical Assistant Prof. Gina 

Dahlem, a nurse practitioner at the 

University, also highlighted ways 
police officers and first responders 
are combating opioid overdoses 
locally, through administration of 
the drug naloxone.

She 
demonstrated 
how 
a 

bystander who isn’t a trained 
professional 
could 
administer 

naloxone, and said it was a crucial 
part of combatting the opioid 
epidemic.

“Naloxone reversals are critical, 

these are saving lives,” Dahlem 
said. “The next important step is 
for individuals who benefit from 
these reversals to have links with 
community peers for peer support, 
to help treatment and lifelong 
recovery.”

I

’ll be honest: I think 
these 
next 
few 
years 

will probably be tough 

for people of marginalized 
identities. 
Many 
people 
in 

these groups, myself included, 
can only describe 
our 
expectations 

with 
one 
word: 

fear. Fear of the 
unknown, fear for 
our political system 
and, most of all, fear 
for my future as a 
young Black male in 
a country that more 
closely 
resembles 

the racist America I 
thought only existed 
in old photographs.

Luckily, I’m not alone in my 

despair. Roughly half of the 
nation awoke on the morning 
of Nov. 9 with a similar sense 
of trepidation. Here at the 
University of Michigan, my 
fears were shared by about 90 
percent of the student body, and 
Trump’s unexpected victory 
was met by demonstrations 
across campus.

“Ninety percent of (UM 

students) rejected the kind 
of hate … that was expressed 
during 
the 
campaign,” 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel said at one of the most 
publicized 
demonstrations, 

which occurred the day after 
the election at a vigil on the 
Diag. He closed his address by 
reminding students that “this 
is the way America changes … 
for the better.”

His statement proved to be 

tendentious, as conservative 
students 
came 
out 
of 
the 

woodwork to challenge his gall. 
Their opposition to Schlissel’s 
comments culminated in the 
creation of the #NotMyCampus 
campaign 
— 
an 
effort 
to 

condemn the ostensibly liberal 
attitudes of top University 
administrators.

When I broke this news to my 

parents back home, they were in 
disbelief. “How could anybody 
be offended by what he said?” 
they asked. And sadly, I didn’t 
have a response for them. After 
over a week of contemplating, 
however, I’ve finally found an 

answer: The offended students 
simply 
misunderstand 
the 

fundamental purpose of these 
anti-Trump protests.

After sifting through many 

of the complaints lodged by 

conservatives, 
it’s 
apparent 
that 

they can be split 
into 
two 
groups: 

people 
offended 

that the University 
is 
espousing 

supposedly 
“anti-

Republican” 
ideas 

and people who don’t 
think that a public 
university 
should 

have 
any 
political 

opinions at all. 

The first group, disgruntled 

Republicans, is making the 
fatal mistake of categorizing 
anti-hate messages as anti-
Republican. During a typical 
election cycle, I would agree 
that 
President 
Schlissel’s 

comments were unnecessary. 

But, as all of our elders can 
attest, this was not a normal 
election. 
Donald 
Trump 

spent the past few months 
hurling objectively racist and 
sexist insults to anyone who 
opposed 
him. 
Denouncing 

that this rhetoric is not “anti-
Republican,” but instead is 
“pro-human 
decency.” 
If 

the 
Democratic 
candidate 

adopted Trump’s language on 
the campaign trail and then 
went on to win the national 
election, these protests would 
still be occurring. Calling out 

bigotry is not a partisan issue; 
it’s simply an issue of civility 
and moral integrity. Instead of 
viewing these protests as anti-
Republican, as many campus 
conservatives are doing, the 
correct way to judge them is 
as 
demonstrations 
against 

hateful and vile language (that 
just happened to be espoused 
by a Republican). In essence, 
these protests, and Schlissel’s 
remarks, are against Donald 
Trump’s divisive platform, not 
the party he represents.

The second group, people 

who believe the University 
administrator is in the wrong 
simply for making any political 
statements, is mistaken for 
similar reasons. Had Schlissel 
come out to condemn Trump’s 
tax policies or his views on the 
Second Amendment, I would 
also argue that his statements 
were unnecessary. However, 
Schlissel and protesters are 
not reacting to the factional 
minutiae of Trump’s policy 
proposals. 
Their 
responses 

are a direct response to the 
president-elect’s 
hateful 

bombasts 
that 
target 

members of the University 
community. As a campus full 
of undocumented immigrants, 
students of color, members of 
the LGBTQ community and 
other marginalized identities, 
it’s the University president’s 
job to ensure that we’re all 
welcome. 
Had 
President 

Schlissel 
not 
confronted 

Trump’s schismatic rhetoric, it 
would have been a dereliction 
of duty.

As much as we’d like to 

believe it, racism is not dead. 
If anything, this election has 
shown that over the past few 
decades, little has changed. 
Furthermore, progress won’t 
be 
made 
until 
Americans 

lambaste 
Trump’s 
hateful 

language. However, this will 
never 
occur 
until 
people 

realize that rejecting hate 
isn’t a partisan issue, but 
rather, it’s a matter of doing 
the right thing.

I

t should not come as a 
surprise to anyone that, 
in the wake of the 2016 

presidential election, Bernie 
Sanders is poised to become 
the kingmaker of the 
Democratic 
Party. 

Like a white-haired, 
elderly 
version 
of 

Marlon 
Brando 

with 
a 
Brooklyn 

accent, the Vermont 
senator’s influence is 
unmatched on Capitol 
Hill. The gatekeeper 
of progressivism, the 
populist 
champion 

of 
white 
working-

class voters in the 
primary, the key to millions of 
millennial voters ... For someone 
who started his presidential bid 
as a marginalized candidate, 
laughed at and cast aside, suffice 
it to say that Bernie Sanders is 
doing pretty well for himself.

For examples of Sanders’ 

Godfather-like stature, look no 
further than recent comments 
from Senate Minority Leader-
elect Chuck Schumer. The 
Huffington 
Post 
reported 

that Schumer is “all-in” on 
Sanders’ vision for the party, 
and Sanders reiterated his 
belief that Schumer “will do a 
great job.” Yes, this is the same 
Schumer that voted for the Iraq 
War, for the Patriot Act and for 
the repeal of Glass-Steagall Act 
who’s being endorsed by the 
most liberal voice in the Senate. 
But Bernie said it was OK, so 
critics on the left have stayed 
relatively 
quiet. 
That’s 
the 

power we’re talking about here.

Perhaps the more notable 

of 
Bernie’s 
hand-picked 

Democrats to help in the 
rebuilding of the party is Keith 
Ellison, who has served as a 
representative of Minnesota 
for about a decade. Ellison 
is 
originally 
from 
Detroit, 

graduated from Wayne State 
University and is the first 
Muslim elected to serve in 
Congress. He was one of 
the first elected officials to 
endorse Sanders over Clinton 
in the primary, and part of the 
reason he has garnished his 
reputation as a progressive 

is because of his association 
with the runner-up for the 
Democratic 
presidential 

nomination. 
Now, 
he 
is 

the 
overwhelming 
favorite 

to 
become 
the 

chairman 
of 

the 
Democratic 

National 
Committee, 
a 

position 
Donna 

Brazile 
resigned 

from in October. 

Make 
no 

mistake, 
this 

will be one of the 
most 
difficult 

jobs to undertake 
for the next four 

years. The next chairperson 
is responsible not only for 
organizing a party in disarray 
after an embarrassing loss 
but will also often be the 
figurehead of opposition to a 
Donald Trump administration. 
They 
will 
have 
unrivaled 

influence 
when 
it 
comes 

to 
funding 
and 
organizing 

congressional races in 2018 
(a year in which the Senate 
map does not look friendly for 
Democrats) and the selection of 
a presidential candidate in 2020.

This is why I would caution 

Democrats who are all too 
ready to jump on the Keith 
Ellison 
bandwagon. 
Bernie 

Sanders’ blessing is a coup 
for anyone looking to succeed 
with progressive voters today. 
He’s a great option. But take 
into account the fact that this 
job will be as much about tone 
as it is about content.

Some 
Democrats 
have 

responded to Ellison’s status 
as 
heir-apparent 
with 
an 

interesting, 
if 
unlikely, 

proposition: Joe Biden. They 
salivate over the idea of “Uncle 
Joe” taking the reins as a kind 
of post-vice presidency project, 
adding that this undertaking 
requires someone’s undivided 
attention and that Ellison will 
be busy fulfilling his duty as a 
congressman. Why? Because 
it’s Joe Biden’s tone that the 
Democratic Party needs right 
now. 

The Clinton campaign was 

at a disadvantage from the 

very beginning when it came 
to tone. Donald Trump and 
Bernie Sanders could be angry, 
they could yell and scream 
and wave their arms around 
in 
frustration. 
Meanwhile, 

double 
standards 
stripped 

Clinton of these tools; as a 
woman, whenever her voice 
went above a normal speaking 
volume or became the slightest 
bit aggressive, she was accused 
of being shrill and harpy-like. 
It seems as though the DNC is 
poised to put itself at the same 
disadvantage.

Keith Ellison is calm and 

collected. He looks and sounds 
like a professor in many ways. 
He 
doesn’t 
get 
animated, 

he doesn’t get loud. I’m not 
saying that’s a bad thing — I’m 
just saying that it’s not what 
Democrats need right now. 
Right now they need Uncle 
Joe. They need someone who 
can bridge the gap between 
the Obama coalition and the 
white working-class voter that 
abandoned 
Hillary 
Clinton. 

They need someone who can 
be stern yet statesmanlike, 
express anger and frustration, 
but do it in a productive 
way. Go re-watch his speech 
from this year’s Democratic 
National Convention — that’s 
what they need.

The work that Bernie Sanders 

is doing right now is important. 
He’s building an A-team of 
progressive 
lawmakers 
to 

act as a counterweight to 
the 
Trump 
administration, 

to lead a broken party in a 
new direction and to set up 
politicians 
like 
Elizabeth 

Warren for a potential run 
in 2020. But when it comes 
to the chairmanship of the 
DNC, there’s a discussion still 
to be had. The election is in 
February, and I’m not so sure 
that Keith Ellison is the right 
man for the job. A fired-up Joe 
Biden, ready to scream right 
back in Donald Trump’s face, 
though? Well that’s another 
story entirely.

Pressing pause on the new DNC

New conversations on Thanksgiving

ANTHONY COZART | OP-ED

T

hanksgiving might be 
a little different this 
year. 
Yes, 
there 
will 

still be turkey, madness on 
Black Friday and Ohio State 
versus Michigan on Saturday. 
However, many of us are facing 
difficult 
and 
uncomfortable 

political discussions with family. 
Even if the subject is avoided on 
Thursday, our feelings will still be 
present and conflict more likely. 
Several of my friends have since 
changed their travel plans, and, 
as we saw in a recent New York 
Times article, they’re not alone.

How 
can 
we 
make 

Thanksgiving this year just a 
little bit better? Perhaps to break 
the ice, or instead of avoiding 
politics 
entirely, 
consider 

discussing the value behind 
Thanksgiving: gratitude.

Many of us already, sort of, do 

this. In my family, we each say 
one or two things we’re thankful 
for before eating. For me, this 
has often meant acknowledging 
positive 
experiences 
or 
the 

chance to see my brother 
who lives across the country. 
Being mindful and thankful 
in this way isn’t bad. Yet being 
thankful for things or successes, 
as opposed to acknowledging 
our gifts and responsibilities, 
leaves the most important ideas 
about our privilege unsaid.

By doing so, we fail to see 

our own privileges accurately 
and 
to 
acknowledge 
our 

responsibilities. All of us at 
the University of Michigan 
have reasons to be thankful, 
even if in the weeks following 
the election it may not feel 
this way. We’re all gifted, be it 
with numbers, words, sound 
or 
athletics. 
Though 
hard 

work may have contributed to 
our successes, the support of 

those around us has allowed 
us to develop our gifts (which 
we don’t morally deserve) into 
talents and abilities. Honesty 
is acknowledging the role of 
our gifts and of others, not 
our work ethic, in our success. 
With these privileges comes a 
responsibility — the etymology 
of the word is response to one’s 
actions and abilities — to others.

David Brooks’ most recent 

book, “The Road to Character,” 
put 
this 
practice 
— 
of 

acknowledging success but not 
our gifts and responsibilities 
— 
into 
broader 
context. 

Our 
culture 
has 
shifted 

dramatically since the 1940s, 
from one in which individuals 
practiced 
self-effacement 

and restraint to one of self-
promotion 
and 
expression. 

We’re told from a young age and 
at each graduation ceremony in 
our lives that we alone can do 
anything. We’re encouraged 
to focus on ourselves and not 
others. In our meritocratic 
society, 
borrowing 
Brooks’ 

words, the “Big Me” dominates.

The election demonstrated 

the prevalence of this outlook. 
Voters 
from 
both 
parties 

expressed anxieties about their 
jobs and concerns for their own 
families and religious values. 
This isn’t a bad thing; issue 
voting helps to set the political 
agenda and the priorities of 
government agencies. But so 
much of politics has become 
about me: my problems, my 
anxieties 
and 
my 
country. 

Trump arguably is the Biggest 
Me: 
He 
repeatedly 
touts 

his fame, business and $3.3 
billion name. With Brooks’s 
thesis in mind, Trump’s wide 
support becomes a bit easier to 
understand.

We’ve given less thought to 

our neighbors, communities and 
the needs of others, in both our 
personal and political lives. We 
craft our own success stories — 
personally, for example, how I got 
into graduate school here — yet 
we give little attention to our gifts, 
graces and responsibilities. Few, 
including me, acknowledge that 
success often comes at the expense 
of our peers. Our culture’s shift 
toward the Big Me makes having 
conversations about politics, which 
many of us feel are so desperately 
needed, even more difficult.

It doesn’t have to be this way, 

as Brooks writes. We can start 
to change this Thanksgiving. 
Instead 
of 
fighting 
over 

candidates, 
ask 
your 
family 

about the sacrifices they’ve made 
for one another. Listen to their 
thoughts on privilege. Discuss 
what responsibilities we have to 
others. Craft your stories from 
the 
semester 
differently, 
by 

acknowledging your gifts and 
privileges as opposed to your 
successes and hard work.

Consider another example: 

Thirty-three 
years 
ago 
this 

weekend, 
Bo 
Schembechler 

told his players to recognize the 
effects of their actions on the 
team in everything that they 
did on campus. Each player had 
a responsibility derived from 
his gifts and support from the 
University to his line mates, 
coaches and the team. Let’s think 
differently and more deeply 
about gratitude to get through 
this week. We might even have 
another thing to be thankful for 
on Saturday afternoon.

“Didn’t you die on ‘Orange is the New Black?’ “

The characters on “You’re the 

Worst” are best described as, 
well, the worst. 
These disaffected 
Angelenos are by 
turns narcissistic 
and 
callous, 

disinterested 
and 
egotistical, 

bitterly 
cruel 

and 
relentlessly, 

hopelessly broken. 
In the stellar part 
one of the season 
three finale, “You 
Knew It Was A 
Snake,” Gretchen (Aya Cash, 
“Easy”) says as much to Jimmy 
(Chris Geere, “Urge”): that the 
two of them are fundamentally 
splintered and subdued souls, and 
there’s not enough space in this 
wheel-spinning relationship for 
that much chaos.

The exchange could serve as 

a sort of thesis statement for the 
series as a whole. “You’re the 
Worst” is interested not so much 
in human relationships as it is in 
the futility of trying to be in one 
at all.

How much will we endure, 

really, to be with the ones we 
love? The underlying toxicity of 
the three principal relationships 
has never been more explicitly 
rendered than in “You Knew 
It Was A Snake.” The episode 
functions like a twisted Edward 
Albee 
play, 
tracking 
the 

downward spirals of Lindsay 
(Kether Donhue, “Pitch Perfect”) 
and Paul (Allan McLeod, “Life 
After Beth”), Edgar (Desmin 

Borges, “Preacher”) and Dorothy 
(Collette Wolfe, “Interstellar”) 
and Jimmy and Gretchen in 
cross-cutting scenes of flared 
tempers and aggressive hostility. 
It’s riveting — and excruciating — 

to watch.

Dorothy’s 

jealousy 
and 

resentment 
over 
Edgar’s 

instantaneous 
success 
is 
a 

somewhat 
odd 

pivot, 
especially 

given the weight 
of 
his 
storyline 

earlier 
in 
the 

season. 
But 

Lindsay 
and 

Paul’s standoff is a marvel of 
dark comedy. Their storyline 
this season ranged from comic 
absurdity — it’s easy to forget that 
Lindsay both microwaved a used 
condom to inseminate herself and 
literally stabbed her husband in 
the back — to the most nuanced of 
scenes, as the show’s treatment of 
her abortion was one of its more 
successful moments.

But if theirs was the most 

outright 
hilarious, 
then 
our 

principal couple’s devolvement 
was 
the 
most 
devastating. 

Gretchen and Jimmy haven’t 
traversed 
the 
traditional 

television rom-com route: they 
got together, and then stayed 
together. And in that subversion, 
the show has become more brutal 
and unsparing in its depiction of 
their relationship.

“You’re The Worst” is not an 

easy watch. It’s a comedy, and a 
romantic one at that, but it also 
rejects the idealization of love 
and monogamy that we so often 

succumb to. Creator Stephen 
Falk (“Orange Is the New Black”) 
takes no prisoners: Gretchen and 
Jimmy need each other, and it’s 
impossible to imagine them apart, 
but it’s also inconceivable that 
watching their relationship won’t 
be akin surveying a car crash on 
the side of the road.

Take, for example, the closing 

shot of the finale. It’s an explicit 
callback to the final shot of the 
penultimate episode: a split screen 
of Jimmy’s and Gretchen’s faces 
as they both drive in separate 
cars, right next to each other, but 
still separated by a barrier they 
can’t breach.

The finale ends on a strikingly 

similar note. Jimmy, having 
just 
proposed 
to 
Gretchen, 

is completely shaken by her 
casual use of the word “family.” 
In perhaps the show’s coldest 
moment, he immediately leaves 
her, newly engaged, and drives 
away. The left side of the shot is 
Jimmy’s panicked face; the right 
side is Gretchen’s signature pout, 
fireworks incongruently bursting 
behind her. I’d call it cliché if I 
weren’t so emotionally shaken.

The show is full of dramatic 

ironies like these, but at what 
point do we stop praising the 
show for its subversiveness and 
simply commend it for being its 
own entity? “You’re The Worst” 
is constantly defined by its 
relationship to other rom-coms, 
but it’s defiantly singular in its 
willingness to stand, unflinching, 
and stare down the barrel of the 
emotional difficulty of human 
connection. 
Intimacy 
and 

warmth and genuine meaning — 
these take grueling work. But the 
alternative? That’s the worst.

‘You’re the Worst’ finale explores 
the difficulty of human interaction

Season Three of FXX show unflinchingly tackled deep emotional issues

TV REVIEW

I 

was taught growing up that 
if someone was bullying 
me or hurled a hurtful 

comment toward me, I should 
ignore it and not let the malice 
get to me. I did 
my best to follow 
that 
mantra, 

but I sometimes 
retaliated against 
those who would 
provoke me.

In 
retrospect, 

it 
makes 
sense 

that 
I 
didn’t 

always 
react 

in 
the 
mature, 

level-headed way 
that 
I 
should 

have when it came to those 
kinds of harmful situations. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
seems 
like 

that pattern of retaliation still 
exists today, but in a virtual 
form that intensifies its impact. 
With the anonymity of the 
Internet, social media users 
can say whatever they please 
almost without consequence. 
Simultaneously, 
the 
online 

deindividuation makes people 
much more susceptible to being 
offended by and easily drawn 
to 
provocative 
comments, 

particularly on Twitter.

This kind of instance in 

particular is relevant to the 
most recent Twitter controversy 
with Donald J. Trump, 
(a 

well-known 
cyberbully) 
and 

our 
President-elect. 
Last 

week, Trump caught flack for 
bashing the cast of Broadway’s 
acclaimed 
hit 
musical 

“Hamilton” 
for 
allegedly 

“harassing” his running mate, 
Indiana 
Gov. 
Mike 
Pence, 

who attended a showing of 
the musical. In reality, the 
“Hamilton” cast did not harass 
Pence, but one of its stars, 
Brandon Victor Dixon, offered 
a rather powerful, sensitive and 
respectful message to Mr. Pence 
about protecting the rights 
of American minorities and 
people from all races, creeds 
and orientations.

Still, that didn’t stop Twitter 

users from firing back against 
Trump, as hundreds flocked 
to respond to his message with 
snarky, vehement comebacks. 
Admittedly, Trump deserved 
the hate he got for brewing such 
a malevolent tweet against a 
cast of Broadway actors who 
gave the American people a 
statement 
about 
embracing 

diversity and love. It’s also 
ridiculous how the man who 
will be running the country for 
the next four years continues to 
fall back on hiding behind the 
hollow, vindictive shell of his 
Twitter account.

However, 
the 
fact 
that 

Trump’s controversy against 
“Hamilton” received way more 

attention 
from 
mainstream 

and social media is absurd, 
especially considering that the 
much bigger story of Trump’s 
$25 million fraud settlement 

for his fake Trump 
University 
was 

downplayed 
tremendously. Even 
such 
a 
notable 

publication like the 
New 
York 
Times 

made the “Hamilton” 
story 
bigger 
than 

the 
$25 
million 

settlement 
story 

on 
their 
Saturday 

online front page.

Most of Trump’s 

online strategy — and I’m 
assuming this may be the 
strategy of many other Internet 
trolls as well — is intended to 
provoke people who he knows 
will get offended by his tweets. 
This 
strategy 
only 
works 

depending on how willing we 
are to retaliate and to let his 
malice get the better of us.

Though many Twitter users 

were 
affected 
by 
Trump’s 

“Hamilton” tweet, some were 
undeterred. 
“Silicon 
Valley” 

star, comedian and avid Twitter 
user Kumail Nanjiani retweeted 
an 
article 
from 
Politico, 

regarding how the American 
people are so easily vulnerable 
to Trump’s deceptive, taunting 
Twitter clickbait. In an even 
more direct response, Little 
Miss Flint posted a tweet, 
reminding people that there 
are way bigger issues than the 
“Hamilton” debacle, like, I don’t 
know, the Flint water crisis.

A similar situation occurred 

earlier this week when Trump 
denounced 
NBC’s 
“Saturday 

Night Live” on Twitter for 
being “one-sided” and “biased,” 
implying 
that 
there 
should 

be “equal time.” Actor Alec 
Baldwin, who has impersonated 
Trump since the 42nd season 
premiere of the late-night sketch 
show, responded with a series 
of brutal tweets that put the 
President-elect in place about 
focusing on the responsibilities 
of his impending job and not 
on trivial pursuits like Twitter 
bashing.

And while it was sweet to see 

Baldwin take down Trump, the 
irony was that it still didn’t solve 
the real issue at hand, which 
is that Trump’s tweets should 
not be the forefront of national 
issues in the media. To tell the 
President-elect that what he’s 
saying is stupid or wrong is just 
giving him more incentive to 
continue making provocative 
statements. Pushing back and 
retaliating 
against 
hateful 

online comments is juice for 
Trump and online bullies alike.

It’s not entirely unjustified, 

though: 
Baldwin 
had 
the 

total right to call out Trump 
for continuing to give every 
single pissed off Twitter user 
an aneurysm, especially since 
he is literally about to become 
president of the United States. 
However, regardless of how 
articulate and witty your tweet 
comeback against Trump may 
be to you and your followers, 
Trump will proceed to make a 
plethora of politically incorrect 
tweets unless his presidency 
somehow 
reforms 
him 
to 

become a more conscientious 
human 
being, 
if 
that 
ever 

happens.

Twitter often acts as a liberal 

echo chamber, and users like 
Donald 
Trump 
rattle 
that 

chamber and consequently grin 
about the worthlessness of our 
complaints. Whenever people 
are filled with strong emotions 
about something, they often 
go to Twitter to share their 
unfiltered thoughts, whether 
to vent about Trump or say 
something clever about life, 
pop culture nostalgia or the 
brokenness of society.

I’ll admit that I’ve definitely 

been 
guilty 
of 
retaliating 

online to stuff Trump has 
said, especially when he wrote 
his infamous “Appreciate the 
congrats” tweet after the tragic 
shootings at a gay nightclub 
in Orlando last June. This 
was 
when 
then-Democratic 

presidential canidate Hillary 
Clinton retaliated with the 
phrase, “Delete your account,” 
a comment that, while fantastic 
in execution, didn’t end up 
swaying 
Trump’s 
Twitter 

followers to unfollow him.

What, then, are we supposed 

to do as the 21st century 
members of a flawed democracy 
verging on a fascist regime? Do 
our tweets, Facebook statuses 
and YouTube videos possess 
any positive influence against 
the pushback of the alt-righters 
and trolls of the Internet? 
How can our passionate online 
venting create any change if our 
audience is predominantly like-
minded?

I’m not sure. I fear that 

social media has become too 
toxic at this point for anyone 
to take down radical online 
contrarians. Though Trump’s 
tweets may continue to be 
laced with veiled and direct 
misogyny, racism, sexism and 
blatant stupidity, the best way 
to react to a taunting cyberbully 
like Trump is to ignore him and 
show him that his words cannot 
get to us.

ROSENBERG

ALBUM REVIEW

I’ve never felt more conflicted 

than I did when 
Gerard 
Way 

first 
announced 

Hesitant 
Alien 

in May of 2014. I 
was dying for the 
chance 
to 
hear 

him 
sing 
again 

and 
immensely 

proud that he was 
exploring 
music 

in ways he wasn’t 
able to before, but 
at the same time, 
the fact that he was releasing 
solo music made it clear that 
My Chemical Romance would 
never create together again. The 
same feeling overcame me upon 
my first listen to former MCR 
guitarist Ray Toro’s debut album.

Remember 
the 
Laughter 

comes three-and-a-half years 
after MCR’s split, with little 
fanfare; Toro has hidden almost 
completely out of the public 
sphere for the entire period. 
The 
work 
lies 
somewhere 

on the softer, sweeter end 
of 
the 
musical 
spectrum, 

and is especially impressive 
considering that Toro sings and 
plays instruments for almost 
everything on the album.

“Requiem” 
starts 
out 

tenderly, with steady plucked 
notes that hover as the piece 
unfolds, gradually transforming 
into a nostalgic look back at 
good things passed. Toro’s voice 

is especially soft 
in the beginning, 
when 
he 
sings 

“You 
can 
run 

away / From all 
the things that 
hurt you in the 
past / And you 
can hide away / 
Or face the truth 
and live your life 
at last”

The album is 

extremely diverse 

from song to song. “We Save” 
is heavily inspired by the blues, 
with prominent, strutting bass, 
short yet expressive lyrical lines 
and dexterous guitar. As he 
sings “Gunshot, black like a stain 
/ It don’t wash out these veins,” 
Toro’s voice possesses a swelling 
attitude that’s never really come 
to light before.

Remember 
The 
Laughter 

has several short instrumental 
numbers interspersed within 
the 
greater 
album, 
each 

of which act as a unique 
introduction to the songs that 
follow. The transitions between 
the instrumental pieces and 
subsequent songs are so fluid 
that I didn’t even realize the 
two were separate tracks until 

I had a closer look at the album 
list. “Wedding Day,” “Ascent,” 
“Father’s Day” and “Eruption” 
all contain audio recordings that 
conjure up very specific images 
when played in conjunction with 
their counterparts.

The combination that struck 

me the most was “Eruption” and 
“Hope for the World.” Police 
sirens, gunshots and frantic 
screaming are overlaid with the 
voices of an emergency operator 
and a news broadcaster, who are 
both talking about the city of 
Ferguson, Missouri. Toro’s voice 
breaks across the chaos suddenly 
as he sings “Turn off the sound 
of war and hate / Honor the cries 
for a world that decides on love, 
not race.” The contrast between 
the two is especially striking in 
light of recent events.

“Take the World” is another 

positive, 
encouraging 
piece 

that comes just at the right 
time. Toro is passionate but not 
overbearing as he sings “Let’s get 
ready / To fight for what is ours 
/ We can take the world / And 
make it our own.” Faster paced 
instrumentals and thrumming 
bass 
lend 
the 
piece 
vague 

whispers from Toro’s rock past.

Remember the Laughter is a 

testament to Toro’s bountiful 
artistic ability, proof of not only 
his masterful guitar talent but 
also a reaffirmation of his vocal 
prowess.

6A — Wednesday, November 23, 2016
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The 
year 
is 
2100. 
After 

discovering 
the 
root 
of 

intelligence, 
humans 
have 

created 
not 

just 
artificially 

intelligent 
androids, 
but 

truly 
intelligent 

androids.

Not only that, but 

these androids, like 
ourselves in the current day, have 
begun to struggle with cell-phone 
addiction and an obsession with 
social media. A small subset of 
these anthropomorphic, sentient 
robots have begun making music 
as a way of both embracing and 
denouncing the reliance of the 
general populace on technology.

This is the music that London-

based 
label 
PC 
Music 
has 

produced since its founding in 
2013. The formerly independent 
label, now “partnered” — the 
nature of this partnership hasn’t 
been clarified to the public — with 
Columbia Records, is fueled by 
absurdity. It is the manifestation 
of pop taken to its logical 
extreme, making it, in some ways, 
more social experiment than 
sonic experiment, if the two can 
be separated.

Sonically, 
the 
PC 
Music 

mindset 
is 
one 
that 
aims 

for 
instant 
gratification 
and 

more-or-less 
unprecedented 

experimentation 
in 
equal 

measure. 
The 
immediately 

melodic, dance-floor-ready beats 
of A.G. Cook and label-member 
Danny L. Harle juxtapose the 
abrasive 
electro-grunge 
of 

Felicita, 
whose 
most 
recent 

EP feels more like a discarded 
Oneohtrix Point Never release 
than anything else the label has 
released to date.

Though tracks vary widely in 

terms of melodic accessibility 
and the particular organization 
of sound, the sound itself has 
remained constant through PC 

Music’s brief lifetime. Every song 
has a distinctly plastic finish, and 
synths reign supreme, with songs 
generally featuring pitch-shifted, 
heavily auto-tuned, and usually 
female voices; however, PC Music 

has become less 
insistent on these 
features 
with 

the singles on PC 
Music, Vol. 2.

If 
PC 
Music, 

Vol. 1 was a work 
of 
introduction 

and self-discovery, 
then 
PC 
Music, 

Vol. 2 is label-founder Cook (and 
company) in full stride. With 
features by Noonie Bao and Carly 
Rae Jepsen — neither aggressively 
auto-tuned — it feels now more 
than ever as though PC Music is 
on the cusp of breaking into the 
pop mainstream.

The irony of this, of course, 

is 
that 
PC 
Music 
serves 

fundamentally as a criticism 
of pop music, the genre it 
simultaneously and unashamedly 
channels. 
From 
the 
self-

indulgent, overtly sexual work of 
GFOTY (Girlfriend of the Year) 
to 
Hannah 
Diamond’s 
more 

introspective singles, it’s clear 
that PC Music is aiming to craft 
some sort of cultural and social 
criticism. Like the initials “PC” in 
the label’s name, however, we the 
listeners are left more or less in 
the dark as to “what it all means.”

While the mystery surrounding 

the label’s name itself seems 
more or less purely aesthetic, 
PC Music is truly enigmatic in 
nature. Early in the collective’s 
lifetime, there was significant 
media speculation about whether 
Hannah Diamond was and is 
a real person, rather than just 
a 
hyper-polished 
computer-

generated avatar. Many of the 
label’s 
contributors’ 
identities 

— such as Felicita, easyFun, and 
Life Sim, just to name those on 
this particular compilation — are 
left ambiguously up in the air 
and, especially early in the label’s 
existence, Cook was notoriously 
stingy about giving interviews.

Perhaps 
this 
reluctance 

to engage and interact with 
the media was just one more 
contributor 
to 
some 
yet-

unclarified statement. Perhaps 
Cook simply wanted to be sure 
the project had secured itself 
before exporting anything other 
than music. Whatever the case 
may have been, on Vol. 2 this label 
seems either more self-assured 
or more aware of its goals. With 
the 
respective 
successes 
of 

Harle’s “Broken Flowers” and 
Cook’s “Beautiful,” PC Music was 
forced to open itself up, and its 
recent collaboration with Charli 
XCX and current partnership 
with 
Columbia 
Records 
are 

strong indications that they are 
ready to do just that. Now, PC 
Music is balancing accessibility 
— “Supernatural,” “Monopoly,” 
“Broken Flowers” — with more 
pointed commentary such as 
“Fade Away,” “Poison,” “Hi.”

On “Fade Away” and “Hi,” the 

most lyrically valuable tracks 
of PC Music, Vol. 2, Hannah 
Diamond reflects on relationships 
in the modern day and age. On 
“Fade 
Away,” 
she 
questions 

whether “it’s me you like / Or the 
way I make you feel / Alive / But 
so dead inside,” while “Hi” finds 
Diamond playing one half of a 
relationship conducted purely 
over the internet. Here, in some 
of the most poignant lyrics in 
a PC Music song to date, she 
questions how people choose to 
portray themselves in a certain 
way online: “Feels like I miss you 
/ But is it really the real you? / You 
say you’re as real as it gets / What 
do you mean?”

PC Music is still young, and it’s 

difficult to say with any degree 
of certainty who the producers 
behind the music — Harle, Cook, 
GFOTY and Diamond — really 
are, but with the release of PC 
Music, Vol. 2, one thing is certain: 
these young Londoners either 
embody the future of pop music 
or are the earliest heralds of its 
demise as we know it. Whichever 
turns out to be the case, it’s hard 
not to be excited.

‘PC Music’ is the sound of 
futuristic, pure pop power

ALBUM REVIEW

FILM REVIEW

Sometimes it can feel like 

moviegoers 
are 
divided 
into 

two camps: the 
casual viewer and 
the 
enlightened 

critic. 
Popular 

knowledge tells us 
viewers hate the 
pretentiousness 
of the critics and 
critics turn their 
noses down at the 
crass sensibilities of the audiences. 
Wars have raged (okay, not really, 
but many angry articles have been 
written over this, so the point still 
stands) over who movies are truly 
made for — the analysts or Joe 
Normal.

At their worst, most strawman 

form, 
casual 
viewers 
deride 

any form of analytic thought 
or 
non-mainstream 
cinema 

as 
pretentious, 
and 
critics 

dismiss popular movies at the 
outset simply because of their 
widespread appeal. 

This problem comes to a head 

with foreign films. Derided as 
boring and deeply depressing, 
they’re often thought to cater 
only to the tastes of the most 
pretentious of moviegoers, critics 
and that one dude in your English 
class who insists on calling movies 
“films” and has really strong 
opinions about how music died 
the day Britney Spears released 
her first single. Some aspects of 
this perception are fairly earned. 
Captial-F 
Foreign 
Films 
can 

very easily be dull, meandering, 
pretentious and sad. But of course, 
so can American films. 

No matter where the film 

originated, though, the idea that 
a movie is somehow more artful 
or important just because it’s sad, 
slow or subtitled is mostly just 
nonsense. Genre is irrelevant. It 
can be an action movie, a rom-
com or a character drama — as 
long as it’s genuinely empathetic 
and engaging to its audience, the 

movie is functioning in exactly the 
way it’s supposed to.

This being said, the Polish 

film “America” is, at first glance, 
a 
compilation 
of 
everything 

pretentious and grating about 

foreign 
films. 

Directed 
by 

Aleksandra 
Terpinska 
(“Czech 
Swan”), 

“America” 
tells 

the story of two 
teenage girls, Anka 
(Marta Mazurek, 
“Warsaw 
by 

Night”) and Justine (Aleksandra 
Adamska, “Miasto 44”). They 
live in a small Polish town called 
America, 
where 
they 
spend 

their days making up dances 
to American pop songs and 
reenacting scenes from “The 
Matrix.”

Fed up with their negligent 

parents, the girls decide to run 
away from home. They hitchhike 
and are picked up by a series of 
increasingly scummy men, to 
the point where Justine is nearly 
raped in a truck stop motel called 
“The Las Vegas Hotel.”

Make no mistake, this is a heavy 

and dark film. Within the first 
three minutes, we learn that Anka 
and her mother frequently have to 
clean her father up after he’s made 
a drunken mess of himself, and 
that he comes into Anka’s room 
every night and sexually abuses 
her. 

So yes, “America” certainly 

fits the notions most apply to 
foreign films: painful and sad 
against a bleak grey setting. 
And yet, “America” is entirely 
unpretentious, 
lovingly 
made 

and tells a genuinely engaging — 
even haunting — story. Terpinska 
clearly understands that heavy 
subject matter on its own doesn’t 
make a movie meaningful, so 
every frame in the film is carefully 
considered for creating maximum 
emotional effectiveness. In other 
words, “America” is not for critics 
or average moviegoers — it’s for 
everyone.

Movies like “America” (or 

at least, movies that deal with 
such weighty subjects) are often 
voyeuristic and detached, almost 
clinical in their portrayal of 
horrific events. It’s the idea of 
filming a “low” subject matter 
in a highfaluting way, making 
violence, 
pain 
and 
suffering 

appear beautiful and digestible 
by virtue of emotional distance 
between the audience and what is 
happening on screen.

This isn’t necessarily a bad way 

to approach a story, and it works 
really well in a lot of movies — it’s 
essentially the thesis statement 
that 
drives 
David 
Fincher’s 

filmography. And yet, it’s a breath 
of fresh air to find a movie that 
places the audience directly in the 
minds of the characters so that we 
feel what they feel. 

The empathy comes through 

the details of Anka and Justine’s 
friendship. 
The 
outer 
space 

posters in Anka’s bedroom, the 
galaxy print of Justine’s jacket, 
the familiar way they shove each 
other around, the gangster rap 
they listen to — these details are so 
delicate and precise that you can’t 
help but hope for the best for Anka 
and Justine. We see every nuance 
of their jittery excitement when 
they’re standing at the bus stop 
about to leave America; we feel 
every spark of their fear at their 
betrayal. There’s no pretension 
here and no exploitation. Just the 
characters, their feelings and our 
feelings.

“America” is a movie about 

yearning. Justine and Anka want 
more than anything to leave their 
world and live better lives, but 
their hearts are broken over and 
over by all the people they thought 
they could trust the most — their 
parents, the nice young man who 
took them in and even each other. 
It’s such an intimate, personal 
story, but in a way, it’s not unlike 
our country’s, still reeling from 
the events of the last few weeks. 

They wanted the world, and all 

they got was America. They’re not 
the only ones.

Polish ‘America’ is artful, crushing

Statistically 
speaking, 
Joe 

Jonas has had a pretty good 
year. 
After 

brainstorming 
dance-rock band 
DNCE with now-
drummer 
Jack 

Lawless, 
Jonas 

has become the 
front 
man 
of 

the 
four-person 

group. 
Joined 

by guitarists Cole Whittle and 
JinJoo Lee, DNCE released its 
debut single “Cake by the Ocean” 
in September 2015. Since then, 
DNCE has performed during 
FOX’s television special “Grease: 
Live” and opened for Selena 
Gomez during her Revival Tour.

DNCE’s 
self-titled 
debut 

album showcases 14 tracks that 
range from slow acoustic ballads 
to pop-infused dance anthems. 
Opening 
with 
aptly 
named 

“DNCE,” Jonas chants “D-N-
C-E” a cappella before launching 
into a groovy, funky dance 
vibe. Making good use of their 
branding, the bulk of the song 
consists of the lyrics, “Won’t you 
come on D-N-C-E with me.”

“Doctor 
You” 
focuses 
on 

bass guitar and quick lyrics to 
emphasize its sexy club sound. 
But the song speeds up as it 

progresses and falls into a rut of 
sounding extraordinarily similar 
to all the others on the album. 
The chanting in the background 
of the chorus, “Who call the doc? 
/ Said you gonna call the doc?” is 

the only thing to 
distinguish it from 
the rest.

“Blown” 

featuring 
Kent 

Jones, 
continues 

the same musical 
themes, 
building 

up an intensity 
until 
the 
beat 

drops to make way for Jonas’s 
lyrics: “I’ll never let you go / My 
sweet tooth is too strong.” Jones’s 
rap verse adds a new dimension 
to an otherwise cliché sound, but 
it still sounds like a song from the 
closing scene of a Disney Channel 
original movie.

Segueing into “Good Day,” 

the track starts simple and 
acoustically with just claps and 
the mantra that “Today is going 
to be a good day.” The whole song 
stays fairly low and monotone 
throughout the verses, failing to 
progress beyond a happy song to 
wake up to in the morning.

“Almost” is the first slow song 

of the album, transitioning it to 
more introspective and relaxed 
lyrics. Jonas showcases both his 
emotions and his vocal range as 
he sings, “Baby, we were good / 
We were almost perfect,” while 

light vocalizations harmonize in 
the background. “Almost” never 
strays too far from the baseline 
set early on, but gives the listener 
something other than upbeat 
dance hymns to enjoy.

“Naked” 
opens 
with 
an 

aggressively 
electronic 
intro 

and continues to maintain the 
dance-based electric tones. Jonas 
speaks the verses’ lyrics and 
shows off his impressive falsetto 
in the chorus when he sings, “I 
wanna be naked with you / At 
least I’m telling the truth.”

The second acoustic track, 

“Truthfully,” 
tugs 
at 
the 

heartstrings and narrates the 
ups and downs of falling in love 
again. It’s full of cliché metaphors 
and simple phrases such as, 
“Speaking truthfully, I love you 
more than you love me. As DNCE 
channels its inner Taylor Swift, 
“Truthfully” recounts universal 
feelings of love and loss.

Closing 
with 
“Unsweet,” 

DNCE ends the way it began. 
With a few flashes of greatness, 
DNCE never strays from what it 
knows best. As the songs begin 
to blend together, the album 
starts to sound like one long 
dance hymn. With a little more 
initiative and experimentation, 
DNCE could have set itself 
apart from the rest but instead 
falls short of groundbreaking 
and leaves the listener feeling 
slighted.

Peppers, Samuel could decide ‘The Game’

As the world waits to hear 

whether Wilton Speight or John 
O’Korn will start at quarterback 
for 
Michigan 
against 
Ohio 

State, there is a good possibility 
Saturday’s game will be decided 
by something other than who’s 
under center.

To 
have 
a 
chance, 
the 

Wolverines 
will 
need 
more 

out of the quarterback than 
they got against Indiana, when 
O’Korn completed just seven of 
16 passes for 59 yards. But the 
more compelling battle will be 
between Jabrill Peppers and 
Curtis Samuel.

Both are do-it-all players for 

their respective teams, with 
Samuel a versatile force on the 
Buckeyes’ offense and Peppers 
roaming the entire field for 
Michigan. Both would have 
darkhorse cases for the Heisman 
Trophy if Louisville’s Lamar 
Jackson had not all but wrapped 
up the award already. And with 
Peppers expected to see heavy 
time on offense in a must-win 
game for the Wolverines, there 
could be times on Saturday 
where they seem to be locked in a 
hyper-athletic call and response.

There’s even a good possibility 

they could match up against each 
other directly. Peppers works 
as a linebacker, nickelback and 
safety on defense, which means 
he could be tasked with covering 
Samuel out of the backfield or 
split out. And if he does, he’ll be 
responsible for mitigating the 
constant threat Samuel poses.

“People just, they lose their 

technique, they forget about 
their technique … when they’re 
looking at a great athlete,” said 
senior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 

Lewis. “They just throw it out 
the window and just like, ‘Let 
me get this guy covered,’ and not 
think about their technique. So 

that’s really one of the reasons 
he’s one of the best, because he’s 
so athletic and he can get in and 
out of his break so fast.”

Through 11 games this season, 

Samuel has been used heavily 
as both a running back and a 
receiver. He has 84 rushes for 650 
yards, seven touchdowns and a 
staggering 7.7 yards per carry. He 
also has 61 catches for 790 yards 
and seven touchdowns, each of 
which would lead Michigan’s 
entire team.

While those numbers are no 

doubt intimidating, there is a 
silver lining buried in them. If 
the Wolverines can find a way 
to slow down Samuel — easily 
the most dangerous playmaker 
they have faced this season — 
they would be in great position 
to win. Lewis said he expects to 
cover Samuel some on Saturday, 

which is a good indication 
Michigan will throw everything 
it has at him. And that could 
include Peppers.

“I’ve been watching Curtis 

for a while,” Peppers said. “ … 
Phenomenal athlete, strong guy, 
great hands. But you go into it like 
you go (into covering) anybody 
else. Line up. Be fundamental. 
Trust your technique and let 
your athleticism make the plays.”

Peppers should have an outsize 

impact on the game himself. His 
defensive numbers are not as 
gaudy as they were early in the 
season, when he jockeyed for the 
national lead in tackles for loss, 
but he still boasts an impressive 
15 on the year.

And while shutting down 

Samuel would be an invaluable 
contribution, 
Peppers 
will 

likely also need to make an 

impact on offense.

After 
a 
massive 
breakout 

game against Rutgers, teams 
have keyed in on Peppers when 
he’s been in the game. It hasn’t 
been effective enough to stifle 
him completely, but he has seen 
a slight decrease in big plays over 
the second half of the season.

It would be natural to assume 

Michigan was saving Peppers’ 
energy for this week. But he’s 
never 
had 
a 
reputation 
as 

someone with limited energy.

“There was one situation last 

spring ball during our four-hour 
practices when Coach Harbaugh 
first got here where we were all 
beat up, exhausted after a four-
hour practice,” said senior tight 
end Jake Butt, “and it was like 
the middle of spring ball, so it was 
when it was really starting to hit 
us, and we were in a full padded 

practice. It was about the three-
hour mark and Jabrill returned 
a punt during a punt drill, 
returned it like 40 yards, and 
then when he was jogging back to 
go return another one he did like 
a cartwheel, back handspring, 
backflip 360 in full pads.

“I was like, ‘Oh my god, I can’t 

even believe you just did that.’ ”

Those are the stories legends 

are made of, but in a matter 
of days, Peppers will likely 
meet someone who can match 
him. For every big hit or shifty 
return by Peppers, it will be 
just as important to stop a long 
run by Samuel.

In a game that has Big 

Ten, 
national 
and 
maybe 

even 
Heisman 
implications, 

those stars will loom large. 
As Peppers and Samuel go, so 
could The Game.

Michigan ready to empty playbook at Ohio State

Senior 
running 
back 

De’Veon Smith may have been 
exaggerating when he described 
the No. 3 Michigan football team’s 
playbook as being a foot thick and 
2,000 pages long on Tuesday 
night, but there’s no questioning 
that coach Jim Harbaugh’s bag of 
tricks is a deep one.

This 
season 
alone, 
the 

Wolverines have lined up 10 
men behind the ball in the 
now-famous “train” formation, 
run 
the 
read 
option 
with 

redshirt sophomore linebacker 
Jabrill Peppers as a wildcat 
quarterback, brought in third-
string 
quarterback 
Shane 

Morris for the sole purpose of 
being a lead blocker and called 
for a two-point conversion from 
holder Garrett Moores.

But now the long-awaited 

matchup with No. 2 Ohio State 
is on deck, and Peppers hinted 
that fans might not have seen 
anything yet.

“Typically, teams save some 

defensive schemes, offensive 
schemes, special teams schemes 
for 
some 
games,” 
he 
said 

Tuesday. “This one’s for all the 
marbles, so everything we’ve 
got, we’re gonna throw at ’em.”

On the Big Ten’s weekly 

coaches 
teleconference, 

Harbaugh was asked about how 
much preparation throughout 
the year is focused specifically 
on Ohio State, and he kept his 
answer simple: “A lot.”

The Wolverines install new 

plays and modify old ones on a 
weekly basis, depending on the 
coaches’ game plan for their 
opponent. The offense has been 
especially fluid — the four-man 
running back rotation seems to 
have no solid formula except 
for Smith getting a plurality 

of the carries, and many of 
Michigan’s role players have 
seen their usage vary widely 
from week to week.

Some weeks, the offense has 

relied heavily on jet sweeps to 
freshman wide receiver Eddie 
McDoom. Other weeks, the 
quarterback fakes the sweep 
and lets McDoom get open on 
short routes. And sometimes, 
like last week against Indiana, 
the 
Wolverines 
don’t 
use 

McDoom at all.

For obvious reasons, none 

of Michigan’s players delved 
into anything specific they had 
planned for the Buckeyes. Even 

Peppers, one of the offense’s 
main 
wild 
cards, 
merely 

laughed when asked if there was 
anything new in store for him 
this week.

“I guess we’ve gotta see,” he 

said.

According to Peppers, the 

Wolverines are expecting the 
same thing from Ohio State. 
With weapons like quarterback 
J.T. Barrett (whose legs are as 
dangerous as his arm), freshman 
Mike 
Weber 
and 
versatile 

H-back Curtis Samuel under 
the tutelage of an experienced 
coaching staff, the Buckeyes are 
sure to have a few tricks up their 

sleeves as well.

Michigan has seen firsthand 

how a few big plays can change 
a game. A 45-yard touchdown 
from fifth-year senior receiver 
Amara Darboh and a one-
handed 
interception 
from 

senior 
cornerback 
Jourdan 

Lewis — both of which came in 
the fourth quarter — handed the 
Wolverines a 14-7 victory over 
No. 6 Wisconsin. And in a loss 
to Iowa, Michigan held a 10-0 
lead before a safety and some 
big gains on short passes let the 
Hawkeyes get back in the game.

“When our number is called, 

we know they have a talented 

secondary, (but) we know we 
have the players to make plays,” 
Darboh said. “When the ball’s in 
the air, I think it’s on us to go up 
and make the play.”

Especially 
if 
redshirt 

sophomore quarterback Wilton 
Speight turns out to be healthy 
enough to play, creating a few 
more highlight-reel moments 
could be the difference on 
Saturday. And if that means the 
Wolverines have to go deep into 
their vast library of plays, that’s 
what they’ll do.

“Hopefully we run all of 

them,” Smith said. “Every single 
one of them.”

Wolverines headed to U.S. Virgin Islands

Instead of eating turkey, the 

Michigan women’s basketball team 
will be sipping coconut water on 
the beaches of St. Thomas.

The Wolverines flew Tuesday 

morning to the U.S. Virgin Islands 
to 
participate 
in 
a 
marquee 

preseason 
tournament, 
The 

Paradise Jam, from Thursday 
through Saturday. According to 
its website, the Paradise Jam is 
the second-most popular tourist 
attraction for the islands, right 
after Carnival. 

Michigan 
will 
spend 
this 

weekend 
playing 
against 
its 

toughest 
opponents 
of 
the 

season by far: No. 25 Gonzaga on 

Thursday, Winthrop on Friday and 
No. 10 Florida State on Saturday. 
The quick succession of games will 
start a stretch of seven straight 
games on the road, and the whole 
team is bracing for the challenge. 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico said she expects the team 
to be exhausted. “Besides that, 
I think everyone’s going to be 
in kind of a similar boat. It’s an 
exciting opportunity for us to 
take our team to a place where 
most of them haven’t been and to 
experience a little bit of time away 
from Ann Arbor. 

“Part of the college experience 

is having a great opportunity to do 
this. It’s going to be great for our 
team, and we’ll have some time 
to spend with each other away 

from where we’ve been for the last 
couple of months.” 

The Wolverines won their most 

recent contest against Western 
Michigan on Monday with a final 
tally of 66-40. Though the margin 
was considerable, Michigan had 
just made program history by 
scoring more than 100 points in 
three straight games, with the 
closest of those wins by 38 against 
Oakland on Nov. 11. 

Gonzaga just made it onto the 

Associated Press Top 25 list, but 
the Bulldogs are definitely worthy 
of their berth. They are coming off 
the program’s first win at Stanford, 
which has lost just eight games at 
home since 2007.

Forward 
Jill 
Barta 
leads 

Gonzaga with 16 points per 

game. The redshirt sophomore 
was just named the West Coast 
Conference Player of the Week 
for her performance against the 
Cardinals, where she shot 8-for-10 
from the field. 

“It’s going to be interesting 

because Gonzaga is an experienced, 
long team that’s going to pose some 
problems for us,” Barnes Arico 
said. “They’re really experienced 
and real good post players and 
really play well together. They’re 
coming off a great win at Stanford.” 

The Wolverines received 36 

points in the coaches’ poll — just 
one slot away from making it onto 
the list.

Next up after the Bulldogs 

will be Winthrop, which is on a 
three-game losing streak. The 
Eagles are having trouble with 
depth and turnovers. Against 
their most recent opponent, 
East Tennessee, only one player 
reached double digits. 

To finish out the series, the 

Wolverines face the Seminoles, 
who boast guard Brittany Brown 
— currently the only Florida State 
player to garner 500 rebounds, 
300 assists and 200 steals. The 
Seminoles’ other asset is Shakayla 
Thomas, who has led her team 
in points in three out of the four 
games this season. 

“So each night will be a little 

bit different,” Barnes Arico said. 
“I think we need to just try to take 
advantage of our strengths and try 
to continue and go in transition and 
use our speed and use our ability to 
score the basketball.”

The short turnaround between 

Western Michigan on Monday and 
Gonzaga on Thursday won’t leave 
much room to practice or work on 
details. Sophomore center Hallie 
Thome voiced concern about the 
Wolverines’ starts. 

Thome does believe, however, 

that the team mindset will be a 
true asset for Michigan. Despite 
impressive players like junior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty, no one 
player is concerned about stuffing 
the stat sheet. 

“We’re very excited to play 

more competition,” senior Siera 
Thompson said. “This is a test for 
us, and we’re all prepared. 

“We’re so excited to just enjoy 

the sunshine. And those hotel beds.”

Senior Derrick Walton Jr. and Michigan are out of town again Wednesday.
‘M’ travels south for 
first true road game

The last time the Michigan 

men’s basketball team played an 
opponent from the Southeastern 
Conference, 
former 
Kentucky 
guard Aaron 
Harrison 
stuck 
a 

dagger in the 
Wolverines’ 
heart, hitting 
a 
3-pointer 

with 
two 

seconds 
left, 
sinking 

Michigan’s 
hope 
of 

making 
consecutive 
Final Fours.

The stakes 

will not be nearly as high 
when the Wolverines (4-0) 
travel to South Carolina (4-0) 
on Wednesday, but that won’t 
make Michigan take this early-
season clash lightly.

After two decisive victories 

in New York over Marquette 
and Southern Methodist, the 
25th-ranked Wolverines hope 
the momentum from their 
impressive display in the Big 
Apple will carry over as they 
face their first true road test of 
the season.

The Gamecocks also enter 

Wednesday 
undefeated 

through four games, but they 
have 
taken 
some 
punches 

getting to this point.

South 
Carolina 
needed 

a 
buzzer-beater 
to 
beat 

Monmouth at home last week, 
after 
it 
blew 
an 
18-point 

second-half lead and allowed 
the Hawks to come back and 
force overtime.

South Carolina still has the 

pieces to go toe to toe with 
Michigan, 
though. 
Guard 

Sindarius 
Thornwell 
leads 
the 

Gamecocks 
in 
scoring, 

putting 
up 

21 points per 
game thus far.

At 
6-foot-

5, 
Thornwell 

will 
be 
one 

of 
the 
taller 

guards 
the 

Wolverines 
have 
faced 
to 

date, and he will give junior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman and senior guard 
Zak Irvin a difficult defensive 
assignment. South Carolina 
expects to get a performance 
out of Thornwell similar to 
what Michigan gets out of 
Irvin, a solid shooter who has 
many offensive capabilities 
and 
can 
hold 
his 
own 

defensively as well.

“(Thornwell) is a consistent 

35- to 40-percent shooter 
over 
his 
career,” 
said 

Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“(Thornwell and Irvin) are 
two seniors that really know 
how to play. He’s probably 
shooting the ball a little bit 
better than Zak is right now. 
I don’t know if his assist-to-
turnover is quite as good, but 
he’s just a good player. When 
you have a senior that’s been 
starting for a few years, that’s 

what (he) should be.”

Guard PJ Dozier, who hit 

the 
winning 
shot 
against 

Monmouth, brings a skill set 
and body similar to Thornwell’s 
that could also trouble the 
Wolverines. Beilein tried to 
recruit Dozier to Michigan 
back when the guard was in 
prep school, but due to family 
ties, Dozier chose to play for 
the Gamecocks.

“I saw him as a multi-

position player,” Beilein said. 
“A guy that was more (Caris 
LeVert)-like who could see 
the floor. He’s just a player, a 
6-(foot)-6 player.”

In the frontcourt, forwards 

Chris Silva and Maik Kotsar 
will match up better with the 
Wolverines than Marquette 
or Southern Methodist did. 
Silva is the more dangerous of 
the pair, averaging 10 points 
and 
seven 
rebounds. 
The 

6-foot-9 forward will most 
likely be guarded by junior 
forward 
DJ 
Wilson, 
who 

has been Michigan’s most 
versatile defender through its 
opening games.

The Wolverines will also be 

exposed to the most aggressive 
defense they have seen so far 
this season. South Carolina 
currently tops the SEC in 
rebound 
margin, 
grabbing 

12.5 more boards than its 
opponents each game, while 
also forcing an average of 14 
turnovers. With that said, 
Michigan will have to limit 
the Gamecocks in transition, 
especially having to watch for 
outside shooting threats.

“Although (South Carolina 

is) not big in steals, they are a 
pressure team,” Beilein said. 
“And they’re going to try and 
run us out of our stuff, and 
we’ve got to be really good 
making that extra pass. We 
need to keep our turnovers 
down. They’re forcing 14 or 

15 
turnovers 

a game. They 
also have 14 or 
15 a game so 
if we can play 
one 
of 
those 

games 
where 

we’re at nine or 
10 turnovers … 
we’ll be in good 
shape.”

South 

Carolina will be 

a tough test for the Wolverines, 
especially on the road. But 
handling the Gamecocks may 
only be part of the challenge 
Michigan 
will 
face 
in 

Columbia. After their triumph 
in New York, the Wolverines 
will need to stay grounded, 
as 
excitement 
around 
the 

program has risen to levels 
unseen since that game against 
Kentucky in the Elite Eight.

“In 
the 
grand 
scheme 

of 
college 
basketball, 
we 

haven’t 
done 
anything,” 

said 
senior 
guard 
Derrick 

Walton Jr. “I think everyone 
has a great sense of that and 
nobody’s walking around and 
lollygagging and saying we’ve 
accomplished anything. We 
haven’t accomplished anything 
because there’s still a good 
25 to 30 games left. We’re 
excited about what we have 
accomplished, and we’re just 
eager for more.”

“In the grand 
scheme ... we 
haven’t done 
anything.”

Michigan renews series with Lakers

When the Central Collegiate 

Hockey Association disbanded 
in 2013, Lake Superior State and 
Michigan’s 
hockey teams 
were 
split 

into 
separate 

conferences. 
This weekend, 
for 
the 
first 

time since the 
conference 
breakup, 
the 

two teams will 
face off again.

The former 

rivalry 
was 

not 
only 

bred from how often the teams 
played each other, but also by the 
competitiveness of each team. In 
an 11-year span from 1988-1998, 
the teams combined to win five 
national titles.

“They were really good, and 

we were pretty good, too,” said 
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“A lot of our games were 
showdown games in the race for 
first place. Of course, we were in 
the same conference, so we were 
playing them four times a year.

“Lake (Superior) State was 

a benchmark team. If we had a 
winning record against them, 
that meant we were a good team 
— like a good team nationally.”

Since then, the Lakers (6-6-0) 

have seen some struggles. The 
program has suffered through 
four 
straight 
losing 
seasons 

including an 8-28-2 mark in 
2014-15 — current head coach 
Damon Whitten’s first season.

This year, Lake Superior State 

— somewhat like the Wolverines 
(5-4-1) — has been inconsistent. 
The Lakers jumped out to a 6-1 
start this season. Over that time, 
the team outscored its opponents 
35-16, and rose to No. 20 in the 
USCHO.com poll.

After 
that, 
they 
have 

struggled, losing five games in a 
row heading into their matchup 
with Michigan.

Despite 
its 
recent 
losing 

stretch, Lake Superior State 
still 
boasts 
the 
ninth-best 

scoring offense in the country. 
And though the Wolverines are 
conscious of the Lakers’ offensive 
potency, 
they 

have 
kept 

the 
focus 
on 

themselves.

“We’ve 
been 

really 
focused 

on 
our 
own 

systems 
and 

kind of working 
off the (Boston 
University) 
weekend 
and 

going off of that,” 
said senior defenseman Nolan 
De Jong. “Everyone looks at the 
stats, and everyone looks at the 

scores, so we know they’re going 
to be able to score a lot of goals. 
But we’ve been really focused 
on our defense and making sure 
we’re a solid unit back there.”

So far this year, that unit has 

been solid. Michigan has the 
ninth-ranked scoring defense 
in the country, keyed in part 

by 
strong 

goaltending 
play. 
Freshman 

Hayden Lavigne 
has 
been 

especially stout, 
as he has the best 
save percentage 
in the country at 
.956.

Michigan’s 

game 
against 

Lake 
Superior 

State comes after somewhat of a 
down period for the Wolverines. 
They played just one exhibition 

game against the United States 
National 
Team 
Development 

Program’s U-18 team this past 
weekend 
and 
will 
have 
an 

early Thursday practice before 
taking the rest of the day off for 
Thanksgiving.

Though that bit of rest can be 

nice for a team in the midst of a 
long season, it is still a long break 
between meaningful games. And 
that’s a break that Michigan is 
excited to end.

“Bye weeks are nice, but you 

look at how many times we 
practice, and it’ll be 11 times 
before we get to play an actual 
two-game series again,” De 
Jong said. “Maybe it’s a bit of 
a refresher just to kind of get 
away for a second, and then get 
back at it. But I think we’re all 
excited to get back and play a 
two-game series and get in the 
groove again.”

How To: Pledging for Unity in the Face of Divisiveness 

B Y S Y LVA N N A G R O S S

the
tangent

I

’m sure you’re really tired of hearing more about 
President-elect Donald Trump. Good, because this 
isn’t about him. This is about me.

So, I’m obviously going to start with an inspirational 

quote that I did not say.

“My mom used to say, ‘You can’t fall off the floor’ ” 

— Bakari Sellers, vice chairman of the South Carolina 
Democratic Party.

This past weekend I traveled to Washington, D.C. 

to participate as a representative of the University 
of Michigan Hillel in the General Assembly of the 
Jewish Federations of North America. It was a little life 
changing and it’s where I heard Sanders speak.

At the GA — that’s the cool, hip abbreviated way to 

say it — I got to sit four rows away from Supreme Court 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (who claimed that she is 
proud to be the Notorious RBG), to Skype with Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to be in contact with 
congressman Ted Deutch (D—FL), to be front row at a 
Kafe Shahor Hazak (“Strong Black Coffee” in Hebrew) 
hip-hop concert and to participate in multiple breakout 
sessions on philanthropy, media during the presidential 
election and the Jewish voice in Israel.

Just pointing out, the above paragraph is only one 

sentence. Haters back off.

In one of the breakout sessions, I sat in the audience 

of a panel filled with two Jewish African Americans, 
Yavilah McCoy and Gamal Palmer and Sellers, a 
political commentator for CNN. McCoy was strong in 
her stance to inspire us to march forward confident in 
our identities, Palmer preached the value of respecting 
those identities and Sellers spoke of his belief that we 
will all be all right.

Expectedly, I walked away feeling inspired.
I also had the chance to visit, as a part of the first 

Jewish group, the National Museum of African 
American History and Culture. The exclusivity of the 
NMAAHC (the museum is booked through March) can 
be equated to Hamilton, but it’s worth it. The museum is 
breathtakingly amazing.

But the main point of this article is about a meaningful 

conversation I had the day after visiting the museum 

with some fellow Michiganders. In brief, we spoke about 
how amazing the museum was, but how we did not think 
we felt the same impact because of the privilege of our 
skin. We spoke about how that wasn’t inherently bad to 
not understand the full weight of the museum, as we are 
sure others do not feel the same impact when they visit 
the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum or Yad 
Vashem in Israel. Though the Jewish voice is entwined 
with the Civil Rights movement in America, it is not the 
spotlight. We cannot claim that.

Within this conversation among Jewish women, I 

want to point out two major points.

The first is that we spoke about it. We talked and 

explained how we were affected and how we felt while 
maintaining the sanctity of those who were directly 
affected. The second is that we were there and we were 
inspired. We didn’t “otherize” ourselves, as Sellers puts 
it, or stake claim to why we were being marginalized. 
Because. We. Weren’t. 

I came away from that weekend making a pledge 

to myself that I will do what I think is right. I made a 
pledge to worry about my neighbor as much as I worry 
about myself. And I made a pledge to be a part of the 
conversation, and if conversation is too little, the fight.

I know so much has been written already in the 

past week, and my voice isn’t adding much to the 
conversation. But this is as much a pledge to you as it 
is to myself. I have not mentioned political names sans 
the introduction, I have not discussed the election 
and I have not mentioned party names. I am a future 
lawyer, I see both conservative and liberal viewpoints 
and though I highly lean in one direction, I do not judge 
those who lean in the other. I believe in democracy and 
I believe in each other.

One day, I might look back and be regretful I chose to 

be very careful with my words in this column. And be 
regretful that I did not voice everything that I wanted 
to. But in truth, I don’t think I will. McCoy said this to 
us: “This is a time for action, not for words.” And I hope 
whoever knows me will attest in these coming years, as 
I become a real adult, that my actions will be just and my 
words will be few.

At the GA, a very common dialogue was, “We have 

not forgotten,” to remind ourselves that as the Jewish 
community we have not forgotten our past. And so it 
is our duty to now stand up and protect those whose 
future is in danger.

As a Jewish woman, I have not forgotten.
And now is not a time to keep quiet and forget, either. 

Your economic status is not more important than the 
safety and security of the person next to you. Your 
political agenda is not more important than the safety 
and security of the person next door. Your beliefs about 
Israel, the Islamic State, in building a wall or others is 
not more important than the safety and security of your 
friends and family.

I have faith in America. I am not being naive, and I am 

not succumbing to the disillusionment of this nation. 
I do not see the danger in my day-to-day life, but that 
does not mean it does not exist. I call on you to speak 
up and be heard as we enter into the real world. We are 
the future. We must be the change and break from our 
liberal bubble and see the world for what it is, and not 
what it should be.

Listen to Sellers’ mom.

L

ast winter, I struggled with writing an 
application for a program that I desperately 
wanted to be admitted to. The most fundamental 

section of the application consisted of five personal 
short answer questions. Once I had settled on the 
ideas I wanted to express in my responses, I faced a 
whole new challenge: how to write them. I wrote 
freely and tried not to get in my own way, but faced 
a few worries when I went back to revise. This 
application was supposed to reflect me — but could it 
reflect me too much? I wanted to use a strikethrough 
and a few parenthetical asides, but would these cross 
some kind of invisible line separating acceptable from 
too personal? I struggled with deciding how much 
to allow myself as a person to come through in my 
answers. And by struggled, I mean struggled. I was 
doing homework at the same table as a few friends at 
the time, and I interrupted all of them to ask for help. 
I called my mom to talk to her about it. I may have 
sought advice via text.

As a copy editor, my job is to proofread. My job is to 

fact-check, to look closely at grammar and syntax and 
to intuitively understand how to polish articles before 
they go on to be published in our newspaper. While I’m 
not necessarily editing for voice, editors still want to 
make sure that the tone of the Daily pieces follow the 
professional standard we strive to uphold. In this role, 
my waffling and questioning disappears. I trust myself 
to read the work of others and suggest a rewrite for 
clarity or a change in punctuation. I love this position. 
I am at my most confident in the writing process when 
I’m reading work with a critical eye.

Obviously, reading the work of others and revising 

your own work are two completely different situations. 
My hesitancy in my application is only one instance 
of many in which I struggled with how to write. I 
have hit this obstacle in many of my other writings, 
some academic, some personal. It’s not that I’m 
uncomfortable with my ability to write. The problem 
is rooted in indecisiveness, in an inability to commit 
to my voice and move forward with the text, whether 
that be an application, an email or a tweet.

For many writers, writing is deeply personal. It’s 

almost impossible to distance yourself enough from 
your own work to revise it fairly. I strongly believe 
that it is always valuable to have another person (or a 
few people) review your work. However, questioning 
my own voice was getting in the way of my writing. 
It was drawing me away from how I wanted to write 
and toward this undefined notion of how I thought 
I should write. Even as I asked for advice about the 
strikethrough and parenthetical phrases, I knew that 
I wasn’t really unsure of these devices. I liked them 
and wanted to use them. Frankly, I thought they were 
funny, and laughing at my own jokes is a pretty key 
part of my personality. I wasn’t looking for deciding 
votes from the people I asked — I was looking for 
permission to be myself in my writing.

After thinking about how much time I spent asking 

for someone to give me the go-ahead to write the way 
I was comfortable writing, I realized that something 
had to change. While I wasn’t going to be able to get 
the distance in my own writing and revising that I 
have when I’m editing articles for the Daily, I had to 
try and let myself be both a writer and an editor. I had 
to trust my writing skills and my voice. I had to trust 
my experience reading with a critical eye and use it for 
my own work. The goal was never to be able to write 
a perfect piece of work on my own, but to manage to 
free myself from the strange limbo I encountered each 
time I couldn’t decide if I was crossing a line into using 
my individual voice too much.

I want to turn in papers that adhere to high academic 

standards, of course. But I also want to turn in papers 
that I’m happy with personally. I’m not at the place yet 
where I’ve stopped asking for approval entirely. I still 
text my mom asking for help with emails. I might not 
ever be able to stop questioning completely, but I’m 
doing better. I don’t have any authority on this matter 
beyond my own personal experience. With that in 
mind, if there’s something I’m trying to remind myself 
of on a regular basis because of the demands of being 
an English major, it’s this: don’t be afraid to write 
yourself into your paper.

THOUGHT BUBBLE: MOTIVATION

“I am motivated by my mom. Although she 

has passed, I still feel her pushing me to reach 

new goals and become the best version of 

myself. Every day, I wake up wanting to make 

her proud. Since I don’t have the opportunity 

to talk to my mom, I have to believe that she 

is a part of the opportunities and blessings 

that happen to me; that this is her way of 

communicating with me. I don’t want to take 

one of these for granted. This is the constant 

force that drives me to work towards my future. 

Whatever that future may be, I know my mom 

was watching over me and I will continue work 

to make her proud.”

Everyone says it: Print is dead. Newspapers across the country 

have been going through a process of intense change, as their 
primary method of distribution moves from print to digital. 
But my position as a managing design editor for The Michigan 
Daily means that I lay out the front page for the print version of 
a paper, design the layout of photos, the creation of graphics. I 
create the look of the paper, the feel of it. Looking at myself and 
my work for the Daily through I wondered how many before me 
had toiled over that front page, and how few may follow. I was 
conflicted. I don’t subscribe to the pure nostalgia some hold for 
the screenless days, when books were the primary source of 
information. While it’s easy to dramatize the transition from 
print to digital using terms like death, I understood the very 
real benefits. What I didn’t understand is how this transition 
would change my relationship with the design of the paper. 
Would seeing how many clicks I got on a page mean as much 
as seeing a stranger holding up the newspaper I had designed 
the night before? Is there a value shift when the paper ceases 
to be an object? Can I still say I made something? If I couldn’t 
control what was happening, maybe I could at least understand 
it. Perhaps I could understand the ways that the paper has 
changed over time as technology advanced. And I found some 

answers in a library basement with a bearded man named Fritz.

***

One of the Daily’s copy editors had told me about the 

man who runs the printing press for the Wolverine Press, a 
letterpress shop operated by Fritz Swanson, a lecturer in the 
English Department. Apparently he had been there so long that 
when choosing his own uniqname and email he was able to pick 
whatever three letters he wanted. The editor told me he had 
showed her trays of old metal blocks of type, which they use 
to make books, and showed her how to use them. That’s when 
I realized I had no idea how the newspaper was actually made. 
When I was finished designing at the end of each night I simply 
sent over the InDesign file to the printer, and when I woke up 
10,000 copies just magically appeared on stands throughout 
the campus. I drafted an email to Fritz’s three-letter address 
asking if he could take a few minutes of his time to explain 
printing presses and how they have changed since the Daily 
began printing in 1890.

At 10 a.m. on a Thursday, I wandered through the basement 

of the Duderstadt Library looking for Conference Room 100. 
The only people I know who go to a North Campus library 
are in the College of Engineering. Even though I am a senior, 

the space is dark and unfamiliar to me. The fluorescent lights 
flickered on the cement block walls. As I scanned the glass 
enclosed rooms lining the central space, I saw a black metal 
machine. It was an old letterpress. Smaller than I expected, 
maybe the size of a kitchen island, it was meant for personal, 
not industrial, use. I grabbed my pen and notebook and entered 
the room. Three people were engrossed in conversation, which 
I interrupted. They stared at me. There were two men and one 
woman. Each man had a beard — one, old and silver, the other, 
young and dark. Having heard the story about him being at the 
University for such a long time, I turned to the man with the 
silver beard and said, “I’m Francesca Kielb, from The Michigan 
Daily.” He looked confused. The younger man stuck out his 
hand and introduced himself. “I’m Fritz.”

***

The room was covered in shelves filled with tiny metal 

blocks. Each shelving unit was a different font, each drawer a 
different weight of a respective font (bold, bold italic, medium, 
medium italic, etc.) These were the types of building blocks 
used for all print materials created between 1450 and 1950. 
This small room in the basement library was transformed into 
a letterpress studio, which were once in common use, and the 

three people in the room facilitated this travel back in time.

When I mentioned that I was from The Michigan Daily, the 

woman, Rebecca Chung perked her head up. She said she was 
an editor at The Michigan Daily from 1985 to 1987. According to 
Rebecca, that period of time saw the greatest change in the way 
that the paper was made.

“One year we were using typewriters and the next we were 

using Macs,” Rebecca explained to me. Her presence in this 
room suggested where her preference lay. I asked why, given the 
grueling process, she preferred the years she used a typewriter.

“Typewriter method allowed you and forced you to think 

concisely,” she said. “Everything I learned about editing I 
learned from The Michigan Daily. We were brutal.”

I thought back to the night before, which I had spent at 

my design desk, on one of the iMacs that populate the Daily’s 
newsroom. Nights usually begin with a meeting of all the 
section editors. I find out from News which stories they want 
to put on the front page, and I talk with Photo about which 
images they want to highlight. I then confirm if we have any 
infographics or illustrations for the night, then oversee the 
design and layout of all special inserts. The night always ends 
with a call to the printers; after the articles have made their way 
through rounds of senior editors, managing editors and Copy; 
after I lay out the photos, place the articles on the front page 
and organize the spill; after the infographics and illustrations 
are exported as JPEGs so that they can be viewed online. After 
all of that, once the call happens, only four people remain in the 
room. I save the pages on one of the iMacs. The editor-in-chief 
dials the number. “Did you get everything?” she speaks into the 
phone. “The pages are all there? Great, have a great night!” She 
hangs up. Then she announces to the few of us left, “We made a 
paper!” Now, I imagined creating pages without our library of 
templates, without the ability to drag and drop, without auto-
settings that ensure the text is always aligned and properly 
sized. What would my night have looked like?

***

Fritz pulled up a chair and began his story. It started with 

the letterpress. “You’ve worked in letterpress?” he asked. I gave 
a nervous laugh and said “a little bit.” I have seen someone else 
print a poster once but never actually done anything myself. 
But in that moment it felt like a lie. Over email I made it clear I 
wanted to learn, but then, sitting in that basement in a wrinkled 
blouse, clutching my pen and notebook while holding up my 
recording app on my iPhone, I wanted to be taken seriously. 
“It’s a relief printing process. It’s a recombinant process,” he 
continued without skipping a beat, “What Gutenberg did that 
was special was he created a system for casting metal type 
and being able to rearrange it. You’ve seen metal type before? 
You’ve handled it?” “Yes,” I replied, again stretching my 
single interaction with a press into some actual experience. I 
nodded a lot. He told me that while letterpresses had been used 
on smaller scales since the mid-1400s, newspapers were an 
18th-century invention.

Imagine a room. You are a worker, surrounded by other 

workers and their trays. You place letter by letter by hand, 
forming words which eventually form paragraphs that 
eventually form columns that eventually form one page. You 
can smell the metal. And it gets worse. The whole page has 
to be laid out backwards in order for it to appear properly on 
the paper that gets pressed onto it — thus why it is called relief 
printing. So you are letter by letter forming an illegible inverse 
of the actual page, and if the tray is so much as slightly knocked 
during the chaos of the creation process, the tiny metal letters 
will fall and scatter onto the floor — and you will have to start 
from scratch. I’m struck by the physicality of it, people making 
something with their hands. To them, I imagine, what I do has 
nothing to do with the making of a paper. To them, I imagine, 
my work is so far removed that it might as well be displayed the 
way it was created — on a screen.

Fritz divides the newspaper’s constraints at this time into 

three categories: labor, materials and time, or how many 
people can work in that space and for how long, how many sets 
of metal type can be bought and stored at one time and how 
quickly can the pages be assembled. The design of the front 
page is merely “a consequence of those pressures,” he said. For 
example, the size of a newspaper today stems from the size that 
was convenient for one man to make in a mold in the 17th and 
18th century. The sheet sizes were set by the manufacturer and 
were essentially determined by ergonomics — the largest size 
that was still manageable for a single worker to handle. Every 
change, every cut or adjustment to this set size was another 
added process, meaning added work and time. Making a paper 
that filled an entire sheet, then, was the most efficient and 
cost effective solution. As Fritz put it, it’s “the reason why a 
newspaper is a newspaper, and not a news book. That is why 
magazines didn’t come about until much later in the game. Thus 
18th-century constraints have determined the sizing standards 
for an era with infinite possibilities.” These conditions are why 
my InDesign file that I drag and click and arrange each night is 
the size and shape that it is. There is no other reason.

And it doesn’t end with the paper size. Why is text arranged 

into narrow columns in newspapers rather than into a wider 
setting like books? There is a reason for The Michigan Daily’s 
ultra-condensed, four-column design on its original front 
pages in 1890. On the tray where text was laid out there would 
be set galleys, or channels built up on the press to divide the 
words — metal lines of separation — making columns a norm in 
newspaper printing.

At this point Rebecca steps in. “When I was working at the 

Daily, I didn’t realize it,” she said. “But we had those cases, I 
had to send copy down by 6 o’clock at night, and then we had 
a typesetter named Lucius, Lucius Doyle, and he was grouchy 
and mean and tough and we loved him. Once he was done doing 
the hot metal setting, we would go look at it there and we would 
look at a print and we would make final decisions. The more 
metal involved, the fewer corrections he was willing to make.”

She paused, recalling the year before they transitioned to the 

Mac.

“I had no idea that I cared about it so much while I was 

there,” Rebecca said. “It was all just sinking in. But I’ll let you 
two get back to talking.”

She returned to her work setting up the new letterpress 

studio. Her self-realization prompted internal debate. Why do 
I care that the digital file I create gets duplicated 10,000 times 
on paper? Why does it matter that I can pick it up on my way to 
class and hold it in my hands? Why is that more meaningful to 
me that pulling it up on a screen? And lastly, will I care like she 
cares when it dies?

“I’m glad she brought that up,” Fritz adds. “Because the Daily 

was still set — do you know about the linotype machine at all?”

I lie, laugh awkwardly and say, “A little.”
I think he knows by now what my responses really mean, 

because he explains it anyway. He explains that columns such 
as ads would stay set up week to week to save labor. But in the 
meantime the rest still had to be constructed by hand — that 
is, until the linotype machine was made in the 1880s (though 
not broadly used until the early 20th century.) Now, instead 
of hand placing each letter, you could use a typewriter. Each 
letter you pressed on the typewriter would prompt that same 
letter in real life, in metal block form, to slide down into a line 
on the newspaper tray. You could type a single line of text, then 
that text would be cast in metal together into what was called a 
slug. Now, say you trip and the tray spills on the floor. Instead of 
having tons of individual letters scattered everywhere, you had 
complete lines, formed together, which could be picked up and 
rearranged again back to the proper order. This one machine 
cut work time significantly.

This development explains why the column grid begins 

to loosen up in the early 20th century. The linotype was able 
to adjust the length of the lines (or slugs) that were cast, and 

therefore headlines begin to span multiple columns and 
graphics begin to enter into the designs because there was 
no longer hand-setting of pages. The efficiency allowed for 
flexibility. Yet it is important to note that, while minor changes 
have been made, papers continue to stick with essentially the 
same columns that were made 150 years prior.

Fritz paused. It had been more than 30 minutes and I 

apologized for keeping him from the letterpress. He told me he 
needed to get back to it soon, but wanted to finish the story. I 
looked up and saw the other two time travelers in the room, 
tinkering with the letterpress machine and organizing stacks 
of hand-printed papers on a table.

He finished the story.
“It was probably a roller manufacturer in the 1950s who 

observed this effect first,” Fritz said. “If you print onto a glossy 
surface — like plastic — then if you press that glossy surface 
back onto paper, it will deposit that ink.”

The capability to print with ink on plastic meant that presses 

no longer had the restrictions of metal type, and paper could 
instead be rolled through cylinders and printed. This technique 
of drawing paper through cylinders meant that the paper could 
be fed much more quickly, further improving the efficiency of 
production.

Imagine you have been working a letterpress all of your 

life. You are accustomed to the metal blocks of type, the trays. 
You hold onto it for as long as you can, but eventually you just 
can’t compete. Offset presses are taking over. They demand 
less labor, they require simpler tools and they take less time. 
It’s a no-brainer. Fritz told me The New York Times, despite 
changing technology, printed on a letterpress until 1977. There 
was a video shot by one of the linotype operators about the last 
day of production on a letterpress.As I heard this, I sat there 
and wondered, is that heroic, to be the last to stick to a dying 
technology?

I was nervous to bring up the potential ecological benefit of 

print’s death to a man setting up a letterpress, but I was curious 
to hear his perspective and surprised by his response. 

“We are in a position now where you should only print things 

that you have to print — that must be in print … so how can we 
make this more utilitarian, more functional, more useful?” he 
said. “How can we leverage print so that we are not just echoing 
the past mindlessly?” 

I didn’t expect that from a man who has dedicated his life 

to print. Fritz knew that the cost of printing was high — not 
just financially. He was not of the mindset that business should 
just continue as usual, quite the contrary. His was a mandate: to 
understand the past and not press repeat, to ask questions and 
to print that that must be in print.

But how do we determine what must be in print? Does our 

small, local, student run newspaper make that cut and — if 
so, why? Time passes, and the restrictions that originally 
demanded every design decision no longer exist, yet the 
conventions linger on, a remnant of technologies long buried. 
Print design may just be a remnant of history based on prior 
necessity, repeated blindly. Because, while I may have changed 
fonts, increased graphics and enlarged photos, there are still 
six, thin columns of text on our front page. Does that deserve 
to be repeated 10,000 times a day? When I got up to leave, Fritz 
went searching through the drawers and pulled out a small 
piece of cardstock. On it was every letter and number from 
his favorite font, Kennerley. He had set each letter of metal 
type, one by one, on the letterpress and printed it by hand. He 
reached out and gave it to me.

I held it in my hands. It was beautiful.

A design editor reflects on the history and nature of print

I

’m going to tell you a story. A romantic story, one 
including star-crossed lovers, international travel 
and defying odds and cultural barriers. However, I 

will warn you now, the end of this seemingly perfect story 
is yet to be determined.

The scene opens on an island on the west coast of 

Norway, a few hours south of Bergen, the country’s 
second-largest city. An American girl arrives with four 
11-year-olds in tow, nervous, but ready for the month-
long adventure she’s signed up for as a leader at a utopic 
international children’s village. Romance is the last thing 
on her mind. The hugs and kisses of 11-year-olds seem 
like all she will ever need to feel full and loved.

Enter Fredrik. The Norwegian leader from Bergen. 

The sole male leader in a group of 10 strong women. Tall, 
blonde-haired, blue-eyed, great with kids — a real Prince 
Charming. He meets the American girl, but it wasn’t love 
at first sight. As she would later discover, he didn’t think 
he’d enjoy her company at all — she seemed so American 
and “too happy” (whatever that means). But isn’t that 
how all good love stories go? Two totally different people 
from totally different worlds, magnetized by fate despite 
the odds stacked against them?

It certainly wasn’t easy for these two, this 

modern-day Romeo and Juliet. Although mutual 
feelings (or at least attraction) developed almost 
immediately, both were drawn into the vortex of 
rumors and drama that only a group of almost 
50 preteens can create. She was sure that he 
preferred the Brazilian leader (of course), 
and he was quite positive she had her eye on 
the only other adult male at camp — another 
Norwegian, this one a staff member — who 
the kids were already trying to couple 
with our unwilling heroine. One night, in a 
horrific and embarrassing twist of fate, while 
the adults played a game aimed at revealing 
deep, dark secrets, the girl made a costly error. 
After spending a promising stomach-butterfly-
filled day walking in the mountains with the 
only boy on her mind, she made a mistake 
during the game that led to the widely held 
belief that she had feelings for the wrong 
Norwegian. She spent the rest of the night 
with a pit in her stomach, telling anyone who 
would listen that it was a mistake, hoping it 
would make it back to Fredrik, but all in vain. 
He spent the rest of the night fuming, telling 
himself that he would stop his feelings for 
her in their tracks.

They went on like this for many weeks, “coincidentally” 

sitting next to each other at every meal, volunteering for 
the same activities, the same groups. They had separately 
reached the same conclusion: It simply wasn’t meant to 
be.

Until Gala Night, that is. The second to last night of 

camp. Everyone dressed up, the girls flaunting fancy hair 
and makeup, the boys pretending to shave their baby-
smooth faces and spraying on enough cologne to drop a 
horse. Fancy dinner, games, dancing. Fredrik’s station, 
coincidentally, was right next to the girl’s, and they spent 
all night making moon eyes at each other and wishing 
they were together, knowing that their time was short. 
Soon they would once again be a million miles and worlds 
apart, back to their normal lives like the other had never 
existed.

Later that night, with the kids put grudgingly to bed, 

the leaders had a little farewell party of their own. They 
took a few bottles of wine down to the rocky ledge of the 
fjord, and talked and played games under the Norwegian 
midnight sun, enjoying each other’s company, squeezing 
as many memories as possible into their few remaining 
hours.

The girl had conveniently forgotten to bring a raincoat, 

and who came to her rescue? Fredrik, of course. He 
offered her a seat next to him, and when it began to drizzle 
allowed her to share his raincoat, protecting her from the 
cold and the damp of the Norwegian summer. Their legs 
pressed together under the table, their heads leaned in 
towards each other ever so slightly, both hyper-aware of 
the electricity moving between them, but neither willing 
to believe the other was feeling the same.

The middle of the night came and went, and the 

leaders made their way back to the campsite cold, wet 

and just drunk enough on wine and laughter to make it 
impossible to go immediately to bed. Our star-crossed 
lovers sat together once more. He gathered every ounce 
of bravery and drunken abandon he could muster, and he 
gently took her hand under the table. Everything went 
still and silent in her mind, her focus lasered in on how 
his hand felt in hers. She couldn’t believe it, but it was 
real. One by one the others trickled off to bed, and the 
two were finally left alone.

On the morning of her last day in his country, they 

woke up in each other’s arms for the very first time, not 
quite able to believe what had transpired. He said, “Can 
this not be awkward today?” and she responded, “ … I 
sure hope so?” He laughed and clarified: “I mean, maybe 
this could happen again?”

And it did happen again. After an exhausting blur of 

a final day, filled with teasing, loaded eye contact, and 
constant blushing, they were able to escape once more. 

To be alone for a few more hours before their tearful 
farewell. And it was so tearful — they both cried and 
cried, and held each other so tightly before she walked 
away toward a car ready to whisk her away from her fairy 
tale, bound for the airport and her real life.

***

I’ll let you in on a little secret: I am the girl in the story. 

(Surprised? Me too.) This is what happened next in my 
personal little love saga: I went home, sad and expecting 
to have to somehow forget this boy, the first to intrigue 
me in a very long time, because how could anything ever 
come of our short-lived international summer romance?

But then an impossible message pinged onto my 

cracked iPhone screen: He didn’t want it to end, he 
wanted to come visit me. And I said yes.

After months of anticipation and the horrors of long-

distance and a six-hour time difference, he was here. 
Fredrik, my Norwegian fairy-tale prince, here in Ann 
Arbor. Tailgating a Michigan football game decked out in 
maize and blue, sitting across from me at Zingerman’s, 
cooking breakfast for me in my kitchen. It was perfect, 

it was a dream. Too perfect, in fact, because how is it 

fair that someone who makes me so wonderfully, 

blissfully, happy can also be so impossible, so 

unattainable? He lives 3,714 miles away, I’ve 

looked it up. How could anything ever come 

of this? Is it stupid to keep investing my time 
and energy, to keep trying?

I don’t have good answers for these 

questions. And I’ve obviously realized 
that this is not a perfect fairy tale story, 
because those don’t exist in real life (at 
least not mine). But I’m travelling to 
Norway again this Christmas. Fredrik and 
I have a Skype date every week, the most 
recent lasting five perfect hours. Maybe I 
am crazy, but the way I see it, relationships 
at this stage in life tend to be hard and 
hit barriers no matter what. Perhaps less 
dramatic, concrete barriers than the Atlantic 
Ocean, but college students struggle to find 
what they need in a relationship, graduates 
move to different parts of the country (or, 
ahem, world), people find that they grow 
in different directions, young professionals 
find that they have different goals for their 
lives than they once imagined.

The way I see it, any relationship at 

this juncture, or maybe ever, is going to 

be fraught with difficult decisions and uncertainty. 
The future simply is uncertain for me right now. I am 
careening toward graduation with very few ideas of 
where I will be next, a prospect that is both intoxicatingly 
exciting and completely terrifying. Nothing is out of the 
realm of possibilities, so I won’t discount any possible 
future, no matter how unexpected or unrealistic it may 
seem at face value. It’s the same with my crazy, odds-
defying and frustrating long-distance relationship: I have 
no idea where it’s going to go, if anywhere, but why reject 
it as impossible when the world is only just opening up 
its possibilities to me? Why end a story before it’s even 
begun? My life is not a perfect fairy tale, it’s much more 
exciting — anything could happen.

Star-Crossed Lovers

T

he palms of my hands inch forward, slow and 
steady, farther and farther away from my body. My 
eyes close, surrounded by darkness, with disso-

nant sounds that clatter and ring like hovering shards of 
fragmented glass occasionally colliding, I feel my hands 
quiver in space, this dimensionless zero-gravity place. I 
wait in this darkness, for some sort of cue, a sign, a voice 
that’ll tell me exactly what to do and what to feel.

Maybe a minute or so of this, and the space just beyond 

my hands that are stretched before me feel different — it’s 
charged with energy, some kinesphere crashing toward 
me, molecules vibrating as they bounce off the ridges in 
my skin. They feel warm.

And then I feel a touch. It starts on my pinky, the slight-

est, lightest brush, hardly palpable. It timidly presses 
into the outskirts of my palms, and then slowly shifts to 
the rest of my hand. The thumb is last. I feel a sense of 
warmth and humility, a sort of security in a place of loss. 
When his hands retract, I am left alone in the dark again.

Touch — it sounds sensual, weirdly sexy and uncom-

fortable at the same time, but what exactly is it? And 
do we have any idea how powerful “touch” is? I know I 
didn’t, and still don’t.

Last Wednesday, I participated in an event hosted by 

the Medical Arts program in the University of Michigan’s 
Medical School and hospital. It was a physician-dancer 
collaborative event, a first of its kind. My professor in the 
dance department invited me to demonstrate and perform 
at the function, surrounded by current medical practitio-
ners and physicians in training.

When I say I am a double major in dance and neurosci-

ence, 50 percent of reactions are a form of congratulatory 
amusement, and the remaining are a combination of con-
fusion, doubt and impossibility.

“Well that don’t make no sense, does it?” my Uber driv-

er scoffs. After the twinge of animosity fades, I usually 
force a laugh and say something like, “Well, there’s more 
overlap than you think,” and change the subject.

The problem is more widespread and disheartening 

than I had originally thought.

The arts and sciences are segregated in their own 

worlds, the practitioners siloed into their study they often 
forget the other’s presence, or publicly categorized as 
entities with no possibility for exchange and integration. 
The option for crossing over hardly even exists.

We are in a world where we are overstimulated by our 

senses and completely saturated with information that is 
handed to us in school and often spewed at us by society. 
To understand a person is to understand the world they 
inhabit, and the world they wish to be a part of. Trying to 
understand a person without their world, the context and 
background, seems to neglect the spokes of their wheel 
and the network that gives rise to the machine of miscel-
laneous nuts and bolts that makes up who she is.

On Tuesday, I stood in a room full of medical practitio-

ners. We did some collaborative movement exercises to 
tune in our senses and see the room from a new angle, a 
wider aperture, to understand a person from a non-tradi-
tional perspective.

We played with space — how do we enter a room, exit 

a room, move within a confined place? These are simple 
ideas that seem tedious and maybe not worth exploring, 
but confronting a patient is as much of an improvisation 
game as dance.

No, there is no music or spot-

light, chandeliers or dramatic fog, but 
there is an audience and a performer.

I remember waking up from my 

ACL reconstruction surgery in the post-
op room of the hospital. I can still feel the 
light hand that woke me up from my anesthetic 
daze. Despite the drugs that were circulating 
in my veins, I remember the flush of panic that 
nearly made me puke on the bedside table — did 
the surgery go well? What if it didn’t, what if I 
can’t walk anymore, what if they had to amputate 
my leg? I couldn’t begin to fathom the horror and 
grief.

I remember watching intensely, scrutinizing 

eyes following the doctor as he lifted his hand 
from my shoulder and walked around the table, 
noticing the distance between him and the bed 
rails, his posture and gait, the subtle nod that ges-
tures the nurse to walk this way, the tightness of 
his jaw, and the loose fists at his sides that brush the 
pockets of his white coat. He lifts up the sheets and I 
shut my eyes, because all I feel is fear.

My legs are still numb, my body is foreign and I 

am occupying a temporary container with my sloshy 
thoughts and medicated blood. It doesn’t matter that I’m 
sitting in a bed with carefully calculated and concentrat-
ed fluid bags hanging at my sides, or that the crash cart is 
around the corner, and defibrillators are ready to percuss, 
or that the abundance of surgeons here guarantees me 
life, even if I fall unconscious this instant.

I feel his hand on my foot.
It’s gentle and humble, the way my grandpa used to pat 

my knobby knees. When I slowly blink my eyes open, his 
eyes are at my level, I wonder if he’s squatting at the foot 
of the bed, and then realize he is sitting on a short stool to 
match my eye level. There’s a smiley face Sharpied on the 
big toe of my left foot, a little crooked so it looks smirky, 
and the doctor reassures me the operation was successful. 
I nod and muscle a smile on my heavy cheeks and let the 
darkness take me away again into the expansiveness of it 
all. His movements speak as loud, if not louder than the 
words of comfort that escape his mouth.

Maybe I am just a keen observer because of 18 years 

of analyzing body positions and their associated mean-
ings. But just like every novel and poem has an intended 
audience, why wouldn’t every physician? It’s not that 
the motions and gestures of pre- and post-operative care 
need to be choreographed or calculated to perfection — 
but that they can carry an enhanced consciousness and 
body awareness.

As patient-centered care becomes a central focus of the 

medical school curriculum and professionals are trained 
to be cognizant and empathetic in more complex ways, 
there is a necessity for spatial, tactile and body mindful-

ness that is both 

artful and rigorous.

When I stood across 

from a current med student 

and we played this simple hand 

game for heightened sensitivity, 

I was moved by the dedication and 

curiosity he rendered.
I could feel my silos overlapping like 

two waves crashing into each other, 
standing at the confluence where these 
two rivers cross. I was stunned by the 
possibility that maybe, just maybe, 18 
years of cultivating creativity gave me 
something to offer to him.

Maybe I could show him my safe 

space, the dance studio — even if it is the 
outpatient ward of a hospital — a play-
ground for adults, where every day, we 
create new movement, explore the inner 
workings of our bodies, and learn to use 
spontaneity as our shovel and pail. And 
this, the possibility of influencing patient 
care with a different type of conscientious-
ness, is the answer I want to give the Uber 
driver, the reason for my seemingly anti-
thetical pursuits.

But also, beyond the exercises and dia-

logues of how this specific form of art and science inter-
twine, I believe there is a fundamental understanding 
of empathy and lack of judgement that comes with the 
practice of music, dance, theatre, visual art and even lit-
erature.

There is immense bravery in delving into your imagi-

nation and then presenting it for display. There is dedi-
cation in the time and years of repetition that it takes to 
foster creativity and curiosity. Like flexibility, these are 
things that need to be practiced and reinforced to be as 
malleable and infinite as they were when we were young. 
There is fear in speaking your ideas and exposing yourself 
to vulnerability and criticism, and then incredible humil-
ity in learning to accept the arrows and fingers that are 
pointed directly your way.

These are not to discount the decades of training and 

learning that go into the life of a physician. There is a 
part of me that is more afraid of the things that lie ahead 
of this crossroad, the challenges and battles I do not yet 
even know exist. But needless to say, there are inherent 
values in the arts and sciences that are worth taking the 
time to share and explore.

And maybe this is the next step we take, as aspiring 

health care professionals, entrepreneurs and collabora-
tors, artists and learners, to better understand the people 
around us and our individual purpose in this changing 
world. Maybe this is how we get a little closer to under-
standing our existence and the short time we have to 
make a difference.

On November 14, members of the University of Michigan Muslim Students’ Association 
gathered for Ishaa prayer (the fifth and final Islamic prayer of the day) on the Diag. Hundreds 
of other students joined in solidarity, showing their support by forming a protective a circle 
around the MSA members. The event was organized in response to a series of anti-Muslim 
incidents during the week.
