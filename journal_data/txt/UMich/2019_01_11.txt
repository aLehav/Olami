The last few winters have 

not been favorable for deer 
in Ann Arbor. Since City 
Council approved a deer 
management 
program 
in 

2015 to reduce the size of the 
local population, 274 have 
been killed and 78 surgically 
sterilized. The city’s fourth 
deer cull began Jan. 2, 
closing parks across Ann 
Arbor with the aim of killing 
up to 150 deer by the end of 
the month.

Sharpshooters 
from 

White 
Buffalo 
Inc., 
the 

Connecticut-based company 
that has carried out the 
program for the last two 
years, will hunt deer on 
public and private property, 
including land owned by 
the University of Michigan, 
through Jan. 27.

Christopher 
Dick, 
a 

professor of ecology and 

evolutionary biology at the 
University 
of 
Michigan, 

said the cull is necessary to 
keep the deer population in 
check and protect the local 
ecosystem.

“They basically eat away 

at the forest understory, 
so there’s no regeneration 
of the forest,” Dick said. 
“What happens when you 
have these deer take off is 
this destruction of their own 
habitat if there’s no kind 
of predation. If you want 
Ann Arbor to have healthy 
parks and vibrant forests 
that take up carbon and help 
mitigate climate change, if 
you want a safe environment 
for kids to grow up and not 
be worried about ticks and 
diseases 
associated 
with 

overabundance of deer, then 
we really have to think about 
managing this urban deer 
population.”

About 50 students and faculty

STEM fields, as well as statistics 
about

“Each of your professors are 

experts and there’s no question 
about that, trust me … so treat 
them accordingly and try to take 
them as experts in their fields 
first,” Powell said. “On the flip 
side, I think you need to hold 
us as faculty at a similarly high 
professional standard.”

with no clear end in sight. In 
the meantime, approximately 
800,000 federal workers have 

been furloughed or are working 
without pay.

a million dollars over the 
last several years. Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 
was 

the sole vote against the 
cull when it was originally 
passed in 2015. He said while 
he remains opposed to the 
killing, he does not dispute 
the ecological impact of deer 
overabundance.

“I recognize that there 

are costs that are associated 
with a deer population in an 
urban area like Ann Arbor,” 
Taylor said. “At the same 
time, however, I believe that 
the costs associated with the 
cull exceed the benefits. The 
costs are of course financial, 
substantial, but I also believe 
them to be values-driven. The 
notion of shooting animals 
in Ann Arbor’s parks and 
natural areas degrades parks 
and natural areas. It degrades 
many residents’ sense of home 
and I believe is inconsistent 
with our community values.”

This is the final round of 

the program adopted four 
years ago in response to 
complaints from residents, 
who said there were too 
many of the animals present 
in the area, resulting in car 
accidents 
and 
damage 
to 

landscaping. Between 2004 
and 2015, the number of deer-
car collisions in Ann Arbor 
nearly tripled, going from 31 
to 88.

Dick was previously the 

director of the Edwin S. 
George Reserve, a wildlife 
preserve 
in 
Livingston 

County run by the University. 
He said he observed how the 
forests there benefited from 
regular deer culls dating back 
to the 1940s.

“If you look at the George 

Reserve, if you look at the 
understory 
and 
just 
take 

a walk through the forest, 
you can see all kinds of 
regeneration, like up to your 
waist, of oaks and hickories 
and 
other 
seedlings 
or 

hardwood and you just don’t 
see that here in the Ann Arbor 
parks,” Dick said. “There 
can 
be 
some 
occasional 

regeneration, 
saplings 
and 

things, but for the most part, 
in many places in the city, it’s 
just been way over browsed. 
The forests just aren’t coming 
back.”

City 
Communications 

Director Lisa Wondrash said 
Ann Arbor was concerned 
primarily 
with 
how 
the 

deer management program 
helped to protect the local 
ecosystem.

“Part of the problem is the 

impact of deer browsing and 
the impact to our natural 
areas, so we’re talking about 
the sustainability of plants 
and animals and insects in our 
natural areas and whether or 
not the decrease in the deer 
population has contributed to 
that, that’s how we assess the 
program itself and whether or 
not we have to continue deer 
culling,” Wondrash said.

Ann Arbor is not alone in 

its efforts to keep its deer 
population in check. To cope 
with growing deer numbers, 
other cities have turned to 
lethal methods. Mt. Lebanon, 
Pa., also contracted with 
White Buffalo to pick off 
deer using a combination 
of 
archers 
and 
gunmen. 

Cincinnati residents credit 
sharpshooters from the police 
department 
and 
volunteer 

bow hunters with helping to 
“sharply reduce” the number 
of deer in local parks.

In 
Ann 
Arbor, 
the 

program was met with legal 
challenges from the outset. 
When the first cull was set 
to begin in 2016, a group of 
residents sued, saying the 
sharpshooters 
would 
turn 

city into “killing fields” and 
diminish 
their 
quality 
of 

life. A federal judge allowed 
the city to proceed with the 
program, and the case was 

eventually dismissed. A 
second lawsuit contested 
the validity of the cull 
permit 
issued 
by 
the 

Michigan Department of 
Natural Resources. It, too, 
was thrown out.

The Humane Society 

of 
Huron 
Valley 
has 

been a vocal opponent 
of the cull. In an email 
interview with The Daily, 
Tanya Hilgendorf, CEO 
and president of HSHV, 
disputed the claim that 
there are too many deer in 
Ann Arbor.

“Ann 
Arbor’s 
deer 

cull is not just a waste 
of taxpayer money; it is 
a waste of energy and 
time,” Hilgendorf wrote 
in an email to The Daily. 
“There 
was 
never 
an 

overpopulation, 
and 

there was never a public 
health or safety threat 
necessitating 
closing 

down a dozen or more 
neighborhood 
public 

parks, 
next 
to 
homes, 

schools and bus stops, in 
order to put sharpshooters 

in them.”

Estimates 
of 
the 
size 

of 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
deevvr 

population 
vary 
due 
to 

methodological 
difficulties 

in getting an accurate count. 
A 2017 count indicated a 
50 percent increase in the 
number of deer spotted from 
the previous year, but White 
Buffalo admitted in March 
2018 
it 
had 
significantly 

overestimated the size of 
the 
local 
population. 
In 

that report, White Buffalo 
suggested the deer population 
had grown in certain areas 
while decreasing in others.

Bernie Banet, a member 

of 
Washtenaw 
Citizens 

for 
Ecological 
Balance, 
a 

group 
that 
supports 
the 

management program, said 
it was essential for the city 
to combat what he called an 
overabundance of deer.

“Too many of them are 

really destructive in many 
ways to the vegetation, and 
they threaten people, too,” 
Banet said. “A few are nice to 
have around, but it can quickly 
get to be too much of a good 
thing. We have some people 
who are very concerned about 
killing deer and feel very 
protective toward them — 
they feel toward the deer the 
way they would toward their 
own pet dogs and cats. That’s 
understandable, but it’s not 
helpful.”

Since 
the 
cull 
kicked 

off 
earlier 
this 
month, 

protestors 
from 
Friends 

of Ann Arbor Wildlife in 
Nature have demonstrated 
near sharpshooter perches 
around 
the 
city, 
holding 

signs and demanding an end 
to what they see as the city’s 
unethical 
and 
inefficient 

attempts to reduce the size of 
the deer population.

City Councilmember Jane 

Lumm, I-Ward 2, introduced 
a 
resolution 
Jan. 
7 
that 

would have directed the city 
attorney’s office to investigate 
the protesters’ actions. Lumm 
said the demonstrators were 
purposefully interfering with 
White Buffalo’s ability to 
effectively hunt deer.

“They 
have 
actually 

stopped and prohibited our 
contractor 
White 
Buffalo 

from 
performing 
their 

culling contracted work on 
properties that have been 
identified for culling,” Lumm

SMTD Sophomore Sammy Sussman on his story “Former students bring 
40 years of miscondcut allegations by SMTD professor”:

“Initially I was a little freaked out because it was my first time writing a story for News...but 
as the school started taking i tmore seriously I felt much better about it. My initial reaction 
was one of fear because as a student in the school, it’s a very strange experience to be 
doing something that significantly harms the SMTD brand, like I know the school reached 
out to us because they were very concerned on how it would affect their investigations and 
kind of the whole image the music cultivaltes. But in terms of how seriously the school took 
it and how significant the action they took was, I was very proud and impressed by that.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
This is important that Middle Eastern and North 

African individuals, be it staff, faculty or students, all have 
theopportunity to more accurately identify their own identity. 
But it’s not the standard way of doing it. It means that it’s a 
little bit more complicated, and right now it’s still embedded 
within the white racial category, and we know that there’s a 
lot of complications that come with that.”

Ethriam Brammer, assistant dean and DEI implementation lead of Rackham Graduate School 


Communications 
Director 

of the Research Office, cited 
these statistics, noting how 
helpful the federal funding has 
been to the University. 

“We’re 
the 
number 
one 

public 
research 
university 

in the country in terms of 
research expenditures, at 1.55 
billion dollars a year,” Piazza 
said. “About 55% of that stems 
from the federal government, 
so 
the 
partnerships 
we’ve 

created 
with 
the 
federal 

government have really been 
great over the years for us.” 

Associate Vice President of 

Research in Social Sciences and 
Humanities Stephanie Rowley 
highlighted the importance 
of federal funding as well, 
bringing attention especially 
to research in the humanities. 
Rowley wrote in an email how 
essential National Endowment 
of Humanities’ support is for 
humanities faculty members. 

“I’d like to emphasize the 

potential for faculty in the 
humanities 
to 
be 
affected 

given the shutdown of the 
NEH,” Rowley wrote. “Our 
humanities 
faculty 
rely 

on 
NEH 
for 
fellowships 

that 
support 
humanities 

scholarship. 
Support 
from 

the federal government helps 
our researchers here at the 
University of Michigan spur 
advancements in a variety of 
areas ranging from the arts 
and humanities to medicine 
and mobility.”

Vice President of Research 

Jack Hu said the largest source 
of 
federal 
funding 
comes 

from the National Institutes 
of Health, which is operating 
normally during the shutdown. 
According to Hu, the current 
situation is not dire, as ongoing 
research 
projects 
are 
not 

being immediately affected. 
However, 
because 
of 
the 

shutdown, researchers cannot 
send in project proposals, and 
proposals submitted earlier 
are not being reviewed, he 
said. 

“From the 22nd until earlier 

last week, many faculty and 
students were not here so the 
impact 
of 
the 
government 

shutdown on research was 
not very significant,” Hu said. 
However, due to the shutdown, 
we could not submit proposals 
to the NSF and those agencies 
that are impacted by the 
government shutdown. Also, 
proposals that went in earlier 
are not being reviewed.”

This, 
Hu 
said, 
could 

have long-term effects that 
might halt future research, 
leaving research faculty in 
uncertainty. 

The 
delay 
of 
proposals, 

proposal review may have 
a longer term impact,” Hu 
said. “As the shutdown drags 
on, then there will be gaps 
for 
research 
faculty 
who 

are 
expecting 
support 
or 

anticipating 
support 
from 

those agencies, and they will 
not know until the government 
reopens and proposal reviews 
restart.”

Bradford 
Orr, 
Associate 

Vice President of Research 
in 
Natural 
Sciences 
and 

Engineering, 
echoed 
Hu’s 

comments. He said as of yet, 

no researcher has approached 
him 
with 
serious 
funding 

problems, 
but 
rather 
with 

grant deadline or review panel 
issues. 

“There 
have 
been 

researchers that have come 
and said to me that they have 
been impacted in the sense that 
there was a review panel that 
was supposed to take place but 
now it’s not going to take place, 
or that a deadline for a grant is 
likely to be changed, or is likely 
to be postponed,” Orr said. 
“There’s no one that’s come to 
me and said I haven’t received 
my money and therefore am 
not able to pay for this and this 
bill. We’re not at that spot yet.”

Orr noted this pause in 

research proposal acceptance 
and review panels will delay 
the start times of research 
projects. Mostly, Orr said, this 
will cause inconvenience, but 
if the shutdown continues, 
there could be more serious 
issues. 

“What’s going to happen 

for sure is that the start time 
and review time of proposals 
is going to be drawn out,” Orr 
said. “That will happen, it’s 
happening now. And that can 
be dealt with, it’s inconvenient. 
But where it becomes serious is 
where payments to grants that 
already exist aren’t made and 
therefore bills such as salaries 
couldn’t be paid.”

LSA junior Yara El-Tawil 

works at the Rogel Cancer 
Center on the University’s 
medical campus. El-Tawil said 
while her research project 
is not being affected by the 
shutdown, she is concerned 
by what she’s heard about the 
shutdown affecting research 
grants. 

“I 
don’t 
like 
that 
the 

government is holding funding 
hostage from people who need 
it, especially because right 
now climate change and all 
the research that’s being done 
right now is really important,” 
El-Tawil said. “For people 
whose job it is to do research 
or any type of work that is 
funded by the government 
agency, it’s completely unfair 
for them since the government 
doesn’t want to keep moving.” 

Hu said he was confident 

in the University’s ability to 
fund research in the short-
term, but if the shutdown 
carries on, there will be bigger 
consequences. 

“Overall, I think Michigan’s 

financial position is strong,” 
Hu said. “Our research funding 
is strong. So in the short term, 
we managed well. But if the 
shutdown continues, drags on, 
then we will be impacted much 
more.” 

advice 
about 
the 
interviewing 

process for jobs. He focused on 
how interviewers may ask personal 
questions at times, and those 
questions can sometimes negatively 
affect the interviewees and have 
unintended consequences. Thus, 
when students get interviewed, they 
have the right to politely decline to 
answer overly personal questions.

Powell also discussed the negative 

impact personal schemas can have 
in the job application process and 
how professors like himself are 
hoping to address these issues at the 
University.

“Schemas and lack of critical mass 

can lead to people, on one hand, not 
evaluating candidates fairly, and on 
another hand, can set the candidates 
in situations where they can’t show 
off their full chops because they’re 
not comfortable with the situation. 
… This can lead to a lower success 
rate,” Powell said. “So we are trying 
to work to get around and give these 
talks so people understand.”

Engineering 
senior 
Janera 

Martinez said she was pleased 
with the University’s focus on its 
challenges with diversity.

“I think what really surprised me 

was to know that at such a high level 
of the University, they really care 
about the diversity issue, especially 
in a field that it is not represented as 
much with minorities and women,” 
Martinez said. “So that was really 
eye-opening for me because I 
thought, not that the University 
was ignoring it, but more just 
wasn’t really aware, so to hear that 
aerospace was involved with that 
was really encouraging for me.”

The lecture first focused on how 

everyone has implicit biases and 
how those biases can impact their 
actions in regards to interviewing 
and hiring people for jobs. For 
instance, according to Powell, white 
applicants receive 50 percent more 
callbacks for interviews than Black 
applicants.

Engineering 
senior 
Judson 

commented on how he’s noticed 
the presence of these biases in his 
various organizations and sectors on 
campus.

“Like the professor said, this 

department is very male-dominated 

and you see that in the kids who get 
elected in certain job interviews and 
leadership positions on teams I’ve 
been a part of, but it seems like it’s 
getting better, which is promising,” 
Judson said.

When discussing what she learned 

about the job application process 
from the lecture, Martinez said she 
realized the value of learning about 
how to approach personal questions 
during interviews.

“I think a big thing that I 

hadn’t thought about before was 
the answering of those personal 
questions,” Martinez said. “I never 
really thought about the fact that 
I really had a right to be like, ‘Oh I 
don’t want to answer that question,’ 
or that it was a formal disadvantage 
that someone may go through.”

Engineering graduate student 

Shashank Kedia said the lecture was 
important for international students 
like him, but also students in general, 
in regards to being more mindful of 
others and their preferences.

“Personally, I am also someone 

not from the U.S.,” Kedia said.

students. 
LSA 
junior 

Sumrah Jilani was surprised 
to learn the University offered 
degrees students could complete 
partially online.

“It is surprising to find that 

out, mostly for the fact that it’s 
specifically online,” Jilani said. 
“I think it would make sense 
if just the general coursework 
was considered to be at a higher 
standard, but to be honest, I didn’t 
even know U of M had an online 
program.”

Each of the eligible schools 

were scored out of a total 200 
points and rankings were based 
on freshman retention rate and 
graduation rate. The University 
topped the ranking list with a 
freshman retention rate of 97 

percent and a graduation rate of 92 
percent, beating out number two 
University of California, Berkeley, 
who had the same freshman 
retention rate but a graduation 
rate of 91 percent. It was noted by 
the individuals in charge of the 
ranking that no school evaluated 
was offered any sort of special 
treatment and the data collection 
process would allow anyone who 
conducted the study to come to 
the same conclusion.

Nishitha Malugari, an LSA and 

Business junior, is also pursuing 
the pre-med path at the University 
and explained why she continued 
on with the pre-med program 
after her freshman year.

“I’ve known from high school 

that I wanted to pursue medicine, 
and even though the classes I took 
freshman year were difficult, I 
still greatly enjoyed what I was 
learning,” Malugari wrote in an 
email interview with The Daily. 

“I also had great experiences 
working in my research lab and 
volunteering 
in 
the 
hospital. 

I knew I could see myself as a 
physician one day and knew that 
the pre-med route is right for me.”

Steven 
Clark, 
director 
of 

the U-M Program in Biology, 
also spoke about the first-year 
retention rate and how the biology 
program in particular encourages 
students to carry through the 
major by offering many resources.

“Our 
introductory 
courses 

have a lot of opportunities for 
students to get help,” Clark said. 
“We’ve developed active learning 
modules, we’ve got undergraduate 
teaching assistants, we’re working 
with the Science Learning Center 
so there is drop in tutoring and 
study groups for the students. 
We have a lot of material that 
gets them familiar with good 
study habits and to put in the 
kind of time to help them do well 

and that’s kind of what keeps the 
students in the major.”

Jilani reflected on her own 

experience with the pre-med track 
at the University. Though she has 
not taken any online courses, she 
explained while courses can be 
demanding, some of them have 
helped her to learn a lot and bring 
her closer to her goal of becoming 
a physician.

“So far my experiences have 

mostly been good,” Jilani said. “I 
won’t lie; most pre-med classes are 
definitely a lot of work, and can be 
extremely challenging. However, 
one of my favorite classes I’ve 
taken is organic chemistry. ... I 
think having a genuine interest 
in the subject material definitely 
helped me do a lot better, but the 
big factors were just making sure I 
dedicated a lot of time to studying 
and I would work a lot with other 
people in the class to study and 
solidify the material together.”

Rackham then approached 

the 
Business 
School 
to 

develop a business-oriented 
bridge program in 2016 after 
continual 
and 
successful 

bridge programs had been 
formed for other departments.

All of the bridge programs 

aim 
to support a diverse 

student 
body 
in 
doctoral 

education, 
and 
Graduate 

Coordinator Ashley Stauffer 
discussed how they are aiming 
for the same goals in the 
Business School program.

“The main mission of the 

program is to expand the pool 
of Ross PhD applicants who 
bring 
diverse 
experiences 

and ways of thinking about 
research, and who come from 
diverse educational, cultural, 
geographic, 
and 
familial 

backgrounds,” Stauffer said 

in an email to The Daily. 
“Another goal of the program 
is to provide additional paths 
to the PhD program at Ross 
for students who have strong 
potential for the degree, but 
would benefit from additional 
academic 
and 
professional 

preparation.”

As 
the 
program 
grows, 

Brian Jones, director of Ph.D. 
and research administration at 
the University, said in an email 
to The Daily they plan to keep 
the student pool small with 
only three students in order to 
sustain an individualized plan 
for each participant.

“This is an important new 

program for us, but the intent 
is to keep the program small, 
admitting up to three students 
each year, so that we can focus 
our time and resources to make 
sure all students succeed,” 
Jones 
said. 
“Working 
to 

provide research experience 
and appropriate quantitative 
skills to fully prepare bridge 
participants for PhD studies, 
we hope that graduates of the 

program will then choose to 
pursue a PhD, and even apply 
and matriculate into the Ross 
PhD program.”

Ayala champions the bridge 

program’s mission and said 
he feels very supported by the 
program and the experience 
he’s gotten so far.

“The doctoral students and 

candidates in the department 
have been very gracious and 
share valuable insights from 
their recent experiences in the 
program … Exposure to the 
academic research process and 
the doctoral experience will 
be highly beneficial for Bridge 
participants who choose to 

pursue careers in academia,” 
Ayala wrote in an email to The 
Daily.

Many of the bridge programs 

have had immense success, 
with a high percentage of 
participants 
enrolling 
in 

doctoral programs, according 
to 
Rackham. 
Jones 
added 

he has high hopes for the 
program, and stresses the 
advantage of sustaining it.

“Our desire is to grow 

the number and diversity of 
backgrounds of prospective 
students for our, and perhaps 
other top business schools’ 
PhD programs, by providing 
an 
additional 
pathway 

for 
students 
to 
prepare 

themselves for the rigors of a 
PhD program,” Jones wrote. 
“We hope that students who 
complete the program will 
join and excel in the Ross 
PhD program, and add to our 
success in placing graduates in 
tenure track faculty positions 
at top tier business schools.”

said. “They were yelling, they 
were using lights and other 
things to interfere with this 
work.”

Councilmember 
Jeff 

Hayner, D-Ward 1, opposed 
the measure. He said that 
because most of the program 
takes place in Wards 1 and 
2, he had heard a lot about it 
from his constituents.

“I don’t feel that with 

a good conscience I can 
empower or encourage the 
city to engage with residents 
in 
a 
way 
that 
somehow 

interferes with their right to 
protest,” Hayner said, adding, 
“I’m not gonna sic the city on 
these residents.”

The measure was voted 

down 6-5. Wendy Welch, 
director of communications 
for the Humane Society of 
Huron Valley, said it was 
fortunate 
the 
resolution 

failed.

“Had it been passed, it 

would have made protesting 
the cull illegal,” Welch said. 
“And whether someone is 
pro- or anti-cull, what an 
appalling assault on folks’ 
Constitutional right to free 
speech.”

Wondrash 
would 
not 

comment on how the protests 
affected the ongoing deer 
cull.

“The cull just began on 

Jan. 2, so it’s still underway 
and we’re not going to be 
talking about any logistical 
details related to the cull,” 
Wondrash said. “If there is 
any impact, that would be 
included in White Buffalo’s 
final report to City Council 
after the deer program is over 
and when the assessment is 
done.”

Hilgendorf said the city 

would be better off directing 
its resources to other issues, 
like 
crosswalk 
safety 
or 

affordable housing.

“There are so many more 

important issues that need the 

city’s attention,” Hilgendorf 
said. “Even if the ongoing cull 
costs do not make you flinch, 
when you have men with 
guns in parks all over the city 
and on campus it’s going to 
cause a lot of controversy and 
demand a lot attention. There 
is no room for error.”

The city also relies on 

nonlethal 
methods 
of 

population 
control. 
In 

November, 
White 
Buffalo 

neutered six female deer in 
Wards 1 and 2, removing their 
ovaries and releasing them 
back into the wild with ear 
tags. A total of 78 deer have 
been sterilized to date.

Taylor said he thought 

sterilization could function 
as a compromise between 
critics and supporters of the 
deer management program.

“I think sterilization is 

really the only method that 
reduces deer population and 
does not result in the violent 
death of deer,” Taylor said.

F

or a state known as the 
“Great 
Lakes 
State,” 

the 
current 
state 
of 

water in Michigan is terribly 
concerning.

Growing 
up 
in 
Grand 

Rapids, some of my favorite 
memories are from when my 
family and I would pack up 
chairs, snacks, books and toys. 
We would drive west until we 
reached towns like Holland or 
Grand Haven and spend the 
whole day on the white sands 
of Lake Michigan. This was 
probably the setting where my 
interest in the environment 
was planted inside me. It is 
an emotional sentiment that 
has grown over the years and 
I always feel happy thinking 
about looking out onto the 
expanse of blue waves along 
the shore.

The 
Great 
Lakes 
— 

consisting of Lakes Michigan, 
Huron, 
Superior, 
Ontario 

and Erie — are the largest 
bodies of water in the entire 
world, making up one fifth 
of the Earth’s total surface 
freshwater supply. The lakes 
were formed more than 10,000 
years 
ago 
from 
enormous 

glaciers that melted and molded 
the landscape into the familiar 
mitten shape we all know and 
love. Their size and beauty 
have earned them nicknames 
like “the nation’s fourth coast” 
or “the fresh coast, best coast.” 
Our entire tourism campaign 
is based on these images — 
we’ve all heard the calming 
voice of Tim Allen on the radio 
give a picturesque description 
of our landscape followed by 
the soothing tagline: “Pure 
Michigan.” Pristine water is 
woven into the very fabric of 
Michigan’s identity.

However, a quick Google 

search about Michigan water 
would have any reader believe 
the 
Great 
Lakes 
State 
is 

anything but pure. The Flint 
water crisis, Asian carp and 
other invasive species, the Line 
5 oil pipeline debate, the Nestle 
bottling plant controversy, or 
the recent frenzy about the 
PFAS contamination statewide 

are but a few examples of 
how 
environmental 
issues 

surrounding our water over 
the past decade have been 
less than ideal, and frankly, 
disheartening.

We need to start taking the 

cultural weight of water into 
consideration 
when 
having 

these debates in order to save 
what has become our most 
historically significant icon.

Now, these crises are mostly 

independent of one another 
and would be tragic no matter 
where they occur (Minnesota 
is 
running 
into 
their 
own 

pipeline issues with Line 3, 
and PFAS contaminations are 
a developing story nationwide). 
However, there is something 
uniquely troubling about the 
bombardment 
of 
bad 
news 

in association with the state 
of Michigan water. How can 
Michigan be the Great Lakes 
State if we cannot get a handle 
on our own water?

Take 
the 
recent 
debate 

about the Enbridge Line 5 oil 
pipeline, for example. For those 
unfamiliar 
with 
the 
story, 

the abridged version is about 
how an old pipeline, Line 5, 
carries large amounts of oil 
underneath 
the 
Mackinac 

Bridge, through the Upper 
Peninsula, and then the Straits 
of Mackinac to Canada, putting 
the 
Great 
Lakes, 
and 
our 

economy, at major risk if there 
is a spill. This topic was on the 
front lines of the 2018 Michigan 
gubernatorial 
debate, 
with 

newly-elected Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer 
vowing 
to 
take 

measures to shut down Line 
5 on her first day in office. It 

should be noted that as of Jan. 2 
Governor Whitmer announced 
on Twitter she is honoring 
this promise and has formally 
asked Attorney General Dana 
Nessel for legal options moving 
forward to shut down Line 5.

Proponents of the pipeline, 

such as Enbridge and former 
Gov. Rick Snyder, however, 
claim that actions such as this 
would be drastic, and have 
set up plans to build a tunnel 
around the pipeline to ease 
the risk of a potential spill. In 
the debate over the pipeline, 
figures and statistics are often 
thrown 
around 
about 
the 

economy, cleanup times and 
insurance plans, all of which 
are extremely important to 
consider.

But 
what 
if 
we 
took 

into 
account 
the 
cultural 

significance of a spill as well? 
Michigan’s blossoming tourism 
industry would be dealt a fatal 
blow and thousands would 
lose their jobs. Furthermore, 
it would say a great deal about 
us that we would leave such 
possibilities up to chance. I find 
it hard to imagine we could, in 
good faith, listen to another 
Pure Michigan ad and pretend 
the idealistic vision presented 
is anything close to reality. Is 
that something we are willing 
to accept as Michiganders?

2018 was one of the most 

divisive and contentious years 
in modern history. The left and 
the right seem to be slipping 
farther apart than ever before, 
and finding issues that can bring 
us together is more critical 
than ever in 2019. Water could 
be one of those issues. While 
there may be disagreements 
on how exactly to get there, 
a future with cleaner water 
is something everyone from 
this state should support. If 
we don’t start standing up for 
what is truly important to our 
collective identity now, we 
may no longer have anything 
worth championing in the 
future.

Not so open mic

CAROLINE LLANES | COLUMN

W

hen I heard about 

the 
leaked 
audio 

from Louis C.K.’s 

big comeback set (or second 

comeback, 
if 
showing 
up 

unannounced at New York’s 

Comedy Cellar is considered 

a comeback), I labeled it in my 

brain as one more thing not to 

interact with.

Comics like Louis C.K. are 

intentionally 
inflammatory, 

aiming 
to 
provoke 
with 

comments ranging from blatant 

transphobia 
and 
racism 
to 

digs at millennials and their 

obsession with “PC culture,” 

a term I did not realize meant 

“political correctness” rather 

than 
“personal 
computer” 

until embarrassingly recently. 

Not only is paying attention to 

comics and instigators giving 

them exactly what they want; 

it’s 
downright 
exhausting. 

Every day, the news cycle 

churns out some fresh hell, and 

you have to prioritize what’s 

going to get your emotional 

attention that day.

Louis C.K. did not even 

crack my top five list of News 

Items to be Upset About. Sadly, 

these things are unavoidable, 

as people post screenshots of 

transcripts and write think 

pieces and generally make it 

impossible not to interact with 

this god-awful set. So I found 

what I could of the bootlegged 

audio and listened to it. It 

was so…not funny. Even for 

comics who like to walk the 

line between what’s acceptable 

and what’s not — who claim 

to occupy an edgy space — it 

was just completely devoid of 

humor.

Judd 
Apatow 
called 
it 

“hacky, unfunny, shallow” and 

he’s right. Not only is it all of 

these things, it’s also tired. 

C.K. brings absolutely nothing 

fresh with transphobic and 

racist comments about Asian 

men, especially when there 

are so many Asian comics. 

Gay Asian men like Joel Kim 

Booster and Bowen Yang, as 

well as trans Asian women 

like Patti Harrison, are able to 

deliver comedy that is actually 

funny 
while 
addressing 

their 
identity 
cogently 
and 

genuinely, bringing empathy to 

their sets. C.K.’s return also got 

me thinking about how openly 

hostile comedy is to those who 

aren’t straight white men.

Gilda 
Radner 
was 
an 

iconic comedian, one of the 

original seven cast members on 

Saturday Night Live. So many 

comics today, male and female, 

cite her as an inspiration. 

Watching clips of her perform 

as wacky reporter Roseanne 

Roseannadanna on Weekend 

Update still makes me laugh. 

She absolutely steals whatever 

scene she is in and exudes 

a 
hilariously 
chaotic 
blend 

energy and charisma. Radner 

also famously struggled with 

an eating disorder. She says it 

best: “Because I’m not a perfect 

example of my gender, I decided 

to be funny about what I didn’t 

have, instead of worrying about 

it.”

So much of comedy depends 

on subversion of norms in order 

to get laughs, which leaves 

women in comedy with the 

quandary of either attempting 

to perform womanhood as 

they’re supposed to without 

making waves or eschewing 

the portrait of traditional 

womanhood, 
upsetting 

people along the way.

Radner 
faced 
enormous 

obstacles. 
During 
National 

Lampoon Radio Hour, male 

cast 
members 
and 
male 

writers 
would 
collaborate 

on sketches without the help 

or presence of the female 

cast 
members. 
Radner 

would then volunteer to be 

on the typewriter in order 

to 
transcribe 
the 
ideas, 

inserting her own ideas and 

bits 
whenever 
she 
could 

She was a trailblazer in the 

comedy world, a world where 

“Animal 
House” 
was 
the 

standard for how women were 

treated. John Belushi asked 

her to move to New York 

to be a part of the National 

Lampoon Radio Hour, saying 

that he wanted her to be “the 

girl” — as in, the only girl. 

This was all happening in the 

early days of SNL in the 1970s. 

Has anything changed? C.K.’s 

return suggests no, things 

have not changed.

During 
his 
set, 
Louis 

C.K. blamed the loss of $35 

million on the cancellation of 

his forthcoming TV special 

and movie. In addition, he 

lamented that he had been 

out of the comedy scene for 

so long (11 months). What is 

$35 million to Louis C.K., a 

man whose comedy career 

is long and illustrious, who 

has been a producer on many 

successful television shows 

and has had many a stand-up 

special on HBO?

What about the women 

who 
were 
subjected 
to 

C.K.’s behavior, having to 

endure humiliating displays 

of 
power, 
unnecessarily 

sexual situations and hostile 

work 
environments? 
These 

women’s careers have been 

sidelined 
and 
shattered 

because they dared to speak 

up. What did Gilda Radner 

and her co-stars Jane Curtin 

and Laraine Newman have to 

deal with during their time 

on SNL? What drove Gilda 

Radner to so closely control 

her diet because she felt it 

was the only thing she could 

control? 
Looking 
at 
these 

patterns, it becomes clear 

why women must struggle to 

be represented in a pool of 

comedians crowded by men. 

Women have to get a leg up 

in the world of comedy, while 

Louis C.K. gets a standing 

ovation 
after 
destroying 

multiple 
women’s 
careers. 

Is it worth $35 million? I’m 

certainly not the one who 

gets to make that call, but 

I’d take even five more female 

comedians 
over 
another 

angry, bitter, hacky white man 

lashing out because he can’t 

get away with his bad behavior 

anymore.

H

ome 
from 
college, 

I 
walked 
into 
my 

shared room to see my 

sister and her friends seated 
among a strewn lot of clothing 
on 
our 
shag-carpet-covered 

floor. They seemed to be in an 
incredibly 
heated 
argument 

about what to wear for their 
impending “photoshoot” and 
needed outfit advice.

“Ugh,” my sister let out with 

a sigh of familiar frustration. 
“None of these outfits will 
photograph well. I need a good 
picture for my Instagram.”

The 
obstacle 
my 
sister 

and her friends faced is not 
unfamiliar 
territory 
for 

millennials 
and 
younger 

generations, that have been 
exposed to social media in 
various forms since middle 
school or even earlier. The 
desire to appear a certain way 
on the social media platform of 
their choosing has evolved from 
a way to share one’s interests 
and whereabouts with others 
to a societal norm. An event 
can no longer occur without 
the 
importance 
of 
getting 

a 
“post-worthy” 
picture 
or 

sharing a video of whatever we 
are attending to prove we have 
been there or done that. What 
becomes of the self and self-
worth in this age of sharing one 
fine-tuned, filtered perspective 
of our lives with others?

Coming to college last fall, 

this pressure loomed over me. 
There was this inherent need 
to share with everyone back 
home what I was up to, and to 
indicate how much fun I was 
having in this new chapter of 
my life. Despite the pressures 
I was facing — struggling to 
figure out where I fit in at a 

school 30 times the size of my 

high school over halfway across 
the country, or to determine 
who my friends were — I could 
hide behind a manufactured 
Instagram post or Snapchat 
story. Social media allows for 
us to display this altered reality 
to fit a mold society has shaped 
for us. My persona online did 

not demonstrate the difficulties 
I faced in the classroom, the 
tears I shed over stressful 
nights or friendship issues. 
No, my social media upheld an 
expected façade of someone 
constantly happy, surrounded 
by friends, adventuring, and 
living only the best life a college 
student at a such a renowned 
university could.

This is not just a surface-

level, 
adolescent 
issue, 

but rather a deeply rooted 
problem with larger societal 
implications. 
Individuals 
of 

all 
ages, 
gender 
identities, 

nationalities, ethnicities and 
economic statuses are faced 
with this dual identity crisis. 
With the maturation of social 
media has come the implication 
we must dedicate time and 
energy to keep an image of 
ourselves that may be entirely 
inauthentic. So many of us are 
guilty of buying into this idea. 
We 
sacrifice 
our 
opinions, 

feelings and beliefs to show 
we are doing “the next coolest 
thing.” We smile regardless of 
what may be happening in the 
background. 
In 
maintaining 

this image, we lose a sense 
of who we are off-screen. 
We 
become 
caricatures 
of 

ourselves in the pictures we 
share with others. Ultimately, 
we sometimes forget to show 
we are not that person, even 
though it may seem that way to 
our hundreds of followers.

Yes, 
there 
is 
no 
issue 

in taking a picture for the 
memory, and there are some 
who use their media platforms 
for voicing their opinions or 

advocating for causes, but they 
are not the majority. Most of us 
— many of us subconsciously — 
find the need to demonstrate we 
are living an enviable version of 
our lives.

Would you ever post a 

picture of yourself without 
makeup or an aesthetically 
pleasing outfit? Or post a 
Snapchat 
story 
about 
how 

you actually are not happy 
or having a good time? At 
the risk of sounding bold or 
oversimplifying the issue, what 
would happen if we were to try 
and step away? Perhaps we 
would have a grand realization 
that the amount of energy and 
time allotted to social media is 
absurd, and that in this time 
wasted, we have missed out 
on the opportunities life has 
presented us. But realistically, 
we won’t do this.

I am not suggesting there 

is a blanket solution for this, 
or even that it is a problem for 
everyone. Rather, I am stating 
my personal goal to ease away 
from this version of myself 
and the tendency to give into 
the pressure to maintain an 
inauthentic persona for all 
of my “closest” friends on my 
Instagram or Facebook. Yes, 
there may be the chance I 
disappoint my lab partner 
from the seventh grade with 
my social media hiatus or 
realism, but I think at the 
root of it all, I will be able 
to get in touch with a truer 
version of myself. With that, 
I am pledging to spend more 
time 
in 
conversation, 
and 

not on my phone. More time 
dancing to the music, instead 
of filming from the corner of 
the party to post another one 
of those Snapchat stories. I 
pledge to live in the moment 
and continue to work on 
myself in the present, instead 
of worrying about how my life 
will appear in perfectly edited 
squares.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

“It’s not worth being a partial person or worth 
having an identity that’s incomplete.” — Sam 
Melo of Rainbow Kitten Surprise
Google will tell you identity is “the fact 
of being who or what a person or thing is.” 
Deceptively simple? You bet. Identity is one of 
the most complicated concepts we face every 
day, especially if we consider ourselves to hold 
a hybrid identity, a mix of contradictory and 
diverse facets. If you’re looking for the living 
embodiment of multi-dimensionality, turn to 
Sam Melo, lead singer of the band Rainbow 
Kitten Surprise. As a son of missionary parents, 
Melo spent seven years of his childhood in the 
Dominican Republic before moving back to the 
United States, ultimately attending Appalachian 
State University in N.C.. He grew up in a family 
who not only spread a Christian message in a 
foreign country, but preached strong Southern 
values. In his song “Hide,” released in Aug. 
of 2018, Melo details his emotions behind 
discovering that he was gay and subsequently 
feeling like he had to hide his sexuality.
“Hide” is a clear nod to the LGBTQ+ 
community, detailing the freedom that comes 
with being unapologetically yourself. But 
“Hide” doesn’t stop there — it pushes this 

unrestrained existence a step further. The 
magic of “Hide” resides in its ability to subvert 
how we approach the idea of identity and the 
communities that influence our existence. 
“Hide” provided affirmation when I needed it 
most, drastically altering how I view my own 
identity, and it did this for me in a three step 
process.

STEP #1: Conflict in Identity

Melo is masterful in his depiction of 
contradicting worlds. He makes a clear nod 
to the conflict between his sexuality and the 
religious community he grew up in with the 
lyrics, “The Son of Man held me in his clutches, 
the sons of men pulled me to the touch and I 
loved it.”
With these lines, Melo launched me into the 
intensity of his internal division — when the 
divine harshly conflicts with a dimension of 
who we inherently are. I could physically feel 
the sense of disapproval from the community 
he’d been bred in, held in the clutches of religion 
while drawn to the “sons of men.”
Although nowhere close to the difficulties 
Melo depicts of his sexuality conflicting with 
Southern values and religious upbringing, I 
instantaneously internalized “Hide,” feeling 
solace in its nod to my battle with the creative 
versus the practical, the most epic conflict 

of the 21st century. Constantly feeling torn 
between the pursuit of practicality and the 
pursuit of expressiveness. What is considered 
“artistically masterful” in one category of my 
life can easily be considered “impractical and 
uncanny” in another. Melo tugs on my heart in 
this way — he screams out about the dichotomy 
of identity and the utter helplessness it creates.

STEP #2: Community Influence on Identity

Melo sings over and over, “Hide your love, 
don’t let it slip away.”
We’ve all experienced it before — walking 
into a room and feeling like you have to hide a 
part of yourself, as it doesn’t quite fit in with 
the community at hand. In these lines, Melo 
speaks to the constant battle between feeling 
like you have to hide who you are in certain 
communities, yet not wanting this hidden part 
of yourself to “slip away.” The communities we 
reside in and draw comfort from provide us 
with the critical feeling of belongings; however, 
what happens when that community leans 
towards only one category, only one checkbox?
Melo speaks to wanting the support of the 
communities you are in, but not wanting the true 
parts of your identity to be stripped away from 
you. I began to ponder the trade-offs between 
embracing the support a community provides 
and conforming to the identity that community 
encourages “Hide” comments on feeling like 
certain worlds outcast and write-off the way 
you exist, but the “feeling of belongingness” 
that community provides is enough to make you 
stay: “Running from a place where they don’t 
make, people like me / I keep my bags packed, I 
keep my car running, I don’t wanna leave, just 
don’t wanna leave last.”
When you reveal a dimension of yourself 
and it doesn’t fit into the “traditional identity” 
that community holds, you repress it, for the 
support of those people is too valuable to lose. 
Melo keeps his bags packed, noting the second 
these repressed aspects of himself come to 
the surface, he has to be ready to leave. It’s 
scary to flee. Once again, in no way close to 
the intensity of Sam Melo’s situation, I lost 
the feeling of “wantedness” when I deviated 
from the mindsets my respective communities 
hold. When I conform to the identity my 
Business major provides, I feel comfort in those 
friendships, and vice versa with my English 
major. “Hide” speaks to that — “Hide” speaks 
to how my communities influence my existence.

STEP # 3: DO NOT 
Box Identity Into One 
Category!

Ultimately, “Hide” 
brings 
me 
to 
the 
realization that our 
identities 
shouldn’t, 
and don’t have to, 
fit 
into 
one 
box. 
Our 
communities 
today 
need 
to 
be 
increasingly aware of 
the realization that 
humans 
will 
never 
be one thing. Melo 
preaches 
against 
being limited to one 
identity — Melo has 
southern pride and 
he is also gay. Melo’s 
music is influenced 
by Schoolboy Q, Kings 
of Leon and Frank 
Ocean — a diverse set 
of 
influences 
from 
contemporary music. 
Melo 
contradicts 
himself, 
and 
that’s 
okay.
I, just like Melo, 
will never be one 
thing. I will walk 
through 
the 
halls 
of Ross all day long 
and 
preach 
about 
the latest novel I’m 
annotating. 
Simply 
put, that shouldn’t be 
a problem. We are all 
multifaceted humans, 
and the communities 
we reside in must 
learn not to back away 
or shame someone who deviates from what is 
“traditional” in that particular community, but 
rather to embrace the fact that our identities 
are never meant to be boxed into one category. 
I’m not a partial person, and I refuse to have an 
identity that is incomplete.
I’m done with consistently hiding facets of 
my life, and I’m done fitting into the easier 
parts of my identity. I’m done with the pursuit 
to “Hide” — and that’s thanks to you, Sam Melo.

FILM PREVIEW

In “Roma,” Alfonso Cuarón 
endeavors 
to 
render 
the 
intimacy and introspection 
of 
the 
memoir 
in 
three 
dimensions. The results are as 
stunning and moving as they 
are profoundly sad.
Cuarón selects a thoughtful 
angle from which to approach 
his personal history, focusing 
the camera on Cleo (Yalitza 
Aparicio in a breakout debut 
performance), 
the 
fictive 
counterpart 
of 
Lido, 
his 
family’s 
housekeeper 
who 
played 
a 
significant 
role 
in his upbringing in late 
20th-century 
Mexico 
City. 
And when I say “focus,” I 
mean the unwavering, intense 
kind that a person devotes to 
someone they love. This love 
guides the camerawork in 
compounding 
sequences 
as 
Cuarón slowly scans a site, be 
it the house Cleo takes care of, 
or the city block in which it’s 
nestled. The camera may very 
well visit other characters 
and objects, but once it stops, 
we wait with bated breath 
for a return. Every time, that 
awaited gravitational figure is 
Cleo.
In this respect and several 
others, 
Cuarón’s 
visual 
memoir doubles as a love letter 
to Lido, he even signs it “For 
Lido,” in the closing scene. 
This love letter hardly ever 
errs, crossing the divides of 
gender-based, socioeconomic 
and 
other 
privileges 
with 
grace and respect. Cuarón 
navigates 
these 
tensions 

adeptly, juxtaposing scenes 
that emphasize Cleo’s beloved 
status in the eyes of her 
employer’s 
children 
with 
reality-checks 
maintaining 
the family is not immune to 
seeing Cleo as their servant. 
In one scene, we are floored 
by 
breathtaking 
love 
as 
Cleo’s employer Ms. Sofia 
(played by Marina de Tavira, 
“Efectos Secundarios”) and 
her youngest child take turns 
holding Cleo as she cries 
for fear of an unexpected 
pregnancy. In the next scene, 
however, when her employer 
takes her to the family’s 
doctor to test for pregnancy, 
we watch Ms. Sofia speak 
for and infantilize Cleo — we 
sigh, and we ache for Cleo.
In Cuarón’s deep, matchless 
regard for his characters lies 
the distinct mode of realism 
that 
permeates 
“Roma.” 
With a keen eye for both the 
staggering 
tragedies 
that 
sideswipe us and the subtle 
ironies of life that mock us, 
Cuarón does not waste any time 
in fruitless pursuit of their 
source or rationalization for 
their inevitable occurrence. 
Instead, he pays homage to the 
women expected to suffer all 
of these in silence by telling of 
Ms. Sofia’s anguish and even 
more extensively of Cleo’s. 
Each abandoned by the men 
who were supposed to love 
and support them in large and 
small ways, these sufferings 
are palpable, at once resonant 
and incomprehensible.
And oh yes, “Roma” is sad. 
But its sadness is not the 
senseless, manipulative kind, 
buttressed by the logic that, 
on the one hand, you earn 
your audience’s sympathies 
by eliciting their tears, and, 
on the other hand, that you 
can 
justify 
this 
approach 
to 
sadness 
by 
calling 
it 
realism. 
“Roma” 
instead 
is distinguished by a fresh 
realism, for Cuarón refuses to 
narrate tragedy aimlessly or 
callously in a way that would 
justify drowning a character 

just 
to 
make 
a 
more 
convincing sea. Instead, he 
invests foremost and most 
deeply in his characters, 
romanticizing neither their 
suffering nor their triumphs. 
The chief return on this 
cumbersome but worthwhile 
investment 
in 
a 
more 
authentic realism is a world 
in which extraordinary love 
appears just as possible as 
extraordinary evil, a world 
in which we each have the 
choice to act in the name of 
either.
That might explain one 
of Cuarón’s visual motifs: 
airplanes. In the opening 
scene, one streaks across 
a patch of sky reflected in 
Cleo’s soapy water while she 
scrubs the family’s driveway; 
another airplane completes a 
parallel route in the closing 
scene, the camera aimed 
upwards 
this 
time, 
after 
having tracked Cleo laboring 
up a flight of stairs. As if to 
say, why do you still crane 
your neck? Why do you look 
to the sky for your heroes? 
There’s a hero, a saint, a 
miracle, right by your side. 
She sings to you softly in the 
morning to ensure you get to 
school on time. She calls you 
by your name. She doesn’t 
walk on water, but she would 
drown before she’d let you go 
under. Whether biological or 
surrogate, she’s your mother, 
and she loves you.
Could 
you 
imagine 
anything more extraordinary 
than that?

‘Roma’ renders radical

NEW MEDIA

When thinking about video 
games 
in 
2018, 
one 
thing 
probably comes to mind: 
“Fortnite.” The addictive game 
took over talk shows, Twitter 
and teenagers across the globe, 
but there was a lot more to this 
year in games than just dancing, 
armor-clad avatars. Here is 
Daily New Media’s picks for the 
five best video games of 2018.

1. 
“Red 
Dead 
Redemption 2”

“Red Dead Redemption 2” 
has the most detail I’ve ever 
seen in a game. Rockstar’s 
rendition of the American 
Old West is impeccable. Every 
action has an accompanying 
animation. I’ll be honest and 
say I haven’t even completed 
the story yet because I get lost 
in the realism of the world. The 
map is a gradient from modern 
industrialized cities on one 
side to untamed badlands on 
the other, and riding through 
it feels like a microcosm 
of 
America’s 
development 
into the nation we know 
today. 
That’s 
the 
beauty 
of “Red Dead Redemption 
2”: it gives you senseless 
murder 
and 
destruction, 
but it also provides political 
commentary on par with the 
highest and most pretentious 
of the arts because it, too, is a 
masterpiece.

2. “Super Smash 
Bros. Ultimate”

The best word to describe 
“Super Smash Bros. Ultimate” 
is 
ultimate. 
This 
iteration 
of “Super Smash Bros” has 
quickly proved itself to be the 
best in the franchise. Not only 
does “Smash Ultimate” include 
an impressive 76 characters 
(with more to come via DLC), 
many of the older characters 
have been updated with new 
moves and abilities. On top 
of that, “Smash Ultimate” 

just seems beefier: hits pack 
more punch, characters are 
more 
responsive 
and 
the 
music is enticingly epic. It 
always makes me want to 
play another round. I’ve been 
playing “Super Smash Bros” 
all my life, and I’ll admit that 
I probably haven’t even begun 
to master an eighth of all the 
characters “Smash Ultimate” 
offers. It just might be the 
new gold standard for fighting 
games. 

3. 
“Detroit: 
Become Human”

“Detroit: Become Human” 
is a game everyone should 
play. A departure from the 
usual shoot ‘em up violence 
that 
is 
ubiquitous 
in 
the 
game industry, “Detroit” is a 
narrative-based choice game 
in a class of its own. Set in 
a futurist version of Detroit 
where androids have become 
common, the player navigates 
the lives of three androids who 
find themselves in situations 
that 
test 
their 
morality, 
blurring the lines between 
human and machine. The best 
aspect of this game is that each 
story can be played differently. 
Due 
to 
multiple 
dialogue 
and action options for each 
decision, the player can inject 
as much personality into the 
characters as the developers 
can. “Detroit: Become Human” 
is an emotional rollercoaster 
and a model for what the game 
industry has the potential to 
be in the future.

4. 
“Marvel’s 
Spider-Man”

Like my newfound taste for 
mushrooms, I was surprised at 
how much I enjoyed “Spider-
Man.” Swinging between the 
beautiful 
and 
astoundingly 
accurate 
skyscrapers 
of 
Manhattan 
is 
a 
euphoric 
feeling few games can create. 
Despite 
a 
slight 
learning 
curve with the movement and 
combat, after an hour “Spider-

Man” becomes a game of fluid 
finesse. The story is heartfelt, 
the villains are a real threat 
and 
the 
characters 
are 
dynamic. I could play “Spider-
Man” for hours only swinging 
around the city — that’s how 
fun it is. 

5. “Fortnite”

You 
can 
say 
what 
you 
will 
about 
“Fortnite,” 
but 
one thing is true: The game 
dominated 2018. “Fortnite”’s 
Battle Royale mode united 
gamers young and old to 
bask in user-friendly, light-
hearted, cartoon murder. In 
2018, I personally devoted an 
embarrassing number of hours 
to the game. However, I also 
used “Fortnite” as a way to 
connect. As I enter my adult 
life, keeping in touch with 
old friends and relatives is 
difficult. Luckily “Fortnite” 
allows me to maintain these 
long-distance 
relationships 
while also letting me blow off 
steam after a long day. As an 
emerging international esport, 
I hope “Fortnite” continues to 
grow, and I’m eager to see the 
future content Epic Games 
releases this year.

It came up in conversation a 
short while ago that Verity and 
I were reading the same book — 
“Paradise Rot,” the debut novel of 
the Norwegian musician Jenny 
Hval. I asked Verity if she was 
interested in co-writing about 
Hval’s work, which is equally 
split between her writing and her 
musical projects, and would thus 
match our respective backgrounds 
in literature and music.
“Paradise Rot” is an enigmatic 
novel: It seems to sprawl beyond 
its 148 pages, extending its tendrils 
into all sorts of aesthetic and 
conceptual 
quandaries. 
Hval’s 
music is no less complex, both 
sonically and lyrically. It resists 
immediate 
comparison 
in 
no 
small part because of its variety. 
She’s capable of everything from 
drone metal to twangy folk, and 
frequently inhabits an in-between 
space all her own.
Additionally, 
Hval’s 
creative 
energies 
strain 
at 
the 
very 
boundaries of the media she uses: 
Her songs have a capital-P poetic 
dimension as well as a narrative 
and thematic thrust, and her prose 
writing can have the amorphous 
nature of her music, flitting and 
shifting between tropes, forms, 
and references and sometimes 
just dissolving into a network of 
sensuality and instinct.
I think we settled on publishing 
a kind of longform conversation 
(rather than a standard essay) in 
part because of Hval’s insistence 
of working on several levels at 
once. It’s difficult to draw only one 
conclusion from her work — really, 
it pulls in all directions, slipping out 
of the critical grasp right where it 
seems most solidified. I think the 
format of correspondence allows us 
to explore her artistic output from 
many angles at once, unbounded 
by definite conclusions or single 
threads to follow. We were also 
inspired by the “Slow Burn” series 
at Yale’s Post45 collective, which 
takes the form of correspondence 
between critics grappling with 
complex works of art.
I’ve always loved talking to 
people about what I’m reading or 
listening to, and I almost always 
find that it teaches me to think of 
the work in a new way. For an artist 
like Hval, fresh perspectives and 
unsettledness seem uniquely suited 
for providing insight in a way a 
more linear argument wouldn’t.

Dear Emily,
I 
tend 
to 
salivate 
over 
structure, 
which 
has 
never 
felt like a particularly popular 
or 
pleasant 
obsession 
(albeit 
useful). Jack Brandon will say 
“Capricorn,” but I massage my 
individuality by calling it a sort 
of personal interest in world 
building 
(Jack 
Brandon 
will 
repeat “Capricorn”). The person I 
am in the School of Information is 
not the one wandering the English 
Department, and walking on the 
street felt different when I got my 
haircut. You know? The delta in 
those experiences is so curious. 
Same person, different person. 
There, not there.
Structure is a pretty hot take 
in the literary world, especially 
right now. We hate it. Poetry 
challenges prose, which is in 

turn challenged by prose poetry. 
Creative nonfiction is a thing, 
arguably the thing of the moment. 
Genre-bending is a movement. 
MFA programs are branding 
as “experimental” and “non-
tracking.” Literati arranges such 
texts on a round table between

I picked up “Paradise Rot” 
because of its millennial bait cover 
design and bought it for the Chris 
Kraus endorsement on the back. 
Millennials bend genres, Chris 
Kraus bends genres, bending 

genres turn me on (so sinuous). 
Marketing did a precise job.
Except 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
“Paradise Rot” is not a genre-
bender. It presents as a novel, 
identifying as “fiction” on the 
flyleaf. And it checks the boxes: 
written in prose, organized into 
chapters and arranged around 
a classic storyline: Girl studies 
abroad, is awakened sexually. 
Formally, Hval isn’t all that bendy. 
I felt like I went into “Paradise 
Rot” all jazzed up for a circle and 
got a square.
This 
initially 
effected 
my 
reading. I actively despise feeling 
duped, even if I’m not actually 
being duped (spoiler). So the first 
impression I got from “Paradise 
Rot” was that of its structural 
failure. The plot is honestly 
weak, which leaves room for the 
characters to shine, but their 
development seems both half-
baked 
and 
disproportionate. 
(Why does the unremarkable, 
third-string Pym take up so much 
space?) For a square, it’s a pretty 
bad one.
Once my geometry metaphor 
angst wore off, though, I realized 
this “novel” was hitting me like 
a poem. While its structure fails 
to deliver, Hval’s language slowly 
and consistently designs a certain 
atmosphere. Her highly sensual 
descriptions (“my nails break, 
opening up like clams and in 
the finger flesh there are sticky 
little fruit pearls”) and consistent 
references 
to 
plant 
decay, 
moisture and general stickiness 
subtly adjusted my emotional 
thermostat. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
“Paradise Rot,” the environment 
in my brain, like the apartment 
that Jo and Carral share, had 
transformed. I was too distracted 
by lines and corners to notice it 
happening.
If Jenny Hval wanted to write 
a poem, she would have written 
a poem. If she wanted to write a 

piece that resisted the distinctions 
of prose and poetry, she would 
have marketed “Paradise Rot” 
as a genre-bender. She carefully 
incorporated all the necessary 
infrastructure 
to 
categorize 
“Paradise Rot” as Very Much 
Fiction, which is no casual effort. 
You don’t just “do it as a novel” for 
fun.
My lame brain wants the 
impossible 
— 
an 
answer 
— 
and I’m tempted to frame this 
novel 
as 
a 
structural 
coup 
d’état. Jenny Hval has written 
something that glaringly meets 
all the qualifications of a novel 
yet operates like a poem. It’s like 
a genre bending-genre bender … 
rather than creating something 
outside the system, she hijacks the 
system’s own machinery to unveil 
its categorization as construct.
My brain hurts. Write me back.

Dear Verity,
I have to admit that I’m much 
less attuned to narrative structure 
than you are. While I totally 
agree with your assessment of 
the novel’s plot, most of what I 
got out of “Paradise Rot” was 
the exhilarating rush of Hval’s 
language, 
her 
poetics 
and 
fixations. I think every good 
book changes, if temporarily, 
the reader’s relationship with 
the world. Accordingly, I found 
myself paying closer attention to 
the muddy patch of leaves in the 
front doorway to my house, to the 
tangle of plants in my backyard, to 
the echoes of dreams as I get ready 
in the morning. Jo’s porousness, 
her inability to keep the world 
from her mind, translated into 
a sticky awareness of the world 
around me as I read. I became 
attuned to the forces of growth 
and decay happening around me, 
all the time; I felt the wind go 
through me like a paper bag.
That having been said, my 
largest 
complaint 
about 
the 
novel is that the structure didn’t 
let the content be as windy, as 
continuous, as it seemed like 
it wanted to be. Its pacing and 
especially its organization into 
short chapters was at odds with 
the subject matter and the style 
of the prose. Jo’s narration felt so 
interior and reliant on sensation 
that I found myself wanting the 
formal boundaries to dissolve, for 
everything to mix together like 
paint in a sink. Chapters truncate, 
and there’s no truncating decay, 
which is an inexorable downward 
(and outward) flow. Hval seems 
to be emulating that organic 
structure without committing to 
making her novel resemble it on 
the macro scale.
I might give Hval more credit 
for bending genre than you do, 
though, or at least I think she 
plays with genre expectations in 
interesting ways. Even though 
the novel often works like a poem, 
it makes sense to me why it was 
“done” as a novel. The promise of a 
plot set me up to interact with her 
writing differently than I might if 
“Paradise Rot” had been done as a 
long poem or a film. The novelistic 
“infrastructure” is a signal for 
the reader to experience the text 
a certain way: We are to assume 
that all of this is happening, not 
as a metaphor or a stand-in for 
something 
else, 
but 
literally. 
Poems are slippery as to their 
literal meaning, prose is concrete, 
or at least seems so ... 

BOOKS DIALOGUE
A conversation, in decay

I think we settled 
on doing a kind 
of long-form 
conversation ... in 
part because of 
Hval’s insistence 
of working on 
several levels at 
once

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW

Artists’ Instagram pages are 
riddled with their beautiful 
finished 
photographs, 
drawings, paintings, etc. I 
rarely ever come across photos 
of 
the 
countless 
canvases 
thrown in the trash or the 
numerous photographs where 
the lighting was too low or the 
model wasn’t posed the correct 
way. I sit on chairs every day of 
my life, but seldom do I think 
about the engineering and 
logistical work it took to create 
those chairs. We are hardly 
ever exposed to the progress 
of a final piece of work. Most 
of the time, we only see the 
final piece of work itself. Yet, 
we must realize that through 
analyzing progress, we can 
learn a great deal about not 
only final pieces of work but the 
process of creation itself. The 
value in this examination is 
largely what inspired the Ann 
Arbor Arts Center’s upcoming 
exhibit: “Works in Progress.”
“I think the act of bringing 
an 
idea 
into 
its 
physical 
manifestation 
is 
beautiful,” 
said Sophie Yan, a curator for 
the event. “Works in Progress” 
is a celebration of the process 
of bringing functional works 
to 
life. 
This 
free 
exhibit 
features 
fashion, 
graphic 
design, furniture, architecture, 
industrial design and more. 
The 25 selected participants 
include working professionals, 
students and internationally 
exhibited 
designers. 
The 
“Works in Progress” exhibit’s 
opening party is an event for 
any one who values the beauty 
found in “the process.”
Yan has been making things 
since she was a little kid. 
Studying interior design in 
college and going on to study 
3D graphic design in graduate 

school, Yan now works as 
a 
hybrid 
interior/furniture 
designer 
and 
fabricator 
at 
Synecdoche, 
a 
design/
architecture studio in Ann 
Arbor. It is through Synecdoche 
that she became involved with 
the Ann Arbor Arts Center and 
“Works in Progress.”
“‘Works in Progress’ started 
when I met up with Matt 
Rosner, a fellow designer in 
Ann Arbor, and we talked 
about organizing a show as a 
way of getting local designers 
talking to each other and 
fostering a community,” Yan 
said. “I got my partner, Chris 
Czub, involved since he has 
experience organizing events. 
I pitched the idea to the Art 
Center and they had an opening 
in their exhibition schedule 
so it kind of all worked out 
perfectly.”
“I liked the idea of showing 
process 
materials 
and 
unfinished work as a way of 
gaining insight into the artist 
or designer’s practice,” Yan 
said. “The original purpose 
of the show was to foster a 
community, so I thought that 
this would be a good way to 
get folks talking to each other. 
Besides, I feel that we as 
audiences always see only the 
finished result and often the 
developmental work that went 
into it goes unnoticed. I wanted 
to celebrate that for once.”
The show is intended to 
be a discussion space for 
creators and designers as well 
as to showcase the progress 
of works of art. Yan will be 
showing some textile samples 
that she has been accumulating 
in her studio over the years. 
A large part of the show 
focuses on both the beauty 
and the chaos in creation. 
While Yan believes the act of 
bringing an idea into a physical 
manifestation is beautiful, she 
said “The process of getting 

there, however, is sometimes 
chaotic. Ideas have a tendency 
to bounce off of each other 
and grow exponentially. Not 
every idea deserves to be fully 
realized, and the hard part is 
often knowing when to move 
on from something and when 
to push through and commit. I 
like to experiment openly with 
different 
materials 
without 
thinking about the end result. I 

end up with lots of half-baked 
ideas waiting for the perfect 
application.”
As creators, it is important 
to see the process of other 
creators and how that process 
can or cannot apply to your 
own work. “Works in Progress” 
is 
an 
exhibit 
for 
anyone 
interested in the behind-the-
scenes of creation. The opening 
party is an event for creators to 
network with one another and 
discuss the design process as 
well. For a Friday night filled 
with creative thinking and 
discussion, I’d suggest heading 
over to Ann Arbor Arts Center. 
You may leave wanting to scrap 
some of your old ideas or bring 
a brand new idea to life. “Works 
in Progress” will be on display 
at the Arts Center from Jan. 11 
to Feb. 9.

An outdoor mirage
T

he win at Notre Dame was 
supposed to be a turning 
point.
Senior defenseman and captain 
Joseph Cecconi said as much after 
the Michigan hockey team beat 
the Fighting Irish, 4-2, at Notre 
Dame Stadium 
on Saturday.
“We all 
know that 
it’s time to 
turn this ship 
around, and 
all it takes is 
one win,” Cec-
coni said. “It’s 
three points 
for us, and 
we’re going to play Tuesday and 
just going to continue (to) go on. It 
doesn’t matter if it’s a league game 
or not, and we’re just excited that 
we got the win and it’s going to 
turn us around a bit.”
But when Merrimack — ranked 
52nd of 60 teams in the Pairwise 
before Tuesday’s game against 
the Wolverines — came to Ann 
Arbor, Michigan found itself fail-
ing to build on the momentum 
from Saturday’s win.
To put it simply, the Wolverines 
fell on their faces in the 4-2 loss.
The Warriors average just 1.81 
goals per game. Michigan gave 
up more than double that, includ-
ing two in a span of less than five 
minutes.
In many ways, the perfor-
mance mirrored the Wolverines’ 
season-opening loss to Vermont. 
Both losses were riddled with 
defensive lapses and an overall 
lack of respect for the opponent. 
But in that game against the 
Catamounts, Michigan had the 
excuse of being a young team still 
trying to come together and find 
chemistry.
“I thought we weren’t ready 
to play tonight,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson after falling 
to Vermont. “We weren’t really 
ready to play. We came in today 
with the mindset that it was going 
to be easy.”
But nothing has been easy for 
the Wolverines thus far.

Michigan skidded through the 
first half of the season. The Wol-
verines won a weekend series only 
once in the first half, when they 
swept St. Lawrence — which has a 
3-14-1 on the season and rank 59th 
in Pairwise — in late October. 
Michigan has also tied six times 
in the first 19 games.
All of that was supposed to 
change with the win over the 
Fighting Irish — a victory over 
one of the nation’s top teams on 
the road. The win snapped a nine-
game winless streak that dated to 
mid-November — and the Wol-
verines won without sophomore 
forward Josh Norris and sopho-
more defenseman Quinn Hughes, 
arguably their two best players.
The cards seemed to be set for 
Michigan to get back on track and 
make a run through the second 
half of the season, just as it did last 
year, when the Wolverines swept 
No. 9 Minnesota in the second 
weekend of the second half and 
ended up in the Frozen Four.
And then Merrimack hap-
pened.
“Not prepared to play, and 
that’s up to each player to be ready 
to play,” Pearson said after the 
loss. “We were worried as coach-
es, you go from playing Notre 

Dame and you got Ohio State on 
the back end and you got this mid-
week game.
“Couple comments from our 
team, ‘We didn’t take them seri-
ous’ or whatever. I don’t know 
how you can, because we’re not 
that good. We have to take every 
team serious to have a chance to 
win.”
Michigan didn’t take the War-
riors seriously, and now its chance 
to build on the momentum of the 
win at Notre Dame is gone.
Once again, just like in the 
Vermont game, the Wolverines 
weren’t ready and ended up los-
ing to an opponent they should’ve 
handily beaten.
There are no more excuses.
Michigan has had 21 games and 
over three months to get ready to 
play. Now, with the second half of 
the Big Ten season looming, the 
Wolverines are running out of 
time to figure things out.
This weekend, Michigan will 
visit No. 4 Ohio State, which leads 
the Big Ten with 20 points and a 
5-2-3 conference record. The Wol-
verines sit third with 15 points, 
and a sweep of the Buckeyes could 
put them in first place.
But that’s a tall order for a team 
that just lost to bottom-dwelling 

Merrimack and fell to Ohio State 
all five times the two programs 
met last season.
“They had our number last 
year,” said junior forward Jake 
Slaker Tuesday after the loss. 
“We played them five times and 
they beat us five times. We’re not 
happy with that, and we know 
how — they have a strong team.
“We’re going to go in there and 
we got to throw the whole kitchen 
sink at them. We got to really go 
at them and try to grab as many 
points as we can, because the Big 
Ten’s tight right now and these 
are huge games for us.”
Slaker is right. This weekend is 
a huge series for Michigan.
There isn’t any more time for 
talk of turning points or spring-
boards or any other cliché about 
how a struggling team can save a 
season.
It’s time for the Wolverines to 
turn talk into action.
If they don’t, the win over 
Notre Dame will become simply 
one good win in a lost season.

At midpoint, Michigan 
remains up and down

The ball danced around the 
rim for a few moments before 
falling out of the cylinder and 
landing harmlessly on the floor 
as the final buzzer sounded. 
The game had been decided by 
only one point. This was the 
scenario that played out for the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team in each of its last two 
games, against Purdue and 
Northwestern, respectively. 
The Wolverines (11-5 overall, 
2-2 Big Ten), though, were on 
different ends of the spectrum 
in each of those games. Against 
the 
Boilermakers, 
Michigan 
watched as its final shot failed to 
fall while, against the Wildcats, 
the Wolverines watched with 
the same helpless feeling as, 
this time, their opponent’s shot 
rolled out of the rim. 
Despite 
being 
picked 
to 
finish third in the Big Ten 
in 
the 
coaches’ 
preseason 
vote, Michigan now sits in a 
three-team tie for sixth place 
through the first four games of 
conference play. One reason for 
its current record is because of 
trends like this one: One day 
the ball rolls the way of the 
Wolverines while the next day 
it goes the opposite direction. 
With two conference home 
wins and a pair of losses 
at 
Purdue 
and 
Nebraska, 
Michigan’s play in the Big Ten 
has so far been a microcosm for 
their season performance as a 
whole. 
There have been flashes of 
brilliance, like its thrashing 
of 
Missouri 
and 
No. 
18 
Minnesota, 
and 
moments 
of disappointment, like the 
Wolverines’ back-to-back losses 
against No. 8 NC State and 
No. 15 Marquette as well as 
that heartbreaking loss to the 
Boilermakers last Saturday.
Yet, one thing that Michigan 

has consistently done well is 
defend its home court. The 
Wolverines are 7-0 at home this 
season compared to just 4-5 
when they are away from the 
Crisler Center.
“We 
really 
challenged 
ourselves 
in 
the 
offseason 
against 
some 
great 
competition,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico. “We 
went on the road and we’ve been 
on the road, we’ve had a lot more 
road games than home contests, 
in preparation for the long haul; 
in preparation for the Big Ten 
Tournament; in preparation for 
the NCAA Tournament. 
“What we have found is that 
taking those bumps and losing 
those games (is) tough, but 
now we came out with a couple 
of really good wins. So those 
games have prepared us and are 
(continuing to) prepare us.” 
Of the Wolverines’ 14 games 
remaining, half are on the road 
while the other half will take 
place in Ann Arbor. 
If 
its 
current 
trajectory 
continues 
— 
winning 
its 
remaining home games and 
losing 
its 
remaining 
road 
games 
—Michigan 
will 
finish 18-12. That will almost 
certainly not be enough come 
NCAA 
Tournament 
time, 
barring a Big Ten Tournament 
championship.
Midway through the season, 
Barnes Arico has taken away 
the positives from her squad’s 
road performances thus far 
and is hopeful they can turn it 
around.
“I think the way our league 
has gone so far has kind of 
showed us that, ‘Hey, we can 
have a night where we’re not 
happy with the outcome, but 
we can’t put everything on the 
outcome of the game,’ ” Barnes 
Arico said. “If we are continuing 
to improve, then we are going to 
be a great program down the 
stretch.” 

Five keys to the Wolverines upsetting ninth-ranked Terrapins on the road

Last season, the Michigan 
women’s basketball team all but 
saved its season with a 71-65 
win over then-No. 13 Maryland, 
which went a long way in 
ensuring the Wolverines a berth 
in the NCAA Tournament.
Though it is just over halfway 
through 
the 
season, 
the 
importance of Michigan (11-5 
overall, 2-2 Big Ten) visiting 
College Park to take on the 
9th-ranked Terrapins (14-1, 3-1) 
cannot be overstated. Just like 
last year, a positive result for 
the Wolverines could push them 
over the line come the end of 
the season. A loss, on the other 
hand, could cripple their already 
tenuous position on the NCAA 
Tournament bubble.
Michigan 
enters 
the 
contest off the back of a hard-
fought overtime win against 
Northwestern, while Maryland 
will also be riding high following 
an 
18-point 
demolition 
of 
Nebraska.
The Daily breaks down the 
keys to Saturday’s Big Ten clash.
Michigan’s struggles away 
from home
It is safe to say that Crisler 
Center 
has 
been 
friendly 
to Michigan. All five of the 
Wolverines’ losses this season 
have been away from home and 
they have averaged just over 
61 points and 17.4 turnovers in 
these road losses. 
In 
contrast, 
Michigan 
is 
averaging 
81 
points 
per 
game and 15.05 
turnovers at home. 
The 
Wolverines 
notched a home 
upset over No. 12 
Minnesota, 
but 
have 
struggled 
to 
defeat 
even 
mediocre 
teams 
away 
from 
Crisler.
In addition, with freshmen 
Amy Dilk and Naz Hillmon 
in the rotation, and only a 
few 
upperclassmen 
playing 
significant minutes, Michigan 
has 
lacked 
the 
experience 

needed to beat ranked teams on 
their turf.
“I think our message has been 
‘Continue to improve, continue to 
improve,’ ” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “We’re trying 
not to look at the outcomes but 
to look at the process. Hopefully, 
our improvement in practice will 
result in victories. But it’s more 
of a focus on improvement than 
just results.”
Still, results matter and a win 
against the Terrapins would be 
the Wolverines’ best result to 
this point of the season.
Controlling the boards
The 
rebounding 
battle 
will also be a major factor in 
Saturday’s outcome.
“Maryland does a tremendous 
job 
of 
rebounding 
the 
basketball,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We have to make sure we block 
and hold them to one shot.”
Rebounding 
has 
been 
a 
strength 
for 
both 
squads 
throughout the first half of 
the 
season. 
Both 
Michigan 
and Maryland are in the top-
10 nationally in total team 
rebounds 
and 
rebounding 
margin — though the Terrapins 
have a slight advantage in both 
categories.
Maryland’s only loss this 
season came at home to Rutgers. 
It is no coincidence that game 
is one of only two in which the 
Terrapins were outrebounded, 
giving up a season-high 19 
offensive rebounds to the Scarlet 
Knights.
“They 
are 
big, long and 
athletic,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“They 
really 
have 
a 
motor 
to 
the 
basketball, 
so we have to 
make 
contact 
with them. It’s 
going to be key 
for us to make sure they don’t 
have multiple chances.”
Kaila Charles
There are only three Big Ten 
players on the midseason John 
R. Wooden Award watch list: 
Minnesota guard Kenisha Bell, 
Iowa forward Megan Gustafson 

and Maryland’s do-it-all guard 
Kaila Charles.
At 6-foot-1, Charles possesses 
unique 
size 
for 
the 
guard 
position. 
“She is an incredible player,” 
Barnes Arico said. “She’s really 
a tough matchup for anyone. She 
can go off the bounce, she can 
elevate over you, can go left or 
right, pull-up in 
front of you. She 
is really just an 
incredible scorer. 
We’re just going 
to have to keep 
the 
basketball 
out of her hands.”
Even 
though 
Charles’s 
offensive 
production 
has 
fallen off slightly 
from last season — when she 
was an All-Big Ten First team 
selection — she still leads the 
Terrapins in scoring and has lit 
up the scoresheet on multiple 
occasions already this season, 
reaching double figures in all but 
one game this season.

It’s no small task, but if the 
Wolverines are able to limit 
Charles’ offensive opportunities, 
they will have a chance to pull 
off the upset.
The point guard matchup
It has been an inconsistent 
season for Dilk. The heralded 
recruit has undoubtedly shown 
signs of brilliance in her short 
time 
at 
the 
helm 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offense. And yet, 
as 
with 
most 
young 
players, 
there have been 
growing pains.
In 
recent 
games, 
her 
confidence 
and 
decision making 
have 
been 
on 
the rise. She had solid offensive 
outputs against both Minnesota 
and Purdue, scoring 14 and 16 
points, respectively, with just 
three combined turnovers.
Though the offensive burden 
does not fall squarely on Dilk’s 
shoulders, there appears a clear 

improvement 
in 
Michigan’s 
offense when she looks to score.
“Her ability to score the 
basketball really gives us a 
different 
dimension,” 
Barnes 
Arico said. “It helps to not pack 
the paint against (senior center) 
Hallie (Thome) and Naz inside. 
So she has the green light on 
offense and is getting more and 
more comfortable. She has done 
really well for us recently.”
Dilk’s counterpart on the 
Maryland sideline is freshman 
Taylor Mikesell. Mikesell is 
the Terrapins’ second-leading 
scorer behind Charles, averaging 
14.8 points per game. Dilk’s best 
offensive asset is her three-point 
shot — hitting a 42.3 percent rate 
beyond the arc.
Dilk will be tasked with 
guarding Mikesell. Job number 
one 
will 
be 
minimizing 
Mikesell’s opportunities from 
deep, an area where Dilk is quite 
capable. Her size and athleticism 
were one of the reasons she was 
a five-star recruit out of high 
school. In order to win the 
matchup against Mikesell, and 

put Michigan in a position to 
leave College Park with a win, 
Dilk will have to play smart 
and 
aggressive 
on 
offense 
and be mindful of Mikesell’s 
movements when the Terrapins 
are in possession.
Last word
The odds don’t favor Michigan 
in this matchup — especially 
against Maryland in its home 
arena. Charles and Mikesell 
are potent offensively, but the 
Terrapins run deeper than that 
duo. With that said, there have 
been a number of surprising 
results in the Big Ten so far 
this season, and the Wolverines 
have already pulled an upset of 
their own against the Golden 
Gophers. Despite its youth and 
struggles on the road, a Michigan 
victory against Maryland would 
not necessarily be the most 
surprising. 
Controlling 
the 
boards, containing Kaila Charles 
as much as possible and winning 
the point guard matchup will 
be pivotal if the Wolverines 
hope to beat the Terrapins in 
consecutive seasons.

Gattis picked to be OC

After a season of ambiguity, 
the Michigan football team has 
an offensive coordinator, and a 
designated play-caller.
The Wolverines have hired 
Josh 
Gattis 
— 
Alabama’s 
co-offensive 
coordinator 
and 
wide receivers coach — to fill 
the job, the team announced in 
a statement. Bruce Feldman and 
Chris Vannini of The Athletic 
first reported the news. Gattis is 
expected to call plays, according 
to Feldman. A spokesperson for 
the team did not immediately 
respond 
to 
a 
request 
for 
comment.
“The offense and passing 
games under Josh’s direction 
have achieved at a very high level 
throughout his coaching career,” 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said in a statement. “Josh will 
provide leadership to our offense 
while being a great mentor to 
our student-athletes and an 
outstanding addition to our 
coaching staff. Michigan football 
looks forward to having Josh, 
Tesa, and their children, Jace 
and Reece, join our University 
family.”
The news comes as a shock, not 
just because it means Harbaugh 
cedes control of the offense, but 
because Harbaugh said after 
the Wolverines lost in the Peach 
Bowl that he didn’t anticipate 
any changes to his coaching staff.
There 
had 
already 
been 
two — Greg Mattison and Al 
Washington leaving for Ohio 
State — but those departures 
seemed 
out 
of 
Harbaugh’s 
control. Moreover, both were 
defensive coaches. An offensive 
hire, at a time when Harbaugh is 
under fire for the way his offense 
performed in big games against 
Ohio State and Florida, could 
represent a deliberate shift.
Designating 
a 
play-caller 
certainly 
does 
just 
that. 
Harbaugh 
had 
previously 
refused to say who was calling 

plays when asked, though it 
seemed to be a mix of himself 
and passing game coordinator 
Pep Hamilton.
Gattis, who had a one-year 
NFL 
playing 
career, 
played 
college football at Wake Forest 
and has been a coach since 2010. 
Most notably, he coached wide 
receivers at Penn State before 
going to Tuscaloosa.
“Josh is a very good coach,” 
Alabama 
coach 
Nick 
Saban 
said of Gattis in October, per 
AL.com. “He’s a very bright guy. 
He’s been in some good systems. 
He has a good understanding 
of the big picture offensively. 
He’s very technical in terms of 
how he coaches and teaches his 
players and they have a good 
understanding.
“He 
has 
a 
really 
good 
personality. 
But 
he’s 
also 
demanding. He can confront 
and demand guys when they’re 
not doing things the way they’re 
supposed to do them and I think 
that’s created a lot of consistency 
in our receivers and it’s also 
improved 
their 
toughness 
and their mental toughness to 
sustain.”
In Gattis’ lone year with the 
Crimson Tide, Alabama led the 
nation in passing S&P+, thanks 
in large part to quarterback Tua 
Tagovailoa. Gattis also helped 
receiver Jerry Jeudy to a 1,315-
yard season in which he won the 
Fred Biletnikoff Award for the 
nation’s best wideout.
After a week in which things 
seemed to be falling apart for the 
Wolverines, this hire seems like 
an attempt to start righting the 
ship.
“I am deeply humbled by the 
opportunity to serve as your 
offensive coordinator,” Gattis 
said in a statement. “This is 
the leadership challenge I’ve 
coveted. The football tradition 
at the University of Michigan is 
among the very best in college 
athletics. My family and I 
couldn’t be more excited to 
arrive in Ann Arbor.”

New hire shows Harbaugh willing to evolve
T

here are lots of myths 
about Jim Harbaugh.
One such myth, a sen-
timent that has gained traction 
following the tumultuous end to 
Michigan’s season, is that he is 
unwilling to 
adapt. This 
caricature of 
Harbaugh’s 
offensive 
philosophy 
— a relic of a 
bygone era, 
too proud 
to conform 
to modern 
football, too 
stubborn to 
adapt to his personnel — is largely 
unfounded. But it persists and 
is only amplified with every loss 
in a big game — every lackluster 
offensive performance. 
The hiring of former Alabama 
co-offensive coordinator Josh 
Gattis to become the offensive 
coordinator (yes, the sole offen-
sive coordinator) at Michigan is 
the latest and most discernible 
proof of Harbaugh’s willingness 
to evolve. 
Gattis is going to run the 
offense. He’s going to be call-
ing plays. And the subtext isn’t 
hard to see here: He’s coming to 
change the entire offense. Har-
baugh’s offense.
To say Michigan’s offense 
didn’t change in 2018 would be 
wrong. After 2017, a year in which 
Michigan’s three quarterbacks 
combined for just nine touch-
down passes and less than 2,300 
passing yards, the offense reflect-
ed and rebounded. This past 
season, junior quarterback Shea 
Patterson threw for 2,600 yards 
and 22 touchdowns. The Wol-
verines had three wide receivers 
exceed 500 yards. While that 
figure might seem uninspiring, 
it comes after a year in which no 
receiver exceeded 307 yards. 
And it wasn’t just that the 
offense opened up, but the way 
it did so. Harbaugh ostensibly 
ceded run-game responsibilities 
to offensive line coach Ed Warin-
ner this season. In turn, the team 

implemented more zone-read 
looks and more run-pass options. 
There were new formations and 
an emphasis on getting Patterson 
on the move to best utilize his 
athleticism.
Harbaugh adapted in 2018, no 
doubt, just as he has his entire 
career. But hiring Gattis and 
relinquishing all play-calling 
duties isn’t mere adaptation. It’s a 
complete offensive overhaul, and 
a welcome one at that.
From 2012 to 2017, Gattis 
worked under James Franklin at 
both Vanderbilt and Penn State, 
where he quickly developed a rep-
utation for his recruiting prowess. 
In his lone season at Alabama, 
Gattis led an offense that aver-
aged 522 yards over 45 points 
per game. Quarterback Tua 
Tagovailoa averaged 11.17 yards 
per attempt, narrowly behind 
Heisman Trophy-winner Kyler 
Murray for tops in the nation. 
Tagovailoa also finished with an 
adjusted completion percentage 
of 63.4 on throws of 20-plus yards 
downfield. When presented with 

that information on Twitter, Gat-
tis provided a response sure to be 
music to Wolverines fans’ ears.
“Well we sure do see who is 
on this list and not! “ he tweeted. 
“No dink and dunk offense here!”
No dink-and-dunk offense, 
you say? 
And while to an extent Ala-
bama is Alabama, and Michigan 
is decidedly not, the Wolverines 
would be wise to take lessons 
from the Crimson Tide’s offensive 
evolution in the last five years.
Michigan will bring back 
Patterson, along with talented 
sophomore wide receivers Dono-
van Peoples-Jones, Tarik Black 
and Nico Collins next season. It 
retains most of its offensive line 
and brings in a talented run-
ning back, Zach Charbonnet, to 
an already versatile group. The 
group has the potential to be the 
Wolverines’ most talented offense 
in years. And with Gattis, it has 
added the most important ingre-
dient: a fresh, forward-thinking 
offensive mind necessary to 
reaching new heights.

This is all, of course, contin-
gent on Harbaugh truly handing 
the keys over. Any team coached 
by Harbaugh is going to maintain 
some elements of the pro-style 
offense he’s run his entire life. 
The working marriage of Har-
baugh and Gattis now serves 
as perhaps the most important 
offseason development. If the 
offensive collaboration remains 
the convoluted bureaucratic 
entanglement it has been the past 
few years, criticism will rightly 
follow. 
But Harbaugh had no choice 
to broadly evaluate the short-
comings of last season. He, too, 
watched his offense wilt at Notre 
Dame in the season opener. He 
saw it thoroughly outpaced and 
outclassed at Ohio State. He had 
a front-row seat to the 26-point 
Peach Bowl drubbing.
To his credit, it now appears, 
Harbaugh adapted.

CHAMPAIGN 
— 
Almost 
exactly two years ago to the day, 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team lost 85-69 at Illinois, 
allowing the Fighting Illini to 
shoot a scorching 65 percent 
from the field and the 3-point 
line.
But in the eyes of Wolverines 
fans, Jan. 11, 2017 is more 
notable 
for 
Illinois 
center 
Maverick 
Morgan 
dumping 
a 
truckload 
of 
salt 
into 
the 
wound 
with 
his 
postgame 
comments, 
in 
which he called 
Michigan 
a 
traditionally 
“white-collar” 
team.
At 
the 
time, 
Morgan’s 
statement marked a nadir for 
the Wolverines. But since then, 
Michigan’s gone 64-14, with 
two Big Ten Tournament titles 
and a Final Four appearance.
Thursday 
night, 
the 
Wolverines returned to the 
State Farm Center for the first 
time in two years. They left 
with a 79-69 win over the Illini 
and a 16-0 record — tied for the 
best start in program history.
At the same time, though, it 
wasn’t a dominant win. Illinois 
(4-12 overall, 0-5 Big Ten) 
outshot Michigan and forced 
14 turnovers, never letting the 
game get out of hand as the 
records would suggest.
If there was a time where it 
could have gotten out of hand, 
it was right after tip-off. The 
Wolverines (16-0, 5-0) came out 
of the gate looking every bit the 
second-best team in the nation, 
scoring the game’s first eight 
points.
Sophomore forward Isaiah 
Livers missed the previous two 
games with back spasms, but if 
one was watching Michigan for 
the first time Thursday night, 
they would have no idea. The 

sophomore 
forward 
scored 
an early seven points with a 
soft turnaround jumper, a left-
handed and-one layup and a 
leaping offensive rebound and 
putback, helping the Wolverines 
go up 20-10 after eight minutes.
“We obviously missed him,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beilein. “ … Having Isaiah come 
over to defend, do different 
things 
and 
just 
have 
him 
coming off the 
bench is huge 
for us.”
But 
Illinois, 
thanks 
to 
its 
signature 
high-pressure 
defense, 
hung 
around 
throughout the 
first half. The 
Wolverines 
coughed it up 11 
times, and Ayo 
Dosunmu — who scored 19 first-
half points — banked home a 
deep 3-pointer to cut the Illini 
deficit to 39-34 at the half.
“Our coaches got on us about 
our turnovers,” said junior 
point guard Zavier Simpson. “ … 
Just told us to pivot better, find 
the open guy, make the extra 
pass and just stay disciplined. 
With them pressuring, they’re 
going to try to wear us down. 
You’re going to get tired as the 
game goes on, but it’s important 
that you just stay mentally 
disciplined.”
Michigan 
heeded 
these 
words in the second half. 
Despite being unable to pull 
away entirely, the final 20 
minutes were a different story, 
as Dosunmu scored just two 
points, the Wolverines turned 
it over just twice and scored 10 
points in transition.
They have Simpson — who 
had 16 points, eight assists, five 
rebounds and two steals — to 
thank. In the second half, he hit 
two key fast-break layups and a 
3-pointer with five minutes to 
play, a crucial stiff-arm after an 
Illinois three sliced the lead to 
63-56.
Beilein stated that Simpson’s 

firm hand on the steering wheel 
allowed Michigan to adapt to 
the Illini pressure, in spite of 
most of the Wolverines’ normal 
offensive sets breaking down.
“The way that Illinois plays, 
you’re not going to be able to 
run a lot of plays anyhow, you 
gotta just get guys in formations 
and attack,” Beilein said. “As a 
result, when we did settle down 
I thought they got the message. 
Any other time that they got 
close — I look at Zavier, and 
I got as good a point guard as 
there is in the country running 
our team.”
Illinois 
didn’t 
seriously 
threaten 
again. 
Michigan, 
hitting just 65 percent of its 
foul shots coming into the 
game, nailed six free throws 
in the final minute as the Illini 
resorted to fouling — icing the 
contest away.
When the buzzer sounded, 
the 
Wolverines 
equaled 
a 
historic start at the site of one 
of the biggest embarrassments 
of the Beilein era.
And the fashion they did it in 
— responding to adversity with 
clutch plays down the stretch — 
was decidedly not white collar.

CHAMPAIGN — For 35 minutes 
on Thursday night at the State Farm 
Center, Illinois would not go away. 
Every time the Michigan men’s 
basketball team threatened to silence 
the Fighting Illini, they responded 
with a pair of stubborn baskets, 
serving solely to prolong a game with 
a seemingly inevitable outcome.
Thanks to junior point guard 
Zavier Simpson, the last of these 
insurgencies culminated at the 5:26 
mark, when a fastbreak basket cut 
the Illinois deficit to seven. Simpson 
collected the ball off the ensuing 
inbounds, calmly dribbling up the 
court as he typically does before 
running the Wolverines’ offense.
Only this time, his trip up the 
court ended just beyond the 3-point 
line, where he stopped on a dime 
and fired up an ambitious 3-pointer. 
A 26.5 percent 3-point shooter 
on the season, it seemed like an 
uncharacteristic 
mental 
mistake 
from Simpson — until the ball 
splashed through the hoop, grazing 
nothing but net on its way in and 
silencing the Illini crowd one last 
time.
“Any time you hit a three when a 
team’s chipping back at the lead, I feel 

like it’s good,” Simpson said. “I just 
wanted to step in and just knock it 
down.”
On a team with five rotation 
players shooting over 33 percent 
from deep, Simpson might have been 
the last player expected to ice the 
game with a three. But that ability 
to get contributions no matter who it 
turned to is what allowed Michigan 
to 
overcome 
a 
strong 
Illinois 
performance and win, 79-69.
Just 36 seconds into the game, 
redshirt junior forward Charles 
Matthews bowled into an Illini 
defender, committing his first foul of 
the evening. Wolverines coach John 
Beilein responded by turning to his 
bench, glancing over his options, 
and summoning sophomore forward 
Isaiah Livers.
It’s a luxury that Beilein hasn’t 
had in nearly two weeks, but Livers 
took full advantage on Thursday, 
opening the scoring with a jumper 
from the elbow and scoring seven of 
Michigan’s first 17 points.
“We 
obviously 
missed 
him 
(when he was injured),” Beilein said. 
“Especially when Charles (fouled) 
like 50 seconds into this game. So 
having Isaiah come over, defend, do 
different things, and just have him 
coming off the bench is huge for us. … 

We need him on this team, he’s been 
a real secret to our success.”
After Livers’ initial spurt, Illinois 
adapted, holding him scoreless for 
the next 30 minutes. In his stead, 
Matthews returned with 11 second-
half points — one of five Wolverines 
to finish in double figures.
Junior center Jon Teske was 
Michigan’s most impressive player 
for much of the evening, finishing 
with 13 points and 11 rebounds. When 
the Illini got within four points early 
in the second half, Teske — a 21 
percent 3-point shooter — was the 
one who replenished the Wolverines’ 
advantage with a pick-and-pop three. 
Three minutes later, he used a three-
point play to stymie a mini-Illinois 
run.
Even freshman forward Ignas 
Brazdeikis — flummoxed by the 
Illini’s high pressure defense early on 
— finished with 15 points, including 
six in a four-minute stretch midway 
through the second half. After an 
early three, his last three field goals 
all came inside the paint, as did 42 of 
Michigan’s 79 points.
“This team has four or five guys 
that just scare the tar out of you with 
dribble drive,” said Illinois coach 
Brad Underwood. “And that causes 
matchup problems.”
As usual, though, it all ran through 
Simpson, who added eight assists and 
just two turnovers to his 16 points.
“Yeah, they didn’t take the ball 
out of Zavier’s hands,” Underwood 
said, when asked to explain the 
Wolverines’ second half offensive 
improvement.
“Find the open man,” Simpson 
added. “If they’re personal like 
that, they’re definitely gonna try to 
wear you down, get in the gaps. It’s 
important that your decision making 
is precise. But at the same time, teams 
like this, you gotta just go, you gotta 
just play. … And I feel like we’re a very 
unselfish team, so if everyone just 
plays the right way, finds the open 
man, we’ll get quality shots.”
Ask Beilein and he’ll tell you that it 
doesn’t matter who those open shots 
fall to. But the answer from the other 
sideline might be more revealing.
“I think they showed tonight 
why they’re such a good basketball 
team,” Underwood said. “They had 
everybody in double figures.”
