ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Event intended to 

tie with World 

AIDS Day 

advocacy efforts

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

University students have host-

ed performances of the popular 
stage play “The Vagina Mono-
logues” for years. But on Friday, 
the University’s Black Student 
Union and the National Council 
of Negro Women teamed up to 
present “The HIV Monologues.”

Presented in the University 

of Michigan Museum of Art, the 
production aimed to educate 
students about people who are 
HIV-positive and destigmatize 
common stereotypes affiliated 
with the disease.

The monologues were affili-

ated with World AIDS Day 
— an international movement 
typically held on Dec. 1 that calls 
on the world community to sup-

port those diagnosed with HIV, 
remember those who have died 
from the disease and rally sup-
port behind efforts aimed at pre-
vention and treatment.

Friday’s event featured a mix 

of spoken-word monologues and 
personal accounts of those who 
have been affected by HIV in 
some way. This is the second time 
the BSU and NCNW have orga-
nized the HIV Monologues; the 
first occurred in winter 2014.

LSA 
juniors 
Williamena 

Kwapo and Micah Griggs, mem-
bers of the NCNW and organizers 
of the event, said they decided to 
bring the event back after realiz-
ing how important it was to dis-
cuss HIV issues with the campus 
community.

Kwapo noted that college stu-

dents rarely discuss the large-
scale effect of HIV, and Griggs 
said this silence often lends itself 
to the recycling of uninformed, 
negative stereotypes.

“There’s definitely a negative 

connotation associated with HIV, 
and there’s definitely a stigma

CAMPUS LIFE

Biennial celebration 
on North Campus 

includes hovercrafts, 

rocket-building

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

Middle schoolers filled the 

Aerospace Engineering building 
on North Campus on Saturday, 

convening to build rockets and 
fly hovercrafts as part of the 
third biennial Aerospace Day.

Throughout 
the 
day, 
the 

140 middle school students in 
attendance rotated through a 
series of eight activities, and 
observed a blimp and hovercraft 
competition 
for 
University 

engineering students. Freshmen 
and sophomores in the College 
of 
Engineering 
constructed 

blimps and hovercrafts from 
scratch through their various 

classes, then brought them to the 
competition, where they timed 
how long they took to fly through 
a course

The 
Aerospace 
Day 

culminated with the completion 
of a mega-blimp built by groups 
of 
students 
throughout 
the 

day. Each team built a different 
section of the blimp, and the final 
product was flown at the end of 
the day.

Engineering 
senior 
Caue 

Borlina, who helped organize 

the event, said the day’s activities 
sought to increase exposure of 
the aerospace field.

“We want more people to 

study aerospace engineering,” 
he said. “The greatest thing is 
we have 90 volunteers from 
the department … The energy 
is great, and we hope to share 
that energy with the parents and 
students.”

This year, the event filled

FOOTBALL
Wolverines to 
finish season 
versus Florida 
in Citrus Bowl

Gators, Wolverines 

played in same 
game in 2008, 
when Michigan 

won, 41-35

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

For the first time since 2013, 

the No. 14 Michigan football 
team will be playing football on 
New Year’s Day.

The Wolverines announced 

Sunday that they will play 
Florida in the Buffalo Wild 
Wings Citrus Bowl at 1 p.m. on 
Jan. 1 in Orlando, Fla., marking 
Michigan’s 44th bowl game all-
time.

The Wolverines (6-2 Big Ten, 

9-3 overall) and Gators last 
played in the Citrus Bowl on 
Jan. 1, 2008, when the game was 
called the Capital One Bowl. 
Michigan won that contest, 

which was Lloyd Carr’s final 
game coaching the Wolverines, 
41-35.

The 
19th-ranked 
Gators 

are coming off a loss in the 
SEC 
Championship 
Game 

to Alabama and boast a 10-3 
record.

Michigan, 
meanwhile, 
is 

coming off a loss of its own to 
Ohio State. Fifth-year senior 
quarterback Jake Rudock left 
that game after being sacked by 
the Buckeyes’ Joey Bosa, and 
his status is unclear against the 
Gators.

Florida was undefeated until 

mid-October, when quarterback 
Will Grier tested positive for a 
banned substance. The Gators 
dropped their next game to 
LSU, 35-28, but did not lose 
again until the final week of the 
regular season, when Florida 
State beat them 27-2. 

On paper, the Gators’ offense 

looks like a favorable matchup 
for Michigan, which is 7-5 
all-time against SEC teams in 
during bowl season.

Students volunteer 
at ‘One Stop Shop’ 
event for Redford, 
Brightmoor areas

Daily Staff Reporter

DETROIT — Seventy percent 

of the people who reside in 
Brightmoor, a neighborhood on 

Detroit’s far west side, live below 
the poverty line, according to 
Karen Plants, executive director 
of 
the 
Redford 
Brightmoor 

Initiative. 
Saturday 
marked 

the 13th annual One Stop 
Shop, a charity event in which 
appliances, 
winter 
clothing, 

food and toys are distributed 
to residents who reside in 
Brightmoor and neighboring 
Redford.

This 
year, 
the 
Detroit 

Partnership, 
a 
University 

student group, helped distribute 
donations to more than 300 
families.

The event was held at the 

Brightmoor 
campus 
of 
the 

Redford 
Aldersgate 
United 

Methodist Church. The drive 
was 
organized 
much 
like

When you look up Stone Tem-

similar artists, you’ll see Pearl 
Jam, Alice in Chains, Sound-

Alice in Chains, the flair of Aero-

the influence of the Stones, the 
political charge of Pearl Jam and 
the range of Soundgarden. And 
because their sound is so deriva-
tive of all of these other bands, 
STP are incredibly easy to mock, 
write off and forget.

STP hasn’t aged well, and its 

music lies perpetually stuck in 
the early ’90s. Their songs are

15 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK (DEC. 14, 2000)

Judge upholds admissions policy

DINO DIGS

U.S. District Judge Patrick 

Duggan ruled that the Uni-
versity’s policy of using race as 
a contributing factor in under-
graduate admissions was con-
stitutional.

The lawsuit upheld the 

use of affirmative action, 
but made the grid system of 
admissions — in which an 
applicant’s grades and test 
scores were plotted on a graph 
and are assigned a number 
denoted whether they should 
be admitted or not — uncon-
stitutional. That’s because 
a minority student with the 
same grid scores as a white 
student could make the cut 
due solely to race.

The 
grid 
system 
had 

already been replaced in 1998 

in favor of a point selection 
index. The selection index 
system awarded applicants 
points based on a variety of 
criteria, including race. When 
a student earned more points, 
their chances of admissions 
increased.

The case was brought 

before the court by the Cen-
ter for Individual Rights on 
behalf of Jennifer Gratz, a 
white in-state undergradu-
ate applicant who was denied 
admission to the University.

“In regards to the plaintiffs, 

it’s a total victory. In regards 
to the case, it’s a partial vic-
tory,” Curt Levy, CIR director 
of legal and public affairs, said 
after the ruling.

Then-University 
Provost 

Nancy Cantor called the rul-
ing “an unequivocal victory 
for (the University).” 

The case, Gratz v. Bollinger, 

was eventually appealed to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. In 
a controversial 6-3 ruling in 
2003, the court decided that 
the point selection index sys-
tem’s automatic awarding of 
20 extra points to underrep-
resented minority applicants 
was unconstitutional. In a 
separate case, the court ruled 
the University Law School’s 
narrow use of race as one of 
many factors in selecting a 
class of students. But by 2006, 
Michigan residents voted to 
ban the use of affirmative 
action in admissions.

PICKING OUT POTS

Guest speaker discusses 
Arab, Zionist identities

Egyptian activist, 
imprisoned during 
Arab Spring, talks 

Israel advocacy

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

About 30 students gathered 

in the Trotter Multicultural 
Center on Sunday to hear from 
Hussein 
Aboubakr 
Mansour, 

an Arab Zionist who discussed 
his experience living in Egypt 
during the Arab Spring.

Mansour, now an assistant 

professor of Hebrew Studies at 
the Defense Language Institute 
Foreign Language Institute in 
Monterey, Calif., delivered a 
talk titled “Surviving Tahrir 
Square: An Egyptian’s Story 
of 
the 
Revolution.” 
Though 

Mansour’s remarks touched on 
his imprisonment during the 

Arab Spring, a large portion of 
his speech was also dedicated 
to advocating for Zionism — 
broadly defined as a movement 
supporting the existence of a 
Jewish state — and condemning 
radical Muslim movements.

Mansour was born into an 

Arab Muslim family. He said, as 
a Zionist, he has very different 
political views from the majority 
of those who identify as Muslims. 
He 
said 
he 
felt 
constantly 

threatened 
while 
living 
in 

Egypt, due to the conflicting 
nature of his Arab Muslim and 
Zionist identities. During the 
Egyptian Revolution, Mansour 
said he was imprisoned for his 
pro-Israel views. He sought 
asylum in the United States in 
2012, where he now resides.

“I started to learn Hebrew and 

learn about the Jewish people 
and their history,” he said. 
“For the first time, I started to 
expose myself to resources and 

historical sources way different 
than the sources I had been 
exposed to as a child. And these 
stories made much more sense 
than the ones I had heard about 
Jews being a ‘super-villain.’ The 
first time I heard the definition 
of anti-Semitism, I immediately 
recognized it because it was 
everywhere around me. I read 
for the first time about Jews 
not as Zionist soldier pigs, but 
as mothers and fathers. These 
stories made much more sense 
and explained reality better.”

Mansour 
repeatedly 

emphasized 
the 
importance 

of 
discussion 
and 
education 

about Israeli causes on college 
campuses. He specifically called 
out the Boycott, Divest and 
Sanctions movement as anti-
Semitic.

“I wish that things like BDS 

can be called out for what they 
are, which is bigotry,” Mansour 
said. “And American campuses, 
because of their diversity, should 
be the places where this dialogue 
starts.”

The 
divestment 
movement, 

set in motion on the University’s 
campus 
by 
the 
organization 

Students Allied for Freedom and 
Equality, has gained widespread 
attention in the last two years, 
particularly as resolutions — 
which would have called on 
the University to divest from 
companies that some say facilitate 
human rights violations in Israel 
— were proposed in Central 
Student Government.

Mansour said though many 

American Muslims as moderate, 
he 
wants 
to 
see 
American 

Muslims take more responsibility 
for those who subscribe to more 
radical interpretations of Islam, 
particularly in light of the recent 
shooting in San Bernardino — 
the Dec. 2 attack in which two 
shooters who were potentially 
inspired by ISIS killed 14 people 
during an employee holiday party.

“What we think important, both on campus and nationally, 
is that whatever the terrorist threat ISIS poses, it can never 

justify discrimination against Muslim Americans.”

with HIV,” Griggs said. “This 
event’s purpose and its mission 
are to destigmatize those nega-
tive perceptions.”

As a result, Kwapo said, the 

event was meant to provide a 
constructive forum where stu-
dents could be exposed to others’ 
nuanced, firsthand experiences 
with HIV.

“We want it to be a learning 

experience, and we really aim 
for students to know actual facts 
about the disease and to not look 
at someone who’s HIV positive 
and just assume the worst of 
them,” she said.

Among these speakers was 

Leon Golson, the director of 
prevention programs at Unified 
— an organization formed with 
the merger of AIDS Partnership 
Michigan and the state’s HIV/
AIDS Resource Center.

According to a press release, 

Unified serves 10 counties in 
Southeast Michigan where 63 

percent of Michigan residents 
living with HIV reside.”

Golson, who is afflicted with 

HIV, shared his experiences 
with the diagnosis, and provided 
tips for preventing the spread of 
HIV.

“That’s what I have in my 

body right now, HIV, slowly but 
surely trying to chip away from 
my immune system,” he said. “A 
healthy T-cell count runs any-
where from about 800 to 1,200. 
My T-cell count is holding steady 
between 700 to 800, so far so 
good.”

Golson said while most people 

know that wearing a condom or 
abstaining from sex can prevent 
HIV, diagnoses are still wide-
spread, despite this knowledge.

“Why is it that about a month 

ago we had to diagnose a young 
person?” he said. “This young 
man was 24 years old and we’ve 
been studying this for 30 years. 
He knew the answer to (how to 
prevent HIV), so what is going 
on? There’s a lot more to it than 
just using condoms. There’s a lot 
more to it than just saying no and 

it’s those issues that we need to 
talk about. Being HIV positive 
does not take place in a specific 
vacuum.”

Golson encouraged students to 

share information they learned 
from his presentation with their 
friends, and with as many others 
as possible.

“One of my take-home mes-

sages for this group is, first of 
all, please share this informa-
tion with the folks that aren’t 
here,” he said. “This auditorium 
should be filled to capacity, but it 
just reflects where people are in 
regards to this issue.”

Kwapo was also a speaker at 

the event, sharing anecdotes 
from a trip she took to Ghana. 
While there, Kwapo said, she was 
surprised by how little the dis-
ease was talked about given that 
HIV has significantly impacted 
the country.

“What I want people to get 

from this event is that it’s OK to 
talk about it,” she said. “We talk 
about things like cancer all the 
time, so why is this disease such 
a horrible thing to even men-

tion?”

Griggs said the event’s mono-

logue format conveys the disease 
from a more personal, human 
source 
and, 
therefore, 
was 

intended to be more compelling 
than a normal lecture might be.

“We definitely wanted to take 

a different approach through cre-
ative expression, to make people 
more comfortable and also to tell 
a story,” she said. “We hope that 
people enjoy these monologues, 
but that they also learn a lot and 
then teach it to their friends and 
whatever community that they 
belong to.”

LSA junior Kennedy Clark said 

she thought the performance 
touched on issues relevant to the 
campus community.

“I feel like we still think of 

AIDS and HIV as something 
that’s part of the past rather 
than 
something 
that’s 
still 

an issue, despite its history,” 
she said. “It’s important, just 
because of the fact that we’re 
risky individuals and we’re in 
college, and I just think it’s a 
good time and place.”

LSA junior Merin Paul attend-

ed the event in preparation for 
an Alternative Spring Break trip 
focused on HIV and AIDS.

“The reason a lot of people 

don’t know about it is because 
there’s such a stigma attached to 
the whole issue,” she said. “The 
stigma is not knowing how you 
can be protected, how can you 
prevent the disease and how 
you can live with HIV success-
fully for a long time. So much 
has changed since when people 
didn’t know how to treat it and 
people just spread awareness and 
learn more about it.”

Paul said it was important for 

college students to attend the 
event in order to put HIV-posi-
tive individuals and their experi-
ences into perspective.

“You’re meeting so many peo-

ple in college every single day,” 
she said. “You don’t know their 
backgrounds, but having HIV 
doesn’t mean you can’t be friends 
with someone or can’t interact 
with someone. I think that’s 
something that everyone should 
understand and accept.”

Study finds online 
classes appeal to 
affluent students 

John D. Hansen, a Ph.D. 

candidate at Harvard University’s 
School of Education, found that 
free online courses may not be 
increasing access to education as 
much as some may have believed, 
according to the New York Times.

In a study, Hansen and his col-

leagues analyzed registration and 
completion patterns in 
massive open online courses at 
Harvard and M.I.T. They 
determined that those living in 
affluent neighborhoods were 
more likely to register and 
complete these courses.

Hansen said despite these find-

ings, most students enrolled in 
online courses are not very afflu-
ent, and that courses could be bet-
ter designed so that lower-income 
students would find them more 
appealing and 
accessible.

Report finds 
widening racial gap 
in graduation rates

The Education Trust released 

a report Wednesday that found, 
though graduation rates are 
increasing for minority students 
at several public universities, they 
are not growing as fast as the rate 
for white students at any time in 
the 21st century.

The racial graduation rate gap 

at public schools in the study was 
large: For white students, it was 
64.2 percent, and for minorities, it 
was 50.1 percent, according to the 
Washington Post.

Andrew H. Nicholas, a co-

author of the report, said these 
racial gaps should be included in 
the current dialogue about race 
that has been prevalent on college 
campuses.

Obama vows to 
defeat ISIL in Oval 
Office Address 

In the wake of what he called 

the largest terror attack in 
the United States since 9/11, 
President Obama addressed the 
nation from the Oval Office to 
calm the American public and 
promulgate his administration’s 
strategy to quell extremism and 
related threats.

This was the third time the 

president delivered an address 
from the Oval Office during his 
two terms in office.

Obama said the recent assault 

in San Bernardino, Calif., was 
an act of terrorism that was 
inspired, but not expressly 
directed, by ISIL.

In the address, the president 

urged Americans not to turn 
to discrimination in times of 
fear. He also asked American 
Muslims to openly reject 
extremism, reaffirming a point 
he has often made that the 
Islamic faith and the extremism 
touted by groups like ISIL and 
Al Qaeda are anomalies.

registration launch, drawing 
students from several local 
middle schools, the Boy Scouts 
and a student electronics club 
from Midland, Mich.

Engineering junior Miranda 

Peterson said she decided to 
volunteer for Saturday’s event 
because she thought she would 
have enjoyed it as a child.

“When I was a kid, I would 

have loved to have a day like 
this — a day to hang out with 
college kids and see what 

they get to do and learn about 
engineering,” she said. “For 
me, I would have just loved to 
do this, so since I’m in a spot 
where I can help out, I took that 
opportunity.”

Engineering senior Kathryn 

Shepherd 
said 
volunteering 

provided an opportunity to 
expose 
young 
students 
to 

aerospace engineering.

“It’s been really fun,” she 

said. “It’s really cool to give the 
kids the hands-on experience 
working with engineering and 
kind of push them toward (the) 
aerospace route because not a 
lot of kids do that.”

no criteria for admission.

After families waited in the 

pews until their appointment 
time, no area of the church was 
off 
limits. 
Appliances 
were 

being distributed in a room 
across from the chapel, and 
volunteers served a free meal in 
the kitchens housed beneath the 
church. Personal shoppers acted 
as guides to families shopping, 
serving lemonade and cookies to 
those in line.

One shopper in attendance, 

who asked to not be named, said 
she was using One Stop Shop 
for the second time. After losing 
her job last year, she said the 
event helped eased the financial 
burden of buying her grandkids 
gifts for the holiday.

LSA senior Danielle Wallick, 

major 
events 
director 
for 

The 
Detroit 
Partnership, 

said it was her second time 
working at One Stop Shop, 
and noted this was the first 
year organizers implemented 
timed appointments to ease the 
shopping process.

“Last year people would just 

start lining up at 6 a.m. or earlier 
and that’s how it’s been for like 
the past 10 years,” she said.

Wallick added that, though 

people can sign up for an 
appointment time the day of the 
event, most appointments were 
made a month prior.

Beside collecting food and 

clothing on campus, The Detroit 
Partnership launched an online 
campaign to help fund the 
purchase of appliances and toys 
for One Stop Shop.

“Last year we raised almost 

$2,500,” Wallick said. “This year, 

I was completely shocked and 
amazed when I saw that we had 
raised over $4,200.”

The 
Redford 
Brightmoor 

Initiative, which organizes the 
event each year, is a nonprofit 
sponsored 
by 
the 
Redford 

Aldersgate 
United 
Methodist 

Church. Additional funding for 
One Stop Shop comes from Eagles 
for Children, a nonprofit that 
partners with area country clubs 
to raise money for disadvantaged 
children. 
Often, 
the 
money 

from Eagles for Children goes 
specifically 
toward 
acquiring 

toys for One Stop Shop. This 
year, Plants said she made sure 
the event also put an emphasis on 
the collection of children’s coats 
and boots.

“Every time a member shoots 

an eagle, which is a golf term, 
every member chips in two 
dollars,” Plants said. “We had 
a grant from in the past to buy 
toys, but this year we expanded 
it to coats and boots, which I 
just think is really needed in this 
neighborhood.”

Reverend Jonathan Combs 

has been with the parish since 
July, and helped facilitate the 
event. Though he has only been 
with the community a short 
time, he said he has gained an 
understanding of the unique 
challenges of a poor urban 
neighborhood.

“We’re a poor neighborhood, 

but not poor in spirit,” said 
Combs.

The church’s former reverend, 

Courtney Williams, created the 
Brightmoor Free Store last year 
— a program inspired by the 
One Stop Shop — which offers 
clothing and food to community 
members every Saturday from 10 
a.m. until 1 p.m.

“Folks come not only to 

get free stuff, but they come for 
community, to be a part of friends 
in the neighborhood,” Comb said. 
“And we’re all neighbors.”

Plants 
said 
Brightmoor’s 

church community is one that 
takes care of its own.

“Half the volunteers here 

today are from the neighborhood, 
and I have a faithful core of 
volunteers that are here every 
week,” Plants said. “Whatever 
needs to be done, they show up. 
They feel it’s important to give 
back for the blessings they’ve 
received.”

Plants added that she was 

afraid there would not be 
enough donated items to serve 
the community’s demands, but 
said the people who care about 
this community — University 
students included — had come 
through incredibly. She said 
University students came out 
to volunteer both the night 
before and the day of the 
event.

Public 
Policy 
senior 

Kristy Landis is a member 
of The Detroit Partnership’s 
executive board. Throughout 
the year, Landis said, the 
partnership 
volunteers 

with programs for Detroit 
communities, 
schools 
and 

sports 
teams. 
There 
are 

eight or nine programs in 
Brightmoor which run once a 
week during the school year.

“Brightmoor is a pretty 

small community in Detroit, 
but it’s one of the most 
blighted,” Landis said. “It’s a 
really important way to make 
sure that so many members of 
the community have a better 
holiday.”

While community service 

is important, Landis said it’s 
important that volunteers are 
mindful 
of 
the 
implications 

of entering a community like 
Brightmoor for just one day, as 
opposed to a more long-term 
immersion in the neighborhood.

“The need for that area and 

the concerns they have are very 
different than mine living in Ann 
Arbor,” she said. “I think it’s very 
important for people to see that 
firsthand.”

Wallick said she was glad 

The Detroit Partnership gets 
to be a part of this event, but 
cautioned against overstating 
the University’s involvement.

“It’s the community that’s 

running it, we’re just here to 
service-learn, which is part 
of 
our 
mission 
statement,” 

Wallick said. “ I don’t think that 
it works as well when outside 
people come in and try to do 
their own events and stuff. The 
community has to take the 
lead.”

Student evaluations: 
Treat with caution

Not too long ago, researchers 

at a large Midwestern university 
arranged to have a speaker give the 
same lecture to 154 undergraduates 
enrolled in eight sections of a 
required course. Or almost the 
same lecture: One small detail was 
different in half of the sections, 
so let’s call them lecture A and 
lecture B. Afterward, the students 
filled out a “teacher evaluation 
form.” The first part asked about 
the 
teacher’s 
competence 
and 

character, the second one asked 
how 
much 
the 
students 
had 

learned. Part three consisted of four 
 

open-ended questions.

Most students had good things to 

say about either lecture: 97 percent 
of them had some positive comment 
on lecture A, 96 percent on lecture 
B, though lecture A received more 
positive comments than lecture 
B (412 vs. 339). When it came to 
negative 
comments, 
though, 
a 

starkly different picture emerged: 
Just 30 percent of the students had 
critical things to say about lecture 
A, but 79 percent disliked something 
about lecture B. Lecture A received 
a total of 52 negative comments. 
Lecture B, 205 — almost four times 
as many.

So what was the difference? Same 

lecture, same speaker, same class. 
But in lecture A, the male teacher 
referred in passing to “my partner 
Jennifer.” In lecture B, he casually 
mentioned “my partner Jason.” 
The result? Students reported that 
they had learned much less from 
the “gay” teacher than from the 
“straight” teacher: On a 10-point 
scale, the mean for the purportedly 
gay teacher was 5.85; for the 
purportedly 
straight 
one, 
8.51. 

And in response to the question 
of whether the school should hire 
the instructor, an overwhelming 
93 percent of students would have 
“unquestionably” hired his straight 
incarnation. But just 30 percent 
of students said they “might” hire 
the gay one, with a paltry 8 percent 
saying “definitely.”

Would the same shocking picture 

emerge at the University now? I 
sincerely hope not. But we don’t 
know: The University does not 
collect data on our faculty’s sexual 
orientation (thank you, University). 
And even if it did, it would not tell 
you very much: Only controlled, 
randomized studies like the one 
above can give you any reliable 
insight into the effect bias has on 
student evaluations. And we have not 
done such studies at the University. 
If we had, we would have looked at 
gender, race and national origin. Or 
even (though I shudder to think how) 
at “attractiveness” — hot teachers 
(please insert your own scare 
quotes) get better ratings. There’s a 
reason Rate My Professors openly 
(and repugnantly) invites students to 
comment on their professors’ looks.

Of course, none of us believe that 

we are those people who would 
judge a teacher on the basis of his or 
her skin color, ab definition, erotic 
preference or comic timing. But I 
know this: If our more than 40,000 
students (or our thousands of faculty, 
staff and administrators) were free 
of misogyny, racism, homophobia, 
Islamophobia and whatever other 
bias you are worried about (if you 
worry about these things, as I 
believe we should), an army of social 
science researchers would descend 
on our lovely town to study this 
 

unicorn population.

Last month, the Daily published 

a 
well-balanced 
piece 
on 
our 

current collective discussion about 
publicizing 
course 
evaluations. 

Here is one paragraph that caught 
 

my attention:

“(Mika) 
LaVaque-Manty 
said 

based on his research, individual 
bias due to gender and race is 
evident in classrooms, both in open-
ended comments and quantitative 
measurements. However, he also 
stressed that those biases tend 
to disappear from the overall 
quantitative data, except for some 
instances of gender bias appearing 
when data is analyzed at the 
departmental level.”

I have the highest respect for my 

colleague Mika, but I’m not sure 

what to make of this. Bias does not 
“disappear”; it only gets masked. A 
faculty member who receives lower 
rankings because she is Black, or 
gay, or wearing a hijab will not feel 
any better because a cursory look 
at aggregate data paints a rosier 
picture.

But unconscious bias and the 

much rarer instances of open 
bigotry are not the only reasons we 
should think very carefully about 
student evaluations, and even more 
carefully about making them public. 
Study after study confirms that 
the strongest correlation between 
rankings and teaching is a single 
measure: “My expected grade is…” 
This is true at the University, and 
it is particularly true at the polar 
ends: On average, the most lenient 
graders get the highest rankings 
(which doesn’t mean that leniently 
graded classes cannot be fantastic 
for all sorts of reasons), the harshest 
ones get the lowest rankings (and 
again, a strictly graded class could 
of course also be sub-par for any 
number of unrelated reasons). This 
is not surprising: Why would you 
rank highly a professor who just 
messed up your GPA? Why would 
you not think kind thoughts about 
the one who made your life easier? 
And why would you not want to 
know in advance which is which?

According to the research, the 

quickest way to improve your stu-
dent evaluations is to give every-
body an A. Or to cynically game the 
system. One faculty member told 
me, to my horror, “Oh, I grade the 
midterms really leniently and then 
I hit them on the final, after they 
hand in their evals.”

Students have told us that they 

are particularly interested in the 
answers to two questions: “expected 
grade” and “workload.” I get it. It’s 
perfectly legitimate to try and bal-
ance your workload. It’s perfectly 
legitimate to worry about your GPA. 
But it is less clear to me whether we, 
as an institution of higher learning, 
should assist students in finding the 
easiest classes. Worst-case scenario: 
the easier the class, the higher the 
enrollments, to the detriment of the 
difficult, challenging and perhaps 
uncomfortable classes that can lead 
to real intellectual growth. Con-
versely, what about faculty who’d 
prefer to teach smaller classes? Less 
grading, more time for research, 
right? Easy fix: Grade on a C-minus 
curve. If you have a thick skin and 
don’t care much about your pub-
lic profile, your own workload just 
 

got lighter.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m not sug-

gesting that good grades reflect 
problematic teaching or that a harsh 
grader is automatically a more chal-
lenging teacher — far from it. Per-
sonally, I’d be happy to do away with 
grades altogether. I’m also not sug-
gesting that evaluations don’t tell 
you anything worth knowing or that 
I don’t trust the great majority of 
students. To be fair, I have gotten a 
great deal of valuable feedback from 
my own sets (in particular from the 
open comments). As a department 
chair, I do look at evaluations as one 
way to get a sense of how my col-
leagues are doing in the classroom. 
But like all my fellow chairs and like 
everybody I know who is engaged in 
hiring or promotion decisions, I treat 
that information with considerable 
caution, as data that needs to be read 
 

in context. 

That said, I believe strongly that 

students should be able to find out 
more about the classes they are tak-
ing. But student evaluations are just 
a small piece of the puzzle, and not 
a particularly reliable one. In fact, a 
task force at the University recently 
concluded that “in courses (with) 
fewer than 50 students, regardless 
of the response rate, the evaluation 
is close to random.” Since just 18 
percent of our classes enroll more 
than 50 students, that means that in 
82 percent of them, the evaluations 
may tell you next to nothing about 
the quality of the education you are 
likely to receive.

In my personal and entirely unsci-

entific experience, this rings true. I 
got one of my highest ratings ever for 
a class that I know was terrible. Not 

because I don’t generally care about 
teaching, but because my brother 
had just died, and I was consumed by 
grief. So this time around, I did not 
care much about teaching. I didn’t 
care much about my students. I didn’t 
care much about anything at all. I 
graded on auto-pilot. I gave almost 
everybody an A, not because I wanted 
good evaluations but because I didn’t 
want to punish students for what I 
knew was my problem, not theirs. If 
my evaluations had been public, you 
would have learned that most of my 
students “strongly agreed” that they 
had attended an “excellent class” 
by an “excellent teacher.” They did 
not. They had attended a badly pre-
pared and badly taught class by a 
very sad teacher whose thoughts 
 

were elsewhere. 

Is there better information out 

there? Not really — and that’s a sig-
nificant problem that students should 
indeed clamor to see addressed. Here 
is what I believe would help: first, a 
required link to a detailed syllabus 
for each course listing; second, a 
required substantial course descrip-
tion detailing the goals of the class, 
the material to be investigated, the 
balance between lecturing, discus-
sion and engaged learning activities 
and the nature of assessments; and 
lastly, significantly improved aca-
demic advising (my daughter waited 
three months for an appointment 
and only got help after I sent a note 
complaining about the fact that her 
e-mails went unanswered).

All of that would provide infor-

mation much more important than 
access to a set of data that is likely 
quite random, pervaded by bias, 
tied to grade inflation, measuring 
nobody-quite-knows-what and likely 
to create anxiety and even public 
shame in a good number of perfectly 
wonderful faculty members, particu-
larly vulnerable ones, such as lectur-
ers or untenured professors.

I should stress that I am not 

opposed to giving students access 
to these data, in the context of good 
academic advising, as long as every-
body knows what they can and can-
not tell you. But don’t kid yourself: 
Doing so will not improve teaching 
at the University; it actually might do 
 

the opposite.

Instead, we should work togeth-

er to find better ways to assess 
teaching and better ways to share 
information about courses, and, 
perhaps most importantly, to cre-
ate an atmosphere in which we 
treat each other with thought, care 
and respect. Students pay for their 
education, and it’s not cheap, to 
put it mildly. But that doesn’t mean 
that a college class is a consumer 
good like any other. Teachers are 
humans, and to grade them on a 
five-point scale as if they were a 
microwave oven on Amazon in and 
of itself runs the risk of devaluing 
this great shared enterprise that is 
 

the University.

Teaching and learning go togeth-

er. The quality of a class depends 
on the professor; it also depends on 
the students. Remember Question 
3 on our evals: “I learned a great 
deal from this course”? To be sure, 
it is the professor’s responsibility to 
create the conditions under which 
you can learn a great deal. But if you 
are a student, whether you actually 
learn a great deal is also up to you. 
Did you do all the homework? Did 
you attend all the lectures? Did you 
turn off your cellphone during class 
and close out of Facebook? Were 
you curious and engaged? Did you 
treat your teacher — and the very 
act of learning — with respect?

At present, it seems that we will 

thoroughly revise our current ques-
tionnaire and begin to share these 
new evaluation data with students 
beginning in Fall 2016. And to repeat, 
I am fine with that — provided we 
do so carefully and responsibly, tak-
ing into account everything we know 
and everything we know that we 
don’t know, with respect for students 
and teachers alike.

SILKE-MARIA WEINECK | VIEWPOINT

It’s time to divest

DIVEST AND INVEST | VIEWPOINT

 It’s been quite the semester for Divest and 

Invest, the student group campaigning for 
the divestment of the $1 billion the University 
endowment 
has 
invested 
in 
the 
fossil 

fuel industry.

The fight for divestment extends far beyond 

campus, and the movement as a whole is building 
steam. Around the world, over 500 institutions 
have divested $3.4 trillion, and in the past 
10 weeks alone, 100 more pledged to divest, 
according to Fossil Free. Leonardo DiCaprio, 
the University of Massachusetts and Allianz, the 
world’s largest insurance company, are among 
recent divesters. Just this week, Bill Gates and 
other philanthropists announced plans to create 
a groundbreaking renewable energy fund, 
highlighting the other equally important side of 
the Divest and Invest equation.

People the world over consider divestment 

worthwhile, but the campaign at the University 
has met much resistance from the administration. 
At a meeting with Divest students last August, 
University President Mark Schlissel said that our 
$10 billion endowment isn’t a political tool. Not a 
political tool? We at Divest were a little confused 
by that logic, and Naomi Klein, an environmental 
journalist, activist and best-selling author of 
“This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The 
Climate,” agrees.

Klein spoke at Rackham last month, and when 

we asked her how she would respond to our 
administration, she said, “Get on the right side of 
history … Being apolitical in the face of this crisis 
is not one of the options available to us.” Frankly, 
the University’s argument is nothing more than 
an excuse to pursue a path that may seem easier 
but is morally unacceptable. An investment is 
an unquestionable show of support; a politically 
neutral investment is an impossibility.

Just two weeks later, the Senate Assembly 

gave our campaign its stamp of approval, 
voting to endorse a resolution that calls for the 
formation of a committee under the University’s 
Board of Regents committee to investigate 
divestment. This decision echoes that of CSG 
from last year, which voted 32-2 to endorse the 
committee. Taken together, these developments 
have important implications.

Here’s why: For an issue to merit the formation 

of a committee to consider divestment at the 
University, a three-pronged precedent must be 
met. We’ve already covered two prongs, showing 
that the activities of the fossil fuel industry are 
antithetical to the University’s core values and 
that the fossil fuel industry is uniquely responsible 
for the underlying issue of climate change. All that 
remained was proving a consensus on campus 
surrounding the underlying issue — in this case 
anthropogenic climate change — and the CSG 
and Senate Assembly resolutions accomplish 
precisely that. Therefore, we have now used 
every democratic tool at our disposal to push for 
the formation of this ad hoc regents committee. 
How has the administration responded, you may 
ask? With deafening silence.

Silence isn’t particularly conducive to progress, 

so we showed up to the last regents meeting to 
remind the administration that ignoring our 
requests won’t make us, or this issue, disappear. 
Supporters of Divest packed the meeting room, 
applauding loudly as campaigners reminded the 

regents of their duty to form a committee and 
asked them to honor a simple request to meet 
with campaign members, so that Wolverines may 
share the pride of those who have already chosen 
to stand on the right side of history.

Paralleling our work, 195 countries are 

currently meeting at the COP21 conference in 
Paris to discuss the creation of binding climate 
change legislation. This meeting has the potential 
to create a global climate change agreement. The 
beginning of COP21 was met by movements 
in Paris and other parts of the world. These 
activists aim to pressure our world leaders to 
become more sustainable and create legislation 
to curtail the negative effects of climate change, 
and some have personal stakes in the issue, such 
as a poet and climate activist from the Marshall 
Islands who is calling for fossil fuel divestment 
in fear of seeing the beautiful country disappear 
under rising sea levels. Others are simply trying 
to urge public institutions to create policies that 
will mitigate climate change. When it comes to 
climate change activism, the University has not 
been left out.

To show solidarity with those fighting for 

climate justice in Paris, Divest and Invest is 
hosting a Pledge to the Planet Climate Action 
Week. The week coincides with COP21, allowing 
students an opportunity to engage with our 
campaign to create a fossil fuel-free future and 
mitigate climate change. This Action Week kicks 
off this Monday, so stop by the Diag to learn more 
about the events this week, and create your own 
personal pledge to sustainability. Tuesday, we’re 
hosting a panel discussion at 5:30 p.m. in Room 
1040 of the Dana Building, in which climate 
professionals will discuss the implications of 
COP21. Wednesday, there will be a free screening 
of the documentary “Merchants of Doubt” 
at 5 p.m. in the same location. Thursday and 
Friday, we ask students to spread knowledge 
on climate change activism by talking to 
friends and preparing for Saturday’s Michigan 
 

Climate March.

The Michigan Climate March creates an 

opportunity for members of the community to 
send a message to the state of Michigan. Fossil 
fuel use must be curtailed in order to create 
a sustainable society. The dangers of climate 
change are quite real and affect people, even in 
our own state. Taking part in climate activism 
at home allows students to stand in solidarity 
with activists across the world. Together, 
we can create a community that pressures 
world leaders to develop policy that mitigates 
climate change and protects vulnerable 
populations. Furthermore, as leaders meet in 
Paris to discuss a just transition to this clean 
future, we must push for the state of Michigan 
to do the same.

TV REVIEW
‘Very’ not funny

Guest star-heavy 

holiday special could 

use more humor

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Daily Arts Writer

Netflix? Bill Murray? A slew 

of impressive guest stars includ-
ing Amy Poehler, Rashida Jones, 
Michael 
Cera, 

Chris Rock and 
Maya Rudolph? 
Holiday cheer? 
Sounds 
amaz-

ing, right? Not 
quite. The best 
decision direc-
tor Sofia Cop-
pola’s (“Lost In 
Translation”) 
“A Very Mur-
ray Christmas” made was having 
its star pass out drunk — literally 
— after which, Murray awakened, 
flanked by Miley Cyrus and George 
Clooney in a newly imagined, time-
worthy holiday special.

Prior to his unconsciousness, 

Bill Murray was just getting by: The 
opening 75 percent of the program, 
while comprised of an extremely 
talented cast in regards to comedy, 
was a bore. Taking place at New 
York’s Carlyle Hotel, it focused too 
heavily on serenading the audi-
ence with mediocre performances 
of sometimes recognizable, some-
times daydream-inducing show 
tunes and Christmas classics. 
The outliers came unexpectedly 

from Maya Rudolph’s old-school 
glamour performance of “Baby, 
Please Come Home,” complete 
with a cocktail waitress trio 
for backup and Jenny Lewis’s 
(remember Rilo Kiley?) half of 
“Baby, It’s Cold Outside.” Mur-
ray spoke the other half of the 
song, opting to focus his banter 
toward the special’s plot rather 
than the original lyrics — the 
only instance in the show’s first 
act when music would have 
been the better than comedy.

When the music wasn’t good, 

it was bad, and when it was nei-
ther, the dialogue invited the 
type of laugh where there’s no 
laughing involved (it’s more 
of a harsh exhale through the 
nose accompanied by a quar-
ter of a smile.) Poehler’s best 
moment was when she walked 
into Murray’s hotel room in the 
first scene holding what looked 
like a Christmas bell, but it was 
only to be two mini bottles of 
whiskey. Michael Cera was 
great in his Michael-Cera-play-
ing-Michael-Cera-playing-a-
character kind of way. But, 45 
minutes in, Rudolph, Jones and 
Rock’s comedic touches went 
untapped.

Just when it was looking like 

2015 would be a miracle-free 
Christmas, Bill Murray fell off 
the seat of the piano bench during 
the ensemble’s final carol, and the 
Christmas special of his (and our) 
dreams ensued — a winter won-
derland featuring a white piano, 
kick lines of scantily dressed 

reindeer and a Bill Murray who 
doesn’t 
resemble 
his 
“Zom-

bieland” equivalent as closely.

As Murray found his musical 

footing and his fatherly (now bor-
dering on grandfatherly) charm 
in the first verse of “Sleigh Ride,” 
Miley Cyrus and George Clooney 
slid in on a white sled to bring 
some desperately needed magic. 
Clooney poured martinis on the 
piano as Cyrus steps in on vocals 
and finished out the tune along-
side Murray with holiday spirit 
sparkling from their eyes as they 
dance. 

As the song ended, fear sets in 

that Murray could awaken into 
the dimly lit, ill-conceived mess 
back at The Carlyle — but no fear, 
the snowball kept rolling as Cyrus 
delivered a solo performance of 
“Silent Night” that left no ques-
tions about her vocal talent. She 
lulled through lines appropriately 
while belting others, filling the 
“sound stage in Queens” as Cloo-
ney described it. Next up was the 
rather creepy “Santa Claus Wants 
Some Lovin.” Its entertainment 
didn’t root from Murray’s itching 
delivery or the performance itself, 
but rather the comedic value of 
Clooney creeping among fake firs 
echoing, “Santa wants some lov-
ing.”

Finally, the trio that saved 

Christmas comes together once 
more for “Let It Snow,” proving 
their status as the ultimate holiday 
entertainment once and for all — 
but we could have already guessed 
that.

TV REVIEW
‘Wiz’ delights 
in live special

By ALEX INTNER

Daily Arts Writer

“The Wiz” follows the well-

known story of “The Wizard of 
Oz,” and this new production 
featured 
the 

classic 
score 

alongside 
an 

updated, sharp 
book by Harvey 
Fierstein (who 
wrote the book 
for the Broad-
way hit “Kinky 
Boots”). Zadan 
and Meron filled the cast with 
many familiar names, each of 
whom brought down the house 
during their ephemeral scenes. 
From Queen Latifah (“Chicago”) 
as The Wiz, to Mary J. Blige 
(“Empire”) as the Wicked Witch 
of the West, Amber Riley (“Glee”) 
as the Good Witch of the North 
and Uzo Aduba (“Orange is the 
New Black”) as the Good Witch 
of the South, each had a show-
stopping number that showcased 
their powerful voices.

However, the standout per-

formance 
was 
by 
newcomer 

Shanise Williams as Dorothy. 
She struggled in the beginning 
to gain momentum in her dia-
logue, but once she became more 
comfortable onstage, a star was 
born. She closed the show with 
the song “Home,” which she sang 
with a comparable strength and 
emotion to some of her more sea-
soned co-stars.

The biggest choice Zadan and 

Meron made from last year was 
switching from a more television-
like set to a proscenium staging 
— a normal stage. This choice 
was likely driven by this produc-
tion’s Broadway aspirations, but 
it ended up enhancing the show’s 
theatricality. Instead of rotating 
between already-built sets, they 
moved on and off the stage with 
projections in the background. 
The sets were physically small-
er, but more intricate with little 
details, especially in the Wiz’s 

chamber and the Wicked Witch’s 
castle. The costumes were more 
complex, as well, and will likely 
result in a Tony nomination for 
designer Paul Tazewell when the 
production moves to Broadway.

The proscenium staging also 

affected the musical numbers, 
with stage director Kenny Leon 
(who won a Tony for the latest 
revival of “A Raisin in the Sun”) 
and choreographer Fatima Rob-
inson (“Dreamgirls”), who used 
the smaller space to create a 
more theatrical broadcast than 
in years past. Robinson’s cho-
reography brought each of the 
numbers to life, painting pictures 
which looked beautiful from 
above. This is especially true in 
the number “Brand New Day,” 
which had high-energy danc-
ing that couldn’t have been easy 
that late in the evening. Cirque 
du Soleil partnered with NBC 
on the broadcast and upcom-
ing Broadway production, and 
their acrobats produced a cer-
tain dynamicism which made 
sequences 
like 
the 
tornado 

impactful.

Still, one of “Peter Pan” ’s big-

gest problems remained prevalent 
in “The Wiz”: the television direc-
tion, this year by Matthew Dia-
mond (“The Oogieloves in the Big 
Balloon Adventure”). The change 
to the proscenium created grand 
and expansive staging, but at times, 
the camera failed to capture them. 
Instead of pulling back and let-
ting the big dance numbers make 
the impact with sheer spectacle, 
they used close-ups and focused 
too much on smaller aspects of the 
big picture. It was confusing, espe-
cially in scenes like the Tornado. It 
seemed like the camera focused on 
Dorothy flying instead of on what 
the dancers on stage were doing.

Despite all of the problems, 

about halfway through “The Wiz,” 
I stopped watching out of an obli-
gation to the musical form and 
started watching because I loved 
what I saw. “The Wiz” proved to me 
that Zadan and Meron know what 
makes a good show, and I can’t wait 
to see what they do next year.

FILM REVIEW
Lacking ‘Krampus’

By BEN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

“Krampus” wants to be both a 

comedy and a horror movie, but 
it can’t quite pull off either. There 
isn’t much in 
the way of sus-
tained 
dread; 

the 
movie 

mostly 
relies 

on a few jump 
scares and a 
couple 
excit-

ing 
monster-

fighting scenes. 
Laughs 
natu-

rally arise from 
the ridiculousness of the animated 
toy enemies, but outside of those 
sequences, the movie is lacking in 
comedy.

The film starts as a heartwarm-

ing family movie. Max (Emjay 
Anthony, “Chef”), a young boy who 
misses the way Christmas used 
to be, runs into trouble when his 
cruel cousins Stevie (newcomer 
Lolo Owen) and Jordan (Queenie 
Samuel, “Nothing Trivial”) read 
his letter to Santa Claus out loud. 
The letter expresses Max’s wish 
that his parents, Tom (Adam Scott, 
“The Overnight”) and Sarah (Toni 
Collette, “United States of Tara”), 
would love each other again. Furi-
ous and disenchanted, Max tears 
apart the letter, triggering a mas-
sive 
supernatural 
snowstorm 

focused on their neighborhood.

In the early goings, “Kram-

pus” relies on its compelling cast 
to entertain. Scott is always great 
as the straight man, and Anthony 
is a likable child actor, but other 
characters fall into stereotypical 
roles. Sarah is the naggy, passive-
aggressive wife, rolling her eyes at 
her sister Linda (Allison Tolman, 
“Fargo”), 
brother-in-law 
How-

ard (David Koechner, “Another 
Period”) and aunt Dorothy (Con-
chata Ferrell, “Two and a Half 
Men”). Howard resembles the 
same obnoxious-but-funny char-
acter Koechner always plays, like 
Todd Packer in “The Office,” and 
Dorothy, the sassy old grandma, 
gulps down peppermint schnapps. 
Sarah’s relationship with Linda is 
sweet in the few scenes when they 
interact, but it is never developed.

The main problem is that, like 

2015’s earlier horror movie “The 
Visit,” “Krampus” takes way too 
long to get going. Nothing super-
natural happens for quite a while, 
so there’s a sense that we’re all 
delaying the inevitable with this 
bland holiday dinner. Eventually, 
the power goes out and Max’s sis-
ter Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen, 
“The Carrie Diaries”) goes missing 
in the snowstorm, finally introduc-
ing some horror. Still, the movie 
continues to wait to play its cards, 
showing us boring, slightly come-
dic scenes of waiting and coping 
with the power outage, instead of 
the exciting horror it seems to fore-
shadow.

Visually, at least, the film 

is strong. Writer and direc-

tor Michael Dougherty (“Trick 
‘r Treat”) includes a beautiful 
stop-motion scene as Tom’s Ger-
man mother Omi (Krista Stadler, 
“Lena Rais”) tells the story of 
Krampus, the ancient demon who 
killed Omi’s own parents after she 
lost her love of Christmas. The 
effects, too, are great, perfect for 
the campy horror vibe Dough-
erty wants to create. As the action 
scenes finally begin, the family 
fights off animated gingerbread 
men and murderous jack-in-the-
boxes. None of it is particularly 
scary, but it’s funny, at least, and 
fun. Krampus himself, too, is 
appropriately disturbing, partly 
because his toy minions take up 
most of the action and leave him a 
threatening hidden entity.

Still, by the time things do start 

happening, the emotional invest-
ment is low because the movie has 
lagged to the point of indifference. 
“Krampus” entertains whenever 
it releases the monsters and lets 
chaos take over, but it remains 
restrained throughout most of its 
run time, even down to the ambig-
uous ending. When it comes to the 
horror-comedy genre, it’s essen-
tial not to hold anything back.

are approaching their mid-40s, 
desperately trying to cling to a 
bygone era of stadium fuzz and 
shredded vocal cords. It wasn’t 
cool to like STP back then, but it 
was at least justifiable. No one 
could deny the big dumb great-
ness of “Interstate Love Song,” 
the plow of “Vaseline” or the sta-
dium-sized hook of “Plush.”

I have a few STP songs on my 

iPod, even if it’s roughly equiva-
lent to having a Nickelback song 
or two (which I may or may not 
be guilty of — every band, no mat-
ter how awful, has one song — 
(except Creed). That ’90s grunge 
era produced some of my favor-
ite music, and those aforemen-
tioned STP songs naturally belong 
there. I owe the band at least the 
acknowledgement that it pro-
duced some perfectly acceptable 
grunge-tinged rock tunes wor-
thy of being belted out in my best 
’90s rocker impression as I speed 
down the freeway.

The death of former STP front-

man Scott Weiland last week from 
what was likely a cocaine over-
dose has probably brought the 
band its most cultural relevance 
in 15 or 20 years. I imagine their 
first two albums, Core and Purple, 
will experience a brief but modest 
rise in sales as people pay their 
respects to a fallen rocker. And 
next week, they will remember 
that it isn’t cool to like the Stone 
Temple Pilots, and the band and 

its legacy will drift back into 
obscurity and mediocrity.

But we should not forget STP, 

or at the very least we should not 
forget Weiland. I won’t try to say 
he’s a great vocalist or try to turn 
you on to his music, but I would 
like to remind you that Weiland 
was a textbook junkie rock star. 
His death is not the least bit 
unexpected, and I’m surprised 
he made it all the way to 48.

The older Weiland’s death 

lacks the shock value of the uni-
versally loved Kurt Cobain’s sui-
cide. It lacks the prescience of 
Layne Staley’s demise as he with-
ered away from heroin. He wasn’t 
dazzling like Amy Winehouse or 
influential like Buddy Holly. He’s 
just another rocker that burned 
out and faded away concurrently.

It has become incredibly easy 

to glamourize the deaths of musi-
cians. Their music expresses 
their pain and their struggle, 
and so an early death is the most 
logical, and in a twisted way, 
most desirable capstone to their 
careers — an unlikely demise 
cements the mythic quality of 

these tragic artists. Maybe we’re 
sick like that, demanding our 
heroes to tap into emotions too 
strong for us, the general public, 
to endure, and the result is self-
sacrifice.

But Weiland’s death will not 

be glamourized. He wasn’t pop-
ular enough or young enough 
or tragic enough. We will not 
remember him for his death, and 
we will probably remember him 
only fleetingly for his life and his 
music. This is what it looks like 
when we remove the beer gog-
gles: the deaths of rock stars are 
ugly, minimalist, unsurprising.

Take a listen to STP’s song 

“Creep.” Weiland’s voice sounds 
like Cobain’s. And the refrain: 
“I’m half the man I used to be / 
This feeling as the dawn it fades 
to gray.” Read that as you will, 
but it sounds like addiction and 
heroin.

Weiland gave an interview 

to Esquire in 2005 where he 
recounts the long struggle with 
addiction. He ends it by describ-
ing how the love of his family got 
him through it, how he doesn’t 
think about drugs anymore. Ten 
years later, he’s found dead of 
cardiac arrest on a tour bus with 
cocaine in his room.

Addiction is, in many ways, 

endemic to rock stardom. It’s 
time we shed the glamour. We 
owe Scott Weiland at least that 
much.

STYLE NOTEBOOK

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

People love to hate Coldplay. 

Maybe it’s lead singer Chris Mar-
tin’s inimitable voice, which does 
in fact sound 
like he has a 
head cold. Or 
maybe it’s the 
profuse 
radio 

time the band’s 
(debatably) 
worst 
songs 

are allotted — 
you 
couldn’t 

go anywhere in 
2008 without 
hearing Martin weep “I used to 
rule the world” in the smash “Viva 
La Vida.” The same goes for those 
beat-your-head-against-a-wall 
piano riffs from 2002’s “Clocks.” 
It’s not Coldplay’s best work, and 
it leaves us all wondering: Does 
Britain really have talent?

Those that love to hate Cold-

play, though, should be encour-
aged to delve further into the 
band’s discography. The quartet 
only started to get “dodgy” when 
2011’s Mylo Xyloto rolled around 
— prior albums (i.e. their debut, 
Parachutes) supply truly emotion-
al and experimental tunes. Songs 
like “Yellow” and “Trouble” and 
“Shiver” took the ballad arche-
type and spun it around on its 
head, changing the shape of what 
a new-millennial slow jam could 
sound like for good. So whether 
or not you think Coldplay is abys-
mally vanilla, it can’t be denied 
that the band’s history is solid.

On their latest release, A Head 

Full of Dreams, the Brits are 
reaching with every last limb to 
pull themselves out of history and 
into the now. They strive for color, 
and they aim for flavor, funkiness 
and relevancy. Sometimes they 
get there; sometimes they don’t. 
Regardless, A Head Full of Dreams 
is a complete thought — capped 

off with a certain energetic charm 
that shows itself marvelously on 
some ditties, though, lamentably, 
not on all.

The titular track, “A Head Full 

of Dreams,” opens the quasi-
psychedelic album with tropical 
drumbeats and jungle synths. It’s 
like U2 took a trip to Jamaica — 
the isolated guitars sound like 
classic Edge, but the intrinsic 
bumping rhythm of the song tells 
its listeners to move their British 
booties. “Adventure of a Lifetime” 
rivals “A Head Full of Dreams” 
on the funkiness scale, but isn’t 
nearly as sleek. A snicker escaped 
me as “Adventure” commenced: 
“Turn your magic on!” OK, Cold-
play. I’m on it.

Because the band isn’t groovy 

by nature, too often the explor-
atory tunes of the album fall 
into milquetoast MGMT ter-
ritory — not a sexy place to be. 
“Kaleidoscope” is like an actual 
kaleidoscope in that it’s a mess, 
an 
incoherent 
conglomeration 

of spoken word lyrics and banal 
melodic lines wrapped up in a 
package of “pretty” colors (aka, 
fancy production). “Fun” with 
Tove Lo is not fun at all, and Mar-
tin overpowers her on the har-
monies to the point where Lo is 
stripped of the smoky vocal zest 
that makes her, her — it could be 
anyone singing back-up with the 
human head cold, Martin, on this 
one.

Beyoncé sashays into the mix 

on “Hymn For the Weekend” 
and emits her undeniable grace 
— she improves every tune, even 
this one. It, once again, is sealed 
with flawless production value 
and turns out to be really catchy. 
Though Beyoncé’s super-powers 
are substantially underutilized 
(she hums a lot), “Hymn” has the 
potential to be another radio hit 
for the band. Equally carefree 
is “Birds,” which sounds eerily 
similar to The Cure’s 1985 hit 
“Close to Me.” But “Birds” is chip-
per, earthy with an apt amount of 
restrained psychedelia. Vanilla, in 
this case, is good.

When all is said and done, we 

get back to the ballads — the 
songs that made Coldplay what 
it is. “Everglow” has been the 
most 
aggressively 
promoted 

of them all, with its nursery-
rhyme simplicity and peaceful 
resolutions. It’s more pleasant 
on the ears than, say, “Army 
of One,” which resurrects the 
ne’er-missed spirit of Mike 
Posner. (No pseudo-hip hop, 
please.) “Amazing Day” is a cool 
waltz that builds on symphonic 
energy, strings and all. At first lis-
ten, it could almost be mistaken 
for Parachutes-era Martin and the 
gang.

“Up&Up” pulls us out of the 

Amazonian abyss and into the 
stadium: a culmination of the 
album’s 
consistently 
inspir-

ing tone, “Up&Up” works. This 
one’s a wave-your-lighter and 
kiss-your-lover type of song, the

A case for new capes

By MARIAM SHEIKH

Daily Style Editor

An accessory once associ-

ated with the likes of comic book 
superheroes, the cape is the new 
trend among every it-person in 
fashion this season, both men 
and women alike. While for some 
it may be a bit too cold to get 
away with wearing one right now 
in Ann Arbor, for others brave 
enough to try, a cape never fails 
to take an outfit to the next level. 
Seriously, just Google it, they are 
amazing.

Sleek, comfortable and tai-

lored to perfection, capes are 
the perfect transition piece from 
morning to evening, class to din-
ner, streets to runway. Coming 
in an array of styles, both long 
and short, they can also be tran-
sitional in season. Personally, I 
tend to prefer the shorter ver-
sions of the cape, they are more 
clean-cut and don’t completely 
overwhelm the rest of the outfit. 
However, if you’re taller than me 
(which you most definitely are) 
and feel you can pull it off, the 
longer, fuller capes may be just 
for you. Go crazy, even get one 
with a hood, don’t worry its not 
as grim reaper/dementor as you 
would think. Let’s face it: goth 
is the new haute couture all over 
the world right now.

In terms of color, anyone who 

knows me will immediately call 
out my bias in saying I tend to 
favor the darker and more neu-
tral colors. However, a pop of 
color during the gray winter 
months could actually go a long 
way this season, especially in 
Ann Arbor right now.

Now for material and pattern 

of your soon-to-be new cape, 
this can either make or break 
your attempts at this trend, if I 
am being honest. From leather, 
to cashmere, stripes to plaid, due 
to the overwhelming popular-
ity and versatility capes have, 
they are basically available in 
any shape or form you desire. But 
keep in mind: heavier and stiffer 
materials tend to work best. This 
ensures the cape in line with the 
idea of structure and impeccable 
tailoring I mentioned earlier. 
Think of a cape as a quick-fix style 
staple meant to make you look 
more put-together, the fit is key. 
Anything too loose and baggy 
will simply make your cape look 
like a an oversized poncho, and 
while I will admit those seem to 
be making a comeback as well, if 
you are going for the effect given 
by a high-fashion cape, it is vastly 
different than the one created by 
a frumpy girl-next-door looking 
poncho.

I will say, and don’t say I didn’t 

warn you, there seems to be a bit 
of confusion among retailers and 
bloggers, alike, on this matter. 
There is a difference between a 
wrap and a cape, yet people use 
them and stores tag them inter-
changeably. Both accomplish the 
same job, but wraps tend to be 
more difficult to play around with 
since there is no enclosure. Being 
that you simply wrap it around 
your body, there’s less functional-
ity with it. Whereas with a cape, 
that often has armholes, buttons 
and a collar, it’s akin to wearing 
a light jacket, but with more arm 
mobility. For people thinking 
about trying either of these trends 
while at Michigan, the cape is 
much more forgiving to a huge 
backpack.

What I love about the cape 

trend even further is the fact that 
it is pretty androgynous. Don’t 
get me wrong, there are definite-
ly styles tailored specifically for 
women, but there are options that 
are just as popular with men as 
well. Giving off less of the classic 
superhero vibe and more of a Le 
Marais Parisian shopping district 
vibe. It’s clearly a very high fash-
ion inspired trend, yet it’s easily 
accessible for the everyday man, 
woman, student, you get the gist.

So I present to you the cape. 

It’s 2015; you don’t need to be a 
superhero to wear one.

FILM NOTEBOOK
Merits of trashy art

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

“Dirty Dancing” is my favor-

ite movie. Ever. Last semester, 
while scrolling through photos of 
friends’ adventures abroad, work-
ing through a fresh breakup, bal-
ancing five classes and hiding away 
from the subzero temperatures, 
I shamelessly watched it almost 
every week. I probably have most 
of it memorized by now, but still get 
a thrill whenever I see the opening 
credits start to scroll and hear the 
music kick in. It doesn’t matter that 
the plot is cheesy and the acting 
overdramatic — I love it, and don’t 
really feel guilty about that. But, I 
still know it’s seen as a “guilty-plea-
sure” movie, and I still feel some 
need to justify myself whenever 
people ask about my favorite films.

The concept of a “guilty plea-

sure” comes up a lot when deciding 
what to watch on a Friday night or 
realizing you actually want to go 
see the latest rom-com at the the-
ater. Choosing to watch something 
tacky or simple seems to require 
a disclaimer, an “I’m not as dumb 
as this makes me seem” tag. But 
why should it? What does how we 
relax and find entertaining have 
to do with feeling guilty? As a film 
and English major at a large uni-

versity, there’s an implicit pres-
sure to sound smart and cultured 
when asked in class icebreakers 
or discussions to list off favorite 
movies, TV shows and books. We 
are meant to impress our profes-
sors and classmates with the level 
of intellectualism we require from 
our free-time media, and establish 
ourselves as serious and smart for 
all to see. 

But when actually sitting down 

to watch a movie or TV show, the 
decision of what we choose to 
put on versus what we profess is 
best may not line up exactly. Let’s 
look at statistics of who watches 
“The Bachelor/Bachelorette,” one 
of the seemingly tackiest reality 
shows on TV — overdramatized 
and unrealistic but wholly enter-
taining nonetheless. According to 
The New York Times, the Mon-
day night special regularly pulls 
in millions of viewers, the major-
ity of them women 18 to 49 years 
old. It is especially popular among 
those from upscale, well-educated 
homes, ranking 34 percent more 
popular than other programs put 
on in these households.

I, frankly, love “The Bachelor-

ette.” It is dramatic and hilarious 
and sad and romantic and weird 
all at once. I also have never seen 
a group of people get more heated 

than when I bring up the Nick vs. 
Shawn debate with my house-
mates, an amalgamation of smart, 
motivated girls in pre-med, Ross, 
psych, women’s studies and educa-
tion. Interning in the newsroom of 
a major national network this sum-
mer, the uber-successful women 
I worked under were the same, 
coming in every Tuesday morning 
ready to hash out the details of last 
night’s episode. What we choose 
to watch in our free time has so 
little to do with our intellect or our 
potential, so why do we rate it as if 
it does?

So, to be short, I love “Dirty 

Dancing.” I love it for no other rea-
son than watching it puts me in a 
good mood, and it’s bright, flashy 
and entertaining. We watch mov-
ies and TV for the spectacle. We 
watch them to see sex and vio-
lence played out in an enormous 
variety of stories and forms, and if 
you think that any of your favorite 
films aren’t revolving around these 
two themes, then take a closer look 
at them. No matter how we dress 
up these desires, they’re the same. 
We are entranced by the creativ-
ity with which these topics are 
approached. There shouldn’t be 
implicit guilt in confronting this. 
We like what we like, no strings 
attached.

‘Kaleidoscope’ 
is like an actual 
kaleidoscope in 
that it’s a mess.

Michigan wins shootout 

to end wild game, 
high-scoring series

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

In the middle of the second period, 

with Michigan down two goals to an 
unheralded Wisconsin hockey team, 
pandemonium broke out at Yost Ice Arena.

Four players were in the box, junior 

defender Michael Downing was being 
scolded by an official for trash-talking the 
Badgers players across the scorer’s table 
and the Wolverines had lost control.

Michigan’s upperclassmen mustered a 

tremendous effort to win in a shootout, 
7-6, but it was a frantic game in which 
neither side kept command for long. The 
shootout victory will earn the Wolverines 
an extra point in the Big Ten standings, but 
will count as a tie in the NCAA Pairwise 
rankings. 

“You don’t sing the song after a tie,” said 

Michigan coach Red Berenson.

Added Downing: “If you give up 10 

goals in a weekend, you should get swept. 
... Luckily our offense came up big this 
weekend.”

The game the day after a wild, high-

scoring affair 

is often a tight defensive contest. Saturday 
night, after a rollercoaster 5-4 win over 
Wisconsin on Friday, that adage didn’t 
hold true at all.

Instead, momentum swings and a 

slew of penalties in the first period 
ensured neither team would leave 
the arena satisfied.

Michigan (1-0-1 Big Ten, 

8-2-3 overall) jumped out 
to an early two-goal 
lead behind a season-
best effort from 
the second line. 
Senior forwards 
Justin Selman and 
Boo Nieves each 
recorded three 
points in the first 
period alone.

Nieves 

opened the 
scoring 
less than a 
minute and 
a half into

F

ifteen minutes before the 
Michigan women’s basket-
ball team played Pittsburgh 

in the Big Ten/ACC Challenge 
on 
Thursday 

night, a few 
fans stood up 
and 
cheered 

along 
with 

the band as it 
played 
“The 

Victors.” 
The 
players 

warmed 
up 

on the floor, 
and a guy sit-
ting courtside 
wearing a maize and blue Incred-
ible Hulk fist held up a highlighter 
yellow sign that read: “Fight 4 
every rebound.”

The upper bowl of Crisler 

Center was curtained off, and 
empty blue chairs occupied much 
of the lower bowl. When the fight 
song ended, you could hear the 
players encouraging one another 
from the top rows of the arena.

At first, the scene seems bleak, 

like just another chapter for a 
program that has historically 
experienced more failure than 
success. 
Michigan 
has 
never 

made the Sweet 16 of the NCAA 
Tournament or won a Big Ten 

championship.

But then the game begins.
The Wolverines punch the 

Panthers in the mouth from the 
get-go, taking charges and taking 
names against a team that defeated 
them by 21 points last season. 
Michigan leads by 22 points at the 
half on its way to an 82-45 victory. 
Freshmen and sophomores score 
59 of the Wolverines’ points, and 
Michigan improves to 7-0, tying 
its best start in program history.

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 

Arico, in her fourth season in Ann 
Arbor, is starting to see things 
take shape. Her first three seasons 
at the helm of the program saw 
little roster continuity, but a great 
deal of overachievement.

She coached a senior-laden 

team in her first season at 
Michigan in 2012-13 and led it to 
the second round of the NCAA 
Tournament. 
The 
Wolverines 

returned only one starter the 
following year, and Barnes Arico 
led the makeshift group to 20 
wins and a WNIT appearance. 
Last year, the team was led by a 
trio of seniors in Nicole Elmblad, 
Shannon Smith and Cyesha Goree, 
who had higher expectations. But 
once again, they won 20 games 
and made the WNIT.

Now, they’re all gone, too, 

and Michigan must depend on 
its youngest players. Freshmen 
and sophomores have scored 72 
percent of the Wolverines’ points 
this season. With this new core, 
Barnes Arico believes her building 
process is truly getting started.

At this point, none of the 

players 
on 
Michigan’s 
roster 

have played for a coach in college 
other than Barnes Arico, and that 
prospect excites her. She has been 
preparing to coach this freshman 
class since she arrived four years 
ago.

She has watched freshman 

guard 
Boogie 
Brozoski 
since 

she was in middle school and 
freshman guard Nicole Munger 
since she was 14. Former Michigan 
coach Kevin Borseth told Barnes 
Arico she needed to call now-6-
foot-5 freshman center Hallie 
Thome soon after Barnes Arico 
took the job. The three freshmen 
were rated in the top 100 in their 
recruiting class by ESPN, and they 
all decided to take a risk alongside 
Barnes Arico.

She made them want to come 

to Michigan by telling them they 
could do things that have never 
been done before, like putting 
together a run in the NCAA 

Tournament. That’s what she told 
star sophomore guard Katelynn 
Flaherty, who was being recruited 
by top schools all over the country.

Barnes Arico’s plan toward this 

relevance hinges on one motto, 
and it has for all four of her years 
at Michigan: that the Wolverines 
are the hardest-working team in 
America. 

It 
sounds 
like 
typical 

coachspeak at first. What coach 
doesn’t think his or her team is 
the hardest-working? But then she 
keeps going.

“So when we say hardest-

working team in America, well, 
how do we judge being the hardest-
working 
team 
in 
America?” 

Barnes Arico said Wednesday. 
“We can’t just say that. What 
does that mean? I want proof. We 
chart practice every day. How 
many loose balls are you getting in 
practice? How many charges are 
you getting in practice? And then 
we do it in the games.”

For those, Barnes Arico has 

a sticker system. Each player is 
awarded stickers that are placed 
on a block ‘M’ for her performance 
and how many of the “intangible” 
things she does during games, like 
diving on the ground for loose balls 
and taking charges. Those are 

frequently the measures Barnes 
Arico uses to judge her players, not 
points scored or assists dished out. 
If a player has only a few stickers, 
she will hear it from Barnes Arico. 
How could someone possibly be 
one of the hardest-working players 
in America if she has just three 
stickers?

Barnes Arico knows she can’t 

yet recruit players as talented as 
the ones perennial powerhouses 
Connecticut and Notre Dame are 
getting, but she’s starting to sign 
players a step below that level. 
Multiple recruiting sites rank the 
recruiting class that will arrive 
next fall as one of the top 25 
classes in the nation.

The plan is progressing on the 

court, too. Flaherty is averaging 
21.3 points per game. Thome starts 
in the low post for the Wolverines 
and is the team’s second-leading 
scorer. Brozoski and Munger are 
aren’t far behind, each coming 
off the bench as freshmen and 
averaging more than eight points 
per game.

Michigan won its first seven 

games of this season by at least 17 
points, but it knows tougher times 
are ahead. Sunday, the Wolverines 
lost to Princeton, a borderline top-
25 team, by 17. Four Big Ten teams 

are currently ranked in the AP 
Poll, and Iowa is the first team out.

Barnes Arico won’t put a 

timetable on her plan for Michigan 
to arrive as a major player on the 
national scene, but she believes it 
will happen. She wouldn’t have 
left St. John’s, where she led the 
Red Storm to the Sweet 16, if she 
didn’t hold that belief.

Her goal is to make things 

happen for Michigan women’s 
basketball that haven’t happened 
before. Now that she has all of 
her own recruits in place, making 
a run to the Sweet 16 some day 
down the road in front of a packed 
Crisler Center doesn’t seem like 
such a pipe dream.

“And we always talk about that 

when you get to that point, it’s one 
game,” Barnes Arico said. “And 
who knows what could happen?”

What could happen is that 

maybe, just maybe, if the players 
who are almost talented enough 
work harder than everybody else, 
Michigan could be among the best 
teams in America.

Barnes Arico wouldn’t mind 

adding that to her motto.

At Princeton, ‘M’ suffers 
first defeat of the season

By TED JANES 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team was able to 
redeem one of its early-season 
losses 
from 
last 

year 
this 

weekend, 
but it couldn’t make up for both. 
After crushing Pittsburgh — a 
team that beat the Wolverines 
last season — on Thursday, the 
team couldn’t produce the same 
result Sunday against Princeton.

Sophomore guard Katelynn 

Flaherty put up an impressive 
33 points against the Tigers, but 
Michigan didn’t get much help 
from anyone else and fell on the 
road, 74-57.

The loss is Michigan’s first of 

the season but second straight 
to Princeton (6-1). Last year, the 
Tigers beat the Wolverines (7-1) 
by 30 in Ann Arbor, the team’s 
worst loss of the season.

Matching up with Flaherty for 

the second time in as many years, 
Princeton looked fully prepared 
to isolate the star guard. The 
Tigers, though, didn’t need to 
rely on defense, because the 
Wolverines were doing all the 
work for them.

Michigan’s Achilles’ heel was 

a poor shooting performance in 
the first half. Excluding Flaherty, 
the Wolverines shot 2-for-19 in 
the half, and until five minutes 
remained in the second quarter, 
Flaherty was the only Wolverine 
to make a field goal.

Playing catch-up all game, 

Michigan managed to bump its 
shooting up to 36 percent by the 
end, but it looked nothing like 
the squad that was averaging 87.9 
points per game before heading 
to New Jersey.

“We 
couldn’t 
really 
get 

anything going on the offensive 
end, so I thought maybe if 
we changed the defense and 
pressure them a little bit maybe 
we’d be able to get anything off of 

turnovers,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “It really 
didn’t happen.”

The Wolverines turned on the 

press in the second quarter, but 
getting Princeton to turn the ball 
over was far more difficult than it 
was against previous opponents 
like Oral Roberts and Pittsburgh.

Led 
by 
guard 
Michelle 

Miller’s 24 points and eight 
rebounds, Princeton’s starting 
five outperformed Michigan’s. 
Three of its starters ended with 
double digits, while Michigan’s 
second-leading 
scorer 
behind 

Flaherty was junior guard Siera 
Thompson, who had eight.

Michigan 
has 
just 
four 

scholarship upperclassmen, and 
its inexperience finally surfaced.

“We really looked young,” 

Barnes Arico said. “For the first 
time all year long we were really 
exposed.

“When I was in the locker 

room talking about the freshmen, 
I just see Katelynn Flaherty just 
shaking her head the entire time 

like ‘I was there. I understand 
what 
you’re 
going 
through. 

People beat me. People were 
physical.’ ”

Princeton shut down freshman 

center Hallie Thome, usually a 
reliable scorer. At 6-foot-5, she led 
the nation in field goal percentage 
with 76.7 percent prior to the 
weekend. But Thome struggled 
against the Tigers’ physically 
stronger frontcourt, tallying just 
three points while shooting 25 
percent from the floor.

Michigan’s 
other 
key 

freshmen, guards Nicole Munger 
and Boogie Brozoski, combined 
for four points and five turnovers. 

Two of the starters — senior 

guard Madison Ristovski and 
sophomore 
forward 
Jillian 

Dunston — failed to score at all.

It was an ugly loss, but 

Princeton was also Michigan’s 
first 
actual 
test, 
and 
the 

Wolverines 
couldn’t 
have 

expected 
another 
lopsided 

win like they had become 
accustomed to.

Sophomore middle blocker Claire Kieffer-Wright finished with 14 kills in five sets against UCLA on Saturday night.
Michigan’s season ends

By ORION SANG

Daily Sports Writer

Two sets into its second-round 

NCAA Tournament matchup, the 
Michigan volleyball team found 
itself 
up 

2-0, one set 
away from 
knocking 
off No. 14 UCLA in Los Angeles. 
But the Wolverines couldn’t finish 
the job, losing three straight 
sets to drop their match 3-2 on 
Saturday, ending their season.

It was the mirror opposite of 

Michigan’s 3-1 victory against 
Santa Clara the previous night, 
when it rallied after losing the 
first set to win three straight and 
advance to the second round.

The loss ended a season in 

which the Wolverines (20-13 
overall) were able to make history, 
beating 
two-time 
reigning 

national champions Penn State 
on the road for the first time in 
program history, while dealing 
with a flurry of lineup changes.

“One of the important things 

about this team is that we changed 
our lineup around almost every 
match,” said Michigan coach Mark 
Rosen. “It gave us the opportunity 
to keep getting better, to keep 
tweaking things, and the team 
really responded to that.”

Against the Bruins (25-7), 

however, the Wolverines were 
unable to get the job done.

Michigan was jittery to open 

the first set, losing the first four 
points before righting the ship. 
The Wolverines fought back to 
tie the score at nine before falling 
into another hole down 21-19.

Michigan showed resilience, 

though, winning three straight 
points to take a set lead it did 
not relinquish, and sophomore 
defensive 
specialist 
Caroline 

Knop finished the set with a 
crucial kill.

The Wolverines left the court 

pumped up after their 25-23 first-
set victory, bracing for a second set 
that was just as tight as the first.

The two teams went back and 

forth throughout the frame, with 
neither stringing together more 
than three consecutive points.

Tied at 24, though, Knop came 

through in the clutch again with 
another kill to give the Wolverines 
a one-point lead before a UCLA 
attack error gave Michigan the 
set, 26-24.

The Wolverines ran into the 

locker room poised to take the 
match. But when they returned, 
things began to fall apart.

The Bruins quickly staked out 

to a 7-1 lead in the third set, and 
Michigan was unable to close the 
gap, losing 25-22.

The fourth set was similar. 

Michigan fell behind 18-13 after a 
series of errors, perhaps reflecting 
the Wolverines’ fatigue, and lost 
the set, 25-20.

In the winner-take-all fifth set, 

Michigan was outmatched by a 
Bruins team that had momentum 
from the third and fourth sets. 
UCLA committed just two errors 
and tallied 12 kills en route to 
taking the set 15-11, earning a 
berth to the third round.

It was a bitter ending to a season 

that had many ups and downs.

After the loss, junior middle 

blocker 
Abby 
Cole 
reflected 

upon her team’s season, which, 
in addition to the road win over 
then-No. 4 Penn State, included 
victories over then-No. 14 Ohio 
State and then-No. 18 Illinois.

“I’m really proud of this team,” 

Cole said. “We’ve done some 
pretty special things this season, 
making history like beating two 
top-15 teams back-to-back. It’s 
moments like that we’ll really 
hold onto, and I’m really proud of 
this team.”

Added 
Rosen: 
“Wins 
and 

losses are huge, but how much 
this team has grown individually 
and collectively is what I’m 
really going to remember about 
this group. The hardest part is 
this team doesn’t get to practice 
tomorrow and doesn’t get to play 
another match.”

the open net. Just minutes later, 
Nieves broke the puck out on 
the penalty kill and burned a 
Badgers defender before taking 
the puck the length of the ice. He 
hit Selman, scorching in from the 
left side, with the pass and just 
like that, Michigan had its biggest 
lead of the weekend series.

Wisconsin tied things up with 

a pair of very similar power-play 
goals from forward Ryan Wagner. 
The scores came four minutes 
apart, both on tipped pucks that 
slid between Zach Nagelvoort’s 
pads. It was the start of a long 
night for the junior goaltender, 
who wouldn’t last two full periods.

But Michigan rebounded again. 

Selman added another goal late in 
the period when he again found 
himself alone in front and roofed 
the puck into the right corner. 

Things came unraveled in the 

second for the Wolverines. The 
Badgers won the period, 3-0, 
and stole the momentum from 
Michigan’s hot start.

After a slow start to the period, 

Wisconsin (0-1-1, 3-6-5) scored 
twice in two minutes. The first, 
an effort from defenseman Tim 
Davison, came with an extra 
attacker after Michigan took its 
fourth penalty of the game. It 
was the third goal the Wolverines 
gave up while down a man — the 
Badgers had yet to take a penalty.

The next goal, credited to 

forward Matthew Freytag, was 
more of an own goal by Michigan 
freshman defender Joe Cecconi, 
who tipped the puck up and over 
Nagelvoort’s shoulder.

With the collapse already 

underway, 
Berenson 
had 
to 

change something. Out came 
Nagelvoort, 
who 
posted 

a 
disappointing 
.800 
save 

percentage on 20 shots, for 
freshman Chad Catt, who made 
his first appearance in a close 
game.

“The 
lights 
are 
bright, 
I 

remember that ever since I was a 
little kid,” Catt said. “It’s just nice 
to finally play a good portion of a 
game here and feel the energy of 
the crowd.”

To add insult to injury, though, 

Wisconsin forward Jarod Zirbel 
finished the period with a pretty 
behind-the-back pass that left his 
teammate wide open for the goal. 
The Badgers entered the second 
intermission with a two-goal lead.

Catt finished with 12 saves on 

14 shots.

The third period was a fitting 

finish to the weekend series.

Michigan took the ice with 

speed and determination, egged 
on again by the upperclassmen. It 
was junior forward JT Compher, 
who said Friday in the postgame 
presser that the team didn’t want 
to be known as “the comeback 
kids,” who delivered the rally.

Compher assisted on the first 

goal with a pretty backhand that 
found Tyler Motte on the far 
side of the net. Motte, a junior 
forward, buried the one-timer.

Three 
minutes 
later, 

sophomore defenseman Nolan de 
Jong hit Compher with a perfect 
cross ice pass. Compher raced 
into the zone all alone and walked 
by Jurusik with a toe drag to find 
the back of the net.

“That was a world-class pass 

from Nolan de Jong,” Compher 
said. “He put it over three sticks 
right on my tape in stride. I 
couldn’t ask for anything more 
than that. I was lucky to put it in.”

Junior defenseman Michael 

Downing added a blast from the 
point to Michigan’s tally with 
under 10 minutes to play, putting 
the Wolverines ahead with the 
finish line in sight.

Catt played a strong final 

nine 
minutes, 
but 
conceded 

Wisconsin’s 
fourth 
extra-

attacker goal on the night.

The Badgers took a penalty as 

the game headed to overtime, and 
the five minutes of sudden death 
hockey were punctuated by a 
roaring intensity from the crowd.

Michigan couldn’t capitalize 

in the extra five minutes and a 
shootout decided the game.

Catt turned away both shots 

he saw in the shootout, staring 
intently into the ice with his back 
turned as his teammates shot.

Compher and junior Alex Kile 

scored to seal the 7-6 shootout 
win.

That result certainly hurts less 

than a loss, but the Wolverines 
were disappointed because a 
victory could have been had. 
Michigan 
failed 
to 
put 
the 

Badgers away on Saturday night, 
and in the process let the chance 
at a 2-0 weekend slip away.

Compher, Motte power ‘M’

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Six minutes into the third 

period Saturday, the Michigan 
hockey team once again found 
itself trailing Wisconsin on home 
ice.

Junior center JT Compher 

received 
the 
puck 
at 
the 

Wolverines’ offensive blue line 
and carried it toward goal. He 
burst to the net from the right 
side of the ice, beat Wisconsin 
defender Eddie Wittchow to the 
crease and dragged the puck to 
his backhand before lighting the 
lamp to equalize the game at five.

Michigan’s captain made a 

beeline for the left side of the 
rink and threw himself into the 
boards, leaving just a layer of 
plexiglass between him and the 
Children of Yost, who had erupted 
into pandemonium — injecting a 
newfound energy into everyone 
that surrounded him.

“That’s JT. That’s his DNA,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson. “He’s a fiery player. 
He’s an intense competitor. He’s a 
leader. He knows that if this team 
is going to go, he’s got to be a big 
part of it. He showed that again 
tonight.”

Added Compher: “I think any 

hockey player wants the puck 
on your stick when your team is 
down. But we had some really big 
performances by a lot of guys.”

One of those guys was junior 

forward Tyler Motte.

Motte’s 
biggest 
moment 

came 3:22 into the third period 
of Friday’s matchup, as the two 
teams were locked at four after a 
seven-goal second period.

After the Wisconsin defense 

mishandled 
a 
puck 
in 
the 

air, 
Motte 
made 
them 
pay, 

finishing the opportunity on the 
goaltender’s glove-hand side to 
give Michigan its first lead of the 
game.

“He blocked big shots. He kills 

penalties,” Berenson said Friday. 
“He’s playing like an MVP player, 

and he should. He’s a junior, and 
he knows he’s got a big role on this 
team. He’s earning it.”

Those were just two of the 

momentum-swinging plays that 
Compher and Motte made this 
weekend. The duo willed the 
Wolverines to a five-point, Big 
Ten-opening 
series against 
the 
Badgers 

(0-1-1 Big Ten, 
3-6-5 overall).

Things were 

supposed 
to 

be easier for 
Michigan (1-0-
0-1, 8-2-3) in its 
two-game stint 
against a Wisconsin team that 
was struggling to start the season. 
Instead, the Wolverines found 
themselves needing two comeback 
efforts in high-scoring affairs.

The Badgers put Michigan on 

its heels on Friday, burying three 
goals into the Wolverines’ net 
in the game’s first 26 minutes. 
Wisconsin held a 4-2 advantage 
halfway through the same frame.

Even when Michigan flipped 

the script Saturday, with two 
goals in the first five minutes, 

the 
Badgers 

responded and 
claimed a 5-3 
lead 
entering 

the 
third 

period.

At 
times 

when the Big 
Ten 
opening 

weekend 
seemed like it 

would be a sour one, Compher 
and Motte snatched hope from 
the jaws of defeat. Behind their 
efforts, the Wolverines claimed 
a 6-4 victory Friday and a 7-6 
shootout win Saturday — which 

will go down as a tie in the NCAA 
Pairwise rankings. 

Throughout the weekend, goals 

weren’t the only contribution that 
Motte and Compher made. The 
two looked threatening every 
time they had the puck and were 
the engines behind a Wolverine 
squad that looked deflated at 
times.

“(Motte) 
and 
JT 
led 
the 

comeback. Let’s face it,” Berenson 
said. “It was all JT and Tyler, and 
good for them. Then our team 
started to catch fire.”

And 
before 
every 
fire 

comes a spark — a role the two 
upperclassmen were more than 
willing to play this weekend.

After a sluggish start Friday, 

Compher set the tone from the 
opening faceoff Saturday.

As the two teams lined up for 

the first puck drop, the junior 
got into a small scrum at center 

ice before the puck even dropped 
— sending the message that the 
Wolverines would refuse to suffer 
the same early fate as they did in 
the series opener.

Motte fought hard all weekend 

as well, and standing at 12 points 
this season, already has more 
than a third of his total from last 
year’s campaign.

The pair combined for six 

points this weekend: two goals 
that trimmed the Badgers’ lead to 
one, a tying goal and a go-ahead 
goal. Motte and Compher were 
clearly in sync, as both of their 
assists went to each other.

The results of the weekend 

weren’t perfect — the Wolverines 
surrendered 10 goals, yet still 
managed to earn five points — 
but Motte and Compher showed 
that, for now, there is no task 
too daunting for Michigan to 
overcome.

Junior center JT Compher scored a goal and an assist in each game this weekend, with his assist going to junior forward Tyler Motte.

and Tyler, and 
good for them.”

WRESTLING
Wolverines take 
seventh in Vegas

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 9 Michigan wrestling 

team didn’t leave Las Vegas as the 
big winner, but the Wolverines 
had a strong showing nonetheless 
this 
weekend, 
pinning 
three 

straight wrestlers on their way to 
a seventh-place finish at the Cliff 
Keen Invitational in Las Vegas. 
Michigan placed four wrestlers 
during the event.

The Wolverines’ first pin came 

in the 184-pound class, when 
junior Domenic Abounader used 
a leg turk to defeat Northern 
Idaho’s Chase Campbell 2:33 into 
the match. The win advanced 
Abounader into the quarterfinals, 
where he topped Ohio State’s 
Kenny Courts, 3-0. 

Abounader 

notched 
another 
victory in the 
semifinals 
over 
Virginia 

Tech’s 
Zack 

Zavatsky, 5-4, 
before he fell 
short 
against 

Cornell’s 
Gabriel Dean, 
15-6. This year 
was the first time Abounader 
placed 
in 
the 
Cliff 
Keen 

Invitational.

“(Domenic) was right there 

with some of the best wrestlers in 
the country,” said Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland. “He had a great 
tournament even though I know 
he was kind of disappointed with 
his final match. That will stoke 
your fire a little bit.”

Not to be outdone, fifth-year 

senior Max Huntley got a pin 
of his own in the 197-pound 
division when he double-legged 
Kent State’s Kyle Conel at 4:24. 
Huntley went on to grab another 
convincing win against Northern 
Colorado’s Trent Noon, 7-2, before 
he fell to Minnesota’s Brett Pfarr, 
13-3. Huntley’s loss was his first of 
the season.

Michigan’s third pin came in 

the wrestlebacks as heavyweight 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Payne 

Hayden defeated Gateway Bible 
Institute’s Damien Davis a mere 
0:24 into the match. Hayden’s 
win came following a loss to San 
Francisco State’s Sam Alnassiri in 
which Hayden was pinned at 2:20.

“It was good to see three pins 

in a row, and hopefully we can get 
better in that area,” McFarland 
said. “We’ll focus on that a little 
bit this week.”

Sophomore Alec Pantaleo had 

a strong tournament performance 
in 
his 
own 
right, 
beating 

Oregon State’s Joey Delgado, 
5-3, in the round of 16. While 
Pantaleo came up short against 
Oklahoma’s Davion Jefferies, 8-1, 
he rebounded to top Ohio State’s 
Cody Burcher, Kent State’s Mike 

Depalma 
and 

Arizona State’s 
Matt 
Kraus 

to claim the 
third-place 
consolation 
prize.

“This 

tournament 
is 
something 

to build off of 
(for Pantaleo),” 
McFarland 

said. “It’ll give him a lot of 
confidence.”

Rounding out the Wolverines’ 

placewinners 
was 
redshirt 

freshman Davonte Mahomes in 
the 174-pound class. Mahones 
bounced back from a round of 16 
defeat at the hands of Iowa State’s 
Lelund Weatherspoon to defeat 
Utah Valley’s Ross Taylor and 
Binghamton’s Jack McKeever to 
claim eighth place.

The Cliff Keen Invitational 

was Michigan’s final tune-up 
before the Big Ten season starts. 
Michigan will face Michigan 
State at home Thursday to open 
conference play.

“We need to come out with 

more of a sense of urgency and 
more determination,” McFarland 
said. “We need to make a quick 
turnaround.”

“This tournament 

is something 
to build off of 
(for Pantaleo).”

Michigan was up against some of the world’s best in Seattle at the Winter Nationals meet this weekend.
Wolverines dominate

By ANNA HARITOS

For the Daily

This weekend, the Michigan 

men’s and women’s swim and 
dive teams headed to Seattle 
for the AT&T Winter Nationals. 
There, the Wolverines swam for 
NCAA automatic and provisional 
qualifying times, while also 
aiming 
for 
Olympic 
trial 

qualifying times. 

The midseason meet was a 

huge success for the Wolverines, 
as a heightened playing field 
— which included Olympians 
Michael Phelps, Matt Grevers, 
Allison 
Schmitt 
and 
Missy 

Franklin — and strong team 
dynamic pushed the Wolverines 
to rise to the occasion. 

“It was a great meet for our 

teams as a whole, as about 70 
men and women traveled,” said 
Michigan coach Mike Bottom. 
“(It was) a really good team-
building weekend as well. The 
athletes were up on their feet 
cheering for each other and 
showed a very strong support for 
each other.” 

The races took place under 

different conditions than usual, 
as the team swam in a 50-meter 
pool compared to the collegiate 
standard 25-yard. Those times 
that qualified for the national 
meet would be converted to 
short-course 
yards 
for 
the 

NCAA.

“This meet was a little bit 

different because it’s an Olympic 
year,” Bottom said. “We swam 
long-course, which is a 50-meter 
pool, 
because 
the 
Olympic 

distance is 50 meters. We’ll get 
better adjusting to this distance 
as we get closer to American 
Olympic trials for Rio.” 

Together, the teams placed 

first, but when divided, the fifth-
ranked women placed second in 
the overall collegiate scoring, 
and the fourth-ranked men took 
first.

The women’s team broke 

a 
total 
of 
nine 
program 

records, and nine individuals 
met qualifying times for the 
American Olympic trials. Among 
those to qualify was freshman 
Siobhán Haughey. Over the three 
days, she took three program 
records and had the sixth-most 
points of any women’s swimmer 
at the meet. No other collegiate 
swimmer had earned more.

Haughey was not the only 

standout, as sophomore Emily 
Kopas broke the long-standing 
200-meter breaststroke record 
and the 100-meter breaststroke 
record. 
Joining 
her 
was 

sophomore Gillian Ryan, who 
placed third in the 800-meter 
freestyle, and sophomore Clara 
Smiddy, who took sixth place in 
the 200-meter backstroke and 
broke a record herself.

Senior Ali DeLoof finished 

second 
to 
Olympian 
Missy 

Franklin by less than a tenth 

of a second in the 100-meter 
backstroke and lowered her 
personal best, and program 
record, even further.

On the men’s side, Michigan 

put up a strong front. Five of the 
top-20 finishers in the 200-meter 
backstroke 
were 
Wolverines. 

Individually, six men qualified 
for the Olympic trials. The 
results showed a strong growth 
in many athletes.

“We saw great performances 

from all levels.” Bottom said. 
“Everyone stepped up. It was not 
just the top levels that performed 
the best.” 

Sophomore Evan White and 

senior Dylan Bosch earned ninth 
and 10th, respectively, in the 
200-meter individual medley. 
Bosch went on to take sixth in the 
200-meter butterfly, finishing 
three seconds behind Phelps.

The meet proved to be a fine 

marker for where the team 
stands, and it posed a challenging 
stage that many Wolverines used 
to improve their times. The 
opportunity to swim in Seattle 
was a valuable experience for 
swimmers of every tenure.

“This was a really long meet,” 

Bottom said. “But it’s really 
an 
exceptional 
opportunity 

for us to be here at this year’s 
nationals all the way out here in 
Seattle. We’re really fortunate 
to have Michigan support us 
to come out this way, and our 
Olympic effort.”

FOOTBALL
Harbaugh excited 
about Citrus Bowl

Coach announces 

Greg Mattison 
will be defensive 

coordinator for bowl

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

After watching three Big Ten 

rivals find out their bowl fates 
early 
Sunday 
afternoon, 
the 

No. 14 Michigan football team 
didn’t have to wait long for the 
Citrus Bowl to call. And though 
the Wolverines won’t play in the 
Rose Bowl or the College Football 
Playoff, they feel that their 
matchup against No. 19 Florida 
will be a worthwhile one.

“We’re very excited for the 

bowl,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “It sounds like it’s 
going to be great, fair, honest, 
healthy 
competition. 
We’re 

looking forward to it.

“We feel like we’re getting the 

long straw on this one, happy to 
be there.”

The game against the Gators 

will take place on Jan. 1, and at 
least one familiar face for both 
teams won’t be on Michigan’s 
sideline. 
Former 
defensive 

coordinator D.J. Durkin — who 
coached at Florida from 2010-14 
before coming to Michigan for 
the 2015 season — announced 
Tuesday that he would become 
the next head coach at Maryland.

Instead, 
Harbaugh 
said 

Sunday 
night 
that 
defensive 

line coach Greg Mattison, who 
was the Wolverines’ defensive 
coordinator from 1995-96 and 
again from 2011-14, would take 
control of one of the nation’s top 
defenses.

“I’m excited to have Greg 

coordinate the defense. I think 
he’ll do a fantastic job,” Harbaugh 
said. “He’s one heck of a good 

coach, and he can handle the 
pressures of calling defenses, and 
I think he’ll be excellent.”

Harbaugh said the promotion 

is just for the bowl game, but 
Mattison could be in contention 
for the gig moving forward if he 
wanted it.

It also appears that Mattison, 

66, will have his work cut out 
for him in the game. Harbaugh 
confirmed that redshirt junior 
defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow 
is highly unlikely to play and 
that sophomore defensive tackle 
Bryan Mone is still awaiting 
medical clearance to return to 
action.

Health is more of a point of 

optimism on offense, however, 
as fifth-year senior quarterback 
Jake Rudock is likely to play after 
leaving the Wolverines’ 42-13 
loss to Ohio State with a shoulder 
injury.

“He 
hasn’t 
thrown 
yet,” 

Harbaugh 
said. 
“He 
hasn’t 

thrown yet, but I think he’ll be 
able to soon.”

As for Michigan’s opponent, 

Harbaugh said he has watched 
about half of the Gators’ games 
this 
season 
and 
has 
been 

impressed, especially by their 
defense.

Florida shares a number of 

parallels with the Wolverines. 
The Gators improved by three 
wins in their first season under 
new head coach Jim McElwain, 
and laid a strong foundation for 
future years of playoff contention.

Harbaugh reflected on a year of 

improvement but noted that one 
game remains on the schedule.

“I don’t think of it as a 

foundation, I think of it more as 
a train — a locomotive building 
speed 
and 
moving 
forward, 

not static or in one place,” 
Harbaugh said. “We have a great 
opportunity to keep moving at 
the same pace we have been in 
this game.”

Robinson, ‘M’ pull away

Sharpshooter’s 
hot streak builds 
Wolverines’ lead in 

second half

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

Duncan 
Robinson 
shoots 

3-pointers 
like 
they’re 
free 

throws. Seriously — show up 
at 
Crisler 

Center 
an 

hour and a 
half before a 
Michigan men’s basketball game, 
and you’ll find the sharpshooting 
transfer 
guard 
tossing 
up 

straightaway 
set 
shots 
from 

behind the 3-point line.

Set 
shots. 
Robinson’s 
feet 

never leave the ground, yet from 
22 feet away, each warm-up 
attempt somehow seems to find 
the bottom of the net. When one 
doesn’t, Robinson — and anybody 
watching him — seems surprised.

Robinson, 
a 
redshirt 

sophomore, got four open looks 
from beyond the arc early in the 
first half against Houston Baptist 
on Saturday. He missed them all.

Down 26-24 in a Big Ten arena 

with their opponent’s biggest 
long-range 
threat 
seemingly 

having an off day, the game’s first 
15 minutes seemed too good to be 
true for the Huskies.

With 2:58 remaining in the first 

half, Robinson showed he’d had 
enough, ending his drought with a 
3-pointer that put Michigan up by 
10 and forced a Houston Baptist 
timeout.

He 
attempted 
four 
more 

3-pointers in Michigan’s 82-57 
win. He made them all.

The turnaround didn’t surprise 

many. Senior guard Spike Albrecht 
acknowledged one questionable 
shot selection on Robinson’s part, 
but called the other first-half 
misses “three of the best misses 
I’ve ever seen.”

Despite the early imperfections, 

Robinson never doubted himself 
— thanks at least in part to some 
sage advice from an unlikely 
source.

“It’s funny,” 

Robinson said. 
“I 
drove 
to 

the game with 
(Michigan 
assistant 
coach 
Bacari 

Alexander), 
and we ran into 
the 
parking 

lot 
attendant. 

He 
said, 
‘If 

they don’t fall 
early, keep shooting.’ (Alexander) 
reminded me of that at halftime.”

The game ended, effectively, 

once Robinson regained his form. 
Houston Baptist never managed 
to close out on Robinson, and was 
outscored by 23 in the game’s final 
25 minutes. The Huskies never 

threatened after an 8-0 Michigan 
run late in the first half, and the 
Wolverines coasted the rest of the 
way in their first home game since 

Nov. 20.

“He’s 

got 
a 
quick 

release 
that 

he’s 
worked 

hard at,” said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein, 
explaining why 
Robinson’s 
6-foot-8 
frame 
proved 

impossible for the Huskies’ zone 
defense to cover around the 
perimeter. “You can get to a lot of 
people. … Getting to (Robinson) is 
a challenge.”

As 
Robinson 
slumped 

throughout the first half, senior 
guard Caris LeVert — as he often 

does — took it upon himself 
to shoulder the scoring load. 
He scored 14 points on 5-of-
7 shooting in the first period, 
helping Michigan to a 37-28 lead 
at intermission.

LeVert, too, found success in 

the face of the 2-3 zone look the 
Huskies intermittently used. He 
finished with 25 points on seven 
field goals and 9-for-10 free-
throw shooting, Robinson scored 
19 points, and sophomore guard 
Aubrey Dawkins added 16.

“When Duncan and Aubrey 

are out there on the wings, it 
makes it that much easier to get 
the basketball to the middle of the 
floor,” LeVert said. “That’s where 
you want it in a zone. So when 
teams play zone and we have 
Duncan and Aubrey out there, the 
court’s a lot bigger.”

With junior guard Derrick 

Walton Jr. out of commission 
with a sprained ankle, sophomore 
Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
started in the backcourt for 
Michigan. As he was in the second 
half Tuesday at North Carolina 
State, Abdur-Rahkman was quiet 
on the offensive end, recording 
just six points on 3-for-8 shooting 
from the field.

With Robinson, LeVert and 

Dawkins collectively accounting 
for 73 percent of Michigan’s 
scoring, there wasn’t much slack 
for Abdur-Rahkman to pick up, 
anyway.

“It’s always good to know that 

there’s other people on the team 
who can score,” Abdur-Rahkman 
said. “You don’t have to force 
anything.”

The Wolverines punctuated the 

win with a volleyball-esque play in 
the game’s final minute. Fighting 
for a contested defensive rebound, 
Dawkins set the ball high in the 
air multiple times, eventually 
pushing 
it 
toward 
Albrecht, 

who bumped it up the court to 
redshirt freshman forward D.J. 
Wilson. He soared to the rim for 
an emphatic one-handed slam on 
the other end, delighting the few 
fans still in their seats.

Michigan avoids NJIT repeat

Wolverines cruise 

past Houston 

Baptist, avoid non-
conference letdown

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

Almost a year to the date 

after the Wolverines’ upset loss 
to the New Jersey Institute of 
Technology following a huge 
win over Syracuse, Michigan 
men’s basketball coach John 
Beilein was fully aware his 
team could be set up for another 
letdown on Saturday. 

Even 
after 
a 
hard-fought 

Big Ten/ACC Challenge road 
win Tuesday at North Carolina 
State — despite losing junior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. to an 
ankle injury — Beilein no longer 
believes in “guarantee” games, 
especially without one of his key 
players. 

Luckily for the Wolverines, 

Houston Baptist was no NJIT. 

The Huskies turned the ball 

over 16 times, which led to 23 
Michigan points, and shot just 
43 percent from the floor. It was 
a far cry from NJIT’s spirited 
59-percent 
shooting 
performance 
(including 11 
3-ponters), 
and Houston 
Baptist 
fell 

well 
short 

of an upset 
in the 82-57 
loss. 

“Last year, 

we 
probably 

weren’t as mentally prepared 
for that game,” Beilein said. 
“Coming 
off 
(the 
Syracuse 

game), we hadn’t learned our 
lesson. ... But give them credit, 
(NJIT) had a heck of a year. We 
lost to a really good team.” 

Perhaps more importantly, 

the Wolverines aren’t the team 
they were a year ago. 

Some things haven’t changed 

— senior guard Caris LeVert, who 
scored a career-high 32 points in 
the loss to NJIT, led Michigan 

against Houston Baptist with 
25 points and eight rebounds. 
But this time around, LeVert’s 

teammates 
provided more 
than 
enough 

support 
to 

pick 
up 
a 

comfortable 
victory. 

Redshirt 

sophomore 
guard Duncan 
Robinson 
continued 
his 

hot 
shooting 

streak, 
knocking 
down 
five 

of his nine 3-point attempts 
and finishing the game with 
19 points. Sophomore guard 
Aubrey Dawkins, who has been 
sharing minutes with Robinson 
early in the season, had a strong 
shooting performance of his 
own with 16 points and three 
triples, making up for two costly 
first-half traveling calls. 

The 
Wolverines 
certainly 

seemed to be playing with a 
different mindset than they 

were a year ago, jumping out 
to an 11-0 lead to start the 
game. In its strongest run of 
the afternoon, Houston Baptist 
cut the lead to 26-24 with 4:34 
remaining in the first half 
before a LeVert trey and five 
straight points from Robinson 
pushed the lead back to 10. 

With the NJIT loss still fresh 

in the minds of the coaching staff 
and most of the roster, Michigan 
decided it wasn’t going to make 
the same mistake in consecutive 
seasons. 

“It was stressed from the time 

we got off the plane after beating 
N.C. State,” LeVert said. “We 
knew that this was the game we 
lost year, and we didn’t want to 
have the same feeling coming 
into it (this year). So we came 
out and played hard for a full 40 
(minutes).”

Against NJIT, the Wolverines 

at least had the benefit of 
Walton’s presence in the starting 
lineup, though Beilein said he 
was a “different player” thanks 
to the toe injury that plagued 

him most of last season. Against 
Houston Baptist, because of his 
latest injury, Michigan couldn’t 
use Walton at all. 

But the Wolverines didn’t 

miss him much Saturday, thanks 
to stellar play from LeVert as 
the lead guard and some quality 
fill-in minutes from sophomore 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman, 
who 
scored 
six 

points in his 33 minutes, and 
senior guard Spike Albrecht, 
who memorably batted a loose 
ball toward redshirt freshman 
forward D.J. Wilson for a dunk 
late in the game. 

Abdur-Rahkman and Albrecht 

— the latter still playing limited 
minutes as he recovers from two 
hip surgeries — may not have 
expected to get so much playing 
time just a week ago, but they 
were just as focused as anyone 
on avoiding a repeat of the NJIT 
disaster.

 “We didn’t want to sleep on 

this team,” Abdur-Rahkman said. 
“We wanted to come out and play 
like they were a top-25 team.”

Senior guard Caris LeVert and Michigan had little trouble with Houston Baptist, almost a year after a disastrous loss to NJIT.

“We wanted to 

come out and play 
like they were a 
top-25 team.”

RUBY WALLAU/Daily

Duncan Robinson hit five straight 3-pointers and scored 19 points Saturday.

“He’s got a 
quick release 

that he’s worked 

hard at.”
