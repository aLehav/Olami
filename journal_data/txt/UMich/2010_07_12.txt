Building prohibits
smoking one year prior
to campus ban
By CAITLIN HUSTON
DailyStaffReporter
As the campus prepares to go
smoke-free in July 2011, some build-
ings are implementing the smoke-
free policy earlier in an effort to
create a healthier work environment.
As of July 1 of this year, smok-
ing within 50 feet of the LSA build-

ing entrances is prohibited, due to
a building policy initiated by LSA
Dean Terrence McDonald. As the
LSA Building and other campus sites
move toward becoming smoke-free,
the University Health System is also
preparing its services for the transi-
tion.
In a campus-wide email sent
out last April, President Coleman
announced that all three of the Uni-
versity's campuses would become
smoke-free on July 1, 2011. This
policy will make all of the university
grounds and buildings smoke-free
areas.
Robert Johnson, Director of

Facilities and Operations at the Uni-
versity, said the decision to make the
LSA Building smoke-free before the
rest of campus was due to the accu-
mulation of smoke around the build-
ing entrances.
"Every time you came in the
building you had to walk through
smoke, and that was bothering a
number of people," Johnson said.
Because of this accumulation,
as well as the fact that many offices
overlook the entrances, Johnson
said the different departments in the
building approved Dean McDonald's
smoke-free proposal.

Prospective 'U'
student to try
for regents bid

Boehme looks to bring
student voice to
Board of Regents
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
While most incoming freshmen
wait for classes to begin before get-
ting involved on campus, Simon
Boehme from Kalamazoo Central
High School is looking to break the
mold. Boehme, who has yet to reg-
ister for his first class, has already
begun campaigning this summer to
get elected to the University's Board
of Regents.
Boehme said being elected this
November would allow him to serve
on the board for his entire four-year
undergraduate career rather than
just two if he waited to campaign for
the next election as a junior.
To get his name on the ballot,
Boehme said he and his team are try-
ing to get the required 30,000 signa-
tures through campaigning and his
website - simonboehme.com - by
the July 15 deadline. With only about
1,000 signatures acquired as of last
Thursday, Boehme admitted that
they probably won't meet their goal.
According to Boehme, he and
his campaign team tried to contact
members of the Michigan Student
Assembly for support but never got a
response.
"There's no real Ann Arbor sup-
port, which I wish there was," he
said.
Even if he doesn't get on the board
this November, Boehme said he is
optimistic that he is at least making
a statement.
"I'm really excited to go to the
University of Michigan, and I have
a lot to learn and I'm ready to learn
and be involved and help make a dif-
ference and help to get a student on
the Board of Regents, even if it isn't
me," he said.
Boehme said the inspiration for
this campaign came when, as the
salutatorian for his senior class in
high school, he had the honor of giv-
ing his graduation speech in front of
President Barack Obam.a - the com-
mencement speaker for KCHS this

year.
In February, President Obama
challenged high school students
across the country to prove why their
high schools represent "the best that
our education system has to offer"
and agreed to deliver the commence-
ment address at the winning school.
Boehme said the KCHS principal
Von Washington Jr. pulled him out of
class one day to discuss the Race to
the Top High School Commencement
Challenge, askinghim if he wanted to
lead the project.
"I don't tell my principal 'no',"
Boehme said with a laugh.
The campaign began with the
submission of many essays, Boehme
said, and it ended with the making
of a video called "We are the Giants"
that the school sent off to the White
House, earning them the win.
Boehme said he and his classmates
received an overwhelming amount
of media attention for winning the
Commencement Challenge, adding
that he had interviewed with the
Associated Press, local news stations
and the Epoch Times in China. MTV
cameras, he said, also followed him
around school for a day.
"I was there from the beginning,"
he said, "and it was just something
you will never forget."
When he found out that KCHS
had won the competition and that
President Obama would be speak-
ing at their graduation, Boehme
said he decided to use his speech as
an opportunity to tell the president
about an idea he had to better con-
nect the government with the youth
of America.
The idea, Boehme said, was for
President Obama to create an all-
youth council that would give young
Americans a much-needed voice in
Washington. Boehme added that
it was the same idea of connecting
young Americans to governing lead-
ers that led him to consider cam-
paigning to become a University
regent.
"If I want to be a leader, then I
have to lead the way and I have to do
this," he said.
Boehme said he decided to lead a
campaign to "bridge the gap between
the Board of Regents and the stu-

dents" at the University, noting that
having someone who is always on
campus and immersed in student
life involved in the decision-making
process would be "something really
special."
"I find it absolutely ridiculous that
with so many bright people around
Ann Arbor, there's no (student) on
the Board of Regents," he said.
Boehme pointed to the student on
the University of California at Berke-
ley's Board of Regents, highlighting
the student reaction to the tuition
hikes in California as an example of
why it's important for students to
have a voice on the board.
As someone who is technically
not yet a University student, Boehme
said he has encountered resistance
from some people who believe he is
too young to be on the board.
"People have actually not signed
the petition because of that exact
reason," he said. "I don't have all the
experience that an upperclassman
does, but I have the advantage of
being the student voice."
Boehme, who said he plans to
study political science and possi-
bly business, added that he wants to
eventually pursue a career in politics.
"I don't want to be a career politi-
cian or a crooked politician," he said.
"As cliche as it may sound, I just want
to help people."

After review,
. University is
reaccredited

Two-year review
process yields
expected results
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
More than two years after work
began on preparing for the Univer-
sity's decennial reaccreditation,
officials have announced that the Uni-
versity has received the final stamp of
approval from its accrediting agency.
The Higher Learning Commission
of the North Central Association of
Colleges and Schools released notice
of the University's reaccreditation
earlier this month in a letter to Univer-
sity President Mary Sue Coleman. The
notice comes after a site team visited
the campus this spring to study and
evaluate the University in five core
areas - fulfillment of the its mission,
its preparedness for the future, the
overall classroom experience, engage-
ment of students outside of the class-
room and application of knowledge.
The site committee then composed
a report that was sent to its govern-
ing board, which officially accepted
the recommendation to reaccredit the
University earlier this summer.
Having been an accredited institu-
tion of higher education since 1913,
the University's reaccreditation was
not believed to pose any problems by

either the HLC or University admin-
istrators.
Earlier this year, former Univer-
sity Provost Teresa Sullivan, who will
assume the presidency at the Univer-
sity of Virginia in August, told The
Michigan Daily she wasn't concerned
about the University not being reac-
credited.
"I'm really not worried about us
being reaccredited, but it is important
to me for us to use this opportunity
and not just treat it as one more thing
we've got to do, but really take advan-
tage of it," Sullivan said in January,
explaining that the University would
also conduct a specialized self-study.
A reaccreditation self-study is com-
monly requested of large schools like
the University that are expected to be
reaccredited without incident. The
study focuses on a self-selected area
and is meant to explore how the Uni-
versity could advance within a given
area.
Ten years ago, the University
focused its self-study on interdis-
ciplinary studies. Following the
self-study, University officials have
focused on creating greater collabora-
tions between academic units in many
ways, including the implementation
of the president's Interdisciplinary
Junior Faculty Initiative - which has
committed the University to hiring
100 interdisciplinary junior faculty
members over the past three years.

Former University police officer Charles Beatty Ill appears at a preliminary hearing at the Washtenaw County District Court.
Former1PS officer
tracked prior to arrest

University police
documents reveal
details of arrest
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily News Editor
Former University police officer
Charles Beatty III, who is currently
facing charges for cocaine posses-
sion, was followed for over a month
by narcotics officers prior to his
arrest, according to the police report
of his case compiled by the Michi-
gan State Police.

Beatty is currently being charged
with one count of possession of less
than 25 grams of cocaine and one
count of an open container in a vehi-
cle, pertaining to his arrest while
off-duty on Jan. 13. If convicted,
Beatty could face up to four years in
prison, or a fine of $25,000.
According to the police report, the
Livingston and Washtenaw Narcot-
ics Enforcement Team's Major Case
Team received a tip around Nov. 18,
2009 that alleged Beatty had pur-
chased cocaine. Because the tip
involved a University police officer,
LAWNET officials contacted the
Department of Public Safety, who

asked for the narcotics team's assis-
tance in verifyingthe information.
The report also revealed that
LAWNET officers, who placed a
GPS device on Beatty's car, followed
him on multiple occasions, begin-
ning on Dec. 1, 2009 and ending the
night of his arrest.
The surveillance included follow-
ing Beatty while he was off-duty,
and recording his whereabouts
when he would leave his house.
The report stated that the sur-
veillance of Beatty in his car on the
night of Jan. 13 led to the call to have
Ypsilanti police pull over his car.

Purging the influence
Medical schools nationwide should follow 'U' example
E very day, medical professionals are relied upon by people at their
most vulnerable, and often, their most desperate. But their duty to
society is so vital that blind faith and deference to their moral scru-
ples is simply irresponsible. Every conceivable measure to prevent ethical
lapses among doctors should be taken in order to prevent the possibility
of anything but the patient's health influencing their decision-making. To
that end, the University Medical School's decision to discontinue corporate
sponsorship of postgraduate classes is a commendable step that should be
emulated by institutions across the country.

The steel grated doors are lifted,
and the fifty sad faces already sit-
ting in the plastic chairs look up
at me for answers. But I don't have
any; I never do. I don't know where
their next meal or paycheck is going
to come from. I don't even know if
they're going to make it through the
week. I just wish that, once, I'd see
that door lifted and not have to see
the same faces I see every Thursday.
Then I'd know something better had
happened in their lives.
But every week, I'm going to see
many familiar faces at the Delonis
Center - a soup kitchen on the west
side of Ann Arbor. As students at the
University, we have the moral obli-
gation to help those in need, whom-
ever they may be, because we have
the time to do so and because of the
self-fulfillment received in lending a
helping hand to someone who needs
it.
Opportunity. At the University,
every one of us has the ability to fur-
ther our education. We can utilize the
various resources the University has
to offer. We can increase the possibil-
ity of our success in the future. Not
only do we have the distinguished
opportunity to obtain a college
degree, but we're able to receive that
education and "college experience"
from the highly acclaimed University
of Michigan. Most people do not have
the opportunity to attend college
for a variety of reasons: inadequate
financial resources, poor standard-
ized test scores, lack of family sup-
port, poor guidance, etc. But we do.
Since we are given the not-so-com-
mon opp"rtunity tdo something
great with our lives, it' sour responsi-
bility to help those who might not be
able to help themselves. I know some
of you might say, "It's not my prob-
lem." But when that mentality rears
its ugly head, no progress can be
made. Thatithought process should
be non-existent when another person
needs help.
Time. Before my mom and dad got

married, they met with the priest
who was performing the ceremony.
He told them, "There are 168 hours in
a week, and God is only asking you to
commit one of those hours to Mass."
Well, I'm not God, but I'm asking
you to commit just one hour a week
too: through a community service
organization on campus, the Ronald
McDonald House near the Medi-
cal Center, raising money for breast
cancer research - something tangi-
ble that takes effort on your part. If
you already perform an hour of ser-
vice every week, maybe you can give
another hour.
Perhaps you think you don't have
time. But if you counted up the num-
ber of hours a week you spend Face-
booking, watching random television
shows, playing Nintendo 64 or Xbox
and screwing around with your house-
mates - you're bound to find at least
one you could devote tota person or an
organization instead. 168 hours a week
- someone is only askingfor one.
Self-fulfillment. That's what one
hour a week will give you. After serv-
ing eighty or so people every Thurs-
day, I might not get a thank you from
all of them. But receiving a thank
you should not be your motivation
for helping others - there has to be
a deeper purpose for giving your
time. Legendary UCLA basketball
coach John Wooden said it best: "You
can't live a perfect day without doing
something for someone who will
never be able to repay you."
Opportunity. Time. Self-fulfillment.
It's our duty to go out of our way to 0
do something that will better the
community, whatever that may be. It
doesn't even have to be something big
- just something meaningful. Our
opportunity lies before us to lend a
helping hand. The time commitment
isn't too great. The self-fulfillment
received will make your week. 168
hours - you just need to give one.

Nationally, as much as half of
the funding for continuing medi-
cal education classes comes from
private corporations like pharma-
ceutical and medical device man-
ufacturers. These classes, which
are offered to teach practicing
clinicians about new methods
and treatments, are mandatory
for doctors in many states, On
the recommendation of the Medi-
cal School's Conflict of Interest
Group, officials decided to end
any corporate sponsorship of
CME classes starting next Janu-
ary. The Medical School says that
it expects to make up for the lost
revenue with thriftier spending
and higher registration fees for
participating doctors.
The importance of impartial-
ity in medicine couldn't be more
black and white. Where patients'
lives are at stake, medical profes-
sionals should only be focused on
improving their condition, not
repaying an implicit debt to phar-
maceutical and device companies

who sponsored their classes. And
it's equally important for CME
instructors who teach doctors to
be isolated from the corporations
that indirectly pay them.
But the expectation that medi-
cal instructors can essentially be
paid by private industry without
any resulting bias in the way they
present the corporations' prod-
ucts is absurd. Whether or not
doctors are willingto recognize it,
commercial sponsorship presents
clear potential for the develop-
ment of biases among clinicians.
And while critics often cite stud-
ies in which doctors report no
bias in the way CME classes are
taught, it's necessary to remem-
ber that such a bias might be sub-
tler than doctors immediately
recognize. More importantly,
the doctors surveyed had an
interest in reporting no bias, as
they would have to pay more for
required CME classes were cor-
porate sponsorship banned.
And while doctors are gener-

ally well-paid, precautions should
be taken so that the costs for doc-
tors to attend CME classes don't
become excessive without com-
mercial sponsorship. To counter
this new problem, government
agencies could create CME fund-
ing pools. Pharmaceutical cor-
porations who want to sponsor
doctors' education about new
products - of which they will
certainly benefit - would give the
money to an independent entity
rather than directly funding
classes. Such a policy would put
distribution of CME funds in the
hands of governments and insti-
tutions, eliminating conflicts of
interest while preserving private
enterprise as a source of funding.
But the University Medical
School is among the first to bar
corporate sponsorship of CME
classes. In order to protect the
trust vested in the medical com-
munity, other institutions should
follow suit by purging their class-
rooms of corporate influence.

When I struck it, it just had to go in."
--Spanish soccer player Andres Iniesta, on his World Cup-winning
goal, as reported by ESPN yesterday.

Water skiing is more
important than my
GPA.
Okay, now
that my mother
is sobbing on the
floor while my m
dad dances vic-
toriously around
the room, allow
me to explain. ERIKA
* My resume MAYER
is pretty stan-
dard. Other than
its stellar layout - a template
designed by a tech-savvy engi-
neer - it's fairly boring unless
you're really interested in the life
of Erika Mayer. It covers academ-
ics, work experience and awards.
Squeezed in at the bottom in the
few extra lines left are a couple
of activities I do at the Universi-
ty: the water ski team, the Daily,
Campus Symphony Orchestra and
Model UN. I added them because
I think it shows how I'm involved
in activities outside of my classes
and that I'm able to manage my
time effectively.
Little did I know that one day
these few lines would land me a job.
I'm working for a Member of
Parliament in London this sum-
mer, and I recently found out just
how lucky I am to have this job.
My MP and I have been talking
about American resumes (or CVs,
as he calls them). Every year, his
office takes a couple of American
interns, and he says it's really hard
to pick which ones would work
best. They are all well-qualified,
and smart students, but on paper
they all look the same - flat char-
acters with no personality. He
told me that the over-competitive
nature of the American job mar-
ket encourages students to cram
their resumes with qualifications
instead of interests.
"But," you might protest, "I only
have one piece of paper on which
to explain how good I would be
for the job!" I said the same thing,
quoting something witty about
British A4 paper versus the Ameri-
can 8.5x11. Besides, I reasoned, I do
have activities on my resume.
Which, it turns out, is exactly
why I was hired. Only one of my
activities - Model UN - could
actually benefit my future career.
It's pretty obvious that I'm not
going to be a professional water
skier, as awesome as it would be
to have access to any lake in the

world. I'm not going to be a solo
violist in this lifetime. And as
much as I like writing for the Daily,
it's just something I do for fun.
Employers
care about your
interests too.
But including these on my
resume shows that I'm a well-
rounded person with a variety of
interests - and it shows I like to
have fun. To a potential employer,
these are really important. After
all, they do have to work with you.
You're probably pretty well-
rounded too as the University
usually doesn't let in single-mind-
ed people. Bookish English majors
store old pompons in the base-
ment and fraternity brothers have
trumpets in the corners of their
rooms. With so many student
groups on campus, it would be
practically impossible to not be
involved in something. The prob-
lem is that we aren't putting these
things on our resume.
My resume could be three
pages long if I included all my
hobbies, activities, etc. But we all
know no one reads past the first
page. So, like everyone else, I cut
down on the irrelevant informa-
tion. A snip here and a cut there
and suddenly this piece of paper
that is supposed to tell potential
employers who I am says nothing
about me.
It's time to give your resume a
makeover. Your life is more than
school, I promise, and employers
want to know that. Take Wilburt
Elementary School's Third Grade
Hall Monitor off your list and add
some interests. Your future may
depend on it.
As for me, I'm going to make
sure I keep my resume personal.
I'm not going to turn it into a per-
sonal ad, but I'll be certain that
it reflects who I really am. From
now on, that one sheet of paper -
be it British A4 or 8.5x11 - is going
to say, "Hi, I'm Erika Mayer. I'm
intelligent and qualified - and I
can water ski like nobody's busi-

Halto the new Wolverines

ast winter, some friends and
I were discussing the con-
dition of the University. As

second-semester
freshmen, barely
done with our
first Blue Book
exams, we felt we
had a pretty good
grasp of what this
place is all about.
"You know, the
problem here is
the number of stu-
dents. There are

TYLER
JONES

just too many people at this univer-
sity," my friend would explain with
all the cockiness of a college fresh-
man. That argument never made
sense to me. Some lecture halls are
big - I get that. And, surely, anyone
who has had to catch a bus to North
Campus understands what it means
to be on the front lines of the Uni-
versity's population problem.
But the argument that equates
more people with a lesser educa-
tion has never meshed with me. So,
when the University released its
admissions statistics last week, I
was again forced to consider what
an increasing student population
means for us Wolverines. And I've
concluded that some maize-and-
blue faithful are simply losing sight
of the mission of the University.
It was former University Presi-
dent James B. Angell who proudly
proclaimed that here you will find
"an uncommon education for the
common man." Yet in an age where
higher education has been permeat-
ed with elitism, some have lost sight
of this revolutionary dogma.
While researching this piece, I
stumbled upon the website Colleg-
eConfidential.com. Here, students
from across the country discuss top-
ics pertaining to their universities.
In response to the increased accep-
tance rate, Michigan students were

fuming. "Michigan should be more
selective," wrote one. "I'm kind of
embarrassed," vented another.
This, sadly, seemstobethenormin
response to the 6,350-person incom-
ing class. There exists a belief within
the halls of our University that more
students means inferior teaching, a
lesser education and a generally less
prestigious institution. This leaves
me wondering what happened to the
days of James Angell when the ideal
was providing a world-class educa-
tion to everyone.
Since its inception nearly 200
years ago, the University has been a
beacon of progress. The fact that the
University admitted 300 students
more than last year is neither an
effect of the state's economic reces-
sion nor a sign of declining stan-
dards. Rather, as the world continues
to battle an economic recession,
the Gulf Coast still fights to protect
its livelihood against the greatest
oil spill in history and the state of
Michigan longs to return to days of
prosperity and growth, the Univer-
sity is answering the call of a people
in need of the leaders and best.
The world today faces big chal-
lenges that demand even bigger
thinkers and doers. That some seek
to restrict University officials eager
to send the best and brightest into the
fray in the name of appearing more
selective to the U.S. News and World
Report college rankings is naive. This
increase in students is not a money
grab for our University, nor is it a sign
of diminishing standards. Quite the
opposite - when the world says "we
need more help," the University calls
in the cavalry.
Some will argue that as enroll-
ment numbers rise, the amount of
individual attention in the class-
room will diminish. Sure, this makes
sense on the surface - more stu-
dents equals less personal connec-
tion. But I'm here to make a different
EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:

argument: Easy personal attention
is a detriment to higher education.
Anyone who has taken Orgo or Great
Books knows that hand-holding is
not an option here.
Today, the
world needs the
leaders and best.
This "sink or swim" mentality has
caused some to label the University
"too competitive." But to many stu-
dents' surprise, come graduation,
there is no hand-holding. You either
find a job or you don't. There's no 5:1
ratio of graduates to mentors who
will help younavigate.Atthe Univer-
sity, you learn how to survive, some-
times against all odds. You learn to
seek help onyour own, discoveryour
own answers and develop the skills
necessary to thrive when the safety
net is gone. For some, this increase
in students will hurt. But for those
who want to explore and discover
through their own initiative, this
change will hardly be noticed.
This is no Mickey Mouse insti-
tution. Wolverines have become
captains of industry and president
of the United States. We developed
the polio vaccine and revolution-
ized investigative journalism. We
have stormed the gridiron and lit up
Broadway. From the silver screen to
the Supreme Court, Wolverines have
been leading the world forward for
nearly two centuries. Let us embrace
this incoming class of freshmen -
the largest in the University's his-
tory. Today, perhaps more than ever,
the world needs Wolverines.

SMOKE-FREE
From Page 1
With no-smoking signs around the
perimeter of the building, Johnson
said he feels that the building will be
able to make a smooth transition to
being smoke-free.
"We think that most people are
considerate and once mentioned to,
will refrain from smoking in the zone
we have set up," he said.
Beginning Sept. 4, the football
stadium will also become entirely
smoke-free. In the past, smoking
was allowed only within the stadium
gates, but with this ban, smoking will
be prohibited in all areas within sta-
dium walls.
Johnson said smoking has also
been prohibited around the entrance
of the Chemistry Building that faces
the Dana Building, due to the amount
of smoke accumulation that occurred
there.
As the LSA Building enters into a
new smoke-free environment, the
health systems on campus are pre-
paring accordingly for the shift.
Dr. Robert Winfield, Chief Health
Officer at the University, said the
University Health System has imple-
mented several smoking cessation
services that are available to stu-
dents, faculty and staff, including
free tobacco cessation counseling.
Though this service has been
in place for years, it has only been
offered to faculty and staff in the past
year and to students for the past six
months. In that time period, Winfield
said he has seen faculty and staff use
the counseling services more fre-
quently than students.
REACCREDITATION
From Page 3
This year, University officials
chose to focus on internationaliza-
tion. University officials have said
they believe the study could alter
the way the University thinks about
study abroad offerings and could lead
to a more centralized model to sup-
port international activities.
In a statement released last week,
Sullivan lauded the work of those
involved in the reaccreditation pro-
cess, adding that she was pleased
with the outcome of the self-study.
"The University is grateful to the
individuals and groups on campus
and across the state who participat-
ed in the accreditation discussions,"
Sullivan said in the statement. "The
knowledge the University gained
will strengthen and enhance the
educational experience of all our stu-
dents as it informs and shapes plans
for programs and activities such as
global education, multidisciplinary
learning and the evaluation of educa-

"I think that that is partly because
faculty and staff perceive smoking to
be a problem, whereas students who
generally feel somewhat invincible
are less likely to find tobacco use as
problematic to themselves," he said.
"I think that as the campus grounds
become more smoke-free, more stu-
dents are likely to say'I need to quit."'
Under the University health plan,
faculty and staff will also be able to
receive prescription drugs used for
tobacco cessation. But the health sys-
tem is still deciding the amount of
financial support for over-the-coun-
ter nicotine drugs for faculty, staff
and students, Winfield said.
"Our pharmdcy is going to try and
discount to some degree the patches
and gum and the lozenges, but we
haven't determined how much we'll
be doing it for the fall," Winfield said.
Winfield, who is also co-chair of
the Smoke-free Steering Commit-
tee - a committee that strives to get
input on the smoking-ban from stu-
dents, faculty and staff - said the
committee is preparing a report to
present in the fall on the different
issues they foresee as the campus
moves towards becoming smoke-
free.
Though some of the issues have
straight forward solutions such as
putting up signs around no-smoking
signs around a building, Winfield
said the committee is also discuss-
ing how to deal with smoking by the
edges of the roads. This issue differs
from North Campus to Central Cam-
pus, as the roads to the North are
owned entirely by the University and
owned mostly by the city on Central
Campus, he said.
tional outcomes."
In a press release issued last week,
Coleman also expressed her grati-
tude to all involved in the process of
reaccreditation and touted the Uni-
versity's high marks in the review
process.
"Many people - deans, faculty and
staff - worked diligently to exam-
ine where we are today as a univer-
sity and to look toward the future
of our institution," Coleman said in
the release. "The University not only
met the standards for accreditation
by the association, but it excelled in
nearly all areas, receiving high praise
from the review team."

a s JAKE FROMM/Daily
University Provost Philip Hanlon received a 64-percent pay increase after assuming the yost earlier this month.

PROVOST
From Page 1
of $366,000 in 2009. Sullivan is
leaving the University at the end
of the month to assume the presi-
dency at the University of Virginia,
where she will receive a compensa-
tion package valued at $680,000 a
year, which includes a base salary of
$485,000.
In addition to his base salary,
Hanlon will also received deferred
compensation of $75,000 per year.
However, he will only receive the
earnings if he remains at the Uni-
versity through 2014.
Sullivan had a similar agreement
with the University, through which
she was to earn $100,000 a year in
deferred compensation. However,
she surrendered the deferred com-
pensation when she announced she
would leave the University before he
contract was up.
And while Hanlon's new sal-
ary may seem a significant increase,
University officials say the increase
is in line with a competitive market
salary.
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham told The Michigan
Daily in an e-mail last week that
Hanlon's new salary was the result
of a survey among peer institu-
tions.
"As is often the case, the Univer-
sity Human Resources Office con-
ducted phone surveys among peer
institutions to determine the appro-
priate market rate," Cunningham
wrote in an e-mail.

Raising the salary of a high-
ranking official when recruiting a
new individual to fill the post is not
unusual for many organizations,
including the University.
Earlier this year when David
Brandon was named as Athletic
Director Bill Martin's successor,
University officials increased the
athletic director's salary by 47 per-
cent. Martin left the position with
a salary of $380,000, but Brandon
assumed the post with a salary of
$560,000 and an annual deferred
compensation of $100,000.
The salary of the University's
athletic director is paid completely
by the Athletic Department, which
operates as a financially self-sup-
porting entity of the University.
But neither Hanlon nor Brandon
are the highest-paid executives on
the University's campus.
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, currently the sixth high-
est paid president of a public uni-
versity, makes $553,000 in base pay
each year, and nearly $800,000 in
total compensation when including
deferred compensation, bonuses and
other benefits.
And in her first year as the Uni-
versity's executive vice president of
medical affairs in 2009, Ora Pesco-
vitz, made $700,000 in base pay
and was eligible for up to $150,000
in performance incentives and
$100,000 in deferred compensation.
Her pay was slightly greater than
her predecessor Bob Kelch who
earned a base salary of $684,000 in
2008.

DPS
From Page 3
"Due to the suspect and suspect
vehicle's suspicious activity on that
night, a marked Ypsilanti City PD
unit was contacted and requested to
make contact with the suspect and
vehicle," the report said. "The prior
contact led to the arrest of the sus-
pect for open intoxicants within the
vehicle and possession of suspected
cocaine."
The surveillance records show
that Beatty made a stop at the house
where he was suspected to have
purchased cocaine at in the past.
After a few other stops, the report
shows Beatty, along with two pas-
sengers, remained in the car with the
lights off on a darkened street for an
extended period of time, prompting
the officer following him to contact
Ypsilanti Police and request contact
be made with the vehicle.
Ypsilanti police officer Tony
Schembri, of the K-9 unit, said in the
report that he initially activated his

bright headlights to see the three
men in the car, and all three made
"furtive movements towards the
floor board below them and next to
them."
Schembri then said in the report
that when he left his car and
approached the driver's side door of
Beatty's vehicle, all three men inside
continued to move around. Schembri
noted that their actions made him
grow more suspicious of their actions.
Schembri said in the report that
when he asked what they were doing,
Beatty responded that they were
"just chillin' and listening to the
radio." One of the passengers of the
car pointed to a nearby residence and
said he lived there.
When asked if he had anything
illegal in the car, Beatty told Schem-
bri he had alcohol, but that was all,
according to Schembri's account in
the report.
Schembri wrote in the report
that Beatty said he was a police offi-
cer and had his firearm on him at
the time. Once Schembri secured
the gun from Beatty, he said in the

report that he removed all three men
from the vehicle to conduct a search
of the car.
Under Michigan law, an officer can
be charged for having their gun on
their person while intoxicated if the
charge is specifically for endanger-
ment or intoxication itself. Because
Beatty is not being charged with
intoxication, his possession of the
firearm at the time is not a part of the
charges he will face.
Schembri wrote in the report that
when he searched Beatty's vehi-
cle, he found both the open bottle
he observed earlier and a red cup
containing a similar liquid, which
smelled of intoxicants. Schembri also
said he discovered a small bag of a
"white powdery substance," which
he said he believed to be cocaine, in
an open pack of cigarettes.
Schembri said that when he asked
the three men whose pack of ciga-
rettes it was, Beatty identified it as
his. The report said that when he told
Beatty there was cocaine in the pack,
Beatty said he did not know it was in
there.
According to the report, Schem-

bri conducted a field test of the sub-
stance in the bag, which contained
just under a gram of powder, and that
it tested positive for cocaine.
The report stated that after the
vehicle and the three men were
searched once more and no other
contraband was found, the two pas-
sengers were released and Beatty was
taken into custody and escorted by
Michigan State Police Trooper Aaron
Darkins to the Ypsilanti Police Post.
Upon his arrest, Executive Direc-
tor of DPS Ken Magee and Deputy
Chief of DPS Joseph Piersante were
notified and arrived at the Post and
were allowed to speak with Beatty in
the interview room, according to the
police report.
But while he was in the inter-
view room alone, the report states
that Beatty made a series of phone
calls on his personal cell phone, and
revealed during those conversations
his actions before being arrested,
which included admitting to drink-
ing while operating the vehicle at the
time.
Beatty's phone conversations in
the interview room were recorded

on a VHS tape, which, according the
Darkins's statement in the report,
broke up occasionally in the audio.
Darkins reported that he made
DVD copies of the tape before put-
ting the tape in the LAWNET prop-
erty room, with the intent to send
the copies to "the appropriate agen-
cies."
The existence of the copies of the
recording was the reason given to
Washtenaw County District Judge
Chris Easthope when Beatty's attor-
ney requested for an adjournment
for the preliminary exam for his
charges on Thursday. The adjourn- *
ment was granted and resched-
uled for Jul. 29, to give time for the
defense to look further into the
recording copies.
Both Schembri and Darkins, along
with Michigan State Police Troop-
er Greg Setla, who conducted the
majority of surveillance, are listed as
witnesses for the preliminary exam,
according to the report.
Beatty currently remains out on
bond, which was set at $5,000 on
Jun. 10, the date of Beatty's arraign-
ment, according to the report.

open locations in 2

Fatburger, Five Guys
Burgers and Fries and
@burger seek new
campus locations
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
Ann Arbor residents looking for a
burger fix will have even more options
in the near future as gourmet burger
restaurants Fatburger, Five Guys
Burgers and Fries and @burger are in
the process of opening new locations
on campus.
The opening of the three burger
restaurants - two of which will open
before the end of this year - may be
in response to high student demand
for more fast-food options on campus,
according to the restaurant managers
and owners.
Five Guys Burgers and Fries will
open in September at the location on
State St. once held by Shaman Drum
bookstore, said Molly Catalano, a
spokesperson for the company.
According to AnnArbor.com, Fat-
burger is set to open an Ann Arbor

location next year. However, no loca-
tion has been confirmed yet.
@burger - which is planning to
open on Jul.17 in the McKinley Towne
Centre at 505 E. Liberty St. - is a new
venture that restaurant chain Big Boy
has decided to test out in Ann Arbor,
which could be the first location of
a national chain, confirmed Kurtis
Hoeve, assistant manager of@burger.
Hoeve said the restaurant could
serve as a place to get fast, casual
food, and would be a good place to go
between classes.
Hoeve added that while he expects
people of all different ages to eat at
the restaurant, he knows that stu-
dents will be their primary customers
because of the location.
Varujan Arman, the owner of
Quickie Burger, said the influx of burg-
er places to Ann Arbor is a response to
students' demands for a good product
at an affordable price.
Burgers are also a popular product
because they're the "All-American
food ... It's our food," Arman said,
noting that the current state of the
economy has driven many customers
to avoid spending too much on other
foods.
Hoeve echoed Arman's sentiments,

saying that burgers restaurants are
popular at the moment, because stu-
dents are looking for fresh food and
good service.
Arman said he chose to open Quick-
ie Burger in Ann Arbor because while
he was a student at the University,
he noticed the only late-night food
options were pizza and burritos. He
added that people seem to appreciate
the variety that burgers allow, and he
believes all of the incoming restau-
rants will do well in Ann Arbor despite
the competition, because they have
something different to offer relative to
one another.
To add to that variety, many burger
restaurants are offering health-con-
scious options like vegetable burgers
and salads because of the popularity
of those choices in Ann Arbor.
Hoeve said the food, ultimately, is
the reason customers will visit, and at
@burger customers can expect special
meat recipes and homemade sauces.
Great food is necessary to sustain-
ing restaurant business, Arman said,
but good service is another key ingre-
dient in any burger restaurant.
"We appreciate our customers,
because without customers we don't
exist," he said.

Y returns

'Winter's Bone' is a
summer sensation

On'self-titled' album,
M.I.A. turns up the
volume on technology
By SHARON JACOBS
ManagingArts Editor
M.IA.'s baby's heartbeat was
recorded for her new album,
/\/\/\Y/\, accord-
ing to her producer **-%
Rusko - but you
can't hear it above M.I.A.
the album's noise.
Then again, it's hard /\I\MyA
to hear anything on XL
/\/\/\Y/\ above the
noise that's been made lately about its
artist.
Most recently, writer Lynn
Hirschberg portrayed the "Paper
Planes" singer as a know-nothing
hypocritical agitator in a New York
Times profile. M.I.A. tweeted her
reactionary rage online, and soon all
facts were lost in the ensuing bitch-
fest.
It's true that M.I.A. drifts toward
the overly explosive. It's true that
Hirschberg unethically quoted and
wrongly portrayed her subject. But
mostly, it's just ironic that an Inter-
net-fueled fight proved so distracting
from an intriguing album that deals
with the ever-presence of technol-
ogy.
Leavingthe cyber-squabbles aside,

the best thing going for /\/\/\Y/\
(techspeak for "Maya," the singer's
given name) is its eclecticism. "Sound
of a bomb blast, throw it in the bag,"
M.I.A. pronounces above screeches
of revving machines on "Steppin'
Up," and she would. The track serves
as M.I.A.'s manifesto: Beyond the
repetitive and overconfident lyrics,
she really can make music from sur-
prising things.
The highlights of /\/\/\Y/\ find
M.I.A. spinning in different direc-
tions. Heavy-hitting single "XXXO"
grinds on thick percussion and blar-
ing beeps, but it's also one of the sing-
er's pop star-iest songs ever. "You
want me be somebody who I'm really
not," M.ILA. chants. Closer to sing-
ing here than she usually treads, the
Sri Lankan star proves that she has
a competent voice as well as a killer
accent. And, delivering the cho-
rus, her split-second pause between
the X's makes the combined letters
sound like "sex," or maybe "excess,"
or "success" - any of which, really,
makes sense for M.I.A.
"Lovalot" is a complete turn-
around, soft and shuffling over a
Middle Eastern-sounding base. More
enunciation tricks turn "I really
love a lot" into "I really love Allah,"
a clever twist of meaning furthered
by lyrical images of Taliban truckers,
burqas and bombs on Mecca.
Dubstep-inflected "Story To Be
Told" uses echoey nonsense voices
and morphing, layered beats for an


air of centerless nostalgia. Three
minutes later, the techno-Caribbean
groove of "It Takes A Muscle" light-
ens things up. And simple-minded
mantra "Born Free" enters with a
punch that it sustains all through the
Io-fi whooping and creepy electronic
pre-punk band-sampling, until its
final yelp of "Bo- bo- bo- bo- bo- /
Born free." The common denomina-
tor between all the tracks is M.LA.'s
typical singsong repetitions of phras-
es that kind of make sense, plus tech
references in both lyrics and music.
M,,,,-
L19
Peekaboo, I see you!
But although technology is sup-
posedly the underlying theme of
the album, the many appearances of
computers, Twitter, etc. don't actu-
ally seem to be saying anything about
the hi-tech life. "My lines are down,
you can't call me / As I float around
in space or the sea," states glitch-y

"Winter's Bone" has one of those
killer screen moments where the
audience suddenly, unquestion-
ably knows it's
hooked. It's about*
15 minutes in,
when steely-eyed Winters
17-year-old Ree
Dolly, trying to Bone
track down her At the Michigan
runaway meth-
cooking father, Roadside
Atactions
comes knocking
at the door of her
uncle, Teardrop. No one up until this
point has been able or willing to give
Ree any help, but Teardrop (John
Hawkes, TV's "Deadwood") knows
something. Rather than tell her, he
harshly throttles her and warns her
to stay away.
This is the world painted so viv-
idly in "Winter's Bone": a landscape
where every dilapidated house and
untamed forest hides terrible secrets
and unfathomable dangers. But Ree
has to plunge herself deeper and
deeper into-this blood-linked crime
underworld if she wants to save her
family from the hopeless existence
that her father has damned them all
to. And from the moment she looks
defiantly in the face of the man who

threatens not to go any further, we're
right there along with her.
As Ree, Jennifer Lawrence ("The
Burning Plain") projects an unreal
intensity. She may deliver the perfor-
mance of the year: rich with a sense
of maternal protection, yet tough and
hardened enough to stare all of her
oppressors (and there are a lot) in
the face without backing down. Ree -
has been charged with taking care of
her two younger siblings and mute,
mentally repressed mother by herself
in the harsh landscape of rural Mis-
souri. Her absentee father put their
house up for bail bond, and the family
will lose it unless Ree can track him
down. Lawrence makes us feel the
weight of the world on her shoulders
every step of the way.
Ree seeks
answers in a
desolate Ozark
landscape.
While Lawrence rightfully occu-
pies a large portion of this movie's
spotlight, director Debra Granik

Spineless 'Predators

It's time for this
movie monster-osity
to call it quits
ByKAVI PANDEY
DailyFilm Editor
In the late '80s, when Arnold
Schwarzenegger was at the prime of
his career, it became obvious that no
mere mortal was
enough of a for- **
midable opponent
for the awesomely PredatkrS
accented Austrian. At Quality16
And so the Preda- and Rave
tor was born - an
alien with the size 20th Century Fox
of Shaq, the agil-
ity of Kobe and the soullessness of
LeBron. Armed with blasters, blades,
invisibility, infrared vision and, inex-
plicably, dreadlocks, the creature was
a heart-stopping terror. But over the
years, the alien lost its sinister appeal
thanks to the very average "Preda-
tor 2" (1990) and a piss-poor pair of
crossover appearances in the "Alien
vs. Predator" series.
Enter producer Robert Rodriguez
("Sin City"), who saw what a car-
toon the once-feared Predator alien
had become and decided to restore
the magic of the original "Preda-
tor." The result is "Predators," and it
works to an extent - it employs some
truly excellent elements, but they
aren't enough to save the film from its
countless missteps.
The film's cast of characters - also
known as the victims that the aliens
will systematically kill off - is para-

doxically one of the best and worst
parts of the film. It's comprised of
a group of menacing killers (and
Topher Grace) who find themselves
dropped (literally) onto an alien plan-
et. As self-proclaimed group leader
Royce (Adrien Brody, "Splice") soon
deduces, they have all been brought
to the planetoto be hunted for game by
a group of Predators.
What's brilliant is the varied back-
grounds of the characters. Royce is
a guilt-free mercenary, Walton Gog-
gins (TV's "Justified") plays a con-
vict on death row; there's a Mexican
cartel enforcer, a Yakuza member, an
African soldier, anEastern European
soldier and Topher Grace ("That '70s
Show") as some pansy-ass doctor. As
a gaggle of strangers with a penchant
for murdering people, their interac-
tions are always hilarious and cap-
tivating. Especially entertaining are
Goggins, as quite possibly the fun-
niest murder-rapist you'll ever see,
and Laurence Fishburne (who's eaten
too many Krispy Kremes since "The
Matrix") as a whack-job survi-
vor hiding out on the planet.
At the same time, the fact
that everybody is a stranger
is the film's most glaring flaw.
When someone is inevi-
tably killed, the rest
of the crew doesn't a
care and neither
will the audience.
Not only do the
viewers have
no emotional
investment

in the characters, but everyone's a
freaking murderer, so few will be
shaken or saddened when the Preda-
tor rips out a man's spinal cord. In
fact, one may be pleased to see the
demise of such a wretched group of
scum and villainy.
And dear God, how badly cast is
the lead role? Brody playing a tough-
as-nails mercenary is less convincing
than Mel Gibson's claims that he isn't
a racist, anti-Semitic bum. It's laugh-
able (in a bad way) to see Brody spit
out orders and run around with a
machine gun likea kid playing paint-
ball for the first time. Even Isabelle
(Alice Braga, "I Am Legend"), the
film's lone woman, is a more compe-
tent, believable assassin than Brody.
Not to knock the man's talents, he
just belongs in less high-octane fare.
The action sequences are decent
but not spectacular, as are the special
effects - though they are impres-
sive for the $38 million budget. Other
things to complain about include the
countless number of Predators (one
is enough), the achingly slow
first act and all of Grace's antics.
Unless it's your thing to
watch a group of people you
- don't care about get killed
by cool-looking aliens,
you probably won't
like "Predators."
It is definitely an
improvement
over the Preda-
tor's recent
appearances,
but that's not
really saying
um much.

WINTER
From Page 9
("Down to the Bone") infuses "Win-
ter's Bone" with the atmosphere
and tone that make it so hard to tear
away from. It eschews any frivolity
you might expect from a mystery
starring a teenage girl: The life-
and-death stakes here are not only
real, but palpable. We fear for Ree,
because every new character she
encounters is more likely to harm
her than the last. And the rugged
chill of the Ozarks is expertly pre-
sented, as well, from the constant
need to chop wood to the bluegrass
band at a birthday party.
The script, which Granik and co-
writer Anne Rosellini based off of
the novel by Daniel Woodrell, is a
wonder. It's full of completely natu-
ral yet whip-smart lines that firmly
place "Winter's Bone" in the same
school of minimalist neo-noir occu-
pied by early-period Coen brothers.
An adversary won't let Ree speak
to a crucial figure because "talkin'
just causes witnesses." And when
Ree's teaching her younger brother
to shoot a gun (a scene that works
as a brilliant distillation of the sto-
ry's building fear and tension), she
commands him to "kneel down like
you're prayin'."
If the movie drags a bit in the sec-
ond half,it's only because ithad been
strung so abnormally tight in the
first. But rest assured that "Winter's
Bone" is a wholly worthwhile sus-
pense picture, and the way it builds
purely from mood and dialogue is
unprecedented in mainstream Hol-
lywood today. In its tale of a girl's
selfless attempts to shield her fam-
ily from the sins of her father, the
film weaves a fantastic tale from the
ice-cold underbelly of this forgotten
American wilderness.

M.I.A.
From Page 9
techno-popper "Space," but when
it ends, closing the album on a
drugged-out note, it's hard to tell if
that's a good or bad thing - ultimate-
ly, it's empty.
So maybe M.I.A. needs The New
York Times and all the hoopla that
surrounds her. That punk-rebel atti-
tude might very well hide ignorance,
and her cool musical innovations
could just be accidents. But whatever
M.I.A. is saying, we certainly haven't
heard it before. And she yells it loud
enough - and often enough - that it
catches on fast.
ARTS IN BRIEF
FILM REVIEW
Despicably trite
but endearing 'Me'

Despicable Me
At Quality 16 and Rave
Universal

0

Let's face it: Amidst the plethora
of animated movies at our disposal,
"Despicable Me" is, at best, cheap
entertainment. A mean old man
named Mr. Gru meets three orphans,
and they melt his cold little heart. It
leans far more heavily on the tried
and true three-act Hollywood struc-
ture than do other films of its kind,
and its humor is predominantly
crafted for children. It also employs
the all-too-common standard of
excessively cute characters that
manipulate and irritate with con-
trived tear-jerking.
But while some of the movie's
redundant standards may be grating,
they aren't entirely lost on an adult
audience. In spite of its lack of pro-
fundity and substance, Steve Carell's
("Get Smart") foray into animated
film still succeeds in other ways -
excepting his occasionally annoying
Russian accent.
For starters, it's almost guaran-
teed to make you feel like a kid again,
and its gentle demeanor makes it an
excellent date film. Most important,
however, is its unique ideation -
rarely does a film (especially a chil-
dren's film) invite us to sympathize
with a villain so readily. And for the
still-hesitant, rest assured that there
are indeed some laugh-out-loud
moments to be had, though alpha
males repelled by slushiness may find
themselves writhing in discomfort
more often than not.

Michigan DefensiveLine
Football
Season Preview

'M' hopes to replace Graham on D-line

Hybrid end/linebacker
Craig Roh is one of the
potential Wolverines
to step up on 'D'
By RYAN KARTJE
ManagingEditor
Unfortunately for Michigan foot-
ball coach Rich Rodriguez, former
Wolverine defensive end Brandon
Graham had no choice after last sea-
son but to depart Ann Arbor for a big-
ger and better career in the NFL.
And with the 13th pick in the first
4 round of the 2010 NFL Draft, the
Philadelphia Eagles' pick created a
massive black hole on the Wolverines'
defensive line.
Which begs the most obvious ques-
tion of Michigan's off-season: How
will Rodriguez even come close to
replacing the production of one of the
country's most dominant ends?
The short answer - he won't.
There's simply not enough talent
on the defensive front to replace a
gamechanger like Graham. But does
that mean all is lost in the trenches for
Michigan's 2010 season? Absolutely
not.
What Graham brought to the
lineup, more so than any Wolver-
ines since LaMarr Woodley or Mark
Messner, was the ability to disrupt
the quarterback - something that is
epically important as college football
programs look to the air more and
more.
It sure doesn't help that Michigan's
defensive back corps will be even
more anemic with the loss of corner-
back Donovan Warren. So now, the
Wolverines have no choice but to find
some other way to rush the quarter-
back.
At first glance, sophomore hybrid
end/linebacker Craig Roh seems to be
the obvious choice. Playing opposite
of Graham last season (technically at
the linebacker spot), Roh looked solid
in big-time games last year as a fresh-
man, recording 10 tackles (two for
loss) combined against Ohio State and
Penn State.
As a senior at Chapparal High

School in Arizona, Roh recorded 16.5
sacks, but his rawness was a notable
concern. Now, with a season under his
belt and a freshman All-America bid
to boot, this year could be Roh's com-
ing out party.
Rob's potential is clearly the most
attractive replacement for Graham's
vacancy as defensive stalwart, but
redshirt junior Ryan Van Bergen may
be the most practical choice to fill the
gaping hole.
With most of his time at defen-

finished second on the team in sacks
(five) and made some huge plays,
including returning a fumble recov-
ery for a touchdown against Wiscon-
sin. Van Bergen will likely shift out to
Graham's old position, so the pressure
may be on him more than anyone up
front to come into his own this season.
The most interesting battles for
time on the defensive line this sum-
mer, however, will most likely take
place on the interior as a handful

of different players battle for what
Rodriguez and defensive coordinator
Greg Robinson have all but assured
will be a platoon.
Mike Martin is the proven leader of
the defensive interior, and he should
have little problem getting into the
backfield and stopping the Big Ten's
best ball carriers in their tracks. In
the second half of last season, Mar-

tin amped up his performance in the
trenches, registering a combined 21
tackles in the Wolverines' final three
games, with one sack on Buckeye
quarterback Terrelle Pryor.
There's little question whether
Martin will show up this season,
probably on his way to one of the All-
Big Ten teams, but sophomore Will

tion mark on Michigan's line. The

Coaching legend Warhurst retires
after lengthy career in Ann Arbor

By RYAN KARTJE
ManagingEditor
After a 36-year coaching career
which included seven Big Ten champi-
onships, four Big Ten Coach ofthe Year
honors, 148 All-American honors and
five Olympians, Michigan men's cross
country coach and associate track
and field head coach Ron Warhurst
announced his retirement Wednesday.
Warhurst retires as one of the most
tenured coaches in Michigan history,
trailing the University's most tenured
coach - Cliff Keen - by just four sea-
sons.
"I have had a very nice run at Michi-
gan," Warhurst said in a press release
Wednesday. "I've coached some great
individuals who have become great
men and great friends, and I appreci-
ate all they have done for my career."
Included among those "great indi-
viduals" is three-time Olympian and
four-time NCAA champion Kevin Sul-
livan, who - in the same press release
- credited Warhurst with providing

the consistency necessary to build a
top-notch cross country and track pro-
gram.
"The results of his athletes over
the past 36 years are a testament to
his place as one of the great coaches
in Michigan and NCAA history," Sul-
livan said. "Ron Warhust is the face of
Michigan cross country and track and
field, and his replacement will certain-
ly have big shoes to fill."
A member of the 1964 and 1965
national championship teams at West-
ern Michigan, Warhurst came to Ann
Arbor in 1974, on his way to becoming
the winningest coach in program his-
tory.
"Ron Warhurst has coached and
mentored hundreds of athletes
throughout his 36-year career at Mich-
igan," Athletic Director David Brandon
said. "He has always been considered
one of the top coaches in the country
and his contributions to our athletic
program over the years have been sub-
stanial and most appreciated. We wish
him all the well in ... his retirement."

on the line, providing a run-stuffing
complement to Mike Martin's back-
field disruptor role.
But he disappeared in most.
games last year, and his learning
curve was, at some points, in ques-
tion.
This year, though, after adjusting
to the college game at the technical
level, Campbell should be ready.
If he's not, senior Greg Banks,
who many of the coaches have talk-
ed about as an emerging leader, will
absolutely be ready totake his spot.
Banks knows that Graham's leader-
ship needs tobe replaced, and judg-
ing by Banks' demeanor after the
spring game, he's ready to step into
that role.
Overall, the unit shouldn't suffer
as much as it would seem without
Graham, assuming everyone steps
up their game from last year.
But there's no replacing No. 55,
and the Wolverines maybe missing
him more as the season wears on.
