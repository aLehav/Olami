Students, faculty
remember him
for unwavering
dedication

Art and Design Prof. Shaun
Jackson, who suffered serious
third degree burns in a plane
crash in Sarasota; Fla. on Satur-
day, passed away Tuesday after-
noon. He was 63 and is survived

by his wife, Cathy, and family.
Jackson was in critical condi-
tion at the Regional Burn Cen-
ter at Tampa General Hospital
when he passed, the Bradenton
Herald reported. Neither the
University nor Tampa General
Hospital have announced the
cause of his death.
Jackson held interdisciplin-
ary professorships in the School
of Art and Design, the Taubman
College of Architecture and
Urban Planning and the Ross
School of Business.
Jackson began his career in
the design industry while he was

still a student at the University.
As a student he founded Eclipse
Inc., which has grown into a
multi-million dollar design and
manufacturing company.
In two decades in the indus-
try, Jackson acquired more than
50 patents and received numer-
ous design awards, including
the IDEA award from Business
Week. His design firm, Shaun
Jackson Designs, worked with
clients ranging from Apple to
Nike to General Electric Medi-
cal Systems.
Jan-Henrik Andersen, an
associate professor of Art and

Design, said Jackson's work in
the industrial design industry
was well respected. He added
that Jackson prided himself on
building moveable technology
that was "comfortable, func-
tional and stylish."
"Shaun always strived for
excellence (in his work),"
Andersen said. "He always tried
to install a high standard of
intellectual and artistic crafts-
manship in his students."

JACKSON
From Page 1A
sent to the school's community.
He wrote that Jackson's passing
was an incredible loss to the Uni-
versity community.
"Shaun has been a dedicated
and beloved member of our com-
munity, mentoring generations
of designers and sharing his
optimism and love of life with us
all," Nadarajan wrote. "He was
the model of an interdisciplinary
design educator."
One of Jackson's former stu-
dents, Art and Design junior Tay-
lor Ross, fondly remembers the
professor for his numerous and
long-winded anecdotes about
his experiences in the industrial
world. She said his real-world
experience and gift as an educa-
tor made him an extraordinary
professor.
"I learned more in his class

than I have in any of my other
classes,"Ross said. "Ijust learned
a lot of valuable lessons from him
.. he teaches students the value
of working really hard.",
Ross added that Jackson's
drive to design products that
were perfect and professional
was highly influential on his stu-
dents.
"He always strived for excel-
lence in all aspects of his life and
it definitely rubbed off on his stu-
dents," she said.
Jackson even offered a indus-
trial design drawing class on Sat-
urday mornings after realizing
there weren't enough courses on
the subject offered at the Univer-
sity. Art and Design sophomore
Terence Harp spoke about his
experience in Jackson's weekend
class.
"It was the best class I took,
and it wasn't even for credit,"
Harp said.
Harp said Jackson brought

high-level designers as guest
speakers and worked hard to
make sure students would have
the requisite design drawing
skills for when they graduated
and began to work in the indus-
try.
"Among the students, we all
had been touched by him," Harp
said. "He helped make a lot of
this stuff happen in (the design
program).".
Professor Andersen said
Jackson's work should live on in
his contribution to the Art and
Design program at the Univer-
sity.
"It is my hope that his legacy
in bridge building between busi-
ness and engineering and art
and architecture be continued,"
Andersen said. "That'd be the
best legacy."
Nadarajan wrote that the
school would notify students
once plans were finalized for
memorial services.

REGENTS
From Page 1A
staying at the forefront of higher
education.
Regent Denise Ilitch (D-Bing-
ham Farms) wrote in an e-mail
interview that the regents plan
to discuss issues such as afford-
ability and access, the changing
nature of how students learn,
changes in health care at campus
medical centers and the increas-
ing competition for research dol-
lars.
"I look forward to more meet-
ings that allow us to learn,
exchange ideas and promote the
virtues of the University of Mich-
igan," Ilitch wrote. "It is vitally
important to be an 'ambassador'
of our great institution."
University representatives
also hope to glean insight into
how UC administrators have
coped with the economic catas-
trophe that has crippled the sys-
tem over the past decade.
According to UC-Berkeley
spokeswoman Dianne Klein,
the state of California contrib-
uted only 37 percent of the cost
required to educate a student for
the current school year.
Nathan Brostrom, executive
vice president of business opera-
tions for the UC system, told the

development officer. California
has the second largest number of
University alumni, second only
to Michigan. It ranks second in
terms of out-of-state financial
contributions to the University.
"California is just a very big
area for U of M," May said. There
are an unbelievable number of
financially successful Michigan
alums."
May, as well as the two Uni-
versity development officers cur-
rently stationed in California,
will not attend any of the actual
meetings or seminars with the
regents. Instead they will host
two events to draw donors from
across the state. The regents are
scheduled to attend those events.
"This presents an opportunity
to reach out to people who care
about the University and want
this institution to thrive well
into our third century," Fitzger-
ald said.
The trip, financed by non-
general fund dollars from Uni-
versity donors, will cost between
$30,000 and $50,000, according
to Fitzgerald.
"This is a very small invest-
ment for a very high return,"
May said.

any innovative product faes
when first entering a new mar-
ket, Ghosn said. Innovators must
instill a sense of familiarity into
society with the introduction of a
new invention before consumers
can'trust and utilize the product.
Ghosn added that Renault-
Nissan must provide the addi-
tional resources - such as easily
accessible charging stations -
necessary for consuming the
electric cars before the product
can become widely popularized.
"This is kind of a de-bugging
period," Ghosn said. "Where the
de-bugging is not only linked to
the product but to the environ-
ment of the product."
Ghosn told the audience that
the world is prepared to accept
the reality that electric cars
will be more integrated into
the global society. However, he
added that governments must
support the concept of electric
cars as well. He pointed to the
Chinese government's removal
on Sunday of all official cars
from the streets of Beijing amid
alarming pollution levels as a
sign that 'zero emission cars are
a must.'"
Ghosn added that as the car-
to-inhabitant ratio increases
to close to 300 to 400 cars per
1000 inhabitants, electric cars
are becoming more imperative
to improve pollution levels.
"There is no way you are
going to avoid this kind of tech-
nology," Ghosn said.
In 10 years, electric cars
should represent 10 percent of
the market, Ghosn said, fol-
lowed by a progressive decrease
in pollution levels.
Ghosn said, in 2013, "without
any doubt, there is going to be
significant growth within the
MLK

growing commitment to racial
diversity, to creating spaces for
the University and surrounding
community to engage in topics
relatingto diversity," Ward said.
Audience members watched a
video featuring University alum
Larry Brilliant, former execu-
tive director of Google.org, the
philanthropic arm of the search
r giant. The video described
King's visit to the University in
1962 and the impact the visit had
on Brilliant, who is an advocate
of the civil rights movement. As
a part of a medical committee
for human rights, Brilliant trav-
eled with King to march against
the Vietnam War.
Two audio clips were played
of King speaking at the Great
March in Detroit in 1963 and
at the March on Washington

same vision that electric cars
should represent an important
technology of the car industry
and certainly something, which
is significant portion of the cars
offered on the market."
The future of the electric
car industry includes a fusion
between zero emissions and vir-
tual technology, Ghosn said. In
an age when information-based
technologies, such as music
players and tablets, are an inte-
gral part of people's daily lives,
people become increasingly
interested when those features
can be added to more aspects of
their routines.
Ghosn also said new technol-
ogy similar to that used in tab-
lets and music players will make
electric cars more interactive
and appeal to the growing inter-
est in information-based tech-
nology.
"There can be , a non-direct
interaction between you and the
car just by giving the car a lot of
your basic information," Ghosn
said. "It's going to make your car
your companion."
At the end of the lecture,
Jack Hu, associate engineering
dean for academic affairs, said
he and Ghosn discussed creat-
ing opportunities for students
to intern for Renault-Nissan
in multiple countries, such as
Japan or Brazil.
"He embraced that idea, and
we will be talking about these
opportunities," Hu, who intro-
duced Ghosn, said.
Jeanne Murabito, execu-
tive director for student affairs
for the College of Engineering,
said she is excited to provide
students with opportunities to
experience international and
real-world applications of what
they learn at the University.
"To work in, probably France
and Japan, and to have those
opportunities and to really

be immersed in those compa-
nies would be phenomenal,"
Murabito said. "We are expand-
ing those opportunities to our
students but at this point we
haven't really developed any-
thing with Renault and Nissan,
so I'm thrilled about it."
Engineering Prof. Elliot Solo-
way raised concern to Ghosn
that the education students
are receiving is not sufficient
enough to prepare them for the
visions Renault-Nissan and the
electric car industry are sug-
gesting for the future.
Ghosn said it is important
to learn the fundamental con-
cepts that apply to an industry,
but "learning how to learn" to
adjust to changing markets and
realities is crucial to succeeding
beyond completion of formal
education.
"Learning certainly does not
stop at the university," Ghosn
said. "Most of it will start when
you are joining a company and
when you are starting a career
... What we need are people who
know that it's going to be a life
long learning and who have the
basics, the will and the personal
organization."
Rackham student Yiyi Zhao
said Ghosn's points assured her
that she is ready to pursue a
career in autos.
"The classes here - Michigan
especially - are very helpful to
help us prepare for the future
industry," Zhao said.
Engineering sophomore
Sierra George said the gender
imbalance was noticeable at the
lecture as well as in the male-
dominated industry.
"It's intimidating in the sense
thatIdon'tknow how it's goingto
affect me," George said. "I don't
know if it's going to be an advan-
tage or disadvantage. I feel like I
am going to have to prove myself
more and stand out alot more."

Martha Pollack, vice provost for

as 40,000 gave a presentation to the regents
de in the about the University's role in
niversity's Coursera and eventual avenues

for monetization by charging for
continuing education and pro-
fessional courses.
"Historically, once upon a
time, universities were threat-
ened by the introduction of low-
cost printed books," Russell said.
"They survived that. That seems
inconceivable now. When we
look back at this time 20 years
from now, universities, I predict,
will still be around and we'll
have the same sort of'you're kid-
ding' response. 'How could they
think this could destroy the uni-
versity?"'
Russell added that MOOCs
have the potential to create a
competitive market for teach-
ing in which each institution
can market its most prominent
programs. The result, he said,
would be a general rise in teach-
ing standards.
"The question is, 'How much
brand loyalty do you have to an
institution that is doing a poor
job?"' he said. "I think quality
will be the great leveling effect.
We will see the rise of people
who are currently unknown but
are excellent and inevitably will
have a rising of the standard of
teaching everywhere."
The future of MOOCs is uncer-
tain, and Russell acknowledged
that he expects rapid change and
advancement in the next decade
as the field of MOOC providers
and approaches is narrowed.
In the near term, Russell
expects MOOCs to advance in
both their ability to provide
"community aspects of learn-
ing" and interactive models. He
added that social media will play
a vital role in determining the
success or failure of MOOCs.
"You get this kind of com-
munity effect among people
who have never met and never
will meet," Russell said. "In our
MOOCs, that's surprising more
than anything else. You get stu-
dents from Pakistan helping out
students in South Africa, stu-
dents in South Africa helpingout
students in Brazil, and students
in Brazil helping out students in
Ann Arbor. It goes in this virtu-
ous circle."
"The social media stuff is
really important," Russell added.
"Without them, I think it will be
a quiet, lonely place in this class-
room. With them, it's very inter-
esting, very different."

cation leaders and donors,
Fitzgerald said the regents will

the absence of an official Janu-
ary meeting.

assembly to hold only seven or
eight more meetings before this
year's elections in March.
Proppe said he's been pleased
with the productivity of the
assembly, explaining it left less
than $1,000 in last semester's leg-
islative discretionary fund after
starting with about $11,000.
Some of the projects that the
assembly funded - at least in part
- included organizing a "Beat
MSU" pep rally, forming a chap-
ter of the Food Recovery Network
and founding Optimize, social
entrepreneurship group.
Proppe said he doesn't expect
the remaining meetings to turn
into lame-duck sessions, adding
that he's aware of multiple rep-
resentatives who are working on
projects presently.
He added that attendees to
upcoming meetings can expect to
see very little, if any, "housekeep-
ing" legislation, such as changes
or additions to the compiled elec-
tion code or operating procedures
of meetings - all of which took
place last semester. Nonetheless,
he did say the election code could
be looked at again before the

March election.
The new year will also see the
introduction of stricter policies
for representative attendance.
From now on, representatives
will have to attend at least one
commission or committee meet-
ing per week outside of the
assembly meetings.
Not attending a commission
or committee meeting can result
in an unexcused absence. Repre-
sentatives are allowed six unex-
cused absences per semester or
they will be dismissed from their
position. Roll is called at the
start and end of each assembly
meeting.
"So, if someone were to be
inactive for two weeks, they
could be recalled," Proppe said.
Still, recording the attendance
at commission or committee
meetings will rely on an honor
system where representatives
will mark their attendance on a
Google Doc.
"I think that's a really impor-
tant part of being a CSG rep ...
being active outside of these
meetings," Proppe said.
CSG president Manish Parikh,
a business senior, said he has
been pleased with the atten-
dance of the assembly so far, but
noted-one instance when sparse

attendance nearly ended a meet-
ing before it started.
The assembly moved a meet-
ing thatwas originally scheduled
for the day of the presidential
election to the previous night.
Initial attendance at the meeting
was far below quorum, Parikh
said, but after assembly members
were frantically called to come to
the meeting, quorum was made
seconds before the cut-off time
so the meeting could be held.
CSG vice president Omar
Hashwi, an LSA junior, said he
remembered the night as well.
"This assembly is one that's
very dedicated to their busi-
ness because everybody had
something that they're doing at
the time that we called them,"
Hashwi said. "Some people just
ran from North Campus down to
Central just for this meeting."
Proppe said meeting efficien-
cy has been a goal.
"I think probably my legacy
as speaker will be going really
quickly through meetings," he
said. While Proppe said he aims
to keep meetings lasting two
hours, there is no official time
limit to meetings. He noted that
meetings last semester lasted
more than three-and-a-half
hours.


two months later where he gave
his famous "I Have a Dream"
speech. Ward noted that Detroi-
ters were proud that King iden-
tified his speech in Detroit as
a major part of the civil rights
movement.
Elizabeth James, a program
associate of Afroamerican and
African studies, said the audio
recordings were an essential
part of the event.
"We wanted to do something
where we let Dr. King speak,"
James said. "We wanted to hear
his voice."
Lumas Helaire, assistant
director of the Office of Aca-
demic Multicultural Initiatives,
said he enjoyed listening to the
slow style of speaking King used
in his speeches.
"He is saying stuff that, espe-
cially during that time, a lot of
people didn't say," Helaire said.
"It worked to his advantage that
he spoke so slowly because you

get caught up in waiting for the
next word."
"Your brain gets a chance to
process what he's saying, and he
brings you with him," he added.
Audience members were later
led around a room lined wall-to-
wall with blown up black and
white photos depicting Martin
Luther King's legacy and the
other events of the civil rights
movement. One wall was made
up of photos taken while King
was visiting the University in
1962.
Engineering freshman Dylan
Kane said the photos gave him
new insight into the events that
occurred during the civil rights
movement.
"It was interesting to see
some new perspectives I've
never seen before," Kane said.
"The professor was able to
provide some close insight on
exactly what was going on in
those pictures."

Purely partisan
Right-to-work and Pure Michigan don't mix
T he Pure Michigan logo has done great things for Michigan's
travel and tourism industry. However, to promote the fact
that Michigan is now a right-to-work state, the Michigan
Economic Development Corporation has attached the Pure Michi-
gan logo and brand with advertisements touting the passage of this
legislation. The branding was prominently displayed in a full-page
advertisement in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 8. The text of the
advertisement cites the legislation as a "once-in-a-generation trans-
formation (that) has Michigan poised to become a preferred place to
do business ... the perfect storm of opportunity, resources and passion
is Pure Michigan." While business opportunities in Michigan should
be promoted, MEDC should not have politicized Pure Michigan, a
brand solely dedicated to encouraging tourism.

The Pure Michigan brand started as an
advertising campaign in 2006, with the goal
of branding Michigan as a travel destina-
tion. Pure Michigan was created by Travel
Michigan, a division of the MEDC. MEDC is
a state-funded economic development corpo-
ration. While Travel Michigan does receive
funding from the MEDC, right-to-work has
no association to the Pure Michigan logo.
Under right-to-work laws, employees cannot
be forced to pay union dues in any work place.
Right-to-work was quickly passed in Decem-
ber without public hearings. In a December
poll, 51 percent of Michigan voters. did not
support this legislation. Right-to-work is a
polarizing issue in the state, and it's too soon
to determine whether or not it will bolster
economic activity.
The advertising decision completely chang-
es the meaning of the Pure Michigan brand
and sets a dangerous precedent. In 2011, the
MEDC reported that the Pure Michigan tour-
ism campaign generated $1 billion of revenue
for businesses in the state. This was accom-

plished without the mention of polarizing leg-
islation passed in Michigan. The addition of an
anti-union agenda to Pure Michigan could sti-
fle the tourism campaign when the two have
nothing to do with each other.
It's important- for Michigan to advertise
business opportunities. However, this can be
done without the use of specific, partisan leg-
islation. MEDC should focus on the Michigan
Business Tax, the educational opportunities
available and the vibrant cities Michigan has
to offer.
Although economic investment in Michi-
gan should be encouraged, branding right-
to-work as "Pure Michigan" as a potential
answer to this challenge is deeply misguided.
The decision abuses the bipartisan and uni-
fying nature of Pure Michigan by giving it a
political agenda and unfairly flaunts an image
of Michigan at the cost of the tourism indus-
try. In doing so, the advertising decision not
only taints the Pure Michigan brand, but also
uses taxpayer dollars to promote an unpopu-
lar and polarizing decision.

n the end, it boils down to
this: How many elbow patch-
es is too many?

sions? Let's HORTON
get serious -
can my actual
elbows be graft-
ed with patches? If so, could I be on
the reality show, "I Gave Up My Skin
For Suede," or star in an episode of
that long-running academic fashion
series, "Say Yes To The Tweed?" As
a new semester arrives - as I step in
front of a new class - how do I look
like I know what I'm doing?
It's my second year as a lecturer
in the English Department Writing
Program. Before that, I was a gradu-
ate student instructor. Before that,
a graduate student. Before that, an
undergraduate. As an undergradu-
ate, I looked forward to the first
day of a new term. I wasn't always
pleased to be back at school, but I
was thrilled to have at least one day
where nothing seemed required of
me. Sit, introduce myself, play some
terrible name-game, look over the
syllabus. Consider my schedule -
is a five-day weekend possible? Be
physically present in the room and
deal with everything else later. First
days are easy.
It is not, let me say, the same for
teachers.
The first day of class is huge. Let's
put aside for the moment the work
that's gone into the syllabus - plan-
ning four months of classes is like
squeezing all your worldly posses-
sions into a carry-on bag and then
jamming it wheels-first into an over-

head bin. When I enter and amble
to the front of the classroom, I must
introduce myself. The voice inside
my head says, be brief and be clear.
Explain your qualifications, your
background. Don't brag, but be con-
fident. Don't oversell yourself, don't
undersell the material. Be delightful
and welcoming and witty and acces-
sible. Do not rant about reality tele-
vision. Do not be an insane person.
Be perfect. No pressure.
Now ask members of the class to
introduce themselves. What ques-
tions beyond the obvious (name,
major, year in school, hometown)
allow a thoughtful and interesting
human being to appear thought-
ful and interesting? How can I ask
a group of strangers to share a part
.of themselves so soon - do I say it's
a leap of faith? I usually go simple,
asking for favorite books and mov-
ies. Harry Potter and anything
Channing Tatum prove big winners.
(What house, then, would suit Chan-
ning? My money's on Hufflepuff.)
Or I use the standard, I-give-you-a-
ticket-right-now-where-would-you-
like-to-go vacation query, where
Europe and warm islands always
do well, with Florida an honorable
mention. (And what-is the Michi-
gander obsession with Florida?)
After that, the easy part's over.
How do I begin to build a place where
everyone feels comfortable to share
their ideas, take intellectual and cre-
ative risks and trust their peers to
do the same? At this point, I'm just
praying I don't trip over myself, spill
coffee everywhere and collapse in a
weeping mass of damp tweed. I
Judging by the amount of advice
out there, I'm not the only teacher
mindful of first day dynamics.
Guidance from our own excellent
Center for Research on Learning
and Teaching includes the basics:
"Learn students' names and use
them ... Be expressive and enthusi-
astic ... Be open to helping students

with problems ... " The Center for
Teaching at vanderbilt University
notes that first days can be calendar
commodities: " ... several of your
students may be 'shopping' for a
schedule the first week of classes."
Carnegie Mellon University's first
day survival guide speaks directly
to me: "More formal attire commu-
nicates expertise and confidence,
less formal attire communicates
approachability." So then, a suit
jacket with jean shorts? Too
creepy? An expressive tuxedo with
enthusiastic pajama pants? Woody
Allen glasses and at least six intel-
lectual scarves?
A good class finds
itself, settles in,
grows together
I know there's no formula for
the perfect first class. A good class
finds itself, settles in, grows togeth-
er. I know first impressions aren't
everything but they are something.
We who survive Michigan winters
know better than most that ice can
be broken in a day, but it only melts
over months.
Suffice to say that I - and I sus-
pect many other teachers - care
deeply and sweat freely when pre-
paring for this first day, a day that
at its worst seems like equal parts
audition and open house. But the
day I'm not nervous, not excited,
not willing to try again is the day
I quit teaching. The stakes are too
high and the rewards too great to
do otherwise. First days matter.
Sorry, yes. A question in the back?
Well, that's kind of you to say. I do
have splendid elbows.

Funding to flourish

The value of a liberal arts education, partic-
ularlyone inthe humanities, is currentlyques-
tioned in the United States. What's in question
is not the contentofaliberal arts educationper
se, but rather its usefulness in society.
Just last October, Florida Gov. Rick Scott
expressed this concern to the Sarasota Her-
ald-Tribune.
"If I'm going to take money from a citi-
zen to put into education, then I'm going to
take that nroney to create jobs. So I want that
money to go to degrees where people can get
jobs in this state. Is it a vital interest of the
state to have more anthropologists? I don't
think so," he said.
Scott's remarks spark an interesting ques-
tion in political philosophy: What are the
vital interests of the state, and, more gener-
ally, of society? Surely, the promotion of eco-
nomic growth through investment in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics
education can be counted amongst those
interests. Another might be upholding the
rule of law, since this advances the objective
of security and civility that are necessary to
conduct business.
Economic growth, security and civility are
vital to the state because they're valuable in
promoting human flourishing. Human flour-
ishing, in all of its diverse and wonderful
forms, is the real goal of the state. We don't
create jobs for the sake of jobs, enforce laws
for the sake of laws or invest in technology
for the sake of technology. We do all of these
things for the sake of human flourishing.
With the goal of human flourishing in
mind, one might ask what a liberal arts edu-
cation has to offer. The answer is a world of
good. Activists, poets, playwrights, politi-
cians and artists trace the development of
their identities back to experiences in the
liberal arts. Where would Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. be without his engagement in theol-

ogy? How about David Foster Wallace, Ter-
rence Malick or Lawrence Lessig without
earlier immersion in philosophy? These are
people whose art and ideas enrich our lives
in ways beyond the discovery of theorems
or development of devices. These are people
whose output can't be measured in terms of
dollars, but in terms of their power to strike
at the very core of our being.
Of course, not every English major is the
next Arthur Miller or Susan Sontag. But this
doesn't mean every student of 19th century
French poetry or ancient philosophy is gam-
bling to become the next great literary theo-
rist or Plato scholar. Rather, the experience of
a liberal arts education lends itself to all kinds
of fields that require a broad-minded, human-
istic approach to one's life and career.
Skeptics may accept all the assertions
about the value of a liberal arts education
but continue to deny resources to these dis-
ciplines in a turbulent economy. However,
in terms of job prospects, the numbers don't
support the idea that a liberal arts degree is
significantly less viable in today's job market.
A recent study from Georgetown University
reports an unemployment rate of 9.27 percent.
for recent liberal arts graduates, compared to
a rate of 7.8 percent for STEM discipline grad-
uates. That's a difference of only 1.47 percent.
The idea that liberal arts majors don't find
jobs is pernicious and flat-out wrong.
We need to abandon the concept that we're
only worth what we've been taught in the
past and embrace an attitude that values the
person we may become in the future. Doing
so means changing our discourse surround-
ing the liberal arts. It means giving up our
obsession with how an art history major will
function in society and instead discovering
how she will flourish.

Justice failed for Swartz

4

The world is small, but the Inter-
net makes the world infinitely small-
er. This became even more apparent
to me when I learned of the recent
Jan. 11 suicide of Internet activist
Aaron Swartz. He was prosecuted
by the federal government for down-
loading nearly four-million articles
from the online academic journal
database, JSTOR, which charges
extremely high fees for scholarly,
articles. Unfortunately, the possi-
bility of a 35-year prison sentence
proved too much for Swartz to bear.
Swartz is a testament to the
importance of Internet freedom.
Despite his huge impact on the
Internet, he's much less famous than
Mark Zuckerberg, who's constantly
criticized for the ever-changing pri-
vacy settings of Facebook.
Swartz was a co-founder of
Reddit, a site where users post
thousands of articles, videos and
pictures with the hope that others
will find them of interest. Over this
past winter break, I became a more
active Reddit user, posting a couple
of links daily. While it was quite
humbling to realize that my humor
may not be consistent with the rest
of the world, I was reminded how
awesome it is to share and converse
with others in a society that's domi-
nated and funded by the wealthy -
an indisputable fact regardless of

party affiliation. Not to say we're
oppressed people, but the fact that
the government pursued Swartz for
trying to release documents that
arguably should have been public in
the first place is troubling.
The amazement generated by
websites like Reddit is where our
society's problems lie. Why should
sites like Reddit, which promote
the interaction of people, be consid-
ered a triumph? Shouldn't they be
an expectation?
I, like many others, spend a lot
of time on the Internet and have
noticed the huge influence of large
corporations cloudingthe web. Seri-
ously, how annoying is it to be forced
to watch a 45-second advertisement
in order to watch a one-minute
online video?
Of course, I didn't know Swartz;
however, I feel like he would've
hated big companies shelling out
millions of dollars to advertise, con-
sidering censorship would surely
follow suit. Swartz was also strongly
against the Stop Online Piracy Act
that galvanized national debate in
2012. When the bill was ultimately
shot down he said, "It was really
stopped by the people; the people
themselves - they killed the bill
dead." It was clear then that Swartz
valued the power of the masses and
the ability the Internet has to rally

everyone together.
Glenn Greenland of The Guard-
ian summed up the significance of
Swartz's life and the state of our
society nicely in a Jan. 12 article.
He said, "Swartz was destroyed
by a justice' system that fully pro-
tects the most egregious criminals
as long as they are members of or
useful to the nation's most powerful
factions, but punishes with incom-
parable mercilessness and harsh-
ness those who lack power and, most
of all, those who challenge power."
I had never heard of Swartz
before his death. At first the only
reason I found it of interest was
because I like the website he helped
create. But after reading more about
him I learned that he's considered a
modern day civil rights activist who
fought hard for the sanctity and
purity of the Internet. He cherished
the public good and remains impor-
tant despite his lack of fame.
What needs to be taken away
from his life, however, is that we
should not take our freedom, espe-
cially on the Internet, for.granted.
Because the reality is that there are
people out there who are trying to
take it away from us. The Internet
connects people - we need to keep
it that way.

Kahane to join
yMusic in concert

UMS to present
collaborative
musical ensemble
By LENA FINKEL
DailyArts Writer
In a pit stop on the way to the
group's first tour, yMusic will be
accompanying friend and musi-
cian Gabriel
Kahane. A self- Gabriel
proclaimed Kahane
"classical
chamber music yMusic
ensemble,"
yMusic first Thursday and
formed in 2001 Fridayat 7:30
when multi- Arthur Miller
instrumental Theatre
musicians
Rob Moose, $35
CJ Cameri-
eri, Alex Sopp,
Hideaki Aomori and Nadia
Sirota joined forces. According
to violinist and guitarist Rob
Moose, the group came together
with the intention of being "an
auxiliary" to other artists.
Moose, 30, explained, "We
thought we had a nice balance of
style backgrounds and wanted
to show other sides of what our
instruments could do."
The ensemble reached its
current personnel in 2010 when
cellist Clarice Jenson - who,
according to Moose, seemed to
be "destined to be in the group"

- joined the band.
Though all members attend-
ed traditional conservatories,
yMusic has strayed from its
classical roots. Most recently,
the group performed with indie
rock band Dirty Projectors and
will do so again on Jan. 21 in
Sydney.
The group has also worked
with musicians Shara Worden,
Son Lux and of course, Gabriel
Kahane.
Moose first met Kahane in
2007 through a mutual friend
when Kahane was playing solo
and looking to work with other
musicians.
Kahane himself is aasinger,
songwriter, pianist, guitar-
ist and composer and has per-
formed with Sufjan Stevens and
Rufus Wainwright. His most
recent album Where are the
Armsachieved critical acclaim
from The New York Times,
which said the album "conveys
emotional intelligence."
Kahane has since written
the composition "For the Union
Dead" exclusively for the sex-
tet. Based on the similarly titled
book of poems by Robert Lowell,
the 35-minute piece consists of
nine movements and was one of
the first pieces ever written for
yMusic.
Moose called it "one of the
most underperformed pieces"
and said they plan on playing
part of the composition for their
performance at the Arthur Mill-

er Theatre on Thursday and Fri-
day night.
Moose and the rest of yMusic
will also play selections from the
ensemble's debut album Beauti-
ful Mechanical, while Kahane
will perform songs from Where
are the Arms with accompani-
ment from the ensemble, as well
as a solo set he called "piano
karaoke."
Following the Ann Arbor
performance, yMusic will move
on to Minneapolis and Cincin-
nati and then on to a mini-tour
in Sydney, while Kahane will
continue his U.S. tour in cities
including Evanston, New York
and Washington, D.C.
Despite the two parting
ways, Moose insisted that this
wouldn't be the end of yMusic's
collabtration with Kahane.
"We are constantly evolving
and are creating better and bet-
ter outputs and it's really excit-
ing to do that with a friend and
peer. We are really looking for-
ward to continue to work with
him," Moose explained.
He called Kahane "one of the
most talented people (he has)
ever worked with."
After the group's Sydney
tour, yMusic will return to the
studio in March to work on a
new albumto be released in fall
2013.
Kahane's U.S. tour will end in
late April with his performance
at Carnegie Hall with the
Orpheus Chamber Orchestra.

FAT POSSUM
Man, I'm really overdue for a manicure "
Without Girls, Christopher
Owens grows up too fast

By KATIE STEEN
Daily Music Editor
Last July, when Christopher
Owens announced he was leaving
the. band Girls, he cited personal
reasons. With
the release of .
his solo album
Lysandre this Lysandre
week, it's clear
that Owens Christopher
has held up on Owens
his promise of Fat Possum
keeping things
personal.Lysan-
dre feels sort of like you're read-
ing his diary, or maybe a Twitter
feed full of cryptic updates of his
daily life (@Chri55yBaby, if you're
curious). It's super earnest, with
undeniable moments of beauty,
but unfortunately overwhelm-
ingly unremarkable.
Lysandre is named after a
French woman with whom
Owens had an affair - odd, given
that his girlfriend Hannah Hunt
sings backup on several tracks.
The album starts off with "Lysan-
dre's Theme," a 38-second-long,
flute-filled lullaby that is aggra-
vatingly peaceful.
This theme appears repeatedly
in various forms of instrumenta-
tion - it shows up in "Here We
Go," then again in "New York
City," and in "A Broken Heart,"
and also "Here We Go Again"
and, finally, in "Riviera Rock."
Yes, it gets annoying. Yes, it feels
gimmicky. Then it mysteriously
vanishes for two songs, only to
reappear in "Closing Theme,"
which is essentially a slightly juic-
ier "Lysandre's Theme."

Daily Arts Writer "Ohm," the six-minute album the very end. "The Point of It,"


Adam DeVine
discusses balance
between work, play
By STEVEN TWEEDIE
" Daily TV/New Media Editor
The third season of "Worka-
holics" returns tonight, and with
jt comes more feats of stupid-
ity from Adam DeVine ("Better
Off Ted"), Blake Anderson.("5th
"Year") and Anders Holm ("Key
and Peele").
Recently renewed for its fourth
,and fifth seasons; "Workaholics"
has propelled itself to flagship
status on Comedy Central, mostly
due to its wild popularity among
college students.
Inaninterview with The Mich-
igan Daily, DeVine, Anderson and
Holm spoke about partying with
the Black Keys, their upcoming
cameos in "Arrested Develop-
ment" and why you should tune
in for tonight's new episode of
"Workaholics."
It's no secret the guys like to
party, but DeVine - who recently

starred as Bumper inthe hit musi-
cal comedy "Pitch Perfect"-- was
quick to mention that it might not
be humanly possible to party as
hard as their onscreen counter-
parts ... because they'd be dead.
That doesn't keep them from
bumping into new fans and enjoy-
ing themselves, as DeVine men-
tioned was the case when they
met the Black Keys.
"They're one of my favorite
bands," DeVine said. "Dan espe-
cially, the lead singer, he's such a
huge 'Workaholics' fan. So when
they come in town sometimes,
they invite us out, and we get to go
party with them like we're huge
arena rock stars."
Even with all the revelry, the
"Workaholics" guys still know
how to get down to business,
with a movie script written and
produced with Seth Rogen in the
works and an upcoming cameo
in the much-anticipated new sea-
son of "Arrested Development,"
the latter of which made waves
around Twitter.
"It was Day 1 of shooting the
new season, so everyone was
pretty amped," DeVine said. "And

Jason Bateman didn't know who
we were. He thought we were just
actors hired for this small part.
"So he took a photo and
tthen posted it on his Twitter,"
he continued. "And Twitter
just exploded, like 'Oh my god
the 'Workaholics' guys are on
'Arrested Development'!' and
he came over to us and was like
'Wait, who are you guysT'"
And it looks like their cameos
on "Arrested Development" will
highlight what DeVine, Ander-
son and Holm are best at: acting
out thicker, stupider versions of
themselves.
"I play a ticket-taker for an
airline," DeVine said. "So I'm
delving out the tickets and I'm
just totally inept. I'm just an
idiot, and the other guys work
for the airline as well."

Being labeled a "critic's band"
is usually indicative of a few
things. One is that the band
will be artistic,
adventurous
and voracious
in its experi- Fade
mentation. The
other is that Yo La Tengo
they will prob- Matador
ably be under-
appreciated, if
not unpopular. Yo La Tengo, the
old man river of '90ts o-fi, defi-
nitely falls into that category.
Making consistently enjoy-
able music for almost three
decades now, Yo La Tengo has
mastered its art, and the level
of comfort is evident on Fade,
its newest release. The group's
13th album is an authentic and
well-executed collection of

opener, epitomizes the album's
theme of accepting life's unicer-
tainty with its first two lines:
"Sometimes the bad guys go right
on top / Sometimes the good
guys lose." It isn't a defeatist
couplet, but rather an acknowl-
edgment that, sometimes, shit
goes wrong. Sometimes the
Lions go 10-6, sometimes they-
go 4-12, and there's nothing
you can do about it. Throughout
Fade, Yo La Tengo, which trans-
lates to "I have it" in Spanish,
does seem to have it. The album
is an even-keeled existentialist
anthem, recalling the unortho-
dox Zen of Jeff Lebowski.
The opening track is followed
by "Is That Enough," a country-
western ditty dedicated to what
sounds likea rather disagreeable
ex. Half "I'm glad you dumped
me" and half "sour grapes," "Is

Fade's final track, is Kaplan's
wise answer to the implied ques-
tion, "What's the point?" In what
is undoubtedly a love song to his
wife and fellow band mate Geor-
gia Hubley, Kaplan softly sings,
"If we're getting old / If we're
not so strong / If our story's told
/ That's the point of it," over
slowly building chords. Kaplan
opens Fade with thoughts about
the inherent unfairness tof the
world, but ends with the belief
that everything will be just fine.

This year, he has just five.,
"I'm not going to point the
finger at anyone," Guptill said.
"That's my fault. I've got to get
in front more and battle harder
to get there. The power play's
been a big issue, and we need to
sort that out in the weeks com-
ing forward."
Berenson said that he hoped
in the preseason that Guptill,
who has yet to score a power-
play goal, would continue to
provide the net-front presence
he demonstrated last year and
that other new scorers around
the crease would emerge. But
that hasn't been the case.
"The one thing Guptill had
going for him was a pretty good
track record from last year,"
Berenson said. "And he was
good in front of the net - he'd tip
in goals, he'd find loose pucks,
rebounds and bury them. And
this year, that's not happening."
With the power play convert-
ing at an abysmal 12.9-percent
clip, it's not fair to believe that
all of the unit's struggles would
dissolve if Guptill - or another
scorer - began tallying those
dirty goals. But it would make
a sizeable dent, and could spark
an offense that's looked lethar-
gic for most of this season.

Daily Sports Editor
Twenty-one points is no small

on the road. But the fact that the
No. 5 Michigan men's basketball
team was a bounce. of the ball
away from taking a last-second.
lead against No. 11 Ohio State in
its 56-53 loss on Sunday is a testa-
ment to how good the team can
be, when it shows up.
This was a tale of two halves,
and the Wolverines can't allow
this to become a common occur-
rence. Lackluster defense will
lead to double-digit deficits, but
Michigan won't be able to assem-
ble a comeback every time. As
much firepower as the Wolverines
possess on the offensive end, per-
haps their greatest strength can
be their defense, which showed
how necessary it is to this team.
"I think for the majority of
the second half, we played well,"
sophomore guard Trey Burke said
after Sunday's loss. "We should
have played the way we played in
the second half, in the first half."
That much is clear: Michigan's
offense might not have been able
to do much of anything in the
first half, but the defense was
where the mess started. During
a 10-minute span in the middle
of the first stanza, the Buckeyes
scored 25 points on 10-of-12
shooting from the field.
Michigan's defense was medi-
ocre at best during most of the
first half, allowing Ohio State to
beat it off the dribble while clos-
ing too slowly on the perimeter.
The Wolverines were unable to
do anything right on that side of
the ball. They conceded 34 points,
allowing Ohio State to shoot 52
percent from the field, including
4-of-9 from beyond the arc.
They showed no sign of the
defense that allowed just 47
points on 34-percent shooting in
their 62-47 win against Nebraska
last week.
"We got very, very excited

about this opportunity and got out
and probably challenged defen-
sively a little too much away from
our base defense," said Michigan
coach John Beilein.
But with just over three min-
utes left in the first stanza, Michi-
gan showed a glimpse of whythey
are one of the best teams in the
country. After a 3-pointer from
Ohio State forward Deshaun
Thomaswidened the gap to 34-15,
the Wolverines clamped down on
defense.
Blocks from freshman forward
Mitch McGary and Burke cre-
ated fastbreak opportunities on
offense. Spanning the two peri-
ods, Michigan held the Buckeyes
scoreless for more than five min-
utes.
Following halftime, the Wol-
verines continued what they
started. Alternating between a
zone and man-to-man defensive
scheme, they controlled the con-
test the rest of the way on the
defensive end.
Ohio State point guard Aaron
Craft, who had tallied seven
points and two assists in the first
half, produced just two points and
two assists in the final 20 min-
utes, including a 0-for-4 show-

ing from the field. As a team, the
Buckeyes scored just 22 points
in the final stanza, shooting less
than 35 percent from the fioorand
1-of-6 from downtown. Michigan
also had all five of its blocks in the
final 23 minutes, including two
each from McGary and Burke:
"Before we went to zone, I
thinly we tried to hug the perim-
eter too much and tried to take
away their perimeter shooting,"
Burke said.
But most impressive was Mich-
igan's defense in the final min-
utes. Falling behind 52-46 after a
Thomas layup with just over four
minutes remaining in the game,
the Wolverines didn't allow a field
goal the rest of the contest - the
Buckeyes sank four free throwsin
the final 12 seconds. They forced
four of their eight second-half
takeaways in the final three min-
utes, scoring four points off turn-
overs.
Though it' was a tale of two
halves for the defense, Beilein
stayed positive about the over
exuberance duringthe first half.
"I like having guys that have
the big hearts, and a lot of cour-
age, that want to go out there and
get after them," Beilein said.

As the ponds freeze,
rowing moves indoors

By BO BRADARICH
Daily Sports Writer
The cool Ann Arbor air has set-
tled, and the grey world is upon us
once. again. With Belleville Lake
freezing over, this can only mean
one thing for the Michigan wom-
en's rowing team: winter training.
For those of you not familiar
with the sport of rowing, the win-
ter season is the time when row-
ers move indoors to train on the
ergometers - a machine manu-
factured to simulate that of the
rowing motion in a boat - in the
Intramural Building. It is crucial
to the advancement of rowers
who are forced to train in cooler
climates, and one with which
all rowers inevitably establish a
peculiar relationship. The winter
season is the most critical time
of the year because it is during
this period of brutal training and
unparalleled commitment that
champions are made.
Winter training is like trying
to find heaven in hell. Michigan
coach Mark Rothstein has estab-
lished a rigorous training pro-
gram for his team over the years,
usinghis 16 years of experience to
tweak and perfect its intricacies.
It consists of weightlifting,
core strength development,
cross-training and above all, 8-10
hours per week of training on the
ergometer. It's a strenuous and
taxing commitment, but the team
knows it's required ofthemifthey
want to win.
When rowing, the biggest chal-
lenge is not physical, but mental.
Every rower has the physical
capability to finish their workout,
but the challenge is activating the
mental capacity to finish strong.
The ergometer presents itself as a
distinctive test of self-will. Every

MASTER OF ARTS IN
NEW ARTS JOURNALISM
The School of the Art Institute of Chicago's (SAIC) Master of Arts in
New Arts Journalism program reinterprets and transforms the skills of a
traditional journalist into the multitasking demands of a contemporary arts
journalist where art writing, editing, and design skills are intertwined.
Unlike journalism schools that add an arts emphasis, SAIC is a vibrant
school of art and design in which New Arts Journalism students
can combine the in-depth study of arts and journalism, and work
closely with artists, art historians, and cultural critics.

Nine weeks in Kuwait
by Dana Del Vecchio

T he call to prayer from surround-
ing mosques and the sight of burgas
worn in 120-degree weather was
quite a culture shock to say the least. I spent
nine weeks in Kuwait City as an outsider last
summer and expected to blog daily about
my exposure to the Muslim world. What I
did not expect was to learn a life lesson in
friendship.
The economy of Kuwait relies heavily on
migrant workers from Sri Lanka, Pakistan
and India to do the jobs that natives find
undesirable. Tensions between these ethnic
groups are exacerbated by a common alien-
ation from the Kuwaiti people.
One illustration of the cultural divide is
the "Old Souq," the city market where dates,
prayer beads and incense are sold. I watched
a group of migrant men in orange jump suits
with dismal expressions on their faces push
around shopping carts for the Kuwaiti shop-
pers. These men were clearly considered to
be a lower status or value.
Defying the idea that there is a "single
story" to every migrant worker - money
sent home, poor working conditions and
the inability to fit in - a dear friend of
mine working as a concierge in Kuwait City
humanized the condition and illustrated the
power of unconditional compassion.
During the last week of the summer
course, I decided to find a five-week intern-
ship in Kuwait to delay my departure and
familiarize myself with the country. Little

did I know, I would be driven to work by my
most informative resource and soon-to-be
good friend, Sunil Wickramabala.
Our exchanges were always the highlight
of my day, and our conversations gradually
revealed his unparalleled compassion for
others. Sunil had an incredible commitment
to his job, family and friends. His ability to
balance all three, along with the.burden of
stigmatization, asa migrant worker, was tre-
mendous.
One morning, Sunil's swollen eyelids
made it clear that something was wrong.
When we arrived at the site of the intern-
ship, he parked the car and slowly began to
expose his past months' experiences.
. Typically, Sunil worked the nightshift
from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Once he was off, he
drove his wife to work, then his daughter
to class at 7:30 a.m., and finally me to work
by 9 a.m. He then picked up his wife and
daughter at 2 p.m. and dropped them both
at home, drove an hour, arrived at my office
by 5pm and restarted his routine all over
again.
Sunil kept to his usual schedule like
any other working man - until June 19th.
On that day, Nalu, Sunil's good Sri Lankan
friend who worked as a construction work-
er for a Kuwaiti family, lost all recollection
of his friends, family and former life after a
bad fall. In addition to his other obligations,
Sunil began to pay daily visits to his hospi-
talized friend.

For Nalu, Sunil's friendship was invalu-
able, particularly since Nalu lived in the
country alone. Before the incident, Nalu
visited Sunil's family weekly and kissed
both of his two daughters on the forehead
each time.
"I was introduced to him when a group
of us met on our day off every week," Sunil
said. "After (I knew) where the house was,
I would go to his home and he would come
to mine."
If both men were living in Sri Lanka, race
would have segregated Sunil from Nalu.
As defined by the 30-year civil war in Sri
Lanka, the Tamil people are enemies of the
Sinhalese people. But ethnic tensions never
prevented these two from friendship for 28
years.
"I don't see him as Tamil, and us Sri.
Lankan. We have (a) friendship."
But after the unexpected fall, Nalu was
hospitalized. By the second day, he had
slipped into a coma.
"He could not open his eyes, and his
words did not make sense. We called his
family, and they were crying, saying, 'Please
try to send him to Sri Lanka,"' Sunil said.
For almost two weeks, Sunil and his fam-
ily became Nalu's surrogate family. They
came to his room at the hospital as a family
each afternoon.
on the morning of July 1, Sunil walked
into Nalu's room and found nothing more
than a blank-faced nurse and an empty bed.

" ... One day I went there and the nurse
said, 'Please bring shampoo.' On the sec-
ond day, I took the shampoo and I went
there and I saw (that) the bed was empty,"
Sunil said. "I asked her, 'Sister, where is this
guy?"'
Within one week, Nalu's bankcard was
canceled, his family and employer noti-
fied of his death, the Sri Lankan embassy
informed and his body sent to Sri Lanka.
For Sunil, dedication to his family and
commitment to his friend is never ques-
tioned.
"I'm not thinking I have to sleep,"-Sunil
said. "Sometimes, when I'm going to (the)
temple, they say, if you're eating something
and someone comes to your door, don't turn
to the other side."
Naturally, Sunil-hopes that that the same
kindness would be bestowed on him in a
similar situation.
"I give as much as I can give. What I have
is not all money, expect I can give a little.
If something happens to me, maybe some of
the people will do the same for me."
The image I held of my experience in
Kuwait pre-departure encompassed an
appreciation for Islam and daily interac-
tions with Kuwaitis, but my experience
ended up being significantly more. I will
remember it by the lesson of unconditional
friendship between strangers in a foreign
place.

a love letter byteresamathew ann arbor affairs: old testament love by teresamathew

W e all have love stories - romantic, platonic, heartbreaking or
heartwarming. No one has lived a life devoid of love or at least
one or two great stories about it. Ann Arbor Affairs is a new, monthly
rotating feature in the Statement, based off of both the Modern Love
column in the New York Times and LAAffairs in the LA Times. These
stories can relate to anything concerning love for and in Ann Arbor.
If you have a story of a terrible date, a long-lasting romance or how
much you love your dog, send it in. Submissions can be emailed to
teamathew@gmail.com. Even if your love life has less intrigue than
your calculus textbook (but just as many complex variables), chances
are you have a story to tell. And if, like me, you have no substantial love
life to speak of at the moment, just follow the advice handed down to
budding authors everywhere: write aboutwhat you know. So here is
the first Ann Arbor Affairs column, penned by yours truly about my
long-suffering pining for Jewish boys. We hope you enjoy it.
Join the . alfl
Come to our Mass Meetings!
Wednesday, January 16 at 7:30 P.M.
Sunday, January 20 at 7:30 P.M.
Thursday, January 24 at 7:30 P.M.
All meetings are in our newsroom at 420
Maynard Street, behind Betsy Barbour and
Newberry Halls.

I was 14 when I fell for my first
Jewish boy. Granted, he was over
twice my age and I'd never actu-
ally met him, but what liberal,
politically aware teenager hasn't
had a crush on Jon Stewart? And
it wasn't just a passing fancy -
oh no, it was a trend. For years
I would find myself attracted to
actors who just so happened to
be Jewish.
As Mindy Kaling so astutely
put it, "I, like the rest of the
North American world, have a
fondness for witty, East Coast-
y, over-educated, well-dressed
Jewish guys." I couldn't pinpoint
it exactly - there was just some-
thing about the dark curls, intel-
lectualism and knowledge of the
Old Testament that spoke to me.
I was not sure if this was a real-
ity or a result of watching far too
much Aaron Sorkin-produced
television. It certainly didn't help
that I went to an all-girls high
school and didn't know how to
interact with boys - Jewish or
otherwise. When I was asked

for my type, I would chuckle
awkwardly before sheepishly
responding, "Um...Jewish?"
I am very clearly Indian. I am
also Catholic. People were con-
fused.
It made sense to me, though.
Indians and Jews have a lot in
common: We come from cultures
that are highly community-
oriented, we prioritize education
and the highest achievement
in either of our societies will
probably forever be becoming
a doctor. I still remember my
Jewish friend telling me a joke
about how, at a hypothetical
Jewish president's inauguration,
his mother turned to the sena-
tor next to her and proudly said,
"You should see my other son.
He's a doctor."
I understood. The happiest day
in my mother's life was when I
told her I was taking college cal-
culus, and she's still hoping I'll
come to my senses and abandon
Norton Anthologies for medical
journals. And then there's the
fact that I used to read the Old
Testament for fun as a kid, back
when I had a comic book Bible.
Esther was my favorite character,
and when I learned that there

was an entire Jewish holiday
dedicated to her, it seemed like
just one more reason to become
Hasidic-ally enamored. And
while people keep telling me that
the best way to meeting a nice
Jewish boy is to go to Hillel, I
can't help but feel that the ones
in attendance there are more
concerned with meeting nice
Jewish girls than trying to figure
out if the Indian girl in the cor-
ner is attempting to be a shiksa.
After coming to Ann Arbor and
actually interacting with Jew-
ish boys, I've reconsidered my
position somewhat. I have yet
to meet any boys with curly hair
and soulful eyes who have made
me want to willingly abandon the
freedom to eat cheese and meat
in tandem. Just as I'm not Aish-
warya Rai, not every Jewish boy
is going to look like Adam Brody
and have the wit of Aaron Sorkin.
Stereotypes, shockingly, are not
always an accurate portrayal of
an entire group of people. Who
knew? Maybe the specific Jewish
guys that Kaling describes are
like unicorns or manic-pixie-
dream girls - ideals created by
the media and our own imagina-
tions.
Or maybe I'm just in love with
Jon Stewart after all.

SA sophomore Jeremy Jones updates
his Twitter daily. Within his 22,763
tweets, he comments on everything
from his new economics class to the first
birthday of Beyoned and Jay-Z's baby, Blue
Ivy.
Over winter break, Jeremy receid a
tweet from @umich, the Universit
account. In response to his tweet aI I

responded: "We're ready for you! Hope y)u're
enjoying your break."
"Being that that's our school, it shows that
they are really connected and unified their
students through social media," Joe sad
"I'm really happy that my school actially
views my tweets and actually knowis what'
going on."
Jones received responses from the Univ
sity's Twitter account two additional times as
well.
With different Tumbir, YouTube, Face
book, 'Twitter, Instragran and LinkedIn
accounts, Jeremy said he esta blished his
social media presence "to have a voice." -
As one of hundreds of millions of people
flocking to these social media platforms, Jer-
emy recognizes his new place in the global
conversation through social media.
Creating an off-campus, online
campus community
Social media, more specifically Twit-
ter, creates a quasi-Greek agora, or gather-
ing space, for the modern world, according
to Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, a University
alum who spoke at Rackham Auditorium in
November.
"\e once again start to see multiple per-
spectives on a particular news story or event
that's happening," Costolo said i)is presen-
tation. "We once again start to have a shared
experience cross the globe about what's hap-
pening and what we're viewing now. We once
again get ai unfiltered perspective of what's
happening. But. at the sanei tme, it comple-
ments all t hese traditional formis of broadcast
media."
With easily accessible forums, like Tsvit-
ter and other social media platforms, people
can witness and express reactions, personal
thoughts and beliefs with a clickl of the mouse
or a tap of the finger. With Tubir, Face-
book,tPinterestmanddseveral twitter accounts,
amongothersocial mcdasplatforms, the Uni-
versity attempts to keep iup with this techno-
logical trend.
To manage thisnewi, social media venture,
the University hired Jordan Miller to ful-
fill the new director of social media position
last Fcbruary. But Miller working under
Lisa Rudgers, the vice imesident for global
cOiimmissiiiications and strategic initiatives
resigned in December uinder alegations that
parts of her resume had been falsified.
Prior to Iser resignation, Miller sutd ini a

by Jen

the University as a national leader in the use
of social media.
"In the same way that the University is a
top school in so many other ways, we canand

Josh Pasek, an .assistint professor swho

In a blg post on Jan. 14, Rudgers exam-

In an e-mail Rushton wrote to Rudgers
in December after Miler resigned, he wrote
that Miller was someone lie called for "ideas
and suggestions" while she was at the Univer-
sity.
"I'm sorry for the loss, some of our group
members emailed me about it today," the
e-mail said."My heartsank, for both ofyou."

to advertise, according to Rushton. ie began,

only, staff member to manage Louisville's
Twitter and Facebook account. Similarly to
Miller's former post, Rushton controls the
social media environment at Louisville.
Before he began the position, Louisville
depended on the deans of certain depart-
ments and schools to create their social
media. Rushton stepped in to control Louis-
ville's social media as awhole.
"I am an army of one," Rushton said while
describing his position. He added that other
universities, including some Ivy Leagues,
usually only involve one person to take con-
trol of social media.
How did we miss this?
"Why did you not verify Jordan Miller's
educational credentials when she applied for
the $100,000 salary director of social media
position? ... Will you verify the education cre-
dentials for your next hire for this position?"
Patrick Host, a freelance higher educa-
tion reporter based in D.C., e-mailed Rudgers
these questions, among others, after Miller's
resignation about the details surroundingher
hiring in early 2012.
At the University, each new job opening is
posted sn umjobs.org where applicants sub-
mit hei resumes and basic application mate-
rials according to University spokesman
lick Fitzgerald. Though each department
nd specihe position undergoes a unique
interview and employment process, they all
involve a background check.
When asked ihow the University may have
missed Milr' IIls statenment that she has
a diploma o r r -zgerald saidhis
was "a very unusual set of circtmstance. This
doesn't happen often at alI."
Fitzgerald said in an earlier interviewi that
the University plans to post the position in
the near future. Ilowever, ht said there are
no anticipated changes t: tohe process of back-
ground checking.
Social media as a truth teller
While social media allowed Miller tio give
a voice to the University communuisit, ulti-
Icately ancthervotie spke backto revelh the
fllbehoodfhresume.
The Internet operated as its own "back-
ground check," displaying the power of an
online voice as Miller resigned after the alle-
gations.
Prof. Pasek said the accessibility of social
media leads to both accurate and false iifor-
mation.
"What you get looking at a social media
stream is some really accurate stuff that you
might pick up anywhere else, as well as a
bunch of things that are really inaccurate,"
Pasek said.
But the irony in Reddit exposing a social
media director's mistake shows how the

As she spoke, Paige recalled how her
drinking escalated. She remembers when
she had her first blackout - where she was
and the less-than-pleasant conditions in
an unknown place when she woke up. She
sees the times when she tried to control
her drinking by limiting her consumption
to only one type of alcohol and she knows
when she reached the point where nearly
every drinking occasion meant blacking
out.
"In Greek life, you just assume blacking
out was normal and drinking alot was nor-
mal," Paige said. "It's kind of interesting
to look back because it's like, 'What was I
thinking?"'
While at school, Paige would compare
her drinking habits to her friends and
believed she was not addicted to alcohol
because they were drinking more than her.
"People tried to confront me about it and
I would just be like 'No, I don't have a prob-
lem, I'm just drinking like everyone else
does,"' Paige said.
Jake, continued to drink while watching
his relationship with his parents deterio-
rate.
"Early in my senior year of high school,
I had a major blow up with them, and I left
home," Jake said. "Then about two days
later I said to my mom, 'I think I need to
go to treatment.' That was December 2 of
2010, and that was the first time I entered
treatment."
After he ended treatment in April, he
relapsed in June. He said he started to
build resentment towards peers who didn't
have to worry about sobriety.
When he started using drugs and alcohol
again, his parents offered an ultimatum:
He couldn't attend school at the University
in the fall if he continued using.
"I didn't care, and I kept using," Jake
said.
Because he continued using, he went to
treatment again, this time at a wilderness
program in North Carolina.
"It was enjoyable in a sense, but at the
same time it kind of got me centered and
realize what I needed to do," Jake said.
Jake then came to Ann Arbor and spent
his first semester at Washtenaw Commu-
nity College before enrolling at the Univer-
sity for the winter semester.
In Ann Arbor, Jake lived in two different
three-quarter houses - houses for people
transitioning from treatment back to "nor-
mal" life.
After his first semester at the University
was over, Jake briefly encountered drugs
again - a relapse that put his life at risk.
"About three weeks after the semester
ended, I took this deep sigh of relief (feel-
ing) like I got through the school year
clean and sober," Jake said. "I had about
11 months sober and then I kind of forgot
what I was doing and forgot that recovery

and staying sober is a 24/7, 365-type deal,
and I went back out and used."
He drove to Detroit to buy drugs and
woke up after overdosing surrounded in
vomit with a bruised face.
"That was a very scary time because it
seemed like a good idea, and-for that to
seem like a good idea seems ludicrous.to
anybody but an alcoholic and an addict,"
Jake said. "The amount I used should kill
any human being. A lot of people were
shocked that I didn't die."
Paige reached her breaking point last
summer when she left a party in nearby
Saline and crashed her car.
But she doesn't remember this.
She can't tell me how her car crashed
and at the time she didn't know where she

interventions ... and those are all effective
if one continues with them," Zucker said.
"They may not be one's particular cup of
tea (and it) doesn't seem to fit, but if one
sees that one of these resolutions is not
working, one needs to look for something
else because there are other options avail-
able. When one is significantly addicted,
self-help often does not work."
After going back and forth between
drug use and treatment, Jake said that
his most recent time using drugs caused a
major change in his mindset and that has
made him recommitted to stay clean and
sober.
"That was a huge realization for me,"
Jake said. "I came to a point where I, for
the first time in my life, really felt like I

"We know a couple things, that one
thing won't work so you have to do a series
of interventions" with evidence-based
strategies, Desprez said.
Zucker added that because college offers
a more "at-risk" environment for drinking,
universities offer different options to com-
bat drinking issues, with some programs
working better than others.
"If you look at the data, there's a tre-
mendous amount of variation with some
schools still very clearly being party
schools, where it's likely also that the,
alumni and the administration don't
take a heavy stance about controlling it,"
Zucker said. "Then there's schools who
take it more seriously, who have alternative
activities on football nights that don't involve
drinking or arrange transportation and gen-
erally raise awareness of the risk that's asso-
ciated with this."
The student life survey, which is compiled
from a random sample of students at the
University every two years, shows that every
year since 2005 - a year when binge drink-
ing at the University hit its all-time high of
53.2 percent - it has decreased.
One effort to decease drinking at the Uni-
versity is the "Stay in the Blue" harm-preven-
tion campaign started in the fall of 2006.
"(The Stay in the Blue campaign) helps
people attach a (blood alcohol content) level
to a level of low risk," Desprez said.
Marsha Benz, health educator for alcohol
and other drugs, was one of the primary peo-
ple involved with initiating the campaign.
Last spring, she said a big factor in making
the campaign successful was including stu-
dents in the process.
This year's data, which was released with
the 2011 student life survey results, shows
the binge drinking prevalence number is the
lowest it has been in over 10 years, at 44.7
percent. The lowest percentage previously
reported was 45 percent in 1999.
Like Paige, Jake seldom mentioned
being scared while using drugs. The only
time Jake explicitly referred to his experi-
ences as being scary was when he traveled
to Detroit and overdosed. He said usually
he wasn't scared about using drugs.
"The two favorable options were to
finally realize I can finally live a life clean
or to not have to be in that misery any-
more," Jake said. "So it didn't seem so
bad in the moment to use those drugs and
alcohol and think 'Well, maybe if I wasn't
here anymore, it'd be better than being
miserable.' But you realize after the haze'
clears, that that's a crazy thought and that
you shouldn't think like that, but in the
moment you're not really afraid of it. At
least I wasn't."
To say it was easy to listen to the things
they've already gone through in their still-
young lives would be a lie. Paige and Jake,
both sober and clean now, kept saying they
were lucky - lucky to have the resources to
already be in recovery - and that was the
most hopeful outlook I could find for the .
problem of underage addiction and addic-
tion in general.

own college experience could be widely dis-
similar, their stories both share a theme:
Paige and Jake are both in recovery from
alcoholism and addiction.
And they're not alone in their addiction,
but are more of an anomaly for seeking
recovery. According to the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 19 per-
cent of college students are either abusive or
dependent on alcohol. And of that 19 percent,
only 5 percent seek treatment. '
"When you're in college, the penalties for
heavy use are not great because if you wake
up and you're too hung over to attend class,
you can get away with it or if you screw up
on an exam you can get away with it," Psy-
chology Prof. Robert Zucker, director of the
University's Addiction Research Center, said.
"But if you show up at work and you're acting
this way, you immediately have a problem.
Those are the kinds of external factors which
lead one to decrease use."
Zucker - who oversees the center's both
social and scientific research regarding
addiction - said research is still being con-
ducted to determine whether or not effects
from addiction are permanent.
"We know the brain is undergoing major
developmental changes between the ages
of about 12 and 25," Zucker said. "So if one
is drinking very heavily or has other drug
involvement, if that leaves some kind of
permanent residualdamages that does not
repair itself afterwards, we don't have the
answer to that yet. It's a very important
question"
For students, it will be a very important
answer.
I turned to Paige and Jake to puta voice to
the data that taunts us in the news: "drinking
amongst students increases," "binge drink-
ing reaches new high," "university presidents
call for lower drinking age." I knew that
Paige and Jake struggled with addiction

when I met them, but the specifics I couldn't
have imagined. So I asked them for their
stories.
"Can we start at the beginning?" I asked
Paige as she sat down. Both Paige and Jake
started their stories by going back to high
school.
In late March, Paige missed our first
interview due to her "nine-month sobriety
anniversary." But there was no celebration
because, as Paige noted, that would be simi-
lar to a graduation, and there's no graduation
from their program.
"We can't even have one drink and never
again will be able to have a drink," Paige
said. "As alcoholics, we don't know modera-
tion and never will. Iwill never want just one
drink,-and I keep having to remind myself
that."
The pace and character of Paige's story-
telling was a story in itself: She would slow
down and look at her hands as she spoke
about times when the drinking caused harm,
or in moments where there is black and she
doesn't remember. At other times - times
where she was proud of what she has over-
come or accepting of the events - she spoke
to me as though she was a teacher of sur-
vival.
Paige is an alcoholic in recovery. However,
her drinking tendencies didn't fit the ste-
reotypical definition of an "alcoholic" - she
never drank alone, she didn't start drinking
when she woke up and her schoolwork didn't
plummet. But, she did drink to a blackout
state almost every night.
She came to college not having experi-
enced alcohol - told to stay away from it in
high school as both an athlete and someone
with a family history of addictive tendencies.
And she did.
When Paige started at the University, she
was told by her mom to rush a sorority as a
means of making friends. During her time

in the sorority, she frequently encountered
alcohol and decided to start drinking.
"I'm slightly awkward and quiet," Paige
said. "So then I discovered alcohol and that
was the "magic elixir" we call it, as some-
thing that made me someone different,
which I didn't realize then."
Unlike Paige, Jake's addiction started
earlier in his life. When he started at the
University in winter 2012 he was already in
recovery. Jake first had issues with drugs
and alcohol when he was in high school.
"I started having issues with drugs around
16 years old," Jake said. "That escalated pret-
ty fast through my sophomore, junior (and)
senior years of high school, and I'd say after
my junior year things were pretty hectic.
Things with my parents were very rocky, and
I couldn't stop using."
But why Paige and Jake? Why were they
susceptible to becoming addicted to drugs.
and alcohol early in life? Paige figured genet-
ics had to do with it, Jake said circumstance.
I sought to learn the science behind addic-
tion from Psychology Prof. Terry Robinson,
wh teachesa course on the subject and con-
ducts research that explores addiction and
the effects drugs have on the brain.
According to Robinson, addiction is rooted
in a primitive brain system humans have
developed for survival called the dopamine-
reward system. It's responsible for impulses
like human attraction to items like bananas
and other food to help them survive.
Robinson said some of the leading
research on the causes of addiction involves
an over-activation, or hypersensitivity, of the
dopamine-reward system in the brain that
is due to repeated drug use. Dopamine is a
neurotransmitter, which is a small molecule
released from nerve cells in the brain into

spaces between nerve cell endings called
synapses, carrying signals to other nerve
cells.
"What we think is going on in addiction
is because these drugs produce a surge in
dopamine, and they produce an unusually
large surge compared to natural rewards,...
they render all of the stimuli associated with
drugs with pathological motivational value
so that then they become excessively want-
ed," Robinson said. "... They have this prop-
erty to tap into this dopamine system that's
there just to mediate natural rewards."
In other words, when someone uses a
drug, its properties cause the brain to release
more dopamine than it normally does and
the user feels compelled to use them again -
they end up wanting drugs more than they
want the things that help them survive.
However, there is a popular misconception
about dopamine - that it encourages "lik-
ing." Robinson says this idea is false.
"The role of dopamine in reward is to
mediate the wanting, the desire for it. And in
the brain the wanting and liking are separa-
ble," Robinson said. "And, in fact, people will
report the drugs aren't so great anymore in
terms of the pleasure they get, but they still
want it more and more and more."
With repeated drug use, the brain changes
in ways that are proposed to be similar
to learning. As the brain changes and the
dopamine system becomes "sensitized," the
effects of the drugs increase.
"You can sort of think of (sensitization)
as the inverse of tolerance," Robinson said.
"Usually when you think about being repeat-
edly exposed to drugs you get less and less '
drug effect, that's tolerance. And that's true,
tolerance develops to some drug effects, but
other drug effects show sensitization - that
is they get bigger and bigger, suggesting that
the neural systems that mediate these drug
