University enrollment is at an
all-time high despite a smaller
incoming freshman class than
last year,
accord- Michigan Daily
log to data EXCLUSIVE
released by
the Univer-
sity's Office of the Registrar this
morning.
For the third-straight year,
the University's student popu-
lation has grown to its largest
size ever with 42,716 students
enrolled this semester, up from
41,924 students last fall. The
growth can be attributed to a
2.8-percent increase in gradu-
ate students and a 1.4-percent
increase in undergraduates.
At 6,251 students, this year's
freshman class is about 3.8-per-
cent smaller than last year's
class of 6,496 students. The Uni-

versity also received its largest
number of freshman applicants
ever - a 25-percent increase
from the 2009-2010 application
cycle, which is attributed to the
University's switch to the Com-
mon Application last year.
Last year, the Universityen-

Postponement
* due to fire safety
regulations
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily StaffReporter
The University of Michigan
Health System's newly con-
structed C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital and Von Voigtlander
Women's Hospital will open

its doors to patients later than
anticipated.
Though the hospital will be
open for special events start-
ing Nov. 1, the beginning of
patient care - originally slated
for mid-November - has been
rescheduled to Dec. 4. Pat War-
ner, executive director of the
new hospital, explained that
the delay stems from fire safety
regulations and complications
with obtaining the building's
occupancy license, which forced

administrators to revise the
training. schedule for hospital
employees.
"We have 6,000 staff to ori-
ent, train and get familiar with
the building," Warner said. "We
thought that we'd be able to get
multiple faculty and staff in for
that training earlier, starting
this summer."
She added that the state's fire
marshal declared that no more
than 50 people - not including
construction workers - could

be inside of the building at the
same time prior to the hospital's
opening. The fire marshal made
the decision based on the build-
ing's size and lack of adequate
fire alarms. Additionally, the
fire marshal recommended that
any group in the building should
stay on the same floor in the
same unit to maximize safety.
While the complex was
scheduled to open Nov. 13, War-
ner said the new facility will

By RAYZA GOLDSMITH

In response to concerns from
students and faculty members
about the lack of privacy settings
on the University's new online
directory, MCommunity, the

University's Information Tech-
nology Services made a portion
of the website more secure.
On Saturday, ITS eliminated
the "Groups" tab, which previ-
ously allowed MCommunity
users to view other users' group
memberships. With the change,
users can still see their own
groups when logged in, but they
can only view basic informa-
tion on others users' profiles.
ITS also, removed the feature

Holly Nielsen, ITS interim
executive director of applica-
tion and information services,

launched on July 17 - after

Number of community college transfer

By CHELSEA LANDRY
Daily StaffReporter
Though community college
enrollment across the state
is fluctuating, the number of

community college transfer
students enrolling at the Uni-
versity is at an all-time high.
Dilip Das, the University's
assistant vice provost for aca-
demic affairs, said the number
of community college transfer
students at the University is the
highest in the past six years, up
by 60 students from last year.
However, at community colleg-

slight decreases.

Of the 1,016 community col-

University of Michigan this
year, approximately 120-150

How would you describe
your involvement with the
Martin Luther King Jr. memo-
rial in Washington D.C.?
The King family made it clear
that they were in favor of what
they called a "living memorial."
So I was one of five individuals
who chose to draft an internation-
al competition. Fifty-two coun-
tries sent entries, with 900 entries
altogether, and our group deter-
mined which design we thought
was best. It took 12 years to
receive all the proper governmen-
tal approval, and we got approval
to break ground 18 months ago,
and the rest is history.
What inspired you to become
involved in the field of architec-
ture?

My father and my uncle were
both carpenters of sorts, and
when I was of a formative age
of 8 or 9 years old, my parents
added what became known as a
playroom onto the house. At that
time in the late 40s, the idea of a
child having their own room was
unheard of. It reinforced in my
mind that space and architecture
could really have an impact on
how we find a bit of independence
and space to develop on our own
terms.
What do you currently teach
at the University?
I'm teaching an urban design
and redevelopment course, and
it's an interest of mine to teach a
technical course for kids who are
not architects.

What do you like most about
being a professor at the Univer-
sity?
Michigan has a very unique
mix of students. There's no ques-
tion the reason I've been teaching
for almost 40 years and still enjoy
it now is because of the mix of tal-
ent and work ethic from the stu-
dent body at U of M.
What do you like to do in your
spare time?
I find myself visiting various
old bookstores around Ann Arbor.
I like browsing and getting the
sense that there have been a lot
of smart people here before and
after me and open myself up to theC

British police clear illegal
Traveler camp in England

Thailand PM
says flood has put
country in crisis *

Essex Police
arrested 23 people
and tasered two
CRAYS HILL, England (AP)
- British police used sledgeham-
mers, crowbars and a cherry
picker yesterday to clear the way
for the eviction of Irish Travelers
from a site where they have lived
illegally for a decade.
By the afternoon police said
they were in control of the site,
and that bailiffs were beginning to
move onto the disputed property.
Essex Police said two protest-
ers were Tasered and 23 people
arrested after police officers were
attacked with rocks, other mis-
siles and liquids including urine.
Residents andsupporters, how-
ever, said police had used exces-
sive force.
Evictions of Travelers, a tra-
ditionally nomadic group similar
to, but ethnically distinct from,
Gypsy or Roma people, are rela-

tively common across Britain. But
few are as large, or as high-profile,
as yesterday's at Dale Farm.
The police and bailiffs faced
resistance from several dozen
protesters who threw bricks and
struggled with officers at the site,
set in fields 30 miles (50 kilome-
ters) east of London. One mobile
home was set on fire as police
moved in at dawn, and several
protesters chained themselves to
barricades with bicycle locks to
slow down the evictions. Others
scaled a 40-foot (12-meter) scaf-
folding tower.
Police moved protesters away
and later used a cherry picker, or
mechanized lifting platform, to
reach the scaffolding platform
and remove protesters who had
chained themselves to the struc-
ture.
The conflict over Dale Farm
has simmered since 2001, when
Travelers bought and settled on a
former scrap yard next to a legal
Travelers' site. The legal battle
dragged on for years until the

Travelers lost a final appeal last
week.
The local authority says it's a
simple planning issue - the 86
families lack permission to pitch
homes on the land. The Travelers
call it ethnic cleansing- the latest
chapter in a centuries-old story
of mistrust between nomads and
British society.
"I've been through a lot of evic-
tions, but I've never seen any-
thing like this ... they have come
in and started a riot that we never
wanted," said resident Kathleen
McCarthy, who accused police
of roughing up Travelers at the
site, injuring three women. "We
are being dragged out of the only
homes we have in this world."
Lily Hayes, who identified her-
self as a human rights observer,
also accused the police of using
unnecessary force.
The ambulance service said
one woman was taken to a hos-
pital with minor back injuries.
Five other people were treated for
smoke inhalation, breathing diffi-

culties and a nosebleed.
Authorities said the violence
was coming not from residents
but from their supporters - anar-
chists, environmentalists and
anti-capitalists who came to the
site from across Europe.
"The premeditated and orga-
nized scenes of violence that we
have already seen with protest-
ers throwing rocks and bricks,
threatening police with iron bars
and setting fire to a caravan are
shocking," said Tony Ball, leader
of Basildon Council, the local
authority.
He said while "no one takes any
satisfaction" in the police opera-
tion, he was confident that "after
10 years of negotiations to try and
find a peaceful solution to this,
that what we are doing is the right
thing."
His council has estimated that
the total costto taxpayers of evict-
ing the Travelers from the site
- including clean-up and post-
eviction security - could rise to 18
million pounds ($28 million).

Wayne State

A researcher at Wayne State
University in Detroit is accused of
putting dogs through severe pain
and distress during cardiovascu-
lar experiments.
A Washington-based group
called the Physicians Commit-
tee for Responsible Medicine
asked federal regulators yester-
day to investigate the lab of Donal
O'Leary.
In an 11-page petition, the
group says dogs have suffered
through multiple surgeries and
repeated turns on the treadmill.
The group based much of its com-
plaint on public documents.
O'Leary referred requests
for comment to a Wayne State
spokesman, who says the petition
is being reviewed.
The petition highlights the

Scientists: Climate
won't cause severe
Great Lakes loss
Climate change probably won't
reduce Great Lakes water levels
as much as experts have predict-
ed and might even cause them
to rise slightly, federal scientists
said yesterday.
For two decades, studies have
said a warming climate could
send water levels sharply lower by
boosting evaporation and reduc-
ing rain and snowfall in the Lake
Superior basin, which feeds the
other lakes. But a revised com-
puter modeling system suggests
those predictions were overstat-
ed, said Brent Lofgren, a scientist
at the NOAA Great Lakes Envi-
ronmental Research Laboratory
in Ann Arbor.
"While there are still many
unknowns about how climate
change will unfold in the Great
Lakes region, our results indi-
cate less loss of water than earlier
studies," Lofgren said.

Twenty-five deaths in 12 states
are now linked to listensa in can-

U.S. in more than 25 years.
The Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention said Tuesday
that 123 people have been sick-
ened, including those who died.
The tainted Colorado canta-
loupes should be off store shelves

es may continue to grow, as the

to two months to appear.
The CDC on Tuesday con-

firmed a sixth death in Colorado

Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming
have also reported deaths.

Cain plans to raise
taxes on 84 percent
of households
Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan
would raise taxes on 84 percent
of U.S. households, according to
an independent analysis released
Tuesday, contradicting claims
by the Republican presidential
candidate that most Americans
would see a tax cut.
The Tax Policy Center, a Wash-
ington think tank, says low- and
middle-income families would be
hithardest, withhouseholds mak-
ing between $10,000 and $20,000
seeing their taxes increase by
nearly 950 percent.
"You're talking a $2,700 tax
increase for people with incomes
between $10,000 and $20,000,"
said Roberton Williams, a senior
fellow at the Tax Policy Center.
"That's huge."

Global Fund ends$28
HIV AIDS grant in Mali

Government aid
cut after alleged
misuse of funding
BAMAKO, Mali (AP) - The
Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria said
yesterday it will stop a $28 mil-
lion HIV/AIDS grant to Mali's
government after investigators
found evidence money is being
misused.
The Global Fund said in a
statement that it will suspend
funding all but essential servic-
es under the grant until a new
structure can be found to man-
age the money.
Dr. Youssouf Diallo from
Mali's High Council for the
Fight Against AIDS called
the decision premature and
said the Council had not been
shown any of the evidence
against it.
"This decision is not the right
way to work together as part-
ners." Diallo said.
Mali, a poor, landlocked West

African nation relies on interna-
tional donors to fund its health
system.
The High Council for the
Fight Against AIDS is attached
directly to the Malian presi-
dent's office and the move
against the body is not the first
preventative measure the Glob-
al Fund has taken in Mali.
Earlier this, year the Fund
suspended another HIV/AIDS
grant to Mali worth $13.91 mil-
lion. That decision followed the
announcement in December
2010 of the suspension of fund-
ing of two malaria grants and
the termination of a third grant
for tuberculosis.
The Global Fund's inves-
tigative office has also found
evidence of fraud in a number
of other countries around the
world.
In December 2010, the Global
Fund announced that Mali and
four other countries - Ivory
Coast, Djibouti, Mauritania and
Papua New Guinea - would be
subject to special measures and
closer scrutiny of their grant

activities.
Last month, a high-powered
panel assembled to address the
problem said the Fund itself
would have to take some of
the responsibility for losses
in countries where it stopped
funding because of fraud. The
panel concluded that the con-
trols put in place by the Fund
to be sure the money is properly
disseminated "have not worked
as well as intended."
The Board of the Global Fund

Leader: Gadhafi
has 12,000 people
to 'enter Libya and
start the fight'
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) - Libya's
acting prime minister said yester-
day that ousted leader Moammar
Gadhafi is believed to be recruit-
ing fighters from other African
countries and preparing for a pos-
sible insurgency, hoping to desta-
bilize Libya's new regime.
The comments by Mahmoud
Jibril reflected fears that Gadhafi
will be able to use friendly rela-
tions with neighboring countries
cultivated during his more than
four decades in power to help him
launch a bid to return to power.
"Reports have shown that 68
vehicles with at least eightfighters
each crossed the Libyan borders
to Mali and Gadhafi is hiding in
the southern desert," Jibril told
reporters.
He said Gadhafi had made
a deal with the Hamada tribe,
which roams the borders between
Chad, Sudan and Libya, to provide
12,000 fighters "to enter Libya and
start the fight."
Suggesting that the U.S. also
was concerned about the possi-
bility, Secretary of State Hillary
Rodham Clinton said during a
visit to Tripoli Tuesday that she
hoped Gadhafi would be captured
or killed.
Gadhafi loyalists already have
put up fierce resistance in sev-
eral areas, preventing Libya's
new leaders from declaring full
victory nearly two months after
revolutionary forces seized Trip-
oli and have seized many other
parts of the oil-rich North Afri-
can nation.
Revolutionary fighters gained
control of one stronghold, Bani
Walid, this week. In the other
loyalist bastion of Sirte, anti-
Gadhafi commanders said they
have squeezed Gadhafi's forces
into a residential area of about
700 square meters but were still

coming under heavy fire from
surrounding buildings. Deputy
defense minister Fawzi Abu Katif
told The Associated Press that
authorities still believe Gadhafi's
son Muatassim is among the ex-
regime figures holed up in the
diminishing area.
It took the anti-Gadhafi fight-
ers, who also faced disorganiza-
tion in their own ranks, two days
to capture a single residential
building.
It is unclear whether Gadhafi
loyalists who have escaped might
continue the fight and attempt to
organize an insurgency using the
vast amount of weapons Gadhafi
was believed to have stored in
hideouts in the remote southern
desert.
Unlike Iraq's Saddam Hussein,
Gadhafi had no well-organized
political party that could form the
basis of an insurgent leadership.
However, regional and ethnic dif-
ferences have already appeared
among the ranks of the revolution-
aries, possibly laying the founda-
tion for civil strife.
Gadhafi has issued several
audio recordings trying to rally
supporters. Jibril and other Liby-
an officials have said they believe
he's hiding somewhere in the vast
southwestern desert near the bor-
ders with Niger and Algeria.
Jibril also addressed concerns
about a rise in revenge attacks and
lawlessness as thousands of young
men with weapons have found
themselves unemployed after
waging months of brutal fighting.
He said authorities were con-
sidering plans to give them the
option of joining private security
companies that will be given pri-
ority for securing the borders, oil
fields and public institutions, or
the national army.
He also reiterated that he
plans to resign after liberation is
declared and turn over the reins of
the country to a new interim gov-
ernment that can guide the nation
to elections. The transitional lead-
ership has said a vote would be
held within eight months of lib-
eration.


White House to
talk nuclear arms
with North Korea

U.S. making
demands with ally
South Korea
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Raising hopes for a new era of
rapprochement with nuclear-
armed North Korea, the Obama
administration said yesterday it
would sit down with the reclu-
sive regime for a fresh round
of atomic weapons talks and
appoint a full-time envoy with
the task of persuading Pyong-
yang to abandon its nuclear pro-
gram.
Disarmament efforts are
saddled with a history of deceit
and mistrust, but the meet-
ings on Monday and Tuesday in
Geneva represent another step
forward after lastyear's military
attacks on South Korea that led
to threats of war. They are the
second setofnuclear discussions
between the United States and
North Korea since July, after a
three-year freeze in diplomacy.
"We're looking for more
progress," State Department
spokesman Mark Toner said in
Washington. "We're not seeking
to reward North Korea in any
way by holding these talks. And
we certainly don't want to have
talks just for the sake of talking.
We want to see a seriousness of
purpose and a commitment to
moving this process forward
to taking the steps that they've
already committed to take."
As Washington intensifies its
engagement of Pyongyang, it is
turning to seasoned diplomat
Glyn Davies to lead the efforts.
Davies, the U.S. ambassador to
the International Atomic Ener-
y Agency, will replace Stephen

Bosworth, though both will be
meeting next week with the
North Korean delegation led by
Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye
Gwan.
The U.S. and its ally South
Korea are pressing familiar
demands. Toner said the U.S.
wants North Korea to adhere
to a 2005 agreement it later
reneged on, which required the
North's verifiable denucleariza-
tion in exchange better relations
with its Asian neighbors, energy
assistance and a pledge from
Washington that it wouldn't
attack the isolated country. The
U.S. and North Korea are still
formally at war, having only
signed an armistice ending their
1950-1953 conflict.
To demonstrate its serious-
ness, American officials want
Pyongyang to take concrete
steps such as freezing its ura-
nium and plutonium programs
and allowing IAEA inspectors
back into the country. They are
also looking for the North to
show that it won't launch any
new military actions against
South Korea, or further nuclear
or missile tests.
In its latest nuclear-related
infraction, North Korea unveiled
a uranium enrichment program
in 2010 in defiance of U.N. Secu-
rity Council resolutions. Ten-
sions also spiked last year after
South Korea was attacked twice
militarily, including the sinking
of a submarine that was blamed
on the North and killed 46 sail-
ors.
In a separate engagement
effort, the U.S. also has reopened
talks with North Korea on coop-
erative searches for the remains
of U.S. troops killed in the Kore-
an War.

FROM Il-E DAIL
Support the struggling
Welfare program funding should be continued
ith a stagnant economy and a job market still in turmoil,
Michigan is searching for ways to cut its budget. But the
government is attempting to salvage the state economy
at the expense of Michigan's low-income citizens. In November, the
state will take away cash assistance from likely 41,000 people and
this past July, the state passed a law limiting residents to 48 months
of welfare eligibility. The state government needs to make cuts in a
way that spreads the burden among all residents and does not target
one group specifically.

Recent cuts to social welfare programs
have raised the question of whether the
money saved is worth the potential harm that
could come to Michigan residents.
The cuts resulted in large reductions
in funding for food banks and soup kitch-
ens. Food banks and soup kitchens provide
an invaluable service to communities and
residents. Many of these organizations are
already facing massively reduced resources,
often preventing them from meeting the
needs of their area. Organizations that feed
the hungry are important resources for
Michigan's moststrugglingresidents, and it's
crucial that they are properly funded.
Another $62 million was also cut from the
funding of agencies like the Salvation Army
and the Heat and Warmth Fund. The major-
ity of that money was supposed to be used
to fund heating and other utilities for low-
income residents during the winter months.
Michigan has one of the highest state
unemploymentrates inthe country with more
than 11 percent of its citizens out of work.
Though this number has decreased in recent
years, there are many residents throughout
the state who are struggling to make ends
meet, and cuts to welfare programs penal-
ize the state's most disenfranchised citizens.
The decision to reduce funding to programs

designed to aid low-income families and
unemployed Michigan residents could not be
coming at a worse time.
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's economic
plan touts tax cuts for businesses that could
ultimately create jobs and help rebuild the
economy. But in order to balance the loss
in revenue from reduced corporate income
taxes, welfare programs that help feed Mich-
igan families and allow them to stay in their
homes are losing funding. While the state
needs to cut spending somewhere, taking
away funds from the less fortunate is not the
wayto do it.
The best way for the thousands of strug-
gling Michigan residents to get back on their
feet is through aid and education. It's clear
the government cannot continue to operate
with such a large budget, and cuts will have
to be made. But rather than making massive
cuts from programs that help Michigan's
struggling residents, the government should
make smaller cuts across the board.
The prosperity of Michigan's low-income
residents will ultimately contribute to the
economic health of the state as a whole. Rath-
er than being downsized, programs that give
aid and support to residents who are strug-
gling need to be properly funded, so they can
continue to give help to those who need it.

SARAH SQUIRE I
Mind your manners

Manners are pounded into us from the
moment we can speak - when it suddenly
becomes rude for a 1 year old to point.
In theory, being polite is great. Nothing is
gained from being outright rude to strangers,
or even friends, and it can be surprising how
much an unexpected smile can do for your
day. But some people cross the line by being
overly polite to the point where they waste
hours every week performing meaningless
and often unnoticed formalities. Even worse
is the unending stream of people I am forced
to have passing interactions with who believe
they are polite because they hold the door for
me, but who then continue to walk next to
their three friends, blocking the entire side-
walk.
If you want to continue with your ineffi-
cient, repetitive life - holding the door open
for me when my hands are free and I'm still
20 feet away, sending me e-mails with only
two words, "thank you," when I'm sitting 5
feet away or, worst of all, saying you're wel-
come to every reflex "thanks" - go ahead.
But I will not allow your bad habits to affect
my life any longer.
When you move aside, setting your feet
to offset the weight of the first door into the
Chemistry Building while I make my grand
entrance, do not expect me to break my stride
for the second door. I'll give it a little extra
swing for you to catch, but that's it. If you
want to sit in your car and wave me on at the
crosswalk when I have made the clear effort
to stop all my momentum, then fine. Never
mind that it takes 10 more seconds for me to
cross the street than it will take your car and
that I am the one in 50 people who will stop
for you. Go ahead and sit with that I'm-such-
a-considerate-person smile on your face.
I'm not a mean person or a social outcast.
I understand how society works. My problem
with many niceties is they end up clogging
our already hectic lives without any benefit.
Further, many proponents of these formali-
ties ignore common street sense. These are
lose-lose situations. Whether you agree or
not, allow me to propose a few new rules for
us 1 to follow, either in replacement of or in

addition to the classics, while we attempt to
cohabitate in this city.
1. Get off the bus (or elevator). Are you on
a crowded bus from North Campus, on your
way to receiving another tardy? Another
stop, another minute late. Or maybe not. If,
instead of leaning over the poor soul seated
in the aisle seat while the freshmen pile off at
the Hill,you stepped offthe bus and out ofthe
way (and somehow convince the five other
people blocking the door to do the same), you
all might finally reach C.C. Little in a normal
amount of time. Keep in mind that getting
off the bus and out of the way means moving
clear from the door. While we're on buses,
try putting your backpack between your feet,
and you'll witness that 15 more people can
pile in for the adventure ride.
2. Don't sit in the aisle seat in lecture with-
out a good reason. Good reasons include no
other available seats, crutches, a lefty desk,
leaving early or you are 10 minutes late and
want to sit down as soon as possible. This is
especially important in a crowded classroom
where you know someone will eventually be
forced to climb over you.
3. Stay to the right on the sidewalk. See
the bike speeding toward you? He can move
more adroitly than you. Stick to the right, and
he'll swerve around. Are you approaching
an intersection in the Diag? Maintain your
speed, and she can easily maneuver around
you. Slow down or dodge back and forth, and
you are asking for a collision. Don't see any-
thing? Chances are someone is behind you,
on foot or on wheels, too pissed off to ask you
to move without hissing.
I have more proposals for situations in
everyday life such as crossing the street and
getting on and off an airplane. And there
might be other ways, better ways, to improve
our collective lives. But for now, I challenge
you to explain why the methods I recom-
mend wouldn't. If only Aretha Franklin had
sung about these rules, I'd get a little more
R-E-S-P-E-C-T and make it to class on time.

The Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. military
personnel used an unmanned drone to kill U.S.-born
Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaeda leader living in Yemen,
on Sept. 30. Al-Awlaki was a U.S. citizen. He was also
indisputably an enemy of the United States - credible
sources suggest he played a role in training several of
the 9/11 hijackers, spoke to and encouraged alleged
Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan and helped plan the
unsuccessful attack on a Detroit-bound flight last
December. In January 2010, his name was added to a
public list of persons targeted for assassination.
Drone strikes in Yemen are nothing new. American
military and intelligence personnel routinely use air-
borne drones to carry out targeted assassinations on
Yemeni soil. But until al-Awlaki's name appeared on the
list, the CIA had never officially targeted a U.S. citizen
for assassination. This is because U.S. citizens accused of
crimes have the right to be tried by a jury and face their
accusers.A targeted assassination, even one approved by
numerous analysts, lawyers and high-ranking members
of the executive branch, is not the legal process through
which criminals are normally sentenced.
I am troubled by the CIA's decision to execute an
American citizen - now that it has been done once, it
may be easier to justify similar actions in the future.
At the same time, I believe that the assassination of
al-Awlaki was justifiable. It was justifiable because his
actions were equivalent to those of a soldier in war-
time. He was in a battlefield, and the methods used to
kill him were acceptable under wartime conditions.
Before the government carries out an assassination, it
should show that the target is a soldier on a battlefield,
and the methods to be used comply with international_
codes of military conduct.
Roger Simon of the Chicago Sun-Times attempted to
justify the killing and suggested that al-Awlaki should
be thought of as a combatant on a battlefield because
any location in the world can be considered a battle-
field for the purposes of the war on terror. Such logic

could justify targeted killings anywhere there are sus-
pected al-Qaeda operatives - even Canada or within
the U.S.
Although it is dangerous to argue that the entire
world is a battlefield, it is not dangerous to sayYemen is
a battlefield in the war on terror because the president
of Yemen has authorized U.S. strikes against militants
in his country. The fact that U.S. forces may use lethal
force in Yemen is not a secret and has not been for
some time. When al-Awlaki went to Yemen, he entered
a place where it was known that the U.S. had permis-
sion to kill al-Qaeda operatives. He became an enemy
soldier on an active battlefield. Conceived this way, the
drone strike that killed him was no different from a
military strike against the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Still, al-Awlaki did not lose his U.S. citizenship when
he began fighting for al-Qaeda, which means he didn't
lose the right to confront his accusers in court. And in
a way, he tried. After the announcement that al-Awlaki
was on the targeted list, his father sued the CIA and
asked for al-Awlaki to be removed from the list. The
judge ruled that only Anwar al-Awlaki had standing
to bring such a suit. He held that a person who wishes
to challenge his or her inclusion on the list must do so
in person. This is entirely fair. Because U.S. courts do
not try accused criminals who are absent, it would be
unfair for a U.S. court to grant relief to a person who
refuses to appear before the court, especially when
that person has deliberately placed himself outside
of U.S. jurisdiction. Instead of challenging his inclu-
sion on the list, al-Awlaki hid in a place where trying
to arrest him would have put additional lives at risk.
In this case, the CIA acted with appropriate military
force against a legitimate military target on a known
battlefield. It is important that the assassination of al-
Awlaki be justified in this way and that this legitimate
act sets an appropriate precedent.

Ohio man sets
wild animals
loose from park


48 animals killed,
6 captured in
overnight hunt
ZANESVILLE, Ohio (AP) -
Sheriff's deputies shot nearly 50
wild animals - including 18 rare
Bengal tigers and 17 lions - in a
big-game hunt across the Ohio
countryside yesterday after the
owner of an exotic-animal park
threw their cages open and com-
mitted suicide in what appeared
to be one last act of spite against
his neighbors and police.
As homeowners nervously hid
indoors, officers equipped with
high-powered rifles and shoot-
to-kill orders spread out through
fields and woods to hunt down
about 56 animals that had been
set loose from the Muskingum
County Animal Farm by its
owner, Terry Thompson, before
he shot himself to death Tues-
day.
After an all-night hunt that
t extended into Wednesday after-
noon, 48 animals had been killed
and six captured alive and taken
to the Columbus Zoo, authorities
said. The only animals believed
still on the loose were a wolf and
a monkey.
Those destroyed included
six black bears, two grizzlies,
a baboon and three mountain
lions.
Jack Hanna, TV personal-
ity and former director of the
Columbus Zoo, defended the
sheriff's decision to kill the ani-
mals, but said the deaths of the
Bengal tigers were especially
tragic. There are only about
1,400 of the endangered cats left
in the world, he said.
"When I heard 18 I was still
in disbelief," Hanna said. "The
most magnificent creature in the
entire world, the tiger is."

As the hunt dragged on out-
side of Zanesville, population
25,000, schools closed in the
mostly rural area of farms and
widely spaced homes 55 miles
east of Columbus. Parents were
warned to keep children and
pets indoors. And flashing signs
along highways told motorists,
"Caution exotic animals" and
"Stay in vehicle."
Officers were ordered to kill
the animals instead of trying to
bring them down with tranquil-
izers for fear that those hit with
darts would escape in the dark-
ness and soon regain conscious-
"These animals were on
the move, they were showing
aggressive behavior," Sheriff
Matt Lutz said. "Once the night-
fall hit, our biggest concern was
having these animals roaming."
Lutz said at an afternoon
news conference that the dan-
ger had passed and that people
could move around freely again,
but that the monkey would
probably be shot because it was
believed to be carrying a herpes
disease.
The sheriff would not specu-
late why Thompson killed him-
self and why he left open the
cages and fences at his 73-acre
preserve, dooming the animals
he seemed to love so much.
But Thompson, 62, had had
repeated run-ins with the law
and his neighbors. Lutz said
that the sheriff's office had
received numerous complaints
since 2004 about animals escap-
ing onto neighbors' property,
and that Thompson had been
charged with animal-related
offenses.
John Ellenberger, a neighbor,
speculated that Thompson freed
the animals to get back at neigh-
bors and police. "Nobody much
cared for him," Ellenberger said.

Karzai has cited the killing
as a reason why peace efforts
are futile. He lamented recently
that although he wants to con=
tinue, neighboring Pakistan
should be in the lead since the
Taliban high command lives
there. In addition, spectacular
attacks - like one last month on
the U.S. Embassy compound and
the headquarters of the US-led
NATO forces in Kabul - by the
Haqqani network have dented
enthusiasm for the push.
The U.S. official said the
Obama administration is sympa-
thetic to Karzai's desire for Paki-
stan to do more and that Clinton
would talk with Karzai about the
need for Pakistan to put addi-
tional pressure on the Haqqani
network.
Over the weekend, militants
tried but failed to blast their way
into an American base in east-.
ern Afghanistan, striking before
dawn with rocket-propelled gre-
nades and a car bomb. The Tali-
ban claimed responsibility for
the attack in a text message sent

to The Associated Press.
NATO says such spectacular
strikes, many of them perpe-
trated by the Haqqani network,
are actually down from past
years. But assassinations have
increased 60 percent for the
same period with 131 people
killed so far this year.Y
In addition to reconcilia-
tion, Clinton will also be press-
ing the Afghans on reaching a
binding security agreement that
will govern U.S.-Afghanistan
relations after American troops
leave. The U.S. plans to bring
most forces home by 2015 and
intends withdraw the 33,000
additional troops that President
Barack Obama sent to Afghani-
stan in late 2009 by the end of the
fighting season in 2012, 10,000 of
them by the end of this year.
The U.S. hopes to have the
security agreement ready before
an international conference on
Afghanistan's future in early
December. That will be meant as
a signal to Afghanistan and the

Congress forms deal
to fix No Child Left

* Behind, then stalls talk Indigenous march reaches Bolivia's capital

Obama frustrated
by delay to overhaul
parts of law
WASHINGTON (AP) - A rare
show of bipartisanship in a divid-
ed Congress produced a deal to
fix an education law long consid-
ered flawed, until a single senator
stalled progress yesterday.
The delay would be short and
would not deter the commit-
tee working on one of the most
significant overhauls of the No
Child Left Behind law since it
was passed in 2002, the chair-
man said.
A little more than an hour into
the hearing by the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee, Sen. Rand Paul,
R-Ky., used a procedural maneu-
ver to put the brakes on the dis-
cussion.
The renewed focus in Wash-
ington on education comes as the
2012 campaign begins to unfold.
President Barack Obama has
chided Congress for not acting to
revise the law and has told states
they can seek waivers from some
unpopular requirements. He also
has made saving teachers' jobs
an essential part of his $447 bil-
lion jobs plan.
The Senate committee chair-
man, Iowa Democrat Tom
Harkin, and the top Republi-
can, Wyoming's Mike Enzi,
announced a bipartisan bill on
Monday that seeks to give more
control over education to states
and local districts.
At the hearing, Harkin and
Enzi said they were unhappy
with parts of the measure, but
pleased they could achieve a con-
sensus on the issue.
Paul complained that he
wasn't given enough time to
review the more than 800-page
bill and said there haven't been
hearings on the bill this year.
He saidthefederalgovernment
would retain too much control

over education and that students
still would be tested every year.
Paul used a procedural
maneuver to put a halt on the
hearing, citing a rule that says
a committee cannot meet when
the Senate is in session. That rule
typically is waived.
"I think it's a mistake to con-
tinue No Child Left Behind in
any form or fashion," Paul told
the committee.
Harkin said the commit-
tee had hearings last year on
the issue, and that Paul's move
would not deter the committee's
work. The committee is sched-
uled to resume debating the bill
Thursday morning. Harkin said
that the committee will debate
the more than 70 amendments
Paul has indicated he will file.
A coalition of 20 civil rights,
disability rights and business
groups, including the NAACP
and the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, expressed criticism of the
overhaul.
They said "states would not
have to set any measurable
achievement and progress targets
or even graduation rate goals"
and huge numbers of low-achiev-
ing kids would slip through the
cracks.
Earlier, the administration
said it wasn't pleased that the bill
left out a requirement on teacher
and principal evaluations.
Obama said last month that
he was so frustrated that Con-
gress hadn't fixed No Child Left
Behind that he was allowing
states that met certain condi-
tions to get around some parts
of the law. At least 39 states,
in addition to the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico, have
told the Education Department
they intend to seek a waiver.
A GOP-led House committee
has forwarded three bills that
would revise the law. But some of
the more contentious issues, such
as teacher accountability and
effectiveness, have not yet been
addressed.

Indians protest
against highway
through Amazon
LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) - More
than 1,000 Indians opposing a
jungle highway that they say
will spoil their lands in Boliv-
ia's Amazon drew cheers today
when they paraded into the
world's highest capital after a
63-day protest march.
Their trek, including a failed
attempt by baton-swinging
police to break up the march
two weeks ago, has won wide-
spread sympathy and fueled
charges that leftist President
Evo Morales discriminates
against Bolivia's Amazon-based

indigenous groups in favor of the
highland Indians who dominate
his government and the National
Assembly.
"He doesn't care about his
brothers from the lowlands,"
said Fernando Najera, a 35-year-
old Siriono Indian with tattered
sandals who met the protesters
who walked to La Paz from the
Isiboro-Secure nature preserve
that would be crossed by the
proposed highway.
Najera's sentiments are
shared by many lowlands Indi-
ans who believe this, poor
Andean nation's first indigenous
president considers them sec-
ond-class citizens and favors his
own people, the Aymara, and the
other highland group, the Que-
chua.

But after the march ended at
a plaza in central La Paz, march
leader Fernando Vargas and,
Indian legislator Pedro Nuni
said the intent was not to topple
Morales but to find a solution to
their complaints. Communica-
tions Minister Ivan Canelas said
indigenous leaders were con-
sidering meeting with Morales
today.
F Morales has said the highway
is needed to help Bolivia's poorer
regions develop and has accused
the marchers of being dupes of
right-wing groups. Protesters
say the 190-mile (300-kilome-
ter) highway would despoil the
Isiboro-Secure preserve, a park
that is home to 15,000 indig-
enous people.
Frictions among indigenous

communities have been a prob-
lem in Bolivia. About 62 percent
of Bolivians identify them-
selves as indigenous, and the
majority of these are Aymara or
Quechua.
Quechuas and Aymaras have
long migrated from their home
grounds in the arid, wind-swept
highland plains in search of
opportunity in the eastern low-
lands where the earth is fertile
and life is easier.
"The president doesn't respect
the 'Plurinational State' that he
himself promoted, and he wants
to impose on lowlands Indi-
ans the culture and customs of
the Aymara and Quechua," said
Pedro Moye, leaders of CIDOB,
Bolivia's main lowlands indig-
enous federation.

Foreign tourists wait to board charter flights after checking out of their hotels in Kenya on Oct. 3, 201t. Nervous hotel owners are urging Kenya's government to step
up security in the area popular with tourists and rich Kenyans after last weekend's kidnapping of a French woman by Somali gunmen.

Four Europeans
were kidnapped
from the country in
the past six weeks
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -
France said yesterday that a
cancer-stricken quadriplegic
Frenchwoman kidnapped off a
Kenyan resort island appears to
have died in captivity in Soma-
lia, prompting Kenya to call the
death an act of terror against the
East African nation and France.
Kenya said it sent some 1,600
troops into Somalia last week-
end to hunt al-Shabab militants
because of the kidnapping of the
French woman and three other
Europeans from its country over
the last six weeks. The nation's
tourism minister told The Asso-
ciated Press that the invasion is

meant to push Islamist militants
away from Kenya's tourist desti-
nations.
Somali gunmen snatched
Marie Dedieu in the middle of
the night from her resort island
home near Lamu on Oct. 1. The
66-year-old, wheelchair-bound
woman suffered from cancer and
required special medications
several times a day, medicine her
captors did not take with them.
French officials said Dedieu's
state of health and the fact her
kidnappers "probably refused to
give her the medication we sent
her" likely led to the death. The
foreign ministry said her death
had not been absolutely con-
firmed but was the most likely
situation.
, "We are so, so sad. We have
lost a mother of this village. We
have not lost a foreigner. We have
lost a mother of the community,"
said Abdullah Fadhil, the prop-

erty manager at Dedieu's resi-
dence in Lamu. "We wish she
would be alive but because she
has been sick and I know that the
captors cannot give her the care
she requires ... she has been very
weak."
France's Foreign Ministry
said that unspecified "contacts"
told French officials that Dedieu
had died but the date and cir-
cumstances of her death were
not immediately known. It did
not elaborate.
The Kenyan government
offered its condolences and said
Dedieu died while in al-Shabab
captivity. Kenya maintains al-
Shabab is behind the recent kid-
nappings, though some analysts
have instead blamed pirates or
criminals.
"The kidnapping and deten-
tion of Marie Dedieu was a terror
act not only against her, but also
against Kenya, her home country

France and the entire world," the
Kenyan government statement
said.
After a weekly Cabinet meet-
ing with President Nicolas Sar-
kozy, Foreign Minister Alain
Juppe said Dedieu's death "isn't
totally confirmed but is more
than probable."
"Madame Dedieu was a
gravely ill 66-year-old woman,
afflicted with cancer (and) quad-
riplegic," he said. "Seizing a
woman in this state is an act of
barbarity."
. French officials have demand-
ed that her remains be handed
over, and residents in Lamu
remembered her as a kind
woman.
"She was my friend," said resi-
dent Beatrice Halua. "She knew
how to live with everyone: good
people, bad people. She was a
nice person. She had so many
friends."

World Bank president talks plan
for global economy, countries' debt

Robert Zoellick
speaks to students
for Citigroup
Foundation Lecture
By BRANDON SHAW
Daily StaffReporter
The European debt crisis may
be at the forefront of World Bank
Group President Robert Zoel-
lick's mind. But yesterday, he
made a stop far from the Eastern
side of the Atlantic.
As part of the 2011 Citigroup
Foundation Lecture Series, Zoel-
lick spoke to about 350 students
yesterday in the Ross School of
Business about World Bank's per-
spective on the global economy
and his own ideas on movements
taking place worldwide.
The World Bank provides
low-interest loans and grants to
developing countries to invest in
areas like education and infra-
structure.
Zoellick also spoke about his
plans for his speeches at the
European Union summit this
coming weekend and the G20
Summit next month. Zoellick
said that at the two summit
meetings, he will present his
three-pillared plan for balancing

the global economy.
The first component of his
plan is the recapitalization, or
the rearrangingof debt and equi-
ty mixture, of banks. European
banks are seemingly moving
toward raising private capital,
Zoellick said. However, he added
that their stability is not yet cer-
tain.
Referencing Greece's high
amount of debt, Zoellick said
his plan's second pillar is assist-
ing developing countries, which
is crucial to his bank's global
expansion. Zoellick said the
third pillar is determining
whether or not Greece's debt
will worsen.
There are a variety of pro-
grams that can be initiated in the
United States and worldwide to
help with the growing economic
crisis, Zoellick said. Among them
are a comprehensive reform of
tax programs and balanced bud-
gets.
In response to the economic
crisis and the public's disillusion-
ment with the financial industry,
Zoellick explained that World
Bank prides itself on adapting to
the ever-expanding environment
through - economic policy initia-
tives and philanthropic work.
"Just as the world has changed,
so has the World Bank Group," he
said.

There are 187 countries that
are shareholders of the World
Bank Group, with the U.S.'s share
comprising 15 percent, accord-
ing to Zoellick. While he said the
World Bank differs from its com-
petitors on Wall Street in its daily
transactions and business goals,
Zoellick noted that it is still a cli-
ent-driven business.
"One of the things I try and get
people to do is to focus on their
clients - something I strongly
believe in," he said.
When asked to defend the
recent criticism from The Econo-
mist, which claimed that Zoel-
lick supports the gold standard
-- a monetary system in which
the standard economic unit of
account is a fixed mass of gold
-- he said that he was "misunder-
stood."
"Let me be clear - I was not
at all asking or calling for a gold
standard, but stating that as peo-
ple moved to gold, it was adding
to their uncertainty about the
value of currencies," Zoellick
said.
"My own belief is that the U.S.
dollar will remain the predomi-
nant reserve currency," he added.
In response to a question about
the U.S. economy's credit rating,
Zoellick said he predicts that the
downgrading - in which Stan-
dard & Poor changed the U.S. rat-

ing from AAA to AA+ in August
- will "serve as a wake-up call."
He said it will show future gen-
erations there are critical steps
the U.S. needs to take to improve
the economy.
"I'm a bigbeliever in more free
trade," Zoellick said. "Open mar-
kets spark the economy."
In an interview after the event,
Zoellick spoke about the Occupy
Wall Street movements and the
negative effect they could have
on the global marketplace.
"I'm more worried about the
effects on developing countries,
which you can see in the markets,
in the bond yields," he said. "And
the thing that we're watching
quite closely is the confidence in
the business sectors or the con-
sumer, and these countries have
less cushion, or less room, for
that to drop."
Ben Pierson, a second-year
MBA student in the Ross School
of Business, said he appreciated
Zoellick's willingness to share
his opinions.
"I wanted to hear something
that doesn't have a media filter on
it, which I feel like these things
often have," Pierson said. "I feel
like he was honest on what his
opinions were, even if he pivoted
away from questions that may
have been perceived as contro-
versial."

early," Warner said. "This is a
massive project, and we're on
time with construction, and our
overall plan is still on track."
The hospital's opening has
also been delayed because the
buildingstill needs an occupancy
certification. According to War-
ner, the-building was supposed to
be examined for its certificate of
occupancy last week. Instead, it
will be surveyed this week.
As a result of these complica-
tions, hospital administrators
decided to rethink their original
opening date.
"There's nothing magical
about the date November 15,"
Warner said.
She added that the safety and
comfort of the staff was para-
mount for the administrators in
their decision to postpone the
hospital's opening date.
"We have always said that we
will make sure our faculty and
staff feel they've had enough
time to be trained and oriented,"
Warner said.
The new date, Dec. 4, was
selected because it will not only
account for all the schedule
changes resulting from building
complications, but it will also

dents' concerns on the issue and

"After hearing about the issue,
we acted pretty quickly," Nielson
said. "We had to assess the exact
nature of the problem and find an
appropriate solution."
ITS conferred with the Office
of the Provost and the Office of

change before it was finalized,

Warner added that the new
opening date also has some
benefits for hospital adminis-
trators and staff. She pointed
to the benefit of holding facnlty
and staff training closer to the
opening date because the mate-
rial would be fresh in employ-
ees' minds upon the facility's
opening. In addition, hospital
employees welcomed the dcl i

The 12-story complex, which
cost $754 million, is the larg-

undertaken by the University.
"The majority of faculty and

of this decision," Warner said.
"We don't make a decision like
this without the input of all of
our key faculty, staff and lead-
ers."
Warner said the hospital
administrators are excited
about the new facility, which
she described as state-of-the-art
and environmentally sustain-
able.

Nielson said she hasn't heard

many didn't know it existed.
Engineering sophomore Beth-

Though LSA freshman David
Carlson didn't know his groups

stands why the change was made.
"I don't see a problem with (the

TRANSFER
From Page 1A
part of the University's Office of
Academic Multicultural Initia-
tives, M-POD offers mentorship,
one-on-one counseling and extra
orientation sessions to help ease
students through the transfer
process.
"Our goal is to increase aware-
ness among community college
students about the option to
transfer to Michigan," Das said.
Das said he does not believe the
University's increased numbers
related to decreases in enroll-
ment at community colleges.
In comparison to the Univer-
sity, enrollment at Washtenaw
Community College decreased

this year compared to the 2010-
2011 academic year. Numbers
shot up at Oakland Commu-
nity College and enrollment at
Macomb Community College
remained stable.
Kathy Currie, director of stu-
dent records at Washtenaw Com-
munity College, said there was an
8.8-percent decrease in enroll-
ment from last year. Currie said
she believes cuts to federal pro-
grams such as No Worker Left
Behind are largely responsible
for the drop. She added that many
education benefit programs
offered by businesses to employ-
ees have been discontinued.
However, Currie said this
fall's decrease in enrollment puts
WCC back at average attendance
numbers. The school saw record
enrollment in 2009 and 2010, she

said.
Despite the change in enroll-
ment numbers, very little has
actually changed at Washtenaw
Community College.
"We haven't cut any services
as a result of this," Currie added.
While WCC has a smaller
student body this year, Macomb
Community College has had
"virtually no difference" in atten-
dance, said Howard Hughey,
spokesman for Macomb Commu-
nity College.
"We have not seen any abnor-
mal increases or decreases from
last year," Hughey said.
With an opposite enrollment
trend from WCC, the five cam-
puses of Oakland Community
College, saw an upward shift in
student attendance this year.
OCC Spokesman George Cart-

sonis, spokesman for Oakland
Community College, said fall
enrollment is at an all-time high
with 29,262 students.
"We are the largest (commu-
nity college) in the state, and the
25th largest in the nation," Cart-
sonis said.
Many students choose OCC
before transferring to a four-
year university because of the
college's affordable credit hours,
Cartsonis said. Many OCC stu-
dents transfer to the Univer-
sity of Michigan's Dearborn
campus after two years at OCC,
and approximately 30-40 former
OCC students enroll each year at
the Ann Arbor campus.
"With higher education costs
skyrocketing, community col-
leges are the student's best bet,"
Cartsonis said.

culture in Southeast Michigan.
People involved in the project
also hope the grant will create
opportunities for collaboration
between the farm start-ups, the
Ann Arbor Farmers Market and
the University.
Jennifer Fike, executive
director of the Food System Eco-
nomic Partnership, has arranged
sales between the farms at the
Tilian Center and the East Quad
dining hall since 2006. She said
the grant will offer young farm-
ers an opportunity to start their
own ventures, specifically those
whose parents did not bequeath
them land and agricultural
infrastructure.
"It's very difficult to make a
living at farming, and so we're
trying to help remove some of
the barriers that new farmers
are experiencing," Fike said.
"There are people who want to
go into farming, but it takes a lot
of money to be able to do that."
She added that the shortage
of young farmers compounds
the importance of the Tilian
Center's task. The Partnership's
2010 Future Farmer Research
Report found 76 percent of the
surveyed farmers in Jackson,
Lenawee and Monroe, Mich.
were age 50 and older.
ENROLLMENT
From Page 1A
year, however, the University was
"gratified" that it met its enroll-
ment targets, University Provost
Philip Hanlon said in an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily
last month.
The average high school grade
point average for this year's fresh-

Through the Tilian Center,
Southeast Michigan has the
land resources necessary to
shift that demographic, Fike
said.
"Now, through this grant,
there's access to capital," she
said.
There are currently three
farms on the Tilian Center
Land, two of which - Seeley
Farms and Green Things Farm
- sell their vegetables at the
Ann Arbor Farmers Market in
Kerrytown. Fike said she would
like to see the Ann Arbor Farm-
ers Market grow along with the
Tilian Center.
Regarding the federal grant's
impact on the University, Uni-
versity Housing spokesman
Peter Logan said the grant
does not necessarily present an
opening for increased business
between the University and
the farm start-ups. However,
the University has purchased
food from local and sustainable
sources for the past few years,
Logan said. He pointed to East
Quad chef Buzz Cummings who
requests locally grown foods
through the Partnership.
Fike said she hopes the Uni-
versity will increase its purchas-
ing of sustainable food from
these farm start-ups.
"Our experience in working
with the University is that they
are interested in local purchasing,

and I could see that there couldbe
room for growth in other areas of
the campus," she said.
Like Fike, Larissa Larsen,
an associate professor of urban
planning at the University, and
Molly Notarianni, manager of
the Ann Arbor Farmers Mar-
ket, said increased collabora-
tion with local farms would
be beneficial to all parties
involved and has the potential
to improve Southeast Michi-
gan's economy.
Larsen, who was the fac-
ulty leader of the food team on
University President Mary Sue
Coleman's sustainability ini-
tiative, said such relationships
could bring about a multiplier
effect in which aspects of agri-
culture production to consump-
tion within local frameworks
amplifies the effect on the local
economy.
"It's good to encourage or
retain the agricultural produc-
tion within this area," Larsen
said. "If we keep money locally,
it employs local people, it's good
for our local economy - those
have benefits."
Larsen said farm incubators
like the Intervale Center in Bur-
lington, Vt. are successful and
she hopes similar results can
be replicated in Ann Arbor. She
also said she foresees the future
start-ups at the Tilian Center
helping to achieve the Universi-

ty's goal of bringing in a portion
of its food from within 150 miles
of Ann Arbor.
"I know that the University is
interested in meeting their stat-
ed goal, so I don't see why not,"
Larsen said. "For the farmers to
know that there is a demand is
really powerful."
Notarianni said the demand
will be evident at the Ann Arbor
Farmers Market, where the
two vendors from Tilian Farms
already experienced success by
selling less popular vegetables.
"There is always more room
for people with innovative prod-
ucts at the Ann Arbor Farmers
Market," she said. "A lot of the
vendors who've been part of the
market for a really long time
don't really have children who
want to carry on their farms. So
I think that at sone point in the
next 10 to 15 years, there's going
to be a big change."
Notarianni thinks the grant
and the opportunities it will
spark might also help boost
enthusiasm about the Ann Arbor
Farmers Market and the local
pride and promise of sustain-
ability it represents.
"I think that there's a lot of
excitement and momentum
around local food in Washt-
enaw County and Southeast
Michigan, and continuing to fuel
that momentum will be good,"
Notarianni said.

Additionally, more than 34 per-
cent of freshmen students scored
between 31 and 36 on the ACT,
compared to 4 percent of students
across the country who scored in
that range.
"The bottom line is that the

Before last Saturday's game,
Michigan senior defensive line-
man Ryan Van Bergen said he
wanted Michigan State to run
right at him. The Spartans found
an easier way. They ran around
the Wolverines' beefy defensive
line.
Michigan State running back
Edwin Baker had four runs lon-
ger than 20 yardson the day.
Each came on carries to the out-
side.
The Spartans exposed the
Wolverines' secondary by run-
ning away from the line. And
after spending half the year try-
ing to separate itself from years
past, the secondary had an old
problem reappear at the most
inopportune time.
"I don't think we tackled
worth a darn," said Michigan
coach Brady Hoke on Monday. "I
don't think we played the perim-
eter of our defense worth a darn.
I don't think we took on blocks
and got off blocks and had very
good block protection."
Both safeties, redshirt sopho-
more Thomas Gordon and red-
shirt junior Jordan Kovacs, were
the most obvious culprits on
Baker's long runs.
But the damage could have
been worse. In the third quar-
ter, Baker had an open sideline
after a Gordon missed tackle
but dropped the ball. Michigan
recovered the fumble.
"They did a good job with
scheming us and knowing what
we were going to do and being
able to attack certain parts of
our defense," said senior defen-
sive tackle Mike Martin on Mon-
day. "(But) there's a new day and
(Tuesday) is a day we've got to

Senior defensive tackle Mike Martin and the rest of the Michigan defensive line

take advantage of."
The scheme has become a
recurring theme in the last two
weeks. Both of Michigan's oppo-
nents ran the ball to the outside
and neutralized the Wolverines'
strong defensive line.
But where Michigan State ran
the ball to the edge, Northwest-
ern tried to do it with the speed
option and bubble screens. In
both cases, success on the out-
side came from mistakes in the
secondary, either overrunning
plays or missing tackles.
With Michigan State's and
Northwestern's successes in
the first half, teams are likely to
attack the Wolverines' defense
with the blueprint the two
teams created. For Hoke, that
means using the bye week to
improve his team's now-incon-
sistent tackling technique and
prepare his defense to be more
equipped to handle plays to the

outside.
"I can assure you we can
work on block protection and
chop blocks and all those things
and make an emphasis," Hoke
said. "At the same time, there
were times where it was played
decently, but I didn't feel the
flow from our inside."
But after spending months
upon months working on tech-
nique and sprinting to the foot-
ball since, why did everything
break down at the worst pos-
sible moment? For Martin, it's
simple.
"They were able to make
moves on us when (bad tech-
nique) happened because we
weren't at the best we could
be," he said. "It's a focus. I think
guys get caught up in what the
other team is doing and not
(themselves).
"It's something that we can
fix, and that's a good thing."

Daily Sports Editor
John Beilein must feel like a
proud papa.
With six days of practice in
the books after team workouts
officially began last Friday,
the Michigan men's basketball
coach has already seen his expe-
rienced players doing their part
to help the wide-eyed freshmen
- one of the biggest tasks in the
early going. Beilein now has the
luxury of an experienced ros-
ter. It's a far cry from last year,
when the rebuilding Wolver-
ines entered the season with
no seniors and six first-year
players, most of whom were
expected to be needed on a
team believed to lack firepower.
This season, the task is
less onerous. Three scholar-
ship freshmen are joining the
roster, and two - freshmen
guards Trey Burke and Carl-
ton Brundidge - will likely be
counted on to help fill the void
left by Darius Morris, who left
for the NBA. Forward Max
Bielfeldt might also be called
upon for some added muscle
down low.
But Michigan has plenty of
other players who now have
experience, and they're help-
ing the new guys through their
growing pains.
"We've had incredible teach-
ers right now," Beilein said.
"This is a good problem to have
- we have too many people talk-
ing in the huddle.
"I had missed something
in film that (senior guard Stu
Douglass) picked up and said,
'Coach, can you show that one
time?' and then he said, 'Carl-
ton, that's what I was talking
about.' That's so good to have, so
we'll take this any time. "

Michigan senior forward Luke
Glendening shrugged in disbelief
after casually flicking the puck into
the net during a 10-3 win against
St. Lawrence on Thursday.
The goal was his third of the
game - his first hat trick as a Wol-
verine. And it looked so effortless.
There was the goal in the first
period that sparked the No. 1
Michigan hockey team's 10-goal
performance - a put-back off a
rebound from a shot by senior for-
ward David Wohlberg. Simple.
Then there was the feed by
Wohlberg in the second that left
half the goal open for Glenden-
ing. Easy. Later in the second,
the shrug-inducing goal came off
another rebound from a shot by
(you guessed it) Wohlberg.
And all Glendening could do
was smile like he stole something.
Of course, it wasn't as easy as
it looked. Michigan coach Red
Berenson said that Glendening is
one of the best on the team atscor-
ing from close range. That often
comes with a price.
"It can be brutal hockey when
you get into those areas," Beren-

son said. "Are you willing to pay
the price to go for a loose puck or
would you rather stay in the com-
fort zone? I think our team's doing
a good job of going to the net and
paying the price to score."
That opportunism has gone
a long way for the Wolverines'
offense. Offensive production
was the team's big question mark
entering the season.
That question mark has been
an exclamation point through the
first four games, largely thanks to
goals like Glendening's. Michigan
is averaging six goals per game,
good enough for the second-high-
est average in the nation.
Berenson said the Wolverines
take their cues from Glendening,
and that means dealing with some
pain to getthe goal.
"He is our best back-checker,
our hardest fore-checker and
most physical player and our
hardest worker," Berenson said
last Thursday. "When your cap-
tain is playing like that, then your
team cannot be far behind."
Putting up six goals per game
against teams like Niagara and
St. Lawrence far from guarantees
success in the CCHA, though.
After all, can Michigan continue

to rely heavily on opportunistic
goals?
Berenson said the game against
St. Lawrence was much closer
than the lopsided score indicated.
The difference was that the Wol-
verines' shots found the net.
CCHA goalies aren't likely to
allowgoalslikeGlendening'sthird,
when the rebound came off a shot
from behind the net as Wohlberg
tried to ricochet the puck off the
goalie. A CCHA goalie wouldn't
have let the puck squirt free. And
Michigan probably won't have
another opportunity to score three
goals against three different goal-
ies - as it did against St. Lawrence
- for many years.
"There's some luck involved,"
Berenson said. "You take those
point shots and sometimes they
go in, and sometimes they never
go in."
Still, goals off rebounds and
gritty play near the crease are a
large part of the game. Fearless-
ness in the crease can make a good
team great. And it's something
that can't really be coached.
"I think it's just a desire to be
there," Glendening said. "It's not
always the most enjoyable place
to be."

Beyond the basic brew at Ashley's
Tapping into the philosophy behind
Ann Arbor's own beer mecca
By Dhruv Madeka ( Daily Arts Writer . g I i'

Looking at the winding line
across its State Street entrance,
someone could easily confuse
Ashley's for an ordinary college
bar, one overcrowded with under-
graduates buying large pitchers of
PBR or Natty Ice.
Of course, the distinct and com-
pelling aroma that comes from
the range of craft beers offered
by the bar washes away most of
these assumptions. With a dimly
lit atmosphere whose retro feel
is only enhanced by the jukebox
standing in the corner, it's clear
that Ashley's is just not another
college bar. This establishment
doesn't deal much in generic
drinks - in fact, it doesn't even
keep Bud Light or Miller Lite on
tap - and it's become a stronghold
of the craft beer revolution in Ann
Arbor.

The craft beer movement
revolves around a deviation from
the mass-produced beverages
that currently dominate the sales
market. It's mainly comprised of
small, independent breweries that
produce a lower quantity of high
quality beer - exactly the kind
Ashley's retails.
As the winner of the 2011 click-
ondetroit.com Best Beer Selec-
tion award, Ashley's features
Ann Arbor's largest selection of
beers - 72 beers on tap and a con-
stantly changing rotating tap that
has 10 more options. These selec-
tions range from those meant to
appease the lager drinker, to more
full-bodied complex ones - all
ingrained with a variety of tastes
that include chocolaty, fruity and
bitter flavors. And these beers
aren't just from Michigan, either;

Ashley's has 72 beers on tap and a rotating tap with 10 additional options.

AN V E N N G WI T H


they hail from all over the world,
including countries as far as
Japan, Belgium and England.
one of Ashley's staff T-shirts
reads: "Friends don't let friends
drink cheap beer," and this is
certainly true of the establish-
ment. With the average pint
priced at about $5.25 and going
all the way up to $18, it isn't the
most inexpensive place to con-
sume a large quantity of beer.
Ashley's senior manager Carmen
Fernando believes this is part
of the reason it doesn't see too
many undergraduate visitors.
Maybe because the bar is more
often frequented by graduate
students and a generally older
crowd, it isn't loud and usually
has a more relaxed atmosphere
than Scorekeepers Sportsgrill
& Pub or Good Time Charley's.
However, Fernando believes
that as the craft movement has
grown, more and more under-
graduates are heading toward
the more sophisticated bar.
"I feel like it is beginning to

catch on with the undergraduates
because they do realize that it's a
matter of quality," Fernando said.
"You can come in here, and you
may pay $6 for a pint when you
could get a pitcher somewhere
else. ButI think that as the appre-
ciation of craft beer ... is growing,
we're getting a wider clientele."
The bar also features a number
of on-going promotional events
thatintend to celebrate the prover-
bial "beer snob." Its well-known
"Ultimate Beer Tour" is open to
anyone and rewards registered
participants for trying the wide
selection of Ashley's beverages.
An individual who tries more than
100 beers on the menu is deemed
a "Beer Hunter" and gets his or
her name etched on a board by the
entrance. The bar also sponsors
festivals throughout the year, like
Michigan Cask Ale Festival at its
larger satellite location in West-
land, Mich.
But Ashley's doesn't just wel-
come "beer snobs." If a student
walked into the bar and asked

the server for a recommendation,
that server would usually turn the
question back on the customer.
The server would then use the
bar's sample system to guide the
student toward a taste he or she
enjoyed, whether it's a malt beer
or a Belgian-ale with a distinct
fruity flavor.
"We don't want to serve you
what we like to drink." Fernando
said. "My staff is very educated
and very good at feeling each per-
son out. They may ask what they
usually drink, or what they're
used to drinking or what flavors
they're used to drinking. Because
we have such a range, you can
always find something that person
may like."
The walls of Ashley's are lined
with more beer bottles than even
a math major would dare count,
and they have all been sold at some
point in its 28 years in Ann Arbor.
Perhaps that's why Ashley's still
sees an influx of patrons from day
to day, even when students retreat
home for the holidays.

Is this real life? I think so.
What's real is that this phrase is
one of our generation's mecha-

spitting out prettiness and ugliness
all around us. We like the multiple

layers of reality in "Inception" and
the out-of-couch, ridiculous nature

Throwing down with the Spartans

It's not just the
academics that set us
apart from State
By CASSIE BALFOUR
Daily Community Culture Editor
When I told my dad, a Michi-
gan State.alum, that I was going
to East Lansing after the game
last Saturday, he advised me not
to wear University apparel. "It's
probably safer not to," he hinted
ominously. But when trekking
through State's sprawling campus,
I found my State brethren to be
in jolly moods, despite an absurd
amount of police presence. My
State friend had taken to point-
ing out the police slowly cruising
around East Lansing.
"There's another one," she dully
said approximately 25 times on our
45-minute exodus to a house party.
On Grand River Avenue, a large
stretch that eerily parallels our
State Street, the police were even
more apparent. Two mounted offi-
cers were clopping intimidatingly
past bars; those hellishly large
horses looked ready to curb-stomp
any bystander that got out of line.
I didn't witness any hoof-
stomping - but just because I have
no actual evidence doesn't mean
it doesn't happen. I don't really
think drunken revelers mix well
CAVERN
From Page 5B
Traditionally, it's the Killer Fla-
mingos, a pop-rock band of the
Detroit area, who take the stage
and get the crowd of a wide age
range grooving on their feet for
hours with covers of popular radio
songs like the Black Eyed Peas's "I
Gotta Feeling."
I wasn't as impressed with the
adjacent, Batman-themed bar
entitled Gotham City that exists as
a spooky and exciting atmosphere
with a mirror-walled dance floor
that lost its crowd to the live band
next door.
When Millennium isn't "hap-
pening" with live music, you can
almost always count on the people
flowing through Circus, if not just
for the cheap PBR and free perfect-
ly buttered popcorn. I appreciated

with even the most well-trained
equines, but it sure beats attempt-
ing to police State's gigantic cam-
pus on foot.
"The police presence is crazy -
there are like five different police
departments including campus
police that are out every week-
end," said one LSA junior. The stu-
dent, who transferred from State
to Michigan, chose to remain
anonymous because he is under-
age. He attributed the increased
police presence to State kids' par-
ty-prone ways.
After seeing the vast number of
police cars swarming the campus,
I contacted the Michigan State
University Police multiple times in
an effort to find out if the influx of
backup was simply due to the big
game. But unsurprisingly, no one
picked up the phone - probably
because they were all stationed
somewhere on campus.
Though I didn't witness the
police actually interacting with
students, I saw a few "fights" that
broke out due to wandering packs
of bloodthirsty State kids aggres-
sively heckling the poor University
bastards who were brave or stupid
enough to wear maize and blue.
A bright spot on this mass exo-
dus to party: The Campus Crusade
for Christ student group was sta-
tioned at an ordinary house party,
grilling "Jesus Dogs" to distribute
to hungry partiers. One campus
the karaoke stage but wished the
jukebox wasn't just decoration. A
lion's head appropriately emerges
from the circus tent that encases
the bar and five billiard tables
available for a free hour of play.
The most classic time to walk
those extra few blocks in your
boots is Wednesday nights. On
these evenings, there is always a
different and usually well-known
bluegrass band, leaving the top
floor of the complex sweaty with
the beautiful grunge of music
lovers with taste for less popular
music styles.
"I think because of the large
number of grandchildren of the
'60s - the children of the 1960s
children in town, who are into
bluegrass, we've found a niche
audience," Easton said.
Despite the turn-off of cover
charges, the atmosphere's unpre-
dictability and the walk in typical-

crusader said he just wanted to
make sure people were drink-
ing on a full stomach and staying
safe. Even though the stereotype
is that East Lansing is crazy, many
seemed to be on the lookout for
others.
The visible police presence may
be more pronounced at State, but
wayward Michigan kids should
take comfort in the fact that East
Lansing and Ann Arbor have many
similarities. They both have a Pot-
belly, an American Apparel and
some zany, sign-wielding zealots
who preach on street corners. The
fire and brimstone-breathing old
guys standing on literal soapboxes
in downtown Ann Arbor condemn-
ing random passersby are appar-
ently a franchise.
They've also been dispatched to
East Lansing to assure the Spar-
tans they are also going to rot in
hell for a whole litany of "sins."
East Lansing is definitely not lack-
ing in folksy charm.
But there exist differences
between the nightlife at the two
rival universities, as many wide-
eyed University of Michigan kids
have discovered in East Lansing.
A State sophomore who grew
up in Ann Arbor and preferred not
to be identified as a drinker con-
firmed that in East Lansing, stu-
dents have to pay five dollars per
cup at a party.
"People party a lot more in East
ly frigid weather, the Cavern Club
environment embraces adults of
all ages trying to have a memora-
ble night of play.
"We're really just far enough
away from campus - about a mile
- that we appeal to a lot of town-
ies and working grad students,"
Easton said. "So it's just a little bit
older age group on up and that's
another reason why students feel
comfortable bringing their par-
ents here, because their parents
don't feel like grandma and grand-
pa walking around."
It turns out though the estab-
lishment has a couple of shortcom-
ings, the ability to show up and
have a good time before turning 21
is a turn-on to many. There is a lot
more adventure to offer than the
average party joint with the mul-
tiple themed options, especially
on its biggest night of the year:
Halloween.

Lansing, so it's sort of the price of
admission," she said.
But in a lot of ways, State kids
are just like us. They require post-
party fuel in order to trek back
home after a night of revelry. The
entire party scene revolves around
one street - Grand River, in their
case. And they have a Panchero's,
too.
But where we found the real
after-party was at the packed
double decker McDonald's on the
outskirts along Grand River. There
was a line to get into the golden
arches with an exasperated, elderly
security guard acting as a bouncer.
The tired, sad-eyed man attempted
to control the scene, but people

spilled into the establishment in
waves of green and white.
Another one of the ever-pres-
ent security guards was stationed
upstairs peering warily down at
the hordes of hungry students jos-
tling over their place in line, and
the workers behind the counter
patiently repeated orders back
to their slurring customers. And
when one blurry-eyed patron
decked out in Spartan colors asked
if he could have the rest of my fries,
I felt a sense of camaraderie with
our (little) brother school. They
aren't so different from us - but if
you come, come mounted on your
own police steed, because serious-
ly, that campus is huge.

BAR LOUIE
401 East Liberty Street
You can't just order a plain martini at Bar
Louie. For a martini with gin, you have to
order The Abbey, which contains a mix of
Hendricks, fresh grapefruit, pure cane syrup,
grenadine and a lemon rind garnish that
accents the glass. The $9 drink is definitely
for the ladies, but don't be deceived by its pink
tint. The gin overpowers the sweet grapefruit
flavor and leaves a strong alcoholic taste.
THE BLACK PEARL
302 South Main Street
You're not just ordering a martini at The
Black Pearl - you're ordering a classy eve-
ning. Rather than daunting, the lengthy
martini menu opens up a wide array of pos-
sibilities. The signature martini achieves
that delicate balance of sweet, sipable flavor
with enough alcohol to keep the conversation
flowing. With the swanky atmosphere and
drink in your hand, you can't go wrong here.

SAVA'S
211 South State Street
Martinis are a secret special at Sava's,
not on the menu but available to those in the
know. However, the gin martini here doesn't
go down smoothly at all. It tastes more like
straight gin than watered-down gin with ver-
mouth ... thoughgranted, there's already afine
distinction to be made there. It's not hard to
believe this joint got its liquor license just last
year - clearly, it's a learning process.
RED HAWK
316 South State Street
Red Hawk's version of the gin martini on
the rocks is three ounces of pure pleasure.
This drink is smooth from start to finish.
Their basic well martini costs just over $7
and is served with Bombay gin rather than
the darling of rapper Snoop Dogg (and for-
mer Red Hawk well gin), Tanqueray. The
drink is inexpensive, full of alcohol and
smooth. Bond would be proud.

But little time is allotted for

a cheery ditty. From that point
on, "Deconstruction" is dance-

The music video features the

A walk on A2's cheap-eat streets

When the lights go
down, restaurants
have to multitask
By ARIELLE SPECINER
DailyArts Writer
The average night of a 'U' student
follows a typical pattern: Pregame,
party and then get hungry. As some
people's stomachs start growling,
there is always that one person who
yells, "Dudes! Let's get some food!"
This individual is now dubbed roy-
ally awesome, and his or her faith-
ful lieges stumble behind to the
nearest late-night establishment.
That's when my night gets
interesting.
I arrive at Brown Jug on South
University Avenue on a Friday at
10:40 p.m. It's not terribly crowd-
ed, but Iknow it will be inthe later
hours. I go to check out the pre-
game drinks and the meals that
go with them. Most students are
starting their nights with pizza,
burgers or fries.
Cheers and whoops clamor as
one member of a group to my right
flips a quarter into a cup of beer.
He drinks. They socialize with the
waiters as they become increas-
ingly drunk, then finally order
some Brown Jug grub.

I spoke to manager Joshua San-
chez about Brown Jug's smaller
but just as significant store, Back-
room Pizza.
Backroom, located at 605
Church Street, is an Ann Arbor
late-night staple. Sanchez
explained that on a Friday night,
it sells about 500 slices of pizza
between 1:40 a.m. and 2:40 a.m.
That hour is essential to the
business. At this point, the crowd
mainly consists of bar-dwellers
who've had enough partying and
are ready to sober up with some
delicious carbohydrates. And the
location couldn't be better.
"It's serendipitous," Sanchez
said. "We've benefited greatly from
being between three of the most
popular bars. I think (Backroom) is
one of the three places people think
of when they say, 'Oh I'm drunk, I
wanna eat.'
Because the bars are so close
to Backroom, the eating estab-
lishment witnesses some rowdier
times. Sanchez said customers cut
the line often, step on people's feet
and get in the way of others. But
the bouncers brought over from the
Brown Jug keep everyone in check
and make sure that everyone gets
their rightful portions of pizza -
pepperoni is the most popular.
There is also the issue of over-
payment and underpayment - stu-

dents who are under the influence
may not be aware of the money
they are taking out of their wal-
lets and pay less or more than the
necessary amount for food. At
Backroom, students who throw
cash at the pizza-makers may not
be aware that they've only given
a dollar instead of the $1.25 that a
slice now costs. Sanchez explained
the heightened security helps
prevent this from happening at
Backroom, but at Brown Jug, wait-
ers typically ask for a credit card
when parties order so they don't
just drink and dash.
"People are bummed out about
(the price hike), it's so easy to pay
with a dollar," Sanchez said. "As a
customer, that would put me out a
little bit."
But a dollar and a quarter for a
slice at 3:00 a.m. is still cheaper
than other campus pizza places.
Sanchez told me if I wanted to
get the true Backroom experience,
I should headback at 1:30 a.m.With
that in mind, and with pre-gamers
starting to clear out, it's my turn to
leave, too.
At about 12:30 a.m., I check out
the goings on just up the block at
Panchero's Mexican Grill. I'm not
sure if it's the Mexican atmosphere,
but there are alot of people in cow-
boy gear.
Panch is a sight to see. At 1:00

you can hear the unanimous "Let's
go to Panch!" yells across campus.
Toward the late-night establish-
ment, those leaders start walking.
I'm sitting at a table by the door
to see who will come in. A few
girls walk in - their eyes glazed
over with hunger - along with the
guys who know the quickest way
to win a drunk girl's heart is buy-
ing her a chicken burrito. People
are sitting in booths, hunched over
their burritos as if someone were to
come snatch them away. It isn't the
rowdy crowd I intended to see, but
it's entertaining nonetheless.
I sit down with one of the cooks,
Fredo Cortez, to hear what typi-
cally occurs on a Friday night.
"It's hard sometimes because
people come drunk and try to
speak Spanish, but most of the time
they're not right," Cortez said.
He said that Panchero's makes
about $9,000 a night, mostly from
burrito sales from 1:00 to2:00 a.m.,
with another burst of sales at 2:30
a.m.
"This season, football season,
people drink at the games and so
we have the lines out the door on
Friday and Saturdays," Cortez said.
Though I missed it, Cortez said
the post-bar crowd that often visits
Panchero's is a little crazier than
the one at Backroom. He said peo-
ple dance on the tables and even get

in fights. That's when the employ-
ees have to step in and break them
up.
"We have to make the food and
also watch the crowd," Cortez said.
There are no table dance-offs or
brawls, so I check my watch - it
reads 1:45 a.m. Time to head back
to Backroom for the crowd.
The stacks of ready-to-cook
pizza I saw the workers prepar-
ing earlier that night are being
devoured.
The line wraps around the build-
ing. People are throwing their
plates like Frisbees, a slice falls on
the floor and girls with no shoes on
walk up and down the sidewalk. As
amusing as all of this is, it's 2:15 a.m.
and I'm exhausted. I leave.
By day, a restaurant's focus is the
quality of the food. But when the
sun goes down, it transforms into
something more, with employees
simultaneously breaking up fights
and flipping pizzas at the speed
of light. Though getting the food
out is important, crowd control is
equally imperative. These tough,
multitalented purveyors of late-
night food must keep that in mind
while watching over a restaurant in
the early morning hours.
And though I leave to go to sleep
and ponder these thoughts, the
night has barely begun for these
hungry, late-night partygoers.

What do you picture when you hear the
phrase "Michigan nightlife?"
People streaming out of the bars on South U in
all hours of the night.
What's your favorite late night food?
I'd probably have to go with Panchero's.
What's the best thing on their menu?
Cheese quesadilla - it's simple, but it still has
that grease factor. And it tastes really good and
fresh.
If you were a martini, what kind would you be?
I'd probably be the dirty martini. Very strong,
extra olives.

Layers of glitz in Cavern complex

By LEAH BURGIN
Senior Arts Editor
Everyone went bananas when
"Glee" hit the small screen two
years ago, hooking the shower
singers, the high school drama
queens and critics alike. And if the
show itself wasn't enough to blow
your socks off, the music sure did:
Each of the "Glee" albums (except
the soundtrack from "Glee: The
3D Concert Movie") hit within the
top five on Billboard. It seemed as
if "Glee" had finally created the
ultimate combination of music
and TV.
But no matter how special
"Glee" might seem, the concept of
mixing music performance and TV
was popular before everyone on
the show (except Jane Lynch) was
conceived. And if it had been con-
ceptualized back in the late 1960s

the stage like Rachel. In fact, a
lot of the songs off It's a Sunshine
Day are just plain awful. There
is an annoyingly sweet (and out
of place) rendition of "Frosty the
Snowman" and a shortened, ter-
ribly off-tune and completely
lackluster take on Don McClean's
immortal "American Pie." These
songs are so bad that they some-
how end up being good.
More than that, though, they
represent nostalgia for me in a
different sense than the nostal-
gia "Glee" evokes: I remember
my grade-school self jumping up
and down on my bed singing the
Bunch's "Cheyenne" into a hair-
brush; I remember geeking out
over "Glee" with my roommate
my freshman year in our prison
cell-sized dorm room. Similar to
my disinterest in watching "The
Brady Bunch," "Glee" as a TV
series has lost all appeal to me, but
I'll still listen to the "Glee" station
on Pandora when I need some fun
music to study to.
This is the fate of music/
TV hybrids - "The Monkees,"
"The Brady Bunch," "Glee," even
"Flight of the Conchords." These
shows entertain for awhile, but
which do you do more often:
watch the shows, or listen to the
tunes? The beat goes on.

t's highly rare that 24 hours
SinAnn Arbor will roll by
without a person coming
in contact with "Is this real
life?" If not that phrase exactly,
slight adapta-
tions of it are
expressed
- but always
familial ones,
like a jaguar to
a lion: unreal,
not real, real
life. A lot of JULIA
times, I may SMITH-
not even be EPPSTEIER
receiving the
information
through my ears, but through the
visual world of social media - par-
ticularly in the form of hashtags on
Twitter.
Why do we do this? I'm fairly
positive it isn't our generation
harkening back to "Bohemian
Rhapsody." We are not Queen dis-
cussing remorse, but it's unclear
what we are doing. Unlike the
trend of "Keep Calm and (fill-in-
the-blank-here)," which originates
from the World War II morale-
boosting posters producedby the
British government, the trend of
#isthisreal has no home.
But no home doesn't mean no
parent. I think there is a very
distanced parent of this trend - a
young boy named David who got
high on Novocain, his terrify-
ing but hilarious reaction to the
drug made public when his father
scored footage of it and uploaded it
to YouTube. "David After Dentist"
went viral in 2009, featuring the
boy asking his dad the questions,
"Why is this happening to me? Is
this going to be forever?" and most
importantly,-"Is this real life?"
More than 100 million people
watched David's wise question,
leading me to believe that this is
not an orphaned trend, but rather
one that started with the child's
sincere moment and has since
been unleashed on Generation
Y. #Isthisreal appears to have
reached its current state as its own
sensation, running wild on social
media.
The phrase is first and foremost
used to question and comment on
the minor absurdities in our lives.

Many times when Iread or hear
the variations of this "real life?,"
it is referencing an excruciatingly
long day, an excessively difficult
exam or anything overwhelming
going on in a person's life. It's not-
ing something negative, perhaps
a certain level of stress or exhaus-
tion because of the specific situ-
ation, and maybe expressing it to
the public makes one feel better
about his or her life, which is so
busy that it can't be real.
It's comedic, though, because
when asking, "Is this real?," there
is a great possibility thatthe
person inquiring thinks that the
subject in question is not real or
normal-seeming, but rather ridicu-
lous and #unreal.
Yes, this is real
life. Since you're
wondering.
When the phrases aren't in ref-
erence to an impressive amount of
work, they are likely referencing
an impressive amount of party-
ing. Whether it's that fifth tequila
shot or the trippy light show at the
Deadmau5 concert, it's typically
something enough to deem the
evening far from reality. But things
seem to be "not real" so often for
late teens and early 20-somethings
in present day that the phrase
might be losing meaning before
owning anything definitive to
begin with.
Anytime I hear the hypotheti-
cal question fall out my mouth or
anyone else's, I want to say, "Yes,
of course it's real. We are alive and
tangible." But the idea is valid in
a big way. Life can get fairly crazy
and be worthy of takinga step
back and asking about its nature:
How are you, yourself, interacting
with the crazy world?
Little kids ask the essential
question numerous times a day in
their own simplified ways. They
wonder about almost everything
they see, hear, touch, smell and
experience. Something that is full

Four clubs stacked
up with cages, live
tunes and popcorn

A place where Greek Life
comes to grind, hipsters come
to sway and older folks come to
not feel like grandparents does
exist - it's called Cavern Club
Entertainment Complex and
it's a bit out of the way from
the normal nightlife spots. Ann
Arbor is a town geared toward
the crazy disposition of college
students, and places like Rick's
American Cafe and Scorekeep-
ers Sports Grill & Pub are the
obvious answers to the nightlife
dilemma. But there happens to
be an underexposed alternative
a block past Main Street. The
club may have a mere 20-per-
cent college student demograph-
ic, but Jason Segel and Emily
Blunt jammed to the DJ's beats
there during the filming of "The
Five-Year Engagement" this

past summer. Nick Easton, the
owner of the complex, manages
the four eclectic bars within the
building: listed from bottom on
up, Cavern Club, Millennium
Club, Gotham City and Circus
Bar & Billiards.
Easton's life trajectory has
changed wildly - he began his
career as an elementary school
teacher and is now the success-
ful manager of a quartet of con-
nected clubs.
"I wanted to be my own boss,"
Easton said. "I had that entre-
preneurial spirit and I'm inter-
ested in histories, so I started an
antique store here back in '94. I
bought this building and it just
kind of evolved over time."
The place that currently
houses the complex's Cavern
Club used to contain antique
items, but Easton took it upon
himself to convert the space
into a banquet hall. After this
was well received, he took it a
step. further by getting a liquor
license and remodeling. More
than a decade later, it seems the
transformation was a wise one.
Now the Cavern Club, which
is rented out for private soirees

like sorority-fraternity date par-
ties and events for the dental
school and the business school,
resembles nothing I've seen
before.
As I walked into the under-
ground club, I was confronted
by a deer head hanging from the
wall, twinkle lights in garland
outlining the bar and over-sex-
ualized modern grinding juxta-
posed up against a large painting
that echoes Michelangelo's The
Creation. That made the place
feel like a Christmas cabin
gone wrong. All of that said, the
cherry on top was that the DJ
seemed to have a man crush on
Usher. Frankly, the club is the
perfect place to givea handful of
disposable cameras an authentic
night out on the town.
Venturing upstairs, I found
myself amid the neon lights of
the Millennium Club walking
by cages, a glittery fish tank and
empty poles seen in the front
window. These used to be alive
with hired dancers back when
the club launched in 2000. This
particular venue is open on Sat-
urdays, when a live band plays.
