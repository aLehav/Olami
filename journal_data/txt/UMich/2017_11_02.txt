After 
confirmation 
that 

prominent 
white 
supremacist 

Richard Spencer requested to speak 
at the University of Michigan, the 
NAACP and Black Student Union 
released 
statements 
requesting 

action to bar Spencer from speaking.

The Black Student Union sent a 

letter to University President Mark 
Schlissel and the Board of Regents 

Tuesday night that demanded 
Schlissel deny Spencer’s request, 
especially in light of recent racist 
events on campus.

“Allowing such a person to 

speak on this campus is a threat to 
the physical and emotional safety 
of many students on campus,” 
the letter read. “Too many times 
already have students of color been 
placed under emotional distress due 
to racist campus climate.”

With the University set to take 

part in a weeklong summit to 
examine the Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion plan, the letter explained 

the hypocrisy in advocating for a 
welcome and secure environment 
yet allowing speakers like Charles 
Murray and potentially Spencer on 
campus. Furthermore, the letter 
explained worries about potential 
violence if Spencer were to speak 
— schools including the University 
of Florida and Michigan State 
University have denied Spencer’s 
request to speak in order to protect 
their students’ safety.

“Richard Spencer is a violent 

white supremacist who advocates 
ethnic cleansing, and while he may 
deny promoting physical violence, 

his supporters engage in violence 
against marginalized people with 
the intent of protecting white 
supremacy,” the letter continued. 
“His rally in Charlottesville this 
summer drew hundreds of armed 
protesters that resulted in the 
murder of a Ms. Heyer. His rhetoric 
is nothing less than hate speech 
and goes against everything the 
University claims has no place on 
this campus.”

The 
University 
already 

offers 
countless 
research 

opportunities in its 19 schools 
and colleges. But on Wednesday, 
over 250 of the University’s 
interdisciplinary 
research 

teams, were able to showcase 
this work. 

The 
MCubed 
Symposium 

consisted of teams referred to 
as “cubes” as they are headed 
by 
three 
faculty 
members 

from at least two different 
disciplines. 
Launched 
in 

2012, MCubed has an online 
system that streamlines the 
process of professors securing 
funding. This platform, and its 
multidisciplinary 
approach, 

allows 
for 
groundbreaking, 

innovative research.

During 
the 
symposium’s 

opening remarks, University 
of Michigan President Mark 
Schlissel 
discussed 
the 

importance of using different 
fields in crafting solutions to 
problems.

“The biggest problems we face 

in society don’t conveniently set 
themselves up to be knocked 
down by one-source solutions,” 
Schlissel said. “Problems don’t 
know what disciplines they’re 
supposed to fall under. They’re 
just problems.”

The keynote speaker was 

Francis Collins, the director 
of the National Institutes of 
Health. He discussed new NIH 
programs, including one called 

“All of Us” that aims to engage 
diverse participants in making 
discoveries in medical research. 
Collins 
applauded 
MCubed 

for incentivizing researchers 
from different fields to work 
together.

“One of the challenges we all 

have in medical research is that 
it often feels like herding cats,” 
he said. “The MCubed program 
can get the cats moving.”

The 
symposium 
featured 

several “cubes,” with members 
of each team describing their 
research. One of these cubes 
was “Digitizing Orson Welles’ 
Heart of Darkness.” Orson 
Welles proposed a movie to 
production 
company 
RKO 

Pictures to be based on Joseph 
Conrad’s 
novel 
“Heart 
of 

Darkness.” This project was 
ultimately shelved and adapted 
into “Citizen Kane,” one of 
Welles’s most famous movies. 

This cube’s purpose was to 
make the historical materials 
behind the unmade “Heart of 
Darkness” movie available to 
the public by digitizing them. 
Rackham 
student 
Vincent 

Longo, a member of the “cube,” 
discussed the goals of the 
team’s research.

Ann Arbor’s last odd-year City 

Council elections will take place 
this upcoming Tuesday, Nov. 7. 
The Michigan Daily sat down 
with six of the eight candidates to 
discuss platforms and how local 
races impact University students. 

Ward 2
Jared Hoffert (D)
I think one of the biggest 

issues facing Ann Arbor for 
the 
future 
is 
that 
supply 

and demand issue. It affects 
everyone: it affects residents, 
it affects students … the best 
possible solution for this right 
now is that you have to develop 
and redevelop. You need to make 
units available because keeping 
it constant where it’s at will just 
affect the supply and demand 
and cost because if there’s 
nothing there, the rents or costs 
of buying a house will keep just 
skyrocketing and make it less 
and less affordable.

During 
the 
Bicentennial 

celebrations, students, staff and 
alumni caught a glimpse into the 
University of Michigan’s past 
quite literally with the augmented 
reality application MGoView. The 
app’s users toured 30 historic sites 
around campus, spotting flying 
cars, woolly mammoths and even 
former President John F. Kennedy.

MGoView’s project manager, 

Evan Hoye, described the way in 
which the application, released 
in May 2017, relates to the 
Bicentennial.

“The 
University 
is 
looking 

toward 
its 
third 
century 
as 

it discusses the past two,” he 
explained.

MGoView offers users detailed 

historical tours of the University 
while incorporating cutting-edge 
technology.

“(The) goal was to focus on the 

future and to look at what’s on 
these borderlands of technology 
and how we can bring that to a 
mainstream audience.”

Business 
senior 
Matthew 

Mansour has reported to the 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
and University of Michigan 
authorities that he has been 
harassed 
and 
discriminated 

against by his roommates after 
coming out as gay several weeks 
ago on social media.

Mansour, 
who 
lives 
in 

Landmark, said his roommates 
had been threatening him and 
his therapy dog ever since they’d 
discovered they would be living 
with the emotional support 
animal, and this manifested 
in them urinating in the dog’s 
water bowl and verbally abusing 
it.

“I came out on social media 

on National Coming Out Day, 
and it was kind of difficult, 
but I had a lot of support from 
my community and friends.” 
Mansour said. “But the next day 
I was packing for Fall Break, 
(my roommate) came home, 
started banging on the wall and 

screaming, ‘All gays go to hell.’ 
He was using gay slurs and made 
some disgusting, homophobic 
comments. This happened that 
night and I was really afraid, and 
I left to Denver for fall break.”

While Mansour was away 

he had a friend come in to 
pick something up from the 
apartment, where she found 
$680 worth of his belongings — 
including his kitchenware and 
his dog supplies — were missing.

“Everything 
was 
gone,” 

Mansour said. “We found out 
that it had been thrown out the 
window. My bedroom door had 
knife marks all over it. He had 
a knife and he was trying to get 
into my room by stabbing the 
door and stabbing the handle.”

Mansour 
believes 
one 
of 

his roommates was the main 
perpetrator, though there were 
co-conspirators. That roommate 
says his friend caused most of 
the damage and was the one who 
destroyed Mansour’s belongings.

University of 

Michigan alum James 
Earl Jones is slated to 
play Mufasa in Disney’s 
live-action remake 
of “The Lion King,” 
scheduled to come 
out in July 2019. He’ll 
be acting alongside 
Beyonce Knowles-
Carter as Nala and 
Donald Glover as 
Simba.

He is the first actor 

to reprise his role in 
a live-action Disney 
remake.

Jones graduated 

in 1955 from the 
University, where he 
originally planned on 
being a pre-med major 
before transferring to 
the School of Music, 

Theatre & Dance after 
deciding his passion 
was not medicine.

While at the 

University, Jones 
was a member of the 
ROTC, and part of the 
Scabbard and Blade 
Honor Society. Jones 
has acted in severable 
notable roles since 
then, most memorably 
as Darth Vader in “Star 
Wars” and Mufasa in 
the original animated 
“Lion King.”

Fans are excited at 

the prospect of seeing 
Jones act alongside 
some of their favorite 
celebrities.

LSA Student Government held 

its weekly meeting Wednesday 
evening in Mason Hall to discuss 
final examination policy and 
making Election Day a potential 
academic holiday.

LSA SG passed a resolution 28 

to 0 in favor of supporting better 
enforcement by the University 
of Michigan ensuring faculty 
members abide by the final 
examination slot they are assigned 
to by the Office of the Registrar.

President Nicholas Fadanelli 

and Vice President Ryan Gillcrist, 
LSA seniors, and LSA junior 
Hanna 
Simmons, 
sponsored 

the resolution and discussed 
their 
concerns 
that 
many 

faculty members hold their final 
examinations during the last 
day of classes rather than their 
allotted time slot, potentially 
threatening student rights to 
alternate examination times.

They 
also 
recommended 

policies be changed to allow 
students to request alternate exam 
times when they have more than 
two exams in one day, instead of 
the current policy of more than 
three per day.

“This is not only University 

policy that final examinations 
be held in the scheduled spot, 
but it’s also compiled in the LSA 
Faculty 
Code, 
the 
governing 

document of the college of LSA 
... I think the fact that they’re 
violating the document that they 
approve (themselves), that in any 

other circumstance they hold 
high above their heads when it 
comes to us doing anything to 
them that they might not fly by it 
… that doesn’t fly well with me,” 
Fadanelli said.

Fadanelli also gave an update 

on Richard Spencer’s request to 
speak at the University. Spencer 
is a noted white supremacist 
who the University confirmed 
requested to speak but neither 
approved nor denied his request.

“At this time, although I have 

not 
heard 
anything 
official, 

if I were to take a wild guess 
the University will most likely 
approve him speaking, as in let 
him have a space … whether or 
not there will be a counter-event 
sponsored by the University or 
an accommodation of the event 

while also still allowing it, I 
am not aware of at this time,” 
Fadanelli said.

The group also passed a 

resolution 27 to 1 regarding an 
amendment to the 18th chapter 
of its bylaws for better flexibility 
for its election policies, as well 
as making amendments to its 
ballot questions for its upcoming 
elections on Nov. 20 and 21.

The 
government 
also 

welcomed a speaker on behalf of 
the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and 
Awareness 
Center, 
LSA 

senior Nora Akcasu. Akcasu 
discussed SAPAC’s influence on 
campus and its relationship with 
LSA SG.

Sinigang for the sentimental Ivy League stew

Classified yet obvious: room for sale, dm for details

Making Filipino food is to 

retell a story of my culture 
— 
complex, 
humbling 
and 

personal.

Sinigang is a classic Filipino 

sour soup with a variety of 
vegetables that are reminiscent 
of a Filipino farm. It’s the 
warm 
hug 
that 
withholds 

its 
sentimental, 
cultural 

significance in times of a harsh 
Midwest winter.

Prep time: approximately 15 
minutes

Cook 
time: 
whenever 
my 

parents said the sinigang is 
ready. I used to call to ask 
my parents when I made it by 
myself.

Total time: my whole existence 
as a Filipino American, because 
I never stop questioning it.

Note: best prepared with 

Filipino 
parents 
at 
home, 

because they are the best 
cooks in the entire world and 
all-knowing when it comes 
to Filipino cuisine, but you 
reserve the right to disagree 
with them on other things. 

Ingredients

• Meat 
(pork 
or 
salmon 

are my favs, but if you’re 
going to use salmon, it’s 
absolutely necessary that 
you use the salmon head. 
Go big and go home.), cubed 

• Tubig (water)
• Patis (fish sauce, but always 

use the one with the green 
and white label because it 
reminds you of home)

• Kangkong leaves
• Sili (long green chili pepper, 

the best ones come from the 
garden in the backyard), 
whole

• Kamatis 
(tomato, 
the 

best ones also come from 
the same garden in the 
backyard)

• Labanos (daikon radish), 

sliced

• Taro root, peeled and sliced
• Sinigang 
seasoning 
mix, 

because no one has time 
to 
make 
sinigang 
from 

scratch. 
(You 
can 
find 

packets at your local Asian 
grocery store. My local 
Asian grocery store was 50 
minutes away. I recommend 
Knorr or Mama Sita, but I 
usually just trust whatever 
my mom or dad picked out. 
Sampalok, 
or 
taramind, 

is the best flavor in my 
opinion.)

• Sorry but I never learned 

exact quantities, because 
my parents cooked by feel 
and I carried that technique 
throughout life.

Instructions

1. 
Fill a large pot with water 
and bring to a boil.

2. 
Put the meat into the 
boiling pot of water.

3. 
Wait for a long time, so 
long that you wonder the 
odds of ending up in the 
cold Midwest when your 
family comes from a hot 
and humid archipelago.

4. 
Become 
even 
more 

hungry.

5. 
Add the taro root and 
kamatis. 
Make 
sure 

you cook it all the way, 
because you heard from 
a Filipino friend that raw 
taro root is poisonous.

6. 
Skim the fat out of the 
broth.

7. 
Question 
why 
your 

parents never told you raw 
taro root was poisonous 
and how they knew it was 
properly cooked.

8. 
Question the legitimacy 
of your Filipino friend’s 
sources on taro root.

9. 
Add the sinigang mix and 
patis. Stir occasionally. 

10. Put the daikon radish into 

the soup.

11. Put the celi in.

12. Listen to your parents talk 

to each other in Ilocano 
and wonder what they’re 
talking about.

13. Add the kangkong leaves, 

one for each time you said 
thank you to your parents 
for giving you your life — 
a lot but not enough.

14. Wait for a little bit, but 

not 
too 
long 
because 

overcooked 
kangkong 

leaves are the worst.

15. Enjoy with rice. Always 

enjoy 
everything 
with 

rice. 
It’s 
also 
not 
a 

complete meal without it.

16. Cherish each spoonful, 

because despite moving 
from small town to small 
town, your family has 
preserved 
the 
Filipino 

culture regardless. 

17. Go home for Fall Break, 

for 
Thanksgiving, 
for 

Christmas, or every time 
you felt defeated and rest 
easy to the fact you have 
your family and a hot pot 
of sinigang ready. 

18. Make 
baon. 
Take 
the 

leftovers with you.

19. Take 
the 
strength 

of 
your 
family, 
their 

achievements, 
their 

sacrifice, and use that as 
your drive to fight.

20. Try your best to make 

sinigang 
when 
you’re 

away at college, but know 
that your sinigang is levels 
beneath your parents’and 
smile at the fact that 
they’re just happy you 
tried your best.

21. Find 
Filipino 

communities everywhere. 
Eat their sinigang. Each 
rendition is similar yet 
different.

22. Share 
your 
recipe 
as 

if it were a page out of 
your autobiography. It’s 
something to be proud of.

23. Make 
Filipino 
food 

whenever you can, not 
just sinigang, in symbolic 
honor of your parents’ 
sacrifices for you. 

24. Remember that Filipino 

American 
history 
isn’t 

always 
academic. 
It’s 

weaved into the recipes 
and lessons your family 
passed down to you.

Best prepared 
with Filipino 

parents at home

Last week, I was in an 

argument. 
Although 
no 

punches were thrown, I felt 
like I got slapped in the face a 
few times, but I thought I did 
the best I could. Even though 
I was ducking and weaving 
through the racist rhetoric, it 
still felt like I got my ass beat. 
As soon as it ended, I went 
upstairs to my room, pulled the 
covers over my head, and cried. 

Now, I know I’m the only 

Black kid in my house.

Most days, I think I can 

handle anything.

But obviously, I can’t. And 

I should’ve known that. Even 
my grandma thought I was 
crazy when I said I was going 
to live with four white girls 
in a house my junior year 
of college. She knew that I 
didn’t really understand that 
being Black in a white house 
means constantly walking on 
eggshells, and making sure not 
to draw too much attention to 
your most prominent feature: 
your blackness. Ah, if anything, 
I’d like to ask Michelle and 
Barack… but they can’t come 
to the phone right now so I’m 
constantly 
stuck 
on 
mine. 

Scrolling, trying to muster up 

the strength to go to class.

And since, I have come to 

one conclusion.

C.C. Little and Angell are 

not the only problems the 
University of Michigan needs 
to confront.

The University needs to 

address and hold accountable 
the assailants whom bleed out 
the soul, compassion and fight 
of the Black students.

Because there aren’t any 

dead men coming to evict me.

But these little white girls 

are doing everything in their 
power to make sure I don’t stay.

It felt as though they kicked 

me repeatedly while I was 
down; I had just lived through 
a week of white supremacist 
posters were affixed to campus 
structures. The word “n****r” 
was being written on the backs 
of Black students’ dorm doors, 
screamed at a group of students 
and posted on Snapchat by 
groups of white kids.

You all want to be able to say 

the word “n***a” in your snaps, 
songs and at your parties, but 
do you realize you use n***as 
every day?

We write the music you 

blast at frat parties. We create 
the culture you steal. Kim 
Kardashian came on the scene, 
and now everyone wants the 
fat ass that was exhibited as 

a “freak show attraction” on 
numerous Black women, most 
famously 
Sarah 
Baartman, 

in circuses during the 1800s. 
Kylie Jenner has made the 
big pouty lips (which pushed 
pseudo 
scientists 
to 
argue 

Black people were closer to 
apes) attractive. And Katy 
Perry has toldyou it’s okay to 
wear cornrows, despite the 
discrimination Black people 
encounter in schools and the 
job market when they wear 
them. 

Additionally, 
many 
of 

you all exploit Black people 
for a chance to reinvigorate 
the 
white 
savior 
complex 

passed down to you from 
your 
imperialist 
ancestors. 

You volunteer for Teach for 
America so you can have a feel-
good résumé booster. Yet you 
don’t know a damn thing about 
the inner city or its trials.

And I’m that n***a a lot 

of you at the University use. 
Somehow, somewhere along 
the way, I became your Negro 
— the proof to your friends and 
family that you aren’t racist.

Yet, you watched as I was 

verbally assaulted.

While I crafted intellectual, 

academic 
arguments 
from 

the 
Pew 
Research 
Center, 

academic 
journals 
and 

personal 
anecdotes, 
my 

roommate repeatedly told me 
systemic prejudice no longer 
exists — that my experiences 
were 
superficial 
and 
fake. 

That white and Black people 
move throughout the world 
in the same way — insinuated 
that institutional racism and 
systematic injustice are simply 
in my imagination — that I have 
a “chip on my shoulder” and 
racism is only as meaningful as 
I let it be.

I sleep in a bed 29 inches 

from my other roommate. Yet 
somehow, even though she 
saw me hurting and upset, she 
couldn’t muster the strength 
to say, “Stop”? Or, “She’s had 
enough”?

You saw my eyes watering. 

Hands shaking. Lip quivering 
from the anger I felt as she 
dismissed my statistics and 
data.

But you complained that I 

was making too much noise as 
she made slight after slight.

We were “disturbing” your 

ability to study.

So, I smiled. I chalked up 

our exchange to “politics” and 
went to bed.

And as I lay there, feeling 

assailed, I realized I no longer 
feel safe in my home.

I don’t know if I will heal.
All I know is that I might 

need a new place to stay.

In 1966, sociologist William 

Petersen coined the term “model 
minority.” Model minorities are 
minorities who had supposedly 
overcome 
discrimination 

through solid family structure 
and values of hard work.

Ingredients 
list: 
one 
new 

3-year 
old 
immigrant 
from 

South Korea

Prep time: 17 years
Cook time: four years
Servings: one

Preparation list:
1. Your child is in elementary 

school; though they are at 
the prime age to play and 
develop social skills, quickly 
enroll 
them 
in 
private 

education such as Kumon.

2. Put 
them 
in 
a 
foreign 

language 
club 
or 
school 

during 
the 
weekends, 

preferably in the mother 
tongue.

3. Make sure they play an 

instrument, 
preferably 

violin or clarinet so they are 
seen to be competitive and 
able to be in the spotlight to 
play the melody.

4. Don’t 
forget 
to 
enroll 

them in a sport. Asians are 
stereotypically the best at 
racquet sports and sports 
about 
hand-eye 
coordination. 

Recommendation is tennis.

5. Continue 
to 
put 
them 

through copious hours of 
tutoring. 

6. Take 
away 
video 
games 

and TV shows, as they are a 
waste of time that could be 
used for education.

7. Force them to take the Math 

Placement 
Exam 
and 
as 

many honors and AP courses 
as possible.

8. Stuff them into STEM field 

extracurriculars.

9. Make sure child is well-fed, 

but it’s not necessary to ask 
how they are doing.

10. Surround your child with 

adults who think they can 
control their life at whim, 
and never ask your child 
what they want.

11. Every moment should be 

used as a teaching lesson, 
including 
car 
rides 
and 

birthdays.

12. Make sure they are only 

involved in things that can 
improve résumés.

13. Use fear tactics to motivate 

your child, teaching them 
failure is never OK.

14. Buy them an entire classics 

book set or demand other 
lofty pursuits.

15. Career 
professions 
must 

be 
limited 
to: 
engineer, 

business and doctor.

Warning: Your recipe could 

go awry. Though it may look 
fine from the outside, there 
could be a sudden souring flavor 
as your recipe may undergo 
crippling depression or constant 
anxiety and panic attacks. No 
need to worry, just continue to 
go through the recipe and hope 
things get better.

Notes: Make sure to ask other 

parents what they do with their 
children to make sure your 
recipe will not finish “last.”

“If you judge a fish by its 

ability to climb a tree, it will 
live its whole life believing it 
is stupid” -Albert Einstein. For 
many East Asian parents, the 
ultimate measure of the success 
of their offspring is based on 
the mere names of prestigious 
institutions and Fortune 500 
companies, worshipping them 
as idols and as points to brag 
about to their social circles. 
Through 
this 
belief, 
many 

Asian-American students are 
pigeonholed into paths that 
are supposed to lead to these 
outcomes.

Granted, 
there 
are 
those 

who do make it down this path 
and become doctors, bankers 
and engineers. You often hear 
of these stories on the news; 
reflected as “model minorities,” 
Asian Americans are held as 
the gold standard for the rest 
of the country for our work 
ethic and prized as evidence 
that the American dream is still 
vibrant and possible. However, 
what is less often presented 
are the statistics on mental 
health for Asian Americans. 
Two-point-two million Asian 
Americans have been diagnosed 
with mental illnesses, and 18.9 
percent 
of 
Asian-American 

high 
school 
students 
have 

reported considering suicide. 
Consider also that not all Asian 
Americans come from the same 
background. Not every Asian 
American came over as an 
immigrant working in the tech 
industry, and there are those 
who face financial hardship, 
with a wealth gap of the richest 
Asian Americans wealth being 
168 times the amount of the 
poorest ones. 

I am not saying there is 

something intrinsically wrong 
with jobs such as doctors or 
bankers, but when it becomes 
a one-size-fits-all, there are 
consequences. When excellence 
becomes defined in limited and 
damaging ways, it removes the 
human aspect of it all. The fact 
is that humans inherently are 
all born with different gifts 
and talents, especially when 
these jobs are selected for the 
sole reason that they have high 
salaries. 
In 
addition, 
Asian 

Americans do not realize that 
the very spots at Harvard we 
strive for have already been 
given 
away 
to 
donors 
and 

wealthy white folks who have 
legacies at the school — or when 
admissions officers say they are 
moving toward more holistic 
approaches, 
valuing 
sports 

higher than musical ability in 
priority in admissions because 
too many Asians are good at 
music.

I

’m 
an 
evolutionary 

anthropology major, and, 
if asked for a detailed 

definition of what exactly that 
means, 
I 
wouldn’t 

be able to give a 
comprehensive 
answer. 
My 

apologies 
for 
not 

yet 
memorizing 

my 
degree-tailored 

elevator 
pitch 
for 

future employers — 
that’s a problem for 
another 
day. 
The 

truth is, I had a lot of 
biology credits after 
my freshman year of college but 
didn’t feel like taking physics to 
fulfill the prerequisites for any 
of the University of Michigan’s 
more standard science majors. 
So, I scanned LSA’s website until 
I finally found it, a major that 
incorporated my hard-earned 
science credits without asking 
me to think in watts or joules.

This is often the way that 

undergraduates 
end 
up 
in 

the more obscure corners of 
academia. 
Sometimes, 
these 

decisions are originally made 
out of credit-based convenience, 
with that convenience leading 
(hopefully) thereafter to a love 
or enjoyment for the chosen area 
of study.

The fact that these niche 

fields are available to college 
students is absolutely a good 
thing — it really is. It’s proof that 
the college environment, major-
permitting, can be conducive to 
academic experimentation and 
self-discovery. However, with 
the specificity of these singular 
academic niches seeming, at 
times, 
slightly 
disconnected 

from reality, what is truly gained 
from channeling time and energy 
into these fields over other 
subjects with a broader and more 
intersectional academic scope?

Upper-level 
courses 
in 

the 
biological 
anthropology 

department are facilitated by 
highly experienced professors 
with 
strong 
histories 
in 

hands-on conservation work. 
These 
impressive 
individuals 

have 
doctorate 
degrees 
and 

research histories in various 
conservation 
hotspots 
such 

as Indonesia, Kenya and New 
Zealand. 
These 
places 
have 

noticeably 
and 
detrimentally 

experienced the direct effects 
of Western industrialism and 
require conservation action to 

preserve a globally 
unparalleled amount 
of biodiversity.

And here, between 

the white walls of an 
Ann Arbor classroom, 
my fellow classmates 
and I are informed 
that the conservation 
need 
is 
desperate 

domestically 
— 

but 
perhaps 
to 
a 

much 
different 

degree than the international 
need 
for 
conservation. 
As 

centers 
for 
ecotourism 
and 

foreign 
consumerism, 
these 

prime locations for biological 
anthropology 
research 
face 

environmental 
threats 
such 

as the logging and subsequent 
forest degradation often inflicted 
upon areas with features such as 
tropical rainforests.

Basically, our discussions 

are grounded in specialized 
knowledge and facilitated by 
perhaps the only person in the 
classroom with the precise 
travel and research experience 
to really understand the topic 
on a broader, more practice-
oriented scale.

The 
terminology, 
the 

statistics — they’re all indicative 
of the scientific method at 
work. There’s no doubt about 
that. Yet, this subject is much 
more theoretical than, say, 
biochemistry, genetics and the 
like. It’s a large-scale practice 
of an emerging field, the pursuit 
of constructing a human past 
unknown 
and 
reconciling 

present-day environmental issues 
that remain unresolved. What 
then is theory unaccompanied by 
its actual practice?

And that’s just the thing: As 

much as we undergraduate folks 
who’ve made our way into these 
corners of niche academia would 
like to put learned theory to 
practice, we’ve already limited 
ourselves to an extent. With the 
extreme specificity of these fields 
comes a hierarchical academic 
constraint 
on 
options 
for 

upward mobility in jobs directly 
applicable to our majors. That is 
to say, academia is truthfully one 

of the few professional places 
that 
provides 
jobs 
aligning 

exactly 
with 
such 
specific 

undergraduate 
degrees. 
As 

common knowledge would tell, 
jobs in academia come only after 
a master’s or Ph.D., necessary 
tools of higher education needed 
to whittle a vested “interest” or 
“passion” down to its bare bones.

In 
limiting 
ourselves 
to 

rather niche fields to which 
we’ve had only limited exposure 
over just a couple of years of 
undergraduate study, we’re also 
limiting our academic scope. 
We then cast ourselves into 
unusually specific categories 
of self-identification. Students 
often adhere to majors as self-
assessments of individuality, 
and they’re not wrong in doing 
so — academics make up such a 
vast component of college life 
that it seems nearly impossible 
not 
to 
identify, 
in 
some 

capacity, with a prospective 
degree or career path.

Maybe the biggest danger 

of all would be to fall passively 
into one of these niches, limiting 
intersectional visibility between 
subjects and sacrificing holistic 
knowledge 
for 
specialized 

expertise.

This is not to say that these 

fields aren’t just as important or 
interesting as pre-professional 
ones that leave the specialization 
for after undergrad. It’s also not 
an advisory against these areas of 
undergraduate study. Rather, it’s 
a meditation on how to possibly 
navigate 
the 
intersectional 

nature of academic subjects in 
a market pushing increasingly 
for that pinnacle of expertise, 
that smaller range of knowledge 
with somehow profound and 
valuable depth.

So, as much as I love to theorize 

about the possible language of 
Neanderthals, I’m aware that 
this knowledge is only applicable 
in a very narrow sphere. While 
I’ll continue with the pursuit of 
my evolutionary anthropology 
degree, I must remember to 
retain a wider academic scope 
in order to prevent falling into 
a sort of passive tunnel vision 
within this specialized field.

O

n 
Oct. 
4, 
reports 

emerged of an alleged 
ambush on U.S. troops 

in Niger by ISIS forces occupying 
neighboring territory. 

While the first few reports by 

news outlets like CNN focused 
on the lack of information 
and clarity surrounding the 
circumstances 
that 
led 
to 

this attack, specifically why a 
group of 12 U.S. Green Berets 
would be left without backup 
in the middle of Niger, the 
narrative shifted to President 
Donald Trump’s response over 
the following weeks.

Initially, U.S. Africa Command 

released a statement revealing 
that three U.S. troops had been 
killed in the ambush and that one 
member of the Green Beret team 
was still unaccounted for. The 
missing soldier, whose identity 
was not released until almost 48 
hours after the attack, turned out 
to be Sgt. La David Johnson from 
Florida.

The secrecy surrounding the 

mission in Niger and Trump’s 
subsequent 
response 
to 
the 

death of Sgt. Johnson, publicized 
in a recent NBC interview with 
his widow, Myeshia Johnson, 
reveals a gaping hole in the 
president’s character.

In her account of Trump’s 

condolence call, which came 
almost two weeks after her 
husband’s 
death, 
Myeshia 

Johnson 
highlighted 
the 

president’s inability to show 
empathy for her situation and 
grief. Not only did she divulge 
that Trump’s tone “made [her] 
cry,” but she claimed that 
Trump 
stumbled 
over 
and 

nearly forgot Sgt. Johnson’s 
name — a statement that was 
backed. up by Rep. Frederica 
Wilson, 
D-Fla., 
who 
was 

present during the call.

More than any of Trump’s 

policy decisions that might 
garner 
criticism 
from 
a 

political lens, like building a 
wall on the U.S.-Mexico border 
or destroying Obamacare, his 

inability to show compassion, 
empathy and integrity in times 
of crisis is a far worse prospect 
for the future of this country.

While Trump’s striking lack 

of compassion for Myeshia 
Johnson and her family shook 
the nation, unfortunately it 
should not come as a surprise 
given his actions so far during 
his time in office.

In a previous article, “What 

entertainers got right,” I detailed 
the slow speed and lack of hands-
on 
intervention 
with 
which 

Trump 
acted 
on 
Hurricane 

Harvey relief efforts in Houston, 
Texas. Though far from the 
domestic sphere, the ambush 
in Niger marked the deadliest 
U.S. military conflict of Trump’s 
presidency and instilled in many 
a sense of fear and confusion. Yet 
in the wake of these situations, 
Trump’s response was hesitant, 
distant 
and 
impersonal, 

highlighting what some would 
call an utter lack of humanity.

Even worse than Trump’s 

emotionless 
responses 
in 

situations like these, however, 
is his use of deceit to cover up 
his actions.

Immediately after Johnson’s 

interview 
with 
NBC 
made 

national news, Trump rebuked 
her claim that his tone and 
rhetoric during the call were 
inappropriate. Regardless of 
the validity of her account of 
the phone call, no one should 
challenge 
the 
feelings 
and 

judgments of a grieving widow, 
much less the president of the 
United States.

Trump’s gut instinct — to 

lie and project his flaws onto 
others instead of accepting 
responsibility for his actions 
— is by no means an acceptable 
quality 
for 
the 
country’s 

supposed role model.

When pressed about his 

condolence call by the media, 
Trump attempted to glorify his 
efforts by claiming that past 
presidents, including Barack 
Obama, had not called the 

families of slain servicemen in 
the past. Unsurprisingly, this 
statement proved to be false.

How did Trump deal with 

criticism from the press following 
his untrue claim about Obama? By 
blaming someone else, of course, 
saying, “I was told he didn’t (call 
the families of soldiers) often.” 

All of this is to say that 

though 
Trump’s 
policy 

decisions may warrant negative 
attention, his inability to show 
a basic a level of human decency 
and compassion during times 
of despair is a critical flaw 
Democrats and Republicans 
should acknowledge.

And while it might seem like 

Trump’s character flaws are 
far removed from the lives of 
college students like myself, his 
rhetoric conveys a dangerous 
message about the power of 
scapegoating, which has the 
ability to influence hate-fueled 
behavior across the country.

By normalizing the use of 

deceit and scapegoating as a 
defense 
mechanism, 
Trump 

could 
very 
well 
indirectly 

encourage the efforts of hate 
groups on college campuses that 
see the use of lies and propaganda 
as an excuse for their actions. For 
example, in September, racist 
language was placed on doors in 
West Quad Residence Hall in an 
act the Black Student Union said 
was a deliberate hate crime.

It would not be fair to say 

that 
Trump’s 
administration 

has condoned actions like this, 
as the president has publicly 
condemned racist incidents that 
have occurred so far this year. 

However, 
if 
Trump 

consistently fails to show the 
qualities of respect and integrity 
necessary for any president, it 
may open what hate groups see 
as a window of opportunity — a 
far more dangerous prospect 
than 
any 
policy 
concerns 

expressed by the public.

 Among the many worries 
students 
face 
upon 
their 

arrival to campus, none hits 
harder than the race to find 
housing 
before 
all 
future 

leases are sucked away. City 
ordinances require Ann Arbor 
landlords to honor a 70-day 
grace period at the start of the 
lease period, during which 
landlords are not allowed 
to show properties or give 
out 
housing 
contracts 
to 

prospective renters.

The lack of time pressures 

students 
into 
locking 

themselves into a lease that 
is out of budget, since there is 
often little time in a student’s 
schedule for rigorous price 
hunting. 
This 
“running 

race” for housing can be 
particularly unfair for low-
income students who don’t 
have the luxury to wait in long 
leasing office lines.

On 
top 
of 
economic 

considerations, housing has 
social 
implications. 
This 

issue is particularly salient 
for freshmen, who might not 
have a solid group of friends 
in the first few weeks of 
school. Freshmen often find 
themselves wondering if their 
budding 
relationships 
will 

last long enough to ensure a 
stress-free 
living 
situation 

with a group they aren’t quite 
sure will stay together.

These problems are due 

in part to the fact that many 
leasing 
companies 
and 

landlords neglect to follow 
the regulation in the first 
place. According to a 2015 

Michigan 
Daily 
interview 

with 
Ann 
Arbor 
property 

manager 
Jon 
Keller, 
the 

penalty fee for violating the 
70-day rule is negligible to 
landlords who generate larger 
profits and often is not even 
enforced. 
Many 
landlords 

further bypass this regulation 
through reservation systems. 
This 
makes 
an 
already-

competitive housing season 
even 
less 
forgiving, 
as 

properties are scooped up 
off the market before many 
students even consider their 
housing situation for the next 
year.

The 
city 
can 
begin 
to 

address this housing anxiety 
by legitimizing the 70-day 
rule. 
This 
would 
require 

upping the penalty fee to a 
price that has some teeth and 
enforcing it. If landlords can 
no longer ignore the costs 
incurred by violating the city 
code, students would be given 
space to breathe in those 70 
days. At the very least, the 
housing hunt would become 
a more even playing field for 
first-year students.

Ann Arbor’s new revenue 

from 
the 
increased 
fee 

could also be funneled into 
a subsidy program for low-
income students to better 
afford housing. With some 
clever political maneuvering 
and activism from students, 
the Editorial Board believes 
Ann Arbor City Council can 
agree on a fine that preserves 
the integrity of the law while 
ensuring businesses remain 

incentivized 
to 
provide 

housing services for the city.

For 
most 
students, 
the 

housing process is a negative, 
anxiety-provoking experience. 
There is almost a consensus 
that finding an apartment or 
house is expensive and risky, 
especially when only freshmen 
are 
guaranteed 
spots 
in 

University of Michigan housing. 
The Editorial Board believes 
the most effective way to bring 
about change is through the 
Ann Arbor city government. 
Students should direct their 
frustrations to elections, to 
town halls, to petitioning what 
vexes them. City Council needs 
to know this is a top priority 
for students, who make up a 
substantial 
portion 
of 
Ann 

Arbor’s population. With this 
knowledge, it can begin to work 
to lower leasing costs and create 
a more productive system.

The 
housing 
issue 
is 

complex, 
with 
fault 
on 

students and City Council 
alike. 
The 
lethargy 
seen 

among 
undergraduates 
is 

key to why nothing changes; 
however, City Council is to 
blame for deprioritizing an 
issue that affects a great 
percentage of Ann Arbor’s 
population. The best course 
of action is for students to 
step up and push City Council 
to consider the issue past the 
surface level. Building these 
relationships will be integral 
to 
instituting 
tangible 

change to make housing more 
affordable and less stressful 
to find.

FROM THE DAILY

Make housing less stressful
F

all term brings a familiar struggle back to students: the 
scramble to get a group of friends together, the hours scouring 
the internet or taking to the streets to find that perfect 

house or apartment, the scraping together of money for a security 
deposit. Then, once everything is in place, they arrive at the leasing 
office only to find out that house has already been reserved for the 
upcoming school year. They thought they were being proactive. 
After all, school just started a few weeks ago. This is not a new 
phenomenon — the housing search has been an immense source of 
stress for students for years. The Michigan Daily Editorial Board 
believes students and Ann Arbor City Council must work in tandem 
to improve housing policies to lessen stress for students.

Rick and his gang are back for 

an explosive season eight premiere, 
literally. Rick Grimes (Andrew 
Lincoln, “Robot Chicken”) once 
again manages to assemble a 
detailed, 
methodical 
plan 
to 

overthrow the newest, baddest 
villain introduced in season six: 
Negan 
(Jeffrey 

Dean 
Morgan, 

“The Good Wife”).

Disclaimer: 

I 
watched 

“The 
Walking 

Dead” from the 
beginning 
until 

about season five. 
I was hoping this 
season 
premiere 

would recapture 
my interest in the show. It turned 
out to be semi-successful.

Many 
members 
of 
Rick’s 

original entourage are still around, 
making the show feel familiar and 
steady. However, some of them 
have undergone some character 
changes, 
like 
Father 
Gabriel 

(Seth Gilliam, “Teen Wolf”). The 
previously goody-two-shoes pastor 
has shown his darker side — one 
suited up in armor, a machine 
gun and a willingness to kill he 
didn’t have before. He devolves, 
which reveals a terrifying truth: 
Even a pastor is capable of turning 
to murder. This example of 
character development is strangely 
refreshing, and it elevates the 
quality of the show, somehow 
making it relatable in a completely 
unrelatable world.

Another 
fascinating 
feature 

of the show is how it tends to 
cut to many different scenes, yet 
always seems to keep the storyline 
coherent. It will bounce from 
Rick, to his son Carl (Chandler 
Riggs, 
“Robot 
Chicken”), 
to 

Daryl’s (Norman Reedus, “Robot 
Chicken”) attacks on many of the 
Survivors. Instead of confusing the 
viewer, it keeps them on their toes 
and draws in their interest.

Although the main plotline is 

about 
Rick 

and his group’s 
vendetta 
against 
Negan’s group 
called 
the 

Survivors, 
there are many 
subplots 
that 

reveal 
heart, 

grit, sacrifice, 
vulnerability 

and loyalty. In a world gone to 
hell, the writers still give these 
characters 
complex, 
intricate 

values that can’t be discerned into 
simply good or evil. Gabriel saves 
the head of the Hilltop Colony, 
even though the man essentially 
threatened to kill him. Carl delivers 
canned food to a stranger that 
could be a potential danger. Negan 
has the chance to surrender but 
doesn’t out of pride.

To all the viewers out there, 

can we just talk about this tiger? 
King 
Ezekiel 
(Khary 
Payton, 

“Teen Titans Go”) has a pet tiger, 
Shiva. I’m so confused as to how. 
What does she eat? How does she 
behave? Where did he even get her? 
How has she not eaten the entire 
cast yet? For a multidimensional 
show, there are some stretches that 
are just too extraneous.

Throughout the episode, many 

scenes are a close up of Rick’s face. 
His eyes are bright blue, contrasted 
against his red, puffy eyelids. His 
face is drenched in sweat, and 
he appears to be looking off into 
something far in the distance. The 
director randomly cuts to this 
scene many times. Although the 
scene itself appears random, Rick’s 
face shows raw emotion and pain, 
which grants Lincoln an “A” in my 
book. This scene is used as a break 
between all of the high intensity 
drama and offers the viewer an 
insight to Rick’s true feelings — 
ones of fear and agony.

In almost every scene, there 

is almost always a hint of music 
playing 
in 
the 
background. 

Whether it’s strong or mild, it 
tends to keep the dialogue even 
more dramatic or serious without 
overdoing it. The light piano riffs 
always succeed in creating a sense 
of nervousness whenever there is a 
walker around: is this person going 
to die right now?

The biggest problem with this 

episode was the ending — there 
was absolutely no cliffhanger. For 
a show famous for its unnerving, 
jaw 
dropping, 
goosebump-

worthy endings, it simply didn’t 
deliver. Instead, it ended in with 
an unrealistic, utopian dream of 
Rick’s that gave viewers a warm 
and fuzzy feeling, too foreign for 
this show.

I may have taken a break from 

“The Walking Dead” but overall, 
the season premiere proved why 
this show is back for its eighth 
season. The drama, horror and 
character 
developments 
work 

together to generate a cohesive 
theme.

“The Walking 

Dead”

Season 8 premiere

AMC

Sundays at 9 p.m.

In 
2015, 
singer-songwriter 

Julien Baker released Sprained 
Ankle. Filled with a hushed 
tenderness, her first studio album 
tiptoed in shadows. Yet, despite the 
uniformity of its muted restraint, 
the album was distinct in its humble 
reverence. The quavering delicacy 
of Baker’s voice stripped songs like 
“Vessels” and “Everybody Does” 
to 
their 
bare 

bones. 
Rattling 

skeletons 
in 

the closet, the 
haunting 
of 

Sprained Ankle 
left a lingering 
impact. 

Now, 
nearly 

two 
years 
later, 
Baker 
has 

released Turn Out the Lights. 
The LP fills in the shaky outline 
of Sprained Ankle with weighty 
piano and unflinching vocals; the 
masterpiece that is left behind 
blooms in full color. In Turn 
Out The Lights, Baker professes 
secrets, revelations about anything 
from past failed relationships to 
God, with an ache that bruises.

The 
beginning 
of 
the 

album’s opening track, “Over,” 
is surprising. Instead of the 
traditional quiet hum of Baker’s 
guitar, an audio narrative unfolds: 
a door creaks open to welcome 
shuffling footsteps that rattle 

unseen floorboards; the intimate 
clatter of someone entering an 
empty room builds a sense of 
privacy. As listeners, we are the 
guests in her home, allowed to 
trespass on her solitude, voyeurs to 
her introspective melancholy. 

The 
chronicle 
in 
“Over” 

continues: 
a 
piano 
boldly 

commences, followed by the sigh 
of backing instrumentals. No 
vocals breach the crescendoing 
climb of orchestral harmonies that 
eventually tapers out and smoothly 

transitions 
into 

the first verse of 
“Appointments.” 
Baker’s murmured 
“I’m 
staying 
in 

tonight / I won’t 
stop 
you 
from 

leaving / I know 
that I’m not what 

you wanted / Am I?” is a gossamer 
layer over subdued background 
harmonies.

Without warning there is an 

exoneration; within the last few 
minutes of the song, Baker delivers 
the chorus in a half-yell. The once 
nearly indistinguishable piano is 
now an uproar of crashing chords.

“Turn Out the Lights” follows 

a similar pattern. The first few 
verses are like sheer curtains that 
dance on the edge of subconscious, 
a soft lull that breaks when Baker 
does. The cathartic howl of “When 
I turn out the lights / there’s no 
one left / between myself and me” 
reveals the tension and turmoil 

lying hidden beneath Baker’s 
initial measured composure.

Julien Baker is defiant in a way 

that was rarely seen on Sprained 
Ankle. Her emotive declarations 
are unapologetic. The profession 
of “the harder I swim, the faster I 
sink” in “Sour Breath” rasps with a 
grating desperation. The question 
of “then why, then why, then why 
/ then why not me?” in “Happy to 
Be Here” is a frustrated appeal that 
intensifies with every repetition.

There is a focus on her struggle 

with mental health: a loss of 
purpose and a resulting slip into 
substance abuse. Songs like “Sour 
Breath” and “Everything That 
Helps You Sleep” reveal Baker’s 
own past experiences, bluntly 
detailing toxic relationships and 
insomnia wrapped up in layers 
of religious iconography — an 
interpersonal struggle between her 
Christian faith and the things she 
has done that she views as sinful. 
There is no holding back on Turn 
Out the Lights. The unrelenting 
anguish is hard not to drown in, 
but it’s a surprisingly easy album 
to listen to from beginning to end.

Throughout 
it 
all, 
the 

consistency of the underlying 
piano and overarching motifs — 
stitched together by Baker’s voice 
as it fluctuates between soothing 
and 
heartbreaking 
— 
creates 

an effortless progression; every 
song feeds into the next. It’s the 
ceaseless wave of Julien Baker’s 
most private confessions.

Turn Out The 

Lights

Julien Baker

Matador

The term “We were eight years 

in power” signifies immediate 
connotations. 
Historically, 

it refers to the eight years of 
Reconstruction 
that 
occurred 

before white supremacy firmly 
reasserted itself in the South. In his 
new book, “We Were Eight Years 
in Power: An American Tragedy,” 
Ta-Nehisi Coates adapts it as a way 
of examining the eight years of 
Barack Obama’s presidency.

The framework within which 

“We Were Eight Years in Power” 
operates is a series of eight essays in 
chronological order, all originally 
published in The Atlantic, tracing 
recent American history through 
Obama’s 
initial 
campaign 
to 

the ultimate election of Donald 
Trump. The question one starts the 
book with is, How did we get here? 
What led to Trump’s presidency? 
The sense is that the 2016 election 
will be the ultimate “climax” of the 
book, so to speak, that Trump’s 
victory is the “American tragedy” 
to which the title is referring.

This both is and isn’t true. All 

in all, the focus of the book is 
surprisingly independent of the 
topic of Trump. For the majority 
of it, the 2016 election comes into 
play only tangentially. The true 
“American tragedy” that takes 
shape over the course of the book 

doesn’t take the form of one man; 
rather, one gets the sense that it is 
really our country’s whole history 
that has been, and continues to be, 
the tragedy.

A big part of this is due to the 

historical depth and extraordinary 
span of the book. The focus of 
many parts reaches back to the 
Civil War and even beyond, to the 
founding of this country itself. His 
analysis of various aspects of race 
bring in well-known figures like 
Abraham Lincoln and Frederick 
Douglass, but also — equally 
often, if not more so — names that 
might be less commonplace in 
households and history books, like 
Margaret Garner and Ida B. Wells. 
Every single subject he comes 
across, Coates treats with dignity, 
respect and complexity. The book’s 
approach seems to be that there is 
no story not worth telling.

The result is a book that 

feels rich, natural and wholly 
comprehensive. Every article is 
extremely well researched, and 
yet Coates’s eloquence leaves 
the reader with the impression 
that he knew it all to begin with. 
These facts and stories were just 
at his fingertips, and because we 
are reading his work, they are at 
ours. He effectively makes things 
as easy as he can for the reader, at 
least in terms of comprehension.

This is particularly impressive 

because the subject matter itself 
is in no way easy. In “We Were 

Eight Years in Power,” Coates 
establishes a pattern of explaining 
an argument as fully and fairly 
as 
possible, 
then 
challenging 

it at every turn in order to see 
whether or not it holds up to 
scrutiny. He does this through a 
wide array of lenses and topics, 
including the black conservatism 
of Bill Cosby, the American-ness 
of Michelle Obama, the firing of 
Shirley Sherrod, the Civil War, the 
Contract Buyers League, hip hop, 
the murder of Trayvon Martin 
and so much more. The web that 
Coates spends the book spinning is 
not only historically far-reaching; 
it also digs deep into the fabric of 
American culture, entertainment 
and class.

Some of the essays are already 

more well-known than others — 
“The Case for Reparations,” for 
instance, and “Fear of a Black 
President.” But even these are 
well worth revisiting within the 
context that Coates sets up in the 
book. When all of these essays 
are combined with Coates’s added 
notes, they form a complete, and 
profoundly 
articulated, 
image 

of Obama’s presidency and the 
layered context surrounding it. 
“We Were Eight Years in Power” 
is essential reading for anyone 
seeking 
to 
better 
understand 

the integral place of race within 
America, from one of the most 
eloquent masters of essay-form 
writing today.

Laith al-Saadi performing 
at the Michigan Theater 

Finalist on NBC’s “The Voice,” 

Ann Arbor native and University 
of Michigan alum Laith Al-Saadi 
returns to his home-town for one 
rockin’ concert at the Michigan 
Theater.

Armed 
with 

a 
degree 
from 

the University of 
Michigan in jazz 
guitar 
and 
bass, 

and an incredible 
voice 
and 
vocal 

growl, 
Al-Saadi 

is 
a 
powerhouse 

of a vocalist and a 
certified master of the guitar.

“We’re gonna have a blast over 

the evening,” Al-Saadi said in an 
interview with The Daily. The 
concert will feature special guest 
performers made up of Al-Saadi’s 
long-time friends: Ann Arbor blues 
favorite Al Hill and the funky 
METERS’s Brian Stoltz. On top of 
that, the audience should be ready 
for “tributes and surprises.”

Throughout his career, Al-Saadi 

has shared the stage with many 
big names like Taj Mahal, Luther 
Alison, Buddy Guy, Son Seals, Gregg 

Allman and B.B. King. In addition to 
that, major retailer and influential 
voice in the guitar community, 
Guitar Center, named Al-Saadi “one 
of the top four blues guitarists in the 
United States.”

More than just being an iconic 

Ann Arbor venue, the Michigan 
Theater holds sentimental value for 
Al-Saadi.

“I grew up 

in Ann Arbor, 
and 
my 
first 

professional 
theatre 
gigs 

when I was a 
kid were there.” 
He performed in 
many shows at 
the theater and 

even “graduated from high school 
on (its) stage.” When Al-Saadi 
returned from “The Voice,” the 
Michigan Theater was the venue 
for 
his 
homecoming 
concert. 

This will be Al-Saadi’s second 
time performing at the Michigan 
Theater since returning last year.

Before his time on the show, 

Al-Saadi performed 300 nights 
annually in Ann Arbor over the 
course of 20 years, prompting The 
Ann Arbor News to name him 
“the hardest working man in Ann 
Arbor showbusiness.” It was his 

constant dedication and talent that 
captured the attention of “The 
Voice” producers, who gave him a 
VIP audition for the show.

Al-Saadi started off strong with 

his blind audition, performing “The 
Letter” by Joe Cocker. As of October 
31st, 2017 the video has been viewed 
almost 6 million times on YouTube.

He’s proud to have stayed true 

to his style and character while 
on the show, performing classics 
like “With a Little Help from my 
Friends,” “The Thrill is Gone” and 
“All Along the Watchtower.”

Now that he’s no longer on 

the show, this means his fanbase 
expects to hear the songs that he 
loves to perform. 

According 
to 
Al-Saadi, 
his 

time on “The Voice,” “couldn’t 
have turned out better,” because 
it helped him gain national and 
international exposure by making it 
all the way to the final round, while 
avoiding being tied to a contract 
that would’ve come from placing 
first. This gave him the freedom 
to perform where and what he 
wanted. 

Now, Al-Saadi is excited to be 

returning to the Michigan Theater 
to celebrate his 40th Birthday Bash 
where he and the audience are 
“gonna jam out all night.”

Defense “getting back to business”

There’s a lot to admire about this 

Michigan defense. Just ask Pep 
Hamilton. 

After all, as Michigan’s passing 

game coordinator, there are few out 
there who see the unit as much as he 
does.

“I find myself, at times, just taking 

a break from trying to sort out what 
we’re gonna do on the next series,” 
Hamilton said, “and just watching 
how intense and how physical Don 
Brown’s defense is playing.”

Seven times this year, the unit has 

warranted Hamilton’s admiration. 
The one exception came 12 days 
ago, when then-No. 2 Penn State 
hung 42 points and 506 yards on the 
Wolverines.

For sophomore defensive end 

Rashan Gary, it was a bad feeling. 
Last Tuesday, he voiced that the 
blowout was something worth 
going through, something that 
could ultimately make this defense 
better. But he admitted it hurt 
nonetheless, and that a matchup 
with Rutgers was a chance to get the 
bad taste out of his mouth.

Michigan seized that opportunity, 

holding the Scarlet Knights to 
195 yards, notching five sacks and 
recording 11 tackles for loss. It was, 
as defensive coordinator Don Brown 
called it, “getting back to business.”

“I’m just gonna say this: The last 

two weeks in practice have been 
unbelievably good. Period,” Brown 
said. “I come off yesterday’s practice, 
(and) we can’t go much harder. If we 
go much harder, somebody’s gonna 
get hurt. And that would be dumb, 
that’s on me.

“It’s kind of a sense of urgency. 

I don’t think we were fat-catting it 
(before Penn State) by any stretch 
of the imagination, but it certainly 

refocuses your energy and your 
enthusiasm and your passion to get 
the thing right.”

Against Rutgers, most things 

did go right. But there were still 
mistakes.

With just under 11 minutes 

remaining in the third quarter, 
the Scarlet Knights were facing 
3rd-and-15 from their own 20-yard 
line.

Rutgers quarterback Giovanni 

Rescigno called for the snap, and 
subsequently whipped a 30-yard 
completion to tight end Jerome 
Washington. It was well covered 
by Noah Furbush, but the senior 
linebacker couldn’t manage to turn 
his head around and break up the 
pass.

Just four plays later, there was 

another setback.

Rescigno lined up on 1st-and-10 

from 
Michigan’s 
38-yard 
line, 

floating a pass to Hunter Hayek on 
the left sideline. Junior safety Tyree 
Kinnel tracked the Rutgers wide 
receiver the entire way, but Hayek 
still made a highlight reel play, 
pulling off a one-handed catch for a 
21-yard gain.

On plays like that, Brown said 

he can only credit the opposing 
quarterback. And those plays aren’t 
cause to dismiss his aggressive, 
man-coverage scheme.

As Brown put it himself, zone 

coverage is “just not what we do.”

He did qualify that by saying 

that Michigan will, at most, line 
up in combination zone coverage 
— something the Wolverines did 
frequently 
against 
the 
Scarlet 

Knights.

But he has no interest in allowing 

receivers to run free through a zone. 
Instead, he stressed that he would 
rather teach fundamentals, allow 
defensive backs coach Brian Smith 
and secondary coach Mike Zordich 

to train the Wolverines’ secondary 
and implement other coverage 
concepts when appropriate.

One play, however, did warrant 

Brown’s 
attention. 
It 
just 
so 

happened to result in one of Rutgers’ 
two touchdowns.

With just under 11 minutes left 

in the second quarter, wide receiver 
Janarion Grant took the direct snap 
from the Scarlet Knights’ own 35. 
He faked the handoff and picked 
up a block on the left side of the line 
before cutting back to the middle. 
From there, he beat every Michigan 
defender in a foot race to the end 
zone.

“The one play that just irks the 

hell out of me was the run play,” 
Brown said. “That’s simple. … Guard 
pull, wide pull, one of our guys 
misses the pull. So obviously that’s 
on me. It’s not on him — didn’t run 
it enough or something. So you’ve 
gotta make sure you get on the pull.

“But still, (we) have a middle 

third defender coming down. We 
still have a back side that I don’t 
think was flying to the rock. We’ve 
got to fix that, and that’s what we 
talked about, is if you eliminate that 
run play right there and one other 
play, I mean come on, come on, 
that’s pretty good defense.”

Brown isn’t wrong. But the direct 

snap was a large reason why the 
Wolverines were thrashed in State 
College. It came back to bite them 
only a week later. And they will 
surely see that play in the coming 
weeks.

But Michigan’s defensive unit 

took that loss personally. If that 
is any indication, they will take 
Grant’s touchdown personally, too. 
Just ask Gary.

“If people think that we need to 

prove things to them,” he said last 
Tuesday, “they need to watch this 
game and every game after that.”

MATT VAILLIENCOURT/Daily

Michigan defensive coordinator Don Brown has watched his team play with more intensity and physicality in practice.

Under McCaffrey, scout team 
pushes ‘M’ defense forward

There is a long list of Wolverines 

who have built the Michigan 
football team’s defense into the 
fourth-ranked unit in the nation. 

But when defensive coordinator 

Don Brown was asked Wednesday 
about the state of his unit, he sang 
the praises of a Wolverine that might 
catch people by surprise. That’s 
because he doesn’t play defense.

“When we’re going in practice, 

not only are we good on defense,” 
he said, “Our scout team, without 
question, with Dylan McCaffrey at 
the helm, they go now.”

The true freshman quarterback 

may not have taken the field in 
a Michigan uniform yet, but he 
wasted no time making his impact 
on the team.

According to Brown, the past 

two weeks of practice have reached 
a new peak of intensity, as the 
Wolverines have taken it upon 
themselves to continue to improve 
on a daily basis. Even though 
Michigan has two losses on the 
season, Brown claimed that the 
expectations for the team haven’t 
been reduced.

But in order for the defense to 

push itself to compete at a high 
level, the scout team has to prepare 
for the particular offense of the 
upcoming opponent. That is where 
McCaffrey has proven to be most 
valuable.

“This is a special guy now,” 

Brown 
said. 
“... 
From 
our 

standpoint — to get ready — it’s nice 
when you have a scout team that is 
committed to the defense.

“…These guys take it seriously, 

and they help us get ready to play 
on Saturdays. And he spearheads 
it.”

Brown noted that he sees 

the young quarterback inside 
Schembechler Hall “all the time”, 
eager to bury his head into the 
playbook of the next team the 
Wolverines will face.

Leading up to their game against 

Minnesota, that preparation has 
shown up on the practice field.

“There’s a couple plays yesterday 

where he has to re-center the tight 
end, re-center the back and then run 
this specific scheme,” Brown said. “I 
swear it was the quarterback from 
Minnesota doing it ‘cause he did it 
exactly the same way.

“Our guys got him watching a 

little tape there, but then to come 
out and actually do it the same way. 
… It just gives you a chance.”

Instead of simply going through 

the motions and lamenting their 
standing on the scout team, those 
Wolverines 
have 
bought 
into 

the importance of their role in 
Michigan’s success. Taking the reins 
as the leader of that unit, McCaffrey 
has helped them do just that.

“When a guy takes it upon 

himself like that, he takes the whole 
group with him,” Brown said. 
“That gives us a chance to have 
a quality practice. And you don’t 
realize how important that is until, 
at the end of practice, you go, ‘Wow, 
that was really a good practice. We 
got a lot of work done.’”

Brown isn’t the only coach who 

has noticed McCaffrey’s influence 
on the scout team. Passing game 
coordinator Pep Hamilton noted 
how well McCaffrey has been able 
to handle the challenge of facing 
off against one of the best defensive 
units in the country.

“He has really good football 

instincts as far as having an 
understanding of what the defense 
is trying to do to him,” he said. 
“And with (Brown’s) defense, it’s 
real simple: they’re trying to hit the 
quarterback. … But he’s responded 
well in the situations that we’ve put 
him in.”

On a unit where it would be 

easy for him to fly under the radar, 
McCaffrey has stood out instead. 
Despite entering as the No. 6 
quarterback in the nation, the true 
freshman knew he wouldn’t have 
the opportunity to play on Saturdays 
in his first fall in Ann Arbor.

He has done the next best thing: 

prepare his teammates to play.

“It’s next door to what you want 

on a Saturday,” Brown said. “So in 
terms of giving us a chance from a 
preparation standpoint, all those 
things are in place.”

Michigan set to host Ferris State

Last October, the Michigan 

hockey team traveled to Big 
Rapids, Mich. for its first road test 
of the season against Ferris State. 
The Wolverines were outshot 
29-16, and only took the lead for 
good with four minutes to play, 
pulling out a 2-1 victory over the 
Bulldogs.

Of course, if it isn’t clear by now, 

this is a much different Michigan 
team, one coming off an impressive 
weekend split at No. 15 Penn State 
in which it scored nine goals. 
While last season the Wolverines 
were a young, inexperienced 
squad learning the nuances of 
the college game, Michigan (4-2 
overall) now possesses a balance 
of skilled underclassmen and 
veterans eager for redemption.

Against 
Ferris 
State 
(2-5-

1), the Wolverines will try to 
maximize this balance and hope 
it comes together at the same 
time. Michigan’s underclassmen 
carried them against Vermont two 
weeks ago, recording six of the 
Wolverines’ seven goals and seven 
of 10 assists. But in State College, 
it was the upperclassmen’s turn to 
take charge: Michigan was paced 

by the line of seniors Dexter Dancs 
and Tony Calderone and junior 
Cooper Marody, who combined 
for six goals and nine assists 
against the Nittany Lions.

“We’re gonna need the younger 

guys to chip in,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson. “They’ve 
chipped in a little bit, but we need 
a little bit more and we’re going to 
ask more of them.”

Whether it’s the underclassmen 

or the upperclassmen finding the 
net, a balanced attack has been one 
of the Wolverines’ strengths so far: 
Six of them have scored multiple 
goals throughout the season’s first 
six games, led by Calderone and 
Marody with three apiece.

Meanwhile, perhaps the biggest 

story of last weekend was how 
Michigan’s defense rebounded 
from a shaky performance Friday 
night, where it surrendered 54 
shots and five goals. On Saturday, 
sophomore goaltender Hayden 
Lavigne saved 42 of the 44 shots he 
faced, and the Wolverines turned 
in a tougher, more physical effort, 
blocking 29 shots on defense.

The goaltender battle, one of the 

biggest storylines for Michigan 
before the season, saw a turning 
point 
this 
weekend. 
Pearson 

originally had hoped to see either 

Lavigne 
or 
sophomore 
Jack 

LaFontaine 
assert 
themselves 

as Michigan’s No. 1 between the 
pipes by this point. But with the 
strong performance of both so 
far this season — LaFontaine and 
Lavigne rank second and third in 
the Big Ten in save percentage, 
respectively — that doesn’t appear 
likely to happen in the near future.

“We rotated them right from day 

one and it looks like that’s going to 
continue,” Pearson said Saturday. 
“I come from a school of being a 
one-goalie guy, but we have two 
good ones and the competition is 
good. They push each other and I 
hope it continues, because if they’re 
both playing that means they’re 
both playing well.”

Whether it’s LaFontaine or 

Lavigne, Ferris State will have its 
work cut out for it regardless. The 
Bulldogs average just 1.5 goals 
per game and have converted an 
NCAA-low five percent of their 
shots in eight games this season.

Forwards 
Corey 
Mackin 

and Mitch Maloney lead Ferris 
State with five and four points, 
respectively. But goaltender Darren 
Smith might be most important if 
the Bulldogs are to pull an upset. 
In four games this season, he has 
allowed an average of 2.2 goals and 
posted a .927 save percentage.

A needed area of improvement 

for the Wolverines is discipline. 
Michigan’s special teams units 
were particularly impressive this 
weekend, stopping all eight of the 
Nittany Lions’ power plays. But 
this performance, no matter how 
solid, wouldn’t have been needed if 
not for the 18 penalty minutes the 
Wolverines racked up Saturday, 
and they know they must stay on 
the ice to sustain their defensive 
momentum.

“We’ve got to do better,” Pearson 

said Saturday. “To be the least-
penalized team in the conference, 
that’s our goal. … Sometimes some 
things happen, but we’ve got to be 
more disciplined and understand 
how to manage that and manage 
how they’re calling the game.”

If Michigan is able to take the 

lessons it learned last weekend 
into this weekend’s contests and 
execute to its full potential, it will 
be tough for Ferris State to keep 
pace.
