Panelists at the University 

of Michigan met Tuesday 
afternoon to discuss Poverty 
Solutions 
— 
an 
initiative 

introduced 
by 
University 

President Mark Schlissel in 
October 2016 — and review 
nine research projects funded 
through a new grant program 
operated by the initiative. The 
projects, totaling $200,000, 
represent 
the 
initiative’s 

first investments in research 
and model testing aiming to 
use research about poverty 
to 
better 
suit 
different 

communities.

Poverty 
Solutions 

Director Luke Shaefer, an 
associate professor of social 
work 
and 
public 
policy, 

opened 
the 
discussion 

— 
held 
over 
Facebook 

Live — by introducing the 
interdisciplinary 
initiative, 

which, 
according 
to 
its 

mission 
statement, 
is 

designed “to become a leader 
in informing, identifying and 
testing new strategies for the 
prevention 
and 
alleviation 

of poverty in Michigan, the 
nation and the world.”

Poverty 
Solutions 

researches and works with 
policymakers and community 
organizations 
to 
better 

understand the causes and 

During 
Tuesday 
night’s 

meeting, 
Central 
Student 

Government set the dates for 
the election of the 2017-2018 
academic 
year’s 
leaders 
to 

be held on March 22 and 23, 
with 31 voting in favor and one 
abstaining.

As the current administration 

nears the end of its term, CSG 
President David Schafer, an LSA 
senior, praised the assembly for 
its hard work this past semester, 
encouraging the body to pursue 
its goals until the elections in 
March.

“Day in and day out we have 

fought for progressive policies 
and we will continue to fight for 
progressive policies until our 
last day,” Schafer said during 
last week’s meeting. “This is our 
promise to you … Change is best 
realized from the bottom up.”

Additionally, 
a 
resolution 

encouraging 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
to 
recognize 

Indigenous Peoples’ Day was 
unanimously 
passed. 
The 

resolution was introduced last 
week and aims to celebrate 
the holiday on the second 
Monday of October, formerly 
Columbus Day which is no 
longer 
recognized 
by 
the 

University. The Ann Arbor City 
Council 
voted 
unanimously 

in November 2015 to replace 
Columbus Day with Indigenous 
Peoples’ Day as well. 

The Ann Arbor City Council 

resolution 
was 
proposed 

by 
Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski (D–Ward 5), who 
made the movement on the 
notion that Columbus did not 
actually “discover” America.

“I think we all share a hope 

that this is more than just 
a changing on the name on 
the calendar, but it becomes 
an opportunity for a deeper 
community 
conversation 

about what’s happening with 

indigenous 
communities,” 

Warpehoski said in November. 
“It is a stereotype that Indians 
are only in history books 
for many people and one of 
my goals is that through the 
education effort that groups like 
the Native American Student 
Associations are doing they will 
get a chance to say yes, they’re 
still here.”

LSA junior Stephen Smith, 

Native 
American 
Student 

Association 
co-chair, 
said 

the University should follow 
holiday 
recognition 
trends 

throughout the country. Both 
Washtenaw County and the 
city of Ann Arbor already 
recognize Indigenous Peoples’ 
Day, and Smith noted that well-
established organizations do as 
well.

“There seems to be a growing 

trend across the nation of large 

With President-elect Donald 

Trump’s 
inauguration 
date 

days 
away, 
City 
Council’s 

meeting Tuesday night was 
dominated by the discussion of 
how to protect undocumented 
individuals, a topic usually 
reserved 
for 
a 
national 

scope. Larcom City Hall was 
packed with more than 100 
residents 
supporting 
the 

council’s resolution to urge 
President Barack Obama and 
state legislators to take steps 
protecting those who applied 
to the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals program.

DACA is an immigration 

policy 
put 
in 
place 
by 

Obama in 2012 that allows 
undocumented 
immigrant 

youth 
who 
meet 
certain 

criteria to receive a two-year 
deferral 
from 
deportation 

and a work permit. Trump, 
who ran on a platform against 
immigration and refugrees, has 
proposed policies which would 
threaten it. The President-
elect has previously referred

LANSING — The tone of 

Gov. Rick Snyder’s State of the 
State address was uplifting as 
he recognized the Michigan’s 
economic prosperity and pushed 
for accelerated improvements 

to infrastructure Tuesday night 
in Lansing. Though not all state 
legislators were pleased as many 
expressed 
disappointment 
in 

the governor for not devoting 
enough of the speech to the Flint 
water crisis. 

“We’ve made Michigan a place 

where if you work hard and play 
by the rules, you can truly get 

ahead,” Snyder said. “Not just 
survive, but thrive.”

Job growth was a focus of 

the speech, with Snyder stating 
since taking office in 2010, 
Michigan has created almost 
500,000 
private-sector 
jobs, 

while unemployment is down to 
a 15-year low of 4.9 percent.

Snyder 
recognized 

manufacturing and investment 
from the automotive industry as 
the chief job-creator in Michigan 
and said residents no longer have 
to leave the state to find quality 
jobs.

“We’ve created over 116,000 

manufacturing jobs since 2010; 
we lead the nation,” Snyder

Last week, University of 

Michigan alum Midori Maeda was 

announced as one of ten runners-

up from a pool of more than 7,000 

applicants in PepsiCo and 21st 

Century Fox’s “The Search for 

Hidden Figures” contest, which 

aims to recognize talented female 

researchers for their work in the 

STEM fields.

Maeda received a master’s 

degree in macromolecular science 

and engineering from the University 

in December 2016. She wrote in an 

email interview that she is currently 

working in an Ann Arbor research 

lab with Biomedical Engineering 

Prof. Shuichi Takayama, as well as at 

a startup, where she creates artificial 

biomaterials to understand how to 

cure different diseases.

“I was very lucky to join Dr. 

Shuichi Takayama’s research group,” 

Maeda wrote. “Here, I currently 

work on making artificial versions 

of biomaterials, such as neutrophil 

extracellular traps, to better 

understand their role in diseases and 

how to cure them. I am also working 

in a startup in Ann Arbor, called 

PHASIQ, developing new diagnostic 

tools.”

The contest was inspired 

by the recently released movie 

“Hidden Figures,” which depicts 

the careers of African-American 

female mathematicians Katherine 

Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and 

Mary Jackson. The women worked 

behind the scenes at NASA to provide 

computations to launch astronaut 

John Glenn into space as a part of the 

space race — a term describing the 

United States’s rivalry with the Soviet 

Union to get a man on the moon.

“We are honored to have the 

opportunity to share the story of 

Katherine Johnson and her peers 

whose contributions have remained 

hidden for too long,” Lachlan 

Murdoch, executive chairman of 

21st Century Fox, said in a press 

release. “At 21CF, we believe in the 

power of storytelling to inspire the 

next generation of talent to dream 

bigger and unlock their full potential, 

and through The Search for Hidden 

Figures contest we are excited to give 

young women across the country 

the encouragement to pursue those 

dreams.”

“Hidden Figures” has outgrossed 

all other box office films since its Jan. 

6 release and received praise from 

numerous critics for revealing the 

untold stories of Johnson, Vaughan 

and Jackson.

As a runner-up, Maeda will 

receive a free screening of “Hidden 

Figures” in her hometown, a 

membership to the New York 

Academy of Sciences and $10,000 

toward education or research in her 

field.

Maeda found out about the 

contest through the Society of 

Hispanic Professional Engineers, 

which she was involved with on 

campus, and decided to apply because 

the contest’s message resonated with 

her.

Maeda added that she is 

expecting to begin working toward 

her doctoral degree in August 2017.

The Startup Competition is 

modeled after the NBC singing 
competition “The Voice.” Each 
round weeds out contestants, and 
those who advance are presented 
with 
the 
chance 
to 
achieve 

increasing 
levels 
of 
funding, 

mentorship 
and 
professional 

networking opportunities. The 
competition awarded last year’s 
winning startup $15,000.

The competition kicked off with 

a pitch by two Engineering seniors, 
Rushil Bakhshi and Rohan Dasika, 
for a startup that aims to monitor 
local water usage.

For Bakhshi and Dasika, as 

well as their two other partners, 
creating a company that also seeks 
to incentivize people to curtail 
excessive water usage — as the 
average five-minute shower uses 
about 15 gallons of water — seemed 
a logical decision.

“When the four of us got together 

and started brainstorming ideas, 
one common thread that tied all 
the ideas together was that it had 

to impact people more than us,” 
Dasika said. “We wanted to know 
where we could reduce our water 
usage and how would we influence 
other people of our own nature to 
reduce water usage.”

Though their venture is in its 

early stages, Bakhshi believes his 
team’s ideas have the potential to 
usher in change on a broad societal 
level.

“We want to make a socio-

economic impact that empowers 
people,” Bakhshi said. “We want 
to help change the world but we 
want to change our locality first.”

As a student startup in a 

more infant stage but looking to 
tackle an old University problem, 
Maize Book aims to provide 
an online marketplace where 
Michigan students can buy and 
sell textbooks without the hassle 
of posting on Facebook or waiting 
in line at Ulrich’s.

Maize Book member John 

Falcone, 
an 
Engineering 

sophomore, 
is 
confident 
the 

group can fill a niche that needs 
to be dealt with.

“I know, having joined last 

on this team and looking at 
it 
objectively 
as 
a 
student, 

that there is no kind of one 
streamlined process to buy or sell 
your textbooks,” Falcone said. 

The 
startup, 
which 
also 

consists of Business sophomore 
Maxwell 
Frenkel 
and 

Engineering sophomore Michael 
Kalmus, 
promises 
to 
save 

students money on textbooks 
and to ensure that textbooks do 
not gather dust on bookcases or 
desks.

“I was looking under my 

desk last semester and I had a 
book from freshman year that 
is still sitting there and I paid 
way too much for it,” Frenkel 
said. “I realized there has got 
to be a better way than posting 
on Facebook about it … and 
(Maize Book) is really the only 
alternative at this point.”

For 
Frenkel, 
Maize 
Book 

represents an opportunity to deal 
with a persistent problem.

“If you are selling to other 

students, you can be a little 
more upfront about what you 
want without ripping them off,” 
Frenkel said.

Ellis Fried, another Startup 

Competition attendee and an 
LSA senior, has already seen his 

company, 
proteinbits 
LLC, 

grow from a personal desire 
for a better protein-heavy 
snack 
into 
a 
full-fledged 

operation with snacks for offer 
for sale in cafes and shops all 
over southeast Michigan.

Fried, 
a 
self-described 

nutrition and health enthusiast 
with an appetite for protein-
heavy foods, worked with a 
local chef, regional packing 
companies 
and 
student 

consulting groups to bring to 
fruition, over just the past 11 
months, a bite-sized, almond-
and-chocolate-flavored snack.

Drawing positive taste tastes 

from 
the 
assembled 
panel 

of judges, Fried said he feels 
ready to take his company from 
its University roots to wider 
horizons.

“I was nervous about running 

this company, but I think that in 
the past month or two, as I have 
been bringing on a lot of help 
with consulting clubs … and a 
distributor,” Fried said. “I have 
a lot of help and teamwork that 
is joining me now that definitely 
helps.”

government 
organizations 

recognizing the holiday, and 
I’m all for that,” Smith said.

The resolution was passed 

on 
the 
premise 
that 
the 

University is located on land 
that 
belongs 
historically 

to Native Americans, and 
that tribes are still active 
inthe state. The resolution 
notes that it complies with 

the 
University’s 
Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion plan, 
introduced on Oct. 6. Under 
the 
DEI, 
the 
University 

strives to recognize the value 
of diversity within the college 
community 
by 
bringing 

in guest speakers, holding 
campus-wide inclusion events 
and 
promoting 
progressive 

rhetoric.

The 
University, 
on 
its 

website 
dedicated 
to 
the 

comprehensive strategic plan, 
states the DEI “is based on the 
conviction that excellence is 

not possible without diversity 
in the broadest sense of the 
word.”

In keeping with the DEI, 

the writers of the resolution 
to encourage recognition of 
Indigenous Peoples’ Day hope 
that a formal holiday on the 
official Michigan calendar will 
make strides in acknowledging 
a demographic of students 
who are often, according to the 
writers, made invisible.

LSA 
sophomore 
Ayah 

Issa, one of the writers of 
the 
resolution, 
presented 

the resolution to CSG for the 
second time this week. At the 
last meeting, she stressed the 
need for a day that recognizes 
the University’s small Native 
American population, which 
is often overlooked due to its 
scale.

“This 
holiday 
will 
not 

only represent the legacy of 
indigenous people, but also 
recognize that there is a 
Native American population 
at the University of Michigan, 
and to be sensitive of that,” 
Issa said.

immigrants as rapists and 
criminals, and has called for 
a suspension on accepting 
refugees from war-torn Syria.

Though the University of 

Michigan has not declared 
itself a sanctuary campus, 
there are privacy policies in 
place barring the University 
from providing information 
about 
immigration 
status 

to authorities except under 
criminal legal situations. Ann 
Arbor also has not declared 
itself a sanctuary city, but the 
police can enforce immigration 
laws 
only 
under 
criminal 

circumstances.

A series of speakers from

Necessary, 

a 
national

civil 

rights 
organization, 
spoke 

to the council and attendees 
in 
support

protecting

Speakers 
reasoned 

undocumented 
immigrants 

will 
face 
threats 
during 

Trump’s 
presidency, 
which 

has promised of a deportation 
force and a wall on the U.S.-
Mexico border.

BAMN 
member 
Jessica 

Provinski commended Obama 
on the work he has done to 
safeguard his legacy from 
the incoming administration, 
and said she hopes to see the 
outgoing president perform 

one last move before he leaves 
office.

“(Obama) 
must 
use 
his 

executive 
power 
to 
do 

everything he can to defend 
young immigrant recipients of 
the DACA program,” Provinski 
said. “If we are to defend each 
other and our society from a 
dark future, we must protect 
the most vulnerable of us.”

Timothy Hunter, a high 

school 
teacher 
from 
the 

Washtenaw 
Independent 

School District, also urged 
everyone in attendance to 
recognize the humanity of 
the immigrant and refugee 
children he interacts with on a 
daily basis.

“These children are like all 

children,” Hunter said. “They 
want to learn, they want to 
be productive, they want to 
go to college. Some of them 
want to just work, work, work. 
They are human beings. They 
breathe, they bleed, they love, 
they are just like us.”

Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy 
(D–Ward 
1), 

who sponsored the resolution, 
recounted 
her 
childhood 

memories as a refugee in India 
during the Sri Lankan civil 
war. As a member of the Tamil 
minority who had to flee the 
island from violent Sinhalese 
mobs, 
Kailasapathy 
said 

rhetoric against immigrants 
and refugees strikes a personal 
chord with her.

“Before we left our house we 

just checked to see (its ruins),” 
Kailasapathy recalled. “There 
was a fish tank. Even the fish 
tank was pushed down. The 
fish were all dead. The people 
who came to burn our house 
were just so angry, not just 
towards us being minorities 
but our pets too. It just leaves 
a mark on you that just never 
leaves you, this blind hatred.”

Kailasapathy 
urged 

everyone in the crowd to go 
beyond their preconceptions 
and 
understand 
the 

extraordinary hardships that 
immigrants 
and 
refugees 

experience.

“I hope all of us can go 

beyond 
this 
racism 
that’s 

threatening 
this 
country,” 

Kailasapathy 
added. 

“(Refugees are) all minorities, 
and they all come from another 
country, and they’re merely 
victims. They are not to be 
treated as bad people.”

Central 
Student 

Government body members 
also passed a similar resolution 
last week. The body voted 
26-4, with seven abstaining. 
Arts and Design senior Keysha 
Walls, 
a 
BAMN 
member, 

said protecting documented 
students 
was 
Obama’s 

obligation, 
noting 
applying 

to DACA was a large risk for 
undocumented youth as it 
required personal information, 
including DNA samples, that 
could be used to identify and 
deport them.

“The 
safety 
of 
these 

undocumented 
immigrants 

is only promised under the 
Obama administration,” Wall 
said last week to the CSG 
body. “For Obama to know 
these things and not take 
every 
cautionable 
step 
to 

ensure the continued safety 
of undocumented peoples in 
this nation is disgusting and 
inhumane … If he will not 
act on his own, then we must 
take action, in doing so set the 
example for him.”

The resolution was approved 

to thunderous applause from 
attendees. 
Councilmember 

Chuck Warpehoski (D–Ward 
5), who also sponsored the 
resolution, 
praised 
it 
for 

upholding Ann Arbor’s history 
of protecting all members of the 
city’s community in spite of a 
political climate in Washington 
D.C. 
and 
Lansing 
that 
is 

unfriendly to immigrants and 
refugees.

“This action … is part of a 

longstanding tradition of the 
Ann Arbor community and 
the 
City 
Council 
speaking 

up for protection of all of our 
community members, including 
those who are immigrants,” 
Warpehoski said. “The ways 
that we’re going to support each 
other, keep each other safe, and 
have the kind of community of 
inclusion and justice that we 
want is by finding every route 
and pursuing it on a local 
level.”

results of poverty, ultimately 
working 
toward 
preventing 

it. Shaefer explained that a 
goal of the program is to enact 
policy that opens economic 
opportunities, 
reduces 

educational 
disparities 
and 

improves 
health 
in 
order 

to lift families out of low 
socioeconomic status.

“Poverty 
Solutions 
was 

launched this past October 
with 
a 
bold 
mission: 
To 

cultivate action-based research 
and 
teaching 
partnerships 

with community stakeholders 
and 
policymakers 
to 
build 

knowledge about what works in 
confronting poverty,” he said.

The collaborative program is 

co-sponsored by the University-
sponsored Detroit Community-
Academic 
Urban 
Research 

Center, 
the 
Detroit 
Health 

Department, Henry Ford Health 
System and nine community-
based 
organizations. 
The 

nine new projects, according 
to 
the 
initiative’s 
website, 

center 
around 
three 
main 

areas: “(e)xpanding economic 
opportunity to reduce poverty,” 
“(r)educing 
educational 

disparities to promote social 
mobility” 
and 
“(a)ddressing 

the health consequences of 
poverty.”

Schlissel lauded the efforts 

and urged all colleges and 
schools to consider programs 
working toward solutions to 
poverty not only in Michigan, 
but the rest of the world.

“I 
think, 
as 
a 
public 

university, our research should 
be focused on the challenges 
and opportunities that benefit 
the public that we serve,” 
Schlissel said. “My challenge as 
a university leader is to identify 
a match between what we’re 
good at, what we can bring 
to the table and what society 
needs.”

Schlissel said the initiative 

owed it to the state to aid 
impoverished areas, especially 
as Michigan residents invest 
so many resources into the 
University.

“The beauty of Michigan 

is we have representation in 
so many different academic 

areas,” Schlissel said. “My job 
is to be your biggest booster and 
provide some money.”

At a lecture in October 

2016, Carol O’Cleireacain, the 
Detroit’s 
deputy 
mayor 
for 

economic policy, planning and 
strategy, referred to Detroit as a 
“rich public policy laboratory.” 
Public Policy junior Stephen 
Wallace, 
backed 
by 
many 

audience 
members, 
publicly 

criticized 
O’Cleireacain, 

highlighting what he perceived 
as an image of Detroit’s lower-
income citizens as projects for 
research — something he found 
particularly demoralizing as a 
resident.

Shaefer, 
however, 
said 

Poverty Solutions studies are 
about more than just conducting 
an 
experiment, 
citing 
the 

expansion 
of 
community 

health workers in the Cody 
Rouge neighborhood of Detroit 
through the efforts of Michele 
Heisler, professor of internal 
medicine, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, 
medical director at the Detroit 
Health Department and Dave 
Law, executive director of the 
Joy-Southfield 
Community 

Development Corporation, who 
all sat on the live-streamed 
panel.

Heisler 
said 
even 
with 

insurance, 
many 
Medicaid 

subscribers 
in 
Detroit 
still 

face difficulty in accessing 
health care. Because of this, 
community health workers who 
live in the same community 
are receiving training to reach 
out to families and work with 
them to meet their medical 
needs. Despite the success of 
these workers, however, they 
lack the necessary job-funding, 
prompting their collaboration 
with Medicaid companies to 
now try to create a financially 
sustainable model.

“There’s a lot of evidence 

about how effective community 
health workers can be,” Heisler 
said. “The problem is that, to 
date, they’ve often just been 
supported by short-term grants. 
The idea is that you would have 
the health plans contributing 
to the salaries to support 
community health workers.”

Law said, in addition to 

health, his team can now target 
all determinants of health such 
as 
food 
access, 
community 

safety, 
housing 
and 
youth 

mentoring.

“We’ve been trying to get 

a community health program 
going for years,” Law said. “This 
will finally provide the cement 
that will allows the residents 
and the stakeholders and the 
agencies that are helping to 
promote health, come together 
and make sure people know 
what’s available.”

Khaldun added people are 

one of the most important 
resources in the city, saying 
many citizens are unable to get 
to their appointments, creating 
a need in the city for training 
for community health workers 
to help citizens to connect them 
with their resources.

“The health department is 

thought of as a brick and mortar 
in Detroit,” Khaldun said. “But 
we are bringing our services 
to the city, to the people in 
the 
neighborhoods. 
We’re 

empowering the people.”

Trina Shanks, an associate 

professor 
of 
social 
work 

who works on a summer jobs 
program in Detroit hiring 
thousands of youth for six 
weeks, said there must be jobs 
available for young people in 
low-income 
neighborhoods 

who are not in school or not 
working. 
By 
empowering 

young people early with jobs, 
Shanks said, such programs 
can put children on a path 
toward a successful career 
later in life.

“The young people felt they 

were 
contributing 
to 
their 

families,” Shanks said. “We 
went from having a couple of 
thousand jobs in Detroit to 
7,000, and we grew. Now that 
we’ve 
grown 
the 
numbers, 

we’re 
also 
building 
the 

infrastructure.”

Schlissel said all these ideas 

are well-intentioned, but must 
be extensively studied to figure 
out what the best approaches 
are to help as many people as 
possible out of poverty.

“The sweet thing to me 

about this is the University 
isn’t stepping in and behaving 
like a social services entity,” 
Schlissel said. “We’re behaving 
like researchers and teachers 
providing some organization 
but also studying how this gets 
implemented.”

said. “We are number one 
both in terms of number 
of manufacturing jobs and 
growth-rate percentage.”

In 
response 
to 
Snyder’s 

positive 
economic 
report, 

Jim Ananich (D–Flint), state 
Senate minority leader, said in 
a statement he feels as though 
average 
families 
are 
not 

experiencing the full extent of 
the recovery.

“Governor Snyder speaks 

about an economic recovery, 
but the people I talk to every 
day still don’t feel it in their 
wallets,” 
Ananich 
said. 

“Michigan’s seniors, students 
and 
middle-class 
families 

continue to get the short end of 
the stick thanks to the last six 
years of bad Republican policies 
coming out of Lansing.”

Midway 
through 
his 

address, Snyder pivoted from 
touting Michigan’s economic 
progress to speaking about 
the 
challenges 
still 
facing 

Flint after the water crisis, the 
central focus of his address last 
year.

“This was a sad chapter 

in the history of our state: 
Last year the people of Flint 
suffered 
an 
unacceptable 

crisis. I made a commitment 
to the people of Flint to fix it,” 
Snyder said. “We’ve worked 
tirelessly to make Flint’s water 
safe to drink again and improve 
the entire city of Flint — we’re 
making progress, but we’re not 
done yet.”

Snyder 
said 
he 
feels 

progress has been made and 
said $27 million of state funds 
were provided for lead pipe 
replacement, 
24,000 
new 

Flint residents were placed 
on Medicaid waivers and 827 
new jobs were created in the 
community. 
Furthermore, 

Snyder said he would introduce 
higher water standards and 
better testing protocols for 
copper and lead than the 
federal government currently 
has in place.

Rep. Dan Kildee (D–Flint) 

issued a statement following 
the address, condemning the 
governor for not devoting more 
time to talk about and propose 

additional solutions.

“Shame on the governor for 

not using tonight to outline 
additional steps that he is going 
to take to ensure clean drinking 
water in Flint,” Kildee said in a 
statement. “I will not rest until 
the governor and the state step 
up to do more to help the city 
recover from this man-made 
crisis.”

After 
the 
roughly 
two-

minute section of his address 
devoted 
to 
Flint, 
Snyder 

continued on the theme of 
infrastructure, saying billions 
of dollars will be needed for 
roads, pipes and updating the 
Soo Lock shipping channel in 
Sault Ste. Marie.

“Michigan residents deserve 

safe, 
reliable, 
sustainable 

infrastructure,” Snyder said. 
“We need to invest more, we 
need to literally invest billions 
of dollars of new investment 
over the next several decades.”

On the topic of education, 

Snyder said continued and new 
investments in early education, 
in computer science education 
and for women in STEM are 
forthcoming.

“We need to give our kids 

the education that gives them 
the skills and judgement they 
need to achieve quality careers, 
start families and to give back 
to their communities,” Snyder 
said.

State Sen. Geoff Hansen 

(R–Hart) said in an interview 
with the Daily he was pleased 
with the governor’s address, 
particularly 
his 
mention 

of continuing to push for 
technical 
education 
and 

computer science jobs.

“There’s 
a 
big 
need 
in 

Michigan right now: We’ve got 
about 80,000 engineering jobs 
open,” Hansen said. “I think 
it’s important we continue 
working with everybody to 
provide education based on 
what job opportunities there 
are.”

On specific issues pertaining 

to the University of Michigan, 
like sexual assault prevention, 
Snyder mentioned the initiative 
to end sexual assault on college 
campuses led by Michigan’s 
first lady, Sue Snyder.

This is the second time 

the University has received 
funding 
to 
address 
sexual 

assualt from the state. Synder 
spoke on the grant a summit 
on North Campus, and the 
University 
was 
awarded 

a $100,000 state grant in 
December.

“We need to do everything 

we can to keep our college 
and 
university 
campuses 

safe; Michigan has become a 
national leader on this,” Snyder 
said. “We’re doing grants to 
multiple colleges — 18 colleges 
and 
universities 
— 
with 

$500,000 in grants to do better 
on this topic, we need to keep 
that up.”

Additionally, Snyder touched 

on 
Mcity, 
the 
University’s 

autonomous-car 
testing 

center on North Campus, in 
his address as being part of 
the effort to place Michigan 
at the forefront of the world’s 
autonomous car development 
and testing.

“We 
are 
winning 
the 

mobility race, but we have 
to keep it up,” Snyder said. 
“We have wonderful assets 
like Mcity, the new American 
Center for Mobility, we have 
smart highways … we are 
the world’s leader today, we 
need to continue to be the 
world’s leader, we need to be 
the catalyst for the world and 
invite all parts of the world to 
join us in doing this in a safe, 
smart way.”

Concluding 
his 
address, 

Snyder said he is looking 
forward to this next year, 
his last in office as governor, 
and encouraged citizens to 
help him in making a positive 
difference in the state.

“Let’s go get this done,” 

Snyder said.

R

eading Trump’s Twitter 
rants is the best form 
of entertainment. You 

never know what he will say or 
who he will insult 
next. 
No 
one 
is 

safe from his social 
media-based 
shots. 

Not 
Alec 
Baldwin, 

not 
Meryl 
Streep, 

not even his fellow 
Republicans like Paul 
Ryan. Trump takes 
to Twitter to insult 
anyone who doesn’t 
completely agree with 
him, so it is no shock 
he went after congressman and 
civil rights legend John Lewis.

Trump’s timing is impeccable 

because if you’re going to call a 
man who has dedicated his life to 
public service and civil rights “all 
talk” and “no action,” you might 
as well do it on Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day weekend. Many 
people use the long weekend to 
reflect on and celebrate the work 
of King and other civil rights 
protesters. But Trump, always 
looking to shake up the status 
quo, took a unique approach.

If Trump needs to see Lewis do 

something, he can turn on almost 
any documentary about the civil 
rights movement and see Lewis 
marching and organizing to end 
segregation. 
However, 
based 

on Trump’s attitude, I suspect 
that he would call Lewis taking 
part in the Freedom Rides “just 
sitting down in a bus.” When he 
watches Lewis take hit after hit 
from a policeman’s nightstick, 
sees Lewis pushed to the ground 
and look up only to see the stick 
coming toward him again, he 
would say “he just fell down.” 
Though it is not a documentary, 
I 
recommend 
Trump 
watch 

the 2015 film “Selma,” since he 
doubts that Lewis is a man of 
action. Then hopefully he will 
realize that his statements about 
Lewis are completely false.

In 
the 
tweet, 
Trump 

specifically 
attacks 
Lewis’s 

public 
service 
record, 
so 
I 

assume he means to define 
action as vocalizing the concerns 
of constituents and working 
to address issues within the 
district. Lewis’s district faces 
challenges, 
including 
poverty 

and unemployment, but it is also 
considered a tech hub. One of its 
cities, Atlanta, was rated one of 

the “fastest growing metro areas 
from 2013 to 2015.” Trump’s 
tweets overemphasize the issues 
and completely ignore the positive 

characteristics of the 
district. Citing a few 
negative 
statistics 

and using them to 
represent an entire 
district 
does 
not 

provide a complete 
characterization 
of 

the district.

Trump, 
even 

though 
he 
is 
the 

president-elect, is in 
no place to criticize 

Lewis’s political experience and 
work. Besides his presidential 
campaign, 
Trump 
has 
no 

experience in public service. 
While Lewis spoke with his 
constituents and sponsored and 
introduced bills in the House 
of 
Representatives, 
Trump 

made a name for himself in real 
estate and numerous business 
ventures. This, in addition to 
the fact that Trump has no 
experience living in Georgia’s 
fifth district, leaves Trump 
unqualified 
to 
make 
these 

claims. If he wants to tweet 
about someone who’s “all talk” 
and “no action” in the realm 
of politics, I suggest he tweet 
about himself.

Maybe he forgot that he’s 

supposed to be president, but 
in any case, going on Twitter 
rants like these is a waste of 
time and should not be the 
behavior of an elected official. 
It’s fantastic that politicians 
can use social media to interact 
with their constituents; using 
social media makes politicians 
less like political figures or 
images only seen on TV or 
heard in the news, and more like 
relatable people. New Jersey 
Sen. Cory Booker, one of the 
people on Trump’s growing 
list of enemies, embraces social 
media; he Snapchatted while 
he 
campaigned 
for 
Hillary 

Clinton. Social media is a great 
way for politicians to connect 
with constituents, but it should 
not make national news nearly 
every week and should not be 
used to insult others.

Instead of tweeting, Trump 

needs to direct his attention to 
his upcoming job. He needs to 
receive the presidential daily 
briefings every day, not just when 

he feels like it. He needs to figure 
out how to unite the country. On 
Friday, the task of addressing the 
concerns of all Americans will 
pass to his shoulders. He won’t 
be able to effectively complete 
this task if he can’t put his phone 
down. How will he have time to 
“make America great again” if he 
is too distracted by his Twitter?

Trump’s tweet about Lewis is 

another example of how much 
Trump loves to stir up drama 
through social media. He can’t 
help himself — tweeting hurtful 
statements is his favorite pastime. 
But this type of behavior is 
unacceptable for anyone. When 
we see the first signs of it in kids, 
we take them aside and explain 
why it is not OK.

Unfortunately, 
no 
matter 

how many times we tell Trump 
to stop insulting people, to act 
like an adult and not like the 
school bully, the message never 
sticks. For someone who claims 
to be a “smart person,” he can’t 
seem to figure out that insulting 
everyone who doesn’t share 
his ideas and beliefs is wrong. 
Trump cannot effectively work 
with anyone if he constantly 
attacks people who say anything 
against him on Twitter. Before 
his inauguration, he needs to 
realize that people will say 
things he doesn’t like and that 
should not encourage him to 
incite a Twitter war.

Any time I read or hear 

about Trump’s latest tweets, I 
always ask in exasperation “Can 
someone please take Twitter 
away from him?” But part of me 
likes seeing all the ridiculous 
statements 
on 
his 
Twitter 

account. It gives a clear look into 
the mind of the future president. 
His tweets are more honest 
than any speech he will give, 
any statement he will make, any 
action he will do. On Twitter, he 
disregards what few standards 
he sets for his behavior. He can 
give a speech written by writers 
and reviewed by his staff, but 
what he tweets off the top of his 
head without time for anyone to 
check him or tell him to stop is 
where we see the true Trump. 
While I dislike him, I want to 
know what I’ll be stuck dealing 
with for the next four years.

Plastic bags, one of the 

auxiliary 
containers 
the 

Michigan 
bill 
prohibits 

regulating, 
are 
often 
not 

recyclable and can take years to 
decompose. Due to their shape, 
plastic bags snag on conveyer 
belts used to sort recyclable 
materials before repurposing 
and 
hinder 
machines’ 
and 

workers’ progress. They billow 
out of collection trucks and 
into the streets, where they 
become tumbleweeds of the 
city, twisting in the wind and 
eventually ending up in tree 
branches, 
drainage 
systems 

and waterways. From there, 
wildlife can get trapped in or 
consume these plastic bags, 
choking them or filling their 
stomachs 
with 
indigestible 

plastic. Not to mention, as the 
Great Lakes State, we must 
be mindful of our fragile 
freshwater ecosystem and work 
to protect this environment 
and its wildlife at all costs.

This legislation is at odds 

with Michigan’s Bottle Deposit 
Law, which added a 10-cent 
deposit to bottles and cans 
as a means of decreasing the 
number of cans and bottles in 
landfills. This deposit helps 
fund cleanup, development and 
pollution-prevention 
efforts 

across Michigan. Consumers 
can earn the 10-cent deposit 
back by returning the items 
to return centers in grocery 

stores, making this legislation 
friendly for people’s wallets as 
well as the environment.

Michigan is not the first 

state to propose legislation 
surrounding 
the 
regulation 

of 
single 
use 
containers. 

Other states such as Alabama, 
Idaho and Missouri have also 
banned the banning of plastic 
bags. Washington D.C. has 
implemented a plastic bag tax, 
which has generated a large 
amount of revenue allocated 
toward 
environmental 
and 

social issues. California voters 
last year also approved the 
nation’s first statewide ban on 
plastic bags, which is estimated 
to remove 15 billion pieces of 
plastic each year once the ban 
takes effect.

A 
10-cent 
tax 
won’t 

eliminate 
plastic 
bags 
and 

their 
environmental 
impact 

— only a well-enforced ban 

similar to California’s will do 
that. However, the production 
of paper bags has a larger 
carbon footprint than that of 
the production of plastic bags, 
which calls into question the 
degree to which banning plastic 
bags outright would have a 
positive impact. Furthermore, 
a tax would also allow the 
state to allocate more funds 
toward cleanup and pollution 
prevention 
measures; 
a 

statewide ban would eliminate 
this source of revenue.

Though a 10-cent tax may 

seem relatively inconsequential 
to those carrying extra change, 
this universal tax could have 
potentially stressful effects on 
citizens who already struggle 
to 
pay 
for 
groceries 
and 

cannot afford the alternative 
reusable canvas bags. Still, the 
tax would force all citizens, 
regardless of socioeconomic 
status, to be mindful of their 
consumption 
of 
the 
non-

recyclable bags.

Nonetheless, 
the 
bill 

passed by the Michigan state 
Senate will leave containers 
like plastic unregulated and 
therefore more likely to pollute 
the 
environment 
through 

production 
or 
disposal. 
A 

statewide 
tax, 
which 
gets 

people to think twice about 
plastic bag use and promotes 
the recycling of plastic bags, is 
closer to the ideal solution.

Short, but not so sweet

ANNA POLUMBO-LEVY | OP-ED

A

s much as I attempt 
to read as many New 
York 
Times 
and 

Atlantic articles as I possibly 
can, I confess: It just isn’t 
feasible. Given my school work, 
extracurriculars and attempt to 
get what’s considered a healthy 
amount of sleep, I just don’t have 
the time I’d like to sit down for 
hours and pore over every news 
outlet, read every breaking story 
and debate the findings. That’s 
why I’ve recently begun to swear 
by The New York Times’ morning 
briefings, essentially one- to 
two-sentence summaries of what 
the brief writers considered 
some of the most important news 
stories that day. This way, I feel 
as though I am staying up to date 
with the latest news.

About a week ago, The New 

York Times added a section 
called 
“Smarter 
Living: 

Morning Edition.” While the 
contents of the first edition of 
this new section were off to a 
positive, seemingly encouraging 
start — including reminders to 
stay positive and giving me a few 
tips to relieve my stress — the 
second Smarter Living edition 
struck a different cord. Scrolling 
past the section title, a plug for 
one of the stories caught my eye: 
“Miss your morning meal? Don’t 
sweat it — the science around the 
importance of breakfast is still 
basically unproven.” In it was a 
link to a piece on how breakfast 
may not be as important as we 
thought, because according to 
the article’s writer, many of the 
studies that corroborate this 
stance are weak at best.

While I don’t have too much of 

a problem with the fact that the 
author sets about to debunk the 
myth of breakfast being the most 

important meal of the day, the 
intentionally short plug — meant 
to hook the reader and recap the 
piece — was worded in such a 
way that its writer appeared 
oblivious to the harmful ways 
in which our society discusses 
eating. If I hadn’t clicked on the 
accompanying article, I might 
read the takeaway as one that 
deemphasizes the importance 
of eating more generally. The 
plug implies people should 
focus on eating less, but the 
piece focuses on debunking the 
theory that breakfast is the most 
important meal.

What’s even more jarring to 

me is the fact that if I suffered 
from an eating disorder, I might 
have read this short sentence and 
seen it as another affirmation 
of our society’s values. Instead 
of taking a flippant attitude 
toward 
skipping 
meals, 
we 

should be re-examining the way 
we talk about food. Even though 
this short sentence to draw in 
a reader may be misleading, 
what if this is how you get your 
news? We are a society that puts 
thinness on a pedestal; from the 
dimensions of Barbie to the style 
tips that tell us what colors will 
make us look thinner, we are 
constantly made self-conscious 
of our bodies. And though 
many eating disorders are about 
control, not so much food itself, 
there is no doubt that American 
society often emphasizes one 
ideal size.

As 
a 
young 
college-aged 

woman, 
fitting 
within 
the 

demographics most at risk for 
eating disorders and body image 
issues, this anecdote is especially 
alarming to me. According to 
the National Eating Disorders 
Association website, in 2011, 20 
million women and 10 million 
men in the United States suffered 
from 
some 
type 
of 
eating 

disorder. In fact, girls as young 

as 6 are concerned with their 
weight or figure.

Instead 
of 
encouraging 

people to eat, short statements 
such as these tell a society 
(and 
anyone 
else 
reading 

this) where many are already 
hyperconscious of their body 
that eating isn’t very important. 
(That said, I acknowledge that 
there is a significant number of 
people who are not a huge fan of 
all meals, and if they want to skip 
a meal, that is their prerogative.) 

But it is the job of journalists 

to be careful of every word 
they put out there — every 
phrase they shorten to make it 
fit into a briefing, every word 
they decide to use to pack more 
of a punch — because words 
matter. For the most part, I 
firmly believe that the fewer 
words you use to say things, the 
better. We need to think twice 
if we are attempting to boil 
something down that actually 
requires a more fleshed-out 
explanation, or we risk it being 
misinterpreted. For the young 
woman who, simply judging 
by her demographic as a young 
woman, already has a high 
risk of possibly developing an 
eating disorder, how does this 
seemingly inconsequential (yet 
attention-grabbing) 
sentence 

about how harmless it is to skip 
breakfast affect her? Something 
so stark published by a well-
regarded publication like the 
Times has the power to help or 
harm in significant ways.

It is the job of the Times 

and all publications — in fact, 
all journalists, friends, family, 
authors 
and 
government 

officials — to think: If I condense 
something complex down into 
so few words, am I doing more 
harm than good?

State should reconsider bag ban
L

ast month, Michigan’s Lt. Gov. Brian Calley signed a law that will 
prevent local governments from taxing or restricting the use of 
“auxiliary containers,” defined as single or multi-use bags, cups, 

bottles or other packaging. This comes after Washtenaw County passed an 
ordinance last June to charge a 10-cent fee for paper and plastic grocery bags 
that would have gone into effect this April. With this statewide ban, we will 
continue to see the harmful effects of plastic bags and other non-recyclable 
containers on the environment and deny the state a possible source of revenue 
that could be used to counter those effects. While legislators cited a desire to 
not force a patchwork of laws regarding these containers on state businesses, 
The Michigan Daily’s editorial board believes the best course of action 
should be to pass a statewide tax on plastic bags, thereby enforcing one law 
across the state and discouraging the use of harmful disposable containers.

“Hidden Figures” uplifts
NASA’s unsung heroes

Film highlights necessity of professional diversity and the 
ability storytelling has to retroactively write history

Exiting the movie theater 

last week, I heard snippets of 
a conversation about “Hidden 
Figures.” 
“I 

grew up in the 
same 
town 
as 

her,” a woman 
said, referring to 
one of the main 
characters. “And 
I 
didn’t 
even 

know that she 
did that much 
until later.”

If 
this 
tells 

us anything, it’s 
that storytelling 
is 
powerful. 

Following 
Katherine 

Johnson (Taraji P. Henson, 
“Empire”), a physicist and 
mathematician 
who 
made 

seminal 
contributions 
to 

celestial 
navigation, 
Mary 

Jackson (Janelle Monáe, “The 
Electric Lady”), NASA’s first 
black female engineer, and 
Dorothy 
Vaughan 
(Octavia 

Spencer, “The Help”), NASA’s 
first black female supervisor, 
“Hidden Figures” understands 
that what goes unsaid is often 
what says it all.

Despite 
their 
college 

degrees 
and 
unparalleled 

technical 
capabilities, 
the 

women 
face 
innumerable 

barriers, big and small, to 
succeed as black women in 

STEM. “If you were a white 
man, would you want to be an 
engineer?” a colleague asks 
Mary.

“I wouldn’t want to be an 

engineer, because I’d already 
be one,” she replies. The film 
outlines just some of the 

reasons 
why: 

A NASA policy 
requires that all 
engineers take a 
specific 
course 

only 
offered 

by 
segregated 

schools. 
When 

Katherine 
joins 
an 
all-

white 
team, 

she is provided 
a 
“colored” 

coffee 
machine 

exclusively 
for 

her use. She runs half a mile in 
heels through the parking lot 
because not a single colored 
restroom exists in the entire 
building complex.

Every shot is staged to make 

the 
discomfort 

known. Katherine 
walks 
into 
a 

sterile sea of white 
button-downs and 
black 
ties. 
The 

only color present 
comes 
from 
the 

cardigans worn by 
the two women in 
the room, and her 
dark skin.

“Hidden 

Figures” aims to 
undo 
superstar 

culture, 
splitting 

hierarchy 
down 

to its core and revealing the 
multitudes of people that really 
make genius happen. Dorothy 
says, “progress for one of us 
is progress for us all,” and it’s 
evident in the making of the 
film. While it sheds light on 
three incredible black women, 
“Hidden Figures” also pays 
tribute to the partners, children, 
churches and role models that 
empower them. Dorothy doesn’t 
just aspire to be a supervisor 
for 
herself. 
She 
stubbornly 

stands by her girls in the colored 

computing team to ensure the 
security of their futures at 
NASA, refusing to advance if 
other they can’t advance, too.

The space race contextualizes 

the 
civil 
rights 
movement 

within a foreign policy context. 
While this has a positive effect 
of categorizing people not by 
race, but as Americans on equal 
footing, its unrealistic execution 
makes it a distraction. With 
simplistic 
and 
unnecessary 

dialogue, John Glenn’s boyish, 
Labrador 
Retriever 
charm 

verges on dopey. The highly 
unrealistic space CGI also takes 
away from the heartwarming 
storyline of the women.

Still, 
it’s 
a 
feel-good 

movie, 
stuffed 
with 

sweeping 
monologues 
and 

snappy 
comebacks 
against 

microaggressions. 
Though 

it’s 
unlikely 
that 
every 

conversation 
occurred 
in 

reality, the film does not 
sugarcoat how hard black 
women 
fough; 
how 
hard 

they 
still 

fight 
today. 

Instead, 
the 

optimism 
in 
“Hidden 

Figures” acts 
as 
a 
voice 

clapping 
back 
against 

racism, 
speaking 
for 

all 
people 

color 
who 

cannot 
speak out for 
themselves.

Even 
for 

viewers, “Hidden Figures” has 
the power to bring together 
communities, 
eliciting 
the 

most sniffling I’ve heard in 
a theater as of late. “C’mon, 
seriously!” someone muttered 
from behind me when the door 
of the command room closed 
in Octavia’s face. The theater 
erupted in applause when the 
supervisor who once actively 
emphasized 
her 
inferiority 

and lack of belonging passed 
by her desk and made her a cup 
of coffee.

Daily Arts Wrtier

SOHN’s ‘Rennen’ a weak, 
gloomy sophomore release

London-raised, 
Vienna-made 

and 
now 
Los 
Angeles-based 

Christopher Taylor — or SOHN 
— just dropped his second album 
after almost three years of silence. 
The record’s title, 
Rennen, 
translates 

from 
German 
to 

“run.” 
With 
this 

follow up to his 
successful 
debut, 

SOHN 
found 

himself itching to pivot away from 
the snowy Austrian capital where 
he made his first album, Tremors, 
in 2014. The artist elaborates, “I 
went from holing up in a dark 
studio in Vienna, leaving at 6am 
and trudging through the snow 
to get home, to being on a ranch 
in the California hills, worried 
that a fire’s going to sweep across 
and 
blow 
everything 
away.” 

Ironically, it seems the moody, 
wintry 
atmosphere 
charged 

Tremors 
with 
the 
signature 

spark that set SOHN apart in the 
electro-indie arena. Despite his 
sunny shift in scenery, SOHN 
seems proccupied by the shadow 
of looming loss that the hills of LA 
cast over his headspace — a shadow 
that dimmed the emotional impact 
of Rennen.

The majority of the record’s 

poignant songs are placed at its 
opening. “Hard Liquor” is a pulsing, 
soulful track that peaks at the 
ringing harmonies of the chorus. 

Its sexy title and electronic layers 
are dulled by the surface-level, 
redundant lyrics. For example, 
he sings repetitively, “she needs 
her hard liquor/give her that hard 
liquor/and she’ll be ok.”

“Conrad,” the second of Rennen’s 

three singles, matures lyrically and 
maintains the bassy funk of the first 
track. Initially, it sounds like an 

80’s jam as SOHN 
croons, “I can feel 
it comin’ we can 
never go back” in a 
Michael 
Jackson-

esque tenor range. 
The 
production 

progresses into a synthy, frenetic 
collage that leads listeners into 
the 
meditative 
“Signal.” 
The 

anticlimactic third track is laced 
with 
an 
eastern-influenced 

riff — the only component that 
keeps listeners attention until it’s 
almost-cringey conclusion. 

“Dead Wrong” and “Primary” 

are at times both disjointed and 
screechy — the former shows wood-
clinking hints of a Glass Animals 
knock off, while “Primary” is 
grounded in unintriguing vocals 
and a generally messy electronic 
mix.

SOHN simmers down into an 

echoing piano ballad for the record’s 
eponymous track. Its ethereal call-
and-response vocals occasionally 
overlap into chill inducing, weepy 
harmonies. The layered voices 
act as a reminder of the depth and 
captivating energy that pervaded 
Tremors — a depth that Rennen, for 
the most part, lacks.

“Proof” attempts a last shot 

at this sensual appeal before the 
album winds down in its concluding 
tracks. Loaded with distorted oohs 
and ahs, creaky bass vibrations 
and intermittent audible exhales, 
“Proof” is enticing. Beyond 
its sexual surface — lines like 
“skin to skin … I know that 
you need me now” — SOHN 
suggests 
something 
deeper, 

sighing, “yeah, we believe in a 
system, a system but everybody 
knows it’s wrong.”

There 
is 
more 
brooding 

beneath the somber surface 
of 
Rennen’s 
concluding 

track, “Harbour,” as well. If 
listeners somehow make it to 
the last minute of this song 
(the last minute of the album, 
actually) they’ll be surprised 
by a sudden, suspense-inducing 
assault of pixelated noise. The 
conclusion of “Harbour” could 
effectively act as the the ending 
song of a “Mission Impossible” 
soundtrack – one that strikes 
when the screen goes black and 
reads, “to be continued.” It’s 
the type of frenzied song that 
beats in the background as the 
audience sits in a theatre, entranced 
by an uncalled-for finale.

The 
album’s 
finish 
will 

seldom be reached, though, 
for the majority of Rennen’s 
alluring ambiance occurs at the 
front end of the album. Beyond 
a 
handful 
of 
ear-perking 

melodies 
and 
invigorating 

beats, SOHN seems to have lost 
some of the electro-lushness 
that set the bar high for his 
follow up record.

Worldstar and the insidious 

appeal of online schadenfreude

If you peruse the Internet 

endlessly like me, you are bound 
to have seen a viral video of a fight 
break out. It was probably recorded 
on a low-quality camera phone and 
has received thousands, possibly 
millions, 
of 
views. 

They can appear as 
either single clips or 
compilations, 
with 

the 
latter 
showing 

extended clips of other 
ridiculous stuff, like 
pranks gone wrong 
or outrageous public 
sexual 
acts. 
While 

videos 
of 
school 

and 
street 
fights 

are intended to be 
funny, they instead 
normalize violence by 
portraying a fight as 
entertainment.

One of the biggest outlets of 

these kinds of videos is WorldStar 
Hip Hop, a video blog that has 
been producing online content 
since 2005. As of 2013, WorldStar 
has garnered a large following, 
currently coming in at 1.76M 
followers on Twitter, nearly 7 
million likes on Facebook, 3.8 
million YouTube subscribers and 
7.2m 
followers 
on 
Instagram. 

With its multifaceted platform, 
WorldStar has pervaded nearly 
every facet of social media, playing 
a particularly influential role on the 
now-defunct Vine. 

WorldStar 
Hip 
Hop 
isn’t 

completely devoted to producing 
explicitly violent content; the site 
has been instrumental in promoting 
Black voices through music videos, 
intimate 
behind-the-scenes 

features, breathtaking rap battles 
and other original content. In fact, 
it reposts and shares many non-
violent videos that are genuinely 
funny and captivating. At the same 
time, though, it’s astonishing that 
WorldStar is mostly known for 
being unapologetic in distributing 
violent content.

Perhaps a counter argument 

would suggest that WorldStar is 
simply capturing the uncensored, 
unfiltered reality of certain public 
schools and neighborhoods in 
America. But the kind of violence 
in these videos are depicted as 
“shock value” humor, priming its 

viewers with a funny, eye-catching 
caption like “Racist Guys Attack An 
Interracial Couple In Washington 
State!” or “Dude Calls Classmate 
The “N” Word Then Runs For 
His Life Yelling “Help Me”!” By 

pulling viewers in with 
these insane headlines, 
people can laugh more 
easily at the misfortunes 
of whoever is getting 
punched, 
kicked 
or 

beaten in the video. 
There’s something so 
sinister 
about 
shock 

value that it makes you 
wonder why people find 
violence entertaining in 
the first place.

In addition to the 

brutal 
violence, 
what 

bothers me most about 

WorldStar videos, as well as its other 
amateur, copycat sites like Quality 
Fights (28.8k Twitter followers) 
and Vine Fights (165k Twitter 
followers), is that they perpetuate 
and generalize stereotypes about 
the people they depict in the video. 
Take Sharkeisha, for example. In 
November 2013, WorldStar posted 
a one-and-a-half minute clip from 
Instagram of a woman named 
Sharkeisha 
sucker-punching 
a 

friend, who seemed totally non-
confrontational in the video.

As the video circulated and 

gained millions of views, the 
Internet reacted in various ways. 
Some expressed shock, disgust 
and 
disbelief, 
including 
the 

family of ShaMichael Manuel, the 
woman who Sharkeisha sucker-
punched. According to a report 
from the New York Daily News, 
ShaMichael’s 
mother 
shunned 

people for “glorifying Sharkeisha” 
and simultaneously “taunting my 
daughter.” Others, however, were 
undeterred by the video’s violence, 
as Sharkeisha became a hit meme 
among Twitter and Vine users and 
even got her own definition on 
Urban Dictionary. On November 
27th, the day after the video was 
published, 
“Sharkeisha” 
had 

become the number one trending 
topic on Twitter and the third most 
searched keyword of the day on 
Google Trends. Nothing, not even 
Sharkeisha’s punching, seemed to 
stop the Internet from spreading 

her name everywhere.

At the time, the Sharkeisha 

phenomenon may have seemed 
like a humorous addition to the 
Internet’s world of strange viral 
videos. But as Hip Hop Wired 
pointed out in an article a day after 
the video’s release, people who find 
this funny will “think this is the 
sort of classless behavior typical 
of any and all Black women.” 
Sharkeisha may have an odd name 
and a physical strength unknown 
to mankind, but her sudden act of 
brutal violence against an innocent 
person, as promoted by WorldStar 
and other online outlets, is far 
from funny. It’s shameful not just 
for the way it depicts the violence 
and distorts the identity of the 
person who caused it, but also for 
neglecting the victim of the fight 
almost entirely. This is just one of 
many examples of popular videos 
that normalize and perpetuate 
unmediated 
violence 
without 

considering the consequences.

Why do we laugh at other 

people’s 
misfortunes? 
Do 
we 

genuinely find school fights and 
public embarrassment funny or 
are they so startling that they 
naturally elicit an uncomfortable 
chuckle? Are we so masochistic 
that our sense of morality has 
been completely drained by the 
devious inner workings of social 
media? The Internet is obsessed 
with violence, but this notion 
isn’t a new development. Across 
most mediums, people consume 
violent content, whether through 
staged fighting on WWE or the 
Transformers franchise. There’s 
even a movie coming out this 
year called “Fist Fight” about two 
grown-ass male teachers (played 
by Charlie Day and Ice Cube) who 
engage in a classic, old-school fight 
in front of their school. It’ll probably 
score big at the box office.

But what is most troubling about 

these videos, specifically the ones 
found on WorldStar’s website, is 
that they spread faster and become 
far more pervasive through social 
media. Watching people beat each 
other up is certainly a fascinating 
way to observe human behavior, but 
it’s not productive or entertaining 
in any way. To put it simply, it’s 
dangerous and needs to be stopped.

Historical fiction dramas can be 

boring. Supernatural dramas can 
be exciting. So what happens when 
you combine the two genres? You 
get something like FX’s new limited 
series, “Taboo,” which is not quite 
exciting, but not com-
pletely boring either.

Given its ambigu-

ity and lengthy run 
time (each episode 
is almost an hour 
long), “Taboo” is a 
demanding show. It 
draws viewers in with 
elegant performances 
and visual splendor, 
but has trouble main-
taining its audience’s 
attention as it lacks urgency and 
emotional resonance. The series 
requires full concentration in order 
to completely comprehend the 
story, yet it barely gives an idea of 
where the show is headed.

Despite these flaws, “Taboo” 

is rewarding for its much more 
substantial qualities. It includes a 
riveting title sequence, intriguing 
cinematography, gothic imagery 
drenched in gloomy colors and, 
most importantly, some damn good 
acting, particularly from the per-
fectly cast Tom Hardy (“Legend”) 
and the always reliable Jonathan 
Pryce (“Game of Thrones”).

Produced and created by Hardy, 

his father Edward Hardy and 
director Steven Knight (“Locke”), 
“Taboo” succeeds with its super-
natural and atmospheric thrills, 

but falters in its suspense buildup 
and overall sense of dread. Set in 
1814 London, the story revolves 
around James Delaney (Hardy), 
a formidable man presumed dead 
who returns to Britain to avenge 
his father’s death and claim his 
inherited stretch of land. With no 
warning, Delaney’s sudden resur-
rection spooks the locals and the 

people closest to 
him — namely, his 
half-sister/possible 
secret lover Zilpha 
(Oona 
Chaplin, 

“Black 
Mirror”), 

her cruel husband 
Thorne (Jefferson 
Hall, 
“Vikings”) 

and 
Sir 
Stuart 

Strange 
(Pryce), 

the 
charismatic 

chairman of the 

East India Company.

While each character possesses 

shades of complexity, the greatest 
strength of “Taboo” is its protago-
nist. With his signature gruff grum-
ble and imposing physique, Hardy 
transforms Delaney into a perplex-
ing yet fascinating and believable 
antihero. He drives the show’s 
mystery, reflecting the enigma of 
his character through his looming 
presence over a morally corrupt 
Britain. Thorne, Sir Stuart and oth-
ers perceive him as a barbarian, 
but by exhibiting a sophisticated 
demeanor, 
Delaney 
contradicts 

both his doubters and the viewers. 
Nevertheless, he also seems capable 
of animalistic impulses. In addi-
tion to being a threatening figure, 
Delaney is haunted by troubling 
visions and demonic hallucinations 

from his travels to Africa, where he 
stayed for 12 years before coming 
back home.

No one seems to know exactly 

who Delaney is, what his true inten-
tions are or what actions he is will-
ing to take in order to get what he 
wants. This character is exactly 
what powers “Taboo;” a disappoint-
ment considering the show doesn’t 
seem concerned with making its 
plot or themes a larger priority. 
“Taboo” is at best mediocre and at 
worst languid, but given its striking 
main character, it has the potential 
to develop into a much more layered 
story.

“Taboo” falls on familiar themes 

from other British dramas — a for-
bidden romance, eloquent historical 
dialogue, the socioeconomic clash 
between the rich and the poor. But 
for some reason, the series differs 
from the conventional period piece. 
The show is in that weird, uncom-
fortable limbo, where it verges on 
being something transcendent, but 
instead settles for being just alright, 
relying mostly on its remarkable 
lead to carry it along. 

Part of FX’s phenomenal pro-

gramming, “Taboo” certainly lends 
to the network’s thematic and aes-
thetic diversity with its compelling 
visuals and deliberately paced sto-
rytelling. Next to “Atlanta,” “The 
Americans” and “Fargo,” however, 
“Taboo” is not at the same level of 
incredible, entertaining storytell-
ing (at least, not yet). For patient 
viewers, “Taboo” can be a real treat, 
especially for fans of Hardy’s previ-
ous work. But for those looking for 
something more engaging, “Taboo” 
may not be the right show.

Necto nightclub on an ordi-

nary Friday night is always a 
great place to begin the week-
end with your friends. But this 
past Friday, January 13th, was 
no ordinary night. The line to 
get into the club stretched far 
around the corner, and a buzz 
of excitement so tangible you 
could almost feel the energy 
radiating off of people, could 
only mean one thing: Katya was 
here. Katya Zamolodchikova 
is a performance artist well 
versed in the art of drag. Drag 
is when a person, typically 
male, dresses as a woman and 
exaggerate certain character-
istics for comic, dramatic or 
satirical effect. An alumna of 
two seasons from the hit tele-
vision series “RuPaul’s Drag 
Race,” Katya has garnered a 
large fan base from all over the 
country. She is known for her 
outlandish and twisted sense 
of humor, flexibility and ability 
to personify her character as 
a high-class “Russian whore.” 
Recently, she was a contestant 
on the second All-Stars sea-
son of “Drag Race” where she 
placed as a runner up.

In the past, drag queens have 

been part of a counterculture 
movement that disregards tra-
ditional gender norms and cel-
ebrates individual expression 
and artistic style. However, 
after seeing the popularity of 
Katya’s performance and her 
large and devoted fan base, it is 
evident that drag queens have 
struck a chord in the heart of 
pop culture. Upon entering the 
club, a sea of bodies and loud 
dance music overwhelmed the 
senses. Usually, Necto’s dance 
floor is bustling with move-
ment and dancing, but tonight 
there wasn’t even room to 
breathe. Everyone was jam 
packed and facing the stage 
so that they would not miss a 
beat when their favorite drag 
performer took the stage. And 
when she finally arrived, after 
what felt like hours of anticipa-
tion, she commanded it. When 
Katya entered for her first per-
formance of the night, it was 
apparent that she was born for 
the stage. Wearing her classic 
red and white tracksuit jacket 
with the word “Russia” in big 
letters across her chest and a 
matching gymnastics uniform 
underneath, she took charge 
of the space by performing 
her part of the hit song “Read 
U Wrote U” from “Drag Race.” 
She enthralled the audience 
and created a state of enthusi-

asm with her signature brand of 
acrobatic dance moves. People 
were singing along to the iconic 
lyrics, throwing dollar bills at 
Katya and grooving along with 
their own moves. Drag creates 
an environment of acceptance, 
freedom, self-expression and 
jubilation, which were all pres-
ent that night on the dance 
floor.

After the song was finished 

and all of the dollar bills col-
lected, Katya sprinkled the 
crowd with her dark, twisted 
and witty humor and left the 
audience to boisterous cheers. 
She performed a second act at 
midnight for the brave souls 
who were dedicated enough to 
wait around (which ended up 
being most of the audience), 
creating mostly the same expe-
rience but with a different song 
and a new stylish outfit. If you 
missed out on Katya’s perfor-
mance, do not fret because 
Necto night club is known for 
hosting many past contestants 
of the popular show as often as 
once a month, and have local 
drag queens performing every 
Friday night. Drag is an experi-
ence best seen live, so whether 
you’re a veteran fan or a first 
time viewer, Necto’s doors are 
always open to those who want 
to have a good time and enjoy 
the exciting art.

ELLIS HYMAN

For The Daily

Díaz to speak at Rackham

Writer after writer will tell 

you the same thing: It starts 
with a voice, with the faintest 
suggestion of a character. That 
character comes to inhabit the 
world, the real world, and the 
writer is thrilled, and maybe 
a little frightened, of how 
real that character becomes. 
Writing what it dictates only 
tightens its grasp.

For Junot Díaz, it all started 

with 
Yunior. 

The 
cerebral, 

impulsive 
Dominican 
American 
character 
turned 

up 
over 
20 

years 
ago, 
back 

when the writer 
was 
applying 

to 
graduate 

programs, 
and 

Yunior’s 
voice 

has been central 
to Díaz’s fiction 
ever since. Díaz, who’s been 
on a hectic travel schedule, 
corresponded with the Daily 
via email from Japan before 
his visit to the University of 
Michigan 
this 
Wednesday 

for the Martin Luther King 
Jr. Symposium. The author 
reflected on his work and what 
it’s like to be an artist of color 
in 2017 — and, of course, he 
elaborated on the role Yunior 
has played as a narrator and a 
muse in many of his stories.

“Yunior 
is 
a 
particular 

kind of cat with very specific 
textual, political and cultural 
preferences,” 
Díaz 
wrote. 

This adds life to his fiction, 
peppering 
his 
work 
with 

references and asides that keep 
it current, yet situate it in a 
specific place, time and culture.

Yunior’s darker side — and 

by extension, Diaz’s — showed 
up in “Drown” and its stories 
of alienation and abandonment; 
over a decade later, romance 
and lust grated on Yunior’s 
conscience in “This Is How You 
Lose Her.” Both of these were 
collections of short stories, 
drawing upon Díaz’s immigrant 
childhood in New Jersey and 
his navigation through the U.S. 
educational system.

Yunior is narrator of Diaz’s 

lively, 
dysfunctional 
stories 

of American life — but he isn’t 
always the protagonist. It was 
Yunior’s voice that brought 
another compelling character 

to life: Oscar Wao, subject of 
the 2008 novel “The Brief and 
Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.” 
Díaz 
received 
the 
Pulitzer 

Prize, and handfuls of other 
awards, for this novel; due 
in no small part to the sharp, 
humorous, 
yet 
sometimes 

desolate voice of Yunior as he 
narrates Oscar’s story. As Díaz 
has written his character into 
being over the years, Yunior, it 
seems, really has developed a 
life of his own.

“Yunior was already in place 

from my first book and when 
I started Oscar Wao he really 
dictated a lot of the form. (And 

boy do I mean 
dictated.)” 
Díaz 

wrote.

This not only 

strengthened 
Díaz’s novel, but 
twisted it in new 
and 
unexpected 

ways, 
as 
his 

unreliable 
narrator weaves 
stories of his own 
until the truth is 
as muddled as it 
is in life.

“Yunior dresses the novel in a 

manner th helps to deepen and 
complicate the narrative while 
simultaneously 
obscuring 

his 
narrative 
intentions,” 

Díaz wrote. “His narrative 
elaborations are as much a 
mask as anything.”

For Díaz, this love of the 

unreliable 
narrator, 
of 
the 

complexities and multiplicities 
of any “true” story, lie at the 
heart of his love for fiction 
itself. It is easier, after all, to 
say something of value when 
Yunior can say it himself.

The author may shy from the 

absolute truths of nonfiction 
writing, but these days, he 
delivers truths of different 
sorts — as a long time activist 
for immigrant rights in the U.S. 
and the Dominican Republic, 
and as a writing professor at 
the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. Both of these roles 
draw upon Díaz’s talents, but 
also stretch his attentions, and 
he finds he must throw himself 
into just one pursuit at a time.

“My writing seems to serve 

no one else but itself but with 
community work there always 
seems to be a higher calling, 
civic responsibility and the 
like. I’ve never been able to be 
do both madly at the same time, 
though,” he wrote. “I seem to 
be very monogamous with my 
passions. Either I’m writing 
like crazy or I’m engaged in the 
community like crazy. One or 

the other.”

While Díaz may not feel 

that his fiction contributes to 
society in the same way that 
his activism does, his stories 
of 
Dominican 
American 

immigrant life open up a world 
that wider audiences may never 
otherwise come into contact 
with. It doesn’t change laws or 
elect anyone to office. But all 
the same, Díaz believes that as 
a writer, he has a responsibility 
to 
bring 
an 
alternative 

perspective on American life 
into the national conversation.

“My hope for all artists is 

that they try as hard as they can 
not to reproduce the dangerous 
hegemonic 
narratives 
that 

our society seems so addicted 
to,” Díaz said. “As a country 
we’ve got a lot more work to 
do to bring our canon in line 
with reality and not with the 
artificial fantasies of those who 
use their power to populate the 
culture with their own images.”

Coming-of-age 
immigrant 

narratives like “The Brief and 
Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao” 
are becoming a more standard 
part of the American literary 
landscape. There may still be 
a long way to go, but Díaz is 
optimistic that new voices are 
being heard, new narratives 
being written.

“Clearly there’s a necessary 

and wonderful transformation 
happening in American letters, 
towards greater diversity and 
inclusion, 
a 
transformation 

whose ultimate trajectory we 
can scarcely imagine,” he said. 
“I’m glad to be writing and 
reading in this day and age. The 
future seems so damn bright 
from where I’m standing.”

Zach Nagelvoort organizes book drive to benefit local students

Forty-two days from now, it 

will officially be March — or 
as grade school students know 
it, National Reading Month. All 
across the country, schools are 
dedicating the entire month to 
providing quality reading time 
to students, regardless of the 
school they go to. It’s an annual 
educational tradition.

But for Martin Luther King 

Jr. Education Center Academy 
in Detroit, things will be a little 
different this year.

A 
public 
charter 
school 

located 
37 
miles 
from 
the 

University of Michigan, MLK 
Education Center Academy is an 
institution that caters to around 
400 students in kindergarten 
and up. It’s a school that 
also 
offers 
early 
childhood 

programs, and a school looking 
for 
additional 
resources 
to 

compliment all 400 students’ 
educations — a school that could 
greatly benefit from donated 
books for this year’s National 
Reading Month.

Enter Michigan hockey senior 

goaltender Zach Nagelvoort.

Nagelvoort, with the help of 

his friend Katie Stepnitz, has 
streamlined the organization of 
a book drive put forward by the 
Michigan hockey community 
for 
MLK 
Education 
Center 

Academy. Last year, Stepnitz — 
a first-year teaching assistant 
at the time — asked Nagelvoort 
to read at a school where 
she 
was 
assistant 
teaching. 

Nagelvoort brought along a few 
teammates — senior forwards 
Justin Selman and Cristoval 
‘Boo’ Nieves and current junior 
forward Tony Calderone — and 
casually stepped in to read to 
the children.

Afterwards, Nagelvoort and 

Stepnitz looked to transform 
the one-time experience into a 
regular reading program. But 
it wasn’t as easy as it initially 
seemed.

“We had this idea, ‘Why don’t 

we make this a regular thing?’,” 

Nagelvoort said. “She’s now 
teaching at Logan Elementary 
in Ann Arbor, and we thought — 
we didn’t know at the time — we 
thought, ‘Whatever school she 
goes to, we’ll set up a reading 
program, we’ll come in and 
read.’ We tried 
to start doing 
that and then 
we 
realized 

it 
was 
going 

to be way too 
much work to 
do in one year, 
so what could 
we do to help 
impact a school 
around 
us? 

Let’s do a book 
drive.”

So the search began for a 

school that could genuinely 
benefit 
from 
their 
support. 

Stepnitz reached out to some 
fellow 
student-teaching 

assistants, and the duo was 
ultimately set up with a visit 

to the MLK Education Center 
Academy. And after touring 
the school, meeting with the 
principle and spending time 
with a classroom of students, 
there was no doubt that it was 
the perfect school for the book 

drive. 

While 
the 

administrators 
of 
the 
school 

were 
proud, 

the 
students’ 

enthusiasm really 
sealed the deal for 
Nagelvoort 
and 

Stepnitz. 
They 

began 
planning 

the book drive, 
but 
Nagelvoort 

brought 
it 
to 

another level. He pitched the 
idea to the Michigan hockey 
coaches, 
and 
the 
ensuing 

support from the staff of the 
entire program has now resulted 
in a full-scale book drive.

The book drive will start as 

early as Wednesday, with boxes 
located at Yost Ice Arena and 
the Stephen M. Ross Academic 
Center. Anyone is encouraged 
to drop off books, and while 
new books are appreciated, 
they aren’t required. Nagelvoort 
plans to donate books 
from his childhood, 
and 
hopes 
many 

others will do the 
same.

The 
ultimate 

goal 
is 
to 
collect 

500 donated books 
by February 4th so 
that 
they 
can 
all 

be delivered by the 
start 
of 
National 

Reading Month. But 
Nagelvoort believes 
the Michigan community can do 
even better.

“If we get 500 books, I’m 

going to be thrilled — I think we 
can do more than that, I think 
Michigan can do a lot more 
than that …. The platform that 

we have here at Michigan as 
student athletes, and as students 
in 
general, 
but 
particularly 

as student athletes, I don’t 
think is used nearly enough,” 
Nagelvoort said. “And that’s 
part of my motivation at the end 

of last year, 
when Katie 
reached out 
to me about 
reading, 
I 

was 
like, 

‘That’s 
awesome.’

“I 
have 

tried to get 
as 
involved 

as 
I 
can 

in 
things, 

going out to 

(C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital) 
on 
Thursdays 
and 
working 

with Athletes for Community 
Transformation. But I didn’t 
feel like I was doing enough 
with the platform I had, and 
like I said, here at Michigan, 

athletes are great about doing it, 
but we can never do it enough. 
There’s never a limit. That’s 
kind of what motivated me to 
get out and make this happen.”

The 
amount 
of 
work 

Nagelvoort and Stepnitz have 
put into organizing the book 
drive goes beyond what typical 
college athletes tend to do. In 
addition to schoolwork and 
a Big Ten hockey schedule, 
Nagelvoort has now added a 
new slew of responsibilities to 
his to-do list.

But he doesn’t see it that 

way. Instead of watching NHL 
highlights while relaxing in 
the evenings, he’s organizing 
social 
media 
content 
and 

scheduling with Stepnitz. He 
even sent out an email to other 
student athletes asking for their 
participation, and is looking to 
start a group that will attend 
readings with students once a 
month.

He’s also hoping that this 

experience will make such an 
impression on fellow student 
athletes that they will keep 
the tradition going after he 
graduates.

For fellow goaltender and 

freshman 
Jack 
LaFontaine, 

none of Nagelvoort’s actions in 
the book drive surprised him.

“Honestly, the type of guy 

(Nagelvoort) 
is, 
it 
doesn’t 

surprise me,” LaFontaine said. 
“He’s just a very sympathetic 
young man, and I think he holds 
a lot of integrity. Just doing 
something 
like 
this 
doesn’t 

surprise me at all.

“I don’t know how he does 

it. Between hockey, school and 
now this book drive, it’s pretty 
crazy. But he puts 110 percent 
into everything he does, he’s a 
very passionate guy and I know 
he’s going to do this book drive 
to the fullest of his abilities. 
It’s probably going to be very 
successful, so fingers crossed.”

The book drive will extend 

until 
February 
4th, 
when 

Michigan plays in a two-game 
series against Ohio State at Yost 
Ice Arena.

Senior goaltender Zach Nagelvoort has partnered with MLK Education Center Academy to provide books for children during National Reading Month in March. 

Wolverines off to strong conference start

Five games into Big Ten 

play, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team has lost only 
once — against Ohio State on 
Jan 7. 

The Wolverines are ranked 

third in the conference, with the 
Buckeyes and No. 3 Maryland 
— according to both the AP Poll 
and the USA Today Coaches 
Poll — notching second and 
first, 
respectively. 
Michigan, 

Northwestern 
and 
Michigan 

State have received votes in the 
USA Today Coaches Poll, too. 

Though Michigan (4-1 Big 

Ten, 15-4 overall) isn’t having 
an 
unprecedented 
start 
to 

conference play, it is shaping up 
to be one of the most competitive 
rosters the Wolverines have 
recently seen. Hopes were high 
after last year’s performance, 
but Michigan did not receive a 
bid to the NCAA Tournament 
and instead headed to the WNIT 
for the third season in a row. 

This year, the Wolverines 

are determined to fight their 
way to a — rightful — position 
in the NCAA Tournament, and 
the next stop on the road to 
redemption is an away game at 
Maryland on Thursday. 

“(Maryland’s) 
a 
great 

program,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico after Sunday’s 
win against Minnesota. “One 
of the top programs in the 
country. We’re going to go in 
with nothing to lose. We’ve 
played them in some real tough 
games in the last couple of years. 
I think we have a certain level of 
confidence.” 

But 
even 
without 
an 

upset against Maryland, the 
Wolverines are on their way 
to 
a 
substantial 
season 
if 

powerhouses sophomore center 
Hallie Thome and junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty continue to 
dominate the court. 

Thome and Flaherty have 

been consistent starters, along 
with 
junior 
guard 
Jillian 

Dunston and senior guard Siera 
Thompson. Pushing her way 
into the lineup this season has 
been freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick — who’s been named 
Big Ten Freshman of the Week 
three times — who typically 
trails just Thome and Flaherty 
in points per game. 

The Big Ten season isn’t even 

halfway over, but the conference 
is turning into a battle with few 
wildcards. The Daily breaks down 
the most threatening upcoming 
competition for Michigan. 

No. 3 Maryland (5-0, 17-1)
Terrapin coach Brenda Frese 

recently earned her 50th Big 
Ten victory against Iowa on Jan 
14. It was just her 57th career 
conference game, earning her 
the title of third-fastest coach 
to win that many games in 
conference history.

Adding to the impressive 

team is senior center Brionna 
Jones, who was just named the 
espnW and USBWA National 
Player of the Week —as well as 
being named the Big Ten Player 
of the Week for the third time 
this season. Jones averaged 
33.5 points and 12.5 rebounds 
per game with a .727 field-goal 
percentage and two double-
doubles over the past two games. 

Though 
Maryland 
seems 

slightly invincible, they aren’t 
undefeated 
— 
though 
the 

loss was to No.1 University of 
Connecticut. What the game 
does 
show, 
though, 
is 
the 

Terrapins’ vulnerability once 
their 
shooting 
percentage 

dips. If Michigan can promote 
its presence on defense, the 
Wolverines could pull this one 
out. 

Northwestern (3-2, 14-4)
The Wildcats are grappling 

with the death of one of their 
teammates, Jordan Hankins, 

who passed away a week ago. In 
Northwestern’s first game back 
after the shock, they fought hard 
against Indiana and walked 
away with an emotional 80-67 
win. 

Guard Nia Coffey has notched 

10 double doubles this year 
— second in the Big Ten and 
12th in the nation. Supporting 
Northwestern is guard Ashley 
Dreary who broke the Big Ten 
all-time steals record on Jan. 3 
against Ohio. In total, Dreary 
holds 383 — something the 
Wolverines will need to be 
wary of in their contest with 
the Wildcats at the end of the 
month. 

Michigan State (3-2, 13-5)
Adding 
to 
the 
turbulent 

turn of events for certain Big 
Ten teams, Spartan’s coach 
Suzy Merchant announced on 
Tuesday that she will be taking 
a medical leave of absence after 
Saturday’s game at Rutgers. Her 
symptoms were similar to the 
ones she had on Jan. 1, when she 
collapsed during a home game 
against Illinois. 

The coach’s record is 116-13 

when reaching at least 70 points 
in a game. 

Michigan will have to defend 

against the Spartans reaching 
this marker. Michigan State 
will lead the charge with guard 
Tori Jankoska, who is just 127 
points away from becoming the 
first Spartan player to reach the 
2,000-point mark in program

Michigan can

than that

It’s probably 

going to be very

Massa dominates again 

Maryland’s Josh Ulgade found 

himself on the ground, clutching 
his left knee and desperately 
attempting to catch his breath 
in a match against Michigan 
redshirt freshman Logan Massa.

But against the mercilessness 

of the country’s second-ranked 
wrestler in the 165-pound weight 
class, those recovery attempts 
proved to be futile as Massa 
completed seven takedowns to 
win by a technical fall, 20-5.

It was the 17th consecutive win 

for the Wolverine, continuing his 
undefeated streak for the season 
thus far.

“He just stalks his opponents,” 

said Michigan head coach Joe 
McFarland. “He goes out there 
with the thought that he’s going 
to dominate these guys. You can 
just see how hard he competes 
when he’s out there — I mean 
he wrestles every second. He’s 
constantly 
thinking 
about 

scoring that next point.”

And 
true 
to 
his 
coach’s 

words, Massa completed three 
takedowns in the third period via 
ankle picks, singles and doubles 
to earn five team points for 
Michigan.

“He didn’t want to tie up with 

me. He wanted to wrestle me 
from space,” Massa said. “I knew 
he couldn’t hand fight, and he 
wanted to keep away and get in 
shots from space. So if I could get 

in ties with him, I knew I could 
score from there.”

After the Wolverines forfeited 

the 125-pound class due to 
injuries, 
Massa 
watched 
as 

his team trailed the Terrapins 
heading into the locker room, 
before they took a four-point 
lead heading into his 165-pound 
match — the last of the night. 
With a possible six-points on the 
line, the overall result of the dual 
was still undecided before Massa 
hit the mat.

But 
the 
wrestler 
was 

unaffected by the pressure of 
the meet’s results resting on 
his shoulders. He entered his 
normal routine prior to his 
match, bouncing up and down on 
Michigan’s sideline with a stern 
demeanor and Drake streaming 
through his headphones.

 “I just go out there and wrestle 

every match — I don’t think about 
that,” he said. “Obviously, if you 
need to get the pin, you need to 
get the pin. But that’s what you 
go for every match, so you just go 
out there and wrestle and score 
as many points as possible.”

Coming off a decisive loss to 

Iowa to open 2017, Massa and the 
Wolverines earned a confidence 
boost with its 25-16 victory over 
Maryland before heading to 
Lincoln for a dual against No. 6 
Nebraska.

‘M’ comes back to 
defeat Maryland 

Coming off a 31-7 loss to third-

ranked 
Iowa, 
the 

Michigan 
wrestling 
team bounced back Friday with 
a convincing 25-16 win against 
Maryland at Cliff Keen Arena, 
with the group winning seven 
out of 10 individual matchups.

“We talked all week about 

how we were approaching our 
matches, how we were going to 
compete, and I think for the most 
part, our guys competed hard 
for seven minutes tonight,” said 
Michigan coach Joe McFarland. 
“It was overall a really good team 
effort and it ended up showing in 
the final score.”

Michigan gained a wave of 

momentum early on, taking an 
11-0 lead with a trio of victories 
from juniors Myles Amine and 
Ernest Battaglia and freshman 
Jackson Striggow. However, the 
tide quickly shifted. Freshman 
Dan Perry was pinned in the 
heavyweight 
division, 
and 

freshman Austin Assad forfeited 
the 
125-pound 
match 
when 

he sat out due to injury. At the 
intermission, the Wolverines fell 
to an 11-12 disadvantage.

Coming out of the break, 

freshman Sal Profaci and senior 
Brian Murphy helped push the 
dual meet back in Michigan’s 
favor with a couple of close 
victories in the 141- and 157-
pound divisions, winning 8-4 
and 6-3, respectively.

Locked at a 4-4 tie after the 

first period, Profaci broke the 

draw in the final moments of the 
second period to take a 7-4 lead. 
The freshman added a final point 
in the last stanza.

“I knew if I wrestled my pace,” 

Profaci said. “I was going to be 
able to not only tire him, but just 
get in on his legs. Just giving up 
two takedowns, I knew I wasn’t 
out of it. … I just knew I could 
keep plugging away and tiring 
him out. There’s just more of an 
overall pace and just plugging 
away.

“Nothing 
fancy, 
nothing 

overthinking it. Just getting after 
it.”

Murphy also found himself in 

a closely-contested match, as he 
faced a 3-3 tie in the final period, 
but he went on to score three 
unanswered points to secure the 
win.

“(Murphy) stayed tough,” 

McFarland said. “He’s a solid 
wrestler. I thought he was 
in command of that match for 
the most part, even though 
the score was tight. (Murphy) 
ended up getting the takedown 
at the end, rode him out and put 
it away.”

Michigan held a 20-16 lead 

going into the final match. 
Serving as the team’s closer 
was redshirt freshman Logan 
Massa, who entered the contest 
as the nation’s second-ranked 
165-pound wrestler. He crushed 
any remaining chance of a 
Maryland comeback, winning 
by technical fall, 20-5.

The 
Wolverines 
showed 

promise with the bounce-back 
victory over the Terrapins, 
proving that they can remain 
unfazed even after the sting of 
a tough loss.

Koenig scores ten points too many

MADISON 
— 
Sophomore 

forward Moritz Wagner sat at a 
table in the bowels of the Kohl 
Center. He rested his head on his 
fist, looking off into the distance 
as a question was directed at 
his teammate, senior wing Zak 
Irvin.

Then his shoulders dropped, 

and his head fell to his chest. 
In the simplest sense, he looked 
like a man who had just had 
his heart broken. And in all 
likelihood, there isn’t a much 
better way to describe what he 
was feeling.

Because Tuesday night the 

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

team had its heart broken, and 
it has Wisconsin guard Bronson 
Koenig to blame for it.

There are a lot of “what ifs” that 

could come from both benches 
after Tuesday night’s matchup.

For 
Michigan, 
what 
if 

Wagner and redshirt sophomore 
forward DJ Wilson didn’t pick 
up their third and fourth fouls, 
respectively, within 43 seconds 
of each other and with 12 
minutes still left to play?

For Wisconsin, what if its 

own 
forward 
— 
sophomore 

Ethan Happ — had played more 
than just 12 minutes in the 
second half after getting into 
foul trouble himself?

Though those questions can 

never be answered, it’s fair to 
say with near certainty that if 
Koenig hadn’t done what senior 
leaders are meant to do when 
their team has its back against 
the wall, the Wolverines could 
be heading back to Ann Arbor 
with their best win of the season 
against the 17th-ranked Badgers.

Michigan had led by as much 

as eight before Koenig hit the 
first layup. But little did the 
Wolverines know that one layup 
could open Pandora’s box. The 
first came with 5:51 remaining 
in the game.

Thirty-five 
seconds 
later, 

Koenig took a ball in transition, 
beat his man off the dribble and 
overpowered Michigan to the 
rim for another lay in.

Then Wagner missed a three 

after a Wolverine timeout, and 
Koenig grabbed the rebound 
himself. This time, the Badgers 
used an elevator screen to let 
their senior guard run with 
the hot hand. Koenig obliged, 
pulling up three feet behind the 
arc and burying one from deep.

Then the Kohl Center woke 

up, so much so that senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. needed to 
walk up to his teammates on the 
next possession just to scream 
the play directly in their ear.

Once again, Michigan missed. 

The Badgers came down the 
floor, and Koenig caught the 
ball in an open position in the 
corner. He pulled up, let it fly, 
and as the ball fell through 
the hoop, he gave everyone an 
indication of how this game was 
going to end.

Michigan had led for over 11 

minutes. Koenig turned that 
into a consolation prize for the 
trip to Madison.

That’s what makes this one a 

heartbreaker. Michigan had the 
golden goose in its crosshairs 
when it was never expected to 
have it in the first place.

For all intents and purposes, 

Wisconsin did exactly what was 
expected of them heading into 
Tuesday night. Its blueprint for 
success has always been to play 
through the post — something 
Beilein 
admitted 
Monday. 

And with the way Michigan’s 
big men have been playing, it 
seemed that blueprint would be 
the precursor to a blowout.

Yet 
on 
Tuesday 
night, 

Michgian 
convinced 
viewers 

that they had better stay up until 
the final buzzer. It all started 
on Wisconsin’s first possession. 
The Badgers fed Happ down 
low, and Happ backed down 
Wilson, before pivoting to shoot 
a hook.

Except the result was entirely 

unexpected — Wilson rejected 
Happ 
and 
the 
Wolverines 

claimed possession.

It was just a microcosm of 

a night that was filled with 
deviations from the expected.

And those deviations nearly 

were enough.

But, in the end, Bronson 

Koenig scored 10 points too 
many.

Michigan leaves Madison with close loss

MADISON – Entering Tuesday, 

John Beilein had coached 17 games 
against Wisconsin in his career. He 
had won just two of those contests, 
with each loss adding to the 
mounting frustrations of the last.

“Two games,” Beilein said, 

expressing his frustration. “Two 
great wins, though, those games 
were great, freaking wins. There 
was a whole bunch of close ones. 
...They’re just really good. They’ve 
had better teams than us, and they 
have tremendous coaches.”

With Tuesday’s game knotted 

at 
43 
points, 
junior 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
and redshirt junior guard Duncan 
Robinson each hit 3-pointers on 
back-to-back possessions to extend 
the Michigan lead back to six. The 
Wolverines regained momentum 
after the Badgers erased an eight-
point lead and silenced the rowdy 
Kohl Center crowd.

An away win against a top-25 

conference opponent, a .500 Big 
Ten record and massive résumé-
boosting win were all within reach.

But Wisconsin responded with 

a 15-0 run, led by one of its senior 
leaders, Bronson Koenig, leaving 
Beilein and the Wolverines baffled 
again. The Badgers were able 
to maintain the lead from there 
despite Michigan closing within 
two points, and Beilein once again 
leaves the Kohl Center with a loss, 
68-64.

“Being on the road, we knew. 

Wisconsin being a great team, we 
knew they were going to make a 
run,” said senior guard Zak Irvin. 
“They made a run in the second 
half, and we made ours. We were 
going back and forth. Just late, 
when (Beilein) said they made 
some shots we weren’t able to. They 
(just) got a couple breaks.”

What will bewilder Beilein the 

most following this most recent 
unraveling against the Badgers is 
how the Wolverines got in trouble 
to begin with – by fouling.

“It’s all confusing. Confusing,” 

Beilein said. “We lead the country 

in not fouling. It was confusing 
what happened, so we’ll just let it 
go.”

Michigan 
entered 
Tuesday’s 

contest leading the nation in fewest 
fouls committed per game. With 
14:26 to go in the second half, the 
Wolverines put the Badgers in 
the bonus. Minutes later, redshirt 
sophomore forward DJ Wilson 
and sophomore forward Moritz 
Wagner each picked up their fourth 
fouls, leaving Michigan searching 
for options on the bench.

Without their starting big men, 

the Wolverines couldn’t maintain 
their established lead off the 11-0 
run they had opened the second 
half with.

After shooting 0-for-3 from the 

field in the first half and looking 
visibly frustrated with himself, 
Wagner came out of halftime 
looking like a different player. He 
helped erase a five-point halftime 
deficit, and boosted Michigan’s 
offense after an uncharacteristic 
low-scoring half.

Despite the struggles offensively 

in the first half, the Wolverines 
looked like a completely different 
team defensively in the first 

half compared to their prior five 
conference games. Michigan held 
the Badgers to just 26 points in 
the first half, forcing them into 
shooting 38 percent from the field 
and 22 percent from behind the 
arc.

Wilson and Wagner led that 

defensive effort by making their 
physical presence known down 
low. Wilson blocked two shots in 
the first half, and both were doing 
well to control difficult matchups 
guarding 
two 
of 
Wisconsin’s 

leading scorers – Ethan Happ and 
Nigel Hayes.

“I thought as a group we played 

really well defensively, especially in 
the first half,” Irvin said. “We knew 
in order to put ourselves in position 
to win tonight we had to play well 
defensively and I thought we did 
that.”

But 
that 
aggression 
boiled 

over in the opening minutes of 
the second half. Wilson picked 
up his third and fourth fouls on 
two consecutive possessions with 
12 minutes to go. Wagner played 
victim to his bad habits, picking 
up unnecessary fouls going for 
rebounds, and was benched with 

his fourth foul shortly after Wilson.

“We’ve got to find a way to be 

physical without fouling, especially 
in the second half,” Wagner said. 
“I think there was a four-minute 
battle where we just gave up too 
many easy foul calls in the post and 
rebounds and stuff like that.”

The 
Wolverines 
only 
had 

Irvin to rely on for consistency 
throughout the game. Scoring 20 
points on the night, Irvin made an 
impact early and played a key role 
in Michigan steadying the ship 
after massive Wisconsin runs. 
Irvin scored the Wolverines’ first 
six points, extended Michigan’s 
leads in the second half and came 
up with scores in tight situations 
down the stretch.

But down the stretch, Koenig 

and the Badgers put together the 
most dominant run of the night, 
and that was enough for Wisconsin 
to defend its own court.

Beilein once again leaves 

Madison scratching his head, as 
a win over the Badgers seems as 
elusive as ever despite the game 
being one of the Wolverines’ 
most complete performances of 
the season.

statement

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | JANUARY 18TH, 2017


I don’t like to talk about 

him.

It is December, the last 

month of my first semester 

of college. When people ask 

about him, I say he’s doing 

well. If they want to know 

what happened, I say that his 

life ran out of time for mine 

(bullshit). When they ask if 

I miss him, I say yes, very 

much. My cheeks pull my lips 

into a smile, closed-mouthed, 

and I duck away, in search of a 

solitude seldom found in Ann 

Arbor.

The flashbacks return as 

soon as I find that space. I 

feel the warmth of our first 

few weeks spread through 

me, the revelation that comes 

with finding someone who 

understands 
everything 

about you. It is my last night at 

home. I’m kissing him on his 

porch, and I don’t stop until 

two in the morning because I 

know it will be the last time. 

I feel my eyes burn as my 

mom moves me into my dorm 

the next day. I dry-heave 

on my bed just as I did that 

afternoon, re-experiencing a 

torment too severe for such 

a privileged young girl. I 

am crying now. I go back to 

September, when he tells me 

he’s addicted to a very cruel 

drug. It is over, but I am 

crying, encaged in glass.

My 
phone 
buzzes. 
He’s 

texted me again, asking about 

school. My heart sinks and 

jumps. I say hello, that it’s 

nice to hear from him. I tell 

him classes are great (ha!), 

that I’m making friends (not 

a complete farce) and that 

I’m getting over everything 

that happened in the summer 

(complete farce).

The glass breaks and the 

flashbacks 
bleed 
to 
the 

present in incoherent waves. 

I peck at my screen: Nothing 

is great. I miss your eyes. I 

want to know how your kitten 

is doing. Remember when you 

flew to New York just for me?

When I left for school, 

every conversation became 

an argument. I was walking 

through 
life 
in 
a 
sickly 

state of anger. To him, I 

was irrational, my opinion 

invalid. I didn’t understand, 

he assured me, I’d never 

experienced true hardship. 

He talked down to me. My 

best friend was turning me 

into a lunatic — and a recluse, 

too invested in one person to 

reach out to any of the 40,000 

around me.

But then it came. I think 

we should stop doing this, 

his text read. It was my first 

weekend back home.

I don’t write well enough to 

explain that pain. It’s a burst 

of tears each time he posts 

on Instagram; a borrowed 

shirt I never returned. It’s 

going through photos I took 

when 
he 
wasn’t 
looking, 

just to twist the knife. It’s a 

pair of eyes that I can’t stop 

imagining, knowing they will 

never look at me the same.

I hear his name and I want 

to hide. On that first day in 

Ann Arbor, I examined every 

bump and crack of my dorm’s 

white ceiling in my fit of panic 

— I can’t even look at it now. 

Right now, I’m breathing fast. 

I made my friend stay in the 

room with me to write this.

Memories of him no longer 

seep into my everyday life, 

though I miss what we had 

every once in a while. I feel 

like I’m finally living again, 

catching up on a semester’s 

worth of risk-taking, friend-

making and happiness. At 

least I finally made it. 

I still don’t like to talk 

about him. But now, it’s not 

such a point of weakness. 

I just have more important 

things to say.

The show will not go on for 

Circus, the clubbing complex 

in 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
Old 
West 

Side. After 22 years, the adult 

funhouse is slated to close its 

doors in early February.

Circus has been a staple to 

some and an anomaly for many. 

Though I have lived in Ann 

Arbor for more than a year, 

my first visit to the bar and 

billiards hall was this summer. 

By that point I was well worn 

into my 21 years, and having 

never debated with a bouncer 

over the authenticity of my 

ID, I wasn’t accustomed to 

bars with themes other than 

“we serve alcohol here.” From 

the strangeness of the scene, 

I thought for a moment I had 

wandered 
into 
the 
wrong 

place, or another of the many 

establishments stacked Lego-

like at 210 S. 1st St.

Inspiration for the club pulls 

heavily from the Ringling Bros. 

Circus, another cultural staple 

that coincidentally announced 

this week it would be closing 

the caravan for good. The 

clashing decor can be visually 

disturbing: a smear of bright 

colors 
dimmed 
by 
poor 

lighting, carnival trimmings 

butting up against pool tables 

and big screens playing sport 

channels. There was a worn 

sadness to it, like collagen lips 

or a falsely straightened nose. 

Any character that could be 

derived from the building’s 

165-year 
history 
has 
been 

smoothed over like wrinkles 

after 
Botox 
by 
its 
garish 

artifacts — a place so tacky they 

should be selling keychains by 

the coat check. Circus couldn’t 

make up its mind about what 

it wanted to be, and catered to 

an audience that didn’t want to 

grow up.

I went to the farewell bash 

last week with two friends to 

get a sense of how the campus 

and surrounding community 

would react to the end of the 

Circus era. A surprisingly wide 

range of ages turned out for 

the goodbye soiree, and the 

wardrobes ran the gamut from 

camouflage hats to sombreros, 

formal wear to flannel. With all 

four clubs open and connected, 

it’s impossible to describe the 

scenery 
without 
sounding 

like Stefon from SNL: “Ann 

Arbor’s hottest club has year-

round Halloween decorations, 

elephant heads, boys singing 

Blondie and blondies singing 

Boyz II Men.”

Unlike 
at 
a 
real 
circus, 

here the clowns talk. “Can I 

buy you ladies a shot?” a boy 

asks us. Let’s call him Brady, 

in honor of the Tom Brady 

jersey he was sporting. His 

buddy went to grab the shots 

while Brady spins us two at 

a time. Millennium, another 

of the clubs in the complex, 

is 
decorated 
much 
like 
a 

bowling alley, with Tiffany-

style lampshades over the bar 

and plenty of disco balls. We 

spot Brady later, spinning girls 

like records upstairs in Circus. 

Jerk. Cavern in the basement,

with a faux koi pond, plastic trees and twinkly lights, is an unexpected Eden — an angel bust graces 

the bar, and a distressed “Creation of Adam” fresco provides the perfect backdrop for posterity 

shots. Part speakeasy, part bomb shelter, the edifice of

Cavern reminds me of the underground pubs I frequented last summer in Oxford. We exit the 

veritable Rainforest Cafe, or we try to until the DJ plays a remix of “Who Let the Dogs Out” that 

drags us back by our leashes. In spite of my previous reservations, I am spellbound by Cavern, and 

for the first time feel a pang about the club’s passing. We dance, pose in front of the fresco, then 

push for a change in scenery.

“I love Circus,” the girl in front of me in line says. “It’s just weird. I fucking love it.”

The ability to barhop without ever stepping foot outside was so attractive we maintained a constant 

circuit through Circus, blurring the milieu like the view from a carousel ride: passing funhouse 

mirrors, a serene water fountain, a miniature Statue of Liberty. The drinks were terrible, but they 

had cheap PBR and gloriously free popcorn. Strangers of all creeds and classifications meet, grab 

one another by the shoulders and sing. It’s a scene that isn’t dignified, nor easily duplicated.

Asking why visitors go to Circus is like asking why people drink in the first place — it’s an 

escape, but in a setting that glorifies a history of the fantastical. In 19th-century America, traveling 

performance troupes brought the strange and peculiar to small towns nationwide. Circus and 

Co., inspired by the pioneers of entertainment, provided a similar service to the Ann Arbor area. 

Millennium is a retreat into the ’90s, while Gotham caters a slice of a venerated franchise. There 

was more to this bar than a counter over which alcohol is served. Though it’s low-budget Vegas 

sideshow appeal is not universal, it was effective. It became as real as you wanted it to be.

I had a great time at Circus, watching social constraints melt over showtunes and pool tables. 

It was a spot where — because it was so odd, because it was trying so hard to appeal to so many 

demographics, because it wanted nothing from you besides to show you a good time — coming as you 

are meant never standing out. As I wade back through the crowd, I overhear a man’s voice: “This 

place is kind of nuts!” Well, that’s kind of the point.

Navigating New Policies 
and Old Prejudices

L

SA junior Emily Kaufman jokingly refers to 
herself as a “trans-mama,” a guide of sorts to other 
women at the University who are navigating what 

it means to be a transgender woman on campus.

“When I first came to this University I knew I was a 

woman but I didn’t look like a woman,” Kaufman said. “I 
started transitioning between the fall of ‘14 and winter ’15 
my freshman year. There was only one other trans girl I 
knew about in the entire undergraduate class early on.”

In October 2016, Kaufman gained national attention 

when Cosmopolitan magazine published a profile of her 
 

decision to rush a sorority on campus, under the headline 
“Can Trans Girls Be Sorority Girls?”

Candid and witty during our interview at the State 

Street Espresso Royale, she describes the growth of the 
population of trans women on campus as slow but gradual.

“A few more came in. A few more came out,” Kaufman 

said. 

Gender identity refers to an individual’s internal self-

perceived gender — this self-identification could be male 
or female, but also may fall outside the conventional 
binary. The manner in which people externally present 
their gender — commonly through appearance, dress and 
behavior — is referred to as gender expression.

Those who are born with a biological sex that matches 

their gender identity and expression are categorized 
as cisgender, while transgender generally describes 
those whose biological sex, gender identity and gender 
expression do not align. An estimated 0.6 percent of the 
U.S. adult population identifies as transgender, according 
to a UCLA Law School study.

Her freshman year, Kaufman lived in the Gender 

Inclusive Living Environment, housed in East Quad 
and established in 2013. The housing community 
supports students who identify as transgender or gender-
nonconforming.

In her first semesters on campus, professors would 

frequently mis-identify her as a male — unaware of her 
gender transition — which Kaufman accepted with an air 

of inevitability.

“That’s sort of the way it goes,” she said. “Unless you’re 

blessed with a feminine heart-shaped face and bombed 
with makeup.”

As an active member of the campus LGBTQ community, 

Kaufman hopes to educate peers and faculty on how to 
better understand transgender identity and avoid the 
misunderstandings she finds prevalent on campus.

“The biggest problems that I’ve had at this University 

are with professors... they are for the most part ignorant on 
trans issues,” Kaufman said, citing an incident in which one 
of her professors referred to Caitlin Jenner as transsexual, 
an outdated term many people find overly clinical. “It’s 
not okay that they are teaching people who maybe aren’t 
experienced with trans stuff false information. I am not 
cool with that.”

However, Kaufman acknowledged many many of these 

misunderstandings result not from malice, but a lack of 
information.

 “Expecting everyone to have this knowledge is 

problematic,” Kaufman said. “They don’t have access to 
this knowledge, they don’t know. There’s some things 
you’re not going to find on Google. There are some things 
you can only learn from another trans person.”

For instance, someone may not realize that asking a 

trans person for his or her pre-transition name can be 
offensive and hurtful, she said.

On October 5, 2016 University President Mark Schlissel 

announced the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion initiative, 
aimed at promoting an inclusive and diverse campus 
environment through the implementation of individual 
strategic plans within each of the University’s 19 schools 
and colleges, administrative units, athletics and the health 
system.

Recently, the University’s administration has taken 

steps to assist transgender students amid the rollout of the 

campus-wide Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Plan.

For instance, a newly implemented preferred pronoun 

policy — adopted in October 2016 — allows students to 
choose the pronouns they self-identify with on Wolverine 
Access to avoid misidentification by professors. 

The policy was met with some backlash from some 

segments of the University community. LSA junior Grant 
Strobl, chair of the conservative student group Young 
Americans for Freedom, drew national attention when 
he changed his pronouns on Wolverine Access to “His 
Majesty,” mocking the new policy.

The Spectrum Center, located in the Michigan Union, is 

a resource for members of the LGBTQ campus community. 
Founded in 1970, the center was the first of its kind at an 
American college, and worked to promote policy that would 
bar University discrimination against students based on 
sexual orientation. In 1995, the Center expanded to provide 
resources for transgender students and professionals on 
campus, and it’s since fought to educate and activate the 
University community to promote inclusion and support 
for LBGTQ students. 

Will Sherry, director of the Spectrum Center, said the 

center functions not only to promote and pursue policy 
change, but also to ensure these practices remain in place 
beyond their initial implementation.

The Spectrum Center makes space for LGBTQ student 

leadership, employing students part-time to serve in 
various education and advocacy capacities. The center’s 
student advocacy board — which Kaufman sits on — 
provides training and workshops on inclusivity to different 
student organizations and departments.

“One of the biggest obstacles is always just education, 

lack of information, getting information out to people in 
a way that they can grapple with that if that is something 
that is new for them and that is a big goal of our center,” 
Sherry said. “I don’t think that should be on every person 
who holds that identity (to educate others), and so it’s really 
important to have structures like our center in place.”

Sherry stressed that the most important role of the center 

Transgender 
on Campus:

b y M a r i a R o b i n s -S o m e r v i l l e, D a i l y A r t s W r i t e r

is not simply to introduce new rules — like the preferred 
pronoun policy — but also to fundamentally shift how the 
campus community approaches gender and sexuality.

“(The preferred pronoun policy) was a system, a tool that 

was put into place this semester...it feels new, in that way, 
but the practice is something that we would have expected 
of people before the system was in place,” Sherry said. “I 
have talked to many students who have greatly benefitted 
from being able to assert who they are without having 
multiple conversations and have had their gender respected 
in the classroom in ways that felt really good for them.”

Kinesiology senior Laima Augustaitus said they 

experienced insensitive comments, jokes and dismissive 
language 
from 
professors 
regarding 
their 
gender 

identification, an issue they attribute in part to a lack of 
diversity and dialogue within STEM fields.

They attribute the alienation not as the fault of any 

organization or individual, but of a systemic lack of dialogue 
on gender identity.

There’s ageism there too, Augustaitus suggested: 

“Sometimes people say, my professor’s old, they won’t get 
it.”.

Augustaitis’s academic department is small, which they 

said limits their anonymity.

“I feel like if I do say something I am automatically 

outed to the whole department and it would just get really 
uncomfortable,” Augustaitis said. “If I started insisting 
in my program of 12 people that they use my pronouns, it 
would be followed with: ‘what is that?”

Augustaitus 
additionally 
addressed 
feelings 
of 

isolation they face as a transgender person in a same-sex 
relationship. They described their gender identity as subtle, 
and therefore something that is often overlooked and coped 
with internally.

“I’ve felt sometimes like I can’t go to a meeting for other 

trans or non-binary students because I look the way I do, 
like I shouldn’t be allowed to get upset when my pronouns 
are misused,” Augustaitis said. “I’m sure other people feel 
this way too.”

Overall, they expressed disappointment with the 

University’s resources for transgender students, saying 
they would have liked to have had access to more LBGTQ 
resources and support organizations earlier in their 
academic career. Augustaitis was also skeptical of the 
University’s DEI initiative, suggesting the efforts are more 
cosmetic than substantive, “using people’s identities to 
have them speak and do all this emotional labor, but for 
what?”

However, Augustaitis has found a place beyond campus. 

As a member of the Inter-Cooperative-Council, they found 
an educational community they were comfortable in.

“(ICC) has provided not only resources, but people I 

could engage in conversation with about identity without 
seeming like I was complaining or something that was only 
relevant to me,” they said.

Reena Pang is an LSA Junior in the Residential College 

who came out as trans last year. Living in East Quad has 
provided her with a supportive and open environment, she 
says. Being said, there are still challenges to being a trans 
woman at the University.

Systems in place at the University to accommodate trans 

people, such as gender-inclusive bathrooms and resources 
available through the Spectrum Center and CAPS, were 
also reassuring to her.

Even with the new pronoun policy, Pang said professors 

have misidentified her gender twice already.

“There’s just a feeling of mild anxiety when people 

misgender you, especially when professors are doing 
it,” Reena said, harkening back to the mentions of a 
certain discomfort and power dynamic by Kaufman and 
Augustaitus.

She also discussed the infrastructures in place for helping 

students transition.

 “The University is actually putting out a system through 

UHS where people can actually start hormones because 
they are training and bringing in endocrinologists to 
basically start hormone replacement therapy for people 
who need it,” Pang said.

However, there is only one endocrinologist currently 

at the University Health System, with a long waiting list. 
Additionally UHS is provide blood tests and continuing 
hormones, but not necessarily start the hormone 
replacement therapy. As Will Sherry of the Spectrum 
Center mentioned as a common theme, the resources are 
often there, but the access to them is in many cases, very 
limited.

“As much as I trust students to be able to understand 

things on their own,” Sherry said. “There is a lot of value 
in being able to explore identities and talk about them in 
a class.”

 In saying this she showed hope at least, for the 

University community to learn and grow, even as policies 
limit access to resources individuals need.

ight now, I don’t have a 
name. More accurately, 
I have about five. A few 

are more correct than others, but I’d 
respond to all of them. Rather than a 
“real name,” I might just be in pos-
session of a bunch of labels — some 
of which describe who I used to be, 
while others lay out my plans for the 
future.

Since I came out as a trans woman, 

my legal name doesn’t match the 
name I call myself, which sometimes 
doesn’t match what I hear from 
friends and family, or the one I use in 
class. I juggle my monikers through-
out each day, trying to decide which 
one feels best for each situation.

If I met you for the first time in 

person today — shaking your hand 
and all that — I’d probably say 
“Hey, I’m Adam.” And you prob-
ably wouldn’t think that much of it. 
I basically look like an Adam. I have 
longer hair, maybe, or more feminine 
glasses, but in sweaters and jeans, I 
still look male, and I’m not going to 
fuck up that impression and tell you 
my life story the very first time we 
meet.

Adam is still what my parents call 

me. It was the name on my Christ-
mas presents this year. It’s still what 
some of my friends call me. And, 
given that it’s my legal name, Adam 
is still what I use when I’m on the 
phone with pharmacists or insur-
ance people, trying to figure out 
how to get the prescriptions I need 
to facilitate my transition. I always 

wonder if the people at the other end 
of the line know what the prescrip-
tions are for, what the names of the 
drugs actually mean, and if so, do 
they realize how weird and confus-
ing it is that they still call me Adam? 
But if they are raising their eyebrows 
at the boy’s name next to a request 
for Estradiol, they don’t betray it in 
their voices.

And truth is, I don’t mind Adam all 

that much. It’s a fine, efficient name, 
and I can easily deal with hearing 
it from professors and dentists and 
whomever else. There’s a power in 
your life story and identity, and it’s 
freeing to share it or not share it 
with whomever you wish.

At the same time, I can’t help but 

say I’ve been having more and more 
visceral reactions to being called 
Adam in social settings. I choose not 
to correct anyone, because I’d rather 
they call me the most natural word 
they know rather than force some-
one to do something that doesn’t feel 
right to them. But I’ve started feel-
ing this tightening in my heart, little 
pricks of denial and rebellion in my 
brain when I hear my old name. It’s 
nothing I take personally, but I think 
I still look in the mirror too much 
and see a lie. I feel like I’m show-
ing the world something that I don’t 
want them to see — that nobody 
actually recognizes who I really am. 
My old name reinforces that false 
perception.

The best workaround I’ve found 

so far — the best mix of personal 

expression and privacy — is simply, 
“Theisen.” It’s my last name, pro-
nounced like “Tyson” for reasons 
I’ve never been able to explain, and 
in some circles, it’s turned into this 
cool kind of mononym that I hon-
estly really enjoy. It’s mysterious 
and gender-neutral and it hints at 
the truth without being overly blunt 
about it. It’s clearly temporary, but I 
think it’s a fun and effective way to 
handle the awkward middle ground 
I’m in right now. I look male, but I’m 
not. I feel female, but I’m not quite 
there yet, visually. At least my last 
name is nice and consistent.

When I first knew that I was trans 

— like, not when I was just worried 

about my gender, but when I final-
ly confirmed it to myself that I’m 
a trans woman — a new name was 
an overwhelming choice. I didn’t 
know if I should just feminize my 
name into something like “Adele” 
or “Addison,” but that felt too weird, 
too much like I was just tweaking 
my male life. There were too many 
choices, though, in the wide world of 
names. I needed something I could 
have a personal connection to, some-
thing I thought was cute and would 
say something about me and didn’t 
have any negative associations. I 
looked at hundreds of names and 
tried to picture my future with each 
one, how they would sound coming 
out of my friends’ mouths. It was 
impossible.

I went with Lauren because one 

night I suddenly remembered how, a 

very long time ago, my mom told me 
that’s what she would have named 
me if I had been born cis female. And 
once I said it in my head a few times, 
I realized it was perfect. Like Adam, 
it’s fairly simple, and it also happens 
to be cute and very much me in a 
personal, real way. I like that it’s not 
quite a name that I chose myself, and 
that it seems to hint at an alternate 
version of me, one I’ve often thought 
about — that other universe where 
I’m born female and proceed to live 
my whole, normal life that way.

And so, Lauren has become the 

name I’ve used on job applications, 
the name I’ve given to people once I 
know them well enough to feel safe, 

the name I use to make accounts on 
websites. With my friends, there’s 
the somewhat androgynous nick-
name “Lo,” which I love, and the 
more playful “Lolo,” which always 
makes me smile.

I’ll admit that it still took a little 

while for Lauren to feel like my nat-
ural name when people used it. It’s 
something I’m just starting to get 
conditioned to, and while I’m trying 
to work on my new signature and 
not get overly excited when I hear 
people use it, I’m often still pain-
fully aware of how my name doesn’t 
match my face, or my clothes or my 
voice (God, especially my voice). I’m 
working to fix all that in the time-
frame that’s most comfortable for 
me, but even before that time comes, 
I love my name, and I can’t wait until 
it’s my only one.

“Call Me Lo”

by Lauren Theisen, Daily Arts Writer

ILLUSTRATION BY CLAIRE ABDO


M

y eye problems started about five years 
ago. I remember the moment distinctly, 
actually. It was my sophomore year of 

high school and I was walking into sixth-period biol-
ogy when I noticed something was off with my vision. 
The strangest part then, and for a few years following, 
was not having the vocabulary to explain what I was 
seeing. It was hard to communicate my situation to 
people and doctors when I felt it necessary to follow 
every description with “It’s like that, but not exactly.”

At the time, I asked my mom to imagine the gray, 

grainy static of a TV station. That’s how I best 
described what was going on at the edges of my 
vision. I used the word “buzzing,” a verb that doesn’t 
even make sense in the context of eyesight. It was an 
odd kind of isolation; I knew that something was hap-
pening that wasn’t right, but it was such an unusual 
experience that none of the words I used to explain 
it felt right.

On Nov. 11, 2015, I was diagnosed with retinitis pig-

mentosa. RP is a progressive condition that causes 
retinal degeneration. A brief overview: Those with 
RP experience a loss in vision because the photore-
ceptors in the retina, which are responsible for sight, 
start to die. The symptoms and rate of progression 
differ from person to person, but RP usually starts by 
affecting night vision and peripheral vision, as it has 
for me.

I don’t want to say that the diagnosis was a relief, 

necessarily, but after five years of not being able to 
really understand or share what was going on and see-
ing a doctor who kept telling me that he couldn’t find 
any reason for the symptoms I was describing poorly, 
I started to wonder if I’d somehow tricked myself into 
seeing something that wasn’t there. So getting a diag-
nosis, something I could Google and learn about, a 
name that would connect me to other people dealing 
with the same thing, was, in a lot of ways, a relief. 

Putting a label on something makes it feel heavier, 

more permanent, and that was something that peo-
ple close to me worried about. It made the condition 
more real, absolutely, but that condition had already 
been a reality for me. Making my condition real was 
what I needed to shrug off the nagging doubt that it 
was all in my head, even if I knew, realistically, that 
that was a ridiculous idea.

But there were other feelings at that appointment. 

The doctor who gave me the official diagnosis asked 
me about my major. I told him English, and he told 
me that I might want to come up with a contingen-
cy plan, since careers related to English are pretty 
dependent on, well, being able to see. He also told me 
that I should stop driving — I later found out that it 
wasn’t just that I should stop driving, but that legally 
I had to stop driving in Michigan — and that I would 
probably want to think about living in an urban area 
in the future. That was the first time that I thought 
about how the situation was going to affect my life in 
the years to come. I asked him if I was going to go 
blind, and he didn’t have an answer for me. Since RP 
affects everyone so differently, it was hard for him to 
say what, exactly, was in store. It changes the atmo-
sphere of a room when a doctor tells you that there’s 
no way to rule out blindness being in the future and 
that you may want to adjust accordingly.

The thing about a situation like this is that there’s 

not a lot to do besides go on with your life. I stuck 
with my English major, because I’d already gone 
through the very college crisis of figuring out what 
I cared about enough to spend years studying. And 
because I love English. If the legions of people ask-
ing “But what are you going to do with an English 
major?” weren’t going to get in my way, neither was 
this. The word about my eyes got around, as it does. 
I had people reaching out to tell me I was brave. Or 
strong. I think that’s what people say when someone 
is dealing with something that they don’t understand. 
The sentiment was sincere, kind and appreciated. But 
it was hard to feel brave just continuing on.

I started to feel like a fake, like a trickster who had 

duped family and friends into believing that there was 
something fundamentally admirable about just mov-
ing forward in the face of some doubts and changes. 
Especially when, as far as doubts and changes go, this 
one wasn’t earth-shattering. Of course, this is only my 
experience of RP, a condition that affects every per-
son differently. But for me, I knew that I was doing 
pretty well as far as this situation goes — I still have 
my central vision, all I’m really dealing with is an 
inability to see at night and peripheral vision that 
doesn’t do its job. But that knowledge didn’t stop feel-
ings of fear, confusion or frustration. Those moments 
were accompanied by guilt and the worry that I was 
letting down those people who praised my bravery, as 
if any show of strength would be negated by moments 
of weakness.

Going on with my life isn’t especially noteworthy. 

It just is what it is. But in times of fear or frustra-
tion, the support of the people around me helps me 
to move forward instead of giving in to some alter-
native. I think it’s hard to feel like living my life as 
regularly as possible is out of the ordinary because 
everyone deals with things that others don’t under-
stand. And because the people around me have 

done everything they can to accommodate me and 
make me feel like nothing has changed. My mom 
has always come to my doctor appointments and is 
always at the other end of the phone when I need 
her. My dad drove from Grand Rapids to Ann Arbor 
to go to the appointment where I got my official 
diagnosis, and made a late drive home after I asked 
him to stay for dinner because I wasn’t quite ready to 
see him go yet. My younger brother Zach, relatively 
recently licensed, drives me places when I’m at 
home. Over Thanksgiving break, he was in pajamas 
and settled in at home for the night when I asked 
him to drive me somewhere because I was seriously 
craving chocolate cake, and he obliged. Even when I 
found myself unable to really share what was going 
on, they never let me feel alone, and for that I am so 
grateful. My friends always let me take their arms 
or hands in dark rooms when I’m adjusting and 
struggling to navigate. One of my best friends has, 
on multiple occasions, let people know that I wasn’t 
ignoring their high-fives, I just couldn’t see them. 
It’s the small ways in which those closest to me let 
me know that, while they don’t understand what I’m 
seeing, they’re around anyway for whatever I need.

I visited another hospital this summer with my 

family, a hospital that is doing all kinds of research 
and looking for ways to stop, and even reverse, the 
progression of RP. My parents came with me to 
speak to the doctor who specializes in inherited reti-
nal diseases. My mom asked him if I was going to go 
blind. To this, he replied something to the effect of 
“Not on our watch.” He handed a tissue to my teary 
mother nonchalantly, as if it were all in a day’s work 
to tell parents that their children aren’t facing some 
kind of life sentence. And while this doesn’t change 
that the only course of action is to keep on keeping 
on, it doesn’t hurt to have hope and to know that 
there are people working on the behalf of people like 
me with RP.
