Amendments to civil
rights legislation
face challenges on
both sides of the aisle
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
Among the many points of con-
tention between the two amend-
ments to the state's Elliott-Larsen
Civil Rights Act currently before
the Michigan legislature, a pri-
mary one is the inclusion of gender
identity and expression.
Gender identity is defined as an
individual's psychological sense
of their gender, according to the
Human Rights Campaign. For
transgender people, their gender
identity is different than their bio-
logical sex assigned at birth. Gen-
der expression refers to the way
individuals display their gender
identity.
The first bill, introduced in Sep-
tember by Rep. Sam Singh (D-East
Lansing) and Sen. Rebekah War-
ren (D-Ann Arbor), proposes pro-

tections forsexual orientation, and
gender identity and expression.
Both are not explicitly included
in the current act, which shields
Michigan residents from discrimi-
nation on the basis of religion,
race, color, national origin, age,
sex, height, weight, familial status
and marital status. The bill that
Rep. Frank Foster (R-Petoskey)
introduced last week, on the other
hand, only calls for the inclusion of
sexual orientation.
The Democrat-introduced
amendment would protect, for
example, an employee whose gen-
der identity does not match their
biological sex from getting fired
for identifying as transgender.
State Republicans, most promi-
nently Speaker of the House Jase
Bolger (R-Marshall), have said
the inclusion of gender identity
and expression is unnecessary
because transgender individuals
are already offered protections
under the mandate against sex
discrimination in state and federal
civil rights laws.
Democrats, on the other hand,
have said the amendment is neces-

Women explore
complexity of topic
via interdisciplinary
approaches
By EMMA KINERY
Daily StaffReporter
In an effort to examine gen-
der from a different perspective,
about 50 students attended a
TEDx event on Wednesday titled
"Deconstructing Gender Assump-
tions," organized by What the F, a
feminist magazine on campus.
To gauge varying views of gen-
der, the event took a sweeping
view of sex and gender from a bio-
logical, literary, social and person-
al light. It began with a screening
of Northwestern University Pro-
fessor Alice Dreger's TED talk "Is
Anatomy Destiny?" which intro-
duced the idea that on a biologi-
cal level, males and females are
not very different; instead, gender
is a societal idea. However, this
viewpoint then becomes muddled
when considering intersex indi-

viduals.
TheTED talk was followed by
a reading of Jamaica Kincaid's
short story on gender roles in the
1970stitled "Girl."Itlisted norma-
tive statements that her mother
told her while growing up like
"Always eat your food in such a
way that it won't turn someone
else's stomach" and "This is how
to hem a dress when you see the .
hem coming down and so to pre-
vent yourself from looking like
the slut I know you are so bent on
becoming."
Following the presentations,
audience members talked about
their experiences with gender
acquisition, with the discussion
facilitated by What the F staff.
Gender acquisition is the process
through which children learn
gender.
At one table, LSA senior Bella
Gaeta said when she got a black
belt in martial arts as a girl, her
aunt encouraged her to practice
more feminine activities. LSA
freshman Iris Partlan's response
addressed the contradictions in
that statement.

IDENTITY
From Page 1A
sary for the protections of trans-
gender peoples to be included. In
an interview last week following
the introduction of Foster's bill,
State Rep. Adam Zemke (D-Ann
Arbor), who co-sponsored Singh's
bill, called Bolger's interpretation
of the issue incorrect.
"With all due respect to Speak-
er Bolger, he's mistaken in that
regard," Zemke said. "Discrimi-
nation, as it's enumerated under
Elliott-Larsen, is often handled asa
state's rights issue and that's what
we're seeing here, and that's what
we're trying to push forward."
When it comes to the nuances of
the current legal record on gender
identity and expression protec-
tions, the short answer is that the
Democrats and the GOP are both
right and also both wrong in some
respects.
The long answer is that the
legal status of those protections
is complicated but facing undeni-
able uncertainty for a number of
reasons, according to practicing
employment discrimination law-
yers and experts in the state.
H-M

Employment discrimination
plaintiffs in Michigan have two
options for recourse available to
them: to file in the state's courts
under ELCRA or to file in the fed-
eral court system under either the
1964 Civil Rights Act or both the
Act and ELCRA.
Trial attorney Charlotte Croson
is a partner at the Bingham Farms-
based law firm Bogas, Koncius
& Croson, which focuses on civil
rights litigation.
Croson said there are several
reasons a lawyer and plaintiff
might choose to file in state court
as opposed to federal court when
it comes to employment discrimi-
nation cases, and vice versa. The
process and legal precedentfortwo
court systems differ.
"Michigan discrimination case
law differs in some significant
ways from federal discrimination
case law," Croson said. "It's sort of
a lot to go through, but there are
differences, so it's up to the lawyer
and her client to determine which
venue is appropriate for them to be
in."
Much of the uncertainty that
specifically concernsgender iden-
tity and expression protections
comes from the difference in case
law - a term for legal precedent -
-UM

on the state and federal level.
In 1989, in Price Waterhouse v.
Hopkins, the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that protection against sex
discrimination, as outlined in
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights
Acts, also encompassed the con-
cept of sex stereotyping - dis-
criminating against individuals
because they were perceived to
not conform with traditional ste-
reotypes for their gender. Though
the case did not include a trans-
gender plaintiff, two federal
appeals courts have employed its
precedent in cases that directly
reference gender identity and
expression protections.
One of those courts was
the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals - which includes Michi-
gan in its jurisdiction - when it
ruled in favor of a transgender
plaintiff in 2004 for Smith v. City
of Salem. This means that, as of 10
years ago, it is possible to sue for
transgender protections under
sex discrimination in federal
courts in Michigan, Ohio, Ken-
tucky and Tennessee.
It is also true that, in 2012, the
U.S. Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission found in
the case of Macy v. Holder that
discrimination on the basis of
gender expression or identity is
included in Title VII's protec-
tions against sex discrimination.
The EEOC is the federal agency
charged with enforcing laws
against employment discrimina-
tion, litigating and investigating
on behalf of individuals whose
claims they deem valid.
Broadly, the 2012 decision
means that if the EEOC receives
a claim of discrimination from a
transgender individual, they are
now able to pursue it under the
mandate against sex discrimina-
tion nationwide.

In an e-mail follow-up, Bol-
ger spokesman Ari Adler noted
several legal citations for the
Speaker's position, namely both
the 1989 Hopkins Supreme Court
decision and the 2012 EEOC
Macy decision, along with sev-
eral cases in the Sixth Circuit,
starting with 2004 Smith.
Law Prof. Samuel Bagenstos
said there is set precedent on the
federal level because of cases like
Smith and Macy. He noted, how-
ever, that overall precedent on
the issue is still developing, leav-
ing uncertainty about what may
eventually be determined by a
higher court.
Fewer than 10 district courts
and one appeals court across the
country have also ruled in favor
of including the protections.
That's a small chunk of the
94 district courts and 13 appeals'
courts, which would rule on
the issue. Moreover, the U.S.
Supreme Court has yet to rule on
the issue.
"There is a series of cases that
do this - it is, as I said, a trend
that's moving forward," Bagens-
tos said. "It's not entirely certain
which way the courts are going
to ultimately go on these ques-
tions."
But the most immediate lack
of clarity for Michigan plaintiffs
lies in what that evolving discus-
sion on inclusion at the federal
level means for the state courts,
who currently have no prece-
dent set specifically for offering
gender identity and expression
protections under sex discrimi-
nation.
These are also the rulings that
most directly impact ELCRA, the
act currently being discussed for
amendment by legislators.
While state courts can be
aware of federal precedent, such

as that set in the Sixth Circuit,
they are not obligated to follow
it. Whether the EEOC will repre-
sent a certain group in court also
is not binding to state or federal
precedent.
Trial lawyer Deborah Gordon,
former president of the Labor &
Employment Council of the State
Bar of Michigan, said that, in her
experience, the EEOC is ahead of
the courts when it comes to these
kinds of issues.
"If (Bolger) is talking about an
EEOC advisory, or something the
EEOC has ruled, that and a dollar
will get you a candy bar," Gordon
said, "I mean, the only thing that
matters in court is cases from
judges."
In further explanation of Bolg-
er's position, Adler noted several
state cases that set precedent for
gender stereotyping to be cov-
ered under sex discrimination -
for instance, a man who identifies
as male but does not act "mascu-
line enough" being rejected for
housing. Now, in Michigan, a
case in which that definition is
extended to a transgender person
must occur in order to set prec-
edent that ELCRA applies to gen-
der identity and expression.
This is similar to the path
cases took on the federal level to
set precedent, but Adler acknowl-
edged that no state cases as of yet
have directly concerned trans-
gender plaintiffs.
Bolger is confident that the
state courts would adopt the fed-
eral stance and wasn't concerned
about any uncertainty, Adler con-
firmed.
However, both Croson and
Gordon said the lack of precedent
in state courts does not ensure
success for the transgender plain-
tiffs seeking gender identity and
expression protections.

"In order for (the transgender
plaintiff's) claim to be protected
under Michigan law, Michigan
courts would have to adopt the
same reasoning as the Sixth Cir-
cuit has adopted, which it has not
yet done," Croson said. "Will it
do that? I do not know. So for the
Speaker to assume that sex (dis-
crimination) under Elliott-Lars-
en would have the same meaning
as the case law as it's been devel-
oped in the Sixth Circuit, I think
is a stretch."
Croson noted that Michigan
courts haven't necessarily been
active in declining to adopt the
Sixth Circuit's reasoning; rath-
er, it's not an issue that's been
addressed.
"I've never seen a case on it,"
she said. "They haven't rejected
it, they haven't adopted it. It
hasn't - as far as I can tell, under
Michigan law, it hasn't been an
issue."
Bagenstos said overall, wheth-
er to go through the courts or
to go through the legislature to
add these types of protections is
a question of political and legal
strategy.
However, he said existing
precedent and case law don't
offer the same kind of protec-
tion direct legislative inclusion of
gender identity and expression in
ELCRA would.
"There is a very substantial
legal argument that the sex pro-
hibition discrimination in exist-
ing laws do protect individuals
who are discriminated against
based on their gender identity, but
it's uncertain how the courts will
ultimately rule," he said. "The
only way to be sure to provide
protection to transgender indi-
viduals is to make clear in the law
that the law prohibits discrimina-
tion based on gender identity."

Public Policy senior Laurel
Ruza was approached through
Generation Progress, a D.C.-
based organization that works
with the White House to inspire
social change, to organize the

she invited students from dif-
ferent organizations who were

we're going to help you out,' "
Roquemore said. "By the time
I was coming back to do my
internship, they told me I could
not come in and do the intern-
ship anymore."
She met with administrators
in the School of Social Work
again in July.
"They basically told me that I
was a liability to the campus and
a risk to the campus, and until
this is dismissed, I wasn't going
to be allowed to do my internship
anymore," she said. "Univer-
sity of Michigan School of Social
Work has created unnecessary
hardship for me by getting in
the way of my education. Right
now, you probably wouldn't even
know about this story if they
had just allowed me to finish my
internship. I would've graduated
already and I would already be
working."
In that meeting - which
Roquemore's mother, a gradu-
ate of the School of Social Work,
attended - Roquemore said
administrators told her they
were "standing by some kind of
policy, which they never sent me
in writing."
In a follow-up e-mail sent Oct.
2, Mike Spencer, associate dean
of educational programs,reached
out to Roquemore regarding her
pending case after By Any Means
Necessary - a national coalition
fighting for affirmative action,
immigration rights and general
equality - began advocating on
Roquemore's behalf. The group
speaks on campus frequently
and protested Roquemore's case
outside the School of Social Work
Nov. 12.
"Itwasourunderstandingthat
we agreed that we would pursue
a return to your field placement
once there is a resolution to your
case, which I believe is coming
up very soon," Spencer wrote.
"Our understanding was also
that you wished to return to your
former field placement, but that
you understood that they could
not have you at the agency while
your case was pending. Would
you like to discuss this further
with us? If so, please let me know
and we will schedule a meeting.
I know this is a difficult time for
you and I wish you the best in
your upcoming court case. If you

have any updates, that would be
useful to know."
Roquemore said she felt her
suspension alone was wrong and
that the underlying message of
the e-mail was unfair. She said
the case may take a while to be
resolved in court and her educa-
tion should not be impeded when
the charges against her have not
been proven true.
"It's really an unfair practice
that they're doing," she said. "I'm
innocent until proven guilty. I
haven't even seen a day in court,
and they decided to take my edu-
cation in their own hands and
stop me from completing (it). It's
so unreal right now that this has
happened ... this didn't have to go
this way."
The unspecified policy Roque-
more spoke of may refer to the
Social Work School's Student
Code of Academic and Profes-
sional Conduct as well as its
terms for removal from field
placement.
According to the code of con-
duct, "Generally, unacceptable
professional misconduct refers to
behavior that calls into question
a student's ability or fitness to
practice as a professional social
worker. Students are expected
to adhere to the National Asso-
ciation of Social Workers Code
of Ethics which is hereby incor-
porated under these policies and
procedures and to the policies

tral Student Government.
"It's very purposefully not
affiliated with an organization,"
Abudaram said. "A huge issue like
sexual assault on campus can't
just be addressed by one organi-
zation on campus or one group of
people. We want to address the
issue as holistically as possible."
The students at the round-
tables hoped to work with the
University administration to
enact the changes they discussed.
Ideas included providing con-
sistent sexual assault education
throughout a student's time at the
University, modifying the Stu-
dent Sexual Misconduct Policy to
be more proactive in preventing
incidents and improving training
for residential advisers and Uni-

versity Police.
"You don't realize how pow-
erful you are," said Law student
Nikita Mehta. "We are the Uni-
versity of Michigan, and we're the
ones who can make the changes."
Throughout the week, students
were split into small groups to
share their thoughts, and facilita-
tor presented the group's ideas to
the rest of the participants.
Many of the discussions
focused on the success of first-
year programs like Relationship
Remix, which teaches students
skills related to consent, and the
need to host similar classes for
students of all ages.
"We need to continue sexual
assault prevention education
throughout our college careers,"

Ruza said "There was an overall
consensus that we need to do bet-
ter on that."
Students also hoped the Uni-
versity would enact proactive
policies to prevent sexual assault
on campus, rather than only react
when an incident happens.
"A lot of focus is definitely
trying to get the University to
have a sexual misconduct policy
very much geared towards and
focused on the survivor," Abuda-
ram said. "We want to make sure
there is more of a focus on provid-
ing as many resources as possible
to the survivor and making sure
that survivors know what those
resources are, as well as just mak-
ingsure thatinthe endyouendup
with justice."


and procedures of the student's
fieldwork site."
One of the "major offenses"
listed as a violation of this code
is "criminal activity." The term
does not specify whether "activ-
ity" refers pending cases or
charges, decided court cases or
both.
Furthermore, the policy for
removing a student from field
placement appears to be some-
what discretionary. The policy
reads, "The Field Faculty has
ultimate responsibility for
decisions related to the stu-
dent's placement. At any point
in the field placement, the field
instructor or Field Faculty can
request immediate removal of
the student from the fieldwork
site ... should they deem that
continuing the student seri-
ously places at risk the quality
of the services delivered to cli-
ents and/or the reputation of the
fieldwork site."
Roquemore added that she
felt the actions taken by the
Social Work School constituted
institutionalized racism. Tout-
ing this alleged injustice, mem-
bers of BAMN gathered outside
the school Nov. 12 to protest
what they said was Roquemore's
wrongful suspension from field
work.
The group, along with Roque-
more herself, carried signs and
chanted a number of slogans,
including, "This racist school has
got to pay, Ta-Kara has shown
the way." Some signs compared
her case to that of former MVichi-
gan kicker Brendan Gibbons,
who was also a Social Work
student, seeking to parallel the
treatment of a white student
accused of sexual assault to her
situation and asking whether
both students were evaluated by
the same standards.
Elizabeth H. Voshel, associate
clinical professor of social work
and director of field instruction,
said in a phone interview that she
could not comment on Roque-
more's case, adding that "We (at
the School of Social Work) immi-
nently strive to help all our stu-
dents be successful."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said he was aware of
Wednesday's protest but, like
Voshel, could not comment on
"an individual situation," nor
could he speak to the meetings
that Roquemore said she had
with administrators from the
Social Work School.
Fitzgerald did, however, con-
firm in an e-mail thatRoquemore
is still an "active U-M graduate
student," adding that "the staff at
Social Work very much want to
work with her."
Roquemore's pending case
pertains to an incident the night
before Thanksgiving of last year.
Roquemore was at her mother's
Ypsilanti home with a friend,
Dalia Kenbar, when a social
worker from Children's Protec-
tive Services and a couple of
police officers knocked on the
door.
The social worker, Roquemore
said, had an ex parte, a court
order that allows for government
officials to take custody of a child
if a judge is shown that "serious
harm will occur if an order is not

entered before the other party
has the opportunity to respond,"
according to the Michigan legis-
lature's website.
Roquemore said she was
reluctant to let the worker and
accompanying police officers
into the house, because the ex
parte order was written for Ken-
bar's address, not Roquemore's
mother's house. Regardless,
Roquemore said, she was confi-
dent that her friend's child was
not in imminent danger. She
said the police then forced them-
selves into her mother's home,
and she claims the police aggres-
sively pushed her around before

ultimately taking her friend's
child.
Bob Wheaton, acting manager
of communications for the state's
Department of Human Services,
said in an e-mail interview that
CPS does, at times, remove chil-
dren from a home other than the
parent's home: "If we didn't do
that, parents could avoid court
orders."
This can be done only after
CPS "substantiates abuse or
neglect," he said, finding that
"removal is the best course of
action." At this point, only once
the local court grants a petition
to do so can action be carried out.
Wheaton added that he could
not speculate about the applica-
tion of these rules to the case of
Roquemore's friend.
Roquemore also noted that
CPS had taken away one of her
friend's children before, but said
Kenbar's circumstances were
quite different in the previous
case.
"The police feellike I obstruct-
ed justice that nightcby getting in
the way of the door (and) telling
them that they weren't going to
take my friend's baby," she said.
"I wanted to protect my friend's
baby. They had no real basis for
being there that night."
Although she was arrested,
Roquemore said, she was not
charged at the time. Days later,
on Dec. 2, Detroit's ABC affili-
ate broadcasted a story about
the incident. In the segment,
Kenbar's attorney said CPS
failed to investigate and evaluate
Kenbar's living situation before
seizing custody of her infant.
Furthermore, the CPS investi-
gator said in court that nothing
appeared to be wrong with the
home when Kenbar's child was
taken.
Only six months after the
fact, Roquemore said, did police
charge her with obstruction
of justice and resisting arrest,
which sparked the suspension of
her field work and has led to sub-
sequent outcry from Roquemore
and BAMN.
Jose Alvarenga, a BAMN
national organizer who helped
organize the Nov. 12 protest, said
the organization became aware
of Roquemore's story at a BAMN
tribunal session held last semes-
ter to address racism on campus.
"It's not justified at all to con-
demn her as a criminal before
she even had a single day in court
to present her case," Alvaren-
ga said. "(The School of Social
Work) is doing to her the com-
plete opposite of what a school
that stands for social justice
should be doing."
In addition to mobilizing the
protest, Alvarenga and other
local members of BAMN encour-
aged students to "pack the court-
room" to support Roquemore at
her first hearing Nov. 18, which
took place in the Washtenaw
County Courthouse at 415 W.
Michigan Ave. in Ypsilanti.
There, one of BAMN's lawyers,
Shanta Driver, represented
Roquemore.
Roquemore also said Driver
will represent her if the Univer-
sity does not allow her to com-
plete her internship, although
she did not provide a timeline

for this potential litigation. Kate
Stenvig, another BAMN national
organizer who said she works
closely with Driver, echoed this
statement.
"She should've graduated
already ... (the University is) say-
ing, 'Oh we're willing to work
with you,' but they're sending
those e-mails to calm down
the situation and make it seem
like they're offering her back
her internship," Stenzig said.
"But they're not, they're saying,
'We're not going to work with
you on this until all your court
hearings are over.' That's the
problem."

From Page 1A
"It's interesting in that exam-
ple that that sort of thing isn't
feminine, but yet as you get older
women are expected to know self-
defense," Partlan said.
All of the attendees at the table
pointed to middle school as a time
in their lives when they felt that
they had to conform to traditional
female standards of beauty and
practice.
"I hate pink, I've always hated
pink, and for some reason in mid-
dle school I wore pink," said Pub-
lic Policy junior Becca Manery. "I
straightened my hair, and it was
justthingsthatIhaven'tdonesince
then and didn't do before then."
"Everyone is going through
some big changes, and everyone's
so sensitive to how everyone else
perceives them, and I feel like it
was a time when even if people
weren't saying anything to me, I
was perceiving what other people
were doing and I was copying
them."
Attendees described how in
elementary school the competi-
tion they experienced was often
between boys and girls to prove
their superiority over the other
gender. But after middle school,
the girls saidthat they feltthe most
competition with other girls. Sev-
eral discussed the name-calling
and shamingthat occurred in their
high schools.
"We're all products of our social
environments," said alum Col-
leen Smythe, addressing her high
school experience. "Just the idea
that you pick this 'right' way to be
a woman and shame everyone else
who supposedly isn't that."
Other women described an
internal struggle between doing
stereotypically feminine things,
such as wearing makeup and dress-
ing up, while still being against
objectification.
Several attendees also noted
feeling that they need to look good
for boys while maintaining femi-
nist ideals. A fundamental question
of the discussion was whether they
were spending time on make-up
and outfits because they wanted
to or because they felt it was a
requirement.
"Are they doing it because of
gender norms or are they doing it
becausethey wantto?" Maner said.
"They should be able to do what
they want to do, and I shouldn't
have any power in judging them
for it, whatever their motive is, but
it's hard to distinguish even for
myself."

Seto said Michigan State Police
will conduct an investigation to
look into the issue further.

Atthe Ann Arbor City Council
meeting Monday, councilmem-
bers discussed how to improve
the transparency after alterca-
tions and encounters between
police officers and citizens.
Councilmember Sumi Kaila-
sapathy (D-Ward 1), the coun-
cil liaison to the city's Human
Rights Commission, expressed
the Commission's concerns to
the Council Monday night.
"While they are patient about
waiting to hear what the Michi-
gan State Police has in terms
of collecting additional infor-
mation, they do want a policy
discussion and evaluation," Kai-
lasapathy said.
Councilmember Jack Eaton
(D-Ward 4) said he supported
the Human Rights Commission's
take on the issue and for Coun-
cil to review police procedures.
The Human Rights Commis-
sion was established in 1957 to
oversee civil and human rights

for Ann Arbor citizens. The nine
members of the commission are
elected by the Council.
"We need to use this incident
as a reason to review our poli-
cies," Eaton said.
According to Ann Arbor
Mayor Christopher Taylor, after
the Michigan State Police estab-
lishes the facts, the case will go
to the Washtenaw County Pros-
ecutor's officetobe"reviewed,
which is the standard procedure
for a police shooting.
"It ensures that the deceased,
the officers and the community
have a painstaking, independent
and professional consideration
of the events," Taylor said.
In response to several public
comments regarding the shoot-
ing, Taylor thanked the public
Monday night for its commit-
ment to finding out the details of
the shooting.
"Ann Arborites are commit-
ted to seeing a fair and thorough
investigation completed," Taylor
said.
Councilmember Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) said he
would like to see the results of
the investigation before the pub-
lic passes judgment on the inci-
dent, though he recognizes the
public's interest in them.
"I, as an elected official, will
not kowtow to those kind of
demands that treat our police
officers as if they did something
wrong first," Kunselman said.

Athletics over academics
The 'U' must maintain student-athlete academic integrity
espite increasing skepticism from the general public,
the NCAA claims to hold "the pursuit of excellence
in both academics and athletics" as a core value of its
institution. The NCAA prides itself on being an organization with
the students' best interests in mind above all else. Although the
NCAA generates massive amounts of revenue each year - in 2013
it generated a total revenue of $913 million - it still classifies itself
as a nonprofit organization with a commitment to academics.

in love with the game. Tradition
has been built at Michigan because
it's fun to go to games and cheer on
our team. Sports are fun. Football
at the Big House is fun. So on
Saturday, bundle up, scream until
you lose your voice, take advantage
of the deals that we'll get (it's fan
appreciation day on Saturday!)
and enjoy the day with a stadium
with your friends, family and
fellow Wolverines.
Let's make Saturday about
the football team, especially the
seniors. Earlier this semester, FSAC
members had the opportunity to

meet with the football team leader-
ship group. They voiced to us loud
and clear that the student section
matters to them. The first place
they look after touching the ban-
ner is the student section. They
notice how full it is when they run
out of the tunnel, and they hear and
respond to our cheers throughout
the game. We make a difference.
So, let's do our part and support
our boys in blue this Saturday. Let's
get to the game early to watch our
seniors honored and to cheer on our
team as they run out of the tunnel.
Let's stay for the whole game, sup-

port our team and be active partici-
pants in the victory over Maryland.
We can make Saturday count.
Our team needs one more win to be
eligible for a post-season bid, and
as students, we can do our part by
cheering our team on to a victory at
home for the last time this season.
As students, we are Michigan
and our presence at games makes a
difference. As FSAC, we're bringing
our best to Saturday. Will you?

Advisory Committee.

Ninety percent of the money brought in
comes predominantly from the Division I
men'sbasketballMarchMadnesstournament,
through television marketing and ticket
sales. Of the revenue generated by the NCAA,
nearly 60 percent is directly distributed
to Division I programs, with $120 million
going towards grants-in-aid and $60 million
in funding for student assistance. By paying
the athletes' tuition, the NCAA appears to be
giving the athletes an education; however,
in reality it is buying the organization the
workers it needs at a discount price and does
not give the student-athletes the benefits they
would receive if they were employees, such as
overtime and promise of safety.
Forbes magazine reported that "The typical
Division I college football player devotes 43.3
hours per week to his sport - 3.3 more hours
than the typical American work week." The
NCAA restricts weekly athletic activities to
taking up no more than 20 hours, but because
this rule is not enforced, colleges do what
they can to take their athletic programs to the
next level. Most other colleges follow suit to
remain competitive, even though the safety
and academics of their student-athletes are
put at risk.
The schedules created by the NCAA suggest
a tacit disregard for student-athlete education.
It has been estimated that the students on
teams that make it to the Final Four miss a 24.2
percent of the semester's classes, and that is
for the tournament alone. The NCAA may give
the athletes an opportunity for an education,
but if they are only learning a fraction of what
other students learn, exactly how much is an
athlete's education worth? On the first day
of winter semester last year, the University's
men's basketball team was in Nebraska. This
caused them to miss the first day of class,
without significant ramifications. This comes
while non-athlete students risk losing their seat
should they miss the first day.
The apparent emphasis on athletics over
academics in the nation's universities has
become clear in recent years. In 2008, a
controversy arose at the University around
retired Psychology Prof. John Hagen, who
was accused of assisting student-athletes
in maintaining eligibility by teaching
independent study courses that were well
below University standards of academic rigor.
In Hagen's courses, the student-athletes had
an average GPA of 3.62, whereas their average
in other classes was a 2.57. Some students
were found to have spent only 15 minutes
with Hagen every two weeks, but earned up
to four credits for the class. Hagen taught 294
independent studies courses from Fall 2004
to Fall 2007, 251 of which were to student-
athletes. After months of investigation, the
allegations were dropped, but universities
across the nation were left wondering
about the academic rigor and standard
of student-athletes.
Last March, attention was drawn to the

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
when athletes received relatively high marks
in regular, introductory classes. Paragraph-
long final papers were given an A- on more
than one occasion. An interview later
discovered that athletes were encouraged
to sign up for "paper classes," classes with
little work; later, they were guided into
"easy" majors. Many student-athletes were
not capable of keeping up with college
academics. A UNC study showed 60 percent
of football and basketball players at their
school read between a fourth and eighth
grade reading level. It's not acceptable for
universities to allow these students into
an academic world for which they are not
ready. This responsibility falls first to the
NCAA to make sure that universities are
compliant with the academic standards in
admissions and throughout the college career
of student-athletes.
For an organization that prides itself on
putting academics first, even the money the
NCAA gives to students is focused solely
on what the player can contribute to the
team, not what they can contribute to the
classroom. Most athletic scholarships are
granted for one academic year at a time,
and they are available to be renewed except
in cases of extreme injury that prohibit the
student's athletic performance from meeting
expectations. If education and player safety
are the goals of the NCAA, then they wouldn't
tie student-athletes' education directly to
what they can give the athletic department,
and thus, what they can give the NCAA.
Universities will not change by themselves,
and are stuck in this position the NCAA has put
them in - with no room to act againstcthe harsh
conditions for fear ofnotremainingcompetitive
with other schools. In order to keep up with
otherschools, universitieswill continue to push
student-athletes as much as they can. Rules like
academic standards and athletic boundaries
were set for good reason, and only the NCAA
can enforce them. It needs to take that first
step. The NCAA needs to enforce the rules to
protect not only the education of our student-
first student-athletes, but also the integrity of
our traditions.
In a 2008 Michigan Daily interview, Bruce
Madej, then University Athletic Department
spokesman, said "Compliance has a big
stake in each and every part of the Athletic
Department. They look at academics as much
as travel expenses and recruiting and all
other aspects." This is precisely the problem.
When our students' bus rides become as
important as their educations, the system
is flawed and in dire need of a change. The
NCAA and universities are responsible for
their athletes' educations, and must provide
ways to make sure student-athletes aren't left
behind. Student-athletes should be given the
chance to succeed and get the most from their
college education, while engaging in their
respective sports.

hile the front seats of
my decrepit, immobile
Pontiac Grand Prix
often provided
a venue for deep
discussion,
particular bits
of conversations ,
lately resurfaced
in my mind.
Within the car's
rust-encrusted
confines,two dear
friends divulged MELISSA
secrets, expressed SCHOLKE
future hopes and
formed promises.
The tall, good-natured shadow in the
passenger seat frequently assured
his anxious counterpart her worth
and her academic ability weren't
intertwined. He promised she could
trust the decisions she was making
- even if they contradicted others'
expectations. He fervently suggested
she cease fearing her own intuition.
Likewise, the small shadow sitting
cross-legged in the driver's seat
lookedback at her friend and assured
him the whispered judgments of
close-minded people were worthless.
Supportive,. tolerant individuals -
the soft-spoken shadow swore to him
- aren't a rarity in the world. She
promised him once he left their little
hometown - where archaic notions,
indifference and homophobia
were as frequent as the snowfall -
everything would improve. She, with
teary eyes, promised him minds and
society were about to change.
Of all the promises I've made,
that particular statement is one I,
regretfully, find myself continually
questioning. The words - in for-
mation - arise with full, idealistic
conviction. Yet each time, the syl-
lables wedgethemselves in my throat
before their shaky utterance. My
words are well-intentioned when
I try to offer support to my family
and friends who identify as LGBTQ,
but I know my attempts to empa-
thize with my loved ones will never
allow me to fully understand their
struggles. Nor will my optimistic
statements remedy the injustice
they face. Likewise, I know they
deserve far more than reassurance

mpty romzi
and promises - especially the empty
ones they've been receiving from
Michigan's government.'
A tumultuous legal battle - span-
ning a mere matter of months - both
ignited and diminished the hopes of
the LGBTQ community and its allies.
At first, over 300 same-sex couples
were granted the long-overdue right
to legally marry, but state Attorney
General Bill Schuette quickly halted
progress by issuing a stay - restrain-
ing any further marriages and
forcing the Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals to assume jurisdiction of the
case. Schuette's appeal'initiated the
beginning of a tenuous and unneces-
sary waiting game. An answer - in
the form of a 2-1 ruling by the Sixth
Circuit - was received earlier this
month. However, this decision com-
pletelyunraveled the miniscule steps
taken by the state to ensure equal-
ity for all citi-
zens. Although-
the two judges Until same-s
who decided to
reinstitute the is legalized -
ban stated "the doubt - laws
question is not
whether Ameri- to dictate v
can law will individual ca
allow gay cou-
ples to marry; it the life th,
is how and when
that will hap-
pen," Schuette on Nov. 14 further
demonstrated unwillingness to let
same-sex marriage occur by declar-
ing the marriages performed in
March no longer exist.
By issuing a filing stating: "From
a legal standpoint, because the mar-
riages rested solely on the district
court's erroneous decision, which
has now been reversed, it is as if
the marriages never existed and
the Plaintiff's request for benefits
attendant to a legal marriage must
be denied," Schuette retracted the
promise frequently echoed over the
past few months by Snyder where
he reaffirmed the legality of these
marriages. Now with only the rem-
nants of a former promise to hold
onto, LGBTQ couples are forced
to wait for action from the U.S.
Supreme Court..
Even in the realm of preventing

if

discrimination, the potential for
progress has met possible hindrAnc-
es. Currently, Michigan's main anti-
discrimination law doesn't offer
any protections for LGBTQ citi-
zens, but the proposed amendment

Ignace) would only offer protection
to a subset of its intended commu-
nity. The amendment - while it
does include protections for sexual
orientation - doesn't include any
mentions of "gender identity and
expression" in the language of the
legislation. Likewise, a possible
impediment to the overall goals of
the amendment is found in pairing
this piece of legislation with anoth-
er proposal - known as the Michi-
gan Religious Freedom Restoration
Act - that would allow for "broad
exemptions to federal laws if they
conflict with an individual's reli-
gious beliefs."
Currently, the
ex marriage University and
select cities offer

but legislators
ey desire. cannot expect
members of the
LGBTQ commu-
nity to confine themselves to a single
city or move out of state if they want
to possess rights they're wrongfully
denied in Michigan. Regretfully,
this is an option my friends and
family members have considered
for the future. Even if proper anti-
discrimination laws are eventu-
ally passed, it would only partially
eliminate discrimination. Until
same-sex marriage is legalized -
without a doubt - laws will contin-
ue to dictate whether an individual
can freely lead the life they desire.
Michigan's leaders must stop try-
ing to placate citizens by insinuat-
ing they'll eventually receive basic
human rights. Our friends and
family deserve action, not more
empty promises.

FOOTBALL STUDENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE I
Make Saturday count

To Our Fellow Wolverines:
Throughout the semester, between study-
ing for our exams, enjoying boneless Thursday
deals at Buffalo Wild Wings and cheering on the
football team, a group of 22 students, all foot-
ball season-ticket holders, have met regularly
with the UniversityAthletic Department. With
four representatives from each class, includ-
ing graduate students and two members of the
Central Student Government, the Football Stu-
dent Advisory Council has served as a candid
voice to the Athletic Department regarding stu-
dents' experiences at football games.
We've helped make changes to how
students experience game days. Our feedback
played arole in loweringfootball season ticket
prices and the free water at the Penn State
game was our doing. We've also contributed
to the discount on hot dogs available through
the H.A.IL. app, because who doesn't love
discounted hot dogs?
Hotdors,cheaper tickets and free waterjust
skim the surface of the list of improvements

that FSAC has contributed to, andthough they
may make for a more positive student expe-
rience, the Athletic Department's policies
should not influence our student section game
day environment.
Our attitude determines whether or not
we enjoy game day. As a student body, our
attitude toward this upcoming football game
is important. Saturday marks the last home
game of the season, the last time we will
walk through those hallowed gates into our
house this year, and our attitude will dictate
our experience of the game. So, let's choose
to put aside our critiques and complaints
and make the matchup between Michigan
and Maryland the best home football game
atmosphere yet.
Let's make Saturday fun. The rich tradition
surrounding Michigan football far surpasses
any other collegiate football program, and
that tradition includes having fun. Players
spend hours every week at practice preparing
for Saturdays because at some point they fell

HAPPY THANKSGIVING: From the Daily
By Brad Whipple, Weekend Roundup Editor I Photo by Brad Whipple

F orgetthecold and forget
the stress, because only
on thing matters:
It's the most wonderful
time of the year.
Whether or not Andy
Williams is the one to tell you,
it's the truth. It's the holiday
season and that means turkey,
eggnog and family.
For those who didn't make
it home for Fall Break, like
myself, this is the moment
we've all been waiting for.
Soon we'll be in the comfort of
our own homes, warming up
beside the fire with the pets
that we've missed for so long
and promising never to leave
(if only that were true).
Home-cooked meals
are being prepared as you
watch "A Charlie Brown
Thanksgiving," and the snow
will slowly fall outside. The
punch line: you don't have
any classes to walk to. There's
finally an excuse to relax and
play on your Nintendo, read
a book or catch a late-night
movie.
In my house, it is a tradition
every year that my family sees
a movie together after dinner.
This year's pick: "The Hunger
Games: Mockingjay - Part I."

good things in life. Oddly
enough, it's this underlying
meaning that brought about
the holiday in the first place,
when the pilgrims put on a
feast after a successful harvest
in Plymouth nearly 400 years
ago.
Be thankful for the joys in
life, because others may not
have the same benefit. Don't
take what is given to you for
granted, especially the meal
you will share with your
family a week from now.
If you're worried about
coming back to reality when
the holiday is over, don't fret.
Only 10 more days of class plus
some finals, and we're back at
home for Winter Break.
When the time comes, I'll
be sitting under a tree full of
light and decorations, playing
with my puppies while
admiring the voice of Karen
Carpenter.
But even if there are 28 days
standing between now and
the end of the semester, one
thing is for certain: I didn't lie
to you.
It is indeed the most
wonderful time of the year,
and that is something to be
thankful for.

to do on the
UI[ last game day

By EMILIE PLESSET
WeekendRoundupEditor
There's snow on the ground
and that means one thing:
winter is coming.
However, before we
embrace the frigid weather
that we as Wolverines have
come to know and tolerate,
we still have one last game
day to celebrate.
Whether it's your last game
day as a student, or your last
game day of freshman year,
this is the time to rally and
embrace your Wolverine
pride.
So while you're bundled up
under multiple layers of maize
and blue spirit, here are some
things you must do during the
last game day of the season. If
you don't, you'll have to wait
another year.

DANCE ON A LEDGE
This is fun. I don't know
how you could go through
a football Saturday without
dancing on some kind of ele-
vated surface. Embrace this
last weekend of football tail-
gating and have fun with your
friends. Jump on a ledge and
forget about your impending
finals. Make sure you take a
picture while you're up there.
EAT . PIZZA WITH
FRIENDS
While I love pizza always,
there's something about gorg-
ing yourself on melted cheese
and bread after a long day
(morning) of tailgating. It's
almost tradition at this point
that my friends and I get Bell's
Pizza for lunch every game
day. In that moment when I'm

stuffing my face with pizza,
I've literally tasted nothing
better. Stopping for pizza is a
great opportunity to recharge
with your friends before
cheering on the Wolverines in
the Big House.
GO TO THE GAME
I know it's cold. I am
extremely aware that it is
cold. However, there are a
limited number of games to
cheer on the team, the team,
the team. This is your last
opportunity until next year
(or ever if you're graduating).
I know watching the game
from your television while
sipping hot chocolate sounds
tempting, but nothing beats
the rousing atmosphere of the
Big House. Besides, this is a
perfect opportunity to make
use of the maize and blue

Weekend Roundup Contributor
Just when you think you
have worked off all the
Halloween candy, the real
holiday feasting begins.
Whether you are trying to
look great in that New Year's
dress, impress your friends
you haven't seen since
summer or just prove to your
parents you didn't gain the
freshman 15, everyone has
a reason to want to stay in
shape over the next couple of
months.
The cold weather of
November and December
makes everyone want to
nuzzle into pajamas and
a snuggie. Working out
becomes even more of a
chore than it already was
but it is possible, through the
freezing temperatures and
warm stuffing, to get some
exercise in.
WORKOUT INDOORS
If you are like me and
running in nice weather
is unthinkable, doing it in
negative degrees is pretty
much impossible. But there

are tons of ways to
work out indoors that aren't
running on a treadmill at the
CCRB.
Try ayoga class or a fitness
class like Title Boxing.
To avoid venturing out of
your house into the cold,
download a workout video
and do a workout right in
your room. Insanity or P90X
can get your blood pumping
within 10 feet of your bed.
TRY A BIT OF
EVERYTHING
While most of us like to
think that if we work out we
can eat whatever we want,
that isn't how our bodies
work. Weight loss begins
in the kitchen, where you
need to decide what to not
delight yourself with. So
even though it's the holidays,
consider portion sizes when
allowing yourself a treat
every now and then. There
are so many good side dishes
during the holidays and it's
easy to eat everything...
but don't! Have a taste of
everything, but just a small
spoonful. You won't feel
like you missed out, and you

won't feel like you overate
either.
DON'T BINGE IT
I'll admit it, on
Thanksgiving I usually don't
eat anything all day until my
mom serves the turkey, but
this isn't the best way to keep
your eating in check over
the holidays. If you starve
yourself all day you are more
likely to overeat during the
big meals.
Eat breakfast, lunch and
snacks throughout the day
like you would normally
so that when the fancy
dinner comes, you will don't
overeat, but get enough to
keep you full for quite some
time.
USE EXERCISE AS AN
EXCUSE
Need to get away from
your mom's prying questions
about school and your major?
How about your grandma's
insistence that "you should
meet a nice boy/girl"? Use
a trip to the gym to escape
your relatives for a few hours
this holiday season. Your
mental health and your new
toned body will thank you.

Freshmen development slow, steady

FOOTBALL
Wile, Hagerup make
major improvements

By LEV FACHER
Daily Sports Editor
John Beilein knows what
it's like to run a group of
inexperienced freshmenthrough
a gauntlet of training, drills
and offensive sets in preseason
practice, and he knows what
it looks like when everything
comes together.
This year might be different,
though, as Beilein is dealing
with six true freshmen, a
redshirt freshman and a transfer.
Installing Michigan's offense
with such a large contingent of
newcomers is a process, and it's
not going as quickly as it has in
years past.
"They're sometimes perfect
with what they do, and maybe
they miss the shot or the ball slips
out of their hands," Beilein said.
"There are other times they're on
tape delay."
Though Beilein is confident
the results will come, it's
apparent they haven't yet. His
true freshmen accounted for just
nine points and three assists in
the 24th-ranked Wolverines'
77-53 win over Bucknell on
Monday night.
In that game, the first-years
let the scoring duties slide to
sophomore forward Zak Irvin
and senior forward MaxBielfeldt,
the latter of whom finished with
a career-high 18 points - half
of which came on 3-point shots
nobody in the building expected
him to take.
But Bielfeldt's night may
have distracted from the fact
that Michigan (2-0) has yet
to see substantial offensive
contributions from its freshman
class, which Beilein says hasn't
yet mastered his complex
offense.
However, Beilein isn't worried
that the freshmen will simply be
content to sit back and watch the
veterans shoulder the load.

TERESA MATHEW/Daily
Forward Kameron Chatman has started at the '4,' but his strong defense was overshadowed by an inconsistent jumper.

By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
Ten games ago, you likely
wouldn't have believed punter
Will Hagerup and placekicker
Matt Wile would be two of the
Michigan football team's most
consistent players.
You still mightnot believe it.
But as they head into their final
home game, the two seniors have
quietly delivered when called
upon - all the more crucial as
they fight for a berth in a bowl
game.
Wile has made the most
noticeable jump from the
beginning of the season, when he
was close to beingreplaced.After
he went 1-for-4 in the first two
games, Wile has since made all
but two of his 13 field goals - and
both of the misses were blocked.
"I think Matt had a couple
issues early, as we know, but I
think (it's) the way he's bounced
back," said Michigan coach
Brady Hoke.
Mainly, Wile struggled from
the right hash, the location from
where he missed all three of his
kicks early on. But since then,
he has made every one from that
location, which he chalked up to
repetition.
Now, he'll have to compensate
for something besides the
location oftheball: the weather.
"It'll be more difficult to stay
warm on the sideline, but I was
able to stay warm against Iowa
last year (when the game-time
temperature was 18 degrees),"
Wile said. "I guess I usually just
go into the game and go, 'Oh, I
have to kick this."'
Hagerup, on the other hand,
has only improved recently, but
few performances were more

important than his most recent
contest against Northwestern.
Against the Wildcats, he
placed three punts inside the 20,
including one right on the one-
yard line. His last punt of the
game pinned Northwestern deep
in its own zone, forcing it to use
more time in a game that came
down to the very last seconds.
"The one thing with Will -
probably his biggest weakness
- is what they used to call the
coffin corner kicks and those
kind of things," Hoke said. "ButI
think he's really improved in that
style. ... He's really gone out and
worked at it, because that wasn't
something as of a year ago thathe
really tried to do."
His drop-and-kick style has
become more consistent since
he struggled to find hang time
and distance on punts in games
against teams such as Minnesota
and Michigan State.
"He was kind of old school in
how he was mentored and trying
to hit the coffin corner," Hoke
said. "Well, I think he's really
gone to work improving on the
style using the technique he's
using now."
Added Hagerup: "I've helped
the team with field position, but I
think there are gameswhereIdid
not play up to my expectations."
Both Hagerup and Wile's
contributions could be all the
more important, as Michigan's
offense still struggles to find the
end zone. The Wolverines have
stalled right in the range within
the 35- and 45-yard lines, which
forces Wile to make a longer kick
or Hagerup to accurately place a
short punt.
And thankfully for the offense,
the people bailing it out are
playing their best.

He even cited freshman of learning it. The only thing we
development as a reason he kept can do is keep bringing them on,
Bielfeldt on the sidelines for and keep teaching them as much
all of Saturday's game against as possible. As the season goes

the Wolverines' blessing and
curse is that the freshmen likely

Kameron Chatman, in particular
- are capable of playing up to

Michigan's already-crowded
backcourt leaves little room
for the freshmen to appear at
guard or even small forward,
making their roles more fluid.
But wherever they play, the
Wolverines need to understand'
theirrole withinBeilein's system.
When they have multiple roles,
understanding each one becomes
all the more difficult.
"It's not pretty when they
get time, sometimes," Beilein
said. "But they're getting better,
believe it or not."

Arnone, Grinwis turn eyes
toward professional career

0

By WESLEY ROMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The end of the Michigan
men's soccer team's season may
have signaled the conclusion of
distinguished Michigan careers
for goalkeeper Adam Grinwis and
midfielder Tyler Arnone, but, if it
all goes to script, the duo's soccer
careers will just be starting.
Over the next few weeks,
the two fifth-year seniors will
embark on the difficult jouriey
to become professional soccer
players.
"I'd prefer the MLS because I
follow the league, and obviously I
love living and playing here in the
U.S.," Arnone said. "But I'm not
opposed to going abroad."
It surely will be a difficult
process to start, but they've been
laying the foundation for the past
four years.
Grinwis and Arnone began
their Michigan soccer careers
together - as sophomores. Both
redshirted their freshman years
- Arnone transferred in from St.
John's - but when they finally
began playing in 2011, they made
instant impacts.
From the first game, Arnone
was installed as a starter in
the center of the midfield, and
he thrived in his first season
in Ann Arbor. The Hicksville,
New York native started all
20 matches, scored twice and
was named to the Big Ten All-
Freshman Team.
Meanwhile, Grinwis also
fought his way into a major role
and emerged as the Wolverines'
first-choice goalkeeper, a title he
would not relinquish for the next
three years.
"I'd like to think that I helped
bridge the gap for the new guys
coming in to try and teach them
the ways of the University of
Michigan," Grinwis said, "while
also trying to be a good player for
(Michigan coach Chaka Daley)."
Though the team as a whole
didn't match their individual
successes - the duo didn't win

Goalkeeper Adam Grinwis said he'd like to play professionally in the U.S.

one regular- or post-season
trophy - the program now seems
poised for future success. It
seems likely that better recruits
and more time under Daley will
lead to the creation of a perennial
contender in Ann Arbor.
"Even though we didn't win
any trophies while I was here,"
Arnone said, "I think we were
the building blocks of something
special."
MLS scouts view college
soccer performances and
accomplishmentsas an important
part of a resume, but there are
other factors to consider.
To increase exposure, both
Arnone and Grinwis have trained
with MLS teams for the past few
summers. These opportunities
have proven invaluable for both
the players and the MLS teams,
which can see firsthand how they
measured up.
Getting up to speed has meant
sacrificing what could have been
their postseason break. Even

with the early winter weather,
on most days you can find the
Grinwis and Arnone working
together in some capacity to get
better physically and technically.
All of this work is building up
to Jan. 15, the date of the MLS
SuperDraft.
Arnone thinks that, regardless
of whether he receives an
invitation to the MLS Combine,
he has somethingspecial to offer
to professional teams.
"Some players focus mostly on
attacking or defending," Arnone
said. "But I think I have a little
something of both in my locker."
If the MLS doesn't work out
for the two, then they'll turn
their attentions to either the
NASL if they want to remain
domestically, or abroad.
But until they are told
otherwise, the duo will continue
working as hard as they can to
make their dream a reality.
And just like the past four
years,they'llbeworkingtogether.

is - about Calvin Klein's newest

wasn't until
her inter-

as "plus-sized" that everyone on

against their keyboards.
More recently, size-16 model
Candice Huffine has been added
to the roster of women included
in the 2015 Pirelli calendar. For
the unfamiliar, the Pirelli calen-
dar is highly exclusive, not only in
its distribution, but for its choice
of photographers and models. In
short: it's a big fucking deal to be
a part of it.
I'm notcgoing to pretend that I
have something groundbreaking
to add to the narrative of "plus-
sized" models in the fashion
industry. A lot, maybe too much,
has already been said on the
topic. By doing a simple Google
search of the women or compa-
nies above, views on the matter
are ubiquitous and very, very
loud.
The debate over the term
"plus-sized" has been around
longer than I've been interested
in fashion. Issues like who can
be defined as plus-sized and
whether or not the term should
even be accepted into the indus-

try's vocabulary are constantly
part of the dialogue. New pseudo-
scandals regarding the size of
female models pop up a few times
each year. They're too skinny,
they're too fat, they're not thin
enough to be high fashion, they're
not big enough to be plus-sized.
It's the constant discussion that
will never go away, but dear godI
wish it would.
This column is in no way an
attempt to make some poignant
statement about the topic of
weight in fashion, and believe me,
I'd be the last person interested
in readingthe thoughts of a self-
righteous undergrad on basically
anything. Sadly, I pretty much am
a self-righteous undergrad and I
have a few grievances to air.
Body image is a nuanced con-
cept that we're constantly trying
to generalize; models must be
skinny, athletes mustbe bulky,
Renee Zellweger's face must
always look like Renee Zellwe-
ger's face circa 2003. Unfortu-
nately (and maybe this is my
inner-cranky grandma speak-
ing), we live in a time of height-
ened self-importance, where
every thought is entertained
with a "like" or a "favorite" and
dignified with additional com-
ments of support or fervent dis-
approval.
Calvin Klein never described
Myla Dalbesio as a plus-sized
model, and they shouldn't have.
The more we see different kinds
of women in magazines, on bill-
boards, walking down runways
with no qualifiers, the faster it
will become "normal." Elle made
a mistake by labeling Myla "plus-
sized," and not just because a
size 10 isn't actually "plus-sized"
- but because they shouldn't
have been labeling her in the
first place. But even after they

took down the tweet with the
erroneous adjective, people were
still fueling the hell-storm with
tweets, think-pieces and other
fluffy bullshit that was shouting
very loudly but saying close to
nothing.
Chrissy Teigen, another
model who is no stranger to
conversations about weight
responded to the controversy by
saying"I saw the photo, (Myla)
looked beautiful - who cares?"
and added that "the Internet is
full of fake outrage."
Fake outrage that hinders the
progress to the issue at hand.
Dwelling on mistakes and con-
tinuing to point fingers isn't
going to make fashion a more
accepting place. Applauding and
supporting brands that strive
for change, take risks and find
beauty beyond the conventional
will.
Fashion is constantly evolv-
ing and changing its perceptions
of beauty. There were the '70s
bombshells with teased, bleach
blonde hair, the All-American
girls of the '80s and of course,
the waify heroin chic models
of the '90s. As the concepts
of beauty continue to be chal-
lenged - as they should - fash-
ion will hopefully continue to
become a more inclusive space.
In an interview with
"The Today Show," Dalbesio
expressed her excitement about
being in the Calvin Klein cam-
paign, saying she was "right
alongside all of the other girls
of varying shapes andsizes, and
(Calvin Klein) didn't make a fuss
about it."
And neither should we.

"Kill Bill" "The Fall"

BBC

When I was 10 years old - yes, 10 years old - I
convinced my parents to let me rent "Kill Bill Vol-
ume 1." I didn't know who Quentin Tarantino was,
but I had an unshakable feeling I was going to like
this movie. 11 years later, as I write this against a
"Kill Bill" computer background (on a "Kill Bill"
sticker-clad computer), I guess you can sayI liked it
a lot. And earlier this year, much to my exuberance,
Netflix has finally added both titles to its streaming
repertoire - the whole gory story. "Kill Bill" details
The Bride's (Uma Thurman, "Batman & Robin")
roaring rampage of revenge across its sprawling
four hour running time. The first volume - a no-
holds-barred action epic - juxtaposes the quieter
second volume - a cathartic, satisfying western-
tinged climax. Tarantino might always be remem-
bered for his genius 1994 directorial debut "Pulp
Fiction," or for his Academy Award-winning follow-
ups "Inglorious Basterds" and "Django Unchained,"
but it's "Kill Bill" that will always hold the primary
cinematic piece of my heart. And what could be bet-
ter than this cool, energetic, stylistic masterpiece
just a few clicks away?

Jamie Dornan is soon to be a household name, if
he's not known, already. The Irish-accented, dark-
scruffed, suit-and-tied star of the film adaptation of
"Fifty Shades of Grey," which comes out Feb. 13, is
about to reach sex symbol status. So you are going
to know him. But not for the right reasons. Unbe-
knownst to most, Dornan also starred in the barely-
seen 2013 BBC series "The Fall," alongside "The
X-Files" star Gillian Anderson. The six episode first
season follows Anderson as a hard-edged English
investigator on the case of an Irish serial killer, whose
chosen prey areyoung professional women.Inatwist
on the whodunnit trope, the first scene of the show
reveals Dornan as Paul Spector, the killer, stalking
and then attacking a young woman in her home. It's
a chilling scene that speaks to the greater themes
in "The Fall" - the show is not interested in who is
performing the murders, but developing the psychol-
ogy behind Paul. Surprisingly eloquent and detailed,
"The Fall" goes beyond classic law and order serials
to develop a cast of flawed, potent characters. It's
Dornan at his best, regardless of how sexy of a Chris-
tian Grey he maybe come February.

One dream.
Four Jasaicans.
Twenty below zero.

"Cool Runnings"
As far as early to mid-'90s films go, "Cool Run-
nings" is royalty ("Heavyweights" is king, of course,
but Netflix has yet to get the memo). Very loosely
based on the 1988 Jamaican bobsled team, the film
follows a group of young men from Jamaica as they
train for the Winter Olympics with none other than
Irv Blitzer (John Candy, "Uncle Buck") at the helm. If
you're wondering if this movie still holds up compared
to the last time you watched it, presumably in 1994, it
does. And Doug E. Doug gives the performance of a
lifetime. Accordingto Wikipedia, "Cool Runnings" is
also the last John Candy film to be released while he
was alive, cementing its place among cinema's best.
The last time I watched it, I drank three to four Bud
Light Limes, sat on my bed under my electric blanket
and had the time of mylife.

"Californication"
Like I do for most shows, I started watching
"Californication" after it had already finished.
I was perusing Netflix one day, and I saw
the image of Hank Moody with a cigarette
dangling from his mouth. I cued up the
first episode, and before I knew it, I was
12 episodes in. I'll be the first to admit it:
"Californication" isn't a perfect show. It can be 9
infantile, repetitive, casually misogynist and
homophobic, and the last season sucks. But it's
such a gleefully wrong show. Sex, drugs and
rock 'n' roll, condensed into half-hour episodes
that always manage to have a conscience in the
end. Seriously - a successful writer struggles
to keep it in his pants, and not drink himself to
death. It's every college kid's dream!

ICE
From Page1B
online forums insist on
specific temperatures and
tempering times, but one of the
team's most talented carvers,
LSA junior Neil Anderson,
simply knocks on the ice which
sounds less hollow as it melts.
On asnippy November morning,
Anderson was getting ready to
supervise a carving for younger
members: a lumbar vertebrae
for one of the teammate's
kinesiology classes.
"You don't need experience
to join the team, it's more of
a learning thing to have fun
and practice," said business
sophomore Nick Warminski,
Business and Events Manager
of the team. "I would have
never met aslot of these people:
the age difference, the major
difference, where we live, etc.,
but we all click because we love
to ice carve."
But despite the team's
relative inexperience, it has
placed in several competitions
over the years. Last year, the
team's treasurer, Engineering
junior Sam Friedman, and his
partner LSA and Art & Design
graduate Alicia Chiaravalli
placed third at Plymouth
Ice Festival. They carved an
aquatic scene, complete with a
turtle and a grove of coral.
Ice carving is considered
a culinary art, which means
the team mostly competes
against local trade schools
and community colleges with
culinaryprograms. The schools
have dedicated carving space,
funding and practice time,
making Michigan's placement
a remarkable feat.
Like any craft, ice carving
is equal parts artistry
and technical skill. First,
teammates working in groups
of two to three trace a template
on big sheets of papers using
images projected on a wall.
The template is 'glued' on the
ice block with water, and a
chainsaw makes the rough
structural carves, called big
cuts. after that, a mix of manual
and electric tools transform the
cookie cutter-like silhouette
into a recognizable three-
dimensional form.
"A logo for a company will
take about an hour and a half,
buta full sculpture takes closer
to three to four," Hamet said.
Those three to four hours
are a dance between the
notoriously mercurial medium
and the artist. Choosing the
right image is crucial - a too-
small image doesn't efficiently
utilize the expensive block of
ice; Hamet recalls a full block
of ice that slowly turned into a
tiny swan, "a valuable lesson,"
as he put it.
An unwieldy structure
poses its own problems, too:
Friedman recalls an event
when his partner fused two
blocks of ice together, however
it wasn't cold enough for the
fuse to properly set, causing
the sculpture she had spent
five hours on to topple over.
And of course, just mastering
the tools is an adjustment.

CHEFS ANN ARBOR

David Burnell keeps his ingredients fresh and local, and most importantly, keeps people happy with great food.

Burnell keeps it
fresh at Lena and
Habana
By DANIELLE
RAYKHINSHTEYN
Daily Arts Writer
For David Burnell, family
comes first. Local ingredients
take a close second.
Burnell is the executive chef
at Main Street restaurants
Lena - a South-and-Central-
American based, new-age
eatery - and Habana - a Latin-
inspired happy hour dance club
located below Lena. Burnell
learned how to cook at a
young age with help from his
grandfather.
"Most of my best family
memories have always been
around the dinner table,"
Burnell said.
Coming from Polish heritage,
Burnell used to help his
grandfather make traditional
old-world dishes. When he
grew up, he realized he had a
talent for it.
"I grew up with the farm-
to-table approach before it
got popular," he said. "At my
old restaurant, my Saturday
specials were always what I
got from the farmers market.
I have a garden at home, so I
support the cause from grower
to table."
As a teenager, Burnell
secured his first kitchen job
as a dishwasher and then
began to work his way up. He
attended Schoolcraft College
for culinary arts, and he's been
an executive chef at various
restaurants around the metro-
Detroit area for 10 years. He's
been at Lena for seven months
now.
In September, Burnell
decided to update the Lena and
Habana menus. He wanted to
make a push for a higher quality

and a higher authenticity of
food.
"We geared the menus
towards closer, fresher, local
ingredients, but also bigger,
bolder spices, really taking
South American and Central
American food and bringing
it up to a more modern level
than what you would get on the
street in Brazil or Argentina,"
he said.
The challenge in coming
to Lena, Burnell said, was
learning how to cook a different
kind of cuisine from anything
he had served before. His
previous job had been Italian
fine dining, and he said being
able to experiment more with
different kinds of flavors and
spices is exciting.
"I'm a big history buff, so
I like to research food. I like
to know where it came from,
why it's prepared that way
and things like that, so coming
to this restaurant was a good
historical challenge for me," he
said. "It gave me a new set of
goals to figure out 'what's this
cuisine all about, and how can
I modernize it for being in Ann
Arbor and making it different
from everything else on the
block?' "
One way Burnell does that is
by keeping his ingredients fresh
and local. While he uses local
produce and meat whenever he
can, he said his favorite item to
use in the daily specials is fresh
fish - he lauded the ability to
be able to have fish shipped
from anywhere in the world,
but he also said that a perk of
cooking in Michigan is the
access to the Great Lakes.
"My produce company that
I work with here in Ann Arbor
[Frog Holler Produce] sources
as much local Michigan
produce as possible," he said. "I
also try to bring in as much as I
can with meats from Michigan,
as well. Seafood, if it's in fresh
water ... comes right out of lake

Michigan."
While Burnell said the
Tampa Bay-esque Cuban
sandwich is his favorite on
Lena's menu, he said he strives
to create diverse plates every
morning when he prepares the
daily specials.
"When I get to the final dish,
I say to myself, would I eat this
or would I not eat this? Really
it's just putting different flavor
profiles together to make
something unique."
While Burnell is no longer
surrounded by the Polish food
of his childhood, he still hopes
to carry on the ideals instilled
in him around his family
dinner table.
"I would be perfectly happy
with a food truck on a beach or
near some water and to cook off
a charcoal grill off the back of
it. I wouldn't really care," he
said. "As long as I'm producing
good food and people are
happy, then I'm happy."
And he brings these values in
his kitchen, aswell. He saidthat
things inevitably go wrong, but
he's learned how to handle any
problems that arise. Food and
those who prepare it together
are like a family to him.
"I have bailed a couple
of cooks out of jail before,"
Burnell said. "I look over my
staff, and I look out for them. I
take care of my staff, and they
take care of me."
Food, for Burnell, is more
than just a creative outlet or
nourishment. He cooks to bring
people together - to make
them happy - and that's why
you can find everything from
dancing to brunch to drinks to
dinner at Lena and Habana.
In the end, Burnelljust wants
to give you the same feeling
he had while cooking with his
grandfather- he wants you to
feel at home.
"I like to create just good,
honest food that people will be
excited to try," he said.

the scent of
decompos-

wafting from the distant
neighborhoods snaking along
the outskirts of campus. As
I trekked through the con-
crete maze from the baseball
stadium to Kipke Drive, the
location of the Student The-
atre Arts Complex, I had the
unnerving feeling that I was
being watched, as if some-
one within the dark windows
of the athletic facilities was
peering down, waiting for me
to pass by. Maybe it was the
video clips of the Demon Bar-
ber I had watched in prepara-
tion for the night, or maybe it
was that Mrs. Lovett's ballad
"Worst Pies in London" still
rang shrilly in my head, but
I felt Sweeney Todd's pres-
ence - cold, bitter and hushed
- lurking in the night air. I
quickened my pace and finally
arrived at the throbbing heart
ofthe production.
The STAC is, quite literally,
an underground operation.
Upon entering, I was certain
that I was in the wrong place.
I cautiously made my way to
a descending staircase, feel-
ing very much alone in the
silence of the building, until a
young man carrying a barstool
walked across the landing and
looked up at me.
"Hello!" he said cheerfully,
unperturbed. He shifted the
stool to his hip and brandished
his hand. "I'm Ryan Lucas,
MUSKET producer. You must
be the writer from the Daily.
We're all in here."
Ryan led me to a rickety
table where a handful of cast
members and producers had
gathered to eat Paneratakeout
before rehearsal began (the
rehearsals, I later learned, ran
six days a week from 7 to 11
at night). While they ate, the
crew took turns introducing
themselves and their majors,
as well as what drew them
to join MUSKET in the first
place.
MUSKET prides itself on
being a theatre group that's
not just for theater kids. Since
its establishment in 1908, the
quiet but impactful group has
welcomed University students
of all disciplines, from engi-
neers to business students to

neuroscience majors, all of
whom have one thing in com-
mon: a passion for theater.
"MUSKET is the place to
come if you love to act, but
don't necessarily want to do it
for the rest of your life," said
Hillary Ginsberg, a senior
double-majoring in Business
and Screen Arts and Cultures.
She found out about the
group from a classmate who
had nudged her in class one
day and asked whether she
liked to sing. Surprised, Gins-
berghad said yes and humored
her friend " by auditioning
for MUSKET's production
of "Hairspray." She landed
the lead role and hasn't left
the group since. This year, in
"Sweeney Todd," she is serv-
ing as a producer with Lucas,
coordinating inter-staff com-
munication and overseeing
the organizational details of
the show.
Though the crew recruits
all types of students, there's
still a strong showing from
the School of Music, Theatre
& Dance. Director Henry Net-
tleton is a senior majoring in
Musical Theatre and has every
intention of pursuing a career
on stage after graduation.
"I speak for myself when I
say that yes, I will be acting
or directing in the years to
come," Nettleton said. "Can
I say the same for everyone
here? Absolutely not. But
that's what makes what we're
doing right here, right now, so
cool. We only have four years
to mingle with so many differ-
ent kids - chemists, business
students, you name
it - and we won't get
that chance in the
real world."
"Sweeney Todd:
The Demon Bar-
ber of Fleet Street"
first debuted on
Broadway in 1979,
directed by the infa-
mous Harold Prince
("Phantom of the
Opera") and con-
tinues to be revered
as the Holy Book
of Musical Theater.
On the surface, the
grim tale spins like
an old-timey urban
legend, the kind
of scary story par-
ents tell their kids
to keep them from
sneaking out at night
(don't let Sweeney
Todd snatch you!).
The story goes
that a vengeful
barber under the
fictional name of
Sweeney Todd finds
his way back to
London after being
exiled by the corrupt
Judge Turpin, who
had lusted for Todd's
beautiful wife Lucy.
Upon his arrival,
Todd is informed
by Mrs. Lovett, the
owner of a pie shop
on the ground floor Sweeney T

of his old barber shop, that
after Benjamin Barker (Todd)
had been exiled, Judge Turpin
had lured Lucy to his home,
raped her, then kept the cou-
ple's infant daughter, Joanna,
confined with him. Infuriat-
ed, Todd seeks to unleash hell
on the streets of London for
revenge. He moves back into
his barbershop and opens
business, darkly boasting "the
closest shave" in the city. In
alliance with Mrs. Lovett,
Todd uses shaving razors to
slice the throats of his clients
and then dumps their bodies
downstairs for his partner to
bake the flesh into meat pies.
As the bodies pile up and the
pies grow in popularity, Todd
patiently waits for Judge Tur-
pin to come in for a shave.
It's a creepy tale with an
amazing set and soundtrack,
yet it seemed doubtful that
Victorian-era "Sweeney
Todd" could be relevant to
students at U-M. Last year,
MUSKET presented "RENT,"
which addressed more obvi-
ously accessible issues of
discrimination, identity and
acceptance. What does "Swee-
ney Todd" teach us, other than
not to eat MoJo's mystery
meat?
"The play is timeless
because it presents lust,
revenge and grief. Whether
we like it or not, we identify
with Sweeney. Think of it this
way," Nettleton said, press-
ing his fingertips together.
"You're in line behind some
obnoxious person at Starbucks
and all you can think about is

how much you want to punch
the guy in the head. You don't,
but you think it. The only
difference between you and
Sweeney is that he acts on his
murderous thoughts."
The production itself fol-
lows the same idea: instead
of recreating the Broadway
musical, the MUSKET actors
are telling the story of Swee-
ney Todd, posing as college-
aged kids who have broken
into an old, abandoned attic
and decide to scare each other
with a ghost story.
"Though the set changes,
we never leave the attic," said
Carly Snyder, a junior musi-
cal theatre major who plays
Joanna. "Everything that we
use to act out the story has
to be found in an attic. An
overturned bicycle becomes
the meat grinder; a box is the
barbershop seat. We're real-
ly playing off the idea that
'Sweeney Todd' needs very
little to make it spectacular -
the music speaks for itself."
Nettleton strongly agrees.
"Originally I asked myself,
what play can I stage with
absolutely nothing? 'Sweeney
Todd' was it. I wanted to do
it with just a box, a light bulb,
and maybe a birdcage," he
said, laughing. "We ended up
with a slightly more elaborate
set, but the story is still the
centerpiece."
This weekend the Demon
Barber will be lurking on
Fletcher Street rather than
Fleet Street, inviting you to
come "attend the tale of Swee-
ney Todd."

ny moment now, I
should hear a blip
sound of a Facebook
notification, indicating that my
mother has posted "the video"
on my wall. It's
nothing too out
there, just an
instructional
video from
the New
York Times
on how to .
correctly carve GIANCARLO
a turkey, as BUONOMO
demonstrated
by a butcher.
She's posted it on my wall for
the past three years, always
with a playful message of "study
up, you only have a week :)." At
this point, having watched my
grandfather, then uncle, carve
the bird for so many years, I'm
pretty sure I know how to get
the meat off the bone. Most
likely, my mom sends me the
video for tradition's sake. But
in those frosty days leading up
to our festival of the harvest, I
always taste a fearful vinegar on
my gravy palate.
"What if I mess up this
year?" I wonder. It's not too
hard to imagine. A turkey, as
the video makes clear, doesn't
dismember itself. With one slip
of the knife, the breast is gashed
and unsliceable. If I grab the
drumstick too roughly, the crisp
blanket of skin might tear off.
I used to have these kinds of
worries about grilling chicken
or cooking pasta, but not after
preparing them several times a
week for many years. But when
you carve a turkey only one
Thursday in November, practice
and game-day are the same
thing.
I'm not alone in my gobbler-
induced anxiety. Since last
week, a glut of articles have been
published, as they are every
year, advising people on how to
source, marinate, roast, rest and
carve that damn poultry. Why?
Because cooking a whole turkey
is really fucking hard. It's a
culinary endeavor beyond what
most of us attempt on a daily
basis. This brings up an obvious
question: Why do we center a
holiday around a dish that most
of us have an arduous - and
often ultimately disappointing -
time cooking?
There have been many
inquiries into the origins of
turkey-eating on Thanksgiving.
Contrary to the canonical story,
the Pilgrims and Wampanoag
most likely didn't eat turkey
when they sat down for a
communal feast back in 1621.
Their meal probably consisted of
oysters, mussels, geese, venison,
corn and berries (doesn't sound
too bad, right?). But dining on
the esteemed Meleagris gallopavo
was solidified when Abraham
Lincoln made Thanksgiving
a national holiday in 1863. As
an article from Slate explains,
whole turkey was the perfect
protein for this new holiday. It's
big enough to feed a family (or
two) and turkeys are expendable;
they don't provide milk or eggs
or labor, and therefore wouldn't
have to be saved for the winter.
By the time these concerns

were nullified by industry and
urbanization, turkey had become
such an iconic tradition that no
one thought to do otherwise.
But I think this explanation is
a little too easy. I think, for all
of our kvetching and stressing
and fussing, Americans really

like Thanksgiving turkey.
And it's not because we like
the taste; even with the most
attentive cooking, turkey is often
anemic, dry, tough and sinewy,
mostly because it's difficult
to cook evenly. Rather, I think
Americans love Thanksgiving
turkey because it is, in and
of itself, so quintessentially
American.
First of all, serving a whole
turkey is sentimental. We are,
as a nation, gripped by a vision
of some golden past, a halcyon
period of pastoral existence
where everything was simple
and rugged. When we sit around
the table on Thanksgiving, we all
imagine, for a moment, being the
simple pilgrims who shot this
turkey ourselves and now can
feast on the bounty of the hunt.
Going with that, a whole
turkey is opulent, and America
is an opulent land. Think back
to last Thanksgiving. Did you
finish the turkey? No one ever
does. Even after a dozen people
gorge themselves, there's always
a shoe-box sized tupperware
of meat left. This carnivorous
decadence is an American ideal,
which influenced every culinary
tradition that passed through
Ellis Island. Spaghetti and
meatballs, for example, is the
result of poor southern-Italian
immigrants' joy in discovering
that meat was widely available in
their new home, which they then
added to their old-world sauce
with abandon.
Thanksgiving turkey is
also competitive. I think it
speaks volumes that there is
such a tradition of football on
Thanksgiving, and Americans
can get as competitive with
turkey skin as they do with
the pigskin. Because almost
every family cooks one on
Thanksgiving, my turkey can
suddenly be compared to others.
Ask anyone what they're serving
this year, and inevitably you'll
get into an argument over whose
method of cooking is superior.
Finally, Americans love
cooking turkey precisely
because it's so difficult. In On
Photography, Susan Sontag
argued that Americans take
pictures on vacation because
they're incapable of actually
taking a vacation; they have to
work even when supposedly
resting. Thanksgiving turkey is
much the same. Wrestling the
bird in and out of a vat of brine
is akin to handling a greasy
beachball. Cooking it takes
hours and hours of prodding
and basting and covering and
uncovering the breasts so that
they don't overcook. Cleaning
up after carving is like mopping
up a crime scene. All told, this
doesn't make for a very restful
holiday.
So is the turkey worth it?
To be perfectly honest, I'd be
much happier braising short
ribs or roasting a pig. But then
again, Thanksgiving is never
about what you want to do, but
rather what you have to do.
Like chatting with Republican
in-laws, or cleaning a colossus-
sized pile of dishes, you just
have to cook a turkey, because
the holiday, for reasons unclear

but strongly felt, wouldn't mean
much without it.
I'll just have to start sharpening
my knives.
