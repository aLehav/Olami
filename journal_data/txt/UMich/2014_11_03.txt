DAVE BRANDON RESIGNS
Former Steelecase CEO Jim Hackett to serve as interim AD, Schlissel announces

After resignation,
9 contract settlement
topayformerAD $3M
By JENNIFER CALFAS
ManagingNews Editor
Though Dave Brandon will
no longer serve as the Univer-
sity's Athletic Director starting
Nov. 1, the money will keep roll-
ing in.
Brandon's settlement agree-
ment, signed by him and Uni-
versity President Mark Schlissel
on Oct. 30, includes a $3 mil-
lion total compensation from
the University through June 30,
2018, which will be granted to
him in monthly installments.
If Brandon is hired by another
employer, the University has the
power to reduce the remaining
amount of compensation.
The Athletic Department cur-
rently funds Brandon's base sal-
ary and will continue to pay for
his future compensation.
Brandon will be paid
$700,000 from Nov. 1, 2014
through June 30, 2015; $950,000
from July 1, 2015 through June
30, 2016; $750,000 from July
1, 2016 through June 30, 2017;
and $600,000 from July 1, 2017
through June 30, 2018.
Before resigning, Brandon's
base salary was $900,000.
According to his contract exten-
sion, that amount was scheduled
to increase to $1.05 million in
2018, the final year of his con-
tract.

that if the University terminates

Following Dave Brandon's
resignation on Friday as Ath-
letic Director, the University has
named former Steelcase CEO
James Hackett Interim Athletic
Director.
Hackett is the current vice
chair and director of Steelcase,
an office furniture manufactur-
ing company. He joined the firm
in 1981 and spent the next13 years
working his way up through the
management structure before
he was named CEO in December
1994.
Hackett resigned the execu-
tive post on Feb. 28, 2014. He
also serves as the non-executive
Chairman of the Board at Fifth
Third Bank, a member of the Ford
Motor Company's Board of Direc-
tors and a member of the Board
of Trustees of The Northwestern
Mutual Life Insurance Company.
"Jim is a highly experienced
and respected business leader, a
man of integrity, and a devoted
member of our Michigan commu-
nity," said University President
Mark Schlissel at the introduc-
tory press conference. "He led
(Steelcase) as it transitioned from
traditional manufacturing to
an innovative global company,
and now brings that success and

Jim Hackett, a former player under Bo Schembechler and former CEO of Steelcase, was announced as the University's interim athletic director Friday, succeeding
Dave Brandon. His appointment continues a trend of businessmen holding the position.

his contract or he resigns, he will
receive the remainder of his base
salary. University spokesman
Rick Fitzgerald said Brandon's
settlement ended up being lower
than the amount originally stat-
ed in the contract because it was
renegotiated this week.
The contract agreement also
states that Brandon will assist
Schissel and Interim Athletic

Director Jim Hackett during the
leadership transition.
Following the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act, which requires "temporary
continuation" of health coverage
upon resignation or termination,
the University will cover Bran-
don's health care benefits until
June 30, 2015. If Brandon begins
work for another employer, the

University will no longer be
responsible for the coverage.
Since Brandon served as a
University regent from 1999 to
2006, he will keep two seats at
football, basketball and hock-
ey games reserved for regents
emeritus.
Additionally, under the settle-
ment agreement, Brandon will
not "issue any disparaging state-

ments regarding the University,
Athletic Department, the Board
of Regents, and their employ-
ees, representatives, or agents."
Brandon has not released any
formal statement since Schlis-
sel's announcement of his resig-
nation and could not be reached
for comment. Fitzgerald said
Brandon currently does not have
a scheduled statement.

DETROIT - Following a dis-
mal Democratic showing in 2010
that saw Republicans elected to
multiple state offices and gain

control of the state legislature,
Michigan Democrats have made
change over the past four years a
consistent campaign theme this
election cycle.
Speaking at a rally at Wayne
State University on Saturday for
the party's last big get-out-the-
vote push before Tuesday's elec-
tion, President Barack Obama
delivered on that message, echo-
ing his own previous campaign
focuses of hope and change.
For the past six presidential

elections, Michigan has voted
blue. But in midterm elections -
and especially in 2010 - Repub-
licans have traditionally had the
edge, because many Democratic
voters who turn out for presiden-
tial elections have stayed home
for the less-mobilizing midterms.
"When you step into that
voting booth, you are making
a choice not just about candi-
dates or parties," Obama told the
crowd. "You are making a choice

Steven Levitt, co-author
of the famed economics book
"Freakonomics" and a Uni-

Public Policy's centennial cel-
ebration. Levitt now works at
Spin For Good, a consulting

ture to a sold-out audience at
Rackham Auditorium Friday
was a collection of quirky anec-
dotes not unlike his three best-
selling books: "Freakonomics,"
"SuperFreakonomics," and the
new "Think likea Freak."

What do you think is the
most unconventional piece
of advice in your new book,
"Think Like A Freak"?
In society, there's such a
strong pressure not to quit -
winners never quit, quitters
never win. And in experiments
in a study I've done where I
got 25,000 people to come to
my website and flip coins and
decide whether to, say, quit
their jobs or break up with their
boyfriend or girlfriend and the
evidence came up really defini-
tively that people just don't quit
enough at all. The biggest and
best piece of advice in our book
is when you're not sure - you
can't decide whether to quit

After a year when the Univer-

Arbor and across the country,
the administration has rolled out
several initiatives and programs
designed to address some of the

SOLIDARITY FOREVER
Clerical workers unionized

Forty years ago this week
(Nov. 2,1974)
University clerical employees
voted to join the United Auto
Workers in a five-dayelection that
asked staff to choose between
joining the UAW and remaining
without a union. The vote fol-
lowed almost a year of efforts on
the part of the University's 3,200
clerical workers to form a union.
"I'm very happy and not really
surprised," clerical organizer
Pam O'Connor said after the vote.
The vote was 1,144 in favor to
920 not in favor. Following the
announcement, Hubert Emer-
ick, the UAW's associate national
director for technical, office and
professional staff, said the newly
formed union would be called the

Concerned Clericals for Action.
Thirty years ago this week

representative on the Univer-

in conjunction with researchers
at the Woods Hole Oceanic Insti-
tute in Massachusetts.
The proposal, submitted for
funding to the National Science
Foundation, called for research
that would help improve the U.S.
Navy's anti-submarine capabili-
ties, according to Aronoff, which
would violate the classified
research rules of the University.

expressed concern regarding the
cuts of more than 36 classes, pri-

The cuts, which occurred due
to budget shortfalls of at least
$300,000 according to CASL
Dean Katie Anderson-Levitt,
were announced after course
guides had already been printed
and distributed.
Cuts were also projected to

LEVITT
From Page 1A
something or to break something
off - almost for sure you should
quit. There's not nearly enough
quitting in society. There's way
too much perseverance, there's
waytoo much sticking with stuff.
I've read alot about howyou're
not really into economic indi-
cators, the stock market and
those sorts of things despite
being an economics profes-
sor at Chicago. You prefer
to observe the world around
you. So, what advice would
you have for undergraduates
and graduates who are going
through school and the diffi-
culties and drudgework that
school involves? How could
they maintain their creative
spirit?
That is a great question and a
hard question. Success in school
is not closely tied to creativity. I
can speak for myself that I made
it through an undergrad at Har-
vard notthinking once. I was just
an incredibly good memorizer
and absorber of information and
so I could get A's without hav-
ing to think at all. It wasn't until
I got into the real world that I
realized that anyone asked me
to think. There's this tension
between simply memorizing and
regurgitating to do well in school
and actually exploring ideas and
being excited and following tan-
gents. In the end as I look back
on my own life and the people
around me, I think the people
who did what they loved and who
were less worried about exactly
their GPA and more worried-
about what they had passions for,

I think those people turned out
to be more happy in life. ... If I
could go back and talk to my stu-
dent self I would say "care a little
less and explore a little more."
A lot of your findings have
been met with controversy,
such as the theory that legal-
ized abortion reduces crime.
How can students deal with
controversy when they gradu-
ate?
One of my mentors was Gary
Becker, who was a famous
economist who is a Nobel Prize
winner who did a lot of contro-
versial work who just died last
year..And one time when I was
being criticized a lot - I've been
criticized for a lot of things so I
don't remember the particular
case - he sat me down and he
said, "so how do you like being
criticized?" and we talked about
what was going on, I told him
about the criticisms. And he said
something which I think is really
true. He said, "It's no fun being
criticized, but it's even worse
to be ignored." He said, "The
thing that really drove me crazy
is when people ignored what I
did." So if you think you're right,
or even better, you know you're
right, then it's not so hard to take
the criticism. If you figure you're
wrong and it turns out you're
wrong, I think it's incredibly
important to admit that you're
wrong, and to go fighta different
battle. But there's nothing worse
than trying to protect a pub-
lic image that is not warranted,
because you just don't want to
be embarrassed. There were a
couple times where I've just plain
been wrong and I admitted I was
wrong and I'm glad I did and that
worked out well.
But I think it's even what

you're saying is less an issue
for academics. Because part of
academics is the acceptance of
a wide variety of ideas, what
you're saying really, really binds
is in the workplace because
firms and organizations are very
socialentities. And there arevery
strong norms and it's very hard
to go against the grain in a firm,
it's very hard to rock the boat in
a firm. There's not the challenge
that there is in academics. That's
where the really hard issues
come up.
Your beginning and most
famous research concerned
crime. But, with your role at
Chicago, as a consultant and
your current book focusing on
advice,it seems that that focus
was diminished. How do you
ensure that that passion is still
part of your daily work?
What I love to do more than
anything is get a big pile of data
and a computer and me and the
computer and the data and just
understand it. Don't know why
but for just the weirdness that
I have is that I love to do that.
And the sad thing is that I almost
never get to do that anymore and
it really is a loss and a sign that
I did something wrong that now
I end up doing things that I can't
delegate. ... It's really a waste in
the sense that I get to do a lot
of things that for many people
would *be really fun, but they're
not that much fun for me. The
things that I don't get to do are
the things that aren't so much
fun for other people. So I don't
know, maybe someday, ifI'mtrue
to my own advice pretty soon I'll
go back to my roots and I'll spend
a lot more time in front of a com-
puter and a lot less time talking
to nice people like you.

the BSU began the #BBUM Twit-
ter campaign, in Black students
tweeted about their experiences
at the University.
Many of these tweets detailed
negative experiences, including
campus tolerance for racial bias
and a lack of minority voices,
and called for the University to
change its approach to diversity
on campus.
In a September interview with
The Michigan Daily, E. Royster
Harper, vice president of student
life, said for campus culture to
become more inclusive, the Uni-
versity community must advance
cultural shifts and promote a
stronger sense of unity among
members of the student body.
"We can all decide to watch
out for each other," she said. "It's
a choice we make all the time."
Concerns about diversity and
the respect afforded to people of
all identities are not new issues.
t The Expect Respect Campaign,
which aims to "create and main-
tain a respectful and inclusive
environment that provides the
support and opportunity neces-
sary for each member of our com-
munity to prosper and achieve,"
began in 2005 in response to a
widely known incident where
two students were harassed and
assaulted due to their ethnicity.
The campaign was created as a

way for students to anonymously
report instances of violence and
hate on campus.
Despite its relative longev-
ity in the University community,
Expect Respect is also work-
ing on new initiatives to address
some of the institutions contem-
porary challenges. Organizers
are currently developing a stu-
dent steering committee to create
new programs that encourage a
respectful campus environment,
including collaborations with
various departments and organi-
zations like Greek Life and Uni-
versity Health Service.
Inclusive Language Initiative
Despite Expect Respect's ini-
tial popularity, LSA junior Kida-
da Malloy, an Expect Respect
program assistant, said she is
worried the program isn't as
impactful now that all of the stu-
dents who initially spearheaded
the program graduated.
Malloy said she hopes the
Inclusive Language Campaign
will reintroduce some of the
same themes promoted by Expect
Respect. The ILC, which started
at the beginning of the semester
and is modeled after a similar
program in Maryland, aims to
educate students about the power
of words and their potential to
cause offense.
"I'm really happy we have the
ILC this year that does more
action around campus," Mal-
loy said. "A lot of students know
about the Expect Respect pledge
and they know that on campus
they're supposed to be respect-
ful of people of different cultures,
but I'm notsure if they actually do
that. The ILC actually gets them
to do those things that Expect
Respect wants from the commu-

nity. I'm excited to bring it back."
The ILC began with an event
where about 400 students and
staff signed a pledge to avoid
using harmful language and to
strive for inclusive dialogue.
"A lot of the time we use words
without understanding the
impact they have on others," said
Meghan McCullough, a graduate
student in the School of Social.
Work and a Diversity and Inclu-
sion intern. "The ILC is about
raising awareness about how
other people are impacted by the
words that we use and how that
contributes to our campus cul-
ture as a whole."
Malloy said that while organiz-
ers engaged in discussion about
how to prevent larger scale events
like the "Hood Ratchet" party,
the ILC is more focused on com-
bating day-to-day micro-aggres-
sions and promoting thoughtful
language.
"A lot of what students expe-
rience on campus are little
comments or phrases that
they overhear in class or just
when they're walking by that
are also triggering that maybe
don't receive as much attention
because they just happen in pass-
ing," Malloy said. "ILC is a great
program because it will improve
the day-to-day language of stu-
dents on campus by providing
education around words that are
offensive."
McCullough said the campaign
isreachingouttothestudentbody
by encouraging students to share
their experiences with hurtful
language. Students can fill out
postcards with thought bubbles
that start a potential sentence
with, "Would you... If you knew..."
Organizers hope to feature about
250 of the cards on a clothesline
in the Michigan Union later this

month.
"We want to elevate peo-
ple's voices and experiences,"
McCullough said. "It's this whole
idea about how our words and
our actions contribute to a larger
campus climate and a campus
culture. We want to highlight the
connection between our words
and actions in promoting inclu-
sivity."
Harper, the vice president of
student life, said programs like
the ILC break down discussions
of inclusive language to the basics
of what it means to be human.
"We have to be able to con-
nect with compassion to a
greater degree in this culture,"
McCullough said. "That means
going into the hard places of
wanting to learn about the truths
that other people hold and then
explore, with honestly, our own
truths as well. I think that in
order to do that we have to not
just have diversity in numbers,
but spaces and cultures that seek
to learn about other people's
realities in an honest and inquir-
ing way. That to me is our biggest
challenge, but also our oppor-
tunity to be positioned to form
genuine bonds across lines of dif-
ference."
Change it Up!
Launched this year, Change it
Up! is a bystander intervention
program designed to equip stu-
dents with the skills needed to
intervene in situations that are
harmful, hateful, disrespectful
and potentially unsafe. The pro-
gram is mandatory for first-year
students.
Will Sherry, interim director
of the Spectrum Center, said that
while many programs and stu-
dent organizations discuss diver-

sity, inclusion and social justice,
there wasn't a program focused
on introductory skills where stu-
dents could understand and learn
how to promote campus inclusiv-
ity.
"One of the strengths is that
the Change it Up! program is so
connected to other initiatives
going on around campus that
really seek to develop a more
inclusive campus," he said. "The
more students, faculty, grad stu-
dents, staff, everyone, are hear-
ing similar messages and similar
techniques, the more change we
will see."
About 100 students attend each
90-minute session, which empha-
sizes how students come from
different backgrounds and must
widen their perspectives about
the people around them.
"Some things that make us
feel different are not the same
as things that make other people
feel different," he said. "It is our
responsibility as community
members to being to notice things
that are going on in our residence
halls and our classrooms that
affect other people that maybe
don't affect us."
The workshop partners with
the University Educational The-
atre Company to use interactive
performances to coach students
how to approach offensive situ-
ations through direct interven-
tion, distraction, delegation, or
by delaying confrontation if the
environment is unsafe.
Nursing freshman Hannah
Glanzman said the course might
have been more helpful if it fur-
ther discussed how to prevent
situations rather than how to
approach them once they hap-
pen.
"It didn't make me feel more
comfortable to intervene in awk-

ward situations when things are
going wrong," Glanzman said.
"I'm still nervous to do that. I
don't know if you can just make
people more comfortable."
The program is still new and
has only completed roughly 15 of
the 65 workshops slated to run
this semester, but Sherry said so
far much of the feedbackhas been
positive.
"I absolutely do believe the
program has an impact," Sherry
said. "That impact can affect
campus climate in that microag-
gressions can be reduced so the
many spaces in which students
are hearing and feeling messages
that who they are doesn't belong
based on the language other
people are using, the way other
people are engaging them or the
costumes that people are wearing
for Halloween. Those things can
be reduced based on a program
like this setting a standard that,
at the beginningof your first year,
talks about some of the cultural
values at the University of Michi-
gan and some skills to enact those
values."
Public Policy junior Hattie
McKinney, BSU co-programming
chair, said that while the Univer-
sity has been working to address
create a more inclusive campus
climate, it will take time to see
whether these efforts are effec-
tive.
"I feel that the University is
working with a diverse group of
students on campus to address
the concerns that were brought
up last year and to do all that it
can to change the climate on
campus," McKinney said. "Any-
thing of good.quality takes time
and it's definitely not an over-
night thing."


OBAMA
From Page 2A
million dollars or a nickel," Stabe-
now said. "Everybody has one vote
... and so it's up tous to show up and
take back our great state."
A slate of statewide candi-
dates who spoke during the rally
highlighted multiple aspects of
the Republican record over the
past four years as having a nega-

tive impact on the state, including
changes to education funding and
the passage of Right to Work laws
in2012.
"If you're a student or a teacher,
(Snyder's policies) aren't working
for you," Schauer said. "If you're a
parent, or a senior, or a union mem-
ber, they're not working for you.
If you're a woman, or a member of
the LGBT community, if you care
about livable cities and protecting
our Great Lakes, theyare not work-
ing for you. I thinkthat's wrong.

That's why Michigan's ready for
change and friends, that's why
change is coming."
During his remarks, Obama
spoke to both nationwide and
statewide concerns in the context
of change, focusing on, income
inequality issues such as pay equi-
ty, raising the minimum wage and
the middle class.
"More tax breaks for folks at the
top. Less investment in education.
Looser rules on bigbanks and cred-
it card companies and polluters. A

thinner safety net for folks when
they fall on hard times. You know
what - we've tried those things,"
Obama said of GOP economic poli-
cies. "They don't work."
In addition to urging change, he
also embraced another one his for-
mer campaign slogans: encourag-
ing those present to avoid cynicism
and to continue embracing hope.

"Cynicism is a choice;" Obama
said. "And hope is a better choice
... hope that we can rebuild our
middle class and pass on to our
kids something better. That's what
built America. That's what Motor
City is all about. That's what built
Michigan! Our best days are still
ahead."
Republicans, who are attempt-

ing to gain control of the U.S. Sen-
ate this election cycle, have been
turning up in Michigan as well.
Last month, former presidential
candidate Mitt Romney hosted a
rally in Livonia in support of Land,
criticizing the Obama administra-
tion on a slew of campaign issues,
including national security and
health care reform.



HACKETT
From Page 1A
experience in heading a complex
organization to his interim role
here.
"I am also very impressed
with his interpersonal skills, and
his longstanding commitment to
serving the university."
Steelcase reported a $70 mil-
lion loss in 1994, but Hackett
quickly steered the firm back
into safer waters. His moves
weren't always free of criticism,
though, especially after major
downsizing actions that included
a 2011 decision to shutter three
factories. Jobs from one of those
factories were later moved to a
facility in Mexico.

While at Steelcase, Hackett
oversaw the initial public offer-
ing of company stock, which
doubled in value in the last five
years after a rough first decade
of trading.
Hackett was a teammate of
Brandon's on the 1973 Michi-
gan football team, which was
Bo Schembechler's fifth year as
Michigan's head coach. A line-
backer, Hackett's freshman year
coincided with Brandon's senior
season.
"I'd like to thank Dave Bran-
don for his commitment to
Michigan," Hackett said. "I have
a tremendous amount of respect
for him and thank him again for
an extraordinary commitment to
this university."
Hackett cited the strong
financial footing of the Athletic

Department and growth in var-
sity sports offerings as reasons
Michigan can continue to be a
destination program, and went
out of his way to indicate that
two of his all-time heroes are
Michigan legends.
"My time as a student at Mich-
igan introduced me to two peo-
ple who would become lifelong
heroes of mine," Hackett said.
"Early on, there was Bo Schem-
bechler. The other was President
Gerald Ford, whom I met later in
his life after he retired from pub-
lic office. Both of them would be
quite certain that the future of
Michigan is not in doubt."
Schlissel was clear in indi-
cating that Hackett's role is an
interim one only, and that the
University will proceed with a
search for a long-term candidate.

A principled tradition
The University must focus on morals in new athletic director
tandingintheRegentsRoomintheFlemingAdministration
Building on Friday, University President Mark Schlissel
announced the resignation of Athletic Director Dave
Brandon. Brandon's resignation comes on the heels of a slew of
controversial events and decisions that led to public outcry from
students and alumni alike. As the athletic director, Brandon was
rarely able to genuinely connect with or understand Michigan
fans, often implementing shortsighted policies and marketing
tactics that betrayed the core beliefs of the school. Brandon's
justified departure presents an opportunity for President
Schlissel and the University to realign the Athletic Department
with the school's foundational traditions and values of a strong
moral code, academic excellence and tradition of athletic success.

The Michigan Daily --michigandaily.com
FROM THE DAILY
Taylor, White, Weiser and Schauer
:us on issues that impact students, the Daily endorses four candidates
ipcoming Nov. 4 election has the potential to change politics
 on and off campus. Tuesday's ballot will cover a host of issues
tingto students, includingthe election oftwo Universityregents,
Arbor mayor and a hotly contested election for state governor.
en seems like elections are a topic with little everyday impact,
>uld pay attention to local and state elections. Basic services
costs are influenced by the future mayor, while University
:isions are made by the Board of Regents. Similarly, all Michigan
ill be affected by the gubernatorial election. Because there
at stake,students must pay attention to the issues and make
cisions Tuesday.

While much of the public outrage toward
Brandon was due to the football team's poor
performance on the field, the heart of student
and alumni discontent wasbased onthe appar-
ent disintegration of Michigan's values. Dur-
ing Brandon's tenure, the Athletic Department
mishandled a number of critical incidents, a
reflection of the department's failure to pri-
oritize basic University principles. On Nov. 23,
2013,former MichigankickerBrendanGibbons
was allowed to play in a game against Iowa
despite the fact that three days prior Gibbons
had been found responsible for an violating
the University's Student Sexual Misconduct
Policy. At best this was a communication fail-
ure, and at worst it was a willful disregard
for the ethical standards of the University. In
the Sept. 27 football game against Minnesota,
after Michigan sophomore quarterback Shane
Morris suffered a concussion on the field he
was allowed to reenter the game. Though the
incident seemed to be an accident of ignorance .
- another breakdown in communication,
apparently - the fact remains that the policy
in place failed to protect student-athletes.
Rather than reinforcing player safety
policies or the personal conduct of its student-
athletes (see former Michigan offensive
lineman Taylor Lewan's alleged physical
assault in addition to Gibbons')upontakingthe
athletic director position, Brandon appeared to

prioritize the gimmicky marketing strategies
of a profit-driven agenda; effectively brushing
aside the virtues of a "Michigan Man." From
raising football ticket prices, to the accidental
Coca-Cola ticket giveaway promotion, to the
skywriting incident, Brandon's marketing
decisions were a series of rather impulsive
ideas or mistakes from which he backtracked
following public disapproval. The University
cannot afford another athletic director with
such misaligned values.
All of which is to say the University needs
to better integrate the Athletic Department
into its overall mission. In addition to choosing
a principled athletic director, Schlissel has to
find a balance between an efficient delegation
of responsibilities and sufficient oversight to
ensure that the Athletic Department is an exten-
sion of University virtues. Learning from Bran-
don's mistakes, the next Athletic Director needs
to focus on student-athlete safety, player behav-
ior and connecting with alumni and students.
Michigan's storied history is a winning
one - especially in football - but it's not the
scoreboard from which students and alumni
draw their pride. Michigan tradition is defined
by morals, not money; the team, not the brand.
By forgoing profits, wins or skywriting in
exchange for ethical behavior in the Athletic
Department, President Schlissel can continue
to maintain that proud tradition.

For the first time in 14 years, Ann
Arbor will elect a new mayor to
servethecity'sresidents.AnnArbor
City Councilmember Christopher
Taylor (D-Ward 3) is running
against independent candidate
Bryan Kelly in this year's mayoral
election. Taylor's platform relies
partially on reinforcing strategies
that current Mayor John Hieftje
(D) has utilized in the past. Taylor
is a strong advocate for expanding
public transit, increasing outreach
to students and initiating change in
downtown development and zoning
districts. While Kelly has noted the
importance of restructuring our
development infrastructure, his
platform is focused on the city's
debt, especially pension debt and
health care.
While it's clear that Kelly is
passionate about the city and its
people, his visible lack of experience
is a red flag for voters. With the
city's focus currently on the
Downtown Development Authority
and expansion of public transit
and related services, The Michigan
Daily Editorial Board endorses
CHRISTOPHER TAYLOR for
mayor. However, honorable mention
is given to independent candidate
Bryan Kelly for his obvious passion
and investment in the city's issues,
and his initiative to reach out
and connect with students. Kelly
should continue his political career
and with future experience, he
will hopefully prove to be a great
candidate for the city.
In the race for two seats on the
University's Board of Regents,
four candidates have become the
frontrunners: Mike Behm, Rob
Steele, Ronald Weiser and Katherine
White. Of the four, the Daily
endorses KATHERINE WHITE
and RONALD WEISER. White,
the current chair of the Board of
Regents, has maintained a strong

relationship with the student body
throughout her terms, including the
reporters at the Daily. White has
previously said she endorseslowering
tuition for students as well as
increasing minority enrollment and
diversifying campus. With a strong
background in higher education and
advocacy for diversity on campus,
White is an excellent choice for
the board.
Newcomer Ronald Weiser
is a University alum, a former
ambassador to the Slovak Republic
and the founder and CEO of
multimillion-dollar real estate
firm McKinley Associates. Weiser
has demonstrated his dedication
to the community. His service on
the board for the Detroit Institute
of Arts shows his dedication to
the arts, which is encouraging for
the University as he emphasizes
greater funding for non-specialized
programs. Weiser believes his
background in business can help
the University better manage its
funds, especially with regard to
responsible budgeting and lowering
student tuition. On diversity issues,
Weiser plans to increase diversity
by lowering tuition and improving
accessibility. Weiser, who has strong
ties to the Ross School of Business,
must focus on all parts of the
University in order to be successful.
The 2014 gubernatorial election
pits incumbent Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder against former U.S. Rep.
Mark Schauer. The decision was
difficult, as the editorial board had
reservations with some of the stances
of both candidates on different issues.
Though the course of the state
economy has trended positively
during Snyder's term, his policies,
such as the elimination of the
Michigan Business Tax, tax
reforms and elimination of various
tax credits for individuals that
mostly affected the middle and

lower class and introduction of
taxed pensions, have delivered
good, but not sensational, results at
the expense of the aforementioned
raises in personal taxes. Education
funding, while initially cut under
the Snyder administration, has
trended upward over the past
four years, but his plans for
more educational choice have
spawned charter schools that lack
oversight. His role in the Detroit
bankruptcy proceedings and the
Grand Bargain were instrumental,
but his pro-fracking and other
environmental and energy stances
lack the progressivism we wish
to see. Snyder also continues to
dodge questions on social issues,
and it's difficult to figure out where
he stands.
Meanwhile, Schauer says a lot of
the right things, but lacks details
on how he would implement his
ideas. He wishes to reinstate tax
credits for lower- and middle-
class individuals and eliminate the
pension tax, as well as repeal Right
to Work legislation. However, his
general proposals such as cutting
waste and expanding the tax base
do not specifically answer how he
would achieve the increased revenue
needed to accomplish things like
substantially increasing education
funding, rendering his plans
idealistic. He says he would not have
instituted an emergency manager in
Detroit, but hasn't provided details
on how he would have dealt with the
situation differently.
However, Schauer sets himself
apart from Snyder with his stance
on social issues, his progressive
environmental goals and his
vision for education in the state.
The Michigan Daily has a strong
precedent of placing importance
on these issues, therefore, we
endorse MARK SCHAUER
for governor.

Exactly the right time

CAROLINE SEMRAU I
Vote yes on annexation

Before Friday, Michigan's midterm elec-
tions seemed primed to be the story of
the week. Then former Athletic Director
Dave Brandon turned heads_
one last time, resigning his
office, and suddenly, the gov-
ernor's post seems secondary.
compared to the still-warm w
but newly empty chair of the
athletic director at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. Â°
Normally it would be TYLER
cheeky to suggest the oust- SCOTT
ing of an athletic director at a
single university trumps the
importance of a changing of
the guard of the state's highest political office,
but timing is everything.
With each progressive controversy, the
question of what exactly it would take to get
Dave Brandon fired mid-season was asked with
increasing regularity. In the end, whether it was
the botched handling of Shane Morris-gate,
the ineptitude of the highest-profile athletic
team or just the mounting public pressure Dave
Brandonisnowgone - somethingthatstudents
should be proud of.
Tirelessly, the mantra of the "leaders and
best" is preached, but even in this liberal haven,
most dramatic illustrations of student activism
elicit a response that can only be measured by
how likely a passerby is to actively avoid the
Diag on demonstration day.
After the misery of the Minnesota game on
Sept. 27, organizers of the protest to have Dave
Brandon run out of town seized the perfect
time to voice the growing discontent. Hundreds
gathered around the heart of campus and the
media were there to listen. Students - the most
faithful followers of the once-great Michigan
Wolverines - were seemingly more fed up than
anyone.
Poor Mark Schlissel. Not even a semester
into his tenure as University President, and
hordes of angry students were literally out call-

ing for change from the front steps of his home.
The decision sat with Schlissel, but the protest
made national news. It wasn't that the evening
on the Diag caused any change directly, even
with the news chopper whirling overhead. But
it evoked frustration with the status quo and
put Dave Brandon in the middle of a nightmare,
albeit one that looked escapable.
There seemed for a moment to be a glimmer
of hope for Brandon. Next year's student
football ticket prices were slashed, excitement
about the upcoming basketball and hockey
seasons quelled some woes, and Michigan
finally won again - at home, under the lights,
with proud and elated players.
It was all a cruel coincidence. A loss at
Michigan State on Oct. 25 reincarnated the
dismay, and the University's Board of Regents
began to put serious pressure on Brandon.
Perhaps the left-leaning board was happy to
excusably berate the staunchly conservative
corporate pizza man, and perhaps much of
what transpires on the football field doesn't fall
directly on the athletic director.
It should be said that Brandon did some great
things for the University. Chiefly, the state-of-
the-art facilities for many of the athletic teams
and clubs should come to mind, but the timing
was all wrong. Once this season began its disap-
pointing course, Brandon never had a chance.
To claim that students had some hand in the
resignation of Brandon may be overreaching.
A lot of degrees, experience and money go
into making decisions of such magnitude.
Nevertheless, the entire ordeal would have had
a different feel were it not for the protest on the
Diag that fans and media members alike often
referred to.
For once, it at least feels like the student voice
meant something, that it made a difference by
providing a key outlet of discontent - and at
exactly the right time.

Perseveranceisputtingfortheffort
through difficult times. Last month,
Whitmore Lake students focused on
the character trait of perseverance,
They learned that perseverance is
important throughout life.
Perhaps unknown to these stu-
dents, their own school district is
tryingto persevere in providing high-
qualitysustainable education despite
continued inadequate funding from
state government. Whitmore Lake
is not alone. The Ann Arbor public
schools struggle to maintain excel-
lence in the face of state reductions to
support classroom teaching.
These two school districts are
proposing an innovative, joint
approach in their tenacious battle.
Both districts support the annexation
of the Whitmore Lake public schools
into the Ann Arbor public schools.
Annexation will be on your ballot
Tuesday as the Ann Arbor Schools
Proposal. It deserves our support.
The future of our children depends
on a "yes" vote.
For the last eight years, I have
had the pleasure of teaching
Whitmore Lake children. As an
Ann Arbor resident of 12 years, I
compare the resources at our Ann
Arbor neighborhood school to the
limited Whitmore Lake offerings: no
elementary art, limited AP courses,
only Spanish in high school. How is
it that students, only a few minutes
north of Ann Arbor, are the casualties
of a political decision made before
their births?
Proposal A, implemented in 1995,
centralized control of school funds
at the state level. A foundation allow-
ance, or the appropriation per pupil,
was allotted based on enrollment.

The foundation allowance of each
district reflected its spending prior to
Proposal A. Ann Arbor students cur-
rently get $9,100 per student while
Whitmore Lake students receive
only $7,126 because of the patterns
and policies of over two decades ago.
Annexation is a local, proactive
solution that benefits students in
both districts. After annexation, all
students in the expanded district
wouldreceiveafoundationallowance
of $9,095 per student. This allowance
includes an ongoing annual state
appropriation of an additional $100
per student to districts choosing
annexation. With the nearly 18,000
students in both districts, the added
$100 per student would yield $1.8
million annually.
Each district must, by law, have
its own superintendent and board of
education. Each district must also
have central administrative services
such as business services and human
resource departments to fulfill its
educational and fiduciary respon-
sibilities. Annexation would lead to
the elimination of a superintendent
and other duplicative services. The
consolidation of central adminis-
trative seryices would cut costs by
$500,000. These savings would
dwarf the $5 decline noted above for
the Ann Arbor foundation allowance.
The sum of the $1.8 million in
recurring revenue and the $500,000
reduction in administrative costs
yields a total of $2.3 million of new
annual support for instruction. In
addition, the state is offering a one-
time grant of $1.4 million to offset
costs related to the annexation.
The annexation of Whitmore Lake
would attract students back to the

Whitmore Lake schools and attract
School of Choice students from a
broader geographic area. It would
further lower central administra-
tive costs per student and increase
the proportion of the state, appro-
priation devoted to instruction. The
Ann Arbor superintendent and the
Board of Education are pursuing this
policy now. Incorporating Whitmore
Lake into this plan would open up
possibilities of new educational pro-
grams, such as language immersion,
STEAM, magnet schools and Inter-
national Baccalaureate programs,
which benefit students as well as
attract them. The Whitmore Lake
District would become a neighbor-
hood attendance area analogous to
those of Huron, Pioneer and Sky-
line. The geographic area of sus-
tainable, excellent public education
would increase.
The ability to think creatively
allows people and, in this case,
districts to persevere. The current
system of funding schools is broken.
If we wait for elected state officials to
fix the problems, more students will
have gaps in their education. Instead,
this annexation proposal allows two
districts to take a stand and work
through the funding situation so the
education of our students will not
suffer. Together, Whitmore Lake
and Ann Arbor will be a model of
strength, unity and perseverance.
Our community will model the traits
we teach our students. Vote yes on
the Ann Arbor Schools Proposal
for annexation.

Arbor resident and a teacher in the

5A - Monday, November 3, 2014The Michigan Daily - michigandailycom

Let's talk about sex

"I'm not wearing hockey pads."
Dark, satirical
'B irdman soars

Wait, Danny, Danny
that doesn't go
there."
On the Oct. 7episode of "The
Mindy Project," Mindy and Danny
did something
they had
never done
before - and
it made televi-
sion history.
As the camera
held its posi-
tion outside ALEC
the bedroom, STERN
Mindy and
Danny's esca-
pade echoed. Danny's response
(and also the title of the episode):
"I slipped."'
It was the "I slipped" heard
'round the world. OK, "The Mindy
Project" remains one of the lowest
rated shows on television, so it was
more like the "I slipped" heard
'round The Michigan Daily Arts
desk. But regardless, Mindy and
Danny did make TV history. Their
sex scene - and the remainder
of the episode, which focused on
the true motive behind said "slip"
- was the first time anal sex had
been so pervasive on an episode of
broadcast television. And just one
week later, another series picked
up where "Mindy" left off. In the
fourthepisode ofABC's"Howto
Get Away with Murder," "Let's
Get to Scooping," a character
proclaims, "He did somethingto
my ass that made my eyes water,"
immediately following a graphic
sex scene.
That's right: in a year that will
already be remembered for the
media's infatuation with rear-
ends (thanks in no small partto
Nicki Minaj, J.Lo and Iggy Aza-
lea), anal sex is becoming one of
fall TV's latest trends. But "The
Mindy Project" and "Murder" are
just two instances of the recent
attemptsto push the boundaries
of what's acceptable on broadcast
television.
To be clear, even the discussion
ofsexofanykind onbroadcast
should already be considered a
decisive victory, especially when
you realizethat Lucille Ball
couldn'teven saythe word "preg-
nant" on "I Love Lucy" in the
1950s - CBS deemed it too vulgar
for the network. And even today,

broadcast television remains one
of the most highly regulated forms
of entertainment, the kind of
regulation thatcontinues to deter
top talent from"The Big Four"
networks.
On premium cable networks
like HBO or Showtime, you expect
sex. You pay for it. HBO and
Showtime even still have their
own pornographic programming,
so it'sno surprise when boobs
show up on "Game of Thrones"
or when Joan Cusack and Wil-
liam H. Macy engage in their own
exploration of the derriere on
"Shameless." Broadcast networks
are inherently different. They're
free networks still operating in
the shadow of1950s decency stan-
dards and a history of catering to
the wholesome American family.
"How to Get Away with Murder"
shares a network with "America's
Funniest Home Videos" and just
last week, "Grey's Anatomy" was
preempted in the 8 p.m. hour for
"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie
Brown," as if the two are inter-
changeable.
But broadcast television's insis-
tence on pushing the envelope is
a reaction (a desperate reaction?)
to their diminished influence and
viewership. If you ask ten people
to name their favorite show,
it's almost assured that every
response will be a cable series,
which is exactly what happened
when I did - "House of Cards,"
"Mad Men," "The Americans,"
"The Newsroom," "Californica-
tion," etc. (The onlynon-cable
favorite was alone "New Girl.")
There's no way around it: sex sells.
But it's not just sex. Cable affords
viewers the gritty, sexy, violent,
fun escapism they look for. And
because broadcast television is
no longer the omnipresent, only-
option for consumers, isn't it time
we rethink network standards?
Recently, that's exactly what
has happened. In addition to
pushingthe amountof explicit
content in its series - hence, the
anal sex TV movementof2014
- broadcast networks have even
begun to formally change the dia-
logue. In 2013, FOX filed a 42-page
comment atthe FCC urgingthat
the agency "cease attempting to
enforce broadcast indecency lim-
its once and for all." In fact, every

broadcast network has lodged
complaints that the current inde-
cency rules are archaic. "Ameri-
cans today, including children,
spend more time engaged with
non-broadcast channels delivered
by cable and satellitetelevision,
the Internetvideo games and
other mediathan they do with
broadcast media."
Broadcast television's increased
propensity to show sex - all kinds
of sex - is nothing more than a
product of the current television
landscape. But that doesn't dimin-
ish the magnitude of its presence.
On "How to Get Away with Mur-
der" sex is one of the series' defin-
ing characteristics, as prominent
as the law or criminality or Viola
Davis - the pilot episode features
both cunnilingus and not-so-
subtly suggests other similar sex
acts. In a later episode, Davis con-
fronts her cheating husband with
the question, "Why is your penis
on a dead girl's phone?" (Those
#lastninewords were trending the
night the episode premiered) On
the most recentepisode of"Scan-
dal," Olivia dreams of having sex
with both Fitz and Jake in a scene
reminiscent of another explicit
broadcast drama, the artfully
directed double sex scene from
the second season of "Hannibal."
Evenon "Black-ish," aso-called
family comedy, Rainbow points
downward while her husband
asks if she's going to sneak him
in the Underground Railroad.
(Think about it..)
Sex - onanynetwork -=has
undoubtedly become a foundation
of television in the modern age,
and no matter the vice, broadcast
television networks have always
challenged the powers of the FCC.
But we're at a strange point now,
as of the last few weeks, where
you can talk about anal sex - or
strongly suggestit visually - but
you can'tsay the word "asshole"
or "blow job" or "Christ" (as an
expletive). The bottom line: net-
work standards are reaching a
breakingpoint.
Sex sells, and broadcast televi-
sion is just trying to get in on the
action.

subject, he's just writing a column

Iinrritu's black
comic tour de
force never
0 stops moving,
By CATHERINE SULPIZIO
Daily Arts Writer
The camera in Alejandro
Gonzalez Inirritu's "Birdman
or (The Unexpected Virtue of
Innocence)"
never stops A
moving, even
to pause on Birdman
the actors,
who, too, are Michigan
restless. They Theater
glide between Fox Searchlight
stage and
dressing room
at such dizzyingspeed that it's
no wonder the line between
fiction and reality eventually'
collapses. At the center of the
cinematic vortex is Riggan
Thomson (Michael Keaton,
"Beetlejuice"), a washed up
star whose better days are
haunting him, literally, in
the form of his bombastic
superhero alter-ego cum
Freudian super-ego, Birdman.
The cinematic tour de force
is generated by Emmanuel
Lubezki's ("Gravity")
exquisite camerawork,
which hovers and breathes
like an extra character. Its
cleverness intrudes a few
times, but for the most part
it adds integral dimension
to an already multilayered
story. "Birdman" attempts to
create a single-take shot (it's
subtly threaded together) and
is mostly confined to the St.
James theater in New York,
creating a claustrophobic,
distinctly play-like
atmosphere: the actors give
monologues dressed up as
aired grievances, the lighting
bleeds from ethereal blue to
angry red, the minimalist
soundtrack releases a pit-pat
of drums and orchestra at
opportune moments, mostly
drawing taut silence. There
is a gun that obeys Chekov's
Rule.
After all, it's a self-aware
film, equal parts industry-
skewering satire and meta-
drama. "Birdman" follows
Thomson as he attempts to
claim some artistic prestige
by adapting, directing and
starring in Raymond Carver's
"What They Talk About
When They Talk About Love,"
in the recent tradition of
Hollywood stars storming
the Broadway stage. Much
of the movie's momentum is

driven by Carver's short story,
a tale about the delusional
acts people equate with love
and the hazy line between
requited love and self-
identity. Indeed, the cast
of the play is less a unified
system than a frenetic throng
of individual motivations and
egos, concerned more with
good reviews than Raymond's
compact dialogue. Such
is the self-serving nature
of all creative projects,
and "Birdman" offers a
psychological portrait of the
objet d'art.
In the days before opening,
Thomson attempts to fight off
his Hollywood past - replete
with CGI and thunderous
explosions, as well as the
looming reception of the
play, on which his career and
financial stability rest. That
would be too manageable,
though, so his ex-wife,
maybe pregnant girlfriend,
uncooperative lead actor
and recently rehab-released
daughter get crammed
in, in the claustrophobic,
metaphoric way only stage
plays can pull off (though
"Birdman" is the immediate
cinematic exception).
And for all its density, in
the two times I saw it, I was
astonished by the meticulous
way it barrels through and
around itself like a Lynchian
ouroboros - doubling
abounds in the film, on stage,
backstage, with dialogue and
characterization, In one scene
an actor asks Thomson what
he thinks of his overblown
monologue, and in the tail end
of the movie a homeless person
recites the famous sound and
fury "Macbeth" monologue
before asking Thomson for the
same feedback word for word.
Combined with the
telekinetic powers Thomson
may or may not have, as well
as a detour into slick action
genre, makes the viewing a
marvelous puzzle. Notably,
though, its formalist delights
are also fortified with
compelling performances.
Michael Keaton's rendition
as a nervous-wrecked actor
is astounding - watch his
eyes through the film which
mirror the camera's feverish
gaze. Incredibly entertaining
is Edward Norton ("Fight
Club"), who plays the
recalcitrant actor with the
kind of emasculated hyper-
masculinity of his former
imaginary friend Tyler
Durden. Indeed other actors'
characters echo old roles too:
Naomi Watts' ("21 Grams")

Broadway neophyte Lesley is
a slightly grittier version of
her Betty from "Mulholland
Drive." Zach Galifianakis as
the exasperated best friend/
lawyer reminds the viewer he
has serious acting chops.
The least successful acting
is done by Emma Stone ("The
Help"), whose character,
Sam, intentionally or
unintentionally falls prey to
the fragile, damaged ingenue
trope, which is simply dull.
Another character, New
York Times theater critic
Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan,
"Rome") is more satirical than
dynamic, but Duncan's barbed
commitment makes up for it.
Along those lines, despite -
or rather, because of - its dark
subject matter, "Birdman"
is raked with fantastic,
vicious humor. Up until the
syncopated closing credits,
"Birdman" refuses to stay
its furious pace. The movie
is a dizzying force of sharp
writing and even sharper
cinematography and acting.

Demands on MWireless
see 'U' upgrading Wi-Fi

Business senior Amber Blanks and LSA senior Canon Thomas celebrate their crowning as Ms. Maize and Mr. Blue at
Black Homecoming Saturday.
Black Homecoming honors
student leadership, impact

15th annual event
assumes 'Harlem
Renaissance' theme
By PARISHA NOVA
For the Daily
Inside the Michigan Union's
Rogel Ballroom, participants in
the annual Mr. Blue contest were
asked a series of questions.
"If you could tell yourself
something at any age, what
would you tell yourself?" one
organizer asked.
"I would go to a time when
'I was younger and tell myself
about trying, attempting and
being courageous, never having
fear, never having regrets, about
living my dreams to the fullest,"
LSA senior Canon Thomas said.
"Because when I put forward my
passion and mytenacity I will be
successful."
Thomas would go on to win
Mr. Blue, which is awarded to one
student who is making a positive
difference in their community.
Mr. Blue is just one part of the
celebrations associated with the

annual Black Homecoming, held
Saturday evening. Organized by
the student groups H.E.A.D.S.
- Here Earning a Destiny
through Honesty, Eagerness,
and Determination of Self - and
Sister 2 Sister, "Resurgence:
The Harlem Renaissance" was
the theme celebrating the 15th
annual semi-formal event, which.
also included an official after-
party that nightin the Biomedical
Science Research Building.
Kinesiology senior Fitz
Tavernier, H.E.A.D.S. chairman
and president, wrote in an e-mail
interview that the event's theme
was meant to highlight African
American art, music and dance
during the 1920s.
"It represented a time period
that fosters black pride and
uplifting of race through the use
of intellect," he wrote.
Tavernier also wrote that the
crowning of Mr. Blue and Ms.
Maize at Black Homecoming, an
honor historically bestowed on
two members of the senior class,
was meant to highlight students
who "made strides to enhance
the school community, bring
about social awareness, while

also achieving high academic
success."
Participants in the
competition went through an
elaborate application process,
which included writing several
essays. Throughout the event,
votes were taken and the winners
of the titles were announced
toward the end of the event.
Business senior Amber
Blanks, who won this year's Ms.
Maize title, said the contest is
about being a leader who can
make a positive impact in the
community. It is also about
being recognized by peers
in the community for one's
contributions.
In addition to celebrating the
achievements and contributions
of current students with the
Mr. Blue and Ms. Maize titles,
organizers aimed for Saturday's
event to increase the depth and
breadth of student involvement
in creating positive changes
across campus and the greater
community.

Current $3.6 million
project phase to
be completed by
Summer 2015
By MAYA KALMAN
Daily StaffReporter
This past weekend marked
a significant milestone in the
ongoing Campus Wi-Fi Upgrade
Project. As of Saturday at 3 p.m.,
all Wi-Fi access points in 19 pub-
lic buildings were transferred
over to an updated system in
order to improve the experience
of those using wireless networks
on campus.'
In recent years, students, fac-
ulty and staff have experienced
slow Internet connections while
using MWireless, the primary
wireless network on campus, due
to both increased traffic on the
networks and increased usage of
technologies that take up a large
amount of the Wi-Fi bandwidth.
Wi-Fi, which uses unlicensed
spectrum, can be used by anyone
with an enabled device, causing
high traffic volumes in the small
bits of bandwidth allocated to
Wi-Fi. Andrew Palms, executive
director of the University's Com-
munications Systems and Data
Centers, compared heavy traffic
to having multiple people talk at
once.
"From a technical perspec-
tive, that's like four of us all talk-
ing at the same time," Palmssaid.
"All of a sudden it doesn't work
and you can't understand any-
one because we're all talking at
once. If you take all four of us
and you separate us out 100 feet
and then we start talking, some-
body could understand each of
us individually. That's a lot like
what unlicensed spectrum is. If
you have a lot of folks who are
implementing Wi-Fi and they're
all implementing it and talking
at the same time, it creates a bad
situation."
The core problemis that Wi-Fi
can only run on three small bits
of spectrum, which are now
becoming overcrowded.
"It's like oceanfront proper-
ty," Palms said. "There's only so
much of it."
The increased use of wireless
devices on campus over a short
period of time is a major driver of
the problem. From January 2012

to January 2013, the number of
devices connecting to MWireless
has nearly doubled, according to
Patricia Giorgio, marketing com-
munication specialist senior at
the University's Information and
Technology Services.As aresult,
ITS has struggled to stay in front
of that growth.
"The wireless was fine and
suitable for the amount of devic-
es students, faculty and, staff
were bringing on campus at the
time it was built. But the prob-
lem is, we've all become more
of a digital population," Giorgio
said. "The more people that try
to connect to an access point, the
slower the traffic will move and
the performance of the wireless
becomes degraded."
This problem extends past the
University to large institutions
across the country.
The problem has been exacer-
bated by interruptions to the net-
work by other Wi-Fi networks
on campus. The use of personal
hotspots and wireless printers
that broadcast their own sig-
nals interferes heavily with the
MWireless enterprise network.
This effectexplains why the Uni-
versity requeststhat students not
set up their own access points in
their dorms.
Another contributor to the
problem is the change in how
devices are used. Specifically, the
increase in video streaming has
been a huge driver of the chal-
lenges.
"The biggest bandwidth hog,
so to speak, is streaming video,"
Giorgio said. "And, as you know,
students, faculty and staff are all
doing a lot more with streaming
video. So it's not only the num-
ber of devices, but it's the type of
devices."
Finally, the problems are
greatest in buildings with older
wiring and electronics, which
further slow the network.
In the face of these prob-
lems, which were identified by
students, University Provost
Martha Pollack and ITS have
developed the Campus Wi-Fi
Update Project. The project,
which began last year, aims to
increase the quality of the wire-
less network on campus by both
increasing the number of access
points in buildings and by raising
the spectrum at which the net-
work runs.
The priority placed on this
project was raised dramatically

directly in response to student
requests, Palms said. And other
facultymembers agreed.
"I hear from students it's
water, food and Wi-Fi - that's
what they want, maybe not
even in that order," said Susan
Pile, director of the Michigan
Union and the Center for Cam-
pus Involvement. "I think Wi-Fi
enables students to, certainly,
have an enhanced academic
experience, but from a student
life perspective, it's really part of
your Michigan experience."
Using the wireless network
has not been a seamless activity
previously. The goal of the proj-
ect was to improve the experi-
ence in heavily used campus
common spaces, Pile said.
The first phase of the proj-
ect, which took place last year,
involved upgrading libraries.
Due to the high wireless usage by
students in these buildings, the
University decided to upgrade
them first, costing approximately
$1.2 million.
The current phase of the proj-
ect, which will be completed
by summer 2015, began in the
Michigan Union, the Michigan
League and Pierpont Commons,
worth approximately $3.6 mil-
lion.
"I think that this will speak
volumes to students in terms of
the University making a move
of this nature to enhance their
experience, so it's great. We're
excited,"saidPierpontCommons
Director Michael Swanigan.
The first part, increasing
the number of access 'points,
involves installing more devices
that amplify the wireless signal,
much like wireless routers. These
devices have now been installed
in more places than ever before,
increasing the number of rooms
in which Wi-Fi is available in all
included buildings. In addition,
all of the existing access points
have been replaced with upgrad-
ed devices.
The number of access points
added to each room is deter-
mined by the number of people
who typically use that room and
the type of technology being
used in the space. For example,
large lecture halls require more
access points to allow for wire-
less use by many students simul-
taneouslv.

FOOTBALL
In brief: 'D' stops Indiana

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
ManagingSports Editor
Before the ball was even
snapped, Jake Ryan knew
Indiana's play. He knew Tevin
Coleman, the Hoosiers' talented
running back, would get the ball.
And he knew exactly where to be
in order to stop him.
Ryan fought off a block to
knock the ball from Coleman's
arm, and the Michigan football
team recovered the fumble. The
Wolverines scored a touchdown
on the ensuing possession on
their way to a 34-10 win.
Despite Michigan's best
offensive showing of the year
against a Power 5 team, the
team's defense impressed most,
delivering its most complete
performance of the season. And
it all began with Ryan, the middle
linebacker, recognizing Indiana's
formation.
"It was a play that we had

designed for that specific thing
that they were doing," he said. "It
worked out perfectly.
"I think it was just preparing
for him and preparing for their
offensive scheme. Knowing what
play is goingto happen beforethe
play even starts is huge for us."
The Hoosiers finished
with just 191 offensive yards,
averaging 3.6 yards per play.
They were shut out for the first
36:29 of the game and didn't
score a touchdown until just
three minutes remained. Their
10 points marked the program's
lowest scoring output since Nov.
16, 2013.
The fumble recovery - one
of two on the day - wasn't
the Michigan defense's only
momentum-changing moment.
The unit also held Indiana
scoreless on a drive that began
in the red zone following Devin
Gardner's 10th interception of
the year.

That stand helped the
Wolverines reach halftime
with a 17-0 lead. And given that
Zander Diamont - a freshman
quarterback who started the year
third on the depth chart - was
under center, the Hoosiers never
threatened with a comeback.
"The guys up front, defensively
... you could feel those guys," said
Michigan * coach Brady Hoke.
"That helps our linebackers. That
helps the whole defense when
you getthat.
"It was really team defense....
Really, really think the kids went
out there and played hard."
The unit's only lapse came
late in the fourth quarter, when
Indiana engineered a nine-
play, 75-yard touchdown drive
consisting only of runs.
But by then, the stadium was
mostly empty, the game was
all but won and the Michigan
defense had established itself as
the game's most dominant unit.

JOHNSON

a dream of playing football.
He competed in the hurdles for
the Pioneersawith opportunities
to go nearly anywhere to continue
running.
But he came tothe same
place where he once roamed the
sideline from time to time, telling
the players then, "I'm goingto be
better than all of you."
His mom, Pam St. John,
the cheerleading coach atthe
University, hadbeen working
here before he was born. He
adored running backs like Mike
Hart, one of the reasons he chose
to wear Hart's number 20..
"Coming from being eight to
20 now and playing here, it'sjust,
like, insane," Johnson said. "It's
just insanethinkingnow I'm the
one playing."
So he worked through his ACL
injury in search of that moment.
He rehabbed for a year in which
his participation was limited in
spring practice and through the
summer. It wasn't until midway
through camp this year thathe
even felt comfortable taking hits.
"We've always thought he
was talented," said Michigan
coach Brady Hoke. "The thing
about Drake is that he's always
been very motivated and ahard
worker."
And before we see his reward
for workingthrough his injury
to leaping ontothe ledge by the
student section, we have totalk
about how he gothis chance.

We need to go back to Oct. 4 of.
this year, when starting running
backDerrickGreenwentoff with
an injury of his own, one that
would put him out for the rest
of the season. His injury gave
more time to De'Veon Smith and
Justice Hayes, and it meant Drak
Johnson might have a chance to
make an impact.
So he got his opportunity
Saturday, bursting for 18 yards on
his first carry. He was given the
ball four more times before he got
the ball at the 10-yard line in the
third quarter.
He received the ball and the.
hole on the line opened up as
if a gate to a driveway had just
swung open. He went through
untouched with the student
section directly in front of him,
until he caught someone "out of
the corner of (his) eye."
So he used that speed that he
had on the track to run through
the end zone, and he leapt -
with the same ability he used
while hurdling in high school -
in the direction of the student
section.
But he didn'tgettothe ledge,
not quite. We'll get to that later.
Instead, he stopped himself short
and came back down to celebrate
with his teammates.
"I was like, 'Youknow, this is
just another touchdown in high
school,' "Johnson said. "But this
wasn't just another touchdown
in high school. This really just
happened - in the Big House.
"As I was coming back down,
everyone was like 'Good job,
Drake.' But they only do that
when people score, so I just

scored."
He'd go on to score once
more, steppingover adefender
on his way to the end zone,
as he rushed for 123 yards
on 16 attempts. Johnson had
previously rushed for 41 total
e yards all season.
For 4running game thatlooked
stagnant and struggled, his
emergence brought a spark when
it was needed. He had worked his
way to this moment, ever since
thatday he was helped offcthe
field.
"It was good to see it, butI
wasn't surprised to see it," said
redshirt sophomore wide receiver
Amara Darboh.
Only after the clock wound

Johnson sit in the student section.
He sprinted to the section, with
that same speed, and he jumped

But he stayed this time to soak
up the moment, his armsaround
his teammates. He sat on that
ledge with a smile across his face
that carried over to the press
conference.
The fans patted him on the
back, the TV cameras focused on
him at the end, theInternet sang
his praises.
"I can'tthink of any other

Special teams' struggles
doom Wolverines on road

M' upsets Spartans

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
HOUGHTON, Mich. - Until

team hadn't started a season

blame for that.
After getting swept at No. 17
Michigan
Tech this MICHIGAN 2
weekend, MICH. TECH 4
- a
series in MICHIGAN 2
which the MICH. TECH 5
Wolverines were outscored
4-0 on special teams - all
the concerns about leveling
the plus-minus ratio on the
power play and penalty kill are
amplified.
"Our special teams should be
plus for us to be playing well,
and right now they're a big
negative, so we've got to get that
fixed," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson before traveling to
UMass-Lowell on Oct. 24.
But the issues with the
penalty kill weren't present
until Saturday's loss. Michigan
had allowed just two power-
play goals in the 18 times it
was shorthanded this season,
including a perfect 14-for-14'
stretch dating back to a 2-1 win
over New Hampshire on Oct.
18.
But Saturday was an absolute
debacle. Berenson referred to
Michigan T'ech's performance
as "a clinic," the way the
Wolverines were outworked on
their power play.
The penalty kill, arguably
Michigan's most acclaimed
strength before Saturday,
couldn't even perform up to
expectations in a disastrous
weekend. The Wolverines
conceded four power-play goals

in the series finale, resulting in
a 6-2 loss.
"On special teams, we had
to be better on the power play
than we were last night, and
we were 0-for-7," Berenson said
after Saturday's loss. "Then on
the penalty kill, we thought
we were OK, but then we got
schooled tonight. So it was a
game of special teams tonight,
and that was the difference."
There were simple mistakes
like defensive-zone turnovers
that led to an easy tap-in goal
for forward Tyler Heinonen in
the first period. Other times,
a series of mental lapses in
Michigan's own zone assisted
the Huskies in picking apart a
penalty-killing unit that had
ranked among the nation's best.
Berenson pinned the
inability to execute on a myriad
of things, such as winning
faceoffs, blocking shots and
cutting off passing lanes as
reasons for the pitiful showing
on the penalty kill.
But all Michigan's
shortcomings can't be stated
without a tip of the cap to
Michigan Tech. The Huskies
looked faster and more inspired
in both of this

Max Shuatt. "But we've got
to be better, block more shots.
We've got to be willing to put
it on the line more for the rest
of our team. It was a really bad
effort on the PK by our team."
The Wolverines could never
replicate Michigan Tech's
gritty effort, displaying a dismal
performance on the power-play
unit as well. In 13 opportunities
with the man-advantage,
Michigan never scored.
This issue has been a long-
standingonethough, especially
compared to the fresh concerns
about the penalty kill. The
Wolverines have scored just
three goals in 28 chances on the
power play this season, good for
a 10-percent success rate.
"We have a lot of guys that
haven't scored yet, and they're
fighting the puck," Berenson
said. "You saw we had just-
about-empty-net opportunities
that we fanned on. We've got
to be better with the puck and
without the puck."
In its seven games this year,
Michigan has conceded two
shorthanded goals. During the

For the Daily
The Michigan men's soccer
team hadn't taken home the Big
Bear Trophy - given annually
to the winner of the Michigan-
Michigan State game - from East
Lansing since 2003.
That streak was in danger
of continuing Sunday until
fifth-year senior midfielder
Tyler Arnone stepped in. When
Michigan State's Jay Chapman
put the Spartans on top just
before halftime, Arnone gathered
his teammates and tried to regain
the lost morale.
"I told everyone, 'We're going
to winthisgame,"'Arnonesaid. "I
looked everyone in the eye. I said,
'We're goingto calm down and get
back to doing what we're good at,
and we'll be the better team."'
A record crowd saw the
Wolverines knock off the
12th-ranked Spartans on their
Senior Day in a come-from-
behind effort, 3-2.
Taking into account Arnone's
words, Michigan clicked on all
cylinders throughout the second
half. It took the Wolverines just
nine minutes to find an equalizer.
junior forward William Mellors-
Blair ran down the right sideline,
beating Spartan defenders, and
found freshman forward Ahinga
Selemani inside the six-yard box,
who had the easy finish past
the post, making this his third
straight game with a goal.
Just five minuteslater, Selemani
assisted forward Colin McAtee,
who gained possession and put a
run past the Michigan State back
line to beat Spartan goalkeeper
Zach Bennett - putting the
Wolverines up for good.
Michigan'syoungforwards put
pressure on the Spartans' well-
experienced back line from the

It was in the eigth minute,
when the ball fell to Arnone, that
Michigan would be rewarded for
its fast start. Arnone took a touch
off a poor Spartan clearance, then
volleyed ahard shotjust out ofthe
reach of Bennett. It was Arnone's
first goal of the year after being
in and out of the squad due to
multiple injuries.
"To finally connect and see
it hit the back of the net was
absolutely amazing," Arnone said.
"It set up quite nicely for me, and I
focused on my technique, put my
foot through the ball and let it do
the rest."
An early start was huge for the
Wolverines, as Michigan State
(9-4-4 overall, 3-2-2 Big Ten) had
only given up nine goals heading
into the match. Getting ahead put
the Spartans in a position they
weren't accustomed to - playing
from behind..

The Michigan football team
grabbed -its second conference
win of the season in a dominant
34-10 win over Indiana on
Saturday. It was the Wolverines'
19th straight win over the
Hoosiers, leavingthemin abetter
position to land a bowl game.
Here are five things we
learned from Michigan's second
win in three games:
1. Drake Johnson is a
starting running back.
The redshirt sophomore had
a coming-out party Saturday
running for 122 yards and two
touchdowns on 16 carries in
the first extended action of his
career. Johnson is a slashing,
weaving runner and isn't the
typical power running back that
Michigan coach Brady Hoke has
used throughout his tenure - but
maybe that's a good thing.
As a slasher, Johnson utilizes
his speed and vision to find the
outside or the holes. He has the
ability to break off runs for a
touchdown, avoid tackles and
catch passes out of the backfield.
In the first six games of the
season, when sophomore Derrick
Green - who is out for the season
with a broken collarbone - came

Doug Nussmeier usually sent

But with Smith struggling
with the starting responsibilities,
combined with the fact that
he came out for several series
due to injury against the
Hoosiers, Johnson was given
the opportunity, and he rose to
the occasion. If nothing else,
Johnson provides a different look
for opposing defenses and helps
mix up the necessary coverage.
2. When Michigan's defense
and offense play together, they
win.
This isn't rocket science:
When Michigan's defense and
offense play up to their potential,
the team wins. And against
Indiana, that finally happened.
