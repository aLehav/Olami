week's election.

The debate was originally
scheduled for last Thursday, but
was postponed due to inclement

chairs were originally set up for
'the event, but more seats were
requested to accommodate the

interested in hearing from candi-

debate did not offer candidates the
opportunity for rebuttal, and each
candidate answered questions in

10 years ago this week (March
19, 2002): A racially insensitive
phrase regarding affirmative
actinn was found written in yel-
low chalk on the Diag, the Daily
reported.
Panther McAllister, then-
speaker for the Black Stodent
Union, said the incident served
as a reminder to students that
there was more do he done to
improve race relations on cam-
pos and aroond the nation.
Then-LSA senior Erin Weber
told the Daily she was astoonded
to find racist comments on cam-
pus.
"It's disappointing that a cam-
pos as liberal and diverse as Ann
Arbor would still have hatefol
opinions floating aroond like

this," Weher said. "Yoo'd like to
think that ignorance lives some-
where else."
20 years ago this week (March

Department of Political Science
was ranked as the hest in the
country by U.S. News and World

University, the Daily reported.
Arlene Saxonhouse, then-
chair of the Department of Polit-
ical Science, spoke to the Daily
ahout the department's past suc-
cess and newly-assigned rank-
ing.
"Obvioosly, we're delighted.
We've always been a strong

department - in the top three,"
Saxonhoose said.

Thrift store
employee saves
rare book
Thanks to an eye for vintage
items and a little Internet sleuth-
ing, the Community Closet's
Heather Heath has made museum
staff in Michigan very happy.
* A limited-edition book, pub-
lished in 1923, will soon be on its
way to the Leslie Area Museum,
in Leslie, Mich., a small town
of about 2,000 located 25 miles
south of Lansing, the state capital.
Caron Cooper, the Community
Closet's executive director, asked
the store's board for permission to
donate the book to the Michigan
museum. It's the store's policy to
share things with other nonprof-
its, Cooper said.
"It's like if someone in Michi-
gan had come across an original
copy of a Doris Whithorn book
that the museum didn't have a
copy of," Cooper said Tuesday,
referring to the local historian,
author and Yellowstone Gateway
Museum founder.

* going to Fort Peck
Sixty-four bison from Yel-

the iconic animals.
Robert Magnan with the Fort
Peck Fish and Game Depart-
ment says tribal and state officials
signed an agreement late Fri-
day allowing the transfer to take
place.
Magnan says the date of the
shipment was kept quiet until it
was under way to avoid a court
injunction. A group of northeast-
ern Montana landowners and
property groups have sued to stop
the transfer.

* Avalanche kills
five foreign
tourists in Norway
Five people were killed and
one person was dug out alive after
Swiss and French skiers were
buried by an avalanche yesterday
on Norway's Arctic fringe.
Rescuers located the victims
through beacons from their radio
transceivers, but only the first
person they found survived, a
Swiss man who was taken to a
local hospital in stable condition.
A 1-kilometer (3,000-foot) wall
of snow came crashing down on
the skiers on Sorbmegaisa moun-
tain, 65 kilometers (40 miles) east
of the northern city of Tromsoe,
police spokesman Morten Pet-
tersen said. The last victim was
found buried under 6 meters (20

feet) of snow.

Original Einstein
manuscripts to be
posted online
Albert Einstein's complete
archives - from personal corre-
spondence with half a dozen lov-
ers to notebooks scribbled with
his groundbreaking scientific
research - are going online for
the first time.
The Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, which owns the Ger-
man Jewish physicist's papers, is
pulling never-before seen items
from its climate-controlled safe,
photographing them in high reso-
lution and posting them on the
Internet - offering the public a
nuanced and fuller portrait of the
man behind the scientific genius.
Only 900 manuscript images,
and an incomplete catalog listing
just half of the archive's contents,
had been posted online since
2003. Now, with a grant from the
Polonsky Foundation UK, which
previously helped digitize Isaac
Newton's papers, all 80,000 items
from the Einstein collection have
been cataloged and enhanced
with cross referencing technol-
ogy.

the standard," Goddard said.
"Then we come in and we look
and see one: if the policies and
procedure meet the intent of the
standard, and two: are you fol-
lowing that policy and proce-
dure?"
Dean Tondiglia, assistant
chief of the Kent State Uni-
versity Police Department in
Ohio, and Geoffrey Ice, execu-
tive director of the Connecticut
State Police Academy Alumni
Educational Foundation Inc.,
are the CALEA officials who
will assess DPS in the upcoming
weeks. Tondiglia and Ice will
review DPS documents, inter-
view staff and inspect buildings
to make sure standards are met.
As part of their evaluation,
the assessors will host a meet-
ing at 5 p.m. on Monday, March
26 in the Campus Safety Ser-
vice Building, where the pub-
lic can offer input on how well
DPS has met the more than 460
accreditation standards CALEA
requires police agencies to
uphold.
Goddard said the public event
is open for anyone who has
comments about how well DPS
policies have met CALEA stan-
dards.
"It's a completely public event
to talk about the agency's pur-
suit for accreditation," Goddard
said. "CALEA is not an investi-
gative agency, so if they are hav-
ing some concerns about that,
this is not the proper venue, this
is truly about the agency's pur-
suit for accreditation. They'll
listen to anything and take com-
ments and criticisms."
DPS spokeswoman Diane

Brown said a similar opportu-
nity for the public to comment
was held in 2009, adding that
the event will offer the public
a chance to help the assessors
with their evaluation.
"It's kind of structured differ-
ently, because it's not our meet-
ing," Brown said. "It's a meeting
that the assessors actually hold
so they can hear feedback from
the community so they can hear
how the community thinks the
department adheres to its poli-
cies."
Brown noted that the pub-
lic didn't provide CALEA with
much feedback in 2009, but was
generally positive.
"There was very little feed-
back last time," Brown said.
"Essentially everything that
was said at the public meeting
was positive and supportive."
DPS may face criticism this
year for its involvement in the
six-month delay in reporting
former UMHS resident Ste-
phen Jenson's alleged posses-
sion of child pornography at
the University Hospital in May.
The University's internal audit
reported that DPS failed to
respond to a voicemail regard-
ing the incident left by a Hospi-
tal Security officer.
Brown said the department
does not expect the Jenson
case to be an issue with CALEA
accreditors.
"Things that happened with
Jenson were not part of us,"
Brown said. "When we were
notified of the alleged crime
with the Jenson case, we inves-
tigated it promptly, so thus we
don't expect the accreditation
to be impacted with that case."
She added that DPS has mea-
sures in place to ensure their
policies reflect CALEA stan-

dards.
"We don't need to bother
the whole department with the
CALEA standards because they
need to follow the policies,"
Brown said. "But the people
who work most'closely with our
accreditation process and the
people who have to review and
revise policy have to be sure
that when they revise the poli-
cies they know what the stan-
dards are."
Brown said public safety
departments on college cam-
puses have additional CALEA
standards to meet, such as com-
pliance with the Jeanne Clery
Act, which requires that colleg-
es throughout the United States
disclose information about
crime near campuses, as DPS
does through its annual report
and its daily crime log.
"One standard for higher edu-
cation police agencies has to do
with the Clery Act and whether
or not we have certain elements
in place that correspond to the
Clery Act; issuing our crime
stats, having a daily crime log,"
she said.
Brown said DPS expects to be
re-accredited and stressed that
DPS is taking the process very
seriously.
"We think that accreditation
is very important," Brown said.
"Not only because accredita-
tion in an academic environ-
ment is evidence of successful
performance, but also because
we believe that affirmation of
following a very high industry
standard is very important to
our community, and an expecta-
tion of our community."

out a community, affecting
local businesses and criminal
justice systems.
"The criminal justice sys-
tem, as it functions in Genesee
County, is almost broken," Fra-
ser said, citing the county's dif-
ficulty booking people on time
and the poor condition of the
jail.
Flint Mayor Dayne Walling
said his city's financial distress
was undeniable, and political
cooperation was necessary for
economic turnaround.
"There is no debate that
the city of Flint is in a severe
financial condition," Walling
said. "There is no question that
Michigan cities are going to
take serious cooperation and
support to thrive and prosper."
Walling said he has been
working with the Flint finan-
cial manager to cut costs and
restructure the debt.
"We simply can't go back to
another big political tug-of-
war that leaves the community
in worse shape than it started
in," Walling said.
Brandon Jessup, chairman
and CEO of Michigan Forward
- a non-profit company that
helps develop progressive poli-
cies in the state - said the wide
range of powers given to the
financial managers under the
law goes against the basic prin-
ciples of democracy.
"Michigan's (emergency
manager) law presents a power
grab intolerable of our form of
democracy," Jessup said. "The
law presents a clear threat to
voters across the state."
Jessup said the law priva-
tizes local government, which
hurts the existing democratic
institutions and inflates com-

munity expenses.
"This bad public policy not
only encourages social sup-
pression and disenfranchise-
ment, it redirects economic
access," Jessup said. "(Local
economy) moves from public to
private interest."
Joseph Harris, the Benton
Harbor emergency manager,
said financially weak cities
could only improve by drasti-
cally changing the way they
operate.
"We cannot afford to expect
financiallydistressed localgov-
ernments to reverse declines if
they are not making dramatic
changes," Harris said. "Condi-
tions cannot be improved by
sticking to failing methods."
Harris said abandoning the
law in its early stages would
be an injustice to residents of
economically failing commu-
nities.
"If we abort PA 4 before it
has been allowed an opportu-
nity to be assessed based on its
performance, it would decry
not only the financially dis-
tressed communities, but other
communities that would be
harmed by the distress," Har-
ris said.
Rackham student Alexander
Robinson, a Benton Harbor res-
ident, attended the panel dis-
cussion and said he worked for
Harris in Benton Harbor and
experienced the effects of the
city's financial shortfalls.
"I'm in support of anything
that fixes the deep structural
issues present in Benton Har-
bor," Robinson said.
Robinson said he attended
the panel to learn more about
the problems surrounding the
emergency manager law and
the arguments against it.
"I want to understand the
critical issue, gain a deeper
insight and hear the opposition

to take care of, houses that need

and lives."
Councilmember Marcia Hig-
gins (D-Ward 4) said she wit-
nessed Thursday's storm and saw
a transformer get struck by light-

ning and a garage erupt in flames.
She echoed Briere's desire for the
community to unite to aid areas
in need.
Higgins added she was
impressed by the way the Ann
Arbor community reacted to the
aftermath of the storm, noting
the quick response of police and
fire officials, especially in areas of
significant damage and flooding.
"Staff responded really well"
at several immediate lakes that

were named in our neighbor-
hood because of the streets that
were flooded," Higgins said. "But
it was really enjoyable to see our
community come out, to see those
people who were stuck to help
(each other) get their cars out."

May said donations gener-

provide more than $10 million.
He said the recent economic

he expects the University to

SACUA ELECTS THREE
NEW MEMBERS
Three new members were also
elected to three-year terms on
the Senate Advisory Committee
on University Affairs.
During the meeting, Astron-
omy Prof Sally Oey, Dentistry
Prof. Graham Rex Holland and
Scott Masten, a professor of
business economics and public
policy, were all elected to posi-
tions on the committee.
In his candidate statement,
Masten, who received the high-
est number of votes, said fac-
ulty government functions best
when it halts poorly developed
initiatives. He specifically cited
his efforts to stop performance-
based faculty pay 'when he
served on several Senate Assem-
bly committees over the past
decade.
"I think we are more effective
in facultygovernanceatstopping
really bad policies and actions
than we are (in) promoting posi-
tive initiatives," Masten said.
Masten added that he hopes
SACUA will increase its efforts
to be a responsible governing
body by making sure the campus
community is aware of the com-
mittee's efforts.
"(We should) hold people
accountable and increase trans-
parency," he said.
Oey echoed Masten, and said
she wants to increase clarity in
University governance.
"I have an appreciation for
transparency," Oey said in her
candidate statement. "Mutual
trust and mutual interest in
working toward a common goal
is essential."
Holland commented that
University administrators have
become increasingly guarded.
"I strongly support the idea
of faculty governance because
that is what has made the Uni-
versity distinctive, but that,
unfortunately, is slowly being
eroded," he said. "There is an
increase in secrecy ... and that's
absolute nonsense."

Challenge the states
Federal penalties won't stop higher education cuts
J an attempt to exert greater influence over higher education in
the United States, the Obama administration has announced a
plan to penalize states that do not sufficiently fund public colleg-
es and Universities with federal aid cuts. The program, known as the
College Access Challenge Grant, is ineffective because its minor pen-
alties are not strong enough to incentivize states to provide increased
education funding. It unnecessarily depletes higher education budgets.

Viral activism

The College Access Challenge was passed
by Congress in 2008, and threatens federal
aid cuts to states that provide appropriations
to their public colleges that are less than the
average amount the state gave over the previ-
ous five years. But with the economic down-
turn, states nationwide have been forced to
cut their budgets across the board. The fed-
eral government has allowed states to avoid
this federal aid penalty if they can prove
that they have not depleted higher education
funding disproportionately. Of the 22 states
that significantly cut higher education fund-
ing, most states have been able to prove that
they have not overly cut college education
and have then still received federal aid. How-
ever, Michigan and Alabama have failed to
receive such waivers. Michigan cut support
for public schools by 6.35 percent in 2010
while revenues fell only 5.5 percent.
Michigan is now slated to lose $4.2 mil-
lion in federal aid. In order to prevent such
penalties, Michigan would have to reinvest
$58 million in higher education. Alabama is
scheduled to lose $2.1 million in aid, and they
would have to restore $36.9 million in state
education funding. These minor cuts in fed-

eral aid for college education are not strong
enough incentives for states to increase their
higher education appropriations. It's unreal-
istic to expect state legislatures to drastically
alter their education budgets for the minor
incentive of avoiding federal aid penalties.
The College Access Challenge Grant program
unnecessarily cuts college education funding
and is going to continue the unsustainable
trend of rising tuition costs for Michigan stu-
dents, including those here at the University.
Despite the ineffectiveness of the College
Access Challenge program, responsibility for
higher education cuts ultimately lies with
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and the Republi-
cans in Lansing. While it's commendable that
Snyder will replace $2 million of the funding
lost with state money, that amount still isn't
enough. If the conservative model of individ-
ual responsibility is going to be fair and effec-
tive in the coming decades, state governments
must assume the responsibility of giving their
people the tools to be self-reliant. To leave
the poor without a proper education or public
assistance is unjust. Snyder and Republicans
across the country should, therefore, rethink
the role of government in public education.

We saw this NAHATA
play out over
the last couple
weeks as KONY 2012 went viral
in a matter of hours. For days, my
Facebook newsfeed and Twitter
feed were flooded with links to the
30-minute video and posts urg-
ing people to "Stop KONY." What
started out as an experiment in
social media by Invisible Children
undoubtedly succeeded - millions
of people around the world now
know who Kony is.
Social media has the rare abil-
ity to capture people's attention,
deliver a specific message and per-
suade people to spread the word -
all at once, in a very short amount of
time. It's a wonderful way to cham-
pion a cause or reach out to a large
group of people very quickly. But
the fleeting nature of social media,
while making a cause trendy, often
has the effect of being one-dimen-
sional and short-lived.
The fact that there are so many
people, groups, ideas and organiza-
tions competing for people's atten-
tion means that if a message has any
chance of trending, it must be sen-
sational, interesting or extremely
entertaining - which also means,
more times than not, that it will
be somewhat distorted or exagger-
ated from reality. This is something
that we often forget when getting

caught up in the momentum of a
compelling cause.
This was perhaps nevermore evi-
dent than with the Kony campaign.
While the campaign did a phenom-
enal job of making people aware of
an issue that very few knew about
before, it gave a very superficial
view of the problem at hand. The
problem of child soldiers is a wide-
spread issue, something that spans
much farther than one individual or
one country. A number of situation-
al and political factors play into the
situation in Uganda - this can't be
reduced to one individual. Support-
ing and spreading awareness about
issues is important, but it's equally
important to go the extra step and
make sure to understand the full
scope of the issue.
We live in an era when even the
news is delivered in sound bytes,
and social media only makes it
easier for these sound bytes to
travel around the world at alarm-
ing speeds. However, there's only
so much that can be said about any
given issue in 140 characters. A sta-
tus update or a tweet shows only
one angle or take on an issue. What
you see on Facebook or Twitter is
one person's opinion of a situation,
or one article about an issue or one
video portraying a cause.
What is posted via social mediais
picked specifically to move people,
to persuade them, to tell them a
particular story in a particular way.
Grassroots organizing through
social media is a great avenue to
procure change, but if the infor-
mation isn't taken with a grain of
salt, it can just as, easily become a
breeding ground for propaganda
and sensationalistic rhetoric. The
things that will trend or spread
like wildfire across the world aren't
always factually correct and gener-

ally don't tell the full story.
Invisible Children's social media
campaign teaches us valuable les-
sons. It shows that while social
media is instrumental and invalu-
able in spreading awareness, liking
a link on Facebook or re-tweeting a
post on Twitter doesn't necessarily
make you socially aware. To really
understand an issue, it's important
to go the extrastep byreadingabout
it, researching it and acquainting
yourself with its complexities.
Information
travels the world
in minutes.
In a time when trends change
every day, it's important to keep
in mind the importance of not just
taking things at face value. What
people talk about on Facebook or
Twitter changes every day, if not
every hour. The depth of worldwide
social justice and human rights
issues - like child soldiers for
example - can't be fully portrayed
by such a transitory medium. Social
media is just the first step in enact-
ing social change - it's simply a
way to introduce people to an issue.
True social change will only hap-
pen when people take the time to
delve into an issue, when people
use what they see on Facebook and
Twitter as a starting point for dis-
cussion and dialogue.

We all have a place on campus

While walking around campus these past
few days, you may have seen posters and cam-
paign material in the form of memes charac-
terizing the typical University student's trials
and tribulations. We're told that these delight-
ful little placards and posters advertising our
platform have led to a lot of people referring
to us as the "Meme Candidates" - a favor-
able enough moniker, considering we had a
lot of fun crafting our campaign and enjoy the
appreciation our wordplay has garnered. Now
that we've got you talking, we'd like to give
you a little insight into the painstaking pro-
cess that went into preparing our platform.
We're well aware of the current apathy
toward student government that pervades
the University. Disenchantment with the sta-
tus quo is what led us to run as independent
candidates. We strongly believe that existing
outside the sphere of the prevailing political
machinery helps us be more perceptive of
what students really want and need. The sim-
ple fact is that this is a democracy, not a dicta-
torship, which is why we talked at length with
hundreds of students who essentially crafted,
created and validated our platform.
At a school the size of ours, capturing the
diversity of the student body in terms of opin-
ions and grievances is absolutely crucial. We
took great care to engage with students of all
majors, classes and walks of life at academic
and residential locations ranging from the
UGLi to Angell Hall, from the Business School
to the School of Social Work, from Mason
Hall to the very depths of North Campus. We
were careful to truly engage with you in the
process, because we sincerely believe that
two high-quality hours spent talking with
one student is far better than two hours spent
handing out fliers to 1,000 students. A num-
ber of you can attest to this, especially those
who were initially annoyed at our infringing
on your time, but with whom we ended up
having great and productive conversations.
Having compiled quite a comprehensive list of
problems and ideas from students in addition
to our own ideas, we set about researching
them from a feasibility standpoint by talking

to administrators and benchmarking against
what other universities have in place. Then
we went back to the students and closed the
feedback loop by getting their approval on the
remaining initiatives. Those initiatives that
were met with significant favor were incorpo-
rated into our platform.
We aren't stopping here. The valuable
insights we've gained are currently being sup-
plemented by talking to student athletes, stu-
dent organization leaders - including those
with as few as five members - and even local
business owners, all integral stakeholders in
every student's campus life. Two main points
have occurred to us during this process: the
first being that University students are an
absolute treat to converse with. Seriously, give
yourself a pat on the back, because we truly
enjoyed your inspiring company. Secondly,
our belief that this election is as much about
the why of student government as it is about
the what and how.
As independents, we promise to return to
the true why of CSG by taking it back to the
students and catering to their comforts and
dreams, and we're confident that this shows in
everything we've done so far and everything
we intend to do.
Our aim has been to take student activism
from the dusty realms of catchphrases and
buzzwords and put it firmly front and center
by harnessing the student voice through the
actionable initiatives championed by you and
outlined in our platform. This is by no means a
finished endeavor - we welcome any further
questions, comments and suggestions on our
Facebook page, www.facebook.com/Manis-
hAndOmar. And while we sincerely appreci-
ate the attention and praise our meme posters
and social media presence have garnered, in
all seriousness, your support and engagement
with our platform are what truly mean the
world tous.
Manish Parikh and Omar Hashwi are
independent candidates running for the
positions of president and vice-president
of the Central Student Government.

I remember at freshman orientation back in the
summer of 2008 when I was given a list of more than
2,000 student organizations on campus. I remember
looking at this list, thinking I already knew exactly
which groups I would be a part of. My high-school
student council experience pushed me toward the
Michigan Student Assembly - now the Central Stu-
dent Government. My progressive political stance
pushed me toward College Democrats. I thought Ihad
it all figured out. But then this little thing called IASA
came into my life. After much pressure and prodding,
I signed up tobe a dancer in the Indian American Stu-
dentAssociation's annual cultural show. Before I knew
it, I was immersed in the Indian community at the
University, and before long, I was exposed to the other
organizations that fall under the South Asian umbrella
on our campus. That's how the South Asian Awareness
Network became a part of my life.
If you talked to most of my friends and asked them
what I care about the most on campus, I'm sure that
99 percent of them would respond immediately with
SAAN - the student organization that I have had the
privilege of making a part of my life for the past three
years. A lot of people think I'm crazy. I spent a major-
ity of my sophomore year staying up until 5 a.m. in
the Fish Bowl just so I could handle 18 credits and my
responsibilities as a marketing chair for SAAN. Junior
year was spent working to coordinate innovative con-
ference content and tryingto woo speakers, such as the
deputy chief of mission of India, to the United States.
And finally, my experience came full circle as a senior,
when I had the honor of serving as chair for the orga-
nization that changed my life, and I was able to help
fuel the passions of 18 individuals who I know will help
SAAN continue its legacy.
There are more than 2,000 student organizations on
campus - from Greek Life, to service organizations,
to Churros for Change. Each organization has its role
at the University, and not one is less deserving than

another of having a place on campus. Student organi-
zations have the unique ability to bring people from
different backgrounds together on the basis of a singu-
lar cause. This was certainly the case when I went to
my first SAAN conference as a freshman. Blown away
by the professionalism and extent of the conference, I
realized that there was a place for me to meld my heri-
tage with my passion for social change. I ran with the
opportunity I was given as a marketing chair and con-
tinued my passion through my different positions on
the Central Planning Team.
But what I found after our conference in January
- which always seems to fall on the coldest week-
end of the year - is not that I learned so much about
social justice and activism, but that there are no other
individuals with whom I would rather have created
that conference. This is the beauty of a student orga-
nization. Building relationships with other people
who shared my passions - and making them my best
friends at the same time - turned me into the person
I am today. I wouldn't consider myself a social justice
activist if it weren't for the chair who challenged me
to think differently when I was a sophomore, or my
co-chairs over the years who have forced me to accept
things as they come. There is no one who better under-
stand show I function than the people who have spent
a year with me on the Central Planning Team, nor will
there be anyone who I will count on as much as I count
on those individuals. SAAN - and the experiences that
I have had through my work with the organization -
has forever molded me into the social justice activist
that I am today. My career choice, my day-to-day deci-
sions, the way I lead - all of these are results of the
leader I have become through my work with SAAN.
And for that I will be forever thankful and apprecia-
tive.

lamented the rebirth of
Detroit's 107.5, WGPR. At
the crest of the new year, the

don't find particularly endear-

had listened to GPR hoping to
hear the ghost of the legendary
Detroit DJ Electrifying Mojo
and others kicking around some
great disco, acid house and
techno on weekends. I remained
content to ignore an otherwise
tepid array of what they played
throughout most of the week - a
mix of what will pass for "grown

disorienting health, economic

I would pre-set GPR into my

of static. Despite the jarring shift
in programming, I've chosen to
leave it locked in, a button push
away. And like any serious rela-

the flaws and patience necessary
to find true love.
The station is more or less
anonymous now and less adven-

One Direction can't quite
capture boy-band nostalgia

Tanlines just skin-deep

Minus the tornado-y hail, it's
probably safe to say that spring

excursions and
Tanlines. Mixed
Tanlines, Emotions
the electro-
pop duo from True Panther
Brooklyn, has
arrived just in time with their
debut LP Mixed Emotions. While
the guys - instrumentalist Jesse
Cohen and vocalist Eric Emm -
released a compilation album and
an EP in 2010, this marks their
first LP. They've made plenty of
remixes and some surprisingly
popular singles, but Mixed Emo-
tions serves as an examination of
whether Tanlines can create an
album that stands on its own.
Mixed Emotions is an album
created while in motion: Emm and
Cohen began it while on tour in
Europe, continued in a Brooklyn
studio, migrated to various apart-
ments and ended up in Miami to
seek the aid of production genius
Jimmy Douglass. Oddly enough,
Emm and Cohen, in an interview
with electronic news publication
The Daily, expressed dissatisfac-
tion about the collaboration with
Douglass. Apparently, their work
with the four-time Grammy win-
ner resulted in something that
began sounding "pretty terrible"
and "ended up somewhere in the
middle." Too often, the compro-
mise is uncomfortably apparent
in the album - it's a sunny and
danceable record, but as the boys
admitted, quite average.
While in Miami, Emm and
Cohen would go earn their tan
lines every morning swimming
in the ocean, then record for the
rest of the day. This explains the
beach-inspired sound found in
the first track "Brothers," which
begins with wave noises and
adds in some bongos and pulsat-

Without a doubt, One Direc-
tion's debut will have 15-year-
old girls jumping for joy all over
the United
States. This
group could get
a number-one One
album from
remixes of Direction
"Happy Birth- Up All Night
day," as long as
the cover art is Columbia
included.
The success
of the group is surprising, espe-
cially given that- One Direction
was formed from the failure of
its individual members to make
it through the UK television sing-
ing competition "The X Factor."
If only the content of its album
Up All Night were as bold as the
mere presence of the group seems
to be. Whoever put the album
together for One Direction -
facing facts, nobody in the clan
is capable of more than making
noise and jumping - was playing
it very safe.
Three of the album's songs,
including its biggest hit "What
Makes You Beautiful," were writ-
ten by Rami, famous for his work
with the Backstreet Boys and
*NSYNC. This means that there
will be no whining about how
One Direction shouldn't be com-
pared to '90s boy bands, because
clearly, it's trying very hard to be
one. To complement this over-
used '90s songwriter, "Save You
Tonight" was written and pro-
duced by RedOne, who seems to
be on every album nowadays.
Overall, the tracks on the
album aren't bad, they're just not
interesting. Nothing jumps out at
the listener when going through
the record, especially not the
physical sound of the voices.
Unlike the carefully auditioned
boy bands of the '90s, One Direc-
tion was formed on a "Hey, let's
just do this" basis and is therefore
lacking distinct vocals. Essential-
ly, it will alwaysberecognized for
its song and not its sound - even

CANDIDATES
From Page 1
the importance of this year's
election, and Mersol-Barg, Sathi
and Singh all described said the
contest demonstrated the wide
range of interests of the stu-
dent body. While CSG President
DeAndree Watson, who ran on
the MForward ticket, handily
won a lopsided election last year,
this year's candidates represent a
wide slate of ideas on the direc-
tion and duty of student govern-
ment.
As the current vice speaker of
the assembly, Sathi, the MFor-
ward nominee whose party has
won the last two presidential
elections, spoke about his efforts
to bring medical amnesty to the
University. He also noted that he
would continue to advocate for
student issues at the state level
through the Student Association
of Michigan - a joint organiza-
tion of student governments at
universities across the state.
He added that he would work
to improve the transparency of
student government by develop-
ing a more comprehensive web-
site that publishes details about
CSG budgets, as well as funding,
voting and attendance records.
Singh, the CSG treasurer,
said her presidency would focus
more on "tangible" goals around
campus, such as streamlining
the financial aid application
process, creating a centralized
calendar for all student groups
and improving off-campus hous-
ing options. She also discussed
her work on the Student Orga-
nization Funding Commission,
for which she helped develop a
new rolling funding system that
allows student groups to get
funding on a weeklybasis instead
of a few times per semester.
Mersol-Barg, an assembly
representative, discussed CSG's
potential to advocate for social
change on campus and beyond.
In addition to discussing his
involvement with the student
organization he founded, the
Coalition for Tuition Equality,

he spoke of his commitment to
minority groups on campus.
Manish Parikh, the indepen-
dent candidate, said as a student
uninterested in pursuing a politi-
cal career he is running purelyto
help students. He outlined sever-
al plans for his presidency, such
as establishing a 24-hour cafe,
requiring professors to publish
their syllabi prior to registration,
implementing a meet-your-ath-
lete day in the Diag and improv-
ing CSG's social media use.
Overall, the candidates iden-
tified rising tuition as the major
problem facing students and
recognized the need for CSG to
increase communication with
students and University officials.
Both Parikh and Mersol-Barg
provided unige ways for stu-
dents to interact with CSG and
propose new ideas. Parikh gave
out his e-mail address and phone
number to the attendees, and
encouraged students to contact
him with ideas for his platform,
while Mersol-Barg said he would
set up desk on the Diag if neces-
sary.
"If I have to - gosh darn it -
I'll set up a desk in the middle of
the Diag," Mersol-Barg said. "I'll
camp out there, hold office hours
... I don't see people going up to
the third floor of the Union try-
ing to talk to the student body
president."
CSG also held the vice presi-
dential debate immediately after
the presidential debate.
LSA sophomore Louis Miran-
te of MForward, LSA junior
Ethan Hahn of youMICH, LSA
junior Amy Navvab of OurMich-
igan, and LSA sophomore Omar
Hashwi, an independent, partici-
pated in the debate.
The discussion focused on
many of the same issues raised in
the presidential debate, with the
addition of topics on divestment
of University funds and Hahn's
tenure as a representative of the
assembly.
The candidates answered a
question about a resolution dis-
cussed by the assembly in April
2011 that would have supported
University divestment from Isra-

el.
While most of the candidates
said it's within the role of student
government to discuss this topic,
they noted in their responses
that it's too politically charged
and divisive to make a decision.
Hashwi, however, expressed in
his answer that CSG should play
a larger role in the issue.
Mirante identified Hashwi
as an author of the resolution,
but Hashwi denied the role -
Hashwi was not the author on
the bill that was presented to the
assembly in April, but did author
an earlier draft of the resolution.
Regardless, Hashwi said the
resolution was an insignificant
issue and his support for it was
not politically motivated.
"If there was an irresponsible
company that was supported
(by the University) and they just
happened to do business with
Lebanon, I would not support
that company because they're
irresponsible," Hashwi said.
Mirante, who said he hails
from San Francisco, said the
University of California, Berke-
ley's student government passed
a similar resolution regarding
divestment from companies who
did business with Israel, and was
met with disagreement.
"There were fights on cam-
pus and people felt afraid to go
to school," Mirante said. "That's
not something I support."

sible motive for the attack on the

August.
A hospital official said the sol-
dier was in serious condition with
stab wounds near her heart.
Train service was halted while
a preliminary investigation at the
scene of the attack was carried
out, Rosenfeld said.
Also Thursday, rights activ-
ists said the health of a Palestin-
ian detainee who has been on a
hunger strike for amonth is dete-
riorating. Hana Shalabi, 30, has
refused food since her arrest by
Israel on Feb. 16. She is being held
without formal charges in so-
called administrative detention
and is demanding to be released
immediately.
A doctor from Israel's branch
of Physicians for Human Rights
examined her earlier this week
and reported advanced muscle
atrophy and wasting, along with
severe dizziness and muscle pain,
especially in her chest and back.
Israel Prisons Author-
ity spokeswoman Sivan Weizman
said Shalabi's condition is "rela-
tively okay." An independent eth-
ics committee discussed her case
this week and decided against
force-feeding her, Weizman said.
Shalabi remains in her cell, she
added.
Palestinian officials said four
more administrative detainees
have launched hunger strikes
since the beginning of March.
The oldest in the group, 72-year-
old Ahmed Haj Ali, a lawmaker
from the Islamic militant Hamas,
joined Wednesday, said Issa 51
Karakeh, the Palestinian minister
for prisoner affairs.
Karakeh said it's the first time
hunger strikers are targeting a
specific Israeli detention policy,
adding that more prisoners plan
to launch hunger strikes next
month. More than 300 Palestin-
ians are currently held without
formal charges. In all, more than
6,000 Palestinians are being held
by Israel for security-related
offenses.
Israel has defended adminis-
trative detentions as a necessary
tool to stop militant activity.
Rights activists say interna-
tional law allows this practice
only in exceptional cases and
that Israel blatantly violates these
restrictions.

NCAA Tournamentbid last Mon-
day, it was a pleasant surprise.
The Wol-
verines had MICHAEL

time in 11 Basketball
years and
finally received the recognition
they'd hoped for.
But when Oklahoma easily
defeated Michigan in the first
round on Sunday, it was unpleas-
ant. And still a bit of a surprise.
Though the 11th-seeded Wol-
verines were the underdog, and
ultimately had to play a road
game since the first round took
place in Norman, Okla., they still
felt confident going into the game.
Their confidence didn't trans-
late into a victory, but that's
beside the point.
For one of the only times dur-
inghead coach Kevin Borseth's
tenure Michigan's first-round
contest put the program on the
national scene - which is a vic-
tory, but just a moral one.
But how can any loss for a
team that wanted more be a vic-
tory?
It's simple. For the past
decade, all of the best recruits
in the nation wouldn't even con-
sider playing for the Wolverines.
There was no reason for them
to. Michigan hadn't made the
NCAA Tournament in years, has
never won a Big Ten title and was
rarely even in contention for such
a championship.
The Wolverines were con-
tinually out-recruited by Big Ten
teams such as Michigan State,
Purdue and Ohio State nationally
and regionally.

caused Maloney to tinker with
how he plans to utilize his relief
pitching, as five different pitchers
each have earned a save, and none
of them have recorded more than
one.
Maloney hopes that Wood and
Smith can provide some stability
with their experience. In 2010,
Wood led the Wolverines with 21
appearances out of the bullpen.
And last year, Smith pitched four-
plus innings without allowing a
run before sitting out the rest of
the season.
Maloney has said that the fifth-
year seniors could be the team's
back-end pitchers in relief when
they become strong enough to
pitch multiple times in a series,
but neither has shown that ability
yet. In three appearances, Wood
has pitched less than two innings.
Smith has only made one appear-
ance so far this season.
Whatever, or whoever, the solu-
tion is, Maloney understands that
the bullpen needs to find it fast.
"I think one of the keys for the
team the rest of the year is going
to be 'can we finish games?' I am
very pleased with what we've
been getting from our starting
pitching - they've been doing
outstanding - but our bullpen has
been struggling."

Hoke carries hard-nosed mentality into spring

By STEPHENJ. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Five young men clenched the
chain-link fence atop the bleach-
ers at Phyllis Ocker Field, home
to the Michigan field hockey
team, and peered through.
The bleachers are located
directly adjacent to the football
practice fields outside Al Glick
Field House, providing a per-
fect vantage point for the fans to
watch practice.
The Michigan football team
was running its first practice of
the spring season under the mid-
Saturday sun, and it had already
drawn a crowd.
"Oh man, they're hitting
already," one onlooker said.
"And they've got the pads on,
too," added another.
They weren't. And they didn't.
But from 200 yards away you
couldn't tell.
Since his arrival in Janu-
ary 2011, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke has incessantly preached
toughness and physicality.
Though the pads won't be on for
a few days or weeks yet, Hoke
has brought the same mentality
into his second year at the helm.
"For us, I don't know if you
look at ita whole lot differently,"
Hoke said last Friday. "You're
always trying to meet expecta-
tions of competitiveness, tough-
ness, leadership, development
(and) discipline."
So what's changed in the past
year? Just about everything.
Hoke and his staff rallied the
7-6 Michigan team it inherited
to a surprising 11-2 record and a
Sugar Bowl victory. The expec-
tations haven't just shifted -

team."
On the flip side, the players get
to learn a little bit more about
their coaches.
A year ago, during Hoke's first
spring, three concepts whipped
out of Schembechler Hall with
alarming consistency - get 11
hats to the ball, finish every play
and hear football.
The concepts alone are sim-
ple enough. But the players had
to learn them, and Hoke made
sure they did. If a ball is loose,
it's yours. If the whistle hasn't
blown, you're still moving. And
if your hits don't pop, you're not
hitting hard enough.
"You learn a
little bit more
about your
football team."
That's where the five onlook-
ers had it wrong.
The key was that you couldn't
hear football on Saturday. If you
couldn't hear it, there were no
hits. If there were no hits, there
were no pads.
With or without pads, Hoke
knows how to motivate.
Because, more than anything,
members of Michigan's 'Team
133' have learned what drives
Hoke crazy.
"A guy not playing with tough-
ness and a guy not running to the
football," Hoke said. "That will
drive me crazy."

Michigan coach Brady Hoke propelled the Michigan football team to a11-2 season and Sugar Bowl victory in his first season as head coach in Ann Arbor.

they've skyrocketed.
For the Wolverines, those
expectations cannot be met
without a stout defense that
shows marked improvement.
The defensive numbers were
Michigan's biggest surprise last
season, as the unit vaulted from
the 107th-best scoring defense to
No. 6 in the nation.
But the departures of three
starting defensive linemen -
Ryan Van Bergen, Mike Martin

and Will Heininger - have left
the defensive front depleted.
The veteran faces will be
replaced with fresh, unproven
ones.
Fortunately for Hoke, the
trenches are his specialty, and
he's adamant that the linemen
will set the tone for the defense.
"No question about it," Hoke
said. "Your expectations don't
go down. They better increase
because the bar is always going

to be set high here at Michigan
and should be. Those expecta-
tions are for the position, not the
person who plays the position."
Hoke also understands that
the pressure will be ratcheted
higher after a breakout first sea-
son as head coach. And with a
season opener against reigning-
national champion Alabama
staring Michigan down just five
months away, spring camp won't
be a cakewalk.

Because even after a year of
unexpected success, there are
plenty of unknowns.
"As far as this team, Team 133,
I think we have a lot of questions.
I know I do," Hoke said.
"... I think we've had a good
winter. You can see some guys
developing, you can see some
guys really working hard, but I
think you put the pads on, spring
football, those things, you learn a
little bit more about your football
