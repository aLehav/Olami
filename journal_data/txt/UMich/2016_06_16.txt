Students chalk Diag in 
remembrance of lives lost

Requiem Mass calls for 
tolerance and resilience

Mayor speaks out against 
guns at Sunday vigil held 
by Ann Arbor residents 

By LYDIA MURRAY

Summer Managing News Editor

In response to the mass shooting in Orlan-

do early Sunday morning, students chalked a 
vigil on the Diag in remembrance of the vic-
tims.

Omar Mateen — who has claimed alle-

giance to ISIS — killed 50 and wounded 
53 after opening fire on a crowd at the gay 
nightclub Pulse at about 2 a.m. Sunday. 
Mateen was killed three hours later when 
police raided the club after he held dozens of 
people hostage.

This shooting resulted in the most deaths 

from a mass shooting in U.S. history. The 
previous largest shooting in the United 
States was the 2007 shooting at Virginia 
Tech, which ended in the killing of 32 people.

In his remarks to the nation, President 

Barack Obama noted the relatively relaxed 
gun control laws in the United States.

“This massacre is therefore a further 

reminder of how easy it is for someone to get 
their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot 
people in a school, or in a house of worship, 
or a movie theater, or in a nightclub,” he said. 
“And we have to decide if that’s the kind of 
country we want to be. And to actively do 
nothing is a decision as well.”

In an email to students, vice-president of 

student life E. Royster Harper issued her 
condolences to the familes of the victims and 
called for students to lean on one another in 
their own individual communities. 

Community rallies to 
put together memorial 
performance in 48 hours

By KEVIN LINDER

Daily Staff Reporter

In remembrance of the victims of the 

nation’s largest mass shooting last Sun-
day in Orlando, several hundred students, 
alumni, faculty and Ann Arbor commu-
nity members packed Hill Auditorium for 
a performance of Mozart’sRequiem. The 
event, titled “Requiem for Orlando,” drew 
a somber crowd to mourn the victims of 
the attack and their families and to stand 
in solidarity against the hatred behind the 
tragedy.

In a span of just 48 hours, Austin Stew-

art, a musicology graduate student at the 
University of Michigan, and Colin Knapp, 
a University alum who received his bach-
elor’s in music in 2014, enlisted nearly 
200 volunteer singers and musicians to 
perform Mozart’s Requiem for the event.

Prior to the beginning of the perfor-

mance, several guest speakers took the 
stage to pay their respects to the lives lost 
and to voice words of strength against 
social injustice and violence fueled by 
hate. Guest speakers included Univer-
sity President Mark Schlissel, Ann Arbor 
Mayor Christopher Taylor, School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance Dean Aaron 
Dworkin and LGTBQ community icon 
Jim Toy.

Schlissel offered sympathy to all those 

hurt, directly and indirectly, by the tragic 
events that occurred last Sunday. He also

AAPD chief questions 
police oversight board

Race, gender and 
culture influence fear 
of death in elderly 

Baird criticizes 

findings of Human 
Rights Commission 

report

By BRIAN KUANG 

and ISHI MORI

Daily Summer News Editor 

and Daily Staff Reporter

In a split with City Coun-

cil, which voted unanimously in 
March to consider a set of recom-
mendations put forth by its Human 
Rights Commission, Ann Arbor 
Police Chief Jim Baird questioned 
the need for increased civilian 
oversight of the AAPD in a memo 
to members of council last week. 
Baird 
also 
explicitly 
opposed 

the implementation of a civilian 
review board and alternate dis-
pute resolution mechanism until 
a third-party audit of the AAPD is 
completed.

Baird’s memo comes as the 

council is expected to finalize and 
formally vote on implementing 
recommendations from the HRC 
— which is composed of local resi-
dents appointed by the mayor and 
receives assistance from Univer-
sity of Michigan law students — in 
the coming month.

Efforts to reform oversight of 

AAPD increased after the 2014 
fatal shooting of unarmed local 
resident Aura Rosser by an AAPD 
officer. The Washtenaw County 

prosecutor ultimately chose not to 
indict the officer involved in the 
shooting, thoughmany local resi-
dents criticized the transparency 
of the investigation.

A study of best practices in 

police departments across the 
country and a public engagement 
process — in which Baird partici-
pated as interim chief — culminat-
ed in a 42-page report in late 2015 
from the HRC. The report rec-
ommended an independent audit 
of AAPD practices, the creation 
of a civilian oversight board, an 
emphasis on community policing 
and the implementation of crisis 
response teams.

Leslie Stambaugh, chair of the 

HRC, said she was not surprised 
by Baird’s opposition to the imple-
mentation of increased civilian 
oversight. Nonetheless, she said 
she intends to continue to push for 
an oversight board and is confident 
that it will ultimately be imple-
mented.

“I imagine that very few police 

chiefs would welcome review 
boards with civilian powers,” 
Stambaugh said. “He’s hoping the 
consultant will say, ‘Hey, you don’t 
need it, everything is fine.’ ”

In his memo to the council, 

Baird said the Rosser shooting, 
while tragic, was justified and 
does not reflect any broader issues 
within the AAPD. Baird also noted 
the only other incident mentioned 
in the HRC report took place in 
1995, when AAPD undertook a 

University 

study identifies 

demographics that 
influence attitudes

By ALEXA ST.JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

A recent University of Michi-

gan study shows that racial and 
gender differences can affect 
one’s death anxiety — or fear of 
death — and subsequently affect 
the best ways to reduce these 
feelings.

Death anxiety, an issue partic-

ularly prevalent in elderly people, 
reduces one’s well-being and will 
to live, according to the research. 
This negatively affects elderly 
patients and could potentially 
be a barrier to patient-caretaker 
communication.

According 
to 
the 
Geriat-

ric Mental Health Foundation, 

depression affects about 15 per-
cent of adults over the age of 65 
in the United States. This often 
results from one’s loss of senses or 
mobility, retirement or the death 
of a loved one. When untreated, 
depression — one of many mental 
health illnesses that can affect 
the elderly — can worsen other 
medical issues or lead to prema-
ture death due to a prolonged 
inability to physically or mentally 
function normally.

The University study was con-

ducted by Shervin Assari, the lead 
author and a psychiatric research 
investigator, who used data from 
a religion, aging and health sur-
vey from 2004. The survey repre-
sents a nationally representative 
assessment of 1,074 white and 
Black people over the age of 65 
who either identify as Christian 
or never associated with a reli-
gion or faith.

Previous studies have shown 

that people’s attitude toward

Local Sanders 

supporters remain 
divided in support of 

nominee 

By LYDIA MURRAY

Summer Managing News Editor

Following the Associated Press’ 

announcement of Hillary Clinton’s 
securing of the Democratic nomi-
nation for president and the fur-
ther affirmation of her place as the 
presumptive nominee after a series 
of key victories in Tuesday’s pri-
maries, supporters of Sen. Bernie 
Sanders (I–Vt.) expressed disap-
pointment.

Nicolas Kolenda, president of 

Students for Sanders, expressed 
that he believes many younger vot-
ers — who have been key supporters 
of Sanders — are largely upset by the 
outcome.

“If it could be summed up in one 

word, I think disappointment is 
the general consensus,” he wrote 
in an e-mail. “I might even go as 
far as saying that a plurality of mil-
lennials are feeling a bit down and 
out: in many states Sanders won an 
unprecedented proportion of mil-
lennials.”

Kolenda also stated his belief that 

the early call for the nomination 
Monday likely led to low voter turn-
out in Tuesday’s election, harming 
Sanders in key contests like Califor-
nia and New Jersey.

Sanders maintains that he will 

remain in the race until the July 
convention 
despite 
what 
now 

appears to be an impossible path to 
victory. Sanders’ reasoning for stay-
ing in the race stems from the tech-
nically unpledged superdelegates, 
who do not officially cast their votes 
until the convention. Clinton has a 
large lead over Sanders in this area, 
which has helped propel her to vic-
tory, and any viable chance that 
Sanders has at the election stems 
from a large number of these super-
delegates switching their support 
from Clinton to Sanders.

According to Charles Shipan, 

University of Michigan political 
science and public policy professor, 
though Sanders may still be holding 
onto his slim chance at the nomina-
tion, it is also likely that he hopes to 
stay in the race long enough to gain 
leverage in terms of getting issues 
that are important to him on the 
party agenda.

“More likely, what he is doing is 

angling for a platform where he gets 
a chance to speak at the convention 
and put forward his ideas where he 
gets the president or Hillary Clinton 
to endorse those ideas, or he gets 
those ideas put onto the Democratic 
Party platform,” he said. “He real-
izes that only in acting in this way 
he has enough leverage to put those 
ideas forward.”

Because of this, Shipan said 

Sanders will eventually move to 
endorse Clinton — the only question 
that remains is when he will do so. 
Additionally, Shipan believes the 
likelihood of a contested Democrat-
ic National Convention is incredibly 
low.

Supporters of Sanders remain 

divided on whether they will sup-
port Clinton in the general elec-

tion. According to Shipan, the vast 
majority of Sanders supporters will 
eventually move to back Clinton 
with a small fraction choosing not 
to vote and an even smaller frac-
tion voting for Republican nominee 
Donald Trump.

Kolenda said while he may not 

actively campaign for Clinton, he 
believes it is important to work for 
a Democratic victory in November.

“In terms of myself, I am not 

sure if I would campaign for Clin-
ton just yet,” he wrote. “My views 
on Clinton are lukewarm at best, so 
it’d be hard to take hours out of the 
day to do much for that campaign. 
However, myself and others will be 
trying my hardest to keep Trump 
out of office, and if the Students 
for Hillary or Campus Democrats 
groups need help to keep Michigan 
out of Trump’s hands, I’d be willing 
to help out. Many of us aren’t neces-
sarily pro-Clinton, but a vast major-
ity of us are incredibly anti-Trump.”

Pressure has been building on 

Sanders to endorse Clinton in order 
to unite the Democratic Party. 
President Barack Obama officially 
endorsed Clinton through a video 
posted to her Facebook page Thurs-
day following a meeting with Sand-
ers, in which he negotiated Sanders’ 
exit from the race.

“Look, I know how hard this job 

can be. That’s why I know Hillary 
will be so good at it,” Obama said in 
the video. “I don’t think there’s ever 
been someone so qualified to hold 
this office. She’s got the courage, the 
compassion and the heart to get the 
job done.”

According to Shipan, strides 

from both candidates will have to 

be taken in order to unite the Demo-
cratic Party under Clinton. Sanders, 
he said, needs to make his support 
for Clinton clear, while Clinton 
needs to embrace Sanders’ support-
ers and express her dedication to 
the same ideals.

Shipan said students on campus 

appeared to be split in terms their 
willingness to support Clinton, with 
some appearing happy with the suc-
cess Sanders saw, while others are 
angered with the lack of a complete 
victory. However, Shipan said the 
views of students may have changed 
since the end of the winter semester 
when he last interacted with them 
fully.

“During the semester, the under-

grads that I talked to who were 
in support of Sanders had a mix of 
views,” he said. “Some of them were 
pleased that he had done as well as 
he had done, and he had brought 
forward a bunch of issues that they 
thought were important, and even if 
he didn’t win, they were delighted 
with the way things had turned out. 
Others were feeling frustrated with 
the sense that the Democratic Party 
closed ranks around Hillary Clinton 
early and Sanders never really had a 
chance to win.”

Kolenda said that, looking for-

ward, Students for Sanders hopes to 
continue to keep students engaged 
in politics as the member begin to 
move in different directions.

“The goal is to keep people politi-

cally interested and involved,” he 
wrtoe. “People within Students for 
Sanders have various beliefs and 
ideologies. Some may aid Students 
for Hillary, others the Campus 
Democrats.”

death is influenced by their 
cultures and religions, usually 
tied to race and gender. Assari 
sought to further explore the 
differences in death anxiety 
between Blacks and whites 
caused by race, gender and cul-
ture. 

“We are not interested in 

how culture shapes our feelings 
or our behaviors, but we are 
looking at how culture changes 
the effects of our psychosocial 
factors, behaviors and feel-
ings on our health outcomes,” 
Assari said. “We don’t necessar-
ily believe that culture directly 
shapes our behaviors, feeling 
and health. We believe that cul-
ture changes the complex asso-
ciations that shape health in 
humans.”

The researchers measured 

death anxiety using partici-
pants’ responses to four state-
ments: “I find it hard to face 
up to the fact that I will die,” 
“Thinking about death makes 
me feel uneasy,” “I do not feel 
prepared to face my own death” 
and “I am disturbed by the 
shortness of life.” Participants 
responded to these statements 
using a scale from four (strong-
ly agree) to one (strongly dis-
agree).

The researchers also took 

into account the participants’ 
perceived control over life, 
demographics, 
socio-econom-

ics, number of physical health 
conditions, 
self-rated 
health 

and financial difficulty.

Ultimately, the study found 

that, while race and gender did 
not have a significant effect on 
death anxiety, they influenced 
factors associated with death 
anxiety, such as a number of 
physical health conditions and 
financial difficulty. While the 
results do not explain exactly 
why there are discrepancies in 
death anxiety among different 
people, it is significant to show 
these discrepancies exist for 
different races and genders. 

The study revealed that race 

and gender were different mod-
erating factors linked to death 
anxiety, something Assari said 
he believes resulted from the 
historical adversity Blacks have 
faced, leading to greater resil-
ience.

My throat was as dry as my feet 

were sore. I wedged my way upstairs 
through 
sweaty 
dancing 
bodies 

and walked into the room of a guy I 
considered a friend. I was just going to 
grab water and that’s when he grabbed 
me. He clasped his arm tightly around 
my waist and pulled me toward his bed, 
attempting to lock the door behind me. 
I was close enough to smell the alcohol 
on his breath and hear his soft slurred 
plea, “Come on.” That’s when I got the 
hell out of there.

The following morning I woke up 

in the comfort of my own bed, but I 
wondered what would have happened 
if I weren’t in a position to defend 
myself. I wondered if the height of my 
shoes or fit of my jeans would have 
made a difference. I wondered if what 
I ate, what I drank or how I danced 
would have mattered. I wondered if 
the exposed skin on my chest and arms 
would have exposed me as someone 
other than a victim if I were sexually 
assaulted that night.

Fortunately, wondering was the 

extent of my worry. I moved on from 
that night and eventually forgot it as 
easily as I forget my keys on the way to 
class. When news broke about Brock 
Turner, the former Stanford swimmer 
charged with sexual assault of an 
unconscious woman, I was reminded. 
A nauseating thought crossed my mind 
as I read the horrifying details — that 
woman could have been me.

People bear a certain amount of 

responsibility to protect themselves, 
but a girl’s vulnerability doesn’t signal 
a free shot at some “action.” The public 
outrage over Turner’s six-month 
sentence is proof that a large amount 
of people agree. USA Swimming even 
banned the 20-year-old athlete from 
membership for life. However, in this 
case, the U.S. legal system took a highly 
scrutinized stance toward crimes 
involving sexual assaults on college 
campuses: if you are rich, if you are 
white and if you are athletically gifted, 
then you are in luck.

Part of the reason the decision in 

this case is infuriating is because it 
sympathizes with the wrong person. 
Honestly, who cares if Turner had a 
bright future? We’re talking about a 
guy who was found guilty for three 
counts of sexual assault. The fact that 
six months is even a possibility for 
a sentence to this crime minimizes 
the damaging effects on the victim 
and unveils systematic inequalities 
embedded in our legal system.

Last April, Corey Batey, an African 

American male and former Vanderbilt 
football player, was found guilty for 
aggravated rape and two counts of 
aggravated sexual battery against an 
unconscious woman. Just like Turner, 
Batey was a successful 19-year-old 
student athlete and had been drinking 
when he committed the crime. 
However, Batey’s punishment was 
vastly different. About three years after 
his initial arrest, he was sentenced with 
a minimum of 15 to 25 years in prison.

A consistent agreement about 

the role a person’s past plays in the 
courtroom doesn’t exist, but in the case 
of sexual assault, the law should not be 
subjective, especially not by race.

Paul Wallin, California criminal 

defense attorney and founding partner 
of Wallin & Klarich said, “(Turner’s) 
punishment is he’s lost his college 
education, he’s going to have to register 
as a sex offender, which is basically 
going to ruin his life. He can’t even 
apply to get off registration for about 13 
years from now.”

Urinating in public lands a person 

a spot on the sex offenders list. It’s not 
a punishment. It’s a result of certain 
behavior, and hearing the sympathy 
that exists for Turner is disheartening. 
Batey also lost his scholarship and 
college education, but he was not 
shown leniency in the courtroom, nor 
should he have been. Race, class or 
socioeconomic status shouldn’t dictate 
a person’s punishment, but Turner 
was able to use those factors to his 
advantage.

According to California law, he 

should be serving a minimum of three 

years in prison. Turner was found 
guilty. Even worse, he prolonged the 
process by denying his guilt and taking 
the woman he sexually assaulted to 
trial. It’s true Turner had no prior 
convictions, but that doesn’t lessen the 
impact of his crime. A denial of guilt 
doesn’t show remorse or cooperation. 
It shows a coward. He ran away from 
an unconscious girl, just like he ran 
away from responsibility.

What disturbs me the most is 

how Turner claimed the victim was 
enjoying herself beside the dumpster. 
What a sad effort to save himself. 
Anyone who sexually assaults a 
woman and claims she enjoyed it 
deserves to rot in prison, no matter 
how fast he glides through water.

Ironically, Turner exhibited a 

complete lack of accountability, while 
the victim was held accountable for 
her decision to drink. In her letter to 
Turner, she wrote, “Alcohol is not an 
excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol 
was not the one who stripped me, 
fingered me, had my head dragging 
against the ground, with me almost 
fully naked. Having too much to drink 
was an amateur mistake that I admit 
to, but it is not criminal.”

Drinking is not the cause of sexual 

assault. 
Though 
alcohol 
impairs 

judgment, being drunk doesn’t excuse 
crime. If it did, there’d be a whole lot 
less DUIs administered.

But unlike a DUI, drinking isn’t the 

root of the problem. Plenty of college 
students 
drink 
without 
sexually 

assaulting others. The problem is that 
drinking has turned into a means 
of deflecting blame away from the 
attacker and toward the victim. If a 
woman victim was drunk, she has to 
defend herself against the blurred lines 
of consent. Maybe she said yes. Maybe 
she wanted it to happen. Oh, she was 
wearing a skirt? She must have been 
asking for it.

“She put herself in the position 

to be found next to a dumpster,” 
Wallin said. “She drank to three 
times the legal limit. People at that

Donor discrimination

In the wake of the tragedy that 

occurred at the Pulse nightclub in 
Orlando over the weekend, many of 
the 53 injured are in need of blood 
from local hospitals, whether this 
be for a loss of blood during the 
shooting or to complete lifesaving 
surgeries. With the extent of 
injuries 
requiring 
blood 
from 

donations, local hospitals called 
out for volunteers to donate blood. 
However, not everyone who wants 
to help save those lives is allowed 
to do so.

As a volunteer for the American 

Red Cross and a frequent blood 
donor, I am not unaccustomed to 
the policies of the Red Cross during 
blood donation. There are many 
restrictions. Donors cannot have 
been to areas where Malaria has 
been found in the last 12 months. 
Donors cannot have gotten a new 
tattoo in the last 12 months. Donors 
cannot have had sex for money 
since 1977. Donors cannot be male 
and have had sex with another male 
in the last 12 months, among many 
other eligibility requirements. This 
last requirement greatly limits the 
potential for people to be helped 
in the wake of a tragedy when the 
community that the victims belong 
to are barred from aiding in the 
process of saving lives.

In December 2015, the FDA 

revised 
the 
blood 
donation 

eligibility requirement from not 
allowing males who have had 
sexual contact with another male 
since 1977 to donate within the 
last year. The FDA guideline for 
blood donation now requires that 
individuals, “Defer for 12 months 
from the most recent contact a man 
who has had sex with another man 
during the past 12 months. Defer 
for 12 months from the most recent 

contact a female who has had sex 
during the past 12 months with a 
man who has had sex with another 
man in the past 12 months.” Males 
who chose to have sex with other 
males should not automatically be 
assumed to have been in contact 
with HIV. This may have been a 
major concern when HIV was first 
encountered, but it is not a proper 
indicator of HIV status and should 
not be included in modern policies.

So many people are affected by 

a shortage in blood nationwide. 
We should be actively looking 
for ways to increase the supply 
we have, and that should involve 
making a more inclusive donation 
requirement procedure. The type 
of sex a person choses to have 
should not dictate whether a 
person is eligible to save three lives, 
especially when the need is urgent, 
such as when local hospitals and 
donation centers are calling out 
for residents to participate after 
a tragedy. Everyone who has sex 
is susceptible to contracting HIV, 
but not all people who have sex 
are banned from donating blood. 
All blood is screened before being 
given 
to 
another 
individual, 

making the current regulations 
unnecessary and discriminatory.

While the Red Cross suggests 

those who are unable to make a 
donation of blood instead make a 
monetary donation, discriminatory 
policies cannot and should not 
be tolerated. Such policies only 
encourage homophobia in a society 
that needs to change in the wake 
of a national event victimizing 
a 
targeted 
and 
stereotyped 

community.

level sometimes die.”

People who share this opinion 

are part of the reason sexual assault 
cases remain largely underreported. 
However, the nationwide support the 
victim continues to receive is a clear 
sign that not all people feel this way.

Even if the efforts to recall Judge 

Persky fail, the voice of a brave victim 

has already spoken out and sparked a 
conversation. She has replaced silence 
with strength for every girl who has 
experienced a close call, every girl 
who has shared a similar suffering 
and every girl who has feared facing 
further victimization.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS


I 

attended my sister’s high 
school graduation on Sunday, 
June 12, and listened to 

speeches 
on 

hope 
and 

positive societal 
change 
in 
a 

crowd 
filled 

with many about to begin their adult 
lives.

In the same 24 hours, the 

United States suffered its largest 
mass shooting in history with a 
homophobic hate crime resulting in 
the loss of 50 lives and the injury of 
53 others at the Pulse, a gay nightclub 
in Orlando that was filled with many 
enjoying Latin Night. In the same 48 
hours, singer Christina Grimmie was 
shot while meeting fans after her 
concert in Orlando.

What happened to Christina 

Grimmie and what happened with 
the homophobic killings in Pulse 
have caused a sense of complete 
frustration — my heart is aching 
that these tragedies are so common. 
Every single day horrific events are 
occurring — the disgusting truth is 
that, for many of us, there is a high 
chance we will not know about 
them if the lives impacted are not 
valued by mainstream media, do not 
impact members of our immediate 
communities or do not impact those 
in our lives. We must recognize this 
as a fault, not try to justify it and take 
active steps to remedy it by being 
proactive consumers of information.

After these two tragedies, many 

have been sending their thoughts 
and 
prayers. 
But 
while 
some 

might find that comforting, what 
substantive action will follow and 
be implemented to make sure we, 
as a society, are doing everything 
we can to prevent gun violence and 
to protect those in the LGBTQIA+ 
community? 

For starters, each of us must do 

our part of recognizing the beliefs 
and behaviors that stem from 
homophobia and hatred in our own 
communities — an example being one 
ignoring the overlap of LGBTQIA+ , 
racial and religious identities. Audre 
Lorde once said, “Within the lesbian 
community I am Black, and within 
the Black community I am a lesbian. 
Any attack against Black people is a 

lesbian and gay issue, because I and 
thousands of other Black women are 
part of the lesbian community. Any 
attack against lesbians and gays is 
a Black issue, because thousands of 
lesbians and gay men are Black.” If we 
play a part in the creation of binaries 
— making it seem as if these identities 
are mutually exclusive — we are 
responsible for causing many to be 
silent when they otherwise would 
be steadfast in their solidarity. If we 
recognize the rooted problems in our 
communities that oppress members 
within and outside our communities, 
we have a responsibility to do what 
we can to eradicate it if we can do 
so without putting our physical, 
emotional and mental safety at risk. 
How could we live with ourselves if 
we could and did not?

While our LGBTQIA+ brothers 

and sisters are being killed, how 
can we genuinely call ourselves 
lovers of humanity if we’re staying 
silent? When another life is lost and 
yet again nothing changes for gun 
control, how can we say we really 
want to put an end to shootings if 
we’re staying silent?

These feelings — these moments 

of complete and utter shock over how 
cruel mankind can be — will never go 
away. We will unfortunately always 
find moments of genuine beauty 
and clarity in our lives being put to 
an end when suddenly we feel our 
hearts breaking and find ourselves 
staring at a news headline wanting to 
scream. I can’t pretend that this pain 
is temporary and that if we all held 
hands it would stop. It’s what we feel 
we can do with these feelings that 
matters and lessens the frequency 
of deaths and injustice motivated by 
hate.

“I am only one, but I am still one. I 

cannot do everything, but still I can 
do something. And because I cannot 
do everything I will not refuse to 
do the something that I can do,” 
the student speaker at Salem High 
School’s graduation said, quoting 
Helen Keller to a graduating class of 
more than 1,000. 

Afterward, 
I 
spoke 
with 
a 

graduating senior, Patricia Freitag, in 
the crowd.

“I’m livid,” she told me. “I’m really 

angry at how this country has let 

things get this far, how I have stood 
by and mourned for the families but 
never actively done something.”

We are all one, but together, we 

are all bodies of change and a future 
that doesn’t have to learn about 
yet another mass killing, another 
injustice, another act of hate every 
single day.

“The 
first 
step 
is 
bringing 

awareness,” Freitag said. “People say 
that there’s no point in retweeting 
things, but look at the huge platform 
it’s given younger generations — a 
platform that others cannot ignore 
and goes worldwide. There’s also 
petitioning, signing and writing to your 
representatives and local governments, 
which many seem to ignore because 
they believe one signature or one call 
is too small. But if everyone whose 
signature was so minuscule made 
that small dent, collectively we could 
make one of the largest impacts our 
generation has ever seen.” 

My heart goes out to all who lost 

loved ones as a result of homophobic 
mass shooting in Orlando — to those 
who have been severely traumatized 
and impacted by the aftermath. 
My heart goes out to those in the 
LGBTQIA+ community who are in the 
closet and couldn’t publicly grieve, seek 
comfort from their loved ones or solace 
from their friends and who were once 
again forced to suffer through pain and 
heartbreak alone. My heart goes out to 
to the Muslims who may experience 
Islamophobia as a result of this — 
especially those at the intersection of 
the LGBTQIA+ and Muslim identity. 
My heart goes out to to the family and 
loved ones of Christina Grimmie, to 
her big brother who had to watch his 
little sister die and her fans who saw 
someone they loved shot right before 
their eyes.

To those of you who are able, who 

are feeling a hundred emotions at 
once and who want to genuinely help 
prevent things like this in the future, 
please speak up and do what you can 
when you hear or see hate. People’s 
lives — their hopes, dreams and loved 
ones — are depending on it. I am still 
only one, and so are you, but together 
we’ll make a powerful many.

I am still one

KARIZAT

Ending the cycle

Like we do after every other 

tragedy, every other mass shooting 
(this past Saturday’s being the 176th 
mass shooting this year alone, and 
the most fatal in American history 
save the mass slaughters of Native 
Americans), we will first mourn. 
We’re told by news outlets that 50 
people died and even more were 
injured in a shooting at an LGBT 
nightclub in Orlando, and that 26 
kindergarten students and faculty 
were shot dead in Newtown. People 
will reprimand those who are 
angered in Facebook threads on news 
articles, telling them to be human 
and mourn first before making it 
a political issue. Your Facebook 
friends and Twitter followers will 
share articles about the tragedy and 
post heartfelt prayers, and these 
depressing posts will dominate your 
news feed.

Next, it’s time for the outrage. 

We are told who the shooter is, 
their history and relationships are 
revealed and their face is plastered 
on articles and television reports 
from The New York Times and 
CNN. People will get in fights on the 
Internet over what went wrong. If 
the perpetrator is revealed to have 
had ties to ISIS or another extremist 
group, there’s chatter about Islam 
being poison and all Muslims being 
terrorists, and people will either 
vehemently agree or disagree. Some 
people will bring up mental health, 
while others will discuss gun control. 
Invariably, there will be unbridled 
anger on the Internet. Other than the 
occasional peacemaker, mourning 
will have been forgotten by now. 
Instead of remembering the victims, 
we will have given attention to the 
perpetrator — exactly what this 
person wanted.

Then, it’s time to make a move in 

the game of politics. Most politicians 
will release messages that express 
sentiments of sadness and immense 
human loss, some will be outraged 
and swear to improve the gun 
control laws in our country, some 
will angrily talk about finally getting 
rid of radical groups and terrorism 
and some will pat themselves on the 
back even when the situation calls for 
grief. If it’s an election year, everyone 
has to be on their best, most political 
and, dare I say it, presidential 
behavior. Most of the statements 
they make are supposed to represent 
our best interests, our own personal 
desires for a call for action, whatever 
this action may be. The optimistic 

parts of us all hope that maybe this 
time there will be a huge change 
that stops a tragedy like this from 
happening again. The anger turns 
into petitions and opinion pieces — 
much like this one.

That’s the problem. It stops there. 

Too soon, these precious lives lost 
will be forgotten. Too soon, we’ll be 
back to life as we know it, wrapped 
up in our own little worlds. Too 
soon, the same politicians who 
expressed outrage and sadness and 
a need for action will stop talking 
about the tragedy, let alone doing 
something about it. But it’s not just 
the politicians who don’t remain 
accountable — none of us do. We 
are the ones electing these people. 
We are the ones exuding racism, 
sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, 
transphobia and every other phobia 
out there. We are the ones who 
embrace freedom but only ascribe 
it to people selectively. Going back 
to the status quo of hypocrisy and 
hidden malice toward the “other” 
sends a message to those looking to 
harm innocents that they have an 
opening and that they can easily get 
away with it because we’re distracted 
by our fears, our prejudices and 
our melodrama of a presidential 
campaign. Is that the way we want 
to live?

I’ve been impacted enough by 

my own hidden prejudices, even if 
only marginally, due to my many 
privileged identities; I’ve been called 
names because of my Indian origin 
— including one several years ago 
that was said with the mistaken 
assumption that I’m Muslim — and 
I’ve been told overtly that I can’t 
code well just because I’m a woman. 
My acquaintances and friends in the 
LGBTQ community are afraid that 
our country is taking a step back from 
same-sex marriage legality due to one 
person’s hateful crime, and they are 
terrified of copycat attacks and other 
repercussions. My Muslim-American 
acquaintances and friends are afraid 
that they will be even less welcome 
in their homes than before, maybe 
even dangerously so. When we make 
our own residents feel unsafe and 
discriminated against based on their 
own identities, how can we move on 
to actually take action when people do 
disgusting, sad things like this?

Talk is cheap. If we want to 

actually be progressive, we need to 
actually make a move. Let’s live up 
to the emotions we’re feeling about 
this horrific tragedy. Let’s start by 

educating ourselves on social justice 
and making this a truly equal playing 
field for all. Let’s start by getting rid of 
the “phobias” mentioned earlier that 
fester in our cities and towns. Let’s 
start by taking charge of the ideas and 
attitudes we spew, intentionally or not, 

to those who have different identities 
than we do. And let’s hold not only the 
perpetrators but also ourselves and 
others accountable when tragedies 
like Saturday night happen, at all 
levels — interpersonal, community, 
state, national and international. I’m 

absolutely fed up with this. And I hope 
you’re all just as fed up as I am, and that 
you will consider this a desperate plea 
for action and accountability.

TV REVIEW

‘Love’ in the Arb

By MERIN MCDIVITT

Daily Arts Writer

Nichols Arboretum is always 

teeming with visitors during the 
summer — among them are picnick-
ers camped out 
near the Huron 
River, 
tanners 

stretched out on 
sun-bleached 
towels and kay-
akers 
trying, 

and failing, to 
avoid the boul-
der 
everyone 

seems 
to 
get 

stuck on. On 
weekend 
eve-

nings in June, 
though, the Arb 
will take on a 
decidedly more 
romantic 
tone 

as the sunlight dims and Shake-
spearean lovers scatter throughout 
the shadowy woods.

This month marks the 16th year of 

Shakespeare in the Arb, the beloved 
festival that takes place through the 
end of June. Directed by Kate Men-
deloff of the Residential College, this 
year’s play, “Love’s Labour’s Lost,” 
takes audience members on a jour-
ney through the Arb itself, providing 
an immersive theatergoing experi-
ence that draws more lovers — of 
Shakespeare, that is — every year.

“There’s this sense that you enter 

this world of the King’s Park,” Men-
deloff said of the summer’s pro-
duction, which highlights one of 
Shakespeare’s earliest plays. “I try to 
create a 360-degree experience for 
the audience.”

The play, which centers around 

the King of Navarre and his cronies, 
is set in a forest, making the Arb 
the ideal setting. As the play moves 
around the woods and valleys, the 
audience follows the earnest hijinks 
of the king and his friends as they 
take a vow of celibacy, only to be 
happily thwarted by their romantic 
interests. While no one could have 

predicted 2016 would be a land-
mark year for women, from feminist 
Beyoncé to Hillary Clinton, this play 
goes along perfectly with our “Year 
of Women.”

“It has a lot of great roles for 

women,” Mendeloff said, drawing 
attention to some of its humorous 
feminist winks. “The women are so 
much [more clever] than the men.” 

A new, fresh concept when it 

first appeared in 2000, the festi-
val has displayed remarkable stay-
ing power and a sense of history. 
Unseasoned performers join every 
year, providing new blood and con-
temporary perspectives, but other 
collaborators, like Mendeloff, have 
participated in the program since 
its inception.

One woman in particular left her 

indelible mark upon Shakespeare 
in the Arb — Roberta Vander-
mey served as the show’s costume 
director for nearly a decade, craft-
ing many of the show’s delicate, 
exquisite garments, before passing 
away several years ago. She chose 
to be buried right next door to her 
beloved Arb in Forest Hill Cem-
etery, the lush, peaceful graveyard 
that shares its border with the park. 
Every year, Mendeloff and her col-
laborators leave flowers on Vander-
mey’s grave before opening night.

“It’s this ritual that we really 

love,” she said.

Dotted with flowering trees and 

visited by occasional deer, the cem-
etery is perhaps the quietest spot 
in the city, the hush interrupted 
every once in awhile by traffic from 
the streets nearby and the muf-
fled sound of feet on damp grass. 
By summer nightfall, even these 
sounds have fallen away and For-
est Hill is silent. But next time you 
walk home on Geddes Road at dusk, 
down the hill and past the wrought 
iron fence lining the graveyard, lis-
ten closely. Carried on the wind is 
the soft rustle of gossamer and chif-
fon, and maybe someone, flowers 
in hand, is straining her ears to the 
east for the closing lines of a sonnet. 

Tony Awards joyful in 
face of adverse times

Winners and 

performers alike 
celebrate year in 

theatre

By ALEX INTNER

Summer Managing Arts Editor

This 
year’s 
Tony 
Awards 

had 
an 
immensely 
difficult 

task. They had to take on the 
evening after 
the 
deadliest 

shooting 
in 

American 
history. 
However, they 
didn’t 
back 

down. Instead, 
the Broadway 
community 
came together 
and put on a genuine celebration 
of the theatrical medium. The 
Tonys are always my favorite of 
the four major awards shows. 
Not only does everyone seem 
happy to be there and showcase 
their work for the national 
audience, but the winners bring 
an authentic sense of joy to 
their moments. After a powerful 
opening acknowledgement by 
host James Corden (“The Late 
Late Show,” who said “all we 
can say is you’re not on your 
own right now. Your tragedy is 
our tragedy”), the show went 
on. This year’s Tonys brought 
a sense of happiness that was 
necessary on a day like Sunday.

The host of an awards show 

is one of the most thankless 
jobs on television, but Corden 
embraced the position, bringing 
his immense skill set to the job. 
He was asked to sing, dance, tell 
jokes and deliver moments of 
solace to a grieving audience. He 
attacked each of these challenges 
with 
charm, 
charisma 
and 

gravitas. His opening number, 
while a little long, launched 
the 
night 
with 
enthusiasm 

and energy, as Corden moved 
through snippets from classic 
musicals in rapid succession and 
danced his way into our hearts. 
He also got to show off his 
more comedic side, with little 

bits during the show, including 
ones 
where 
he 
showcased 

presenter Josh Groban’s high 
school performance as Tevye in 
“Fiddler on the Roof,” and the 
amount of people in the theatre 
community who have been on 
“Law & Order” by displaying 
pictures of them on the show. 
He also introduced Andrew 
Rannells 
and 
Glenn 
Close 

dressed as Donald Trump and 
Hillary Clinton in “The Book 
of Moron” and “A Clinton Line” 
respectively.

It wasn’t just Corden who 

brought 
energy; 
the 
other 

performances 
from 
the 

nominated shows brought their 
best to the Beacon Theatre 
stage. The performances on the 
Tonys are consistently some of 
the best moments from awards 
shows, as Broadway shows share 
themselves with the national 
audience. This year’s ceremony 
brought us Audra McDonald tap 
dancing during a performance 
from “Shuffle Along.” The kids 
from Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 
adaptation of “School of Rock,” 
who play their instruments live 
on stage, shined in a similar way 
to how the cast of “Matilda” 
stole the show a few years ago. 
The cast of the closed revival 
of 
“Spring 
Awakening” 
also 

brought their American Sign 
Language-infused choreography 
to the telecast. Jane Krakowski, 
Zachary Levi and Laura Benanti 
also 
brought 
their 
fantastic 

performances in “She Loves Me” 
to the stage. (Levi’s enthusiasm 
as he sings “She Loves Me” 
will never fail to make me 
smile). Personally, the way that 
production incorporated deaf 
cast members and ASL into the 
show (it’s entirely signed or 
captioned) changed the way 
musicals could be done for me 
when I saw it in December. 
There also was no shortage 
of 
emotional 
showstoppers, 

as Heather Headley, Danielle 
Brooks 
and 
the 
immensely 

talented Cynthia Erivo brought 
their huge voices to a number 
from “The Color Purple” and 
Jessie Mueller made me cry 
during her performance of “She 
Used to Be Mine” from Sara 

Bareilles’s “Waitress.” 

Other highlights from the 

show came from its speeches, as 
the winners brought enthusiasm 
and gravity to their celebratory 
moments. A couple of winners 
brought up the shootings earlier 
that 
day. 
When 
Lin-Manuel 

Miranda won the Tony for Best 
Original Score for writing the 
music and lyrics of “Hamilton,” 
he performed a sonnet where 
he wrote: “When senseless acts 
of tragedy remind us nothing 
here is promised. Not one day. 
This show is proof that history 
remembers. … Love is love is love 
is love is love cannot be killed 
or swept aside.” Frank Langella, 
after winning Lead Actor in a 
Play for his performance as an 
elderly man with dementia in 
“The Father,” went up on stage 
and said: “I urge you, Orlando, to 
be strong because I’m standing in 
a room full of the most generous 
human beings on Earth and we 
will be with you every step of 
the way.” His words show how 
powerful live events like this can 
be, attempting to bring comfort 
in a difficult time.

However, the night belonged 

to “Hamilton,” which not only 
took home 11 awards (one short 
of 2001 record set by “The 
Producers”), but its cast also 
opened and closed the show. It’s 
no surprise that they dominated 
the awards, as the show is the 
biggest hit Broadway has seen 
in years. In fact, the ceremony 
gained two million viewers year-
to-year, showcasing the clear 
impact “Hamilton” has had on 
the broader theater culture.

While talking to friends after 

the ceremony about the horrific 
events earlier in the day, I 
realized what this year’s Tonys 
provided. The ceremony showed 
the power theater has to be a 
place for people to forget what’s 
happening. They made me laugh 
and they made me cry from 
the powerful emotions in the 
performances. At its best, theater 
whisks you away into another 
world. It makes you forget your 
problems and the problems of 
the world. This year’s Tonys was 
a beacon of joy and celebration in 
a day surrounded by sadness.

Bey’s lively ‘Formation’

CONCERT REVIEW

By ADAM THEISEN

Managing Arts Editor

As I took my seat Tuesday night 

for Beyoncé’s Formation Tour at 
Ford Field, my mind jumped to the 
movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” 
Dominating the stage before Bey 
graced it with her presence was 
an 
enormous, 
bright 
rectangle 

that nearly reached the football 
stadium’s ceiling. It reminded me of 
“the monolith,” a similarly imposing 
artifact of mysterious origin in 
“2001” that always seems to appear 
when the human race is on the verge 
of a huge new advancement.

It may be slightly hyperbolic to 

say Beyoncé is a full evolutionary 
step ahead of the rest of us, but I’m 
not exaggerating when I say her 
show was unlike anything I had 
ever seen. The Formation Tour is an 
extravaganza of world-class dance, 
technical wizardry and incredible 
music.

And it was like that from the very 

beginning. The crowd shrieked at 
the very first sign of movement, 
as the rectangle began to spin and 
pulsate, flashing images of Bey. Her 
dancers came out from behind to 
the first notes of “Formation,” the 
Queen herself appeared onstage 
and nobody in the audience could 
recover for the rest of the night. It 
was wild and loud from the front 
to the back, with cameras flashing 
from every corner and the bass 
turned up so high I could feel my 
throat shaking. Just the opening 
run included anthems like “Sorry,” 
“Bow Down” and “Run the World 
(Girls).” Within three songs, Bey had 
already shot off literal fireworks, 
when any other artist who brings 
fireworks always has to save them 
for the finale.

One of the many things that makes 

a Beyoncé show so unique is Bey 
doesn’t need to prove herself to you. 
She’s possessed by an unshakeable 
confidence gained from decades of 
hard work, and her fans love her 
unconditionally. If you’re not happy 
at her show, then that’s entirely your 
problem. Beyoncé yelling out, “Are 
y’all having a good time tonight?” 
would be like the Mona Lisa asking 
if you think she’s pretty — she 
knows she’s the queen, and she’s 
performing for her own art, not for 
any kind of validation.

That’s not to say she’s ungrateful 

in any way — far from it. You can’t 
hide any emotions when your face 
is on 200-foot tall screens, and 

Beyoncé was beaming whenever 
she looked out at the crowd — that 
kind of smile-with-your-eyes you 
can’t fake. She took the time, too, to 
recall her early days when Destiny’s 
Child was performing in front of 
grocery stores, and she made sure 
every woman at the show knew how 
special she was.

“There’s no such thing as a weak 

woman,” she preached.

Beyoncé 
is 
revolutionary 
in 

ways both big and seemingly small. 
Of course, this type of show is 
unprecedented — there’s a point 
where she literally walks on water! 
But she also employed the first Black 
female rhythm section I had ever 
seen in a pop concert, a nice change 
of pace from the token band of white 
dudes

And if she wasn’t there already, 

Lemonade has pushed Beyoncé past 
the point where her setlist can leave 
out massive hit songs and still be all 
killer and no filler — there was no 
“Irreplaceable,” no “6 Inch,” not even 
“Single Ladies,” for the love of God. 
But Bey made it feel like nothing was 
missing. She effortlessly hopped 
from hits to major album tracks and 
back to hits from all over her career, 
almost turning the whole show into 
a lengthy-but-coherent medley that 
occasionally was broken up by dance 
showcases and video interludes, 
courtesy of “Lemonade,” the film. 
With the lack of certain tracks, the 
concert never quite became the all-
out dance party it could have been, 
but signature songs like “Drunk 
in Love” and Destiny’s Child’s 
“Survivor” sounded reinvigorated 
by Beyoncé’s live energy, even 
though everyone in the stadium 
had surely heard them hundreds of 
times before.

While there were plenty of 

flashy effects and backing tracks, 
absolutely nobody could come out 
of Ford Field criticizing Beyoncé’s 
voice, unless somehow they went 
temporarily deaf for “Love on Top.” 
She did the a capella of a Whitney-
Houston-esque track from 4 on the 
B-Stage, surrounded by fans who 
got louder and louder as the song 
progressed. At the song’s climax, 
she repeats the refrain over and 
over, going up a pitch each time. 
It’s impressive enough on the 
record, where Bey presumably had 
unlimited takes to perfect it, but 
seeing her do it live without anything 
behind her, filling up the biggest 
room in Detroit with only her voice, 
was the most stunning moment 

I’ve ever experienced at a concert. 
It was like watching Steph Curry 
make his signature off-balance 
corner three-pointers. As each 
refrain approached, I instinctively 
knew Bey’s shot was going in, but I 
still found myself thinking, “This is 
unbelievable” every time she sang it.

Though the show was so tightly 

choreographed that there’s no way 
it changes much from city to city, 
Beyoncé took a moment to shout out 
Motown. When she talked about 
how stars like Diana Ross paved 
the way for her, it highlighted an 
interesting split in Yoncé’s musical 
personality. Beyoncé has scaled new 
heights in her career by pushing the 
boundaries of pop music with her 
last two albums, but she still reveres 
the classics. The two songs she told 
the crowd were her favorites to sing 
on tour — “Me, Myself and I” and 
“1+1” — would both sound at home 
on Janet Jackson and Etta James 
records, respectively.

It was fitting, then, that she didn’t 

close with a banger but with “Halo,” 
which she dedicated to the Orlando 
shooting victims and their families. 
Normally, it’s far from one of my 
favorites, but Beyoncé seems to 
live just to sing that song in front of 
50,000 people. Where it’s cheesy on 
the record, Beyoncé’s powerful live 
voice makes it earnest, joyful and 
inspiring. If you had told me before 
the show that “Halo” was her final 
song, I would have been skeptical, 
but now, I can’t imagine any other 
song taking its place.

I don’t know what more I can 

say to truly summarize Beyoncé’s 
greatness. I could talk about how 
unreal it felt to gaze in person 
upon a global icon. And I want to 
mention that my friend ranked this 
concert as one of her “Top 10 Life 
Experiences,” and I’m not sure if I’m 
that all-in, but it’s definitely a show 
I’ll remember for the rest of my life. I 
should say, too, I was almost brought 
to tears hearing Beyoncé perfectly 
belt out “Halo” with all she had just 
a few days after the absolute despair 
that was Orlando. But if you love 
Beyoncé, then you know exactly 
what kind of beyond-words power 
she has, and I can probably shut up 
now.

In short, just to reiterate and 

remind myself that this actually 
happened, I saw Beyoncé, and I 
could never see another concert 
again and still be satisfied. If not 
fully evolved, I feel changed, and I 
feel complete.

‘Conjuring 2’ a 
chilling sequel

By ALEX INTNER

Summer Managing Arts Editor

When looking for someone to 

see “The Conjuring 2” with me, I 
kept getting the same response: “I 
don’t do hor-
ror 
movies.” 

By nature of 
the film being 
in the horror 
genre, 
people 

didn’t want to 
see it. I don’t 
consider myself 
to be a “horror-
movie person” 
either. Still, when I watched “The 
Conjuring” on a random night on 
HBO, I was engrossed. It was a 
well-made movie which not only 
scared, but impressed with its 
technical work and storytelling. 
It’s the type of movie where, even 
if I’m not a horror fan, I could still 
appreciate it. The sequel’s ghost 
story, releasing three years after 
the first one, doesn’t quite pack the 
same punch as the first one, but it 
still maintained the same cinemat-
ic quality that made the first one 
such an engaging watch.

“The Conjuring 2” again follows 

Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick 
Wilson, “A Gifted Man” and Vera 
Farmiga, “Bates Motel”), who this 
time travel to England to investi-
gate eerie events happening in a 
London house. The Hodgson fam-
ily are being terrorized by an evil 
spirit, who takes possession of their 
daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe, 
“True Detective”).

It’s in its story where “The Con-

juring 2” falters a bit, as it struggles 
with its character work amid a 
ghost story that isn’t quite as chill-
ing as the first. In this iteration, 
the franchise puts more of a focus 
on the Warrens, as if they realized 
they needed to build up the charac-

ters if they’re going to be the focus 
of the franchise. Only some of that 
characterization worked. The film 
cleverly interplays a ghost haunt-
ing Lorraine with the Enfield spir-
it, but when the focus turns to the 
Warren’s romance, the story stops 
dead in its tracks. Moments that 
are supposed to come off as roman-
tic feel out-of-place with the tone 
of other scenes in the film. Wilson 
and Farmiga try their hardest, but 
they still aren’t able to sell these 
scenes.

Still, “The Conjuring 2” fea-

tures scares enhanced by James 
Wan’s remarkable sense of horror 
filmmaking. Wan utilizes the ten-
sion and release method of horror 
filmmaking to his full advantage, 
letting scenes breathe. He doesn’t 
force moments of horror where 
they don’t belong, instead letting 
scenes breathe. There’s also no gra-
tuitous blood and gore that makes 
other horror movies so tough to 
watch. Instead, he relies on tried-
and-true jump scares. These ele-
ments make the moments where 
he chooses to scare you that much 
more powerful. He also puts an 
eerie look on the film, with a dark 
filter applied over pretty much 
every shot, especially when they’re 
inside the house being haunted. 
“The Conjuring 2” is a master class 
in how horror filmmaking can, and 
should, be done.

And yet, despite the same quality 

of scary moments, “The Conjuring 
2” ’s story didn’t play quite as well as 
the first iteration. The ghosts were 
more present on-screen than in the 
predecessor causing a subtle loss in 
the tension, but saying it’s slightly 
worse than an impressive movie 
isn’t meant to be a huge criticism. 
Thanks to Wan, the sequel still had 
many of the elements that made the 
first film so spine-chilling, and in 
this case, that’s just enough.

search for a serial rapist in Ann 
Arbor. He said no improper police 
conduct occurred then either.

“(The shooting) was tragic for 

Ms. Rosser, the officer involved, as 
well as all who care about either of 
them,” Baird wrote. “It was tragic 
for the community as a whole. 
However, it was a completely jus-
tified and reasonable response to 
the situation the officers encoun-
tered that day.”

Baird also refuted assertions by 

the HRC report that AAPD lacks 
transparency in handling com-
plaints against officers. In 2014, 
38 complaints were brought by 
citizens against AAPD officers, 
with 10 being sustained follow-
ing investigation. In 2015, 30 such 
complaints were made and four 
sustained.

Baird noted he has personally 

initiated complaints against his 
own officers based on anonymous 
information on social media.

“I have personally initiated 

complaints 
against 
unknown 

employees for information posted 
on social media sites,” he wrote. 
“The Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment has routinely demonstrated 
that they have earned … trust.”

While supporting the recom-

mendation of an independent 
auditor for his department, Baird 
argued there is insufficient evi-
dence to support the other provi-
sions of the HRC report, and he 
suggested a premature implemen-
tation would undermine his offi-
cers. However, he remained open 
to reconsidering his position fol-
lowing the review results.

“Because 
the 
commission’s 

report blends the national discus-
sion with the Rosser incident, I 
have concern that there may be 
an appetite to address national 
issues and concerns with local 
policy,” Baird wrote. “To presume 
that the Ann Arbor Police Depart-
ment’s practices are not ‘positive’ 
and that a review board is the best 
way to ‘ensure future adherence’ 
absent any supporting reference is 
ill advised.”

Stambaugh also agreed with 

Baird that AAPD has consistently 
performed 
professionally, 
but 

she argued this does not make 
increased civilian oversight unrea-
sonable.

Stambaugh noted that numer-

ous cities similar to Ann Arbor — 
including Austin, Texas — already 
have civilian oversight boards in 
place that are similar to the one 
recommended by the HRC.

“(Baird) 
simply 
thinks 
his 

police department is very good, 
and it is very good comparatively, 
but the police should not be polic-
ing themselves,” Stambaugh said. 
“We didn’t say the police depart-
ment is awful. We said this would 
improve overall community-police 
trust.”

City councilmember Graydon 

Krapohl (D–Ward 4), who also 
served on the HRC, said the term 
“oversight” can be misconstrued 
as critical of the police department 
when the actual goal is to foster 
better communication between 
the police and community.

“Oversight is a difficult word 

to use,” he said. “We’re looking to 
form a possible group to create bet-
ter community and police interac-
tion to ensure we eliminate those 
gaps that exist in understanding 
both ends of the spectrum.”

Krapohl believes a consensus 

that would be agreeable to both 
Baird and the community can be 
found, saying Baird is still fun-
damentally in favor of improving 
community relations.

“I think (Baird) doesn’t like the 

(oversight committee) idea, but 
he’s not — from my conversations 
with him — opposed to a more 
interactive committee or group 
that again shares information and 
looks to how to create a better 
understanding between the police 
committee and the community 
they serve,” Krapohl said.

However, some residents have 

been skeptical of the HRC’s efforts 
since 2015, arguing the recom-
mendations will not impose suf-
ficient transparency on AAPD. 
Some also expressed worry that 
the proposed oversight board will 
be turned into a rubber-stamp 
body once council formalizes its 
powers to appease the AAPD and 
its police officer union.

Shirley Beckley, an Ann Arbor 

resident of the past 74 years, said 
the public’s ability to ask ques-
tions and give input at public 
forums regarding police reform 
was severely limited in 2015, and 
she is ultimately pessimistic as to 
whether meaningful change will 
pass. Beckley added she is also 
skeptical of Mayor Christopher 
Taylor’s commitment to meaning-
ful reform, noting all HRC mem-
bers are appointed by the mayor.

“You don’t have a forum to talk 

about police brutality … and not 
allow your community to freely 
talk,” Beckley said, pointing to 
questions at forums that had to 
be written in advance and chosen 
by moderators. “We can piss and 
moan all we want, but I don’t think 
we’re going to get anywhere.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

“We must continue to stand 

against violence and stand together 
as members of communities, as allies 
and as people affected directly or 
indirectly by this senseless act of vio-
lence,” she wrote. “We are, of course, 
all affected by this tragedy, often in 
different ways. We know that many 
members of our own community 
share the multiple identities with 
those directly impacted by these 
events, and it can make things par-
ticularly difficult for us to learn, to 
study and to care for others.”

An unidentified group of students 

chalked the Diag in rainbow colors 
with the words “Michigan stands 
with Orlando” and “In memory of 
our friends in Orlando” Sunday after 
news of the shooting broke.

In an interview with the Daily, 

Will Sherry, director of the Spec-
trum Center, said they will be host-
ing an open center for students 
Monday and Tuesday for those who 
wish for community in this time of 
tragedy.

“We are a space that seeks to 

create a safe environment where 
LGBTQ students can thrive, he said. 
“We are having our space open for 

people to come and reflect.”

Jeffery Noble and Danny Clergy, 

two University of Michigan alumni 
who were relighting vigil candles 
set up next to the chalking, said they 
had also attended a vigil at Aut Bar. 
The vigil featured speakers from 
several community members, Jim 
Toy, founder of the Spectrum Cen-
ter and Jim Toy Community Center 
and Ann Arbor Mayor Christopher 
Taylor; State Rep. Adam Zemke 
(D- Ann Arbor) was also in atten-
dence. 

In his remarks Taylor empha-

sized the need to use this act of 
violence as a pathway towards 
fighting extremism and hatred in 
a broader sense. 

“What do we do with this?” 

he asked. “We live our lives 
with a renewed commitment 
to speak out against and defeat 
the notion that a gun-riddled 
America is a safer America; to 
speak out against and defeat vio-
lent extremism; and to speak out 
against and defeat rank bigotry in 
all its forms.”

Sherry said the Spectrum Cen-

ter had a presence at the vigil in 
order to pay their respects and 
offer support.

“We were there to be with one 

another and reflect on the sad-

ness of lives lost and to give our 
condolences to the families of the 
victims,” Sherry said.

Noble said he feels the need to 

raise awareness of the need for soci-
etal acceptance and tolerance so that 
it can be a starting point for change.

“I feel that this is the most we 

can do,” he said. “I mean, we want 
to do more, but the only way we 
can help is through publicity and 
getting the word out so that this is 
a cause of change in society.”

The 
shooting 
has 
sparked 

renewed discussions of gun safety 
and hate crimes against members 
of the LGBTQ community.

In his speech, Obama called for 

solidarity with the LGBTQ com-
munity.

“This is an especially heart-

breaking day for all our friends 
— our fellow Americans — who 
are lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans-
gender,” Obama said. “The place 
where they were attacked is more 

than a nightclub — it is a place 
of solidarity and empowerment 
where people have come together 
to raise awareness, to speak their 
minds and to advocate for their 
civil rights. So this is a sober-
ing reminder that attacks on any 
American — regardless of race, 
ethnicity, religion or sexual ori-
entation — is an attack on all of us 
and on the fundamental values of 
equality and dignity that define us 
as a country.”

mentioned the Ann Arbor’s com-
munity’s impressive ability to 
come together and show support 
in such a short notice.

“In the wake of such tragedy, 

it is heartening to know that we 
have the ability to come together 
as a community,” Schlissel said. 
“We are artists and activists, 
leaders and students, faculty, staff 
and community members.”

Schlissel 
finally 
noted 
the 

importance of upholding values in 
the aftermath of violence.

“We must remember that our 

differences are precious,” Schlis-
sel said. “That those of all reli-
gions, ethnicities, beliefs, sexual 
orientations and gender identities 
make us a complete community,”

Mayor Taylor offered advice 

on how to interpret Sunday’s vio-
lence, as well as how to move for-
ward.

“It is our first instinct to view 

these killings as a senseless 
slaughter, and in one respect this 
surely is true,” he said. “The risk 
is in attributing too much cultural 
meaning to the actions of a soli-
tary killer, for this amplifies and 
gives power to the despicable.”

Taylor took a distinctly pointed 

tone, condemning and calling for 
action on what he viewed as a lack 
of gun control, and also called for 
acceptance of the Muslim com-
munity. Taylor received two sepa-
rate standing ovations from the 
crowd, though some members of 
the audience shook their heads in 
disagreement when Taylor con-
demned the role of guns in Ameri-
can society.

“I believe that what we can do is 

that we can live our lives. We can 
live our lives with a renewed com-
mitment to speak out against and 
defeat the notion that a gun-rid-
dled America is a safer America,” 
Taylor said, as he was interrupted 
by spontaenous applause. “We 
must have a renewed commitment 
to live our lives with openness, 
pride and joy, to defend and affirm 
the full membership of our Mus-
lim brothers and sisters in our 
communities large and small”.

Jim Toy, described by Taylor as 

an LGBTQ icon and community 
legend, concluded the speeches. 
Toy asked audience members 
to hold hands with one another 
and speak words of equality and 
peace.

Following 
the 
introductory 

speeches, the performance of 

Mozart’s 
Requiemcommenced, 

performed by students and faculty 
from the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance, as well as local musi-
cians. The ensemble, composed 
of 50 instrumentalists and 135 
singers, was assembled with just 
48 hours’ notice. The piece was 
conducted by Kevin Fitzgerald, a 
University alum who received his 
master’s degree in orchestral con-
ducting in 2015.

In his speech, Taylor comment-

ed that the piece was fitting for 
the occasion.

“It is a very appropriate work. 

Mozart’s Requiem is famously 
unfinished, much like the lives of 
those lost in Orlando,” he said.

The performance was con-

cluded with a moment of silence 
to respect the lives recently lost. 
This was followed by a series of 
prayers and words of faith given 
by community members. The 
group of prayer leaders included 
observers of Christianity, Juda-
ism and Islam.

Before the doors to the perfor-

mance opened, a small group of 
gun control activists bore signs in 
front of the auditorium. A group 
of five volunteers held orange 
signs that read “Moms Against 
Guns.”

The demonstrators came from 

a grassroots volunteer branch of 
the national organization Every-
town for Gun Safety. Rosalie 
Wright, the leader of the group, 
talked about how they are try-
ing to spread the word about gun 
safety and bring people together 
to create a unified front.

“If enough people engage in an 

organized way, then something 
can happen legislatively, in terms 
of law, awareness, gun safety for 
children,” Wright said. “We are 
going at it on all fronts.”

The group was asking people 

to sign a petition in support of 
increased gun control legislation 
upon entering Hill Auditorium. 
According to Wright, they had 
“pages and pages” of signatures.

Music, Theatre & Dance sopho-

more Bailey McMillian said she 
found the performance and over-
all event to be beautiful. She said 
the outcome of such an incredible 
event put on in such a short notice 
represents the Ann Arbor and 
University communities.

“The fact that we showed up 

here at 7:35 p.m. and there was 
a huge crowd already waiting to 
get in was incredible,” McMil-
lian said. “This is what I wanted 
U-M to be, this is what I thought 

it would be and what Ann Arbor 
would be and this is exactly what 
it is.”

Don Lyons, a recent LSA gradu-

ate, had a similar reaction to the 
event. He particularly appre-
ciated 
the

expressed during the introduc-
tory speeches and the concluding 
period of prayer.

“I thought it was a really beau-

tiful performance,” he said. “I 
thought that it was especially 
great to have so many voices, 
difference voices of faith. It was 
great to hear voices that came 
from people of faith and those 
who are secular.”

Jeff Ellison, one of the choir 

singers and a member of Universi-
ty Musical Society Choral Union, 
said he and the members of the 
organization were contacted by 
e-mail and asked if they would be 
willing to volunteer their voices 
to the show. He said the crowd 
that showed up was incredible.

“It was heartwarming to see 

such a nice group turn out, and 
to feel the energy in the room 
was just fantastic,” Ellison said. 
“This was a time of mourning and 
everybody came with that idea, 
but everybody also came with the 
idea that love is the way forward.”

Steinberg resigns as 
men’s tennis coach 

By ETHAN WOLFE

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Just two years after getting 

hired as the Michigan men’s 
tennis coach, Adam Steinberg 
resigned 
Wednesday 
to become the 
new head coach 
at 
Arizona 

State.

“We 

appreciate 
everything 
Adam and his 
family 
did 

for 
Michigan 

and the men’s 
tennis program 
over the last 
two 
seasons,” 

said Michigan 
Athletic 
Director Warde Manuel in a 
statement. “We wish him well 
in the future.”

The 
announcement 
came 

after a 21-8 season, in which 
the Wolverines advanced to 
the second round of the NCAA 
Regionals.

After a 7-17 finish in his first 

year at the helm of the program 
during 
the 
2014-15 
season, 

Steinberg’s 
team-oriented 

coaching style took only one 
season to come to fruition with 

a dramatic 14-win turnaround.

Before 
arriving 
in 
Ann 

Arbor, Steinberg had coached at 
Pepperdine for 10 years, where 
he won a national championship 
in 2006 behind a 36-2 overall 

record — the 
most victories 
by an NCAA 
championship 
team. 
Later, 

Steinberg 
took 
over 

for 
former 

Michigan 
men’s 
tennis 

coach 
Bruce 

Berque, 
who left the 
program 
in 

2014 after his 
team 
failed 

to 
make 
it 

past 
the 

second round of the NCAA 
Tournament.

When Steinberg spoke to The 

Daily in early April, he discussed 
his broad, yet effective goal 
to change “everything this 
program is about.” In just two 
seasons, Steinberg’s ideology 
had already left its mark.

Despite 
Steinberg’s 

departure, 
Michigan 
will 

return a bevy of its starters as it 
begins its search for a new head 
coach.

In just two 

seasons, 

Steinberg’s 
ideology had 
already left its 

mark.

Daily Sports Writer

For the third time in the last 

four years, the Michigan softball 
team reached the Women’s College 
World Series. Though the Wolver-
ines did not win a championship, 
Michigan has much to be proud 
of in an expectations-filled sea-
son. Senior second baseman Sierra 
Romero cemented herself as the 
greatest hitter in Wolverine histo-
ry — perhaps one of the top players 
of all time — junior right-hander 
Megan Betsa earned Big Ten pitch-
er of the year and Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins set the record for 
most NCAA wins by a head coach.

The Daily looks at the high-

lights, gives out awards and recaps 
the other top moments of the 2016 
softball season.

Most Valuable Player: Sierra 

Romero

Through her first three seasons, 

Romero was the Wolverines’ best 
player. In 2016, she demonstrated 
that she could be one of the best 
players ever in the history of the 
softball. Romero hit at least .450 
for the third straight year, includ-
ing .500 in conference play. She 
hit 19 home runs in 59 games and 
had 79 runs batted-in. Romero 
notched her fourth straight NFCA 
All-America honors and her third 
consecutive year as a member of 
the first team. During Michigan’s 
time at the WCWS, USA softball 
named her the 2016 National Col-
legiate Player of the Year. This past 
Thursday, Romero became the first 
recipient of the NFCA D1 Player of 
the Year award.

In her four years, she played 

both second base and shortstop 
and started all but one game. She 
ranks first in the Michigan record 
book in career batting average, 
runs, home runs, RBI and slugging 
percentage. Romero will continue 
her softball career as a member of 
the USSSA Pride, which will play 
a series at Alumni Field from June 
27-29.

Breakout player: Tera Blanco
Recruited as a pitcher, Blanco 

has spent most of her two seasons 
in Ann Arbor in the right side of the 
infield at first base. The sophomore 
improved on a solid freshman year, 
hitting .404 with 12 home runs and 
66 RBI — an improvement of .113, 
five and 19 respectively. She also 
slugged .748, second-best on the 
team.

Blanco earned her first NFCA 

All-America first team honors and 
was named to the All-Big Ten sec-
ond team. Blanco moved up to the 
No. 5 spot in the batting order and 
may hit cleanup next season. The 
first baseman had a total of 318 
fielding opportunities notching 
296 putouts — best on the team — 
and finished the season with a per-
fect fielding percentage of 1.000.

With Michigan’s two best offen-

sive threats graduating, Blanco 
will be looked to for dynamic and 
powerful hitting next season.

She also could see extended time 

in the circle with the departure 
of fifth-year senior right-hander 
Sara Driesenga. In a combined 37 
innings in her two years, she sports 
a 2.08 earned-run average and 22 
strikeouts.

Game of the year: Super 

Regional Game: Michigan 5, 
Missouri 4

Hutchins described her Wol-

verines’ come-from-behind, late-
game win over Missouri as “one 
of the very greatest victories ever 
in the history of Michigan soft-
ball.” Coming from a coach in her 
32nd year in Ann Arbor, it clearly 
has significance. All season long, 
Michigan was expected to advance 
to the WCWS, and it did so in an 
unbelievable fashion.

Down 4-1 heading into the sev-

enth inning, the Wolverines scored 
four runs to defeat the Tigers and 
travel to Oklahoma City for their 
third time in four years. Michigan 
had just four hits in its first six 
innings. In the seventh, it had five. 
The Wolverines loaded the bases 
for Romero — the NCAA career 
leader in grand slams — who hit 
a fly ball to center field, scoring 
pinch runner Mary Sbonek from 
third base. It was now 4-2. The 
Wolverines had a problem though: 
they were down to their last out.

Kelly Christner wasn’t affected. 

She swung at Tigers’ right-hander 
Paige Lowary’s next pitch and 
lined it down the right-field line to 
add another run. Senior outfielder 
Kelsey Susalla doubled home Sier-
ra Lawrence, and the game was 
tied at four.

Michigan again was down to 

its last out with Missouri’s 9-1-2 
hitters due up in the bottom of 
the inning. Lowary’s 1-2 pitch to 
Blanco sailed to the backstop and 
Christner came sprinting from 
third and touching home for the 
go-ahead run. Betsa would stop the 
Tigers’ bats in the bottom of the 7th 
for one final time en route to a sec-

ond consecutive WCWS berth.

Moment of the year: Honor-

ing Hutchins at Alumni Field

In Bloomington on April 2, 

Hutchins became the winningest 
coach in NCAA softball history 
with her 1,458th victory. Her Wol-
verines run-ruled Indiana, 8-0, 
that Saturday afternoon.

About two weeks later on April 

15, a sold-out crowd at Alumin 
Field watched Michigan athletic 
director Warde Manuel honor 
Hutchins with a ceremony after 
the Wolverines’ victory over rival 
Ohio State. As Hutchins stood in 
the dugout, Manuel offered praise 
for a coach who has won more 
games than anyone else in Michi-
gan’s history.

“She’s mad at us. She doesn’t 

want any of this attention,” Manuel 
said that night. “Thirty-three years 
of coaching. I hope it is the halfway 
point in her career.”

A video tribute played on the 

scoreboard in left field. In the mon-
tage, numerous Michigan coaches 
expressed their amazement with 
Hutchins’ achievements. Hockey 
coach Red Berenson, field hockey 
coach Marcia Pankratz, men’s 
basketball coach John Beilein and 
baseball coach Erik Bakich were 
among those who shared stories 
and praise for the winningest 
coach in softball history.

Hutchins thanked her coaching 

staff and the numerous fans who 
showed their support, beginning 
her address by sharing her adora-
tion with Alumni Field. 

“This isn’t about me. It’s about 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan,” 

Hutchins said that night. “Any win 
we ever get in softball is for the 
University of Michigan. I am hon-
ored and humbled to be up here 
today.”

Romero perhaps best summa-

rized the sentiments of the players 
after the game.

“She 
deserves 
everything,” 

Romero said. “I know she doesn’t 
like the attention. But, she’s the all-
time winningest coach.

“She’s a great leader for our pro-

gram, and she’s made me not only 
a better player but a better person 
and has prepared me for every-
thing after college. She’s an amaz-
ing woman.”

In a season filled with come-

back wins, long home runs and 
numerous shutouts, it was the hon-
oring of a long-time coach, now the 
winningest in NCAA softball, that 
stood out the most. 

‘M’ Softball: Season in Review

Adam Steinberg compiled a 28-25 record in his two seasons at Michigan.


Ferlic wins championship in 
3,000-meter steeplechase

By MIKE PERSAK

Daily Sports Writer

Mason 
Ferlic 
landed 
awk-

wardly in the final water pit of the 
3,000-meter steeplechase at the 
NCAA Outdoor Championships in 
Eugene, Ore., on Friday. All of his 
momentum had been lost, and the 
fifth-year senior distance runner 
knew that he would have to get it 
back quickly in order to keep his 
lead and win the national champi-
onship.

At least he thought that’s what 

was necessary.

“At that point the legs were very, 

very heavy,” Ferlic said. “I didn’t 
move as quickly as I wanted to the 
line, and I know that I had about 
ten seconds on the next guy coming 
into the bell lap, but I was thinking 
‘Oh, come on. Just get to the line 
before somebody comes around 
me.’ ”

Despite the stumble, Ferlic fin-

ished the race 3.51 seconds ahead 
of the second-place finisher to win 
just the second national champi-
onship for Michigan in the 3,000-
meter steeplechase — 33 years after 
the Wolverines’ first title in 1983.

Though the race ended in a way 

that, according to Ferlic, made him 
nervous, the hardest part of the day 
was before he even stepped on the 
track.

“The worst part is the eight hours 

in the hotel room leading up to the 
race,” Ferlic said. “With an evening 
race, you eat your breakfast, and it 
is just you and your thoughts that 
whole time. I just tried to distract 
myself by doing something else 
while sitting around.

“I did some crossword puzzles, 

watched a little bit of ‘Alaskan Bush 
People’ and read a little bit. I just 
(did) some things to keep my mind 
off of the race.”

But once it came to running 

the actual race, Ferlic had almost 
no trouble, opening up a big lead 
before he had even finished his sec-
ond lap.

Ferlic’s success wasn’t necessar-

ily a surprise, as he entered the race 
ranked No. 1 in the country in the 
event. What did surprise Ferlic and 
his coaches, though, was the lack of 
a push from the rest of his competi-
tors.

“I was a little bit surprised that 

nobody went with the early move 
that he made,” said Michigan assis-
tant coach Kevin Sullivan. “But he 
was running at a level above a lot 
of guys, and that’s just his natural 
ability. So it didn’t surprise me that 
he built up a lead, it just surprised 
me that nobody challenged ini-
tially.”

And the challenge never came. 

Though the slight mishap at the 
end of the race may have cost Ferlic 
in margin of victory, his time of 

8:27.16 was a new personal record, 
besting his old mark by 1.61 sec-
onds.

Ferlic’s time was also below the 

Olympic standard of 8:30 for the 
event. Though it isn’t his first time 
running below that mark, he is the 
only collegiate athlete to run under 
8:30 in the 3,000-meter steeple-
chase.

But in the end, Ferlic mostly 

focused on winning the national 
championship, a feat that he has 
been working toward for five years 
at Michigan.

“I remember that feeling viv-

idly,” Ferlic said. “Stepping on the 
line, I said, ‘Hell yeah. I just won 
the national championship in front 
of 10,000 people.’ ”

Added Sullivan: “He puts his 

mark on the board as another 
national champion. There’s a lot of 
great history in our program, and a 
lot of fantastic national champions. 
But now, Mason gets to add himself 
to that list.”

Ferlic’s season isn’t done by any 

means. He will now train for his 
return trip to Eugene in the first 
week of July for the Olympic Trials.

But Ferlic can enter that train-

ing process with great confidence 
now knowing that, even with a bit 
of a stumble, he ran his best time at 
the end of the season to reach his 
ultimate goal: becoming a national 
champion.

Romero, Ferlic named 
Athletes of the Year

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Wednesday, the Michigan Ath-

letic Department named Mason 
Ferlic and Sierra Romero the 2015-
16 Athletes of the Year.

For Romero, this marks the sec-

ond consecutive year she has been 
named the Female Athlete of the 
Year.

The senior second baseman 

recently finished her storied col-
lege career, during which she broke 
numerous school and national 
records while also leading her team 
to three appearances in the Wom-
en’s College World Series — includ-
ing a runner-up finish in 2015.

In her final season in Ann Arbor, 

Romero became the first player in 
NCAA history to tally 300 runs, 
300 hits and 300 RBI, while posting 
a .451 batting average with 19 home 
runs and 79 RBI.

For her efforts, she was named 

to the NFCA All-American team for 
the fourth time in her career, while 
also winning the ASA Softball Play-
er of the Year award after finishing 
as a top-three finalist in each of the 
previous two years.

Ferlic is coming off a weekend in 

which he won the NCAA Champi-
onship in the 3,000-meter steeple-
chase, marking the culmination of 
a brilliant senior year that also saw 
him post a U.S. Olympic Trials qual-
ifying time in the steeplechase.

Ferlic, also a senior, finished his 

career at Michigan as both a five-
time 
USTFCCCA 
All-American 

and Big Ten champion in track, as 
well as a two-time USTFCCCA All-
American in cross country. He was 
a two-year captain of both teams, 
and helped lead the cross country 
team to its first Big Ten title in 18 
years.

Women’s track and field places 20th 

at NCAA Outdoor Championships

By MATTHEW KENNEDY

Daily Sports Writer

Competing at its final meet of 

the season, the Michigan women’s 
track and field team had four 
athletes earn All-American honors 
on its way to a top-20 finish. 
Despite the strong performance, 
though, not all of the races went as 
well as planned.

Five Wolverines competed at 

Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore., 
in three different events, with the 
first events taking place Thursday.

While four of the Michigan 

runners had preliminary races 
that day, sophomore Gina Sereno 
competed in the lone race of the 
10,0000-meter run. Due to its 
length, the event does not have a 
preliminary run, and the only run 
is for the championship.

With little room for error, 

Sereno ran a career-best time 
of 33:35.16 to capture 13th place 
— good enough for All-America 
honors. Sereno’s time was almost 
exactly a minute behind the 
championship performance.

After an uneventful day Friday 

for the Wolverines, three runners 
returned to the track for final 
races Saturday.

Fifth-year 
senior 
Shannon 

Osika and redshirt sophomore 
Jaimie Phelan both qualified for 
the 1,500-meter run Saturday, 
making two of three Michigan 
runners qualify for the finals after 
fifth-year senior Devon Hoppe 
narrowly missed out on advancing.

The event was arguably the 

Wolverines’ best on the day, with 
Osika taking fourth place and five 
points with a time of 4:12.23, just 
three seconds behind the victor. 
Phelan also earned one point for 
the team with her eighth-place 
finish of 4:15.61.

“It was an awesome experience,” 

Osika said. “It was my first race at 
Hayward Field and it was a very 
high energy facility. There were a 
lot of fans and it was even better 
getting to experience it with my 
two teammates Devon and Jaimie. 
To be able to run the prelim with 
Devon and the final with Jaimie 
was a really cool experience.”

The most anticipated event 

of the weekend for Michigan 
featured one of the Wolverines’ 
most-decorated runners of all-
time: senior Cindy Ofili.

Ofili 
won 
the 
60-meter 

hurdles at the NCAA Indoor 
Championships in March, and 
currently holds the seventh-fastest 
time in the world in the event for 
2016. After narrowly winning the 
100-meter hurdles at the Big Ten 
Championships last month, Ofili 
seemed to be the odds-on-favorite 
to take home the 100-meter 
hurdles crown.

With an incredibly strong wind 

of +3.8 behind Ofili — well above 
the +2.0 threshold for records to 
count — Ofili managed to get out to 
an early lead. But she was moving 
too fast and could not keep up the 
pace, ultimately dropping all the 
way down to fourth with a time 
of 12.81 seconds. The finish still 
provided the team with five points, 

but after such a stellar regular 
season, losing the final race by 
0.27 seconds was not how most 
envisioned the race going.

“That was the biggest positive 

wind that she’s had in her life, 
and she wasn’t quite sure how to 
handle that,” said Michigan coach 
James Henry. “She probably had 
the best race of her life, and all of 
that accumulating, it seemed to 
her that the hurdles were getting 
to her too soon and they were 
too close and she just could not 
navigate it.”

Still, the year was a memorable 

one for the team. Michigan took 
home both the Big Ten Indoor 
Championship 
and 
Big 
Ten 

Outdoor Championship, and even 
came in second in the Big Ten 
Cross Country Championship. A 
sixth-place at the NCAA Indoor 
Championship followed by this 
weekend’s 
results 
marks 
the 

first time since 2009 that the 
Wolverines have finished in the 
top 20 of both championships.

“In the end, we always want 

to be in a position to win,” Henry 
said. “But to come out as a winner 
it made me very happy that the 
girls listened and that they worked 
hard, and I’m just so thankful for 
the senior class to go out the way 
it did because these kids that are 
graduating have been some of the 
best students and some of the best 
athletes. More importantly, they 
have been some of the best people 
that have come to the University 
of Michigan, and I am so happy to 
have coached them.”

Michigan earns best 

NCAA finish since 1997

By MIKE PERSAK

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s track 

and field team had finished in 
the top 15 at the NCAA Outdoor 
Championships only once in the 
last 55 seasons. That changed 
last week.

The 
Wolverines 
sent 
six 

athletes to Eugene, Ore., who 
combined to score 15 points — 
a count good enough to pull 
Michigan into a tie for 13th place 
overall.

The highlight of the meet for 

the Wolverines came from fifth-
year senior distance runner 
Mason Ferlic in the 3,000-meter 
steeplechase. Ferlic entered the 
meet ranked No. 1 nationally in 
the event, and backed up that 
ranking convincingly. Heading 
into the final lap of the race, the 
fifth-year senior had opened 
up a lead so large that even a 
stumble when landing in the 
final water pit didn’t thwart 
his chances of finishing first. 
Ferlic still won the race easily, 
finishing 3.51 seconds ahead of 
the second-place runner.

“He’s been so focused his 

entire career here at Michigan,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Jerry 

Clayton. “But he’s been so 
dominant in that event every 
time he’s raced this year. He’s 
pretty much (gone) out, taken 
control of the race from the 
beginning, and that led to him 
hitting the qualifying standard 
for the Olympic Trials, and 
then he carried that right on 
through the (Big Ten Outdoor 
Championships), 
the 
(NCAA 

Preliminary Rounds) and even 
in the qualifying rounds.

“It’s just a credit to him, and 

what an outstanding way to 
finish his career as a Wolverine.”

Freshman 
sprinter 
Taylor 

McLaughlin also became an All-
American this weekend in the 
400-meter hurdles by finishing 
fifth in the event with a time of 
49.74 seconds, only .01 seconds 
away from his personal record.

McLaughlin 
finished 
first 

among all freshmen competing 
in the 400-meter hurdles, and 
with all of the success that he 
has had in his rookie season, 
the future looks bright for the 

freshman.

“I don’t like to put predictions 

or limits on people,” Clayton 
said. “I think he can be as good 
as he wants to be. The talent is 
there. If he stays focused … we 
just feel really confident (in 
McLaughlin). I don’t anticipate 
any problems from what I’ve 
seen. He’s just a great person, 
and that’s the bottom line.”

Ferlic 
and 
McLaughlin 

weren’t the only All-Americans 
for Michigan. Senior Steven 
Bastien finished eighth in the 
decathlon, the lowest finish 
possible to still qualify for All-
American 
honors. 
Bastien’s 

status as an All-American was 
in doubt right up until the last 
event of the decathlon: the 
1,500-meter run.

Bastien entered the race in 

ninth place, but finished the 
race with a personal record time 
of 4:29.82. The time was good 
enough to put Bastien in eighth 
place, just five points ahead of 
Georgia’s Devon Williams.

The 13th place finish for the 

Wolverines is their best since 
1997, and it comes in just the 
third year under Clayton, who 
was also surprised of the success 
early in his tenure at Michigan.

“When I looked at the job 

when I was interviewed, I felt, 
with the tradition Michigan 
had, there was no reason why 
we couldn’t be better than they 
were,” Clayton said. “After I was 
here a year, I thought, ‘Well this 
is going to take a little bit longer.’ 
I thought we were looking at five 
or six years. But obviously the 
athletes have responded.”

Michigan will now look to 

take the momentum from the 
NCAA Outdoor Championships 
into the offseason in multiple 
facets. The coaches will continue 
recruiting and some of the 
athletes themselves will prepare 
to compete in the Olympic Trials 
in July.

Though the 13th-place finish 

was the best in recent history, 
the Wolverines have a lot to look 
forward to. Because with young 
guys like McLaughlin returning 
and the successes of the program 
as a whole, Michigan will have 
plenty of experience to lean on 
as it heads into next season.
