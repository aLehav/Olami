A Haven Hall classroom was 

overflowed with University of 
Michigan students listening to a 
series of speakers who discussed 
the 
Deferred 
Action 
for 

Childhood Arrivals program, 
which may come under threat 
because of executive actions by 
President Donald Trump. 

DACA, an executive action 

— signed in 2012 by former 
President Barack Obama in 
response to a gridlock on 
immigration 
policy 
on 
the 

part of Congress — protects 
undocumented students from 
deportation and allows them to 
obtain work permits. However, 
it does not provide a path to 
citizenship.

Trump 
has 
repeatedly 

advocated stricter immigration 
laws, deporting undocumented 
workers and building a wall 
along the southern border with 
Mexico. On Saturday, University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

reaffirmed 
the 
University’s 

commitment to international 
students 
by 
reiterating 
its 

policy against releasing the 
immigration status of students. 
The announcement followed 
Trump’s signing of an executive 
action 
barring 
immigration 

from several majority-Muslim 
countries.

The first speaker, Karma 

Chavez, a professor at the 
University 
of 
Texas-Austin, 

said she believes immigration 

is currently one of the most 
prominent issues today.

“I am very excited to be here 

for this occasion,” she said. “I 
don’t think there is anything 
more crucial we can be talking 
about in this moment. And 
I have shifted what I have 
planned to focus on a bit 
because the last two weeks have 
been rather intense.”

Citing 
the 
political 

turbulence of the last three 

weeks, she focused on sanctuary 
cities, which have become a 
rallying point for many amid 
anti-immigrant rhetoric and 
actions from the White House. 
In recent months, the Central 
Student Government has been 
working toward making the 
University a sanctuary campus.

Chavez argues institutional 

sanctuary is more of a fallacy 
than anything else, and while 
universities and cities can help 

facilitate grassroots movements 
in 
favor 
of 
undocumented 

people, their connections to 
institutions will keep them 
inherently suspicious in their 
eyes. 

She 
also 
noted 
that, 

while schools are obviously 
protected spaces, actions like 
the outlawing of gun bans on 
campuses in Texas, to the fact 
that schools do not have the 

Gretchen 
Whitmer, 
former 

Democratic minority leader in the 
Michigan state Senate and lecturer 
at the Ford School of Public 
Policy, addressed the University 
of Michigan’s chapter of College 
Democrats Thursday night about 
her 
candidacy 
for 
Michigan 

governor in 2018.

Whitmer 
officially 
filed 

paperwork 
for 
the 
upcoming 

gubernatorial race in January, 
becoming the first candidate to 
officially enter.

Previously, 
Whitmer 
served 

in 
the 
Michigan 
House 
of 

Representatives from 2001 to 2006, 
the Michigan Senate from 2006 
to 2014 and most recently served 
as the Ingham County prosecutor 
until her term expired on Dec. 31, 
2016.

Whitmer cited the Flint Water 

Crisis as one of the chief reasons 
why she decided to run for governor 
in 2018, saying if elected, she will 
strive to ensure that a government 
failure of that proportion will never 
happen again.

Office hours were held in 

the hallways of Haven Hall 
on Thursday as the Graduate 
Employees’ 
Organization 
— 

the labor union representing 
graduate student instructors and 
graduate student staff assistants 
employed by the University of 
Michigan — held a “grade-in” 
to promote awareness of the 
contract-bargaining process they 
have been undertaking with the 
University since November and 
to increase visibility of graduate 
student labor.

About 100 GSIs and GSSAs 

crowded the ledges and the floor 
along the hall from 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. for the grade-in, in an effort to 
make the work graduate students 
do for undergraduate students 
and the University visible.

Some of the GEO’s proposals, 

intended to improve diversity, 
equity, inclusion and accessibility 
for graduate student employees, 
were declined or not satisfactorily 
met by the University’s most 

recent offer.

“We hope that this (grade-in) 

indicates to the University that 
we’re paying attention and that 
we expect more,” said Rackham 
student Denise Bailey, a member 
of the GEO.

“The University, in our opinion, 

can afford to support us more 
than they do,” Bailey added, citing 
that 23 percent of undergraduate 
contact with faculty is with GSIs, 
but 1 percent of the University’s 
budget is reserved for graduate 
student staff, a statistic included 
in the GEO’s press releases. 

When reached for comment, 

University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen wrote in an email, 
“Negotiations are underway, so 
it would be premature to get into 
specifics. We believe we will reach 
a successful resolution.”

Among the proposals that 

GEO representatives say have not 
been met by the University is the 
creation of paid staff positions 
for graduate students working 
on diversity programs as part of

Michigan ACLU Deputy Director Rana Elmir discusses the Executive Order on immigrants and refugees and its potential impact on UM Students at Angell Hall on 
Thursday.

Recent 
executive 
actions 

by President Donald Trump’s 
administration 
prompted 
an 

“Executive 
Order 
Teach-In” 

event featuring Rana Elmir, 
the deputy director of the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
of Michigan. At the talk Elmir 
discussed the rights of citizens, 
green-card holders and visa 
holders in light of an executive 
order signed last Friday.

The University of Michigan 

Muslim 
Graduate 
Student 

Association 
and 
Arab 
and 

Muslim 
American 
Studies 

Department hosted the event, 
which filled a classroom in 
Angell Hall and two overflow 
rooms.

Elmir 
examined 
the 

executive 
order 
signed 
on 

Jan. 27, titled “Protesting the 
Nation from Foreign Terrorist 
Entry into the United States,” 
which 
most 
notably 
blocks 

entry 
of 
immigrants 
and 

nonimmigrants 
from 
Iraq, 

Iran, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and 
Somalia for 90 days — with the 
possibility of renewal — and 
Syria indefinitely.

The executive order also 

suspends 
the 
U.S. 
Refugee 

Admissions 
Program, 
which 

works to find and resettle 
immigrants 
in 
the 
United 

States, for 120 days.

Elmir said she believes this 

executive order is specifically 
a 
Muslim 
ban, 
which 
is 

demonstrated by the specifics 
of the executive order.

“Anti-Muslim discrimination 

has been a part of American 
history for as long as Muslims 
have been in this country,” 
Elmir said. “And you move 
forward and put in policies and 
practices that show that you 
devalue this community. Well 
that’s what you have now, with 
this Muslim ban.”

LSA senior Tamanna Ahad, 

a Muslim affected personally 
by the executive order, hopes 
the event can help nurture 
conversation and knowledge 
regarding immigration.

With Valentine’s Day fast 

approaching, Cupid has shot 

his arrow into the heart of Ann 

Arbor. According to a recent 

Amazon list, Ann Arbor was 

ranked the 10th most-romantic 

city in the United States.

Topping the list are San 

Antonio, Texas, Miami, Fla. and 

Alexandria, Va. 

According to the press 

release by Amazon, the 

rankings were determined by 

compiling “sales data from 

cities with more than 100,000 

residents on a per capita basis 

and includes purchases of 

romance novels and relationship 

books (both Kindle and print); 

romantic comedy movies (DVDs 

and digital).”

Other factors that were 

considered were music 

purchases from artists like 

Adele and John Legend, as well 

as “the sales of sexual wellness 

products.”

Thanks to data collected 

by Amazon’s 

“Alexa,” our 

insights into 

the love lives 

of those who 

live in the 

United States’ 

midsized and 

large cities 

has expanded. 

According 

to Amazon’s 

website, 

the most-

requested 

love songs 

on “Alexa” 

included 

“Thinking 

Out Loud” by 

Ed Sheeran 

and “I Will

You” by 

Whitney Houston. Customers

“Pantry 
dropping 
good” 

boasts the motto of Dozen’s 
Cookies, a gourmet cookie 
company founded by University 
of Michigan alumni Ethan and 
Jared Forman, who attended 
the Ross School of Business 
and are twin brothers. The duo 
is committed to selling high-
quality cookies at an affordable 
price for students.

According to Jared Forman, 

the 
brothers 
had 
enough 

credits to finish their degrees 
last fall, so they decided to 
operate for profit on campus. 
The brothers bake and deliver 
orders from their home in Ann 
Arbor, focusing on e-commerce 
sales 
until 
they 
graduate 

and move back home to Los 
Angeles, where they wish to 

open a brick-and-mortar shop. 

“Now, having a large amount 

of time, we can professionally 
operate 
our 
business 
and 

ultimately create a sense of 
reliability that our customers 
need,” Jared Forman said. “It’s 
just been a good opportunity. 
We now have the ability to fully 
dedicate our time to opening a 
brick-and-mortar shop back in 
Los Angeles, but at the same 
time to start to grow and build 
a brand specifically through 
e-commerce.”

After 
creating 
the 
idea 

in high school, the business 
developed as a charitable club 
named Cookies 4 Care at the 
University in 2013.

“We were able to manifest 

that business in the form of 
a club,” Jared Forman said. 
“And that club became Cookies 
4 Care, which was one of the 
largest active clubs at the 

University of Michigan in my 
freshman year.”

After an order is placed 

online, 
Jared 
Forman 
said 

they normally have the cookies 
baked and delivered locally in 
less than one hour. The cookies 
have a shelf life of one to two 
weeks when kept in their 
cellophane wrapping.

“Essentially we are working 

on distributing a high-quality 
product and a very affordable 
price,” he said. “The greatest 
thing about baked products, 
in terms of margins, (is that) 
there 
can 
be 
a 
mutually 

beneficial 
relationship 
for 

both parties. We feel more 
comfortable distributing for a 
cheaper price.”

Business 
senior 
Allison 

Diener 
has 
ordered 
from 

the service twice and said 
the 
responsiveness 
and 

price point were favorable, 

especially compared to local 
competition.

“The cookies are very 

gourmet 
and 
extremely 

affordable, 
especially 

compared 
to 
Insomnia 

(Cookies)” 
Diener 
said. 

“They will come deliver 
them to you or meet you 
wherever you want.” 

Jared Forman said he is 

trying to make his company 
as personable as possible. As 
head of marketing, he wishes 
to create a platform that 
customers find both easy 
and fun to use. Jared said he 
takes pride in his company 
and making deliveries to his 
customers.

“The attitude I’m hoping 

to personify through our 
cookie account is something 
that’s 
very 
fun 
and 

something 
very 
playful,” 

Jared Forman said. “Maybe 
get a laugh in their day or a 
smile. We truly are building 
a brand from scratch. I

“I come from a community 

that’s 
a 
large 
immigrant 

population with a large Yemeni 
population,” Ahad said. “It’s 
really important to get to know 
more about this and get a 
dialogue about the things that 
are happening.”

Elmir 
discussed 
the 

vagueness of the executive 
order and how it was clarified in 
the following days by the Trump 
administration 
and 
several 

lawsuits. It was unclear how 
green-card holders, visa holders 
and 
legal 
and 
permanent 

residents would be affected.

“As of yesterday, they put 

out a memo clarifying the 
legal, 
permanent 
resident 

issue,” Elmir said. “And what it 
says here is that the executive 
order does not apply to legal, 
permanent residents, does not 
apply to green card holders.”

Elmir spoke to U.S. Customs 

and Border Protection, the 
government agency responsible 
for 
carrying 
out 
Trump’s 

executive order, about how it 
exercises its role in airports. 
CBP often takes travelers to 
secondary inspection for further 
examination to determine their 
eligibility to enter the country.

“Their job is to determine 

whether non-U.S. citizens and 
legal permanent residents have 
the authority, the right, to enter 
the country,” Elmir said. “CBP 
does not have the authority 
to take you to the secondary 
inspection 
based 
on 
your 

religion, your race, your national 
origin, your gender, ethnicity or 
political beliefs.”

The speakers also offered 

advice 
to 
people 
directly 

affected by the executive 
order, and with what legal 
status someone should or 
shouldn’t 
travel. 
Elmir 

highlighted 
a 
person’s 

rights while in secondary 

inspection, focusing on their 
rights when CBP asks to 
inspect their computers and 
cell phones.

“Whether 
you 
have 

the right to decline your 
technology to a CBP officer 
after they’ve asked for it … 
it’s a contested legal issue,” 
Elmir said. “Some courts 
have said they have this right, 
some courts have said they 
don’t have this right.”

Public Health student Sami 

Shalabi is both directly and 
indirectly affected by the 
ban.

“I think it’s important for 

us to know our rights, see 
how we can help each other 

out,” Shalabi said. “See when 
we’re at the airport or when 
someone’s in crisis, what are 
different options that we 
have.”

Elmir 
concluded 
by 

answering 
questions 
and 

addressing 
concerns 
from 

the 
audience, 
including 

discussing 
specific 
cases 

of what somebody with a 
student visa should do and 
what actions people should 
take.

“Our work should be to 

dismantle this ban, not to add 
more countries,” Elmir said. 
“Criminalizing Saudi people 
by 
suggesting 
that 
they 

should be on this travel ban is 
incredibly counterproductive 
and counterintuitive to our 
movement to dismantle the 
ban as a whole.”

GREEN CARD
From Page 1

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
in 

October of last year. The plan 
established 
programs 
across 

several 
departments, 
which 

include research, event planning 
and designing course materials. 
There is currently no paid staffing 
attached to these programs.

“Usually the people who are 

doing diversity work are people 
of color,” said Rackham student 
Sara 
Chadwick, 
co-chair 
of 

communications for the GEO. 
“So the purpose of asking the 
University to create some paid 
positions for that kind of diversity 
labor is to ensure that that labor 
doesn’t unfairly fall onto the 
shoulders of people of color, who 
are not getting paid for it.”

Rackham 
student 
Rachel 

Miller added not having these 
positions means the burden of 
implementing the University’s 
initiative is disproportionately 
falling on the people it is meant to 
serve.

Many graduate student staff 

were 
also 
concerned 
about 

protections 
for 
international 

students. According to GEO 
President John Ware, a Rackham 
student, more than 30 percent of 
GSIs are international.

“Most of those people have 

visas that prohibit them from 
working more than 20 hours 
a week, but under our current 
contract, their supervisors can 
require them to work more than 
20 hours a week,” Ware said. “We 
proposed a change to the work 
hours rules that would protect 
people from being required to 
violate their visas.”

Ware argued the University 

has offered insufficient solutions 
or outright declined to take on 
the problems that the GEO’s 
proposals aim to solve. In the 
case of international students, 
Ware said the University declined 
to change the work hours rules 
and proposed a change in the 
language of offer letters instead.

Rackham 
student 
Drew 

Johnson 
emphasized 
the 

importance of this proposal.

“One 
thing 
that’s 
really 

important to me, especially at 
this political moment, is that we 
look out for graduate employees 
who are international students,” 
Johnson said. “And that we 

make sure that they’re receiving 
whatever protections we can put 
in place for them.”

Improved 
protections 
for 

international students have been 
demanded of the University at 
large following executive orders 
made 
by 
President 
Donald 

Trump, and committees and 
initiatives have been formed to 
work to that end.

Other important issues for 

graduate 
students 
impacted 

by the bargaining process are 
affordability and accessibility.

“We really need (a pay 

increase) that would bring 
us up to a living wage in Ann 
Arbor, which we really need 
if graduate education is going 
to be accessible to people 
without family wealth to rely 
on, people who may have debt 
from undergrad,” Ware said, 
adding the University’s offer 
of pay increases over the next 
three years was not sufficient. 
Contracts 
are 
renegotiated 

every three years.

The cost of living in Ann 

Arbor is higher than in the 
majority of other cities in 
Michigan, and the housing 
market for students is highly 
competitive.

“A lot of the time (the work 

GSIs do) becomes kind of 
invisible for undergrads and 
for the day to day life at the 
University,” 
Johnson 
said. 

“We want to make sure people 
can see the work that GSIs do 
and how committed we are to 
making Michigan a great place 
to be a graduate student and 
a great place to be a student, 
period.”

Rackham 
student 
Mary 

Hennessy also advocated for the 
grade-in to spread awareness 
about the work of the GEO. 

“We’re a democratically run 

organization, and this is a way 
for us to show our commitment 
to diversity, equity, inclusion 
and democracy on a local level 
— where we work and learn,” 
Hennessy said during the event.

She 
added 
this 
was 

especially important given the 
environment created by the 
Trump administration, which 
seems to be undermining these 
principles. 
This 
statement 

elicited nods and snaps from 
the circle of graduate students 
seated on the floor with her, 
laptops and books surrounding 
them.

same protections as, for example, 
churches.

Chavez finished the speech by 

noting the connections between 
the queer movement of the early 
2000s and the protests of the 
undocumented population now, 
and the need for fundamental 
grassroots 
protests 
going 

forward.

Following 
Chavez, 
Silvia 

Pedraza, a professor of sociology 
and American culture at the 
University, discussed the origins 
of DACA and why it has become 
such 
a 
point 
of 
contention 

for people on all sides of the 
immigration debate.

According to Pedraza, there 

seems to be a paradox between 
accepting the system is broken 
and a lack of activity on the part of 

Congress. In this vacuum, Obama 
signed 
the 
DACA 
executive 

action, aimed at providing legal 
protection from deportation to 
students currently residing in the 
United States.

“I think that had we ever 

managed to couple the DREAM Act 
— which as I have said has had lots of 
support — with a sort of ‘get tough’ 
provision, it would have increased 
the chances of the DREAM Act 
passing, because it always failed by 
just a few votes,” Pedraza said.

Despite the benefits of the order, 

Pedraza also emphasized how it 
lacked what she considered to be 
the two fundamental aspects that 
all good immigration reform have: 
a humanitarian aspect, which helps 
those currently undocumented, and 
a “get tough” component, which 
helps close an existing loophole or 
problem with immigration.

She concluded by remarking that, 

despite the current political climate, 
the increase in participation and 

organization among the Latino 
community boded well for the 
long-term future of undocumented 
workers.

“I think that what we have been 

seeing is that the protests have 
grown larger than ever, and that 
participation within them has 
widened so that now there is not 
just Latinos participating in these 
protests,” she said. “And I think 
that, ironically, given the rejection 
that Latinos have been the brunt 
of in recent years, more than ever 
Latinos have come to understand 
the political process in this country, 
and in so doing have become 
American.”

Engineering senior Dulce Rios 

spoke on her first-hand experience 
as an undocumented student, and 
what the recent changes at the 
University meant to her.

In high school, she said, her 

undocumented status prevented 
her from receiving a scholarship, 
despite being among the top 

students in her class, and prevented 
her from receiving financial aid, 
which left her unable to pay for 
classes at community college.

Even with all these difficulties, 

she said she has had a series of lucky 
breaks that have helped her achieve, 
including a friend who generously 
worked to help her pay for her 
first term as a full-time student 
and a connection to a fellowship at 
the University, which eventually 
led to her being able to attend the 
University.

She 
talked 
about 
how 

appreciative she was of the 
University for giving her a 
platform to speak on these issues. 
To 
her, 
the 
sometimes-slow 

response of the administration 
is an indication of the University 
wanting to help students like her, 
but dealing with the blowback of 
opponents. 

“Right now, helping people 

is a little more important,” she 
said.

top,” Whitmer said. “To see such a 
spectacular failure of government 
hurt so many people and still not be 
fixed … it’s been 1,000 days since the 
people in one of our cities have been 
able to turn on their taps with any 
assurance (of clean water).”

Whitmer also stressed the need 

for the future leadership of the 
Democratic Party to understand 
people who voted for President 
Donald Trump and to work to pull 
voters back into the party.

“We cannot demonize Trump 

voters, and that’s a hard thing to 
tell people who are passionate 
Democrats,” Whitmer said. “But we 
can’t win if we don’t start pulling 
people back into the party that 
really is focused on helping people 
throughout our state.”

Additionally, 
Whitmer 

emphasized Democrats should not 
assume large voter turnout and 
traditionally blue voters, such as 
union members, will always persist.

“You can’t take anything for 

granted,” she said. “You can’t 
assume that (the) Democratic Party 
is a machine that will naturally 
turn out 45 percent of the vote,” 
Whitmer said. “We can’t assume 
that everyone in the city of Detroit 
is going to vote Democrat, we can’t 
assume that if you have the (United 
Auto Workers’) endorsement it 
means every one of their members 
is going to vote for you.”

Whitmer said she is embarking 

on a 21-month campaign and 
emphasized she will focus on 
visiting college campuses in the 
state to address the concerns of the 
younger generation.

“I’m going to make sure that at 

the campuses — all the campuses — 
I’m stopping and engaging students 
at that level,” Whitmer said. “If 
we had left the election up to the 
millennial generation, it would 
have been a totally different result, 
so I think there’s a lot we can learn 
about young minds.”

Whitmer also fielded policy 

questions and spoke about the future 
of health care in Michigan, saying 
she hopes the Healthy Michigan 
Medicaid Plan, which receives 
funding from former President 
Barack Obama’s Affordable Care 
Act, will continue to provide care for 
Michigan residents. However, she is 
unsure about its future, given the 
current focus of the U.S. Congress 
on repealing “Obamacare.” She also 
claimed she was influential in Gov. 
Rick Snyder’s support of the plan in 
2014.

“It’s my hope that the Healthy 

Michigan Plan is intact by the 
time this election comes around,” 
Whitmer said. “I worked very 
hard to expand Medicaid through 
‘Obamacare.’ I have been a chief 
critic of Governor Snyder, but 
there were a couple of things we 
worked on together that he could’ve 
accomplished without me and my 
caucus — and that’s one of them.”

Snyder also said he anticipates 

forthcoming changes to health care 
in his State of the State address last 
month and would like to see Healthy 
Michigan serve as a modelpolicy for 
the rest of the country.

“There’s going to be changes 

in health care,” he said. “The 
important thing is we need to let 
them know that Healthy Michigan 
is a model that can work for the rest 
of the country. We look forward 
to reimagining health care for 
all Michiganders and our entire 
country with Michigan being a 
leader in that dialogue.” 

LSA junior Collin Kelly, chair 

of College Democrats, said he 
believes Whitmer is a strong 
candidate with experience and 
was honored she chose the 
University’s College Democrats 
chapter as the first college 
campus visit in her campaign.

“It’s nice to see a vision 

for Michigan that is hopeful, 
that things can look up in the 
future,” Kelly said. “This will 
give her almost two years to 
make sure people in the state 
have a voice through her — 
that’s awesome. We’re excited 
and happy she made the time to 
come out here.”

WHITMER

Americans at the University of 
Michigan, there’s a real problem 
there.”

Jones said the differences 

between 
admitting 
students 

based on merit, excellence or 
diversity must be examined when 
discussing a diverse campus.

“Merit 
has 
been 
largely 

challenged 
and 
discredited 

as the way forward,” she said. 
“Excellence is alive and well 
here and I think there’s a tension 
between excellence and diversity 
that I think we can talk a lot 
about … To recognize, in the third 
century, the ways in which our 
commitment and our definitions 
of excellence hamper how we 
construct our objectives and our 
purpose of diversity.”

In his opening statements, 

Terrence 
McDonald, 
history 

professor 
and 
chair 
of 
the 

President’s Advisory Committee 
on University History, thought 
back on the history of the 
University and its past forms 
of 
discrimination 
toward 

minorities, 
including 
forced 

segregation and the many years 
before women and minorities 
could attend the University. He 
also addressed the University’s 

ban on race- and gender-based 
affirmative action in college 
admissions and how we respond 
to this history in terms of 
diversity.

“We have two legacies from 

the past of the University,” he 
said. “One is the revolutionary 
commitment to equal access and 
equality. The other is a practical 
history of obstacles … Our history 
is both one of privilege and pain 
and one of understanding and, on 
that basis, change can happen. 
We can move forward.”

Addressing 
Sotomayor’s 

denouncement of the low number 
of African Americans on campus, 
Associate English Prof. Ruby 
Tapia said 5 percent is too low 
compared to the 14.2 percent 
of Michigan residents who are 
African 
American. 
However, 

she noted the University has 
programs in place that are 
working to increase this statistic.

“The 
University 

administration has been clear 
about its commitment to remedy 
the 
significant 
challenges 
in 

regards 
to 
diversity, 
equity 

and inclusion,” she said. “Our 
participation in the American 
Count Initiative, … the HAIL 
Scholarship, Wolverine Pathways 
and the rigorously researched 
Poverty Solutions program are 
all testimonies to an important 
institutional 
commitment 
to 

equity and inclusion.”

Tapia went on to denounce 

President Donald Trump’s recent 
executive orders and appointments, 
including the travel ban from 
multiple predominately Muslim 
countries, the order to complete 
the Dakota Access Pipeline and the 
nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch 
to the Supreme Court. Both Tapia 
and Jones diverged from their 
syllabi this week in response to 
the president’s recent orders and 
actions.

“All of these things, and many, 

many more, are producing concern, 
demoralization and fear of our 
nation,” Tapia said. “They are 
clearly producing consequential 
resistance as well.”

She went on to cite the many 

protests on campus and across 
the nation in response to the 
president’s executive orders.

After the statements from the 

panelists, LSA junior Stephen 
Mitchell asked the professors about 
their opinions on the student riots 
on the University of California-
Berkeley campus Wednesday night. 
The protests broke out when right-
wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos 
was scheduled to speak on campus. 
Students started fires and threw 
objects at university buildings as an 
act of protesting the speech.

Trump tweeted a threat of 

rescinding federal funding to UC 
Berkeley on the grounds that not 

allowing Yiannopoulos to speak 
because of his opposing views was 
a violation of free speech.

Jones said the words from 

the justices on Monday can 
shed some light on how we 
interpret the law in terms of the 
difference between hate speech 
and exercising your guaranteed 
freedom of speech.

“I 
heard 
two 
things 
on 

Monday,” she said. “On one 
hand, yes, law has an answer to 
the speech that was proposed at 
Berkeley. I heard something else 
on Monday from Justice Baer 
which was her imploring us to 
understand that the Constitution 
is our Constitution and not … 
a fixed text. It is a text to be 
interpreted, to be struggled over 
and to be transformed.”

After 
the 
panel, 
Mitchell 

said the discussion helped the 
students contemplate both the 
colloquium and who is part of the 
University community.

“I think one thing that was 

nice to see was we’re talking 
about 
diversity 
and 
getting 

to hear and unpacking of the 
experience of Monday’s talk with 
Justices Sotomayor and Baer and 
getting to hear these different 
perspectives,” he said. “(The 
panelists) are all members of our 
community too and I think that’s 
something, as students, that we 
forget.”

Though 
Ethan 
Forman 

began as head baker for the 
business, the brothers now 
split their time baking and 
delivering. Ethan also works 
on 
website 
development 

and 
customer 
relation 

management, 
helping 
to 

drive every order that gets 
processed. Jared said being 
brothers 
has 
only 
been 

beneficial to business.

“The great thing about 

working 
with 
your 
twin 

brother is that you pretty 
much know each other for 
the past 22 years,” Jared 
Forman said. “So in terms 
of controversy or conflict, 
that’s limited.” 

The 
biggest 
challenge 

they face is capturing the 
support of the brand with 
unfamiliar customers, said 
Jared Forman.

“Our 
retention 
rate 

for 
customers 
has 
been 

extremely positive,” Jared 
Forman said. “But much like 
starting a new business, the 
largest feat can literally be 
getting them into your door 
or, in our case, placing an 
order.”

Jared Forman said Dozen’s 

is open to taking cookie flavor 
requests from students, and 
their most popular cookies 
have been the red velvet, 
white chocolate chip and 
chocolate chip.

“We specifically focus on 

cookies,” Jared Forman said. 
“Whatever you think, we can 
bake. We do have a variety 
of recipes. We’re ultimately 
there for our customers. We 
want our customers to give 
us their opinion. In the five 
years that we’ve been baking 
and perfecting this recipe, 
it truly is like a science. In 

terms of how we got this 
recipe, it was just through 
years of trial and error from 
customer feedback.”

Engineering senior Aaron 

Berro said he has been 
eating the cookies for three 
years. In addition to the 
fast service, Berro said the 
price plays a big role in his 
consistent business.

“They literally sell a dozen 

cookies for six dollars,” Berro 
said. “Also, every time I’ve 
ordered the cookies are ready 
pretty much instantly.”

Business senior Adam Weiss 

said, though not many people 
know about Dozen’s yet, he 
likes that they make their 
cookies from scratch and offer 
a lot of variety.

“As someone with a sweet 

tooth, it is usually not too 
hard to please me,” Weiss said. 
“But with that being said, it’s 
been hard to find a fresh, local 
cookie that isn’t some premade 
mix.”

Jared Forman said Dozen’s 

sells cookies at Scorekeepers 
Bar and Grille on Tuesdays, 
Thursdays and Saturdays, and 
will also have pop-up shops on 
campus during the semester, 
donating all their proceeds 
to the C.S. Mott Children’s 
Hospital. 

“It’s always great to see 

Dozen’s Cookies being sold at 
Skeeps,” Berro added.

Once back in California, 

the brothers hope to open a 
traditional brick-and-mortar 
shop in Los Angeles. Until 
then, though, Jared Forman 
said they are excited to keep 
serving students this semester.

“The best part is actually 

doing it,” Jared Forman said. 
“I think one of the most 
fulfilling things for both of 
us is just constantly having 
that support and having the 
time and the resources to do 
something with 100 percent 
integrity to the best of your 
capabilities and to see those 
results.”

I

t’s 2017 and, according to 
White House counselor 
Kellyanne 
Conway, 
it’s 

finally the dawn of 
a new day. Wanna 
know why? 

The 
American 

reality 
is 
finally 

getting a facelift. You 
may not think there’s 
anything 
wrong 

with, oh, you know, 
actual 
reality, 
but 

that’s only because 
the 
mainstream 

media indoctrinated 
you into liking it. And 
trust me, this current reality 
really 
pales 
in 
comparison 

with Chief Strategist Steven 
Bannon’s — er, I mean President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
— 
new 

American reality. Believe me, 
it’s gonna be “yuge.” 

Imagine 
a 
world 
where 

pigs fly, border walls are cost-
free 
and 
hair 
plug 
comb-

overs are deeply attractive. 
Thanks to alternative facts, 
the 
new 
administration’s 

recent innovation in political 
communication, you don’t have 
to imagine anymore!

And really, if you think 

about it, we as college students 
are well-poised to capitalize 
on 
this 
new 
impressive 

innovation. Say goodbye to 
days spent poring over library 
books, 
LexisNexis 
search 

results and statistical analysis 
software. 
With 
alternative 

facts, these little annoyances 
can become things of the past 
… well, at least in the social and 
natural sciences.

Disclaimer: 
Unfortunately, 

engineers aren’t quite off the 
hook. We still need them to 
use actual knowledge to design 
things for American workers 
to manufacture. In Trump’s 
America, that is very important. 
(Unless they want to design 
parts for folks in the growing 
clean 
energy 
industries 
to 

manufacture. That’s a waste of 
time, because climate change 
isn’t real.)

Now I know a lot of you have 

been pretty stressed lately by one 
or more of the many executive 
orders 
Trump 
has 
signed 

since his inauguration. (Hey, 
remember when Republicans 
frowned on the extensive use of 
executive orders?)

Granted, reality in Trump’s 

America hasn’t been all that great.

One 
of 
Trump’s 
first 

executive 
orders 
banned 

individuals from seven Muslim-
majority 
countries 
(notably 

not the ones that the majority 
of 9/11 terrorists came from. 
Those 
countries 
have 
the 

desirable 
feature 

of being home to 
several 
Trump 

Organization 
properties) 
from 

entering the United 
States. 
The 
ban 

even 
excluded 

translators 
and 

others who risked 
their lives to assist 
the 
Department 

of 
Defense. 

Apparently, “Support 

Our Troops” actually means 
“Support Our Troops*.”

(*But don’t expect the United 

States to compensate you for 
your service, because they may 
renege on their promises if and 
when it becomes politically 
expedient to do so.)

The executive order even 

had implications for students 
at the University of Michigan. 
One student on campus, LSA 
senior Tina Al-khersan, told of 
her sister’s detainment at the 
Canadian border while U.S. 
officials struggled to interpret 
and implement the notoriously 
vague executive order. Her 
sister is a citizen of the United 
States, New Zealand and Iraq.

You 
could 
follow 
the 

news 
surrounding 
this 

injustice, 
angering 
yourself 

in the process. But this might 
tempt you to exercise your 
First 
Amendment 
right 
to 

#resist and join one of the 
many protests set to become 
permanent features of Trump’s 
presidency 
or 
otherwise 

behave in ways Tomi Lahren 
might deride as liberal crybaby 
whining. Now, some people 
might say you’d be doing your 
civic duty to engage in the 
democratic process by making 
your voice heard and holding 
the president accountable.

If all that sounds like it may 

pose too big a risk of worry 
lines, grey hair or peptic ulcers, 
then boy, are you going to 
appreciate 
alternative 
facts. 

Alternative facts will ensure 
that you, the voter, will have 
absolutely nothing to worry 
about under President Trump 
(that you know of).

With 
alternative 
facts, 

Trump’s 
highly 
unjust, 

un-American ban on some of 
the people most in need of a new 
start to life in the United States 
becomes a humane, necessary 
and wholly Constitutional way 
of keeping Americans safe and 

putting Americans first. It’s 
the only way to protect good, 
hardworking American families 
from malicious terrorists who 
wish to do them harm. This is 
supported by the alternative 
fact that 99.8 percent of all 
acts of terrorism and crime are 
perpetrated by Syrian terrorists 
disguised as refugee children.

Obviously, this article has 

been more or less satirical so far. 
But let’s get real for a second.

The right to free speech —which 

includes the rights of journalists 
to report information on our 
political leaders and their actions 
and disseminate to the public — 
is one of the most fundamental 
American rights, and it’s a crucial 
feature of our democracy.

But for the first time in 

my 
memory, 
the 
president 

and the officials within his 
administration have publicly 
lambasted honest, hardworking 
reporters for simply doing their 
jobs and reporting on his actions 
as president-elect and president. 
On Wednesday, Trump even 
used a Black History Month 
event as a platform to condemn 
CNN as “fake news” and praise 
conservative-leaning 
network 

Fox 
News. 
The 
president 

has 
also 
publically 
agreed 

with 
Bannon’s 
statement 

characterizing the media as the 
“opposition party.”

It doesn’t matter who is in 

the White House, Republican 
or Democrat. Transparency and 
democratic oversight require 
ardent free speech protection 
and journalists who can do their 
job of relaying important, if 
inconvenient, facts to the public 
without the White House trying 
to delegitimize entire networks 
perceived as unfriendly. 

My real suggestion? Support 

journalists 
who 
do 
the 

difficult — and increasingly 
dangerous — work of holding 
our leaders accountable. If you 
can, subscribe to reputable 
news sources and follow their 
content in your free time. If 
nothing else, do your own 
research before buying into 
Trump & Company’s fiery 
claims that reputable news 
networks 
are 
“fake 
news” 

whenever 
they 
publish 
an 

unflattering story.

But hey, if none of that sounds 

appealing, you could always 
believe the information that 
the administration wants you to 
have: its alternative facts.

I 
 

think we can all agree that 
the world is currently in 
the midst of a great deal 

of upheaval. There 
are few times when 
it does not seem 
as 
if 
the 
world 

is 
changing, 
of 

course 
(we 
can 

maybe 
assume 

there 
wasn’t 
too 

much societal shift 
in 
the 
pre-multi-

cellular 
organism 

stage of the Earth 
for 
instance). 

Still, the intensity of societal 
change that took place while 
humanity figured out crop 
rotation agricultural systems 
compared with the amount of 
societal change in the last ten 
years (or ten days even) is not 
even close.

It can be challenging during this 

time of transition and uncertainty 
to feel safe, think clearly or keep 
up with political changes. To 
help, I sometimes try to rely on 
the things that don’t change, the 
things that make me feel safer: 
humanity’s penchant for helping.

There’s a quote from Mr. 

Rogers I’ve seen quite a bit 
recently that’s fairly in line 
with this thinking. It states, 
“When I was a boy and I would 
see scary things in the news, my 
mother would say to me, ‘Look 
for the helpers. You will always 
find people who are helping.’”

To illustrate this, while 

working and traveling abroad 
this summer, there were a 
handful of times when I didn’t 
feel completely comfortable. 
That just comes with the 
territory when your language 
skills are spotty and you 
constantly look like you’re 
wearing a hat that reads, 
“I’m very American and very 
gullible! Please confuse or rob 
me!” However, even when I 
was feeling nervous, I often 
found 
help 
from 
random 

people willing to step in.

One specific instance I can 

point to is when I used a week 

off work to visit Morocco. My 
travel partner and I had set 
up a tour of the palm groves 

on the outskirts of 
the city as a day 
trip. Unfortunately, 
we had some mixed 
messages with the 
tour guide and ended 
up in the wrong place 
with no quick way to 
contact him. I was 
left 
to 
frantically 

Google his contact 
information 
while 

taxi drivers came by 

repeatedly to ask us where we 
were going and if we needed a 
ride. This did not do wonders 
for my anxiety.

I was ready to give up or 

have a small panic attack on 
the street (both equally likely) 
when another man approached 
us to ask about giving us a 
taxi ride somewhere. I started 
waving him off, already telling 
him that we were just waiting 
on our ride when he asked for 
more details.

I 
was 
immediately 

distrustful, but when I gave 
a quick explanation of our 
situation, he waved over the 
other taxi drivers. He relayed 
the information about our issue, 
and they immediately started 
collaborating with me about 
how to figure this out together.

I was ridiculously touched 

and 
grateful. 
These 
men 

definitely had better things 
to do than help — including 
making a living — yet they were 
seriously involved in helping 
us, and we all celebrated when 
I got in touch with our guide.

In this instance, the stakes 

for not receiving help were 
relatively 
low. 
We 
would 

have missed our tour and I, 
incidentally, would not have 
experienced being thrown off a 
camel later that day. (Actually, 
maybe it would have been 
better if we didn’t receive help 
after all.) It would have been 
disappointing, but not harmful 
in a long-term or serious way.

I really can’t say the same for 

immigrants and other at-risk 
populations 
in 
the 
United 

States right now though.

There are serious, long-term 

repercussions on a personal and 
a societal level when families and 
individuals are being threatened 
with deportation, being barred 
from entry into the country or 
losing health care. Families are 
being indiscriminately kept from 
their homes and being denied 
access to doctors, which many 
would consider a human right.

With the scale of these issues, 

making a positive difference, even 
on an individual level, can seem 
too complicated to even attempt. 
To deal with these heightened 
challenges, people need legal help 
and financial security — things 
that many of us can’t offer.

With this in mind, it can be 

challenging to know how to 
be the helpers here. We have 
to work within our means, 
and sometimes when we can’t 
throw money at a problem to 
make them go away, donating 
time and attention might not 
feel like enough — it can be 
hard to see the payoff when it 
seems that nothing changes, 
especially 
when 
you’re 

challenging 
something 
on 

the institutional and societal 
level, like sexism or racism. 
It may not feel immediately 
rewarding, but that doesn’t 
make it any less valuable.

The payoff of these small 

actions 
is 
cumulative 
and 

can have a massive impact 
on the whole. Showing up to 
protest, finding contacts and 
resources to get involved with 
and reaching out to those who 
might need your help are all 
worthwhile, every time, even if 
you feel you have little to offer. 
Every bit counts, even if it’s as 
small as taking a break from 
your work to translate some 
contact information for some 
confused foreigners.

Opinion
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
4 — Friday, February 3, 2017

L

ast Friday, President 
Donald 
Trump 

issued 
an 
executive 

order inappropriately titled, 
“Protecting the Nation from 
Foreign Terrorist Entry into the 
United States.” Ostensibly, the 
goal was to limit immigration 
from countries that the Trump 
administration deemed high-
risk for terrorism in the United 
States. We, along with millions 
of 
other 
Americans 
and 

concerned people around the 
world, denounce the move as 
inhumane, devoid of empathy 
and simply un-American. By 
closing our doors to people 
from 
Iran, 
Iraq, 
Libya, 

Somalia, Sudan, Syria and 
Yemen — a group of nations 
that tens of millions of people 
call home — Trump is signing 
into law a message that is as 
misguided as it is powerful: 
The United States’ fear of 
terrorism is stronger than its 
commitment to humanity. In 
addition, by suspending the 
Refugee Admission Program, 
the Trump administration’s 
executive 
order 
is 
openly 

and brashly neglecting the 
humanitarian 
ideals 
that 

we as a nation should be 
striving toward. It is our 
unwavering stance that the 
United States should utilize 
its 
international 
privilege 

and influence by accepting 
the world’s most vulnerable 
citizens. By condoning the 
creation 
of 
physical 
and 

psychological borders, we are 
only distancing ourselves from 
the benefits that come with 

building 
an 
internationally 

diverse community. As long 
as Donald Trump and his 
administration 
continue 
to 

abandon these principles that 
we hold dear, we at Michigan 
in Color will continue to speak 
up and uplift the voices of 
those affected. Advocating for 
the safety of our fellow human 
beings is not, and cannot, be 
reduced to a bipartisan issue. 
Rather, it is an active choice 
that we should all be willing 
to embrace — regardless of 
political allegiance.

In 
response 
to 
this 

executive 
order, 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

issued a statement outlining 
their refusal to release the 
immigration 
status 
of 
its 

students and other community 
members. In the statement, 
the 
University 
reaffirmed 

its commitment to diversity, 
non-discrimination, 
privacy 

and public safety. Notably, the 
University’s refusal to disclose 
the 
immigration 
status 
of 

its students and community 
members does not violate any 
existing state or federal laws. 
While 
we 
are 
encouraged 

by the its commitment to 
protecting its students and 
faculty, we are unnerved that 
the 
University’s 
response 

was motivated by the desire 
to “identify, recruit, support 
and retain academic talent.” 
We reject the idea that an 
individual’s worth is solely 
determined by their ability 
to contribute to the academic 
community. 
We 
want 
to 

remind everyone that those 
affected by the ban are, first 
and foremost, human beings 

— individuals whose rights 
and civil liberties have been 
wrongfully denied.

While we wrecognize that 

many students have been and 
will continue to be affected 
by the legal unfoldings of the 
Trump 
administration, 
we 

acknowledge that those whose 
roots lie in the nations affected 
by the recent executive order 
may feel particularly isolated. 
Our 
platform 
has 
always 

existed as a space for students 
of color to affirm, acknowledge 
and express love toward one 
another, and this mission will 
only become more salient as 
we navigate the uncertainties 
of this new political climate. 
Writing, 
along 
with 
other 

forms of art, are particularly 
potent forms of healing and 
recognition of our existence, 
and we invite those who 
are affected to share their 
stories. Right now, we must 
exist together, because our 
livelihood as people of color 
relies on building solidarity 
with 
one 
another. 
Our 

liberation from oppression has 
always been connected. We 
must elevate one another and 
speak for those who cannot — 
the invisible, resilient people 
who have historically been left 
out of the dominant narrative. 
We must continue to articulate 
our experiences, issues, and 
suffering as people of color. 
There is power in speaking 
the unspeakable, and we will 
continue to amplify our voices 
and condemn those who try to 
silence us.

‘The Conformist’ and the 
merits of character study

1970s film’s pertinent subject matter tackles diverse topics 
from homosexuality to fascism, fashioning itself a timeless feature

Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The 

Conformist” seems to sneer 
at everything it celebrates. 
It 
mocks 
the 

excesses of the 
interbellum 
bourgeoisie yet 
revels 
in 
the 

beauty of 1930s 
Paris. It’s one of 
the most beautiful films ever 
made that takes one of the 
darkest times in history as 
its subject: Europe’s descent 
into fascism and World War 
II. It evokes this world with 
splendor, and, for the work 
of a Marxist, seems less 
concerned with details and 
conditions of history than its 
lost beauty. Its aesthetic and 
political ambitions wrestle. 
Ambiguity abounds.

An adaptation of Alberto 

Moravia’s 
novel, 
the 
film 

follows 
Marcello 
Clerici. 

He’s a middle-aged, upper-
class Italian man, a bit of 
an intellectual and an agent 
of the OVRA, the Italian 
version of the Gestapo. He’s 
on assignment by the Fascist 
secret police to travel to Paris 
and assassinate his former 
professor, Luca Quadri, an 
anti-fascist 
dissident 
who 

emigrated away from Benito 
Mussolini’s regime.

Marcello craves normalcy 

— whatever that is — and 
hopes to find security and 
stability in the banality of 
middle-class 
life. 
Indeed, 

to be normal seems the only 
desire he has — or at least the 
only one he’ll admit. So he 
marries the dullest bourgeois 
girl he can find and drags her 
off to Paris where he can kill 
two birds — his honeymoon 
and Quadri.

A 
series 
of 
memories, 

it’s told as Marcello and 
Manganiello follow the car 
of Quadri and his wife, Anna, 
with whom Marcello has an 

affair, in order to finish the 
job. Pre-Vichy Paris, not yet 
stained by collaboration, is 
the site of most of the action, 
and rather than a historical 
representation of the city, 
Bertolucci 
evokes 
a 
city 

inscribed 
with 
posterity’s 

imagination. 
Captured 
in 

rich, 
distorted 

chiaroscuros 
of red and blue, 
Bertolucci’s 
Paris 
is 
a 

dream and gives the film the 
expressionistic flare which 
has earned praise from many 
critics.

In 
Paris 
the 
object 
of 

Marcello’s desires appears to 
have been found. He walks 
down the Champs-Elysees, 
while his wife window-shops 
with Quadri’s wife, Anna, 
with whom Marcello has an 
affair. The quartet goes to 
dinner, and later dancing.

But no matter what he does, 

Marcello is not a normal man. 
With a syphilitic father in a 
madhouse and a morphine-
addicted 
mother, 
to 
be 

normal seems a reasonable 
desire. Moreover, when he 
was a school-boy, he was 
picked up by a chauffeur, 
Lino, who, promising to show 
him a pistol, takes Marcello 
to his apartment and makes 
sexual 
advances 
toward 

him, which are not initially 
rejected. Marcello grabs the 
pistol, 
shoots 
wildly 
and 

flees what he believes to be a 
murder scene. Tally up these 
aberrations from regular life 
and normalcy becomes an 
increasingly attractive home.

The film seems to offer 

Marcello’s 
repression 
of 

his homosexual desires as 
a neat explanation for his 
collaboration with the fascist 
state. Or, at the very least, 
fascism gives some form of 
absolution for whatever their 
sins — if not for the believers, 
then for those who abide by it. 
In an early scene, where this 
adolescent episode is first 

shown, Marcello reveals his 
attempted murder to a Roman 
priest during confession. But 
he finds little resolution in 
the clemency of the church. 
It’s the state, rather, that 
becomes a home for him, 
and it legitimizes him and 
overwhelms 
his 
moral 

reservations.

As he spends time with 

the 
Quadris, 
it 
becomes 

increasingly 
evident 
that 

Marcello might not be capable 
of killing them. Manganiello 
attempts 
to 
slap 
a 
little 

courage into him, but it’s 
ineffective. When they finally 
catch up to the couple, there’s 
an accident — a car runs into 
the Quadris. A group of fascist 
agents emerges from the other 
car, stabs and kills Quadri, 
while Anna runs to the car 
waiting a few meters away. 
As Marcello watches Anna 
scream for her life through 
his window, he refuses to look 
at her. The distance between 
the killers and Marcello slims. 
The lesson is clear: After 
fascism takes hold, there is 
no normal, and complicity 
doesn’t absolve.

But even then, when it 

seems resolved into a firm 
political position, the film 
retains its strangeness. The 
film hardly means whatever 
it claims — it’s too complex 
to 
merely 
equate 
sexual 

repression 
and 
political 

violence. If the film cannot 
reconcile 
the 
competition 

between art and politics, it 
does not needlessly sew them 
together.

In the final scenes of the 

film after Mussolini’s fall 
from power, Marcello sees 
Lino for the second time, 
now seducing another young 
man. 
He 
denounces 
him 

publicly as a homosexual and 
a fascist. After then publicly 
denouncing his friend Italo, a 
blind man and former Fascist 
broadcaster, Marcello gazes 
at the body of Lino’s would-
be partner. Ideology cannot 
corrupt everything.

Reflections on Philip Glass

We all agreed that it was 

probably the least interesting 
concert we had ever attended. 
Utterly lacking in variety and 
generally monochromatic, the 
cyclical nature of the music 
failed to capture our attention, 
the repetitive patterns seemed 
to lack even a flicker of the 
creative flame and there were 
more than a few 
moments which I 
personally 
found 

to 
be 
soporific 

in a literal sense. 
The best part was 
probably when we 
snapped 
a 
photo 

with 
that 
guy 

who 
looked 
like 

(but 
wasn’t) 
the 

Grateful 
Dead’s 

Bob Weir.

This took place 

around two years 
ago 
now, 
and 

the event in question was a 
performance by the composer 
Philip Glass and a violinist 
whose name I don’t remember. 
They played a handful of music 
by the first of the pair, as a sort 
of preview for an upcoming 
opera of Glass’s that was being 
staged at the same venue, UNC 
Greensboro. I and two of my 
close friends — a composer 
and a jazz guitarist/composer 
— attended on a whim, driving 
from where we studied half-
an-hour away in order to 
see a man who is perhaps 
the best-known composer of 
contemporary classical music 
in America. None of us really 
loved Glass’s music — at the 
time we were more enamored 
of people like Gesualdo, and 
might have also been prone to 
worship at the altar of Webern 
— but none of us expected to be 
as tremendously dissatisfied as 
we were.

In between pieces Glass 

spoke about his music into a 
microphone, mumbling almost 
indiscernibly. 
I 
distinctly 

recall something about him 
writing a piece “about 10 
years ago now, in 1990.” After 
the concert there was a table 
selling Glass’s recent memoir, 
“Words Without Music.” We 
walked past it.

All of which sounds rather 

harsh. And I suppose it is, 
but that’s how I felt at the 
time. In the years since, my 
tone has softened on Glass, 
but he remains a composer 
about whom I am supremely 
ambivalent. Over the past few 
days I’ve been thinking more 
deeply about him and his legacy 
— prompted in no small part by 
the pageantry surrounding his 
80th birthday this week — and 
it has had a clarifying effect. In 
short, I may not be enthused 
about his work, but I’m very 
comfortable with his removal 
from my “List of Composers I 

Hate” (a perdition to which J.P. 
Sousa is forever damned), and a 
bit disappointed in myself that 
it took so long.

Starting in the ‘60s, Glass 

— along with composers like 
Terry Riley, Steve Reich and La 
Monte Young — was among the 
first to develop a musical style 
which has come to be known 

as 
“minimalism,” 

music 
characterized 

by 
simple, 
slow-

changing 
and 

repetitive 
patterns. 

One 
of 
the 
only 

major 
movements 

of American origin 
within the classical 
music 
tradition, 
it 

appropriately 
draws 

from a variety of non-
classical 
influences: 

from 
contemporary 

American pop music 
it 
took 
its 
simple, 

consonant chord progressions, 
from Ravi Shankar and Indian 
classical music it took its 
concept of time, from west 
Africa it took some of its 
rhythmic inspiration.

Glass himself has undeniably 

had 
a 
profound 
musical 

influence, 
especially 
in 

America. Perhaps more than 
anyone else he embodied the 
trends of postmodern music 
in the ‘70s and ‘80s, and he 
crossed over into the public 
awareness like nobody else in 
his generation. He became a 
household name in the way that 
Stravinsky did a few generations 
earlier and no one has since. 
Many of the composers active 
today 
— 
both 
of 
younger 

and 
older 
generations 
— 

openly 
acknowledge 
their 

indebtedness 
to 
him 
(such 

as 
Nico 
Muhly, 
whom 
I 

interviewed 
in 
2015 
for 

this 
publication, 
or 
John 

Adams, with whom I spoke 
in 
September). 
I 
suppose 

even my own music has been 
touched by his hand — I wrote 
my first vaguely “minimalist” 
composition while in Paris last 
summer (studying as part of a 
program modelled after one of 
Glass’s own teachers, the great 
Nadia Boulanger), though its 
stylistic differences from Glass 
are significant.

But Glass’s reach isn’t limited 

to the classical music world. 
Over the last week popular 
figures from Paul Simon to 
Laurie Anderson, both of whom 
have collaborated with Glass, 
have been lauding him in the 
press. And in this I think can 
be seen one of Glass’s greatest 
strengths; he doesn’t confine 
himself to just his little corner 
of art. Throughout his career 
Glass has consistently engaged 
with other artists to create new 
works together. And this is true 
in areas outside of music — he 
has collaborated with the poet 

Allen Ginsberg on opera, with 
film director Martin Scorsese 
for his beautiful “Kundun,” 
with director Godfrey Reggio 
on “Koyaanisqatsi” and with 
countless others on any number 
of projects. And, at least to me, 
it’s when Glass is working in 
these dramatic media that he 
is at his strongest as a creator. 
Some 
of 
his 
instrumental 

music might make me feel 
like peeling my epidermis, but 
throw in a libretto and some 
choreography and the music is 
transformed into an engaging 
and 
meditative 
experience 

like no other (see: the opera 
“Einstein on the Beach”).

Part of Glass’s appeal can 

certainly be traced to these 
collaborations, but it also comes 
from the fact that his music 
proved to be a democratization 
of sorts. When he first came 
to prominence — and broad 
public popularity — he and the 
minimalist 
movement 
were 

seen as an alternative to the 
abstract and elitist approach 
of modernist composers like 
Elliott 
Carter 
and 
Milton 

Babbitt, who were generally 
locked away in offices on 
ivy-covered 
campuses 
with 

impressive names, inaccessible. 
But Glass — and Reich, and 
Riley — were easy to grasp on 
to, unpretentious and hip. And 
like much of the American 
avant-garde — musical, literary 
or otherwise — they dabbled in 
Buddhist and Zen philosophy, 
making them appealing to the 
New Age crowd which was 
rapidly forming.

My own first encounter with 

Glass’s music came sometime in 
middle school. I was spending 
my summer in the mountains 
of Colorado with my family, 
attending my first live concerts 
at the Breckenridge Music 
Festival and generally savoring 
existence. At a garage sale, 
my mother found a CD of his 
third symphony and “The Civil 
Wars Suite,” and immediately 
suggested we buy it. In a past 
life, Mom was herself one of 
these New Age types, and had 
come to love Glass when she 
lived in the Ginsberg-betrodden 
hippie town of Boulder, my 
birthplace. 
For 
her 
26th 

birthday she had even made 
the trip out to San Francisco 
to see his opera “Satyagraha,” 
a work in Sanskrit (who does 
that?) about the life of Gandhi. 
On our drive down from the 
mountains, we listened to the 
CD we had found, the evocative 
music perfectly accompanying 
the winding road and rugged 
landscape.

I hated it. Sorry, Mom. I 

hated it.

But check back with me in 

a few years — the way this is 
going, by then I’ll probably 
have canonized the man.

Kehlani’s debut a success

MUSIC REVIEW

Kehlani’s 
debut 
album 

SweetSexySavage 
contains 

exactly what the title might hint 
at, but it’s more 
than that. With 
17-tracks and no 
features, 
it’s 
a 

sprawling record, 
one 
that 
can 

easily hypnotize 
with luscious R&B rhythms 
and the singer’s effortless cool, 
leaving a listener lost among 
the pink clouds floating behind 
Kehlani. But be warned, it’s an 
inferior experience to move 
through SSS delicately. You 
won’t 
fully 
appreciate 
her 

perspective — she’s a young 
woman who knows what she 
wants, what she doesn’t and 
that both of those things are 
constantly changing.

Sonically, 
SweetSexySavage 

stands on its own with Kehlani’s 
singular style; moments across 
the record, however, recall a 
long list of artists who came 
before her: Beyonce, Rihanna, 
Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill, 
who’s 
prominently 
seen 

tattooed to Kehlani’s left arm 
on the album cover. And those 
are just a few.

SSS would as a whole benefit 

from some cutting, but there 
are more than enough moments 
of pop, R&B and hip-hop glory 

to 
forgive 
the 

occasional 
skip. 

The 
spoken 

introduction 
— 

one of the album’s 
highlights 
— 

opens with “My 

condolences to those who have 
lost me” (Savage? Check.) and 
ends with “For still searching 
for someone to understand 
me better.” And just as the 
final echo of the intro hits the 
eardrum, the irresistible bass 
line of “Keep On” grooves in.

SweetSexySavage 
is 

undeniably front-loaded. The 
first verse on “Distraction” 
boasts Yonce-levels of swag — 
the nation should be begging 
to be Kehlani’s distraction. 
“Undercover” 
interpolates 

lyrics 
from 
Akon’s 
“Don’t 

Matter” with an ease that 
should crown Kehlani the new 
age queen of R&B, and if that 
doesn’t, the line “I’ma tweet 
our inside jokes to the outside 

world” might. And lead single 
“CRZY” embodies all of SSS’s 
strongest qualities: exquisite 
cross-genre 
production, 

cutting, confident lyrics and 
soaring choruses that are easy 
to catch on to without bordering 
on dull.

The album’s latter half would 

benefit from a few cuts, but 
nonetheless still holds some 
of the album’s most striking 
material. The cool distance of 
“Do U Dirty” ’s verses sets up the 
emotive delivery of, “Swear you 
see the good in me” to abruptly 
shift gears only to shift back 
again. 
The 
instrumentation 

of “Get Like” and flow of “In 
My Feelings” rank among the 
album’s most velvety moments 
and the breakdown on “Too 
Much” is too much.

The sexiness and savagery 

are finished by the time the 
final track, “Thank You” rolls 
in. With a backing chorus, 
Kehlani thanks everyone who 
has helped her along the way, 
but let me just say, “No, Kehlani. 
Thank you.” SweetSexySavage 
is a powerhouse of a debut. 
Sonically cohesive and lyrically 
on-brand from start to finish, 
Kehlani has staked her claim.

6 — Friday, February 3, 2017
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

For most regular, moderately 

funny folk — depending on where 
you situate yourself on the spectrum 
— everyday things are either tucked 
away as memories or simply seen 
and forgotten (perhaps for the more 
conscientious bunch 
out there, they are 
recorded in a diary). 
But for some, like 
clever-minded 
comedian 
Steven 

Wright, the day’s 
monotony presents 
a different kind of 
opportunity.

“Whenever 

anyone wakes up 
in 
the 
morning 

until they go to 
sleep at night, thousands of pieces 
of information go past them, and 
some of those pieces can be moved 
around into jokes,” Wright said. “I 
just get jokes from noticing things.”

Wright, who has been cracking 

people up on stage for over three 
decades, is most known for his 
signature 
deadpan, 
monotone 

delivery, 
which 
almost 
seems 

to border on indifference. The 
unexpectedness of a tightly packed 
punch line — in the midst of a blank 
face and lethargic demeanor with 
the added flair of a Boston accent — 
has kept the crowd on the edge of 
their seats through the years.

“I didn’t really think about it until 

someone wrote an article about me 

in the Boston paper after I’d been 
doing comedy for about two years,” 
Wright said about his well-known 
comic style. “That’s the first time I 
saw the word ‘monotone.’ No one 
ever said that to me personally in 
my whole life, then I read that, and 
it has just followed me my whole 
career.”

Being a comedian was something 

Wright 
had 
long 

aspired to be and 
continued to pursue 
as an undergraduate 
liberal arts student.

“It 
was 
my 

dream, it was my 
goal and my life to 
be 
a 
comedian,” 

he said. “So, a year 
after I graduated at 
college in Boston, a 
club opened up, and 
as soon as I knew 

it was there, I started going to the 
open mic nights.”

After three years performing 

at Ding Ho’s Comedy Club and 
Chinese Restaurant in Cambridge, 
Wright was booked for his first 
“Tonight 
Show” 
appearance. 

Producing such a roar from the 
audience, he was invited back the 
following week.

“It was surreal. Of all the things 

I’ve done in my career, that’s still 
my favorite,” Wright said of his 
debut, “going on that show that 
first time.” 

In addition to standup, Wright 

went on to star in multiple films 
and TV shows. He earned himself 
a Grammy nomination in 1985 for 

his debut album, I Have a Pony. 
The sequel, I Still Have a Pony, 
was also nominated in 2007. Since 
2014, Wright has been a producer, 
director and guest star of the 
FX series, Louie, whom Wright 
describes as “brilliant.”

Despite his many detours from 

the stage, including doing the 
animated voice for the upcoming 
animated film, “Emoji,” standup 
remains Wright’s passion and forte.

“To be in a scene is good, but it 

doesn’t have that edge of danger,” 
Wright said. “You can do it again 
and again there’s no one really 
looking at you. But on stage, all 
that energy you get from the crowd 
makes it dangerous and exciting.”

Despite drifting askew from the 

spotlight of stardom, which Wright 
once occupied, he continues to act 
as a legacy and hall-of-famer for 
comedians and the public alike, 
making frequent appearances on 
the stage. For Wright’s performance 
this weekend, audiences can expect 
“eighty minutes of surrealism — a 
weird hour.”

Wright didn’t hesitate to 

impart some of his own career 
wisdom: 
“You 
never 
know 

what’s gonna happen — don’t be 
afraid and don’t stop yourself 
from 
at 
least 
attempting 

whatever 
thing 
comes 
into 

your head,” Wright shared. “If 
it works it works, if it doesn’t it 
doesn’t. At least you tried.”

Wright will bring this fearless 

attitude with his comedy to the 
stage this Saturday.

Migos’ sound defines 2017

Culture, in singular. Anti-

establishment 
skaters, 
dads 

from 
the 
Bronx, 
fraternity 

stoners 
and 

mall-shoppers 
who just really 
like 
memes. 

From the overly 
active 
Twitter-

users 
in 
Vans 

Sk8 Lows, to that Dale from 
Accounting who is actually a 
huge Public Enemy fan — we’re 
all The Culture.

Every now and then there is 

an event that grabs all of “our” 
attention: a cultural singularity 
of sorts that matters to anyone 
who matters. A few months ago 
it felt like we were all listening 
in one room when Frank Ocean 
finally released Blonde; before 
that, Kanye West had us all 
legitimately considering the 
merits of a Tidal account. 
Regardless of our personal 
denominations and sects, we, 
The Culture, collectively tune 
in to select artifacts that will 
be debated in the barber shops 
of our time. Hate it or love it, 
you’ll at least listen.

Migos, the familial Atlanta 

trio 
comprised 
of 
Quavo, 

Takeoff and Offset, have had 
their 
thumbprints 
all 
over 

the sphere of popular culture 
worldwide. 
Though 
they’ve 

only managed fleeting moments 
of crossover success between 
YRN and now, it remains 
undisputed that they’re largely 
responsible for popularizing 
the sound of “now.” As Coke 
has become synonymous with 
all off-brand, inferior sodas, 
Migos now-iconic triplet flow 
has 
become 
the 
automatic 

association of your favorite 
struggling rapper.

Constantly 
teetering 

between the perils of Troy Ave 
and the consistent hit-making 
of Future, Migos seems to have 
ascended to greater cultural 
significance 
without 
ever 

really changing what they’ve 
been doing for the past four 
years. They’ve survived the 
fatal Drake remix, witnessed 
blatant 
flow-thievery, 
and 

probably couldn’t care less. 
With the eyes of the world (and 
more 
importantly, 
Twitter) 

watching, Migos’ latest effort, 
Culture, is their most polished 
and accessible project to date. 
At 13 tracks and 59 minutes in 
length, every last detail feels 
deliberate.

Like a red carpet event, the 

album inevitably kicks off 
with the obligatory DJ Khaled 
feature. 
Though 
his 
mere 

presence 
“Culture” 
is 
the 

audio equivalent of hearing 
“Attention Walmart shoppers” 
in the club, it legitimizes 
the fact that Migos have 
embedded 
themselves 
into 

a position of longevity. The 
feature typically reserved for 
blockbuster events is more of 
a trophy than anything else. 
It’s the victory lap before the 
race has even started; it’s an 

announcement that “Culture 
album coming soon,” on the 
intro of the Culture album 
while 
playing 
the 
Culture 

album. They will no doubt go 
on to be preserved in the great 
pantheon of artists who have 

shared 
a 
studio 

with DJ Khaled, 
which 
will 

dubiously exclude 
the likes of The 
Beatles, etc.

The 
album 

doesn’t really kick into life until 
after the formalities; “T-Shirt,” 
like all Migos songs, is an 
exercise in timing and humor, 
but brings with it an unusually 
pensive edge. Finishing each 
other’s sentences and often 
entire 
verses, 
they 
deviate 

from their triplet staple in 
favor of a more staccato and 
stop-start flow. Takeoff plays 
as the undercover MVP with 

an 
absolutely 
showstopping 

verse, ghosting out screaming 
“country 
grammar, 
n*****, 

straight out Nawf Atlanta !!!!”

“Call 
Casting” 
feels 
like 

a more traditional return to 
their 
Southern 
roots, 
with 

Zaxby’s 
references 
and 
an 

organ so crisp you can almost 
hear the Pyrex boiling in 
the kitchen. The production 
is 
particularly 
interesting 

because most of their Southern 
musical references have been 
explicitly 
rapped, 
whereas 

here they shoutout the likes of 
Andy Milonakis on a beat that 
wouldn’t be out of place on a 
UGK project.

The momentum builds to an 

inevitable peak in the form of 
“Bad and Boujee.” This has got 
to be the best four-track stretch 
of their entire discography 
so far, stemming back to that 
run on YRN from “Versace” 
to “Hanna Montanna.” The 
album seems to have taken note 
from the Cheef Keef model, 
kicking the door in with a 
relentless barrage of heaters 
— the difference here being 
that quality control has limited 
them from overflowing with 
another 22-track tape.

Earlier this month at the 

Golden Globes, Donald Glover 
took the stage to accept his 
award for Best TV Comedy, 
somehow finding a way to 
thank the Migos for making 
this song along the way. The 
memes alone have cemented 
it in the history books, and 
even that damn Lil Uzi verse 
already sounds iconic. We get 
it, “Fight Night” and “Versace” 
were big, but this is massive. 
This is bigger than basement 
parties and blunt cruises; this 
song bangs in Nigeria. The last 
time we saw a single propel a 
rap album to such ridiculous 
heights 
was 
probably 
Lil 

Wayne’s “A Milli” in 2008.

Gucci Mane provides the 

only 
blessing 
that 
matters 

in Atlanta with a feature on 
“Slippery”, weaving in and out 
of the beat without even having 
to try to mimic the Migos. It’s 
not a classic Gucci appearance 
by any means, but he brings 
with him an air of authority — a 
stamp of approval that only he 
can offer.

The album closes with “Out 

Yo Way,” which is a fittingly 
uncharacteristic Migos outro 
for an album unlike anything 
else they’ve ever released. It 
borrows twinges of tropical 
synths from “Pick Up The 
Phone,” which featured Quavo 
and fellow album appearance-
maker 
Travis 
Scott. 
They 

alternate between sing-song 
rapping 
about 
cocaine 
and 

appreciating 
women 
within 

the same verse, reminiscing 
on 
days 
when 
they 
was 

“trappin, cappin’ all through 
the hallway.” Though Culture 
is unique in its brevity and 
newfound 
position 
in 
the 

limelight, it remains as absurd 
as anything Migos have ever 
released.

The main takeaway from 

Culture is that Migos have 
added 
an 
edge 
to 
their 

creative process, transcending 
what 
once 
prevented 

uncompromising 
mixtape-

talents like DMX and Lil B from 
crossing over — a transition 
we’ve seen in the past few years 
with 
fellow 
Atlanta-native 

Young 
Thug, 
who 
recently 

released 
similarly 
polished 

projects in Slime Season 3 and 
Jeffery.

It’s not so much that the 

Atlanta music scene is being 
gentrified for the palette of a 
larger (and whiter) audience, 
but 
rather 
that 
the 
most 

senior figures on the scene are 
maturing and further refining 
their releases. This is a city 
which still claims Lil Yachty 
and Rich The Kid. Atlanta is 
still Atlanta — Migos have 
simply claimed the biggest 
house on the hill. In the words 
of DJ Khaled, Culture is the 
soundtrack to “repping the 
culture from the streets,” but 
it’s novelty lies in the fact that 
“Nawfside” Atlanta actually 
is what Western youth culture 
looks and sounds like in 2017. 
If you’re not with it, then 
congratulations, 
you 
played 

yourself.

Michigan attempts to win on a Friday,
starts home series against Ohio State

Two weeks ago, the Michigan 

hockey team played Michigan 
State in a home-and-home series 
that kicked off at Yost Ice Arena 
on a Friday, and the Wolverines 
fell to the Spartans, 3-0. The 
Friday before, Michigan lost 
to Minnesota, 5-2. And in the 
Wolverines’ 
series 
against 

Wisconsin, 
the 
Wolverines 

lost the Friday opener to the 
Badgers.

Friday wins haven’t come 

easily for Michigan (1-6-1 Big 
Ten, 8-12-2 overall.) The last 
time the Wolverines opened 
a weekend series with a win 
was back on Nov. 11, when they 
topped then-No. 4 Boston in a 
4-0 shutout.

This 
weekend, 
Michigan 

can’t expect it to be any easier. 
No. 11 Ohio State (3-4-1-1, 12-6-
6) is traveling to Ann Arbor for 
a weekend series at Yost, and 

it’s looking for redemption after 
falling to Wisconsin twice last 
weekend.

For the Wolverines, starting 

off the series with a win on 
Friday could make all the 
difference.

“It 
means 
everything,” 

said 
Michigan 

assistant 
head 

coach 
Billy 

Powers. 
“We 

can’t look back, 
but the Fridays 
— in particular in 
the past month, 
month and a half 
— have not been 
good. 
You’re 

really regrouping 
Friday 
night, 

having a chaotic 
Saturday of whatever we have to 
do to get through this weekend 
and survive and get points out of 
it. It’s not a good approach to it.

“You really hope that you 

have a game Friday night that 

gives you a chance to have 
a great weekend instead of 
salvaging a weekend.”

The 
Buckeyes 
feature 
a 

prolific scoring offense, sitting 
second in the NCAA. Seventeen 
members of Ohio State’s roster 
have at least one goal and, 

on 
average, 

the 
Buckeyes 

generate 
four 

goals per game 
— Michigan is 
averaging 
just 

two and a half.

Forward 

Mason 
Jobst 

has 
brought 

recent success 
to 
his 
team, 

recording 
19 

points 
in 
his 

last nine games. Forward Nick 
Schilkey, a captain, is sitting 
on 114 career points, 25 of 
which have come this season. 
In addition to those two, all 23 
skaters on the Buckeyes’ roster 

have at least a point and an 
assist.

“I think the biggest challenge 

we’ll face is shutting down their 
offense,” said freshman forward 
Will Lockwood. “They’re a team 
with a lot of weapons on their 
offense, and we’re definitely a 
team that needs to take pride in 
our (defensive zone).”

For 
the 
Wolverines, 

Lockwood is currently second 
in points scored with seven 
goals and six assists. He falls 
behind 
the 
only 
freshman 

forward Jake Slaker, who is 
boasting a team-high 14 points 
with four goals and 10 assists.

But 
with 
a 
team 
as 

offensively-sound 
as 
Ohio 

State, it will fall on Michigan’s 
defense to really step up. Three 
of the Wolverines’ goaltenders 
— freshmen Hayden Lavigne 
and Jack LaFontaine and senior 
Zach Nagelvoort — have evenly 
split appearances in front of the 
net with eight each. Lavigne 
leads in save percentage with 
.932, while Nagelvoort and 
LaFontaine are trailing him 
with .917 apiece.

In 
blocked 
shots, 
the 

Wolverines lead all Division 
I teams with 18.23 per game. 
Freshman 
defenseman 
Luke 

Martin has recorded a team-
high 52 blocked shots so far 
this season, with sophomore 
defenseman 
Nicholas 
Boka 

following closely behind with 50.

Still, Ohio State will be far 

from an easy win. With such 
an aggressive offense, it will 
be difficult for the Wolverines 
to pull a win out of the series 
despite their ability to block 
shots — regardless of whether 
or not it’s on a Friday.

“We know they’re a really 

good team this year,” said 
senior defenseman Nolan De 
Jong. “They’re fast and pretty 
explosive, 
and 
they’ve 
had 

some ridiculously high-scoring 
games in my four years here, 
so hopefully that won’t happen 
this year. We’re trying to keep 
the score down and play our 
game.”

‘M’ loses tight match 
to Central Michigan

Everyone knew it was going 

to be a close matchup between 
the No. 10 Michigan (3-4 Big 
Ten, 
7-5 

overall) 
wrestling 
team and 
No. 17 Central Michigan (3-2 
Mid-American 
Conference, 

6-2 overall). Falling in line 
with those predictions, the 
Chippewas narrowly edged out 
the Wolverines, 19-18. 

Each team took turns holding 

the lead, and eventually, the 
meet had to be decided by the 
heavyweight bout. Michigan 
elected to put redshirt junior 
Ayoola Olapo in for the usual 
starter, freshman Dan Perry. 
Olapo is usually a part of the 
197-weight class, but due to 
the Wolverines lack of success 
in the heavyweight class, they 
opted to try something new.

“We thought he had the 

best chance of getting a win 
for us,” said Michigan coach 
Joe McFarland. “He’s a little 
bit small for a heavyweight, so 
he’s a little susceptible for that, 
but it was a great match. It just 
didn’t work out for us.”

Central Michigan’s Newton 

Smerchek was able to use his 
weight 
advantage 
against 

Olapo, whose attempts to use 
his quickness faltered. Olapo 
dropped the final match of 
the evening, 1-0, to hand the 
Chippewas their first win over 
the Wolverines in three years.

The entire dual meet wasn’t 

a letdown, though. Many of 
Michigan’s wrestlers earned 
wins over ranked opponents 
that could later factor into 
their 
NCAA 
Championship 

hopes.

Ranked 10th in the latest 

InterMat poll, senior Brian 
Murphy was able to notch 
an 
overtime 
victory 
over 

No. 7 Collin Heffernan in 
the 157-pound weight class. 
After a scoreless first period, 
Heffernan was the first on 

the board with a two-point 
reversal.

But Murphy managed to 

battle back and tie the match, 
sending it into overtime. It took 
him only 20 seconds to secure 
a takedown on the edge of the 
mat and earn a 4-2 decision.

“I like to be more on the 

offense 
in 
the 
overtime,” 

Murphy said. “I don’t like to 
go into the second or third 
overtime 
because 
I 
feel 

like guys can sneak a win 
out, so I like to really push 
for a takedown in the first 
overtime.”

Second-ranked 
redshirt 

freshman Logan Massa made 
sure to keep the momentum 
going in the 165-pound weight 
class. Massa stuck to his usual 
style 
of 
wrestling—taking 

down his opponents and then 
releasing them just to take 
them down again.

With 
five 
takedowns 
in 

the first period and four back 
points in the second, Massa 
cruised to a 21-6 technical fall 
victory with 1:32 left in the 
third period.

The Wolverines won their 

fair 
share 
of 
impressive 

matches, 
especially 
from 

redshirt 
freshman 
Jackson 

Striggow in the 197-pound 
weight class and Stevan Micic 
in the 133-pound weight class. 
But Michigan wasn’t able to 
capitalize when they had the 
chance to pull off the win.

The 
Wolverines 
could 

have made up the lost point 
anywhere. It was the difference 
between a decision and a major 
decision victory or a pin and a 
technical fall. But they simply 
weren’t able to finish on the 
right side of a close matchup.

“I’m looking at the whole 

team and we just didn’t get 
the job done,” McFarland said. 
“We had opportunities, but we 
had some weight classes where 
we could have got extra points 
or maybe not given up points. 
In the end, it was those little 
things that came back and bit 
us.”

Knight seals dominant 
victory for Wolverines

The dual-match had long been 

decided, but you would have 
thought Alex Knight didn’t know 
it.

With the second set tied at four 

games apiece, Princeton’s Luke 
Gamble had just notched a point 
to cut Knight’s lead to 30-15. One 
of Gamble’s teammates cheered 
obnoxiously from the stands, 
perhaps a little too loudly for 
Knight’s liking.

After all, even if Gamble were 

to win the match, the Tigers (0-1) 
were about to leave the Varsity 
Tennis Center with a 5-2 defeat.

And so Knight retaliated, 

letting the arena quiet down 
before exclaiming, “Let’s go 
Blue, 5-1, come on!”

It was a friendly reminder 

of the dominant day Michigan 
men’s tennis team was having, 
and perhaps if you bottled up the 

Wolverines’ constant intensity 
into 
one 
moment, 
Knight’s 

response would be it.

But 
realistically, 
it’s 
no 

surprise 
that 
was 
Knight’s 

reaction prior to clinching the 
final set for the 18th-ranked 
Wolverines to close out the final 
set of the day and give Michigan 
(3-1) a dominant 6-1 victory.

“It’s February 2, so those 

matches — for him and for our 
team — have big implications 
for us,” said Michigan coach 
Adam Steinberg. “I know that 
the guys feel a lot better winning 
6-1 than 5-2. For (Knight), it’s a 
confidence thing.

“That 
really 
helps 
him 

individually going into the next 
match. I was happy the way he 
finished there. I told him he 
played really aggressive, and he 
did things he really is not used to 
doing.”

The 
Wolverines 
put 

themselves on track for victory 

from 
the 
get-go, 
clinching 

the doubles point in dramatic 
fashion. 
Sophomore 
Gabe 

Tishman and freshman Connor 
Johnston won three straight 
games to open up the No. 3 
doubles match, but then lost the 
ensuing four games.

By that time, the other doubles 

teams had split matches, and all 
eyes were on the young Michigan 
duo. Tishman and Johnston 
recovered, closing out the match 
by winning the next three games.

“It puts extra pressure on any 

team,” Steinberg said. “Everyone 

knows that depth is our strength. 
So when we win the doubles 
point I think other teams feel 
it, because they’re like, ‘Wow 
Michigan’s 
really 
good 
one 

through six.’ So we need that.”

With the doubles point in 

Michigan’s back pocket, the 
Wolverines took to the courts for 
singles play.

The Tigers managed to tie 

the dual match at one, if only for 
a moment, when Tom Colautti 
defeated Michigan’s Carter Lin 
handily — 6-2, 6-1 — in the No. 5 
singles match.

But 
senior 
Jathan 
Malik 

quickly put the Wolverines back 
on top, upsetting Alex Day in 
the top singles match. The pair 
traded games throughout the 
first set, but with the set locked 
at 5-4, Malik finally closed the 
door on Day.

Malik only improved from 

there, capturing the second set, 
6-3, and setting the tone for the 
rest of the night.

“For us, me and Myles in the 

middle today, we’ve just got to try 
to create the energy for the courts 
next to us,” Malik said. “And I 
think we generally did a good job. 
It’s obviously always a little bit 
easier when we all won the first 
set on pretty much every court.”

Just a few minutes after 

Malik’s victory, junior Davis 
Crocker 
gave 
Michigan 
a 

3-1 cushion, as he notched a 
convincing 6-4, 6-4 win against 
Davey Roberts at the No. 6 
singles to remain undefeated in 
singles play this season.

By that point, with the way the 

dual match against the Tigers 
was shaping up, the only real 
competition was between Leo 
Hua and Myles Shalet to see who 
could clinch the victory for the 
Wolverines.

In the end, Hua won that 

intra-squad battle, eking out a 7-5 
victory in the second set against 
Kial Kaiser after dominating, 
6-2, in the first.

Shalet needed a 10-8 second-

set tiebreaker to win his own 
match — also maintaining an 
undefeated singles record — 
before Michigan went on to 
watch Knight’s match.

By then, it was 5-1 in favor 

of the Wolverines. And Knight 
filled the silence of the stadium, 
making sure everybody knew it. 

“He’s always got that energy,” 

Malik said. “I think all of us are 
thinking right now that this 
is sort of a pivotal time for us, 
even though it’s the start of the 
season. The matches, even when 
they’re dead rubbers, we want to 
try and go out and win them.”

Wolverines look to rebound against Buckeyes;
Behind Enemy Lines: Ohio State Jae’Sean Tate

After thrashing Indiana by 

30 at home, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team followed the 
impressive performance with the 
polar opposite in East Lansing, 
losing to Michigan State, 70-62.

Michigan stuck around for most 

of the game, but poor shooting 
against a stout defense did the 
Wolverines in, and they missed out 
on a chance to take sole possession 
of fourth place in the Big Ten.

Now, 
the 
Wolverines 
will 

have to right the ship against a 
struggling Ohio State team in 
Crisler Center to keep their NCAA 
Tournament hopes alive.

After a strong non-conference 

showing, which saw the Buckeyes 
start 7-1 with a narrow two-
point loss to No. 9 Virginia, Ohio 
State stumbled out of the gate 
in conference play, starting 0-4 
with losses to Illinois, Purdue, 
Minnesota and Wisconsin.

The Buckeyes recovered and 

won their next two games against 
Michigan State and Nebraska, but 
they have gone just 1-3 since, most 
recently losing to Maryland at 
home.

Much like the Wolverines, Ohio 

State coach Thad Matta’s team has 
been plagued by its defense. Once a 
stout unit in non-conference play, 
the Buckeyes’ defense has wilted, 
and their offense has struggled to 
make up for its deficiencies.

Ohio State is led on offense by 

forward Jae’Sean Tate, who leads 
the team in scoring with 14.3 
points per game. Tate put up a stat 
line of 20 points, four assists, and 
four rebounds against Maryland.

With Tate at the ‘3’, the Buckeyes 

have forwards Marc Loving and 
Trevor Thompson at the ‘4’ and ‘5’, 
respectively. Thompson leads the 

team with 9.2 rebounds per game, 
while Loving averages 5.1 boards.

Thompson and his 7-foot frame, 

especially, will be 
a challenge inside 
for 
Michigan 

sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner.

The Daily sat 

down with Tate 
at Big Ten Media 
Day in October 
to talk about the 
2015-16 
season 

in 
which 
Ohio 

State went 21-14, 
the Buckeyes’ expectations this 
season and his relationship with 
Michigan freshman forward Ibi 
Watson who, like Tate and former 

Wolverine guard Caris LeVert, 
attended 
Pickerington 
High 

School Central.

The Michigan 

Daily: Reflecting 
on last season, a 
little bit up and 
down, what did 
you 
take 
away 

from a year when 
the 
team 
was 

young and you 
still managed to 
string 
together 

some success?

Jae’Sean Tate: 

Last year, it was 

definitely a humbling one and I 
learned a lot from it. We learned 
how important the summer is. 
We learned how important out 

of conference play is. We learned 
how important buying into what 
Coach Matta said is.

So 
all 
those 

things right there 
are the reasons 
why we weren’t 
successful, 
why 

we went to the 
NIT. 
We 
were 

what, 
a 
game 

or 
two 
away 

from 
making 

the 
(NCAA) 

Tournament? 
Not being ready, 
not preparing the 
right way, not being ready to play 
in the out of conference games, 
that’s the reason why.

TMD: Do you think that came 

from youth, from a little bit lack 
of experience? What was it in your 
mind?

JT: I felt it was 

just preparation, 
not 
respecting 

your 
opponents, 

not finishing our 
games. 
There 

were some times 
when we’d be up 
at halftime or 10 
minutes going in, 
and we’d just lose 
it. But also, I feel 
like (it was) a little 
bit of being young.

We made some of the wrong 

decisions, but I feel like that year 
— two years under our belt — will 
help us. Also bringing in Coach 

Jent, and Coach Matta taking a 
different approach in coaching 
and helping us learn on and off the 
court, I feel like this year should 
be a good one.

TMD: Where do you guys set 

the bar for this year, given that 
you’re still a young roster but 
you’re young with experience?

JT: Just to know that we 

can’t make the same mistakes 
that we did last year. Like I said, 
the preseason work and the 
out of conference play matters. 
Finishing out games matters. The 
expectation is that we go into 
every game ready. There were 
some times during the season 
where we weren’t ready to play 
and we’d go down 10. Now we’re 
in the hole (down by) 10 and we’re 
fighting for our life.

TMD: 
You 
mentioned 
a 

difference in how you approached 
the summer. Is it in terms of 
attitude 
at 
those 
(summer) 

workouts or number of workouts?

JT: Not even that, it’s just 

doing what you’re supposed to do. 
 

Whether that’s not missing a rep, 
being on time, doing work, being 
on time to class — just being an 
all-around good person you know 
what I mean? Because it shows, if 
you do what you’re supposed to off 
the court, it helps you on the court.

TMD: I know you played with 

Caris, but did you also play with 
Ibi?

JT: Ibi played with my brother. 

When I graduated he came to Pick 
Central, but I’m still really good 
friends with Ibi.

TMD: Off the top of your head, 

is there anything you got to see in 
him that impressed you?

JT: His shooting. He’s a great 

shooter, he’s athletic and I feel 
like he can have a great impact for 
Michigan. There’s been countless 
times I’ve went back to Pick 
Central and played against him, 
and he’s one of the better guys that 
I’ve played against in his class.

‘M’ returns home eager to 
defend undefeated streak

At 
Crisler 
Center, 
the 

Michigan women’s basketball 
team is known for its third-
quarter 
dominance. 
They 

typically 
outscore 
opponents 
in 

the 
first 
ten 

minutes 
after 

the half. 

Yet, 
the 

Wolverines 
recently 
took 

their prowess 
on 
the 
road 

to 
Urbana-

Champaign, 
scoring 26 out 
of 
their 
86 

total points in 
the third. 

Michigan 
(7-2 
Big 
Ten, 

18-5 overall) will now have 
an opportunity to keep its 
momentum going in Sunday’s 
game against Iowa (5-4, 14-8). 
The Wolverines have yet to lose 
a game in their own arena, and 
they will be looking to maintain 
their home-court advantage. 
The last time the two team’s 
met was in last year’s Big Ten 
Tournament, 
where 
the 

Hawkeyes 
managed 
to 

steal the game, 
97-85. 

“(Last 
year’s 

game) 
was 
a 

great game in 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament,” 
Michigan coach 
Kim 
Barnes 

Arico said after 
the 
Illinois 
game. 
“(Senior 

guard Siera Thompson) got in 
foul trouble in that game and I 
thought that really hurt us. 

“Iowa’s a great team. We 

were up big early against on 
them, and that hurt us.” 

The Hawkeyes rank second 

in the Big Ten, and 10th 
nationally, in assists per game, 
averaging 
18.3. 
Similarly, 

Iowa is in third-place in the 
conference for total assists 
with 384. Michigan doesn’t 
quite match up to the Hawkeyes 
in this respect, averaging 17.0 
per game in conference play. 
Thompson leads the charge 
with 124 total for the season. 
Thompson 
is 

also 
just 
28 

points 
away 

from 
breaking 

into Michigan’s 
all-time scorers 
list. 

Freshman 

guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick has 
the most after 
Thompson’s 
assists 
efforts, 

but she still has 
a total of just 70. 

Gondrezick 
has 
had 
a 

successful week, earning both 
Big Ten Player and Freshman 
of 
the 
Week 
honors 
after 

helping 
Michigan 
dominate 

Northwestern, 80-54, on Jan. 
24. She tied her career highs 
in both points with 22 and 
rebounds with seven and sunk 
a career-high six 3-pointers. 
It was the first time she 
earned the Player of the Week 

award, but the 
fourth time for 
the 
freshman 

award.

The 

performance 
snagged 
Gondrezick the 
US 
Basketball 

Writers 
Association 
Freshman of the 
Week 
award, 

too. 

Gondrezick’s 
offensive 

efforts — she averages 13.7 
points per game — are matched 
by sophomore center Hallie 
Thome 
and 
junior 
guard 

Katelynn 
Flaherty. 
Thome 

averages 15 points per game, 
and Flaherty a whopping 20. 

Flaherty 
will 
have 
to 

measure up to Hawkeye guard 
Ally Disterhoft, who ranks 

third on Iowa’s all-time career 
scoring list. She has amassed 
1,876 career points and is on 
the hunt for first. 

Thome, Flaherty, Gondrezick 

Thompson 
and 
junior 

guard Jillian Dunston have 
consistently started in the past 

eight games this 
season. 
Senior 

guard 
Danielle 

Williams 
is 

the only player 
outside of the 
starting five to 
play 
in 
every 

game 
— 
she 

has a total of 
409 
minutes 

this 
season. 

Williams 
and 

sophomore 
guard 
Nicole 

Munger — who has played in 
21 games for 261 total minutes 
— have a 50-percent shooting 
average on threes.

The 
Wolverines 
game 

against the Hawkeyes will be 
the culmination of Michigan’s 
Alumni weekend. 

“I think it’s going to be a 

great basketball game because 
we’re very similar in a lot of 
ways,” Barnes Arico said. “But 
we’re at home, so I think that’s 
worth (something).” 

Michigan 
sits 
firmly 
in 

third place in the conference, 
whereas Iowa just managed to 
claim fifth. The Hawkeyes had 
their most recent win against 
Rutgers 
on 
Thursday 
after 

falling to No. 3 Maryland on 
Jan. 29 with a final score of 
100-81. 

If the Wolverines continue 

dominating the third quarter 
and match the offense led by 
Iowa’s Disterhoft, they could 
be in for a comfortable win. 

“(The Hawkeyes) are a good 

team,” Barnes Arico said. “We 
just seem to be playing with 
really good confidence at home. 
We love our home crowd, we 
love the fans we’ve been able 
to get and our kids really enjoy 
the 
atmosphere 
and 
really 

enjoy playing there.”
