This article is the second part 

of a two-part investigation by The 
Michigan Daily into allegations of 
sexual misconduct against computer 
science professor Walter Lasecki and 
the University of Michigan’s handling of 
these allegations. It is based on emails, 
documents, notes and interviews with 
12 individuals knowledgeable of these 
events. 

Part one focused on the allegations 

against Lasecki and the divergent 
conclusions of the University’s Office for 
Institutional Equity and the Association 
for Computing Machinery, an outside 
research organization.

CW: 
Sexual 
harassment 
and 

misconduct

Though 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Office of Institutional 
Equity (OIE) ultimately determined 
that a “preponderance of evidence” did 
not support four allegations of sexual 
misconduct against computer science 
professor Walter Lasecki, the School 
of Information (SI) faculty made their 
feelings very clear in the months 
before this finding was released: the SI 
faculty did not want Lasecki to remain 
one of them.

In February 2020, even before OIE 

had finished its investigation and 
made a determination, the SI faculty 

voted to revoke Lasecki’s courtesy 
appointment, which had allowed him 
to advise SI students and maintain 
an SI office space. According to 
emails obtained by The Daily, Lasecki 
resigned his courtesy appointment 
and forfeited these privileges before 
the results of the faculty vote could be 
enforced.

But at the College of Engineering, 

Lasecki maintains his position on the 
faculty of the Computer Science and 
Engineering (CSE) department. He did 
not teach for this department during 
the 2020-2021 academic year.

In a CSE town hall meeting in 

February 2021, CSE Chair Michael 
Wellman told the department that 
OIE had not found Lasecki in violation 
of any University policies. According 
to three individuals present at the 
meeting, Wellman read a statement 
co-written by Lasecki in which Lasecki 
apologized for unspecified actions.

In February 2020 and again in 

August 2020, dozens of concerned 
faculty and staff sent letters to 
University President Mark Schissel 
and Provost Susan Collins regarding 
the 
allegations 
against 
Lasecki. 

Correspondence 
reviewed 
by 

The Daily confirms that Schlissel 
responded to the first one, while 
Collins responded to the second. 

In November 2019, four students 

filed complaints of alleged sexual 
harassment and misconduct against 
Lasecki with the University’s OIE 

and the Association for Computing 
Machinery 
(ACM), 
a 
prominent 

computer 
science 
research 

organization. 

In July 2020, OIE found that Lasecki 

had not violated the University’s sexual 
harassment policies. In February 2021, 
ACM banned Lasecki for at least 
five years under their Policy Against 
Harassment.

Lasecki did not respond to multiple 

emails requesting comment for this 
article. In statements to OIE obtained 
by The Daily, he denied the allegations 
against him.

All 
University 
administrators 

mentioned in this article declined to 
comment, instead redirecting The 
Daily to University spokesperson Rick 
Fitzgerald.

‘CSE could have done more, had 

they wanted to; they chose not to act’ 

Three of the four allegations 

filed with the University were from 
non-University 
students. 
They 

requested anonymity, citing Lasecki’s 
prominence in the field and their 
fear of retribution. As in Part One of 
this investigative series, they will be 
referred to as Jane, Alex and Rachel. 
These three students allege that 
Lasecki harassed them and touched 
them 
inappropriately 
at 
social 

gatherings and industry conferences 
between 2016 and 2018. 

Hundreds 
of 
protestors 

gathered in front of Larcom City 
Hall in Ann Arbor on Saturday 
to express their support for 
Palestinians. Several protestors 
waved Palestinian flags in the air. 
Cardboard cutouts bore phrases 
like “Free Palestine” and ”End 
the Occupation,” while others 
carried the names of Palestinians 
who lost their lives to the Israeli 
Defense Forces. 

U-M 
Dearborn 
Business 

junior Maha Faisal, one of the 
protesters, 
said 
continuing 

to protest was important for 
spreading awareness now that 
people are paying attention to 
the way that the actions of Israel 
are affecting Palestinans.

“We’re putting pressure on 

the whole world to be doing 
something,” Faisal said.

Before people began marching 

from 
City 
Hall 
down 
East 

William 
Street, 
South 
State 

Street and throughout downtown 
Ann Arbor, several community 
members spoke to the protestors 
gathered in front of City Hall. 

U-M faculty member Dr. Abdul 

el-Sayed, a doctor and politician, 
began his speech saying he 
came as a “doctor, American 
and human being.” The former 
candidate for Michigan governor 
discussed his work in educating 
people about COVID-19. He said 
as a doctor, he was upset that the 
U.S. set conditions that put the 
health of Palestinian civilians at 
risk during the pandemic. 

“I’ve watched (as) 3.5 billion 

dollars 
of 
our 
government 

taxpayer money (has) funded 
a military that has destroyed 
testing facilities for COVID-
19, killed some of the leading 
doctors in Gaza, and kicked off 
a third wave of COVID-19 in the 
Gaza strip,” el-Sayed said.

El-Sayed 
also 
discussed 

how he is using his voice as an 
American to speak out against 
injustice 
where 
he 
sees 
it, 

understanding that the U.S.

The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

Central Student Government (CSG) 
hosted a “Community Concerns” 
panel during the sixth meeting of the 
11th CSG assembly. Students, alumni 
and staff voiced their concerns or 
support for CSG leadership’s recent 
statement of solidarity with the 
Palestinian community, which was 
released last Tuesday. 

In the statement, executive team 

members of CSG wrote that they 
recognize anti-Palestinian sentiment 
on campus, the University’s refusal 
to divest from Israeli companies 
that they say contributes to the 
violence, and CSG’s past complicity 
in participating in annual trips that 
support the Israeli government. The 
CSG leaders closed their statement 
by promoting H.R.2590, a bill that 
urges U.S President Joe Biden and his 
administration to withdraw taxpayer 
money from funding the Israeli 
military. 

“Palestinians have been pushed 

out of the political discourse and have 
been censored,” the statement said. 
“Our solidarity with Palestinians is 
late but necessary and we aim to do 
whatever is in our power to ensure that 
we remain in lockstep with them and 
their fight against oppression.”

Solidarity with Palestinians
The panel opened with rising 

Public Policy junior Mahnoor Imran, 
who said she supported the CSG 
statement. Imran said as an incoming 
Ford student, she was particularly 
disappointed by the separate statement 
released 
by 
CSG 
Representative 

Emma Sandberg, who wrote she held 
a neutral stance in regards to Palestine 
and Israel.

“Let me be very clear: neutrality 

entrenches oppression,” Imran said. 
“The CSG statement in support of 
Palestinian liberation is one step. I 
urge us and challenge us to take more 
(steps) on this campus.” 

Another speaker, rising LSA junior 

Salma Ammar Hamamy, said what 
Palestinians are experiencing is more 
than a two-sided conflict, but is instead 
an imbalance of power that is rarely 
acknowledged by the media.

“I’m not here to make the colonizers 

feel comfortable when the mainstream 
media decides to broadcast broken 
windows of an Israeli building 
rather than thousands of innocent 

Palestinians killed,” Hamamy said. “If 
you only like to talk about the reaction 
of the oppressed, rather than the cause 
of the oppression, congratulations 
—you play a vital role in keeping 
colonialism and genocide.” 

Due to a high volume of petitioners, 

CSG hosted another virtual session on 
Wednesday to give more students the 
opportunity to voice their concerns 
and opinions on the crisis in Israel. 
LSA rising senior Hadeel Abulenin, 
one of the student callers, expressed 
disbelief regarding the poor treatment 
of Palestinians. 

“Even animals are treated better 

than the people who live in Gaza, 
which is unbelievable,” Abulenin said. 
“How can you with any conscience 
look at what’s happening there and say 
yes, this is a government that I fully 
support.” 

Students Allied for Freedom and 

Equality (SAFE) members — rising 
Engineering senior Nadine Samaha, 
rising LSA senior Jacob Sirhan and 
rising Public Policy senior Jinan 
Abufarha — also pledged their support 
for the CSG statement. Sirhan, the 
co-president of SAFE, said Palestinian 
students and activists on the U-M 
campus have been targeted and 
doxxed on websites for advocating on 
behalf of the Palestinian people. Sirhan 
said the CSG statement was a positive 
step towards making the University 
community feel more inclusive for 
Palestinian students.

“Year 
after 
year, 
Palestinians 

have come to CSG, as well as (to) 
administrators, to beg for their 
humanity,” 
Sirhan 
said. 
“This 

victimization means that Palestinians 
are only read through loss and need, 
and in many ways, that has been self 
internalized. Truth is a precursor to 
recovery and deliberation — the CSG 
statement took these steps.”

Abufarha said she feels like the 

CSG statement amplified her voice 
along with the voices of blacklisted 
Palestinian activists who have been 
made fearful to speak up for decades. 

“From an extremely young age, my 

mother taught me that the condition 
of being Palestinian in this country is 
to wrap yourself in your silences and 
swallow a baseline level of violence 
against your existence,” Abufarha said.

Abufarha said it was tiresome to 

constantly share trauma and have her 
concerns reduced to being too political 
for powerful institutions to confront.

Solidarity Statement

University 
of 
Michigan 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

announced a commitment to a 
new plan that will achieve carbon 
neutrality by 2040 across all three 
U-M campuses at Thursday’s 
Board of Regents meeting.

The plan’s release comes after 

the completion of the President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 

Neutrality’s (PCCN) final report in 
March 2021. The report outlined 
strategies and recommendations 
for the University to achieve 
specific carbon neutrality goals 
and benchmarks, many of which 
appear in the plan announced at 
the meeting.

The plan aims to eliminate 

scope 1 emissions, which derive 
directly from the University’s 
operations, by 2040. The PCCN’s 
recommendation 
of 
carbon 

neutrality, inclusive of carbon 
offsets, for this scope’s emissions 
by 2025 was not addressed in 
the plan. Schlissel said he would 
evaluate carbon offsets — the 
practice 
of 
counting 
carbon 

sequestrations that the University 
contributes 
to 
financially 

elsewhere towards neutrality — in 
the future.

The University plan aims to 

achieve carbon neutrality for 
scope 2 emissions, which come 
from the purchase of power off 
campus, by 2025. Defined goals 
for achieving carbon neutrality for 
scope 3 emissions, which are any 
emissions indirectly related to the 
University, will also be laid out by 
2025, according to the plan. The 
latter two goals are in alignment 
with those of the PCCN.

To achieve the elimination 

of these scopes, the University 
outlined multiple steps. Some 
of 
these 
include 
committing 

to 
geothermal 
heating 
and 

cooling 
projects, 
electrifying 

Ann Arbor and Dearborn’s bus 
fleets, requesting that off campus 
electricity purchases come from 
renewable sources and creating an 
executive-level leadership position 
that will monitor the progress of 
these carbon neutrality initiatives. 
The University also plans to create 
a dashboard that will track the 
progress of these goals.

Schlissel expressed excitement 

about taking charge towards a 
more carbon neutral future at the 
University.

“To fulfill our mission as a 

public research university, we 
must address the climate crisis by 
leading the way on our campuses 
and 
beyond, 
creating, 
testing 

and teaching the knowledge and 
technologies that will transfer 
to other large institutions, and 
inspiring and empowering others 
to solve the defining scientific 
and social challenge of our time,” 
Schlissel said.

The University also hopes to 

uphold 
a 
community 
culture 

which values sustainability. The 
plan outlines steps to achieve 
this goal, such as incorporating 
environmental justice principles 
into the University’s decision-
making process, engaging with 
the communities around the three 
campuses about climate equity 
and investing in carbon neutrality 
research efforts.

Schlissel 
emphasized 
how 

important community involvement 
will be in the implementation of 
the new climate neutrality plan.

Regents, Schlissel commit to plan for 
U-M-wide carbon neutrality by 2040

ALEC COHEN/Daily


A class action complaint was 

filed in the U.S. District Court 
for the Eastern District of 
Michigan on Thursday against 
the University of Michigan for 
its handling of allegations of 
sexual assault against former 
University doctor Robert E. 
Anderson. The complaint, in 
order to prevent and respond 
to sexual violence on the U-M 
campus, seeks a court order 
that will require the University 
to carry out major reforms 
surrounding 
the 
school’s 

best-practice 
policies 
and 

procedures related to sexual 
and gender-based abuse on 
campus.

“The 
patient-physician 

relationship involves a solemn 
commitment and trust,” the 
complaint reads. “Without trust, 
how could a physician expect 
patients to reveal the full extent 
of 
their 
medically 
relevant 

history, expose themselves to 
the physical exam, or act on 
recommendations for tests or 
treatments? For decades, the 
University of Michigan allowed 
and enabled a physician in its 
employ, Dr. Robert E. Anderson 
to continuously violate that 
solemn trust.”

The complaint, which lists 

a series of reforms and best-
practices, 
states 
that 
the 

University needs to implement 
more training and education, 
and add additional policies for 
how to identify, prevent and 
respond to sexual and gender-
based assault. It also seeks 
to appoint an “independent 
monitor” 
to 
oversee 
the 

implementation 
of 
these 

policies and report on progress 
to the court. 

Some lawyers representing 

plaintiffs, 
like 
Annika 
K. 

Martin, 
made 
statements 

providing support to victims of 
Anderson.

“Everyone who was abused 

by Robert Anderson – including 
those who may not be ready 
to come forward – deserves 
an opportunity to hold U-M 
accountable and have their voice 

heard,” Martin said. “U-M has 
repeatedly failed to implement 
policies that put students first, 
and accordingly this complaint 
seeks relief through the court 
to ensure they will.”

Led by LSA junior Josephine 

Graham, the complaint is a 
companion to a suit filed in 
March 2020 by survivors of 
abuse at the hands of Anderson. 
The 
complaint 
alleges 
the 

University 
and 
its 
Regents 

enabled 
Anderson’s 
sexual 

abuse of students from 1968 
until 2003. 

“The Anderson case is one 

of many at U-M rooted in the 
university’s 
pervasive 
and 

broken culture mirroring our 
greater society,” Graham said 
in a press release. “Gender-
based violence is a complex, 
systemic issue that requires 
systemic solutions to prevent 
and eradicate it.”

More than 70 individual 

lawsuits 
have 
been 
filed 

in 
federal 
court, 
but 
the 

class action suit, unlike the 
individual 
lawsuits 
which 

only 
represent 
specific 

plaintiffs, seeks to prosecute 
the University on behalf of all 
students affected by Anderson 
— even those who may not be 
ready to come forward.

Since 
October 
2020, 
the 

lawyers 
representing 
the 

University and the lawyers who 
brought the original class action 
suit have been in negotiations. 
A settlement could cost the 
University millions of dollars 
in damages to the hundreds of 
alleged victims of Anderson’s 
abuse. 

The law firm WilmerHale 

completed their independent 
investigation of the allegations 
against Anderson last week. 
The investigation concluded 
that there was “no doubt” about 
the fact that the hundreds of 
complaints against Anderson 
were credible and Anderson 
exhibited a consistent pattern 
of 
misconduct. 
The 
report 

outlines recommendations for 
the University to follow in order 
to improve upon their practices 
and 
procedures 
regarding 

sexual assault.

In a normal semester, Good 

Time Charley’s — the Ann Arbor 
bar located in the heart of the South 
University Avenue district — would 
be packed shoulder-to-shoulder 
with students and community 
members gathered to watch sports 
games or celebrate St. Patrick’s 
Day. But since the pandemic 
began, Charley’s and other local 
small businesses have received 
less business and faced additional 
challenges. 

Charley’s 
co-owner 
Adam 

Lowenstein said since March of 
2020, Charley’s has suffered a 
60% decrease in sales, along with 
multiple different shut-downs and 
a minor fire caused by an outside 
heater. Lowenstein said the fire was 
“the cherry on top” to an already 
hard year with the pandemic.

“The whole year was a major 

blow,” Lowenstein said. “It was 
kind of a crazy year where we had 
to just adapt on the fly and adjust to 
everything that was being thrown 
at us.”

Ann 
Arbor 
businesses 
like 

Charley’s 
experienced 
major 

declines in sales, staff, in-person 
capacity and store hours over 
the course of the fall and winter 
semesters due to public health 
guidelines 
set 
by 
the 
state 

and 
University 
of 
Michigan 

administration. Lowenstein and 
other small business owners were 
forced to completely alter their 
traditional business models due 
to COVID-19, and will continue to 
navigate running a small business 
through the aftermath of the 
pandemic.

Lowenstein said the constant 

fluctuations in curfew policies, 
capacity and more challenged 
Charley’s 
traditional 
business 

model. 

“We’ve had to alter our business 

model entirely,” Lowenstein said. 
“We’ve 
shortened 
our 
hours; 

focused more on takeout and 
delivery; we’ve not done a happy 
hour; we’re doing a lot more 
regular sit-down restaurant sales. 
A business model like that is not 
profitable.” 

During the fall and winter 

months, Charley’s relied heavily on 
their newly updated takeout and 
delivery service, which includes 

alcoholic beverages, as well as 
the warmer weather that allows 
for maximized outdoor seating. 
However, Lowenstein said that 
even with these successes, the 
fluctuating 
rise 
of 
COVID-19 

cases in Ann Arbor still presented 
difficulties for Charley’s.

“The 
hardest 
part 
is 
the 

uncertainty: trying to always be 
changing and always be adapting 
and not knowing when you’re going 
to be able to just go back to normal,” 
Lowenstein said. 

Zingerman’s 
Delicatessen, 

another Ann Arbor and U-M 
community favorite, has been 
closed for in-person dining since 
the pandemic began in March 
2020. Jennifer Hall, marketing 
and communications manager for 
Zingerman’s, said, like Charley’s, 
Zingerman’s had to completely 
revise their original business model 
by implementing new programs.

“We’re 
always 
looking 
for 

change and are able to experiment 

with different approaches and 
take the best of what we learn 
in that work and then try it out,” 
Hall said. “If it works, it’s great, 
and if it doesn’t work, we try 
again. So we’ll continue to do that, 
we’ll continue to look for ways to 
improve and opportunities to make 
changes across our operations and 
our service to meet whatever the 
demands of the time are.”

Zingerman’s 
“Reuben 
Tour” 

was one of the new ideas the 
business put together last summer 
in the hopes of increasing business. 
According to Hall, the “Reuben 
Tour” was a success and could be 
repeated this upcoming summer. 

“We took orders from people in 

different cities like Kalamazoo and 

Grand Rapids and Detroit,” Hall 
said. “Last summer, people weren’t 
traveling very much outside of their 
own communities, so they placed 
orders with us, and then we took 
the orders out to them. It was like a 
giant takeout project, and that was 
a great idea. We have a lot of people 
who were super interested and they 
loved it.” 

Ann Arbor Councilmember Ali 

Ramlawi, D-Ward 5, is the owner 
and operator of Jerusalem Garden. 
He said there is adversity rooted in 
keeping a business alive and well 
during an ongoing pandemic. 

“When you can’t plan in business, 

it’s very stressful,” Ramlawi said. 
“You want to plan for your staff, 
how you train your staff, how 
much staff to have, how much food 
to have. And you would get these 
dictates at the last minute, and you 
got to redraw your plans again. 
You’re trying to run a business, and 
with anything business you want to 
be consistent with everything, and 

there was very little consistency in 
the last year.”

Ramlawi also discussed the 

ongoing struggles and battles small 
businesses in Ann Arbor have to 
endure and try to overcome. 

“As 
entrepreneurs, 
small 

business owners and restaurateurs, 
we are creative, fighters, hard 
workers, and we show up every day 
and we know every day is a new 
day,” Ramlawi said. “Even though 
yesterday was one of the worst days 
you’ve had in a long time, you’d 
come back, dust yourself off, show 
up again, hope that your staff joins 
you, and you fight to live to see 
another day.”

anticipate better prospects for the fall

he strawberry dress. The 
crossover 
leggings. 
The 

Vivianne Westwood pearl 

choker. There are endless examples 
of fashion trends that TikTok has 
breathed into existence. This relatively 
new smartphone application has 
so much ownership over these 
trends that their original names are 
frequently tossed aside in favor of “the 
TikTok (insert article of clothing).” As 
an Aerie employee, I saw the buying 
power behind TikTok firsthand as 
I watched girls swarm to our store 
for months in search of “the TikTok 
leggings,” a term that can be linked 
to both Aerie’s crossover leggings 
or 
Amazon’s 
scrunch 
leggings. 

TikTok’s seemingly endless amount 
of discomfiting content and young 
audience have built a connotation of 
thoughtlessness around the platform. 
But seeing droves of people who had 
never been in an Aerie before walk 
in with such purpose and interest 
illustrated the tangible effects of this 
deceptively simple app. 

For an app that is so commonly 

deemed to be “stupid” or “for middle 
school girls” — an insult rooted in 
the well-established tradition of 
delegitimizing female interests — 
TikTok has created an impressive 
amount of careers for users in a 
relatively short period of time right 
from their own bedrooms. However, 
TikTokers are rarely given the 
respect that influencers on other 
apps are given. Whether or not their 
content deserves this respect is 
dependent on both the TikToker and 
the perspective of the viewer. With 
their problematically superfluous 
associations with the fashion industry, 
fashion TikTokers are often seen 
in a materialistic manner. However, 
considering the 156,000 emails Aerie 
received from customers asking to be 

put on the waitlist for the crossover 
leggings, this “materialism” resonates 
with audiences of a multitude of 
different backgrounds.

At some point, we have to ask 

ourselves: Is liking clothing and the 
way it can make you feel frivolous, 
or is the assumption that these 
interests are frivolous, frivolous itself? 
Similarly, is TikTok thoughtless, 
or is that connotation a result of 
thoughtlessness? Many people make 
a pointed effort to separate themselves 
from what society generally considers 
to be unimportant. In terms of 
TikTok and fashion, two subjects that 
are frequently discredited, TikTok’s 
ability to get people to spend money — 
a metric American capitalism places 
particular emphasis on, for better or 
for worse — stands in stark opposition 
to the perception of frivolity around 
the two.

The subject of a TikTok does not 

seem to affect the popularization 
of a specific piece of clothing. Even 
videos that have nothing to do with 
what the creator is wearing have 
gone viral due to their clothing. The 
particular TikTok that sparked the 
frenzy around the aforementioned 
leggings was a simple dancing video. 
This trend embodies the constant 
presence of the fashion industry in 
our lives. Just by dancing, Hannah 
Schlenker, the creator who made the 
video that began the craze, caused 
Aerie stores all across the country 
to sell out of the leggings — an item 
that, from my experience working 
there, had not been performing well 
for months.

W

ho is the first Colombian 
you can think of? Maybe 
it’s a popular musician, 

like Shakira or J Balvin. Maybe it’s 
an athlete, like weightlifter Oscar 
Figueroa or soccer player Carlos 
Valderrama. Or maybe it’s an actor, 
like “Modern Family” star Sofia 
Vergara or “Ice Age” star John 
Leguizamo — who, in researching 
this piece, I was surprised to find was 
born in Colombia.

In any case, the answer is probably 

not former President Alvaro Uribe. 
This is not terribly surprising; the 
only foreign leaders most Americans 
consistently seem to recognize 
are British Prime Ministers and 
long-time leaders of enemy nations, 
like Fidel Castro. Nevertheless, he 
is probably the most important 
figure in shaping Colombia over 
the last two decades. During his 
administration from 2002 to 2010, 
he 
implemented 
far-reaching 

neoliberal economic reforms such 
as privatization of state-owned 
enterprises and strong economic 
deregulation. He also cracked down 
on the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia, or FARC, a guerrilla 
insurgency that had been on one 
side of the nation’s decades-long 
civil war, reducing its membership 
from 20,000 to 8,000. He was 
incredibly popular throughout his 
presidency, winning re-election in 
2006 with around 62.4% of the vote 
and leaving office with an approval 

rating of 75%. It is unsurprising that 
both of his successors, Juan Manuel 
Santos and current President Iván 
Duque, are both deeply connected to 
Uribe, with the former having been 
his Minister of National Defense and 
the latter’s party, Democratic Center, 
having been founded by Uribe.

All of this popularity comes in 

spite of the fact that Uribe and his 
government’s security forces, in 
their effort to vanquish FARC, 
enacted untold amounts of brutality 
toward Colombian civilians. The 
most notable examples of this 
are the series of murders known 
as the “false positives” scandal. 
During Uribe’s presidency, civilians, 
often poor and mentally ill, were 
promised high-paying jobs, lured 
into remote areas, killed by military 
officials and officially recorded as 
FARC militants to inflate military 
kill totals. Until these murders 
were revealed in 2008, the military 
officials involved were frequently 
given promotions for the estimated 
10,000 killings between 2002 and 
2010. Additionally, Uribe and a 
number of his allies were found to 
have ties to right-wing paramilitary 
groups, which over the course of 
the civil war killed around 100,000 
civilians. Horrifyingly, all of this 
was carried out with U.S. funds as 
part of the Plan Colombia program, 
which pledged $10 billion between 
2000 and 2015 to Colombia to fight 
both FARC and drug trafficking. Its 

principal advocates included then-
Senator Joe Biden.

Why is this relevant to today?
Over 
the 
past 
few 
weeks, 

Colombia has been engulfed by 
protests. These protests started 
over a since-scrapped plan by the 
Duque administration to raise taxes 
on the poor, but they have now 
broadened to include frustrations 
over the government’s handling 
of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
the fact that it has broken the 2016 
peace deal with FARC — killing a 
number of social movement leaders 
and former FARC fighters. The 
police’s response to these protests 
has been swift and brutal, killing 39 
protestors, arbitrarily detaining 900 
and sexually assaulting 12, according 
to human rights group Temblores y 
Indepaz. One of the most prominent 
voices in favor of this crackdown 
has been Uribe himself, whose 
tweet 
expressing 
support 
for 

police was removed by Twitter 
for “glorifying violence.” This type 
of violence against protestors is not 
unprecedented for Duque. In 2019, 
protests over police brutality were 
met with police brutality themselves, 
with one estimate stating that 13 
protestors were killed by police in 
the first two days alone.

the frog can definitively say the water 
has suddenly become too hot, there 
is usually no single, objective point 
where a system becomes too illiberal 
to be considered a real democracy. For 
instance, although America has free 
and fair elections, it also has several 
hugely unrepresentative political insti-
tutions and a rash of voter restrictions. 
These limitations obviously don’t make 
America a totalitarian dictatorship à 
la North Korea, but they do certainly 
make it less democratic than it could be.

With that in mind, Americans must 

confront the fact that the country’s 
metaphorical pot of water is heating. 
For decades, American democracy 
has — according to Daniel Ziblatt and 
Steven Levitsky, the authors of “How 
Democracies Die” — survived through 
mutual toleration and political forbear-
ance.

Op-Ed: GEO’s fight for the right to boycott

Op-Ed: It can happen here

OPINION

ZACK BLUMBERG | SENIOR OPINION EDITOR

O

n Thursday, April 22, repre-
sentatives from the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization met 

with University of Michigan admin-
istrators to discuss an issue of free 
speech on campus — the right to exer-
cise freedom of conscience through 
the refusal of letters of recommenda-
tion. The discussion revealed the Uni-
versity’s current policy, or “governing 
principle,” for what it is: an attack on 
academic freedom designed not to 
protect students or faculty, but only to 
shield the University from controversy 
and liability.

This right has been under attack 

at the University of Michigan since 
2018 when, in separate incidents, two 
instructors — Professor John Cheney-
Lippold and a graduate student 
instructor — declined requests for rec-
ommendations from students wishing 
to study in Israel. Writing these letters 
would have gone against the academic 
boycott of Israel in support of Palestin-
ian human rights, and both instructors 
declined them for that reason. Even 

though 
Cheney-Lippold, 
associate 

professor of American Culture, was 
exercising his constitutional right to 
free speech, U-M leaders nevertheless 
issued severe sanctions, including the 
loss of his upcoming sabbatical and a 
denial of a merit-based raise for one 
year. The graduate student instructor 
received a formal letter of admonish-
ment from her department chair with 
implied threats of dismissal from the 
graduate program if such behavior 
were to happen again. What’s more, 
University President Mark Schlis-
sel and then-Provost Martin Phil-
bert issued a public statement that 
denounced both instructors.

The punishment meted out to Pro-

fessor Cheney-Lippold and the public 
statement from the most powerful 
U-M leaders was meant to warn cam-
pus faculty of the price for academic 
freedom, and potentially had a chilling 
effect on those who might otherwise 
speak out if they did not feel threatened. 
But the University wanted to make 
sure this wouldn’t happen again, so 

they convened a so-called Blue Ribbon 
Panel to devise a principle that would 
govern letters of recommendation.

The resulting policy is a strident 

attack on free speech. It doesn’t pro-
hibit instructors from denying letters 
of recommendation for political or eth-
ical reasons, but only from vocalizing 
those reasons. This did not sit well with 
GEO members, who voted overwhelm-
ingly to oppose the policy in our 2020 
contract negotiations. Much has been 
written about “the Palestine exception 
to free speech,” which describes the 
way norms of freedom of expression 
are so often bent to exclude those who 
would speak out for justice in Palestine. 
Despite the ongoing assault on Pales-
tinian lives and human rights, however, 
our problem with the University’s poli-
cy on letters of recommendation is not 
just about Palestine. More and more, 
instructors are starting to see letters 
of recommendation as an important 
site of political opposition and learning. 
There is a growing movement among 
mathematicians to refuse to write let-

ters for privacy-violating surveillance 
organizations, like the National Securi-
ty Agency. There is also the longstand-
ing trend of declining recommendation 
requests for Teach for America appli-
cants. We can think of a whole host of 
objectionable organizations — Exxon-
Mobil, Raytheon, U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement or Marjorie 
Taylor-Greene’s congressional office 
— to which an instructor may want to 
vocally refuse to write letters of rec-
ommendation. Being able to voice the 
reason for denying a letter of recom-
mendation is a critical component of 
any boycott, and GEO is proud to stand 
against this indefensible policy.

GEO ultimately won a meeting with 

U-M administrators to discuss the 
policy and how it will be implemented. 
The discussion left us only with a clear-
er sense of how poorly thought-out 
and difficult to implement the policy 
is. While U-M administrators made 
repeated reference to fears of discrimi-
nation as justification for the policy, 
they were never able to explain how 

Teach for America applicants could 
be understood as a group that could be 
discriminated against. The argument 
that the policy was designed to pro-
tect students from discrimination fell 
apart as the administrators repeatedly 
told us that graduate student instruc-
tors could deny letters for any reason 
at all — just so long as we don’t vocal-
ize it. Indeed, the University policy as 
it stands practically gives license to 
instructors to discriminate against stu-
dents in denying letters of recommen-
dation, provided that they don’t say the 
quiet part out loud. 

Furthermore, while the University 

claims to be protecting students, the 
policy actually makes it more difficult 
for students to get letters of recom-
mendation.

n September 2020, Barton Gell-
man, staff writer at The Atlantic 
magazine, published an ominous 

piece titled “The Election That Could 
Break America.” In the article, Gell-
man, with the help of legal scholars 
and political scientists, broke down the 
ways in which incumbent President 
Donald Trump, aided by Republican 
loyalists, could potentially utilize the 
United States Constitution’s ambigui-
ties to subvert the results of the 2020 
election and sow chaos. Although the 
worst of Gellman’s predictions did 
not come to fruition, the election and 
its aftermath were a time of extreme 
instability which eventually culmi-
nated in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insur-
rection. As such, Gellman’s article 
provides a prescient look at the more 
mechanical aspects of a major issue 
which much of American society 
hasn’t seemed to fully internalize: the 
weakness of democracy. Ultimately, 
in order to protect democracy and its 
institutions going forward, Americans 
must first be willing to both recognize 
and confront the concerning, real pos-
sibility of democratic backsliding at 
home. 

The takeaway from both Gellman’s 

article and the 2020 election itself 
should not be that America survived its 
one potential run-in with authoritari-
anism, but rather that democracy itself 

desperately needs to be strengthened 
and protected. The Republican Party, 
now fully backing Trump and his “big 
lie” about the 2020 election, has devel-
oped an antidemocratic vengeance 
that American society, including the 
Democratic Party, is wholly unpre-
pared to contend with in the coming 
years. However, it doesn’t seem like 
Democrats in power have actually 
internalized the significance of either 
the situation itself or their unduly tepid 
response in a meaningful way.

Since reclaiming the Presidency 

and the Senate, Democrats have 
focused on passing popular bills, such 
as the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief 
bill, and worked to highlight the val-
ues of bipartisan legislation. While 
these approaches are, in and of them-
selves, both good strategies for poten-
tially winning over Republican voters, 
they miss a key point: Defeating an 
undemocratic movement purely via 
popular policies, as the Democrats 
have attempted to do thus far, is not a 
sustainable strategy. It doesn’t actu-
ally counter or limit the Republicans’ 
undemocratic approach, and therefore 
fails to secure the future of America’s 
democratic institutions (although the 
House has passed H.R. 1, it is exceed-
ingly unlikely to ever receive the neces-
sary support to pass in the Senate). 

However, the more fundamen-

tal problem is that truly protecting 
democracy and its institutions requires 
Americans to fully comprehend their 
ephemeral nature. Americans must 
recognize that the United States, like 
every other democracy on earth, is 
susceptible to backsliding, a process 
by which formerly-democratic institu-
tions slowly become increasingly less 
liberal. Unfortunately, America’s dem-
ocratic origin story (one which also 
glosses over many less inclusive parts 
of the country’s political history) can 
numb both politicians and citizens to 
the fact that democratic governance is 
not an unyielding constant, but rather 
something which must be consciously 
upheld and protected. 

Because of America’s long demo-

cratic history, it is easy to visualize 
democracy as a binary, with a simple 
divide between democratic countries 
like the United States (those with elec-
tions) and undemocratic ones (those 
without elections). However, the truth 
is that democracy is a complicated 
and nuanced system that exists along 
a continuum, and often has no clear 
or explicit boundaries. As backsliding 
across the world has recently shown, 
the erosion of democratic institutions 
is often akin to the fable of the boiling 
frog, who is slowly killed as the water 
in the pot gets continually hotter. Just 
as there is no temperature at which

For as long as I can remember, I 

have always been fat. For me, self-
love could never be a matter of 
“you’re not fat” or “it’s all in your 
head” because through my daily 
interactions with other people, 
I’m often reminded that others 
see me as fat even when they mean 
well and especially when they 
don’t. As such, I had no choice 
but to confront fatness itself and 
accept myself as I was. However, 
loving my body was much easier 
said than done, because fatphobia 
is so ingrained in society that 
unconscious 
bias 
is 
accepted 

as reasonable and almost never 
challenged.

When I was a young teenager, 

I sunk many hours into scrolling 

through 
Tumblr 
and 
my 

Instagram explore page (that 
exclusively consisted of reposts 
from Tumblr) in order to find some 
sort of inspiration to love myself. 
While I waded through a flood of 
posts, I saw countless variations of 
“you have to love yourself before 
you can love someone else.” At the 
time, I didn’t think critically about 
these statements. They promoted 
self-love, which I recognized as a 
good thing even if I didn’t really 
know what that was supposed 
to mean to me personally. Yet 
reading these quotes never left 
me feeling inspired to solve my 
internal problems. At the time, 
they all sounded as if they were 
trying harder to sound deep 
than to actually be insightful. 
None of them helped me reflect 
on my approach to self-love, or 

even define what self-love is. I 
was drowning in this ocean of 
insecurity, and all these vague 
quotes 
were 
like 
defective 

liferafts. Now that I’m revisiting 
these quotes, I’m honestly glad 
that I didn’t really pay attention 
to them before, because I think 
they’re not only unproductive but 
wrong. I know many people who 
do not love themselves but have 
developed healthy relationships; 
is their love invalid? If I have only 
ever given “fake” love, then what 
is “real” love? How can I love 
myself when I’ve apparently been 
doing it wrong for my whole life? 
The sentiment behind this quote 
may be pure, but its language is 
unproductive at best and harmful 
at worst. 

Several years later, I watched 

Lizzo’s NPR Tinydesk concert 

from 2019, and at the end of her 
performance she said, “If you can 
love me, you can love yourselves 
too.” Her wording sounded so 
similar to the numerous self-
love statements I’ve read before, 
but she inverts it. Her rhetoric 
doesn’t imply that an insecure 
person is devoid or incapable of 
love; love, rather, is just hiding 
inside of ourselves. She’s telling 
us that precisely because we have 
so much love for others, we have 
the capacity to extend that love to 
ourselves.

When I first saw Lizzo and 

started listening to her music, I 
greatly admired her because I was 
so insecure. Even though I didn’t 
discover her Tinydesk concert 
until rather recently, I think I 
coincidentally followed her advice 
anyway. Compared to other self-

love affirmations, I think Lizzo’s 
quote is the most productive and 
actionable. By identifying the 
things I love about other people, 
I could develop the same qualities 
for myself. Lizzo is gorgeous, and 
I realized that if I could see her 
for her beauty, I could see myself 
as beautiful too.

I’ve realized that self-love is not 

merely the absence of sadness, but 
rather an endless pursuit of fully 
actualized potential. While I may 
love myself on a physical level, I’m 
realizing that I could be working 
to improve my confidence in other 
areas of my life. However, I strive 
to improve, not because I hate my 
current self, but rather because I 
love myself and want to see myself 
achieve my full potential. I know 
that even if I’m not perfect, I am 
still worthy of love.

Every so often I hear about 

Hazaras 
in 
Afghanistan. 
I 

just did last week — it was 
mostly children who died. I 
remember how Khaled Hosseini 
so beautifully and eloquently 
painted 
a 
heartbreaking 

picture of the recent history of 
Afghanistan in his novel, “The 
Kite Runner.” To this, students 
at my high school analyzed 
questions such as, “Why did 
Hassan and Ammar get treated 
so differently?” and, “What was 
the basis of discrimination and 
subjection for Hassan and his 
family?” 

Every so often, I hear about 

a blast in Pakistan and, every 
so often, I meet a family friend 
whose uncle, cousin or sibling 
was killed in these blasts. Just 
yesterday, I found out about the 
Gilgit massacre of Shia Muslims: 
initiated over a difference in 
Eid dates. I stared blankly at my 
laptop screen wide-eyed, shocked 
at the abhorrent events and 
appalled that I just now heard 
of them. When thinking about 
the intra-religious persecution 
of Shias, especially in my home 
country of Pakistan, I think about 
my privilege to freely practice my 
Shiism here. But then I wonder: 

Is it really freedom when yes, I 
openly use a sajdiga for my daily 
prayer, but still have to hear the 
classic “Why do you pray on a 
rock” joke? Is it really freedom 
when I have to feign toleration 
upon hearing Sunni Muslims say, 
“We’re allowed to marry Jews 
and Christians, just not Shias”? 

Every so often when I hear the 

news, I turn to the only method 
of denoting solidarity in this 
day and age: Instagram social 
activism. This metric is by no 
means indicative of genuity, but 
it is telling enough in the sense 
that many Muslims will post 
about all social justice issues 
— only until it comes to Shias. 
Ironically, these are the same 
Muslims who retweet, “When 
it’s Muslims, the world is silent,” 
as though oppression is even a 
competition to begin with. For 
me as a Shia and my best friend as 
an Ahmadi, there’s another layer 
to that silence; when it is us, even 
fellow Muslims will be silent. 
The sense of solidarity that every 
so often arises among Muslims 
is always amazing to see, but a 
disquieting part of me feels like 
an outsider looking in, knowing 
that this same unity will never 
be granted to persecuted Muslim 
minorities.

Although 
these 
creeping 

realities often surface, being in a 
subgroup affords one the clarity 
of noting not only hypocrisy, but 

logical 
inconsistencies. 
When 

you exist at the intersection of 
multiple identities, it becomes 
almost 
a 
habit 
to 
attempt 

mentally checking off the boxes 
when evaluating the validity 
of activism: If advocating for 
women’s rights, does it only center 
white women? If uplifting Muslim 
perspectives, 
is 
it 
complicit 

in silencing Shia and Ahmadi 
voices? On the other hand, while 
minority 
communities 
focus 

on 
marginalized 
voices 
that 

are buried under these grander 
narratives, they also dismiss 
overarching 
issues 
such 
as 

sexism and racism that still arise 
within these smaller spaces. Yet 
at the same time, every so often 
I’ll hear or read, “YOU CANNOT 
BE PROGRESSIVE WITHOUT 
SUPPORTING 
_____.” 
The 

text is right — claiming to be 
a progressive can’t stop where 
discomfort begins. It can’t stop 
at what was preached to you at 
a Friday night khutba or who 
your parents told you were kafir. 
Muslim activism must push itself 
beyond the bounds of looking 
outwards. Sooner or later, our 
“one ummah,” one community, 
must begin looking inwards, 
where so frequently, we commit 
the same acts of abhorrent 
oppression against each other 
that we lament are inflicted onto 
us.

This brings me to the tragedy 

of Aya Hachem that occurred 
in the spring of 2020. In what 
was likely to have been a hate 
crime, Aya was shot in the chest 
and died at only 19 years old, 
only one year into law school. 
Immediately, 
graphics 
were 

sprawled 
throughout 
social 

media and donation links were 
shared once news of the event 
travelled. Then, a halt. In a 
series of anxiety-riddled tweets, 
Twitter 
user 
@humbleakh1 

wrote, “I didn’t know she was a 
Shia… no way do I want to be in 
a situation where all this cause 
could go against me on the Day of 
Judgement.” The online Muslim 
community had found out that 
Aya was not merely Muslim, but 
Shia Muslim, and that modifier 

changed everything. Donations 
were rescinded and fundraisers 
were frozen — the predominantly 
Sunni Muslims organizing and 
donating wanted to rid their 
hands of connections to the 
Shia rafidis, “rejectors.” After 
observing this discourse, I turned 
to hear the thoughts of my own 
Sunni friends, expecting a similar 
sense of the seething anger I 
had. In response, I got either 
radio silence or the occasional 
“Yeah, that really sucks.” It felt 
like screaming into an abyss that 
would awkwardly shuffle at my 
volume, uncomfortable probably 
more at its own complicity rather 
than the situation at hand.

disappointment. Be careful to 
communicate clearly. On May 
28 the Moon enters Capricorn, 
which can motivate us to be very 
productive and work tirelessly 
toward our success.

Mercury begins its dreaded 

retrograde cycle on May 29, 
and it will exit its retrograde 
phase on June 22. Mercury is 
currently in Gemini, whose 
flippant nature indicates that 

each sign will need to face 
many changes at the same time. 
Remain flexible in order to 
transform Mercury retrograde’s 
challenges into opportunities. 
On the same day, Mercury 
forms a conjunction with Venus, 
which brings cheerfulness and 
lighthearted merriment.

The Moon enters Aquarius 

on May 30, which encourages 
us to think of new ideas, revise 
our usual routines and interact 
with others. The week closes 
on a high note with Mars 
forming a trine with Neptune, 
which boosts our creativity 
and energizes us for the week 
ahead.

It was jean shorts and a 

cropped 
tank 
top, 
probably 

because we were in the middle of 
a hot summer, and it was a cute 
outfit that let them stay cool. 
Crowds of girls walked around 
campus wearing similar outfits. 
I didn’t see any problem with 
it, but the people around me 
sure did, and so did Instagram 
and Twitter. Pictures of groups 
of girls circulated throughout 
Barstool’s 
Instagram 
with 

“copy and paste” being a go-to 
phrase in the comment section, 
ironically 
pointing 
out 
their 

“lack of originality.” Their outfit 
became the symbol of “basic,” a 
term commonly used as another 
way to shame women for almost 
everything they do, when in 
reality, it’s just a popular form of 
individuality. 

When I think of individuality, 

I think of a spectrum. On the 
extreme 
left, 
we 
have 
the 

individuality complexes, where 
every decision we make revolves 
around 
being 
different 
and 

standing out from the people 
around us. On the extreme right, 
we have the opposite, where we 
deny ourselves from any ounce of 
individuality to simply fit in with 
the crowd. In my experience, we 
all have to dabble on both sides 
of the spectrum before actually 
finding ourselves in the middle.

For most of middle school, I 

planted myself on the left side 
of the spectrum. Walking into 

school every day with dark blue 
basketball shorts and a dry-fit 
T-shirt made me feel like I was 
different, playing into the “not 
like other girls” trope. This 
trope centers around — and 
against — society’s description of 
“basic” women as unintelligent, 
uninteresting, 
talentless 
and 

superficial in order to portray 
them as inferior to men. It forces 
many women to try to prove 
themselves as worthy and further 
distance themselves from the 
“basic” girl stereotype put upon 
them. Falling into a spiral of 
trying to prove myself, I rejected 
pop music, hated makeup and 
the color pink and fixated on 
sports. There’s nothing actually 
wrong with hating or liking these 
things, but this persona I adapted 
by following the “not like other 
girls” trope felt constricting. I 
lost touch with the real me.

My box of earrings sat in the 

corner of my room untouched. The 
piercings on my ears closed up for 
the first time since I was a baby. 
My collection of nail polish was 
quickly thrown into the trash, all 
because I did not want to fit into 
the “stereotypical girl” who liked 
pink and jewelry and dresses. 
But the clothes I wore to break 
away from the stereotypes did 
not represent me. I simply played 
into them to stand out. I was not 
the tomboy that I tried to present 
myself as, and I felt trapped and 
constricted playing into this “not 
like other girls” cliché. By the 
time eighth grade rolled around, 
I got tired and felt unhappy 
with having to avoid the “girly” 
things I secretly liked for so long. 

During this time, I started letting 
new people into my life that 
drastically changed my lifestyle; 
our weekends were filled with 
movie marathons of every “chick 
flick” that we could think of. My 
friends would talk about them 
for hours after we watched, 
highlighting 
everything 
they 

loved and hated about the movies. 
In every movie we watched, they 
picked apart the hidden sexism 
behind the characters and the 
plot — the “not like other girls” 
trope. Before this, I had never 
even acknowledged the trope’s 
existence, yet I unknowingly 
went along with it. I quickly grew 
to be embarrassed for acting 
differently just for the sake of 
being different and playing into 
a misogynistic cliché. To get past 
this phase, I pushed myself to the 
right, but way too far.

Throughout the rest of middle 

school, and even a large portion 
of high school, I stayed on the 
right side of the spectrum. 
“through the late night” by 
Travis Scott would blare through 
my headphones while walking to 
class, as I would adjust my hair 
riddled with heat damage from 
straightening my natural curls. 
Leggings and a plain or floral 
top, sometimes a little cropped. 
White Adidas sneakers instead of 
Air Force Ones only because the 
latter were always sold out. And 
don’t get me wrong, the outfits 
were cute, but other than the 
cushy sneakers, it wasn’t me. I 
dressed like everyone else, used 
the same slang and listened to 
the same music — even though 
I hated what I had become. If 

everyone blended in, why would I 
break the pattern? If I broke the 
pattern, I felt like I would be seen 
as the same person I was, wearing 
those oversized basketball shorts 
just to be perceived as different 
from the rest. But in reality, 
trying to conform made me the 
same person I desperately tried 
to get away from, but this time in 
leggings. 

A repetitive sequence of left 

and rights followed, from strictly 
alternative music and movies, to 
exclusively pop, and then right 
back to indie and arthouse. It 
was 
only 
during 
quarantine 

that I was forced to focus only 
on myself. When schools closed 
and I wasn’t able to see others, 
I was eventually able to stop 
comparing myself to my peers 
and get a remote sense of who I 
am. But while social interactions 
decreased, the use of social 
media quickly replaced it causing 
setbacks. The continuous use 
of social media only pushed me 
further away from discovering 
myself due to the constantly 
changing trends displayed on 
TikTok and Instagram. Platforms 
like Pinterest are often used to 
show different style aesthetics. 
While this can be helpful as 
inspiration 
while 
concocting 

your own style, the pressure 
to conform leads to relying 
too heavily on the application, 
resulting in people recreating 
the exact looks without adding 
any personal touch. Limiting 
my interactions with the app 
and other social media, as well 
as peers, pushed me to find my 
own style, since there was no 
one to compare myself to. It gave 
me a balance between the two 
polarizing sides: conformity and 
explicit individuality. 

Being in the middle of the 

spectrum does not mean you’ve 
found a balance between being 

“unique” and “basic.” It simply 
means that the way you dress and 
act represents you. The middle 
means you stray away from 
trying to fulfill the “not like other 
girls” view, but at the same time 
you are not overcompensating to 
conform. You act the way you do 
because that is who you are and 
the way you express yourself, not 
because of how your peers act 
or don’t act. I, for one, classify 
myself as pretty “basic,” but it 
does not bother me the way it did 
before, because it is me. 

From childhood, we’ve been 

ingrained to believe being like 
a “stereotypical” woman was a 
bad thing through the movies we 
watch and the music we listen 
to. We’re insulted for acting too 
“basic,” or like other girls. But 
at the same time, we’re insulted 
for acting differently. Society 
uses the trope they created for 
us and turns it around to insult 
us. If a girl acts differently, she’s 
labeled as “trying too hard” and 
made fun of for being too quirky 
or weird. Unfortunately, some 
men and women will shame 
you with the very phrase they 
complimented you with minutes 
earlier, commenting “not like 
other girls” as an insult. At 
this point, it seems like there is 
not a single thing a girl can do 
without facing any backlash from 
society. It’s not only insulting 
but also hypocritical since men 
are not held to the same exact 
standard. In many instances, 
men “lack originality” in the 
same way women do. They post 
the same fishing pictures, listen 
exclusively to the same rap 
artists and wear the same Guess 
shirt that was once the pinnacle 
of male fashion. Yet, “basic” is 
still mostly used toward and 
against girls. 

Where are you on the individuality spectrum?

‘Shadow and Bone’ is the fantasy show we’ve been waiting for

Courtesy of ‘Shadow and Bone’

There’s something so delightful 

about the fantasy genre when it’s 
done right. Maybe it’s the inner 
child in all of us that appreciates 
the mysticism and imagination 
that fuels every fantasy story, 
or perhaps it’s the adult in us 
that needs to fully escape our 
responsibilities for an hour or 
two. Regardless of the reason, the 
fantasy genre has cemented itself 
as a mainstay of popular culture 
over the years, which should come 
as no surprise. Fantasy excites 
our imaginations like no other 
genre through its characteristic 
immersive 
worldbuilding 
and 

vibrant characters. A feature of this 
immersiveness is fantasy’s ability 
to make us question the conflicts 
and norms of our own world. 
Because media within the fantasy 
genre must build a reality from the 
ground up, oftentimes designing an 
entirely different social paradigm as 
well, thoughtfully created fantasy 
stories serve as the perfect stage for 
social commentary. Enter “Shadow 
and Bone,” Netflix’s latest fantasy 
series based on the Grishaverse, the 
universe developed by author Leigh 
Bardugo in her Shadow and Bone 
trilogy and Six of Crows duology. 

“Shadow and Bone” combines 

the narratives from the two book 

series, resulting in a thoroughly 
varied set of plots that culminates 
into a single, compelling story 
set in a fascinating universe. The 
Grishaverse includes a variety of 
ethnic and tribal divisions based 
upon regional distinctions, but the 
primary division in the universe 
is the one between Grisha, or 
individuals born with magical 
abilities, and non-Grisha in the 
country of Ravka. Non-Grisha view 
Grisha as witches and sorcerers 
meant to spread evil and abuse 
their power, while Grisha view 
non-Grisha as an oppressive enemy 
that seeks to exterminate them. 
Ravka is divided by the Fold, a mass 
of darkness and monsters which 
makes it nearly impossible to travel 
between the separated regions. 

This setup does a number of 

things. First, it establishes a division 
between distinct groups of people 
who have no control over how they 
are born. In addition, the existence 
of The Fold provides a concrete 
obstacle to overcome, as a literal 
embodiment of division. The story’s 
primary protagonist is Alina (Jessie 
Mei Li, “All About Eve”), who was 
orphaned at a young age when her 
parents were killed attempting to 
cross The Fold. Alina is a nobody, 
orphaned and ostracized for her 
Shu ancestry, which is seen as a 
national enemy to Ravka. Alina’s 
predicament sets the tone for 
the 
series, 
wherein 
seemingly 

powerless individuals are required 
to tackle systemic structures and 
obstacles in order to preserve 
their world’s wellbeing. During 
this process, Alina transforms 
from a somewhat naive, self-
doubting character to one capable 
of recognizing manipulation and 
abuse. Eventually, Alina learns 
to stand up for herself, driven by 
her increasing confidence in her 
abilities and moral discernment. 

On 
top 
of 
its 
character 

development, one of the best 
parts of the series is how it plays 
around with the concept of love, 
going against our understanding 
of the divisions between familial, 
romantic, 
and 
platonic 
love, 

opting instead for an ambiguous 
depiction. The heart of the show is 
the relationship between Alina and 
Mal (Archie Renaux, “Morbius”), 
who share a bond from their 
beginnings in the same orphanage. 
Through the letters they write to 
each other when they are separated 
for the first time, we come to 
understand everything the two 
have left unspoken during their 
relationship. It becomes clear that 
they are devoted to each other in 
a way that goes beyond traditional 
relationship definitions. 

Similarly, 
the 
relationship 

between characters Kaz (Freddy 
Carter, “Pennyworth”) and Inej 
(Amita Suman, “Doctor Who”) 
is also profoundly supportive in 

a way that goes beyond a defined 
relationship, 
as 
they 
protect 

each other unconditionally. Kaz 
is a hustler of sorts who owns 
a gambling club, while Inej is a 
woman talented in combat who 
was sold into servitude as a child. 
Not quite a romance, but not quite 
friendship either, their relationship 
begins with an alliance meant to 
benefit both of them. This develops 
into Kaz helping Inej fight for her 
freedom from slavery, no matter 
the cost. Ultimately, the motivation 
behind their support of one another 
isn’t for any personal profit, but 
simply because it seems inherently 
right. It’s powerful, it’s human and 
it reads as love in the rawest form. 

It should also be noted that the 

relationship between Kaz and Inej 
is from the Six of Crows duology, 
while the relationship between 
Alina and Mal is from the Shadow 
and Bone trilogy. The combination 
of sources creates a strong narrative 
parallel we otherwise wouldn’t 
have gotten from the books alone.

Much in the same way the 

show benefits from its multitude 
of compelling relationships, the 
series also benefits from its diverse 
casting and welcome inclusion of 
people of color. Many series destroy 
nuance by featuring a single 
character of a given race because, 
consciously or not, the series asserts 
that character as a representative 
of their race, preventing them 

from fully acting as an individual. 
“Shadow and Bone” isn’t perfect 
by any means, but in casting a 
multitude of racial backgrounds 
and lending its diverse characters 
genuine personality and strengths, 
the show achieves true realism and 
nuance.

Given all of this, why is “Shadow 

and Bone” a series that we need 
opposed to just another series 
we might enjoy? It boils down to 
the complexity of characters and 
storytelling the series manages to 
fit within a followable framework. 
Season 1 has eight 1-hour episodes 
— a totally manageable amount 
of content to consume — and yet 
it tackles so many interesting 
concepts 
and 
side 
plots 
and 

emotions. The major prerogative 
of 
dismantling 
division 
and 

quelling conflict is clear, and yet 
the series makes sure to highlight 
how complicated and unwieldy 
asserting widespread change really 
is. Currently, we’re in a world 
that is more tuned into injustice, 
inequity and political strife than 
ever, and it’s tough to find oneself 
as an individual amidst so many 
daunting problems. But does that 
mean we shouldn’t try? If we are 
anything like Alina, or the other 
characters in “Shadow and Bone,” 
the answer is a resounding no, 
which is ultimately why “Shadow 
and Bone” is absolutely worth the 
watch.

On the first day of my 10th-grade 

American Literature class, as an 
introduction to the quintessential 
high-school-English-class 
novel 

“The Great Gatsby,” we learned 
about the ever-present American 
dream, or the belief that anyone can 
make it in the United States if they 
just work hard enough. To my then 
15-year-old self, the critique of the 
American dream was foreign; my 
parents, who emigrated from India, 
are patriots who firmly believe in this 
social ideal. Thus, I was thoroughly 
intrigued by “Gold Diggers,” a 2021 
magical realism novel written by 
Sanjena Sathian that portrays second-
generation, Indian American youth 
willing to do whatever it takes to 
become successful. Sathian mixes 
magical realism, historical fiction and 
satire to deliver a truthful critique of 
the (Indian) American dream idolized 
by many immigrants in the late 20th 
and early 21st century.

“Gold 
Diggers” 
follows 
Neil 

Narayan, a boy crushed by societal 
expectations deeply infatuated with 
his driven neighbor, Anita Dayal. The 
novel is divided into two parts. The 

first, set in Bush-era Atlanta suburbs, 
details Neil and Anita through high 
school, where Neil struggles in his 
classes until discovering Anita’s secret 
to success: alchemy. Anita and her 
mother steal gold to brew lemonade 
that “harnesses the ambition” of the 
owner. Neil, desperate to fit into his 
community’s ideals, begins to down 
the lemonade in copious quantities 
until his actions cause tragedy to 
strike. The second part is set ten years 
later in Silicon Valley, where most of 
his peers have migrated. He reunites 
with Anita to pull off “one last heist.”

I made the mistake of starting 

(and finishing) the book during 
finals, reading it in a single sitting. 
The book bends literary conventions. 
It’s difficult to find books that can 
be incredibly entertaining while 
seriously pondering deep questions. 
It’s difficult to find books that capture 
the ambition taught from a young age 
within Indian American communities 
without 
dehumanizing 
Indian 

Americans into literal manifestations 
of the model minority myth as socially 
inept, clout-chasing side characters 
that lack inner worlds. It’s difficult 
to find books that bend genres like 
magical realism, historical fiction 
and satire in a way that is complex in 
its undertaking yet is still accessible. 

The deeply talented and witty Sathian 
effortlessly pulls it off, creating a 
masterpiece of a novel that questions 
the ambition of Indian Americans and 
their place in American history.

Sathian details the life of a 

community 
just 
outside 
“the 

perimeter” of Atlanta and American 
society. The community, like so many 
others, believes that if they keep their 
heads down and work, success is 
inevitable. They’re often berated for 
fooling around — in Neil’s mother’s 
view, this might “include anything 
from neglecting to take up AP Biology 
to shooting up hard drugs.” Children, 
pushed by their parents, try to uphold 
cultural expectations while surviving 
in a society they feel unaccustomed 
to. Some with seemingly effortless 
abilities, like Anita, breeze through 
high school, while others like Neil 
struggle. Neil, initially annoyed with 
his “lack of intellect,” realizes that the 
success around him isn’t effortless, 
and is in fact just the opposite: Aside 
from working ample amounts, Anita 
has resources, like her lemonade. 
Similarly, the American dream is 
never solely based on hard work 
or merit because often those who 
succeed already have the upper hand.

Sathian also focuses on the place 

of Indian Americans in American 

history; Neil, as a high school student, 
discovers the story of an Indian man 
in the California Gold Rush. As a 
graduate student studying history at 
the University of California, Berkeley, 
he becomes obsessed with finding 
the man, his “Bombayan gold digger,” 
who was ostracized and later lynched. 
The book focuses on how many 
Indian Americans weren’t viewed as 
American despite their ambition and 
participation within communities. 
No matter how hard the characters 
strive for the American dream, they 
continually 
struggle 
financially, 

emotionally 
and, 
eventually, 

physically. Their Indian American 
community constantly pushes the 
narrative of the dream, and Neil and 
Anita work like hell for it, hopped up 
on lemonade (and, sometimes, coke). 
Still, their solidified place “within 
the perimeter” of the American 
dream always seems just out of reach. 
Sathian uses Neil’s “everyman” 
character to indicate how stifling the 
myth of the American dream can be.

That’s not to say Neil is devoid 

of personality — the lengths that 
Neil goes to maintain the illusion of 
the community ideal of success are 
frightening. Neil is selfish, oblivious 
and 
insecure. 
Academically, 
by 

his community’s standards, he’s 

considered 
shockingly 
mediocre 

(which is an experience that I am 
not unfamiliar with). He’s a jerk 
and also one of the most realistic 
characters I’ve encountered in fiction. 
He constantly compares himself to 
Shruti, a girl who he ridicules but is 
jealous of, calling her “discomfiting” 
and “embarrassing.” Her refusal to 
adhere to the American social, beauty 
and femininity standards of the early 
2000s annoy others, especially Neil, 
and thus, he uses her as a scapegoat 
to vent his frustrations with Indian 
culture. In order to pursue the dream, 
Neil engages in petty, selfish high 
school drama with Shruti, which leads 
to an extremely devastating calamity 
when mixed with supernatural forces. 
Sathian details horrors and truths too 
often swept under the rug in pursuing 
the American dream, indicating just 
how much of a toll the ideal can exert.

Many were deeply impressed 

with the novel; Ann Arbor’s local 
Literati Bookstore hosted an event 
with Sathian, which was organized 
by 
Sarah 
Thankam 
Matthews. 

Additionally, the book is being 
adapted into television by Mindy 
Kaling’s production company, Kaling 
International. 

Taylor Swift’s re-recordings: reflection, nostalgia and deja-vu

I was only eight years old when 

Taylor Swift first released Fearless. 
At the time, Swift and her songs about 
heartbreak were too mature for my 
childhood self who still adamantly 
believed that boys had cooties. 
As some of my childhood heroes 
outgrew their roles — Miley Cyrus 
hanging up Hannah Montana and 
the devastating breakup of the Jonas 
Brothers — I found myself gravitating 
toward Swift and her lovable country 
sweetheart persona. Even though I 
didn’t know what love was or what 
it was like to have my heart broken, 
I clung to Swift and vicariously lived 
my perception of high school through 
her music. Fourteen years later, 
Swift’s re-release of Fearless has 
taken on an entirely new meaning, 
now that I’ve lived through many of 
the triumphant and tragic love stories 
that were completely unrelatable for 
me as a kid. 

Listening to the re-release of 

“Fifteen” has shown me how much 
I’ve grown since the album’s first 
version. The song was one of my 
favorites at 8 years old, allowing me 
to imagine what it would be like to 
date “the boy on the football team.” 
Now at 21, I know what it’s like to fall 
in love with the captain of a sports 
team and have my heart broken. 
As an adult, I wish I could tell my 
younger self that yes, the magic in 
“Fifteen” is real, but the line “Wish 
you could go back / And tell yourself 
what you know now” is the backbone 
of this story. While my younger self 
clung to the excitement of love and 
the anticipation of school dances and 
dating in high school, as an adult I 
cling to the hard truth that young love 
is fleeting. I see now that, as you age, 
you discover that it’s more important 
to develop yourself than to rest all of 
your hope in one person. 

While songs like “Fifteen” remind 

me of how much older I am and 
how much life I’ve lived since the 
first release of Fearless, other tracks 

like “You Belong With Me” are still 
timeless classics that transport me 
back to my childhood. Since the 
re-release of Fearless, my sister and 
I have spent many car rides blasting 
the album, belting the lyrics we’ve 
known by heart for over a decade. It’s 
when I’m singing “You Belong with 
Me” with my sister or hearing “The 
Way I Loved You” at the store that 
I experience a strange familiarity 
to when we were kids singing 
tracks from Fearless on our karaoke 
machine, pretending we knew what 
Swift meant when she says that love 
is “a roller coaster kind of rush.”

Perhaps this is one of the strangest 

phenomena of Swift’s re-recordings: 
their suspension of time. My first 
time listening to the re-recordings 
felt a lot like the first time I listened to 
the original album, and even though I 
knew what songs to expect, there was 
still a familiar sense of excitement and 
wonder as each track faded into the 
next. In fact, the way Swift mimics 
nearly all elements of the original 
recordings preserves a sacred time of 

my life. In many ways, the album is a 
space to reflect and recognize where 
I’ve been and how far I’ve come.

While many of the conversations 

surrounding Fearless are centered 
on the question of artists’ rights 
and fairness in the music industry, 
there’s much more at play here 
than Swift reclaiming the rights to 

her work. Like her fans, I’m sure 
Swift experienced the same sort of 
nostalgia as she recreated the music 
that defined her as a teenager; this 
album has undoubtedly taken on an 
entirely new meaning for her as an 
artist.

STATEMENT

Town or gown: the two sides of Ann Arbor

Painting the rock at the corner 

of Hill Street and Washtenaw 
Avenue is much more than just a 
longstanding campus tradition. 

In 1953, Michigan students and 

their Michigan State counterparts 
began vandalizing each other’s 
campuses with paint the week 
before a rivalry football game, a 
tradition that escalated to student 
arrests and suspensions. While 
the vandalism subsided on campus, 
the Spartans tried to get the final 
word, painting “M.S.U.” on the side 
of a limestone boulder in an Ann 
Arbor park sometime in the late 
1950s. The tradition of “Painting 
the Rock” persists at both schools 
today. Almost every time I drive 
down Washtenaw, the Rock looks 
different after a new student group 
or sports team has covered it with 
everything from “Go Blue”s to 
students’ names to political slogans.

But the Rock had a life long 

before the 1950s. If you were to 
scrape off the hundreds — maybe 
thousands — of layers of paint, you’d 
find a copper plaque depicting 
the stone’s original purpose: “To 
George Washington this memorial 
erected in celebration of the two 
hundredth anniversary of his birth, 
1932.” For years after the painting 
began, there was a push to preserve 
the monument’s integrity with a 

sign erected as recently as the 1970s 
begging people not to paint the 
memorial, but the tradition was too 
cemented in campus culture to be 
shut down. 

For at least some residents in 

the area, the Rock represents a 
lot more harm than good. Despite 
its co-optation by the University 
community, 
the 
Rock 
sits 
in 

George Washington Park, on city 
property. For Lauren (whose name 
has been changed due to her fear 
of retribution to her business by 
University clients), a born and 
raised Ann Arbor resident, the 
rock is the perfect depiction of the 
University’s relationship to the 
broader community. 

Lauren expressed her frustration 

to me in a recent phone call. She’s 
one of several local residents who 
have complained about the littering 
of paint buckets or concerns of 
toxins getting into the gutter. In 
2016, Nehama Glogower, another 
resident, wrote an article for the 
Ann Arbor Observer about her 
experience slipping in wet paint 
on 
the 
surrounding 
sidewalk. 

According to the women in both 
cases, they were unable to get their 
concerns heard.

“(Residents) 
resent 
(the 

University’s) entitlement,” Lauren 
said. “Where (the students are) a 

transient population, they don’t 
have 
a 
sense 
of 
placemaking 

because this isn’t their permanent 
home. And the University sort of 
allows that for their brand, and they 
don’t have a sense of collaboration.”

Colin 
Smith, 
Parks 
and 

Recreation Services Manager for the 
City of Ann Arbor, gets occasional 
complaints about the park, mostly 
when paint gets on the sidewalk or 
beyond. He said his department has 
to maintain the park at least twice 
a year, which he estimates costs 
about $500-$750 per visit when 
accounting for the materials needed 
to repaint the sidewalk and the 
labor. However, Michael Rein, U-M 
director of community relations, 
said he has never heard complaints 
about the Rock.

What is remarkable about the 

history of tension between the 
University and the town is how 
seldom it is addressed. Ann Arbor 
is constantly ranked among the top 
college towns in the country and is 
considered one of the University’s 
biggest assets. The school is so 
intertwined with the surrounding 
area — geographically, culturally 
and economically — that town 
and gown problems can seem 
nonexistent.

Ann Arbor was founded in 

1824 by John Allen and Elisha 

W. Rumsey. The two men headed 
west from Detroit in January of 
that year and reached what is now 
present-day Ann Arbor by early 
February. The pair purchased a 
collective 2.6 square kilometers of 
land for $800 (what would be about 
$22,000 today) and opened up 
the Washtenaw Coffee House, the 
town’s first structure. Ann Arbor 
— named in honor of Rumsey and 
Allen’s wives, both named Ann — 
started to expand as an agricultural 
trading center. 

The University of Michigan, 

which had been founded in Detroit 
in 1817, relocated to Ann Arbor in 
1839 while both school and town 
were in their infancy. Less than 20 
years after its founding, the city had 
a population of 2,000, a courthouse, 
a jail, a bank, four churches and 
two mills. The University was even 
smaller. During its first year in the 
new town, the University had just 
seven students and two professors. 
Now, the city’s population stands 
at over 120,000, and the school’s 
total enrollment is over 44,700. 
Michigan and Ann Arbor have 
grown, simultaneously, but not 
necessarily together. 

While most state constitutions 

give state legislatures power to 
provide 
for 
higher 
education, 

Michigan is one of the few that 

mentions 
specific 
institutions 

and enumerates specific forms of 
governance and autonomy. Most 
states’ public higher education 
systems 
are 
controlled 
by 
a 

governing board, while Michigan’s 
15 universities are independent 
schools. Each has their own school 
board that generally supervises the 
university’s actions and controls 
its finances. The governing bodies 
of 
Michigan’s 
three 
flagship 

institutions — the University of 
Michigan, Michigan State and 
Wayne State — are given almost 
complete 
autonomy 
over 
the 

universities’ operations. This has a 
number of implications, one being 
that the University isn’t bound by 
the Ann Arbor local government 
in nearly any form — it doesn’t pay 
taxes or follow the same zoning 
regulations — which, naturally, 
can cause some town and gown 
problems.

“The University doesn’t need to 

follow any of our rules,” Ann Arbor 
Mayor Christopher Taylor said. 
“They don’t follow our zoning; they 
don’t follow our planning. And, of 
course, they have the resources to 
do what they want when they want 
to do it.”

The art of the roommate pitch 

It was a match made on 

Facebook. My roommate Maggie 
and I found each other on the Class 
of 2022 page and immediately 
clicked because we had so much 
in common. We had both taken 
gap years. We shared a bedtime 
(11pm to 1am), diet (vegetarian) 
and cleanliness level (we let clutter 
build up when we were busy). We 
were both training for our first 
marathon. We both came from 
small, religious communities in 
the Midwest. We had seven-year-
old brothers. She seemed warm 
and worldly, like the type of girl 
you meet in college. She felt — 
through a screen — perversely 
familiar. She seemed safe. If 
you can choose a great person 
like Maggie, I thought, why risk 
getting stuck with someone who 
blasts Nickelback at 3 a.m., or 
microwaves fish, or leaves toenails 
on your bed, or eats all your snacks 
without bothering to wipe away 
the crumbs?

In the United States, it’s a 

suspense-filled rite of passage to 
move from a childhood bedroom 
to a stuffy 9’ by 6’ dormitory: a 
world of carpeted corridors, hall 
councils and lanyard-wearing RAs 
who exude hollow cheerfulness. 
Increasingly, freshman year of 
college is the first time students 
share a room, and after the 
infamous awkward photo in front 
of the bunk bed, roommates have 
the potential to make or break 
each other’s college experiences. 
Amidst the uncertainty of going 
to 
college, 
uprooted 
students 

fearfully cling to peers who seem 
familiar.

Roommate self-selection has 

risen in recent years. Starting 
around 
2010, 
Facebook 
has 

facilitated 
roommate-finding 

forums 
in 
which 
incoming 

students 
post 
blurbs 
about 

themselves 
and 
message 
the 

people who seem like compatible 
roommates. 

So, what do 18-year-olds say 

about themselves when they’re 
trying to find the Monica to their 
Rachel, the Owen Wilson to their 
Wes 
Anderson 
(they 
roomed 

together at UT Austin), the yin to 
their yang?

It’s not unlike dating apps. The 

posts follow a predictable pattern: 
market-friendly 
biographies, 

chirpy and casual, laden with 

“go blue!”s and “can’t wait”s and 
lists of carefully chosen favorites 
(not too obscure, not too basic). 
Excluding common words like 
“and” and “for,” the most-used 
word is “love.” Everyone is “super 
excited” and “pretty chill.” It’s 
as if one person in the class did 
the homework, and everyone else 
turned in a copy with a few words 
changed.

Integral 
to 
the 
post 
are 

articulated contradictions to the 
likes of ‘I love to go out but I also 
love to stay in’ or ‘I prioritize 
my studies but I also like to have 
fun’: statements so obvious that 
they become meaningless. You 
might as well say ‘I like to be 
awake sometimes but I also like to 
sleep.’ A form of the phrase, now 
crystallized as a cliche, shows up 
in about half of the posts. 

Sometimes, students establish 

individuality 
with 
careful 

divulgences— 
descriptions 

which are quirky enough to be 
memorable, safe enough to be cool 
and always positive. ‘I take an 
obscene amount of naps’ or ‘I am 
a bit of a sunset fanatic and love to 
watch them from a hammock’ or 
‘I’m also obsessed with 7-Eleven 
and Chipotle’ or ‘I have a lot of 
crystals (not meth).’

Certain types of people in these 

roommate 
marketplaces 
seem 

more likely to post than others. 
Students who choose to post on 
the Facebook page are not entirely 
representative 
of 
the 
entire 

incoming freshman class. About 
75% of posts are by females. In my 
opinion, self-described “foodies” 
seem 
grossly 
overrepresented, 

although I suppose I can’t prove 
it. Among those who have posted 
in the 2025Facebook group in the 
past two weeks (I tallied them 
up), the most common major/
career track, shared by 23% of all 
posters, is pre-med, followed by 

undeclared 
(15%), 
Engineering 

(14%) and Business (9%). Though 
the pre-med numbers seemed 
high to me, U-M advisor Julie 
Berson-Grand thinks the number 
sounds about right. In an email, 
she explained that the University 
of Michigan is “consistently in the 
top three of the number of medical 
school applications in the country.” 

I found myself fascinated by 

the odd art of the roommate 
marketplace post and eventually 
got so invested that I tried to 
recreate the posts with artificial 
intelligence. These blurbs are so 
formulaic that an AI model picked 
up on the script rapidly, hilariously. 
I used a number of resources 
including GPT-2 and TensorFlow, 
fed a few hundred posts into the 
AI model, and it quickly started 
spitting out examples based on 
what it had gleaned. The generated 
blurbs emulated the style enough 
to be somewhat believable, but 

they had a sort of chaotic humor 
that one would expect from a 
robot trying to find a roommate. 
Here’s one example: 

I 
(Gryffindor) 
have 
been 

partying all year and we decided 
to go out. There has been a lot 
of talk about basketball and 
basketball related dramas but 
I’m a big fan of Family Guy and 
Friends and Psych — unlike most 
people. My favorite shows are Big 
Bang Theory with greatest era, 
Psych and the office with greatest 
shows. I listen to a wide range of 
music and am very social. I can’t 
wait to go to all the football and 
basketball games and to watch the 
football and basketball teams play. 
I’m considering rushing but can’t 
wait to go to all the football and 
basketball games. My sister and 
I recently committed to LSA and 
will be studying either psychology 
or chemistry. I can’t wait to meet 
all the students and make friends! 
Please reach out to be besties and 
tell us something new! GO BLUE

Instagram – @kateslategamer
Snapchat – kateslategamer
The result had all the parts of a 

roommate post: expected college 
major, 
social 
media 
handles, 

hobbies, taste in movies and TV, 
current slang (‘please reach out to 
be besties’), a ‘GO BLUE’ and even 
their Harry Potter house! But it’s 
eerily, palpably out-of-touch, right 
from the first sentence. Other 
subtle failures are implying that 
Friends, one of the most popular 
TV shows of all time, is obscure 
and 
gushing 
about 
football 

and basketball in an obscenely 
repetitive manner. But some of the 
model’s other posts, while stilted, 
are a little more convincing: 

“Hello my name is Daniel and 

i’m from Michigan. I’m undecided 
with my major but will be doing 
something business related and 
probably apply research into the 
subject. I’m an avid reader, I’m a 
big movie guy and I enjoy lots of 
life activities, but I’m also kind of 
a night owl. I love going out and 
hanging with my friends and can’t 
wait to go to tailgates and football 
games, but I’m also down to go out 
and have fun. I’m hoping to study 
abroad in LSA before my med 
school”

Michigan shows it belongs In competitive debut, Michigan Adaptive 

Sports and Fitness sends a message

SEATTLE — No team had ever 

beaten Washington in a regional 
game it hosted since 1995. The 
Huskies were a perfect 52-0.

Yet there Michigan was in the 

bottom of the seventh, up 2-1, and 
just three outs away from being the 
first team to do so.

Alex Storako clearly was ready 

for the opportunity. 

Three outs later — and without 

throwing a single ball — the game 
was over. The Wolverines won, and 
in doing so, showed the NCAA that 
they belonged.

“We had to just play our game,” 

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
said. “And I’ve told them all week, 
you don’t have to be better than you 
are just play the game you know 
how to play, I really thought we did 
that.”

To understand the significance 

of this win you have to go back a 
week to Sunday night — the NCAA 
selection show. Many expected 
Michigan to get a top 16 spot and 
host a regional at Alumni Field this 
weekend.

That did not happen.
Instead, they were seeded 17th 

and were sent across the country 
to play in Seattle against the 16th 
seeded Huskies along with Seattle 
University and Portland State.

“(The 
selection 
committee) 

disrespected our entire conference,” 
Hutchins 
said 
to 
reporters 

immediately after the selection 
show on May 16th. “I’m not very 
pleased with it at all. Disrespect.”

But they still made the most of 

the hand they were dealt. 

After a Friday night win over the 

Seattle Redhawks, the Wolverines 

had their chance at Washington. 
And, 
well, 
you 
know 
what 

happened.

Their 2-1 victory clinched a 

spot in the Seattle regional final 
on Sunday. And with the Huskies 
ace Gabbie Plane having pitched 
nearly two full games already this 
weekend, and Michigan needing to 
only win one more game while any 
other team needs to win three, the 
Wolverines truly sit in the driver’s 
seat.

Michigan’s best performance 

came against its strongest test to 
date. In the final rankings before the 
NCAA selection show, the Huskies 
came in 6th. The Wolverines’ best 
opponent prior to Saturday’s game 

was Minnesota, who was ranked 
24th.

Again, Michigan showed that 

it should have belonged in the 
national 
conversation 
all year. 

The Wolverines showed that they 
deserved more respect. And they 
showed that they should’ve hosted 
a regional.

Because they didn’t just beat 

Washington while Plane was on 
the mound. Michigan controlled 
the game from the second inning 
all the way until Storako’s final 
pitch. The 2-1 scoreline wasn’t 
truly indicative of how the game 
went. Because while two solo 
home runs from senior infielders 
Lou Allan and Taylor Bump did 
provide the scoring for Michigan, 
it had multiple chances throughout 
the 
game 
to 
score 
as 
well, 

while Washington did not. The 
Wolverines had two runners reach 
third base throughout the game, 
the Huskies had zero. Michigan 
outhit Washington and Storako 
outpitched Plane. 

Collegiate 
wheelchair 
tennis 

has grown markedly in recent 
years. Since 2019, the number of 
participating schools and athletes at 
the annual Collegiate Wheelchair 
Tennis 
National 
Championships 

has more than doubled despite the 
hardships imposed by the pandemic. 

However, no program has yet 

come close to challenging the sport’s 
long-time 
heavyweights 
— 
the 

University of Arizona, San Diego 
State University, and the six-time 
champions University of Alabama. 

That is, until this year. 
Michigan was an enigma coming 

into this year’s Collegiate Wheelchair 
Tennis 
Nationals. 
People 
knew 

that the Wolverines were building 
something — word travels fast in the 
tight-knit adaptive sports community. 
But beyond graduate student and 
wheelchair tennis star Chris Kelley, 
the caliber of Michigan’s athletes 
was, for the most part, anyone’s guess. 

Shocking 
everyone, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
inexperience 
didn’t 

prove to be a barrier. Michigan 
 

traveled home with a fistful of finalist 
medals, even managing to give 
Alabama a run for its money in the 
team final.

Undoubtedly, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

performance on the court in its 
first ever competitive appearance 

was remarkable. More remarkable 
still, 
however, 
was 
Michigan’s 

performance off the court. 

Compared 
to 
the 
other 

participating 
schools, 
Michigan’s 

traveling entourage was enormous: 
the most athletes, two coaches, a 
physical therapist, and a host of 
supporting students. All were clad in 
a coordinated display of Wolverine 
pride, donning shirts, shorts, shoes 
embroidered 
with 
“Michigan 

Adaptive Sports and Fitness.” Even 
the spokes on the tires of the athletes’ 
wheelchairs were painted an eye-
catching maize. 

While this level of support and 

coordination at a major collegiate 
competition may strike the seasoned 
college athletics fan as standard 
or unexceptional, this is by no 
means the case for the majority of 
adaptive sports programs across 
the nation. Minimal funding and 
feeble institutional recognition is 
pervasive, stunting their growth. 
Only a few collegiate programs have 
thus far been successful in generating 
the support necessary to begin to 
resemble the average collegiate 
varsity sports team, and it’s taken 
them a long time. 

But this year, Michigan shattered 

that model. In the span of only two 
years, a combination of support 
from key institutional players and 
generous financial backing from the 
Adam Miller Memorial Fund, among 
others, has enabled the Wolverines 

to become a dominant force in the 
collegiate adaptive sports space in 
next to no time. 

“The support we’ve had — that’s 

why we had matching apparel and 
chairs,” Dr. Feranmi Okanlami, 
Director of Michigan’s Adaptive 
Sports and Fitness Program, said. 
“These might seem like superficial 
items, but they made every other 
program look and see that we’re a 
well-oiled machine with organized 
ideas — they brought an energy that 
made people know that Michigan 
was there.” 

Throughout the tournament, that 

energy was an attractive force. A 
significant number of passerby and 
Michigan alumni stopped by the 
Michigan contingent to inquire about 
the program and wheelchair tennis. A 
conversation between Okanlami and 
a hitting partner of former Michigan 
Men’s Varsity Tennis player and 
Wimbledon Finalist Mal Washington 
even led to a video of support from 
Washington himself. 

“People that were not initially 

part of this entourage became part 
of this entourage,” Okanlami said. 
“We had parents of athletes from 
other institutions come and sit 
with us because they were there by 
themselves — they gravitated to the 
Michigan contingent. I think that 
energy really attracted people and 
benefitted the competition.”

Michigan’s big win over Washington proved it belonged in the national 
conversation. 


Offense disappears in rubber game loss

Blown opportunity: Michigan falls short in NCAA Regional final, 

wasting talented senior class

The No. 24 Michigan baseball 

team entered the bottom of the 
ninth down by four runs — not 
an insurmountable deficit by the 
Wolverines’ standards. When 
slugger Griffin Mazur came to 
bat with one on and only one 
out, he needed just one good 
swing to put Michigan back in 
the game. 

Instead, the fifth-year catcher 

swung at the first pitch of the 
at-bat and produced a weak 
grounder to the left side. The 
Maryland infield handled it 
cleanly, turning a game-ending 
double play that secured its 
7-3 win over the Wolverines 
and 
mercifully 
ended 
one 

of 
Michigan’s 
most 
anemic 

offensive performances of the 
season. 

The Wolverines scored all 

their runs in the bottom of 
the second, when fifth-year 
shortstop Benjamin Sems and 
sophomore 
second 
baseman 

Ted Burton both hit safely and 
sophomore 
left 
fielder 
Tito 

Flores 
crushed 
a 
three-run 

homer. 

“After the three-run homer, 

I thought for sure we would 
just keep the scoring going,” 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
said. “But we didn’t have much 
going on offensively after the 
second inning outside of some 
lineouts and a few walks.”

Even during the productive 

second 
inning, 
Michigan’s 

hitters showed a crucial lack 
of discipline: Mazur struck out 
on three pitches and redshirt 
sophomore 
center 
fielder 

Jordon Rogers and sophomore 
designated hitter Joey Velazquez 
ended the inning with back-to-
back strikeouts. 

The Wolverines had another 

scoring 
opportunity 
in 
the 

third, when Sems batted with a 
runner on base. Sems got under 
the pitch from Terrapins’ starter 
Sean Burke and popped out in 
foul ground to end the inning, 
a rare occurrence for one of the 
team leaders in batting average 
and quality at-bat percentage.

Burke continued to dominate 

Michigan in the fourth and 
fifth and the Wolverines’ hitters 
didn’t 
make 
the 
necessary 

adjustments in their second 

and third at-bats against him. 
Burton struck out on three 
pitches and Mazur popped out 
in foul ground. Rogers and fifth-
year third baseman Christian 
Molfetta managed to work full 
counts before striking out, at 
least.

Sophomore right fielder Clark 

Elliott and Sems both made hard 
contact in the sixth, but the 
Maryland defense was perfectly 
positioned to make the play both 
times. 

“Maryland was pitching fine,” 

Bakich said. “Our fault for not 
making more hard contact, and 
the hard contact we made was 
caught.”

Michigan’s poor performance 

continued against the bullpen, 
which, like Burke, forced nearly 
every hitter into two-strike 
counts. Mazur struck out on 
three pitches again and Flores 
grounded into a double play. In 
the eighth, the Wolverines put 
two runners on for sophomore 
first baseman Jimmy Obertop 
but a breaking ball missed his bat 
for an inning-ending strikeout.

“We weren’t really able to 

string 
something 
together,” 

Elliott said. “We were taking 

good at-bats sporadically.”

Altogether, 
Michigan 

managed only four hits and 
three walks and struck out 11 
times. Molfetta, Mazur and 
Sems, typically three of the 
Wolverines’ 
best 
and 
most 

consistent hitters, went 1-for-11 
in their last home game.

“You’d like to see all the 

seniors hit home runs and have 
awesome days on senior day,” 
 

Bakich said.“But it seems like it 
never goes to script that way.”

Regionals are only two weeks 

away, and for Michigan to 
survive and advance, it will need 
to hold the strike zone, work 
deeper into at-bats and move 
runners around in stressful 
situations. 

Today isn’t the first time 

the 
offense 
has 
completely 

abandoned 
its 
successful 

approach in a rubber game, 
which doesn’t bode well for the 
pressure-packed games on the 
horizon.

SEATTLE — Michigan was up 

four. The lead was more runs than 
Washington had scored against the 
Wolverines in the past two games 
combined. There was an .88 ERA 
pitcher in the circle for Michigan 
and a pitcher who had just thrown a 
complete, seven-inning game on the 
rubber for the Huskies.

There was no reason to lose.
Then they blew it.
They bottled it, fumbled the 

bag, dropped the ball, shit the 
bed — however you want to put it, 
Michigan let an NCAA Regional 
victory fall through its hands. 

The Wolverines (38-8), who 

entered the day only needing one 
out of two games to advance to the 
Norman Super Regional, crumbled 
at the brink of triumph at the hands 
of Washington (45-12) by a score of 
10-5.

Michigan took the lead early. 

A Lexie Blair single opened up 
the game, and a bunt from senior 
infielder 
Natalia 
Rodriguez 

advanced the junior outfielder into 
scoring position.

Senior first baseman Lou Allan 

ripped a ball to center field in the 
next at-bat, scoring Blair. Standing 

up from her slide, Blair shouted 
towards the Michigan dugout and 
the team shouted back with just as 
much conviction.

After 
senior 
third 
baseman 

Taylor Bump drew a walk, a flyout 
advanced 
sophomore 
Audrey 

LeClair — pinch-running for Allan 

— to third. Sophomore designated 
player Lauren Esman stepped up to 
the plate. In three pitches, Esman 
was rung up.

“We made a couple of miscues,” 

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
said, “They got a little over-amped 
and over-anxious.”

In the bottom of the frame, 

Washington answered with a series 
of hits that resulted in a sacrifice fly 
scoring Klingler from third.

All tied up, the Wolverines struck 

again, this time more decisively. A 
flurry of well-worked counts and 
balls finding gaps saw Michigan 
with bases loaded. More small ball 
saw the Wolverines scoring four 
one-by-one.

In the bottom of the third, the 

Huskies found their own bases-
loaded opportunity. A two-RBI 
double by Kelley Lynch was all they 
could muster before ending the 
inning on a pop out and a strikeout.

Michigan still had a two-run 

lead. It was in the driver’s seat 
heading into the fourth despite the 

slip-up. Then it began to unravel.

Washington outfielder Jadelyn 

Allchin opened up the frame with 
a home run, cutting the deficit to 
one. Hutchins had seen enough, 
deciding to bring in senior left-
hander Meghan Beaubien for junior 
right-hander Alex Storako.

She didn’t fare any better.
Sophomore 
second 
baseman 

Julia Jimenez took her time on the 
throw and Washington’s Sis Bates 
beat it out. A Klingler double scored 
Bates, tying the game at five apiece.

A grounder back to second was 

thrown home, Jimenez trying to 
get the force out at the plate, but 
the runner beat the throw and the 
Huskies took their first lead of the 
game. A gap shot fell in shallow 
right-center field scoring another.

Then, a double from outfielder 

Madison Huskey scored two more, 
making it 9-5, Washington. A short 
bunt froze Bump on the decision 
and yet another run scored.

SEATTLE — Boos rang out in a 

cacophony from the Seattle University 
fans as centerfielder Bailey Thompson 
was rung out on a changeup that 
floated in and picked the bottom right 
corner of the zone.

From the press vantage point, 

nearly behind the plate, the pitch 
thrown by senior left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien was objectively a strike. 
So why the jeers from the Redhawk 
crowd? They haven’t seen a pitcher of 
this caliber since Washington’s Gabbie 
Plain on March 13, and it was clear 
neither had the Seattle players.

Leaving the game with no hits 

allowed and 12 strikeouts, Beaubien 
was lethal. She picked apart hitters 
with surgical precision, choosing 
her placement and offspeed pitches 
systematically and scientifically. 

“It’s a nice little pride thing,” 

Beaubien said. “It’s nice to throw that 
and say that no one got any hits on you 
that game.”

Meanwhile, the Redhawks looked 

flustered in nearly every at-bat, 
swinging at bad-opportunity pitches 

and watching good ones pass by them 
before turning around and heading 
back to the dugout. 

“I 
think 
a 
combination 
of 

everything I got was really going for 
me today,” Beaubien said. “That helps 
keep hitters off balance.”

When Seattle did make contact, 

they 
were 
typically 
groundouts 

handled well by the Wolverine 
infielders. 
Rarely, 
Michigan’s 

outfielders had to get under a deep ball 

to convert the out.

Despite the controlling pitching 

appearance, the start of the game 
foreshadowed a much shakier outing. 
On the third batter of the game, 
Beaubien accidentally launched a ball 
backwards from her windup, counting 
as a ball. She came back with another 
pitch that soared high. The third came 
inside, striking Thompson on the 
forearm and giving up the free base. 
The entire at-bat for Beaubien was 
shambolic.

Beaubien came back the very next 

batter to prove everyone wrong. It 
took seven pitches as Seattle first 
baseman Madison Catchcart fought 
off Beaubien’s assault, but in the end 
Beaubien won, ringing Catchcart up 
on a heater and sending the Redhawks 
back to their dugout empty handed.

For the rest of the game, she was 

as stout as can be, not a single sign 
of uncertainty peeking through her 
confident performance.

And with little support from her 

offense, Beaubien needed to. She 
willed her team to a 2-0 victory in the 
opening game of the NCAA Seattle 
Regional.

Michigan offense struggles in loss against Maryland

Sophomore 
infielder 
Jimmy 

Obertop swung right through a 
curveball, striking out and leaving 
two runners on base with the 
score 7-3 in the eighth inning. 
The Maryland bench erupted as 
Michigan’s first real chance to get 
back in the game disappeared.

The Wolverines (26-15 Big Ten) 

struggled on both sides of the plate 
as they fell to the Terrapins (26-15) 
on Sunday, 7-3.

Sophomore left-hander Jacob 

Denner started on the mound for 
Michigan, although it was a short 
start. He struggled early, allowing 
two home runs in the first inning 
as Maryland jumped out to a 3-0 
lead. Denner got through the 
second but allowed a double in the 
third and was pulled in favor of 
senior right-hander Blake Beers.

“When you face good hitting 

and you fall behind or you make 
mistakes out over the middle of 
the plate good hitters are gonna hit 

it,” Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
said. “They made us pay early in 
the game and we got down.”

Beers did not fare much better 

than Denner. He allowed an 
inherited runner to score, and then 
ran into trouble an inning later, 
allowing two runs and two more 
to reach base before he exited. 
Freshman 
left-hander 
Logan 

Wood took over and allowed one 
run to score but was able to induce 
a double play to end the inning 
with the score at 7-3. Wood got 
through 2.1 innings before leaving.

The back end of the bullpen did 

well, as graduate student right-
hander Joe Pace worked a clean 
1.1 innings in relief of Wood, and 
junior right-hander Willie Weiss 
finished off the game with two 
scoreless frames.

“Logan Ward and Joe Pace and 

Willie Weiss were able to land 
their secondary stuff at a much 
better rate than the first two guys 
were,” Bakich said. “They got 
ahead of hitters and had them off 
balance.”

But the damage was already 

done. The Michigan offense was 
dormant, putting up just three 
runs and four hits as the team 
struggled to muster up quality at 
bats.

“We didn’t have much going 

on offensively after the second 
inning,” Bakich said. “Credit to 
their pitching, they were pitching 
fine and it’s also our fault for not 
making more hard contact. The 
hard contact we made was caught.”

Sophomore 
outfielder 
Tito 

Flores got the Wolverines on the 
board in the second, crushing a 
three-run home run to the left 
after graduate transfer infielder 
Benjamin 
Sems 
singled 
and 

sophomore infielder Ted Burton 
doubled to level the score at three.

Those early hits turned out 

be three of the four total that 
Michigan lodged in the game

There 
was 
no 
late-inning 

magic today, as the eighth-inning 
opportunity ended with Obertop’s 
strikeout. In the ninth, a leadoff 
walk by Sems was erased by a 
Burton 
strikeout 
and 
Mazur 

grounding into a double play to 

end the game.

The 
explosive 
Wolverine 

offense struggled to produce and 
early 
pitching 
struggles 
gave 

Maryland 
an 
insurmountable 

lead and the series win. The loss 
eliminates Michigan from Big 
Ten title contention, as Nebraska 
clinched the title by moving 3.5 
games ahead of the Wolverines 

with a win today against Ohio 
State.

“It feels horrible,” sophomore 

outfielder 
Clark 
Elliott 
said. 

“Especially on senior day, not to 

mention the weight that it carried 
for the postseason, it leaves a sour 
taste in our mouth. You want to let 
the seniors go out on a win, but we 
just couldn’t get it done.”
