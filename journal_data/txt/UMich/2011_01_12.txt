Former Michigan

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Editor
After the worst three-year
stretchinthehistoryofthefootball
program, Athletic Director Dave
Brandon announced yesterday
that San Diego State coach Brady
Hoke will succeed Rich Rodriguez
as Michigan's head football coach.
Hoke will become the program's
19th coach in its 131-year history.
"We are pleased to announce
the hiring of Brady," Brandon
wrote in the press release. "He is
a terrific coach and will be a great
ambassador and leader for our
football program. We look forward
to having him build a champion-
ship program on the field and in
the classroom."

In the minutes after the Michi-

it had hired San Diego State's

Yes, Hoke is a Michigan Man.
He understands Michigan's
unique traditions. He was a
part of the coaching staff that
won a national chanpionship at
Michigan. That was certainly an
important part of this hire.
He's also a defensive-minded
coach - which is a sight for sore
eyes after watching Michigan's
defense the past three seasons.

a new beginning
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
It didn't take long for word to
spread across campus yesterday
that Brady Hoke would be the new
head coach of the Michigan foot-
ball team.
And while many are hoping for a
new era to be ushered in for Michi-
gan football with the new coach,

students interviewed after the
announcement had mixed feelings
about the decision.
Second-year Law School student
Raj Vashi said he wasn't impressed
with Hoke's record, and didn't
think Hoke would have been con-
sidered had he not previously been
an assistant coach at the University.
Hoke was an assistant coach for the
Michigan footballteam from 1995-
2002.

ASKING FOR ACCOMODATIONS
The accidental sociologist

Sociology lecturer PJ
McGann became involved in
her field on a whim.
"I took this intro sociology
class just for the hell of it. The
professor was boring, but the
material was intriguing," she
said.
Arriving at the University in
2001, McGann has taught sever-
al topics ranging from sexuality
and gender to deviance.
"At first I was a little nervous
to teach a 100-level course - I
hadn't done that since '95, but
then I realized that first-year
students have so much growth
in them and are so engaged. It's
a very rewarding experience,"
she said.
Like her classes, McGann's
research projects also span
many topics within the field.
Working with Rackham student
David Hutson, she is currently

in the final stages of completing
a book about the sociology of
medical diagnoses.
"The book about the sociol-
ogy of diagnosis is a brand new
book for a brand new field,"
McGann said. "What we hope
to do is set the initial terms of
the debate."
McGann is also working on
the Ponytails Project, a study
with the University of Southern
California regarding the image
and gender norms of female
student-athletes. Addition-
ally, she's writing a book about
tomboys titled, "The Ballfields
of Our Hearts: Tomboys, Femi-
ninity, and the Gendered Body,"
which is an original topic in the
area of study.
McGann said she hopes her
research will have a lasting
impact on the field of sociology
and that The Ponytails Project

can have an impact on athletic
policies concerning gender.
Concentrating in emergency
medical care and athletic train-
ing, McGann received a bach-
elor's degree and a master's
degree from Minnesota State
University. ShOe completed her
Ph.D. at Brandeis University.
McGann said her passion
for teaching stems from many
inspirations, including her edu-
cation.
"On a personal level, college
transformed me, and I love to
lea-n, so to me, loving teaching
is an extension of loving learn-
ing," McGann said. "On a more
social level, I truly believe that
education can be a force for
good in society. It is so reward-
ing to help a student reach that
'a ha' moment when they finally
understand a concept."

Religious crackdown results inI P
arrest of 70Christians inIran

Grass-roots 'hard-
liners' targeted by
authorities
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates
(AP) - Iran has arrested about
70 Christians since Christmas in
a crackdown that demonstrates
the limits of religious tolerance by
Islamic leaders who often boast
they provide room for other faiths.
The latest raids have targeted
grass-roots Christian groups Iran
describes as "hard-liners" who
pose a threat to the Islamic state.
Authorities increasingly view
them with suspicions that range
from trying to convert Muslims to
being possible footholds for for-
eign influence.
Christian activists claim their
Iranian brethren are being per-
secuted simply for worshipping
outside officially sanctioned main-
stream churches.
Caught in the middle is the small
community of Iranian Christians
who get together for prayer and
Bible readings in private residenc-
es and out of sight of authorities.
They are part of a wider "house
church" movement that has taken
root in other places with tight con-
trols on Christian activities such
as China and Indonesia.
Iran's constitution gives pro-
tected status to Christians, Jews
and Zoroastrians, but many reli-
gious minorities sense growing
pressures from the Islamic state
as hard-edged forces such as the
powerful Revolutionary Guard
exert more influence. There
are few social barriers separat-
ing Muslims and Iran's religious
minorities such as separate neigh-
borhoods or universities. But they
are effectively blocked from high
government and military posts.
Iran has claimed as a point of
pride that it makes space for other
religions. It reserves parliament
seats for Jewish and Christian
lawmakers and permits church-
es - Roman Catholic, Armenian
Orthodox and others - as well as
synagogues and Zoroastrian tem-
ples that are under sporadic watch
by authorities. Religious celebra-
tions are allowed, but no political
messages or overtones are toler-
ated.
In past years, authorities have

staged arrests on Christians and
other religious minorities, but the
latest sweeps appears to be among
the biggest and most coordinated.
In the West, the followers are
drawn to house churches because
of the intimate sense of religious
fellowship and as an alternative
to established denominations. In
places such as Iran, however, there
also is the effort to avoid monitor-
ing of sanctioned churches from
Islamic authorities - who have
kept closer watch on religious
minorities since the chaos after
hard-line President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad's disputed election
in 2009.
Groups monitoring Christian
affairs in the Islamic world say
Iranian authorities see the unreg-
ulated Christian gatherings as
both a potential breeding ground
for political opposition and sus-
pect they may try to convert Mus-
lim in violation of Iran's strict
apostasy laws - which are com-
mon throughout the Muslim world
and have at times fed extremist
violence against Christians and
others.
Tehran Governor Morteza
Tamadon described the Christians
as "hard-line" missionaries who
have "inserted themselves into
Islam like a parasite," according to
the official Islamic Republic News
Agency. He also suggested that
the Christians could have links
to Britain - an accusation within
Iran that refers to political oppo-
sition groups Tehran claims are
backed by the West.
The crackdown by Iran reso-
nates forcefully across the Middle
East at a time when other Chris-
tian communities feel under siege
following deadly attacks against
churches in Egypt and Iraq -
bloodshed that was noted Monday
by Pope Benedict XVI in an appeal
for protection of religious minori-
ties.
The suicide blast in Egypt's
Mediterranean port of Alexandria
on Jan. 1, which killed 21 Coptic
Christian worshippers, followed
threats by al-Qaida in Iraq over
claims that Coptic leaders forced
two women who converted to
Islam to return to Christianity -
allegations that church leaders
deny.
"It's the nature of the house
churches tha worries Iran. It's

all about possible converts," said
Fleur Brading, a researcher for
Middle East and North Africa at
Christian Solidarity Worldwide,
a British-based group the follows
Christian rights issues around the
world. "It's a very specific and pin-
point strike by Iran."
Iran's religious minorities rep-
resent about 2 percent of the pop-
ulation and include communities
with deep connections to their
faiths. Iran's ethnic Armenian
minority dates back to early Chris-
tianity, and the Jewish celebration
of Purim is built around the story
of the Persian-born Esther.
Even Iran's Islamic Revolution
could not stamp out the influence
of the pre-Muslim Zoroastrian
faith, including its new year's holi-
day Norooz in March.
The wave of arrests began
Christmas morning and since
then, opposition websites have
reported 70 Christians arrested,
including those regarded as pas-
tors in the house church move-
ment. Many were later released,
but the reports say more than a
dozen remain in detention and
officials have hinted more raids
are possible.
It's still unclear what charges
could be brought against the jailed
Christians. But allegations of try-
ing to convert Muslims could
bring a death sentence.
Brading, however, expects Ira-
nian authorities could opt for
political charges rather than reli-
gious-linked allegations to soften
a possible international outcry.
Iran is already struggling against
a campaign opposing the death-
by-stoning for an Iranian woman
convicted of adultery as well as
international pressure over its
nuclear program.
"The use of the word mission-
aries instead of evangelicals is an
intentional move by the govern-
ment," she said. "As evangelicals,
they are a group entitled to their
faith. As missionaries, they are
enemies of the state seeking to
corrupt its people."
In recent months, some mem-
bers of Iran's Armenian commu-
nity also have been detained on
unspecified allegations of working
to undermine the state, the Irani-
an Christian News Agency report-
ed. Iranian officials have not given
details of the reported detentions.

A local resident walks past a flooded building as the Brisbane river burst its banks to cause widespread flooding in Brisbane,
Australia, yesterday. Eastern Australia has been hit by weeks-long flooding that has left farmland and small towns devastated.
20 killed, over 90 missing in
deadly Australian flash floods

Flooding has
devastated the
country since Nov.
BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -
For weeks, the flooding in eastern
Australia has been a slow-motion
disaster, with drenching rain dev-
astating wide swaths of farmland
and small towns. Now, rivers are'
rising in Brisbane, the country's
third-largest city, forcing people
to flee both suburbs and skyscrap-
ers.
Flooding that has unfolded
since late November across the
waterlogged state of Queensland
turned suddenly violent Monday,
with a cloudburst sending a rag-
ing torrent down the Lockyer Val-
ley west of Brisbane. Hundreds
had to be rescued by helicopter
yesterday.
Greg Kowald was driving
through the center of the town of
Toowoomba when the terrifying
wall of water roared through the
streets, carrying away cars and
people.
"The water was literally leaping,
six or 10 feet into the air, through
creeks and over bridges and into
parks," Kowald, 53, told The Asso-
ciated Press yesterday. "There was
nowhere to escape, even if there
had been warnings. There was just
a sea of water about a kilometer (a
half-mile) wide."
The flash flood killed 10 people
and left more than 90 missing,
Quensland Premier Anna Bligh

said today. That raised to 20 the
number of confirmed dead in all
the previous weeks from high
water.
Helicopters and other emer-
gency vehicles were moving into
the worst-hit towns in the valley
today, and Bligh warned that the
death toll would likely rise.
Windows exploded, cars
bobbed in the churning brown
water and people desperately
clung to power poles to survive in
Toowoomba. Queensland Police
Commissioner Bob Atkinson
described it as "an inland instant
tsunami."
"What we saw in Toowoom-
ba was the water rise at light-
ning speed. Mother Nature has
unleashed something shocking
out of the Toowoomba region and
we've seen it move very quickly
down the range," Bligh said.
In Brisbane, 80 miles (130
kilometers) east of Toowoomba,
Mayor Campbell Newman said
almost 20,000 homes in low-'
lying areas of the city of about
2 million were expected to be
swamped by tomorrow, when the
river system is expected to crest
near the levels of a devastating
1974 flood.
"This is a truly dire set of cir-
cumstances," Prime Minister Julia
Gillard told Australian Broadcast-
ing Corp. television.
The Brisbane River broke its
banks yesterday and was continu-
ing its rise today - partly con-
trolled by a huge dam upstream
that has had its floodgates opened

because it is brimming after weeks
of rain across the state. Some
streets and riverside parks were
covered with water, though no
major flooding was reported early
today.
The city of Ipswich, home to
about 15,000 people, was being
hit by the water heading Bris-
bane's way. Floodwaters reached
the awnings of stores in the town,
where some 3,000 properties were
expected to be swamped, Mayor
Paul Pisasale said.
To the west, a deluge of up to
6 inches (150 millimeters) in a
half-hour fell over a concentrated
area Monday, sending a 26-foot
(eight-meter), fast-moving torrent
crashing through Toowoomba
and smaller towns. The flash
flood dropped as quickly as it
came, leaving debris and cars
piled together.
"There was water coming down
everywhere in biblical propor-
tions," Toowoomba council mem-
ber Joe Ramia told the AP.
When the flood struck, he
parked his car and ran for higher
ground while watching the car-
nage below: cars turned into scrap
metal and flung into a railway line;
giant metal industrial bins tossed
about as if made of paper; a man
clinging desperately to a power
pole as the relentless tide surged
around him.
A rescuer pushed through the
churning water and yanked the
man to safety as Ramia watched.
Others, including five children,
were swept to their deaths.

ties said yesterday.
Hailey Darlene Dunn, a middle
school cheerleader, was reported
missing Dec. 28, according to Colo-
rado City police. No Amber Alert
was issued because the case did
not meet the state's criteria, which
requires solid evidence that a child
has been abducted, among other
things.
State Trooper Sparky Dean said
there is no evidence that she ran
away or met foul play, although
investigators continue to follow
leads - including a witness account
that Hailey and two girls were
walking in a neighborhood a day or
two before she went missing.
The FBI, the Texas Rangers
and several sheriff's departments
are among about a dozen agencies
involved in the search. They've
scoured about 30 square miles on
foot and by helicopter and talked
to people in several neighborhoods
in Colorado City, a 4,500-resident
town about 200 miles west of Fort
Worth.
SPRINGFIELD. Ill.
Ill. bill to abolish
death penalty heads
to Gov. for decision
A bill to abolish the death penal-
ty in Illinois is on its way to Demo-
cratic Gov. Pat Quinn.
The state Senate voted 32-25 yes-
terday to abolish the punishment.
The House passed the legislation
last week.
The landmark action comes
more than a decade after then-Gov.
George Ryan cleared death row and

declared a moratorium on capital
punishment in Illinois.
It's not clear what Quinn will do
with the bill. The Chicago Demo-
crat supports the death penalty but
has continued the moratorium.
Critics say the state's capital
punishment system is fundamen-
tally flawed and point to Illinois'
record of wrongly convicting inno-
cent people.
Supporters of capital punish-
ment say Illinois has created new
safeguards. They also say execution
should be kept as a deterrent and a
bargaining chip to get confessions.
GEYSERVILLE, Calif.
Mass bird deaths
discovered in Calif.
California wildlife officials are
trying to figure out what caused the
death of more than 100 birds found
clustered together just off Highway
101.
The Santa Rosa Press Demo-
crat reports that California High-
way Patrol officers found the
dead birds near the roadway on
Saturday and called in the state
Department of Fish and Game to
investigate.
The officers who found the
birds described them as small with
brown and black feathers. They
were intact and had not been shot.
The reports come as other, larger
bird deaths have been reported in
Arkansas, Louisiana and other states.
Scientists say mass die-offs of
wildlife happen regularly, and
are usually unrelated and unre-
ported.

Detroit automakers
work to fix industry

Officials say U.S.
auto companies are
recovering from
tough economy
DETROIT (AP) - An Obama
administration official who over-
saw the restructuring of the
auto industry said yesterday he
was encouraged that U.S. auto-
makers are returning to profit-
ability despite tough economic
conditions.
Touring the Detroit auto show,
Treasury Department official
Ron Bloom said U.S. auto compa-
nies are "demonstrating that they
can make cars and make them in
America." He walked through the
exhibits of shiny new cars built by
General Motors, Ford and Chrys-
ler with Sen. Debbie Stabenow,
D-Mich., inspecting electric vehi-

cles, fuel-efficient compacts and
trucks.
"I think you're seeing a recov-
ery," Bloom said. "We obviously
hope that demand continues to
improve and I think most people
are looking at a decent increase
in demand fort'11 and I think with
that you're going to see even more
success."
GM and Chrysler were bailed
out by the Bush and Obama
administrations, which pumped
billions of dollars into the two
auto companies to keep them
afloat during the economic
downturn. GM has posted three
straight profitable quarters and
repaid about half of the govern-
ment's $50 billion investment.
Chrysler has yet to post a net
profit but is hoping to conduct a
stock sale later in the year to pay
back nearly $6 billion to taxpay-
ers.
Bloom declined to speculate on

how soon the government would
sell its remaining ownership
stakes in the two companies, say-
ing it would be "as soon as practi-
cable."
Chrysler executives said Mon-
day they will try to refinance
their government loans this
year as they prepares for an ini-
tial public stock offering. Bloom
would not address a refinance
plan, but he said, "If Chrysler
wants to pay us back, we will
keep the Treasury open late to
get their check."
Standing near an exhibitshow-
casing Ford's plans for an electric
car, Bloom said the company's
announcement that it would hire
7,000 workers during the next
two years provided evidence that
the domestic auto industry was
recovering.
"All of them are demonstrat-
ing that they can make cars and
make them in America," he said.

Secretary of State asks for
cooperation from Yemen

In unannounced
visit, Clinton
calls for joint fight
against terror
SANAA, Yemen (AP) - U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Rod-
ham Clinton yesterday urged
Yemen to step up security coop-
eration with the United States
during an unannounced visit to
shore up ties with a nation that
is fast becoming a major focus
of American counterterrorism
efforts.
Following the Obama admin-
istration's pattern in Afghani-
stan and Pakistan, Clinton also
emphasized that the United
States wanted a broader rela-
tionship with Yemen beyond
the fight against violent
extremists. Clinton is the first
U:S. secretary of state to visit
Yemen in two decades.
"We face a common threat
posed by the terrorists and
al-Qaida, but our partnership
goes beyond counterterror-
ism," she told reporters after a
nearly three-hour meeting with
Yemeni President Ali Abdal-
lah Saleh. "We're focused not
just on short-term threats but
long-term challenges," such
as Yemen's chronic poverty
and other economic and social
problems, she said.
Under tight security, Clinton
landed in the capital of Sanaa,
where she pressed Yemeni
leaders to crack down further
on radicals who have used the
country as a base for launch-
ing attacks on the U.S. The
radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki,
thought to be hiding in Yemen,
is suspected of having inspired
some of those attacks.
"I want to be frank about
the fact that there are terror-
ists operating from Yemeni
territory today - many of
whom are not Yemeni, some
of whom, I am sorry to say, are
Americans," Clinton told stu-
dents, lawmakers and rights
activists at a town hall meet-
ing. "They represent an urgent
concern for the United States.
They have sought to attack our
country."
"Stoppingsuchthreats would
be a priority for any nation, and
it is a priority for the United
States. It is also a priority for
Yemen," she said.
At the same time, Clinton

said the U.S. supports efforts to
address the underlying causes of
extremism: poverty, corruption,
social inequality and political
divisions that have boiled into an
insurgency. She said Yemen must
stop thepractice of child marriage
and enact reforms.
"We seek a unified, stable,
democratic and prosperous
Yemen where civil society has
room to operate, but al-Qaida
does not," she said. She noted
that the Obama administration
had tripled aid to Yemen over the

past two years and rebalanced
the package so it is not "dispro-
portionally" weighted toward
military and security.
In the past five years, U.S.
military assistance to Yemen has
totaled about $250 million. In
2010, military and civilian aid was
almost evenly split and combined
for about $300 million.
Military aid to Yemen would
reach $250 million in 2011 alone,
U.S. officials said, and Clinton
said there will be additional
development aid.

Don't let our people go
Legislators need to bring people back to Michigan
t's no secret that Michigan's population has been decreasing
over the past several years. With one of the worst economies
in the country, cities that were once bustling are simply run-
ning out of people. The decline in residents was confirmed by the
results of the 2010 United States Census. While it's understand-
able that people are leaving the state because they need to support
themselves and their families, the aftermath has caused a serious
problem for the state: the loss of a seat in the U.S. House of Repre-
sentatives. Michigan needs to quickly begin the process of rebuild-
ing its population to regain its seat in Congress.

Brady Hope

According to a Jan. 7.Daily article, Michi-
gan will losea seat in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives in 2012 because of population
decreases. The 2010 U.S. Census concluded
that in the last decade, Michigan's popula-
tion dropped by nearly 1 million people - or
0.6 percent. In this census, Michigan had
the largest population decrease of any state
in the country. The loss of a seat in the U.S.
House of Representatives will leave Michi-
gan with 14 seats. The census results also
impact the, amount of federal funding the
state receives from Washington - a number
that will also decrease in light of the drop in
population.
Losing a seat in the House is a huge loss
for the state. The number of representatives
determines how many people are in Wash-
ington campaigning for Michigan anal its
needs. With one less representative at work
for us, the state will not have the same ability
to impact votes and push issues. Addition-
ally, having one less person will undeniably
result in decreased federal funding for the
state. And those funds are an integral com-
ponent in rebuilding Michigan's economy
and infrastructure. Michigan needs to work
to regain its lost seat in order to ensure that
representatives have solidified support in
Washington.
Equally unfortunate as the decline in rep-
resentation is the decrease in federal fund-

ing. Population and the number of House
representatives are major factors in deter-
mining how much money is allotted to a
state. The decrease in both will make it dif-
ficult for our already cash-strapped state to
have money to put toward sectors like public
transportation and education. It's likely that
students at the University - and public uni-
versities throughout the state - will notice
this loss of funding.
One of the best ways to combat this prob-
lem is for Republican Gov. Rick Snyder to
help the state develop new, innovative job
markets that will draw people back to Michi-
gan. Once people are ensured that they can
find work in Michigan, they will begin to
return to the state. But in order to expand
businesses, there needs to be people to work
the jobs and purchase the products. This
means that people need to be attracted to the
state by more than job prospects. Improve-
ments to public education and special atten-
tion to environmental issues will help to
bring people to Michigan and regain lost
representation and funding.
Between the Great Lakes and once thriv-
ing cities - like Detroit - Michigan is an
exceptional place to live. But if people can't
support themselves here they will under-
standably leave. The state government needs
to work to create jobs and bring people back
to Michigan.

We wanted Jim Harbaugh.
The man looked per-
feet on paper and on the
field. A one-loss
season at a pres- l
tigious academic
institution, a Heis-
man-contender
quarterback with
great recruits sur-
rounding him and
integrity on and
off the field. Sure,
he had made some ERIC
negative remarks SZKARLAT
about his alma
mater's academic
standards, but who
could blame him? All it takes is one
look at the Demar Dorsey incident
to see that we have been attempting
to recruit football players below our
typical academic level.
But Harbaugh said no. The hottest
coach available this season, he went
to the NFL to coach the San Francis-
co 49ers.
We kicked and screamed. We asked
how a "Michigan Man" could turn his
back on this great University.
Then we saw Les Miles.
He ran a spread offense, so the
transition would be easy. He has a
National Championship under his
belt and, best of all, he had to beat
Jim Tressel and the Ohio State Buck-
eyes to get it. Miles played under Bo
Schembechler, and he has recruiting
ties to what is often considered "the
best conference in college football" -
the Southeastern Conference. Yes, he
had over signed some recruits, and he
had an odd habit of eating grass. But
we knew we would win with him.
But Miles said no too. Louisiana
State retained their head coach for
another season.
We were silent. We hung our heads
in disappointment and despair. If not
Miles, then who? Who could take up
the torch of the winningest college

football program?
Enter Brady Hoke.
A dismal overall record at Ball
State and only one winning.season
at San Diego State. He disapproves
of the spread and has even called it
"basketball on grass." The transition
would be tough. What's more is that
he is known to run the despised 3-3-5
defensive scheme that Rich Rod was
often criticized for running. He may
be a "Michigan Man" and he may,
have had some moderate successes,
but they've come from lower-end
conferences and teams.'
But Hoke said yes. Many were dis-
appointed that we only got our third
choice for coach.
I was, like many others, rooting for
Harbaugh. Then for Miles. I wanted
anybody before I wanted Brady Hoke
to be our next coach. I didn't"think
he would be successful based off the;
numbers. He only seemed to man-
age to turn around Ball State's pro-
gram and he had moderate success at
SDSU. A 9-4 season isn't satisfactory
to the Michigan fan base.
But he is now our coach. He is the
next man to lead our football team,
and we need to support him. It's that
or bust again, like it was in 2008.
We've lived through 3-9 and 5-7.
Finally, things seemed like they
would improve going into 2010. But
they didn't. Not enough to beat Ohio
State, Michigan State or Mississippi
State, or even play remotely competi-
tively in any of those match ups. It
seemed like yet another failure of a
season, despite the improved record.
But look at former football coach
Gary Moeller. The man had a terrible
record in the Big Ten before we hired"
him away from Illinois. He was a
coach under Bo for a while and finally
- when he got his turn - he led us to
three Big Ten Championships in five
years. We gave him the benefit of the
doubt and he succeeded. We need to
do the same for Hoke.

Brady Hoke - in spite of his seem-
ingly unimpressive successes as a
head coach - coached under Lloyd
Carr. He coached the same defense
which featured Heisman trophy win-
ner Charles Woodson. He helped to
coach our team to a National Cham-
pionship and to two more Big Ten
Championships in his previous time
at Michigan.
So why the lack of faith?
Here we have a man who under-
stands Michigan football. He knows
what it means to us. He might just be
able to restore our program to its for-
mer glory.
Give Hoke the
benefit of the doubt
and he will suceed.
We're at a fork in the road of Mich-
igan football history. You may devi-
ate and oppose the Hoke hire and say
bad things about him as a coach or as
a person. Or you may maintain the
path that Hoke will now be leading
us down. That path may or may not
lead to victory. I don't know any bet-
ter than anyone else which it will be.
I can assure you, though, that
no matter where Hoke will lead us,
opposing him will not bring Michi-
gan to victory. He is our only hope
right now. You don't have to believe
in Hoke to support him. If you believe 0
in Michigan, and if you bleed Maize
and Blue, you will cheer Hoke and his
men forward. You will stay.
After all, that is the only way to
become a champion.

SETH SODERBORG I
Obama's Christmas miracle

For a student from Ann Arbor, driving
through Detroit can feel like driving through
another world. "Lock your car doors" was
the warning I remembered as I gently turned
toward exit 51 off of I-75. As I pulled up to the
stop sign, I could feel my car tires slow. The
rain drummed in heavy time as the wipers
stepped in tune. I was alone except for Neil
Young on the radio in a city that sprawled for
miles, and he was safe and dry in the record-
ings of WOMC.
I turned onto Jefferson Avenue, a wide, five-
lane road that Ishad all to myself. The city made
cars, and its streets were made for these cars,
but both had long been abandoned with the
rise of freeways and suburbs. The day I was
there, I was one of two drivers on the road and
the other was far on the horizon. I soon found
Manistique Road, my destination, where I was
expected at the harvest festival.
The festival was put on by Feedom-Freedom
Growers, a community collaborative that began
in 2008 as a way to meet local needs by culti-
vating both food and relationships. The proj-
ect began as a single garden bed at the home of
Wayne Curtis and Myrtle Thompson. The fam-
ily was tired of seeing their neighborhood as a
place where people were uncomfortable, with
their closest neighbors scattered over several.
blocks. Plus, vacant houses become a hazard
when they're not cared for and attract drug
sales, dogfights, arson and vandalism among
other things. They wanted to recreate a com-
munity that was no longer there by drawing
people to their garden, which now spans into
the empty lot next to their home. The fam-
ily has hopes of expanding the garden to the
empty lot across from the current location in
order to better meet community needs.
All the produce that is grown at the Feedom-
Freedom garden is organic and is sold to neigh-
bors and visitors of the garden. The produce is
alsotaken to the Eastern Marketin Detroit every
Saturday morning to be sold alongside other
Detroit-grown produce. The growing process
was aided by the Greening of Detroit, which
initially provided soil for the inner-city garden.
Leaves are donated from various parts of the city

to put the garden to bed for the winter.
Urban farming has become a popular phe-
nomenon in Detroit, and it's not hard to see
why when the city has more than 66,000 vacant
lots. During the automobile boom of World War
II, people were unable to foresee the conse-
quences of their massive expansion of the city
borders once the rush for labor ended. Auto-
mation, outsourcing and racial tension quickly
emptied the city. Today, the geographical areas
of San Francisco, Manhattan and Boston can
fit inside the greater Detroit area, which has a
population of less than 1 million.
Besides needing to do something with its
vacant lots, Detroit is also in need of grocery
stores that carry fresh fruits and vegetables.
Detroit's title used to be the Motor City, but
the city is now known as the world's top potato
chip consumer. Attributing to this new title
could be the fact that Detroit is now considered
a food desert. Roughly 550,000 Detroit resi-
dents - more than half of the city's total popu-
lation - live in areas that are far out-of-balance
in terms of day-to-day food availability. This
group of people must travel twice as far, or
further, to reach a grocery store that carries
fresh fruits and vegetables than as they do to
reach the closest food location. These "fringe"
locations include fast food restaurants, conve-
nience or liquor stores and gas stations. Urban
farming provides fresh produce that is grown
in close proximity to where people live: in their
own neighborhoods.
While urban farming has been hailed by
most, it does have its critics. Rev. Jessie Jack-
son is among them. He says the endeavor is
"cute, but foolish" and calls on industry to save
Detroit. Detroit was a city made from industry
and also abandoned by it. Its people are tired
of waiting for a savior and have begun to cre-
ate their own community, bottom up. Detroit
can never go back to its industrial past, and
activists such as Wayne Curtis realize this -
residents must create their own future. Maybe
urban farming won't save Detroit, but maybe
Jessie is wrong.

If you follow national news, you know that we live in
an era of hyper-partisanship. You know that President
Barack Obama can't corral his own party. You know that
if he would just stand up to the Republicans, he would get
things done. You know that he isn't getting things done.
You know that national politics is, for all intents and pur-
poses, irretrievably broken. Depending on where you get
your information, you know that our president is either
a dangerous communist who exploits the office of the
.President to force his radical agenda upon unsuspect-
ing patriots, or a wimp with fewer "cojones" than his
secretary of state. George W. Bush's recent presidential
memoir informs us that having "the cojones" to do tough
things is a key test of one's fitness for the presidency. By
that slightly scatological standard, Obama has failed.
Here's the thing: In the past month, the president sin
cojones got a supposedly ineffective, hopelessly polarized
and now lame-duck Congress that never does anythingto
do exactly what he wanted - just in time for Christmas.
What did Obama bring us in his holiday legislation
blitz, you ask? Help for the beleaguered, in the form of
extended unemployment benefits. Money in everyone's
wallet, thanks to tax cuts. Jobs, the result of reduced
payroll and social security taxes. A safer world, thanks
to a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia. Well-
deserved rest, in the form of health care compensation
for 9/11 first responders. Freedom, in the repeal of that
odious law, "don't ask don't tell."
How did he do it? The old-fashioned way: through com-
promise. The arms reduction treaty passed 71-26. "Don't
ask don't tell" was repealed by a vote of 65-31, including
eight Republicans. The tax bill - which included those
unemploymentbenefits - passed the House 277-148, with
112 of those "no" votes coming from Democrats. And the
bill to help 9/11 responders? It passed the Senate unani-
mously after almost all senators reprimanded Repub-
licans like Rep. Lamar Smith (R Texas), who called the
plan an "$8.4 billion slush fund."
Compromise, of course, means giving the other side

some of the things it wants. Obama's blitz was possible
because it started with him swallowing a bitter pill. A
few weeks ago, Senate Republicans signed a pledge saying
they wouldn't vote on anything until congress approved
and the president signed a controversial tax-cut exten-
sion package for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.
Numerous commentators suggested that the tax cuts
would do more harm than good. Still, the Republicans got
what they wanted in a sense. The tax cuts were extended
- and continued to favor the wealthiestAmericans - but
the extension was for only two years. Democrats cried
foul. Most of them voted against the bill and then raised
a stink about the president giving in to Republicans even
when his own patty controlled both houses of Congress
by a wide margin. In the wake of the tax cuts, the rhet-
oric of partisanship was as loud as it ever is these days,
and some speculated that the president would soon face a
revolt in his party - perhaps even a challenge in the 2012
primary elections. That now seems unlikely.
Getting everyone on board with these proposals took
quite a bit of money. The tax cut and unemployment bene-
fit package will cost $860 billion over two years - several
hundred billion dollars were included simply to placate
Republicans. In effect, the president bought the support
of dozens of Republicans by agreeing to spend billions
of dollars on tax cuts for the wealthy and for business.
Hyper-partisanship, it seems, means little more than a
higher price tag when it comes time to placate politicians
with pork. With enough money at stake, even a do-noth-
ing Congress can be persuaded to act.
Obama's Christmas miracle is, in many ways, a miracle.
But like most real miracles, it came at a high cost. Our
president proved that he both has cojones and knows
how to play politics. But we should be asking ourselves
whether the compromise and results we expect of our
government are worth the billions of dollars they seem
to require.

"(It's) like this is a new start of
what Michigan always has been:'

Diego State coach would be the
Wolverines' coach next season.
The room immediately erupt-
ed in a big cheer and a round of
applause.
Brandon told the players how he
had talked to Hoke's former play-
ers and coaches who knew him,
and those who knew Hoke painted
the picture of a good guy, a players'
coach.
"Dave Brandon was sold, and we
are too," junior wide receiver Dar-
ryl Stonum said.
Former Michigan All-American
Steve Hutchinson spoke to Bran-
don during the coaching search
and vouched for Hoke as well.
Hutchinson came to Michigan as
a defensive lineman initially and
Hoke was his position coach for
that short time before he switched
to offensive guard - Hoke was the
defensive line coach at Michigan
from 1995-2002 under Lloyd Carr.
And Hutchinson still stays in con-
tact with Hoke to this day.
"From everything I've heard
about (Hoke), you know, I grew up
watching Charles Woodson and
Steve Hutchinson and Brian Gri-
ese play and all of those guys called
Dave Brandon on their own behalf
and said this is the best coach,"
Heininger said. "Steve Hutchin-
son said this is the best coach he's
ever had - how could I argue with
that?"
Even with the high praise, many

However, Vashi added that Hoke
made it clear he truly wants to be
here.
"I think that there's a lot of criti-
cisms and a lot of negativity that
will certainly arise from certain
factions of the campus because he
doesn't have the pedigree, and he
doesn't have the resume that some
of the other candidates have,"
Vashi said. "But I think that one
good thing is he really wanted
to come here, unlike some other
people who might've just been
careerists."
LSA junior Connor Roncaioli
said he was in the Union when
the news hit and the reaction he
observed was largely negative.
"I was at the ballroom at Win-
terfest, and some guy stood up and
announced it," he said. "There was
more booing than cheering."
LSA freshman Nate Snyder
expressed a similar amount of neg-
ativity regarding the University's
new hire.
"There's a new dance called the
Hokey Pokey where you stab your
eyes out," Snyder said.
Less vocal but equally bleak,
LSA junior Bryan Fraley said he
simply didn't want to talk about it.
But some students like Engi-

Mariah Zeisberg, an assistant

Zeisberg said.
Yonah Lieberman, co-chair of
the JustDems committee of Col-
lege Democrats, helped organize
the event and led a moment of
silence.
LSA junior Kaitlin Liroff, a
member of the student group
Human Rights Through Educa-
tion, attended the vigil. She said
violence can erode humanity, and
America is "better than that."
"I think that whenever people
get together to do something posi-
tive, the world becomes a better
place," Liroff said. "(The vigil)
might have been small, but I think
it was still meaningful."
LSA junior Elizabeth Hartig, a
member of College Democrats, was
also present at the vigil and also
thought the turnout was impres-
sive considering the weather.
"I think that tragedy shows that
there is some hate in America, but
the response to it is far greater
than the hate," Hartigsaid.
In a Jan. 8 press release, U.S.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.)

of the players didn't know much
about the former San Diego State
and Ball State coach who has a
career record of 47-50.
Koger didn't know much more
about Hoke than where he had
previously coached. And Stonum
admitted he didn't know much,
either, but was eager to meet Hoke
on Tuesday.
"So far we know he's hard-work-
ing, (and) he's all about Michigan
- he's a 'Michigan Man,' " fresh-
man defensive end Jibreel Black
said. "We want somebody to come
in, where the atmosphere won't be
so new to him. He's been in the Big
House so we won't have to intro-
duce that to him. He knows pretty
muchwhat Michigan stands for."
Brandonmadeitclearduringlast
week's press conference announc-
ing Rich Rodriguez's termination
that the coach's successor would
have to have an understanding of
Michigan and the unique challeng-
es theschool presents. Hoke also fit
the bill as the defensive-oriented
coach whom Brandon wanted to
bring in - an attribute that drew
smiles from the defensive players
who emerged after the meeting.
They were also happy that this
time around, unlike when they
heard about Rodriguez's fate, the
players were among the first to
hear about Hoke - instead of the
news breaking long before they
were told.
"It's weird watching stuff on
TV and not really knowing what's

going on," said redshirtsophomore
running back Mike Cox. "And then
all of a sudden being told about
your coach not being here. It's defi-
nitely better (knowing first)."
According to a source with
knowledge of the situation, the play-
ers will meet Hoke sometime before
his scheduled introductory press
conference at1 p.m. tomorrow.
The Wolverines already have a
feeling that the atmosphere around
Schembechler Hall might could
revert back to the pre-Rodriguez
era - when the coaches were prod-
ucts of the building's namesake.
Many in the Michigan commu-
nity thought the former West Vir-
ginia coach just didn't understand
the school's tradition. A common
theme throughout the Michigan
players' reaction was that Hoke
justgotit.
"We're really glad this is all
over," Heininger said. "(It's) like
thisis a new start of what Michigan
always has been. And this is the
kind of coach you want. Dave Bran-
don really did have a process as he
explained in there and he stuck by
it no matter what everybody said.
He wanted the best person for us,
and that's who we got."
Added Stonum: "You're bringing
in a Michigan guy. (When) I was
recruited here I knew all about the
tradition. And all about the win-
ning. And all about everything else
that Michigan has to offer. From
what I hear, (Hoke's) goingto bring
that back."

HOKE
From Page 1A
gan's Jan.1 bowl game, many were
convinced that former Michigan
quarterback Jim Harbaugh -
tapped by many as a prototypical
"Michigan Man" - would spurn
his Stanford team to help return
his declining alma mater to its
glory days.
But when Harbaugh opted to
coach the NFL's San Francisco
49ers, the choice seemed to be
Les Miles, another Michigan
Man who played with Brandon
under former coach Bo Schem-
bechler in the 1970s. After meet-
ing with Brandon on Monday,
Miles quashed any speculation the
next day, announcing his return to
Baton Rouge, La.
With both Harbaugh and Miles
out of the picture, the door opened
for another Michigan Man - Hoke,
who served as the Wolverines'
defensive line coach during the
team's 1997 National Champion-
ship run.
Following the announcement,
Brandon denied that either Har-
baugh or Miles were ever offered
the job.
"The job vias never offered to
them," Brandon said. "We did have
different discussions with them
that were helpful and positive."
The athletic director main-
tained, six days after he cut ties
with Rodriguez, that Hoke was his
first choice.
Rodriguez was criticized
throughout his 15-22 tenure for
not understanding the tradition of
college football's most winningest
program. So when Brandon
announced that Michigan would
undergo its second coaching
search in three years, an under-
standing of the program's history

was naturally one of his criteria.
And with eight years in Ann Arbor
under his belt, Hoke definitively fit
Brandon's requirement.
"Brady Hoke understands
Michigan and he wanted this job
because it has been dream job,"
Brandon told the AP. "We won't
have to teach him the words to'The
Victors,' and I believe our players
will respond to him because I got
100 percent positive feedback from
anybody who played for him here
or since he left Michigan."
Aside from struggling to grasp
Michigan's traditions, Rodriguez's
teams were known for notoriously
bad defense, finishing 108th, 82nd
and 67th in total defense in the
coach's three years at the helm.
So when Brandon was asked
about improving the Wolverines'
defense with a new coach, Bran-
don made his intentions clear.
"Is there a thought of getting
a defensive-minded head coach?
- There's a thought of getting a
defensive-minded everything,"
Brandon said at last week's press
conference. "I want the ball boys
to be defensive-minded."
And with Hoke, the Wolver-
ines will get just that, as the coach
turned San Diego State's 114th-
ranked defense into the nation's
44th-ranked unit in just two years
as the Aztecs' coach.
Much of that may have been
due to his defensive coordina-
tor, Rocky Long, who runs a 3-3-5
defense similar to what former
Michigan defensive coordinator
Greg Robinson ran last season. But
with Long primed to replace Hoke
as Sari Diego State's head coach,
the Wolverines' coordinator posi-
tions are wide open. That includes
the offensive coordinator spot, as
Calvin Magee took the same job at
Pitt this afternoon.
Hoke's coaching pedigree, how-

ever, has been a cause for concern
for some - especially at the advent
of Michigan's coaching search
when Hoke was named as a pos-
sible candidate.
In eight years as head coach of
Ball State and San Diego State,
Hoke finished a modest 47-50,
with a 1-1 record in bowl games.
He also managed just one win
against a ranked team in both of
his previous jobs combined.
The Big Ten will offer Hoke
a serious competition upgrade
from the Mid-American Confer-
ence and the Mountain West, and
an offensive overhaul could be in
store - the Aztecs ran a pro-style
offense, with quarterback Ryan
Lindley accounting for -33 yards
on the ground in 2010.
And with Denard Robinson -
one of the most dangerous running
quarterbacks in NCAA history - at
his disposal, Hoke's approach to
Michigan's offense could be the
talk of the next few weeks, espe-
cially since Robinson has yet to
comment on whether he'd stay in
Ann Arbor without Rodriguez as
coach.
Question marks aside, Hoke
has made it clear all along that -
unlike Harbaugh and Miles - his
career goal was to become head
coach at Michigan. And with
Brandon's hiring of a Michigan
Man, many alumni and current
players have reacted positively to
their new coach.
"This is a new start of what
Michigan always has been," red-
shirt junior defensive end Will
Heininger said last night after a
players' meeting. "And this is the
kind of coach you want. Dave Bran-
don really did have a process as he
explained in there and he stuck by
it no matter what everybody said.
He wanted the best person for us
and that's who we got."



neering freshman Adam Zander
said he was optimistic about the
change.
"It's nice to get hyped about a
new coach," he said.
LSA junior Katy Tylus said Hoke
is a good fit, especially "after the
whole Rich Rod thing."
Two field managers for the
Michigan football team, who asked
to remain anonymous, said they
both supported Rodriguez and
were unhappy with the original
decision to fire him.
"I feel like most people inside
knew how hard everyone was
working, and that they were going
in the right direction," one of the
field managers said. "It's just there
was so much pressure from the
outside that the athletic director
couldn't really afford to keep him
around."
The other field manager said
that while he's willing to accept the
decision, he doesn't know enough
about Hoke to say whether he was
agood choice.
"I know that he was coach of
Ball State and San Diego State, but
as far as the specifics, like, I don't
really know what his philosophy is
and stuff," he said.
The field manager added that a
lot will depend on the staff Hoke
brings with him.
"We don't know yet who he's
bringing along with him. That's

a very underrated part," he said.
"The head coach gets all the glory
and blame, but the assistant coach-
es actually are a very important
part of it."
University alumni said it is cru-
cial for Michigan's fan base to be
supportive-of the Wolverines' new
coach.
University alum Ira Jaffe, who
graduated from the Law School in
1963, said he fully endorses Hoke
and hopes the University gives him
plenty of time to develop a strong
program.
"I'm happy that we have some-
body in place and can concentrate
on recruiting and the positive
things rather than the turmoil,"
Jaffe said. "I think it's the job of
alumni to get behind the new coach
and be patient so we're supportive
rather than destructive."
University alum Joshua Futer-
man, who graduated last month,
also stressed the need for unity.
"Now is the time that Michi-
gan faithful need to rally behind
Brady Hoke - whether they like
him or not," Futerman said. "And
he's a Michigan Man, which people
talk about a lot. I'm going to rally
behind him."

everything. I want the ball boys
to be defensive minded."
There's alot to like about this
guy, and I'm sure we'll all hear a
lot more about that in the coming
days. But what I like best is that
former Wolverines like this guy.
These are the same big-name
alumni who criticized Michi-
gan after humiliating losses to
Ohio State and Mississippi State.
These are some of the same for-
mer players who didn't show this
kind of support for former coach
Rich Rodriguez throughout his
tenure.
When you're a program like
Michigan and you pride yourself
in producing Michigan Men who
go on to compete in the NFL, it's
clear how important your alumni
network is. You want former play-

ers to effectively act as recruiters.
You want them pumping up the
program when it's down.
You want a guy like Steve
Hutchinson, a member of that
1997 national championship
team, to remain connected and
committed to Michigan. Accord-
ingto current players after their
team meeting Tuesday evening,
Hutchinson had previously called
Brandon to voice support for hir-
ing Hoke.
Maybe that's what the Wolver-
ines need here, as they transition
from the Rodriguez era into the
future.
They need a guy that former
stars support, and a guy that cur-
rent players can get excited about
- and they are. Several players
said they all applauded Brandon's
announcement in their team
meeting. Multiple players gave the
media thumbs up on their way out
of Schembechler Hall, where the

meeting was held.
The next step for the players?
"Everybody (has to) buy in,"
junior linebacker J.B. Fitzger-
ald told the assembled media. "I
think everybody realizes that. You
know, the first time it didn't really
go as well because everybody
wasn't really buying in.... The
chemistry is real good right now.
Everybody's excited, and every-
body's ready to get it started."
Maybe it's not always about a
big-name coach or even a guy with
a career head coaching record over
.500. Maybe alumni support and
players buying in means a lot more
than we originally thought.
If that's the case, then Michigan
fans should feel pretty confident
about the Hoke hire. A Wolverine
fan base excited about its coach? I
can't wait to watch.

Man assaults Chi Psi fraternity
member, breaks house window


addressed the effects of the shoot-
ings on the nation's political cli-
mate and commended Giffords's
prior political successes.
"Our democracy was attacked
(on Saturday)," Dingell wrote in
the press release. "We are out-
raged and horrified by the violent
attack that occurred on our citi-
zens, including one of our great
young American leaders, Gabby
Giffords, who is one of the kind-
est and most dedicated members
of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives."
According to John Garcia,
research professor of archival
development at the University's
Institute for Social Research, the
shootingcame at a time when both
the nation and specifically the
state of Arizona have been facing
divisions regarding the issue of
immigration.
Garcia said in an interview
yesterday that he feels the state's
immigration debates have become
increasingly contentious.
"It's a climate that in the state at
large has become much more hos-
tile," he said.
Garcia, who taught at the Uni-
versity of Arizona for more than 30
years before coming to Ann Arbor,
added that the heated immigra-
tion debate in Arizona is especially
concerning because it extorts
anger and hatred and uses meta-
phors and references that are more
violent in nature.
It's especially ironic in Tucson,
Garcia said, since the city is con-
sidered one of the more liberal or
moderate in Arizona.
"In relation to the incident in
Tucson, immigration is (not) so
much the issue, but it's just the
tone around that issue," Garcia
said. "I think it's been more the
focus in terms of how do we deal

with issues that seem to divide
good segments of this country, and
it's a matter of saying, 'Well, what'
do we do about it?"'
Garcia also addressed the ris-
ing issue of Second Amendment
rights, following questions of the
shooter's mental stability and con-
cerns of his access to guns. Ari-
zona residents can attain firearms
with relative ease, Garcia said.
Arizona's gun law allows people
age 21 or older carry concealed
guns without a permit, according
to the AP.
Garcia said there was even a
proposal in the Arizona Legisla-
ture to permit individuals to carry
concealed weapons on college
campuses throughout the state.
"Allitdoesisitjustfeedsintothe
mindset that if you got a problem
with somebody, violence and guns
is not an uncommon response,"
Garcia said. "It's not unique to
that state because I think there's a
whole national climate that paral-
lels that type of mindset."
Garcia also mentioned the plans
of Westboro Baptist Church in
Topeka, Kan.- an anti-gay church
that has gained notoriety for its
protest activities throughout the
nation, including in Ann Arbor -
to protest the funerals of the vic-
tims in Tucson.
"That's always the most extreme
point of view, but that climate
there, it can't help but affect how
people see each other or how they
think about each other," he said.
"There's things going on in Ari-
zona that reflect a (heightened)
kind of hostility ... just in terms of
the relationship between anger
and debate and violence and guns
and symbols ... but atthesametime
I would suggest that you find it
elsewhere in the U.S. as well," Gar-
cia said.

AAPD says suspect
is still at large

A man broke a window and
assaulted a student at the Chi Psi
fraternity house early. Sunday
morning, according to the Ann
Arbor Police Department.
According to AAPD Lt. Angella
Abrams, a caller reported that he
heard a commotion from the first
floor of the house. When fraternity
members went to investigate the
sound, they discovered a man - the
current suspect - with a bloody
right hand, Abrams said.
After a fraternity brother con-
fronted the man, the suspect
reportedly punched the student in
the face and fled, Abrams said. The
suspect remains at large.

of the Chi Psi fraternity on cam-
pus, said he called the AAPD's
non-emergency line because he
didn't believe it was necessary to
have officers come to the house
and investigate the matter, which
occured between 1:30 a.m. and 2
a.m. Sunday morning.
Abrams said officers were not
dispatched to the scene to inves-
tigate, but a police report was
filed. The police report estimates
the cost of damage to the window
is $300, but officers weren't on
scene to observe the damage, she
said.
Pry said it appears that the sus-
pect - who's not affiliated with the
fraternity - was inside the vesti-
bule of the house when he punched
the window.
Pry said the incident occurred
following a social event hosted at
the fraternity house. When asked
whether the suspect attended the
event, Pry said he was not sure.

"It was someone that none of us
knew," Pry said. "Whether or not
he was in the event, I do not know."
Pry also said the member who
was assaulted was nothospitalized.
"It wasn't that bad of a punch,"
Pry said. "Just a little bump on his
head."
Pry added that he's unaware as
to why the suspect allegedly com-
mitted the assault and malicious
destruction of property.
Abrams said she doesn't believe
this incident is a sign of increased
violence among fraternities.
"I don't have anything to sub-
stantiate the allegation that fra-
ternities are a target," Abrams
said. "I believe this is an isolated
incident."
Similarly, both Pry and Inter-
fraternity Council President Jared
Jaffe said they don't believe the
incident reflects a trend of violence
in the Greek community on cam-
pus.

Transgender veterans advocate for
military access with DADT repeal

MSA passes resolution.
to reach out to students

Estimates: 300,000
transgender people
have served
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Before handcuffing herself to the
White House fence, former Petty
Officer First Class Autumn San-
deen carefully pinned three rows
of Navy ribbons to her chest. Her
regulation dress blue skirt, fitted
jacket, hat and black pumps were
new - fitting for a woman who
spent two decades serving her
country asa man.
Sandeen was the only transgen-
der person among the six veterans
arrested in April while protest-
ing the military's ban on openly
gay troops. But when she watched
'President Barack Obama last
month sign the hard-fought bill
allowing for the ban's repeal, mel-
ancholy tinged her satisfaction.
"This is another bridesmaid
moment for the transgender com-
munity," the 51-year-old San Diego
resident said.
The "don't ask, don't tell" policy
now heading toward history does
not apply to transgender recruits,
who are automatically disqualified
as unfit for service. But the mili-
tary's long-standing posture on
gender-identity has not prevented
transgender citizens from signing
up before they come out, or from
obtaining psychological counsel-
ing, hormones and routine health

care through the Department of
Veterans Affairs once they return
to civilian life.
So as the Pentagon prepares to
welcome openly gay, lesbian and
bisexual service members for the
first time, Sandeen is not alone in
hoping the United States will one
day join the seven other nations
- Canada, the United Kingdom,
Spain, Israel, the Czech Repub-
lic, Thailand and Australia - that
allow transgender troops.
"There is really no question, it's
just a matter of when," said former
Army Capt. Allyson Robinson, 40,
a 1994 West Point graduate who
has spoken to sociology classes at
the alma mater she attended as a
male cadet. "There are active-duty,
as well as reserve and national
guard transgender service mem-
bers, serving today."
No one knows how many trans-
gender people are serving or have
served. Neither the Department of
Defense nor the VA keep statistics
on how many service members
have been discharged or treated
for transgender conditions or con-
duct.
The Transgender American
Veterans Association, an advocacy
group founded in 2003, estimates
there could be as many as 300,000
transgender people among the
nation's 26 million veterans.
When 50 TAVA members
laid a wreath at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier six years ago,
representatives from every U.S.

conflict since World War II were
there, said former Navy Machinist
Mate First Class Monica Helms,
the group's co-founder and presi-
dent.
Most had spent years, if not
decades, as veterans before they
could acknowledge the mismatch-
es between their brains and their
bodies. Helms, 59, spent four years
in the engine room of a nuclear
submarine during the Vietnam
War, but did not start living as
Monica until 1997.
Military regulations state that
men and women who identify
with or present a gender differ-
ent from their sex at birth have
mental conditions that make them
ineligible to serve. Those who have
undergone genital surgery are
listed as having physical abnor-
malities. Service members caught
cross-dressing on base have been
court-martialed for interfering
with "good order and discipline,"
according to the National Center
for Transgender Equality.
Until the American Psychiatric
Association removes Gender Iden-
tity Disorder from its Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, as it did for homosexu-
ality in 1973, that's likely to remain
the case, Sandeen said.
The very diagnosis that keeps
transgender Americans out of uni-
form has enabled some to obtain
transition-related medical care
and other services when they
become veterans.

- Love to hate, hate to love the 'Shore'

Just when you thought the guido garbage
couldn't get any worse ... it did
By Jacob Axelrad ( Daily Arts Writer

I tolerated the first season. I cringed
when the second began. And now I have
to put my foot down. "Jersey Shore" - the
MTV reality series that made The Situation
and Snooki into household names - has
officially overstayed its welcome, and it's
time for it to end.
For those who don't know, the series
chronicles the lives of eight housemates
0 spending their summer together in Seaside
Heights at the Jersey Shore. Oh yeah, and
one other thing: The castmates are eight of
the most self-absorbed, shallow and, for all
intents and purposes, pathetic people you
will ever see on or off television A far cry
indeed from its more restrained and taste-
ful counterparts, "Big Brother" and "The
Real World."
The first part of the second season repli-
cated this premise with the only difference
being the location, Miami. Now the cast has
returned to the Shore - all of them, that
is, except Angelina (the one cast member
who seems to have had the bright idea to
get the hell off the show). But Angelina's
been replaced by a Snooki lookalike, Deena.
Unfortunately, this means that it's back to
the land of spray-on tans, hair gel, overex-
aggerated stereotypes and castmembers
who are beyond caricatures of themselves.
As Vinny himself so eloquently puts it, he
needs to go back: "Like a monkey has to go
to the jungle, I belong at the Jersey Shore."
Evidently, the reason for this show's contin-
ued existence is biology. And here I thought
it was just MTV cashing in on a profitable

franchise.
Since it debuted in 2009, I've heard the
gauntlet of defenses for the show. "It's so
addictive," or, "It's great for theme parties,"
or, my personal favorite, "It's just reality
TV. Obviously it's not 'real.' " This may be
true, but the fact remains that the quality
is so poor, the people so absurdly awful and
the portrayal of Italian-Americans so offen-
sive that I can no longer sit idly by and pre-
tend that it's an acceptable guilty pleasure,
because it's not.
For starters, let's look at midseason pre-
miere, "Back to the Shore." Pauly D, Snooki,
Mike "The Situation," Jenni "JWOWW,"
Ronnie, Sammi "Sweetheart," Vinny and
Deena converge on the Shore house for the
summer.
Immediately upon arrival, arguments
break outconcerning bedroom assignments
and Deena's presence. Overlooking all the
cursing that makes the episode sound likea
bunch of bleeps linked together by the occa-
sional reference to sex, hot tubs or hatred
for the other cast members, we can see that
we're literally watching the same show from
two years ago - and the producers couldn't
even come up with a different location!
So what does this mean? Well, since MTV
is unlikely to take the advice of a student TV
critic - particularly since the midseason
premiere garnered record ratings - there
may well be more in store for the "Jersey
Shore" crew. All I can do is wait for the
demise of what is quite possibly the worst
reality TV show of all time.

We all secretly wish we
were The Situation
By Alexander Russ
Daily Arts Writer
With the MTV reality hit "Jersey
Shore" returning for the remainder of
its second season, some of us might find
ourselves asking, "Why?" Why would
MTV want to follow around a group of ,
muscled-up, gelled-out people from New
Jersey who do nothing but go out every
night and make fools of themselves for all
the world to see?
Well, to be blunt, because it's down-
right hilarious.
"Jersey Shore" stars like Ronnie and
Snooki are the type of people most of us
hope we never become, but love to watch
in action every week. Let's be honest:
People like the ridiculous. There's little to
no enjoyment in watching agroup of "nor-
mal" people go about their everyday lives. Vinny peed.
On the flipside, there is an abundance of
enjoyment to be had from watching Snoo- self - or in other words, go out, raise hell
ki get punched in the face at a bar, Ronnie and party your ass off - wouldn't it be
repeatedly get blackout drunk and cheat pretty hard to say no? Even though many
on his girlfriend, Sammi "Sweetheart," or people often look on these characters
better yet, Mike "The Situation" extract with sheer disgust, there's a reason that
the two cuter-looking girls he picked up at "Jersey Shore" has so many viewers in the
the bar from his room, while leaving the young adult crowd - 6.5 million of them
"grenade" (in other words, an ugly girl ina tuned in for the current premiere. Getting
group of hotties) to sleep alone. Just about paid exorbitant amounts of money to go
all of the behavior these people exhibit on out and party is the college version of the
the show would be morally questionable, American Dream. Let's not pretend that
but the fact of the matter is that it's funny you would rather go out into the world
to watch. and earn your living "the honest way."
If a TV producer ever approached you For us college students, this would be
and asked if you would like to star in a the life. "Jersey Shore" is a glimpse into
show where all you have to do is be your- the ridiculous fantasy that partying more

will only get you more money and success
in life. If only it were true ...
You can love or hate these people all
you want. You can criticize them for rein-
forcing stereotypes about the Italian-
American community, or setting horrific
examples of how someone should act in
any given situation. But it can't be denied
that they are funny. And as long as they
continue to make themselves look like
idiots (albeit idiots with great tans),;they
will continue to make more money and
receive more views from kids like us,
thankful that we are not like them, but
wishing somewhere in the back of our
minds that we were.


Smith Westerns all
riffs, no substance

No, I don't know any Coldplay songs."
' kountry is just wrong

By BEN VERDI
Daily Arts Wrtier
"Country Strong" has no protagonist,
no conflict and no discernible storyline.
Garrett Hedlund gives perhaps the
best performance in "Country Strong,"
directed by Shana Feste
("The Greatest"). And,
despite his recent blitz
of the big screen in cOUn
"TRON: Legacy" and
now this film, despite Strong
his curious casting as At Quality16
Dean Moriarty in an and Rave
upcoming film adapta-
tion of Jack Kerouac's Screen Gems
novel, "On The Road,"
Hedlund just isn't a very good actor.
Nor, anymore, is Gwyneth Paltrow
("Iron Man 2"). Paltrow plays Kelly Can-
ter, who is billed as this film's main char-
acter, but is really its main distraction.
Tim McGraw ("The Blind Side"), who
plays James Canter (Kelly's husband), is
definitely not the film's protagonist, but
he's most respectable character of the
bunch - if only because someone has to
be. That is, while all the other characters
either cheat on their significant others or
abuse alcohol, drugs or their fans, James
Canter only hints at doing these things.
The only major mistake Canter makes

is ripping his country star wife out of
rehab too early and forcing her into a
tour she doesn't want to do, which ruins
everything about her life that she hadn't
already destroyed.
But movies overcome the fact that they
don't center around one protagonist, hero
or anti-hero all the time. So why is "Coun-
try Strong" such a steaming pile of shit?
Well, in addition to not having a character
worth caring about, this film doesn't have
a plot.
Yes, films can get by without having
clear, central narratives too, but not when
they don't have a main character for us. A
film needs to have at least one of those two
fundamental things: a plot, or an engross-
ing main character to follow while he or
she meanders around the world. A movie
can't be missing both of these things and
be considered good.
It's like football. You have to be able
to run well or pass well to win a football
game. If you can do both, you're in good
shape. And while you can get away with
only being good at one aspect of the game,
if you can't do either you've just got to
punt.
And this movie is a punt that gets
blocked and returned for a touchdown.
The viewer is almost left with no choice
but to hate "Country Strong" because of
how little it seems to care about itself.

Paltrow cries, Hedlund stares pensively
out the window and McGraw does all he
can to subtly deliver his cheesy lines in
every scene.
A small saving grace for the film is
its inclusion of "Gossip Girl" 's Leighton
Meester, who plays an up-and-coming
country singer who's supposed to some-
how inform our understanding of the
initial innocence of Kelly Canter's trou-
bled life as a famous person. All Meester
ends up doing, however, is lip-syncing,
looking hot and sounding stupid. But
at least watching her have sex isn't as
uncomfortable as watching Paltrow, or
any other lady your mom's age, do the
same.
First Glee,' now this
stop it, Gwyneth.
"Country Strong" promises to turn
more people away from country music
than any film in recent memory. There
aren't enough jokes to consider it a com-
edy, enough genuine emotions to make
it a drama or enough words to describe
how much you'll hate yourself for paying
to see it.

By DAVID RIVA
DailyArts Writer
A good guitar riff can go a long way.
Just ask Jimmy Page orKeith Richards.
A sizable portion of the most celebrated
songs in the history
of rock'n'roll are not **
remembered for their
vocal performance, Smjth
bassline or drumbeat. W M
Rather, a single repeated
chord progression laid Dye It Blonde
down by the proverbial Fat Possum
axeman has the ability '
to worm its way into a
listener's subconscious unlike any other
musical phenomenon. Chicago-based
Smith Westerns has taken this theory and
beaten it to death on its sophomore effort
Dye It Blonde.
Guitarist Max Kakacek presents riff
after riff at a maximum decibel level with
a moderately tamed sense of hyperactiv-
ity. To be fair, a good portion of these gui-
tar parts are compelling enough to make
the listener take notice. But when the
barely audible lead signer Cullen Omori
pipes in - sporting a slacker noncha-
lance contrary to the massively ambitious
soundscapes accompanying him - it's dif-
ficult to hear the song without noting its
obvious sonic imbalance.
Take opener "Weekend," for instance.
Some serious shredding occurs during the
first 30 seconds of the track, only to be let
down by Omori, who stumbles in to contrib-
ute his two cents about crying girls. "End of
the Night" and "Dye the World" follow suit
in almost identical form, differing only triv-
ially in their subject matter, which ranges
from talesoftakinggirlsoutonweekends to
descriptions of smiling girls.
On "All Die Young," the amp is final-
ly turned down and some ivory relief is
plunked out on the keys - appropriate for
a song title that differs only slightly from a
Billy Joel classic. Although the vocals final-
ly fit the musical mold, it becomes painfully
clear that Omori's whiny crooning wouldn't
sound pleasing regardless of the caliber of
his backing band.
This isn't the only example of idol wor-
ship on the record, however. The wistful
nostalgia of "Still New" sounds as if it's
going to break out into the chorus of Mott
the Hoople's "All the Young Dudes" at any
moment. Unfortunately, it never does and

the potential for a moving sing-along proves
to be false hope as the tune teases with yet
another unfulfilled guitar riff.
Lyrically, Dye It Blonde is almost crimi-
nally juvenile, in a distinctly non-endear-
ing manner. Granted, most of the band
members are not far removed from their
high school years (their ages range 18 to
20), but lines like "The look in your eyes /
makes me want to die / You're not the girl
I used to know" and "Weekends are never
fun / unless you're around here" are inex-
cusably childish.
We didn't like 'Dye
It Blonde. We also
don't like blondes.
Go figure.
The reason fellow slacker rockers like
Girls or forefathers like Pavement can
get away with such lackluster and under-
whelming vocal performances is because
the music meets them halfway and doesn't
overpower their meager abilities. on the
other hand, fellow riff rockers like The
Black Keys have succeeded in continuous-
ly looping guitar lines because their lead
singer rises to the occasion that the deter-
mined progressions pose. Even though
Smith Westerns has one piece of the puz-
zle in the genuinely gifted Kakacek, its
inability to find the other pieces and pro-
ceed to connect them properly will inhibit
them from progressing as a band.

of the 49ers. Les Miles was a done
deal as late as two nights ago (I'm
looking at you, Joe Schad).
When the Big Lead "broke" the
story that Harbaugh-to-Michigan
had fallen apart, the incessant

bragging about the scoop was
annoying but understandable: It
was the one time throughoutthe
whole thingthat someone got
something undeniably right about
the whole mad tragicomedy.
Through all the unnamed sourc-
es and flight trackers, through the
baseless speculation by reporters
and yahoos alike, we all learned
one thing:
We don't know anything.
And you know what? I'm OK
with it. And I hope, for your sake,
that you are too.
A common takeaway from the
search: "Michigan isn't the job we
think it is." I was one of the loud-
est supporters of this theory. And
maybe it's true. But afterthinking
about it, that's not something you
can infer from this search.
- Sure, it appeared that Harbaugh
spurned Michigan. He was the
obvious first choice, right? But how
much do we know about the talks
between Brandon and Harbaugh?
Not much. In fact, nothing. We
don't know freaking anything

about them.
And Les Miles? We're still
unsure about who spurned
whom in that situation, but it's
really impossible to say. ESPN's Joe
Schad reported Miles turned down
an offer. Brandon claims he didn't
offer Harbaugh or Miles. And on
and on.
What if Brady Hoke was Bran-
don's guy the whole time? What if
Brandon was simply humoring the
fan base bytalking to Harbaugh
and Miles? It's certainly a pos-
sibility. In fact, that was one of the
early reports at the beginning of
the search (from FOX2, but still).
if that's true, doesn't it mean that
Michigan was the picky one in this
situation?
But once again, we have no idea.
So now it's Hoke. And guess
what? We don't know anything
about him, either.
We know he turned around a
Ball State program that was in
shambles - and it took him five
years (four, if you count 7-6 - but
our head coach was just fired for

that record, so...). He went 9-4 his
second year at San Diego State
and 4-8 his first year. He coached
under former Michigan coach
Lloyd Carr, who went 1-5 against
Ohio State coach Jim Tressel. So
what can we reasonably expect?
Again, who knows.
Here's my humble plea to Wol-
verine nation: You don't know any-
thing, so just accept that and throw
your supportbehind this guy.
Try to forget about how botched
you believe this search was, how
close Michigan was to landing
Harbaugh - who suddenly became
the greatest coach in football over
the past two weeks - and how
underwhelmed you are with Brady
Hoke's name.
Michigan fans focused on all
the negatives once already and
look what that yielded. Embrace
the unknown instead of fearing it.
After all, you know whatthey say.
Ignorance is bliss.

players already," redshirt fresh-
man forward Jordan Morgan
said. "We need to approach it the
same way, as a team. Not just one-
on-one matchups. We just have to
shift our whole defense towards
some of their better players."
The Wolverines intend to alter-
nate between 1-3-1 zone and a
man-to-man defensive schemes
throughout the game. By dealing
out different looks on defense,
Michigan coach John Beilein
plans to limit what the Buckeyes
can do with their size advantage.
"Whatever (defense) is getting
stops, works," junior guard Zack
Novak said. "I think mixing it
up is good because it doesn't let
teams get into rhythm. I know
that when teams mix it up against
us, I guess it just messes with you
a little bit. You can't really get into
(a) flow mentally."
But slowing down Ohio State's
post game isn't the Wolverines'
only concern. The Buckeyes boast
some of the best perimeter play
in the conference. Senior guards
Jon Diebler and David Lighty are
shooting a combined 49 percent
from 3-point range.

"Lighty has improved every
year because he is an athlete,"
Beilein said. "He is a football play-
er, a two sport athlete. He is phys-
ical, he gets to the basket. They'll
isolate him a lot on our guys and
just try to get him to the foul line.
And when you coach against a kid
for four years, you just see that
3-pointer climb ... He had a huge
one against Minnesota (on Sun-
day). He can do so many different
things."
Though there are new players
on the rise for the Buckeyes, they
are a similar team to the one the
Wolverines contested three times
last year. Michigan's experience
in previous games with Ohio State
will serve as a blueprint for what
needs to be done on Wednesday.
"If you look at them last year
we played them in six halves,"
Beilein said. "I think we won four
of the six halves but we lost two
of the three games. So we need to
make sure that we put two halves
together ... We have to keep it con-
sistent so that we have a chance
to win. We can't continue to get
these double digit deficits and
come back to win, it's really hard."

Freshman phenom Sullinger will be a handful for Blue

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
DailySportsEditor
Don't let his number fool you.
He may wear No. 0, but fresh-
man Jared Sullinger is anything
but nil for the undefeated Ohio
State men's basketball team.
The 6-foot-9 forward has
quickly made a name for himself,
not only on the Buckeye roster,
but nationally. Last week, Sull-
inger was named to the John R.
Wooden Award Midseason Top-
30 list - just one of two freshmen
mentioned.
But recently, his efforts have
been focused on the Big Ten,
where he has led the Buckeyes

to a 3-0 start in conference play.
Coaches and players around the
conference knew about Sull-
inger's dominance before the sea-
son began - he has been named
the Big Ten Player of the week, or
Freshman of the week, in eight of
the nine weeks so far this season.
"He's above his age level as far
as strength," Wisconsin coach Bo
Ryan said in a teleconference on
Monday. "Sullinger, physically,
was ready. He obviously listens,
he obviously does what's best for
the team. You can see that he posi-
tions well. You can see he's not
just a talented player, but he's a
skilled, talented player. He's a dif-
ference maker."

Entering the Buckeyes' match-
up with the Wolverines, he
remains the dominant force for
Ohio State. He leads the team in
points (17.9) and rebounds (10.3)
per game. All the while shooting
nearly 59 percent from the floor,
second on the team only to senior
forward Dallas Lauderdale.
But in three Big Ten games for
the Buckeyes, Sullinger's numbers
have improved to 19 points and 11
rebounds per game. He has eight
double-doubles on the season and
is a brute force on the glass. His
shear size makes him a force to be
reckoned with, but he has surpris-
ingly light hands for a post player.
His impressive numbers as a

first-year player under Ohio State
coach Thad Matta shouldn't sur-
prise anyone.
As a senior at Northland High
School in Columbus, Sullinger
averaged 24.5 points and 12.3
rebounds a game. But even more
impressively, he shot 78 percent
from the floor.
That same year he was named a
McDonald's All-American, a high
school Naismith Award winner
and Parade Magazine's Player of
the Year.
"He had signs in preseason
workouts where he was very dom-
inant," Matta said. "I remember
watching him in the quarterfinals
of the National AAU Tournament

in Orlando and he had 28 (points)
and 19 (rebounds). And I'm like,
'No, he can't play any better in
the semifinals.' Then he got 32
(points) and 20 (rebounds) and
I'm like, 'He can't play any bet-
ter.' And then he went into the
Championship game and had like
36 (points) and 22 (rebounds) or
something."
In a video posted by the Ohio
State Athletic Department on
Tuesday, Sullinger expressed
his excitement to play in his first
rivalry game as a Buckeye.
Having grown up in Columbus
he said he experienced it, but he's
looking forward to doing so as a
player.

"It's always going to be a rival-
ry," Sullinger said. "It's always
going to be bad blood between
Ohio State and Michigan and
you've just gotta enjoy it ... Some
sports, like us, you get (to play
Michigan) six or seven or eight
times in your four years here. So
you've just got to enjoy playing
against Michigan."
It remains unseen whether or
not Sullinger will see more rivalry
games outside of this season. Ohio
State is notorious for sending
freshmen to the NBA - with five
in the past four years.
But for this season, Michigan
has about 280 pounds of No. 0 on
its hands.

VIRAL VICTIM OR VL LIA N?
BY H E E A F F
MAG:SA BIN CR A
BY MA RISSA MCCLAIN

A s a sfrequent visitor of the infor-
mation superhighway, I have
become quite familiar with
what will garner a response from my
fellow Internet junkies. Whether it
involves uploading drunken or embar-
rassing text messages or cute cats with
idiosyncratic captions, when it comes
to the Internet, the more preposterous
or nonsensical, the better. In my years
of scanning the web for new curi-
osities, I couldn't help but wonder if I
could do it myself. So taking a cue from
blogs that had already reached Inter-
net fame, I decided to put my hubris to
the test by creating a blog of my own.
I approached the endeavor as field
research. I wanted to see a side of
the web that I was unfamiliar with -
authorship. My initial goal was to get
1,000 page views to become famous.
With this goal in mind I wanted to
make sure to focus my blog on some-
thing that would appeal to the masses.
There are three things that the Inter-
netcommunity loves: irony, humor and
things that are cute. My blog would
have all three qualities by showcasing
infants in unusual hats accompanied
by socially relevant, but frequently
controversial captions. With this
brilliant concept in mind, I created

get. These unbudgeted costs have been
a main deterrent for the University to
employ a student with a disability.
Kolbe said she was excluded from
a summer research job because her
accommodation would have been too
expensive for the University. Other
GSIs have had similar experiences.
But creating a centralized accom-
modation fund would remedy the
situation and result in more job oppor-
tunities for those with disabilities.
GEO also wants the University to
implement a standardized process
that explains to graduate students
where they should go if they need
accommodations. Additionally, GEO
desires a system that makes it easy
to advocate for resources for the dis-
abled.
Increasingthe number of semesters
in which graduate students can stay
enrolled is also important, since peo-

BabiesInCrazyHats.blogspot.com.
My blog is classified in the blogo-
sphere asa single-serving site - a page
that serves a single, usually inane pur-
pose, and really, what could be more
inconsequential than babies in crazy
hats? The blog's creation was a simple
10-minute procedure. I made a user-
name, a URL, uploaded photos and just
like that I had my own web-identity
with no fees to pay and no questions
asked. My first two posts involved chil-
dren in hand-knit, multicolored hats
that were described as, "real cute" and
"slightly less cute." As I uploaded more
photos the captions got more obscure
and unrefined. I began using pop cul-
ture references and Internet memes in
order to make readers who are "in the
know" feel likethey are apart of a small
community with an inside joke.
When my content was developed
enough, I started going viral. I encour-
aged all of my friends to post a link to
my website on their Facebook pages
and sent my URL to other well-known
pop culture blogs urging them to fea-
ture my site. Within minutes my site
was sent to friends, their friends, their
friends' friends and so on, to the point
where complete strangers were soon
posting my site on their Twitter and
ple with disabilities have to interpret
their course load in a different way.
GEO is pushing for language about
accommodations for students with
disabilities tobe included in the letter
that graduate students receive upon
acceptance to the GSI program so that
potential graduate students are aware
that they can seek assistance.
Lastly, since some students may
feel uncomfortable disclosing their
disabilities, GEO is striving for a rule
that allows disabilities to remain
unannounced to the departmental
supervisor. Right now, there is no offi-
cial policy, but the current procedure
forces GSIs to reveal their physical or
mental limitation.
Above all, GEO hopes to change the
way GSIs with disabilities are per-
ceived.
"You're oftentimes seen as a prob-
lem person, as opposed to a person that
really has something to bring,"Wernick
said. "It feels like people with disabili-
ties within academia are justbarely tol-
erated."

onslaught of unwelcome critique was
to fight back. I wanted to contact each
naysayer individually and explain that
my intentions were not to decimate

wanted them to accept my dark humor

As soon as the army of opinionated

convincing them otherwise.

THEJUNKDRAWER
random student intervieW by jordan rochelson

Welcome to the random
student interview where
we accost and humiliate
a poor student. This week's victim:
Jim. What are you studying?
Environment and political science.
Meaning you want to be a...
I wantcto go into a public'policy school
and eventually run for an elected
office in my lifetime.
OK, so you have no interest in mak-
ing money.
Pretty much.
What's the highest aspiration for
you ... the oval office?
I'd like to havea seat on the congress;
that's aiming really high. A state sen-
ate office would be really nice.
Do you belong to MSA?
No, I do not.
So who do you think you are?
Well I'm going to graduate school for
public policy.
Where?
Hopefully Indiana, I haven't gotten
my acceptance yet, but I've applied.
Is that a good school?
It's the third best public policy school
in the country.
What are the top two?
Shoot, I don't remember.
Is thatbecauseyougot rejected and
you are rationalizing?
No, Indiana specializes in environ-
ment so that's why I want to go there.

If you say so. How do you feel about
how Obama is doing?
You know, I agree with him on a lot of
things, I disagree with him on a lot of
things. I'd sayoverall, I disagree with
him.
Did you vote for him?
This is embarrassing, butI didn't vote.
You didn't vote? And you're run-
ning for public office?
Isn't that sad?
What is your experience with GSIs
here at this prestigious University?
Depends on the GSI you get.
Have you ever had one who doesn't
speak English?
Yes.
Does that frustrate you?
Oh my God ... my Calc II GSI, (name
retracted). Couldn't stand him. I
could not understand a word that guy
said.
Have you everbeen accused of
being racist?
Have I ever been?
Just because he doesn't speak Eng-
lish, his name has to be foreign?
That was his name!.
Sure it was. Have you ever had a
really attractive GSI?
Yes, I have one now actually.
What did she teach? Or he?
Or he (laughs), that's fair. She teaches
Environ 201.
Have you ever had something with

her?
No.
It's completely not off the record.
Well, this is just starting, so I'm going
to be working on itI guess.
Is that one of your goals?
You're just trapping me into questions.
Do you think it's less unethical to
sleep with a GSI than it is to sleep
with a professor?
Yes, because they are students just like
you. I don't think that's unethical.
Would yoube upset if you didn't get
an A?
A little bit.
Would you see it as a reflection of
your prowess?
It would be after the class.
Oh, so after you get your grade you
say: Would you like to get some
dinner, or sleep with me?
Exactly.
What's your favorite thing that
people serve in the front of Angell
hall?
I never get any of the stuff here
because you have to sign up for the
e-mail list which I don't like doing.
Wow, God forbid you commit to
something. Vote for (lastname
retracted) in 2016. Do you agree
with the stereotype that vegetar-
ians are better people?
That's not necessarily a stereotype.
Do you think it's the truth?

Well I see the benefit of vegetariansim
because I'm an environment major. I'd
do it too, if I didn't like meat so much.
You kill thingsfor consumption and
they don't. So they are notbetter
than you?
Ithink part of the benefits of the food
chain is that we're on top and morality
shouldn't play into that per say.
Are you ina fraternity?
Yes.
How do you feel about it?
I like it, it's a good group of guys.
What about the ladies that you guys
get to meet?
Um ... I'm not going to comment on the
quality of ladies.
It canbe totally not off the record.
I'm still not going to comment.
Any potential wives?
Yeah, a brother that just graduated is
now engaged.
Mazel tov. Are you going to go to
the wedding?
We weren't that good of friends.
Anything to say about Rich Rod?
I just want us to get a coach and be
done with it.
Do you think I canbe a "Michigan
Man?"
You're a bit small tobea Michigan
coach. I like my coaches to be a bit
bigger.

tofu, Jerusalem Garden on South 5th Avenue serves a falafel
and hummus sandwich and Sadako on South University Avenue
offers a vegetable roll and miso soup. A vegan sweet tooth can be
fixed at Silvio's Organic Pizza on North University Avenue with
its vegan cheesecake, chocolate mousse and cookies.
Though most of Ann Arbor is fairly conducive to the veggie
lifestyle, not every restaurant complies. For vegan restaurant
goers, variety and complexity of vegan-friendly options is key in
makinga restaurant attractive.
"At a restaurant, I like to have a meal that doesn't just take out
the meat but replaces it with something like tofu or tempeh,"
De Carolis said. "That's why I like Noodles & Co. because I can
get spaghetti with tofu in it, not just noodles with no protein
source."
Vegetarians and vegans who rely on the dining halls and other
campus eateries as a food source aren't always as fortunate. The
options available within University Unions are generally a meat-
fest, with fast food restaurants like Wendy's and Panda Express
dominating the choices. Most vegan and vegetarian students
also concur that the meat-free options available at the majority
of dining halls are mediocre at best.
"I found the options available in the dining halls limited,
and the options that were available were kind of gross," said De
Carolis, who lived in South Quad Residence Hall as a freshman.
"During lunch they always had this cold tofu available which,
after a while, you don't have any variety with - you can't do
anything but put it on some rice with soy sauce."
Many students are discouraged by the unappetizing appear-
ance of vegetarian and vegan options, which cause non-vegetari-
ans to scoff at those who eat the dining halls' vegetarian options.
"I think I'm the only vegetarian my friends know, so (in the
dining hall) they'd be like, 'that's so gross, why do you eat that?'
" De Carolis said. "It gave them the impression that being a
vegetarian makes you a very narrow person in terms of what you

can eat.
"Now I live with them, so they understand there are more op-
tions. But if that's the only food non-vegetarians see, it's a very
narrow impression of what being a vegetarian is."
LSA junior Lauren Morrison believes common misconcep-
tions about vegetarianism and veganism hold back the Univer-
sity and its students from trying animal-free diet.
"There is a belief that it's more expensive to have vegan op-
tions, but that's usually not the case," Morrison said. "I think
more options in the dining halls would encourage people to eat
healthier and to consider veganism as not this super weird way
to live, but as something that's normalized and healthier."
However, University alum Rodolfo Palma, who worked for the
University for seven years, has noticed changes for the better in
on campus vegan dining from his time as an undergraduate.
Palma lives in Ann Arbor with his two children and wife, all
of whom are vegan, and he would occasionally eat in the dining
hall as a University employee. Like most vegetarians, his resi-
dence hall of choice is East Quad Residence Hall. The selection
vegetarian-friendly dishes is new since his time here at the
University.
"When I was a student first eating in the dorms, I remember
the one thing I could always have was pasta," Palma said. "And
now, when I was eating in East Quad a lot as a staff member, the
food was just amazing - I was surprised."
Palma explained that as an active member of the Michigan
Animal Rights Society as a student, there was a large push for
labeling vegan food in the dining halls and having more vegan
options.
While he admits what he ate as a staff member in East Quad
wasn't exactly gourmet, he was delighted by the diversity and
availability of options - something he and MARS fought for.
Varilone has organized recent efforts with MARS to encour-
age students who may not be vegan or vegetarian to support the

meatless options available in the residence halls. Last winter,
Varilone and MARS orchestrated a program with East Quad
called "Meatless Mondays" to reinforce their cause.
On Mondays, MARS set up a table outside the East Quad Din-
ing Hall and informed students of the benefits of a plant-based
diet and the dining options available.
"We tried to coordinate 'Meatless Mondays' with specific
menu options that were vegan that we thought students would
find especially good or appetizing," he said.
Some vegans are also finding choices in the dining halls out-
side of East Quad. Engineering junior Samantha Luber switched
to a vegan lifestyle and saw the dining halls as a resource.
"Because there are such good vegan availabilities at the din-
ing halls, it has actually given me different ideas of what I can be
eating," she said. "When I first came to school I brought a lot of
canned food and granola bars because I wasn't really sure what
to expect in terms of availability for vegan food ... But then, I
found that a lot of the places are really helpful in making salads
and other things of that nature that are vegan."
Palma explained that an apprehension toward vegan food
stems solely from labeling the items as such - therefore making
omnivores assume because it's labeled vegan, the food is "for-
eign or different."
"We were in charge of getting dessert for Christmas dinner,"
Palma said. "We got these pies which happened to be vegan,
which happened to be the Meijer brand apple and blueberry
pies. (My nephews) refused to eat the pie that they would nor-
mally eat because it happened to be vegan."
Palma noted that much of the food omnivores eat is already
vegan, it's just not marketed as such.
"Vegetarianism is not the lifestyle that a lot of people think of,"
De Carolis said. "People think of really granola-hippie people that
don't want to eat meat. But I'm completely normal - at least I
think so - it's just a lifestyle choice I happen to believe in."

Less than 3 percent of Americans keep a vegetarian or vegan diet. Because
the vegetarian and vegan population is a small minority, members claim
they're often misunderstood by meat lovers.
All over the country, it's up to vegetarians and vegans to do their homework
to find where they can eat in public. But in a progressive city like Ann Arbor -
whose reputation is built on the liberal persona of townies and students bashing
with hash and frequenting farmer's markets - it would seem that the veggie-
movement would be at the forefront of the University and city's dining scene.

But if the city and the University were to duke it out for the
gold medal in veggie-friendliness, it appears that Ann Arbor
takes home first prize.
Ann Arbor is home to three exclusively vegetarian restau-
rants with many places having vegetarian-friendly options tobe
enjoyed by herbivores and omnivores alike.
- University alum Ananth Pullela recently opened Jazzy Veg-
gie, the most recent all-vegan eatery on Main Street.
"My vision was always meant to make this a very mainstream,
fast, casual eatery - not a very upscale vegetarian dining experi-
ence with pricey food," he said. "I wanted this to be a place
where people could just grab a bite - a burger or a pizza - it
just so happens that it's all plant-based."
Pullela, a lifelong vegetarian, explained he was disheartened
about vegetarian food options after moving to America.
"When I first came to this country, I had to temporarily eat
meat because I was kind of starving," he said. "You go to Mc-
Donald's, and you can't get anything else."
Pullela wanted to create a restaurant where people could find

a variety of options - sans animal fat and cholesterol - allun-
derneath one roof. As a former University student and resident
of Ann Arbor, he knew there was a vegetarian population here
to cater to.
"There aren't many choices out there, especially for vegans,"
he said. "So here, people can come to eat in groups - omnivores,
vegetarians, vegans - and find something for everybody."
Jazzy Veggie makes all of its pizza crust, sauces and dress-
ings from scratch, uses Zingerman's Delicatessen bread for
sandwiches and capitalizes on the variety of vegetable-based
proteins available to create a menu of familiar, American food.
His trademark lies within the flavorful twist he specializes for
each dish..
"The ingredients are all gourmet," he said. "I wanted to bring
all the flavors and sauces traditionally associated with meat
options to the vegetarian side. This is not your average veggie
burger - a patty thrown on a bun with some greens, tomato and
ketchup. A lot of ingredients go into it."
Pullela emphasized that though he and his restaurant choose

to avoid animal products, he isn't running an anti-meat campaign.
"Different people have different lifestyle choices," he said.
"I'm not advocating veganism or vegetarianism here. I'm just
offering food that's flavorful for everybody.
"We're not offering 'vegan' food - it's good food. That's how
I like to be seen."
For some vegan and vegetarian students at the University,
like Public Policy junior Joe Varilone, living in Ann Arbor has
gone beyond simply supporting a distinct lifestyle choice: It has
brought other ethical food questions to the forefront - espe-
cially as it relates to the environment.
"Living in Ann Arbor and talking to people, I think it has af-
fected other ways eat besides just beingvegan," said Varilone,
who is also the president of the Michigan Animal Rights Society.
"It has definitely made me aware of issues in organic agriculture
versus the use of synthetic fertilizers and herbicides, pesticides
and insecticides."
Varilone's top picks for vegan cuisine are Big Ten Burrito for
its vegetarian rice and bean burrito and Raja Rani for its channa
masala stocked with chick peas - two dishes rich in protein,
which is a must for Varilone when eating out.
LSA junior Lyndsay De Carolis, a vegetarian, prefers Chipotle
for her black bean fix because the restaurant uses local vegeta-
bles and organic beans whenever possible.
Other popular choices among vegan students: Seva Restau-
rant on East Liberty Street, an all-vegetarian restaurant, Sava's
State Street Cafe which offers three types of veggie burgers and
Mia Za's on East University Avenue which provides pasta and
salad choices that are generally vegetarian or easily modified.
Most ethnic restaurants around the city and campus are also
vegan-friendly, nutritious and affordable.
Earthen Jar offers an all-vegetarian Indian buffet, No Thai's
menu, with locations on South University Avenue, North 4th Av-
enue and Plymouth Road, includes noodle or stir-fry dishes with

Rnee Echols is completely blind. She has

a seeing-eye dog to navigate the University's
campus. She's also a GSI. Her stories of
struggle with the current administrative
system are extensive. In her first semesters

asked her department supervisor for an aide
to assist her with students the classroom, but her,
request was ignored.

dents must complete their coursework in 10
semesters or fewer.
Kolbe said there are many logistical issues that
also affect her experience as a GSI. Since there is
no flashing light in her office in Haven Hall, she
never knows when thefire alarm is sounding.
"It's not like Haven Hall hasn't burned down
before. It has," Kolbe said.
She said the department tried to remedy this
situation by having the fire captains come and get
her in case of a fire. However, the building's fire
captains leave their office at Sp.m., and most GSIs
work past regular office hours.
Mandatory meetings, like the sexual harass-
ment workshops, are difficult for Kolbe to attend
because accommodations are usually not provid-
ed.
"There should be a central person that you go
to. There should be an office for employees with
disabilities instead of me having to send out 50
e-mails to coordinate a meeting I only have to
attend once," she said.
The biggest problem Kolbe faces is that admin-
istrators and professors don't exactly understand
her disability. Sometimes their discomfort with
her situation is palpable, or they forget Kolbe has
complete hearing loss because she doesn't have a
"deaf accent."
"Sometimes other students, even in my cohort,
have been a little uncomfortable because a disabil-
ity is kind of new to people," Kolbe explained.
Kolbe has had professors hold personalmeet-
ings with her to test the extent of her hearing loss.
One professor actually covered her mouth and
spoke to see if Kolbe could hear. Because of Kolbe's
deafness, she couldn't hear and found the "test"
extremely insulting.
But Kolbe has learned to deal with reactions to
her disability in the teaching and learning arena in
her own way. Kolbe picks up expressions and body
language to gauge how loud or soft she is talking,
or even if her voice is too shrill.
Focusing on the issue
Laura Wernick, a former GSI, is pursuing her
post-doctorate education. Her disability is invis-
ible.
Wernick has Attention Deficit Disorder and a
learning disability that make it hard to be recog-

nized as-a student and professional in need of spe-
cific accommodations.
She said the University fails to consider gradu-
ate students with disabilities as employees or pro-
fessionals.
"We are doing academic work here, and the
issues are actually institutional," Wernick said.
"I think it's important to take a step back and see
this as more systemic within the larger issue of
academia."
The stigma regarding people with learning dis-
abilities is potent, Wernick says.
Wernick feels thather disability is often ignored
or perceived as an excuse not to work. She said
often people don't understand that students with
invisible disabilities also need accommodations.
In her pursuit for a faculty position after her
graduate student program, Wernick has had a
hard time trying to inform people that having
a learning disability sometimes prevents adults
from practicing traditional methods of teaching.
Because people with disabilities are considered an
expensive burden, an academic career is hard to
pursue when accommodations are necessary.
"The struggle then becomes how you advocate
for what you need without then creating a reputa-
tion at the University as somebody who is a bur-
den," Wernick said.
Wernick finds ways to work around her disabili-
ty; she scans her textbooks to her computer so that
it can read them aloud to her. During her gradu-
ate studies at the University, her textbooks were
scanned halfway into the semester only after con-
stant inquiries. This prevented her from receiving
a learning experience equal to other students.
Because of her disability, Wernick had to grap-
ple with the issue of teaching a class when she has
a hard time writing on the board in front of the
class. Her learning disability results ina difficulty
thinking and writing at the same time. When she
wrote on the board, most of her words were mis-
spelled. Wernick also could not teach and be a stu-
dent at the same time, which made it take much
longer to complete her program.
Wernick said institutional factors prevent peo-
ple from coping with their situations.
"I don't think the system is set up at all for
people with disabilities. That interface isn't neces-
sarily an easy interface, it is not a typical student
experience."

The incident inspired her to become an active
member in the University's Graduate Employee
Organization - a labor union that has lobbied for
GSI rights since 1976. Echols is now the lead nego-
tiator for the organization and is an extremely
active member in contract bargaining processes
with the University.
Teaching a room full of undergraduate students
can be a daunting responsibility for a graduate stu-
dent, but that task can become evenmore ofachal-
lenge for a GSI with a disability.
Currently, GSIs with disabilities don't know to
address issues concerning their disability with the
University administration. This is a problem that
has come on the radar within the last two or three
years and has led to a partnership of disabled GSIs
and GEO.
Echols, who attends the bargaining meeting
with University representatives every week, said
there has been a more concerted effort in the last
few years to figure out what problems disabled
GSIs are facing.
"This is something organized labor has not
taken on before," Echols said. "To understand job
accommodations as a right is a fairly new concept."
Echols said because the GEO is such a strong
union, it has been using its power to focus on social
justice issues, not just financial parity issues.
Echols calls GEO's disability concerns "ground-
breaking" and "historic" because no other union is
tacklingsuch topics.
GEO President Rob Gillezeau also expressed
pride in the organization's actions.
"In a lot of unions, it wouldn't come to the fore-
front of their bargaining platform just because it
doesn't affect most people," Gillezeau said. "But
GEO is different from a lot of union locals ... dis-
ability access has been at the top or very near to
the top of our priority issues.
"When I taught, I understood exactly what to
do when a student had a disability, I knew the pro-
cess. If I had a disability, I would have no idea what

to do."
GEO's main concern is equal treatment for
people of all identities, especially those with dis-
abilities. Other issues include providing female
GSIs with a longer paid leave of absence during
and after pregnancy. Receiving adequate child-
care subsidies is a constant struggle for GSIs, as
the University is always concerned about the cost
of these accommodations.
Another issue GEO hopes to resolve is graduate
student research assistants' eligibility for union
membership. If they were eligible to join, GEO
would double its representation by gaining twice
as many members.
Looking for solutions
Echols's first attempt to verbally contact her
departmental supervisor left her with unsatisfac-
tory answers on how to address her need of an
aide to assist her in the classroom. The University
told her that her accommodation would simply be
too costly and such an addition would undermine
her authority in the classroom. The situation left
Echols feeling frustrated and disrespected.
In the required 100-level English classes, GSIs
must design their own course; they don't rely on
a professor's lecture for teaching material. In
Echols's freshman English classes, students were
disorderly - they blatantly passed notes, left dur-
ing class, used their cell phones openly and even
napped at their desk.
Her experience teaching English 124 and 125
was disheartening. Echols didn't know how she
could adequately teach when her students had no
respect for her and her disability.
Her second attempt for an aide consisted of
drafting a formal letter to the University with help
from the GEO, and after weeks with no reply, the
University said she should talk to other instructors
with vision impairment to see how they handled
their situation. This obstacle eventually forced

Echols to leave lower-level English classes and
begin assisting as a GSI for Great Books, which
had a reputation for having more disciplined stu-
dents.
In order to grade exams, Echols needs her stu-
dents' Blue Books to be read aloud to her. Profes-
sors often offer to read the exams to her, but when
professors don't offer, Echols is forced to ask her
fellow GSIs for help.
"I'm stuck in this awkward situation where I
have to ask the other GSIs to read me exams, and
that's just more work for them," Echols said.
She believes the University should make an
effort to actively recruit and consider employees
with disabilities. But first, the University needs to
make its current disabled employees feel welcome.
"What we are asking is that the University puts
such processes into place so that employees with
disabilities are able to ask for and get the accom-
modations they need," Echols said. "We are sure
that our proposals are coming up with some good
solutions to the problem, and we hope that the
University seriously considers them."
Hearing the problem
Athena Kolbe is a third-year joint political sci-
ence and School of Social Work GSI, who is cur-
rently teaching Political Science 160.
Kolbe has a hearing impairment. She can read
lips, but feels limited when teaching in a group set-
ting because she can't read multiple people when
they're talking at the same time. She requires the
assistance of a CART, or a Communication Access
Real-Time Translation. A CART is a person who,
similar to a court stenographer, transcribes words
into sounds by typing live dialogue. Kolbe's CART
interprets the mood of the room and how her class
is receiving her teaching. The CART also lets
Kolbe know if her voice volume is too loud or too
soft for her students.
Kolbe said that though instructors with hear-

ing impairments have cultivated a close-knit com-
munity on campus, instructions are not laid out
clearly for GSIs who need constant aid in order to
communicate.
After her third year, the University finally
understands that Kolbe needs accommodations
every time she.teaches a class. When she started,
it was different.
"At the beginning of the fall semester, I had no
idea who was going to be my interpreter. I had
no idea if I was even going to have an interpreter
when I showed up for class," Kolbe said.
Kolbe also did not know who would pay for her
CART, which roused anxiety about disclosure of
her disability.
"In my funding package, when I first got my let-
ter of offer from the University, I was really afraid
of being open with my department about the
extent of the accommodations I needed because I
was scared they were just going to give me a grad-
ing position," Kolbe said. "And it's really important
if you want to go into academia, if you want to be
a professor, you have experience teaching classes.
She added that accommodating a GSI with a
disability can be expensive and departments may
be more reluctant to help if they are concerned
about their budget.
The power of the University to refuse accom-
modations is a major concern for GSIs with a dis-
ability.
"Because we are in this weird position of being
students and employees, it leads to a situation
where a lot of us are afraid to be open about what
we need," Kolbe said.
For Kolbe, everything takes much longer with
a disability. The material covered in a one-hour
lecture can easily turn into four hours of lecture.
This not only affects Kolbe as an employee, but
also as a student in the learning environment. It's
also the reason for a push in the GEO contract that
would exempt students with disabilities from the
10-term rule, which currently states graduate stu-

Finding a
compromise
GEO renews its contract
with the University every few
years. According to GEO Presi-
dent Rob Gillezeau, the last con-
tract was negotiatedthreeyears
ago, and the bargaining mostly
regarded wages. Now, graduate
students and research assis-
tants are tackling bigger issues,
like parental rights and disabil-
ity accommodations.
The contract details GSI
rights and what they need as
an employee of the University.
Every Wednesday, the GEO
meets with University officials
and a lawyer to make compro-
mises for the needs of GSIs and
issues concerning their identi-
ties. In the meetings, parent-
ing issues, health care, flexible
time schedules, salary, among
other things, are discussed and
handled.
Marie Puccio, GEO solidarity
and political action committee
chair, said all professors should
make aneffort togivetheirGSIs
work that aligns with the arti-
cles of their contract.
"That's the behavior I expect
and appreciate from profes-
sors because as both graduate
employees and graduate stu-
dents, there are a lot of demands on our time, and it is
important to make sure ourwork is kept to what our
contract stipulates," Puccio said.
So far, Puccio believes discussions about disabili-
ties have been received positively, but once money
becomes a factor, negotiationsbecome more difficult.
The newly-proposed contract consists of changes
to the GSI rights and procedures that would grant
those with disabilities more respect, more rights and
an avenue to an efficient procedure to obtain aid.
The contract would detail instructions on how to
grant aid for disabled GSIs. Puccio said the process for
accommodating GSIs with disabilities is ad hoc and
not transparent.
"We believe that the University also believes that
we should work together to improve the accommoda-
tions process and to make sure graduate employees
have everything they need to do their job," Puccio
said.
University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said negoti-
ations with GEO regarding the proposals for disabil-
ity issues are "inappropriate" to talk about at this time
because officials are stillbargaining.
Fitzgerald said the bargaining team is study-
ing carefully what the new proposal entails and he
doesn't know how the University is receiving the
GEO's proposals for changes to articles regarding
disabilities. Fitzgerald said that by March 1, when the
contract is renewed, the amendments the University
has made to the changes suggested in the contract
would be disclosed.
"Certainly from a university's perspective, we
understand that is an important issue to GEO, and we
are at that point now where the negotiating team is
working carefully to study that proposal and under-
stand it," Fitzgerald said.
Romesh Saigal, an industrial engineering profes-

sor who is on the University's negotiating team, said
that commenting on the contract at this time would
be insensitive.
"We have been talking across the table, so me talk-
ing offof the hat would be averyunfair thingtoboth
parties," Saigal added.
The other five members of the University bargain-
ing team who meet with GEO weekly did not return
calls for comment.
Stuart Segal, director of Services for Students with
Disabilities, said SSD can help graduate students with
disabilities, but GSIs need to contact officials from
the Office of Institutional Equity or their individual
departments if they need assistance.
According to Segal, the University needs to lay out
a more visible and comprehensive way for employees
to obtain accommodations for their individual dis-
abilities.
"I think there is a process in place, and I think there
are ways that process can become more efficient and
more well-known,"hesaid. "Ithinkthatdepartments
and schools aren't aware of the process."
New hope
A newly-drafted disability article was recently
introduced in the bargaining committee and will
be placed in the revised GEO contract that expires
in the beginning of March. It proposes specific
changes to the way graduate student employees
with disabilities are treated in an educational envi-
