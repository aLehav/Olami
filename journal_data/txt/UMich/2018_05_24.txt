Students to launch new straw
bale house on Campus Farm 

T
eam will unveil 
sustainable design 
next week 

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

A University of Michigan green 
building class plans to unveil a 
sustainably-built, straw-bale house 
located at the Campus Farm next 
Monday, May 29. Led by Joseph 
Trumpey, an assistant professor of 
art in the School of Art & Design 
and natural resources in the School 
for Environment and Sustainability, 
the team of about 20 students began 
construction on May 2 and has since 
spent six days a week at the build 
site, many of the students living in 
nearby tents. The straw-bale house 
will be the first official student-
constructed building in Ann Arbor.
Last spring, Trumpey’s green 
building class built a straw-bale 
structure at the U-M biostation in 
Pellston, Mich. Though the two 
buildings are similar in design, the 

first is smaller, with a 20-by-20-feet 
interior and a different roof design. 
Some 
students, 
like 
Taubman 
junior Wendy Zhuo, worked on the 
project in Pellston and enrolled in 
Trumpey’s course again this year. 
Zhuo said she enjoyed being able 
to help with funding and grants 
this time, rather than doing purely 
hands-on work as she did last spring.
“It’s nice being on the back side of 
stuff and seeing more of the project 
instead of just starting the build,” 
Zhuo said.
The project is supported by about 
20 donors. Most of the money for the 
straw-bale house initiative comes 
from University-affiliated sponsors, 
including the Planet Blue Student 
Innovation Fund and the Third 
Century Initiative. The remaining 
funds and materials come from 
other donors, like Turner Electric.
Trumpey 
hopes 
the 
new 
building will serve as a community 
gathering spot and a focal point for 
the Campus Farm, which has few 
other buildings on site. In the future, 
classes and meetings will take 
place in the straw-bale building, as 

will sustainability-focused events 
hosted by Michigan Dining, one of 
Trumpey’s partners.
According 
to 
Trumpey, 
the initiative is an exercise in 
sustainable agriculture. Trumpey 
values green living; in fact, both 
the Pellston and Ann Arbor straw-
bale structures are smaller-scale 
versions of his own home: a solar-
powered straw bale building that 
has housed Trumpey and his family 
for almost 10 years.
Like Trumpey’s home, the straw-
bale house will be completely off the 
grid, relying fully on solar power 
generated by a 1.5-kilowatt array 
of roof panels attached to eight 
golf-cart 
batteries. 
Additionally, 
the house is built of sustainable 
materials, mostly straw and mud.
“Being able to use a lot of local, 
low-energy natural materials is 
really the heart of this,” Trumpey 
said, 
adding 
that 
he 
even 
collaborated with Campus Forestry 
to harvest wood for the structure’s 
scaffolding.

Classes to 
start before 
Labor Day
2020’s academic year 
to start on August 31

By RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Summer Daily News Editor

The 
University’s 
academic 
calendar year will begin before 
Labor Day in 2020, according to a 
statement released by Spokeswoman 
Kim Broekhuizen.
This 
is 
the 
first 
time 
the 
University’s schedule will begin 
before Labor Day according to the 
available academic calendars on the 
Office of the Registrar’s website 
that go back to 2003.
According to the statement, the 
fall term will begin Aug. 31 and end 
Dec. 21. Winter term will begin Jan. 
6 with commencement May 2.
With the new start date, there 
will be a one-week break between 
the end of summer semester and 
the beginning of the fall semester, 
according 
to 
Broekhuizen’s 
statement. There will be two weeks 
between the fall and winter semester, 
with Spring Break running from Feb. 
27 until March 7 and no classes the 
day before Thanksgiving. Fall Break 
dates will remain the same.
Regent Andrea Fischer Newman 
(R) said in an email interview the 
University changed the schedule so 
final exams would end earlier.
“The way the calendar worked 
that year finals would not have ended 
until Christmas Eve,” Newman said. 
“So rather than make students stay 
in Ann Arbor until Christmas Eve, 
the University pushed back the start 
date of the school year.”
Newman also explained costs 
regarding the new start date will not 
change.
The 
University 
has 
not 
yet 
determined the dates for the 2021-
2022 academic school year.

LEO calls for a close
in campus wage gap

Dearborn and Flint 
push for higher wages

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

Steven Toth, a chemistry lecturer 
at the University of Michigan-Flint, 
loves to teach. According to Toth, 
his teaching experience at U-M Flint 
has been incredible, and he enjoys 
working with students and faculty 
there.
But Toth is considering leaving 
his job. He holds a doctorate in his 
field and teaches more students 
in the department than any other 
instructor, 
including 
tenured 
professors, but earns $28,000 a year.
“I’ve been working at U-M Flint 
now for many years, and just at this 
incredibly low salary, I haven’t been 
able to pull myself up at all,” Toth 
said. “I’ve been barely able to pay 
off my debts. I haven’t been able to 
afford a house. I can’t afford a nicer 
car. I can’t go on any vacations. We’ve 
been putting off starting a family for 
years because we can’t afford to have 
children.”

Toth 
is 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Lecturers’ Employee Organization, 
which represents about 1,700 non-
tenured faculty members across 
the three U-M campuses. Contract 
negotiations between LEO and 
University administrators are still 
underway; the two parties convened 
Friday at a regents’ meeting in 
Dearborn, focusing on gaps in 
lecturer salaries between Ann Arbor, 
Flint and Dearborn.
Lecturers in Ann Arbor are 
paid significantly more than those 
in Flint and Dearborn, and the 
administration’s newest proposal 
would maintain that disparity by 
raising the minimum salary after 
three years to $45,000 in Ann 
Arbor, $37,000 in Dearborn and 
$36,000 in Flint. Annual increases 
and equity adjustments would also 
be higher in Ann Arbor. Though 
LEO organizers are not yet satisfied 
with the proposed raises for Ann 
Arbor lecturers, they are particularly 
unhappy with the University’s offers 
for the other two campuses.

City Council 
continues to 
discuss “Y lot”

By ROB DALKA

For The Daily

 

The Ann Arbor City Council 
voted 9-2 in favor of the new 2019 
fiscal budget Monday evening. The 
decision came after debate of the 
various new amendments including 
Amendment 1, which proposed to set 
aside funds to finance and effectuate 
settlement of the litigation related to 
the former “Y lot” at 350 S. Fifth Ave.
In another installment of the “Y 
lot” saga, the council voted to set 
aside almost $1.3 million from the 
general fund to cover settlement, 
bond insurance and closing costs 
in addition to taxes. The settlement 
comes between the city of Ann 
Arbor and local real estate developer 
Dennis Dahlmann.
Dahlmann sued the city in an 
effort to keep the lot after the city 
had decided to repurchase the 
property for $4.2 million. The lot was 
originally sold in 2014 to Dahlmann 
under a contract that stipulated he 
would redevelop the site within 
four years and build a new mixed-
use building with part dedicated to 
affordable housing. Dahlmann failed 
to do so, thus prompting the city to 
repurchase the lot. Dahlmann claims 
the city made it impossible for him 

to build and filed a lawsuit for legal 
ownership of the lot.
Councilmember 
Chip 
Smith, 
D-Ward 5, who introduced the 
amendment in the meeting, said the 
council was undergoing this action of 
settlement to eliminate any risk of the 
lot being lost in litigation and ensure 
it is used to build affordable housing.
“My concern is that we could end 
up in a worst-case scenario, in which 
the property could be flipped to any 
developer who then could build a 
market-rate development, with the 
limits allowed by zoning,” Smith said. 
“Under that scenario, everyone in the 
community, I believe, loses.”
Councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm, 
I-Ward 2, was opposed to the 
amendment as she saw it as an 
inappropriate use of a budget 
amendment.
During the middle of a fiscal year, 
a decision to allocate funds to pay a 
settlement that was not otherwise 
budgeted – like the proposed 
allocation – would take eight votes. 
However, during a budget meeting it 
only needs six votes to be included in 
the next fiscal year’s budget. Lumm 
had strong words against this motion.
“(The 
amendment) 
uses 
the 
budget as a tool in a little game rather 
than what it should be: a document to 
reflect the priorities of our residents,” 
Lumm said.

“Training for surgery”

Michigan Medicine 
works with patients to 
prepare for surgery

By SAYALI AMIN

Daily Staff Reporter 

For the past five years, the 

Michigan Surgical and Health 

Optimization Program at Mich-

igan Medicine has been work-

ing with patients undergoing 

large operations, such as can-

cer surgeries or transplants, to 

help them better prepare for 

their procedures during the 

waiting period. MSHOP has 

led to reduced costs of care and 

improvements in recovery.

Dr. 
Michael 
Englesbe, 
a 

transplant 
surgeon 
running 

MSHOP, said there could be up 

to a two-month gap between 

when a patient schedules a sur-

gery and when they undergo the 

procedure.

“It can be a really scary time 

for patients, they’re just waiting 

for the big operation,” Engles-

be said. “So during that time, 

instead of waiting and worrying 

we’ve started training patients.”

Englesbe uses the analogy 

of a 5K race, pointing out most 

people train for a race. Trans-

lating that into surgery, patients 

work toward meeting health 

and wellness goals in time for 

their surgery to optimize their 

recovery. These goals include 

focusing on nutrition, walking, 

exercising, stopping smoking 

and other wellness activities.

The feedback for the pro-

gram has been overall posi-

tive, Englesbe said. The patient 

compliance for the study is 80 

percent, which is much higher 

than most other lifestyle-inter-

vention and wellness studies or 

programs.

“Patients 
appreciate 
the 

opportunity to be empowered 

and actively engaged in their 

care,” Englesbe said. “It helps 

them reduce stress and gives 

them something to focus on.”

Dr. Stewart Wang, a profes-

sor of surgery at the Medical 

School, helped create some of 

the technology for the program. 

In an email interview, Wang 

wrote the program has been 

made to be more customizable 

for the patient.

“We have markedly improved 

our technology based moni-

toring of patient progress so 

that we can intervene (or just 

provide 
encouragement) 
as 

needed to optimize progress,” 

Wang wrote. “We make patient 

progress over the course of the 

program easier for the patient 

themselves to monitor and also 

allow them to recruit friends 

and family to help them achieve 

their goals.”

Wang wrote he has been 

working with patient-better-

ment technologies and software 

algorithms in conjunction with 

the U-M Department of Surgery 

to make MSHOP a more stream-

lined program.

“My group is also adapting 

the original MSHOP technology 

I developed so that it can work 

in settings other than an aca-

demic medical center, which is 

where the vast majority of clini-

cal care in the US takes place,” 

Wang wrote. “We are translat-

ing the program out into the 

real-world healthcare market-

place.”

According 
to 
a 
previous 

Michigan Medicine newsletter, 

“Program facilitators worked to 

craft notes with positive, natu-

ral-sounding language to make 

the exchanges personal and 

more effective.”

Currently, MSHOP is pri-

marily available at Michigan 

Medicine and certain practices 

across the state of Michigan. 

Applying the program on a 

larger scale is a slow process, 

Englesbe said.

“The program takes time for 

nurses and doctors, and most 

nurses and doctors are already 

working full time,” Englesbe 

said. “Any additional kind of 

work is difficult to implement; 

you need to pay them.”

Englesbe said they’ve begun 

working with Blue Cross and 

Blue Shield to discuss a way 

to compensate those spending 

time training patients.

A MSHOP study of the pro-

gram wrapped up a few months 

ago and Englesbe hopes the new 

data will help prove the benefits 

and even accelerate the adop-

tion of the program.

“I think it’ll become stan-

dard of care slowly, but it’s just 

going to take a long, long time,” 

Englesbe 
said. 
“Hopefully 

patients will start to expect it, 

to demand it.”

University approves $19M dance building

By ELIZABETH
LAWRENCE

Daily Staff Reporter 

Last Thursday, the University 
of Michigan Board of Regents 
approved plans for a new $19 
million dance building for the 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance to be built on North Cam-
pus. The building will have state-
of-the-art facilities, including 
a 100-seat performance space, 
larger studios, smart classrooms, 
faculty offices and more. It will 
further expand upon the Earl V. 
Moore Building, which is home 
to the music department of the 
Music, Theatre & Dance School.
Presently, the dance build-
ing is connected to the Central 
Campus Recreational Building, 
while the other departments 
of the Music, Theatre & Dance 
School are located on North. The 
current dance building, which 
opened in 1977, fit the needs of 
the department at the time but 
was outgrown, according to Jes-
sica Fogel, professor and chair 
of dance. Fogel said the plan for 
a new dance building has been 
brewing for some time.
“This current project rests 
on the shoulders of many dance 
faculty teams over many long 
years,” Fogel said. “We’ve been 
envisioning a new dance build-
ing for decades actually.”
University 
Regent 
Andrea 
Fischer Newman (R) explained 
it was finally approved because 
funding 
had 
been 
secured 
through philanthropy, invest-
ment proceeds and other sourc-
es. She expressed her excitement 
to support the dance program in 
this way.
“This is an opportunity to 
really move the last piece of the 
School of Music, Theatre and 
Dance to North Campus, and 
do it in a way that it deserves,” 
Newman said.
Fogel said she was looking 
forward to the new building’s 
upgraded spaces, such as a studio 
with media allowing for projects 
tying dance with technology. 
With these improvements, as 

well as having more space in 
general, Fogel said the dance 
program will be able to meet the 
needs of more students.
“There will be a much better 
integration of technology; this 
integration has become stan-
dard in teaching dance,” Fogel 
said. “We will be better able to 
accommodate our very popu-
lar dance courses. We’ll also be 
able to accommodate more com-
munity groups and conferences 
because the new building will 
have more ample facilities.”
Further, Fogel noted the relo-
cation to North Campus will 
allow for more collaboration 
between dance, the other Music, 
Theatre & Dance branches and 
the Schools of Engineering, 

Architecture and Art & Design.
“The new building promises 
to be an exciting collaborative 
hub,” Fogel said. “We’ll have 
proximity to our peers in the 
SMTD and to facilities in the 
Duderstadt as well as to the 
School of Art & Design, Archi-
tecture, 
Engineering. 
We’ve 
done amazing projects with 
these units over the years, but 
it will be much easier and more 
organic to collaborate with them 
on North Campus.”
Music, Theatre & Dance soph-

omore Victoria Briones echoed 
this sentiment. She said the cur-
rent dance building location is 
less than ideal and expressed 
her eagerness to move to North 
Campus in order to easily work 
with the other programs.
“I’m excited to be close to 
the rest of SMTD because we’re 
the only school in SMTD is on 
Central Campus,” Briones said. 
“Even though (we) work with 
other departments a lot, we col-
laborate a lot with music stu-
dents especially, there’s always 
been that kind of separation. 
So we’re excited to be on North 
Campus with them.”
The plans for the building are 
only just beginning, but already 
Briones and other dance stu-
dents were able to give sugges-
tions for the design at a forum 
with the architectural team. 
Briones said she expressed her 
desire for the building design to 
embrace accessibility and inclu-
sion, making all who enter feel 
welcome.
“One thing that came up in the 
forum that’s really important to 
me and I hope comes to fruition 
with this building is we’re trying 
to make it more accessible,” Brio-
nes said. “We’re going to make it 
more handicap-accessible, and 
we’re also pushing for gender-
inclusive bathrooms. We’re try-
ing to make it a more welcoming 
space.”
Newman noted the dance pro-
gram has often been left behind 
in terms of improving facilities 
and resources within the Music, 
Theatre & Dance School. Now 
that all three divisions of the 
school will be on North Campus, 
Newman said, the arts program 
will be even stronger — some-
thing she believes is deeply 
important.
“I’m a huge advocate for the 
arts,” Newman said. “Person-
ally, my husband and I have 
supported SMTD and believe 
in order to be a great Uni-
versity, you have to be great 
in the arts, and we basically 
have 
a 
conservatory-style 
school at a big university, 
which is very, very unusual. 
I think the arts bring some-
thing to campus that every 
student benefits from.”

OPINION

Ann Arbor, MI 48109

Edited and managed by students at 
the University of Michigan since 1890.

I

’m several weeks into my first 
spring semester at University of 
Michigan, and I still can’t believe 
it’s actually happening. My mind 
can’t juxtapose the warm weather 
and greenery with the formerly bitter 
atmosphere surrounding the Diag. 
Every time I exhibit winter-like 
behavior, like subconsciously reaching 
for a sweater or waking up with 
anxieties about final assignments, it 
becomes increasingly clear that the 
aftermath of semesters past has me 
shell-shocked. After enduring what 
seemed like the longest semester of 
everyone’s life this past winter, I find 
my mind significantly lagging. It’s as 
if I’m waiting to catch up — as if time 
is moving forward without me while I 
passively go through the motions. And 
no matter how far back in history last 
semester becomes, I still can’t rid my 
mind of its debris.
I had certain expectations going into 
this semester. As a transfer student, I 
was excited to relish in my first and only 
remaining opportunity to experience 
spring in Ann Arbor. I was told that 
campus is quieter, more peaceful. 
And aside from campus, I looked 
forward to exploring the greater Ann 
Arbor community, which promises an 
eventful season for those who choose 
stick around. For me personally, the 
beautiful natural elements of this 
city hold an important responsibility. 
Spring is when everything comes to 
life, at the same time I’m supposed to 
be resurrecting my own spirit. Going 
in, I felt that I earned the trees, that 
I deserve the flowers and that the 
wonders of the Arb are anticipating my 
arrival the same way I did for the sun’s.

Yes, campus is peaceful. And yes, 
Ann Arbor is a sanctuary for the free-
spirited. But in these two weeks, I 
learned quickly that a fresh season 
doesn’t necessarily coincide with a fresh 
and prepared mind. My expectations 
were quickly shot down, and I’m 
beginning to think that the pressures 
of a “fresh start” could be the reason 
spring has been so difficult.
It’s hard to start fresh after weeks 
of adhering to the same routine over 
and over again. While this holds true 
for every semester, the one-week 
pseudo-break between winter and 
spring doesn’t exactly warrant enough 
time for a clean mental transition. 
Realistically, it’s just a week of old habits, 
like feeling your heart sink at 11:59 p.m. 
when assignments are normally due 
and habitually refreshing Canvas for 
no reason. The stress of the school year 
carries over, which may be the reason 
why I’m struggling to come to terms 
with the present. Walking to class 
feels stale, almost robotic. Everything 
feels like an extension of last semester. 
In fact, I’m writing this from the same 
and only spot I was able to get work 
done in the winter. And believe me, it’s 
not that I want to be in this same spot. 
I would much rather be under a tree, 
tackling my vitamin D deficiency. But 
I feel like a caged flower, and while the 
hands of spring have unlocked the cage 
door, I don’t have the means to escape. 
So I remain put. My mind and body 
are victims to the abstraction of time, 
nestled between the routine of weeks 
prior and the anticipation of a distant 
summer. It also doesn’t help that the 
windows in Mason Hall tease me with 
a visual of the latter.

I’m sure other people can relate to 
the way I’m feeling. I don’t know what 
the consensus is on campus, but most 
people I’ve spoken to can agree that 
spring semester is at least a different 
experience than its colder counterparts. 
And I’m not just talking about the 
weather. It’s not that the classes are 
longer, or that the rooms are stuffier. 
It’s not that professors lecture just a 
little bit slower. It’s something about the 
glassy-eyed look on everyone’s face that 
really brings me down. But at the same 
time, I find comfort when I look across 
the classroom and notice a community 
of spring-semester zombies that are 
experiencing the same phenomenon.
Maybe we are living in a simulation 
and spring semester brings out the 
Cartesian skepticism in all of us. Just 
because I think I’m in a classroom 
doesn’t mean it actually exists, right? My 
senses could very well be deceiving me 
into thinking that winter ended. Maybe, 
upon closer reflection, spring semester 
is just winter in disguise. Maybe there’s 
an evil genius deceiving us all, wanting 
us to believe in the trees, sunlight and 
most importantly in the Diag dogs. As I 
continue to reflect on this term, I’d like 
to extend my optimism to anyone else 
in this funk. I’m still hopeful that spring 
will fulfill our expectations eventually. 
We’ll find ways to work effectively — 
whether that involves getting some 
sunlight or soaking in our indoor habits. 
Regardless, we’ll readjust. And we’ll 
have to do it all over again when fall 
comes around.

Sexual abuse in women’s sports
T

he 
culture 
surrounding 
female athletics is 
often 
inappropriate 
and 
usually ignored. We talk 
about 
the 
need 
to 
stop 
objectif ying 
women, 
yet 
the former president of the 
International 
Federation 
of 
Association 
Football 
still 
felt 
he 
could 
say 
women’s soccer might be 
more popular if the players 
wore 
“tighter 
shorts.” 
Not that this quote needs 
any analysis as it is so 
blatantly 
disrespectful, 
but he is saying women’s 
athletics will not be valued 
unless there is some type 
of 
added 
sexualization. 
Nobody 
would 
ever 
tell 
male athletes they might 
be more successful if they 
played every sport shirtless. 
It shows the kind of double 
standard 
and 
inequality 
female athletes constantly 
face.
The 
objectification 
and 
discrediting of women in 
sports 
still 
exists, 
and 
female 
athletes 
continue 
to 
be 
viewed 
as 
sexual 
objects through the male 
gaze. 
As 
English 
writer 
Virginia Woolf so astutely 
pointed out in 1929 – nearly 
100 years ago – “The best 
woman was … the inferior of 
the worst man.” However, to 
counteract this destructive 
mentality, 
many 
athletes 
have started movements to 
gain respect and equality 
such as “Equal Play, Equal 
Pay,” 
the 
U.S. 
women’s 
soccer team’s campaign for 
wages equivalent to male 
counterparts.“With athletes 
slowly acknowledging the 
gender inequality in their 
fields, there may be hope 
for change. But that’s just 
the beginning. 
The 
objectification 
of 
women athletes perpetuates 
both inequality and has led 
to an incredible number of 
sexual assault cases. As an 
institutional problem that is 
underreported and ignored, 
many female athletes are 
uneducated 
on 
what 
to 
do when these situations 
arise. Most female athletes 
are coached by men, most 
athletic trainers are men, 
most 
team 
owners 
are 

men; not surprisingly, the 
only 
female-dominated 
part of women’s teams are 
the 
players 
themselves. 
This 
discrepancy 
has 
normalized 
a 
culture 
of 
sexual 
harassment: 
“The 
athletes complained about a 
thriving sexist environment 
where verbal abuse went 
unchecked, 
sexual 
jokes 
and sexual allusion to what 
athletes must do to make 
the team were commonplace 
and 
there 
was 
a 
high 
tolerance for homophobic 
and sexist attitudes among 

the coaches.”

A 
recent 
example 
of 
this that shook both the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
community and the entire 
sports world is the Larry 
Nassar scandal at Michigan 
State 
University. 
Many 
administrators 
of 
both 
MSU and USA Gymnastics 
supposedly knew he was 
sexually assaulting female 
g ymnasts. It is clear there 
is 
a 
widespread 
issue 
when the people with the 
authority 
to 
stop 
these 
kinds of actions do nothing. 
The issue lies in the fact 
that 
these 
incidents 
are 
happening, the perpetrators 
aren’t punished and these 
athletes are uncertain about 
what they should or can 
do. If this kind of behavior 
is going to be normalized 
by sports, the least that 
could be done is to educate 
women on their resources 
and options for reporting it.

female 
dominated part

I

t’s 7:45 a.m. We’re walking 
down East Liberty Street. 
I 
have 
two 
rakes 
in 
my hand, and Shannon, my 
roommate, has a drawstring 
bag on her back that holds a 
spade, a fork, a hoe and a pair 
of shears. We’re excited, if 
not a little bit sheepish, about 
the adventure that lies ahead 
of us. I learned early on in 
my time at the University of 
Michigan that “wasting time,” 
which is broadly defined as 
“doing something that you 
aren’t going to put on your 
resume,” is a criminal offense, 
and, up until now, I’ve been 
utterly opposed to breaking 
the law. But not today. Today I 
don’t care if I’m wasting time. 
Today I’m going to play in the 
yard.
We arrive at a pretty little 
house with lots of weeds in the 
yard and set our tools down 
on the front porch. Shannon 
takes one side of the sidewalk 
and I take the other. We dig 
out weeds with our hands and 
talk about the adventures we 
want to go on this summer. I 
pull my hair into a ponytail so 
I can feel the sun on the back 
of my neck. I’m having fun. 
Is that what it’s called? Fun? 
I haven’t had this much dirt 
underneath 
my 
fingernails 
since I was 8 years old digging 
for treasure in my backyard. 
Of course, I’m 20 years old, 
and therefore way too old to 
play in the yard. I’m in college, 
meaning I should be spending 
every spare moment making 
myself 
more 
“employable,” 
whatever that means. In two 
years, I will have graduated 
and 
officially 
entered 
the 
job market, and no employer 
wants to hire a girl who uses 
her valuable free time to play 
in the dirt.
About 
41 
percent 
of 
Americans let some of their 
paid 
vacation 
days 
go 
to 
waste, 
likely 
because 
they 
don’t want to be perceived as 
lazy for taking advantage of 
the benefits outlined in their 
contract. In fact, this survey of 
U.S. corporate managers finds 
that 
many 
equate 
working 
longer hours with being more 
dedicated, more hardworking 
and more responsible. Michael 
Bloomberg’s 
career 
advice? 
Don’t even go to the bathroom, 

let alone take time off to take 
a vacation or play in the dirt. 
In 2011, he said, “I am not 
smarter than anybody else 
but I can outwork you – and 
my key to success for you, or 
anybody else, is making sure 
you are the first one in there 
every day and the last one to 
leave. Don’t ever take a lunch 
break or go to the bathroom, 
you keep working.”

I’m a sucker for this kind 
of 
industriousness. 
That’s 
why I’m at the University of 
Michigan! I take pride in my 
ability to work hard. During 
the school year, I didn’t take 
any 
breaks. 
I 
outworked 
everyone else and I didn’t rest 
or relax at all-- that is, until I 
sat myself down on my couch 
to tell Shannon a funny story. 
But when I opened my mouth, 
instead 
of 
words 
coming 
out, I just started crying. “I 
think we’ve finally done it,” 
Shannon said. “I think we’ve 
finally worked ourselves past 
our breaking points.”
So we decided to go back to 
where we came from the front 
yard, playing in the dirt. The 
same place we spent every 
summer until we hit 12 years 
old and realized that playing 
in the dirt isn’t productive 
and that we should be using 
the spare time to set goals 
and get jobs. Maybe someday 
I’ll really reach adulthood, 
and I’ll be able to work, work, 
work from sunup to sundown, 
and it won’t kill me or run me 
dry. But right now, at 20 years 
old, I’m still better suited for 
playing in the dirt than I am 
for sitting at desk 12 hours a 
day. Figures.
It’s 10 a.m. now, so it’s time 
to put wipe the dirt off our 

knees and walk back down 
East Liberty Street to get 
home. I remember playing in 
the backyard with my sister, 
and 
my 
dad 
would 
come 
outside and ruin all the fun 
by telling us it was time to go 
to bed. Summer was the best 
time of year because when our 
faces fell and we told him we 
weren’t tired yet, he would 
remind us that we didn’t have 
school the next day and we 
could go back outside first 
thing in the morning if we 
wanted to.
Shannon and I wash the 
dirt 
out 
from 
underneath 
our fingernails, and we put 
slacks 
and 
button-downs 
over our sunburnt, mosquito-
bitten bodies. We will go 
about the rest of our days 
without 
committing 
any 
unspoken criminal offenses. 
In two years, when we start 
interviewing 
for 
our 
first 
“big-kid jobs,” we’ll tell the 
employers about how in the 
summer of 2018, we spent 
our 
afternoons 
in 
offices 
completing 
internships. 
We won’t tell them about 
mornings when we played in 
the dirt and let the sun beat 
down on the backs of our 
necks. We won’t tell them 
about how if we hadn’t let 
ourselves play in the dirt that 
summer, even just a little bit, 
we might not have made it 
through summer at all.
When 
you 
spend 
your 
summer in Ann Arbor, it’s 
hard for it to feel like summer, 
because, like it or not, it’s still 
Ann Arbor. It’s still the lovely 
little town that worked you 
until you ran dry all winter, 
the lovely little town where 
you received your first failing 
grades and got rejected from 
your first jobs. When you walk 
down East Liberty Street, it’s 
hard to believe that you’re 
allowed to end up somewhere 
besides the Starbucks where 
you studied every evening 
during the winter semester. 
But if you ever want to join 
Shannon and me when we’re 
playing in the dirt, I highly 
recommend it. We leave at 
7:45 a.m. I promise I won’t tell 
your future employer.

OPINION

Thursday, May 24, 2018
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Many of these issues 
arise from abuse from the 
male coaches; these are 
the most common cases.
I myself can speak to 
this 
issue. 
Just 
before 
I 
left 
for 
college, 
it 
was discovered that my 
32-year-old soccer coach 
was 
having 
a 
sexual 
relationship 
with 
a 
16-year-old teammate of 
mine. Many people went 
straight to victim blaming 
and asked why she would 
even consider doing that. 
It is extremely important 
to remember this is not her 
fault. Most youth coaches 
are very charismatic and 
develop strong, trusting 
relationships with their 
players. 
This 
situation 
was 
no 
different. 
He 
manipulated 
her 
into 
believing he loved her, 
despite 
the 
outside 
factors that he had a wife 
and was twice her age. As 
I mentioned earlier, this 
is sadly all too familiar 
for many young female 
athletes.
Furthermore, 
many 
female 
athletes 
fear 
getting cut from a team or 
losing playing time if they 
displease a coach. These 
stories and the countless 
others 
like 
them 
are 
“testimony to the culture 
that exists in sport which 
pressures female athletes 
to put up with the sexist 
environment 
and 
gives 
the impression that those 
in positions of authority, 
who have sexual motives, 
have little or no difficulty 
in 
selecting 
vulnerable 
athletes upon whom they 
prey.” The objectification 
of female athletes starts 
at a young age and many 
young, 
talented 
women 

face abuse. This kind of 
sexualization and abuse 
has pervaded the women’s 
sports 
industry 
and, 
tragically, a very large 
number of female athletes 
are 
familiar 
with 
the 
very 
real 
consequences 
it causes. Furthermore, 
this 
male-dominated 
industry 
has 
“not 
yet 
developed effective ways 
of 
handling 
complaints 
and communicating these 
processes to the athletes 
… not only was the process 
a difficult one, but the 
athletes were generally 
unsatisfied 
with 
the 
outcomes.”
The 
men 
running 
these organizations have 
failed to create a safe 
environment for female 
athletes to report their 
abuse. 
This 
indirectly 
perpetuates 
the 
issue 
of 
sexual 
assault 
and 
therefore reinforces the 
inequality 
women 
are 
facing in sports today. 
There need to be programs 
put in place that educate 
female athletes on sexual 
assault. 
They 
need 
to 
know what they can do 
if they find themselves 
in one of these situations 
and they need to be sure 
if 
they 
do 
choose 
to 
come forward, they will 
be treated with respect 
and be believed and the 
process 
will 
be 
just. 
Without these kinds of 
programs, objectification, 
sexualization 
and 
abuse will continue to 
be normalized and the 
inequality will persist.

Charly Bliss tour 
ends with gusto

Courtney Barnett asks 
for sincerity in ‘Tell Me’

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

Courtney Barnett’s second 
album begins: “Y’know what 
they say / No one’s born to hate 
/ We learn it somewhere along 
the way.” Paraphrased from 
Nelson Mandela, that line from 
the opener “Hopefulessness” 
sets the tone for the rest of Tell 
Me How You Really Feel, a tri-
umphant return after her debut 
LP, Sometimes I Sit and Think, 
And Sometimes I Just Sit and a 
2017 collaboration with singer-
songwriter Kurt Vile.
Tell Me still carries Barnett’s 
signature 
rambling, 
deadpan 
delivery, but with a darker fla-
vor than her previous releases. 
Through thirty-seven minutes 
Barnett holds court with her 
friends, lovers and enemies 
with strength and piercing wit, 
touching on issues like femi-
nism and isolation with a noisy 
rock edge. At its base, the Aussie 
songwriter’s sophomore effort 
is a record about truth in all its 
forms, be it hard to swallow or 
written on the wall.
Beyond these subtle changes 
from her past work, it’s all but 
obvious that Tell Me is a cathar-
tic release for Barnett. Those 
already fans of the artist are 
probably more familiar with a 
laid-back, 
sardonic 
approach 
present in earlier songs like 
“Avant Gardener,” in which she 

narrates her own asthma attack, 
and “History Eraser,” about the 
confusing beginnings of love. 
This record is notably more 
pissed-off than Barnett’s first, 
both attached and apathetic to 
her experiences and relation-
ships as a woman in the world.
She navigates feedback-laced 
webs of sound to push through 
a 
message 
of 
individualism 
and transparency, most notice-
able on anthems “I’m Not Your 
Mother, I’m Not Your Bitch,” 

taking 
on 
the 
virgin-whore 
complex one guitar stroke at a 
time. Nonetheless, the song-
writer manages to maintain her 
classic dark humor throughout 
the album, even making a song 
titled “Crippling Self Doubt and 
a General Lack of Self Control” 
witty with lines like “And inde-
cision rots / like a bag of last 
week’s meat.” Barnett might not 
be funny on this record, but she 
sure is honest. And what is more 
hilarious than the realities of 
life?
The artist focuses in on this 
honesty throughout the album’s 

first single “Nameless, Face-
less,” the title a nod to Nirvana’s 
“Endless, Nameless” and an 
angered response to the unjust 
realities of being a woman. 
She references iconic feminist 
author Margaret Atwood in the 
chorus with the sharp-tongued 
line “Men are afraid that women 
will laugh at them / Women are 
afraid that men will kill them” 
with a sharp tongue. The song is 
big, headstrong and truly rocks 
hard — it’s a women’s anthem 
without any frills, and certainly 
no beating around the bush.
Though much of Tell Me How 
You Really Feel is hard-edged, 
songs like the album’s crown 
jewel 
“City 
Looks 
Pretty,” 
“Charity” and others are almost 
happy-sounding. They attack 
tough issues of isolation, impos-
ter syndrome and unhappiness, 
but Barnett’s signature story-
telling and musical prowess 
manages to flip them into dance-
able rock bangers. It forces an 
audience to recognize the songs’ 
lyrics as they enjoy the music, 
which is valuable in itself; Bar-
nett isn’t hiding anything from 
her listeners, proving that joy 
and anger can coexist, and even 
create some really fantastic 
music. At the end of the day, all 
the singer wants to do is “Walk 
through the park in the dark.” 
In this record, Barnett poses 
a question we should all think 
about: Why can’t she?

CLARA SCOTT

On May 18, Charly Bliss brought 
their brand of snarky, sugar-rush 
indie rock to Ferndale’s The Loving 
Touch. In the beginning, the crowd 
was stirring a bit, due to opener Skat-
ing Polly having a medical emergen-
cy and unable to perform, but once 
Eva Hendricks and company hit the 
stage, they had everyone’s attention.
What makes Charly Bliss so mag-
netic is, hands down, their front-
woman. Hendricks commands the 
stage with a bewitching, off-kilter 
poise. She’s conscious of it, too. She 
keeps her bleached hair in a long 
bang across her forehead, a la 2007 
MySpace Emo, that started to stick 
with sweat to her forehead as the 
show progressed. More than her 
appearance, however, is her abil-
ity as a performer. Hendricks has 
the high, honeyed voice of a toddler 
that is praising a puppy. The contrast 
between her voice’s qualities and lyr-
ics like “I can’t cum and I can’t lie / I 
can’t stop making myself cry” is one 
of the essential strengths of Charly 
Bliss.
That isn’t to say, however, that she 
overshadows her bandmates. Bass-
ist Dan Shure and drummer Sam 
Hendricks provide backing vocals 
on most songs, and guitarist Spencer 
Fox absolutely shreds on tracks like 
“Love Me” and “Black Hole.” There’s 
an understanding that, yes, Eva is 
the most charismatic, but Fox brings 
the technical prowess and Shure and 
Sam keep the group on track.
Their set opened with smaller 
hits, like “Westermarck,” “Ruby” 
and “Glitter,” from their debut album 
Guppy, and it was a pleasure to watch 

Charly Bliss wind themselves up for 
the songs everyone was waiting for: 
“Black Hole” and “Percolator.” As 
mentioned, Hendricks is an intense 
performer, and to watch her sneer as 
she sings “I am pregnant with mean-
ing / Could it be more appealing?” 
(spoiler: it couldn’t) or her eyes widen 
as she pleads “I’m a mess, I mean in 
the best case / Does he love me most? 
Maybe I don’t come close,” (again, 
spoiler: he doesn’t) is captivating.
As Charly Bliss led up to their 
most anthemic songs, they played 
some new material. Their trademark 
sonic elements were there, but the 
songwriting was a little different. 
Instead of collections of images or 
witty phrases, Hendricks rooted her 
romantic hang-ups in real moments, 
and dove into sincere expressions of 
frustration and sadness. It was pow-
erful, and makes me excited for Char-
ly Bliss’s future releases. 
They ended the show with an 
encore of one of my personal favor-
ites, “Love Me.” It’s a quintessential 
soured love song, and coincidentally, 
the first song off their first release, 
Soft Serve EP. Hendricks sings of a 
lover who frankly sucks, but she can-
not help but blame her own short-
comings for the distance between 
them. The entire song is a capitu-
lation of how intimacy reveals the 
unpleasant elements of your partner 
and — guess what — some unpleas-
ant elements of you, too. And by now, 
Hendricks expects it: “Up above me, 
say you love me / Just a little less / I 
know what happens next.” “Love 
Me,” and numerous other songs in 
Bliss’s catalog, are some of the most 
eloquent expressions of heartbreak 
in music right now. It’ll be exciting to 
see where they go next.

Few 
recent 
shows 
have 
caused as much controversy and 
sparked as many discussions 
as Netflix’s adaption of Jay 
Asher’s 2007 novel “13 Reasons 
Why.” It tackles a variety of 
topics 
from 
depression 
and 
sexual assault to bullying, while 
drawing 
criticism 
for 
what 
some believe to be its graphic 
depiction of traumatic events 
and glamorization of topics like 
suicide and self-harm.
The 
show’s 
first 
season 
explored 
the 
circumstances 
surrounding 
the 
suicide 
of 
Liberty High School student 
Hannah 
Baker 
(Katherine 
Langford, 
“Love, 
Simon”) 
through a series of thirteen 
audio 
tapes 
narrated 
by 
Hannah herself. The tapes, 
each addressed to an individual 
who contributed to Hannah’s 
suicide, revealed a harrowing 
series of events caused by both 
individual and systemic failures 
in her high school. 
Season two begins months 
after Hannah’s death, at the 
beginning of a civil lawsuit 
between Hannah’s parents and 
her high school, the latter of 
which is being sued for failure 
to protect Hannah and enabling 
the damaging culture that led 
to her suicide. Each episode 
centers on the testimony of 
an individual mentioned in 

one of Hannah’s tapes, while 
also 
exploring 
the 
effects 
of Hannah’s suicide on the 
students of Liberty High.
The show’s first season dealt 
with difficult topics with a 
sensitivity and maturity that few 
shows centering around such 
a demographic do. Moreover, 
the characters, from Hannah 
herself to her close friend Clay 
Jensen (Dylan Minnette, “Don’t 
Breathe”), felt like realistic, 
multi-dimensional 
teenagers. 
Season two deals with similar 

issues but is let down by 
its own writing and overall 
execution. The dialogue, one 
of the strongest aspects of the 
first season, is now stilted and 
overly melodramatic, especially 
during the courtroom scenes. 
Without the structure provided 
by the series of tapes in season 
one, the early episodes of season 
two lack a sense of cohesion and 
unity. Hannah’s appearances in 
Clay’s hallucinations feel more 
like cheap plot devices. The 
antagonists of the story feel 
almost cartoonishly evil, which 
belies the actual heinousness of 
their crimes.

Season 
two’s 
redeeming 
qualities 
mainly 
concern 
the 
development 
of 
certain 
characters. In particular, Tyler 
(Devin Druid, TV’s “House of 
Cards”), one of the students 
implicated in Hannah’s tapes, is 
slowly fleshed out, albeit in an 
unsettling fashion that seems 
to be a large focus of the season 
as a whole. Minette’s portrayal 
of Clay’s trauma and inability 
to rid himself of memories 
related to Hannah is excellent, 
especially in a set of awkward 
scenes 
with 
his 
girlfriend 
Skye (Sosie Bacon, “Story of a 
Girl”). Zach (Ross Butler, TV’s 
“Riverdale”) and high school 
counselor Kevin Porter (Derek 
Luke, 
TV’s 
“Roots”) 
begin 
compelling 
redemption 
arcs 
as well. Scenes with Hannah’s 
mother Olivia (Kate Walsh, 
“Girls Trip”) are also high notes, 
as she emotionally recounts the 
little moments that she believes 
helped drive her daughter to her 
tragic end.
Season two of “13 Reasons 
Why” takes an even darker, 
more sinister tone than season 
one. Unfortunately, its shoddy 
writing and poor dramatization 
make 
it 
feel 
more 
like 
a 
stereotypical high school drama 
or an ineffective PSA. Season 
one, despite some issues with 
its pacing, tells its story in a 
unique, thoughtful way, which 
season two does not replicate 
with consistency.

white, horny and 
unemployed 
in 
L.A. He’s not just 
“working 
on 
a 
script” unemployed, 
he’s 
directionless 
without 
seeming 
to want direction. Or rather, he 
thinks direction will come find him, 
preferably in the form of secret codes 
planted by other modern geniuses in 
popular culture.
When his mysterious neighbor 
Sarah (Riley Keough, “American 
Honey”) disappears as quickly and 
seamlessly as she appears, Sam is 
finally called to action. The universe 
demands he quit his day job of 
spying on his aging, topless neighbor 
and uncover what the hell is going 
on under the Silver Lake.
Sam follows the bread crumbs 
that align so perfectly (the film 
more than earns this narrative 
ease) it’s a wonder he didn’t plant 
them himself. He takes us through a 
version of L.A. that bears a striking 
resemblance to “La La Land.” Not 
in its choice landmarks per se, but in 
the way it constructs the city around 
cinematic homage. Extremely meta. 

But while “La La Land” earns charm 
from its referential existence, “Silver 
Lake” gets an added layer of unease. 
What came first: Los Angeles or the 
on-screen version of it?
Mitchell has more than just 
Hollywood in his sights though, as 
Sam’s journey drags the audience 
deeper and deeper into the maze 
(sometimes literally) of the film’s 
plot. It becomes obvious Sam 
believes the world was created 
just for him. Beyond the codes and 
keys and messages in songs, Sam 
believes he deserves everything just 
because he exists. His undeserved 
want manifests itself 
brilliantly in the way 
he views women. 
From the moment 
we meet him, behind 
a pair of binoculars 
on his porch, Sam 
is the leering male 
gaze incarnated. He 
wants women so they should want 
him. He wants sex so he deserves it. 
The infatuation that sets the plot in 
motion is born, more than anything, 
out of an unresolved sexual fantasy.
Andrew Garfield’s specifically 
twitchy brand of skinny-guy acting 
has never been better. He is equal 
parts compelling and unsettling as 
Sam. It is as satisfying to see him 
succeed, as it is to see him fail.
“Under the Silver Lake” plants 
a thousand seeds and reaps every 
single one. Although inane, the trail 
Sam follows is airtight. Every twist 
and turn pays off. As he did with 
his other two features, Mitchell 
reimagines what is possible for 
a genre and pushes his film well 
beyond the limits of the expected. 
“Under the Silver Lake” is brilliantly 
acted, a perfect neo-noir and a biting 
social commentary. And it’s fun — 
it’s so much fun.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Thursday, May 24, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

In the Daily newsroom exists 
a leaning stack of prerelease 
books, relegated next to a fil-
ing cabinet. Too often I would 
give the pile no more than one 
passing glance. But in a flitting 
once-over, I recognized a certain 
name along one spine: Questlove.
“Questlove wrote a book?” I 
wondered aloud. “Sign me up.”
Little did I know that this was 
actually book number four in 
Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson’s 
tenure as an author, following 
a memoir, an ode to Soul Train 
and a book about chefs. His lat-
est release, “Creative Quest,” 
follows an entirely different tra-
jectory. The book offers read-
ers insight into Thompson’s 
personal creative process — as 
frontman of The Roots, as a DJ, 
as a producer, as a writer — and 
those of other acclaimed innova-
tors (J. Dilla, Björk 
and Ava DuVer-
nay appear fre-
quently). It is up to 
the reader to turn 
these insights into 
what they desire. 
Is this a book of 
lessons? A list of 
resources for cre-
ative minds? Or is 
it simply a form of 
entertainment for someone who 
likes to read? Thompson doesn’t 
tell us, but he doesn’t have to. 
Deep down, we know.
“Creative Quest” is divided 
into nine sections (should we 
call them chapters? Thompson 
doesn’t, so I won’t). They are 
ordered chronologically, the way 
the steps in a how-to book would 
be, and each depicts a unique 
tenet of the creative process.
Part one, The Spark, ponders 
what makes a person or idea cre-
ative. “The issue isn’t whether 
people can tell that you’re cre-
ative,” Thompson writes. “If 
that’s what you’re worried about, 
wear a beret. The issue is wheth-
er you can connect to your own 
creative impulses.” 
The majority of the book, the 
meat of the sandwich, delves into 
the nitty gritty of creative living. 

Thompson talks about the roles 
mentors may or may not play. He 
writes of creative stagnation and 
its web of potential outcomes. 
He explores possible definitions 
of the creative network, the pros 
and cons of imitation and cura-
tion and the yin-yang relation-
ship of success and failure. He 
gets more abstract than that, 
while still allowing for varied 
interpretation of his more anom-
alous philosophies. It’s your per-
sonal creative quest after all.
Then comes part nine, the 
final section, aptly titled No End. 
Here, Thompson reminds read-
ers that we are, in fact, mere 
specs in the creative landscape 
of the universe. Anything we do 
has already been done in some 
variation; in the future, it will 
be redone in another. He does an 
impressive job of infusing per-
sonality into this section without 
making it emotional. In his way, 
Thompson is stating what we 
already know. In 
fact, he wants us 
to know that we 
already know, that 
even this realiza-
tion has already 
been 
made, 
by 
each of us, in our 
own heads.
“There is spe-
cies-wide 
pro-
gramming,” 
he 
writes, “and then there’s individ-
uality, and the overlap between 
those two opens up a space for 
creativity. Live in that space. 
I’m here to. Maybe I’ll see you 
around sometime.”
Each 
section 
offers 
up 
Thompson’s two cents, but, as 
I’ve said, he never tells us how 
to think of them. Rather, at the 
end of every section lies a blank 
sheet of graph paper. No prompt 
is given, only blank space. More 
than anything, that’s what “Cre-
ative Quest” provides readers: 
Space to be. Whether that being 
is creative in a prescribed way is 
not his concern. In his mind, the 
simple act of existing is enough 
to stir up genius.
To answer my earlier ques-
tion, yes. Questlove wrote a book. 
Or maybe it’s not a book. I’ll leave 
it up to you to decide.

Morning Alarm 

My 
people 
are 
famous.
You see them every 
day 
on 
the 
news- 
whether they are being 
evacuated, 
bombed, 
chemically 
attacked, 
or drowned.
If 
you 
have 
not 
guessed yet, I am Syr-
ian.
On the day of the 
Trump attack on Syria, 
we call my uncle to 
make sure that every-
thing is all right. As he 
tells us everything is 
fine, we can hear the 
sounds of the missiles 
in 
the 
background. 
When 
we 
mention 
this to my uncle, he 
says, “It’s fine, Trump 
woke us up for fajr 
(the morning prayer).” 

Knowing how unreli-
gious my uncle is, it is 
at least good to know 
that his sarcasm is 
intact.
Fast forward a few 
days later, and we hear 
about another attack 
that was close to where 
my family lives. Up 
until now, we are not 
even sure who admin-
istered the attack. I 
start anxiously mak-
ing some calls to my 
family, checking that 
everyone is all right. 
After a few nerve-
wracking 
minutes 
waiting for the phone 
to connect, I finally 
get ahold of them and 
ask if they are okay. At 
the end of our conver-
sation, my cousin says 
it was nice to know it 
takes a bombing for 
them to hear my voice.

Later that night as 
our family WhatsApp 
group chat goes back 
to its usual light atmo-
sphere, 
my 
cousin 
sends a casual picture 
of 
an 
undetonated 
bomb. Confused, my 
sister asks what that 
is. And so, my extend-
ed family kicked off a 
thorough explanation 
of the different kinds 
of weapons used, the 
effect of each and how 
to 
recognize 
them 
based on the sounds 
they make.
That is one of the 
true talents of a Syrian, 
they proudly explain. 
No matter how tough 
the situation has ever 
gotten 
back 
home, 
they have never failed 
to laugh about it and to 
figure out a way to add 
a touch of sarcasm.

I love makeup. I 
think it’s safe to say 
that makeup is one 
of the things people 
spend the most money 
on without realizing 
it. I can go to Sephora 
or even Walmart with 
just the intention of 
gazing at the makeup 
section, and end up 
leaving with $30 less in 
my wallet and between 
one and five different 
makeup products.
I wasn’t always into 
makeup. In middle 
school, 
I 
remem-
ber how many of my 
friends and classmates 
would coat their face 
with makeup every 
day just to hide their 
insecurities and give 
themselves a confi-
dence boost. In my 
mind, makeup was 
expensive, 
unneces-
sary, difficult to use 
and a coping mecha-
nism for not hav-
ing high self-worth. 
Because of these things 
I was never interested 
in makeup. I decided 
that only after I truly 
embraced who I was 
as a person and loved 
how I looked, with 
or without enhance-
ments, would I regu-
larly wear makeup.
My first real intro-
duction 
to 
makeup 
was when I started 
getting into theatre in 
middle school. I was 

one of the leads in our 
school musical, “Camp 
Rock,” and I had to 
wear makeup so that 
my face would stand 
out on stage. My moth-
er would always do 
my makeup before the 
rehearsals and shows 
because I didn’t own 
any or know how to put 
it on. I continued to do 
theatre in high school. 
I was soon at the age 
where I couldn’t just 
have my mom do my 
makeup for my shows 
anymore. Everyone in 
our theatre knew how 
to apply makeup them-
selves, 
using 
either 
their 
own 
makeup 
or the stage makeup 
owned by the school.
This is when prob-
lems started to arise for 
me as 1. I could not put 
on makeup myself 2. I 
did not own any make-
up 3. I couldn’t use any 
of the school’s makeup 
because it didn’t fit 
my skin tone and 4. 
Everyone in my the-
atre department was 
white and didn’t know 
how to apply makeup 
on me. Due to all of 
these limitations, I was 
forced to teach myself 
how to put on make-
up. I would sit in the 
corner of our makeup 
room at school, watch-
ing YouTube videos on 
how to apply eyeliner, 
what foundation was 
for, and what the dif-
ferent types of make-

up brushes were for. 
I also reached out to 
my friends who wore 
makeup for advice.
After 
putting 
on 
makeup in theatre, I 
started to enjoy doing 
makeup in general. 
As a creative person, I 
always loved looking 
for different ways to 
express myself, wheth-
er that was through 
writing, music, acting, 
dance, etc. I saw make-
up as a completely new 
way to express myself, 
so much more person-
al than any of the of the 
other forms. When you 
apply makeup, your 
face is the canvas and 
you have so many dif-
ferent options, choices 
and stylistic decisions 
you can make to deco-
rate it yourself. And 
even cooler is the fact 
that since everyone’s 
face is unique, every-
one has a different can-
vas to start out with 
that you need to learn 
to work with.
But my face, or can-
vas, soon started to 
make it harder for me 
find ways to express 
myself 
the 
way 
I 
wanted to. Originally, 
I would spend time 
watching 
Youtube 
videos to understand 
how to apply makeup 
and get ideas for dif-
ferent makeup looks. 
Most of the people that 
I watched in videos 
were white, but I didn’t

Beating your face as a Black Woman 

see that as something that 
mattered that much. That 
was until I tried to fol-
low the videos. Anytime I 
tried to do what I saw in 
the videos, I had trouble 
finding products to help 
me. I was never able to 
find 
foundations 
and 
concealers to perfectly fit 
my skin tone at my local 
drug stores. Whenever I 
applied eyeshadow, the 
colors wouldn’t appear 
on my eyelids because my 
skin was too dark. The 
bright lipsticks I would 
see women wear looked 
unnatural and unflat-
tering on my dark skin. I 
became increasingly frus-
trated with the amount of 
trial and error I had with 
all the makeup products 
I bought and how much 
time I’d have to spend 
looking for makeup that 
worked for me. It made 
me start to realize how 
many makeup products 
weren’t made for me or 
other Black women, and 
I became frustrated that 
I had to work twice as 
hard to find products that 
were extremely simple 
for other lighter skinned 
individuals to find.

I soon started watch-
ing 
makeup 
tutorials 
from other Black YouTu-
bers to help find makeup 
products that were more 
tailored to my skin tone. 
Though it did help, watch-
ing those videos could 
only do so much for me 
as it was so hard to find 
Black YouTubers who 
had the exact skin tone as 
me. So I still wasn’t able 
to see how different prod-
ucts would look on my 
skin tone without buying 
them first.
Though it was still 
frustrating, it was better 
than nothing and I con-
tinued to watch Black 
YouTubers’ 
makeup 
tutorial videos to learn 
which products to buy 
and how to apply makeup 
to my skin. Even though 
I couldn’t always use the 
videos to determine what 
to buy, and what not to 
buy, I was able to learn 
multiple tricks for women 
of darker skin to get 
makeup to look better on 
our complexion, such as 
using concealer on your 
eyelids to get eyeshadow 
to appear brighter and 
using lip liner to tone 

down too-bright lipsticks. 
I also took to following 
more Black makeup art-
ists on Instagram, like 
@somuchsimone, 
@
vurrsacee and @khloe-
dosh. This gave me more 
inspiration to be bolder 
and more creative with 
my makeup, showing me 
how to use my dark skin 
tone to my advantage 
instead of something to 
work around.
I now feel more confi-
dent in wearing makeup 
as a Black woman and 
know more tricks and 
skills to make makeup 
produced for a white 
audience work for me. 
I’ve even taken to doing 
makeup for my friends 
of different skin tones 
to explore how applying 
makeup differs with dif-
ferent shades and types of 
skin, that I like to show-
case on my Instagram, @
looksbyefe. I used to feel 
discouraged as a Black 
makeup artist, but I now 
embrace being a Black 
makeup user and choose 
to see the hardships it 
poses as just challenges 
for me to overcome in my 
artistic journey.

Fahey exits in first 
round of NCAA

Just a couple weeks after 
the Michigan women’s ten-
nis team ended its season, 
Kate Fahey was back on 
the court. But this time, 
the junior wasn’t compet-
ing for the team, she was 
competing for herself. 
“It’s kind of different 
going from seeing your five 
teammates around you to 
looking at random players 
around you,” Fahey said. 
“Not having any team-
mates here, it was a little 
bit sad. It’s a little bit dif-
ferent, but it’s a tennis 
match, so it’s not too bad.” 
Fahey’s hard 
work and suc-
cess 
from 
the 
fall 
and 
spring seasons 
earned 
her 
a spot in the 
NCAA Singles 
Tournament 
as the highest-
ranked Big Ten 
player. But in 
the end, Fahey 
wasn’t able to 
advance 
past 
the first round 
and 
fell 
in 
three sets, 6-3, 
3-6, 6-1. 
Fahey opened the tour-
nament 
on 
Wednesday 
afternoon, 
facing 
off 
against No. 3 Estela Per-
ez-Somarriba from Miami 
— an opponent she can’t 
seem to get away from in 
the postseason. In last sea-
son’s singles tournament, 
Perez-Somarriba 
ended 
Fahey’s tournament in the 
quarterfinals. 
And 
while 
Fahey 
couldn’t change the result, 
she did give herself a fight-
ing chance. With the score 
knotted at three in the first 
set, Perez-Somarriba broke 
Fahey’s serve and proceed-
ed to win three straight 
games to end the set. 
Fahey needed to make an 
adjustment. 

“I think I stepped in, 
up in the court a little bit 
more,” Fahey said. “I was 
more aggressive and took 
time away from her. She’s 
not really a player that will 
make unforced errors, so I 
kind of had to force her to 
make some errors. I think I 
did a good job of that in the 
second set.”
Fahey jumped out to a 
3-0 lead and looked poised 
to claim the second set. 
While 
Perez-Somarriba 
tried to get back into it, 
Fahey had too much of a 
lead. Braced with a 5-2 
advantage, Fahey fell into 
a 40-0 hole but rattled 
off four straight points to 
steal the set. 
The 
match 
was 
even 
headed 
into 
the third set, 
but 
Perez-
Somarriba 
ran away with 
a 
lead 
that 
Fahey 
never 
recovered 
from. 
Down 
5-0, 
Fahey 
managed 
to 
scrape out one 
game 
from 
Perez-Somar-
riba, but after 
a long cross-court rally, 
Fahey’s ball landed in the 
net, and she fell 6-1. 
“At 
this 
tournament, 
everyone’s good,” Fahey 
said. “So you have to go 
into every match thinking 
it’s going to be a battle. I 
had played her last year 
so I knew she was a really 
good player, but I wasn’t 
intimidated.”
With 
an 
impressive 
junior campaign under her 
belt in which Fahey went 
29-7 in the No. 1 slot, she 
is expected to have an even 
more 
impressive 
senior 
season. She made great 
strides in her game and 
continued to stay aggres-
sive, 
something 
she 
is 
eager to continue next sea-
son.

‘M’ loses in Sweet 16 to UCLA

WOMEN’S TENNIS

On the ninth shot of the 
rally, Runhao Hua watched 
the ball sail past him and 
pumped his fists in the air.
Hua — a senior on the No. 15 
Michigan men’s tennis team 
— secured the Wolverines’ 
second 
point 
of the day with 
his 
three-set 
victory 
over 
UCLA’s Evan 
Zhu, 
though 
his win would 
ultimately not 
be enough, as 
Michigan fell 
to the Bruins, 
4-2.
“He 
came 
out great, lost that second 
set, but he got on top in the 
third,” said Michigan coach 
Adam Steinberg. “We needed 
that because it gave us our 
second point, and he got off 
the court and gave confidence 
to (senior Davis Crocker) and 
(junior Myles Schalet). That’s 
a great win for him. To beat 
the No. 2 player from UCLA 
is terrific, good for his confi-
dence.”
The Wolverines came into 
the Sweet Sixteen matchup 
with quite a bit of momentum 
after shutout wins at home 
in the first two rounds of the 
NCAA Tournament. From 
the beginning of the doubles 
matches, the fighting spirit of 
Michigan was evident.

Each match was close, 
though the Wolverines were 
bested by the talented Bruins 
lineup and lost the doubles 
point. But Michigan’s abil-
ity to keep the matches close 
against No. 2 UCLA was a 
good sign for Steinberg.
“They were super motivat-
ed for this match,” Steinberg 
said. “I thought 
they 
fought 
amazing 
today. 
… It shows that 
we can compete 
with anyone in 
the country. They 
can 
compete 
with 
anybody 
from ranked No. 
1 in the country 
to 
wherever. 
I 
think it should 
give our program a lot of con-
fidence.”
Once the singles play start-
ed, the trend of close matches 
continued. Three of the six 
matches went to three sets — 
Hua at No. 2, Schalet at No. 3 
and Crocker at No. 6. But only 
one of those matches went 
the way of the Wolverines. 
The lone win — Hua’s 6-1, 
2-6, 6-1 victory — came after 
Michigan was already down 
3-1 and was too little, too late.
Moments after Hua’s win, 
Schalet lost his own three-
set match, leaving Crocker’s 
match unfinished. Crocker 
was leading in the third set, 
but both Schalet and Crocker 
would have had to win for the 
Wolverines to move on to the 

quarterfinals.
Freshman Mattias Siimar 
earned 
Michigan’s 
only 
straight-set win at the No. 4 
singles spot. Siimar was the 
only Wolverine to go unde-
feated through the three 
rounds of the NCAA tourna-
ment — and the only fresh-
man in the singles lineup.
“That was one of the best 
matches he’s played all year,” 
Steinberg said. “He played a 
complete match and served 
very well. I was happy for him 
that he got a win at the NCAA 
tournament — he deserved it 
today. He played very solid.”
Siimar is one of just three 
freshmen that saw playing 
time for Michigan this sea-
son in a lineup dominated 
by upperclassmen, includ-
ing four seniors. With the 
departure of seniors Carter 
Lin, Alex Knight, Hua and 
Crocker, the Wolverines will 
have quite a few spots to fill 
next year.
But after his team earned 
its first Sweet Sixteen berth 
in ten years, Steinberg has no 
plans to lower his expecta-
tions.
“We have four or five new 
freshmen coming in, and it’s 
going to be exciting,” Stein-
berg said. “I think this is a 
great springboard for what 
we want to do. It should 
be the norm to come to the 
Sweet Sixteen for the Univer-
sity of Michigan. It shouldn’t 
be a surprise when we do 
these things.”

Michigan was 
already down 
and it was too 
little, too late

BAILEY JOHNSON
Daily Sports Writer

Fahey fell into a 
40-0 hole 
but rattled off 
four straight 
points to steal 
the set.


It’s a play the Michigan 
baseball team (15-8 Big 
Ten, 33-19 overall) is all too 
familiar with.
The 
Wolverines 
were 
batting in the bottom of 
the frame in extra innings 
with bases loaded and the 
game on the line. A player 
stepped up and delivered a 
sacrifice fly to deep right 
field allowing the runner 
at third to score the win-
ning run. Michigan then 
mobbed the hitter who 
smacked the walk-off fly 
out.
It’s how the Wolverines 
downed Illinois, and it’s 
how they overcame Iowa 
(13-9, 33-19) in the first 
game of the Big Ten Tour-
nament.
The inning began with 
some pitching trouble for 
the Hawkeyes. Iowa reliev-
er Zach Daniels walked 
two 
consecutive 
batters 
on eight straight pitches 
prompting Iowa to make 
a much needed call to the 
bullpen. 
Right-hander 
Nick Nelsen entered the 
game and relented a quick 
infield single to junior cen-
ter fielder Jonathan Engel-
mann.
Then early on a Wednes-
day 
morning, 
freshman 
slugger 
Jesse 
Franklin 

stepped to the plate with 
bases loaded and delivered 
the sacrifice fly, giving 
Michigan a hard-fought 2-1 
win.
While the wild finish 
injected a healthy dose of 
drama into the contest, the 
game was a defensive bat-
tle, through and through.
Making 
diving 
catch 
after diving catch and web 
gem play after web gem 
play, the Wolverines were 
flashing the leather early 
and often to extinguish any 
life out of the Hawkeyes’ 
lineup.
“For us it felt like Michi-
gan had 15 fielders out 
there,” said Iowa coach 
Rick Heller. “You hit three 
balls off the pitcher and 
you don’t get a hit, and 
they’re making diving plays 
left and right, and it’s the 
same thing in the outfield. 
We made a nice play, and it 
went right at ‘em.”
And the tight defense 
began on the mound.
Both 
sides 
benefited 
from terrific outings on the 
mound with the Hawkeyes 
riding left-hander Nick All-
geyer through seven lights 
out innings. However, the 
Wolverines kicked things 
off with a fright from the 
bump.
After 
only 
pitching 
through one inning, sopho-
more left-hander Tommy 

Henry was nailed by a line 
drive. The ball rocketed 
off the bat of right field-
er Robert Neustrom and 
punched Henry straight in 
his throwing arm. Ever the 
warrior, Henry collected 
the ball and got the force-
out at first.
The injury put Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich in a dif-
ficult position. Try to keep 
Henry in or make a quick 
call to the bullpen and hope 
everything works out. See-
ing a happy medium, Baich 
kept the lefty in the game 
while senior right-hander 
Alec Rennard frantically 
warmed up in the bullpen. 
After Henry walked the 
next batter on five pitches, 
Bakich made the switch.
“I think it was easier 
coming in in the second 
than it would be coming 
in in the fourth or fifth 
because I was actually still 
warm from playing catch 
pre-game as bad as that 
sounds,” Rennard said. “So 
I went down to the bullpen 
and tossed as many fast-
balls as I could.”
Luckily 
for 
Rennard, 
he was allotted extra time 
to warm up due to the 
unpredictable 
nature 
of 
the event. Just as luck-
ily for Michigan, Rennard 
brought his A-game.
The righty would go 
on to pitch 5.2 innings of 

‘M’ walks off in a defensive 

battle against the Hawkeyes

scoreless relief while giv-
ing up only one hit — a 
bloop to right field that 
snuck just inside the foul 
line.
“Today was just getting 
back to that, ‘One pitch at 
a time,’ approach,” Ren-
nard said. “Sometimes the 
focus tries to broaden out 
and narrow focus on one 
pitch at a time, take care of 
this pitch and having short 
memory really helps.”
While 
both 
squads 
donned 
impressive 
defense 
and 
pitching 
throughout 
the 
game, 
offense was nowhere to be 
found. Attribute it to the 
size and scope of the park, 
the lights out pitching or 
big game nerves, neither 
team could buy a hit in the 
low-scoring affair.
The one shining light of 
offensive productivity and 
the 
Wolverines’ 
saving 
grace was Franklin. Aside 
from his heroic walk-off, 
the first-year crushed his 
10th home run of the year 
to right-center field in the 
fourth inning and also 
secured a double to deep 
left field in the sixth.
However, Franklin will 
be the first to celebrate the 
role of his teammates and 
give credit where credit is 
due. After committing an 
error earlier in the con-
test, Franklin was picked 
up by his teammates and 
sought to make amends for 
his misstep.
“There were like a mil-
lion other plays today 
that helped us win the 
game,” Franklin said. “A 
lot of guys picking each 
other up. Like, I made a 
poor error, and then the 
first thing that Alec Ren-
nard said was, ‘It doesn’t 
matter. Flush it.’ And that 
means a lot. He could’ve 
just yelled at me for mess-
ing up the beginning of his 
outing, but he didn’t.”
It’s great to see team 
cohesion on any level, 
but if Michigan has any 
chance of winning the Big 
Ten Tournament, it must 
be out in full force and 
guide the Wolverines to 
solid pitching, defense and 
timely hitting.
And a walk-off every 
now and then doesn’t hurt 
either.

Rennard performs 

with relief pitching

Just four batters into the 
Big Ten tournament, Michi-
gan encountered coach Erik 
Bakich’s 
worst 
nightmare. 
Iowa rightfielder Robert Neus-
trom ripped a line drive up the 
middle where it struck sopho-
more 
left-hander 
Tommy 
Henry in his pitching arm.
Henry fielded the ball to get 
the out, but after a long mound 
meeting and a five-pitch walk, 
it became apparent that he 
would be unable to continue.
As Henry tested his injured 
arm, senior right-hander Alec 
Rennard sprinted to the left 
field bullpen where he deliv-
ered a series of rapid-fire fast-
balls to freshman catcher Joe 
Donovan.
“Leading into the week, 
coach said, ‘All the rules go out 
the window,’ and, ‘Be prepared 
for anything, anytime,’ ” Ren-
nard said.
“I think it was easier com-
ing in in the second than it 
would be coming in in the 
fourth or fifth because I was 
actually still warm from play-
ing catch pre-game.”
That may have been the 
most stressful part of Ren-
nard’s outing. He gave up a 
quick bloop single, and a Jesse 
Franklin error allowed an 
inherited run to score.
After the error, Rennard 
faced the minimum over the 
next thirteen batters, allow-
ing just one base-runner and 
no hits.
“Alec 
Rennard 
stepping 
in and giving us 5 2/3 inning 
of scoreless relief was huge,” 
Bakich said.
Added Iowa coach Rick 
Heller: “When Henry went 
out, Rennard comes in and just 
does a really nice job — it’s just 
a really tough situation to be in, 
and he handled it extremely 
well and really was key to the 
game.”
Rennard was in a free fall 
heading into the tournament. 
The senior relented five earned 
runs in less than an inning two 
weeks ago against Illinois.
Three days earlier at Michi-

gan State, he gave up seven hits 
and two earned runs in just 
two and two-thirds innings.
All of that came after a har-
rowing season that he began 
as the Wolverines’ Friday 
starter. After missing seven 
weeks with an arm strain, the 
Michigan rotation’s dominant 
performances meant Rennard 
was resigned to bullpen duties.
“Today was just getting 
back to that, ‘One pitch at a 
time,’ approach,” Rennard said. 
“Sometimes the focus tries to 
broaden out and narrow focus 
on, ‘One pitch at a time, take 
care of this pitch’ and having 
short memory really helps.”
Before running into troubles 
down the stretch, Rennard ini-
tially handled his bullpen role 
admirably, giving up one run 
in his first 11 2/3 innings back 
from injury. Amid that stretch 
was a dominant performance 
against the Hawkeyes in which 
he pitched three and a third 
scoreless innings.
“When it’s game day, even 
if it’s not the specific situation 
that everyone expected, that 
I know I can give my team a 
chance to win.”
While the Wolverines lost 
that day in Iowa City, Ren-
nard’s performance Wednes-
day morning provided just the 
boost they needed to start the 
Big Ten Tournament in the 
win column.
For weeks, freshman right-
hander Jeff Criswell and junior 
left-hander William Tribucher 
have anchored the Michigan 
relief staff with inconsistent 
support from the rest of the 
bullpen.
Wednesday, those concerns 
were avoided as Rennard’s out-
ing meant Bakich could bypass 
— and rest — his middle reliev-
ers and turn the ball over to 
Criswell in the eighth.
Two innings later, fresh-
man 
first 
baseman 
Jesse 
Franklin 
walked 
off 
the 
Hawkeyes with a sacrifice fly 
to right field. While the ensu-
ing celebrations paint Franklin 
as the Wolverines’ hero, Ren-
nard’s lights out pitching was 
just as vital.

The end of the road

Call it a collapse.
Maybe that’s what it was. Losing 
four out of your last five games — the 
fifth by squandering a one-run lead in 
the sixth inning of an elimination con-
test — certainly qualifies.
But maybe the end for the Michi-
gan softball team was less of a collapse 
and more of an inevitability, a train 
barreling out of control with noth-
ing to stop it until its unceremonious 
crash. Maybe this was where the sea-
son was destined to head. Maybe the 
issues that plagued the Wolverines 
were always there and just hiding in 
the periphery.
In NCAA Regionals, it was Notre 
Dame’s Alexis Holloway who outdu-
eled freshman left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien twice — holding Michigan 
to two runs on seven hits across the 
two games. That’s a tough spot for any 
ace.
Maybe it isn’t such a shock. Hollo-
way, Michigan State pitcher Kristina 
Zalewski and Ohio State pitcher Shel-
by McCombs all beat the Wolverines 
down the stretch. All have something 
in common: a devastating changeup. 
Each time, Michigan could do nothing 
with it. It was a weakness the Fighting 
Irish were happy to exploit.
And when the hits don’t fall in, 
it’s easy to get in your head, to press, 
to have your courage dissipate until 
there’s nothing left except a mark in 
the loss column. For the Wolverines, 
it’s been a common theme.
“They’ve spent a lot of time worry-
ing about all the worst things that can 
happen, and I think that makes bad 
things happen,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins after Friday’s defeat. 
“ … We were a little paralyzed by our 
fear.”
Anyone would be if they weren’t 
used to losing. And the Wolverines’ 
real problem wasn’t that they had 
weaknesses — every team does — but 
that winning concealed the cracks in 
the foundation.
During conference play, Michi-
gan feasted on Big Ten pitching, a 
crop that was mediocre at best and 
outright terrible at worst. Even then, 
there was some vulnerability. In one 
game against Penn State, the Wolver-
ines failed to score until the seventh 
because the changeup kept them off-
balance. And the Big Ten Tournament 
wasn’t their first look at Zalewski — 
the first time, she also gave the bats 
trouble in an eventual 1-0 Michigan 

win. But even if the Wolverines knew 
of their flaw, most opposing pitchers 
lacked a consistent changeup, giv-
ing them little opportunity to adjust 
before that pitfall was exposed on the 
biggest stage.
And throughout the season, the 
refrains were there, the signs that 
Michigan’s struggles had never really 
gone away.
“I think the biggest thing that was 
getting us was her changeup,” said 
freshman designated player Lou Allan 
after the series against the Nittany 
Lions last month.
Junior center fielder Natalie Peters 
expressed the same after Friday’s 
game when Holloway’s changeup 
generated nothing but weak contact.
“They try too hard,” Hutchins said 
after the Texas Invitational in Feb-
ruary — a tournament that included 
losses to Virginia Tech and Texas. “ 
… They’re making hitting more than 
it is.”
Following an April defeat to Indi-
ana — in which the Wolverines 
struggled to come through in clutch 
situations and left 11 runners on base 
— her sentiments were remarkably 
similar.
“(In our losses) we were not confi-
dent,” Hutchins said after the Texas 
Invitational. “We had too many dis-
tractions in our head.”
And again in the postseason, 
Michigan fell victim to a lack of trust 
in itself.
The signs were easy to ignore as the 
Wolverines tore through the confer-
ence, but looking back, they were there 
all along. They were there in Michi-
gan’s early-season struggles, there 
against the Spartans and Penn State, 
there in narrow late-season escapes 
against the Buckeyes and Hoosiers.
And ultimately, they were weak-
nesses that other teams picked up on. 
The Big Ten Tournament was the first 
domino and from there, it only cas-
caded. It showed in the hitters, frozen 
as another changeup whizzed by. It 
showed in the defense, so rushed to 
make plays that it made uncharacter-
istic errors. It showed in the way Notre 
Dame looked like a more poised and 
prepared team every step of the way.
Maybe it was a collapse. It was cer-
tainly a fall from grace.
But more than that, it was a simple 
realization that maybe, just maybe, 
this team wasn’t as good as it seemed.

‘M’ loses in Regionals

The Wolverines’ season culminated 
in a pitchers’ duel.
Coming off of a 6-0 victory against 
Illinois-Chicago, it seemed as though 
the Michigan softball team’s bats 
had finally come alive after scoring a 
total of two runs over their previous 
three games. Senior utility player Tera 
Blanco hit her first home run in over a 
month and drove in her first runs since 
April 22 against Maryland. JAnd fresh-
man left-hander Meghan Beaubien 
nearly tossed a no-hitter, surrendering 
her first hit in the final inning against 
the Flames. Even the two errors com-
mitted by the Wolverine defense were 
covered up by the pitching and offense. 
 
However, nothing that came easy 
against Illinois-Chicago came easy 
against Notre Dame. This time, there 
was no room for error.
On Sunday afternoon, Michigan 
took on the Fighting Irish for the sec-
ond time at the Lexington Regional. 
The two teams squared off in the open-
ing game of the Regional which saw 
Notre Dame defeat the Wolverines 4-1. 
Unlike before, however, both teams 
were playing for their postseason lives 
— having already used up their leeway 
for losing.
Right-hander Alex Holloway—who 
gave Michigan trouble on Friday— 
took the circle again against Beaubien. 
The two freshman pitchers battled, 
keeping the game scoreless through 
five innings—thanks in-part to the 
stingy defensive play of both teams.
In the top of the second, sopho-
more outfielder Haley Hoogenraad 
launched a ball deep to left field. Rang-
ing back towards the warning track, 
Ally Wester reached up at the wall and 
made the catch as she robbed Hoogen-
raad of a home run to keep the game 
scoreless.
In the bottom half of the inning, 
third baseman Melissa Rochford led 
off and drilled a ground ball between 
Blanco at first base and second base-
man Faith Canfield. Canfield ranged 
to her left and laid out to make a diving 
stop, throwing out Rochford from her 
knees.
The two teams struggled offensive-
ly through five innings –– threatening 
but never scoring.
The Wolverines finally broke the 
scoreless tie in the sixth inning, start-
ing with a one-out walk. A single to 
right field by sophomore third base-
man Madison Uden advanced Can-
field to third base. She crossed home 
plate on a sacrifice fly from freshman 
designated player Lou Allan.

Their first lead against Notre Dame 
in the Regionals didn’t last long.
The Fighting Irish led off the bot-
tom half of the inning with a double. 
Then Michigan’s defense, which had 
been shaky in recent weeks, continued 
its struggles. A pop fly from shortstop 
Morgan Reed was hit to shallow left 
field behind freshman shortstop Nata-
lia Rodriguez. Rodriguez ranged back-
wards and Hoogenraad and junior 
outfielder Natalie Peters sprinted 
forward, converging in no-man’s land 
where a lack of communication result-
ed in the ball dropping between the 
three players. There were now runners 
on second and third with no outs.
“Defense has been our strength 
all year,” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins, “and I don’t know where it 
went. I guess I’ll spend some time try-
ing to figure it out. We’ve done a lot of 
great things this year, but these last 
couple of weeks has not been our best 
ball.”
A sacrifice fly drove in the first run 
to tie the game, 1-1. And a single by 
Rochford gave the Fighting Irish a 2-1 
lead.
Just as quickly as the Wolverines 
took the lead, they saw it slip away.
They escaped the inning, though, 
keeping the deficit to one run— but 
they now needed to score a run to keep 
their postseason alive.
Senior right fielder Aidan Falk led 
off the seventh inning with a double to 
left field in what was her final at bat for 
Michigan. Senior utility player Nikki 
Wald was called out of the box on a sac-
rifice bunt attempt, and Peters flew out 
to the shortstop in foul territory. With 
their backs against the wall, one out 
away from going home, Blanco stepped 
up to the plate.
For the Wolverines, you couldn’t ask 
for anyone else at the plate with the sea-
son on the line –– the star dual-threat 
senior who has come up with several 
big hits in her career. But Blanco fouled 
off several pitches, getting herself in a 
1-2 count, before watching strike three 
catch the outside edge of the plate and 
the season come to a close.
For the second straight year and the 
third time since 2004, the Wolverines 
did not advance past Regionals.
This time they are losing a pair of 
starting seniors in Blanco and Falk.
“I think it was a tough way to go 
out,” said Uden. “I am extremely grate-
ful for the senior class that we had. 
They contributed a lot to turn the pro-
gram around, from losing a couple key 
players – they stepped it up. You know, 
that’s all you can be thankful for, you 
know, to be here and play for the Big 
Blue and the people around you.”
