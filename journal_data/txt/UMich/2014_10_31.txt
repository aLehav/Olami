'U' plans to increase
enforcement for
weekend festivities
By GENEVIEVE HUMMER
Daily Staff Reporter
With Halloween and Home-
coming this weekend, Univer-
sity officials are encouraging
students to keep safety in mind
while celebrating during these
festivities.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, University Police
Chief Robert Neumann said the
University plans to work with the
Ann Arbor Police Department to
increase enforcement over the
weekend. He also stressed the
role of the larger community in
ensuring public safety.
"It's really a collaborative
effort with everyone being obser-
vant to those that need help and
taking action when you see some-
thing that needs to be done,"
Neumann said.
He said students often have
the tendency to ignore dangerous
situations, and encouraged stu-
dents to avoid taking drinks from

a common container and to never
leave a drink unattended.
Wolverine Wellness . Direc-
tor Mary Jo Desprez said these
celebrations have the potential
to compromise student safety.
However, she added that it is pos-
sible for students to stay safe and
have fun.
"Nobody wants to ruin any-
body's fun; our goal is that every-
one has a blast and that there's
also this culture of caring for
each other, and not just car-
ing that you take care of some-
body, but not letting them get
to the point where they're sick,"
Desprez said.
Desprez outlined similar pro-
tocols to Neumann's. She empha-
sized having a plan: eat before
drinking, space out drinks and
limit the amount of liquor con-
sumed. Desprez noted that the
student-designed Stay in the Blue
app can help students track their
drinking, which was launched in
2013 in partnership with the Uni-
versity Health System's alcohol
safety program. The app, which
has been downloaded more than
6,000 times, calculates blood
alcohol content based upon

difficulty in hiring

By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
In his inaugural address last
month, University President
Mark Schlissel was clear about

the role socio-economic status
should play in a student's ability
to attend the University.
"Students and their parents
must hear clearly and rest secure
that the University of Michigan
values curiosity and intellect,
not ZIP codes or family income,"
he said.
However, the socio-economic
status of the University's under-
graduate population is not even-
ly distributed. In Fall 2011, 63
percent of incoming freshmen

reported family incomes over
$100,000, according to the office
of the Registrar. A 2012 survey
by the U.S. Census Bureau stated
the median family income in the
United States is $51,324.
In addition to the challenges
in ensuring access to higher edu-
cation for students from lower
socio-economic backgrounds,
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent for student life, said in a
September interview with The
Michigan Daily the University's

difficulty finding students to
fill campus jobs could be a side
effect of the higher-than-aver-
age family income for University
students.

dent body could be one reason

Regent Kathy White (D), the
2014 chair of the University's
Board of Regents, is running for

her third consecutive term on
the board with the goal of con-

White is currently a Profes-

Latest polls show
race tightening
with Schauer
By EMMA KINERY
For the Daily
As the election approaches,
the self-proclaimed "comeback
kid" of Michigan, incumbent

Republican Gov: Rick Snyder,
hopes to return for a second
term.
A central theme of his cam-
paign has been continuing to
build a solid foundation for
Michigan's economic revitaliza-
tion. In a conference call to col-
lege students earlier this month,
Snyder highlighted his plans
to create 300,000 new private
sector jobs. This expansion is

in addition to the $1.1 billion
investment Snyder has made in
K-12 education, and the elimi-
nation of the state's $1.5 billion
deficit.
Democratic candidate Mark
Schauer is opposing Snyder in
the gubernatorial election. And
according to the most recent
polls, the race will be close.

Kelly said the city will profit
from development projects in
the next two years and that these
funds earmarked for these pro-
grams should be directed toward
lowering debt. Decreased debt
will lead to lowered taxes, which
Kelly believes is critical to the
city's growth.
Taylor noted that the Ann
Arbor bond rate has been highly
rated by rating agencies. He said
while the city needs to keep track
of itsobligations, Ann Arbor does
not have a debt problem.
"It is our obligation to repay
the debt that we have incurred.
We do not incur debt without
a robust plan to pay it back and
an excellent reason for incurring
the debt. We do not incur debt
for operational expenses, we
incur debt for capital expenses
and that's good practice," Taylor
said.
Homelessness and
affordable housing
Another issue largely down-
played during this election are
the challenges faced by Ann
Arbor's homeless population.
Last winter, the City Council
faced issues of housing those
sleeping in the street during the
cold winter and debated dif-
ferent ways to best keep at-risk
individuals safe. However, the
problem is still present year-
round.
"The real fix to homeless-
ness is housing and services to
get people ready to support that
housing through employment,"
Taylor said. "We need to make
sure that people who need a
hand up get a hand up and that
there are jobs available for them
and that houses and that homes
are affordable."
Taylor noted that the city has
limited resources and the hous-
ing market is a key determiner

ENROLLMENT
From Page 1A
students may be less likely to seek
a campus job.
While Steve Mangan, Univer-
sity director of dining, wrote in
an e-mail that he didn't feel com-
fortable speculating about the
cause of the trend, he said there
has been a noticeable change over
the past few years in the availabil-
ity of student workers.
"This year has been particular-
ly challenging to fill the number
of positions we need at the begin-
ning of the fall term, specifically
for dining and recreational sports
and positions in the Unions," said
University Housing Spokesman
Peter Logan in an interview.
The University's Student Life
Auxiliaries, which includes
University Housing, University
Unions and Recreational Sports,
facilitates approximately 4,000
jobs for students per year, includ-
ing summer positions. Six hun-
dred jobs are offered for students
in University Housing, 1,800
jobs in Michigan Dining, 600 in
University Unions, 700 in Recre-
ational Sports and 200 in Confer-
ence and Event Services.
over the past two years Student
Life Auxiliaries have increased
the number of job opportunities
as theyhave enhanced dining ser-
vices and facilities and increased
the number of positions within
the unions and Recreational
Sports.
To meet those needs and
address declining student avail-
ability for campus jobs, Student
Auxiliaries have undertaken a
more aggressive effort to recruit
students this year, hosting three
job fairs, using direct mail and
stationing student ambassadors

at summer orientation to answer
the questions of students and par-
ents.
"(These efforts) have not
brought forth the number of
applicants we would like to have
in the student auxiliaries to get
started in the season," Logan
said.
In August, Michigan Dining
hired approximately 150 non-stu-
dent temporary workers to help
make up from empty student job
positions and an increased need
as the new Central Campus din-
ing operation opened in South
Quad.
Logan said one explanation for
the trend could be as the num-
ber of freshman applications
increase, admissions standards
rise and the types of students
who attend the University are
even more focused on excellingin
their academic and extra-curric-
ular pursuits.
"It just may be as Michigan
has become more competitive,
the students we are receiving are
perhaps more inclined to put aca-
demics first," he said.
Ifthis trend continues, whatev-
er the reasons, Logan said it could
have important consequences.
"Not having as many students
as we need can influence our
operational cost," he said. "We
need a considerable student work-
force to help us with our delivery
of services and programs."
Outside of Student Auxiliaries,
the Office of Student Employ-
ment posts more than4,000 job
opportunities, including work-
study and non-work-study posi-
tions. Those employment rates
have remained fairly stable, rang-
ing from a high of 3,775 and alow
of 3,573 occupied positions.
The Work-Study program,
funded by the U.S. Department
of Education, provides part time

jobs for students to assist them
in paying for tuition. These jobs
could range from teaching read-
ing in a preschool classroom to
working as a lab assistant or at a
University library.
"Student employees provide
an important portion of the local
workforce, whether Work-Study
or non-Work-Study," Susan Frier-
son, assistant director for Student
Employment wrote in an e-mail
interview. "Like all staff every-
where, they contribute to the
workflow of offices and organiza-
tions, both on and off campus."
Education senior Joe Cooling
funds his tuition through income
he earns from his campus jobs,
as well as scholarships from the
University's Office of Financial
Aid, summer job income and
some student loans.
"I would definitely say it has
been a financial need to fund my
education," he said.
LSA junior Victoria Rilett also
funds the entirety of her tuition
with an LSA merit scholarship
and the income she earns from
campus and summer jobs.
Rilett works 12 hours a week,
split between the Towsley Chil-
dren's House, the Center for
Educational Outreach and as a
student assistant for the Lloyd
Hall Scholars Program.
Rilett worked 50- to 60- hour
weeks this summer in a psychol-
ogy lab through the University's
Undergraduate Research Pro-
gram and at Pizza House to earn
enough to pay this semester's
tuition.
"The culture of my town is that
you have a job, all of my friends
had jobs, I've had a job since I was
16 years old," Rilett said. "I didn't
realize how wealthy certain peo-
ple are and how much that would
affect their college experience."
After arriving on campus her

freshman year, she said she real-
ized the type of money her peers
were spending on dinners in
restaurants, movie tickets and
clothes was different from her
own.
"The hard part was I had alot
of friends whose parents would
pay for them to go out and go
shopping and buy dinner and my
parents don't do that," Rilett said.
"I needed to get a job or find dif-
ferent friends."
LSA sophomore Noah Holton-
Raphael does not have a job on
campus. He receives $300 a
month from his parents for per-
sonal expenses, including food,
trips, activities and clothing,
though he worked this past sum-
mer in the food service industry
to save money for these types of
expenditures.
"I haven't needed a job, as of
yet, but I'll probably be getting a
job next semester," he said.
Despite anecdotal evidence
that changing family incomes are
influencing student employment,
there is a lack of available data to
offer a conclusive explanation.
The University's enrollment
figures do not include data on
family income, since the Free
Application for Federal Student
Aid is the entity that collects
information on an applicant's
family income.
The most recently available
figures report the families of 76
percent of the University's out-
of-state undergraduates earn
more than $150,000 annually,
compared to 72 percent in 2002.
For in-state students, 59 percent
of in-state students in 2002 had
family incomes greater than
$150,000. By 2012 that number
shrank to 50 percent, according
to figures from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education listed in the
University's most recent Office

of Budget and Planning alma-
nac.
Though this data does not
paint the entire picture, since
applicants who did not apply for
financial aid through FAFSA are
included in the category of family
incomes over $150,000, the num-
bers do illustrate a rough view of
the student body's socio-econom-
ic composition.
"For in-state students, we're
actually seeing increased socio-
economic diversity," University
Provost Martha Pollack said in
an interview in early October. "It
hasn't really gotten worse, but
where we haven't seen a change,
is out of state."
However, the data does not
disaggregate incomes over
$150,000. University spokesman
Rick Fitzgerald said the Univer-
sity does not collect separate data
on family income, apart from
the information it receives from
FAFSA.
"There is no appropriate way to
ask students what their family's
income is," he said.
In recent years, the University
has ramped up financial support
for in-state students, financed in
part by out-of-state students who
enroll at the University and can
pay the full tuition cost.
Still, the University has
pledged to improve affordability
and University access as part of a
larger effort to increase student-
body diversity.
"It certainly affects the nature
of the community if we don't pro-
vide adequate financial aid, and
the student body as aconsequence
on average becomes wealthier
and wealthier," Schlissel said in
an October interview with the
Daily. "Because that doesn't lead
necessarily to the kind of diver-
sity that will help your education
be as good as it can be."

weight and frequency, type and
amount of alcohol consumed.
Desprez said it is important
to acknowledge that drinking
is not a partof everyone's social
life.
"It's always okay not to
drink, and we actually have a
lot of students on campus who
don't drink and for lots of dif-
ferent reasons," Desprez said.
"Some don't drink because of
religious reasons, some don't
drink because they're on medi-
cine, some don't drink because
they're on probation and some
don't drink because they're in
recovery."
To provide alternative
opportunities this weekend,
PULSE, Sexperteam, Diversity
Peer Educators and the Expect
Respectcampaign are sponsor-
ing a Halloween tailgate on the
Diag Saturday. The event will
feature a photo booth, games,
free food and face painting.
Christina Gerazounis, a
health educator at Univer-
sity Health Service and staff
adviser to PULSE, said vari-
ous student organizations,
including many sponsoring the
Halloween Diag tailgate, have
spent the week "reverse trick-
or-treating" with participants
distributing candy, T-shirts,
water bottles and safe sex kits
to students on campus.
"They are engaging students
on campus on how they plan to
have a safe and fun Halloween
weekend," Gerazounis said.
"And so the biggest point is to
actually engage them and hear
from them instead of them just
taking free stuff."

gubernatorial candidate Mark
Schauer, U.S. Senate candidate
Gary Peters, congressional can-

In addition to direct engage-
ment, many candidates realize
that while students may not be
watching as much TV as they
used to, social media and video
sharing platforms are an increas-
ingly effective tool to mobilize
the millennial generation voter.
"YouTube humor videos may
now have opening political ads
tied to the congressional dis-
trict," wrote Peter Levine, direc-
tor of the Center for Information
and Research on Civic Learning
and Engagement at Tufts Uni-
versity, in an e-mail interview.
"There have even been ad place-
ments within video games."
While he said campaigning in
this way will catch the attention
of more students, Levine added
that "door-to-door and face-to-
face campaigning have always
been effective with young people
and remain most important."
While communicating effec-
tively with students is important,

Higher Education Funding
When Snyder took office in
2011, he faced a severe $1.4 bil-
lion shortfall in the state budget,
which resulted in a controversial
15-percent cut to higher educa-
tion funding.
Since then, he has, gradually
raised state funding for education
every fiscal year until it meets the
original rate, raising it 3.1 percent
in 2012, 2.2 percent in 2013 and
6.1 percent in 2014. Schauer, cam-
paigning as the "education gov-
ernor," focused his campaign on
Snyder's initial cuts, arguing that
the Governor has taken too long
to return to pre-cut levels and
promising a efforts to reverse the
cuts if elected. However, univer-
sities across the state, including
Michigan State University, the
University of Michigan and East-
ern Michigan University, have
responded well to Snyder's series
of increases after the initial cut.
In addition, Snyder has altered
the way that appropriations will
be allocated to universities in
2015. The plan for 2015 will fac-
tor in key criteria such as admin-

that it is just as important to
focus on the issues that college
students are most passionate
about.
Dolan, Levine, and LSA senior
Gabriel Leaf, chair of the Univer-
sity's chapter of College Repub-
licans, agree that the issues
affecting college students most
are fiscally related.
Accordingto the Campus Vote
Project, a national campaign run
by the Fair Elections Legal Net-
work to make voting more acces-
sible to students, average state
funding for higher education
has declined about 23 percent,
or $2,026 per student since the
recession in 2008. Dolan added
that certain social issues, such as
pay equality for women and anti-
discrimination policies for the
LGBTQ community, are of great
concern to students as they pre-
pare to enter the workforce.
While these issues will
impact college students more
directly than any other demo-
graphic, opinions differ over
whether issue-based mobiliza-
tion is a factor when college stu-
dents decide for whom they are
goingto vote.
"Young people vote on a can-
didate because of their stance on
one or two issues," Leaf wrote.
He contends the issues they
consider when voting are often
influenced by the beliefs of their
parents.

Levine, however disagreed:
"It's rare for someone to be moti-
vated by only one issue unless
it functions as a tie-breaker
(between candidates)."
He does agree with Dolan that
students vote for candidates with
whom they share certain beliefs,
such as ideology and political
party.
Despite the candidates' best
efforts, it may be optimistic to
believe that students who vote
next Tuesday will be the best
informed on the issues and the
candidates.
"For many of us, this is our
first election cycle and it is hard
to stay well-informed," Leaf
wrote.
Levine said campaign aware-
ness varies, but voters are par-
ticularly less informed when it
comes tostate and local elections
as these are "poorly covered in
the media that young people
read."
While how, and with what
arsenal, candidates reach out to
college students differs, Dolan,
Levine and Leaf all said the stu-
dent vote is invaluable.
Dolan characterized the
stakes by quoting Debbie Dingell,
Democratic nominee for the U.S.
Representative seat left vacant
by her husband.
"Young people are 25 percent
of our population and 100 per-
cent of our future."

cal engineering and computer
science and obtained her Juris
Doctor from the University of
Washington in 1991. She com-
pleted her Master of Laws degree
at George Washington University
Law School in 1996. Recently, she
received her master's degree in
Strategic Studies from the U.S.
Army War College in Carlisle Bar-
racks, Penn.
White was elected to the Board
of Regents in 1998 and reelected
in 2006. She said her initial deci-
sion to run was partly inspired by
an interest in promoting diversity
on campus.
"I was very passionate about
making sure diversity was a con-
cern for the institution," White
said.
As calls for increasing minority
enrollment echo across campus,
White said she has been listening
attentivelyto students about cam-
pus issues for years.
"I find that the young people
today are very interested in mak-
ing sure there is equality' for'
everyone in a way that I didn't
see as much when I was younger

and I didn't see it as much twenty
years ago," White said. "There is a
real demand for equality, engage-
ment and interaction. I think that
is what is really different."
White said she is passionate
about igniting change through
creating opportunities for civil
discourse on campus.
"Universities are a place where
hopefully we get people from all
different socioeconomic back-
grounds, races, countries and
states tocome together in this one
place where they can learn from
each other and share perspec-
tives," she said.
Creatingcivil discourse, exam-
ining structural problems and
aiming to have students engage
with each other are all goals
White said she has prioritized in
past terms as a regent and will
continue to prioritize if re-elect-
ed.
White has spearheaded and
established projects during her
time as regent to make in-state
tuition available for all veterans.
As of January 2014, students who
have served in the military will be
eligible for in-state tuition.
"I think it really helps to have
young people who have had dif-
ferent experiences, who are
maybe a little bit older, but have

really experienced things that the
rest of our society needs to learn
about," White said.
A priority for White through-
out her experience on the board
has been overseeing the Univer-
sity's endowment. White said she
aided in cost containment efforts,
reducing costs of the general fund
by $235 million between 2004
and 2012 and plans for an addi-
tional $120 million in reductions
by 2017.
White helped preserve the
endowment by smoothing out
returns, she said. When the
endowment returns are high the
amount of money distributed
to departments can be slightly
limited or saved. This is done so
when the endowment returns are
low there is more to distribute to
departments.
"It helps preserve the corpus of
the investment," White said. "The
theory is over time if you strain
spending, you can grow the cor-
pus more and more and there is
more available in later years."
White discussed the financial
impact of previous cuts to fund-
ing, specifically in 2011 when state
appropriations were reduced by
15 percent.

along with six-year graduation

areas.
Schools have supported the
metrics program in the past. The
criteria in previous years did not
include Pell Grants as a metric,
though, and universities, such as
Wayne State University and East-
ern Michigan University, voiced
concerns over this omission.
Without it, the universities said,
the metrics did not account for

In the conference call, Snyder

palities, which economized IT

This system would allow for bet-

government and the universities

duced former Democratic Gover-

much a university can increase its
tuition cost every year.
The current cap in place for the
2014-2015 school year is 3.75 per-
cent. Next year the cap will drop
to 3.2 percent. To compensate,
Snyder is increasing state appro-
priations for higher education by
6.1 percent.
Equal Pay Protections
Snyder has been repeatedly
criticized by the Democrats for
not taking more action to com-
bat pay discrimination against
women. The governor, in the
conference call, emphasized that
he "work(s) hard" in all areas to
promote equal pay. Last year he
stated that he would be open to a
discussion on the issue, but so far
has not offered a specific plan.

When words are not enough

6I

n a few days, college applications will be
due. In the last month, the high school
studentsItutor and afewold friendshave
bombarded me with essays
at various stages of the revi-
sion process. It's fun for the
most part, partly because'
I get to see a glimpse of my
students' lives outside the
specific academic subject t
I'm tutoring, but also partly
because it gives me a weird J
sense of nostalgia. It's this WANG
mix of panic and excitement
for what's to come. With
some of my students, I take
this chance to sit down with them and ask, "So
why do you want to go to this school?"
My first Festifall experience two years ago
was - like it might've been for the other
freshmen walking around - overwhelming.
My friend and Itoured every booth, signing our
names onto listservs before the person standing
across from us finished their spiel. When we
couldn't find a specific club we were looking for,
we asked around and got directed to the area
"right next to Dana." We ended up getting more
lost. By the end of the day, our backpacks were
filled with flyers, candy bars and pens; by the
end of the week, my inbox had become flooded
with invitations to go to mass meetings, only a
handful of which I managed to attend.
When I ask my students whythey wantto get
accepted into their top-choice schools, I usu-
ally get this recurring answer: "It's one of the
best in the nation." Or, if they've done a little
more research, "It has one of the best ____
programs in the nation." Most supplementary
essays ask the same question, and my students
usuallygivethatsame"It'satopschool"answer,
though with a bit of personal flair sprinkled in.
"Maybe," I suggest to them, "it's a good idea
to understand the student body and faculty
makeup there. Maybe look up class sizes and
teaching philosophies. Maybe explore the
campus culture and see if you are a good fit.
Visit the campus, schedule an informational
interview with an alumni, anything to get
you more acquainted." It's difficult for me to
stress to them the importance of school culture
and classroom teaching styles. Our majors

and interests might change, but who we're
surrounded by doesn't.
Things have settled a bit since the chaotic
confusion that made up my freshman year. I've
declared my major, I've narrowed downto four
clubs/organizations, I've made little social cir-
cles that I fit into, and I have a better grasp of
my post-graduate aspirations. The onlything is
it took several semesters to completely rethink
my goals (for example, should I really take this
creative writing thing seriously, or should I go
with what I came here for - STEM?), and sub-
sequently several peers and mentors to patient-
ly directme to where I really wanted to go.
I tell my students that the University of
Michigan is a big school. They'll be able to make
it however they want. The downside to that
is it's really easy to get lost among the crowd.
I tell them there are a lot of students who are
doing splendidly - grades-wise, social life-
wise, accomplishments-wise. But we don't
really hear from the students who are strug-
gling: the ones who don't know what to do with
their degrees, the ones who can't keep up with
the rigor of their major or the ones who realize
halfway through thatcthey don't want to do this
anymore. The University doesn't go out of its
way to seek out these students, so it's really up
to the individual to let the school know.
"It's hard to reach out to advisors you
might not know, or see the professor to talk
about that recent test score. Unless you feel
absolutely comfortable with them, it'll be easier
to wait another day," I say to my students. "And
before you know it, the end of the semester is
approaching."
I tell my students to stay conscientious. I
tell them to strive for their goals and passions
while also keeping an open mind. I tell them
to prioritize their learning but not at the
expense of their physical and mental wellbeing.
Sometimes, I tell them this with a sense of
hypocrisy, knowing that I've committed the
very errors I tell them to avoid. In the end,
though, my only wish is that they choose a
school where they get the most out of their
learning, and hopefully they will take a little
less time to get there than I did.

Within the halls of Grosse Pointe
South High School is the small room
144. It consists of a separate phone
room, 12 computers and a number of
the most dedicated students in the
school at any time between 7 a.m.
and as late as 9 p.m., committed to
the continued production of The
Tower newspaper. A weekly tradi-
tion since 1928, Jeff was the paper's
advisor, only the third in its history.
The paper was a powerhouse,
winning Best in Show awards and
Pacemaker Awards on the national
scale despite its four-day produc-
tion cycle, and Jeff was its consum-
mate advisor who always deflected
allthe attention and gloryto his stu-
dents for their work. But if it was us
students who were the engine of the
paper, Jeff was always the one mak-
ing sure our engine had the fuel and
maintenance to keep going.
It took an entire year class of
training alone to be a staff member.
Weeks spent on writing effective
leads, an overview of all law associ-
ated with student journalism, prac-
tice with interviews and mastery of
all the little things that Jeff knew

were integral to being a good writer.
And like the true teacher he was,
Jeff demanded perfection, in the
nicest way possible.
Once I joined The Tower staff,
every high school morning started
with me walking into the Tower
Room a few minutes after the bell
rang. Jeff would promptly call me a
knucklehead or some other word of
endearment, knowing I had no rea-
son for my untimeliness. And every
Monday night, our deadline night,
ended with words of "Go home, do
your homework for once." But for all
the time spent together in the Tower
Room, allthe paperbusiness and sto-
ries we discussed, the times I remem-
ber most were words of "David, how
are you?" when things were tough,
because Jeff was the best a teach-
er could be by every definition of
the word.
Last year, just before walking
into Spartan Stadium to see the
Michigan vs. Michigan State foot-
ball game, I got a call from a friend
from high school, a former editor
of our school paper. The call was
just a few simple words, that Jeff's
battle with cancer was coming to an
end other than which we had hoped
for. Jeff was a model Spartan fan,
and I had planned to talk football
with him and perhaps some words
of rivalry trash talk after watching
the Wolverines win in Spartan ter-
ritory; neither would happen.
During the game I stood in the
middle of the Michigan State stu-
dent section that I had snuck into,
rain jacket covering up all my maize
gear as my team was battered, dom-
inated and dismantled in every way
possible. The jacket partly covered
up the shame of defeat, and partly
kept me dry from the pounding rain
and sheltered from the cold tem-
peratures. Yet still my face was wet
because rain jackets do not keep you
dry from tears.
Jeff would die a few days later,
one year ago. I use the word "die"

instead of phrases liked "passed
away,"because it was what he taught
us to do. Journalism is not meant
to muffle words and euphemize.
Journalism tells stories how they
are.
The day after I sat in Bruegger's
with all the former editors of The
Tower who are now students at
Michigan. We ate a lot of bagels
as part of The Tower staff, and
probably single-handedly could've
kept our hometown Bruegger's in
business. On this day we ate a lot
of bagels too, because when you
couldn't come up with the words to
speak, stuffing your mouth with a
bagel was the onlyviable alternative.
Jeff would always say, "The best
way to kids' hearts is through their
stomachs," words that continued to
ring true.
After graduating high school, I
forgot to take writing with me. Ihad
traded words on a page for strings
in C++, editingstories for debugging
programs and page design for
formatting technical reports for my
engineering classes. Before I left
home I told Jeff I'd probably join
the paper here. Two years later,
though he wouldn't be able to see it,
I finally delivered on those words,
and walked into the newsroom of
The Michigan Daily.
I still print out and edit all my
writing like Jeff did. Sometimes
it has the entire first paragraph
circled with remarks like, "This
lead sucks," partly out of humor
and partly because such. bluntness
taughtme to expect perfection
myself. Other times it's light on the
red pen comments with a simple
"Good job" at the end.
Jeff may never have had the
chance to read anything I write
here, but a bit of him lives on in each
word here. And for that no words
could suffice.

The RhythM of community

When we first arrive on campus,
we are viewed as a blank slate to
this University. We are a horde
of bright-eyed, well-rested freshmen, with
numerous pathways laid before us, providing
us with what we can and will
become. At the University,
we excel in academics and
in athletics, but a large ,
component of what makes
our student body unique
is our extracurricular
activities. The dance
groups on campus range
from beginner to expert SARA
and cross a huge breadth SHIAMASKIN
of styles, and I was able to
talk with Meredith Njus,
the co-director of RhythM Tap Ensemble.
A senior and neuroscience major, Meredith
joined RhythM her freshman year, and has
since risen to an executive position.
RhythM, established in 2000, was a group
for girls with tap dancing experience. Though
the dance community was smaller back
then, RhythM quickly rose to become "an
elite tap group," according to Njus. With the
skill set high, RhythM opened for business,
accepting girls and encouraging them to keep
dancing throughout college. The 15-person
group wanted to show the dance community
that tap could become, yet again, a popular
performance medium. Meredith told me
that tap is considered the truest American
dance form, made popular by the likes of
Fred Astaire in the 1920s. Now, RhythM
puts the traditional steps and movements to
popular tunes. "We use modern music, like
hip hop tracks, because people on campus and
audiences really respond to that a lot better
than if we use something random or offbeat,"
Njus said. Combining the old with the new
helps to grab attention, for those that see
RhythM as a saucy bunch of talented women
or as a dance group with unmatched skill.
Upon first arriving to Michigan, we are
bombarded with messages to find ourselves
and to do what makes us happy. We each want
to find a group that allows us to have great
friends, to grow within the group and to have
a lasting impact on our campus and within

ourselves. Several studies have shown that
being involved in a group on a campus, be ita
large or small school, provides many benefits
to students, both socially and academically.
In the paper "College and its Effects on
Students" presented in the Encyclopedia of
Education in 2003, several authors addressed
the link between a student's extracurricular
participation and their overall success in
school.One ofthe nine generalizations that the
authors Feldman and Newcomb said impacted
students was: "... the more incongruent a
student is with the overall environment
of his [sic] college the more likely he is to
withdraw from that college ..." By finding
something that closely fits the personality
of a student, a student will obviously want
to stay involved. Leaving college is no easy
task, but tearing away from a student group
within which you have immersed yourself is
even more difficult. Other authors show that
there is a positive association between having
relations with student peer groups, faculty
and academics and a student's learning,
educational performance and even social
self-concepts. The difficulty of feeling as if
you are one of several thousands of people is
quickly diminished once you find a group that
can make you feel like a vital team member,
that the group would be incomplete without
you present. The feeling that you matter, that
you can elicit change, make people listen is
a powerful feeling. A feeling that makes you
want to stay at a university and continuecto be a
part ofsomethingthatwill forever remindyou
of college.
But it doesn't need to just be a performance
group. It could be volunteering, juggling,
anime, archeology and so on. To the girls in
RhythM, it is the group in which they became
empowered on this campus. RhythM provides
the University of Michigan with a tap dancing
group that strives to allow the women they
take in to find their sure-footing in a metal-
tipped shoe, and to expand their repertoire
of dances while still feeling like they have the
abilitytobe outstandingin their style of dance
and on the stage.

Remember the non-partisan elections

This midterm election is impor-
tant for our state and the nation,
but it is equally important for our
local community. At the polls many
people will have the opportunity to
'vote the ticket,' casting all votes for
a particular political party. Even if
that is your modus operandi, do not
forget to consider and vote for non-
partisan candidates toward the end
of the ballot as well. Judges in par-
ticular are expected to be impartial,
hence party affiliation is impracti-
cal. This is an important year for
the judiciary in our community.
Justices in the Michigan Supreme
Court and judges in the Washtenaw
Circuit Court are up for election.
At the moment, Washtenaw
County has a very strong judiciary.
It makes sense with Michigan Law
School, a perennial top 10 in the

rankings, only blocks away from the
Washtenaw County Trial Court on
Huron Street. I worked at the court-
house as a judicial intern, and I was
impressed with the importance of
qualified judges. Most people dread
going to court, and it is an intimi-
dating arena for the uninitiated
(read: the 99.5 percent of Americans
who have not passed the bar exam).
The vacant position on the bench
is left by retiring Judge Donald
Shelton, an accomplished local fig-
ure (Judge Shelton served as mayor
of nearby Saline before becoming
Circuit Judge). An excellent candi-
date to replace Judge Shelton would
be Pat Conlin. Pat was raised in
Washtenaw County and has deep
ties to this community. He has been
a practicing attorney in Washtenaw
County for over 15 years and spe-

cializes in family law and dispute
resolution - skills that will trans-
late well if he is elected judge.
A recent poll of attorneys in the
Washtenaw County Bar Association
was taken to measure each Circuit
Court candidate's aptitude. The
WCBA is a key poll because these
advocates will most likely be
representing clients before the
future judge. Pat Conlin was the
highest-ratedcandidateasmeasured
in the categories of Interpersonal
Skills and Character Traits of a
successful judge.
When you head to the voting
booths Nov. 4, take care to vote for
the non-partisan candidates and
keep Washtenaw County's judiciary
strong with a vote for Pat Conlin.
JR Keller is an LSA senior.

Israel closes Jerusalem holy

Tensions increase
after violence
escalates
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
closed all access to Jerusalem's
most sensitive religious site,
on Thursday, a rare move that
ratcheted up already height-
ened tensions following the
attempted assassination of a
prominent Jewish religious
activist and the killing of his
suspected Palestinian assailant
by police.
The Palestinians accused
Israel of a "declaration of war,"
deepening a crisis fueled by
failed.peace efforts, continued
Israeli settlement construc-
tion and months of simmering
violence in the holy city. While
Israel said it would reopen the
site on Friday, the increasingly
religious nature of the unrest
risked igniting further violence.
Both the Israeli and Palestin-
ian leaders blamed each other
for the tensions. Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
accused Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas, who has
called for banning Jews from
the hilltop holy site, of inciting
the violence.
"The international commu-
nity must stop its hypocrisy and
act against the inciters," Netan-

yahu said.
Abbas, meanwhile, said Jeru-
salem is a "red line that must
not be touched." The decision
to close access to the Al Aqsa
Mosque compound was "a dec-
laration of war" that "will lead
to further escalation and insta-
bility," his spokesman, Nabil
Abu Rdeneh, said. Abbas made
no mention of the attempted
killing of the Jewish activist.
East Jerusalem, the section
of the city captured by Israel in
1967 and claimed by the Pales-
tinians, has experienced unrest
since the summer, with Pales-
tinian youths throwing stones
and firebombs at motorists and
clashing frequently with Israeli
police. The violence gained
steam last week, when a Pales-
tinian motorist rammed his car
into a crowded train station,
killing a 3-month-old Israeli-
American baby girl.
Much of the unrest has cen-
tered on the holy site, revered
by Jews as the Temple Mount
and Muslims as the Noble Sanc-
tuary. The violence reached a
new high late Wednesday when
a gunman on a motorcycle shot
and seriously wounded Yehuda
Glick, a U.S.-born activist who
often leads groups of Jews on
visits to the site.
Glick is a leading voice in
efforts to allow Jews to pray on
the mosque compound - some-

thing that Israeli authorities
ban because they fear it would
prompt violence. Muslim wor-
shippers view Jewish prayer
there as a provocation, fearing
that Jewish extremists are plot-
ting to take over the area.
In an interview this week
with The Associated Press,
Glick warned of the growing
violence in Jerusalem and said
Jews were increasingly being
attacked by Muslims.
"The more extreme Islamist
organizations are taking over
and if we don't stop them early
enough, they will take over
the entire Jerusalem," he said.
"We're calling upon the Israeli
government: Stop the violence."
He remained hospitalized
Thursday in serious condition.
In Washington, State
Department spokeswoman
Jen Psaki condemned the
shooting and said the U.S.
was "extremely concerned by
escalating tensions" in Jerusa-
lem. "It is critical that all sides
exercise restraint, refrain
from provocative actions and
rhetoric, and preserve the sta-
tus quo," she said, adding the
U.S. had been in touch with
Israeli, Palestinian and Jor-
danian officials to calm the
situation. Under a longstand-
ing arrangement, Jordan holds
custodial authority over the
mosque compound.

Heavy monsoon
rains leads to 200
person death toll
KOSLANDA, Sri Lanka
(AP) - Hundreds of desperate
Sri Lankan villagers dug with
" bare hands through the broken
red earth of a deadly landslide
Thursday, defying police orders
after a top disaster official said
there was no chance of finding
more survivors at the high-ele-
vation tea plantation.
There were conflicting
reports of how many people
were missing in the slide, which
struck Wednesday morning in
the island nation's central hills
after heavy monsoon rains.
Disaster Management Min-
ister Mahinda Amaraweera
said the number of dead at the
Koslanda tea plantation would
be fewer than 100. But Sri
Lanka's Disaster Management
Center - which Amaraweera
oversees - reported 190 people
missing.
Villagers, meanwhile, said the
death toll could easily exceed
200.
"I have visited the scene and
from whlati saw I don't think:
there wi be any survivors,"
Amaraweera told The Associat-
ed Press on Thursday. "But that
number is less than 100."
Frustrated relatives who had
watched the search from the
sidelines tried to follow a politi-
cian into the search site but were
stopped by police. However, the
politician argued with police
and took villagers with him
who joined hundreds of soldiers
searching through the mud for
survivors.
The search was suspended

on our own endowment to pay
for the University's operations
because the state appropriation
keeps decreasing, it is even more
important that we are great stew-
ards of that endowment," White
said.
White estimated the total cost
of attendance for each student at
the University is $55,000, or the
cost of an out-of-state student's
" tuition. The difference between
in-state and out-of-state tuition
is supposed to be the state appro-
priation, but because this has
decreased there becomes a great-
er challenge for the University,
White said.
"We are well aware that you
can't charge what it costs to every-
body because they can't afford it,"
White said. "We want to have the
best students regardless of their
socioeconomic circumstances so
we have to come up with ways to
make up that gap."
One of the key sources of
providing funding will be the
Victors for Michigan $4 billion
fundraising campaign - $1 bil-
lion of which will be earmarked
for financial aid. White said
this effort aims to provide the
University financial aid sustain-
ability over coming generations,
White said.
While this is White's third

time running, she said she has
4 found continued enthusiasm for
the job, particularly with the
new leadership of University
President Mark Schlissel.
"Schlissel is tireless and he is
engaged," White said. "I really
want to help him be successful."

Thursday evening because of
heavy rain.
President Mahinda Rajapak-
sa visited the disaster site on
Thursday and spoke to residents
who are takingshelter in schools
and temples. According to his
website, Rajapaksa ordered
officials to expedite rescue and
relief for the victims.
Television reports showed
Rajapaksa inspecting the disas-
ter from the air and meeting
with relief officials. Later he
was seen distributing sleeping
mats and boxes with essential
items to the displaced people
and consoling weeping men and
women.
Amaraweera said the
government had asked the
National Child Protection
Authority to take charge of chil-
dren orphaned by the disaster.
Many children had left for
school before the slide and
returned to see their homes
buried with their parents. A
government minister told Par-
liament thatthey have found 75
orphaned children.
"The government will be fully
responsible for them, we will not
give them to anyone other than
somebody from immediate fam-
ily because they can be sent for
child labor," he said.
A large number of children in
Sri Lanka's tea plantations drop
out of school and work as domes-
tic helpers or waiters in tea bou-
tiques. Many times parents send
children to work due to poverty
or alcoholism.
Displaced people spent
their second evening Thursday
crammed inside a dark, cold
school classroom atop a misty
mountain. Government officials
had begun a survey of the dead
and missing and doctors attend-

ed to the sick and wounded.
A 48-year-old truck driver
who gave his name only as Raja
said he lost all five members of
his household - his wife, two
sons, daughter-in-law and his
6-month-old grandchild.
"I left for work early morn-
ing and got a call asking me to
rush back," Raja said, weeping.
"I came back and there was no
trace of my home, everyone was
buried."
A local government officer
familiar with the tea plantation
said he believes 200-250 people
may have been buried, based on
the number of people usually in
the area at the time. There were
many houses, a big Hindu tem-
ple, a playground and two milk
collection centers where farm-
ers brought their milk to sell.
The officer spoke on condi-
tion of anonymity because gov-
ernment rules prevent him from
speakingto the media.
The tea plantation in Badulla
district, about 140 miles (220
kilometers) east of Colombo,
was one of many in the higher
altitudes of Sri Lanka, formerly
called Ceylon, one of the world's
leading tea producers.
Most of Sri Lanka has expe-
rienced heavy rain over the past
few weeks, and the Disaster
Management Center had issued
warnings of mudslides and fall-
ing rocks. The monsoon season
here runs from October through
December.
Vettiyan Yogeswaran, who
lives in part of the tea plantation
not affected by the landslide,
said authorities had warned
people that the area was vul-
nerable to mudslides and they
should move. But he said no
housing alternatives were
offered.

Efforts to enforce Ebola
quarantine stall in Maine

Nurse insists she
is healthy, leaves
home for bike ride
FORT KENT, Maine (AP) -
Insisting she is perfectly healthy,
nurse Kaci Hickox again defied
the state's Ebola quarantine
Thursday by taking a bike ride
with her boyfriend, and Maine
health authorities struggled to
reach a compromise that would
limit her contact with others.
Hickox, 33, stepped out of her
home on the remote northern
edge of Maine for the second
day in a row, practically daring
authorities to make good on their
threat to go to court to have her
confined against her will. On
Wednesday evening, she went
outside for an impromptu news
conference and shook a reporter's
outstretched hand.
By evening, it was unclear
whether the state had gone to
court or whether there had been
any progress toward ending the
standoff that has become the
nation's most closely watched.
clash between personal freedom
and fear of Ebola. The gover-
nor's office and Hickox's lawyers
would not comment.
Hickox, who returned to the
U.S. last week from treating
Ebola victims in West Africa as

a volunteer with Doctors With-
out Borders, has been under
what Maine is calling a voluntary
quarantine at her home in this
town of 4,300 people.
She has rebelled against the
restrictions, saying that her
rights are being violated and that
she is no threat to others because
she has no symptoms. She tested
negative last weekend for Ebola,
though it can take days for the
virus to reach detectable levels.
Her 21-day quarantine - the
incubation period for the Ebola
virus - is scheduled to end on
Nov.10.
Gov. Paul LePage said state
attorneys and Hickox's lawyers
had discussed a scaled-down
quarantine that would have
allowed her to go for walks, runs
and bicycle rides while prevent-
ing her from venturing into pop-
ulated public places or coming
within 3 feet of others.
Around midday, however, LeP-
age said that the hours of negotia-
tions had gone nowhere, and that
he was prepared to use the full
extent of his authority to protect
the public.
"I was ready and willing - and
remain ready and willing - to
reasonably address the needs
of health care workers meeting
guidelines to assure the public.
health is protected," he said.
Hickox stepped into the media
glare when she returned from

Sierra Leone to become subject to
a mandatory quarantine in New
Jersey. After an uproar, she was
released and traveled more than
600 miles to the small town on
the Canadian border where she
lives with her boyfriend.
She said she is following the
federal Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention recommen-
dation of daily monitoring for
fever and other signs of the dis-
ease.
An unmarked state police
cruiser followed Hickox on her
hour-long morning bike ride on
trails near her home, but police
could not take action to detain
her without a court order signed
by ajudge.
"I really hopethat we can work
things out amicably and continue
to negotiate," she said.
Her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur,
met with reporters Thursday
evening to tell them she was stay-
ing inside.
Addressing the bicycle ride,
Wilbur said they purposefully
rode away from town to avoid
coming into contact with peo-
ple. "We're not trying to push
any limits here. We're members
of this community, too, and we
want to make people comfort-
able," he said.
Maine law allows a judge to
confine someone if health offi-
cials demonstrate "a clear and
immediate public health threat."

of affordable housing programs.
He said if he becomes mayor, the
availability of funds and timing
would determine potential proj-
ects for affordable housing.
"What the city can do is it can
make sure that zoning is suitable
for residential usage and itccan par-
ticipate in the market by support-
ing affordability and affordable
housing inthe city," Taylor said.
Kelly said he believes the city
needs more shelters along with
substance abuse programs, as
he said many of the homeless are
substance abusers.
He added that government
creates the problem of afford-
able housing as much asuit solves
it because zoning and building
codes are not primarily based on
the affordability of the housing
market.
"The best way city government
can make housing more afford-
able is to cut taxes," Kelly said.
"The second is to spur growth of
businesses through less restric-
tive zoning, i.e. mixed-use or
commercial overlay zoning, so
that wages rise and people have

more money. The third is to
pursue a density experiment in
downtown and, if possible, else-
where. As more options for living
space become available, we will
see the effects development has
on the market."
Stadium Boulevard
Billboard
Kelly said the University
undoubtedly benefits the city,
largely through the number of
people employed by the Univer-
sity and the University Health
System. However, he also noted
that the University acts indepen-
dently, citing the fact that the
billboard at Stadium Boulevard
violates city ordinance.
"It's really become the situa-
tion where the University throws
the party and the city cleans up
afterwards," Kelly said.
Kelly met with James Kosteva,
the University's director of com-
munity relations, and discussed
the relationship of the city with
the University. Kelly said he
understood that the goals of the
University and the city overlap
and that the University only pur-
chases properties that are useful
to its purposes.

He added that the main lesson
he took away is that communi-
cation between the University
and the city is very important
and can improve. He said if the
University communicated bet-
ter with the public, much of the
animosity towards its decisions
would be solved.
"(Kelly) reinforced the impor-
tance of communication and the
importance of recognizing that
there are some mutual interests
and that being able to communi-
cate and understand each other's
interests would be exceedingly
important," Kosteva said.
Taylor, who has not yet met
University President Mark
Schlissel but has met with other
University officials as a council-
member, said the University and
the city are bound together and
that the two work together well.
He also noted that he has long
wanted the billboard signs at Sta-
dium Boulevard to be removed.
"There is no question that the
University is a tremendous ben-
efit to the city of Ann Arbor. That
is a given," Taylor said. "There
is also no question that the bill-
board on Stadium Boulevard is a
distraction and an intrusion and
of little utility."

Witty ,factual'Pill'

Jonathan Eig tracks
women's rights
history in new book
By KATHLEEN DAVIS
DailyArts Writer
As college students in the
modern era, it's hard to imag-
ine life without oral contra-
ceptives. It's easy to take for
granted the teeny-tiny pill that
nearly 40 percent of female col-
lege students use, according to
the American College Health
Association - a staggering
amount considering the pill
wasn't even developed until the
1960s.
"The Birth of the Pill" chron-
icles the multi-decade effort
to find a sufficient and effec-
tive course of action for an
issue that has existed since the
beginning of time: unwanted
pregnancy. Ripe with the con-
troversies regarding women's
liberation and sexual freedom,
author Jonathan Eig paints a
fascinating look at the science,
drama and controversy behind
one of the most revolutionary
medical advancements of the
20th century.
"The Birth of the Pill" fol-
lows the crusade of four unlike-
ly heroes with, on the surface,
no striking similarities besides
their shared desire to cre-
ate a pill that would provide a
solution to rising rates of pov-
erty and an answer to the ris-
ing feminist movement of the
1960s.
Gregory Pincus, an untam-
able, wild-haired scientist who
was removed from Harvard's
faculty for conducting unap-
proved in-vitro fertilization
experiments, is the central
brainpower of the movement,
with an unwarranted confi-
dence willing to stop at noth-
ing once there was a goal in
mind. Pincus begins research
after being approached by the
aging yet fiery feminist leg-
end Margaret Sanger, with
hopes of creating a contracep-

their partners knowing or hav-
ing control over. Pincus dives

The merits ofV'
opening sequences

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO
Daily Arts Writer
Last week at around 9:59
p.m., I was frantically scroll-
ing through the TV listings try-
ing to remember what channel
Showtime was on, because the
last time I watched TV on an
actual TV was like, a month
ago. Besides making me feel
hopelessly incompetent (I
decidedly do not live up to my
millennial reputation), live TV
always makes me consider the
title sequence (the same cannot
be said for those awful Subway
Halloween costume commer-
cials). In this case, I stumbled
onto Showtime (340?) just in
time to catch "The Affair" 's
pretty, if not cliche, montage of
enigmatic aquatic shots set to
Fiona Apple's "Container."
As streaming continues to
take over a larger share of view-

seems a relic of the old days
when TV was an event you
showed up for instead of expect-
ing it show up to you. Indeed, it
is an artistic conceit to think us

millenials are actually listen-
ing to Regina Spektor's "You've
Got Time" 13 times in two days
while we binge watch "Orange
is the New Black." Listen, Spe-
ktor, we've got time, but not for
title sequences.
The same goes for Angelo
Badalementi's ethereal score
in "Twin Peaks," the kind of
song that makes time unfold
under the tranquil gaze of the
namesake town - until that is,
Cooper wakes up from a dream
and maybe knows who mur-
dered Laura, and suddenly we
don't have the patience to linger
in Twin Peaks' many bucolic
charms.
For what is lost in stream-
ing, live viewing restores to
title sequence, at least if you
are a better planner than I
am and get there in time. The
title sequence has a long cin-
ematic history, first becom-
ing popular in the late '50s by
graphic designers Saul Bass and
Maurice Binder - Bass's title
sequence for "North by North-
west" is often cited as the ear-
liest example, with its striking
use of kinetic typography (mov-
ingtext) and geometric rhythm.
And Binder of course loaded the
iconic gun barrel sequence that
triggers all James Bond films
with "Dr. No" in 1962 (though
his laudable skill for including a
harem's worth of naked lady sil-
houettes without ever tipping
the movies out of PG territory
should not be discounted).
Cinema has continued its
rich relationship with the title
sequence since then, but only in
the turn of the millennium, i.e.
the dawn of Cable Glory, have
TV title sequences inherited
the across-the-board sophis-
tication of their big screen
counterparts. In 1999, a young
network decided they needed
a title sequence to wield some
cinematic heft for their second
original show, "The Sopranos."
Unlike the precursors of the
'90s, which usually recycled
greatest hits type clips and set
them to a big, recognizable song
(think "Friends" and "Will &
Grace"), "The Sopranos" used
original footage and was free
of anachronistic gimmicks like
freeze frames or color manipu-
lation.
It was deceptively simple,
just Tony Soprano driving to
his New Jersey home from New
York while Alabama 3's "Woke
Up This Morning" played. But
there is much beneath the sur-
face: first it literally drives
home the notion that New
Jersey is Tony's turf, not the
concrete sprawl of the show's
predecessors it pays homage to
(just look at "The Godfather"-
esque logo). The camera also
slices Tony into piece-y close-
ups - showing his arm, then
his chin and eyes, etc., which as
the show developed, became a
metaphor for the fragmentation
of Tony's identity.
"The Sopranos" 's title
sequence remained unchanged
through its six season run, only
removing a shot of the twin
towers after 9/11 (which accord-
ing to David Chase, was only to
preserve narrative cohesion).
Other shows, though, rely on a

seasonal tinkering with open-
ing sequence. Take, for exam-
ple, "The Wire," which varies
its clips depending on which
thematic bones it's going to
pick that season. Clips related
to prostitution, the education
system, police force, drug trade
and other various institutions
are tossed in its deck of cards
and shuffled around.
A more modern example
of this is "American Hor-
ror Story," whose creepy title
sequences have become one of
the show's crown jewels. Like
"The Wire" 's "Way Down in
the Hole," "AHS" keeps its own
jolting score season to season
(though for "Freak Show," it
got some carnival tweaking)
but creates a different hodge-
podge of the bizarre and the
surreal that even Luis Buiuel
and Salvador Dali could envy.
At least for viewing experience, '*
"The Wire" and "AHS" types of
sequences build on engagement
- they're an adjoining puzzle
handed to the obsessive fandom
for dissection and scrutiny.
Of course, now, I need to
return to "The Sopranos" 's
sequence (and its ilk), which
serves a distinctly different
purpose. These sequences are
visual epigrams, standalone
notes that suggest theme rather
than narrative. I think of "Six
Feet Under" here, whose som-
ber, sepia-hued shots of death
play against a springy score.
The montage splices together
sacred and profane - a ritualis-
tic shot of pair of hands washing
themselves against a stark black
background fades into a toe-tag
on a corpse under a morgue's
harsh fluorescent light. The
show itself is packed with the
same kind of simultaneous mys-
tification and demystification
of death, with a handful of black
comedy for good measure.
For original streaming, the
consensus choice seems to
be a subpar version of afore-
mentioned epigraphic title
sequence, perhaps because
they understand even the most
sophisticated opening loses its
gloss four back-to-back epi-
sodes in (though the exact num-
ber is highly debated). Indeed,
the title sequence tune out is an
inevitable symptom for every
binge watcher.
Look at "House of Cards,"
for example, whose dull open-
ing montage of Washington
montages belies the show's
addictive mix of smart political
intrigue and sexual politics - or
perhaps Amazon's "Transpar-
ent"'s whose twinkling credits
grow cloying by round two. The
exception to this is Netflix's
under-watched "Lilyhammer"
where spritely bag-piped theme
song and interesting cinema-
tography are a breath of crisp
(Norwegian) air.
Regardless, writing this arti-
cle constitutes the most atten-
tion I've ever spent on this as a
form. While now increasingly
relegated to fast-forward terri-
tory, consider the title sequence
- the best television reveals a
clockwork meticulousness that
orders and drives it, and evalu-
ation of such extends to its oft-
overlooked opening.

'C onstantine' fails

NBC drama features
some of the worst
acting on TV. Ever.
By JAMIE BIRCOLL
Daily Arts Writer
"Constantine" shouldn't be on
network television;it needs a shad-
owy,graphic atmospherethe kind
that Netflix will
provide for the
"Daredevil"
series debuting Constanne
next year. It's
the kind of show Fridaysat
that is fostered 9p.m.
in darkness and NBC
will thus thrive
on darkness;
the occult, demonology, Hell itself
- topics that should be dealt with
certain a seriousness, albeit with
some levity thrown in, the sort of
combination that can make you
squirm in your seat yet dares you
tolook away.
We get this within the first 10
minutes of the pilot - John Con-
stantine, played by Welsh actor
Matt Ryan ("Layer Cake"), volun-
tarily receives electro-shock treat-
ment in an insane asylum. As he
talks with the head psychologist,
his eyes exude pain, confusion,
fear. This "master ofthe dark arts,"
as his business cards read, also
proves to have quite a wit and sar-
castic bite. Slowly but surely, it is

e Matt

revealed Constantine once fought
demons, but has since lost his faith;
he places himself in the asylum so
that he might realize demons are
figments ofhis imagination. None-
theless, the possession of a patient
at the asylum convinces him to get
back in the game and journey to ...
Atlanta, GA.
Oh, Atlanta: home of lousy
sports teams, Waffle House, large
studio tax breaks and certainly
one of the least visually appealing,
least recognizable cities in Amer-
ica. That the show is so quickly
supplanted fromthe grayumbrage
of England to this sunny Southern
locale foreshadows the impending
collapse of narrative compulsion,
which it almost gleefully pro-
vides in the form of actress Lucy
Griffiths ("True Blood") as Liv
Aberdeen. It is no hyperbole when
I say that Griffiths delivers one of
the worst TV performances ever.
Ever.
And suddenly, "Constantine"
isn't so absorbing. It adopts a
mentor-mentee relationship -
one with zero chemistry, between
Constantine and Liv - with Con-
stantine trying to both save Liv
from a demon that has her marked
for damnation and teach her how
to tap into her supernatural power
of seeing souls trapped between
our world and the next. It glosses
over so much exposition, so many
rules of Constantine's world, as
though we are expected to know
of the conflict between angels and


Ryan
demons, of human intervention
with the occult, etc. before the
show begins.
Yeah, it's out there, but not as
out there as the decision to even
cast Aberdeen in the role. Her
acting is so naive, so childlike, so
completely unprofessional that
it threatens to actually derail the
entire episode. Aesthetic choices,
too, are sometimes questionable,
as with the contrived wide-angle
aerial shot of Constantine, arms
outstretched as he shouts to angels
in the skies.
But despite all of these glaring
issues, there is hope for "Constan-
tine." Pilots rarely, if ever, deliver
the full extent of what a show is
to encompass. "Constantine" ben-
efits drastically from a strong cast-
ing choice in Ryan, who balances
inner turmoil with exceptional wit
and comic timing. A final show-
down between Constantine and
a demon that takes a human form
as a sort of dark-Constantine is
actually quite watchable. Couple
the charismatic Ryan with some
impressive visual effects, add the
fact that Griffiths' character has
already been replaced (yes!); these
are the foundations of a quality TV
show. The producers have dem-
onstrated their awareness of the
show's problems and willingness
to fix them;ifshowrunner David S.
Goyer ("Man of Steel") can inject
some of that "The Dark Knight"
attitude, then "Constantine" just
might become somethingspecial.

special Muggle living in a
wizarding world. She's cur-
rently working on a theatri-
cal adaptation of the series
to premiere in London's West
End, and in Warner Bros' epic
PR dump last month it was
revealed that spinoff "Fantas-
tic Beasts and Where to Find
Them" (Rowling's screen-
writing debut) would be
made into a trilogy. All that,
and then the news came last
week that J.K. (Joanne Fuck-
ing Kathleen!) was releasing
a short story on Hallow-
een, with new Harry Potter
secrets to add to the lore.
J.K. hasn't gotten over Harry
Potter, and thank goodness,
because neither have I.
During my two years at
The Michigan Daily I've had
the self-control to avoid pub-
lishing anything related to
HP. But people know: I was
and always have been that
person, the one who read the
whole series 16 times, who
showed up at the movie the-
ater early in the morning and
waited over 12 hours to get
the best seats (and who was
featured on the local news
for those efforts - thanks
WZZM-17!). I'm the girl who
referenced Dumbledore in
her senior quote. Harry Pot-
ter is the reason I love writ-
ing, the reason I connect so
deeply with the characters I
read, the reason I want to live
in London someday. Harry
Potter is also the reason I'm a
feminist.
No, this children's series is
not a strident feminist mani-
festo, nor an unblemished
social commentary. In an
effort to simplify and moral-
ize, Rowling often glossed
over identities, and that can't
be ignored. The few minority
characters are barely expand-
ed upon (Dean is Black and
an artist! Kingsley Shackle-
bolt is a deep-voiced badass!
Padma and Parvati are Indian
... and exist?), and even her
most progressive admission
- that headmaster and deity
Albus Dumbledore is gay -
was made in an interview
long after the series ended.
Furthermore, despite com-
prising over 1 million words,
the series barely passes the
Bechdel test (a feminist
litmus test that basically

requires female characters in
a film to a) Talk to each other
about b) Not boys). Rowling's
social agenda is certainly
disjointed. But throughout
the series she also developed
her female characters beyond
archetypes, allowing them to
be living, breathing, imper-
fect role models for impres-
sionable little nerds like me.
Take Professor McG-
onagall. At first glance,
she comes off as harsh and
shrewish, the overly strict,
asexual teacher archetype.
(Think of Amy Poehler as
Hillary Clinton, the "boner
shrinker.") But throughout
the series McGonagall grows,
proving herself to be both
fearless and caring, opinion-
ated but fair. She is fiercely
protective of her students,
but not as a cookie-baking,
grandmotherly doll. She
showed that women could be
strong without being sexu-
alized, caring but not soft.
In later stories released by
Rowling, we learn that McG-
onagall had had one great
love, a Muggle boy who she
was forced to leave because
by law she couldn't tell him
about magic. While this
melodrama is typical of a
Rowling backstory, it grants
McGonagall even more emo-
tional complexity. Not a
woman scorned or a sad old
maid, but someone who had
to make deep sacrifices to
keep her integrity.
In a completely different
vein, Molly Weasley is arche-
"typically motherly without
ever losing her power or
agency. She could have been
depicted so differently - a
harried stay-at-home mother
of seven, with a tendency
towards shrillness and excel-
lent cooking skills. Molly had
the makings of a one-dimen-
sional, June Cleaver type. But
Jo knew better. Molly took
care of her children, doing
the laundry, making their
lunches, but in the fifth book
she also was the glue holding
together the entire Order of
the Phoenix operation. She
humbly did the work no one
else thought to do; cooking
and cleaning and organizing
- but also was never afraid
to put grown men in their
place and make them help.
In her most badass moment,
Molly jumps in to protect her
daughter when she is duel-
ing Bellatrix Lestrange (an
interesting Rowling female
in her own right), screaming,
"NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU
BITCH." It's a humorous bit
during a particularly tense
fight scene, but shows that
Molly is not a simpering wife
or back-broken mother - she
is a force to be reckoned
with. In an apron.
And of course, Herm-
ione. Rowling has said in
interviews that if she had

seen Emma Watson before
being cast as Hermione, she
wouldn't have picked her.
Hermione wasn't supposed
to be so cute. I could go on
for days about how book
Hermione and movie Herm-
ione deviate, how Rowling
on some level perpetuates
the beauty ideal and how the
filmmakers do so shameless-
ly. But in reality, Hermione
is one of the most positive
female characters in chil-
dren's literature. She is by
now pretty ubiquitous, and
requires little explanation
- whip-smart, unafraid to
speak up, a leader and activ-
ist. She doesn't simper or
submit; her best friends are
boys but she never is a tom-
boy or a "Cool Girl." Out of
these female role models she
changed the least from begin-
ning to end of the series, and
that's a good thing. Herm-
ione is distinctly who she is
at 10 years old, and stands
by that as she matures. She
made it OK for other preco-
cious bookworms to feel good
about themselves, and I will
forever be indebted to Rowl-
ing for that.
This wasn't the investiga-
tive critique I usually strive
to write; the reason I've
avoided writing about Harry
Potter for so long is because
I do recognize my own bias.
I know these representations
are imperfect, and for every
empowering quality these
women possess, we could dig
through the pages and find
an instance in which they
falter in their feminism. But
Rowling's impact is evident
everywhere, most recently in
comments made by the actors
who played her beloved char-
acters.
In September, Emma Wat-
son gave a speech before the
UN about gender inequality
that went viral and received
nearly universal praise. And
just last week Daniel Rad-
cliffe in an interview was
asked about his status as an
unconventional romantic lead
(news to me, since he has
been a personal sex symbol
since sixth grade, but what-
ever). Instead of playing the
question off and moving on,
he directly called out those
(read: everyone) who began
sexualizing Watson at 16. So
it's not just me who found
their feminist awakening
through Harry Potter. We
can only hope that as Rowl-
ing keeps building her world,
she continues to develop such
complex, valuable female role
models. Until then, thanks
Jo. Happy writing.

CBS has a mixed track record
with its comedies. While the
network is never short of top
talent - like
Kat Den-
nings and Beth
Behrs from "2 The Millers
Broke Girls"
and Melissa MOndays at
McCarthy from 8:30 p.m.
"Mike and CBS
Molly" - it has
a tendency to
make shows that lack the sub-
stance and quality humor to
support the casting ofthose fine
actors. "The Millers," which
just returned for its second sea-
son, is no exception, taking a
group of extremely gifted per-
formers and giving them mate-
rial that isn't worth their time
or ours.
"The Millers" follows the
misadventures of Nathan
Miller (Will Arnett, "Arrested
Development") and the strain
his parents' split has brought to
his own life post-divorce. In the
premiere, Nathan is trying to
find another apartment for his

mother, Carol (Emmy Award
Winner Margo Martindale,
"Justified"), so she can finally
move out of his place. Along the
way, they meet apartment man-
ager Kip Finkle (Sean Hayes,
"Sean Saves the World"), who
eventually moves in with her by
the episode's end.
On any other show, that cast
would be a murderer's row: able
to execute fantastic jokes to
the point where side-splitting
laughter would be unavoidable.
Unfortunately, this is not that
show. The ensemble is doing the
best they can with the material,
but the gags are lazy and dull.
Most of the attempts at humor
in the episode are either based
on sex, gay stereotypes or a
man living with his mother
(and really wanting her gone).
"The Millers" doesn't even try
to be intelligent, writing easy
punchlines instead of clever
ones. One of the biggest laughs
of the studio audience came
when Carol made a joke about
her not having sex with her ex-
husband when he made fun of
her for doing arts and crafts. It
was a basic setup line-punch-
line combination that only left

crickets in the room.
"The Millers" isn't helped
by Hayes' addition to the cast
either. He plays his character
as if he's playing to the cheap
seats in Carnegie Hall. He's
loud, broad and, as a result, he's
tough to watch. His character
is gay-and he plays into stereo-
types too. There's a moment
in the episode where Nathan
kisses Kip, and Hayes proceeds
to shout, "Ewwww! Straight
lips, straight lips," while paw-
ing at his mouth. The rest of his
performance doesn't get much
better than that. He's a strong
fit for the series in terms of tone
and style, but that doesn't make
watching him any less painful.
Instead of making an enjoy-
able show, "The Millers" just
makes you feel bad for every-
one involved. Arnett, Beau
Bridges ("Masters of Sex") and
especially Martindale have
proven themselves to be fantas-
tic actors in the past. Unfortu-
nately, the series is not livingup
to their potential. Maybe losing
a huge chunk of its "Big Bang
Theory" lead-in will be enough
to kill it, if only so the actors
can move on to better things.

Focus shifts to last week of prep

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily SportsEditor
Michigan men's basketball
coach John Beilein spent the
summer and most of the fall
growing his team and preparing
* it for the season overall.
r He said it in June at his first
offseason press conference. He
- said it in August, right before
the team left for a 10-day trip
to Italy. And he said it Oct. 16
at Big Ten Media Day, that his
team was simply getting better at
everything.
There were five months,
three months and one month,
respectively until the season
opener from those dates. The
goal was merely to get the young
Wolverines better.
Now there are 10 days until the
exhibition and 15 until the opener,
and the goal is clearer: get ready
to play Wayne State and Hillsdale,
and - down the line - Oregon, No.
2 Arizona and No. 24 Syracuse.
"The intensity has begun to
ramp up, and the attention to
detail, things like that," said
junior guard Spike Albrecht on
Thursday at the team's media
day. "Just making sure that the
guys know how serious this is,
and they've got to pick it up a
 little bit."
As the calendar turns, the goal
shifts from getting stronger and
quicker to installing offensive
and defensive sets.
"We have a list of so many
things to do to still improve that
we haven't even touched that
we could see in our first game,"
Beilein said.
It helps that the first game is an
exhibition, and the next is against
Division II Hillsdale College, and
the next two are home games

in August.
This year's Michigan team
will need players to grow into
roles just as last year's did. But
for now, despite its youth, the
teamhas a core ofupperclassmen
leading the way.
That includes junior guard
Caris LeVert, the Wolverines' top
returning scorer.
"There's guys that if they're

"But you can still get it across.

and his effort every day speak
volumes for who he is. He's
always been that way, but now,
as one of the veteran players, our
guys are watching him."

Another is Albrecht, who
noted that small mistakes such
as traveling while pivoting and
catching the ball with one hand
are startingto be corrected.
The third upperclassman is
the lone senior, forward Max
Bielfeldt, who, despite playing
a limited role over the summer
with a hip injury, is one of the
most experienced players on
the team.
"The sophomores and juniors
on this team, we are the veteran
leaders, which is scary to think
of," Bielfeldt said. "But I'm the
oldest kid on the team, so I have
to go out there, have to hold
people accountable and push
them to the best they can be."
The Wolverines will also rely
on a group of six freshmen, most
prominently, forward Kameron
Chatman. As a big, athletic wing,
the former four-star recruit
appears to be the favorite to step
into Glenn Robinson III's former

role at the '4' position.

won't single people out right
now, but there's a couple of them
right now that are exceptional
at taking the task and applying
it," Beilein said. "Then there are
some other ones that are very
typical. I don't think anybody
has been, 'Oh my goodness, this
isgoing to be atwo- or three-year
project.'"
Beilein said several different
wrinkles are on the table down
the road. With a longer team,
he could afford to play more
zone defense and try to create
turnovers. On offense, he wants
to see Albrecht and junior guard
Derrick Walton shoot more.
But for now, Michigan has
to get ready to play 40 minutes,
twice a week. Once five months
away, the season starts in 10 days.
As sophomore guard Sean
Lonergan said with a smile: "It
went quick."

Wolverines make first trip to Houghton since 1983

By ERIN LENNON
DailySports Writer
Last year, the Michigan hockey
team entered a home series
against Michigan Tech boasting
a 4-1-1 record that included wins
over three opponents in the top 15.
They weren't scoring much,
but the Wolverines were allowing
fewer than two goals per game
and were no stranger to late-
game, dramatic victories.
This month alone, the
15th-ranked Wolverines have
allowed 16 goals in five contests
and have one scored more than
two goals once. At 2-3, Michigan
will need to sweep a road series
against No. 17 Michigan Tech to
edge above .500 for the first time
this season.
And that's going to be a
challenge.
The Huskies enter this
weekend's series without a loss

the road last weekend. In doing
so, Michigan Tech's defense,
in front of goaltender Jamie
Phillips, allowed only one goal in
120 minutes. Phillips boasts a 1.25
goals allowed average.
If the Wolverines want to
walk away with a road sweep of
their own, they'll have to start by
keeping the goals againstdownto
a minimum.
"To go into Ferris and sweep in
Ferris is pretty hard to do," said
senior forward Zach Hyman. "We
know how hard it is to play Ferris
at Ferris, obviously... Goals are
going to be hard to come by, but
that just means we have to play
better defensively."
Added Michigan coach Red
Berenson: "We've got to cut down
on the goals against. That's the
message."
That's not to say the offense is
in a position to remain stagnant.
Last year, with 1:34 remaining

Tech, junior forward Andrew
Copp drove a puck into the
top-left corner to secure the
Wolverines' second overtime
victory of the season.
Copp's score kicked offa stellar
November in which the captain
led the team in scoring with 13
points, including two overtime
goals.
Alongside sophomore JT
Compher - who moved over
to left wing from center before
the season - and freshman
Dexter Dancs, Copp's line has
been overshadowed early by
the second. Though they've had
enough chances, the trio has
combined for just eight points.
Compher and Copp
- Michigan's top two scorers
from last season - are without a
goal. And it appears Berenson is
ready to end the experiment, as
he plans to put Compher back in
his comfort zone at center this

offense.
"You look at JT and Andrew,
they're proven scorers," Hyman
said. "It's just a matter of time
before they get going. I think that
they're doing all the right things."
Michigan is making its first
trip to Houghton, Michigan under
Berenson. The Wolverines haven't
played at Michigan Tech since
November 1983 after meeting last
year at Yost Ice Arena.
That's not to say this Huskies
team is unfamiliar.
Michigan Tech coach Mel
Pearson spent the duration of
his 23-year tenure in Ann Arbor
as an assistant under Berenson,
and while he was charged with
scheduling opponents, he never
slated a road trip to Michigan
Tech.
The Wolverines will also see
a face from their 1998 national
championship run in Huskies
assistant coach Bill Muckalt. In

tallied 226 points - god for
seventh all-time in program
history - and was a first-team
All-American in 1998.
Freshman forward Dexter
Dancs, who played for the Vernon
Vipers of the British Columbia
Hockey League, looks forward
to skating against former BCHL
competition. Michigan Tech lists
10 BCHL products on its roster,
including five freshmen. Dancs
will skate against a familiar face
in forward Alex Gillies, who
is among the team leaders in
scoring, with three points.
"I haven't been (to Michigan
Tech)," Dancs said. "I have a lot of
buddies up there from the BCHL,
so I'm excited to play them."
For the second straight series,
Michigan will be without key
pieces of its lineup, another
challenge as the Wolverines
maneuver through the last of its
nonconference matchups.
Berenson canceled practice

Wednesday because a sizable
portion of his team was "banged
up" or sick at some point during
the week.
Senior forward Andrew Sinelli
(shoulder/groin), freshman
defenseman Niko Porikos (sports
hernia) and junior forward Justin
Selman will not make the trip to
the Upper Peninsula.
The defense will be under
all the more pressure without
Sinelli, who's seen time at both
forward and defense this season,
and Porikos available.
"I think it's going to be a
defensive battle," said freshman
defenseman Zach Werenski. "I'm
confident going into the weekend.
It's going to be a tough building
with their home opener, so it's
going to be a good test for us."

Breakdown: Ground game key vs. Hoosiers

November 1, 2014: Indiana
ghe ffiidgianlaUlj

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
While Michigan football coach
Brady Hoke said Monday his team
isn't focused on making a bowl
game, there's little else for the
Wolverines to aim for. Needing
three more wins to qualify
for a postseason bid, the quest
begins Saturday when Michigan
hosts Indiana in its annual
Homecoming game.
Last year's matchup was a
shootout that Michigan won,
63-47, in which then-redshirt
junior quarterback Devin
Gardner accounted for five
touchdowns and almost 600 yards
of offense. And while this year's
game could be a barnburner, this
time, both teams sport struggling
quarterbacks, so the ground game
should dictate the matchup.
Here's a breakdown of
Michigan's meeting with the
Hoosiers.
Michigan pass offense vs.
Indiana pass defense
Here's the thing: if this is going
to be a shootout like last year, it
begins with the passing offense.
Gardner has had a mostly down
season that includes having not
thrown for over 200 yards in a
game while throwing just six
touchdowns and 10 interceptions.
But the flashes of greatness have
been there and will be needed
Saturday in order for Michigan
(1-3 Big Ten, 3-5 overall) to keep
up with Indiana's high-powered
offense.
Last week against Michigan
State, junior wide receiver Devin
Funchess had several bad drops,
including a pair in the end zone.
Gardner and the passing offense
will need Funchess to show his
big-play ability to move the ball.
On the other side, Indiana's
defense is suspect at best, giving
up 34.9 points per game -105th
in the country. The Hoosier
secondary allows 283 yards per
game and has forced six turnovers
through eight games.
Edge: Michigan
Michigan rush offense vs.

Fifth-year senior quarterback Devin Gardner will need to do some running of his own, beit designed or improvised, if he hopes to spark a stagnant offense.

Indiana rush defense
Since sophomore Derrick
Green was ruled out for the season
in early October, Michigan has
struggled with running the ball.
The Wolverines average 4.4 yards
per rush behind a questionable
offensive line. Sophomore
running back De'Veon Smith and
redshirt junior Justice Hayes
have taken the bulk of Green's
work, and Smith has scored in
three of'his last four games.
Michigan's protection will
need to look out for defensive
tackle Bobby Richardson, who
leads Indiana (0-3, 3-4) with four
sacks on the season. But overall,
the Hoosier defensive front is
hardly daunting, so Smith and
Hayes should be able to make
some plays.
Edge: Michigan
Indiana pass offense vs.
Michigan pass defense

Due to injuries, the Hoosiers
are starting freshman Zander
Diamont, their third quarterback
of the season. Two weeks ago
against Michigan State, Diamont
made his first career start and
threw for 11 yards on 5-of-
15 passing. While he's sure to
improve on that performance,
the young quarterback remains a
question mark.
Michigan's secondary has been
up and down this season. The unit
ranks seventh in the conference
in pass defense, allowing 209.9
yards per game. Freshman
cornerback Jabrill Peppers
remains sidelined by an apparent
leg injury, so a combination of
redshirt junior Blake Countess,
sophomore Jourdan Lewis and
senior Raymon Taylor will man
the secondary.
Edge: Michigan

remaining T-shirts outside
the student gates to Michigan
Stadium on Saturday.
Kaplan says the donor who
purchased the shirts isn't the only
one who has expressed discontent
with Brandon. The goal Saturday
is to prove that the students - the
voice of the University - care
enough to do something about it.
Brandon notices the student
section at home football games.
He knows it has rarely been full
this year.
The students, he said, have
voiced their displeasure through
their behavior, and he's working
to repair that relationship.
But if Saturday's protest is
executed properly, students
will deliver Brandon, Schlissel,
University administrators and a
large TV audience a notice that
the attempt to mend past actions
isn't enough.
And Kaplan said he believes
that message will be hard to
ignore during Saturday's game.
"I have full faith that it's going
to be a very big event," he said.
"It's really spreading incredibly
well. Everyone's excited for
multiple different reasons. It
makes me excited for Saturday."
That it's Homecoming excites
Kaplan even further, because
it means alumni who have felt
alienated by Brandon returning-
for the weekend can join in
"White Out, Dave Out."
If all goes well, Kaplan said,
you'll see a full, energetic student
section Saturday afternoon. But
in addition to supporting the
team, several thousand students
will be equally as critical of the
head of the Athletic Department.
"We don't want to embarrass
the University," Kaplan said.
"We're doing this because we
care about the University; it's not
like we have a vendetta against
it. ... What we're saying is we, as
a student body, we don't believe
that Dave Brandon is the best to
be in this position. Actually, he's
harming."
