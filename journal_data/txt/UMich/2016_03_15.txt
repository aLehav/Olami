General George 
Casey Jr. says 

increase in veteran 
support is necessary

By CALEB CHADWELL

Daily Staff Reporter

At a talk at the Ford School 

Monday, General George Casey 
Jr., former U.S. Army chief of 
staff, said some of the most 
dangerous threats in the world 
today are posed by non-state 
actors such as al-Qaeda and 
ISIS, focusing on the persistent 
existence of world conflict with 
these actors and the subsequent 
mental health impacts war has 

on soldiers and veterans. 

Casey 
began 
his 
Army 

service in 1970, as the senior 
commander of the interantional 
collation created to confract 
forces in Iraq from 2004 to 
2007. He was promoted to chief 
of staff by President George W. 
Bush in 2007 and served in that 
position under President Obama 
until 2011.

“What I want to do is 

give you a soldier’s view of 
the 
international 
security 

environment,” Casey said.

Rather than countries waging 

war against one another as 
was the case with World War 
II or the Vietnam War, Casey 
said 
some 
non-state 
actors 

such as al-Qaeda and ISIS have 
become more dangerous, citing 

a number of recent events. 

Looking back to 9/11, Casey 

pointed to how a non-state 
actor, al-Qaeda, was able to 
inflict catastrophic damage on 
the United States.

“Nineteen terrorists, in an 

hour and 17 minutes, murdered 
2,977 people, inflicted about 
$40 billion of economic damage 
on New York, and when the 
stock market reopened it lost 
$1.4 trillion in value,” he said. 
“That’s a challenge that we need 
to be prepared to deal with.”

Comparing 
the 
current 

ideological 
struggle 
against 

Islamic 
extremism 
to 
the 

struggle against communism 
during the Cold War, Casey 
talked about how conflict is

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Northwestern prof. 
who wrote contested 

student-faculty 

relations essay speaks

By ISOBEL FUTTER 

Daily Staff Reporter 

Stupid 
sex, 
according 
to 

Northwestern Communications 
Prof. Laura Kipnis, is becoming 
more and more regulated on 
college campuses these days.

Kipnis 
posed 
her 
ideas 

about sexual assault, student-
faculty 
relationships 
and 

sexual repression to faculty 
governances from around the 
country on Monday afternoon.

Kipnis 
received 
national 

attention after she published 
an essay in the Chronicle of 
Higher Education. The essay 
questioned the taboo around 
student-faculty 
relationships 

and 
sexual 
assault. 
Two 

graduate students filed a Title 
IX retaliation complaint against 
Kipnis following the article and 

argued that, in it, she misstated 
facts and created a hostile 
environment following protests 
against the article.

“One of the charges they 

leveled against me was that I 
created a hostile environment 
on campus, or perhaps it was 
a chilling effect,” Kipnis said. 
“I wasn’t entirely sure which 
because I never actually got 
the charges in writing. This 
led me to become interested in 
questions I never thought much 
about previously.”

In 
May 
2015, 
after 
an 

extensive investigation, Kipnis 
was cleared of all charges. 
Since the investigation, Kipnis 
has become a figurehead for 
the 
argument 
against 
the 

high ambiguity and lack of 
due process often associated 
with Title IX investigations. 
Title IX is a set of rules that 
protects students from having a 
comprised education due to any 
form of discrimination. In 2011, 
Title IX was updated to include 
discrimination due to sexual 
assault.

Series aims to raise 

awareness about

within the city

For the Daily

Detroit 
Week, 
a 
week 

dedicated to showcasing the 
culture and energy of Detroit, 

kicked off Monday afternoon 
in the Diag, with students 
from The Detroit Partnership 
promoting events happening 
throughout the week.

According 
to 
Public 

Policy 
senior 
Blair 
Sucher, 

the 
celebratory 
week 
aims 

to 
gravitate 
away 
from 

the 
volunteering-based 

relationship the University of 
Michigan currently has with 
Detroit and instead foster a 
relationship in which Detroit is 

viewed in a more positive light.

“When 
the 
University 

interacts with Detroit, it is 
often on the basis of service 
learning,” 
she 
said. 
“It 
is 

important for people to broaden 
their views and to recognize 
that to create a meaningful, 
sustainable partnership with 
the city of Detroit you need to 
see it in other lights.”

According 
to 
Detroit 

Week’s website, The Detroit 
partinership is hosting events 

and workshops every day from 
March 13 to March 18 in an effort 
to promote the rich history and 
life of the city. Events include a 
“Know Your Rights” discussion 
facilitated by the American 
Civil Liberties Union and the 
National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People 
at Weill Hall, a workshop for 
student 
organizations 
who 

are interested in becoming 
involved in Detroit and a trip

‘U’ research shows 
progress in how 

courts communicate 

abortion law info 

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter 

A recent recreation of a 

University study has showed 
that court systems in Michigan 
are 
now 
providing 
more 

accurate 
information 
to 

minors regarding Michigan’s 
reproductive health laws for 
young women seeking to have 
an abortion without parental 
consent, according to a study by

The study, originally done 

by Anna Kirkland, associate 
director of the Institute for 
Research 
on 
Women 
and 

Gender and recreated by the 
Michigan 
Organization 
on 

Adolescent 
Sexual 
Health, 

revealed that since 2010, nearly 
all 83 of Michigan’s counties 
improved on the ways in which 
information about the Parental 
Rights Restoration Act of 1990. 
The original study found almost 
all of the courts were providing 
inacccurate information.

The 
law 
requires 
young 

women seeking an abortion 
to give their own consent and 
the consent of at least one 
parent or guardian to receive 
the procedure. However, if the 
minor opts not to involve their 
parent or guardian, she has 
the right to a judicial bypass 
hearing in which she has to 
prove to a judge she is mature 

and educated on the topic 
enough to have an abortion 
without additional consent.

According 
to 
Kirkland, 

in 
the 
original 
study 
her 

students made phone calls to 
each county’s court using a 
standardized script, asking how 
someone under the age of 18 
could get a judge’s permission 
to have an abortion without 
informing 
their 
parents. 

Kirkland’s students found many 
counties were unprepared to 
provide the proper information 
for 
minors 
seeking 
bypass 

hearings, 
and, 
oftentimes, 

factors 
such 
as 
regional 

difference, demographics and 
county size would affect the 
performance of the county.

“It’s a right that every girl has 

to be able to seek this judicial 
bypass procedure,” Kirkland 
said. “We shouldn’t have court 
employees lying about the law 
or claiming that a law doesn’t 
exist when it does.”

According 
to 
a 
paper 

summarizing the results of the 
study, the students often found 
they 
were 
inappropriately 

referred to other unhelpful 
employees, and were ridiculed 
or verbally abused while asking 
for 
information. 
Kirkland 

said 
employees 
seemed 

uncooperative and uninformed, 
indicating that not only were 
court 
employees 
unable 
to 

provide accurate information, 
but they were also allowing 
their personal political and 
religious beliefs to influence 
their responses.

“We had large numbers of

Michigan will 

host Wright State 
at Crisler Center 
on Wednesday

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

Though 
the 
Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
team 

will miss the Big Dance for 
the third year in a row, the 
Wolverines won’t end their 
season without a chance to 
hang their first banner.

Monday night, Michigan 

earned a spot in the 64-team 
field of the Women’s National 
Invitation Tournament for 
the third year in a row. The 
Wolverines will host Wright 
State on Wednesday night at 
Crisler Center.

With a win, Michigan 

(9-9 Big Ten, 17-13 overall) 
would move onto the second 
round this weekend to face 
the 
winner 
of 
Bucknell 

and Akron, which will be 
decided Thursday. 

The 
2016 
WNIT 
bid 

marks 
the 
Wolverines’ 

seventh straight berth into 
the postseason, a program 
record. Michigan ended the 
regular season by winning 
five of seven games with 
its two losses coming at 
then-No. 6 Maryland and at 
Rutgers.

Detroit resident Piper Carter talks about Foundation, a group supporting women in hip hop, Monday in East Quadrangle 

Business fraternity Phi Chi 

Theta sold puppy chow as part 
of their money-raising efforts on 
Monday to benefit their capstone 
projects for the semester. LSA 
freshman Sydney Watson, a 
member of the organization, said 
the goal was to finish the semester 
with $400. Yesterday was their 
first day fundraising, she said, and 
they had already collected $50.

“Since it’s our first day, we’ve 

just made the puppy chow 
yesterday and raised that money 
after being out here for an hour,” 
she said. “It’s pretty good I think.”

LSA freshman Juhi Katti said 

it was the winter 2016 semester 
pledge class is responsible for 
raising the whole $400, and last 
fall semester’s pledge class used 
the puppy chow fundraiser as 
well.

Watson said she thinks the 

fundraiser will be successful by 
the end of the semester, but also 

snoted they might try developing 
other fundraising tactics.

“We 
might 
have 
to 
do 

something 
else, 
just 
looking 

around to see what other people 
are doing and what’s working 
for them to help us come up with 
different ideas of what we should 
do, but I think it’s pretty feasible,” 
she said.

Another student organization 

tabling at the intersection of 
Mason, Angell, Tisch and Haven 
halls, MEconomics, was also 
fundraising Monday.

To spread the word about 

their 
economics 
conference, 

“Economics in Motion,” the 
orginzation used Taco Bell tacos 
as a fundraiser rather than baked 
goods.

LSA 
freshman 
Adam 

Giacomelli, who came up with 
the idea to use tacos, said it 
was 
incorporated 
into 
their 

fundraising to stand out from 

other organizations.

“I come through here all the 

time, and I’m really mad that 
Taco Bell isn’t in the League 
anymore,” he said. “It just seemed 
like a unique thing that not many 
people do. I always see doughnuts 
or puppy-chow, but I’ve never 
seen Taco Bell.”

Rather than fundraising using 

Mexican cuisine or a baked goods, 
student 
organization 
Timmy 

Global Health, which fundraises 
for 
medical 
supplies 
and 

sustainable health projects in the 
Dominican Republic, advertised 
their first annual benefit dinner at 
their table Monday.

LSA senior Naveen Menon, 

member of Timmy Global Health, 
said this year they decided to 
incorporate 
local 
restaurants 

into the benefit dinnear, which 
differs from how the event was 
organized in the past.

Workshop features 

remarks from 
Detroit-based 

artists 

By SOPHIE SHERRY

Daily Staff Reporter 

Monday evening, a small 

group of students gathered in 
East Quadrangle for a workshop 
focused on the intersection 
of hip-hop and social justice. 
The event, titled “Hip-Hop 
as 
Activism 
Workshop,” 

included 
presentations 
on 

hip-hop culture as well as 
spoken word and breakdancing 
performances.

The workshop was one of the 

first events featured as a part of 
Detroit Week, sponsored by the 
Semester in Detroit program, 
which is dedicated to learning 
and celebrating Detroit culture 
at the University of Michigan.

Piper Carter, founder of The 

Foundation — a nonprofit that 
aims to shift the gender balance 
in the hip-hop field— began 

the workshop by sharing her 
experiences as a female hip-
hop artist growing up in New 
York and Detroit. When Carter 
moved back to Detroit as an 
adult, she said she felt there was 
a lack of safe spaces for female 
hip-hop artists.

“I moved here from New 

York City, where I am a part of 
a lot of women in hip-hop — it 
is just normal, there is a huge 
woman in hip-hop movement 
there,” Carter said. “And when 
I came to Detroit, when I met 
most of the women that really 
love hip-hop, they had so much 
internalized 
misogyny 
and 

oppression.”

Her group, which began as 

an annual event, now works 
to achieve its goal of shifting 
gender paradigms by creating 
spaces that both welcomed and 
demanded respect of women.

“We wanted a space where 

everybody could come and join 
in and feel free,” Carter said.

She noted that spaces which 

draw 
on 
community 
have 

always existed in hip hop, saying 
it was born in the 1970s due to 
community collaboration.

“What the hip-hop space was 

created for was to harness the 
strength of the community,” 
Carter said. “Children began 
gathering in these spaces so 
they can express themselves 
and come together.”

Michael Reyes, a spoken word 

artist from southwest Detroit, 
echoed Carter’s sentiment in 
remarks during the workshop.

“For me, hip-hop is a tool 

that I use in engaging in critical 
thought around issues of social 
justice, so it is one tool in my 
tool box,” he said. “Another 
tool may be door-knocking, 
another tool is organizing in my 
community.”

Reyes mentors young rappers 

and artists in both Detroit and 
Chicago, 
where 
he 
worked 

with artists such as Chance 
the 
Rapper 
and 
Childish 

Gambino. He said he thinks the 
current state of hip-hop is more 
accessible than when he was 
growing up in the ‘90s, amid a 
battle between underground 
and commercial music.

“It’s really interesting for 

me to see where music is now

CSG, renovations to Bursley to 
be discussed at Regents meeting

Board to vote on 
proposal for $4.35 
million dining hall 
improvement plan 

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

At their meeting Thursday, 

which will be held at University 
of 
Michigan-Dearborn’s 

campus, 
the 
University’s 

Board of Regents will discuss 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
topics, 

including Bursley Dining Hall 
renovations, as well as hear 
updates from Central Student 
Government 
updates 
and 

faculty governance requests.

Bursley Improvements

At the meeting, members 

will vote to approve the Joseph 
Aldrich 
and 
Marguerite 

Knowlton 
Bursley 
Hall 

Dining Improvements project. 

Housing resources will fund 
the 
estimated 
$4,350,000 

renovation 
costs, 
and 
the 

construction is expected to be 
completed in fall 2016.

With 
approximately 
1,270 

students living in Bursley, it 
contains the only residential 
dining hall on North Campus. 
However, the current model 
for the hall differs from other 
residential 
dining 
halls 
on 

campus. 
The 
project 
aims 

to 
renovate 
approximately 

4,700 gross square feet of the 
facility to redesign the serving 
area, allowing for five serving 
stations with different options 
to mirror other spaces on 
campus.

The 
last 
dining 
hall 

renovation project on campus 
was in South Quadrangle, which 
re-opened its doors in fall 2014 
after being closed one year for 
construction. The facility was 
the main focus of a $60 million 
project to renovate South Quad 

— it is now the largest dining 
hall on Central Campus.

An 
estimated 
15 
on-site 

construction 
jobs 
will 
be 

created 
by 
the 
Bursley 

Improvements 
project,

Update

In its March report to the 

regents, 
CSG 
will 
request 

additional staff members for 
the 
University’s 
Counseling 

and 
Psychological 
Services 

program. CSG’s report, released 
ahead of the meeting, points 
to other universities’ recent 
initiatives to increase CAPS 
funding, such as Ohio State 
University, which has doubled 
its budget.

The national standard for 

counselor to student ratio is 
1:1,000, according to the CSG 
report, and the report cites that 
an additional 11 staff members 
would have to be hired to reach 

this 
level. 
Acknowledging 

the unattainability of such a 
goal in the immediate future, 
CSG instead is calling for the 
University to create a five-
year plan to work toward this 
benchmark.

The report also expresses 

concern 
over 
increasing 

enrollment numbers, citing 
a potential increase of 500 
students in the 2016 incoming 
class. CSG will suggest that 
such a rise in enrollment 
numbers 
may 
overwhelm 

the 
current 
student 
life 

programs, including SAPAC, 
CAPS, residence halls and 
dining facilities.

To balance the increase 

in students, CSG will also 
emphasize the importance 
of 
expanding 
student-life 

resources as well.

counties that we called where 
(the information) was completely 
wrong, or they denied that the 
law existed,” Kirkland said.

The study found 43 percent 

of all Michigan counties were 
providing litter, incorrect or no 
information about the law in 
2010, demonstrating a surplus of 
unqualified court personnel in 
answering questions regarding 
the bypass procedure.

In an e-mail interview, Taryn 

Gal, 
outreach 
coordinator 

for MOASH, wrote the new 
study found court clerks and 
clerical workers were especially 
unhelpful to teenagers.

“We found that the entire 

process 
was 
not 
youth-

friendly, especially in terms 
of privacy, accessibility and 
court personnel comfort and 
confidence 
with 
information 

they were providing,” she wrote. 
“Because of the work done in the 
original 2010 study, we were able 
to then go further and identify 
additional barriers that minors 
would likely face when looking 
for information.”

MOASH decided to replicate 

the 
initial 
study 
to 
begin 

their Michigan Youth Rights 
project, or MY Rights, funded 
by the National Institute for 
Reproductive Health, Gal said. 
The project focuses on the rights 
of pregnant minors.

While the 2010 study only 

had 46 percent of counties 
considered 
“in 
the 
green,” 

the MOASH replication study 
held 74 percent of counties in 
the green, nearly a 30-percent 
increase in improvement. The 
study found court personnel 
were able to provide better 
information in 2015 in response 
to the same questions asked in 
2010.

“However, once we delved 

further, we learned that many 
would not provide information 
unless the specific question was 
asked,” Gal wrote. “Therefore, 
a minor not knowing what to 
ask would not be provided with 
necessary information and that, 
beyond those specific answers, 
oftentimes read from an info 
sheet, most could not provide 
additional 
information 
or 

support.”

Both 
Gal 
and 
Kirkland 

attributed 
much 
of 
the 

improvements 
in 
availability 

of 
information 
regarding 

reproductive health laws to the 
study conducted in 2010.

“Some court supervisors were 

really angry that their employees 
had been so unprofessional and 
unprepared, and they were very 
embarrassed,” Kirkland said. “It 
uncovered some embarrassing 
problems that they went on to 
fix.”

First-year 
law 
student 

Laura Cohen, co-president of 
the Michigan chapter of Law 
Students 
for 
Reproductive 

Justice, said though she was not 
surprised to learn that court 
systems are giving inaccurate 
information 
to 
minors, 
the 

lack of information and lack of 
education is a legal issue.

“Putting yourself in the shoes 

of someone who is a teenager in 
a very difficult situation who is 
scared, who doesn’t know what 
to do, who doesn’t think they 
can go to their parents, has no 
way to get around this,” Cohen 
said, “and then you call the court 
and they tell you inaccurately 
that there’s nothing to be done, 
you can see how that can lead to 
some unfortunate results.”

Despite 
statewide 

improvement in the recent study, 
Washtenaw 
County’s 
score 

decreased in the 2015 study with 
the lowest rating, contradicting 
the high rating in 2010.

With 21.4 percent of the 

population under the age of 18, 
this indicates Washtenaw is 
still among the less-prepared 
counties when it comes to the 
judicial bypass procedure, and 
demonstrates a need for court 
personnel to be more educated 
and objective on the topic, 
Cohen said. 

Gal 
echoed 
Cohen’s 

statement, and said she hopes 
courts studied in the research 
will use her findings to make 
improvements 
on 
how 
they 

disseminate 
information 

regarding reproductive health 
laws to minors.

“There is still a need for 

further education and awareness 
raising in order for minors to 
be able to fully exercise their 
rights,” Gal wrote. “If minors are 
not given complete and accurate 
information, they do not have 
full access to the judicial bypass 
process. Less subjectivity and 
inconsistency is needed.”

with the aim of strengthening 
shared 
governance. 
The 

Regents’ Bylaws allow for the 
Senate Assembly to establish 
standing 
committees 
that 

serve 
to 
advise 
the 
vice 

presidents of the University 
with 
nominations 
from 

SACUA.

Weineck’s 
letter 
points 

out, however, that some vice 
presidents 
fail 
to 
consult 

with SACUA, resulting in 
variability, 
inefficiency 

and “duplication of effort.” 
She is proposing a plan to

About half the committee 
would be comprised of these

to Bert’s Jazz Club in Detroit.

On Friday from 12 p.m. to 1 

p.m., Addell Austin Anderson 
and Feodies Shipp of the 
University’s 
Detroit 
Center 

will hold a workshop that 
shares the best practices and 
resources 
for 
engagement 

with Detroit’s citizens and 
organizations.

Nursing junior Matt Bozzo, 

an alum of the Semester in 
Detroit 
program, 
echoed 

Sucher’s statements, and said 
his experiences participating 
in 
a 
longer-term 
program 

past a day of volunteering 
helped him look at the city life 

through a new lens.

“My semester in Detroit 

was eye-opening,” he said. 
“I learned a lot about myself 
and the city and its historical 
context. It was very fun, 
experiential learning.”

The University’s Semester 

in Detroit program is one of 
the many entities sponsoring 
Detroit Week. Alana Hoey 
Moore, a staff member of 
Semester in Detroit, stressed 
the importance of recognizing 
Detroit 
as 
more 
than 
a 

struggling city.

“We on the campus really 

buy into this narrative of 
Detroit that it’s devastated 
and blighted, and while the 
city certainly struggles, there 
is so much life happening in 

Detroit,” she said. “(Detroit 
Week) gives students who 
might not normally make a 
whole trip down to Detroit an 
opportunity to engage in the 
city and get a view of some 
things happening there.”

Detroit 
Week 
will 
also 

feature “The SOUP,” which 
aims to capture a sense of 
Detroit 
without 
actually 

making a trip to the city. 
According to their website, 
the 
SOUP’s 
crowd-funding 

intiative 
aims 
to 
promote 

Detroit-based 
funding, 

creativity and collaboration. 
The SOUP will hold a $5 soup 
fundraising dinner held in the 
Trotter Multicultural Center 
on Wednesday night during 
which attendees will listen and 

vote on several presentations 
about Detroit-based projects 
led by individuals affiliated 
with the University.

According to their website, 

the event aims to create long-
lasting relationships between 
Detroit and the University. The 
winning project will receive 
all the money contributed from 
donors at the event.

Hoey 
Moore 
said 
she 

thought many positive things 
that happen in Detroit, such 
as the projects that will be 
featured 
and 
Wednesday’s 

“The SOUP” event, don’t get 
the recognition they deserve.

“There’s so much happening 

in 
Detroit 
that’s 
been 

happening for a long time that 
we largely ignore,” she said.

likely to persist for decades to 
come. He noted that ideological 
conflict tends to last longer, 
pointing to how the Cold War 
lasted about 45 years and noting 
it has been 15 years since the 
United States began fighting 
Islamic extremism after 9/11.

“However, this is not a struggle 

like the Cold War that we can 
win by ourselves, it’s a struggle 
that can only be won within 
Islam,” Casey said. “You see that 
struggle taking place between 
moderate and extremist Islam, 
but by virtue of that fact that it is 
an ideological struggle, it’s going 
to take a long time to resolve.”

Casey 
also 
discussed 
his 

experiences and the challenges 
of his time Iraq. He said while 
the United States needs to stay 
engaged 
in 
the 
ideological 

conflict that is taking place in 
the Middle East, it also needs to 
better understand its military 
power and unite diverse groups 
to lead collaboratively.

“We are the indispensable 

catalyst, we bring unmatched 
economic, military and moral 
power,” Casey said. “We can 
create coalitions to deal with a 
lot of these challenges.”

Casey 
also 
discussed 
the 

treatment 
of 
veterans 
and 

improving soldiers and veterans’ 
mental health.

“We 
cannot 
and 
should 

not expect the government to 
do 
everything 
themselves,” 

Casey said. “I worked for the 
government for 41 years, it is a 
huge inefficient bureaucracy, and 
it will never be able to deal with 
the individual challenges facing 
our veterans and their families as 
well as private efforts can.”

The 
more 
than 
400,000 

organizations around the United 
States that support veterans are 
the ones making a real difference, 
Casey said.

“They send a signal to the men 

and women involved in the armed 
forces that America cares,” Casey 
said. “That is hugely important.”

Speaking on the health of 

current soldiers, Casey said when 
he was preparing to assume his 
position as chief of staff in 2007, 
he reviewed an Army personnel 
survey that found 90 percent 
of 
soldiers 
would 
not 
seek 

treatment for a behavioral health 
issue because they thought that it 
would affect their career.

“We began working to reduce 

the stigma of getting behavioral 
health care,” he said. “After 
banging away at it for my four 
years, we had reduced the 
number who would not get help 
from 90 percent to 50 percent.”

According 
to 
Casey, 
that 

number has now decreased to 
approximately 35 percent since 
he left his position as chief of 
staff, but he reiterated that 
efforts need to continue to reduce 
that further.

Brian 
Garcia, 
a 
Business 

and 
Public 
Policy 
graduate 

student who served as a field 
artillery captain in the Army in 
Afghanistan in 2011 and 2012, 
said it was an honor to hear and 
have the opportunity to interact 
with Casey.

“Hearing 
him 
speak 
was 

awesome,” Garcia said. “I think 
that he and I view a lot of the 
same issues that soldiers face 
and that the U.S. faces on foreign 
policy pretty similarly. He’s an 
incredibly well-spoken and well-
thought-out individual, and I 
hope that his influence is still felt 
in national foreign policy.”

Garcia added that he thought 

the talk helped attendees be more 
informed about military issues. 

“Overall I think it was a very 

enlightening conversation that 
we had, and I think that a lot 
of people are going to walk 
away from this with a greater 
understanding of the nuances 
that the military and U.S. faces 
on foreign policy issues,” Garcia 
said.

“Sex has always been messy, 

which is what is both appealing 
and stressing about it,” Kipnis 
said. “But compounding the 
messiness on campus now is 
the dismal fact that there’s a 
long list of things you’re not 
supposed to say about this 
mess. It’s far more impossible 
to have an intellectually honest 
discussion about sex on campus 
on the American campus than 
off these days.”

Comparative 
Literature 

Prof. 
Silke-Maria 
Weineck, 

chair 
of 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs, said these issues have 
recently been prevalent at the 
University.

“We have spent a lot of 

time debating questions of 
both sexual assault and due 
process at the University over 
the last two years,” Weineck 
said. 
“I 
thought 
(Kipnis’ 

speech) brought together so 
many themes that we’ve been 
discussing on campus and at 

the University as a whole.”

Kipnis 
argued 
that 
the 

recent influx in regulation on 
sex is shifting the connotation 
of sex from fun to dangerous.

“Shifting the stress from 

pleasure to danger not only 
changes 
the 
prevailing 

narrative, but changing the 
narrative changes the way sex 
is experienced,” Kipnis said. 
“We’re social creatures after 
all, and narrative is how we 
make sense of the world.”

She 
also 
joked 
about 

university 
administrators 

who 
try 
to 
criminalize 

sexual activity after alcohol 
consumption.

“Among the new regulations 

administrators have foisted on 
campus is criminalizing sex 
when either party has been 
drinking, so all sex in other 
words,” she said.

Kipnis said she believes 

there are a fair share of cases 
that deserve legal attention, 
particularly when it comes to 
sexual assault between faculty 
and students. However, she 
pointed out that many cases are 
blown out of proportion.

“No doubt a fair number 

of such professors deserve 
to be picked off and some 
accusations 
are 
justified,” 

Kipnis said. “Yes, there are 
people who should lose their 
jobs. But too many of these 
accusations 
are 
overblown, 

hysterical, self-dramatized or 
self-exonerating.”

Colin 
Campbell, 

Pharmacology 
professor 
at 

the University of Minnesota, 
said he attended the event 
after reading her article in the 
Chronicle. 

“I 
was 
looking 
forward 

to meeting her, she’s very 
refreshing,” Campbell said.

He said though students 

shouldn’t 
be 
blamed 
for 

the 
recent 
crackdown 
on 

sexual regulation, they will 
experience dissonance such as 
this in their college careers and 
beyond.

“You came to college to 

get exposed to things that 
you wouldn’t necessarily get 
exposed to,” Campbell said. 
“You don’t know what it’s going 
to be and you’re not going to 
like all of it.”

The event, which was part 

of the Faculty Governance 
Conference 
hosted 
by 

the Faculty Senate at the 
University, 
hosted 
faculty 

governances from Big Ten 
schools: 
the 
University 
of 

Virginia, the University of 
North Carolina, the University 
of California, Los Angeles and 
the University of California, 
Berkeley. 
The 
conference 

features a series of speakers, 
panels and discussions, and 
will be concluding Tuesday 
afternoon.

The event is the first of 

its kind at the University 
of Michigan, and Weineck 
said the conference has been 
fascinating.

“It’s so interesting to see 

how 
different 
the 
faculty 

government structures are at 
other universities,” Weineck 
said. “I think what’s becoming 
increasingly clear to Michigan 
faculty here is that Michigan 
has one of the weakest faculty 
governance systems in the 
country, and that is something 
we would actually like to 
change.”

with young people because now 
all you need is a computer and a 
microphone and you can create 
a really awesome album,” Reyes 
said.

Benito Vasquez, a breakdancer, 

dance instructor and community 
leader 
in 
southwest 
Detroit 

also known as Mav-One, said 
the work that he and the other 
speakers are doing is based on 
the principle “each one teach 
one.”

“We have such a small culture 

as far as actual beat boys and 
beat girls go, anytime you’re out 
there you should be teaching, you 
should be engaging, you should 
be talking to people,” he said.

LSA freshman Jason Young, 

who is participating in Semester 

in Detroit in the fall, said he 
thought Monday evening’s event 
better prepared him to explore 
the city firsthand in September.

“I am just really excited to, one, 

be in Detroit in a few months,” 
he said. “I am then going to be 
able to get a better look at these 
things 
and 
hopefully 
check 

out the actual culture, that is 
hopefully still there.”

Alana Hoey Moore, program 

coordinator 
for 
Semester 
in 

Detroit, said she was very pleased 
with how the event turned out.

“I am just really glad we can 

have an engaging conversation,” 
she said. “I don’t really care 
how many people are present 
as long as those who are there 
are making real connections 
with one another and having 
transformative experiences, so I 
think it was a great kickoff to the 
week.”

to them winning the Big Ten 
Tournament, but those hopes 
disappeared 
when 
Iowa 

handed Michigan a first-round 
loss in Indianapolis — the 
second year in a row that the 
Wolverines were sent packing 
on day one.

Michigan is now in the 

postseason 
with 
another 

opportunity 
to 
win 
a 

championship. Last season, 
the Wolverines made a run 
into the WNIT semifinals 
with 
then-freshman 
guard 

Katelynn 
Flaherty 
leading 

the team in points and former 
forwards Cyesha Goree and 
Nicole Elmblad and former 
guard 
Shannon 
Smith 

collecting 59 percent of the 
team’s boards.

Michigan hosted UCLA at 

Crisler Center last spring and 

nearly pulled off a win to play 
in the championship, but the 
team made a few critical errors 
down the stretch to lose by just 
four points.

This 
year, 
though, 
the 

Wolverines may be in an even 
better position to win the 
WNIT. Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico, the only coach 
in program history to be in 
the postseason in each of her 
first four seasons, is more than 
equipped to take her team all 
the way to the finish.

Barnes Arico helped Team 

USA win the gold medal at 
the FIBA U19 Championship 
in Russia this summer, and 
worked with some of the top 
talent in the country. When she 
got back to the United States, 
she was still working with 
top talent in Flaherty, who is 
averaging 22.6 points a game, 
and freshman center Hallie 
Thome, who is dominating 
under the basket.

Success from the dynamic 

duo of Flaherty and Thome 
will be key for the Wolverines 
to make a run as deep, or 
deeper, as they did last season 
in the WNIT.

As for the fate of Michigan’s 

Big 
Ten 
opponents, 
Iowa, 

Minnesota, 
Nebraska, 

Northwestern 
and 
Rutgers 

made 
the 
WNIT. 
Eastern 

Michigan also earned a spot 
in the field, which brings the 
Wolverines’ 
record 
against 

WNIT teams they’ve faced 
this season to 4-5.

The 
women’s 
NCAA 

Tournament bracket was also 
released Monday night, and 
six of Michigan’s previous 
opponents got in: No. 2 seed 
Maryland, No. 3 seed Ohio 
Sate, No. 4 seed Michigan 
State, No. 9 seed Indiana, 
No. 11 seed Purdue and No. 11 
seed Princeton. Against those 
teams, the Wolverines went 1-7 
in the regular season.

L

ast fall, University of Michi-
gan President Mark Schlissel 
gathered the Greek commu-

nity and excori-
ated them for 
devaluing 
the 

University’s 
academic repu-
tation. This is 
part of a larg-
er pattern on 
our campus of 
beginning 
to 

hold Greek life 
accountable. 
Greek life has 
been the focus 
of changes that address the drinking 
culture and campus sexual assault 
that has gone unchecked for too long. 
Schlissel’s changes that target these 
issues are a welcome change of pace. 
It’s high time that the University no 
longer turns a blind eye, and these 
organizations bear the costs of their 
actions. However, in an effort to curb 
these serious problems with Greek 
life, the administration has swung 
the pendulum too far in an authorita-
tive direction.

While it is important to address 

these issues, the University must 
reevaluate disciplinary actions and 
focus on creating a dialogue. This 
past year, the University threatened 
sanctions on members of Greek 
life who attended the Mud Bowl, a 
charity fundraising event. As Daily 
columnist Brett Graham points out, 
the Mud Bowl exemplifies the best 
aspects of Greek life. The Univer-
sity’s response stepped over the line 
and will likely have long-term nega-
tive consequences.

By simply treating anything Greek-

related with sanctions, the adminis-
tration is developing an adversarial 
relationship with some members of 
the Greek community. This isn’t a 
good course to chart. Personally, I 
have many issues with Greek life, and 
I would love to see fraternities and 
sororities play a diminished role on 
campus. But that’s not a realistic 
possibility. Much of the University’s 
funding comes from wealthy donors 
who were members of Greek life dur-
ing their undergraduate careers, and 
the University won’t likely agree to 
changes that risk losing that money. 

Furthermore, Greek life is a cultural 
institution at the University, with 
more than 20 percent of undergradu-
ate students affiliated. What message 
does the administration send to a sig-
nificant portion of our student body 
when it intervenes in such a paternal-
istic way?

The University’s response mir-

rors a tendency within parts of 
the social activist community on 
campus to demonize Greek life; to 
view it as a toxic mess that doesn’t 
want to improve itself. However, 
it’s important to note that there’s 
will within Greek life to end these 
abuses. I spoke to Henry Adams, 

president of the Interfraternity 
Council, about these issues, and 
from his perspective, there’s a 
growing 
self-awareness 
within 

the IFC of binge drinking and 
sexual assault’s sheer extent. He 
also stressed that he doesn’t view 
the community meeting as a break 
of the IFC’s working relationship 
with the administration and that 
they want to continue improving 
Greek life at the University.

Furthermore, 
Schlissel’s 
com-

munity meeting was co-organized 
by the IFC, and each of the fraterni-
ties’ presidents spoke at the event 
about the meeting’s importance. 
These issues are endemic: members 
of Greek life are 2.5 times more likely 
to be sexually assaulted than non-
members and more likely to binge 
drink than the average student. 
There’s an element within the Greek 
community which earnestly wants to 
curb these issues. These efforts have 

begun to take shape: Fraternities 
serve beer rather than hard liquor at 
open parties and new members are 
given an orientation that aims to pre-
vent the aforementioned behaviors.

Other communities at the Uni-

versity have made similar attempts 
to prevent sexual assault and over-
drinking. My co-op asks our guests 
to define consent before entering a 
party and all of our house officers 
are given bystander intervention 
training by the Inter-Cooperative 
Council. I’ve seen other co-ops 
hang the definition of consent 
around the house. These policies 
show our guests that we have a 
zero-tolerance policy on sexual 
assault. They also make the defi-
nition of consent salient to party-
goers and help prevent potentially 
disastrous encounters. We put in 
a tremendous amount of work to 
prevent sexual assault, but why 
should this be outside the norm?

After Schlissel’s community meet-

ing, Tom Allen, fellow Fordie and 
former president of Alpha Sigma 
Phi, said that “(Greek life) is defi-
nitely going to be open to what was 
said yesterday and in the future work 
really close with the University to 
make things safer.” According to 
Allen, eight fraternities within the 
IFC have already invited SAPAC for 
bystander intervention training and 
we should applaud that. But what 
about the rest?

Students who are in co-ops and are 

part of the University’s social justice 
community should reach out to the 
Greek community. I envision a broad 
partnership between Greek life, 
cooperatives, 
the 
administration, 

CSG, SAPAC and other groups on 
campus dedicated to creating a safer 
campus. This won’t be a cure-all — 
some aspects of toxic masculinity are 
so deeply entrenched that we’ll need 
to see a nationwide cultural shift 
before we can eradicate them. My 
co-op has a deep history of activism, 
but only began aggressively fighting 
against sexual assault in 2014. Let’s 
accelerate that process and instead of 
working in silos, combine our efforts 
to make the University safer.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

A few weeks ago, a bright blue board on the 

Diag sponsored by Students for Life stood next 
to the Shapiro Undergraduate Library advertis-
ing for an initiative called Pregnant on Campus. 
This project’s goal is to provide pregnant or 
parenting students with the support, resources 
and information they need to continue their 
education even while they are dealing with 
the added pressures of pregnancy or raising 
children. Our group holds office hours where 
students can come talk to their peers in a safe, 
non-judgmental environment, and we gather 
resources, references and information so that 
pregnant or parenting students can find what 
they need without spending hours searching 
the Internet. This year, we have even estab-
lished a Pregnant on Campus scholarship. But 
our efforts are tainted by the misconceptions 
and controversies that are attached to our pro-
life label. We see this all the time, and our Diag 
board was no exception — if you looked closely, 
you could see someone’s black Sharpie addition: 
“Abortions are OK too.”

The vandalism in and of itself was not par-

ticularly upsetting to me, despite the hours 
of our time and the investment of our club’s 
money that went into the advertisement. Even 
the message itself was understandable, because 
abortion does remain a legal and viable choice 
for a pregnant student. What bothered me the 
most was that the graffiti artist’s work implied 
that Pregnant on Campus is an effort by Stu-
dents for Life to manipulate and shame women 
into not choosing abortion. This is an assump-
tion that underlies many conversations that I 
have had with pro-choice and even some pro-
life people, and I think it is important to clarify 
our true intentions.

My question is this: If a woman wants to 

carry her child to term, and the biggest barrier 
is her fear that she will not be able to finish her 
education and pursue her goals because of soci-
etal pressures and factors out of her control, 
is abortion a “good enough” solution for her? 
Is it acceptable to encourage her to make that 
choice, instead of demanding that change be 
made on a societal level to ensure that she will 
still be supported and empowered throughout 
her pregnancy and beyond?

This is not to say this is the only situation 

in which a woman would consider abortion, 
and I do not by any means wish to imply that 
a woman makes the decision to abort lightly. 
But the issue of finishing her education is some-
thing every pregnant college student will think 
about, and it is not fair to her that she might 
feel forced into abortion because of a lack of 
support and resources. To me, empowering a 
woman’s right to choose does not mean pushing 

her toward abortion solely because society has 
failed to provide for her and her child. It means 
that if she is even considering making the brave 
and sometimes terrifying decision to parent 
or to give her child to an adoptive family, she 
knows she will be supported and encouraged 
every step of the way.

One of the long-term goals of Pregnant on 

Campus is to make the University of Michigan 
a place that both acknowledges and respects 
the rights that pregnant women are granted 
by Title IX, which forbids universities from 
discriminating on the basis of sex. Since preg-
nancy is something only a woman can ever 
experience, any structures of society that 
punish her for being pregnant are inherently 
sexist, and Title IX recognizes that to create 
equal opportunities for women, pregnant stu-
dents need to be given special support to stay in 
school. For example, one of the biggest impacts 
of Title IX is that professors cannot penalize a 
student’s grade in any way because of a doctor-
approved, pregnancy-related absence and must 
give the student a reasonable amount of time 
to make up work regardless of the attendance 
policy for any other students.

Policies such as these increase a woman’s 

agency to choose by allowing her to consider 
decisions that might otherwise seem impossible 
to make. As a pro-life group, we are not afraid 
to say this increase in support for pregnant stu-
dents has the potential to reduce the number of 
abortions sought by college-age women. And 
we would celebrate this outcome, because it 
would mean that young women are being given 
what they need to truly make their own deci-
sions, free from restrictions imposed by a lack 
of resources. At the most basic level, Students 
for Life is built on a respect for all human life, 
not just the life of the unborn. That means we 
are dedicated to caring about women, too, and 
protecting their rights and their freedoms.

So the next time you see Pregnant on Cam-

pus’ name on the Diag, try to look past your 
preconceived notions of what it means to be 
pro-life. Try to understand that what Preg-
nant on Campus strives for is something that I 
believe pro-choice groups also seek passionate-
ly — the support and empowerment of women 
in our society. A woman should never have to 
choose between her child and her education, 
and it is up to us to make our University a place 
where she feels strong and supported enough to 
have both.

If you are pregnant or parenting and looking for 
support, please do not hesitate to contact Preg-
nant on Campus at pregnantinfo@umich.edu.

Pregnant on campus

CHLOE ALBERTA | OP-ED

A

s I ran in a pack with my 
best friends and track team-
mates on a bright and sunny 

Florida morning, 
I tried desper-
ately to focus on 
the cadence of 
my footfalls and 
the overwhelming sense of calm-
ness that usually washes over me as 
soon as I step out the door. However, 
I quickly found it impossible to enjoy 
the humorous conversation happen-
ing around me, or even the sound of 
the waves gently lapping the shore-
line, due to the disturbing number 
of middle-aged men who deemed it 
their civic duty to comment on every-
thing — ranging from our activity of 
choice (running) to our bodies. That 
first run in Florida lasted only 30 
minutes, but my friends and I were 
cat-called 14 times.

Standing on a street corner, wait-

ing for the traffic whizzing by to 
come to a halt so that we could cross 
the road, a man leaned out of his 
beaten-up truck and had the audac-
ity to snap a picture of us. In one 
swift motion, he crossed all personal 
boundaries and took with him the 
image of our bodies — not knowing 
anything about who we were. I shud-
der thinking about where the picture 
is now or what it was used for. Essen-
tially, standing there in a T-shirt and 
spandex, completely normal running 
attire for a warm climate, I realized 
that I had never felt more exposed 
and objectified in my life.

Here we were, athletes on a train-

ing run so that we could become bet-
ter at our sport, and we were being 
reduced to mere sexual objects. 
Would it be appropriate to stand 
on the sidelines of a college football 
training camp and yell slurs at the 
boys as they sprinted back and forth 

across the field? Or even more simply, 
at the countless shirtless male run-
ners we saw along our route? No, of 
course not, because at no time in our 
lives have we been taught that these 
activities are sexual or that we have 
the right to invade other people’s 
comfort zones with our words. So 
why is it that, because of an inher-
ently patriarchal society, we are 
expected to deal with men ignoring 
our athletic abilities to instead com-
ment on the size of our chests or the 
curvature of our bodies?

The couple of times one of us 

tried to counter the remarks with 
a certain obscene hand gesture, 
the men either yelled more loudly 
or gave us the same motion right 
back. In their minds, our bodies 
were on display for their gratifica-
tion — and they had every right to 
express their pleasure. How dare 
we take away their right to self-
expression, or put in a more sac-
charine manner, their right to give 
“compliments.”

For the record, compliments are 

defined in the dictionary as remarks 
of “esteem, respect, and affection.” 
There is no way that these strang-
ers have any semblance of respect 
for me when all they see is a sum of 
body parts. They don’t know I could 
like the same kind of music as their 
daughters or that I am a student 
attending a prestigious university.

Furthermore, affection implies 

intimacy. Compliments from close 
friends make me feel warm and con-
fident, while these so-called “compli-
ments” from strangers make me feel 
like I have done something wrong. 
They have not only made me feel 
uncomfortable, but have also genu-
inely terrified me. Once, as I was run-
ning on the shoulder of a fairly busy 
road, a car swerved much too close 

to me, and a teenager leaned out 
and screamed something about an 
explicit sexual act. I flinched in sur-
prise and sprinted onto the sidewalk, 
almost in tears due to my anger and 
frustration. I was only a freshman in 
high school. A man who genuinely 
thinks that he is complimenting ran-
dom girls by shouting at them about 
their assets is disillusioned and stuck 
in a far bygone era. 

What’s even more terrifying, how-

ever, is that I have heard girls say they 
do not mind the jeers because they 
prove that they are “hot” or that they 
find the attention amusing. These 
girls are missing out on the impera-
tive difference between a compli-
ment and a derogatory remark. With 
each “hey, baby,” “how you doin’ girl” 
or the incredibly uncreative “damn,” 
the cat-caller is obtaining gratifi-
cation while the act of cat-calling 
becomes even more socially accepted 
in today’s culture. I have been the 
recipient of this kind of harassment 
in Florida, in my hometown of Grand 
Rapids and even in Europe.

Cat-calling can seem benign, but 

it is just the tip of an insidious ice-
berg. Young girls will grow up con-
fusing these invasive and honestly 
just plain creepy remarks as signs 
of genuine love and affection. They 
will think that they must use their 
bodies to garner male attention. 
They will think that what they were 
wearing warranted the harassment, 
and eventually begin to blame them-
selves. This is the problem with cat-
calling. If a grown man can’t contain 
himself while driving past a group 
of barely-of-age girls in sports bras, 
our society obviously still has a lot of 
growing up to do.

W

hen I first joined Facebook in 2008, 
my posts would typically read 
something like, “Elliott Rains is 

going to school … again!!” 
Nobody ever commented 
on, liked or probably even 
read these updates.

Nearly a decade later, I 

sit at my computer with two 
of my Facebook posts col-
lectively approaching 200 
comments. The times have 
certainly changed.

Each of these posts were 

prompts asking my Face-
book friends to openly 
discuss two of the most 
polarizing figures in recent American politi-
cal history: Donald Trump, who has openly 
supported torture, and Bernie Sanders, a self-
described democratic socialist. Given the gen-
erally hostile nature of this year’s presidential 
primaries, one might assume the contents of 
those 200 comments were equally hostile, agi-
tated and not all that constructive.

Having grown up in a small, rural and mostly 

conservative village and now attending a pub-
lic university in one of the most liberal cities in 
the country, I have collected a diverse group of 
Facebook friends over the years.

Many people might question why I did such 

a silly thing in the first place. Nick Bilton, a 
New York Times writer, called social media 
arguments “Can’t-Win Propositions.” When 
interviewing fellow journalists, Bilton was 
even told, “The rule about engaging is that you 
should never engage.” Some respondents noted 
the format and immediacy of social networks 
cause misunderstandings.

According to Bilton and his interviewees, 

the nature of social media, along with the way 
in which people have grown to use them, has 
created this mentality where it is better to say 
nothing at all than to possibly engage in a con-
troversial dialogue. In other words, the most 
civil and safe social media are not social at all.

However, a recent study by the University 

of Delaware suggests that social media com-

ments and discussions might influence voters’ 
perceptions of candidates. Though the findings 
are limited and relatively new, the idea of politi-
cal discussions among friends and family that 
shift narratives and shape opinions is not all 
that radical.

Knowing a Facebook comment might help 

determine who will be written about in history 
books centuries from now should be enough to 
dismiss the idea of “can’t-win” posts. However, 
there is still much apprehension when it comes 
to commenting on somebody’s meme about 
Bernie Sanders taking kids’ lunch money.

After reading and responding to all 200 

comments, you might be surprised how civil 
and productive the discussions were. As a 
whole, I believe a lot was won in the proposi-
tion of engaging. Many of my ultra-conserva-
tive friends from high school conversed with 
many of my ultra-liberal friends from college 
in a civilized and constructive manner. Though 
I can’t attest to anybody’s personal opinions 
being changed, it was visibly apparent that 
many involved in the discussion got something 
out of the experience. A Sanders supporter 
talked with a Republican about progressive tax 
brackets; a vocal Trump supporter and a Sand-
ers activist discussed their mutual distaste for 
Hillary Clinton’s political history.

None of these constructive conversations 

would have taken place if my friends, fam-
ily and I had embraced the mentality that 
social medias are not suitable environments 
for political discussion. Had we accepted the 
criticisms that the technologies underlying 
social networks like Facebook and Twitter 
breed conflict and hatred, we would have 
lost out on educational and enjoyable social 
interaction. If we willingly accept the narra-
tive that the only types of discussions we can 
have as a society on social media are super-
ficial or silent, we might squander one of the 
most revolutionary social developments in 
human history.

Never before has a technological platform 

enabled 200-plus interactions between so 
many complete strangers, allowing them to 
engage with one another on a globally impact-

ful process — much less on a random 
Wednesday night in March. By col-
lectively shifting the narrative to 
one of mutual respect, understand-
ing and civic engagement, the par-
ticipants in the 200-plus interactions 
were given the motivation to partici-
pate harmoniously. The affordances 
of social media were used not as 
enablers to “can’t-win” hostility but 
to possible democratically influential 

connection.

In both 2008 and this past week, 

it was clear to me that we as citi-
zens — be it students, factory work-
ers or CEOs — shape the future of 
social media. Though its affordanc-
es present us with new opportuni-
ties and experiences, we ultimately 
dictate how those affordances will 
be put to use.

I am all in favor of dog memes, 

sports highlights and birthday wish-
es taking up a portion of our news 
feeds. But, I can’t help but think it 
would be a shame if we didn’t take 
advantage of the opportunity to 
change human history with a politi-
cal Facebook post every now and 
then.

‘Thread of Lies’ takes 
on a taboo discussion

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

Cheong-ji (Kim Hyang-gi, “A 

Werewolf Boy”) was every parent’s 
dream — top of her middle school 
class, kind to 
her financially 
struggling 
single 
mother 

and 
helpful 

around 
the 

house. But one 
day, her family 
returned home 
to find that she 
had committed suicide — with 
no explanation left behind. In 
the aftermath of the tragedy, the 
Korean film “Thread of Lies” fol-
lows Cheong-ji’s older sister Man-
ji (Ko Ah-Sung, “Snowpiercer”) in 
unraveling the interactions with 
classmates and family that lead 
Cheong-ji into unnoticed depres-
sion, and ultimately convinced her 
to end her life. 

At first glance, the film’s por-

trayal of girlhood seems intoxi-
catingly sweet. Airy, light-filled 
cinematography and shrill giggles 
relay a quintessential image of 
youth’s charms, but pressure to 
live up to that image forces girls 
into devastating social warfare. 
The flashback-heavy narrative 
framework allows for an econom-

ical use of screen time, a multi-
character reconciliation of guilt 
and loss and an expose into teen 
girls’ labyrinthine social nexus all 
at once.

Given 
Cheong-ji’s 
reserved 

nature, her friendship with Hwa-
yeon, a pretty and popular class-
mate, seems out of place. Man-ji 
finds that their “friendship” was 
a subtly manipulative power 
dynamic in which Hwa-yeon 
demanded gifts and favors from 
Cheong-ji and actively set up situ-
ations to mock her in front of other 
girls. Those other girls, who felt 
they were kinder, still were com-
plicit in ignoring Cheong-ji and 
trapping her in a situation where 
Hwa-yeon was the only friend 
she had. Even her family failed to 
notice times that Cheong-ji tried 
to reach out to them. Early teen-
age years are characterized by a 
pervasive need for group accep-
tance, creating a predicament 
where to ensure self-survival 
means putting another down. 
With naivety and no appropriate 
emotional outlet confounding the 
problem, each girl’s personal inse-
curities quietly fracture Cheong-
Ji’s emotional health, wearing her 
down over time.

As more realizations unfold, 

it’s clear that what originally 
seemed like a blame game turns 

out to be a complex web of guilty 
behavior, some parties actively 
bullying Cheong-ji into emotional 
isolation and some unconsciously 
furthering her depression by not 
recognizing it. So often bullying 
is portrayed as simply explicit 
taunting or physical violence, 
making it difficult to understand 
it when it happens. The success 
of this film comes from probing 
into deeply fleshed out character 
motives, with every act of cruelty 
guided by realistic, common inse-
curities. Subtle yet emotive per-
formances from all cast members 
reveal how personal fear of blame 
and social isolation made it diffi-
cult for the classmates and family 
members to come to terms with 
their involvement.

South Korea has the highest 

suicide rate among Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and 
Development-defined 
developed 

countries, and “Thread of Lies” is 
a nuanced exploration that pen-
etrates the social pressures that 
devastate teenage girls and opens 
up a conversation about how 
symptoms of depression can easily 
go unrecognized.

“Thread of Lies” was screened 

as part of the Korean Cinema Now 
series at the Michigan Theater, pre-
sented by the Nam Center for Kore-
an Studies.

CONCERT REVIEW
Citizen eases nerves 
with blood and punk

By SELENA AGUILERA

Daily Arts Writer

“I just bit my tongue open,” 

was something I heard come out 
of the mouth of a girl with blood 
stained all over her shirt. She 
ran out of the crowd during Citi-
zen’s set to her friends that were 
admiring the band from afar. She 
drank a lot of water, stepped out-
side for a few seconds and delib-
erately immersed herself back 
into the crowd.

Any bystander would have 

been worried, but I didn’t find 
anything too unsettling about 
this situation. This isn’t the first 
time something like that has hap-
pened at a show I’ve attended. In 
fact, it’s one out of tens of situa-
tions. And I think it has every-
thing to do with the type of 
people who attend shows, who 
love live music more than most 
things in this world — the people 
who are willing to sacrifice their 
comforts just to see their favor-
ite band play in the flesh. And I 
don’t think I’ve ever witnessed so 
many sacrificial music lovers in 
one place.

Personally, I am a bundle of 

anxiety, and through my experi-
ence, I have come to find that a 
lot of avid concert attendees are 
bundles 
themselves. 
Walking 

into a venue filled with hundreds 
of people standing shoulder to 
shoulder makes my heart beat out 
of my chest, my breath starts to 
shorten and I regress to my nail 
biting addiction that I thought 
I kicked in tenth grade. I play it 
cool by babbling about irrelevant 
things with friends, but my eyes 
scan the room to find other peo-

ple fidgeting in place spewing 
word vomit too.

So, why would I pay to be this 

anxious? Because once that first 
strum of the guitar hits your ears 
the anxiety disappears.

I was standing among strang-

ers biting my nails as punk rock, 
grunge band, Milk Teeth took 
the stage. Coming from the UK 
with a badass front woman, Milk 
Teeth rocked so hard my hand 
was too busy tapping my leg to 
be subject to nail biting. How-
ever, openers are always a rough 
spot because people are still awk-
wardly standing in place.

After an anxiety-filled set 

change Sorority Noise took the 
stage. During the set front man 
Cameron 
Boucher 
expressed 

his diagnosis of manic depres-
sion and created a peace of mind 
in the crowd by acknowledging 
the reality of mental illnesses. 
The 
Connecticut-based 
band 

opened with “Art School Wan-
nabe” and the anxious skin shed 
off the crowd as they went from 
awkwardly standing to jumping, 
pushing and screaming “Maybe 
I’m my own greatest fear/ Maybe 
I’m too scared to admit that.” 
And when the band played their 
last song the crowd was chant-
ing “Encore!” displaying the evi-
dence that Sorority Noise was an 
absolute crowd pleaser.

The air began filling up with 

word vomit again until Virgin-
ia-based Turnover started to 
play. Turnover created a sensual 
experience with their indie, emo 
kind of vibe and the music com-
manded everyone to sway left 
and right. During their set full 
of songs from their dreamy new 

album, Peripheral Vision, strang-
ers became friends after sing-
ing emotional ballads to each 
other. Vulnerability and comfort 
replaced the anxiety because 
something about live music elim-
inates the fear of judgment.

By the time Citizen came on 

stage, the level of discomfort in 
the venue was almost completely 
stripped from the crowd. Open-
ing with “The Summer” off of 
its debut album, Youth, Citizen’s 
live presence wiped every ounce 
of awkward anxiety out of the 
Crofoot. With no exaggeration, 
almost everyone in the venue, 
besides about three rows of out-
side bystanders, were pushing 
and shoving each other enjoying 
the live music experience at its 
finest. The crowd was a collective 
wave of movement and not only 
did people voluntarily experience 
their mental discomforts to see 
Citizen, they experienced their 
physical discomforts as well.

Neck veins from strenuous 

singing have never been so vis-
ible. The frontman, Mat Ker-
ekes handed the microphone to 
crowd surfers creating a personal 
show while the rest of the band 
slammed on their instruments. 
I’ve never seen a more engaged 
and alive crowd experiencing 
their discomforts for the love of 
music.

So, why do anxiety-ridden 

people sacrifice their mental and 
physical comforts for something? 
Why am I totally OK with that 
guy’s sweat dripping on my shoul-
der? Because being able to see a 
favorite band play live gives me a 
high that makes me feel normal, 
even if it’s just for a little while. 

TV NOTEBOOK
When comedy fails: 
Silverman as Hitler

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

Sarah 
Silverman 
went 
on 

“Conan” as Hitler last Thursday, 
and it wasn’t cool.

The 
long-standing 
question 

of what is or isn’t OK to repre-
sent comically is constantly being 
put to the test. We often take for 
granted the ways in which comedy 
serves as a vehicle for the truth 
— mainly because we’re too busy 
laughing to notice. But it’s impor-
tant to consider the implications of 
this power. With comedy, we can 
say what we normally wouldn’t 
about things we typically wouldn’t 
address.

Sarah Silverman’s appearance 

on “Conan,” dressed as Hitler, is 
an example of the failure to ade-
quately consider the repercussions 
of humorously addressing a tyrant 
and murderer. Though I per-
sonally enjoy Sarah Silverman’s 
comedy and admire her ability to 
brazenly say what’s on her mind, 
her portrayal of Hitler in response 
to the increasing likening of the 
former ruler to GOP presidential 
candidate Donald Trump was an 
instance of poor judgment in taste.

Trump is known for his con-

troversial 
policy 
ideas 
about 

minorities, and more recently, for 
increasingly spitting out hateful 
comments directed at minorities 
in the U.S. Regardless of whether 
he truly believes the things he says 
or if his bigotry is just a ploy to stay 
in the limelight, his statements are 
no laughing matter. And neither is 
the comparison of him to Hitler.

On 
Thursday 
night, 
Sarah 

Silverman went on “Conan” to 
address this comparison as none 
other than Hitler himself. Aside 
from the jarring experience of see-
ing a man responsible for the geno-
cide of millions reincarnated in a 
cartoonish costume on live televi-
sion, Silverman’s humanization of 

Hitler has just as little place in the 
media as do Trump’s discrimina-
tory statements. 

You might think to yourself, “It’s 

only a joke,” or, “It’s OK because 
she’s Jewish.” Well, it’s not just a 
joke. As Charles Churchill wrote, 
“A joke is a very serious thing.” 
Jokes give us the power to criticize 
our society, because they knock 
our guard down and expose us to 
truths we don’t want to face before 
we can put our guards back up 
again. Silverman, dressed as Hit-
ler, exposes “Conan” ’s audience to 
a truth that is both unintended and 
unfounded — that manipulating 
Hitler’s ideology to make light of 
both his and Trump’s beliefs is OK. 

Though pretending that even 

Hitler would denounce Donald 
Trump drives home the point that 
he has some problematic views (to 
say the least), it has a very power-
ful, unintended side effect: it paints 
Hitler in a light that ignores the 
nature of his beliefs and actions. In 
essence, Silverman is making the 
case that Trump is someone who’s 
worse than Adolf Hitler — whose 
Nazi regime oversaw the brutal 
persecution and ultimate extermi-
nation of six million Jews, as well 
as millions of other victims.

Silverman walks on stage greet-

ing the audience with a casual 
“Heil,” then proceeds to speak in 
her own voice as Hitler, saying, “I 
agree with a lot of what he says — 
a lot. Like 90 percent of what he 
says, I’m like, this guy gets it.” Sil-
verman acts like herself, reciting 
Nazi ideology in a manner more 
in line with her own than Hitler’s, 
making her statements all the 
more unsettling. Silverman (AKA 
Hitler) then proceeds to take 
issue with Trumps “crass” way of 
speaking. Yeah, because Trump’s 
delivery of the hateful garbage is 
the problem.

Her intention, of course, is 

not to promote Trump’s or Hit-

ler’s ideas, nor is it to offend the 
generations of people actually 
victimized by the man she por-
trays. But her casual delivery of 
the racist attitude that effectively 
led to the deaths of millions trivi-
alizes the image of Hitler and 
events that took place under his 
rule. Since the beginning of the 
difficult healing process follow-
ing these events, much debate 
has surrounded their appropri-
ate representation in the media. 
Though many years have passed, 
no amount of time can buffer the 
difficult sentiments associated 
with evoking images of the Holo-
caust. And it will especially never, 
ever be funny — no matter what 
the intentions are in satirizing it. 

Comedy isn’t only great, it’s 

also an essential part of discourse 
in our society. But as with most 
things, it has a place and time. 
And making Hitler, the most hated 
man in our world’s history, funny, 
has neither a place nor a time — 
especially not on Conan O’Brien’s 
couch and not during his show. 
Silverman’s performance, though 
intended as a wake-up call to the 
kind of person that’s in the run-
ning for leading our country, sim-
ply makes fun of something that 
isn’t and shouldn’t be funny.

When you have a voice as pow-

erful and established as Silver-
man’s, it becomes necessary that 
it be used judiciously. I’m not try-
ing to attack Sarah Silverman or 
chide people for what they think 
is or isn’t funny. But this instance 
of misguided humor serves to 
remind us of the delicate balance 
between making fun of some-
thing and trivializing it. While it 
is important to remember the con-
sequences of what Hitler did, his 
image and memory should stay in 
the past, where they belong. And it 
is our duty to remember that when 
it comes to humor, there are some 
things that are out of bounds.

Ubu Film

Royal Oak hosts 
two great comics

Shlesinger and 

Johnson combine for 
a hilarious weekend

By CHRISTIAN KENNEDY

Online Arts Editor

Friday: Iliza Shlesinger at 

Mark Ridley’s Comedy Castle

About a month before Iliza 

Shlesinger was set to record her 
third hour-long TV special, she 
took the Comedy Castle’s stage 
in ill-fitting jeans (which were 
appropriately incorporated into 
jokes throughout the set) and 
a yellow t-shirt with an orange 
outline of Michigan.

Opening with a lively and per-

sonal set about the mitten state, 
Shlesinger set the tone for her 
animated, aggressive and always 
witty live show: comparing a 
class of children raising their 
mittens to show where they’re 
from to Hitler’s salute and mak-
ing it clear to the crowd that no 
one besides Michiganders know 
about the Upper Peninsula. “I 
thought this was a cloud,” she 
said pointing the the U.P. on her 
shirt.

The #PartyGoblin segment 

from “Freezing Hot” returned 
in her new material with a kill-
er expansion into the hangover 
stage, waking up with cush-
ion scars and how party gob-

lins strike when they hear, “I’m 
only have one drink.” The “Last 
Comic Standing” winner also 
found continued strength in her 
male / female dynamic commen-
tary. She took the crowd through 
a recent break-up, as well as 
mulling over the absurdity of 
women being able to give birth 
with just “grit,” yet on any other 
day she can’t do 20 push-ups.

Of the show’s highlights, 

Shlesinger’s 
uncanny 
ability 

to convey what she refers to as 
“white girl crazy” was in full 
effect as she narrated the time 
she dumped out an entire purse 
on a dancefloor looking for a lip 
liner, ignoring the fact that she 
wasn’t currently wearing any, 
and eventually terrifying the 
bouncer out of her face.

Shlesinger was loud, she was 

brash, she was honest; and as 
per usual, her comedic timing 
and ability to deliver a punchline 
were as strong as ever.

Saturday: Anjelah Johnson @ 

The Royal Oak Music Theater

Anjelah Johnson gave fans the 

show they wanted — she did her 
staple nail salon joke, kept “Not 
Fancy” ’s “I would be a bad police 
officer” bit, offered up some Bon 
Qui Qui “ghetto fabulousness” 
and brought in plenty of fresh 
material.

The show started with Bon 

Qui Qui coming over the speaker 
system to let everyone know all 

the rules. Then, after an opening 
set from Rahn Hortman, John-
son took the stage to raucous 
cheers from the the theater.

Similar to Shlesinger, John-

son also opened the show with 
a Michigan-centric bit. Starting 
with some obligatory weather 
commentary, the show really 
got started as she detailed her 
time thus far in Detroit / Royal 
Oak. The expectation of cross-
ing from Detroit to Royal Oak 
and seeing a stark change in 
scenery is far from reality, she 
said. “Yeah, you classy, Royal 
Oak,” she teased as she told 
the crowd about a man she saw 
walking down the street with a 
pair of socks in his mouth by a 
local BBQ restaurant.

Newer material included an 

hilarious bit on impulse-buying 
a first home with her husband. 
Between 
her 
not-so-handy 

husband, her mom-less, land-
lord-less reality and a possible 
intruder, Johnson finds some 
of her strongest material in her 
new set.

Acknowledging that she’s get-

ting older, yet is still a “full-grown 
child,” Johnson stuck to some of 
her earliest material and come-
dically piled her newest, boldest 
material on top. Saturday’s per-
formance showcased Johnson’s 
talent, past, present and future, all 
of which is extremely bright — and 
more importantly, hilarious.

Miike Snow create 
more odd indie pop

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Listening to Swedish indie-

pop trio Miike Snow is like a 
box of chocolates: you never 
know 
what 

you’re gonna 
get. In 2009, 
the 
band 

released a fun, 
albeit imper-
fect, 
first 

record, filled 
with 
indie 

gems 
like 

“Animal” and dance-oriented 

jams like “Silvia.” Their experi-
mental sound as a whole came 
from various pop influences, 
such as synthpop (The Postal 
Service), EDM (Swedish House 
Mafia) and electronica (The 
Chemical 
Brothers). 
In 
the 

years following their self-titled 
debut, the group relished in 
unexpected 
popularity, 
gar-

nering recognition from both 
indie and mainstream listen-
ers and playing at big festivals 
like Coachella. However, after 
a lukewarm reception of their 
2012 sophomore record Happy 
to You, Miike Snow’s spontane-
ous 15 minutes of fame quietly 
subsided. This year, however, 
the group has returned to the 
music scene with their appro-
priately titled third record iii. 
Though they’ve been gone for a 
few years now, Snow’s iii marks 
their resurgence into pop music 
in 2016, even if it doesn’t break 
any new ground in their discog-
raphy.

When you have a group of 

producers at the helm of a 
music project like Miike Snow, 
the style frequently takes pre-
cedence over the substance. 
Take, for example, the album’s 
opener, “My Trigger,” a jovial, 
peppy number that struggles 
to make any sense lyrically (it 
contains the line, “I saw you 
licking a dollar bill / I’m in the 
graveyard if looks could kill”). 
The next track “The Heart of 
Me” is in touch with modern 
pop, imbuing some Passion Pit 
and Mylo Xyloto-era Coldplay 
flair to its bubbly rhythm. Yet 
like most of Miike Snow’s work, 

it lacks a compelling story and 
lyrical coherence. Additionally, 
iii’s two lead singles, “Geng-
his Khan” and “Heart is Full,” 
are the album’s most divi-
sive tracks. The former has a 
groovy, finger-snapping beat, 
but its questionable chorus (“I 
get a little bit Genghis Khan 
/ Don’t want you to get it on 
with nobody else but me”) and 
the fact that the song is named 
after an infamous Mongolian 
emperor doesn’t bode well with 
its catchiness. The latter boasts 
a hip-hop heavy instrumental, 
but its superior remix with rap 
duo Run the Jewels, listed as 
a bonus track on iii, makes for 
a much better listen than the 
sluggish original. 

This is not to say, however, 

that Snow doesn’t excel at bring-
ing forth infectious jingles. The 
Charli XCX-assisted “For U” is an 
exercise in glittery, hyperactive 
electro-pop, with Snow produc-
ers Bloodshy & Avant transform-
ing the densely filtered song 
into a jittery banger. The dark “I 
Feel the Weight” contains some 
of Snow’s most mature mate-
rial to date; lead singer Andrew 
Wyatt lends a vulnerable vocod-
ed warble to complement the 
song’s theme of self-loathing and 
detachment from a relationship. 
The opening piano notes of “Back 
of the Car” mimic a Regina Spe-
ktor melody, but the song gradu-
ally grows with Wyatt’s fluttery 
falsetto, some funky 808s and 
even a violin and electric guitar 
breakdown; it’s easily the stron-
gest and most listenable track on 
the album.

However, the problem with 

iii is that even though Miike 
Snow offers their own dis-
tinctive technique, the record 
can’t help but feel as though it’s 
derivative of other pop records. 
Snow doesn’t really need to 
really write great songs — they 
are primarily producers, after 
all. But considering that iii 
sticks comfortably with Snow’s 
unconventional 
flourishes, 

there’s still room for growth.

FILM REVIEW
Powerful ‘Beast’

Japanese film may 

challenge your 

stereotypes of anime

By ANA LUCENA

Daily Arts Writer

Even with its kid-friendly 

anime conventions,“The Boy and 
the Beast” has fantastic charac-
ters that make 
the fantastical 
worlds they live 
in feel real. The 
film might sur-
prise some with 
preconcieved 
notions 
about 

anime. Case in 
point: when I 
told my mom 
I was going to 
watch an anime 
movie, she expressed shock that 
a theater would show two hours’ 
worth of “that weird Japanese 
cartoon thing you watch on You-
Tube.” But there is anime that 
rises above the skepticism, and 
“The Boy and the Beast” is a good 
example of why.

The Beast Kingdom is inhab-

ited by anthropomorphized ani-
mals, as the name suggests. In 
it, the difficult and lazy beast 
Kumatetsu 
(Koji 
Yakusho, 

“Shall We Dance?”) is compet-
ing against the orderly Iôzen 
(Kazuhiro Yamaji, “One-Punch 
Man”) to succeed the kingdom’s 
retiring Lord. On the advice of 
the Lord, Kumatetsu looks for 
a pupil to teach so he can get 
inspired to train harder. The 
Kumatetsu and teacher Iôzen 
are devoted to practicing kendo, 
which harkens back to a sim-

pler time in Asia when martial 
arts masters lived through more 
drama than “Dance Moms.” 
Meanwhile, in the human world, 
young Kyuta (Shota Sometani, 
“Bakuman”) is devastated by 
the sudden death of his divorced 
mother in a car accident. Since 
his father is absent, he must be 
taken in by new legal guardians. 
But he won’t stand for it. The 
driving force of the movie is pre-
sented right away through the 
dialogue, making the plot easy to 
follow. Instead of staying, Kyuta 
runs away in the bustling streets 
of Tokyo full of rage. The anger 
at his mother’s random passing is 
taken seriously, refreshingly vali-
dating the strong emotions of a 
child protagonist. Kyuta encoun-
ters Kumatetsu and follows him 
to the Beast Kingdom, where he 
becomes the beast’s student. The 
leap of faith makes sense after 
seeing the tragedy Kyuta is trying 
to escape. Eventually, he is drawn 
back to the human world and is 
torn as he looks for what his place 
is in both. The close relationship 
that Kyuta and Kumatetsu devel-
op make the emotional conflict 
palpable.

The clear exposition of the 

characters’ lives at the beginning 
of the movie brought their respec-
tive worlds to life. After knowing 
Kyuta’s situation, his reactions to 
the Beast Kingdom felt natural in 
spite of its fictional complexity. 
Their friendship was success-
fully constructed by showing 
how similar their personalities 
are, while still maintaining their 
uniqueness as individuals.

The animation is stunning. 

The landscapes at times looked 
like actual photographs of Tokyo. 
The 
background 
characters’ 

movements were so vivid that 
at first glance, I thought I was 
watching video footage of the 
city. The swooping zoom-ins 
of both worlds were disorient-
ing because I’ve never seen such 
human movement from such wild 
angles.

Just like in real life, the char-

acters are fleshed out with both 
virtues and flaws. There are no 
stereotypical good guys or bad 
guys vying for the viewer’s sym-
pathy (or disdain). This let the 
plot organically grow from its 
characters, which kept the plot 
from feeling predictable.

The film does have a few 

childish points that detracted 
from its authenticity. The fight-
ing sequences between Kuma-
tetsu and Iôzen felt a little like 
TV anime - unnaturally slow, 
with little action. These scenes 
focused on how determined the 
two are on beating each other 
while avoiding the need to actu-
ally show them beating each 
other. The kingdom’s Lord, a 
cute, mustachioed bunny with a 
silly sing-songy voice, was used 
as a fairly cloying comic relief. 
But, taking into consideration 
that “The Boy and the Beast” 
was made for a family audience, 
I think these shortcomings are 
excusable.

This movie follows in the foot-

steps of Studio Ghibli in mak-
ing the universal adventure of a 
young lead character relatable 
to a wide audience. I got excited 
seeing Kyuta come into his own 
in the magical Beast Kingdom, 
remembering the sense of adven-
ture and hope I felt as a little girl 
reading fantasy stories. Age is not 
a factor in enjoying a fun adven-
ture if the story is told well.

‘M’ pitches two shutouts

By TYLER COADY 

Daily Sports Writer

The No. 2 Michigan softball 

team scored one run against 
Illinois 
State 
on 
Saturday. 

Considering 
that 
the 
team 

averages in excess of eight runs 
per game, it was a paltry amount 
for the free-scoring Wolverines.

Michigan (20-2) tallied seven 

hits, but left 10 runners on 
base. Senior centerfielder Sierra 
Lawrence registered another 
multi-hit game, but no other 
Wolverine matched her.

While 
the 
offensive 

performance was lacking, Megan 
Betsa chalked up another story 
in the circle as she recorded her 
finest performance of the season 
to ensure a 1-0 Wolverine win 
over Illinois State (8-17) as she 
gave up only three hits.

“Leaving runners on base is a 

concern,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “But there are 
days when our pitching staff 
picks up our hitting staff.”

Last week, Betsa spoke about 

her frustrations with her recent 
lack of command over the zone, 
as she was struggling to get out 
of innings.

“I was throwing too many 

walks and I was getting behind 
in the count,” Betsa said. “I 
focused in practice on being able 
to get ahead of the hitters.”

Betsa refocused and honed her 

command against the Redbirds, 
as she did not give up a single run 
while racking up 11 strikeouts.

“It really started in practice 

this week as we set up a (strike 
zone net) so I could focus on 
hitting the zone and going 
through my process,” Betsa said.

While Betsa reasserted her 

spot as Michigan’s go-to pitcher, 
the Wolverine hitters put up 
their second-lowest output of 
the season. Lawrence kept up 
her torrid pace at the leadoff 
spot, but the rest of the Michigan 

lineup failed to follow suit. 
Sophomore first baseman Tera 
Blanco and junior left fielder 
Kelly Christner were both held 
hitless, the first time that has 
happened in a game this season. 
Senior second baseman Sierra 
Romero had an unusually quiet 
day, recording only one hit.

Despite the struggles, senior 

right 
fielder 
Kelsey 
Susalla 

provided the timely hitting that 
Michigan needed.

Lawrence singled to start the 

third inning and made her way 
to third base quickly, courtesy 
of Romero reaching first on 
an error. Then, Susalla hit a 
sacrifice fly to center field, giving 
the Wolverines the only run they 
needed on Betsa’s big day.

Next for Michigan was a 

matchup with Dayton (7-10). The 
offensive problems of Saturday 
morning quickly subsided as 
the trio of Lawrence, junior 
shortstop Abby Ramirez and 
Romero put the Wolverines on 

the board in the first inning.

In 
the 
second 
inning, 

Christner reached base with a 
bunt, Sobczak roped a single 
up the middle and senior pinch 
runner Olivia Richvalsky and 
Christner scored.

With a 3-0 lead after two 

innings, Michigan added to it in 
the fourth as the bottom of the 
lineup found its swing. After 
going hitless against Illinois State, 
both sophomore first baseman 
Aidan Falk and freshman infielder 
Faith Canfield notched hits and 
scored, increasing the Wolverine 
lead to five.

Good pitching was not confined 

to just Betsa, however, as Blanco 
also put up her most dominant 
performance of the season.

Struggling 
early 
in 
the 

season 
after 
transitioning 

back to a pitching role from 
predominantly playing first base 
last season, Blanco seemed to put 
it all together against the Flyers. 
Like Betsa, Blanco did not give 

up a single walk and went the 
full seven innings.

Blanco, who is hitting a 

staggering .426, added to the 
lead in the seventh inning as she 
ripped a single into right field 
that made it 6-0.

“It is not that difficult doing 

both 
hitting 
and 
pitching,” 

Blanco said of pulling double 
duty. “At times, I do not get all 
the cuts everyone else gets as I 
have to rush around but it really 
is not too hard.”

With a home game against 

Eastern Michigan on Wednesday, 
Michigan is ready to take the 
field for the first time in Ann 
Arbor this season. It has been a 
long 22-game stretch on the road, 
but indeed a fruitful one that has 
seen the Wolverines cement their 
place at No. 2 in the rankings.

“This season is a long journey 

and it evolves,” Hutchins said. 
“I feel that our team has really 
come together, but (they) need to 
just enjoy themselves.”

BASEBALL

WOMEN’S TENNIS
Wolverines start 
slow at Virginia

Despite wins in 
top two singles 

matches, Michigan 
falls to Cavaliers

By MIKE PERSAK 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan women’s tennis 

team was unable to overcome 
a slow start to its match with 
No. 
10 

Virginia on 
Saturday, 
losing 4-2. 
The sixth-ranked Wolverines’ 
loss was their third of the season 
and their second straight after 
dropping their previous match 
to unranked Texas.

The Wolverines (7-4 overall) 

lost the doubles point as well 
as the No. 3 singles point to fall 
into a 2-0 hole. However, their 
No. 
1 
and 

No. 2 singles 
competitors, 
freshman 
Brienne 
Minor 
and 

senior Ronit 
Yurovsky, 
were 
able 

to even the 
match at two.

That 
was 

all 
of 
the 

momentum 
that 
Michigan 

would be able to attain, though. 
Virginia took the next two 
matches in the No. 5 and No. 
6 singles positions in a pair of 
three set matches, pulling away 
for a 4-2 win.

“I think we got a really 

slow 
start 
from 
doubles,” 

said Michigan coach Ronni 
Bernstein. “But I’m kind of 
proud of the way we hung in 
there and tried to turn that 
match around. We had chances 
there at the end.”

Michigan’s lineup was also 

different than usual. Yurovsky, 
who normally competes in the No. 

1 singles position, was switched 
with 
Minor, 
who 
normally 

competes at No. 2, in order to 
create a more favorable matchup.

“I kinda liked (the matchups). 

I know how those (Virginia) 
kids play.” Bernstein said. “I 
just thought that switching it up 
would work out, and they made 
me look good.”

The Wolverines were also 

without freshman Kate Fahey, 
who suffered an injury on 
Friday, the day before the 
Virginia match. Fahey, who 
is ranked 118th nationally in 
singles 
competition, 
brings 

some stability to the Michigan 
lineup — something the team 
needed desperately on Saturday.

“If we’re healthy, I think that 

we’re pretty tough to beat.” 
Bernstein said. “(I’m) really 
proud of the way we competed 
(Saturday) with Kate out.”

The Wolverines will look to 

get healthy and back on their 

feet this week. 
They 
begin 

conference play 
in East Lansing 
against 
Michigan State 
on 
Saturday 

in 
hopes 
of 

defending 
their Big Ten 
Championship 
from last year. 
But 
as 
they 

head into the tail end of their 
season, their mindset won’t 
change at all.

“We 
just 
need 
to 
keep 

getting 
better,” 
Bernstein 

said. “Nothing’s really going 
to change. We’re just going to 
compete and try to figure it out 
and work hard this week, and 
try to get a win on Saturday.”

If Michigan is able to retain 

its full lineup, with everybody 
healthy, 
perhaps 
the 
slow 

starts that have plagued it can 
be cured.

If 
that’s 
the 
case, 
the 

Wolverines may be able to 
return to their winning ways.

Freshmen make the difference

Schalet, Tishman, 

Tekavec take 

advantage of rare 
opportunity for ‘M’

By MAGGIE KOLCON 

For the Daily

The Michigan men’s tennis 

team’s Saturday doubleheader 
against Columbia and Toledo 
opened up opportunities for 
its younger players, and they 
took full advantage of them. 
Freshmen Myles Schalet, Gabe 
Tishman and Maks Tekavec 
proved themselves with singles 
wins for the Wolverines in the 
5-2 victory against the Rockets.

Tekavec, 
who 
hails 
from 

Slovenia, won his first singles 
match in a Michigan jersey.

“Maks’ first win, it’s always 

awesome to see,” said Michigan 
head coach Adam Steinberg. 
“You know, he’s had it tough. He 
had surgery in December, and 
he’s been trying to get back. He’s 
had some setbacks, so I was just 
happy he was playing.”

Tekavec earned his 6-3, 6-3 

win in the No. 5 singles match.

“We just put them in how we 

felt they should be,” Steinberg 
said. “We tried to push Maks 
a little bit and say, ‘Hey, you’re 
going to play a little bit higher.’ ”

Schalet won 6-2, 6-1, in the 

No. 4 singles match against 
Toledo, adding to his earlier 
6-2, 7-5 win in the No. 6 singles 
match against the Lions. His 
wins were crucial in meets 
where Michigan’s top players 
faltered. Redshirt sophomore 
Alex Knight, who holds the 
Wolverines’ highest singles win 
percentage this year, lost both 
of his No. 1 singles matches, 
while sophomore Carter Lin 
had to retire against Toledo 
in the No. 2 match due to an 
apparent injury.

“Tennis-wise, I still want 

to work on my serve,” Schalet 
said. “I mean, every shot, I 
can still improve. But the most 
important thing is that we’ve 
done a great job and we’re 
getting better.”

Tishman rounded out the 

Toledo match with a 6-2, 6-2 
win, making his mark on the 
match as well.

In the morning meet, Schalet 

and Tishman teamed up to win 
their doubles match together 
against Columbia. Later in the 
day, they held a commanding 
lead against the Rockets, but the 
match 
went 

unfinished 
after 
their 

teammates on 
the first and 
third 
courts 

won 
just 

before 
they 

wrapped up.

Even 

though this is 
their first year 
at 
Michigan, 

Schalet and Tishman have a 
history of dominating the court 
together. 

“Before we came to college, 

we played for about three years 
together in juniors,” Tishman 
said. “Every national open we 

played, we got some pretty good 
results. I think we got up to No. 
2 in the country at one point. So 
we’ve been playing for a while.”

Coming from playing junior 

tennis, freshmen have to make 
the switch from focusing on 
their own individual rankings to 
playing as a team. Frequently in 
college tennis, one matchup will 

go unfinished 
in every meet 
because 
the 

team 
has 

already 
won, 

so 
the 
final 

singles 
or 

doubles match 
doesn’t matter.

“College is 

much 
more 

intense,” 
Schalet 
said. 

“Because you’re playing for 
your team, and it’s a different 
atmosphere.”

That 
atmosphere 
is 
very 

team-centric. 
After 
almost 

every point, players would look 
over to their teammates on a 

different court and shout words 
of encouragement. But, to the 
Wolverines, there is still room 
for improvement.

“I think we just need to work 

on our team dynamics, really,” 
Tishman 
said. 
“Our 
coach 

really enforces this sort of team 
play, supporting everyone, and 
that’s just a big transition from 
juniors, where we’re playing for 
ourselves. We did a great job of 
that today and this morning, so 
we just have to keep that going.”

Added 
Schalet: 
“Everyone 

needs to still improve at playing 
for each other and connecting 
(with their teammates). It’s 
really tough against really good 
teams, and that’s where we’re 
going to make a big jump in the 
next couple weeks.”

While the freshmen admit 

that there are definitely things to 
improve upon, they proved they 
can rise to the occasion when 
their upperclassmen falter. And 
on their path to development, 
that was still certainly a step in 
the right direction. 

Starting pitching 
propels Michigan

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

Coming into its series against 

Hawaii, the Michigan baseball 
team had a cumulative earned-
run average of 1.44 — the fourth-
lowest in the country.

The 18th-ranked Wolverines 

continued their dominance on 
the mound against the Rainbow 
Warriors 
this 
weekend. 
The 

starters pitched especially well 
for Michigan, surrendering a 
combined four earned runs during 
Michigan’s four-game sweep. The 
Wolverines’ team ERA now stands 
firm at 1.83 — holding their spot of 
fourth in the nation.

“The thing that continues to 

impress me and the thing that I’m 
excited about the most with this 
group, and that’s the character, 
the makeup, the intangible skill 
set that this team has,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich.

Junior 
left-hander 
Brett 

Adcock earned Big Ten Pitcher 
of the Week honors with his 
performance in Michigan’s 6-5 
victory Friday. He threw seven 
innings, gave up two hits and one 
run, walked two and struck out 12 
— a career high for him.

In spite of Adcock’s dominant 

outing, he was not awarded the 
win as the Rainbow Warriors 
scored three runs in the bottom of 
the ninth inning to send the game 
into an extra frame. 

But junior designated hitter 

Harrison Wenson came through 
in the top of the 10th with a 
single to drive in the winning 
run for the Wolverines.

“Brett 
Adcock 
was 

commanding his fastball down 
in the zone on both sides of the 
plate,” Bakich said. “When you 
command your fastball down in 
the zone and you can manipulate 

the ball on both sides of the plate 
and the velocity is 92, 93, 94, it 
doesn’t matter who your are as a 
hitter. That’s tough.”

Adcock agreed with Bakich’s 

assessment.

“I tried to attack the zone, let 

the defense work and let the guys 
behind me make plays,” Adcock 
said. “You have to trust your 
defense and let them work.”

Not to be outdone, sophomore 

left-hander Oliver Jaskie turned 
in a gem in Michigan’s 6-0 win 
Thursday. He pitched 5.1 shutout 
innings, 
allowed 
three 
hits, 

walked three and struck out three.

“Everyone who goes out (to 

the mound) seems to do a very 
good job of attacking the strike 
zone with multiple pitches,” 
Bakich said.

The Wolverines’ defense — 

which struggled at times during 
its Spring Break trip to California 
— was not perfect, but performed 
better against Hawaii. Though 
Michigan committed three errors 
in the first contest of Saturday’s 
doubleheader, it was a different 
story in Friday’s game.

In the bottom of the ninth, 

following a wild pitch by right-
hander Bryan Pall, sophomore 
catcher Drew Lugbauer made 
a strong throw to Pall to tag a 
runner out and prevent Hawaii 
from winning the game.

“The errors we made were 

aggressive,” Bakich said. “I was 
very pleased with our defense, I 
thought we played outstanding 
defense. We had an error on a 
pickoff throw, I don’t feel like 
those errors affected the outcome 
of the game. I feel good about our 
defense. I feel like we’ve got a very 
good defensive team, even though 
the fielding percentage may not 
accurately reflect how good the 
defense is.”

Robinson ready for D-I tourney

By SIMON KAUFMAN 

Daily Sports Editor

Two years ago, on the first 

Sunday 
of 
March, 
Duncan 

Robinson crammed into his 
coaches’ 
offices 
with 
his 

Williams College teammates as 
they awaited their fate in the 
Division III NCAA Tournament.

There was no fancy primetime 

two-hour Selection Sunday show, 
no texts pouring in from family 
afterward and no media waiting 
to talk with the team afterward. 
Robinson — then a freshman at 
the small Williamstown, Mass., 
liberal arts college — watched 
on an online stream as his team’s 
name was called. Williams was 
going to the Big Dance, except it 
wasn’t that big of a deal — it was 
only Division III, after all.

Fast forward two years, and 

Robinson — now a redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 
for 
the 

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

team after transferring from 
Williams — will get a taste of 

the big Big Dance: the Division 
I NCAA Tournament.

The 
NCAA 
Tournament 

Selection Committee announced 
Sunday that the Wolverines 
would play Tulsa in Dayton, 
Ohio, as part of the tournament’s 
First Four. A win Wednesday 
would give them a No. 11 seed and 
a Friday night matchup against 
No. 
6 
seed 

Notre Dame in 
Brooklyn, N.Y.

In 
2014, 

Robinson 
helped 
lead 

the Ephs to the 
championship 
game 
and 
a 

runner-up 
finish. But even 
so, 
playing 

at 
that 
level 

meant their Selection Sunday 
prior to the tournament had a 
different feel to it.

“We had a little viewing party 

— I guess you could call it, in 
our coaches’ offices, but nothing 

to this scale,” Robinson said. 
“There was no media afterwards, 
I can tell you that.”

On 
Sunday, 
Robinson 
got 

a 
different 
experience. 
The 

Wolverines watched this year’s 
Selection Sunday show from 
the Weiser Crisler Center Club 
— a club level-esque area of the 
arena, and afterward, about 

two 
dozen 

members 
of 

the 
media 

waited to hear 
from 
players 

and Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein.

“The 

scale is a lot 
different, hard 
to 
compare,” 

Robinson 

said. “When we got into the 
tournament at Williams, I might 
have gotten one text from my 
mom. This time, I got a few more, 
I guess you could say.”

More recognition, be it texts 

from friends or shoutouts from 
noted college basketball analysts, 
has been a theme for Robinson 
since arriving in Ann Arbor.

After sitting out the 2014-15 

season due to NCAA transfer 
rules, Robinson has made a 
name for himself at the Division 
I level. The New Castle, N.H., 
native broke into Michigan’s 
starting lineup in its 10th game 
and has been a staple since. He 
has paced 11.2 points per game 
to go along with 3.3 rebounds 
and has been the Wolverines’ 
best look from 3-point range, 
shooting at a 45-percent clip 
from deep.

Despite 
his 
success, 

Robinson’s numbers dropped off 
midway through the season as he 
struggled to find his stroke. After 
starting the season shooting 
better than 50 percent through 
21 games from beyond the arc, 
Robinson shot worse than 30 
percent from the perimeter in 
Michigan’s final 10 regular-
season games. But in the Big Ten 
Tournament, Robinson regained 
a bit of his rhythm, going off for 
21 points against Northwestern 
and hitting a clutch 3 against 
Indiana that set Michigan up for 
a buzzer-beating victory.

“This has been such a great 

learning experience for him,” 
Beilein said. “For right now, it just 
gives him another opportunity 
to validate that his performance 
in the Big Ten, both hitting 
clutch shots and just playing a 
lot of minutes in the Big Ten —
rebounding and having assists in 
the tournament — validated why 
he’s here.”

Robinson validated himself 

as a Division I player during 
the regular season. Now he has 
the opportunity to do it in the 
postseason.

“This 
is 
why 
I 
came 

here,” Robinson said. “(The) 
opportunity to play in the NCAA 
Tournament. … You build it up 
in your head, but that moment 
when you hear your name called 
is pretty surreal.”

Connor (POY), Wolverines
nearly sweep Big Ten awards

Compher, Motte, 
Connor all earn 
first-team honors; 

Berenson COY

By JUSTIN MEYER 

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan took home six Big 

Ten hockey awards Monday 
afternoon, led by star freshman 
forward Kyle Connor as Player of 
the Year.

“It’s a great accomplishment 

and I’m really honored,” Connor 
said. “It’s pretty cool.”

The nod is an indication 

that 
the 
quiet 
left-winger 

has separated himself among 
Michigan’s stars in the Hobey 
Baker 
race. 
After 
posting 

61 points in 34 games, he is 
considered by many voters to be 
the frontrunner. Boston College’s 
Jack Eichel won the Hobey in his 
first season with near-identical 
points per game numbers last 
year, but freshmen have only 
won the award twice and never 
in back-to-back seasons.

The accolades didn’t stop 

there. 
In 
a 
perhaps 
more 

impressive 
honor, 
the 
CCM 

line — composed of Connor and 
junior forwards Tyler Motte and 
JT Compher — swept the first-
team All-Big Ten awards.

Michigan coach Red Berenson 

said it was the first time he could 
remember that happening.

“We’ve had some great lines — 

and maybe some that could’ve or 
should’ve (swept the first team 
selections) — but this one did,” 
Berenson said.

The CCM line has been the 

most dominant in college hockey 
this season. Connor, Compher 
and Motte rank first, third and 
fifth in the NCAA for points, 
respectively. The line began to 
jell after Christmas and never 
slowed down. Connor is in the 
midst of a 23-game point streak 
and Tyler Motte set a modern-

day Michigan record with a 
12-game goal streak.

“I think we’ve just become 

more vocal with each other 
as linemates,” Compher said. 
“It’s easier said than done to be 
all equal when you’re older or 
younger, freshman, junior, senior 
or whatever it 
is, but I think 
we’ve actually 
done a really 
good 
job 
of 

being open to 
suggestions.”

Sophomore 

defender Zach 
Werenski 
was 
named 

Defensive 
Player of the 
Year and added to the All-Big 
Ten First Team. The 18-year-old 
recorded 51 blocked shots and 28 
points. Werenski emboldened 
his case with six points in the 
last three games, bringing him 
from 15th to tied for fifth among 
all defenseman.

Berenson was also named 

Big Ten Coach of the Year — his 
third such honor in 32 years of 
coaching. Berenson previously 
won two coaching awards in the 
CCHA.

“As far as the coach award, 

that usually goes to the team that 

overachieves 
and does better 
than 
people 

expect,” 
Berenson said. 
“If 
we 
did, 

that’s a tribute 
to our players 
and our whole 
coaching staff 
— it’s no longer 
a 
one-man 

coaching job.”

Berenson is in the final year 

of his contract and undecided 
on his coaching future. Under 
his 
watch 
this 
season, 
the 

Wolverines are a lock to make 
the NCAA Tournament for the 
first time in four years.

“I don’t get too carried away 

with these coaching awards,” 
Berenson said. “We’ve had years 
where I think we’ve done a 
great job coaching the team we 
had into overachieving, but we 
weren’t the Coach of the Year.

“Nowadays, I think its more a 

sign of respect and age.”

Senior 
forward 
Boo 

Nieves 
rounded 
out 
the 

awards, receiving the Big Ten 
sportsmanship honor.

In a down year for the Big Ten, 

Michigan shined this season. 
The Wolverines enter the Big 
Ten Tournament with a sure 
spot in the NCAA Tournament, 
the highest-scoring team offense 
in more than a decade and three 
viable Hobey Baker candidates.

The true rewards — a Big 

Ten 
or 
NCAA 
Tournament 

title — are still to be had, but 
the 
announcements 
Monday 

afternoon gave an opportunity to 
reflect on the remarkable regular-
season run Michigan strung 
together, 
and 
the 
individual 

heroics that made it possible.

Breaking down the 
dramatic shots that 
powered Michigan

By LEV FACHER 

Daily Sports Writer

It’s 
easy 
to 
attribute 

Michigan’s NCAA Tournament 
bid to a single shot: sophomore 
guard Kam Chatman’s already 
legendary 
3-pointer 
against 

top-seeded Indiana in the Big 
Ten Tournament quarterfinals 
on Friday.

Chatman, deservedly, walked 

away from the weekend an 
unlikely star. He had made just 
seven 3-pointers on the season 
before a case of mistaken identity 
left him with the ball in his hands 
and time ticking down, and his 
game-winner left fans around 
the country with an early taste of 
the madness March is known for.

But two other shots were 

equally 
instrumental 
in 

shoehorning the Wolverines 
into 
the 
68-team 
NCAA 

Tournament field.

One 
shot 
came 
Thursday 

against 
Northwestern 
on 
a 

play that Michigan coach John 
Beilein calls “Magic,” a set 
for redshirt sophomore guard 
Duncan Robinson to find space 
around the perimeter. Many 
might have expected Beilein to 
call Robinson’s number, but the 
audacity of the play call stood out.

Michigan perfectly executed 

the sneaky set, in which Robinson 
inbounded the ball from the 
sideline, gave it to junior forward 
Zak Irvin curling along the 
baseline and then took the outside 
route on a screen from sophomore 
forward Ricky Doyle to give 
himself enough space for a shot 
after Irvin gave the ball back. 

Without Robinson’s trey and 

Beilein’s play call, Chatman 
would never have been in a 
position to play hero the next day.

“I think Stan Van Gundy was 

probably the coach of Orlando 
at the time, and I was just there 
watching an NBA game one 
time,” Beilein said on “Inside 
Michigan 
Basketball,” 
his 

weekly radio show, on Monday. 
“The Magic needed a 3, and 
Orlando ran this play for J.J. 
Redick. So I looked at it, and 
I said, ‘We’ve got to run that 
play.’ To this day, we’ve called 
it Magic.”

Beilein said he first installed 

the play three or four seasons ago 
for Tim Hardaway Jr., now with 
the NBA’s Atlanta Hawks. But 
the Wolverines hadn’t used the 
play before Friday, when Beilein 
drew it up for Robinson during a 
frantic, late-game timeout.

“It’s not even out there on a 

scouting report the last three 

or four years,” Beilein said. “We 
drew it up, we practice it once 
a week, at least — it seems like 
Duncan makes it every time. 
But when (Northwestern center 
Alex) Olah came out on him, Olah 
was huge. And Duncan, when we 
looked at the shot, the ball went 
a good three or four feet above 
the backboard, and Duncan’s 
shot usually arcs out below the 
backboard. So he had to put extra 
on it, and he just buried it.”

It was a lot of faith to put 

in Robinson, a transfer from 
Division III Williams College. 
The moment wasn’t too big for 
him — nor was his shot the next 
day against Indiana, which tied 
the game at 69 to set up Chatman 
for the game-winner moments 
later. That Robinson 3, while 
equally instrumental, came on a 
more orthodox play call.

Beilein discussed yet another 

non-Chatman 
shot 
that 
the 

Wolverines 
simply 
couldn’t 

have done without on Monday: 
Irvin’s overtime jumper with 
time winding down against 
Northwestern, which came just 
minutes after the unexpected 
Robinson 3.

“He loves that moment,” 

Beilein said of his decision to give 
Irvin the ball for the overtime 
period’s final play. “I had dialed 
him up two or three plays before 
in the Northwestern game, 
and he missed the shot, and he 
wasn’t having a great night. And 
I said to myself, ‘Why do I keep 
dialing him up? I’ve got to do 
something else.’ ”

Luckily for Michigan, Beilein’s 

idea to stay away from Irvin in 
the final moments didn’t stick 
around for long.

“When we wanted to run that 

last play, (Northwestern) knew 
what we were running,” Beilein 
said. “It’s a play we run once or 
twice, at least, a game. I said, 
‘Who do I trust out there right 
now to make this shot or make 
the right decision?’ Because 
(Doyle) was open rolling to the 
basket as well. He was wide open. 
I said, ‘It’s Zak.’ So I went to him, 
and it certainly paid off.”

Michigan is hoping no such 

late-game drama is necessary 
Wednesday in Dayton, Ohio, as 
it takes on fellow 11-seed Tulsa 
in a First Four play-in game. The 
Wolverines’ bus embarked on 
the three-hour drive Monday 
night — a trip that could end 
Wednesday night with a loss or 
last through Sunday if Michigan 
can get through Tulsa and then 
No. 6-seed Notre Dame on Friday 
in Brooklyn, N.Y.
