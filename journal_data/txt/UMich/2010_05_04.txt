President calls for
civil discourse and
active participation
By JACOB SMILOVITZ
and KYLE SWANSON
Editor in Chief and Daily News Editor
President Barack Obama chal-
lenged the political status quo in a
speech before more than 80,000 at
the University of Michigan's spring
commencement Saturday, calling
on graduates to embrace change as
a means of strengthening the coun-

try's democracy for years to come.
Obama's speech in Michigan
Stadium was a clear denunciation
of the current state of American
politics - an environment he said is
never a place for the "thin-skinned
or faint-of-heart" but has recently
been pushed further by the "incred-
ibly difficult moment in which we
find ourselves as a nation."
Through his words, the president
attempted to convey his notion of
citizenship to the maturatinggener-
ation before him. He tried at times
to reshape current conceptions of
small and big government, pushed
for a more civil political discourse

commencement.
Quarton, who will be moving to

mencement address on Saturday "sent

State police evict homeless community

Deemed trespassers,
tent city residents forced
to relocate
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
Last Tuesday, while University stu-
dents were busy studying for finals and
city officials were preparing for Presi-
dent Barack Obama's visit to campus, a
small communityofhomeless individu-
als living just south of campus faced an
ultimatum - relocate or risk prosecu-
tion.
This group of homeless individuals
took up residence in a wooded patch of
public land near interstate I-94 and Ann
Arbor-Saline Road. But after Michigan
State Police issued a notice that the
residence constituted trespassing, the
group was forced to pack up and relo-
cate, raising questions about the rights
of Ann Arbor's homeless population.
The group, called Camp Take Notice,
is a tent community of homeless Ann
Arbor citizens that, according to its
website, aims to "provide a safe, sober
and drug-free tent city, where the
homeless population can receive food
and shelter."
Tate Williams, a current resident of
CTN, said he and Caleb Poirier, a native
of Ann Arbor, sat down together more

than twoyears ago to hash out the rules
and bylaws of the camp. With the val-
ues of "interdependence and self-gov-
ernance" in place, Williams said the
camp was ready to grow.
CTN was inspired by a larger net-
work of tent cities in Seattle, Wash-
ington. Poirer, who lived at one of the
Seattle camps for two years, said he
wanted to bring the vision back to Ann
Arbor.
Poirer said CTN is looking to partner
with local churches willing to donate
private land for the camp, but after
two years of meetings with pastors and
church board members, it has had no
luck.
Poirier added that he understands
that the prospect of taking on a home-
less community is daunting, but he is
confident that somewhere there is a
church that is up to the task.
"It's very scary if you haven't seen it
done before," he said. "I have no doubt
that as long as this group sticks togeth-
er, we will crack the egg."
"The churches themselves want to
give the support, but the people within
that church community still have the
stigma (against the homeless)," Wil-
liams said.
Robert Braun, one of the camp's 13
residents as of Saturday, spoke highly of
CTN and the community environment.
"I think people are just more happy
here," said Braun. "I just like the envi-

ronment here. It's quiet. It's peaceful."
Jessie Rossman, a staff attorney with
the American Civil Liberties Union of
Michigan, praised CTN's vision and its
willingness to assist homeless people.
"They maintain themselves, and this
is exactly the type of (community) we
should be allowing to happen," she said.
The ACLU issued a press release last
Wednesday, stating that it was "gravely
concerned" by the eviction of the home-
less community from the public land.
Rossman added that the reloca-
tion violated the rights of camp resi-
dents, saying, "It's simply not a crime
to be homeless." However, she said the
forced relocation could promote dia-
logue about the ethical treatment of
homeless people.
"We think that this is the perfect
opportunity to put our most positive
foot forward and use this as a time to
show... the way that Michigan can treat
the homeless," she said. "I think, in the
short term, what the ACLU really hopes
is (that) we can use this as an opportu-
nity to meet with state officials...and
think about some common sense solu-
tions."
Brian Nord, a Rackham student and
the president of the board of directors
for Michigan Itinerant Shelter System:
Interdependent out of Necessity - a
non-profit organization in Ann Arbor
that supports local tent cities - said the
issue of CTN trespassing on state land
boils down to the camp residents' con-
stitutional rights.
Nord said he believes evicting the
residents of CTN would violate their
constitutional rights to due process and
to protection from cruel and unusual

punishment.
"You have to establish that the bur-
den on the people whose rights you
think are being violated... is larger than
the burden on the public," he said.
Michigan State Police Lt. Wynonia
Sturdivant said, in an interview with
The Wall Street Journal, that the police
informed the residents that they were
trespassing, but ultimately, the choice
to move was their own.
"I didn't remove them," Sturdivant
told the reporter. "They voluntarily
moved."
But Nord said that Sturdivant's por-
trayal of the situation was misleading
and unfairly removed accountability
from the state police.
"The threat of being evicted and
thrown in jail is a forceful movement,"
Nord said. "And for her to say it in that
way is... not telling the entire story."
Michigan State Police Sgt. Chris
Pascoe said the eviction was the culmi-
nation of a long effort to remove CTN
from state land.
"We've been trying to throw them
out over the last year or so. Since last
October, we've probably been in there
10 times," Pascoe said. "They're tres-
passing on state land. It's a health issue
obviously. There are no facilities there
for them. They're basically squatting on
state land there, and we've had a lot of
complaints."
The complaints received by the state
police have not come from the pub-
lic but rather mostly from within the
camp, according to Pascoe. One such
complaint, he said, was a case of domes-
tic violence that involved a stabbing.

Smoking ban
takes effect,

discuss fall agenda,

calls for candid talks

* Statewide ban makes
Michigan restaurants
and bars smoke-free
By RACHEL BRUSSTAR
Daily StaffReporter
Though the University's campus-
wide smoking ban will not go into
effect until July of next year, a new
statewide ban on smoking has Ann
Arbor restaurants and bars turning
away patrons who choose to light up,
sending them outside instead.
The Michigan smoke-free legisla-
tion, which went into effect on Sat-
urday, forbids all cigarette and cigar
use in workplaces, including bars,
restaurants and offices. As a com-
promise between the interests of
both smokers and nonsmokers, the
mandate permits smoking directly
outside of work establishments.
According to the new law, cigar
and hookah bars will be able to
remain open provided that they file
an affidavit with the state of Michi-
gan.
Following the lead of other states,
Michigan is now the 38th state to
implement legislation that bans
smoking in public areas. California
became the first state to pass a work-
place smoking ban in 1998.
Jim Bergman, a member of the
University's Tobacco Research Net-
work and director of the Smoke-Free
Environments Law Project at the
Center for Social Gerontology, said
he believes that the initiative will
reduce the exposure of restaurant

Schneidt said, "She comes fast

ing against a player that is that

The same article incorrectly states

Bergman said the ban will also
help smokers cut down on the fre-
quency of their cigarette use by lim-
iting the number of places available
for them to smoke legally.
In anticipation of the heated
debate between smokers and non-
smokers, the University has assem-
bled a body of experts to discuss the
smoking ban and its impact on local
restaurants and bars.
Cliff Douglas, an adjunct lecturer
in health management and policy
at the University's School of Public
Health and a consultant on tobacco
control policy to the U.S. Assistant
Secretary for Health, said he is very
optimistic about the economic ben-
efits that the ban will bring to Ann
Arbor restaurants.
Douglas, who is also the director
of the University's Tobacco Research
Network, said restaurants in other
states have reported that their busi-
ness has remained steady and, in
some cases, have even improved,
since the enactment of their state's
smoking ban. The reported finan-
cial stability, he added, should be
encouraging to business owners.
Prior to the statewide ban, certain
restaurants and bars in Michigan
already enforced a smoke-free policy
- notably in cases where competi-
tors did not the dispute the provi-
sions of the ban.
"The response (to the smoking
ban) has been very positive," Doug-
las said. "Not everybody agrees, but
the vast majority is very support-
ive."

In a meeting with the Senate
Advisory Committee on University
Affairs yesterday, newly appointed
chair of the committee Ed Rothman
spoke about the importance of open
meetings and open dialogue between
members.
A professor statistics at the Uni-
versity, Rothman said he wanted
"very few executive sessions," which,
under current rules, are currently
closed off to the public and members
of the press. He added that, to create
a more open atmosphere, members
of SACUA - the leading faculty gov-
ernance body on campus - ought to
voice their opinions on the meeting's
proceedings before critiquing each
other's viewpoints.
Rothman said he was also con-
cerned about the way in which
motions are currently brought up in
meetings, stating that the rules and
discussions within the committee
limit the immediate effectiveness of
its actions.
"I'm looking for a procedure that

speaks mostly to us understanding
where we want to go, and that is not
so caught up in the rules that we use
them to move in a slightly different
direction," Rothman said.
Though some members voiced
concern that extended discussions
have led to a stalemate in the past,
Rothman said he felt the new form
of discourse could also give voices
to those who would not normally be
heard.
"What's practical about it is that
there may be perspectives that
weren't represented before that may
be the right answer, and there maybe
perspectives that attract the major-
ity of us (that) might be the wrong
answer," he said.
In addition to deliberating on the
future structure of meetings, SACUA
members also suggested ideas for the
fall agenda during yesterday's meet-
ing.
Rothman brought up the issue
underlying the potential switch from
the University's current ITS e-mail
server to a Google e-mail server,
which would be free but might
include advertisements.

Granholm approves ban on texting while driving
The state is saying "ttyl" to texting while driving. A day before
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm spoke to a crowd of Uni-
versity graduates in the Big House, she appeared on "The Oprah
Winfrey Show" to sign the ban into law. The new legislation will make
the act a primary offense, slapping hundred-dollar fines -on violators.
While action must be taken to curb distracted driving, the state must
ensure that the law is implemented and enforced fairly, with proper

As the vigorous applause finally
began to subside in the wake of Presi-
dent Barack Obama taking the stage
Saturday at spring commencement, a
lone "I love you!" rang out amidst the
crowd. The president didn't hesitate.
He responded with an eager, "I love
you back." Such is the relationship
between Obama and the class of 2010.
After all, we certainly showed
Obama our love during the '08 cam-
paign, when University students
pulled out all the stops to make sure
he was elected. Students' relentless
campaigning, voter-registering and
city-wide canvassing on behalf of
Obama was the reality of life in Ann
Arbor last year. It was gratifying,
then, to see Obama acknowledge the
support this campus showed him by
attending our graduation ceremony
- even for those like me who usually
don't love the president back.
Besides, I was relieved that Demo-
cratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm (who
was clearly sucking up to Obama in
hopes of landing a Supreme Court
appointment) had finished her incred-
ibly awkward on-behalf-of-Michigan-
thanks-for-all-the-bailouts speech,
which was neither appropriate nor
particularly accurate.
So when the president stepped
up to speak and my fellow gradu-
ates burst into cheers, I applauded
as well. There'sno denying it at the
University, Obama is a popular man.
But if Obama's presence at spring
commencement was a testament to
his popularity on college campuses,
his speech addressed the reality that
elsewhere, people aren't as pleased
with him. Speaking more to his oppo-
nents across the nation rather than
those present in the Big House, the
president recognized the merits of
informed disagreement while criti-
cizing the lack of civility in current
political debate.
He blamed politicians and pundits
for driving the argument to the left
and right fringes, reserving particu-
larly harsh words for a media that
"tends to play up every hint of con-
flict, because it makes for a sexier
story, which means anyone interested
in getting coverage feels compelled to
make their arguments as outrageous
and as incendiary as possible." That's
right, the president used the word

"sexier" in the Big House.
Obama said that he sympathizes
with people's frustration and the
effect it has been having on politi-
cal discourse. But he called upon all
factions of American society to listen
to each other in hopes of moving for-
ward and making compromises that
will improve both the government
and the country. Such sentiments are
certainly noble, and they were deliv-
ered with the eloquence of a presi-
dent who gives terrific speeches, no
matter what you may think of his
policies.
But Obama's speech also revealed
that there's something he doesn't
fully understand - the sincerity of
his opponents. While University
graduates nod along to his words and
wonder why those awful Tea Party
protesters and their ilk just won't
listen to reason, there are millions of
people who think that the president
is the one who isn't listening. As evi-
dence, they point to the passage of
a health care bill that Obamavehe-
mently backed - a bill completely
despised by about half the country,
according to several opinion polls.
Many U.S. taxpayers and business
owners worry that Obama's agenda
will make them less prosperous,
reduce their freedoms and leave
their children with an overwhelming
national debt. In their view, Obama is
the one who won't compromise, and
that's at least part of the reason why
the debate seems less civil.
. Still, the president was right to
maintain a historical perspective and
recognize that political debate in the
U.S. has often been less than civil. As
he noted (as did Alex Marsten in his
terrifically clever and heartfelt stu-
dent address), it is up to us, college
graduates entering a world of pas-
sionate opinions, to add something
intelligent and constructive to the
debate.
Thanks for sending us off into
the professional world with your
eloquent advice, Mr. President. But
don't pick Granholm for the Supreme
Court, no matter how badly she
wants it.

safeguards against abus
In January, the State Sen-
ate passed a bill deeming tex-
ting while driving a secondary
offense. This meant that a driver
could not be pulled over solely
for texting while driving but
could be charged additional fees
for texting if he or she is pulled
over for another reason. The
legislation recently approved by
Granholm declared the action a
primary offense, meaning that
police officers will be able to
pull over a driver exclusively
for texting and driving. While
no points would be added to the
violator's driving record, he or
she would be charged a $100 fine
for the first offense and $200 for
subsequent ones, according to
The Associated Press.
There's no doubt that texting
- and other distracting activi-
ties like talking on a cell phone
- while driving is extremely
dangerous. The National High-
way Traffic Safety Administra-
tion reported that, in 2008, 5,870
people died and nearly half a
million people were injured as a

result of accidents involving dis-
tracted drivers. Texting while
driving is a growing problem
and a danger for all drivers, not
just those who text. It is without
question that some sort of legis-
lation was necessary to make the
state's roads safer.
But Michigan isn't the only
state to recognize the dangers of
texting while driving. Accord-
ing to the Governors Highway
Safety Association, there are
24 states that currently ban the
practice. There is a growing
realization among state govern-
ments of the need to take action
themselves to deter distract-
ed driving, as allowing local
authorities to make the deci-
sion has produced a haphazard
patchwork of different laws gov-
erning each separate communi-
ty. It's about time that Michigan
joined these other states in a
concerted effort to combat and
reduce the dangers of texting
while driving.
While maintaining the vio-
lation as a secondary offense

would have prevented many
potential problems with the new
law, it is now the responsibility
of police officers to implement
and enforce the new regulations
appropriately. It is inherently
difficult to determine whether
someone is texting while driv-
ing or using a cell phone in a
legal manner, such as dialing
a phone number. Proper safe-
guards must be implemented
to ensure that law enforcement
officials do not use the presence
of a cell phone outside of the
driver's pocket as a presumption
of guilt. Police officers enforcing
this new law must remember
that its intent is to keep roads
safe, not make a suspect of any-
one on the road carrying a cell
phone.
Texting while driving not
only endangers the offender -
it creates a hazard for everyone
on the road. But this legislation
will only serve its goal properly
if it is enforced in a way that
doesn't presume all drivers to be
potential violators.

BELLA SHAH

E-MAIL BELLAAT BELLZ@UMICH.EDU

T he pro-military feminist
in me loves Thursdays.
On Thursdays, the female
midshipmen of
the University's
Navy ROTC unit
are dressed in
their uniforms,
hair neatly braid-
ed or arranged in
a bun. And even
though the hats
they're required VA ER
to wear are
kind of ugly, I'm
always proud of them in a patri-
otic, girl-power sort of way.
The women of the University's
Naval ROTC (NROTC) - and
women from NROTC units across
the nation - are about to get a new
service option after college that
women in the Navy have never
had before: They could be chosen
to serve aboard submarines.
According to an Apr. 29 report
by the Navy Times, Navy officials
expect to choose which women
will be the first to join submarine
crews by the end of 2011. Navy
officials first announced plans to
station women on submarines on
Feb. 19 but were required by law
to give Congress time to raise
objections. But the deadline for
congressional intervention passed
at midnight on Apr. 28. Female
officers who will work in engi-
neering positions will be chosen
for submarine jobs from a pool of
officers commissioned since 2008.
The move also creates several
open positions for female supply
officers.
I come from a Navy family. My
father served in the Navy and was
a member of the NROTC when
he attended the University in the
1970s. My older sister was in the
NROTC at the University before
she graduated and is currently an
ensign in the Navy. And now, my
younger sister is a member of the
NROTC unit and just completed
her freshman year in the College
of Engineering. All three are (or
will be) engineers.
Most people probably think
that the reason it took the Navy
so long to allow women on sub-
marines stems from deeply
ingrained sexism in the military.
But that's not really the case.
Women haven't been permitted
to serve on submarines largely
for logistical reasons. In fact, it's
been a long time since anyone
thought that women couldn't
hack it during six-month under-
water deployments.
The problem is space. Subma-

rines are already a tight fit, so
tight that members of the crew
often share beds. There isn't much
space to provide women with sep-
arate bathing facilities. Arriving
at a solution to these problems is
why progress took so long, even
though there has been discussion
for years of changing regulations
that allowed only men on sub-
marines. As it is, only the largest
class of submarine, the Ohio class,
will be retrofitted to house crew-
members of both sexes because it
is the only class that won't require
major overhauls.
The Navy is
smart to use all
of its resources.
The Navy should find a way to
tap into all the talent at its dispos-
al, regardless of sex - and they
know it. That's why it has decided
to find a way to utilize its full pool
of resources.
For my sisters and other female
Navy personnel, this could mean
the chance to work with some
impressive technology. U.S. sub-
marines - and aircraft carriers,
on which women have been per-
mitted to serve for years - are
powered by nuclear reactors. To
qualify to operate this advanced
(and expensive) technology,
officers chosen for service on
nuclear-powered vessels have to
complete 15 months of school-
ing in nuclear power. For women,
who have traditionally been less
involved in science and technol-
ogy and have had fewer opportu-
nities in the military, the Navy's
decision is a sign of progress. It's
also a great prospect for women at
colleges like the University who
are qualified to work with nuclear
technology.
My older sister was assigned
to the nuclear power program for
surface ships before she gradu-
ated from college, and she is now
eligible to apply for a submarine
position. My younger sister hopes
to qualify for the nuclear program
when she receives her assign-
ment in a few years. They could be
among the first women to serve on
submarines - and that's a pretty
exciting possibility.

Because it's hard

President Obama should have
tested the announcement
of his plans for NASA in
front of a crowd
of third grad-
ers - and prob-
ably also Captain
Kirk. Their reac-
tion might have
been a better
test of his plan's
quality. Instead,
last month, the NICHOLAS
president flew his CLIFT
jumbo jet to Ken- -
nedy Space Center
to tell NASA his vision for its future.
There were some big names there,
like former astronauts Buzz Aldrin
and John Glenn, NASA Administra-
tor Charles Bolden and a crowd of
engineers, scientists and business
leaders - many of the people who
have defined American space explo-
ration for the last 50 years.
There was plenty of applause in
that room, especially when the presi-
dent announced his $40 million ini-
tiative to create jobs in the areas hit
hardest by the ending of the shuttle
program. It was clear he was mak-
ing changes to his original plan for
the space program, undoubtedly in
response to previous outrage over its
apparent lack of priority. But as he
talked about ending the shuttle pro-
gram or cancelling future trips to the
moon, I would have liked to see the
expression on a third grader's face.
For them, the mystique of the space
program has nothing to do with how
many jobs it creates or the practical
applications of space research. For
them, it's about building "castles
in the sky," as goes the song in the
French film, "Les Choristes." Future
generations need to have a space pro-
gram that inspires them.
When I was in third grade, I had
a space shuttle made of LEGOs.
There were buttons you could press

that would cause it to make rocket
sounds. I loved it. I spent asignificant
portion of my childhood flying that
space shuttle around the living room.
Watching the president's speech and
hearing "Stars and Stripes Forever"
piped through the huge assembly
room in which he spoke, I couldn't
help but feel a little unconvinced that
he really, genuinely understands the
impact the space program has on
young people.
I actually agree with most of the
president's plan. For decades, the
space agency has been bogged down
and demoralized by inconsistent
funding from Congress and the con-
stant threat of mission cancellations.
More recently, President George W.
Bush's NASA plan was incompetently
assembled, unreasonable and impos-
sibly underfunded. His initiative to
put humans back on the moon by
2020 - the Constellation program
- had already fallen horribly behind
schedule and over budget by the time
President Obama came into office.
Obama plans to increase NASA's
funding by $6 billion in the coming
fiscal year. He's cancelling the high-
cost Constellation Program in favor
of using private companies to carry
astronauts to the International Space
Station. He plans to extend the life of
the International Space Station and,
in response to widespread concerns
about the lack of vision in his plan
after the release of his budget weeks
before, the president also said he's
interested in deep space. By 2025,
he hopes to have astronauts visit an
asteroid and by the mid-2030's orbit
Mars. "And a landing on Mars will
follow," he said. "And I expect to be
around to see it."
But "I expect to be around to see
it" is a little less powerful than Ken-
nedy demanding moon landings by
the end of the decade, "not because
they are easy, but because they are
hard." And that's what Obama's plan

is really missing. His new direction
for NASA is hopeful, and it will put
the agency on course for real success
in the future. His goals are clearly
attainable. But the third graders,
the future scientists and engineers,
wouldn't have been clapping.
Reason alone
won't inspire
future engineers.
Space is the dream that drives
many engineers and scientists at this
university. In danger of getting over-
ly sentimental, space was the pas-
sion that pushed me to spend a full
summer in middle school picking up
trash toearnmoneyfor a$600 "Mak-
Cass" telescope and the many cold
nights in the driveway that followed.
It was the dream behind waking up
at 4:30 in the morning to watch the
first images arrive from Huygens'
landing on Titan. And frankly, I
would nothave chosen to study engi-
neering without that dream.
I'm getting all sappy because my
experience is far from unique. For
thousands of young people, the space
program is the indispensible motiva-
tion to study math and science. In a
nation bleeding for scientists and
engineers, we simply can't afford
not to make space a priority. That's
partly why, in his letter to Obama,
the iconic former astronaut Neil
Armstrong called elements of the
president's proposal "devastating."
That's why we need a space program
that third graders - not bureaucrats
- can get excited about.

OBAMA
From page 1
and implored graduates to par-
ticipate in their government in the
way they see most fit.
After severe thunderstorms
drenched Ann Arbor Saturday
morning and threatened to under-
mine some of the excitement over
the event, the rain slowed to a
drizzle about an hour out from
the ceremony's start and came to a
complete halt shortly before it was
set to begin. The gray clouds over-
head did linger though throughout
most of the ceremony.
In attendance for Obama's
speech was a big crowd of Univer-
sity and state officials, including
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, Democratic Gov. Jenni-
fer Granholm, University Provost
Teresa Sullivan, University Presi-
dent Emeritus James Duderstadt,
the University's current Board
of Regents and several former
regents.
Those on stage and in the crowd
alike roared when Obama was pre-
sented with his honorary degree
and took to the podium to deliver
his remarks.
As the president approached
the microphone, one person in the
crowd yelled out, "We love you,"
to which Obama responded "I love
you back."
Beginning his speech, Obama
described the current political
atmosphere by highlighting a let-
ter sent to him by a kindergarten
class that included the question,
"Are people being nice?"
"Well, if you turn on the news
today, or yesterday, or a week ago,
or a month ago -particularly one
of the cable channels - you can
see why even a kindergartener
would ask this question," Obama
told the audience.
And while Obama pointed to
name calling by politicians and
pundits and a media that high-
lights "every hint of conflict," he
admitted that recent events have
largely contributed to the charged
political climate.
"The fact is, when you leave here
today you will search for work in
an economy that is still emerging
from the worst crisis since the
Great Depression," Obama said.
"You live in a century where the
speed with which jobs and indus-
tries move across the globe is forc-
ing America to compete like never
before."
However, Obama added that
America has had a long history of
partisan rancor.
"Since the days of our found-
ing, American politics has never
been a particularly nice business,"

Obama said. "It's always been a
little less genteel during times of
great change."
Obama's speech then turned
from these challenges and the
toxic political discourse of today,
to what role graduates must play
to improve the country's democ-
racy in the future.
"And now the question for
your generation is this: how will
you keep our democracy going?"
Obama asked. "At a moment when
our challenges seem so big and our
politics seem so small, how will
you keep our democracy alive and
well in this century?"
While not wishing to offer
"some grand theory or detailed
policy prescription," Obama did
have three ingredients he said he
believes are necessary for a func-
tioning democracy: a limited, yet
adaptive government, the main-
taining of a "basic level of civil-
ity in our public debate" and civic
participation.
On his first point, Obama con-
ceded that there has, since the
days of the Founding Fathers,
been a belief in this country that
government cannot solve every
problem facing its people. But
at the same time, he said many
believe that some problems are too
big for people to solve for them-
selves, "some things we can only
do together."
The president cited a series
of examples of the government's
greatest successes, from the con-
struction of cross-continental rail-
roads to the creation of a system of
public high schools to the imple-
mentation of financial reforms in
the wake of the Great Depression.
Obama sought to blur parti-
san lines surrounding arguments
over the size of government, dis-
cussing massive public initiatives
launched by Republican presi-
dents, like Abraham Lincoln and
the first land-grant colleges, Teddy
Roosevelt's empowering the gov-
ernment to break up monopolies
and Dwight Eisenhower's creation
of the Interstate Highway System.
Eschewing the common par-
tisan argument over big govern-
ment or small government, Obama
reframed the question, asking
instead "how we can create a
smarter, better government."
"Our government shouldn't try
to guarantee results" Obama said,
"but it should guarantee a shot at
opportunity for every American
who's willing to work hard.
"The point is, we can and
should debate the role of govern-
ment in our lives," he continued,
"but remember, as you are asked
to meet the challenges of our time,
that the ability for us to adapt our
government to the needs of the age

has helped make our democracy
work since its inception."
Another way to maintain the
health of the American democ-
racy, Obama said, is by ensuring a
fundamental level of civility in the
political arena.
"You can question somebody's
views and their judgment without
questioning their motives or their
patriotism," he said. "Throw-
ing around phrases like 'social-
ists' and 'Soviet-style takeover'
and 'fascist' and 'right-wing nut'
- that may grab headlines, but
it also has the effect of compar-
ing our government, our political
opponents, to authoritarian, even
murderous regimes."
However, Obama cautioned
graduates that moving away from
such a political culture would not
be easy.
"As I found out after a year in
the White House, changing this
type of politics is not easy," Obama
said. "And part of what civil-
ity requires is that we recall the
simple lesson most of us learned
from our parents: Treat others as
you would like to be treated, with
courtesy and respect."
Obama continued: "But civil-
ity in this age also requires some-
thing more than just asking if we
can't just all get along."

From page 2
Williams said three cases of
domestic assault at the camp indeed
have been reported but that CTN has
a strict non-violence policy and any
resident who violates the policy is
asked to leave. Williams also said the
camp does not present any discern-
ible health concerns.
"It isn't a written rule, but it's cer-
tainly a spoken one - don't make a
mess," he said.
According to Williams, residents
at the I-94 campsite used facilities
available at the nearby Meijer store

from the businesses' respective own-
ers.

weekly group meeting. In attendance
were six residents, including Poirier

Gathered around a fire pit, the
group discussed the eviction notice

move and about life at the camp
in general. With many around the
campfire concerned about CTN's
uncertain future, Poirier assured the
group that it will persevere.
It is still unclear if local authorities
will allow the camp to stay at its new

SPEECH
From page1
In his address to the Class of 2010
Saturday, Obama challenged gradu-
ates to move beyond the partisanship
that has crippled Washington and
encouraged them to be active par-
ticipants in furthering democracy in
America.
Though many graduates said
Obama's message to them and the rest
of country will help make their gradu-
ation from the University extra special,
some said they wished the president
would have spoken more directly to
them, instead of to the nation.
As he said goodbye to his friends
and made plans to meet up after the
ceremony, Business School gradu-
ate Bryan Flory said he didn't find
Obama's speech to be relevant to his
experience at the University.
"It just realistically had nothing
to do with us," he said. "It just had
nothing to do with graduation."
Though he thought it was an honor
to have the president speak at gradu-
ation, Engineering master's student,
Vikram Thakar said he thought the
speech was "too political."
"I've definitely heard him give bet-
ter speeches before," Thakar said.
Rackham graduate Aaron Rury
said he found the speech to be
"pretty standard boiler plate press-
ing (Obama's) political narrative,"
though he added that he found the
part of the ceremony when Obama
conferred the oath of office on the
University's ROTC graduates to be
"pretty cool."
"You have all these ROTC gradu-
ates all over the country and those (at
the University) are probably the only
kids who get to have the president do
that for them so I thought that was
pretty meaningful," he said. "His
speech in general was, you know very
similar to the speech he gave last year
at Notre Dame, when he talked about
trying to have politics of inclusion
rather than exclusion. So I thought it
was predictable almost."
Lucas Strasser who was conferred
by Obama said he found the experi-

ence "very nice."
"There are very few people in
the military that have actually ever
been read the oath of office by the
commander in chief, so it was really
exciting for me to have that honor,"
he said.
Strasser's mother Joy said watch-
ing her son be conferred by the presi-
dent was an extremely proud moment
for her.
"It was the thrill of my life because
I helped campaign for President
Obama and just to be here and have
the honor of having my son join the
service and be an officer and then
to have the oath of office is beyond
words," she said.
Art & Design graduate Alex Friend
said that though he didn't think
Obama's speech was directed at him,
he enjoyed it, adding that he appreci-
ated Obama's humor throughout the
speech.
"I thought Obama's speech was
really interesting," he said. "Seemed
(like) he was concentrating more on
the national issues than on the fact
that we were graduating. But that's
alright, I guess you can expect that
from the president, he's got bigger
matters on his mind."
LSA graduate Kate Heller said that
while she enjoyed Obama's speech,
she was "a little frustrated" by the
remarks of Democratic Gov. Jenni-
fer Granholm, who spoke before the
president.
Other students also said they were
disappointed with Granholm's mes-
sage.
Engineering graduate Neil
Dhingra said he found Granholm's
speech to be "kind of worthless."
"It was more political than it
could've been," he said.
Flory said he agreed.
"What Jennifer Granholm said
really had nothing to do with us," he
said.
While some students found Gran-
holm's message to be less than appro-
priate, many graduates who had the
experience of celebrating Obama's
win on election night said having the
president at their graduation only
enhanced an already happy day.

SAM WOLSON/DAILY
U.S. President Barack Obama's commencement address received mixed responses from University student body members from various
schools and disciplines. More than 80,000 people showed up to the spring commencement ceremony at Michigan stadium this past Sat-
urday.

"It was the perfect ending to col-
lege to have him come," LSA gradu-
ate Adva Gadoth said.
School of Nursing master's gradu-
ate Danyiele Glenn said hearing
Obama speak at her graduation was
"great."
"He's always such an eloquent
speaker," she said. "Just right on time
with his message, and it was just his-
tory."
Business graduate Jacquitta Wat-
son said she thought it was "really
refreshing to have a really empower-
ing speaker" like Obama, adding that
she enjoyed the message of the stu-
dent speaker Alex Marston.
"(Marston's) message about
change and how we need to embrace
it really resonates with me," she said.
"Especially seeing how our football
team is and seeing how our economy
is, everything is going on right now
changing and really hard to adjust to
it and really talking about that really
resonated with me."
Though most of the excitement of
the day surrounded Obama, School
of Music, Theatre & Dance graduate
Mary Martin had other things on
her mind leading up to the ceremo-
ny. Martin, who sang the National
Anthem to open the ceremony, said
standing in front of the crowd at
the Big House was the "scariest and

most humbling" experience of her
life.
"It was just incredible and I've
never had anything like it," she said.
"Now every crowd next to that is
going to seem super small."
LSA graduate Meghan Gallagher
said sitting on the field and watch-
ing Obama flanked by Granholm and
University President Mary Sue Cole-
man was a wonderful way to end her
college career.

the University could be compro-
mised if it is seen that advertise-
ments on the Google e-mail server
are allowed in exchange for cutting
costs.
Rachel Goldman, SACUA member
and engineering professor, said she
was concerned about the closure of
the North Campus Recreation Build-
ing on the weekends during the sum-
mer. She said the limited working
hours could reduce the number of
participants in the MHealthy cam-
paign - a University program com-
mitted to health and well-being.
"Shutting it down for the weekend is
asteptogettingridofit," Goldmansaid.

"It was great because here we have
this wonderful African American
president and then the president of
our university and the governor of
our state are both females, so it's just
a really great picture for me, of what
our future can bring," she said.
- Daily News Editors Nicole Aber,
Stephanie Steinberg and Eshwar
Thirunavukkarasu contributed to
this report.
Goldman also brought up the issue
of the inaccessibility of whiteboards
and chalkboards to professors or fac-
ulty who are unable to reach them
because "they aren't six feet tall."
Gina Poe, recently elected vice
chair of the committee and assis-
tant professor of anesthesiology and
molecular and integrative physiol-
ogy, added that members of the Uni-
versity community are discouraged
from attending meetings or going to
class if they cannot fit into standard-
size chairs in the building.
Members at the meeting also voted
to establish proxy voting, either
through another person or through
e-mails, for members who are unable
to attend. The subject was brought
up by a member who was unable to
attend the remainder of the meeting.

is most to blame for the slowdown.

radio-ready as it is, B.o.B. Presents:
The Adventures ofBobby Ray isn't as
fresh as fans would hope.
In the world of up-and-coming
rappers, B.o.B. (offstage, Bobby Ray

cally wedged himself in
between the ultra-cool
"hipster hop" coming
from the likes of Kid
Cudi and Wale, and
the poppier, dan-

style stuff.
The former
comparison is
most obvious on
the track "The Kids."
This funkier rehash-
ing of the Vampire
Weekend song "The
COURTESY OF B.O.B

Kids Don't Stand A Chance" trades
in the baroque arpeggios and sweep-
ing strings of the original for a less
pretentious bare-bones bassline and
electric guitar accompaniment. But
at the same time, B.o.B. keeps the
upbeat tune and melancholy lines
that made Vampire Weekend's ver-
sion so lovable in the first place.
If Cudi could chill with indie-
boppers MGMT and Ratatat on
his single "Pursuit of Happiness,"
and Wale could remix Justice's
"D.A.N.C.E.," then why shouldn't
B.o.B. take a Vampire Weekend sin-
gle on a toe-tapping and lyrical ride
through his own childhood?
B.o.B. presents:

Besides "The Kids," the thick
production and super-prominent
keyboards on opener "Don't Let Me
Fall," as well as the delicate rising
and fallingsynths that back the lyric
rumination "Ghost in the Machine,"
recall intellectual hipster rap. But
B.o.B. doesn't quite fit into that
scene. Put simply, he just doesn't
have the nerd cred of Kid Cudi or
Wale.
For one thing, B.o.B.'s lyrics are
rarely clever, relevant or unexpect-

well-meaning parent encouraging
safety and moderation ("The kids are

shows," in "Barely Breathing").
Finn also opts more for a love out
of convenience than one of passion
("You won't get every girl /You'll love
the ones you get the best," in "Soft in
the Center"), and he seems to have
eschewed his uncanny ability to make
partying sound creative and intel-
lectual ("Tonight we're gonna have
a really good time / But I want to go
to heaven on the day I die," in "Our
Whole Lives").

return to the painfully raw, authen-
tic delivery of that seminal record.
Instead, this new disc is an exercise
in alt-rock slickness, with skin-tight
harmonies dressed to the nines in
reverb and the drums and power-
chord riffing trotted like debutantes
to the extreme front of the mix.
In fairness, there are a few genu-
ine Hold Steady classics that manage
to survive the record's overabundant
flaws and keep it a worthwhile part
of the band's catalogue. "We Can Get
Together," the set's emotional cen-
terpiece, is a majestic drifter drip-
ping with melody, heartache and
rock'n'roll name-checking, while
understated opener "The Sweet Part
of the City" eases in with leisurely

acoustic swagger that shoots straight
at back-porch nostalgics.
In that same quote about "Soph-
omore Slump," Finn rejects the
notion that talent is a fleeting gift
that an artist can wake up one day
having lost. Instead, Finn subscribes
to the belief that artists should cre-
ate for themselves rather than risk
boredom by pandering to their fans.
Considering how fan-friendly The
Hold Steady has consistently been
- "We were bored so we started
a band / We'd like to play for you,"
Finn reminds us on "The Sweet Part
of the City" - the band deserves the
space to make the album it wants,
fan pressures be damned. But while
eager Hold Steady devotees will
consume Heaven is Whenever like
a drug when it hits their speakers,
when the dust settles they'll still be
reaching for Separation Sunday and
Boys and Girls in America.
Tracks "Fame" and "Love-
lier Than You" take on well-worn
themes that can be guessed from
their titles, and B.o.B.'s lyrics don't
shed any new light. So what's left?
Well, the melodies on both are
damn catchy. It's hard not to chime
in with the brass-heavy "Hey hey
do you wanna be famous?" chorus
of "Fame," and the poetic cliches of
"Lovelier Than You" are delivered
with such an earnest sweetness
that it somehow works. And B.o.B.
can actually sing when he wants to,
always a treat in hip-hop music.
So does B.o.B. do "hip pop" or
"hipster hop?" Bobby Ray can't seem
to pick one path. But if its indecisive
tracklist proves one thing, it's this:
Maybe B.o.B. isn't the smartest or
most original artist out there. But
he doesn't take himself too seri-
ously, and he knows how to have
fun. Bobby Ray, despite its faults, is
a good time - and really, that's why
we're listening.

'When You're Strange'
is factual and pretty,
but it's nothing new
By ANKUR SOHONI
For the Daily
Sometime in the late 1960s, on an
acid trip amongst fellow liberated
youth, you gather to watch a raw,
rough rock act
unfold. Rather ***
than a concert,
though, this is the When You're
scene set by Tom Stra
DiCillo's docu- nge
mentary "When At the Michigan
You're Strange," Abramorama
about the Doors
and the genius
craze feeding lead singer Jim Mor-
rison. The film recounts the career of
the band behind hit songs like "Light
My Fire," "Touch Me" and "Riders on
the Storm," fromits precipitous rise to
fame with its self-titled 1967 debut to
Morrison's mysterious death in July
1971.
Gathering together unseen foot-
age of live performances with now-
legendary images of the rock group,
it serves as a fierce and honest pre-
sentation of the Doors's highest and
lowest days as a band, garnering the
label of "the true story of the Doors"
from keyboardist Ray Manzarek in a
2009 Billboard interview. In opposi-
tion to Oliver Stone's 1991 biopic "The
Doors," "When You're Strange" lays
claim to true events in the band's
history. It is a haunting exercise in
the stranger-than-fiction nature that
reality can have.

Tightly cut under narration by
Johnny Depp, the film uses as its
backbone a slow-paced, continuous
sequence of Morrison riding down a
highway underneath breakneck-pace
musical montage. It portrays the cul-
tural effect of the Doors's music as
arresting and overwhelming, carry-
ing the youthful spirit of the period
into a sharp, almost unbearable cre-
scendo before falling back to reality.
The concert and band footage is
revealing and almost surreal to watch
- it's both counterpoint to and evi-
dence of Morrison's legendary rebel
reputation. As the life force behind
the band's music, Morrison is depict-
ed as both the innocent, roman-
tic poet looking for enlightenment
through LSD use and the frenzied
ringleader of the band's circus-like
performances. A case in point is foot-
age of the infamous 1969 Miami per-
formance that landed Morrison with
six charges, including indecent expo-
sure and public intoxication.
Throughout the arc of the film,
Morrison's multiple personalities
slowly collapse into one indistin-
guishable identity. Against the for-
eign and domestic violence of '60s
America, as well as the abrupt deaths
of fellow musicians Jimi Hendrix
and Janis Joplin, Morrison turns to
drugs and alcohol and a feeling of
despondence as he brings the band
down with him. Confronted by a ris-
ing tide of conservatism in the U.S.,
the Doors persisted together for six
years, recording six albums before
Morrison's death.
While an amalgamation of strange
and fascinating images, the film
offers little in the way of a new nar-
rative for the Doors. Carried for 90

minutes at a rapid pace, the story of
the Doors's career feels unnaturally
compressed. tn pursuing factual
detail, DiCillo abbreviates moments
in the band's career that ought to be
explored. He differentiates his film
from Stone's "The Doors" - which
incurred criticism from bandmem-
bers for taking liberties in its portray-
al - by affirming the truth about the
band, but nonetheless fails to delve
into previously neglected moments
within its history.
Part of this is manifested through
the film's focus on Morrison. The
continuous insistence on Morrison's
prominence becomes repetitive and
frustrating as the other three members
are quickly pushed to the background.
Morrison's unique genius positions
him as protagonist of the Doors's
career, which seems to end with his
death in 1971. DiCillo ignores the two
forgotten years from 1971 to 1973, dur-
ing which the remaining members
recorded two additional albums.
While the film is only visually
revealing, it seems to appropriately
fulfill its purpose. Walking away
from "When You're Strange" is much
like walking away from an engrossing
rock concert, leaving each spectator
with the same yearning for the music.
The film is more musical than cine-
matic, and puts the viewer in the seat
of a participant rather than that of a
witness. Forty years after the Doors's
career, the poetry and intensity of its
live performances are still relevant,
and "When You're Strange" takes
viewers back to its heyday with new
vigor and an honest outlook. Even if
only for the fresh images of the band,
DiCillo's documentary is a worth-
while and spirited trip.

where that your iPod goes" is about
as creative as he gets on "Don't Let
Me Fall."
What's more, guest spots from
Rivers Cuomo on the track "Magic"
and Paramore's Hayley Williams on
"Airplanes" are dated and just plain
uncool, respectively. Cuomo brings
to his collaboration a too-frantic alt-
rock vibe that had the world tired
and bored by the turn of the mil-
lennium. And although Williams is
clearly doing her rock-chick darnd-
est to sound edgy on "Airplanes,"
she still comes off like an unreason-
ably angsty teen girl.
What saves Bobby Ray is actually
its Roth-like simplicity. If the album
isn't quite smart and timely enough
to be hip, at least it's almost catchy
enough to be pop.

Larkin honored during Blue's
series win over rival Ohio State

Michigan tested by UK,
wins weekend series

Wolverines take two of
three from Buckeyes
to claim a tie for first
place in the Big Ten
By: CAITLIN SMITH
Daily Sports Writer
With two Buckeyes on base, another
at-bat and only one out, junior right-
hander Tyler Burgoon knew he needed
to make the upcoming pitch the final
one of the game.
Ohio State had climbed back from a
four-run deficit against the Michigan
baseball team and brought the series-
clinchinggame towithinone in the top
of the eighth inning. Before throwing
the pitch, Burgoon was focusing on one
thing.
"Getting the ground ball," Burgoon
said. "I mean, (Ohio State Ryan Dew
is) not the best runner in the world,
and with our middle infield, we'll eas-
ily turn a double play. We've done it
all week and throughout the year and
I have so much confidence that we can
get that job done."
And the Wolverines delivered on
Burgoon's guarantee to secure a 6-5
win and claim the weekend series.
Freshman shortstop Derek Den-
nis gathered the ground ball, sprinted
across second base and threw the ball
to senior first baseman Mike Dufek for
the double play.
The weekend started off with a
freak injury to the Buckeyes two-year
ace pitcher Alex Wimmers. Wimmers
is one of the best pitchers in the Big Ten
this season with a 9-0 record, which
included a 1.6 ERA and 78 strikeouts in
67 innings pitched.
Wimmers was named an 2009 All-
American and Big Ten co-Pitcher of
the Year in 2009 and has continued
to live up to his reputation this sea-
son. But after reportedly tweaking his

with two consecutive doubles.

Dufek led the offensive effort with
a double down the right baseline that
brought in senior catcher Chris Berset.
Then, redshirt senior right fielder Nick
Urban followed suit with a double to
the opposite corner that drove in two
RBI.
As a result of strong pitching per-
formances by senior left-hander Eric
Katzman, redshirt junior Matt Gerbe,
and Burgoon, this three-run rally
proved to be the deciding factor in the
4-1 Michigan win.
The Buckeyes were unable to pro-
duce at the plate, going only 1-14 with
runners on base, while the Wolverines
pitched a combined one run and seven-
strikeout affair.
But on Saturday, the bats swung the
opposite way. With former shortstop

For the first month of conference
play, the No. 2 Michigan softball
team pummeled the dregs of the Big
Ten. But now the Wolverines are
finding themselves in some of the
most competitive matchups theey
have had all season, including their
two-game series against Kentucky
this past weekend
Though Michigan's struggles in
both games were different in char-
acter, the solutionto those struggles
remained the same - timely clutch
hitting, propelling the Wolverines
to a pair of wins, 5-4 on Friday and
8-4 on Saturday.
In the first game, those timely
plays surfaced in the bottom of the
sixth inning as Michigan (40-6
overall) trailed.
Sophomore outfielder Bree
Evans led off, garnering Michigan's
first run of the game on a disputed
play at home. Evans was originally
declared out, but the call was over-
turned when the third baseman
was called for base-path obstruc-
tion. The play was officially scored
as a triple with an error on the third
baseman leading to the score.
"I was a little hesitant to bring
her to third, even though I thought
she had a shot at it because you
don't want to make an out at third
base and ruin your inning," Michi-
gan coach Carol Hutchins said.
"That was big, because for her to
be out on that play, that inning
would not have happened."
From there, momentum car-
ried the team forward as part of
a four-hit,'five-run inning. Senior
third baseman Maggie Viefhaus
reached base on a double while
senior catcher Roya St. Clair nailed
a home run underneath the score-
board in left field.
The inning was capped off by
senior pitcher Nikki Nemitz's dou-
ble, driving in the game's tying and
winning runs
Up until the sixth inning, Mich-
igan hitters had been stagnant at
the plate. The Wildcats had built
their 4-0 lead as the Wolverines
managed just one hit - also from
Evans, in the second inning - and
reached base on balls just twice
otherwise.
"I told them before the sixth
inning ... it doesn't matter if they
get 100 runs - we don't have any,"
Hutchins said. "I got on them
sharply and told them they need
to have better one-pitch focus. We

need to make her put the ball to the
plate."
The momentum from Friday's
game at the plate carried into the
next day against the Wildcats (29-
23).
Clearly, with 12 hits overall and
at least one hit in every inning but
the first, getting consistent pro-
duction at the plate didn't plague
Michigan in the second game.
But making timely plays as
part of an explosive sixth inning
remained one constant for the
Wolverines.
Michigan went into the bottom
of the sixth inning down 4-3, need-
ing to turn some of the hitting pro-
duction at the plate into runs.
And on the very first pitch of
the inning, Nemitz came through
once again, this time with a homer
rocked into the top row of the
right-field bleachers.
"I'm a pitcher, so when I'm bat-
ting I think like a pitcher," Nemitz
said. "I knew she was throwing
that curve ball in on me, either the
first or second pitch, soI was actu-
ally sitting on it. And it was the
first, so I hit the first one - I was
waiting for it."
Junior outfielder Marley Pow-
ers came to bat immediately fol-
lowing Nemitz. The Owosso native
received just her third start of the
year as the designated player, and
in the fourth inning, Powers had a
home run of her own. In the sixth,
she continued to spark the offense
with a double.
Nemitz's abilities at the plate,
along with her start at the mound,
allowed Hutchins to slide Powers
into the eight spot in the lineup.
"That was apparently brilliant,"
Hutchins joked, referencing the
lineup change.
Though the five-hit, five-run
sixth inning gave the Wolverines a
comfortable lead heading into the
final inning, the game was hardly a
comfortable win.
The series sweep against Ken-
tucky represents the second series
in a row where the Wolverines
have played in tough games, a
significant change from the whip-
pings they've put on sub-par Big
Ten and Mid-American Confer-
ence opponents the last month of
the season.
"You don't ever want to get too
high after a win, or too low after a
loss - you don't want to be on an
emotional roller coaster," Hutchins
said. "Some days you have to grind
and that's what we've been doing."

Wolverines lose in Big Ten Tourney finale

BY: MATT KRASNOFF
Daily Sports Writer
It's been a storybook season for the
Michigan women's tennis team this
year, but after going undefeated in the
Big Ten in the regular season, the Wol-
verines fell just a little short in the con-
ference tournament.
No. 4 Michigan took its 14-match
winningstreakon the road to Iowa City

to face off in the Big Ten Champion-
ships, and after ending Northwestern's
11-year reign as conference champi-
ons, the Wolverines were awarded the
number one seed for the tournament.
As the top seed, Michigan received
a bye in the first round, where it faced
Wisconsin in the quarterfinals, and
walked away a 4-1 winner.
On Saturday, the Wolverines found
themselves facing host team, Iowa, in

the semifinals.
The Iowa match marked just the sec-
ond time this season that Michigan lost
the doubles point. And while going into
singles down one point is certainly a
disadvantage, the team viewed it as an
opportunity to challenge themselves.
"We haven't been in that position for
a while," Bernstein said. "We had our
backs against the wall, so it was either

learning experience; it's good for
us. We had some pressure on us and
it was good to see that they could
come through."
But the Hawkeyes' home-court
advantage wasn't enough to stop
the surging Michigan squad.
"(Iowa) had a good crowd (Satur-
day)," Michigan coach Ronni Bern-
stein said. "But we're going to have
to win on the road if we want to do
well in the postseason. So while it
was tough, it was good to see that
we can do it away from the Varsity
Tennis Center, too."
That win would be the end of
the road for Michigan's weekend.
On Sunday, they ran into a North-
western team that was hungry for
revenge.
Earlier in the season, the Wolver-
ines handed the Wildcats their first
conference loss since 2006. It was
clear that No. 5 Northwestern came
to Iowa with a purpose.
The two teams had met in the
tournament final in each of the past
six seasons, and Northwestern was
crowned tournament champions
each of those years.
"We didn't play our best and
Northwestern played really well,"
Bernstein said. "We're disappoint-
ed, but we're going to go back to the
drawing board and will be ready to
go in two weeks because we've had
a great season, and we're not ready
to stop."

opposite way. With former shortstop
Barry Larkin and a medley of Michi-
gan baseball alumni in the stands to
honor the retirement of Larkin's jer-
sey, the Wolverines were unable to
seal the win.
"It's definitely disappointing (to
lose), especially on a day when we
are retiring Barry Larkin's jersey,"
junior leftfielder Ryan LaMarre said.
"But I mean, we fought. We battled."
A double in the bottom of the
eighth by LaMarre tied up the game
as redshirt junior second baseman
Anthony Toth came sprinting across
home plate.
As the score evened out to 2-2, the
Wolverines had a chance at a come-
back win.
But the late run was for naught as

loss in the finals, there are definite
bright spots for the program this
weekend. Bernstein was named
the conference's Coach of the Year,
while junior Denise Muresan was
named Player of the Year.
Along with Muresan, the team
had two more players on the All-Big
Ten team.
Freshman phenom Mimi Nguy-
en - who was undefeated in
singles during conference play -
took home Freshman of the Year
honors, and junior captain Whit-
ney Taney also made the distin-
guished team.
It was Taney's second time on
the prestigious list, but in her usual
fashion, she immediately deflected
all the glory to her team and team-
mates.
"Mimi and Denise deserve it 100
percent," Taney said. "They're so
well deserving of the awards, and
I'm just so proud of them.
"They've done so much to
deserve it so it's awesome for them
and it's awesome for the program. It
just goes to show how well Michi-
gan has done."
The Wolverines' fate is now out
of their hands.
The NCAA Tournament selec-
tion will 'take place on Tuesday,
when Michigan - who will most
likely remain a top-five team - will
be hoping to host regional action for
the tournament, which begins Fri-
day, May 14.
"Our mentality is going to be to
do what we do," Taney said. "We
know what Michigan can do and
what Michigan's game is, so we
need to go out there and go for it and
do it together as a team."
the Wolverines won by that one-run
margin, which could prove to be a
huge 'W'.
Friday night's offensive duo was
back in action as Dufek and Urban
both launched a home run out of Ray
Fisher Stadium.
"I felt a lot better at the plate this
weekend," Urban said. "I felt more
comfortable and that I was seeing
the ball better and it paid off."
Michigan also played solid
defense, producing only one error on
the weekend.
Although a number of pitchers
contributed to the series win, Bur-

out all three games.
"What a job again by Tyler Bur-
goon," Michigan coach Rich Malo-
ney said. "I mean, pitching three
straight days - that's just willpower.
It's a tough spot to be in and to be
able to get the double play when it's
all on the line; he was just pitching
with heart.
"That's what your closer needs to
do."

And some Wolverines celebrated
more than just a NCAA Tourna-

siers. Robertson wasn't the only

this season. Anderson was awarded

its hot streak on a much larger scale
starting May 14 in San Diego, where
the Wolverines will face the best in

NCAA Tournament Championship.
"To do three in a row is harder
than to win it the first time or the
second time," Anderson said. "After
last year, losing seven of our top 16
and losing roughly four starters,
people didn't expect this to happen.
But we felt as a program that we
could do it. ... It made it very satis-
fying for the team to complete the
three-peat."
