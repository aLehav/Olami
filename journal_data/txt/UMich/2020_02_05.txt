A report from the Public 
Accountability 
Initiative 
has 
connected the University of 
Michigan to private equity fund 
Lime 
Rock 
Partners, 
which 
directly 
finances 
billionaire 
Texas 
oil-driver 
Tim 
Dunn 
and a far-right political action 
committee 
called 
Empower 
Texans.
With the growing traction 
of the fossil fuel divestment 

movement 
on 
campus 
and 
greater emphasis on responsible 
investment, 
groups 
within 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
community feel more empowered 
to 
demand 
responsible 
investment that aligns with 
commonly-held 
values 
on 
campus. 
Simultaneously, 
University officials have weighed 
distancing investments from the 
public eye.
In late September, the Public 
Accountability 
Initiative 
released a report showing that 

$26 million of the University 
endowment was invested in 
private equity fund Lime Rock 
Partners as of October 2018. 
The fund finances Dunn and 
Empower Texans, a conservative 
group that has a major role in 
supporting far-right rhetoric and 
legislation in Texas politics.
Climate activists on campus 
have rebuked the investment.
Law student Nash Hall, a 
member 
of 
Climate 
Action 
Movement, said the University’s 
financial support of political 

organizations such as Empower 
Texans stands against the values 
of the University and democracy 
in general.
“It’s important to recognize 
when 
you’re 
talking 
about 
electoral politics that the same 
organizations or the same people 
who are pouring money into the 
Empower Texans organization 
are 
also 
affirmatively 
anti-
democracy in their views,” Hall 
said. 

Fifteen 
University 
of 
Michigan and Ann Arbor 
environmental and political 
advocacy groups attended 
the 
Campus 
Carbon 
Neutrality 
Communication 
and Culture Town Hall on 
Tuesday evening to discuss 
options for improving the 
University’s 
sustainability 
efforts. 
Approximately 
25 

people attended the town 
hall in West Hall.
The 
President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon 
Neutrality led the event. 
Joseph 
Trumpey, 
Art 
& 
Design associate professor, 
the host of the town hall, said 
its purpose was to focus on 
how student organizations 
cancan help achieve carbon 
neutrality 
within 
their 
own groups, but also across 
campus. 
“I think the main question 

here is, ‘What is the culture 
of 
U-M, 
the 
institution? 
How does it relate to student 
organizations and student 
life on campus, and what can 
be improved to make carbon 
neutrality a mission that 
you feel is shared, that the 
University is supporting you, 
and you’re supporting the 
University, and everything 
moves forward?’” Trumpey 
said.
The 
PCCN 
highlighted 
some 
of 
its 
own 

recommendations 
for 
the 
University. Trumpey said the 
group is encouraging fossil 
fuel divestment options for 
faculty and staff, as well as 
an institution-wide three-
credit 
educational 
and 
training 
requirement 
on 
the 
environment, 
among 
other suggestions. He said a 
preliminary step in spreading 
educational awareness would 
be continuing Planet Blue, 
Anne Curzan, the University 
of Michigan Literature, Science 
and the Arts dean, spoke 
about the value of a liberal 
arts education to a crowd of 
approximately 
100 
people 
Tuesday afternoon in Keene 
Theater. The speech was part 
of the The Residential College’s 
annual Robertson Lecture.
Curzan said she is constantly 
fascinated by the breadth of 
subjects students can explore 
in LSA and expressed her 
love for learning, especially 
about languages. She served 
as the Geneva Smitherman 
Collegiate Professor of English, 
Linguistics 
and 
Education 
prior to her appointment as 
dean.
“I went to college, and 
I 
didn’t 
even 
know 
what 
linguistics was,” Curzan said. 
“How I’ve got from there, 
from going to college as a math 
major to becoming a linguistics 
major, is through a liberal arts 
degree.”
When 
discussing 
the 
importance 
of 
exploration, 
Curzan 
noted 
the 
social 
pressure that forces people to 
act as if they always know the 
answer to every question asked 
of them. 

In response to the rising cost 
of exercise classes in Ann Arbor, 
the University of Michigan’s 
Central Student Government 
launched 
a 
program 
in 
conjunction 
with 
Michigan 
Recreational 
Sports 
last 
semester to eliminate barriers 
to physical and social wellness 
for 
low-income 
students. 
CSG received more than 140 
applications for the 75 passes for 
the winter semester. 
In August, Central Student 
Government began subsidizing 
Group X passes for Pell Grant-
eligible students. Last semester, 
CSG received 40 applications for 
the 75 available passes in fall.
Group 
X 
passes 
provide 
students access to all fitness 
classes on campus, totaling more 
than 100 classes per week. The 
group classes range include 
cycling, yoga and zumba. 
CSG President Ben Gerstein, 
Public 
Policy 
junior, 
said 
when a member of the CSG 
Affordability 
Task 
Force 
and a member of Affordable 
Michigan recommended that 
CSG subsidize Group X passes, 
he integrated the policy into his 
campaign platform. 

In her response to President 
Donald Trump’s State of the 
Union address, Michigan Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer emphasized 
civic 
engagement 
and 
her 
commitment to a hopeful future 
for America.
“We and all Americans might 
be weary of today’s politics, 
but we must stay engaged,” 
Whitmer said. “Our country, 
our democracy, our future 
demand it. We’re capable of 
great things when we work 
together.” 
Whitmer gave the speech 
on Tuesday evening at her 
daughters’ school, East Lansing 
High School. Generally, the 
Democrat’s rebuttal has been 
given by rising politicians in 
the Democratic party, allowing 
them to present their opposition 
in front of the nation.
In a press release, Senate 
minority 
leader 
Chuck 

Schumer, D-NY, spoke about 
the 
various 
reasons 
for 
choosing Whitmer to give the 
speech. 
“Governor 
Whitmer’s 
dedication 
to 
Michiganders 
is a model for public servants 
everywhere,” Schumer said in 
the press release. “Whether 
it’s pledging to ‘Fix the Damn 
Roads’ or investing in climate 
solutions, Governor Whitmer’s 
vision for the future is exactly 
what this country needs, and 
I’m thrilled she is giving the 
Democratic response.”
Michigan, 
Whitmer’s 
home state, is also considered 
a 
key 
battleground 
state 
in 
the 
upcoming 
2020 
election. Whitmer won her 
gubernatorial race by 10 points 
over former Republican State 
Attorney General Bill Schuette 
in 2018, two years after Trump 
won the state by a slight margin 
over 
Democratic 
candidate 
Hillary Clinton.

The University of Michigan 
Central Student Government 
met 
in 
Pierpont 
Commons 
Tuesday 
night 
to 
appoint 
new 
representatives, 
discuss 
executive 
projects 
regarding 
mental 
health 
and student accessibility to 
campus resources, as well as 
accommodations 
for 
student 
absences on election days.
Kate Stenvig voiced concerns 
regarding deportations to Iraq 
during the community concerns 
portion of the meeting. She 
highlighted the urgency of CSG 
passing a resolution to mandate 
the 
University 
boycott 
its 
partnership with Delta Airlines 
in order to prevent deportation 
flights. 
Stenvig 
also 
spoke 
about 
the deportation case of Oliver 
Awshana, who came to the U.S. 
as a teenage refugee. When 
immigration officials tried to 
deport him over the summer, 
the pilot refused to fly the 
plane. Awshana pleaded his case 
again, though he was directed 
to be deported again. Awshana 
lost the lawsuit, which Stenvig 
said she sees as a sign of what 
the Senate is planning to do 
in regard to President Donald 
Trump’s impeachment.
“We just got the decision 
today, and what that tells us is 
that the judge was waiting to 

see what happened with the 
situation with Trump,” Stenvig 
said. “And it’s clear that what’s 
going to happen is that the 
Senate is going to acquit him 
and that he was going to get 
away with everything.”
Medical 
student 
Solomon 
Rajput, a Democrat running 
for U.S. Congress in the 12th 
District 
against 
incumbent 
Debbie Dingell, updated the 
Assembly on the progress of his 
campaign and his reasons for 
running.
“I feel like we are on the 
cusp of a huge moment in this 
country, where if we don’t mess 
up we could really address some 
of these human rights issues,” 
Rajput said. “At this point, it is 
clear to the American people 
that we can’t just abandon our 
political systems and expect 
there to be change. We need to 
go out there and fight for world 
policies that will solve problems 
at a fundamental level.”
CSG President Ben Gerstein, 
Public Policy junior, gave the 
biannual State of the Students 
report, informing the Assembly 
of the University’s Board of 
Regents’ creation of a $9.19 
semesterly student fee to fund 
CSG. He noted students with 
certain financial aid packages 
would be exempt from these fees. 
Gerstein also notified the 
Assembly of the progress of 
the Affordability Task Force’s 
five-year plan and their success 
in increasing advertising for 

the Maize and Blue Cupboard, 
creating a microwave map and 
installing microwaves at campus 
cafes. He also mentioned the 
task force’s future plans of 
establishing how the housing 
cost of attendance is calculated 
and linking it to off-campus 
market situations.
Gerstein also spoke about 
CSG 
initiatives 
to 
increase 
accessibility and affordability 
for students such as discounted 
meal 
plans 
for 
off-campus 
students, funding microwaves 
in the Shapiro Library and the 
Michigan League and increasing 
MCard swiping hours.
His address highlighted CSG’s 
plans to provide students with a 
platform to acquire iClickers, 
calculators and textbooks as 
opposed to relying on Facebook. 
Gerstein spoke about CSG’s 
agenda to create a guide for 
mental health services available 
on campus, creating a fund for 
the Spectrum Center to support 
the LGBTQ+ community and 
plans to increase the hours of 
the Oxford Housing shuttle to 
better accommodate students’ 
needs.
Gerstein discussed ongoing 
efforts to improve students’ 
lives.
“I 
am 
currently 
working 
with President Schlissel and a 
students’ round table to figure 
out better ways to enhance 
student well-being on campus,” 
Gerstein said. 
The Assembly used a secret 

ballot to elect the Chair of the 
Communications 
Committee. 
Out of the two nominees, LSA 
representatives Drishaan Jain 
and Sam Burnstein, Jain was 
elected. 
Additionally, the Assembly 
unanimously recalled Business 
representatives Jonah Cuenca 
and Mohamed Omran because 
of their excessive absences.
The Assembly also passed a 
resolution to support excused 
absences 
on 
election 
days 
and urge professors to amend 
syllabi to provide reasonable 
accommodations 
to 
students 
who do not attend class on 
election 
day 
provided 
that 
attendance in the course would 
restrict students’ participation 
in civic affairs. 
Following a debate regarding 
CSG 
attendance, 
Treasurer 
Taylor Lansey, LSA junior, said 
it was important for committee 
members to be respectful of one 
another.
“We all have opinions here 
— opinions that matter — and 
other people also have the 
right to voice their opinions 
and be respected when they do 
so,” Lansey said. “I think that a 
lot of people might appreciate 
speaking a cordial tone. I think it 
might be beneficial for all of us to 
be a little bit, for lack of a better 
term, nicer to one another.”

Feb. 5, 1970: Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs 
hits Students for a Democratic Society’s disruptive actions

The 
Senate 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs (SACUA) yesterday 
condemned recent vandalism 
at the University and said 
it would not hesitate to 
recommend 
strengthening 
University 
disciplinary 
procedures if the present 
ones prove inadequate.
The statement approved 
unanimously at a special 
meeting 
of 
the 
faculty 
executive 
committee, 
came just one day after 
President Robben Fleming 

announced 
a 
three-point 
disciplinary 
program 
aimed at persons involved 
in 
recent 
disruptions 
at 
the 
University. 
SACUA’s 
statement 
expressed 
a 
concern about “the recent 
series of events involving 
violent tactics by a few 
persons at the University.” 
In an apparent expression of 
concern with the harassment 
of corporation and military 
recruiters over the last two 
weeks. The release called on 
the University community 

to 
reaffirm 
support 
and 
enforcement of the principle 
of academic freedom.
The special session was 
called by SACUA Chairman 
Joseph 
Payne, 
who 
said 
the group was concerned 
about the recent vandalism 
at 
North 
Hall 
and 
SDS 
demonstrations against the 
recruiters.
The three-point SACUA 
statement first calls upon “all 
elements in the University 
community to reaffirm and 
maintain their support of the 

principle that the campus 
must be a free market place 
of ideas.”
It further asks that the 
“University resist the efforts 
of all outside and inside 
forces that would restrict 
its freedom, let alone the 
civil liberties of some of its 
members.”
The 
second 
section 
is 
concerned with the “Strain on 
the disciplinary and judicial 
processes of the University” 
created by disturbances. The 
statement said SACUA would 

recommend new University 
judicial 
institutions 
if 
the 
present 
ones 
prove 
inadequate.
“No 
specific 
proposals 
were discussed,” said history 
Prof. 
Gerhard 
Weinberg. 
“Just the feeling that the 
existing 
procedures 
will 
obviously be put to a severe 
test.”
“Those 
interested 
in 
maintaining 
a 
free 
University 
are 
concerned 
about seeing whether the 
existing 
institutions 
can 

hold up,” he added.
The 
last 
section 
of 
the 
SACUA 
statement 
condemned the vandalism 
because of the expense it 
causes the University.
The 
statement 
charged 
that vandalism takes funds 
urgently needed “for the 
support of larger numbers of 
students from disadvantaged 
sectors of the population.” 
The 
statement 
concludes 
by suggesting a “reordering 
of priorities right here and 
now.”

CORRECTION: In yesterday’s issue of The Michigan Daily, a graphic on Page 2 incorrectly stated that Rosa Park’s birthday was Feb. 13, 1913. Her birthday is Feb. 4, 1913.

a 
University 
sustainability 
initiative.
“We’re 
looking 
at 
a 
spectrum of reinforcing the 
Planet Blue online system, 
as kind of the shallow end 
of the pool, to the deep end 
of the pool, where there’s an 
academic three-credit course 

for every school and college 
which 
would 
be 
difficult 
to implement, but could be 
really pivotal in changing the 
culture of the University,” 
Trumpey said.
Students 
at 
the 
town 
hall noted that it may be 
difficult for the University 
to require students to take 
a three-credit course. As an 
alternative, Rackham student 
Akash Shah, Climate Blue 
member, asked about adding a 

sustainability curriculum into 
the mandatory online modules 
University freshmen have to 
complete on sexual assault 
and alcohol consumption.
Members of the audience 
nodded in response. 
Students focused on the 
positive and negative aspects 
of both the top-down culture 
and the bottom-up culture 
at the University. The main 
issue they uncovered through 
these 
conversations 
was 

a 
lack 
of 
communication 
among 
different 
student 
organizations, 
as 
well 
as a need for expanding 
educational 
efforts 
and 
overcoming 
institutional 
barriers across campus.
Specifically, 
several 
of 
the 
student 
groups 
expressed 
concerns 
about 
the 
administration’s 
sustainability efforts.

Gerstein said he has worked 
with the Dean of Students 
and 
Michigan 
Recreational 
Sports to eliminate barriers to 
physical fitness for students. 
“In working with Financial 
Aid and Rec Sports, we tried 
to create something that made 
sure that access to something 
that’s as important as physical 
fitness 
wasn’t 
privileged 
based 
on 
socioeconomic 
background,” Gerstein said.
CSG has been criticized 
in the past for its actions 
surrounding affordability. In 
2018, the organization released 
a campus affordability guide 
that was deemed “out of touch” 
by students and prompted the 
creation of the crowdsourced 
“Being 
Not-Rich 
at 
U-M” 
guide.
In an email to The Daily, 
Social Work student Laura 
Rall, 
Affordable 
Michigan 
president, 
said 
CSG 
subsidizing the $55 Group X 
pass can mitigate obstacles to 
physical fitness for students 
who need to first pay for food, 
tuition and bills. 
“(Group 
X 
is) 
a 
great 
program, in my experience, but 

the classes often leave out low-
income students because of the 
expense,” Rall wrote. “With 
CSG offering these subsidized 
passes, I feel as though the 
campus is becoming a more 
inclusive and welcoming to 
low-income students.” 
While 
the 
program 
is 
currently only available to 
students who are eligible for 
Pell Grants, Gerstein said he 
recognizes there are other 
groups on campus who still 
find the cost of the Group X 
pass to be prohibitive. 
“I want to look into how 
we can build this model out 
to 
include 
students 
who 
aren’t just necessarily on Pell 
Grants, but on other forms of 
financial aid, and then also to 
make sure we are including 
our undocumented students, 
international 
students 
who don’t have access to 
government financial aid in 
the United States, but still need 
access to these resources,” 
Gerstein said. 
Mental 
health 
poses 
challenges of its own for 
students. Recreational Sports 
Director Mike Widen said 
the 
partnership 
between 
Recreational Sports and CSG 
to subsidize Group X passes 
is a proactive way to help 

students 
improve 
mental 
health 
through 
physical 
activity. 
“I 
would 
imagine 
that 
(students) 
are 
certainly 
thrilled with the ability to get 
a group exercise pass without 
having the barrier of finances 
coming in the way,” Widen 
said. “That allows them to be 
more physically active, allows 
them to connect with other 
students who have a like-
mindedness that, hey, I want 
to be physically active too, and 
that connection can help with 
the social component of the 
model of well-being.” 
Widen touched on another 
component of the program’s 
efforts to be inclusive — the 
passes are no different than 
non-subsidized 
passes 
to 
protect 
the 
confidentiality 
of students. He said he sees 
the program as a partnership 
between 
two 
organizations 
dedicated to improving student 
wellness and accessibility. 
“(The program) has been a 
win-win,” Widen said. “And 
the more access (students) can 
get to more opportunities, I 
think everybody benefits.”

“ … Part of that vision is the 
removal of people’s power, of 
community 
power, 
and 
the 
vesting of it in a very select group 
of very wealthy individuals that 
make the decisions for most 
of our society, and it’s in their 
interest 
when 
communities 
accept that as the status quo, or 
the way it just is.”
In an email to The Daily, 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald said it is not the 
University’s policy to comment 
on its investments.
“It is our normal practice, not 
to comment on the investment 
managers we work with or to 
discuss the university’s strategy 
of 
investments,” 
Fitzgerald 
wrote.
University President Mark 
Schlissel told The Daily in an 
interview last week that political 
ideology does not play a large 
role in the endowment.
“In general, the purpose of 
the endowment is to provide 
support for an area that we’ve 
agreed with a donor is an area 
that the University thinks is 
important and the donor wants 
to support,” Schlissel said. “We 
make a commitment to the donor 
to be a good steward of their 
money. So that means trying to 
generate the right mix of risk and 
return that sort of yield to the 
investment so that in perpetuity, 
we can support the thing that 
we agreed upon — students 
scholarships, for example — and 
have the endowment grow so 
that its value is not eroded with 
inflation through the years.”
Divestment from fossil fuels 
has remained at the forefront 
of 
campus 
discourse. 
Last 
year’s Climate Strike resulted 
in the arrest and subsequent 
court trials of six students. In 
December, the Board of Regents 
voted against a $50 million 
dollar investment in oil and gas 
company 
Vendera 
Resources 
amid pressure from CAM and 
the One University Campaign.
Conversations 
about 
divesting from political issues 
have arisen previously. In 2017, 
student activists pushed for 
the University to divest from 
companies that did business with 
Israel. The activists received 
Central Student Government’s 
support, though the University 
ultimately did not divest.
Activism 
for 
divestment, 
led by organizations such as 
CAM, have taken the form of 
written statements addressed to 
President Schlissel and events 
educating on divestment. In 
January at the Association of 
Big Ten Students Conference, 
student governments of each Big 
Ten school passed a unanimous 
resolution 
demanding 
their 
respective institutions freeze 

fossil fuel investments.
However, the investment in 
question is not only pertinent 
to climate activists. Subsequent 
reports 
showed 
Michigan’s 
$26 
million 
and 
Michigan 
State University’s $15.6 million 
investments 
to 
Lime 
Rock 
Partners 
owned 
by 
private 
equity firm Lime Rock Partners, 
which oversees and finances 
the 
business 
operations 
of 
CrownQuest, an oil drilling 
company owned by Tim Dunn. 
With the money from his oil 
business, Dunn created and 
today bankrolls conservative 
political organization Empower 
Texans, having given over $7.6 
million to the PAC since 2008.
Dunn 
and 
Farris 
Wilks, 
the co-founders of Empower 
Texans, 
have 
pushed 
for 
conservative and evangelical 
causes, such as anti-transgender 
bathroom legislation, opposition 
to marriage equality, blocking 
safe information on abortion 
clinics and supporting efforts 
to disenfranchise naturalized 
citizens under the guise of 
protecting against voter fraud. 
They have donated $250,000 to 
the Trump administration in 
2019. 
LSA junior Isabel Hedin-
Urrutia, 
executive 
board 
member of LGBT Michigan, 
said this investment does not 
surprise her, given that the 
University has made space for 
conservative speakers such as 
Ben Shapiro, who, according to 
Hedin-Urrutia, incite dangerous 
rhetoric. She emphasized the 
ideological differences between 
the University administration 
and the campus community. 
“I’ve done a lot of research, 
and this University has a very 
rich history on queer activism, 
but a lot of the progressive 
activism 
has 
not 
come 
necessarily from the University 
itself, but it’s come from either 
its student body, or it’s come 
from faculty that have come 
from the outside that have 
somehow become involved with 
the University,” Hedin-Urrutia 
said. “I wish I could say I’m 
surprised, but I’m not, because 
money, above all else, seems to 
be a primary concern for a lot of 
people who involve themselves 
in politics.” 
As someone who works to 
pay for her out-of-state tuition, 
Hedin-Urrutia said she sees this 
investment — and the platform 
for conservative speakers — as 
an insult to the work she has put 
in to attend the University and 
create a welcoming, accessible 
environment. 
In 
Hedin-
Urrutia’s 
view, 
endowment 
money should be spent on 
supporting students, such as by 
helping to solve the Ann Arbor 
housing crisis or provide a better 
University healthcare system. 
“They were literally thinking 
about 
cutting 
STD 
testing, 

which none of us have forgotten. 
It’s just insane because they 
said it would cost too much, but 
this is $26 million going to what 
exactly, oil drilling and far-right 
politics?” Hedin-Urrutia said.
LSA junior Solomon Medintz, 
CAM organizer, said there is a 
need for a sustained effort to 
incorporate greater student and 
faculty input on the endowment 
investments. 
He 
criticized 
the way the investment was 
approved.
“This 
decision 
making 
is entirely composed of the 
nine people that make up the 
Regents, the president and the 
chief financial officer,” Medintz 
said. “That’s not the way a public 
institution should be run, and 
we should be incorporating 
more stakeholders.”
Rackham 
student 
Sasha 
Bishop, CAM member, explained 
a key goal of CAM is to promote 
transparency 
of 
University 
investments. Bishop added that 
while the University has to make 
money, bringing in revenue and 
investing responsibly are not 
mutually exclusive, especially 
when investments — like this 
one — can have political and 
social impacts. 
“More and more people are 
questioning 
the 
bottom-line 
motivation of profit, especially 
when a lot of the other arguments 
you hear from the students is 
that profit isn’t actually going 
to directly benefit students and 
community members,” Bishop 
said. “When we see brand new 
buildings being built so that 
someone very wealthy can slap 
their name on it and get that 
honor, but low-income students 
aren’t being supported, and 
people can’t afford to live in 
the town — so basic needs 
aren’t being met — educators, 
instructors 
and 
students 
aren’t being prioritized, that 
motivation of profit dissolves in 
a lot of ways.” 
Similarly, 
Medintz 
noted 
CAM’s work aims to promote 
transparency, but they need 
cooperation from the University 
administration. 
He 
said 
finding information about the 
University’s 
finances 
should 
not be as difficult as it is so the 
public can hold the institution 
accountable.
“It takes a lot of research 
from specific people to find 
this information, and we’re 
grateful that they’re doing that, 
but what we’re asking for is to 
make it a little bit easier so that 
the amount of labor it takes to 
get this information and to try 
to do the work to actually have 
our 
institution 
support 
our 
communities,” Medintz said. 
“People can do that.”

Curzan 
said 
there 
is 
excitement 
in 
discovering 
the answer.
“We need to give more 
credit to the courage it takes 
to say, ‘I don’t know,’” Curzan 
said. “You know, the moment 
I really came to respect you 
was the first time you said, ‘I 
don’t know.’” 
Curzan then contemplated 
the future of undergraduate 
education and how it should 
be designed to reflect real 
goals and aspirations. She 
encouraged 
students 
to 
think about how they can 
contribute to the common 
good through their studies. 
She 
emphasized 
finding 
purpose 
through 
lifelong 
learning 
and 
said 
even 
though 
college 
can 
push 

students to fixate on their 
grades, she hopes this isn’t 
the case for most students. 
Near the end of her speech, 
Curzan 
underscored 
the 
importance 
of 
learning 
outside the classroom by 
sharing with the audience 
her story of teaching English 
in China, a trip she undertook 
despite objections from her 
friends and family.
“It 
fundamentally 
changed who I was as a 
person,” Curzan said. “These 
experiences are what help 
us learn. They are scary. 
Real learning is scary, and 
real learning takes courage, 
because it is going into the 
unknown and exploring the 
unknown.”
After the talk, students 
and faculty headed to a zero-
waste reception organized 
outside the Keene Theatre. 
LSA 
freshman 
Marnie 
Guaman said she was excited 

to hear the dean speak, adding 
that she enjoyed Curzan’s 
story about teaching in the 
Summer 
Bridge 
Scholars 
program.
“She said that her least 
favorite word was impactful, 
but her speech was very 
impactful for me,” Guaman 
said. “I was in the Summer 
Bridge program, so I could go 
back to that experience.” 
LSA senior Mya Harris 
expressed her interest in 
learning about the future of 
liberal arts education.
“I 
really 
found 
her 
background 
interesting, 
how she got to where she 
was and her own experience 
with liberal arts education,” 
Harris said. “I also liked the 
way she talked about the 
future of the University.”

Since 
being 
elected, 
Whitmer has worked across 
the aisle to expand affordable 
health care initiatives, create 
a task force committed to 
improve the state’s drinking 
water and invest billions of 
dollars to rebuild and improve 
Michigan’s infrastructure. 
Whitmer 
opened 
her 
response 
by 
promising 
to 
stay 
focused 
on 
her 
and 
the 
Democratic 
Party’s 
commitment 
to 
issues 
in 
Michigan and the country as a 
whole. 
“After all, you can listen 
to what someone says, but 
to know the truth, watch 
what they do,” Whitmer said. 
“Michiganders are no different 
from Americans everywhere. 
We love our families and want 
a good life today and a better 
life tomorrow for our kids.” 
She shared the story of 
13-year-old 
Monte 
Scott, 
who grew tired of waiting for 
politicians to fix the potholes 
in his Michigan hometown. 
Whitmer said Scott grabbed 
a shovel to fill in the potholes 
himself 
and 
called 
on 
politicians to invest more in 
America’s infrastructure.
She 
next 
talked 
about 
her own troubling personal 
experiences 
with 
the 
U.S. 
health care system. Whitmer 
also 
expressed 
Democrats’ 
commitment 
to 
creating 
a 
stronger and more affordable 
health care system. 
“For 
me, 
for 
so 
many 
Americans, 
health 
care 
is 
personal, 
not 
political,” 
Whitmer said. “I was holding 
down a new job, caring for my 
newborn daughter as well as 
my mom at the end of her brain 
cancer battle. It was hard. It 
exposed the harsh realities 
of our workplaces, our health 
care system, and our child care 
system, and it changed me.”
Whitmer next rebutted a 
claim Trump made during his 

State of the Union address. 
Trump said that the stock 
market has soared more than 70 
percent and gained $12 trillion 
in value during his presidency. 
“This is a record,” Trump 
said. “It is something every 
country in the world is looking 
up to.”
Fact-checkers at The New 
York Times rated the claim 
false, noting that since Trump 
won the presidency in 2016, the 
S&P 500-stock index and the 
Dow Jones industrial average 
were both up by approximately 
60 percent.
Whitmer responded to this in 
her speech by emphasizing how 
much work still has to be done 
to build an economy that works 
for all Americans. 
“It 
doesn’t 
matter 
what 
the president says about the 
stock market,” Whitmer said. 
“What matters is that millions 
of people struggle to get by or 
don’t have enough money at the 
end of the month after paying 
for 
transportation, 
student 
loans or prescription drugs. … 
So, when the president says the 
economy is strong, my question 
is: strong for whom?”
Next, Whitmer talked about 
the improvements in education 
that Democrats from various 
states have made in the last year 
and expressed her confidence 
in the next generation. She 
closed her speech by urging the 
American public to continue to 
pay attention to all the things 
going on in Washington. 
“It’s not what those senators 
say,” Whitmer said. “Tomorrow, 
it’s about what they do that 
matters. Remember, listen to 
what people say but watch what 
they do. It’s time for action. 
Generations of Americans are 
counting on us. Let’s not let 
them down.”
Following 
Whitmer’s 
response, U.S. Rep. Debbie 
Dingell, D-Mich., called for 
legislative action to address 
issues impacting working-class 
Americans on Twitter.
“I am worried about the State 
of our Union,” Dingell wrote. 

“We have to find ways to come 
together for the working men 
and women of this country to 
lower cost of prescription drugs, 
ensure the people who have 
pre-existing conditions have 
access to quality, affordable 
healthcare, that our kids can 
get a good education, and 
people who have worked hard 
for a lifetime are able to have 
a safe and secure retirement. 
Coming off the speech, we can’t 
afford to keep fighting from 
now until November. I hope 
there are areas where we can 
work together for the benefit of 
all Americans.”
Caroline 
Martin, 
member 
of the University’s chapter of 
College Republicans and LSA 
junior, spoke to The Daily about 
her thoughts on Whitmer’s 
response and its similarities to 
the State of the Union. 
“(Whitmer used) the same 
tactic honestly that the State 
of the Union used, which is 
hitting home, individuals and 
the ideas and the concepts of 
the American family,” Martin 
said. “They’re sort of good 
messages that she’s putting 
out and, you know, the idea of 
fixing the roads and improving 
the overall quality of life for 
American families. I just think 
the difference is the two parties 
obviously have differences on 
how to achieve that.” 
LSA 
sophomore 
Regina 
Egan, 
College 
Democrats 
communications 
director, 
praised Whitmer’s speech.
“Governor Whitmer notably 
brought 
national 
attention 
to a critical question facing 
Americans: how well does our 
country’s infrastructure — in 
the form of roads, health care, 
education, etc. — serve the 
majority of Americans?” Egan 
said. “Like Governor Whitmer, 
College Democrats believes in 
a future of this country that 
serves each and every one of its 
constituents.”

LSA senior Kristen Hayden, 
Climate 
Action 
Movement 

member, commented on a lack 
of transparency. 
“Accountability 
and 
transparency 
are 
the 
two 
things 
that 
really 
hurt 
efforts around any student 
organizing,” 
Hayden 
said. 

“Understanding 
how 
the 
University makes its decisions 
and who to contact to get 
things done, and why the 
University 
chooses 
to 
do 
things the way that it does (is 
important).”
These 
discussions 
led 
to 
attendees 
suggesting 
more than 50 new ideas on 
achieving carbon neutrality 
at the University. Hayden 
suggested integrating repair 
thrift shops to provide a 
sustainable 
solution 
for 
damaged items like furniture, 
and Shah encouraged the 
implementation of groceries 
close to campus.
“I find it quite absurd that 
I have to drive my 3,000-
pound car to go get a gallon 
of milk,” Shah said.
Hayden 
explained 
the 
importance of town halls 
like 
these 
in 
changing 
the 
conversation 
on 
sustainability 
and 
carbon 
neutrality at the University. 
She said the school could 
be an influential model for 
other institutions.
“I think something that is 
also important to note about 
the University is that it’s 
a microcosm of the larger 
world 
and 
understanding 
that shifting the systems here 
can help shift the systems in 
the places where U-M has 
influence, 
systems 
being 
things that influence how 
students are recruited, who 
has power here, and how that 
power is used,” Hayden said.

Why civility is critical in election season

O

n Nov. 9, 2016, there 
was a palpable feeling of 
agitation that weighed 
down on the University of 
Michigan’s Ann Arbor campus. 
The iconic rock on Hill Street 
brazenly displayed hate speech; 
the smell of fresh paint hovered 
like 
smog. 
Conservative 
supporters of President Donald 
Trump reported feeling the 
need for “safe spaces” while 
progressive activists were quick 
to express their discontent with 
Trump’s 
regressive 
rhetoric 
when discussing gender and race. 
Our Diag, typically traversed by 
tired students trekking to their 
classes, was overcome with 
vigils, protesters and counter-
protesters and visibly presented 
the overall unrest and division 
that 
underpinned 
the 
2016 
presidential election. In a town 
perceived to be almost entirely 
liberal, the tension was still 
irrepressible. 
While I was not yet on campus 
during the campaign and election 
of Trump, my community felt the 
tension as well. From a majorly 
conservative suburb of Grand 
Rapids, our political voice was 
expected to align with right-
wing policies. Our vote went to 
whichever Republican made it 
past the primaries. Regardless 
of where I was — in church, at 
school or at work — there was a 
feeling of unspoken consensus 
from March until November. 
While professed beliefs ranged 
from supporting Trump as the 
lesser of two evils, the tough 
candidate or the candidate who 
cares about the people, one could 
typically assume their neighbors 
supported him.
A handful of outspoken and 
passionate community members 
would 
voice 
their 
concerns 
about 
Trump’s 
alarming 
rhetoric regarding women and 
minorities. In class, after a 

discussion of populism and fear-
mongering, I raised my hand and 
made the bold assertion Trump 
had utilized those strategies, 
citing 
multiple 
incidents 
of 
racialized fear tactics. Unease 
settled in the room, but no one 
challenged the idea. After class, 
I could hear “build that wall 
Liz, make America great again!” 
echoing down the hallways. 
While there was an opportunity 
for discourse, it was swiftly 
dismissed as divisive and the 
chance 
for 
active 
listening, 
questioning or understanding 
went cold. 
Throughout 
Trump 
and 
Hillary Clinton’s campaigns, 
the most frequently debated 
policy topics were the economy, 
terrorism, 
foreign 
policy, 
health care and guns. With 
increasing economic inequality 
in a vulnerable working and 
middle class, growing unease 
over nuclear warfare and global 
conflict, the stability of access 
to healthcare and the frequent 
news stories of gun violence, 
the 
uniting 
factor 
between 
policies becomes increasingly 
clear: fear. Deliberate tactics 
to garner support are woven 
throughout the rhetoric of both 
Trump’s campaign and tenure 
as president, which Clinton had 
to face and counter until she 
failed to secure enough electoral 
votes. At a time of economic 
uncertainty 
and 
frustration, 
fear of danger (both abroad 
and domestic) and political 
mudslinging, 
biases 
and 
identity-based insults stoked 
the flame of anger and fear. 
Independently, 
as 
people 
living in this country, we cannot 
control or change how politicians 
utilize 
tactics 
of 
fear 
and 
division. But there is a radically 
simple 
solution 
of 
how 
to 
reconnect with our communities 
and 
face 
potentially 
toxic 

positions of policy: discourse. 
In my hometown, the unspoken 
homogeneity of political opinion 
created an atmosphere where 
I felt misunderstood, unheard 
and unvalued. Peers in school 
espoused 
extreme 
right-
wing positions their parents 
supported, yet when we took 
a political aptitude test in AP 
U.S. Government and Politics 
class, the majority of the class 
fell beneath the category “new 
generation liberal.” The inability 
to truly listen to someone’s 
opinion 
you 
disagree 
with 
and the fear of asking genuine 
questions 
in 
an 
empathetic 
way 
creates 
an 
atmosphere 
of 
disillusion, 
isolation 
and 
contention. The toxicity of the 
current political sphere makes 
any conversation feel like it 
could be on the precipice of 
condescension and conflict.
Historically, 
it 
has 
been 
deemed 
impolite 
to 
discuss 
your political opinions — I 
believe in the opposite. Actively 
educate yourself on current 
events, 
political 
candidates 
and 
propositioned 
policies. 
Engage with people who don’t 
see things your way, despite 
the 
comparative 
comforts 
of placing yourself within a 
like-minded 
community. 
Ask 
questions, aim to understand 
values rather than positions and 
empathize with people from 
different backgrounds. Political 
passion 
and 
investment 
are 
crucial to the commonwealth 
and learning how to listen, 
empathize 
and 
acknowledge 
mutual values should make 2020 
transformative, not regressive. 
Believe in our common humanity 
this upcoming election season — 
if we don’t, the results could tear 
us apart.

Are we losing personal identity?
I

n 
1837, 
Ralph 
Waldo 
Emerson 
spoke 
before 
the 
Phi 
Beta 
Kappa 
Society at Harvard University 
and delivered an oration that 
ignited American intellectuals. 
“The American Scholar” was 
highly controversial; it decried 
the 
American 
academic 
model of the times for its 
lack of originality and over-
dependence on its European 
predecessors. It championed 
the individual as the primary 
unit in society and sought to 
spur the best and brightest into 
action. The world is a much 
different place today, a place of 
constant discovery, innovation 
and creation. Yet I fear society 
may 
be 
silently 
sliding, 
endangering an integral part 
of American society: an iron-
clad faith in the value of the 
individual. But how can a 
19th century thinker aid our 
modern dilemma? And what 
does a 183-year-old speech 
offer us? More than you might 
think. 
Early 
in 
“The 
American 
Scholar,” we find Emerson 
praising 
the 
individual 
and discussing the role of 
the scholar in society. He 
addresses the scholar’s worst-
case scenario, and says “in 
the degenerate state, when 
the victim of society, he tends 
to become a mere thinker, 
or, still worse, the parrot 
of 
other 
men’s 
thinking.” 
The 
notion 
of 
becoming 
another’s puppet by means 
of not thinking for oneself is 
appalling to Emerson. It’s the 
scholar’s worst act of treason: 
a conscious relinquishment of 
the mind. Sadly, today, I can 
think of several examples of 
this dynamic, everywhere from 
campus to the capital. 
Later 
in 
the 
speech, 
Emerson gives his crux of 
individualism and says “the 
one thing in the world, of 
value, is the active soul. This 
every man is entitled to; this 
every man contains within 
him ... The soul active sees 
absolute truth; and utters 
truth, or creates. In this action, 
it is genius; not the privilege 
of here and there a favorite, 
but the sound estate of every 
man.” Emerson conveys his 
total belief in the ability of 
the individual. Everyone has 
the natural-born capacity to 
create, he argues, and that 
conviction – classified as the 
“active soul” – is the one thing 

of true value. Further, he says 
this ability is “the sound estate 
of every man.” To my ear, this 
sounds eerily familiar to the 
American Dream, no? That’s 
because it is. 
The American Dream is the 
purest modern concretization 
of individualism. It is a global 
notion that any individual 
can succeed in the United 
States through hard work, 
determination and integrity. 
This belief has propelled our 
country forward throughout 
history and has created the 
most productive nation in 
human history. At its core lies 
an incorruptible faith in the 
value of the individual, and 
their ability to effect change 
by their own agency. 

But what’s the problem here? 
I mentioned earlier this silent 
regression occurring in society, 
and that Emerson’s wisdom 
might be able to help. Emerson 
outlines 
the 
paramount 
responsibility of the scholar 
“to resist the vulgar prosperity 
that 
retrogrades 
ever 
to 
barbarism, 
by 
preserving 
and 
communicating 
heroic 
sentiments, noble biographies, 
melodious 
verse, 
and 
the 
conclusions of history.” As 
students at this university, 
we are the scholars Emerson 
addresses, and he asks of us a 
great deal. Using the lessons 
history has afforded us, we 
must 
each 
recognize 
the 
wolf in sheep’s clothing – the 
“vulgar 
prosperity” 
– 
and 
by means of forging our own 
intellectual path, guide society 
away to safer ground. Emerson 
believed that “each age must 
write its own books,” and for 
this, the active soul is intrinsic. 
As the American Dream 
illustrates, 
in 
emphasizing 
the individual you naturally 
emphasize ambition and incite 
a passion to succeed. The 
active soul and the ability to 
shape your future reinforce 
these 
notions. 
But 
equally 

as important are the notions 
of 
equality, 
compassion 
and respect. Herein lies the 
true value in emphasizing 
the 
individual. 
These 
interpersonal 
virtues 
break 
down when people are split 
into “us” and “them.” Instead, 
if we focus on each individual, 
we avoid such divisions and 
promote these indispensable 
virtues. 
Society 
today 
has 
unfortunately accommodated 
a 
rise 
in 
populism 
and 
nationalism, both of which 
can be equally characterized 
as embodying an “us versus 
them” 
mentality, 
in 
one 
form or another. If you ask 
five people why this is the 
case, you’ll likely hear five 
different answers, but here’s 
mine: We’ve forgotten the 
importance of valuing the 
individual. 
We’re 
moving 
backward; slowly losing a 
connection with the notion 
that “the one thing in the 
world, of value, is the active 
soul ... (it) creates,” and that 
it belongs to every individual. 
Emerson 
concluded 
his 
argument 
for 
the 
virtues 
of 
the 
individual 
with 
a 
prescient warning: “genius is 
always sufficiently the enemy 
of genius by over influence.”
When 
you’re 
confronted 
with a choice, I implore you 
to 
independently 
assess 
the quality of all decisions. 
Don’t subscribe to an idea or 
movement 
on 
the 
grounds 
that someone you trust, or 
someone in authority, bought 
in and that’s good enough for 
you; that’s how any number of 
historical horrors originated. 
Take a step back, think for 
yourself and act with purpose. 
Consider 
your 
goals 
and 
identify whether they truly 
belong to you, or if they were set 
before you by someone else. Be 
ambitious in your intellectual 
and artistic endeavors – strive 
to create something new and 
personify 
originality. 
And 
do so only if it is something 
that you truly seek. Emerson 
understood this on two levels: 
the individual and society. He 
felt society losing touch with 
the individual, and sought to 
breathe life once more into his 
breast. Now, 183 years later, 
we’re in dire need of that same 
breath.

JENNY GURUNG | COLUMN

Spending all of my undergrad completing pre-requisites
I 

came across a headline 
titled 
“University 
of 
Michigan pre-med program 
No. 1 in the country, according to 
rankings.” What does it mean to 
be a pre-medical student at the 
University, though? Of course, 
there is a plethora of resources 
available to students from the 
University Career Center’s pre-
health directory, from well-
equipped 
pre-health/pre-med 
fraternities to huge student 
organizations that centralize 
these resources. Students at 
the University of Michigan are 
definitely better equipped with 
advisers, mentors and other 
resources to be better applicants 
than 
students 
from 
other 
universities, but the problem 
lies with the pre-med system 
being inherently competitive 
and forcing students to make a 
commitment to the career early 
on.
I often hear people say, 
“I could never do pre-med 
because of the workload,” or, 
“If you can’t take the pressure/
workload, don’t be pre-med.” 
The harsh reality is that these 
sentiments are true. The list 
of pre-med courses goes on 
and on. Prerequisites include 
rigorous and notoriously hard 
classes like Physics for the Life 
Sciences, Organic Chemistry 
and Biochemistry on top of 
others that help you prepare 
for topics tested on the MCAT, 
like physiology and anatomy. 
These classes fill your schedule 
and take up almost all of your 
undergraduate 
credits 
to 
complete. The pressure to not 
just do well in these classes but 
excel in them constantly looms 
over your transcript. Applying 
to medical school is inherently 
competitive, 
with 
schools 
like New York University that 
started providing free medical 
school tuition, an applicant 
pool that nearly doubled with 
an average GPA of 3.87 and an 
acceptance rate of 1.6 percent.

When 
everyone 
in 
your 
classes is striving for an ‘A’ 
because they can’t afford to 
drop below that average, even 
if you’re getting the same 
grades as them, you feel like a 
mediocre student and applicant. 
This is my pre-med dilemma. 
Mediocre. 
Commonplace. 
Neither a success nor a failure. 
Typical. 

What does it mean to be a 
typical applicant though? The 
American 
Medical 
College 
Application 
Service, 
the 
Common 
App 
for 
medical 
schools, has multiple sections to 
include your GPA, MCAT score 
and extracurricular activities. 
The Work and Activities section 
has up to 15 experiences from 
volunteer 
(medical 
and 
not 
medical) 
to 
employment 
to 
research that you can describe 
in up to 700 words. Pre-med 
students end up obsessing over 
filling their resumes with the 
usual medical and research 
experiences, such as shadowing 
or being a nurse’s assistant. 
They chase after opportunities 
to shadow clinicians, race to 
get published in their research 
mentor’s next paper and vie for 
leadership opportunities in their 
student organization. 
Pre-med 
students 
feel 
a 
relentless 
need 
to 
keep 
themselves extremely busy with 
extracurricular activities. On 
top of a heavy course load, pre-
med students are pressured 
to fill up their free time doing 

something. 
This 
is 
normal. 
Normal is constantly feeling 
overworked and like there’s no 
time to do everything. Even as 
I am sitting down writing this, 
I am thinking about how to find 
the time next week to study for 
two exams, write a paper, juggle 
work and extracurriculars.
The worst part of the process: 
the sky-high application fees 
for medical school and the 
hundreds of thousands of dollars 
of debt that medical students 
accumulate. 
Dedicating 
your 
entire undergraduate career to 
fulfilling pre-med prerequisites 
(you definitely won’t remember 
which functional group on a 
molecule contributes the most to 
resonance five years in the future) 
only to be left with thousands in 
debt is not very promising. This 
aspect has also pushed many 
people away from the profession 
altogether, because it forces 
people to commit to and decide if 
they want to pursue a career in 
medicine. 
Asking 
undergraduate 
students to make a commitment 
to multiple sleepless nights, 
a 
stressful 
curriculum 
and 
countless 
extracurriculars 
is 
absurd. But there’s only so much 
students can single-handedly do 
about the rigorous nature of pre-
med. In my own experience, it 
has helped me to know that other 
students are also struggling 
with classes and juggling (a bit 
clumsily) all of their work. I 
regularly try to step back from 
the overwhelming torrent of it 
all to remind myself that being 
pre-med isn’t an easy task — even 
though some people might make 
it look easy. At the end of the day, 
though, pre-med is a path I’ve 
currently chosen to go down, 
and I’ve found that the best way 
I deal with sleepless nights is a 
study break with coffee, snacks 
and good friends.

This review contains spoilers.
Over the course of its four 
seasons, “The Good Place” 
kept its audience on the edge 
of their seats with one big plot 
twist after the next. While this 
unusual 
sitcom 
beautifully 
balanced high-stakes conflict 
with 
individual 
character 
growth, the finale began with 
the show’s biggest questions 
already 
answered. 
From 
redesigning the fundamentally 
flawed afterlife to reorganizing 
The Good Place, all plot points 
had been resolved. All that was 
left was to spend a supersized 
episode 
with 
the 
people, 
demons and Janets we have 
grown to adore.
Showrunner 
and 
creator, 
Michael 
Schur, 
has 
only 
concluded one other show, 
“Parks and Recreation,” and 
the 
similarities 
between 
these two shows’ finales are 
undeniable. If you can recall, 
the “Parks and Recreation” 
finale served as an epilogue of 
sorts, giving viewers a preview 
into the future of each of the 
ensemble 
characters’ 
lives 
and careers. “The Good Place” 
replicates this formula, but on 
a more timeless scale. Rather 
than 
leaping 
ahead 
years, 
“The Good Place” reveals the 
countless “Bearamys” — how 
the show quantifies units of 
time in the afterlife — possible 
for the main characters. Still, 
the message remains the same: 
follow each character’s path to 
their specific happy endings.

The 
penultimate 
episode 
solved the final problem of The 
Good Place: Eternal happiness 
has no ending. Eventually, that 
happiness becomes mindless. 
So, our favorite saviors of the 
afterlife created a way out 
— once you have completed 
everything you ever wished 
you could possibly do, you can 
peacefully end your existence 
— making an infinite afterlife 

feel 
slightly 
less 
endless. 
Naturally, this episode titled 
“Whenever 
You’re 
Ready” 
follows 
our 
characters’ 
voluntary, peaceful and chosen 
ends of their existences. 
While the show’s premise 
was 
originally 
centered 
around 
protagonist 
Eleanor 
(Kristen Bell, “Frozen 2”) and 
her 
inadvertent 
placement 
into the Good Place, the show 
eventually evolved, following 
the main characters’ attempts 
to 
repair 
the 
inequalities 
present in the afterlife. Instead 

of one big final plot twist, “The 
Good Place” returned to how 
it began, before the larger 
issues of humanity outweighed 
smaller 
developments 
like 
the romance of Jason and 
Janet. Endings reveal the true 
priorities of television shows. 
“The Good Place” resolved 
the big questions first so 
it could return to where it 
has always belonged — with 
Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, Jason, 
Michael and Janet. Through its 
discussion of moral philosophy 
and exploration of ethics in a 
just society, “The Good Place” 
took an optimistic outlook on 
humanity: People can be self-
centered, indecisive, impulsive 
and arrogant, but given the 
chance they can also learn and 
grow. I’ll raise a margarita to 
that any day.
The final scene suggests 
the greatest reward for living 
on earth is the ability to 
continuously touch the lives 
of those we left behind. As 
individuals, we can only hope 
our actions will contribute 
to making the world a better 
place 
for 
those 
who 
still 
live in it. Yes, it may be as 
simple as deciding to take the 
garbage out or emptying the 
dishwasher when you know it’s 
not your turn. But maybe, just 
maybe, you were unconsciously 
inspired by some random spark 
of goodness by someone from 
your past. It makes sense that 
the character that underwent 
the most change gets to say the 
final words of the show. In the 
words of the demon-turned-
human Michael, “with all the 
love in my heart and all the 
wisdom of the universe — take 
it sleazy.”

‘The Good Place’ moves us 
past the afterlife in finale

NBC

JUSTIN POLLACK
Daily Arts Writer

My fingertips were first rolled in 
what felt like an ink stamp pad. The 
artist then pressed a cold drawing 
utensil to the skin of my left arm. 
I sat there, sterile, removed from 
my own body and experience. My 
left arm stuck through the wall, 
vulnerable to the gallery’s cool air.
Basel Zaraa’s “As Far As My 
Fingertips Take” is an artistic 
performance curated by UMS, a 
multi-disciplinary arts presenter 
affiliated with the University, in 
partnership with the University’s 
Institute for the Humanities. 
“Fingertips” 
is 
one 
of 
four 
performance titles that comprises 
UMS’s “No Safety Net” festival. All 
of the performances in “No Safety 
Net” deal with socially or politically 
relevant issues. “Fingertips” runs 
from Jan. 23 to Feb. 9 at the U-M 
Institute for Humanities and the 
Arab American National Museum 
in Dearborn, MI.
The motif of fingertips is 
inspired by the Dublin Regulation, 
an 
EU 
database 
that 
tracks 
refugees’ 
fingerprints. 
Quite 
often, these refugees would be 
sent back to the last country their 
fingerprints were recorded in.

Zaraa is an artist and musician, 
and a Palestinian refugee born 
in Syria. He currently resides 
in Birmingham, UK. Tania El 
Khoury, a prolific contemporary 
experimental 
performer 
based 
in Beirut, commissioned Zaraa 

to 
create 
this 
intimate 
and 
empathy-building 
installation. 
This performance is based on his 
sister’s refugee journey.
UMS programming director 
Mary 
Roeder 
described 
the 
performance as emotionally hefty 

as it is physical, allowing audience 
members 
to 
understand 
the 
personal refugee journey.
Senior programming director 
at UMS, Marc Jacobson described 
the performance as an “intimate, 
one-on-one, 
performance 
experience that’s approximately 
10 to 15 minutes” for “anyone who 
wants to become closer to the 
understanding of the refugee crisis 
globally.”
“Many of us in the West, me 
included, have a sympathetic 
response to the global crisis, 
but speaking for myself, I’m not 
readily in touch with members of 
this displaced global community. 
After experiencing ‘Fingertips’, 
it 
becomes 
very 
personal, 
empathetic,” Jacobson said.
When 
my 
fifteen 
minutes 
arrived last Thursday night, the 
artist’s cold hands adjusted my 
arm and fingers for each part of 
the drawing. It felt like one of 
those childhood games or secret 
codes where you try to guess what 
word someone was writing on your 
thigh or back. The elongated lines 
and focused splotches of ink made 
me think it was a vine adorned 
with flowers and leaves.
As the artist drew on my exposed 
arm, old-fashioned headphones 
covered the entirety of my ears. I 
heard the waves first. The crashing 

waters of the Mediterreanian 
harmonized with the cawing of 
seagulls. Zaara’s voice crooned 
through my headphones, narrating 
the journey he and his sisters took 
through Europe.
He said he was going to play 
a song, the English translation 
written on the wall above my seat. 
The song began with a traditional 
wail and instrumentation, then the 
artist transitioned into rapping the 
second half of the song.
The cold utensil sailing across 
my skin felt otherworldly, distant 
and sacred. We were offered to 
wash our arms and hands in a 
basin right after the experience. To 
rinse away the experience begged 
the question of how the rest of the 
world, not personally impacted 
by the refugee struggle, decides 
to respond to this suffering. It felt 
almost disrespectful to erase an 
experience like this. I felt that it 

deserved to linger and be on the 
forefront of my mind for at least 
the time the ink remained on my 
skin.
After the performance, I told 
Zaraa that it felt like going to 
confession. 
Something 
about 
the separation with the white 
walls and the shadows of the 
room recalled a kind of spiritual 
cleansing, an acknowledgement 
of the vastness of the world and 
human experience.
In 
the 
days 
following 
“Fingertips,” I looked up how the 
refugee crisis has evolved in the 
past few years. I also lamented the 
drawing’s slow fade on my skin, 
saddened every time a shower 
or sweater rubbed a certain part 
away.
One of the most vulnerable 
parts of the experience was the 
drawing of a boat attached to a 
string drawn from the center of 

my palm to the tip of my middle 
finger. My arm featured people 
all walking in a single direction 
carrying backpacks and suitcases, 
even the children. They all moved 
towards the crook of my elbow 
where a line was drawn around 
the circumference of my upper 
forearm. They seemed to be 
walking to the harshly drawn 
black line of discrimination and 
apathy they faced on their journey. 
Roeder 
remarked 
on 
what 
lingers in the consciousnesses 
of those who participated in 
“Fingertips.”
“I think you can intellectualize 
things all day long and post on 
Facebook that ‘I feel so bad these 
things are happening,’ but what 
action are you taking? What 
impact is that ‘feeling bad’ having? 
Does it take having this physical 
encounter with someone to find 
change in yourself?”

COURTESY OF NINA MOLINA

Needles littering the floor, 
desperate 
addicts 
searching 
for a score, shuttered windows 
and 
crumbling 
homes; 
the 
opening picture author Liz 
Moore paints of Kensington 
conveys a relentlessly bleak and 
hopeless world. Moore’s new 
mystery thriller novel, “Long 
Bright River,” takes us into 
the underbelly of Philadelphia, 
into 
a 
once-respectable 
neighborhood now plagued by 
the opioid crisis. The sad reality 
of opioid addiction is a subject 
many authors shy away from in 
popular literature, but Moore 
digs deep without hesitation. In 
her new novel, Moore explores 
the harsh truth of addiction and 
weaves a gut-wrenching tale of 
familial devotion, poverty and 
crime. 
Told in urgent and concise 
prose, “Long Bright River” 
follows the story of two sisters 
separated 
by 
circumstance. 
The older of the two, Mickey 
Fitzpatrick, is a police officer 
charged with the impossible 
task 
of 
curbing 
crime 
in 
Kensington. Her sister, Kacey, 
surrendered to the temptation 
of narcotics at a young age like 
her mother before her and now 
lives out her days on the streets, 
doing just about anything for 
a score. Though inseparable 
growing up, the two sisters 
are estranged because Kacey 
is unable to get clean. When 
a 
string 
of 
murders 
racks 
Kensington just as Kacey goes 
missing, Mickey, motivated by 
sisterly devotion and love, goes 
looking for her.
One 
of 
Moore’s 
clearest 
strengths is the deliberate and 
carefully 
measured 
manner 
in which she constructs the 
narrative. 
Moore 
expertly 
divulges 
just 
enough 
information 
in 
calculated 
increments to keep the reader 
hungry for more. The story is 
told from Mickey’s perspective 
on two alternating timelines, 
the girls’ childhood (“then”) 
and 
the 
present 
(“now”), 
where Mickey spends her days 
patrolling the streets with her 
irritating new partner Eddie 
Laffery. The beauty of this 
structure is the insight it offers 
into why Kacey is the way she 
is. We get to see young Kacey, 
a bubbly, fierce and passionate 
girl who “made friends every 

place she went” and who rose 
“ardently and often violently to 
the defense of those in her class 
who were lowest in the pecking 
order.” Comparing the bright 
teenage Kacey to the lifeless 
shell of a person that she 
becomes under the influence 
of drugs makes the emotional 
impact of her downfall all the 

more searing. 
The 
novel 
starts 
off 
slowly, and at first it is hard 
to 
acclimate 
to 
Mickey’s 
reserved and often pessimistic 
personality. However, as events 
unfold and the story picks 
up, the book becomes almost 
impossible to put down. Each 
chapter brings new suspects 
and a surprising turn of events, 
leaving us grasping at straws 
until 
the 
very 
last 
pages. 
Mickey also blossoms into a 
three-dimensional 
character 
as the sacrifices she makes for 
her sister and son reveal the 
depth of her love for them. The 
reader is swept up in a gripping 
mystery, speculating alongside 
Mickey on who is responsible 
for the murders and why Kacey 
disappeared. 
All of the elements of a good 
novel are there: suspense, love, 

tragedy and intrigue. But the 
most powerful characteristic 
of “Long Bright River” is its 
depiction of the endless cycle 
of addiction. It both humanizes 
the victims and provides a raw, 
unembellished perspective into 
horror and hopelessness of 
narcotic dependence. As Moore 
beautifully puts is, addicts are 
trapped “in a river, no fount 
and no outlet, a long bright 
river of departed souls.” At 
times, fighting addiction seems 
futile. 
Nevertheless, 
small 
rays of hope shine through as 
Mickey tirelessly fights for her 
sister. The lengths she goes to 
find Kacey are heartening and 
inspiring. 
A lot of buzz surrounded the 
release of “Long Bright River” 
in the literary community, and, 
without a doubt, the addictive 
tale lives up to the hype. The 
novel could ensnare the heart 
of any reader in its roller 
coaster of emotions. The story 
is real, raw and heartfelt, and 
Mickey unfolds into a three-
dimensional heroine before 
our eyes. It leaves the reader 
with a new perspective on 
addiction, the inevitability of it 
and the seemingly predestined 
fate of the addict. The novel 
also inspires sympathy for 
the victims, who, more often 
than not, turn to drugs as 
a 
result 
of 
environmental 
factors out of their control. We 
realize: It could be us, in other 
circumstances, in a parallel 
life. We avoided this wretched 
life through luck, because we 
didn’t have family members 
who pressured us into narcotic 
use or lived in an environment 
like Kensington where drugs 
are the norm. “Long Bright 
River” 
reminds 
us 
of 
the 
fragility of good fortune and to 
cherish what we have, because 
for some, even the simple act 
of experiencing life sober is a 
daily struggle.

“mitchel mingi hong.”

Before I had even set foot in 
the Midwest, I felt like I had a 
bit of an idea what the Midwest 
sounded like. Discovering bands 
that were integral to the past, 
present and future of the DIY 
Midwest emo scene painted a 
picture in my mind about what 
growing up in the Midwest would 
be like. One of the first bands that 
really caught my attention was 
the group Empire! Empire! (I was 
a Lonely Estate). As I explored the 
scene more and more, I started to 
listen to other bands, like Into It, 
Over It., Snowing and even Ann 
Arbor’s Brave Bird. The one thing 
uniting all of these bands was 
their label: Count Your Lucky 
Stars (CYLS). 
Started by members of Empire! 
Empire! (I was a Lonely Estate), 
Keith and Cathy Latinen, CYLS 
started as a way for the band 
to release a 7” they originally 
recorded for a split with Florida’s 
Save Mexico. In a phone interview 
with The Daily, Keith Latinen 
talked about the independent 
label’s origin. 
“I don’t think we started the 
label with any great aspirations,” 
Latinen said. “It was just a vehicle 
for us to put out our own band’s 
record, and then when we started 
touring more and more, we 
started to see all these incredible 
bands that were also in the same 
situation as us where no labels 
were paying attention to them 
and there was no way for people 
to hear those bands. So, we just 

started putting out those bands, 
and it just kind of evolved from 
there.”
Latinen 
described 
how 
entering the age of the internet 
changed everything for smaller 
DIY bands, especially for CYLS. 
“We get orders from all over the 
world, and there’s no way those 
people would have ever heard of 
us without the internet,” Latinen 
said. “It connects everything.” 
Latinen talked about initially 
messaging people on Myspace to 
promote the label, and said “when 
we first started getting orders 
from anywhere we were really 
excited, but when we started 
getting orders from overseas, it 
really kind of blew our minds.”

Latinen 
emphasized 
how 
with increased connection to 
the internet, “it’s a lot easier 
to connect with people, and 
invite those people to shows. A 
lot of places that we played in 
Michigan, the Midwest and on 
tour … I never would have known 
about it if it wasn’t for someone 
from 
that 
DIY 
community 
reaching out to me.” 
Along with the internet, he 
also believes that tolerance and 
openness play a large role in 
DIY ethics and its growth, and 
because of that mentality, “if one 
DIY venue ended up shutting 
down, there will be somebody 
else that would pick that slack 
up and there’d be a new place for 
bands to play.”
As 
a 
newcomer 
to 
the 
Midwest, I asked Latinen about 
how he thought the Midwest 
impacted his music and the DIY 
community. 
“I think the term Midwest emo 
comes from living in these wide 
open spaces, long drives, and the 
earnestness and honesty that 
you’d associate with the Midwest 
too,” Latinen said. “And I think 
that has something to do with 
the openness and patience in my 
music. And that’s part of being 
a Michigander too — it’s that 

patience and sort of appreciating 
beauty for what it is.” 
Latinen talked about how these 
characteristics of the Midwestern 
scene helped Empire! Empire! (I 
was a Lonely Estate) back when 
they first started playing shows, 
saying that one of their first 
shows in Ypsilanti “was with a 
bunch of screamo bands.” 
And that local DIY support 
doesn’t just stop in southeastern 
Michigan — it’s global. Because 
of their connections with labels 
across the world, the band 
was able to have international 
pressings of their records and 
even play a series of shows in 
Japan and Europe. 
“It’s surreal,” Latinen said. “I 
think every local scene sort of 
chains together to the larger DIY 
scene, and it makes you feel at 
home wherever you play.” 
In early 2016, the band decided 
to call it quits, and Latinen took 
a break from signing new bands 
onto CYLS. However, towards 
the end of 2019, CYLS announced 
the signing of their newest group 
in quite some time, Overo, along 
with the release of the group’s 
debut album. Shortly after, the 
label announced the signing 
of another new group, Singing 
Lungs, along with a new EP they 
would be putting out. Then, on 
Nov. 4, CYLS announced the 
album Tomorrow I Will Take a 
Knife to Your Confidence from a 
band called Anna Flyaway.
Started over 14 years ago, 
the group was originally a solo 
project by Latinen in college, but 
later went on to include many of 
his friends. Towards the end of 
recording their debut album, a 
series of lineup changes and the 
loss of their recording engineer 
indicated that the band might not 
have the longevity to finish the 
project. So, Latinen took matters 
into his own hands, learning to 
record on his own and in turn 
starting a new project, Empire! 
Empire! (I was a Lonely Estate), 
just as the band broke up.
“It took years and years but 
we finally ended up doing it. I 
do sort of a stereotypical list of 
New Year’s Resolutions every 
year, and every year ‘Finish Anna 
Flyaway’ was at the top of that 
list. So I finally got to cross that 
off this year,” Latinen said. 
The amount of care put into the 
album really shows. Between the 
sincere lyrics and harmonically 
rich arrangements, the album 
reminded me of why I began 
romanticizing the Midwest, and 
the magic of this music. Check 
out Anna Flyaway’s album, or any 
of the other new bands on CYLS, 
and you’ll see what I mean. It’s 
Midwestern magic.

After the release of their 2017 
album, The Underside of Power, 
it was unclear which direction 
Algiers would take their music. 
The only certainty was that their 
next full-length project would 
come with a lot of expectations. 
With The Underside of Power, 
they managed to perfect the 
gospel and post-punk sound they 
flirted with on their debut record. 
Many fans were simply hoping 
to hear more of the same. Others 
wanted more noise-rock and post-
rock influences in their repertoire. 
Regardless, the anticipation was 
palpable. In late 2019, the fans 
finally got the news they wanted, 
as Algiers announced their next 
release for Matador Records, There 
Is No Year. The question now was 
whether they would expand on the 
sound of their last record or go in 
a completely different direction. 
Unfortunately, we may have set 
our expectations too high.
This is clearly a new sonic 
direction for Algiers. The novel 
sound expresses a sentiment of 
dilapidation 
and 
exhaustion, 
which is best illustrated with 
their heavy use of synths. This is 
not to say that the project takes 
sounds from synth-wave or adds 
pop qualities to their music. In 
fact, most of the synth lies in the 
lower register which adds an 
ulcer-inducing tension with nearly 
every track. Often this record feels 
subterranean, like on the track 
“Wait for the Sound,” where the 
pulsing, synth bass mixed with the 
lead singer’s soulful crooning can 

easily get under one’s skin. This 
track also exemplifies Algiers’ 
decision to make this record their 
least instrumentally dense, with 
the synth and vocals being the 
two primary forces of the song. 
Quite poetically, There Is No Year 
tries to be the valley that comes 
after the mountain that was The 
Underside of Power. The problem 
surrounding the new record is the 
band’s inability to fully commit 
to this new style. Whether it’s on 
songs like the title track, or the 

closer “Void,” or in other smaller 
moments, Algiers can’t seem to let 
go of their post-punk roots. They 
can’t fully rid themselves of the 
wall-punching, bombastic energy 
that has started to define them, 
and the lyrical content certainly 
proves the point. 
Algiers have always embodied 
the spirit of protest. The genesis 
of their name ties back to the city 
itself, which is known for having 
a history of anti-colonial dissent. 
Frontman Franklin James Fisher 
uses his powerful lyricism and 
forceful vocal prowess to create 
this atmosphere. In this particular 
album, he weaves a narrative 

addressing 
the 
disintegration 
of society and the individuals 
that inhabit it. On the track 
“Dispossession,” 
he 
aims 
his 
crosshairs directly at the current 
state of America and how it has 
developed from a place that once 
offered so much, to one that 
takes as much as it can. Each 
track develops its own idea that 
ultimately 
contributes 
to 
the 
overarching narrative in a way that 
feels uninterrupted. Perhaps it’s 
not so surprising that nearly every 
word on this album comes from 
an epic poem Fisher wrote titled 
“Misophonia.” The poetry on this 
record is almost breathtaking at 
times, but it never aligns with the 
music playing beneath it.
Ultimately, 
this 
conflict 
between 
verse 
and 
music 
demonstrates a fundamental issue 
surrounding the band. It feels like 
they haven’t located their identity 
yet. Embracing their post-punk 
roots would mean having to forgo 
the less-is-more approach they 
have 
towards 
instrumentals; 
favoring this new meditative 
and gloomy atmosphere would 
require the lyrical content to 
complement this dourness better. 
It seems like they are struggling 
to make this decision, which is 
strange considering how confident 
they sounded on their previous 
release. It could be that There Is 
No Year is actually an admission 
of this apparent lack of direction. 
The album cover even alludes to 
this — large block letters spelling 
out the name of the band are 
depicted 
tumbling 
above 
the 
picture of a man falling through 
the sky. Perhaps Algiers feels as 
though they are the man tumbling 
through the sky, powerless in their 
movement.

After years of turmoil, longtime Michigan State coach Dantonio retires

Mark Dantonio, who brought 
Michigan State football back 
to prominence in the Big Ten, 
announced Tuesday that he would 
be stepping down as head coach of 
the Spartans.
“Today makes one of the most 
difficult decisions that I have ever 
made here at Michigan State,” he 
said in a statement on his Twitter 
account. “ … I will miss it all but 
feel the sacrifices that I have made 
away from my family must now 
become my priority at this time in 
my life.” 
Dantonio 
also 
announced 
that he will transition into a role 
with the athletic department as a 
special projects adviser.
In 
13 
seasons, 
Dantonio 
went 114-57, won three Big 
Ten 
championships 
and 
led 
the Spartans to 12 bowl games, 
including a Rose Bowl win in 2013 
and a College Football Playoff 
appearance in 2015. He revived 
the 
Michigan-Michigan 
State 
rivalry, going 8-5 against the 
Wolverines.
However, things had been 
trending down both on and off 
the field in recent years. The 
Spartans finished 7-6 each of 
the past two seasons while the 
program was mired in scandal. 
In a lawsuit against Dantonio and 
other top Michigan State officials, 
former recruiting director Curtis 
Blackwell accused Dantonio of 
ignoring reports of sexual assault 
against former player Auston 
Robertson dating back to his high-
school days, then scapegoating 
Blackwell. 
According 
to 
a 
Detroit News report released 
Tuesday, Blackwell’s lawyers also 
accused Dantonio of committing 
recruiting-related 
NCAA 
violations, giving employment to 
parents of recruits and making 
home visits with staffers who 
were not authorized to do so.
Before that, a 2018 ESPN 
Outside the Lines report found 
that 16 Spartan football players had 
been accused of sexual misconduct 
during Dantonio’s tenure and 

that the school attempted to 
suppress those records. Dantonio 
and other coaches were accused 
of mishandling the allegations, 
though were never punished for 
doing so.
Despite 
these 
issues, 
the 
athletic department stood by 
Dantonio throughout the 2019 
season. 
Early 
in 
November, 
Michigan State athletic director 
Bill Beekman told reporters that 
firing Dantonio was “not even a 
discussion.”
Dantonio had a $4.3 million 
retention bonus in his contract 
— which has essentially been a 
lifetime contract since 2011 — that 
vested on Jan. 15.
His retirement also came a 
day before National Signing Day, 
which could throw the Spartans’ 
recruiting situation into flux — 
something they can ill afford, 
given that their 2020 recruiting 
class is ranked just 10th out of 14 
Big Ten teams, per 247Sports. All 
but three of their commits signed 
letters of intent on early signing 
day in December.
The program has announced 
that Mike Tressel, previously the 
assistant head coach, defensive 
coordinator 
and 
linebackers 
coach, will serve as the interim 
head coach. Tressel worked on the 
same staff as Dantonio for the last 
15 seasons.
Cincinnati coach Luke Fickell 
has been named in multiple 
reports as a potential full-time 
replacement.

EAST LANSING — Mark 
Dantonio spent the past few 
weeks hitting the recruiting 
trail as always, visiting schools 
and talking to high school 
prospects.
He realized that it was 
getting increasingly hard to 
promise kids that he would still 
be the coach when they came in 
2022. The nonstop grind began 
to weigh on him. He realized he 
was 50/50 on what to do about 
his future. As he explained this 
all at a press conference on 
Tuesday night at the Breslin 
Center, the former Michigan 
State football coach extended 
his hand out to his right.
“In the end, if you’re 50/50 
on something, you need to be 
over here, because this job 
demands 100 percent,” he said.
As Dantonio flew back and 
forth from those visits, he 
began to draft a statement 
about why he wanted to step 
away, a decision he announced 
Tuesday afternoon.
The 
timing 
is 
awkward, 
to 
put 
it 
generously. 
The 
coaching carousel has long 
since come to a halt, and many 
of the top young coaching 
candidates already have new 
jobs. 
Dantonio 
announced 
his decision the day before 
National Signing Day, after all 
but three of his 2020 recruits 

have signed National Letters 
of Intent, binding themselves 
to a program that is suddenly 
without a coach. The Detroit 
News reported earlier in the 
day that, in an ongoing lawsuit 
filed 
by 
former 
recruiting 
director 
Curtis 
Blackwell, 
Dantonio was alleged to have 
committed multiple recruiting 
violations in his time with 
the Spartans. And Dantonio 
recently earned a $4.3 million 
retention bonus for remaining 
with the team through Jan. 15.
Dantonio offered up his own 
justification for the timing, 
explaining the many cycles 
of being a college football 
coach, including the one every 
February where he resets his 
football team, saying goodbye 
to the seniors and bringing in 
the rookies, in preparation for 
spring ball.
“As I’ve gone into schools 
in the last week or two weeks, 
these last two weeks of the 
dead period ... I would find 
myself saying, there’s gonna be 
a gap,” Dantonio said. “There’s 
gonna be a gap created if I 
don’t stay, if I leave after next 
season, it’s gonna be a gap in 
recruiting. And the best time, 
I felt, to step away, when you 
reset your football team.”
Meanwhile, Dantonio denied 
that his decision had anything 
to do with the Blackwell lawsuit 
or the recent deposition he was 
required to give. When pressed 
further, he said, “We’re not 
talking about this. This is a 
celebration.” Athletic director 
Bill Beekman later derided the 
allegations as “patently false.”
Dantonio 
waxed 
poetic 
about 
the 
three 
Big 
Ten 
championships, the Rose Bowl, 
the Playoff appearance and the 
players he’d gotten to work 
with. That was the best part 
of the job for him, he said, and 
there was no doubt he’d left the 
program in better shape than 
he’d found it.
Still, that program is now on 
a downward trajectory, having 
finished the last two seasons 

7-6 with losses to Michigan in 
both. The Spartans have the 
10th-best 2020 recruiting class 
in the Big Ten, per 247Sports, 
and haven’t secured a single 
commitment for 2021. Now, 
Beekman has to find a coach 
who can restock the Spartans’ 
cupboard while also competing 
in the difficult Big Ten East.
“I don’t know that there’s 
ever a good time (to retire),” 
Beekman said. “There are times 
that are better than other times. 
But I think that when you’ve 
won 114 games and you’re the 
all-time winningest coach and 
you’ve taken us to the places 
Mark’s taken us, you’ve set the 
bar where Mark’s set it, that 
I was comfortable operating 
on his timeline, whatever that 
would be, and I think that we’ll 
find a very good coach.”
Dantonio and Beekman both 
reflected on what they wanted 
in a new coach and were largely 
in agreement: someone who is 
familiar with the Midwest, 
knows Michigan State’s history 
and culture and has a high 
character. The Spartans’ top 
candidates are reported to be 
Cincinnati coach Luke Fickell 
and 
Pittsburgh 
coach 
Pat 
Narduzzi.
But Dantonio isn’t worried 
about 
finding 
the 
right 
candidate.
“Are 
you 
kidding 
me?” 
Dantonio said. “People will 
run here. They’ll crawl here. 
Michigan State will get an 
outstanding coach that will 
care 
about 
young 
people. 
They have a great foundation 
coming back. This program 
has won a lot more than it’s 
lost, as indicated by 13 years 
of what has been. … My hope 
for anybody who’s choosing 
to coach, I may be involved a 
little bit, maybe not, but that 
they hire somebody who will 
be here 13 or 14 years and win 
114-plus games.”
Meanwhile, 
Dantonio 
plans to move into a special 
ambassador 
role 
with 
the 
athletic 
department, 
a 

provision that was afforded 
him in his contract. Beekman 
and Dantonio haven’t quite 
decided what that role will be 
yet, but Beekman offered up a 
few possibilities they’ve tossed 
around, such as alumni and 
donor engagement and perhaps 
teaching a class on leadership.
For Dantonio, it’s the best 
of both worlds. He gets to stay 
involved with the program 
while cutting back on his 
workload, allowing him to 
spend more time with family 
and developing hobbies he’d 
never had the capacity to 
explore.
When asked to define his 
legacy, Dantonio said it wasn’t 
about the wins and losses, 
“although there’s a lot of 
them.” When he looks back 
on his career, Dantonio will 
remember the people he got 
to work with and the careers 
he helped shape. More than 
most other coaches, Dantonio 
has come to define Michigan 
State football — for better and 
for worse. He was the coach 
who 
brought 
the 
Spartans 
back to prominence, redefined 
the rivalry with Michigan and 
made a Big Ten laughingstock 
into 
a 
powerhouse. 
He’s 
also the coach who showed 
arguably undeserved loyalty 
to his assistants after down 
seasons and the coach who 
allegedly mishandled sexual 
assault allegations.
It’s 
hard 
to 
envision 
Michigan State without him, 
but that’s exactly the task the 
athletic department now has 
on its hands. He may have 
defined the program as it is 
today, but now, Dantonio wants 
more than just the program to 
define him.
“I’ve told my players on 
many occasions that Michigan 
State is bigger than any one 
person,” 
Dantonio 
said. 
“It’s the program that’s so 
important. Someday there will 
be someone else talking to you 
from this podium. That day has 
come.”

Mayotte revitalizing penalty kill

A backdoor rebound on a 
five-on-three advantage and a 
perfectly placed shot at Penn 
State. A bounce off a Michigan 
defenseman’s stick in front of 
the net against Ohio State. A 
wide-open 
forward 
sniping 
over Mann’s shoulder from 
the slot against those same 
Buckeyes.
These 
are 
the 
only 
three power play goals the 
Wolverines have allowed to 
start the second half of the 
season. Michigan has killed off 
18 other penalties, two of them 
five-minute majors, without 
allowing a goal.
Only one of them came 
off a true breakdown in the 
penalty kill. A five-on-three 
is one of the toughest tasks 
for 
a 
penalty-killing 
unit, 
and an unlucky bounce off a 
defenseman’s stick is just that 
— unlucky.
Friday night against Ohio 
State, the Wolverines gave up 
two goals to Ohio State on the 
power play. Saturday night, 
Michigan turned around and 
killed all three of the Buckeyes’ 
power 
plays 
— 
including 
killing two five-minute major 
penalties.
“We 
didn’t 
change 
anything,” assistant coach Kris 
Mayotte said Monday. “I just 
think we simply didn’t execute 
who we’ve been on the kill 
recently on Friday. I thought 
we got a little too aggressive, 
and while we’re a kill that likes 
to pressure in certain spots, we 
still have to be under control.”
On 
Saturday, 
freshman 
forward Johnny Beecher was 
ejected early in the second 
period, putting the Wolverines 
on the penalty kill for five 
minutes, regardless of if a goal 
was scored.
Michigan 
allowed 
the 
Buckeyes only one shot, while 
taking two shots of its own 
shorthanded.
Sophomore 
forward 
Garrett Van Wyhe — one of 
the Wolverines’ main penalty 
killers — was ejected late in the 
second, bringing another five-

minute power play for Ohio 
State. This time, the Buckeyes 
managed four shots, but none 
were particularly dangerous 
scoring chances.
“We just knew we had to be 
more composed,” sophomore 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg 
said. “That was the biggest 
thing we talked about was 
we were playing well, and 
we did good things on the 
penalty kill, but we just kinda 
got overextended at times. I 
feel like on Saturday, we were 
kinda a lot more 
compressed 
and 
more 
of 
a 
cohesive 
unit, 
all 
four 
of us working 
together, so I 
feel 
like 
that 
helped 
out 
a 
lot.”
Michigan 
trailed 
throughout 
Saturday’s game, and the two 
major penalties presented an 
opportunity for the Buckeyes 
to fully put the game away. 
Instead, the Wolverines built 
momentum on the kill and 
stayed within a goal until Ohio 
State made it 3-1 with nine 
minutes remaining.
“I think we saw it as an 
opportunity,” 
Mayotte 
said. 
“We felt like it was one of those 
spots where we didn’t like the 
way it was going, whether it 
was on the refs or on us, but an 
opportunity to gain momentum 
and break their will a little bit.
“I think we took it more as, 
‘Let’s be great here and really 

try to demoralize them,’ rather 
than us getting down and 
thinking we have this massive 
challenge ahead of us. Kinda 
put the onus on them to make 
them beat us.”
Mayotte was brought in from 
Providence in the offseason 
in large part to improve the 
Wolverines’ penalty kill. Last 
year, Michigan finished 46th 
of 60 teams with a 78.5 kill 
percentage. The unit Mayotte 
ran with the Friars, meanwhile, 
ranked sixth, killing penalties 
86.6 percent of 
the time.
Just 
about 
three 
quarters 
of 
the 
way 
through 
the 
season, 
the 
Wolverines now 
come in at No. 
17 in the nation 
with 
an 
84 
percent kill rate, 
and 
Michigan 
has started to take ownership 
over Mayotte’s system and find 
its stride on the kill.
“You know what, it has 
the potential to be better,” 
Mayotte said when asked how 
Michigan’s unit stacks up with 
others he’s coached. “... Early 
in the year, it’s me getting 
used to them, them getting 
used to me. Now, instead of — 
you see it with them. They’re 
not thinking, ‘Well, what does 
Mayo want me to do here?’ 
They’re just playing hockey. 
They’re making the reads. 
When you get guys into that 
position, that’s when you’re 
successful.”

Sidor gets confidence boost vs. Iowa

Michigan came out of the 
timeout 
up 
by 
eight 
over 
Iowa. With the massive lead 
that it had built up over 
the first 13 minutes of the 
game dwindling, it needed a 
momentum changer.
Michelle Sidor caught a pass 
at the 3-point line, her space 
disappearing as a defender 
sprinted toward her, briefly 
thought of a shot — and passed.
The 
freshman 
guard’s 
decision to give up an open 
look is the culmination of 
a month-long onslaught of 
missed shots and diminished 
playing time. She’s no longer 
the first player off the bench, 
or even the second. Her last 
points came in a Jan. 12 loss to 
No. 17 Maryland, where she hit 
a single 3-pointer.
Her first Big Ten season has 
taken its toll.
Sidor 
offers 
something 
that 
can 
make 
this 
team 
go from good to great: the 
3-pointer. Whether it’s Sidor, 
junior forward Hailey Brown 
or 
sophomore 
guard 
Amy 
Dilk, Michigan’s offense is 
nearly unstoppable when it 
gets an outside threat. Its 
dismantlings of Penn State 
and Michigan State show how 
when its offense diversifies, 
the sky is the limit.
“A lot of times people try 
to pack the paint on us,” 
sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon said. “But when we 
have the shooters that we have, 
and they’re on and they’re hot, 
it’s really hard to pack the 
paint. You have to get out to 
those shooters, and then when 
you do that, they kick it back 
in.”
Coming into the season, 
Sidor’s shooting ability was 
highly touted and she’s shown 
she’s an impact player in 
spurts, with 16 points against 
Morgan 
State 
and 
seven 
against Syracuse.
Then she started missing. 
She’d 
rush 
her 
shooting 
motion, shots bounced off the 
rim and her defense — still not 
developed — was a liability.

Against the Hawkeyes, one 
of the last players off the bench 
and her main weapon missing, 
Sidor came onto the court. And 
she passed, when she may not 
have earlier this year.
Five seconds later, standing 
in the same spot and no 
defenders 
around 
her, 
she 
received another pass. Iowa’s 
Makenzie Meyer didn’t close 
out and Sidor launched a 
3-pointer, barely any pressure 
in her face.
She nailed it, the bench 
celebrating as she ran back to 
play defense.
The 
next 
possession, 
the 
Hawkeyes 
were forced to 
respect her shot 
and when she 
got the ball, she 
drew out two 
defenders from 
the paint. Sidor 
found Hillmon 
in the vacated 
space, getting an assist.
On Sunday, Sidor was the 
sparkplug Michigan needed 
her to be all season. In just 
over a minute of play, she 
contributed five points. And 
she wasn’t done.
For 
a 
third-straight 
possession, the offense ran 
through Sidor. She gathered a 
pass on the opposite side of the 
arc from her first possession, 
but this time she didn’t need 
an open look to launch a shot.

Her 
confidence 
— 
the 
biggest weapon in the arsenal 
of a shooter — was back. She 
was back.
That’s why Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico pumped 
her fists across the court, why 
the bench celebrated a second 
quarter 3-pointer like a buzzer 
beater. Why, when a stoppage 
of play occurred seconds later, 
chests were thumped in Sidor’s 
direction and everyone patted 
her on the back.
“She was due to hit a couple 
shots,” sophomore guard Amy 
Dilk said. “And 
once 
you 
see 
that first shot 
go in, you keep 
shooting, 
and 
she found two 
really 
good 
looks, and that 
really 
put 
us 
over the edge 
of 
that 
close 
score.”
Freshman 
year is hard, and while Sidor 
has struggled to make an 
impact of late, there’s a reason 
Barnes Arico compared her 
to Katelynn Flaherty before 
the season began. Sidor is a 
shooter, just like Flaherty, and 
even the program’s best-ever 
player struggled her freshman 
year. Perhaps all Sidor needed 
was a boost of confidence to get 
her season back on track, and 
she got that bout of confidence 
Sunday.

2020 TANNER LECTURE ON HUMAN VALUES

Torn apart

Whenever 
Wolverines 
and 
Buckeyes collide, sparks fly — and 
not in a sentimental way. That’s 
to be expected from two bitter 
rivals. 
But 
the 
significance 
of 
Tuesday’s clash between the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team and Ohio State extended 
far beyond any semblance of 
bragging rights for both teams, 
who entered the game tied for 
12th in the Big Ten standings. 
Despite recent two-game win 
streaks, postseason aspirations 
were also on the line. 
Ultimately, behind 23 points 
from their best player, Kaleb 
Wesson, and a controversial 
flagrant foul in the closing 
moments, the Buckeyes (15-7 
overall, 5-6 Big Ten) extended 
their run, beating the Wolverines 
(13-9, 4-7), 61-58. 
A 
sense 
of 
urgency 
characterized the early going as 
both squads looked to jump out 
to hot starts. Instead of catching 
fire, 
though, 
both 
Michigan 
and Ohio State saw a slew of ill-
advised shots clank off the rim. 
Ten minutes into the game and 
the teams had combined for just 
20 points — the Buckeyes holding 
the narrow 13-7 lead.
“I believe we got some really 
good shots that just didn’t go in,” 
freshman forward Franz Wagner 
said. “Had some good looks at the 
rim that we didn’t make. Lack of 
focus maybe, something like that 
hurts in these types of games. You 
need every point.”
Ohio State’s Kaleb Wesson 
was the game’s most potent 
scorer, knocking down fadeaway 
jumpers and 3-pointers in the 
face of the Wolverines’ big 
men. His 15 first-half points 
were counteracted primarily by 
Michigan’s sophomore forward 
Brandon Johns Jr., who led the 
Wolverines with eight points. 
At the end of a largely 

inefficient but industrious first 20 
minutes, where neither team shot 
better than 40 percent from the 
field, Ohio State led by just one.
The shooting woes carried 
over into the second half. In the 
rare case a 3-pointer or layup 
would fall, the other team would 
match it on the other end. At 
the 9:40 mark, both teams were 
knotted up at 38. 
Wesson continued to go to 
work on the Wolverines’ defense 
as the half persisted, though. Now, 
instead of drawing Michigan’s 
bigs out to the perimeter, he was 
bodying them down low. 
“I thought Kaleb was fantastic 
tonight,” Ohio State coach Chris 
Holtmann said. “I thought he 
imposed himself in a lot of ways 
… we thought he was going to be 
able to get some open threes. He 
also made some tough fadeaway 
shots. I think he was just playing 
with a lot of confidence today.”
On the other end, Ohio native 
and senior center Jon Teske 
struggled to get anything going. 
A point-blank miss off an alley-
oop feed from senior point guard 
Zavier 
Simpson 
encapsulated 
his 1-for-7 performance from the 
field.
It was Simpson, though, who 
almost single-handedly carried 
the load for Michigan in the 
second half. With his team down 
by four after yielding yet another 
layup in the paint, Simpson was 
left alone on the wing and hit 
his third 3-pointer of the game. 
Mere seconds later, he finished a 
contested finger roll off an Ohio 
State turnover. 
While Teske proved ineffective, 
senior forward Austin Davis gave 
the Wolverines critical minutes 
down the stretch. He collected 
an offensive rebound and tied 
the game at 51 with four minutes 
remaining, before completing a 
rim-running dive to the basket off 
an assist from Simpson. 
Then, with things all square at 
53, the sparks flew. 
Wesson inched the Buckeyes 
ahead from the foul line. After 

the two teams traded 3-pointers, 
Simpson took matters into his 
own hands — he drove the lane 
and drew a foul on Ohio State’s 
Kyle Young. The ensuing cheers 
from Michigan fans were cut 
short as the referees conferred at 
the monitor and slapped Simpson 
with a flagrant-1 for dragging 
Young down with him after the 
foul. 
“I couldn’t believe it,” Howard 
said. “It was explained like, 
Zavier went up for a layup, and as 
he was coming down, he grabbed 
his jersey and ripped it. And then 
I said ‘Well, if he’s going up and 
he’s falling, did he grab him to 
brace his fall?’ And (the referee) 
said ‘Yes.’ I said, ‘Well, I guess 
that means that you know, he 
needed some help.’ He did not 
want to absorb the contact on that 
momentum of hitting the floor. 
At the end of the day, we have to 
respect their call that was made. 
Unfortunately, I didn’t see it.”
Simpson calmly knocked down 
both from the foul line increasing 
his total 15 points and temporarily 
giving the Wolverines a 58-57 
advantage. 
But 
Young 
immediately 
followed suit on the other end. 
Per the flagrant, the Buckeyes — 
now up by one with 23 seconds 
left 
— 
retained 
possession, 
forcing Michigan to foul again. 
All of a sudden, the one point 
lead that Simpson had earned 
dissolved into a three-point 
deficit. 
On 
the 
Wolverines’ 
final 
possession, Simpson again found 
himself at the center of attention, 
finding junior guard Eli Brooks 
wide open in the corner for a 
last-second chance to tie. 
Just like most of Michigan’s 
3-point looks, it didn’t fall, 
cementing a heartbreaking home 
loss. 
“I’m sure I’m going to replay 
it over and over,” Howard said. 
“It’s a tough one to swallow, I 
swear. This — like all the losses 
— but this one hurts a lot. It was a 
very hard-fought game.”

Michigan loses to Ohio State, 61-58, falls to 4-7 in Big Ten after Simpson commits costly flagrant foul in last minute

For the second time in as 
many games at Crisler Center, 
the game still hung in the 
balance as the clock wound 
down.
After squandering a two-
point lead with less than a 
minute to play against Illinois 
last week, the Michigan men’s 
basketball team (13-9 overall, 
4-7 Big Ten) appeared to find 
its footing. A long-awaited 
road win at Nebraska and 
a successful dispatching of 
Rutgers in New York made 
the loss to the Fighting Illini 
look like an inflection point in 
hindsight. A lesson learned.
But when the Wolverines 
found themselves in a nearly 
identical setting against Ohio 
State on Tuesday night, there 
was no sign of progress. After 
junior guard Eli Brooks gave 
Michigan a two-point lead with 
1:21 left to play, the Buckeyes 
(15-7, 5-6) closed the game on 
a 7-2 run, ultimately escaping 
with a 61-58 win.
In a Big Ten season defined 
by 
conference-wide 
road 
struggles, the Wolverines have 
now dropped their last three 
games in Ann Arbor. All of 
them were there for the taking. 

In the only game Michigan 
didn’t hold a late lead, it was 
down by just five points with 
four minutes to play against 
Penn State on Jan. 22.
The 
most 
recent 
two, 
however, have each come at 
the buzzer. Against Illinois, 
the Wolverines missed five 
consecutive 
free 
throws 
down the stretch in what 
could’ve been a win over the 
conference’s 
hottest 
team, 
culminating in 
Ayo Dosunmu’s 
eventual game-
winning pull-up 
jumper.
Tuesday 
proved to be a 
different story, 
though, 
as 
Michigan 
was 
the team with 
the ball as the 
clock 
ticked 
down 
in 
a 
one-possession 
game. 
With 
over 
39 
grueling 
minutes of physical basketball 
already 
in 
the 
books, 
Juwan Howard huddled the 
Wolverines 
around 
their 
bench. He spent back-to-back 
timeouts furiously scribbling 
and pointing, whiteboard and 
marker in hand the entire time.
The result was an open look 
for Brooks from the left corner. 

A look that Brooks had buried 
from the opposite corner less 
than two minutes prior. A look 
that would’ve tied the game.
A 
look 
that 
ultimately 
clanked off the back iron.
“We were in the game the 
whole game,” freshman wing 
Franz 
Wagner 
said. 
“We 
didn’t play exceptionally well. 
Sometimes that just happens, 
but you’ve got to be able to still 
win the game, especially at 
home. It hurts a 
lot.”
Especially 
at home. Those 
words 
brought 
the most strain 
to his voice.
Over 
the 
last few weeks, 
home is where 
the Wolverines 
have struggled 
most. 
From 
knowing the arena lighting 
and practicing on the rims 
daily, there are a number of 
advantages to playing at home. 
Yet during this three-game 
losing streak at Crisler Center, 
Michigan hasn’t shot above 40 
percent in a single game.
And 
even 
though 
open 
looks aren’t falling, Howard’s 
unwavering 
green 
light 
persists.
At this point, it’s difficult 
for anyone in the Wolverines’ 
locker room to put a finger 
on the root of the problem. 
Slumped against the wall in a 
scrum of reporters following 
the game, Wagner tried to 
gauge the situation.
“I think we got some really 
good shots that didn’t go in,” 
Wagner said. “We got some 
good shots at the rim we didn’t 
make. Lack of focus maybe — 
I don’t know. Stuff like that 
hurts in these types of games. 
You need every point.”
With its last two losses 
coming at the final buzzer, 
Michigan has learned that 
final lesson the hard way.

Missed shots a familiar refrain

For 
all 
the 
romanticized 
and clichéd reasons to love 
sports, seeing a buzzer-beating 
3-pointer hit nothing but net has 
to be near the top of the list. It’s 
pure anticipation as the shooter 
pulls up and attempts to carve 
themselves in the history books 
of their program.
That’s the exact opportunity 
junior guard Eli Brooks had in 
the waning moments on Tuesday 
against Ohio State.
As 
each 
second 
escaped 
forever 
off 
the 
clock, 
the 
Wolverines were running one 
final play to tie the game and 
salvage a win at Crisler Center. 
Like most late-game scenarios, 
senior guard Zavier Simpson 
drove to the basket where he 
looked to find the open shooter.
There sat Brooks, alone in 
the corner with his defender 
desperately trying to get in 
position to make the stop. The 
junior caught the ball, rose up as 
he has done thousands of times 
and … the ball clanged off the 
back rim. 
Michigan got the look it 
wanted — a wide-open shot in 
the corner from one of its best 
shooters — and just flat out 
missed it, giving Ohio State a 
61-58 win.
So why didn’t it go in?
Not only that, why didn’t all of 
the Wolverines’ wide-open shots 
find nylon? Michigan’s shooters 
consistently found themselves 
staring at an unobstructed view 
of the basket in its entirety — a 
bright green light screaming at 
the ball handler to let it fly.
This 
tendency 
has 
done 
nothing but grow under coach 
Juwan Howard, whose policy 
since Day One has been: If you’re 
open, make it rain.
Unfortunately 
for 
the 
Wolverines, 
there’s 
been 
a 
drought in Ann Arbor.
“I know we missed a ton 
of layups,” Howard said. “We 
missed a ton of open shots. 
We just have to finish, it’s that 
simple. We have to finish games. 
We have to win games at home. 
We started off with a pretty 
good run in the beginning of the 

season by winning some home 
games, and our first loss ended 
up being against Oregon, but 
we haven’t gotten back to that 
basketball that we were playing 
in the beginning of the year.”
Perhaps no one player has 
struggled more to hit open looks 
than freshman forward Franz 
Wagner. 
Tuesday, the freshman went 
just 2-for-8 from 3-point range 
and 2-for-12 from the floor. That’s 
good for a 25 percent 3-point 
percentage — a disappointing 
mark to say the least.
But the German will be the first 
to tell you that these misfires are 
not the result of a mental hurdle 
needing to be conquered. Often 
times, pundits and onlookers 
alike suggest this could be the 
reason for a shooting drought. If 
a player is not shooting well, the 
thinking goes, they just must not 
be shooting confidently.
“It’s not, ‘I’m goin’ bad, I need 
to fix my shot,’ ” Wagner said. 
“I’m confident in my shot, I think 
you can see that. I’ll continue 
to do that. We got good shots. A 
couple shots felt really good, but 
they didn’t go in. Sometimes my 
wrist doesn’t flex in the direction 
I want it to, so that’s why you 
gotta keep working on it, but it’s 
not that I’m not confident.”
Rather, it could boil down to 
slight alterations in how the ball 
leaves his hands.
After a win against Nebraska 
on Jan. 28, Wagner — who had 
just gone 1-for-5 from beyond the 
arc — assured the public that the 
coaching staff insisted there was 
nothing 
mechanically 
wrong 
with his shot. The dang thing 

just needed to fall in the hoop.
“I talked to the coaches, and 
we think there’s nothing wrong 
with my shot,” Wagner said in 
Lincoln. “We’re just gonna keep 
working on it, and you can ask 
anybody. I’m trying to work on 
it and get my reps up, during the 
game and just trust it and believe 
that it’s going in.”
So how does Wagner address 
this problem in practice?
He does not attempt to correct 
the trajectory of his previous 
miss. Say he’s too strong on one 
of his shots and the ball pops 
off the back of the rim. Instead 
of attempting to put less muscle 
on his shot, Wagner holds fast in 
his approach, refusing to cave to 
the pressure that he overcorrect 
the amount of force put into the 
shot. The opposite is true for 
balls that fall just short of the 
basket.
Given 
the 
secrecy 
that 
typically 
surrounds 
players 
shooting mechanics, Wagner’s 
approach may be unique among 
his teammates.
But for someone shooting 
under 30 percent from 3-point 
land while attempting five long-
range bombs a game, a change to 
his shooting mechanics in some 
form may be on the horizon. 
Either 
that, 
or 
Wagner’s 
persistence pays off and open 
looks may no longer be a gaping 
hole in Michigan’s offensive 
inefficiencies.
Because if a team can’t figure 
out the little things in a wide-
open shot over the course of a 
regulation game, how could it be 
expected to hit it with the game 
on the line?

N

o good college seduction routine 
would be complete without a 
pre-coital ideological disagree-
ment. One October night, I cozied into 
the well-decorated attic of a friend who 
serenaded me by playing the bass before 
broaching the topic of conscription, a sub-
ject which, until recently, seemed largely 
obsolete in the post-interstate-war world. 
He said to me that being forced to sign up 
for the draft when he turned 18 seemed 
like a good system: While he otherwise 
would not have, he felt if the country called 
on him to go to war, he would do so gladly. 
I pressed him about the causes for which 
he would be willing to fight violently and 
he could list none. Blind acceptance of the 
country’s demands — for which we are 
offered no justification — reveals that we 
are overdue for a paradigm shift in the per-
ception of the value we carry for our coun-
try and our world. 
For many, the choice to serve in the mil-
itary is born of fiscal need: Students and 
young people from lower socioeconomic 
statuses put their own Americanist ideals 
of individualism on hold while they serve 
their the country. In the armed forces, 
they exchange their time — and poten-
tially their lives — for future fiscal spon-
sorship to attend college or own a home. 
For many, education and property are pipe 
dreams that make the military compelling 
or necessary. At my former public high 
school where matriculation rates were 
low, it was common to see my peers sign 
up for military service. Recruiters from 
the Army, Air Force and Navy stationed 
tables around our cafeteria for weeks on 
end. They selected students to do pull-ups 
on the bars and rewarded them with glam-
orous pamphlets of honor and glory. 
Those peers of mine who did not have 
the opportunity to go to college — due pri-
marily to financial limitations — had to lis-
ten quietly while the rest of us talked about 
our futures. While I and others planned to 
go to college and daydreamed about the 
careers we would pursue, others in my 
class prepared nothing beyond graduation. 
When they emotionlessly chose to join the 

armed forces, I wondered 
if it was a choice at all. If 
all options were equally 
available to each of us, 
how many would choose 
to endure the hardships of 
military service. Knowing 
that the resources spent 
on defense could instead 
provide for the education 
of America’s young people, 
the coercion underlying 
military servitude becomes 
evident. If a choice is made 
with coercion, is it really a 
choice?
Suppose, in examining 
the justice of conscription, 
we exclude those who have 
been coerced into service. 
I have to imagine for all 
those who are coerced in 
some manner to join the 
military, there exists a sig-
nificant number who join 
not from need, but from 
desire. Some feel indebted 
to the public services the 
country has provided. In 
looking to reciprocate all 
they’ve been given by the 
nation, many turn to offer 
themselves to it, believing that 
if they must give up their lives so that the 
country can persist, it will be the least they 
could offer. I have respect for veterans and 
understand the inclination to give our-
selves in servitude. Those willing to make 
the ultimate sacrifice for their country and 
its people deserve, in fact, to be treated far 
better by that country than they are. 
But what if the country made no such 
demands on its people? What if, instead, 
the way we served a country was by serv-
ing its people? What if we were not asked 
to lay down our lives, but simply to live 
them to their fullest — leaving behind 
contributions to the nation in the form of 
ideas, families, art or scientific discover-
ies? What if the country called upon us 
to contribute daily to causes beyond our-

selves? And what if the value of our lives 
was not measured in their cessation? That 
is to say: Can’t the country respect our 
potential contributions without robbing us 
of our chance to fulfill them? A painting, 
the creation of a new vaccine, the cleaning 
of a national park or the teaching of young 
people are each productive contributions 
one could provide, or value, in the nation. 
Recently, a Swiss friend came to visit me 
and laughed about his trip being made pos-
sible by his exemption from the required 
military service he would otherwise 
have to enlist in. I scoffed. Switzerland 
is known for its neutrality! In what army 
would all of its young people serve? They 
had a choice, he told me, between milita-
rism and civil services: Two years in the 

military could be exchanged for lifelong, 
occasional assistance on fire services, 
flood damage repairs and other emergency 
responses to natural disasters. His choice 
of civil service provision should have been 
obvious. “I mean, can you picture me hold-
ing a gun?”
Conscription is, by accident or force of 
habit, a topic of conversation I often have 
with my friends from around the globe, 
one which has shown me how non-ubiq-
uitously the armed forces are approached 
in distinct nations of the world. Refram-
ing the notion of servitude to focus on the 
ways we create and care for one another 
each day is nothing more than a respect 
for life from our nation to us, just as we’re 
promised.

Making new sacrifices for our

I

t was Friday, Jan. 24. I was laying 
in my bed, only awake because of 
the sunlight streaming in through 
my dorm window. After a while, I 
decided it was time to finally get up, so 
I rolled over and reached for my phone 
sitting atop my desk. A calendar event 
notification topped the screen. 
It read: “Tomorrow, Lunar New 
Year.” 
My 
family 
has 
always 
loosely 
followed typical Lunar New Year 
traditions. We have a straightforward 
way of celebrating: We clean to get 
rid of any bad luck and make space for 
good luck. My brother and I receive 
red envelopes from relatives, usually 
sent in the mail or as electronic money 
transfers. My mom cooks us dinner, 
supplementing our meal with a few 
boxes of take-out from the dim sum 
restaurant and an order of noodles from 
our favorite Vietnamese place. “This is 
for longevity,” my mom always said. 
We’ve never had a big family reunion 
dinner like we’re supposed to in order 
to celebrate the holiday. Traditionally, 
the New Year dinner is special, mainly 
because it’s a big occasion for families 
to reunite with family members who 
live far from home. It’s supposed to be 
an intimate setting; families sit around 
the table for hours catching up with 
relatives they don’t often see. Normally, 
the food is entirely home-cooked, 
and there are often fireworks later in 
the night. For my family, there are no 
fireworks, and dinner is usually just 
the four of us — my parents, my brother 
and myself. A “reunion” with our other 
family members is usually out of the 
picture as most of our extended family 
lives in the Philippines. 
Regardless of how small or simple or 
unconventional my family’s Lunar New 
Year activities have been, it’s always felt 
like a tradition for me, made even more 
special because it’s a time of closeness 
with my immediate family. On this one 
particular day every year, it’s what I’m 
used to. 
As I stared down at my phone screen 
alerting me of the upcoming holiday, 
I knew there was nothing traditional 
about how I’d be celebrating this Lunar 
New Year. It’d be the first one I’d spend 
away from home. For the first time, I 
wouldn’t be cleaning with my family. 
I wouldn’t be comparing red envelope 
money with my brother. I wouldn’t be 
sitting at the dinner table among plates 

and trays of noodles. I would be alone, 
hours away from any of them. 
This realization stuck with me 
as my day went on. I couldn’t 
stop thinking about it, and 
the event on my phone 
calendar kept the thought 
of the Lunar New Year 
in the back of my head. 
Remembering all the 
things I’d miss doing 
with 
my 
family 
brought 
back 
a 
wave of nostalgia 
and 
yearning 
that 
I 
hadn’t 
prepared for. I 
was left feeling 
homesick 
on 
the 
holiday 
during 
which 
I was meant to 
be surrounded 
by those I love 
and those who 
love me. 
Of 
course, 
it’s not like Ann 
Arbor is completely 
devoid 
of 
any 
Lunar 
New 
Year 
celebrations. 
There 
were 
various 
Lunar 
New 
Year 
celebrations 
being held across campus 
that weekend — the Chinese 
department was holding an event 
that Friday afternoon and a couple 
of student organizations were holding 
events on the actual holiday. After 
looking through a couple of the flyers 
and invitations online though, I decided 
not to attend any of these events. The 
idea of going to them felt weird. They 
couldn’t offer what I was used to. The 
Lunar New Year is a holiday that has 
become deeply personal to me — so 
simply going to a substitute event felt 
too removed. 
Ignoring the Lunar New Year entirely 
wasn’t an option either, because that 
felt strange, too. If I did that, I felt 
like I was letting go of the tradition of 
celebrating entirely, something I wasn’t 
prepared to do. 
Even if I wasn’t spending the New 
Year with my family, I still wanted to 
celebrate it. I’d just celebrate it in my 
own new way. 
Instead, on the first day of the Lunar 
New Year, I convinced three of my 

friends 
to 
go 
out for dinner to eat 
ramen on State Street, with my 
mother’s words about noodles and 
longevity swimming around in the 
back of my mind. Once we arrived at 
the restaurant, it was clear I wasn’t 
the only one who had this idea. It was 
packed, and the waiter informed us it 
would most likely be a 45-minute wait. 
At that, my friends turned to me, 
looked at me as if to ask, “Well?” 
It was up to me. 
“I want noodles,” I said.
In the end, I did get the noodles 
I wanted. The steam from my bowl 
of ramen fogged my glasses as I sat 
at a table of four, surrounded by my 
friends. For a moment, I thought about 
my parents and brother back home. I 
thought about the cleaning, the red 

envelopes and the family dinners. 
Then, I looked down at my noodles and 
figured that I was definitely going to be 
OK, even if I wasn’t spending the Lunar 
New Year with my family. Even when 
I’m separated from them, I can still 
practice and experience little pieces of 
the traditions we’d created. 
As a freshman in college, I’ve slowly 
been learning that this is something 
that I’m going to have to get used to. The 
Lunar New Year isn’t the only occasion 
I’ll spend away from my family. As 
students 
moving 
away 
from 
our 
childhood homes, we naturally grow 
into more independent lives: Learning 
to create our own traditions is simply a 
part of the process of growing up.

Dining alone, or maybe not

n the 1970s and ’80s, most major 
United States orchestras changed 
their audition policies in an attempt 
to eliminate their bias toward hiring male 
candidates. The new procedures included 
advertising the positions more widely, 
restructuring admissions committees to 
also include members of the orchestra 
and most importantly, the introduction of 
“blind” or “screen” auditions in which the 
identity of the player was hidden from the 
jury.
By doing this, they increased female 
representation from 10 percent in the 
early 1970s to 35 percent in the mid-1990s. 
The screen, meant to address gender 
discrimination within the hiring process 
of orchestras, had allegedly achieved its 
purpose. But as they gained representation, 
women musicians who were auditioning 
for orchestras also lost something: their 
right to perform gender and to own and 
show their bodies in the ways they pleased.
Anne 
Phillips, 
London 
School 
of 
Economics Gender and Theory professor, 
argues in her book, “The Politics of the 
Human”, that women had to become 
“disembodied abstractions” in order to be 
considered as musicians of equal merit to 
their male counterparts. 
Phillips’s 
notion 
of 
disembodied 
abstractions stuck with me, because it 
suggests that women need to surrender 
their bodies to claim their equal place in 
the world. To be considered as humans, 
we would need to give up the gendered 
particularities that make us women. 
As I paged through “The Politics of 
the Human”, all I could think about was 
my body: my brown hair, flexible legs, 
uncoordinated arms and face. It looks 
different from any other body I’ve ever 
seen. It shapes how I see and experience the 
world, and also affects how others see me. 
It is a woman’s body. It is an immigrant’s 
body. It is a body that carries stress and 
grief, but also happiness.
In a lot of ways, my body makes me 
who I am. Was it possible for me to think 
of myself, a human and a woman, without 
considering the particularities of my body?
For me, the answer was no. 
The more I read, the more I came 
to understand that Phillips’s feminist 
argument was based on something much 
deeper than equal gender representation 
for musicians in orchestras. Although 
representation is an important step in 
achieving equality, Phillips was attempting 

to attack the problem at its root. In her 
view, the origin of gender inequality does 
not come from simply from genitalia. 
It can be explained, at its core, by the 
essence of personhood. 
“We make up people,” she writes in “The 
Politics of the Human”. “When we decide 
that the crucial distinction is that between 
a man and a woman, or human and animal, 
or heterosexual and gay, we settle on 
definitions and boundaries that then mark 
our ways of thinking and living.”
So, if women musicians auditioning 
for orchestras in the U.S. were forced to 
surrender their bodies to be considered 
worthy of a position, then what does that 
say about their status as people?
T

he United Nations proclaimed 
the 
Universal 
Declaration 
of 
Human Rights in 1948 aiming to 
protect the universal human rights of all 
people on Earth. It was, according to them, 
a groundbreaking moment that marked a 
milestone in the fight for human rights. 
For the first time, they say, all people 
were recognized as having a personhood 
worth protecting, no matter what their 
nationality was. For the first time, there 
was a governing body whose goal was to 
see everyone and prevent them from being 
acted against, no matter their societal 
status.
Article 2 of the UDHR reads like this:
“Everyone is entitled to all the rights 
and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, 
without distinction of any kind, such 
as race, colour, sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth or other status. 
Furthermore, no distinction shall be made 
on the basis of the political, jurisdictional 
or international status of the country 
or territory to which a person belongs, 
whether it be independent, trust, non-self-
governing or under any other limitation of 
sovereignty.”
All is well and good, until one realizes 
that the word gender does not make the cut 
for the “distinctions of any kind” protected 
by the UDHR. Sex is there, but the contrast 
between the two is an important one. 
Sex is a biological state, it is a non-binary 
designation of male or female based on 
sex organs. Gender is the attributes and 
behaviors that are socially assigned to sex 
categories. It is also non-binary, and there 
is no assumed correspondence between 
gender and sex. The two are undeniably 
linked for some people, but irrevocably 

disjointed for others. 
I

n her book, “Inventing Human 
Rights”, University of California, Los 
Angeles history professor Lynn Hunt 
argues that human rights are given under 
three distinctions only.
“Human rights require three interlocking 
qualities: rights must be natural (inherent 
in human beings); equal (the same for 
everyone); 
and 
universal 
(applicable 
everywhere),” Hunt writes.
But as the women musicians showed, 
our categorical human looks a very specific 
way and not everyone is protected equally 
within their societies, or by the UDHR. In 
fact, I would argue people are placed into 

categories based on the particularities of 
their bodies, and this affects the degree of 
protection they receive.
The women auditioning behind the 
screen became “disembodied abstractions” 
because their bodies looked different than 
those of the male players. Their bodies were 
different, and the attributes and behaviors 
associated with their female bodies — their 
gender — clearly showed. For example, 
despite knowing they would play behind a 
screen, women musicians who auditioned 
for orchestras still dressed for the occasion 
and often wore heels.
Phillips writes that representation of 
women rose further when a carpet was 

added to disguise the sound of women 
players walking across the stage. She 
further states blind selection and screen 
auditions as “an indictment of the nature of 
our prejudices.”
It is — the forced distinction between 
gendered bodies places us on a balance 
that often tips toward cisgender men. The 
screen may have increased representation, 
but it also enhanced gender as an innate 
difference and did little to address the root 
problem of gender discrimination.
Being placed behind a screen forces 
people to assert their humanity through 
factors other than their bodies, which play 
a key part on how they view themselves.
The screen demonstrates 
that the fullness of women, 
their gender performance, 
identities 
and 
physical 

attributes — their humanity — could not 
be on the stage. They had to be considered 
only on one aspect, their musical abilities, 
but they could not be accepted on their 
assertion of personhood. 
In other words, the women who played 
behind a curtain were not being considered 
as people because of the way they showed 
up in the world and how they chose to 
adorn and portray their bodies. 
T

he way our society categorizes 
personhood is ascribed in these 
so-called solutions to inequality 
and discrimination. “Blind” or “screen” 
auditions inadvertently categorized women 
as “lesser than” by forcing them to hide 
their bodies and identities in the same way 
Article 2 of the UDHR completely ignored 
gender and failed to protect those whose 
sex organs don’t necessarily dictate their 

identities.
Liv Naimi (they/them), an LSA senior 
studying 
social 
theory 
and 
practice 
commented on the potential harmful 
nature of these exclusions.
“When it is women being discriminated 
against in (orchestras), that is interesting, 
because they are being discriminated 
against for the way they are showing up in 
the world,” they said.
“There is a lot of beauty in (their 
identities), and a lot of parts of themselves 
that they don’t get to show when they have 
to hide behind a curtain. They could still 
(play), and it could be really good, but I 
think that it says a lot to take away the 
outside of yourself. It says a lot about how 
other people can’t take all of you in and 
about why you can’t be yourself, and it can 
be really harmful.”
Naimi argued that the way we show up 
and present ourselves matters because it is 
a choice.
“My queer and also, at times, gender 
identity are things that I could hide if I 
wanted to,” they said. “But the opportunity 
to show them matters a lot to me, because 
they change the way that I can show up and 
be understood in space, and they change 
the way that I feel authentic.”
They also stated that language matters 
in recognizing someone’s personhood.
“When someone looks at me and uses 
‘she’ pronouns, I get why. The culture we 
live in automatically genders the shape of 
my body. But being misunderstood in this 
way is harmful, because I am not being 
seen as how I feel,” they said. 
“I do enjoy femininity somedays, and 
looking like I would like to involves many 
steps. What I want changes. It’s not that 
I am not human when people see me as a 
woman, but it is that I am not the specific 
and unique human that I am. I am not me 
to them,” Naimi added.
The metaphorical screen being built 
around people whose gender identities 
do not conform to our normative idea of 
personhood can be harmful and, despite 
increasing representation, it can lead to the 
vindication of difference and to a lack of 
understanding and empathy across gender.
Andrew Miller (he/him), an LSA senior 
studying film, television, and media had a 
similar opinion.
“(Being put behind a curtain) sounds 
like a scary proposition,” he said. “It is 
hard, because when it comes to art, you 
want the best product to be shown; but 

when it comes to humans, you want people 
to like you and for there to not be that much 
hidden about you.”
Miller 
said 
the 
ability 
to 
be 
recognized holistically matters and that 
compartmentalizing the self could lead to 
ingenuine interaction.
“I want people to like me for everything 
about me. I want people to see me. In an 
ideal world, I would like to think that my 
character would really speak for itself, but 
I’d like everything I can to be upfront and 
present.”
Miller also said he believes that if art 
is left to what he called a “free market 
ideology,” gender and race discrepancies 
in terms or representation and acceptance 
will always exist.
“There’s 
a 
whole 
movement 
in 
Hollywood that put more minorities and 
women into films,” he said. “I don’t know 
if (representation) would fix the problem. I 
think if you gave people who are different 
and who have different experiences a 
chance to tell their own stories, instead of 
just inserting them like paste into films, 
that would be very interesting.”
Both Naimi and Miller agreed in 
saying that the UDHR’s exclusion of 
gender is important and can lead to 
misunderstanding about the difference 
between gender and sex. They also agreed 
in believing that the right to express gender 
freely should be protected as its own entity.
W

henever I walk into a room, I 
am aware of the particularities 
of my body. I know that the 
makeup on my face and my long hair are the 
normative symbols recognizable to others 
as femininity. “I feel like a woman,” these 
features say. “This is who I am.”
I know that one day, I will inevitably 
be asked to go behind a metaphorical 
screen to attain equal status to my male 
counterparts. I know that every day, even 
now, as I write this, people are forced to go 
behind a screen because of their gender. 
It is not representation that we need, it 
is empathy. We need to recognize gender 
performance as a human right, and all 
gendered bodies as people first.

The girl with the plant tattoo

A

s I enter the second semester of my senior 
year of college, I’ve found that one of the 
most wonderful parts of this era of life is the 
evenings spent on friends’ couches drinking wine, 
surrounded by people I’ve grown close to over the past 
years. As the chaos, deadlines, anxiety of forming new 
bonds and all the noise of the first few years of college 
die down, this stage of life feels like a comfortable, 
much-needed settling in.
During one of these evenings, this time in the form 
of a book club, friends I’ve known since week one of 
college and we found ourselves reflecting on how we’ve 
changed from those wide-eyed freshmen carting their 
belongings up to South Quad Residence Hall’s dorm 
rooms almost four years ago, to the seniors now sitting 
around with mugs of wine, discussing our favorite 
books of the moment, collectively playing adults. 
Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about this 
evolution, which is perhaps a natural consequence of 
being toward the end of a major phase of life and on 
the cusp of something different and unknown. I’ve 
been comparing the image of myself now to the girl 
who showed up on campus in what feels like another 
lifetime — a girl who seems worlds removed from the 
person I am today. 
As much as I try to conceptualize how I’ve changed, 
the physical changes tend to feel the easiest to focus on. 
I now have bangs and a nose ring. I dress differently — 
wearing more thrifted sweaters and big earrings. I’ve 
certainly learned not to shy away from stereotypes, 
leaning more and more into the vaguely-artsy liberal 
college student persona as each year of college passes.
But bangs can grow out, nose piercings can close up 

and clothes can be donated to Goodwill. There’s one 
change, however, that’s going to be a bit more difficult 
to leave behind — the tattoo inked onto the skin above 
my left rib cage.
The tattoo — four sprigs of herbs, all in a row 
— didn’t feel like a big deal to get at the time. This 
is strange, as my mother had spent years warning 
me about the permanence of tattoos, and I’d spent 
the same amount of time believing I would never 
get one. I don’t know myself well enough for that, I 
would think. I reasoned: Very few people really know 
themselves that well, right? Those who say they do 
are usually only kidding themselves. These people 
will grow, change and look back at the ink on their 
bodies with regret. They’ll realize their tattoo doesn’t 
represent who they are anymore and have to live the 
rest of their lives in a body that’s untrue to the person 
they’ve become.
Yet, 
despite 
all 
this 
thoroughly 
thought-out 
reasoning, in mid-November of last year, I decided to 
hell with all that. I’d had a spark of inspiration the night 
before, and less than 24 hours later, walked out of Name 
Brand Tattoo with a patch covering the smarting, red 
skin on my left rib cage, freshly emblazoned with four 
herbs in a row: parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme. I’d 
been raised on Simon and Garfunkel, and this visual 
representation of my favorite album of theirs felt right. 
It was generically pretty, yet still felt personal, like a 
piece of my identity projected upon the surface of my 
body.
I don’t know when I stopped taking tattoos less 
seriously. Maybe it was an aftereffect of seeing so 
many people around me sport ink casually, a form of 

adornment once edgy and taboo now making 
its way into the cultural mainstream. 
But my shift in opinion was also a more 
fundamental change than that: it was the 
result of watching myself change over the past 
years of my life. I’d realized — through years 
of friendships that waxed and waned, passing 
relationships and countless reinventions of 
myself — that the person I am is never going 
to be a fixed entity, and that the skin I walk 
around in is never going to carry the same 
person from day to day. 
When I first came to college, if I got a 
tattoo, it probably would have been something 
stereotypically Californian. During that 
stage of my life, I was living away from home 
for the first time and being from California 
felt like the most fundamental part of my 
identity. A year ago, when I was studying 
abroad in Paris, I mused over getting my 
favorite French artist’s work inked into my 
skin. So really, it was just an accident of time 
that my first tattoo ended up being a tribute 
to folk music. 
And while my constantly changing sense of 
self-perception might seem a reason to never 
get a tattoo, it ended up being the reason 
I got one. I can feel myself changing and 
evolving with every passing semester and life 
experience. This feels wonderful and needed 
and exciting, but I also don’t want to forget 
who I am now, at 21. I don’t want to forget 
what feels important to me right now, at this 
moment — so much so that I want it etched 
on my skin. 
As I’m on the verge of leaving college, I realize that 
a few years down the road I might not even like Simon 
and Garfunkel. The herbs on my side could feel like a 
cliché, a byproduct of an era where every other woman 
I meet seems to have some form of flora inked on her 
body. 
But I’m OK with that, because 10, 20 or 30 years 
in the future, I’ll have this reminder of what 21 was 
like. I’ll remember what it was like to be a senior in 
college and walk through the snow and ice of Michigan 
winter listening to “Cloudy” and “A Simple Desultory 
Philippic,” thinking about my home in California and 
my home in Michigan and all the ups and downs this 
music has carried me through.
At this particular moment in time, more than 
ever before, I’m realizing just how much I’m a 
conglomeration of all the different things and people 
that have felt most important to me during the stages 
of my life, constantly building upon past versions of 
myself to present some cohesive image to the outside 
world. 
Of course, that image isn’t ever going to align 
completely or comprehensively with how I perceive 
myself or how I want to be perceived, but maybe that’s 
OK. By commemorating moments and feelings on my 
skin and attempting to chronicle versions of my past 
self, I’m holding on to some building block of the person 
I’m becoming. I recognize that the person I am now — 
one who is coming upon the end of her college career 
— is only going to stick around in her current form for 
so long. But I embrace that person, and her particular 
affinity for Simon and Garfunkel, all the same.

I 

finished the book “Make Trouble” 
by Planned Parenthood president 
Cecile Richards on a flight back to 
Ann Arbor from my hometown in New 
Jersey. As I closed the back cover of a 
memoir following Richards’s rise in the 
ranks from seven-year-old daughter of 
politician Ann Richards to president of 
Planned Parenthood, I began to cry. 
I was overwhelmingly fervent about 
women’s reproductive rights prior to 
stumbling upon the memoir, but with the 
closing remarks of the book, I felt tears 
prick suddenly at my eyes. I equated the 
emotion to being moved fiercely by a 
woman who is dedicating her whole life 
to fighting for equality and choice. I was 
met with an incredible awareness of my 
potential place in the fight — perhaps like 
Richards once experienced. Her story of 
working from young, punchy activist to 
president of an esteemed nonprofit ignit-
ed a hunger in me. If one woman could 

have such a relevant stake in 
fighting for what she believes 
in and stimulating progress, 
there must be a way I could do 
the same for my own beliefs. 
Advocating for reproduc-
tive rights, gender equality 
and women’s empowerment 
is intrinsic to me in a way 
that I feel in my bones. I 
want to share that message, 
and explore its implications. 
For me, this amounts to my 
words — my writing. It has 
become important to me that 
I can explore these topics in 
the lines of my articles, plays 
and poetry in order to open a 
dialogue between myself and, 
hopefully, my readers and 
peers.
Surrounding myself with 
friends 
and 
acquaintances 
who share my views on wom-
en’s rights and other hotbed 
social-political policies is not 
difficult on a campus like the 
University of Michigan. In 
2017, after the divisive election 
season and Trump’s inaugura-
tion, the Freshman Survey, a 
survey run by UCLA’s Higher 
Education 
Research 
Insti-
tute, stratified and released 
results on students’ political 
affiliation per University. They 
found that 34.1 percent of U-M 
students identified as middle 
of the road politically, 43.7 
percent identified as liberals 
and 15.4 percent identified as 
conservative. In comparison 
to previous years, the number 
of left-leaning students on campus in 2017 
had grown. 
I never thought much about the polar-
ity between political parties until I was a 
freshman. The climate in my hometown, 
Rumson, New Jersey, is relatively even 
split and slightly right leaning. I did not 
witness much animosity between parties 
growing up: 52.5 percent of Rumson resi-
dents voted Republican in the last elec-
tion and 43.2 percent voted Democrat. 
On Michigan’s campus, and specifically 
in 2016 when I arrived as a freshman, I 
realized that politics are divisive and 
significant, being a consistently popular, 
important topic of conversation. Some-
thing that was never immediately relevant 
to me — bipartisanship, animosity over 
political affiliation and alignment — sud-
denly became meaningful in my life. Upon 
President Trump’s inauguration, the crip-
pling political polarity both on campus 
and nationally showed its face. Amiable 

bipartisanism seemed further away from 
us than ever. 
When I began to date someone I quickly 
learned was Republican, I initially didn’t 
give much importance to the probable dif-
ferences in our political values. In fact, 
we didn’t talk politics often — almost as 
if to avoid confrontation. It’s easier to be 
agreeable in conversation and avoid antip-
athy than to challenge someone, especial-
ly in the early stages of a relationship. We 
dated for a year, edging on political debate 
a few times, only to extinguish the conver-
sations if they neared argumentative, as if 
we both feared we’d squander the chance 
at our happy relationship if we revealed 
our startling polarity on social-political 
policy and news bites. 
Finally, near nine months into our rela-
tionship, I wanted to hear out loud what I 
already knew was true: I asked if he was 
pro-life or pro-choice — a simple ques-
tion. I knew what he’d say before he said 
it, and he was aware of my zeal regarding 
reproductive rights. We’d been awkward-
ly shielding the truth of our viewpoints 
instead of allowing the other to see what 
the other believed. 
I don’t care for his opinion, and I do not 
agree with it, but that doesn’t make his 
having it invalid. His contrasting view-
point, or his being pro-life, doesn’t make 
him a bad person. It doesn’t make him a 
monster, it doesn’t make him cruel, or hor-
rible. It makes him a human being with 
an opinion, just as I am. We were simply 
two mutually respectful individuals with 
deeply different moral values. 
We both had our feet firmly planted 
on either side of so many issues: gun con-
trol, abortion and the Colorado baker who 
refused a wedding cake to a gay couple. 
Political polarity couldn’t break us up — or 
could it? 
Our political affiliation wasn’t the rea-
son for the relationship’s demise. But what 
did end the relationship was a stark differ-
ence in moral values and personal ethics 
— something closely tied to the heart and 
at core of the aforementioned issues. Since 
handling the disagreement on the basis 
of so many political issues with a serious 
significant other, I’ve been wondering 
about bipartisan relationships in 2020. As 
we near another intense election season, 
I kept asking myself: Can millennials/Gen 
Zers date over party lines? Do we even 
want to? 
I never personally anticipated some-
one’s political affiliation would influence 
my relationship with them, either roman-
tic or otherwise, unless their opinions 
were severe or hateful. Upon explicitly 
conversing about politics with the ex-boy-
friend who stood on the complete opposite 
end as I do on social issues, I recognized 

perhaps I have a threshold of tolerance, in 
regards to social politics, when it comes 
to the political ideology of my significant 
others.
I put out a poll on my Instagram 
story –– a quick, efficient way to gauge 
ideas on the topics from acquaintances, 
friends and strangers who fall in the 16 
to 24 age range — and was impressed by 
the 300 responses I received. Most of the 
respondents were middle-class, Cauca-
sian females, leaving about 33 percent of 
the respondents as male. 
I am aware that the results of this poll 
cannot be fully relied on as any concrete 
data, as it is a biased sample from only my 
Instagram followers who participated. I 
am aware that different communities may 
have varied reactions to the same ques-
tions asked, therefore, it is necessary to 
keep in mind that the survey merely dis-
closed the opinion of the group of peers I 
have myself. That being said, the results 
provide an interesting look into the minds 
of my peers. 
I asked a series of questions, all with the 
intention of uncovering my peers’ dating 
experience among party lines. The first 
“would you date someone with extreme, 
absolute opposing political views from 
your own?” received 244 answers for no, 
and 69 answers for yes. This means about 
80 percent of the participants stated 
they wouldn’t be interested in involve-
ment with someone romantically of their 
opposing political opinion. 
When asked if they would be open to 
dating someone with extremely different 
social-political values, 235 people said no, 
and 78 people said yes. Conversely, to the 
question “would you date someone with 
extremely different fiscal political val-
ues?” 106 people said no, and 207 people 
said yes. The overwhelming majority are 
willing to write off fiscal political differ-
ences, yet would be uninterested on the 
basis of social-political differences. 
One of my final questions asked if poli-
tics are a relationship dealbreaker, broad-
ly, to which 217 said no, and 96 said yes. 
The results confirmed what I’d already 
anticipated: My peers valued social-polit-
ical values to a point of unwillingness to 
pursue someone intimately and valued 
having similar political values to a signifi-
cant other. That being said, politics aren’t 
a relationship dealbreaker to those who 
took the poll, meaning there is a happy 
medium of space where we can coexist 
and even have the chance to enjoy those 
with differing political beliefs.
