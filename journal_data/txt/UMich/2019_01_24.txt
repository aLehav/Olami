Just in time for its 11th 
anniversary, Michigan-based 
craft beer bar HopCat rolled 
out a new name for its award-
winning Crack Fries on Jan. 
14. The newly deemed “Cos-
mik Fries” were the center of 
anniversary celebrations Sat-
urday, during which free fries 
and a fries eating contest were 
offered at each HopCat loca-
tion.
According to Joe Sonheim, 
director of marketing for Bar-
Fly Ventures, the decision to 
change the name was made in 
early December by executives 
at BarFly Ventures, the parent 
company of HopCat. Although 

the name Crack Fries was 
originally meant to be clever, 
executives realized it could be 
insensitive towards the crack 
epidemic and drug addiction, 
Sonheim explained.
“When we started the com-
pany, ‘crack fries’ was certainly 
meant to be a tongue-in-cheek 
reference,” 
Sonheim 
said. 
“But as the company grew and 
expanded into different mar-
kets, such as Detroit, we’ve had 
to figure out who we are in the 
community. We’ve gotten good 
feedback from the community 
… based on that feedback, we 
decided it was the right thing 
to do to change the name.”
Despite the name change, a 
December statement by Hop-
Cat assures customers the 

ingredients and recipe of the 
fries, named one of the ten best 
French fries in America, will 
remain the same.
The new name for the signa-
ture side — Cosmik Fries — is 
inspired by the song “Cosmik 
Debris” by Frank Zappa, one of 
founder Mark Sellers’s favor-
ite musicians. Featuring lyrics 
about a mystery man selling a 
magical substance made “with 
the oil of Aphrodite” and “the 
dust of the Grand Wazoo,” he 
says the song, and thus the 
new name, is more reflective of 
HopCat’s image.
“A big part of HopCat is our 
relationship to music,” Son-
heim said. “(The song “Cos-
mik Debris”) is a little weird, 
a little out there, definitely fun 

and we thought it was a pretty 
good tie-in to who we are. It 
speaks to the culture and vibe 
of our HopCat restaurant.”
The 
name 
change 
has 
received much attention, even 
receiving coverage by nation-
al platforms like Fox News. 
Online reactions to the new 
name have been mixed.
Some customers expressed 
the move conforms to a trend 
of political correctness. In one 
tweet which has been liked by 
500 people and retweeted 48 
times at the time of publica-
tion, Liv Brosofske, a student 
at Western Michigan Univer-
sity, claimed the name change 
is another example of oversen-
sitivity.

On Wednesday, the University 
of Michigan’s Barger Leadership 
Institute invited Zilka Joseph, 
internationally acclaimed poet, 
author and teacher, to lead a 
poetry 
workshop 
in 
Weiser 
Hall for advanced fellows in a 
BLI cohort called the Mindful 
Leader 
Program. 
Joseph’s 
seminar focused on channeling 
creativity to engage with our 
lives and work.
The Mindful Leader program 
is a contemplative practices 
program 
composed 
of 
a 
10-person cohort. The cohort 
engages in mindfulness-related 
discussions, 
workshops 
and 
other immersive and experiential 
learning 
opportunities. 
It 
provides 
participants 
with 
diverse approaches to cultivating 
mindfulness, along with the 
language and skills to practice 
habits of mindful leadership.
BLI 
Director 
Ramaswami 
Mahalingam introduced Joseph 
to the cohort and praised not 
only her poetry, but also her 
ability to immediately connect 
to students and explain nuanced 
poetic concepts efficiently.

Whitmer’s 
directives
target bias 
on the job

New orders to protect 
members of LGBTQ 
community, women

Since her inauguration on 
Jan. 1, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 
has taken action to reform and 
increase access to institutions of 
government for minorities and 
women, particularly through the 
use of executive directives.
In the last several weeks, two 
directives in particular have 
generated 
conversation 
over 
their potential impact on the 
economy and people of Michi-
gan.
The first directive, signed Jan. 
7, prohibits any discrimination 
or withholding of opportunities 
from government employees on 
the basis of sexual orientation 
or gender identity. The second, 
signed Jan. 8, intends to limit 
wage inequality by prohibiting 
state agencies and employers 
from asking about applicants’ 
previous salaries until a job and 
salary offer has been made.
These orders are among ten 
signed by Gov. Whitmer in her 
first several weeks in office, 
aimed 
towards 
demonstrat-
ing her administration’s intent 
to resolve social disparities in 
income and employment.

Though 
marijuana 
is 
now legal in Michigan, the 
Department of Licensing and 
Regulatory Affairs does not yet 
provide commercial licenses 
for 
recreational 
marijuana 
dispensaries. 
Following 
the 
Dec. 6 legalization, local and 
out-of-state 
businesses 
have 
identified a gray area in the law, 
allowing them to gift marijuana 
with the sale of other products 
such as sweets, snacks and even 
art.
Smoke’s

Arbor-based

between 
legalization 
of 

marijuana and the opening of 
recreational 
dispensaries 
in 
Michigan, according to Jack 
Groom, Business senior and 
head of development at Smoke’s 
Chocolate.
“On the day after legalization 
(Bernard) put his website up, 
just taking advantage of the way 
the law is written and how it 
exists, relying on precedent out 
of several different states where 
people have employed a similar 
business model,” Groom said.
According to the Michigan 
Taxation and Regulation of 
Marihuana 
Act, 
gifting 
of 
marijuana is permissible in a 
restricted amount and manner.

The Michigan Daily sat down with 
Cynthia Wilbanks, vice president of 
the Office of Government Relations, 
to discuss the University of Michi-

gan’s efforts to work with officehold-
ers and agencies at the local, state and 
federal level. Wilbanks and her office 
manage interactions with govern-
ment officials in regard to legislative 
and regulatory policy that affects the 
University and its programs.
Organization including corpora-
tions, political action committees and 
nonprofits hire lobbyists to influence 

government officials and agencies by 
advocating for or against certain poli-
cies. Wilbanks said the University’s 
strategy for working with lawmakers 
and government agencies takes a per-
sonal approach.
“In this office, it’s relationships 
that are really the foundation of 
our work,” Wilbanks said. “We use 
opportunities that are both formal 

and informal to establish those rela-
tionships and they come in lots of dif-
ferent settings, so it’s not always going 
up to the state capital, it’s not always 
visiting with offices in Washington. 
It’s a variety of ways that we work 
on those relationships and the same 
is true for the community relations 
work.

A new pharmacy on E. Sta-
dium Blvd. celebrated its grand 
opening on Tuesday. Ann Arbor 
Pharmacy is an apothecary of-
fering customers service using 
a European and Middle Eastern 
approach. 
Manager Ziad Ghamraoui said 
he wanted to change the way his 
neighbors and other members 
of the Ann Arbor community 

received health and beauty sup-
plies. After owning two pharma-
cies in the area, he decided to 
take a different approach to his 
new business endeavor. 
“I wanted … my community to 
have access to high-end, organic 
products,” Ghamraoui said. “I 
didn’t want to carry the main-
stream stuff, so (I) decided to opt 
to carry high-quality products 
that you can’t find at a normal 
pharmacy.” 
These products include soaps, 
herbal and homeopathic medi-

cation, as well as high potency 
multivitamins. Ghamraoui said 
he was deliberate in the products 
that he chose to carry. 
“Everything in the store is very 
well-curated,” Ghamraoui said. 
“We went through a very selec-
tive process and chose pretty 
much some of the best names out 
there that we believe the commu-
nity can use and is to their best 
interest.”
Nursing sophomore Caroline 
Baubonis said the pharmacy pre-
sented a creative take on self care.
“Opening organic pharma-
cies in Ann Arbor expands the 
realm of medicine beyond the 
laboratory,” Baubonis said. 
Ghamraoui said he aims to 
change the speed and efficien-
cy in which customers receive 
their prescriptions. 
“Usually it takes 15, 20, 30 
minutes to get your prescrip-
tions,” Ghamraoui said. “If 
you’ve been to the Middle East 
or Europe, you’re in and out in 
minutes. It shouldn’t take hours 
to fill a prescription, so we are a 
pharmacy that has a profession-
al staff that allows people to be 
in and out in seconds. We pride 
ourselves on this.” 
Ghamraoui said while his 
staff is not comprised of physi-
cians, they are knowledgeable 
in customer service and indi-
vidualized patient care. 
“Our staff went to school for 
health care and did services on 
dermatology,” Ghamraoui said. 
“We have a background. We 
may not be certified as physi-
cians but we know about skin 
care and the pharmacists are 

the most accessible health care 
professionals.”
The design of the pharmacy 
mimics a European boutique and 
was created by Lisa Suave, a de-
signer at Synecdoche Designs. 
Ghamraoui praised Suave’s work.
“I told her this is what I want 
— this is what international phar-
macies look like,” Ghamraoui said. 
“She did a good job on my vision.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Maxine 
Taskin stopped into the phar-
macy to take a look. She said she 
thought the store was a good 
complement to the local business 
community.
“I think that this is a great ad-
dition to both the Ann Arbor and 
University of Michigan com-
munity,” Taskin said. “Many stu-
dents have specific health or skin 
problems that they either have 
to order a variety of expensive 
products online to treat, or have 
to deal with alone and away from 
home. Having a resource to help 
not only provide high-end prod-
ucts but help diagnose specific is-
sues is amazing.” 
Ghamraoui said a lot of friends 
and local business owners attend-
ed a grand opening party, medi-
ated by the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti 
Regional Chamber of Commerce. 
 
“We were offering discounts 
and lots of people bought lots of 
products at the grand opening 
sale price,” Ghamraoui said. “It 
was very humbling … My mom 
and dad happened to be in town 
and beat the storm (that night), 
so I was happy they were there. 
We brought some sweets from 
Lebanon and Syria and catered 
Lebanese food.”

Boutique pharmacy provides high-end care

Recently opened shop takes an apothecary-style approach to organic medicine, patient service

OLIVIA TAUBER
Daily Staff Reporter 


For many Michigan residents, 
Gov. Whitmer’s executive actions 
are seen as the fulfillment of contin-
ued campaign promises to pursue 
anti-discrimination measures.
In her inaugural address, Gov. 
Whitmer assured her voters that she 
would cross party lines to address 
their concerns.
“I will be a governor for every-
one, and I am committed to working 
across party lines to ensure that all 
Michiganders have opportunity,” 
she said.
This sentiment was echoed in 
the text of both directives, as the 
first directly states, “all Michigan 
residents deserve fair treatment and 
respect from their government — in 
employment, state contracting, and 
when accessing services from state 
government.”
According to Katie Kelly, Public 
Policy junior and communications 
director for the University of Michi-
gan’s chapter of College Democrats, 
both of these directives will ben-
efit Michigan residents, particularly 
those soon to enter the workforce.
“I only see this as impacting 
future workers in a positive man-
ner,” Kelly said. “Especially for 
women, we have grown up in a 
world where we are not always con-
sidered equal. Having a governor 
sign something like this into law 
shows that the state of Michigan 
values women’s hard work.”
Directive 2019-09, which bolsters 
opportunities for members of the 
LGBTQ community, expands on 
previous legislation signed by outgo-
ing Gov. Rick Snyder. However, Gov. 
Snyder’s policy made exemptions for 
churches and similar religious orga-
nizations, allowing these groups to 
choose who they extend service and 
employment to on the basis of reli-
gious belief. 

While Gov. Whitmer’s directive 
only applies to public employers, 
Kelly sees the omission of a religious 
exemption as eliminating the possi-
bility of discrimination.
“By allowing for exemptions, 
(Snyder) created loopholes that 
organizations could jump through 
to discriminate against certain 
people,” Kelly said. “Governor 
Whitmer’s covers all aspects of pos-
sible discrimination against LGBTQ 
people.”
Will Sherry, director of the Uni-
versity’s Spectrum Center, was also 
optimistic about the effects of Whit-
mer’s new legislation, particularly 
for LGBTQ students at the Univer-
sity.
“A lot of the work we do is advis-
ing and working with students to 
figure out what they want for their 
own lives, and how they want to 
contribute to the world,” Sherry said 
of the Spectrum Center. “When we 
talk about building a diverse work-
force, I think these are the kind of 
initiatives that can really help retain 
talent in Michigan and bring new 
talent to the state.”
Gov. Whitmer’s two directives 
have also garnered a considerable 
amount of bipartisan support, sug-
gesting an increased support for 
government reform.
Dylan Berger, LSA sophomore 
and president of the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans, 
explained in an email interview both 
directives were a step in the right 
direction for the people of Michigan.
“We applaud Governor Whitmer 
for working to ensure that all Michi-
ganders, regardless of gender and 
sexual orientation, have a chance 
to succeed,” Berger said . “By build-
ing on the progress made by Gov-
ernor Snyder, Governor Whitmer 
has proved that fighting against 
discrimination is truly a bipartisan 
issue.”
Berger went on to state that this 
collaborative policy-making effort 

should be used by Gov. Whitmer 
in resolving other issues facing the 
state.
“Governor Whitmer ought to 
build on this bipartisan momentum 
with other key issues for Michigan 
such as fixing our infrastructure,” 
he wrote.
Nonetheless, arguments have 
arisen pointing out flaws in Gov. 
Whitmer’s plan. In an interview 
with Michigan Radio, Holly Wetzel, 
communications coordinator at the 
Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 
said Gov. Whitmer’s policy would 
change little in the way of wage dis-
crimination.
“Unfortunately, 
(Whitmer’s) 
well-intentioned solution is a flawed 
approach to solving the wrong prob-
lem,” she said. “It has long been ille-
gal for employers to discriminate 
financially or otherwise based on 
one’s gender.”
While these two directives dem-
onstrate top priorities of the Whit-
mer administration, they represent 
only a fraction of the goals the new 
governor has aimed to achieve at the 
start of her term in office.
The other eight directives put 
forth within Gov. Whitmer’s first 
several weeks in office are aimed at 
increasing government transparen-
cy and minimizing ethics violations.
In her inaugural address, Gov. 
Whitmer expressed an optimism 
for government reform, and a desire 
to build off her early directives with 
future legislation and grassroots 
involvement in policy-making.
“I am so looking forward to 
working with you over the next 
weeks and months and years,” Gov. 
Whitmer said. “We may belong to 
different parties, but we are all here 
today for the same reason — we are 
proud Michiganders first and fore-
most, and we owe it to the people 
we serve to cast partisanship aside, 
to roll up our sleeves and to build 
bridges together.”

PENNY STAMPS DISTINGUISHED SPEAKER SERIES

RUCHITA IYER/Daily
Roman J. Witt Resident JuYeon Kim speaks on her artistic journey as part of the Penny Stamps 
Distinguished Speaker Series at the UMMA Wednesdy night.

Ann Arbor’s fourth annual deer 
cull ended a week ahead of schedule, 
the 
city 
announced 
Monday, 
resulting in the reopening of a dozen 
parks and nature areas. From Jan. 2 
to Jan. 20, sharpshooters removed 
112 deer, failing to meet the city’s 
goal of bagging up to 150. 
In a statement, Lisa Wondrash, 
communications director of Ann 
Arbor, said White Buffalo, the 
contractor hired to carry out the 
effort, decided to finish the cull 
early.
“The earlier than anticipated 
completion date is a result of optimal 
weather conditions since Jan. 2 that 
enabled White Buffalo to operate on 
consecutive days without significant 
breaks in between and within 
budget,” Wondrash said. “Per the 
contract, White Buffalo is paid for 
time and materials, not per deer.”
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 
approved the deer management 
program — which takes both 
lethal and nonlethal approaches 
to reducing the size of the local 
herd — four years ago in response 
to complaints from residents about 
damage to landscaping and deer-
vehicle collisions. Ecologists have 
also pointed out the problems an 
overabundance of the animals 
causes 
to 
the 
environment, 
especially to tree saplings.
A total of 386 deer have been 
killed and 78 surgically sterilized as 
a result of the program, which has 
been the subject of long-running 
debate in the community and cost 
the city upwards of half a million 
dollars.
Bernie 
Banet, 
member 
of 
Washtenaw Citizens for Ecological 

Balance, said if the city was able 
to reduce the deer population to a 
sustainable level, then only smaller 
culls would be necessary in the 
future to maintain a healthy herd 
size.
“If we have, indeed, reached 
a level where the population is 
acceptable 
according 
to 
those 
measures, then, by virtue of deer 
biology, further culling will still be 
needed, probably each year, to keep 
the population stable,” Banet said. 
“These maintenance culls will be 
smaller than the more aggressive 
culls that have been needed to 
actually reduce a population.” 
A 2016 report from the city found 
54 percent of residents supported 
the cull while 45 percent were 
against it.
Banet 
said 
residents 
have 
generally become more accepting 
of the deer cull now that it has been 
around for a while but noted that 
“passionate opposition from some 
groups has not gone away.” One 
of those organizations is Friends 
of Ann Arbor Wildlife in Nature, 
which has called the program 
unethical and ineffective. Since 
this year’s cull started, protestors 
have 
demonstrated 
near 
the 
sharpshooters’ perches around the 
city, including some on University 
property.
Disruptions 
from 
anti-cull 
protestors were blamed in part 
when White Buffalo failed to meet 
the city’s goal in 2018, killing less 
than half of the 250 deer quota. 
Earlier this month, City Council 
voted down a resolution to take legal 
action against the demonstrators 
who interfered with White Buffalo’s 
sharpshooters. 
The 
measure, 
introduced by Jane Lumm, I-Ward 
2, was based on a state statute 

that makes it illegal for people to 
interfere with the “lawful taking of 
animals” such as Ann Arbor’s deer 
cull.
On Jan. 9, an officer from 
the Division of Public Safety 
and Security warned protestors 
on 
Hubbard 
Road 
about 
the 
consequence of disrupting the 
work of a sharpshooter stationed on 
University property, a misdemeanor 
offense that carries a maximum 
penalty of 93 days in jail and a fine of 
up to $1000.
Melissa Overton, deputy chief 
of police at University of Michigan, 
said the officer did not issue a 
citation — just a verbal warning. 
She said a DPSS officer was placed 
at each of the locations throughout 
the University where the cull was 
conducted.
“We have officers assigned to 
those areas during the deer cull 
for safety reasons and the specific 
complaint that we got came from 
the cull operator,” Overton said. 
“That was the first time that we had 
received that complaint that they 
were actually interfering with that, 
so that’s when we took action.”
Overton said the warning does 
not mean anti-cull protestors can 
no longer demonstrate and that they 
continued to do so on University 
property.
“They can, and they have,” 
Overton said. “One night there were 
six of them in the Arb, and they 
did not interfere, so they weren’t 
screaming into the woods, they 
weren’t obstructing or interfering in 
the actual cull. They were standing 
there, they were chanting, they were 
all in one area. We had no problem.”

City concludes annual deer cull early

Sharpshooters kill 112 deer in parks and nature areas across Ann Arbor

LEAH GRAHAM 
Daily News Editor 

Major universities like Harvard 
and the University of Chicago have 
offices in Washington, D.C. to over-
see their federal lobbying. The Uni-
versity has had one since 1990, one 
of only a few institutions to do so at 
the time, which Wilbanks said put 
the University ahead of the curve. 
“We manage the interactions 
with the members of Congress,” 
Wilbanks said. “We partner lots of 
campus faculty and staff who have 
their own interests in federal pol-
icy, try to help them advance their 
interests.”
Lobbying in Higher Education
Higher education has come to 
inhabit a prominent place in the 
capital’s lobbying scene. Accord-
ing to the Center for Responsive 
Politics, as of Oct. 24, the latest 
reporting deadline, the educa-
tion industry spent more than 
$58 million on federal lobbying in 
2018, employing a total of 991 indi-
vidual lobbyists. The top spender 
was the Association of American 
Medical Colleges at $3,370,000, 
followed by $920,000 from the 
Apollo Education Group, which 
owns the for-profit online degree 
program University of Phoenix. 
The University of California sys-
tem ranked third, with $900,000 
in expenditures. The University 
spent $385,000 on federal lobbying 
in 2017 and, according to Wilbanks, 
$290,000 in total in 2018.
Following the inauguration of 
a new class of elected officials ear-
lier this month, Wilbanks said her 
office has remained consistent in 
its approach to working with politi-
cians and government agencies.
“You don’t walk in with an agen-
da right away, that’s not our favorite 
thing to do,” Wilbanks said. “Our 
first thing is getting acquainted: 
We’re here, we’re going to be really 
interested in getting acquainted, 

you know, you have legislative pri-
orities, we have legislative priori-
ties, they are not going to be terribly 
different than what we hear from 
other universities, but we’re here 
in the capital so you’re going to see 
more of us, and what you’re trying 
to do is just build rapport.”
Policy Interests
Research funding is one of the 
University’s main policy goals. In 
fiscal year 2018, research expendi-
tures totaled a record $1.55 billion, 
more than half of which came from 
$852 million in federal funds. Given 
the school’s status as the top public 
research university, Wilbanks said 
securing funding for those pro-
grams was a priority.
“That whole research agenda 
is really important for the Univer-
sity,” Wilbanks said. “I could pick 
out individual policies, but it’s real-
ly policies that support expanding 
opportunities for our researchers, 
our faculty to be successful in pur-
suing really interesting ideas that 
benefit the public good, so that’s 
sort of number one.”
Like other schools, the Univer-
sity focuses on issues that impact 
institutional 
operations 
beyond 
research money, such as education 
policy or health care financing. 
Wilbanks said state and federal 
tax policy was another one of her 
office’s interests.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 
which was signed into law in 
December 2017, introduced a tax on 
the endowments of private colleges, 
affecting schools like Harvard and 
Cornell. Wilbanks said the change 
did not apply to the University’s 
nearly $11 billion endowment, given 
its status as a public institution.
“Many of the private universi-
ties were affected by it,” Wilbanks 
said. “There’s one thing that most 
private universities are focused on 
right now: repealing that certain 
section of the tax policy.”
Dealing with New Controlling 
Parties

In the midterm elections, Demo-
crats won the House of Representa-
tives while Republicans defended 
their majority in the Senate, leaving 
the chambers of Congress divided 
between the two parties.
Wilbanks said her office was 
comfortable advocating for policy 
objectives with members of the 
majority and the minority party as 
needed, but noted the partisan split 
between the Republican-controlled 
state legislature and Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer, a Democrat who was 
elected in the “blue wave” that 
swept the state’s top elected offices.
Whitmer was a state representa-
tive from 2000 to 2006 and served 
in the Michigan Senate from 2006 
to 2015, where she was the Senate 
minority leader for four years. Wil-
banks said she already had a work-
ing relationship with Whitmer. 
“This is the first time in a while 
that we will have a governor of one 
party and legislature in Michigan 
of the other party, so we’re going 
to learn how to navigate and what 
the interests are in the legislature 
in the majority and the governor 
who is of the opposite party, but we 
know the governor,” Wilbanks said. 
“I worked with her when she was in 
the state legislature.”
Although Wilbanks said the 
University’s policy agenda was not 
particularly dependent on officials’ 
party affiliation, she added the new 
partisan makeup could alter the 
landscape for certain pieces of leg-
islation.
“There may be issues in the U.S. 
Congress, for instance, that the U.S. 
House is going to be really support-
ive on, but you have to get it through 
the Senate and the Senate still is the 
opposite party,” Wilbanks said. 
“There’s going to be some chal-
lenges. If life doesn’t bring you 
challenges, then you’re going to be 
bored and I don’t want to be bored. 
We look forward to it. It’s exciting 
in many ways.”

HOPCAT
From Page 1A

“Hopcat is changing the 
name of their crack fries 
because of the crack epidem-
ic in America,” Brosofske 
wrote. “y’all are getting way 
too soft [sic].”
However, others on social 
media 
applauded 
HopCat 
and expressed their belief 
the 
original 
name 
was 
insensitive. David Sampson, 
CEO of Mariners Inn, a sub-
stance abuse treatment and 
recovery center in southeast 
Michigan, published an edi-
torial representing Mariners 
Inn in the Detroit Free Press 
supporting the change.
“Comparing 
a 
delicious 
food item with an illicit sub-
stance that is responsible 
for devastating our commu-
nities is objectively hurt-
ful,” Sampson wrote in the 
editorial. “While I was not 
surprised to see negative 
social media commentary in 
response to HopCat’s deci-
sion, I was certainly dis-
appointed that a company 
would receive such back-
lash over a move that was 
intended to create inclusion. 
The perspective that people 
are being too sensitive, too 
politically correct or that 
they are “just fries” is a sur-
face-level look at a disease 
that has destroyed the lives 
of millions.”
While 
eating 
lunch 
at 
HopCat 
Ann 
Arbor 
with 
family, LSA freshman Jake 
Moody, kicker on the Uni-
versity of Michigan foot-
ball team, said he comes to 
HopCat particularly for the 
fries. While he thinks the 
name change is unnecessary, 
he does not mind as long as 

the fries themselves do not 
change.
“I don’t really think the 
(name change) was needed, 
but as long as everybody’s 
happy and the fries stay 
the same, I’m okay with it,” 
Moody said.
Regardless of the name 
change, Cosmik Fries remain 
as popular as ever. Accord-
ing to Emmeline Jurek, gen-
eral manager of HopCat Ann 
Arbor, 202 orders of Cosmik 
Fries were served to over 
900 customers on Saturday 
at the Ann Arbor location 
in celebration of HopCat’s 
11th anniversary, equaling 
to about 50 pounds of free 
fries. This does not include 
the fries set aside for the 
annual fries eating contest, 
which Jurek estimates con-
tribute roughly another 20 
pounds.
A tradition since HopCat’s 
first anniversary, the fries 
eating contest collected $5 
from each competitor, which 
was then matched by Hop-
Cat for donation to a charity 
chosen by each HopCat loca-
tion. According to Jurek, 12 
people competed in the Ann 
Arbor contest, resulting in 
$120 raised for the Humane 
Society of Huron Valley.
Plymouth resident Mat-
thew Holowicki won the 
contest, eating 3.4 pounds of 
Cosmik Fries in six minutes. 
He received a HopCat prize 
package valued at $500 and 
will advance to compete for 
the championship against 
winners from other HopCat 
locations at the 22nd Annual 
Michigan Summer Beer Fes-
tival in Ypsilanti in July. He 
has won the last four HopCat 
Ann Arbor fries eating con-
tests and has been the over-
all champion twice.

“(Cosmik Fries) are excel-
lent, and there’s a reason 
they’re so popular,” Holo-
wicki said. “Eating contests 
are better when you’re eat-
ing good food. When they’re 
tasty, it’s a lot easier to get 
it down … Though if they 
want to call them Cosmik 
Fries, that’s fine, but they’re 
always going to be Crack 
Fries to me.”
Jurek said there have been 
comments from customers 
about the transition from 
Crack Fries to Cosmik Fries. 
She said the change is in line 
with HopCat ideals.
“When a HopCat opens 
in a community, part of our 
mission is to enrich that 
community,” 
Jurek 
said. 
“We’re a ‘people first’ com-
pany. That shows in the way 
that we serve, in the way 
that we buy beer, the brew-
eries that we promote, the 
ideals that we promote. The 
fact that we made the (name) 
change based on our ‘people 
first’ mentality is what we’re 
sticking to, which to us just 
embodies more of who we 
are.”
Each HopCat restaurant is 
unique depending on the city 
that it is in, Jurek explained. 
HopCat 
Ann 
Arbor, 
for 
example, focuses on hiring 
local and supporting local 
charities. This investment 
in the community, according 
to Jurek, is part of what con-
tributes to HopCat’s long-
standing success.
“I think we vibe really 
well with the funky, diverse, 
open-minded part of Ann 
Arbor,” Jurek said. “We’re 
a chain because people like 
us, not because we’re this 
conglomerate that’s going to 
take over the city.”

“It is rare to have someone 
who is a good poet but also a 
good teacher who is committed 
to 
teaching, 
because 
artists 
aren’t always the best teachers,” 
Mahalingam said. 
Joseph began the workshop 
by instructing the cohorts to 
maintain an open mind and 
proceeded to guide them through 
a number of exercises revolving 
around a topic as simple as food. 
Through 
the 
exercises, 
the 
cohorts reflected, reminisced and 
were able to share their diverse 
array of experiences and specific 
memories attached to them.

LSA 
senior 
Jessica 
Selzer 
said this workshop dispelled 
misconceptions she had about 
poetry and motivated her to write 
more poetry in her spare time.
“I was never a fan of creative 
writing,” Selzer said. “It’s more 
abstract, and there was always 
an assumption that poetry has to 
rhyme and be in a certain format. 
But the (techniques we learned in 
this workshop) are so simple, and 
make me want to continue writing 
what is on my mind since it broke 
the myth that poetry is supposed 
to be a certain way.”
Joseph’s poetry is unique, 
drawing on her experiences as 
an immigrant from India and 
a member of the small Indian-
Jewish minority and diasporic 

community. These themes, as 
well as those tackling identity, are 
central to her workshops. Joseph 
has cited these experiences as 
motivating her to become more 
inclusive and sensitive to diverse 
backgrounds in her work.
As the workshop continued, 
the 
BLI 
cohorts 
journeyed 
through 
vivid 
and 
poignant 
personal stories. According to 
LSA sophomore Olivia Chan, the 
workshop provided her with the 
specific techniques to advance her 
creative writing.
“Although I have been dabbling 
in poetry, Zilka has encouraged 
me (to pursue it further) and I will 
use the techniques to declutter my 
mind and when I journal,” Chan 
said.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
4A — Thursday, January 24, 2019

O

ver the recent holiday, 
I attended an event 
as part of the 2019 

Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day Symposium at the 
University of Michigan. I heard 
about the harsh experiences 
three women faced as they 
participated in a student-led 
committee to confront racism 
in the South during the 1960s. 
Someone asked how the civil 
rights movement became as 
powerful as it was, and one 
woman reasoned that the might 
of 
those 
oppressed 
during 

that time period was aligned 
with the spirit of the youth. 
In other words, these women 
claimed part of the reason why 
the movement began to peak 
in the ‘60s was because of how 
relentless and driven they, as 
young individuals at the time, 
had to be not only to gain their 
freedoms and their rights but 
more importantly to survive 
in a setting that favored white 
terrorism.

Today, 
there 
have 
been 

strides that mirror those of 
past movements in terms of 
collaboration among youth and 
the drastic nature of change 
necessary to find solutions 
to improve the quality of the 
environment. 
Since 
Speaker 

Nancy Pelosi announced the 
House 
of 
Representatives 

committee on climate change 
would 
be 
revived, 
newly-

elected U.S. Rep. Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., 
has 

made 
known 
her 
adamant 

support for the Green New Deal 
as a plan this committee can 
pursue to create an economy.

Driven by the stories and the 

mentality of people in America’s 
working class, Ocasio-Cortez 
has demonstrated herself as 
the standard bearer of this 
mentality for radical social and 
economic change. Referencing 
the New Deal pursued during 
the Great Depression and other 
major revolutionary plans that 
have been implemented during 
our history, she rationalizes the 
magnitude of this change to the 
economy towards improving 

the environment is necessary: 
“The only way we are going to 
get out of this situation is by 
choosing to be courageous. 
(The Green New Deal) is 
going to be the Great Society, 
the moonshot, the civil rights 
movement of our generation. 
That is the scale of the 
ambition that this movement 
is going to require.”

Ocasio-Cortez and other 

politicians 
have 
presented 

themselves 
as 
a 
beacon 

of 
inspiration 
for 
youth, 

while also contributing to 
the growth of the Sunrise 
Movement. 
Following 
the 

2018 
midterm 
elections, 

Sunrise 
activists 
made 

themselves 
visible 
to 
the 

public by occupying Speaker 
Pelosi’s office and demanding 
newly-elected congressional 
representatives 
begin 
to 

discuss and work on the 
logistics 
of 
the 
Green 

New Deal. In essence, the 
spirit of this organization 
encompasses the idea that 
everyday people are the ones 
affected 
by 
the 
decisions 

of 
their 
authorities 
and 

lawmakers 
and, 
therefore, 

are the ones who can validate 
their demands for appropriate 
actions from the government. 
As these activists assume the 
position of demanding better 
from the government in terms 
of environmental health, fair 
economic activity and just 
social standards, they are 
undoubtedly inspiring more 
youth to join them and more 
adults to gear their decision-
making 
towards 
pleasing 

the majority that has become 
composed of youths.

In other words, the Sunrise 

Movement is working to collect 
supporters and make climate 
change a deciding factor in the 
2020 Democratic presidential 
primaries, 
in 
addition 
to 

strides they have already made 
for 
awareness 
towards 
the 

necessity for the improvement 
of our environment. 

Past and present movements 

show that the spirit of the 

times during any era is carried 
and propelled by its young 
people. 
Today, 
the 
Sunrise 

Movement and their supporters 
are 
educated, 
level-headed 

and capable of addressing the 
concerns that we have about the 
world we are living in. We are 
the ones who are realizing that 
something has to be done to 
make a better future possible. 
We are the ones who are willing 
to work to make it happen. Just 
as 
Ocasio-Cortez 
mentioned 

in her contribution to Bernie 
Sanders’s national town hall 
on climate change, it is natural 
to fear change and to believe 
change on such a massive scale 
is impossible. However, today 
will be another example of 
the benefits that result from 
showing 
persistence 
and 

resilience in the fight for the 
life we want and the fight for 
demanding our authorities do 
what is right. 

As a youth today, my 

commitment 
to 
advocating 

for the improvement of our 
environment is exemplary of 
the spirit of the times. While 
I 
am 
constantly 
thinking 

about the purpose I will serve 
in this world as an engineer 
after 
graduation, 
I 
also 

think about the thousands of 
students here who will have 
an equally significant purpose 
to serve after graduation. 
Whether their majors direct 
them towards the medical 
field, public health, criminal 
justice, the natural sciences, 
mathematics, 
history, 

political science or even the 
realm of art, every student 
will have the advantage of 
belonging to a community 
that values progress in all 
sectors of our society. Because 
I know we and people like us 
across the nation and around 
the world will ensure history 
favors the bold, I have hope for 
the future of our society.

Why I have hope for the future of our environment

The ethics of scamming in the millenial age

T

he 
art 
of 
scamming 

has been fascinating to 

me ever since the term 

“influencer” came to light. A scam 

can take many forms: It can be as 

simple as knowing how to get a 

free drink at a bar or as complex 

as manipulating financiers and 

loan companies into lending you 

money that doesn’t exist and 

buying Macaulay Culkin dinner to 

convince him that you’re German 

royalty. We live in a time when the 

internet provides anonymity at 

extreme consequences. Identities 

are stolen, music festivals are lied 

about and learning the secret to 

making an orchid crown is priced 

at a remarkable $165.

Recently, reporters have begun 

to pick up pieces on scams large 

and small, and it’s drawing a lot 

of attention. With the release of 

the Fyre Festival documentaries 

on Netflix and Hulu, a TV show 

dedicated to Anna Delvey (the 

German woman who convinced 

New York’s elite crowds she was a 

European heiress) in the works, and 

a recent Twitter thread exposing 

the scams of Instagram influencer 

Caroline 
Calloway 
(whose 

Instagram bio reads, horrifyingly, 

“No not that writer, the one you 

love!!!”) it’s safe to say that scams 

are very in. Each of these scammers 

has been white, middle class and 

undeniably privileged. But does 

who their scams target matter?

I started following Caroline 

Calloway on Instagram about three 

years ago. My interest in her at 

the time was mostly fascination. 

I didn’t exactly like her, but I was 

curious about her. Her posts were 

less about her pictures and more 

focused on sharing long, detailed 

retellings of parties in castles and 

traveling abroad. Her Instagram 

stories 
depicted 
her 
beautiful 

life with her beautiful friends, 

accompanied by lengthy, and at 

times, TMI descriptions of her 

current life. This was not an account 

for purely visual inspiration, and the 

target demographic was not your 

average American teen. Calloway 

was an icon for the girls who read 

fairy tales later into adolescence 

than they’re probably willing to 

admit and who still hold onto the 

romantic notions found in “Notting 

Hill” or “The Princess Diaries” — 

an impressionable group of middle-

class white girls who wanted a life 

more exciting than their own. So 

when Calloway decided to produce 

“creativity workshops” in a national 

tour, it’s no wonder that her first 

event sold out in several hours — 

with tickets priced at $165.

Calloway differs from Delvey 

and Billy McFarland of Fyre 

Festival in a few distinct ways. 

Where Delvey and McFarland 

sought large-scale multimillion-

dollar scams, Calloway’s scams 

have been small and not blatantly 

manipulative. But where Delvey 

and 
McFarland 
exploited 
the 

wealthy, Calloway’s scams target 

her audience — mainly obsessed 

tweens, 
teens, 
and 
twenty-

somethings — and they’ve been 

going on for quite some time.

Part of Calloway’s pull has 

been her extreme commitment to 

honesty through detail. Following 

Calloway on Instagram is like 

following her in the literal sense. 

It’s as if you’re standing two steps 

behind her as she goes throughout 

her day. She shares everything: her 

wake up, breakfast, trips to the gym, 

flower shopping, (oddly frequent) 

thank 
you 
note 
writing 
and 

especially her salad dinner parties 

that she seems to have almost 

nightly with various successful and 

vaguely famous friends. She doesn’t 

have a job and she doesn’t seem 

to need one. She lives in a studio 

apartment somewhere in the West 

Village. So if Calloway is spending 

her days stretching, eating salad 

and wandering around New York, 

how is she making money?

Recently 
Calloway 
has 

denied her wealth (claiming salad 

ingredients are cheap and that she 

eats a lot of toast), but anyone who 

follows her knows she’s wealthy. 

Though Calloway claims total 

openness and honesty in her social 

media interactions, her followers 

aren’t tricked into thinking her life 

is perfect. They know she shows 

them what she chooses to: parties, 

boys, friends and orchids.

When Calloway chooses to 

show the more negative aspects of 

her life, these insights are carefully 

cultivated with a victim-based 

narrative. First, it was her fall-out 

with the publishing company and 

her lost book deal (which she used 

to later sell individual chapters 

of the book she never published 

for $5 a digital pop, totalling to 

a staggering $50 for a DIGITAL 

book). Then it was digging up 

nostalgia and sadness for her days 

at the University of Cambridge and 

her ex-boyfriend. Most recently 

the sob story has consisted of 

mysterious and vague photos of her 

father’s messy home in Virginia, 

his mental health problems and 

her recovery from these childhood 

traumas — from which she has 

gained inspiration to pursue her 

most recent endeavor of creativity 

workshops.

These creativity workshops 

have been Calloway’s breaking 

point. Having promised orchid 

crowns, professional photos and 

the “super salads” she shares with 

her friends, Calloway delivered 

very little. But Calloway did more 

than promise salads to her fans — 

she charged them $165 per ticket 

and planned a full American tour, 

one for which she never booked 

venues. Yes, Calloway got in over 

her head and planned very, very 

poorly. Yes, Calloway’s fans have 

mainly given positive reviews to 

the workshops Calloway has given 

so far. But is it right for Calloway to 

take money from her fans to list off 

cliches and life stories that they’ve 

already heard?

Meet and greets are sometimes 

ticketed events, and Calloway’s 

fans seem more than willing to pay 

the price to meet their icon. But 

Calloway isn’t exactly an influencer, 

and she isn’t exactly a celebrity. 

She’s a 27-year-old woman who 

probably read fairy tales much later 

into her adolescence than she’s 

willing to admit and who secretly 

views the fantasies of “Notting 

Hill” and “The Princess Diaries” 

as aspirational. Calloway’s fans 

love her because they know she’s 

essentially just like them (albeit 

a 
prettier, 
wealthier 
version). 

By charging these like-minded 

women nearly $200 to “be like 

her,” Calloway is manipulating her 

power to exploit a group of people 

who already hear her words as 

gospel.

Calloway is, of course, just 

one of many twenty-something 

influencers trying to make a living 

off of an abstract brand she’s built 

for herself, and she’s certainly 

received her taste of internet 

backlash over the past few weeks 

for her exploitative endeavors. 

Yes, Calloway is a product of the 

broken influencer system. Yes, 

Calloway is likely not trying to 

exploit her fans on any conscious 

level. But had Calloway taken this 

criticism to heart and apologized 

earnestly, I wouldn’t be writing 

this piece. Calloway’s apologies 

were half-hearted, self-serving and 

angry. I’ve continued to monitor 

Calloway’s stories and each day 

they become more despicable. 

Privilege lets people get away with 

a lot and Calloway is no exception. 

Her scams have hurt her fans and 

will continue to do so. Her denial of 

any and all wrongdoings are what 

makes her actions all the more 

horrifying. She’s gotten away with 

it so far — why not keep going?

It’s never too early!

Hold on to the horizon

I 

used to think I was 
the only one. The only 
kid to spend their car 

rides tearing through books, 
replacing themselves with the 
protagonist, stretching and 
pinching the character until 
I recognized myself in the 
reflection. I was always sorely 
disappointed when the movie 
adaptations of my favorite 
novels came out, not only 
because the characters rarely 
looked the way I expected 
but 
because 
they 
didn’t 

carry the same experiences 
and histories I had molded 
for them in my mind. The 
specificity of a movie never 
afforded itself the kind of 
shapelessness I’d grown to 
love in novels.

I kept these behaviors 

hidden 
from 
most 
until 

I came to the realization 
I 
wasn’t 
alone 
during 

conversations with friends 
in my sophomore year of 
college. Someone mentioned 
they spent the larger part of 
their seventh grade staring 
out of the window of their 
bedroom at a grey brick wall 
as if there was a window with 
a “boy next door” to fall in 
love with, prompted by the 
music video for Taylor Swift’s 
ballad 
“You 
Belong 
With 

Me.” 
Assurances 
followed, 

and parallel stories flowed of 
instances where all of us had 
made insertions of ourselves 
in the gaps of stories. Each 
of us had cherry-picked the 
experiences of the characters 
which we identified with and 
skimmed past the ones we 
felt were foreign. They took 
their form in songs, TV or 
movie characters and many 
books — each as imaginative 
and ignorant of details as the 
next.

Lately, 
I’ve 
felt 
the 

impulse to focus my time 
and energy more on forward-
facing pursuits. I’ve switched 
out my fiction reading for 
academic journals and news 
publications. When I have 
free time during my walks 

to class, I gravitate towards 
podcasts instead of albums 
— avoiding the latent guilt 
I feel if I listen to music and 
daydream when I could be 
learning something new. I’m 
driven to pursue this constant 
search for information out 
of a romanticism I’ve tied 
to my incessant curiosity. I 
continue to hope that perhaps 
the next topic I’m exposed to 
will be “the one.” I’ll discover 
the statistic that changes my 
mind on what I want to do 
with my life, or maybe I’ll 
read the article that opens 
up a world I could see myself 
dedicating my future to.

But 
maybe, 
in 
these 

habits, 
I’ve 
lost 
sight 
of 

the 
things 
imagination 

affords to our lives. There’s 
an implicit hierarchy in my 
mind of the importance of 
consuming things that inform 
me about the world around 
me and those that fuel my 
daydreams. 
I 
forgot 
what 

imagination 
and 
mysticism 

taught me about myself, how 
I see myself and who I want 
to see in the mirror in my 
own future. All of that time I 
spent molding the characters 
in stories — highlighting the 
characteristics I appreciated 
— can serve as a sort of “word 
bank” when toying with the 
puzzle of who I want myself to 
be.

College is a time when we’re 

told to hunker down, ground 
ourselves and prepare for our 
futures. We’re given a vision 
of the “real world” that we’re 
on the cusp of experiencing 
—harder and harsher than 
the one we’re accustomed to. 
The pursuit of imagination 
and daydreaming in the view 
of a cold and “real” future 
seems foolish. But something 
beautiful happens when you 
experience something as if it 
was created for and about you. 
You are transformed into a 
distorted version of yourself, 
too far to see but close enough 
to feel.

At the beginning of this 

month, I was sitting on a 
flight back to Ann Arbor 
from my hometown, and, as I 
typically am on all modes of 
transportation, I was hit with 
a wave of introspection. It’s my 
last semester at the University 
of Michigan, and I ran myself 
through all of the things I 
needed to get done over the 
next few months. I made a 
mental to-do list with boxes 
for my job search, mapping 
out my future, saying goodbye 
to friends, making the most of 
a barrage of “lasts.” It felt as 
though I was drafting a will 
for my childhood, planning 
how I was going to change 
and what parts of myself I was 
going to leave or take with 
me. I considered letting go of 
these behaviors that felt like 
testaments to my youth: my 
spontaneity, juvenile curiosity 
and resilient imagination. I felt 
it was time to ground myself in 
reality and find a more logical 
structure for my impending 
future.

At that moment, I looked 

out the window of the plane 
and, in a scene that would 
prompt groans of cliché from 
readers, I saw a fierce and 
fiery 
sunset. 
Instinctively, 

my mind dropped all the 
preoccupied planning and I 
was overwhelmed with the 
sense that this was a sign. I 
realized I would never lose 
my imagination. I’d never stop 
playing the protagonist in my 
life, thinking of my world as 
if it was a story created for 
and about me. Every sunset 
is a sign, every character can 
teach me about myself, every 
song stuck in my head can be 
part of my soundtrack. Your 
imagination may not teach you 
about the realities of the world, 
but it can teach you about the 
role you’d like to play in it. So 
maybe it’s time to “unground” 
ourselves. And in your own 
lives, next time the sky is on 
fire, imagine it’s burning for 
you.

Chiara Lommer, Lanie Van Linge 
highlight improvement for Michigan

Ronni 
Bernstein 
poured 
herself a cup of coffee as she 
pondered some decisions she 
probably didn’t want to make just 
yet.
Stunned, Bernstein was faced 
with one question after stumbling 
out of the gate: How do you move 
forward after a nightmare like 
Saturday?
“We could see some (doubles) 
lineup changes,” Bernstein said 
after Saturday’s matches. “It’s 
something I’ll think about over a 
cup of coffee.”
No team wants to start its 
season on the wrong side of a 
sweep — let alone one at the 
hands of its rival. But Saturday, 
the No. 10 Michigan women’s 
tennis 
team 
did 
just 
that, 
prompting some brainstorming 
from the coach.
The first leg of the Michigan 
Invitational — the team’s annual 
three-day exhibition tournament 
over Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
weekend — did not treat the 
Wolverines well. Unranked Ohio 
State marched into Ann Arbor’s 
Varsity 
Tennis 
Center 
and, 
just two hours later, left with a 
triumphant sweep in the four-
match exhibition doubles series.
Repeated cheers of “Go Bucks” 
rained down from the stands 
when the Buckeyes began the 
afternoon with a pair of dominant 
wins. After dropping the first two 
matches, 6-1 and 6-2, Michigan 
kept the scoreboard close in the 
last two. Despite the damage 
already being done, the hope 
of a quick turnaround injected 
life into the four remaining 
Wolverines’ 
teammates, 
who 
looked on from the neighboring 
courts.
Just when it looked like the 
ball was starting to bounce 
Michigan’s way, the Buckeyes 
slammed the door shut. The 
Wolverines’ 
rally 
aspirations 

took a blow when freshman 
Lanie Van Linge and sophomore 
Bella Lorenzini dropped their 
match, 7-5. Moments later, Ohio 
State clinched the sweep by 
toppling junior Giulia Pairone 
and freshman Anca Craciun, 7-6.
Bernstein’s 
cup 
of 
coffee 
certainly 
paid 
dividends. 
Saturday’s losing pairs were 
separated on Sunday and Monday, 
and 
the 
new 
partnerships 
propelled the Wolverines to 
a combined five doubles wins 
over No. 14 Georgia Tech and 
Tennessee.
Van Linge and junior Chiara 
Lommer stood out most among 
the 
new 
tandems, 
clicking 
instantly despite having little 
experience with each other.
“In college doubles, you need 
to be ready to play with any one 
of your teammates,” said senior 
Kate Fahey on Saturday.
The Van Linge-Lommer duo 
showed 
flashes 
of 
potential 
in a 7-5 win over Tennessee’s 
Johanna 
Silva 
and 
Rebeka 
Mertena on Sunday. Lommer’s 
left-handed serve and Van Linge’s 
quick reflexes at the net made the 
team’s serve tough to break, but 
Michigan’s hiccups on the serve 
receive kept the match close.
Monday presented the new 
partnership’s tallest task — a 
showdown with the 14th-ranked 
Yellow 
Jackets’ 
pairing 
of 

Nadia Gizdova and Dalila Said. 
With 
pressure 
mounting 
in 
the weekend’s final stages, Van 
Linge and Lommer played their 
best tennis of the young season. 
Behind Van Linge’s natural net 
instincts and Lommer’s heavy 
topspin forehand, the tandem 
put an exclamation point on 
the Wolverines’ night-and-day 
improvement with a convincing 
6-2 victory.
“I 
was 
happy 
with 
how 
the change went on Sunday 
and Monday,” Bernstein said. 
“Because we were more energetic, 
we were able to compete. (Our 
players) are so used to playing 
for themselves before they get 
here, so they need to figure out 
that energy piece and playing for 
a team. They’re hearing it a lot, 
and it was a completely different 
Sunday and Monday from what 
we saw Saturday.”
A weekend which began with 
a deafening slew of “Go Bucks” 
in Michigan’s home building 
during a painful sweep took a 
180-degree turn for the better. 
Monday’s success punctuated the 
team’s doubles improvement in 
encouraging fashion as “Go Blue” 
cheers echoed off the complex’s 
maize and blue championship 
banners.
In the end, a mere cup of coffee 
saved the Wolverines’ weekend 
from catastrophe.

‘M’ tops Michigan State, 30-10

Forty-one seconds. That’s all 
it took for redshirt junior Stevan 
Micic at the 133-pound weight 
class to reverse the momentum in 
Michigan’s favor during its Friday 
night dual against in-state rival 
Michigan State.
Micic attacked early and often, 
and by the 30-second mark of the 
match was halfway in on a single-
leg takedown. In an attempt to 
sprawl and evade being taken 
down, 
Micic’s 
opponent, 
the 
Spartans’ Anthony Tutolo, dove 
beneath 
him. 
Micic, 
sensing 
the opportunity in hand, took 
advantage, driving Tutolo to the 
mat and onto his back. Seconds 
later, the referee blew his whistle, 
and Micic had seized six team 
points, an early lead and the 
momentum.
Including Micic’s match, the 
fifth-ranked 
Wolverines 
(7-0 
overall, 3-0 Big Ten) cruised en 
route to six consecutive match 
wins, icing the dual in the process. 
After sophomore J.T. Correll at 
the 184-pound weight class was 
pinned, Michigan responded by 
squeezing out wins at 197 and 
heavyweight, finishing the dual 
with a 30-10 victory over Michigan 
State (4-5, 1-3).
“I really liked our team’s 

aggressive 
style 
of 
wrestling 
last night,” said Michigan coach 
Sean Bormet. “I thought we did 
a really good job of pressing our 
offense and extending ourselves 
throughout 
the 
entire 
seven 
minutes. It was a great dominating 
win.”
One particular wrestler who 
dominated for the Wolverines was 
a redshirt junior in the 165-pound 
weight class, Logan Massa, who 
scored nine takedowns, including 
four in the first period. Massa 
ended his bout with a 20-9 victory, 
securing four team points in the 
process.
Another 
bright 
spot 
was 
redshirt sophomore Kanen Storr 
at the 141-pound weight class, who 
flashed his prowess from the top 
position, and battled his way to a 
13-7 victory after falling behind 
3-0 in the first period.
“(His riding) is an area he is 
very capable in, and something 
that he has put a lot of work into, so 
to see him really commit himself 
to riding that kid, it really paid 
off,” Bormet said. “It was a big 
difference in that match.”
Also paying off has been the 
return of fifth-year senior Alec 
Pantaleo at the 157-pound weight 
class, who in his third match back 
from injury dominated en route to 
a 12-3 major decision. His presence 
at 157 has given Michigan a boost 

to its already vaunted lineup.
Though the match was officially 
a victory for the Wolverines 
following redshirt junior Myles 
Amine’s victory at the 174-pound 
weight 
class, 
redshirt 
junior 
Jackson Striggow’s match at the 
197-pound weight class provided 
quite the drama late.
Leading 6-4 (with 1:12 of riding 
time, which would add a point at 
the match’s end) with one second 
left in the third period, Striggow 
had a mental lapse, and was 
driven to his back for a two-point 
takedown 
immediately 
before 
time expired. Unaware of the 
riding time rule, the Spartan fans 
erupted, believing the match was 
headed to overtime, tied at six.
On the mat, Michigan State’s 
Brad Wilton knew his opponent 
had the riding time advantage, but 
believed he obtained a takedown 
with several seconds left on the 
clock, and thus deserved near-fall 
points. Upon further review, the 
officials determined that because 
time had expired, Wilton did not 
hold Striggow on his back for 
more than two seconds. Furious, 
Wilton hurried off the mat, while 
Striggow breathed a sigh of relief.
Reflecting on the match as a 
whole, Bormet could not help but 
be happy.
“It was fun,” Bormet said. “It 
was a dominating win.”

Fahey displays tenacity

Kate Fahey might have 
many 
attributes, 
accolades 
and awards to her name, but 
the senior Michigan women’s 
tennis player is arguably best 
defined by her determination 
to win.
This was clear during a 
disappointing 6-1 doubles loss 
with senior Brienne Minor at 
the Michigan Invitational on 
Saturday. Fahey’s frustration 
with her play, even slamming 
her racket on the court at 
one point, was obvious as the 
15th-ranked pair struggled to 
stay competitive with a lower-
ranked opponent.
“It was tough,” Fahey said. 
“They’re a good team but 
I think Bri and I definitely 
needed to compete better.”
Fahey, 
the 
third-ranked 
singles player in the country, 
had the opportunity to put 
the loss behind her with a win 
against an unranked opponent 
in Tennessee senior Sadie 
Hammond. While she was 
looking forward to coming 
back focused and ready to 
compete, Fahey quickly fell 
behind 0-3 in the first set.
“The first match of the 
season, I think everyone was 
a little bit nervous, especially 
coming out of doubles,” Fahey 
said. “The momentum was 

kind of on the other side.”
While some players may not 
have been able to overcome 
the 
early 
deficit, 
Fahey’s 
motivation to come back and 
win the match was clear. Her 
early struggles did not get in 
her head, and she continued to 
compete, tying the set 3-3 and 
eventually going on to lose a 
hard-fought set 6-7. Despite 
losing the set, Fahey shook off 
her early failures and returned 
to her typically dominant play, 
winning the final two sets 
and only dropping two games 
combined over that span.
“It was a tough first set and 
she let it go, and mentally was 
tough from the start of the 
second,” said Michigan coach 
Ronnie Bernstein. “So I think 
that’s 
the 
difference. 
She 
could’ve, after that first set, 
struggled a little bit mentally 
and not been positive, but I 
think that’s what turned it 
around.”
As Fahey’s play improved, 
so 
did 
her 
attitude. 
Her 
screams of “Come on!” after 
each point went from ones 
of frustration to motivation, 
getting louder as the points 
got bigger and keeping her 
focused on the task at hand.
“I’m a super competitive 
person,” 
Fahey 
said. 
“I 
definitely 
express 
my 
emotions 
a 
lot, 
everyone 
knows that. I think it helps 
me kind of because when I get 
within myself and I kind of 
shut down it definitely brings 
my level down. So I like to 
yell ‘Come on!’ I like to get 
pumped up.”
Added Bernstein: “When 
you have her on your side 
you’re in good shape. She’s the 
best competitor.”
Fahey 
finished 
the 
tournament 3-0 in singles 
with wins in straight sets on 
Sunday and Monday, and 1-2 
in doubles.
The final chapter of Fahey’s 
storied Michigan career has 
just begun, and Fahey just 
might be ready to lead the 
team to places it has never 
been.

WOMEN’S TENNIS

Michigan places second at Windy City Invitational

Justin Hopgood had competed 
just five times in his Michigan 
career.
In 2017 — his sophomore year 
— he competed four times on high 
bar, earning a high score of 14.40 
in his first-ever competition. Last 
year, he competed just once on 
floor exercise for the Wolverines.
But on Saturday, Hopgood 
stepped up to the high bar with 
Michigan looking for a hit routine. 
Michigan had earned a lackluster 
66.30 on parallel bars, with just 
two scores above the 12-point 
range. On the next rotation, high 
bar — Hopgood’s specialty — the 
Wolverines needed to get things 
back on track.
Hopgood 
calmly 
delivered 
to the tune of a 13.950 score for 
a clean routine that ended with 
a stuck dismount. And while 
Michigan 
competed 
on 
that 
apparatus early in the meet, his 
score held up throughout the rest 
of the meet, and he notched his 
second career event win.

In part thanks to Hopgood’s 
routine, the Wolverines went on to 
place second out of the six teams 
at the Windy City Invitational 
with a score of 402.00.
“It was surreal,” Hopgood 
said. “There’s really no feeling 
like that, hitting a great set and 
then finishing it off with a stuck 
dismount and then going back 
to a bench full of guys that had 
your back. There’s nothing that 
compares to that.”
Prior to Hopgood’s set on the 
high bar, Michigan struggled on 
parallel bars, its first event of the 
night. It was similar to last April at 
the NCAA Championships, when 
the Wolverines began the meet on 
parallel bars and put themselves 
in an insurmountable hole.
When faced with the choice 
of which event to start on at the 
Windy City Invitational, Michigan 
coach Kurt Golder decided to face 
the Wolverines’ demons head on 
and start on the parallel bars.
“We did a pretty decent job 
there,” Golder said. “Not fully 
what we’re capable of, not what 
we’ve done in practice, but we 

came away — that being our first 
event, usually you’ll see scores 
escalate throughout the meet, 
but one of our guys held for the 
first-place score, (junior) Mitchell 
Brown. We were really pleased 
with that.”
Brown 
has 
been 
a 
more 
consistent figure in the lineup 
than Hopgood, but his role is 
typically to contribute a clean, 
dependable routine — not to be 
one of Michigan’s highest scorers.
But when Brown took his turn 
on the parallel bars on Saturday, 
he flipped and swung his way to 
a score of 14.350, a career high 
and three-tenths of a point higher 
than the next closest competitor, 
sophomore Cameron Bock. The 
two Wolverines were the only 
gymnasts to score above 14.00 on 
the event.
“(Brown) has kind of been a 
regular for the last couple years, 
but never producing the super 
big scores,” Golder said. “For him 
to come out the champion, and 
particularly that being our first 
event, was really good.”
But 
Brown 
and 
Hopgood 

weren’t the only gymnasts who 
notched 
event-title 
wins 
on 
Saturday.
Sophomore Nick Guy’s score of 
14.50 on vault put him in a three-
way tie for first place on the event 
and broke his previous career high 
by a tenth.
Outside of the three event-
title wins — and Bock winning 
the all-around title — the nerves 
and jitters that come along with 
the first meet of the season 
reared their heads for Michigan. 
Multiple gymnasts fell or had 
other large mistakes, which left 
the Wolverines settling for second 
place rather than the meet win 
they felt they were capable of.
“I’d give us a B,” Golder said. 
“The one thing is, all the other 
teams had a competition before 
this. Usually, you get a lot of the 
bugs out between the first and 
second competition, so I think 
they were all at a little bit of an 
advantage to us.
“We hung in there with them, 
but like I said, you can never be 
satisfied if you could’ve won and 
you didn’t win.”

‘M’ looks to win on road

At home this season, the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team has won all eight of its 
contests.
On the road, it’s just 2-6.
Yes, the Wolverines have 
had 
a 
solid 
season 
thus 
far 
and 
find 
themselves 
squarely 
on 
the 
bubble 
for the NCAA 
Tournament, 
but road games 
have been their 
kryptonite. 
With 
recent 
losses 
at 
ranked 
opponents 
Maryland 
and 
Iowa, 
Michigan 
squandered 
two 
opportunities to boost its 
resume with victories away 
from Crisler Center.
With another road contest 
on the horizon Thursday 
night against Indiana, the 
Wolverines 
need 
to 
fix 
their road woes if they wish 
to return back to the Big 
Dance for the second year 
in a row under coach Kim 
Barnes 
Arico. 
A 
date 
with 
the 
unranked 
Hoosiers is the 
opportunity to 
right the ship.
Michigan’s 
players 
don’t see the 
upcoming bout 
against Indiana 
— 
which 
is 
currently 
projected 
to 
make 
the 
NCAA Tournament — as a 
daunting task. In the end, it 
appears that the team is more 
concerned 
about 
staying 
together and taking the Big 
Ten gauntlet one game at a 
time.
“It’s 
definitely 
different 
going 
to 
someone 
else’s 
house with their crowd,” 
said freshman forward Naz 

Hillmon. “In those moments 
we just really need to be a 
team and lock in and cheer 
for each other.”
Hillmon, 
who 
had 
20 
points and eight rebounds in 
Sunday’s 62-58 victory over 
Ohio State, has emerged as 
a key contributor along with 
freshman guard Amy Dilk. 
The two were 
instrumental 
in sparking a 
fourth-quarter 
comeback, 
something 
that the team 
had failed to 
do against the 
Terrapins and 
Hawkeyes.
“(That 
win 
showed) 
us 
that we can do it,” Hillmon 
said. “When we’re down, 
we’re going to know that 
we can get back in the game 
or we know that teams can 
do it to us so it’s a learning 
experience either way for us.”
Added 
senior 
forward 
Taylor Rooks: “We’re showing 
growth. 
We’re 
learning 
how to play 40 minutes and 
keeping our intensity all the 
way to the end of the fourth 
quarter.”
Senior 
forward Nicole 
Munger knows 
that 
every 
game left on 
the 
schedule 
will 
be 
a 
battle, but she 
knows that the 
team is hungry 
and ready to 
take 
on 
any 
opponent, even if it’s away 
from the friendly confines of 
Crisler.
“Every game in the Big Ten 
is gonna be like this,” she 
said. “It’s gonna be a grinder. 
We try to stay hungry and 
keep attacking each day, try 
to get a little bit better.”
If 
Michigan 
wants 
to 
achieve its goals, that starts 
Thursday.

O

n Saturday, then-No. 2 
Michigan went into the 
Kohl Center and was 
repeatedly stymied. It was a 
frustrating afternoon that saw 
the Wolver-
ines shoot just 
40.7 percent 
from the field, 
score a season-
low 54 points 
and drop their 
first game of 
the season.
But despite 
the woeful 
offensive 
performance, 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
remained unconcerned — at least 
outwardly. The loss, he insisted, 
was a product of Wisconsin’s 
stifling defense. Though Beilein 
made sure to remind reporters 
that he never wants to lose, it 
was seen as a welcome opportu-
nity for the Wolverines to reflect 
and improve after two months of 
straightforward wins.
“Credit Wisconsin, they had 
a great game plan defensively,” 
Beilein said. “They made us 
score over them, like Wisconsin 
teams always do. … So it’s just a 
typical loss to Wisconsin.”
And for three days after the 
loss to the Badgers, that line of 
reasoning held water. Wisconsin 
ranks ninth in adjusted defense 
and has allowed just four oppo-
nents to top 70 points this sea-
son.
Then, Minnesota came to 
town.
Wisconsin is objectively good 
at defense. Minnesota is not, 
ranking 12th in the Big Ten in 
adjusted defensive efficiency.
And still, Michigan couldn’t 
score. For over two months, 
the Wolverines had not dipped 
below 60 points in a game. On 
Tuesday, they did so for the sec-
ond time in four days.
This time, Michigan escaped 
with the win, thanks to a base-
line jumper by redshirt junior 
forward Charles Matthews 
that beat the final horn by mil-
liseconds. But despite the win, 
Beilein’s postgame presser car-
ried a much different tone.

“We gotta grow a lot,” he said. 
“We gotta grow a lot. We lost 
a 13-point lead late. How many 
times do you see that happen at 
Michigan, where we let it go like 
that?”
Beilein was, of course, refer-
ring to the four-minute, 51-sec-
ond scoreless stretch before 
Matthews’ buzzer-beater, in 
which the Wolverines went 
0-for-6 from the field and missed 
a pair of free throws. But that 
sentence — How many times do 
you see that happen at Michi-
gan? — could be used to describe 
to any number of stretches from 
the past two games.
It could describe the 2:52 
Michigan went before scoring 
its first point Tuesday. Or the 18 
minutes the Wolverines went 
without hitting a 3-pointer down 
the stretch. Or the nine-minute 
stretch of Saturday’s second 
half when they scored just five 
points, allowing a four-point 
lead to become a six-point defi-
cit.
“We definitely didn’t play 
our best game,” said freshman 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis on 
Tuesday. “And 
(Beilein) let us 
know about that 
for sure.”
The big-
ger problem, 
though, is that 
Michigan has 
no discernable 
solution. On Sat-
urday, Beilein 
attributed 
the offensive 
woes to his team’s 16 turnovers. 
Against Minnesota, the Wolver-
ines slashed that number to six, 
but were equally unimpressive, 
undone by a lack of ball move-
ment.
“The ball’s stuck a lot and the 
ball’s not moving,” Beilein said, 
when asked to diagnose Michi-
gan’s struggles.
Then, he paused and offered 
up the type of candidness that he 
has rarely needed to display this 
season.
“And here’s another thing, 
the fast break. Sometimes, fast 
break, we shouldn’t even do 

it. Cause we’re jogging up the 
court, we gotta sprint. We don’t 
run. (Minnesota’s) numbers in 
defensive transition, they’re not 
great. But we jog up the court 
and so, we can’t do it. So this is 
what they get, you end up get-
ting scores in the 50s and 60s if 
you’re not willing to bust your 
butt to get up the court.”
That sloppiness on the fast 
break reared its head on Tues-
day, when junior guard Zavier 
Simpson threw a pass away in 
transition, allowing the Golden 
Gophers to curb 
an 11-point Wol-
verines’ run and 
kickstart their 
13-point come-
back. Against 
Wisconsin, it was 
sophomore for-
ward Isaiah Liv-
ers who couldn’t 
find Matthews a 
2-on-1 fast break 
that would have 
put Michigan up by five with 
8:41 to play. The Wolverines 
never led by more than one 
again.
But even when Michigan 
checked its sloppiness at the 
door and moved the ball like 
Beilein wants it to, it couldn’t 
find bottom.
At one point midway through 
the first half, trying to cut into a 
nine-point deficit, the Wolver-
ines ping-ponged the ball around 
the perimeter, from sophomore 
guards Eli Brooks and Jordan 
Poole to Matthews and, finally, 
to Brazdeikis in the corner. It 

was their best offensive posses-
sion to that point, but as soon as 
Brazdeikis — who was shooting 
42 percent from deep just five 
games ago — released, he took 
two quick hops of resignation, 
instantly knowing that he had 
missed his ninth three in a row, 
dating back to Jan. 10 at Illinois.
It ended up as one of six 
missed threes for Brazdei-
kis, who finished 1-for-7 from 
beyond the arc and 4-for-18 
overall — part of a 3-for-22 team 
performance from deep.
“We just gotta make them 
when we’re open,” Beilein said. 
“Some of our guys aren’t getting 
open, it’s because they’re chang-
ing the basketball rules, saying 
we don’t care. Wisconsin took 
a player and just face guarded 
one of our players. And he didn’t 
have any help D, but that was the 
thing, ‘this guy’s not getting a 
look.’ And they’re making other 
people do it. And every game is 
different how they play us.”
Then, a reporter brought 
Beilein back to his comments 
after the Wisconsin loss, when 
he called the loss a teaching 
opportunity.
Were you expecting more 
growth?
Beilein, again, had no choice 
but to be candid.
“I was. I was. … Probably 
foolish of me to think, ‘Geez, we 
watched two days of film and it’s 
just gonna carry over.’ ”

Wolverines meet Nittany Lions 
with both teams at a crossroads

 At the beginning of the season, 
Michigan was ranked fourth in 
the country and Penn State was 
ranked fifth. Now, the Nittany 
Lions are last in the Big Ten, with 
the Wolverines only one point 
ahead of them.
Out of all the teams in the tight 
Big Ten this year, there might 
not be two with more similar 
season-long trajectories meeting 
than when the Wolverines and 
the Nittany Lions face off at Yost 
Ice Arena Thursday and on the 
national stage at Madison Square 
Garden on Saturday.
When the two teams split 
November’s series at State College, 
Michigan found itself in a sizeable 
hole in each matchup through the 
first two periods. But in the blink 
of an eye, the Wolverines racked 
up a four-goal third period to win 
the first game, and another one to 
send it to overtime in the second, 
only to watch Penn State’s Nikita 
Pavlychev score six ticks into the 
extra period.
At that point, the Nittany Lions 
seemed set. With college hockey’s 
most dominant offense and All-
American candidates like Evan 
Barratt and Alex Limoges, Penn 
State seemed destined to establish 

itself as one of the best teams in 
the Big Ten. 
But since then, Penn State and 
Michigan are 4-7-2 and 2-4-6, 
respectively, since that roller-
coaster of a series. After lurking 
around the top 10 of the Pairwise, 
the Nittany Lions find themselves 
at 18th. Like the Wolverines at 
the beginning of the season, 
Frozen Four hopes were not an 
unrealistic ideal. But also like 
Michigan, it’s on the outside 
looking in.
“They’re a good team,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“They can score a lot, they’ve 
scored 40 more goals than us 
on the year. I was looking at it — 
they’re dangerous. Just because 
they have an off-week or month 
doesn’t mean they’re not still 
dangerous. … It’s been a shot here 
and a bounce there, we’ve actually 
played pretty good. You can look 
at the record and say that’s not 
true, but a few breaks and bounces 
here and everything is different.”
The parallels don’t end just 
quite there. To Michigan’s loss of 
sophomore forward Josh Norris 
to an undisclosed tear suffered 
at World Juniors, Penn State 
can raise its own World Juniors-
induced loss of freshman forward 
Aarne Talvitie and his 16 points.
The 
difference? 
The 

Wolverines have been here before 
— and it shows. When they lost 
then-sophomore forward Will 
Lockwood for the season last year, 
they still rebounded and found a 
way to get hot. Since losing Norris, 
Michigan has started a similar 
momentum with top-10 wins over 
Ohio State and Notre Dame.
“(Penn State’s) going through 
what we’ve had the last couple of 
years,” Pearson said. “Now they 
haven’t had that before, I don’t 
know how they’re going to handle 
it, but it’s a similar situation.”
To vault back up into the top 
of the Pairwise, both teams need 
this series to be more than a 
mirror of their inconsistent last 
one-and-a-half months. Michigan 
had a chance to sweep Ohio State, 
but let it slip through. But for all 
of the Wolverines’ blunders and 
inconsistencies, they still have a 
chance to be where they want to 
be.
“Even if they’re 8-4-4, if we 
play our game, we’re going to be 
fine,” Pearson said. “And that’s 
what we need to make sure 
we’re doing, all the little things 
we need to do to have success. … 
We’ve been in every game since 
November 9th.”
Getting back to the promised 
land, though, will mean more 
than just being on track.

It’s definitely 
different going 
to someone 
else’s house.

A body of art is a sum of a 
thousand twisting gears moving 
together 
in 
simultaneous 
harmony. Everything must be 
perfectly in order for the final 
piece to be complete. Among 
the most important gears in this 
elaborate machine are space 
(the location in which the art 
takes place), people to witness 
the art and, most of the time, 
funding for the art to be made. 
While the artists themselves are 
vital to fueling the art machine, 
arts 
administrators 
are 
the 
machine’s main source of power. 
Arts 
administrators 
provide 
the ammunition so the three 
important gears listed above can 
move easily side by side.
“It was thrilling. It was 
terrifying. 
And 
still 
is,” 
Literati Bookstore owner Mike 
Gustafson said about opening 
the store in downtown Ann 
Arbor. The venue is home to 
hundreds of books and monthly 
literature events. When I asked 
Gustafson if he found support 
in the Ann Arbor community 
now, years after he and his wife 
realized their dream of opening 
up an independent bookstore, 
he didn’t hesitate to praise the 
community.
“The 
wonderful 
thing 
about Ann Arbor is, we didn’t 
have to invent the ‘buy local’ 
wheel,” he said, “There was 
and is a very strong ‘buy local’ 
movement and culture here in 
Ann Arbor, and we are one little 
aspect of that. This community 
values local businesses and its 
independent mindset.” Although 
the community values local 
business, that doesn’t mean 
his work is easy by any means. 
“Every year, we have to reinvent 
ourselves internally: staffing, 
communication, our own roles 
as owners. But the original 
passion — to be a bookstore that 
helps people find books that 
can change lives — remains the 
same.” Gustafson’s impassioned 
attitude does not simply apply to 
booksellers and stores. It is this 
passion for the art itself that all 
arts administrators share.
During my interview with 
Mary Steffek Blaske, executive 
director of the Ann Arbor 
Symphony 
Orchestra, 
the 
passion she had for both the 
music and the administration 
behind the orchestra pulsated 
through the room. “You need 
to have both hats. A hat of a 
for-profit with the heart of a 
non-profit. You’re running a 
business,” she said. “It’s amazing 
to work with a spirit that wants 
to be creative and serving people 
that way. You need to have the 
mechanisms that want to make it 
happen. There are so many layers 
— we are all working together. 
Whether it’s the orchestra, the 
musicians on stage, the board 
and the audience. We have to 
be working together. The artists 
know that we can’t do it without 
them and we can’t do it without 
us either.”
Steffek 
Blaske 
smiled 
at 
me, her eyes glimmering with 
confidence 
in 
the 
seamless 
process of art creation. While 
her passion for the orchestra was 
riveting to witness, it also made 

me a bit melancholic. I hear of 
people going to football games all 
the time, but the phrase, “Want 
to go to the orchestra?” isn’t 
tossed around in nearly enough 
of my conversations. When I 
expressed this concern to her, 
she shook her head knowingly.
“Arts 
and 
culture 
in 
Washtenaw County fill up the 
Michigan Stadium more times 
in a season than the football 
does,” Steffek Blaske said. “We 
are hard-wired as human beings 
to make sounds, to make sounds 
together. Even if it’s sitting here 

at a coffee shop hearing the 
music, the voices. Going to a 
concert and watching this story 
happen with sound is beautiful. 
It’s something people don’t want 
to miss out on.”
However, 
bringing 
people 
in to witness the orchestra 
takes a certain type of strategic 
planning. 
Administratively, 
she explained to me that the 
orchestra 
tries 
to 
draw 
in 
people from every stage of 
life. They do this through 
niche 
programming. 
The 
orchestra puts on programming 
specifically 
meant 
for 
elementary, middle and high 
schoolers as well as concerts for 
the elderly and everywhere in 
between.
I asked her to delve further 

into her children’s programs, 
and her face lit up with joy. “It’s 
so important to have artistic 
education engagements. To give 
kids, who are like sponges, this 
gift, which they might have not 
been able to find on their own,” 
she said. “Exposing kids to 
artistic works at an early age has 
the potential to inspire them to 
create art of their own.”
And again, the balancing act 
of a fiery passion or a “non-profit 
heart” overcame Steffek Blaske. 
“It’s about humanity and making 
everybody have a chance to be 
their best selves,” she said. Soon 
enough, though, her “for-profit” 
hat was quickly donned. “And all 
this sounds great but, because 
of the way arts are structured, 
they need to be funded. That is 
why you need the organizational 
savvy of arts administrators,” she 
said. “How do you make the two 
circles, artist and administrator, 
intersect in a Venn diagram? 
This is real meaningful work. 
You need the board to be out 
there letting people know that 
what we do has value.”
Funding is a huge part of arts 
administration and the creation 
of arts in general. As much as 
we’d like to create everything 
our imagination can think of, a 
lot of this can only be done if we 
possess the proper funding.
Mary Cambruzzi, owner of 
Kerrytown store Found which 
features art made from recylced 
materials, told me about her 
attention to funding. “With 
a store this size, you have to 
have enough product turning 
over all the time in order to 
have the numbers work,” she 
said. Cambruzzis focus on the 
numbers allows Found to be 
successful. The store expands 
each year with new products and 
artisans.
Cambruzzi said it can be 
difficult to pursue artists and 
ideas because she is also trying to 
run the business. “At some point, 
I hit a stride about six or seven 
years into it ... Where we were 
constantly evolving what we 
had, I had a good sense of what’s 
going to sell and what isn’t,” she 
said. Similar to the passion of the 
artists whose work she chooses 
to sell in her store, Cambruzzi 
holds a deep sense of passion 
for her work with administering 
arts. “With Found, you have a 
person you can count on to care 
about the stuff they’re putting 
in their space. I care about the 
stuff, whether it’s imported or 
from Ann Arbor, I care deeply 
about the stuff we put in our 
space,” she said. 
Caring deeply is a common 
thread I found in all three 
of these arts administrators. 
Crunching numbers, publicizing 
and strategizing allow the deep 
care to be illuminated for all 
to 
see. 
Arts 
administration 
requires an individual who is 
quick on their toes and who 
has 
great 
personable 
skills. 
And most importantly, who 
cares deeply about the finished 
work. The gears of a piece of 
art are endlessly shifting and 
molding to fit into one another. 
It is under the oversight of arts 
administrators that these gears 
move smoothly in order to 
create a well-oiled final artistic 
machine.

B-SIDE

White walls have made way 
for white screens as Instagram 
has replaced the art exhibit 
or high fashion store as the 
public’s primary mode of art 
consumption. While at one time 
the art consumer was forced to 
move from one work to another 
in clockwise fashion around a 
room, the Instagram user can 
take any number of paths from 
one item to the next through 
tags, likes, follow suggestions, 
etc., in a never-ending loop of 
promotion. In this way, the art 
consumer is never independent 
of the material consumer.
One man who was cognizant 
of this long before the days 
of 
Instagram 
is 
Japanese 
artist Takashi Murakami (@
takashipom). 
Throughout 
his 
career, Murakami has taken 
elements 
of 
traditional 
and 
contemporary 
Japanese 
pop 
culture 
and 
incorporated 
them 
into 
his 
recognizable 
cartoon-style graphics (you may 
recognize his work — it first came 
into American consciousnesses 
through 
Kanye 
West’s 
Graduation cover art). These 
graphics have been produced and 
reproduced in so many contexts 
over the years that one begins 
to question where one draws the 
line between art and commodity. 
The only thing that outpaces 
Murakami’s art is his Instagram. 
He’s now made over 7,000 posts, 
and it doesn’t take much scrolling 

to find similarly inclined artists 
on his feed.
One such artist is Virgil 
Abloh, founder of Off-White 
and now creative director of 
Louis Vuitton’s ready-to-wear 
menswear 
collection. 
“My 
brand started in the alleys 
of the internet,” Abloh told 
The Guardian in 2018. Unlike 
Murakami, who came to adapt 
to the newfound power of social 
media, Abloh’s success is solely 
dependent on its capabilities. 
Abloh’s trademark creation to 
date is the addition of bold, all-
caps Helvetica Neue words in 
quotation marks to clothing, 
furniture and art for this brand 
Off-White. While the point of 
this was to highlight the deceitful 
nature of marketing and the 
superficiality of consumerism, 
the internet has powered these 
items to never-before-seen levels 
of hype and blind consumption. 
With nothing but a knack for 
popular culture and a bad social 
media habit (plus a masters in 
architectural design), Abloh rose 
himself up through the ranks 
from being an intern at Fendi to 
being the head of menswear at 
what could possibly be the world’s 
“it” fashion brand. Though he 
may be 38 and married, Abloh 
now flies nearly every day to and 
from offices, DJ sets (you get paid 
to have the aux when you’re head 
of Off-White and Louis Vuitton), 
and fashion shows as one of 
the many entrepreneurs of our 
generation’s catered interests.
To 
supplement 
this 
interconnected online market 

of fashion, art and music are 
companies like Complex and 
Highsnobiety, who make their 
money 
hiring 
20-somethings 
to follow the daily activities 
of influencers like Abloh and 
Murakami 
(seriously, 
what 
must their employees do all 
day?). On top of their main 
Instagram 
accounts, 
which 
tally 3.8 million and 2.6 million 
followers 
respectively, 
each 
has a variety of side accounts 
like @highsnobietydesign and 
@complexsneakers 
that 
tally 
upwards of a million followers 
each 
as 
well. 
These 
pages 
maximize the likelihood that 
you will find these companies 
through some path on the 
internet (like sports? Find @
complexsports on your discover 
feed) and view their posts. 
It 
doesn’t 
matter 
whether 
Instagram indicates that these 
are ads or not.
No matter the reason we follow 
these pages, each and every post 
makes some sort of plug that at 
the end of the day aims to have 
us buy something. Yes, there’s 
always been a tension in art 
between design and commodity, 
but never to the extent that we 
see it today. While the exchange 
of art and high fashion was once 
an activity reserved for the elite, 
it now permeates all levels of 
society. Although it seems that 
creators like Abloh are genuinely 
invested in their designs, we must 
always question the sincerity of 
companies that solely produce 
and share products catered to the 
masses.

“All I Want”

Broken Social Scene

Arts & Crafts

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘ALL I WANT’

“All I Want,” released Jan. 
22, is the first single from the 
Toronto-based Broken Social 
Scene’s upcoming EP Let’s 
Try the After — Vol. 1. The 
track has a warm, dreamy, 
almost 
oversaturated 
tone 
in 
line 
with 
their 
most 
recent 
album 
Hug 
of Thunder. It bursts with 
urgent creativity, as though 
the band is rushing to fit as 
many ideas as possible into 
a single song. Broken Social 
Scene has always had a 
knack for creating a cohesive 
whole out of bizarre sounds, 
making the dissonant sound 
harmonious. The group has 
not lost its touch on this front 
quite yet, managing to make 

a distortion-heavy track feel 
like a balmy summer day. The 
experimental elements are 
made natural, and the whole 

package goes down easy.
However, 
while 
“All 
I 
Want” is enjoyable, it lacks 
that same gravity that we 
know Broken Social Scene 
is 
capable 
of 
producing. 
Most Broken Social Scene 

songs 
forcibly 
command 
your attention; they grab you 
by the lapels and dare you 
to stop listening. Instead, 
“All I Want” ambles by, 
pleasant and unremarkable. 
It’s not particularly catchy 
or memorable, almost as if 
you spend the whole time 
waiting for the song to really 
kick in. For any other band, 
“All I Want” would be a very 
encouraging single release. 
For Broken Social Scene, it 
feels like stagnation.

Thursday, January 24, 2019 — 3B

When I returned to school 
after winter break in elementary 
school, there was only one thing 
on everyone’s minds: What sort of 
gifts did everyone get? Everyone 
seemed to be interested in 
seeing if their presents were as 
cool as everyone else’s. In fifth 
grade, my good friend Tyler 
and I had each received iPod 
Nanos. However, there was one 
difference between our two 
devices — while I had about 
forty songs on my iPod (Radio 
Disney Kid Jams Vol. 1 and 2), 
Tyler had hundreds.
I didn’t know it at the time, 
but there was no way Tyler was 
listening to all of those songs as 
a fifth grader. But either way, 
I was jealous. I wanted to have 
more songs on my iPod. So after 
asking Tyler about how he got 
all of those songs on his iPod, I 
learned about a website called 
Limewire where you could (or 
as I understood it), “Download 
songs for free.” And so began 
my relationship with music and 
instant gratification.
Music streaming has been 
almost 
seamlessly 
integrated 
into our everyday lives. And 
with this emergence of a new 

way to access music comes 
those arguing for and against 
that method. Many claim that 
streaming services hurt the 
artists, while others think that 
it allows listeners to experience 
much more music than ever 
before.
Both sides are right, in some 
respect, but the argument that 
the artists are losing money 
from 
streaming 
services 
is 
only partially correct: Artists 
that relinquish control of their 
streaming 
rights 
to 
labels 
are 
really 
the 
ones 
losing 
out. Relying on an internet-
based music platform without 
adapting to an internet-based 
plan of making, producing and 
serving music is not a recipe for 
success. With increased ease to 
produce and release music due to 
advancements in technology and 
the proliferation of the internet 
and 
an 
increased 
demand 
for instant gratification from 
consumers, the need for artists 
to have a label is becoming 
almost irrelevant.
One of the most famous 
examples of an independent 
artist is Chancelor Bennett, or, 
as he’s more commonly known, 
Chance the Rapper. Bennett 
started by releasing his debut 
mixtape, 10 Day, to the world, 
garnering upwards of 500,000 

downloads 
on 
the 
mixtape 
sharing site DatPiff. After being 
recognized as one of the most 
prolific up-and-coming artists 
by publications like Complex 
and Forbes, Bennett released 
his second mixtape, Acid Rap, in 
2013 to even more widespread 
acclaim 
than 
his 
previous 
mixtape.
However even after achieving 
such a high level of success 
and working with artists like 
Childish 
Gambino, 
Kanye 
West 
and 
Kendrick 
Lamar, 
getting millions of streams on 
streaming services, and selling 
out stadiums across the country, 
Bennett 
continues 
to 
stay 
independent. When asked if he 
would ever sign with a label in 
an interview with Rolling Stone, 
Bennett replied, “There’s no 
reason to. It’s a dead industry.”
A lesser known but still 
very familiar artist is Claire 
Cottrill, better known by her 
stage name, Clairo. Although 
Cottrill is now signed to Fader, 
a record label based in New 
York City, and has also been 
accused of being an “industry 
plant,” her initial success can be 
completely attributed to herself 
and websites like YouTube and 
Bandcamp. When I first saw 
Cottrill’s music video for her 
song “Pretty Girl” on YouTube 

in late August of 2017, it had a 
couple hundred thousand views. 
Now, the video has surpassed 26 
million views on YouTube, and 
although the single wasn’t added 
to streaming services until a 
short while after the videos 
initial release, the track has over 
34 million streams on Spotify. All 
for a track produced completely 
by Cottrill on equipment she 
described as, “pretty shitty.”
Although she has only been 
signed to a label within the past 
two years, one can see music 
released 
from 
Cottrill 
from 
as far back as 2013 on various 
online platforms. From covers 
to originals, Cottrill has the 
freedom to post whatever she 
wanted for everyone to listen to. 
And although she’s been accused 
of being a sellout many times, the 
consistency in sound of Cottrill’s 
music begs to differ.
Sites 
like 
Bandcamp, 
Soundcloud and YouTube have 
allowed artists like Clairo to 
release their music to the world 
without going through a label. 
Although this can give artists a 
lot of freedom and options for 
their music, it also complicates 
things a bit. Because these 
services exist to artists for 
basically no cost, and home 
recording is becoming a cheaper 
and 
cheaper 
activity 
(many 
current 
computers 
including 
multitrack recording software 
upon launch), basically anyone 
can release music.
Like, anyone.
With all of this music being 

released, it’s not surprising to 
see how saturated the music 
industry has become. Every 
minute, twelve hours of music 
are uploaded to Soundcloud. 
That’s a lot of music. The amount 
of new music that people have 
not heard yet continues to grow 
at a rate that is unachievable for 
the average listener to catch up 
to.
So how do listeners decide 
which new artists they want 
to discover? The purpose of 
a record label used to be to 
produce artists’s records and 
then promote them. Well, artists 
are already capable of producing 
their own work, so how has 
this new age of the internet and 
technology influenced that? Are 
labels still necessary for that?
Well … sort of.
While it’s true that labels 
might have more money to 
promote 
artists 
and 
send 
them on tour, artists are still 
fully 
capable 
of 
marketing 
themselves, and even booking 
their own tours. Social media 
has completely revolutionized 
the way we communicate with 
each other and has changed 
the way we advertise as well. 
It’s now easier than ever to 
reach billions of people that are 
connected online for free or 
close to it.
The DIY music scene and its 
continued emergence in culture 
exemplifies the ease of self-
promoting and booking in the 
21st century. Countless student-
run bands from Ann Arbor 

have put on tours of their own, 
traveling across the Midwest 
and beyond without the help of 
a label; simply asking friends if 
they know anywhere they can 
play is enough of a start for them 
to go on tour.
But self-funded shows go a 
lot further than DIY basement 
shows. Bands can easily book 
their own national tours, and 
even fund them. Sites like 
GoFundMe 
and 
IndieGoGo 
make it possible for bands 
to raise funds for tours on a 
grander scale.

Ann Arbor favorite Vulfpeck 
figured out a way to fund a 
national tour back in 2014 using 
resources that would have only 
been available to them in the 
internet age. By uploading an 
album of silence to Spotify, 
asking their fans to stream 
it while they sleep and then 
using the money made through 
streaming to fund a tour, the 
group was able to fund a tour 
that was completely free to fans 
spanning from Los Angeles to 
New York.
A 
musical 
artist’s 
metaphorical tool belt continues 
to grow and grow each and 
every year. The more resources 
they have, the less they need 
a label and the more they can 
focus on expanding their brand 
on their own terms. Consulting 
professionals can still be helpful, 
but the need for artists to sign 
daunting and binding contracts 
is just not there anymore.

Like it or not, celebrities 
play a pivotal role in our 
society. Whether it’s to take a 
stand politically or to promote 
a controversial diet, there’s 
no doubt that they have an 
extensive influence on the way 
we live our lives and how we 
fill our time. Consequently, it’s 
no surprise that their impact 
reaches beyond our screens and 
into the books we read.
In 
1996, 
the 
publishing 
industry saw a drastic shift in 
the way books were marketed to 

the world with the introduction 
of Oprah Winfrey’s book club. 
The program ran for 15 years 
and many of the books went on 
to become bestsellers, certain 
titles selling over 1 million 
copies. Since then, celebrities 
everywhere have joined the book 
club craze: Reese Witherspoon 
and Jimmy Fallon both have 
prominent clubs of their own, 
and the books they endorse have 
had similar successes.
It shouldn’t be a surprise to 
anyone that the books celebrities 
enjoy 
and 
publicly 
support 
experience 
positive 
public 
feedback. What’s concerning 
is the fact that authors and 

books may suffer because of the 
individual tastes of the people 
directing what the public is 
reading. One economist pointed 
out that while Oprah favored 
certain classic books, the sales 
of genres like romance and 
mystery tended to suffer from 
her directed interests because 
the public was simply busy 
reading something else.
Balancing a book’s role as a 
product while remaining true 
to the art form is difficult, 
especially in a world where 
people are ever more distracted 
by 
their 
phones 
and 
the 
newest 
thing 
on 
television. 
While 
celebrities 
can 
often 

be the bridge between these 
two 
worlds, 
their 
constant 
advertisements pushing this or 
that book can change the way 
we perceive the text. The book 
becomes increasingly more like 
a product someone is trying 

to sell, instead of a piece of art 
meant to help us understand the 
world. And maybe it could be 
argued that books have always 

been products, that publishers 
have always been trying to push 
the sales of their new book, 
but 
celebrity 
endorsements 
seem to emphasize this point, 
rather 
than 
draw 
attention 
away from it. Often times, with 
their fans being such a reverent 
audience, their opinions become 
muddled with “expertise” and 
their 
recommendations 
with 
principles. Eventually, the books 
that are promoted lose the very 
individuality that made them 
appealing to the celebrities in 
the first place.
Creating a book club is an 
art in itself, a potential key to 
understanding a difficult text 
or 
cultivating 
relationships 
one might not otherwise make. 
But clubs on such a wide scale, 
like that of Oprah’s book club, 
take on a corporate quality and 
lose the intimacy that makes 
reading a book with a group of 
people so enjoyable. On a local 
level, Ann Arbor’s own Literati 
Bookstore runs a variety of book 
clubs that present an interesting 
understanding of the way a 
book acts as both a catalyst 
for relations and discussions 
while also remaining a lucrative 
product for the store. It’s a 
perfect marriage: The monthly 
clubs provide a platform for 
Literati to advertise their store 
and their books while the 
local atmosphere of the coffee 
shop preserves the personal 
connection 
between 
books 
and people, overall avoiding 
the downfalls that come with 
celebrity endorsements.
None of this is to say that 
celebrities are without their 
good 
intentions. 
They’ve 
changed 
the 
publishing 
landscape and the way we 
experience books — we can 
connect not only with each 
other but with our favorite 
stars through the books they 
read. Nevertheless, while the 
clubs are meant to encourage 

reading and can often have a 
positive impact on book sales, 
their prevalence marks a society 
that yearns to confirm the idea 
that “Stars, they’re just like 
us.” We shouldn’t rely solely 
on Emma Roberts or Sarah 
Jessica Parker to tell us what 
books we should or should not 
read. Part of the experience of 
reading is browsing a bookstore 
or a library and stumbling on 
an up-and-coming author or an 

old classic that may or may not 
have a huge following. Even 
recommendations are integral 
to the process of finding a book 
— it’s when books undergo 
mass marketing, with the help 
of celebrities, that the real 
threat is evident. The process of 
reading is a personal experience 
and, if people continue to rely as 
heavily as they do on celebrities 
for 
book 
recommendations, 
books 
stand 
to 
lose 
the 
very thing that makes them 
marketable.

When 
you 
walk 
through 
the Stephen M. Ross School of 
Business, a lot of things may 
catch your eye. Perhaps it’s the 
flock of sharply-dressed men, 
unwavering and determined, 
barreling 
forward 
to 
an 
unknown destination. Or maybe 
it is the brazen coloring that 
targets your eye like a harsh ray 
of sunlight – orange paneling, 
yellow bricks and blue windows 
eerily mirroring not the colors 
of Michigan but the electric 
uniforms of Stephen Ross’s 
Miami Dolphins. And maybe, 
just maybe, it’s the bizarre 
interior design of the school 
— 
hanging 
cyndrilic 
lights 
and zig-zagging staircases to 
nowhere that are as if someone 
had a fourth grader read Kurt 
Vonnegut and then draw what it 
made them feel.
I admit I am a bit of a 
hypocrite for poking fun at the 
atmosphere of Ross; I study 
there more than anywhere else 
on campus (though in large part 
to the fact there is a Starbucks, 
a cafè and it is a five-minute 
walk from my apartment). And 
for me, everytime I enter the 
extensive building there is one 
thing that draws my attention 
more than anything else listed 
above: the art. Yes, believe it 
or not, Ross is full of art. Two-
hundred and fifty pieces of it 
to be exact. It is hard to notice 
the collection, especially after 
a seven-hour bender in the 
Winter Garden that leaves your 
eyes feeling like they got the “A 
Clockwork Orange” treatment. 
But it’s there, in all of its beauty, 
irony and oftentimes weirdness, 
art permeates Ross from floor to 
ceiling. 
I will begin with the horses. 
You have to know the ones — 
beasts of welded steel protecting 
the 
entrance 
to 
Robertson 
Auditorium, a room named 
after the very man who gifted 
these impressive brutes. The 
horses are a duo, one is titled 
“Forgetting the Other” and 
the other “With the Current.” 
I love these horses, I really do. 

Not only are they the result of 
extreme horse-girl syndrome 
(Deborah Butterfield, the artist, 
said “I knew when I saw my 
first horse that it was the most 
important being on earth”), 
but they’re really fucking cool. 
Giant horses made of steel? 
How hardcore is that? I like to 
think they come alive at night 
à la “Night at the Museum” and 
gallop freely through the empty 
halls until sunlight returns 
them to their permanent home. 
Journey past the magnificent 
beasts to the water fountain next 
to the Starbucks and you will be 
greeted by a series of sketches 
and drawings by California 
artist Chris Johanson. Entitled 
“Perceptions,” 
the 
pictures 
depict humans, ants, bottles 
and other objects accompanied 
by 
phrases 
like 
“PLEASE 
STOP 
YOUR 
HORRIBLE 
WAYS EARTH PEOPLE” and 
“IT IS HAPPENING RIGHT 
NOW, ACT NOW.” The irony 
in these pictures being hung 
in a business school at the 
University of Michigan comes 
flowing in heavily from every 
direction. 
Johanson 
wanted 
to make the sketches look like 
kids drew them because, as 
he said, “I hated school, and I 
hated education.” Johanson’s 
work is also seen as a critique 
on advertising and capitalism — 
need I say more?
As we walk out of Ross and 
into the Blau building, may I turn 
your attention to the man who 
made this all possible. A portrait 
of Stephen M. Ross hangs not 
from every rafter of the ceiling 
and above every doorway as 
you may expect, but rather in a 
humble corner in the lobby of 
the building. I have witnessed 
many a misidentification of Mr. 
Ross, from a poor, confused 
boy commenting that he didn’t 
think Bill Gates looked like 
that to a young girl proclaiming 
“Grandpa!” as she pointed at 
the image (though honestly, 
that may have been his actual 
granddaughter). Yet his persona 
should not be mistaken. Ross 
stands poised in front of a 
window 
bearing 
the 
same 
orange and blue that pervades 
his namesake school. He looks 

presidential, all the way down 
to the small American flag 
cufflink exposed on his left 
wrist. And in fact, the image 
was done by American artist 
Everett 
Raymond 
Kinstler, 
the same man who did the 
official presidential portraits of 
Ronald Reagan and Michigan 
alum Gerald Ford. Rumor has 
it, if you stand in front of the 
painting and say Ross three 
times outloud, J.P. Morgan will 
contact you about a junior year 
internship within the hour.
Walking through Blau, the 
poetic younger sister of mighty 
Ross, your eyes will be directed 
towards 
frame 
after 
frame 
of abstract modern art. My 
personal favorite hangs from 
the left as you walk out of the 
building, 
a 
geometric 
little 
piece by American artist Sol 
LeWitt. The piece is entitled 
“Irregular, 
Angular 
Brush 
Strokes” 
and 
is 
composed 
of colorful — you guessed it 
— 
irregular, 
angular 
brush 
strokes. Much like a business 
education, this art is straight to 
the point. When I first looked 
at and subsequently tried to 
interpret this art, I thought the 
lines were an abstract take on 
stick figures, welding together 
people of all colors to speak 
towards inclusion and diversity. 
Apparently, the true meaning 
is highlighting the unexpected 
aspects of our mental process. 
Either way, they’re pretty cool 
lines.
As you leave the building, 
what do you feel? Do you 
feel 
enlightened? 
Inspired? 
Indifferent? Annoyed by this 
treatise? I could write 900 more 
words about the art in Ross. 
I want to know who chose it, 
where it came from, why they 
chose it, how much it cost. It’s 
like a friend’s annoying habit, 
once you notice it you can’t 
stop thinking about it. I’ve 
highlighted a few pieces of 
art, but there are still over 200 
for you to seek out yourself. If 
nothing else, I hope you feel 
encouraged 
to 
look 
around 
while you’re walking through 
life instead of straight forward. 
You may be surprised by what 
you see.

Discovering works of art 
over at the Business school

Spouses have been and still 
are designing together, and 
they’re doing it well.As early as 
the ’60s with the prominence 
of 
designers 
like 
Charles 
and Ray Eames, to today in 
the Chip and Joanna Gaines 
phenomena that was once the 
HGTV series “Fixer Upper” 
and has fabricated itself into 
a interior design collection at 
Target. Blending the romantic 
and 
creative, 
couples 
are 
redefining what it means to 
work in a team. Even high-end 
brands like Tory Burch are 
making things a family affair, 
Burch naming her husband 
Pierre-Yves Roussel the chief 
executive of her company.
Why, you might ask, would 
people mix home life with work 
life? Or even choose to share 
something you’ve made with 
someone else? Coming from an 
artist’s perspective, I am not 
sure I could so willingly share 
my creative endeavors. Yet, 
when looking at such power 
couples, 
something 
clearly 
seems to be working. Ray and 

Charles Eames revolutionized 
the worlds of mid-century 
modern 
furniture, 
graphic 
and architectural design. And 
Tory Burch is a timeless, high 
quality brand in the world of 
fashion. These couples have 
shaped design so much so that 
other spouses are following 
suit, inviting their significant 
others to design alongside 

them.
When 
looking 
at 
the 
relationships of these creative 
pairs, it begins to make sense 
that one would want to work 
so closely with their spouse. 
While 
it 
is 
an 
extremely 
personal process, design is 
one that relies on the people 
around you to challenge and 
better your ideas. Why not 
choose someone who will be 

brutally honest with you or 
will listen to random creative 
discoveries that pop into your 
head at three in the morning? 
Designing is a lifestyle, so 
why not blend the personal 
and professional? When you 
have constant conversations, 
brainstorms and sketching, 
the outcome is almost always 
better 
designs 
and 
new 
discoveries. When including 
a spouse in the process of 
design, 
brands 
inherently 
become more family-oriented 
in the eyes of the consumer, 
creating a sense of comfort. 
Knowing that not one, but 
two individuals are constantly 
revising, bettering, thinking 
about the product they are 
creating, 
customers 
feel 
connected 
to 
the 
product 
they 
are 
buying, 
knowing 
the investment is one of true 
value.
While 
on 
the 
surface, 
Burch’s decision to elect her 
husband 
as 
CEO 
narrows 
her field of work within the 
company, what she is doing 
is showing herself as a true 
professional, willing to do 
what is best for her work and 
the world of design as a whole.

The aesthetic of being a 
couple in the workplace

MARGARET SHERIDAN
Daily Style Editor

Unlike the students who 
were 
willing 
to 
test 
the 
waters with some brand of 
a biology major and organic 
chemistry, I learned really 
early on that pre-med wasn’t 
for me. Maybe it’s my lack 
of willpower for work of 
disinterest 
(i.e., 
anything 
my parents expected of me). 
Or, perhaps, my willingness 
to better exert myself into 
topics of my interest. I can’t 
truly put my finger on it. 
All I know was that there 
wasn’t enough space for me in 
physics, so I took an art class 
my sophomore year of high 
school and my life changed 
forever. While my grade in 
the class soared and I scored 
a place in the city-wide art 
show, my math exams were 
about as dismal as they had 
ever been in my entire life. 
My mother scorned me, but 
in retrospect, it strikes me a 
lot more as a tradeoff than as 
a failure; I’ve gone through 
a lot of charcoal over the 
years, but not very many math 
books.
And though I still do believe 
I embody this artistic spirit, 
I can’t help but think of my 
earlier perceptions of what 
it meant to be a disillusioned 
artist. At 16, I saw artists on 
a different plane from people 
who had more “pragmatic” 
goals for the future in mind. 
Who really needed to know 
anything beyond their purest 
craft when guided by passion? 
I thought that simply because 
I enjoyed portraiture (and, 
not gonna lie, I was pretty 
damn good at it), I would 
make it as an artist simply by 
merit of this fact and the idea 
that other people who were 
guided by fear of financial 
stability were sellouts. For 
people like a 16-year-old me, I 
have one thing to ask you: Are 
you miserable yet?
As heavy consumers of art, 
whether it be on Soundcloud 
or at the Detroit Institute of 
Arts, we’re quick to blame 
artists when it’s obvious their 
piece was produced for mass 
appeal. We challenge them to 
revert back to truer versions 
of themselves, to adopt a style 

that strikes us more genuine. 
But can you truly do this 
when you base your entire 
career off of art? Is it really 
that easy to brave your most 
personal work to the world 
without fear of rejection?
I say all of this because I 
wanted a career based off 
of art. I wanted all my life’s 
accomplishments 
latched 
onto a project that spoke to 
my personal experiences and 
those of others. And perhaps 
that might’ve come to fruition 
if I stuck at it. But when I 
graduated 
high 
school, 
it 
struck me that passion and 
talent alone wouldn’t get you 

anywhere; you had to be able 
to sell yourself and if there’s 
anything I can’t do, it’s that.
I 
opened 
myself 
up 
for 
commissioning 
and 
Instagramming my artwork a 
few months prior to starting 
college. 
My 
art 
teacher 
recommended me to some 
people in the city interested 
in portraits and then people 
on the internet would message 
me. I remember thinking, 
“This is my big break.” I 
just had to get my name 
recognized. I tried everything 
from submitting my work to 
art galleries to buying fancy 
frames to make my work look 

more professional. It was a 
lot of paper filling, a lot of 
time inside and alone in the 
summer. But it was worth it 
for what I loved, right?
I quickly learned that the 
thing with trying to get people 
to buy your art is that your 
vision doesn’t mean much to 
them. This isn’t to say your 
signature and work doesn’t 
matter — it does, and people 
will appreciate it regardless. 
The thing is, you lose a bit of 
what makes your art yours 
when 
your 
production 
is 
dependent on the approval of 
others. I remember looking 
back at my art at the end of 
that summer and despising 
everything I made; it struck 
me how different it all looked 
from pieces I had made in the 
past. It lacked the pops of 
color I liked integrating into 
my black and white pieces, the 
3-D textures I carved in for a 
signature style. There was no 
development as far as I could 
see; there’s just not much 
leeway when people request 
very specifically that you 
draw a photoreal portrait of 
their dog in black and white.
I don’t think these feelings 
apply 
for 
everyone. 
Some 
people master the art of 
business and the business 
of art. So go on, make your 
YouTube channel, post your 
photography on Instagram. 
I think the problem for me 
was 
that 
I 
couldn’t 
find 
balance between the two. I 
was always either way too 
fixated 
on 
promoting 
my 
art or not doing enough of 
it. Perhaps I could’ve done 
things differently as an artist 
— found projects I liked or 
stuck to a more authentic 
representation 
of 
my 
art 
before promoting it to others. 
All things considered, I don’t 
think I wasted my time with 
this experience. I learned that 
even though I love producing 
art, it requires a lot of alone 
time, something I’ll already 
apt at providing myself with 
as an introvert. And now, as 
I study to become a teacher, 
I find my artwork a lot less 
prolific, a lot more deliberate. 
I’m genuinely content with my 
portfolio slowly expanding 
in the top right corner of my 
dorm room, even if no one 
ever gets to see any of it.

In pursuit of a paycheck, 
or, how I learned to stop 
worrying and not get paid

“DE AQUÍ NO 
SALES”

Rosalía

Universal Music 
Group

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘DE AQUÍ NO 
SALES’

“DE 
AQUÍ 
NO 
SALES 
(Cap.4: Disputa)” stands out 
as one of the most antagonistic 
songs off of singer/songwriter 
Rosalía’s dynamic 2018 release 
El Mal Querer. “Yo que tanto 
te camelo / Y tú me la vienes 
haciendo” she howls at the 
space around her, and the 
words have only just been 
wrenched 
from 
her 
body 
before they are swallowed 
whole by the snarl of revving 
motorcycle engines. The song 
inspires the same kind of 
images that are reminiscent 
of Mad Max’s apocalyptic 
wasteland — as hostile and 
wretched as Fury Road itself.
The 
recently 
released 
music video for “DE AQUÍ 
NO SALES” does not stray 
far from these preexistent 
associations. It starts with 
Rosalía half-submerged in a 

pond, dressed as an incarnate 

of Björk’s Vulnicura cover 
and surrounded by twisted 
hunks of metal. From there, 
the 
images 
flash 
between 

shots of Rosalía dressed as the 
ultimate badass of any of “Fast 
and Furious” film, doused in 
flames and back again in water, 
yet each time we come back to 
this shot, she sinks lower and 
lower. By the time the song’s 
last spoken line “Caramelos 
también tengo” is uttered, her 
head is the only appendage we 
can see above the water; she is 
nearly consumed by the murky 
depths. Then, the tempo picks 
up, and a shot of a windmill 
exploding into flames takes us 
into the image of a trumphiant 
Rosalía rising from the fire. 
She 
boards 
a 
motorcycle 
and rides into the moonlight 
countryside. She doesn’t look 
back.

It 
should 
come 
as 
no 
surprise 
that 
American 
audiences utterly devour the 
televised talent competition: 
It’s one part sadistic guilty 
pleasure, one part inspiration 
porn and one part fantasy 
fulfillment 
of 
having 
the 
same deciding power as an 
L.A. talent executive. Yet, at 
its core, the televised talent 
competition is emblematic of 
the “American Dream” ideal 
we claim our society operates 
upon.
Just in case you didn’t 
read “The Great Gatsby” at 
some point in your schooling, 
the American Dream is the 
common 
mythology 
that 
each and every U.S. citizen 
has 
equal 
opportunity 
to 
attain the highest of their 
aspirations. All it takes is 
hard work (and apparently 
not 
the 
right 
ancestry, 
genitalia or religion)! This 
rose-tinted 
idealization 
of 
the mechanics of our society 
is integral to the formula of 
the talent competition. Just as 
the American Dream blindly 
posits that the next great 
entrepreneur could very well 
be from Section 8, the talent 
competition promises that the 
Next Big Thing™ will not be 
found as a result of nepotistic 
connections, 
but 
could 
be 
spotted among the crowd at 
one of the many cattle-call 

auditions across the United 
States.
And while moments of shock 
generated 
from 
a 
random 
North Dakotan who can walk 
and pose like Naomi Campbell 
or a backwoods woman who 
can sing like Céline Dion 
seem 
to 
bolster 
belief 
in 
the 
egalitarian 
utopia 
the 
American Dream advertises, 
the lack of success for the 
majority of the winners post-
show reveals the true nature 
of the American Dream that 
many of us are more familiar 
with: a scam, unabashedly 
orchestrated 
to 
fool 
the 
masses and serve only the 
elites at the top.
In 2019, it does not take 
a 
seasoned 
cultural 
critic 
to predict that the winners 
of these competition shows 
will be has-beens by the time 
the season finale concludes. 
This is not a new pattern. 
Originally 
running 
from 
1983 to 1995, “Star Search” 
ironically did more for the 
contestants who did not win 
than those that did. Through 
its vague promise of stardom 
for an unknown and its use of 
a panel of judges to deliberate 
the skills of contestants, it 
is clear that “Star Search” 
walked 
so 
that 
“American 
Idol” could fly. And fly it did. 
For those of us born between 
1996 and 2000, we were too 
young at the time of its 2002 
launch 
to 
recognize 
the 
magnitude of its popularity. 
The widespread acclaim was 
in no doubt related to the 

fresh (at the time) convention 
of allowing the audience, 
through SMS text, to have 
final say over who would 
ultimately become America’s 
newest sensation. Thus, it 
should come as no surprise 
that one of the show’s most 
(if not the most) recognizable 
winners, Kelly Clarkson, was 
crowned during the season in 
which the most people were 
glued to the screens watching 
her journey.
“American Idol” was so 
successful that it was only 
a 
matter 
of 
time 
before 
troves of imitators emerged, 
hoping to capitalize on the 
current trend of audience 
determinism. 
To 
name 
a 
few, there’s “America’s Got 
Talent,” “So You Think You 
Can 
Dance,” 
“America’s 
Next 
Top 
Model,” 
“Last 
Comic Standing,” “American 
Superstar,” “The Next: Fame 
Is At Your Doorstep,” and 
then a second wave led by 
“The 
Voice,” 
“The 
Four,” 
“The Face” and “The Rap 
Game.” Nevertheless, as the 
seasons of “Idol” and the 
others waxed on and their 
audiences 
diminished, 
it 
became evident that, despite 
the repetitive declarations of 
the “lucrative” prizes to be 
awarded to the victors, these 
shows were not even capable 
of producing a solid C-list 
celebrity, let alone the A-list 
icons they initially promised.
The people running the 
programs, 
those 
already 
entrenched in the business, 
have always retained the 
knowledge that it takes a 
bit more than a check and 
a competition prize (a six 
page spread in Seventeen 
magazine, a record deal with 
Sony, a contract with So So Def 
Records ... the list goes on) to 
conquer an entire industry. 
As the years progressed and 
more new shows continued 
to materialize, it has become 
clear that executives have 
exploited and are continuing 
to 
exploit 
the 
remaining 
audience’s 
belief 
in 
the 
American Dream, as well as 
our ignorance of how show 
business really works from 
the inside. After all, what 
experience does the average 
mechanic 
from 
Tennessee 
have in show business to 
know that a contract is not 
the surefire ticket out of 
obscurity?
Despite the promise of 
instant stardom, the talent 
contestants 
only 
have 
15 
fleeting minutes of fame to 
show for their participation 

while 
network 
executives 
continue to profit off of 
the lies they spin to both 
participants 
and 
loyal 

viewers. 
Don’t 
believe 
me? Consider the fact that 
Simon 
Cowell 
and 
Simon 
Fuller, executive producers 
on “American Idol” and “X 

Factor,” each maintain a net 
worth exceeding 500 million 
dollars, yet the only thing 
“Idol” season seven winner 
Taylor Hicks maintains is 
a spot on “Where Are They 
Now” lists. These executives 
treat the usually organic star-
making process as though 
it is mass production. And 
in recent years, as winners 
become 
more 
and 
more 
inconsequential, it appears 
as though they realized the 
futility in investing even 
the bare minimum of time 
and money in convincing the 
public to fall in love with 
a new “top” model, dancer, 
rapper or singer every year.
Thus, new strategies are 
undertaken to ensure that 
audiences are still engaged 
and, 
most 
importantly, 
profits remain high. This is 
evidenced in the shift away 
from 
contestant-centric 
content 
to 
content 
that 
overwhelmingly centers the 
already-established celebrity 
judges; or worse, a celebrity 
who 
creates 
a 
shameless 
vehicle 
for 
themselves. 
For “American Idol,” it is 
no 
coincidence 
that 
the 
high 
turnover 
of 
judges 
coincided almost precisely 
with mainstream audiences’ 
apathy 
toward 
whoever 
won the show. What’s more 
memorable in recent “Idol” 
canon: the Mariah Carey-
Nicki Minaj beef or the name 
of the season 13 winner? 
Another 
example 
of 
this 
phenomenon is exhibited in 
“The Voice,” where media 
coverage 
unmistakably 
touched 
moreso 
on 
the 
celebrity judges in the chairs 
and their relationships than 
the 
contestants. 
Even 
in 
cases of celebrity vehicles 
like Tyra Banks’ “America’s 
Next Top Model” or Jermaine 
Dupree’s “The Rap Game,” 
buzz is not generated from 
winners (in fact, I cannot 
think of a single mainstream 
sensation produced in either 
show’s 
history). 
Buzz 
is 
derived from the celebrity 
attempting to revamp their 
careers.
The 
contestants 
— 
the regular people — in 
their attempts to live out 
an 
idealized 
fantasy 
of 
transcending 
whichever 
barriers stand in their way 
of wealth and fame quite 
ironically end up becoming 
instruments 
perpetuating 
the system they tried so hard 
to confront.
So much for the American 
Dream.

According to Lillian Li, 
University of Michigan MFA 
and author of “Number One 
Chinese Restaurant” (2018), 
the 
success 
of 
Chinese 
restaurants in America is 
the best-kept secret in the 
business. Following the Gold 
Rush and the completion 
of 
the 
Transcontinental 
Railroad, 
Chinese 
immigrants were blacklisted 
from 
most 
industries 
by 
white workers who feared 
they would drive wages down 
and were confined to the 
“women’s work” 
of 
laundry 
and 
cooking. 
Many 
of 
the 
original owners 
of 
Chinese 
restaurants had 
no 
culinary 
training 
and 
could 
only 
estimate 
the 
flavors of their 
homeland, 
making 
them 
sweeter, saltier 
and 
tangier 
when 
they 
realized 
that 
American 
palates 
preferred 
bold 
flavors. In an interview with 
The Daily, Li pointed out that 
“Now there are more Chinese 
restaurants in America than 
McDonalds. It’s actually one 
of the most inspiring stories 
of entrepreneurial underdog-
ship, and it’s crazy that most 
people don’t know it. America 
loves the underdog, but they 
don’t like the underdog when 
it has a foreign face.”
“Number 
One 
Chinese 
Restaurant” 
is 
a 
dark 
family epic in the tradition 
of 
two 
other 
University 
MFAs, Celeste Ng (“Little 
Fires 
Everywhere” 
and 
“Everything I Never Told 
You”) 
and 
Jesmyn 
Ward 
(“Sing, 
Unburied, 
Sing” 
and “Salvage the Bones”). 
The 
novel 
follows 
three 
generations of the highly-
dysfunctional 
Han 
family 
and 
their 
employees 
at 
the Beijing Duck House, a 
thriving Chinese restaurant 
in the D.C. metro area, as 
they attempt to reconcile 
their 
competing 
visions 
of 
business 
success 
with 
their 
tangled 
personal 
relationships. 
When 
a 
mysterious fire razes the 
Duck House, this ensemble 
cast of characters is forced 
to 
confront 
the 
tensions 
that have simmered beneath 
the surface for years, and 
to choose where their first 
loyalties lie: to family, to 
ambition, to integrity or to 
survival.
The novel is loosely based 
on 
Li’s 
own 
experience 
working 
in 
a 
Chinese 
restaurant, a job so strenuous 
that she left after only four 

weeks. Li said, “It gave me 
a look into the emotional 
difficulties of a service job, 
particularly a service job 
where 
you’re 
working 
in 
a Chinese restaurant and 
have a Chinese face. There’s 
an extra level of alienation 
and 
dehumanization 
that 
happens with the customers 
to the servers. It made me 
wonder what it would have 
been like if I had been in that 
space for longer than four 
weeks, if I hadn’t had the 
opportunity to leave.” This 
notion of being trapped — by 
a toxic work environment, 
by 
family 
obligation 
and 
by 
the 
characters’ 
own 
insurmountable 
flaws 
— 
resonates 
throughout 
the 
novel 
in 
a 
way 
that 
steadfastly 
resists 
sentimentality 
or idealization. 
Li’s worldview 
flirts 
with 
pessimism but 
never 
steps 
fully over that 
line, 
landing 
instead 
on 
a 
sometimes 
grim, 
often 
funny 
and 
always sharply 
observed realism. She said, 
“I think it’s a worldview that 
is interested in the darker 
side of human connection 
and 
intimacy, 
but 
also 
understands that you have 
to have some moments of joy 
and grace, even within that 
darkness.”
In 
Li’s 
novel, 
these 
“moments of grace” tend to be 
rooted in love, vulnerability 
and 
self-sacrifice, 
while 
darkness 
manifests 
in 
the desire for 
wealth, prestige 
and 
power, 
embodied most 
clearly in the 
nefarious, 
Godfather-
esque figure of 
Uncle Pang. In 
a twist on the 
Faust 
legend, 
Jimmy 
Han, 
owner 
of 
the 
Duck 
House, 
must 
decide 
between selling 
his soul to Pang 
in 
exchange 
for 
fulfilled 
ambition 
and 
freeing 
his 
family at last 
from the mobster’s clutches. 
For Li, this kind of moral 
arithmetic is typical of the 
way business and ambition 
require people to rearrange 
their 
value 
systems. 
She 
is 
suspicious 
of 
highly 
profitable 
businesses 
in 
general, 
and 
her 
novel 
functions as a twist on the 
American Dream narrative, a 
national myth that positions 
economic 
success 
as 
the 

key to true belonging and 
respect. Li said, “I think 
the American Dream is an 
incomplete narrative. It’s all 
about grand success for your 
life, that you can end with 
much more than you started 
with. And I think that that 
can only happen if there is 
some kind of original sin. If 
you trace any success story 
far enough back you will 
see a real crime. Success 
basically 
means 
that 
you 
have more resources than 
your neighbor, so how did 
you 
get 
those 
resources? 
And how did you get so many 
more resources than your 
neighbor did? But those little 
crimes are very normalized 
in our society.”
Li’s 
work 
also 
speaks 
eloquently to the ways these 
calculations 
of 
success 
change across generations. 
For the first generation of 
Duck House owners, success 
can be measured in purely 
economic terms, while their 
sons realize that no amount 
of money can buy them the 
respect and prestige that 
they truly desire. Li said, “I 
was trying to speak to this 
idea that for most groups 
of people, no matter how 
much money you have, you 
still can’t buy your way into 
influence. 
Because 
money 
has entered the bloodstream 
of our society so much, it 
seems to be the only way to 
get the universal things that 
people want: to be desired, to 
be attractive, to be respected, 
to have dignity. What this 
book says is that money can’t 
buy everything, but there is a 
reason why we think it can.”
Li’s distrust of profit as 
the 
primary 
measure 
of 
success expands into her 
own experience 
with 
the 
publishing 
industry, as an 
author and as 
a 
bookseller 
at 
the 
cult-
favorite 
bookstore 
Literati. Li has 
no 
desire 
to 
make 
writing 
her main source 
of income, and 
her respect for 
the publishing 
industry comes 
precisely from 
the things that 
decrease 
its 
profitability. 
Li said, “What 
I 
love 
about 
the publishing 
industry is that they are 
uniquely bad at business. 
Bookstores can return any 
books they don’t sell. There’s 
no 
formula. 
Nobody 
can 
predict what book is going 
to sell well. It kind of defies 
a lot of attempts to make it a 
really profitable, smoothly-
running business machine. 
You can be bad at business 
and still be successful, and 
that’s really heartening!”
ALEC COHEN / MICHIGAN DAILY

ALICE LIU / MICHIGAN DAILY
Lillian Li on publishing 
and her role in business

English, Business & arts

“My job is all about how do we get 
people to move,” Marcus Collins, 
the chief consumer connections 
officer at the advertising agency 
Doner Company, said. “That is, how 
do we leverage what we know of the 
behavioral sciences, the evolving 
media landscape and a close 
proximity to culture in an effort to 
get people to adopt behavior.”
In addition to working for 
Doner, Collins is an intermittent 
marketing lecturer at the Ross 
School of Business. Collins started 
as a musician before entering the 
business world and has collaborated 
on 
marketing 
with 
dominant 
cultural forces like Beyoncé and 
iTunes. This unique background 
gives him critical insight into the 
crossover between business and the 
arts, and how to go about knocking 
down the partition that consistently 
separates the two.
In 
a 
sit-down 
conversation 
with Collins, we touched on 
the polarization of the arts and 
business, specifically within higher 
education: 
“There’s 
a 
certain 
pragmatism to business, I mean 
the business school, it’s a practice 
school.” Collins elaborated on the 
natural inclination to discount the 
arts due to its theoretical nature, 
with a recurring theme of “art for 
the sake of the body of knowledge 
that we amass.” However, Collins 
shifted to note how critical it is for the 
arts and business to collide. “When 
we look at art as a manifestation of 
culture, it’s completely different,” 
he said. Collins referenced Emile 
Durkheim, a father of sociology, 
when he defined culture as “the 
system by which beliefs, values, 
communication and artifacts are 
adopted by a populace of people.” 
He noted that “when the culture 
moves, we move in concert. That is, 
the people who align to the culture, 
they act in solidarity with the group 
of people.” In simple terms, it moves 
as so: Who do businesses want to 
influence? People. What influences 
people? Culture. And the arts, well, 
they play a ridiculously large part in 
culture.
For 
English 
and 
Business 
students, 
like 
myself, 
who 
consistently feel like oil and water, 
Collins established a clear mix of 
the two. When we view art as a 
manifestation of culture which 
dictates human behavior, it becomes 
extremely practical and business-
like to be in close proximity to 
the arts. Collins highlighted this 
relationship when he discussed how 
culture, and consequently the arts, 
is used to develop strong marketing 
tactics. He described art as “a lever 
that you pull from a pragmatic 
perspective of going to market, of 
being a business person.” Collins 
reiterates art as quintessential to 
human behavior: “What we feel 
drives what we do. Art is evocative 
that way, it stimulates particular 
emotions, 
which 
stimulate 
particular behavioral outcomes.” 
In this way, business cannot be 
without the arts. How humans 
exchange and transact with one 
another is so closely related to not 
just culture, but to how we feel, 
which largely comes from artistic 
influences.
Collins masterfully put this into 
perspective, using my own writing 
as an example to draw from. “We 
discount art on a theoretical level, 
we say, ‘this is subjective or this 
has nothing to do with commerce.’ 
Like you writing an essay, what does 
that have to do with commerce? 
But when your essay becomes the 
manifesto for a populace of people 

and their culture, now you as an 
author of said prose, are really 
powerful.” 
Collins 
emphasized 
that “culture is the vehicle by 
which 
art 
becomes 
tangible.” 
This operationalization of art is 
wildly powerful for businesses. Art 
allows them to connect with their 
consumers and develop the genuine 
relationships necessary for the 
success of a firm.
This, however, suggests the other 
inevitable link between business 
and the arts: authenticity. The 
seemingly inevitable event of a “sell-
out” is something that all creators 
fear. Collins explained how artists 
and businesses alike must maintain 
their 
convictions 
to 
capture 
human admiration, matching their 
behaviors to their belief systems. 
“Authenticity comes from one’s 
ability, one’s grit, to maintain their 
convictions,” Collins said. “Living 
up to your convictions is a cool 
thing. And when a brand does that, 
it gets adopted by people who see 
the world similarly.”
Collins provided clarity with 
examples, detailing how Pabst Blue 
Ribbon saw dramatic increases in 
sales when their belief system of 
self-expression and egalitarianism 
matched 
with 
“hipsters” 
who 
believe in the same values that 
PBR does. Collins illuminated the 
idea that businesses and artists 
approach authenticity in similar 
manners: “This is my belief system 
and the populace of people who 
believe what I believe connect to it.” 
Collins referenced “the old Kanye” 
as a prime example of having a 
belief system and finding a dense 
community that readily connects 
with it.
The crossovers between business 
and the arts are clear, and Collins’s 
career speaks tribute to that. On 
an everyday basis, however, how 
does one interact with academic 
entities that are so often placed on 
opposite ends of the spectrum? 
After attentively listening to my 
trials and tribulations as a Business 
and English student, he provided 
immense hope, delving into the 
means of operating with agency in 
the “business-arts” space.
When asked what combines 
the arts and business together, 
Collins responded immediately. 
“Humanity,” he said. “You have to 
see the humanity in the business 
like you see the humanity in the arts. 
The idea of transaction is personal. 
Business is about exchanges. We 
try to humanize things to make 
meaning out of it.”
Business and the arts share 
connection and empathy, even 
when humanization seems miles 
away from the likes of business. “If 
you don’t understand people, you 
don’t understand business,” Collins 
said. “Business is all about people. 
Everything we do in business is 
about getting people to take on a 
behavior.”
Collins constantly reminds his 
students that marketing is about so 
much more than just selling things. 
“Marketing is going to market,” 
he said. “Well, what is the market? 
People.” Lucky for me, and lucky for 
Daily Arts, the arts spur emotion 
and behavior like none other and 
therefore have a powerful capability 
to 
alter 
the 
market. 
Collins 
summarized what students in the 
space of business-arts should hold 
steadfast in: “How do you leverage 
the arts (visual, written, audio) and 
use those as vehicles by which we 
interact with humanity?”
To Business and art students 
striving keep their energy flowing, 
this ode from Collins may spark 
your zest. “Your foot in each world 
is what makes you so powerful,” he 
said. Collins elaborated that artists 

do not only know the culture, they 
drive the culture and at the end 
of the day, businesses latch onto 
culture manifested by the arts. 
“Brands who lead culture are more 
successful than brands who follow 
... it’s more so about, ‘how do I 
make these things come together 
by leveraging the power of the arts 
to solve problems creatively?’ And 
then look at the world of art and 
find, ‘how do I operationalize this 
from a transactional perspective?’” 
he said.
As a student who started 
out business-focused and now 
desperately clings to the arts, I 
decided to seek out the inverse 
perspective. For students who 
start 
with 
arts 
and 
follow 
with 
entrepreneurship 
and 
marketability, how do they move 
towards the avenue of considering 
their art from a transactional 
perspective? Daily Arts reached out 
to Jonathan Kuuskoski, assistant 
professor of music in the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance and chair of 
the department of entrepreneurship 
& leadership. Kuuskoski made it 
glaringly apparent that students 
with the inverse of my academic 
path converge into a similar space 
of mixing the arts with business 
and that the resources to do so are 
abundant. Kuuskoski works to help 
students in the performing arts 
live a sustainable life, and provides 
them the correct resources to do so. 
Kuukoski’s department provides 
over 20 courses in topics such as arts 
management, arts marketing and 
financial management, in addition 
to providing immersions, coaching 
and funding for internships and 
ventures.
Kuuskoski noted a commonality 
in students who want to make 
their art at all costs, but need help 
selling it. He guides students in 
navigating this process, particularly 
in reaching for collaborations and 
partnerships and in establishing 
their personal strategy. His advice 
included finding a vision. “How 
would the world look in 10 years if 
you achieved your goal?,” he said. 
“What’s the vision for your work, 
that goes beyond the generic ‘make 
great art?’”
Just as Marcus Collins spoke 
of 
authenticity, 
Kuuskoski 
emphasized the importance of 
holding true to one’s convictions. 
“Start by reflecting back on your 
core values, so you can articulate 
what is distinctive about the ways 
in which your artistic output will 
set you apart,” he said. Moreover, 
Kuuskoski touches on humanity as 
a means to traverse business and 
the arts, just as Collins reiterated 
that “business is all about people.” 
Kuuskoski relays to his students 
that “every successful artist has a 
circle of collaborators, of people 
who were meaningful to them. 
These people could be potential 
investors and supporters.”
In 
reflecting 
upon 
my 
conversations with both Collins and 
Kuuskoski, it became extremely 
apparent that businesses aim to 
infiltrate our culture and ways 
of behaving, and that these ways 
of behaving often spur from art, 
even if companies aren’t aware of 
it. As Collins said, “Being close to 
the culture means understanding 
the artistic artifacts that come 
out 
of 
the 
culture. 
Having 
proximity to the arts allows you to 
operationalize that in a business 
realm.” Consistent closeness to art 
is not only a passion of mine, but 
it’s also extremely powerful when 
used in a continuous manner with 
business. I aim to harness the power 
of this concurrence, and Collins and 
Kuuskoski gave me the assurance 
and moral to do so.

more Chinese 
restaurants in 
America than 
McDonalds
