Findings prompt 
administration to 
review prevention, 
awareness policies

By EMMA KERR

Summer Editor in Chief

University President Mark 

Schlissel spoke at a conference 
today following the release of 
survey results from the Uni-
versity’s Campus Climate Sur-
vey on Sexual Misconduct that 
Schlissel said sought to conduct 
a “thorough, transparent and 
honest 
self-examination” 
of 

sexual misconduct on campus.

Accompanying Schlissel at 

the conference were William 
Axinn, a professor at the Insti-
tute for Social Research, and 
Holly Rider-Milkovich, direc-
tor of the Sexual Assault Pre-
vention and Awareness Center.

The survey, which Schlissel 

announced on January 12, was 
distributed to 3,000 randomly 
selected students starting at the 
beginning of April.

In response to the survey’s 

results, Schlissel said the Uni-
versity is taking immediate 
action by increasing the num-
ber of staff members involved 
in handling sexual misconduct 
on campus in addition to mov-
ing forward with a review of 
the current Sexual Misconduct 
Policy.

“We are adding staff to help 

us develop and deliver the best 
possible prevention and educa-
tion programs, to speed up sex-
ual misconduct investigations 
and to help counsel and support 
survivors,” Schlissel said.

While the timeliness of the 

University’s process in han-
dling sexual misconduct cases 
has been a criticism in the past, 
Schlissel said due to the com-
plex nature of sexual miscon-
duct cases, the University is 
seeking to “make sure that our 
process is both fair and thor-
ough.”

In 
2013, 
the 
University 

received national attention fol-
lowing the University’s decision 
to permanently separate from 
Brendan Gibbons, the Michigan 
football team’s starting kicker, 

four years after allegedly violat-
ing the Student Sexual Miscon-
duct Policy.

Highlighting survey results 

relating to number of reported 
instances of sexual misconduct, 
Schlissel said only a “small frac-
tion” of sexual misconduct inci-
dents are reported — an issue 
Schlissel said needs to be fur-
ther addressed by the Univer-
sity. Rider-Milkovich cited the 
need to adjust current meth-
ods of educating students on 
sexual misconduct, saying work 
needs to be done to ensure stu-
dents feel safe and comfortable 
reporting instances of sexual 
misconduct.

“This data is critically impor-

tant to our work on this campus 
because it provides institu-
tion specific information for 
the first time that we will use 
to shape additional preven-
tion efforts going forward as 
well as identifying increased 
efforts educating our students 
on our policies, our resources, 
and to strengthen and refine 
our already existing signifi-
cant educational efforts, which

City Council 

approves closure of 
Fourth Avenue after 
decision is released

By ALYSSA BRANDON and

Summer Managing News Editors 

As the release of the Supreme 

Court’s decision on several con-
solidated same-sex marriage cases 
draws near, preparations for the 
decision that may legalize same-
sex marriage in all 50 states are in 
full swing in the Ann Arbor com-
munity.

The 
Supreme 
Court 
began 

hearing oral arguments for sev-
eral consolidated cases challenging 
same-sex marriage bans in four dif-
ferent states under the case titled 
Obergefell v. Hodges in April.

One case the courts are con-

sidering includes DeBoer vs. Sny-
der, challenges Michigan’s ban on 
same-sex marriage. In January 
2012, Michigan residents April 
DeBoer and Jayne Rowse filed a 
lawsuit in the U.S. District Court, 
challenging Michigan’s ban on 
adoption by same-sex couples.

DeBoer and Rowse separately 

adopted one son and two daugh-
ters, respectively, but were unable 
to jointly adopt their children 
because Michigan law does not 
recognize same-sex marriages, and 
only grants joint parent adoption 
rights to married couples.

The Court’s decision in DeBoer 

vs Snyder, and the all other con-
solidated cases, in part will deter-
mine if the Court considers the 
14th amendment to require states 
to recognize marriages between 
same-sex couples.

The decision is expected in the

M Farmers Market 
 

provides students 
produce on campus 

Program emphasizes 

sustainability 

education through 
partnership with 

local farms

By ALAINA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

What’s green, looks like let-

tuce, and now appears at the 
Michigan Union, U-go’s, Wol-
verine Towers and other loca-
tions each once a week? The 
University’s new M Farmers 
Markets fresh produce. From 
strawberries to kale to celery, 
in-season vegetables and fruit 
will be available from M Farm-
ers Market at various campus 
locations.

M Farmers Markets is the 

result 
joint 
collaboration 

between MHealthy, CSG, the 
University’s 
Sustainability 

Initiative and Michigan Din-
ing. 
Community 
Supported 

Agriculture, a new program 
in which faculty and staff can 
buy shares from local farms 
and pick up ready-made boxes 
of produce once a week, will 
begin working with these var-
ious groups toward creating a 
wider variety and increased 
number of available fruits and 
vegetables.

According to the M Farm-

ers Market’s schedule, fruit 
and vegetable deliveries are 
between 11a.m. to 1p.m. on 
Mondays 
at 
the 
Michigan 

Union, Thursdays at the Uni-
versity Hospital Courtyard, 
and Fridays at Pierpont Com-
mons. The market also delivers 
on select Tuesdays at Wolver-
ine Tower and at the North 
Campus Research Complex.

Michigan Dining contacted 

Zilke Vegetable Farm in 2011, 
one of the farms partnering 

with the University to bring 
more vegetables and fruits to 
campus, with hopes that the 
farm could receive the neces-
sary certification in order to 
sell their produce on campus.

Vicky Zilke, one of the own-

ers of the vegetable farm, said 
the farm works hard to pro-
vide a variety of crops for the 
market.

“We are able to grow virtu-

ally everything — or, at least, 
a large number of products. So 
my husband and I grow a wide 
variety of crops that grow 
in Michigan. So I will bring 
what’s in season,” said Vicky 
Zilke.

Keith Soster, director of 

Student 
Engagement 
for 

Michigan Dining, said educa-
tion about sustainability is a 
large aspect of the M Farmers 
Markets.

Soster also said when the 

program was introduced in 
2011, 
assessments 
revealed 

students liked the idea, but 
wanted a greater variety of 
options and for the produce to 
be available more often.

“Students over the last cou-

ple of years have talked about 
food insecurity or food deserts 
around our area, so it made it 
more important to have pro-
duce available and affordable,” 
Soster said.

Christine Rogers, a rising 

sophomore studying Biopsy-
chology and Cognitive Neuro-
science (BCN), is a Michigan 
dining ambassador for Fire-
side Café at Pierpont Com-
mons and works behind the 
U-go’s Zilke M Farmers Mar-
ket produce stand.

Rogers said one of her 

responsibilities while working 
the stand is educating visitors 
about sustainability.

coming weeks before the end of

day morning.

Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council 

approved the closure of Fourth 
Avenue from Catherine to Kings-
ley on the day the court’s decision 
is released, per a request from the 
Jim Toy Community Center, an 
Ann Arbor based gay rights advo-
cacy group. The street will remain 
closed from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. during 
which supporters are expected to 
rally along with plaintiffs DeBoer 
and Rowse.

Hopeful that the Supreme 

Court will decide in favor of 
same-sex marriage, Councilmem-
ber Julie Grand (D-Ward 3) said 
a decision against couples repre-
sented in the cases could result 
in the loss of valued Ann Arbor 
residents. In an interview with 
the Daily, Grand expressed her 
support of closing roads in antici-
pation of the Ann Arbor and larger 
Michigan response to the deci-
sion’s release.

“It puts our state, and by exten-

sion Ann Arbor, at a disadvantage 
if we don’t have marriage equal-
ity,” Grand said. “I believe we have 
been losing really valuable resi-
dents who are making important 

contributions to our community...
because of this issue. For moral 
and ethical reasons, of course, 
I want to see us have marriage 
equality. I believe it’s the right 
thing to do.”

In addition to reactions that 

may occur on the closed streets 
downtown, 
attorneys 
repre-

senting DeBoer and Rowse will 
appear in Braun Court to answer 
questions 
and 
offer 
remarks 

on the court’s decision at noon. 
DeBoer and Rowse will also offer 
remarks outside Braun Court, 
where supporters are expected to 

our incoming students,” Rider-

Milkovich said.

Survey results show that 51 

percent of female undergraduates 
and 39.2 percent of male under-
graduates have attended or par-
ticipated in Relationship Remix, 
a University program created 
for first-year students that seeks 
to educate students on relation-
ships, sex and decision-making.

Data from the survey revealed 

that 42 percent of respondents 
were “very likely” to report inci-
dents of sexual assault to the 
University’s Sexual Assault Pre-
vention and Awareness Center.

Another 
initiative 
Rider-

Milkovich said is new to the 
University is the expansion of 
educational and prevention pro-
grams for graduate and profes-
sional students.

Schlissel said the level of the 

survey’s detail should help the 
University determine what meth-
ods of prevention and support 
are working, and gaining a more 
clear understanding of to which 
avenues students feel most com-
fortable reporting cases of sexual 
assault.

Though some students found 

the survey to be emotionally trig-
gering, Schlissel said the detailed 
nature of these questions meant 
the survey was very explicit but 
thorough.

The survey asked students to 

identify themselves in differ-
ent demographics, an aspect of 
this survey that Schlissel said is 
unique to the University. Accord-
ing to the survey, females are 7.7 

times more likely to experience 
non-consensual oral, vaginal or 
anal sex than males. Sorority and 
fraternity members are 2.5 times 
more likely to experience non-
consensual oral, vaginal or anal 
sex than average students.

Axinn said verbal pressure was 

another particularly important 
new finding discovered through 
the survey.

Eight percent of female under-

graduates answered yes when 
asked if verbal pressuring was 
involved in their experiences of 
non consensual oral, vaginal, or 
anal sex — a finding Schlissel and 
Axinn cited as significant and 
new. The issue of verbal coer-
cion, in addition to criticism of 
the timeliness of the University’s 
handling of sexual misconduct 
cases, was key in one student’s 
experience with sexual assault, 
as detailed in an investigation 
conducted by The Michigan Daily 
in April.

Finally, the survey found that 

among undergraduate students 
who did experience some form 
of sexual misconduct, 41.2 per-
cent of sexual misconduct cases 
occurred off-campus.

“This was a baseline survey,” 

Schlissel said. “We intend to dis-
cuss the findings more broadly in 
the fall with our student, faculty 
and staff.”be a time of significant 
change in higher education,” she 
said. “After much consideration 
and consultation with my closest 
advisers, friends, and family, I have 
decided that I want to turn the 
focus of my professional service to 
the broader problems and opportu-
nities facing universities.”

Study finds discrepancy in graduation rates

Research highlights 
gap among students 

of different 
backgrounds 

By ALAINA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

A recent study conducted by 

University Prof. Susan Dynar-
ski, a public policy, education 
and economics professor, high-
lights a discrepancy in college 
graduation rates among stu-
dents who come from different 
socioeconomic backgrounds.

According 
to 
Dynarski’s 

article discussing her research, 
which was featured the New 
York Times, the study found 
that across the country, 14 per-
cent of the poorest students 
sampled in 2002 had gone to col-
lege and graduated, whereas 60 
percent of the richest had gone 
to college and graduated.

Both 
students’ 
socioeco-

nomic and educational back-
grounds — for instance, if a 
student’s parents had gone to 
college — placed them in cat-
egories labeled as ‘advantaged’ 
and ‘disadvantaged.’ The study 
found that the graduation gap 
between the advantaged and the 

disadvantaged is larger than the 
enrollment gap. The advantaged 
are more likely not only to go to 
college and but to graduate as 
well.

“Put bluntly, class trumps 

ability when it comes to college 
graduation,” Dynarski wrote.

She argued differences in test 

scores and academic abilities 
between socioeconomic classes 
do not explain everything about 
the difference in who graduates. 
Ability by itself is not the only 
factor that effects graduation 
rates — it plays a smaller role in 
the graduation rate difference 
between rich and poor, accord-
ing to the article.

“Here’s 
another 
startling 

comparison: A poor teenager 
with top scores and a rich teen-
ager with mediocre scores are 
equally likely to graduate with 
a bachelor’s degree. In both 
groups, 41 percent receive a 
degree by their late 20s,” she 
wrote.

Dynarski drew much evi-

dence for her analysis from the 
Educational Longitude Study. 
Conducted in 2002, the study 
followed a sample of high school 
sophomores across the U.S. as 
they progressed through high 
school and college.

The national graduation aver-

age in 2012 was 59 percent, 

according to the National Cen-
ter for Educational Statistics. At 
the University, it was 90 percent 
in 2012.

According to the University’s 

admissions website, the Univer-
sity is a less expensive option for 
in-state students. For in-state 
students, the University meets 
100 
percent 
financial 
need, 

which is measured by subtract-
ing a student’s expected family 
contribution from the Univer-
sity’s cost of attendance. It is 
cheaper to attend the Univer-
sity as an in-state student and 
receive 
substantial 
financial 

aid than to attend a college that

OPINION

W

ith summer well under-
way, pool parties, sandy 
beaches and sunny skies 

appear splashed all 
over social media. 
Three weeks ago, 
my friend confessed 
to me that after 
changing her pro-
file picture, she was 
constantly checking Facebook to see 
how many “likes” it received.

Then last weekend, I was spending 

time with two friends who had both 
posted photos on Instagram. One of 
my friends turned to the other, after 
being disappointed by the low number 
of “likes” her post acquired and said it 
was probably because she had posted 
it at a bad time of day.

I don’t only hear these kinds of 

concerns amongst my friends, but 
I hear them as I sit in lecture halls 
and from strangers chatting next 
to me on the train or in the airport. 
Best-selling author and social media 
strategist, Julie Spira, calls a recent 
trend of social media induced anxi-
ety, Social Media Anxiety Disorder, 
which includes worrying about the 
“likes” on photos on Facebook, Insta-
gram or otherwise. Although it’s not 
part of the most recent Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders, SMAD describes a very real 
and current response to one of the 
challenges we face in the digital age.

There are many things I really enjoy 

about social media outlets, such as Ins-
tagram and Facebook. On Instagram, 
I enjoyed the pictures of cute baby 
animals, delicious food, monuments, 
nature hikes and important moments 
in people’s lives. On Facebook, I always 
laugh when I see the silly photos friends 
post of each other for their birthdays, 
and there are some great articles and 

videos about current events circulat-
ing on the site. I like being able to keep 
up with friends that are far away — as 
a student attending college out of state, 
social media can be a great way to stay 
connected. But what worries me about 
these social media sites is that they 
produce a situation in which users 
are constantly checking Facebook for 
“likes” on their recently updated pro-
file picture or how many followers they 
have on Instagram. Should “likes” on 
posts really become the focal point of 
Facebook and Instagram? It seems to 
me that more and more, social media is 
making it harder for individuals to be 
satisfied with self-validation.

I’m not criticizing social media 

users who keep checking back for likes 
on their photos, because that’s some-
thing many people do. That behavior 
is the result of the format of the web-
site, and these designs play on our 
human desire for social acceptance. 
However, it is important to highlight 
that using social media outlets can be 
more stressful than enjoyable at times. 
When usage of these sites becomes 
stressful, it’s a good idea to reevaluate 
the time and energy spent on captur-
ing that perfect sunset or the profile 
picture without a hair out of place, 
because one day you may realize you 
aren’t doing it for yourself.

People always ask me why I don’t 

have an Instagram. For a while, I 
did. I posted, checked for “likes” and 
followers and noticed when people 
unfollowed me. After a while, I real-
ized I was no longer really having fun. 
When I first got Instagram, I thought 
it would be a cool way to share 
moments in my life with friends and 
family. It didn’t cross my mind at 
the time that it could also leave me 
feeling like “likes” were validation. 
I realized after some time on Insta-

Currently, 
legislation 
in 

Michigan 
permits 
employ-

ers to provide young workers 
under 18 with an income that 
is 85 percent of either the state 
or federal minimum wage, 
depending upon which wage 
is the greater of the two. These 
young workers can be paid an 
hourly wage of roughly $7.25 
instead of the statewide hour-
ly wage of $8.15. The proposed 
Senate Bill 250 intends to 
extend this practice to individ-
uals 20 years old or younger. 
However, the intent of the bill 
operates under the assump-
tion that a majority of the 
workers in the targeted demo-
graphic are merely students or 
kids seeking a supplementary 
source of income and have 
access to other forms of finan-
cial means. Additionally, while 
a lower wage is logical for 
inexperienced workers who 
may just be entering the work-
force, those 18 or older have 
reached legal adulthood and 
often possess financial obliga-
tions that require them to be 
paid as such. A sizable portion 

of this particular age demo-
graphic — rather than attend-
ing college — may immediately 
enter the workforce full-time 
after high school and an initial 
minimum wage job may act 
as their sole source of income 
to cover all of their expenses. 
For students, this income may 
be heavily depended upon to 
pay tuition or for other related 
 

living expenses.

This legislation would be 

particularly disastrous con-
sidering recent rises in tuition 
rates across the state; the 
University Board of Regents 
recently approved a 2.7 per-
cent tuition increase. MSU 
and EMU will also raise their 
tuition by 2.7 percent and 
7.8 percent respectively. In 
the midst of college tuition 
increases, students from lower 
socioeconomic 
backgrounds 

who must work to pay increas-
ingly high tuition rates simply 
cannot afford to be paid less 
than minimum wage. In fact, 
the emergence of this legisla-
tion only threatens to further 
increase the overwhelming 

financial burdens individuals 
in this age demographic face.

One beneficial aspect of the 

bill is its intent to increase the 
“training wage” workers can 
be paid as they gain knowl-
edge of their newly obtained 
position within their first 90 
days of employment. The pro-
posed increases would raise 
this introductory wage from 
$4.25 to $6.25 an hour. This, 
however, in no way excus-
es the general objective of 
 

the legislation.

It’s likely that the legislation 

was created under the miscon-
ception that all adults who are 
18-20 years of age are still reli-
ant on parental support. How-
ever, this is far from the reality 
for many young adults. This 
legislation is not only unnec-
essary, but unjust. Why should 
they not earn a living wage 
simply due to their young 
age? There is absolutely no 
legitimate reason to deny one 
group of adults in Michigan 
the right to a living wage that 
all other adults in Michigan 
 

are guaranteed.

FROM THE DAILY

Waging a war on youth pay
 Proposed legislation seeks to lower wages for young adults
P

rospective legislation under the consideration of the Michi-
gan Senate intends to decrease the minimum wage for work-
ers under the age of 20. If approved and eventually signed 

into law, Senate Bill 250 would permit employers to pay any employ-
ee under the age of 20 a reduced wage that’s typically reserved only 
for workers under the age of 18. While the proposed legislation may 
offer some economic incentives for employers and businesses, the 
bill is highly presumptuous in nature, and if enacted, it would deny 
a livable wage to a population of young adults who may be relying 
on a minimum wage income for more than just spending money.

L

ate last Saturday morn-
ing, I went to a garage 
sale with my best friend/

sister-in-
law, Caitlin. 
(We 
were 

best friends 
before 
she 

fell in love 
with, 
mar-

ried and had 
a baby with 
my 
year-

younger 
brother). 
They 
were 

renovating and trying to move 
into our childhood home.

Caitlin was interested in a 

black, older but good condition 
table/shelf combo. After seeing 
it first, then walking around 
the small, unappealing garage 
sale, we returned to the furni-
ture set, and she bought it for 
$10. A plastic, 1986 Bud Light 
mug with a bull terrier mascot 
was added to the purchase for 
my brother because it was kind 
 

of comical.

The older man hosting the 

garage sale was insistent on 
helping load the furniture into 
the back of Caitlin’s seven-pas-
senger Yukon. He was taking 
a break from strategizing on 
how to fit both pieces when he 
noticed my tattoos half covered 
by my t-shirt sleeve.

Reaching his hand toward 

the top of my arm, the man 
acted as if he was going to 
lift my shirtsleeve up. He 
motioned for me to show him 
the rest of my tattoos, without 
a word about whether or not I 
 

appreciated his curiosity.

A globe, four-inches in diam-

eter, covers most of the front, 
top part of my arm. It’s slightly 
old-fashioned 
with 
longitude 

and latitude lines filling the 
blank 
oceans. 
There’s 
some 

shading around the globe, with 

the phrase “We need not wait 
to see what others do.” stag-
gered in two lines beneath it, in 
a straight-lettered, all-capital 
type of font.

It’s a Gandhi quote. Look it up.
Where the word “DO” ends, 

a separate, older tattoo begins, 
running parallel to my bicep. 
Two words, 12 letters, “keep 
swimming” is etched in a type-
writer-like font from the middle 
of my bicep to three inches away 
from the top of my shoulder.

I’ve always received interest-

ing but cliché remarks about my 
thoroughly simplistic tattoo. In 
the two years that I’ve had it, the 
comments I receive usually seem 
to fall into one of four categories:

1) General, nice pleasantries: 

“I like your tattoo.”

Thank you for being kind 
 

and respectful.

2) 
Something 
involv-

ing swimming: “Are you on 
 

the swim team?”

Do I really look like I’m on the 

swim team?

3) Finding Nemo themed: 

“Doesn’t 
Dory 
say 
that 
in 
 

‘Finding Nemo’?”

Yes she does, but that doesn’t 

necessarily mean I got a tattoo 
inspired by the movie.

4) And the worst of all — an 

exclusively personal remark: “So 
what’s the real meaning behind 
your tattoo?”

I 
can 
barely 
tell 
my 

best 
friends 
the 
meaning, 

and I’m supposed to tell a 
 

complete stranger?

Now, I’ve added another tat-

too that’s at least five-times 
the size of my original inqui-
ry-maker. Since mid-May, the 
number of times people have 
asked me to lift my shirtsleeve 
to show them the rest of my tat-
toos is innumerable.

A few weeks ago, I was on my 

way home from the Matthaei 
Botanical Gardens with three 

friends when we started discuss-
ing tattoos. I made a comment 
about how I really don’t like 
attention being drawn to mine, 
and one of my friends made an 
interesting remark: “Isn’t that 
what they are for?”

Nearly 
having 
a 
quarter-

sleeve on your upper-right arm 
isn’t really discrete. Whenever 
it’s hotter than 60 degrees out, 
the public catches a glimpse of 
my permanent artwork. I can’t 
be completely rude to random 
strangers for their annoying 
but innocent curiosity about my 
obvious tattoos.

Sure, there’s no need to be 

rude, but those interested in 
others’ tattoos need to be more 
mindful as well. I didn’t spend 
hundreds of dollars that I earned 
to have someone permanently 
put ink into my skin for anybody, 
but me.

After all, it’s me that wakes 

up to the daily reminders on 
my arm, visible in my sightline 
whenever there’s no clothing 
covering it. It’s me who has to 
endure the endless comments 
and jokes about things that are 
deeply meaningful to my life. 
It’s me who wears longer sleeves 
to larger social functions just to 
avoid seemingly critical eyes.

Listening to incessant com-

ments and enduring endless 
staring makes me feel insecure 
about my tattoos, like the words, 
phrases and pictures I’ve decided 
to indelibly mark on my body are 
stupid, worthless or ignorant.

My body is mine, and mine 

alone. I appreciate when people 
admire the tattoos I hold dear 
to my heart, and I honestly 
don’t need validation for my 
decisions. But sometimes, it’d 
be nice if people just kept their 
comments to themselves.

‘True Detective’ re-up, 
ambitious yet uneventful 

TV REVIEW

Season Two premiere 
offers exposition and 

little action

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

Last year, “True Detective” 

premiered on HBO and became 
an instant phenomenon. View-
ers 
followed 

detectives Rust 
Cohle (Matthew 
McConaughey, 
“Interstellar”) 
and Marty Hart 
(Woody Harrel-
son, “The Hun-
ger Games”) into 
the backwaters 
of Louisiana and 
a dark world of 
crime, the occult 
and torment unfolded over eight 
episodes. The announcement of 
the show’s continuation as an 
anthology series, with a new cast 
and location, brought simultane-
ous excitement and speculation. 

Following up such a highly 

regarded first season is not an 
enviable task for creator and sole 
writer, Nic Pizzolatto (“The Kill-
ing”). While crafting the series 
as an anthology allows the show 
an opportunity to book big-name 
talent and start fresh each sea-
son, there’s the burden of what 
came before. Because it falls 
under the name “True Detec-
tive,” Season Two needs to fulfill 
an obfuscated obligation to live 
up to what was established in the 
show’s inaugural season while 
carving out it’s own identity as a 
separate entry in the anthology.

While Season One tackled and 

subverted several of the tropes 
that make up the buddy cop 
genre, Season Two approaches 
the classic film noir narrative. 
Trading the bayous of Louisi-
ana for the more traditional noir 
setting of Southern California 
brings forth multiple tales of 
corruption, depression and the 
morally gray that are bound to 
collide.

All these plotlines are estab-

lished in the first episode, “The 
Western Book of the Dead,” but 

unfortunately the story is spread 
so thin between the main charac-
ters that there is a lack of nuance 
that 
prevents 
anyone 
from 

standing out beyond the broad-
est characterization.

There’s 
Ray 
Velcoro 
(Colin 

Farrell, “In Bruges”), a crooked 
detective in the pocket of crimi-
nal Frank Semyon (Vince Vaughn, 
“The Internship”). Ray initially 
stands out the most from this sea-
son’s characters. The man pos-
sesses no control in his life, forced 
to work for Frank while struggling 
to expand his custody for a son, 
Chad (Trevor Larcom, “Fresh Off 
the Boat”), who might not even 
be his. The only consolation Ray 
gets is in the bottle or by violently 
lashing out at those around him. 
However, Ray is driven so quickly 
to the extreme, tracking down 
one of Chad’s bullies and beat-
ing up the boy’s father in front of 
him, it comes to question whether 
this character has any chance of 
being humanly sympathetic.

In contrast, Frank appears to 

be heading down the right path, 
finding a way to go through some 
rail project involving federal 
money that isn’t explained very 
well. The project is “A chance for 
the grandkids to be part of the 
old California families, where 
they don’t even know where the 
money comes from,” Semyon 
claims. Everything is in place, 
until Semyon’s partner in the 
venture goes missing. Vaughn is 
the biggest risk for this season, a 
traditionally comic actor taking 
on a much darker role compared 
to his usual fare. But so far the 
character hasn’t provided enough 

for Vaughn to show whether he 
was the right choice for the job.

The cycle of misery extends 

to all the other characters in 
“True Detective.” Detective Ani 
Bezzerides (Rachel McAdams, 
“Sherlock Holmes”) deals with 
unresolved issues with her cult-
ish father (David Morse, “The 
Hurt Locker”), who may be con-
nected to the disappearance of a 
young woman. McAdams gives 
a solid, stone cold demeanor to 
her character but hopefully she 
is more than just, as her father 
puts it, “An extended criticism 
of my values,” a character who 
purely relies on another to define 
her. Meanwhile, Paul Woodrugh 
(Taylor Kitsch, “Friday Night 
Lights”), a highway patrolman 
on leave, is struggling to adjust 
to civilian life after serving as a 
mercenary in Iraq. 

All these characters sound 

familiar, 
archetypes 
already 

established in some form of film, 
television or literature. Their suc-
cess will come from how “True 
Detective” utilizes and twists 
what has come to be expected of 
these types of people, but right 
now they remain stuck in their 
preordained box.

“True Detective” does a lot to 

lay the groundwork for its ambi-
tious redirection, but by doing 
so much, it feels like very little 
is being done. So when the three 
main law enforcement characters 
finally meet at the end of the epi-
sode only a few steps are taken in 
moving the story forward. Hope-
fully, “True Detective” can soon 
make strides instead of trudging 
through a tale of woe. 

‘Inside’ works 
despite its issues

MOVIE REVIEW

By REBECCA LERNER

Daily Arts Writer

As I walked into my home-

town theater full of screaming 
toddlers and side-eyeing tweens 
on the open-
ing night of 
Pixar’s 
lat-

est 
creation 

“Inside Out”, I 
was genuinely 
excited 
for 

them. Know-
ing that most 
of them would 
soon be going 
through 
the 

same 
rather 

lackluster public school mental 
health education that I did, it 
was calming to know that more 
knowledge on the subject was so 
accessible. 

“Inside Out” is a lively journey 

through the mind of eleven-year 
old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias, “The 
Shifting”). Riley is a happy kid 
from Minnesota, mostly because 
her emotions are controlled by 
a very peppy chief emotion, Joy 
(Amy Poehler, “Parks and Rec-
reation”). Joy is both helped and 
hindered by Riley’s other emo-
tions, Fear (Bill Hader, “The 
Skeleton Twins”), Anger (Lewis 
Black, “The Daily Show”), Dis-
gust (Mindy Kaling, “The Mindy 
Project”) and Sadness (Phyllis 
Smith, “The Office”). The per-
sonifications of her emotions all 
amicably fight over a dashboard 
that directs Riley’s behavior and 
over time create her likable per-
sonality manifested in different 
“islands” — Goofball, Hockey, 
Honesty, Friendship and Family. 

A shift occurs when Riley’s 

mother (Diane Lane, “Man of 
Steel”) and father (Kyle Maclach-
lan, 
“Portlandia”) 
decide 
to 

uproot from Minnesota to San 
Francisco. After a beautiful and 
thankfully shortened road trip, 
the family arrives at a dreary 
apartment and finds their fur-
niture will be days late. To add 
to the stress of the situation, 
Riley’s parents start arguing ... 
and the pizza in San Francisco 
has broccoli on it. While trying 
to calm the other emotions, Joy 
insists on keeping a happy face, 

which means excluding Sadness 
from activity. After an argu-
ment, Joy, Sadness and Riley’s 
core memories are thrown into 
the confusing maze of her long-
term memory. They have to navi-
gate long term memory to try to 
make it back to headquarters, 
where they are urgently needed. 
Without them, Riley cannot feel 
joy or sadness, leaving Disgust, 
Anger and Fear to be her primary 
emotions during stressful events 
such as the first day of a new 
school and hockey tryouts. 

What makes “Inside Out” 

special and deserving of the 
hype is not just its visually stun-
ning animation and the likable 
and funny characters; the film 
changes the formula of children’s 
movies fundamentally with one 
characteristic — it doesn’t have 
a villain. All of the characters, 
even ones that would have been 
easy to denigrate with ulterior 
motives, are actively rooting for 
Riley. Unlike other kid’s movies, 
the viewer has to accept that no 
one is inherently good or bad; the 
world is much more complicated 
than that. 

However, as “Inside Out” so 

articulately demonstrates, there 
is a mix of good and bad in every-
thing — including the movie. 
As the film serves as a supple-
ment to mental health educa-
tion, the representation of body 
types must be addressed. Joy, 
the most conventionally “good” 
and likable character, is tall, 
thin and white. Her counterpart 
is Sadness, who is portrayed as 
blue, overweight and wearing a 
droopy turtleneck and glasses. 
For all its other positivity, the 
film unfortunately connects sad-
ness with fatness and happiness 
with beauty. Pixar can do better 
than feeding into stereotypes 
that children constantly absorb 
from other media sources. 

Despite the issues of body 

image, Pixar has created a 
film that will inspire children 
to consider the importance of 
their own feelings and have 
more consideration for those 
around 
them. 
“Inside 
Out” 

is a humorous and engaging 
reminder to pay attention to the 
voices in our heads.

‘Dope’ sure to be classic

MOVIE REVIEW

Plot successfully 

balances the serious 

and lighthearted

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

Starting from the most major 

points, 
let’s 
at 

least try to catego-
rize “Dope,” the 
Rick 
Famuyiwa 

(“The Wood”) pic-
ture that came out 
this past week. 
First, there’s the 
main 
charac-

ters — a group of 
geeky high school 
kids getting their 
shoes stolen in the hallways, orga-
nizing their hip punk band in after 
school classrooms and working 
toward attending big schools like 
Harvard. Who, at the same time, are 
part of a group of teenagers growing 
up in the hood, selling dope through 
an online black market and evading 
the police and other dealers to stay 
on top. Second, there’s where they 
live, Inglewood, CA, with gangs 
blocking off nearly every street cor-
ner and friends shot while waiting in 
line for fast food. Where outrunning 
gangs and cops isn’t downplayed 
exactly, but shown through a lens of 
teenage invincibility — punctuated 
by bouncy ’90s rap, peppered with 
laughter and that indefinite security 
of solidarity under pressure. And 
finally, we have the film itself. Part 
John Hughes adolescent under-
standing, part hood film, part satiri-
cal documentary biopic. Indefinable 
and resistant under the all that shiny 
California sun. “Dope”, overall, is a 

huge success, a piece that expresses 
itself in the space between catego-
ries, following its teenage characters 
as they try to do just the same.

“Dope” introduces high school 

senior Malcolm, played by newcom-
er Shameik Moore, as a classified 
geek whose life consists of obsessing 
over ’90s culture, playing in a make-
shift punk band (called Awreeoh, or 
Oreo, black on the outside but white 
in the middle) and working toward a 
Harvard acceptance. He and his best 
friends, Diggy (Kiersey Clemons, 
“Transparent”) and Jib (Tony Revol-
ori, “The Grand Budapest Hotel”), 
are uncool in a way that’s completely 
cool, with thrift shop style and off-
beat but catchy music that really only 
results in them getting beaten up or 
having their bikes stolen. But, after 
getting themselves into a birthday 
party for a neighborhood dope deal-
er and ending up with a backpack of 
stolen molly and a gun, the group 
must figure out how to navigate the 
landscape of drugs and violence in 
the neighborhood they have always 
been part of. As it turns out, the 
Harvard alum Malcolm interviews 
with is the head of the drug ring he’s 
been pulled into, and instead of judg-
ing Malcolm’s character and smarts 
with a formal sit down talk, AJ 
(Roger Guenveur Smith, “American 
Gangster”) decides that seeing how 
Malcolm handles a situation like 
moving thousands of dollars’ worth 
of dope would be a more than accu-
rate test of self.

The story, though somewhat 

serious in subject matter, is kept 
fresh and optimistic in the way the 
film blurs the line between the fic-
tionally ridiculous and larger top-
ics of race and class. Having to sell 
drugs because your college men-
tor wants to see what you can do is 

as far-fetched as it gets, but being 
pulled into a world of illegal dealing 
because it’s the only option for suc-
cess is all too real for many. In this 
way, “Dope” isn’t a film that’s about 
race or class, holding these issues 
on some untouchable pedestal from 
which we all discuss afar. Instead, 
Famuyiwa tells us a story about 
friendship and growing up and suc-
ceeding, organically addressing how 
race and class might influence any of 
these pivotal moments and play into 
the lives of his characters.

This fresh attitude the film 

holds while exploring the realities 
of a group of kids from Inglewood 
is carried over to the filmmaking 
itself. From the music to the style 
to the issues at play, “Dope” is a 
film that firmly places itself in 2015. 
It’s indie without being inacces-
sible, and honestly one of the only 
films in recent memory where the 
use of technology or social media 
doesn’t feel like a command from 
some high up production exec to 
get some of that Facebook in there!” 
“Dope” presents a film full of cre-
atively edited party sequences, a 
satirical narrator, suspenseful split 
screens, and ordinary moments of 
stupid jokes and laughter — a film 
kept fresh and self aware not only 
through its subject matter but its 
storytelling as well.

“We blur the line between cat-

egory and definition,” Malcolm 
proclaims in his Harvard admis-
sions statement, deciding finally 
that there is no one category to find 
a place in, but success is found in 
the overlap. A focus on teenagers 
growing up in Inglewood that finds 
its voice in the balance between the 
serious and lighthearted, “Dope” 
establishes itself as a fresh, genera-
tional classic.

‘Wives Club’ is 
not ‘Mad Men’

TV REVIEW

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

The day “Mad Men” ended was 

a sad, sad day in the television 
world. But at the same time, the 
show’s writers 
wrapped every-
thing up well — 
leaving us with 
tears 
in 
our 

eyes, 
maybe, 

but 
ultimately 

leaving us with 
a laugh and the 
knowledge that 
the show got 
the 
attention 

and the ending 
it deserved. We felt at peace.

And then, a couple of days 

later, we started twitching from 
the “Mad Men” withdrawal.

ABC jumped at the chance to 

fill that void in our hearts with 
“Astronaut Wives Club,” their 
shiny new period drama. Despite 
being based off of a true story — 
that of the astronauts of the Mer-
cury Project during the Cold War 
era — almost everything about 
“Launch” falls flat.

In the first scene, we are intro-

duced to seven women and their 
husbands at a party in a dizzy-
ing five minutes. There is a lot of 
dancing, a lot of polite yet barbed 
small talk and a lot of judgmental 
looks shooting from this wife to 
that one to that one’s husband. 
Watching these women check 
out the competition — not for 
themselves, but for their hus-
bands, one of whom will be the 
first man launched into orbit — is 
uncomfortable. Watching them 
shoot thinly veiled jibes at each 
other after being introduced is 
painful. 

The women go down to Flor-

ida to surprise their husbands, 
who are working hard — get-
ting drunk, swimming in pools, 
trying to impress other young 
women, etc. A few of these fun-
loving husbands are less than 
happy to see their wives.

After they all find out who will 

be the first man to go to space, 
his wife rejects the home-cooked 
dishes prepared by the other 
women as a gesture of wifely 
solidarity.

Later, she graciously accepts 

the food and emotional support, 
and the episode ends with a cute, 
heartwarming scene of all of the 
women dancing together in cel-
ebration — and anticipation for 
what the following months will 
bring.

This show could’ve be titled 

The Real Housewives of the 
1960’s for the amount of depth 
it holds so far. The treatment 
of women isn’t as nuanced as 
in “Mad Men,” to which it will 
absolutely be compared. It lacks 
the subtle wry humor that “Mad 
Men” had, instead touching only 
briefly on the most superficial 
levels of sexist attitudes of the 
time — if there are jokes, the 
jokes are lost. 

Like the film “The Help,” the 

show is so self-indulgently beau-
tiful — scenes in soft golden sun-
light, flattering camera angles, 
painstakingly perfect hair and 
makeup, 
and 
cherubic 
chil-

dren — that you almost forget it 
is attempting to portray a real 
story. However, the actors do 
the best with what they’ve been 
given, and many of the women 
show promise; if the following 
episodes slow down, flesh out 
the storylines of each couple and 
give each of the wives time and 
space to take a deep breath, we 
will see something more than 
just perfunctory performances. 

“Mad Men” proved that people 

can be captivated by shows that 
shine a spotlight on specific times in 
our history; “The Astronaut Wives 
Club” has a long way to go before it 
can reach the kind of love lavished 
on Don Draper and Peggy Olson. 
The historical detail found in the 
clothing and scenery is amazing; if 
the writing catches up, the acting 
will too. And then maybe — maybe 
— it will give “Mad Men” a run for 
its money. Not likely, though.

Students who benefit from 

financial aid, however, still have

financial aid.

of 
under-

the federal grant for mainly low-

Fifth Edition of the Michigan

of students from higher-income 
backgrounds.

According to Deborah Greene 

from the Office of Public Affairs, 
the University does not have 
socioeconomic data for all Uni-

rates. In an e-mail to the Daily, 
she said the Office of Budget

Pell Grant recipients is the best 
estimate of graduation rate data 
based on Socioeconomic status.

Students receiving Pell Grants, 

who are an economic minority on

lower-income students, graduate 
at lower rates than the Univer-

In 2008, 85% of students

Former greats, 
future stars join 
forces in all-QB 

camp at Big House

By ZACH SHAW

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Jedd Fisch huddled his team 

up. With a bit of the game under 
its belt, Michigan’s passing game 
coordinator was ready to push his 
team to the next level.

It wasn’t enough to just throw 

hard, 
he 

explained 
to 

the team. They 
needed 
to 
be 

selective, 
pick 

their spots and 
find a way to 
win.

“Let’s 
get 

creative, 
we’re 

quarterbacks!”

The 
group 

trotted back out 
to the field. There were no receiv-
ers, linemen, pads or even foot-
balls, but the intensity was in full 
bloom. These quarterbacks had a 
dodgeball game to win.

Welcome to Quarterback U.
Michigan has been known for 

years for its ability to produce suc-
cessful quarterbacks. Whether it’s 

the versatility of Rick Leach and 
John Wangler, the grit of Jim Har-
baugh, the precision of Elvis Grbac 
and Todd Collins, the cannons of 
Chad Henne and John Navarre 
or the creativity and charisma of 
Denard Robinson and Devin Gard-
ner, the Wolverines have been able 
to turn productive quarterbacks 
into professional athletes in each 
of the past five decades. That’s no 
coincidence.

It was also no coincidence that 

such tradition was on display Sat-
urday, with many Michigan greats 
on hand for the dodgeball, base-
ball and soccer festivities in Ann 

Arbor’s 
Aerial 

Assault, a camp 
dedicated solely 
to quarterbacks.

But the inau-

gural 
camp 

wasn’t just fun 
and games. The 
A4 camp kicked 
off the newest 
era of Quarter-
back U, in which 
Harbaugh 
and 

his staff will pull out every stop 
imaginable to mix old school and 
new school to concoct Michigan’s 
greatest leader yet.

That mission began in a big way 

Saturday, as the Michigan greats 
were joined by 15 NFL quarter-
backs such as Jay Cutler and Greg 
McElroy, “QB gurus” such as Ken 

Mastrole and Dowell Loggains 
and the Michigan coaching staff, 
littered with coaches with NFL 
and college experience.

“As many resources as you can 

possibly have,” Harbaugh said.

And while outsiders — and maybe 

a few campers — would laugh at the 
idea of playing baseball or dodgeball 
at a one-day camp for quarterbacks, 
the games had as much of a point as 
the fine-tuning or speeches about 
the position — as Michigan has said 
time and again that the most suc-
cessful quarterbacks are athletes 
who can learn to lead at anything, 
including other sports.

“You could tell some guys didn’t 

really know how to throw a base-
ball,” said Collins, who led the 
Wolverines in 1993 and 1994 before 
a 15-year NFL career. “I played 
three sports in high school and 
most of us were multi-sport ath-
letes, but now there’s an increase 
in specialization and most of these 
guys are training year-round.

“You need to be athletic to play 

quarterback.”

The campers also had to listen, 

because 
like 

everything else 
in his life, Har-
baugh made the 
camp 
a 
com-

petition. In his 
quest 
for 
the 

new model of 
Michigan quar-
terbacks, 
any 

dissenters were shown the door.

“Hopefully that doesn’t offend 

anybody that this will be a com-
petitive environment,” he said. “I 
hope everybody is OK with that. 
Because if you’re not, guess what? 
You’re playing the wrong position. 
You’re literally playing the wrong 
position if that’s an issue.

“You touch the ball every snap, 

so it’s important that you learn to 
win and do well. Most important-
ly, it’s important that you learn to 
compete and you embrace it.”

Ultimately, Michigan four-star 

2016 commit Brandon Peters suc-
ceeded in enough of the drills and 
competitions to win the all-around 
title. But the quest for a champion-
ship-caliber quarterback will rage 
well beyond the camp.

That’s why Michigan’s roster 

will boast at least 10 quarterbacks 
in the fall — more than any team in 
a power-five conference, because, 
to Harbaugh, you can’t put a price 
on a quality leader.

“While other positions don’t 

put quite as much pressure on the 

quarterback position, anybody can 
tell you that’s played the position, 
you should already know by now 
that playing quarterback matters. 
There’s a lot riding on it.”

Added Jack Harbaugh, who 

was the quarterbacks coach when 
Michigan 
began 
earning 
the 

label Quarterback U with Dennis 
Franklin in 1972: “The quarter-
back position is like no other posi-
tion — there’s only one of you. You 

have four defen-
sive backs, you 
have three or 
four linebackers, 
you have four 
defensive 
line-

men, but there’s 
only one quar-
terback.”

Saturday was 

only the beginning of Michigan’s 
quest, as the relentless recruiting 
tactics of Harbaugh and his staff 
won’t quit even if the results come.

The quarterback factory has 

been remodeled, and the result is a 
model unlike anything else in the 
country. No other school has had a 
camp like this, no other school has 
Michigan’s history and no other 
school has brought it all together 
on one field before.

“If you’re a quarterback leav-

ing high school, where else do you 
want to go to get to the NFL or 
maximize your talent than here?” 
Collins said. “I’m a little bit biased, 
but there’s truth to it.”

Years from now, Quarterback 

U graduates will litter the NFL. 
They’ll have the arm of Henne, 
the craftiness of Robinson, the 
toughness of Collins, the fire of 
Harbaugh and the desire to do 
anything it takes to win, no matter 
the level.

You can bet they’ll be damn 

good at dodgeball, too. Welcome to 
Quarterback U.

Denard switches to 
RB for NFL career

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

At Jim Harbaugh’s Ann Arbor 

Aerial Assault camp Saturday, it 
was clear that I wasn’t the only 
person who remembered Denard 
Robinson.

When Harbaugh split the quar-

terback pool into groups, the fans 
followed the one that Denard led 
to Al Glick Field House.

When there was a break in 

the action, fans whipped out the 

sharpies, anxiously hoping for an 
opportunity to get his autograph.

When it was time to walk back 

to the stadium for lunch, the Mich-
igan faithful held their phones 
at the ready, in anticipation of an 
opportunity to get a picture with 
the man they know as “Shoelace.” 
Never mind the dozens of other 
NFL and Michigan quarterbacks, 
it was Denard!

But in reality, his days of con-

trolling the huddle are over. A lack 
of throwing prowess and abun-

dance of running abilities made 
him an appealing choice for the 
Jacksonville Jaguars at running 
back — a whole new position. 
Thanks to his time under center 
in the maize and blue, however, 
that transition was easier than 
Robinson expected.

As 
the 
Jaguar 
speedster 

described, the key to his posi-
tional transition is that he 
learned to read defenses as a 
quarterback, giving him an 
upper hand at the highest level.

“Being able to see blitzes and 

stuff helped me more,” Robin-
son said. “As a quarterback you 
have to know where the blitz is 
coming from so you can turn the 

protection up. As a running back 
now, you look at it, I say ‘Here is 
a rotation from the safety, now if 
the safety tops the linebacker or 
nickel will.’

“Now you know he might 

be coming and I can see that. 
Little things like that help me 
as a running back, because as a 
quarterback you had to turn the 
protection that way or send differ-
ent things to help.”

Though Robinson hasn’t put 

up eye-popping number thus far 
in his NFL career, his stats speak 
for the strides he is making to 
improve.

In 2013, his rookie season, Rob-

inson was given just 20 running 
attempts, which yielded no touch-
downs, three fumbles and 3.3 
yards per carry.

But 2014 showed the impact 

that Robinson can have from his 
new position down the road.

The coaching staff entrust-

ed Robinson with 135 running 
attempts, and he treated those 
carries with care — conceding 
just two fumbles. He increased his 
yards per carry to 4.3, while accu-
mulating 
four 

touchdowns and 
582 total yards.

Specifically, 

he became the 
first 
Jaguars 

running back to 
boast 
back-to-

back 
100-yard 

performances 
since 
Maurice 

Jones-Drew in 2011. Packaged 
into those performances was Rob-
inson’s longest rush of the season 
— a 41-yard burst against Miami 
on a misdirection.

He showed glimpses of being 

a dual-threat as a receiver out of 
the backfield as well, tallying 23 
receptions for 124 yards.

Robinson credited part of his 

fluid NFL transition to another 
former 
Michigan 
quarterback, 

Chad Henne. The two gear up next 
to each other before every game 
and share adjacent lockers, and 
Robinson said that has fostered a 
relationship in which he can easily 
get in contact with Henne.

One 
of 
Robinson’s 
biggest 

issues in the NFL has been accli-
mating to a situation in which he 
doesn’t serve as a dual threat as a 
scrambling quarterback, but that 

doesn’t stop him from continuing 
to embrace his love for the game.

“Now they’re (only) accounting 

for you as a runner. In college they 
didn’t account for me. Well, teams 
did after a while, after I made 
them pay,” Robinson said with 
a laugh. “Now they account for 

me as a runner, 
and they make 
sure 
they’ve 

got someone (to 
cover) you.

“For the most 

part, it’s still the 
same thing. Still 
playing football, 
still having fun 
and enjoying it. I 

mean it’s the biggest stage, so I just 
enjoy playing football, being in a 
team environment, all that stuff.”

Yesterday, Robinson was coach-

ing campers through a drill aimed 
at hitting a receiver running a 
fade route to the corner of the end 
zone, and he gave his apprentices 
one rule: if you score a touchdown, 
give him a celebration to watch.

And while there’s no telling 

what’s in store for Robinson in the 
2015 campaign, it’s obvious that 
he has embraced the challenge of 
succeeding at a position that is for-
eign to him at the most competi-
tive level.

He’s a running back now. But 

with the calculated mind of a 
Michigan quarterback still active 
in the NFL, Robinson may be giv-
ing them a celebration to watch 
instead.

“(I’m) still 

playing football, 
still having fun.”

FOOTBALL
Jack Harbaugh reflects on bringing up quarterbacks

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

At Michigan football coach Jim 

Harbaugh’s Aerial Assault quarter-
back camp on the eve of Father’s 
Day, it was only fitting that one of 
the most famous fathers in Michi-
gan football history was standing 
on the sideline.

Wearing a white Michigan pull-

over, khaki pants and a familiar 
wide grin, former Michigan assis-
tant coach Jack Harbaugh stood 
and watched his son address the 
hundreds of campers on the field at 
Michigan Stadium early Saturday 
morning.

The camp already boasted the 

presence of numerous current and 
former Michigan and NFL quarter-
backs — “as many resources as you 
can possibly have,” Jim would say.

But Jack had come to the Big 

House with Rick Kaepernick, 

father of current San Francisco 
49ers quarterback and former Jim 
Harbaugh pupil Colin Kaepernick, 
to deliver a unique message about 
raising greatness — one aimed just 
as much at the parents in the stands 
as the sons on the field.

“What a journey,” Jack said. 

“Looking back, when our young-
sters — (current Baltimore Ravens 
coach) John, Jim and daughter 
Joani — went through these types 
of experiences, the things we 
shared as parents, we found there’s 
really three things.

“We used to have a sign here at 

Michigan, that’s probably the best 
way to tell you. ‘Whatever you 
vividly imagine, ardently believe, 
enthusiastically act upon will inev-
itably come to pass.’ ”

A paraphrased quote from Paul 

J. Meyer, a businessman and phi-
lanthropist who created a founda-
tion based on motivating people for 

success, this philosophy perfectly 
applied to Jack’s experience raising 
a young quarterback.

According to Jack, the first 

step of vivid imagination starts 
with childhood daydreaming — in 
Jim’s case, adolescent fantasies of 
becoming a star quarterback.

The second step is the most 

important. Once a child “ardently 
believes” they can do something, 
Jack said, that’s when it’s time for 
a parent to step in.

“Once you find out they have the 

passion and love for something, 
and they’re willing to believe in it 
and willing to work for it, now I’m 
gonna do everything as a parent to 
help you achieve that goal,” Jack 
said.

In Jim’s case, helping him 

achieve his goal meant instilling in 
him the competitive fire necessary 
to play the quarterback position. 
That fire is the reason why, even at a 

camp where everyone has an equal 
opportunity to learn, Jim installed a 
leaderboard on the stadium jumbo-
tron to directly pit the young quar-
terbacks against each other.

“It kind of tells you who Jim 

Harbaugh is,” Jack said. “What 
you have to do to be the number 
one quarterback, you have to take 
someone else’s job. And if you 
aren’t competitive, and you don’t 
like competition, and this kind of 
bothers you ... you might want to 
look at a different position.”

A 
young 
quarterback 
also 

requires plenty of wisdom and 
advice. Just like Jack, a coach for 
40 years, was able to impart that 
wisdom on his son growing up, 
Jim surrounded his young campers 
with walking sources of quarter-
back knowledge.

Nearly 40 years of Michigan 

quarterbacks coached at the camp, 
including Rick Leach, who started 

for four years when Jack Harbaugh 
was on the coaching staff in the 
1970s.

“To see (Leach) out there work-

ing with other quarterbacks 40 
years later, that’s what Michigan 
tradition is all about,” Jack said.

After Jim finished his opening 

remarks and Leach, Denard Rob-
inson and the other seasoned vet-
erans began to instruct the next 
generation of quarterbacks, Jack 
wandered up into the stands. As 
he looked at the young faces on the 
field — plenty of which were show-
ing signs of vivid imagination or 
ardent belief — he easily identified 
with the parents seated around 
him.

“It’s not my goal, it’s not my 

dream, it’s (the kids’) dream,” Jack 
remembered thinking. “And I’m 
gonna do everything in my power 
to make sure that I give them every 
chance to achieve that goal.”

Rudock, Morris ready to 
battle for starting QB job

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Writer

A competition was brewing 

in Ann Arbor, and it wasn’t just 
between the high school quarter-
backs pitted against one another at 
Michigan’s Aerial Assault quarter-
back camp.

Two camp counselors were bat-

tling as well. Junior quarterback 
Shane Morris and Iowa graduate 
transfer quarterback Jake Rudock 
helped coach over 200 students 
Saturday, and both made it clear 
that they intend to continue that 
leadership into the fall.

“I think I can win the starting 

job because I have the mentality to 
do so,” Morris said. “Right now it’s 
my job to lose. I’m just gonna keep 
working hard and not let my com-
petitors take it away from me.”

Though he stopped short of 

naming 
himself 
the 
favorite, 

Rudock has no intention of sitting 
on the bench for his final year of 
eligibility.

“I mean, I want to play. I think 

every guy who’s in that locker room 
wants to go out and play.”

Morris made his only start of 

the 2014 season against Minne-
sota on Sept. 27, when he com-
pleted 7-of-19 passes for 49 yards 
and threw one interception. Mor-
ris made four other appearances, 
and completed 14-of-40 passes for 
128 yards and three interceptions 
overall.

Morris believes that his team-

mates view him as their leader.

“You gotta keep working hard 

every day,” Morris said. “You have 
to show up to practice every day 
with the same mentality: that 
you’re competing for your job. 
That’s college football, that’s why 
I’m here.”

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

said that the junior quarterback 
outperformed his teammates in the 
Spring Game, but that was before 
Rudock was on campus.

Rudock arrived in Ann Arbor 

just five weeks ago, but the transi-
tion hasn’t been difficult for the 
fifth-year senior. Without classes 
to take until the fall, Rudock spends 
most of his time in Michigan’s foot-
ball facilities.

“(Playing for Michigan) was 

weird for the first week,” Rudock 
said. “But these are my brothers 
now. I still have great friendships at 
Iowa, but I’m feeling comfortable 
with the guys and (Ann Arbor).”

After starting at Iowa for two 

seasons and throwing just five 
interceptions in 2014, the fewest of 
any starting Big Ten quarterback, 
Rudock believes his experience can 
help him win the job.

“I’ve had to compete every single 

year at Iowa, so this is very similar 
in that regard,” Rudock said. “In 
Big Ten football, you have to earn 
everything you get, that’s just the 
name of the game, that’s how foot-
ball is, and that’s a big Coach Har-
baugh thing.

“Nothing is ever given, it’s 

earned.”

Rudock’s main concern is mesh-

ing with his new teammates and 
learning the Michigan offense, 
which is mostly pro-style with 
some West Coast mixed through-
out.

At Iowa, Rudock played pro-

style, and that previous experience 
will help him in the battle.

Former Michigan quarterbacks 

Denard Robinson and Devin Gard-
ner were also at the camp, and they 
made it clear that competition is 
healthy and expected. Even though 
both players are gone and gradu-
ated, they’re still competing with 
one another.

“I’m pretty sure Devin would 

say the same thing, that he thinks 
he’s better than me (at quarter-
back),” Robinson said. “We’re both 
competitive, so of course I’m gonna 
say yes, (I think I’m better).

“That’s the one thing I tell Shane, 

just do the best you can and at the 
end of the day you can live with 
yourself and say, ‘I did everything I 
could possibly do to be a starter.’ He 
has the talent. He has everything a 
quarterback needs to be a starter 
here. He can take the team to the 
Rose Bowl or the National Cham-
pionship.”

Confidence and competition are 

key at the quarterback position, 
and there doesn’t appear to be a 
lack of either on Morris’ part.

“You know, (Rudock) came here 

to take my job, and I’m just not 
going to let it happen.”

KELLY HALL/Daily

Graduate Iowa transfer Jake Rudock arrived in Ann arbor five weeks ago, and will try to beat out nine others for the quarterback job.

Harbaugh added a new four-star

and Saturday. Freshman defense-
man Zach Werenski impressed 
this year, playing in 35 games with 
nine goals, 16 assists and 25 points. 
He was ranked ninth among North

ing Michigan two probable first-
round picks.

Fellow incoming freshmen Bren-

dan Warren, Cooper Marody, Nick

Over a dozen NFL 
players and coaches 
convene at Pioneer 
for free youth camp

By ZACH SHAW

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Mighty Mike Martin has been 

a hit with Michigan fans for 
years. 

After winning state champi-

onships in football, wrestling 
and shot put at Detroit Catholic 
Central, turning himself into an 
All-Big Ten defensive lineman 
at Michigan, then becoming a 
successful Tennessee Titan, it’s 
tempting to call 
Mighty 
Mar-

tin a hometown 
hero.

But on Satur-

day, with kids 
draped around 
his 
tree-trunk 

legs and an even 
wider 
smile 

on his face, it 
wasn’t Martin’s 
mightiness that 
made him a hero. Instead, at the 
first annual Mike Martin Youth 
Football Camp, a free camp for 

elementary and middle school 
athletes held at Pioneer High 
School, it was 
Magnetic 
Mike 
Martin 

who was mak-
ing everyone’s 
day.

“He went to 

a lot of these 
camps 
when 

he was young,” 
said Theresa O’Hara, Martin’s 
mom. “With the men he saw 
(back then), he wants to emu-
late that. Not just the qualities of 
being a football player, but giv-
ing, working hard for something 
and dreaming big.

“He’s got such a big heart and 

is 
so 
person-

able. Even when 
he was at Mich-
igan, he would 
get right down 
at the kids’ level 
and would sign 
their shirts and 
hats. He’s got 
this 
magnetic 

personality.”

The 
camp 

was complete-

ly free for Metro Detroit kids. 
Growing up going to similar 
camps, Martin knew how impor-

tant it was to make the camp 
accessible and worthwhile.

He 
bussed 

campers in from 
his hometown of 
Redford, 
talked 

and signed auto-
graphs for anyone 
who asked, and 
made sure that 
— with a dozen 
NFL players help-

ing out, a full-service DJ and the 
Detroit Pistons’ Flight Crew per-
forming a trampoline dunk show 
— it was more than just a day at the 
football field.

“The big thing for me is to get 

everyone out here,” Martin said. 
“At first the camp was limited to 
200 kids, then we made it 300, 
then we moved it to 350. It was 
hard to say no, but I’m glad every-
one is having a good time, because 
that’s what it’s all about.

“Trying to connect communities 

and make it go full circle, bringing 
all the kids together and trying to 
do something good — get the kids 
excited about learning new stuff 
and getting to know everyone.”

Martin’s camp wasn’t the first 

free youth camp held by an NFL 
player, and it certainly won’t be 
the last. Michigan has endorsed 
giving back to the community 

for years, and numerous play-
ers have taken that beyond their 
time in Ann Arbor. 

Nearly all of Martin’s assis-

tants on Saturday have had their 
own camps or events, and they 
were happy to make the trek to 
Pioneer on their 
own 
dime 
to 

return the favor.

“A lot of guys 

who play foot-
ball came from 
bad areas or not 
the best areas, 
and the opportu-
nity to give back 
is 
huge,” 
said 

Taylor Lewan, a 
2014 first-round 
draft pick and former All-Amer-
ican offensive tackle at Michi-
gan. “If you can take one kid and 
inspire him to give back to his 
community someday, then you’re 
helping things come full circle.”

Less than a quarter mile away 

from Michigan Stadium, Martin’s 
charisma had brought everyone 
together. It was clear that it was a 
special event for everyone.

“We can relate to a lot of the 

things they’re saying because we 
know the area and a bit of what 
they go through,” said Brandon 
Graham, a former Detroit native 
and Michigan standout who cur-
rently plays for the Philadelphia 
Eagles. “You might have gone to 
the same schools or know some 

of the same people. The conver-
sation and connection is there 
because you’re from the same 
place. You feel right at home.”

While drills and condition-

ing were a part of the event, the 
primary focus was on inspiration 

and fun. Mich-
igan 
coach 

Greg Mattison 
was among the 
many 
speak-

ers, all empha-
sizing respect 
and dedication 
to 
anything 

you do. After 
that, NFL stars 
and kids alike 
were 
drawn 

together for scrimmages, races 
and all-around fun.

So to Magnetic Mike Martin, 

it was mission accomplished.

“It’s amazing, man. I’ve gone to 

other camps to help out, and I’ve 
never had my own,” Martin said. 
“So to turn the tables and for me 
to be the guy hosting it, especially 
with kids from my hometown, it 
hasn’t really sunk in yet, but it’s 
special.”

“I’ve known Mike for a long 

time,” Lewan said. “Just to see 
him around people, he’s always 
smiling always there for every-
one, so it’s only fitting that 
there’s going to be a few hundred 
kids here running around and 
having a blast.”
