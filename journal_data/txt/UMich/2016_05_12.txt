‘U’ and Ann Arbor schools 
address e-waste recycling

New Trotter 
facility name
sparks worry 
in students

Residents drop 

off electronics for 
proper disposal

By IRENE PARK

Daily Summer News Editor

The University of Michigan’s 

Office of Campus Sustainability 
partnered with Ann Arbor Public 
Schools for the University’s annual 
e-waste recycling event — which 
aims to help community members 
dispose and recycle electrical or 
electronic devices — Saturday in 
Pioneer High School’s parking lot.

The annual event began in 

spring 2008, around the same time 
the Climate Savers Computing 
Initiative — a campus campaign 
aimed at promoting sustainable 
computer use — and Sustainable 
Computing program began at the 
University. Since then, events have 
collected 1,792 tons of e-waste.

The events are open to anyone 

who wants to recycle his or her 
e-waste, including non Ann Arbor 
residents.

E-waste specifically refers to any 

discarded electrical or electronic 
devices, including cell phones, 

televisions, stereos and wires. 
Last year, the United Nations 
Environment Program referred 
to it as the fastest growing waste 
stream in the world. A study in 2013 
estimated a 33 percent growth of 
e-waste worldwide by 2017, about 
72 million tons total.

Incorrect disposal of e-wastes 

can create serious health hazards, 
especially in developing countries, 
where developed countries often 
dump 
their 
e-wastes. 
Many 

electronic gadgets contain toxic 
metals such as mercury, lead and 
cadmium, which can seep into the 
ground and contaminate water 
sources. Exposure to such toxic 
metals can cause damage to the 
nervous systems, kidneys and 
bones of both adults and developing 
fetuses. 

MaryBeth Stuenkel, University 

Information 
and 
Technology 

program manager and a volunteer 
at Saturday’s event, said recycling 
e-waste is not only a way to 
reduce the amount that ends up 
in landfills or water, but it’s also a 
way to reuse valuable resources for 
new electronic products without 
harming the environment. For 
example, producing one ounce 
of gold requires mining and 

processing seven to 11 tons of ore, 
but gold can also be extracted from 
e-waste.

“It’s a double reason to recycle 

(the e-waste),” Stuenkel said. “They 
are dangerous to the environment 
plus they are valuable resources 
that can be reclaimed and reused. 
That benefits the environments 
in another way — if you have gold 
from recycled materials, then you 
don’t have be mining for gold.”

Stuenkel 
said 
the 
most 

common items people recycle 
at the events are old television 
sets. 
Unfortunately, 
these 

television sets do not contain as 
much precious metal that can 
be recycled as computers do, 
according to Stuenkel, adding that 
old televisions comprise mostly of 
plastic and glass.

Stuenkel also mentioned that 

she and rest of the University’s 
Sustainable Computing program 
were surprised by the increasing 
turnout of e-waste recycling in Ann 
Arbor since 2008, with the number 
of cars attending increasing from 
3,548 in 2010 to 7,000 in 2015.

“When we started doing this in 

2008, we expected the number of 
cars dropping off the waste to taper 
off,” Stuenkel said.

CAMPUS LIFE

Students voice 

mixed reactions in 
response to naming 

of new building

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Summer News Editor

Several students voiced concern 

over the University of Michigan’s 
decision to name the new building 
which will house the William 
Trotter Multicultural Center after 
Regent Mark Bernstein and his wife, 
Rachel Bendit. The building’s new 
name — Bernstein-Bendit Hall — 
comes after the University laudeda 
$3 million gift from the couple three 
weeks ago. The donation will help 
build the new facility, which will 
move from its current Washtenaw 
Ave. address to a more centrally 
located spot on South State Street. 

A number of students protested 

the name on social media, arguing 
it erased the legacy of the center’s 
current 
namesake: 
William 

Trotter— 
the 
prominent 
Black 

activist and co-founder of the 
Niagara Movement, a civil rights 
organization founded in 1905.

Trotter director Jackie Simpson 

refuted these claims. She said the 
legacy of both Trotter will remain 
intact despite concerns surrounding 
the decision to rename the center.

“I’ve 
heard 
many 
student 

concerns that the legacy of Trotter 
was going away,” Simpson said. “It’s 
not going to happen.”

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel addressed the controversy 
in an open letterposted on the 
Trotter Center’s Facebook page, 
in which he drew comparisons to 
the Ford School of Public Policy — 
named for former President Gerald

Members talk faculty 
transparency, student 

substance abuse

By ANDREW HIYAMA

Daily Staff Reporter

During 
Tuesday’s 
Senate 

Advisory 
Committee 
on 

University 
Affairs 
meeting, 

members discussed various new 
initiatives proposed in last week’s 
meeting, including measures to 
increase transparency through 
document 
sharing, 
expansion 

of the Senate Assembly and 
increased interactions with the 
Board of Regents. The committee 
members additionally canceled 
their upcoming meeting due to 
a limited number of members 
able to attend as well as plans to 

reduce the number of meetings 
throughout the summer months. 

In another effort to increase 

faculty 
transparency, 
the 

committee discussed a proposal 
to require all Senate Assembly 
Committees 
to 
publish 
their 

meeting minutes, as well as 
archiving 
SACUA 
meeting 

material on Mbox — a Univeristy 
file sharing platform. It was not 
made clear whether this material 
would be open to the public.

The committee also discussed 

the possibility of expanding the 
Senate Assembly. LSA professor 
and SACUA member Silke-Maria 
Weineck pointed out that the 
Senate Assembly was no longer 
representative of the faculty due 
to the faculty’s increasing size.

“The faculty has tripled and 

the Senate Assembly has stayed 
the same number,” Weineck said.

Pharmacy 
professor 
and 

SACUA committee member David 
Smith suggested an increase in 
the 
number 

of 
Senate 

Assembly 
members and, 
consequently, 
increasing 
the 
number 

required 
for 

quorum would 
affect decrease 
the efficacy of 
the Assembly.

“That might 

have a negative effect,” Smith 
said

SACUA 
Chair 
William 

Schultz, a professor in the 
College of Engineering, also 
questioned 
whether 
SACUA 

accurately represented the entire 
University’s faculty, offering the 
possibility of reserving a SACUA 
seat for a faculty member from 
the Flint or Dearborn campuses.

Schultz 
also 
stated 
an 

initiative 
to 
add 
attendance 

at the University’s Board of 
Regents Meetings to the duties 
of the SACUA liaison — a 
member who sits in on other 
Univeristy bodies as an observer. 

The committee decided to send 
at least one SACUA member to 
each of the Regents meetings 
in a public capacity to keep 
members of SACUA informed on 
administrative affairs. 

Schultz 
then 
moved 
to 

request a volunteer to attend 
the biennial meeting of Alcohol 
and Other Drugs — a division of 
the University Health Service 
focused on preventing substance 
abuse. 
He 
said 
the 
SACUA 

representative should bring the 

committee’s 
former proposal 
to 
increase 

the number of 
Friday morning 
classes to the 
meeting.

“Remember 

the 
Friday 

morning 
class 

initiative 
was 

nipping 
away 

at a problem, 

that’s reducing by one day a 
week –– one night a week –– our 
students indulging too much,” 
Schultz said. “But I think it would 
be nice to perhaps even consider 
what further things we could do, 
because it certainly is a problem.”

Additionally, 
Schultz 

expressed a desire to publish 
a newsletter once or twice a 
semester, 
summarizing 
the 

actions and accomplishments of 
SACUA, and a desire to promote 
greater committee involvement 
in the newsletter, as opposed to it 
being a sole effort of the SACUA 
chair, as it has been in previous 
years.

‘U’ faculty members elected to join 
the National Academy of Sciences

New study links education to depression in Black men

Four new inductees 
bring total University 

membership to 29

By ISHI MORI

Daily Staff Reporter

Four University of Michigan 

faculty members were elected as 
members to the National Academy 
of Sciences — one of the highest 
honors in academia in the United 
States —Tuesday.

Members of NAS are selected 

for their exceptional achievements 
and contributions to research 
and their responsibilities include 
advising the members of the 
federal government on science, 
engineering and medicine. The 
University’s four inductees join 
2,291 active members and 465 
foreign 
associates. 
This 
year 

brought 84 newly elected members 
to NAS nationwide.

The professors inducted — 

Stephen Forrest, Judith Irvine, 
Susan 
Murphy 
and 
Melanie 

Sanford — also bring the total 
number 
of 
active 
University 

faculty members in the NAS to 29.

Irvine, 
the 
Edward 
Sapir 

Collegiate Professor of Linguistic 

Anthropology, was elected for 
her research on language use 
in African social life, such as in 
local politics, in creating and 
expressing social hierarchy and 
in the making and destruction of 
social difference.

Irvine found her election to the 

NAS to be a joyful surprise, as her 
field is uncommon among NAS 
members.

“I was completely astonished to 

be elected to NAS – an unlooked-
for honor and… unusual for my 
field,” Irvine wrote in an e-mail 
interview. “There are linguists in 
the Psychology section but not so 
much in Anthropology, though 
some in the past.”

Forrest, the Peter A. Franken 

Distinguished 
University 

Professor of Engineering and 
Paul G. Goebel Professor of 
Engineering, was already elected 
to the National Academy of 
Engineering in 2003 prior to his 
NAS election.

Forrest, 
who 
specializes 

in electrical engineering and 
material science, was elected to 
the NAS for his lifelong work 
that led to breakthroughs in the 
understanding of soft materials, 
which can be easily deformed by 
thermal stresses or fluctuations at 

room temperature. His previous 
election to the NAE was based on 
the exploitation of the materials 
and structures he developed for 
applications including fiber optic 
communications and displays.

Forrest wrote in an e-mail 

that his goal is to secure a 
more sustainable future with 
his research , adding that his 
membership in the NAS can bring 
him one step closer.

“I 
work 
at 
the 
very 

interdisciplinary 
boundary 

between 
materials, 
physics 

and engineering, primarily on 
photonic (that is optical) devices 
for displays, lighting and solar 
cells,” 
Forrest 
wrote. 
“Since 

lighting and solar cells both affect 
our use and generation of energy, 
you can see that I have a deep 
interest 
in 
sustainability 
and 

helping the world toward greater 
independence from fossil fuel.”

Murphy 
was 
elected 
for 

her research on mobile health 
platforms, 
specifically 
for 

developing 
algorithms 
for 

wearable devices which deliver 
individually tailored treatments.

 New University 

research finds high 

school diploma 

increases risk factors 

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Despite 
the 
fact 
that 
an 

education acts as a protective 
factor against depression for most 
social groups, it is conversely a 
risk factor for depression among 
Black men, according to a recent 
University of Michigan study.

Soon 
to 
be 
published 
in 

Frontiers 
in 
Public 
Health, 

the 
findings 
suggest 
certain 

intersections of race and gender 

can lead to negative mental and 
physical health conditions with 
relation to education.

Shervin 
Assari, 
University 

professor of psychiatry and lead 
author of the study, said this 
research — along with other 
studies he has done regarding 
the interactions between race, 
gender and depressive symptoms 
— has important social and public 
policy implications.

Assari used data from the 

Americans’ 
Changing 
Lives 

study 
from 
the 
University’s 

Institute for Social Research. 
The study followed a nationally 
representative sample of more 
than 3,600 men and women for 
25 years from 1986 to 2011. The 
longitudinal 
study 
collected 

data regarding a range of social, 
psychological 
and 
behavioral 

factors, according to its website.

According to the Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention, 
5.6 percent of Blacks experience 
moderate depressive symptoms 
as compared to 4.3 percent of 
non-Hispanic whites.

For the most recent study, 

Assari focused on two outcomes 
— 
depressive 
symptoms 
and 

the number of current medical 
conditions — to survey how 
education can protect against 
depressive symptoms in white 
men, white women, Black women 
and Black men.

Assari said there are multiple 

things that can be considered 
protective factors — aspects of 

life which promote health and 
well-being — but his research 
focused solely on education and 
income.

“These types of resources help 

the individual avoid risk and 
minimize the consequence of 
risks when they happen,” Assari 
said. “When you have education, 
education is the risk resource 
for you not to get the medical 
conditions that lower-educated 
or people with lower education 
would be at higher risk for. These 
are types of social resources that 
an individual can use to navigate.”

The study looked at how 

baseline education — such as 
the number of years in school or 
the type of degree or credentials 
earned — influences behavior. 

Assari wanted to see how baseline 
education could predict change in 
depressive symptoms and chronic 
medical conditions over 25 years. 

According to Assari, for both 

white men and white women, 
having a high school diploma is 
protective 
against 
depressive 

symptoms, yet for Black women, 
having these credentials neither 
protects 
nor 
increases 
the 

risk. For Black men, however, 
education correlates with an 
increase in the risk of depression.

“In all groups, (education) is 

protective with one exception, 
which is Black men,” Assari 
said. “If other people have a 
high school diploma, they are 
definitely not at higher risk of

Don’t waste your vote

Bring back the written word
A 

little while back, I was 
texting a friend from home. 
We were catching up and 

I told her that 
my grandfather 
had just passed 
away, so I’d gone 
to Florida for the 
funeral. Almost 
immediately, she texted me back a 
red heart emoji. When I saw it, I was 
touched. But at the same time, I was a 
little taken aback, maybe even a little 
frustrated that she hadn’t written 
something like “I’m so sorry for your 
loss” or “Let me know if you want to 
talk.” 

Nonetheless, there could have 

been a variety of reasons why she 
didn’t say any of these things. As 
students, we are incredibly busy, so 
we may not have time to respond 
to every e-mail or every text with 
incredible detail. In fact, we shouldn’t 
expect these types of responses all 
the time, and I do not fault her for not 
responding with more than an emoji. 
They are, after all, there for us to use. 
So why wouldn’t we? But this moment 
got me thinking. As technology use 
is rapidly increasing and expanding, 
Facebook stickers, emoticons, emojis 
and GIFs have changed the way we 
communicate, but not necessarily for 
the better.

Ever since the advent of Facebook, 

its users have been clamoring for 
a “dislike” button to pair with the 
“like” button. And though there is no 
indication that feature will be an option 
any time soon, at the end of February 
2016 Facebook gave its users the ability 
to respond to a post on their newsfeed 
by clicking on one of five emoticons. 
The choices? “Love,” “haha,” “sad,” 
“angry” and “wow.” Now, people aren’t 
forced to default to “liking” a post.

According to Facebook CEO Mark 

Zuckerberg, Facebook added the 
emoticons because they want users to 
be able to “express empathy and make 
it comfortable to share a wider range of 
emotions.” Facebook Product Manager 
Sammi Krug said this gives users 
the ability to “authentically react” to 
Facebook posts, adding that this new 
feature is an “easy” thing to do that 
“opens a lot of doors.”

Zuckerberg and Krugs’ statements 

indicate that they see the solution to 
a lack of emotion over Facebook to be 
animated happy and sad faces. Now, 
not only can you “like” something, but 
you can also “love” something. But to 
me, these statements are problematic. 
Don’t get me wrong. I think emoticons 
and emojis have a place in our 
communication. In fact, it would be 
cool if someone were to “love” a picture 
and comment.

I believe an emoticon could be a 

nice supplement to a comment, but it 
shouldn’t replace one — especially if 
the subject is very important or serious. 
We need to think more about how we 
use these emoticons and emojis, as we 
often, too willingly, replace a written 
sentiment with a little animated face 
or GIF.

By adding these emoticons, some 

can express anger about a New York 
Times article regarding the shootings 
in Brussels, for example, by simply 
clicking on the “angry” face emoticon. 
And by making “reacting” this easy, 
I believe we lose truly authentic and 
thought-out written comments.

In this way, we are essentially 

telling people that clicking the “love” 
emoticon is the same thing as typing 
out “I love you” or “This is a great 
article.” Similarly, these emoticons 
also emphasize a one — size — fits — 
all mentality. Take, for example, the 
“wow” emoticon. By clicking that, you 
could be saying, “Wow, that is really 
terrible” or “Wow, this is amazing,” 
which can be problematic given that 
an emoticon can’t easily distinguish 
between the two, unless someone takes 
the time to clarify what it means.

Words allow us to convey different 

levels of emotion that an emoticon 
cannot. If a post pops up on your 
newsfeed about the passing of one of 
your friends’ loved-ones, I am sure it 
could make you sad and you may feel 
inclined to click the “sad” emoticon. 
But then, right after, if a news story 
about the closing of your favorite store 
pops up, that may also make you feel 
sad, but it’s likely a different level of 
sad. What are you going to do then? 
Click the “sad” emoticon?

To me, these events are different 

and elicit two different levels of 
sadness. I would feel odd using the 
“sad” emoticon for both and just 
leaving it at that. It is my belief that 
these emoticons don’t encompass 
all emotions, nor do they always do 
a good job of conveying what we 
actually mean to say without some 
explanation. That is where words 
can and must come in.

Although many see Facebook’s 

newest feature as a blessing, finally a 
way to more accurately express how 
you feel about something, I am wary 
to accept it without reservation. I 
would like to see the written word 
make a comeback. And the best 
way to do that is to give us fewer 
ways to hide behind GIFs, emojis 
and emoticons. Or if you are going 
use emoticon, maybe write a little 
something to go along with it.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

Many voters who have rallied 

behind these two hashtags feel as 
though the candidate affiliated with 
their identified majority party is 
totally unsuitable to be president. 
To this end, these citizens have 
proposed either voting for a third-
party candidate as a protest vote, 
writing in the name of a candidate 
they would have rather endorsed 
or simply staying home on Election 
Day. This impulse is understandable 
given 
how 
unpalatable 
the 

presumptive nominees are to some 
voters. All of these decisions, made in 
protest, if done without considering 
the consequences, all accomplish 
the same thing for our American 
political system: nothing.

A protest vote can serve an 

important 
function 
in 
many 

democracies throughout the world. 
In 
multi-party 
parliamentary 

systems, a protest vote can help close 
the gap between parties and prevent 
a single one from establishing a 

ruling majority. However, because 
the U.S. presidential election only 
has two major primary candidates, 
a protest vote cannot institutionally 
accomplish this goal.

People 
who 
band 
together 

around 
#BernieorBust 
are 
by 

definition averse to compromise. 
This purity can be commendable, 
but compromise is essential to our 
political system. Many people accept 
the importance of bargaining in the 
abstract, but when it comes time 
to actually do so, they fall short. By 
adhering to an unyielding ideaolgy, 
voters spoil elections for themselves. 
One only has to look back to 2000 
to see how a mere 2.7 percent of the 
vote going to Ralph Nader swung the 
results to Bush, who very few Nader 
supporters considered a second 
choice. Thus, it’s important for 
people who have so much trepidation 
about a Clinton or Trump presidency 
to seriously consider what they want 
the country to look like in four years.

There are, however, valid reasons 

to vote for a third party. When a 
third party reaches five percent of 
the popular vote, it receives federal 
funding for the next election cycle. 
Therefore, if you believe that our 
nation can break out of a two — party 
system (despite the sizable obstacle 
presented by our single-member, 
plurality-rule 
election 
system), 

then voting for a third party is a 
worthwhile decision.

Regardless of the way in which 

one ultimately votes, it is important 
to do so while giving serious thought 
to the issues our nation faces. Simply 
writing in a bygone candidate’s name 
is just as bad as sitting home and not 
voting. As you start to consider the 
candidates as the choices become 
clear, consider what your individual 
vote will do. Even when there may 
not seem to be a clear-cut candidate 
for a given party to support, every 
vote counts. Make sure to use yours 
wisely.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have the highest unfavorability ratings of 

any Democrat or Republican nominee ever running for the presidency. This 

phenomenon has a plethora of implications for our democracy, but one of the 

most problematic is the creation of the #NeverTrump campaign and its cousin 

#BernieorBust. #NeverTrump is a rallying call from Republicans, such as Paul 

Ryan, who categorically refuse to support their party’s presumptive nominee 

for any number of reasons: questionable behavior on the campaign trail, general 

bigotry, total lack of a coherent policy platform and serial lying. On the other side, 

there are lingering questions regarding Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, 

passage of the 1994 crime bill, receiving six-digit payments for speeches before 

Goldman Sachs executives and perceived lack of authenticity. All of this stands in 

stark contrast to the ideological purity of her competitor, Bernie Sanders.


UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE AND FACULTY COALITION FOR ETHNIC STUDIES | MICHIGAN IN COLOR

On Monday, April 11, more than 

100 students and faculty members 
gathered 
in 
the 
Michigan 

League for The Future of Ethnic 
Studies, 
a 
teach-in 
organized 

by a broad coalition of graduate 
and undergraduate students at 
the University of Michigan. The 
goals of the event were to develop 
interest and investment in ethnic 
studies across the University and 
to build structures of collaboration 
and coalition among graduate 
students, 
undergraduates 
and 

faculty of color. We organized this 
event to encourage the growth 
of ethnic studies programs and 
demonstrate to the University 
administration that there is a need 
for these units to secure more 
resources, especially in light of 
the University President Mark 
Schlissel’s diversity, equity and 
inclusion initiatives.

Ethnic studies programs across 

the country are experiencing a 
moment of crisis and opportunity. 
We see these crises manifesting 
from 
San 
Francisco 
State 

University, where the first ethnic 
studies programs were founded 
and where the administration is 
threatening devastating cuts to its 
budget, to here at the University of 
Michigan, where the slow attrition 
of faculty of color and ethnic 
studies faculty constitutes its own 
crisis. At the same time, college 
campuses in the past year, from 
Yale to Mizzou, have mobilized 
en masse to make their demands 
for racial justice heard. As the 
University designs its plan for 
diversity, equity and inclusion, we 
need to ensure that the histories, 
cultures and communities that 
make this campus diverse remain 
a central feature of the curriculum.

The event on Monday was the 

product of several years of faculty 
and student activism. This vision 
for this event is shaped by the 
graduate students in the Asian/
Pacific Islander American Studies 
Program in the department of 
American Culture. In the past few 
years, seven faculty members have 
left the A/PIA Studies Program, 
and only two faculty have been 
hired by the department. There 
has been one graduate course 
offered in A/PIA studies since 
2013, and no graduate instructor 
positions for classes in A/PIA 
studies. Undergraduate enrollment 
in the program has also dropped 
dramatically in the last five years. 
However, these problems are not 

unique to A/PIA Studies.

This university does not support 

ethnic studies but asks for our units 
to do the labor of educating a largely 
white and affluent student body of 
issues on race and ethnicity. The 
lack of support for ethnic studies 
is apparent both inside and outside 
the classroom — faculty of color are 
departing this institution in droves; 
graduate students are continuously 
invalidated by their departments 
if their work addresses issues of 
race, gender, sexuality and ability; 
and undergraduates are left to deal 
with a campus climate that allows 
for racist parties to be thrown by 
fraternities and for public spaces to 
be chalked with messages of hate. 
The macro and the micro cannot be 
separated. The lack of institutional 
support for classes that address 
issues of difference and identity 
is reflected in the interactions 
between students and faculty that 
leave people of color fearful and 
tired of every-day acts of racism.

This is not the first time students 

have gathered out of concern for 
ethnic studies. In 2008, graduate 
and 
undergraduate 
students 

organized the Campus Lockdown 
teach-in, 
an 
event 
protesting 

the lack of institutional support 
for recruiting and retaining a 
critical number of faculty in 
ethnic studies, women’s studies 
and other departments. The 400 
attendees of the event brought to 
the University’s attention that only 
three percent of faculty are women 
of color, and many of these few 
faculty were forced to continue 
teaching 
at 
other 
institutions 

because they were not supported 
by the University. The organizers 
of The Future of Ethnic Studies 
teach-in follow the footsteps of 
the 2008 coalition in our push for 
more resources to support faculty 
and students of color at this 
institution.

Our framing around the future of 

ethnic studies is intentional. While 
ethnic studies programs around 
the country are being cut and 
reorganized, our goals are not just 
to defend ethnic studies programs 
from institutional attack, but also 
to push ethnic studies beyond its 
current boundaries to transform 
and grow. Rather than simply 
respond to crises in the University 
by advocating for a return to what 
once was, we can put forward our 
own visions of what ethnic studies 
could be. What would ethnic 
studies look like if we imagined 

different forms of relation beyond 
the “food group” model that keeps 
African 
American, 
Arab 
and 

Muslim American, Asian/Pacific 
Islander American, Latino/a and 
Native American studies in our 
own departments and programs? 
How 
might 
ethnic 
studies 

challenge divisions between the 
classroom and the community 
to cultivate ethical practices of 
community engagement? Or help 
us develop the tools to fight for 
racial, gender and economic justice 
in and beyond the University?

The 
University’s 
plan 
for 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
is a moment of opportunity. 
However, we can’t let the terms 
of this conversation be confined 
and defined by the administration 
as 
a 
push 
for 
multicultural 

inclusion 
rather 
than 
racial 

justice. The current framing of the 
conversation on diversity, equity 
and inclusion is to include more 
people of color without radically 
transforming 
the 
exclusionary 

ways in which this institution is 
already run. As Barbara Ransby 
reminded us during the Speak 
Out for Racial Justice in 2014, 
“If we’re going to embrace the 
notion of diversity, it has to be one 
that is contextualized and that is 
unapologetically political. We can 
have a Baskin-Robbins, pick your 
favorite flavor of diversity, which is 
cosmetic and decorative, or we can 
have a version of diversity that says 
inclusion is based on the history of 
exclusion and oppression.”

What would it mean for us in 

ethnic studies to reframe the 
conversation on diversity, equity 
and inclusion to be a conversation 
about racial justice? In other 
words, how can we call into 
being a university that challenges 
injustice in its own structure and 
in its surrounding communities? 
A university that is responsible to 
Aura Rosser, who was murdered by 
the Ann Arbor Police Department, 
a university that is responsible to 
the residents of Flint, who have 
been abandoned by the state, a 
university that is responsible to 
the surveilled communities in 
Dearborn, a university that is 
responsible to the communities 
whose land this institution is 
built on and a university that 
is responsible to the students, 
faculty, staff and workers upon 
whose 
labor 
this 
institution 

thrives?

The future of ethnic studies

O

ne of my best friends 
on 
campus 
is 
from 

Pennsylvania, and every 

once in a while 
we 
get 
into 

a 
repetitive 

debate 
over 

the 
relative 

importance of the states. In my 
view as a lifelong Michigander, 
the natural beauty and industrial 
prowess of Michigan puts it pretty 
high on my list of notable states. 
However, for my out-of-state 
friend, it usually falls somewhere 
in the bottom half of the states, 
usually 
somewhere 
between 

Delaware and Wisconsin. Even 
though this debate has been 
raging for the entire year, we 
still have our own perceptions 
about the state in which we both 
currently go to school.

The problem with this isn’t that 

my friend and I disagree over the 
ranking of the states. The problem 
comes from our knowledge of 
Michigan. I have spent 19 years 
on this peninsula, and have been 
everywhere from the streets and 
skyscrapers of Detroit to the 
mighty Mackinac Bridge that 
crosses into the Upper Peninsula. 
On the other hand, many non-
Michigan natives drop out of 
the sky at Detroit Metropolitan 
Airport, shoot straight across 
Wayne and Washtenaw Counties 
on I-94, and never — save for an 
occasional trip to the Ypsilanti 
Meijer — leave the city of Ann 
Arbor.

This is a huge problem, as 

it perpetuates many negative 
narratives about Michigan among 
our student body. I’ve heard 
students at the University of 
Michigan criticize every part of 
this state. Be it false statements 
about violence in Detroit or cruel 
jokes about the water crisis in 
Flint, everything seems to be 
on the table for criticism from 
students, many of whom have no 
experience outside of Ann Arbor.

Our university, the University 

of 
Michigan, 
doesn’t 
simply 

bear the name of this great state 
for 
merchandising 
purposes. 

This great academic institution 
was built on the backs of many 
Michiganders spanning all the 
way back to 1817. The tax dollars 
of Michigan residents fund the 
University and have done so for 
almost two centuries. While some 
may argue that the existence of 
high out-of-state tuition rates 
justify 
any 
misunderstanding 

of the University that may exist, 
I hope that any student at this 
school can understand exactly 
what Michigan means. It’s not 
just saying “Go Blue” and hailing 
to the victors, but also knowing 
“Michigan, My Michigan” and 
seeking a pleasant peninsula by 
looking about us.

I hope that students at this 

fine educational institution can 
get the chance and opportunity 
to learn more about the state 
of Michigan in a positive way. 
Whether it’s biking through the 
streets of Detroit, camping on 
the beaches of Lake Michigan or 
even taking a horseback tour of 
Mackinac Island, summer brings 
a lot of chances for students to get 
out of Ann Arbor and into the rest 
of Michigan.

There is a notion that two 

drastically different versions of 
Michigan currently exist. The 
Michigan I know and love is a 
great state, a state that built the 
nation and a state that provides 
for this University. In order for 
us to reconcile my Michigan 
with the notion of a rusted-out 
wasteland, commonly held by 
inexperienced Michiganders, we 
must experience the greatness of 
this state.

So the next time I hear 

someone talking about the Upper 
Peninsula or Detroit in a bad way, 
I’ll challenge them to experience 
Michigan like a true Michigander, 
not just a flyby student.

TV REVIEW

‘Boxes’ resorts 
to tried and true

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

The most played song on my 

iTunes library in 10th grade was 
probably The Goo Goo Dolls’s 
“Slide” 
from 

Dizzy Up the Girl 
in 1998. It was 
the 
song 
that 

first introduced 
me to the band. 
I fell in love 
with the guitar 
rhythm 
that 

felt weightless, 
a 
cascading 

opening melody 
and lyrics that, as cheesy as it 
sounds, hurt to listen to — just the 
way songs do when they ring true.

The Goo Goo Dolls’s latest 

album, Boxes, doesn’t feature 
anything as poignant or tightly 
crafted as some of their previous 
work, but that doesn’t make it any 
less pleasant to listen to. Boxes 
reveals a more mellow side to 
the group. As always, frontman 
John Rzeznik’s voice adds a bit of 
texture to the song’s sentiments 
without pulling focus from the 
song as a whole — which is almost 
always a good thing.

However, the album’s first 

song, “Over and Over,” feels 
bizarrely too young for this 
album and The Goo Goo Dolls 
as a group. It would be the kind 
of fun mindless track you forget 
you’re actually listening to until it 
stops, if it weren’t for the chirpy 
chorus of “Turn it up!” This kind 
of chirpiness works better later on 
in a light, dancing piano melody in 
the song “So Alive.” “Souls in the 
Machine,” which follows it, picks 
up the pace a little bit; it feels like 
the antithesis to something like 
Pink Floyd’s “Brick in the Wall.”

When the chorus of “Flood” 

hits, it’s more gentle than you 

expect, making it much more 
pleasant 
and 
somehow 
more 

subtle, despite its obvious love-
song-like 
quality. 
“The 
Pin” 

and “Boxes” deal with the less 
passionate parts of a love story: 
with the comfort and safety that 
comes with a love that feels like a 
home. The first lyrics of “Free of 
Me” — and the way they’re sung 
in an ever-so-slightly petulant 
tone — sound unusually similar 
to Simple Plan. The next two 
songs, “Reverse” and “Prayer 
in My Pocket” follow suit. The 
beginning of “Lucky One” sounds 
like a mashup between a Taylor 
Swift and a Sam Smith song (I 
promise, it’s true). “Long Way 
Home,” the final song on the 
album, includes a sprightly piano 
sequence, emphatic drum beats 
and a familiar return to home — a 
warm way to round out the album.

Boxes is, more than anything, 

comfortable. 
The 
Goo 
Goo 

Dolls fall back on safe melodies, 
unsurprising beats and lyrics 
that feel like they could have 
come from an Imagine Dragons 
or One Republic album. The 
amount of repetition and the 
similarity of styles to other artists 
in the album stand out. It feels 
slightly been there, done that 
— nothing like the freshness of 
songs like “Slide,” “Iris,” “Black 
Balloon” 
 
or 
dancing-in-the-

rain kind of hits like “Rebel 
Beat” or “Last Hot Night.” The 
sentiments are comfortable and 
comforting in their familiarity, 
but they don’t make me laugh 
or cry or do anything other 
than find comparisons to other 
songs. Nothing sticks with me, 
which is slightly disappointing 
— especially considering that 
“Slide” is probably still within 
the top ten of my iTunes, even 
five years after I’d heard those 
opening four measures.

‘Good’ finale dismays

“Good Wife” finale 

fails to properly honor 

series.

By ALEX INTNER

Summer Managing Arts Editor

“The Good Wife” said goodbye 

after seven seasons with an epi-
sode that didn’t take much time 
to 
celebrate 

the show, its 
characters 
or 
anything 

that made it 
great. Instead, 
for better or 
worse, it put 
the focus on 
closing 
the 

story arc of the 
past 
several 

episodes. To me, that’s a damn 
shame. Over the course of its 
remarkable, yet imperfect seven-
year run, this show built a stable 
of characters who deserved more 
appreciation than a plot-based 
finale like this one allows. The 
finale didn’t do as much as it could 
or should have to show off what 
made “The Good Wife” so fun to 
watch and exciting at its peak.

The main focus of the series 

finale is the conclusion of Peter 
Florrick’s (Chris Noth, “Sex and 
the City”) trial for deliberately 
setting free the son of a major 
donor while he was the Illinois 
State’s Attorney. The trial has 
been ongoing for several episodes, 
and it seems like an odd way to 
spend the final episode. The key 
source of drama is Alicia Florrick 
(Julianna Margulies, “ER”) and 
Diane Lockhart (Christine Baran-
ski, “Chicago”), Peter’s lawyers, 
trying to find some way to present 
new evidence to the jury, think-
ing it might help their case. The 
story meanders along through 
the episode, as writers Robert 
and Michelle King (“In Justice”) 
somehow find a way to add more 
twists than were already done in 
earlier episodes. While it was nice 
to return to the courtroom, there 
wasn’t enough here to justify 
spending a substantial chunk of 
the series finale on a boring, epi-
sodic storyline like this.

Where the finale did look back 

on its run was in its moments 
between Alicia and Will Gardner 
(Josh Charles, “Sports Night”). 

Alicia, questioning whether she 
wants to choose Peter or Jason 
Crouse (Jeffrey Dean Morgan, 
“The Walking Dead”), ends up 
fantasizing conversations with 
her former lover, Gardner. In 
these fantasies she makes realiza-
tions about her case, but she also 
talks to him about their relation-
ship and the law they practiced. 
Until Charles left in the middle of 
the fifth season, Will and Alicia’s 
connection was one of the cor-
nerstones of the show, so to have 
them together again onscreen 
made of a highlight of the episode, 
especially because it allowed the 
finale to actually look back on the 
series’s run.

The oddest choice of the entire 

episode occurs in the final scene, 
where “The Good Wife” ends on a 
moment of bitterness. After Alicia 
stands by her husband through 
his resignation announcement, 
she runs offstage thinking she 
saw Jason in the doorway. It turns 
out not to be him, but as she turns 
to walk back to the stage, Diane 
walks by and slaps her across the 
face for revealing Diane’s hus-
band’s affair in courtroom testi-
mony, and Alicia is left alone. So, 
“The Good Wife” ends with a slap. 
It’s a bitter and angry choice by 
the Kings. Though there’s no need 
to artificially insert a happy end-
ing, at the beginning of the finale, 
Alicia and Diane are at a point of 
mutual respect, trying to build an 
all-female law firm. The episode 
had to work to get the characters 
to a point of tension like this, and 
the legwork just wasn’t there to 
support this final twist.

That kind of artificial charac-

ter work shows what was miss-
ing from this finale, the authentic 
drama that made the series great 
in the first place. When “The 
Good Wife” was at its peak, the 
story twisted and turned in new 
and surprising ways, without ever 
feeling like it was too much or too 
crazy. Each scene flamed with 
tension or crackled with energy 
as the cast members bounced off 
one another. The series would 
always go 10 or 15 minutes before 
cutting to a commerical, often 
using the time to build and build 
to the point where I forgot there 
were even breaks to take. Never 
was this more true than in season 
five. I’m rewatching the opening 
of the episode “Hitting the Fan” 
as I write this, and watching Will 

confront Alicia about her plan to 
leave the firm … the feelings of 
betrayal are palpable. Something 
the finale sorely lacked was this 
dramatic tension, or any kind of 
character-based payoff like “Hit-
ting the Fan” had.

Some of the credit for “The 

Good Wife” remaining so good for 
so long belongs to this fantastic 
ensemble, in which each member, 
from Margulies at the top to guest 
stars at the bottom, crafted well-
rounded characters with poise 
and skill. I will always remember 
the series for taking advantage of 
New York City’s long list of actors, 
bringing in everyone from Broad-
way stars Baranski and Alan Cum-
ming (“Tin Man”) in series regular 
roles, to actors like Martha Plimp-
ton (“Raising Hope”), Michael J. 
Fox (“The Michael J. Fox Show”), 
Carrie Preston (“True Blood”), 
who is probably my favorite of 
the show’s guest stars as Elsbeth 
Tascioni, and David Hyde Pierce 
(“Frasier”). That barely scratches 
the surface of the deep roster of 
talent this series employed. (In 
fact, the finale also pissed me off 
by completely wasting an appear-
ance from “Bunheads” star Sutton 
Foster, who was barely onscreen 
at all).

“The Good Wife” also repre-

sents a faded breed of network 
drama, one that tells a serialized 
story over the course of 22 epi-
sodes. The broadcast business 
model is changing — to the point 
where some shows don’t need to 
reach the traditional 100 hours 
to become successful. In fact, 
Margulies has said that nothing 
would convince her to do another 
22-episodes-per-season network 
drama. For me, there’s still value 
in a show that can maintain its 
story over this many hours, and, if 
the industry goes towards shorter 
seasons as predicted, “The Good 
Wife” will go down in history 
as one of the last carriers of that 
torch.

I may have had problems with 

elements of the final season and 
how “The Good Wife” spent its 
time in the final episode, but I 
will dearly miss the drama. Over 
its seven-year run, it gave the 
television landscape fascinating 
legal cases, beautiful character 
moments and brilliant dramatic 
payoffs that few on network tele-
vision have come close to match-
ing.

Life’s a party: Blind Pig 
celebrates Prince’s music

EVENT REVIEW

Packed party honors 
the life and music of 

late rock star

By ADAM THEISEN

Managing Arts Editor

First of all, I had no idea this 

many people liked Prince. I mean, 
obviously, the outpouring of love 
and grief in the days following 
his death was overwhelming, but 
among people my age, that I actually 
talk to? We had never said much of 
anything about him beyond maybe 
“Kiss.” Prince was one of my mom’s 
favorites, and I really only knew and 
enjoyed him in that context.

But the Blind Pig’s Prince Dance 

Party last Saturday was packed, and 
not just with older folks. It might have 
been as much as 75 percent kids in 
their twenties, with the rest filled out 
by middle-aged fans who were in 
their teens and twenties when Purple 
Rain came out. They were all excited 
and ready to dance.

I don’t quite love Prince enough 

where I can go at it with his music 
for three hours and know every sin-
gle minute, but wow, I don’t know if 
anyone can scale the heights of his 
best songs. Even if I don’t know the 
albums front-to-back, tracks like “I 
Wanna Be Your Lover,” “Controver-
sy” and “Delirious” all killed, effort-
lessly guiding our bodies into sweaty 
frenzies. There was a great moment 
when the DJ spun “When Doves 
Cry” and tossed in the first verse 
to “Little Red Corvette” during an 
instrumental 
break. 
As 
“Doves” 

concluded, it led right into that 0-to-
60 chorus of “Corvette,” blowing up 
the whole room in the process.

Beyond that, “Darling Nikki” and 

“Kiss” were both highlights. The 
former, a song so nasty that it’s the 
reason those “Parental Advisory” 
stickers on CDs exist, was surpris-
ingly easy to dance to, even with its 
slow, grinding tempo. “Kiss,” mean-
while, is the tightest, funkiest, most 
ecstatic three minutes ever put on 
tape, and it caused such a commo-
tion that my friend even hit some-
body in the face during her rush to 
get back to the dancefloor (everyone 
was fine).

Then there was “1999,” for my 

money the best song about party-

ing ever written. Composed during 
peak nuclear anxiety in the early 
’80s, “1999” recasts parties not just 
as mere diversions or excuses to get 
crazy, but rather as the best possible 
response to annihilation. The song 
has a brilliant beat for dancing, but 
it gets its power from the convic-
tion that parties are the natural high 
point of life, not a frivolous distrac-
tion. Given that we were having so 
much fun at the Blind Pig that night, 
“Life is just a party / And parties 
weren’t meant to last,” was a line 
that hung over the whole night.

I left a little too early to hear what 

surely would have been the main 
closers: “Raspberry Beret,” “I Would 
Die 4 U” and, of course, “Let’s Go 
Crazy.” But my night ended on “Pur-
ple Rain,” which was totally fine. It’s 
never been my favorite Prince track, 
but in a room where everyone was a 
little drunk and primed to belt it out, 
it was a beautiful thing. I ended up 
between two middle-aged women 
who were dancing with their hus-
bands but kept reaching over to 
each other and singing together. 
And then one of them ran her hand 
through my sweat-drenched hair.

The night was amazing, but I 

must admit to having some mixed 
feelings about it. It was, essentially, 
a funeral. We were all gathered in 
the room because an artist had died, 
and we all felt this was the best way 
to celebrate and remember his life. 
Is it weird that we were dancing at 
what’s traditionally a somber occa-
sion?

I’ve thought about it a lot, and I 

don’t think so. When Bowie died 
earlier this year, I spent hours 
and hours listening to his music, 
mostly by myself, kind of somberly 
reflecting on who he was and what 

he meant. In retrospect, it felt more 
like dwelling than mourning. I 
honestly didn’t feel like the process 
was complete until I was at a party 
a few months later. “Let’s Dance” 
was on the playlist, which I had 
helped put together, but it ended 
up accidentally being the extended 
dance mix version that’s seven 
minutes long.

Ordinarily, putting on a remix 

like that of an ’80s song would kill a 
party, but that night it was perfect. 
People got up on couches to dance 
and bond and overcome anxiety and 
just do their thing to a great beat, 
even if it was long and unfamiliar. It 
was caused by Bowie, and it was one 
of the highlights of the night. To me, 
that’s now a huge part of his legacy 
— how he brought people together 
with his art, not just because it was 
critically beloved and legendary, but 
also because he got friends cheering 
on other friends dancing on couches 
in a city he never set foot in.

I’ve listened to so much Prince in 

the days since he passed — probably 
more than I ever did when he was 
alive. It has been mostly a private 
experience, but the Blind Pig, I 
think, is where the real truth of 
the artist became clear to me. I 
know nothing about Prince beyond 
the music he gave to the world, so 
there’s no way we can know for 
sure, but I really believe he would’ve 
smiled if he had seen a diverse group 
of Michiganders going non-stop to 
all his songs. Prince never played the 
Blind Pig — I’d be surprised if he’d 
ever even heard of it — but his spirit 
was still in all of our movements. 
Like Bowie’s legacy lives on in those 
couches in that house on Ashley 
Street, Prince will forever be in a 
disco ball on 1st.

Grips falls in 
‘Bottomless Pit’

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Despite having a relatively 

new career, Death Grips has 
already made a significant name 
for 
itself. 
The 

Sacramento trio 
has 
released 

five 
records, 

two 
instrumen-

tal projects, an 
EP and a mix-
tape in the past 
six years, com-
pleting each in 
almost 
rapid 

succession 
and 

occasionally without any prior 
notice to the public. Their music 
has attracted the attention of 
Icelandic singer Björk, Robert 
Pattinson (of “Twilight” fame), 
and even Adidas. Through mix-
ing genres of metal, punk, hip 
hop industrial and electronic, 
Death Grips has become one of 
our generation’s most compelling 
music phenomenons, which is 
strange considering they decid-
ed to call it quits after releasing 
their “final album,” The Powers 
That B, in the spring of 2015.

Of course, that wasn’t the case, 

as they announced late last Octo-
ber that they were embarking 
on a world tour and were in the 
process of creating their newest 
album, Bottomless Pit. Though 
they continue to showcase a tire-
less ambition and impeccable 
craft, it was only a matter of 
time before Death Grips’s music 
became predictable. In addition 
to being the band’s most chaotic 
and harshest record to date, Bot-
tomless Pit lacks the captivating 
hooks, hard-hitting lyrics, cohe-
sive thread and gravity-defying 
heights of their previous efforts.

For a band known for having 

an erratic, experimental sound, 
Death Grips keeps their material 
relatively polished. Yet Bottom-
less Pit feels like an unfortunate 
misstep, with 13 songs piling on 
top of one another and creating a 
numbing, messy listening experi-
ence. Tracks like the heart-stop-
ping opener “Giving Bad People 
Good Ideas,” the unnervingly 
noisy “Spikes” and electro-punk 

thrasher “Three Bedrooms In 
a Good Neighborhood” are irk-
some compared to songs from 
2012’s The Money Store and 
2013’s Government Plates. Like 
their past works, these tracks are 
injected with a nihilistic abandon 
and an abrasive sound, but they 
don’t seem to push hard enough 
to break Death Grips’s thematic 
and sonic mold. Promotional 
single “Hot Head” starts with a 
promising muzzled synth loop, 
which is then gradually drowned 
out in a muddled heap of raucous 
guitar riffs and twitchy electron-
ic blips. “BB Poison” is similarly 
frustrating, building off an irri-
tating warped sample that verges 
on giving a listener a migraine. 
The zany “Bubbles Buried in the 
Jungle” weaves in and out like a 
dangerous driver on the freeway 
as it changes tempos unexpect-
edly twice within the song.

However, Bottomless Pit is 

not without the strengths and 
creative talent of its producers, 
drummer 
Zach 
Hill 
and 

instrumentalist 
Andy 
Morin. 

With frontman Stefan “MC Ride” 
Burnett’s feral roar and stream-
of-consciousness raps, the three 
Death Grips members elevate 
the album’s tired formula on 
certain tracks. Jittery highlights 
“Eh” and “Trash” finds MC Ride 
voicing 
his 
frustrations 
with 

society, 
the 
former 
thrusting 

him in a sea of problems he 
could care less about and the 
latter venting about the negative 
effects 
of 
consumerism. 
The 

album’s shortest song, “Ring a 
Bell,” is also its best, exhibiting 
all of Death Grips’s best qualities 
while 
adding 
a 
shimmering 

guitar riff to boot.

Undoubtedly, 
Death 
Grips 

will continue to perplex, amaze 
and mystify audiences. Though 
Bottomless Pit may not be the 
ideal example of their current 
state as artists, Death Grips 
doesn’t seem to be stopping 
anytime soon — unless the band 
momentarily 
disbands 
again. 

Perhaps if they shift and tweak 
their conceptual focus, Death 
Grips can propel forward into 
much darker, more emotionally 
taut territory.

Updated FDA e-cig 
regulations highlight
University research

Study disproves 

perception of 
e-cigarettes as 
gateway drug

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

E-cigarettes — considered an 

alternative to traditional cigarettes 
since their introduction to the 
market in 2003 — are battery-
powered products which vaporize a 
flavored liquid, which is inhaled by 
the user. E-cigarettes are sometimes 
used as tools to quit smoking. 

According to a 2014 survey by 

the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, nearly 22 percent 
of adults ages 18 to 24 had tried an 
e-cigarette, and about four percent 
of adults used e-cigarettes every 
day or some days.

The 
rising 
popularity 
of 

e-cigarettes has raised concern 
as to how e-cigarettes would be 
regulated 
and 
marketed, 
and 

whether they would be treated the 
same as traditional cigarettes with 
regard to public policy — despite 
minimal research conducted on the 
health effects of e-cigarettes. 

For example, despite popular 

belief, e-cigarettes contain many 
of 
the 
ingredients 
traditional 

cigarettes do, such as nicotine, 
unknown chemicals, flavorings 
and colorings.

A previous University study 

indicated 
that 
both 
teenage 

e-cigarette users and their parents 
wish to see e-cigarette regulation 
in public places, another concern 
that accompanies the product.

Last Thursday, the Food and 

Drug Administration announced 
that it will regulate e-cigarettes 
and other products — such as cigars 
and hookahs — in the same way it 
regulates traditional cigarettes and 
tobacco.

According to the announcement 

made Thursday by Secretary of 
Health and Human Services Sylvia 
Burwell and FDA commissioner 
Robert Califf, restrictions will be 
placed on the sale and distribution 
of e-cigarettes and other tobacco 

products, including age restrictions 
and advertising and promotion 
restrictions 
for 
public 
health 

purposes. 

Sarah 
Cherng, 
a 
Rackham 

student and lead author of the 
University study, agreed that there 
is a large debate surrounding the 
potential harms and benefits of 
e-cigarettes.

“We’re seeing a very large 

increase in high schoolers and 
adolescents 
using 
electronic 

cigarettes,” Cherng said. “On one 
hand, there are people who are 
very concerned that electronic 
cigarettes are going to act as a 
gateway to traditional smoking 
initiation. Whereas, on the other 
hand, there is the harm reduction 
type research … (which believes) 
e-cigarettes can actually help with 
smoking cessation — help current 
smokers stop smoking.”

The researchers used data from 

resources such as the National 
Health Interview and the CDC 
showing previous and current 
national rates of smoking, as well 
as statistics on the growth rate of 
e-cigarette usage, to come up with 
a simulation model.

Cherng said the researchers 

wanted to perform a quantitative 
analysis to see whether e-cigarettes 
act as a gateway to smoking 
initiation or as an aid for current 
smokers who need to quit.

There has so far been few studies 

looking into the health differences 
of using a traditional cigarette 
and an e-cigarette, as well as little 
research on the long-term effects 
of using e-cigarettes as a cessation 
device.

According to the University 

study, a 20 percent increase in the 
rate of smoking cessation would 
correlate to a six percent reduction 
in overall smoking popluation by 
the year 2060. On the contrary, for 
smoking rates to increase by six 
percent in 2060, smoking initiation 
would have to increase by 200 
percent — an unlikely occurrence, 
according to the researchers.

“Based on the patterning of 

e-cigarette 
use 
among 
adults 

right now … their use is primarily 
concentrated 
among 
current

smokers,” 
Cherng 
said. 
“Any 

potential effects that e-cigarettes 
have on smoking initiation or 
the overall smoking prevalence 
in the United States is going to 
have a much smaller effect than 
if e-cigarettes have an effect on 
smoking cessation or an increased 
smoking cessation because we have 
so many more current smokers 
using e-cigarettes.”

Consistent 
with 
the 
team’s 

finding, 
statistics 
from 
the 

American Lung Association show 
that 76.8 percent of people who 
recently used e-cigarettes in 2013 
also were traditional cigarette 
smokers.

Cherng said further research is 

imperative for future debates and 
policymaking about e-cigarettes.

“Because the evidence is so scant 

right now about whether or not 
they actually do increase smoking 
initiation among never-smokers 
versus their effect on cessation, in 
terms of the policy implications, 
it’s important to contextualize 
that in e-cigarette regulation,” 
Cherng said, adding: “if we can 
start focusing people towards the 
potential benefits of e-cigarettes 
and also enact legislation that helps 
prevent young kids from using 
them, then what we expect is that 
there is a potential of a huge benefit 
resulting from e-cigarette use if 
they increase cessation.” 

Paula Lantz, associate dean for 

research and policy engagement, 
echoed Cherng’s statements and 

said in an email interview that there 
is merit to the argument that too 
much regulation for e-cigarettes 
could be detrimental.

“(Many) are concerned that 

the FDA might “over-regulate” 
e-cigarettes, in that it will make it 
harder for e-cigarettes to be used 
as a harm reduction approach or 
smoking cessation tool for current 
smokers,” 
Lantz 
said. 
“While 

much more research is needed...
the 
Cherng 
simulation 
model 

forecasts demonstrate quite clearly 
that, under any reasonable set of 
assumptions, the harm reduction 
and 
smoking 
cessation 
gains 

will significantly outweigh any 
increase in youth smoking due to 
e-cigarettes. This supports the 
concerns 
that 
over-regulating 

e-cigarettes will be bad for public 
health.”

depressive symptoms over time 
unless they are Black men.”

However, these findings do 

not suggest Black men do not 
know how to use their education, 
Assari said. On the contrary, 
for Black men, each year of 
education increasingly protects 
the population from engaging 
in risky behavioral patterns. 
Rather, it is the persistent 
societal segregation and social 
barriers present an increase in 
the risk of depressive symptoms 
for Black men, according to 
Assari. 
He 
explained 
that 

negative social barriers lead to a 
restricted access to jobs and an 
unequal pay, both of which lead 
to the potential development of 
depressive symptoms. 

“There is this intersection of 

gender and race which works as 
a huge barrier in this country, 
not only just race,” Assari said.

Assari said these findings 

raise the question as to whether 
this research is something new, 
or whether society has known 
and allowed this to occur.

“We knew discrimination and 

racism exist, and we knew that 
education doesn’t benefit to the 
same level to the Blacks but, to 
my understanding, that we never 
knew— that it may increase risk 
of depression,” Assari said.

Ultimately, 
Assari 
hopes 

public policy can be altered 
to eliminate social barriers. 
In the mean time, he hopes 
that clinicians, while treating 
Black males, keep in mind the 
correlation between depressive 
symptoms and an elevation in 
education level.

Ford, a University alum — although 
it is housed in Joan and Sanford 
Weill Hall.

“It’s still the Ford School, named 

after one of our most cherished 
alumni, but the building is named 
after two donors who helped us 
realize the vision for the new 
facility,” Schlissel wrote. “In both 
the Ford and Trotter cases, the 
donors shared U-M’s vision for what 
their gifts could do for our campus.”

Schlissel also referenced an April 

29 meeting between himself, E. 
Royster Harper, the University’s 
vice president for student life, and 
representatives from the Black 

Student 
Union, 
which 
initially 

called for the relocation of Trotter 
two years ago with the #BBUM 
campaign — a viral public discussion 
on the experiences of Black students 
— and has been at the forefront 
of advocating for the center’s 
new central campus location and 
therefore increased accessibility. 

BSU programming chair Jamie 

Thompson, an LSA junior, voiced 
disapproval of the new building’s 
name in an e-mail interview with the 
Daily last week. Thompson wrote 
that, although she understands 
the 
Multicultural 
Center 
itself 

will retain Trotter’s name, she still 
disagrees with it being housed in a 
facility named after Bernstein and 
his wife. 

“Black students have fought for 

the last 40 plus years to provide a 
space on our campus for ourselves 
and for the promotion of diversity 
on our campus,” Thompson wrote. 
“What will it mean for students, and 
students to come, to see building 
after building all named after white 
men? At the end of the day, the 
University will operate as a business 
— caring more about monetary gifts 
than the feelings of its students and 
alumni.”

Thompson 
also 
criticized 

Schlissel’s Ford School/Weill Hall 
analogy, pointing out the inherent 
differences 
between 
the 
two 

buildings in a public Facebook post.

“Unlike the Ford School of Public 

Policy, Trotter is not a college,” 
Thompson wrote. “Trotter stands 
outside of the academic realm and 

serves as a social setting for students 
... It serves as an environment for 
students of color to have a space of 
their own.”

The 
University 
emphasized 

Bernstein and Bendit’s history of 
civil rights advocacy, highlighting 
the couple’s work with groups 
including 
the 
American 
Civil 

Liberties 
Union, 
the 
Michigan 

Civil Rights Commission as well 
as a number of Jewish community 
service organizations at the April 21 
Board of Regents meeting.

Regent Bernstein applauded the 

role of student activists in securing 
the multicultural center’s relocation 
in a press release. 

“Rachel and I are honored 

to support the legacy of all who 
have advanced the enriching and 

empowering mission of Trotter 
since its founding — the generations 
of U-M students who have been 
activists for diversity, and the 
current 
U-M 
students 
whose 

advocacy helped guide the vision for 
this new building,” Bernstein said 
in the statement. “Their movement 
inspires our gift.”

The bullpen catcher, the ‘mom’ and the sliding specialist

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

Seven games this season, fans of 
the Michigan softball team received 
cardboard cutouts of a senior 
Wolverine. It is a day to honor 
the player and her contributions 
to her team. They are shown on 
the scoreboard, applauded during 
introductions and cheered on by 
the crowd.
For the four senior starters, it is 
a day of extra incentive. All eyes in 
the stands look for a towering home 
run or dazzling strike out.
But while Michigan’s senior 
bullpen catcher didn’t get to see the 
field on the day named after her, 
Lauren Connell wasn’t upset.
She knew her role. In fact, every 
Wolverine has a role.
For most players, the roles are 
typical. Get on base. Lay down a 
sacrifice bunt. Throw strikes. Get 
ahead in the count.
But a group of three seniors 
fulfill 
three 
roles 
not 
always 
present 
during 
gameplay. 
One 
brings humor and constructive 
criticism to her pitchers. Another 
dedicates herself to her teammates, 
focusing on solving their problems 
and helping with their needs. The 
third pushes herself and her fellow 
pinch-runners to succeed in crucial 
moments.
Connell arrived at Michigan four 
years ago after a record-setting 
high school career. Four years later, 
she’s finishing up her fourth year 
as the team’s bullpen catcher, a 
position that Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins calls the most challenging 
role on the team.
Olivia Richvalsky has tallied just 
two hits in her time as a Wolverine. 
Still, her role transcends that of the 
traditional outfielder, as players 
call the constant pinch-runner the 
“team mother,” who never shies 
away from offering a helping hand.
Mary Sbonek dreamt of playing 
for the Michigan softball team 
for years. Once she arrived in Ann 
Arbor, she tried out and eventually 
earned a spot as a pinch-runner. 
Now, she prepares the younger 
pinch-runners for the future.
“You’re not going to have all 
Sierra Romeros,” Hutchins said 
about the All-American senior 
second baseman. “You’ve gotta 
have different types of roles.”
Last weekend, the three seniors 
played at Alumni Field for the last 
time in their Big Ten careers. In the 
final inning, Hutchins substituted 

Connell, Richvalsky and Sbonek — 
as a pinch runner — in the game. 
During the final moments of the 
regular season, the three received 
their chance to shine. Last Saturday, 
Richvalsky caught the final out of 
the game to cement Michigan’s 
regular season conference title. It 
was her first putout of the season.
And now, beginning with this 

weekend’s Big Ten tournament, 
the three players will participate in 
their fourth consecutive postseason 
with 
aspirations 
of 
one 
final 
Women’s College World Series 
appearance.
This is the story of three seniors 
who perform different types of 
roles. This is the story of a bullpen 
catcher, a “team mom,” and a sliding 
specialist.
 ***
The bullpen catcher:
Lauren 
Connell 
had 
a 
distinguished high school career 
for West Lafayette (IN), starting 
all four years, serving as a team 
captain in her senior season and 
playing both catcher and third base.
During her first visit to the 
University, Connell fell in love 
with Ann Arbor’s atmosphere and 
the familiar midwest lifestyle. 
She learned that Michigan sought 
a bullpen catcher, and though it 
would bring fewer moments at 
the backstop for Connell, it was a 
chance she couldn’t pass up.
“The opportunity to play for 
such an incredible team, with such 
a great reputation — this is a team 
that’s still playing in June — that’s 
what I (wanted) to do,” Connell said. 
“As soon as I stepped on campus, I 
knew that this was where I wanted 
to spend the next four years of my 
life.”
Now in her senior season, 
Connell has fully embraced her role 

as the bullpen catcher. She loves 
spending time with pitchers and 
mentoring them.
It wasn’t always like that, though, 
especially for a player who led her 
high school in career home runs 
and runs scored.
“Going from one of the main 
players on the team to a bullpen role 
was a little bit different,” Connell 

said. “Contributing in a different 
way than what I was used to, it was 
a transition, and it’s been a role that 
I’ve really accepted and I think I’ve 
done well in.”
The Wolverines’ pitchers agree 
with her. Fifth-year senior right-
hander Sara Driesenga has spent 
nearly her entire Michigan career 
throwing to Connell, who she says 
isn’t afraid to tell the pitching staff 
if they aren’t hitting the zone, or if a 
particular motion isn’t flowing well.
“(Connell) sees the changes in 
how we’ve (the pitchers) gotten 
better,” 
Driesenga 
said. 
“She 
expects us to hit our spots and do 
all these things which maybe we 
struggled with more a couple years 
ago.”
The Wolverines’ roster lists 
Connell as a catcher. She crouches 
during practices, catches pitches 
and warms up starters during 
games. 
But 
because 
of 
her 
daily interactions and constant 
mentoring, 
Connell 
sees 
it 
differently.
“I almost consider myself a 
part of the pitching staff,” Connell 
said. “I think their successes, I 
like to take part in them as well … 
Especially when our pitchers have 
been doing so well over the past four 
years. I really feel like I’ve played a 
part in that.”
For others on the team, Connell’s 
most important asset may be her 
humor. Since she seldom sees 

opportunities in games, Connell 
has found ways to contribute from 
the dugout.
Connell, Richvalsky and Sbonek 
each emphasized the importance 
of the Michigan softball sisterhood. 
Hutchins frequently speaks about 
the role of each Wolverine. It is up 
to each player to simply ‘do her part’ 
for Michigan.
Connell’s 
part 
oftentimes 
involves telling jokes that can make 
even the most serious on the team 
crack a smile.
“Michigan softball… we do well 
and we have fun,” Connell said. 
“Not silly, goofy fun, but just having 
fun and all being together. It’s kinda 
weird thinking of being funny as a 
role on the softball team, but I think 
it helps us just stay in the moment 
and help us not worry about other 
things.”
Romero, who met Connell at 
freshmen orientation, remembers 
her humor from that first encounter.
“She was hilarious, right from 
the get-go,” Romero said. “You can 
even ask Hutch.
“Some of the things that come out 
of her mouth, you’re like … ‘How’d 
you even think of that?’ ”
The humor aspect of Connell’s 
role may be the most enjoyable 
and perhaps the easiest. What she 
finds most challenging, however, is 
separating the relationships built 
with her pitching staff off the field 
with her job as the bullpen catcher.
“Sometimes, the pitchers need 
someone to say ‘Hey, you need to do 
better at this, that’s not good enough 
right now,’ ” Connell said. “So it’s 
kind of difficult for me sometimes 
to come out of my role as a friend, 
and really hold them accountable.”
When asked about her favorite 
experience throughout her four-
year career, Connell paused for a 
moment. While Connell did not see 
the field in Game 2 of last season’s 
Women’s College World Series, 
she relished her team’s comeback 
win — even if she didn’t directly 
contribute to it.
“It was so fun to just see our team 
will ourselves to victory,” Connell 
said. “(To) force Game 3, playing 
in that moment was such a ‘pinch 
me’ moment for all of us. We were 
literally living our dreams.”
 ***
The ‘Mom’:
During games, Olivia Richvalsky 
can be seen on the basepaths, 
organizing cheers or mentoring 
Michigan’s freshmen.
Richvalsky loves working with 

the new players upon their arrival 
in Ann Arbor. Whether it is during 
practice or a game, she loves hearing 
their questions and assisting them 
with challenges they confront. She 
invites them to team meals and 
other team-wide events.
“I’ll cheer for them like a mom 
would,” 
Richvalsky 
said. 
“I’ll 
make signs. I truly share in (their) 
success.”
Richvalsky spoke of meeting with 
her two co-captains — Romero and 
junior outfielder Kelly Christner — 
to delegate responsibilities. Because 
Romero and Christner are often on 
the field during games and giving 
team-wide orders during practice, 
it is up to Richvalsky to connect on 
a more individual-based level with 
the players.
“Kelly and I might not be so 
easy on some people so we’ll yell 
something at them, and they might 
get a little upset,” Romero said. 
“And we’ll say, ‘Liv, we need you to 
go calm them down, we just yelled 
at them.’ ”
Richvalsky added: “Sometimes 
Kelly can really get onto someone, 
and I can come back and say ‘Hey, 
do you know why Kelly said that? 
Do you know why that instruction 
makes sense here?’ (I try to) make 
sure that everyone understands 
why things are how they are.”
Richvalsky displayed tremendous 
resilience in coming back from a 
leg injury and multiple surgeries. 
Through 
an 
intense 
year-long 
rehabilitation process in which she 
faced both physical, she tirelessly 
pushed to return and to contribute. 
She constantly participates in extra 
work on the basepaths to prepare 
herself for game day opportunities.
“Any opportunity that I have out 
there is so much more rewarding 
because of what I went through,” 
Richvalsky said. “It still drives 
me to work out on off days, go the 
extra mile to continue to get better 
because nothing is ever enough.”
Her 
determination 
stemmed 
from her love for her fellow 
Wolverines, 
missing 
them 
tremendously during her absence.
And while she acknowledges 
her role as the team’s “mom,” she 
reiterated the sisterhood concept 
explained by Connell.
“I look at those girls like my 
little sisters,” Richvalsky said. “I 
wouldn’t want them to feel like 
anything other than family.”
While 
her 
tenacity 
and 
persistence are certainly admirable,

perhaps 
most 
important 
is 
the 
maternal 
atmosphere 
that 
Richvalsky brings to the Wolverines. 
She even devotes herself to securing 
a ride home for every player.
In order to promote team-wide 
harmony, Richvalsky strives to 
recognize each player’s learning 
style. It is her goal to ease the 
freshmen 
transition 
and 
she 
constantly offers comfort.
“Liv is kind of like the mom,” 
Romero said. “She keeps everything 
and everyone under control.”
“I worry about these girls,” 
Richvalsky said. “I want their 
success more than my own. More 
than anything else, I want the 
team’s success. (I want) each of the 
individual girls to achieve their own 
goals.”

The sliding specialist:
When Mary Sbonek first arrived 
at Michigan in the fall of 2012, she 
aimed to fulfill her life-long dream 
of playing for the Wolverines. After 
playing travel-ball in high school, 
she felt she should at least try out.
Hutchins heard of Sbonek from 
a cousin who knew one of Sbonek’s 
relatives, who had mentioned her 
speed on the basepaths. Sbonek first 
participated in a separate workout 
away from the team.
Then, she spent two weeks 
working with Michigan’s players, 
as a trial period of sorts. These two 
weeks were filled with uncertainty 
as Sbonek was unsure of her fate.
“That 
was 
nerve-racking,” 
Sbonek recalled. “I was still kind of 
trying to make the team.”
But after some time had passed, 
Hutchins pulled her aside and told 
her she had made it. After weeks 
of hard work and anxiousness, her 
dream had been realized: she was 

finally a Wolverine.
Michigan’s 
players 
ensured 
that she would have no trouble 
integrating 
with 
her 
new 
teammates, quickly welcoming her.
”Once you’re on the team, I don’t 
view anyone differently, if they are 
a walk-on,” Driesenga said. “All of 
us are equal members of the team.”
Added Romero: “We’re one big 
family, and right away, we let them 
know whenever we’re going out to 
eat. Whenever we’re going to go 
do something as a team, they’re 
brought in right away.”
As 
a 
veteran 
pinch-runner, 
Sbonek works with sophomore 
outfielder Nikki Wald, who will be 
the first off the bench once Sbonek 
and Richvalsky depart. The drills in 
practice — often running back and 
forth during a game-like simulation 
— and open communication have 
allowed Sbonek and Wald to forge 
a teacher-to-student connection. 
This bond leads to greater support 
during the moments when Hutchins 
will call their names and insert 
them on the basepaths.
One thing Wald may have 
difficulty picking up from her 
mentor is Sbonek’s unique slide at 
home. It perplexes even a three-
time All-American.

“She slides but then turns over, 
swipes it with her back hand and it’s 
a spin move, so that way the catcher 
can’t tag her,” Romero said. “I could 
never do that in a million years. I 
don’t know how she does that.”
Because Sbonek is often the first 
pinch-runner off the bench, she is 

also first runner to gauge the arms 
of the outfielders and the accuracy 
of the catcher.
It can be tiring to pinch-run. 
Practices often consist of time 
spent on the basepaths waiting 
for commands from the coaching 
staff. They provide tremendous 
assistance 
as 
the 
baserunners 
during defensive drills. And besides 
pinch-running preparation, they 
still need to do hitting and fielding 
drills with the other members of the 
team.
Sbonek loves the role she won 
after a tryout years ago and hopes to 
have memories as enjoyable as last 
year’s World Series experience.
“(I love) being able to score the 
runs,” Sbonek said. “I can go faster 
on the basepaths for my team than 
the person who is there. That’s why 
I’m there. So if I can come in and 
score a run, that’s great.”
 ***
As three of the oldest players on 
the team, it is Connell, Richvalsky 
and Sbonek’s job to organize cheers 
in the dugout while Michigan is on 
the field.
The cheers provide another 
chance for these three role players 
to add to Michigan’s success.
“Liv, Mary and I do a great job of 
keeping everyone who’s not in the 
game, cheering for the people on 
the field,” Connell said. “When the 
people come off the field and when 
we’re at bat, to (try) get as loud and 
crazy as possible.”
And while the on-field players 
focus on the pitcher in the circle 
or the batter at the plate, they still 
recognize the support of their 
teammates.
“When I’m at second base, and 
they do one of their cheers, or when 
the pitcher gets a strikeout, I see 
them getting into it,” Romero said. 

“(The cheers) are nice because they 
take away that stress.”
Each of the 24 Wolverines are 
expected to arrive at practice with 
a desire to perform their specific 
duty. 
Hutchins fills her Michigan 
roster with specialists. While many 
pitchers nationwide are versatile 
— starting on offense and in the 
circle — Driesenga and junior right-
hander Megan Betsa have yet to 
bat this season. Up and down the 
lineup, certain players are expected 
to hit for power, while others like 
junior shortstop Abby Ramirez are 
expected to focus on getting on 
base.
Brandi 
Virgil 
came 
before 
Richvalsky and Sbonek, playing 
from 2010-2014. She served as a 
pinch runner for her four years, 
and once she departed, Sbonek 
and Richvalsky took her spot as 
the lead pinch-runners. The two 
work with Wald, who will anchor 
the pinch- running corps next 
year. Former bullpen catcher Becca 
Garfinkel, who graduated last year, 
caught pitches alongside Connell 
throughout her career. This year, 
Connell crouches in the bullpen 
next to sophomore Morgan Swift, 
who looks to take over the reins 
next season.
It is a cycle of specialists that 
will continue, even after Connell, 
Richvalsky and Sbonek finish their 
Michigan careers. Just like the 
graduating members of the starting 
nine, the pinch-runners and bullpen 
catcher will be replaced next season. 
They won’t be filled by a player as 
clever and humorous as Connell, 
or as motherly as Richvalsky or as 
caring and motivated as Sbonek.
Instead, the players will embrace 
these duties with their own unique 
qualities, 
and 
add 
their 
own 

characteristics to them, just as 
Connell, Richvalsky and Sbonek 
did.
 ***

Lauren Connell probably won’t 
hit the walk-off home run to send 
Michigan to the WCWS. But she 
will spend hours preparing and 
laughing 
with 
Driesenga 
and 
Betsa in the bullpen during the 
postseason.
Olivia 
Richvalsky 
may 
not 
receive the opportunity to bat with 
the bases loaded and the game on 
the line. Whoever does receive 
the 
opportunity 
will 
certainly 
be comforted and prepared by 
Richvalsky, whether it be a fellow 
senior or an anxious freshman.
Mary 
Sbonek 
will 
see 
opportunities on the basepaths in 
the upcoming Big Ten Tournament. 
And while these moments on the 
field may be brief, she strives to 
make the most of them, and perhaps 
will utilize her unique slide.
The three will be fulfilling the 
roles established by Hutchins. And 
they will strive for success.
“They don’t get a whole lot of 
opportunity, but they understand 
the importance of their role,” 
Hutchins said. “They are great role 
models for the kids behind them 
that will end up becoming role 
players.”

Wolverines receive awards

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

The No. 2 Michigan softball 
team was well represented when 
the Big Ten Conference released 
its 2016 all-conference teams 
and announced the recipients 
of its four individual awards 
Wednesday.
Four 
Wolverines 
were 
nominated to the All-Big Ten First 
Team, four were named to the All-
Big Ten Second Team and three 
claimed an award of their own: 
senior second baseman Sierra 
Romero was named Big Ten Player 
of the Year, junior right-hander 
Megan Betsa won Big Ten Pitcher 
of the Year and coach Carol 
Hutchins was announced as the 
Big Ten Coach of the Year.
Romero, who won the award her 
freshman and sophomore years, 
has enjoyed a productive season 
both at the plate and in the field. 
She is hitting .488 this season with 
16 home runs and 71 runs batted-
in. With a .963 fielding percentage, 
Romero has commited just five 
errors while tallying 58 putouts and 
72 assists. This season, she has been 
honored as both the Big Ten Player 
of the Week and National Player of 
the Week, and is also a finalist for 
the Collegiate Player of the Year.
For Betsa, this marks the 
second consecutive year she has 
been named Big Ten Pitcher of 
the Year. The right-hander is 22-3 
with a 2.05 earned-run average, 
and she is also averaging the most 
strikeouts per seven innings in the 
nation with 11.8.

Hutchins’s 
nomination 
is 
the 16th of her storied career as 
Michigan’s head coach, and it 
comes during a season in which 
expectations were perhaps the 
highest they have ever been in Ann 
Arbor. The Wolverines returned 
most of their team from last 
season, which ended with a loss 
in Game 3 of the Women’s College 
World Series against No. 1 Florida.
But Hutchins has kept her team 
grounded all year, and even after a 
few early season losses, Michigan 
is playing like a championship 
contender. Michigan — which won 
the conference title for the ninth 
consecutive season — is currently 
on a 17-game winning streak and is 
poised to host an NCAA Regional 
as it enters the postseason.
Romero and Betsa were joined 
on the All-Big Ten First Team 
by senior center fielder Sierra 
Lawrence and senior right fielder 
Kelsey Susalla.
Lawrence, who has been named 
a finalist for Collegiate Player 
of the Year along with Romero, 
has been a steady presence atop 
the order for the Wolverines 
and boasts a batting average and 
on-base percentage both well 
above .400 alongside 10 home runs 
and 40 RBI.
Susalla’s nomination is the first 
of her career, and comes during a 
season in which she is hitting .364 
with 10 homers and 50 RBI. She 
has been a reliable hitter for the 
Wolverines in the middle of the 
lineup, having hit at both the No. 3 
and cleanup spots this season.
Meanwhile, sophomore first 

baseman Tera Blanco, sophomore 
catcher Aidan Falk, junior third 
baseman Lindsay Montemarano 
and 
fifth-year 
right-hander 
Sara Driesenga were tabbed as 
members of the second team.
Blanco, 
who 
has 
pitched 
occasionally, has had a breakout 
season at the plate, hitting .415 
with 10 home runs and 57 RBI. At 
first base, Blanco hasn’t made an 
error all year.
Falk has been steady behind the 
plate for her team after winning 
the starting job at catcher near 
the midway point of the season. 
She is hitting .321 with five home 
runs and 32 RBI.
In addition to the second team 
nomination, Montemarano was 
also named to the Big Ten All-
Defensive Team for her efforts 
manning the hot corner. In 
addition to her defense, the junior 
third baseman has also provided 
the Wolverines with some pop in 
her bat, slugging eight home runs 
among 16 extra-base hits.
After missing most of last 
season due to injury, Driesenga has 
come back strong in her final year 
to provide her team with a potent 
1-2 starting rotation. She boasts a 
gaudy 20-0 win-loss record, while 
also carrying a 2.26 ERA.
Michigan begins postseason 
play Friday at the Big Ten 
Tournament, as the Wolverines 
continue their journey back to 
Oklahoma City.
And the number of accolades 
earned Wednesday show just why 
Michigan is heavily favored to do 
so. 

‘M’ upset by CMU

Michigan comeback 
attempt falls short 
in 8-7 defeat

By ETHAN WOLFE

Summer Managing Sports Editor

After a 39-run outburst in its 
three-game sweep of Rutgers last 
weekend, the No. 19 Michigan 
baseball team looked poised to 
continue its momentum against 
Central Michigan — a bottom-
feeder in the Mid-American 
Conference.
But 
the 
Chippewas had 
other plans.
For the first 
six innings of 
Wednesday’s 
game, 
Central 
Michigan (8-10 
Mid-American 
Conference, 
16-33 
overall) 
dominated 
the 
Wolverines 
(12-5 Big Ten, 34-13), and hung 
on by a thread to secure an 8-7 
victory.
Through six frames, Central 
Michigan pitchers Dazon Cole 
and Colton Bradley combined to 
no-hit Michigan. Even with four 
walked batters and five batters 
hit-by-pitch, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
offense failed to make good 
contact at the plate until the 
seventh.
“You 
can’t 
take 
anyone 
lightly,” said Michigan coach 
Erik 
Bakich. 
“You 
have 
to 
run your fastest 
race no matter 
who 
you’re 
racing against. 
This 
was 
a 
humbling day.”
Michigan 
couldn’t 
find 
its way on the 
mound for most of the contest 
either.
In the Wolverines’ previous 
meeting March 29 — a 9-7 win 
that saw a late rally by the 
Chippewas — Central Michigan 
batters used a slew of early-
inning singles, a double and two 
wild pitches to tag Michigan 
pitchers for eight runs.
Wednesday, 
freshman 
left-
hander Will Tribucher, who 

tossed six innings of one-hit 
scoreless 
baseball 
against 
Eastern Michigan in his previous 
start, lasted just 2.1 innings and 
allowed five runs.
Down 8-1 heading into the 
seventh inning, the Wolverines 
chances at winning looked bleak.
But two walks and a single 
loaded the bases for freshman 
third baseman Jimmy Kerr, who 
was substituted into the game for 
fifth-year senior left fielder Matt 
Ramsay in the fifth. Kerr took 
advantage of the opportunity 
with a bases-clearing double to 
dig into the Chippewas’ lead, 
8-4. A sacrifice 
fly 
from 
junior catcher 
Harrison 
Wenson added 
another run for 
the Wolverines.
The following 
inning, a single 
by sophomore 
shortstop Jake 
Bivens and a 
fielder’s choice 
off the bat of Kerr scored two 
more runs to make it a one-run 
game.
“When you have runners on, 
you have to move up them up or 
do what you have to do to get 
them in,” Bakich said. “Jimmy 
was a great example of that. 
Coming off the bench to get four 
RBIs … that’s hard to do.”
In 
the 
ninth, 
Michigan 
got two runners on base, but 
three strikeouts stopped the 
Wolverines from scoring, and 
Central 
Michigan 
secured 
the 
win.
“There’s no 
moral victories 
for making it 
close,” Bakich 
said. “We had 
some 
scoring 
opportunities 
that we missed in those early 
innings, and we wouldn’t have 
been in this position if we took 
advantage of those.”
Being a non-conference game, 
the loss did not hurt Michigan’s 
chances in pursuing its first 
Big Ten title since 2008. But 
to accomplish this feat, it must 
prove that it can take care 
of 
business 
against 
weaker 
opponents.
