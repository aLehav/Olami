Union debuts Au Bon Pain

Cafe chain fills
former home of
University Club
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily NewsoEditor
Early morningstudiers rejoice
there's a new bakery in town.
After months of renovations,
the Au Bon Pain cafe and bakery
opened Tuesday on the first floor
of the Michigan Union. Dur-
ing its opening, the cafe served
ready and custom-made sand-
wiches, salads and bakery items
to a small crowd of students and

Ann Arbor residents.
Michigan Union director
Susan Pile said she was pleased
with the opening day turnout,
considering Tuesday's sub-zero
temperatures and not all stu-
dentshad moved back to campus.
A student-centered opening day
with free samples and perfor-
mances will welcome more stu-
dents on Jan.16.
Au Bon Pain replaces the
University Club, which opened
in 1937 and closed this sum-
mer. Renovations, which began
in late August and ended at the
end of the Fall 2013 semester,
were conducted to maintain the
Union's heritage while updating

.the space for modern students,
Pile said.
Pile added that the Univer-
sity took care to ensure the new
restaurant preserved the space's
character, including the Univer-
sity Club's original entry arch
and flooring.
"We were really intentional in
working with the arch of Au Bon
Pain that we didn't want to take
just their cookie cutter operation
and put it here at Michigan," Pile
said.
To keep the space University
focused, student photography of
the campus is also featured in
the restaurant.
Seating is in a room adjacent

to the serving area and includes
between booths, group seating
and couches. This seating struc-
ture allows Au Bon Pain to be
used as a study and gathering
space for students.
"They heard us in honor-
ing what is the Michigan Union
and what is the tradition here,
but updating it to make it more
usable for student needs today,"
Pile said.
Laura Seagram, marketing
and communications special-
ist for the Union, said the space
can accommodate a stage and be
used for poetry slams, a capella
shows and other student events.

After notorious
2009 run, swine
flu hits hard again
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily News Editor
Twelve patients at the Uni-
versity Hospital are receiving
treatment in the intensive care
unit after contracting the HINT
influenza virus - the same
strain seen in the 2009 "swine
flu" pandemic.
Dr. Sandro Cinti, professor
of infectious diseases, said sev-
eral of the patients have been
placed on an advanced form of
life support known as ECMO -
extracorporeal membrane oxy-
genation. While the procedure
is intended to give patients more
time to recover from their dis-
ease, Cinti said it is both "very
serious" and a "last resort" for
the most seriously afflicted
patients.
All twelve patients are cur-
rently breathing with the help
of mechanical ventilators and
receiving aggressive treatment
to prevent infection while doc-

tors treat the underlying influ-
The patients range in age
from 22 to 58 and most were
considered healthy prior to con-
tracting the disease. This range
is consistent with 2009 infec-
tion patterns, which showed
younger demographics infected
at a higher rate than the elderly,
who were most likely exposed
to a similar form of the disease
many years ago.
H1N1 was most widely publi-
cized during 2009 - prior to the
creation of a vaccine - when it
killed over 470 individuals in
the U.S. Despite fadingfrom the
public spotlight, the disease has
been present in every flu season
since the pandemic, Cinti said.
"Last year it was just at a very
low level, but this year it's the
main flu going around," Cinti
said.
Since the current flu vaccine
is designed to protect individu-
als against the HINt flu strain,
doctors at UMHS speculate the
12 individuals currently in the
ICU did not receive the vaccine,
or were infected before it was
able to take effect.

Provost requests
accomodations for
stranded students
By MICHAEL SUGERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
As temperatures fell below
zero degrees across much of
Michigan, University admin-
istrators and staff are work-
ing to counteract the effects of

extreme weather conditions as
students return to school for the
start of the winter semester.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the campus will
not close for the extreme weath-
er and classes will not be can-
celed on Wednesday.
"Wednesday is the day that
is forecast to turn around a bit,"
Fitzgerald said. "Because of
the campus' largely residential
nature, it is really unusual for
the Ann Arbor campus to close

because of weather."
However, Fitzgerald advised
students who may be unable to
return to campus on Wednes-
day due to the weather to keep
in touch by email with their
instructors:
"What we've learned in the
past is that professors are very
much understanding of those
situations that are out of the
control of students," he said.

Yale assistant professor overdoses

Medical examiners revealed
Monday that 34-year-old Samuel
See, an assistant professor of Eng-
lish and American Studies at Yale
University, died of a heart attack
induced by an accidental over-
dose of acute methamphetamine
and amphetamine, Yale Daily
News reported.
See was found dead in jail last
November after a domestic dis-
pute with his husband, Sunder
Ganglani. The two men reported-
ly had protective orders against
one another, and both were
sent to jail when police discov-
ered Ganglani at See's home on
November 23rd. The New Haven
Police Department stated that
See resisted arrest, fell and was
cut above his left eye.

See received treatment for the
injury at Yale-New Haven Hospi-
tal and was detained immediately
after. He was found unresponsive
in his cell at 6 a.m. the next day.
Students and faculty members
interviewed were unaware of
See's drug use, though two sourc-
es knew of his ill health. Katie
Trumpener, an English professor,
said See once told her he was HIV
positive. Lindsey Uniat, a student
and advisee of See's, said See had
referenced having health issues
before, though he described them
as non-life-threatening.
Man discovered living in
Duke University's Bryan Center
Duke University police arrest-

ed a man Monday after a faculty
member found him living in the
Bryan Center, a central student
affairs building on campus, The
Chronicle reported.
The man was found sleeping
in the Religious Life office locat-
ed in the building's basement.
Chief of Police John Dailey
said the college-aged male was
arrested for breaking and enter-
ing and theft. He reportedly stole
several items, including an iPad
and a laptop. Duke faculty also
suspects the man is linked to the
theft of numerous previously sto-
len items.

they were beaten, but after

Odeh said the settlers

The military said the chain of
events apparently began after
Israeli authorities removed an

In recent years, militant set-

any attempts by the Israeli mili-

of rogue settlements, or out-
posts, by attacking Palestinians
and their property.
The tactic, begun in 2008, is
known as "price tag."
Villages in the area have
repeatedly come under attack
by militant settlers, said Odeh,
adding that assailants also set
fire to four area mosques in the
last three years.

Study finds
tobacco control
has saved 8M lives
Anti-smoking measures have
saved roughly 8 million U.S. lives
since a landmark 1964 report
linking smoking and disease, a
study estimates, yet the nation's
top disease detective says dozens
of other countries do a better/job
on several efforts to cut tobacco
use.
The study and comments were
published online Tuesday in the
Journal of the American Medi-
cal Association. This week's
issue commemorates the 50th
anniversary of the surgeon gen-
eral report credited with rais-
ing alarms about the dangers of
smoking.
In one study, researchers used
national health surveys and death
rates to calculate how many
deaths might have occurred since
1964 if Americans' smoking hab-
its and related deaths had contin-
ued at a pace in place before the
report.

Four killed in U.S.
helicopter crash
A U.S. Air Force Pave Hawk
helicopter crashed in the coastal
marshes of eastern England dur-

day night, killing all four crew
members aboard, officials said.
The helicopter crashed at
about 6 p.m. local time near
Salthouse on the Norfolk coast,
a statement from the U.S. Air
Force said. The aircraft was
based at the nearby Royal Air
Force station in Lakenheath,
Suffolk County, which hosts
USAF units and personnel.
Emergency workers from the
fire brigade, coast guard and
police are at the scene. Police in
Norfolk County said they believe
there is ammunition onboard
the helicopter, and the scene
was cordoned off so that experts
could ensure the area is safe.
Apart from the crew, nobody was

for the city and is not likely to be
utilized, even as shelter, accord-
ing to councilman Jack Eaton (D
- Ward 4).
"There has been an ongoing
public dialogue over why we
would allow empty buildings
like that," Eaton said."You have
people out in this kind of weath-
er, and you have empty build-
ings, and it's not hard to draw
that connection, and it's just that
there's all those details."
Mary Jo Callan, director of
Community Development for
Washtenaw County, reported to
the council that all shelters have
been open day and night this
week. Callan said Ann Arbor's
Delonis Center, which has a
capacity of 200, has not turned
down anyone to staythere so far.
She added that all shelters have
also loosened their rules on sub-

predicted that recovery will only

Logan said that although
these accidents are unfortunate,

Aside from the discussion
over the shelters, the city coun-
cil unanimously passed all old

discussion on any item.
The Traverwood Apartments
site plan was approved, as well
as usage of .27 acres of the wet-
lands for the development. The
complex will be comprised of 16

The council also approved a
plan to bring new restaurants

tionally, council approved the
Montgomery building site plan,
which would add four floors to
the existing building, along with
a few smaller items.
After minor wording and pen-
alty amendments from council
members Christopher Taylor
(D - Ward 3) and Sally Petersen
(D - Ward 2), the city policy for
removal of on-street metered
parking spaces was approved.
The ordinance requires develop-

for new construction to pay a
penalty. According to the leg-

removed over 200 parking spac-

Stocks tick up after
brief New Year slump

Averages rise but
future remains
uncertain for
investments
NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks ral-
lied Tuesday, ending a slump that
had ushered in the New Year.
The Standard and Poor's 500
index climbed the most in three
weeks, led by gains for health care
stocks. UnitedHealth Group, the
nation's largest health insurer, and
Johnson & Johnson both climbed
on recommendations for brokerage
firms.
After three straight declines,
the S&P 500 would have matched
its worst opening of a year since
1978 had it closed lower for a fourth
day. The stock market's slow start
to 2014 contrasts with last year's
exceptional performance,whenthe
S&P 500 climbed to record levels
aftersurgingalmost30percent.
"To me the trend still looks up,
even though we've been chop-
ping around," said Bill Stone,
chief investment strategist at PNC
Wealth Management Group. The
economy "seems to be in the mode
that you would expect corporate
earnings to continuetogrow"
The S&P 500 rose11.11points, or
0.6 percent, to 1,837.88, the biggest
gain since Dec. 18. Nine of the 10
sectors that make up the index rose.
The Dow Jones industrial aver-
age climbed 105.84 points, or 0.6
percent, to 16,530.94 The Nasdaq

composite gained 39.50 points, or 1
percent,to 4,153.18.
UnitedHealth group gained
$2.27, or 3.1 percent, to $76.51 after
analysts attDeutsche Bank said they
expected the nation's largest health
insurance company to charge cus-
tomers more in premiums thisyear.
Johnson & Johnson climbed
$1.96, or 2.1 percent, to $94.29 after
analysts at RBC Capital raised their
outlook on the stock to "outper-
form," in part due to optimism on
sales of the diabetes drug Invokana.
Investors were also encouraged
by the easy passage in a Senate
vote late Monday of Janet Yellen's
nomination to take the helm at the
Federal Reserve. The vote puts
an economist in the post who has
backed the Fed's recent efforts to
stimulate the economy with low
interest rates and huge bond pur-
chases.
The confirmation is a reminder
that the Fed's policiesof stimulating
the economy will likely continue,
said Kristina Hooper, U.S. Invest-
ment Strategist at Allianz Global
Investors.
"It's just a nice little halo effect,"
said Hooper.
Investors will get more insight
into the Fed's thinking when min-
utes from the Federal Open Mar-
ket Committee are released on
Wednesday. The Fed announced
after its last meeting that it would
begin winding down its monthly
$85 billion bond-buying program.
That stimulus was a major support
for last year's rally in stocks.

Minnesota man held
for nine months
for "defaming"
online video
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - An
American who's been held in the
United Arab Emirates for nine
months in connection with a
satirical online video about youth
culture in Dubai was expected to
be released soon, the U.S. State
Department said Tuesday.
Shezanne Cassim, 29, of
Woodbury, Minn., was arrested
in April, six months after he and
others uploaded their spoof docu-
mentary to the Internet.
The United Arab Emirates-
owned daily, The National, has
said Cassim and his co-defen-
dants were accused of defam-
ing the country's image abroad.
Cassim's supporters said he was
charged with endangering state
security under a 2012 cyber-
crimes law that tightened penal-
ties for challenging authorities.
Cassim has been in the maxi-
mum security prison at Abu
Dhabi since June. In December,
he was convicted and sentenced
to one year in prison, a fine and
deportation.
Pooja Jhunjhunwala, a State
Department spokeswoman, said
Tuesday that Cassim has been
moved to a deportation facility
for processing.
"We understand processing
will take a few days at which
point he will be returning to the

United States," she said, adding:
"We continue to work closely
with the UAE authorities to
ensure his quick release."
Cassim's family said Cassim
is out of his cell block and in a
deportation processing section
of the prison. They expect him to
return home this week.
"I can't tell you how relieved
our family is by this turn of
events," Cassim's brother, Sher-
von Cassim, said in a statement.
"We are very excited, and we are
grateful to everyone who worked
to free Shez."
State Department spokes-
woman Jen Psaki said Cassim
has been credited with pre-trial
detention time and given time off
for good behavior.
Rori Donaghy, director of the
London-based Emirates Cen-
ter for Human Rights, said a
defendant's release after serv-
ing three-fourths of a sentence is
customary.
Donaghy said Cassim and his
friends never should have been
imprisoned, and the cybercrimes
law needs to be changed, as
authorities have continued to use
it to restrict free speech.
Cassim, a U.S. citizen, was born
in Sri Lanka and moved to Dubai
for work after graduating from
the University of Minnesota in
2006. He became the public face
of the defendants after his family
launched an effort to publicize his
months-longincarceration.
Seven others were convicted
with him in December. Two
Indian defendants received simi-

lar sentences, while two Emi-
rati brothers received lighter
sentences. Donaghy said the Emi-
ratis have been released. Three
others - a Canadian, Briton and
an American - were convicted
and sentenced in absentia. They
have never been detained.
Donaghy said another Emirati
who spoke out in support of the
amateur filmmakers was arrest-
ed and remains imprisoned.
Gulf Arab authorities have
been cracking down on social
media use over the past twoyears,
with dozens of people arrested
across the region for Twitter
posts deemed offensive to lead-
ers or for social media campaigns
urging more political openness.
Cassim's video, titled "Ulti-
mate Combat System: The Deadly
Satwa Gs," is set in the Satwa dis-
trict of Dubai. It is a documentary-
style video that pokes fun at Dubai
youth who styled themselves
"gangstas" but are not particu-
larly thuggish, and shows fictional
"combat" training that includes
throwing a sandal and using a
mobile phone to call for help.
It opens with text saying the
video is fictional and is not meant
to offend.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar
(D-Minn.), who worked on Cas-
sim's release and pushed to have
his sentence include time served,
said: "Jailing this young man
for months for posting a harm-
less video made absolutely no
sense, especiallyin a country that
prides itself on being a tolerant
and just nation."

Buying democracy
Snyder introduces bill that reduces transparency in campaign donations
n Dec. 27, 2013, Governor Rick Snyder signed a law that doubles the
amount of campaign contributions individuals can donate. The law
also solidifies non-disclosure laws that hide the names of individual
and corporate donors from the public, inhibiting proper democratic oversight
of the election process. Duringhis gubernatorial campaign, Snyder blasted the
lax regulations on issue ads. He ran on the promise that he would force donors
to reveal their identities as well as reduce the amount of spending in political
campaigns. Transparency is crucial to the fair and democratic process of gov-
ernment. Snyder and the Michigan legislature should introduce more legisla-
tion increasing transparency, rather than promote non-disclosure.

either imbibe themselves emphati-
cally (somewhere between South U
and Main Street, of course) or spend
an unthinkable amount of time on
the couch catching up on the latest
Netflix offering, both as a means of
numbing the mind following their
undoubtedly roughest semester yet.
And who can blame them, really?
Exams are stressful. The weather
sucks. And at home family and
friends typically claim everyone's
holiday time months in advance.
But for me, this time serves as
the perfect reminder that there's
so much worth seeing in Metro
Detroit, including things without
equivalent in Ann Arbor, and even
in the United States. Unfortunately,
many University students rarely
take advantage of this during their
time here.
Though you may have missed
one perfect opportunity at the end
of last semester, an equally good
opportunity presents itself right
now at the beginning of another.
So, before another "worst-semes-
ter-ever" really heats up, grab your
nearest car-owning friend and
burst the Ann Arbor bubble for the
first time.

The new bill protects financial donors to
issue ads by allowing them to do so without
revealing their identities. Although issue ads
don't specifically endorse a specific political
candidate or proposal, the issue ads are overtly
political. Theyusually attack a specific official's
policy and can contain a line that tells viewers
to proactively take a stance on the issue by vot-
ing, calling political officials, etc. The ads have
been highly successful in the past and some
have even been labeled attack ads.
The new law requires these ads to reveal the
political group funding the ad, but it doesn't
require identification of financial donors. This
allows political groups to fund biased ads that
may be damaging or factually-questionable
without public repercussions. Groups that place
robocalls and issue ads will be required to pro-
vide an "authorized by" disclaimer, but those
statements won't give any information about
donors or support groups.
Thenewlaw willnowdouble campaigndona-
tionlimits, from $3,400 to $6,800 for candidates
for statewide office, from $1,000 to $2,000 for
candidates for state Senate, and to $1,000 from
$500 for candidates for the state House. The
limitswill increase slowlyovertime. Inthe 2010
gubernatorial race 99.992 percent of Michigan
residents did not reach the limit for campaign
donations. This will only allow more affluent
Michigan residents to have a more powerful say
in Michigan's gubernatorial race.
This legislation also solidifies the non-
disclosure laws that ensure the anonymity of
donors to political issue ads. Unable to discern
which individuals or what political groups may

be paying thousands to push an agenda, voters
participate in government without knowing
which issues are promoted by special interests
with a history of controversies with transpar-
ency, including the New Energy to Reinvent
and Diversify Fund, Snyder should be aiming
to improve Lansing's transparency rather than
further restricting public access to information.
This new law is a complete turnaround from
Snyder's platform position in2010,whenhe pub-
lished an administrative report, which argued
that the anonymity of political donors harmed
Michigan voters. The publication argued that
the combination of large political contributions
and anonymous donorscreated a "perfect storm
where citizens become disenfranchised with
politics ... unable to follow who istryingto influ-
ence policy and for what reasons."
The expanded funding cap furthers the
movement towards monetizing governmental
policy by increasing access to the wealthiest
of individuals. It promotes support for special
interest groups and encourages a system where
the most affluent citizens are able to heav-
ily influence government policy and elections.
Since the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court
case, corporations and wealthy individuals
have been able to donate ludicrous amounts of
money in support or opposition of a candidate
under their first amendment right. This creates
a system in which candidates are focused on
appealing to who may make the largest dbna-
tions instead offocusingonthe people. Snyder's
new law only further propels this trend toward
buying officials, alienating the people from the
democratic process.

CE HOCKEY
What we learned: First half

Freshman guard Siera Thompson has led all scorers in the Wolverines' past two contests, scoring a combined 38 points.
M !
Michig adominatesglass
despite size disadvantage

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team got off on the right
foot Sunday when it traveled to
Columbus and dismantled the
Buckeyes, 64-49, to open confer-
ence play.
And despite NOTEBOOK
the Wolverines'
low shooting percentage - 36.2
percent for the game - Michi-
gan (1-0 Big Ten, 10-4 overall)
found its offense from the free-
throw line. The Wolverines made
a season-high 26 free throws and
shot 92.9 percent from the charity
stripe, including a perfect 20-for-
20 in the second half. It was the
third straight win for Michigan,
which will have its first home
game of 2014 on Thursday.
"Anytime you can come to Ohio
and come away with a victory is
terrific," said Michigan coach Kim
BarnesArico. "Thatwas oneofthe
first things upon taking this job
- everybody told me about this
rivalry. It's important."
Junior forward Nicole Elmblad
recorded her fifth double-double
of the season,.with 10 points and -
12 rebounds. Freshman point
guard Siera Thompson led all
scorers with 18 points.
DOMINATING DOWN
LOW: Coming into the season,

Barnes Arico cited size as a con-
cern, but her team ranks fifth in
the Big Ten in rebounds per game
and third in offensive boards. But
their rebounding defense and
rebounding margin, which is best
in the conference, have compen-
sated for their size disadvantage.
"Our ability to box out has
been great, and we really are the
most undersized team," Barnes
Arico said. "But because of that,
it's something we try to work on
each and every single day, and we
try to make it atoughness thing."
Rebounding is leading to
success, as evidenced by the
Wolverines' 10-2 record when
out rebounding their opponent.
A reason for the surprising ability
on the boards starts with junior
forward Cyesha Goree, who
has exceeded all expectations
as a starter. Goree is second on
the team with 8.6 boards per
game, but averages 10 fewer
minutes than the team's leading
rebounder, Elmblad. She now
has five games with double-digit
rebounds and has joined Elmblad
as an irreplaceable player for
Michigan.
It should come as no surprise,
then, that Barnes Arico often
cites Goree and Elmblad as
the hardest-working players in
practice. Both players had 12
rebounds and helped Michigan

dominate Ohio State on the glass,
leading the team to outrebound
the Buckeyes by 15.
"They've really stepped up,
and its great to have a night like
that," Barnes Arico said. "But we
are continuing to work on their
ability to crash the boards."
RED-HOT THOMPSON:
When Thompson came to
Michigan, she knew she had big
shoes to fill at point guard after
Jenny Ryan graduated. But the
California native has stepped up
to the challenge and taken the
starting position by the horns.
In the last two games,
Thompson has scored 20 and
18 points, leading all scorers
in both contests. This season,
she's second on the team with 14
points per game and has scored in
double digits 10 times. Thompson
also adds 3.9 rebounds and 3.6
assists per game, illustrating her
impact on most possessions.
Her emergence is one of the
reasons the Wolverines have
shaken off the "transition year"
and "rebuilding" labels and
instead look poised to make a
run in the Big Ten and reach a
third straightNCAA Tournament
berth in March.
"One step at a time," Barnes
Arico said. "One step at a time,
but this team really works hard
and it's showing."

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
1. So much for clutch.
The No. 8 Michigan hockey
team thrives on late-game
drama, or at least it used to.
During the first half of the
season, the Wolverines (2-0 Big
Ten, 10-4-2 overall) entered
seven overtime frames and left
unscathed five times, skating
off with four wins. Seven of
Michigan's first 10 wins were
decidedby just one goal.
But a seven-round shootout
victory against then-No. 4 Ferris
State - the game officially ended
in a tie - was flanked by two
overtime losses, one in an exhi-
bition against the U.S. National
Team Development Program
and one against Michigan Tech
in the Great Lakes Invitational.
And though an exhibition doesn't
count against the Wolverines'
record, the loss to the U.S. NTDP
came after two near-collapses to
Ohio State.
Then, at the GLI, without
leading scorer and sophomore
forward Andrew Copp, Michi-
gan was burned for the first time,
laying down to the Huskies in
overtime, 3-2. In the consolation
game, the Wolverines were shut
out for the first time this season.
A trademark of all good
Michigan teams, according to
coach Red Berenson, is a strong
start to the game. This team
has some of that same muscle,
outscoring opponents 17-6 in
the first period, but it also has an
ungainly trademark of its own -
allowing early leads to slip away.
In order to remain a top-10
team, the Wolverineswillhaveto
ditch the drama and bear down
in the third period.
2. Ready or not, here comes
the Big Ten.
With three ranked teams and
some of the nation's most highly
touted programs, the Big Ten
promises to be as entertaining on
the ice as it is on the hardwood.
In the first-ever Big Ten
matchup between Michigan and
Ohio State, an overtime thriller
set the stage for what should be
an exciting inaugural conference
season. The Wolverines escaped
with a 3-2 overtime victory at
Yost Ice Arena and surrendered
a three-goal lead to the Buckeyes
in Columbus just nights later.
In the GLI, it took fewer than
two minutes into the first period

of the consolation game for
Michigan State forward Thomas
Ebbing to net a goal. Michigan
then went on to drop its final
non-conference matchup to a
conference foe, 3-0.
Marquee wins over Boston
College, Boston University and
New Hampshire, as well as a tie
with No. 3 Ferris State, place the
Wolverines solidly in national
championship contention. Still,
Michigan has yet to encounter
No. 1 Minnesota, ateam that has
seen more time atop the standing
than any other in the nation.
And the Wolverines have
looked far from dominant in
their first three contests against
unranked Big Ten opponents.
With the bulk of the
conference season upcoming
and a crucial series against No.
14 Wisconsin this weekend, it
remains to be seen if this young
team is ready for Big Ten hockey.
3. Youth is not an excuse.
The shutout loss to the Spar-
tans marked the first time this
season that Michigan freshmen
failed to record a point ina game
- and that's a good sign.
Among the many questions
that followed the Wolverines
from a disappointing 2012-13
season into this one was the
immediate impact of an 11-man
freshman class.
Forwards Tyler Motte, JT
Compher and Evan Allen have
provided answers. The trio reg-
istered a combined 13 goals in the
first half, adding to Michigan's
impressive 3.13 goals per game.
When Racine, Michigan's
outright starter in goal, went
down with a hamstring injury
in New Hampshire, freshman
Zach Nagelvoort was thrust into
the net. His performance dur-
ing Racine's absence answered
questions about the Wolverines'
depth between the pipes - a
luxury the team wasn't afforded
last season
Still, the GLI wasthe first
time Michigan showed signs of
inexperience. On rough ice in
front of alarge crowd at Comerica
Park, not even the presence of
Motte or the return of Compher
from a foot injury could prevent
the Wolverines from dropping
two straight games for the first
time this season.
4. Defensive questions
resurface.
Before the season began,

senior defenseman Mac Bennett
said the defense, the team's
biggestpreseason question mark,
would surprise the naysayers.
While Berenson and his staff
tinkered with line pairings to
ignite the offense, the defense
held teams off and allowed
Nagelvoort to find his place in
net. Meanwhile, the penalty
kill quickly became Michigan's
strongest unit.
Then, freshman defenseman
Kevin Lohan tore his anterior
cruciate ligament against
Michigan Tech. Junior Mike
Chaisson and other Wolverines
have done well in his place, but
the defense isn't the same.
At first, it lacked offensive
production. The unit was held
without a goal until the last
weekend of November, and it
wasn't creating enough scoring
chances from the blue line.
But then, it faltered at its main
job - defensive coverage.
Michigan has allowed 40
shots in a game four times this
season and has been beaten for
costly goals on more than one
occasion. Against the Huskies,
freshman defenseman Nolan
De Jong and junior defenseman
Brennan Serville were beaten
minutes before Bennett allowed
a costly turnover - two mistakes
that led to Michigan Tech scores.
The defense was once a
pleasant surprise, but it needs
to improve to avoid becoming a
liability.
5. Stick to the sign.
A sign that reads "win the
next game" sits in the home
locker room at Yost Ice Arena, a
sign that reminds a young team
to play each matchup with the
same intensity. Perhaps the Wol-
verines forgot to bring it to their
locker room at Comerica Park.
Still, the last-place finish is
arguablythe only dark spot ofthe
first half. And that's something
to hang a hat on.
lhtiphjgan entered, htnvi-
tational boasting 10 wins, more
than it could claim at the same
time last season. The Wolver-
ines maintained a top-10 ranking
after beginning the season at No.
13 by bouncing back from losses
and escaping close games.
After the GLI disappointment,
Michigan will have a sour taste
in its mouth entering the New
Year. But one bad tournament
can't erase the foundation that

Mike Bottom views this season
as a series of building blocks, then
the Orange Bowl Classic was a
capstone for the 24th-ranked
Wolverines, as the women won all
12 events.
"It's an understandingthat it's
not aboutwhere you are today but
about moving yourself forward
and gettingbetter for tomorrow,"
Bottom said. "And since we're
a sport where everything is
measured in hundredths of
seconds, it's good to see when
something is working."
For senior Angie Chokaran,
watching the Wolverines sweep
the meet was something that she
had been dreaming of since she
first arrived at Michigan.
"We placed first in every
event," Chokran said. "And that's
amazing to me because I've seen
the men do that in meets in my
past three years here, and I would
look up to them for that. So to see
our team do that, it was phenom-
enal. It was a great way to start
off the second half of the season."
Even though the meet, which
took place in Key Largo, Fla., was
a nice escape from the cold for
the Wolverines, it wasn't time
for basking in the sun. Chokran
said the team spent its days doing
"high-intensity training" in order
to prepare it for the competition
and the second half of its season.
All of the high-intensity train-
ing paid off - Michigan broke five

freshman Julia Fiks-Salem broke
the first record of the meet.
DeLoof went on to break a
meet record in the 50-meter
backstroke with a time of 28.69,
and sophomore Marni Oldershaw
broke the meet record in the 100-
meter breaststroke soon after.
And Mattingly, not to be bested
byherteammates, broke the meet
record in the 50-meter butterfly.
The team of DeLoof, Mattingly,
Fiks-Salem and freshman
Madeline Frost closed out the
meet by setting a record in the
200-meter freestyle relay.
The win at the Orange Bowl
Classic was Michigan's first
meet since the Winter National
Championships, which took place
at the beginning of December.
According to Chokran, the
Wolverines approached the two
meets very differently, yet came
out with similar results.
"The Winter National
(Championships) ... was a great
meet for us because we were all
well-rested," Chokran said. "But
coming into this meet, when
we're all deadbeat tired ... it was
hard to have high expectations,
but we're Michigan women and
this is what we do: we get our
hand on the wall first."
The mid-season training trip
was also an opportunity for the
Wolverines to build up team
camaraderie.
"This trip has helped us come

got to bond as a team by spending
so much quality time together."
Outside of the pool, the
Wolverines spent their time
exploring Key Largo, which
included spending New Year's
Eve on a boat watching fireworks.
"It was kind of symbolic for us
because it was a buildingyear last
year, and this year we're really
getting the ball rolling," Chokran
said.
Now the Wolverines are
working toward accomplishing
their goals at both the Big Ten
championship and the national
championship.
"The Big Ten is a very deep
conference, and we're very
fortunate to be in it," Bottom
said. "But I think what we'll see
is a team that will come out and
race with confidence. We're not
the best swimmers in the water,
and we won't be at the (Big Ten
Championship), but that doesn't
mean that our girls won't stand
up and race."
And in order to finish strong,
Bottom is planning on installing
the final building block for the
Wolverines: speed.
"We're down to about 20 days
of practice for the Big Ten (Cham-
pionship) and in that time we're
going to continue to get faster,"
Bottom said. "We've worked real-
ly hard, and we're now ready to
move onto the speed component
of our training and get faster."

"The sky's the limit:" How freshman Adam Coon
posted Michigan's best start in program history

By ZACH SHAW
Daily Sports Writer
Freshman wrestler Adam
Coon tightened his grip. His
muscles tensed, Coon shifted his
weight to improve his leverage,
but to no avail. Seconds later,
Coon released his grip, admitting
defeat.
The young wrestler doesn't
interact with defeat often, but
after helping demonstrate the
suctioning power and weight of
the Earth's atmosphere by try-
ing to pull a glass plate off a suc-
tioning tube in his physics class,
Coon accepted the rare loss. The
attentive front-row studentknew
the experiment was impossible
to beat from the start.
"(My professor) uses me for
examples whenever he needs a
big tough guy to prove a point,"
Coon said. "He also just wants to
embarrass me; for the most part
it works."
The physics professor is one of
the select few to beat Coon lately.
Since the 6-foot-5, 255-pound
heavyweight wrestler won his
collegiate debut in double-over-
time over Northern Illinois's
Jared Torrence on Nov. 16, no
one else has beaten him.
With a 20-0 record, Coon is
not only the best wrestler on
No. 14 Michigan's team right
now, but also one of the best in
the country, recently ranked as
the No. 2 heavyweight wrestler
in recent polls. He's also off
to the best start to a career in
the program's 88-year history,
besting the 18-0 start by eventual
three-time All-American and
two-time NCAA champion
Kellen Russell in 2007-08.
The streak began in November,
but anyone around Coon knows
the success was years in the
making. The son of a former
Division III wrestler, who now
coaches high school wrestling
in addition to serving as director
of the Michigan branch of USA
Wrestling, Coon was pushed into
wrestling not long after he could
walk, competing as early as four
years old.
"We first noticed him when he
was in grade school at some point
in time," said Michigan coach
Joe McFarland. "He's always

knows a target has developed on
his back.
"My mindset's changed in that
now instead of being the under-
dog, I'm level with my opponent,"
Coon said. "No matter who they
are, I know they're going to bring
their best, so I have to increase
my intensity."
Based on recent practices,
McFarland doesn't think Coon
will have a problem doing that.
With the early success, Coon
and his coaches have increased
the energy at practices in
preparation for Big Ten play.
Taking it all in stride, Coon has
quickly transformed from a
wide-eyed freshman into one of
the team's leaders.
"I still have to remind myself
that he's a freshman," McFarland
said. "His approach to every-
thing has been a great thing for
the program, I think the energy
he brings to ourline-up has been
nothing short of great. Now
there are all these other young
guys looking at him and saying,
'He's a true freshman who can go
out there and beat all these top
ranked guys, why can't I?"'
As the season wears on,
Michigan's optimism grows
with each of Coon's matches.
As the daunting Big Ten season
approaches, the Wolverines
have cautious confidence that

Freshman Adam Coon has posted the best start to a season in Michigan wrestling's 88-year history, a 20-0 record.

excelled on the wrestling mat,
but when kids are that young you
just don't know what the future
holds for them in the sport. But
he's always excelled on the mat;
he's very driven."
Growing up in Fowlerville -
a mid-Michigan town of under
3,000 - Coon soon became the
pride of his community. In addi-
tion to winning four straight
state titles and compiling a 212-3.
record, Coon was a four-year let-
ter winner in football and track,
earning all-state honors at line-
backer and placing runner-up
in discus and shot-put. With a
high school career worthy of the
Detroit Athletic Club's Michigan
High School Athlete of the Year
in 2013, Coon had athletic oppor-
tunities all over the country.
But after deciding to wrestle,
Coon felt most comfortable just
45 minutes from home.
"Above anything else was the
academics," Coon said. "I want
to go into aerospace engineering,
and not many schools have that
program,andiftheydo,itisn'tthe
top-notch program Michigan's
is. Outside of the classroom, this
coaching staff is definitely oe of
the best in the country and that
was a huge factor for choosing
the right school."
Upon arriving to Ann Arbor,
Coon didn't take long to make
waves. With four-year starter
Ben Apland graduating the

previous spring, Michigan's
depth was thin at the
heavyweight class. But after just
a couple of practices, McFarland
and his staff knew they had a
worthy replacement.
"We wanted to see how he
was doing in practice and in
the classroom first," McFarland
said. "He was making incredible
strides right away. He comes in
and he's just completely focused
on them. No goofing around, no
talking about other things, he
comes into the practice room and
he starts getting himself ready."
When Coon was officially
named the starter, McFarland
knew immediately that he had
made the right decision.
"When we sat him down and
told him we were planning on
wrestling him, I wanted to see
what kind of reaction we would
get from him. I could tell by the
look on his face right away that
he was excited to be wrestling,
and it'sbeen all good stuff since."
The "good stuff" includes
heavyweight championships
at the Cliff Keen Invitational
in Las Vegas and the Midlands
Championshipsin E astoni '-n
the latter, Coontook dowenthe
nation's then-No. 3 heavyweight
Bobby Telford of Iowa to claim
the first Wolverine title at the
tournament since 2002. Often
wrestling opponents 20 pounds
heavier than him, McFarland
feels Coon's greatest strength is
his mind.
"The key to his success has

been his mindset," McFarland
said. "He doesn't look at a guy's
reputation, he doesn't look at a
guy's record or ranking, he just
goes out and wrestles the body in
front of him.
"He's ready to go to war
every time he steps on a mat. He
doesn't ease himself into these
matches. You can see when the
ref blows the whistle he's right
across the mat into that guy's
face. He doesn't take a backseat
to anybody."
With 20 wins under his belt
and now the No. 2 heavyweight
wrestler in the country, Coon

Coon can be the program's first
Big Ten heavyweight champion
since Airron Richardson in 1998.
With eight ofthe country's top
12 heavyweight wrestlers hail-
ing from the conference, Cook
knows it won't be easy. But with
four years of conference and
national tournaments ahead of
him, the long-term goal is clear.
"I want a ring before I
graduate," Coon said. "The
whole team does. From here on
out we all have to be leaders and
keep pushing towards that goal
that everyone wants.
"We have a great freshman
class, and I know each and every
one of them is putting in the
extra time to make sure that we
are going to be the elite ones
down the road. I've put my trust
into this team and the coaching
staff, and if it doesn't come this
year it will come in the future."
Beyond Michigan, Coon's
goals remain lofty. In addition to
an NCAA championship, Coon
will make an effort to represent
his country in the 7016 Olympics
his junior year. After graduating,
the former all-state linebacker
hopes to earn a spot on an NFL
team.
"He's a great role model and
a great representative of the
University of Michigan, and our
athletic program and wrestling
department," McFarland said.
"I'm excited that he sets the bar
high for himself, and if he just
keeps pushing himself and stays
focused, the sky's the limit for
him."
Well, not quite. In addition to
athletic aspirations, Coon hopes
to use his aerospace engineering
degree to achieve one final goal
of his: to go into space. While
NASA vehicles only allow a
maximum height of 6-foot-3
in their crafts, Coon hopes to
someday change that. Given
what he's accomplished so far,
what's to stop him?
Coon once again tightened his
grip. As his muscles tensed, Coon
shifted his weight to improve his
leverage. This time it worked,
and Coon was able to duck under
Iowa's Telford, coming around
top to score two points and clinch
the Midlands Championships.
Coon may not be able to lift the
atmosphere, but that won't stop
him from making his mark on his
opponents and Michigan history.

Coon not only aspires to win an NCAA title, but also to compete in the NFL.

What Michigan can learn from Auburn's resurgence

A sbad as the Michigan
football team was this
eason, Auburn was
worse last year.
Much worse, actually, at least
record-wise. Michigan's 7-6
record in 2013 was a chilly day
to the Tigers's 3-9 polar vortex
of a 2012 season.
But the
college
football
world
changes
fast.
Auburn
played
for the
ZACH national
HELFAND champi-
onship
Monday,
a 34-31 loss in the final seconds
against Florida State.
Plays like this make it easy to
characterize the Tigers' season
as a string of miracles. And luck
played an important role. More
than luck, though, Auburn's
turnaround resulted from a
string of discrete changes.
Those changes are how
Auburn went from winless in
the Southeastern Conference to
a play away from a champion-
ship the following season. And
they provide a blueprint for a
team like Michigan, hoping to
go from 7-6 to something better.
So what can Michigan learn?
It begins with evaluation.
Why was Auburn so bad? Its
defensive-oriented head coach
had a defense in disarray with

an offense struggling to adapt
to the pro style. Its coaching
failed to develop and deploy the
roster's still-formidable talent.
And it lacked production at a
major position - in this case, at
quarterback.
Sounds reasonably familiar.
Michigan's own defensive-
oriented head coach, Brady
Hoke, has an offense struggling
to adapt to the pro style after
several seasons of spread-heavy
football. At most positions,
Michigan has recruited well
for years, but the system hasn't
suited the recruits. The Wolver-
ines appear set at quarterback
but face a similar absence of
production at the offensive line.
The Tigers addressed each
problem directly. The coach
was a problem, so he was fired.
His replacement, Gus Malzahn,
installed a system that was
better adapted to his players'
strengths, and an influx of
new recruits on the defensive
line bolstered the defense. To
address the quarterback prob-
lem, Malzahn recruited junior
college transfer Nick Marshall.
The fixes for Michigan won't
be the same, nor will the result.
The Wolverines rarely get
junior college transfers, and
Hoke won't, and shouldn't, be
fired after his third year.
But the lesson from Auburn
is this: a quick turnaround is
possible by addressing each
issue directly and definitively.
That process resurrected an
Auburn team just a helpless as

Michigan. How will Michigan
address its own problems?
There's the question of
coaching, especially on the
offensive side of the ball. After
the regular season, Hoke said
he does not plan on changing
his staff at all. Still, Athletic
Director Dave Brandon's
exclamation-point-riddled
statement of support for Hoke
included praise for defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison, but
offensive coordinator Al Borges
was conspicuously left out.
Whether with Borges or
with a replacement, Michigan's
offense needs a pretty major
change. Its pro-style offense
doesn't really even mirror the
pros anymore, mainly because
the game has changed and
offenses have adapted.
Auburn made a major
shift with Malzahn's hurry-
up, speed-rushing offense.
Michigan's offense needs a
change of a similar magnitude.
That should also alleviate
the second major issue - the
mismatch between Michigan's
talent and production. Plus, it
appears Michigan's top recruit,
Jabrill Peppers, doesn't need
much development to make an
immediate impact, no matter
the system. That should help
the embattled secondary and
add an explosive element to the
offense.
The third, more difficult
issue is the offensive line. The
young interior should make
a big improvement from a

miserable 2013. But losing two
NFL-caliber tackles might
result in a wash.
Auburn made a personnel
move to address its quarterback
issue. Michigan doesn't have
the luxury of a quick replace-
ment, so it must find a different
change. The difficulty of finding
such a quick fix on the offensive
line means Michigan probably
shouldn't expecta season quite
like Auburn's.
At the very least, though,
there shouldn't be a repeat of
the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl,
when the players shuffling
around the locker room offered
explanations for a failed season.
"I think just a lot of guys lost

the will to play as a family,"
said junior defensive end Frank
Clark.
"It was just our mindset from
the jump," said sophomore
linebacker James Ross III. "We
weren't totally into it, I would
say."
In football, things like chem-
istry and motivation matter.
offseason preparation mat-
ters. Before the championship
game Monday, Auburn's players
talked about a culture change,
a regained confidence. This off-
season, inevitably, Michigan's
players will mention similar
buzzwords, like "improved
work ethic" and "drive" and
"cohesion." And if those things

are true, that's a good thing for
Michigan.
But we tend to place too
much emphasis on those intan-
gible qualities and write off a
quick resurgence as miraculous,
beyond explanation. Really,
Michigan's problems are much
more fundamental and much
easier to see.
The real miracle for Auburn
was that it addressed its own
problems so honestly and force-
fully. If the Wolverines don't do
the same, then it might be time
to pray.

the writer's notebook: I'm a writer, you're not by max radwin

I'm a writer. You're not. At least,
that's what I'd like to think, or used
to think.
I've always held the belief that
artists are born that way. They're
born writers, painters, sculptors,
composers, whatever.
Sure, you can practice an art.
But if you weren't born with some
kind of condition - a persuasion
that allows you to see the world ina
way that others can't - then you're
just another dabbling ina world not
meant for your art.
Of course, you can write and not
be a writer. A news reporter writes
but isn't necessarily one. E.L. James
certainly writes, but isn't one. The
only way to define a writer ... is as
a writer. But is that definition suf-
ficient? Are there specific char-
acteristics to be attributed to the
profession? Or is it just a vague,
inherited birthright?
I didn't come up with this con-
cept. My insight is inherited from
other artists: Edward Hirsch ("The
Demon and the Angel," which
explores this topic in great length),
Lorca, Mill, Milton or any other
writer who gives credit to the muse
or duende. Even the shitty ones like
Stephanie Meyer credit supernatu-
ral sources like dreams - which
presumably come to those individu-
als who have the tools to turn the
metaphysical into works of art.

MICHIGAN
ILLUSTRATION BY MEGAN MULHOLLAND

After Frank O'Hara died, scraps
of paper were found stuffed into
his desk drawers. They were poems
that he had written "spontaneous-
ly" as he walked around New York
City, and which were published
with little to no secondary editing.
He was a poet - a true poet - so
why would they have to be edited?
I got this way of thinking into my
head early. It made me believe that
I was artistically superior to pretty
much everyone. And while Iact like
a prick because of it, I also think
that you kind of need that mindset
if you want to be good, and so I'm
almost thankful for it. I take big
risks creatively because I hold on to
that sense of artistic authority.
And I have that artistic authority
because I'm a born artist - a born
writer, which I could, until late,
only define tautologically.
And it's that circular logic that

gave me problems, often without
even knowing it. When a short story
of mine was recently workshopped,
there were major experimental
sections that people responded to
negatively. My initial response was,
"It's not my fault if you don't get
the premise. This is exactly how
it's supposed to be written." I even
went so far as to think, "Perhaps
this will be appreciated when I'm
gone. It's too ahead of its time." In
reality, I had failed to accept some-
thing that needs to happen in first
drafts. My conceitedness had led
to some artistic bravado, but had
stunted the advancement of my
project.
I started a lifetime habit of vora-
cious reading when I was young not
only because it was immersive, but
also because I knew I was honing a
skill that was rare and valuable.
See WRITER, Page 3B

As I reflect on my student-ath-
lete journey beginning six years
ago as a freshman walk-on at the
University of Michigan, I can't
resist shedding light on a topic
that remains unmentioned in
today's culture and sports media.
Playing a sport at Michigan was
a dream come true for a local west
Michigan girl like me, who pretty
much came out of nowhere as a
nobody. Though there are many
perks to being an athlete, there
are equally difficult mental tri-
als and tribulations that every
student-athlete must face. While
it's easy to point out the perks,
many people forget to consider
the 40-plus hours a week put in
behind the scenes when 100,000
fans aren't showing up to cheer.
Sure, the glitz and glamor of game
day is pretty incredible, but there
are also the day-to-day difficulties
of mentally managing the con-
stant pressure of being a student-
athlete.
Whether a highly touted

ENTREPRENEURIAL
From Page 6B
Parikh's time at the helm of CSG brought
entrepreneurship to a more campus-wide
consciousness, but that was not without the
help of other student groups on campus like
MPowered.
MPowered's mission is to expose students
to entrepreneurship, which it does through
large-scale events like its 1,000 Pitches com-
petition, where students from the University
and Pennsylvania State University compete
to give the best pitch for their business ideas.
O'Neil, the MPowered president, said events
like these are meant to excite University stu-
dents about entrepreneurship.
Over the past few years, O'Neil said he's
seen an increase in participation in events
like 1,000 Pitches. The last 1,000 Pitches
event occurred this fall, and garnered over
6,000 entrepreneurial pitches total - with
"x",000 of those pitches coming from the Uni-
versity alone.
"Students at Michigan are already amaz-
ing, you don't need to hold their hands. All
they need is that excitement," O'Neil said.
Branching out: an interdisciplinary
approach
By now we all know the dream: start a
company and become the next Mark Zucker-
berg. While this idea may conjure up images
of coffee-fueled business students typing
s.way furiously into the night, startup and
entrepreneurial culture is not only growing
in Ross' Winter Garden. Some of the best
startups come from teams with mixed edu-
cational backgrounds. Before he dropped
out, Zuckerberg was studying psychology.
Though entrepreneurial programs were
initially restricted to business and engineer-
ing students, the recent push to include all
majors has allowed the University to fos-
ter a more inclusive environment. This has
been done through co-University sponsored
events like Mingle 'n' Match nights, which
aim to help student entrepreneurs from any
school find members for their startup teams
as well as help them network. Large-scale
events like MHacks II, hosted in Michi-
gan Stadium last fall, also strive to enhance
networking and communication platforms
between student entrepreneurs.
O'Neil said the past 1,000 Pitches event
included a proportionate amount of students
from each college at the University. This rep-
resentation shows that entrepreneurship is
no longer being seen as "just a business," or
"just an engineering" endeavor, but rather
something open to the entire campus.
Parikh said he believes the growth of
entrepreneurship amongst all schools at the
University has made it a concept that unites
the student body, much like Michigan Foot-
ball.
"Kind of like our football stadium, the
f-.Big House, (entrepreneurship) encompasses
students from all kinds of disciplines and all
kinds of ages," Parikh said. "Together we

come together, like in the Big House, to cre-
ate a solidified impact."
Thornhill said the diversity of students
involved in entrepreneurship is beneficial for
student startup teams.
"Having a team of just business students,
or just engineers, or just life science students
... creates a gap in your skill set," Thornhill
said. "If I were going to invest in a company
I'd far rather look for that diversity of skill
profile than a group of students that came
from one concentration."
Though the University has started to
increase the collaboration between schools,
O'Neil believes some students still face dif-
ficulty trying to find team members from
other colleges.
"You often find business students or engi-
neers who have these great ideas, but they
don't know how to find or talk to the develop-
ers who also have these great ideas," O'Neil
said. "They often can't find common ground
- which is a huge problem."

O'Neil said that while there were other
factors, like the amount of venture capital

rock to move MHacks, they also needed newer,
larger spaces with more office equipment to

TV "It made a lot of sense to go to Detroit

conceptions about Detroit.

WRITER

From Page 3B

But I wasn't actually writ-
ing during that period of my life.
Despite not actively partaking in
the practice, I associated myself
with the profession. And retro-
spectively, I recognize that that
way of thinking was detrimental
to my development as a creative
writer.
I was a thinker and a philoso-
pher - maybe - but not a writer.
And who wants to be those use-
less things? I needed to put those
thoughts and philosophies into
action, into application. Into my
art.
That application is the sole
defining factor: What is a writer?
It's simple. A writer is someone
who writes.
Now, I write almost everyday,
though reading and philosophiz-
ing are still important. My profes-
sion finally is my practice. Maybe
you're a writer too. And if you

to do is pick up a pencil.

The 'Silicon Mitten'
California's Bay Area has become synony-
mous with startup and tech culture, earning
it the name Silicon Valley, but could Michi-
gan become the next greatstartup and entre-
preneurial community?
Despite the bankruptcy and bad press,
Detroit has seen several large companies
move to its downtown area - most notably
Quicken Loans, an online mortgage lender.
In a 2013 interview with Reuters, Quicken
Loans CEO Dan Gilbert said his interest in
Detroit was partially to help stop the state's
brain drain and give young people a reason to
stay in Michigan.
Frank said he thinks that although entre-
preneurship is growing across the country,
it's growing more in Michigan because of its
central location and its entrepreneurial spir-
it increases opportunities for startups.

Michigan and Detroit were built on entre-
preneurship going back to the fur trade and
automotive industries, she doesn't think the
area will ever be fully comparable to Silicon
Valley.
"I don't think Detroit or Michigan is even

Hail to the innovators
While student entrepreneurs at the Uni-
versity usually focus on building their own
companies, throughout the years they have
been busy building something else from the
ground-up: an entrepreneurial community.
This was achieved through Zurbuchen's
ingredients for entrepreneurial success:
hard work and an active mindset for growth.
"Entrepreneurship is a way of thinking,
taking innovations and turning them into
real-life change," Zurbuchen said.
"Entrepreneurship is of course starting
companies, but there are many activities that
are totally entrepreneurial that don't involve
a start-up ... It's about taking a big idea and
turning (it) into action."

The Silicon aitten
Michigan's changing entrepreneurial landscape

Its gone viral. It's all across campus. It's not
an app, but in recent years, it's a movement
buzzing with energy all across phone
screens, Facebook profiles, posting walls.
And it's rapidly evolving.
by K.C. Wassman, Daily Staff Reporter

Zurbuchen's new role as senior entrepreneurial adviser may
not seem as consequential as the opening of two entrepreneurial
powerhouses. However, his appointment marks an important
shift in the way entrepreneurship at the University works: from
the individual to the collaborative group. One of Zurbuchen's
jobs is to design an academic program in entrepreneurship
which will be available to all majors, which is a stark contrast
from where the different entrepreneurial programs started.
Originally, Zell Lurie and the Center for Entrepreneurship
stayed in their respective corners: Zell Lurie in the Ross School
of Business on Central Campus, and the Center for Entrepre-
neurship in the Duderstadt Center on North Campus - primar-
ily supporting only their home communities.
As the buzz around entrepreneurship grew, so did students'
desire to utilize both Zell Lurie and the Center for Entrepre-
neurship, regardless of whether or not they were majoring in
business or engineering.
Mary Lemmer was one of those students. Lemmer started
Iorio's Gelateria with her brother Nick while she was in high
school, and decided to come to the University to further her
entrepreneurial ventures through Zell Lurie. However, when
she learned about the Center for Entrepreneurship's speaker
series, she decided to try and attend those classes as well as
Zell Lurie's. Though it was difficult, Lemmer worked with both
departments and was eventually allowed to take the courses
with both Zell Lurie and the Center for Entrepreneurship.
The Center for Entrepreneurship offers about 40 courses
available to students from other colleges, a 9-credit Program in
Entrepreneurship certificate program, and collaborations with
Zell Lurie on many different programs includingthe Masters in
Entrepreneurship program, a joint degree from the College of
Engineering and the Ross School of Business which was started
in the fall of 2011.
"If I would describe (the Center for Entrepreneurship) in
comparison to a company's life cycle, it was the early-stages of
really focused entrepreneurial resources for students on cam-
pus, and now they've grown a lot, which is great to see," Lem-
mer said.
A growing resource hub
Apart from expanding programs to other schools, the
University has increased the available resources to student
entrepreneurs. The University's TechArb is a student startup
accelerator program run between the Center for Entrepreneur-
ship and Zell Lurie, and gives student startup teams the office
space to work on their businesses. Nestled in the lower level
of an office building on East Liberty Street, the TechArb also
offers other resources besides physical office space, such as
mentors and introductions with venture capitalists.
Like many students, University alum Jason Bornhorst didn't
come to the University thinking he'd delve into entrepreneur-
ship. He thought he'd get his degree in computer science, gradu-
ate and get into the startup scene later. Instead, Bornhorst got
involved with the Center for Entrepreneurship and later found-
ed MadeVentures - a student group which together to talk about
University-based startups in Bornhorst's apartment over beer.
Bornhorst founded the group initially because he felt there
wasn't a central place for student entrepreneurs to gather and
share ideas, but eventually with help from faculty and a local
real estate company, Bornhorst and the students of MadeVen-
tures became the first class in the TechArb.
Since graduating in 2009, Bornhorst has founded his own
software company, Filament Labs. He's returned to the Uni-
versity since graduating and recently spoke at the Center for
Entrepreneurship's Entrepreneurship Hour Speaker Series.
Bornhorst said he was impressed with both the students he met
after speaking, as well as the progress the University has made
in helpingastudent entrepreneurs.
"I think it's incredible. I think students have access to a ton of
new resources today," he said. "For example, I would never feel
the need to start MadeVentures today based on what I perceive

to be available from the University just since graduating."
While the TechArb has been around campus a long time -
for a startup - the Center for Entrepreneurship is currently
working on a new resource for student entrepreneurs called
MEngage._ _ _
MEngage is a new program that focuses on growing entre-
preneurial programs outside of the University to make the pro-
grams on campus stronger. The two programs will be based out
of Grand Rapids and the Bay Area of California, and both will
work to connect students with successful entrepreneurs who
operate in the same sector. ____
Tom Frank, executive director of the Center for Entrepre-
neurship, characterized the program as "match.com" for entre-
preneurs.
"For me the goal is to match the best talent to the best
advice," Frank said. "I don't mean to oversimplify it, but getting
good advice from someone who knows (and) understands the
business sector you're operating in can make all the difference
in the world in terms of how fast you move forward with your
idea."
Frank added that while both locations have the same mis-
sion, they will do different work based on their locations. The
Grand Rapids hub will revolve around creating more opportu-
nities for students to explore design manufacturing innovation
in the state. Frank said this will include anything from finding"'
more internships to helping students build relationships with
Michigan incubators and accelerators. Furthermore, the Grand
Rapids hub will attempt to create an easier path for students
who want to stay in-state to build their company.
In contrast, the Bay Area hub will focus on long-distance
mentoring between experts in the area, and students in Ann
Arbor. Frank said participants will be using Skype video
screens to help facilitate the relationships and leveraging the
University's expansive alumni network to find mentors.
Both locations of MEngage are set to launch in the first few
months of 2014.
Changes by the leaders and the best
From new events to new CSG committees, entrepreneurship
has infiltrated the minds of the student body.
Many of the most recent student-lead changes can be attrib-
uted to University alum Manish Parikh, former CSG President,
who ran on a platform of promoting entrepreneurship on cam-
pus and followed through on his campaign promise.
During his tenure, CSG dedicated 10 of its 59 executive proj-
ects to the entrepreneurial community, which included the cre-
ation of an entrepreneurship commission.
The commission, which has been renewed for the semester,
is comprised of leaders from student organizations that focus
on entrepreneurship, and aims to shape the University with
the top student-driven entrepreneurial culture in the country.
Since its inception, the commission has worked hard to promote
entrepreneurship on campus, including hosting a "Month of
Entrepreneurship" in March 2013.
The month was a six-week period comprised of over 30
events featuring entrepreneurial topics. It included events like
the inaugural MHacks, which has become one of the largest
student hackathons in the country, and will be hosting its third
hackathon this month. The Month of Entrepreneurship was
well received not only on campus, but also by the Obama admin-
istration. The White House dedicated a blog post to the Uni-
versity's Month of Entrepreneurship, where they interviewed
Parikh about the event as well as growing entrepreneurship oe
campus.
When talking to Parikh on a long-distance phone call from
India, it's hard not to hear the smile in his voice when he talks
about entrepreneurship at the University. While discussing the
entrepreneurship commission, he sounds like a proud parent.
And when it shifts to the White House his tone switches to one
of honor.
See ENTREPRENEURIAL, Page 6B

across the University, from MPowered events to
E ntrepreneurship. These days, it's a buzzword heard
student startups. Entrepreneurial efforts abound us
on campus, but its role at the University is hard to
define. If it can be defined by one trait, it's the ongoing process
of change.
"Change" is a fitting definition for the entrepreneurial cli-
mate on campus - with an increased focus on the topic over the
last year and a half alone. In 2013, there have been two hack-
athons, a "Month of Entrepreneurship" and a newly created
entrepreneurial adviser position. With another hackathon rap-
idly approaching and the Central Student Government's Com-
mission for Entrepreneurship renewed for another semester, it
seems last year's change is only the beginning.
The rising'rock stars of the world'
You may be hearing more about entrepreneurship on cam-
pus, but it's hardly a new concept. It's a spirit politicians say
America was built on, and the increase in entrepreneurship on
campus mirrors a national trend. According to a 2012 Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor reporton the United States, total
entrepreneurial activity is at its highest level since 1999.
Though it's hard to determine exactly when this increasing
trend toward entrepreneurship started, Stewart Thornhill,
executive director of the Zell Lurie Institute for Entrepreneur-
ial Studies, believes it comes from a changing business model in
the United States.
"The current generation of students - whether they're

undergraduate or graduate students - grew up in the period of
time when there was a real loss of faith in the long-term, big-
company employment model that their parents and their par-
ents' parents had gone through," Thornhill said. "There were
all these huge employers which had previously been seen as
very stable forms of employment ... now all (of a) sudden (they)
are not so stable anymore. Your job could literally disappear
overnight."
Apart from the changing business model, Thornhill also
cited increased media coverage, a new social culture and the
desire for people to control their own destiny as reasons for
the growth in entrepreneurship in the United States, and con-
sequently, on campus. Thornhill said "Shark Tank" - an ABC
television show where entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to receive
funding from investors - is a prime example of how entrepre-
neurship is infiltrating popular culture.
"The entrepreneurs are now the rock stars of the world,"
Thornhill said. "They're on TV programs and magazine covers.
So you've got this whole sexiness thing that 20 years ago wasn't
really associated with starting your own business."
Indeed, there are many well known entrepreneurial "rock
stars" nowadays, Mark Zuckerberg being one of the most
famous. Zuckerberg started Facebook in his early 20s while a
student at Harvard University, and has since turned his dorm-
room project into a multi-billion dollar empire - increasing
his personal net worth to $19 billion in the process, according
to Forbes. Engineering junior Chris O'Neil serves as the cur-
rent president of MPowered, an active student entrepreneur-
ial group on campus that seeks to unite and enhance student

startup culture. O'Neil said during his time at the University,
there has been an increase in student entrepreneurial involve-
ment and believes it can partially be attributed to a "Mark Zuck-
erberg effect."
"It's definitely more known than it used to be," O'Neil said.
"Everybody knows that a couple of kids that went to Stanford
started Snapchat, and just got offered $3 billion. ... Whether
you're interested in entrepreneurship or not, you're going to
know about that story. It builds this awareness of entrepreneur-
ship and you can get people thinking."
A student movement
Thomas Zurbuchen, now the senior adviser for entrepre-
neurial education, has spearheaded entrepreneurship on cam-
pus during his time at the University. In 2008, he started the
Center for Entrepreneurship, a resource hub for campus start-
ups and students interested in created new businesses. While
originally exclusive to engineering students, the Center has
since expanded its program availability to most students at the
University.
Zurbuchen said the increase in entrepreneurial opportuni-
ties from the University initially came as a result of increased
student demand, adding that he founded the Center for Entre-
preneurship for the students - not for institutional prestige.
"In many ways I think Michigan entrepreneurship, as
opposed to other schools, is entrepreneurship that has started
bottom-up," Zurbuchen said. "It turns out that students have
taken tremendous ownership of entrepreneurship."

Zurbuchen cited the number of entrepreneurial-minded
clubs on campus as an example of student initiative. MPowered
was one of the first entrepreneurial student groups on campus
when it was founded in 2006, but is now one of 16 listed on the
Center for Entrepreneurship's website and one of almost 50 on
campus, according to Zurbuchen.
While entrepreneurship was primarily pushed by students in
the beginning, Zurbuchen said the current entrepreneurial cli-
mate is beingsupported by both the students and the University
administration.
"What's really interesting about this movement on campus is
that it comes from both directions," Zurbuchen said. "I think it
is a coincidence of sorts that the students see this as absolutely
critically important and something that they can act on, but we
at the University-level see it as absolutely essential and a huge
opportunity for the University to have an impact ... in our state,
and in our future of the U.S., and the world."
Changing an institution
The switch to entrepreneurship overdrive may have been
slow at the University through the lens of the fast-paced startup
world, but for an institution that's turning 200 in three years,
the shift is fairly quick.
Over the course of the last 15 years, the University has seen
large amounts of entrepreneurial growth. Zell Lurie was
founded in 1999, the Center for Entrepreneurship in 2008 and
Zurbuchen's role expanded to help foster entrepreneurship on
campus in 2013.
