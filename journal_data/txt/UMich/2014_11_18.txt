ADMINISTRATION
Regents
to vote
on bldg.
designs
Dennison
renovation project
estimated to cost
$49 million
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily Staff Reporter
At Thursday's meeting of the
University's Board of Regents
the governing body will vote to
approve schematic designs for
a $49 million renovation of the
David M. Dennison Building.
The regents will also con-
sider several other capital
projects, including designs
for the new Biological Sci-
ence Building, renovations for
the second floor of Lorch Hall
and improvements to Yost Ice
Arena.
In July 2014, the board
approved the Dennison proj-
ect and the hiring of Diamond
Schmitt Architects to design
the project. Thursday's vote of
approval will put the project
into action.
If approved, LSA will relo-
cate the International Insti-
tute and associated centers for
international studies from the
School of Social Work to the
Dennison Building after the
renovation is completed.
Approximately 106,000
gross square feet that have
been vacated by the relocation
of the Department of Astrono-
my fromDennisonto West Hall
will be renovated. Classrooms
will be repurposed to create
spaces for faculty work as well

University President Mark Schlissel speaks at his monthly Fireside Chat in the Michigan Union on Monday.
Sc huissel addresses
m--isconduct policy

In monthly fireside
chat, University
president talks
student life issues
By BECKY WEILAND
For theDaily
In the Pond Room of the
Michigan Union, about a dozen
randomly-selected students
from around campus gathered
Monday evening to discuss
issues with University President
Mark Schlissel and E. Royster
Harper, vice president for stu-
dent life, during their monthly
Fireside Chat.
After breaking the ice with
light discussion about his plans
to spend his first Thanksgiv-
ing in Ann Arbor and receiving
Snapchat pictures from one of
his daughters, Schlissel opened

the floor up for questions.
Among a host of questions and
concerns, how the University
handles sexual misconduct was
featured in Schlissel's discussion.
In wake of the recent domes-
tic violence charge involving the
defensive end Frank Clark, stu-
dents expressed issues regarding
sexual assault and current cam-
pus policies. Though Michigan
Coach Brady Hoke announced
Monday that Clark was dis-
missed from the team, the cir-
cumstances surrounding former
kicker Brendan Gibbons' perma-
nent separation from the Uni-
versity for violating the Student
Sexual Misconduct Policy con-
tinue to raise concerns around
campus for how sexual miscon-
duct is handled at the University.
Schlissel acknowledged that
steps are currently being taken
to improve the campus commu-
nity and work toward preventing
sexual misconduct, as well as an

examination of the current rules
and procedures regarding sexual
misconduct. Schlissel noted that
all students - athletes or not
- must be part of the effort to
change the culture on campus to
combat sexual assault.
Throughout the majority of
the chat, manystudents inquired
about the need for renovations
on North Campus, as well as
frustration with the consistency
of northbound buses. With reno-
vations currently underway on
the West Quad-Residence Hall-
and the recent completion of
renovations to East Quad Resi-
dence Hall and South Quad Resi-
dence Hall, students feel North
Campus is being overlooked.
"What I want is for when
students hear that they're on
North Campus is to accept the
inconvenience of it and the luck
of the draw, but also to acknowl-
edge that this is an opportunity

Confidentiality
requirement calls
group's influence
into question
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Online Editor
The University's Advisory
Board on Intercollegiate Athlet-
ics, the only body charged with
providing faculty, student and
alumni input to the Athletic
Department, is restricted by a
wide-ranging confidentiality
and fiduciary agreement with
the department, causing some
faculty members to call into
question the board's indepen-
dence and influence.
The ABIA is established
by the bylaws of the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents and is
designed to serve as an adviser
to the athletic director. It is
also instructed to "make, adopt,
and enforce the necessary rules
1rid- -regedationw" concerning
student-athlete eligibility and
"intercollegiate relations."
"The existing agreement
starts from the premise that all
information acquired in ABIA
is confidential unless explicitly
released," wrote Scott Masten,
chair of the Senate Advisory
Committee on University Affairs
and a professor of business eco-
nomics and public policy, in an
e-mail. The agreement has been

in place since at least 2010.
The confidentiality agree-
merit,whichwas released for the
first time at Monday's meeting
of the University Senate, refers
to ABIA's "fiduciary duties of
loyalty and care."
"Members of the ABIA sign
confidentiality and. fiduciary
agreements because - there
often is confidential informa-
tion shared," Associate Athletic
Director David Ablauf wrote in
an email. "It's important that
ABIA members understand how
seriously the university takes
the protection of that informa-
tion."
By making all discussion con-
fidential by default, the agree-
ment stops members of the
committee from discussing con-
cerns - large or small - with
anyone other than University
President Mark Schlissel. The
current policy requires direct
approval of the athletic direc-
tor, who is chair of the ABIA by
default but lacks a vote, to pub-
1iy discuss issues brought up
duringmeetings.
Ablauf wrote that members
could always bring up issues to
fellow ABIA members, appro-
priate offices at the University or
use the University's compliance
hotline. The agreement itself
does not provide for outside con-
tacts other than the University
president.
Masten and other members
of SACUA are troubled with the

HEALTH
Despite Ebola precautions,
enterovirus D68 proves to
be a more prevalent concern

Symptoms for virus
include respiratory
infection, cold sores
in children, adults
By QUAN NGUYEN
For the Daily
While Ebola might dominate
the front pages of health and
news publications, a different
virus has had a more widespread
impact in Michigan. As of Nov. 7,
90 positive cases of enterovirus
D68 were reported in the state
out of the 139 cases sent to the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention for testing, accord-
ing to Jennifer Smith, public
information officer at the Michi-
gan Department of Community
Health.
This year, the Washtenaw
County Department of Public
Health reported two positive
cases in the county. One patient
is an adult with a history of
asthma and the other is seven-
month-old infant. The season for
EV-D68 typically ends with the
onset of winter.
First discovered in Califor-

nia in 1962, EV-D68 is most
frequently diagnosed during
summer and fall, causing mostly
infants, children and teenag-
ers to suffer symptoms includ-
ing respiratory infection, mouth
sores, diarrhea, vomiting, cold-
like symptoms and wheezing.
Since adult immune systems
havemore exposure to various
kinds of viruses, they are the
least susceptible age group for
enteroviruses.
This year, EV-D68 is a strain
that "came through with spread
that makes the kids quite sick,
especially those with asthma,"
said Dr. Marie Lozon, division
director of pediatric emergency
medicine at C.S. Mott Children's
Hospital.
Lozon said the hospital's
emergency room was full of
patients fighting the virus during
the peak of EV-D68 season.
"We were absolutely cramped
and overwhelmed; the ICU was
packed," she said.
Lozon said her department
witnessed a 20- to 30-per-
cent increase in the number of
daily patient visits as a result of
EV-D68. Staff would see about
70 children in most years, but
this year the hospital received a

record number of visits during
the few weeks when EV-D68 was
the most prevalent.
"We have seen more kids than
we have ever seen before," Lozon
said.
On those days, the hospital
housed about 105 children per
day.
The CDC is current the only
institution that performs the
diagnostic test for EV-D68.
While waiting for test results
to come back, which might take
several days, staff at the Uni-
versity Hospital apply the same
treatment for potentially positive
EV-D68 patients as they would
for patients with rhinovirus. Pre-
liminary test results usually indi-
cate patients as positive for both
enterovirus and rhinovirus.
Though Lozon and her col-
leagues do not know if EV-D68
causes flaccid paralysis - a
symptom that characterizes
polio, another enterovirus-relat-
ed disease - her department saw
a cluster of seven patients of vari-
ous ages and from different parts
of Michigan admitted with flac-
cid paralysis of lower and upper
extremities in a period of a week
and a half.

President Emerita
attended first
meeting last week
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily News Editor
Former University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman has
been appointed to a seat on the
Mayo Clinic's Board of Trustees.
According to a release published
on the clinic's website, Cole-
man attended her first quarterly
meeting of the board Friday.
A biochemist by training,
Coleman holds a doctorate in
biochemistry and professor
emeritus appointments in the
University's Medical School
and LSA. She retired as presi-
dent earlier this year after lead-
ing the University for 12 years.
Her successor, University Pres-
ident Mark Schlissel, is a noted
-5

immunologist who also holds
appointments in the Medical
School and LSA.
Coleman also currently
serves on the boards of pharma-
ceutical company Johnson and
Johnson and the Meredith Cor-
poration, an Iowa-based media
conglomerate - positions she
held during her presidency. In
2009, Johnson and Johnson
paid Coleman $229,978 in cash
and stock and the Meredith
Corporation's compensation
totaled $137,167, according to a
2010 New York Times report.
According to Mayo Clinic
spokesperson Karl W. Oest-
reich, Mayo Clinic public trust-
ees are not compensated for
their service, but do receive
reimbursement for expenses
incurred while traveling to and
from quarterly board meetings.
Trustees also receive supple-
mentary medical insurance for
treatment at Mayo Clinic facili-
5-m

ties that is not covered by pri-
mary insurance policies.
The non-profit Mayo Clinic's
governing body is a 31-member
board composed of both clinical
physicians and administrators
and public representatives. The
trustees are charged with over-
seeing research, medical edu-
cation and patient care at the
organization's sites in Florida,
Arizona and Minnesota.
Public trustees are selected
by a governance and nominat-
ing committee within the Board
of Trustees.
"Trustees are invited based
upon their experience, exper-
tise, and other priority charac-
teristics identified from time
to time by the Governance &
Nominating Committee," Oest-
reich wrote in a statement.
Previous Mayo Clinic trust-
ees include former First Lady
Barbara Bush, former Vice
President Dick Cheney and
presidential candidate Walter
Mondale. Journalist Tom Bro-
kaw currently serves on the
board.
This year, U.S. News and
World Report ranked the Mayo
Clinic the best hospital in the
country. In 2012, the Mayor
Clinic employed more than
61,000 people, saw 1.165 million
patients and presided over $634
million in research funding.

Twelve students
are runnning for
10 open seats
By TANAZ AHMED'
Daily Staff Reporter
Students hoping to become
representatives in the LSA
Student Government came-
together in Palmer Commons
on Monday night for the fall
elections' Candidates' Forum.
The forum provides candi-
dates with the opportunity to
discuss their platforms and
answer questions related to
their ideas.
"While students can read
platforms on the actual vot-
ing website, they can look at
people's Facebook pages, they
can see fliers all around," said
LSA-SG President Natasha
Dabrowski, an LSA senior.
"There wasn't as much of a
forum that we could use for
students interested in the elec-
tions to find out more about the
platforms and ask questions'
because once the voting period
starts, students can answer
questions but they can't pro-

mote themselves."
For the past few years, the
forum has been held during
both the fall and winter semes-
ters. During the fall elections
only student representative
seats are open, while in the
winter elections the president
and vice president positions
are also open.
The event was mandatory
for all candidates. Though the
forum was open to all LSA stu-
dents, the event was not highly
attended.
"We really do hope that more
and more students will engage
through this event and through
other events with representa-
tives so that they're educated in
their voting," Dabrowski said.
This fall, 12 applicants are
vying for nine representative
spots. Ten out of the 12 appli-
cants are LSA freshmen, which
include Carly Berger, Scar-
lett Ong Rui Chern, Nicholas
Fadanelli, Jeremy Glick, Kath-
ryn Graham, Joseph Hansel,
Madison Kelly, Uriel Lee, Elai-
na Rahrig and Alyson Rich.
The remaining two candidates
are LSA sophomores Aditi Rao
and John Steffes.
Student safety and well-

being was a prominent topic
at the forum. Candidates pro-
posed improving the street
lighting on North Campus as
well as increasing the number
of blue safety lights on campus.
To improve student mental
health, candidates suggested
spreading awareness, about
University resources such as
Counseling and Psychologi-
cal Services and University
Health Services. Some candi-
dates discussed placing heat
lamps, which provide vitamin
D, in residence halls to combat
seasonal depression.
Many of the candidates also
focused on the environment
and sustainability on cam-
pus. The implementation of a
zero-waste program at the Big
House to reduce waste was one
of the initiatives discussed.
The polls for the fall elec-
tion will open at midnight on
Nov. 19 and close at 11:59 p.m.
on Nov. 20. The ballot will also
include three questions at the
end to gauge student opinions
on LSA's Race and Ethnicity
requirement, the accessibility
of research on campus and the
implementation of zero-waste
at the Big House.

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Conviction stands
for dad in girl's
disappearance
The Michigan appeals court
has affirmed the murder con-
viction of a Detroit man whose
2-year-old daughter has not been
found.
The court says there was "suf-
ficient circumstantial evidence"
to support D'Andre Lane's
convictions. He was charged
with first-degree child abuse
and murder committed during
another felony.
 Lane claimed Bianca Jones
was abducted during a carjack-
ing in 2011, a tragic story that led
police and volunteers to scour
Detroit's most depressed neigh-
borhoods during the Christmas
season.

City's plan would

Pay phones on New York City
streets would become a thing of

phone calls as well as mobile
phone charging capability.
New York City Mayor Bill

proposed by a group of compa-

the name CityBridge, had been
selected to replace the old pay
phone system. Up to 10,000
column-like devices would
be placed in all five boroughs
starting next year if the plan is
approved by the city's Franchise

Governor activates
National Guard
ahead of ruling

National Guard ahead of a grand

a white police officer will be
charged in the fatal shooting
of a black 18-year-old in the St.

Nixon said the National
Guard would assist state and
local police in case the grand
jury's decision leads to a resur-
gence of the civil unrest that
occurred in the days immedi-
ately after the Aug. 9 shooting
of Michael Brown by Ferguson

police officer Darren Wilson.
"My hope and expectation is
that peace will prevail," Nixon
said. "But we have a responsibil-

plan for any contingencies that
might arise."
VIENNA
U.S. "disappointed"
by Iran's level of
nuclear cooperation
A U.S. envoy says Washing-
ton is disappointed with Iran
over the degree of cooperation it
has shown with the U.N. nucle-
ar agency's attempts to probe
whether Tehran ever worked on
atomic arms.
A report this month from
the U.N.'s International Atomic
Energy Agency said the investi-
 gation has made no headway for
months despite pledges by Ira-
nian leaders to cooperate.
The IAEA has tried to follow
up on the allegations for more
than a decade, with little suc-

Business sophomore Aditi Pad-
manabhan. "Right now they just
view it as a hindrance to what
they want to do. I don't want
students to feel like just because
where they live they're so much
more inconvenienced than
everyone else."
Both Schlissel and Harper
responded to additional con-
cerns regarding Bursley Dining
Hall and other accommodations
with assurances that these reno-
vations are in the planning stag-
es. Harper referred to plans for
North Campus as well as Mary
Markley Residence Hall as the
"third round" of renovations and
the next project in line after the
completion of West Quad.
Following several other con-
cerns raised with this issue,
Schlissel also noted that the
complaints of a vast difference
in food quality between North
andCentral Campus dininghalls
will be examined.
Another issue students
emphasized was underage and
excessive drinking, which stu-
dents said continues to be a
major problem on campus. The
students' concern focused on the
effectiveness of programs and

heightened punishment to mini-
mize risk in situations involving
alcohol.
Harper responded by saying
discussions about diminish-
ing alcohol-related incidents
are constantly occurring - in
addition to the several pro-
grams incorporated into
freshman orientation and
University-sponsored sober
events held throughout the year.
Conversations about gradu-
ally increasing enforcement
for underage drinking are also
underway.
Schlissel was also open to
suggestions from the audience
about controlling alcohol abuse
on campus. The possibility of
parent intervention and target-
ing leaders in student organiza-
tions to promote a safe campus
culture was also discussed.
"A lot of the policing can be
done not from authority figures
that work at the University, but
authority figures within student
organizations like fraternities,
sports teams and clubs," said
Law student Greg Berman. "I
think that sort of policing and
prevention can be more effective
for students that look up to and
value the opinions of the upper-
classmen that they interact with
ona regular basis."
Schlissel's next Fireside Chat
is scheduled for Dec. 8.

ENTEROVIRUS
From Page1
As flu season approaches, this
situation makes it more difficult
for experts to accurately detect
the cause of respiratory illness
since EV-D68 and influenza
share similar symptoms.
Arnold Monto, a professor of
epidemiology at the University's
School of Public Health, noted
the difficulty in learning about
EV-D68. His team is planning
on tracking individuals with
mild symptoms of EV-D68, but
according to Monto, it is difficult

to do so because EV-D68 is a sea-
sonal virus.
He emphasized the impor-
tance of developing a faster.
diagnostic test for EV-D68.
Developing a faster way to detect
the enterovirus similar to the
way potential flu cases are tested
would aid Monto and his col-
leagues in learning about the
spread of EV-D68.
According to the CDC, there
were 1,116 confirmed positively
tested cases of EV-D68 from mid-
August to Nov.12, 2014, across 47
states and the District of Colum-
bia. Twelve patients have died
from EV-D68, including one in

Michigan. As of Nov. 13, the CDC
has removed its EV-D68-like
illness activity map due to the
reduction in reported cases for
the virus as well as the difficulty
in attributing instances of respi-
ratory illness in the winter to
EV-D68 or influenza.
Similar to recommendations
designed to minimize influenza,
the CDC, along with state and
local governments, continues to
emphasize good hand hygiene in
schools and at homes as aprecau-
tionary measure. They are also
advising parents to seek medical
attention if their child experi-
ences any difficultyinbreathing.



AGREEMENT
From Page1
current agreement's wide-rang-
inglanguage and said it prevents
important or relevant informa-
tion from reaching the public
and faculty. They also pointed to
recent scandals at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
and Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity, where many have blamed
lax athletics oversight for allow-
ing transgressions.
He added that he initially saw
the agreement earlier this year
when he became part of ABIA
as one of his duties as chair of
SACUA. The chair of SACUA
serves on ABIA, per the regents'
bylaws. He has not signed the
agreement but has been able to
attend ABIA meetings, while
negotiations on a new agree-
ment are continuing.
In similar committees, such
as the Board of Regents or
SACUA, information discussed
is deemed public unless spe-
cifically qualified as private
through a vote. The confiden-
tiality agreement for ABIA
members takes the opposite
approach.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald wrote in an e-mail
that other other groups such as
executive search committees
also use confidentiality agree-
ments. Members of the Chief
Financial Officer search com-
mittee were asked to sign a copy
of the group's charge which asks
members to "maintain confiden-
tiality as directed."
Masten and members of
SACUA raised concerns with the
University's Office of the Gener-
al Counsel, asking if the agree-
ment violated ABIA's mandate
outlined in the regents' bylaws.

The bylaws state, "At any time,
the Advisory Board may consult
with the University Senate."
"Both I and SACUA object-
ed to the agreement as being
excessively broad and restric-
tive, as well as to the fiduciary
language" Masten wrote. "We
also felt that it conflicted with
the spirit of the regents' Bylaws,
which provide for consultation
between ABIA and SACUA and
the Senate Assembly."
A legal memo from the Gen-
eral Counsel's office, according
to Masten, argued that since
ABIA is not actually required
to consult with the University
Senate, the agreement does not
violate the exact wording of
the regents' mandate. The Uni-
versity declined to provide the
memo.
There has been pushback-
within some parts of the Univer-
sity for changing the agreement.
"Initially, the General Coun-
sel told (Masten) that they
would revise the agreement, but
within hours informed (Masten)
that there was 'resistance' to
changing the agreement," state
SACUAs minutes for Sept. 29,
2014.
Masten and other members
of SACUA have been working
for several weeks on negotiat-
ing, writing and editing a new
agreement, which was approved
by SACUA.
This new agreement stands
in contrast to the current agree-
ment. The proposed confiden-
tiality agreement states most
things are non-confidential by
default, unless ABIA votes for
an executive session. All "fidu-
ciary" language was removed.
The proposed agreement was
recently sent to the General
Counsel's office and SACUA is
awaiting a response.

The Washtenaw County Office
of Community and Economic
Development formed a response
workgroup followinglast winter's
extreme weather conditions and
the subsequentcalls for moreshel-

homeless.
The group began meeting dur-
ing the summer months, publicly
asking in August for any local
facilities willing to provide shel-
ter duringthe 2015winter season.
The committee announced in
August that it had already deter-
mined a plan for staffing the loca-
tion, but had yet to determine a
proper place to hold the shelter.
The workgroup formed follow-
ing public concerns surrounding
the availability of shelters during

especially at night when daytime
warmingstations are closed.
Yousef Rabhi, chair of the
Washtenaw County Board of
Commissioners, said he will also
be supporting an increase in the
funds designated for the Delonis
Center.
The Nov. 7 Council meeting

office regarding the committee's
findings and an initial discussion
of the city's plan for expanding
shelter offerings this winter.
The Delonis Center was sched-

Another resolution, which was
added to the agenda at the meet-
ing and provided for re-opening
the affordable housing site Burton
Commons, passed unanimously as
well.
Resolution to approve Fuller
Park parking lot land lease
with the University
The Council passed a reso-
lution to alter the duration of

the current lease held with the
University for their use of the
parking lots on Fuller Road
from two years with an option
for a two-year extension to one
year with aone-year extension.
Discussion included two
rounds of amendments, the
first proposed by Councilmem-
ber Jack Eaton (D-Ward 4),
that would change the lease
to expire after one year, offer-,
ing the University a one-year
extension if it chose to con-
tinue leasing the property. The
second amendment, proposed
by Councilmember Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3), would
have changed the lease to be
one year in duration without
any option to continue the lease
for another year. This amend-
ment did not pass, and instead
councilmembers voted unani-
mously to pass the resolution
with Eaton's amendments.
"I would like to see this ter-
minated, but not abruptly,"
Eaton said. "This gives us time
to look at what we would like
to do with this property, and
whether we want to provide
the University parking. This
gives them time to devise a
parking management plan."
Eaton wrote in an e-mail cor-
respondence with Jim Koste-
va, the University's director
of community relations, that
Kosteva found this amendment
of the lease from two years to
one year agreeable.
Taylor, who was in support
of the one-year lease, said it is
important for the city to main-
tain a strong relationship with
the University, adding that this
is the first step in addressing a
larger parking problem.
"Shortening this lease from
two and two to one and one
increases uncertainty," Taylor
said. "I am willing to support
it because I want one and one
more than zero and zero. I will
say that I don't see this as one
and done; I am certain that
there is an alliance of interest

here given the history of park-
ing problems in this area."
The city leases parkingspace
to the University, which is used
by its staff. This lease includes
three parking lots, one of which
has been leased to the Univer-
sity since 1993. The Fuller lot's
original lease expired Aug. 31.
This resolution has been
presented to the Council three
times, once in August, once in
October and once at the Nov.
7 meeting, but a decision was
postponed each time. Public
commentary and councilmem-
ber discussion have indicated
the delay in renewing the lease
stems from the possibility of
the city using the area as the
site of its future train station.
The Parks Advisory Com-
mission's recommendation
to the Council said the lease
amount to be paid by the Uni-
versity will not increase this
year because the University
leases overflow Argo Canoe
Livery parking to the city at
no charge, but the Council
will consider increasing this
amount in the future. Council-
member Julie Grand (D-Ward
3) said she was hesitant to
remove the option of extend-
ing the lease by a year because
of the free parking provided by
the University.
"We don't often hear about
amicable or good relationships
with the University, so for me
this is a perfect example of our
cooperation," Grand said. "And
you know, when times were
hard, the money from this lease
kept facilities open. So though
this money may be small, it
does matter to the park's bud-
get. The relationship that was
established between the park
and the University has provid-
ed for the city's use of 100 free
parking spots.
There have been multiple
locations under consideration
for a new train station, with the
Fuller Park location being one
of three.

as graduate and undergraduate
student collaboration.
The renovation is also
expected to add 1,500 gross
square feet of space to the
building by enclosing an over-
hang area on the first floor and
extending windows outward on
the 10th floor. This will create a
10-story high-rise section of the
building.
The estimated $49 million
project will be funded entirely
by LSA resources and invest-
ment proceeds. Scheduled con-
struction will be completed in
the summer of 2017.
Approved last winter, the
new Biological Science Building
will be built adjacent to the Life
Sciences Institute on the site of
the historic North Hall and the
Museums Annex, both of which
will be demolished.
The building is expected to
cost $261 million, funded by
LSA and Office of the Provost
resources. From that total, $9
million is earmarked for the
demolition of North Hall and
the Museums Annex.
Currently, the Kraus Natu-
ral Science Building, built
in 1915, houses the Depart-

ment of Molecular, Cellular
and Developmental Biology
and the Department of Ecol-
ogy and Evolutionary Biology.
This building has reached its
capacity for the current number
of researchers it can support
and is limited in its ability to
allow contemporary research,
according to the project pro-
posal. The two departments
will eventually relocate to the
new building.
The Ruthven Museums
Building houses an additional
part of EEB and the Anthropol-
ogy, Natural History, Paleon-
tology and Zoology museums.
These museums, along with a
portion of Herbarium speci-
mens and dry collections, will
transfer to the new building.
The facility will include new
research laboratories, active
learning classrooms with group
tables instead of auditorium-
esque seating, offices and the
four museum collections. The
laboratories will be construct-
ed in an open plan to allow for
increased collaboration.
The project will also build a
connector from the new build-
ing to the Life Sciences Insti-
tute.
Both the EEB and MCDB are
slated to complete their reloca-
tion to the new facility by 2019.

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -
President Juan Manuel Santos
demanded Colombia's larg-
est rebel group demonstrate
its commitment to peace and
immediately release an army
general it captured Sunday, say-
ing the resumption of suspend-
ed talks to end the half-century
conflict depend on it.
Santos addressed the nation
Monday night little more than
24 hours after Gen. Ruben
Dario Alzate, dressed in civilian
clothes, was snatched by gun-
men alongwithtwootherswhile
visiting a hamlet along a remote
river in western Colombia. A
soldier who managed to flee in
the group's boat, and reportedly
had advised the general against
traveling deep into the jungle,
said the rebels belonged to the
recalcitrant 34th Front of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC.
It's the first time thatthe guer-
rillas have taken an army general
captive and couldn't have come at
a worse moment for Santos.
Even before Santos suspend-
ed two-year-old peace talks,
frustration with the slow prog-
ress and the guerrillas' refusal
to wind down attacks had been
building. Earlier this month,
the FARC captured two sol-
diers during intense fighting in
northeast Colombia and killed
two Indians who confronted
rebels hanging up revolution-
ary banners on their reserva-
tion. It has since offered to free
the soldiers.

Calling Alzate's abduction
"totally unacceptable," San-
tos ordered government peace
negotiators not to travel Mon-
day to Cuba as planned for the
next round of peace talks until
Alzate and the two others - an
army captain and a female law-
yer advisingthe army on a rural

energy project - are freed.
"The FARC have to under-
stand that, although we're
negotiating in the middle of
the conflict, peace doesn't
come by resorting to violence
and undermining confidence,"
Santos said Monday night in a
5-minute, televised address.

Innovative learning
The U's inventive teaching methods aid student development
lthough many see the arts and sciences as separate
entities with different learning processes, the University
is currently working to innovate both disciplines through
grants that will promote engaged and interactive learning. The
University of Michigan Museum of Art recently received a $1
million endowment from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in an
effort to promote further integration of museum collections into
academic endeavors. Researching Evidence Based Undergraduate
Instructional and Learning Developments, a group of faculty
members who have started to reform the way STEM courses are
taught, has also received a $2 million grant from the National
Science Foundation. Both developments demonstrate initiative
to improve education through experiential learning that
would greatly benefit the University's student population. This
commitment to engaged learning will allow the student body
to reap the benefits that the University has to offer through a
comprehensive education across the disciplines. However, the
University should continue to develop new ways to incorporate
these multidisciplinary instructional methods.

Caught being Black

C onfronted. Attacked.
These two words are not
synonymous, and have
very different
definitions and "
connotations.
On Nov. 9,
Aura Rosser'
was shot in her
home. She was
a 40-year-old
mother of three, ;
a committed E
partner to her RE NE
boyfriend. And PASQUINELLI
she was Black.
She was in the
midst of an argument with her boy-
friend, and her boyfriend called the
police with the intention of having
the authorities escort her out of the
house. The police reportedly entered
the home, saw Rosser with a knife in
her kitchen, and shot her. Rosser's
boyfriend, Victor Stephens, claims
that lethal force was unwarranted in
this situation; "Why would you kill
her? It was a woman with a knife. It
doesn't make sense."
In the various news articles
reportingRosser's shooting, the word
"confronted" is used to describe her
activity before the shooting. These
descriptions have not made it easy
to interpret what that word means in
this context, but the fact of the matter
is that "confrontation" isn't usually a
word used to describe a life-threat-
ening situation. Police are authorized
to carry out lethal action when their
lives are at risk, but it is hard to tell if
this was the case. The use of the word
"confrontation" and no other word
has made me skeptical of the neces-
sity of the two policemen's actions.
The officers who responded to the
call made by Stephens have been
taken off their usual duties of active
road control due to their actions that
evening. A full investigation will
determine the future of the status of
their positions.

The UMMA grant will be used in multiple
ways, all of which are aimed at integrating
the museum collections into the learning
experience. The grant will fund two new
positions, an academic coordinator and a
collections assistant. Of the $1 million received
from the grant, $750,000 will go toward
the creation of the academic coordinator,
responsible for managing UMMA collections
andintegratingmuseumexhibits into abroader
range of courses and more student research
projects. This is a long-term investment in
multidisciplinary exploration at the University.
The use of this grant will serve as an example
of opportunity to utilize overlooked resources
in order to innovate learning across disciplines.
The $2 million NSF grant will be used to
fund the work of a group of faculty members
working on the REBUILD project that focuses
on experimentation and data collection of
student success in STEM classes. REBUILD
is based on the need to explore different
teaching methods in order to keep up with the
digital advancements of the academic world
through methods such as the use of "real-
life" research experience, online tournament-
style homework and video enhancement of
resources already available online. Research
conducted by REBUILD has shown that
active learning has many educational benefits.
It also points to improvement in professor
instruction when student success data is
gathered from one generation of students
to the next. Although this experimentation
is necessary to improve the effectiveness of
STEM courses at the University, necessary
trial and error might put current students at a
disadvantage academically.
Efforts to innovate learning have proven
successfulboth at the University and elsewhere.
For example, Laura Olsen, a professor of
molecular, cellular and developmental
biology, has changed her teaching style from
a traditional form to a "flipped course" style,

in which students are responsible for reading
material before class so that time in lecture
can be spent working through problems.
Similarly, Lehigh University in Pennsylvania
has implemented its Mountaintop Program,
which allows students to create their own
hands-on project proposals, which are
carried out in a free-form way that allows for
student-led exploration. This initiative follows
educational studies that suggest that student-
led projects not only help students to better
retain knowledge, but also cultivate-innovation
that they can use to foster future success.
Furthermore, Northeastern University's
acclaimed co-op program - in which students
are placed in semester-long experiential
learning environments such as internships,
research or study abroad opportunities - has
proven to cultivate a greater sense of motivation
and purpose in learning.
The ability to provide students with
alternative learning options often hinges on
access to resources, something in abundance
at the University. Underutilized libraries
such as the William L. Clements and Bentley
Historical libraries, which house a wealth of
pre-20th-century original documents and
maps, could be used to more actively engage
students in the humanities and social science
fields. The audio and video-editing studios,
located in North Campus's Duderstadt
Center, provide a platform for all students to
develop audio-visual skills that can be used
to supplement any academic pursuit. The
University also houses a 3-D printing lab
with student access, allowing STEM students
to keep up with technological advances
in their fields. The innovative use of the
recently received STEM and arts grants are a
step in the right direction, putting into place
innovative programs. This more wholesome
and well-rounded way of educating will help
students engage at the University, and thus
engage with the world at large.

A s we sink into the deep
depression that signals the
impending doom of winter,
we search for
ways to make'
ourselves warm
again, inside and
out. People turn
on the Christmas "
music way too
early and pull
out their favorite
sweaters with the
hope that these MAURA
small efforts LEVINE
will stave off the
inevitable arctic
chill. But in Washington, D.C., I've
noticed a new and different method
of keeping warm - the community.
Here, people have relied on other
people in ways that I have never
before noticed in Ann Arbor and, as
students, we could learn a thing or
two from this metropolitan territory
with Midwest kindness.
In D.C. there aren't many places to
study. Our Michigan in Washington
cohort ends up studying in makeshift
study lounges, which are really aban-
doned classrooms in our dorm or in
the ever-present Starbucks. In Ann
Arbor, at any coffee shop all you can
see are students typing away at their
computers, dark circles encompass-
ingtheir eyes as they scratch furious-
ly at the keys, hoping their final paper
will suffice. They hardly look up, too
engrossed in texting their friends
about plans for the evening and blast-
ing the electronic dance music that
will help them make it through the
homework pain.
In D.C., however, the vibe is dif-
ferent. No longer on campus, there
are people of all ages and all colors
and sizes at Starbucks. There is a
communal bar table in the middle of
the shop filled with singles reading
newspapers, families with babies,
30-year-olds eating sandwiches and'
little old men drinking espresso.
Less than half of the people are
plugged into a device and I feel like
an outsider for doing so. There's a
woman with her architecture draw-
ings spread out on a shorter table and
right next to her a stranger reads the
newspaper. Two old men who are
apparently complete strangers strike
up a conversation. One tells the other
about his upcoming trip to South
America and the latter launches
into a story about his world travels.

th an epidemic
of sexual assault
V sweeping college
campuses across
the nation,
including the
University of
Michigan, there
are countless
topics of
uncertainty and
controversy. In a
four-part series, JAMES
James Brennan ENNAN
seeks to explore
them with
interviews and
personal research. This is part four.
Trigger warning: The following
article includes descriptions of sex-
ual assault and may be triggering.
"What do you think causes
sexual assault?"
I tried to end every interview
over the last month by asking that
question in some way, shape or
form. I asked as many people as
I could in search of an answer. I
didn't think I would find a silver
bullet, nor did I.
"Alcohol" or "binge drink-
ing" was by far the most popu-
lar answer from students, but
also the least convincing. Meg
Scribner, an LSA senior writ-
ing her thesis on the Violence
Against Women Act, saw alco-
hol as a "facilitator perhaps, but
not a cause" of sexual assault.
For Scribner, sexual assault
is a symptom of much larger
societal problems involving
oppressive, gendered power
dynamics. In her words, "sexual
assault is just one iteration of
masculinism in an inherently
sexist culture."
Business senior Sumana Palle
called sexual assault a product of
male entitlement, coming out of
a system where men think they
can have whatever they want. On
campus and throughout the coun-
try, she told me, this is reinforced
by "a system of no consequences"
where assaulters typically get
off scot-free.
Sexual assault is not only per-
petrated by men, nor is it only
perpetrated upon women. How-
ever, it would be naive to ignore
the reality that assault is primar-
ily committed by men, and equally
as naive to pretend that gender
inequality and sexism have noth-
ing to do with this. Control, power,
domination - these are all terms
associated with masculinity. In
evaluating the "It's on Us" cam-
paign, Scribner saw it as a repro-
duction of the same masculinity
behind sexual abuse. Instead of
dominating women through vio-
lence, however, the campaign
looks to dominate through a
masculine mindset of we have to
protect these women. Palle drew
similar parallels between certain
masculine traits and "It's on Us,"
especially attempts to turn the
campaign into a competition with
Ohio State.
In a viewpoint in The Michi-
gan Daily, Palle wrote, "people
apparently missed the obvious
irony of using the very spirit of
competitive football culture that
enabled the mishandling of the
Brendan Gibbons case to combat
sexual assault."
On Oct. 29, shortly after my

interview with Palle, students
poured into the Diag carrying
mattresses, stopping to surround
an anonymously written list of
demands. Throughout the day, the
Diag remained filled with people.
1000 Pitches was having a Diag
day, as were the College Repub-
licans and a few human rights
groups - but the focus was on
those demands, where students
crowded around each other to see
what was there.
Tucked away between two
trees on the west side of the Diag
hung a yellow banner, advertising
the previous week's "Maize Night
Madness" rally before the Michi-
gan State game, likely the last
time the Diag had been so popu-
lated. Three weeks before that,
the Diag was similarly packed, as
hundreds of students rallied to
demand Dave Brandon resign as
Athletic Director.
Public Policy senior Craig
Kaplan (who is a close friend and
former roommate) made a point
to include the Gibbons debacle as
one of Brandon's fireable offens-
es in both his speech at the rally
and in numerous public state-
ments. Most students, however,
r appeared more concerned with
the football team's embarrass-
ing record and corporatization.
A student-created petition gath-
ered over 1t,000 signatures in a
matter of a few days, about half of

Catharsis
which were from students. That's
1,000 more than the overall goal
for the "It's on Us" petition and
pledge drive.
Two weeks ago, Ihad the privi-
lege of seeing Pulitzer Prize-win-
ning author and human rights
activist Alice Walker speak at
Hill Auditorium. Walker focused
on the topic of friendship, but
the true core of her lecture was
empathy. Empathy for everyone,
from the poor and disenfran-
chised, to the awful people who
disenfranchised them and made
them poor. It is through empa-
thy that we learn to accept and
understand different people;
without it, we ignore the lives of
others and act only for ourselves.
Like sexual assault, ignorance
and selfishness are at crisis lev-
els in America. A person com-
mitting sexual assault, from an
act of unsolicited groping to first
degree rape, is a physical mani-
festation of lacking empathy. It
is an act of pure self interest, one
done without consideration or
care for the thoughts and feelings
of another human being.
One night my sophomore year,
I was drinking with some friends
in my former fraternity, talking
about women. One friend had
just hooked up with an (insert
ethnicity here) woman for the
first time, and the discussion
turned into an exchange of who
had been with different "types"
of women.
"If you could be with any kind
of girl you haven't," one friend
began, "what would it be?"
"Black chick" another friend
responded instantaneously, "def-
initely a Black chick."
His comment, especially the
immediacy of his response, sent
a disgusted chill through my
body. It brought to mind planta-
tion owners rapingslaves and the
sexual terror reigned on South-
ern black women. I thought of
Ida Mae Holland and the vio-
lent, racialized desires of men
in Mississippi. We were talk-
ing about women like they were
trading cards and comparing
our collections
I say webecause I am not free
from responsibility here.
I honestly can't remember if I
threw in my own list, but I never
pushed back on the conversation.
I didn't say "Guys, we're being
incredibly sexist as well as rac-
ist." Nor did I posit that we all
take a step back and examine our
own privilege in the situation. I
could have, but I didn't.
During the 'Fire Dave Bran-
don' rally, a student in the crowd
yelled "How about we protest
something that matters, like
institutional racism?" He was
met with loud boos. At the rally,
the same thought was going
through my head, but I didn't
want to be "that guy." When
I was sitting around with my
friends evaluating women based
on looks and ethnicity, I stayed
quiet for the same reason.
Empathy, while often seen
as trying to examine others,
requires about just as much prob-

ing of one's self. That's what
makes empathy such a challenge
- we have to be willing to accept
that the way we see the world
might be wrong. We also have to
accept that there are situations in
which we cannot empathize, as
sometimes we just can't fit into
another person's shoes. But the
only way we can know is if we try.
A lot of people aren't trying.
In her op-ed, Palle wrote that
she had stopped excusing poor
treatment of minority students
as a product of ignorance rather
than cruelty. Cruelty, she told
me, is often caused by ignorance
- willful ignorance, however, is
an act of willful cruelty. Failing
to empathize is something we all
do, probably every day, but refus-
al to try is a Cardinal Sin.
Most of the survivors I spoke
with said their assaulters have
acted like nothing wrong hap-
pened or just plain didn't care.
Some accused the women of
"crying rape." It's hard to under-
stand the thought process that
leads to such selfish behavior,
especially in situations that
involve violent assault.
But we have to try to put those
shoes on, too.
Empathy is a powerful force.
It allows us to comprehend why
our fellow human beings do ter-
rible things, thus giving us the
tools to stop them. If we are
ever to understand the real root
causes of sexual assault and

rape, we must understand those
who do it and the factors that
motivate them.
Why an assaulter wants sex,
or what they really want, is a
potentially far more complex
question than any other I've
asked. I would be willing to bet
its root causes largely dimin-
ish a person's understanding of
others. Many sexually violent
people were abused themselves,
often as children. Others feel
personally inadequate, and see
sex as an answer to their own
stinging insecurity; this can
manifest itself in both a desire
for intimate love, which they
mistakenly equate with sex, or
a desire for approval from those
around them.
I want to see sexual violence
seriously diminished in my
lifetime, and that isn't going to
happen by jailing and expel-
ling rapists while we change
our Facebook pictures and push
hashtags. We can, and should, do
awareness and punitive justice
work as well. Brady Hoke's deci-
sion to dismiss senior defensive
end Frank Clark for domestic
violence charges - if he has as
much information as he claims
- is a good example. But we have
to focus mainly on this crisis of
empathy, from an unwilling-
ness to empathize with survi-
vors to an inability to empathize
with perpetrators.
Better education is a good
start, but expanding empathy is
going to mean a hard rewiring of
our institutions, our culture, and
ourselves. Here's a simple way
to get started, a strategy I found
very useful over the past month:
When people who are differ-
ent from you start to talk, listen.
I began researching sexual
assault looking to write a single
column. But then I interviewed
Sumana Palle.
I had interviewed a half dozen
students when Sumana's view-
point came out, and it hit me like
a ton of bricks that my sources up
to that point were overwhelm-
ingly white and straight. So I
reached out to Sumana, and we
met on a mild, sunny afternoon
outside of Espresso Royale on
South University Avenue.
Having done some research
ahead of time, I went into the
interview incredibly nervous.
She had written pieces for the
Daily with impressive style and
vigor, was an activist through
prominent student organiza-
tions, and was a pre-admit to the
Business School. Sumana is also
a survivor of numerous assaults,
and they seem to have only made
her voice stronger.
This was a person who could
tear me in half without even try-
ing. But she didn't.
Palle, like so many of the sur-
vivors and allies I've met over
the past month, had a commit-
ment to empathy and open-
mindedness far surpassing my
own. She answered my questions
openly and honestly, showcas-
ing the frustration I had read
in her article, as well as a genu-
ine love for other students. She
detailed the circumstances of her
assaults as well, which I hesitate
to call assaults only because they

deserve to be called rape.
"You never forget that feel-
ing of screaming on a bathroom
floor" she told me, describing the
second of her three rapes.
As we talked, it became
increasingly apparent that I had
so much more to learn. We con-
tinued the interview for almost
an hour, and as we began to
wrap up, it was hitting me that
if I was going to write about
sexual assault, I had to do it
right. This woman, and so many
others like her, had shown tre-
mendous strength in sharing her
story and continuing to thrive in
all other aspects of life. Just as
importantly, she had shattered
my own misconceptions about
how a social-justice-warrior-
feminist-of-color would treat a
white, former frat boy. When I
told her about my friends dis-
cussing "types" of women, she
sincerely thanked me for my will-
ingness to share it and recognize
its privilege.
As we finished the interview
and began gathering our things,
we chatted about other campus
issues and how I saw my writing
playing out. She wished me luck,
and without hesitation, gave me a
hug goodbye.

Fashion as art

've been inspired by
everything lately. I find my
eyes lingering on a wall of
graffiti I've passed countless times
before, on tile patterns on ceilings
or floors, on
paintings
in UMMA.
However,
there's one
medium that I
find on my mind
for hours and
inspires me in KATHLEEN
my everyday DAVIS
choices: fashion.
If you're an
Ann Arbor resident, unless your
home is a below-ground hole,
you've undoubtedly been exposed
tothe people-watchingthis city
has to offer. I urge everyone
reading this to find some time
in their schedules every week
to sit at the window of Lab Cafd
or Starbucks and just look at the
people who walk by. You'll see
some old men in suits, probably
a few bums, but the longer you
linger, the more you'll notice
the small quirks in a person's
appearance that will give you a
hint of the person they are.
Art is how an individual
expresses themselves through
a medium, an extension of the
creative process in their minds.
This medium can be traditional,
like marble or a canvas, or
contemporary, like performance
art or installation.

Whether conscious or not, the
clothes we put on our bodies are
the simplest display of creativity
we can express with materials we
already have in our closets. We can
put on something nice and let the
world know that we feel important
today; we can accessorize with
jewelryor watchesinabeautiful
combination; we can wear
sweatpants and a pullover and
tell the world that we're tired of
its shit and are trying our best
to get through the day. None of
these options are less expressive
than the others, they just express
different sentiments.
The intersection of art and
clothing is perhaps most apparent
in the world of high fashion.
Artist collaborations in fashion
have been relevant and profitable
for ages, and often become iconic
pieces of history for an aficionado
in either sect.
There have been innumerable
designer collections that have
found inspiration from art and
art that finds inspiration from the
runway, so much so that it becomes,
difficult to distinguish between
which is which. Take the case of
Jean-Michel Basquiat, a prolific
1980s contemporary artist who
became a style icon in his own
right. Basquiat, with his striking
features and towering stance,
modeled in shows for emerging
fashion houses like Comme des
Garcons and had a signature style
that helped fuel his fame until

his death at27. Since his passing,
Basquiat's signature artistic style
has inspired high-top sneakers, a
collaboration between UNIQLO
and MoMA and as of late a
Forever 21collection that features
the artist's signature prints on
inexpensive T-shirts for the
Lollapalooza crowd.
We're certainly not all
Basquiats, and while we may not
have the ability to control the
path ofrunway shows we can
still be influenced by them. Art is
supposed to move and inspire us.
We're supposed to look at a piece,
whether 400 years old or just four,
and feel something inside of us, a
passion that starts in our bellies
and grows into inspiration for
our own artistry.
Even for the artistically
uninclined (like myself), we can
all be artists every morning when
we wake up. We can look in the
mirror and say, how do I want to
express myself today? Who do I
want to be today? Most of us fall
into the same general style day
after day, a look that makes us
feel comfortable, which either
contrasts or pulls from the people
we associate with day after day.
Our bodies are the canvases, our
minds are the mediums and our
outfits are the finished products.
We are all art in motion.
Davis is an artist, despite
what she says. To commend her,

orde's 'Mockingjay'

ByGIBSONJOHNS
DailyArts Writer
For the soundtrack to The
Hunger Games: Mockingjay -Part1,
the third of four "Hunger Games"
films, Lorde
became A
the album's
official The Hunger
"curator." Games:
Now what
does that MoCkingay
mean, Part 1
exactly?
Basically, Original Motion
Lorde Picture Soundtrack
volunteered Various Artists
as tribute to Republic
put together
this impressive 14-track set that
features more than a handful of
music's most important newcomers
from the past year or so: HAIM,
Tinashe, CHRCHES, Tove Lo,
Charli XCX and Lorde herself, just
to name afew.
The previous "Hunger Games"
soundtracks created their own sort
of genre, not unlike Lorde's own
work. Blurring the lines between
different classes of music, the
previous two LPs similarly enlisted
some of music's hottest acts and
encouraged them to use their
signature styles to create songs
that embodied the themes and
sensibilities of the dystopian series.
Though each of the previous two
soundtracks had bright moments,
neither completely came together
as a cohesive set of music that
fully illustrated the film's ideas.
However, with Lorde at the helm
presenting a singular purpose for
the album, Mockingjay - Part 1
does exactly what those other two
soundtracks couldn't, and it's a
hauntinglyexcitingeffort.
The story of "Mockingjay"
is one of revolution and revolt,
of Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss
Everdeen and her struggle to
embrace the pressures hoisted
upon her by the people she's
fighting for. It's clear that Lorde
deliberately made sure the film's
soundtrack was laced vith these
themes. On "Yellow Flicker Beat,"
one of the soundtrack's singles,
she essentially takes on the voice
of Everdeen as she croons, "They
used to shout my name, now they
whisper it." The track is classic
Lorde - eerie and introspective
verses paired with a booming
chorus.
"Dead Air" embodies
everything that one can expect
from a CHVRCHES song: Lauren
Mayberry's joyously high-pitched
vocals over abumping, synth-heavy
beat. The song's lyrics present
something a little different, though,
taking on the mentality of Panem's
revolution: "They're holding us to
an idea / And we're fighting what
we can't see." The artists weave an

Cinematography on some Renaissance painting ish.

underlying frustration throughout
the album - Lorde may represent
Katniss Everdeen as the pot-
stirring symbol of a nation's revolt,
but the other artists represent the
collective peoplethe chantingbody
of the revolution.
These chants are evident
everywhere. One ,of the set's
strongest tracks, "All My Love"
is an explosive collaboration
between Ariana Grande and Major
Lazer. Grande's angelic vocals
soar over Lazer's gritty whopper
of a beat and underlying tribal
chants. The album's opening track,
"Meltdown,"isanotherunexpected
collaboration between Stromae,
Pusha-T, Q-Tip, Lorde and HAIM.
It's an odd track that somehow all
comes together, combining Pusha-
T's mind-numbingly fast verse,
Lorde's crooning and chanting
by an anonymous mob of people.
By the time HAIM comes in for
the last minute with its signature
harmonies, the track becomes
downright epic, capable of
instigating a revolution of its own.
There are also mellower
moments here that prove to be just
as effective in telling"Mockingjay"
's story. Charlie XCX temporarily
abandons her aggressive, anthemic
pop sound on "Kingdom," a
twinkling piano and violin-driven
ballad featuring vocals from Duran
Duran's Simon Le Bon. The song
seems to paint the glossy, utopian
image that the Capitol wants to
uphold, but as sounds of static and
percussion seep in, it becomes clear
that the image is tainted, capable
of being overturned. Kanye West
also hops in, reworking "Yellow
Flicker Beat" with "Flicker," into
chilling, sparsely produced versions
of Lorde's track that holds up just as
well as the original.
At times, though, this effect
creates songs that don't totally
take off. Raury's "Lost Souls,"
which clocks in at just under
three minutes, builds nicely over
a heartbeat-esque backing and a
string ensemble, yet never really
goes anywhere. His spoken-word
verses channel a combination
of Pharrell and Miguel, but, as
a whole, it feels uneventful and
flat. On "Plan the Escape," Bat
for Lashes goes for a similar vibe
over a vaguely pulsating bassline
and glimmering windchimes
and, likewise, produces a track

that gets buried under the weight
of everything else on the album.
These songs fit into the general
framework of Mockingjay but,
at the same time, fail to establish
themselves as necessary parts of
the album's whole.
Perhaps the most notable
contributor to Mockingjay is the
legendary Grace Jones. What Jones
delivers here with "Original Beast"
is the kind of over-the-top, exciting
track one would expect from a
Grace Jones concoction. Though
it's original in its mixture of tribal
drums and animal sounds, it feels
almost criminally out of place to
the point where it comes off as self-
indulgent.Itallbutruinstheflowof
the album and sticks out as the one
song that simply doesn't belong.
Regardless of the slight misfires,
the real winner here is Lorde. She
has put together a phenomenal
assemblage of tracks by artists
who have, for the most part, just
recently proved their worth in the
music scene. The set closes with
Lorde's interpretation of the Bright
Eyes track "Ladder Song." Over a
simple church organ, Lorde sings
lyrics that seem chillingly in-line
with the rest of the album's subject
matter: "We'll welcome a new age
/ Covered in warrior paint." By
the end of "Mockingjay - Part 1,"
Katniss Everdeen will presumably
be prepared to embrace her new
role as the leader of Panem's revolt.
Like Lorde on "Ladder Song," she'll
be covered in war paint and ready
fortobringforthachangeonbehalf
of her people. She'sspeakingforthe
collective and it feels right. The
same can be said for Lorde: The
Curator.
Mockingjay - Part1 is a cohesive
album that continues to develop
the unique genre established - but
not perfected - by the series' first
two soundtracks. Here, Lorde has
perfected this sound and set the
bar high for soundtracks in general.
What's most commendable is that
she has succeeded in curating
a set of songs that at once feels
representative of the film itself
as well as fitting into the current
musical landscape as a whole.
With Mockingjay - Part 1, Lorde
continues her unexpectedly
triumphant ascendence to the top
echelons of the music industry and
proves that, yes, the odds are ever
in her favor.

Pink's 'pom pom' id

COLUMBIA
What's their hair-product-to-pull ratio?
SFr' a move in
the right direction

One Direction not
quite grown up on
fourth album
By MELINA GLUSAC
DailyArts Writer
What makes One Direction
beautiful? Well, to start off: them.
It's undeniable that Zayn, Niall,
Harry, Liam
and Louis
have evolved
into dapper Four
young Brits,
copious One Direction
amounts Columbia
of tattoos
and all. Their look is definitively
edgy (Harry's new tresses are a
point of debate for Directioners
worldwide), and on their newest
record, Four, they strive to
emulate this newfound badass
energy.
But what really makes them
beautiful is their vivacity -
something that was introduced to
the world on "What Makes You
Beautiful" but has weaned ever
since. 1D's newest installment
in their let's-leave-our-lyrics-
generic-to-make-girls-think-
our-songs-are-about-only-them
empire tries to let life and edginess
drive it, simultaneously. The
result is an inconsistent, lovelorn
explosion of arena ballads and
acoustic melodies alike, both in
desperate need of a little more

oomph.
Their first single, "Steal My
Girl," is one of the livelier ones -
it's an interesting, piano-laced jam
a la "Faithfully" by Journey, with
a huge drop at the chorus and a
catchy hook. Similar to "Where
Do Broken Hearts Go" on the
sheer epicness scale, it sounds like
it could be blasted in Ford Field,
which is always a good thing.
But it also sounds like *NSYNC
could've done just as an effective
job with the song, and that's not
good; Queen Elizabeth's quintet
still needs to hone its own style.
Regardless, the boys needed these
two tunes to beefup the album.
They take a country turn on
"Ready to Run," which actually
works for them, but it falls into
the hole of familiarity, safety
and boredom. "Fools Gold" and
"Spaces" follow suit, blending in
with all other acoustic ghosts of
years and albums past. There's
simply nothing unique about these
ballads anymore; the five Brits
scored a hit with one of them,
"Story of My Life," a few years ago,
but it's time to move on now. They
say they're "ready to run," but are
theyreally?
The band gains a bit of
momentum on songs like "Girl
Almighty," a wake-up call for
the album, to be sure. It's got an
inventive sound, yearning lyrics
and pop-punk pacing - a little
dose of electro-shock therapy like
this can never hurt the listener.
But, alas, Ed Sheeran creeps

in with his unplugged guitar,
narcotics and a night light, and the
listener has no choice but to sleep
again. Co-pennedby Sheeran, "18"
is blissfully unoriginal, slow and
just too freaking innocent. "Night
Changes" takes the same turn, but
it has a few drumsato give it at least
one direction (pun intended but
not proudly).
God save the Queen! Finally, the
listener rejoices with "No Control,"
a sexy, pop-punk number that
sounds like pre-2010 All-American
Rejects. The band needed the grit,
but it's unfortunate that it took the
whole album to get there. And on
the kitschy "Fireproof," peaceful
drums and sweet falsetto in the
chorus help it power through.
"StockholmSyndrome"radiates
with its nifty metaphor, sultry
guitars and an incredible beat in
the chorus, it's undoubtedly the
best song on Four. It sounds like a
hit, like One Direction of the future
- slightly electronic, modern,
rock-y and just plain old cool. The
album exits with a bang; "Clouds"
is another rock-infused, layered
arena anthem with the bestkind of
chaotic energy. Finally they gave us
somethingtoworkwith.
Four is a triumphant attempt, an
album with about as much edge as
Harry's butterfly tattoo - a tattoo
at least, so they get street cred for
that - but the subject matter is
still abit safe. They're almost there
- almost grown up, musically.
Though boring at points,Four is a
tiny step in the right direction.

Indie artist returns
with a trip into his
own subconcious
ByBRIAN BURLAGE
DailyArts Writer
There's a wonderful poem by
Wallace Stevens called "Tea at the
Palaz of Hoon" and it reminds
me of Ariel
Pink quite
frequently. It's
a poem about pOm pOm
self-discovery,
though not in Ariel Pink
any traditional 4AD
sense. The
speaker descends purple-clad
through lonely air down into the
depths of his mind. It's not really a
retreat so much as it is an inward
cerebral joyride. The speaker talks
of strange ointments, music and
a sea. "I was myself the compass
of that sea," he says, raising an
interesting thought: in the deepest,
most bizarre frontiers of our
imagination, who can guide us but
ourselves? And doesn't it make one
hell of a spectacle? "I was the world
in which I walked, and whattI saw /
or heard or felt came not but from
myself; / And there I found myself
more truly and more strange."
The last line of that poem has
always struck me differently when
I read it in the context of Ariel
Pink and the profundity of his
imagination. Through his own
specialized brand of psychedelic
pop, developed over the years in
places like his bedroom and garage
(Animal Collective picked him up
as anunsigned25-year-oldin2003),
Pink explores the regions of his
mind as though it were a constantly
changing planet without time and
without the seriousmeansto evolve.
As a result, his music is consistent
in that it's familiarly obscure. His
two prior albums,Before Today and
Mature Themes, are linked to pom
pom somewhatcthrough their sound
but mostly through Pink's honest
and whimsical introspection. They
are three distinct travel records into
the mind of a man who sounds like
he escaped from the North Pole and
is continuing to discover the tastes
and styles of pop music through
'80s horror flicks.
While Pink has often cited The
Cure as a major influence on his
work, and while the same synth-
curtain falls over most of the same
mouthy vocals and weary-toned
guitars, the band Love, in the era
of Forever Changes, is his more apt
predecessor. They are each, at heart,
natural musicians with a marvelous
talent for crafting light-sounding
pop anchored by its own unwieldy
subject matter. It can come across
as superficial and nonchalant, but

if you tune your ear to the right
frequency - their frequency - you
can hear the music's intricacies and
little pieces actively coagulate like
a sort of sun-pierced stained glass
window.
Pink and Love are also similar
in their pushing of listeners toward
self-abandon; that is to say, they
each tend to draw on images and
fantasies from the unconscious in
order to unsettle thelistener.Arthur
Lee, as the principal songwriter
for Love on Forever Changes, went
about this rather innocently and
self-mockingly, a good example
beingthe first two lines of"Live and
Let Live" in which he sings, "Oh,
and the snot has caked against my
pants /It has turned into crystal."
Ariel Pink on the other hand
takes serious pride in his effort to
subdue the listener's judgment,
making it more of a strategic ploy
than a stylistic flare. He recently
reflected on his music and echoed
this idea.
"Maybe by making people feel
uncomfortable, I tap into that
uncanny quality that is part of the
scariest, weirdest things that you'
remember happening to you as
a kid." As if the statement wasn't
overtly Freudian enough, he then
added, "I mine that territory more
than anything:the unconscious."
For Pink, little matters aside
from the place he takes listeners
throughout the album. From song
to song, he packs as many melodies,
jingles,bridges,hooks,cuesandriffs
as he can fit - all fuel for a rocket
launch overthe miiental divide and
into-the realm of the unconscious.
From the outset on pom pom's
opener he sets the scene, telling us
exactly where it is we'll go: "It's a
Tokyo night when you feel alright
/ The Arkansas moon's gonna shine
tonight / All over the world we're
gonna do it right." The catch is that
even though this trip sounds fairly
normal and fun, the place we're
really going is somewhere far less
identifiable, a place where people
wear "Raincoats in the big pig
parade."
The front side of pom pom is
deliciously overwrought with '80s
dream pop and psychedelic rock,
reworked and reshaped until old

familiar phrases and tunes become
clever quips for Pink's peculiar
agenda. The stretch of pop-rock
songwriting from"White Freckles"
to "Nude Beach A Go-Go" is one
of this year's best, crammed with
unusual turns of phrases that'll
stick in your head all day. "I'm a
hunter / I flash my teeth / I snuck
you into my dog nest," Pink sings
to a beat-driven, synth-screaming
chorus on "Lipstick." The way he
sings "dog nest" could easily be
heard as "darkness," which makes
a lot of sense for this record. This
sound on pom pom is darker than
much of Pink's recent work, if not
entirely more serious.
For example, "Picture 'Me
Gone" is probably the most serious
thing Pink has done. In October
he teamed up with the children's
group PS22 Chorus, to record a live
version of the song. If you can set
aside the ridiculously silly idea of
Pink being a lead choir boy, what
you get instead is a heartfelt song
about a father lamenting the loss
of his family's physical, hard-copy
photo albums. Instead, he's forced
to search through a computer hard
drive to "make a toast to glory
days.' Registering at 5 minutes and
41 seconds, the song is slow and
expansive, centered on a chorus
that's filled with pained emotion.
It's Pink at his weirdest:somber.
For the most part, pom pom is
a continuation of Pink's maniacal
thrust into the subconscious mind,
where there is both escape from
one's self and immersion in it. That,
I think, is the central problem of
Pink's' music: how does one soar
through the boundless territory
of the unconscious without being
completely consumed by what they
see? And as he remains dedicated
to finding an answer, he does
leave a little kernel of truth for us.
On the album's closer, "Dayzed
Inn Daydreams," Pink describes
his fascination with dreams and
dreaming,how they openup worlds
within worlds within ourselves.
But he also notes that imagination
breeds mystery, and in this mystery
we tend to hide ourselves. "The
story ends untold/My willsurvives
/ In a thousand future lives," he
sings, "And with that / Ibid adieu.'

MEN'S SOCCER -
Stevens in line to
fill seniors' shoes

Seniors leave lasting mark for''M'

By KEVIN SANTO
For the Daily
There are bigshoesto fill on the
Michigan men's soccer team.
The Wolverines (3-3-2 Big Ten,
6-9-3 overall) ended their season
on Nov. 9 in a1-O loss to Ohio State
in the first round of the Big Ten
Tournament, and they'll graduate
six seniors.
The senior class, including
its captains goalkeeper Adam
Grinwis and midfielder Tyler
Arnone, won't be easy to replace.
Grinwis started 10 .games for
the Wolverines, recorded two
shutouts and posted a .684 save
percentage. In addition, Arnone
was a consistent force in the
midfield, where he started 16
games and recorded one goal and
three assists.
However, the departure of a
strong senior class leaves room
for younger talent like freshman
defender Billy Stevens to settle
into amore influential role.
Stevens was quick to emphasize
his high hopes for the team at the
beginning of the season.
"I expected a lot from us,"
Stevens said. "We came in early
with captainpracticesearlierthan
actual scheduled practices. We all
started to play together, and gel,
and try to work everything out
earlier at the beginning of the
season rather than face problems
mid-season."
The season was a tale of
two teams, as the Wolverines
were plagued by inconsistency.
Michigan settled for a 0-0 tie in a
contestwith DetroitonOct. 21but
recorded a 3-2 victory against No.
6 Notre Dame on Oct. 7.
"I think it's just that, more
mentally, we would prepare
ourselves a lot more for games
against the Notre Dames and the
Marylands, all those top teams,"
Stevens said. "We would also
prepare for teams like Bowling
Green and Detroit, but I feel like
most of us would not think that
they would be more of a challenge
than playing Notre Dame."
Itwas clear that the Wolverines
leaned on their freshman class
this season, playing four of six
recruits in 10 or more games.

"I thought the majority of us
contributed very well," Stevens
said. "I felt like we contributed a
good amount for being freshmen
coming in, not knowing about
how good our conference is with
all the good teams that are in it.
I think we did pretty well, but I
thought also that we could have
done better."
The freshman defender
credited the leadership of the
senior class for such a large
contribution this fall, but stressed
that his fellow freshmen are ready
and capable of embracing the
challenges that Michigan will
face next season.
"I feel like the experience is
going to be here," Stevens said. "I
feel like we're going to know a lot
more about the college game and
feel that we're going to be able to
contribute alot more."
If Stevens and freshman
forward Ahinga Selemani are
any indication of the success that
will follow this freshman class,
the Wolverines have reason to be
optimistic. Both players garnered
All-Big Ten Freshman Team
honors Nov.12.
"It's a great feeling because
it shows my hard work paying
off," Stevens said. "I always try
to strive for more but it's a step in
the right direction. I feel that I'm
blessed to receive it."
After starting 17 games for
Michigan, Stevens isn't ready
to rest on his laurels. He hopes
to get stronger and faster this
offseason. In addition, Stevens
hopes to improve his on-the-ball
ability and his defensive game,
in which he wants to become
more consistent with his standing
tackles.
More important than anything
else, though, the young defender
commented on an attribute
that is often innately possessed:
leadership.
"I want to become more of a
leader," Stevens said. "I mean, I
am still a young guy on the team
but I feel that I could help lead
these guys into battle week in,
week out."
The Wolverines have a void to
fill, and Billy Stevens is the man
to do it.

By SERENA SAAKE
for theDaily
The Michigan field hockey
team finished off the season
earlier than it wanted, failing to
make the NCAA tournament.
At the Big Ten Tournament,
the Wolverines came out strong
in the first round, defeating Rut-
gers 3-0 in their first matchup.
Bolstered by this performance,
senior back Leslie Smith recalls
feeling excited about her next
game, not focusing in on the fact
that it could be the last of her col-
legiate career.
In the second round, Michi-
gan held off Northwestern to a
2-2 tie at the end of regulation
time, but Northwestern scored
just a minute into overtime, end-
ing the Wolverines' chance for
automatic qualification into the
NCAA tournament.
But Michigan still hoped for
the last at-large bid in the tour-
nament until the selection show
on Nov. 9.
"It was really sad when our
name wasn't called during the
show," Smith said. "It Was devas-
tating to say the least.
"For me, I think the hardest
part was just accepting that it
was my final year."
Though play has officially
ended, Smith and senior mid-
fielder Ainsely McCallister were
given one last chance to play
before their seasons and careers
are over in the National Field
Hockey Coaches Association
on Nov. 22. The game sets up
two teams comprising the best
seniors in the nation to compete
for a final time.
"I've heard it's just a really
fun game and notsuper competi-
tive," Smith said. "So I'm really
looking forward to it.
"I have a ton of friends from
other universities who will also
be playing, so it will be fun to
compete and have a positive way
to go out.".
The two 'seniors end their
careers on a high note, after play-
ing key roles in the program's
success for the past five years.
Smith's career got off to a slow
start; she played only the season
opener in 2010 before being red-
shirted. It wasn't until her red-

"In your last year, there is

are glad to take credit for. It's
that kind of success that will

Five things we learned

In place of playmakers, role
players end scoring drought

ByMINH DOAN Michigan close. Dunston finished
Daily Sports Writer with 10 pointson the game.

Michigan women's basketball
coach Kim Barnes Arico's third
season with the Wolverines got
off to a hot start as her squad
won two games over Detroit
and Bucknell, 76-57 and 68-61,
respectively.
Expected to come out of the
weekend undefeated, Michigan
didn't disappoint early with
matchups against two teams
that were under.500 last season.
Here are five (early) things
we learned from Michigan's
first weekend of action.
L Scoring will come from
many different players.
Friday against Detroit, six
different players ended the
game scoring in double figures.
Sunday, four players reached the
mark. Four starters - freshman,
guard Katelynn Flaherty,
senior forward Cyesha Goree,
senior guard Nicole Elmblad
and sophomore guard Siera
Thompson scored double
digits in both games.
And Sunday, when senior
guard Shannon Smith,
the leading scorer for the
Wolverines last season, was
in foul trouble early, the other
starters stepped up to fill the
scoring void.
But it wasn't just the starters.
When the Wolverines
struggled to shoot the ball in the
last 10 minutes of the first half
against Detroit, it was freshman
forward Jillian Dunston who
stepped up with eight points in
a span of four minutes to keep

2.Goree will drawattention.
After an All-Big Ten Second
Team performance last year,
Goree is going to see a lot more
double-teams this season.
Detroit double-teamed Goree
the minute she touched the ball,
denying her a chance to operate
in the blocks. Goree's presence
attracted the opposing team's
other forward to slide over to
defend her, leaving Michigan's
other forward wide open.
For most of the second half,
Elmblad was the beneficiary.
Elmblad scored a majority, if
not all, of her points off assists
from Goree after she was double-
teamed down low.
3. Ball protection is critical.
While the second half went
the way of the Wolverines
against Detroit, the first half
went the complete opposite.
The first half saw Michigan
turn the ball over 10 times in a
variety of different situations.
Most came in transition, when
the Wolverines tried to force the
ball to a teammate, but others
came when the guards tried to
feed it down low to no success.
Whatever the case may be,
Barnes Arico said Michigan
needs to slow down the game and
be patient with the ball. It tried
to playat a fast pace and force the
ball when better options were
available.
It could've been first-game
jitters, but the Wolverines will
need to protect the ball this
season if they want success.

4. Flaherty can shoot the
rock and she can shoot it well.
One of Michigan's strengths
this season is how well they
shoot the ball.
After this weekend, when
Flaherty shot over 55 percent
from 3-point range, scoring
29 points over the span of two
games, once again leading the
team, it is pretty clear that
she has become a part of that
offensive threat.
But give credit to the quick
ball movement of all the offense,
which allows not only Flaherty,
but the rest of the guards on the
team to take uncontested shots.
5. BOLD, PREDICTION:
Michigan won't lose before
Dec.13.
The Wolverines will travel
to South Bend to take on No.
3 Notre Dame in less than a
month. Between then and now,
six games separate the key
fixture on Michigan's schedule.
Of the six opponents the
Wolverines will face, only one
team - Washington State - is
receiving votes in the AP poll.
Michigan will face the Cougars
the day after Thanksgiving in
San Juan, Puerto Rico, where
it is competing in the San Juan
Shootout.
And of those same six
opponents, only two teams,
Washington State and
Princeton, had records over .500
last season.
It's possible that a team
relying on its shooting prowess
so much could have a cold
shooting night, but the schedule
favors the Wolverines.

Eleven-goal
outburst propels
weekend sweep
By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
Midway through the second
frame on Friday night at Yost Ice
Arena, JT Compher held the puck
on his stick with what looked
to be an easy shot for the touted
sophomore center.
But instead of shooting,
Compher looked to his left, at his
linemate sophomore Max Shuart,
and passed. Shuart's shot became
the second goal of his career.
Compher is without a goal in nine
games.
"He's going to pass the
puck," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "He sees good plays
and he makes them. He gave
those wingers, literally gave,
them goals."
Having scattered just nine
goals in five losses this season,
the Michigan hockey team found
twine 11 times against American
International last weekend.
The sweep - which pushed
the Wolverines' record to a
more respectable 4-5 against
non-conference competition
- featured tallies from proven
scorers as well as role players, a
sign the unit is emerging from a
seven-game drought.
Though Compher - the
reigning Big Ten Freshman of
the Year and Michigan's Most
Valuable player last year - has
struggled to find twine this
season, his presence has sparked
offense in his linemates.

"At times at center, you're
not finding the back of the net
and you feel like you should just
start making plays," said junior
forward Boo Nieves - who made,
the transition from center to
right wingthis month. "But then
you get that one lucky shot and it
goes in."
So while Compher and skaters
like him work toward their
peak, the Wolverines will rely on
role players to step into a more
prominent offensive position.
Among those is senior center
Travis Lynch, who had his first
career multi-goal game Saturday,
scoring twice and matching his
career-high for points in a game
despite the fourth line seeing
limited minutes in the third
period. A feature of the penalty
kill more than anything else,
Lynch is off to his best start in
four seasons, having scored three
goals in nine games after tallying
just two in 29 starts last season.
"It's my senior year, I might as
well make the most of it," Lynch
said. "If I don't find the back of
the net, that's totally fine. I'm not
used to playing that role at all.
I'm used to playing PK, faceoffs,
D-zone, so I really just tryto focus
on that. If I have an offensive role
with the team, whatever helps is
what I need to do."
Lynch's former linemate,
Shuart is also contributing on
offense for the first time in
his career. Shuart, who went
pointless in 11 appearances last
season, scored his first career
goal against Michigan Tech
and finished last weekend with
a goal and an assist. Compher
and Shuart found Nieves in the
slot midway through the second

period on Saturday.
It was Nieves' first goal since
netting Michigan's only goal
against Penn State in the first
round of the Big Ten Tournament
last March.
Meanwhile, sophomore
defenseman Kevin Lohan
notched his first career goal in
Friday's 5-2 win over the Yellow
Jackets and added an assist
Saturday, upping his plus/minus
ratingto plus-4 on the season.
"Everyone wants to help the
team," Berenson said. "You don't
know how you're going to help on
a given game, but when it works
out that way, then good."
That doesn't mean the
Wolverines can bank on blue-line
shots like Lohan's finding their
way past Big Ten goaltenders.
They'll need Compher and junior
forward Andrew Copp to be there
in frontto deflectgoals in.
Copp scored twice on Friday
before adding a highlight-worthy,
power-play goal in the third
period Saturday. Last season's No.
2goalscorer, Copp is back on pace
to lead Michigan in scoring.
Alongwithsophomoreforward
Alex Kile - who also scored his
fourth goal Saturday - andsenior
forward Zach Hyman, Copp is
now tied for the team lead. On
the same line, Kile and Hyman
have combined for 19 points on43
shots this season.
Like Compher, Copp struggled
before the bye week. He netted his
first goal of the season on Oct. 31
against Michigan Tech. It should
only be a matter of time before
Compher, a second-round pick of
the Buffalo Sabres, follows suit.
In the meantime, role players
will need to step up on offense.

MEN'S BASKETBALL
'M' rolls Bucknell
behind quick start

Bielfeldt leads way in win

By SIMON KAUFMAN
Daily Sports Writer
If the Hillsdale game was the
subpar appetizer required before
the good stuff comes out, then
the Michigan men's basketball
team's game against Bucknell on
Monday night was the bottomless
breadsticks, entree and dessert all
at once.
The Wolverines took no time
digging in against the Bison,
devouring them, 77-53.
Unlike the first regular-season
game against the Chargers, in
which the offense struggled to
find a rhythm early on, Michigan
didn't wait long to satisfy its
appetite against Bucknell, scoring
the first 10 points of the game.
"Last game, losing the first
four-minute war, we wanted to
come out (tonight) and make the
first punch,notplay frombehind,"
said sophomore guard Derrick
Walton Jr. "So before the game,
we talked amongst ourselves and
made it a personal goal to just win
the first four minutes."
Redshirt freshman Mark
Donnal started the game for the
Wolverines at the '5,' but Michigan
coach John Beilein opted to sub in
senior forward Max Bielfeldt just
three minutes into the first half.
Beilein said Bielfeldt had a
great practice on Sunday, so he
decided the senior would be
the first big man off the bench
against Bucknell. And Bielfeldt
didn't disappoint.
In his first four minutes on
the floor, he knocked down
two 3-pointers; the first from
straightaway, and when junior
guard Spike Albrecht drove
baseline and drew Bielfeldt's
defender away, Albrecht dished
a pass to Bielfeldt setting the big
man up for an easy dunk.
Bielfeldt finished the game
with 18 points. His previous
career-high was four.

"I got in a rhythm and that's
beenone ofthekeys,"Bielfeldtsaid.
"I haven't quite gotten in a rhythm
most of my career, and when I got
there they set (me) at the top of the
key, and the opportunity was there
and I took it."
Bielfeldt, who missed
Michigan's summer activities
due to hip surgery, said his body
is "feeling better than it has all of
college."
Noticeably absent from the
scoring feast was junior guard
Caris LeVert, who scored just two
points in the first half - both on
free throws - and was 0-for-4
from the floor. The preseason All-
Big Ten selection didn't knock
down a shot from the field until
the 11:45 mark in the second half
and finished with just six points.
Despite not being able to find
his shooting rhythm, LeVert was
able to find teammates who had
the hot hand, collectingsix assists
on the night - all in the first half.
Sophomore forward Zak Irvin
went 6-of-8 shooting in the first
half, draining three shots from
deep for 16 points in the first
frame to help Michigan carry a
48-19 lead into the locker room.
Irvin finished the game with 23
points, leading all scorers.
Walton Jr. also picked up slack
for LeVert. He went 5-of-9 from
the field, finishing with 15 points.
The sophomore also collected
eight boards for the Wolverines.
On the defensive end,
Michigan's help-side defense
stymied the Bison in the first
frame, forcing them to rely on
outside shooting. Bucknell shot
just 7-of-22 from the field in the
half and 1-of-9 from beyond the
arc.
In the second half, the Bison
knocked down four 3-pointers in a
four-minute span, forcing Beilein
to call a timeout so his team could
regroup. And it was enough to
hold off the late scoringsurge.

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Editor
It all started with Max
Bielfeldt getting into the game,
which he had done 38 times in
his career. But then he knocked
down a 3-pointer, which he has
done just three times in nine
attempts.
Then he hit another, and he
was in previously uncharted
territory.
He wasn't done there, though.
Bielfeldt entered with 38
career points - only one per
game. He had scored more than
one-third of that in the first half
and had finished with 18 points
Monday night in the Wolverines'
77-53 win over Bucknell.
And then he led the fight song
in the locker room after the game
for what he recalled was his first
time.
"I'm happy for Moose," said
sophomore guard Derrick
Walton Jr. "He does that every
day in practice, believe it or not.
He gives us problems every day,
on the scout teamsometimes. For
him to be able to hit those shots
that he hits in practice in the
game, I'm really happy for him."
Though Michigan won
comfortably - and likely still
would have without the career
night from its unheralded
center - Bielfeldt provided an
immediate spark.

An April hip surgery
prevented Bielfeldt from playing
in the team's summer trip to
Europe. Then, the team made
the decision to reclassify him
from A redshirt junior to a senior,
making this his last year of
eligibility. Until Monday, he was
largely an afterthought in the
competitionfor playingtime.
He wasn't even in shape to
do sprints until about eight days
ago, according to Beilein. He
didn't play at all in Saturday's
game against Hillsdale and
gave Beilein the OK to allow
freshman big men Ricky Doyle
and D.J. Wilson more minutes.
"And then the last couple days
of practice, he's virtually been
a manchild playing with our
guys," Beilein said.
The Bielfeldt-led scout team

outplayed the first team in
practice Sunday, and the senior
became the first big man off the
bench.
In the grand scheme, the
competition could be more open
now.
"We'll wait and see how
it plays out," Beilein said. "I
won't be making any knee-jerk
(reactions), but I would assume
he'd be in the game against
Detroit."
One last time, Bielfeldt came
into the game, with 5:19 left
and a 24-point lead - when he
usually enters for the first time.
Immediately, Walton fed him
again, just as his teammates had
all night.
Then he was finally done for
the night. But in terms of this
season? Don't be so sure.
"It's a long season ahead of us,
lot of games. I don't want that to
be the highlight."

FOOTBALL RECRUITING
Crucial week for recruits

Clark dismissed from
program after arrest

By JUSTIN STERN
Daily Sports Writer
As Michigan football looks
ahead to its final two games,
many recruits are also eyeing
the program's final push, as they
weigh their options for next
season. Michigan has already
seen three players decommit this
season and any coaching change
could further put the 2015
recruiting class in jeopardy.
Here is a wrap-up of how the
remaining recruits performed
last weekend.
Chris Clark, tight end: Avon
Old Farms (Conn.) at Choate
Rosemary Hall (Conn.); Rank-
ing: ESPN (111) Scout (23)
In its firstgame without Clark,
the Avon Old Farms season came
to anend, asitwasdefeated49-20
in the playoffs. Last week, Clark
injured his medial collateral liga-

ment in his team's final regular
season game. However, he noted,
surgery will not be needed.
Now Clark must focus on two
important tasks duringthe offsea-
son. He must physically prepare
himself for college-level football,
as well as choose which school he
will attend. Clark has been com-
mitted to Michigan since June
2014, but has scheduled official
visits at other schools, including
North Carolina, Southern Califor-
nia and Texas.
Brian Cole, athlete: Saginaw
Heritage (Mich.); Ranking:
ESPN (142) Scout (39)
Saginaw Heritage finished
its season on Oct. 24 with
a 2-7 record. Many have
become speculative over Cole's
commitment due to quotes in
the last few months. According
to Rivais.com's Mike Farrell,
Cole has not planned an official

visit to Ann Arbor and writes,
"At this point, it is very unlikely
that he sticks with Michigan.
And to make things worse, if the
visit situation works out for the
Buckeyes, there is a solid chance
he may end up in Columbus."
Michael Weber, running
back: Cass Tech (Mich.) vs
Clinton Township Chippewa
Valley (Mich.); Ranking: ESPN
(169) Scout (99)
During a week of Big Ten
college football that was
highlighted by Melvin Gordon's
record-breaking 408-yard game,
Weber produced similar stats,
rushing for 404 yards and five
touchdowns on 32 carries. Cass
Tech reached the semifinals of
the playoffs with a 48-35 victory
over Clinton Township Chippewa
Valley. The Technicians will face
Saline on Saturday for a chance
to reach the state finals,

As the saying goes, when it
rains it pours, and the Michigan
football team has put that on full
display throughout this year's
never-ending campaign.
Before the team's second bye
week, there was little that could
drag the Wolverines down
further. But the arrest of senior
defensive end Frank Clark
for alleged domestic abuse
Saturday and his subsequent
dismissal from the team by
coach Brady Hoke on Monday
managed to do that.
"Frank Clark has been
dismissed for violating team
rules from the Michigan football
program,"Hokesaidinastatement
released Monday morning. "This

"The harsh reality of it is I did
the right thing today," Hoke said.
"Domestic abuse is tragic and
it's tragic on a national scale. It's
tragic in our society and we all
need to do something about it.
"It's a message I send strongly
to our football team, what we (do)
and how we will handle ourselves
with women."
Clark appeared in Sandusky
Municipal Court Monday at 10:30
a.m. via teleconference where
he pled not guilty to domestic
violence charges. He was released
on bail shortly after.
"(Hoke) has expectations for
everyone on this team and if
you don't follow them, if rules
are broken, stuff will happen,"
said senior middle linebacker
Jake Ryan. "He has talked about
domestic violence with us, that's
one ofthe things you can't do. And
it's unfortunate this happened."
On the field, Clark's position
will be filled by junior defensive
end Mario Ojemudia with
sophomore Taco Charlton moving

over to back him. Redshirt
freshman Henry Poggi will move
behind senior Brennen Beyer
on the'strong side. All of those
moving players received high
praise from Hoke and Mattison as
both coaches feel the position is in
good hands.
Moving forward, Clark's
tale will be one in a long list of
controversies that has filled the
2014 season.
"It's pretty amazing so many
things keep coming up," said
fifth-year senior quarterback
Devin Gardner. "But it's
preparing us to deal with stuff
in life. You're going to have a lot
of adversity. Things are going to
come that you don't expect.
"And (there's) a lot of things
we've dealt with it and I think
that we've dealt with it well.
We need to continue to stay
grounded and continue to work.
That's what you're going to have
to do as a citizen in the world
and that's what we're learning
to do right now."

FASH~ N SEAKSHoke stood by the statement
Monday during his weekly meet-
ing with the media when he said
he found out about the incident
Sunday morning. Once he learned
all the surrounding information
was legitimate there wasn't much
of a decision to make on Clark.

Hoke said the subject of domes-
tic violence is discussed multiple
times a year with his team and as
a husband with a daughter and
two sisters, the issue hit home
with the fourth-year coach.

Senior Frank Clark will miss Michigan's final two games after his dismissal.
