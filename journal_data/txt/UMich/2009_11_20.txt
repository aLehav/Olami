Regents approve
renovation projects,
master's program
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
At the monthly Board of
Regents's meeting yesterday, Cyn-
thia Wilbanks, the University's
vice president for government rela-
tions, provided the regents with an
update on state funding.
Wilbanks told the regents that
although the news from Lansing
has been bad for
the state's col- NOTEBOOK
leges and uni-
versities in the past few months, it
appears that it could get even worse
in the coming months and years.
"Fiscal year '11 may be much,
much more difficult than the fis-
cal year '10 hudget," Wilhanks said
in an interview after the regents'
meeting yesterday.
Wilbanks said despite the state's
economic woes, investments in
higher education must be main-
tained if the state hopes to improve
its economy in the long-term.
"Policymakershave tomakereal-
ly difficult choices, and of course
the University's position is going to
be education spending," Wilbanks
said. "Education investments are
the best investments you can make.
Education is the key to the econom-

ic diversity of the state."
Many moving targets remain in
the state's current budget and the
budgets for the 2011 and 2012 fiscal
years, including a possible recis-
sion of higher education funding
this year, Wilbanks said.
"The fact is that almost every-
thing rightnow is a moving target,"
Wilbanks said. "Projections cur-
rently suggest a $1.5 billion or so
shortfall, so it's clear that the state
will need to set priorities."
REGENTS APPROVE $31.4
MILLION IN RENOVATIONS
The regents approved $31.4 mil-
lion in new funding for renovating
facilities and upgrading operations
at the meeting,
The largest of the projects,
which. is expected to cost $17.6
million, will be used to renovate
46,000 square feet of the Univer-
sity's Varsity Drive storage facility
and 6,800 square feet of the Ruth-
ven Museums Building.
After the renovations, specimens
from the museum's "wet" collec-
tion will be moved to the Univer-
sity's Varsity Drive storage facility,
while select items will be kept in
the teaching collection at the Ruth-
ven Museums Building.

Apparel company
re-hires workers
after pressure from
0 activist groups
By CAITLIN HUSTON
DailyStaffReporter
When Russell Athletic Corpo-
ration announced this week that

it would re-hire 1,200 Honduran
workers who critics claim were
fired earlier this year because they
unionized, anti-sweatshop organi-
zations at universities across the
country rejoiced.
LSA senior Jody Schechter, a
member of Students Organizing
for Labor & Economic Equality,
was among those celebrating'
the company's sudden acquies-
cence.
"We have a word for that: jus-

tice," she wrote in an e-mail inter-
view with the Daily.
Since Russell closed the newly
unionized factory last Janu-
ary, the United Students Against
Sweatshops (USAS) coalition - of
which SOLE is an affiliate - has,
through its protests and activities,.
pressured 96 colleges and univer-
sities to discontinue their licens-
ing agreements with the company,
according to an article in The New
York Times.

Amid these concerns, Universi-
ty of Michigan officials announced
in late February that its licensing
contract with Russell would not be
renewed.
Withdrawing the licensing con-
tracts proved to be an effective
tactic, as Russell Athletics stood to
lose millions of dollars in revenue
without the rights to sell the logo-
bearing apparel.

Space utilization effort
saves millions for 'U'

Officials say better
use of campus
classrooms will help
long-term finances
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
In an attempt to control costs,
University officials say they have
been focusing a great deal of atten-
tion on more effectively using
* classrooms. And a presentation at
the University's Board of Regents
meeting yesterday appears to
show that their work is really pay-
ing off.
Frances Mueller, project man-
ager of the Space Utilization Ini-
tiative, gave an update on the steps
she and campus leaders have been
taking to more efficiently utilize
existing space on campus spon-
sored by general fund revenue.
The plan is meant to be a more
fiscally sound alternative to rent-
ing spaces or building new facili-
ties.
The initiative - aimed at bet-
ter using existing space, elimi-
nating unnecessary construction,
leveraging the University's high-
est quality spaces and decreasing
the University's environmental
impact - was launched in Feb.
2007by University President Mary
Sue Coleman, Provost Teresa Sul-

livan, Timothy Slottow, executive
vice president and chief financial
officer, and Stephen Forrest, vice
president for research.
In an interview yesterday
morning before the regents meet-
ing, Mueller said new construc-
tion on campus paid for by the
general fund has fallen drastically
since the initiative was launched,
saving the University $185 million
in new construction costs.
Additionally, Mueller said the
University has been able to save
$7.5 million in annual operating
costs by cutting back on new con-
struction projects.
Though these savings do not
factor into the $100 million Cole-
man has called for to be eliminated
from the University's budget over
the next two years, there havebeen
realized cost reductions that will
count toward the $100 million goal.
Mueller reported that to date,
$10 million in energy savings have
been realized as part of the initia-
tive and that $1 million in recur-
ring lease expenses have also been
eliminated.
In an interview last spring, Sul-
livan said classroom spaces are
only used, on average, 50-60 per-
cent of the time between 8 a.m.
and 5 p.m. The goal set forth in
the Space Utilization Initiative is
to have the 527 general purpose
classrooms on campus used 70
percent of the time between those
hours, with each use utilizing 65

percent of the seats in the class-
room.
One of the biggest obstacles
in improving space utilization
has come in the form of rallying
departments and units to work
together to share their spaces with
each other, Mueller said.
"There's kind of been a reluc-
tance to maybe share space on this
campus because we're so decen-
tralized," Mueller said. "I think
there's justbeen abeliefthatonce
space got allocated to(departments
or units) it-was theirs indefinitely
and this is changing the culture
and the mindset to make everyone
realize that whatever space your
using ... it doesn't belong to you, it
belongs to the institution."
In the face of this reality, efforts
are underway to change the cul-
ture on campus and how units
think about their space, as opposed
to the space of other units.
"I think we've made a lot of
progress," Sullivan said. "There
is this sense of territoriality that
departments and schools have
about space adjacent to them.
Well, we're trying a new concept
now - that room belongs to the
University."
Mueller echoed Sullivan's
statement, saying at this point she
thinks most people understand
the reasoning behind the collab-
orative initiative.
"Some people may not be happy

New jobless claims unchanged,

Economists: Report
could suggest a
decline in November
job losses
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
number of newly laid-off workers
seeking unemployment benefits
was unchanged last week, remain-
ing above the level that would indi-
cate the economy is adding jobs.
New jobless claims have fallen
about 22 percent since spring. But
companies' reluctance to hire is
weighing down the housing mar-
ket - and the economy's fledgling
recovery:
The proportion of homeown-
ers with a mortgage who were
either behind on their payments
or in foreclosure hit a record high
for the ninth straight quarter, the
Mortgage Bankers Association
reported yesterday.
Driven by risingunemnployment,
fixed-rate loans to people with
good credit accounted for nearly
33 percent of new foreclosures last
quarter. That compares with just
21 percent a year ago.
The Labor Depa.rtment said
first-time claims for jobless
benefits amounted to a season-
ally adjusted 505,000 .last week:

That was the same as the previ-
ous week's revised figure, and it
matched analysts' expectations. A
year ago, there were 533,000 ini-
tial claims.
The four-week average, which
smooths out volatility, fell for the
11th straight week to 514,000, the
lowest level in nearly a year.
Some economists saidthe report
was an encouraging sign that job
losses in November will decline
from last month's total. Employ-
ers cut a net total of 190,000 jobs
in October, down from 219,000 the
previous month.
Economists at Deutsche Bank
are forecasting that net job losses
will fall to 125,000 in November.
But the economy needs to add
about 125,000 jobs-a month just to
keep the unemployment rate from
rising.
Separately, the Conference
Board said its index ofleading eco-
nomic indicators rose 0.3 percent
last month, less than analysts had
expected. That indicates a slow,
bumpy recovery next year.
The index forecasts economic
activity by measuring jobless
claims, stock prices, consumer
expectations, building permits for
private homes, the money supply
and other data.
A gauge of consumer expec-
tations, which are dropping as
unemployment continues to rise,
weighed down the index. Uneasy
consumers likely will curtail their
spending, which powers about 70
percent of the U.S. economy.
The stock markets fell in morn-
ing trading. The Dow Jones indus-
trial average dropped about 160
points, and broader indexes also
declined.
While the steady decline in
claims is evidence that firings are
decreasing, most economists say
weekly claims would have to fall
to about 425,000 for several weeks
to signal that the economy is actu-
ally adding jobs. Some economists
put the number higher, around
475,000.
Even as claims are falling and
the economy has started growing,
the unemployment rate is rising. It
jumped to 10.2 percent in October
from 9.8 percent, the highest level
in more than 26 years, the govern-
ment said earlier this month.
The economy grew at a 3.5 per-
cent annual rate in the July-Sep-
tember quarter, the government

said last month. But many econo-
mists expect growth to slow in the
current quarter. Recent reports on
industrial production and housing
have been disappointing.
The number of people continu-0
ing to claim benefits, meanwhile,
dropped by 39,000 to 5.6 million
for the week ending Nov. 7, the
department said. The figures on
continuing claims lag behind ini-
tial claims by a week.
But the continuing claims fig-
ure does not include millions
of people that have used up the
regular 26 weeks of benefits typi-
cally provided by states. They are
receiving extended benefits for up
to 73 additional weeks, paid for by
the federal government.
Nearly 4.2 million people were
receiving extended benefits in the
week ended Oct. 31, an increase of
120,000 from the previous week.
Congress added 14 to 20 weeks
to the extended program Nov. 6,
the fourth extension since the
recession began and the longest
total extension on record. That
boosted the total number of weeks
a person could collect unemploy-
ment to as much as 99 in the hard-
est-hit states.
But more than 1 million people@
will run out of unemploymentben-
efits in January unless Congress
quickly extends federal emer-
gency aid, a nonprofit group said
Wednesday. The November exten-
sion didn't address an underlying
problem: The emergency unem-
ployment compensation program,
including all additional weeks,
expires at the end of this year.
Some employers are continuing
to lay off workers. In a securities
filing Thursday, AOL said it plans
to cut about a third of*its work
force once it is spun off from the
media conglomerate Time Warner
Inc. That would amount to nearly
2,300 of the roughly 6,900 work-
ers at the struggling Internet com-
pany.
Hartford, Conn.-based health
insurer Aetna Inc. this week said
it will cut 625 jobs, or nearly 2 per-
cent of its staff, and will make a
similar job cuts in the first quarter
of2010 due to the lagging economy
and the potential impact of health*
care reform.
Several state governments
also announced layoffs, includ-
ing Pennsylvania, Indiana and
Maryland.

GM analyst
predicts solid
November sales
U.S. auto sales could top an annu-
al rate of 10.8 million in Novem-
ber, General Motors Co.'s top sales
analyst said yesterday. That would
mark the first month this year that
sales jumped to such levels with-
out the aid of Cash for Clunkers
rebates, which boosted sales in July
and August. Executive Director of
Market Analysis Mike DiGiovanni
says the industry is having a solid
sales month through the first 19
days of November, another sign
that the economy is beginning a
slow recovery from recession. He
also said GM could see its fourth
straight month of market share
gains in November.
Others are a bit less bullish. The
Edmunds.com automotive Web site
forecasts an annual light vehicle
sales rate of 10.3 million and J.D.
Power and Associates predicts 10.2
million.
The annual rate for Novem-
ber, typically a slow sales month,
is adjusted for seasonal variances.
Edmunds predicts light vehicle sales
will drop 4.5 percent this month
when compared with year-ago
results. J.D. Power estimates a 7.6
percent decline.
LOS ANGELES
U of Calif. approves
big tuition hikes
The governing board of the Uni-
versity of California approved a
$2,500 student fee increase yester-
day after two days of tense campus
protests across the state.
The vote by the Board of Regents
in a windowless University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles, meeting room
took place as the drone of protesters
could be heard from a plaza outside.
Scores of police in riot gear guarded
the building.
The 32 percent increase will
push the cost of an undergraduate
education at California's premier
public schools to over $10,000 a
year by next fall, about triple the
cost of a decade ago. The fees, the
equivalent of tuition, do not include
the cost of housing, board and

books.
"Our hand has been forced," UC
President Mark Yudof told report-
ers after the vote. "When you don't
have any money, you don't have any
Wmoney."
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras
Honduras interim
president may take
leave for vote
Honduras' interim president
said yesterday he may step down
temporarily to allow voters to con-
centrate on the upcoming presiden-
tial elections.
Roberto Micheletti said he will
consult his advisers and those who
have supported his government
on whether he should step aside
ahead of the Nov. 29 election and
until at least Dec. 2, when Congress
is scheduled to vote on whether to
reinstate ousted President Manuel
Zelaya.
Micheletti did not say who
would be in charge of the govern-
ment if he takes the weeklong leave
of absence.
"My purpose with this measure
is for the attention of all Hondurans
to concentrate on the electoral pro-
cess and not on the political crisis,"
Micheletti said in a message broad-
cast on national television.
He said he would immediately
return to the presidency should
threats to "order and security arise."

Sites serve as a
recruiting tool, though
most are not run
directly by al-Qaida
RIYADH,Saudi Arabia (AP) -
Increasing numbers of English-
language Web sites are spreading
al-Qaida's message to Muslims in
the West.
They translate writings and ser-
mons once largely out of reach of
English readers and often feature
charismatic clerics like Anwar al-
Awlaki, who exchanged dozens of
e-mails with the Army psychiatrist
accused of the Fort Hood shootings.
The U.S.-born al-Awlaki has
been an inspiration to several mili-
tants arrested in the United States
and Canada in recent years, with
his Web-based sermons often turn-
ingup on their computers.
"The point is you don't have to be
an official part of al-Qaida to spread
hatred and sectarian views," said
Evan Kohlmann, a senior investiga-
tor for the New York-based NEFA
Foundation, which researches
Islamic militants.
"If you look at the most influ-
ential documents in terms of
homegrown. terrorism cases, it's
not training manuals on build-
ing bombs," Kohlmann said. "The
most influential documents are the
ones that are written by theologi-
cal advisers, some of whom are not
even official al-Qaida members."
Most of the radical Islamic sites

are not run or directed by al-Qaida,
but they provide a powerful tool
for recruiting ,sympathizers to its
cause of jihad, or holy war, against
the United States, experts who
track the activity said.
The number of English-lan-
guage sites sympathetic to al-Qaida
has risen from about 30 seven years
ago to more than 200 recently, said
Abdulmanam Almushawah, head
of a Saudi government program
called Assakeena, which works to
combat militant Islamic Web sites.
In contrast, Arabic-language
radical sites have dropped to
around 50, down from 1,000 seven
years ago, bgcause of efforts by gov-
ernments around the world to shut-
them down, he said.
AI-Qaida has long tried to reach
a Western audience. Videotaped
messages from its leader, Osama
bin Laden, and his deputy Ayman
al-Zawahri usually have English
subtitles. But translations of writ-
ings and sermons that form thy

Winfrey expected to
begin show on new
cable network in 2011
CHICAGO (AP) - "The Oprah
Winfrey Show," an iconic broad-
cast that grew from a local Chica-
go talk show into the foundation
of a multibillion dollar media
empire, will end its run in 2011
after 25 seasons on the air, Win-
frey's production company said
last night.
Winfrey, who became one of the
most powerful women in enter-
tainment from a seat on the couch
of her set in Chicago's West Loop
neighborhood, plans to announce
the final date for her show during
a live broadcast today, Harpo Pro-
ductions Inc. said.
A Harpo spokeswoman declined
to comment yesterday on Winfrey's
future plans except to say that "The
Oprah Winfrey Show" will not be
transferred to cable television.
Winfrey is widely expected to
start up a new talk show on OWN:
The Oprah Winfrey Network, a
much-delayed joint venture with
Discovery Communications Inc.
that is expected to debut in 2011.
OWN is to replace the Discovery
Health Channel and will debut in
some 70 million homes.
CBS Television Distribution,
which distributes "The Oprah Win-
frey Show" to more than 200 mar-
kets blanketing the United States,
held outhope that itcould continue

doing business with Winfrey, per-
haps producing a new show out of
its studios in Los Angeles.
"We have the greatest respect
for Oprah and wish her nothing but
the best in her future endeavors,"
the unit ofCBS Corp. said in astate-
ment. "We know that anything she
turns her hand to will be a great
success. We look forward to work-
ing with her for the next several
years, and hopefully afterwards as
well."
Winfrey's 24th season opened
earlier this year with a bang, as
she drew more than 20,000 fans
to the city's Magnificent Mile on
Michigan Avenue for a Chicago
block.party with the Black Eyed
Peas.-
She followed up with a series
of blockbuster interviews - Mike
Tyson and Evander Holyfield,
exclusives with singer Whitney
Houston and ESPN's Erin Andrews,'
and just this week, former Alaska
governor, GOP vice presidential
candidate and best-selling author
Sarah Palin. She found time
between shows to lobby the Inter-
national Olympic Committee in
Denmark for Chicago's failed bid to
host the 2016 Olympics.
The loss of "The Oprah Win-
frey Show" would be a blow to
CBS Corp. because it earns a per-
centage of hefty licensing fees
from TV stations that use it.
On a conference call with
analysts two weeks ago, CBS
Chief Executive Leslie Moonves
said the contract with the show

ran through most of 2011 and
"if there's a negative impact, it
wouldn't hit us until '12."
CBS continues to sell several
top shows into syndication, how-
ever, including "Wheel of For-
tune" and "Jeopardy." But many
TV stations are struggling with
falling advertising revenue and
were unlikely to pay the same fees
as in the past for Winfrey's show,
which has seen ratings slip 7 per-
cent from a year ago and saw its
average viewership slip below 7
million last season.
Winfrey started her broad-
casting- career as a teenager in
Nashville, Tenn., reading the
news at WVOL. Two years later,
Winfrey started co-anchoring
news broadcasts on WTVF-TV
in Nashville. In 1976 she moved
to Baltimore to anchor newscasts
at WJZ-TV before becoming host
of the local talk show "People Are
Talking."
In 1984, she relocated to Chicago
to host WLS-TV's morning talk
show "A.M. Chicago" - the show
was became "The Oprah Winfrey
Show" one year later. She set up
Harpo the following year and her
talk show went into syndication,
rising to become one of the most
successful in the history of broad-
casting.
"I came from nothing," Win-
frey wrote in the 1998 book
"Journey to Beloved." "No
power. No money. Not even my
thoughts were my own. I had no
free will. No voice.

Hundreds cheer
Palmn in Mich.

Grand Rapids was
first stop on'Going
Rogue'book tour
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP)
- College students ditched class,
employees skipped work and some
huddled in the cold overnight just
to make sure they get an orange
wristband yesterday that would let
them meet Sarah Palin.
A line of more than a thousand
people - some sporting Palin
Power stickers and Palin T-shirts
- moved slowly into a Barnes &
Noble store yesterdayto see the for-
mer Republican vice presidential
candidate and Alaska governor on
the first stop of her "Going Rogue"
book tour. During the hours they
waited, some broke out in chants of
"Palin! Palin! Palin!"
Scores more who couldn't get
wristbands awaited Palin's arrival
outside, braving the cold and yell-
ing. "USA!" and "Sarah, Sarah!" at

an event that took on the feel of a
political pep rally.
"She's a person of faith, she has a
family, she has gone through a lotof
the trials and tribulations we have.
I'd vote for her in a heartbeat," said
Lana Smith, a dispatcher at a bus
companywhotookthedayoffwork,
and had been waiting in line since
5:30 a.m.
"Someday I hope her name is up
in lights and I'll have had the privi-
lege of meeting her," Smith said.
The song "Only in America," a
standard on George W. Bush's 2004
campaign stops, played as Palin's
tour bus, painted to resemble the
cover of her book, pulled up to the
Woodland Mall in Grand Rapids.
"I just can't tell youhow good it is.
to be back in Michigan," the former
Alaska governor said after getting
off the bus carrying her youngest
son, Trig. "Alaska and Michigan
have so much in common, with the,
huntin' and the fishin' and the hock-
eymoms, and just the hardworking,
patriotic Americans who are here."

China continues detention,
mistreatment of US geologist

Chicago-trained
Xue Feng charged
with stealing
state secrets
BEIJING (AP) - Sometime into
his longdetentionbyChina's feared
state security agents, American
geologist Xue Peng had something
to show U.S. consular officials on
their monthly visit. He rolled up his
sleeve, revealing the burns where
his interrogators pressed lit ciga-
rettes into his arm.
Xue also had something to say:
He wanted his previously unpub-
licized detention made public in
hopes that the outcry would win his
release.
But Xue did not get his wish.
His wife balked, as did the U.S.-
based consultancy that employed
him until months before he was
detained, both saying that going
public might hurt rather than help
his case. The U.S. Embassy, caught
between his desire to go public and
his wife's wish for privacy, worked
behind-the-scenes for his release.
So two years after disappear-
ing into custody, the University of
Chicago-trained Xue (pronounced
shway)remainsheld at anunknown
location in Beijing, charged with
stealing state secrets over the pur-
chase of a commercial database on
the oil industry. His case has been
batted inconclusively between
prosecutors and the courts, which
twice asked for more evidence,
acyording to a summary of the case
prepared by Xue's wife and seen by
The Associated Press.
On Tuesday, President Barack
Obama raised Xue's case at his Bei-
jing summit with Chinese President
Hu Jintao in the latest and highest-

level intervention, said a White
House official on the trip, speaking
on condition of anonymity because
he was not authorized to release the
information.
More than an instance of abu-
sive, intransigent Chinese justice,
Xue's case raises disturbing ques-
tions about the quiet lobbying for-
eign governments, companies and
the families of detainees often use,
believing it more effective with an
authoritarian Chinese leadership.
"Under difficult and danger-
ous circumstances, Dr. Xue made
it clear that he wanted the Ameri-
can people to learn of his ordeal. I
have little doubt thathad his wishes
beenrespected,hiscase wouldhave
already been resolved," said John
Kamm, a human rights campaigner
with a two-decade track record of
getting prisoners released to whom
the State Department turned for
help this month.
Beijing's State Security Bureau
and the Procuratorate, or prosecu-
tor's office, declined comment. A
spokesman for the city's No.1 Inter-
mediate Court, a Mr. Niu, said Xue's
trial "is still in mid-process," where,
according to the case summary, it
has been since July.
Xue's wife, Nan Kang, who was
born in China like her husband and
who lives with their children out-
side Houston, has hired a lawyer.
She said she wanted to keep her
husband's detention quiet for fear
that going public would have reper-
cussions for their parents in China
and disturb their two children,
especially their young son.,
Kang declined to comment fur-
ther publicly. In the case summary
she wrote: "My husband denies the
charge against him, and he believes
that he was helping China attract
inward investment and to improve
the Chinese economy."

The U.S. Embassy in Beijing said
that it has monitored Xue's case
since soon after his arrest, visiting
him over 20 times, delivering mes-
sages from his family and pressing
for his release. It declined to release
further details and would only say
that Xue asked for his detention to
be made public "some time ago."
U.S. governments have for years
weighed whether jailed dissidents
and Anmerican prisoners are better
served by public pressure, closed-
door diplomacy or a combination of
thetwo. The Obama administration
has tried to keep any likely disputes
over human rights, a perennial irri-
tant in relations, from damaging a
broader agenda crowded with the
economic crisis, climate change,
nuclear proliferation and other
global issues.
The AP learned of Xue's case last
week. The U.S. Embassy initially
requested that publication be with-
held, saying it mightharm attempts
under way to gain his release. But in
recent days, the embassy has said
it detects no progress in the case.
Xue's wife has asked that the case
not be made public out of concern
for her family. Given Xue's wishes
to go public and the lack of prog-
ress, the AP decided to publish.
"I have been writing letters to
members of Congress, the Senate,
the Bush administration, the Obama
administration, at least two ambas-
sadors in Beijing - Huntsman and
Randt - trying hard over time to
raise his case and make sure every-
one was aware of it," said David
Rowley, a geo-sciences professor at
the University of Chicago who was
Xue's doctorate thesis adviser.
"I have tried to be an advocate,
but in the wishes of Dr. Xue's wife,
I have tried to keep this out of the
public eye and tried to deal withthis
privately."

Common sense
The Common App will ease burden on potential students
tudents may remember how difficult it was to apply to mul-
tiple colleges that all required different applications. But
the process is about to become a little easier for students
who want to apply to the University. Administrators recently
announced that they intend to adopt the Common App, a standard-
ized application already in use by many universities. By making it
so that students don't have to fill out so many distinct applications,
the University will attract more applicants from across the coun-
try. As it transitions to the Common App, the University should
simply make sure that it retains unique and important criteria

Smoking won't stop

here has been a lot of talk late-
ly about the University's pro-
posed campus-wide smoking
ban, which would
prohibit smoking
on all University .
property start-
ing in July 2011.
Aside from the
fact that the ban
is both unfair
and an infringe-
ment upon stu-
dents' rights, the JARSHA
ban's enforce- PANDUAG
ment mechanism K
the ban is illogi-
cal. Violators of
the ban will be directed to cessation
workshops instead of paying fines.
But cessation workshops aren't going
to curb smoking on campus. Instead
of creating a new policy that isn't
going to work, enforcement of the
current smoking policy on campus
should be improved.
First of all, it's important to
remember that the policy in place
now, which says that smoking should
be a "reasonable distance" from
building entrances, isn't enforced.
Cigarette smokers can always be
found smoking in between classes
directly outside busy buildings like
Mason Hall or the Modern Lan-
guage Building. It's possible that the
new policy is partially a reaction to
complaints due to lax enforcement
rather than the need for a new initia-
tive. After all, Ken Warner, dean of
the School of Public Health, said at
a University forum last week that he
wasn't sure how the ban originated.
It may be true that at four other
universities that implemented a simi-
lar prohibition, 97 percent of people
were said to have behaved in accor-
dance with it. This could be because a

comprehensive ban has more concrete
limits than "reasonable distance," or
because relatively shoddy enforce-
ment goes under the radar. But stud-
ies of compliance rates have not been
done for the 256 other colleges where
a smoking ban has been put in place,
so it's definitely possible that the com-
pliance rate is exaggerated.
It's irritating that the University
administration seems to be making
the same mistake. The first smoking
policy isn't working properly because
it isn't enforced, and the restrictive
new policy borne of this failure will
probably fall into the same trap.
Though the University's intentions
may be benevolent, there is a major
flaw in this approach. Understanding
why takes a review of the transtheo-
retical model regarding behavioral
change. According to the theory, the
process of quitting smoking can be
broken into five stages: precontem-
plation, contemplation, preparation,
action and maintenance. The most
important stage to understand is
precontemplation. In this stage, indi-
viduals are completely unwilling to
quit and may not be swayed because
they are either "unconvinced of the
problem, see change as impossible or
are unwilling to change."
As the 2006 Maryland Adult
Tobacco Surveys show, 61 percent of
smokers are in this precontempla-
tion stage. Essentially, direction to
attend smoking cessation workshops
wouldn't be beneficial at all to them.
Considering the majority of smok-
ers on campus are likely to be in the
precontemplation stage, these work-
shops have a far greater potential to
be a waste of money than an effective
enforcement mechanism.
The University of Iowa, which was
mandated to ban smoking on campus
by state law, has a much more logi-

cal approach to enforcing the law.
There, violators are fined $50 per
infraction. Establishing tangible
consequences, as opposed to offer-
ing treatments that smokers may not
be open to, is a much more effective
method of making sure the Univer-
sity's current policy is followed. In
addition, a fine would easily raise
revenue for the University, which
could help make up the cost of ces-
sation programs that may be useful
to the proportion of smokers who are
considering quitting. Such programs
could be a part of the solution, but
not the major component of aiding in
the enforcement of the ban.
U should better
enforce its current
smoking policies.
If the current smoking policies
were properly enforced, and officers
ticketed people smoking near build-
ings, there may have been less sup-
port for the campus-wide smoking
ban in the first place. This enforce-
ment should have been the solution
to any complaints about smoking on
campus. The prohibition is an egre-
gious violation of students' rights,
and it excessively stigmatizes one
bad habit - but the wrong approach
is being taken to enforce it by the
administration, since most smokers
aren't going to quit because of a ces-
sation workshop. if the ban is inevi-
table, it would be better to save the
money and fine violators.

from its existing application.
The Common App, which currently serves
392 other major private and public universi-
ties, provides a single, standardized applica-
tion form for undergraduates and includes
school-specific supplements. Admissions
officials have applied to start using the Com-
mon App as early as this February. If every-
thing goes as planned, students applying for
the University's late summer admissions
cycle of 2010 will be the first to submit the
populat application. Administrators plan to
preserve the unique essay questions found
on the current application by including these
questions as supplements. The change will
affect the format of the application, rather
than the substance of it.
While proponents of the University's
exclusive application might argue that it
separates the dedicated applicants from
the uninterested, there is little reason that
the application process should be made
any more burdensome than it needs to be.
The University's move to the Common App
reflects the realities faced by high school
seniors today. The high-achieving stu-
dents that the University hopes to attract
shouldn't have to fill out separate and
redundant paperwork for every school to
which they apply. And since the switch to
the Common App is primarily a matter of
reformatting the information on the appli-
cation and can still include the essay ques-

tions that make the University application
unique, there's little benefit to using an
exclusive application.
The switch to the Common App is a
gesture of outreach that will increase the
University's visibility and attract a more
geographically and socially diverse group
of applicants. As a result, the University's
already massive number of applicants will
almost certainly increase. Many similar
schools have reported more applications
after making the switch to the Common
App. As the size of the applicant pool
increases, the University can expect to have
an even more varied group of applicants
from which to choose. The result will be an
even more diverse student body.
It may be true that the Common App
could cause more students with less inter-
est to apply to the University as a backup
school. But the benefits in having a larger
pool of applicants to draw from will more
than offset this. And administrators can
work to ensure that an increase in the num-
ber of out-of-state applicants doesn't com-
promise the availability of quality education
for students in Michigan.
The University's switch to the Com-
mon App is a good move, promising a more
diverse applicant pool and decreasing the
burden on high school seniors applying for
college.

EILEEN STAHL I
Dying for Twilight love

ANDREW CHINSKY I

*I

Unless you live in a promotion-proof bunker,
you know that today is the release date for "New,
Moon," the movie based on the second of Stephe-
nie Meyer's four amazingly popular "Twilight"
books for young adults. These hyper-dramatic
romance novels about the sparkling emo vampire
and the girl who loved him send teen girls squeal-
ing loudly enough to kill small animals. And
while I enjoy a good love story, there are some
seriously creepy messages in "Twilight" about
what is and isn't romantic. I want to know who
the hell decided to market "Twilight" to teens
and tweens.
Case in point: our 17-year-old heroine, Bella,
spends the majority of "New Moon" trying to kill
herself because her zombie boyfriend, Edward,
hs broken up with her. Well, technically, she's
throwing herselfinto potentially lethal situations
because it causes her to hallucinate Edward's
voice screaming at her for being a melodramatic
cretin. But if she does die in the process, Bella
assures us she's fine with it, because her life
is officially over now and "the sheer beauty of
(Edward's voice) amazed me. I couldn't allow my
memory to lose it, no matter the price." Accord-
ing to Meyer's website, we shouldn't judge Bella
for any of this because this is how people behave
when they lose true love.
Yeah. This isn't My Little Pony.
The Yellow Ribbon Teen Suicide Prevention
Program, apparently the last people on Earth
whose brains haven't been shorted out by glitter,
issued a warning that a movie presenting sui-
cide as romantic might not be such a good thing
to show to teenagers, especially if they share
Bella's low self-esteem. Across more than 2,200
pages, Bella moans incessantly about how she is
"hideous" and "worthless." Unfortunately, these
are feelings that a lot of teen girls can identify
with. Thanks in part to the Ralph Lauren school
of beauty, American girls are undergoing what
many mental health professionals call "a crisis of
self-esteem," obsessing over being attractive and
accepted by peers. This is more than typical teen
angst-- the last twenty years have seen skyrock-
eting rates in depression, eating disorders and
self-mutilation among young women.
It's Edward's acceptance, I think, that makes
him so appealing to girls. When you feel imper-
fect, the idea of a perfect guy who will wrap you
in his scintillating arms and whisper his devotion

for twelve paragraphs is a powerful and com-
forting fantasy. But Bella never learns to value
herself, continuing her tirade right up until the
last book. Instead, she bases her entire sense of
self on Edward's attention. As Robert Pattinson,
the actor who plays Edward, put it, "she doesn't
really get fixed, she just gets this addiction ... she
becomes completely dependent."
How dependent? When Edward leaves, even
if it's just for a weekend, we are treated to daz-
zling descriptions of Bella having what sound a
hell of a lot like panic attacks. "I would rather die
than stay away from you," she informs Edward,
and as "New Moon" proves, she wasn't kidding
around. She confesses she doesn't have much of
a life outside of Edward - friends, hobbies or a
personality - because her life is Edward. I should
probably also throw out there that Mdyer's char-
acters consistently praise Bella for being mature
for her age.
Basing your self-worth around the approval
of someone else leaves you wide open for abu-
sive relationships, and Edward often isn't the
best boyfriend this side of a restraining order.
He yells, intimidates and chastises Bella as if she
were a child. While Bella confesses she's afraid of
his "black moods," she blames her own inadequa-
cy for his behavior. It takes Edward cutting her
car's brakes and placing her under house arrest
to get Bella angry, but even then, she succumbs
to his will and never considers leaving him. After
all, his sister assures Bella while she's locked up
in Edward's house that he's only doing it because
he loves her.
I understand that "Twilight" is fantasy, but
abusive relationships, dependency and teen sui-
cide are pretty high on my list of things that aren't
romantic. Teen girls are taking the series very
seriously, even obsessively, reading the books
several times a week. on one thread I ran across
on Yahoo! Answers, a reader said, "I HAVE to
read it or I break down crying."
However much we may enjoy the good points
of "Twilight," publisher Little, Brown & Com-
pany had a responsibility to make sure the books
were appropriate before spending several million
dollars promoting them. We've been blinded by
dazzle. The time to start asking questions is long
overdue.

Party like it's 1969

This football season has been tough. After all the yelling,
analyzing and figuring out where things went wrong, at the
end of the day, we have to realize that sometimes things
just don't work out in sports the way we hope. But for true
Michigan students, alumni and fans, this season can still be
spectacular. The team can save everythingthrough one act:
beating Ohio State on Saturday.
A Michigan win wouldn't be the biggest upset in the his-
tory of the rivalry. That will always belong to the 1969 team'
coached by the legendary Bo Schembechler. But this vic-
tory would come close.
So, what can Michigan students, alumni and fans do to
help out the team and show that we are still true blue head-
ing into one of college football's greatest rivalries?
To start, come to the Go Blue, Beat OSU Pep Rally today
at 6 p.m. on the Diag. For those juniors and seniors and
graduate students who experienced this two years ago, you
know how great the event was. As one of the people who
experienced it, I have to say the word "experienced" rather
than "attended," because the atmosphere was so electric
I could feel it. Sophomores and freshmen who have yet to
experience an Ohio State game should be prepared for a
completely different feel to Michigan Stadium. Come to the
pep rally for a preview.
As a part of Go Blue, Beat OSU Week, the pep rally is a
culmination of efforts put forth by various student groups,

Michigan Student Association, LSA Student Government
and many sponsors. Thousands of free T-shirts, giveaways,
the band, cheerleaders, Football coach Rich Rodriguez and
the team will all be part of the spectacle Friday night. I say
this in part to entice you to coiie to the pep rally, but also
because I hope I'm not disappointed with student support
for this once-a-year event.
Everyday, someone sends an e-mail out to a group I'm
part of that states, "Selling OSU Ticket, Highest Offer." I
know it's tempting to forget about the game because the
odds of winning are so low. I know this season isn't great.
I know there is a hockey game and a basketball game that
night. Forget about all of that. This year is far from over.
This Saturday, everything is on the line. For once, Michi-
gan truly can be "all in."
Coming to the pep rally will prove that Michigan stu-
dents still believe in the maize and blue magic and are far
from the "fair-weather fans" other schools like to believe
we are. Go out to the bars or basketball or hockey after-
ward. But take one hour out of our last home football week-
end of the year and prove that you care about our school
and our team. On Saturday night, maybe we can party like
it's 1969.
This viewpoint was written by Andrew Chinsky
on behalf of the Go Blue, Beat OSU Core Team.

50 has guns,

"Wait. So when the world ends, our careers end too?

.Apocalyptically bad

By JEFF SANFORD
Daily Assistant ArtsEditor
in case you don't know by now,
50 Cent is hard. Curtis "Fiddy

ass around and
he wants you to
know all about **
how hard he his. 50 Cent
In fact, he's going
to tell you over Before I Self
and over again Destruct
exactly how hard Shady/Aftermath/
he is. He'll tell you Interscope
how many guns
he has ("more
than a gun store"). He'll relate to
you how his trigger finger's feel-'
ing ("itchy itchy itchy itchy"). And
after listening to his newest album,
BeforeISelfDestruct, and the inces-
sant tales of his off-the-Mohs-scale
hardness, you'll find yourself thor-
oughly convinced.
What you probably won't be
convinced of, however, is the con-
dition of 50 Cent's music career.
On his most recent effort, he's so
completely wrapped up in making a
case for his toughness that all other
concerns - like crafting a high-
quality album - fade into oblivion.
Essentially, BeforecISelfDestruct

make me" ("Pyscho") and "I'm not
tellin' you to shoot somebody / but
if somebody try to shoot you shoot
'em" ("Crime Wave") are typical
and unrelenting.
There's no doubt that 50 can
craft a hook (they're all over Get
Rich or Die Tryin' and, to a much
lesser extent, Curtis), and he shows
little sparks of this talent on this
album. "Death to Enemies" boasts
a vigorous early 2Pac vibe over a
tarry, GZA-inspired beat from Dr.
Dre. Veteran producer Rockwilder
supplies what could be the album's
best beat for "Do You Think About
Me," wherein 10's verses display

rare vulnerability that make the
track idiosyncratic enough to be
compelling.
But for the overwhelming major-
ity of the album, 50 just seems tobe
phoning it in. His flow is lethargic at
best, somnambulant at worst. The
lyrics are consistently groan-wor-
thy ("I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat/
I ain't no chump /Then you can run
Forrest, run retard / when I dump"
is a fine example). Happily, he has
the clout to attract brand-name
producers like Dr. Dre, Tha Bizness
and DJ Khalil, so the beats are con-
sistently top-shelf. But the relative
quality of the production makes it
all the more aftonishing just how
hard 50 Centbungled this record.
Guests do little to salvage Self
Destruct. Eminem's contribution
on "Psycho" is forgettable, as he
regresses back to his ultra-violent,
serial-killer alter ego that appeared
on early Slim Shady albums (on
"Psycho," he confesses: "ButI bare-
ly scratch the surface / like my last
batch of girlfriends / that I buried
in my fuckin' backyard /still trying
to dig their way out").
Ne-Yo and R. Kelly soften 50's
hard edges a bit and submit under-
whelming choruses on "Baby By
Me" and "Could've Been You,"
In case you didn't
know, 50 is hard.
respectively. Both cameos are an
overt stab at radio airplay, but the
tracks are too bland to distinguish
themselves from the rest of the gar-
bage heap that is radio hip hop.
50's constant perpetuating of his
ultra-hard image worked brilliant-
ly for him back in 2003. But now,
sixyears later, his "I've-seen-more-
shit-than-you" persona is extreme-
ly tired. It's fine for 50 to want to
express the fucked-up shit he has
seen and done. But when the album
is simply a vehicle to brag about it,
the results are pretty much value-
less. You think he would've learned
from the aggressive flopping of his
film "Get Rich or Die Tryin'," butI
guess not.

'2012' is so annoyingly
bad it will make you wish
* the world was ending
By NICK COSTON
Daily Arts Writer
It's hard not to think about what a physi-
cal copy of the "2012" script
looked like at its first pitch
meeting. It was probably a
stack of inky cocktail nap- 2
kins covered in pepperoni 2012
and Twizzlers that landed At Qualityl6
with a thud on the desk of and Showcase
startled producer Mark Gor- Columbia/Sony
don. Writer-director Roland
Emmerich, at the time, was
likely across the office with a potted fern doing
the Stanky Legg.
"What is this?" Gordon might have asked,
wary of the thick pile of napkins bubbling with
cheese on top of his credenza.
"That," Emmerich could have replied with
a crazy smile, "is the most awesomely terrible
movie ever written."
And that's precisely what "2012" is. It's
awful. It's almost three hours of CGI, a
screaming John Cusack ("1408") and hilari-
ously decayed bits and pieces of the disaster
film genre. It should have been titled "Obvious

Explosions." But if the audience can switch
off its brain, suspend its immense disbelief
and relish the lunacy of Cusack's aimless flail-
ing, viewers will find that "2012" is a moronic
guilty pleasure - a triple-bacon mushroom-
swiss burger of celluloid.
The plot of "2012" is just a series of giant
explosions. Though the film employs an
ensemble cast of highly respected actors,
Cusack's drooling, unintelligible performance
as failed novelist Jackson Curtis blows his
companions out of the water for all the wrong
reasons, with Cusack occasionally screaming
in pseudo-English throughout the film.
In the "2012," Emmerich, the director,
decides to kill the president by smashing the
U.S.S. John F. Kennedy, a ship stationed in
Philadelphia, into the north lawn of the White
,House as it rides a giant tsunami wave. It
becomes immediately clear once again that the
film is not remotely capable of subtlety.
By the film's repetitive, destructive second
hour, viewers may wonder if "2012" is actu-
ally a darkly brilliant glimpse into the tortured
mind of Cusack's character, who imagines the
world around him crumbling as he sees his
own professional aspirations dissipate.
The film also features Chiwetel Ejiofor
("American Gangster"), who plays a young
geologist explaining how giant volcanoes are
going to destroy Las Vegas. His straight-faced
performance, however, is so self-serious it's
almost annoying. Ordinarily an audience,

should be grateful when an actor delivers a
sincere dramatic performance. But Ejiofor
is so oblivious to the ridiculousness around
him that one can't help but wish he would
start picking his nose on screen. Fortunately,
Woody Harrelson ("Zombieland") picks up
the slack as a crazy-but-not-really conspiracy
theorist who subsists on a strict diet of giant
pickles and Pabst Blue Ribbon.
Even in the face of the trashy fun, there are
genuinely frustrating aspects of "2012." At two
hours and 40 minutes, the film is unbelievably
long. The world's most famous landmarks can
only digitally crumble to bits so many times
before the audience gets bored. More pressing-
ly, this film has already been made dozens of
times, a few of those times by Emmerich him-
self. "2012" borrows heavily from its director's
earlier films "Independence Day" and "The
Day After Tomorrow."
The film might make for a fun drinking
game upon its DVD or made-for-TV release,
with the events in the movie being so incred-
ibly predictable. In the theater, however, it's
reasonable to expect more from a $260-mil-
lion film.
As a work of cinema, "2012" deserves no
stars. It's a horrible film with horrible acting
and horrible editing. But as an experience,
as a ride, as a freakish and brainless parade
of explosions, it earns five Mountain Dews,
ten bags of beef jerky and three lower-back
tattoos.

Charles Darwin dreams of the future

By MOLLY MCGUIRE
Daily Arts Writer
2009 is an important year for
Darwin enthusiasts and natural
history scholars. It marks Charles
Darwin's
200th birth-
day and the Darwin's
150th anni- Dreams: The
versary of the Stn&* for

nial festivities
are still going.
strong. Australia is issuing a com-
memorative coin depicting Dar-
win, and natural history museums
all across the globe are holding
special events honoring the "father
of evolution."
As part of the celebration at the
University, a cast of students and
faculty are performing an origi-
nal play, "Darwin's Dreams: The
Struggle for Existence," at the
Exhibit Museum of Natural His-
tory tonight, Saturday and Sunday.
Written by Residential College
Assistant Professor and paleon-
tologist Catherine Badgley and
directed by RC lecturer Kate
Mendeloff, "Darwin's Dreams"
explores two weeks in Darwin's
life as he puts the finishing touches
on "Species." These two weeks are
well-documented and grounded
in history, but Badgley uses the
naturalist's dreams as a device to
explore the future implications of
his work. Darwin spends his days
penning passages for "Species,"

but atnight his dreams foreshadow
the repercussions of the words he's
writing.
"Dreams provide special oppor-
tunities in dramatic productions.
I use them as a creative vehicle,"
Badgley said.
"What would it be like if all of
us could see, a hundred years from
now, what was going to become of
the things that were most precious
to us? Would we like what we saw,
would we be horrified or would it
be something else?"
Through his dreams, Darwin
takes a glimpse at historical events
that have yet to transpire. Remi-
niscent of "A Christmas Carol," the
play depicts three visions, one for
each act. The first act focuses on
a religious conflict, highlighting
Darwin's unease about the tension
between his ideas and society's
need for god. The dream sequence
contains a debate between Bishop
Samuel Wilberforce, a harsh critic
of Darwin's ideas, and Darwin's
greatest advocate, Thomas Huxley.
Memoirs, letters and published
papers comprise much of the dia-
logue of the play. Characters often
speak words written by the actual
historical figures they are repre-
senting, creating a sense of histori-
cal realism.
The second act explores the way
Darwin's work came to be mis-
handled and exploited. Focusing
on the most grotesque misuse of
Darwin's concepts, the second act's
visiontakes place in 1935, depicting
Nazis justifying their actions with
Darwin's words.
Finally, the third act meta-the-
atrically makes use of the museum
setting, taking place in 2009 in a
museum exhibit about Darwin.
Depicting both the negative uses
and positive ramifications of Dar-
win's work, the dream sequences

eventually allow Darwin to finish works for the actors and hold the
the book that would become so interest of the audience. So that's

society that has been deemed crim-
inal," Silvers said. "Deemed crimi-
nal why? Usually because of the
color of our skin."
Felix Lopez, vice chair of MSA's
Peace and Justice Commission, was
the lead organizer of the event.
He said that after the death of
Imam Luqman Ameen Abdullah,
who was shotbyethe FBI in Dearborn
last month, he realized that students
on campus were unaware of police
brutality, even though it was occur-
ring so close to the University.
"Ann Arbor is a bubble and I
sometimes feel like I don't know
what's happening around me,"
Lopez said. "I just thought about
this idea especially after the mur-
der of Abdullah bythe FBI in Dear-
born. It really just struck a chord to
me in saying like 'Hey, we're stu-
dents and we're people too and it is
affecting us."
Lopezsaid withlastnight'sevent
he hoped to bring people together
on campus and inspire them to
work for change.
"We have to really be conscious
about these issues and really be
conscious about our own sur-
roundings and realize that being in

the University and having all this
access and resources that a lot of
people just don't have, that we can
actually make change," he said.
Kim Miller-Tolbert, chair of
MSA's Minority Affairs Commis-
sion, said police brutality needs to
be discussed more on campus.
"I think that police brutality is
an issue that affects a lot of people
and its somethingthat really needs
to be talked about and brought to
the forefront," she said.
I Silvers explained how a cycle of
poverty, crime, police brutality and
incarceration continues to repeat
itself. She said the core of the prob-
lem rests in the fact that people are
hungry and desperate for money.
From there, she said, come petty
thefts, which leads to incarcera-
tion, the inability to find employ-
ment after that incarceration and
then more poverty.
"If we were more concerned
with making sure people had food
to eat and a place to live we would
lessen the crime in our society," Sil-
vers said.
Davilatoro, who said he was
imprisoned for possession of mari-
juana, said he would never call the
police in any situation because he
has never had a positive experience
associated with them.
"I would never call the cops, not

Friday, November 20, 2009 - 7A
at all," he said "They ain't saving
my life, they're ruining my life."
Silvers told students that grass-
roots organization is the best way
to fight police brutality, but that the
process could take decades.
"It takes a long time to really
develop the kind of organization
you would need to stand up to
police brutality," she said.
John Oltean, chair of the Peace
and Justice Commission, said that
he was pleased with the discussion
that took place at the event. He said
that Silvers was able to give advice
to young activists.
"I liked the discussion aboutthe
activism and possible solutions to
organizing," he said.."I thinkitwas
pretty inspiring for some young
people of color and some activists
in the room to hear her stories and
how she's had success combating
these types of issues."
Max Nwabara, co-chair of the
NAACP Political Actions Com-
mittee, said that he was impressed
with the diversity of the event par-
ticipants.
"It's actually a more diverse
crowd than I thought it would be,"
Nwabara said. "I thought it would
be mostly minority students .but
there are a lot of whit6 students
who came out and I guess it's good
to hear."

$2.2 million. The project is expected
to be completed in fall 2010.
A renovation project at Wolverine
Tower, which houses much of the
University's business, finance and
development offices, was granted $6.3
million from the regents. This project,
which will renovate 61,000 square
feet, is expected to be completed in fall
2011 and will temporarily displace 50
parkingspots.
The regents also approved $1.5 mil-
lion to replace a chiller - essentially
a large air conditioning unit - that

,with all the things we're doing, but I
thinktheyunderstandatafundamen-
tal level why we're doing it and why
it's important to do it," Mueller said.
"It'sjust changing behaviors now."
In an interview on Wednesday,
Sullivan also stressed that efforts
underway to centralize the allocation
of classrooms would also be helpful
for student groups, who may current-
ly have difficulty securing a space.
"If you have a student group
that wants to find a place to meet
in the evening, how would you go
about doing that?" Sullivan said in
an interview on Wednesday. "Well,
sometimes it amounts to knowing

serves both the Chemistry Building
and the Willard H. Dow Laboratory.
Installation is expected to be com-
pleted next fall and is projected to save
$300,000per year in energy costs.
An additional $3.8 million was
approved to upgrade the University's
wireless internet network and tele-
phoneswitch.Theprojectalsoincludes
additional outside cabling to the Wall
Street complex, North Quad and the
North Campus Research Complex.
SCHOOL OF INFORMATION
TAKES CONTROL OF
MASTER'S PROGRAM
The regents approved a request
the secret handshake with some-
body to get access to a room."
Another major effort of the
Space Utilization Initiative has
been to centralize computer serv-
ers. Mueller said building server
farms allows the University to save
on space and energy required to
house and maintain servers that
have been previously spread across
campus at each building or unit. ,
"We have a couple of parallel
activities going on around comput-
er machine rooms," Mueller said.
"A lot of schools and colleges have
their own server rooms ... so we've
been working with units to get out
of the mindset that they have to
have their own machines in their
own building in order to manage
them, because a lot of that could be

to transfer the administration of
the Master of Science in Informa-
tion degree from the Rackham
Graduate School to the School of
Information.
Speaking before the regents yes-
terday, Provost Teresa Sullivan said
the move is consistent with admin-
istrative practices in other profes-
sional schools, like the schools of
Law, Engineering and Business.
"The MBA is not in Rackham; the
MPH is not in Rackham," Sullivan
said in an interview on Wednesday.
"It's similar to that."

mdnaged virtually."
Other efforts are also under-
way to better use space on campus,
including an effort to consolidate
vivaria facilities - which house
animals used for testing.'
Renovations to repurpose space
on campus are already underway,
with plans to convert the fourth floor
of Dennison Hall from classrooms to
office space for several environmen-
tal programs. The renovations are
scheduled to be completed during
summer 2010, University spokesman
Rick Fitzgerald said yesterday.
The initiative, which was started
two and a half years ago, is expect-
ed to be fully implemented over the
next two and a half years and Muel-
ler said she expects the University
to meet its utilization goals.


RUSSELL
From Page lA
for refusing to cooperate with
the original investigation into the
matter, conducted by the Worker
Rights Consortium, a University
affiliate that closely monitors fac-
tories that produce goods bearing
college and university licensed
logos. At the time, the apparel
maker said it was the economy, not
the staff's unionization, that influ-
enced the closing of the factory.
The University of Michigan's
Advisory Committee on Labor
Standards and Human Rights sent,
a letter to University officials ask-
ing them drop ties with the com-
pany in February.
"Because of the company's pre-
vious failure to adhere to its own
standards of conduct, we do not
feel that continuing the license,
even under strict monitoring of

any new code of conduct, is appro-
priate," the letter said.
USAS also successfully pushed
Russell to compensate workers for
the months they were dismissed
and incorporate a company-wide
neutral stance on unionization.
After hearing of the recent
breakthrough, Siobin Harlow,pro-
fessor of epidemiology and chair of
the Advisory Committee on Labor
Standards and Human Rights, said
she appreciates the work the stu-
dents have done.
"The University was pleased
to learn of the historic agree-
ment negotiated between Rus-
sell Corporation and workers in
Honduras," she said in an e-mail
statement.
In a press release, WRC Execu-
tive Director Scott Nova credited
the success of the movement in
part to the "involvement of the
University (of Michigan) and its
students and faculty."

"The strong and effective action
taken by the University of Michi-
gan in enforcing its labor rights
code of conduct played a vital role
in producing this historic result,"
he wrote.
While the future of the compa-
ny's relationships with schools is
still uncertain, SchechtertheSOLE
member, said the WRC is essential
in maintaining this victory.
"Continued support of indepen-
dentmonitoringbodies, particular-
ly the WRC, should be emphasized
in the universities' policies regard-
ing labor rights going forward,"
she said.
Harlow wrote in an e-mail
to the Daily that the committee
"will likely discuss this settle-
ment at its December meeting,
however the committee will not
review the case formally unless
and until Russell Corporation
makes an application to renew its
license with the University."

Beilein's Final Four meeting led
to matchup with Houston Baptist

The GreatestRivalry in Sport
A Rose for 'U'

By CHRIS MESZAROS
Daily Sports Writer
The Final Four isn't usually the
place where you would find a mid-
major cupcake team to schedule.
But that was exactly the case for
Michigan coach

some small talk Tweets:
and preliminary @michdai-
discussions, both lysports
men saw it as a mutual fit.
"He said (Cottrell) was looking
for games," Beilein said. "I said,
'Well, give us a call.' That's what
happened. They are in Division I

now, but independent. They are
always looking for games."
While Houston Baptist (0-3)
shouldn't pose too big of a problem,
it could be a trap game if the Wol-
verines are caught looking ahead to
their Thanksgiving tournament in
Florida.
Either way, when the Wolverines
and Cougars tip off tonight at Cris-
ler Arena, it will bethe last warmup
for Michigan (1-0) before it heads to
the Old Spice Tournament in Orlan-
do, Fla., where it will play games on
three consecutive days.
Other teams have started the
season playing in tournaments or
in ESPN's 24-hour marathon, but
Michigan has just one game in the
books so far.
"I'm excited to be playing bas-
ketball," senior DeShawn Sims said.
"I've been watching basketball and
it was so exciting. I'm like,'Man,we
don't have another game for anoth-
er four or five days' And just being
able to play that many games is like
making up for lost time."

While Beilein didn't intentional-
ly plan for the season to begin with
a pair of "gimme" games, it will
still help the young squad prepare
for the meat of the nonconference
sciedule. Once again, the Michigan
coaching staff will likely empty the
benches in orderto gauge the team's
depth before its schedule picks up
steam. Last weekend against North-
ern Michigan, nine playerscame off
the bench, combining for 38 points.
Freshman Matt Vogrich and senior
Zack Gibson led the reserves with
15 and 11 points, respectively.
"You don't want to start off with
the defending national champion
if you don't have to," Beilein said.
"You try to get your team just used
to whatgoes on in games, especially
since we're the third youngest team
in the Big Ten. That three games in
a few days is really going to sneak
up on us."
But Michigan has not shown its
inexperience so far. Vogrich drilled
all five of his attempts last Saturday
in his collegiate debut. His final

make also secured a triple-double
for junior forward Manny Har-
ris, the second time a player has
accomplished that feat in program
history.
"Even when I wanted to get him
out of there up 35 points, I hear he
has nine assists and say, 'Let's hope
somebody makes a shot, because
he'll get the assist,' " Beilein said.
"Matt drops it in and we get him out
of there. There's some luck involved
as well, but he's got the ability."
Vogrich was having so muchsuc-
cess from deep that he offered Har-
ris a premonition before he made
his final 3-pointer.
"Honestly, when the game was
going on, he was like,'You need one
more,' and I'm like, 'All right,' Har-
ris said. "He just winked his eye at
me, and then he shot a deep three
and made it."
While the Wolverines don't want
to get cocky two weeks into the
season, this is the kind of subtle
swagger that defines conference
contenders.

if the team plans on breaking out
of its slump, the Wolverines know
that this is the week.
"It's a game that could be
destructive if we lose," Rust said.
"But if we wis, it could get us on the
right path."
Part of getting on the right path
could be the new look for not only
junior Carl Hagelin and sopho-
more Luke Glendening, who were
both named alternate captains this
week, but also for the Wolverines'
first line.
Freshman A.J. Treais will be the
sixth winger to join junior Louie
Caporusso on the first line, which
hasn't produced as much offensive-
ly as Berenson had hoped for before
the season began.
But despite the potential offen-
sive firepower on the first line,

Berenson is choosing not to label
any of his lines as the "top line."
"We don't have a first line,"
Berenson said. "We have four lines
that have a chance of playing well."
Berenson said he has also been
impressed with the performance
of Glendening's line in practice.
He praised Glendening, freshman
Kevin Lynch and senior Brian
Lebler, for physical play and abil-
ity to open up the center of the ice
- something the Wolverines have
struggled with all year.
The Wolverines are looking for a
different kind of wake-up call than
they experienced against the Fal-
cons last season.
"It's pretty apparent to us that
we're 4-6," Rust said. "We're in
the lower tier in our league, and I
don't think the coaches need to tell
us much. If you look at the board
in the locker room or listen to stuff
around the league, you know this
isn't where we're supposed to be."

From the Editor: We hope you're
enjoying our look back at the Dai-
ly's game coverage from famous
Michigan-Ohio State games. The
Wolverines topped OSU in 2003 in
the rivalry's historic 100th game.
By J. BRADY MCCOLLOUGH
Former Daily Sports Editor
Sitting in the visiting locker
room at Kinnick Stadium after
a 30-27 loss to Iowa Oct. 4, the
Michigan football team's seniors
were in the midst of some major
soul searching.
The Wolverines were 4-2 and
had lost their chance at a national
championship. With one more
loss in their remaining six games,
the seniors would likely leave
Michigan without playing in a
Rose Bowl.
"We never thought we'd be
4-2 at that point in the season,"
Michigan fifth-year senior cap-
tain Carl Diggs said, "I never
imagine that."
But celebrating their 35-21 win
over Ohio State Saturday on a
rose-covered field with an emo-
tional student body, the Wolver-
ines were a long way from their
comber locker room in Iowa.
With six straight wins, three over
top-lII teams, Michigan rewrote
the script of its season, clinching
its first outright Big Ten title and
Rose Bowl berth since 1997.
"It's like a storybook (end-
ing)," senior tailback Chris
Perry said. "It feels surreal right
now, but after I get home and sit
down and think about it, it'll feel
better."
Perry better have gotten some
ice before he sat down. Struggling
with pain in his right hamstring
throughout the 100th meeting
between Michigan and Ohio
State, Perry ran for 154 yards
and two scores on 31 carries. The
Heisman Trophy candidate also
caught five passes for 55 yards,
giving him his fifth game this
season with more than 200 total
yards (209).
Perry and quarterback John
Navarre benefited from a deter-
mined offensive line, which shut
down one of the nation's most
dominating defensive fronts. The
Buckeyes, previously leading the
country allowing just 50.6 rush-
ing yards per game, gave up170
to the Wolverines. The Michigan
line also gave Navarre ample time
to throw, holding the Buckeyes
without a sack.
"It's a great feeling," Michigan
offensive tackle Tony Pape said.
"That was the No. 1 defense in
the nation. They're the defend-
ing national champions, and they
were a great defense."
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr
had to resort to trickery to get
the Wolverines on the board with
39 seconds left in the first quar-
ter. To the delight of the 112,118
strong at the Big House (a new
NCAA record), Michigan receiv-
er Steve Breaston lined up at cen-
ter, and Navarre spread out wide
with the Wolverines facing 3rd-
and-goal from the 3-yard line.

Breaston sprinted to his right and
followed the right side of the line
into the endzone, giving Michi-
gan an all-important 7-0 lead.
Two minutes after Breaston's
score, Navarre hit Edwards on a
slant. Edwards shed safeties Will
Allen and Nate Salley on his way
to a 64-yard touchdown recep-
tion, the longest of his career.
Edward later put the Wolverines
up by 21 with a 23-yard reception
that capped a 10-play, 80-yard
drive.
With less than six minutes left
in the half, quarterback Craig
Krenzel led the Buckeyes on an
81-yard drive to cut Michigan's
lead to 21-7 - the first points
given up by the Michigan defense
at home in the first half all sea-
son.
The Wolverines began the sec-
ond half with a five-play, 62-yard
drive capped off by a Perry
30-yard run for a 28-7 lead.
Ohio State, showing the will
of a defending national cham-
pion, fought back with, two con-
secutive scores to come within
28-21. Krenzel hit Santonio Hol-
mes for his second touchdown
of the game, this one coming on
a 13-yard fade route over corner-
back Leon Hall.
Two drives later, Ohio State
backup quarterback Scott
McMullen, filling in for Krenzel
(injured left shoulder), led the
Buckeyes on a 10-play, 93-yard
drive. Lydell Ross quieted the
Big House crowd with a 2-yard
touchdown run to bring Ohio
State within seven.
On the Wolverines' ensuing
possession, Navarre underthrew
Edwards, and Ohio State corner-
back Chris Gamble intercepted
the ball at the Ohio State 36.
"We love sudden changes,"
Michigan linebacker Scott
McClintock said. "We thrive on
it. We like getting on the field
with as much on the line as pos-
sible."
With its season on the line, the
Michigan defense held strong,
giving the ball back the Michigan
offense at its 12. Eight plays and88
yard later, Michigan took a 35-21
lead on a Perry 15-yard scamper
to the outside with less that eight
minutes left in the game.
While in Pasadena, Calif., for
the Rose Bowl, the Wolverines
can look back to Iowa. The Mich-
igan seniors addressed the whole
team after that game, letting
their teammatesknow that their
season was far from over.
"We didn't really know what
this team was made of yet," Diggs
recalled.
The next week at Minneso-
ta, trailing 28-7, Diggs and the
seniors got their answer. The
Wolverines showed that they
were made of championship fab-
ric, scoring 31 points in that fate-
ful fourth quarter to win 38-35.
"I'd be a fool to say it wasn't
a turning point," Perry said. "It
showed how much heart and
pride we had within ourselves.
"A lot changed that night in the
second half."

she never played guard before. It

For the first time this season,
Michigan also established scoring

Borseth said pbout the 6-foot-6
Phillips. "She has a major size
advantage. She's really close to
the basket. She scored some easy
ones and that really got us going.
We need to have that all year."
The Wolverines had not scored
91 points since the 2002 season,
when Hollins was in the fifth
grade.
The offense wasn't the only
thing that showed up at Crisler
for the Wolverines last night. The
fans typically hold up signs that
read "team: defense." And that
unit definitely performed up to
the crowd's expectations.
"We did a good job defensively
of not letting them get the ball

around the paint," Borseth said.
"First half, we really kept it out of
there, that's what good teams do.
I think we are a good defensive
team. If ve put our mind to it, I
think we will be a great defensive
team."
Michigan had six blocked
shots, one more than it had col-
lected in its two other games
combined.
The Wolverines also forced
27 turnovers and threw the
Lady Eagles out of their rhythm
throughout the night.
The Wolverines will put their
3-0 record at stake on the road
when they play at Kansas on Nov.
22. After that, they play seven
more games on the road before
coming back home to battle
Northwestern on Dec. 28.
"Let the fun begin," Borseth
said. "Now we get the chance to
go on the road and play some bas-
ketball."

THE GREATEST
Forget that Michigan is struggling for bowl eligibility.
Forget that Ohio State has already clinched a spot in
this year's Rose Bowl. And forget that it's almost been
2,200 days since Michigan beat the hated Buckeyes.
Today, on the 40th anniversary of the classic 1969
Michigan win, the Maize and Blue is lining up against
the Scarlet and Gray.
Regardless of the circumstances, that's something
special.
So, sit back and enjoy it - but only if you're watching on
TV. If you're in the Big House, plan to get a little rowdier.
The Daily hopes you have fun rushing the field after a 'W'.

about Brabbs' blood clots, but he
hadn't yet heard about the cancer
diagnosis. As soon as the coach
heard the news, he started asking
his former kicker about his fam-
ily, his plan and his emotional
state. They held tip the line, talk-
ing, as Carr made sure Brabbs felt
he had the support he needed.
Some of that support came
from what he had learned on the
gridiron. Brabbs believes you
have to stick it out through col-
lege in order to be called a Michi-
gan Man, that you can't truly be
delined as one until you receive
your 'M' ring.
And almost every day during
his treatment, he thinks of two

LLOYD remembers the day he truly
CARR became part of the club.
It was 1995, and after .15:
years of working as an assistant coach under Bo
Schembechler and Gary Moeller, it was Carr's
turn to be on top. The Wolverines started the
season with four straight wins before losing
quarterback Scott Dreisbach for the season. In
their next seven games, they limped to a 4-3
record.
Ohio State was coming to town. No. 2 in the
country. 11-0. Led by that year's Heisman Tro-
phy winner Eddie George and Biletnikoff Award
winner Terry Glenn.
ThoseWolverines had no chance.
And that's exactly what Michigan equipment
manager Jon Falk read in the Ann Arbor News,
three days before that game.
"Jon Falk came out toward the end of prac-
tice, and he's just walking as only Jon can walk,
and his head was down and he was walking
extremely fast across the practice field, and he

had a newspaper in his hand," Carr reminisces
now, 14 years later. "And Terry Glenn, at a press
conference, had made the statement that Michi-
gan was nothing."
Carr pauses, lets that sink in.
"And so I remember at the end of practice, I
took that paper out,*and I read it to our team."
But Glenn hadn't bargained on Charles Wood-
son, who covered him like a glove, stealing two
interceptions. Or Tshimanga Biakabutuka, who
rushed for an astonishing 313 yards on 37 car-
ries. Or a 31-23 Michigan upset.
After the postgame celebrations with the
team, and after the media frenzy, Carr walked
back into the locker room.
"I'll never forget," he laughs, shaking his head.
"Everybody had cleared out. I was in there, I
had come back from the press conference - and
there was Bo Schembechler.
"And he gave me a big hug and he said - he
said, 'I'm gonna tell you the same thing that
Fritz Crisler told me after my first Ohio State
game.' And I said, 'What's that?'
"He says, 'Lloyd, you'll never win a bigger

game than this one."'
AN OLD-SCHOOL MENTALITY"
Twenty years ago, then-Athletic Director Bo
Schembechler fired men's basketball coach Bill
Frieder after learning he was planning to leave
for Arizona State following the 1989 NCAA
Tournament. Schembechler didn't bother giv-
ing Frieder a chance to finish the season.
"A Michigan Man will coach Michigan,"
Schembechler famously proclaimed, right
before interim coach Steve Fisher led the team
to its only NCAA Championship in program his-
tory.
Even the most decorated Wolverines see
Schembechler's decision as the quintessential
example of the Michigan Man ideal, a story
that barely needs explanation. But the real-
ity of today's sports world is that that probably
wouldn't happen now - even in Ann Arbor.
"I think back then, you had more old-school
coaches who lived by a different creed, and I
think those coaches are almost extinct," says
1991 Heisman Trophy winner Desmond How-

ard, who calls Schembechler, his former coach,
both the "godfather" and the "architect" of the
tradition. "A guylike that, they're notrreally con-
cerned about any sort of negative backlash that
they may receive from their decision.
"I think these days now, some of the inmates
- some of the inmates run the asylum. I think
that'd be a rare occasion in today's sports world
or athletic arena."
Softball coach Carol Hutchins, the all-time
winningest coach in Michigan history, points to
the same basketball story to illustrate the tra-
dition. And at the end, unprompted, she offers
similar skepticism.
"I don't know if Bo would work in today's
world, but I think he had it right," she says. "He
taught kids the right values."
Deathless loyalty. Enthusiasm. Conviction.
Fielding Yost's definition of those "right values"
date back to the early 1900s. The idea of a Michi-
gan Man is ingrained in the school's culture, but
even those considered personifications of the
term struggle to explain exactly what it means.
"There's a lot of different strings attached,"

hockey coach Red Berenson says, shifting in
his seat and looking a little frustrated. "I don't
know if it will come out as clean cut and clear as
you want. It's a moving target.'
THROUGH RANOR SHINE
Ron Kramer sits in the back row of the second
floor of the Michigan Stadium press box, talk-
ing and joking with other Wolverine legends.
He doesn't often stay past halftime anymore, he
says. But it's been 50 years, and he still can't stop
coming back.'
After hearing his story, it's clear that runs in
his family.
His tale seems to begin and end with athletic
excellence. At Michigan from 1954 to 1956, he
won nine varsity letters in football, basketball
and track and field. He was a rusher, receiver,
punter and kicker for the football team in the
fall, the captain of the basketball team in the
winter and a high jumper in the spring.
With talent came accolades - his football
number, 87, is one of juSt five officially retired
by the program. He was a two-time football All-

American, helped the Green Bay Packers win
back-to-back championships during a 10-year
NFL career and is considered to be one of the
best athletes in Michigan history.
But that isn't what he talks about today.
If you want-to look at a real Michigan Man, he
says, look at his mother.
Kramer's parents devoted their lives to col-
lege football, traveling to all of Kramer's games
during his collegiate playing days. When his
father passed away, his mother learned to drive
a car so she could keep coming to Michigan Sta-
dium. Each week, she brought an apple to give
to the policeman who directed traffic at the cor-
ner of Stadium and Main. Just so he could have
a little bite to eat, Kramer says now.
For 241 consecutive games, Adeline Kramer
sat in section 2, row 83.
Her last year at a Michigan football game was
1987, the year before she died. But Kramer vis-
ited that seat a few weeks ago, and the fans in
section 2, row 83 still remember his mother.
In the 1960s, Kramer and a few of his Detroit
Lions teammates went to a game against Wis-


consin at the Big House. It started raining mid-
way through the contest, so they walked back
to the motor home they had taken to the game.
Michigan booster Hoot McInerney told the
group he was ready to leave.
"I said,'Sorry, Hoot.' " Kramer says."He said,
'What do you mean?' I said, 'Mother stays 'til the
end of the game.'
"So here's all these big, tough football players,
and we had to wait 'til the end of the ballgame.
Because my mother always stood out there after
the game was over and she said, 'Good game,
boys,' and she always greeted them."
MAKING THE
TRADITION YOUR OWN
Carol Hutchins used to be a Spartan. And
every year, someone makes sure she doesn't for-
get that.
"To this day, the week of the Michigan State
game, people ask me who I'm rooting for. And
I'm just appalled," she says, sitting in an office
with a giant, stuffed wolverine on top of the
bookshelf. "I always tell them, I always root for

Michigan State tocome in second.
"But I'm just appalled people ask that ques-
tion. To me, it's a stupid question."
She gestures to her navy blue warm-ups.
"Clearly. I'm blue. What part of me looks
green?"
It's a dumb question because it would be like
asking if Bo Schembechler had still cheered
for Miami (Ohio) over Michigan. Hutchins, a
two-sport Michigan State student-athlete, has
invested 26 years building a program from the
ground up in Ann Arbor. It doesn't matter if you
come here from the outside, she says. The real
issue is whether you take ownership of the tra-
dition.
And she uses a example from East Lansing to
prove that point.
"Years ago, Nick Saban was the football coach
up there," she says, referring to the nomadic
coach who, in the past 10 years, has coached
at Michigan State, Louisiana State, the NFL's
Miami Dolphins and Alabama. "And I used to
say to my former colleagues and friends, that's

The Daily's breakdown

By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN and
ANDY REID
Daily Sports Editors'
'M' RUN OFFENSE VS. OSU
Something's going to have to give
in this category.
Michigan is the Big Ten's second-
best rushing team, posting almost
200 ypg. Ohio State is a defensive
stalwart, holding teams to a Big.
Ten-best83 rushingyards pergame.
Brandon Minor, one of the Big
Ten's best backs, is out for Ohio
State. After finally rehabbing his
ankle, Minor banged up his shoul-
der against Wisconsin and has been
very limited in practice this week.
Minor's absence will be a huge
blow to Michigan's upset hopes.
Edge: Ohio State
'M' PASS OFFENSE VS. OSU
Tate Forcier had one of his best
games of the season last week at
Wisconsin, completing almost 77
percent of his passes. Still, he didn't
reach the 200-yard plateau, and a
few of his completions weren't the
most accurate passes, which limited
potential yards after the catch.
This will be the best passing
defense Forcier has faced since the
Iowa game, in which he was a paltry
8-of-19 for 94 yards and an intercep-
tion. Chances are, he'llhave a similar
day against the vaunted Buckeye 'D.'
Edge: Ohio State
'M' RUSHING DEFENSE VS. OSU
For the past few games, the Buck-
eyes' rush offense has become more
and more versatile.
When Ohio State quarterback
Terrelle Pryor injured his ankle two
weeks ago, the Buckeyes started run-
ning a dangerous wildcatplayset. But
now, Pryor is much healthier.
"We look at it as if we've got four
different runners, and at the moment
we worked it, the runningbacks were
healthier than Terrelle," Ohio State
coach Jim Tressel told The Cleve-
land Plain Dealer. "The good news is
I'd like to think we'll go into Saturday
and all four will be healthy."
Coupled with Michigan's lack-
luster rush defense - only Purdue is
worse - this is not a good matchup
for the Wolverines. If Michigan
doesn't want to break the record for
points given up in a season (it would
need to allow 40 Saturday), then
the underperforming linebacker
corps willhave to playone of itsbest
games yet - especially with OSU's
deadly rush attack.
Edge: Ohio State
M' PASS DEFENSE VS. OSU
This is where the stats might be a
bit misleading.
Pryor's passing ability, particular-
ly in a non-spread offense, has been

the topic of controversy at many
points throughout the season. But
even though Ohio State is last in the
Big Ten with less than 2,000 pass-
ing yards, Pryor is greatly improved
from last yearthrough the air.
And last year against Michigan,
despite-throwing going 5-of-13,
Pryor still racked up 120 yards and
a pair of touchdowns.
Against a Michigan secondary
that has looked abysmal at times,
there's no telling the damage Ohio
State's passing attack can do -
assuming its run game isn't effective.
Sure, the Wolverine defensive
coordinator Greg Robinson is pull-
ing out all the stops schematically,
and might have something up his
sleeve for this week as well. But the
key to Michigan stopping the Buck-
eyes is execution above all else.
Edge: Ohio State
SPECIAL TEAMS
Well, Michigan does have a
strong edge in punting.
Fifth-year senior Zoltan Mesko,
one of the best punters in the coun-
try, is going up against a counter-
part that is on the opposite end of
things - last in the Big Ten,
Their seven-yard difference in
punting average could .come into
play if this turns into a battle offield
position.
Just two kickers in the confer-
ence have missed more field goals
than the Buckeyes, while fifth-year
senior Jason Olesnavage has been
fairly consistent.
Ohio State's only advantage might
be in kickoff coverage, in which the
Buckeyes are best in the Big Ten.
Michigan return man Darryl Sto-
num hasn't had nearly as much
impact as he did in the beginning of
the season, and the Buckeyes' domi-
nance will quell his influence.
Edge: Michigan
INTANGIBLES
It's in the Big House. It's Senior
Day. That "42-7" score is still leavinga
bad taste in every Wolverines' mouth.
Michigan is going to be jacked for
this game.
Still, the stigma of Jim Tressel's
7-1 record against Michigan and the
fact that it's been close to 2,200 days
since Michigan won in The Game
gives the Buckeyes a little swagger.
The fact of the matter is that this
is stillthe greatest rivalry in sports,
regardless of Michigan's recent
woes. When it comes to Michigan-
Ohio State, you can throw the
records out the window.
Plus, it's the 40th anniversary of
the '69 team, which will be in atten-
dance. Maybe that will do some-
thing for the team?

ARCHIE GRIFFIN
Ohio State Buckeyes running back, 1972-75
Griffin is still the only two-time Hcisman Trophy winner in history,
winning it in 1974 and 1975. He was also the first to start in four Rose
Bowls, and still holds the NCAA record for most consecutive 100-yard
rushing ganmes, with 31.
Inhis four years, Ohio State had a 40-5-1 record, including a 3-0-1
record over Michigan.
The Michigan Daily: I've read that (legendary Ohio State football coach)
Woody Hayes would fire you up oil the Monday before you played Michigan by bring-
ingin a formerplayerto describe the significance of the rivalry. Whatwas aparticularly
memorable example of this
Griffin: During the course of the whole week before the Michigan game, he'd certainly
have forier players come iand talk vith ens about their experience with the Michigan game.
And the players that hewould bring in were pretty emotional about that experience, and itcame
through ahen they wOUIld talk to the team.
And one particular instance ott my first Michigan week that we had happened with a guy by
the name of Dave Whitfield (Ohio State defensive end, 1967-69).... He got to talk to the team,
and tears were comingout of his eyes.
And I looked aroundthe room and I saw the lookonother players'faces, and I just said,'Wow,
I mean. this thing is even biggerthan I thought. What have I gotten myself into?' Because itxwas
really an iemotional situation, and it was like people were ready to run out that room and play
the Mlichigan game right there ott that Monday. And I know that that's not what Coach Hayes
wanted atthattime, because lie likesto get yoU tp gradually for a game -hedon'tswant you tobe
readyto play thatganne on Monday, he wants you to be ready to play iton Saturday.
But it was very emotional and it gave me a real feel for what the game was all about. Dave
Whitfield did that.
The Michigan Daily: In your four years on the team, what was your
most memorable Michigan-Ohio State game moment?
Griffin: When people askyou about the games you played in and whatnot, they don't
usually ask about many of the other schools in the Big Ten. But the one you can be sure that
they're going to ask about is Michigan. How did you do against Michigan?
I' m proud to say that I never lost to Michigan. And that's something that I say, and I'm
very, very proud of that.
The last one we played at Michigan, 1975, we were tied for the Big Ten and Michigan had
to beat us in order to go to the Rose Bowl.... And theywere beatingnis - theywere beating us
pretty good. I think they were ahead 14-7 with four minutes to go.
And I'll never forget at that time ... when the offense went out on the field, we thought
this might be our last shot. (Ohio State quarterback Cornelius Greene) called the players
together and -we held hands in the huddle and said a little prayer,-and just asked the Lord to
give us strength to play the type of football we're capable of playing.
We went out there and started movingthe football. Scored a touchdown, tied it up 14-14.
Michigan probably got a little desperate because a tie would have kept us in the Rose Bowl,
and they started passing the football and threw an interception to my younger brother,
-(Ohio State cornerback) Ray (Griffin). And Ray took it down to about the 4- or 5-yard line
and we took it over again for another touchdown and we ended upwinningtthe game 21-14.
And that really stands out in my mind, and it shouldn't stand out in my mind, because I
had a streak of 31 straight 100-yard games goingnon, and Michigan stopped me from getting
100 yards that day, But the fact we won that game trumped the fact that I didn't get the 100
yards.

DESMOND HOWARD
Michigan wide receiver, 1989-91
Howhad no one thought to doit sooner?
Desmond Howard, Michigan's second Heisman Trophy winner, raced nnp
the Ohio State sideline on a punt return during the 1991 edition of The Game.
He stood in the end zone and briefly struck the iconic bronze statue's pose, thus
cementinghis place in Heisman lore. Howard went on to win the Heisman by the
largest manrgin in history at that time.
In his three years, Michigan had a 29-7 record, including a 3-0 record against
Ohio State..
The Michigan Daily: How much would you say theMichigan Ohio State rivalry
defined your playing days?
Howard: Well. that game was huge. It was the biggest thing in college football for us
outside of going to the Rose Bowl, and sometimes maybe even biggertthan the Rose Bowl.
It was as big as it gets, especially during the regular season. All eggs were in the basket during
that week and during that gane. It was as big as it gets, and it was the biggest rivalry in college
football, if not all sports.
The Michigan Daily: Inyour threevears on the team,whatwasyour most mem-
orable Michigan-Ohio State game moment?
Howard: well, we never lost to Ohio State. I don't know what it tastes like to lose to
the Buckeyes. I've never had any other feeling but happiness after playing Ohio State.
I guess the biggest moment for ue was taking the punt-return back for the touchdown and
striking the Heisnnan pose. That was probably the biggest moment because I was so frus-
trated during the game, because they were committed to not letting me catch a touchdown
because they played their safeties so far back and everything. So in an attempt to make a
play, I caught the ball when I shouldn't have caught it, which is inside the 10-yard line, and
taking it back for 93 yards for a touchdown. I was just trying to make a play, frustrated, and
it worked out for me.
