The Michigan women's soc-
cer team hasn't even had a full
24 hours of practice yet and it's
already the fittest team coach

Greg Ryan has seen in his time at
Ann Arbor.
On Wednesday, the Wolverines
began their first day of practice,
including fitness drills in the
morning, set plays in the after-
noon and a scrimmage at night.

They will begin playing exhibi-
tion games when-they host West-
ern Michigan on Tuesday.
"This is by far and away the fit-
test, fastest, most athletic team
we have had at Michigan," Ryan
said. "We were extremely fin and

fast last year, but even more so
this year.
"I've never had a team any-
where close to this fit in the col-
lege game."
Those are hig words from
Ryan, who has spent 20 years
coaching at the collegiate level,
including the last five at Michi-
gan. The Wolverines advanced to
the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tour-
nament last year and have had
three-straight winning seasons
under Ryan.
Aside from a serious commit-
ment to its summer training, Ryan
says this year's team is one of the
deepest all around. The Wolver-
ines welcome a strong incoming
class to add to that, one that Ryan
says is contributing to the team's
overall talent level. According to
Ryan, six of the team's top-10 fit-
test athletes are underclassmen.
But Michigan also returns nine
starters to a team that finished
third in the Big 10 and just one
penalty kick shy of advancing to
the Elite 8.
"If we can keep people healthy,
this is by far the deepest team
we have had, it's the most expe-
rienced team we've ever had, it's
the most talented team we've
ever had," Ryan said. "So it gives
us a chance to go to the bench and
use that talent, and bringtremen-
dous energy onto the field."
Up for grabs
The biggest question at prac-
tice continues to be how the
Wolverines fill the void at goal-
keeper after losing fifth-year
senior keeper, Hayley Kopmeyer.
Arguably Michigan's best goal-
keeper, Kopmeyer recorded more
saves (383), shutouts (27) and fin-
ished with a lower goals-against
average (0.96) than anyone in
program history.
Three contenders will vie for
the job until the regular season,
at which point Ryan will declare
a starter. Freshman Taylor Buck-
lin, sophomore Maddie Clarfield
and junior Zaryn Jennings are
all in contention, and the first day
left little indication of who would
get the nod.'
"I think they have to fight for
the starting position in preseason
because you don't want to go into
a season unsure of who's going

to play," Ryan said. "Hopefully,
somebody steps up and stands
out, just as Haley did."
Bucklin, who has played for
the Canadian national team at the
CONCACAFUnder-17 Women's
Championship aod the Under-17
Women's World Cup, comes in
as a highly-touted recruit out of
Greenwich, Conn., whom Ryan
has called a "very talented keep-
er."
Neither Clarfield nor Jennings
received much time in net last
year, as Kopmeyer carried the
Wolverines game after game.
"We're just going to let them
battle for the position and see
what happens," Ryan said. "So
far, for the first day, they look
good."
Defense dominates daily
The goalkeeper situation won't
be too pressingif the defense con-
tinues its strong play from last
year, and there's no reason to sus-
pect they wouldn't.
Last season, the defense
allowed a program best 17 goals
and recorded 13 shutouts, while
setting up an offense that racked
up 42 goals last season. Anchored
by senior captain Shelina Zador-
sky and fifth-year senior Holly
Hein, the defense should benefit
from an extra year to mesh.
"I think it's been really excit-
ing so far," Zadorsky. "We've
been able to get almost every-
one in a little earlier. We've been
playing and meshing well.
"It's a lot easier (to play togeth-
er) and everyone here is just real-
ly excited to get started."
The arrival of junior trans-
fer Olivia Brannon should also
strengthen the wall that is Michi-
gan's defense. Brannon, a premier
defender out of Virginia, will be
slowed by a knee injury according
to Ryan, but was out on the field
Wednesday.
With a perennial powerhouse
team like Penn State, who fin-
ished first last year in the Big
Ten, Michigan's defense will be
counted on from Day 1 to grab the
top spot.
"I think there is no reason why
we can't compete and win against
any team in the Big Ten," Ryan
said. "Saying it is one thing and
doing it is another."

Scholarships and aid
for undocumented
students next goal
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Two years ago this October,
a small group of University
students formed the Coalition
for Tuition Equality. The
following February, CTE held
its first in a line of protests over
more than a year - bringing
yellow shirts and posters to
protests at University's Board of
Regents meetings, the Fleming
Administration Building and
the intersection of State Street
and South University Avenue.
When the regents announced
new tuition guidelines last
month - which will grant
in-state tuition rates to many
undocumented students and
military veterans - Public
Policy junior CTE spokesman
Dan Morales said organizers
were proud of the progress
accomplished in a short period.
Only a few weeks later, CTE
has begun planning the next
steps in its crusade to expand
college access to undocumented
students. Meanwhile, Univer-
sity administrators prepare to
implement the new policy set to
take effect in January.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the Office of
the Registrar has been creating
new forms for each distinct
pathway to in-state tuition over
the past few weeks, as they field
inquiries from students asking
how they can take advantage of
the new policy.

Proppe creates 23
commissions to
take place of those
already established
By WILL GREENBERG and
AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
DailyStaffReporters
When Business senior Michael
Proppe, Central Student Govern-
ment president, issued executive
orders to establish 23 new com-
missions that upended previous
ones, he did not take into consid-
eration the input of the 52 elected
members of the Senate Assembly.
Twenty-four hours before the
commissions were established,
Proppe, a member of the youMich
party, circulated a document
written by himself and Public
Policy junior Bobby Dishell, CSG

vice president, that informed the
Senate Assembly representatives
of the changes that would take
place in the executive structure.
Though Speaker and Engi-
neering junior Andy Modelle and
Vice Speaker and LSA sophomore
Meagan Shokar, members of the
forUM party, and selected former
Commission Chairs were taken
into counsel about three weeks
before the new commissions came
into operation, they were asked to
maintain secrecy.
Hostile relations between par-
ties forUM and youMICH can be
traced back to presidential and
representative elections in March,
when youMICH filed election
code violations against forUM -
disqualifying LSA Juniors Chris
Osborn and Hayley Sakwa from
taking the presidential and vice
presidential seats despite garner-
ing a majority of the popular vote.
The debate surrounding com-

mission reorganization existed
months before Tuesday. In an
April lame-duck session of the
assembly, Proppe co-authored a
resolution that proposed the con-
solidation of 22 commissions into
18. The proposed consolidation of
the Diversity Affairs Commission
and the Minority Affairs Commis-
sion prompted four forUM repre-
sentatives, under the leadership
of CSG Representative and LSA
senior Chris Mays, to leave the
chambers, disrupting qurom and
leaving the body unable to pass
legislation.
Though the resolution was
tabled for later assembly meetings,
Public Policy junior Sam Dick-
stein, forUM Communications
& Marketing Director, said he
believed that the CSG Executive
Board was now exploiting a loop-
hole in the Constitution to avoid
representative opposition.

Kunselman, Eaton win Dem.
City Council primary vote

Beat out Grand and
Higgins for Wards
3 and 4 after 8.6
percent voter turnout
By TUI RA DEMAKER
Daily News Editor
Ann Arbor residents went to
the polls Tuesday to determine
the Democratic candidates for
the Ann Arbor City Council,
settling primary battles in both
Ward 3 and Ward 4.
Incumbent Stephen Kunselman
(D-Ward 3) was re-elected to run
for Ward 3 with 51.76 percent
over current Park Advisory
Commission Chair Julie Grand's
48.13 percent. Longtime
neighborhood activist Jack
Eaton won Ward 4, acquiring
62.47 percent of the vote over
incumbent Marcia Higgins'
(D-Ward 4) 37.28 percent. In
both races, write-in candidates
received less than one percent of
the vote.
Wards 3 and 4 are the only two
of Ann Arbor's five wards whose
incumbents were challenged in
Tuesday's primary.
Gathered at CUBS' A.C.
Sports Bar and Restaurant on
Tuesday night, Eaton and a
group of supporters expressed'
excitement as the results began
trickling in. Despite an initial
issue in Precinct 9, when the
polling machines appeared to
have temporarily malfunctioned,
the results from Ward 4's nine
precincts looked promising for
Eaton almost immediately. He
carried all precincts but the first,
which Higgins won by three
votes to Eaton's one.
"I'm just humbled that so manN'
people have put their trust in me."
he said after hearing the official
results. "We first have to realize
that Irm one of 11 votes on council
and I'm the junior member of
council but m going to work
hard to assert those priorities that
voters told me were important to
them when I went door-to-door."
Eaton's victory marks the
second time in two years

able to finish the race.
"You had to feel for him,"
LaPlant&said.
Couldthe 4x100-meterrelaystill
succeed without him? It's possible.
The order of runners would
need to be switched, the handoffs
reworked, the leadership replaced.
Was it likely?
"Not at all," Clarke said in May.
"I don't think so."
The 4x100-meter relay qualified
for the NCAA East Preliminaries

witha chance at advancing to the
Championships. Campbell couldn't
go to cheer on his teammates or
provide what he could do best after
having surgery days before. He sat
at home resting. Maybe he would
watch the race if he could find it
online somewhere.
The relay never succeeded with-
out him.
I may have fibbed when I said it
wasn't heartwarming.
Here is the story of an athlete
who walked on to the team with-
out expecting to be running for a

school. Here's the story ofsomeone
who spent five years training for
a chance to cement his name and
prove that running in college was
the right choice. Here's the story of
someone so close to seeing every-
thingcome together.
And that was enough to satisfy
Campbell.
"The fact that I've been able to
do this extracurricular activity and
excel at it in some shape or form,
that to me is just icing on the cake."
he said. "I've done what I needed to
do to position myself
"Track meant a lot of me, but the

end was coming up sooner rather
than later, and it just kind of ended
quicker than I thought."
This story doesn't end with the
injury, much like Campbell didn't
end his career as an athlete when
he came to Ann Arbor. He still
hasn't given up on running, either.
Recovery from a torn Achilles
can take up to 11 months, maybe
longer to return to the level at
which Campbell competed. He still
walks around with a boot on his
left foot.
In the mean time, Campbell has
moved to Miami to teach English

for Teach for America, a non-profit
organization that aims to eliminate
educational inequity. He's tossed
around coaching track and involv-4
ing students in athletics.
But that's all just part of the
larger plan.
"My plan for this Achilles is to get
it back to where I can sprint again,"
he said. "Once I got to the point
where I can sprint on my legs again, a
that to me, will feel really good.
"Then I'll have made it back."

Stephen Kunselman (D-Ward 3) celebrates winning the Democratic primary at Dorninick's Bar with supporters Tuesday.

that he's run in the Ward 4
Democratic primary. Last year
he lost to current councilwoman
Margie Teall (D-Ward 4) in a
close race. He attributed this
year's different outcome to
increased name recognition
among constituents.
"Last year I went to a couple
thousand doors, I shook hands,
I talked to people, I came within
20 votes," he said. "This year
I went out and talked to those
same people and some more and
they just got to know me over
time ... they're coming around
to the idea that I was a realistic
alternative."
Councilman Mike Anglin
(D-Ward 5) and University alum
Hatim Elhady, who ran for Ward
4 in 2009 as an LSA senior, were
among supporters gathered to
celebrate Eaton's victory. Anglin,
who will run for re-election
in November, said he became
involved in Eaton's campaign
wh te discovered that his own
seat Would be unopposed in the
primary.
Higgins did not return
requests for comment either on

her location during the election
or her thoughts on the race itself.
Kunselman's victory in Ward
3 is an end to what has been a
somewhat turbulent race against
Grand. She has run her campaign
with an emphasis on an ability to
communicate with constituents.
Grand has criticized Kunselman
for an alleged detachment
from constituents. Kunselman,
who had previously called
her campaign's strategies
"deceptive", responded with an
emphasis on issues as well as his
six years of experience on City
Council.
"I communicate with my
constituents quite regularly,"
he said while celebrating his
victory with his campaign and
supporters at Dominick's Bar
on Tuesday night. "You know,
anytime they e-mail me, any
time they call me, I talk to them
and I communicate with them."
Kunselman said he will
continue to focus otr the
issues that he feels most
affects residents, including
infrastructure, police and fire.
He also said he plans to continue

his fight for the protection of
the neighborhoods which he
said has suffered from recent
zoning changes that have led to
increased high-rise buildings.
Grand did not return phone
calls following her loss, but did
say on Tuesday morning that her
campaign and supporters would
be following the race from Sava's
Restaurant on State Street. It is
unclear whether or not she will
run in future races.
Tuesday's results culminate
months of campaigning for
the four candidates and while
Kunselman will still have
a challenger in the race for
the general election, Ann
Arbor's 90 percent Democratic
population means that securing
the council seat will likely not
be as competitive as Tuesday's
race. The city does not hold a
Republican primary.
"This was the election,"
Kunselman said. "tm actualiy
looking forrward to the general
election because my opponent
Sam Devarti is actually a good
family friend.'

to agony: Matt Campbell's tragic end to a career

Researchers find
donor personality
a factor for patients

By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
This isn't the heartwarming
story you're looking for.
There's no climactic finish.
There's no record broken or lasting
legacy. There isn't even the agony
of defeat or coming within inches
of victory.
For Matt Campbell there were
tears shed, a surgery to sit through
and a moment in front of his com-
puter to follow what could have
.hcen his season.
But it needs to be told. Really, it
deserved to be told months ago.
After all, his story, according
to his biography on the Athletic
Department's website, ends like
this: "Helped the 4x100-meter
relay qualify for the finals (40.34)
before tearing his Achilles tendon
in the 200-meter prelims."
That's it. It's easy to glide over
that and not recognize the weight
and the gravity that it carries. Of
course it doesn't catch your eye
ight away - that someone tore
their Achilles. There are hundreds
of thousands of people who tear
their Achilles every year and the
injury is most common in runners.
But the former men's track
and field sprinter won't be able to
return. He wasn't even on the team
in August before he began run-
ning as a member of the team. And
he was so close to accomplishing
something he couldn't have imag-
ined.
Don't let me fool you into think-
ing his story is that of any other
walk-on. It doesn't end with
unimaginable dreams being real-
ized like so many other stories.
It's more than that.
Matt Campbell was fast com-
ing out of Rochester High School,
but he'll be the first to tell you he
wasn't "that fast." Even though he
was faster than many of his team-
mates in high school, he was still
just an above-average runner who
won two regional championships
in the 400-meter dash and was
named an All-State selection in the
4x100-meter relay.
Campbell didn't have the indi-
vidual accolades of a state champi-
onship, or school record in a sport
where the individual accolades
separate the best from the rest of

the pack. But he knew that his time
running wasn't up.
There wereother,smallerNCAA
Division III schools that offered
him an opportunity to run, but they
weren't what Campbell was look-
ing for. So, like thousands of other
students, he applied as a preferred
walk-on, and entered the program
that way.
"I just went for it," he said.
There was no scholarship
for Campbell and certainly no
acclaim when he entered school.
He ran during the indoor season
of his freshman year without turn-
ing heads, filling in wherever he
received a chance. He was red-
shirted his outdoor season.
Of course, that doesn't mean it
slowed him in the slightest.
"I justkept on looking at people I
wanted to be faster than, or people
I wanted to be like," Campbell said.
"I kept on trying to be like them."
Times dropped, top-10 finish-
es piled up, the number of races
increased and Campbell's impor-
tance jumped in the span of a year.
On a team that needed depth in its
sprint squadron, Campbell's charm
and never-ending work ethic made
him a natural selection to fill relay
teams or contested spots in open
'events.
"You want to come to prac-
tice every day when you see Matt
Campbell," said former Michigan
coach Fred LaPlante. "He's atten-
tive, he's going to listen, he gets
your message, he's not afraid to ask
questions, he's going to support his
teammates. All the things that you
want."
By the end of his junior year,
still a redshirt sophomore in the
outdoor season, Campbell had
qualified for the NCAA Outdoor
Championships as a member of the
4x100-meter relay. The team fin-
ished with an All-American hon-
orable mention, but no matter - it
was already more than he was sup-
posed to contribute.
And he continued to contribute
as a leader. Not as the vocal, in-
your-face leader, but the one that
told you the truth and then led by
example.
Against Ohio State, also known
as "The Dual," you could see what
made Campbell such a polar-
izing leader. After winning the

Mays said while he did not
dispute Proppe's executive powers
to establish new commissions, he
believed that convening available
assembly members to discuss
commission matters would have
been appropriate given the history
between the two parties.
However, recent developments
have proven the executive commis-
sions to be open to Senate Assembly
input. Through a new provision that
allows studentsto pitch ideas for the
creation of new commissions, Mays
will be working with Proppe to
establish a commission that would
encourage more University interac-
tion with the Detroit area. ,
Wednesday, the Executive
Board opened up applications for

Commission Chair positions.
Hays said forUM would work
with the board to nominate suitable
candidates for the positions.
"We're going to have an open,
positive dialogue about this," Hays
said. "That's what forUM's all
about and that's what we've always
wanted to do - have transparency
in government."
Moving forward, Proppe said
meetings will need to be held to
determine whether last year will
be considered a valid year for the
expired commissions.
"We'll work to correct and move
forward," Proppe said. "We can't
change what happened (last year)
but I'm really happy to work with
the Commission chairs."

200-meter dash, Campbell jogged
around the building to cool down
like the other competitors. Yet
Campbell wasn't cooling down, but
warming up for his final race of the
day - the 4x400-meter relay.
As he battled fatigue, Campbell
bolted out of the starting blocks
with 30 minutes of rest. His legs
chugging in short steps like the
earlier race, and Campbell held on
to second place, hoping to hit the
second gear. But the second gear
wasn't enough and Campbell fell
behind.
He continued to swing his arms,
the grimace across his face failing
to acknowledge defeat. The time to
quit would have been well before
the race started, when the Buck-
eyes had wrapped up the meet, but
there was Campbell, running on
fumes.
Exasperated, he stretched his
arm to pass the baton, and cheered
for the rest of the relay. His team-
mates watched on.
"If you work hard, it's just one
less variable in how good you're
going to be," LaPlante said. "There
are a lot of great instances out
there, and to point those out to the
team - he's just a great example for
people."
16 ***
Michigan's 4x100-meter relay
record was set in 1978, when Doug
Hennigar, Charles CroutherArnett
Chisholm and James Grace ran a

39.92. The next two fastest times
were run in 40 seconds or slower.
Matt Campbell and the 4x100-
meter relay team were three-tenths
of a second away from breaking
that record.
He led the 4x100-meter relay
through the season, perfecting the
exchange of the baton, the timing
of his first step and the lunge at
the end. Campbell and his team-
mates - sophomore Codie Nolan,
senior Aaron Taylor and junior
Justin Clarke - had dropped time
slowly and steadily along a path set
to break the record as the season
wound down.
For many, the Big Ten Out-
door Championships in Columbus
would be the last chance to com-
pete for the year. For Campbell
and the 4x100-meter relay, it was
a stepping stone before the NCAA
preliminary meet and the NCAA
Outdoor Championships. Two
races before a shot at scoring points
on the national stage and three
total to break the school record.
Pain is inevitable in track.
Campbell wasn't surprised
when he started feeling pain in
his Achilles during the season. It
became chronic, but nothing he
hadn't felt before.
He sat down in the starting
blocks for the preliminary heat of
the 200-meter dash at the Big Ten
championships, in spite of the pain,

after successfully qualifying in the
4x100-meter relay earlier.
"I was confident it wasn't going
to be a problem at Big Tens," Camp-
bell said. "It hurt after the 4x100,
but I was loosened it up and was
ready to go."
So he went on it. Out of the start-
ing blocks he came, pushing off just
as the gun sounded - just as years
of experience had taught him.
Around the turn he came, running
near the front of the pack, his right

Survey shows organ
recipients more likely
to prefer givers with
similar characteristics
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
It's not every day that a Sher-
lock Holmes story inspires an
important psychological study.
When University researchers
began discussing "The Adven-
ture of the Creeping Man," in
which a youth-seeking professor
starts acting like a monkey after
using a drug derived from mon-
keys, they became interested in
the belief that inner bodily sub-
stances can affect personality
characteristics.
Researchers from the Depart-
ment of Psychology studied how
people felt about receiving an
organ donation from someone
who is different from them in
any way, and examined whether
they believed receiving an organ
could change a recipient's per-
sonality traits to be more similar
to that of a donor.
Psychology Prof. Susan
Gelman said her team were
particularly 'interested in
how responses from Indians
and Americans might differ,
because of the heightened
cultural concerns surrounding
contamination in India and
the country's history with
transplant operations.
"There was a period of time
where you could pay to get a
transplant, and that led to ter-
rible situations where somebody
might give up an organ just for
the money," Gelman said.
She also said the team expect-
ed India's rigid caste system to
affect thoughts on transplants
more so than in a country like
the United States. However,
there were more similarities

than expected between respon-
dents from both countries.
Participants were asked -to
rank the desirability of a given
organ donor based on Character-
istics such as gender, age, back-
ground and sexual orientation.
They were also asked if they
were looking for characteristics
they see in themselves - positive
or negative - and were asked
to state their beliefs concern-
ing whether or not a transplant
would cause a recipient's per-
sonality or behavior to become
more like that of their donor.
Ultimately, the study found
that people are not in favor of
receiving an organ from a per-
son who is different from them,
or from someone who they per-
ceive as having negative charac-
teristics. The desire to.receive a
donation from a similar person
appeared to be the most wide-
spread, but receiving a donation
from a perceived "good" person
was also an acceptable option.
A blood transfusion scenario
yielded similar results: the study
showed that people much prefer
to receive blood from someone
who is similar to them.
"This was interesting, and
surprising," Meyer said. "Blood
transfusions are pretty common,
but people have this sort of
discomfort about getting blood
from someone different from
them."
The researchers noted that
neither the gender nor country
of origin of participants seemed
to be differentiating factors. The
same beliefs were found equally
in men, women, Indians and
Americans.
Gelman said the question that
yielded the strongest opinions
were related to cross-species
transplants.
"Animaltransplantswere seen
as particularly troublesome,"
she said.
Though the transplant of a
full animal organ into a human

has never been done successfully
and is still a heavily debated topic
in the medical field, Gelman said
receiving even part of an organ
- like a heart valve from a pig -
was generally looked down upon
by participants.
Rackham student Sarah
Stilwell, who also co-authored
the study, wrote in an e-mail
interview that that there are
upsides and downsides to
xenotransplantation, or animal-
to-human transplants.
"There are a ,tremendous
amount of individuals in need
of transplants, but a widespread
human organ shortage in clinical
implantation," she wrote.
"However, there is a very high
risk of organ rejection due to
the foreign animal tissue being
rejected by the body's immune
system, even with anti-rejection
medication."
With the final publication of
this study, the team is moving
on to examine these beliefs in
children.
"Children lack formal scien-
tific knowledge that would be
incompatible with intuitions
about transplants," Meyer said.
While participants were
asked to provide demographic
information, the study did not
take into consideration medical
past. Namely, it did not pointedly
examine how beliefs change
when a person is actually in need
of a transplant or has received a
transplant.
Small samples of people who
have had organ transplants
have reported that these
people experience "a nagging
worry" that they will take on
characteristics of their donor.
Gelman said behavioral
changes can result from having
a major surgery more so than the
actual organ.
"We don't think there's any
good evidence for it, but just
because there's no evidence
doesn't mean that it's not true."

ass information
Past course syllabi should be available to all students
As the summer comes to a close, students are anticipating their
fall classes. They signed up for many of these classes back
in April - but they likely knew very little about the classes
themselves before signing up. Though information from friends, pro-
fessor ratings at Rate My Professor and the paltry class description
listed in course guides gives students a very rough idea of what their
classes will be like, this isn't enough. Students should know more
about their classes before they have to sign up for them. University
administration should require course instructors to make past syllabi
available to students well before we have to sign up for classes as well
as to make abundantly clear what materials are required for a class
prior to its start.

Life outside

t's truly been a "Wet Hot Ameri-
can Summer" - just under very
different circumstances than

the movie.
One of the worst
allergy seasons
in recent memory
and the erratic
weather have made
one of the great
pastimes occasion-
ally difficult to
enjoy - spending
time outdoors.
Working at a

DEREK
WOLFE

summer camp, most of my day is spent
outside. Besides meals, I'm either at a
beach, field or amphitheater doing all
kinds of activities. Unless it's raining -
a common occurrence this summer -
times inside are extremely short-lived.
But, there's another aspect of camp
that makes for a great way to experi-
ence the outdoors. By actually camp-
ing. Yes, with the tents and everything.
Twice this summer through my job
at camp, I've staffed a trip that travels
across Michigan's upper peninsula -
yes, it really does exist. I - and nearly
40 other campers and staff - drove
to Newberry, Munising and Han-
cock, and then topped it off with a
morning on Mackinac Island. Rather
than staying at hotels, we stayed at
various campsites ranging from state
parks and Kampgrounds Of America
to private ones. We also cooked our
own meals and entertained ourselves
with card games, conversations- and
S'mores - that's a graham cracker,
chocolate and marshmallow sand-
wich, for the uninformed.
For five days we traveled by coach
bus. At each stop we made we got into a
routine of settingup camp and bringing
enthusiasm from place to place. With
everything that went on - all that was
discussed above - by the end of the trip,
it's clear that the group became signifi-
cantly closer than at the beginning.
In short, camping builds community.
Jason Tisdale, a co-counselor of
mine, explained the bond-building
ability of camping to me, specifically
for kids. "Every experience is special
and significant its own way. Extraor-
dinary, lifelong memories and build-
ing new, unbreakable communities are
the foundation of camping. This is why
kids will come back to camp summer
after summer, and sometimes never
truly leave it."

But this also goes . for everyone,
includingthe smallest families and cou-
ples on a weekend getaway.
Camping brings camaraderie. The
state of Michigan has well over 100
state and national parks that contain
campgrounds. And many of the camp-
sites are in very close proximity to one
another. Especially on the busy holi-
day weekends, it's commonplace for
fellow campers to meet, talk and learn
about each other's lives. And because
the goal of most campers is to leave
technology behind, conversation is
often the only form of entertainment
- unless the group is fortunate enough
to have someone musically talented.
This is why the bonding happens.
In short,
camping builds
community.
Camping is a lesson on indepen-
dence and responsibility. Packing
for trips has to be done efficiently
and correctly. On my trip, the camp-
sites were only near small towns that
might not have carried the necessary
equipment in case of an emergency, so
it's important not to forget anything.
And of course, there's also no one
else to cook meals and clean up - you
only have you. The feeling of choos-
ing when to wake up, when to eat and
what to do is exhilarating in a world
that often follows a rigorous schedule.
The health benefits also shouldn't
be ignored - mentally and physically.
Camping provides the opportunity
to exit the comfort zone, which I dis-
cussed in my last column. The fresh
air is powerful along with the reduced
stress of justbeing outside.
Comedian Daniel Xosh has said,
"Camping is not fun. It's just what
poor people do for vacation." But that
couldn't be further from the truth. Not
wanting to spend to a weekend in a tent
rather a hotel is understandable. I admit
sleeping on the floor doesn't always feel
great. But if you really want, renting a
recreational vehicle is always an option.
I promise - camping's worthwhile.

ceaselessly until the words dis-
solved into shouts and guitar riffs.
The audience wasn't sure whether
to be horrified at his bad behavior
or excited by the elevated inten-
sity of his performance, but there
were a few collective gasps when
it appeared as though the beloved
singer was literally on the edge of
falling to his demise.
Meanwhile, in the VIP section at
the side of the stage, a woman who
could have very well been Lana
Del Rey in 40 years (subtext: Her
face didn't move, and an airplane
could have landed on her lips) was
dancing like nothing I'd ever seen
before, flailing jiggling arms and
shimmying immovable breasts to
the encouraging shouts from the
crowd: "You get it, Drunk Mom!" "I
love you, Drunk Mom!"
That night, on the other side of
the park, a more subdued fanfare
was dedicated to The Postal Ser-
vice, playing songs from their 2003
album, Give Up. Death Cab's Ben
Gibbard ran the show, sharing the
stage with Rilo Kiley's Jenny Lewis,
Jimmy Tamborello and Mynabird's
Laura Berhenn. The band per-
formed as if they had never been on
hiatus, with Gibbard's vocals telling
earnest stories and Lewis support-
ing him with her dreamy, beautiful
croons. The performance had an
air of intimacy unparalleled by any
other performance I had seen at
Lolla, and was the perfect ending
for the night.
Sunday: The Michigan
Difference
When I wandered into the park
Sunday morning, I was greeted by
the sounds of Alex Clare. To the
surprise of most, Clare actually
has more songs than his hit, "Too
Close." His album, Lateness of the
Hour, is peppered with softer, more
forgiving songs that never made it
to the radio scene, my favorite of
which being "Hummingbird."
On the other side of the park,
I was welcomed by the familiar-
ity of an old favorite, Tegab and
Sara. The duo exceeded my long-
awaited expectations with solid
harmonies and an amazing stage
rapport, which can only be attrib-
uted to the fact that they are twin

sisters and have been performing
together since 1998. The two spoke
to the audience and each other in a
way that made us feel as though we
were sitting in their living room,
listening to a private concert with
sisterly banter. "It is such a lovely
day," Tegan said to the crowd. "We
performed at Lolla in 2005, and
it was so hot. I remember looking
over at Sara and she waved at me,
left the stage and never came back!
She couldn't take the heat. So this is
our comeback, we'll see if Sara can
make it!"
The pair played a smattering of
old and new albums, showingoffcthe
seamless ability to play off of each
other with back-and-forth duets,
such as "Now I'm All Messed Up"
from their latest album. As their set
drew to a close, Tegan teased her
sister more about the 2005 debacle:
"Look Sara, there's a sign that says
'Sara Will Make It'! The people
believe in you!"
After an effortless performance
by the alternative group Alt-J, (fun
fact: when you press Alt and J on
a keyboard, you get a triangle, the
band's logo. Makes more sense now,
doesn't it?) I headed to the much-
anticipated Vampire Weekend. Peo-
ple were already gathering, wearing
theirbest dancingshoes for the feel-
good summer time music. Hits like
"Diane Young" and "One (Blake's
GotANew Face)",had even the most
unenthusiastic festival-goers bop-
ping as the sun set over the stage
and the city of Chicago.
Leaving Lollapalooza is a bit
like leaving summer camp, in that
it's strange to leave a world you've
been so engrossed in for so long.
As I walked down the path from
Grant Park, a voice slurred behind
me, "Aren't you so glad to get this
damn thing off?" I turned and was
greeted by a drunken man in a tank
top, pulling at his wristband. "Wait,
what the hell does this mean?" he
asked, pointing at my media pass.
After explaining that I was from
Michigan, he exclaimed, "No fuck-
ing way!" as he tripped over cracks
in the sidewalk. "I'm from Ann
Arbor! I went to UMich man! Go
blue!" He stumbled off into the dis-
tance, joining crowds of tired fest-
goers who were all Lolla'ed out, at
least for this year.

As far as action movies go, you
really can't get a more generic
title than "2 Guns." It's your
standard action
flick and does
nothing to pro-
pel the genre 2 Guns
forward; how-
ever, it takes AtQuality16.
nods from some and Rave
of the genre's Universal Pictures
greatest staples
to create a vio-
lent and surprisingly enjoyable
summer movie experience.
The film opens with Denzel
Washington ("Flight") and Mark
Wahlberg ("Pain & Gain") as fast-
talking, quick-witted drug dealers
seated ina small restaurant to dis-
cuss just how to rob the bank next
door. It's a scene reminiscent of
the opening minutes of "Pulp Fic-
tion," a modest but effective ges-
ture given the pulpy atmosphere
pervading the film. Washington's
Bobby Trench plays it smoothly
but safely, calculating the details
of every scenario, and Wahlberg's
flirtatious Marcus "Stig" Stigman
is a bit reckless but also brilliant
with a gun.
It turns out that Bobby is
undercover DEA and Stig is Navy
Intelligence, but neither knows
the other is with the government.
It's only after their robbery goes

wrong that each learns of the
other's affiliations. Soon, these
ebony-and-ivory thunder buddies
are on the run from a rogue Navy
assassin (James Marsden, "Robot
and Frank"), a pissed-off Mexican
drug lord (Edward James Olmos,
"The Green Hornet") and, steal-
ing the show, a twisted cowboy
named Earl (Bill Paxton, "Hay-
wire").
The story, based on the comic
of the same name by Steven
Grant, suffers from its overly
complicated structure, occupied
with too many key players and
too many plot twists. But Wash-
ington and Wahlberg are down-
right fantastic; their interplay is
so captivating, it's hard to resist
their charm.
Director Baltasar Kormakur
("Contraband") makes his stylis-
tic choices carefully, utilizing an
occasional slow-motion flourish
and gritty camerawork. The film
certainly looks terrific, and the
action scenes are well choreo-
graphed, especially the climactic
final showdown ("You looked so
badass," Stig tells Bobby).
"2 Guns" pays homage to those
action films that came before
it, from the aforementioned
"Pulp Fiction" reference to "The
Matrix"-style slow motion and
the spaghetti Western Mexican
standoff to the "Lethal Weapon"
buddy-cop premise, but at times,
it feels tiresome. This is especial-

ly evident when Kormakur tries
to bringsome sincerity to the film
by showing us Bobby's relation-
ship with his sort-of girlfriend,
played by Paula Patton ("Mission
Impossible - Ghost Protocol"),
a fellow DEA agent. The actors
give it their all, but the scenes
feel out of place, almost forcesd
into the story to show that there's

something more to the action.
And there is something more
to this world - Kormakur sim-
ply failed to explore it. "2 Guns"
exists neither in our time nor.
any time, but is instead a strange
burlesque of past and present,
where violence is the standard
and loyalty is given only to the
man fighting next to you. It's a
world that deserves true explora-
tion and perhaps one day will be
explored; in that sense, the film
is a letdown. But, with as bad a
name as "2 Guns," we could have
gotten a whole lot worse. Don't
judge this film by its title - it
deserves a look.

Currently, schools at the Uni-
versity release information per-
taining to courses in a variety of
ways. For example, the course
guide for the Ross School of
Business incorporates its own
syllabi database that is reserved
for Ross students and some LSA
departments have made old syl-
labi for their classes available on
its website. A similar database
should be made available across
all colleges, as the brief blurbs
that many schools and colleges
currently have up on their web-
sites don't even come close to
giving students enough infor-
mation about their classes. It
should include old syllabi, text-
book lists and a rough outline
of how the class is taught and
graded, but more importantly,
it should all be available when
each school releases its course
guide - long before students'
enrollment dates come around.

Moreover, class descrip-
tions should clearly state which
textbooks are required for
each class. Many students have
learned to simply hold off on
buying their textbooks until
classes start, anticipating that
they won't need some of the
listed books. The current policy
requires professors to list books
along with the course descrip-
tions, but it doesn't seem like
they take the policy very seri-
ously. Having course instruc-
tors list only the books they
know they will use in the course
and indicate others as "pos-
sible" - perhaps by putting an
asterisk next to them on Wol-
verine Access -is a relatively
simple fix to a problem that
causes many headaches.
These changes would
put an increased burden on
instructors, and it's under-
standable that their courses

may not be fully planned
out before course guides are
available. But these changes
would make it far easier for
students to try to plan their
careers at the stressful end-of-
semester periods. As it accumu-
lates syllabi and records of class
material, the database would
also provide information that
could be useful to both students
and professors. Central Student
Government has already lob-
bied University administration
to require professors to provide
more class information to stu-
dents before classes start, and it
should continue to do so.
Students deserve to have as
much information at our finger-
tips as possible when picking
classes. A database of past syl-
labi and requiring instructors to
provide more course informa-
tion during the class selection
process would be invaluable for

NOUR SABANI F
Switching sides

Three crazy days
at Chicago's largest
music festival
By PAIGE PFLEGER
Daily Arts Writer
When writing about a three-day
festival attended by thousands, it's
difficult to find a place to begin.
So many things could make great
introductions - the five-foot nin-

squeak of a girl asking if we've seen
her friend Mary, getting mauled
by Lana Del Rey fans, something
a man said on the "L," a conversa-
tion from one frat br to the next
about Major Lazer and getting
ass, or even drunken performers
terrifying sober fans. But, it's best
not to start with your best stories
first. Instead, what I present to you
are stories in chapter-like install-
ments, with a special treat at the
end for those of you patient enough
to get there.

Friday: Attack of the Floral
Headbands
When first arriving at Lolla-
palooza, I feltlike a freshmen in col-
lege again. I asked about 30 people
where I was supposed to be going
and then still managed to get lost.
I was taken aback by the droves of
girls in floral headbands, thinking
maybe it was the new indie thing to
do and I missed the memo (in real-
ity it was basically a gang sign, but
more to come on that topic soon). I
drifted around the crowded streets
until I heard something familiar
- the Smith Westerns. Walking
to the stage, my Toms were slowly
consumed by mud puddles dotting
the ground (RIP, Toms). Smith
Westerns closed out their set with
fan favorite, "Weekend," and the
crowd dispersed.
Being a Fleet Foxes fan, I then
headed over to watch J. Till-
man, Fleet Foxes' former drum-
mer, perform under his new stage
name, Father John Misty. Till-
man himself was one of the most
entertaining artists I saw at the
festival - his sarcastic wit and dry
cynicism was lost on most of the
attendees, but he spent a fair time
belittling the festival, with quips
such as, "Lollapalooza! I want to
ask you how you're doing in my
best I'm-playing-a-festival-camp-
counselor voice and I want you to
go, 'eh' as apathetically as possible.
Got it?" or "I would be remiss not
to thank Lolla's number one spon-
sor, unicorns." His set was strong,
performing "Hollywood Forever
Cemetery Sings," "Funtimes in
Babylon" and even new songs such
as "I Love You, Honey Bear," ironi-
cally about death and dying.
The rain continued to fall, but
the fans barely noticed, clapping
their hands to the indie star's low-
key, rock-infused music. "I heard
a girl say fuck the rain earlier,"
Tillman said to the audience, ciga-
rette in one hand and mic in the
other. "But ya know what? The
rain makes it so we can have civi-
lization, civilization makes it so we
can have group think and group
think makes it so shitty music can
be huge." The audience laughed,

cheering him on. "So you know
what? I love the rain."
Afterward, I headed tothe Grove
stage - appropriately named for its
location in the middle of a wooded
area of the park. I was basically
giddy to see Scottish band Fright-
ened Rabbit. I got to the stage just
in time to secure a good spot close
to the front. Surveying the audi-
ence around me, I was surprised
at the demographic - mostly tiny
white girls with floral headbands.
After further investigation, I dis-
covered that Lana Del Rey was the
next act on the stage after FR, and I
was the only person in the immedi-
ate vicinity there for just the band.
Despite obnoxious shouts for Lana
from the audience, the foursome
rocked out their set with a good
mix of old and new songs. Scott
Hutchinson, the band's lead vocal-
ist and lyricist, even dropped some
adorable Scottish banter about the
song "Late March, Death March":
"It's like, you go to bed after get-
ting in a fight with your mate. You
wake up, shake hands ... or fuck,
whichever you're into."
Immediately after FR closed
out its set, the headbanded bandits
closed in on the stage, sandwich-
ing their five-foot bodies on top of
each other like shrimpy sardines. It
seems that Lana fans have an obses-
sion with the atmospheric croon-
ing of their own personal goddess,
and this obsession caused them
to cut down everything standing
between them and the stage. All
floral head bands, teenage angst
and sharp elbows, the mob was
merciless, and even when I tried to
escape, they clawed their way past
me, ripping my backpack and leav-
ing me shaken and a bit worse for
wear. That was when I learned my
first Lolla lesson: beware of anyone
crowned with a floral headband.
They may appear like the peace-
loving, flower-power girls of the
'70s, but they are heartless and
have sharp nails. That is all.
Saturday: Drunken
Shenanigans
Saturday's lineup promised a
lower-key affair, with indie high-

lights from Ben Howard, Local
Natives, The National, Lumineers
and good-old classic Postal Ser-
vice (if you never loved the Postal
Service, you're wrong). At Local
Natives, I found my way up to
the front of the stage, only a row
back. The people lining the fence
had been waiting for Mumford &
Sons' 8:15 p.m. show since 11 a.m.,
which surprised me. I see the draw
in Mumford's folk-inspired rep-
ertoire, but I personally wouldn't
wait an entire day to see them.
Again, I was one of the only people
in the vicinity actually there for
the smaller names that preceded
the closers.
The LA indie rockers, Local
Natives, delivered an entirely
impressive live show. The musi-
cians and the fans were equally
invested in the performance, with
the band feeding off the audience's
enthusiasm. The three-part har-
monies were flawless and executed
effortlessly. New songs like "Break-
ers" off of the album Hummingbird
showed off the musicianship of the
band members, and old favorites
like "Airplanes" and "Sun Hands"
were given new life through the
live performance.
Next up was The National. The
show began as expected, with the
sleepy droning of lead singer Matt
Berninger supported by an impres-
sive backing band: piano, drums,
guitars, trumpet and trombone.
The set was eerily similar to that
of Radiohead's from Bonnaroo
2012, with live footage of the per-
formance fed through filters, then
projected onto a big screen in the
background. After a few songs,
Berninger pulled out "Afraid of
Everyone" from High Violet, as
well as a bottle of champagne.
By "Squalor Victoria," the singer
was clearly intoxicated, scream-
ing lyrics to the point of inaudibil-
ity. Berninger continued his bad
behavior, climbing across the stage
with his drink and the mic, falling
backwards onto the Lollapalooza
banners adorning the sides of the
stage, and even throwing him-
self into the audience during "Mr.
November," screaming "I won't
fuck us over, I'm Mr. November"

I'm only 19 years old, but about six
months ago - over Winter Break - I
had what some would call a mid-life
crisis. I finally dropped the pre-med
plans I carried for most of my life,
and committed to the dangerous
waters of humanities, social sciences
and academia. .
Mywinterschedule consisted not
of Animal Physiology and Organic
Chemistry II like I had planned,
but of Rhetorical Activism and the
Civil Rights Movement as well as
a seminar on Cities in the Global
South - classes that matched up
with my newly declared major and
minor, English Language and Lit-
erature and International Studies.
As word spread among my fam-
ily and friends, I received a whole
spectrum of reactions - there were
the sympathizers who expressed
disappointment at my wasted
"intelligence" (clearly these people
didn't see my grades the semes-
ter I took Organic Chemistry), the
new-found allies (fellow students
of Humanities and Social Science)
who cheered and gave me high-fives
and the snide science majors who
smirked and assumed I couldn't
handle the heat in the lab. Most of
all, though, I was bombarded with
this question: "What are you going
to do with that degree?"
It's not that I mind the ques-
tion. In fact, it's nice when people
are interested in learning about my
goals and future aspirations. Rath-
er, what bothers me is the tone of
skepticism that often accompanies
it. Because sometimes when peo-
ple ask, "What are you going to do
with that?" I can almost see them
pitifully imagining my penniless,
struggling, "wasted" future.
I have to admit - I imagined it
too. Many times I think it would be
much easier to stick to a tried and
tested career track and save myself
the trouble of worrying about a sta-
ble job market and income. But then
I think about the world we live in.
The world we live inis one where
the state of the environment is the
worst it's ever been, where the ice
caps are melting, the polar bears
are dying and the wildlife is
becoming extinct.
The world we live in is one where
hunger is prevalent, and the gap
between the very rich and the very
poor is extreme, and continues to
widen. It's one where people don't
have enough to eat, let alone to
afford adequate shelter or luxuries
like education.

The world we live in is one where
racism and prejudice are alive and
well. It's one where mainstream
media and pop culture perpetuate
stereotypes and profit off of divi-
sive, marginalizing rhetoric.
The world we live in is one where
politics are corrupt and driven
by money. It's one where tyrants
and oppressive leaders hold power
while the people demand justice
and liberation.
The world we live in has a lot of
problems - problems that won't
be solved by tried and tested solu-
tions. We need solutions based in
justice, integrity and strength of
will. We need actions driven by
sincere intentions, teamwork and
unified visions. Perhaps most of all,
though, we need creativity.
The issues we face today are com-
plex - they require people with
bright minds, and, more importantly,
the passion and energy to use them.
Shouldn't we be encouraging this
generation of high school and college
students to pursue what interests
them, in the hopes that their love for
a subject - whatever it is - will give
them the momentum to use it to cre-
ate a positive change? Shouldn't we
value the risk-takers, the ones who
prioritize big dreams and revolu-
tionary ideas, over money and stabil-
ity? Whether it's writing, art, music,
chemistry or math, every discipline
has the potential to solve a prob-
lem - directly or indirectly, inter-
personally or structurally.
Yes, it's harder to find a well-pay-
ing job as an English major than as
a doctor. And I probably will have to
be in school longer than an engineer
would in order to receive a promo-
tion. But rather than meeting these
less clear-cut academic pursuits
with doubt, let's challenge ourselves
to become confident with the idea
that it doesn't matter what some-
one does - what matters is that it's
something the individual believes
in, will become a leader in, be their
best at and employ to improve life
for future generations. Rather than
place implicit pressure on students
to choose a career that will assure
comfort and stability, let's culti-
vate a norm where discomfort and
instability are admired, because we
understand that if we want to be
comfortable in the long run, we need
to have the courage early on to be
inspired and to take the risk of fol-
lowing our hearts - all the way.

A note to igno ramus

Dear Ignoramus,
Hello. I hope you are
doing well. I'm writing
you not only
to check up on
you, but also
to explain
something
to you that I
don't think
you fully
understand. PAIGE
I overheard PFLEGER
you talk-
ing to your
friend the other night at that
party we were at. You might
not even remember, because I
know that everyone was drink-
ing by that point and you may
have been quite drunk. How-
ever, I remember what you said
and it isn't something so easily
forgotten by me - nor will it be
forgotten by him.
I just want to bring this back
into your memory because it's
important for you to recognize
that the guy you called a faggot
is subject to judgment in almost
every area of his life because he
is gay, and the last place he needs
to receive such ignorance would
be from somebody like you -
with your heterosexual ideals
and your majority standing.
Maybe you misspoke, maybe I
misheard, but the next time you
are at a party I hope you'll realize
that regardless of how you feel
about the situation, your igno-
rance is best left unsaid. Openly
airing your discomfort with the
situation isn't going to change
it, regardless of how much you'd
like it to. Being gay is still going
to be acceptable in society, with
or without your support. Belit-
tling others because of their

homosexuality isn't going to
change anything, and any dis-
comfort you feel about the situ-
ation lies in your own insecurity
or naivete.
The thing about you is that you
know nothing about what that kid.
has to face in his everyday life. If
his parents had found out he was
gay, maybe he would have ended
up on the streets. Had his room-
mate found out he was gay, maybe
he'd be bullied. Had his boss
found out he was gay, maybe he'd
be fired. Though beinggay is gain-
ing acceptance in the public eye,
people like you still have preju-
dices against it and grow up to be
the parents who kick him out, the
roommate who beat him up, the
boss who fires him. You, however,
don't live in any kind of fear. Your
life has been shrouded in the bliss-
fulness of being ignorant.
I'm sorry if any of this seems
scathing, but I felt it my place to
say something because I didn't
stand up for him and he isn't one
to confront people, no matter how
much they may have wronged
him. That is one of the hard-
est parts to recognize - it isn't
that he can't confront people, it's
that he's met your ignorance one
too many times and the fight has
deflated inside of him like a week-
old birthday party balloon. I'm
not being accusatory, and I hope
you don't find this offensive. I
just thought it best that it be put
on your radar before any further
damage was done.
In the novel "1984," George
Orwell writes, "A lunatic is just a
minority of one." You may wonder
what that has to do with you, or
why I would tell you such a silly
little quote. I will explain itto you,
in simple terms that you might be

able to understand regardless of
your veil of ignorance.
Being gay isn't wrong. Regard-
less of how against basic civil
rights you are, one day homosex-
uality won't be a thing gawked
at on the street, or made fun of
drunkenly. Faggot won't be said
by anyone as ignorant as you to
anyone as innocent as him. His
rights as the minority won't be
denied to him by your ignorance
as a majority.
"A lunatic is
just a minority
of one."
One day, when you are old and
haggard, lulling yourself to sleep
with the back and forth of your
rocking chair, drooling on your
shirt and existing in a shroud of
your own slow, human decay, you
will be the last one living that
carried such an ignorant hatred
in your heart for something you
never really had the brain power
to understand. One day you will,
be the minority, and you'll look
like a raving lunatic - still trying
to stop a train that will not cease
to move forward towards equal-
ity. I hope you keep your shred
of brainpower until that very
moment when you look around
and feel completely alone, and
then you may speak about how it
feels to be the minority.
Until that day, keep your
drunken ignorance to yourself.

Mays said while he did not
dispute Proppe's executive powers
to establish new commissions, he
believed that convening available
assembly members to discuss
commission matters would have
been appropriate given the history

between the two parties.
However, recent developments
have proven the executive commis-
sions to be open to Senate Assembly
input. Through a new provision that
allows students to pitch ideas for the
creation of new commissions, Mays
will be working with Proppe to
establish a commission that would
encourage more University interac-
tion with the Detroit area.

Wednesday, the Executive
Board opened up applications for
Commission Chair positions.
Mays said forUM would work
with the board to nominate suitable
candidates for the positions.
"We're going to have an open,
positive dialogue about this," Mays
said. "That's what forUM's all about
and that's what we've always want-
ed to do - have transparency in gov-

ernment."
Moving forward, Proppe said
meetings will need to be held to
determine whether last year will
be considered a valid year for the
expired commissions.
"We'll work to correct and move
forward," Proppe said. "We can't
change what happened (last year)
but I'm really happy to work with
the Commission chairs."

CTE
From Page 1
While much of the regents'
July decision addresses policy
previously unaddressed by
University guidelines, the
University has provided in-state
tuition rates to undocumented
students on a case-by-case basis
for at least the past two years.
The University granted in-state
tuition to 80 percent of about
2,000 applications for resident
classification during each of the
past two years.
Though the admissions process
will remain unchanged, Fitzgerald
said the University must ensure
undocumented students are aware
of recent policy changes.
"For quite some time, (the
issue of tuition equality) was a
clear focus and now we're simply
focused on implementing this poli-
cy that we think is really important
to the University," Fitzgerald said.
Morales said CTE plans to keep
pressing for increased access for
undocumented students. Hoping
the group and administrators
can convene another task force,
akin to the one that successfully
explored tuition equality policy.
CTE probably will not resort to
protests this time around, though
they will retain a continued
presence at regents' meetings.
Financial aid forundocumented
students is the next big issue
the University must address.
The average income of an
undocumented family is $27,000,
roughly the same cost of in-state
tuition at the University.
Currently, undocumented stu-
dents are ineligible for federal and
state-funded student aid. Morales
said CTE wants to encourage the

creation of a scholarship fund for
which undocumented students
would be eligible, potentially part
of the University's upcoming capi-
tal campaign.
"Are they going to treat
them equally or will there be
discrimination in that process?"
he said. "CTE wants to hold firm
and work with the administration
(to ensure) they hold to the pledge
for all students."
In light of a decision largely
influenced by student organizing,
Morales said the regents' new
policy has also energized student
movements across the state,
specifically those devoted to
tuition equality reforms.
He said CTE plans to work
with organizations already on
the ground at nearby institutions
such as Wayne State University,
Eastern Michigan University and
Michigan State University.
Though the decision has
provided significant traction to
the movement, tuition equality
still faces its share of critics.
Last month, University Alum
and CTE founder Kevin Mersol-
Barg appeared on Fox 2 Detroit to
discuss the University's new pol-
icy opposite Wayne State student
and Michigan College Republi-
cans chairman Michael Stroud,
who railed against the changes.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily last month,
Rep. Jeff Irwin (D - Ann Arbor)
expressed concern over a
potential judicial challenge to the
University's policy. Irwin said he
would continue fighting to write
tuition equality into state law with
legislation he proposed in April.
For CTE, the campaign contin-
ues; for University administrators,
the implementation of a new poli-
cy is just beginning.

Can increase patient
ability to handle lethal
doses of radiation
By KAITLIN ZURDOSKY
Daily StaffReporter
University research has recently
proven that cancer patients may be
able to withstand potentially lethal
does of radiation treatment.
Chemotherapy is a standard
treatment administered to a patient
to destroy cancer cells. However,
high doses become dangerous
when the drug, which often fails
to discriminate between cancerous
and healthy cells, causes irrevers-
ible damage to healthy cells.
Associate Dentistry Prof. Dr.
Jian-Guo Geng and his team have
pinpointed the gastrointestinal
tractn as anotentia luin 'to n

damaging doses of chemotherapy.
Their study, recently published in
the scientific journal Nature, shows
that if the gastrointestinal tract
is protected, it is able to nourish
tissues in the body to increase
the potential of healthy tissue
survivingthe radiation treatment.
"If you have more intestinal stem
cells, you will be able to repair the
damages caused by chemotherapy,"
Geng said.
Geng and his colleagues,
discovered that when a specific
protein, Robol, binds with the
molecule Slit2 on intestinal stem
cells, this mechanism boosts cells'
healing effect.
By adding extra stem cells in
the gastrointestinal tract, healthy
tissues could be shielded from
the radiation without decreasing
tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy.
While a natural amount of
intestinal stem cells heal damaged

of extra stem cells enhances the
protection of the intestine. The
"normal" amounts of stem cells
cannot guard the body from
damage done by chemotherapy.
When the application of the
additional stem cells was tested
on mice, results showed overall
lessened gut impairment and lower
fatality. About 70 percent of mice
survived the potentially lethal dose
of chemotherapy, compared to the
100 percent mortality rate in mice
without stem cell treatment.
Gengsaid the next step will be to
translate his study to humans. He
said his study will be FDA approved
within the next few years.
In the future, if gastrointestinal
tract studies on humans prove suc-
cessful, this area of treatment has
the potential to help people under-
go higher doses of chemotherapy
so that the malignant tumors can
be targeted and eradicated without
