It’s a situation many students 

have found themselves in: It’s 
the day before an exam or paper 
is due, and they haven’t started 
studying. Many students The Daily 
interviewed said they can often 
feel hopeless. At the last minute, 
when there seems to be no other 
option, these students illegally find 
and consume Adderall, a stimulant 
pill that gives them more, take 
away the need to eat or sleep, and 
probably costs around $5.

Of the over 1,300 respondents to 

a survey released by The Michigan 
Daily, 25 percent said they had used 
central nervous stimulants such as 
Adderall to complete schoolwork 
or to take an exam. However, 
only 8.95 percent of respondents 
said they were prescribed 
Adderall by a physician or 
psychiatrist. 
Presumably, 

the remaining respondents 
acquired the Adderall by 
buying it from another 
student on campus. 
This was backed 
by the 37 percent 
of 
students 

who 
said 

they were 
prescribed 
Adderall 
and 
given or 
sold 
the 

drug 

to another 

student.

Adderall is an amphetamine-

derived pill, and when prescribed 
it can be extremely efficacious for 
people who suffer from attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder. It 
improves focus and wakefulness, 
and gives these people the ability 
to focus on things they wouldn’t 
be able to focus on otherwise. For 
some who are prescribed, they 
can’t go through the day normally 
without taking Adderall.

Engineering junior Ben Reeves 

has had a prescription since 
fifth grade, and takes 60 mg of 
Adderall XR (extended release) 
every morning. He said it’s hard to 
remember what things were like 
when he didn’t take Adderall. From 
what he can remember, he was 
extremely lethargic, unmotivated 

and 
very 

hungry.

“When 

I am on it, 

I 
can 
focus 

better 
on 

things. I can 

keep 
my 

attention 
on certain 
things 
that 
aren’t 

immediately 
interesting, 
like 

homework 
or 

assignments, 
doing 
laundry, 

any sort of adult 

things,” Reeves said.
“This will make me 

better”
As an Engineering student 

and an computer science student, 
Reeves said he sees the stress 
could prompt people without 
prescriptions to take Adderall, but 
said he hasn’t met anyone who has 
done so nor has he ever considered 
selling his own prescription.

However, other students have 

very opposite experiences. One 
LSA senior prescribed Adderall 
who asked to remain anonymous 
said people ask to buy his Adderall 
all the time.

“Whenever anybody has an 

assignment to do, they’ll ask for 
some,” he said. “It’s literally for 
anything, all the time.”

And when they ask, he sells. He 

said doesn’t use his full dosage and 
he needs the money, so though he 
doesn’t love selling and doesn’t 
consider himself a “huge Addy 
dealer,” he’s willing to take money 
for pills he doesn’t plan on taking 
anyway. It started in high school, 
but he said back then he was just 
giving it out.

“In high school, I didn’t really 

profit from it,” he said. “I wasn’t 
selling it really, I just had a ton of 
these pills that everybody was 
down to take, so I just would 
give them out because I had a ton 
extra,” he said.

Others agreed the increase 

in usage started in high school 
when people were anxious about 
standardized tests and getting 
into the college of their choice. 
One U-M student who said she 
occasionally took Adderall without 
being prescribed said that she first 
started taking it while studying for 
the ACT.

“I really wanted to go here, and I 

thought ‘this will make me better,’ 
and I had access to it, so I just took 
it,” she said.

Students 
who 
weren’t 

prescribed 
Adderall 
described 

similar experiences of taking the 
drug to those who were prescribed: 
There was a general feeling of 
heightened focus and productivity, 
as well as the ability to stay up later 
than usual. Based on interviews, 
another common thread among 
the students who bought or sold 
Adderall was they didn’t feel what 

they were doing was illegal.

One student said she felt that 

comparatively to other prescription 
drugs such as Xanax or Prozac, 
taking 
Adderall 
non-medically 

wasn’t as bad. Her reasoning was 
based on overprescribing.

“I never really thought about it 

as being illegal to be honest because 
I feel like a lot of people who don’t 
have ADD are prescribed Adderall 
and I don’t think it’s like taking 
a Prozac or something that is so 
mentally altering,” she said. “I 
don’t think of it as, ‘Oh, this is like 
a drug.’ Things like Xanax are very 
addictive, and I feel like people that 
are prescribed them usually really 
need them, so I just feel like anti-
depressants and stuff like that are 
a lot more dangerous to use if you 
don’t actually need them.”

Another 
student 
who 
sells 

Adderall said he agreed and used 
a similar argument to back up 
his claim that those who aren’t 
prescribed Adderall should be able 
to take it.

“I think it’s fine I guess,” he said 

when asked about people using 

Adderall non-medically to study. 
“I don’t know. I mean I’ve used it 
for that myself, I don’t know that 
I have any condition that actually 
warrants a prescription for it, but 
since doctors overprescribe it so 
much. My doctor back at home 
was just like, ‘Hey, do you have 
trouble focusing?’ and I was like, 
‘Yeah,’ and he was like, ‘Ok, 20 mg 

of Adderall.’ ”

Is Adderall really less risky?
While 
overprescription 

may be an issue, the idea 
that Adderall is less 
severe than drugs 
like Xanax is a 
misconception.

Adderall 
has 

been 
classified 

a 
Schedule 

II 
drug 
by 
the 

Drug 
Enforcement 

Administration. 
According 

to 
the 
DEA’s 
website, 

Schedule II drugs are “drugs 
with a high potential for abuse, 
with use potentially leading to 
severe psychological or physical 
dependence.” Other Schedule II 
drugs include methamphetamine, 
cocaine and oxycodone, while 
drugs such as Xanax are Schedule 
IV, meaning that they have a low 
risk for abuse and a low risk for 
dependence.

Students who sold Adderall 

seemed to recognize that there 
were health risks associated with 
taking 
Adderall 
non-medically 

but in general did not seem too 
concerned with the legal risks.

“I don’t feel like I had to be 

extremely careful about it,” one 
student said. “I really only sold to 
people that I knew personally, so 
I knew that they weren’t going to 
snitch or whatever. But yeah, it was 
more casual.”

One student said he was more 

concerned about it in high school, 
but at the University he never 
really worries.

“I never really worry here,” 

he said. “I think in high school 
it sketched me out a little more, 
because it’s not something I 
wanted to do in school.”

Carol Boyd, the director of the 

Center for the Study of Drugs, 
Alcohol, Smoking and Health 
in the School of Nursing, was 

confused 

as 
to why students 

felt there were low risks when 
selling Adderall.

“Well it’s a felony, so I don’t 

know why they think that,” Boyd 
said. “They’re delivering Schedule 
II drugs, it’s just like delivering 
heroin or morphine or Oxycodone. 
It’s exactly the same as somebody 
who is selling Oxycodone on the 
street. Exactly.”

Boyd, who has been at the 

University 
for 
31 
years, 
has 

had a longstanding interest in 
substance abuse. She picked up 
that the overprescription issue was 
probably part of this unwarranted 
nonchalance in regard to Adderall, 
which was in line with what the 
students themselves were saying.

“It’s ubiquitous, and physicians 

prescribe it, and prescriptions 
have gone up dramatically over the 
last years, and I believe that just 
like with oxy, it creates this social 
narrative that somehow it is safe,” 
Boyd said. “So in the last 10 years, 
Adderall use has nearly doubled. 
The interesting thing to me is 
that Xanax is a Schedule IV, while 
Adderall is a Schedule II. But it’s 
because they think that everybody

Students designate Adderall abuse as nationwide issue, often overlook long-term health effects and addiction potential

Wednesday morning, to a 

crowd of more than 50 faculty 
and staff members, University 
of Michigan Chief Diversity 
Officer 
Robert 
Sellers 

acknowledged there is work to 
be done in making misconduct 
reporting 
more 
accessible 

for 
faculty 
on 
campus. 

Sellers moderated a panel 
to discuss the University’s 
institutional 
response 
to 

sexual misconduct.

The panel featured five 

speakers 
whose 
positions 

within the University connect 
to the resolution process for 
sexual misconduct reports. 
The panelists represented the 
Office of Institutional Equity, 
Sexual Assault Prevention and 
Awareness Center, University 
Human Resources, LSA and 
Michigan Medicine. 

Attendees were comprised 

mainly of University faculty 
and staff members involved 
in organizations from the 
Michigan Alumnus magazine 
to 
the 
MHealthy 
Alcohol 

Management program.

Discussion 
centered 

specifically 
around 
sexual 

misconduct by faculty and 
staff members investigated 
under the policies outlined 
in the U-M Standard Practice 
Guide 
201.89. 
A 
different 

policy 
applies 
to 
student 

sexual misconduct.

In his opening remarks, 

Sellers acknowledged while 
sexual misconduct has been 
at the forefront of academia 
in the last decade, recent 
sexual 
misconduct 
from 

administration at Michigan 
State 
University 
has 

highlighted the work that still 
needs to be done. Additionally, 
in February Mark Hoeltzel — 
a former University pediatric 
rheumatology 
specialist 

— faced charges for child 

pornography 
and 
sexual 

relations with a patient.

“We are committed here at 

the University of Michigan to 
efforts to work to make sure 
sexual misconduct and the 
University’s responses to that 
as well as each individual’s 
resources, opportunities and 
responsibilities 
are 
clearly 

stated 
and 
clearly 
made 

evident,” Sellers said.

The 
first 
presentation 

featured Michigan Medicine 
Chief 
Psychologist 
Bruno 

Giordani, 
who 
addressed 

the fears that prevent people 
from reporting cases of sexual 
misconduct 
specifically 

related to the hierarchical 
organization 
within 
an 

institution.

“There is an unequal power 

balance that drives academia

co-chair 
Shelley 
Manis 

announced Wednesday in a 
telephone press conference. 
Manis 
said 
the 
University 

of Michigan still has time to 
meet the union’s demands for 
increased minimum salaries 
and annual raises.

“Let’s be clear,” Manis said. 

“This is happening because 
so far the administration has 
offered 
incredibly 
insulting 

counters to our imminently 
fair demands. Our members 
are highly credentialed and 
dedicated professionals who 
contribute 
substantially 
to 

the educational mission of 
this University and we know 
the University has resources 
to ensure that we can make a 
decent living.”

This fall, a small group 

of 
University 
of 
Michigan 

undergraduate students will 
be the first cohort of the new 
Accelerated Master’s Degree 
Program 
in 
Transcultural 

Studies.

The 
program 
officially 

launched this year, largely 
directed 
by 
Prof. 
David 

Porter, chair of the English 
Department. The effort took 
Porter and a team of dedicated 
University professors six years 
to define and refine.

The program offers students 

from 
diverse 
backgrounds 

the opportunity to earn an 
interdisciplinary 
Master 
of 

Arts degree only one year 
beyond their undergraduate 
study. Students are required 
to take two core transcultural 
studies courses, later selecting 
elective 
graduate-level 

courses in the 11 participating 
departments. 
Grounded 
in 

areas across the humanities 
and social sciences, the degree 
is largely catered to students’ 
visions.

uses it, and every single one of 
them have friends that have been 
prescribed Adderall for at least 15 
years, that they think it is okay.”

Aside from the legal risks, 

Boyd outlined three major health 
risks that can occur when people 
take 
Adderall 
non-medically: 

addiction, psychosis and death.

“They could have an underlying 

cardiovascular 
problem, 
and 

Adderall – like all amphetamines 
– has a black box on it from the 
FDA, because a physician should, 
before prescribing, do a cardiac 
workup on the patient,” Boyd said. 
“If somebody has that underlying 
cardiac arrhythmia, it can throw 
them into a ventricular techocardi 
tachycardia and cause death.”

While this risk is particular 

to 
those 
who 
suffer 
with 

cardiovascular issues, Boyd said 

the other two could happen to 
anyone.

“If you use too much of any 

amphetamine, 
you 
can 
have 

an 
amphetamine-induced 

psychosis,” he said. “The third 
is addiction...it is a Schedule II 
drug because it has some of the 
most addictive potential. If you 
go on the web and look up drug 
treatment facilities, you’ll find 
there are ones that are talking 
about treating people addicted to 
Adderall.”

Boyd listed other side effects, 

some that students mentioned 
experiencing themselves. One 
student who was prescribed 
Adderall but wasn’t sure if he 
really needed it said that he had 
to stop taking it because of the 
adverse side effects it was causing.

“At first it did a lot more,” he 

said. “It made me very productive 
and sort of manic, very talkative, 
but eventually it just got to the 
point where if I took it at any acute 

dose, it would just kind of cause 
chest discomfort and keep me 
from sleeping, and I couldn’t get 
anything done because the chest 
pain would make me panic. I don’t 
really use it for studying anymore 
because it makes me freak out, so 
I can’t study when I’m on it.”

Another student who wasn’t 

prescribed Adderall said that she 
stopped taking it after freshman 
year for similar reasons.

“The side effects to me were just 

too much. I would feel super dizzy 
from not eating and not having an 
appetite, and something didn’t sit 
with me super well about using 
something I wasn’t prescribed,” 
she said. “I know it does things to 
your brain, and I know there are 
bad side effects, and I never felt 
like it was doing enough to make 
those things worth it.”

Boyd said though Adderall 

could work on anyone, the 
supposition that it makes you get 
better grades is false.

“Yes, it does help with 

attention,” Boyd said. “Does 
it help you get better grades? 
No. And the studies are 
robust enough to show that 
people who use Adderall 
tend to have somewhat lower 
grades.”

So why do students take it? 

One student felt students at 
the University use Adderall 
to keep up with a “work hard, 
play hard” lifestyle.

“I think that here people 

want a balance between 
having fun and studying so 
much that they’ll do anything 
to focus extra while they 
can. They’ll do anything to 
get more done so that they 
can participate in all parts of 
school,” she said. “I think the 
people that take it who aren’t 
prescribed it are usually 
people that live a pretty lively 
social life.”

Another 
student 
who 

sells Adderall said it goes 
along with the trend at the 
University of having all your 
work due at one time and 
then weeks where you have 
nothing to do.

“I don’t think it’s a good habit 

to get into, especially if you don’t 
have ADHD, but I’d say in a 
college environment where the 
work level goes from two weeks of 
a ton of shit you’ve got to do to two 
weeks where you’ve got nothing 
at all, the way kids I’m around 
study, I’d say anyone could benefit 
from it in the short term,” he said.

Another student, who has 

never done Adderall, thinks the 
motivation to do it comes from 
some students’ lack of ability 
to balance the workload at the 
University.

“Some people are definitely 

unaware of the health risks, but 
even if they are, they believe that 
the short-term gain is worth at 
least the potential health risks 
of using Adderall,” he said. 
“They believe that the tradeoff 
for improving their grade, even 
though it’s not even guaranteed 
that they will get a better grade, 
is worth those potential health 
risks.”

Some students also talked 

about motivations for buying 
Adderall other than studying, 
such as snorting it before going 
out or suppressing appetites.

“One girl bought it from me 

one time and she was like, ‘Yeah, 
spring break is coming up, so you 
know…’ but it was just like woah, 
that’s not something that ever 
crossed my mind as a reason I 
would take it,” one student said.

Regardless of motivation, the 

drug isn’t hard to find.

“I feel like you could find it in 

literally 10 minutes,” one student 
said, when asked if she ever had 
trouble purchasing Adderall.

Most students agreed Adderall 

abuse was a nationwide issue, 
not just a University issues, an 
idea that was reinforced in the 
new Netflix documentary “Take 
Your Pills,” which offered a look 
at the world of Adderall abuse in 
colleges. The University seems 
to certainly be a victim of the 
epidemic: If students can find a 
drug in 10 minutes that they think 
will help them pass their exams, 
who’s going to stop them?

Fifteen 
years 
after 
the 

University of Michigan went 
toe to toe in the Supreme 
Court defending affirmative 
action, racial demographics at 
the University remain largely 
homogenous. The University 
chapter 
of 
the 
American 

Constitution 
Society 
hosted 

a 
symposium 
Wednesday 

evening to reflect on the case’s 
history and strategize around 
affirmative action in honor 
of the 15th anniversary of the 
landmark Grutter v. Bollinger 
Supreme Court case.

Grutter v. Bollinger upheld 

the Law School’s affirmative 
action policy in a 5-4 decision. 
The ACS invited Law School 
Dean 
Evan 
Caminker 
and 

appellate 
lawyer 
Maureen 

Mahoney 
to 
speak 
as 
key 

figures in bringing the case to 
the Supreme Court.

The 2003 case drew on the 

precedent of the 1978 case 
Regents of the University of 
California 
v. 
Bakke, 
which 

ruled 
affirmative 
action 

policies legal but racial quotas 
unconstitutional.

Caminker, who specializes in 

constitutional law and clerked 

for 
former 
Supreme 
Court 

Justice 
William 
Brennan, 

oversaw the development of the 
Law School’s case. Caminker 
discussed the targeted strategy 
the team used in arguing their 
case.

“The critical factor when 

we approached the Supreme 
Court, not surprisingly, was to 
figure out how to strategize the 
case, how to present the case 

in a way that would convince 
the court to rule in our favor,” 
Caminker said. “In a difficult 
constitutional case, it’s not 
enough to convince the court 
that you are right on the law. 
What you have to convince the 
court that the court wants to 
rule in your favor, in this case 
we had to convince Justice 
O’Connor.”

Mahoney, head litigator in 

the case, has argued 21 cases 
in front of the Supreme Court 
and clerked for Supreme Court 
Justice William Rehnquist. She 
was speculated as a potential 
Supreme Court nominee in 
2005. Mahoney agreed with 
Caminker 
their 
greatest 

challenge in winning the case 
was 
in 
convincing 
Justice 

Sandra Day O’Connor.

“The strategy always was the 

way to persuade O’Connor was 
to persuade her that Powell was 
right, that this diversity was a 
compelling interest and that 
these programs did help the 
nation,” Mahoney said. “But 
what it really meant was that in 
order to persuade her we had to 
wrap ourselves around Bakke.”

Mahoney credited the success 

of the case to the support of 
former President George W. 
Bush and former Secretary of 
State Condoleezza Rice. The 

administration agreed diversity 
was an important issue, leading 
the White House to issue a 
press release detailing its place 
in higher education.

“I suspect that we owe our 

biggest break in the case to 
President George W. Bush and 
Condoleezza Rice,” Mahoney 
said. “The one must-win issue, 
the issue that we could not 
lose was that diversity was a 
compelling interest — it was 
going to be about how to come 
up with a program that would 
satisfy that interest.”

Mahoney 
explained 
how 

hard 
she 
worked 
on 
this 

case. 
She 
wrote 
over 
300 

potential response questions 
and 
conducted 
three 
moot 

courts with a panel of experts, 
including the current Chief 
Justice John Roberts Jr. She 
said at the end of the case, 
former Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist called her by her 
first name, an accomplishment 
in her book.

“I never worked harder on an 

argument and all arguments are 
stressful … but this one had the 
sense that the whole country 
was watching,”Mahoney said. 
“I think I spent more than 
200 hours just preparing for 
the argument and what I did 
and what (audience lawyers) 

have to do is you have to spend 
your time actually trying to 
anticipate any possible question 
that someone may ask you.”

Out of the 21 Supreme Court 

cases Mahoney has argued, she 
considers this case one of the 
highlights of her legal career.

“I really want to thank Evan 

and the University of Michigan 
for giving me this opportunity,” 
Mahoney said. “It was just 
a chance do one of the most 
challenging important cases an 
advocate could ever hope for 
and I know it was a difficult 
choice for them.”

Mahoney 
recognized 
the 

University’s choice to hire her 
for this case was challenging. 
As a Republican and active 
member of the conservative 
community, civil rights lawyers 
were skeptical of her ability 
to argue the case. Caminker 
advocated for Mahoney in the 
hiring process because of her 
sincerity and drive to win.

“We interviewed four or 

five of some of the best moral 
advocates and brief writers 
in the country at the time 
and I ended up championing 
Maureen,”Caminker 
said. 
“I 

thought she gave us the best 
chance 
of 
winning 
partly 

because I think she believed in 
the case and I’m not sure the 

others did and Maureen was 
explaining to us why the case 
was important to her personally 
and the country. I thought at 
the time that she sounds really 
sincere and that’s why I want to 
hire her, and if she’s not sincere 
she’s doing a damn good job.”

Three 
years 
after 
the 

University’s victory, Michigan 
voters approved Proposal 2, 
a ban on affirmative action 
practices in state universities 
and colleges. Black enrollment 
at the University plunged from 
10.4 percent of the student 
body in 2002 to 6.4 percent 
by 2008. Administrators have 
explored 
pipeline 
programs 

and 
expanded 
recruitment 

efforts through initatives like 
Wolverine Pathways and the 
Go Blue Guarantee, but current 
metrics still hover around 4 
percent.

Law student Austin DelPriore 

said he looked forward to 
coming to the symposium as 
the case pertained to such an 
important part of law and the 
public.

“I’m genuinely interested in 

this, being such a consequential 
case,” 
he 
said. 
“It’s 
both 

fascinating being a law student 
and a general member of society 
and it’s a very impressive 
panel.”

contract is set to expire in 
April and bargaining has been 
ongoing since last semester.

Following 
general 

membership meetings on the 
University’s three campuses, 
LEO distributed online ballots 
to members Sunday. Manis said 
80 percent voted in favor of 
authorizing the union council 
to instigate a major job action 
“if bargaining doesn’t progress 
substantially,” 
adding 
the 

University 
could 
adopt 
the 

union’s salary proposals “by 
merely drawing on the money 
generated by our labor without 
having to raise tuition by a 
penny.” 

In 2016 and 2017, lecturers 

produced 
$462 
million 
in 

revenue while the cost of 
employment was $85 million, 
resulting in a surplus of $377 
million. 
LEO 
argues 
the 

University is more than capable 
of raising wages and improving 
benefits by using this surplus. 

Lecturer salary has been 

a 
particularly 
contentious 

issue. Right now, the minimum 
salary for a full-time lecturer 
is $34,500 at U-M Ann Arbor, 
$28,300 at U-M Dearborn and 
$27,300 at U-M Flint.

LEO proposed raising the 

minimum to $60,000 in Ann 

Arbor and $56,000 in Dearborn 
and Flint, with a $1,000 equity 
adjustment for every year of 
service and annual increases 
between 
5 
and 
7 
percent. 

Friday, the University offered 
adding $2,000 to minimum 
salaries in 2019 and 2020, with 
2.25 percent annual raises over 
three years in Ann Arbor but no 
additional increases.

LEO President Ian Robinson, 

a sociology lecturer, said this 
salary package provided no 
improvements 
for 
lecturers 

whose salaries were above the 
minimum.

“The most important piece 

that 
they 
said 
absolutely 

nothing 
on, 
and 
had 
no 

explanation for why they had 
nothing to say about it, was 
that for people who are already 
above the minimum, there’s 
no increase at all for them,” 
Robinson said.

Under the terms of the 

University’s 
proposal, 
in 

2021, the last year of the new 
contract, the salary minimum 
for lecturers would be $40,000 
in Ann Arbor, $34,000 in 
Dearborn 
and 
$33,000 
in 

Flint. Manis called the offer 
“inadequate.”

LEO’s 
current 
contract, 

which 
remains 
in 
effect 

until 
April 
20, 
includes 
a 

clause 
prohibiting 
strikes. 

Additionally, teacher strikes 
and strikes by public employees 

are illegal in Michigan.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald wrote in an email 
the University and LEO will 
continue to bargain “in good 
faith” and remains “hopeful” a 
deal will be reached soon. He 
also expressed concern about 
the effect a walkout would have 
on students.

“A work stoppage or strike 

by LEO members has its biggest 
negative impact on students at a 
critical time near the end of the 
academic year,” he wrote. “The 
university 
believes 
strongly 

that the collective bargaining 
process is effective and there 
is no need for LEO to call for a 
strike.”

Marcus Darden, a lecturer in 

computer science and electrical 
engineering in Ann Arbor, said 
lecturers did not want to strike 
but would if they felt it was 
necessary.

“I don’t want to go on strike,” 

he said. “None of the lecturers 
want to go on strike. None of 
us want to leave our students. 
We work hard and are very 
committed to them and the 
job that we do, and leaving for 
a job action is very distasteful 
to every one of us. But if that’s 
what we have to do, then that’s 
what we’re going to do.”

LEO negotiated with the 

University’s bargaining team 
Wednesday afternoon. Another 
bargaining session is scheduled 

for 
Friday, 
with 
tentative 

sessions planned for Tuesday 
and Wednesday of next week. 
LEO will also host a grade-in 
Thursday before the Board of 
Regents meeting, during which 
lecturers 
will 
address 
the 

board.

General 
membership 

meetings 
with 
lecturers 
in 

Dearborn, Flint and Ann Arbor 
are planned for the first week 
in April.

“At these meetings, we’ll vote 

on whether to exercise the strike 
authorization 
we 
received 

today,” Manis said. “Between 
now and these meetings we 
have several opportunities to 
make ourselves heard to the 
administration and plenty of 
time for administration to bring 
a serious proposal to the table.”

Manis agreed lecturers did 

not want to go on strike. She 
said even if the University 
did not outright accept LEO’s 
proposal, she’d be willing to 
bring an offer that showed 
“serious” 
movement 
toward 

the union’s demand before LEO 
members to decide if such a 
proposal would be sufficient to 
postpone a major job action.

“We want to hear what our 

members will agree to,” Manis 
said. 
“One 
thing 
we 
have 

repeatedly told them is that we 
are not interested in bargaining 
to 
the 
middle. 
We 
need 

substantial, serious offers.”

deans, chairs, full professors, 
associate professors, that sets 
a power balance and we need 
to look at those factors, and we 
don’t have a conversation if we 
don’t do that,” Giordani said. 

Giordani stressed University 

should 
ensure 
no 
one 
is 

discouraged from reporting a 
sexual misconduct incident in 
fear the University will exhibit 
partiality 
to 
senior 
faculty 

members.

“No university will ever be 

an academic university if it has 
the feeling that, ‘Well, it will 
be okay because we keep will 
keep this golden boy by himself 
and 
keep 
him 
away 
from 

undergraduates and graduate 
students and junior faculty 
because he makes us a lot of 
money,’” Giordani said.

At the beginning of the 

semester, The Daily reported 
on a crowdsourced database 
of 
incidents 
of 
harassment 

and assault in academia — 
the University of Michigan 
appeared in reports by faculty 
and former graduate students 
more than a dozen times. 

SAPAC 
Director 
Kaaren 

Williamsen gave insight into 
the confidential resource of 
SAPAC, which often serves as 
a contact point before deciding 

to report a case to the OIE. 
Williamsen acknowledged the 
fact the University is aware 
of the significance behind the 
instances of sexual misconduct 
that go unreported. 

“We know we don’t get a lot 

of reports … and the dynamics 
from institution to institution 
are very similar,” Williamsen 
said. “When thinking back 
to the 2015 Campus Climate 
Survey … I was struck by the 
results for why students are 
not reporting. The top reasons 
are they don’t want to get the 
other person in trouble, they 
blame themselves, they feel 
embarrassed or ashamed, they 
did not think the institution 
would do anything, and they 
did not believe the incident was 
serious enough.”

Williamsen 
continued 
to 

explain how she believes sexual 
misconduct and the fear of 
reporting should not only be 
considered at the individual 
level, but also as a broader 
cultural issue.

Representing 
the 
OIE, 

Senior Director Pamela Heatlie 
highlighted 
the 
specific 

architecture of how a report 
is handled under SPG 201.89 
when a faculty or staff member 
is involved. Heatlie stressed 
in most cases this process is 
amended to fit the needs or 
specific circumstances of the 

parties involved.

The process begins with 

an 
initial 
meeting 
with 
a 

complainant. At this meeting 
before the incident is even 
discussed, 
Heatlie 
explains 

the 
investigation 
process 

and answers any questions 
a 
complainant 
may 
have 

about their privacy or rights. 
Complainants are also allowed 
to bring a support person, but 
this person does not play an 
active role in the meeting.

Following the meeting, a 

report is drafted that includes 
details from the discussion 
with the complainant. This 
written statement is then sent 
to the complainant for review. 

Then, OIE approaches the 

respondent and schedules two 
meetings to first discuss the 
investigation process and then 
to give them a space to respond 
to the allegation. A report is 
then drafted and sent to the 
respondent for review. OIE also 
asks the complainant if there 
are any witnesses or documents 
that may provide additional 
insight into the investigation. 
OIE follows up with these 
sources 
and 
compiles 
all 

information into a preliminary 
report. This preliminary report 
is then sent to all parties for 
review.

The complete report is then 

sent to an investigator who 

will make a finding that can 
be categorized as four possible 
outcomes. Even in cases where 
the report is found to not violate 
the sexual misconduct policy, it 
can be referred to a different 
department, such as Human 
Resources, who then examines 
the situation based on its own 
policies.

Rackham student Dogacan 

Ozturk was in attendance at 
the event and appreciated how 
the University handles cases 
that are found to not violate the 
sexual misconduct policy but 
still may be a concern for the 
University environment.

“What I like most about 

it is how there are other 
classifications in the system,” 
Ozturk said. “Even if it does 
not violate the policy, it can be 
transferred to different offices 
to get the optimal solution for 
these types of cases.”

Ultimately, 
Heatlie 

emphasized 
the 
process 
is 

designed to be as transparent 
as possible for the people 
involved.

“Our whole point is that 

when we get to the end, we 
have looked at everything the 
parties think is relevant and 
everything we think is relevant 
… At the end when we make a 
finding, none of what we have 
considered is a surprise to the 
parties,” Heatlie said.

Prof. Xiaobing Max Tang, 

director of the new program, 
highlighted 
the 
degree’s 

vanguard status.

“This is a new kind of 

master’s degree program. Not 
only on this campus, but also 
in the country,” he said. “I 
think we are one of the very 
few and leading programs in 
thinking about serving our 
undergrad students in this 
capacity.”

Prospective students begin 

their journey by applying 
junior year. If accepted into 
the program, senior year is 
considered a transition year, 
in which students are allowed 
to take one to two graduate-
level courses. Students are 
fully emerged by the fifth 
year of the program, taking 
graduate courses in their field 
of study and later fulfilling a 
capstone project.

This 
year, 
LSA 
junior 

Jeremy Ray is applying by 
the April 1 deadline in hopes 
of being admitted into the 
program for his senior year.

“My areas of interest are 

especially related to this,” he 
said. “It’s also a year off of 
the regular grad school path. 
You don’t have to spend extra 
time, or the extra bills that 
are associated with that.”

Ray studies anthropology 

and 
linguistics 
at 
the 

University 
with 
the 
goal 

teaching 
English 
in 
the 

community or even abroad. 
University 
students 

interested in this program 
often come from diverse areas 
of study, and the degree offers 
them a practical way of fusing 
together their interests.

The 
master’s 
program 

prepares students for futures 
both in academia and careers, 
with easy accessibility into 
fields 
like 
anthropology, 

sociology and the humanities.

“In 
terms 
of 
career 

opportunities, 
I 
think 

what we can prepare our 
students for is a training and 
experience with a variety 
of approaches to not only 
different cultures, but also 
issues of diversity,” Tang 
said. “In thinking about how 
we can understand cultures 
beyond the national border, 
but also cultural difference 
within the national context.”

For 
LSA 
junior 
Ashley 

Tomaszewski, cross-cultural 
understanding is vital, as she 
aspires to enter a career in 
immigration law. Majoring 
in 
both 
political 
science 

and modern Greek, she said 
getting this degree made 
sense.

“Anything that can help me 

be better at translation, kind 
of on the fly, is helpful,” she 
said.

Tang said students will 

have free range in designing 
their 
education 
program. 

Students will work closely 
with their cohort and have 
the guidance of advisers. 
With 
their 
mentorship, 

students will select courses 
that 
will 
speak 
to 
their 

needs and interests, whether 
they 
want 
to 
work 
for 

cultural institutions or non-
governmental organizations.

“I’m doing research this 

summer and next year, and so 
any program that I can find 
that is willing to help students 
with their research and have 
a plethora of advisors to do so 
… is amazing,” Tomaszewski 
said.

Over the past year, the 

program 
has 
received 

inquiries both on a national 
and 
international 
level, 

largely 
in 
part 
of 
the 

program’s 
avant-garde 

nature, Tang said.

As of now, however, the 

program is only offered to 
University juniors. The next 
few years will be dedicated to 
establishing a strong system 
and 
listening 
to 
student 

feedback.

Ray said the novelty of 

the program is attractive, 
as it allows students to mold 
the degree to their personal 
interests.

“It’s 
very 
new, 
which 

means I really get to decide 
a lot of the course work I’m 
doing,” he said.

Tang also emphasized the 

potential extent to which the 
program can grow.

“If it’s successful, there’s 

no reason not to expand it and 
make it available to students 
from outside the University of 
Michigan,” Tang said.

The program encourages 

students to be open-minded 
in their interests. Students 
with a sense of curiosity and 
interest 
in 
multi-cultural 

and personal understanding 
embody the values of the 
program, Tang said.

“You can’t excel if you’re 

not working in the field you’re 
passionate about,” he said. 
“The program is authentically 
a 
program 
that 
allows 

students the opportunity to 
make this discovery.”

ERIK NESLER | COLUMN

A

s my freshman year 
at the University of 
Michigan comes to a 

close, I have been reflecting 
on the racist incidents that 
have happened this year: There 
were the racial slurs written 
on the doors of Black students 
at West Quad Residence Hall. 
There was the video of the 
man 
appearing 
to 
urinate 

on the “Black Lives Matter” 
written in chalk on the Diag. 
More recently, there was a 
student who posted a Snapchat 
of her and her friend with 
blackface 
masks 
with 
the 

caption 
“#blacklivesmatter.” 

There have been numerous 
incidents, both on and off 
campus, and each time many 
people have responded with 
outrage and discussions about 
the problematic nature of 
such actions.

However, 
I’ve 
noticed 

my peers have become less 
receptive to such discussions 
as the year has progressed. 
People don’t really like talking 
about the same issues as they 
keep reoccurring, and I’ve 
found lately people have been 
trying to change the topic 
when such events are brought 
up. I think some students 
are resistant to having such 
conversations because they’re 
tired of discussing the same 
issues over and over again. 
Moreover, because the winter 
semester ends in a month, 
many students are gearing up 
for finals by studying for tests 
and starting to draft essays for 
their classes.

I myself feel drained, and 

there are admittedly times 
when I want to forget about 
issues such as shootings and 
racism 
that 
plague 
college 

campuses. 
Actually, 
there 

are a lot of times when I feel 
this way, even when I’m not 
drowning in schoolwork or 
the news isn’t filled with 
stories about tragedies. These 
feelings aren’t new, and my 
peers and I are not the only 
ones who have them.

In “Bad Feminist,” a book 

of essays by Roxane Gay, she 
discusses how problematic it 
is that sometimes things can 
be hard to hate. She writes, 
“We have all manner of music 
glorifying 
the 
degradation 

of women, and damnit, that 
music is catchy so I often find 
myself singing along as my 
very being is diminished.” This 
sentence resonated with me 
because it reminded me of how 
challenging it is to be critical 
of things that have problematic 
elements to it.

One of my favorite book 

series growing up was the 
“Little House on the Prairie” 
series, yet the entire series 
is based on a family of white 
pioneers who explore land 
stolen from Native Americans. 
One of my favorite TV shows 
is “Gossip Girl,” which has 
no diversity except for Nelly 
Yuki, 
who 
exemplifies 
the 

studious-loser-with-no-friends 
Asian stereotype. There is 
also Raina Thorpe and her 
father, who appear in time 
for Black History Month and 
disappear after being the focus 
of a few episodes. Should I feel 
ashamed for liking a TV show 
about a bunch of rich people 
who are completely unaware 
of their privilege? Probably. 
Do I still watch “Gossip Girl” 
episodes on Netflix when I’m 
bored? Yes.

While enjoying a TV show 

or a problematic song may 
seem like less serious offense 
than 
posting 
a 
Snapchat 

mocking Black Lives Matter, 
the truth is doing so shows 
complicity. I may not have 
created such offensive content 
myself, but the fact I support 
such 
media 
is, 
on 
some 

level, a representation of my 
surrendering to the subjection 
of others. When I was a child, 
I found joy when reading about 
how Laura Ingalls Wilder’s 
family built a home on “Indian 
territory,” and then continued 
moving West without realizing 
that their actions were at the 
cost of many Native Americans 
losing their homes and being 
subjected to the control of 
white Americans. I myself 
reside on land stolen from 
Native people.

I want to say it’s enough 

for me to be critical of myself 
and others, but I can’t speak 
for everyone. It’s problematic 
to support media that subject 
others, and it’s important 
to understand we are all in 
some capacity being complicit 

with 
the 
subjection 
of 

marginalized groups. On the 
other hand, however, if we 
stop supporting or engaging 
in some way with media 
that’s problematic in any way, 
there would be a significantly 
smaller amount of media left 
to consume. I think this is 
a hard line to draw, with no 
clear answer as to what’s the 
best course of action to take.

I think, at least for me, 

all I can do is be critical of 
everything and make sure to 
speak out when something 
is offensive. While this is 
an 
incredibly 
unsettling 

conclusion and makes me feel 
as if I am not doing enough, I 
also know it’s possible to like 
or engage with something 
without 
liking 
everything 

about it. While I like “Gossip 
Girl,” I recognize its faults 
and I don’t idolize it. I like 
“Little House on the Prairie,” 
but I keep in mind as I read 
it that the Ingalls’ happiness 
is ultimately rooted in Native 
American suffering (without 
portraying Native Americans 
as pitiful victims, of course). 
I sleep in my cozy bed in my 
dorm building that was built on 
stolen land, but I never forget 
the land rightfully belongs 
to the Native Americans who 
originally resided there, not 
the University of Michigan.

I never support or condone 

outrightly 
offensive 
acts, 

such as writing racial slurs on 
doors or mocking Black Lives 
Matter. I make sure to make 
my opinion known, no matter 
how tired or disgruntled I 
am, because the fight against 
the 
subjection 
of 
others 

doesn’t stop just because I 
didn’t get a full night’s worth 
of sleep. I am also careful 
when consuming new media 
and make sure the work I 
engage with aligns with my 
beliefs. To be honest, I don’t 
think doing all these things 
is enough, and I’m not sure if 
acknowledging that nothing 
is perfect is enough. However, 
while it may not be enough, it’s 
a part of the solution and it’s 
important to take these steps.

U.S. 
presidential 
election. 

The new developments in the 
Cambridge Analytica scandal 
are only adding fuel to the fire.

On 
March 
17, 
the 

Cambridge 
Analytica 

scandal revealed Facebook’s 
negligence when it comes 
to 
protecting 
user 
data. 

Cambridge 
Analytica, 
the 

London-based 
political 

consulting firm that worked 
with the Donald Trump’s 
presidential 
campaign, 

inappropriately 
(and 

potentially illegally) obtained 
data on 50 million Facebook 
users. Though we don’t know 
exactly what the firm did 
with the data, it was likely 
used to influence an election 
— suggesting Trump may not 
have won the election fairly.

Cambridge 
Analytica 

obtained this data through a 
third-party personality quiz 
app developed by a Cambridge 
University researcher. When 
you take one of those quizzes 
provided through a third-
party app, the developer is 
able to access not only your 
data but the data of all of 
your friends as well. Because 
270,000 
people 
took 
the 

personality quiz developed 
by the university researcher, 
data was collected on over 50 
million people.

To remedy the scandal, 

Facebook could decide to 
simply prohibit any third-
party apps from collecting 
user data. Facebook would 
never make such a decision, 
however, because its business 

model relies on these third-
parties. Facebook generates 
revenue because advertisers 
are willing to pay for space on 
its platform. Advertisers are 
willing to pay more when users 
are more engaged with the 
platform — ideally, advertisers 
want users to be addicted. 

To encourage addiction, 

Facebook 
promotes 
viral 

content 
created 
by 
third-

party apps (like quizzes that 
ask, 
“Which 
‘The 
Office’ 

character 
are 
you 
most 

like?”). 
These 
third-party 

apps also add to Facebook’s 
revenue stream, as they pay 
to be promoted. Facebook 
is thus incentivized to keep 
these third-party apps happy 
— as they are the company’s 
customers.

Related to this issue is 

Facebook’s 
allowance 
and 

active 
promotion 
of 
fake 

news — another form of viral 
content 
that 
sparks 
user 

interest. News that has an 
eye-catching headline (even if 
it is from an unreliable source) 
is exactly what gets people to 
click. The fake news epidemic 
that 
Facebook, 
along 
with 

other social media platforms, 
has perpetuated could have 
damaging effects on society. The 
editorial board of the Wall Street 
Journal wrote, “A few thousand 
Russian ads on Facebook didn’t 

turn the 2016 election, but the 
proliferation of fake news is 
tainting public discourse.”

Because over 110 million 

Americans get their news 
from Facebook, the platform 
must take steps to ensure the 
accuracy of its content. The 
company also needs to ensure 
its algorithms are not actively 
promoting unreliable content 
on its users’ News Feeds.

Facebook needs to realize 

its platform — which reaches 
over 2 billion users worldwide 
— can be dangerous. CEO 
Mark 
Zuckerberg 
has 

recently responded to public 
scrutiny 
by 
asserting 
the 

platform will only promote 
publishers whose content is 
“trustworthy, 
informative 

and local.” I hope Zuckerberg 
keeps this promise — I hope 
users will be more accurately 
informed 
in 
the 
coming 

months and years.

As 
for 
protecting 

Facebook’s 
users’ 
privacy, 

The Economist has called for 
the company to take its data 
protection protocols to a new 
level: “Facebook needs a full, 
independent 
examination 

of its approach to content, 
privacy and data … (which) 
should be made public.” The 
publication’s editors called 
for the creation of a “Data 
Rights Board” that would 
enforce rules and regulations 
regarding the use of user data.

Though the regulations 

that The Economist are calling 
for are intense, I believe that 
they are necessary. Facebook 
is simply too influential to 
turn a blind eye to its negligent 
business practices.

Complete the ‘positive business’ funnel

STEPHANIE TRIERWEILER | COLUMN

A

ccording 
to 
the 

University of Michigan’s 
Ross School of Business 

employment report, 
bachelor of business 
administration 
graduates accepted 
full-time positions 
in 
10 
major 

industries in 2017. 
Close to 40 percent 
of 
them 
entered 

the 
financial 

services 
industry 

and an additional 
20 
percent 

entered consulting. About 10 
percent of masters of business 
administration 
students’ 

internships last year included 
a social impact component, but 
impact was not mentioned for 
BBA internships or full-time 
positions. Just 1.8 percent of 
BBAs entered the non-profit, 
education 
and 
government 

sectors combined.

This report, of course, doesn’t 

give a complete picture of the 
kind of work Business students 
and alumni do in their early 
careers, but it clues us into the 
types of opportunities students 
seek 
out 
immediately 
after 

graduation and for which they 
consider themselves candidates. 
It makes sense finance and 
consulting would comprise a 
substantial percentage of BBA 
graduates’ entry-level positions; 
jobs in these areas tend to 
demand business majors, pay 
high starting salaries, are often 
prestigious and can act as a launch 
pad for a variety of careers.

But unlike many other top 

business schools, Ross School 
of Business identifies “positive 
business” at its core. Its website 
proudly states, “At Ross, we 
develop 
leaders 
who 
make 

a positive difference in the 
world. Become one,” and “Be 
a force for good. Align your 
desire to make an impact with 
our positive business focus.” 
The school also places its 
commitment to sustainability, 
social 
impact 
and 
positive 

business in line with leadership 
development as components of 
its central mission.

Why, 
then, 
is 
impact 

mentioned 
nowhere 
in 

the 
Business 
School’s 
BBA 

employment information? Why 
do few alumni explicitly pursue 
non-profit work and why aren’t 
benefit corporations and social 
enterprises 
well-represented 

among BBA students’ more than 
190 hiring companies?

It’s not that the positive 

business focus is an empty 
campaign. The school offers a 

ton of events, classes 
and 
programs 
that 

aim to inform students 
about using business to 
make positive change 
and support them in on 
campus activities with 
impact. For example, 
one of the first core 
classes in the BBA 
program, 
Business 

Administration 
200, 

includes 
corporate 

social responsibility concepts 
in its curriculum. The Business 
School houses the Center for 
Positive Organizations, which 
operates 
popular 
learning 

programs like Magnify and 
+LAB and hosts the Positive 
Links Speaker Series. Its Center 
for Social Impact hosts an 
annual multidisciplinary Social 
Impact Challenge and several 
student organizations within 
the Business School — like 
Net Impact and Community 
Consulting 
Club 
— 
create 

socially conscious communities 
and opportunities for students 
to work with local non-profits.

I believe one of the main 

reasons many BBA students 
engage in positive business 
activities like the ones above 
but don’t end up pursuing 
related job positions in their 
early careers is because the 
Business School doesn’t frame 
these kinds of career tracks as a 
standard option.

When 
I 
went 
through 

recruiting for internships my 
junior year, I remember several 
classmates had interviewed with 
a dozen or more banks through 
the Business School’s on campus 
recruiting 
system. 
But 
my 

online search for “non-profit” 
under recruiting company type 
pulled up only a single result. 
I 
attended 
an 
information 

session for the Center for 
Social 
Impact’s 
internships, 

which 
outlined 
its 
Impact 

Corps 
program 
and 
grants 

opportunities 
for 
students 

who design their own social 
enterprise, but opportunities 
and 
funds 
were 
extremely 

limited for undergraduates.

While 
MBA 
students 
— 

who typically work for several 
years between undergraduate 
and graduate school — have 
had 
time 
to 
explore 
their 

careers and pursue different 
job opportunities, I believe 
BBAs feel strictly funneled 
into 
the 
major 
buckets 
of 

finance, consulting, marketing 
and accounting. And if they 
are 
interested 
in 
working 

for companies with socially 
or 
environmentally 
driven 

missions, they must sacrifice 
the Business School’s career 
resources and look for jobs 
through off campus recruiting.

In an already competitive, 

high-stakes 
job 
search 

environment, I feel this lack 
of 
representation 
of 
non-

profits, benefit corporations 
and 
social 
enterprises 
on 

campus drives away students 
who would otherwise include 
impact-driven jobs in their 
recruiting process.

What makes a business 

administration 
degree 
so 

compelling — especially in a 
broad program where students’ 
required 
classes 
cover 
a 

number of different functions 
— is its versatility. Practically 
every field needs people with 
management, communication 
and analysis skills. Though 
people might not immediately 
think of business majors when 
they imagine who pursues 
non-profit 
or 
impact-driven 

work, 
these 
organizations 

could benefit immensely from 
employing graduates from top 
business schools like the Ross 
School of Business.

Through 
its 
positive 

business 
campaign, 
the 

Business 
School 
is 
taking 

important 
steps 
toward 

developing classes of business 
students who have motivation 
and accountability in their 
workplaces and communities. 
But 
its 
absence 
of 
non-

profit 
and 
purpose-driven 

organizations in its on campus 
recruiting 
system 
hinders 

students 
from 
including 
a 

valuable path in their set of 
perceived career options.

Are trendy hoop earrings 
culturally appropriative?

STYLE 

“A style that links so heavily 
with 
identity 
is 
not 
taken 
seriously until it is seen on a 
white woman,” Ruby Pivet wrote 
in a piece for Vice.
Recently, hoop earrings have 
become a staple in the wardrobes 
of an increasing number of young 
people of non-Latinx origin. 

If you’re like me, you decided 
to make the purchase because 
you heard hoops were making a 
comeback in 2017. If you’re like 
me, you never gave a thought to 
the significance of hoop earrings 
to others, and more specifically, 
to the culture of others. If you’re 
like me, you would have been 
completely unaware that hoops 
could be considered cultural 
appropriation.
Before I begin, I would like 
to state that I am not picking 
a side in this article. I am not 
determining whether or not 
hoop 
earrings 
are 
cultural 
appropriation because I believe, 
as a white woman, it is not my 
place to decide what is offensive 
to someone else’s culture. I am 
merely bringing up both ends 
of a discussion that I believe is 

important. 
It was not until I decided to 
write a piece on how hoops were 
making a return that I discovered 
Ruby Pivet and her piece for 
Vice. A Latinx writer, Pivet 
recently brought about talks 
that hoop earrings should be 
weighed equally among bindis, 
Native American headdresses 
and braids in terms of cultural 
appropriation.
“Hoops exist across many 
minority groups as symbols 
of 
resistance, 
strength 
and 
identity,” Pivet wrote. Pivet 
discusses her frustration as 
hoop 
earrings 
have 
always 
played a central role in her life, 
and yet members of society are 
claiming that hoops are making 
a comeback. Though Pivet and 
other Latinx women have been 
sporting oversized hoops ever 
since they could remember, it 
is now being labelled as a new, 
cutting-edge 
trend 
because 
renowned and stylish — in the 
eyes of the U.S. media — white 
women are wearing them.
Besides Pivet, other Latinx 
women 
have 
spoken 
out 
regarding this subject. Three 
Latinx students painted a mural 
at Pitzer College in which they 
asked their white classmates 
to stop wearing hoops. One of 
the students, Algeria Martinez, 
brings up an important point 
regarding how society seems 
to embrace hoops when they 
are worn by white women but 
peddles in stereotypes when 
Latinx women wear them. On 
her Instagram account, Algeria 
Martinez wrote: “Because it’s 
cute and aesthetic when they 
wear hoop earrings, but it’s 
ghetto and hard for us to be 
taken seriously when Black and 
Brown bodies wear them.”
The students’ demonstration 
highlights clear discrimination 
within our society. The fact 
that American pop culture is so 
open to adopting the trend when 
Vogue suddenly declares it the 
look of the summer and depicts 
various white women modeling 
it, while phrases such as “the 
bigger the hoop the bigger the 
hoe” are still spoken regarding 
Latinx 
and 
Black 
women, 
is 
obvious 
discrimination. 

Though 
many 
women 
that 
are primarily exposed to this 
discrimination 
from 
Latinx 
and Black communities have 
learned to embrace their hoops 
despite others seeking to tear 
them down, there is an obvious 
problem that mainstream white 
society must look to reverse 
itself.
However, on the other end 
of this argument is the fact 
that hoops did not necessarily 

originate in Latinx culture or 
the “Cholas” neighborhoods of 
Southern California. In fact, 
they were being used in 1500 
BC in Egypt, being worn by 
Julius Caesar to represent his 
power throughout his reign and 
golden hoops were being widely 
exchanged 
between 
pirates 
between 1650-1730. In this way, it 
can be argued that hoop earrings 
do not necessarily belong to any 
one culture as there have been so 
many instances throughout time 
in which another country has 
adopted the hoops as their own. 
These are some of the cries that 
are being made in the comments 
section of these articles.
With these two sides of the 
argument on the table, it’s time 
to consider: Are hoop earrings 
cultural appropriation?

SOPHIA HUGHES
Daily Arts Writer
I 
recently 
witnessed 
a 
conversation 
between 
a 
student and a professor about 
the definition of poetry. A 
student was asked the name 
of one of his favorite poets. He 
replied that while he was not 
very familiar with classical 
poetry, he was a huge fan of 
Kendrick Lamar. The teacher 
then asked whether Kendrick 
Lamar could be considered a 
poet. “Kendrick,” he said, “can 
never be the next Keats.”
The 
response 
to 
this 
statement was amazing. The 
student responded that more 
people were familiar with 
Lamar than Keats; that Lamar 
currently had a much bigger 
influence on popular culture 
than Keats. And when the 
professor 
asked, 
everyone 
in class agreed that they 
were familiar with Kendrick 
Lamar’s work; a couple of 
students claimed that they 
were 
familiar 
with 
John 
Keats’s poetry. Everyone could 
name Lamar’s recent work; 
few could name anything that 
Keats had produced.
I am admittedly not very 
well versed in rap, hip hop or 
pop music. As you may have 
noticed from my previous 
columns, I am much more 
familiar with classical music 
than I am with popular forms 
of music. But even I had heard 
of Kendrick Lamar: My dad 
became a huge fan of Lamar 
this past year after reading 
about To Pimp A Butterfly and 

witnessing his performance at 
the Grammy’s.
On the other hand, I am 
not 
terribly 
familiar 
with 
Keats’s poetry. I read some of 
his sonnets in A.P. Literature 
when I was in high school. 
Besides this, I know little to 
nothing about his career or 
his oeuvre. Historically, I 
can characterize him as an 
English Romantic poet from 
the 
second 
generation 
of 
Romantic poets. I know that 
his poetry is usually grouped 
with 
Shelley 
and 
Byron. 
Besides that, I know very little 
about Keats.

Though our academic and 
cultural 
institutions 
may 
tell us that Keats is a more 
influential 
or 
important 
cultural figure than Lamar, 
the 
experiences 
of 
most 
college students would seem 
to dispute this claim. Though 
I could understand why the 
professor 
might 
suggest 
that Keats’s poetry was of 
a higher artistic merit than 
that of Lamar, doesn’t our 
generation’s affinity for the 
words of Lamar challenge this 

assumption?

One common assumption 
about popular artists is that 
they represent a fad, that the 
work that they are creating is 
of less intrinsic artistic worth 
and that it will be forgotten by 
later generations. But Lamar 
seems to have overcome the 
generational boundaries that 
one would ascribe on a fad. 
My dad, after all, is a 49-year-
old 
Google 
employee 
who 
usually listens to the popular 
music 
of 
his 
generation. 
His appreciation of Lamar’s 
music is a testament to the 
cross-generational appeal of 
Lamar’s music.
The 
inclusion 
of 
hip-
hop music in our popular 
culture 
represents 
the 
gradual 
disintegration 
of 
racial, social and economic 
barriers 
between 
different 
subcultures. 
As 
Lamar 
illustrates, 
artists 
growing 
up in Compton are able to 
integrate themselves as never 
before into the larger cultural 
lexicon, moving past the strict 
subcultures to which they 
were previously confined.
These 
artists 
also 
face 
significantly 
less 
pressure 
to censure their art to meet 
the 
demands 
of 
popular 
culture. Twenty or 30 years 
ago, it would have been hard 
to imagine an artist such as 
Lamar being able to address 
issues of race in such a head-
on manner. Yet modern artists 
can 
address 
these 
issues 
without fears of blacklisting 
and outright persecution, just 
those of conservative outcry 
and negative reviews. Though 
not yet complete, our popular 
culture is constantly becoming 
more inclusive toward artists 
of all walks of life.
For another example of this 
I am reminded of MUSKET’s 
recent production of “In The 
Heights.” As I interviewed the 
cast about this production, 
they kept returning to this idea 
of depicting the real Latinx 

experience on stage. They 
spoke about the failures of 
musical theatre to accurately 
depict 
Latinx 
individuals. 
They spoke of the casting of 
a white actress in “West Side 
Story” 
and 
the 
depictions 
of the Latinx community as 
in this play as violent and 
incapable of adapting. And 
they spoke of the joy they felt 
in positively depicting the 
Latinx community on stage; 
the honor the felt to welcome 
midwestern 
audiences 
to 
the wonders of Washington 
Heights.
Some may view our lack 
of familiarity with classical 
artists like Keats as a sign 
of cultural or educational 
decline. But what good is the 
study of these classical artists 
if they perpetually alienate 
so many members of our 
society? Why should the work 
of hip-hop artists be treated 
as anything less than poetry 
if they represent the spoken 
words of those that were 
historically 
excluded 
from 
poetry?
When it comes to questions 
of John Keats and Kendrick 
Lamar, it is time to challenge 
the idolization of Keats in 
favor 
of 
the 
inclusion 
of 
Lamar. It is time to tear down 
the 
exclusive 
definitions 
we hold of high art in favor 
of 
including 
those 
who 
have been historically and 
systematically prevented from 
being considered as high art.

Genre-defining boundaries 
are 
evaporating, 
in 
some 
instances far faster than we 
can fully understand. We are 
moving toward a world in 
which it is the quality of one’s 
art and not the nature of one’s 
background that determines 
artistic 
merit. 
While 
we 
maintain the exclusive ranks 
of 
great 
artists 
that 
we 
inherited from academics of 
long past, it is time for us to 
widen the lense of what we 
believe to be a great artist. Let 
history take Keats, I want to 
tell the professor, and let us 
take Kendrick.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW: ‘DISTRICT 9’

 Anyone who has spent a 
little time perusing K-pop 
music videos knows that 
some of them feel like com-
plete (and oftentimes action) 
movies, condensed into three 
or four minute-long sequenc-
es. This is not a bad thing; in 
fact, it could not be a better 
thing. It’s what makes it so 
easy to spend hours on You-
Tube watching video after 
video of EXO and BTS.
 This tradition has a new-
comer: nine-member boy 
band Stray Kids. Yesterday, 
they released their debut 
music video, “District 9,” and 
it’s already clear that waiting 
until the next one is going to 
be a struggle.
 The video spends most 
of its time between a creep-
ily sterile facility of some 
sort and a broken-down bus. 
Visually, it’s fantastic; the 
initial shot of all nine mem-
bers lined up perfectly still 

in a room full of green light 
makes the video impossible 
to look away from and, from 
a glittering rose garden to 
the white-walled rooms of 
the building’s interior, the 
images from there on out do 
not disappoint.
 All of it seems to speak to 
a desire to not be contained, 
which takes off when the 
group escapes the facility 
and rides away on the bus. 
The masterfully rapped lyr-
ics are wholesome yet hard-
core at the same time: “They 
just look at us as a bunch of 
troublemakers / It won’t be 
an easy one to change their 
views / But we won’t get 
down on misconceptions 
and bias / It’s our mission 
to prove who we are.” The 
choreography is also creative 
and exciting, whether the 
group is dancing in the park-
ing lot or on the moving bus 
itself.

 As a debut, “District 9” 
does everything it should 
do. It demands the viewer’s 
attention from start to finish, 
and also asserts the question 
of the budding group’s iden-
tity with lines like, “Knock 
it off with your negative 
vibes, back off,” and, “Why 
are you talking like you 
know me though I don’t even 
know myself?” One can only 
hope that the band releases 
new music (and new action-
packed music videos) in 
the near future. Until then, 
there’s nothing to do but 
stick to watching this one 
over and over again.

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘LOST IN JAPAN’

 The thing you need to know 
about Shawn Mendes is that he 
was a Vine kid. More impor-
tantly, he was one of those Vine 
kids who didn’t use the platform 
for tormenting unsuspecting 
parents or siblings, but rather 
used it mostly for showcasing 
musical talents that would have 
otherwise remained hidden. 
Armed with an acoustic guitar 
and a wide smile, Mendes would 
post short clips of him covering 
various Ed Sheeran, One Direc-
tion and 5 Seconds of Summer 
songs (and even a Beyoncé track 
thrown in here and there). His 
rise to fame started here, under 
the pastel green curl of Vine’s 
logo, vocals restricted to bite-
sized, five-second long segments.
 It’s a shallow personability 
that has remained constant 
throughout his music, even as 
Mendes stepped away from 
Vine, entered into record con-
tracts and started releasing 
original albums. His songs lack 
substance, depth or dynamism, 
instead just minute variations 

on the same easily-consumable, 
bred-for-radio sound that has 
been recycled throughout gener-
ations of generic pop stars from 
Ed Sheeran to Charlie Puth. 
And it isn’t a bad sound — catchy 
hooks and predictable melodies 

are easy to sing along to when 
you’re stuck in bad traffic — but 
it’s one that lacks originality; 
music that never goes beyond 
established constraints.
 Shawn Mendes’s newest 
single, “Lost In Japan” fol-
lows the same formula — easily 
memorable “Can’t get you off my 
mind” a bow on top of the whole 
shiny, auto-tune slathered cho-
rus — only with an “edgy” R&B 
twist. Rather than authentic, 
the dancing synth and energetic 
tempo’s upbeat pulse are only 
reminiscent of Calvin Harris’s 

Funk Wav Bounces Vol.1, and 
Shawn Mendes finds himself 
continuing to rip off those who 
came before him.
 To be fair, Mendes is not a 
bad artist. His vocal range is 
astounding, natural falsetto 
reaches add texture to every 
lackluster melody and, as he 
jumps from the smooth crescen-
do of the chorus into the abrupt 
“I could feel the tension / We 
could cut it with a knife” of verse 
one, Mendes is graceful, never 
allowing the delicate warmth of 
his voice to falter.
 “Lost In Japan” is noth-
ing new. Similar to the breezy 
triviality of what came before 
it — songs like “There’s Nothing 
Holding You Back” or “Treat 
You Better” — the single’s best 
feature is its consumerism — the 
nearly universal sentiment that 
can be found within Mendes’s 
manufactured confession of love.

Nederlands Dans Theater 
performs at Power Center 

COMMUNITY CULTURE 

The 
transient 
nature 
of 
dance has the power, if done 
well, to create windows into 
a world we would otherwise 
never experience. This weekend 
Nederlands 
Dans 
Theater 
brought not one, but three 
universes to our doorsteps.
On 
Friday 
and 
Saturday 
night, Nederlands Dans Theater 
performed at the Power Center. 
Filling the house from the front 
row to the back of the balcony, 
it was packed with students, 
faculty, Ann Arbor locals and 
people from all over the state. It’s 
not often a triple bill show gets 
a standing ovation more than 
twice, at least not in my time 
at the University, or even at the 
large performances I’ve seen at 
Lincoln Center. When it comes to 
NDT, it seems like no one in the 
audience wants to stop clapping.
The Dutch dance company 
is based in The Hague, and has 
maintained 
its 
international 
reputation as a leader in dance 
for 
decades. 
The 
program 
included two works by artistic 
director Paul Lightfoot and his 
artistic partner Sol León, as well 
as “The Statement” by Crystal 
Pite.
“I think our works, even 
though they can be so varying, 
each of them has a relationship 
to social structures, but also 
our connection globally and 
as human beings within each 
other,” Paul Lightfoot said in an 
interview with The Daily before 
the shows. “Worlds apart, but 
at the same time transmitting 
a lot of messages about how we 
connect as people.”
The opening number, “Shoot 
the Moon,” is an NDT signature. 
Dancers immediately take the 

audience to a painfully deep 
place of human connection and 
isolation. Revolving walls creates 
three separate rooms where 
we watch relationships unfold 
and meld together. The fluid 
vocabulary of the movement 
alone creates tension between 
bodies, 
between 
the 
self. 
Lightfoot and León choreograph 
facial 
expressions 
that 
are 
simultaneously convoluted and 
impossibly beautiful. Music by 
Philip Glass drives the piece 
to 
reveal 
vulnerability 
and 
incredible 
resilience 
— 
it’s 
no wonder the long-standing 
repertoire of 12 years continues 
to be well-received.
“I hope we set a kind of an 
example of what you can do 
with 
something,” 
Lightfoot 
said. “(Dance) has always been 
regarded, I think, as the ugly 
sister of the arts compared 
to opera or classical music or 
theatre. Ballet or dance has sort 
of been more frowned upon and 
less elitist and perhaps seen as 
more superficial than it actually 
is.”
The second work by Crystal 
Pite pushes boundaries even 
further. “The Statement” is set 
in a corporate business setting 
with two men and two women in 
suits, based off of her production 
“Betroffenheit.” With an original 
script and sound score, the text 
adds a layer of complexity that 
sets a brilliantly cynical tone. The 
audience laughs at the sarcasm, 
the movement perfectly timed 
and calculated. The dancers 
move with such precision and 
dynamism, it becomes impossible 
to turn away, to close your jaw 
or think of anything besides the 
present 
moment. 
Underlying 
the sweeping movements are 
complex questions surrounding 
guilt and blame in our society 
— a masterpiece that is both 

kinetically and psychologically 
moving.
“I think people are always 
thrilled 
to 
watch 
kinetic 
interventions,” Lightfoot said. 
“They’re top sporters … I think, 
in general, for people to watch 
dance is something that is really 
invigorating — it drives all your 
senses.”
The closing piece, “Singulière 
Odyssée,” made its international 
premiere this weekend. The 
curtain rises and the set alone 
captivates — a European art-
deco train station with altered 
dimensions. 
Lightfoot 
spoke 
about coming across a waiting 
area on his travels from Zürich 
to Luxenburg, when he decided 
to create a dance based on a 
real place for the first time. 
The flawless technicality of the 
dancers stands out in this piece, 
highlighted 
by 
moments 
of 
unison and sustained partnering. 
Autumn leaves fall and flood the 
stage, the rustling leaves adding 
an 
unpredictably 
stunning 
texture.
“When 
people 
come 
see 
a work, they have to be fully 
aware that what they’re going 
to be walking into is a world 
of 
duality,” 
Lightfoot 
said. 
“I think in principle is really 
crucial — the idea of the yin and 
yang, masculine and feminine 
energies. That’s how you get 
transformation.”
The 
abstract 
nature 
of 
the 
pieces 
gives 
freedom 
for 
narrative 
interpretation. 
Regardless of how the narrative 
is received, one thing that is 
undeniable is how sophisticated 
and seasoned the dancers are.
“Forget the works, watch the 
dancers,” Lightfoot said. “It’s 
a beautiful thing to watch this 
group of people. They are ultra-
motivated and at their peak all 
the time. They will recognize 

YOSHIKO IWAI
Daily Staff Reporter

the 
process 
of 
development 
and embrace each other … Like 
butterflies, we don’t have 40 
years to extend our careers. 
We have 20 if we’re lucky, 15 
possibly, 10 more than likely.”
Lightfoot referenced NDT as 
a sort of “mini United Nations,” 

made up of 22 nationalities, with 
dancers from various cultures 
and backgrounds. Words don’t 
do justice to the physicality or 
artistry of this triple bill. The 
only thing I can do is urge others 
to see and experience.
“Art and culture in general 

is building so much force at 
the moment,” Lightfoot said. 
“With 
everything 
manmade 
and natural disasters going on 
around the world, more and 
more you find people looking 
towards culture as a sort of 
trusted outlet.”

‘A Woman, In Bed’ shows 
multifaceted female lust

BOOKS

Anne Finger’s “A Woman, In 
Bed” evades easy classification. 
It’s not really a romance novel, 
and calling it historical fiction 
would be reductive. Set in France 
in the half-century following 
World War I, “A Woman, In 
Bed” follows Simone as she 
moves through the varied bodily 
experiences 
of 
womanhood 
that are often left undiscussed: 
menstruation, 
motherhood, 
abortion, lust, masturbation and 
sexual experimentation.
“A Woman, In Bed” does not 
have particularly compelling or 
nuanced characters. The plot 
isn’t extremely engaging, and the 
prose is often stilted. Instead, 
the strength of this book lies in 
its methodological approach to 
writing about female sexuality 
and 
corporeality. 
Finger’s 
narrative 
is 
an 
unabashed 
and unflinching chronicle of 
the aspects of female life that 
have 
long 
been 
considered 
improper material for literature 
because they are too mundane 
or too culturally or politically 
controversial.
Finger’s 
discussions 
of 
abortion 
are 
especially 
transgressive, and the frankness 
with which she renders the 
procedure and its aftermath is 
almost lurid: “The doctor flung 
the curette down on the table in 
exasperation. Bits of blood and 
tissue flew away from it, dotting 
his glasses, his cheek.” A later 
abortion, this one performed by a 
female doctor, is less emotionally 
draining for Simone, and also less 
physically painful. The doctor 
instructs Simone that if she runs 
a fever and needs to go to the 
hospital to “Be sure to tell them 
you passed something small and 
white. You saw a tiny hand or 

foot. That it fell into the toilet, 
and you were so distraught you 
flushed it away.” The physicality 
of abortion is described in detail, 
as is the emotional aftermath. 

Simone is upset and mourns the 
children she did not have, but 
then she remembers the children 
she does have, the ones who 
barely have enough days-old 
bread to keep from starving, and 

her sadness — not regret — takes 
on a different tone. Finger does 
not condemn or defend Simone; 
instead, she simply describes, 
and lets the reader interpret as 
they like.
Similarly 
unflinching 
are 

Finger’s 
descriptions 
of 
the 
female body when it is simply 
existing. Simone “scraped the 
nail of her pinkie finger along her 
gums, along her teeth, smearing 
the whitish stuff that caught 
beneath her nail,” her breasts 
“began to jet milk” and she has 
“fetid breath in the morning.” 
The 
explicitness 
of 
these 
descriptions are unusual — they 
are not sexual, and they do not 
further character development, 
world-building or plot. Instead, 
they advance Finger’s quest to 
illustrate the richly pleasurable, 
painful and often numbingly 
mundane 
experience 
of 
inhabiting a female body.
The novel is often lethargic and 
stagnant, probably due to the lack 
of character development and 
the clunky plot. The moments of 
clarity are all the more powerful 
given their murky surroundings; 
they emerge from the slushy 
prose like tiny windows into the 
novel Finger could have written 
with a bit more storyboarding 
and editing. “A Woman, In 
Bed” is worth the read just for 
these little gems. Finger deftly 
maneuvers 
between 
desire 
and 
circumstance, 
candidly 
describing 
the 
choices 
that 
Simone makes in a way that is 
neither opportunistic nor cruel. 
It’s rare to find an insistently 
feminist novel or even one 
willing to fully describe the 
complexly entangled pains and 
joys of womanhood. The frequent 
shortcomings of this book are 
especially disappointing given 
the scarcity of novels that 
even attempt to describe the 
embodied experience of being 
a woman with a grace and 
empathy that illuminates rather 
than obscures. “A Woman, In 
Bed” proves that avoiding these 
subjects would be a loss — it’s far 
better (and more interesting) to 
valiantly try and fall short.

Michigan mercies UD Mercy, 15-0

There were so many runs, the 

scoreboard wasn’t sufficient.

When sophomore outfielder 

Haley Hoogenraad hit a grand 
slam — the last in a series 
of 
exclamation 
points 
that 

punctuated the third inning — 
the number of runs displayed 
for the frame clicked from seven 
to one. There was no room for a 
double-digit inning.

The 
game 
started 

inconspicuously. Junior second 
baseman Faith Canfield worked 
a leadoff walk, but the rest of 
the team was unable to follow 
suit — a familiar refrain for the 
Michigan softball team. But 
the 17th-ranked Wolverines (1-1 
Big Ten, 25-7 overall) made the 
contest more and more lopsided 
before defeating Detroit Mercy 
(1-2 
Horizon 
League, 
6-18 

overall), 15-0.

“The biggest thing … was 

just trying to make adjustments 
early,” said freshman designated 
player Lou Allan. “And I think 
that after the first inning, we all 
came together and kinda had a 
game plan.”

Those adjustments showed 

up in the second when two quick 
groundouts were followed by 
three singles, two stolen bases, a 
walk and an error to score three 
runs.

In the third, eight Michigan 

batters came to the plate before 
a single out was recorded. The 
Wolverines got on base by any 
means necessary, from line-
drive doubles to infield singles 
to muffed throws. Every time it 
seemed the Titans would be able 
to stop the bleeding, Michigan 
kept going.

Detroit Mercy didn’t help 

itself, committing two errors 
and throwing a wild pitch. The 
Wolverines 
didn’t 
squander 

those 
chances, 
scoring 
six 

unearned runs in the inning.

“We had to capitalize on 

their mistakes,” Allan said. 
“What we did in previous 

games is get runners on, and 
then we wouldn’t capitalize. … 
It was like, just staying within 
ourselves and just allowing 
ourselves to do what we do and 
play the game.”

And 
when 
Hoogenraad 

deposited a 2-1 pitch into the 
grass beyond left-center field, it 
was just the cherry on top.

“We were all up and excited 

for every little small thing that 
was great that someone did,” 
Allan said. “I think that really 
helped us in the long run to get 
our 15 runs.”

Meanwhile, freshman left-

hander 
Meghan 
Beaubien 

mowed through the Titans’ 
order. She proved that last 
Wednesday — when she couldn’t 
even 
complete 
one 
inning 

before being pulled — was an 
aberration, as she struck out 
nine without allowing a hit.

But no game is over before the 

fifth inning, and for the Titans, 
the bottom of the fourth only 
added insult to injury.

Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins opted to rest her 
starters, instead giving several 
seldom-used 
bench 
players 

looks. And they, too, found 
success. 
Junior 
infielder 

Mackenzie Nemitz earned the 
first hit of her collegiate career 
with an infield single. She 
eventually crossed the plate on 
a bases-loaded single by junior 
utility player Alex Sobczak.

“This game kinda boosted 

our energy a little bit,” Allan 
said, “and made us believe 
our adjustments are actually 
working.”

It was a true team effort, with 

11 different players getting hits 
and two others getting on base. 
Senior first baseman Tera Blanco 
and senior right fielder Aidan 
Falk — two of the Wolverines’ 
heaviest hitters — were pulled 
before 
their 
third 
at-bat. 

Beaubien and freshman right-
hander Sarah Schaefer combined 
for 11 strikeouts and no hits.

Maybe the scoreboard — 

missing digit or not — undersold 
Michigan’s achievements.

“We’re trying to get them to 

really just play the game and not 
play the opponent and to be on 
task every pitch,” Hutchins said. 
“And I thought we were a lot 
better today.”

MATT VAILLIENCOURT/Daily

Sophomore outfielder Haley Hoogenraad hit a fate-sealing grand slam in the third inning to put Michigan up 14-0.

Hoogenraad grand slam feuls ‘M’

For 
Haley 
Hoogenraad, 

there was no better feeling in 
the world than hitting a home 
run. It just happened to be with 
loaded bases.

She said after the game, she 

didn’t know the bases were 
loaded. She just knew it was 
a 
home 
run 

when the ball 
met the bat — 
and that was 
the only thing 
she 
cared 

about.

It was the 

sophomore 
outfielder’s 
first 
career 

grand 
slam 

and the No. 17 
Michigan softball team’s first 
of the season. And at that point 
in the game, it was just icing 
on the cake — the Wolverines 
already had a 10-run lead 
prior to the grand slam and 
eventually 
commanded 
the 

game to a 15-0 win over Detroit 
Mercy in five innings.

But the team was excited for 

her regardless of the score.

“I 
think 
the 
kids, 
they 

celebrate each other’s success,” 
said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “And they also know 
how hard this kid’s worked, 
and she didn’t always get to bat 
for herself. We had her in the 
10-spot a lot. And no kid likes 
that, so she just comes in ... she 
works hard.”

Hoogenraad’s 
grand 
slam 

was proof her hard work bore 
fruit. She wasn’t always given 
the opportunity to make those 
types of plays before.

As a freshman, she played in 

27 games but 
only registered 
14 at-bats due 
to her defensive 
prowess 
and 

lack of offensive 
ability. 
When 

she was in the 
batting lineup, 
it was always 
at the bottom. 
Her average of 
.214, the second 
worst on the team, didn’t help 
either.

That didn’t deter her from 

wanting to bat — it did the 
opposite. It gave her a goal to 
strive toward.

Thanks 
to 

her 
previous 

struggles, 
she 

put in time on 
her 
days 
off, 

searching 
for 

her 
weaknesses 

and fixing them. 
Before 
practice, 

she would arrive 
earlier for extra 
repetitions. After 
she batted, she 

would watch over the video 
to check her form, her timing 
and anything wrong with her 
approach in order to improve.

“She puts in a lot of extra,” 

Hutchins said. “I can’t tell you 
how many Mondays that I’ve 
been in the building, and that’s 
their day off, and she comes 

wandering around to look for 
the video, and she’s got her 
gym shorts on and her batting 
gloves, and she’s out in the 
building. She just works for it. 
It’s really exciting, and we’re all 
happy for a kid like that.”

Coming into her own, she 

increased her offensive load to 
handle 74 at-bats so far in the 
season with an average of .311, 
good for fifth-best on the team. 
All of that set her up for a career 
highlight — a grand slam.

“Well, I think just, she’s 

learned how to hit at this level,” 
Hutchins said. “In a lot of our 
big games this year, she’s had 

some 
big 
cuts 

for us and big 
RBIs and right 
now she’s pulling 
more than her 
weight.”

In the bottom 

of 
the 
third, 

freshman 
first 

baseman 
Lou 

Allan reached on 
fielder’s 
choice, 

allowing her to 

reach first. With junior utility 
player Alex Sobczak hitting a 
single to left field and sophomore 
outfielder 
Thais 
Gonzalez 

walking in a full count, the bases 
were set for Hoogenraad.

The Titan pitcher tried to 

bait her to swing twice, instead 
throwing two balls. With a foul 
the next pitch, Hoogenraad 
prepared herself for a big one. 
A wide swing from her signaled 
just that.

As the ball flew into left 

center field, there was no doubt 
to anyone where it would land. 
But to Hoogenraad, it was proof 
of validation — that her hard 
work was paying off.

“I was so excited,” Allan said 

on Hoogenraad’s home run. 
“I mean, I’ve seen her work so 
hard in practice over the past 
couple days and just for her to 
get that home run, it was a great 
feeling. Any time a teammate 
gets a grand slam, I mean, that’s 
awesome.”

Strong freshmen power Wolverines’ victory

Prior 
to 
the 
Michigan 

baseball team’s game against 
Central Michigan, freshman 
Jesse Franklin was showing out 
in batting practice, crushing 
balls to right and center field. 
At 6-foot-2, 205 pounds, the 
first baseman looks the part, 
and after a tough transition 
earlier in the season, he’s 
putting it all together.

In the bottom of the sixth 

inning, the Wolverines (3-0 
Big Ten, 13-11 overall) clung 
to a one-run lead against the 
Chippewas (2-1 MAC, 7-16-
1 overall). Similar to batting 
practice, Franklin found one 
in his sweet spot and smoked 
a solo shot over the right field 
wall.

Though 
the 
Michigan 

pitching staff proceeded to 
give up two runs in the top 
of 
the 
seventh, 
Franklin’s 

homer sparked the Wolverines 
offensively for the rest of the 

game.

Along 
with 
sophomore 

outfielder Dominic Clementi, 
who lined a single into right to 
bring home two runs, Franklin 
drove in another run in the 
bottom of the seventh.

In the eighth, up by three, 

Franklin continued to deliver. 
Stepping up with runners in 
scoring position once again, 
the freshman hit a gapper 
that plated two more to give 
Michigan a comfortable 8-3 
lead.

Central Michigan was able 

to tack on two more runs in the 
bottom of the ninth, but the 
Wolverines’ lead proved to be 
insurmountable, winning 8-5.

The game started off fairly 

slowly for both sides, but the 
Chippewas broke the deadlock 
in the second inning via a 
sacrifice bunt. Michigan coach 
Erik 
Bakich 
pulled 
junior 

right-hander Troy Miller for 
freshman lefty Angelo Smith.

“Troy was on a 45-pitch limit 

just so we could have him in 

relief for Friday and Saturday, 
with 
the 
doubleheader 

Saturday,” Bakich said. “With 
Angelo, we were just going 
to go one inning, but he was 
throwing so well, and the game 
was so close. We just felt we 
needed to keep him in there.”

Smith provided the much-

needed 
bridge 
from 
the 

third inning to the seventh. 
Smith kept Central Michigan 
scoreless, allowing only one 
hit.

“He 
really 
showed 
us 

something 
today,” 
Bakich 

said. “I thought he did an 
outstanding job attacking the 
zone, being very aggressive and 
consistent with all his pitches 
and his execution. I thought 
that was great to see.”

Another freshman, Jordan 

Nwogu started at left field, 
going 2-for-4 with an RBI. 
Franklin, Smith and Nwogu’s 
successes are the continuation 
of a trend this season. The 
freshmen have stepped up to 
help turn their team’s season 

around.

“Besides having really good 

upperclassmen role models, I 
think the biggest thing is just 
that all of the coaches really 
believe in us,” Franklin said. 
“Even if we do poorly in the 
field, they still encourage us, 
and I think deep down they 
really think we can do it. You 
can really see and feel that 
when you talk to them.”

The freshmen may have 

catalyzed 
the 
victory, 

but 
sophomore 
outfielder 

Christian Bullock and juniors 
Jonathan 
Engelmann 
and 

Blake Nelson consistently got 
on base, combining for four 
runs and three stolen bases 
between them.

“A lot of guys contributed,” 

Bakich said. “A lot of guys 
came off the bench and made 
a difference. A lot of different 
pitchers were used in the 
game, so it was very much a 
total team effort even though 
the 
freshmen 
seemed 
to 

shine.”

Michigan can’t hang on

Mack Lasker finally nailed his 

pommel horse routine.

While the sophomore specializes 

on the event, he has struggled 
throughout this season. But on 
Saturday, he scored a career-high 
14.45 in the No. 7 Michigan men’s 
gymnastics team’s 405.05-407.35 
loss to No. 8 Penn State.

The 
Wolverines 
began 
the 

competition 
with 
five 
clean 

routines on floor exercise, led by 
junior Emyre Cole leading the way. 
Cole scored 14.25, good for the win 
on the event with freshman Jacob 
Moore placing third.

Then came Lasker and his 

teammates’ display on the pommel 
horse. A week after having six 
falls across five routines on the 
apparatus, Michigan had no major 
mistakes. By far the tallest gymnast 
on the team at 6-foot-3, Lasker’s 
long lines brought him success as 
he tied for first place on the event 
with the Nittany Lions’ Stephen 
Nedoroscik, the defending pommel 
horse national champion.

Senior Dmitri Belanovski started 

the Wolverines off strong on rings 
with a simple yet well-executed 
routine that he capped with a stuck 
dismount. His score of 14.10 ended 
up being a team-high on the still 
rings, an unusual result for the 
leadoff athlete.

“He kept the momentum going,” 

said Michigan coach Kurt Golder. 
“It’s always important to get off 
to a good start, and that’s what he 
did. He actually has kind of a pretty 
easy routine, but he really executes 
it well. Got the stick, just gets the 
whole team fired up.”

Sophomore Mitchell Brown led 

off on vault with a score of 14.30, 
and his proceeding teammates kept 
raising the bar. Both Moore and 
redshirt junior Marty Strech stuck 
their vaults, and Cole anchored the 
rotation with a score of 14.75 to win 
his second title of the day.

“The pressure was on for sure 

because I wanted to do a great 
vault, I wanted to stick it,” Cole said. 
“I didn’t want to under-rotate it or 
anything so I kind of played it safe, 
but it was a good feeling just hitting 
back to back to back, increasing the 

score again.”

Though 
the 
Wolverine 

teammates put in four solid 
rotations, the season-long issues on 
parallel bars and high bar returned 
for Michigan in the final two rounds 
of the competition, with three falls 
occurring on each event.

Brown fell in his parallel bars 

routine, 
and 
junior 
Matthew 

Whitaker added two falls of his 
own moments later. Cole was put in 
the unenviable position of salvaging 
the rotation for his team, and he 
rose to the occasion with a score of 
14.35 after ending his routine with a 
stuck double front dismount.

Bock, competing in the all-

around for the first time this season 
after undergoing surgery in January, 
followed Cole with a stuck dismount 
of his own and a score of 14.55, good 
for second place on the event.

“I’ve been hitting my sets pretty 

well in the gym lately, so I think I’ve 
broken through a little barrier in 
that regard,” Bock said. “Just trying 
to crank through the set instead of 
wondering if I’m going to hit it or 
not, so I think that’s made it a lot 
better.”

Michigan maintained a narrow 

lead of just 0.25 points going into 
the high bar rotation, and five 
solid routines would likely have 
been enough to hang on for the 
win. Redshirt junior Alec Krystek 
hit a clean routine in the leadoff 
position, and freshman Jonathan 
Liu followed with a clean routine of 
his own.

But junior Uche Eke ran into 

trouble on a release skill and 
fell, though he finished with a 
stuck full-twisting double layout 
dismount after remounting the 
bar. Two routines later, Belanovski 
fell twice after attempting another 
challenging release skill.

Inconsistency on parallel bars 

and high bar has been a prominent 
feature 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

performances this season and 
is something they will need to 
improve on with the season 
drawing to a close. Saturday, the 
inconsistency cost them one meet. 
In the postseason, it could cost 
them much more.

Brienne Minor makes history

In observance of Women’s 

History 
Month, 
The 
Daily 

launches a series aimed at telling 
the stories of female athletes, 
coaches 
and 
teams 
at 
the 

University from the perspective 
of the female sports writers on 
staff. Daily sports writer Maya 
Salinas continues the series with 
this story.

Brienne 
‘Bri’ 
Minor 
isn’t 

your typical tennis star. She’s 
not the highest-ranked player 
on the Michigan Wolverines’ 
Women’s tennis team. She wasn’t 
even seeded as a singles player 
going into last season’s NCAA 
Championships. 

But on May 29, 2017, everything 

changed. That Monday, Minor 
shocked herself and the rest of 
the tennis world by winning the 
singles championship.

“Going in unseeded, no one 

expected anything from me,” 
Minor said. “I actually loved 
being unseeded. I loved being 
the underdog.”

And it was an underdog 

story for the ages. Minor’s run 
made her the first Wolverine in 
the program’s history to win a 
championship.

“That week I just kinda got on 

a roll,” Minor said. “The team 
event was over; I was just kinda 
playing for myself. … Day by day, 
each match.”

Minor’s 
championship-

winning match — after five 
grueling wins prior — was against 
Florida’s Belinda Woolcock, who 
she defeated 6-3, 6-3. Three of 
the six matches were against 
top-16 seed opponents. When 
Minor won, she threw her racket 
in the air, the defiant celebration 
of someone who beat multiple of 
the country’s best players. 

“It was a surprise to me,” 

Minor said, speaking of her title 
win. 

For 
winning 
the 

championship, she earned a 
wildcard spot at the U.S. Open.

Minor saw all the greats in one 

place, and for a moment, played 
in the same tournament as some 
of her tennis idols. She called it 
the best experience of her life. 

***
Looking back on what shaped 

Minor into the national champion 
she is today, she thought largely 
about her family and their 
influence on her hardworking, 
yet humble demeanor. 

Growing up, Minor watched 

both of her sisters, Jasmine 
and Kristina, play tennis from 
childhood to college, and in turn, 
helped her do the same. To this 
day, Jasmine and Kristina are 
some of her biggest supporters.

As Minor was playing in 

the round of 16 during the 
tournament, her sisters were 
watching from home. Kristina 
was in New Jersey and Jasmine 
was in Washington D.C. at the 
time, but once they saw her win 
that match, they decided they 

had to support her in person. 
Kristina got in the car after work 
to pick up Jasmine, and together 
they drove through the night to 
surprise Minor in Georgia.

Jasmine said that supporting 

her sisters was a principle that 
she was raised with, no matter 
their endeavors.

“We always want the best for 

Bri,” Jasmine said.

And her parents are huge 

supporters too.

“They support us like no other,” 

added Brienne of her parents. 

In a match against Purdue on 

March 25, Minor won 7-6, 6-1, 
just a month and a half after 
returning from a knee injury. 
As her parents watched her 
play, Minor’s mother, Michelle, 
was mostly quiet, but anxiously 
playing with her hands, as if 
her 
daughter’s 
nerves 
were 

transferred into her body. Her 
father, Kevin, watched more 

calmly, taking note of every 
move his daughter made. Both 
parents 
occasionally 
spouted 

something along the lines of 
‘Go Blue.’ But for the most part, 
they sat quietly, supporting their 
daughter in a nervous silence. 

And that’s just against Purdue. 

One can only imagine what they 
were like during that Monday in 
May.

***
More broadly, Minor made 

history as the first African 
American woman to ever win 
the singles title. The last African 
American to win a singles title 
in Division I tennis was Arthur 
Ashe over 50 years ago.

Minor 
plays 
in 
a 
sport 

dominated by white athletes, 
despite 
tennis 
having 
a 

worldwide presence. Tennis has 
always been mostly white, and 
the Minors felt that firsthand. 

“We were the only family 

of color for a very long time,” 
Jasmine said. “We knew how to 
deal with certain things.”

Minor’s biggest inspirations 

outside of her family and her 
teammates 
are 
powerhouse 

tennis 
players 
Serena 
and 

Venus Williams. The Williams 
sisters have done a lot to change 
the face of tennis and foster a 
sense 
of 
inclusivity 
through 

the representation of African 
American females as elite tennis 
players. Their inspiration clearly 
rubbed off on Minor who, after 
finishing her degree, wants to 
play tennis and volunteer in clubs 
where kids don’t always have the 
same opportunities and resources 
she had growing up. 

Jasmine told the story of how 

other young African Americans 
reacted when they interacted 
with Minor on the tennis court.

“Even if you go to a Michigan 

women’s match you’ll see all 

these little Black kids that come,” 
Jasmine said. “They crowd 
around Bri. They go straight to 
her above anybody else, and it’s 
not because of how good she 
is. It’s because they finally see 
someone who looks like them. … 
And that’s a big deal.

“I don’t think people realize 

what it’s like to go your whole life 
and not see someone who looks 
like you.”

Added Kristina: “It’s hard to 

imagine what you’re capable of if 
you’ve never seen anybody do it 
before.”

By 
becoming 
a 
national 

champion, Minor gained not 
just the title, but the platform 
to increase the representation 
of African American women 
in tennis even further and to a 
young audience.

“Just being able to represent 

that group is just really something 
special to me and I hope I can 
pave the way for younger African 
American female tennis players,” 
Minor said, “and really younger 
tennis players in general, just like 
Serena and Venus did for me.”

These 
goals 
should 
be 

important to tennis as a whole.

In college tennis during the 

2015-16 season, less than 400 of 
the almost 9,000 female tennis 
players were Black, excluding 
Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities.

The numbers for male tennis 

players are even lower; only 218 
of 7,842 male tennis players in the 
2015-16 season were Black.

But minority representation in 

tennis is slowly improving. Minor 
hopes to positively contribute to 
this change.

“This is uncharted territory 

for her, I think for all of us,” 
Kristina said. “There’s definitely 
something bigger surrounding 
what Bri has done.”

Watching the Williams sisters 

taught Minor that she could 
play tennis regardless of her 
background if she was willing 
to work hard. Now, she has the 
chance to transfer that message 
to the next generation.

Junior Brienne Minor looked up to the Williams sisters growing up, and now, after winning a national championship, she has her own chance to inspire others.

Two weeks in January

It’s March 29, 2018. The Michigan 

hockey team is in the Frozen Four, 
two games away from winning 
the 10th national championship in 
program history.

Think back to March 16, 2017. 

Three early Penn State goals handed 
the Wolverines a quick exit from the 
Big Ten Tournament, a merciful end 
to their worst season in three decades.

Think back to April 10, 2017. After 

33 storied years behind the Michigan 
bench, 
coach 
Red 
Berenson 

announced his retirement, leaving 
behind a program firmly entrenched 
in a rebuild and with no one in 
charge of construction.

Last weekend, a 6-3 win over 

Boston University in the NCAA 
Northeast Regional Final made 
it 
clear 
that 
the 
Wolverines’ 

rebuilding phase was over. But the 
victory wasn’t quite an emphatic 
declaration that “Michigan is back.” 
In reality, that’s a statement that the 
Wolverines have spent the last two 
months making.

It’s a statement that began with 

two weeks in January.

***
The first day of 2018 marked the 

Wolverines’ nadir. In the opener 
of the Great Lakes Invitational, a 
mediocre Bowling Green team fired 
four goals past sophomore goaltender 
Jack LaFontaine within the game’s 
first 
24 
minutes. 
Michigan’s 

comeback effort fell short, and it 
settled for a disappointing third-
place finish in the tournament.

Coming off a third-place GLI 

finish in 2017, Michigan was 8-9-1 
and 1-3 in conference play. This 
season appeared different at first, but 
for all the promise the Wolverines 
showed in a road win at defending 
Big Ten champion Penn State and 
a win and a tie against then-No. 4 
Minnesota, their record on Jan. 2 sat 
at just 8-8-2, and 3-5-2 in the Big Ten. 
Nothing seemed to hint at anything 
other than last season’s fate.

“We weren’t at a happy point 

in our season,” said sophomore 
forward Jake Slaker. “But we still 
had a lot of games left, and we knew 
we could turn it around.”

Looming next on the Wolverines’ 

schedule, however, was then-No. 
2 Notre Dame, which had yet to 

lose a Big Ten game. Michigan 
met the Fighting Irish at Yost Ice 
Arena coming off just two days of 
rest and without freshman forward 
Josh Norris, sophomore forward 
Will 
Lockwood 
and 
freshman 

defenseman Quinn Hughes, all of 
whom were then competing for the 
United States at the World Junior 
Championships.

Five minutes into the game, 

Notre Dame scored a power-play 
goal. Five minutes later, it added 
another. The Fighting Irish machine 
was operating exactly how it was 
supposed to. Until suddenly, it 
wasn’t.

Senior forward Tony Calderone 

slid a goal past Notre Dame 
goaltender Cale Morris to halve the 
Wolverines’ deficit in the first period. 
Michigan outshot the Fighting Irish 
by almost double during the game’s 
final 50 minutes, producing odd-
man rushes and grade-A scoring 
chances at will. In the end, Notre 
Dame held on to win, but only thanks 
to a Herculean effort in the crease 
from Morris.

“We really had a great game, 

but we didn’t have Norris, we 
didn’t have Hughes and we didn’t 
have Lockwood,” said Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson after Tuesday’s 
practice. “And I thought we coulda 
shoulda won the game. I think 
we outchanced them in scoring 
opportunities, we just didn’t finish at 
key times.”

Added 
sophomore 
goaltender 

Hayden Lavigne: “That was kind 
of where we realized — I don’t even 
think it was the whole weekend, it 
was the first game where we could 
compete, and we probably deserved 
to win it.”

Not only did the Wolverines take 

this newfound confidence with them 
to South Bend for the series’ second 
game that Sunday, but Norris and 
Hughes — only a day removed from 
World Juniors — rejoined the fold.

The 
freshmen 
fit 
into 
the 

lineup seamlessly, teaming up for 
Michigan’s lone goal in the third 
period. A second straight 2-1 loss 
wasn’t the result the Wolverines 
hoped for, but at the risk of using 
the admittedly fuzzy term “moral 
victory,” that’s exactly what it was.

“(Hughes and Norris) played 

extremely 
well,” 
Pearson 
said. 

“Another one-goal game, a tough 

loss. But I think then, you could see, 
we’re not far off. You don’t walk out 
of the rink feeling like there’s no 
chance.”

Out of nowhere, seeds of hope 

showed signs of sprouting. Norris 
and Hughes were growing up on 
the fly. Lavigne brought steadiness 
between the pipes. And for the first 
time all season, Michigan seemed 
to truly embrace an underdog 
mentality.

“Everybody picked us to lose that 

weekend, and we kind of just said 
in the locker room, ‘Screw that,’ ” 
Slaker said. “Like it’s our time to start 
turning around.”

It was nothing-to-lose confidence 

mixed with a healthy dose of urgency 
— even in two losses, the Wolverines 
felt they had put forth their best 
performance of the season.

“That was our first weekend 

where we played two really solid 
games,” Slaker said. “Even though 
we lost, we were really happy with 
our game, and we knew we were 
playing a good team.”

But Michigan still had to win at 

some point — and it would have to do 
so in a place where it rarely does so.

***
The similarities were eerie.
Last season, Michigan traveled 

to Minnesota the second week of 
January. It may not have been the 
Wolverines’ very last chance to 
reverse their season’s trajectory. But 
it was a golden opportunity to gain 
momentum, at the very least — they 
had won only one of their last six 
games at Mariucci Arena.

Instead, two losses to the ninth-

ranked Golden Gophers — neither of 
them particularly close — were just 

two more forgettable episodes of a 
forgettable season.

One year later, on the second 

week 
of 
January, 
Michigan 

received a chance for redemption; 
an opportunity to do what the 
Wolverines of a year before could 
not: turn around their season in 
Minnesota.

However, 
that’s 
not 
exactly 

what Michigan was thinking as it 
prepared that week, practicing on 
the Olympic-sized ice rink of the Ann 
Arbor Ice Cube about 15 minutes 
from Yost Ice Arena in preparation 
for 
Mariucci. 
The 
process 
of 

rebuilding a program isn’t one that’s 
accomplished in one weekend, nor is 
it done by looking too far ahead — the 
Wolverines just wanted to take it one 
game at a time.

It’s one of the most exhausted 

cliches in sports — “one game at a 
time.” But Michigan, heading into 
what it knew would be, in one way 
or the other, a tipping point in its 
season, truly seemed to practice 
what it preached.

“Get the first game and then 

worry about the second,” Slaker 
said. “That’s kind of been always our 
motive throughout the year. If we 
have a two-game weekend, we focus 
on the first one and we don’t even 
worry about the second.”

The Wolverines knew that the 

first one would be a battle. Mariucci 
Arena has broken plenty of superior 
teams before. The wider Olympic 
ice propels the pace of the game 
into hyperspeed, and the Golden 
Gophers’ unprepared, inexperienced 
opponents inevitably run out of 
breath trying to keep up. Minnesota 
is tailor-made for its home arena, 

and for Michigan to have a chance, 
it would have to eliminate almost 
every mistake from its game.

At the Cube, the Wolverines 

drilled 
themselves 
on 
puck 

protection, eliminating turnovers in 
dangerous areas that had plagued 
them for the entire season. They 
stressed immaculate defensive zone 
positioning, countering the Golden 
Gophers’ ultra-talented skaters in 
space.

“Everything was just faster and 

harder,” Calderone said. “Everyone 
was just competing more, and you 
could just see a completely different 
team.”

Meanwhile, a potent mix of 

nervous energy, quiet self-assurance 
and fuel from being overlooked 
powered them through that week’s 
practices. On their bus ride to 
Mariucci before the series’ first 
game, that mix was easily apparent 
— Pearson described it as one of the 
quietest pregame buses of the year.

“We knew what we were up 

against, and it was just an extra level 
of people being focused and dialed 
in,” Slaker said. “Little bit of nerves 
and a little bit of excitement. People 
just had their headphones in, doing 
their pre-game rituals, just dialing 
it in.”

Added Pearson: “This isn’t really 

a quiet team. So when they’re quiet 
like that, you know something’s 
going on.”

Sure enough, something was. 

Senior forward Dexter Dancs gave 
Michigan the lead with a snipe just 
15 seconds into the game.

Despite the blazing start, the 

first contest eventually became the 
battle the Wolverines anticipated. 
Minnesota controlled the game’s 
tempo, and Michigan spent much of 
the game trying desperately to hang 
on.

But the Wolverines did — even 

through surviving a 27-19 shot deficit, 
surviving a six-on-four situation 
in the game’s final moments — and 
pulled off a crucially-needed, 5-3 
victory.

“I don’t think anyone really 

expected to sweep,” Lavigne said. 
“But we went in there and we won 
the first game … and that kind of led 
us on to believe — second game, you 
know what, this is our game as well.”

The series opener opened the 

floodgates — if Friday was Michigan 

at its most intense and sharply 
focused, Saturday saw a looser, freer 
group take the ice.

The end result was the same, but 

it never felt as close as it did a night 
before. Norris and junior forward 
Brendan Warren both scored in the 
first three minutes, Lavigne made 
17 of 18 saves and the Wolverines 
allowed just two shots in the third 
period, claiming their first sweep in 
Minneapolis since 1977 with a 3-1 
win.

“We played hard at Minnesota,” 

Pearson said. “It’s a tough place to 
play — an Olympic sheet, there’s 
some adjustment there, but we 
played a very solid defensive game. 
Just coming off the Notre Dame 
series and winning the game now we 
had some mojo, we were starting to 
get some swagger to the game and 
some confidence.”

You know what happened next. 

Riding that swagger and confidence, 
Michigan returned home to face 
Penn State, and behind two lights-
out displays from Lavigne, the 
Wolverines held the nation’s top-
ranked scoring offense scoreless in 
even-strength play on their way to a 
second straight sweep. Since Jan. 7, 
Michigan has lost just four games.

“We just started to see that we 

could win, we just had to get better 
in a little bit,” Pearson said. “Ask a 
little bit more from everybody else, 
and I think that’s what happened at 
Minnesota and then you got some 
confidence going home. Play Penn 
State, and all of a sudden you’re 
rolling. It’s like that snowball rolling 
down the hill, it just starts growing 
and growing, and there’s no stopping 
it.”

Two months after the Wolverines 

swept the Golden Gophers, a full-
blown 
avalanche 
tore 
through 

Massachusetts, laying waste to 
Northeastern and Boston University.

At the heart of that avalanche is 

the original snowball that began 
rolling down the hill during those 
two weeks in January.

The ingredients are simple, if a 

bit predictable. Stable goaltending, 
disciplined 
defense, 
balanced 

offense, talented youngsters starting 
to blossom, grit and confidence — 
lots of confidence.

And they’ve taken a once-

rebuilding, once-left-for-dead team 
all the way to St. Paul.
